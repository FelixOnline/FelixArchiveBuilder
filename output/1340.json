    "content": "Teachers - Series 4 (Cert. 15)\nHHHHI\nH\nello. Firstly, my apologies for last weeks\nbout of crude lan-guage. Ainsley Harriot\nwas drafted in and\nJoe\u2019s mouth has been thoroughly\nrubbed and scrubbed with Fairy\nPowerspray. We promise it will not\nhappen again.\nOn Wednesday last week, the\n\u2018grand\u2019 finale of Lost aired on\nChannel 4. The double episode was\nsupposed to reveal the answers to all\nthe secrets according to the adverts\nI heard. I say \u2018heard\u2019, I didn\u2019t watch\nthe adverts. Despite my best efforts\nto avoid the adverts by pulling the\nduvet over my eyes and covering\nmy ears with my hands, the spoilers\nseeped through my fingers. Blimey,\nI love Channel 4, but they are awful\nfor that!\nAnyway we were expecting, rather hopefully, to discover: what was\nin the hatch, what was the smoke\nabout, what the bloody hell were the\nloud growling noises in the woods,\nwhat the heck are polar bears doing\nthere, what was so special about\nWalt, what about Claire\u2019s mysterious\nbaby and why couldn\u2019t Charlie have\nactually died when he was hung?\nOk, perhaps not the last one, but\nI still ask that question whenever\nthe annoying pleb opens his gob.\nThe point is: viewers were in for an\naction packed few hours in which a\ntension greater than that of Hurley\u2019s\nbelt would be relieved.\nUnsurprisingly perhaps, we found\nout almost jack shit. Even though\nthe actors were tormented by some\nmechanical sounding \u2018monster\u2019, we\nnever got a view of it. The smoke\nturned out to be a simple beacon,\ntv\nA\ns a pupil, you have preconceptions that teachers are blank, with little\nor no personality; they\ndon\u2019t have lives outside\nof their sorry, underpaid exist-ence. Teachers are almost robotic\nmachines that operate Monday to\nFriday, 8 till 6. They only know how to\nshout and strike their red ball-points\nin a crossing motion, or stroke in an\n\u201cF\u201d motion if they\u2019re the US model.\nOnce the end of school bell has rung\nthey return from bus duty, in single\nfile of course, to their corner of the\nstaff room and mark books. After\nsticking down the very occasional\ngolden star, they walk on the left\nhand side of the corridors to their\nstore-cupboard and power down for\nthe night.\nGoing out, smoking and drinking are treats reserved for the rare\nlunch down the local pub on teacher\ntraining days. Not so for the teachers\nof Summerdown Comprehensive. A\nnew term and a merger with another school means the old tobacco\nchimneys: fatty Lindsay, blonde sexpot Penny and \u201cfucking fucker\u201d Bob\nare joined, smoking in the bogs, by\nsome new recruits. Ewan is like-able, handsome and gullible; Ben\nis a neurotic RE teacher but \u201cnot a\nfucking Christian\u201d and Damian is a\nsarcastic loser. This bunch of booze\nguzzling twenty-somethings are far\nfrom the Demon Headmaster. They\nwalk through corridors swearing\nlike troopers, whilst in the background little Bobby, little Freddy\nand tiny Timmy are all getting the\nshit kicked out of them. School is literally a riot for these kids. Children\nfight with medieval swords and\nanother set of pupils even fire off a\nmilitary mortar! However, if there\nwas a school award for most childish\nmember, the teachers would win it\nevery time here.\nAt Summerdown, the bell is cer-tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nbut little more was known about it;\npolar bears were never mentioned;\nClaire\u2019s baby was kidnapped by the\nFrench woman and Walt was kidnapped by a band of scruffy folk.\nThe episode even ended by fading\nto black as Locke and Jack peered\ninto the hatch. All in all, even more\npieces of plot were created than\nresolved! American cinema is\nrenowned for explaining every last\ndetail of a story, so leaving something for the viewer to think about\nis often refreshing but Lost took the\npiss. This happened throughout the\nseason. Whenever something was\nrevealed, such as the polar bears,\nthe following episode the islanders would get collective amnesia\nand forget all about them! Episodes\nrarely continued to the next. To end\nan entire season in such a manner\ngives little reward to the audience.\nLost was a chore to watch at times,\nyet I must give it some credit for\nmaking me return each week and\nprobably next season. Channel 4\u2019s\napology after the final show made\nme laugh and certainly summed up\nthe frustration neatly.\nGood riddance to Jodie! The\nwoman who modelled her nose on\nWinter Olympics ski jumps was\nevicted from Celebrity Big Brother\nlast week. Good! Her attempts at\nproving she was not a slag/bitch/\nmoron/cow/whinge-bag failed miserably and she actually just confirmed the media\u2019s portrayal. In one\ndiscussion she said something along\nthe lines of \u201cI just wanna go out and\nstick my tongue down some bloke\u2019s\nthroat, get wasted and have my\nfriends hold my hair back as I throw\nup down the bog.\u201d A classy lady\nindeed. The eviction evening was\nodd though. During the phone vote\nadvertisements, Jodie was booed\nloudly, but upon eviction was greeted much more kindly. Even Davina\u2019s\ninterview seemed diluted; probably\nto avoid her topping herself there\nand then.\nAnyway folks, see you next\nThursday!\nTomo Roberts\nG\n\u2019day again! Now which\nwhacker spat the\ndummy over my clearly\nunappreciated nappy\ntalk last week? I thought\nbrain boxes like you lot would overlook my blue, and appreciate a bit of\nslang banter from one of us common\nblokes Down Under, but I\u2019ll cop it\nsweet with Ainsley\u2019s magic hands.\nYou see, we all need to spread\nthe love, like that anonymous donor\nand his 250 smackaroos. Fair suck\nof the sav; his blood\u2019s worth bot-tling! Makes a change to all the dirty\nbizzo that\u2019s been going on around\nErinsborough.\nAlthough there is a lot of man-to-man love spreading goin\u2019 on in the\n\u2018house of trouser\u2019. Rougher than the\nwrong end of a pineapple I say! I\u2019ve\nnever heard of a camp bushie, but I\ncan see that Toadie wearing a thong\nunder his suit. Plus I think he\u2019s got a\nphoto of Lance \u2018the horticulturist\u2019 in\nhis wallet, right next to his doodles.\nLucky if that Conor has any doodles with the business he\u2019s getting\ninto. Italian standover men are\nno wowsers. He\u2019ll probably cark it\nbefore Alex does.\nAlong with the house of \u2018bend over\nand take down your trousers\u2019, and\nthe Timmons herd in their bus, this\narea is becoming real couky. All\nwe need now is a rasta carrying\na boombox in the name of Radio\nRaheem.\nRattle my bones all over the\nstones, I\u2019m gonna stop this yabber-ing to \u2018fight the power and increase\nthe peace\u2019.\nJoe Mangel\nLast week\u2019s TV DVD Review\ntainly a signal for the teacher, not\nthe pupils; a signal for them to rush\nto the bar at \u2018The Orange Tree\u2019.\nHere they rip the piss out of each\nother, constantly. Lindsay is \u201cnot\npregnant, just fat!\u201d; Bob has applied\nfor a Thai bride on the internet;\nBen becomes obsessed with OAPs\nand there\u2019s gay awareness week\nin which head teacher Claire tries\nto discover \u201cwhat exactly is it that\nLesbian\u2019s do\u201d. It\u2019s good to see Claire\nhas survived from previous years.\nCod-eyed Carol\u2019s clapping signals\nClaire\u2019s entry into the staff room:\n\u201cShut the fuck up\u201d she announces\nto begin the new term; no changing\nthe ice-queen then. Carol, on the\nother hand, has turned into an even\nangrier, twisted version of Golum.\nShe grunts abuse at people, sprays\ndisinfectant on old people\u2019s seats\nand particularly hates lesbians.\nThe old cast is still excellent and\nthe new faces fit in pretty well too\nbut I couldn\u2019t help feel that the creators were using Ewan, Damian and\nBen to replace Simon, Kurt and\nBrian from earlier series. Damian\nand Ben are the idiots, several cans\nshort of a six pack each, and Ewan is\nthe attractive, slightly sharper pencil in the draw. This is a harder task\nthan getting away with insulting a\nFrench teacher by calling her \u201cune\nsalope\u201d to her face. Still, Teachers\nis still as stylishly edited and well\nscripted as ever; sharp and funny.\nTomo Roberts\n23\nfelix\nThursday 19 January 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nStrewth!\n\n"

The winner (winners) of the\nvideo-clip competition is the new\nCIA-wannabes of Imperial College.\nI have to say, I didn\u2019t really understand the item they were looking\nfor. So what exactly made them the\nwinner of the Felix video-clip com-petition?\nThat\u2019s easy, a steady hand, good\npanoramic shots (I\u2019m assuming it\nwas Hyde Park), and the extreme\nseriousness of the actors\u2019 faces when\nthey found the rock. I do admit that\nthe video-clip was in dire need of a\nbetter script writer but otherwise,\nwatching the video-clip told me that\nthis is the winner. Congratulations\nto Hamish Spender and his team!\nThey are the official winners of the\nFelix video-clip competition.\nApart from the quality of the\nvideo, the video-clip was surprisingly hilarious. Of course, you will\nguffaw at the sight of a plain rock\nthat apparently holds the secret to\nwhat they were looking for. What\nmade it more hilarious were their\nattempts to crack the code. Crisscrossing their arms to type on two\ndifferent keyboards, taking huge\nswallows of milk to maintain their\nenergy as they search for the great\nanswer- and all of this is done in\nsome strangely familiar hall-bed-room. You have to give the guys\ncredit for having the ability to pull it\noff with a straight face.\nWhat do they win? 10 free Vue\ntickets to see any show they like,\na crate of beer, DVDs (Kingdom\nof Heaven, Robots and Hide and\nSeek), Nightwatch tee-shirts and a\nlot of other Fox goodies! Congrats,\nguys!\nNow, wouldn\u2019t you love a piece of\nthat? I know, I do. Well, there will\nprobably be another video-clip competition next year. Summer will be\nhere soon (I know, it\u2019s a bloody long\nsix months away), take advantage\nof the three month holday (yes-its\nquite short, I do agree.) and make\na funny, entertaining video-clip and\nmaybe next year your video-clip and\nyour name will be in the papers!\nIts interesting to see what Imperial\npeople get up to. Good luck!\nIt\u2019s time to announce the winners\nof the recent Felix Video-clip\nCompetition\nA\nword of notice: while\n\u2018The New World\u2019 is about\nPocahontas, it is quite\nunlike the Disney ver-sion. In fact, the name\n\u2018Pocahontas\u2019 is not said in the entire\nfilm. I can only imagine that this is\nan effort by the film to distance itself\nfrom the popularized form of the legend \u2013 the sort of good guy, bad guy,\nNewport (Christopher Plummer).\nNewport, in his wisdom, frees\nCaptain John Smith (Colin Farrell),\nthe party\u2019s only professional soldier,\nfrom imprisonment. While Newport\ndeparts for England to bring fresh\nsupplies and men, Smith is sent to\nmake contact with Chief Powhatan\n(August Schellenberg), the ruler\nof the region\u2019s native Indian tribe.\nSmith is captured and about to meet\nsome terrible end when Powhatan\u2019s\nfavourite daughter, Pocahontas\n(Q\u2019orianka Klicher) throws herself\nupon Smith, and begs that his life\nbe spared.\nRather than portray this gesture\nas motivated by \u2018love at first sight\u2019,\nMallick seems to prefer that it be an\nact of compassion. The film is not a\nstory about heroes and villains; as\ndifferent as the British and Natives\nare, the characters are all human,\nand each show their individual virtues and flaws. The conflict that\nerupts between them is borne of\nfear and misunderstanding \u2013 all too\nhuman tendencies.\nThe second half of the movie\ndelves deeper into the character of\nPocahontas, and introduces John\nRolfe (Christian Bale) who begins\nto notice the native girl after Smith\ndeparts for England. Here, the film\ntends to slow down considerably,\nfocusing more on the three principle\ncharacters.\nI suppose if I had to name something wrong with the movie, then it\nwould be that: it moves very slow-ly. This must be partly intentional;\nMallick is fantastic at creating a sort\nof meditative angst, complimented\nby narration by the main characters.\nThe acting is first rate, developing the characters very well, and\nQ\u2019oriana Klicher\u2019s performance as\nthe playful, expressive, and complex\nPocahontas comfortably steals the\nshow.\nIt\u2019s an outstanding movie with talent to spare, but it\u2019s not something\nfor the Friday-night after a long\nweek \u2013 it\u2019d probably just make the\nweek seem even longer.\nMatthew Fung\n\n"

Under current plans,\nstudents across the country will face\na \u00a32,000 hike in their annual fees\nunless MPs are persuaded to take\nthe issue to the Commons later this\nyear. A coalition of unions, including\nteaching unions from the university,\ncollege and school sectors, intend to\njoin the NUS in lobbying MPs to help\noppose the government initiative.\nThe impact of the impending fees\nhas had a marked influence on the\nnumber of university applications\nfor the next academic year. UCAS\nfigures due to be released at the end\nof the month are expected to show\na significant decline in university\napplications despite the government\ntarget to get 50% of 18-30 year olds in\nHigher Education by 2010. \u201cThe evidence is already mounting up that\ntuition fees will not open up access\nto Higher Education, particularly\nfor students from less traditional\nbackgrounds. This is in clear contradiction to the government\u2019s aim\nto get record numbers of students\ninto universities over the next few\nyears,\u201d said Kat Fletcher, President\nof the NUS.\nImperial College, which hasn\u2019t\nbeen a member of the NUS for over\n20 years, had previously attracted\nwidespread media attention over\ntop-up fees due to the Rector\u2019s well\npublicised support. He believes that\ncharging the full economic costs for\ngoing to university will allow more\nmoney to be diverted to those who\ncan\u2019t afford it.\nSir Richard told Felix, \u201cWe know it\ncosts a minimum of \u00a312,000 per year\nto educate our lab-based students,\nwith Medicine being around \u00a325,000.\nWe can\u2019t stop teaching Chemistry,\neven though we\u2019re losing about\n\u00a38,000 per student, because it\u2019s an\nintegral part of Imperial College.\nThe government has to recognise\nthat.\u201d\nThe revised fees, which will mean\nstudents repay the tuition costs of\ntheir education after starting work,\nhave been hailed as a realistic alternative which aims to ease the problem of university under-funding.\nMinisters have repeatedly argued\nthat the \u00a33,000 fee would not act\nas a deterrent to students, \u201cI most\ncertainly do not believe that we are\ngoing to see a major downturn in\napplications. Many students would\nbe better off under the new system,\nwith more generous grants and bursaries,\u201d said Bill Rammell, Minister\nfor Higher Education.\nThe NUS President wasn\u2019t con-vinced, \u201cIf MPs really believe education is the key to social mobility,\nthey need to act now to stop university education becoming a privilege\nreserved for those who can afford it.\nWe are calling on them to support\nthe coalition in fighting against any\nremoval of the cap which could see\nuniversities charging five figure fees\nfor an education.\u201d\nThe coalition group came together at the House of Commons on\nTuesday, 17 January, for the NUS\u2019\nAnnual Reception. The event\nwas hosted by Ian Gibson, MP\n, an\nardent campaigner against top-up fees, alongside representatives\nfrom across the education sector.\nCommenting on the potential for\nsuccess amongst the coalition,\nGibson said, \u201cThe coalition lays the\nfoundations for real long-term interaction between those who represent\nstudents and those who represent\nteachers, lecturers and staff working in our schools, colleges and uni-versities, which is very exciting. I\npledge my full support to the coalition and I look forward to working\nwith them in achieving their aims.\u201d\nCoalition \ufb01ght top-up fees\nChris Miles\nYour Imperial policy?\nGordon Brown called for a \u2018British\nDay\u2019 to celebrate British achieve-ments, history and culture when\nspeaking at a left-of-centre Fabian\nSociety conference in Imperial\nCollege last Saturday. He set out his\nbelief that we should build a \u201cstrong,\nmodern sense of patriotism\u201d and\nreclaim the Union flag from the far\nright.\nIn his speech, the Chancellor questioned the lack of a declaration of\nour national objectives and the need\nfor a British version of the Fourth\nof July, America\u2019s Independence\nDay. He remarked that perhaps\nArmistice Day is the closest equivalent we have to commemorate\n\u201cstanding firm for the world in the\nname of liberty.\u201d\nThe idea of a day to celebrate\nBritishness was widely supported,\nthough reservations were made\nabout combining it with Armistice\nDay or Remembrance Sunday.\nAnother suggested date was 1 May,\nthe day the Act of Union came into\neffect in 1707, uniting England and\nWales with Scotland to form Britain.\nThe Scottish Nationalist Party was\nquicktorefutetheideaofBritishness\nas well as attacking Brown, suggesting this is mere positioning in his\naspiration to be Prime Minister.\nMr. Brown emphasised the importance of being clearer about what\nit means to be British, suggesting\nthat if we were more confident of\nour British identity, we could have\nacted decades earlier in supporting\nAfrican countries and not cowered\nin the shadow of our past role as an\nimperial power. He also attributed\nit to the slow speed of reform, citing the \u201cfear of losing our British\nidentity\u201d as key to our avoidance\nof addressing constitutional issues\nsuch as reform of the House of\nLords.\nWhilst welcoming this, the Tories\ncautioned Brown not to attempt to\nanswer the question of Britishness\nwithout building a consensus.\nOliver Heald, Conservative Shadow\nSecretary of State for constitutional\naffairs, said, \u201cbuilding Britishness\nshould reflect the interests not of\none party, but of the whole country.\u201d\nBrown on\nCampus\nNews 1-3\nBusiness 5\nScience 8&9\nFilm 10&11\nMusic 12&13\nNaked Centrefold 14&15\nLetters 18\nBlinddate 19\nComment & Leader 20&21\nTV 23\nMusic 24\nCoffee Break 25\nAgony Aunt 26\nSport 27-28\nThis Week\nAs engineers and scientists, we have\nan immediate and significant impact\non society, for better and for worse.\nFortunately, it is up to all of us\nto define what Imperial\u2019s contribution to society ought to be, and how\nour policy should reflect other ethical issues such as equality, diversity and fairness in student recruit-ment. Imperial College is drafting\na new Ethical Policy Framework to\naddress these questions, and wants\nstudents\u2019 feedback to ensure that a\nconstructive \u2013 and representative\n\u2013 policy is arrived at.\nTake this opportunity to voice your\nAlon Or-bach\nopinion to the framework\u2019s coordi-nator, Pro Rector (Research) Prof.\nChris Hankin. You will find a copy\nof the draft document on the ICU\nPugwash website, where you can\nsubmit feedback through a simple\nsurvey. The survey results will be\npresented directly to Prof. Hankin\nat the end of this month, along with\nthe conclusions from a debate which\nICU Pugwash will host on 24 January\nto discuss how the proposed policy\ncould be implemented. We hope to\nsee you there - see our website for\ndetails!

The\noffer is \u201copen to all\u201d applicants, who\nsimply have to show a \u201cdemonstrable interest in the financial services\nindustry\u201d.\nDeutsche ensured that the \u00a33,000\nthey will be providing matches the\namount universities will be able to\ncharge in tuition due to top-up fees,\nstarting this year. They hope that\nthe bursaries will help them stand\nout more to students as a future\nemployer. However, the winners of\nthe bursaries won\u2019t be under any\nobligation to join the bank after\ngraduation. So if you were looking\nfor more beer money, then look no\nfurther.\n\n"

An entire way of life\nalien to Ancient Greek philoso-phy, embracing an awe-inspiring\nfruition or \u201cGolden Age\u201d when\nEurope was in its Dark Ages,\nand separate from the values that\nignited the Enlightenment era\nin Western Europe where much\nof civilisation stems from today.\nThere was a time in Islam when\nnew patterns of thought and philosophy flourished, coupled with\nadvances in material progress and\nthe spread of an inter-continental\nCaliphate. It is this basis of life\nthat governs the actions for 1.5\nbillion people globally \u2013 and the\nnumber is ever growing.\nI sincerely hope that the interaction will come to highlight the\nIslamic alternative for many\nissues.

Imagine what that means.\nWhenever people meet publicly\ne.g. to work, trade, study, teach,\ntravel or politically participate in\nan Islamic society they are viewed\npurely for what they offer in that\nparticular relationship. They\nare not viewed for their sexual-ity. Gender is irrelevant. Each is\nviewed simply as a human being.\nSexism disappears. No more\nsex objects. No more billboards\nor images of semi-clad women\nrequired to advertise the latest\ncars, music singles or Cadbury\u2019s\nFlakes. No more unrealistic\nexpectations of the female form to\ndrag down a woman\u2019s self esteem.\nIslam also recommends we all\nmarry early allowing us to flourish within marriage so imagine\nno more trying to pull someone\n(or be pulled) on a Friday night.\nOf course living in a sexually-charged society brings its own\ndangers. How many of us fear our\nloved ones could be attacked just\nbecause someone else is sexually agitated? Of course further\nsafeguards come from a Muslim\u2019s\nadherence to ultimate divine\naccountability which links into\nsocial responsibility, giving char-ity, being a good neighbour and an\nupstanding citizen.\nSuch issuse as these are also\nparts of the Islamic way of life,\nwith solutions derived from reasoned deductions from the revelation in a similar way described\nabove. Indeed, perhaps it is the\nlast that is of most concern to\nnon-Muslims. Is there still this\nattitude that Islam is concerned\nonly with the spread of total Jihad\nagainst all infidels with the sword,\nindefinitely, till all is conquered or\nburnt? History can be interpreted\nthis way, but it is also possible to\ndivorce the inappropriate actions\nof individuals from the true\nIslamic viewpoint \u2013 an encouragement to respect human life that\nembodies the utmost care for\nboth Muslims and non-Muslims as\nhumans. It is in this spirit of frank\ndebate and discussion that I\u2019m\nsure we all hope the interaction of\nall peoples with far ranging views\non life\u2019s matters will occur.\noughly investigated and if there is\nevidence of a crime being committed then a police prosecution would\nfollow.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s troubling us at Felix\nmost is how anyone could be stupid enough to have thousands of\npounds lying around their room.\nThat sort of money is just a temptation too strong to ignore.\nLibrary: 24/7\n& redevelopment\nLast year, the library was one of the\nmost contentious issues covered\nby Felix. The conditions, frankly,\nwere disgusting and definitely not\nconducive to effective study. If 24/7\nis to work successfully this year,\nstudents must respect the facility\nand each other. If you see anyone\nbrushing their teeth or washing\ncabbage in the toilet take a picture\nand we will name and shame them\nin Felix.\nSome students have been sent\nemails by their senior tutors telling them to \u201cget a good nights rest\nbefore exams\u201d. Doesn\u2019t having the\nlibrary open 24/7 contradict this\ngood advice?\nHopefully, once the redevelopment has been completed, the\nlibrary will be a more pleasant\nplace to study and we will finally be\nassured of finding a spare place to\nstudy.\nWe want to hear your views\non these issues, please email\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

With\nthe intention of highlighting\nthe Palestinian plight to the world,\nthey killed and captured the rest of\nthe Israeli Olympic team. Despite\nGermany\u2019s efforts to recapture the\nhostages, all of the Israelis were\nkilled 21 hours later.\nMunich isn\u2019t a story about how\nthe family members of the Israeli\nOlympic team handled the tragedy.\nThis is a story about how the Israeli\ngovernment decided to stop the killing of Israelis by taking an eye for\nan eye. They call it the \u201cOperation\nWrath of God\u201d.\nThe operation is led by the young\nand inexperienced intelligence\nofficer, Avner (Eric Bana). The\nrest of the assassination team consists of the getaway driver, Steve\n(Daniel Craig), the document-forger\nHans (Hanns Zischler), the Belgian\ntoy-turned bomb-maker, Robert\n(Mathieu Kassovitz) and the cleanup man, Carl (Ciaran Hinds).\nThanks to Dreamworks Ltd. And\nSublime movies, Felix has 5 pairs\nof tickets to give away to our loyal\nreaders. And these tickets are for\na special preview screening just for\nstudents on the 23rd of January.\nNow, the question remains. How\ndo you get your hands on those\ntickets? It\u2019s time for a little history\nquiz.\n1. What is the name of the Palestinian\nextremist group that invaded the\nOlympic Village in Munich?\n2. Who was the head of the Israeli\ngovernment who staunchly refused\nto negotiate with the terrorists?\n3. What event led the German government to free the three surviving\nmembers of the Palestinian extremists involved in the Munich mas-sacre?\n4. Which PLO bases did the Israel\nAir Force bomb as a response to the\nterrorist act on September 9th?\nThe five people who get the highest\nnumber of correct answers and send\nin their replies by 20 January will be\nthe lucky five to watch Munich for\nfree. (And a mate too!) What are\nyou waiting for? Google the answers\nand hurry!\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nYour mission: To kill and not get killed in the processs.\niCU cinema:\nmoney is scant after all the New\nYear celebrations.)\nNext week, they are showing\nKeeping Mum and Mrs. Henderson\nPresents. Are you asking me what?\n(Seriously, don\u2019t you even keep up\nwith the times? I mean, pass the\ngeneral news over and at least\nscan the upcoming movies section.\n*Kidding.)\nKeeping Mum features Mr. Bean\nor Rowan Atkinson in a serious role.\nThe gist is that he plays a pastor and\nhis family is falling apart from his\nbiblical obsession. If you are a fan of\nthe man himself, you wouldn\u2019t want\nto miss this.\nThe next one is Mrs. Henderson\nPresents. Maybe most of you didn\u2019t\nhear about it, but it\u2019s a British film.\nMaybethat\u2019sanotherreasontowatch\nit? ( Perhaps it\u2019s the odd streak of\npatriotism.) To sum it up, it\u2019s a show\nabout a widow who decides to start\na theatre with nude-acts. Sounds\ninteresting? (Perverts.) You should\ncheck it out. After all, it got a 7/10\non imdb. And imdb is rarely wrong\n(except in the case of A lot like love.\nThey seriously hate Ashton Kutcher.\nIt\u2019s prejudiced!)\nOkay, now, why am I telling you\nall this? Because iCU cinema is\ngiving out free tickets. On Tuesday,\nbe the first four people with this\nFelix article to get to iCU cinema\nand get a free ticket each to watch\neither Mrs. Henderson Presents or\nKeeping Mum. (Your choice!)\nRemember the times: 6 and 8pm\non Tuesdays and Thursdays. Check\nout their listings on the iCU cinema\nat www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/cinema.\nGet your sneakers ready and good\nluck!\nFree tickets! Pay attention now\nThese beauties are ready to take centre stage, without any clothes on!\nNow, I\u2019ve been to tons of cinemas.\n(Unfortunately, yes.) And as a result,\nI should expect myself difficult to\nimpress. (insert hilarious laughter)\nHence, why do I think you should\nvisit iCU cinema?\nFirstly, you\u2019ll be surprised but\nthe sound quality of their \u2018cinema\u2019\nis actually very good. It definitely\nbeats downloading the movie off\nthe Internet, watching it on laptop\nspeakers (the horror!) and it\u2019s definitely legitimate. (Hence, you don\u2019t\nhave to worry about being tracked\nand later trialed in court by some\nominous movie company.)\nSecondly, the movies are fairly\nrecent. The people at iCU cinema\npay good money to ensure that\nyou get to see the best movies in\nthe comfort of your own campus.\nConsidering it receives Union sup-port, not going to the iCU cinema\nwill be tantamount to paying the\nunion and not using the amenities\nprovided. (In English, that would\nmean, it\u2019s utterly stupid to not go to\nthe iCU cinema.)\nThirdly, it\u2019s in campus. Need I say\nmore? Especially first-years who\nstay in Beit Quadrangle, you don\u2019t\neven need to don the heavy winter\ncoat to watch a movie. You don\u2019t\nhave to take a bus or a tube ride to\nget there. (This means, that you do\nnot have to suffer being harassed by\nstrange people who decide to go on\ntracks and hence cause a huge delay\non the tube line.)\nLastly, it makes perfect economic\nsense to visit iCU cinema. It\u2019s only\n3 pounds and since you don\u2019t have\nto take a bus or a tube, visiting\nthe iCU cinema is just perfect for\nthe skimpy student budgets. (Yes,\n\n"

For the\npast week and a half Londoners\nhave been pouring in off the gloomy\nstreets and into the Dana Centre,\nand leaving twenty minutes later\nfeeling distinctly more cheery. The\nreason for the new state of Nirvana\nin this corner of London is the \u2018Light\nLounge\u2019; a pure white room in the\nDana Centre with comfy sofas,\nfluffy pillows and four rectangular\nlight boxes mounted on each wall\nto beam positive vibes at all comers\nand eradicate all traces of the winter\nblues.\nThe Light Lounge coincides with\na Dana Centre debate on Seasonal\nAffective Disorder (SAD), a form\nof winter depression that Jennifer\nEastwood, founder of the SAD asso-ciation, says affects more than half a\nmillion people every year in the UK.\nAs a person living with SAD, Mrs\nEastwood is more than familiar with\nthe effects of the condition. \u201cIt was\nimpossible to get up in the morning\u2026I was very ill; I had to be put in\nhospital. And tThen they turned the\nlight therapy on me and it started\nto work\u201d. That was 25 years ago,\nand now Mrs Eastwood controls her\nSAD symptoms with medication and\nthe use of a light box in her office in\nthe Imperial College Department\nof Environmental Science &\nTechnology. The number of people\nwho contact the SAD association\nevery winter, when the days become\nshorter and light quality poorer, suggests that SAD is more than just a\nneed for a holiday or a bad case of\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nfelix\nThursday 19 January 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nDon\u2019t feel SAD\nLilian Anekwe enjoys a light therapy session\nVisitors enjoying the Light Lounge at the Dana Centre.\nReclining on\nthe sofa, lazily\nflicking through\nMarie Claire and\nenjoying the\nsilence, does\nunsurprisingly\nmake me feel\nbetter\nI\nnvestigators are looking into the possibility that Professor Lord Robert\nWinston\u2019s moustache is fake, following\na statement by a colleague from his\ntelevision series Child of Our Time.\nThe claims are the first to be made on\nrecord, following months of rumours\nwhich have dogged the respected scientist and\nbroadcaster.\nKaren Flotilla, the researcher who made the\nclaims, described the crucial moment when\nshe became aware of Winston\u2019s apparently\nfraudulent facial hair: \u201cWe\u2019d just wrapped on\na day\u2019s filming near Bristol when I was told by\nthe producer to deliver the next day\u2019s script to\nLord Winston in his hotel room. I knocked and\nhe called for me to come in \u2013 he was locked in\nthe bathroom, freshening up. He told me to\nleave the script on the desk; he sounded flus-tered. Then I saw it. It was on the floor. At first\nI thought it was a hairy caterpillar, maybe the\nGiant Leopard Moth larva, but then I looked\ncloser and noticed a small patch of double-sided tape. It was definitely the moustache.\u201d\nDr Ezekiel Peabody, author of The Cult of\nWinston (Palgrave, 2004), pointed out that if\nthe allegations were found to be true, Lord\nWinston\u2019s career could be ruined: \u201cI\u2019ve long\nmaintained that his curious allure is built\nlargely from his fascinatingly thick \u2019tache.\nAs Samson\u2019s locks were to his strength, so\nRobert Winston\u2019s moustache is to his intellectual standing and on-screen personality.\nWithout that bushy growth he may well be\nfinished.\u201d\nSupporters of Winston are said to be reeling from the news, but Sally-Ann Slocombe,\nfounder of the Ealing-based Bob\u2019s Fan Club\n(BFC), is defiant: \u201cSure, the moustache means\na lot to us, but it isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all of\nLord Winston\u2019s appeal.\u201d Slocombe went on to\npoint out that Winston is also a highly-respect-ed medical expert, having sat on numerous\nhigh-profile government advisory panels, and\nthat he has hosted dozens of documentaries\nand authored just as many books. As Twiggy\nTeather, a BFC member, said: \u201cHe\u2019s demonstrated not only his expertise in the sciences,\nbut also his thorough understanding of theology in his latest book and TV series. And, of\ncourse, there\u2019s that lovely, thick barnet.\u201d\nThe world of television moves on quickly\n\u2013 it seems the position of cuddly bewhiskered\nexpert is up for grabs. TV producers have\napparently discussed the possibility of bringing in another man to fill Winston\u2019s shoes\nbefore he has even been formally investigated\nand Ladbrokes has started offering odds on\nthe front runners to be the next moustachioed\nmedia scientist. Heinz Wolff is third, at 22-1;\nAdam Hart-Davis is next in at 11-2 but the\nfavourite is Sir David Attenborough, at 5-2.\nJim Badger, celebrity barber of New Bond\nStreet, commented on the potential of the three\nmen: \u201cWolff has good follicles, but he\u2019ll have to\nbe dragged out of retirement first. Hart-Davis\nhas just trialled a beard on Balderdash and\nPiffle, but I\u2019m not confident he\u2019s got the right\ntop lip for the job. As for Attenborough, I love\nthe guy, but I think his bristle-density isn\u2019t\ngoing to be up to scratch. The field\u2019s wide\nopen.\u201d\nLord Winston\u2019s moustache was not available\nfor comment.\nWinston\u2019s\nmoustache\nDuncan\nMcMillan\nthe winter blues: \u201cIt seems that light\nis the main thing. Medication does\nhelp but that\u2019s more for the depression side, what the light seems to\nalleviate is the very characteristic\nSAD symptoms of overeating, oversleeping and lethargy\u201d.\nIn the luminous glow of the Light\nLounge, I met Lauren Gildersleve,\nthe press officer at the Dana Centre\nwho had the idea for the Light\nLounge: \u201cSAD is something that\ncomes up in the media every year,\nthere are always stories on it but\nthey\u2019re always quite samey. So we\nwere looking for a way people could\nhave some free light therapy, to get\npeople into the centre and get them\nengaged in science, and a way they\ncould learn a bit more about SAD\nthrough the debates and talks running here at the same time.\u201d\nThere is a valid scientific theory\nbehind the light therapy offered at\nthe Dana Centre. SAD is thought to\nbe caused by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus, due to\nthe shortening of daylight hours and\nthe lack of sunlight hours in winter.\nLight therapy can be effective in up\nto 85% of cases when light boxes\nthat provide 10,000 units of light\nenergy (lux) are used. This is the\nsame light intensity beamed out by\nthe light boxes in the Light Lounge;\nby comparison a grey winter day in\nLondon provides a miserable 200-500 lux.\nThe Light Lounge has met\nLauren\u2019s vision perfectly (\u201cI\u2019d envisaged this white, relaxing chill-out\nroom, where it\u2019s quite comfy and\nlaid-back\u201d). Reclining on the sofa\nlazily flicking through Marie Claire\nand enjoying the silence (oddly,\nno-one speaks during my time in\nthe lounge, afraid of ruining the\npeacefulness) does unsurprisingly\nmake me feel better. When I leave\ntwenty minutes later, I feel serene\nand happier in a way I can\u2019t quite\nput my finger on. I\u2019m not alone in\nhaving had my mood improved (\u201cI\nfeel well chilled now\u201d, announces\none happy guy to his girlfriend) and\nseveral people leave the lounge and\nhead straight to the front desk to\nbook another appointment. This\nis common, according to Lauren\nGildersleve: \u201cA lot of people are feeling very relaxed when they come\nout and they\u2019ve said it made a dif-ference. We\u2019ve seen a lot of the\nsame faces, a few people I know\nhave come back three or four times\nalready. We\u2019ve had so much demand\nwe\u2019ve extended the event for another week\u201d. Good news for these punt-ers, who are disappointed to hear\nthe lounge is booked solid for the\nnext two days.\nBut even my twenty minutes in the\nlounge may not be enough according\nto Jennifer Eastwood: \u201cOne thing\nthat one has to be clear about is that\nno matter how much light you get\nfrom an artificial source, it doesn\u2019t\nbeat the real thing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m\noff to Lanzarote next week\u201d. I can\u2019t\nafford to go on holiday again, so I\u2019ve\nbooked another two sessions next\nweek.\nThe Light Lounge at the Dana\nCentre is open daily from 12pm to\n8pm until Friday 20th.\nThe\nNewer\nScientist\n\n"

This was a man who was\nelected in the last general election,\npromising to protect his constituents in a very ethnic area of London.\nSince his election, he\u2019s rarely been\nin the Commons, speaking in only\nfour debates, and missing out on\nimportant speeches that affects the\npeople he represents, including not\nturning up to vote on anti-terror\nlaws, shunning them for publicity-seeking events, including one at our\nvery own university.\nThis sensational ego-stroking\nhas come to a head when this man\naccepted 60 grand to appear on a\nreality TV show, spending the week\ntrying to make conversation with\nMichael Barrymore (in return, he\ngives him dirty scowls \u2013 another\ndiplomatic victory there). Well, you\nmight say it\u2019s as if he hasn\u2019t more\nimportant things to do, such as, taking a purely random example. take\npart in the Crossrail debate in the\nCommons this week; a rail project\nwhich will have massive implications on his Bethnal Green and Bow\nconstituents if it went ahead.\nIn the immortal words of Rolf\nHarris\u2026can you guess who it is\nyet?\n\u201cThe future of Charing\nCross is still uncertain\u201d\npolitics politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFelix catches up with Greg Hands, Conservative MP for Hammersmith\nand Fulham, whose constituency represents many Imperial students\n\u201cCharing Cross\nHospital has the\nsecond largest deficit\nin the UK, which\ncurrently lies at\naround \u00a337 million\u201d\nthat the time saving through the\nextension zone would only be half a\nminute. As a regular bus user I feel\nthat to be a too much of a sacrifice\u201d\nThere was also the problem of the\nimpact on local businesses \u2013 one\nof the main arguments against the\ncongestion charge, and one that\nGreg Hands strongly believes in,\nspeaking of how small businesses\nlose out from passing trade, and how\nit encourages the use of out-of-town\nshopping centres instead, saying\nhow \u201cPlaces like Bluewater probably love the Congestion Charge\u201d.\nThe comparison he made next\nthough was astonishing, citing how\nJohn Lewis in Oxford Street (hardly\na small, local business) lost sales\nfrom the Congestion Charge, whilst\na comparable shop, Peter Jones in\nSloane Square, had no effect. I say\nit\u2019s astonishing, as a quick Google\nsearch shows that the John Lewis\nfigures came from a report (which it\ncommissioned itself) which showed\nan apparent 5.52% drop in sales over\nthe period; but in comparison over\nthe first half of 2005 it showed a 6%\nrise in sales, and managed to buck\nMatthew Hartfield\nPolitics Editor\nG\nreg Hands, for those\nnot politically inclined,\nis the newley elected\nmember of parliament\nfor Hammersmith and\nFulham. Taking the seat in the 2005\ngeneral election, winning with a\nswing of just under 6%, he was one\nof the success stories of the last\nelection, seen as a prime example\nof how the Labour government has\nlost its grip over the last eight years.\nJust before Christmas, he was\nthe guest speaker at the Chelsea\nConservative club, and Felix decided to give him a visit.\nI started off the interview by asking Greg how he felt to be elected\nas an MP\n, after serving on the local\ncouncil. He told us that it was an\nexciting time to be in politics at the\nmoment, citing some of the extraordinary events of the past twelve\nmonths, including Blair\u2019s first defeat\nin the Commons, Britain\u2019s presidency of the EU, and more shocking\nevents, such as the London bomb-ings. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very exciting time\nto be at the centre of politics\u201d is how\nGreg summed it up \u201cI\u2019m pleased\nto be the first Conservative MP for\nHammersmith and Fulham\u201d, noting that due to boundary changes\nhe is the first Conservative MP for\nHammersmith since the 60\u2019s.\nAs the MP for the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham,\nGreg Hands presides over an area\nof London, which is the home for\nmany Imperial students who live\nin Fulham, Putney and Shepherds\nBush. I asked Greg if he has any policies planned them? \u201cOne of our aims,\nwhich is very relevant to Imperial\nin particular, is to save Charing\nCross Hospital\u201d, the main school for\nmedic students, and for which Greg\nhas met with the medic\u2019s students\nunion to help resolve the dispute.\n\u201cWe are also aiming, in a general\nway, to improve public transport in\nWest London, and to reduce crime\u201d,\nincluding trying to get the Piccadilly\nline to stop at Ravenscourt Park and\nStamford Brook. On Charing Cross,\nI asked how certain its future was,\nto be confronted by depressing news\non how the Hammersmith hospital\u2019s\ntrust has the second largest deficit\nin the UK, currently being around\n\u00a337 million in debt, which might\nrequire services being cut and also\nbeing moved to Hammersmith hospital in a bid to save money.\nGreg Hands has also been actively\ncampaigning for other issues around\nthe area, including an appearance at\na demonstration against the congestion charge extension last year.\n\u201cI\u2019m fanatically opposed to the\nCongestion Charge extension, and\nI say that as somebody who doesn\u2019t\nhave a car\u201d he told Felix. \u201cI\u2019m worried for my constituents, who will\nsuffer from the diverted traffic\u201d,\nclaiming that transport that\u2019ll go\nthrough London will naturally divert\nthrough Hammersmith and Fulham\nto avoid the extended zone. What\nabout the effect on public transport,\nI asked? Surely the extension will\nbe a good effect for the many people\nwho\u2019d commute into the capital?\nGreg wasn\u2019t supportive of this argu-ment. \u201cAll the studies have shown\nthe trend of falling Christmas sales\nof 2005, with an increase of 12% from\nlast year.\nOn a lighter note, Greg Hands was\nsad to see the recent decommision-ing of the Routemaster buses, calling\nthem \u201cA great icon for London...It\u2019s a\ngreat shame to see it go\u201d. He wasn\u2019t\ntoo impressed with the reasons for\nits departure: \u201cThe main arguement\nis wheelchair accessability, which is\nfair enough...but how many wheelchairs do you see on those buses?\u201d I\ndid mention, however, that although\nthis may be true, there was the fact\nthat there are a lot of pushchairs\non the the bus these days, which\nthe old Routemasters can\u2019t cater\nfor.. Acknowledging this, he asked\nfor a system where Routemasters\nare running alongside newer buses,\nsuch as the 14 and 414 in Fulham.\nAfter the interview, Greg Hands\ngave a speech to the assembled,\nbut what was interesting was his\nviews on the current state of British\npolitics. Despite supporting Liam\nFox in the recent party leadership race, he gave great praise to\nDavid Cameron, describing how\n\u201cHe has performed increadibly well,\nat Prime Minister\u2019s question time,\nand in various speeches\u201d Pre-determining the resignation of Charles\nKennedy (this was in December,\nremember), he also pointed out that\nwith Blair stepping down at the end\nof his term, the next general election will be the first one since 1979\nwhere there will be three fresh leaders competing for votes - a unique\nmoment, and one that should create\na lot of fertile debate over the next\nfew years.\nThe Sketch\nGreg Hands, Conservative MP for Hammersmith and Fulham,\nspeaking at a Congestion Charge demonstration last year\nPolitics\nFelix\nWe need writers!\nIf you have an\ninterest in current\naffairs and like\nto be put on\nthe mailing list,\ncontact:\npolitics.felix\n@ic.ac.uk\n6\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 19 January 2006\n\n"

The session\ncomprised of two days of intensive\ntraining in many aspects of combat\nwith special emphasis accorded to\nclose-quarters combat. Police officers instructed the eager trainees\nin room clearing, hostage rescue,\nrecon, target practice, moving and\ncovering in disciplined formations\nas well as team-building and com-munication. The teams used Airsoft\nelectric air-rifles and gas-propelled\npistols, as well as flash-bang grenades for the various stages of the\nsession.\nThe most difficult tasks to accom-plishduringthesessionwere:achiev-ing full control over our reflexes and\ninstinctive movements as well as\ndeveloping a method of non-verbal\ncommunication between the members of the squad that reached telepathic levels. Truly amazingly, at the\nend of the weekend we did not have\nto shout commands at each other\nany more as we could automati-Imperial students train with boys in blue\ncally determine when and where\nwe were needed, by merely assessing the given situation briskly and\nputting our newly gained experience\nin motion. As for our reflexes, we\nhad a good chance to see for ourselves that instinctive reactions are\nnot always the best alternative and\nthat a well controlled response can\ndeal with a challenge much better.\nMoreover, we also had a good chance\nPostgraduate Ceremonies 2006\nThe 2006 Postgraduate Awards Ceremonies\nwill be taking place on Wednesday 31 May.\nIf you are eligible to graduate, you will receive\nan invitation by post in mid February.

Lots to look\nforward to this term, most notably\nVarsity day which provides a good\nexcuse for pointless abuse of med-ics.\nJust a quick comment on the above\narticle. Felix does not condone the\nuse of guns in a so-called sporting\ncontext. Guns were not designed\nto provide amusement in the same\nway that golf clubs and squash rackets were, they were designed to\nkill. The way the pro-gun lobby are\ncurrently hijacking our successful\nOlympic bid in an attempt to overturn the ban on the private ownership of pistols under the guise of\n\u201cconcern\u201d for Great Britain\u2019s 2012\nmedal prospects in shooting events\nis shameful. These sanctimonious,\nself-appointed \u201claw abiding citizens\u201d want the ban overturned so\nthat they can resume the practice\nof their favourite past-time. They\nshould just accept that they\u2019ll need\nto find another hobby much in the\nsame way as those who were partial\nto watching a spot of cock-fighting.\nTheir warped thinking extends to a\nvariety of activities that most right-thinking people find unacceptable.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all familiar with their\nstandard reactionary whinge; \u201cThe\npolice shouldn\u2019t be there to stop a\nlaw-abiding person like me shoot-ing/speeding/driving home from the\npub half-cut. They should be out\nthere arresting burglars/moving on\ngypsies/rounding up illegal immigrants.\u201d Grows tiring, doesn\u2019t it?\nAs the author states, this was a\ntraining weekend organised by the\narmed police and served to illustrate the importance of having\nwell-trained officers working within\narmed response and does not intend\nin anyway to promote or glorify the\nuse of guns. With British landmarks\nand citizens facing new threats in\nincreasingly violent animal rights\nterrorists and disaffected young los-ers, it is vital to the national interest\nthat we have highly trained professionals to respond to violent crimi-nals. Events such as this serve an\nexcellent purpose, ensuring transparency within the force itself as\nwell as a method of obtaining new\nrecruits.\nNot just crazy kids with guns, but responsible trainees\nPlease send your sports reports, reviews and comments to\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAirsoft\nThe entire training session culminated with the final exercise where\nwe were expected to use our recent\ntraining to clear a building, totally\nnew to us, from three police officers playing the role of \u2018terrorists\u2019\nand rescue two other officers in the\nroles of \u2018hostages\u2019. After less than 15\nminutes, 8 rooms were cleared without casualty either among hostage\nsquad members.\nIt must be said that extreme safety measures were taken. Wearing\nprotective masks was mandatory\nthroughout the entire practice session while ear-muffs had to be worn\nthroughout the flash-bang grenade\ntutorials. Protective gloves were\nalso worn as hits in the fingers cause\nquite intense pain. Furthermore,\nduring hostage-terrorist scenarios\n\u201cwe were only\nallowed to fire targets\ndepicting armed people aiming at us\u201d\nshooting a non-hostile target was\nseverely penalised as ethically\nincorrect, and therefore deemed as\nfailure. We were only allowed to\nfire targets depicting armed people\naiming at us solely and exclusively.\nThat applied strictly despite the fact\nthat the leading two members of the\nsquad storming a room have only\na fraction of a second to scan the\nroom, decide whether a target is an\nimmediate threat and then pull or\nnot pull the trigger. It is important to\nknow that we are not just crazy kids\nwith guns, but responsible trainees.\n\n"

    "content": "L\nast week Felix ran an article about the\nlack of British minorities attending\nImperial. While this is a concern, I think\npeople are over-looking a much bigger\nissue. Over the past few weeks I have been more\nand more observant of the issue and have come\nto this conclusion: Imperial is prejudice against\nsocially-able students. I personally find this blatant discrimination appalling and am shocked\nany university could over look such a horrifically\ncorrupt admissions procedure.\nAn anonymous insider revealed to us that\nthe admission tutors had come together with\nthe computer science department to create a\ncomputer system which scans through UCAS\napplication forms and filters out applicants\nwhose personal statements contain any of the\nfollowing phrases: \u201cWhen I\u2019m not studying\nI enjoy\u2026\u201d, \u201cIn my spare time I like\u2026\u201d, \u201cMy\nnon-academic interests include\u2026\u201d and so on.\nA newer version of the program, version 1.04a\nbeta, is currently being developed. This will\nallow the previous phrases to be overlooked\non the condition they are followed with any of\nthe following: \u201cplaying dungeons & dragons\u201d,\n\u201cupdating my online diary\u201d or \u201cbuying more\nscience fiction novels for my collection.\u201d\nIt was also revealed that the science fiction\nclub had played a central role in these sinister\ngoings-on. A recent attempt by an undercover\noutsider to infiltrate their head quarters ended\nin catastrophe. After being sent off into the\nunknown, the young volunteer was not seen for\nweeks, until, on be spotted scurrying across the\nBeit quad, showed no sign of recognition to his\nold friends and was heard to mutter: \u201cLeave me\nalone, my epic ogre-warrior is almost a level\nthirty-two!\u201d before climbing under a rock (or\ngoing back to the science fiction room).\nI will conclude by asking you all to give a\nfew moments thought for our fallen comrade\nand leave you with this: If you seen anyone\napproaching you sporting a \u201cThere are 10 types\nof people in the word, those who understand\nbinary and those who don\u2019t\u201d, then flee for your\nlife!\nI\nn last week\u2019s Felix, Ammar Waraich set out\nhis view of the legacy of Ariel Sharon and\nwhat the future may hold for the middle\neast.\nAlthough in all a well-written article, Ammar\nfalls foul of the most common attack on Israel\nwhen he refers to \u201cthe racist nature of the\nJewish-only state\u201d. This inflammatory language\nnot only detracts from his argument, but it is\nalso wrong. Jewish-only? Israel is indeed a\nJewish state but it is far from being Jewish-only,\nwith twenty percent of Israelis being of non-Jewish (and predominantly Arab) background.\nRacist? Israel is a multicultural society, with\nfreedom of religion and all citizens treated\nequally under law. The one exception is its\nimmigration policy, which while open to all gives\nautomatic citizenship to Jews. This is brought\nabout by the exceptional circumstances of\nIsrael being the only Jewish state in the world,\nproviding a unique haven to Jews denied their\nrights elsewhere. But if you were to brand this\npolicy as racist, you would need to label almost\nall immigration policy as being bigoted - even\nthe UK\u2019 s favouring of commonwealth citizens,\nlet alone the restrictive migration laws of most\nother countries in the middle east.\nAside from that assault, the article laid out a\nwell written account of recent events and offered\nan intriguing suggestion as to the motives\nbehind Sharon\u2019s decision to leave Likud to form\nthe new Kadima party \u2013 to counter the \u201crising\npopularity\u201d of Avoda, Israel\u2019s Labour Party,\nwhich elected Amir Peretz as its leader on\nNovember 9th.\nHowever, while an interesting idea, it is rather\ndoubtful. Ever since the pull out from Gaza last\nsummer, it has been an open secret that Sharon\nwas planning to form a new party. The split in\nLikud was not mere \u201cinfighting\u201d - it was a fundamental disagreement about Sharon\u2019s unilateral\nstrategy of withdrawal.\nIt is misleading to suggest that Kadima is\nnothing more than \u201ca new Likud\u201d. While it is\nindeed dominated by former Likud members,\nKadima\u2019s support for further unilateral withdrawals is a complete upheaval of Likud\u2019s policy\nof continued rule of the occupied territories. This\nhas given the Israeli voter three distinct choices\nin the upcoming general election - continued\noccupation with Likud, a return to peace talks\nwith Labour, or further unilateral withdrawals\nwith Kadima.\nAs a supporter of peace and the formation of\na viable Palestinian state, my heart lies with\nLabour. I was very enthusiastic when Peretz\nwas elected and emphasised tackling poverty\nand improving public services. However, the\nsad fact is that after years of failed negotiations,\nmany Israelis have given up the idea of final-state peace talks. At the same time, the majority\nof Israelis do not support the continuation of\noccupation and settlements. Because of this,\nSharon\u2019s plan struck a chord with many people\nacross the political spectrum. It is now expected\nthat he will not return to politics even if he does\nrecover. But this will not mean the election of\nLabour as Ammar predicted. Kadima is anything\nbut stranded and is likely to be by far the biggest\nparty - despite Ehud Olmert only just taking over\nas its leader.\nThe reasoning behind the support of the unilateral approach is the wish of the majority of\nIsraelis to give up occupied territories towards\npeace and security, while despairing at the\nfailure of doing this through negotiation with\nthe ineffective leadership of the Palestinian\nAuthority. The international community must\nrecognise the vast ramifications this has on\nfuture peace talks. Further withdrawals from\noccupied territories should be supported, but it\nis crucial to make sure they do not prevent the\nfuture establishment of a Palestinian state or\nits viability. It is uncertain when a return to the\nnegotiation table will be made, but it is something we must continue to push towards.\nA\nn MTV-sponsored report, entitled Statistics of Trendy University\nDiscrimination (STUD), has singled\nout Imperial as having very few cool\nstudents. Officially only 12 students attending\nImperial qualified as \u201ccool\u201d with another 34 managing to score \u201chip\u201d. Concern has been raised\nover the 2 students qualifying as \u201cdangerously\nuncool\u201d. Although IC scored highly on \u201cgeek\nchic\u201d, it unfortunately scored even more highly\non just pure \u201cgeek\u201d.\nThe STUD report was a nationwide survey\ncompiled over November 2005 in which universities across the country were compared\non aspects such as trendiness and coolness. 5\nyoung officials from MTV spent time on campus\nranking the students for their coolness. They\nmeasured such things as walking style, fashion\nsense, weight of worn bling, hair style etc, to\ncome up with an overall cool percentage for the\nuniversity.\nThe coolest university in the UK was the\nInstitute of... The students there were too cool to\nagree to name their university. Courses featured\nin their prospectus include \u201cFunkology\u201d but\nunfortunately, as IC students, we were unable\nto understand the rest that were listed. They\nscored a cool rating of 98.2%. This contrasts\nsharply with Imperial College, now officially\nthe least cool university, even being beaten by\nCambridge with a score of 1.7%. It is speculated\nthat Cambridge got such an impressive score\nsolely because of their recent Hendrix Institute\nof Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll that was opened to students last\nOctober.\nAlthough Imperial is the least cool UK uni-versity, things may be about to change. The\npurpose of the MTV report was to find a worthy\nuniversity to participate in the first UK version\nof the state-side show \u201cPimp My College\u201d. The\nchanges to college will start in February and\nwill give an added boost to the planned Union\nrefurbishment. Official announcements will be\nmade over the coming weeks about the changes\nstudents should expect as the MTV crew moves\nin. The project and accompanying TV show will\nbe hosted by Michael Jackson (who\u2019ll earn a six-figure sum) and should last around 4 months.\nMost topical of all will be the new dress code.\nStudents will be required to wear as many hoods\nas they can and a minimum of 2kg of gold and\nsilver medallions. Swipe card lanyards will be\nreplaced thick gold chains and swipe cards will\nbecome diamond encrusted. While filming is in\nprogress, any student seen in shot not wearing\nthe correct attire will be removed by security.\nMore sweeping changes involve the abolition\nof the physics and maths and their replacement\nby the Brian May Institute for Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. This\nthinly veiled attempt to follow Cambridge\u2019s path\nto glory will result in the unemployment of 300\nresearchers. Those who remain will be expected\nto learn chords, riffs and showmanship. The\nElectronic Engineering department will become\nThe Exotic Entertainment department and\nGeology will be toned down to \u201cRocks for Jocks\u201d.\nA physics student, who did not want to be iden-tified, said \u201cYo dwag, I fink dem derr is excellent\nplans. Me \u2018n me bitches will be pluckin\u2019. Aai?\u201d\nPressed upon this point, he further elucidated\nthat: \u201cWell, actually. I\u2019m not terribly \u2018cool\u2019 as\nthey say, but I\u2019m trying to go with the flow. You\nknow?\u201d. A female medic proclaimed: \u201cI\u2019m really\ncool. Last night I ginned 3 of my friends. Aaaii?\u201d\nAs we walked away, she proceeded to chug a little gin bottle.\nThe Mayor of College has agreed to lead by\nexample and wear a huge white fur coat, a diamond cane and grow a goatee. He has given his\ngo-ahead for the painting of go-faster stripes\ndown the side of Sherfield as well as begrudgingly agreeing to allow the pimping of the logo\nfrom Arial font to Times New Roman.\nThe Brown Couch team has also reached\nagreement with MTV about transforming the\nJCR.

NTL chief executive,\nSimon Duffy, approached Brandson\n10 months ago and clandestine talks\ncontinued between the two sides.\nThis culminated in a discussion with\nT-Mobile, the German group, which\ncarries calls for Virgin Mobile on\nits network. Completion is dependent on the current merger between\nNTL and Telewest. Ultimately, success will form the UK\u2019s first business offering a package of mobile,\nfixed line and television services.\nThe deal proposes a swap\nMichael Olymbios\nstand-off with Iran over its nuclear\nprogramme. Iran provides over 5\nper cent of global oil production,\nand with Saudi Arabia and the rest\nof OPEC pumping at full capacity already, they will be unable to\ncompensate for any shortfall in oil\nsupplies as they did during the Iraq\nwar. The global economy has coped\nwith $70 per barrel oil, but at the\n$100 per barrel likely if Iranian oil\nexports halt, the global economy\nwould suffer.\nA bird-flu pandemic would spell\ndisaster for the global economy.\nEconomies would plunge into reces-sion, and investors would sell bonds\nand shares and move to the safety of\ngold, cash and property.\nFor Britain however, the prospects\nare less rosy. The economy had been\ndoing a lot better than the Eurozone, but economic growth fell to\nThe City - Conglomerate mergers\njust over 2 per cent. Many economists blame red-tape and high taxes\nthat are transforming the UK economy into a European-style economy.\nChristmas brought little cheer for\nmany retailers \u2013 still suffering from\nthe high-street recession \u2013 and there\nhave been a record number of profit\nwarnings issued by companies from\nall industry segments.\nIn the last week of December, the\n\u201cyield curve\u201d inverted, meaning that\ninstead of being more expensive for\na government to borrow for 10 years\nthan it was for 2 years. The significance of the inversion is that over\nthe past seventy years there have\nbeen seven recessions, all of which\nhave been preceded by an inversion of the yield curve. This may be\nexplained by the Federal Reserve\u2019s\npolicy of increasing interest rates,\nbut put into context with the recent\nrally in the price of gold (a safe\nhaven during recessions) the global\neconomy may be signalling weaknesses under the surface.\nThe final clouds on the horizon are\nthe trade imbalances, namely the\nUS trade and budget deficits, and\nwhich are the highest in US history.\nOil exporting countries along with\nChina and other SE Asian countries have been buying dollars to\nkeep their currencies low, and their\nexports cheap in the US, but if they\nwere to diversify away from dollars,\nthe imbalances would be unwound,\nand are likely to do so abruptly and\npainfully.\nBut look on the bright side, if there\nwere a major hick-up in the global economy, there would be some\ninteresting fall-out. As Warren\nBuffet once said, \u201cits only when the\ntide goes out that you can see who\u2019s\nswimming naked\u201d.\n5\nfelix\nThursday 19 January 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nMichael Olymbios\nAcademics view the corporate\nmerger as a fulfilment of the economies of scale theory that stipulates\nfree markets tend towards having\nas few companies and brand names\nas possible. In summary, the theory\nargues that by merging and growing\ninto large multinationals, companies\u2019 production costs are reduced\nfor a number of reasons. On a simplistic level, this is due to decreased\nproduction costs permitted from\nbulk buying for example. You may\nthen question the justification and\nmotivation for corporations in different lines of business merging.\nInitially, it would be appropriate to\nbriefly classify mergers. There are\nfundamentally three kinds: the ver-tical, horizontal and conglomerate\nmergers. The horizontal kind is the\nmost simplistic and combines two\ncompanies in the same line of busi-ness, an example being Vodafone\u2019s\nacquisition of German telecommunications giant Mannesmann. The\nvertical variety involves companies\nat different stages of production.\nThe buyer either expands the company back towards the source of raw\nmaterials, or forwards in the direction of the consumer. For example,\nWalt Disney acquired the ABC television network with the intention\nof airing recent production to large\naudiences.\nTheconglomeratemergerinvolves\ncompanies in unrelated fields joining\nforces. This variety was particularly\npopular in the 1960s and 1970s, the\njustification being costs might be\ncut by sharing central services such\nas accounting. In reality, unrelated\ncompanies have struggled to cope\nunder the same corporate-manage-ment umbrella and much of the corporate banking action in the 1980s\npertained to the break up of the\nconglomerates formed in the previous two decades.\nNevertheless, corporations are\nunder the influence of shareholders and top-management executives leading to dubious motives for\nmergers. Brandson\u2019s quest to form\na communications giant could be\nviewed as analogous to the formation of AOL Time Warner in 2000.\nThis conglomerate made corporate\nhistory with a record-breaking $156\nbillion worth of stock purchased by\nAOL to acquire Time Warner. The\nnew company promised to fulfil the\nconsumer\u2019s media and information\nneeds. Unfortunately profits in the\ncompany slumped resulting in an\n80% decline in the share value.\nIn the next issue, we shall examine the merger in more detail such\nas the mechanics and technicalities\nof the merger.\nbetween Brandson\u2019s 72% stake in\nVirgin Mobile for 14% in the newly\nformed giant that is intended to\nbe rebranded Virgin. Thus far an\nNTL offer has been rejected by\nVirgin Mobile minority share hold-ers, valuing the company at \u00a3817m.\nBrandson appeared on The Today\nProgramme, citing a \u00a325m gap in\nthe value of the company. A rebuttal was issued to the UK Takeover\nPanel for fear of the company\u2019s corporate governance being brought\ninto question.\nSubsequently, NTL raised\nthe terms of its offer this Friday\nto \u00a3930m.. To realise the merger,\nBrandson is willing to reach into\nhis own pocket, bridging the gap\nbetween what minority shareholders demand and the price NTL wishes to pay. At a cost of \u00a39m.\n\n"

This is without doubt a song\nto go absolutely nuts to; an eclectic\nmix of frantic guitar chords accompanied with the deepthroaty yell of\nBjorn Dixgard and a crazily catchy\nchorus makes forawesome light\nrock which will most definitely get\nyou up and dancing,screaming \u201c...\ndown in the PAST!\u201d at the top of\nyour voice.\nProphesised to become as big\nas Oasis, this manically energetic\nbandcomprising of Gustav Noren,\nCarl-Johan Fogelklou, Samuel\nGiers, Mats Bjorke and Dixgard\noriginates from the town of Borlange\nin Sweden,forming at the tender age\nof sixteen in a desperate attempt,\nso Noren claims, to escape the high\ndrug and murder rate. Through\nyears of dedication to their music\n(thank God!) and with their gritty\nbackground they have provided us\nwith two almost certainly amazing albums, the current being\nHurricane Bar, released in 2005 and\nfrom which this track is taken. After\nrecently supporting The Bravery in\nconcert, Mando Diao stepped into\nthe limelight to headline their own\nacclaimed tour in October 2005.\nA seemingly little known wonder,\nI am shocked that I know and have\nheard so little about them. Go and\nbuy Hurricane Bar now! Their last\ntour tickets were at a maximum of\n\u00a38 - a drink and rocking tunes all for\na tenner? It hardly seems fair with\na quality of music this brilliant: we\nhave to get this band known! Forget\nThe Hives. Mando Diao should now\nbe the band blasting their Swedish\nsounds in your ears.

It\u2019s not your standard\nsong material either. The song, as\nfar as I can tell, is a compassionate look at the story of young girls\nforced into prostitution for one reason or another, and the scum-of-the-earth (hence \u201cScummy\u201d) pimps who\ndrive them. The song begins with\na single guitar strumming the odd\nchord and sorrowful vocals on top\nintroducing the character of the girl\nand the scummy man: \u201c...I said he\u2019s\na scumbag, don\u2019t you know?\u201d And\nthen there is a full-blown cymbal\ncrash as the rest of the instruments\ncome in, building slowly up and up,\nand at the climax seamlessly falling\ninto the main riff, which, in all of\nits bassy glory, is one of the coolest\nI\u2019ve heard in a while. The drums,\nas in previous songs (most notably\nBet You Look Good\u2026), are fabulous,\nwith more funky rolls and fills than\nyou can shake a stick at, and give the\nsong a real sense of pace. The lyrics\nare well thought out and convey\na very clear picture, although the\nsong is in fact quite short and ends\nabruptly. All instruments suddenly\nstop save the guitar, which goes\non to play the intro once again and\nfinishing with a lovely, very befitting\nseries of plinky chords.\nAll-in-all, the single is a unique and\nfantastic song. Whether we\u2019ll hear it\nbeing used on dancefloors remains\nto be seen, but I think that is where\nit\u2019s full glory would be finally real-ised.\nPriya G\nSingles club\nShock horror as very long byline precedes page with only two singles on it, due to the massive\nadvert below; stay tuned for further boring updates\nmusic music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 19 January 2005\nMando Diao\nDown In The Past\n(EMI)\nHHHHI\nArctic Monkeys\nWhen The Sun Goes Down\n(Domino)\nHHHHH\nEditorial\nWe\u2019re back!

However, as\nI\u2019m The Hoff, I\u2019m going to generalise,\nbecause hey, I\u2019m David Hasselhoff\nand I don\u2019t play by nobodies rules.\n\u201cIt can be hard to\nconcentrate when\nyou\u2019re surrounded by\nso much minge\u201d\n\u201cTake comfort in the\ncold, metallic taste of\ntheir clit ring\u201d\nComplaints, Questions, Feedback to coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPlay your cards right, and this could be you\nwhat more could you want?\nEmo / Goth / Indie Girls\n+ (Sometimes) Good Music Taste,\n\u2018Interesting\u2019 Dress Sense\n- Mars Volta, Taking Back Sunday,\nOther Emo crap\nCan be found drinking Cider, not\ndancing\nShould you be that way inclined, a\nnice Rocker chick can be a lot of fun.\nUnfortunately, you\u2019ll have to put up\nwith the occasional 20-minute experimental Latin/Grindcore Fusion\ndrum solo.

The\nnext step is to somehow persuade\nher to get into bed with you - This\ncan be hard, especially if you\u2019re\nlooking particularly Imperial that\nday. The trick is to convince her\nto see behind the acne, smell and\ngeneral creepy aura you project,\nand to see the inner, beautiful per-son.

Are\nthere pants on the floor? Is there\nan empty condom packet on the\nbedside table? Is there a girlfriend\nalready in your bed? If you\u2019re not\nsmart enough to deal with these\nthings beforehand, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be at Imperial. Lock\nher in the toilet, clean your room,\nand let her out, declaring \u2018The lock\u2019s\na little stiff sometimes\u2019. Emphasise\n\u2018stiff\u2019.

    "content": "LIVE REVIEWS\nOriginating in Switzerland, The\nYoung Gods have survived an almost\ncomplete turnover of members with\nthe exception of the band found-er, Franz Treichler; by the early\nnineties they had achieved critical\nacclaim and commercial success.\nThe Young Gods have gone against\nthe conventional rules of music,\nreplacing the commonplace guitar\nwith a sampler to introduce a new\nelectronic dimension to live music.\nThe Swiss trio refuse to be categorised by embracing all music\nfrom classical to punk, obscuring\nand fusing these opposing sounds\nwith such genius that although it\nshouldn\u2019t work, it does. Before last\nSaturday we were unfamiliar with\nthis band, but trusting the opinion of\na good friend, decided to check out\nwhat The Young Gods are all about.\nOn arrival, the venue was pretty empty, but at 9.15pm the band\nappeared on stage to a hoard of\nscreaming fans with barely enough\nspace to lift a pint. Their performance began as it was meant to, with\ncatchy up-beat tempos and under-tones, expertly exploiting the sampler to loop and layer diverse riffs\nto achieve a gradual crescendo from\nmellow to manic. With the contribution of strong beats by the drummer,\nand Franz playing his vocals like\nan instrument \u2013 sometimes sooth-ing, sometimes screaming \u2013 the ultimate outcome was that of a rich\nand varied performance. The feel\nof the night was slightly techno,\nslightly rock, and fantastically edgy,\ncombined with an atmosphere brimming with energy, both on stage\nand in the audience. The Young\nGods expressed themselves not\nonly through their music, but took\nfull advantage of dramatic lighting to set a dark, almost hypnotic\nmood, interjected by sudden bursts\nof energy to keep the audience on\ntheir toes. Gig-goers were treated to\nan hour long set including numerous classics such as the brilliant\nSkinflower and Supersonic, along\nwith new songs to whip the audience\ninto a frenzy and firmly establish an\nenergetic mosh-pit.\nWith the melodramatic use of\nlight and sound, and their fervent\npassion, the band really do provide\na show worth experiencing in the\nflesh. If you closed your eyes, you\u2019d\nbe forgiven for believing an entire\norchestra was performing. While\nthe whole futuristic feel may not\nbe to everybody\u2019s taste, The Young\nGods prove that there is more to\nmusic than simply adding lyrics to a\nmelody.\nLucy Riches\nTom Rowlands and Ed Simons, aka\nThe Chemical Brothers, are the pioneers of Big Beat - reaching the\nlevels of the infamous Fatboy Slim\nand Death In Vegas. Yes, these are\nbig names, so shut up and put down\nyour panini.\nThe Chemical Brothers took deliberately artificial, robotic and repetitious drumbeats and added rock-style drum lines with individually\nsampled loops. For the less musically astute, they created a deadly duo\nof dance and guitar rock with the\nenergy to fill stadiums from Tokyo\nto Chile and so became\u2026. Super\nStar DJs.\nBeing the dedicated reviewer that\nI am, I decided to skip the Friday\nnight slut fest at Crush, smoke a\nlot of hash and head to Brixton to\nsee what they were all about. Being\nin no state to tell the time or read\na tube map and dragging along a\nplus one that can\u2019t do either on a\ngood day, I end up bizarrely being\na little early. This gave us plenty\nof time to stand in the cold and\nchat to some rather pilled-up short\nEuropeans and as far as I could tell\na Northerner, as he spoke funny and\ncouldn\u2019t quite grasp the concept of\nmeaningful conversation (I\u2019m north-ern, you southern pansy \u2013 ed.).\nSuddenly the sadistic doorman\nreceived his mystic cue and opened\nthe doors. All immediate friendships\nwere forgotten, girlfriends were discarded and it was every man for\nhimself. I ruthlessly made my way\nto the stalls, which are by far the\nbest seats in the house - not because\nyou\u2019re actually allowed to stand and\ndance but because there are four\nbars in one room. God bless this\nnation of drunken rabble.\nAny Chemical Brothers album\nis always a journey through mesmerizing guitar riffs, block rockin\u2019\nbeats, wicked samples and huge\nbreakdowns. Tonight clearly wasn\u2019t\ngoing to be an exception. DJ James\nHolroyd had the honour of opening up and provided a backdrop of\nearly, simplistic house and techno\nthat spawned the new generation\nof energetic DJs that rocked the\nhouse into an ecstatic state of pure\neuphoria.\nCaged Baby took to the stage\ndonning tight leather in true camp\nglam-rock style. Playing live and\nproviding deep, guitar-lead techno\nthat would put a smile on Frankie\nKnuckles\u2019 face.\nA host of lush melodies and softer\ndance grooves fell on eager ears as\nanticipation of the chemical gods\ngrew to immense hysteria. All fell\nquiet as psychedelic laser beams\nfilled the academy. A silent whisper\nran across the floor. The Chemical\nBrothers had arrived.\nThe intro was bass-heavy and a\nlittle rugged but it will be interesting to see how it develops into\nan album track. Digging into their\nback catalogue, Hey Boy Hey Girl\nexploded into the smoky atmos-phere. Stunning visuals in sync with\nthe music projected over the throng\nof heads, exploding bubbles, scary\nclowns, marching robots and other\ntrippy shit.\nChart topping tracks from Push\nThe Button, Dig Your Own Hole\nand Exit Planet Dust featured\nheavily across the set while periodically dropping into their deeper,\nnon-released and more expressive\nworks.\nThe mighty Dust Brothers had\nemotional control of five thousand\npeople, turning them into one\nimmense euphoric flow of energy,\nmanipulating the mood of the crowd\nand using them as an instrument\nwithin itself. This is what they are\nfamed for. They truly are the masters of the arena-sized sound.\nGeorge X\nClad in pink lycra catsuits and with\n\u2018Halagoogoo\u2019 emblazoned across\ntheir stomachs, please welcome\nthe warm up act for tonights gig.\nTo chants of \u2018Hal-a-goo-goo, Hala-goo-goo\u2019, the band pumped out\na range of upbeat funky tunes and\nwholeheartedly entered into the\nChristmas spirit, with their glitter\nadorned faces and tossing crackers\ninto the crowd. With their enthusiasm and catchy tunes, these guys\nare bound to become a well known\nname on the London circuit.\nCome 10.15 and Milk Kan make\na modest entrance; it is evident by\ntheir casual dress and manner that\nthese guys are not buying into the\nwhole \u2018product\u2019 ethos of the music\nindustry. With the crowd warmed\nup, they wasted no time with small\ntalk during their set, and allowed\ntheir unadulterated rawness to\nspeak volumes. Milk Kan provide\na wonderfully weird blend of satirical poetry, part-sung, part-recited to\nsimple tunes. The journey of aspiring to fame has seen these cheeky\nchaps jet off from South London to\nNew York and back again, along the\nway recruiting further band members to generate Milk Kan as we see\nthem today. Named after the famous\nHoudini milk can escape, they are\nperhaps implying that all in life is\nnot quite as it seems, and ultimately\ngive a refreshing uncensored take\non modern ways. Noone is safe\nfrom the wrath of Milk Kan\u2019s wicked\nwit, yet they somehow get away\nwith it, using their cheeky appeal\nto go places others wouldn\u2019t dare.\nObvious comparisons to be made\nare that of Milk Kan to the Streets,\ncombined with the down-to-earth\nappeal of GLC and somewhere deep\ndown I am sure I felt the influence\nof Blur. Make what you will of them,\nyou have to give Milk Kan credit for\ntheir fantastically deadpan attitude\ntowards the music industry. Forget\nthe wishy-washy lyrics favoured\nby many bands today: these guys\nwaste no time on menial subjects\nsuch as love. Instead, their lyrics\nare completely bizarre, though if\nyou listen carefully you may begin\nto understand what was possibly\nnot intended to be understood in the\nfirst place.\nIt truly was a shame that the audience was not larger; though the boys\nappeared not to care, and despite,\nas we were later informed, the set\nbeing plagued by technical hitches,\nthis went unnoticed by the crowd\nand the set flowed smoothly. With\ntheir hilarious lyrics and catchy\ntunes they definitely deserve more\nappreciation. I can picture a room\njam packed with bouncing revellers;\nif you are after that happy-go lucky,\nfeel good factor then Milk Kan are\nthe guys for you.\nLucy Riches\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSwitzerland rocks!\nThe Young Gods impress and the Chemical Brothers blow minds with their live shows\nThe Chemical Brothers - knob-twiddlers.\nThe Young Gods - Best.

T: 020 7594 8060 www.union.imperial.ac.uk\nUnion\nUnion Building Redevelopment\nWith the plans for the Union Building redevelopment progressing, a number of you have asked about the Energy Efficiency options that have been looked into\nand that will be incorporated into the redeveloped building. Whilst not everything that we\u2019d ideally want can be incorporated, due to structural reasons, costs,\nplanning permission (we are in South Ken after all), various areas have already been looked into and are continuing to be investigated.\nCollege will be taking an Energy Audit of the proposed redevelopment and will make recommendations to be incorporated into the building plans to improve\nenergy efficiency e.g. better carbon management. But for now, below is a summary of what\u2019s been investigated so far.\nSameena Misbahuddin\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nEnergy Efficency\nWater Efficency Metering of the water consumption will be introduced to the building and will help in monitoring it, allowing for reductions in usage. Direct\nmains toilet flushing will also be used instead of cisterns to reduce water consumption. We\u2019ll be working with College\u2019s Framework Energy Working Group who\naddress the issue of water conservation in new building and refurbishment projects on campus.\nHeating Efficency There\u2019ll be a good level of heating monitoring and control with thermostatic radiator valves being fitted and central climate control where\npossible, to prevent over-heating in rooms or heating at times when areas aren\u2019t occupied.\nElectrical Efficency The engineers will be investigating the monitoring of electrical energy consumption, through metering, to reduce the usage. Currently\nCollege Estates are assessing the impact that redevelopment will have on energy usage.\nLighting Efficency An energy efficient lighting solution will be developed for all areas of the building to suit the activity of each space. Types and sizes of\nlamps will be standardised, energy efficient long life lamps will be used throughout as well as dimmable controllers. The lighting control system proposed will\ninclude presence sensors and daylight sensors to control the electrical light output. Using natural light as much as possible will be key in the building.\nCarbon Efficency We\u2019re working with College\u2019s Energy & Environmental Manager in improving carbon efficiency and using low carbon technologies where\npossible in the Union Building.\nRenewable energy options that were investigated initially included, Wind Generation, Photovoltaic (PVs) and Solar Water Heating. These could all be suitable for\n50% funding from various grants. These are not currently being included, but College investigating them further. However, though 50% funding could be sought,\nfunding for the other 50% would significantly increase the cost of the overall\nbuilding project, sometimes not bringing the equivalent benefit. If there was a way to gain full sponsorship or more funding for these aspects, then we\u2018d be keen\nto revisit these options\u2026\nMore Feedback\nThank you for those who have emailed already. If any of you have specific energy efficiency ideas, let us know and then we can see if they\u2019ve already been\naddressed (and what the result was) or investigate the feasibility of the new idea. If any of you know possible companies that would be interested in fully\nsponsoring energy efficient technology then let us know and we can pursue it together....\nMany years ago, in a union far, far away...enough for a\ndramatic beginning?\nIn case you are wondering who I am, let me introduce myself,\nI am Sid, the President of the City & Guilds College Union,\nthe student\u2019s union for the Engineering students.

It\nwas alarming to think that anyone\ncould just walk around our halls\nunnoticed, stealing things.\u201d\nThe Committee also raised concerns regarding the permitted\naccess of unsupervised workmen\nto the halls within Evelyn Gardens,\nparticularly as many of the items\nhad been stolen from locked rooms.\nThis has led to some speculation\namongst residents that a temporary\ncleaner may have been to blame for\nthe wave of burglaries. However,\nsuch claims are unsubstantiated and\nhave been widely dismissed by the\nmajority of residents questioned, \u201cI\nhave heard nothing of a temporary\ncleaner being responsible for any\nthefts. My cleaner is very friendly\nand often quite helpful,\u201d responded\nRichard Arkless, \u201cthe thefts that\noccurred at the start of last term\nwere down to a professional thief\nwho knows how to target halls and\ntook advantage of the freshers not\nknowing better.\u201d\nWhilst it seems highly unlikely\nthat employed staff are involved in\nthe recent thefts at Evelyn Gardens,\nparticularly given the fact that the\nthief hasbeen recorded on CCTV and\ncannot be identified, such in-house\ncrimes are not unknown. Earlier\nthis month Ian Bartlett, a warden\nat Oxford University, received a\nfive-year sentence after pleading\nguilty to a total of 115 counts of\nburglary taking place in 18 college\nhalls. Bartlett, it emerged, had been\nemployed as a care-taker despite\n\u201cprevious spent convictions\u201d.\nA spokesperson for Oxford\nUniversity blamed \u201cexisting legislation\u201d preventing \u201crefusal of employ-Cash & laptops stolen\nment on these grounds.\u201d Such\nstatements led Felix to query the\nsafeguards met by Imperial College\nwhen employing staff and to further\nquestion whether there had been\nany staff dismissals due to thefts in\nthe past.\nNick Roalfe, Assistant Director\nof Estates, dismissed claims that\nthefts at Evelyn Gardens were carried out by a temporary cleaner\nciting \u201cCCTV evidence which suggests that the suspects are not\nstudent/staff related\u201d. Mr. Roalfe\nurged students with any evidence\nto the contrary to \u201creport suspicions immediately to the security\ndepartment at the earliest convenience.\u201d Mr. Roalfe could not confirm\nor deny past theft-related dismissals although commented that \u201cno\nrecords suggest this has been the\ncase.\u201d\nFelix queried the vetting procedures used to employ staff, and\nCollege assured us that Extracalm,\nthe agency through which cleaning\nstaff are employed, \u201cundertakes the\nsame level of vetting as is applied\nby the College for general staff.\u201d\nThe College security department\nalso monitors \u201ckeys and access controls.\u201d Overall, we were assured that\nthe security of students and staff\nwas taken very seriously and the\ndepartment remained \u201cextremely\npro active regarding safety and\nsecurity, constantly looking at ways\nto improve on this.\u201d\nDr. Martin Jackson, the Warden\u2019s\nrepresentative for security issues\nat Bernard Sunley Hall, feels that\nsecurity risks at Evelyn Gardens\nhave been exaggerated. He told\nFelix that \u201cthe frequency of incidents is no different to those reported in Prince\u2019s Gardens or the outer\nlying halls.\u201d The outlandish thefts\nin Evelyn Gardens contrast significantly with other halls, which have\nreported only a few minor instances\ninvolving the \u201cstealing of food and\ncutlery from kitchens\u201d.\nThe installation of safes at\nBernard Sunley Hall suggests that\nthere is a specific problem in Evelyn\nGardens. The College security\ndepartment denies that Imperial\nhas acted in response to known\nthreats, stating: \u201cThe reason that\nhotel-type safes have been installed\nin Bernard Sunley Hall is purely\na crime prevention exercise, acting on advice from Kensington and\nChelsea Police.\u201d Safes have been\npiloted in this particular building, as\nDr. Jackson explains, \u201csimply due\nto the halls relatively small size (84\nbeds)\u201d making it the obvious hall in\nwhich to carry out a trial.\nThe pilot scheme has so far\nreceived a mixed response. Whilst\nmany are pleased with the added\nsecurity, others, such as Arkless,\nare wary of the costs involved,\n\u201cPersonally I wouldn\u2019t want to pay\nextra for having a safe in my room.\nHall fees are already extremely high\nand they don\u2019t need excuses to make\nthem any higher.\u201d Earlier this year,\nSouthwell Hall Committee opted\nagainst the measure after it was\ndecided that, as well as increasing\nroom prices significantly, the safes\nwould be fairly easy to remove and\nwould also let thieves know precisely where valuables were located.\nA decision (largely dependent on\nstudent feedback) will be made later\nthis year on whether to install safes\nthroughout other halls in college.\nBernard Sunley Hall, where safes have been fitted in every room to combat a series of thefts in Evelyn Gardens. If the trial proves successful, it will be extended to all halls.

The initial phase will start in the\nsummer, after term ends, and will\ninclude the transfer of books from\nthe Science Museum collection.\nJenkins told us that \u201cthe building has not been upgraded since it\nwas first built\u2026 I am pleased that\nwe have a commitment to fund the\nrenovation.\u201d The reconstruction will\nbe \u201cmore suited to a larger student\npopulation and will have better zoning for quiet and group study.\u201d\nWhile the exact details of the\nworks are still being finalised, a\nsummary of the proposal shows that\nboth levels four and five will be\nrenovated. Particular efforts will be\nmade to improve ventilation on level\nfour by introducing air conditioning\nand level five will become a specialist area for the humanities. In turn,\nthe business department will move\ndown to level two.\nLibrary redevelopment\nContinued from page 1\nContinued from page 1 Work in these areas will be\nrestricted to times when many students will not require access to the\ncollections, such as during the summer holidays. College is presently\nlooking at options for an alternative\nstudy space so students wishing to\nstudy during the holidays will not be\ndisturbed by building works.\nAs reported in Felix last week,\nthe redevelopment plans include the\nrelocation of infrequently used items\nfrom the Science Museum collection\nas the Museum has \u201cfound itself\nunable to afford the library configuration\u201d. The Rare Book Collection\nwill move to the Science Museum\nBuildings at South Kensington,\nwhilst other materials will be moved\nto buildings in Wroughton, Wiltshire.\nHowever, all material not in the\nCentral Library will be available\nthrough a twenty-four hour call back\nservice, accessed online, by phone\nor through the library. These plans\nwill help provide more study space\nwithin the library.\nThe proposal drawn up by the\nScience Museum regarding its\nrelocation also requires \u201cappropriate public access to electronically\nstored information.\u201d Ceri Davies,\nHead of Security, assured Felix\nthat \u201cthis would make no difference\nwhatsoever to security. The library\nalready has a booking-in system\nfor members of the public. Security\nin the library is provided by the\nScience Museum and is not part of\nthe College\u2019s security services.\u201d\nStudent response to the proposed\nplans seems quite positive, although\nthe closure of departmental libraries last year was met with protests.\nThe estimated date for the completion of the works is, as yet, unknown,\nbut the library staff hopes that the\nredevelopment will be finished by\n2008.\nThe library will be open 24 hours again despite complaints last year of\nstudents \u2018moving into\u2019 the library and brushing their teeth in the toi-lets.

    "content": "sport\nNo surrender!\nQuick Crossword by Fishface\nCrossword\nsetters\nrequired!\nfelix@ic.ac.uk\nEvery now and then we are reminded of the greatness of Sport, of the\nway it creates and moulds character and of the way it can bring\na collection of individuals together\nand create something spectacular.\nEveryone present at Berrylands\nSports Ground last Wednesday saw\na true example of this. Coming into\nthis match with their sights firmly\nfixed on promotion as well as the\ntop position in their BUSA league,\nthe IC 2nds knew a difficult match\nawaited them, due to the reverse\nfixture having been a tense encounter that had resulted in a narrow 2-1\nvictory.\nLSE settled first, however, and\nbegan to start passing the ball\naround, exerting some pressure on\nthe IC defence. They won several\ncorners and a cross from one of\nthese was (allegedly) handled in the\npenalty area by IC\u2019s centre-back,\nSami, resulting in a penalty that\nwas duly converted. The first goal\nreally took the wind out of IC\u2019s sails\nand the home team began passing\nthe ball about with ease as Imperial\nstruggled to gain control of the ball\nfor any significant length of time.\nFollowing an IC attack, with most\nof the team out of position, a long\nball down the right wing gave LSE\u2019s\nstriker a run at goal, with Sami\nin close attention. As the attacker\nshot from inside the box the ball\ndeflected off Sami\u2019s leg, over the\nunfortunate James Haugh and into\nthe goal.\nLSE really began to dominate\nat this point, (Masters would have\nbeen proud) punishing (steady\nMasters) Imperial\u2019s midfield\u2019s inability to string passes together, by\nspreading the ball to their wingers\nand playing direct football. When\nRichie P attempted a risky square\nball in midfield it was intercepted and the winger ran halfway up\nthe pitch unchallenged and slotted\nthe ball into the bottom corner. IC\nwere looking dead and buried at\nthis point, lacking any imagination\ngoing forwards and appearing shaky\nat the back. They were lucky not to\nconcede another as a header was\ncleared off the line by Leon just\nbefore half-time.\nAt 3-0 down at half-time it would\nhave been easy to simply give up,\nbut the true character of the side\nemerged as the 2nd half began. In\ncrisis situations like this teams rely\nnot only on grit and determination\nbut also individual brilliance and\nthis was provided, not for the final\ntime in the match, by MOM Chris\nParrott, Directly from kick-off Chris\nran past two LSE players before\nhitting an awesome left-footed drive\nfrom twenty five yards directly into\nthe bottom corner. This display of\nfootballing genius stunned the home\nside and gave the IC team the belief\nthat they could take something\nfrom the match. They began playing excellent football, running for\neach other and working as a unit to\nclose down their opponents as soon\nas the ball was lost. Every player in\nthe team raised their game and the\nmatch had performed an about-turn.\nChris Parrot was causing havoc for\nthe LSE side every time he touched\nthe ball and he was being well supported by the Gas Man.\nIC were rewarded for all their pressure when after around 60 minutes,\nPricey clipped a lovely ball over the\ntop for Parrott, who squared the ball\nfor AK who hit a cracking shot off\nthe post from the edge of the area.\nAK made some changes at this\npoint, swapping Leon for a waxwork\nfigure of CP\n, as LSE were now terrified of going anywhere near him (or\nwas it his twin brother Graeme?)\nand Gas Man for Robert Pires,\nwho\u2019d been kept on the bench as a\nsecret weapon. They both immediately looked effective, with Graeme\nParrott almost setting up his brother with a lovely cross from the right\nwing, forcing a great save of the\ngoalkeeper from close range. The\npressure continued to mount, the\nfruit of which came to bear after IC\nwon a corner on their right wing.\nPricey whipped in a corner to\nthe edge of the penalty area where\nRichie P leapt above the defence to\nscore a bullet header which hit the\ncrossbar and went in. Or rather he\nscrambled it in from one yard using\nhis hip, although the LSE contingent felt rather strongly that the ball\nhad not crossed the line. Bearing\nin mind the fact that it hadn\u2019t, it\u2019s\neasy to sympathise with the players\nwho were cautioned in the rush to\nimplore the referee to reconsider\nhis decision.\nNo matter, IC scented blood and\nwith twenty minutes to go they set\nabout the deflated home team like\na pack of hounds and were causing problems all over the field. CP\nslipped Pires through but he was\nunable to beat the keeper. By now\nthe LSE team were hanging on, hoping to salvage something from the\ngame and were sitting back inviting\npressure on themselves.\nGP won a free kick on the right\nwing and it was whipped in by\nPricey, onto the head of Milad who\nsaw his header hit the bar and fall to\nthe head of Pires who, with the goal\ngaping and the \u2018keeper nowhere,\nunselfishly decided to head the ball\nback off the crossbar and give GP\nthe goal instead.\nHe obliged and the IC team found\nthemselves ahead for the first time.\nRather than sit on the lead they continued to press forward and create\nchances, with Pricey being unlucky\nto head over the bar in the closing\nseconds.\nThe final whistle sparked scenes\nof jubilation and allowed the 2nds to\nbask in the knowledge that they had\npulled of one of the most memorable\nresults in history. They had shown\nheart and courage in the face of\nadversity and may that be a lesson\nto all sports teams. Never give up\nchasing down seemingly lost caus-es, never stop applying yourselves\neven when the easy option would be\nto lie down and accept defeat.\nMen\u2019s Football\nImperial College 2nd XI 4\nLSE 2nd XI 3\nRichard Parasam\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n1 2 3 4 5\n8\n6 7\n8 9 10 11\n12 13\n16 14 18\n15 16 17\n18 19 20\n24\n21\nAcross\n1.

Whale sharks,\nthe world\u2019s largest fish, are\ncaught for food in some east\nAsian countries and Australian\nresearchers suspect this is\ncausing a decline.\nThe fish is listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d, and one of the authors of\nthe new study has described the\nnew finding as \u201ca very worrying sign\u201d. The data comes from\necotourism companies which\nrun expeditions to watch whale\nsharks and swim with them in\nNingaloo Marine Park off the\nnorth-west coast. bbcNews\nMutations protects from AIDS\nA genetic mutation that protects people from AIDS may\nmake them more susceptible to the West Nile virus,\nUS researchers reported on\nTuesday.

The mutation causes people to have blood cells lacking a\nreceptor. Reuters\nAlex Antonov\nTake three comics, two scientists\nand a group of slightly unnerved\npunters reaching for their wine\nglasses and you\u2019ve got The Humour\nBehind the Headlines at the Dana\nCentre: a quiz-based evening looking back at the science stories of\n2005.\nSlime mould beetles named after\nimportant members of the Bush\nadministration; Snuppy the disgraced cloned puppy; the threat of\nglobal warming and the fact that\npoets get more sex than people of\nother professions \u2013 but also have a\nhigher incidence of schizophrenia\n\u2013 are just some of the topics discussed at tonight\u2019s science comedy\nevening at the Dana Centre.\nTwo teams made up of one comic\nand one scientist compete to show\nwho knows the most about the science headlines of 2005. Rufus Hound\ncompetes professionally in a battle of both knowledge and wit that\nclosely resembles a Have I Got\nNews For You for science. He has a\njob on his hands: chivvying rambling\nLook who\u2019s laughing now\nOur critic on the new science-based comedy show at the Dana\nKath Nightingale\nComedian Rufus Hound\nally laughing uproariously like an\nembarrassed uncle at a family meal\ntrying to cover the silence. There\u2019s\na sense of getting the fun comedy\nbit over with before getting down\nto the hard facts. The fact that all\nthe questions are answered correctly does not go unnoticed. \u2018What\u2019s\nGeorge Bush been searching for\non the moon recently?\u2019 \u2018Erm, his\nbrain?\u2019 \u2018Weapons of mass destruction?\u2019 \u2018Cheese\u2019 \u2018Certain minerals\nwhich could provide gases such as\nhydrogen and helium to use as fuel\nfor astronauts?\u2019 \u2018Correct!\u2019 It couldn\u2019t\nhave been more obvious if each contestant had a small boy whispering\nthe answers into their ear.\nPossibly the most disappointing aspect of the evening is the\nconforming to stereotype. When\nasked to talk for a minute about\nher research in the \u2018expert round\u2019,\nembryologist Virginia Bolton talks\nfor more than a minute about the\npossibility of growing organs from\nhuman stem cells as if she\u2019s at a\nconference. Rufus Hound listens,\nseemingly fascinated, as she speaks\nof blastomeres, inner cell masses\nand totipotency as if he\u2019s watching\nsomeone speak a foreign language.\nPaul Foot\u2019s minute is taken up by a\ncharming tale of his grandmother\u2019s\nmove into knitting jumpers for the\npornography industry, which while\ngenuinely funny (in my opinion at\nleast) is met with only mild chuckling from the crowd. Why can\u2019t a\nscientist say something funny and a\ncomic something which makes a bit\nmore sense?\nI really love the premise of the\nDana Centre. It has grabbed the\nchallenge of public engagement\nwith science and run with it, taking\nin theatre, comedy and well, alcohol,\nalong the way. The idea of it is lovely\nreally \u2013 that the disillusioned masses will leave Eastenders at home\nand wander to South Kensington\nto be informed and entertained;\nlike moths to the shiny light of sci-ence-in-public. Whether it\u2019s working\noverall is hard to say, but tonight\ncould only be described as a damp\nsquib. Despite the best intentions of\nintegrating science and comedy, the\nevening seemed only to highlight\nthe differences between the two.\nMaybe we should leave it up to Look\nAround You.\nwhich reconnection occurs extend\nover a short scale, allowing only\nevidence of patchy reconnection to\nbe found. Scientists needed observations on a much larger scale to\nprove that reconnection over distances of thousands of kilometres\ncan occur as predicted.\nThis evidence was provided in\n2002, when the team discovered that\nreconnection could take place in the\nsolar wind, a stream of particles\nejected from the atmosphere of the\nSun. Here, unlike in the magneto-sphere, the current sheets occur\nover much greater distances. This\ngave researchers the opportunity to\ntest the theory of large-scale recon-nection.\nThe first reconnection event\ndetected in the solar wind was experienced by three widely separated\nspacecraft that found it to be at\nleast 2.5 million km long. In addition,\nreconnection \u2018exhaust\u2019 was detected\nover a period of two and a half\nhours, implying that reconnection\nmust have been sustained over at\nleast that time span.\nThe team has since identified 27\nsimilar events in the solar wind,\nstrongly suggesting that recon-nection is large-scale and steady.\nProfessor Balogh of Imperial\nCollege London, an author of the\npaper, says:\n\u201cThese findings really are a breakthrough because magnetic recon-nection is very difficult to observe.\nBefore now we have had the \u2018smoking gun\u2019 of small-scale events but far\nfrom a full picture. Now for the first\ntime we have proof that reconnec-tion can and does occur on scales\nthat make it as important as theoretically predicted.\u201d\nMagnetic reconnection in solar coronal loops like these is widely\nbelieved to play a crucial role in heating the corona.\n\n"

I mean whenever I go out, I\nseem either to soak the people who\nare standing around me, or I get\nmy own eyes poked out. Is there a\nproper way to use an umbrella?\nSoaked and poked\nDear Soaked and poked,\nHmmmm interesting, etiquette to\nusing an umbrella. Well there are\nsome rules that if you follow should\nhelp you out. Firstly, when walking\nwith a group of people during\nsome monsoon like rain if you have\na gigantic umbrella (which are\njust extremely inconvenient and\ngreedy when it comes to pavement\nspace, don\u2019t get one!!) It should\ngo on the top of all the umbrellas,\nif you have a baby one don\u2019t have\nillusions off grandeur, stay on the\nbottom where you belong. Secondly\nthe best place to be is always the\nbottom centre; otherwise you just\nget run off from other umbrellas\nspoiling your hair and outfit. As to\nthe getting poked, well that mainly\nhappens to me when I let someone\ntaller than me hold the umbrella,\nand somehow it always ends up in\nmy eyes, so moral of that story, hold\nyour own umbrella, always pack a\nspare one for those people who are\nforgetful and puppy dog eye you for\nyour precious umbrella space or\nthreaten them with a painful death\nshould they poke your eye out.\nOther handy hints, beware when\nopening umbrella for smacking\nsomeone in the face, also call me\nsuperstitious but don\u2019t open an\numbrella indoors, you\u2019re just asking\nfor bad luck. If all of this has you\ntotally confused then just wear a\nraincoat and if all else fails, just\nrefuse to leave the house on rainy\ndays, which in England is most of\nthe year so be prepared to become\na hermit!\nAll by myself.....\nDear Miss C,\nMy boyfriend has just broken up\nwith me, he says he thinks its over\nbut when I asked him if we\u2019d ever\nget back together again, he said he\nwasn\u2019t sure. I call him all the time\nbecause I still really want to speak\nto him and I just can\u2019t bear the\nthought of him with someone else. I\ndon\u2019t think I can live without him,\nhow do I win him back?\nCrying In Chelsea,\nDear Crying in Chelsea,\nOh dear! You want my honest\nadvice? Let it go and please for all\nour sakes, chill with the dramatics.\nHe\u2019s broken up with you for a\nreason, and as hard as it is to break\nup with partners, you\u2019re really not\nmaking this any easier on yourself.\nIt\u2019s as though your tormenting\nyourself on purpose, which is just\nstupid. You guys have broken up for\na reason, and if you will ever have a\nchance to get back together all the\nreasons it didn\u2019t work out in the first\nplace have to be solved. For that\nyou both need time apart to think\nabout whether it will ever really\nwork again, but acting like a stalker\nand haunting his every movement\nis not going to aid your case. If\nyou blatently came out and asked\nhim if you will ever back together\nagain only heartless bastards, who\nunfortunately do exist, would ever\nsay no. In his credit he seems to be\ndealing with your hysterics pretty\nwell, but that won\u2019t last long. If you\nvalue his friendship and honestly\ndon\u2019t want to lose him, then I\u2019d say\nstep back, give the guy his space.\nIf you need a pick me up, shopping\nspree and a wild girls night out\nseems to be the medication you\nneed.\nAnd then there were none.....\nDear Miss C,\nI am currently a first year in halls,\nand been having an ok-ish time.\nHowever last week I feel asleep\ndownstairs in the common room\nand when I woke up I discovered\nI had no eyebrows. What do you\nsuggest I do?\nFeeling mutilated\nDear Feeling mutilated,\nWell as sympathetic as I am for\nyour cause, I can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t\nseem to have it coming. Falling\nasleep in the common room during\nfirst year? You might as well be\nwearing a big flashing red sign\nsaying play a prank on me!! As\nto what to do with the missing\neyebrows, well there is always the\nwear a beanie hat until they grow\nback, its still winter so you could\nget away with that. Secondly you\ncould resort to eyebrow pencil. If\nyou can\u2019t bring yourself to walk\nin to boots to buy one, I\u2019d suggest\nborrowing form a female friend\u2019s\nmake-up bag, and then try and draw\nthem back in. A hint from one girl\nto an eyebrow-less boy, sweep the\npencil in one smooth stroke, but you\ndon\u2019t want thin eyebrows so make\nthem a little bit fuller! Remember\nless is more. You never know you\nmighty turn out to have a knack\nand be complemented for your\nskills with make-up. Thirdly and\nprobably most effectively, just play\nit off as a joke!! People will probably\nrespect you for being able to take a\njoke. But if all else fails, remember\nrevenge is sweet, and a dish best\nserved cold.\nDear Miss Con\ufb01dentiality...\nHey guys! Just a quick b-day\ncall out to my lil mango!! Keep\nwriting in, this week\u2019s prize is a\ninvite for your and 2 friends to\nfelix bar night, free booze, good\ncompany, what more could you\nwant?
