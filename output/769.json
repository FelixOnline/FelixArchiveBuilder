The words of\nreform banished to a vegetarian plate,\nthe mushrooms of futility. They\ngnawed at my toes, stamped on my\nhead, chided. pushed and abused.\nDemanding the gods of revelation, the\nidols of sport, the dread cold\nemptiness of rhetoric. They stared at\nme. but I was invisible. A name on\nthe page, never a face to them.

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday May 1st19872 Forget the Empire!\nIn the mid 1970's1 was a pupil at\na junior school in the North of\nEngland. During my stay there I was\ncontinuously confronted with the\nimperial measurements. Having come\nback to the UK more than a decade\n(3.2 * 10s s) later and now to a scientific and technological\nenvironment. I am quite surprised to\nsee the situation unchanged. Over the\npast 1.43 * 10\"s of my presence here\nI have had to cope with 'kg-forces'.\nlb in:\n. atm. bar. A. in. ft. yd. miles,\n(long) tons. \u00b0F etc.\nI shall not object to using years,\nweeks. =\nC. \"of arc. metric tons etc\nas units in daily life. In many cases\nthere is too much of cultural or\nhistorical background attached to\nthese units. For scientific purposes I do however advocate only making use\nof SI units.\nThe examples mentioned in the first\nparagraph are only the tip of the\niceberg. Not only do people\nfrequently use non-SI units, often they\nuse strange combinations, wrong\nabbreviations, no units at all or\n(possibly even worse) express\nphysical quantities in units belonging\nto another quantity (power in\nnewt on!).\nIndeed industry does tend to stick\nto old units. It has often become\nvirtually impossible to change (eg oil\nindustry: pipe diameters), but do\nuniversities therefore have to preserve\nthe old units too? Has science\n(possibly as a result of (supposed?)\nunder funding and subsequent\nindustrial sponsorship) lost that much\nof its independence?\nBritain is an island (and attempts to\nchange this are not exactly being\nstimulated). Tourists like to see\nLords, bowler hats, double decker s. and...inches. However, there is more\nto this world than tourism. Britain has\nvast scientific and technological\npotential. Maybe the best way to\nconvey this to the British politicians\nis via international recognition. Surely\none needs the Systeme International\nd 'Unites to achieve this.\nI suggest forget the empire and\nadmit defeat to Napoleon!\nEA Mante, Geology I. Unfair Judgement?\nDear Dave,\nHas Catherine Manolopoulos\nactually seen Children of a Lesser\nGod or as she writes herself, did the\nmusic in the film stop her from\nthinking? Her review in FELIX 18\nMarch leaves grave doubts as to her\nability to gain any real insight into a particularly difficult subject.\nTo say that it is 'typical American\ncrap' in her opening sentence and yet\nin the same paragraph tell us that the\nactors were actually deaf seems to\nsuggest that it is far from typical. Can\nauthentic deaf actors really make the\nfilm \"seem incredible in its badness\"\nas she says, and if so, why?\nI disagree with Ms Manolopoulos'\nappraisal of Sarah (Marileen Martin)\nshe was in fact an incredibly bright\nstudent who forfeited her own abilities\nand refused to join the hearing world.\nShe preferred to be a lavatory cleaner\nin a deaf institution because it was\nsomething she could do well in a seemingly sympathetic environment.\nHer refusal to learn to speak stemmed\nfrom a tragic past history (was Ms\nManolopoulos asleep whilst this was\nrevealed?). Sarah was sexually abused\nwhen a teenager by her sister's boyfriends. Sex to Sara was a form\nof communication, and it was\nsomething she could do well without\nspeaking (like cleaning loos!). Instead\nof bringing this sad fact to light, Ms\nManolopoulos. portrays Sarah as as e duc tress, a mermaid no less. This\nis an unfair, misleading and sexist\nview of her nature.\nIn fact the whole review is full of\nunfair judgements and ill-thought-out\ncomment. I suggest you re-read your\nwork Ms Manopoulos it is an\nill judged appraisal, your crass\ncriticism and glib remarks make me\ndoubt your worthiness as a critic.\nJane Hosking\nKQC College\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit.

The majority of people I have spoken to agreed with me. and\nnearly all the derogatory remarks I have heard have reached me second\nhand (I was quite proud to hear IC\nRadio playing Tom Robinson's 'Sing\nif you're glad to be Gay' as a dedication for me). A few days ago\nI met an IC student who thought that\nmy editorial was a 'terrible thing to\nwrite' and was quite genuinely upset\nby the implication that he and other\nstudents should be able to recognise\nsome degree of homosexuality in\nthemselves.\nI am still convinced that the men\n(and I shall restrict this to men for the\nmoment) who go through adolescence\nwithout experiencing any physical\nfeelings towards other men are in the\nminority. I am not trying to make out\nthat we were all sharing beds as fourth\nformer s(I did not attend a boarding\nschool) but simply that sexual feelings\nare extremely complex and not\nrestricted to a desire to penetrate other\npeoples bodies. I regard the progress\nthe Union has made on the gay rights\nfront as the major success of the year\nand I will support this wholeheartedly\nas long as 1 am editor of the student\nnewspaper. 1 raise the subject again\nfor no other reason than to invite\ncomment. This issue is not going to\nbe forgotten and 1 welcome any\ncorrespondence.\nElection fever grips IC!\nAnother round of sabbatical elections\nis upon us. and at the last minute\nseveral fresh faces have joined the\npresidential race. If another round of\nhustings and ballot boxes seems\ntedious, particularly in the middle of\nthe exam period, then please consider\nthe influence the sabbatical officers\ncan have on the lives of all IC\nstudents. Good sabbaticals may seem\nto achieve little of consequence, but\npoor ones can really leave their mark.\nMy advice on voting remains the\nsame; decide which candidate is\nstanding for the right reasons and\nplease take the trouble to vote for\nthem.\nCredits\nMany thanks to Dave Burns, Judith\nHackney, Kamala Sen, Mark Cottle,\nDave Williams, Hamster, Chris\nMartin, Andy Bannister, Francis\nMiers, Liz Holford, Neil Motteram,\nSean MacRae, Steve Kilmurray,\nJane Spiegel, Aaron Kotcheff, Steve\nShackell and Rose Atkins.\nANNUAL REPORTS\nThe ICU AGM is on Tuesday May19 th.

Imperial women's squad, comprising\n9 dedicated members?? selected 8\noars women and a cox to enter as a??? crew. They stomped home 61st out\nof an unusually large field of over a thousand. This was a quite\nremarkable result for a crew of such\nmixed experience although they were\naiming for the top sixty.\nMega-coaches Richard Evans and\nTim Lohmann (of Lohmann Rowing\nClub) worked miracles with those\nwho only started rowing in October,\nand attempted to correct the odd crew\nmember who had been rowing badly\nfor years. Despite only being able to\nrow together as an eight on a few\noccasions, exceptionally hard training\nthroughout the winter paid off. Good\nspirits in the boat and excellent co xing from Diana Montgomery resulted in\na row worthy of a crew of higher\nstatus.\nOxford is not the only crew to\nimpart muscle from the States.\nColleen Kaleta arrived at the last\nminute to train for the race, just as\n-Mandy Phillips was recovering from\nserious illness to take up her place in\nthe bow. Charlotte Evans and Alison\nLapp overcame a sizeable problem by\nbeing incredibly fit. Amazing\nperformances also from Bridget\nFarnon, Pam Evans and Kathy\nMarriot. I was in the boat as well.\nThe squad is now anticipating an\noutstanding regatta season.\nBow: A Phillips, A Capp,\nK Marriott, B Farnon, C Evans,\nC Kaleta, P Sansom, R Thomson\n(Sir), D Montgomery.\nWater Polo\nSecret\nWeapons\nOn Sunday 15th March at 3.00pm, teams from Tizard and Selkirk met to\ncontest the inter-hall gala. Due to\nLinstead hiding outside for an hour,\nSelkirk and Tizard displayed their\nprowess in water polo, until Linstead\ncould be enticed to wet their feet.\nThe gala commenced at four\no 'clock with Linstead taking an early\nlead through ULU swimmer, Steve.\nAs the gala proceeded, Selkirk fell by\nthe wayside, largely due to their\nfemale contingent being too demure\nto show themselves. Tizard crawled\nup, and as the last relay was\nannounced, there was just half a point\nbetween Tizard and Linstead.\nTizard's secret weapons\u2014Shark\nFin (John) and Oppy (Simon) led off\nfor them, giving an early advantage,\nwhich was held by brilliant\nperformances from Pete 'Submarine'\nGilbert and Aquatic Emma. Team\ncaptain Nikki splashed the next 25m, followed by 'the unknown swimmer'\nNeil. Gremlin Gizmo (Ian) set up the\nfinal leg for Kipper (Dave Wall) to\nseize the championship for Tizard. A special mention must go to Tracy,\nwho showed style with the inflatables,\nthanks to Andrew and James for their\norganisation (although they lost\u2014ha\nha).\nDramsoc\nEdinburgh\nAuditions\nPreparations are now well under way\nfor the 1987 Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival. As well as running one of\nthe biggest venues in the festival\nDramSoc will also be performing\nthree plays; Bent by Martin Sherman,\nTwo Way Mirror by Arthur Miller\nand The Collection and The Lover by\nHarold Pinter. Auditions are in the\nUpper Lounge at 1 30pm on Sunday\n3rd and Wednesday 6th May. All are\nwelcome, no previous experience\nrequired.\nDance Club\nOff Beat Performance\nThe end of last term saw the highlight\nof the dancing calender for Imperial\nCollege Dance Club.\nOn the 28th February the Southern\nUniversities Ball was held, hosted by\nSouthampton, with Imperial taking\ntwo teams of four couples to compete.\nDespite strong opposition, notably\nfrom Cambridge and Oxford\nUniversities, all but one of our\ncouples successfully progressed\nthrough three heats to reach the semi\nfinals. A particularly encouraging and\nenthusiastic performance was given\nby Steve Mercer and Alice Jacques,\nwho had only started dancing this year\nbut still managed to get through to the\nsemi finals of the jive competition.\nOur finalists included Neil\nMcCluskey and Dinah Woodhurst in\nthe jive, Simon Denyer and Rachel\nConder in the quickstep and also Ruth\nSteadman and Sharad Somany in the\ncha-cha-cha. They were placed 5th,7 th and 6th respectively. Success was\nachieved when, performing our\nversion of \"Greased Lightning\",\nImperial College won the offbeat\ncompetition at the end of the evening.\nOn March 14th the Inter-Varsity\nBall was held at Bristol with\ncompetitors coming from as far away\nas Edinburgh to compete.\nImperial took 4 couples along to\ncompete and also their victorious\noffbeat team. A sparkling\nperformance by Neil McCluskey and\nDinah Woodhurst won them 2nd place in the final of the jive, with two\nother couples reaching the semi finals.\nYet again the offbeat team was\nplaced 1st after a somewhat\ncomplacent performance, but with an\nexciting interpretation by Will\nMcDonald and Sarah Rogles.\nSpecial thanks must go to Vikki\nCunniffe, our dancing instructor and\nher husband, Harry, for services\nrendered.\nSimon Denyer, Publicity Officer\nOpSoc\nMarathon\nThis weekend, from noon on\nSaturday, OpSoc will be performing\nall of the 13 Gilbert & Sullivan Savoy\nOperas one after the other, in aid of\nthis year's rag charities. The event\nwill take place in the Union Concert\nHall until sometime on Sunday\nafternoon, so please come along and\nwatch, sing, or donate, or all three if\nyou like.

    "content": "-eat ure FELIX, Friday May 1st19876 BIG CONNECTIONS The Pimlico Connection 1987/88\nUGC backs IC scheme to encourage\nothers to set up similar student\n'tutoring' schemes\n\"It was a tremendous boost when I overheard one pupil saying that she'd learnt more in one lesson when I had\nbeen explaining things to her than\nshe'd learnt the rest of the year''. This\ncomment by one of this year's IC\ntutors sums up much of the\nsatisfaction and sense of achievement\nparticipate in teaching Science. Maths\nand 'CDT' at both secondary and\nprimary level in ILEA schools, with\nHolland Park School currently\nproviding about half of the tutoring\nplaces. Over seven thousand pupils\nhave now experienced tutoring by UC\nundergraduates and show, through\nannually completed questionnaires,\ncontinued benefits from such tutoring.\nIn 1986/87 nearly fifty students\nfrom eleven different departments\nspent their Wednesday afternoons, up\nAt least half of the current tutors\nhave never had any intention of\nteaching but have been attracted to the\nscheme primarily by the opportunity\nof having real practice in trying to\ncommunicate scientific ideas at a simple level, alongside professional\neducators. This, combined with\ninsights gained from visiting multi-ethnic inner-city schools with fellow\nstudents, provides sufficient\nmotivation for most of those who\nbecome tutors. There are some, of\nteachers in the scheme, to learn about\nthe ILEA'S 'SMILE' Mathematics\nprogramme, and gain some idea of the\nfairly challenging role of a tutor\nthrough simulation games and\ndiscussion with former tutors.\nAs part of its scheme to improve the\ndwindling supply of school teachers\nin Mathematics, Physics and\nTechnology, the UGC has agreed to\nfund an IC proposal by Dr Goodlad\nto fund a Research and Project\nDevelopment Officer from September\nthat encourages students at Imperial\nto join the College tutoring scheme,\nknown familiarly as the 'Pimlico\nConnection'.\nIn 1975/76 the Pimlico School\nbecame the first of six schools to have\na tutoring link with Imperial. Dr\nSinclair Goodlad had arranged for\ntwelve third-year Electrical\nEngineering students to investigate\nthe feasibility of undergraduates\nacting as 'tutors', by assisting\nteachers in 'combined science'\nclasses. The initial, three-year phase\nof research was funded by the\nLeverhulme Foundation as part of Dr\nGoodlad's ongoing research into\n'study-service' in the UK and USA.\nNow completing its twelfth year,\nthis IC tutoring scheme has enabled\nnearly seven hundred students to\nuntil the end of January, in five\nschools. Nearly a third of the tutors\nwere female, providing useful 'role-models' for pupils who often associate\nscience exclusively with men.\nMore information about the IC\ntutoring scheme and applications for\n1987/88 is available from the\nHumanities Department, 53 Prince's Gate. The 'Pimlico Connection\nSociety', a students' union society,\nwill have at least one meeting during\nthe term to welcome its new\ncommittee and any prospective tutors/\ninterested students. The Society\nusually meets in the Electrical\nEngineering building. This year's officers are Keith Bell of Chem Eng\n4 (Chairman and Treasurer) and\nRichard Bleasdale of Elec Eng 4\n(Social Secretary).\ncourse, who wish to see whether their\nideas of being teachers stand up to the\ntest of reality or not. It can be really\nuseful to know if one is not suited\nrather than spending a postgraduate\nyear of teacher training to find out.\nOr, as one of this year's tutors put it:\n\"The Pimlico connection scheme\nhelped me make up my mind about\nnot teaching. My reasons were\ncomplicated, but at least now I 'll not\npursue my career wondering what\nteaching would have been like. I do\nnow have some idea. Anyway,\nregardless of this I think the\nexperience of the scheme is very\nvaluable in itself.\"\nAll prospective tutors are\nencouraged to attend a training\nsession on the first Saturday of the\nAutumn term to meet some of the\n1987/89. This appointment will draw\non the unique experience gained at\nImperial to increase awareness,\nnationally, of how such tutoring\nschemes can operate, and, if possible,\nto establish at least one other, similar,\nscheme in London. The post is likely\nto be suitable for a teacher on\nsecond ment, as advertised this week\nin The Guardian.\nNo experience needed. Why not\njoin the 'Pimlico Connection' now!\nDavid J Berry\n(Staff coordinator of the scheme\nduring Dr Goodlad's current\nsecond ment) "

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday May 1st198712 No BT,\nno comment\nAn intense environmental conflict is\nset to explode in Prince Consort\nRoad.\nLast week British Telecom decided\nto replace the old red telephone box\nbetween the. RSM building and the\nRCM. with a brand, spanking new\none of the smoked glass and\naluminium variety.\nHowever. City of Westminster\nCouncil, have moved quickly\ndeeming it to be of \"architectural or\nhistorical interest\", and thus\nprotecting it with a building\npreservation order.\nThe Council told FELIX that the\ntelephone box now has at least six\nmonths grace whilst it is considered\nby the Department of the\nEnvironment for inclusion as a listed\nbuilding.\nThe Council spokeswoman said that\nshe didn't like the new boxes and that\nit was council policy to preserve the\nold style boxes wherever they are in\nkeeping with the character of their\nsurroundings.\nBT were unavailable for comment\nand it is unclear whether or not it will\naffect the price of their shares.\nNew man for IC\nICU will be taking on a fourth\nmember of Union Office permanent\nstaff. College administration have\napproved the post of a Union\naccountant. who will have\nresponsibility for looking after all the\nUnion books and preparing the\naccounts for the auditors. The Union\nOffice is to be extended into the\nUpper Lounge to provide extra office\nspace. The new job description will\nbe finalised shortly, and it is hoped\nthat an appointment will be made at\nthe end of June. College Secretary\nJohn Smith is keen to see the Union\nOffice permanent staff expand to five\nat the end of next year, when the area\nof greatest need has been identified.\nMark will be back next week\nMoney for\nUnion gym\nThe Union Gym, on the second floor\nof the Union Building, is to undergo\nmajor refurbishment over the\nsummer. The money will be available\nbecause of a re-arrangement in the\nway that maintenance of the Union\nBuilding is funded.\nPreviously the Union has been\ngiven money for furniture and\nequipment, but major maintenance\nand re decoration has been the\nresponsibility of the College. John\nSmith, the College Secretary, is\nproposing that the Union be given an\nincreased amount, about \u00a325,000, to\npay for all decoration in the Union\nBuilding, apart from major structural\nand electrical work.\nAs part of the changeover, the\nCollege may pay for the\nrefurbishment of the Gym, including\nsanding the floor and modernising the\nchanging rooms, at a cost of about\n\u00a37,000\u2014although a similar\nrefurbishment of the Union Dining\nHall and kitchens on the first floor\nwill be paid for from the Union fund.\nThere is a possibility that wire will\nbe placed over the windows in the\nGym, thus allowing the playing of\nball games, and the floor being\nmarked for fencing and badminton,\ninstead of fencing and basketball as\nit is at the moment.\nLong term plans on the completion\nof the proposed sports centre include\nfitting a permanent mat to the floor\nand making the Union Gym suitable\nfor more specialist uses.\nMuseum\nstaff strike\nMuseum clerical staff are to go on\nstrike on Thursday 7th and Friday 8th May in a demand for higher pay.\nSince 1980 when the Government\nterminated an agreement linking\nsalaries of civil servants with those in\nthe private sector, their pay has\ndecreased by 20% in real terms. To\nremedy this the CPSA (Civil and\nPublic Service Association) wants the\naverage pay of its members increased\nby \u00a320 from the present average of\n\u00a388 a week. The Treasury is only\nprepared to provide a4.25% increase\n(\u00a35.75 for most people). Over half the\n140,000 membership of the CPSA\nvoted by a margin of 2 to 1 to strike,\nso from the start of next week staff\nin Government departments such as\nHealth and Social Security and\nCustom and Excise will take action.\nAdministrative and secretarial staff\nfrom the Geological, Science and\nVictoria and Albert museums join\nthem on Thursday and Friday. Branch\nsecretary Philip Shaw said that the\nstrike would not cause serious\ndisruption to the running of the\nmuseum but would inconvenience the\nmanagement. He pointed out that\nCPSA members were not noted for\nbeing militant so that the vote to strike\nwas an indication of how bad the\nsituation is. Christine Taig, IC Union\n200 in new\nhouses\nCollege will be acquiring 200 new\nplaces in house-type accommodation\nfor next year. Subject to confirmation\nof planning details and financial\nsupport, Michael Arthur, College\nAssistant Secretary, hopes to sign\ncontracts this week. Although the new\nplaces will not be available until\nOctober, it is hoped they will allow\nall first years to be offered places in\nresidence.\nIt is expected that rents will have\nto rise more than usual for all College\naccommodation to cover the financing\nof the project.\nMeanwhile, College are planning to\ninstall an additional warden in\nSouthside. This will mean the loss of\none of the penthouse flats which\nwould otherwise be available for\nstudent use. The Union Executive are\nunhappy that this decision has been\ntaken by the administration without\nany consultation or explanation. They\nbelieve there will always be a desperate need for such\naccommodation.\n\n"

    "content": "Union FELIX, Friday May 1st19874 President's Prose\nFighting off those urges\nGAY\nNEWS\nHello and welcome back to sun-kissed\nImperial College. As I write this, there\nis sun streaming into the office and I'm having to fight of! urges to go and bask\nin the warmth\u2014surely a better option\nthan working. In short, it's typical\nexam term weather...well. I hope\nthose of you taking exams aren't too\ndistracted by the heat\u2014and I wish you\nluck. Meanwhile, a few things of\ninterest.\nThe Great Presidential Election\nFollowing the complete fiasco last\nterm, the presidential election is being\nre-run. The Hustings UGM is next\nThursday, May 7th at 1pm; voting\ntakes place on Tuesday and\nWednesday, 12th and 13th of May. I realise that an awful lot of people are\nsomewhat preoccupied by academic\nmatters at the moment, but if you can\nspare the time please come along to\nthe Hustings and to vote. Nobody\nwould choose to have an election this\n:erm but now we're stuck with it; so\nplease try and take part.\nOn the same subject, if anyone can\nspare a few hours on May 12th and\n13th and would like to earn a few i pounds for guarding ballot boxes (it's not hard work and you can\nread/revise at the same time), come\nand see Jen or Dave Colley in the\nUnion Office as soon as possible.\nMore Wild and Wacky things\nhappening in the Union Building\nOn Wednesday from May 5th, Kate\nfrom Studio 35 on Marloes Road will\nbe cutting hair for \u00a35 a time in the\nEnts. Committee Room (above the\nnew FELIX Office). We can certainly\nvouch for Kate\u2014whether your style is\nwild and wacky or straightforward\nand respectable; she's responsible not\nonly for my shorter cuts, but also for\nJackie's 'Glenda Jackson' look, Kathy's wild waves and Jen's spiky\nsophisticated image...however she's got nothing to do with Gutman's unique coiffure! So if anyone, male or\nfemale, needs a haircut, come along\nany Wednesday.\nIf you're working so hard this term\nthat you can't find time for shopping\nand cooking, remember that the\nUnion Snack Bar is open for lunch\n(10am \u20143pm) and supper (6pm \u20149pm) with plenty of hot food and fresh\nsalads all at amazingly low prices.\nThere's plenty of room to sit in Beit\nQuad and catch a bit of sun while you\neat.\nNALGO Pay Claim\nNALGO, the union representing\nmost of the College's clerical and\nrelated staff, is currently negotiating\nthe 1987 pay claim. Clerical staff in\nuniversities earn far less than their\ncounterparts in the private sector, and\nno doubt this partially explains the\nhigh turnover of staff at College. It's a vicious circle; in times of financial\ncuts to universities non-academic staff\nsalaries are liable to suffer; but if the\nCollege is to run efficiently, good\nadministration staff are essential and\nneed to be paid accordingly. I only\nhope that the outcome of the claim\nreflects the vital role of clerical and\nadministration workers in academic\ninstitutions.\nMissing Persons\nI 've had a letter from a woman\ncalled Joan, from Inverness. She's trying to contact a student from New\nYork, probably called Eric. Eric is\nabout 21, 5' 10\" tall with mousey hair.\nHe was in Inverness on 20th February\nand went to a disco there called\n\"Dillingers\", leaving at midnight. If this\nis you, or you know someone who\nmight be 'Eric', come and see me as\nthere's a contact address for you. Yes,\nthis is serious and apparently Joan has\na very good reason for contacting\nyou!\nThat's it for now, have fun.\nChristine\nSad to say, Robert Daniel has now left\nImperial for ever\u2014could be a wise\nmove\u2014but the work he undertook for\nthe gay and lesbian students of the\nCollege lives on. If you check our\nnoticeboard, on the left hand side of\nthe foyer of the Union building, you\nwill see that we are now meeting in\nthe Green Committee Room on the\ntop floor of the Union Building, every\nWednesday at 12.30pm. If you are gay or lesbian, and you've\ntold people about it, well done and\nwe'll be glad to see you. If you aren't, try turning up anyway. You'll find us\na reasonably ordinary bunch, and you\nmight learn a thing or two about us.\nBut most importantly: If you are gay,\nand you haven't told anyone, please\ndon't be afraid to come along and say\nhello. Most of us have been in that\nsituation at some time; I will never\nforget what it's like to conceal part of\nyourself from everyone, even your\nclosest friends. Don't worry about\nbeing seen on your way to the Green\nCommittee Room: 98% of IC students\nprobably don't know you, and I don't suppose that the other two per cent\nwill realise where you are going.\nTowards the end of last term FELIX\nreceived a letter signed only by 'One\nof the few' which saddened me\ntremendously. In tone it was the\nwriting of someone who had almost\ngiven up hope of ever being accepted,\nor of being free to be themselves. If the writer of that letter is reading this,\nI implore them, or anyone like them,\nto turn up on Wednesday and tell\nsomeone about it. At the moment, that\nis about the only way you can make\nyour life any better.\nA final rousing chorus: I have always\nbeen quite happy about my sexuality.\nAs a result of the support I have\nreceived, sometimes from the most\nunlikely people, I am now proud of it.\nThank you all.\nAndrew Bannister\nNOTICE Would ALL clubs and societies collect your mail\nfrom the Union or I will throw it in the bin! Also,\ncould you fill in the details of next year's committee\nas soon as possible (details in your letter racks!).\nThanks,\nKathy Tait\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded1949 IC buy the blues\nIC Boat Club have purchased the boat\nthat Oxford rowed to victory in this\nyear's University Boat Race. The\nrowing-eight has cost \u00a39,000 and has\nonly been used 5 times: it cost over\n\u00a314,000 when new.\nThe boat was ordered at the\nbeginning of March by College\nAssistant Secretary Michael Arthur,\nand the money has come from the\nCollege Activities Loan Fund. It is\nplanned that the money will be\nreclaimed from the Union and the\nQueensgate Trust\u2014a fund to pay for\nrecreational facilities at College.\nDiscussions started in January\nbetween the Boat Club. Michael\nArthur and IC Union. ICU Deputy\nPresident Jackie Peirce could not\nmake any assurances about any Union\nmoney being available to pay for the\nboat, as it would come from money\nallocated for next year's equipment\nplan. Claims have to be passed by\nUnion Finance Committee and the\nboat cost nearly half the total amount\navailable to clubs and societies for\nequipment. Despite this. Michael\nArthur ordered the boat at the\nbeginning of March. When contacted\nby FELIX he said he had made \"no\nassumptions\" about where the m one\\ would finally come from although he\ndid mention the Queensgate Trust and\nthe Union Equipment Plan. He said\nthat the money would be recovered\n\"as soon as the Boat Club has the\nmoney to pay for it\".\nThe Union sabbaticals were\nsurprised to hear that the boat had\nbeen ordered, however, as they had\nnot heard from the Boat Club and\nMichael Arthur since January and the\nBoat Club had not mentioned it at the\nlast Union Finance Committee (UFC)\nmeeting in mid-March. Jackie Peirce\nsaid she was unhappy about not being\nkept informed, and said that if the\nUFC decided it could not afford to\npay for the boat then the Boat Club\nwould have to find the money itself.\nThe matter is likely to be brought\nup at the next UFC to be held in a few\nweeks time, a number of Union\nofficials are unhappy about not being\ninformed about such a large\nexpenditure and being presented with\na 'fait ac com pl is'. They are also\nunhappy about the Boat Club claiming\nthat they had lost the chance to buy\nthe boat at the UFC meeting in mid-March when the Boat Club put in an\nincreased claim of \u00a314.000 to buy a new boat even though the Oxford boat\nhad al read v been ordered.\nMichael Arthur\nNew faces in\nPresidential election:\nExcitement reaches\nfever-pitch\nThere were three late entries in the ICU sabbatical presidential\nelection this week. Roger Loughney (Physics), Junichi Imura\n(Met & Mat) and Symon Corns (Chem Eng) entered the race\non Wednesday, only one day before the papers were due to\ncome down. They join Ian Howgate (Geology) and Paul Bailey\n(Physics) who put their names forward before the Easter\nHoliday.\nThe contest is being rerun because of a decision by Elections\nCommittee to invalidate last term's presidential election because\nthe candidates had breached publicity rules.\nThe hustings UGM will take place at 1.00pm in the Great\nHall next Thursday and the manifestos will appear in the next\nissue of FELIX. Voting is on Tuesday 12th and Wednesday 13th May.\nFiremen fight the soot\nin Hamlet Gardens\nA Hamlet Gardens flat was severely\ndamaged by fire last weekend. The\nfire broke out in the kitchen of\nbasement flat 201 on Saturday\nevening at around 8pm. The flat was\nunoccupied at the time, and the fire\nwas not discovered until 10.30pm when Andrew March, another\nresident, noticed smoke in the\nstairwell and alerted the Hamlet\nGardens Warden Geoff Hungerford.\nMr Hungerford attempted to enter the\nflat immediately, fearing that one or\nmore of the residents might be asleep.\nThere was so much smoke inside the\nflat, however, that he was initially\nunable to get very far inside. The fire\nbrigade were called and arrived at\naround 10.50pm. when it was\ndiscovered that the fire itself was\nconfined to a very small area in the\nkitchen. The whole of the flat was full\nof thick smoke, though, and the walls,\ncarpets and furniture were covered in\nheavy soot. Only one of the occupants\nhad returned to the flat after the Easter\nvacation, and so not many personal\nbelongings were damaged in the fire.\nThe landlords' representatives\ninspected the flat on Wednesday. The\nflat will have to be redecorated\ncompletely, and the cost is estimated\nto be in the region of \u00a31000. This will\nbe covered by the landlords' insurers.\nAll but one of the students are still\nliving in the flat, despite the extent of\nthe damage. One of the occupants told\nFELIX that only a small number of\npersonal effects were damaged. He\nadded that the students had not been\ngiven any assistance in clearing up the\nflat.\nFree!

    "content": "News. FELIX, Friday May 1st1987 Parliamentary hang-ups\nMr Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP\nfor Great Grimsby, addressed a Socialist Society meeting in Huxley\n139 last Tuesday. In an eighty minute\ntalk including a question and answer\nsession, he devoted much of his time\nto talking about the economy. He said\nthat in 1979 the country had had an\nhistoric opportunity, in the form of\nNorth Sea oil, to expand its economy\nwithout incurring a balance of\npayments crisis. Mrs Thatcher's gov rn ment, he said, had wasted that\nopportunity by destroying an\nunprecedented number of jobs and\nusing the oil money to pay for the\nstate debt. He stressed that growth\nwas the key to a healthy economy and\nthat it should be achieved, if\nnecessary, by deficit budgeting and\nletting one's currency drop.\nWhen asked about Labour's defence policy, Mr Mitchell said that\nhe thought British nuclear weapons\nunnecessary, but he would prefer to\nget rid of them by negotiation rather\nthan unilaterally.\nOn the election, he said that he did\nnot think there would be a hung\nparliament, but if there were, and\nLabour were the largest party, it\nLabour ready to accept power\nwould try to govern anyway without\ncompromising its policies. When\nquestioned about proportional\nrepresentation, he said that he was\npart of a growing minority in the\nLabour Party in favour of it, though\nit was not official Labour Party\npolicy.\nPrinces\namongst\nKings\nIn the one hundred and fiftieth\nanniversary of the University of\nLondon debating competition, a bele a gu red IC DebSoc team\ntriumphed over huge opposition,\nincluding the London School of\nEconomics, and no less than five\nteams from Kings.\nIn the first round of rapid debates,\nthe IC team carried the majority on\nthe motion that 'This house believes\nthat history is bunk', and successfully\nopposed the statement that 'This\nhouse believes that a man's place is\nin the home', scoring around 60\npoints out of a maximum seventy on\nboth.\nThe semi-final saw them set against\nthe LSE in the motion that 'This house\nwould start again', a performance\nwhich took them to the final, against\none of the many teams from Kings,\nwhich was chaired by KQC principal\nStewart Sutherland, and judged by\nLord Flowers and Lord Elwin Jones.\nThe crucial motion was that 'This\nhouse has no faith in human nature',\nand the highly skilled IC team of Matt\nDesselberger and DebSoc chair Dan\nSalmons naturally carried off the\nprize, the Oxford Reference\nDictionary, signed by the judges and\npresented by Lady Flowers.\nUl U travel Wherever you'd rather be...\n.

Although Blue\nVelvet is a fairly low budget film its\nsubject matter makes it heavily\ndebatable.\nIn complete contrast the continuing\nepic of the Starship Enterprise in the\nform of Star Trek IV is definitely light\nentertainment. This episode sees the\nusual bunch of galactic heroes\nhurtling back to the wild and primitive\n20th Century to save Earth in the\nfuture. This is obviously a very neat\ntrick if you can do it. It is of course\ngiving little away to say that the good\nguys scrape back into the future neatly\nin the nick of time to save the day so\nthat Star Trek V can begin with\neverything intact. It must be said that\n23rd Century spaceships are\nLetting us down?\nIf there is one thing one can be sure\nof when Mr Bowie announces a new\nalbum it is that it is likely to be quite\nunlike anything he has done before.\nNever Let Me Down is now different\nin this respect. Unfortunately the\nalbum is distinguished from his\nprevious works by a complete lack of\nmusical originality and turgid lyrics.\nMr Bowie has attempted to join the\nsocial awareness bandwagon with\nsongs about nuclear war, AIDS and\ndrugs. He succeeds only in producing\nsome very clich ed songs which quite\nfrankly are very dull indeed. His\nGlass Spider fairy tale monologue for\nexample is reminiscent of the\nDiamond Dogs introduction, but\nseems shallow in comparison.\nIn spite of the ten or so musicians\ncredited on the album cover the music\nsounds very computerised and\noverproduced to the point where it\ngrates. Yet here and there there are\ntouches of the genius Bowie once\nwas. I think Bowie still has the\npotential; whether or not it will be\nreawakened remains to be seen.\nR2D2\new Spandex for\nOld Cliches\nThe Queerboys\u2014Marquee\nThe Marquee Glam-Gang were out in\nforce on Saturday, the occasion was\nan up-and-coming British rock band,\nThe Queerboys. They have over the\npast year built up a strong reputation\nand following. They already\ncommand the attention of established\nrock musicians from the likes of\nHanoi Rocks, The Babysitters, Torme\nand UFO (the bass player, Nigel, is\nPhil Moog's nephew).\nTheir style is tough rock 'n' roll,\nwith the blues ry th ms of the early\nRolling Stones, to the hard rock\nmelodies of Kiss or Aerosmith.\nThe audience loved every note and\nmovement of a band that have the real\npotential to strike their own mark as\na British name in a, now, American\ndominated rock world.\nFrom the opening song, That's Right, through old favourites like Sex\nParty, Pretty Girls and 7 O 'clock,\nthey held the audience in a web of\nexcitement and sheer good time rock\n'n' roll.\nThey are currently on a small UK\ntour and will be back at the Marquee\non May 23rd. BE THERE and enjoy\nyourself.\nDavid Williams\n\n"
