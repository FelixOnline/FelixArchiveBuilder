    "content": "10 - FELIX, OCTOBER29 th1976 EXTERNAL AFFAIRS Debating Society\nThe University of London Union has\ntwo main aims. The first is to bring\ntogether students from all colleges within\nthe University via Sporting Clubs and\nSocieties, catering for a wide range of\nactivities not found in the smaller\ncolleges. Many of the sports clubs\ncompete at a very high level and represent\nthe University in British University\nSports Federation competitions. The other aim is to represent student views\nto the University authorities on matters\nwhich are not confined to a single\ncollege. UL U therefore has three main\nareas of activity - Sports, Societies and\nthe Students Representative Council( SRC).\nHow it's all run\nEach function is run by a seperate\nbody. In the case of the clubs and\nsocieties it is a committee comprising\nrepresentatives from each individual\nclub/ society; In the case of the S RC it is a committee of delegates from all the colleges within the University, the\nnumber of delegates being roughly\nproportional to the number of students at\nthat college. These three bodies, the\nSports Council, Societies Council and\nS RC are co-ordinated by the General\nPurposes Committee, consisting of\nrepresentatives from each committee,\ntogether with the President and Deputy\nPresident. The latter two are sabbatical\nofficers elected annually by a joint\nmeeting of the Clubs and Societies\ncommittees and the S RC. The GP C also\nhas overall responsibility for Sennet and\noverlooks the Union's financial expend i ture. The Union is financed directly by\nthe University and this year's budget\nis of the order of \u00a3120,000.\nOrange Mole on SRC Exec\nThe S RC is the only student body\nrecognised by London University as a negotiating body and consequently\nrepresents students on matters of\nUniversity wide Interest such as Intercollegiate Halls. It also sends elected\nrepresentatives to the Joint Committee of\nSenate/Students Representative Council. IC usually sends three or four delegates\nto S RC meetings usually the President,\nExternal Affairs Officer and U LURe p, who this year is -D Harris son. We also have Derrick Everett who last year was e Iected as a member of the S RC Exec \u2014 qu i ie\na surprise since the S RC is dominated b v the Broad Left, and they usually carve up\nthe elections between themselves. In fact\nboth this year's President and Deputy\nPresident, Richard Silver and Lyn Millington-Wallace are Broad Left members\nStructure report expected\nAt present a working party is investigating the structure of UL U and is supposed to report back soon with\nproposals to change the basis of membership from individual members to a structure more akin to NUS that is a confederation of college Union s.ULU membership cards are necessary when\nyou wish to use the facilities offered at\nMalet St, and are available from your\nConstituant College Union offices not\nfrom the ICU office.\nHugh Barrett\nExternal Affairs Officer\nFollowing the large amount of interest\nshown at the Freshers Fair, the Debating\nSociety is organising a varied series of\nmeetings for this year. We have two awards\nto be won \u2014 an inter C CU trophy and a fresher s pot.\nThere are also plans for a debate\nbetween two prominent outside speakers,\npossibly Members of Parliament. Later on\nthis year, the College may enter a team\nfor a national students debating competition\norganised by the 'Observer' newspaper.\nHowever, the first debate to be held this\nyear will be a part of the series of the\ninter C CU debates. Full details will be\nadvertised throughout College and in the near future.\nThe C CU trophy is to be contested on\na league basis; each union entering one\nor more teams of three people. The fresher s pot may be awarded to the first\nyear student who performs the best in\nthese debates, or, if there is sufficient\ninterest, by a' balloon debate' later on in the year.

Sue Kali c in ski, last year's Welfare Officer, nobly held\nthe fort in a temporary nature but now I have taken over and the Union has a fully fledged Welfare Officer, elected\nand actually in situ.

You're\nalways welcome to drop in or phone\n(Internal 2898).\nThe centre is manned by Don A ding ton, the Student Counsellor, on Tuesdays\nand Thursdays, and by myself or some\nother student during the rest of the week.\nIt is hoped that there will be a legal\nadvice service on Wednesdays later on in\nthe term.This will be provided by students\nfrom the London School of economics.\nWell, what does the Centre provide?\nWhat follows is a brief resume of some\nof the sectors in which welfare is\ninvolved.\nAccommodation\nWe have some info on flat agencies\nthat are hopefully still in existence and\nnot too crooked. The centre can also help if you run into difficulties with flat\nagencies. For instance when you go to\nan agency they have no right to charge\nyou for providing addresses.\n1\nBtfepiinfog\nThe centre is not offering to take\nover the IC Nursery's role, but if you\nwould like to earn some money babysitting or require a sitter please inform\nthe Welfare Centre and we will operate\nas are feral agen cv.

IC were complacent and lethargic, Lin dong showing as much enthusiasm as a eunuch\nin a brothel, and Huntington\nplaying in a mental fog after\nhis rapid promotion to the\ndizzy heights of the first team,\nHowever Steve Gee showed\nsigns of life and on several\noccasions he actually raised a canter, proving what a night\nof abstinence can do for you.Th a first half wore on and\nfinished without serious\nincident. (Half tin\u00ae 0 \u20140).\nEarly in the second half the\ncrowd (one gardener) was stunned to silence as the\nsequence of events leading to\nthe UC goal unfolded. Baker,\n\u2022who was intent on carnal\nmayhem, joined with B rabb in, who was taking time off from\nhis daisy picking, and both\nspec tate d the departure of a UC forward as he calmly\nstroked the ball past the\noutstretched hands of the IC keeper Allen. Injuries\nIC were then floored once\nmore as Chris Howley and\nPat Frampton made Bugner and\nDunn look like Bill and Ben. With a resounding crash the\ntwo gladiators fell to the\nground with hideous head\ninjuries seemingly to take no\nfurther part in the game.\nWith 9 men IC surged\nforward but time was ticking away. Grimwade had a shot\nscrambled off the line. A header from Lin dong scraped\nthe outside of the post from a well-struck Huntington free-kick. With minutes to go\nFrampton and Howley returned\nto the game swathed from head\nto foot in ela strop last. Seconds remaining, a. free-kick struck by Grimwade into\nthe UC penalty area for\nHuntington to p ivo ue tte on a sixpence and strike the ball\nsomehow into the net on his third attempt. Final score 1\u20141.\n. . . . while Seconds 'Superstars' demolish nets\nIC's 'Wednesday 2 nd team'\ntook to the field at Shenley last\nWednesday in a confident frame\nof mi'nd, following the 3\u20141\ndefeat of Kings College Hospital Seconds the previous\nWednesday.\nPlaying down the slope in the first half, IC were soon\n1\u20140 up when Paul Garnham\nnodded a precise free kick from the soon-to-be-injured\ncaptain, Gordon Pickering, over the keeper's head. Three\nmore were to follow before\nhalf time.\nFirst, 'superstar' midfield\nplayer, Paul Heidn was given\ntoo much space in the UC penalty area; he turned quickly\nto lob the ball over the\nadvancing keeper.\nA good back-heel from\nGarnham saw John Demnite\nthrough to beat two men before\nsnoot ing none decisively. UC launched few attacks\nin this period and these all were easily dealt with by Pete\nRutty and John Hargreaves. Just\nbefore half time, Gareth\nRoberts, the Welsh wizard, shot from wide on the right of the UC penalty area to make\nit 4 - 0 to IC.U C became more aggressive\nin the second half, but IC had\nthe experienced cool of\nPickering at right back, and\nFinn is in goal to keep them\nat bay.\nAs the half progressed IC again began to get on top as knightly and Johnson pressured\nthe UC defence.\nWith ten minutes remaining,\nup popped that man, Heid n, again, to shoot nome from\n20 yards, and make the final\nscore, 5 - 0 to IC. Rugby Unbeaten run continues\nIC Extras 34 - Harlequins (5th s)16IC seconds, playing their\nfirst club opposition of the\nseason, gave a very impressive\nperformance to add to their\nrun of victories. IC lost the toss and ' Quin s choose to play against the\nwind, giving IC the advantage\nin the first half.\nThe advantage quickly\nshowed as the ball was permanently in the ' Quin s half. A series of quick passes\nput Armstrong over for a try\nin the corner. IC increased\ntheir lead when ' Quin s fumbled\na high kick and Gibson picked\nup the loose ball and dived\nover the line to make it 8\u20140.\nThe third try was similar\nto the first, Gregory scoring\nin the corner after good work\nby Dunleary. 12\u20140 at half time.\nIC then turned to face the\nwind and within5 minutes had\nadded another try from Block. From then on the play swung\nfrom end to end with teams\nscoring alternately, 3 tries\neach. The IC tries all came\nfrom good, well-supported\nbreaks and Parkinson, Siornak\nand Dunleary scored tries which\nwere converted by Gregory, to\nmake it 34 \u2014 16 at the final\nwhistle. In a fast, exciting and skilful match IC showed the\nability with which they\nhave won their first four games,\nc once e ding only 23 points while\nscoring a massive total of\n206. The forwards did particularly well against the heavier and more experienced 'Quins\npack and provided the driving\nforce for this good win by\ngiving good ball to the backs\nwho used it well and made\nstrong runs.\nTeam: Armstrong, Parkinson,\nBlock, Gibson, Gregory,\nDunleary, Howard, Zawarotko,\nFishburn, Foley, Grant,\nBrunnen, Siomiak, Farr,\nAtteck.\nMike Gibson (Capt)\nCRICKET NETS\nThroughout the winter there\nwill be cricket nets . oh Tuesday nights at Gover\nSchool Wandsworth.

This lead to a goal, just before\nhalf time, by Fat ania. The second half saw Cr an well putting their game together\nto pressure the IC defence. It\nwas this- period that won the\nday for IC, who held out\nextremely well, thus frustrating\nthe opposition. There were\nsome fine performances from\nHuck le, Cull um, Barrett and\nMc Robie. Cranwell did, however,\nmanage to so ore a hotly\ndisputed ' offside' goal. During the latter stages\nthe calmer IC midfield took over\nand good work by Sethi led to\nthe winning goal by Middleton.\n. . . and Jesus\ncrucified\nIC 4 Jesus College Oxford 3\n\u2022 After sampling the local\nale, the hats man began the\ngame in fine spirit, controlling\nthe game on a fine pitch.

The third IC goal was the\nbest, a well worked short\ncorner enabling Sethi to score. Then the beer started to take\neffect on the IC team and\nHutson was blinded by two\nincredible goals. Fortunately\nMiddleton had added another\nwith a sort of under-head hit(!!)\nto give us a justified victory.\nMUD FREE On Saturday the 16th Oct, the\nX, Country club paid its second\nvisit to Party Hill Fields. On this occasion we were to\nbe spared the agonizing five\nand a. half miles of a mud bath.\nIn its place we were to participate in a relay race consisting of 6 legs of \\Ya miles \u2014 the\nUC relay.\nIC, with the help of a few\nwelcome ' outsiders', managed\nto field 3 teams. Steve Webb\nled off for the l st team and in an extremely keen first leg did very well, putting the team in\n13th place with a run of8 mins 2 4 secs. Unfortunately\nafter this leg the 3rd team were\nahead of the 2nd( oops).\nIn face of fierce competition\nIC's l st team held onto 13th place throughout the race,\nthanks to good runs from D Rosen and GS well. The2 nd team pulled up 3 or 4 places\nto finish 33rd and the 3rd team dropping to 37th. The winners, incident ly, were\nBirmingham University.\n\n"

To overcome\nthis, a new technique has been\ndevised It consists of naming\nthe lane required by an\nappropriate politican. E.g. A four lane one way street may\nbe divided into the Michael Foot, Shirly Williams, Edward\nHeath\u00ab and Enoch Powell lanes. \" Similarly, turnings\nmight be referred to as' A quick Looney Benn'.

Unfortunately\nthe article did not include a critical appraisal of the true\nworth of the scheme.\nFor example you might\nhave to spend \u00a320 to recoup\nyour initial \u00a32 outlay. Did you know that all the theatres\ngive student discount to\nholders of any valid student\nID card? As for the hotels\nand restaurants, I have to\nlaugh at discounts there. On a grant it is difficult enough\nto afford a clean weekend, let\nalone a dirty one!\nMoreover most of the\npublications listed give the\nsame discounts to all bone fide students.\nThat covers 7 5 % of the\nlocal places listed. The only\nshops where the card would\nbe useful are ' W.H. Smith,\nClothes shops, hairdressers\nand record shops. I realise\nthat this letter gives the\nNSDS card a harsh treatment,\nthis is because I have borne\nin mind that the card is supposed to help stretch the\ngrant further. In fact the\ncard will on iy make living\ncheaper for students who can afford to buy more expensive articles than those\nstudents on a grant.\nFinally, if NUS really\nwant to make student life\nfinancially easier, then they\nought to campaign harder for\nhigher grants. Or is it because\nCharles Clarke and Co want\nto get into Parliament that\nthey kept last year's grants\ncampaign on a very low key?\nYours sincerely\nCliff Miller\nPhysics2. Dear Sir, \u2014 How kind of the\nNUS to arrange the discounts\nlisted in today's Fp LIX. The implication of your article is that you need- a National\nStudent Discount Card to\nobtain all the goods or\nservices .described; but this\nis far fr Qm the truth.\nI have been a Times reader\nfor the past nine years at the\ncheap rate and even my most\nrecent cheque from them didn't mention an NUS Card. Furthermore student discounts\nare available, certainly at\nThe National, at The Royal\nShakespeare Company\n( Aldwych)' to members of a recognised student body and\nthere is no need to offer\nNUS card.\nBy the way, why does NUS\nsuddenly feel it has to charge\nfor a service it has provided\nfree for so long?

    "content": "6 - FELIX, OCTOBER29 th1976 CHANGE OF STYLE WORKS WONDERS FOR RORY\nRory Gallagher - ' Calling Card*Chrysalis\nMany reviewers have in the past put\nRory's music down as 'predictable and\n'holding few surprises' \u2014 yet the crowds\nthat flock to see him tell a different tale\nof this down-to-earth ry th m \"iC guitarist.\nThey can't say the same about this\nLP 'cause although the Irishman has\nput his distinct stamp on al I the cuts, the\nalbum is so unlike Gallagher' s previous\nefforts. Rory has come out of the confines\nof down-the-line rock ' n' roll and produced\na diverse LP that is versatile and\nunconsciously commercial. ' Produced' is\nstrictly speaking the wrong word since\nex-Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover is\nthe accredited producer; he's done an\nexcellent job and without him the new\nstyles could have come out a lot worse.\nI find the LP difficult to review in\ndetail it's just so good, but so unexpectedly varied. From the start the music has\na greater feel to it than on previous\nGallagher LPs. The guitar/keyboard\ninterplay between Rory and Lou Martin\nhas been greatly en chanced so that there\nis more texture to the songs without the\nusual accompanying loss of feel. On the heavier 'adrenal in builder'\nnumbers, such as 'Secret Agent' and\n'Country Mile', Roger Glover has preserved\nan awful lot of clint y, bringing out the\n'new' background intricacies. On the more\npeaceful numbers both Rory and Roger\nhave ex cerci sed expert control, which\nmay well be why the LP appears so uncharacteristic of Gallagher. 'Calling\nCard', 'Edged in Blue' and ' / ' / / Admit\nYou've Gone' are all prime examples of\nthis. 'Edged' is probably the album's best\nsong. It's a beautiful number that has a vast amount of cheerful melodies in it,\nwhich is unusual for a blues player.\nOne thing I ought to mention is that\nRory's gone in for a fair amount of\noverdubbing on this LP, something\nwhich he's refrained from trying before.\nLike the album, his efforts here are\nsuccessful. To conclude, 'Calling Card' is a progressive LP in the truest sense.\nRory devotees may scorn the jumps he's made but I think they'll grow to love his\nnew direction. All in all a great album,\nbut one that's bedeviled me as a reviewer.\nI dare say it has done the same to a few\nother self-appointed music ' officia na does'. Clive Dewey\nLost over Hammersmith fly-over\nCommander Cody and hj s Lost Planet\nAirmen 'We've Got ALive One Here'Warner Bros\nTo many a would be truck driver,\nCommander C and the LP A were just\nabout the best thing to come out of the\nSouthern States since Comfort. Sadly,\nthey're no longer with us, but have left\nthe world with the best kind of epitaph\nany band could wish for.\nThe Airmen were perhaps the archetypal good-time band, that's why listening\nto this live double set, its difficult\nactually trying to write about it, instead\nall I want to do is just sit back, tap my\nfeet and get blind drunk.\nRecorded at Hammersmith, Aylsbury\nand Oxford on their last British tour, the\nalbum contains all the songs that made\nthe LP A a band that were a bit special; ranging from the late forties jazz tinged\ncountry of 'Smoke, Smoke, Smoke,' with\nthe sort of close smooth harmonies\nthat accompanied most of Roy Rodgers'\ngreat songs, the traditional country of\n'San Antonio Rose', 'Milkcow Blues' and\n'My Window Faces the South', the rockabilly feel of 'Hot Rod Lincoln', Too\nMuch Fun' and 'Lost in the Ozone', and of\ncourse, the truck dr iv in' songs. No one\ncould play this stuff quite like the Airmen.\nBe it tongue in cheek weepies Jike\n'Mama Hated De is els, to the dr iv in'18 Wheels' or Lookin' Through the World\nThrough a Windscreen'.\nEverything that those stoned Texas croon ies stood for is recorded for\nprosperity on this album. The last thing\nthe Commander and his men would want\nanybody to do is write paragraphs\nany ly sing their music. They were all about having a good time, which is\nexactly what this album gives you. Ian Morse\nLACK OF COHESION DOGS REVAMPED STRAWBS\nThe Strawbs - 'Deep Cuts' Polydor\nSuper\nI used to be a great Strawbs fan back\nin 1972 when they were on A&M Records\nand turning out delights such as 'Grave\nNew World'. That was before the\nHudson-Ford split and just before Dave\nLambert joined the band.\nThe per nen ni al Dave Cousins and Mr\nLambert are the only two remnants of\nthat .era on ' Cuts'. The album features\ntheir* lovely bouncy hit single \u2022'/ Only\nwant My Love To Grow In You', and to\nmy knowledge is their first effort for\nOyster Records (distributed by Polydor).\nThe rest of the album is generally\ndisappointing except for two numbers\n'Simple Visions', which opens side two,\nand 'Turn Me Round'. The other numbers\nare either uni spire d acoustic copies of\nold 'Strawb-type' music or rather cluttered\nheavier tracks.\nTake 'Charmer', for instance; it opens\nwith a headstrong a 'nd heavy passage f fiat goes into a rather bland bubblegum\nditty that won't endear them to many\na customer. Half the album is likewise second-rate.\nThe main trouble seems to be an\nabsence of cohesion between the band\nmembers, who individually are capable\nThumbs down here too\nThe Average White Band - Soul Searching (Atlantic)\n...And speaking of the AWB, their\nlatest offering does leave a few doubts,\nin it's wake. It starts off just dandy, with\na nifty little into r duct ion by the name of\n'overture', and then in are led the Average\nWhite patented wailing brass back beat disco-musics of ' Love you- life' and\n'I'm the one'. All very good tried and\ntested mannerisms- (they must have\nshares in the patent it office). James\nBrown has trodden the path of repetition\nand even he, the minister of new superheavy fun i, has suffered for it. How\ncan de ese me rely-mortal honk ies hope\nto survive?-This album has received a fairly\nwidespread thumbs-down from the music\npapers but, in all fairness, it's not as\nbad as-they make out. Anything the AWB release will be compared with the White\nalbum that broke them into the big boys\nleague. That was an inspired piece af\nmusic-making on Atlantic plastic and it's not fair to constantly compare their\nproduct with it's excellence. 'Soul\nsearching' _y normal standards is a good\nalbum. As with the 'Moon' LP no effort\nor expense has been spared in it's production and rec ocd ing, Hamish\nStuart's voice is back in form, the brass-work is tight with the rhythm-section\napparently recovered from the loss of\nRobbie Mcintosh, and .again Arif Mardin\nproduces. So it's all really down to the\nstrength of the songs. They're not bad,\nsimply not as good as those that have\ngone before.\nA multitude of session ers have joined\nthe Scottish sextet (apologies to Steve\nFerrone) for the venture. The BrecKers\nand Marvin Stamm add their metro no mic sax/trumpet muscle to the already\nformidable powers of Roger Ball and\nof great things, but don't pull together\nmost of the time. The group seem to be\npec ve ying too many musical styles. Despite this the harmonies are generally\nvery good and some of the Dave Lambert's guitar breaks deserve better material.\nHe' s particularly good on 'SimpleVisions',\nwhere Dave Cousins manages, at long\nlast, to get some Duckhams to his\ncroak y vocals. The track pounds along\nquite well, and with a bit of editing could\nmake a good single. A general thumbs\ndown although some of the lyrics are\nreally quite good.\nClive Dewey\n\" Mollie\" Duncan, while ex-koko moi d Jim Mul len applies his axe work on 'Sunny Days'\netc, etc, etc.\nIt's around the second half of side Two that the proceedings start to sound a little lame. 'Everybody's darling' just\nstands around filling in space and on\n'Would you stay' the band out-do the\ncountless US soul combos who churn out\nthis boring old dirge in their sleep. It's bluesy soul arriving about ten years too\nlate for the interview, and asking for the\njob. They can do much better.\nWhen the AWB write a good song or\nriff they normally extend it into a long\nrhythmic or vocal spree. Now, although\nthey're currently only writing ordinary\nsongs, they still try the same gambit,\nresulting in a long, ordinary song with\nvocal or rhythmic excesses ad nausea.\nResult: boredom.\nWhat the three-pound-plus paying\npunter is left with then is one good\nside, well up to scratch, and a couple of\nso-so tracks on side two. The rest does\nthe average White's hard-earned reputation\nno good at all. Shame, that.\n\n"

The trouble is its too small and has little or no atmosphere to make prospective\nclient el flock to the place in great numbers. Prices though,\ncompared to Dingwalls and the other late night gig at the Speakeasy are much cheaper. Lager is40 pas opposed to the 52p at\nDingwalls or the (gulp!) 60p at the Speakeasy.

If you've any of your grant left, you might\nwant to check it out.\nThe Four Tops make a rare London appearence at Hammersmith\nOdeon on Saturady, so too do those ex-patriots Climax Chicago,\nwho play a hastily arranged concert at the Victoria Palace.

The news came in ate tter this\nweek from the Vice Chancellor, Professor Paul Mathews (head\nof IC's Physics department\ntill September) telling student\nunion president Stuart Appleton that ' the equities to which the\nstudent union objected have\nbeen sold'. Sum Trouble\nMaths students are less well prepared for university courses\nthan they used to be, concludes\nthe vice chancellors' committee\n( C.V.C. P.). The trouble is that\nthe wider range of the\ncirri cul um at school results in less specialised mathematical\nknowledge. (Report from the\nTimes Higher Education\nSupplement).\nBraille Calculator\nA braille calculator has been developed at West\nVirginia Un iver is it y.. It will perform most standard calculator\nfunctions, including arithmetic,\nlogarithmic, exponential and\ntrigonometric operations, (report\nform THES)\nNUS Nursery Report\nOnly 59 out of 821 institutions\nof higher education provide\nnursery facilities, according to\na new NUS report \u2014 in other\nwords there are only 2,000\nplaces for the children of\n5,000 parent students. Out of\n84 universities only 31 provide\nany form of day care, and fees are not standardised. Kent\nand UEA have the best facilities, and a new nursery is likely to\nopen at Cambridge next year.\nDES Threat to OU .Research\nPlans to extend the research\nwork at the Open University to\na similar level to other\nuniversities in Britain may have\nto. be put aside owing to the\nlack.' of government subsides.( THE S). Lancaster AUT Attacks\n\u2022 \"Sit-in Convention\"\nThe Lancaster branch of .the\nAssociation of University Teachers attacked the* AUT/ NUS's\" s it in convention\"( see last week's \"Student\nWorld\") as unrepresentative\nand collaborationist.\nAstronomical Cut-backs\nPublic expenditure cuts and\nthe rise in subscriptions to\ninternational scientific organ\niz at ions-threaten to reduce the\nScience Research Council's budget to one sixth less in real\nterms in1980 than in1973, according to the council's annual report. Cutbacks by the\nS RC will affect its nuclear\nphysics programmes (from \u00a341\nmillion to \u00a329.5 million pa) and\nits space research (from \u00a326\nmillion to \u00a320 million) and\nuniversity education and\nresearch may ultimately be hit, despite initial plans to increase\nexpenditure in these fields. A saving of nearly \u00a3Vi million could be made by a suggested\nclosing of the two particle\naccelerators, Nina( at the\nDaresbury Laboratories) and\nNimrod (at the Rutherford\nLaboratories). Although N in a's closure had already been\nplanned, the closure of Nimrod\nwould harm research on the new\nparticle for the discovery of\nwhich Professors Burton\nRichter and Samuel Ting were\nthis week awarded the Nobel\nPrize. FEE FEARS As some of you will already\nknow the government plans to\nraise the fees for home and\noverseas undergraduates from\n\u00a3182 and \u00a3416 pa respectively\nto \u00a3650, and to raise post-grad fees from \u00a3250 to \u00a3750.\nThis staggering rise is unlikely to affect the home\nstudent, living on alea grant,\nbut will hit overseas students\nand the estimated 10,000\npostgraduates (chiefly scientists) dependent on industrial\nsubsidies, and is likely to\nresult in a decline in their\nnumbers.\nThe plans have provoked\nopposition from the Committee\nof Vice Chancellors and Principals, the Council of\nLocal Education Authorities\nand the Association of University Teachers. A proposed\nincrease in hall fees for\noverseas students at the\nPolytechnic of Central London\nhas been attacked in a strongly-worded article in\" McG are l\", the Poly' s student paper, on the grounds of its racial discrimination.\nLetters\n(Continued from page 9)\nyears. History has shown that\nindividuals have only been\neffective when acting as groups.\nI do not see this changing in the near future, and to suppose\nthat things are otherwise, runs\nthe risk of putting all your eggs\nin one basket. In order to\nact as a group, the first thing\nis to decide what needs to be\ndone. This implies reasoned\ndebate. Most people, after all, are undecided over issues until they have talked them over\nwith several other people with\nwith different-view points. The U GM is the place to do this.\nThe second thing we must do\nand the most important of all, having decided on our position\nis act in ways to forward our\ncase. Mr Williams has said that\nwe (Soc, Soc) are cut off from\nthe major i tory of students at\nIC. So we are: they don't come\nto UG M's. For Gods sake,\neveryone come. Say what you want perhaps then something\ncan be done.\nSocialist Society. Mr Benn mingles with the\naudience after his talk al\nMore House.\nEnergv Secretary, Tony Wedgewood Benn, visited More\nHouse (Cromwell Road) last\nSunday to give a talk on\n' Democracy'. He outlined the\nhistoric development of the\nConservative and Labour\nparty ideas of ballot-box\ndemocracy in a mixed market\neconomy.\nHis visit came at the\ninvitation of the West London\nCatholic Chaplin cy, of which\nIC Cath soc is a part.\nMr Benn went on to describe\nhis thoughts on Capitalism, unfair to workers and, he\nreckoned, a failure \u2014 and\nIndustrial Democracy, in which he believes workers must\nparticipate in management.\nHis principle is that no one\ngroup or class should dominate\nthe people at large. Furthermore\nJhe individual must be guided\nby his conscience, says Mr\nBenn, even if this leads him to flout the law.. All the same\nthe individual must be prepared\nto pay for following their\nconscience. Tony Wedgewood Benn voiced support for the Labour\nmovement and parliament ry democracy. The latter might not\nbe a very good system, he said, but it was the best available, and at least it allows workers\nto change the Government\nwithout a revolution.\n\n"

This was\nconfirmed by Richard Silver,\nUniversity of London Union\n( UL U) President.\nUp till this year Sennet had\nreceived a grant from GP C, equivalent to a Science\nResearch Council Post Graduate grant. This was to\nsustain a sabbatical editor.\nArrangements are now\ndifferent and the paper gets\na loan from GP C,a proportion\nof which has to be repaid\neach week. Sennet still gets\nits offices within the UL U Building free of charge, but\nSennet executives have to\nreport each week to Mr Silver\non the paper's financial\nhealth.\nIn the short-term neither\nRichard Silver nor Anne\nTudor see the paper's non-appearance affecting its\naffecting business confidence\nin it.\nHowever, Anne Tudor does\nsee problems in the future,\n'After Christmas London\ncould be without its own\nstudent paper.' She feels that\n'certain other student publications that have come on\nthe advertising scene' causing Sennet's revenue to drop. On\nthe other hand Richard Silver\nsees problems ahead should\nNational Student come out\nmore regularly.\nAction to counter decreasing\nrevenue is already being\ndrawn up by Sennet staff and\nMascot wrangles\nAllegations are flying\nbetween the RCS and C&G Union offices following an\nabortive attempt by Guilds to\nsteal RCS's mascot, Theta, at\nthe Mathematics Fresher's dinner on Tuesday.\nThe mascot raid came just\nbefore the start of the dinner,\nas Theta was being driven to\nlevel one Sherfield Building in\na JR van. As the van approached\nthe building two Guildsmen\nblocked the entrance into the\ndinner. Guilds then claim that\nwhen the ,14 doors were opened\nthey were more people in the\nvan than expected, so the raid\nwas called off.\nRCS tell a different tale.\nThey say that the Guildsmen\nwere caught between two\nfactions of scientists and a fracas developed. C& GU\nrefute that their members\nwere involved in this fight,\nbut admit that Guildsheet\neditor John Elkin thought that\nhis buddies were- in trouble.\nMr Elkin drove his car at\nthe gathering mob at the\nentrance to the Sherfield\nBuilding. Here he was surrounded by the mob and his ignition\nkeys removed. Although the\nfracas continued, say RCS,\nTheta was successfully passed\nover the bonnet of Mr Elkins\ncar into the dinner.\nNo-one was seriously hurt,\nalthough two RCS fresher s received cuts to their legs'\nduring the incident. One\nTheta bearer was pinned\nto the wall of the Sherfield\nBuilding by the car, thus\nsustaining bruises to his legs.\nMr Elkin drove off using a spare set of keys.\nRCS election\nKathy Taylor, a third year\nLife Scientist, was this week\nelected as RCS Union Honorary\nJunior Treasurer.

In a half-hour STOIC discussion broadcast to IC students, live (at 1pm) and recorded (at 6pm), the main\nissue was whether the shortcomings of NUS finances\njustified the formation of an alternative union that would\nbreak student solidarity in the\nface of government cutbacks. \"The student movement needs\nto be united,\" said Mr Silver,\nwhilst Mr Martini-Brown described NUSa san \"inefficient\nbusiness machine.\"\nMr Martini-Brown claimed that the NUS executive was quite unrepresentative of the\nviews of the student majority,\nand accused it of supporting\nthe IRA and of being more\nradical than the TUC in its opposition to wage-restraint\npolicy. \"Students should have\na perfect right of choice of\ntheir national union,\" he said, and emphasised that BSA aims\nat individual response before\ncorporate affiliation. \"The\nBSA has no political position\nat all,\" he said. A practical issue was raised about the possible effects of a genuinely democratic election of NUS officers.\n\"Professional student\npoliticians\" would be the\nresult, according to Mr Silver, and this to him was undesirable.\nWhen asked about the city\nbusiness sub sid is ers of the\npirate. union, Mr MartiniBrown assured that there were\nno strings attacked, and that\nBSA would be internally\nfunded within three years.\nGuilds Silly Sports\n>\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n>\n\u2022>\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<\u2022>\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022>\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022> \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER29 th19767 Lesser characters shine through\nThomas Stevenson takes a look at the\nYoung Vic Theatre.\nThe Young Vic, in The Cut near\nWaterloo Station, was founded in 1970 as\na branch of the National Theatre, then\noccupying the nearby Old Vic. Since then\nthe National has moved into its beautiful\nnew home and the Young Vic has become\nindependent under its original director\nFrank Dun lop. The theatre is designed\nto serve a young audience; the seats\nare cheap and hard and the dec/or is\nstrictly functional. The audience sits on\nred-stained benches around three sides of\nthe stage giving an intimate actor-audience relationship.\nThe autumn season opened recently\nwith Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra,\ndirected by Frank Dunlop. Although the\nprogramme notes have no hesitation in\ntelling us that this is one of the greatest\npoems ever written, this production\nconcentrates on the actions rather than\nthe words. This is hardly surprising when\nyou have a French Cleopatra, Delphine\nSeyrig, admittedly with a fine command of\nEnglish, who has some difficulty with the\nverse, and an Antony in Michael Graham\nCox, who does not have sufficient range\nto reach the anger of the battlefield.\nThat said, the production concentrates\nadmirably on the lesser characters.\nGeoffrey Hutchings delights as the tipsy\nLepidus in the famous drunken scene,\nwhilst Alfred Lynch' s Enobarbus has all \u2022\nthe heroics that Antony lacks. There is\nan excellent clarity and haste which\nmust appeal to the primarily adolescent\naudience. Carl Toms' ski slope set\nproves sometimes tre che rous to the cast\nand gives more the impression of an\nEgyptian desert than of the private\npalaces of Rome and Egypt in which so much of the play is set.\nIn repertoire with Antony and Cleopatra is Robert Bolt's A Man For All\nSeasons. This is the famous account of\nSir Thomas More's stubborn conscience resisting the birth of the established\nChurch of England. Its director, Stewart\nTrotter, won the HM -Tennent Award for\nthe best production outside the West End\nwith his version of The Browning\nVersion by Sir Terrence Rattigan. This production suffers from a spectacular\npiece of mis-casting with Alfred Lynch\nas More, looking like nothing so much\nas one of Norfolk's water spaniels. It\nis surely a mistake in this intimate theatre\nto rely so heavily on make-up for an\nactor to appear what he is not.\nMichael Graham Cox' s Comman Man,\non the other hand, is perfect. He takes\nin the assortment of bit parts; steward,\nboatman, publican, jury foreman and\nstory-teller, with consummate ease and\nbuilds up an engaging relationship with\nthe audience, taking no side in the\nargument but leading us through the\ncomplexities of the sixteenth century.\nFinally, be warned that both these\nplays may be ' O' level texts and the\naudience might consist of four hundred\nschoolgirls who find the speech of\nCleopatra's eunuch, Mardian, ir rest i stably funny. I look forward to their November\nproduction of a Stoppard double-bill with\ninterest.\nNo placelessness nor timelessness\nAt the National Thomas Stevenson\nAleksei Arbuzov is one of Russia' s most popular current playwrights; his\nplay Tanya, written in 1938,has apparently\nalways been in performance somewhere in\nthe Soviet Union. Old World, which joined\nthe Royal Shakespeare Company's repertoire at the Aldwych last week is\npresently playing fifty theatres in\nRussia. And yet, apart from names and obvious\nreferences there is nothing particularly\nRussian about this play. Both characters\nhave been strongly affected by the war\nbut despite their heavy losses this is\nnot a timelessness and placelessness even though the author tries hard to\nfix us in Riga in August 1968. Perhaps\nin the Soviet Union the play's production\ncan be slanted to present two individuals\nin a brief escape from a collective life,\nbut not in London WC2.\nAnthony Quayle and Peggy Ashcroft\nplay the two characters \u2014 a doctor and\nhis patient at a Sanatorium. She has come\nfrom Moscow, where she works in a circus. He, a widower of twenty years\nstanding, is a slightly bitter misogynist\nawaiting a visit from his daughter who\nlives in Japan. In his beautifully constructed play their pasts are gradually\nunfolded and a tenderness develops\nwhich culminates in a scene at the\ndoctor's wife's grave in a military\ncemetery.\nPeggy Ashcroft, looking remarkably\nyoung for all her years, performs with a gay abandon which would do credit to a woman half her age. At the resta urn at where they have been to show off. her\ndaring Moscow fashion they perform a slightly drunken dance with great care\nand, in a cracked voice she sings one\nof her old circus songs. Anthony Quayle\nis no less endearing as he sucks the\nsweets which for the past twenty years\nhave helped him to give up smoking/\nRalph Kol ta i's settings admirably set\nof the performance. Patients, passers-by\nand restaurant patrons are represented\nby grey sculpted figures which give an\nunobtrusive impression life going on\naround them.\npageant of kings passes across the\nstage, each to be defeated by deceit or\nby force of numbers.\nYet we never see a single battle.\nBy convention the con bat ants meet before-hand, then thundering drums and very\ni effective lighting depict the battle and\nMeanwhile, on the other side of\nWaterloo Bridge, the National Theatre's main auditorium \u2014 the Olivier Theatre \u2014\nhas opened with a long overdue production\nof Christopher Marlowe's epic Tamburlalne\nThe Great. And what a production to\nopen this magnificent theatre! With a cast of fifty the play shows the conquest\nof the world from Europe to Persia by a Persian shepherd who never loses. A Renaissance at the New Victoria Theatre\n(17th October)\nRenaissance music is rather unique;\nthey produce graceful neoclassical tunes\nthat often embody a great depth of feeling.\nThey're very much akin to Peter Frampton\nin that they're a British group who've\nmade it big in the US and who are only\njust reap ping some success over here.\nLast Sunday was indeed entertaining,\nmarred only slightly at the end by a lack\nof concentration or sincerity during bits\nof 'Mother Russia', the group's tribute to\nAlexander Sol zenit syn, and 'The Song Of\nScheherazade'.\nBarring that the group were in good\nform from the start, as were the knowledgeable audience. Their report oi re( the\ngroup's spanned three studio LPs,' Ashes Are Burning', 'Turn of the Cards' and\nScheherazade And Other Stones'. 'Can\nYou Understand', from the first of these,\nopened the 90-minute set. Like so many\nof their songs the melodic tones of\nAnnie Has lem kept well above the er rie and scintillating instrumental background\nA frivolous number 'Carpet of The\nSun' followed and then Annie too took\nTumburlaine returns victorious once\nagain.\nAlbert Finney is Tamburlaine, a part\nwhich suits him perfectly; at first the\nsinewy shepherd dealing brusquely with\nhis enemies and then the ageing widower\ncruel in his tyranny. His wife, Zenocrate,\nplayed by Susan Fleetwood, is the only\ninfluence he will accept, and it is duly\nher pleading that will save her father,\nthe only victim to be spared.\nChief amongst Tamburlaine's adversaries is Baja ze th, Emperor of Turkey,\nwho arrives in great magnificence,\naccompanied by his queen. In art amusing\nscene Baj eze th, played by Dennis Qui I ley,\nand Tamburlaine try to out do each other\nin the dreadful ness of their treatment of\nv anguished. Bajazeth finally kills himself by beating his brains out on th* bars of the tiny cafe in which Tamburlaine\nhas secured him.\nThe verse speaking is excellent and\nthe fast pace is kept up throughout the\nfour hours which the play lasts.\nThe new theatre is superb. Although\nthe audience is arranged in a180 \u00b0 arc\naround the stage, the two side blocks\nare raised so th dt there is no feeling of\nbeing in a vast sea of heads.The auditorium\nis so steeply raked that you are almost\nunconscious of anyone sitting in front\nof you. We have yet to see, however,\nwhat the much vaunted versatile\nmachinery will do.\non an eerie_ facade for 'Ocean Gypdfy'.\nThe more conventional 'Running Hard'\nwas next up, and this, together with\n'Gypsy' really goes to show why John\nTout is one of the two lynchpins of\nRenaissance, Annie being the other. He\ndominates the band's music with a varied set of keyboard and synthesizer\nnoises that are oft gradually built into\na dear cacophony of engrossing sounds.\nExcept for the two aforementioned\ntracks the evening went extremely well; the group were called back for the now\nobligatory encore of 'Ashes Are Burning',\nending as usual with a spectacular mirror-ball lighting effect. Annie' s voice bounced around the theatre and then\nthey were gone.\n\n"
