Rumour has it that\n'The Phoenix,' then known as the\n'Science Schools Journal.' was\nfounded b) HG Wells, the early\nscience fiction author, whilst he was\nat the Royal College of Science\nstudying zoology. 'The Phoenix'\nperformed the same function then\nas \"Felix\" does now. to inform the\nCollege and by so doing giving it\na sense of identity, and though 'the\nPhoenix' still exists, coming out\nannually, it now contains the\nliterary efforts of the College staff\nA play in Three Acts, and an\nEpilogue.\nPlace: The Organic Laboratory.\nACT I ACID. Lady Esther But allyl lies\nimprisoned in a round-bottomed\nflask. In her rage she assails a piece\nof porous earthenware. The flask\ntrembles at the impact. She sighs\nruefully, and calls unto her faithful\nRations. ' Go forth.\" quoth she. 'in\nquest of my well-beloved Prince.\nAl Khali. Bid him come hither in\nPages from Phoenix\nSAPON\nall haste, for I know not this evil\ndemon who devour eth my side.\"\n(Exeunt the Rations with much\nfrothing.)\nACT II - NEUTRAL. The noble Lord Al-Khali enters\nthrough a reflux condenser at the\nhead of his army of anions. They\nfight the demon desperately. For a while things look very black, then\nthey look brown, then red. then\nyellow, green and finally\nopalescent. 'Forsooth, my well-beloved.' sighs Esther, 'though hast\ncomforted me. Thy very presence\ninspire th me with confidence;\ngladly will I take thee as my wedded\nhusband.'\n(Exit the demon, fuming.)\nSome of the\nchoicer excerpts\nfrom the\n'Phoenix' of\n1922. Oh, the\ntragedy when an\neditor has to\npilfer the past to\nfill up the\npages.\n/MJ and students. This year's Phoenix\nwill be edited by Phillip Henry and\nentries should be handed in to the\nFelix Office, Beit Quad, as soon as\npossible.\nFollowing are excerpts from 'The\nPhoenix' of 1922-23, under the\neditorship of Mr B. Drinkwater\n( B.Sc. F.I. C..A.R.S. M..A.R.C. S). Bear in mind the outside\nworld - Europe was four years out\nof one of the most hideous wars\nmankind had ever inflicted on itself\nand Imperial College had certainly\nlost many people in it. There was\na general air of pulling-things-together and smiling-in-the-face-of-adversity, which is often reflected\nin the writing of the time.\nIt is interesting to note the writing\nstyle. We live in a pictorially literate\nage; we are used to images, be it\ntelevision or full colour newspaper\npictures. In 1922 they had no such\ndiversions and all images had to be\nbroadcast through the pen. This led\nto sentences which, by today's standards, are immensely long,\ncontorted and picturesque.\nA NEW EXAMINATION PAPER To the Editor ofTHE PHOENIX students.\nDEAR SIR,\nIt is felt that the usual\nExamination papers do not give full\nscope for individuality and\nobservation, and so. failing the\nadoption universally of a ph reno logical test. I append the\nfollowing test-paper, based on the\ncourse work of a student.\nI am. Yours etc.,\nEDUCATIONIST.

As this\norganisation is of recent foundation,\na brief statement as to its origin and\nobjects will not be out of place.\nAt the re-opening in 1919 of the\nUniversity of Strasbourg, a French\nInstitution, representatives from the\nUniversities of Allied and ex-neutral countries were invited in\norder to discuss International\nStudent relations.\nThis led to the foundation shortly\nafterwards, of the Confederation\nInternationale des Etudiants. most\nEuropean countries, with the\nexception of the Central Powers.\njoining immediately.\nUnfortunately. England had no\norganisation which could claim to\nrepresent the Students of this\ncountry, and so the English\nStudents were merely allowed to\nattend the meetings in an unofficial\ncapacity and could not vote.\nThis difficulty was again\nexperienced at the First CLE. Congress held at Prague in 1921.\nwhen Scotland, whose Students\nwere officially represented joined\nthe Confederation independently.\nThe result of this Conference was\nthe formation of the National Union\nof Students in February. 1922.\nMost of the Universtities in the\ncountry affiliated immediately, and\nnow after less than one year, every\nUniversity and University College\nin the country, with one exception,\nis represented on the N.U.S. Council.\nThe objects of the N.U.S. are 'the\nnational and international\nrepresentation of the Students of this\ncountry.' In view of the present\nchaotic state of affairs in Europe,\nit is important that students should\nhave some knowledge of the\nconditions and life of other\nnationalities with a view to a better\nmutual understanding in the future.\nThe fact that the Imperial College\nhas joined independently has been\ninstrumental in bringing to the\nnotice of other Universities the\nposition and aims of the College,\nand it is of the greatest importance\nthat the Imperial College should not\nbe missing from a movement that\nevery other University in the\ncountry is taking part.\nW Randerson and FG Connor,\nextracts from the January 1923\nissue.\nACT III - ALKALINE. There is much rejoicing; the\nkat ions and the anions give a wonderful display of tau tom eric dances.

The date of consecration\nis not yet fixed.\nExtract from t lie May 1923 issue.\nWe have received a letter\nexpressing not a little\ndisappointment at the omission\nfrom the Memorial Tablets, shortly\nto be unveiled in the Colleges, of\nthe names of those of the\n\"subordinate staff\" (cleaners,\nlabourers and the like), who fell in\nthe common cause. We cannot see\nthat such distinction need to be\ndrawn, and consider the grievance\na legitimate one. Perhaps it is even\nnow not too late to do something in\nthe matter.\nEditorial extract. February 1922\n\\ letter reached us a few days back\naddressed to \"The Editor of the\nFelix Magazine.\" We regret to have\nlo say that, judged by comparison\nw ith previous Sessions, our position\nlo-day hardly justifies such a title\nin fact, we may say that hardly\nsince the post-War resumption of publication we have felt less 'felix.'\nWhether or not we have submerged\nin the general depression it is\nimpossible to say; the fact remains\nthat our 'grip' on our readers, at no\ntime a very fixed quantity, has\nrelaxed to an alarming extent.\nTowards the end of 1921. we were\nbeginning to say 'Every day. and in\neven way. we are ... etc' The\nreception of our Christmas Number, however, considerably\ndented our optimism, and our\nenthusiasm has waned steadily\nsince. Briefly, then, the facts are\nthese:- the number of individuals\nwriting for our Magazine more or\nless regularly scarcely reaches 20,\nwhile in the matter of sales it is a great struggle to make ends meet.\nAnd this is a College boasting at\nleast a thousand students. Our only\nconsolation, if such it be, lies in the\nfact that a glance here and there at\nother 'activities' shows them to be\nin much the same unsatisfactory\nposition. There is an air of general\napathy afoot (if we may so put it).\nTo improve matters somewhat,\ntherefore, we have reduced the\nnumber of pages in the issue, and\nregret that several articles and\nnotices of books have been held\nover.\nEditorial extract, May 1922.\nSomeone has remarked, in what the\nnewspaper reporter in var i bly terms\na few well chosen words,\" the\ntendency of young man's fancy at\nthis period of the year. A short time\ntime since our post-pr an dial sauntering led us through ther\nBrompton Churchyard, where we\nobserved a man and maid in earnest\nconsultation. The words referred to\nabove flashed across our recollection. Here, surely, was\nmaterial confirmation of the\nstatement. Our path took us past the\ncouple. What she said will perhaps\nnever be known - in any case it is\nnot evidence. His reply reached her\nand us almost simultaneously. It\nwas ' Yes, dear, if you are on the\nsame wave-length.' We tell this\nstory, which is \"Nothing but the\nTruth.' as indicating the firm hold\nwhich today's Ruling Passion has\nupon the community. We note the\nerection of a workmanlike aerial on\nthe Union premises. Is this a foretaste when lectures will be\ndelivered by the Staff, cosi lyes cons ed in armchairs in the Botany\nBay. to the Students, similarly\ndisposed in the main building? The\nsystem wil possess undisputed\nadvantages - to the student, who\nwill leave the lecture at will without\ndisturbing the speaker, and to the\nlecturer, who will no longer need\nto conceal the source of his\ninformation. Thus will Humanity\nun ostentatiously enter into\nEducation, on both sides.\nEditorial extract, Mcrch 1923.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 924 31 January 1992\nCredit that\nDear Adam.\n'A Very Select Committee'\n1 suppose that our sophisticated\nstudents need little guidance on the\ncredence to be placed upon\nstatements by Members of Parliament, but your report last\nweek on the student loan issue \"his\ndaughter had got it within 24 hours\nof application in Nottingham...It\nwas suggested that the delay was\ndue to College processes', must\nsurely raise a credulous eyebrow.\nThe Registry's involvement in\nstudent loans is to confirm a student's eligibility for a loan\u2014i.e. that the student is under 50. aUK student on a designated course, and\nthat the required date about bank\naccount numbers etc has been\nentered on the eligibility form\ncorrectly by the student. In order\nthat we can provide this\nconfirmation we have to inspect\nparticular bits of documentation,\ne.g. birth certificate. LEA Award\nletter, passport etc.\nWhen the eligibility certificate is\ncompleted we keep two copies, and\ntwo copies are taken by the student\nwho goes away and decides whether\nor not to pursue an application for\na loan. We keep one copy of the\neligibility certificate for our records\n-and despatch the other copy to the\nCosmopolitan\nStudent Loans Company in\nGlasgow.\nEligibility certificates are posted\nby Registry to Glasgow after every\nday's interviewing has been\ncompleted i.e. within 24 hours of\nthe interview. Nothing else happens\nuntil the student actually applies\ndirect to the S LC. If everything is in order the S LC reckon on 21 days to get the money\ninto a student's account. But as the\nofficial blurb says \"Once the\nCompany has received your\napplication form and a matching\nconfirmation from your college thai\nyou are eligible, it will draw up a formal loan agreement and send it\nto you. The agreement will include\nan authorisation for a direct debit\nto be made from your account after\nyou leave your course in order to\nrepay the loan. You should sign this\nagreement and return it to the\nCompany. Payments will then be\ncredited directly into your account.'\nSo the 24 hours claim is\nnonsense. The S LC promise 21\ndays if everything goes well. And no money will appear until the\napplication form has gone in and the\nagreement form signed and returned\nto the S LC. Yours sincerely.\nP.E. Mee.\nDear Adam.\nThought you might like to know\nthat International Night is again-around the corner. This year.\nInternational Night is being held on\nFriday 28th February and we\npromise lots of food, fun and\nentertainment.\nThe highlight of the evening is the\ncultural show with traditional\ndances and music. We need all\nthose out there with hidden talents\nto come forward. There will be a meeting on Tuesday 4th February\n1992 ( EE. Room 403, 12.30pm). Otherwise, please contact me via\nmy pigeonhole before the 7th Feb.\nThanks a lot!\nYours sincerely.\nNee Phua. Maths II. OSC\nEvents' Officer.\nThe mouse that roared\nDear Sir.\nPlease may I congratulate the\nperson or persons responsible for\nthe new security system operating\nin the Union Building on\nWednesday and Friday evenings. I was so pleased to hear that the\nviolent incidents perpetrated last\nterm by IC students had sparked a re-evaluation of the security\nmeasures.\nThe new policy of allowing\nstudents into the building only after\nproducing a valid Union membership card will obviously\ndeter the vandals and hooligans who\nare from outside College\u2014i.e. none\nof them. And the policy of having\nto sign guests in will enable those\ncausing trouble to be identified and\nbanned from a Union Building that\nthey would never have visited again\nanyway. What a stroke of genius,\ndon't you agree?\nOn a more serious note, after the\nincident on Friday the 17th January,\nin which several students\ndismantled a piano and a sabbatical\nwas banned from the building due\nto irresponsible behaviour, we\nought to keep the new system if\nonly as a source of great amusement\nto those of us who haven't been\nsucked into the complex power\npolitics of a students' union. May\nI also suggest that Mr Steve\nNew house, duty officer on\nWednesday evenings, have the\nwording on his identification card\nchanged from 'authorised to enter\nany area' to 'authorised to enter any\nanal passage belonging to a senior\nmember of the Union and lick\nentirely clean\". I hope to God he\ndoesn't stand for a sabbatical\nposition!\nPours faithfully.\nChristopher Adams.\nManagement Science.\nLobo to me\nDear Adam.\nOn reading the review of Don't Tell Her It's Me by A Gerbil in\nBloated Sheep's Clothing (Felix\nIn-joke\nThe two main Union activities\ncropping up this term (as being\nhonorary secretary goes) are\nElections and Colours.\nElections shouldn't need too\nmuch of an explanation.

Where were you?\nAnyway, we had a great time. I can remember that much. And the\nlead singer had a truly disgusting\nshirt on. I can remember that too.\nI just can't seem to remember that\nmuch about the concert. I remember being filmed during one\nsong, possibly the an the mic single,\nArclight. I remember being frozen\nstiff for the first hour or so. I remember thinking they were better\nat Reading. I remember Reading\nquite well. I remember enjoying\nmyself. I just don't remember that\nmuch about the actual performance.\nIt was good though. I know that.\nLise Yates\nHaving finally recovered from\nplaying IC. Pele release their\nsecond single. In comparison to\nRaid The Palace, and their live\nperformances, this is more\nrestrained, with none of the\nformer's vitriol, none of its anti-aristocracy rant. I think it's just\nabout a relationship. I had expected\nmore.\nAnd if the debut single can get\nplay listed on Radio One for five\nweeks and not chart, I can't see this\nchanging that. Of course, this\nmeans that now I 've said this, it will\ngo to number one lor three years.\nGo on. wind me up. buy it. see if\n1 care.\nLise Yates\nThey're nor fat, they're not ladies. They can sing.\nKingmaker - ULU\nWhen our illustrious music editor\ntold me he could get me into a Kingmaker gig free I jumped at the\nchance. The chance for a night\naway from \" Munich Philharmonic\nplays Abba\" would lead me to go\nand see a small, squeaky Australian\nby the name of Minogue if it was\nfree! Well, maybe I wouldn't go\nthat far. but I like Kingmaker so I jumped at the chance.\nFirst up. Blab Happy. The free CD single that I got with my Kingmaker\ntop had a lovely picture of the band\non the front. The CD itself is blue\nand red. Quite natty really. Haven't listened to it yet. Anyway, back to\nthe gig. For a second support, they\nwere really very good, plenty of\npeople took an interest. They had\na good range of songs, and once\nthey've ironed out the rough edges,\nthey'll make a very good live band.\nSensitize. Well all I can say is that\nErmintrude the cow would probably\nsay 'It all sounds a bit same y to me.'\nAnd it did to me too. All the songs\nseemed to run into each other. I was\nkept interested by the stage diver who managed to push the guitarist\ninto the drum kit, causing a minor\namount of mayhem. Apart fr of rj that, nothing special.\nOn to Kingmaker. I'm trying not\nto be biased because I like them, so\nhere goes. They were brilliant.\nOnly a year since their first e.p. and\nthey are selling out UL U. Not bad,\neh? Every time I listen to 'Really\nScrape the Sky' I am amazed by the\nbass line. And the drumming. Well\nthat just has to be seen to be\nbelieved. They played a hour long\nset made up of songs from their\ncurrent (only!) album and a few\n'oldies' from previous EP's. topped\noff with an encore that finished with\nThe Pockets of St. Malachi'. which\nalways leaves the crowd gasping for\nbreath.\nWhen I listen to them, I often try\nto describe the sound. And I don't usually get very far. One of their\nsongs sounds a bit U2\\sh, but that\nshouldn't put you off. The rest of\nthem don't. Tonto\nWorld Of Twist\n- She's A Rainbow\nstereo blaring. Consequently, I am\nrather worried by their decision to\nrelease it in February. Fortunately\nit was sunny last Sunday, so we did\nit anyway. Unfortunately. Knightsbridge was solid, and in no\nfit state for cruising along. Never\nmind.\nA fine uplifting Rolling Stones\ncover, baggy and bouncy, the single\nis the one for World Of Twist. And\nthe B side is one of the better tracks\nfrom Quality Street. Lose My Way.\nAll we can hope for is a mild\nwinter. Superb.\nLise Yates.\n\"One glaring omission is She's A Rainbow which is criminal.\" Felix\n915.\nTold you so. told you so. In an\neffort to get time off for good\nbehaviour. Circa have now decided\nto release She's A Rainbow as a single. This is an excellent\nsummery track for cruising down\nKnightsbridge with the roof down.\n- 1 2 \u2014\n\n"

Last term the\nnews was regularly broadcast on\nTuesdays and Thursdays, and\nThursday evening's 'Into the night'\nbrought you a diversity^ of. programmes from the quiz show\n'Going for Coppers' to coverage of\nthe Lord Mayor's Show, in which\nthe City & Guild College Union\nparticipated. Also last term, we saw\nthe introduction of 'Nostalgia\nNight'. a compilation of programmes from the large STOIC archive.\nThis term STOIC is working on\nmany new television shows\nincluding ' NEXT!', an\nimprovisation show in the same\nDo not Adjust your Sets\nAre you excited\nby the glory and\nglamour of a high octane\ncareer in\ntelevision\nbroadcasting ?\nThen join the\nBBC. But until\nnormal service\nresumes....\nvein as 'Whose line is it anyway\nand \"McRusky and Starch', at on u ge in cheek seventies police\ndrama. Also in the pipeline are a science-fiction drama, a serious\nquiz to find the 'Mastermind' of\nImperial College, a bi-weekly\nsatirical look at current news and a debating programme.\nNow at this point I can here all\nthose cynics out there making\ncomments about how STOIC never\nbroadcasts anything decent and no\none can watch it anyway. Well that\nis precisely why there are so many\nchanges taking place. On the\ntechnical side of things, possibilities\nto enable more and more people to\nwatch STOIC are continuously\nbeing explored. For example, the\nidea of putting television in\ndepartmental common rooms or\ninduction loops in halls so STOIC can be received in the individual\nrooms is being discussed. Also,\nideas are always being put forward\nto solve the technical nightmare that\nwould let STOIC reach Evelyn\nGardens (the technical manager was\nat one time seriously considering\ntaping coaxial cabling to the\npavement with gaffe r tape to do it).\nNow. the real problem is\nmanpower. There simply are not\nenough members of STOIC to allow\nall these ideas to be put into effect.\nThere are even three places on the\ncommittee waiting to be filled.\nPeople are needed in all fields. Take\nthe two weekly news programmes.\nAs a new era of cooperation\nbetween the internal media begins\nthere are vacancies for reporters,\neditors, script-writers and\npresenters. The dramas require\nproduction teams to help with set\nbuilding, directing, filming and post\nproduction. The quiz shows require\ncontestants and maintenance needed\nto keep the network and the studio\nrunning as well as the initiation of\nspecial projects like those\nmentioned above. And. of course,\nwe need people to staff the evening\ntransmissions. In fact there is room\nfor everyone at STOIC( not\nphysically of course, the premises\nare actually quite small).\nTherefore, what STOIC is now\nasking, is that anyone who is even\nremotely interested in any of the\nthings mentioned above (yes, even\nbeing an audience) comes up to\ntheir studio on the third floor of the\nUnion Building in Beit Quad to\nhave a look around and have a chat.\nIf you want to help, you will be\ngiven a comprehensive instruction\nin how to use all of the professional\nequipment that resides in the STOIC\nstudio including vision mixers,\neffects generators, editing\nmachines, sound desks, everything.\nAfter that you could specialise.\nMaybe join just one production\n\u2014 16\u2014\n\n"

Well if you\ndid you may have seen the\nphotograph of the 'Icicle Balloon\nMeet' in the sports section, which\npictured the Imperial College Hot\nAir balloon alongside the Cadbury's Creme Egg balloon.\nMembers of the IC Balloon club\nattended the 20th 'Icicle Balloon\nMeet' held at Marsh Benham near\nNewbury and enjoyed the\nunexpected flying. It was only on\nthe Friday evening that the weather\nreports were mentioning gales.\nTherefore it was with surprise that\nwe arrived at the field at sunrise,\nalong with about 80 other balloons\nand their crews, and realised that\nthe wind had completely dropped.\nAt the briefing the organisers\nsuggested that it was likely to get\nwindy again later in the morning\nand so everyone inflated their\nballoons and took off without much\ndelay.\nThose who weren't in the balloon\nfollowed it along the country lanes\ntowards the village of Hermilage\nwhere our balloon landed. The\nballoon had been flying generally in\na north-easterly direction, that of the predominant wind. After\nvisiting the farmer who owned the\ngrass field where the balloon\nlanded, packing away the balloon\nand refuelling the gas tanks, we\nthen headed off for breakfast.

Chair SED S Malaysian Sports Carniva\nOn Saturday 18th January members\nof the Imperial College Malaysia\nSociety travelled down to\nNottingham University as part of\nthe University of London contingent\nfor the Nottingham Sports Carnival.\nThis annual event was attended by\ntwelve participating Malaysian\nSocieties from all over the UK. The day began as early as 8am in\nthe morning as a coach load of Malaysians crept out of sleepy\nLondon. The two and a half hour\njourney was spent either catching up\non lost sleep or watching the action\nthriller ' Nico' on the video. It was\nabout 1 lam when the coach pulled\nup next to the Nottingham University Sports Centre.\nCoach loads of Malaysians had\nalready arrived from all everywhere\nand the place was crawling with\nMalaysians. The air was filled with\nstrange greetings in Barasa\nMalaysia (national language of\nMalaysia) coupled with the\naccommodating British accent\nwhich virtually everyone had\npitched onto by now. The scene in\nthe sports centre itself was like one\nout as 'Kotaraya' (a famous mall in\nMalaysia where young people hang\nout).\nSoon everyone was split up as the\nvarious games were being played\nsimultaneously. Scrabble and\nbadminton were among the first\nevents to be played. In both events\nthe London team made its way to\nthe semi-finals and quarter-finals\nrespectively before being narrowly\nbeaten. In the badminton the IC pair\nof EL Tan and Hakim put up a good\nfight before going down in the\nquarter-finals.\nMeanwhile squash and indoor\nfootball were already well underway. In squash all the\nLondoners made it through to the\nsecond round. Later in the\ntournament, Kannarudin ( LSE) clinched the title for London.\nFootball however proved to be a bit\nof a disappointment as the London\nteam crashed out in the early\nrounds.\nAs the games were going on there\nwas lots of time for catching up with\nold friends and acquaintances. A wide variety of Malaysian cuisine\nwas also on sale at reasonable prices\nfor those craving for a taste of home\nfood, indeed a pleasant change from\nones own cooking.\nAmong the last of the events was\nthe volleyball matches which can be\nsaid to be the highlight event of the\nday. The Londoners put up a tremendous effort and stayed in the\nevent right up to the semi-finals,\nbefore losing narrowly to the\nNottingham team in a close match.\nThough disappointed. the\nLondoners took the results (11-10)\nin good spirits.\nAfter exchanging addresses,\ntelephone numbers and such, we\nbade farewell to our hosts and\nfellow Malaysians before our long\nride back to London. It was almost\n2am Sunday morning as we queued\nfor the night buses in Trafalgar\nSquare before heading our\nrespective ways.\nOverall it can be said a successful\nouting and a good laugh was had by\nall. An enjoyable weekend with a couple of blisters and a few\npulled-muscles.\nSang. Civ Eng I6 "

He added\nthat the government had\nencountered legal problems in their\nefforts to reform the NUS. Mr Chope said that membership of the\nNUS should be an individual matter\nand added that students should be\nable to opt in or out of their college\nunions.\nThe minister's comments appear\nto be at variance with a recent ruling\nof the European court.

The letter said that\nsecurity should remain in-house if\nA recent survey has found that\nfewer students are dropping out\nfrom higher education courses\ndespite increased financial hardship.\nThe study, conducted by higher\neducation chiefs, also implies that\nself-financing students work harder.\nThe result is seen as a victory for\nthe supporters of the student loan\nscheme. Under the old grants\nsystem, 4% of students in higher\neducation left their courses early.\nThe recent freezing of grants and\ncollege student union, the European\ncourt ruled that students' unions\nformed an integral part of college\nlife. The minister commented that\nit was not for the European court\nto dictate to students' on whether\nthey should be members of college\nstudent unions.\nA spokesman for the Department\nof Education and Science told the\nCollege News Network ( CNN) that\nhe could not comment on any of the\nmatters raised by Mr. Chope. He\npointed out that the Birmingham\ncase was not a government matter\nand that Mr. Chope was speaking\nat Imperial College as a Conservative, and not as a government minister going outside\nhis area of resp on sib lili ty.

A MORI opinion poll\nfor the CVC P found that half of the\nparents questioned who earned in\nexcess of \u00a315.500,(figures quoted\nfrom the Guardian) which is just\nabove the national average, would\nbe prepared to pay towards tuition\nfees. The average they were willing\nto pay was \u00a31.000 a year. MORI polled 3.985 people.\nThe poll also revealed that 60\npercent of all the parents\ninterviewed did not support\ncontributing to fees, and those that\nwere willing to contribute \u00a31.000\nactually represented less than 10\npercent of the total.\nThe claim has been criticised for\nits biased presentation of the results.\nDiana Warwick.^general secretary\nFascist\nThere is growing evidence of fascist\nactivity amongst the British student\npopulation.

Puffing\nand panting, we wandered in and\nwere met and soon ushered into the\nchanging rooms.\nThe Sensitize Interview, part one\nPaul (the guitarist) and James (the\ndrummer) both come from\nCumbria, as do the other two\nmembers of the band that we had\nleft in the bar. After the rather\ntraditional hard start where both\nsides are a little edgy we soon got\ninto the flow.\n'What do you think of London\nthen'.'\" was. I thought, an original\nquestion.\n'We've lived in London for a year and a half, there's no going\nback\", they want to get away from\nthe wilds of the North West where\nthey feel there are no people,\nespecially not musically. The desire\nto break with the nine to five\nmentality seems almost a prerequisite for being in a band these\ndays.\nBeing friends at school, even pre-school, they seem to be looking for\n'a way out of what we had before,\nlike 'real jobs' and the small town\nexistence\". It's their prime motivation, although that's not to\nsay they have no ambition. They\nwant to go everywhere, they want\nto 'happen' and they believe they\nwill.\nThey have been supporting\nKingmaker on the 'Idiots at the\nWheel' tour, so I asked with a knowing smile, 'what plans have\nyou for the future'.\n'Well the second single comes out\nin March', and they are at the\nmoment doing a mini headline tour\nin some of the smaller clubs. It's just the start of the hard slog that\nthey need to do to get the fan base,\nit's the only way to get bring long\nterm success, they feel.\nAt this stage there was a small\ndiscussion about what sort of drum\nsticks the drummer uses on tour and\nthe fact that I 've always wanted to\nlearn to drum. Stories about\ncovering garages with egg boxes in\nvain attempts not to annoy the\nneighbours, all very interesting at\nthe time, but not why we were\nthere.\nThe Sensitize Interview, part two\nT know its a really crap question,\nbut where did the name come\nfrom?\"\n'Well it wasn't from us.' It seems\nthat when you sign to Food they\nalmost insist that you change your\nname. They've had millions of\nnames: 'Pop City Maniacs' for one.\ni You send a list of names, the record\ncompany send you a list of names\nand then you negotiate. 'There's a lot of shit names', 'but if we'd signed as Sensitize we would\nprobably of ended up being called\nPop City Maniacs'. The first few\nLondon gigs they did they used a different name for every night.\nThey didn't seem that fused about\nthe name: it 'just grows on you'.\nThen we got onto the real reason\nfor them doing the interview, the\ncurrent single. Its a nice bouncy\nmelody that does nobody no harm,\nbut what's it all about?\n'It's nothing to do with the\nsleeve', the Andy Warhol serial\nkillers. The real story is that at one\ngig when they were really crap the\nlead singer (Mark) was so pissed of\nwith the sound and the audience that\nhe just said 'fuck this' and dropped\n(or threw) his guitar which broke\nin two. The other three had to carry\non.\nAt the precise moment that I thought I was on a roll, there was\na knock on the door and in came the\nman from the T shirt company.\nAfter twenty seconds of chat he\nstarted talking to me and when he\nleft we had the impression he\nthought I was in the group. T wouldn't mind...is it a good life?'.\nWhich brought us onto the more\npersonal side of the group.\nThe Sensitize Interview, part\nthree\n'The sex. drugs and rock and roll',\n'when we're on tour we spot trees'\noffered James. 'Bullshit.\" We have\ndebauched lifestyle, we snort coke'\ncountered Paul. There then\nfollowed a discussion amongst the\ntwo group members about wether\nthey take drugs. Paul maintaining\nthat they had the typical myth\nlifestyle of a group and James\nsaying that they didn't have enough\nmoney to take drugs and all they\ncould do was read books on trees.\n'We shag everything', was the\ncomment that seemed to shut up\nJames, 'sorry, I take that back'.\nThere then passed a few seconds\nbefore the re conciliatory comment\n'we shag trees' passed from Paul's lips. They said they were tree lovers\nand that the favourite tree, the 'tree\nof the month' was the Scotch Pine.\nIt then degenerated into a general\nchit-chat and then into us being\nushered out into the masses that had\nstarted spewing into the halls. What\ndid 1 think of them? They should do\nwell if. and it is a big if, they can\nmake their material dist igu ish able from the other 'indie guitar bands'\naround at the moment.

And David gave us the\nWord, and the Word was Shite\nbecause it has an arrogant Scouse\nWanker on it.\nAnd so it came to pass that\ntimorously we entered the Office of\nFelix. No-one knew who we were,\nor what we did. and they say ed: 'Who are you, that doth open all the\nmail and use sundry paste-up\nimplements?' And were it not for\nour resignation, we would be there\nstill.\n(*whip out top hats and canes*)\nWe used to review lots of films\nAnd paste up all the jottings.\nNow we're dead.\nSo enough said.\nWe'll just lie here rotting.\nWe used to go watch all the hits\nAnd try to give an unbalanced\nview\nOf all the good and bad bits\nTrving to rhyme is very hard to\ndo'\nDoo be do be do be do (-NB.\nfrom Sinatra)\n(*Soft shoe shuffle*)\nWe used to do be do be do be\ndo\nDo be do be do be do\nBut now we do be do be do be\ndo do do be do\nPutrefaction (do be do) supreme.\nSo. on entry to the Felix office\nwe met Adam of Tinworth. and\nverily he said : \"In On A Monday,\nOut On A Wednesday\"\nDo be do be do.

Who dunn it, where, with what and...Why?\nBeccy. his mourning wife is\noffering thousands of prizes to\nteams that will help her in the quest\nto find the murderer, so get your\narse into gear and play Cluedo\ntomorrow (or be square and watch\na spot of TV). If you haven't been hungover for\nthe whole week, you should have\nnoticed the odd dead body outline\naround Imperial College. If your IQ\nis positive (in IC?), you mug ht have\nassociated them with this term's Greatest. Meanest. Coolest. Grooviest. Excessive. Wild. Freaky. Most Drunken rag event\nyet.\nSo what's all this hype? and,\ncome to think of it, what's Cluedo\nanyway? Remember Monopoly?\nWell Cluedo uses the same concept,\ntake a small fry board game and\nmake it big. very big. London Big! Cluedo is based on the well known\nboard game...Cluedo. Those of you\nwho have never played Cluedo can\ngo home, or rather come and\nredeem yourself this Saturday. The\nmain aim of our Cluedo is for you\nto have fun, however, as a side-line.\nUs A Cluedo\na bit of do sh for Rag would be\nwelcome. The money you collect\ngoes to Winged Fellowship, a charity that gives disabled people a chance to participate in activities\n. that we take for granted such as an\nafternoon of horse-riding or beach\ntrips. Furthermore, those nice\npeople at the charity with the nice\nlogo (see above) are offering a computer to the Rag that raise the\nmost dough (no pun intended). Thus\nthere will be millions of other Rags\naround that will come to the simply\nkick in' party for all collectors later\nthat evening in the union. This also\nmeans that al tough we will be by far\nthe largest Rag around, we need\nyou to do some mean collecting! On\nthe subject of prizes, here is just a taste of what's on offer for YOU! A dinner for two goes to the best\ncollector.\nA free first pint\u2014probably\u2014to\nevery member of the winning team\n(point wise) on the Oxfam Firkins\nPub Leap (on 29th Feb).\nA Rag mag to everybody\ncollecting over a pound!\nAnd (if Scrooge pulls his finger\nout!!) many more press ies. Tiddlywinks was big but it hurt\nyour fingers. Monopoly was bigger\nbut not gory enough. The Great\nSightseeing Challenge was large but\nwhere were the mascots? Answer:\nthey were warming up for the\nbiggest event of them all, CLUE DO! Be there, meet death, meet Theta,\nDavey and S&B. meet the Cluedo\ncharacters in the flesh (and get their\nautograph), see Tamsin's sexy legs\n(Again!!) and avenge the death of\nthe flat-footed-flightless-fiend\n(Penguin).\nConvinced yet?\nOK, here is what you do:\nTurn up in Beit Quad as soon as\npossible after 10am on Saturday\nwith a team of about four or six\npeople.\nAt this point you will be given a collecting tin and a clue sheet.\nThe object of the game is to visit\nthe nine locations around London\nthat are relevant to the rooms on the\nCluedo board. The catch here is the\nfact that you have to work out. from\nthe clues, where these locations\nactually are. For example the\nlibrary might be the British Library\n(it's not!).\nThe rooms are:\nBilliards Room\nDining Room\nConservatory\nBallroom\nKitchen\nLibrary\nLounge\n. Study\nHall\n\n"

M sO 'Callaghan said that\nit is highly unlikely that any storage\nfacilities will be available for\nstudents in areas used for business\npurposes'. These include Weeks.\nLinstead and Southside Halls of Residence which are used as\nconference accommodation during\nthe holidays.\nIn previous years, one room has\nbeen set aside per approximately 25\nstudents to store personal\nbelongings over Easter and this year\nJean Harries. Southside Halls\nHousekeeper, said 'the utmost will\nbe done to provide facilities but\nthere can be no guarantee of\nstorage'.\nGraham Daniels. Residences\nArea Manager, said provision for\nstorage will be the same as in the\nlast few years, but said he could not\ncomment about any increase in\naccommodation prices as it was not\nwhat he dealt with.\nRadio Petition\nImperial College Radio launched a petition on 22nd January to try to\ngel support for an FM licence. The\nlicence would allow the station to\nbroadcast up to three miles from its\nstudios which would include Evelyn\nGardens as well as all Southside\nresidences.\nMr David Lane. IC Radio Station\nManager, said an FM licence would\ngive better sound quality and that\nresponse from listeners to a test\nlicence three years ago was\namazing'. The Department of\nTrade and Industry, who award\nRadio licences, did not award a full\nlicence for unknown reasons. Mr Lane continued that IC Radio had\nmore equipment than 'many\nprofessional stations' and could\nbroadcast on FM as soon as a licence was granted. He claimed\nthis would give the Union better\nvalue for the \u00a325,000 that has been\ninvested in the Radio Station over\nthe past ten years.\nMr Lane was not optimistic about\nreceiving a licence, as many\npoliticians are caught up with the\nforthcoming general elections, but\nthe prospects were good for the\nstation to get a licence within the\nnext three years.\nWC Closed\nWestfield College, the Hampstead.\nsite of Queen Mary and Westfield\nCollege ( QM WC) in London, is to\nfinally close at the end of this\nacademic year. Jo Fisher. QM WC Mile End Road site Vice President,\ntold Felix that the College was\nbuilding more ac como dati on to\nhouse the expected 450 to 500 new\nstudents. She added that all of them\nshould be able to continue their\ndegrees without hinder ance. but that\nstudents from Westfield College\nwere 'very bothered' about the\nmove. This comes at the end over\nover two years of negotiations.\n(Cub. QMWC).\nPenguin dies for charity? Rag Chairman plays dead in Cluedo, a Rag\nevent taking place on Saturday. See page 4.\nEGM Plug\nThe Extraordinary General Meeting\n( EG M) on Thursday 6 February\ncould see women banned from the\nUnion Bar. The motion has been\nproposed by Emma Holmes (Chem\nI) who suggested that as only 23%\nof Imperial students are female, the\nmasculine majority should be\nallowed their own watering hole in\nwhich rugby players and the like\nwill be able to wallow. Miss\nHolmes believes this will be a great\nattraction to prospective students.\nUnion President Zoe Hellinger\nwill propose that Departmental\nRepresentatives should regain the\nright to vote on the Union Council.\nThis right was removed in 1991\nwhen the new Union Bye-Laws\nwere passed by the Governing Body\nof the College, whereupon they\nbecame permanent observers. Other\nmotions will include the affiliation\nto the Anti-Nazi League and a proposal concerning student\nhardship.\nThis meeting will also see the\nvoting-in of a new Rag Chairman.\nThe candidates are Marc Ellis\n(Physics II). who is currently acting\nchairman, and Aled Fenner (Civ\nEng II), who is currently the\nNational Association of Rag representative. You must bring\nyour union card to vote.\nThe EG M will be held at 1.00pm on Thursday 6 February in the\nJunior Common Room (JCR).\n\n"

Film Society present\nNikita. the top French film of 1990.\nstarring the gorgeous Anne Parillaud.\nFollowing a shoot out during a raid on a Parisian drugstore, Nikita\n(the title heroine) is given a life\nsentence for the murder of a gendarme, instead she finds herself\ngiven the choice of either death or\nbecoming a government assassin,\nthe world outside has been told that\nshe is dead. She has little choice and\nso starts training for her new career.\nTransferred to a gigantic hi-tech\nwarehouse she is trained in the skills\nof the trade - including the finer\npoints of femininity. At first she is\nrebellious, but gradually she\nknuckles down and becomes an\nGrease\nThe long awaited opening of Grease\nwas. I am sorry to say. a disappointment. Two hours of\nnonexistent story later I find myself\nwondering where \u00a38000 of Union\nmoney has gone.\nWhen the production finally\nstarted, fifteen minutes late, we\nwere subjected to random bursts of\nfeedback during the opening\nnumbers as microphones were\nhanded around the stage willy-n illy. As the evening progressed we were\nshocked by the complete lack of\ndirection on stage. Too many\nparticipants hindered the smooth\nflow in large dance routines, long\nscene changes broke up what little\nplot there was.\nThe set was probably the best part\nof the production. The neon signs,\neffective 'burger bar' and multi-levelled stage, supporting a live\nband, did add considerable aesthetic\nappeal, but the lighting never\nreached its full potential bearing in\nmind the size of the lighting rig.\nSandy (Rowan Fenner) battled\nexcellent student, and an apparent\nfavourite of her tutor Bob. After the\nlengthy training she is launched into\nher new career of disposing of\ntargets according to instructions.\nHer release to the outside world\nbrings a new identity, boyfriend,\nfiat and comfortable lifestyle. The\nhappiness brings complications\nincluding hiding from her boyfriend\nthe true nature of her work. Each\nmurder that she executes causes\nincreasing anguish and remorse,\nand we witness her slow\ndeterioration as the double life that\nshe has to lead takes its toll. Filmed\nin the familiar azure glow that is the\nhallmark of Besson movies, Nikita\nis a stylish film that maintains the\nsuspense throughout with a dead\nsexy star, miss it at your peril.\nThe film will be screened in\nMech Eng 220. at 7-30 pm,\nThursday 6th February. Entry is\n80p for members, and 1-80 for non\nmembers, so come along for a great\nevenings entertainment.\nwith poor sound management\nthroughout the first act but picked\nup noticeably after the interval\nwhen control of the sound board\nchanged hands. The contribution\nmade by the rest of the 'pink ladies'\nwas also good. The male chorus\nwas less polished and was vastly\noverpowered by the women's voices most of the time. Sadly,\nDanny (Ben Guest), did not meet up\nto the requirements of such a demanding lead and was outshone\nby other members of the 'Burger\nPalace Boys', notably Roger (Ed\nMulligan).\nThe production needed another\nfull dress rehearsal to remove the\nfinal glitches in the performance.\nHowever, the band conducted itself\nmost professionally. By the time\nyou read this review. Grease will\nhave had three performances. The\ncast and crew will hopefully have\nrelaxed into their roles and provide\nstunning final performances on the\nFriday and Saturday nights.\nThe opening night suffered from\ntechnical problems which should be\nresolved as the show continues\nalthough it would have been more\nprofessional if this had been\nachieved beforehand.\nThe Good, the Bad, the Ugly\nand the Short.\njj\nSomebody's been busy with paste\nand bS ush. the posters are\neverywhere around West London.\nAll My Sons is set in late 40s America and it's based around the\nKeller family. Jo Keller (Ian\nBannen) is the father of the sons.\nOne of which, Chris, works with\nhim at his factory. The other son,\nLarry, never came back from the\nwar. The father and son admit that\nLarry must be dead but the mother\nis going to keep on waiting. When\nAnn. Larry's childhood sweetheart,\ncomes to stay, for she is now\nChris's girl, the initial portrait of a happy, secure and loving family is\ngradually dismantled. Jo Keller is\na charismatic, jovial and popular\nman. He is successful in business\nand his family is his drive. But we\ndiscover what this is based upon and\nthis raises many questions on\nloyalty. patriotism and\nresponsibility.\nThere are many issues that run\nthrough this play and many clever,\nwitty and poignant lines. As we got\ncloser to the truth of each character\nin the play the implications of the\nissues widen. You really do see. if\nyou didn't already know, how easy\nit is for a family to be held together\nby lies and fear of the truth.\nMatthew Marsh as Chris and\nSusan Sylvester as Ann were both\nexcellent and carried it for some of\nthe weaker performances. Namely,\nIan Bannen who was sloppy and\nunconvincing. Unfortunately half\nthe cast had plausible, unobtrusive\nAmerican accents and the rest were\neither over the top. half-hearted or\nthey slipped in and out of different\naccents. On the whole though, it's a sensitive and powerful\nproduction.\nThe Young Vic is a friendly and\ninformal theatre and was founded\nin 1970 to make theatre more\naccessible to young people and\nstudents. It is also theatre in the\nround which can make you feel\nmore involved in the play. All My\nSons runs until February 29th. Tickets are \u00a37.50 with student card\nand \u00a313 without. For performance\ntimes call the Box Office on\n071-633 0133.\nDarwen.\n\u2014 14\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "31 January 1992 Felix 924 Editorial\neditorial\nFree speech is an unpredictable\nanimal. It is dangerous, often brutal\nand often messy. It also has a tendency to bite the user. There is\nthe belief in this country that free\nspeech is acceptable, but always\nwith the unwritten caveat unless it\nattacks me. This is why certain\nCollege people get so irate when\nsomething appears in Felix of which\nthey do not approve - if you, the\nreader, want Felix to comment on\nthe running of the College, the\nUnion or the Government, you. the\nreader, have to put up with\ncomments you do not approve of.\nFor instance. and totally\nhypothetically, if one of the Union\nclubs or societies acquires a piece\nof extremely expensive equipment,\nthus reducing the budget for other\nclubs or societies, is the first loyalty\nof this newspaper to the club with\nthe expensive equipment?\nPublicising the fact may attract the\nattention of thieves, it may damage\nthe Union, and some would say by\nso doing student's interests are\ndamaged. Equally, is loyalty due to\nother clubs who now cannot buy\nwhat they wanted? Or is it to the\ngeneral student populace?\nIn truth, there is no loyalty factor.\nIf it is news, it should be publicised,\nirrespective of the effect, as it\ncannot be ascertained beforehand\nwhat the effect is. This is, of course, an ideal, as Felix in no way\npublicise s everything, though\naiming for some ideal is better than\ndrifting. What appears in Felix is\nan expression of free speech - take\nit or leave it, agree or disagree,\nrespond or remain in a miffed\nsilence, but I will not entertain the\nnotion that anything in Felix should\nnot have gone in. If mistakes are\nmade, then you should help correct\nthem - or even better, help us avoid\nthem by telling us what you know.\nNews Integration.\nTo aid the integration of news\nstories coverage within College, IC\nRadio, STOIC( television) and\nFelix have agreed to interchange\nnews on a regular basis. The\nstructure of this integration has been\narranged mainly by Jonty Beavan,\nthe Felix news editor, Declan\nCurry. IC Radio's answer to Jorn\nCorl at Wastminsterrr and Dave\nHenderson-B, STOIC business\nmanager. They have also given it\na provisional name - the College\nNews Network, or CNN. They will\nnot go down in history as the\nworld's greatest pun ner s, but this\nco-operation is long overdue, I sincerely hope it continues.\nIn a similar manner, the first\nedition of the Directory of British\nStudent Newspapers is now on sale\nat \u00a36.50 a copy. This is the result\nof a survey conducted over about\n180 student unions in the country,\nto which about sixty responded,\nasking for information into their\nstudent newspapers. It is to be\nhoped that this will aid integration\nof current affairs relevant to\nstudents across a wider area.\nApologies are due in respect of\nthe delay in the travel special. This\nis because a few articles came in\nlate, and I could not arrange 24\npages to be printed in time. I particularly apologise to the\nsocieties from the far east to whom\nI promised a double page spread\nthis week - it will go in next week,\nand I think it will look good.\nGrease.\nI thoroughly recommend the\nreadership to go and see 'Grease'\nin the Great Hall tonight and over\nthe weekend. You will not be able\nto tell how good or .bad it is un les you have seen it and though there\nwere problems on the opening\nnight, there is the possibility that\nthese will be ironed out by now.\nThe tickets are only \u00a3 4 with an IC student card. I hope the crew and\ncast are enjoying the experience.\nCredits.\nJonty. Scott. Stef. Andy. Marge\nInnal. Simon. Toby. Steve F. Rose.\nPoddy, Jeremy, Chris P. Stuart R. Dave HB. James. Khurrum. Ian.\nSam. The Amazing Flying Sumit\nand Matts. Catherine. Steve N. Rubina. Richard Foreman. Troy\nTempest and last but least, the\nMangy Knapsack Pale and Various\nFergies. And I extend my apologies\nto all those I have forgotten.\nWhat is this 1 hear around College\nthat I am none other than the red\nheaded lady of the night. Ms Sam\nCox. I would just like to say that\nthese rumours are totally unfounded\nand that although she is one of my\nmain informants she and I are not\none. As to the revealing of my true\nidentity. I am Marge, there is no\none else involved.\nOn to the subject of gossip around\nCollege, well let me think. Ah yes.\nthe party at Trig and Cos flat.\nWell, well Poddy. I didn't think you\nhad it in you me old muck er, and\nwith a damn yank to boot. Slightly\nhypocritical don't you think, mind\nyou beggars can't be choosers can\nthey. Oh and as an after thought.\nTrigger the reason they don't go for\nyou but chose people like Poddy is\nclear. It's the mystery, you make it\nclear that you want a shag, he\nmakes it clear that he wants to talk\nabout it for an hour or two first.\n(Slightly in-joke there, apologies.)\nAs to everything else. I think\nthere are a few people around\nCollege who are rather upset that\nSteve 'Hon Sec' Farrant got off scot\nfree from his mindless attempt at\nasserting his authority the other\nFriday, and I don't mean certain\nFelix staff or casual employees of\nthe Union. Lets face it. if a student\nhad performed such a mindless act\nduring a bar extension and\ninebriated to the same level that I understand Mr. Farrant was. they\nDearjJVIarge\nwould have been banned from the\nUnion building for at least a term\nif not having to face a disciplinary\nat the same time. It brings into light\nthe old saying 'look after your own'\n(Joesn't it? And talking of looking\nafter your own. Why should the\nonly person who has kept the bar\nrunning over the last few months\nbeen the one who has had to resign?\nSurely it is time for the Union to\ntake a good look at itself and decide\nonce and for all what they are there\nfor. To care for the students or to\ncare for themselves.\nI have just heard from a reliable\nsource that a certain Guilds person\nhas taken to watching hard core\nporn videos. Miss Kate.B. the\nroving eye has caught you out!\nAnd a cryptic message to Miss\nA. M.ow has nt bout annie o th been n obvious he this lo or fortnight? Auntie Marge\ninflicts the\nslings and\narrows of\noutrageous\nfortune.\n~3 \u2014\n\n"

Starting at the top\nthis week, we have 2 Lost Sons,\nfresh and frantic after a Lise Yates\ninterview, and she says \" I'd advise\nyou to go and see them.\" What\nfurther recommendation could you\ndesire?

After they finished their set.\nI asked the blok e next to me who\nthey were, and he said \" Trash.\" After spotting my bamboozled look,\nhe explained that Trash is their\nname, and they released a single on\nCaptain Sensible's record label\nabout 18 months ago. and they're\nabout to release another.

However\nthey started shakily with goalie\nEmma bulldozing the opposition's forwards to concede a penalty, and\nsoon found themselves in the\nunusual position of being 1-0 down.\nUndeterred, the team regrouped and\nequalise d seconds later to show\nRH B NC that they meant business.\nFrom then on the Dribblers were on\ntheir way.\nAfter being 6-1 up. star\nmidfielder Rachel was stretcher ed off the pitch, her face dripping with\nblood. With only 10 players\nremaining RH B NC were allowed a consolation goal, to finish losers\n6-2. But true to their form, the\nDribblers thrashed them in the boat\nrace! This result comfortably put\nthem through to the semi-finals to\nface Kings College.\nThe next day at 11am only 6\nplayers had turned up with the semifinal beckoning. By noon the\nDribblers had managed to scrape\ntogether 9 (2 of whom were\nabsolute beginners) and had\narranged to meet 2 more at\nWimbledon station. True to form,\ngoalie Emma kept us all in suspense\nand arrived just as the train was\nabout to depart. At last they had a full team, and the captain could\nbreathe a premature sigh of relief.\nHowever on arrival, the team\nfound to their horror a ground more\nsuitable to mud wrestling than for\nfootball. Ignoring the inadequacies\nof the pitch, the Dribblers began\nwell, especially in defence against\na vicious attack but seemed to be\nlacking something up front (Permi\nmaybe ?). With an excellent goal\nline clearance from Rachel and\nEmma tipping one shot over the bar\nin spectacular fashion, the Dribblers\nprevented the opposition from\nscoring. Therefore at half time, they\nwere unlucky to be 1-0 down.\nAfter a team talk, which everybody chose to ignore, disaster\nstruck in the second half. With\nenthusiasm lacking plus a series of\ninjuries and fatigue problems from\nthe previous days quarter-final\ngame, the Dribblers faded grimly\nand ended up losing 6-0.\nSorry Permi. we tried our best!\nPreviously, the Dribblers has\nplayed East Anglia in the U AU Cup.

After\nconceding 2 unlucky goals in the\nli rst half, the Dribblers fought back\nvaliantly.\nThe defence were amazing,\nespecially Linda who even saved a near home goal from Arlene. It was\na moral victory, even though they\nlost 2-0!\nThe weather was freezing - with\nshowers to match. To drown their\nsorrows all had bev vies on the way\nback which nearly resulted in the\ndriver being overcome by the\nfumes. Thanks to Sharon who drove\nwith speed and efficiency - what a star. And the Dribblers would like\nto say hello to Sharon's mum!\nDespite all these losses, the\nDribblers are still top of the league,\nso all is not lost (yet?).\nJumping\nNow that Christmas is over and\ngrant cheques and student loans\nhave put a new lease of life into\nyour massive overdraft, this is the\ntime to do your most challenging\nfeat yet - a parachute jump!
