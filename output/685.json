During the first\nhalf, despite consistent pressure\non the opposition's goal, IC\ncould not convert their\nopportunites and half-time came\nwith the score-line still at 0-0. The\ncaptain, having forgotten the\noranges, did not have a chance\nto give a team-talk and this\nseemed to do the trick. The\ncollege attack looked much\nmore threatening after the\ninterval and, after 15 mins of\nfurther play, Jonathan Sturgess\nlopped the ball over the keeper's head and into the net. A second\ngoal come shortly afterwards\nwhen Dave Whitton, who had\nplayed superbly all match, put-Sturgess clear for his second\ngoal. IC were then content to\nslow the pace of the match down\nand ensured victory with steady\nplay.\nSpecial thanks goes to Jon\nHarvey and Julian Westcott, two\nvery raw recruits, who turned up\nat very short notice, enabling IC\nto field a full side.\nU AU vs SURREY\nIC SURREY\nBadminton Men 1st4 \u2014 5\n2nd18 Ladies ' 2\nFootball 1st0 \u2014 3\n2nd423 rd24 Golf 2 - 4\nHockey Men 0 \u2014 2\nLadies 0 3\nNetball 1st6 \u2014 50\n2nd1936 Rugby 1st12 \u2014 0\n2nd166 Squash 4 1\nFOOTBALL\nHat trick\nfor Dent\nIC 2nd XI vs Surrey (UAU) won\n4\u20142\nAfter losing the first U AU game\nIC 2nd went all out to beat\nSurrey. In a tough match Paul\nDent put us 1\u20140 up after a good\nflick on by Pat Stamford. Surrey\nequaled by a goal left foot shot\nand then took the lead early in\nthe second half. Paul got a brilliant 2nd goal as IC superior\nfitness started to show. Pauls\nhat-trick was completed after a good strong challenge (foul) by\nPat split the defence. A late goal\nby Martin from a good ball from\nKev left us 4\u20142 up. A great team\nperformance especially by the\ndefence.\nRUGBY\nIC Rugby 3rd XV vs St Thomas\n14-4\nThis week IC completed the\nwhitewash with a stylish win over\nthe Medics third. A full\ncomplement of fifteen men\ntravelled to Surrey with the first\nXV and on a good afternoon\nproduced some rugby worthy of\ntheir more illustrious colleagues.\nEarly pressure by St Thomas,\nbefore IC settled in, resulted in\nan un converted try. But that was\nthe last time the opposition\nthreatened, even with a strong\nwind at their backs.\nExcellent handling by IC backs\nin blustery conditions should\nhave produced a hat ful of tries\nhowever, tries by R Chirchin, M Tester and S Turner (converting\nhis) were well deserved. A scratch pack performed well\nunder pressure and a good game\nwas had by all.\nIC Rugby at Harlington last Wednesday\nBADMINTON\nShoe\nShortage\nMens II vs Kings College II\nIC expected this to be a tough\nfixture as the 'team' consisted of\ndrafted members of the third\nteam and others \u2014 the regulars\nwere seeking glory in the U AU. Things started badly \u2014 only\nfive pairs of shoes between six\nplayers, and the captain,\nrevelling in his new position of\npower, tactically lost 2 games in\norder to test his new players\nunder pressure. With the score\nstanding at Kings 4, Imperial 1,\nthe opposition captain left,\nworrying about the problems of\nbeing' winning' captain( processing the score sheet etc).\nAs a friendly gesture, to save him\nany trouble, IC won the\nremaining 4 games to clinch the\nfixture 5\u20144. With thanks to:\nDave Westland (capt), Henry\nLim, William Cheung, Raymond,\nStephen Thomas, Toong Por\nCheah.\nSAILING\nIC Ist\u20142 University of Essex\u20140\nIC 2nd \u20142 Essex\u20140\nThis weekend, IC Sailing team\ntook the University of Essex and\ntheir fleet of 420's by storm.\nFor the first race the teams\nhad to be towed to the race\nground. The tide being stronger\nthan the wind, the boats had little\nchoice over the course. After\nsome excellent tacking and some\ndubious moves from Essex we\nrounded the first mark. Howarth\nand Bennet-Clark took the lead\nand -due to excellent tactics\nrapidly rounded the second\nmark and drifted through the\nfinish line in 1st place.\nThe rest of the team followed\nin 2nd and 3rd place. Baynes and\nBevan having sailed past Robson and Hill despite their problems in\nrounding the 1st mark.\nEssex were disheartened and\nsailed our 2nd team.

    "content": "\u2022 T IT ERS: OUR\nBloding writes\nDear Sir,\nFame at last! I'm glad to see that finally\nFELIX has acknowledged that STOIC is run\nby a group of dedicated and hardworking\nindividuals. However, in your item last week,\nyou got a number of facts wrong:\nFirst of all, people don't join STOIC just to\naid their job prospects; indeed the vast\nmajority join because they enjoy making TV programmes and using equipment which\nwould normally cost \u00a3800 per day to hire!\nSecondly, you have the gall to imply that\nthere is a lack of professionalism within\nSTOIC! We have a tape, sent to us by another\nstudent TV group, which you are welcome to\ncome and see, which shows that STOIC is the\nbest student TV in the country!\nFinally, have you forgotten that during the\nsummer FELIX requested, and STOIC\ninstalled, a line so that you can watch\nprogrammes in the FELIX offices? I trust\nthat you will be among our many viewers for\nNEWS BREAK on Thursdays, if only to\npla gu rise it for the following days FELIX. Yours (in the spirit of media co-operation),\nMartin Bolding\nSTOIC Chairman\nWet blanket\nDear Sir,\nAs the Diving Officer of the Underwater\nClub I feel I must cast my spurs aside and\nreply to Mr Snivel's letter (Felix 26/10).\nThe club exists to enable students at IC to\nlearn to dive. So far this year we have 50 new\ntrainee's and 6 experienced divers to train\nthem. All these instructors, 2nd and 3rd year\nundergraduates, give 5 or 6 hours of their\nspare time each week to carry out the\ntraining. The club diving trips are organised\nto complement the training programme\nwhich involves a large amount of swimming\npool training.\nAll dives require, for safety's sake, a novice\nto dive with an experienced diver.\nUnfortunately very few experienced divers\ndeign to turn up; out of 20 divers trained last\nyear only 4 turn up regularly, thus there is an\nupper limit of 12 members per trip. In\naddition, most trips are to Cornwall and high\nmileages of 1000-1500 miles are common.\nThus they are very expensive, even with\nunion subsidies. Consequently it is hard to\nraise interest and they are less frequent than\nwe would like.\nOn the social side, all members are\nencouraged to meet above Southside bar\nafter every training session, lively discussion\non all aspects of diving takes place and\nconstructive criticism is welcomed.\nFinally I would ask Mr Snivel to come and\ntalk to us, we're very friendly people and will\nhappily discuss his misconceptions about the\nclub.\nYours sincerely\nNick Cozens\nUnderwater Club Diving Officer\nDear Sir\nI am forced to reply to the article in last\nweek's Felix concerning the sub-aqua club. It\nwould appear we have rather upset this\ngent l men in some way, although I am amazed\nat some of the accusations he has made.\nI 'll start at the beginning with his rather\nvague comments concerning our introductory meeting. This consisted of the\nfirst two lectures of the B SAC snorkel\ntraining program (on Branch Organisation,\nand choice of Basic Equipment) which were\nseperated by a slide show. Now the\ngentleman concerned may have known all\nabout this, having some experience in\nSCUBA diving, but the vast majority of\npeople present did not, and have to start at\nthe beginning.\nThe accusation that the club's executive\nare a bunch of drunken cowboys I find even\nharder to take. The club's executive takes out\ntwo evening a week Tuesdays and Thursdays\nto train novice divers to B SAC specification.\nThis includes the preparing and giving of\nlectures and pool training. Unlike non-college branches of the B SAC this instruction\nis given free of charge. I would be surprised to\nfind many college clubs doing more than this.\nThe idea that anybody giving lectures is\ndrunk is equally ridiculous. If the gentleman\nfeels that the can of Forster I drink with my\npie before giving the lecture classifies me as\ndrunk, then I'm afraid our definitions of\ndrunk differ sharply.\nThe other main accusations concern the\nbar, and its use for organising club outings.\nAfter having finished with the pool training\nmost of us like to go over to the bar to relax,\nand this is generally where we talk about and\nplan club activities, again this is not\nsomething I feel is desperately unsual.\nEverybody is welcome and indeed\nencouraged, to come down to voice opinions\nand ideas. What the gentleman calls a clique\nare people who have know each other for\nseveral years^ some of whom have left college,\nbut still come back to help out with\ninstruction. Moreover, people who are not\nfull members of IC Union do not receive a union subsidy.\nThe last accusation is that three trips a term is not enough at thirty to forty pounds a weekend, I find that with my grant I can't afford much more. Apart from this most\npeople in the past have been reluctant to give\nup more time through academic or other\nsocial reasons.\nI don't know why we have upset the\ngentlemen concerned so much, but the\naccusations he made against us are quite\nsimply bullshit.\nYours sincerely\nEric Tietema\nUnderwater Club Chairman\nFELIX\nThe Rector was quite right, in his\nCommemoration Day speech, to come out in\nfavour of a broader education for 16 to 18\nyear olds.\nOne only has to look at the standard of\nwritten English achieved by most Imperial\nCollege students to see the advantages that\ncould be gained by scientists learning; English\nbeyond 'O' Level. But despite the 'evils of\nover-specialization', it seems to be true that\nthe universities are demanding higher\nentrance requirements that can only be met\nby doing specialized subjects at A level.\nIf students are to sit seven or eight A levels\ninstead of three or four, how can they be\nexpected to meet the exacting standards of\nthe universities?\nThe idea of the AS-level is a compromise; it\nis intended to broaden and supplement the\nnormal A level curriculum. But it must, per\nforce, lead to some lowering in the standard\nachieved in the student's specialist A levels\nIn may countries the solution to this\nproblem is to have four year degree courses,\nbut with a Government committed to cutting\nthe education budget, this seems unlikely to\nhappen here.\nClearly the schools and universities are\ngoing to have to think long and hard about\nthe consequences of a broader more balanced\ncurriculum. Someone, somewhere, will have\nto pay for it.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to\nGrenville, Dave, Jon, Martin, Andrew,\nRichard, Graham, Ajay, Tinker, Nick Gillie,\nBB Wolffe, Andy, Rosemary, Tony and all\nthe colla tors.

    "content": "SPORTS\nHOCKEY\nGoalie lost\nSNOOKER\nFirst victory\nsoon?\nSnooker\nManor park\u20147 IC\u20145\nWhen a team is still awaiting its\nfirst win of the season, a visit to\nManor Park seems quite a daunting prospect. However,\nplaying against one of the top\nteams in the league IC produced\ntheir best performance of the\nseason so far, just losing by the\nodd frame in this best of 12 frame\nmatch.\nIan Grindall, Jared Quereslin\nand team captain, Michael\nPowell each captured a frame\nwhile, John West did particularly\nwell to win both of his frames in\nthis difficult away match.\nHopefully on the strength of\nthis performance that elusive\nfirst victory of the season is just\naround the corner.\nWATER POLO\nDraw with\nIsleworth\nWater Polo\nIC vs Isleworth 5\u20145\nIC vs Lloyds 5\u20146\nThe IC water polo team opened\nthis year with two good matches.\nThe score lines reflected close\ncontests with some great play\nafter a long summer lay off.\nAgainst Isleworth, Imperial\nopened the scoring. Four\nquarters later two results were\nrumoured, a6 \u20145 win and a5 \u20145\ndraw. The latter score was\nofficial.\nThe match with Lloyds was a fixture for the Freshers team. At\nhalf time Imperial were 3\u20141\nahead. Lloyds however have a reputation for making the most\nout of a marine crisis and pulled\nback to a5 \u20146 win.\nThis year there are plans to\nput together an IC second team\nfor the middlesex league. Any\nFresher or would be polo player\ncoming to the training session\nwill be welcome to play, (water\npolo and swimming 6.30\nMondays IC Sports Centre).\nX COUNTRY\nImperial\ndefend cup\nX Counfry\nOn Wednesday Imperial began\ntheir defence of the London\nGOLF\nSudbury\nIC vs Surrey Univ 24.10.84\nLast week's match was held at\nSudbury Golf Club, which has\naccepted affiliation from Golfsoc\nand will be the venue for\nforthcoming society events.\nAlthough a course of great\npromise, not having too many\nbushes to lose balls in it was\nsomewhat marred on Wednesday by near monsoon conditions, which threatened to\nturn the game into a test of who\ncould swim best with a set of\nclubs round his neck. Nevertheless, six foolhardy\nfellows followed by a friendly\nfour ball fr on. IC set out to do\nbattle. Despite a scorching 70\nfrom one Mark Cox, the team\nwere sadly beaten 4\u20142, and will\ntherefore not qualify for the\nRyder Cup this year. The fate of\nthe four ball is unknown.\nHOCKEY\nLosing trend\nto reverse?\nAmid torrential rain and\ndarkened skies on Wednesday\nthe 1st XI hockey put up a fine\ndisplay against Surrey University, and lost, led by\ncaptain Andy Stewart, who\ndemonstrated, an inability to\nscore at at penalty flick, the team\nkept its season aggregate of\ngoals at one. The game was once\nagain marred by the lack of\numpires; a position which was\ncom pet ant ly filled by Morris in\nthe first half and Paule Lufkin in\nthe second. The latter, despite\nhis respiratory difficulties, did\nespecially well in disallowing two\nSurrey goals. The Surrey umpire\nwas best summed up by Ian\nParker whose advice about the\npurpose of a whistle was happily\ncut short in time for him to avoid\nan early shower. Surrey did\nscore two goals which were not\ndisallowed.\nTeamJ West, A Stewart, P Smith, K McCormick, I Parker,\n' M Hedges, P Oliver, N Collie, P Dubenski, N Hope, J Baxter, P Lufkin\nHockey\nIC vs Harrow Town Swans 4\u20144\nDespite losing our goalie to the\n2nd XI, and only managing to\nfield 10 men the thirds put in a lot\nof effort to achieve a fair result.\nReplacement keeper Vernon\nMorris made some courageous\nsaves and was very well\nsupported (as ever) at the back\nby capt Chris Harrison and guest\nMark Cubitt. All the forwards,\nMarcus Shephard, Per Dillforce,\nTim Allen and Ian Mace, earned\nthemselves a goal each. Thanks\ngo to John the Swan for making\nup the numbers.\nTeamVernon Morris, Chris\nHarrison, Mark Cubitt, Craig\nHoney, John spencer, Ian Mace,\nMarcus Shepherd, Tim Allen,\nPer Dillforce, Steve Brooker\nIC Indoor Hockey vs Hampstead, Hounslow, Eastcote\nHaving previously decided that\nscores of 0\u201410 would probably\nbe quite respectable, the IC\nindoor 'squad' left for Harlington\nsports centre in a somewhat\nnervous mood. The draw for the\nnational K.O. had not been very\nkind, pitting us against 3 very\nstrong sides. The games proved\nto be useful experience for a side\nthat had never played together.\nThe first game, vs hampstead,\nwas very tight in the first half with\ncollege defending well; and saw\nthe sides level at 1\u20141 at half\ntime. In the second half the\nopposition overwhelmed a somewhat bedraggled defence to\nfinally win 5\u20141. The second\ngame, against the strongest of\nthe three sides (Hounslow), gave\nan equally close first half with Phil\nscoring a flick at one end and\nanother being saved at the other.\nThe start of the second half saw\ncollege take a surprise 3\u20142 lead\nonly to be finally overcome by a very experienced side 5\u20143.

    "content": "OPINION!]\nGraham Brown \u2014 Loan Ranger\nThe last 20 years have witnessed much debate in the field of\nGovernment policy towards higher education, and in particular the\nfinancing of students at universities and polytechnics. There is now a growing movement amongst both students and academics to question\nthe principles which underlie some of the reports of enquiries into\nhigher education undertaken by previous governments. This article\nsets out Graham Brown's views in favour if the introduction of a loans\nscheme for financing students to replace the present inadequate system\nof means-tested grants.\nBackground\nThe two reports which have since become the\nfoundation of current policy towards financing\nstudents are the Anderson report of 1960,\nestablishing the principle of awarding a grant as of\nright to every student who is accepted for a first\ndegree course; and the Robbins report of 1963\nwhich recommended that courses of higher\neducation should be available for all those qualified\nto pursue them.\nSeveral factors now force a reappraisal of these\n(hitherto) guiding lights. First, the underlying\nphilosophy of the present Government toward\nrolling back the frontiers of state socialism, and to\nrestore freedom and responsibility to the\nindividual. Already we have witnessed the longstanding moves towards making overseas\nstudents bear a greater proportion of the costs of\ntheir education. Should not all students, not\nmerely those from overseas, shoulder more of the\nresponsibility for their education themselves?\nSecondly, this Government is committed to 'firm\ncontrol of public spending' as stated in the\nConservative Manifesto of 1983, and since\nEducation now accounts for some \u00a313 billion of\npublic expenditure it cannot be considered\nunworthy of consideration. The statistic is\naccentuated by the increase in the student\npopulation due to the higher birth rate of the\n1960s, and the greater disposition of those in sixth-forms to continue their educational studies on a full-time basis. While British opinion in the past has\nbeen inflexibly opposed to the principle of student\nloans, with both the leadership of the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) and the Association of\nUniversity Teachers being against the idea, recent\nresearch by educational economists have fuelled\nthe growing movement amongst students in\nfavour of a loans scheme.\nThe failings of the present system\nThe intentions of the Anderson committee in the\ndirection of a more equal social distribution\namongst students was commendable, but the\ngrant system, rather than providing the necessary\nimpetus to encourage a greater diver is ty of social\nbackgrounds has merely preserved the position of\n20 years ago. If one looks at the occupation of a student's father as an indication of social class, less\nthan 1\n% of students come from a manual worker\nbackground; a proportion that has remained\napproximately constant since 1951. Clearly higher\neducation has not become more available, and\nindeed the reverse may be argued when we\nconsider the number of full-time students in Britain\nhas increased by 260% in the period 1951-80.\nHaving established that the aim of higher\neducation financing is to make it more widely\navailable, it now appears that the present grants\nsystem is the least equitable method.\nAt present the primary objection to the grants\nby students is their inherent heavy reliance upon\nthe continued financial support of their parents,\nwho often resent being expected to finance those\nwho, although still dependant, are over what the\nstate has declared to be the age of majority. It is\nevident from various surveys undertaken recently\nthat a very large number of parents either can not\nor do not make up the grant to the recommended\nlevel (A recent NUS survey revealed that over 60%\nof parents fail to meet their financial obligations).\nWhile some are unwilling to pay their\ncontribution, many more are simply unable to do\nso. The present system of assessing parental\ncontributions on the basis of earnings 18 months in\nthe past fails to take account of change in\ncircumstances, while the disincentive effects of the\nrise in marginal tax rates due to the system of\nmeans testing the grant (estimated at over 60%)\nleads to as it a uti on where many students suffer\nfinancial hardship when their parents fail to pay\ntheir contribution, resulting in many students\nhaving to survive on an income below the so-called\n'poverty line'.\nNot only has the present grant system failed to\nmeet its original objectives, but in practice it has\ncontributed to the poor image of higher education\namong the public. The present system has little\nsupport from the taxpayer , and there is the r fore a clear political advantage to be derived from a change to a loans system It is widely believed that\nstudents are 'having it easy' at the taxpayer's expense, and such a view will obviously remain\nwhile the evidence continues to show that the\nchildren of higher income earners are being\nsub sidi sed through government grants by the\ntaxes from those with less income, and whose\nchildren have either no wish to take advantage of\nhigher education, or who lack the academic ability\nto do so.\nThe Case for Loans\nThe inadequacy of the present system has been\ndemonstrated, and this tends to increase the wide\ndiscrepancies in the financial requirements of\nstudents. For example, those at different\nestablishments face widely differing costs for the\nnecessities of life such as accommodation\u2014a student in Glasgow may well find it as expensive, if\nnot more so, than in London. The course subject\nmay also determine the level of student\nexpenditure, for while the science student is faced\nwith the purchase of a wider range of typically\nmore expensive text books and often has to\npurchase special equipment, his colleague on an\narts course without such heavy expenditure will\nreceive the same grant. A loans scheme would\nthe r fore enable a closer correlation between a student's needs and his income to be established-.\nThe mandatory grant, free of parental\ncontribution is often proposed by the NUS as a method of student financing. Yet this is completely\nunrealistic in the current economic climate and\ngiven the not inconsiderable benefit a student\nreceives from his education there is a clear case for\nhim to meet the cost of it himself. Britain is in a distinct minority for retaining a grant system, and\namongst other Western nations operating loans\nthere is a wide measure of student support for\nsuch a scheme.\nUnder a loans scheme, education would be\nviewed as an investment for the student and the\nshift in responsibility from state to student\ninherent in such a scheme would tend to result in a greater commitment to studies. Instances of NUS\nmilitancy and student discontent would be\nreplaced by more civilised behaviour in a sound\nacademic environment. A loan would provide an\nefficient means for market forces to determine the\nsupply and demand for higher education places by\nencouraging students to follow courses for which\nthere are more opportunities in graduate\nemployment, for example the sciences and\nengineering at the expense of non-vocational\nsubjects.\nIt is often suggested that there would be no\nincentive for a potential student to undertake a higher education course under a loans scheme\nbecause of his obligations to incur debt, which,\nespecially among st due nts from a low-income\nbackground, he may be unable to repay at a later\ndate. In practice given the ready availability of\nfunds for loans on acceptable terms, low-income\nstudents would be as willing to borrow as higher\nincome students.\nDetails, of a loans scheme are complex, but the\nrecent work by Lewis, Sandford and Thomson\nincorporates a survey of student and public\nopinion and presents a suitable framework on\nwhich to model a loans scheme in practice. The\nsurvey indicates substantial support for a government backed scheme with zero or low real\nrates of interest, a feature common to the many\nloans schemes operating in Europe. The report\nestimates that such a scheme could be self-financing in a relatively short period of time, and\nhence enable real savings to be made in the\neducation budget in the long term. The study\nrecommended that loans should be re payed only\nafter an initial four year moratorium on payment,\nand not until a certain minimum income had been\nreached. Even then it would be calculated that loan\nrepayment would add only an extra 5-10% to agra du te's tax contribution, with the likelihood\nbeing that employers, realising that graduates\nwere funding their own education, making\nappropriate adjustments in remuneration levels,\nleaving little net financial penalty with the\ngraduate. Clearly these figures are only indicative,\nbut they do show that an excessive burden would\nnot be placed on the undergraduate commencing\na course of study.\nWhile loans require a different administrative\nsystem to grants, the potential cost of bureaucracy\ncited by its opponents may be overstated since it\nwould be feasible, as in Denmark and the USA, for\nthe commercial banks (who have well established\nfacilities for individual loans) to administrate a student loans scheme on behalf of the\ngovernment.\nConclusions\nThe findings of the Anderson and Robbins\nCommittees are now over 20 years old and still we\nsee no greater equality in the social background of\nstudents. The means tested grant has reinforced\nrather than broken down the social barriers to\neducation. There is great resentment by students\ntowards continued dependance upon their\nparents and in many cases the parental\ncontribution is not paid in full. The inflexibility of\nthe present system further results in considerable\nfinancial hardship for many students.\nApart from loans there are two alternatives to\nthe means-tested grant; namely mandatory grants\n(both politically and economically unrealistic), or a voucher system which has already been\ndiscounted by the present government. A loans\nscheme therefore represents the only viable\nalternative to grants.\nThe present system, while failing to meet its\noriginal objectives, is undermining higher\neducation by imposing an ever increasing strain on\nthe educational budget. A loans scheme offers\nfinancial benefits to both students and central and\nlocal government, and as such the means tested\ngrant should be abolished.\nThe merits of the loan scheme, independance,\nresponsibility and self-determination, are deep-rooted pillars of Conservatism and as such I urge\nthe Government to include the abolition of the\nmeans-tested grant as part of its programme to roll\nback the frontiers of state socialism. The present\nsystem cannot be justified to those who believe in\nmarket forces and individual freedom. I urge the\nSecretary of State for Education and Science to\nabolish the grant system and introduce student\nloans at the earliest possible opportunity.\nFELIX Friday 2 November 5\n\n"

There has been a very slow\ntrickle of barrier cards returned but I could really do with a lot more\n- please bring them back.\n1. That the real level of student grants has steadily declined under successive\ngovernments.\n2. That since the reports of the Anderson and Robbins Committees of Enquiries\ninto Higher Education, the proportion of students from 'working class'\nbackgrounds has remained constant at less than 1% of the total number of\nstudents in full-time higher education in the United Kingdom.\n3. The current grant system is an effective barrier to entry into higher\neducation amongst 18-24 year olds.\n4. Recent studies indicate wide dissatisfaction amongst students and their\nparents towards the grants system.\nICU Believes:\n1. The present system of means-tested grants has failed to meet its objective\nof achieving a fairer distribution of social classes in higher education.\n2. The introduction of a loans scheme will result in wider access to higher\neducation.\n3- The grant system perpetuates the image of the student as yet another social\nparasite clam our ing for tax-payers money.\n4. Student loans are in line with the NUS policy of greater independance for\nstudents.\nICU Instructs:\n1. ICU President to inform the Secretary of State for Education and Science of\nthe views of IC Union on this subject.\n2. ICU delegation to ULU GUC to put forward this motion at the earliest possible\nopportunity.\n* # * * *\nMOTION ON REFECTORY PRICES.\nProposed by: Hugh Southey.\nSeconded by: J. Martin Taylor.\n1. That until the end of last year refectory price increases were fixed\naccording to the Financial Times 'shopping basket' index.\n2. That since then the Financial Times has ceased to publish a 'shopping basket*\nindex.\n3- That no alternative system of determining the increased cost of food and\nconsequent refectory price increases has yet been introduced.\n4. That despite this there have been two increases of 2% each in the refectories\nso far this year.\n5. That a computerized accounting system is planned for the refectories, but\nthere have been protracted delays in introducing it.6. That such a computerized system would be capable of calculating the real\nincrease in food costs to the refectories over a given period, so that price\nincreases could be based on actual increase in costs rather than on\nspeculative estimates.\n7. That the arguments put forward by Union representatives on the Refectory\nCommittee that the recent increases cannot be justified were totally ignored.\nICU Believes:\n1. That the College must have some logical system of determining what refectory\nprice increases should be, and that relying on guesswork is simply not good\nenough.\n2. That the recent price increases are arb it ary and hence unjustified, since\nthe College has no method of determining the increase in the cost of buying\nfood.\n3. That it is gross in com pet ance that the computerized accounting system for the\nrefectories is still not in operation several years after it was decided to\nintroduce it.4. That until a proper method of determining the actual increases in food costs\nis adopted, preferably based on the computerization of the accounts, there\nshould be no further price rises in the refectories at all. ICU Instructs:\n1. Its representatives on Refectory Committee to press the College to adopt a sensible system of determining price increases based on actual food costs,\npreferably by the speedy introduction of the computerized accounting system;\nand to strongly oppose any increase in refectory prices until such a system\nis introduced.\n2. That in the event of a further increase being imposed before such a system\nis introduced, the Officers of the Union shall organise a series of lightening\nrefectory boycotts by picketing selected outlets, distributing leaflets\nexplaining the reasons for the boycott and persuading people intending to use\nthe refectory to eat elsewhere.\n3- That such boycotts are to be organised at the rate of at least one each\nCollege week, until the situation is satisfactorily resolved to cover one\nopening period of one refectory for one day each week. The details of each\nboycott are to be decided in secret by the President after consultation with\nother Officers, with the College receiving no advance warning of the time or\nplace.\n4. The President to write to the Chairman of the Refectory Committee to inform\nhim of this policy.\nICU Requests:\nAll its members not to eat in any refectory which is at that time the target of a Union organised boycott, and to urge others not to do so.\n\n"

One computer needs to communicate with another down a phone line using an 'alphabet' of the 5 letters A, B,C,D, and E. Unfortunately there is a roughly 50% chance of the transmitted\nletter being corrupted, and received as the next letter in the\nalphabet (ie A becomes B,B becomes C... and E becomes A). To\novercome this problem we must define five pairs of letters such\nthat when one pair is transmitted (one letter after the other), the\nreceiving computer will be able to distinguish which of the five\npairs was sent without possibility of error.\nAll entries should be handed in to the FELIX Office by 5.30pm on Friday 9 November.\nGRADE3 There were many different solutions to last fortnight's puzzle.The clue to 29 down\u2014(cc) evoked three different\nsolutions\u2014seduce, recede and sean ce, all of equal merit.\nSeduce was the one I was looking for and is perhaps slightly\nmore apt than the other two.Of the six correct solutions I A Fagandini was the lucky winner and may collect his \u00a35 cheque\nfrom the Felix Office.\nPOTATO CURRY AND RICE\nThis is what I call a 'rent week' recipe: it will stuff two adults for\nabout 60p. First, the rice. When Japanese sailors were fed white rice they all developed beri-beri, warts, and never played the violin again.\nNevertheless, brown rice is always soggy, ugly, takes ages to\ncook and is either mushy or chewy, so I use Basmati rice, which\nis the tastiest of the white rices.\nPerfect rice is simple; 11\n/4 measures of water to one measure\nof rice. As a rough guide, a half-pint glass filled with uncooked\nrice grains is enough for a family of four.\nRinse under running water for one minute. Drain and put in a saucepan with a lid. Add 11\n/4 measures of water, put the lid on\nand bring to the boil. Immediately turn the heat off and leave for\neight minutes. Stir briefly to fluff it up and serve with curry.\n11\n/2 lbs of potatoes, sliced, two medium onions, sliced,\ndessert spoon of curry powder, 1\n/2 bar of coconut cream (from\nany supermarket or Indian grocer's), and a tablespoon of\ncooking oil.\nFry the onions in the oil until they begin to brown. Add the rest\nof the ingredients, stir and almost cover with water. Boil in an\nopen saucepan for about fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally,\nuntil most of the water has evaporated. Serve.\n4 Friday 2 November FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Founded 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nSir Henry\nslams Rector\nParts of the Rector's Commemoration Day Speech were\nattacked by the Chairman of the Governing Body, the Hon\nSir Henry Fisher in his closing speech.\nThe main points of the\nRector's speech were the hopes of\nearly implementation of A Slevels designed to broaden the Alevel curriculum, and the entry of\nmore women into Science and\nengineering. Sir Henry had\n' grave misgivings about broadening the sixth form\ncurriculum'. Although it was\npopular to talk about wide\nranging studies in the arts and the\nsciences, he thought that the\ncurrent A Level system provided\nstudents who were 'well prepared\nfor a university course of only\nthree years'. He felt that any\nchange in the system would be a disaster if they provided ill\nprepared students and universities had to bring them up\nto standard.\nTurning to the entry of more\nwomen into science and\nengineering, Sir Henry felt that\nthe Rector was emphasising the\nrecruitment in a way that was\nitself sexist. Sir Henry suggested\nthat the way to attract women\nwas not to treat them as women\nbut, in the same way as men, as\nhuman beings. He felt that a good way of implementing this\nchange might begin at\nCommemoration Day itself. At\npresent when students are\npresented to him the chairman of\nthe Governing Body nods his\nhead to men and raises his hat to\nwomen. Sir Henry wondered\nhow long this tradition would\ncontinue.\nThe Rector had no comment to\nmake on Sir Henry's speech.\nMajor\nprojects\nA major projects symposium has\nbeen organised by the Old\nCentralians Association of the\nCity and Guilds College on the\ntopic of 'Securing Britain's Future'. It will take place in the\nSherfield Building on January 4\n1985.\nThe Rector, Lord Flowers, will\nintroduce the day's programme,\naimed at creating a better climate\nto allow beneficial developments\nin the UK. Large scale\nengineering projects as well as a range of smaller ones will be\ndiscussed. Their funding will be\nanalysed as well as the way they\ncan be carried out to make a contribution to the UK economy.\nThe keynote speaker will be\nNorman Lamont MP, Minister\nof State for Industry, and the\nsessions will be chaired by Lord\nEzra MBE and David Crouch\nMP, Chairman of the All Party\nGroup for Energy Studies.\nThe closing date for registration is 3 December and\nmembers of staff wishing to\nattend can do so at the reduced\nrate of \u00a350. Any students who\nwishing to attend should apply to\nProf J Munro, Head of the Civil\nEngineering Department.\nRegistration forms will be\nincluded in FELIX on November\n16.\nGowerStreetSquat\nUniversity students squatting in a disused University of London\nExamination Office building as\nthey have nowhere- else to live,\nare protesting about the lack of\naccommodation provided by the\nUniversity.\nFifty students, mainly from\nLSE and UCL moved into the\nbuilding in Gower Street on\nOctober 16, using an open\nwindow. The building had been\nvacant since last December, but\nwas carpeted and well maintained. Owned by the\nUniversity, negotiations were\nunderway to sell or rent it out.\nThe University, although\nsympathetic to accommodation\nproblems in general, have denied\nthat the situation is any worse\nthan in past years. Following\ndiscussions with the colleges and\nunions concerned as well as\nstudents involved in the squat,\nthe University has agreed to a joint enquiry with UL U. This will\nlook at accommodation in a wider context and will present a report to the Department of\nEducation and Science. A Spokesman for the University\nsaid that the Colleges concerned\nhad already offered short-term\nemergency accommodation to\nthe students in addition to\ncounselling and help in finding\npermanent accommodation. He\nstressed that although legal\naction was a possibility there was\nno deadline by which the\nstudents should leave the squat.\nIn a Press Statement, the\nsquatters claim the occupation to\nbe a 'needs issue', and not\npolitically motivated. Smaller\nrooms would be used for long\nterm accommodation, and larger\noffices (600 sq ft) as a short term\ncrash pad. They also intend to\nrun an accommodation advice\nbureau. The occupation has\nalready been given unanimous\nsupport at LSE and UCL Union\nMeetings and a lobby of Senate\nHouse took place on Wednesday. The Squatters would\nwelcome student support,\nespecially in occupying the\nbuilding during the day. The\nsquat is at 66 to 72 Gower Street,\nnear Dillons.\nAn IC contingent attended the C ND rally at Barrow-in-Furness over the\nweekend.\nThe 20,000 C ND supporters were protesting at the government's plans\nto build the new generation of nuclear submarines at the Vickers yard,\nwhich provides employment for nearly one in five of the town's population.\nFree!

Having preconceived ideas or knowledge\nof the plot can often spoil a film or its 'stunning' effect.\nThis film is not however one of those cases.\nThe plot follows the, almost\nsoap opera type, story of a small Brazilian town, ll he us in\nthe 1920s. There is a colonial\npower of Spanish upper class,\nbut the times are changing.\nThe start of promiscuity and\nan insignificant sub-plot of\npolitical upheaval and murder. The town is made up\nbasically of 1) women who\nspend all their time trying to\nget the men, 2)the working\nmen like school teachers and\nbar owners and 3) the\ncolonels who make up the rest of the upper class men and\nspend their time drinking in\nthe bar.\nLife was simple in those\ndays. The only rule was that\nthe husband should always\nkill his wife and lover when he\nfinds them together.\nMarcello Mastroianni is the\nbar owner (a well know\nSpanish actor) who takes on\nas his new cook Sonia Braga\nwho although unheard of here\nis a famous Brazilian Sex\nSymbol (although starting to\nage). Their love is sea thing and intensely physical. There\nis little of the mental torment\nof love conveyed here.\nThe whole film however has\na strange pensive atmosphere\nthat conveys the romance yet\nnot the harsh violence of this\ntypical Brazilian town( Glamour again). It is hard to\npin down this atmosphere but\nit seems mainly due to the\nmusic. Apart from one or two\nsongs the background music\n( although not always appropriate) is wonderful.\nBringing to mind films like\nDeath in Venice and Merry\nXmas Mr Lawrence where the\nmusic does not seem to fit but\nis so good that it adds to the\nfilm in its own right. Antonio\nCarlos Job in, another Brazilian, wrote the music. His\nsong 'Girl from Ipanema'\nmight mean more to you I don't know. Enjoyable, but I know some people don't like\nreading sub-titles take your\nglasses.\nFELIX\nDee C Lee: Don't Do It Baby\nI thought 'Selina Wow Wow'\nwas brilliant, and when this\none came into the office, I was\nhoping for more of the same.\nUnfortunately though, the\nrecord company has clearly\ndecided 'Selina' wasn't Funky\nenough, and has released this\nprimarily as a club record. It'd be great on the dance floor,\nbut for listening to ? Nah!\nKim Wilde: The Second Time\nComposed and produced\nby daddy \u2014 Marty Wilde \u2014\nKim attempts to get back the\nsuccess 'Kids In America'\nbrought. The difference is,\nthat 'KIA' had a great tune,\ninfinite energy, and ok lyrics.\nThe Second Time' has none\nof these. In fact, I suspect the\nonly people buying this will do\nso purely for the picture\nsleeve: incredible high heels!\nThe Alarm: The Chant\nThis reminds me of\nsomething else, but I can't quite put my finger on it.\nMaybe it's just one of those\ngreat songs that sound 'old'\neven before you've heard\nthem. I loved 'The Stand', but\nsince then, The Alarm have\nproduced very same y singles.\nAnd how can anyone hope to\nget a political message across\nwith words like 'Weialala le la, well a la'? Paul Young: I'm Gonna Tear\nYour Playhouse Down\nI have a soft spot for Paul\nYoung, having 'got into' his\nmusic long before it was\ntrendy to do so. Also this new\nsingle has my favourite PY\nsong \u2014'Broken Man' \u2014 on the\nflip of the 12 inch. However,\ndespite numerous listens, the\nA \u2014side fails to impress. His\nvoice is as excellent as ever,\nbut the song is basically duff.\nStreetheart: Snow White.\nStreetheart are a Canadian\nHM band (so that's why you\nhaven't heard of them!!) who\nare trying to break into the\nBritish Music Scene. Unfortunately, they plan-to do\nthis by mellowing their rock,\nand adding random 'Sha Na\nNa's'. At least that's what it\nseems like. Canadian rock has\na lot to offer. This is not it!\nQuite often I ask for people's comments on new titles.\nRecently I have asked certain\nmembers of the administration staff. Their reactions\nare enlightening. Top of the\nlist is 'Maia', ' HG Wells in love'\nand of course, a certain popup book, which can be kept in\nmy office for collection. I wonder if one's reading likes\nand dislikes should betaken\ninto account when recruiting\nnew staff?\nNew Titles - Hardback\nMaia \u2014 Richard Adams \u2014\nViking \u00a312.95\nMexico set \u2014 Len Deighton \u2014\nHutchinson \u00a38.95\nJob \u2014 a comedy of justice \u2014\nRobert A Heinlein \u2014 NEL \u00a38.95\nThe first dance of freedom \u2014\nMartin Meredith \u2014 Hamish\nHamilton \u00a312.95\nThe Fourth Reich \u2014\nLinklacer, Hilton &Ascherson\n\u2014 Hodder & Stoughton \u00a39.95\nSo much love \u2014 Beryl Reid \u2014\nHutchinson \u00a33.95\nHit me again \u2014 Jack Aspinwall MP \u2014 Buchan &\nEnright \u00a34.50\nTimes Diary cartoons \u2014 Barry\nFantoni \u2014 Blond \u00a34.95\nNot many people know that \u2014\nMichael Caine \u2014 Robson\n\u00a36.95\nPaperback\nJolliffe & Mayle \u2014 Pan \u00a32.95\nThe field bedside book \u2014\nWilson Stephens \u2014 Robson\n\u00a33.95\nThe Royal shopping guide \u2014\nNina Grunfeld \u2014 pan \u00a35.95\nThe transfer \u2014 Thomas Palmer \u2014- Fontana \u00a31.95\nWorldly goods \u2014 Michael\nKorda \u2014 Corgi \u00a31.95\nThe secret keeper \u2014 Shirley\nEskapa \u2014 Pavanne \u00a31.75\nBlind prophet \u2014 Bart Davis \u2014\nfontana \u00a31.95\nJurgen \u2014 James Branch Cabell \u2014 Allen & Unwin \u00a32.95\nThe war lord \u2014 Malcolm\nBossie \u2014 Fontana \u00a32.95\nChains of fate \u2014 Pamela Belle\n\u2014 Pan \u00a32.95\nNothing to lose \u2014 Consuelo\nBaehr \u2014 Pan \u00a31.75\nHas anyone seen an internal\ntelephone? Five weeks ago at\ngreat inconvenience to myself\nand my staff, a cable was laid\nbetween my\" office and Katherine Choi's office. She\ndeals with an enormous number of customer orders,\nbut as yet we haven't had a phone connected. As this\nmost excellent paper is read\nby most, I wonder if one of\neither our own telephone\nengineers or BT's could help.\n~T Gabriela-played by Sonia Braga-a well known Brazilian\nSex Symbol? Great music, but don't forget to take your\nglasses, the film is in Brazilian with subtitles.\nFriday 2 November\n\n"
