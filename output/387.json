After all, that\nletter pressed square of blotting paper is all you need\nto become an instant success in Gradland, night?\nBut enough of this pondering as to which part of your\nanatomy will receive the gloriously climactic 'rubber\nstamp', let's examine what effect this stunningly\nconscientious pen-pushing MIGHT have on the Union.\nTautological Iy speaking, an approximate estimate\nwould be:- apathy escalation and participation minimal\ngenerally creating nauseous pains in the rear all round.\nBut whilst the summer term inevitably remains\npsychologically jading, the issues facing students\nremain the same but now they are seasonally stronger\ndue to the dwindling opposition.

This Easter,\nNick Easby (our skipper),\nAndrew MC Far laine, Martyn\nWells, Carol Workman and I, all decided to sail to Cherbourg\nduring the Easter Vac. Carol\nstarted most efficiently by\nbuying \u00a320 worth of food only\nto find that, on arriving at the\nmarina, the boys had also bought the food!(Have your ever heard of a boat going for only a week stacked with 3 chickens,50 eggs, and 101b of butter?)\nWe set off on Sunday (after\nhaving stopped off at Itchenor\nfor \" light refreshment\"). The sea was amazingly calm, and I remember thinking (as it was my first time under sail), that\nperhaps sailing was rather\nboring. It was not long before\nmy suspicions were definitely\nproved wrong!\nSuddenly early Monday\nmorning the winds had changed\nand were blowing at least a force 6 . When we were in sight\nof the French coast our Storm\nJib( sail!) blew out and we were forced to turn back, hoping\nthe gale, (which was by now a steady force 8), would die down. However it didn't! The boat was swaying at 90 degree\nangles every other second, and\nwaves were breaking over us. At this point one became\n\u2022somewhat bemused by the\nsituation! We had given the loo\nup as a bad job., jane found it\nimpossible to stay on it, let\nalone do anything on it! For us\ngirls sheer desperation enabled\nus to cast away any inhibitions!\nAfter 48 hours at sea we\nwere far from healthy - (I never\nrealised a washing up bowl\ncould have so many uses!!). We\nwere basically tired, cold, wet,\nand sick( The presence of so much food didn't help!). So, we decided to send off distress\nflares. Almost immediately a French Merchant Ship turned\ntowards us, and when it was within hearing distance, a rather confused \"frog gy man\"\nshouted \"Zee 'eli copter e eez\ncome eng.\" After this spirits were raised. The helicopter\narrived and a pilot, who found\nit rather difficult to land on the\nboat, eventually dec ended on to\nthe stern head seaward! He had\nplanned to take us girls off,\nbut, on seeing the state of the\nboys, decided to leave us all together. Hows that for an ego\nboost! An hour later Andrew\nannounced that a huge Royal\nNavy Destroyer had arrived and\na life-boat was making its way\ntowards us. Four of us were\ntaken off Icky (our yacht), to\nthe Destroyer, leaving Nick behind to brief the new scratch\ncrew for Icky.\nWe were hauled up on to The HMS Sheffield (the destroyer),\nonly to be greeted by 300\nuniformed sailors with cameras!\nApparently the fact that there\nwere 2 girls on board had\ncaused quite a stir! From this\nmoment on we were treated\nroyally. We were presented with\nblankets, coffee, brandy, and\nnew gear. At one stage I had\nthree officers undressing me-Hows that for service??! We\nhad hot showers and were all taken to the Ward Room to be\ngiven a huge meal. Two of the\ncrew had been ordered to vacate\ntheir cabin so that Carol and\nI could sleep. We collapsed on\nthe bed only to find them\ncomplete with water bottles!\nWe spent a day on the ship and\nwere taken round everywhere!\nSome of the crew wrote us a poem which we answered, only\nto find it published in the\n\"Portsmouth News\" when we\ngot back!\nIt is so easy to revel in the\nexcitement and forget all the\ninconvenience and expense we\ncaused. Still we most sincerely\nthank all those involved, and\non the part of the crew, do not\nforget our highly competent\nskipper!\nPROF. BR EMS ST RAH LUNG EUREKA! K Dammit man! Sfly\nSOMETHING!

    "content": "4 FELIX\nSTATEMENT OF COLLEGE POLICY\nA. The present position It has long been College policy to protect the safety of its\nmembers, visitors, neighbours and the public generally within\nor near its premises to the fullest extent that is practicable.\nMeasures in use to achieve this include:-a) the proper provision and maintenance of buildings,\nlaboratories, plant, services and equipment;\nb) the provision and maintenance of safe means of\nescape and of access by emergency services, and\nthe practice of emergency drills; c) the provision and maintenance of alarm systems\nand fire fighting equipment;\nd) the provision of information, instruction, training\nand supervision in safety procedures;\ne) the provision of safety rules, the enforcement of\nstringent conditions in respect of hazardous work,\nand the supply of protective equipment.\nThe good sense and technical competence of individual members of staff contribute significantly to the prevention of a cci dents and injury. The College, corporate ly, seeks to promote awareness of the importance of safety. The organisation which exists to deal with matters of safety, health and welfare at work operates through five College committees, which are advisory to the\nRector.\nThe College Safety Committee consists of various specialists drawn from the academic and technical staff, and has student re-presentation. It reviews College procedures, issues Codes of\nPractice, investigates accidents, advises on the lessons to be\nlearnt from them, briefs Departmental Safety Officers, arranges\n-lectures and gives publicity to information on safety . The College Chief Maintenance Officer, Fire Officer and Laser Officer are\nmembers of this Committee. A Field Station Safety Committee performs a similar function on a scale commensurate with the act iv i ties at the Field Station. '\u2022 All work involving hazards of ionizing radiation is controlled\nby the Radiation Safety Committee and the College Health Phys ici st in accordance with the College Code of Practice and in\ncompliance with statutory requirements. Safety at the Nuclear\nReactor is supervised by the Reactor Safety Committee.\nArrangements for medical attention within the College are\nsupervised by the Medical Services Committee. Three part-time\nMedical Officers and three full-time nurses staff the Health\nCentre which provides medical and sick bay services for stud-ents. Opthalmic and psychiatric treatments are also arranged.\nThe Centre provides cover for the treatment of accidents during\nworking hours and gives medical advice to all staff who seek it,\nbut is not allowed to prescribe treatment except in emergencies.\nInnoculations are provided free for all staff. The Centre is also concerned with advising and monitoring on occupational health\nproblems.\nThe Student Counsellor provides professional advice on we l fare and on personal problems. Student Welfare is the particular\nconcern of certain members of the academic staff who are\nappointed as tutors .\nWithin this general framework the day-to-day Implementation\nof safety requirements is in the hands of the departments, operating through a Departmental Safety Committee and/or one or\nmore Departmental Safety Officers. They are responsible for supervision of Safety precautions, provision of safety equipment and\nFirst Aid Equipment appropriate to the needs of each department\nand for Information and publicity .\nB. New Developments in Safety Policy College provisions in the field of Safety and Health have evolved continuously to meet changing requirements and situations .\nThe Health and Safety at Work etc. Act(1974) provides an important new national stimulus in this area, which calls for a positive\nresponse.\n\\nsw ers to Prize Crossword\nNo . 1 5\nThe winner of Prize Crossword No. 15 was ft.Garnett,\nBotany 2, who receives the \u00a31\nprize.\nNOTICE\nNUS Vacation bulletins ace\nported on the notice boards,\nin the Union lobby and .ICR.\nACROSS\n1 Sals site 5.

The\nreview now being undertaken will cover general safety policy,\nthe arrangements for expert advice and supervision, and the methods of practical implementation at departmental level. It is\nexpected to lead to a strengthening and extension of current\nprovisions for safety; to the establishment of more formal machinery for consultation with all sections of the College community;\nand to the adoption of a Code of Safety as a development of the\nexisting College Safety manuals.\nWith the co-operation of all groups of College members further progress will be made towards the common aim of combining\nefficient working with the fullest possible protection of safety\nand health.\nM.J..

HAMLET GARDENS\nSHOCK\n\"CLIQUE PERPETUATIONALLEGATIONS MADE\nRESIDENTS IN Hamlet Gardens could be in for a shock\nregarding their re applications to reside there during the\n1975/76 session. It appears that residents have been\npromised places during the forth coming session by the\nWarden of Hamlet Gardens dependent on whether they had\n\"behaved well\" this year.\nMORE ON LANCASTER LAST WEDNESDAY, about 4000 students from all over\nthe country marched the four miles from Lancaster's City\ncentre to the University campus where a rally was held'.\nOver fifty student unions from as far away as Bath, Swansea,\nLiverpool, Southampton, Aberdeem and East Anglia (whose\nStudents yesterday occupied part of their campus in support\nof the Lancaster Students) attended the march and rally to\npledge their support for the victimised Lancaster students'.\nCharles Clarke, the NUS president-elect, led the march\nand spoke at the rally. In his speech he urged student unions\nup and down the country to\nstand together in the fight\nagainst victim is ation and especially to fight the educational cuts which were the root\ncause of most student problems.\n\"This demonstration has\narisen out of the decision of\none man \u2014 vice-Chancellor\nCharles Carter \u2014 to make his\nstudents pay for the Government's financial sabotage of\nhigher education\", he said. He also urged all vice-chancellors\nto dissociate themselves from\nthe action of Charles Carter.\nSeveral speakers from other\nstrife-torn campuses spoke at\nthe rally and all demanded that\nthe sentences be quashed. The\nstudent body at Lancaster are\ndemanding that vice-chancellor\nCharles Carter should leave\nthe University. The Lancaster University\nStudents Union is nearly\nbankrupt because of the cost of\ntheir campaign against the\nUniversity authorities.

Dave Salisbury,\nthe Student Residence Officer,\nput forward proposals at the\nCouncil meeting on Monday\nnight that would essentially preserve this status quo for\nthis year thus setting up a' clique' of residents in Hamlet\nGardens.\nThe ensuing debate which\nfollowed saw Trevor Phillips, the ICU president, deliver a very strong speech conde m ming not only the action being taken\nover this issue which directly\ncontradicts Union policy but\nalso questioning Mr Salisbury' s stance on this issue. Mr Salisbury it seemed had\nsucceeded in misrepresenting\nthe initiatives taken by Mr\nPhillips and Mrs Gerrard on\nthis matter and implied, in his\nspeech, that through their\nactions, he had been placed in the invidious position of placing an article in FELIX regarding\nplaces in Hamlet Gardens,\nthat did not correctly explain\nthe existing situation on\nre applications. A working party is being set up to investigate the Hamlet\nGardens affair, although the\nquestion of who the members\nof this working party will be,\nhas been deferred to the next\nCouncil meeting. This will be\nthe Joint Council of Monday,\nJune 16th,1975. In the intermediate period, however, the\nUnion Executive will take the\nnecessary decisions concerning\nre applicants and new applicants due to the urgency involved. ;\nBoard proposes to institute\nsome research studentships and\nassociate ships at the Central Electricity Research Laboratories and to form a group with\nexisting Board staff undertaking\nbasic work in the field of stress corrosion with which Professor\nSwann will collaborate closely.

As the year has progressed it has become\nobvious that there is a body of opinion\namongst us that was not wholly satisfied\nwith what we saw as our intended role in\nindustry. Talking about problems is al ways useful, but there comes a time when\nthe only way to maintain one's conviction\nis to do something, and this is an explanation of what is wrong and what we are\ntrying to do.\nWe feel that the problem is best summarised by saying that, in general, there\nis insufficient consideration in industry\n(and the educational system) for the poli t ical, social, human and ecological consequences of Science and Technology.\nNow this in Itself is not a startling new\nrevelation but it is we who are being\ntrained to perpetuate and perfect this\nstate of affairs. We are aware that, of all people who could exert useful and property directed pressure we would be the\nbest equipped.\nThe process of evolution of our\nscheme can be summer is ed in a list of\npoints:-(a) Although technologists of all disc ip lines can often see the problems and\nconsequences of Science and Technology, they lack organisation and\npolitical muscle to implement their\nsolution.( b) The ow re otl y recognised organs of\nthe engineering world, the Institutes\nare ineffectual politically because of\ntheir charters which debar them from\npolitical activity. This is because\nthey are registered as charities. Steve Hinton\n(c) The lack of engineers in the membership of BSSRS indicates that it does\nnot cater for the industrial problems\nthat we would be concerned with. For\nexample, they can push for control of\ngenetic engineering whilst we concentrate on attacking \" built in obsolescence\". The ultimate goals are\nundoubtedly the same, but the field\nand direction of approach are very\ndifferent.\n(d)A new form of association is required\ntherefore that can not only provide\npolitical pressure to instigate change,\nbut equally vitally, can provide effective support for an individual member\nwho stands up for his principles and\nsuffers reprisals as a consequence.\nThis Intended trade-union type of\nrole is essential if individuals are to\nbe able to crit ize wherever they see fault, without being constrained b v 'company loyalty' or job security\nfears.\nNecessarily our aims are rather vague\nat the moment and we need to be out in\nindustry to be fully effective. We are not,\nhowever, completely without experience\nas the vast majority of us have spent a year in industry before coming to college. We are organising ourselves within our\ncollege and contacting other universities\nto involve like-minded people. Although\nit was engineers who initiated this move-ment, we feel that we can usefully work\nwith anyone with similar aims involved\nin industry regardless of qualifications. We would be delighted to hear from\nanyone with suggestions or who would\nlike to be involved. Anyone who is Interested should contact Simon Wilson, 3rd year undergraduate, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College of\nScience and Technology, London 9W7 "
