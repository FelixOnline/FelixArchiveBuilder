The number\nof companies attending was 63, not\nabout 7 0 , and indeed the\npresentation was superior to last\nyear. This obviously was a great\nbenefit to the companies. The students however had a small\nproblem. The3,000+( based on\nJeremy's figures) who attended the\nfirst day had 500 brochures between\nthem. These were being produced\nDear Adam,\nJust a small note to say a big\nthank you to the stewards that\nhelped me at this years Union\nCareers Fair, but especially to\nRichard Scott, Andrew Wensley,\nChristopher Stapleton and Steven\nNewhouse for all the hard work that\nthey put in to make the event run\nsmoothly.\nI have just read David Ensell's letter... I suppose he must have a grudge to bear given that he\nresigned from being joint careers\nfair manager with me this year, just\nbefore he was to be sacked. The\nlack of brochures was a problem on\nthe first day, due to an outside\ncompany not perfect binding them\nas quickly as they were supposed to.\nEven so, everyone that was without\na brochure, was still given a plan\nBoring\nDear Adam,\nRE: 'Bailey's back and boring as\never'. Felix letter pl5, Issue 913.\nFor boring, read vague, fuzzy,\nobscure etc.\nPerhaps Alan could write back\nand let us all know exactly what his\nletter was driving at.\nMethinks he was trying to be too\nclever. Either that or a private joke.\nYours ad na use um, Declan Curry.\nPS. New name for Felix? 'Claptrap'?\nby the print unit, but due to a problem, presumably were not\nready. A further 2,000 were\navailable on the second day, but this\nmeans some 5 6 % of those attending\nhad no information provided them.\nUnfortunate. Also please could you\nelaborate on the 'large amount of\nd is organisation preceding last\nyear's fair' and tell us in what way\nit made it far inferior to this year's, possibly by using the statistics of\nattendances etc.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Ensell, Careers Fair\nSteward 1991.\nof the stand layout. Unfortunate,\nbut not a disaster.\nAs for me saying that this year\nwas superior to last, this was a slight reporting error by Felix, and\nwas in fact said by a company\nrepresentative from Rolls-Royce.\nAnd as for the 'large amount of\nd is organisation preceding last\nyear's fair', I'm afraid that I haven't got the time, or space to write a500 word essay. If David cannot\nremember, then he should come and\nsee me at some time and I will\nremind him.\nAnyway, I hope that everyone\nthat came along looking for a job,\nfound something to their liking.\nYours sincerely.\nJeremy Burnell,\nCareers Fair Manager 1991.\nDear Adam (again),\nFirstly I would to say that my last\nletter to Felix was not meant to be\nat all rude. Of course you cannot\ncheck the spelling of everything in\nFelix, I don't expect you to. But as\nEditor you should be made aware\nwhen errors slip in, especially since\nyou are after all responsible for the\ncontent of Felix.\nIt should have been obvious to\nanyone reading my letter that it was\na blatant piece of club publicity,\nwhich I felt we deserved after the\nmistakes in Felix 912. I guess you\ncould describe my letter as ' na ff, whatever that means. However,\nDear Adam,\nOn Thursday 17 October 1991\nafter the Mathematics Freshers'\nDinner there was an attempt by\nC&G to steal Theta, the RCS mascot. In the ensuing confusion a first year member of the RCS mascot ry team was unfortunately\ninjured.\nFirst aid was administered by\nstudents and the St John's Ambulance (from the Albert Hall)\nuntil the ambulance arrived to take\nhim to hospital.\nIt is clear that the mascot ry within\nIC has lost sight of its original aim\nto raise money for Rag, and has\nDear Adam,\nAfter a number of incidents at last\nFriday's Spitfire gig in the union,\nI feel compelled to write on behalf\nof the Ents committee, everybody\nelse involved in running Ents events\nand the people who attend them.\nWhy do we constantly have to put\nup with the bloody minded behaviour of a small number of\npeople who seem to believe that\nthey enjoy some kind of priv il edged status within ICU, and as such are\nexempt from the normal standards\nof behaviour? I'm loath to point the\nfinger at specific bodies within\ncollege but most people at IC are\nfamiliar with the members of quasi-masonic tie clubs, certain sports\nclubs and CC Us to whom I refer.\nLet me put a few things straight:\nIf you want to get into an Ents\nevent, PAY, like everybody else\ndoes.

Stress's guide led him out\nof the ship and over the tongue\ntowards an air lock set in one of the\nteeth. As stress followed the ghostly\nglow of his guide's gum gear\nthrough the dim light, technicians\nand robots swarmed around the ship\nlike flies around dung, removing it\nso the reptile could continue\nfeeding.\nThe air lock opened on to a passage which wound down and\naround to a viewing area. Beyond\nthe tinted windows on one wall of\nthe passage, two wide tracks\nstretched off into the distance in a massive tunnel hung with bright\nultra-violet lights. Small tracks\ncame off the main two and\ndisappeared down passages on the\nright and left. Just below where they\nstood the two main tracks curved\naround and joined to form a massive\nrectangular circuit.\nSwarming up and down this\ntrack, over holes and ramps on\nstrange impractical wheeled contraptions, were thousands of\nheavily tanned young people\nwearing sports clothing and\nsunglasses.\n'Behold our masters.'\nThe guide swept his arm across\nthe view.\n'They're the rulers of this place?'\n'Definitely.'\n'So they tell you what to do?'' Ah, no. You misunderstand me.\nWe, the greys, organise things so\nthat the tanned ones can have the\nbest possible time.'\n'The guide smiled again. His\nteeth were bright and glaring in the\nlight from the track. He began\nwalking down the passage.\n'I 'll now take you to the central\ncomplex.'\nStress obediently followed.\nThe passage stepped into a wider\npassage lit and filled with identically\ngrey clothed people walking purposefully along. Signs and maps\nwere everywhere but Stress soon\nrealised that most of them\ncontradicted.\n' Why are half the signs wrong?'\n'If someone doesn't know the\nway then they don't have the right\ninformation and no one sane gives\naway free information. The signs\nare there to weed out the weak and\nindecisive.'\nThe guide followed signs marked\nrubbish pit and emerged on a platform stuffed with greys.\nThe guide cautioned Stress.\n' The train we are travelling on is\npowered by eye contact avoidance\nso please look away from faces for\nthe duration of the journey.'\nA train came out of the tunnel at\nthe end of the platform and slid to\na halt. They got on.\nSitting down inside the carriage\nStress felt very uncomfortable. He\nwas still in the bright blue and red\nspacesuit of Earth's space fleet and\nwas clashing so badly with the sea\nof grey uniforms around him he felt\nbruised. The train got going.\nGlancing around aimlessly Stress\nnoticed an attractive brunette a few\nseats along the carriage. He couldn't take his eyes off her and\nas the girl turned her head their eyes\nmet.\nThe train jolted and its contented\npurr was replaced by an annoyed\ngrumble. Its grumbles were echoed\nby grumbles in the carriage and\nsomeone further along the row\nshouted out.\n' Hey, geek! Wh addy a think\nyou're doing?!'\nThe brunette turned her head with\nan annoyed tut, Stress went red and\nstared at the ceiling where a sign\nread IN EYE AVOIDANCE EMERGENCY LOOK HERE. Underneath the words there were\nadvertisements so boring that he\nsoon cooled down.\nThe train pulled out of the tunnel\non to another underground platform. As the doors slid open an\nannouncer started speaking.\n' WE hg lak sergy. LA HE K RH. FGHSehglshgrtuihsdfk, f djs gh vre a seas.' Stress strained to listen but\ncould make nothing out.\n'What is it saying?'\nThe guide turned and smiled,\navoiding his gaze.\n'It's saying welcome to the\ncentral complex. Please avoid and\nignore everybody inside the lifts as\nthey are powered by eye contact and\nphysical contact avoidance.'\n'But I couldn't make anything\nout.'\n' Of course not. It's deliberately\nscrambled so that anyone who\ndoesn't know can't find out.\nBecause someone that doesn't know...'\n'I know the rest.'\nStress and his guide headed to the\nlifts and kept as far as possible away\nfrom everyone else until they were\nallowed out. A quick walk out\nthrough double doors and they were\nbefore the central complex.\n\n"

    "content": "25 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 914 Feature\nSince 1970, 90 people under 17 years of age have been sentenced to\ndeath in the USA. Lee Matthews, of IC's Amnesty International Group,\ncounts the cost of America's justice system.\nwhen under stress. (It was during\na rough body search of Dalton's elder brother Joseph, whom he\nidol is ed, when he shot the police\nofficer.) Dalton had been brought\nup by an alcoholic aunt after his\nmother abandoned him when he\nwas two weeks old. His aunt beat\nhim frequently and as a child he\nexhibited signs of paranoia and\nviolence. None of these facts were\ninvestigated during his trial.\nOnly in three states, Delaware,\nOklahoma and South Dakota, is age\nnot listed as a mitigating circumstance in the death penalty\nstatutes. In eighteen of the 24 states\nthat pass sentences of death on\njuveniles, age could be mentioned\nas a mitigating factor at the\nsentencing part of the trial. In many\ncases, as in the Prejean case,\nhowever, it is not.\nNo one, least of all Amnesty\nInternational, disputes the hideous\nnature of many of the crimes that\nare committed by juveniles. However, the death penalty must\nFrom left to right, Paula Cooper\nClayton Flowers (15) all sentenced\n(15), Kelly Pinkerton (17), Sean Sellers (16), Dalton Prejean (17),\nto death. Today only Sean Sellers is alive, his sentence is on appeal.\n\u2022 m MSL JU J L\\ JU \u2022 JU JU\\\nYOU' REBOUND, In August 1991 ST A Travel sponsored three Imperial\nCollege students in their attempt to traverse the High\nAtlas Mountains in Morocco. Drop into our office in the\nSherfield Building to examine the fascinating pictorial\nevidence of their expedition.\nImperial College Sherfield Building SWT\nAB TAl99209 STA TRAVEL\nsurely remain one of the most\ninappropriate methods of dealing\nwith such crimes. As it has been\nhighlighted, young offenders\nconvicted or murder usually\noriginate from deprived backgrounds, many have low\nintelligence (and are sometimes\nmentally retarded) with most\nshowing signs of psychiatric disorders. These factors make them\nless able to act rationally under\nstress and make them extremely\nsusceptible to influences from older\npeople. (In many cases juveniles\ncommitted the -crimes in the\npresence of older peers.) It is\ndifficult to see how the death\npenalty would deter such an\noffender. It has also been found that\njuvenile offenders are very responsive to education and\npsychiatric treatment whilst on\ndeath row. Many begin to learn to\nread and write and some even take\nup correspondence courses while\nthe long legal process of appeals is\ncarried out (many years can be\nspent waiting for execution).\nAmnesty International argues that\nwith the imposition of the death\npenalty there is no chance of\nreform, no chance for the offender\nto give something back to society.\nThis is especially true of young\noffenders. Before his execution\nDalton Prejean expressed remorse\nfor his crime and explained 'I 've\nchanged. There's a whole lot of\ndifference between being 17 and\n30'. With reference to his nine year\nold son he said, 7 think about\nCleveland's( the police officer)\nchildren, the fact they don't have a father either.' In his final statement\nhe again referred to the police\nofficer's family: 'To the Cleveland\nfamily, they say it wasn't for the\nrevenge but it's hard for me to see,\nto understand...I hope they're\nhappy.'\nDespite all the facts highlighted\nthe cruel nature of the death penalty\nand International Standards prohibiting the execution of youths\nunder 18 years of age, some 24\nstates and even the US Supreme\nCourt still insist that the execution\nof juveniles is permissible. (In 1989\nthe Supreme Court reinforced this\nview in a ruling that execution of\noffenders as young as 16 is\npermissible under the constitution).\nIC Amnesty Group( in\nconjunction with Amnesty International), are currently embarking on a campaign to bring\npressure on the US to stop the\nimposition of the death penalty for\njuvenile crime, and commute the\ndeath sentences of those now on\ndeath row. Anybody interested in\nhelping this campaign should come\nalong to the group meetings in the\nClubs Committee Room on Tuesday at 5.30pm, or spare a minute to sign a letter at our stall,\nin the J CR, on Tuesday lunchtime.\n2\n1 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix 914 25 October 1\n9\n9\n1\nWhy is the world in the state it is?\nWhy do some people starve, others\nwallow in plenty? Are things\ngradually improving? And are we\nin the West really helping to bring\nabout a change for the better in the\nlot of the poor nations?\nThere has always been a feeling\nin the West that the developing\nnations need our help. If only they\ncould learn from what we have to\nteach them they would not be so\ndesperately poor. This was exactly\nthe thinking which helped to justify\nthe European empire in Latin\nAmerica, Africa and Asia. Today,\nof course, this kind of moral\nvalidation of the European presence\nin these continents cannot stand up\nto any kind of scrutiny. It is quite\napparent that the relationship\nbetween Britain and India to exploit\nher resources and any gain on\nIndia's part was minimal and\nincidental. However, I would\nsuggest that this argument is not\nvery far from the one used today in\norder to justify Western actions, or\nrather interference, in developing\ncountries today.\nLet us start with the questions\n'What is aid?', 'What does aid\nreally involve?' If we look at the\ncontext in which financial help (be\nit loans or donations) is offered to\ndeveloping nations, it becomes clear\nthat the intentions of the West are\nnot entirely benevolent. One of the\nprime lenders of financial aid today\nis the World Bank. The World Bank\nwas set up by the USA and the\nmajor western powers after WorldWar Two, with the aim of rebuilding war-torn Europe and\nJapan, and after that to promote\nfinancial stability, economic growth\nand a cooperation with the member\nstates. Today there are 151\ncountries which are members of the\nWorld Bank\u2014most of the countries\nexcept Warsaw Pact signatories. A condition of membership is that\neach country must contribute a certain percentage of its Gross\nNational Product (GNP) for the\nBank's use.\nMuch criticism has been made by\nthe poorer members concerning the\nconditions which the World Bank\nsets before releasing loans to\ndeveloping countries. The undemocratic nature of the Bank\nmeans that developing nations are\nalmost powerless to implement\npolicies of their own choice: it is\nassumed that the West knows more\nabout the problems in Mexico, for\nexample, than the Mexicans themselves. There seems to have\nbeen no change in western attitudes\nsince colonial times. What determines the voting rights of\ncountries in the World Bank is the\nsize of their pocket. Thus the USA, Japan and all the industrialised\ncountries have the majority of the\nvoting power\u2014the USA exercises\n18.5 % of the votes, while China has\nonly 2 . 5 % despite the fact that its\npopulation is four times larger than\nthat of the USA. What all this means is that the\nWorld Bank in effect acts upon\npolicies laid out by the USA and\nother industrialised nations.\nThe poor nations have very little\nsay how the world economy should\nbe run. This has had a devastating\neffect upon them. Over the last\ndecade or so World Bank policies\nhave been deeply unpopular in\nmany countries. Unfortunately they\nare powerless to do anything\u2014they\nhave been denied a voice.\nIt is generally agreed that the\n1980s were an appalling decade for\nthe poor nations of the world. Many people also argue that the World Bank helped make things worse\nrather than alleviate the squalor of\nthe poor. The crisis was brought\nabout during the 1970s through the\nmassive borrowing by the\ngovernments of developing nations\nfrom banks in the West which were\noverflowing with oil dollars from\nOPEC countries. These commercial\nbanks (which of course include our\nfriendly high street chums in this\ncountry) were very 'liberal' with\ntheir lending policies. The interest\nrepayments were set at commercial\nrates, which seemed reasonable to\nboth parties at the time. This was\na period of economic buoyancy and\nit seemed that the developing\nnations might at long last break the\nvicious cycles of poverty. However\nthis mood of optimism was not to\nlast very long. During the late\nseventies, the West was set for a downward slide into recession. This\nbrought with it very high interest\nrates which meant that debt\nservicing replay ment s by the poor\nto the rich nations were massively\nincreased.\nHowever, high interest rates are\nnot the only problem. The fundamental problem the\ndeveloping countries face today is\nthat of inequality in the world\nmarkets imposed by the West. The\nsystem is rigged up in such a way\nthat the value of manufactured\ngoods far exceeds the value of raw\nmaterials (excepting oil of course).\nIn the 1980s there was a sharp drop\nin raw material prices which meant\nthat the West would have even\ncheaper access to them, whereas the\nThird World First\n\u201418\u2014\n\n"

Well last\nSaturday was The Great Sightseeing\nChallenge and let's not beat about\nthe bush, it certainly was Great.\nThere were over 80 people taking\npart and we raised \u00a31,400 for\nUNICEF, who in case you haven't heard help bundles of kiddies in\npoor counties; well worth a good\ndonation any day.\nSo UNICEF were happy and we\nwere happy. But what were we\nactually happy about? Well the\ngeneral idea was a Sightseeing Tour\naround London but with the slight\ncatch that you only got told where\nthe next sight was when you had\ncompleted a small, but definitely\namusing challenge. So we ended up\nwith teams piggy-backing around\nthe Cutty Sark, dancing on bus\nshelters outside BBCTV Centre\nand trying to obtain items of ladies'\nunderwear outside St Paul's Cathedral.\nAs only about 80 people took\npart, a lot of people have already\nasked me if I was disappointed with\nsuch a drop in numbers from the\n2 5 0 + that participated in\nMonopoly. On the contrary, I was\nmore than pleased with the turn out.\nThere had been aUL U all- night er the night before, it was the first day\nof the freeze- your-wot sits off\nweather and the Biology department\nwere off on a field-trip. Despite all\nthis, 80 people went out, had a really fun day in the cold and raised\na lot of money for a worthy charity\nin the process. That's what Rag's all about and I'm happy. My only\nregret is that more of you didn't take part in what proved to be a great day. Ah well, you'll know for\nnext time.\nThe winning team would have\nbeen that led by last year's top\ncollector Martin Heighway, but due\nto personally fiddling with the\npenalties awarded to his team, the\nteam were disqualified. Many members of the team did however\npick up prizes for the amount that\nthey raised on the day. There were,\nas a result, 3 winning teams : The Bloody Well Should Be In France;\nPhyllis (With Biological Action)\nand The Einsteins. They will all\nreceive prizes, including an A to Z Guide of London each, an\ninvaluable accessory for any\nLondon student, 15 of which A to\nZ kindly donated.\nIn the evening a load of Rags\nfrom other universities around the\ncountry descended on Imperial for\na party organised by UNICEF. The\nevening was a great social event and\nit was good to see most of our\ncollectors attending. Southampton\nhad the largest turnout of the day,\nwith about 150 students. This meant\nthat the female to male ratio was the\nlargest that I 've ever seen in the\nUnion Snack Bar. Southampton\nraised about \u00a31,800 during the day,\nwhich proves that on a total per\nhead we can still come out best.\nMany thanks go to all that helped\non the day, but special thanks must\ngo to Laurie, Beccy and Aled whose\njobs as marshals were made\nconsiderably harder than others by\nlack of company in the cold\nweather.\nThere were a great deal of ways\nthat the event could have been\nimproved, but for a first attempt I'm really pleased with its success. It's definitely something that we'll do\nagain.\nP.S. It was good to see two of the\nUnion Sabbaticals helping as\nmarshals and enjoying themselves\nin the process.\nSightseers on the run again.\nRaggies visit Buck House.\nThat's more or less all the big Rag\nevents over for now. There are,\nhowever, for those of you with a taste for what Rag's about, enough\nthings for you to take part in until\nRag Week arrives. (Read the article\nif you haven't already.)\nToday, presuming that you're\nreading this on Friday, you take\npart in our City of London Pub\nCrawl. Armed with a Rag Can( collecting box), the idea is for\nteams of up to 4 to locate 8 pubs\nwithin the City, collecting from rich\nfolk on the way. You can register\neither at today's Rag Meeting\n(Union Lounge, 12.40pm), at the\nUnion Office during the afternoon,\nor at the Rag Office from 5.30pm onwards. For those serious about\neither drinking, collecting or just\nhaving fun, it's a must.\nOn Sunday, we have a collecting\nlicence for Covent Garden Market.\nYou really must be in fancy dress,\nbut that hasn't been a problem for\nmany people at previous events. If\nyou're interested come to the Rag\nMeeting today or contact me on\nSaturday on Fisher Hall ext 406.\nAfter all this, there's Hallowe'en\n(college fun), Bonfire Night (a quick collection before the\nfireworks at Battersea) and the\nPoppy Day collection (Sat 9th Nov)\nfollowed in the evening by a Leukaemia Research Pub Crawl.\nSo, Be Mad, Be Silly & Be Part\nOf It! Cheers\nPENGUIN Rag Chair 91/92\nP.S. Don't forget, there's our Rag\nmeeting every Friday in the Union Lounge at 12.40pm. Everybody's welcome, so come along and find\nout how to get roped into helping\norganise and take part in all of what\nRag has to offer this year.\n\u201416\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "News Felix 914 25 October 1\n9\n9\n1\nA Day Too Long\nThe College day seems likely to be\nextended by an hour, after the\nsecond report of the working party\ndealing with the matter. The proposal is that teaching hours be\nextended from the present 9.30am to 5.30pm to a period running from\n9.00am to 6.00pm. The paper gives a run down of\nthe reaction to the proposals from\nthe departments and states that\nalthough 'student opinion was\nwholly opposed to the change', that\n' we know of no systematic\nexpression of students' views'. This\ndespite the various referendums\nconducted by the various student\nunions of Imperial College.\nThe cost of the change will play\nthe most important part in the\nCollege's decision about whether to\nmake the change to the length of the\nacademic working day, according\nto the report. It quotes that staff\ncosts in academic departments will\nbe around \u00a3 5 3 , 0 0 0 and an\nadditional cost of \u00a323,000 for the\nCollege Nursery. This appears to be\na minimum costing of the situation\nas it is not known whether staff cost\nfigures from the departments\nincluded super an nu ation contributions or not.\nIt is unknown whether the longer\nday will present a problem to the\nalready stretched College Estates\nDepartment. Although a letter from\nthe Managing Director, Gordon Marshall, promises that 'the extra\ncosts will be next to nothing',\ndetails are unclear. A full set of\nestimates have been prepared by the\ndepartment but the paper states that\n'it has not been possible for us to\nsee them.'.\nAs it is, the matter has been\nundecided until the next Board of\nStudies meeting on the 11th December. Whichever way the\nBoard decides, it seems that Student\nopinion is not going have a large\neffect on the outcome.\nRag Total\nRag's Great Sightseeing Challenge\non Saturday raised \u00a31,424.79 for\nthe United Nations Childrens Fund,\nUNICEF. This brings the Rag total\nto \u00a312,700.\nLate LEA's Many students around the country\nhave not yet received their\nmaintenance grants from their Local\nEducation Authorities ( LEA). The LEAs claim this is because of a government directive that tuition\nfees are to be paid first, while the\ngovernment claims this delay is due\nto LEA inefficiency.\nNew Glider for ICU\nOf the total cost, the Union only\ncontributed \u00a311,000, with a further\n\u00a317,000 from the Harlington Trust,\nwhich was set up with profits from\ngravel extraction at the former\nHarlington Sports Grounds. The remaining \u00a317,000 was raised by\nthe club itself by the sale of its Club\nLibelle glider and shares in a Lasham trainer, as part of their five-year plan.\nThe Grob 103 is available for\ntraining to club members, and for\ntrial flights to anyone who is\ninterested. Trial flights cost \u00a321 for\nthe day. See the What's On page for\ndetails.\nSuper-Solar-Cell\nImperial College Union Gliding\nClub have recently acquired a high\nperformance dual seat glider. The glass-fibre glider cost \u00a345,000 and\nis IC's only dual glider. Previously,\nthe club had to hire dual gliders\nfrom the flying site at Lasham.\nThe Gro b103C arrived from\nGermany on 8th Oct and first flew\nlast weekend. It is the first of its\ntype in this country. Its arrival was\nvery timely as Lasham's own G103\nwas written off in a heavy landing\nthat week. The ICU Gliding Club decided to buy the aircraft two years\nago when Lasham decided not to\nconvert to glass-fibre gliders,\nleaving IC with two solo glass-fibre\ngliders but no dual trainer. The glider was eventually ordered in\nJanuary when the Union funds were\nmade available.\nSolar cells could become conventional power sources like\ncoal and oil, it has been reported\nthis week.\nTwo reports, one from Imperial\nCollege, have forced scientists to\nrethink their attitudes to an energy\nsource once thought to be confined\nto cheap calculators.\nDoctor Keith Barnham of Imperial College Physics Department announced his results\nin the SER C( Science and\nEngineering Research Council)\nBulletin. His method involves an\nimprovement on conventional solar\ncells. In the improved cells thin\nlayers of semi-conductor material\nonly 50 atoms thick are added to\nform 'quantum wells' which trap\nhigher energy electrons than the\nnormal cell. The process is so\neffective that a cell containing fifty\nquantum wells is twice as efficient\nas one with thirty. Doctor Barnham\nsaid that the new cells could be\nproduced 'at little extra cost' than\nnormal cells\nDoctor Bryan O 'Reagan and\nDoctor Michael Gratzel of the\nSwiss Federal Institute of Technology published their results\nin Nature. They claim to be able to\nimprove the efficiency of Solar cells\non cloudy days. This is caused by\nthe surface of the sun absorbing the\nlarger range of light frequencies\nproduced during an overcast day.\nTheft\nA number of thefts have occured at\nIC this week. A mountain bike\nbelonging to Reggie Blennerhassett,\nex ICU finance officer, was taken\nfrom Prince's Gardens. Another\nmountain bike was stolen from the\nHuxley building on Queensgate.\nA student's car was broken into\nand seriously damaged in an attempt\nto steal the radio.\nA student found the lock on his\nlocker had been changed. He called\nsecurity who removed the lock,\nfinding the contents, including a suit, had been removed.\nAdditionally, a Psion Organiser\nand instruction booklet were\npilfered from the Aeronautics\nDepartment. Both items were left in\nan unoccupied office.\nThe Civil Engineering computer\nroom was broken into for the\nsecond time this term. Another\nNaga processor worth over \u00a31500\nhas been taken. The wires had been\nsevered in order to remove it.\nTerry Briley, security officer,\nsaid 'people should contact security\nif they want advice on securing\nvaluable items', as well as reiterating his warning that things\nshould not be left out so they can\nbe stolen.\nVirtuality\nThe Science Museum will be\nholding a lecture by Howard Rheingold on 'virtual reality' at\n2.30pm, today Friday 25th. Entry\nto the Science Museum is free on\nproduction of an IC Union Card.\n\u201424\u2014\n\n"

One\nis not even at I.C. anymore, and the\nother would've gone anyway,\nregardless of what I said about\nthem. Oh, I forgot. There was a bar\nextension on that night, wasn't there? And you came here to\nsupport the Ents team, didn't you?\nSure. Well, we managed both. We have our loyalties too.\nSo, I suppose you're interested in\nwhat happened, then. You want me\nto tell you how great Tomorrow's Tears was. Well, it wasn't. It was\nthe most sparse, beautiful, necessary piece of music I 've ever\nheard live. As far as icons go,\nhowever, it isn't long before\nAdoration accedes it. The nature of\nthis music is such that one almost\nbecomes subservient to it, becomes\npart of it, and the desire to give\nmyself over to it completely is\nfrightening. Cranes are an\ninstrumental band. They don't play\n'songs'. Alison's voice, whatever\nyou think of it, is not extraneous to\nthe music; the only correct appraisal\nis that it is Cranes' sound. It is\ncomplete. As a visual spectacle,\nCranes are stunning. Alison is quite\nOh dear. This is going to sound like\na diatribe, a pathetic little tirade\nwhich will do nothing but enhance\nmy reputation for being a sullen\nbastard. I hope those intention ed are\nreading this. Y' see, it has come to\nmy attention that certain people\nseem to think I have an obsession\nwith Cranes. Like I'm obsessed by\nFrancis Bacon, Shelley, Wilde,\nSisters of Mercy, Gauloises, young\nAmerican girls, Kate Bush - shut up\nand calm down, David. You' re ranting now. My ego, too.\nEven allowing for hypocrisy\nhere, I have nothing for them but\na well-aimed ' Fuck You'. Life is\nabout being obsessed by things - by\nbeauty, religion, politics, art, ac liche like love. I don't mean to get\ndidactic, my own cynicism gives\nme little room in this case, but what\nI admire about people with loves\nand hobbies is they get enthusiastic\nabout what they do, whether it's looking at trains, carving wood\nornaments, even being tied to a fucking bed and beaten senseless.\nThere's a line from one of the Tin\nstill, like her stillness is the only\nthing keeping the world together as\nthe world, has another go at\nfragmenting. She cuts an\nimpressively vulnerable figure\ncentre stage while behind her, reels\nexplore a ghost-child's nursery. Not\na gig. Not asean ce or a mass.\nSomething other. There is some\nmaniacal movement onstage from\nthe other band members, but there's none of that awful lighters-in-the-air unity here. You' re alone in a crowded room with a single\nreligious experience all to yourself,\nand you're telling yourself that this\nis the way it should be; you're\nalienated and anti-social, but you're\nalso right. Only you could feel like\nthis.\nAnyway, both before and after,\nthe audience were funny. Hilarious.\n'Cranes are not a goth band'. I 've\nlost count of how many people have\nsaid this, myself included. Strangely enough, though, barring\nthe hacks, the entire audience is\ncomprised of the original skeleton\ncrew, all taken the day off so they\ncould do their make-up and hair.\nWhat fun we had, a laugh in' and a point in'. It ain't undead anymore,\nit's very dead. Woe is me. Shall I, too, dye? Oh, Ha Ha.D' you think\nI'm taking coverage of Cranes to\nextremes? Think again; Cranes are\nextreme. And you? Well, you\nshould start doing something with\nyour life. Or just fucking get one.\nDavid. Machine songs that goes ' You can't see me drowning, I don't see you\nswimming'. Comprendez?\nWhat en amours life to me are the\ncountless spices ingenious human\nbeings throughout history have\nloaded it with. Socrates, Donne,\nMarlowe, even Kesey- the list is\nendless. Why make a point of eating\nit raw? It tastes fucking awful. For too many of you, alcohol is your\nonly refuge; alcohol is not a refuge.\nIf anything, it makes the whole\nsorry mess even worse. Does the\nscope of your vision amount to\nnothing more than the tenth\nobservation of the bottom of your\npint glass, sorry, tankard? Are you\ngoing to vindicate this bullshit? I'd like to hear from you. No.I'd love\nto. If I don't,At least I can be\nassured that you're the sad, pathetic\ncunts I thought you were.\nDavid Spooner\nP.S.I shall murder one student\nevery hour, on the hour, until my\nCramps ticket is returned to my\ndesk. That goes for You too,\nflower. You know who You are.\nSpitfire/Herb\n-IC Union\nI 've been told that I'm not very nice\nabout many bands that play in this\nplace. It's true. I do give them as lagging, but then again that's just\nan opinion. It's like filling up the\nphotocopier really.\nHerb are the best new band I 've\nseen for six months, but even if they\nweren't, why were less than 100\ntickets sold to over 6000 students.\nTell me, please, are you just\napathetic boring bastards, or what?\nAs for Spitfire, they were\nbearable, but they couldn't touch\nHerb for sheer class, but for three\nquid you can't go wrong anyway.\nGo on, live. Drop your wok and go\nfor it. Yes, of course we do, it's not\nall work, work, work.\nLise Yates\n25th of May\nWhat's Going On\nI like this. Thought I'd better make\nit clear as I always get asked why\nI slag everything off, even though\nI don't. It's dance y in an indie\nsense, but faster than most.\nThe lyrics are supposedly 'right\non' and I guess they are pretty\ncatchy, delivered in a sort of white\nrap style that, nonetheless, maintains its funk. This tendency\ntowards dance motifs does not carry\nmuch favour with me - yes, I don't really like indie records, but I guess\nwhat swayed me in this case was a hazy, hash-filled sunny Sunday\nafternoon when I saw them live.\nThey were sound (please excuse\ndod gy puns). My only gripe is that\nthey were too smooth on the 12\".\nLive they had a bit of an edge, the\nsound was rougher, the samples not\nso clean. Not much of a gripe,\nreally.\nSo anyway, next time you cruise\nthrough the record shop on the lookout for some indie shite, pause, and\nbuy 25th of May instead. It's unlikely that you'll be disappointed.\nSeb\nNorth Point Park\nMiddlesex Poly\nTo describe North Point Park as\nrope y is akin to describing Weeks\nHall as slightly structurally unsound. They' re terrible. Truly\ntotally terrible. Truly terminally\ntotally terrible. Still, this might just\nbe an opinion of mine, and some\npeople were actually dancing to it.\nHell, if you don't believe me go and\nsee them. Just don't invite me.\nLise Yates\nCe-Ce Peniston\n-Finally\nExtreme\n-Decadence\nDance\nto receive. The first, Ce Ce\nPeniston, conjures up great images\nof huge, phallic, thrusting beats. No go, it's shite. Soul/dance crossover\nbullshit that will probably go down\nwell with the Top of the Pops hand-clap crew. A real chart topper.\nDom says it's great; ' A real garage\nclassic'.\nThe other is extreme. The band,\nmost definitely not the adjective.\nExtreme are crap. Glam Rock\nclich e, wild, thrusting, phallic\nguitar solos. It does sound good at\n33 r.p.m., sort of Prong-ish, a real\ncock rock hero's record. Are they\ngay? it certainly sounds like it. This\nsort of band deserve all the chart\nsuccess they can get, 'cause they've\nmanaged to perfect the over-produced, over-promoted sound\nthat most guitar worshippers want\nthese days.\nIf anyone can think of any reason\nwhy anyone could actually like\neither of these records send me the\nanswer on a postcard to Felix, and\nyou can have either, or even both\nof the singles.\nZan ie Spoonhead's Ego Trip\n\u2014 6 \u2014\n\n"

Sentenced ten months\nlater, Prejean remained on death\nrow for twelve years before being\nput to death by electrocution.\nHowever, the real tragedy of this\ncase is that at the time of the offence\nPrejean was just 17 years of age.\nThe USA is one of just seven\ncountries to have executed juvenile\noffenders over the last decade.\nSince the 1970s when the death\npenalty was reinstated in 36 states,\n90 juveniles have been sentenced to\ndeath. All were between 15 and 17\nyears old at the time of the offence.\nAlthough many of these sentences\nwere co muted to life imprisonment\non appeal, four were executed\nbetween 1985 and 1990 and as of July 1991, 31 remain under\nsentence of death in 12 states. With\nthe possible exception of Iraq and\nIran, the USA has executed more\njuveniles in recent years, and hold\na higher number on death row, than\nany other country known to\nAmnesty International.\nIn carrying out these executions,\nthe USA has violated International\nStandards which, although not\nprohibiting the death penalty in all\ncircumstances, unanimously prohibit the imposition of this cruel\nand degrading punishment to\npersons aged 18 or under at the time\nof the offence. Such standards\ninclude treaties of the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political\nRights ( I CCPR), the American\nConvention on Human Rights\n( A CHR) and the United Nations\n( UN) convention on the right of the\nchild. The USA is signatory to all\nthese treaties, although it has only\nratified the latter. In 1984 the UNEconomic and Social Council adopted safeguards guaranteeing the\nrights of prisoners under sentence\nof death, also providing an age limit\nof 18 for such a sentence.\nAmnesty International opposes\nthe death penalty unconditionally in\nall cases believing it to be a violation of the right to life, as\nstated in the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights. Although Amnesty does accept that juvenile\noffenders should be held criminally\nliable for their actions, it argues that\nthe death penalty, with its cruel and\nirreversible nature, is an especially\ninappropriate punishment in these\ncases. It is widely accepted that\nJames Roach (17), executed, and Troy Dugar (15), on death row.\nchildren and adolescents are less\nresponsible for their actions and\nmuch more susceptible to\nrehabilitation than adults. These\narguments are further credited by\nthe melancholy words of Charles\nRambaugh, executed in Texas in\n1985 for the murder of a jewellery\nstore owner. He wrote to a pen friend18 months before his\ndeath at the age of 26, '...Istarted\nmaking mistakes at a very young\nage and never changed before it was\ntoo late. 1 was 17 years old when\nI committed the offence for which\nI was sentenced to die, and I didn't even start thinking and caring about\nmy life until I was at least 20.'\nIn addition to humanitarian\nconcerns over juvenile executions,\nthere are also some disturbing\nfactors that seem to recur many\ntimes, in trials of juveniles that lead\nto the imposition of the death\npenalty. Racial disparities are\nevident in the numbers of young\noffenders sentenced to death. Since\n1900 the USA executed over 190\njuveniles of which 7 5 % were black\nyouths. Under present statues, the\ndisparities based on the race of the\noffender have fallen, although 4 9 %\nof the 31 offenders currently on\ndeath row are black, with 7 5 % of\nthe 31 convicted or murdering white\nvictims. In many cases, as in the\ncase of Dalton Prejean, trials of\nblack offenders have been moved to\n\u2022 predominantly white areas. In the\nPrejean case, the prosecutor then\nused his peremptory challenges (the\nright to reject potential jurors\nwithout explanation) and excluded\nall four black jurors from the panel.\nThis right was also exercised in the\nTable 1: States with Numbers of Juvenile Offenders on Death Row and\nMinimum Age for the Imposition of the death penalty.\nState No.on DR Minimum Age Alabama 6 14\nFlorida 3 No limit\nGeorgia 2 17\nKentucky 1 16\nLouisiana 1 15\nMissouri 2 16\nNorth Carolina 2 17\nOklahoma 2 No limit\nPennsylvania 3 No limit\nTexas 7 17\nWashington 1 No limit\ncase of another black youth Robert\nCarter (still under appeal), where\nthe prosecutor used peremptory\nchallenges to remove 12 potential\njurors who had slight reservations\nabout the death penalty despite them\nexpressing their confidence in their\nown ability to impose the death\npenalty if they felt it appropriate.\nProbably the most alarming\nfeature of many of these trials,\nhowever, is the incompetence of the\ndefence council in producing vital\nevidence which would have shown\nthe mitigating circumstances of the\ncrime. During 1986 and 1987 a team of psychiatrists studied 14\njuveniles under sentence of death(l). Extensive psychiatric and\nneurological examinations were\nFootnote1: The study was\nconducted by D.O. Lewis M.D., New York University School of\nMedicine, and Dr J. H. Pincus,\nGeorgetown University Centre.\nmade and evidence of psychiatric\nillness or brain damage was found\nin nearly every case. All14 had\nsuffered head injuries as children,\nwhich in eight cases resulted in\nhospital is ation. Seven of the\ninmates suffered from psychiatric\ndisturbances from an early age with\nfour others showing histories of\nsevere mood disorders. Only two\nhad an IQ over 90 (100 being the\nnormal score). Twelve had suffered\nphysical abuse as children and five\nhad been sodom is ed by older male\nrelatives. Of the parents of the\ninmates most had histories of alcoholism, drug abuse and psychiatric treatment. Few of these\npotential mitigating factors were\never brought to light by the defence\ncouncil during the inmates' trials.\nDalton Prejean was found to have\nan IQ of only 77. Tests performed\nin 1984 indicated that he suffered\nfrom organic brain damage which\nimp a red the control of his impulses\n\u201420\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "25 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 914 Reviews\nMortal Thoughts\nAlan Rudolph, cult director of films\nsuch as Choose Me, The Moderns\nand more recently Love at Large,\nnow gives us his twelfth feature\u2014\nMortal Thoughts.\nIn the movie, Cynthia (Demi\nMoore) and Joyce (Glenne Headly),\nplay childhood friends who run a beauty salon together, while raising\nchildren and coping with their\nhusbands.\nHeadly's husband James, played\nby Bruce Willis, is so abusive,\naggressive and loud, that most\npeople who meet him wish he\nwould drop dead. James subjects his\nwife to a torrent of physical and\nverbal abuse, and seems only\ninterested in getting stoned or\ndrunk. So when early on in the\nmovie, James is murdered and his\nbody dumped in a ditch, family and\nfriends feel everything from relief\nto sorrow to guilt.\nThe story is told in a series of flashbacks, as Moore recounts the\nevents leading up to James's murder\nduring an interview she is giving\nvoluntarily to the police.\nAs the murder investigation\ncloses in, the strain begins to take\nits toll on the two women's relationship, and friendship and\nmorality begin to clash with the\ninstinct for survival.\nAs a thriller which revolves\naround the murder of Willis's character, the move does not work\nvery well, with the 'twist' in the plot\nbecoming quite obvious about ten\nminutes before it is revealed.\nAlan Rudolph's strength as a director has always been the way in\nwhich he handles the relationship\nbetween his characters, and Mortal\nThoughts is a good example of this.\nRudolph's direction is at times\nheavy handed, and his frequent use\nof slow motion ends up being\ntedious, but what he does manage\nto do is allow the interplay of his\ncharacters to make up for the lack\nof narrative strength in the move.\nMortal Thoughts is quite a downbeat movie, which relies\nheavily on the performances of its\nprinciple players. Bruce Willis is\nquite convincing as Joyce' s complete animal of a husband\n(although at times the famous Willis\ncheeky grin gets a little tiring) and\nunlike her recent lightweight roles\nin movies such as Dick Tracy,\nHeadly here demonstrates her\nconsiderable talent as James's long\nsuffering wife.\nHowever this is really Demi Moore's show, as it is her\nperformance that holds the movie\ntogether. Despite looking like she's just stepped off the cover of Vogue,\nMoore is surprisingly convincing as\nthe middle class hardworking wo a mn, and her performance lends\nthe movie some considerable\ndramatic weight.\nHarvey Kietel, as the police\ndetective also lends fine support,\ndespite the fact that he is essentially\nreprising the character and the suit\nhe had in Theima and Louise.\nMortal Thoughts has its flaws,\nand as a murder mystery it is a bit\nof a non-starter, but thanks to some\nvery good acting, it is nonetheless\nan interesting and watch able character study.\nThe Don.\nRambling Rose Invisible\nRambling Rose, starring Laura\nDern, Diane Ladd and Robert\nDuvall was written eighteen years\nago. To say that it has taken this\nlong to make it to the big screen\nmust surely arouse a question as to\nwhy? Why not just leave it to gather\ndust instead of resurrecting an\nalready lame story and subjecting\npoor cinema-goers to almost two\nhours of boredom, ancient clich es and unmemorable characters. It\nmust surely be someone's idea of\na joke. According to the producer,\nRenny Harling, fresh from directing\nDie Hard II\u2014-Die Harder, he read\nRambling Rose in the hope that it\nwould help him fall asleep\u2014I'm surprised it didn't have that effect,\nalthough like him, the story left me\ncrying too.\nRose ( Dern), from a poor background, joins the family of Duvall and Ladd as a maid in a small Georgia town in 1935, after\nbeing forced into prostitution at an\nearly age. Promiscuity, still being\nher main interest, she continues to\nlay every man in sight, or try to,\nsaying sweetly ' Women don't want\nsex \u2014 they just want love'. Eventually she finds it, and marries\nfour times, before her not too\nuntimely death at the end of the\nfilm.\nThe film has been described as a 'tonic, piquant, absorbing and\nuplifting'\u2014it's true, I did have a warm sensation in my stomach, but\nthat was just the bile rising up inside\nof me. This is just one film that\nshould have been left on the cutting\nroom floor\u2014the actors gave it their\nbest, but sadly (?) the script let them\ndown. What more can I say? Given\na choice between seeing Rambling\nRose and doing a week's washing\nup at London's busiest restaurant,\nI know which I'd choose...now\nwhere did I put the Fairy...? Bill & Ben.\nThis., well, this video fails to fall\nwithin the blinkered confines of the\nword 'good' and 'bad' and invents\na strange, vague classification all of\nits own. In fact, this would be a great opportunity to say 'transcends\ngenre' except that I don't think it\nwould be very appropriate. OK, if\nyou want a pigeonhole, let's try\nexploitation movie par excel lance. We start with the eminently\nplausible premise that a psychopathic biophysicist takes up\na teaching post in a remedial high\nschool. Said gentleman has\ndeveloped a serum which turns him\ninto a you guessed it - invisible\nmaniac. Natch, he has a hang up of\nthe nether regions which leads to the\nusual proliferation of garment less women and a bit of violence; most\nof this is fairly pedestrian stuff, but\nhey ! that's life, huh?\nAnyway, there's not really a good\nreason to watch this vid, but there's a fair few bad ones, mostly to do\nManiac\nwith hormones. It's ethically\nunsound and features a man choking\nto death on a French loaf sandwich,\nbut don't let that put you off. I never\nliked French loaves much anyway.\nThis is one of those bizarre films\nthat was made to laugh at, even\nthough it's completely straight all\nthe way through. Probably best\nappreciated with taste circuits on\nlow.\nNext week, in this place, we\nmove from sex ' n' violence to\nviolence ' n' sex with Street\nAsylum! The Flying Gerbil\nNB: The photograph to the right\nof this review is not in any way\nassociated with this film.\n\n"

If a test produces a positive result, i.e. HIV Positive.\nHowever, a negative result does not\nnecessarily mean that a person has\nnot got the virus. Antibodies take,\non average two to three months to\ndevelop, so if you think you may\nhave contracted Aids over the last\nfew months it may be too early for\nthem to show up on the test.\nThe decision about whether or\nnot you have the Aids Test needs\ncareful thought. Just having the test,\nwhatever the result, can affect your\nchance of getting life assurance. If\nyou feel that you would like to have\na test, for peace of mind, you can\ndiscuss it with the representative\nfrom the Health Centre.\nThe Smear Test\nCervial Cancer kills 2,000 women\nevery year in the UK, with the vast\nmajority never having had acer vial smear test. The disease is however,\nnearly always preventable, which is\nwhy it is so important that any\nwoman who has ever had sexual\nintercourse should have a cervical\nsmear test.\nThe earlier you start having\nsexual intercourse, the greater the\nrisk of developing cervical cancer.\nUsing a barrier method of contraception, like a condom or\ndiaphragm, every time you have sex\nwill help to protect the cervix from\npossible infection by viruses, and\nmay thus reduce the risk.\nCancer of the cervix can be\nprevented if changes in the cells\nwhich precede it are treated. A cervical smear test will determine\nwhether the cells are normal or not\nand if the smear is 'abnormal'\nfurther investigation will take place.\nIt is very important that women\nhave regular smear tests every three\nto five years\u2014so if you would like\nto find out more about having a cervical smear test the\nrepresentative from the Health\nCentre will be able to advise.\nThe service that we provide every\nnight of term from 6pm to 8am is\ntwofold: firstly we will listen in a non-judgemental and non-directive\nmanner providing you with a chance to sort out how you feel or\nwhat you want to do when faced\nwith a difficult situation; secondly,\nand of equal importance, is our\ninformation service on anything\nfrom What'sOn in London or train\ntimes to contraception issues or late\nnight chemists.\nCall us any night of term on\n071-436 5561 or, if you want to\nhelp, the see us at the fair.\n3. Alcohol\nWhat's wrong with having a drink\nnow and then?\nProbably nothing, if that's what\nit is\u2014having a drink now and then.\nThere are many reasons why we\ndrink. Most people say the drink to\nenjoy themselves and to help them\nrelax with family or friends. Others\nsay they drink because there's nothing better to do, or they're\ndepressed. It could be anything.\nDrinking is all about being\nsociable, but it depends on how\nmuch and why you drink. If you\ndon't go over the limit then you can\nprobably be more lively and\nfriendly. But it's obvious, usually\nat a pub or party, who's had too\nmuch to drink because they really\naren't worth talking to! They either\nmake total idiots of themselves or\nend up in a fight.\nIf you want to enjoy drinking you\nneed to be aware of when you've\nhad enough? Counting your alcohol\n'units' is a good way to watch your\ndrinking habits. Find out more\nabout alcohol and the limits at the\nHealth Fair. There is also a computer analysis game on alcohol\nwhich, with your unit control score,\nwill tell you what affect your\ndrinking is having on your body and\nyour pocket.\n4.

People find their own\nways to give up, but many ex-smokers, both heavy and light\nsmokers have found this general\nadvice helpful.\n1. Prepare yourself. Think about\nwhen and where you usually have\na cigarette. Once you've stopped\nsmoking, these times and places are\ngoing to be the danger spots, so\nwork out how you are going to deal\nwith them.\n2. Pick a day. Set a target day for\ngiving up. Make it a day when you\nwill not be under much stress.\n3. Stop. Give up and don't smoke\nany cigarettes. Take one day at a time. Every day without a cigarette\nis a success.\nNine out of ten ex-smokers gave up\nentirely on their own. But if you've\ntried before and found it very\ndifficult you might find one of these\naids helpful: nicotine chewing gum\n(available on prescription only)\nother chewing gums and tables,\nacupuncture or hypnosis, you could\nalso come along to the Giving Up Smoking Seminar on Friday.\n7.

Sleeping difficulties\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\nNightmares\nDepression\nMuscular symptoms\nCardiovascular symptoms\nRespiratory symptoms\nIncreased smoking or drinking\nAll of these are stress-related\nproblems and you may be suffering\nfrom stress without realising. The\nHealth Fair has a stall completely\ndevoted to stress, come along and\ntalk to an expert or to one of the\nstress relaxation sessions that have\nbeen organised.\n8. Welfare Office\nAt some stage of your time at\nImperial College you may need\nadvice or information and not know\nwhere to turn. The answer could\nwell be waiting at the Welfare\nAdvisory Service. Situated in the\nUnion Office in Beit Quad, Stefano\nRuis, the Union Welfare Adviser is\navailable to answer your questions,\nsee page eleven for opening times.\nMost of us are in debt. We may\nhave a credit card, astore card, an\noverdraft or may get credit from the\nfuel companies and BT by paying\nbills on a quarterly basis. A recent\nsurvey found that only 15% of\nadults knew what an Annual Percentage Rate ( APR) was,\nsuggesting that many take out credit\nwith no understanding of what it\nmay cost them.\nDebt is nothing new to students.\nFigures compiled by the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) show it\nwas almost impossible for students\nwith no extra income beyond a full\ngrant and full student loan to stay\nEmployment. This phenomenon is\nby no means limited to overseas\nstudents\u2014a survey compiled last\nautumn found that more than a tenth\nof university undergraduates have\nto combine study with employment\nduring term time in order to finance\ntheir way through higher education.\nIt is impossible to predict\naccurately how much a student will\nneed to live on each week or each\nmonth. Given the variety of lifestyles, course requirements,\nhousing costs, travel expenses and\nof course the amount of money\navailable, to suggest a figure would\nbe meaningless. To make the most\nMoney Matters\nin credit last year. Soaring rent\nlevels in London push the resources\nof the capital's students to their\nlimits. Coupled with the high cost\nof living, many find it difficult to\nmake ends meet and so get into debt\nsooner rather than later.\nIf you are a home student,\nstudying for your first degree, then\nyou are likely to be getting either\na mandatory award, a discretionary\naward or an allowance from the\nTraining Commission. Grants have been frozen this\nyear, following the introduction of\nstudent loans which are designed to\nsupplement the basic grant. From now on, the basic student\nmaintenance grant will remain at\n1990/91 levels; the loan element,\nmeanwhile, will increase each year\nuntil it forms 5 0 % of the grant\nincome. If you are a home student,\non a full-time undergraduate course\nand aged less than 50 when the\ncourse began a loan is automatically\non offer. The most you can borrow\nthis year is \u00a3660 (\u00a3460 if you live\nat home; final year students cannot\nborrow as much though) and\napplications are limited to one per\nyear per student. More information\ncan be found in the leaflet 'Student\nGrants and Loans' available form\nICU's Welfare Office.\nFinancial problems are not solely\nrestricted to home undergraduate\nstudents. With the withdrawal of\nbenefits from most full time students it is likely that\npostgraduates will also feel the\npinch. Overseas students,\nmeanwhile may have very limited\nfunding or be self-financing. The high prices to be found in London have meant that many must seek to\nsupplement their limited income,\noften by seeking part-time work\nhaving obtained prior permission\nfrom the Department of of what you have got though, you\nmay want to do your own budgeting\ncalculations. In this way you can\nestimate your expenditure over the\nyear, though you should bear in\nmind that monthly (or weekly)\noutgoing s will not necessarily be\nuniform. By setting aside a small\namount of time each week to work\nout your finances you may find you\navoid problems later on in the term.\nThis is by no means ideal for\neveryone though and care should be\ntaken to find a system that suits you.\nIf you need to go into debt though,\nhowever large or small the amount,\nit is a good idea to speak with your\nbank manager before he or she asks\nto see you.\nFor those that do get into\nfinancial difficulty, it is worth\nbearing in mind that by taking\nadvice early you may then avoid\nmore complicated problems later\non. If you do experience financial\nproblems and this is having an\naffect on your studies you should\nalways keep your personal tutor\ninformed. This way any extenuating\ncircumstances can be taken into\naccount when your work is\nassessed. If you need advice contact\nthe Union Welfare Office for help.\nWhatever you do, don't try to cope\nalone with what can be a very\nupsetting and de moral ising experience.\nRemember that debt is rarely\ncaused by irresponsible behaviour.\nThe biggest single factor leading to\nfinancial difficulty is a sudden\nreduction in income and the\nconsequent difficulties in meeting\ncommitments. Alternatively, an\nunexpected increase in your essential needs may require additional expenditure. Help yourself by seeking advice as early\nas you can.\n\u201412\u2014 13\u2014\n\n"

Huxley Society, Michael Newman,\non Thursday at 12.45 in Huxley\n(!!!) 340. We are a Humanist\nsociety - so why are we called the\nHuxley Society? And why this title\nfor the talk? Moreover, what is\nHumanism?\nHumanism is an attitude to life\nthat is based on atheism or\nagnosticism (Huxley coined this\nword), but which goes further than\nthis negative statement of non-belief. Humanists believe that life\nis all that we can be sure about and\nthat therefore we should strive to\nmake our lives and those of others\nas good as possible. The Humanist\nphilosophy started in ancient Greece\nwith Protagoras and has developed\nsince, greatly aided by the advent\nof rationalism and science... and\nnow there is an International!\nHumanist Movement.\nThe Humanist movement campaigns for, amongst other\nthings: Human Rights, freedom of\nspeech, secular ising state\ninstitutions and laws (eg Sunday\nTrading), equality, abortion, voluntary euthanasia. However, the\nmovement is not well known or\nrepresented and consequently the\nreligious lobby has a much greater\ninfluence on society.\nHuxley was a great figure in the\nhistory of IC. he was also a great\nscientist (and was Darwin' s\" Bulldog\") and \" liberal'' educator. He was also a great\nHumanist, and it was for these\nreasons that Huxley is the\n\" symbol\" of the IC humanist\nSociety. He, and others in the IC\nHumanist tradition, would be\nsurprised to find that in this science\ncollege there are so many people in\nthe various religious groups -especially the Christian Union! There must be more Humanists\n\"out there\"... if so, our society will\nrepresent your views.\nSo, are you a Humanist? Do you\nknow enough about Humanism to\ndecide? Do you know what the\nHuxley Society is really all about?\nCome along to the meeting and find\nout, and hear a talk about the\nHumanist (and especially IC)\ntradition and its future, and then\nwe'll adjourn to the Union bar!\nArachnophobia\nhas been seriously underestimated.\nI urge the reader (who may suffer\nfrom a similar affliction) to consider\nthe following points:\nPrimarily, why do the damn\nthings always turn up at the least\nexpected moment. Recently, I moved a small pile of house bricks by hand, fully expecting a black\nhairy thing to leap out at me at any\nmoment. However, no such creature emerged (unless next\ndoor's cat is classed as such).

    "content": "Casualty Super Plug\nA first year chemistry student,\nStephen Dorm an, was seriously\ninjured last Thursday during a mascot kidnap attempt. He underwent two operations in\nhospital after having his leg run\nover by a car driven by another\nstudent involved in the mascot ry attempt.\nThe accident happened at\napproximately 9.45pm after the\nRoyal College of Science Union( R CSU) fresher's dinner. Members\nof the City and Guilds Union managed to capture the R CSU mascot 'Theta' and were about to\nmake off from, behind the Union Building in a car when a group of\nR CSU students attempted to stop it\nby laying on the car's roof and\nbonnet.\nThe driver of the car told Felix\nthat he 'expected them not really to\nget on' and that he was surprised by\nthem 'jumping on the car and\ncovering the bonnet and roof. He said that he could not see clearly for\nthe bodies on the windscreen and\nshouted for them to get off while\ndriving forward slowly. He said that\nhe stopped instantly when he felt a bump from under one of the wheels.\nA first a ider and the St John's Ambulance crew from the Albert\nHall tended Mr Dorm an until the\nambulance came.\nHe explained that the Mr Dorman\nhad one side of his lower leg run\nover, suffering a compound fracture\nwhich required two operations in\nhospital.\nThe driver told Felix that the\nPolice have reported him for\n'reckless driving' and 'driving\nwithout due care' and that he\nexpects to be 'charged sometime in\nthe future'. He said that Mr Dorm an asked the police not to\ncharge and that he was 'very\namenable'. He added that, in his\nview, 'people were taking mascot ry far too seriously.'\nA meeting called to discuss\nmascot ry has been convened for 5th November. It is expected that the\nuse of motorised vehicles will be\nprohibited for mascot ry events. All mascot ry activities have been\nsuspended until the meeting.\nLoan Applications Up\nStudent Loan applications are up\nthis year, and the waiting list is\ngetting longer. Loan interviews are\nbooked up until 25th November, a date constantly being moved back\nas more students' make appointments. Last year, students\nnationwide borrowed an average of\n\u00a3388 under the loan system. This\nyear about 30,000 students have\napplied for a loan of \u00a3570 or more\ndue largely to the freezing of grants\nand the late arrival of L.E.A. grant\ncheques.\nA London student can, this year,\nborrow up to \u00a3660 with interest at\nthe rate of inflation - 5.8% for\n1991. A new student on a three year\ncourse taking a full London loan\nwill, upon graduation, have a debt\nof \u00a3923 from his first year,\nassuming a constant inflation rate.\nA 'sympathetic attitude' is said to\nbe taken to students who have either\nfinished their degree or dropped out\nand are unable to repay their loans.\nTony Cullen, Assistant Registrar\nat Imperial College, said that this\nyear 'student loans are a fact of life'\nwhereas 'last year they were more\nof an option'. One hundred and five\nstudents at I.C. have already taken\nup a loan this year and an estimated\n35 a week are registering. At this\nrate about one thousand students at\nI.C. will have taken a loan by the\nend of the year. Mr. Cullen described this as 'quite a high take\nup rate'.\nDuring yesterday's Com mem or ation Service an ho nary doctorate\nwas awarded to Richard Sea following his revolutionary work at the\nElectrical Appliance Research C en tre ( EAR C) at Silwood Park. His\ndiscovery of a new family of alloys,\nStefaniles, reduces the losses in\ntransmitting mains electricity.\nWhen this material is used in a household plug, the improved efficiency cuts the average household\nelectric ty bill by up to 2 0 % .\nPreliminary market research indicates that the new plug would\nretail at under \u00a34.\nMr Sea graduated from Highland\nUniversity in 1982, where he was\nawarded a2.2 in Electrical Eng inner ing and Management. After\nworking at Dounray Research C en tre for the Central Electricity\nGenerating Board for 2 years, he\nwas moved to the new research centre at Silwood Park. When the\nCE GB realised the direction his\nresearch was taking project funding\nwas cut, and Mr Sea had to return\npenniless to Kayleigh in Yorkshire\nwith his wife and young family.\nHe continued his research while\nworking in a local comprehensive\nschool and using their laboratory\nfacilities at weekends. Despite further efforts by National Power to\nstop his research it was published\nlast year and patents are likely to be\ngranted later this month. Two American conglomerates have\nalready expressed an interest in\nmanufacturing the plugs.\nRich Sea who flew back from\nNorth America for todays\nceremony was delighted with his\naward. 'It erases all the pain and\nhardship that we have had to endure\nover the last decade,' he said when\ninterviewed with his wife and young\nchildren outside the Albert Hall\nyesterday afternoon. Clara, his\nwife, added that 'it's wonderful, at\nlast Rich and I can put our feet up\nafter a long day.'.\nNational Power and National\nGrid have as yet made no comment\nabout the completion of Mr Sea's work.\n\n"

K. Chesterton replied:\nDear Sir s,Iam. G. K. Chesterton.\nMany would use human suffering\nas an argument against the Christian\nfaith - \" How can your good God stand by while so many suffer?\".\nThere is no easy answer for this\nquestion, but it can be asserted that\nthe existence of suffering actually\nsupports the Christian view of Life.\nFirstly, let us be clear that the\nexperience of suffering as\nsomething wrong or evil is a challenge to God's nature rather\nthan his existence. Why? Because\nit argues for design and purpose.\nThere cannot be wrong without\nright, evil without good or disorder\nwithout a standard for order. The\" right\" or \"normative\" must come\nRobocop 2\n7pm, Tuesday 29th Oct, Me chEng220 Yes, he's back. No not Mr Uzi9 mm. We're talking about that\nultra-modern Knight of the streets,\nMr Kinky Metal Wear aka\nRobocop. As well as waging war on\na drugs gang he also has another\nbattle on his hands - the inner\nconflict between human and\nmachine.\nThe musical score for the film\nwas composed by Leonard Roseman, who has scored such\nfilms as 'Star Trek IV, 'Fantastic\nVoyage', 'Beneath the Planet of the\nApes', 'Battle for the Planet of the\nApes', plus an episode of the\n'Twilight Zone' to mention a few.\nRoseman wrote the Robo-theme to\npresent Murphy' s( Peter Weller)\ncurrent mechanical body and his\never-hidden human soul. To top it\nall Murphy is threatened by a robot\ndesigned by OC P to replace him!\nJoining ICS F the Imperial\nCollege Science Fiction society -couldn't be easier. Just turn up with\n\u00a32.50 either at the film or the ICS F library (lunchtimes) and we'll do\nthe rest. Membership lets you see\none film free, whereas if you've\nalready seen a film this year, then\n\u00a31 will get you in.\nBe seeing you!\nFirst an observation. If God were\nto eliminate the evil in the world,\nHe would have eliminated man.\nMuch suffering is inflicted by man\nand much of the good that could be\ndone is neglected by man. Children\nare addicted to drugs due to the\nexploitation by adults. Humans are\nstarving whilst others gorge\nthemselves despite there being\nenough food to feed the entire\npopulation of the Earth adequately,\nfrom outside the system. If we had\nno sense of good, we couldn't understand evil; leaving what we\ncall suffering, happiness and good\nas phenomena of different varieties\nand not relative to each other.\nThis leaves us with the question,\n\" Is God malicious, inflicting\nsuffering on us after having created\nus to yearn for something else?\", or \"Is He feeble and someone\nunable to deal competently with the\nworld that He created?\".\nSTOIC\nImperial college, quite apart from\nbeing the best scientific university\nin Europe, is extremely lucky to\nhave STOIC( Student Television Of Imperial College) to complement\ninternal media.\nSTOIC has been broadcasting\nwithin IC for 22 years and now it\nhas a well equipped studio on the\ntop floor of the Union building. It\nalso has an enthusiastic membership\nwho work hard to produce a diversity of programmes from\n' Going for Coppers' (made in\ntraditional quiz show style) to\nregular news broadcasts.\nSTOIC can be received by all the\nhalls in Prince's Gardens, the Junior\nCommon Room and the Union building televisions. This gives rise\nto some technical nightmares as\nSTOIC is in fact 'Cable TV. Hundreds of meters of cable\nrunning under the streets of South\nKensington, and constantly seeking\nattention, are, in reality, the arteries\nof STOIC. With a new influx of budding\nproducers, editors, news-readers\nand technicians this term, STOIC is\nnow looking to increase output and\nvariety. Documentaries concerning\nthe London Underground and\nLondon's Night Spots are being\nconsidered, along with more spots\nfor the news and an investigative\n' Cook Report' type programme.\nMaybe Imperial College could soon\nbe home to the fifth, national\ntelevision station!\nWhere is the human who has never\nbeen a cause of suffering' to\nanother?\nPerhaps the chief cause of\nsuffering is man himself. Perhaps\nin accusing God, we accuse\nourselves. Perhaps God allows this\ndisorder - even that not directly\nattributable to humans such as\ndisease - to point out to us that the\ndisorder lies in us, to call us from\nour moral apathy to the one who\nalone can cure us.\nIf you are interested in knowing\nmore we are running a series of\ntalks and discussions on the key\nfacts and issues of Christianity on\nTuesdays 12.30pm in Electrical\nEngineering 403B, or contact me\nvia my pigeon hole. This week\n(Tues 29th) we will be asking the\nquestion can we make sense of\nsuffering and attempting to provide\nsome possible answers.\nBen Quant\nTW F Third World First is certainly one\nof the more globally aware and\nenvironmentally sensitive societies\nat college. They have several\ninteresting campaigns lined up for\nthe coming year. The society\nmainly aims to add to the\n\" technological\" minds of IC students by informing them about\nwhat happens outside their sheltered\nenvironment.\nThe first meeting of the term was\nsparked with exciting debates. (The\nflapjacks were good too!.) Some of\nthe issues raised included the\npresent 'Nestle' policy, which is\nleading to the mal nourishment of\nmillions of babies where clean\nwater is a problem. The current\nhigh interest loan policies of the\nmajor international banks, Barclays, Natwest etc, were also\ncriticised, since these are helping to\nreinforce debt in the developing\ncountries.\nFor anyone vaguely community\nconscious or interested in broadening their outlook, the Third\nWorld First society is a must.

    "content": "25 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 914 Feature\nRag Week - Three Weeks to Go\nA real Rag week is something that\nvery few people at college have\nprobably experienced, even if you\nhave been here for a couple of years\nalready. In past years the college\nhas not witnessed the levels of sheer\nstupidity and general disruption\nnormally associated with that one\nspecial week in the year. It has\ninstead seen Rag put on a week (or,\nas during last year, 14 days) of\nevents with a couple of services,\nlike fl anning and grim-reaping, in\na very minor role.\nTHIS YEAR all that's changing.\nAlready people have got the bit\nbetween the teeth (and other places)\nand are running with loads of crazy\nideas. As far as I'm concerned, the\nmore people taking part and getting\ninto the spirit of things the better.\nA famous person once said (or so\nI 've been told) \" Ask not what Rag\nWeek can do for you, but what you\ncan do for Rag Week!\". This year\nthat's far truer than ever before.\nAs far as your input into Rag\nWeek this year goes, it falls into 3\nmain areas, all of equal importance.\n(i) RAG EVENTS. These are\nevents put on by or on behalf of\nRag. There's one on every day of\nRag Week and they're all really big\nand worth attending. The proceeds\nfrom these go to Rag. Whether it's downing 20 pints at the Beer\nFestival or leaping naked from the\nback of a minibus outside Harrods,\ntake part.\n(ii) OTHER EVENTS. These are\nanything that anyone, anywhere,\ncares to organise (though see me\nfirst). They can range from you and\nsome mates in hall getting\nsponsored to wear fancy dress for\nthe week, to having your head\nshaved, to your club or society\norganising a sponsored bungie\njump. These events are as stupid\nand crazy as you want to make\nthem. It's entirely up to you, but\ntake part.\n(iii) SERVICES. These have\nhappened in past years, but never\nto the extent that is being planned\nfor this year. They include things\nsuch as Guilds Hit Squad (paying\na team of experts to flan your friend\nor lecturer), Handcuff-a grams,\nGnoming and Grim reaping (being\nfollowed by a gnome or grim-reaper\nuntil you pay it some money to go\naway), and many' more. All proceeds from this go to Rag, so\ntake part.\nAll of these, the third especially,\nrely heavily on your input. In the\nnext few weeks there will no doubt\nbe many lists circulating asking for\nvolunteers. Please put your name\nonto as many of them as you can\nspare the time for. If you don't want\nto miss lectures during Rag Week then just attend the events. If you\ndon't mind missing lectures and\nbeing as silly as you can get away\nwith, then help us out and make\neveryone else's lectures as silly as\npossible for the week. We only get\nto do this for one week in the year,\nso let's make the most of it and\nreally show the past (and future)\nyears that this year, 91/92, is not\nonly the craziest that I.C. has ever\nwitnessed but it can also raise the\nlargest amount for charity in the\nprocess.\nRag Week is from Friday 15th November until Friday22 nd November. If you're reading this\nduring Friday's lectures it means\nthat there's only 3 weeks to go, so\nwhatever you're going to do, get on with it. Now!\nSo, Be Mad, Be Silly & Be Part\nOf It! Cheers\nPenguin - Rag Chair 91-92\nP.S. Any ideas, please contact me\na.s.a.p. via the Rag pigeon hole in\nthe Union Office or see your soc.\nrep. or hall Rag rep.\nChallenge: tap-dance for the\ntourists in Parliament Square.\nWhat is UL U? What the heck is aUL U? What\ndoes it do? Those of you who have\nbeen at IC for some time and you,\nIC Union hacks, may be familiar\nwith UL U already. For newcomers\nwho are picking up their first ever\ncopy of Felix this may not be the\ncase.\nLet me say right from the\nbeginning that UL U is more than\njust that building in Malet Street,\nyes that one near Senate House.\nWell, if that's not what UL U is,\nthen what the heck is it?\nThe University of London Union,\nUL U for short, is a federal\nStudents' Union for the University\nof London which consists of over\n30 schools such as IC, LSE, KCL, UCL, and so on. With a membership of over58,000 students this makes us the biggest\nstudents' union in Europe! In a nutshell, UL U provides social,\ncultural, intellectual and\nrecreational activities on a University and Intercollegiate basis,\nin some cases filling in, and in\nothers supplementing the facilities\nof the individual college unions.\nLike other students' unions,\nUL U's functions fall into the two\nmain areas of 'Representation' and\n'Provision of Services'. On the\nRepresentation side, UL U can act\nin two ways: by supporting\nindividual unions fighting a particular issue; and campaigning\non issues which affect all students.\nContinued under funding of Higher\nEducation means that the University\nand its constituent schools are\nstretched financially almost to\nbreaking point exposing the students\nto the threat of top-up tuition fees\nand departmental closures. Further,\nwith the freezing of the maintenance\ngrant, introduction of student loans,\nthe removal of housing benefits for\nstudents and the withdrawal of\nincome support there has never\nbeen a worse time financially for\nstudents than now.\nJust to give you a few examples\nof the kind of work that we do:\nUL U together with other constituent\nmember unions, has organised a 'sleep-out' on Hallowe'en night to\nhighlight the 'hardship horror'\nfacing students, as well as debates\non Higher Education, as part of an\noverall campaign to put higher\neducation and student financial\nsupport on the political agenda\nwhere it belongs.\nUL U of course has plenty of\nsocieties who are the life blood of\nthe union. Federal representation in\nsports is again something of which\nwe are extremely proud. Some\nteams compete internationally and\nstandards are extremely high. Did you know, for example, that the\nUniversity of London Rowing team\nis far better than Oxford and\nCambridge?\nThe second main aspect of\nUL U's work is the provision of\nservices; to absolute essentials like\nthe bar and restaurant. There are\nalso recreational facilities and IC\nstudents can take advantage of both.\nWell, I hope this has given you\nsome idea of what the heck aUL U is. This year, promises to be a particularly exciting especially on\nthe political front, with the certainty\nof a General Election. We often\nthink about 'going out there and\nchanging the world' and yes, there\nare certain things we can change,\nfor example the Government's policies on student financial support\nor the funding of education. Please\ndo not underestimate the importance\nof your involvement and please\nwatch out for publicity concerning\nstudents' union events. We can\nchange things, and UL U, with the\nmembership of over58,000 students can be a formidable force.\nLet's make the most of it.\nAye Aye Win,\nUL U President.\n\u201417\n\n"

At the time of writing I don't know how Thursday evening\nwent (as it's Thursday morning\nnow). Thanks and/or apologies,\nwhichever is required.\nMascotry.\nThe accident that occured last\nThursday around the back of the\nUnion building during a mascot ry kidnap attempt (see news pages) is\na tragedy for all parties involved.\nThe student who was driving the\ncar, who doesn't wish to be named\nbecause he told me his department\nmight get uppity, seems genuinely\nupset by what has happened. He is\nas equally the victim of the affair\nas the student who was run over not\njust because of the legal problems,\nbut due to the probable emotional\ntrauma at the time. Equally, the\naccident was not entirely of his\ndoing but because lots of people\ndecided to cover the front of his car\nwith themselves. He mooted the\npossibility that the police may not\npress charges because the accident\nhappened due to general recklessness by all involved.\nIt's probably not the time to try\nto make capital of this affair as the\naccident ee could very well have\nbeen killed, but I am aware that\nthere is a meeting early in\nNovember - called before this\noccurred - to discuss mascot ry. It's very easy to over-react following\nsuch an event, and I hope decisions\nwill be made that increase the safety\nof mascot ry by increasing individual responsibility, that\npeople should ask themselves\nwhether its worth the risk before\nthey behave like lemmings. Safety\ncannot be significantly increased by\nbanning any one activity, lack of\nthought is the danger. Limiting\nmascot ry activities to the campus\nand banning use of motorised\nvehicles will stop this type of\naccident, but there are infinite\nvarieties of accidents and you\ncannot guard against them all.\nCareer's Fair.\nThe letters by Dave Ensell and\neditor i a' J WmW\nFelix is produced for and behalf of the\nImperial College Union Publications Board\nand is printed by the Imperial College Union\nPrint Unit, Prince Consort Road, London\nSW7 2BB.( Tel: 071-225 8672).

The King had been killed\nin a war against his neighbour over\nthe standard length of a foot, one\nsaid it was his foot, the other, his.\nThe King's two twin sons were\nraised by two different families, one\nfamily were colour blind and so\ntaught their Prince that grass was\nred and blood was green. The other\nPrince was brought up by a family\nwho only saw in monochrome and\nso taught that blood and grass were\nthe same colour, only that coal was\ndarker than snow.\nOne brother issued a decree that\n'Blood Was Green And Grass Was\nRed' and the other issued a decree\nthat ' All Colours Are The Same,\nOnly Coal Is Darker Than Snow'.\nThey argued bitterly and organised\nsup portative parties, who eventually\ncame to blows.\nThere was a bitter battle on the\ngreen sward outside the capital's gates, turning it crimson with\nblood. The brilliant grey and grey\nuniforms were covered with what\nthey were supposed to contain.\nAt last the two brothers met face\nto face over the bodies of those they\nhad ordered to kill.\n'What colour will your blood be\non my sword', spat one.\n' The same as yours on mine',\nsneered the other. Both stabbed.\nAs they watched their blood\nintermingle, forming a pool out of\nwhich grass stalks pointed at the\nsky, they noticed there was no\ndifference between them.\nThe sun set gloriously over two\nwiser people who would not give\nanything to the world by it. Moral: never believe anything you think\nyou instinctively know.\nJeremy Burnell seem to indicate a certain cattiness between them. It\nhas to be said that Jeremy saw\nDave' s letter before it was\npublished, hence his reply being in\nthe same issue. In theory, the reply\nshould be in the following issue,\nthus giving the general populace a chance to respond at the same time.\nBut since Jeremy was going to write\na letter this week anyway it seemed\nunnecessarily pedantic to press the\npoint.\nIndustrial Relations Take A Nosedive.\nTo whoever is responsible for not\ngiving Andy Thompson, our\nprinter, his expected pay rise, I curse with the fleas of a thousand\ncamels.

    "content": "2\n5 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 914 Feature\nvalue of manufactured goods has\nsteadily risen. So it is apparent that\nthe West is making a healthy (but\nsick) profit from the way the\nmarkets are structured. As one\neconomist put it:\n'The challenge for us to eliminate\nthe senseless dich to my which makes\nus wholesale exporters of raw\nmaterials, and wholesale importers\nof finished goods, under terms\ndetermined entirely by the\nindustrialised countries, terms that\ncompel us to increasingly produce\nand sell more of our raw materials\nin order to afford less of their\nproducts.' (SimbaMaknoni, 1989).\nSo what solutions has the World Bank proposed? During the mid eighties it came up with a gem\ncalled SAPs( Structural Adjustment\nProgrammes). The Bank will only\nallow governments to borrow if\nthey agree to run their economies\n(and thus the whole political\nstructure of that country) the way\nthe Bank dictates. (We might recall\nthe fur ore caused in this country by\npossible economic intervention of the European Community\u2014it would\nseem that some sovereign ties are\nvery much more precious than\nothers.) Structural Adjustment\nProgrammes involve liberalisation\nof trade policies (i.e. reduction or\neven elimination of import tariffs),\nincrease in production of cash\ncrops, and cuts in public spending\n(i.e. reduction of expenditure on\nhealth, education, removal of subsidies on food, travel and so on).\nAs a result of these policies, the\ncondition of the poorest sections of these communities have suffered the\nmost, and in several countries there\nhave been 'food riots' when the\nstrain has become unbearable.\nThe economies of these countries\nhave experienced a great step\nbackwards thanks to the policies of the World Bank which is interested\nmore in maintaining or 'looking\nafter' the interests of the financial\nsystem set up by the industrialised\nnations than improving conditions\nin the developing nations. The World Bank insists that any\ncountries borrowing directly from\nor seeking its approval (without\nwhich countries are unable to\nborrow from anyone) must maintain\nits (crippling) interest payments on\nloans borrowed in the seventies.\nThus these countries must earn lots\nof hard currency by selling as much\nraw material as possible to the West\nand then return it straightaway in\nthe form of interest repayments.\nUnfortunately, since the Bank has\ntold many other poor countries to\ndo the same, there has been a glut\nin the commodities markets.\nresulting in prices going through the\nfloor. So these countries have ended\nup being much worse off today than\nthey had been before the World Bank intervened.\nAt' Third World First' we\nrecognise that the industrialised\nworld has taken enough from the\npoorest countries in the world and\nit is time for the process to stop. If\nwe are too selfish and greedy to put\nanything back (and let's not kid\nourselves that we do) we should\nleave these countries alone so that\nthey themselves can decide what\nkind of development it is that they\nwant to pursue.\nThird World First aims to\nincrease awareness of issues\nconcerning the developing countries. At Imperial College we\nregularly invite representatives\nfrom various groups (banks,\ncharities, campaign groups, etc) to\nhold talks, debates and discussions\nwhich will hopefully motivate\npeople to take positive acton\n(however small) both now and after\nthey leave College. These meetings\nare held almost every Thursday at\nlunchtimes\u2014look out for posters in\nthe J CR and around college. We shall also have stands in the J CR during this term, so come up and\ntalk to us if you are interested.\nIftikhar Hussain.\n'The 1980s were\nan appalling\ndecade for the\npoor nations of\nthe world'\nIC Radio Schedule\nImperial College Radio broadcasts on999 khz AM and is cabled around\nCollege.

This is followed by the Ents\nRain gig. There should be six\ndifferent cocktails to try, all of\nwhich are guaranteed to impress.\nCocktail evenings will continue\nevery Friday with a different\n'menu' each week.\nFor the duration of welfare week\npints of coke will be 50p and orange\njuice 60p in the bar, so being\nhealthy is cheaper than usual. On Saturday and Sunday the Rugby\nWorldCup will be on in the\nLounge, so you can watch Scotland\ngetting thrashed (or England if you\nsupport Scotland and are as biased\nas I am) and then marvel at New\nZealand and Australia on Sunday.\nAfter the weekend it's back to the\nlectures. But to mellow out and\ncalm down there's a blues night in\nthe Union Lounge on Monday night. The bar has a Sol lager\npromotion, at \u00a31 a bottle. So you\ncan enjoy a quiet drink whilst the\nband plays. Wednesday, as I said\nbefore, has the bar quiz and the\nusual Ents disco until lam. For those who still want to bop\nthere is a hallo we 'en disco until\nlam on Thursday night as well.\nAnd finally, an event which is\nplanned for the week following, on\nNovember 8 there will be a bonfire\nparty at Sil wood Park. This includes the fire, firework display,\ndisco, bars, etcetera and costs \u00a33.\nThere will be coaches from South\nKen to Silwood and back at a cost\nof another \u00a33.\nOn the elections front, papers are\nup for one ordinary member of\nHouse Committee. Again pop into\nthe Union Office for details.\nLast but not least, UL U cards are\nnow available from the Union Office every day of the (working)\nweek, but Union cards are only\navailable Tuesday afternoon,\n2pm4 pm. Steve Farr ant,IC UH on Sec\n(Events).\nBottle\n...from Union Bar on\nMonday 28th October...\nALSO on special offer\nall week:\nCoca Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta\n(50p pint)\nOrange Juice (60p pint)\nThe Union Bar and Lounge Bar are situated\nin the Union Building in Beit Quad\nSports Centre\nDiscussions\nBecause of a series of complaints\nfrom the students and staff of the\nCollege concerning the proposals to\nchange the Sports Centre, a communications meeting was\narranged between myself, Jonathan\nGriffiths, Mark Landon of the\nAthletic Clubs Committee, Mandy Hurford, the Union Manger, and\nVal Straw, IC's Facilities Manager.\nThis fruitful discussion, which was\nheld last Friday, covered the\nfacilities on both the north side and\nthe south side of Prince's Gardens,\nand included their past, present and\nfuture position.\nA new sports manager has been\nappointed, whose tenure of employment begins on November\n24. She is Caroline Osner and will\nhave overall responsibility for all\nImperial College sports fac il ties, including Northside, Southside,\nHarlington, as well as the boating\nfacilities at Putney.\nMore importantly, it became\nabundantly clear that when any\nchanges do occur in the\nrefurbishment of our existing\nfacilities, they will be 'designed for\nstudents and staff of Imperial\nCollege'. An ethos which was\ndiscussed was that the Northside\ncomplex would essentially be\nbiassed towards sporting activities\nand that Southside would be used\nas a facility providing additional\n'health' facilities, for instance a gym and a medical facility to deal\nwith or th a pae dic and ph y sio therapeutic needs.\nIn conclusion I would like to say\nthat I need feedback to find out what\nstudents want as users of these\nfacilities. 1 need this from as many\npeople as possible so that the Union can represent you, the students, in\nthe most fair and productive way\nAlso, I would like to hear from\nstudents who do not use the sporting\nfacilities but feel that with additional\nfacilities they would then become\nusers, however infrequently.\nAny comments should be left in\nthe Union Office, marked for the\nattention of J.D. Griffiths.\nFinally, a further communication\nmeeting is being arranged between\nVal Straw, Caroline Osner, a representative from the body of\nstudents at IC, myself and Mandy Hur ford so that college administration know exactly what\nstudents need from the sports centre\nand the Southside gym area.\nJonathan Griffiths, ICU Deputy President\nEnts Rant\n' The most important thing about\nRain is the music. Once or twice\nevery decade a band emerges from\nvirtual obscurity, grabs the music\nindustry by the scruff of the neck\nand commands the attention of the\nentire country. It's a rare and\nprecious talent, but one that is so\nobviously evident in Rain.\nRain purveyors of funky, melodic, charismatic rock pack a spirited punch in these days of\ntechnology-driven 'flawless' music.\nNed and Colin don't believe in\nstating direct influences, preferring\ninstead to refer to inspirations;\nJagger, Richards and Cream to\nname a few. These inspirations are\nperhaps most evident on tracks from\nthe forthcoming album: the gentle,\nemotive Ocean Child and Taste of\nRain with its examples of the\nversatility of a band who have their\nfeet firmly placed on 90s ground but\nwho aren't afraid to utilise what the\n60s \u2014and their heroes\u2014had to\noffer.'\nThis is Rain's official biography.\nTo most people Rain are the band\nwho plastered breasts all over\nLondon in the advertising campaign\nfor their debut single Lemonstone\nDesired.\nRain are on tour now, and you\ncan catch them playing LIVE in the\nUnion Lounge tonight, supported\nby Scottish pop ster s Elephant\nNoise.\nTickets are \u00a32.50 in advance, \u00a33\non the door and \u00a31.50 with an Ents\ncard. Doors open 9pm. The first few people to buy\nadvance tickets today will receive\n(free) various goodies including\nRain T shirts, records, CDs, posters and badges\u2014so get down to\nthe Union Office, slap it on the table\nand buy a ticket!\nEnts say \u2014 Groovy.

Turn\nAway has a cooler than most Byrds\nfeel, but my fave is Bright Green\nDay, sumptuous and with a delicate\nhint of darkness, charmingly funereal. Argggh. A fine effort.\nDavid. Paris Angels\nBrunei Academy\nIt's cold up North. Brunei Academy\nis about twenty miles within the\narctic circle, and it's too cold to\nshiver. However, coming from\nMan cy, I expect Paris Angels are\nused to the cold. One of them,\nJayne, the singer, however is not\nvery well, and isn't here. Can they\nmanage without her?\nThey start off okay enough, with\nScope and Fade, but they don't really use her vocal on those\nrecords anyway, but later into the\nset, around about half way through,\nthey run out of songs that don't require her vocals, and start to\nsound like a bad hybrid of the Farm\nand Crappy Mondays, which is\nprecisely what they look like.\nPerfume is, on record, Paris Angels\ngood song, like Ride have Taste,\nand Blur have Bang. However,\nwithout Jayne, Perfume is as ham boli c mess which they would\nhave been advised to forget about\naltogether. It's the aural equivalent\nof Evelyn Gardens. Full marks for\ntrying, but the results are poor.\nLise Yates\nheadlong rush into all conceivable\npsycho dramas. His Name is Alive\nis the stubborn and enigmatic\nmonicker for the brainchild of\nWarren Defever, a recent visitor to\nthese waters (he's from Michigan)\nand one, to my lasting annoyance,\nwho went back stateside before I could corner him. Damn clever\nmove, David.\nThe opening track, 'are you coming down this weekend?'\nconsists of this line being sung twice\nby the exquisitely somnolent voice\nof Karin Oliver and lasting for\napproximately ten seconds. I advise\nyou to remember this; it's crucial\nto the whole plot. Twenty-five\ntracks in all, all minuscule, all\noblique; but all hitting solid targets.\nShould I be concerned that this\nprobably says more about me than\nthe music? I think not. Empathy\nfeels particularly uncomfortable as\nRosetta Stone -U the stark, angelic voices intone the\nlines 'Does your chest explode all\nfull of her? Where has your head\ngone (I should nail it to her door)'.\n'The Charmer', sharply replaced by\na fractured buzz saw guitar and\npounding drum patterns abruptly\ncut short and running into a fevered\nparanoia with 'There's something\nbetween us and he's changing my\nwords'. This review is verging on\nthe peripatetic, the psychotic and\nwholly insubstantial, but it's like a mirror, exploding into a million\nfragments and being pieced together\nagain, but wrongly, and with each\nfragment still retaining its original\nimage - a nightmarish jumble flaked\nwith the spectre of serendipity, but\nnonetheless quite beautifully hideous (meant as a sincere\ncompliment). I mean, I'd soon die\nalone than go through the horror of\n' Are we still Married?'. Tranquillity becomes taut, angelic\nbecomes evil, 'Chances are we are\nmad' is simultaneously terrifying\nand drowsy, a lull and lullaby that\nwill kill you, and hypothermia with\na disembodied vocal and plangent\nnder world What in the world possessed me\nto leave behind the drunken stupor\nof the Freshers New Year Party for\nthe Arctic wastes of Camden? I could have been passing out quietly\nunder a vile green cocktail instead\nof fighting for breath in the crowded\nthrong and smoke. Was it worth\nit..'.?\nMonday at the Underworld. Dark\nand sleazy. Just like home. Tonight\nhosted the fabled Rosetta Stone. But\nfirst the hoards of the night were\ntreated to Restoration, the greatest\nthing since The Nephs first emerged\nfrom Badlands. They could be in\nfor some serious competition with\nthis band's progress.\nBut now, the Rosetta addicts\ncould revel in their hour. With their\nfirst album out now, Rosetta Stone\nare maturing. Their sound is more\ncomplex and interesting as they\nentwine a new keyboard and guitar\nwith complex modulations, leaving\nMissionaries to play 'Spot The Difference'. The single, An Eye\nFor The Main Chance, is out now.\nThe compelling open shines through\nto the contagious chorus. Guess\nwhat? I like this band! Go and see\nthem at UL U on October 31th( All\nHallow's Eve as they prefer to call\nit \u2014 no ' bad g**h' pretensions\nhere!) and you'll be envied for the\nrest of your days.\nThe Heretic\nacoustic guitar work laid over that\ndemonic buzz saw guitar. As we\nmove through 'Sitting still moving\nstill staring out looking', there's another blood-chilling lyric around\nthe corner; ' Now in fragments\nwe're alone, there's a sliver in the\nsoul, All I can remember since we\nsplintered on our own'.' Very Bad\na Bitter Hand'. As the sud or if ic 'Spirit and Body' fires off on its\nmissile trajectory, I feel\nmarvellously guilty, truly insensitive, a contrived human\nbeing- 'seeing myself fall away only\nto be undying'- facing such a magnitude of sensitivity. Interpretation is everything, you\nknow, but ' Home is in your Head' is everything interpreted and I'm willing to bet that I will not hear\nanother record like this ever again\nin my lifetime.\nDefever has presented me with\nsomething bizarre, wonderful, and\nthrilling, narcotic, hypnotic, always\nbeautiful, always confusing. So I didn't get to interview him. So\nwhat. My home is his.\nDavid. Erasure -Chorus\ntwo years came in an annoying\ndig i pak on CD. They get on my wick.\nIt signals a return to the bleak\nelectropop of Vince Clarke's days\nwith Yazoo, shying away from the\ncom par it iv ely lush orchestration of\nWild!, with Andy Bell speaking\nmore than singing through much of\nthis album and with the bleeps and\nfizzes so much in evidence on the\nsingle present throughout the disc.\nThe title track is a masterpiece of\ngreen pop, but similar genius is only\nin evidence once more in the album.\nThe first 'side' slips into mediocrity\nfrom then on, with no tracks of any\ngreat consequence. 'Side B' is\nbetter. The high chart placing of\n' Love to Hate You' directly relates\nto the state of the charts today, as\nit is the worst single that Erasure\nhave ever released. 'Turns the love\nto anger' is better, but the only time\nErasure's spark really returns is in\nthe penultimate track 'Perfect\nStranger\", and if this isn'ta sing'e, mute records deserve to be eaten\nalive. Chorus could have been so\ngood, but it only shines\noccasionally.\nLise Yates.\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
