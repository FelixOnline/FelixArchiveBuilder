    "content": "FELIX\nIf\nWHAT ARE YOU GIVING UP FOR LENT? Shrove Tuesday dawned bright and\nfair, but the promise of that bright morning was not, alas, to be fulfilled. As is the case so often, 'the best laid pl and of mio e and men, gang aft a pancake'. >md so it was that Les i OLl en led his men forth under threatening skies,\nwhile in the dist nee an ob liga to on a muted eccles cake was heard, and taken\nas an ill omen by the augurs.\nThe recently engaged Preside it of\nICWA, engaging her gears in an engaging\nfashion, engaged to do battle. This\nengagement was made before the engagement\nso to speak. In fact they enga-ed to\nrun fi or ster\" At the gun, Les ran first just as\nJolyon Nove came fourth in a fifth rate\nsquare fashion. Round the ob loi g they\ncircled and then the sides were one ned and the rains came vertically. A horizontal sprint in a counter clockwise\ndirection produced a lead.\nIt was at this point that .Tolyon1\ns towel was shown in its true colours.\nThe executive never lost their lead,\nand the dog is reported to have rabies.\nBut as Les Allen was not heard to remark,\n\" If you wish to win in the Olympic Games,\nbecome a Russian.\"\nGENTLEMAN JO LYON CAL US TORR BE On the last day of February a new\nseries of j a per bac xc books was introduced\nOnto the British market.\nThis series has long been popular\nin America among students and in tell i gent laymen d^e to its choice of subjects aimed at the more discriminating\nreader.\nGalaxy BOOKS have opened tn eir series in this country with such admirable \"v vor KSa3 Bertrand Russell's \"Irob-lem s of 1hilo soph y*', Max Weber' 3 \"ft s says on Sociology\" and C,_S. Lewis's \"Allesrory\nof Love\".\nhowever, dae to the fact that they\nare printed in America they are rather\nni.'h priced. jiu t the almost prohibitive v rice for r.a per bae vs is overcome\nby their subject matter.\nAs the problems ana struggles of\nintegration seen to be in the forefront\nof the news at the present time and\nappear to be of general interest to most\npeople, 'The Strange Career of Jim Grow'\nby C. Vann Woodward ^price has been\nchosen from this new series.\nSegregation is only the latest phrase\nin the long hi tory of the white man's ways of fixing the Negroe's status or 'his\nT lace in society1. In earlier h..rs her times bondage ana limited servitude have\nbeen used. Slavery* peonage and abortive\ntypes of apprenticeship have also had\ntheir day. Exploitation of the Negro\nby the white man goes bacK to the\nbeginning of relations between the races\nand so do race conflict brutality and\ninjustice. Along with these practices, the\nassumptions of Kegro inferiority and\nwhite superiority have also developed\nand prospered. These assumptions\nare the basis of segregation as we\nknow it and so it can be concluded that\nthe whole of this particular modern race\nhatred i. as its origins in the remote period of negro slavery.\nThis book is a concise ana revealing\naccount of the development of segregation\nfollowing the withdrawal of trie :<\\dera-tion troops from the Southern States of\nAmerica in 1377 up to the present day.\nThis period of history which is still, covered by a fairly thick cloak of\nobscurity, during which the 'Jim Crow1\nsystem of segregation came about is dealt with quite fully in an easily\nunderstandable way, giving one a complete view of the problems involved.\nThe booK has been made up from a series of iec ture s given at the Unive rsi ty of Virginia in1934 and has since\nbeen brought up to date. The lectures\nwere given to an u \u00ab*e# F>ated audience\nand were received with acclaim from\nboth 'sides'.\nl.r. Vann Woodward was born in Arkansas and is now Ixofessor of\nHistory at the John Hopkins Jniversity.\nHe has lived in the South all his life and is particularly interested in the\nproblems of segregation.\nhe is also the author of three\nother booKS on the same subject; Tom\nViatoon, Reunion and Reaction, and\nOrigins of -he hew South.\nThis book should be read by anyone who is at all interested in the\nsubject of segregation. It is a well-balanced survey bringing forth each\nr. has e of the race relations of the\nsouthern states with clarity, emphasising\nthe importance of the political, economic and social conditions of the time,\nby a well Known authority who has had\na wide experience of its exploitation\nand effect.\n(W.B. Jim Crow is a name given to\nthe general American ne^ro, similar to\nUncle Sam. ' Derivation unknown).\nTHE BLOOD MAN COMETH It is please nt to be able to\nreport that just over 150 students\nand ^several staff have volunteered\nto give blood when the Blood Transfusion Unit visits I.J. It was\nnecessary to get an idea how many\nvolunteers there would be at I.C. to determine whether a visit would\nbe wort n while and the Blood Transfusion Unit will therefore be at I.C. on Tuesday, 22n>< March, in the last week of term.\n;\n3\ny the time you re ac this there\nwill be a notice in the Union Entrance\nHail on which you can put your name\nagainst a convenient time during one\nvisit.

    "content": "WHAT IS SUCCESS How does one Judge success? In a materialistic world it is inevitable\nthat success is primarily.based on\nmaterialistic standards. And^et inside\neach of us there is an inner 3et of\nspiritual values wh i oh contributes an\nimportant part of that integral we o all success. We therefore impose certain o on ditions an gT pr Tnc ip les. in pur minds.\nWe set a limit. We choose a limit, the\nheight\" of wh i oh depends on our individual personality, but below which our\nintegral sense of values and proportion\nwill not permit us to go however great\nthe material sense of success that\nawaits us there. Life is tolerable only\nif we first achieve success within ourselves. Materialistic success, then\nelevates life from being usually tolerable to varying degrees of pleasantness;\nSo says Mr. Clifford Odets whose\nplay \"The Big Knife\" is based on this theme.\nCharlis.Castle is a renowned\nHollywood movie star and Hoff Federated' s biggest box office draw. He is rich, handsome, charming and in tell i gent. But he has reached the height of\nhis career by sacrificing his integrity, stooping beneath the ' line', and'sinning\nagainst his own nature', his conscience\ndoes not allow him to compromise the\nperson that he was with the person that\nhe is. Nor can he reconcile both his wife, whom he loves, and the whole of\nthe movie industry, with its producers,\ntycoons and businessmen, who all bring\npressure to bear on him- to move him in the opposite direction.\nWhat is the solution? Clifford Odets suggests that it needs a materia list ic act of tragedy to wrest success\nfrom failure and to redeem that dignity\nand self respect necessary to live with\noneself.\nThe Play itself is set against a Hollywood background in atypical Beverley Hill House - large, luxurious\nand modern, fully equip ed with swimming\npool and tennis courts. The people,\nagain are those that can be found only\nin Hollywood, colourful, larger than\nlife, unscrupulous and immoral.\nAlthough the topic of the play is a serious one, the dialogue, handled by\nClifford Odets with his usual skill, is always fast moving in the smart,\nwise-cracking, American jargon y way.\nART EXHIBITION The IC art club held its annual ex-hi bit ion last week, and the technical\nquality of the paintings and drawings\nwas high.\nSome of the exhibits were extremely\nclever and some I couldn't understand at\nall. To single out any one outstanding\npainting would be difficult and not\nreally significant,since any such choice\nin necessarily personal. But a few re\nremarks are in order I think, since some\nmembers of the union seem to regard\npeople who paint or draw as strange\npeople who wear long woolen underwear\nand eat nut cutlets for breakfast.\nIt would appear that anyone who\ntries to express themselves by pan or\nbrush is likely to be held in contempt\nas a 'pseudo-intellectual', or a 'nut-case' \u2022 I would like to make a plea for a more liberal attitude to the college\nartists and a realisation that a rugby\nplayer may possibly be able to paint.\nBE A UT1C WAR I ANN29 ROSEMARY KER FOOT V THE DECISION It was a Friday morning, Ire mem ber, cold and wet. The 4-9 bus was full\nto capacity, and I sat amid a smell of\ntobacco smoKe ana drying raincoats, my\nbrief case on my knees and my umbrella\nlooking rather guilty in its small pool\nof water. There was nothing extraordinary about the journey that morning.\nA smart blonde coiffure in the seat in front proved superior to its wearer\nwhen she went downstairs. The conductor muttered something when I tendered\na pound note for a7d. fare. No, I hadn't got the penny.\nAt South Kensington, I jumped off\nthe bus at the zebra crossing as usual\nand hurried through the dr iz; le into\nthe station arcade. There, pausing to\nfold my umbrella, I saw him. He was\nat the books tall. I don't know why\nhe should have caught my attention,\nbut something in his manner prompted me\nto study him further. Somehow he didn't fit into any of\nthe standard groups one sees at such\nstalls. His was not the pimple d schoolboy approach with the so obvious\nattempted casual n ness while furtively \"reading\" the semi pornographic\" art\" publications. Nor yet was he the\nfellow who stands for hours with the\none magazine, apparently undecided\nbut in actual fact reading it from\ncover to cover. And he was definitely not the about-to-go-on-a long-journey-o an you-suggest-a book-kind.\nYes, here was something new. I paused to observe.\nAs far as I could see, he was\nundecided as to which of two publications he should buy. Intrigued, I went neater. Still he looked from\none to the other, hesitating. By\nnow I was so fascinated that I had\nto discover the cause of his quandary\nI edged nearer, looking over his shoulder. As I did so, he made his\ndecision, paid his money and picked up\nthe \"Weekend Mail\" in preference to\nthe \"Times Literary Supplement\".\nA.F. G.L. RUGBY FIVES\nThe Rugby Fives Club waa formed on\nMonday Heb. 15th. as a subsidiary of the\nSquash Club. Elected to office were :\nSecretary ; John Carter; Captain : John\nGalley. The courts, as yet unfinished,\nare situated opposite Weekea Hall between the tennis courts and the road.\nThe game for the uninitiated can be\nplayed by two or four persons, the ball, hard and leather covered with a bounce\nalmost on a par with a golf ball, is hit with the gloved hand - well padded l Basically, the rules are similar to other court games, a player being conceded\na point only when he wins his service.\nTo serve, the 3erve r stands in the right\nhand front corner (or the left one if he\nis left handed) and throws the ball, generally underarm, against the front\nwall in such a way that it will then hit the side wall and bounce where it can\nbe hit back to the side wall, front wall and over to the receiver in the other ,\nhalf of the court. Battle then commences until the ball goes out of play ( under the bar on the front wall or out of\ncourt).\nFives is rather a polymorphic game,\ndue mainly to the relatively few people\nwho play the game. Rugby fives is the\ncommoner with Eton fives( ho back wall)\nand Winchester fives (with a number of\nbuttresses scattered about just to make\nthings awkward) also played in3 ome parts of t he country, mainly in the\nschools. For those who would like to\nhave a bash the club will be purchasing\na number of gloves and balls which will be available.\nD.J. G. RUG GER Unfortunately the club lias been hit by a high percentage of injury Jhese last few weeks, which has caused one or two\ngames to b,; cancelled. Such note a bxe characters as Tom Banks (bro xe:. nose)\nand Tom King, our secretary, (broken\nwrist) are our most recent casualties.\nHowever t.is lias not prevented the\nother teams -from continuing their\nwinning way.\nSince the Cup Final, the first XV\nhas played two games. On 2/th Feb. it travelled to Cambridge and won by 8 pts.\nto 3 with a weakened side over a St.\nCats. team. Last Saturday the convincingly beat a University Vandals side\nby if tries to a penalty goal. The\nforwards? played excellently winning most\nof the set scrum s and they were ably\nsupported by a bac^ a i vision which had\nbeen promoted from the Ex 1st. Jeff Connor's Ex 1st last Saturday'\nousted Tom King's A XV from the position\nof being the highest scoring team in a single game. This feat was accomplished\nwith a58 pts. to 3 win over University\nVandals. Ironically the Vandals scored\nfirst, but it was not long before Froggett\nat outside half o ad collected a hat-trick\nof tries and J. Connor had kicked a double\nhat-trick of goals for the I.C. team. This\nwin means that they are the third I.C. team\nto top the 50 pts. mark in one game.\nPreviously the Ex A XV in their first match\n6\u00a3 the season won 30 pts. to 0, and the\nA XV has beaten the l ort of London Authori ty' A' by 53 pts. to 0.\nAnother of I.C. teams lively to run\nup such a score before the end of the season is the B III XV. This team goes\nfrom strength to strength with a win from\ntheir last meeting against U. C.H.l eli can s by 25 pts. to 6. This is a team of all talents having people in it who have col ours for hockey (2), rowing, fencing, golf,\njudo and swimming. Their proud boast is''\">'11 play anyone at anything - and\nlose\".\nOn closing these short notes the Club\nwould like to thank all these people who\ncrave their time and energy to ma*.e the\nI.C. Rugger Lance sac na success.\n\n"

Let us not\nforget that it is easy to criticise. There is one form of criticism which is welcomed by any body of work-ers, and that is. of course.-'constructive criticism. The Editor of Felix and his staff spend the whole of each\nsecond Sunday in the Peli x Room typing\nand setting out the following Friday's paper. This is not small sacrifice by such a small body of undergraduates\n- let us remember that fact. However,\nthe Editor and members of his staff are\ncontinually being jibed at by the remaining 'unproductive' students. These\npeople want to know '\"When are we going\nto get a Felix worth reading?\"\nThey are promptly told to write\nsomething which they themselves think\nis of literary merit, and it will be\npublished. I know from personal experience that the articles in Peli x are written by a select few, who are\noften members of its staff, and why?\nThe answer is simple; and it is this. Not nearly enough material is received\neach week to ensure a full edition of\neight pages so those people whom I have mentioned above spend their alternate Sundays in Felix room,\nhave to s it down and write something\nthemselves. Of course it i3 not a good method of filling a newspaper\nbut what else is there to do? I put it to you all is it asking too\nmu oh that about twenty people on the\naverage each fortnight out of nearly\nthree thousand should s it down and\ncompose a contribution for their own\npe per? By rights the Editor should\nhave so much material piled up in Felix room that he can pick and choose\narticles from one week to the next,\nbut in fact every little letter wh i oh happens to be contributed is snatched\nup for want of anything better and inserted in Felix. I feel( as a nonmember of Felix staff) that the dedicated Editor and his Staff are hitting their heads against a brick wall, and\nthat they should receive every encouragement in their work instead of\nunproductive criticisms. Look at\nthe next issue of Felix, and if you\ndon't like it please do not run to\nMike Barron and say so, but do something about it. To three thousand\nscience students I say Felix is TOUR newspaper, so for goodness sake\nfeed him with succulent articles. SEX A TO RIAL UNION MEETING The last C&G Union .,ue ting held in the IC Concert Hall was opened by Guilds\npresident ( now known as Skip). After\nthe minutes had been read, it was a.^ reed\nthat the damage done to the chairs- in04 during past Union meetings was due to\nimproper initial stressing.\nThe next item on the agenda was the\nmotion proposed by John (not to be confused with\" Jim-Jam) Garter, \"That in Order\nto Relieve Congestion in the Bar, the\nGuilds Library should be open after six p.m.\" His maiden speech left the-,\nimpression of stills and hammocks, swig-gina and swinging in the Library.\nThen the stage was cleared for action.

If they cannot they have defeated tae ir argument put forward by the Harris's in a recent issue of Felix, From 20 i ub li c School Freshers in a certain department y less than one third have come straight from school.\nIt is seldom realised that parents\nof Public School boys have usually had\nto make considerable sacrifices in order\nthat their may be sent to the schools of\ntheir choice; so that it is the\nexception rather than the rule for such\na boy to 'retire to his father's country\nresidence'.\nive have never seen a fancy waistcoat\nat I.C. waistcoats certainly, but\nneither fancy nor flamboyant, '\n.\n'\ne would\nsuggest that luminous socks are much more\nobvious at I.C. and are worn for the sole\npurpose of attracting attention to their otherwise inconspicuous wearers.

Imperial\nCollege, at present, offers the be3t social ana recreational facilities possible, yet the 3r own bag gers are as numerous as ever.\nPersonally, I cannot see why the\nBrown-b agger is so sought after Dy the\nUnion. Is he a Kind of collector's rarity? If he is as dull as he appears\nto be, why try to persuade him to take\npart in the Union activities, since his\nbrown-bagginess would surely not be an\nasset to any society.\nAs for Sleeping Log threatening to\nboycott Felix, see Felix bankrupt, and\noverthrow the 'ruling elite of this\ncollege' he should by now realise he is in cap a bae of such an action. A Coup \u00bb\nd 'Etat is outside the scope of brown-bagge ry;a night attack would have to\nbe made, which for him is impossible,\nsince by 5.15 p.m. the \" little brown mug\"\nis safely being carried home to suburbia\non the j.13 from Waterloo.\nSo snore in your sleep - Sleeping\nDog - by all means; for my part, Is hall let sleeping dogs lie, as they did in the\nlast edition of Felix.

Hockey Club\nbeat Battersea 1-0 in the .final of the\nU.L. Hockey Cup, thus fulfil xing the\ndream of a Triple Crown for I.C. The previous records of the finalists suggested an exciting game as indeed it was. Battersea had won through the most\ndifficult half of the draw ana furthermore\nhad won this championships 5 times in the\nprevious 7 years. However I.C. defeated\nBattersea 2 - 0 in the cup last season\nand also they .ad scored 15 goal3 in reaching this' final with only 3 goals scored\nagainst.\nThus with many enthusiastic supporters\nincluding a few who knew the rules and a fine pitch the stage was set for what\nturned out to be the most exciting match\nof the major sport finals.'.11 From the start I.C. attacked strongly\nforcing a short corner which Battersea managed to scramble away. The play swung\ndown to the other end of the field where\nBattersea were prevented from scoring by\na fine clearance by Lenssen in goal.\nI.C. attacked again ana were unlucky to score when a fine shot from\nDeBroeicert had the goalkeeper beaten\nbut was stopped by the leg of a Battersea full-back on the goal line. A penalty bully was awarded but I.C to convert.\nfailed Battersea returned to the attack, but\nthe I.C. defence remained firm, with Jowit\nat centre half outstanding. The ball continued to swing from end to end with\nde fe noes dominating.\nIt became apparent that the Battersea\ndefence were concentrating on the I. C.left wing which included walker the\nUniversity left winger, and consequently\nthe attack switched to the right and were\nable to make more headway. However before\nadvantage could be ta<ven of this the\nwhistle blew for half-time' with honours\neven.\nOn the resumption Battarsea attacked\nand forced a short corner from which the\nball was cleared to the I.C. right wing\nwhere Biiatnagar was master of the situ ation and with intel lig net passes put\nI.C. back on the offensive. From a free hit Bhatnagar took the ball along\nthe Battersea goal line and flicked it into the net from a very acute angle\nbehind the Battersea goalkeeper who was\nexpecting a centre.\nI.C. then proceeded to taj ie control\nana twice had the ball in the net but\neach time from an offside position.\nBattersea renewed attack with great\nvigour forcing several short corners,\nhowever, the I.C. defense held firm* and\nwith sporadic attacks from the always\ndna gero us I.C. forwards the one goal lead\nwas maintained to the end.\nThe club wishes to thank the Southern\nCounties Umpires for their handling of\nthe match the U.L. groundsman for: r ovid ing such a fine pitch and above all the many I.C. supporters without whom the\ngame might well have been lost.\n3&.\nCongratulations are due to the I.C. team which wasL-Lenssen, Miller A., Macrae^ Angell, Jowit,\nAnketell, Bhatnagar, King, DeBroekert,\nMiller M.I.( Captain), walker.\nste. TRIPLE CROWN.\nBy winning the U.L. U. Hockey Cup,I.C. have won the Triple Crown. But that is not all. The sporting triumphs of this session have 'been phenomenal, and it is difficult to see any other college ever\nemulating this feat. Apart from the three\nmajor trophies,the Swimming Club has won.\nU.L. U. Water Polo League first, division by the peculiar means of winning all their matches,and. the second team won\nthe Handioap Knockout competition: the\nBasketball Club won the London Amateur\nBasketball Association League Division Onei the Cros3 Country Club has won the\nU.l \u00bbU. Championship(and came fourth in the H^ de Park Road Relay).This really is a formidable list of wins. Never\nbefore has one college wen. all three\nmajor competitions.\nThe reasons for this series of\n\u2022victories: are not far to3 eek. The\nI.C. Sports Clubs are in fine shape,\nkeenness and ability in the first' teams\nand club spirit in the last teams all played th*ir part. The triumphs of any.\ncollege first team belong to the B3 XV\nthe 7th XI, and the fourth hockey team,\nin fact the whole club contributes to\nany first team victory. It gives me\ngreat pleasure to say:\nWELL DONE, I.C "

Those contented visitors to \" Sailor Beware\" who went home and slept\neasily with the knowledge that Albert and\nShirley got safely married as the curtain\ndropped have now been rudely awakened.\nEven at the end of Part II they have still not entered into the sacred state of wed-lock, but maybe a third instalment will change all this. As far as one can see,\nthe cast of \"Watch It Sailor\" is almost\nidentical to the one used by its predecessor,\nThe only major change is the substitution\nof Kathleen Harrison for Peggy Mount in the all important part of the frantically impossible Emma. Because of obvious physical difference, the character of Emma\nis greatly changed by this, but it is nevertheless quite a fine well balanced\nperformance.\n\"Fings Ain't Wot They Used T 'be\" has\nreceived amu oh rougher reception than\nmight have been expected by many people.\nThe truth is though that the play is rather\nbadly'thrown together' and it is only its rather endearing charm and easy good nature that makes it at all acceptable. It i3 also helped very much by Lionel Barts\nlively lyrics anu songs which will certainly stand a second hearing. Surely\nthe title song must have diffused into\nall lovers of peace by now.

JAZZ AT THE PHILHARMONIC This was one of the usual Grantz\npackage shows, presenting Ella Fitz gerald backed by Paul Smith, the Jimmy\nGuiffre trio, Roy Eldridge and the Paul\nSmith ul a art et, and Shelly Manne and his The programme commenced with Paul\nSmith piano, Roy Eldridge trumpet, Wilfred Middlebrooks bass, and Gus Johnson drums.\nThis group swung right from the start, with a moody interpretation of 'Bernies\nTune', with some superb muted trumpet\nfrom Eldridge. However, they didn't really warm up until the second number,\na12 bar up-tempo blues, with Johnson\ncompletely relaxed and combining well with Smith, (at times there seemed to be\na complete understanding) and Eldridge\nseemingly trying to reach the roof with\na fine aerobatic open trumpet.\nPaul Smith on piano was the most\nexciting sound I have heard since Garner,\nhis technique was fantastic. In one\nphrase he would be playing an immaculate\nclassical chord al progression, and in the\nnext few bars would switch to a swinging\njazz-3ty le phrase, interspersed with an\nunbelievable number of quotes. The\ngroup finished with an unannounced original. The Jimmy Guiffre Trio appeared\nnext consisting of Guiffe on clarinet and tenor sax;., Jim Hall guitar and\nMiddlebrooks bass. Guiffre's tone on\nboth instruments was very breathy, while\nthe balance of the whole group was\nexcellent. However, the total volume of the group was more suited for a night-club, and the sound of the group was\nrather lost in the hall. The trio commenced with 'Mac the Knife', went into 'My Funny Valentine', and finished up .\nwith a Guiffre original, 'Two for Timbucktoo' rather reminiscent of his, 'Train and the River'.\nShelly Manne and his Men featured\nMarine on drums, Russ Freeman on piano\nMonty Budwig bass, Joe Gordon trumpet,\nRichie Kamuca tenor saxophone. The\ngroup commenced with 'Taboo', and it was\nimmediately evident that Manne takes a long time to warm up to where he swings\nas much as he does on his records.\n'I 've grown accustomed to her Face',\nwas featured by 'The Friends' in which\nFreeman struck me as being much less impressive than on record. 'Vamps\nBlues', an original by Charlie Mariano,\nfinished the set.\nDid Manne's showmanship\ndetract from an appreciation of his\ndrumming? Personally speaking we don't think so, although you may disagree with us.

    "content": "FELIX\nSOCCER CUP FINAL IC HAVE TOO MUCH TOP BRASS FOR GOLDSMITHS \u2022 a x For the 3eo on d year in succession\nthe U.L. Association Football Challenge\nCup has returned to its rightful home at\nI.C. On Saturday, Feb. 27th. at Hotspur\nlark the I.C. XI retained the Cup with\na very close 2 - 1 win over Goldsmiths\nCollege. The path to the final, easy at\nfirst but very difficult later has al ready been lavishly described in earlier F el ici but having disposed of L.S.E. and U.C. the I.C. team went into the\nfinal firm favourites to win the Cup.\nGoldsmiths, possibly as a result of sound\nadvice by Jimmy Clarkson, were determined\nnot to let us get away with it so easily\nand were out to knock us off our game by\nfierce tackling and tight marking.\nHowever, like all good story tellers we will start at the beginning with the\nrash of horr if io ally coloured posters\nand loudspeaker announcements which\nheralded the final match. The attractions of an afternoon listening to the\nI.C. Traditional Jazz Band plus an uninterrupted view of Jezebel plus an hour\nand a half of scintillating football played by tech nicol our teams, plus the\nopportunity to get themselves filmed by\nthe I.C. Soccer Club cine camera was\nobviously too much for about four score\nand ten vociferous supporters who travelled to the wilds of Motspur territory to witness the great battle and cheer on\ntheir own champions. The Goldsmiths army\nwas even str one er numerically but having\nfewer bass voices and many more contraltos a new 1st law of sound became\napparent i.e.: volume is inversely proportional to numbers.\nThe teams changed with the music\nof that pleasant old English folk song\n\"Why are we waiting\" ringing in their\nears and eventually marched out to a thunderous ovation. Both sides were then ^\npresented to the Warden of the U.L. Union\nMr. D.J. Warden M. C.,M.A. and the Officers\nof the U.L. A.F.C. Soon after the Rational Anthem Goldsmiths kicked off with what little wind\nthere was and the sun against them. The\ngame was swinging rapidly from end to end\nin the first ten minutes but with the I.C. attacks having more penetration. Max\nFinney went close with a couple of runs\nonly to put his shots into the side netting while Dave io well was a constant\ndanger on the Goldsmith1\ns right wing.\nHowever, 3as>. James was playing his usual\nsolid game in the middle, and alt ough\nGoldsmiths told their big centre forward\nto bustle him into mistakes, no danger\ncame from this quarter. She I.C. team\ngenerally were a little on edge and not\nplaying with the smooth rhythm of former\ngame3. Goldsmiths took advantage of\nthis in their pj.an of campaign and tackled very quickly so as to prevent us from\nplaying the match-winning football v<h ich brought I.C. into the final. After\nseveral I.C. attacks, a long ball down\nthe middle left the Goldsmith's forward\nwith a clear run in and shot, but he\nveered away to the right and gave Steve\nPick the chance to cover and make a good\ntackle to save the situation. Just\nafter this came the first big thrill of\nthe match, when a Finney header with\n'goal' written all over it was handled\nover the bar by a Goldsmith defender\nJames came up to take the penalty kick,\nand amidst a great hush hit the ball hard\nand fast two feet outside the past.\nAfter this let off Goldsmiths played\nharder than ever, cheered on by their\nenthusiastic supporters, who were\ninevitably drowned by the organised\ncheering of the I.C. contingent. So the\ngame continued at ding-dong pace until half time, when I.C. went into the\ndressing-room a much chastened team to\nfind the score still00, instead of the\n3-0 lead which had been expected.\nThe half time pep-talk perhaps had\nsome effect, because not long after the\nrestart Dave Coups banged in a good old-fashioned shot that really made the net\nbulge.\nMore pressure by I.C. led to another\ngoal from Dave Coups at centre-forward,\nfollowing some good grafting by the\nforward line, and Colin Harris was very\nunlucky with a carefully aimed full blooded volley, which went just outside\nthe post.\nSoon after this I.C. was awarded yet\nanother penalty, and penalty-king Max\nFinney trotted up to take the kick.\nWith a deceptive run-up he sent the goal\nkeeper and ail the photographers going\nthe wrong way, and cunningly slipped the\nball just outside the other goalpost,\nlet another penalty miss, but now I.C. was two goals up, and ready to score some\nmore.\nHowever, Goldsmiths was not finished\nand fought back fiercely with Dave\nNewin bringing the ball through from\nright-half and Dave lowell their right-winger turning up on the left wing and\nat centre-forward and anywhere else\nwhere the ball happened to be.\nThis perseverance paid off soon when\nlowell from the centre-forward\nposition lofted the ball over the\ncrowded I.C. defence into the back of\nthe net. I.C. at this time were overconfident and held the ball too long\ninstead of beating the quick tackling\nGoldsmith's defence, by push-and-run\nf:.ot ball. After forcing a corner which was\nquickly cleared the Goldsmith side seemed\nto have shot their bolts, and I.C. pounded\non to a hard earned and solid, if not very\nbrilliant win. having collected the Cup\nand medals from Mr Warden, the jubilant\nteam rushed off to crack a bottle of\nchampagne in the dressing room before\nproceeding to the real celebration of the\nevening. The bar, the concert hall, the\nhostel, and a certain place in Hammersmith\nW.6. noticed a certain joyfulness among\nthe soccer club during the evening and\nthe new German boot and the Cup circulated\nfuriously in the bar. Several people\nactually went to bed, but at least two\npersons managed to last out until11.30 the following morning. So the celebrations finish for this year, and now we look\nforward to equal efforts and equal\nsuccess next year.\nROWING Friday, February 27th. saw the\nfirst and second VTII's setting off on\na high tide for Staines although their\nimmediate destination was only the\nLensbury Club, 11 miles 'upstream. At\nthis stage the 2nd. VXII, who had been\nvery unsettled by changes in the crew,\nwere very unsure of themselves and were\ncompletely unable to compete with the\n1st. VIII in speed. Consequently they\nmade their own way to Lensbury staying\nwell up in front of the other crew who\nwere re ce iii inga lot of coaching from\nthe launch.\nMeeting on Saturday again at Lensbury\nthe crews set off into a stiff headwind\nand a very fast stream running down making\nprogress very hard work. The two VTIIs\ndid not see much of each other before\nlunch at Walton but the lower boat was\nimproving even then. After lunch the\ntwo crews met on level terms for the\nfirst time and the 2nd VIII were able\nto hold the first VIII over as tre to h of half a mile travelling at the same\nrate, something which seemed impossible\neven two days earlier. Late that\nafternoon great fun was had by this crew\nfor they were swept onto the bank three\ntimes while negotiating the sharp upr iver bends, hit several overhanging trees\nand eventually slid to a gentle stop on a submerged grassy bank, afterwards floating off leaving bowman, Mike Craig, standing\nfor lc ly up to his knees in water. However, these things over, the crew got together much better and just before Staines\nwas paddling nicely ahead of the 1st VIII\nand two Staines crews without too much\neffort.\nComing back on o un day both crews were\npaddling better and rowing with the stream\nmade life very much easier. Lunch at\nWalton and tea at Richmond left the crews\nin fine form for the Head course. The\n1st VTII paddling at 25-26 did the fast\ntime of 19 mins. 30 sees, but the 2nd VIII who had as tart of 30 seconds rowed over\nin 19 mins. 15 sec3. much to their satisfaction. Both crews are rowing in the Reading\nHead of the River this Saturday to get ner with the 3rd VTII over a two and a half\nmile course and hopes of a good performance\nare running high.\nCongratulations to the \u201eoc key Club\non completing the Triple for us. Now\nwe have the Dinner to look forward to,\nassuming that Union finances can take it. D.F. "
