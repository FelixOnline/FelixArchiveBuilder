Prehistoric in ap-pearance, these giant brutes were many\ntimes bigger than any tortoises I had\never previously seen. Quirks of nature\nsuch as a lagoon that turns pink for half\nthe year were fascinating and another\nhighlight of our trip was horseback riding up to a recently erupted volcano\u2019s\ncrater.

Rich in history, scen-ery, wildlife and culture, the \u2018enchanted\nislands\u2019 are a popular tourist destination and a must-see for any traveller to\nSouth America with a few days to spare.\nThey are, perhaps, best known for two\nreasons. Firstly, the many endemic spe-cies, most notable of all- the Gal\u00e1pagos\nTortoise. The second reason, related to\nthe first, is the role the islands\u2019 wildlife\nplayed in the development of Charles\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution.\nStrachan Mackenzie (also known as\n\u2018slow Strachan\u2019 or the \u2018lesser-spotted,\ndim-witted Strachan\u2019), whom you may\nremember from the guinea pig article\nin this section two weeks ago, accompanied me to these islands earlier this\nyear.

Instead\nit is a hastily written ramble about journeys that I could be bothered to make,\nto areas that are not in themselves special or interesting. Think of it, if you\nwill, as the kind of long message you\nwould happen about on Facebook, dismiss immediately, and forget about.\nThis week I would like to take you\nback in time. This is regrettably beyond my powers, so I will take you- if\nI may- to Chingford. Nestled between\nEpping Forest and areas without for-est, it is not easily accessible by tube\nbut boasts higher than average levels\nof chavs and squirrels- not necessarily\nin that order.\nDuring the notorious \u201cnuts riots\u201d\nof the late 1980\u2019s, it rose to top of the\nnews agenda on BBC London North as\nthe deaths of over 230 common grey\nsquirrels and 47 chavs where recorded,\nwhen stores of acorns and shoddily\nwritten magazines were mistakenly\ndestroyed to make way for, what many\nsaid was a somewhat premature, Diana\nmemorial.\nIt is not widely known that the former\nConservative leader Iain Duncan Smith\nMP works tirelessly for Chingford- indeed it is more widely known and generally accepted that he does not. Despite this, you will be pleased to know\nthat Chingford has recently undergone\nsomething of a renaissance. Street caf\u00e9\nculture is now chic. On a summer\u2019s\nday, many tattooed gentlemen and less\ngentle-women may be found sipping\nalcopops outside any number of bistros and bars. For example, the newly\nopened \u201cBarBistro\u201d caters for most of\nthe needs of the local clientele.\nBisecting Chingford runs the Greenwich Meridian Line, marked by a striking granite obelisk. Unfortunately, due\nto general incompetence, the obelisk\nwas positioned a depressing 5 metres\naway from the actual meridian and\nthus a slab of graffiti-covered concrete\nnow informs local doggers of its exact\nposition.\nIf you want more proof of the significance of Chingford, simply haul your\ngreat heaving mass over to a library\ncomputer and look at David Beckham\u2019s\n\u00a9 page on Wikipedia and (if I have edited Wikipedia in time) you will see that\nit was on the playing fields of Ridgeway Park in Chingford that he trained\nfor many of his formative years. He\nwas also educated at Chingford High\nSchool, but let\u2019s not hold that against\nChingford.\n\u201cBut what is at the heart of Chingford?\u201d I hear you whine, \u201cWhy do you\ncare about Chingford?\u201d -others moan.\nThe truth of the matter is that Chingford is not really an unintelligent rabble of humanity but more of an old\nfriend, a friend who you suspect killed\nyour cat when you were 8, but who you\ndecide you go with a drink with none\nthe less because you never really liked\nyour cat anyway.\nTravels\nwithout\nmy aunt\nTheo Georgiou-Delisle\nFinches: Darwin\u2019s inspiration\nto Gal\u00e1pagos access by air.\nOne of the particularly rave reviews\nwe had came from a strange Canadian\nfellow who we met in our hostel. His\nstory is worth relating even though it\nhas nothing to do with our jaunt to the\nislands. The Canadian\u2019s brother had\nbeen living in Quito for a number of\nyears and had managed to get a local\ngirl, whom he had been briefly seeing,\npregnant. Woe was him. He decided to\ndo the \u2018honourable thing\u2019 and marry\nthe girl. As the wedding approached\nhis doubts intensified. Things reached\na head when the father of the bride\ntold him he would have to provide not\nonly for the wife but also for the rest\nof the, extremely large, extended fam-ily! The day before the wedding, disillusioned and anxious, he went out and\ngot \u2018wasted\u2019 on what sounded like an\nepic bender in the streets of Ecuador\u2019s\ncapital. In the process he was arrested\nand spent the night in a South American jail (not a nice place to be, appar-ently). So the wedding was called off\nfor the time being. Instead of comforting his ill-fated brother or trying to\nsort the situation out, the groom-tobe\u2019s brother, whom we were speaking\nto, decided to immediately rent a car\nand depart on a road trip around Ecuador. It sounded like the setting to a\nbad American teen movie, but it was in\nfact the truth. Either way his insensitive decision benefited us as it inspired\nus to make our own impromptu trip to\nthe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nThere are two ways of experiencing the islands, and both involve boat\ntravel, but to varying degrees. It is possible (for an extra $1000) to sleep on a\nboat which travels between the islands\nat night, but we opted for the more\nmodestly priced two-island tour which\ninvolves staying on the islands them-selves. This did mean we did not, real-ly, get to see the full diversity of Galapgos wildlife. This was rather irritating\nsince it was while observing differences in the various species (especially\nmal population of perhaps a thousand\npeople at most, so we were surprised to\nfind bustling town centres and a population of 30,000. The islands\u2019 culture\nwas incredibly laid-back. Nowhere in\nSouth America do things run on time,\nbut this was especially true on these\nislands. People were very friendly and\nthere was great community spirit and\npride.\nThere are, of course, downsides to\nhaving a human population on the is-lands- the environment and resources\nare constantly under strain. The other\nproblem is the tourists- not all the\ntourists, many of whom are very pleas-ant. The problem lies with the hordes\nof American school kids infesting the\nhotels and generally causing all sorts\nof consternation to the soundtrack of\nHigh School: The Musical.\nWe only spent five days on the islands\nbut it was worth every penny and if you\ncan stretch yourself to afford it, it\u2019s an\nunforgettable experience. There is a\n\u2018student\u2019 Gal\u00e1pagos near the south of\nEcuador, which is cheaper. This island\nhas none of the history and culture\nof the real Gal\u00e1pagos and only some\nof the wildlife, but is an option of the\ntraveller on a shoe-string budget.\n\n"

In total, Council has gained\neight more members whilst the Trustee Board has added one more to its\ncommittee.\nBefore voting had even begun, it was\nknown that there would be vacancies\non Council. Some positions were not\neven contested; postgraduate representation was especially dismal with\nonly one PhD student running.\nThe majority of the results were announced in dB\u2019s last Friday at lunch-time, to an audience of approximately\nsix people as well as the handful of students who just happened to be sinking\ntheir teeth into a bite to eat. Unsurprisingly the student body didn\u2019t flock in\ndroves to be a part of the nail-biting\nclimax to a month\u2019s worth of non-ex-istent campaigning. The lack of candidates waiting to hear their fate, how-ever, was more worrying and begs the\nquestion: did those students even care\nwhether they won a place on Council\nor not? Either that or the Union has\ndone an incredibly lousy job of emailing people to tell them when the results\nwere going to be released. Nevertheless, the committee has gained a handful of new members who will hopefully\nbring some much needed debate to the\nmonthly meetings.\nA flattering two thousand votes\nwere cast individually, but overall the\nturnout was low with the most successful candidate receiving 74 votes. A\nbreakdown of the results can be found\nelsewhere on the page. There were a\nfew surprises in the Undergraduate\nEngineering Councillor and the Trustee Board categories where this year\u2019s\nRON representative, RON Weasley,\nmanaged to vanquish three foes with\nhis magic wand. These positions will\nbe recontested at the next Council\nmeeting along with the other outstanding places. A by-election will be\nrun, whereby people will turn up to the\nCouncil meeting and put themselves\nforward to be on the committee.\nIf you were completely unaware the\nelection had even happened and you\nhave a burning desire to be on Council or the Trustee Board, come along\nto the next meeting in the Union Dining Hall on Monday 10th December at\n6:30pm. There were some rather tasty\npastries at the last meeting so what\nhave you got to lose?\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nA plethora of Council candidates eagerly await the results\nThe winners were...\n(number of votes in brackets)\nTrustee Board\nAli Al-Hussaini (190)\nRON (124)\nUG Medicine\nAlexander Walls (74)\nMark Chamberlain (41)\nOlivia Kenyon (39)\nUG Engineering\nJohn James (34)\nJohn James (18)\nRON (11)\nPG Engineering\nAshley Brown (16)\nUG Natural Sciences\nShray Amar (49)\nJose Videira (27)\nHalt the Beit redevelopment\nproject or run the gauntlet?\nOnce again, Beit was the main point of\ndiscussion at the most recent meeting\nof the Executive (Exec) committee. The\nUnion is in somewhat of a quandary;\nwhether or not to go ahead with the\nsecond phase of the Beit Masterplan.\nThe Masterplan is the long-term\nredevelopment plan to update Beit\u2019s\nfacilities. The first phase was completed last academic year when daVinci\u2019s was refurbished and a lift was\ninstalled in the Union\u2019s main entrance.\nSeveral weeks ago Felix reported on\nthe revelation that funding for the first\nphase came from the Union\u2019s General\nReserve, a very large pot of money intended for use in the event of a catas-trophe. The money for Phase 1 should\nnever have been authorised to come\nfrom this reserve in the first place.\nNow however, the Union is debating\nwhether to deplete the General Reserve\neven more in order to fund the second\nphase of the Masterplan which will see\na massive redesign of the Union offices\nincluding a sparkling new Student Activities Centre, to replace the existing\none in the East Basement of Beit Quad\nas well as a new gymnasium and activity space on the third floor.\nCollege has said that it is happy to\ngive over \u00a31.4m to fund the second\nphase, however the Union needs to\nstump up the rest of the cash: around\n\u00a31.7m. In a report to Exec, the Union\nPresident Stephen Brown wrote that\n\u201cwe are confident \u2026 that Union Reserves could be used to fund \u00a31.2m of\nour share\u201d.\nIf the full amount is used, the Union\nwould be left with a severely compromised General Reserve. Even then,\nthe Union is \u00a3500k short of the total\namount it needs to raise. Mr Brown\ncontinued by stating that the difference would have to be made up over a\nperiod of 19 months using \u201cother revenue streams within the Union\u201d such\nas trading and entertainment. The\n\u00a31.2m figure is not set in stone how-ever. For instance, it was suggested at\nExec that a smaller proportion of the\nReserve could be taken meaning even\nmore money would need to be generated from other revenue streams.\nEither way, if a decision to go ahead\nwith the redevelopment is taken, the\nUnion may be forced to call upon College for help should it encounter financial difficulty further down the line,\nsomething that many fear may compromise ICU\u2019s independence from IC.\nThere are also further complications\ninvolving building interest rates that\nhave increased the cost by roughly 10 \u2013\n15% since the initial plans were drawn\nup two years ago. The Presidents will\nhave to dig even deeper down the\nbacks of their sofas.\nThe general response from Executive\ncommittee members and observers at\nthe meeting was one of caution, that\nthe Union should tread carefully and\nnot rush into a decision.\nAnd, finally, what about the third and\nfinal phase of the Masterplan \u2013 the redevelopment of dB\u2019s? Just don\u2019t ask.\nWhat do you think? Should the\nUnion go ahead with the second\nphase or should it save its pen-nies? Email comment.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk or text 07980 148 785\nIs it the end of the line for the Beit\nredevelopment?\n\n"

A slickly edited real\ntime drama with three loosely related\nthreads spanning the globe, it sounds\nlike an episode of 24 but with the issues at hand discussed through theatrical dialogue, not the messianic Jack\nBauer. Add the heavyweight cast of\nMeryl Streep, Robert Redford and Tom\nCruise to serve as conduits for a sharp\nbattle of wits over the \u201cWar on Terror\u201d\nand political punch is assured, yet Lions never reaches a fulfilling roar.\nWhilst not a simple exercise in flag-waving, Lions seems very much like an\nAmerican product aimed at an American audience, probing the effect of\na foreign war on home soil. Redford\nplays a professor trying to inspire a disillusioned student to overcome his political apathy whilst Streep and Cruise\nface off as a journalist and smooth\ntalking senator discussing a new attack strategy in Afghanistan. The plan\nof attack itself becomes the third story,\nas two young soldiers struggle to stay\nalive fighting for a country that, hither-to, hasn\u2019t treated them with the respect\nthey deserve.\nThe effect of the Vietnam War was\nonly visible as an aftershock for cine-ma, with the subject matter it provided\nonly finding its way into film years\nafter the conflict itself was over. Critics said it came too late, and now, six\nyears since the \u201cWar on Terror\u201d was\ndeclared, come its effects on screen.\nWith the ending still unbeknownst to\nus, the direction to take seems an odd\none. The routes of condemnation versus absolution intertwine without an\nend point to measure the justification\nof the means, and leave Lions posing a\nlot of questions it can\u2019t answer.\nThat said, many of the points raised\nin Lions resonate beyond a purely cinematic experience. \u201cDo you want to\nwin the war on terror?\u201d asks Cruise\u2019s\nsenator, enlisting a dubious response\nthat belies the simplistic yes-no answer\nhe wants. Redford\u2019s strand analyses the\nmiddle-class youth\u2019s reaction to war,\na very different one to the activism of\nRobert Redford\u2019s political debate gives plenty of material for discussion but ends in an overblown dead-heat\nstudents in the Sixties and exposes a sit-back mentality that prevents change,\nyet without exploring the reasons for\nsuch lethargy. Streep, meanwhile, is the\nvoice of media ethics, one of many who\nin the post-9/11 shellshock supported\nthis war which hindsight seems to view\nso abhorrently. To what extent did the\nsaturated sensationalist reports fed to\na broken country fuel its thirst for re-venge? And in Afghanistan, why is it\nthat young people on the edge of society fight for a country that has not given them their dues, whilst the spoiled\nbourgeoisie sit back and criticise?\nThese ideas are conveyed with the\nsubtlety of Paul Haggis\u2019 Crash, the\nsame subtlety America is renowned\nfor. The hidden meaning here is about\nas covered up as Britney Spears stumbling into a taxi, yet the impact is not\nsignificantly lessened for it. All three\nactors are finely equipped to deal with\ntheir parts, yet no-one seems to get\nstretched at any point. Dialogue replaces dramatics and despite Cruise\ngetting crazier by the day, he can still\npull off great performances, and this\none, oddly reminiscent of his superior\nturn in Magnolia, stands well against\nthe other two Goliaths.\nThe philosophy of Lions is its strongest tick box though and, with Redford\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nGETTING\nYOUR\nFUTURE\u2019S\nCLOSER.\njpmorgan.com/careers\nJPMorgan is a marketing name of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries worldwide. \u00a92007 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Ring ring!\nD\nramSoc\u2019s opening play of\nthe year is the late Frederick Knott\u2019s murder\nmystery thriller, \u201cDial M\nfor Murder\u201d, directed by\nFran Buckland. This was brought to us\nin its original flavour with no modernisation or any fantasy costumes.\nWe are sat in front of a London flat\nin the 50s, where resident Tony \u2013 a\nformer British tennis player \u2013 uses his\nold colleague, Lesgate, to plot the \u201cperfect murder\u201d against his loaded wife,\nSheila, whom he knows is having an\naffair with Max, a crime story writer.\nHowever, with Inspector Hubbard\u2019s\nsharp detection and Max\u2019s clever de-ciphering, Tony\u2019s supposedly complicated plan starts to collapse.\nBeing a freshers\u2019 play, it is no surprise\nto see unfamiliar faces in the cast list of\nsix. However, it did not take long for\nme to start liking them. It was obvious that George Koulouris, who plays\nTony, has a fair amount of acting expe-rience: he was able maintain the same\ncharacter throughout the play, and the\nposh British accent he put on should\nalso be credited \u2013 it somehow charmed\nthe audience. However, because of his\nconsistency, he had already revealed\nhis evil side right from the beginning.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though: George is\na great actor, but it\u2019s just that I\u2019d like\nto see more of a double-character for a\ngreater suspension at the beginning.\nDavid Stacey\u2019s brainy Max was also\none of my favourites. With his intellectual lines right from the start, and\na slight desperation for Sheila, there\nis no reason to blame Sheila for liking\nthis man. David\u2019s lively character was\nalso what kept the audience focused\nand excited. I really look forward to see\nhim in a comedy someday.\nWhile Sheila and Max were out, Tony\nsummoned Joscha Diehl\u2019s Lesgate for a\ncar trade, but in fact he just wanted to\nblackmail Lesgate to commit a murder.\nLesgate was a perfect, stone-cold (al-though unsuccessful) assassin, but perhaps a bit shy. I also struggled to hear\nhis words in his meeting with Tony.\nAgain, like Tony\u2019s character, he could\nuse some more flexibility to reflect his\ncunningness, but this is really not bad\nfor a virgin actor \u2013 I see great potential.\nIt will be good to see how far he goes in\nthe next production.\nSheila, played by Nada Jumabhoy,\nwas slightly disappointing. I remember\ndeeply that in her conversation with\nMax at the beginning, it sounded as\nif she was just reading her lines. What\nput me off later was how she reacted\nafter the attempted murder: nothing.\nThere was no sign of guilt on her face,\nafter she reversed the killing and let\nLesgate\u2019s bloody body lie on the floor.\nShe was not even close to crying. It just\ndidn\u2019t feel natural at all. A more thorough preparation and direction would\nhave eliminated this.\nIn the second half of the show, Inspector Hubbard, played by the charming Gilead Amit, turned up in Tony\u2019s\nflat. I was impressed by his professionalism as an inspector on stage, doing\nall the right things that a real inspector\nwould do, even down to the tiniest de-tails. And slightly off-topic: if I had not\nread about him in the cast list, I would\nStanzas for Students (who do science degrees)\nDramatic, terrible and my favourite. Good old Tennyson shows us how it\u2019s done with the Charge of the\nLight Brigade. I want to see you all reading this a lot around campus in your best theatrical voices!\nThis famous charge took place during\nthe battle of Balaklava, 25th October\n1854. Under mistaken orders - \u2018Some\none had blunder\u2019d\u2019 - the Earl of Cardigan, with his Light Brigade of 607\nhorsemen, rode up a valley, manned\nin front and on both flanks by Russian\nguns and masses of Russian soldiers,\nOf the 607 troopers, 409 fell and only\n198 escaped. A bloody massacre, re-ally. Here endeth the lesson. That\u2019s all\nfor this week, kiddies.\nHalf a league, half a league,\nHalf a league onward,\nAll in the valley of Death\nRode the six hundred.\n\u2018Forward, the Light Brigade!\n\u2018Charge for the guns!\u2019 he said:\nInto the valley of Death\nRode the six hundred.\n\u2018Forward, the Light Brigade!\u2019\nWas there a man dismay\u2019d?\nNot tho\u2019 the soldier knew\nSome one had blunder\u2019d:\nTheir\u2019s not to make reply,\nTheir;s not to reason why,\nTheir\u2019s but to do and die:\nInto the valley of Death\nRode the six hundred.\nCannon to right of them,\nCannon to left of them,\nCannon in front of them\nVolley\u2019d and thunder\u2019d;\nStorm\u2019d at with shot and shell,\nBoldly they rode and well,\nInto the jaws of Death,\nInto the mouth of Hell\nRode the six hundred.\nFlash\u2019d all their sabres bare,\nFlash\u2019d as they turn\u2019d in air,\nSabring the gunners there,\nCharging an army, while\nAll the world wonder\u2019d:\nPlunged in the battery-smoke\nRight thro\u2019 the line they broke;\nCossack and Russian\nReel\u2019d from the sabre-stroke\nShatter\u2019d and sunder\u2019d.\nThen they rode back, but not\nNot the six hundred.\nCannon to the right of them,\nCannon to the left of them,\nCannon behind them\nVoley\u2019d and thunder\u2019d;\nStorm\u2019d at with shot and shell,\nWhile horse and hero fell,\nThey that had fought so well\nCame thro\u2019 the jaws of Death\nBack from the mouth of Hell,\nAll that was them of them,\nLeft of six hundred.\nWhe can their glory fade?\nO the wild charge they made!\nAll the world wonder\u2019d.\nHonour the charge they made!\nHonour the Light Brigade,\nNoble six Hundred!\nhave thought he was English rather\nthan \u201cSwitzeraeli\u201d!\nA comedy moment arrived when\nMax turned up alone in front of Tony,\nexcitedly spelling out his \u201cown\u201d story\nthat coincidentally matched the truth,\nhoping that Tony would give this to the\npolice, which might rescue Sheila from\nher death sentence, although having to\nputhimselfintoprison.Ofcourse,Tony\nhad no interest in saving Shelia anyway and shooed Max away with slight\npanic, but luckily Hubbard\u2019s mind was\non the same frequency as Max\u2019s, so the\ntwo teamed up (not intentionally) and\neventually caught Tony red-handed.\nLast but not least, we have the legendary Sir Walter Plinge\u2019s Williams,\nwhose manly voice could be heard\nfrom the back when responding Hubbard, but his body never appeared on\nstage. The reason? It will remain a\nmystery.\nOverall, it is an excellent production with a great stage set-up and some\ngreat performances, perfect for a light\nevening. Technically there were no\nmajor flaws either, so well done to the\nbackstage crew. If you missed out on\nthis production, have no fear: hopefully DramSoc\u2019s next production will\nshow their real capability with the rest\nof their veteran members.\nAlways a good evening\u2019s enter-tainment! Dramsoc\u2019s next play is\n\u2018Translations\u2019 and runs from 28th\nNovember to 1st December.\n15\nUh oh... like somebody call the cops\n\u201can excellent\nproduction with\nsome great\nperformances\u201d\n\n"

Half-Life was\nan awesome game when it came out,\nas was the second iteration. However,\nit\u2019 all too obvious that the whole episodic content concept is leading to an\nincreasingly shallower pool of quality.\nValve messed around a little bit too\nmuch with their anticipated Episode\nTwo and are now suffering burns from\nthe acid tongue of the one and only\nAngry Geek.\nThat\u2019s an example of a rather large\n(and quite famous) development studio messing up \u2013 poor form really. In\nthat sense it\u2019s quite harsh to launch\ninto tirades against games created by\nsmaller teams or even the solitary yet\npassionate code monkey. The thing is,\nthese games \u2013 often no more than experiments \u2013 are usually of higher quality than those with literally million-dollar budgets. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more\nembarrassing for Episode Two since it\nfaces off against a set of games that individually rival the very tenets that the\nseries holds dear.\nWe have a game that utilises an Artificial Intelligence system that\u2019s often\neerie in the way it brings characters\nto life. Their dialogue naturally adapts\nto your responses and you may well\nspend more than a few uncomfortable\nmoments wondering if you\u2019re actually\nplaying alone. Half-Life 2 may have realised Alyx through nuanced anima-tion, but for a Flash-based game to\nevoke similar human emotions is quite\nastounding.\nIn 2004, Valve awed the gaming community by actually offering a physics\nengine that was robust and actually\nconsequential to your gameplay expe-rience. The Gravity Gun has definitely\ntaken its place in the annals of gaming\nhistory alongisde the chainsaw and assault rifle. However, one game dares to\ntry better. It involves a yellow little ar-madillo, lots of empty white space and\nsimply your imagination. Adhering to\nthe laws of physics you need to help\nmanipulate various objects to lead the\nlittle critter to safety. The game plays\nlike the natural progression of the likes\nof \u201cThe Incredible Machine\u201d \u2013 and we\nall know how prescient that game was.\nDespite being a very indie game, Armadillo Run has rightfully been lathered in universal plaudit.\nLastly, we see what can only be the\nclosest thing to pen-and-paper Dungeons-and-Dragons; bloom lighting\nneed not apply. With graphics easily\nsurpassed by a 5-year old using MSPaint whilst trying to swat a fly on\nthe monitor with the mouse cursor,\nthe Dwarf game (I refused to type the\nwhoe name again) will send RPG aficionados into a Frenzy +2 while everyone else (about 99% of us) goes back to\nrunning amuck in Oblivion.\nThis\nWeek\nOne-eighth the dosage\nThe future of WoW? Can you end the fa\u00e7ade?\nThe Battle of the Geeks Run little Armadillo, run\nThe Angry Geek does what he does best after getting run over by Episode Two\nT\nhe problem with celebrated developers is that they\nget fat. Fat and compla-cent. They get so close\nto their work that each\nindividual, minuscule change seems\nto them to be a world-altering master-piece. And this is where Valve manage\nto take a work of considerable merit \u2013\nHalf-Life 2 \u2013 and put it into a blender\nwith a collection of the finest animal\nexcrement. Half-Life 2, Episode Two, is\ndepressingly bad.\nYou see, Episode Two had to do a lot\n\u2013 it not only had to show that Valve\ncould still do what they were made famous for doing, but it had to work from\na lacklustre Episode One and build on\nit to create something approaching\nsuspense for the grand finale of Episode Three.\nYeah, right.\nThere are some nice moments in Episode Two, and I\u2019m going to list them all\nfor you, right now: finding the crowbar.\nThe room with the larvae in. D0g\u2019s re-appearance. That\u2019s it. Episode Two has\nsome fun moments in it, but that\u2019s all I\ntook away from it as worth mentioning\nto others.\nWhereas Episode One\u2019s problem was\na combination of length and necessary\nexposition, Episode Two\u2019s problem is\ngameplay. The thing is broken, and it\u2019s\nbroken very badly. Episode One was\nalright for people like me \u2013 a fair deal\nof momentum once you\u2019d left the Citadel, some nice urban bits, and a sense\nof chase. Episode Two, by contrast, has\nno momentum whatsoever.\nAnd where Episode One cherryp-icked things that genuinely worked in\nHalf-Life 2 \u2013 things like actual co-op-eration with AI characters (c.f. running\nthrough the station in the dark with\nAlyx) and the feeling of being in a real\nrebellion (that is to say, NOT like the\nridiculously sparse Sand Trap chapter\nin the original) \u2013 Episode Two seems\nhell bent on choosing the very worst\nthings and cramming them together.\nFirstly \u2013 no-one can make underground caverns interesting. They\u2019re\nsquelchy tubes. Everything looks the\nsame, and it\u2019s dark. It\u2019s the setting for\nthe most boring of all game events, and\nnot even Valve could save it. The designers\u2019 obvious fixation with the beautiful larva-catching moment ended up\nforcing the player to drag through an\nhour of mindless, samey crap, replete\nwith the most backwards boss fight in\nall of gaming. Not good. At all.\nThen we emerge, having healed the\nuseless woman that\u2019s taken the place of\nfeisty, helpful, Episode One Alyx, into\nGeneric Forestland where the \u2018supporting\u2019 characters proceed to give\nevery inane task to Gordon. You can\nhave characters joke about repetitive\ndesign precisely once, Valve. Doing it\nevery time makes me want to punch\nsomeone. And for god\u2019s sake \u2013 the\nseesaw bridge? It\u2019s not even a physics\npuzzle \u2013 I knocked three cars off and\nthe thing didn\u2019t move an inch. Then I\nmove the final car and I\u2019m catapaulted\nacross the asphalt like a gnome from a\nmissile silo.\nDeep breaths. Calm blue ocean. Yes.\nThen we have the car section.\nLet me make one thing abundantly\nclear \u2013 I hate the car sections in HalfLife. The only things I hate more than\ncar sections, are car sections with Alyx\nquipping alongside me. It handles ap-pallingly, and the only way of getting it\nunstuck is to use the gravity gun, which\ntakes a year and a day.\nAnd everything just begins to break\ndown then \u2013 there are resistance\ncorpses quite literally everywhere. I\nsaw more dead resistance members\nthan I did Combine troops in Episode\nTwo, which makes me really begin to\nquestion how effective these chaps are\nat fighting a rebellion. Not that it took\nlong to find a solution, of course, as I\nstopped in at the Last Chance Garage\nto get my car fixed up only to find myself being thrown out onto another\nsuicide mission while someone has sex\nwith Alyx for me. Yeah, cheers guys. I\u2019ll\nleave the six-man armed squad inside\nto pimp my ride while I crawl through\nzombie parts to take out a platoon of\nCombine soldiers. Fantastic.\nIt just gets worse. D0g appears, only\nto do one cool thing and then fuck off\ninto obscurity again, and then we go\ninto Very Boring Exposition. This has\nbecome Valve\u2019s trademark. I initially\nloved VBE, until they began using it\nall the sodding time. VBE is different\nfrom normal exposition, because you\ntend to be locked in a room and unable\nto escape from it. You can run away,\nof course \u2013 meaning you miss most of\nwhat\u2019s going on \u2013 and no-one gives a\ntoss. But you\u2019re never allowed to, you\nknow, just get on with things.\nBut that\u2019s okay, because there\u2019s a\ncracking finale set up. Oh boy. I can\u2019t\nwait. It\u2019s gonna be great. Here we go.\nIf you asked me to name the three\nhonest-to-christ awful parts of HalfLife 2, the list would go like this:\n1. The car sections.\n2. The defence bit in Nova Prospekt\nwith the ridiculous guns.\n3. Any puzzle involving projectiles.\nNow, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m entirely\nalone in this, but even so I find it\nhard to believe that Valve managed to\nchoose all three of these and combine\nthem into one set-piece. It\u2019s impres-sive. The idea of driving around in the\nvehicular equivalent of those rubber\nbouncy balls you buy in toy shops, firing pea-sized marbles at a ten-pixel-wide square that\u2019s four hundred feet\naway, and having to do this whilst under heavy fire and within a time limit,\nwhilst the world\u2019s most inefficient resistance fighters gawp at you, is just so\nunappealing. I mean, how did this even\nget as far as playtesting. Really.\nNaturally, it\u2019s impossible to die because you\u2019ve having medkits rammed\nup your arse everywhere you go, but by\nChrist the thing just never ends. Pick\nup ball. Put ball on car. Drive to Strider.\nAttempt to kill Hunters. Pick up ball\nonly to find there\u2019s one you\u2019ve missed,\nor other hunters have appeared from\nelsewhere, or you\u2019re not actually that\nproficient at a skill you learned four\nminutes ago. Drive back to ridiculous\nbuildings full of supplies. Repeat.\nJesus. Christ. This isn\u2019t even approaching epic. Even the \u2018open\u2019 environment seemed horribly manufactured to provide obstacles. It smacks of\nthat ridiculous minigame in Final Fantasy VII, but even Square didn\u2019t have\nthe gall to put it as part of the main\ngame. I mean, fuck me. Fourteen strid-ers? Fourteen of the shits? Was that\nreally the number required to provide\nenough of an experience?\nAnd then to top it all off, we get the\nmost rushed plot twist I\u2019ve ever seen,\ninvolving a character I really could\ncare less about. In fact, apart from D0g\nI don\u2019t really care about any of them\nany more. The minor humans are far\nmore appealing to me, as are the Vortigaunts. And to me, that says that Valve\nare beginning to falter.\nI think that\u2019s enough. There are\ngraphical glitches, poor event trig-gers, level design slips here or there,\nbut nothing to top the massive, dick-shaped ideas that litter what should\u2019ve\nbeen a new flavour of Half-Life. Episode Three had better be fucking awe-some. But given there was no trailer at\nthe end of this incarnation, I can only\nassume we\u2019ll be waiting some time to\nfind out.\nReview\nHeeeeere\u2019s Genny!\n\n"

Even more sur-prising, it\u2019s because of\ndictators; they\u2019re more trouble than\nthey\u2019re worth aren\u2019t they? This week\nwe\u2019re in Pakistan.\nLast Saturday, nearly a week ago,\nPresident Pervez Musharraf declared\nemergency rule and suspended the\ncountry\u2019s constitution. Troops have\ntaken over TV and radio stations and\nindependent channels have gone off-air. The Supreme Court judges in Pakistan condemned the move and as a result are being confined to the Supreme\nCourt. Whether this means they aren\u2019t\nallowed to leave the building or they\nare being forced to sit in a courtroom\nand finally figure out what happened\nto Maddie, I just don\u2019t know.\nIn addition the acting head of the\nparty of exiled former PM Nawaz Sharif\nwas arrested, senior lawyers have been\ndetained and elections planned for\nJanuary have been delayed. Police and\nparamilitaries manned checkpoints\naround the parliament and presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad, on\nSunday morning. Martial law has been\nintroduced in all but name.\nThe reason for these bold moves is\nthat President Musharraf is increasingly desperate to hold onto power. He\nis facing increasing opposition from Islamic militants and the judiciary. The\nSupreme Court has taken several decisions against the government recently.\nCrucially, correspondents say, it has\nbeen hearing legal challenges to the\npresident\u2019s re-election in October and\nthere was fear in the government that\nit would rule against him.\nLuckily for Musharraf the U.S. and\nthe U.K are more concerned about his\ncommitment to the war on terror rather than his commitment to democracy.\nIf you\u2019re expecting similar sanctions to\nthose imposed on Burma recently then\ndon\u2019t hold your breath. The U.S. and\nthe U.K would like to see free and fair\nelections but given the choice between\nan undemocratic ally and democratic\nnon-ally, democracy never wins.\nThe question I hear you all screaming is \u2018what does Musharraf have to say\nfor himself?\u2019 He gave a speech around\nmidnight on Saturday in which he attempted to justify the actions, arguing\nthat the measures were necessary to\nfight terrorism and \u201cpreserve the democratic transition that I initiated eight\nyears back\u201d.\nWell there are two things to take\nfrom this. On the one hand Pakistan is\nbattling Islamic militants and recently\nattacks have increased in number and\nferocity. So when Musharraf claims\nthat there\u2019s a problem with terror-ists, he\u2019s not lying. However declaring\nemergency rule does little to help fight\nmilitants. What\u2019s really important is\nhis idea that he is trying to \u201cpreserve\nthe democratic transition\u201d. Initially\nMusharraf was not entirely unpopular.\nHe had won public consent to his rule\nbut now that he\u2019s facing increasing opposition he requires drastic measures\nto keep himself in power.\nWhat will be the result of these\nmeasures? Well there are 3 possi-bilities. Musharraf and his opponents\ncould all dig their heels in, resulting in\ncivil strife and a decrease in civil liber-ties. The U.S. will most likely try and\npersuade Musharraf that this is not the\nbest course of action but it remains to\nbe seen whether Musharraf will try to\nhold onto power at \u2018all costs\u2019. Another\npossible result is that Musharraf will be\nousted from power. Certainly his opponents seem to outnumber his friends\nnowadays and public opposition is\nlikely to grow in the face of emergency\nrule. In this case it will fall to former\nPrime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and\nNawaz Sharif to introduce democracy.\nDo not be fooled however into thinking that these two persons represent a\nbeacon of hope. They are unlikely to\nwork well together and their terms in\nPres Musharraf has come under critisism from his own people for being so intimately involved with the US war on terrorism\nContrary to the popular myth that there\nis no world outside South Kensington, Felix Politics aims to bring you just a sample of the highlights from the lives of the\nother 6 billion people on Earth.\nA case of bad head counting\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown has found\nhimself in another quagmire, this time\nover immigration. The office of national\nstatisticsreviseditsestimateofforeignna-tionals working in the UK from 800,000\nto 1.5m. Councils across the country are\nnow calling for an increased budget to\ncope with the extra numbers. 92.1% of\nBritain\u2019s ethnic make up is Caucasian.\nPetrol gets more expensive\nOil hit a new high of US$98 on Wednesday, edging ever nearer to the psycho-office \u2013 admittedly with a democratic\nmandate \u2013 were plagued with allegations of corruption and bad govern-ance. Finally, the solution which will\nallow for the greatest stability is a pow-er-sharing agreement between Musharraf and Bhutto. The U.S. backs this\nstrongly and it would allow Pakistan to\nmove towards democracy slowly and\nin a stable fashion. However Musharraf\u2019s recent moves show that he is all\nbut ready to ignore the lessons of history and go down in flames as a tyrannical dictator.\nAll I can say to you readers is we can\nonly wait and see.\nThe week gone by in six handy paragraphs\nlogical triple figure mark. Consequently,\nthe US dollar has fallen to a 26 year low\nrelative to the Pound Sterling, whilst securities like gold are trading near all time\nhighs.\nFinland school massacre\n7 pupils were killed this week in a school\nshooting in Finland hours after the gunman posted a video on YouTube. Finland\nhas the third highest per capita gun ownership in the world, though gun related\ncrime in the north European country is\nrare. The shootings comes a week after 2\nwere shot dead in a school in Cleveland\nand months after 32 were gunned down\nin a university in Virginia, America\u2019s\nworst student massacre.\nSarkozy repairs relations with\nUS\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy arrived\nin the US for talks with his counterpart\nGeorge W Bush with the hope of thawing relations since France\u2019s opposition to\nwar in Iraq. Sarkozy\u2019s style and direction\nhas won him many admirers in America\u2019s\nRepublican party, including Presidential\nhopeful Rudi Giuliani. However, such\ndiplomacy may prove fruitless as many\nbelieve Republican control of the White\nHouse will be lost in next year\u2019s election.\nM Sarkozy confirmed his divorce from\nwife of 11 years Cecilia last month.\nIran has 3,000 centrifuges\nIn greater defiance of US and European\nopinion, Iran has announced that it possesses 3,000 centrifuges for uranium\nenrichment. It is the second such claim\nwithin a month by President Ahmadinajad,andcomesdaysaftertheUNimposed\nnew sanctions on the country whilst also\ncalling for a halt of all such operations.\nAhmadinajad added, \u201cthey must know\nthat Iranians don\u2019t care about the sanc-tions, and Iranian people will not back\none inch from their nuclear rights\u201d.\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\nAnd finally, Thaliand\nOver a year since democratically elected\nPrime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was\nousted in a peaceful military coup, Thailand is once again gearing itself for poll-ing.

Since\nthe start of August they\u2019ve been paid to\nrepresent you to the College and to the\nwider world, and to run Union services\n\u2013 the bars, the events, student support,\nand facilities for all those clubs and\nsocieties.\nOne of these, the editor of this esteemed publication, is of course beyond reproach. Another \u2013 who is in\ncharge of the whole lot \u2013 is Stephen\nBrown, the Union President.\nNow, you may believe the Union is a\nperfect entity, a shining idyll of perfection in a world of disorder and distress\n(in which case you might want to know\nhow they manage this!) Or, possibly\nmore likely, there may be something\nthat even slightly concerns you\u2026 from\ndrink prices in Da Vinci\u2019s to the system\nof governance, from how the Union is\nspending its money, to its position on\ntop-up fees or the NUS. Is the Union\nproviding enough facilities, and the\nright ones? Are you a club member\nworried about how your club is run, or\na committee member worried about\nrunning a club? Or are you having\nproblems with any part of the College\n\u2013 Residences, the Registry, or seemingly random regulations - that you think\nthe Union should be pushing to have\nsorted out?\nIf only there was a way that the presi-dent, Stephen Brown could know your\nproblems \u2013 and, to let students across\nImperial know what could be done\nto get them solved. Well, fortunately\nthere is - quite simply, you can Ask The\nPresident.\nEach month, stoic tv puts your questions to the President of the Union, and\nletstheworldheartheresponses.Send-ing in your question is easy: just email\nit to askthepresident@stoictv.com.

Now\u2019s your chance to grill him\ntion answered, find out what the President can do about it, and who knows,\nthe Union may get that one step closer\nto perfection, thanks to you.\nAsk The President is one of several\nstoic tv shows in production, shot\nfrom our studio in the West Basement\nof Beit Quad. As well as newsy cur-I had sex with a famous pornstar last night\nNo I didn\u2019t. Well, I did, but this article\nis actually about taking photos in the\ndark.\nSo you\u2019ve bought some crappy camera and want to take pretty pictures\nwith it. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t\nenough space on this page to teach\nyou that, so I\u2019ll stick to trying to teach\nyou to take bearable-to-decent photos\n(face it, you\u2019ll never be as good as me\nanyway).\nThe biggest misconception about\ntaking photos in low light is about the\nuse of a flash. You do not want to be\nusing it most of the time. First of all,\nit will blind the pornstar, and second\nof all, it will give your subject a deer-in-the-headlights look, I guarantee it.\nThe first thing that one can do is turn\nthe ISO up, but this can both help and\nmake the photo worse. If it\u2019s starting to\nget dark and you cannot handhold to\ntake a photo, you can bump the ISO up\na bit which will help with your shaky\nhands. Mind you, putting the ISO too\nhigh will make your photos way more\ngrainy than is acceptable, so one must\nfind a balance.\nIf you do not have a flash that you\ncan detach from your camera (i.e. you\nhave a shitty point-and-shoot camera\nthat you got ripped off for in Jessops)\nthere is not much you can do with it.\nYou can either switch it off, or set your\ncamera to slow flash. This will make\nyour camera take a photo where the\nbackground is exposed correctly (i.e.\nnot pitch black), and use flash at the\nsame time to light up the hot chick in\nthe foreground.\nWhether you want your flash off or\non will obviously depend on the situ-ation. If you are taking a photo of anything more than 3 metres away from\nyou, flash is (mostly) useless. Whenever you\u2019re watching the best football\nteam ever (Chelsea) playing, for exam-ple, you will see thousands of flashes\ngoing off in the stands every second.\nDo they honestly think that their puny\nlittle flash will reach five billion miles\nto light up Sir Abramovich? You don\u2019t\nsee those guys with lenses as big as my\ndick (or Rob\u2019s) using a flash, and they\nare behind the advertising boards,\npretty close to the action.\nWhat they do use, though, are mo-nopods. Monopods and tripods are\none of the most essential things for a\npornographer. Lens, camera, photog-rapher, tripod. In that order.\nContrary to popular belief, a tripod is\nmuch more important than a flash. As\nan example, it allows you to take masterpieces such as the one on the right.\nAny landscape work that you do after\ndusk will require a tripod, I guaranee\nit. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t make sense to\ncarry a tripod with you at all times (es-pecially if you have a small point-and-shoot), but a tripod doesn\u2019t have to be\na tripod to be a tripod, know what I\u2019m\nsaying? Any substitute can be used,\nfrom buildings to benches to my Ferrari. For those of you who have banged\nenough pornstars to afford a DSLR and\nFelix Office Pornographer\nCoitus beautifultalis am Londonis Eyus\ncan control the exposure, don\u2019t forget\nto underexpose by half a stop. And\ndon\u2019t forget to use a timer, as your fat\npudgy little fingers will shake the camera when you press the shutter release.\nNow I am off for my lunch appointment with Ron Jeremy. I hope that today\u2019s lesson will come in handy.\n\n"

Alternatively, if prices were a bit lower then\nmaybe people would be more willing\nto tidy up their own mess.\nYours Faithfully,\nRobert Cook\nExtortionate\nprices causing\nthe Imperial\nmess\nIn defence of the\nRSM\nDear Felix,\nAs a veteran RSM student, I would like\nto defend the RSM following the article in last week\u2019s Felix. Stephen Brown\nmay well have stated that the RSM\nFreshers\u2019 Dinner is the \u201cMost Notorious Night of the Year\u201d, but the same\nman also stated that he thoroughly\nenjoyed the evening he oversaw from\nthe head table. Whilst it has to be said\nthat there were some \u201chappy puddles\u201d\nat the end of the evening, it was not the\nresult of deliberate efforts by elder stu-dents. The freshers were forewarned\nprior to the evening about the types of\nactivities likely to happen, and yet they\nare all eager to come along and take\npart, rather than attending the \u201cpleasant all round\u201d CGCU event they could\nalso have attended (surely this is a matter of opinion anyway? I know many\nwho would contest it is the most notoriously dull event of the year, but this is\nanother matter). It is always made clear\nto the freshers that they do NOT need\nto drink anything they don\u2019t want to\nand hosts understand that they are responsible for their freshers and should\nadvise the freshers when to stop drinking and offer them water instead.\nIndeed, there are some freshers who\ndrink too much, but largely this is their\nown doing through having just got to\nuniversity and wanting to stretch their\nwings and test their body, since many\nof them may not have had that freedom whilst at home under their parents\u2019 watchful eyes. However, what the\nNews Editor has omitted is that most\nstudents are well-behaved and have a\nthoroughly enjoyable time whilst not\nbeing paralytically drunk. The Editor has also testified wrongly that the\nother students show a \u201clack of care\u201d\nand are \u201cselfish\u201d towards the freshers,\nwhen in actual fact all freshers who do\nbecome too drunk are dutifully looked\nafter until a way of getting them home\nis sorted, which often results in the students taking them back to their halls\nthemselves, or paying for a taxi and enlisting help to get them back safely.\nTheRSMisbeingconstantlyknocked\ndown by the other faculty unions, most\nnotably by the CGCU, it has to be said.\nYet despite only (technically) being\na Clubs and Society Committee, the\nRSM still hosts more successful faculty\nevents than either the RCSU or CGCU,\nand whilst having a much smaller student population, the RSM consistently\ndraws in more students to their bar\nnights and dinners. Again technically,\nwe are supposed to be a subdivision of\nthe CGCU, and yet are ostracised from\neverything they do (and are slated in\nthe Guildsheet when trying to join in\ntheir bar night), offered no support by\nthem, and in fact have our property\nrepeatedly broken into and criminally\ndamaged by the so-called \u201cTrojan\nHorse\u201d mascot team (which is a particularly thuggish act). We think them\ntoo animals (and criminals) for such\nbehaviour of which their President\nis clearly in support of (see his proud\ngrin with his \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d team after\nstealing our mascot (and our inviolate\none which they have and are refusing\nto give back \u2013 is this not against their\nso-called \u201cRules of Mascotry\u201d?))?\nAs a final word, I\u2019d like to point out\nthe RSM students are not the only IC\nstudents who like to have a drink and\na good time \u2013 has anyone ever seen\nany of the ties initiations, the rugby\nclub\u2019s kangaroo courtroom, the Medics?! Whilst I\u2019m not slating those clubs\n(or approving), they are just as \u201cnotorious\u201d as the RSM Freshers\u2019 Dinner, and\nyet they don\u2019t get articles slating them\nall over Felix. At the end of the day\nthe RSMC&SC has many people who\ndedicate time and effort to ensuring\nvery popular events for its students,\nand a few freshers having too many\ndrinks at their fresher\u2019s dinner should\nnot be allowed to mar the reputation\nof an otherwise popular and historic\ninstitution.\nSusie Ogilvie\nRoyal School of Mines Committee\nmember 07/08\nBad behaviour\nis down to\nindividuals, not\nthe RSM as a\ncollective\nDear Felix,\nOn behalf of the under-represented\nwithin the Royal School of Mines I\nwish to complain about the represen-Felix hears from Royal School of Mines members in response to last week\u2019s article about the behaviour of\nstudents which included those at the RSM Freshers\u2019 Dinner and another reader replies to Mr Elliott\u2019s letter\nGilead Amit\nI\nt's very easy to be a cynic. I\nknow, because I can do it. It's a\nnatural compulsion to seek to\ncriticize the work and beliefs of\nothers, and we all indulge in that\nto some degree. To construct something oneself, however, is inconceivably harder.\nBeing an idealist is hard work. Again,\nI know this first-hand. It is difficult to\nlook for the good in man, and emotionally exhausting to tie yourself to\na given cause. Almost despite myself,\nI admire them. Not because they're\nright (which they rarely are), and not\nbecause they're easier to get along with\n(an argument with an idealist is likely\nto be twice as long and four times as\nbrutal as an argument with a cynic),\nbut because they have courage.\nThere are two types of courage.\nThere's the kind that's celebrated in\nsongs and legends: the moment where\na decision has to be taken, and an\nunseen, previously unknown motivation causes you to make a hard yet\npotentially rewarding choice. As has\nbeen expressed in countless quota-tions, such courage implicitly depends\non fear \u2013 if you are not overcoming\nfear, then you are not doing anything\nextraordinary.\nThis type of courage is impossible\nto analyse. People who attempt to put\nthemselves into the shoes of their heroes are deluding themselves.\nCourageous choices cannot be made\nout of context, and it is a depressing exercise to sit, without adrenaline\nrushing through your body, without\nyour heart beating like a horse parade,\nwithout cold sweat running down your\nback like Niagara Falls, and look at all\nthe noble and heroic decisions you feel\nthat you could never make. Again, I\ntalk from experience.\nThe second type of courage is a great\ndeal more interesting. For me, this is\nthe strength to carefully reflect upon\na choice, weigh up the pros and cons,\nand decide to take the harder course of\naction. We tend to call this 'standing\nby one's convictions', and is one of the\nattributes I admire the most.\nBut I am equally impressed, especially today, by people who have the\ncourage to have any convictions at all.\nPeople who are not content to watch\nglobal events with the detachment of\nthose who read the sporting scores\nthe day after the match. That rarest of\ngroups, the actual supporters, those\nwho get involved \u2013 the match-time\nstreakers of politics.\nIt is very tempting to be morally lazy:\nto change convictions and beliefs with\nimpunity because you never properly\nestablished them to begin with. It's less\nimportant to me to know that someone will stand by their beliefs than it is\nto know that they actually have beliefs.\nThat they took the time and effort, and\nbraved the emotional risks of aligning\nthemselves with something that may\nturn out to be wrong, and may make\nthem out to look foolish.\nIdealists are often blind to opposing\narguments. They tend to take things\nfor granted rather than question them.\nThey die out very quickly, they are\noften wrong, and they get used and\nabused by us insightful cynics.\nI wish I could be one of them. I really do.\nCynicism, idealism and courageousness\ntations made in the article last week\nby Andrew Somerville regarding the\nRSM. The RSM is a diverse body of\nstudents, not all of whom take part in\nor condone the activity of the Chaps or\nevents at the RSM dinner.\nVomit + urine + broken glass + food\nfights = drunk students \u2013 so write an\narticle about the evils of alcohol and\nlets have a bit less of the i\u2019venevergot\ntendrunkanddonesomethingstupid attitude disturbing my in-lecture reading\nof Felix and frankly, pissing me off.\nWhat\u2019s with making out like all students hailing from the RSM are some\nbreed of deranged howler monkeys\nwith Freudian complexes?! COME\nON!!! The event in question is being\nblown entirely out of proportion. Yes,\nsome students were poorly behaved.\nBut, to compare the RSM to the CGCU\nis ridiculous. For a start, some RSM\nmembers attended the CGCU ball and\nyet it still went without a hitch. I\u2019m\nsure if those present at the RSM dinner had sobered up in time to make it\nCGCU that would have been trashed\ntoo. So then, excuse me stating the obvious here:\n1) The behaviour at the RSM dinner\nwas perpetuated by individuals and is\nnot reflective of the department as a\nwhole.\n2) The sun does not shine out of the\nCGCU\u2019syou-know-whatjustbecauseit\nis called the CGCU but because people\ndon\u2019t associate it with a crazy drunken\nbooze up in the same way as they do\nthe RSM dinner \u2013 but now that you\u2019ve\nthrown down the gauntlet who knows\nwhat those crazy guilders might try!\n3) Worse behaviour is seen every\nweek in the Union (go ask some stewards about last week\u2019s Wednesday\nnight if you don\u2019t believe me)\nWhat can we conclude dear read-ers? Behaviour is down to the individual and not something intrinsic to\na department. So let\u2019s stop with the\n\u201cpoor reputation\u201d business \u2013 it\u2019s silly\nand everyone knows \u201cpoor reputation\u201d\ntranslates to students as \u201ccool reputation\u201d because our events are so mental\nthey\u2019re BANNED! Yeah baby we\u2019re wii-iiiiiiiilllddd!!! *V-SIGN* and all the rest\nof it... So stop making it cool! Just leave\nthe little children alone, they will grow\nout of it and into functional people\nand all that\u2019s going to happen with the\ndinner is that it\u2019ll go somewhere else\nwhere they don\u2019t care if you smash it\nup as long as you pay for it \u2013 and then\nMr S\u2019ll have nothing to write about!\nAnd as for the downfall of humanity\nvia the discourteousness of the younger generation \u2013 well, I\u2019m a bit more\nscared of the 12 year old hoodies that\nhang around my area with knives than\nI am about the litter in the JCR (al-though litter is bad! Don\u2019t litter!) Let\u2019s\nfocus our attention on the slightly more\npressing matters at hand and not ruin\nImperial\u2019s bit of sunshine that is Felix\nbemoaning the ills of the youth today.\nOh yeah, and before you moan about\nthe RSM again, take a closer look at the\nhome departments of the Sabbs... Fuck\nyeah! We\u2019re not all the same and we\u2019re\nnot all bad so give the RSM a break.\nA 4th Year Observer\nRoyal School of Mines\nFelix News Editor, Andrew Somerville, responds to the comments made\nby the RSM members:\nThe article published last week was\nnot intended as an attack on all RSM\nmembers, nor to portray them as \u201cderanged howler monkeys\u201d. In an article\nabout an event which I did not attend,\nall I can do is report comments and\nstatements from witnesses and the subsequent fallout.\nThe fact of the matter is that we at Felix have received and invited opinions\nfrom various people, both attending\nand not attending the dinner in ques-tion. Most of these were negative.\nI have since spoken to the RSM President about the article, and assured him\nthat whilst I am not out to persecute the\nRSM, I am duty-bound to report what I\nbelieve is newsworthy.\nThe RSM has a devoted and cohesive\nunion, something I believe should be\nadmired, and I know that their representatives put in a great deal of work to\nmake sure it stays that way. However,\nthe fact remains that the RSM Freshers\u2019\ndinner was a step too far for many ob-servers, and has not improved the RSM\u2019s\npoor reputation for similar events.\n\n"

The exhibition\ncomes off as unjus-tifiably egocentric\nwhen you consider\nthat the rest of the\nmuseum is taken\nup with someone\nas dramatic as\nZaha Hadid,\nand that the\ntruly iconic\nexhibition\nis residing\nsomewhere\non Cromwell\nRoad at the V&A.

Most discount fashion and\neven design as valid art forms, so how\nfar can you push to make the most frivolous end of the spectrum seem legiti-mate? And was Williamson really the\nbest choice to represent fashion in the\narena of design?\nOn the one hand, one hardly feels the\nenvelope being tugged when viewing\nhis clothes. On the other, as a conduit\nfor opening the glam squad to the idea\nof fashion as more than\nfun and games (read:\npacking them in), he\nwas ideal \u2013 it is a pleasant introduction, just\nengaging enough while\nserving up a healthy\nscoop of eye candy.\nBut it\u2019s not to say we\ncouldn\u2019t do better. The\nhype, the buzz and excitement \u2013 this is part\nof the Williamson ex-perience.

It not only woke me up but\nreally put a smile on my face! Autumn\nleaves do it for me.\nHowever, my northern blood tells\nme it just isn\u2019t cold enough. In November, I expect my fingers to be falling off\nwith frostbite and by breath to be visible when you exhale. Remember when\nyou were little and you used to do that\nto pretend you were either a dragon, or\nsmoking... depending on how much of\na childhood you actually had.\nAnd speaking of childhood, we all\nused to enjoy a good day out when\nwe were kiddly-winkles - just you and\nMummy and Daddy (or possibly Daddy and Daddy) and a day of frolicking\nin the autumn leaves. I miss that.\nHowever we can all make up for this\nloss by spending the day at one of these\nwonderful institutions showcased in\nthis week\u2019s Arts Pages. Emily Wilson\nspent the day in the National Portrait\nGallery to see the highly acclaimed Pop\nArt Portraits exhibitons.

You must be familar with\nthose period dramas on the tellybox\nand how they sat around in the evenings reading verse to each other. Poetry was made to be read aloud and in\norder to demonstrate this I chose this\nfabulously bloody poem, The Charge\nof the Light Brigade. The verses are\nso rhythmic; but to get across the cantering horses carrying their riders to\ntheir death you are required to read it\nat high speed.

Hear ye, hear ye\nThis week in \u201cStudent Art in Focus\u201d,\nlet us take a look\ninto poetry. Jack\nE Cronin is an\nexperimental artist to\nsay the least. Cronin\nwas previously reviewed in Felix a few\nweeks back, where\nwe took a look at a\nsample of his contemporary collection,\n\u2018Tom?\u2019. While his art\nerrs towards the side\nof minimalism, Cronin\u2019s\npoetry takes a more traditional approach.\nThe poem \u201cDirty Pigeon\u201d attempts to convey an alternative conception of London\u2019s\nattitude. It is all too easy\nto want to run over pigeons\non one\u2019s bike, or complain about\nthe pigeon as being nothing better than an annoyingly frequent\npest. However, typical of Cronin,\nwhose reputation is growing by\nthe day, he questions these common perceptions. The line\n\u201cFree to roam wherever it\nfeels\u201d really emphasizes\nthe freedom of the\npigeon, in comparison to the\nutilitarian\nlifestyles\nof Londoners.\nDirty Pigeon\nYou duck away as the dirty pigeon\nwith ruffled feathers flies past your\npath,\nIts a dirty flying rat you see.\nYou are blind to it until it passes by\nYOU.\nWhy would you notice?\nIt has no friends,\nNo reason to live. In your view.\nWhy is this so?\nDoes it not keep the company of the\nopen sky?\nFree to roam wherever it feels.\nNo boundaries.\nNo expectations.\nUnrestricted.\nWho really lives the better life?\nMaybe it is actually you who crosses\nthe PIGEONS path.\n\n"

Imperial got\noff to a rocky start with team captain\nMaurice Berk losing 3 \u2013 5 in his first\nmatch up, Will Hoy only managing a 5\n\u2013 5 draw and Luka Lukic defeated 2 \u2013\n5. Maurice lost his second match 3 \u2013 5,\nLuka drew his 5 \u2013 5 and Will lost 2 \u2013 5,\nleaving the scores at 20 \u2013 30 and Imperial staring defeat in the face. Luka,\never the consummate competitor, then\nstunned all onlookers with an unbelievable 14 \u2013 5 victory in his final sabre\nmatch, cementing his position as \u2018Man\nof the Match\u2019 and leaving Imperial only\na point adrift. Sadly Maurice and Will\nwere not able to capitalise, losing their\nfinal matches 5 \u2013 2 and 5 \u2013 3 respec-tively, leaving the final score for sabre\nat 39 \u2013 45 and Imperial with a small\nmountain to climb in order to get back\ninto the contest.\nFoil was up next and Imperial got off\nto a perfect start with Nathan Blundell,\nEz Hassan and Norris Lo all winning\ntheir first matches. Nathan then demolished his second opponent 5 \u2013 1,\nNorris drew 5 \u2013 5 and Ez\u2019s match went\nto time, finishing at 4 \u2013 2. At this point\nImperial were 29 \u2013 17 in the lead and\nwell in control. The UCL captain then\napproached Maurice and ominously\nannounced he wished to make a substitution for the final foil match. In the\nmean time, Norris defeated his final\nopponent 6 \u2013 3 and Nathan drew his\nmatch 5 \u2013 5. Ez then took his place\non the piste with the scores at 40 \u2013 25\nand victory seemingly assured. His\nopponent, the mysterious substitute,\nhad other plans however, making Ez\nwork hard to keep the scores close at\n4 \u2013 6 before the match went to time,\nleaving everyone wondering why UCL\nhad used their best foilist only as a sub-stitute, and speculating as to how different things might have been had he\nbeen fencing from the start.\nGoing into \u00e9pe\u00e9, the scores stood\nat 83 \u2013 76, affording Imperial some\nbreathing space. It seemed like they\nmight need it when Maurice lost his\nfirst match 2 \u2013 5 to the opposing captain but Luka got things back on track\nwith an 8 \u2013 4 victory against his first\nopponent. Ez, a foilist masquerading\nas an \u00e9pe\u00e9ist, then went down to a 5 \u2013\n6 defeat. Maurice got back to winning\nways with a close fought 5 \u2013 4 victory\nbut Ez continued to struggle and lost\nhis second match 1 \u2013 6.

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n30 Friday 9 November 2007\nfelix\nSport\nW\nith the start\nof a new\nyear looming ominously on\nthe horizon, 15 rock climbers got together to tackle the mountains and\nbrave the elements of... Mallorca.\nSo, not really an extreme outdoor adventure then, but definitely the sort\nof kick-off that every academic year\nshould have with sun, sea and rock to\nkeep us entertained. As we stepped off\nthe plane on foreign soil, new president Alex warned us that we would\nhave 3 \u201cGolf-size\u201d cars of an unknown\nmake and model between the lot of us,\nwhich sent shivers down the spines of\nthe more experienced members of the\nclub. Since everyone was expecting\nto be packed like sardines into tiny\ncars, everyone let out a collective\nsigh of relief when were shown to\nour shiny new-model Meganes.\nThe relief turned into joy when we\nfinally stumbled upon our villa in Valldemossa, a beautiful 7-room behemoth\nof a house, complete with swimming\npool, 3 patios and a grill. After a frantic\ngame of 15-player bed shotgun, everyone settled down for the first night of\nthe holiday.\nIn the morning, we were greeted by a\nstunning view of the Valldemossa val-ley, and over a relaxed lunch picked\nour first climbing destination of the\ntrip - a light warm-up at the nearby\ncrag of S\u2019estret. As the sun rose and\ntemperatures soared, the initial wave\nof energetic climbing died off, but\nnot before Virgil and Hal ticked\noff a 6c on a brilliant limestone\noverhang.\nEventually, we found ourselves back at the villa making\ndinner at a very traditionally\nSpanish time, with the barbecue fired up only around\n9 in the evening - a time we\nwould stick to throughout\nthe week and a half. Thanks\nto the excellent efforts of\nmedic Ollie at the hobs, the\nfood throughout the holiday\nwas uncharacteristically good for an\nICMC trip.\nThe days that followed saw some\nexcellent climbing being done at Sa\nGubia and other crags around Valldemossa. Sa Gubia saw some first-time\nmulti-pitching for some members, but\nwill perhaps be remembered most for\nan absolutely terrifying fall by Alex\noff an excellent 6a+. A foot popping\nwhile clipping a distant bolt from an\nawkward position lead to a 20-foot fall,\nwhich ended up about 10 feet from the\nground - and he was still back on the\nroute right afterwards. Most amusing,\nhowever, was an epic descent from a\n4-pitch climb by Virgil, Hal and Joe,\nwho (in an effort to reduce the descent\ntime from a predicted 90 minutes) ab-seiled off an overhanging face onto a\nrusty anchor and then proceeded to get\nlost for the next four hours, arriving at\nthe car-park well after dark.\nBy the time we had our first rest day,\neveryone had been on a lead rope and\nconfidence was rising. The rest day saw\nmost of the club get a taste for some\ndeep-water soloing on some of the excellent crozzly (it\u2019s hard to describe,\nbut you\u2019d know it if you saw it) rock\nin the bay. With such an excellent selection of crags around, the days that\nfollowed saw some splitting up of the\ngroup, with some climbers preferring\nthe multi-pitch routes of Sa Gubia to\nthe 0-second walk-in of the Roadside\nCrag. Both ended up being firm favourites of the trip - with special mention going to the 6c+ roof at the roadside crag that went up in an alcove and\nthen straight over the road, mere feet\nabove the passing cars.\nAnother excellent destination was\nCala Magraner, which, despite its distant location, combined perfectly the\nthings we came for - sand, sea, sun and\nrock. It was on this day that Virgil attacked his first 7a of the trip, a short,\ntechnical route on tiny holds, which\nyielded a clean lead at the very end of\nthe day.\nWith over a week gone already, most\nof the team felt it was time to try some\nproper deep-water soloing, so we\nheaded out to Port de Soller - an\nhour away on small, winding roads.\nOn arrival, we discovered that the\ncrag was quite a way away, with a\ngood 200 metre swim in choppy\nseas. While some doubted their\nswimming ability and stayed be-hind, 7 intrepid climbers swam out.\nTowards the tail-end of the cross-ing, with the cliff looming mere metres away, Katie screamed bloody\nmurder and all eyes swept the seas\nfor dorsal fins.\nIn the rescue attempt that fol-lowed, all 7 people in the sea managed to get stung by the school of\njellyfish that had floated into the\nbay. After quite a bit of difficulty\ngetting back to civilisation, Katie\u2019s\npainful sting was neutralized by a\nlifeguard and we abandoned our efforts at soloing for the day. Five of\nus did make a trip out to do some\ndeep water solo a few days later, this\ntime without hordes of tentacled\nbeasts to stop us.\nAs the trip neared its end, Katie\nhad to say goodbye a few days early\nto start uni (it\u2019s a hard knock life for\nmedics), leaving the rest of us to\nenjoy one day each of climbing and\nrest. On the rest day, one car of people went out to Magalluf (a place\nthat can only be described as Chav\nVegas) and had a jolly good time at\nBCM, the biggest club in Mallorca.\nWell, jolly good until Seb lost his\npassport in a drunken haze, leading\nto an international, multi-day slog\nto get back to England. But, with the\ntrip having been such a success oth-erwise, it was hard to feel demoral-ised by one person\u2019s plight, and all\nlooked back on a fun-filled yet relaxed two weeks of climbing bliss,\ncompletely unlike England. No, in\nMallorca there were no decades-old\nUnion minibuses, no gentle pattering of freezing rain and not half\nas much gloomy darkness as back\nhome in England.\nMountaineers\nsummer tour to\nMallorca\nAlexander Borresen reports on blue skies,\nbeautiful seas and a bit of climbing here and there\n\n"

    "content": "33\nfelix\nFriday 9 November 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nThe importance of\ndiet and exercise\nLinda Hagg\nA healthy balanced diet will provide\nyour muscles with the energy that is\nneeded in order to perform well. A\nhealthy diet consists of a balanced mix\nof nutrients: carbohydrates, protein\nand fat, as well as minerals and vita-mins. You need to have a sufficient\ncalorie intake in order to maintain\nyour metabolic and activity needs. An\nexcessive calorie intake results in fat\nstorage. How many calories you need a\nday varies depending on body size, age,\ngender and physical activity performed\nby the individual. The amount of each\nfood group needed will depend on the\ntype of sport played, the amount of\ntraining completed and the time spent\nplaying your sport.\nCarbohydrate is used as the main\nsource of fuel when exercising and if\nthere is not enough of it the performance will be limited. The best carbohydrates are complex carbohydrates and\nthey are found in foods such as fruits,\npotatoes, pasta, wholegrain breads and\ncereals.\nProtein is probably the most talked\nabout nutrient amongst people who\nare working out in the gym. So why is\nprotein so important? Its main functions are to support growth and to\nrepair body tissues. The best food\nsources for protein include meat, fish,\nand legumes (dried beans and peas).\nHowever, eating too much protein can\ncause harm to your kidneys and liver,\ndue to the excess strain they are put\nunder whilst processing protein. In\norder to avoid damaging the kidneys\nthese toxic waste products need to be\ndiluted with large amounts of water in\norder to be excreted through the urine.\nThe urinary excretion causes an increase in water loss and increases the\nchance for dehydration. Furthermore\nwhen too much protein is present in\nthe diet, the absorption of calcium in\nparticular is prevented. It causes high\nlosses of calcium in the urine which\ncan cause osteoporosis.\nIt is often thought that if you are\nphysically active you should avoid\nfats at all costs if good health is to be\nachieved and maintained. However the\nbody needs a certain amount of fat in\norder to function properly. Fats or lipids are necessary part of a healthy diet,\nbecause they are a source of stored\nenergy.\nIt has been discussed however you\nshould avoid saturated fat, since it increases the risk of heart disease compared with monosaturated (found in\nolives, avocados and peanuts) and\npolysaturated fats (found in fish, nuts,\nsunflower and cod liver oils). It is wise\nto substitute saturated fat with unsaturated fat whenever possible. Water is\nthe most important nutrient, yet the\nmost overlooked one. Water is essential to maintaining good hydration and\nbody temperature. Always make sure\nyou drink plenty of water before, during and after your work out.\nA poor diet will have a negative effect\non the performance of even the most\ncasual athlete. Make sure you have a\ngood diet with adequate nutrients and\ncalories so that you have enough energy to enjoy your workout. It\u2019s all about\nmoderation and using your common\nsense.\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 2\nQueen Mary\u2019s Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nChloe Joyeux\nOn a bright and clear Halloween day,\nthe IC Football Women 1st XI and\nFootball Men 5th XI arrived at Harlington, each ready to kick-ass against\nrespective Queen Mary\u2019s sides. The latter however, in accordance with their\nreputation, were awfully late. The 5th\nXI, being bored, challenged the 1st XI\nto a pre-match game. Despite not wishing to embarrass the men, the women\nreluctantly agreed to their pleas.\nWith Squashy as the ref, the game\nstarted. It was agreed that the men\nwould only be allowed to play two-touch football in order to practice their\nappalling passing. Being extremely sure\nof themselves, they decided to not have\na goalie and have an all-attacker for-mation. Of course, the women fought\nbravely, with Yoke performing a clean\ntackle on Tariq, who as a result took a\nridiculous dive, not knowing what had\nhappened to him. The shortest player\nof the women\u2019s team then proceeded\ntowards the goal of the opposition.\nThe men scored a disallowed goal\nwhich was immediately judged offside\nby the fair Squashy, despite many of\nthem gesticulating at the decision and\non the verge of tears. The men, trying\ntheir hardest to leave the game with\ntheir pride intact, proceeded to shoot\nat the goal from all directions and towards all directions, leaving the goal\nmostly untouched. Several clearances\nfrom Emma, Cheryl and Kate did the\ntrick, although Emily was able to show\noff her skills with a few saves. The boys\nstruggled with their two-touch rule,\nbeing unable to play as a team, enabling\nPav, Mona and Steph to take advantage\nof their bad passes. Gui tried to keep\nthe team together by screaming at each\nplayer on his team what they were do-ing...maybe his way of asking for the\nball. Many others were shouting, although it was difficult to decipher\nwhat they were trying to say.\nFinally Skeen was able to score, but\nonly by taking his shirt off. The wom-en, in disgust at the man-breasts, had\nto avert their eyes, giving Skeen a clear\npath to the goal and bringing the score\nto 1-0 after the first few minutes. However the score did not stay put very\nlong. After a foul from Tariq, a penalty\nwas generously awarded to the girls.\nLouise took advantage of it and shot.\nSkeen, now in goal, did not even have\ntime to save the penalty and collapsed\nlike Mr. Potato Head on the treadmill.\nMore efforts were made by the men,\nnoticeably by shooting straight at the\ngirl defenders. Kate suffered from such\na blow from Mike Allen, taking a full\npowered shot on her arm. Being a war-rior, she did not flinch despite the pain\nand continued defending, although\nshe did show us later her really red,\nwounded skin. The last attempt by\nthe boys was a shot just metres from\nthe goal which hit the crossbar in true\nAkinbiyi style. At this point, Queen\nMary\u2019s finally appeared and the game\nhad to be stopped. The final score\ntherefore remained 1-1, with the men\nfeeling gutted at having missed their\nchance to shine.\nThe men, however, made up by beating Queen Mary\u2019s 2-1. The women\nhad less luck and conceded a goal in\nthe first half, minutes from half-time.\nDespite the shortened halves, or perhaps because of the lack of time, they\nwere unable to come back and equal-ise. Queen Mary\u2019s did not lack big girls\nand from this point of view, were at an\nadvantage over the IC women, who\nalways seem smaller than their op-ponents, (maybe because of Yoke and\nMona?). Despite lacking in this area,\nhowever, they defended well. Emily in\ngoal saved a few, although most shots\nwent wide or came slowly at her. They\nwill, therefore, be looking forward to\nSunday, when they are to face Queen\nMary\u2019s once again. Steph, who had\nsome beef with their number 10, 7, and\n9, will especially be happy to renew\nher connections with these beasts and\nshow them what she\u2019s made of.\nFootball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 0\nQueen Mary\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st 1\nFootballers play friendly before facing QM\nThe football team competing for a high ball\nRugby 1st go top of the table\nJovan Nedi\u0107\n& Joe Sanders\nRugby\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV 26\nRUMS 1st XV 5\nAfter a sensational performance\nagainst Portsmouth last week, the 1st\nXV were ready to entertain top of the\ntable Royal University Medical School\n(RUMS) at Harlington.\nThroughout the week the side has\nbeen practising a more open style of\nplay similar to the style that the Fijians\nplay in their sevens. It was aimed to be\nused as an addition to the phenomenal\nstyle the team has developed in the\ntight play, and it was pulled off during\nthe game on Wednesday.\nThe game started in the same style\nas it did last week, their forwards were\nattempting to dominate the Imperial forwards, and were successful for\nabout the first 10 minutes, yet RUMS\nfailed to push this advantage. After\nthat rather surprising wake up call, the\nforwards decided to rise to the challenge and managed to stabilise the\nscrums, as well as the rucks and mauls.\nThis gave the backs the platform they\nneeded to do their magic, with fly-half\nJoe Brown slicing the RUMS defence in\ntwo and off\u2013loading to Tom Zeal who\nwent over the line for a try.\nRUMS were not yet ready to give up,\nand after successfully stopping the Imperial rolling maul in its tracks, they\nattempted their own and managed to\nscore the try that brought them back\ninto the game.\nThe Imperial forwards, wounded by\nthis show of power and their pride in\ntatters, decided to up the pace and towards the end of the first half managed\nto set up a rolling maul from a line-out,\nwhich Alex Johnstone manoeuvred\nover the try line for Imperial second\ntry.\nThis spur in confidence let the\nfront row believe that they were wing-ers, with tight-head prop (that\u2019s me\n\u201cBodger\u201d) slicing through the line for\na 30 metre amble up the wing, but was\nunable to off-load it to Daniel Godfrey\nwho was in support. The first half ended with Imperial leading 14 - 5.\nThe second half saw a bit of a drama\nqueen act from Twat of the Match Joe\nBrown for not having his favourite ball\nto play with. However once the game\nwas underway, all of the weeks training\nwas paying off, with the team enforcing the open style of play on the game.\nFull-back Max Joachim scored a well\nexecuted try, which involved virtually the entire team. A similar try was\nSouth East 1A\nP W D L F A Diff Pts\n1 Imperial 5 4 0 1 100 42 58 12\n2 RUMS 5 4 0 1 107 85 22 12\n3 GKT 5 2 0 3 123 122 1 6\n4 Brunel 4 2 0 2 84 79 5 6\nThe 1st XV \u2018back line\u2019 in action against RUMS\nscored again with loose-head prop Joe\n\u201cBadger\u201d Sanders storming through\nthe line, and unlike his compatriot,\nmanaged to off-load the ball to centre Tom Carroll for the final try of the\nmatch. RUMS, hoping for some sort\nof consolation, increased the pressure,\nbut strong defence by Imperial meant\nthat the score remained at 26-5 until\nthe final whistle.\nMan of the Match went to Tom Zeal,\nbut special mention has to go to Dan\nGodfrey who put in an excellent per-formance, it\u2019s just a shame he can\u2019t remember it.\n\n"

Greenwald is now a screenwriter\nand works for an theatre advertising\ncompany.\nJohn&Jen is about the relationship\nbetween Jen and the two Johns in her\nlife; her brother and her son. In the\nfirst act, we explore the lives of John\nand Jen, brother and sister growing\nup in Post-WWII America; a time of\nmixed opinions about government, violence and love. The pair are followed\nall the way from John\u2019s birth until early\ntwenties. It\u2019s not the perfect childhood\neither, their father is abusive and Jen\ndoes her best to hide her little brother\nfrom this fact and protect him from\nthe abuse. The siblings go through the\nissues that all siblings go through from\nforcing your sibling to play with you\nwhen they don\u2019t want to, to suddenly\njust a few years later not wanting to see\nthem anywhere near you.\nAct two is concerned with the relationship of Jen, now grown up, and her\nson John. Obviously, the back-story\nfrom the first act is still relevant and\nfollowed up on in the second act. Jen\ngoes through many of the emotions\nand events she went through in the first\nact, thus taking up the opportunity to\nshow how the decisions we make can\nchange our lives for better or worse.\nSpecific scenarios from the first act are\nechoed in the second, allowing the audience to compare and contrast. It was\ninteresting to see the way Jen\u2019s attitude\ntowards Christmas had changed with\nwhat had happened to her. I loved the\nvery true to life Dear God, where Jen\nmoans about her brother embarrassing her at a basketball match and then\nBaseball where the second act John\nmoans about his mother\u2019s actions at\nhis baseball match in exactly the same\nway.\nAndrew Lippa\u2019s music fits perfectly\nto the mood of the play; it\u2019s childlike\nwhen it needs to be yet mature and\nthoughtful at other times, with the\nsame recurring themes appearing to\nremind the audience of previous songs\nand episodes. Tom Greenwald\u2019s lyrics\nare witty and perceptive, together they\ncapture the innocence of childhood\nand the loss of that innocence.\nA lot of responsibility is laid upon\nthe two actors, as they have to carry\nall of the storyline and all of the songs.\nHelen Evans and Jon Hawkins manage\nthis brilliantly. Both actors have to take\ntheir characters from childhood (in\nHawkin\u2019s case, birth) through to being\na fully matured adult, Hawkins doing\nthis twice for two completely different characters. Seeing as some people\ncan\u2019t manage this in the twenty or so\nyears they have to grow up, this makes\nthe task even harder. I fell in love with\nHawkin\u2019s John; his characterisation of\nthe young boy was so authentic that\nit made it all the harder to handle the\ntragedy that prevails later in the play.\nHis voice is amazing (he\u2019s going on\nto do the tour of Mamma Mia next;\nI think his talent is worth more than\nthat!) Plus he has these crazy piercing\nblue eyes!\nEvans\u2019 Jen was so genuine; you could\nreally see her transformation from\nbratty sister, through hippy to loving\nand (slightly over)caring mother. The\nemotions she has to go through are\nimmense and Evans copes with these\nadmirably, her voice did get lost at\nsome moments, but this just added to\nthe emotion. The connection between\nthese two actors both as brother and\nsister and mother and son is really be-lievable, even having to change from\none to the other.\nI loved the simplicity and modest\nnature of John&Jen, it\u2019s such an honest show. Although the down to earth\naspect to it and the strong and realistic\nstoryline makes me think of the show\nmore as a play that happens to have\nsinging in it. The score and lyrics are\nreally strong and the two performers\nare amazing both vocally and as ac-tors. The musicians are also on stage:\njust a basic electric piano and a single\nviolinist. Both are played by very talented musicians. I liked the use of lidded boxes to both set (as moving box-es, a bed, chairs\u2026) and told hold the\nprops for the entire show as there are\nno wings or off stage space, the way the\nmoving of these was incorporated into\nthe action was really clever.\nThe show leaves you questioning the\ndecisions you make about yourself and\nthose around you and about the relationships you have. Everyone can relate\nto at least one of the relationships embodied in the play, everyone has been a\nbrother, a sister, a mother or a child.\nThe Finborough theatre is a great little theatre, and it\u2019s doing a lot to promote the off-West End scene which,\nlets face it, isn\u2019t doing that great, and\nnew plays and musicals in general.\nEven if you decide that Jon&Jen isn\u2019t\nyour thing, you should definitely get\nyourself along to the Finborough some\ntime, there\u2019s always a great selection of\nmaterial on during the season and they\noffer student discounts too. If you\u2019re\never after somewhere different to go,\ntry it! You never know, you might enjoy it!\nThis gem of a show in that gem\nof a theatre is on this Sunday\n11th, next Sunday 18th and the\nMonday after. That is IT. So get\non it. Go!!\nSee www.finboroughtheatre.\nco.uk for more information.\nScraping the barrel for pictures... What the family might look like\nThe Finborough Theatre on Finborough Road, just down the way from Earl\u2019s Court tube station\nJohn and Jen is on for two Sunday nights only, so get on your bike!\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix\nFriday 9 November 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nI hadn\u2019t heard of the Gore-tex TransAlpine run until a chance discovery\non the Internet. This 8-stage foot race\nacross four countries in the European\nAlps looked set to be a fantastic excuse\nfor another summer holiday. The race\nitself covered 240km in its eight-day\nroute across Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. The longest day was\na full marathon with the added bonus\nof 1844m of ascent (more than you\nwould do if you climbed the highest\nmountain in the UK from sea level).\nLuckily I had sufficient youthful over-confidence and an enthusiastic running partner (Joseph Johnstone). We\nhad soon entered with little thought\nfor the consequences and settled down\nto get some training in.\nSix months later, with the magnitude\nof the race finally dawning on us we\nboarded our flight to get to the race.\nGradually over the last few months,\nour dreams of victory faded as training had floundered amidst exams and\nother holidays. We were now slightly\nconcerned that we wouldn\u2019t be able to\nfinish the race. Making it to the end\nwas our only concern.\nOur arrival at the event was greeted\nwith an array of sponsor\u2019s adverts,\ntents and marquees as well as many\npairs sporting the logos of their own\npersonal sponsors. We felt somewhat\nout of place with no sponsor and no\nexpensive gear. Still, without allowing\nour competitors to smell our fear, we\nregistered and settled down to the first\nof our nightly pasta parties \u2013 unlimited\npasta for racers, provided by the village\nat the end of each stage, was a welcome\nend to each day\u2019s exertions and fantastic preparation for the following day.\nThe following morning we awoke\nnervously to heavy rain and poked our\nway through the continental breakfast\nwhilst wondering where our bacon and\neggs were and contemplating the day\nahead. In next to no time we were all\nkitted out and nervously waiting in the\nstart box. We had cheekily taken our\nposition right at the front of the pack\n\u2013 the youngest team in the competition and visually the most eager. The\nannouncer gradually raised the tempo\nuntil we were all ready to go. The sound\nof \u2018Highway to Hell\u2019 blared from the PA\nsystem as the countdown ticked. The\nstarter\u2019s pistol sounded and the race be-gan. The start was \u2018neutralised\u2019 meaning we were to follow motorbikes until\nwe left the village; the pavements were\nlined with people for the first kilome-tre. I was surrounded by international\nendurance athletes, each excelling in\nthe field and I was struggling to keep\nup. There was no danger of overtaking\nthe leading motorbikes.\nThe first ten kilometres of this first\nday were easily the hardest section of\nthe entire race for me. I am not a road\nrunner and these first ten kilometres\nwas largely flat and on a road-like sur-face. As a result and due to the excitement of the race we failed to pace ourselves and this left me struggling for\nmuch of the rest of the day. However,\nwe did make good time initially and\ncontinued to gain places as we worked\nour way up the major climb of the day\ntowards the second checkpoint. By this\ntime I was genuinely struggling and the\nfinal 7 km of the day were very difficult\nindeed. The fears of non-completion\nwere foremost in my mind and motivation seemed hard to come by. The\nsight of the finish that day was most\nwelcomed and we struggled home, ecstatic that we had completed Day One\nand for a while thought nothing of the\ndays to come. Our position of 33rd of\n43 pairs in the men category after this\ntough day buoyed our spirits slightly\nas it seemed others had also found the\nroute difficult. We awoke on the second\nday aching and apprehensive of the day\nahead: 29.73 kilometres with 1947 meters climb and 1785 meters decent. The\nday began with a 6km slog up a gently\ninclined track to an Alpine hut, a section on which we held our own but had\nto work very hard. This was followed\nby a long high level traverse on tricky\nscree before a final, unexpected climb\nand a long gentle descent.\nOn the morning of the third day\nwe rose again, my body finally beginning to feel like it was recovering from\nthat misguided first 10km and ready\nto begin pushing itself again. The day\nahead looked like it would be a good\none for us as it included two massive\nascents with a total of 2437m of steep\nclimb. Our background as mountaineers meant that we were strong\non the uphills and this was where we\ngained most of our advantage \u2013 we\nwere ready for them today. The first\nclimb went very well and we were in\na good position as we came over the\nfirst col, particularly as the upper section was \u2018technical ground\u2019, something\nwith which we are very familiar. The\ndescent from this point was most enjoyable and we were soon working our\nway up the second climb, exhaustion\nbeginning to seep quietly into our mus-cles. Knowing we were on par with the\nfast runners pushed us up and over to\nthe long and gentle descent all the way\nto the valley floor and the finish. Our\ntired contentedness at completing the\nday as planned was rewarded handsomely with a 22nd place finish for the\nday \u2013 something we would never have\ndreamed off just three days previous.\nOur targets for the race began to rise\nagain as we contemplated the possibility of a top twenty finish.\nThe fourth day saw the race take a\nturn back towards the activities we\nwere more accustomed too as heavy\nsnowfall transformed the higher sections of the stage. The cold weather,\nheavy winds and falling snow seemed\nmore reminiscent of Scotland than\na summer in the Alps \u2013 something\nour competitors did not seem happy\nabout. Despite a slip on icy rocks and a\nslight sprained ankle, we were now in a\nrhythm and achieved a finish position\nof 25th for this day.\nWe were now halfway through the\nrace with an overall position which\nhad risen slowly to 23rd. The following\nday was the shortest stage at 6.19km\nand 936m of ascent and no descent.\nWe were hoping that this would be our\nday to get a good position. We weren\u2019t\nwrong as falling snow and a lot of hard\nwork left us finishing in just over one\nhour with a team position of 18th. Our\ntop 20 target was beginning to come\ninto sight.\nThe following two days saw us complete more than 70km and nearly\n3000m of ascent over more mountainous tracks and ever more snow including the highest point on the entire race\nat just over 3000m. Finishes of 23rd\nand 20th left us in an overall position of 21st with one day to go and a\nmere nine minutes behind the pair in\n20th. Our aim was clear and the final\n28.62 kilometres would be the stage\nthat mattered most, we had to win by\na clear 9 minutes.\nThe day began well and we reached\nthe first checkpoint in good time,\npushing ourselves to the limit as we\nwere aware the team we needed to beat\nwere still ahead of us. Our motivation\ntemporarily lapsed as we approached\nthe top of the final climb of the day,\naware that we had still not overtaken\nthe pair in front and also aware that we\nnormally lost ground on the downhills.\nStill, pushing ourselves ever onwards\nwe overtook just after the highest point\nand worked hard all the way down the\nhill, pushing ourselves harder than ever\nbefore as we knew the end was close.\nApproaching the finish we knew we\nwere ahead but not how much and so\na tense 9 minutes ensued. Before we\nknew it, we had done it- we had finished in the top twenty. Our ideas of\nvictory all those months ago had now\nbeen replaced by a lesser achievement\nthat still left us feeling fantastic. We\nheaded directly for the free beer tent\nand made ourselves at home. We had\nfinished the competition the youngest\nteam to enter and finish and also the\nhighest ranking British team in the\nmen\u2019s category. We can\u2019t wait to go\nback next year.\nBoth Joe and I are active\nmembers of the Outdoor Club\nand if you are interested in\nentering events like this either in\nthe UK or abroad we would love\nto meet you! E-mail outdoor@\nic.ac.uk for more details or come\nto one of our meetings which are\nheld every Tuesday at 12.30 in\ndB\u2019s.\nGore-Tex trans-alpine 2007, one hell of a race!\nNeil Dowse\nThe finish line, what a relief!\nSome guy running on snow, mental! How is he not cold?\nHaving been placed at the bottom of\nthe esteemed Felix sports team rank-ings, it was time to fight back. A slightly nervous 15 player squad walked\nout onto the Royal Holloway Sports\nGrounds in Egham on Wednesday 31st\nOctober. (I say nervous because of the\nLacrosse\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 7\nRoyal Holloway 1st 5\nwell-known fact that several players of\nthe opposition were American; trained\nin the States to a level that would give\nEngland lacrosse players a run for their\nlacrosse balls.)\nCaptaining the opposition was, nat-urally, one such American and as she\nconfidently marched over towards me\nfor the toss, she towered like Goliath\nwould have over David. Well, not quite-but hopefully you\u2019re getting the idea\nthat Holloway were a fearsome opposi-tion; and we the lowly underdogs.\nIn Lacrosse, matches are divided\nup into four fifteen-minute quar-ters, swapping ends at half-time (i.e.\na match lasts one hour, with three\nbreaks in play.) The first quarter went\nwell for the IC team, we executed some\ngreat plays down the field and our efforts were justly rewarded with a 3 goal\nadvantage.\nOur relatively inexperienced goal-Lacrosse\nImperial Mixed 1st 23\nRoyal Holloway Mixed 2nd 0\nLacrosse club on winning form\nOlivia Raglan\nkeeper Anna displayed some fantastic\nskill and held off most of the shots that\nthe opposition were blasting at her.\nHowever, by half-time Holloway had\nstarted to fight back and brought the\nscore back to 3-3. Shit.\nThe third quarter saw Holloway\ncontinue to take advantage of our momentary lapse in concentration and\nbrought the score to 5-4 (Holloway in\nthe lead). Having frustratingly lost our\nlast two matches, the IC ladies weren\u2019t\ngoing to let their brilliant skills and\nteam-work get trampled over again.\nWe fought back and the game saw\nsome phenomenal shooting by Izzie\nBrown and Sabina Barbur in attack\nto bring the final score to an Imperial\nwin, 7-5. A far over-due credit to the\ndetermination of our girls.\nThe dismayed expression on the Holloway faces as we left victorious will be\nremembered for many weeks to come,\nor at least until we face them again\nat home in Harlington on December\n5th\u2026\nAnd to continue with the success of\nthe Imperial Lacrosse Club this week: a\nbig congratulations to the Mixed team\nwho remain undefeated this season\nas they continue to defend their ULU\nChampion title from last year, winning\ntheir last match on Sunday 4th November with a storming score of 23-0\nagainst Royal Holloway.\nLacrosse ladies team posing after a well earned victory\n\n"

Apathy comes\nfrom the good old Greeks\nand the word apathes\nmeans \u2018without feeling\u2019.\nYou probably knew this so what is the\npoint in me reiterating it? Well, the\nwords without feeling pretty much say\ndeath to me. There is definitely a dramatic overtone in that sentence but I\ndo not think it is fiction.\nI have been thinking a lot about such\nthings recently since visiting my grandmother and seeing her in what is effectively the final stage in her life. Aside\nfrom all the personal feelings about her\nin that condition, I was left with what\ncan be called, context. It put my own\natheistic beliefs and her Roman Catholic beliefs into context.\nThroughout history, the amount of\nchoice and the ability to make educated choices have both increased (as a\nresult of science). Even in the couple of\ngenerations between my grandmother\nand myself I can see how many more\nchoices I have open to me compared to\nher limited opportunities. My grandmother was an immigrant and her life\nwas occupied with finding work, working and then raising children; time for\nleisure was limited and time for contemplating existence was (ironically)\nnon-existent. Also one great feature\nin her life is her Roman Catholicism;\nfrom the certainty it gives her and the\nsupport it has given her throughout\nher life (through the church communities she belonged to primarily).\nHow is this relevant to apathy you\nmay ask? Well, I think also throughout history, wilful apathy has also in-creased. One could say that apathy has\nbeen glorified in culture as pro-active\npeople are seen as threatening. However, it is probably down to the increase in comfort (the famous adage\nthat society is three meals away from\nrevolution) and thus the increase in\nchoices; it is natural to feel indifferent\nwhen many different paths are open to\nyou. Again my grandmother\u2019s immediate needs for stability impassioned her\nCatholicism as something she needed\nand the certainty it gave her.\nNow, as I see myself in comfort\nwith a variety of choices open to me\nto which she contributed, it would do\nher a disservice to be indifferent. Of\ncourse, there is the choice to be apa-thetic, but surely pro-active apathy is a\nwaste of thinking energy. I want to use\nmy choices to oppose those elements\nthat move society away from secular-ism, because allowing religious groups\nto influence society, I believe, is wrong\nand I\u2019m sure many will agree with me; it\ncan only move society back to the situations that my grandmother strived to\nmove out of. Alongside this, just as she\nwas supported by her church, I believe\nthere should be support for those who\nchoose to live without religion.\nI wanted to write this short column\nto promote the Atheist and Agnostic Society that has been formed not\nby saying that God does not exist (he\ndoesn\u2019t, by the way) but by saying that\nby doing something about the choices\nyou have, you reassert your position\nin history as the benefactors of great\nchange and want to give something\nback. Please get in touch if you want to\nget involved.\nA\ns you may have noticed,\nthe idea of this column\nis to give Felix readers a\npicture of how life varies\nacross of Imperial halls\nof residence. Unofficially, it also gives\nwardens a place to offer a piece of their\nmind to the general student population\nabout a topic particularly close to their\nheart. Hence, given Piccadilly Court is\nin Islington/Camden/sticks, depending who you ask, today I would like to\nsay a few words about location.\nBe honest now, whenever you were\napplying to come to Imperial, did you\nput \u201clife in South Kensington\u201d as one of\nyour main priorities? Can\u2019t live without\na French pattisserie next door? Exclusive dietary requirement of Harrods\u2019\nbaked beans? Or were you excited by\nthe prospect of coming to a world-leading centre of academic excellence\nto get the best out of yourselves, find a\ncareer that stimulates you and embark\non it, confident in knowing that you\nare at the right place for it.\nDo not get me wrong, I am not calling anyone spoiled for wanting to live\nnext door to College, however it still\namazes me to what lengths people are\nprepared to go, only to ensure that if\nthey fall out of bed at 8.58, they will\nhave rolled down the steps into their\nlecture room by 9.00. Medical cases\nthat cannot go to sleep unless they are\nsafe knowing three major museums are\nwatching over them? Eager sports fans\nwhose gruelling tiddly-winks training\nregime is suffering due to their extra\ntravel? Female Alcohol Appreciation\nSociety (yes, seriously) members who\nare regularly refused entry to night\nbuses and are thus discriminated\nagainst if placed outside South Ken?\nThis is London. A glorious, ramshackle collection of villages and towns\nwhich grew into each other over centuries producing a metropolis unrivalled\nin the Western world. As a conse-quence, once you move out of the halls,\nyou are highly unlikely to find anything\naffordable within its centre, which\nmeans saying goodbye to Boujis and\nHarvey Nicks and trying to figure out\njust where on the tube map Hackney is.\nIt may sound cruel, however the earlier\nyou embrace the many communities of\nLondon, the easier it will be to decide\nwhere you want your next home to be.\nThe difference between studying at\nImperial and studying at Oxbridge, is\nthat London does not provide you with\na sheltered, isolated community that\nis happy to ignore the world outside.\nOver here, you are expected to create\nyour own niche within the bigger setting of the city, and learn to enjoy the\nadvantages of such a setting. At Piccadilly Court we traditionally strive to organize events and outings in Islington\nso as to make students appreciate what\nit has to offer. Other halls do the same.\nOne of the valuable lessons that university teaches students is how to live\nwith others on the course and in the\nhall. The exact same principle applies\nto your neighbourhood, be it Paddington, Ealing, Islington or Chelsea, so get\nthe most out of it. Even if Harrods does\nnot deliver there.\nApproaching the quarter-life crisis\nI\n\u2019m not adjusting very well to\njoiningtheranksoftwentysome-things, it\u2019s true. Just a few years/\nmonths/weeks/days ago now, I\nleft the years of teenagerhood\nbehind me, and began the journey towards Radio 2, wearing short-sleeved\nshirts non-ironically and eating Brie.\nI barely know what Brie is, and I have\nnightmares where people ask me what\nwine to drink with it and I pronounce\n\u2018rioja\u2019 wrong.\nNot that this has changed the routine\nI\u2019ve got into of wake up, have fruit-and-fibre, walk to soul-dissolving lectures,\ndie a little inside and go home for tea.\nWhat it has done, rather unhelpfully,\nis make the impending graduation I\u2019m\nin a staring contest with slightly less-appealing than fellating the Rector on\nnational television.\nWhen we all arrived at Imperial,\nfresh-faced and full of bullshit gap year\nstories, the plan was simple - party\nhard and study later. Fuck yes.\nAnyway, a week later when everyone had lost enthusiasm and seemed\nto be going to the union out of a sense\nof duty more than anything else, this\ndull kind of stupor descends and you\nfind yourself performing a daily cycle of courseworks and having lunch\nwith your vapid, internship-seeking\n\u201cfriends\u201d.\nFor the first year, incidentally, this\nseems great fun and you feel really\nbloody mature, but like Heroes, relationships with English women and\nmilk, give it twelve months or so\nand you\u2019ll notice things go considerably downhill, where you wake up one\nmorning tongue-deep in the rear end\nof graduate recruitment schemes, and\nyou notice your boss is some prick who\nleft your school at sixteen to the sound\nof you mocking him. Good move.\nAnyway, I\u2019m somewhere between\nthose two states of mind right now,\nconsidering the possibility of just\ntossing my sanity down the drain in\nexchange for a wife, two kids and a\nnine-to-five, probably resulting in a\ncombination of the Columbine massacre and an episode of the Office. And\nyet, at the same time, I\u2019m still clinging on to the idea that I\u2019m young, I\u2019m\na student in a fine university, and that\nmy dreams are still there to be chased.\nDespite this, every success story in the\nnews normally contains the sentence\n\u201cthe magic started in his/her teens\u201d\nand given that the only magic I can\nthink of involved me winning a fiver\nin a packet of Walkers\u2019 crisps, which\nprobably doesn\u2019t qualify me for an\nobituary in The Times, I guess the only\nhope for me is to learn to use the word\n\u201cprofitability\u201d in a sentence and try my\nhand at entrepreneurship like the rest\nof the depressed fame-chasers in my\ngodforsaken department.\nIs my thirst to be someone a bad\nthing? Is that why the idea of actually\nsubmitting my CV to someone seems\nso awful? Or is it because jobs, like age,\nsignal that preparation time is over, and\nanything you aren\u2019t ready for is just a\nsymptom of your own incompetence?\nSure, there are grey-haired lunatics who retrained at the age of three\nhundred to become exotic dancers or\nwhatever, but I\u2019m not sure the world itself is going to last long enough for me\nto turn things around late in the day,\nand I\u2019m pretty sure my coffee-addled,\nstress-wrecked body will refuse point\nblank.\nI guess we\u2019ll see how things go. Fortunately for me, I\u2019ve got time to kill.\nFor you poor sods who are facing the\nbig wide world of careers fairs and job\napplications, I feel for you. But don\u2019t\nworry, because I\u2019ll get mine in a year\nor so, when you\u2019re the one in the suit,\nstaring down at me and cackling as\nyou offer a free pen and the promise of\n\u2018networking\u2019.\nUntil then, I\u2019m off to write my award-winning novel and draft the film adap-tation, possibly beginning my career\npath in amateur photography at the\nsame time. See you in twelve months,\nguys. I\u2019ve got my \u2018fuck you\u2019 cover letter\nready and waiting.\nA.

Here\u2019s an introduction to some common types of\ninjuries and how best to treat them.\nAn acute injury is damage to the\nsoft tissues i.e. muscle, tendon or liga-ment. Immediately after the injury\nthe tissues will be bleeding and subsequent inflammation will be taking\nplace in the local area causing pain and\ndysfunction.\nA strain is an injury to either a muscle or a tendon. Depending on the\nseverity of the injury, a strain may be\na simple overstretch of the muscle or\ntendon, or it can result from a partial\nor complete tear.\nA sprain is an injury to a ligament\nsupporting a joint and can result from\na fall, a sudden twist, or a blow to the\nbody that forces a joint out of its normal position and stretches or tears the\nligament supporting that joint.\nOften you may exhibit symptoms\nthat suggest an injury (strain/sprain);\nhowever this can be as a result of tightened muscles pulling other structures\nout of alignment, causing referred pain.\nIn this case these symptoms can often\nbe effectively released by following a\nstretch plan or massage treatment.\nWherever possible aim to PROTECT\nvulnerable body parts when participating in a sport, but when this does not\nhappen or does not prevent injury the\nfollowing information is crucial.\nDuring the first 48 hours following\nan injury a magical process known as\n\u2018RICE\u2019 should be applied. Its effectiveness in reducing pain and inflammation should not be underestimated,\nhence its \u2018magical\u2019 tag line!\nR = Rest\nTo prevent further immediate\ndamage to the affected tissues\nand allow the healing process to\nbegin.\nI = Ice (cold)\nTo reduce pain and local muscle\nspasm by numbing the pain re-ceptors. Stops internal bleeding\nby slowing down blood circula-tion, which in-turn reduces the\namount of bleeding and inflammation in the tissues. Ice time:\ndependant on size of structure\ninjured. Skin should look pale\nand not reddened when ice is\nremoved.\nC = Compression\nCompress for support and to\ncontrol inflammation, which\nfurther helps with pain relief.\nE = Elevation\nTo help decrease bleeding and\ninflammation.\nDuring this period you may well require additional pain relief such as an-ti-inflammatory gels or non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID\u2019s).\nPlease consult your pharmacist for appropriate treatment.\nAfter approx. 48 hours:\nRehabilitation\nOncethepainandinflammationhave\ngone, exercises to regain lost strength\nand mobility can begin. If these symptoms re-occur during this process stop\nexercises and return to RICE until it is\nagain safe to return to the rehabilitation phase.\nAs a sports-person is not always likely to follow the rest component of this\nprocess due to training requirements,\ncompetition and sometimes just plain\nfoolhardiness (you know who you are),\nthe injured person should at least exercise with caution and try to follow the\nI-C-E part of this procedure, followed\nby rehabilitation.\n\u2022 Heat is not appropriate for first\naid of an injury. It increases bleeding\nwithin the tissue exacerbating inflam-mation. Only apply heat in recovery\nphases.\nActive Rehabilitation\nSports-individuals willing to stop\ntraining and competition altogether\nare few and far between. Obviously\nthis is dependant on the severity of the\ninjury i.e. a ruptured ligament/tendon/\nmuscle would be impossible not to rest\nas the pain would prevent any unrea-sonable, but desired premature return\nto sport.\nHowever many injuries, although\npainful and debilitating in terms of\nperformance, will not necessarily prevent participation. If this is the sportsperson\u2019s choice (it may not be recommended by a sports therapist) then it\nis important to give yourself a fighting\nchance. With this in mind, injury articles to follow will provide suggestions\non exercises to help during the recovery process, but they should not be attempted until pain and inflammation\nhas gone, which would be at least 48\nhours afterward.\nIt is important to note that these are\nonly guidelines based on a minor acute\nepisode, and in no way replace the\nrole of a qualified physician/therapist.\nIf your condition does not improve\nover the 48-hour period, it is strongly\nadvised that you consult a qualified\ntherapist. Your injury may be worse\nthan a strain or sprain, and these type\nof injuries, if not given correct treatment immediately after the event, can\nbecome a chronic problem and this is\nsomething you should strive to avoid.\nWeek 6 and a lot more results are in.\nThe ranking of the teams is based on\nthe Felix Index (FI), which is calculated\nas follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) \u2013 (L*4).\nOnly teams with 5 games or more will\nbe considered in the overall championship at the end of year.\nWith this week\u2019s results in, Netball 1st, Squash Men\u2019s 1st (this week\u2019s\nTeam of the Week) and Tennis Men\u2019s\n2nd are top of the table with 20 points\neach, followed closely by Hockey Men\u2019s\n1st and Rugby Men\u2019s 1st.\nAt the bottom of the table we find\nFootball Men\u2019s 2nd still rooted to the\nbottom, having not won a game yet.\nACROSS\n1 Man of the cloth (6)\n4 Cry, male puppy (3)\n7 Tangled snake in a bathhouse (3)\n8 The crib in the cottage (3)\n9 Yeast with thorium gains depth(7)\n10 Walk shakily after lively dance (4)\n12 One skull goes forward (5)\n14 Notice point (4)\n15 Slow at the beginning, with some\nthought, leads to laziness (4)\n18 Entice a teetotaller to take some\nhemp (5)\n20 Sprite on a donkey from the East\nenters a cul-de-sac (7)\n21 Mop bristle head at the front of the\nroom (5)\n22 Straight-edge leader (5)\n23 Expression in favour of an action\nword (7)\n24 Parasite loses anger about rice (5)\n26 In that robe, seem overweight (5)\n29 Hit a target spike (4)\n30 At the beginning, we all liked to\nzanily dance (5)\n32 Fever takes the head of a sickness\n(4)\n33 Antiquated letter (7)\n35 At the signal, cutie loses it (3)\n36 Beer in a leaky barrel (3)\n37 Grain sounds drily humorous (3)\nThe winner of Enoch\u2019s sublime crossword last week is Benjamin Martin.\nCongratulations that man.

However, this is simply un-true. Mostly.\nImperial College Boat Club has spent\nthe past month slowly lulling its new\nmembers into a false sense of security\nby organising vaguely \u2018rowing-themed\u2019\nparties and supplying a multitude of\nalcoholic beverages. The season kicked\noff in the first week with a fresher\u2019s\ntaster session, involving a short row\nfrom IC\u2019s Putney boathouse, followed\nby beers and a barbeque on the club\u2019s\nbalcony overlooking the Thames. The\nevening was completed with a recruitment push to South Kensington\u2019s finest drinking establishment: IC Union.\nSocial Secretary Adam Freeman-Pask\ntook the lead with his \u2018active recruitment\u2019 techniques, which involved encouraging willing victims to consume\nfrom a \u20183 and a half pint\u2019 oar.\nThe Boatclub \u2018All-You-Can-Drink\nImperial rowers annihilate University of London\nIain Palmer\nFor the senior squad, the first month\u2019s\ntraining of the year culminated last\nweekend in \u2018Fours Head\u2019, the third-big-gest race of the year, on the Thames between Chiswick and Putney. The event\nhad a total of more than 500 boats rac-ing, with Imperial entering eight boats.\nOf these, the top boat (a senior 1 quad)\nwon its event in style, finishing 6th\noverall among world-class opposition.\nSubsequently mentioned strokeman\nAdam Freeman-Pask found it \u201cdifficult\nto keep it long and hard for the whole\n19 minutes, and the last few strokes really finished me off.\u201d\nThe top women\u2019s quad placed fourth\nout of 39 in their highly competitive\nevent, whilst the 1st and 2nd men\u2019s\ncoxed fours both came close seconds\nin their events, putting all 3 boats in a\ngood position to move on from during\nthe rest of the term. Three other men\u2019s\nToga Party\u2019 happily coincided with\nEngland\u2019s Rugby World Cup victory\nover France, thus setting up the night\nperfectly for the many who were in at-tendance. The combination of sporting victory, togas and unlimited booze\nmade for an (if you will forgive the\nmild hyperbole) epic party, the events\nof which will not be printed on the respectable pages of Felix. It is safe to say\nhowever, for those who had to train at\n7am, the following morning was suitably painful.\nTo finish off the \u2018Fresher\u2019s Month\u2019,\na \u2018Splash, Dash and, er\u2026.Get Lashed\u2019\nevent was held on the last Sunday of\nOctober, with the magical combination of fancy dress, rowing on the\nThames and beers (not necessarily in\nthat order). The day gave a first taste\nof racing to our new freshers, most of\nwhom have not rowed before coming\nto Imperial. This leads me briefly to\nthe training; since around two-thirds\nof our new members have never rowed\nbefore, there is a steep learning curve\nin the coming months.\nboats and a second women\u2019s quad also\nhad excellent races, finishing high. All\nIC crews overtook those ahead of them\nand, according to Tom Sutherland\n(mid-race to Cambridge Uni Lightweights), \u201cif you\u2019re that slow, you don\u2019t\ndeserve the racing line!\u201d\nIn his pre-race speech, head coach\nSimon Cox emphasised the need to\nbetter University of London Boat Club\nin the final results, stating (with tongue\nfirmly in cheek), \u201cif they die, they die.\u201d\nMeanwhile: the social side...\nCrucially, every Imperial College boat\nbeat its equivalent University of London boat, comprehensively. While UL\nhas had pretensions in the past as being the best student boat-club on the\nThames, IC has been able to shatter\ntheir illusions in the same year as Imperial declared its independence from\nUL. In the words of Ole Tietz, club\ncaptain and stroke of the top IC four,\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that these people know\nwe are not f***ing around!\u201d\nEvent Position\nIC I Men\u2019s senior 1 quads 1st\nIC II Men\u2019s senior 2 quads 11th\nIC III (Overall position) 164th\nIC IV Men\u2019s senior 2 coxed fours 2nd\nIC V Men\u2019s senior 3 (academic) coxed fours 2nd\nIC VI Men\u2019s senior 3 (academic) coxed fours 12th\nIC VII Women\u2019s senior 2 quads 4th\nIC VIII Women\u2019s senior 2 quads 28th\nIC Medics I Men\u2019s senior 3 (academic) coxed fours 30th\nRugby and togas, nice combination\nWomen\u2019s quad ICVII\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 9 November 2007 felix\nArts\nPop goes the portraits. Literally\nEmily Wilson pops into the National Portrait Gallery for a bite to eat and a Pop Art portrait or two...\nI\nt\u2019s easy to forget about the National Portrait Gallery, tucked\naway as it is behind the better\nknown National Gallery at Trafalgar Square. But now is the\nideal time to visit the main collections\nwhile you\u2019re popping in for Pop Art\nPortraits, the major exhibition running\nuntil 20th January 2008.\nI hadn\u2019t been to the National Portrait\nGallery since the long-ago days of my\nchildhood. All I could remember about\nit was it being small, slightly cramped\nand full of... well... portraits. The NPG,\nupon more recent inspection, is still\nsmall and slightly cramped, but has\nobviously had lashings of National\nLottery money thrown at it since my\nlast visit. The building\u2019s been modernized to within an inch of its life but still\nretains an awkward layout that\u2019s difficult to navigate. This isn\u2019t helped by\na lack of signs and maps as you walk\nin. Most museums and art galleries\ndisplay their floor plans somewhere\naround their entrances, but evidently\nthe NPG hasn\u2019t thought to do so. Even\nthe hand-out maps are a challenge to\nfind (keep walking forwards from the\nentrance, and they\u2019re hidden amongst\nother leaflets on the ticket desk).\nThe first thing I went looking for,\nI\u2019ll admit, was the cafe. My quest for\ncaffeination led me on a grand tour\nof the museum before finding the cafe\nhidden in the lower basement behind\nthe bookshop (of course?). It\u2019s not for\nthe claustrophobic \u2013 the seating is in a\nlong narrow area surrounded by concrete and bricks, and the only windows\nto the outside world are above your\nhead. But it was impeccably clean,\nwith the tables being cleared instantly.\nThe menu was varied and high quality,\nthough possibly tending to the wanky\nside. Goats cheese quiche, anybody?\nIt wasn\u2019t cheap but they had offers\non breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea\ndepending on the time. I ordered a\nlarge cappuccino and a piece of coffee\ncake. The cappuccino wasn\u2019t my idea\nof large, but it came with real flakes of\nchocolate on top. My coffee cake was\nwankified by mascarpone and some\nother equally sloaney ingredient, but it\nwas good cake nonetheless \u2013 light and\nfluffy with creamy icing. But putting\nmascarpone in the icing did make it\na bit cheesy. It\u2019s not a fucking cheese-cake, people. It\u2019s a coffee-walnut cake.\nLeave it alone!\nThe National Portrait Gallery and\nits permanent collections made for a\nthoroughly enjoyable afternoon out.\nIt was quiet considering it was a half-term Saturday, and the museum was\ngenerally calming and pleasant to meander through. The main exhibits are\nunexpectedly large and varied, with\nevery famous figure imaginable from\nthe Tudor era to modern day. The galleries are well laid out (once you\u2019ve\nfound a map), generally chronologically arranged but incorporating smaller\nrooms that focus on certain aspects\nof history, for example \u2018Romanticism\u2019,\n\u2018Science and Technology\u2019 and \u2018from\nRevolution to Reform\u2019. This makes it\neasy to find the portraits that closest\nmatch your interests: Poetry buffs can\nsee Keats, Burns, Clare, Wordsworth\nand Shelley; Budding scientists can\ncome face to face with William Harvey,\nRobert Boyle, Michael Faraday, Joseph\nLister, Charles Darwin, Sir Alexander\nFleming and T.H. Huxley; and for all\nyou abundant feminists at Imperial\nthere\u2019s Mary Wollstonecraft, Emmeline Pankhurst, Amy Johnson and Virginia Woolf. There\u2019s somebody for everybody and I could quite easily go on...\nOh, by the way, the only room I would\nNOT recommend was the Diana Princess of Wales room. It was nauseating.\nLet\u2019s get down to business: Pop Art\nPortraits. For those who don\u2019t know,\npop art was a visual arts movement\nof the mid twentieth century. Largely\nAmerican, the movement was inspired\nby the international trends towards\nmass culture, consumerism and ad-vertising. Many pop art pieces feature\nimages of famous people and famous\nbrands, like Marilyn Monroe and the\nCampbell\u2019s soup cans made iconic by\nAndy Warhol. Alongside Warhol, famous names in the movement include\nRoy Lichtenstein, Keith Haring, Eduardo Paolozzi and David Hockney. Pop\nart generally involves solid blocks of\nvivid colour, crisp lines, simple shapes\nand plenty of collage. Looking at pop\nart is often like looking at a comic\nbook. It\u2019s funky, kitschy and it targets\nthe masses.\nMy press ticket was presented to\nme paper-clipped to a smug wadge of\npress handouts which included, among\ninformation about events I have no intention of ever attending, a Eduardo\nPaolozzi postcard and a Pop Art Portraits bookmark. How kind! However,\nthey didn\u2019t bother to give me the free\nguide to the exhibition that everybody\nelse was walking round with. Due to\nthis, and the complete lack of information provided inside the exhibition it-self, I was forced to depend on my own\nlimited art history knowledge and raw\nobservation to try and figure out what\nwas going on. I found this difficult.\nSome of the works in the exhibition\ndidn\u2019t seem very pop art-esque, and\nsome simply weren\u2019t portraits. \u201cAstronaut 4\u201d by Gerald Land, for example,\nwas an oddly shaped creation involving\npolkadots and an astronaut\u2019s helmet.\nDoes that count as a portrait? Equally,\n\u201cTrophy V\u201d by Robert Rauschenberg\nis a canvas with some grey and cream\npaint slapped about, a cardboard box\nglued on, and some kind of metal window through it. Where is the portrait?\nAnd where\u2019s the pop art?\nAmong the first pieces to be seen as\nyou enter the exhibition are some very\nlikable collages by Ray Johnson and\nEduardo Paolozzi, mostly depicting\n1950s home scenes. They make you\nwant to hack up some Good Housekeeping magazines and create your\nown funky masterpieces. Later on,\n\u201cMan Playing Snooker and Thinking\nof Other Things\u201d by Derek Boshier\nwas another delight: a happy jumble of\nbold green background, bright abstract\nshapes and the occasional interjection\nof words such as \u201cI hate you! (yea you!)\u201d.\nThe self portrait by Andy Warhol used\nin the promotional posters around\nLondon is possibly my favourite in\nthe exhibition. The flat use of grey\nisn\u2019t something you expect from pop\nart, but it remains true to the movement with its simple outlines and the\nbright green splotches for eyes. I also\nloved the ice-creams and milkshakes\npositioned in a row in front of a gelatinous blob of a naked woman in \u201cGreat\nAmerican Nude Number #27\u201d by Tom\nWesselman. Another painting worth\nseeing is \u201cInteresting Journey\u201d by Allen Jones. Had I been given the guide\nI might have been able to find out if it\nwas supposed to be Prince Charles\u2019s\nhead and three hamburgers, or if it was\njust me being over-creative.\nThere were a couple of different\nexamples of pop art sculpture including one in the last room called \u201cGhost\nWardrobe for MM\u201d by Claes Oldenburg. It was string hung off a metal\nrail to look like clothing. I didn\u2019t get it.\nIt looked like a wardrobe, sure, but it\nwas... string. Once again, neither proper art nor a portrait, and it wasn\u2019t even\nnice to look at. In the same room was\n\u201cMM\u201d by Richard Smith, some orange\npaint streaked across a canvas. I\u2019m not\nsaying it isn\u2019t art, but it ain\u2019t pop art\nand it sure ain\u2019t a portrait. Nearby were\nthe Marilyn Monroes made famous by\nAndy Warhol. They\u2019re iconic but at the\nsame time they felt overexposed and\ncliched to me. Pity, because they\u2019re\nbig and beautiful with some astounding use of colours, both complementary and clashing. It was at this point\nin the room that it dawned on me that\nMM stood for Marilyn Monroe, and\nthe whole room was of art dedicated\nto her. Why not highlight this fact on\nsome kind of sign?? The best piece\nin the room was \u201cMarilyn\u201d by Allan\nD\u2019Arcangelo \u2013 a cut out and assemble\nMarilyn with a pair of metal scissors\nhanging off by a string. The crisp lines\nand vivid colours were classic pop art,\nand the concept was good fun.\nWhen I think of pop art, I think of\nRoy Lichtenstein. So I was surprised\nto see only one example of his well-known work, \u201cIn the Car\u201d. It wasn\u2019t\neven a painting I recognized. Surely\nthis figurehead of the movement deserves more representation in this major exhibition? I suspect no other art\ninstitutions (the Tate springs to mind\n\u2013 they have a few Lichtensteins knocking about) were willing to lend out\ntheir prized possessions to the NPG.\nThat was a shame. Also, there was one\ntoken David Hockney but it wasn\u2019t a\ngood one.\nOverall I\u2019d say the absence of any annotation or written guidance around\nthe art was the major problem with the\nexhibition. All the other major museums offer such information, and the\nNPG did have it in their main galleries,\nso I can\u2019t understand the lack in this\ncase. It definitely lessened my enjoyment of \u2018Pop Art Portraits\u2019, so make\nsure you nab one before you go in! I\nwas also disappointed by the selection\nof art on offer \u2013 some expected favourites were absent and some of the paintings present seemed irrelevant. It didn\u2019t\nseem like proper representation of the\ntheme \u201cPop Art Portraits\u201d. It certainly\nwasn\u2019t much of an introduction to anybody not already familiar with pop art.\nDon\u2019t let me put you off the National\nPortrait Gallery in general \u2013 I\u2019d recommend it to everybody as a relaxing and\nenjoyable afternoon out. Where else\ncan you rub shoulders with so many\ninspirational thinkers of the past and\npresent? But perhaps Pop Art Portraits\nis better left to the art enthusiasts.\nWhy don\u2019t you pop into the\nPop Art Portrait exhibiton? It\u2019s\non until the 20th January 2008.\nRemember to pass on the \u2018wankified\u2019 mascarpone cake. (What a\nword, Emily! That\u2019s going in my\nvocabulary right now.)\nObviously this is Prince Charles and 3 hamburgers. What else could it\nPOSSIBLY be?! (Answers on a postcard to the usual address)\nINTERESTING JOURNEY BY ALLEN JONES, 1962\n\u00a9 ALLEN JONES\nQuite simply, I want this lounge. Especially that spam.

Although\nthe explosions were (most probably)\nfireworks, the thought of gunfire and\nstreet crime came flooding back to me.\nLast time I came to Brixton, I was being chased through the streets wearing\na lab coat. I went to see We Are Scientists, if you are wondering.\nThis time, however, I was here to see\nAsh, the trio from Northern Ireland.\nAs I entered the academy, I checked\nmy pockets, and all of my possessions\nwere still present and accounted for. I\nhadn\u2019t been mugged, chased, or threat-ened, and was lulling myself into a false\nsense of security.\nNevertheless, when Ash stepped\nonto the stage, and just after the opening riffs to the title track of their latest \u2013 and final \u2013 album were heard, I\nwas crushed against the metal barriers separating myself and the band by\nmere metres. And by crushed, I mean\nsuffered severe internal bleeding of the\nstomach, lungs and kidneys. Despite\nbeing through some tough times in the\nband\u2019s history, most recently involving the discharge of their pianist and\nsecond guitarist Charlotte Hatherley,\nit seems Ash\u2019s fan base remains as diehard and as strong in numbers as ever.\nTo be perfectly honest with you, I\nonly have Ash\u2019s most recent album,\n\u201cTwilight of the Innocents\u201d, which I\nacquired after hearing samples from it\nat Snow Patrol\u2019s recent O2 Arena gigs,\nwhere Ash were called in as the prime\nsupport act. It was everything I looked\nfor in an album, and decided very soon\nafterwards to go and see them perform\nmore of their material.\nThis isn\u2019t to say I haven\u2019t ever heard\nsome of Ash\u2019s older tracks. As soon as\n\u201cOrpheus\u201d kicked into life, I wasn\u2019t the\nonly one leaping against the barriers \u2013\nthe entire building burst into ecstasy\nas the thundering bass line and heavy\nduty drum work lay down the foundations for frontman Tim Wheeler\u2019s\nexcellent winding guitar and soaring\nvocals.\nAnother seemingly-legendary track\n\u2013 by the fans\u2019 standards, at least \u2013 was\n\u201cKung Fu\u201d, which was as intense as the\nmartial art it is named after. On several of the songs, including this one,\nthe band wisely and very pleasingly extended the instrumental section, giving\nthe crowd a little more mosh for their\nmoney. Even the marginally slower\ntracks, including \u201cShining Light\u201d, were\nstill far more of an adrenaline rush than\nyour average indie band garble.\nOf course, Ash is not an indie band.\nThey might have been once, but as\nmost indie bands nowadays are not\nallowed to be called \u2018indie\u2019 unless less\nGolden oldies Ash are running up against the eye-candy of the new lady on the block, Bat For Lashes in this\nweek\u2019s music section. Ash come out favourably however, managing to get five truly coveted Felix stars\nKnowing Bat For Lashes\u2019 deep fascination with whatever falls in between\ndreams, the subconscious and spir-itualism, it was no surprise to walk\ninto Koko\u2019s richly opulent interior and\nseeing the stage looking like it had\nbeen decorated by Tim Burton\u2019s set\ndesigner. With glittering, golden trees\nadorning strange symbols, an inky\nblack curtain holding up twinkling\nfairy lights and a full moon displaying\nstarchy Native American projections,\nyou wouldn\u2019t be blamed for thinking\nthat you had stepped into some kind of\npagan ritual.\nLooking like forest nymphs, the\nmusicians walked on stage as Natasha\nKahn opened her set with a whispery\nFrench incantation that silenced an already highly attentive crowd \u2013 one that\ncheered uproariously as the pulsing\nbass to the gorgeous \u201cTrophy\u201d kicks in.\nIt was a bewitching experience: Lizzy\nCarey and Abi Fry were perfect on\ntheir violas, the string section was rich\nagainst the subtle gusts of the brass\nwhile Caroline Weeks\u2019 guitar gurgled\nunder Kahn\u2019s breathy vocals. \u201cI Saw A\nLight\u201d almost became an early highlight as it demonstrated Kahn\u2019s emo-tive, Bj\u00f6rk-esque wails over a rousing\ncrescendo.\nApart from a strangely hollowed\nrendition of \u201cWhat\u2019s A Girl To Do?\u201d in\nwhich its deeper sounds were replaced\nby weak synth washes, nearly every\ntrack sounded better than their album\ncounterpart. This is especially true of\n\u201cSarah\u201d \u2013 a maudlin track on record,\nbut reduced to a minimalist nightmare\nas Kahn beats the floor with a totem\npole (\u201cMy beautiful new stick!\u201d) to give\na vicious beat against a disjointed and\nscreeching electric guitar.\nThe best performance, however, was\na cover of Tom Waits\u2019 \u201cLonely\u201d. Originally a low key piano track from when\nhis voice didn\u2019t sound like a forty-fags-a-day growl, it was given a full orchestral arrangement replete with string\nswells, blasts of French horns and a\nstunning flute arrangement that was\nseemingly pulled out of Kahn\u2019s bottomless magician\u2019s hat.\nThroughout, she remained a perfectly welcoming hostess, making conversation with the crowd and inviting\nsupporting act Spleen back on stage\nto provide beat-boxing duties on one\nof the tracks (to a distractingly disappointing effect it has to be said \u2013 either\nhis mike was too low, or it was a really\nhalf-arsed effort). The atmosphere was\nkept at a lightly eerie tone and amid her\nnocturnal ballads (and especially when\nshe invited the crowd to howl at the\nmoon), you can\u2019t help thinking that if\neveryone in the audience was dressed\nup, this would have been one hell of a\nsurreal Halloween party.\nJorge Costa\nAsh\nBrixton Academy\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nLive Review\nthan one thousand people have heard\nof them, Ash\u2019s sizeable fan base clearly\nremoves them from this ridiculous category and puts them squarely in the\nambiguous \u2018alternative rock\u2019 section.\nPerhaps this is why I am such a fan of\ntheir latest album as opposed to \u201c1977\u201d\nor \u201cFree All Angels\u201d. Every track they\nperformed before my melting eyes\nfrom their collection of older LPs were\nstorming, thundering, explosive, pow-erful, and of course, incredibly memo-rable. Still, there is something about\ntheir most recent album which puts it\nup their next to the best in alternative\nrock.\nDespite not playing \u201cPrincess Six\u201d \u2013 a\ntale of love lost in a metaphor of royal-ty, accompanied by a sparky lead guitar\n\u2013 all of their best tracks from Twilight\nof the Innocents were played amidst\nthe smorgasbord of old singles and\nlong-time fan favourites. \u201cYou Can\u2019t\nHave It All\u201d, which contains arguably\none of the best bass tracks of recent\ntimes, debuted first, and heads were\nsimultaneously banging away. \u201cBlacklisted and Ritual\u201d soon followed, both\nof which allowed a mix of Wheeler\u2019s\nvocals and the brilliant drumming of\nRick McMurray to produce the miniature epics. Of course, this was but a\ntaster of what was to follow.\n\u201cPolaris\u201d, a song seemingly about war,\nhas a string section sample accompanying another excellent bass line by Mark\nHamilton and of course the superb\nguitar riffs of Wheeler. With the darker\nsubject matter and the amazingly harmonious instrumentality produced by\nthe trio, this track could easily be part\nof a thought-provoking motion picture\nsoundtrack. Nevertheless, even this is\ndwarfed by the sheer scope of the titular track, which uses string, piano and\nglockenspiel samples, along with Ash\u2019s\ntrinity of extremely talented musicians,\nto convey such an epic composition\nit sounds as if it should belong to the\nclimax of piece of cinematic genius.\nThe song appears to tell the story of a\nperson trapped in a post-apocalyptic\nworld and how he seems to be dealing\nwith both the conflict across the planet and the internal conflicts he faces\nwithin himself.\nThe introspective lyrics and stunning\nvocals, along with an utterly jaw-drop-ping, emotive orchestral theme and the\nrepeated lyric \u201cI\u2019m still breathing; my\nheart\u2019s still beating\u201d allows the track to\nexude a sense of both mystery and epic\nBat For Lashes\nKoko\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nLive Review\nROBIN ANDREWS\ngrandeur, and is personally one of my\nfavourite songs of all time.\nInterestingly enough, the track\u2019s lyrical content appears to share stark similarities with the central character from\nNeon Genesis Evangelion, the most\ninfluential and critically-acclaimed\nanime series ever made. Being a huge\nfan of this particular series and of Ash,\nthis meant I had very high expectations when it came to this particular\ntrack. Performed live, it connected the\naudience to the band and each other in\na way few other songs can. I was not\ndisappointed in the slightest.\nEnding the gig with both new and\nold \u2013 the quietly spectacular End of\nthe World and the mosh-pit inducing\n\u201cBurn Baby Burn\u201d, respectively \u2013 Ash\ngave their fans everything they wanted,\nand by the looks on their faces, the reception they received was worth all the\nblood, sweat and tears that had gone\ninto their latest musical offering.\nDo yourself a favour: when Ash next\ncomes to visit your hometown, go and\nbathe yourself in the \u201cTwilight\u201d. They\nmay tell you that \u201cYou Can\u2019t Have It\nAll\u201d, but in some cases such as this, it is\nvery clear that with Ash, you can.\nRobin Andrews\nAsh looking all pretty somehow in incredibly clashing colours.

Here\u2019s a recipe for some good old red meat \u2013 Enjoy!\nNothing can beat a nice Sunday\nRoast, especially the traditional\nroast beef with Yorkshire puds.\nFor those non-UK students out\nthere, this is a must \u2013 British\ncooking at its very best!\nMost people think that a roast\ndinner is difficult to cook. Well,\nit\u2019s not actually that tough for\neven the most culinary challenged of you. This is a great way\nto impress your own parents with\nhow you are coping with the big\nwide world and will earn a ton of\nbrownie points, or even your girlfriend/girlfriend\u2019s parents.\nYou\u2019ll need: A roasting dish,\nsaucepans (minimum of 2) and a\njug.\nIngredients:\n1.25kg joint of beef (back rib, topside or silverside), 100g plain flour,\n1 egg beaten, 300ml milk, 200g potatoes per person, 400g parsnips,\ngravy granules, 400g carrots, pack\nof sugar snap peas, oil, salt and\npepper.\nMethod:\nPre-heat the oven to 220/Gas Mark\n7. Rinse the joint and pat dry. Season the joint and place in roasting\npan.\nRoast for one hour for rare meat\n(15 minutes plus 15 minutes per\n500g), or 1 hour 20 minutes for\nmedium meat (20 minutes plus 20\nminutes per 500g). For well-done\nmeat cook for 1 hour 40 minutes\n(25 minutes plus 25 minutes per\n500g). For the rest of the timings\nbelow, I have assumed medium\ncooking time of 1h 20 mins.\nWash and peel the potatoes,\nwhilst bringing a kettle of water to\nthe boil. Cut the potatoes into even-sized pieces and boil in a saucepan\nfor 5-10 minutes or until they lose\na little of their hardness. Drain and\nsprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook\nin the roasting pan with the meat\nfor 1-1.5 hours depending on how\ncrispy you like them. For the rest of\nthe timings below, I have assumed\nmedium cooking time.\nCut both ends of the parsnips and\npeel. Slice in half, and cut into batons of even size. Par-boil, as you\ndid with the potatoes (you can do\nthem together to save on washing\nup!). Roast with the potatoes for\nthe same amount of time.\nFor the Yorkshire puddings, sift\nthe flour and salt into a mixing\nbowl. Make a well in the centre of\nthe flour and pour in the egg and\nhalf the milk. Mix the liquid into\nthe flour until a smooth batter is\nformed. Use an electric whisk if\nnecessary. Gradually beat in the\nrest of the milk. Put a little oil in\neach of the holes in a twelve-hole\nbun tin.\nPut the tin into the oven for a few\nminutes to heat the oil. Fill the bun\ntin with the batter. Cook with the\nroast for 20 minutes, or until the\npuddings are golden. Alternatively\nuse Aunty Bessie\u2019s frozen puds,\nthey are amazing \u2013 just pop them\non a baking tray in the foil dishes\nfor about 12-15 minutes.\nTop and tail the carrots (i.e. chop\noff the top and bottom) and slice\nthinly. Boil in water in a saucepan\nfor 10-15 minutes or steam for 10-15 minutes depending on how soft\nyou like them. Steam or boil the\nsugar snap peas for 4-5 minutes.\nTime-plan to eat at 8.00pm:\n6:30 Peel and boil the potatoes and parsnips.\n6:40 Rinse and dry the meat.\nPut the meat, potatoes\nand parsnips in the\noven.\nNow you can relax for a bit and\nlay the table, wash up, pour wine\n(red wine is recommended, for\nexample, Shiraz).\n7:30 Begin making Yorkshire\npuddings and warm the\nbun tin.\n7:40 Put the Yorkshire puddings into the oven.\n7:45 Peel carrots and boil.\n7.55 Put sugar snap peas on\nto boil/steam.\n8:00 Serve.\nFancy some goat?\nDavid Stewart jerks off Caribbean style\nSo, the authentic creative gastropubs\n(whom I adore) are pushing up the\nprices of the bad normal pubs because\npeople now think fish and chips is\nworth twenty quid, and the still-cheap\nchain pubs are pretending to be gas-tropubs by giving you a big plate. Fine.\nI don\u2019t like it, but I get it. What\u2019s the\nimplicit tragedy? \u2013 That there are no\nnormal pubs selling normal food of\ngastropub quality at a reasonable price.\nWrong! There is the Queen\u2019s Arms in\nQueens Gate Mews, just a short walk\nfrom campus!\nIt\u2019s a simple point I have to make\nabout it: the food is completely standard pub fare on paper (including such\nmenu staples as bangers and mash,\nburgers, steak and chips), but is actually executed to a very high standard\u2026\nnormal pub food at gastropub qual-ity! That\u2019s pretty special if you ask me.\nOthers seem to agree judging from\nits popularity with a civilised crowd\nof students and Albert Hall goers, all\nspilling out onto the beautiful cobbled\nmews.\nWe fought over our starter of breaded calamari with sweet chilli and rocket (my mouth is watering right now\nwhilst thinking about it). The girl I\nwas with is greedy, so she had a steak.\nI stole some and it was richly bloody.\nI was drunk so craved the macaroni\ncheese- plus I was just ecstatic to see\nit on a menu; and my craving was more\nthan satisfied.\nSo hurrah for the London Pub! Bring\nback porridge and kippers for break-fast, kedgeree for lunch and toad-in-the-hole for supper, I say. Then the\nonly tragedy will be the lack of dart\nS\nuppose you are a homosexual gearing up for a night of\nmayhem on or around Old\nCompton Street. Suppose\nfurther (which is even more\nunlikely) that you are not a member\nof the white T-shirt brigade that survives on a diet of cocktails and the miniscule piece of nutrition provided by\na sugar-coated ecstasy tab. You may\ntherefore wish to eat more than half a\nwon-ton before precipitating yourself\nin the crazy world of gay. Perhaps, for\nexample, you are a \u2018bear\u2019. Then a cheap\nand decent, filling meal on Dean Street\ncourtesy of Mr Jerk might be just the\nthing for you.\nAbout six or seven years ago, by my\nrecollection, there was suddenly an\nepidemic of Caribbean takeaways; one\nappearing on every high street when\nthere were previously none. Most of\nthese are (or were) crap- the cheapest possible chunks of meat in insipid\nsauces served on a mound of stodgy\n\u2018rice&peas\u2019 is the staple offering. Mr\nJerk, (which now has two branches:\n\u2018Original Mr Jerk\u2019 and \u2018Jerk City\u2019) is the\nsingle source of good Caribbean food\nin the West End. Indeed, with the exception of the more upmarket operations like the Mango Room and Cottons in Camden, it\u2019s the only decent\nvenue in Zone 1.\nSaltfish and Ackee is a traditional\nCarribean offering - fish is preseved\nin salt then rehydrated and cooked\nwith an otherwise tasteless fruit, ac-kee - which comes in an intensely rich\nversion here with the saltfish dutifully\nsoaked and cooked until falling apart,\nas it should be. The goat curry is exceptionally flavoursome too and the\nsauce was pleasantly soaked up by the\n\u2018hard food\u2019 accompaniment. But the\nreal draw is of course the eponymous\njerk chicken which blackened to within\nan inch of charcoal, comes doused in a\nseriously hot and sour sauce which is\nas good a decongestant as friar\u2019s bal-sam. It sounds horrible but it\u2019s refreshing and unspeakably tasty. If you fancy\nsampling the fare while passing, grab\none of the saltfish dumplings for three\npounds or so, sitting in the hot shelf by\nthe window. They\u2019re sensational.\nA main meal is about \u00a37 plus drinks.\nOriginal Mr Jerk, 187 Wardour\nStreet, 02074377770 & Jerk City,\n189 Wardour Street 02072872878\nboards.\nA main meal is about \u00a39-15 plus\ndrinks.\nThe Queen\u2019s Arms, 30 Queens\nGate Mews, South Kensington,\n02075817741\nNoel Forrest\nSome Jerk Chicken mmmm\nThe lovely Queens Arms Pub: doesn\u2019t it look nice?\nBeefy goodness...

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 9 November 2007 felix\nNews\nThe recent controversial comments\nmade by American geneticist and\nDNA pioneer, Dr James Watson, have\nled to accusations of racism, the cancellation of his UK book tour, and most\nrecently, his resignation as Chancellor\nof Cold Springs Harbour Laboratory in\n\u201cYou what, son? You can\u2019t say that!\u201d\nDNA pioneer Dr James Watson\u2019s recent comments have caused a storm of controversy within the media\nthat has reverberated throughout the world. Felix headed to the Biology department in search of answers\nAndrew Turley New York.\nOn 25 October, the laboratory announced he would be retiring after nearly 40 years at the research\ninstitute.\nPreviously, the Science Museum\nin London cancelled a sold-out talk\nWatson was due to give, stating that\nhis comments had \u201cgone beyond the\npoint of acceptable debate\u201d. Watson\nwas forced to cancel the tour to promote his new book, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, and\nreturned to America.\nThe controversial comments leading up to these events were made in an\ninterview Watson gave for The Sunday\nTimes. In it he said he was \u201cinherently\ngloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d\nbecause \u201call our social policies are\nbased on the fact that their intelligence\nis the same as ours \u2013 whereas all the\ntesting says not really\u201d.\nHe said that he hopes everyone is\nequal, but that \u201cpeople who have to\ndeal with black employees find this not\ntrue\u201d.\nSpeaking to Felix, Professor Ian\nOwens, Head of the Division of Biology in Imperial\u2019s Faculty of Natural Sciences, said that comments of the kind\nmade by Watson were unsupported by\nscientific evidence.\nHe explained that the concept of\nrace is complex. Traditionally, scientists have viewed it as an artificial construct without a genetic basis, used as a\nconvenient label to crudely categorise\npopulations. More recent data has suggested that some genetic lineages can\nbe identified, and that these perhaps\nvary according to geography, but it remains unclear what relation, if any, this\nhas to skin colour.\nAccording to Professor Owens, intelligence is similarly problematic. Environmental factors are known to play\na significant role. Furthermore, there\nis no one type of intelligence, making\nobjective measuring difficult, if not\nimpossible. If genes determining intelligence can be identified, they are likely\nto be many, with complex relations,\nand as yet research is extremely lim-ited. Therefore, to link these two areas\nin this fashion is scientifically unjusti-fied. Watson has since apologised for\nhis comments.\nFor those interested in finding out\nmore about the area, Professor Owens\nrecommends Genes, Peoples, and Languages by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza as\nan excellent starting point.\nDr James Watson back in the day\nImperial climbs to 5th in the\nworld. UCL also leaps to 9th\nThis year\u2019s results for the Times Higher Education Supplement\u2019s (THES) annual university world league table were\nrevealed on Thursday.\nLast year Imperial was ranked 9th in\nthe world. It has climbed four places\nsince then and now sits at number\nfive. Imperial was beaten by Harvard\nwhich sits on top of the pile, followed\nby Cambridge, Oxford and Yale which\nall share second place. Depending on\nhow much of an Imperial fanboy you\nare, it could be argued that Imperial is\nin fact 3rd in the world.\nUniversity College London (UCL) is\nhot on Imperial\u2019s heels however, climbing all the way from 25th to this year\u2019s\n9th position.\nThe UK has four universities ranked\nwithin the Top 10 and the remaining\nplaces are made up of universities from\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nAmerica. Impressively, both Imperial\nand UCL are above the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology (MIT) whilst\nImperial even managed to pip Princeton university into 5th place.\nSome students have said that this reflects the absurdity of the THES University World Ranking, rather than the\nUK\u2019s academic excellence and that they\nare taking it all with a heavy pinch of\nsalt.\nThe World Ranking is based on\nsurveys of around 5,000 academics as\nwell as the views from 1,500 international companies. Data was also collected about staff-student ratios and\nthe number of international students\nat the universities.\nRumours that Imperial, UCL, Oxford\nand Cambridge are going to join together like the mighty Power Rangers\nto form Impucloxbridge University to\ndefeat the dastardly Harvard are complete and utter nonsense.\nGovernment privatises student loans debt\nThe government has announced it will\nsoon be allowed to sell student loan\ndebt to private companies. The \u201cSale\nof Student Loans Bill\u201d, first suggested\nin March of this year, was confirmed\non Tuesday in documents released to\ncoincide with the Queen\u2019s speech.\nThe bill will allow the government\nto sell off the \u00a318.1bn debt portfolio\nin order to make a profit, estimated at\naround \u00a36bn, whilst it claims that full\ncontrol of interest rates, terms and repayment conditions will remain with\nministers. This means that individual\nstudents should see no change to their\nloans, though their debt is owned by\nexternal organisations.\nConcern over this move has been\nvoiced from several sources. It is\nfeared by some that this is part of a\nlonger-term strategy to bring the Student Loans system up to more market-standard levels, and reduce the level\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\nof subsidy that the treasury currently\npays. Several prominent education fig-ures, such as our own Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, have called for an increase\nin loan interest rates, and support for a\nhigher education funding model more\nin line with the US system.\nThere is also worry over the security\nof debt portfolios sold in this fashion,\nafter the US \u201ccredit crunch\u201d of recent\nweeks was triggered by the sale of\n\u201crisky\u201d debt in the mortgage market.\nThe NUS (National Union of Students) President Gemma Tumelty has\nstated that the students\u2019 union \u201chope\nthat the confusion experienced by\ngraduates last time the government\nsold student loans is avoided.\u201d Meanwhile, future students question the\nconstantly increasing debt that they\nare being encouraged into by government and big business.\nAre students going to be shafted by increased loan interest rates?\nWhenever a scientist or prominent academic makes any comment\non a sensitive subject there is always a flurry of discussion and com-ment. In media circles, the perceived weight of a scientist\u2019s view\nimmediately opens up their statement to intense scrutiny. Harvard\npresident Lawrence Summers, and his infamous 2005 speech on the\ndifferences between male and female abilities, is a classic example of\nill-advised personal opinion, and the negative impact that it can have\non a well-respected institute.\nWhatever Dr Watson said (he has since suggested that he was mis-quoted), the casual manner in which he addressed a subject which\nremains controversial, even on a scientific level, should show any\nacademic the importance of choosing their words carefully. The subject of race is especially difficult, even genetically speaking: a fact\nwhich should have been apparent to a biological scientist of such\nreputation.\nThe divide between professional and personal opinion is an impossible problem. When does a scientific hypothesis become influenced\nby personal views? Should ideas be kept private, or exposed so that\npeople can put your work into context? The difficulties encountered\nby a scientist entering into any kind of political, or unscientific,\ndebate renders many subjects taboo.\nHistorically, the personal opinions of scientists are responsible for some horrific events, the most obvious of which is\nthe Holocaust; Nazi scientists, who set out to prove there\nwas a scientific basis for Aryan philosophies, carried\nout some of the worst atrocities, and contributed to\nthe \u201cvalidity\u201d of the Reich.\nScience remains a powerful political tool, and the\nblurring of lines between science and opinion\ncan lead to unforeseen and far-reaching\nconsequences.\nWhether fair or not, scientists must\nalways be aware that any opinion\nor statement that is aired will\nbe used to put their work in\ncontext, and will influence\ntheir reception in many\nimportant ways.\nAndrew Somerville\nThe Scientist, or the Science?\nControversy and prejudice in academia\n\n"

All very professional, but as with any proper home-built rig they\u2019ve come up with some \u201dinnovative\u201d solutions for nonessential bits. Like bulldog clips to hold the curtains up\nCool science: superbad superfluids\nNext time you walk into your building at Imperial, keep your eyes open\nfor the signs leading to the research\nlabs. Mech Eng has the provocatively\nnamed \u201cVibration Technology Centre\u201d\nand \u201cLubrication Laboratory,\u201d and you\nknow something good is going on at the\n\u201cCreep and Fatigue Laboratory.\u201d But\nyou can easily finish your career as a\nstudent without ever going through the\ndoors of any these places, which means\nyou\u2019re missing out on the coolest stuff\non campus. If you could go through the\nkeyhole you\u2019ll find the biggest, most\ncutting-edge machines, hidden away\nwithin the labs of Imperial.\nThe coolest machine at Imperial has\ngot to be found where temperatures\nhover around 675 nanoKelvin (just\nabove absolute zero) at the Centre\nfor Cold Matter in the Department of\nPhysics. Research Associate Jos Dingjam and a team of three PhDs handle\nthis machine, which goes by the mysterious name of \u201cThe Science Chamber\u201d.\nThe Science Chamber is part of a\nmuch bigger rig, but it gets its name\nsince \u201cthat\u2019s where the science happens,\u201d says Dingjam. It\u2019s a vacuum\nchamber where they create a cloud of\nsuper-cooled rubidium atoms, known\nas a Bose-Einstein condensate.\nThe atoms are intensely cooled by\nlasers until they are all at their lowest\npossible quantum energy state, where\nthings start to get very weird. In this\nstate they can\u2019t be distinguished from\neach other in any way\u2014they exist in\nthe same location and with the same attributes\u2014so they form a kind of super-atomic blob that behaves in ways that\nwe in the normal temperature range\ncan\u2019t imagine. For example, since the\nOur plucky reporter delves deep into the Centre for Cold Matter to investigate the \u201cScience Chamber\u201d\natoms in the blob all move in exactly\nthe same way, the blob has no interior\nfriction, which leads to cool superfluid\nbehaviour like flowing uphill.\nInside the chamber, the cloud of\natoms is wrangled into shape by the\nmagnetic field formed by an atom chip;\na square piece of gold-plated silicon,\nwith tiny wires carved into its gleaming gold surface. This gives the team\nenough control over the cloud to split\nit in two and study how the wave patterns interfere with one another.\nLike many of the coolest machines\nat Imperial, the Science Chamber is a\nhome-built rig, and it shows. It\u2019s set in\na room-filling metal rack, enclosed by\nblack curtains held up with big bulldog\nclips. The top of the rack is filled with\nvarious power supplies and heat sinks\nthat handle the vast wattage needed to\nkeep the lasers burning and the currents flowing.\nRadiating around the chamber is a\nweb of tiny mirrors, prisms and lenses\nthat get the lasers into the shape, place,\nand state where they are needed. The\nlasers are set up so that the beams are\nnot dangerous for day-to-day work,\nbut the team nevertheless wears protective eyewear when reconfiguring\nthe beams to avoid the risk of boiling\nretinas.\nAll this power is necessary to create an environment within the Science\nChamber so extreme that it can support a Bose-Einstein condensate, the\nso-called fifth state of matter. In a place\nlike this, the motto is \u201cForget the electricity bill, full speed ahead.\u201d\nFlora Graham\n\u201cMech Eng has\nthe provocatively\nnamed \u2018Vibration\nTechnology\nCentre\u2019 and\n\u2018Lubrication\nLaboratory\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cThe team\nwears protective\neyewear to avoid\nboiling their\nretinas\u201d\nAll that glisters... Well, in this case it\u2019s better than normal; at least this\nsilicon chip (used to split the cloud of cold atoms) is covered in gold\n\n"

Navratri is a celebration in\nhonour of the goddess, the mother of\nthe world, which begins on the first day\nof Ashvin and goes on for nine days,\nsymbolising the triumph of good over\nevil. During the nine days, feasting and\nfasting take precedence over all normal daily activities amongst Hindus.\nThe nine days are divided and devoted\nto the Trinity of God worshipped in a\nfemale form: Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati are worshipped as three different manifestations of Shakti, or cosmic\nenergy.\nNavratri is a festival of worship,\ndance and music. The most characteristic dances are the Dandiya Raas\nand the Garba dances, the origins of\nwhich can be traced back to the leg-Hindu Society recently celebrated the festival of Navratri in the Great Hall. Sally Longstaff donned her\nsaree and went along to find out more about modern Hindus and their spectacular ancient ceremonies\nends about the life of Lord Krishna.\nPainted earthen pots with water and a\nlamp inside symbolise the power of the\ngoddess and are traditionally put in the\nhome at this time. The word \u201cGarba\u201d\nmeans \u201cwomb\u201d, and the lamp in the pot\nsymbolically represents life within the\nwomb. The period is considered a festive season, but also a time of renewal,\nofreawakening.Shrinesarecleanedout\nand new ventures are started. There is\nalso a focus on education and learning\nboth for Hindus and spreading awareness to others about Hinduism.\nI was invited to Ujaali on behalf\nof Felix by the Hindu Soc President,\nAjay Gandhi. I was a little apprehensive because I didn\u2019t really know what\nto expect. However I decided, having\nviewed the photos of last years spectacular on Hindu Soc\u2019s website, that\nI would have to get a saree. I found a\nbeautiful red and blue one with fabulous stitching and sequins. At the Navratri celebrations women wear traditional dresses such as sarees and choli\nwith lovely jewellery in amazingly diverse and bright colours.\nAfter being met by Ajay, the night\nbegan with Garba, which is a dance\nthat originated in the Gujarat region,\nstarted by the women and joined in by\nthe rest of the men. Garba is a circular\ndance, which was performed around\na statue of ShreeKrishna, clapping or\ndancing around and around with the\nsarees flowing around the room, like\nbeautiful butterflies. All the women\nlooked fantastic, and I have never seen\nsuch a whirl of colour and exotic fab-rics! After this, we were welcomed by\nAjay, who gave a short speech thanking the organisers and helpers and introducing the events of the evening. A\nfilm was then showed which described\nthe origins of Navratri followed by a\ndance performance of a specially choreographed piece. Afterwards everyone returned to the dancefloor for\nmore dancing of the Garba.\nThe most spiritual part of the evening\nwas during the prayer or Aarti. A traditional Hindu devotional song was\nsung during the ritual and light from\nwicks soaked in ghee or camphor was\noffered to the deity. Aarti is performed\nand sung to develop the highest love\nfor God: \u201cAa\u201d means \u201ctowards\u201d and\n\u201cA festive season\nbut also a time\nof renewal and\nreawakening\u201d\n\u201cIt was a very\nspritual and\nspecial part of\nthe evening\u201d\nTop: Meeting up with friends in the Great Hall; Above: Sally Longstaff, the Dance Performance, the girls and boys; Below: The Aarti Prayer around ShreeKrishna\n\n"
