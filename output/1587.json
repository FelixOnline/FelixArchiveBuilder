    "content": "22 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n07.11.2014\nWelfare\nfelix.welfare@imperial.ac.uk Welfare Editors Diba Esbati & Chanon Wongsatayanont\nWhen colours fade away\nChanon Wongs atayanont discusses the effects of depression\n\"What\nmakes\nlow mood\ndifferent\nfrom\ndepression\nis its\nduration,\nintensity\nand\npersistence.\"\n\"It's like\nyou've\ntaken a\nstep back\nfrom\nlife and\nbecome a\nspectator.\"\nThis week, let\u2019s move on from\nanxiety to the more cheerful\ntopic of depression. To the\nsufferers, it is the worst feeling in\nthe world. But for those who have\nnever experienced it, it is hard to\ntruly understand how unpleasant or\ndisruptive it is, so this article will try\nto explain how it feels.\nFirst things first, I have to clarify\nthat being depressed is not just being\nsad.\nWe use the phrase \u201cI feel depressed\u201d\nwhenever we feel that things aren\u2019t\ngoing our way but that is not\ndepression, clinically so. Ask your\nmedic friends who\u2019s done a psych\nmodule and they\u2019ll tell you that\ndepression is a mood disorder that\ndisrupts one\u2019s daily life and can be\npotentially life-threatening.\nHowever, because being sad is\nsimilar to being depressed, there\u2019s\na lot of misunderstanding that\ndownplays the struggle faced\nby people with depression. This\nsentiment can be summed up with\nthe statement: \u201cI\u2019ve felt down before\nbut I can snap out of it, so why can\u2019t\nthey just toughen up?\u201d\nWhat makes low mood different\nfrom depression is its duration,\nintensity and persistence.\nBeing depressed isn\u2019t just feeling\nsad or experiencing low self-esteem;\nit is often accompanied by a sense\nof hopelessness and the lack of\nmotivation to do anything, even\ngetting out of bed. You can probably\nsee how that can interfere with daily\nlife.\nThis sense of despair deserves\na special mention since it can be\ndifficult to fully grasp. This can\nrange from losing interest and\npleasure in what you used to enjoy,\nto an intensely blank state where\neverything in the world can be\nsummed up by the phrase, \u2018Why do\nI even bother?\u2019 It\u2019s like you\u2019ve taken\na step back from life and become a\nspectator, watching everything going\non but feeling absolutely empty.\nWorse, rather than a spectator, you\ncan also become your own malicious\ncritic, sneering at and condescending\nto everything you do. This is when\nself-blame and self-hate comes in,\nwhich can plunge you even deeper\ninto depression and potentially put\nyou in danger. I\u2019ll elaborate more on\nthis later.\nAs for duration, depression is\nchronic. Sufferers can be stuck in that\nmood for a few weeks or months. Or\nalternatively, it can last for a few days\nat a time, but will come back time\nand time again until you can almost\npredict when your next episode is\ngoing to be.\nDepression is also irrational, even\nif what they\u2019re depressed about\ncan seem perfectly rational to the\nsufferer. In other words, a phase\nmight come out of nowhere, not\nalways in response to a specific\nproblem. This is what makes it so\nhard for others to understand why\ndepressed people can\u2019t just \u201cpull\nthemselves together\u201d.\nWhen you\u2019re suffering from a low\nmood, you tend to feel better by\nmaking changes to your life, such\nas resolving a difficult situation\nor getting more sleep. It\u2019s not that\nsimple for depressed people because\nthe sufferer often doesn\u2019t feel any\nbetter no matter what they do, or they\nmight not even find the motivation\nto do anything. Most of the time, it\nsimply takes time and support for the\nsufferer to feel better.\nThis is why the sufferer often feels\nhelpless and isolated since there is\nnothing they can do to change how\nthey feel even if they\u2019re desperately\ntrying to \u2018get better\u2019.\nI\u2019ve once heard this description\nfrom a sufferer. He said that it\u2019s\nlike he is drowning in a stormy sea.\nHe tries to swim to the surface and\nbecome happy again, but the waves\nalways wash over his head, pushing\nhim back down into dark waters.\nEventually, he just gives in and waits\nfor the sea to calm.\nI touched earlier on self-blame,\nand this is where it comes in. Since\nthe sufferer is helpless to make\nthemselves feel better, they often\nturn to themselves and say \u201cWhy\naren\u2019t you living your life like\neverybody else? You don\u2019t even have\na reason to be sad!\u201d Sometimes, they\nare aware that they\u2019re suffering an\nepisode but there\u2019s nothing they can\ndo.\nSelf-blame can turn into self-hate which can spiral down a dark\nroad very quickly, especially in\nmore severe cases of depression.\nFortunately, self-harm and suicidal\nthoughts are not common with\ndepression, and those are the\nmoments professional help may be\nneeded.\nBut like most illnesses, recovery\nis always possible with the right\ntreatment and support. Patient,\nunderstanding friends who are\nwilling to bear with the sufferer\nthrough the episodes is as helpful as\nany professional help.\nDepressed people tend to avoid\nfriends and relatives. Even when\napproached, they can be irritable,\ngloomy and difficult. But you can\nshow that you care by listening,\nappreciating them or just spending\ntime with them. By doing so, even\nthough they don\u2019t show it at the time,\nyou are already helping immensely\nand they would say so once the\nepisode is over.\nAs for actively helping them, you\nmust be prepared to accept that\nsometimes, you can\u2019t in the same way\nyou\u2019d approach your own problems.\nInstead, it might be best to encourage\nthem to talk about their feelings\nand get them to work out what they\nthink is most likely to make them\nfeel better.\nIf, though, you feel that you are\nat a loss of what to do or you feel\nthat your friend is at risk of hurt\nthemselves, the numbers provided\nin the column beside are there to\nhelp you as well as the sufferers.\nAnd I hope this article helps you\nunderstand this crippling disorder a\nbit better.\nIf you are concerned\nabout your own\nmental health,or that\nof a loved one,there\nare people out there\nyou can talk to who\ncan give you advice,or\nwill be there to listen.\nSamaritans (24 hr\nhelpline)\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nWebsite: www.\nsamaritans.org.uk\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 9:30-17:30)\nWebsite: www.\nanxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10am-10pm)\nWebsite: www.\nnopanic.org.uk\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,1.30pm-4:30pm)\nAlcoholics\nAnonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nWebsite: www.\nalcoholics-anonymous.org.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nWebsite: www.ukna.\norg\nStudent Counselling\nService\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@\nic.ac.uk\nImperial College\nHealth Centre\nTelephone: 020 7584\n6301\ne-mail:healthcentre@\nic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal\ntutor regarding pastoral\nissues,especially if you\nthink your mental health\nmight be affecting your\nacademic performance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nYou might know that different things are hapening to you, but they don't feel very different. \u2013 Hyperbole and a Half Picture: Allie Brosh\n\n"

    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n07.11.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe votes have been cast,\nthe results are in, and\nthe outcome is far from\nunexpected. The Democrats have\nbeen unceremoniously kicked out of\nCapitol Hill.\nFor Obama, Clinton, and their\nsupporters, the impending cession of\ncontrol of both the House and Senate\nto the Republican Party has been\nakin to witnessing a train crash in\nslow motion: they could do nothing\nbut stand helplessly as the caucus\nslowly and inexorably steamed\ntowards its calamitous eventuality. It\nwas never a question of: \u201cAre we going\nto win the midterms?\u201d but rather\n\u201chow badly will we lose them?\u2019\u201d\nFortunately for the Democrats,\nlosing Congress is not nearly as bad as\nit would seem.\nTo begin with, losing seats in\nCongress this late in one\u2019s Presidency\nis practically a given. Since 1934,\nvirtually every two-term president\nhas lost seats in both the Senate\nand the House (with Clinton in\n1998 being the sole exception).\nCombine this with a significant\nnumber of already present red seats;\nbrimming Republican campaign\ncoffers; and an uphill battle against\ncontinuous Congressional gridlock,\nthe Democrats loss of the Senate\nand House was all but a political\ncertainty. The odds, as they say, were\nnever in their favour.\nNow the ball is squarely in the\ncourt of the GOP. They are in control\nof policy making in DC and the\nbrazen obstructionism that has been\nthe clarion call of their previous\nyears will help them no more. They\nwill have to suggest alternatives,\nput through legislation, and make\ngood on their various threats of\nimpeachment and prosecution.\nIn post-shutdown America, such\ngrandstanding is likely to alienate\npotential 2016 voters, while failure\nto do so would incur the wrath of\nthe Tea Party, who will not be truly\nsatisfied until Obama\u2019s head is firmly\nmounted on a stake on the steps of\nthe Capitol.\nThe way road to 2016 for Boehner,\nMcConnell, and the remainder of the\nRepublican Party is therefore not so\nmuch an easy stroll as it is a tightrope\nwalk. They must balance the wishes\nof the Tea Party and hard-line\nconservatives with harsh political\nrealities and an ever-sceptical pool\nof independent voters. Attempts will\nbe made to repeal the Affordable\nCare act, to deport undocumented\nimmigrants, and to push forward\nwith Keystone XL with the full\nknowledge that every single measure\nis likely to fail. If they do not die on\nCapitol Hill, then they will die on\nthe desk of the president. The result\nwill be a continuation of the same\nA fight or a careful balancing act? Photo: CNN\nNATHANIEL GALLOP\nCOMMENT WRITER\ntiresome political paralysis that has\nplagued the Capitol Hill from the\noutset of the Obama administration,\nonly now with a new party to direct\ntheir frustrations at in two years\u2019\ntime.\nIn the end, all that is left for the\nDemocrats in the House and Senate\nto do is to sit back, relax, and gather\npolitical ammunition for 2016. The\nRepublican Party, whether they are\nready or not, will have to tread their\nnew political tightrope very carefully.\nIt is, after all, a very long way\ndown.\nThe Midterms: Why every red cloud has a blue\nlining\nRecall the scene from the\nWizard of Oz where the\nWicked Witch of the West\nhinders the progress of Dorothy\nand company by sending them to\nsleep in a field of poppies. Does this\nnot encapsulate a basic \u2013 symbolic\n\u2013 truth about these flowers? Pace\nJohn McCrae of In Flanders Fields\nfame, the soporific effect of the plant\nhas been attested to since antiquity\nand has so associated itself with\nthe drug that it wormed its way\ninto the Latinate nomenclature:\nPapaver Somniferum. In fact, the\nremembrance poppies are of a\ndifferent species to their brethren \u2013\nsource of the opiates \u2013 but forgive me\nif I dismiss this as pedantry (outside\nthe field of botany where it is no\ndoubt important).\nFor the poppy is today as anodyne\nas the charities it represents. Who\nseriously dismisses the heroism of\nthe soldiers butchered in the great\nEuropean slaughter of a century\nago? Who can deny the living ex-servicemen and women their right\nto support? Who, in a word, would\nrefuse to buy a poppy?\nAnd yet. When I say charity\nis anodyne, I mean just that: an\nanalgesic applied to the wounds and\nsores of the civic body allowing the\nstate behemoth to lumber onwards.\nArguments about the evacuation of\n(moral) responsibility which charity\nallows the state, or the general\ndeficiencies of social palliatives are\ncommon enough and do not need\nreiterating here; I simply mention\nthem to indicate my broad sympathy\nwith these positions. Nor do I want\nto dwell too long on Alan Bennett\u2019s\npithy remark about the cenotaphs\nand the respectful silences, those\ngreat mute obelisks of reified grief:\ntheir true message is not lest we\nforget, but lest we remember. A\nminute of respect is easy enough, and\nin return we are relieved for a year\nof \u2013 in the words of Karl Marx \u2013 \u201cthe\ntraditions of past generations [which]\nweigh like a nightmare on the minds\nof the living.\u201d Is it not ironic that\nthe poppy serves as the symbol for\nthis collective dulling of our critical\nconsciousness?\nPoppies, however, have a more\nchequered past. Heroin, of course, is\nstill derived from its seeds, but surely\nthe greatest destruction wreaked by\nthe plant. This honour goes to the\ndevastating effects of the Opium\nWars. The First Opium War saw the\nmost vulgar expression of British\ngunboat diplomacy, \u2018freely\u2019 allowing\nthe Chinese people to consume this\ndeadly drug.\nIncidentally, the Opium War was\ncertainly a necessary condition of\nthe devastating Taiping Rebellion in\nwhich some 20 million people died.\nThe destruction caused by the drug\nitself is incalculable. But fortunately\nA sysmbol of rememberance, or a reminder of a chequered past? Photo: Daily Mail\nthe effects were not wholly negative:\nIndia\u2019s trade surpluses were siphoned\noff by the British through \u2018Home\nCharges\u2019. These surpluses came from\nfirst from cotton and second from the\nopium \u2013 a state monopoly \u2013 which\nended up in China.\nHow can we reconcile this deadly\nlegacy \u2013 and deadly it was \u2013 with\nthe poppies\u2019 pacific legacy? I would\nsimply suggest we can\u2019t. WWI was\nPoppies will put them to sleep\nthe first great modern conflagration,\nand as such it was a great leveller:\nthe slaughter was, for the first time,\nlargely classless.\nWe recognise the genuine trauma\nthat this war caused on our historical\nconsciousness; how could we not? But\nthe poppy is an ambivalent symbol;\nthe hecatombs of the poor of the\ncolonised \u2018East\u2019 are left faint behind\nthe iridescence of the poppy\u2019s petals.\nChristy Kelly examines whether poppies are an appropriate symbol of remembrance\n\"To begin with,\nlosing seats in\nCongress this\nlate in one's\nPresidency is\npractically a\ngiven.\"\n\n"

These were:\n- A photo in Sport was attributed to\nIC Cross Country, but was provided\nby IC Rugby\n- Last issue, we reported that CCTV\nfootage from Heston was released\nto the Union. Although the incident\nis being investigated, the footage\nitself has not been released directly\nto the Union.\n- Some of puzzles were unsolvable.\nSo don\u2019t feel bad if you couldn\u2019t\ncomplete them all.\n-Missing off the newest member of\nthe Copy Edting team from the list\n\u2013 sorry Abby.\nThis week, another rugby team\nhas been suspending following\nanother stint of bad behaviour.\nAlthough this lessened the logistics of\narranging our front page (literally, we\ncould have just changed the name of\nthe team from last week\u2019s issue), it is\nbecoming a much more difficult topic\nfor us, as a student paper, to report on.\nWe are aware that these stories\nhave the potential to go national\nand therefore bring disrepute onto\nImperial College and Imperial College\nUnion as a result. We are also aware\nthat it could have an impact on\nthose involved, who, although have\nremained nameless, may be affiliated\nwith the club.\nAs an independent paper, we can\u2019t\nrefuse to cover stories that are of\nthe public interest. We also can\u2019t\nbe told what stories we shouldn\u2019t\ncover either by the Union or the\nCollege. We are lucky that both\nhave been understanding of this and\nco-operative, a privilege many other\nstudent papers don\u2019t enjoy.\nStudent Unions at other\ninstitutions have a habit of meddling\nwith student newspapers, and can\nreduce them down to an extension\nof their publicity material if they\nare too careless. The papers cease\nto function as intended, and harm\nthe development of the journalistic\nskillset of the students involved with\nthe publications and also the quality\nof the paper as a whole.\nIt also makes the whole thing a lot\nless fun and a lot more laborious for\nus.\nWe are always keen to put across\nthe student\u2019s side of the story, as we\nare students too. Although it may be\neasier and simpler to let the Union\nrelease a statement on your behalf,\nif you find yourself under scrutiny\nfrom a student media outlet, do try to\nput forward your take on the events\ntoo. It might be the only chance you\nget, as the national media may not be\nas kind.\nA prime example of this is the story\nwe\u2019ve also covered this week of The\nSun looking to pay student papers for\nincriminating photos of Halloween\ncostumes this year.\nAgain, students \u201cmisbehaving\u201d\ngenerate interest, clicks, and money.\nWe have sadder news this week,\nabout the passing of a student this\nweek. We offer our condolences to the\nfamily and friends of Tian Wei Chew.\nWe also have some great student\nnews in this week\u2019s issue too. Our\niGEM team came second in their\nglobal synthetic biology competition,\nwhich is outstanding.\nTherefore it\u2019s a mixed bag of an\nissue this week.

Millions more\njust wanted\nto watch\nthe chaos.\"\nThe team that conquered all...you will never be forgotten! ALL HAIL LORD HELIX Photo: Joystiq\nRemember that thing that\neveryone cared about for one\nweek in February? To a future\nhistorian it\u2019ll look like a weird mind\nvirus infected everyone for exactly a\nweek and then disappeared. Let\u2019s talk\nabout it again!\nIf you missed it, in February a\nprogrammer created a channel\non Twitch (a game streaming site)\ncalled Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon to play\nPok\u00e9mon Red, the first Pok\u00e9mon game.\nThe twist? It wasn\u2019t the streamer\nplaying the game, it was Twitch.\nThere\u2019s a chatbox by the stream\nwhere people can discuss it live. The\nstreamer (identity still unknown)\nhad the simple idea of writing code\nto make the game follow the chat\u2019s\ncommands. Along with regular\nchatting, stream viewers could type\n\u201cup, down, left, right\u201d to move the\ncharacter in the cardinal directions\nand \u201ca, b, start\u201d to interact with\nthings.\nThe result was a stream where (at\nits peak) hundreds of thousands of\npeople were playing one single-player\ngame. The protagonist, Red, turned\ninto a schizophrenic lunatic. He\nwalked in totally random directions.\nHe\u2019d check the menu every 20\nseconds. He\u2019d discard useful items.\nHe\u2019d make terrible decisions. It was\nhilarious.\nFor about a week, it went viral.\nEveryone was talking about it \u2013 it\neven made BBC news! People called\nit a \u2018social experiment\u2019 \u2013 could this\nmany people cooperate in such an\nabsurd, ad-hoc way? Thousands of\npeople wanted to say where Red\nshould go. Millions more just wanted\nto watch the chaos.\nWhen a new game comes out, it\u2019s\na talking point for everyone who\nplays it. When this began, everyone\nwas talking about the same game.\nWe all grew attached to aaabaaajss\nthe Pidgeot and ABBBBBBK the\nCharmeleon. (The game lets you\nnickname your Pok\u00e9mon. The cursor\nstarts on A. You get the idea.) They\nwere our Pok\u00e9mon. We were all\nwatching the same character get stuck\nin the same place.\nAnd of course there were the\nmemes, most prominently the fossil.\nAt one point the only item Red had\nwas the Helix Fossil, a semi-useless\nitem you can\u2019t discard. Incessant\nspamming meant that Red would\ncheck his bag once a minute and try\nto use the fossil, leading many to joke\nthat he was \u2018consulting\u2019 it. The fossil\ntook on mythic status overnight.\nWithin days it had formed a pseudo-religion. The chat was filled with\ndemands that we consult our lord and\nsaviour the Helix as much as possible.\nWhen the players miraculously used\nthe fossil for its intended purpose,\n\u2018reviving\u2019 it into the Pok\u00e9mon\nOmanyte, it immediately became a\ndeity, Lord Helix.\nAnd then, amazingly, they won.\nAfter 16 days of stumbling around\ncaves/buildings and releasing\n(effectively killing) most of their\ncritters, they beat the main game\nstory. The stream shut down for\na while and then restarted with\nminigames, but promising to return\nsoon with Pok\u00e9mon Crystal, the sequel\nto Red.\nAnd then people left. Clearly a lot\nof viewers were just there for the\nnovelty \u2013 just to see if it could be\ndone. Once vindicated, they saw no\nreason to go on. Others were there\nto troll and derail the playthrough\n(was winning really the \u2018point\u2019 of the\nstream, though?), and got bored. You\nwere probably one of these people.\nBut I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m still watching. That\u2019s\nright \u2013 it\u2019s still going.\nThe Crystal playthrough happened,\nbeating a much longer game in a\nslightly shorter time thanks to the\nreduced trolling. Then a brief break,\nthen the next game in the series,\nEmerald. Then Fire Red, then Platinum,\nHeart Gold, Black, Black 2, and finally a\ngame only a year old, Pok\u00e9mon X.\nWith every game viewership\ndwindled. By Platinum they were\naveraging under 1,000 viewers at a\ntime (so still tens of thousands a day\n\u2013 the stream runs 24/7). The memes\ndried up.\nDespite constant new events and\nstories, with fewer people watching\nthere simply weren\u2019t as many people\nmaking memes. It got to the point\nwhere chat was slow enough for \u2018chat\nleaders\u2019 to emerge \u2013 people who knew\nwhat to instruct the rest of the players\nto do to progress more quickly, whose\nmessages could be read amidst the\ncacophony. The only people left were\npeople playing to \u2018win\u2019, and so by\nPok\u00e9mon X the game was finished in\nsix days.\nBy then a great community had\nemerged. People communicated over\nSkype, posted plans on the Subreddit,\nand even talked about their work day\nin chat. The people who stuck with the\nstream had become friends, united\nby their desire to collectively move a\nsingle game character from point A to\na really far away point B.\nTwitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon is like\nthe Pok\u00e9mon phenomenon on a\nshorter timescale. Both started off\nmassive, with global media attention\nand cultural awareness, and both\ngradually fell in influence, leaving\nbehind a core of dedicated fans\nwho want to do it again and again.\nClearly part of the appeal of TPP\nwas nostalgia \u2013 people remembered\nplaying Red as a kid.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 11\n07.11.2014\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOne of the most common\ncomplaints in politics is that\nall political parties seem the\nsame. Douglas Carswell has profited\nfrom the rise of UKIP by switching\nalliances from the Conservatives,\nclaiming that the far-right political\nparty supports \u201cfundamental change\u201d\nin British politics. However, the fact\nis that extreme political parties have\nnot fared too well in Britain.\nSurely, if UKIP and other parties\nof the far-Right could really succeed\nin the UK, then similar parties\nwould have made also made it into\ngovernment. Nonetheless, since\n1945 there have been only two\nparties in Downing Street, with only\nConservative and Labour (apart\nfrom other parties within coalitions)\nholding the majority. Both of these\nparties are moderate, with the\nConservatives on the Right and\nLabour on the Left. One possible way\nof answering this question is through\nthe tool of political economic theory\nand modelling.\nIn order to model in economics,\nit is often necessary to make\nassumptions. For example, an\neconomist might assume that all\nindividuals have perfect knowledge\nof the market. Assumptions\nhelp economists to model real-world systems by simplifying a\nproblem until it can be analysed\nmathematically.\nA useful model was invented by\nDuncan Black of the University\nof Glasgow in 1948, known as\nthe Median Voter Theorem. This\ntheorem states that the elected party\nwill have a political view most similar\nto the view of the median voter; that\nis, the median individual in terms of\npolitical views in the electorate.\nThe first assumption in the model\nis that all the parties running in\nthe election can be placed along a\nsingle spectrum from extreme Left\nto extreme Right. This assumption\nis not always true, as parties have\nvarious policies that overlap in terms\nof political alignment. In the case of\nthe Liberal Democrats, no one really\nhas any idea at all.\nAnother assumption is single-peaked political preferences. This\nmeans that a voter will choose the\npolitical party that is closest to their\nview on the political spectrum. This\nassumption is also prone to issues;\nwe have seen the far-Right UKIP\ntaking away votes from Labour and\nConservative voters in the 2014\nEuropean elections.\nSometimes, one particular policy\nwill cause voters to move from the\ncentre to the wings. Voters also tend\nto get disillusioned with one party\nand want change; voters can be fickle\nand swing their votes.\nThe median voter theorem has\nimportant implications: when voter\nturnout increased in lower-income\nclasses in 1960s USA, the Democrat\nparty-who are supportive of wealth\nredistribution-performed more\nDo all views fall in the middle of the political spectrum? Photo: IBTimes\nstrongly in elections. Perhaps a \u201cYes\u201d\nvote in the Scottish Referendum\nwould have changed the position of\nthe hypothetical \u201cMedian Voter\u201d,\ntaking Labour votes and increasing\nthe power of UKIP, despite their\nrelatively extreme standpoint.\nWill the Labour-Conservative duopoly break?\nSamuel Bodansky discusses the theory behing political economic modelling\nCurrently the results of the 2015\nGeneral Election are uncertain;\nit could be the first time that the\ntraditional Labour-Conservative\nduopoly is broken. Whatever the\nresult, economic models remain a\nuseful predictor of voting behaviour.\nIrecently took a stroll down the\nonline memory lane that is the\nFelix archive, all the way back to\nthe heady days of 1998. Times have\nchanged.\nBack then it was acceptable to\nwrite in to Felix to announce that the\nUnion President was \u201cutterly, utterly,\nutterly fucked\u201d at the Summer Ball. It\nwas also fine and dandy for \u2018Colonel\nWicky, Sergeant M\u2019Arse and Petty\nOfficer Jism\u2019 to recount their attempt\nto break into the Queen\u2019s Tower at\n3am one morning.\nEven the news stories were bizarre:\nLike the time when rowing club\u2019s\nminibus ended up in the Thames;\na pitched fistfight-battle after an\nArabian society function over the\npossession of a mobile phone; the\nfootball club ripping the plumbing\nout of a pub in Hammersmith\n(getting all Imperial Students barred\nin the process); and the time in the\nold Southside bar when the Rugby\nCaptain punched another player in\nthe face so hard that he needed five\nstitches.\nThese are just a few examples taken\nat random from a small selection\nof issues from the 1997-8 academic\nyear. The pages of Felix were chock\nfull of Union Bar nose-breakings,\npunch-ups, and all manner of laddish\nbehavior, but no one seemed to care\nall that much.\nFast forward sixteen years and\nwe see the anti-social behaviour of\nImperial students splashed across not\nonly these hallowed pages, but also\nthe Evening Standard, The Independent,\nThe Telegraph, and the Huffington Post.\nIncidents that were commonplace\nin days gone past are now occasional\nscandals that threaten the reputation\nof our University and our Students\u2019\nUnion.\nAny reasonable person can see that\nthese incidents, past and present, are\nnot acceptable. Today, firm sanctions\nare applied to those who engage in\nthese often-criminal actions, as is\nright and proper. But why didn\u2019t the\nsame happen to our predecessors?\nThere are a number of possible\nexplanations, but one of the most\nappealing is the inexorable rise of\nsocial media and 24-hour online news\ncoverage. Before Facebook, Twitter\nand Snapchat came along it was easy\nfor uncomfortable and embarrassing\nevents to stay out of the harsh glare\nthat is the media spotlight. These\nstories spread by word of mouth\nand through the printed page of\nFelix, which would likely have kept\nthem broadly within the student\ncommunity. Without any external\npressure, the path of least resistance\nis to forget about these events,\nand not to take action against the\nperpetrators.\nNowadays, many of the people and\nClubs who do stupid things like this\nwill even broadcast their activities\non social media, sending snaps,\ntweets and statuses of things that\nthey really shouldn\u2019t want anyone\nelse to see. Even the passers-by who\nwould in the past have just muttered\nto themselves and walked away now\ntweets and shares their experiences,\nmaking it impossible to keep these\nembarrassing and often troubling\nincidents within the Imperial bubble.\nIs this a good thing? Well, yes. Even\nthough it is deeply embarrassing for\nThe Union Bar just isn't what it used to be. Photo: brianmay.com\nNICK FARMER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nus all to have the good name of our\nbeloved University dragged through\nthe mud, the accountability of the\n21st century means that normal,\nresponsible students are more likely\nto be able to enjoy a night out at a\nUnion bar or a sports club social\nwithout getting into a fight, being\npressured into nude drinking games,\nor in any other way being affected by\na toxic culture of antisocial, violent\nand intimidating behavior.\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill for us to swallow,\nbut at the end of the day it is\nmedicine.\nCrime Scene: Memory Lane\n\"...the Union\nPresident was\nutterly, utterly,\nutterly fucked\"\n\n"

India has demanded \u00a326m in\ndamages from the West Indies cricket\nboard, after the West Indies players\u2019\nstrike led to a premature end to the\nWindies\u2019 tour.\nThis weekend marks the beginning\nof the Autumn International\nseason in Rugby Union.

The race\nwas saturated with on-track action\nwith wheel to wheel racing and daring\novertakes commonplace. The final\nresult had Lewis Hamilton atop the\npodium for Mercedes followed in\nby his team mate Nico Rosberg and\nRed Bull Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo.\nOne noticeable difference to previous\nraces this season was the reduced line\nup of just 18 cars as opposed to the\nnormal 22. Backmarkers Caterham\nand Marussia were not present at\nthe Grand Prix after both teams fell\ninto administration during the two\nweek break after Sochi. While their\nabsence did not have a large impact\non the outcome of the race or the\nexcitement of the spectacle, it has\nserved to highlight the extremely\nexpensive nature of the sport and the\nfine financial margins that teams,\nespecially the smaller ones, work to.\nSunday\u2019s field of cars was the\nsmallest seen at a Grand Prix since\nMonaco in 2005 when the British\nAmerican Racing team (were serving\na ban for infringing the regulations.\nAll three of the new teams introduced\nto the sport in 2010 have since\ndisappeared from the grid with HRT\nhaving been unable to find a buyer\nat the end of the 2012 season. The\npotential for an even smaller grid\nof cars is a realistic possibility as\nother teams have been struggling\nwith finance during this year \u2013 most\nnotably Sauber Ferrari and Sahara\nForce India.\nThe sport cannot afford to lose\nteams in the way it has in recent\nyears. It damages the level of\ncompetition and will dent the\nattendances at races accordingly.\nSmaller teams also provide a stepping\nstone into the sport and often find\nthe greatest talent. For example, 2007\nWorld Champion and Ferrari driver\nKimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen started his career at\nSauber. Another issue is the contracts\nin place for the races which state that\nFormula 1 will provide a minimum\nof 16 cars for each event. This means\nthat if the problems are not resolved,\nsome teams may be obliged to run a\nthird car, once again narrowing the\ncompetition.\nThe underlying problem is that\nthe amount of money received\nby the smaller teams from\nBernie Ecclestone\u2019s Formula\nOne Management company is\nsignificantly less than the amount\nrequired to run a competitive team.\nThe sum of money that each team\nreceives every year is dictated by\ntheir finishing position in the\nconstructors\u2019 championship of the\nprevious year. The amount of money\ngiven to each team is not disclosed\nto the public but it is believed that\nMarussia received around \u00a39million\nfor this year whilst Caterham, for\nfinishing 10th\n, received about double\nthat. This is in comparison to the\nestimated \u00a375million required to\nfund a midfield team.\nSome of the disparity between\nthese values can be made up through\nsponsorship deals and private\ninvestment but a team at the back\nof the grid will rarely attract big\nsponsors.\nThe distribution of money is also\nvery uneven. For finishing third in\nthe championship in 2013, Ferrari\nare believed to have been paid\n\u00a3125million with almost half of that\nbeing paid just for turning up on the\ngrid. The difference in net income\nbetween teams means that it is almost\nimpossible for the smaller teams to\nout-develop the larger teams and\nhence overtake them in the world\nchampionship. To compound this,\nonly the largest teams sit on the board\nthat decides on team spending with\nthe likes of Ferrari and Mercedes\nvetoing proposed cost caps within the\nsport.\nFormula 1 is suffering from a\nmanagerial crisis that is preventing\nthe smaller teams from having\ntheir voices heard whilst the largest\nteams use their power to maintain\nthe unfair nature of spending in the\nsport to benefit their title chances.\nUndoubtedly Formula 1 is too\nexpensive for teams to survive on the\nlittle money that they are given.\nUnless this problem is resolved, the\ngrid risks losing even more teams and\nbecoming even more of a procession.\nMarussia and Caterham have gone into administration. Could more follow them? Photo: James Moy/PA\nHENRY LAMBLEY\nSPORTS WRITER\n\n"

Yet while the cost\nof a trip is certainly far lower than the\ntens of millions that space tourists\nhave paid for a ride on a Soyuz to\nthe International Space Station\n(ISS), it still remains affordable\nonly to celebrities and wealthy\nbusiness people with several orders\nof magnitude more money than they\nknow what to do with.\nWill future generations really see\nthis as the start of a new dawn in\nspaceflight, or just a pointless and\nextravagant white elephant?\nBranson\u2019s unimaginatively named\nSpaceShipTwo (operated by the\ninaccurately named Virgin \u2018Galactic\u2019)\nhas several significant innovations\nthat make it rather different to\nconventional space launch systems.\nInstead of taking off using rockets,\nSpaceShipTwo is first attached to a\nplane and released when it reaches a\nhigh enough altitude.\nFrom there it travels to space using\nits own small rockets. When it\u2019s time\nto come back to earth, the rear part\nof the wing folds up, slowing the craft\ndown and avoiding the enormous\ntemperatures experienced by the heat\nshields of conventional spacecraft.\nThis approach dramatically reduces\nthe costs involved, and mean that the\nentire setup is completely reusable.\nVirgin Galactic isn\u2019t the only\ncompany trying to commercialise\nspace travel though. Two companies\nVirgin Galactic's SpeceShipTwo under the carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nTravelling to space on a budget?\nJames Bezer looks at the future of commercial space light\nhave set (massively over-)ambitious\ndeadlines to send people to Mars.\nDennis Tito\u2019s Inspiration Mars is\nplanning a 500 day return trip for\ntwo astronauts to fly around Mars\nin 2018. Mars One is planning to\nnot only land people on the surface\nin 2024, but also set up a permanent\ncolony there, while filming it all\nfor a reality TV programme. Their\nbudget is just 6 billion dollars, vastly\nless than the 100 billion estimated by\nNASA for a similar project.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m\nvery doubtful that either of these\nprojects will ever happen.\nOne company though, has\nproven that private companies can\nsuccessfully carry out space flight\nin the long term. Founded in 2002\nby Elon Musk, the South African\nbillionaire behind PayPal, SpaceX\nhas developed a successful rocket\nand a spacecraft, Dragon, which has\nalready been used to launch satellites\nand transport cargo to the ISS, and\nis intended to be used in the future\nto carry astronauts. What SpaceX\nhas already achieved makes even\nthe most outlandish goals set out by\nVirgin Galactic seem quite trivial.\nAnd yet, unlike those planning\nmissions to Mars, what both these\ncompanies appreciate is that for space\ntravel to progress, there must be a\nsustainable business model behind\nit. Since the end of the space race and\nthe cold war, space has changed from\nthe final frontier to be conquered to\nsomething we can use and develop to\nimprove our lives through enhanced\ncommunications and navigation.\nBut as governments become\nweary of spending tens of billions\nof dollars on such huge projects,\ncommercialising seems the only\nway that humans will ever make\nspace travel truly sustainable and\naffordable in the long term. Perhaps\nwe could finally achieve those lofty\nambitions of a permanent presence\non Mars, or mining comets for\nminerals that are rare on earth.\nI just don\u2019t think the way to do this\nis with the world\u2019s most expensive\nroller coaster.\nShare your views at felixonline.\nco.uk/science\n\"Will future\ngenerations\nsee this as\na pointless\nwhite\nelephant?\"\n\"For space\ntravel to\nprogress,\nit needs a\nbusiness\nmodel\nbehind it.\"\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9\n07.11.2014\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFree speech, censorship, and backbone\nfor the easily offended\nWhy bother writing an\narticle about free speech\ntoday in Britain? We no\nlonger ban books \u2013 surely freedom of\nspeech is a concern of the past.\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\nJust last month, the Barbican planned\nto launch an art exhibition based on\na \u2018human zoo\u2019 of the type that were\ncommon for wealthy Europeans\nto view right up until just over a\nhundred years ago. It contained\nblack actors chained and in cages,\nwho were to keep eye contact with\nthe visitors as they entered one by\none into the gallery. It was intended\nto be a reminder of the imperialism\nand slavery that were realities not so\nlong ago in this country, as well as to\nstart a discussion about the continued\nexploitation of Africa\u2019s resources\ntoday. However, due to a protest and\npetition, the exhibit was seen as too\noffensive and never opened.\nWould anyone really have walked\naround what was clearly meant to\nbe an uncomfortable and shocking\nspectacle and thought \u2018yep, slavery\nwas a great idea\u2019?\nWho are these people who are so\neasily offended, or so easily led that\nan art exhibit they voluntarily signed\nup to see would have caused them\nto do anything other than reflect on\nsome of the more awful parts of our\nhistory?\nThis is not a one-off example. It\nis true that we no longer have to\nfear government censorship, but\ncensorship of a much more dangerous\nkind is on the rise. We are censoring\nourselves for fear of causing offense.\nThis applies particularly to\nUniversities. They are meant to be\nplaces of discussion where all ideas\ncan be openly talked about. Instead,\nthe National Union of Students and\nindividual Universities themselves\nare regularly banning things that\nthey deem offensive, partly through\nthe No-Platform policy, which\nallows Student Unions to ban people\nwith views they deem unacceptable\nfrom speaking at events around the\nuniversity.\nThe idea of such a policy, no\nmatter the good intentions behind it,\ncompletely misses the point of why\nfreedom of speech is so vital. Even if\nthe speaker banned was a ludicrous\nsexist who came to the university\nto actively promote sexism, surely\nit would be better to challenge that\nspeaker openly rather than push\nuncomfortable truths into the dark,\nwhere they don\u2019t go away.\nSome people are racist, sexist,\nhomophobic etc. Stopping them\nsaying it in some areas of the public\nisn\u2019t going to stop that. It won\u2019t even\nprevent them finding followers,\nwhen anyone can have a blog, or get\naccess to some truly vile internet\ncommunities where any horrible\nopinion you happen to be tempted by\nwill be endorsed.\nRestriction of debate on any\nissue implies that what people are\nsaying in opposition is so powerful\nor distressing or significant that it\nsimply cannot be discussed. It implies\nthat the \u2018acceptable\u2019 opinion is flimsy\nand cannot stand up to argument.\nThis is why we need to be sensible\nin public life, at University and\nelsewhere, and trust people to be able\nto have healthy debates on difficult\nissues.\nThis is a difficult topic. Most people\nhave a place where they would find\nit easy to draw the line and refuse to\nhear other\u2019s opinions \u2013 be it at the\nidea of a pro-life stand at a Freshers\u2019\nFair, someone suggesting that a rape\nvictim brought it on themselves, or\nsomeone tweeting abuse at Madeleine\nMcCann\u2019s parents. Accepting free\nspeech means that you are going to\nencounter the most horrific opinions.\nHowever, censoring it, sending people\nto jail for what is just an opinion can\nonly lead to worse things.\nAs Spiked, an online magazine\nthat runs a campaign for freedom\nof speech says, free speech is the\n\u201cfoundational freedom upon which\nevery other right we enjoy \u2013 from\nthe right to vote to the right to\nprotest \u2013 is built. Without the\nfreedom to think, write, publish,\ndepict, and debate as we see fit, all\nour political and social rights become\nmeaningless.\u201d\nA couple of weekends ago at\nthe Battle of Ideas, an event\nthat champions open debate,\nWORLDwrites, a citizen TV charity,\nlaunched a free speech helpline. It\ndoesn\u2019t offer sympathy or counselling\nfor those offended though - it is\nintended for people who don\u2019t want\nto be victims, and offers backbone.\nHelpline organiser Marisa Pereira\nsaid: \u201cThe Free Speech Helpline will\nencourage people to stand up for\nthemselves. The curtailment of free\nspeech is so often justified today on\nthe basis we are all too vulnerable to\ncope with it, especially women and\nminorities. But this does no one any\nfavours \u2013 it just drives backward\nideas underground, leaving them\nunchallenged.\u201d\nFree speech does mean\nencountering deeply unpleasant\nopinions, and questioning your own\nworldview, but it\u2019s the only option\nthere is in a truly democratic society.\nThe Free Speech Helpline is available\non 0208 525 7912.\nIs this too offensive? Photo: Guardian\nEMMA WILLS\nCOMMENT WRITER\n\"...surely it\nwould be better\nto challenge\nthat speaker\nopenly rather\nthan to push\nuncomfortable\ntruths into the\ndark\"\n\"We are\ncensoring\nourselves\nfor fear\nof causing\noffense\"\n\"...it is\nintended\nfor people\nwho don't\nwant\nto be\nvictims,\nand offers\nbackbone\"\n\n"

    "content": "Sport Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIssue 1587\nPositive start to the season for Women\u2019s Rugby\nWith the graduation of so\nmany of our senior girls\nlast year, this season was\nalways going to be about rebuilding\nand bringing new players into\nthe squad. With that in mind we\nthought it important to get a new\ncoach. We were pleased that we\nhired Stewart Mcguire who, with age\ngrade international caps for Wales\nand Ireland and currently playing\nfor London Scottish, has brought\nenthusiasm and a lot of fun to\ntraining.\nTo our delight we had a great\nturnout to our taster session with\nover 30 new faces giving rugby a\ntry. In the sunshine at Harlington\neveryone seemed to be getting really\nstuck in and enjoying the basis of the\ngame. This was followed by a BBQ\nwhere new and old faces chatted and\ngot to know each other.\nOur first match of the season came\nalong two weeks later against Royal\nVeterinary College in LUSL. Being\nundefeated in LUSL last year put a bit\nof pressure on the new girls who were\nstill getting to grips with the game.\nHowever, after some good training\nunder their belts, nine new players\nfelt confident enough to play their\nfirst match for IC.\nPeople were clearly nervous in the\nfirst ten minutes or so with a few\ndropped passes and minor errors.\nThe first try of the season went to\ndebutante Emily Moran playing in the\ncentre, who after some strong rucking\nby the forwards and some quick ball\nbroke through the line to score. This\nseemed to settle the nerves for IC\nand balls started to go to hand more.\nThis gave our Gaelic football convert\nEimear Nolan the chance to show off\nher skills scoring twice more in quick\nsuccession. Towards the end of the\nfirst half we were camped on their\nline again but they had the put into\nthe scrum after a knock on. With the\nscrum going well, one went against\nthe head which enabled our number\n8, Charlie Stephens, to rumble over\nfrom a few meters, leaving the half\ntime score 22-0.\nThe second half gave us the\nopportunity to bring on even more\nnew girls and move people around in\ntheir positions a bit. This provided\nthem with great experience and\nenabled people to find out where\ntheir best position would be. In the\nfirst 20 minutes of the second half,\nRVC upped their intensity, with\nno-one gaining much superiority in\nany aspect of the game. However, one\nsloppy kick from their number 10\ngave our full back, Sammy Ardi, the\nchance to counter with a searing run\nthrough their disorganised defence\nto score under the posts and break\nthe second half sale mate. They hit\nback and after a couple of missed\ntackles from IC they too were under\nthe posts, leaving the final score\n27-7 to us. Back of the match went to\nEimear Nolan, after her two superb\ntries especially given it was her first\never game, with forward of the match\ngoing to Charlie Stephens.\nWith barely time for the bruises to\nfade from our first match, we faced\nUCL three days later for the start of\nour BUCS campaign. Confidence was\nstill high after RVC, meaning even\nmore girls were eager to get stuck into\ntheir first game, and we were able to\ntake a full squad of 22 for the first\ntime in years!\nWe started reasonably well with\nFrederike Jaeger scoring the first try\nof the match with us dominating\nterritory and possession.\nUnfortunately we were struck\nby injuries to key players with our\nnumber 10, 12 and 13 all going off\nwithin the first 25 minutes, meaning\nwe had to completely change our\nback line, putting people out of\nposition and bringing new girls in\nearlier than we would have expected.\nWe competed well upfront and won\nnearly every scrum regardless of\nwho put the ball in, meaning we were\nstill on top with the territory and\npossession.\nHandling errors and turnovers\nseemed to be our nemesis and when\nthey got it to their back line their\nexperience showed with their 13\nand 14 both scoring twice, with\ntheir 11 and 10 having a try each.\nWe managed to hit back, firstly\nCharlie Stephens reports on games against RVC and rivals UCL\nPhoto: IC Women's Rugby\nPhoto: IC Women's Rugby\nPhoto: IC Women's Rugby\nthrough our captain Kath Fok, who\nsaw they were slow to re-organise\ntheir defensive line after a penalty.\nShe tapped quickly and ran half the\nlength of the pitch to score again for\nIC.\nOur final score of the match went to\nCharlie who picked and went off the\nback of some solid rucking, making\nthe final score 36-21 to UCL. Back\nof the match went to Hannah Scott,\nwho ended up playing nearly every\nposition in the back line at some\npoint, but handled it really well,\nwith forward of the match going to\nCharlie.\nAll in all, even with the\ndisappointment of the UCL match, it\nhas been a good start to the season for\nwomen\u2019s rugby. The defence of our\nLUSL title has started well and we are\nconfident that, with a bit more luck\non our side, we will be able to take the\nnext game against UCL when we play\nthem in January.\nOur next match sees us taking on\nthe unknown of St. Marys in BUCS,\nwhere we hope to put the loss of UCL\nbehind us.\nWe always welcome new players at\nany point in the term, whether you\nhave played before or not.\nSo if you fancy giving women\u2019s\nrugby a go email Mona our club\npresident (mona.hussein10@imperial.\nac.uk) for more details.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 33\n07.11.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n2012 was a good year for Japanese\nartist Yayoi Kusama. With a\ncareer that spans more than six\ndecades, and ranges from painting\nto performance art, her hard work\nwas rewarded with not just one, but\ntwo retrospectives, held on either\nside of the Atlantic. The Whitney\nMuseum in New York City played\nhost to a number of her polka-dotted\ncreations, while the Tate Modern\u2019s\nexhibition proved to be one of the\nhighlights of that summer.\nNot only did she garner critical\nacclaim that year, but she also\nreleased a range of handbags and\naccessories in collaboration with\nfashion brand Louis Vuitton, a\nsomewhat odd move for an artist\nwho was so crucial for the formation\nof the Feminist Art movement. The\nprice for one of these customised\nhandbags? $3,600. While the price\nmay make you screw up your eyes,\nyou can console yourself with the fact\nthat in 2008 one of her works sold at\nChristie's for $5.1 million, setting a\nrecord for living women artists. But\neven if the bag represents a good deal\nin comparison, it \u2013 along with many\nother such collaborations \u2013 leaves a\nbad taste in my mouth.\nIn order to understand the\nrelationship between artists and\nfashion designers, a meshing of\nideas that can be both symbiotic and\ndestructive, we need to go back to the\nswinging sixties. 1965 in particular;\nthe year that French designer Yves\nSaint Laurent released his celebrated\n\u2018Piet Mondrian\u2019 dresses that went\non to define an era. Taking their\ninspiration from the Dutch founder\nof Neoplasticism, Saint Laurent\nstitched together patches of colourful\nwool jersey, separated by thick black\nlines, evoking modern masterpieces.\nHowever, as much as people may laud\nthis as the beginning of collaboration,\nMondrian died in 1944, when young\nSaint Laurent was only eight. In\nactuality, he was merely \u2018inspired\u2019 by\nthe paintings of Mondrian, and no\nformal collaboration took place.\nFast-forward to 1974, and we find\nYves Saint Laurent tangled up in\nanother collaboration, this time more\nauthentic. It was this year that Andy\nWarhol, whose involvement in the\nworld of fashion and industry was\nalmost a given, created a silk screen\npainting of Saint Laurent, pensively\nstaring out of the canvas in candy-floss tones. From then on the die\nwas cast, and the worlds of fashion\nand fine art aligned, coming closer\nand closer, until they seemed to\nspectacularly crash together.\nBy the 1990s the line between\ncreativity and commercialism\nwas destroyed \u2013 perhaps thanks to\nthe legacy of Thatcher\u2019s economic\npolicies \u2013 making art as disposable\nas quick fashion; evidence of cultural\nawareness was no longer about what\nyou read, but what you wore, and\nartistic appreciation became as simple\nas buying a new coat.\nIt is difficult to find anyone who\nencapsulates this trend better than\nDamien Hirst, that enfant terrible\n90s hangover, whose work manages to\nbe both \u2018aggressively confrontational\u2019\nand still completely marketable.\nLast year saw a collaboration\nbetween Hirst and the fashion house\nAlexander McQueen, resulting in a\nrange of scarves costing up to \u00a3715.\nAnd yet this is not the worst example\nof the gaucheness of Hirst\u2019s output;\nthat dubious honour would belong to\nhis relationship with Beck\u2019s Beer, for\nwhom he designed a special edition\nbottle in 1995 as part of their Art\nLabel campaign. The campaign was\nlaunched in 1987, with the first label\ndesigned by British duo Gilbert &\nGeorge; what did Beck\u2019s do to deserve\nthis fine honour? They sponsored a\nretrospective at the Hayward Gallery\nthat same year. The relationship\nbetween art and industry is so\nobvious it would almost be amusing.\nIt was not just Gilbert & George\nand Hirst who took up the mantle of\nBeck\u2019s. Numerous artists, including\na contingent of the YBA group \u2013\nTracey Emin, Rachel Whiteread et\nal \u2013 agreed to design labels for the\nbottle, and in the process reduced fine\nart \u2013 quite literally \u2013 to a consumable.\nI understand that the artists have a\nright to choose what art they make,\nand with whom, but these kinds of\nYves Saint Laurent - Andy Warhol. 1974 Photo: Creative Commons\nWhen Art and Fashion\nCollide: An Exploration\nof the History of the\nRelationship Between\nFine Art, Fashion, and\nCommerce by Fred Fyles\n\"In order to\nunderstand\nthis\nrelationship\nwe need to\ngo back to\nthe Swinging\nSixties\"\n\"It is hard\nto find\nthe worst\nexample\nof Damien\nHirst's\ngaucheness\"\nThe 2012 Collaboration between Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama and Louis Vuitton.

The competition sees teams\nfrom hundreds of Universities\nbioengineer products using synthetic\nbiology techniques and pits their\nideas against each other in a giant\nconference held in the USA.\nThe Global Jamboree, held in\nBoston, Massachusetts, took place\nlast week from October 30th\nto November the 3rd, and 245\nUniversity teams took part. It marked\nthe tenth anniversary of the iGEM\ncompetition.\nUniversities from all over the world\nenter the competition; there were 82\nteams from Asia, 67 from Europe, 14\nfrom Latin America and 84 teams\nfrom North America.\nImperial\u2019s team won multiple\nprizes including Best Part Collection\n(that recognised the use of additional\nelements that are added to products,\nlike fluorescent or metal elements),\nBest Manufacturing Project, and are\nwere finalists in the Undergraduate\ncategory; they came number two\nin the World, second to a team\nin Germany, Heidelberg, which\npresented a \u201chighly technical\u201d project\non proteins.\nThe Imperial iGEM 2014 team\nproject, called Aqualose, consisted\nof Undergraduates from various\ndepartments across Imperial. The\nteam of nine students and their\nsupervisor, Ben Reeve, a PhD student,\noverseen by the Centre of Synthetic\nBiology and Innovation, spent the\nsummer in the lab working on their\nproject, and then pitched their idea\nat the Jamboree in front of the other\ncompeting teams.\nThe team focused on manipulating\nbacterial cellulose to produce water\nfilter membranes. Upon genetically\nmodifying Escherichia coli to produce\nthe bacterial cellulose, they were\nable to mass-produce the cellulose\nthat could be used to augment water\nrecycling on a local and industrial\nscale. They modified the cellulose\nwith binding proteins, allowing\ndifferent contaminants to be filtered\nout of water as needed.\nThe Imperial teams have\ntraditionally done very well in the\npast in the iGEM competition, with\nthe team last year reaching the final\nstages and coming second runners\nup. The 2011 team were the European\nchampions, and came in as the first\nrunners up overall.\nDr Tom Ellis, a Senior Lecturer\nin the Centre for Synthetic Biology\nand Innovation and a Supervisor of\nthe team, \u201cThe team were great to\nwork with and work incredibly hard,\nconsidering all their big results came\nin the last two months.\n\u201cThey put in an amazing amount\nof time and effort over the summer.\nThey were so enthusiastic and kept\nsmiling the entire time.\u201d\n\u201cThey were working with a tangible\nproduct you could hold in your hand,\nand this was handed out during the\npresentation at Boston, which was\nexciting. We are very proud of their\nsuccess.\u201d\nFelix spoke to two of the team\nmembers: Michael Florea who studies\nBiology, and Gabriella Santosa who\nstudies Biochemistry. Michael told\nus about how they came up with the\nidea.\n\u201cWe started the project in July,\nand spent about three weeks\nbrainstorming ideas. We had three\nmain ideas, and our supervisor helped\nus pick one that really fit with the\ncriteria of the competition.\nWe finally set on an idea everyone\nwas happy with, and one that was\nfeasible in the time scale we had.\u201d\nGabriella said: \u201cOne of the big\nideas behind iGEM and one that is\nimportant at Imperial too is \u2018Saving\nthe World\u2019. We wanted to develop an\nidea that is accessible to people and\nsomething people on the street would\nappreciate.\u201d\nOf their trip to Boston, Michael\ntold us how the work didn\u2019t stop once\nthey arrived. \u201cWe arrived during\nHalloween and managed to squeeze\nin a party then!\n\u201cWe also spoke to a lot of other\nteams there and it was great to be able\nto discuss ideas.\u201d\nThe iGEM Giant Jamboree\nmarked the tenth anniversary of the\ncompetition, and allowed all teams\nfrom all stages of the competition to\nattend. In previous years, only those\nthat pass a regional round make it to\nthe Boston conference.\nGabriella told us, \u201cIt was great that\nall the teams were competing at once,\nso we could see everyone\u2019s projects.\nSome projects wouldn\u2019t have made\nit out of the regionals due to time\nconstraints and other elements out of\ntheir control, but still are based on a\ngreat idea that is worth sharing.\u201d\nMany of the team members are still\nstateside, enjoying New York and\nsocializing with the other teams now\nthe competition has ended.\nThey are also enjoying looking\naround Biology labs in New York, as\napparently a whole summer working\nin labs was not enough for this\nhardworking team.\nThe results of the project will be\nused in the future as a foundation for\nfurther research, such as the genomes\nthe team sequenced from the bacteria\nthat created the cellulose.\nPhilippa Skett talks to the team on their synthetic biology triumph\nThe contestants at the Jamboree in Boston, USA.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 19\n07.11.2014\nFELIX\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk Tech Editors Jamie Dutton & Osama Awara\nA breath of fresh air in an old and stale industry\nElectric car enthusiasts appearing ecstatic at the unveiling of the first Model S at the Tesla factory in June 2012. Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nChrysostomos Meli discusses the revolution of automobiles lead by Tesla\n\"[Elon\nMusk] is an\nentrepreneur\nwho is no\nstranger to\ninnovation\"\nYou don\u2019t have to be a\npetrolhead to know that the\nautomobile industry hasn\u2019t\nbeen the most innovative over the\nyears. Since the introduction of\nthe Model T in 1908, the car has\nremained largely unchanged. It might\nhave become faster, more reliable\nand more efficient over those 100\nyears but no radical new ideas have\nmanaged to take hold.\nAnd why should they? People are\ngenerally pleased with the way their\ncars work, and as a result companies\naren\u2019t incentivised to change. But\ndespite what consumers think, there\nare fundamental problems with the\nway we get around: congestion, long\ncommuting, safety, and the biggest of\nall \u2013 fuel consumption.\nOur addiction to fossil fuels is\nslowly but surely killing our planet,\nbut companies around the world are\nfighting to bring change and electric\ncar company Tesla is leading the\ncharge.\nUnderstanding the logic and\nambition behind Tesla requires that\nyou first understand its founder\nand CEO Elon Musk. The man\nbehind; PayPal, the company that\nrevolutionised digital payments;\nSolarCity, an energy provider trying\nto bring renewable energy into the\nmainstream; and SpaceX, a rocket\nmanufacturer leading the way in the\nrace to privatise space travel. He is\nan entrepreneur who is no stranger\nto innovation. He is currently valued\nat $9.6 billion and his goal in life\nseems to be to continuously push the\nlimits of humanity\u2019s technological\nambitions.\nTesla is very much one of those\nambitions. The company was founded\nin 2003 and its ultimate goal is\nto produce an electric vehicle for\nthe average consumer: Certainly a\nconcept easier said than done. Due\nto the infancy of their technology,\nbatteries for their cars are sold at a\nsimilar price to that of an average\npetrol automobile.\nAs a result, the company, which\nunlike other automakers is at its core\na child of Silicon Valley, opted to\nadopt a strategy that was very popular\namongst tech companies: Start off\nby selling high end products aimed\nat the wealthier consumer and as\nyour technology matures and your\nmanufacturing capabilities grow,\nrelease ever cheaper products aimed\nat the wider public.\nThe company\u2019s first car, the Tesla\nRoadster, was a battery powered\nsports car. Released in 2008, it was\nthe first of its kind and the very first\nall-electric vehicle to travel more\nthan 200 miles per charge. However,\nlooming over the car was a hefty price\ntag of \u00a386,950.\nThe same trend continued in 2012\nwith the introduction of the Model\nS, the luxury sedan competing in a\nmarket ruled by petrol giants such as\nBMW and Mercedes. The base model\nis currently priced at \u00a350,000 and\nis capable of 285 miles per charge \u2013\ntopping its predecessor\u2019s record.\nDespite the stiff competition, the\ncar has sold incredibly well across\nevery market it was introduced in.\nIt was even responsible for Tesla\u2019s\nfirst ever positive quarterly revenue\nreport in ten years, bringing in profits\nof $11.2 million in May 2013. That\nmight not sound like much, but from\nthat point on investors have looked\nat the company as a market leader\nrather than an outsider, helping its\nstock price to skyrocket over the last\nyear.\nTesla\u2019s philosophy isn\u2019t to sell\nbattery-powered cars just because\nthey believe they are better for the\nenvironment, they want to sell\nbattery-powered cars because they\nbelieve they are better\u2026 period.\nThis couldn\u2019t be more apparent\nwith Musk\u2019s announcement earlier\nthis month in California. The\ncompany is bringing some very\nexiting changes to its Model S line.\nThe car\u2019s top-of-the-line models now\ncome with an extra D in their name,\nwhich stands for double motors - one\nfor the front wheels and one for the\nback. This, coupled with a very fast\ndigital power management system\nbetween the two motors, has given\nthe car an acceleration boost that is\ntreading into supercar territory. The\ntop of the line Model S P85D is able\nto accelerate from 0-60 miles per\nhour in 3.2 seconds. To put that in\nperspective, this is the same time it\ntakes the new Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n\nto reach 62 miles per hour from a\nstanding start.\nBut insane acceleration was not the\nonly thing Musk pulled out of his\nhat that day. Tesla introduced the\nmost advanced autonomous driving\nsystem you are currently legally able\nto use on the street. By retrofitting\nits vehicles with 3 different types of\nsensors, it is able to drive by itself\non the highway, monitoring and\nresponding to everything around it.\nThis brings Tesla on-par with what\nother manufacturers are offering for\ntheir cars with one exception \u2013 you\ncan get out of your Model S and it\ncan park itself at your home. You can\neven hail it when on private property\nand it will come to you with the air-conditioning on and your favorite\ntunes playing on the stereo.\nTesla still has a long way to go\nbefore it convinces everyone that\nelectric-powered cars are the way\nto go, but judging from the shear\namount of electric vehicles coming\nout from its otherwise petrol-driven\ncompetitors, the smell of change, as\nopposed to burning petrol, is in the\nair.\n\"Tesla\nintroduced\nthe most\nadvanced\nautonomous\ndriving\nsystem\nyou are\ncurrently\nlegally able\nto use on\nthe street\"\n\n"

Last Sunday around 15 of\nus headed to the fancy Moroccan\nand Lebanese restaurant Maison\nTouareg, located in the heart of Soho.\nAfter getting extra cosy with the\nother society members due to the\nlack of appropriate seating for the\nover-sold show, we tucked into\nvarious delicious mezze dishes. Let\nme tell you \u2013 there\u2019s something\nrather satisfying about gorging\nyourself whilst watching professional\ndancers of all sizes athletically (yet\nstill gracefully) twirl around an\nimpossibly small stage.\nThe dancers themselves were not\nlacking in variety, with one coming\nall the way from Russia, others not\nso far away in Birmingham, and a\nfew London circuit regulars. The\nacts were full of glitz, glam and\nsparkles, and offered a variety of\nMiddle Eastern cultural references;\nfrom traditional Baladi style to more\nmodern Arabic pop music, with\none dancer even pirouetting along\nto a song featuring Snoop Dogg!\nWe were treated further with some\nwonderful Indian fusion belly dance\nfrom Monica and Heena, which was\na lovely, introspective break from\nthe cabaret spectacle of the previous\ndancers of the night, which I feel\nepitomised the sheer versatility of the\nLondon belly dancing community.\nNever really knew that he could dance like this\nYasmin Malik and IC Belly Dancing gets close and personal with Sunny the Shake Boy\nThe night also featured live tabla\ndrummer Sallam, who could be\nseen skillfully tapping away all\nevening with a cheeky smile. He\neven provided the rhythm for\nseveral entertaining improvisational\ndances by Arabic Night organizer\nSarah Malik, making the best of a\npotentially awkward situation when\nthe sound system went down.\nBy far the most entertaining act\nof the night was Sunny the Snake\nBoy, male belly dancer and comp\u00e8re\nextraordinaire. His act involved\ndancing on the tables, stealing one\nbelly dancing society member\u2019s\nphone and shoving it down his\nskirt (yep, you read correctly!) and\ntwerking on various members of\nthe audience. He single-handedly\nwhipped up a raucous atmosphere in\nthe restaurant as he introduced each\nact, and he even challenged me to a\nbelly-off in the interval. Belly Dance\nsociety members will be pleased to\nknow that I did my best to compete!\nArabic Night is an excellent way\nto get an authentic taste of Middle\nEastern dance culture, and the\natmosphere is that of a big welcoming\nfamily. I sincerely recommend\nthis event for anyone looking for a\nfast track induction into the world\nof belly dancing. The evening was\nenjoyed by new and old members, and\nby men and women alike.\nThe next Arabic Night will be held on\nthe 14th December at Maison Touareg,\nSoho.

Some having\nalready passed through check in\nthe rest of us hurried to security,\nwhich was to delay us for far longer\nthan anticipated, with one member\nhaving to have their bag unpacked\nand swept not once, but twice, due to\na highly suspicious item\u2026 a GoPro\nhandle (apparently they look like they\ncontain liquid on X-ray).\nA long but uneventful flight\nlater, we arrived in Fuerteventura\nto be greeted by two of the more\neccentric staff of the Deep Blue Dive\nCentre, which was to be the base\nof our diving. They then drove us\nand our vast quantities of kit to our\naccommodation, where we dropped\nour stuff and went in search of food.\nThe next five days were spent\nlargely sleeping, diving, and eating,\nas well as watching the world cup\nsemi-finals and final. Diving at a\nGerman run dive centre, the results\nwere far more important than I had\nanticipated when planning the trip.\nBarracuda, the World Cup, and suspicious GoPros\nFortunately everything went the\nright way and we ended up with very\nhappy guides.\nThere were a variety of dive sites\nwith fantastic visibility meaning that\nall the sites could be seen in all their\nglory. A huge amount of wildlife\nwas seen including many octopi,\ncuttlefish, barracuda, fire worms,\nshoals of sardines, and eels.\nThere were also several varieties\nof coral; one green one looking like\nan upturned Christmas tree was\nparticularly striking. The weather\nand water temperature of a warm\n21\u00b0C were a pleasant change from the\nEaster trip to Cornwall.\nOne member also completed their\nonline work induction for a job\nstarting on the Monday after the trip.\nMany thanks to the staff at the\nDeep Blue Dive centre for making it a\nfantastic trip!\n\"apparently\nthey look\nlike they\ncontain\nliquid on an\nX-ray\"\n\"The\nweather\nand water\ntemperature\n... were a\npleasant\nchange from\nthe Easter\ntrip\"\nIt is rumoured that one of the divers in this picture was celebrating a\nworld cup result.

The team were instead picked\nup from Hammersmith Apollo at\naround 18:00 on Wednesday evening\n(29th October) and taken straight to\nBristol.\nImperial College Union found out\nabout the incident the following\nmorning around 08:00, and by\nmidday the whole of Imperial\nMedicals were suspended and told to\nreturn home as early as possible.\nThe rugby team has already paid\n\u00a35000 towards the costs of the\ndamages done on the coach, as a\n\u201cgesture\u201d, although this is unlikely\nto cover all of the losses made by\nthe company. The \u00a35000 is thought\nto have come from the pockets of\nmembers themselves, and any further\ncosts will have to be covered by the\nfunds held by the team as a whole.\nThe window alone has cost \u00a32500\nto replace and the bus was rendered\nunusable for a week. The company\nis also keen to recover any loss of\nearnings that could have been made\nduring this period.\nAfter incorporating other damages\ndone to the coach, alongside the\nloss of earnings from having to take\nthe vehicle off the road, the source\nfrom the company said that the total\ndamages would be closer to \u00a310,000.\nThe team paid \u00a3850 for the coach\nhire and a further \u00a3500 to travel back\nto Bristol on Thursday evening. The\ncoach company told Felix that the\nImperial Medicals would struggle to\nbook a coach in the future. \u201cThey\u2019ve\nbeen blacklisted with every company\nin the industry.\n\u201cNo-one will let them hire a vehicle,\nand we will certainly be turning them\naway in the future.\u201d\nThe Imperial Medicals declined to\ncomment.\nThe tour, known as The School\u2019s\nTour, takes place during October\nevery year. The team initially\nplanned to return on the 31st in\ntime for the Halloween Bop at the\nReynolds Bar. Tickets for the tour\nwere priced at \u00a375 per person.\nThis follows on from the incidents\nthat also took place last Wednesday\nwith the Imperial College Rugby\nteam, who were seen to be stripping\non tube platforms and disrupted a\nDistrict Line train. With two of the\nmain rugby teams now suspended, it\nhas not been confirmed that Varsity\nwill continue as in previous years\nwith IC Rugby playing the Imperial\nMedicals.\nImperial College Union President,\nTom Wheeler, gave Felix the\nfollowing statement on the future\nof the Imperial Medicals: \u201cI have led\nan investigation into the incidents\nregarding the Imperial College\nMedicals Rugby Club and a decision\nwill be made during an emergency\nmeeting of the Board of Trustees\nGovernance Committee on Tuesday\n11 November.\u201d\nTom Wheeler also sent an email\nto all Club Officers on Monday,\nreminding students of the\nconsequences of such anti-social\nbehaviour.\n\u201cIt gravely concerns me that these\nactivities are considered acceptable\nand that the sanctions that I am\nadministering are considered\n\u2018harsh\u2019. I therefore feel it would be an\nappropriate time to remind everyone\nof the law. Drinking on public\ntransport is illegal. Appearing naked\nin a public place is illegal. Drinking\nin a minibus is illegal.\n\u201cTo make it absolutely clear,\nAlex, Abi and I will suspend any\nClub or Team the moment that a\nconfirmed report is received. A\nthorough investigation will then\nbe carried out; and this could take\nweeks. Every missed fixture, booking\nor activity will be forfeited, with no\ncompensation.\n\u201cBUCS points, money, or \u2018tradition'\nbear no relation to the extent of\ndiscipline that can and will be\nadministered\u2026 Poor behaviour has\nnever been acceptable and will no\nlonger be tolerated.\n\u201cI am not exaggerating when I say\nthat if there is another event similar\nto those of the previous week, the\nfuture of student-led, independent\nactivity is at risk of cessation.\u201d\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nThe window was smashed from the inside, allegedly with an emergency hammer.

The\nexcited chatter describes their\nspeculations on what they\u2019ll see today\nand whilst the startling juxtaposition\nof businesspeople commuting to\nwork and young adults dressed in\ntinfoil armour momentarily takes me\naback, the cosplayers are oblivious to\nthe judgement of the general public;\nthis is their weekend and they arrive\nin blazing confidence, flooding\ninto the DLR on the last leg of their\nincoming journey.\nI strike up a conversation with a\nyoung, glamorous singer with deep\nblue hair on the train. Sagey, 21, a\nLondon-based make-up artist, talks to\nme about why people enjoy dressing\nup as their favourite characters so\nmuch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to become, if only just\nfor a weekend, someone you really\nadmire.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that the\ncharacter is fictional; good fiction\nis always believable and is expertly\ncrafted to arguably teach us so much\nmore succinctly than real life role\nmodels.\nIn fact, having a role model in\nthe first place is a sign of humility\nand self-acceptance that there is\nsomething or some goal you aspire to\nbe that you haven\u2019t achieved yet.\nSagey is dressed as a male singer\nfrom a long-named anime that I\nforget almost instantaneously. Her\nlong white jacket is elegantly adorned\nwith golden tassels and yellow rope,\nand the gold-and-black gloves and\ncollar complement the purple-blue\nhair in giving off a regal aura.\nI ask her what part of her costume\ntook him longest to prepare, and she\nreplies, \u201cThe costume was actually\nmade by a family friend \u2013 the makeup takes a while though; it takes\nmaybe three hours to get ready, and I\nusually come as a different character\nevery day.\u201d As well as layers of\nfoundation to change the colour of\nthe skin tone, the eyebrows are also\npurple and heavy eye shadow brings\nout Sagey\u2019s large, dark blue eyes\npeering out innocently underneath\nspecial contact lenses.\nThe feeling I got as I entered the\nmain hall of the ComicCon venue is\nbest described as one which would\ngive any conformist a heart attack.\nI was afraid that knowing nothing\nabout the convention would mean\ngetting physically and mentally lost,\nbut instead I was instantly trying to\nsuppress laughter at the incredible\nincredulity of it all.\nElsa from Disney\u2019s Frozen walks\npast me without a second glance with\na Batman and several Stormtroopers\nfollowing her. A female Loki and a\nmale pixie stop and have a chat with\nKatniss Everdeen in the magnificent\nwhite winged dress from Catching\nFire. A white knight with a staring\nsun emblazoned on his chest looks\ninquisitively at a black one with a\nboar sigil and one arm as he walks by.\nThis is, beyond a doubt, one of the\nmost amazing places I\u2019ve ever set foot\nin. I simply stand there and try and\ntake in the extraordinary atmosphere\na little more.\nAfter composing myself, I enter the\nnearest hall and find myself facing an\nuncountable number of busy stalls, all\nadvertising colourful merchandise.\nFood stalls sat in the corner selling\nWestern and Japanese style foods\nand other innovative treats, such as\nflavoured ice with fruit. There are\nbig trademarks and vaguely familiar\ninternet brands that draw the eye,\nsuch as a giant inflated Pikachu\nhanging off the ceiling, clearly above\nthe Pok\u00e9mon stall.\nVideo game brands such as Square\nEnix and Harvest Moon hang their\nrecognisable banners from the\nceiling, and I notice some stalls\nbelonging to apparent YouTube stars\nand other internet phenomena such\nas Cyanide & Happiness and Weebl\u2019s\nStuff. Famous hardware brands such\nas Nvidia and Samsung appear too, to\ndemonstrate their latest technology. I\ntake a peek into a theatre and there\u2019s\nan ongoing panel from RoosterTeeth\nwho have also gained online fame\n\"It's a\nchance to\nbecome,\nif only\njust for a\nweekend,\nsomeone\nyou really\nadmire.\"\nI was\ninstantly\ntrying to\nsuppress\nlaughter\nat the\nincredible\nincredulity\nof it all.\nKILL...

I\u2019m always suspicious of a\nfilm that describes itself with more\nthan two genres, but when you are a\nsupernatural thriller incorporating\nelements of fantasy, comedy and\nromance, with a bit of drama to boot,\nit\u2019s never going to go well.\nThe plot in itself is fairly simple.\nWhen the long term girlfriend\n(Juno Temple) of Ignatius Perrish\n(Daniel Radcliffe) is murdered, Ig is\naccused of her death. After drunkenly\nsmashing a few Virgin Mary statues,\nhe wakes up with horns growing on\nhis head, and people telling him all\ntheir dirty little secrets. When he\nrealises that people will do whatever\nhe tells them, he decides to use this\npower to try and figure out who really\nkilled his girlfriend.\nHorns is based on the book by Joe\nHill, and unfortunately it stumbles\ninto all the pitfalls of a bad book\nadaptation. It tries to be faithful to\nthe source material, but in doing\nso it stuffs in so much irrelevant\ndetail that you question the reason\nfor whole scenes being in the film.\nPart of the issue is the overload of\ngenres. It can be pretty jarring to\nhave a massive genre shift between\nscenes, especially as this seems to\nhappen with every scene change.\nPerhaps if it has stuck to one genre it\nwould have been fine. Horror would\nhave been a good choice, the inner\ndesires of people are some of the most\nunpleasant things about the film,\nwith sex addicts, paedophiles and\nthe line \u201cStop being my son\u201d already\nbeing in the film. Concentrating\nmore on those might have helped\nwith the issues, rather than comedy\nthat mostly falls flat and a secondary\nromantic subplot that I still haven\u2019t\nmanaged to figure out the point of.\nAs the film is set after the murder\nof Juno Temple\u2019s character, Merrin,\nunsurprisingly there are a lot of\nflashbacks. These have the dual\npurpose of showing just how in\nlove the two of them were and\nexplaining exactly what happened\nto Merrin. The romance is cute and\nconvincing. They met as children\nand have been together even since.\nA lot of the characters spend time\ntrying to convince the audience how\nin love they were too. The probably\nisn\u2019t a named character who doesn\u2019t\nmention it, in a \u201chow could you\nkill her\u201d sort of way. As the film\nprogresses, the flashbacks get more\nmessy, and it makes the film hard\nto understand at times, especially as\nthe content of the flashbacks changes\neach time Ig learns something more.\nThe flashbacks also attempt to reveal\nmost of the twists of the film, but\nmost are so obvious you see them\ncoming a mile off. Maybe two out of\n\u201cAre you feeling horny?\u201d\nEllen Mathieson on Radcliffe\u2019s latest venture, Horns\nDirector: Alexandre Aja\nScreenplay: Keith Bunin, Joe\nHill (novel)\nCast: Daniel Radcliffe, Juno\nTemple, Max Minghella, Joe\nAnderson\nmany twists are genuinely surprising.\nHorns marks yet another film\nof Daniel Radcliffes done in an\nattempt to distance himself from\nthe character of Harry Potter,\nand he seems to finally be getting\nsomewhere. His acting has only\nimproved since Deathly Hallows, and\nI was fully impressed by the range\nhe managed to show here. The main\nissue facing both him and co-star\nJuno Temple is that neither can pull\nof a convincing American accent.\nJuno Temple could barely keep it the\nsame between lines, slipping back\nto her usual voice with a worrying\nfrequency. Daniel Radcliffe was\nbetter, only losing it majorly a couple\nof times, but still haunted by the\nfact that you are only able to hear\nHarry Potter when he speaks with his\nBritish accent.\nTechnically the film looked lovely,\nbut when your characters spend\nhalf their time in a beautiful, mossy\nforest, it is pretty much impossible\nfor it to not look good. The opening\nshot of Ig on the floor, beginning\nupside down and twisting round as he\ngets up, was a clever idea, but didn\u2019t\nreally work in practice. The special\neffects budget was obviously all spent\non the big scenes later in the film,\nleaving any shots in the first half of\nthe film looking laughably bad.\nOverall unless you are fan of the\nsource material, or of this sort of film\nin general, or just really like forests,\nyou\u2019re not going to find much you\nlike. You can tell that it tries hard to\nmake everyone happy, but in the end\nthat just means that no-one is going\nto be satisfied.\nDaniel Radcliffe tries his best to look sexy\n\"The\nopening\nshot...was\na clever\nidea, but\nit didn't\nreally work\nin practise.\"\n\"After a\ndrunkenly\nsmashing a\nfew Virgin\nMary\nstatues, he\nwakes up\nwith horns\ngrowing on\nhis head\"\n\n"

Engineers\nWithout Borders UK is a charitable\norganisation that believes access to\nengineering and technical know-how\ncan help overcome many of these\nchallenges.\nOur work aims to demonstrate\nthe link between engineering and\nhumanity, a connection that is often\nneglected in our education and in\npractice.\nEWB Imperial, a branch of EWB\nUK, is a well-established society\nproviding opportunities for Imperial\nstudents, local school children and\nour international partners. We are\na gathering of environmentally and\nsocially conscious engineers and non-engineers, engaging in meaningful\nprojects which create Massive Small\nChange both locally and abroad.\nNow at Imperial, there are a\nplethora of different ways to\nget involved with International\nDevelopment (ID), with groups\nfocussing on fundraising and\nawareness such as UNICEF-Imperial\nand Imperial Hub, as well as others\npreparing and organising teams of\nvolunteers to go around the world to\nhelp out first-hand in critical areas,\nsuch as EWB-Imperial, Raincatcher,\nKenyan Orphan Project, e.quinox,\nand Water Brigades.\nThe challenges faced during ID\nprojects are quite different from any\nyou might experience on your course.\nOne must observe, interact and\nconsult with all the local stakeholders\nto gain a complete understanding of\nthe barriers to development.\nMany engineers are able to work\nthrough the technical aspects of\na project, however only a handful\nhave the range of skills necessary to\novercome linguistic, political and\npractical obstacles and create positive\nchange.\nThese skills are highly transferrable\nto a working environment, and have\nenabled previous EWB members as\nwell as those from other ID societies\nto make a bright start to their chosen\ncareers. Many employers hold\napplication processes which look for\npeople who will be responsible and\nhave indicated their commitment\nbeyond involvement in technical\nprojects.\nTo this end, EWB Imperial is\nrunning a programme of scenario-based workshops called \u201cLeadership\nfor Development\u201d (LfD) in\npartnership with Imperial Hub.\nRunning for the 3rd\nconsecutive year\nsince their inception, these sessions\nare given by experienced researchers\nand professional engineers, to help\nyou acquire the tools to finance, plan\nand deliver a successful overseas\nproject. Imperial Horizons also run\nthe EWB Challenge for 2nd\nyears,\ncovering similar themes to LfD, and\nculminating in a design submission to\nthe National competition.\nThe 3rd\nLfD talk of the season has\nnow taken place \u2013 \u201cCross-Cultural\nCommunication\u201d with Ruth Fuller, a\nvolunteer with EWB-UK.

Next week on 13th\nNovember,\nwe are welcoming Doug Harper,\nthe CEO of EWB-UK no less, to\nhost a debate on what Effective\nAid really is (for example: does\nsending your old shoes or clothes to\nMassive, Small Change\nShiladitya Ghosh & Marcus Bishop on opportunities with EWB\n\"We...\ncreate\nMassive\nSmall\nChange\nboth\nlocally\nand\nabroad.\"\nThis tip is also useful in life.

Left with\ngaping wounds on their landscape,\nthe city has been reborn in an\nextraordinary way in the last three\ndecades whilst embracing its cultural\nheritage.\nOn one hand you have the\ncenturies old Berliner Dom built in\nRenaissance style next to the river\nSpree, then there is the sprawling\nMemorial to the Murdered Jews, a\ntribute of over 19,000m3\nof concrete\nblocks commemorating the tragedy\nof WWII.\nHaving spent a month in Berlin, I\ncouldn\u2019t help but fall in love with this\nmetropolis complete with its multinational inhabitants. Despite my best\nefforts, I couldn\u2019t visit everything I\nwanted to, but here are some of my\ntop five most frequented hangouts:\nTempolhofer Park\nA former airfield that was still in\nuse until 2008, this endless stretch of\ncriss-crossing tarmac paths is now an\nunofficial park beloved by Berliners.\nWith over 300 hectares of ground,\nit is pretty safe to say that you won\u2019t\nhave to worry about not finding a free\nspot. With the fenced off terminal at\nthe side and numerous abandoned\nplanes scattered around, there\u2019s\nplenty for you to explore.\nThe best way to do so is to\nrollerblade or cycle; it\u2019s not every\nday you get to whiz down an airport\nrunway, or have a barbeque while you\nwatch people paraglide.\nThe park also hosts various pop-up\nevents; during my visit there was a\nmodern art mini golf installation,\nright next to a horticulture corner\nrun by a local University. High\nprofile events such as the Berlin\nMarathon and the Popkomm (during\nBerlin Music Week) were also held\nthere.\nThe only downside of this park is\nthat it\u2019s not easy to reach from; you\nhave to walk quite a distance with\nno signs to direct you. Therefore\nit\u2019s recommended that you studied\nyour route or print out a map in\npreparation for your visit.\nTempelhofer Field, 12099 Berlin\nStation: U6 Tempelhof or U7\nS\u00fcdstern\nFree entry\nBiergartens and Beach Bars\nIt would be a shame for you to visit\nBerlin and not indulge yourself in the\nfavourite drink of the nation.\nWhilst unfortunately biergarten\nis not a place where beers grow out\nof the ground and nor are beach bars\nactually next to the beach, they are\nfavourite hangout spots for locals\nwho flock there on sunny afternoons\nto chat and gulp down a few pints.\nI had accidently stumbled into a\nbiergarten on my first day in Berlin \u2013\nthe relaxing, friendly vibe had drawn\nme in like a moth to flame. Equipped\nwith an expanse of chairs scattered\nacross a courtyard, there will be a bar\nserving all kind of beers imaginable,\nfrom the local Berliner to a refreshing\nlemon beers .\nThere is usually a snack stand too,\nselling wrusts (German sausages) and\nchips. There is an endless parade of\nbiergartens throughout Berlin and\nsome even have their own brew for\nthe beer fanatic in you to try.\nDespite my inability to figure out\nwhy Berliners are so obsessed with\nsand, beach bars are admittedly a\nmarvellous idea.\nOften situated next to the river,\nor in some cases on a rooftop, you\nwill find rustic wooden benches and\ndeckchairs scattered across sandpits\nand raised platforms, not unlike\nthose you find in popular seaside\ndestinations. Some of the more\ndedicated bars even have a hot tub for\nits guests and in those next to a river\nor a lake many of the punters would\nventure in for a swim in the summer\nmonths.\nCassiopeia Biergarten\nAddress: Revalerstr. 99 10245\nBerlin\nStation: M13 Simplostra\u00dfe/ U\nWarschauer Str\nDeck5\nAddress: Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee 79,\n10439 Berlin\nStation: U2 Schonhauser Alle\nOpen: 10:00 \u2013 00:00\nMauerpark Fleamarket\nOne of the largest scale flea markets\nthat I have ever seen in my life, there\nis no doubt that this is my favourite\nplace on Earth, hands down.\nOpen every Sunday, this place is\ncompletely swamped with tourists\nand local alike, as well as a plethora of\nstreet artists performing next to the\nmarket.\nThe eastern entrance leads you\nstraight into the busiest, more\nprofessional part of the market selling\nhandmade jewellery, homemade\nhoney in variety of flavours, printed\nshirts and drawstring bags.\nThe best parts of the flea market\nare the ever changing second hand\nstores further in. It is a true treasure\nhunt as you browse from stall to stall,\nhaggling with stall owners for that\ngorgeous vintage skirt or stumbling\nupon a pair of retro roller skates that\nis just your size.\nFurther on are rows after rows of\nantique wares lined under tents, and\nstalls selling sunglasses or fridge\nmagnets with quirky quotes. Unless\nyou go into the market with nothing\non you, it is a true feat to emerge\nwithout spending any dosh in this\nplace.\nIt is very easy to feel claustrophobic\nand if you need to refuel or\nescape, there\u2019s plenty of food store\naround selling Nutella crepes and\nCurrywrusts and you head over to the\nempty green space next to the market\nto enjoy the music from Maurerpark\nbearpit karaoke, or up the hill to enjoy\nthe graffiti and swings.\nAddress: Bernauer Stra\u00dfe 63-64,\n13355 Mitte\nStation: M10 Wolliner Stra\u00dfe, U2\nEberswalder Stra\u00dfe or U8 Bernauer\nStra\u00dfe\nOpen: Sun 8:00 \u2013 18:00\nFree entry\nMarkhalleNeue Street Food\nThursday\nLocated in the hip district of\nKreuzberg, this hall transforms into\nTempolhofer Park on a sunny afternoon.

Why is it on my\nlist then, you might ask. Well the\nanswer is that I have been to this shop\nthree times, and every time I ended\nup spending hours in there scouring\nthrough the racks and scouring a\ngood buy.\nIf your not adverse to the idea of\nsecond hand clothing and harbour an\ninner hipster shopaholic inside you,\nthen this could be your salvation or\nyour downfall, depending on how you\nlook at it.\nFrom left to right: Enjoying a local Berliner beer with a book during the\nday, visit the romantic beach bar Deck 5 during sunset to make the most\nof the day.

Displayed\nchronologically over two floors, the\noutfits displayed were mostly worn in\nBritain.\nThe exhibition also includes the accessories worn by the brides. Some of\nthe higlights of the exhibiton include\nKate Moss\u2019 wedding dress, designed\nby John Galliano, the Duchess of\nCornwall\u2019s coat and headpiece worn\nat her marriage to HRH The Prince of\nWales, and the bright pink Dior dress\nworn by Gwen Stefani on her wedding\nday to Gavin Rossdale.\nThe opening section of the ex-hibiton features early examples of\nbridal fashion, notably a silk brocade\ngown and petticoat, worn with a silk\ncovered straw hat and silk satin shoes,\nworn by Jane Bailey for her marriage\nto James Wickham in 1780. In the 18th\ncentury, most royal and arisocratic\nbides wore silk gowns woven with\ngold and silver, whilst other brides at\nthe time wore fabrics patterned with\nflowers and other motifs, as these\ndesigns could be worn again after the\nwedding. Bridal hats were also a big\ntrend at the time, as the preserved\nmodesty.\nIt was only in the 19th century\nthat white dresses became more\nfashionable. In fact, a significant\nmoment in wedding dress history\ntook place when Queen Victoria wore\na white dress for her marriage to\nPrince Albert in 1840. This cemented\nthe white dress and the white veil as\nthe dominant tradition for weddings\nfor the next 200 years.\nThe beginning of the 20th century\nsaw a radical change in bridal\nfashion, which became influenced by\nhistorical costumes. By the 1920\u2019s,\nbridal fashion became heavily\ninfluenced by evening wear. Dresses\nwere no longer diaphanous and full,\ninstead, they were slim-hipped and\nmade from rich, beaded fabrics or\nsatins. Lace, pale gold, pale pinks and\nvelvet became common styles for\nwedding gowns in the roaring 20\u2019s.\nDuring the Second World War, the\n\u2018austerity look\u2019 arose. When clothing\nrestrictions and rationing were put\nin place, brides had to be practical\nwith the types of fabrics they used\nfor their wedding gowns. Some\nborrowed or hired dresses, whilst\nothers used non-rationed fabrics such\nas upholstery, net curtaining and\neven parachute silk. Alternatively,\nsome women chose to wear a smart\nday dress or service uniform.\nDuring this time, the British fashion\nindsutry had hoped that the war\nwould reduce Paris\u2019s dominance of\nthe international fashion market,\nbut Christian Dior\u2019s debut collection\nin 1947 only solidified Paris\u2019 place\nas the fashion capital of the world.\nAt the time, the British government\ncriticised the new Dior look for being\ntoo impractical and luxurious, with\nits long full skirts not in line with\nausterity measures. Despite these\ncriticisms, British women were still\nentranced by the designer\u2019s luxurious\nstyle.\nBy the 1960\u2019s, ready to wear\nclothing began to challenge the\ndominance of couture designers.\nInnovative styles were marketed to\nyoung clientele, and this married well\nwith the cultural and style revolution\nthat took place at the time.\nThe ground floor of the exhibition\nfeatures styles from 1775-1950, whilst\nthe mezzanine level features wedding\nstyles from the 1960\u2019s to 2014. The\nmezzanine collection includes some\nof the most up to date bridal designs\nby Jenny Peckham and Temperley\nBridal, as well as celebrity gowns.\nThe exhibiton is showing at\nthe V&A until March 15th 2015\n(Travel Partner Kuoni, supported\nby Waterford Crystal and Monsoon\nBridal.)\nJohn Galliano wedding gown, worn by Kate Moss\nPhoto: Victoria and Albert Museum\n\n"

There is something\ndeeply attractive about a story of\npassionate love between brother\nand sister, vengeful adulteresses and\ncorrupt cardinals which all end in a\nbloody birthday party.\nThis production, in particular, was\nan especially immersive experience\ndue to the wonderfully intimate space\nof the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.\nOpened in January, this smaller,\nindoor sister theatre of the Globe\ngives the characters extraordinary\nfreedom to embrace the audience into\nthe deliciously hypocritical, bloody\nand of course, incestuous world of\n17th century Italy.\nThe candlelit setting lends itself to\nthe clever play of light and shadow,\nwhile its small size allows characters\nto come up close and the audience\nbecomes part of the set \u2013 at one point,\nAnabella\u2019s dim suitor Bergetto falls\nover the railings and into an audience\nmember\u2019s lap. Intimate scenes are\nplayed with the candle lights lowered\nto cast gentle shadows on faces, which\nare then elevated in the more public\nscenes. The lights are extinguished\n\"There is\nsomething\ndeeply\nattractive\nabout a\nstory of\npassionate\nlove\nbetween\nbrother\nand sister.\"\nFiona Button as Annabella and Max Bennett as Giovanni in Michael Longhurst's production.\nPhoto: Simon Kane\n\"Excellent\nuse of the\nunique\nspace to\nhighlight\nthe play's\nunbridled\npassions.\"\none by one as Annabella\u2019s incestuous\npregnancy is revealed and the\nvengeful adulteress Hippolita\u2019s plot\ncomes together with the schemes\nof each suitor \u2013 culminating in the\nmistaken murder of Bergetto in\ncomplete darkness.\nWith three layers of performance\nspace, the story is presented with\nexciting visual variation, where\na visitor can walk in on a heated\ndiscussion happening on the main\nstage from a lower entrance while\nAnnabella and her housekeeper looks\non from the balcony above; and at\nthe same time other characters sing\na chorus on the sides and someone\nslams open the doors and walk on\nstage.\nIn my view, this production\u2019s\nachievement was to make excellent\nuse of the unique space to highlight\nthe play\u2019s unbridled passions.\nDespite that, the play refrains from\nmaking a judgment on the incest or\nthe corrupt society where it happens,\nsimply making it plain to the\naudience and allowing us to decide for\nourselves.\nThere is an interesting balance\nbetween simplicity and grandeur,\nwith the almost minimalist costumes\ncontrasted with the classical choir\ninterludes and live music. The\nabsence of ostentatious sets and\nshowy props brings out the fine acting\nof Fiona Button as the passionate,\nvivacious Annabella who simply\nfollows her heart, and Max Bennett as\nthe stubborn and arrogant Giovanni,\nwho insists on justifying his love with\nverses from the Bible.\nThere are also delightful comic\ninterludes from James Garnon as the\n\u201cdunce\u201d of a suitor, who transforms\ninto a corrupt cardinal later in the\nplay. Amid the materialistic, amoral\nsociety the characters live in, the\ntransgressive relationship between\nthe siblings holds a kind of warped\ninnocence, only to have everything\nspiral out of control as Giovanni is\ngripped by obsession and vengeance.\nBlood and death ends the play with\nthe cardinal remarking coolly that all\npossessions of the dead will be taken\naway by the church.\n\u2018Tis Pity is a fascinating theatrical\njourney that makes classical theatre\naccessible and enjoyable for the\nmodern audience and is definitely\nnot to be missed.\n\u2018Tis Pity is on at the Sam Wanamaker\nPlayhouse until 7th December\nA Twentieth Century Russian Tragedy\nI\u2019ll give you my cheek you\u2019ll want my\nbreast. I\u2019ll give you my breast you\u2019ll\nwant my badger. You\u2019ll work your\nway down and nothing will stop you\u2019.\nOpening on the 10th October,\ndirector Katie Mitchell returns to\nThe Young Vic in a production of\nRussian playwright Anton Chekhov\u2019s\nfinal play, The Cherry Orchard. Set in\n20th century Russia, the play follows\nan aristocratic Russian matriarch and\nher family in the midst of losing their\nbeloved country estate along with its\nimmense cherry orchard.\nInitially devised as a comedy, the\nplay\u2019s original director, Stanislavski,\nsaw it more as a tragedy and it is\nthis interpretation that influences\nMitchell\u2019s current portrayal. The\nset is cold and gloomy with the once\ngrandiose house now haggard and\npoorly illuminated.\nChekhov explores many themes in\nthe play: nature, modernity, personal\nidentity and the effect of social\nchange.\nSeveral works of the period\ncommented on the clash of old\nRussia and \u2018modern\u2019 Western\nvalues and so many deemed the\nplay to be Chekhov\u2019s commentary\non a society unwilling to adapt to a\nmodern Russia, primarily through\nhis depiction of Lady Ranevskaya\nand her downright refusal to save the\ncountry estate.\nThe play is stolen by Gawn\nGrainger in his portrayal of Firs, an\nelderly and frail serf who has worked\nfor the family for many years. Now\nbarely able to walk, his years of\ndevotion and dedication to the family\nmake the final tragedy of loneliness\nall the more painful.\nWhilst scattered with light\ncomedic moments, an overwhelming\ndarkness predominates. Stephens has\nconsiderably shortened the play, 2\nhours in all, which serves to avoid any\nmoments of dullness.\nThe play is ideal for both Chekhov\nvirgins and veterans alike and the\nhard-hitting conclusion is sure to\nlinger in your mind whatever your\nexperience.\nThe Cherry Orchard (Dir: Katie\nMitchell) is on at The Young Vic until\n29th November. Monday-Saturday,\n7.30pm, Matinees on Wednesday and\nSaturday.\nTickets are available online, priced from\n\u00a310-35\nDoing The Polka With Sigmar Polke\nWhat is a Sigmar Polke?

And Mr\nTurner is no exception when it comes\nto his expert craftsmanship. It is a\nhugely ambitious biopic, one that\ncovers decades of an eccentric artist\u2019s\nlife, packing the narrative full with\nrich, colourful settings, memorable\ncharacters, and a deep, poignant view\ninto the protagonist.\nThe title refers to J. M. W. Turner\n(Timothy Spall), an English Romantic\nlandscape painter, and Leigh chooses\nto focus the film on his later years.\nHe is an eccentric figure to say the\nleast, and quite the contradictory\none, too. His close relationship with\nhis father William, (Paul Jesson) who\nessentially acts as his assistant, is a\nfamily connection he cannot live\nwithout. This is put to the test when\nthe old father eventually falls ill and\npasses away. But when his mistress\nSarah Danby (Ruth Sheen) turns up\nwith their daughters, he refuses to\nacknowledge them, despite their best\nefforts to connect with their distant\nfather. Sheen is terrific and ferocious,\nand despite being in only two brief\nscenes, makes her mark with a\nstunning supporting performance.\nIn fact, a lot of Mike Leigh\u2019s regular\nMR TURNER\nDirector: Mike Leigh\nScreenplay: Mike Leigh\nCast: Timothy Spall, Dorothy\nAtkinson, Paul Jesson\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: christopherfowler\nLet\u2019s Move\nPhoto: huffingtonpost\nFED UP\nDirector: Stephanie Soechtig\nScreenplay: Mark Monroe,\nStephanie Soechtig\nCast: Katie Couric (narrator)\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nKatie Couric is Fed Up. In this\nnew documentary, which\nshe narrates and executively\nproduces, we see the health epidemic\nplaguing the lives of Americans. It\nspares no one, and a sharp increase\nin the number of children affected\nby this in particular is what is so\nshocking. Yes, it\u2019s the much talked-of issue of obesity. We\u2019re at a point\nwhere more people will die of eating\ntoo much than too little. Alarming\nstatistics of how many Americans will\nbe obese by year 2050 and how many\nchildren develop diabetes nowadays\ncompared to the previous near nonexistent number should be a wake-up\ncall to us all.\nBut that\u2019s not all. The reason for\nthis sudden rise in obesity is not\nsimply down to eating too much. As\nthe film comprehensively shows us,\nwhat we eat and the options that are\navailable seem to be the main culprits.\nThe food industry that viciously\ntargets their advertising of fattening\nfoods to very young children are\npartly to blame, and would you\nbelieve that corporate chains such as\nMcDonald\u2019s and Pizza Hut are able\nto operate their businesses in school\ncanteens as valid lunch options?\nWhen it comes to changing the\npolicies, certain powers that be are\nactively trying to stop young children\ngetting bypass surgeries in the name\nof profit. Money is where the power\nis, and policy cannot be implemented\nwithout the necessary votes, which\nare cast on popularity, and when\npopularity is driven by those with the\nmost cash, it becomes a problem.\nThe film makes a clever link\nbetween the power the food industry\nhas in the American government,\nand the power that the tobacco\nindustry used to possess. Nowadays\nthere are hardly any tobacco\nadverts on television for children\nto see. If a character in a film lights\nup a cigarette, this automatically\ntriggers a parental warning sign\nwith the Motion Picture Association\nof America to increase the age\nrestriction. Similar things have been\ntried with toning down vigorous\npromotion of unhealthy foods. But\nthen food industry experts rise up to\nprotest against this supposed nanny\nstate. Right wing Republicans (there\nis added footage of Sarah Palin for\nmore amusement) are the ones\nvehemently opposed to such changes,\nand it is doubtful whether any type of\nstatistics, educational documentaries,\nor any inkling of common sense, will\nmake a difference.\nFed Up makes me think of a quote\nfrom Cloud Atlas, of all films. \u201cJust\ntrying to understand why we keep\nmaking the same mistakes...over\nand over\u201d says Halle Berry. There\nare efforts being made to stop\nthis epidemic. Individuals such as\nJamie Oliver, Michelle Obama and\nmany others, despite the obvious\nrestrictions that are placed on them\nthanks to a sizable enemy who is\nimpossible to fend off, try their best\nto educate and reform. But it will be a\nlong, tough fight for sure.\nactresses are back to give it their all.\nMarion Bailey is simply delightful as\nTurner\u2019s landlady/later lover Sophia\nBooth in Margate, Lesley Manville\nproves she can do just about anything\nthat is pushed her away, playing the\nScottish scientist/mathematician\nMary Somerville, and a part of\nwhat makes the final moments so\ndevastating is down to Dorothy\nAtkinson\u2019s wonderful portrayal of\nTurner\u2019s forever-loyal housekeeper\nHannah Danby, who is suffering\nfrom psoriasis, a disease progression\nwhich is well captured throughout\nthe film. Turner does what he pleases\nwith Hannah, using her sexually\nwhenever he feels like it, and yet\nshe remains devoted to her master.\nWhat she receives in return is next to\nnothing, and she is constantly around\nin her silent existence, which makes\nher role all the more heartbreaking.\nEven the young Joshua McGuire\nhas his scene-stealing moment of\nthe year, hilariously taking over the\nrole of a pompous, over-privileged\nyoungster who fancies himself as a\nbit of a pretentious art critic, much\nto the dismay of Turner, the painter\nhimself.\nBut this truly is Spall\u2019s show\nthrough and through. In what\ncan only be described as a career-crowning performance, his Cannes\nBest Actor winning role should be\nscooping up a BAFTA for sure, and\nif lucky, an Oscar nomination, which\nwill be a first for the veteran actor\nwho has not yet had the exposure in\nthe States that his talent deserves. He\nreportedly practised painting and\nTurner\u2019s mannerisms for two years.\nAnd with this he creates something\ntranscendent. It really is that good.\nEvery grunting noise, crying face,\nsubtle movements of his eyes, his\nmumbling, grumbly voice, they\nall add up to Spall giving the most\nunforgettable performance you will\nsee this year.\nAside from his unusual personal\nlife, Turner\u2019s dedication to his\ncraft, and his endless need to paint\nwhatever fascinates him plays a huge\npart in the narrative. Interested in\nshipwrecks, fires and storms, there\nis a particularly memorable, jaw-dropping moment where Mr Turner\nties himself to a ship in the midst of\na storm. That he ends up with the flu\nafterwards comes as no surprise, but\nhe gets a magnificent painting out of\nit. And that, for him, is job well done.\nEven in a very poorly state, he insists\non heading out to get a quick sketch\ninto his book, despite objections from\nthe concerned Mrs Booth.\nOverseeing this all is Leigh\nhimself, who captures some brilliant\nportrait-like landscapes that you\nwill be gobsmacked to learn are,\nin fact, captured on film. The film\nflows flawlessly from year to year,\nnot having to give specific yearly\ntimestamps of any kind, but instead\nrelying on how the various characters\nhave aged and changed over the\ncourse of the film\u2019s running time.\nAnd yes, the 150-minute length may\nseem like a lot to take in, but when\nanchored by such a masterful lead, it\nwill be easy to be completely caught\nup in the colourful, eventful life of Mr\nJoseph Mallord William Turner.\nPhoto: bbc\n\n"

Some of them have a waist\nsize of just 19 inches; luckily the\nVictorians were lenient on expectant\nmothers \u2013 the maternity corset\ngiving the wearer a comfortable\n24 inches of breathing room. One\nlong-line Edwardian corset employs\na \u2018wide border of satin, embroidered\nbows, tapered boning in the back\ncasing, and four strong rubber\ngrip suspenders\u2019; it\u2019s described as\n\u2018lightweight\u2019.\nSurely things have changed for the\nbetter? Perhaps. Trends in women\u2019s\nfashion have certainly changed, but\nthis exhibition does little to convince\nthe viewer that it has played a key\nrole in feminist liberation. The\n\u2018flapper\u2019, whose typical dresses are\ndisplayed in the 1920s section, was by\nand large a male invention. No doubt\nactual, liberated flappers did exist \u2013\nLouise Brooks and Josephine Baker\nare two notable examples featured \u2013\nbut the trend was engineered largely\nby patriarchal society, which used the\n\u2018flapper\u2019 as another example of the\nflippancy of women.\nSimilarly, the icons of the golden\nage of Hollywood \u2013 Marlene Dietrich\nstaring down the camera like a\nmarble statue; Joan Crawford, with\nher mad popping eyes, piercing a\nhole through the lens \u2013 are held up as\nexamples of women with power, and\nyet the control exerted over them by\nthe major studios is never mentioned,\na curious omission for an exhibition\nthemed around the liberation of\nwomen.\nOther examples of men controlling\nhow women dress are present\nthroughout the exhibition, tainting\neverything: A Beatles fan-mag whose\nfront cover promises to teach you\n\u2018How To Make Him Like You\u2019; photos of\nSam Cam, that most insipid of public\nfigures, smiling dead-eyed in a M&S\nshift; and innumerable names of male\ndesigners.\nFrom Pierre Cardin to John\nGalliano, it is difficult to move for\nmale fashion designers. Even Karl\nLagerfeld, whose feminist credentials\nare beyond belief (moving on from\ncriticising Adele\u2019s weight, his most\nrecent show saw emaciated white\nwomen donning a horrific pastiche\nof the Suffragettes\u2019 legacy to shift\noverpriced clothing), gets a look in.\nEven those female designers\nfeatured don\u2019t come across that well;\nthe most heavily featured designer\nis \u2013 as you would expect \u2013 Vivienne\nWestwood, that grand dame of\nanarchy who continues to ensure that\nScotland\u2019s remaining tartan factories\nare kept in business.\nHowever, in the description the\nmuseum gives, Dame Westwood\nis said to have evolved from her\nsubversive origins as an engineer\nof punk into an internationally\nrecognised champion of British\ndesign and identity. This description\ndoes little justice to Westwood, who\ncontinues to be a subversive force of\nseismic proportions well into her 8th\ndecade.\nThat being said, there are some\nmoments of clarity and vision within\nthe exhibition: a highlight is the\nsection on the Suffragettes, whose\napproach to uniform could be seen\nas the first modern-day example of\nbrand awareness. Choosing white,\npurple, and green as their colours,\nthe members of the WSPU dressed in\nsmart formal wear, so that the public\ncould not dismiss them as riff-raff. As\nwas to be expected, public reaction to\nthese soldiers of suffrage was largely\nnegative, and the exhibit includes\na series of cartoons deriding the\nmovement.\nUnfortunately, the Design Museum\nseems to conflate \u2018Power\u2019 with\n\u2018Money\u2019; perhaps an easy mistake\nto make in our capitalist society,\nbut one that robs the show of any\npossibility of nuanced debate. We\nare told that Coco Chanel made\nVivienne Westwood, the Grand-Dame of controversial clothing, is one of the women\nfeatured. Photo: Christian Shambenait\nCan fashion be a force for liberation? Fred Fyles investigates\n\"It seems a\nbit gauche\nto feature\nthese\ndesigners\nat the\nexpense of\nless well\nknown\nwomen\ndesigners.\"\n\"Examples\nof men\ncontrolling\nhow women\ndress are\npresent\nthroughout\nthe\nexhibition,\ntainting\neverything.\"\nfree-form fashion popular, liberating\ninnumerable French women, but\nhow many Parisian charwomen could\nafford the prices? They exclaim that\nthe opening of Selfridges in 1909 was\na boon for women, since it provided\nan area where they could meet up\nand spend their leisure time, but as\nwe have seen from the recent BBC 4\nseries on shopgirls, such stores would\nonly be a liberated paradise to those\nwho weren\u2019t shackled to drudgery.\nThe First World War, during which\nwomen filled the vacuum in society\nleft behind by those at the front, is\nseen as a golden time for liberated\nwomen\u2019s fashion, but fails to\nrecognise that it was also a time when\nwomen were recognised as a great\nsource of untapped capital.\nAbove all, it is this lack of nuance\nthat is the downfall of the exhibition.\nTowards the back of the space, there\nare a selection of outfits, chosen\nby a consortium of 26 influential\nwomen, whose spheres range from\nmedia, to politics, to global finance.\nOn the surface this seems like a\npositive thing: a chance for powerful\nwomen, whose clothing choices are\nconstantly under scrutiny, to have\na conversation about what fashion\nmeans to them on their own terms.\nHowever, to the side of this exhibit\na series of pages detail interviews\nwith the women, which serve to\ntotally destroy any grand ideas\nthe exhibition may have had. In\nthe opening to the exhibit a photo\nof Angela Merkel is sandwiched\nbetween Thatcher and Obama, and\nthe description seems to lament that\nfact that so much attention is paid\nto the most powerful woman in the\nworld\u2019s clothing. In light of this the\ninterview questions seem weird: why\nshould we want to know how many\npairs of shoes Anna Hidalgo, mayor\nof Paris, has? Are we really interested\nwhether Camila Batmanghelidjh has\na personal shopper? I think not.\nWomen. Fashion. Power. Three\nbig themes, which could fill\ncountless textbooks and essays,\nare crammed into this small space,\nwhose horrifically confusing layout\n\u2013 designed somewhat embarrassingly\nby Zaha Hadid \u2013 does it no favours.\nIn order to fit in the last 150 years of\nwomen\u2019s history, the Design Museum\nhave had to remove any nuance they\nmay have had, swapping political and\nethical discourse for photos of Jane\nFonda, a decision that works against\nthe exhibition. Ultimately, the show\nfeatures a lot about women, and a lot\nabout fashion, but lacks a powerful\npunch.\nWomen Fashion Power runs at the\nDesign Museum until 26th\nApril 2015.\n\n"

Which is the\nlargest moon of the Solar\nSystem? Who is the only person to\nhave been awarded two unshared\nNobel Prizes?*\nFor many people, the answer to\nthose questions is \u201cwho cares?\u201d,\nor, if they\u2019re feeling charitable,\n\u201cjust google it\u201d. For a select few,\nhowever, being able to recall these\nnonessential bits of information\nrepresents a cherished pastime.\nThat\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about the\ntrivia enthusiasts.\nThese people pride themselves\nin knowing who the first Tory PM\nof Great Britain was, or the atomic\nnumber of Einsteinium, but their\nskill is generally hidden or left for\nthe odd pub quiz, and they are often\nunable to brag about how they know\nwho wrote \u201cAs I Lay Dying\u201d. Unless\nthey are college students, of course,\nin which case they will probably try\nto get on University Challenge.\nA true British institution, the\npopular quiz show has a little\nsomething for everyone, from those\nwho like to marvel at the vast range\nof knowledge to those who want to\nchallenge themselves to those who\njust want their dose of a sarcastic,\nquipping Paxman. Some are proud\nwhen they manage to answer at least\na question per episode, but some\ndream of getting on the big stage and\nproving themselves on national TV.\nImperial has produced a few teams\nof such hopefuls, and the college has\na reputation for being a juggernaut\nwhen it comes to scientific questions\nbut a minnow in artistic matters. In\n2011, for example, an unlucky cohort\nwas defeated in the first round by the\nUniversity of the Arts, and there\u2019s\na real feeling of overspecialisation\nwhen the Imperials are all reading\nphysics and biology and medicine\nand whatnot but the opposing team\ncan also boast experts in geography,\ntheology and literature. That\u2019s\nnot to say that the Imperials are\nalways hopeless in their quizzical\nendeavour: they have won the\ncompetition twice, in 1996 and 2001,\nand reached the final again in 2002,\nwhere they almost accomplished a\nspectacular comeback victory going\nfrom -10 to 185. In 2012 they made it\nall the way to the quarterfinals, being\ndefeated by the eventual winners,\nand in 2010 an excellent team was\njust short of the final.\nIt\u2019s been a while, however, since\nan Imperial team has made it to the\ntelevised portion of the show; the last\nteam, in 2012, left the competition\nwith the infamous \u201cInspector\nClouseau\u201d moment, and for two\nyears running no representatives of\nthe College have had the pleasure of\nbeing grilled by Paxman.\nIt is a great experience to go\nthrough the whole process and sit\non those uncomfortable chairs,\nfinger quivering on the buzzer, sweat\npearling on the forehead, hoping\nthat the next question is on the\nmaximum mass of white dwarf stars\nand not on the architect who rebuilt\nWestminster Palace. It\u2019s a thrill that\nis every bit as good as an athletic\ncompetition, only with obscure facts\nabout flags instead of footballs and\nrunning.\nThe only thing that is missing is a\nlittle bit of local team pride, and we\nhope to see soon an Imperial quartet\nteaching those Oxbridge brats a\nlesson.\nThe tryouts for this year\u2019s\ncandidates are going to be soon. If\nyou think you can wrestle with the\ndate of birth of Churchill and the\nlongest river of Australia, give it a\ngo. You may be next Imperialite to\nhave the honour of being berated by\nPaxman on TV.\n* In case you were wondering,\nthe answers are, in order: Nairobi,\nGanymede, Linus Pauling, the Earl\nof Bute, 99, William Faulkner, the\nChandrasekhar limit, Charles Barry,\n1874 and the Murray river.\nSpot the Felix cat chilling with the team from 2009. Fun fact, Amit was so amazing he made it into the national press AND he used to write for Felix Photo credit: Felix\n\n"

It\u2019s a word that\u2019s thrown\naround a lot these days. Defined\nas \u2018a person or thing regarded as a\nrepresentative symbol, or as worthy\nof veneration\u2019, it has today come to\nbe used as a catch-all term for anyone\nwho is elevated even slightly above\nthe general public. If there\u2019s one\nperson who truly deserves the title\nicon in this world, it\u2019s got to be Debbie\nHarry, the brilliant, bold, beautiful\nfront woman of new wave/punk band\nBlondie, who form the central subject\nof Somerset House\u2019s new exhibition:\nChris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and\nThe Advent of Punk, a selection of\nphotos by Blondie\u2019s guitarist Chris\nStein which, although small, has a\nlasting and powerful effect.\nTaking the photos as mere objects,\nthe skill of Stein is immediately\napparent; having trained at the\nSchool of Visual Arts in the mid-60s,\nhe did have some formal education\nin the discipline. However, Stein\napproaches photography in much the\nsame way he addresses his music: with\na punk, DIY attitude. \u2018Photography\nwas distant and mysterious\u2019, says\nStein, \u2018[it] was simply \u201cthere\u201d,\nbut undefined\u2019. Within the\ncomposition of the photos, his\nunique photographic eye is evident;\nDebbie Harry herself said that \u2018the\nsingularity of Chris\u2019 eye view of the\nworld comes through in every shot\u2019.\nAs the subject of many of the\nphotos present, Debbie Harry shines;\nnot satisfied with one public persona,\nHarry shape-shifts throughout the\nexhibition, her cut glass cheekbones\nthe only thing remaining constant.\nIn one delightful photo from 1976\nshe is walking down 14th Street, in\nNYC\u2019s East Village; clad in head to toe\nblack, with her platinum hair shining\nlike a halo around her head, she cuts\na striking figure, and everyone in\nthe photo turns to look as she walks\npast. In another, taken in 1978 while\nat the video shoot for \u2018Picture This\u2019,\nshe is illuminated from behind by a\nstarburst of studio lighting. Clutching\na microphone in her hand, she stands\non a neon walkway, looking like an\nalien beamed down from another\nworld, here to save us from the\nhorrors of mediocrity.\nDebbie Harry\u2019s subversive nature\nis also apparent, honed through\nyears of making music in a heavily\nmale-dominated environment. In one\namazing shot, Harry is reclining in\nthe plush black leather seat of a train,\nclutching a copy of The Sun, whose\nheadline, commenting on the social\nsituation in Iran, screams \u2018WOMEN\nARE JUST SLAVES\u2019. Above the edge\nof the paper, Harry stares directly\ninto the camera, a slight smile\nplaying around her eyes, as if she is\naware of the gross hypocrisy of the\nmainstream media.\nThese photos not only show the\nversatility of Harry\u2019s public image,\nbut serve as a history lesson of the\n1970s punk-rock scene, at that time\ncentred around down-and-dirty NYC:\nhere she is grinning with a dapper,\nbequiffed Bowie; here\u2019s Andy Warhol\nadjusting her hair before a photo\nshoot; here\u2019s Jean-Michel Basquiat\nserving as an extra for Blondie\u2019s\n\u2018Rapture\u2019 video, spinning records\non a set of decks. From Joan Jett to\nDavid Byrne, Iggy Pop to William\nS. Burroughs, it seems Blondie\ndeliberately sought out the company\nof fellow icons.\nUltimately, this exhibition \u2013\nalthough slight \u2013 is well worth\nvisiting, especially for anyone with\nan interest in the music scene of\n1970\u2019s New York, which the photos\nhelp consolidate into a near-tangible\npresence. As Stein himself says:\n\u2018they ground the moment in some\nsemblance of solidity\u2019; they bring the\natmosphere of the era into the room,\nand beam Debbie Harry directly into\ntoday\u2019s world. A bit more present, but\nevery bit as iconic.\nChris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie,\nand The Advent of Punk runs until 25th\nJanuary, 10:00-18:00. Free Admission\nSkate at Somerset House, the ice-rink,\nwill run from 11th\nNovember until 11th\nJanuary.

Manchester\nstudents have been very affected by\nAlan Henning\u2019s execution.\u201d\nOfficials from the University\nof Manchester\u2019s Student Union\nhave unanimously condemned\nthe tabloid\u2019s actions, with general\nsecretary Charlotte Cook issuing\nthe statement: \u201cWe have a zero-tolerance approach towards offensive\noutfits at the Union to ensure we are\nmaintaining a safe space for all our\nmembers.\n\u201cHowever, undoubtedly somewhere\nacross the country people will choose\nto wear inappropriate costumes. For\nThe Sun to purposefully have students\nout witch-hunting for this minority\nin order to completely misrepresent\nstudents as a whole is disgraceful.\u201d\nAlso speaking to The Guardian,\nBen Butcher from bathimpact said\nthat \u201cwe were told that pictures of\n\u2018Jihadi Johns\u2019 would be a front-page\nstory, but ebola victims would also\nbe good. They said a substantial\nfinancial reward would be offered.\nThey wanted to portray all students\nCarol Ann Cheah on the paper offering money for bad taste costume photos\nas stupid \u2013 based on the actions of a\nfew. We wouldn\u2019t want to sell out the\nwhole student body like that.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that The\nSun has courted student Halloween\ncostume controversy. Last year, the\ntabloid had published photos of\ntwo students from the University\nof Chester, who won a nightclub\nfancy dress competition with outfits\ndepicting the World Trade Center\u2019s\nTwin Towers being destroyed in the\n9/11 terror attacks.\nA spokesperson for News\nInternational issued the following\nstatement: \u201cThe Sun was aware that\nthere were Halloween parties taking\nplace on student campuses, with\nreports of some interesting choices\nof costumes, and was calling student\nnewspapers to see if they had photos\nthat they might want to share with\nthe newspaper. We categorically\ndeny any suggestion that money\nwas offered to construct or fake a\nphotograph.\n\u201cApproaching other publications\nis a legitimate and often practiced\njournalism request which we stand\nby.\u201d\nAn \u201cinvestigation\u201d into the use\nof human tissues at Imperial\nby The Mail on Sunday has\nbeen condemned by the College and\nthe Royal British Legion Centre.\nThe investigation, outlined in an\narticle posted by The Mail on Sunday,\ndetailed how \u201cHuman remains are\nbeing used in secretive weapons tests\nfunded by the sale of Remembrance\nSunday poppies,\u201d at the Royal\nBritish Legion Centre for Blast\nInjury Studies (CBIS), located on the\nSouth Kensington campus.\nThe article went on to describe how\n\u201clegs, feet, and possibly other body\nparts,\u201d are being imported from\nAmerica, and then \u201cdestroyed in\ngruesome experiments.\u201d The article\nMail on Sunday \u201cinvestigation\u201d on human tissue use at\nImperial \u201chighly misleading\u201d\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\ndescribed how limbs are regularly\ntransported to the test centre, but\nhighlighted that the College were\nnot answering The Mail on Sunday\u2019s\nquestions as to whether or not the\nlimbs are donated specifically for\nmilitary tests.\nThe college released a press\nstatement this morning, hitting back\nat the article. The College said that,\n\u201cAll human tissue used in the course\nof research at the Centre \u2013 whether\nfrom the UK or overseas \u2013 has been\ndonated to medical science, with\nfull informed consent, by either the\ndonor or their relatives.\u201d\nCollege also addressed the\naccusations made by the article\nabout refusing to answer questions,\nsaying that \u201cThe College has not\nrefused to name tissue suppliers.\n\u201cAs the journalist has known since\nWednesday 29 October, his inquiry\nis being handled as a Freedom of\nInformation request.\u201d\nThe Royal British Legion, a\npartner with Imperial College, also\nannounced that it \u201c[Deplored] The\nMail on Sunday\u2019s cynical attempt\nto discredit our funding of vital\nscientific research.\u201d The RBL went\non to say that \u201cFor The Mail on\nSunday to term this as a \u201cmacabre\ntrade in human legs and feet\u201d\nis sensational, false, and deeply\noffensive.\u201d\nThe Royal British Legion for Blast\nInjury Studies opened last October.\nHis Royal Highness Prince Harry\nofficially opened the research centre,\nthat looks to reduce the effects of\nroadside bombs and Improvised\nExplosive Devices (IEDs).\nThe centre is funded partly by\nthe Royal British Legion, a charity\nthat provides welfare for the Armed\nForces.

    "content": "34 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n07.11.2014\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAnother example of the Kusama/LV collaboration. What does it say about the nature of art\nand commerce? Photo: Louis Vuitton\n\"Not all\nsuch ideas\nare bad;\nsome\nhelp raise\nmoney for\ncharity\" The 1965 \"Piet Mondrian\" collection, from French designer Yves Saint\nLaurent Photo: Creative Commons\nthings still leave me feeling angry.\nIt\u2019s a gut reaction, something that\nhappens when I see such blatant\ncheapening of what I love.\nI feel like everyone should be\nable to have access to art, but not\nthrough a beer bottle. It is especially\njarring when such schemes do little\nto help anyone bar the artist and the\nindustry. I\u2019m not suggesting that\nEmin gives up her entire income;\nafter all, her dedication to the cult of\nmammon is well documented: as well\nas very public declarations in favour\nof the Conservatives and against high\ntax rates, Emin owns properties in\nLondon, St Tropez, Miami, and NYC.\nSuch behaviour should therefore not\nbe surprising.\nNot all collaborations are bad.\nSome, though far from all, help\nto raise money for philanthropic\ncauses. An example would be the\nrelationship between the Keith\nHaring Foundation and Tommy\nHilfiger, who in 2010 designed a\nseries of trainers featuring prints\nby the late American artist. The\nproceeds went to the Foundation,\nwhich provides grants for children\nin need and those affected by HIV/\nAIDS, the disease that eventually\nwent on to kill Haring in 1990. In\nessence, such projects are no different\nto those in other disciplines, such\nas the Red Hot CDs, which also raise\nmoney for HIV/AIDS, and whose\nlatest release draws on the work of\nAmerican musician Arthur Russell.\nBoth help to promote charity, and\nperhaps expose more people to works\nof art they would otherwise never see.\nHowever, one of the main problems\nthat I have with the issue is the way it\ncontributes to the commercification\nof fine art. Walter Benjamin, writing\nin A Small History of Photography,\ntalks about the \u2018aura\u2019 of art, a term\nthat refers to its fetishization within\nculture. A work of art exists only\nin one place, and can only be seen\nin that place at any one time \u2013\nthis uniqueness within space and\ntime means that the work of art is\nnot accessible to the masses, and\ntherefore becomes desirable.\nYou may argue that the relationship\nbetween art and industry helps\nbreak down this aura. After all,\nby releasing a range of designer\nhandbags, Kusama ensures that her\nwork is not only present in galleries,\nbut also out on the streets! This view,\nalthough optimistic, is also naive,\nignoring the economic aspect of such\ncollaborations. The vast majority of\nworks produced in these processes are\nextortionately expensive, following\nthe idea of \u2018purchase equals pleasure\u2019\nfundamental to a capitalist economy.\nRather than a democratisation of art,\ninstead what happens is culture, by\nand large, remains accessible only to\na select few, a plutocracy, operating in\nthe upper echelons of commerce.\nSo why do I feel this way about\nartists, and not other disciplines?\nWhy is it that the idea of Jeremy\nDeller, last year chosen to represent\nthe UK at the Venice Biennale,\ndesigning the interior of a Louis\nVuitton store in 2009 makes me roll\nmy eyes, but architects get a free pass\ndesigning the exterior? Perhaps it is\nbecause such a relationship seems\ninevitable. Fashion houses have\nalways needed stores; physical spaces\nin which, if their goods are not sold,\nthey can at least be admired by those\nwho can\u2019t afford them (think of the\nsheer amount of glass plating used by\nthe fashion industry).\nIf someone has to design these\nbuildings, it might as well be a good\narchitect. Zaha Hadid\u2019s Chanel\nPavillion, designed in 2008 and\nresembling a low flying cloud, is just\nas beautiful as her other buildings;\nHerzog and de Meuron's 2003\nPrada store in Tokyo is undeniably\na beautiful building, with its criss\ncross patterning and bulging glass\nfacade. The building as a structure can\nbe honest, even if what is contained\ninside is not.\nSimilarly, photographers seem to\npose less of a problem for me. When\nCindy Sherman collaborated with\nComme des Garcons in 1995 it didn\u2019t\nseem like a big transgression, but\nrather a natural extension of her\nwork. Similarly, Juergen Teller\u2019s 16\nyear collaboration with Marc Jacobs\ncan be seen as a source of art, even if\nhis bright, high-flash style has since\nbeen tainted by Terry Richardson,\nthe high priest of sleaze.\nThe crux of the issue for me\ncomes down to inevitability: the\nrelationship between architects or\nphotographers and fashion houses\nseems like a direct consequence of\ntheir structure. The house creates\ngarments, images of which need to be\ncirculated around society, whether\nthat is through print or digital\nmedia; similarly, a space is needed\nin which to present the objects,\nand the building itself is a neutral\nconstruction. But there\u2019s no necessity\nfor artists to do this. The artists who\ndo so would still be able to pay the\nbills if they refused \u2013 it is not a case\nof do or die. Through expanding\ntheir bank balance they destroy the\nbeauty and importance of art; a Yayoi\nKusama print becomes something to\nstitch into clothes; a George Condo\ncanvas mutates from a terrifying,\nneo-surrealist nightmare into decor\nfor a Birkin bag. Art becomes just\nanother commodity, to be consumed,\ndigested, and ultimately thrown\naway.\n\"Everyone\nshould\nhave access\nto art,\nbut not\nthrough a\nbeer bottle\"\n\n"

Over the next 14 years\nhe would revolutionise the fashion\nphotography industry, dragging it\nblinking into the bright world of\nmodernism.\nThe series of photos chosen in\nthe exhibition are pretty evenly\nsplit between portraits of famous\npersonalities and glossy fashion\nspreads for the magazines.\nHis approach to composition\nhas helped form our idea of the\n1920s, with his photos seeming to\nperfectly encapsulate the bright\nyoung spark that drove the motor of\nthis roaring decade. With the most\nmodern fashions captured against\nsupremacist-inspired backdrops,\nthe models seem to be archetypes\nof \u2018liberated women\u2019 \u2013 from flapper\ngirls to grand dames, artists to\ndancers, Steichen imbues each with\ntheir own individual quality.\nSteichen\u2019s mastery of artificial\nlighting means that each and every\nphotograph, although taken in black\n& white, seems to have its own inner\nwarmth that radiates out.\nHis series of actor\u2019s photographs\nare equally as impressive; having\nspent his formative years in New\nYork photographing some of the\nmost famous artists of the time, it\nseems Steichen had long since lost\nany trepidation that may accompany\nphotographing \u2013 that most intimate\nof actions \u2013 innumerable stars.\nThese portraits of actors are early\nprecursors of the modern cult of\ncelebrity.\nWe have Joan Crawford, wrapped\nin a black dress that drapes off her\nbody, haughtily looking down on the\nworld like an icy statue, her famously\nexpressive eyes downcast. Elsewhere\nMarlene Dietrich, that most alien\nof icons, is bathed in a soft glow; her\neyes turned up towards us, almost as\nif in pain, and her hand outstretched,\nlike an opium-eater on the verge of a\ncome-down.\nThere is a great deal of contrast\nat play in Steichen\u2019s work, not only\nbetween black and white, but also\nbetween the clothing and their\nenvironments. Particularly in his\nearly work the women are weighed\ndown with repressive clothing,\ncompletely at odds with the modern,\nalmost Bauhaus-esque backdrops.\nIt seems that even with complete\ncontrol over the camera and the\nscene, the things Steichen could not\ncontrol were the clothes themselves.\nSome portraits, however, are\nstartling in their modernism,\nparticularly his iconic portrait of\nGreta Garbo: dressed all in black, her\narms move up to push her hair back,\nrevealing her clear-cut cheekbones\nand almost pallid skin. Her body \u2013\nensconced in a turtleneck \u2013 seems\nto dissolve into the bottom of the\nphotograph, while the two planes of\nlight play against her skin, pulled\ntaut against her skull. She no longer\nresembles an actor; she is an icon\nof modernity and death, a vision of\nBergman\u2019s Nordic blues.\nMoving downstairs, we find a\nphotographer whose work is the\ncomplete opposite of Steichen\u2019s:\nViviane Sassen, a Dutch\nphotographer who has forged\nstrong links with i-D, AnOther, and\nDazed and Confused magazines. The\ndifference could not be more striking:\nwhile Steichen\u2019s work is firmly\nrooted in depression-era Hollywood\nglamour, Sassen\u2019s is unquestionably\ncontemporary; while Steichen relied\non traditional techniques of black\n& white silver-gelatin plates, Sassen\nis happy to mess around with new\nperspectives, digital techniques,\nand photoshop; and while Steichen\nharnesses complete control over\nthe multitude of greys that exist\nbetween both ends of the spectrum,\nSassen\u2019s eye-popping works are\nhypersaturated in vibrant, exuberant\ncolour.\nWhat sets Sassen apart from her\npeers is her meticulous eye for detail,\nand a bold willingness to shift the\nfocus away from clothes, instead\nfollowing her own singular vision.\nSome photographs have elements of\nsurrealism, where dresses resemble\n\"He would\nrevolutionise\nthe fashion\nphotography\nindustry,\ndragging\nit blinking\ninto the\nbright\nworld of\nmodernism.\"\ntriffid-like blooms as opposed to\nclothing; others see Sassen marrying\nsartorial realness with a sense of body\nhorror, like the twisted offspring of\nDavid Cronenberg and Guy Bourdin.\nHer irreverent and humourful\nattitude to fashion is clear: \u2018for me,\nfashion is one big playground, a place\nto experiment\u2019.\nUnfortunately, her work is not\ngiven the opportunity to shine that\nit so sorely deserves. Taking on a\nmore conceptual form than the\nSteichen collection, Analemma is\nexhibited as a 45 minute film, in\nwhich 350 pictures are run on a\nloop while a minimal soundtrack\nplays in the background. While\npresenting content in such a way\nis certainly novel, and allows us to\nreally get an idea of the key themes\nin Sassen\u2019s work, it doesn\u2019t allow us\nto experience its full breadth. It also\nmeans that we are not allowed to\nspend long lingering over a picture\nwe particularly love, or skip those one\nfinds boring; they all move past us at\nthe same meandering speed.\nThe Photographer\u2019s Gallery does\nvery well to pull off these two shows,\nhighlighting a discipline that is\nmuch maligned in mainstream\nartistic culture. By showing us two\nends of fashion photography\u2019s\ntimeline, the viewer is able to chart\nthe development of the form, from\na medium focussed purely on selling\noverpriced clothes to one that\ncelebrates the artist\u2019s vision and skill,\nwhile still trying to sell overpriced\nclothes. I guess some things never\nchange.\nEdward Steichen: The Conde Nast Years,\nand Vivenne Sassen: Analemma are on\nuntil 18th\nJanuary 2015\nEdward Steichen Actress Gloria Swanson, 1924.

They make\ngraphics tablets and drawing tools\nand marker pens; movies and comics\nand posters; action figures, trading\ncards, plush toys, manga; leather\nfantasy boots and weapons, swords\nand throwing knives, and shorts\nand hats - I even witnessed a tail\nshop (called TellTails), supplying\ndetachable tails for roleplaying your\nfavourite animal. And it goes without\nsaying that the immense creativity\nthat goes into crafting, designing,\nand building your own costume\nunderpins the entire event.\nThis struck me as immensely\nprofound in the context of this\ncommunity. That such events totally\nrely on resourceful and innovative\nartists speaks volumes about the\npeople within this cultural subset\n\u2013 a non-judgemental, universally\naccepting attitude which doesn\u2019t\ngive a shit about what you look like,\nhow old you are, where you\u2019re from,\nwhat your costume\u2019s like, or any\ndiscriminatory reason you can think\nof. There are teens and young adults\ndressed as the same characters as\nparents with their children of five\nyears old. Female Captain Americas\nand male fairies pass by every two\nminutes. Total strangers stop each\nother in the corridor and compliment\neach other on their costumes. And\nSagey\u2019s costume was so convincing\nthat I only found out that she was a\ngirl during a post-interview chat.\nAfter all, what can you pass\njudgement against, when every\nindividual is so strikingly different?\nWould I be singled out because\nI didn\u2019t come as a character?\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Liam, a seventeen\nyear old student studying in London,\ntells me. \u201cIt\u2019s 11am and I\u2019ve already\nspend \u00a3170 on action figures.\nComicCon isn\u2019t about just about\ncosplayers; it\u2019s about anyone with an\ninterest in this side of the creative\nindustry. We\u2019re here to appreciate\nall the work that these artists, big\nor small, have put in into creating\nsomething they\u2019re really passionate\nabout.\u201d\nAnd it turns out that people\nappreciate these events very much\n\u2013 the bigger the better. The London\nevents now attract over 100,000\nvisitors, only around 30,000 fewer\ncompared to the world\u2019s biggest event\nof its kind in San Diego. There are\nvisitors from all over London, the\nUK, and even Europe \u2013 a German\nDaenerys Targaryen and Shae from\nHBO\u2019s Game of Thrones were very\nhappy for me to take their picture.\nA different Daenerys, with an\nelaborate black dragon hovering over\nher, is accompanied by Melisandre\nand Queen Cersei, with Jon Snow\nhanging around the side. \u201cWe usually\ngo to the Manchester events as they\u2019re\ncloser to home,\u201d Cersei tells me.\n\u201cThere are events all over the country,\nbut the London ones in May and\nOctober are definitely the biggest; it\u2019s\nnot just the MCM Expo \u2013 there are\nother conventions too.\u201d\nWhen asked how long they spent\non their costumes, they replied with,\n\u201cAbout a few months, spending a\nlittle time maybe two days a week.\u201d\nI begin to think that not all people\nmake costumes for the character\u2019s\nsake \u2013 they could be inspired by the\ncostume designer themself when\ndeciding what their next big project is.\nI leave as Melisandre gets her picture\ntaken with a female White Walker\nwho simply walks up and joins the\ngroup. About fifteen girls in matching\ncat costumes walk by and spoil the\nfirst take.\nAnd so every once in a while a\nhidden community emerges from the\ngeneral public: perhaps consisting of\nthose not receiving a second glance\non the street, or those too shy to voice\ntheir opinions; to celebrate a place\nwhere anybody can put hard work in\nand gain recognition for their creative\nwork, regardless of the genetic lottery\nor any other prejudices of the English\nsociety that still exist in the 21st\ncentury.\nPerhaps some have dreamed of a\nutopia hidden within today\u2019s societal\nconfines, but the answer may be\nsurprising: what kind of convention\nconjoins a society of open-minded,\nnon-judgemental strangers?\nWhat\nkind of\nconvention\nconjoins\na society\nof open-minded,\nnon-judgemental\nstrangers?\nTotal\nstrangers\nstop each\nother in the\ncorridor\nand\ncompliment\neach other\non their\ncostumes.\nA rouge Deadpool picks out some new footware Photo credit: P.

Photo: DrugScope\nLauren Ratcliffe reports on the highs and lows of designer drugs\n\"[mephe-drone]\nchanged\nthe\ndesigner\ndrug game\nforever.\"\n\"What\nhappens\nnext will\nbe purely\na case of\ntrial and\nerror.\"\nThe UK Misuse of Drugs Act\nintroduced in 1971 is widely\nregarded as the most epically\nfailed governmental campaigns\nto prevent drug distribution and\nusage. By introducing complete\nprohibition it effectively promoted\nan underground black-market in\ndrug trade, condemned addicts to\nconviction rather than treatment,\nand prevented any form of research\non the drug\u2019s potential medical\nbenefits. Cameron even said himself\n(and I kid you not): \u201cPoliticians\nattempt to appeal to the lowest\ncommon denominator by posturing\nwith tough policies and calling for\ncrackdown after crackdown. Drugs\npolicy has been failing for decades\u201d.\nIt\u2019s interesting how this opinion\nchanged once he became leader of the\nconservative party\u2026\nNow, I\u2019m not here as a typical\nuniversity student in protest to \u2018free\nthe weed\u2019 just so I can smoke-up in\nmy room with a clean conscience.\nInstead, I want to talk about the\neffects this policy has had on the\nemergence and increased prevalence\nof legal highs.\nLegal highs, designer drugs, new\npsychoactive substances (NPS)\u2026\nwhatever you like to call them, they\nare all substances created for the sole\npurpose of mimicking illegal drugs.\nSold in \u2018head shops\u2019, they get around\nUK law by claiming not to be for\nhuman consumption and once they\nhave been bought it\u2019s the customer\u2019s\nresponsibility. Untested and\ndangerous, these new psychoactives\nhave been linked to 40 deaths in the\nlast year and present a growing global\nhealth concern.\nNPS can be sub-divided into three\ntypes depending on their similarity\nwith other illegal drugs; synthetic\ncannabinoids that, despite what you\nmay expect, actually bear no relation\nto the cannabis plant and are instead\nchemicals blended or soaked into\nplant matter that act in a similar way\nto cannabis on the brain; stimulant-type drugs with effects similar to\namphetamines and MDMA; and\nfinally, hallucinogenic compounds.\nWhen mephedrone (\u2018meow meow\u2019)\njumped onto the scene in 2008, it\nchanged the designer drug game\nforever. During a time when MDMA\nwas scarce and the quality of cocaine\nwas failing, mephedrone filled the\ngap in the stimulant market. For\nthe first time, a drug was being used\nglobally, heavily publicised and stuck\naround for 12-18 months before\nbeing controlled. Five years later,\nit seems like appeal of this drug to\nclubbers has lost its spark, perhaps\ndue the unpleasant paranoid sweat-inducing side effects. But the story\ndoesn\u2019t end here. The problem is, as\nsoon as one drug is banned, another\none with similar effects is produced\nwhich is legal, leading to a cat and\nmouse chase between governments\nand ambitious drug makers. The\nEuropean Monitoring Centre for\nDrugs and Drug Affiction (EMCDDA)\nhave explicitly acknowledged that\nmisuse legislation is insufficient to\ndeal with this designer drug problem,\nbut what then should be done? There\nare a few legislative options in place\naround the world; In the UK we have\na generic model where a compound\nis banned along with any chemically\nsimilar compound; in the USA\nthey have an analogue approach\nwhere a compound is banned along\nwith any other compound that\nhas similar effects irrespective\nof its pharmacology; Ireland and\nPoland have an outright blanket\nban where all head shops are closed;\nNew Zealand, however, take a more\ninteresting approach for non-medical\ndrugs whereby the manufacture\nis expected to demonstrate that a\nproduct proses minimal risk before it\ncan be sold. Clearly, these Heisenberg\nwannabes are not going to go away and\ncurrent legislation is not up to scratch;\nwhat happens next will be purely a\ncase of trial and error.\nWhat do you think should be done?\nShare your view: felixonline.co.uk/\nscience\nDiscovering the Beauty behind the Mundane\nI\u2019ve often found it difficult to find\na thoroughly engaging popular\nscience book.\nI tend to find them either far too\nelementary or with a writing style\ntoo stilted and formal to be a truly\nengaging read. Those that can be\neasily enjoyed while still remaining\ninformative tend to be few and far\nbetween.\nOne book that manages this\nseemingly impossible task is Mark\nMiodownik\u2019s book Stuff Matters,\nwhich explores the fundamental\nprinciples behind the properties of\nvarious materials that we see and use\nin our everyday lives. Miodownik\ntakes the subject matter at hand\nand presents it in such an engaging\nmanner as to keep any reader glued to\nits pages.\nWhile many books of this sort\nrisk falling into a monotonous tone,\nlisting properties and their causes,\nMiodownik draws the reader into his\nlife and his mind, and explains why\nthe world of materials has held his\ninterest for so long.\nHe begins with a funny anecdote of\nhis first encounter with the various\nproperties of materials \u2013 namely,\nbeing stabbed as a schoolboy.\nAlthough this introduction\nseems to be a hard act to follow, the\nbook continues with similar flair\nthroughout. Miodownik combines\namusing backstories with technical\nexplanations, maintaining the\naffability and humor that engaged the\nreader at the start while addressing\nthe material at a suitable level so as to\nbe interesting.\nNo matter your level of knowledge\nin materials science, this captures\nyour interest without seeming either\ndull or aloof. Stuff Matters is a book\nwhich would appeal to an extremely\nwide range of readers, from those\nwith little to no scientific background\nto those who may have been in a\nscientific field for years.\nEach chapter begins with a rather\ningenious method of illustrating\nhow reliant our world is upon the\nmaterials that are discussed in the\nbook, and emphasizes how little the\naverage person tends to think about\nhow these vital materials came to be\nused in our daily lives. Miodownik\nuses a picture of himself, sitting on\nhis rooftop, and isolates individual\nmaterials present in the picture for\neach chapter.\nAfter briefly introducing the\nhistory of the item in question\nand the sentimental value, he then\njumps into the molecular and atomic\nbehavior of the material that define\nits crazy and unique characteristics.\nIn this way, he discusses everything\nfrom steel to paper, even managing\nto make concrete fascinating and\nPATRICIA POTHS the development of glass entrancing.\nThere\u2019s even a chapter devoted\nexclusively to the molecular\nattributes of chocolate! (That chapter\nwas mouth-watering as well as\ninteresting) At the end, Miodownik\ndevotes a chapter as an overview\nof the whole book to synergize the\nconcepts discussed in the previous\nchapters, and allows the reader to take\nin just how amazing the development\nof materials over the course of human\nhistory actually is.\nStuff Matters is an exceptional read,\nMiodownik animates the inanimate\nworld in such a way that you will\nnever be able to look at even a staple\nin the same way again. It is more\nthan a book recounting the different\nproperties of various materials.\nThe book is a vivid, deftly written,\nand a humorous account of why we\nshould all be interested in materials\nscience.\nSCIENCE WRITER\n\n"

Major reviews raved\nabout it, so I took the plunge on\nGone Home \u2013 the first effort of The\nFullbright Company.\nYou play as Kaitlin Greenbriar, a\nfairly typical 21 year-old American\ngirl just back from her year-long trip\nto Europe. However, when you enter\nyour (absolutely massive) house you\nfind it completely deserted; neither\nyour sister nor your parents at home.\nYour objective is to find out what the\nhell has gone on.\nThe game mechanics are very\nsimple: you walk around your house,\nentering every single room and\ninvestigating objects, learning more\nabout the recent actions of your\nfamily members with every opening\nof a door. You quickly learn that\ndespite being able, there is no point\npicking up pens and other mundane\nobjects.\nHowever, there is a lot to be learnt\nfrom your fathers\u2019 own fiction books\nabout JFK, old family mementos\nand, in particular, your sisters\u2019\npossessions.\nWith some of the items, your\nsister\u2019s voice comes out of nowhere\nto provide a bit of background\nknowledge \u2013 which is a relief\nconsidering you would hear nothing\nelse but the eerie storm outside and\nthe exaggerated creaking of your\nhouse\u2019s floorboards.\nGraphically, this game is amazing\nconsidering the modest size of the\ncompany behind it. Manipulatable\nobjects are well crafted and written\nnotes all have a personal feel about\nthem. In some ways it is a shame\nthat the gameplay is limited to the\nbeautifully designed house.\nThe game will take you about 3-4\nhours and whether you will enjoy it\nhas very little to do with the simple\ngameplay or graphics \u2013 Gone Home\nis all about a story.\nTaking such little time to complete\nit, Gone Home feels more like a\nshort novel or long movie, where you\nhave control over which rooms are\nexplored and in what order.

What it lacks in\nthrills, it will compensate in heart-wrenching plot twists.\nTo summarise, this is the sort of\ngame that you will want to pick up\non the Steam Winter sale rather\nthan fork out \u00a314.99 on.

A\ngreat play maybe, but a shocking case\nof trivialising a scarily dark issue.\nI may not have found King Charles\nIII particularly funny but I cannot\ndeny that Mike Bartlett\u2019s new play is\nan exceptional work.\nUsually performed by Tim PigottSmith, Charles\u2019 understudy Miles\nRichardson stepped up to replace him\nwith an exemplary performance (even\nif he does look a good twenty years\ntoo young), supported by a superb cast\n(less one or two theatrical dunces).\nDirected by Rupert Goold, the play\ncentres around Charles\u2019 role as king\nafter his mother Elizabeth II dies\nVoyeur at the Courtauld: Schiele\u2019s Radical Nude Impresses\nTim Pigott-Smith as King Charles III. Photo: Johan\nPersson\nTwo Girls Embracing (Friends) 1915. Egon Schiele\n(sometime around 2022 apparently).\nA little too enthusiastic about his\nnewfound \u201cceremonial\u201d powers, and\nall too eager to leave his mark as\nBritain\u2019s greatest ever monarch, the\ncountry is left in turmoil following\nCharles\u2019 refusal to sign a new bill.\nAlthough the likelihood of such\nan event taking place nowadays\nis (hopefully) extremely remote,\nthe play does raise serious and\nuncomfortable questions about the\nrole of the British monarchy\nBartlett\u2019s play unravels like a\nShakespearean epic and touches on all\nthe facets of these alarming questions\nas part of a stunning new play.\nIf Bartlett\u2019s script had been left like\nthis, maybe it\u2019d be the best new work\nof the year. But like all the great royal\nstories, Harry\u2019s so-called girlfriend is\nportrayed as a ditsy, pretty, not very\nopinionated slut (not my ideal choice\nof words but it\u2019s how it comes across),\nand for some reason Diana\u2019s ghost\ndecides to glide across the stage every\nnow and then, in a ridiculous, panto\nstyle joke.\nIt wasn\u2019t a huge issue, and it\ncertainly didn\u2019t spoil the show, but\nit is a real shame that whenever the\nroyals are spoken about, what would\notherwise be considered a real, serious\nKing Charles III \u2013 Princely Propaganda or Royalist Treat?\nMax Falkenberg asks if this play glosses over an important issue\nproblem is simply trivialised with\nsome stupid joke about Camilla\u2019s\nhorse-face.\nThe performances of those\ncharacters playing serious roles in\nthe show were exceptional, with\nLydia Wilson as Princess Kate\nbeing a particular stand out. But\nagain, poor casting and unfriendly\nwriting meant that regardless of\nperformance quality, several of the\ncasts smaller roles felt stunted and\nwere unfortunately performed with\nlittle conviction.\nI must admire Mike Bartlett\u2019s\nattempt in writing a play about such a\ntouchy issue, but I can\u2019t help but feel\nhe lost his way somewhere.\nYes, the show is gripping\nthroughout. Yes, the cast is great.\nYes, the pretty red steps on the blank\nstage provide a perfect framing for\nsuch a show. But the next time I go\nsee a show about real people and real\nissues, don\u2019t get a clown to prance all\nover the stage and make the whole\nidea look ridiculous.\nThat\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t a great\nshow, but you better be a royalist for\nit not to annoy you.\nKing Charles III is on at Wynham\u2019s\nTheatre, until 31st January.\n\"A real,\nserious\nproblem\nis simply\ntrivialised\nwith some\nstupid\njoke about\nCamilla's\nhorse-face.\"\nAmention of sex in any context,\nreally, is usually enough to get\npeople excited (pun intended).\nAfter all, to quote Oscar Wilde:\n\u201cEverything in the world is about sex,\nexcept sex. Sex is about power\u201d.\nIt is clear to spectators of The\nRadical Nude \u2013 the first solo exhibit\nof Egon Schiele\u2019s nudes in the UK \u2013\nthat in all of the paintings, whether\ndark tones or vivid bright colors,\nthere is an unexpected sense of the\npower of the imperfect naked human\nform. And so, in that sense, Schiele\nrevolutionized the traditionally\nfragile and limp take on the nude.\nWith his \u201cradical nudes\u201d, Schiele\nis equally successful and scandalous\nin breaking both the artistic\nconventions and social taboos of his\ntime. Paradoxically, there is a kind\nof unnaturally natural and softly\naesthetic beauty in the way the sharp\nangles, inorganic colors, and awkward\nposes complement each other and\nform the total work of art.\nWhile Schiele employs\nunconventionally bold colors to\nanimate and charge some of his\nnudes with sexual energy, he uses\nsolely dark, deathly tones in others.\nThese nudes are even further from\ntraditional, conveying not only a far\nfrom idealised image of the human\nform, but one moreover dark and\ndiseased. Schiele\u2019s friends called this\nstyle \u201cthe death beneath the skin\u201d,\nand it is one the artist used often to\nfurther complicate the eroticism of\nthe nude with a Freudian conflict of\ndesire and death.\nThese nudes are clearly alive, but\nat the same time are also dying. This\ndichotomy, which runs through all\nof Schiele\u2019s work, is what gives it\nits wonderful, heady tension, and\nsyphilitic energy.\nThough bordering on pornography\nand enough to certainly raise a few\nearly 20th century brows, Schiele\u2019s\nnudes are never mindlessly erotic,\nbut rather sophisticatedly sexy.\nThe works at The Radical Nude are\noften psychologically symbolic and\nphilosophically suggestive.\nFor example, in Two Girls Embracing\n(1915), Schiele paints one woman\nconventionally while the other\nappears more as a doll with dull point\neyes. This detail gives the painting a\nfurther symbolically dynamic depth\nbeyond the - at that time scandalous \u2013\nlesbian implications.\nMoreover, in many of the exhibited\npaintings, the figures demonstrate\nSchiele\u2019s characteristically alien and\nunnatural gestures, which despite\nbeing expressive, seem to hold some\nmysterious coded meaning.\nThis analysis could be applied to all\nof Schiele\u2019s work, which is perhaps\nwhy their legacy has lasted for nearly\na century. In the history of the nude\n\u2013 an artistic canon that stretches\nfrom the Venus of Willindorf,\nthrough Da Vinci, and all the way to\ncontemporary artists like Tracy Emin\n\u2013 Schiele\u2019s work stands out as bold,\nunique, and visceral.\nIt is perhaps the elusive nature of\nSchiele\u2019s nudes more so than their\nsexual subject that captivates the\naudience. For a moment one manages\nto grasp the intention behind the pose\nand colors and lines but the moment\npasses, and the meaning evades\nthe observer. The nudes cannot be\nfully understood (much like Schiele\nhimself) and that is perhaps why they\ncontinue to fascinate generation after\ngeneration.\nEgon Schiele: The Radical Nude, is\non at The Courtald Gallery, located\nin Somerset House. It runs from 23rd\nOctober until 18th January.\nTickets are \u00a38.50 for adults, \u00a37.50 for\nstudents. Free for members.\n\"Though\nbordering on\npornography,\nSchiele's\nnudes\nare never\nmindlessly\nerotic, but\nrather sexy.\"\nELIZAVETA TCHEBANIOUK\nARTS WRITER\n\n"

    "content": "46 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n07.11.2014\nC & S Editor Ben Howitt\nClubs and Societies\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nLast Wednesday, in typical\ngloomy and rainy weather,\nmyself and eleven other\nImperial girls from ICU Pole Dance\ntrekked over to Hammersmith for\nthe society\u2019s very first Aerial \u2018taster\u2019\nsession.\nAerial is a form of acrobatics, which\nis becoming increasingly popular as\na fitness craze, and not just amongst\nwomen! It\u2019s a full body workout,\nincredible for your core strength and\nflexibility. It\u2019s also been featured on\nBBC\u2019s Tumble, shows by Cirque du\nSoleil and adverts for Sony\u2019s PS3.\nWe arrived at Aerialand, and were\ngreeted by a bubbly instructor called\nDiego. He led us through a thorough\nwarm ups and stretches, and then\nwe started with silks \u2013 two strips of\ncoloured fabric suspended from the\nceiling.\nHaving a year\u2019s worth of experience\nof pole (albeit on and off with\ncoursework, exams, and summer), I\nwasn\u2019t sure what to expect with silks.\nThe first move Diego taught us was\nYou want me to put my hands where!?\nAlisha Wong tries out the newest circus class to hit Imperial\nDiego coaching a new student through a straddle. Photo: Facebook\nOk, so pole and aerial aren't that\ndifferent. Photo: Facebook\n\"It's\na full\nbody\nworkout\"\n\"there\u2019s\na fear of\nfalling\noff the\nhoop!\"\ncalled a French climb, a way to get up\nthe silks without doing pull ups.\nOf course, as with any instructor,\nhe made it look absolutely effortless.\nOur attempts to climb up the silks, as\nyou can probably imagine, were not\nas graceful as Diego\u2019s.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t think I would get\na head start with learning Aerials, I\nwas under the impression that the\nacrobatic sport would utilise the same\nmuscles and technique as pole. I was\nquite wrong. The first difference with\nsilks is how intensely your hands\nand feet have to grip the fabric. With\npole you have an advantage with\nyour skin, which is great for gripping\nagainst the pole even if you do get\nsome (many) friction burns here and\nthere. However, silks is about how\nwell you can tighten your hand and\nclamp the silk between your feet,\nand your ability to master a looping\naction with one of your legs to get the\nfabric in the right place!\nFor a first move it was challenging,\nbut after a few practices everyone got\nthe hang of it. Diego was great \u2013 he\nhad everyone perform the move in\nfront of him and helped you and gave\nadvice so you could master it.\nOur next moves on the silks were\nthe straddle and the pike. They\u2019re\nboth similar moves \u2013 you have to\nstand in front of the silks, wrap your\narms around the silks and grab on.\nYou then jump up and throw your\nlegs over your head [see below \u2013 sec.\ned]. Technically, the jump was a little\ncheat move that Diego let us get away\nwith, as we were all beginners.\nIn reality you would have to lift\nyour legs up and move them up over\nyour head with just your core strength\n\u2013 no momentum to help you!\nThe latter half of the class we had\na go with hoops, which I personally\nbelieved was easier than silk purely\nbecause it was easier to hold the hoop.\nDiego taught us how to climb onto\nand sit on the hoop \u2013 which again\ninvolved pulling ourselves upside\ndown. This time, we had to hold on\nwith our knees, before swinging up\nand using our momentum to come\nto sitting. Thankfully, Diego was on\nhand to give everyone step-by-step\ninstructions. Once on the hoop, Diego\nhad us balance sitting on the hoop\nwithout using your hands to grab it\n\u2013 this was a lot more difficult than it\nsounds, as there\u2019s a fear of falling off\nthe hoop!\nAfter a few practices, he taught\nus a hoop pose, where you sit on the\nhoop and turn slightly to the side,\nstraightening one leg while bending\nthe other. It was a very acrobatic\npose that, once again, was a lot more\ndifficult than it sounded! The last\nmove was a hoop spin whilst hanging\noff the hoop, not sat on the hoop. This\nwas a fun manoeuvre to finish off\nwith and after this, we stretched out.\nI had a really great time at the\nclass, and genuinely had plenty of\nfun, especially because Diego was so\nchatty. The other girls were also all\nvery supportive, helping each other\nimprove. The room was not a large\nroom and I think this significantly\nimproved the atmosphere of the\nclass. It was more cosy and friendly,\ncompared to the industrial, steel\nrigging, cold and empty room I\nimagined in my head!\nFor more information, contact\npoledance@ic.ac.uk about our classes.\nKATHERINE CHIO\nINTN\u2019L LIBERATION OFFICER\nLondon: a survival guide for international students\nDo you remember what it was\nlike when you first arrived\nin London?

The first year students\nwere ordered to strip completely\nNUDE and forced out of the train at\nOsterley station, where they had to\nKnit themselves some pants whilst on\nthe platform.\nNext, at Boston Manor, the initiates\nwere forced to then attempt to create\nsome trousers for themselves. Some of\nthe ICKS XV held the doors open for\none of the slower freshers, irritating\nsome already shocked TfL passengers.\nBy the time the train pulled\ninto Hammersmith, most of the\nKnitSock freshers had managed to\nget themselves moderately clothed.\nHowever the intensely loud clacking\nof needles and boorish chanting of the\nKnitSock committee had overwhelmed\nmost of the passengers on the service\nand the train terminated early.\nUnperturbed, the team then\nmarched through Hammersmith\nshopping centre chanting \u201cGet your\nKnits out for the Lads\u201d before boarding\na number 9 bus for the union. Whilst\non board, the out-of-control crafters\ncross-stitched \u201cBus Wanker\u201d onto\nthe hat of the conductor and a heated\nargument between two 3rd year\nstudents over the merits of Cables vs\nBobbles resulted in one threatening\nthe other with a hammer and a window\nwas smashed.\nWhen Hangman tried to contact\nAloysius Stich, the team captain, we\nreceived a pair of mittens with \u201cKnit\nFast, Die Warm\u201d written across the\npalms.\nWe approached the Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies) for\nthe Union\u2019s opinion on the future\nof the club. She reassured us that the\nsociety would be allowed next year but\nsuggested that, in terms of captaincy;\nA. Stich would be dropped.\nSix second years have realised that\nliving in your own house for the\nfirst time is not living up to their\nexpectations. Nearly five weeks in to\nterm and the fun of having their own\nflat has started to wear thin. The first\nthree weeks were spent having house\nparties, working out a cleaning rota\nthat everyone stuck to for 3 days and\nthen ignored, and spending 4 hours on\nhold to Virgin Media trying to get the\nbroadband sorted out. Now, however,\ntensions have begun to show.\nThe first flatmate to realise things\nmight not be all amazing was Ellen, a\nphysicist. \u201cI was having the time of my\nlife really, living outside of halls with a\nload of people I thought were cool, but\nI\u2019m beginning to realise it\u2019s a pain in\nthe fucking arse,\u201d she told Hangman.\n\u201cThings were going okay but then\nDave just started walking around\nthe whole flat in his boxers and, well,\nthey\u2019re not even nice boxers\u201d.\nWhen approached for comment by\nHangman, Dave told us \u201cGod the flat\nwas really cool but now Ellen starts\nwhining if you leave your plate in\nthe kitchen sink for like five minutes\nwithout washing it up. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nWhen pushed on the pants issue he\nreplied \u201cWell she just pushes her bike\nstraight through the flat to the yard\nout back without caring about the\nmess she makes in the hallway, so if\nshe can treat it like she owns the place,\nwhy can\u2019t I?\u201d\nFurther to the strains between Dave\nand Ellen, who both have rooms on\nthe ground floor of the terraced house\njust off Fulham Palace Road, further\nanimosity is brewing between two of\nthe first floor residents: Raheela and\nJessica. \u201cShe\u2019s just the worst person\nin the world to share a bathroom\nwith,\u201d Raheela, who had an en-suite\nroom in halls, told Hangman. \u201cShe\u2019s\ngot this thick ginger frizzy hair and\nI\u2019m pulling about 4kg of it out of the\nsinkhole every morning when I want\nto have a shower.\u201d\nMeanwhile Jessica has found that\nher toiletries keep disappearing,\ntelling this correspondent \u201cfucking\nhell, Raheela keeps stealing my\nexfoliating body scrub and I swear to\ngod that stuff is so expensive. She\u2019s\nsuch a brat, she thinks she\u2019s entitled to\neverything, I\u2019ve had enough already,\u201d\nthis opinion was echoed by Dave,\nwho had seen her drinking his orange\njuice a week previous without asking\nbeforehand.\nCurrently feelings towards Yannis,\n\u2014 who hasn\u2019t left his attic room\nafter the first housewarming party,\nduring which he stood in a corner\nand would only talk about Bitcoin \u2014\nare ambivalent. His only annoying\nact so far so far is installing the 25\nmetre long internet cable from the\nmodem that snakes up both staircases\nand under his door. However when\nthe first electricity bill arrives in\nJanuary and the others realise that\nhe\u2019s running a mining rig in his room\ncosting them \u00a33,400 in electricity a\nquarter, feelings may sour.\nWhilst they may not talk to each\nother anymore, the five former\ncorridor friends from Wilkinson are\nunified in their hatred of the sixth:\nJasper Toff-Woodhole, a boorish\nMedic who is driving them all insane.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how inconsiderate he\nis\u201d Jessica confided. Dave reported that\nJasper \u2014 or \u2018Jazzy\u2019 to his insufferable\ntwat friends who turn up at 11 pm and\nshout to him from the street \u2014 has\na terrible habit of not knocking on\ndoors. This resulted in an awkward\nsituation when he walked in on Jessica\nand her boyfriend during the second\nweek. \u201cI think Jess would\u2019ve forgiven\nhim eventually if he hadn\u2019t then got\nhis phone out and sent a snapchat\nto everyone,\u201d Dave said. Jazzy was\nunreachable for comment as he\u2019s\ncurrently in A&E getting shards of bus\nwindow glass removed from his hand.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll probably pass it off as banter,\u201d\nRaheela said, about the window\nincident, but if he wasn\u2019t paying so\nmuch more rent for the slightly larger\nroom then we\u2019d kick him out in an\ninstant.\nAt the time of going to press, Dave\nhad found that Jessica was tweeting\nbitchy stuff about them all from\nan anonymous account and had\nemailed a link to the others. Raheela\nis staying late in the library to avoid\nthe inevitable row that was going\nto break out and is complaining to\nall her increasingly bored friends\nabout it. Yannis\u2019s participation in a\ndeepweb hacker circle has them all\nunder observation by GCHQ, whose\noperative have just analysed a photo\nsent to their flat whatsapp group\nby Jazzy of his blood soaked hand\nwith the caption \u201c#Lad\u201d. They are all\ndiscreetly asking their friends if any of\nthem have any spare rooms.\nOne of the sources of contention between the slovenly jerk and the stuck-up neat-freak\n\n"

I don\u2019t know about you,\nbut it definitely makes me wonder\nsometimes, does it actually live up to\nits reputation? I therefore decided to\npay a short visit to the Greek islands:\nSantorini to testify to its postcard\nbeauty and Crete, to check out the\ndark horse.\nI spent a total of five days in Greece,\ntwo days in Santorini and three days\nin Crete. Admittedly, Santorini can\nbe depicted as all the words that are\nsynonymous with picturesque, it is\nswift on sweeping you off your feet;\nCrete on the other hand is something\nelse, it slowly grows on you and just\nleaves you dazzled with delight.\nWhen I first set foot on Greek soil,\nI was frankly a bit disappointed.\nI\u2019ve spent months gaping at all the\nbeautiful pictures of Santorini on\nmy friends\u2019 Instagram and Facebook\nprofiles. I was under the assumption\nthat the whole of Santorini looked\nlike Oia, the only part of Santorini\nthat occupied a big chunk of your\nromantic dreams. Little did I know\nthat only 10% of the entire island\nlooked like the pictures on the\ninternet! If you rent a car and drive\nalong the island, you\u2019ll discover the\ntrue landscape of Santorini \u2013 which\nis a desert of nothing! The ground is\nliterally screaming for moisture, the\ngrass so dry that it would have driven\naway any kind of herbivore and this\nwas not exactly the sight that I signed\nup for.\nIf you speak to the locals about the\nbeaches, the ones that are commonly\nmentioned are Perivolos, Perissa,\nKamari etc also known as the black\nsand beach, red beach. I know, such\ncatchy names, don\u2019t you think? Please\ndo not be fooled like I was. Thinking\nthat the beaches might be able to offer\na redemption, I drove to a couple of\nthem in high spirits. When I got to\nthe black sand beach, I quickly left\nmy sandals in the car because I was\nindeed a tad too eager to sink my feet\ninto some soft sand. Lo and behold,\nthe sand felt prickly, a complete let\ndown of the visuals of warm sand that\nslips around your feet I had in mind.\nWith every bad thing comes a good\nside, and vice versa. I hope I haven\u2019t\ncompletely ruined Santorini for you\njust yet. There is the most amazing\ngyros pita (Greek version of kebab)\nstore called Obelix that will change\nyour perception of kebabs for the rest\nof your life.\nDid I mention that it\u2019s easy on the\npocket too? Most things on the menu\ncost less than 3 euros, what a way to\nstick to your budget! Additionally,\nthe boat trip to the nearby volcano is\ndefinitely one for the books. Imagine\nyourself sitting on a quaint maritime\nsail ship reminiscent of Pirates of\nthe Caribbean that brings you to an\nactive volcano. From the peak of the\nvolcano, you get spectacular views of\nthe Aegean Sea and a quick soak in the\nhot springs nearby.\nI\u2019m sure those who have been\nto Santorini are just waiting for\nthe mention of the famous Oia\nsunset. Tourists flock to this village\nevery evening just to catch the sun\ndrowning in the horizon. There are a\nfew ways to have an unforgettable and\ndesirable sunset experience.\nOne should make a reservation with\nthe restaurants on Ammoudi Bay and\nnear the cliffs that offer a spectacular\ndining experience which comes with a\nview of the sunset.\nAlternatively, you could join a\nsailing trip or rent a private yacht to\nappreciate the beauty of the island\nand see the sunset with unobstructed\nviews.\nUnfortunately, the word limit\ndoes not allow for a Greek island\nshowdown. I would have to save my\nCretian experience for the next time!\nWith five whopping storeys of\nvintage and second hand fashion that\nwon\u2019t break your budget, you will be\nrunning around getting your mitts\non anything that catches your eyes.\nWhether you are in it for the trend\nor simply because it is way more\naffordable than high street shops, the\nindividuality and variety is a good\nalternative to get a unique souvenir\nof Berlin.\nAddress: Frankfurter Tor 3, 10243\nBerlin\nStation: U5, Tram 10 / Frankfurter\nTor\nOpen: Mon-Sat 10:00 \u2013 20:00\nTel.

The lab\nwill be installed on the roof of the\nCity and Guilds building, and will\nhave also teaching facilities for\nUndergraduates and Postgraduates.\nIt will house a workshop for\nmanufacturing aerial robots, and will\nfeature an arena to put the new flying\nrobots to the test. There will also be\nfacilities to test the robots in water\ntoo, which will aid the development\nof robots for search and rescue\nmissions.\nThe aerial arena will have sixteen\nhigh speed 3D aerial tracking\ncameras, whilst the water tank will\nfeature a further eight to track\nto robots as they swim and dive\nthroughout the water.\nThe lab was funded by Dr Brahmal\nVasudevan, an alumnus of Imperial\nCollege London, who donated the\n\u00a31.25m costs in full.

Pics: Raw Kristina, Health Me Up\nMichelle Tan explores both the longstanding and the faddy\nRed in my ledger\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nSECTION EDITOR\nI managed to get a trip down memory lane this\nweek\u2013well,this was when I was making a batch of\nred velvet cupcakes for our ed-in-chief\u2019s birthday\non Tuesday (happy birthday again Philippa!) Many\nmoons ago,when I was a not-so-jaded fresher,I was\nactually known amongst some peers as the queen\nof red velvet.I totally blame the South Kensington\noutpost of the Hummingbird Bakery for this one;\nthey were the ones who sold me my irst red velvet\ncake,and I fell in love.\nMy mum\u2019s the baker in our family,so it\u2019s not like I\ndidn\u2019t grow up around bread and cakes.However,she\nhardly ever makes anything that uses food colouring\n(she isn\u2019t as keen about working with it)\u2013which is\nwhy I had never tried red velvet cake prior to moving\nto London.My only niggle at the time with the HB\noffering was that the icing was crazy-sweet,and\nthat I wanted a slightly more pronounced chocolate\nflavour in my cake,so the kitchen-hacker in me was\ndying to experiment\u2013which I did,of course.\nCut to spring term in my fresher year,where I\nended up making loads of red velvet cupcakes for\na number of occasions: at least a few fundraisers\n(ex-Felix Editor Kadhim\u2019s Skeleton Fund and the MSF\nbake sales),a number of birthdays and potlucks,and\nduring one bad low in my depression,\u201cjust because\u201d.\nSure beats being an unproductive blob in front of a\nHowIMetYourMothermarathon.Thankfully no one\nhas been poisoned by my bakes,so I think I\u2019m okay...?\nSince then I\u2019ve deinitely moved on to add more\ncakes and sweets to my repertoire; however,red\nvelvet\u2019s deinitely got a special place in my heart,and\none that I come back to now and again.Those who\nknow me will know that there are very few desserts\nthat I make (semi-)regularly,as I\u2019m always keen on\ntrying new things; tiramisu (for family gatherings\nin Malaysia) and cr\u00e9me brul\u00e9e are the only others\napart from red velvet.It\u2019s also encouraged me to\nexperiment more and not be afraid of working with\nfood colouring; anyone who\u2019s seen my log cake with\nmy handmade fondant Pok\u00e9mon will be able to tell\nyou how far I\u2019ve come since then.\nThe title of this editorial also has another meaning\n(apart from being an Avengers reference as well\n\u2013NEW MOVIE TRAILER LEAKED OMG MUCH\nEXCITE!): often there are many who get conned\ninto going broke,overhauling their diets to follow\nthe latest fad,and just as many lament how it\u2019s so\nexpensive to eat healthily (newsflash: TV dinners\ncost more!).This tends to be truer in America where\nit can be cheaper to eat out (my foodie boyfriend\nspent two terms on an inal year project in Potsdam,\nNY\u2013every Skype convo had a lament about how high\nfructose corn syrup was EVERYWHERE).\nEither way,Michelle\u2019s taken a look at some\ncharacteristics of the more-known diets in this\nweek\u2019s feature\u2013we hope this\u2019ll educate others a bit\nmore.Yes,there always is a leeeeetle bit of start-up\ncost when one makes some dietary changes,that\nsaid,no one says you\u2019ve got to totally change your\neating in one go.For broke students like us,tweaking\nbit-by-bit is probably better for both your wallet and\nfor maintaining healthier habits long-term-\u2013you\u2019re\nmore likely to stick to it than if you made a crazy-drastic change.Enjoy,and I\u2019ll see you next week!\nNowadays there seems to be\na host of diets that we have\nheard of but know nothing\nabout. And yet, people still seem to\nthink that these diets are good for\ntheir health. But do we really know\nwhat we are getting ourselves into?\nThe media today is so\noverwhelmingly influential that it\ncan convince anyone to jump on\nthe bandwagon. So now is the time\nto clear up all the rumours, debunk\nsome diets out there and find out\nwhat they are really all about.\nGluten Free (GF)\nIt has gotten a lot of attention\nlately for being a \u201chealthier\u201d diet, but\nthe main reason for the increased\nhype is due to a spike in people with\ngluten intolerance; whether from\ncoeliac disease, wheat allergies or\nnon-coeliac gluten sensitivity. For\nclarification, only the first of these is\nan autoimmune disease.\nIn recent years, food manufacturers\nhave jumped on this increased\ndemand for GF food products, so\nnow we find that there is a section in\nevery supermarket containing GF\nfood. Some have been able to attract\npurchases with a preconceived notion\nthat they are somehow \u201chealthier\u201d\nand \u201ccleaner\u201d. There might be some\ntruth to this, as some (especially\nwomen) seem to find that lowering\ntheir gluten consumption helps to\nkeep bloating at bay. Whether this\nis just a placebo effect has yet to be\ndetermined, though. In addition,\ncutting out gluten tends to mean\nleaving out a variety of wheat\nproducts (which tend to be high-calorie), so in most cases GF dieters\ndo end up losing weight.\nHowever, just because these\nspecialist foods are labeled \u201cgluten\nfree\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\naren\u2019t loaded with sugar and other\nunhealthy ingredients. Nevertheless,\nfor true allergy/intolerance sufferers,\nthese might be the only option.\nThat said, any beneficial effects\nof going GF are easily nullified if\nyou don\u2019t supplement your carbs\nwith enough protein, fruit or veg - in\nfact, it can be very easy to end up\nnutritionally imbalanced on this diet.\nPaleo\nThis is a slightly newer diet trend\nthat has become popular amongst\nhealth nuts, and is in some aspects\nour last-ditch effort to somehow\nmake our \u2018growing\u2019 population grow\na little less (sideways, that is). This\nmeans eating how cavemen eat:\nanything you could hunt or find,\nyou can eat, but everything else is\nforbidden.\nYou might be thinking that the\n\u201cback-to-caveman-basics\u201d association\nis a bit of a marketing ploy, but it\ndoes have some scientific basis.\nThe average human back then was\nmuscular, agile and fit \u2013 compared to\nthe overweight, out of shape, stressed\nand sleep-deprived average human of\nnow. Paleo followers believe that the\ndifference is in the food we consume,\nand that our nutritional needs have\nyet to change from those of our\ncavemen ancestors \u2013 so why change\nfrom them?\nAs such, this diet consists of eating\nvegetables, fruits and meat - without\nany dairy, grains, sugar or processed\nfood (agriculture wasn\u2019t a thing in\nthe Paleolithic era, hence the ban on\ngrains; fibre can still be obtained via\nall sorts of fruit and veg).\nIt isn\u2019t without its critics however,\nas health experts cite the increased\nrisks of cancer that seem to be linked\nwith higher meat consumption.\nNevertheless, if you are feeling\nlethargic, living on 8 cups of coffee\na day with energy levels near the\nfloor, followers swear by the increase\nin energy Paleo provides. Perhaps\nswitch up just one of your meals in\nthe day to Paleo \u2013 there\u2019s no harm in\neating more fruits and vegetables!\nRaw\nI\u2019ve come across a YouTuber called\n\u201cRaw Kristina\u201d who has eaten raw\nfor almost 10 years, and has shown\nher viewers that contrary to popular\nbelief she isn\u2019t nutritionally deficient.\nProponents believe that applying\nheat to food actually doesn\u2019t have any\nnutritional benefit (even lowering it\nin some cases), except for preventing\nus from getting food poisoning \u2013 and\nwe wouldn\u2019t get food poisoning in\nthe first place if we didn\u2019t have foods\nlike meat as part of our diet. As most\nraw foods are naturally low-fat and\nlow-calorie, weight loss naturally goes\nhand in hand with it.\nThere is no cooking involved so\nfood prep can be incredibly quick\nand easy, and raw foodies like\nKristina swear by regular use of\na blender in order to make their\nraw smoothies and salad dressings.\nHowever, becoming a real raw foodie\ncan sometimes be difficult. Cost is\nusually the key inhibiting factor\n\u2013 since everything you are eating is\nraw, followers tend to go organic as\nwell (to minimize ingested nasties\nlike pesticides), which hikes up your\ngrocery budget.\nThen there\u2019s gadgetry. Dehydrators\nare another tool often used by raw\nfoodies, but these can often take\nforever to prepare a batch of food.\nAlso, being a raw foodie when you\nlike socializing and eating out with\nfriends can be inconvenient at times.\nSo yes, a raw food diet can be\npotentially cleansing for the system,\nbut to go all out can require a\nsubstantial amount of money, effort\nand time. It would be more practical\nto maybe try out a couple of raw\nmeals if you are feeling bloated, or\njust need a mid-week pick-me-up!\nConclusion\nThese examples are only the tip\nof the iceberg. In most cases, proper\nlongstanding diets have one thing in\ncommon: balance and moderation.\nYour schedule might dictate that\nsome \u2018rules\u2019 are more practical and\neasier to follow than others, and that\u2019s\nfine as long as your body is healthy\nand happy.\nEach diet has its own set of\nfollowers \u2013 whether you choose to\ngo all out with one diet, or pick a few\nbits of each and incorporate them\ninto your lifestyle, your health and\nwell-being are of utmost priority.\nThe most important thing is to be\nadventurous and keep trying a variety\nof new things so you don\u2019t get stuck in\nany unhealthy ruts.\nHave fun eating healthy and trying\nout new recipes; if they happen to be\ngluten free, paleo or raw then that\u2019s\nan added bonus!\n\"Each diet\nhas its\nown set of\nfollowers\"\n\n"

This involves the academic\nunion\u2019s members ceasing to carry\nout all work relating to setting and\nmarking any assessed coursework. In\na UCU briefing pamphlet to students,\nit was mentioned that this \u201ccovers any\nsetting or marking which contributes\nto the award or classification of\nany degree, certificate, diploma or\nany other academic or professional\nqualification. It also covers\nprogression from one stage of study\nto the next.\u201d\nThere is as of yet no proposed\nend date to this industrial action;\nteaching, however, will proceed as\nnormal. Representatives from UCU\nare due to meet with UUK staff to\nresume negotiations on the 7th of\nNovember.\nThe pension cuts, which are\ncurrently being disputed, were\nproposed in order to make up a deficit\nin the USS pension pot, which stands\nat \u00a38bn. Explanations given by the\nUUK describe the USS scheme as it\ncurrently stands as \u201cunaffordable\u201d,\nciting an actuarial valuation carried\nout by the trustees of the USS in\nMarch \u2013 a process that weighed\nup the value of the scheme\u2019s assets\nagainst the amount needed to pay\npension rights already accrued, which\nuncovered the shortfall.\nIt also warned that this deficit is\nvolatile, and that according to the\nEmployers Pensions Forum (EPF),\nacademic institutions would need\nto increase contributions by nine\npercentage points to 25% if reforms\naren\u2019t introduced. EPF estimates that\nthis would cost institutions \u00a36m a\nyear and would result in job cuts, pay\nfreezes and recruitment freezes at\nuniversities nationwide.\nThe UCU has called into question\nthe methodology used to calculate\nthese proposals, with the University\nof Warwick voicing concern that\nthe proposals could make it harder\nfor pre-1992 institutions to attract\nand retain staff. Similarly, the\nUniversity of Oxford has labelled the\ninformation, produced by the UUK\nto explain the pension reforms, as\nhighly misleading.\nUnion members had taken part in\na ballot on the 1st of October, with\n78% of voters opting for strike action\nand 87% voting for action short of a\nstrike, which included the marking\nboycott. Turnout was at 45%, the\nhighest in a national higher education\nballot since the formation of UCU.\nThe UCU has also criticised UUK\nfor not presenting a greater variety\nof alternatives, with its general\nsecretary, Sally Hunt, commenting\non how \u201cthe employers\u2019 response\nto the ballot was to insist that their\nproposals were the best that could be\nachieved and they made it clear that\nthey considered the negotiations to be\nover before they had even begun.\u201d\nIn response to the call for\nindustrial action, Imperial College\nLondon\u2019s management sent an email\nannouncement to all UCU members\nin College on Friday 31 October,\nwhich has since been released on\nthe College homepage. Penned by\nLouise Lindsay, Director of Human\nResources, the announcement\nFelix has recently learnt of the\npassing of Tian Wei Chew,one of\nImperial College London\u2019s newest\nalumni,on the 2nd of November\n2014.As of going to print,the\ncircumstances surrounding Mr\nChew\u2019s death have yet to be made\nknown.\nThis is extremely tragic news\nand we extend our deepest\ncondolences to Tian Wei\u2019s family,\nfriends and coursemates.\nA fully-funded scholar under\nthe Singaporean government\u2019s\nAgency for Science,Technology\nand Research (A*STAR),Tian Wei\nrecently graduated with a First in\nBSc Biochemistry.Peers described\nhim as an\u201cincredibly helpful\nfriend/senior\u201dand an\u201camazingly\nhumble and kind\u201dindividual,with\nmany taking to his Facebook page\nto leave their tributes.\nA Union spokesperson on the\nTrustee Board said: Tian Wei was a\nbright,passionate and extremely\ncompetent young man with a real\nwanting to contribute to the wider\nstudent population through his\nroles he undertook in the Union,\nwith the last of these being one\nof the Union\u2019s irst Appointed\nStudent Trustees.\n\u201cOur condolences go to Tian Wei\u2019s\nfamily and friends at the sad time.\nHis contribution to both the Union\nand wider Imperial community\nwill be remembered fondly.\u201d\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nFelix\npays\ntribute to\nTian Wei\nChew\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nSECTION EDITOR\noutlined how 25% of pay would\nbe withheld from staff who chose\nto take part in the boycott. It\ndid, however, allow members the\noption to maintain full pension\ncontributions, as long as they gave\nwritten notice of intent to take part\nin the boycott at least three working\ndays in advance of the first day of\naction.\nThe statement mentions the\nfollowing: \u201cImperial is committed\nto providing our talented students\nwith an outstanding education and\nany action having a detrimental\nimpact on their experience is neither\nan appropriate nor effective route to\nresolve a dispute about staff pension\nbenefits.\u201d\nAs of present it is unknown\nwhether all Imperial College UCU\nmembers across all departments are\ntaking part in said marking boycott;\nhowever to Felix\u2019s knowledge,\nboth the Mathematics and EEE\ndepartments have issued email\nannouncements to their respective\nstudents.\nThe email from Professor\nJonathan Mestel, the Mathematics\ndepartment\u2019s Director of\nUndergraduate Studies (DUGS),\nstated that \u201c...it is only with great\nreluctance that lecturers would\ndo this, and it is indicative of the\nstrength of opinion... I would like\nto apologise for the situation that\nhas arisen, though it is outside our\ncontrol.\u201d\nhe email announcement that was\nsent by College management to the\nacademic union members, citing\nthat \u201cin my view, this was a very\nunhelpful letter from the College,\nwhose tone was deeply resented by\nseveral of your lecturers. Though\nI\u2019m sure it was sent to try to reduce\ndisruption to your studies, I suspect\nthe effect will be the opposite -people do not in my experience react\nwell to coercion.\u201d\nDetailed guidelines on how\nassessments would be affected for\nall Mathematics modules were also\nset out in the email, which includes\nprovisions for lecturers to re-designate any assessed coursework\nthat were intended to form a small\ncontribution of the overall course\nmark as \u201cnon assessed exercises\u201d.\nConversely, the email from Dr\nKristel Fobelets, the EEE DUGS, was\na shorter affair. It included links to\nstudent-targeted briefing statements\ndrafted by the UCU and a link to the\nCollege\u2019s statement on salary cuts\nfor union members who took action.\nSPONSORED EDITORIAL\n\n"
