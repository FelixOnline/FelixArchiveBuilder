    "content": "^ge 2\nFELIX January 28, 1971\nFRIENDS DESPAIR\nLast Summer term, on a sunny afternoon, when people\nat College were either relaxing in Princes Gardens enjoying\nthe good weather, or busily trying to get their computer\nprograms to work, a very lonely and distressed second\nyear jumped from the top of Southside, leaving a long note\nbehind, a sad goodbye to his friends, who never came to his\nrescue when there was still time.\nThis incident shocked the entire College, especially his\ntutors and the Health Centre. Where did things go wrong?\nWhat led a person of 20 years of age into such an act of\ndesperation? That time last year proved to be unusually\nbad for I.C. Two more people took their lives within the\nsame month, and more have followed last term. To avoid\ncausing any extra hardship on those concerned, all these\nsuicides are kept a closely guarded secret and no one hears\nabout them and, as a result, very few people realise the true\nextent of the problems of student stress.\nThe Samaritans Life is not only hard for students, it is hard for millions\nof others. Consequently about 6000 people a year in Great\nBritain alone cannot stand the pace. The problem of human\nstress is enormous and there is no absolute solution for it,\nbut even helping a few people out is worth all the trouble\none puts into it and with time these things add up.\nIn 1953 Chad Varah, an Anglican priest and a man of\ntremendous humanitarian qualities, used his Church (St.\nStephen Walbrook, in the City of London) and a telephone\nlist of suicidal people. He put a small ad in a London\nevening newspaper and received 27 calls in the first week.\nHe listened patiently to people's problems, showing them\nthat there was someone prepared to hear their troubles and\nthat they were not completely alone in an alien world.\nChad Varah was soon joined by hundreds of other vol-un te ers, listening to their clients' troubles and offering help.\nThe help of a needy friend. His organisation, called the\nSamaritans, a non-religious based organisation soon expanded with stations all over the country and today there are\nsome 12,000 trained volunteers in Great Britain alone. There\nare people from all kinds of social backgrounds and from\nage groups varying from 18 to well above 70. They are carefully selected after an extensive training in which they can\nlearn to be as open-minded as conceivably possible about\nanything and anybody and be good listeners. They work in\nstrict confidentiality and in collaboration with psychiatric\nestablishments and professional consultants.\nAs a result the national suicide rate has gone down and\nstudies done in 15 'samaritan' towns show a decline of 5.84%\nwhere as in 15 similar 'non-samaritan' towns there was an\nincrease of 19.84%.\nThe Samaritans still operate along their original lines. A telephone (for London\u2014626-9000) and a person at the other\nend to answer it 24 hours daily. The caller, or 'client' as he\nis referred to, can ask for anything from a piece of fatherly\nadvice, to some lusty sex talk from a female which will make\nhim ease off his sexual frustration. Whatever he asks for the\nSamaritan is trained to be able to give it. The 'client' is\nalways encouraged to come to the centre and talk things over,\nover a cup of coffee. In certain cases specialist psychiatrists\nare called in for help at any hour during the night.\nPresent Situations at I.C. At the moment people at I.C. who are under stress can\neither:\na) Go and talk to their tutor or supervisor and ask for\nadvice.\nb) Go and see Dr. Grey at the Health Centre in No. 14,\nPrincess Gardens, who\u2014if he thinks necessary will refer\nthem to the College psychiatrist, Dr. Storey, who visits the\nHealth Centre twice a week.\nc) Go and see the Medical Social Worker, Mrs. Hartnett,\nwho has just joined the College, also at the Health Centre\non Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. No prior appointment\nwill normally be necessary.\nd) Talk to their friends and hopefully get suitable advice\nand help.\nThese existing channels cover most troubled people during the day. But what about during the night when there is\nnobody around to help. If they are in deep distress and feel\nsuicidal they might call the Samaritans, but some people\nprefer to talk to members of their own age group, fellow students of the same College and with similar problems.\nAt the end of last year Harry Fairbrother suggested to\nJudith Walker that a scheme, similar to the Samaritans, run\nby students of this college, for the members of I.C. should\nbe set up. Dr. Grey has been very enthusiastic about the\nwhole idea and a meeting was held between the Welfare\nCommittee, representatives from the Samaritans, people\nfrom Essex University, who have already started a similar\nscheme on their campus called 'nightline'. Dr. Grey, some\nChad Varah, founder of the Samaritans\nCollege tutors and other interested parties, and the basic\nlines for the formation of such a group were drawn.\nInternational Conference on Telephonic Aid As a result of the meeting, the I.C. Union Welfare Officer\nand the Secretary of the Welfare Committee (Steve Cann)\nwent to a3 day conference over the vacation. The Title of\nthe Conference was 'Youth Emergency Telephonic Aid', and\nit mainly dealt with the problems of adolescence, suicide and\nthe setting up of youth services for people in distress. There\nwere delegates from all parts of Britain, Ireland, France,\nItaly, Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, Austria, Norway,\nPoland and Germany.\nThe Problems of Adolescence Adolescence is the psychological counterpart to physical\nmaturity and occurs in the period between the ages of 14\nor 15, right up to the ages of 21 to 22, and is the most critical time in psychological development.\nBefore adolescence, children normally trust their parents\nwith their problems. Although mentally disturbed children\nexist, one never hears of a child having committed suicide.\nAs soon as people enter the stage of adolescence they start\nfacing all the harder problems of life.\nOne in 12 people in this Country spend part of their adult\nlife in mental hospitals. If help were available to them earlier\non, this figure need not have been so high.\nSince the last decade counselling services in Britain have\nrapidly expanded. Unfortunately this expansion was not very\nwell planned and the help provided is by no means spread\nout.\nWhen a person is asking for help the first thing is for someone to listen to his problems and offer him his friendship. To\n'befriend' as the Samaritans call it. One should never attempt\nto deny the extent of the other person's problem and reducing it does not solve it. This can cause a certain mistrust on\nthe part of the other person by making him feel less important a human being than the rest.\nA person with a mental disturbance is in a very vulnerable\nposition. This vulnerability is not reduced by simple friend-ship. He is ready to accept any advice offered and one must\nbe very careful not to give any direct advice as, if anything\ngoes wrong, that person's trust will be completely shattered,\nas he is unlikely to turn again for help, even to other people.\nIn such cases professional ph y chi at ric treatment is necessary\nfor complete cure. Befriending only delays the crisis.\nBut, as it can be said that just as war is too serious a problem to leave to generals, the problems of mental health are\ntoo serious to leave to the psychiatrist on his own. Action\nby common lay people can go a long way in helping those\nwho need it.\nOther Universities The Essex University 'Nightline' is the only student organisation running at the moment on a campus. Others are starting at Brunei (London) and St. Andrews (Scotland).\nEssex University have a small hut on the campus with a telephone manned every night. Volunteers enter the scheme\nafter two weeks training. To provide continuity, a number\nof members of staff are engaged in this as well.\nWhen a 'client' calls he is always encouraged to go over.\nThe events are recorded in a log book, with no names and\nno further records are kept. There are group leaders who\ncan be contacted in emergencies, or whose advice can be\nsought afterwards. The number of calls to the centre have\nincreased as more people come to-hear of it, and a lot of\nstudents who would never have gone to the local Samaritan\nbranch, ask for help at 'Nightline'.\nVarious similar groups operate on some Continental Universities, some of them providing a telephone link only, some,\nlike Essex, personal contact as well.\nGeneral Meeting at I.C.on February4 th Universities tend to be small communities of their own,\nwith little contact with the outside world. This kind of environment tends to create rather special problems and I.C. is no exception. We are all students and have to face either\nexams or supervisors sooner or later. Many students in London have to live in appalling accommodation at extortionate\nrents, miles away from College and other friends. On top of\nthat I.C. is a highly specialised scientific institution where it\nis inevitable that, for some people to excel themselves they\nhave to be narrow minded and lose their sense of humanity.\nFinally I.C. has only 300 women in a college of 4,000 stu-dents. Sexual frustration and complete lack of contact with\nthe opposite sex can cause severe depression and create a vicious circle which can only end in disaster.\nThere are many people in this College who are socially\naware. Clubs like O.S.S. prove this. These kinds of people,\ntogether with a few members of staff, who can provide continuity for the organisation, can help run such a group here\nat I.C. The Samaritans have already offered to help with the training scheme and lectures will be arranged for the first group\nof volunteers.\nA meeting has been arranged by the Welfare Committee\nfor all people interested in this, on Thursday, February 4th at 6.00 p.m. in Physics Lecture Theatre A. Anyone who feels that he or she, as a member of this\ncommunity called Imperial College, can help some of its\nmembers who are now in difficulty, should make an effort\nto come along. Be a friend yourself, to others and then you\ntoo can rely on finding a friend in an hour of need.\nG.A.C. Assimakis,\nI.C.U. Welfare Officer.\nNUS USC\nThe third Universities Specialist Conference was held at\nKeele University on 2nd5 th January. This Conference, unlike the two national conferences whose major job is that\nof debating motions and thus preparing national mandates,\nis one based on more detailed discussion of a number of\ntopics, especially important within the University Sector.\nDiscussion groups were held on Secondary and Higher\nEducation exams, postgraduate education, the Open University, Continuing Higher Education, Technology\u2014Education relationships, Comprehensive systems of Higher Education, Strategy for Student Action, Community Action related Curricula and University Government. Working groups\nof a more specialist nature run on grants, Loan Financed\nHousing, Quinquennial Planning, Legal Status of Students\nUnions, Privy Council and Student Counselling, Also papers\non Bridge Years and four term Years were debated, whilst\nthe N.U.S./ N. C.C.L. paper 'Academic Freedom and the\nLaw' was investigated, discussed and debated.\nMany of the topics were discussed with regard to the political environment, but it can be seen that all are important\ntopics for discussion and action within the student body as a whole.\nPerhaps the most direct advantage gained by the I.C. delegates at this conference, I feel, was the meeting of other\ndelegations and the learning of their approaches to problems we have at this college\u2014this inter-University feeding of\ninformation is perhaps the most neglected field for action\nwithin many Universities\u2014we all have our problems, but\nmost have been solved elsewhere. Side effects included meeting N.U.S. services personnel\u2014important matters like the setting up of Endsleigh Insurance bureau, full-time within I.C. and the nature of I.C./ N.U.S. Travel bureaux relationships\nwere discussed, the former holding promise of much needed\nadvertising material in both Felix and the Handbook.\nFinally, one motion was moved directly forward for debate at a National Conference\u2014this time it was a Counselling Services motion (problems with respect to Tutors, Carreers Advice, etc.)\u2014a problem very relevant to I.C.C it p ant\u00bb <\u00a7ut fog( Engineering H>ot iet p Annual Btnntr\nTickets 30s. each\nfen\n7 for 7.30\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX January 28, 1971\nMORAL RE ARMAMENT\nThree short years at Imperial College and then we\nmust choose a job and set\noff into the outside world.\nThat is the programme for\nmost of us. But when one\nlooks at the world through\nthe newspapers or television\nit does not look very in vit ing. The world is in turmoil.\nWe, in Moral ReArmament, believe that if\nyou want to see the world\ndifferent the best place to\nstart is with yourself. Only\na reactionary wants to see\nthe world different without\nbeing different himself. Can\nAve protest against corrupt\npoliticians if we cheat in\nexams? Can we protest\nagainst aggressive nations if\nwe are aggressive people? I decided not; so I decided\nto try to live my life on the\nbasis of absolute moral\nstandards: honesty, purity,\nunselfishness and love. This\nmeant paying back money\nand putting things right with\nmany people including my\nparents.\nUnless we can deal\nradically and drastically\nwith human nature on a world scale we will change\nnothing. Rajmohan Gandhi,\ngrandson of Mahatma\nGandhi, put it this way:\n\"Could it be true that unless with God's help we war\nwith our natures, we are\ndestined to war with one\nanother\".\nIn Assam Nothing makes me more\nimpatient than people who\nair their fine theories without any grounding in fact\nand experience, so I hasten\nto add that I had seen a great deal of evidence of\nthe effectiveness of the\nideology of M.R. A. at work\nin the world before I decided\nto try it. In the past year\nthe most striking example, to\nmy mind, has been the remarkable settlement brought\nto Assam, the vulnerable\nstate of N.E. India. After\nunrest lasting sixteen years\namongst the hill-people of\nAssam, who wanted an\nautonomous state, a political\nsolution has been found. The\nnewspapers were predicting\na second Vietnam situation,\nbut in 1968 the General\nSecretary of the All-Party\nHill Leaders' Conference,\nStanley Nicholls-Roy visited\nPanchgani, an M.R. A. centre\nnear Bombay, with a delegation from the Assam Hills.\nHe said: \"My visit to Panchgani convinced me that\nM.R. A. is the ideology to\nbring sanity and peace to\nIndia's troubled- north-East\nand to help it play its rightful part in Asia and the\nworld\". In the next two\nyears Nicholls-Roy and\nAssam Chief Minister\nChaliha invited two large\nM.R. A. forces to Assam, including \"Anything to\nDeclare\" a musical review\nwhich started in Europe and\nhas toured Asia and\nENGINEERS& SCIENTISTS Cartoonists are lovely people but they' ve got it all wrong about Patent Examiners. As a Patent Examiner you won't find a row of peculiar people sitting outside\nyour office with their even more peculiar\ninventions. Though you do get the 1\n%\nnut cases, the other 99% of claimants\nare clever, well balanced \u2014mostly they\nare representatives of major companies\nor their Patent Agents, making genuine\napplications for a grant of a patent on\nall manner of systems and appliances.\nIt's a fascinating and, more often\nthan not, highly technical business. You\nmust study specifications and drawings,\nand discuss them with the claimants or\ntheir professional advisers. It's a job that\ndemands an incisive mind, quick to\nperceive the basic originality of an idea.\nAlmost always it calls for some kind of\nengineering or scientific knowledge.\nThat's why you should have, or expect to\nobtain, a1 st or 2nd class honours degree\nor an equivalent, such as Corporate\nMembership of I. Mech.E. or I. E.E. The salary scale for a Patent\nExaminer is \u00a31,287-\u00a32,828 (you could\nstart above the minimum). After about\n10 years, you should be promoted to\nSenior Examiner, where your salary rises\nto well over \u00a34,000. You enjoy more than\n4 weeks' holiday, and there's a generous\nnon-contributory pension,\nIf you are aged under 29 on\n31st December 1971, write or telephone\nfor an application form and to arrange\nto pay us a visit and see for yourself\nwhat a Patent Examiner does.\n(Application forms to be returned by\n1st March 1971.)\n1\nAustralasia. Chaliha later\nsaid: \"M.R. A. has transformed the climate of Assam.\nThat is a fact. I speak as an\nadministrator\". The result of\nthis transformation was the\nformation of a new autonomous state, Meghalaya,\nwhich was inaugurated by\nPrime Minister, Indira\nGandhi in April 1970. The\n\"Indian Express\" wrote:\n\"The birth of Meghalaya\n(Abode of the Clouds) seems\nto have generated a climate\nof good-will which few could\nhave believed possible even\na few months ago\".\nEffectiveness\nTo be an effective\nideological force requires\nmore than absolute standards\n\u2014 it requires strategy. I believe that the world is so\ncomplex that only one force\nis big enough and wise\nenough to fully understand\nit \u2014 God. The secret that\nmany have forgotten is that\nGod can speak to us.\nDefinite, accurate, adequate\ninformation can come from\nthe mind of God to the mind\nof man. To me it was a thrilling idea that God has a plan for each person, each\ncountry and the world. Many\npeople do not believe in God\nbut that does not prevent\nthem from taking a simple\ndecision to listen and to\nobey. If nothing comes they\nhave lost nothing. If God\nputs a thought into their\nminds they are launched.on\nan effective and revolutionary road which can dra st jc ally affect the course of his-tory. Whatever I do when I leave Imperial I want it to\nbe relevant to the needs of\nsociety.\nMr. C.U.P. Smith, The Patent Office,\n25 Southampton Buildings,\nLondon WC2A 1AY.

Gerrard, I. Harris,\nM. Hollings, P. Lonnen, R. Phillips, M. Whitman, and\nC.

Please pay\nin the full amount \u2014 if you\nhave difficulty collecting the\nmoney then come and see\nme with your walk form and\nif we can't collect the money\nfor you we will refund the\ndifference.\nWHY HAVE EXAMS?\nIntroduction Exams act as straightjackets on our education, like best\neggs we are selected and graded. Exams should not be ends\nin themselves, but a means of measuring certain previously\nagreed factors/teaching/learning aids. The aims of a course\nneed to be defined before its success can be ascertained.\nAims of a course\nVery few Departments state, or perhaps have even thought\nof the philosophy behind their courses. When they were\nasked to discuss with fresher s the ideas and philosophy of\nthe courses few did so, hence another group of students have\nembarked on a degree with little guidance or understanding.\nAlthough aims necessarily vary from department to depart-ment, it would seem reasonable that they should be to\ndevelop:\n1 The student's interest.\n2 An understanding of the subject and a theoretical basis\nso new problems can be thought through (critical\nawareness).\n3 A critical approach to 'conventional' wisdom.\n4 The relationship between a subject and related fields\nand society.\nMost of course, achieve just the opposite! Students are fed\non facts and expected to regurgitate them in three hours,\nonce a year, yet today facts are often soon outdated.\nThe present exam system Most defenders of the present standard examination would\ndefine their aims as testing achievement, providing a basis\nfor future selection, consolidating learning, providing feed-back, testing ability to stand up to stress.\nIf you look at these criteria few stand up to invest iga tion. Traditional exams have proved to be unreliable \u2022\n\u2014\ndifferent marks; the same examiner giving slightly different\nmarks to the same script at different times. Again we must\nask what this type of assessment is supposed to test, apart\nfrom memory and endurance \u2014 hardly understanding, rather\nconformity to a taught course perspective. What feedback\nis there when students never see their assessed papers?\nWastage (i.e. the guy who dropped out last year) is usually\na result of examination failure \u2014 is it really a learning\nfailure? \u2014 why not a staff or institution failure in the\nteaching, or in the course \u2014 why are all the flaws in the\nstudent, instead of the system. It has been shown that there is\nlittle relationship between performance now (i.e. the grade,\nor even possession of your degree) and performance in\nlater life. Many employers ask only that you graduate. A 'good' degree implies little except that you can stand a lot of strain and produce programmed information in the\nrequired order slightly better than your colleagues. It is\nlikely that exams cannot and do not test the qualities, either\nemployers or research institutes seek.\nAims of assessment\nAlthough it is the traditional exam which is mainly\nattacked above \u2014 there are many other forms of assessment\n\u2014 objective (!) tests, open book, oral, delayed time test,\ncontinuous assessment, dissertation \u2014 all with advantages\nand disadvantages. The prime consideration should be to\nfind the most appropriate assessment methods for particular\nstated aims \u2014 and this is for both staff and students to\nestablish. An important reason for retaining exams, from\nthe University point of view, is their function as a means\nof controlling students \u2014 exams are a constant threat overshadowing education.\nPossible reforms Ta\nMclooge\nthere should be automatic re-sits\neach student should be assessed by several examiners\n(including external markers) to maximise accuracy\nand impartiality.\nThe marking criteria should be publicised and (so\nstudents know just what the situation is \u2014 no mysteries\nand open to consideration by the students. Staff and\nStudents together should formulate the assessment\nsystem.\nBetter timing of exams.\nAll types of assessment should be investigated and\nused.\nBetter explanation of the existing appeal procedure,\nstudent is involved in a course in order to develop\nand express his understanding and assessment of himself\nand of his course. Just as staff and students should decide\nthe content of courses, so they should define the principles\nof their assessment.\nAs long as the examination system retains its strangle-hold, education will be a secondary consideration.\n4\n5\n6\nA "

For the first few\ndays change booths will be\nprovided at points convenient\nto the queues, to enable customers to obtain decimal\ncoins for amounts of less than\n1/- in \u00a3sd. Bar prices will\nbe reviewed and bottle rates\nwill be rounded to the\nnearest shilling.\nFrom 1st January 1971 refectory bills will be rounded\nto the nearest shilling; it will\nassist considerably if outstanding bills are paid in\n\u00a3sd before 15th February\n1971.\nThe Cash Office\nThe Cash Office will be\nclosed for three days (on\nMonday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 15th to 17th February), to reconcile the\nCollege accounts with the\nBank statements in \u00a3p.

One of the tasks of the\nPresident is to address the Society, and it is by way of introduction to this year's Presidential Address, \"Invention, Innovation and Design\" by Mr. G.B.R. Feilden, CBE, FRS\non Tuesday, 19th January (at 1315 in ME220), that this\narticle outlines Mr Feilden's distinguished career.\nBorn in 1917 and educated at Bedford School and King's College Cambridge, Mr Feilden graduated in 1939. After his\n\"graduate training\" with Lever Bros., he quickly became involved with the design, testing and manufacture of Whittle\nengines for Power Jets Ltd., during the War.\nAfter the War, he moved on to Rushton & Hornsby where\nhe set up the gas turbine department and published a number of papers on gas turbines.\nJust twenty years from graduation, he became a Director\nof Hawker Siddeley Industries Ltd., before moving to the\npost of Group Technical Director, Davy-Ashmore Ltd. in\n1961, where he was directly involved in a number of their\nsubsidiaries. The next stage in his career took him to the\nBritish Standards Institution, where he is now Director\nGeneral.\nThroughout his career, Mr. Feilden has had an interest\nin engineering design and this is demonstrated in the long list\nof engineering advisory and research committees of which he\nhas been, and still is a member. He became an FRS in 1959,\nand was Vice-President of the Royal Society from 1967-1969. He was awarded the CBE in 1966.\nHe says that one of his recreations is 'efficient' car repairs,\nwhich might imply that even at the top end of industry, an\nengineer is still a man who can wield a spanner!\nDINNER FOR EVERYONE Well, almost! While a student here at I.C. there are very\nfew opportunities to enjoy a reasonably inexpensive formal\ndinner with a group of friends or associates, and to hear a good after dinner speech. Yes, I know that there are Hall\nDinners every Tuesday, but there is no \"sense of occasion\"\nto them, and you don't get any speeches. There is also various Balls, but they are expensive.\nHowever, for those of us fortunate enough to be in City\nand Guilds, there is the Engineering Society Annual Dinner. Here is the golden opportunity to attend a good formal\n(well, lounge suits) but friendly dinner, which is also an excellent occasion to introduce your wife or girl friend (or vice\nversa) to your College and friends if you wish, and to meet\nsome members of staff informally. There will also be guests\nfrom various Engineering Institutions\u2014if you want to talk\nabout your chosen profession, from the Old Centralians\u2014if\nyou want to see what old students do with themselves, and\nfrom other Colleges' Engineering Societies\u2014if you want to\nsee how much better off we are here at I.C.! Even if you\njust want to sav our a Mooney Grade 1 and get quietly merry\non sherry, wine, port and beer afterwards then this is the\n\"happening\" for you.\nWe are still negotiating at great lengths with a certain\nwell known public figure to come to speak to us after the\ndinner, but we are assured of a good after-dinner speech.\nSo, you come on your own, or bring a friend, or lots of\nfriends. Tickets are available at 30 shillings each (new pence\nare not necessary as our D Day\u2014Dinner Day\u2014is on Wednesday, 10th. February), from any Committee Member. It\nwill probably be \"first come, first served\" so buy your\nticket (s) early, and come to enjoy yourself.\nAmnesty International Amnesty International came into existence as a result of\nan article in the Observer (London) in May 1961, which drew\nattention to the increasing number of people imprisoned\nsolely because of their opinions. The fact that Governments\nfrequently camouflaged their political motives by accusing\nthose arrested of criminal charges showed that they were\nsensitive to public opinion. An international campaign was\nproposed, not tied to any religious or political grouping, and\nready to act as rapidly as possible before the repressive position of governments hardened.\nAn office was established in London to assemble information about 'prisoners of conscience'; that is those physically prevented by imprisonment, from expressing their\nopinion, PROVIDED THEY DID NOT ADVOCATE\nVIOLENCE. Spies or persons working to overthrow their\nown government were excluded.\nThe statutes of AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL pledged\nto support all international movements supporting human\nrights. More directly, the movement would send investigators to establish if human rights were being violated and\nwould publicize infringements. In addition to group work\nthe movement would make representations to governments\nand international organizations and send lawyers and observers to trials.\nIn 1968 additions were made to the statutes; these being\ntwo other articles of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights and AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL states its\nobjects shall be to ensure for every person to freely hold\nand express his convictions and in pursuance of that object\nsecure throughout the world the observance of the provisions\nof Articles 5, 9, 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and irrespective of political considerations to\nwork for the release of and provide assistance to persons\nwho in violation of the aforesaid provisions, as to freedom\nof opinion, are detained, imprisoned restricted or otherwise\nsubjected to physical coercion by reason of their political,\nreligious or other conscientiously held belief or by any reason of their ethnic origin provided they have not used or\nadvocated violence.\nThe movement now consists of 21 National Sections, 700\ngroups and 1500 individual members. Each of these has a job to do in the AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL work. By\nbecoming a member, your subscription is used to bring some\nform of relief, be it food, clothes or money, to the families\nof these prisoners, for it is normally the breadwinner of the\nfamily who is imprisoned.\nBy joining a Group, you become one who helps to obtain\nthe release of the 'prisoner of conscience' entrusted to them.\nEach group adopts 3 prisoners selected for them by the International Secretariat with special attention to the need\nfor political balance. Groups use direct pressure by writing\nto Embassies and Ministries of the country involved and indirectly by enlisting the support of Trade Unions, professional associations and, when appropriate, the Press. The\nGroups also help with the moral welfare of the prisoner and\nhis family.\nMembers can also join the 'Postcard Campaign' which\nasks them to send three special cards each month each for\nan urgent case\u2014prisoners who may be under sentence of\ndeath. Cards are sent to authorities from members all over\nthe world, proof of the mounting weight of public opinion.\nFinally money is always needed. Prisoners can be re-leased. Their lives can be saved. Their families can be\ncared for\u2014but it costs money.\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL needs help. Could you\nhelp my forming a group in I.C.? Would you join the 'Post-card Campaign'?

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, 28th JANUARY, 1971 No. 296\nREFECTORIES SLIDE\nUsers of the Union Refectory will already have noticed\nthat the cafeteria service has been replaced by a buttery\nservice as from the start of this week. Similarly, staff members will have suddenly found that their eating facilities in\nSouthside have been radically altered. These changes' have\nhad to be made at very short notice in yet another attempt\nto prevent the Refectories making a disastrous loss this\ncoming session; changes which will hopefully achieve their\naim.\nIn the Union building, the popular cafeteria service has\nbeen replaced by an all-afternoon buttery service. It is\nhoped that this move will attract back to the Refectories,\nand to the Union in particular, the substantial number of\ncustomers which was lost by the 15% price rise last term.\nA suggestion to move Hall Dinners to College Block has,\nhowever, been dropped for the moment in face of strong\nopposition.\nThe Staff buttery and waitress services in the Senior Com\nmon Room in Southside have been combined into on%\ncafeteria type service, similar to the present student cafeteria,\nbut serving slightly better quality food at a correspondingly\nhigher price.\nAt the Rector's special Review of Refectories held on\nJanuary 11th, it was revealed that despite the 15% price\nincrease at the start of last term, the financial situation in\nthe Refectories continues to be critical. Takings for the first\ntwo months of last term were down by nearly \u00a33,000, and\non the present trends it was estimated that the Refectories\nwould make a loss of at least \u00a320,000. (Nearly as bad as the\n\u00a329,124 deficit last session).\nAs was reported in the last issue of FELIX, at the first\nRector's Review, held last term, nothing concrete was suggested to ease the financial crisis, and the general impression\nwas that another price rise was inevitable. However, over\nChristmas when the detailed accounts became known to the\nCatering Manager, it was realised that the last price increase\nhad been too much to be borne by many students and that\nmore and more were cooking for themselves or going out-side.\nAccordingly, Mr. Mooney came up with three basic suggestions, as the only sensible alternative to a price increase.\nIn the Union, replacement of the cafeteria service by a \"pie-and-c hippie\" would not only save \u00a36,000 on wages, but\nit would also fulfil the need for cheaper meals. The demand\nfor buttery meals has been demonstrated by the number of\ncustomers using the pie-and-chips section of the new Southside cafeteria, while at the same time the number using the\nCollege Block student buttery has not declined. It had been\nimagined that serving pie and chips in Southside would ease\nthe crush in College Block, but in fact it has demonstrated\nthe need for more buttery services around I.C. The new Union buttery is open from 11.00 a.m. through\nto 6.00 p.m. continuously, and is intended not only to serve\npie and chips, but also fish, dish of the day, salads, biscuits,\netc.\nHowever, since most of the staff have been transferred\nto College Block or to Southside, there is not now an adequate number of staff to deal with formal evening Dinners\nin the Dining Hall upstairs. On these occasions, extra staff\nwill have to be brought over from the College Block to a greater extent than previously, and this has led Mr. Mooney\nto suggest that Dinner in Hall every Tuesday night should\nbe transferred to College Block, where it would be slightly\neasier to prepare. However, strong and united opposition\nfrom all sides has led to the idea being shelved for this\nterm at least, and hopefully being dropped altogether.\nThe second of Mr. Mooney's suggestions at the Rector's meeting was that the prices of beer and spirits in the College\nbars should be increased by, say, 2d. per pint, to boost\nthe Refectory finances by about \u00a31,500 per year. Thirdly,\nhe suggested that the Southside SCR buttery service and the\nwaitress service dining room should be combined into one\ncafeteria. This would save approximately \u00a31,500 on wages,\nand should bring back those customers who had been driven\naway from the waitress service by the necessary increase in\nprice last term.\nBy these actions, said Mr. Mooney, the College could\nsave itself from quite such a large deficit, though he could\nnot possibly foresee the Refectories breaking even. He had\ndropped his earlier suggestion to close down the Union\nbuilding entirely (which would have saved nearly enough\nto make the other Refectories pay) because a complete\nclosure would not only have degraded the College facilities,\nbut would also have dealt a disastrous blow to the Union\nbar takings. Drastic action was, however, needed in the\nUnion, if the Refectory was to be made into a financially\nviable unit.\nThese suggestions having been pulled out of the hat in\nthis manner, the Union and the Senior Common Room\nrepresentatives were then given only four days in which to\nconsider the proposals and decide whether to accept them.\nDespite the short notice given, both bodies were able to\nhold discussions on the proposals, and both agreed that the\nchanges should go ahead.\nHowever, in the Union's reply to the proposals, President\nJudith Walker, while accepting the changes were necessary,\nand wishing the new buttery every success, nevertheless expressed the hope that these changes were not another stage\nin the run down of the Union building. This latter possibility has, in fact, been uppermost in the minds of very\nmany ICU officials, who are concerned that Dinners should\ncontinue to be a major activity in the Union building and\nthat the Union should not become more under-used than\nat present.\nSpirits Rise A considerable storm is brewing up over the\nproposed increased prices of beer and spirits in the\nCollege Bars, which are intended partially to sub-sid is e the ailing Refectories.\nThe recommended new prices, which have yet to be\napproved by the Refectory Committee, would be brought in\non February 15th, to coincide with decimalisation, for con-veni en ce. Draught beer would then cost 14p(2s.9.6 d.) in\nSouthside Bar, and 13p(2s.7.2 d.) in the Union bar; whisky,\ngin, vodka, etc., would be 15p(3s.) in either bar. A petition\nis being organised in R.S. M. protesting against these increases from the present prices of 2s.8d.,2s.6 d., and 2s.9d. respectively.\nAs reported elsewhere in FELIX, the price increases were\ndecided upon at the Rector's Review of Refectories and the\nRefectory Committee meeting at the start of term. The\nactual level of the increase was decided upon by the 5-man\nBar Committee.\nThe recommendations made at the Rector's Review were\nthat the prices of beer and other beverages should be increased (2d. per pint was mentioned) to bring in an extra \u00a31,500\nprofit to the Refectory system, to reduce the expected deficit\non catering services. It was also suggested by Catering\nManager Victor Mooney that although the College Accounts\nshowed the Bars made a profit last year of \u00a3926 on a turnover of \u00a355,965, in fact the Bars received services from the\nRefectory system for which they had not been charged, and\nwhich meant that they were running at a slight loss.\nProtests from students and other bar users have been\naimed at both of the above reasons for increasing the prices.\nMany regulars angrily ask why the bars should sub sid is e the Refectories, and maintain that increasing beer prices is\nonly an attempt to hide the bad state of the Refectories.\nAnger is also directed at the student members of the Refectory Committee, who did not oppose the suggestion of a subsidy.\nSeveral people have also expressed doubts at the cost of\nthe \"services\" received by the bars from the Refectories.\nHowever, FELIX, has not yet been able to find anybody\nin a position to seriously challenge Mr. Mooney's claims\nand/or produce alternative figures. The services in question\nwere listed by Mr. Mooney as the cost of looking after the\nbar accounts, stock takers' fees, cost of washing glasses and\ntowels by the Refectories, etc. Also the fact that the wages\nbill was low last year owing to the employment of casual\nlabour in the absence of enough full-time barmen. Mr.\nMooney estimates that these services came to over \u00a31,000\nlast year, which was not covered by the profit shown in the\naccounts. Moreover, wholesale beer prices were rising\nsteadily.\nIn addition to the arguments surrounding the principles\nof the price increases, concern has been expressed to FELIX\nby many Bar users at the level of the new prices. Although\nit was agreed at the Rector's meeting that the new prices\nshould be roughly half way between the present prices and\nthose outside, there are numerous complaints that this has\nnot been adhered to. However, in this context the word\n\"outside\" is very ambiguous, and it is not clear whether\n\"outside\" refers to pubs in the immediate neighbourhood, or\nin those areas where most I.C. students live. Regulars also\ncomplain that an increase in prices might reduce custom by\ndriving people outside the College.\nOverall, a considerable body of opinion is being mobilised\nagainst the proposed new price list, in marked contrast to\nthe last (un publicised) occasion, when 2d. was added to the\nprice of a pint without prior warning, and passed virtually\nun-noticed!!\nMike meets Maria WEDLOCK After a four year absence,\nMIKE (I.C's. giant working\nmicro-meter mascot) has\nbeen affixed to MARIA, the\nMascot Anti-Removal Indicating System. It is now on\ndisplay, on its plinth, in the\nUnion Lower Lounge. A brief review of Mike's troubled career would be In\norder. Many years ago, oh\nbest beloved, all the other\nLondon colleges got pissed\noff with I.C. pinching their\nmascots, whilst I.C. didn't have one. So I.C. made a mascot, a micrometer called\nMike. It was designed in\nR.C.S., cast in Mines, and\nmachined in Guilds, and\nhence created. (For the\np seu ds Mike is a symbolic\nrepresentation of the collective ness of the constituent\ncolleges, three in one, as\nI.C.). Alarms were (and still\nare) necessary to protect it,\nand Maria was not complete\nwhen Mike was first ordered\n(by I.C.U. exec.) to be put\non its plinth. U.C. promptly\ncame along and cut Mike\nout with oxy-acetylene cut-ter s, and took it away. It\nwas later rescued from a lump of ferro-concrete that\nU.C. had placed it in. That\nwas four years ago. Since\nthen it has been pinched by\nKings Medics and some\nidiots in Mines, but has\nnever been seen on its plinth.\nMaria is now complete, and\nany attempts to remove\nMike will result in lots of\nalarms going off and waking\neveryone up, and they'll\npromptly rush into the\nUnion to stop the theft of\nMike!\nThe door on the plinth is\nheld in place by three ASSA\nlocks in conjunction with an\nelectronic combination s ys tem. The clamp is unaffected\nby filing or sawing (but this\nwould set off the alarms);\noxy-acetylene and the r mic lances will find the going\ntough; liquid helium might\ndo the trick.\nOne last word:\u2014 Mike\nand Maria are looked after\nby the Wooden Horse Organisation (WHO) who also\nco-ordinate mascot-pinching\nraids.

It appears\nthat no matter what policy is applied, the refectories cannot\nbut lose almost \u00a320,000 every year. It's a vicious circle that\nis universally applicable \u2014 if prices rise their sales inevitably\ndrop and turnover cannot be improved.\nHowever this college is not a good proof of the theory.\nThis part of London is an expensive and fairly highbrow one.\nUnlike those colleges situated elsewhere in Greater London\nthere are no local popular inexpensive cafes which can compete with college refectories. Mr. Mooney realises this and\ncan thus feel confident that his price rises will be effective.\nTodays news is nevertheless a warning that increased prices\ncannot indefinitely be met.\nThe idea, first suggested by Harry Fairbrother, of a scheme to try and help depressed students in a similar manner to the Samaritans, is a good one. It seems that at last\npeople have admitted that I.C. does have some tremendous\nfaults, some of which can lead perfectly normal people into\ndeep depression.\nThe scheme's intention of course is to prevent suicides,\nthe most ironic form of death. What I.C. now also needs is\nsome sort of organisation to probe why young people should\nwant to take their own lives. It's a long complex and environmental question which cannot simply be answered by\none person. What answers are discovered should be quickly\napplied to our college, the sooner the better.\nSummer Jobs We have been sent copies of two books published by an organisation known as Vacation-Work of Oxford. The \"Directory of\nSummer Jobs in Britain\" claims to include 30,000 vacancies for jobs\nto occupy your idle summer months. Of these, about 20,000 appear\nto be hotel jobs such as chambermaids (\u00a36 a week), dishwashers\n(\u00a312 a week), etc. Farmworkers and fruit pickers also appear to\nbe in demand. Some voluntary and social jobs are included. Assuming that all the jobs will not be gone by the time you get round\nto buying the book, it seems a reasonably Good Thing, although it\ncosts 14 bob (would you bei lie ve70p?) Very similar in appearance but wider in scope is The Directory\nof Summer Jobs Abroad, which, by a coincidence, also contains\n30,000 vacancies. A wide selection of countries is featured including\nAndorra, (Waiters and Hall Porters) and Ghana, (Voluntary Workcamps). The book also contains details of Visas, Work Permits and\nthat stuff, together with some cheap travel facilities; all for 14\nshillings. It does not include anything about the U.S.A. Apparently\nthere is another book available, costing 39 shillings, with 80,000\nentries at wages up to \u00a3100 per week, in all parts of the U.S.A., but\nthey did not send us one of these, so I'm not going to mention it.\nGet your copy from your friendly neighbourhood bookshop \u2014\nthe 1971 edition was published on January 18th.

Publication Board, Imperial College Union, London,\nS.W.7. LETTERS\nFilm Critics Dear, Sir,\nWith reference to the showing of the Carnival Film\n\"Ulysses\", I must protest about the standard of behavior\nof certain members of the audience. As the film was being\nshown, there was a continuous bar racking of crude puerile\nhumour and paper darts. This sort of \"criticism\" was never\ndeserved by the film and constitutes a serious breach of individual liberties and rights. It is well known that \"Ulysses\",\nboth film and book, is a difficult work of art to under-stand, and so it must be asked why did certain anti-social\nmembers of I.C. attend for the sole purpose of destroying\nthe enjoyment of the majority of the people?\nI have noticed that Film Soc has also been plagued by\nsimilar audiences so that films of artistic quality can no\nlonger be satisfactorily viewed. I feel that the complete lack\nof appreciation of the Arts in Imperial College is a tragedy\nand I hope that everybody will agree with me in condemning\nthese infantile disruptions.\nYours sincerely,\nPeter Lewis.\nDear, Sir,\nI should like to add some comments about \"the complete lack of appreciation of the arts\" which Peter Lewis\nobserves in Imperial College. I don't think that audience reaction at the Film Society is anything like as bad as he\nimplies. There is a natural ambivalence towards foreign films,\nand the consequent subtitles, which is due to unfamiliarity\nand conditioning by unimaginative major distribution policies\nwhich almost totally exclude the foreign language film from\nthe commercial circuits. The committee of the Film Society\nis anxious to overcome this by mixed programming \u2014 a variety of the \"art-house\" and better commercial releases \u2014\nand I think that this policy has been largely successful over\nthe past two years. For instance last year \"Elvira Madigan\"\nand \"Closely Observed Trains\" were enthusiastically received,\nand this season, after perhaps initial scepticism towards the\nunknown, \"Capricious Summer\", \"Stolen Kisses\" and \"The\nTruce\" were very popular. There is a danger of becoming\nso keen on \"artistic quality\", a term which applies to many\npopular English-language commercial films as well as to\nforeign-language films, entertaining or not, that such vital\nfactors as print quality and sound synchronisation are ignored.\nThese can turn scepticism and minor irritation into restlessness and antipathy, and quite justifiably so.\nWith regard to \"Ulysses\" in particular (which the Film\nSociety arranged to screen on behalf of Carnival), I should\nstress that this film was thought by Dennis Taylor and myself to be that capable of raising the maximum funds for\nCarnival. There was quite a fuss when it was first released,\nand \"Ulysses\" achieved an undeserved notoriety, which I think we were justified in cashing in on for the sake of a worthy cause, so there was presumably a faction of the\naudience for whom the film didn't live up (or down) to their\npreconceptions.\nIt is a pity if \"bar racking of crude puerile humour and\npaper darts\" is not confined to the films shown by H.G. Wells Society apparently to satisfy this basic need (as well as\nto raise money). Most of the \"load-of-old-corn\" films shown\nby them, which presumably do not fall into Peter Lewis'\ncategory of \"artistic quality\" would indeed be deadly dull\nif it were not for the audience exposing every ambiguity in\nthe dialogue \u2014 the vast majority of the audience encourages\n\"infantile disruptions\" which are an absolutely Vital ingredient of the shows.\nHowever I agree with Peter Lewis in deploring any\naudience behaviour which detracts from the enjoyment of\nothers.\nJohn Ackers\n(Chairman, Film Society).\nJUDITH\nGRANTS As a result of NUS pressure the government has agreed\nto a major grants review in September 1971. (Details in Sennet and later Felices). In order that the negotiations be really\nsuccessful, students (i.e. we!) will have to campaign \u2014 to\ndraw attention to grant inadequacies; to influence public\nopinion by publicity; to win support from other groups; to\ninfluence government, local authorities, parliament. Legislature changes as well as more money are required because\nworse off than us are the students e.g. HND, HNC, whose\ngrants depend on the whims of their local authorities. Since\nthere are few sanctions students can apply we have to win\nsupport.\nOur standard of living has been substantially cutback\nin recent years and inflation has hit harder. The Rectors refectory meeting realised that the prices could not increase \u2014\nwe had no more money.\nICU Will have to plan its own strategy and USK action is\nalso called for. One suggestion has been to write to local\npapers (Sth. Ken. and your own town) and perhaps publicise\nhardship cases \u2014 so although this might sound sensational is tic if there's anyone who has very bad grants difficulties come\nand tell us. We will have to mobil is e effectively \u2014 this campaign affects us all.\nCOMPUTING With the establishment of a Dept. of Computing and\nControl has been suggested another set of college committees\n(yi pee!). One, the computing policy committee consisting of\n6 profs and the Rector, will plan the development of computing at IC \u2014 finance, facilities etc. Whereas the computing\nservices committee, subordinate to the first but still dominated\nby professors (9/11) will deal with more mundane matters\n\u2014 quality of service, publicity, co-ordinating de pts teaching\nand research requirements. These proposals were drafted by\n'senior personnel' and there was little consultation with others\nlikely to be affected. The Board of Studies was then presented with the complete plan \u2014 the usual case with BoSt\nbusiness.\nThe assumption has again been made that only professors are capable of directing services and ascertaining the\ncollege's needs, although we have successfully challenged\nthis 'right' many times (e.g. BoSt itself). Students as major\nusers for teaching and research purposes should be involved\nin deciding computing priorities and development. A system\nof representation is being worked out so pass on any comments through your dept reps.\nSELKIRK WARDEN Due to Mr. Seaford's resignation (only from his warden-ship!), the machine is now geared to 'evolving' a new war-den.\nIt would seem only logical that students should participate in a proper selection procedure. Wardens are obviously\nclosely involved with students' lives. Only because urgent\nrepresentations were made to the Rector for student involvement have we been consulted \u2014 not on the choice as yet,\nbut the procedure. It has been suggested that the next appointment be made for a5 year term only, however the\nactual selection procedure we will have to discuss.\nHalls have begun to break out of their traditional\nstraightjacket. Residents, through hall committees and the\nUnion can now make decisions instead of being dictated to\nby wardens. With this development the role of a warden has\nchanged \u2014 he should now be more an advisor than guardian.\nThe next warden we must ensure to be of this new breed.\nUnion Meeting next Thursday, 28 January \u2014 grants.\nI.C. Television Dear All,\nContrary to rumours spread about by our publicity\nSTOIC is alive and well and living in Elec. Eng. 306. The\nstudio is almost completed and we can now start making\nprogrammes again. If you've got any ideas or would just like\nto help \u2014 camera pushing or in front of tele camera appearing\nor anything \u2014 get in touch with us via the Union Rack.\nAs it doesn't look like we shall be getting our line to\nCollege Block installed in the near future we shall be making\nprogrammes for stock-pile and showing when ICTV gets\nunderway in 1972 and for our own use from next year \u2014\ni.e. September 71.\nWe also want some very good folk/Jazz/Blues musicians\nto help us put together some Light Entertainment programmes so if you are bent that way let us know.\nThere will also be meetings with TV producers and such\npeople so that we can pick their brains about the right way\nof doing things.\nStill, I must go and make programmes.\nYours visually,\nSTOIC\nWRITE/DRAW FOR THE NEW STATESMAN.\nSee current issue for details of Student Journalists\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 ~\nNEW STATESMAN\nPolitics, books, the arts.

The idea, brilliant, revolutionary and mind-bending though it is, is not original and was first used by\nTed Heath not so long ago when he conned a majority\nin the House of Commons.\nDo you want to see,\n1. Emerson, Lake and Palmer in the Great Hall?\n2. Stones revival concert at the Royal Albert Hall?\n3. Monty Python live at I.C.?!!!4. Arts Festival with poetry/music/films and plays?\n5. AH leo ture s cancelled for a week?!!!\n6. Judith's underwear?\nObviously you want all of these things and would pity\nanybody who tried to organize (or get) them. The above\nevents would take a cool \u00a35,000, and \u00a32,000 for the last\ntwo. Carnival week doesn't have any big-name concerts or\n\"non-return\" events. After discarding the original idea of\nhaving a conventional rag week a fun dedicated intelligentsia,\nafter hours of painstaking market research using an IBM\n7094 computer and Aristo 12in. slide rule, came up with the\nbrilliant idea of setting aside a particular week in this term\nto collect as much money as possible with the least organization and expenditure. Carnival Week is the result, I.C.'s answer to the Coronation, Eisteddfoddddd and Neasdon\nParish Hall Fete.\nThe total expenditure for the week is about \u00a3100, (except\nfor I.C. Ents do and R.C.S. Carnival\u2014which are events in\nthemselves). We hope to realise \u00a32,000. That may sound\nunrealistic but if EVERY year in each dept. does its bit,\norganizing a collection during this week, we*ll not only break\nall previous records by the end of the year but will help\nthe Westminster Council of Social Services to:\n(a) Build an adventure playground,\n(b) Provide a Citizens' Advice Bureau,\n(c) Provide transport/outings/re or eat ional facilities for\npeople who are living under hardship.\nSo you don't agree with Charity and the way it is collected.\nWELL IT IS NEEDED (take a short tube journey to\nPaddington and see).

WHAT'S HAPPENING?\nCollections: AH you need to do when you've thought of\na way of dragging your year out is to see one of the know-GENERAL STS Originally this was to be an attempt to inform the apathetic masses about General studies lectures, but recently 1\nhave found myself squashed into the corners of crowded\nlecture theatres, so I will concentrate on pointing out w hal is happening Tuesday/Thursday lunchtimes this term. Mainstays of the programme are series of talks by Patrick Carpenter (art), Patric Dickinson (poetry), and Frank Lea\n(philosophy), plus one-day stands by, inter alia, Trevor\nHuddleston (reh gion), Robert Thorne (architecture), and\nDerek Wright (sex).\nIf you are fired with enthusiasm on reading this (don't turn over the page until the lecturer turns to the blackboard)\nyou will be just in time to catch the third of Patrick Carpenter's \"Art and Science\" series. Mr. Carpenter has been visiting Physios Lecture Theatre for several years, and has built\nup quite a following\u2014arrive early for the best seats.\nPatric Dickinson, poet and playwright, has chalked up\nquite a tally of books and broadcasts since the war, and\nintends in his talks to deal with poetry in four categories,\ntitled T.S. Ehot/Childrens/John Betjeman/Underground. For\ndeep thinkers, Frank Lea, of Elec Eng, will this year deal\nwith the thoughts of the British philosophers.\nIf, like myself, you wish you could understand Classical\nMusic, I can recommend the last of the series by Denis\nMatthews and Brenda McDermott, to be given next Tuesday. Mr. Matthews punctuates his extracts from four-hand\npiano works with lucid technical explanations and anecdotes,\nmaking up a very listenable whole. Other musical items are\na Question Period with Colin Davis, we l known as conductor of the \"Proms\", and now musical director of Covemt\nGarden Opera, plus a two-part talk on \"Tristan and Isolde\"\nby the amazing Else Mayer-Lismann (and her piano).\nOn a critical note, I know that MechE 342 is the only\nlecture-theatre with a piano, or vice versa, but it is very\nsubject to extraneous noises off from the heating system,\nfalling scaffolding, etc. which must distract both performers\nand audience.

Interviewing the offender afterwards revealed\nthat the facts were incorrect \u2014 the punch having\nmissed! City provided reasonable opposition to a slightly unfit I.C. team returning after a festive\nChristmas vac. \u2014 several of\nthe team 'flaking' rather\nnoticeably towards the end\nof the game, (especially\nthose in positions of authority?). The points were\nscored from tries by Adams\nand Harrison (via the post),\none of which was converted\nby full back Pudney. He\nalso kicked a penalty after\nAlan James had dropped a fine goal.\nWith the recent crisis in\nthe club over a change in\ncaptaincy a few changes\nwere made for the game\nagainst South Bank Polytechnic. Unfortunately, the\nopposition were too weak to\nenable effective study of\ncertain players except perhaps a too familiar figure\nin the S.B. front row! The\nscorers are too numerous to\nmention individually but\neven both props trundled\nover from some of James'\n'fair-like' breaks! An injury to No. 8 Icely may keep\nhim out of the next cup\ngame to be played against\nRoyal Free Hospital on\nWed. 27 January.\nAt this stage of the season the record against college sides is quite imposing\n\u2014 only one out of 11 games\nbeing lost, 284 pts scored for\nthe club and 37 pts against.\nA pity the Saturday record\nagainst club sides is not so\nimpressive.\nI.C. Hockey shows\ngood form\nM1\nAre you interested in\nbooks by:\u2014\nJoseph jj eller Edward ^Ibee\nJohn Le Carre\nRonald Qahl\nJohn Arden Harold Nicholson\nGavin gwar t Get them from the\nHaldane Library Level 2, Library Block\nOpen Mon. to Fri. 10\u20145.30\nIC 1st XII. C. got off to a good\nstart, scoring two goals in\nfive minutes. After this they\nnever looked like conceding\na goal, but scored at regular\nintervals. The standard of\nplay was fairly high and\nI.C. looked strong on all\nparts of the field, especially\non the wings. As for the de-fence, I.C. have only conceded 4 goals against Colleges this season which\nspeaks for itself.\nIC6,U C0 In the first game of the\nterm, an unfit I.C. team\nmanaged to pulver is e U.C.I. C. were far superior in all\nparts of the game and a mention must be given to\nRon Palmer and Mark\nTatchell, who played extremely well.\nIC 1, Burnt Ash1 This game again proved\nthat club sides are a great\ndeal stronger than college\nopposition, but I.C. stuck\nto their job well, and although conceding a goal\nten minutes from time, managed to equalise through\nright-half Alistair Forbes.\nDinghy EDITORIAL\non Ice\nAsk any layman and he\nwould undoubtedly be of\nthe opinion that the dinghy\nsailor was a hibernating animal who ventured out onto\nthe water in late spring but\nspent the winter in the boat-house with a lot of wet var-nish. Not so the Imperial\nCollege breed. It'll take\nmore than a touch of frost\nto stop him and the possibility of a swim in the icy\nwaters merely 'adds to the\nfun' and definitely sharpens\nup the concentration. Of\ncourse, the occasional passing iceberg provides an excellent means of stopping\nthe opposition and nobody\nwould argue that you can't tell where the wind's coming from in a raging b liz zard! You may think that\nthere are less energetic ways\nof getting a cold shower but\nhanging over the side of one\nof these hairy dinghy machines is certainly tops for ex-cite ment. As in past years, the standard of performance among\nl.C. helms is extremely high\nand with five out of six in\nthe U.L.1 st team regularly\ncoming from their ranks,\nthis is no idle boast. I.C. sailors recently figured well\nin the first round of the British Universities Trials for\na team to tour the States in\nthe summer and three out\nof the ten qualifiers viz\nNick Martin, Pete Claydon\nand Alan Curran were from\nthe home club. There's no\ndoubt that reservoir sailing,\neven in a place like NEASDEN in the middle of win-The first few weeks back at I.C. have been hard and\ntort u rous ones for the sports people. The mental and physical (more visual!) effects of the festive Christmas vac. had\nto be eliminated by the old traditional methods involving\nmuch sweat and tears before the advent of the impending\ncup games for many clubs. This of course is not true for\nthose who enjoyed the benefits of a winter skiing holiday\n\u2014 as many I.C. sports people seem to have done.\nOne section of the sporting community were certainly\nnot idle over the vac. This was the girls who represented\nthe U.L. womens hockey side who played in a very high\nstandard 5-day tournament at Eastbourne, U.L. being the\nonly non-county side participating. These sporting festivals\nmight be rather good ideas for many clubs who find they\nhaven't enough money to stage an extensive tour this year\n\u2014 certainly playing and social standards prove very de-manding!\nLooking ahead somewhat, we turn to what may become\na very controversial subject \u2014 I.C. Sports Day. This is held\nat Motspur Park when the 3 colleges compete against each\nother for the President's Cup. Over the years one has noticed\nthe decline in popularity of this important event in the sporting calendar of the college. Last year's seems to have been\nrather poorly organised and some people are asking for a change of venue to Harlington and a change of day to\nWednesday. Various problems arise here since the standard\nof the athletics will obviously suffer on a non-cinder track\nand also that Motspur would be unavailable on a Wednesday. Let us hope that A.C.C. will be able to settle the problem satisfactorily.\nAs various club captains try to whip up enthusiasm\nfor their forthcoming cup games, a recent event must be\nmentioned which caused enormous concern in one particularly vociferous section of I.C. It finally culminated in over\n50 people hiring a coach for a weekend to Cardiff \u2014 the\nofficial reason being given as the annual Wales v England\ngame in the Home Counties rugby union championship.\nNeedless to add Wales won yet again but even the English\nmembers of the party weren't grumbling by 10 o 'clock on\nSaturday night! What this has to do with I.C. sport is not\nimmediately clear but when one looks at the lack of articles\non Sports Page this week the glimmerings of an answer\nappear.\nter, attracts a good deal of\ntop class competition.\nWith the possibility of\nwarmer weather just around\nthe corner, one begins to\nthink of offshore cruising\nand what better way of getting away from work and\nthe polluted London atmosphere than to take a trip on\nboard the college cruiser.\nYou'll find a weekend pulling on ropes and breathing\nsalty Solent air will make\na pint of beer taste pretty\ncoo d. Clean Sweep for\nSoccer Club\nl.C. entertained Kent\nUniversity on Wed. 20 January, in a block fixture for\nthe first four teams. The\ngames were delayed till 4.0\np.m. due to Kent's late ar-rival.\nThe 1st XI played some\nvery good football. They\nwere obviously a much superior side to the Kent l st XI. I.C went ahead in the\nfirst half through Darley\nwho scored a very neat goal\nfrom fullback Paul Worthington's corner. In the 2nd half I.C. let midfield slip\nand were put under pre s sure, Kent's equal ising goal\nhowever came from a mistake by goalkeeper Bakewell, he stubbed his toe and\npresented the Kent centre-forward with an easy goal.\nThe 2nd team had no\ntrouble, they trounced their\nKent counterparts 7-0, with\nTony Richards playing a dominant part in the goal\nscoring. The 2nds defence\nlooked very much in command with old timers Widelski and Mcardle proving\ntoo experienced for the\nKent forwards.\nThe 3rds had a more\nstrenuous game, only just\nwinning by 2-1.\nThe 4th s also won by the\nconvincing score of 7-3, the\nKent goals only came after\nI.C. were reduced to 9 men,\nM. Hannan was booted on\nthe nose and had to leave\nthe field and Kevin Eustace\nvery sporting ly left the field\nbefore the end in order to\ncatch the first coach.\nP19 Won\n14\nDrawn Lost\n2 3\nFor Against\n49 12\nALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPORTS PAGE FOR NEXT ISSUE INTO FALMOUTH248 BY3rd FEBRUARY.
