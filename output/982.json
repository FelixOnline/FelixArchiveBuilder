As the play ended on\nNovember 28th, it did not give those 'with some\ninterest in the subject matter' much time to see\nit, especially observant Jews such as myself who\nare unable to attend the theatre Friday\nafternoons and Saturdays.\nAdrian Thurston the reviewer accuses 'the\neternal Jewish intellectuals' of hijacking the\nholocaust, which was, he informs us, 'the\npersecution of political prisoners, criminals and\ngays'.\nI have never heard of any Jew deny that\ncommunists, gypsies, homosexuals and others\nwere persecuted in the holocaust. Martin\nSherman, the author of this play, focusing in on\npersecution of homosexuals, is himself Jewish.\nMaintaining that the 'butt of Nazi hate was\nnot the Jews', and that there were 'certain\nprivileges and luxuries only allowed to Jews', is\nthe sort of revisionism practiced by 'historians'\nsuch as Irving, who is rumoured to have once\nsaid that \"the holocaust never happened, and it's a shame Hitler didn't finish the bloody yi ds off.\nI have never heard of any concentration\ncamp survivor talk about the luxuries of the\ncamps, nor have I read any account, first hand\nor otherwise that described the death camps in\nthose terms.\nNow the only reason any Jew has in stopping\nthe world from forgetting that the Holocaust\nhappened is to prevent are occur en ce; something which does not seem so unlikely\nwhen observing the anti-Turk activity in\nGermany, and the disgraceful treatment of\nBosnian Moslems in former Yugoslavia.\nIf people submit offensive and ignorant racist\narticles, which you feel are worthy of\npublication, could you please print them in a separate column, as I would rather skip them out\nand just read the normally excellent reviews.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Factor, Materials IV.\nIt's The Pits!\nDear Felix,\nThe Editors of PIT would like to express\ntheir support for Beccy, at a time when many\npeople are signing petitions condemning her.\nWhilst Felix has been tediously boring this year,\npeople should remember that Beccy is the\nEditor not the writer.\nIf you want an interesting read start\nsubmitting interesting articles or shove it up\nyour pode hole (sic).\nLots of love,\nEd and Gareth.\nP.S. PIT Christmas Special out two weeks\ntoday (3rd December).\nDear Beccy,\nI have never been particularly good friends\nwith the Union lift. It never invited me to any of\nits birthday parties, and always refused to buy a round in Da Vinci's. But it's gone too far this\ntime. I'm not sure what I 've said to it, but it has\na distinct grudge against me. Two weeks ago, it\npretended it had amnesia, and couldn't remember which floor was which. The only one\nit could get right was the ground floor, where I always get in anyway. I don't really like walking\nup three flights of stairs to STOIC from the first\nfloor, especially when I know the lift is quietly\nfollowing me up, laughing to itself in the safety\nof its shaft.\nThis in itself was not too bad, until I found\nthe lift had a real grudge against me. Three times\nin the last two weeks, it has found it necessary to\ndo my bidding and take me down to the ground\nfloor, but then to refuse to open the doors. I wasn't too pleased, as you may imagine. No\namount of cajoling, stroking, hitting random\nbuttons, breaking down in tears, and many other\ntricks of the lift user's trade would budge the\ndoors. So I tried something I'd never done\nbefore whilst sober. I pressed the alarm button.\nSome hope. Five minutes later I was still inside,\nbecoming seriously late for my tutorial or\nsomething. Then, out of the blue, our user-Dear Beccy,\nIt is estimated that at least 40 million people\nwill be affected by Aids at the end of this\ncentury. Aids effects everyone, so it's important\nthat we mark World Aids Day. This year we had\nstalls, a fire eater, benefit disco and article in\nFelix.\nOn behalf of ourselves and Paula Collens we\nwould like to thank everyone who helped during\nthe day to organise the events: Ian and all the\nbar staff for their hard work and support and for\ndonating the barrel of beer; Yvonne and the\ncatering staff for their help and donating 5p from every drink sold in Da Vinci's; the Union\nstaff, especially Michelle, Ali, Sam and Charlie\nfor manning the stalls; the Fire Eater for\nfreezing in Beit Quad; the Ents kiddies for the\nbenefit gig; and last but not least each student\nwho wore their red ribbon and contributed to the\nday.\nWith your help we're sending a large\ndonation to the Terrence Higgins Trust to help\nin the battle against Aids.\nThanks to everyone.\nWe love you all!\nNicky Fox, ICU Welfare Officer.\nMin Kavlak, Union Adviser.\nfriendly (not) lift decided to wring some blood\nout of its heart of stone. It deposited me on the\nfirst floor, leaving me to walk down the last\nflight of stairs. But when I reached the bottom,\neven more of a surprise met my eyes. Security\nofficers peering into the lift doors, Union staff\nshouting in to find the person who rang the\nalarm, firemen with cutting gear forcing the\ndoors open...You'd never have noticed they\nwere missing. Nothing there. Not a sausage. I'm not counting the chuckling coming from the\nshaft as the lift shot up to the top floor for its\nnext victim.\nSurely someone must have noticed the alarm\nbeing raised...Surely someone in the Union\nOffice must have taken some notice of me when\nI told them the lift had trapped me each time it\nhappened. Surely something should be done\nabout it?? Mind you it did take them two weeks\nto mend the door so it could tell when it was\nabout to rip your arm off as it closed and went\nup. Will it take a death, from arm-rip off it is or\nclaustrophobic s trapped in there for days on end\nwithout food, water or clean undies?? Or will\nsomeone finally take notice of this lift trying to\ntell people how ill it is and how it needs early\nretirement so badly??\nBryan Crotaz, EE2.\nA fire eater outside the Union Building marking\nWorld Aids Day last Wednesday.\nPhoto: Simon Govier\nAids Day - A Success for ICU\nThe deadline for letters is 6pm on Monday\n\n"

    "content": "10 Clubs and Societies\nImperial College Alumni Association Malaysia\nCelebration Dinner for the participants of the Hibiscus Evening 1993 held by the Malaysian Society\nCurrently the second largest overseas student\ngroup, Malaysian students have had a long\nhistory with Imperial College, perhaps for more\nthan half a century. A rough estimate will put the\nnumber of graduates from this institution at\nbetween 600 and 1200. Trends show that the\nfigure will rise in the years to come.\nDegree courses in the British universities are\ntraditionally renowned for their depth and\nrig our, so much so in the case of Imperial\nCollege. Obtaining a degree from this prestigious university is just a beginning. The\ngraduates of Imperial College will bear a similar\noutlook and share common identities. They will\nappreciate the values, friendship, environment\nand educational training they received.\nOver the years, Malaysian Imperial College\ngraduates have been striving to set up an alumni\nassociation. Their efforts have seen a measure of\nsuccess with the formation of the Imperial\nCollege Alumni Association Malaysia (ICAAM)\nand its pro-tem board, headed by Datuk F.S. Lau.\nThe advantages of having an alumni are\nmulti-fold. The most fundamental and important\nof all is that it helps to strengthen the\nrelationship amongst graduates. By organising\nevents like reunions, graduation ceremonies and\ndinners, as well as the publication of regular\nmagazines, ICA AM will be able to overcome the\ngeographical distances and provide an effective\nlinkage. It will also foster the exchange of ideas\nand information among the members.\nIn addition, ICA AM can assist the graduate\nin job-seeking, or by providing discretionary\ngrants and employment advice though their\nvarious trusts and wide ranging contacts within\nindustry. More routinely, ICA AM will provide\ninformation and assist any potential students\nwho are intending to study in Imperial College.\nWorking in parallel withe the Malaysian\nSociety, orientation days and talks could be held.\nAlso, as a learned society, it will inevitably\ncontribute towards the achievement of\nexcellence in the profession though the activity\nof its membership. Indeed, it will find itself\nconcerned with issues that have a direct bearing\nor consequence on the professional community\nas a whole.\nThe benefits of the alumni are not restricted\nto its member alone. Imperial College will also\nsee the fruit as they will be gaining valuable\nrecognition in the eyes of the Malaysian public,\nthereby increasing the number of potential\nstudents (for example, two current Government\nMinisters of Singapore were from Imperial\nCollege).\nIn this country, the Government support for\nhigher education has been on the decline.\nCoupled by the tight spending brought by the\ncurrent downturn in economy and the ever\nfiercer competition among the universities for\nstudents and staff, many universities have been\nled to re-assert the worthiness of their old boys.\nFor instance, the 1992 Annual Fund,\nmanaged by the Imperial College Trust,\nmanaged to raise \u00a398,000 for the College. This\ngoes to show that the alumni can play an\nimportant role in helping the Alma Matar\nachieve its goals.\nImperial College has long been a beacon for\nadvanced study to the Malaysian students. As in\nmany parts of the world, an Imperial College\ndegree commands a great deal of respect; the\ngraduates find themselves identified with the\nrespected community within the larger fabric the\nsociety.\nWe believe that the trip of the Rector, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh, to the Far East this week,\naiming primarily at strengthening the alumni\nrelations in the region, augurs well for the\ninception of ICA AM, which is awaiting the\napproval from the Registrar of Organisations in\nMalaysia.\nThe Imperial College Malaysian Society will be\nholding an Annual General Meeting on 'The\nInauguration of the ICAAM Subcommittee' at\n2pm, LT 220 Mech. Eng., on Wednesday 8th December 1993\nRock Around The Clock\nAnyone near the walkway at 6pm on Saturday\nwas in for a shock - forty unkempt, wild-eyed\nfigures lurched out of the JCR and vanished into\nthe night. Was Michael Jackson re-shooting the\nThriller video in Imperial College? Or perhaps\nthe Imperial College Voodoo Club was having\nits first meeting! (...And are they RCC or SCC?)\nThese zombie-like figures were actually the\nsurvivors of a24 hour sponsored dance in aid of\nthe BBC's Children In Need Appeal. Last year\nthe Dance Club raised over \u00a3900 for the Sesame\nInstitute; this year we have returned to our usual\ncharity and hope to beat that total.\nIt all started very quietly at 6pm on Friday\nwith a dozen of the die-hard s who would dance\nfor all 24 hours. By8 pm( elegantly late as\nusual), we were up to about 30 and were soon\njoined by contingents from Cambridge and UL U clubs. We had thrown the event open to all;\nsome danced for a few hours, others much more.\nWe'd kidnapped the Cambridge minibus in the\ncar park, so they stayed until the end.\nWe had hoped to put on a series of workshops to break up the hours. Unfortunately, the\n'flu had decimated our trainers. Instead, we\nresorted to silliness. At 3am, we started a Disney\nhour, with highlights from The Jungle Book,\nThe Little Mermaid and Aladdin (Prince Ali is a quickstep). In exchange for showing us some\nold-time dancing, we taught Cambridge some\n1920s Lindy Hop and the Stroll (a close approximation to dancing whilst asleep).\nThe survivors of the graveyard shift of\n4.10am were joined by the Dance Team for their\nregular Saturday morning practice. Under strict\norders not to show off their routines in front of\nCambridge, they still managed to look horrify-ingly energetic (at least those who hadn't been\nup all night).\nBy mid-afternoon, we were being re-joined\nby those who had danced until the early hours,\nthen retired to bed. There were over 40 of us for\nthe final dance...not the Last Waltz, but Rock\nAround The Clock. (Yes, it's corny, but we\ncouldn't find a copy of I Could Have Danced All\nNight)\nThanks to all who took part and their sponsors.\nA new recording of Lady Macbeth is reviewed on page 16\n\n"

    "content": "2 News\nSports Merger To Go Ahead In July '94\nBY JOE MCFADDEN The two largest student sporting\nbodies in Britain are to merge in\nJuly 1994, creating a centralised\nsports administration.\nThe new organisation will be\ncalled the British University Sports\nAssociation ( BUS A) and will\nreplace the University Athletics\nUnion (UAU) and the British University Sporting Federation (BUSF).\nImperial College (IC) and St\nMary's are both members of U AU, which handles team sports at the\ninter-university level in England,\nbut not of BUSF, which organises\nregional events throughout Britain.\nIC students competing at this level\nwould represent the University of\nLondon Union (ULU), which is a member of BUSF, rather than IC\nitself. Because the new organisation\nwill take its constitution from\nBUSF, London colleges have had\nno individual say in the merger\ndecision; only UL U could vote.\nCharles Leary, Imperial College\nUnion's( ICU) Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), feels that one\nvote will not be enough for the\n70,000 London students and 37\ninstitutions. \"I am unhappy that\nmost of the decision making\nprocess went on in a meeting we\nhad no vote in,\" he said.\nMr Leary explains that although\nSt Mary's and IC would continue to\nenter separate teams, ICU will pay\nthe total subscription to BUS A, invoicing St Mary's afterwards.\nSubscription fees depend on the\nPrince's Trust Donation To Nightline\nKate Barlow accepting a cheque from The Prince's Trust\nBY LYNN BRAVE Y PHOTO BY DIANA HARRISON University of London Union's( ULU) Nightline has become the\nfirst student body ever to receive a grant from the Prince's Trust.\nThe cheque, made out to the\nvalue of \u00a3850, was presented at the\nPrince's Trust headquarters to Kate\nBarlow, officer in charge of Nightline, by Tom Shebbeare, Director\nof the Prince's Trust headquarters.\nBarlow said that the money given\nwould go towards training costs for\nvolunteers, who have to spend a weekend away. She went on to say:\n\"Nightline is very happy to receive\nthe grant, this being the first time\nthe trust has recognised students as\na 'needy' group. The Trust's aims\nare to provide money for young\npeople to help other young people.\nThey stressed that they will not be\nable to consider individual students\nfor such grants.\"\nThe recognition by the Prince's Trust for the need of Nightline's services should help in the attempt\nto secure Government money for\nthe scheme. Although John Patten\nassured students that 'student union\nreforms should not affect welfare\nservices', Nightline could suffer\nfrom a possible de federal is ation of\nthe University of London as\ncolleges currently support the\nscheme. This may not be the case\nfollowing a split.\nNightline was originally set up\nin 1971 at Imperial College following four suicides in one year at the\nCollege. It moved to UL U five\nyears ago and now provides a service to all students in London. It\nruns throughout the night and\ndoesn't just deal with emotional\nproblems; it has information on\neverything going on in London.\nGuilds Treasurer Resigns\nBY MARK SIMMONS Dr Paul Ewing, Honorary Senior\nTreasurer of City and Guilds\nCollege Union ( C&GC U), announced his resignation this\nweek. Dr Ewing, a lecturer in the\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, has been involved in the\nC&GC U for over a decade.\nIn a letter to Paul Griffith,\nC&GC U President, Dr Ewing\nwrote, T feel strongly about staff\ninvolvement in student affairs, but I do not want to carry on with the\nway things are being controlled by\nImperial College Union - I am\nreally just a cheque signing\nmachine. It's time to go'.\nImperial College Union (ICU)\noriginally assumed the management\nof the finances of the Constituent\nCollege Unions' (CCUs') to reduce\nadministrative costs, but Mr Griffith feels that this is becoming\n'a level of bureaucracy you would\nnot expect of a student union'.\nIn an interview on Imperial\nCollege Radio, Mr Griffith said,\n\"It's been building up over a number of years. We're finding that\nmore and more of our say over\nwhat we do with our money is\nbecoming less and less ours.\"\nSpeaking about the resignation,\nMr Griffith told Paul Dias, IC\nRadio News Editor, that Dr Ewing\nis finding he is prevented from\nmaking basic decisions on where\nmoney should be going. \"He feels\nthat his job has been eroded as a result of the relationship between\nICU and [C& GCU].\"\nIn his letter, Dr Ewing wished\nthe C&GC U every success in the\nfuture, saying, T have enjoyed my\nyears as Senior Treasurer. Thank\nyou all'.\nsize of the institution, but a flat rate\nwill be introduced as part of the\nmerger, lowering the cost to ICU.\nSt Mary's will be represented in\nBUSA by ICU, despite the fact that\nSt Mary's has always been treated\nas a separate entity from Imperial.\nGreg Jones, U AU Chairman,\nsaid that separate votes for IC and\nSt Mary's is an area that we need to\naddress, a sentiment echoed by Mr\nLeary, who stressed the importance\nof clearing up misunderstandings\nbefore the merger takes effect.\nFreddie!\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM A statue in honour of rock star\nFreddie Mercury could be erected\nin Beit Quad, if plans by 'Queen\nProductions' go ahead.\nThe company handles the affairs\nof Queen, the group fronted by\nFreddie until his death from AIDS\nin 1991. It has made an informal\napplication to Imperial College for\npermission to build the memorial\non College land.\nThe site was chosen last year\nafter being surveyed by Jacky Gunn\nfrom Queen Productions. The\ncompany had previously been\nrefused permission to build a commemoration at Freddie's home\nin Kensington. The surviving\nmembers of the band are 'very\nenthusiastic' about placing the\ntribute in what is 'the birthplace of\nQueen'.\nGuitarist Brian May formed the\nband whilst studying at Imperial\nCollege. The first live show\n(without Freddie Mercury) was\nplayed in the Union Building.\nIrene Drexler, a native of\nHungary now in London, has been\ncommissioned to sculpt the statue.\nShe has been given a 'free reign'\nover what the tribute will depict. A wealth of research material\n(including videos and other\nparaphernalia) has been provided.\nThe request has, as yet, not been\napproved by Ian Caldwell, the new\ncollege Estates Manager, who\nentered the job at the end of last\nmonth. An official response may\nnot be possible until after the next\nManagement Planning Group\nmeeting on 13th December.\nMercury died at his home two\nyears ago this week, aged 45. The\ncost of the statue will come from\nhis estate.\nThe Nightline telephone number is 071 436 5561\n\n"

Do you want to know what will happen to your club or\nsociety? Read on....\nReform?\nThe Government have long resolved to 'reform'\nstudent unions. Their aim is to make them more\naccountable, to stop any mismanagement that\nmay exist and above all to give students a greater choice in whatever collective involvement they wish. Sounds good, doesn't it? But\nhow are they going to go about it?\nYou may have known that the Government\nwanted to make certain activities open to all\nstudents. These are 'core' activities and they can\nbe funded using public funds. Currently all of\nour Union's activities are funded by public\nfunds.\nAs for the rest, they are 'non-core'? This\nwould be on a 'voluntary opt-in basis', to coin\nJohn Patten's phrase. You want to take part in a non-core activity? Then you pay your own way.\nThat may seems fair to some, but what is a legitimate 'core' activity?\nTo put it simply, core activities break down\ninto four main areas:\n\u2022 Sport\n\u2022 Welfare\n\u2022 Internal Representation\n\u2022 Catering\nIf your club, your society or any student\nactivity doesn't fit into one of these areas, then\nnot a penny of public funds could be spent on\nthat group, no matter how worthwhile it may be.\nIf your activity does fit into one of these areas,\nthen you should expect less money. Why?\nImplementing these reforms means bureaucracy,\nwhich means time and time means money. That\nmeans less money for the residual 'core' clubs.\nThe Reform Bill is going before the House of\nLords. In it, the Secretary of State asks the Lords\nto allow him to choose, at a later date, what he\nconsiders to be legitimate student activity. It\nisn't even described in the Bill what will be\nlegitimate to fund and what activities will not be.\nWhat can we do?\nWrite. Write to your MP here at college and at\nhome. Tell your MP what you think of the Bill,\nhow it could ruin you club, ask him to question\nthe Minister and to report back to you. By now,\nthe Union will have started its campaign to\ninform Members of Parliment of the value of\nstudent unions. If we all write to our MPs then\nwe can change this Bill for the better. Listen for\ndetails at your club meetings, in your department\nand in your hall of residence. At the same time,\nour Union officers are contacting MPs, ministers, local council members, business\nleaders, anyone and everyone who can help us to\nkeep all of our clubs, teams, societies.\nFor further information, contact Andrew\nWensley on extension 3501.\nElimination by Sphinx\nEliminate two words from the right hand columns for each clue on the left.\nWhich is the word left over?\na.

    "content": "18 Reviews\nTeenage Fanclub and the Juliana Hatfield Three\nCambridge Corn Exchange\nShe comes in happy, the quintessential college\ngirl; Evan Dando's overshadowed Siamese twin,\nif you believe all we write. From last year's solo\nouting comes an all new lineup. If you carefully\nobserve, there are three people on stage and only\none has the initials JH. They start playing and\nit's obvious that we'll have to work for our\natmosphere tonight. Juliana's stage presence is\nnot huge, she's pretty static and the rest of the\ntrio don't add anything. Just let the music talk.\nThe usual instrumental surface of every indie\nband from the Corn Exchange to Ulan Bator is\nbeing embraced on stage. Only what has been\nlabelled as \"girl ie squeaky vocals\" propel us to\nsomething higher. Maybe the phrase could be\nsoftened but, as a description we can relate to,\nit's spot on. The whole vocal package is strung\nin a way that you don't get from any testosterone d perspective. The swooping drawn out\njoy at the end of a chorus or the scraping rhymes\nand undulations become alive and treasured.\nYou don't need the Riot Grrrls to have feminine\nmusic, you only need a woman.\nThe songs are mainly from 'Become What\nYou Are', latent with self fulfil ing improvement\nand only the piquant 'Everybody Loves Me But\nYou' pokes through from a solo past. For\nsomeone of her poster lauded dimensions it's a strange title but that's the path she travels. A world underpinned with melancholy and\nintroversion. We never gain what we think we\nwant and even when we do it flees away. That's what gives the gig a poignancy, because it's not\ngood and yet is an honest statement. I will her to\nbe good and the fact that she isn't reflects more\non me and my perceptions.\n\"Are you cold out there?\" Someone in the\ncrowd tries to reply. In fact he tries several times\nbut Juliana can't hear and a light embarrassment\nfalls. This is real voyeurism because it's the\nheart of her personality standing there in a spotlight of dysfunction. The end of the set, as\non the album, is T Got No Idols', a song against\nthe groupies we long to be. Another self-depriving statement which asks us to be honest\nand that's what live music is all about, leaving\nsome of your soul in the mind of the audience.\nTeenage Fanclub are the mirror reverse of\nwhat's gone before. They can hold the stage in\nthe palm of their plectrum and yet they're not\naiming as high as self analysis; that they're alive\nis enough. When things go wrong with the\nspark ie plugs and sockets the show stays on in\nthat happy way. Norman smiles and leads and\nyou know this is as enjoyable for him as it is for\nus and probably more. The first half is excellently solid. The hard graft of super trivial guitars\nin overdrive. Don't knock them but don't expect\neither. As benefits their status as the lovelies\nleading the 'rip off brigade there are covers;\nDylan's 'Tamborine Man' and something from\nGram Parsons, but not a note sounds like their\nsupposed stylised mold Big Star, of course.\nThe second half does limp though. The\nprovincial teenagers down the front are losing\ntheir jumping shoes.

    "content": "16 Reviews\nSiIB m\"....' \u2022':\nLady Macbeth (a new recording)\nIt was 1936, Leningrad opera-goers were\nflocking to Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, and the\nyoung Dmitri Shostakovich seemed to have\nmanaged the delicate balancing act of writing an\noriginal masterpiece which pleased both the\npublic and the Communist Party ideologists.\nBut, as David Fanning points out in his essay on\nthe opera, successful satire is in the eye of the\nbeholder and one scene, the Pirates of\nPenzanski-s Vy Xt caricature of an ostensibly\nCzarist police sergeant, was too close to the\nbone for Stalin.\nThe opera sank almost without trace and has\nonly recently begun to regain its initial\npopularity, despite the composer's attempts to\nrestore the work to grace with his bow dle rise d rewrite of 1963. (In the revised version, although\nshe still poisons her father-in-law and strangles\nher husband, the eponymous Katerina Ismailova\nno longer goes so far as to commit adultery.\nThere's family values for you.)\nThankfully both available recordings are of\nthe original version. Mstislav Rostropovich's1979EMI set is good, but Myung-Whun\nChung's new Deutsche Grammophon (DG)\nrecording is preferable. While Rostropovich and\nthe London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) can,\nwhere necessary, command an abrasive edge\nThe Tales Of\nBeatrix Potter\nBallet Imperial was created by George\nBalanchine in 1941 to the music of\nTchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No 2 and has\nbeen in the Royal Ballet's repertory since 1950.\nAlthough exquisite, the dancing did not have the\nsynchronise d precision expected by this\ndemanding viewer. This revival of the 1950s' version, as I was told by an elderly ballet\nconnoisseur who was seeing the mixed\nprogramme for the third time this season, would\nhave done Balanchine proud (in terms of the\ncostumes and interpretation, at least).\nIf the first part of the evening dragged, Tales\nof Beatrix Potter was as delightful as anticipated\n- a pure and unashamed love for Peter Rabbit,\nSquirrel Nutkin, Jemima Puddle Duck and\nPigling Bland kindled in childhood of c out se helps. The costumes are sheer magic, the cast\nvery brave to pirouette elegantly in costumes\nvery hot to dance in and barely possible to see\nout of. The mice in assorted sizes are endearing,\nwith their tails coiled and tucked neatly to one\nside. The exceptions to this are the incorrigible\nTom Thumb and Hunca Munca who revel in\nwhich eludes Chung; their somewhat dry,\nimmediate sound cannot match the warmth,\ndepth and dynamic range D G give the Orchestra\nof the Bastille Opera. And Chung brings more\nsuppleness to the many passages of rich\nsensuality that fill the score - music described as\n'porno phony' by one contemporary commentator. The situation is similar as far as the title\nrole is concerned: Maria Ewing for D G is\nwarmer and more flexible, while EMI's Galina\nVishnevskaya is steelier.\nChung is sometimes too smooth though: as\ndepicted by the LPO for Rostropovich, the\nhorrible Boris Timofeyevich seems to clump on\nin hob-nailed boots whereas, for Chung, he\nmight as well be gliding on in a tutu for all the\nnotice the first bassoon takes of the phrasing.\nDG's Boris, Aage Haugland, deserves a better\nintroduction than this; he is outstanding among a fine cast whose acting has surely benefited from\nthe run of stage performances which preceded\nthe recording.\nOf the two sets, it's Chung and his singers\nwho have the full measure of the crucial scene,\ngrotesque and also eerily beautiful, in which\nBoris forces Katerina to swear fidelity to her\ndeparting husband (disc 1, track 3).\nRostropovich is better in the black comedy of\nbeing naughty.\nAnother famous tale of a tail is of course that\nof Squirrel Nutkin dancing up and down like a sunbeam whose impertinent riddles try the\npatience of even Old Brown, the owl. The ample\nAunt Pettitoes tearfully sends two of her fine\npiglets Pigling Bland and Alexander to market,\nwhereupon the dashing Pigling Bland stumbles\nupon Pig Wig, a sweet shy Black Berkshire Pig.\nThe romance struck amidst some beautiful piggy\nShostakovich in his twenties\nAct III; more relaxed than Chung in the police\nstation scene, tipsier in the wedding festivities.\nHere, incidentally, EMI are generous with their\nsound effects, which include breaking glass as\nthe toasts are drunk. Elsewhere, such as in the\nhypnotic first meeting between Katerina and\nSergei, her lover-to-be, it's Chung who\ngenerates greater atmosphere.\nPatrick Wood\nTonight in the Great Hall, ICSO play\nShostakovich's awesome Fifth Symphony, his\nresponse to official criticism o/ Lady Macbeth.\nballet results in a wedding even Beatrix Potter\ndidn't envisage!\nA superb ballet for children and (I rather\nsuspect) adults who have never quite grown out\nof the tales of Beatrix Potter's world.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 9\nShankarabaranam - A Cultural Extravaganza\nThe International Tamil Society will be\npresenting Shankarabaranam as one of its main\ncultural events on Saturday 11th December\n1993. A feast of young, talented artistes are\nwaiting to make this performance a great success\nand to capture the hearts of the audience.\nA variety of entertainment will be provided\nincluding a traditional Veena recital, Karnatic\nvocal, Bharathanatyam (dance) and pop music,\nTamil style!\nVeena is an ancient, divine stringed instrument well known for its captivating and peaceful\nmelody. It consists of four main strings which\nare plucked to produce music and three side\nstrings which provide the Thala (beats). Featured\nwill be the London Veena Group on six veen as, accompanied by the Miruthangam, Moresing,\nand Ghatam.\nKarnatic classical music is an ancient, south\nIndian music originated from Karnataka - a state\nin India. It involves the interaction of the voice\nwith other stringed and percussion instruments\nsuch as violin, mir u than gam and ghat am.A vital accompaniment to all Karnatic music\nis the mir u than gam. It is a percussion instrument\nmade of a wooden trunk and two leather heads.\nIt is held across the lap and played in a horizontal position.\nThe more sing consists a flexible iron strip\ncalled the tongue which is fixed on to a ring. The\ncavity of the mouth acts as a resonator when the\ncurled end of the tongue is plugged. Despite the\nfact that it is difficult to play, it produces a delightful and pleasing effect when played\nalongside the mir u than gam. The ghat am is a mud pot used to provide rhythmic accompaniment and is an ancient time-keeping instrument.\nBharatha Natyam (translated as dance of\nIndia) is the purest and oldest form of Indian\nclassical dance. It is a very attractive dance\ndepicting postures of sculptures and art forms\nwhich can be seen on the walls of Hindu\ntemples. The dancer dances to the Nattuvangam\n(beats) which coordinate with the Sathankai\nNatham (rhythm of the bells) which he or she\nwears on the feet. The overall beauty of the\ndance lies in the blending of the Bhava\n(expressions), Raga (music) and Thala (rhythm)\nin harmony and communicating to the audience\nfeelings and emotions of the dancer.\nThe show will conclude with Tamil pop\nmusic. This is an item where east meets west.\nMany eastern and western instruments will\ncombine provide a great climax to the evening.\nThis is the first major cultural event to be\nheld by the newly formed International Tamil\nSociety and we hope to gain a lot of\nencouragement and support to make this event a great success!\nTouche Away!\nOn Saturday 13th November the Fencing team\nwent to Reading University to compete for the\nU AU South Central title. The other participating\nuniversities were Thames Valley, Reading,\nRH B NC, Kingston and Portsmouth. Our foil\nteam were Jeffrey Wong, Tim Wynn and\nPoomjai Nacaskul. The e pee team were Jeffrey\nWong, Tim Wynn and Chris Ince. Finally, our\nsabre team were Shafik Saba, Chris Ince and\nSean Jauss.\nImperial College won this division by a solid\nmargin, allowing us to compete in next month's South championships. The results were:\nEvent vs Reading vs RH B NC vs Th. Valley\nFoil 5-4 8-1 6-3\nEpee 3-6 4-5 4-5\nSabre 6-3 4-5 6-3\nThe total number of victories were compiled to\ndetermine the winners: Imperial - 47; Thames\nValley - 40; Reading - 39; RHBNC - 36.\n(Kingston and Portsmouth did not show up\nfor some very important and secretive reason!)\nThanks to all the team members for a great\neffort arid loads of enthusiasm. Special mention\ngoes to Shafik Saba for an exceptional performance and for coming on such short notice; Tim\nWynn for a great performance and for driving\nmost of us to Reading and back; Jeffrey Wong\njoining the team at the last moment; Poomjai for\nhis exciting fencing; Chris for being Captain of\nthis miscellaneous group and finally myself for\nwriting this silly article which is little more than\nan advertisement for the club!\nThe South division title is on 8th December\nand we will try to win it with equal fer v our. Boat Club Results\nOn Saturday 27th November, Imperial College\ntook part in the National Indoor Rowing\nChampionship at Bracknell, Berkshire.\nDeciding to concentrate on the new team\nevent rather than individual glory, the squad of\ntwelve dominated the event with an average\ntime over 2500 metres from the top rowers of\n7mins51 sees, which demolished the opposition,\nincluding Under-23 World Champions from the\nUniversity of London Boat Club and the\nReading University Boat Club.\nA stunning individual time of 7mins42 secs from newcomer Alistair Middleton, second only\nto Olympic Champion Matthew Pinsent, was the\nhighlight of a great team performance that netted\nthe club the prize of a \u00a3700 brand new Concept\nII Ergometer rowing machine.\nVolleyball\nIC 3 - 2 City\nThe Imperial College Volleyball Club travelled\nto City University on Wednesday evening for\ntheir first U AU game of the year. City, who had\nbeaten Brunei last week 3 - 0 , had an impressive\nline up consisting of National Division players\nand an International England player.\nThe warm-up started with some intimidation\nfrom City's England player. Balls he had\ncasually hit over the 2.44m net bounced around\nour feet and into the ceiling.\nWe won the first set 15 - 12. Joel Ikoal got\nhis customary yellow card when he questioned\none of the referee's decisions. The second and\nthird sets were lost by us, despite the valiant\nattempts of Robert Stravens at drawing the\nopposition block on his many dummy runs.\nWe entered the fourth set doubtful of\nwinning. However, some incredible hard hitting\nby Peter Desing and Joel easily outshone City's international and won us the set 15 - 3.\nThe fifth set was the best one we played. The\nwinner of this set would win the game. Good\nblocking by Shervin Badamshi and Sebastian\nFanlan, of City's international (not bad,\nconsidering some two to three feet height\ndifference between him and us), caused him to\nlose his nerve, hitting balls out. This allowed\nPeter and Joel to attack, slamming ball after ball\ninto the ground. This set also saw good play by\nPiotr Stancyzk. We won that set 15 - 9 putting\nus into the next U AU round.\nFancy playing the Japanese 'Endurance' game? See page 5\n\n"

(8)\nRidley Dash\nReleased on Ultimate\nThe Orb\nLive '93\nReleasing a live album is simply not good\nenough for a band like The Orb. They exist to\npush back our musical boundaries, not to sit\nback and play safe. So how come they get away\nwith it? It's not simply a hard copy of an Orb\ngig, more of an instrumental voyage, taking in\nperformances at Tokyo, Copenhagen, and\nGlastonbury, revisiting and reworking tracks\nfrom their back catalogue.\nExcellent sound quality does not allow the\ncrowds to intrude into the worlds they create as\nthey transform and blend everything under the\nsun into their own musical heaven.

This is not an\ninvitation to a show that would put Soho to\nshame, but to hear an hour of chamber music\nexpertly performed at our concert. This will take\nplace in the Read Lecture Theatre at 8.15pm on\nTuesday 7th December. Works performed will\ninclude the Pachelbel Canon, and pieces by\nCBE Bach, Mozart and many, many others.\nAdmission will be free for members and\n\u00a31.50 for everyone else.

Tension is built up by\ndirector McTiernan's skillful use of\nthermal-imaging point of view shots\nas the Predator stalks the commandos and picks them off in\nvarious interesting ways. Fun, tense\nand a chance to see Arnie in his\nPredator and\nPredator II\nnatural habitat.\nThe sequel is a more blatant action e er, quoting heavily from Robocop and Aliens, but is\nhugely enjoyable and gives Danny Glover a chance to shine outside his Lethal Weapon\nbuddy cop sidekick role.\nThe Predator comes to Los Angeles for a spree of violence {He's in town with a few days\nto kill) adding to the going carnage caused by\nKing Willy and his voodoo posse.

So I want all\nyou co ooo ol dudes out there, and the rest, to be\nthere.\nIt's going to have events for everybody.\nNaturally, as we are meant to show off our\nculture, we're gonna have the very traditional\n'Endurance' game! This will be based on the\nhighly infamous game show which was serial is ed on Clive James On TV. For those of you who\ndon't know what it is, you don't know what\nyou've missed. Ask anybody who's watched it.\nThey'll all tell you how funny and excellent it is.\nOf course, to hold this event we need\n'volunteers'. They will get free drinks and food\nand there's gonna be a big, big prize. The more\ncontestants there are, the more willing we are to\nput up the prize. For those who are interested,\nplease either turn up early to the party or contact\none of the committee members. (N.B. It isn't going to be at all harmful and is going to be a lot\nof fun for both contestants and spectators.)\nBut this isn't the only event. We're also\ngoing to be holding a Japanese dating game.\nThis was held last year and was extremely\nsuccessful. Basically, it's a good opportunity to\nmeet members of the other sex and possibly the\ngirl/guy of your dreams. But, be warned, some\nof the committee members have been known to\ndress up as the opposite sex, especially our\nPresident. (Actually, he would be very beautiful\nif he was born a girl but, alas, he was born a guy.) Anybody who turns up can join in and it\nreally is a good opportunity/excuse to talk to\nother people at the party. More details about\nhow it actually works will be at the door.\nOf course, this end of year party will not be a Japanese event without the infamous Karaoke.\nThis is a wonderful chance for those who are\ntalented/brave/drunk/stupid enough to sing to\ntheir hearts content. A warning, though. If you\nsee our President approaching the microphone,\neither tackle him or run for your lives.\nThere will also be a disco which will end this\nwonderful night allowing you to show off your\nwonderful moves and groove on down or just\nwatch our committee members make complete\ndick-heads out of themselves.\nAnd how much is this all going to be, I hear\nyou ask? Only \u00a31 for Japan Society Members or\n\u00a31.50 for non-members. Excellent offer, I hear\nyou cry. And it's promising to be an excellent\nevent to end this term. For more details just\ncontact one of committee members or look at\nour notice board (No. 56) which is just opposite\nthe Union Bookshop.\nMake sure you show up to the party on\nSaturday (tomorrow)!\nFind details about a Cultural Extravaganza on page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies\nA Weekend in the Life of Climbers and Cavers\nIf only everything in life was as reliable as an\nImperial College Union van. One van, hired\nexternally, had no cassette player and would\nonly tune to Tom Jones on Radio Wales FM outside of London. But the journey was made\nexciting by a brief encounter with a kamikaze\nrabbit on an icy 1 in 5.\nWhile hardened mountaineers opted for a night outside, the cavers punished themselves by\nsleeping communally in the hut's married\nquarters.\nAlthough we didn't reach the crag until\nmidday, we climbed several worthwhile routes\non sandstone until it got dark. The alpine 'neck'\nbelay and super-solo were techniques most of us\nopted not to try. Others went down local caves\nand got thoroughly immersed.\nA beer y evening started with lots of wild\nplans for routes on Sunday and ended in confessions in the married quarters, lots of heavy\nbreathing and other noises.\nThe climbers were up bright and early, had a full breakfast and were outside in the falling\nsnow push starting the van up a Himalayan\nmountain before the rest started stirring. We\ndrove to the coast where it was decided not to\nclimb immediately with ropes due to risk of\navalanche and drowning at the bottom of an\na bse il. Instead, wicked bouldering problems\nwere tackled at the beach, we ate pots of jam and\ncream at the tea shop and went to inspect further\nalong the cliffs (where we found about three\nbolted routes just as it was time to be heading\nback). A little rough driving (on purpose) and\nsome navigation of sorts got us back in time to\nmake a first ascent of the economy pork sausage\nmountain before the caving party emerged.\nWe travelled back to the sounds of Bob\nDillan and the Jam. Oh, for Heaven's sake! A ticket to ride in the other van please!\nICMC's traditional final trip of term will be\nto Bosigran in Cornwall. There is excellent\nclimbing to be done just below the hut at this\nawesome winter resort. Anyone who'd like to go\nshould sign up on the MC's notice board (by the\nclimbing wall next to the JCR).\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE MALAYSIAN SOCIETY\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\nTo Discuss THE INAUGURATION OF\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION\nMALAYSIA SUBCOMMITTEE\nCRUCIAL FOR ALL MEMBERS TO ATTEND\nTIME: 2.00PM VENUE: 220 LT MECHANICAL ENGINEERING\nDATE: WEDNESDAY, 8TH DECEMBER 1993\nENQUIRIES: H.M.

    "content": "14 Reviews\nStarring: Angelica Huston, Raul Julia,\nChristopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack,\nCarol Kane.\nDirector: Barry Sonnenfeld\nFrom the opening credits onwards, the film\nlooks great. With the high quality of both the\nsets and the direction, you are forced to suspend\nyour belief in what is normal and find yourself\nwillingly entering the world of the family\nAddams. I always found the cult TV series\nmediocre and preferred instead the blunt\nhumour of the Munsters. But this, the second\nAddams Family movie has lost nothing in the\ntransition to the big screen and has indeed\ngained greatly in status.\nThere's a new member to the Addams, the\nbaby Pubert, arriving amongst the opening\ncredits. The kids are jealous, the uncle's lonely,\nthe hand is rollerskating. A nanny is hired, uncle\nfalls for nanny (who's after uncle's money),\nkids realise the nanny's only after their uncle's money, nanny gets kids packed off to summer-camp...and so the stage is set for one of the\nfunniest movies I 've (we've) seen all year. The\nplot is split in two, with one part cent ring on the\nnanny and uncle and the other part on the kids at\nsummer camp. Definitely a film for all ages; fun for the kids\nbut with enough subtle one liners (often so\nsubtle that I was one of the only people in the\ncinema laughing) to set it above the slapstick\nHome Alone set. Thankfully, the baby Pubert\nwas not given a larger part, otherwise it would\nThey 're really rather spooky and utterly quite kooky - The Addams Family and their Values\nbe in danger of stealing the show. From the\nmoment that he is born with slicked black hair,\npallid Addams complexion and that cute little\nAddams moustache, up to when he is recovering\nwith a hangover (still in cot, but with shades on)\nfrom a wild party, you can't help but like him.\nThe person that does steal the show must be\nthe daughter, Wednesday. Placing her and\nPugsley (their son) in an o.t.t. summer camp was\na scriptwriter genius. Camp Chippewa is hell on\nEarth for the pair, full of the offspring of class-conscious yuppies with the two leaders being\nso ooo cheery and friendly as to make you puke.\nWhat makes the camp complete, though, is\nthe Harmony Hut where naughty children are\nsent to make them nice. With its nice friendly\natmosphere (Michael Jackson posters on the\nwalls), the children are sent here to watch\nDisney videos, and such horrors as The Sound\nof Music, The Brady Bunch and Annie! As I said - Hell on Earth.\nThe problem with sending something up so\nmuch as to go completely over the top, is that\nyou often lose the humour (Mike C. take note).\nThis, however, holds on to it with skill and style\nand makes for an hilarious finale.\nWith great performances and a pacing so\nsteady and smooth, the ending arrives all too\nquickly. Perhaps the only down point is the\ncharacter of Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd).\nBetween us we didn't think his costume was as\nnaturally realistic as that of others and that his\nmannerisms weren't quite right for the\ncharacter. Having these things niggling\nthroughout the film doesn't help, especially\nwhen it is one of the central characters of the\nfilm, but it takes nothing away from the film\nitself. With neither of us having seen the first\nfilm, we can't tell you if this was better or\nworse, but we definitely enjoyed it immensely.\nBonnie & Clyde\nSilent Tongue\nAs you might expect from the writer of Paris,\nTexas, the new movie from American playwright Sam Shepard is both slow and low on\nplot, despite probably uniquely, being a Western\nGhost story.\nTalbot Roe (River Phoenix) is mad with grief\nat the death of his half-native Indian wife, Ebon.\nHe obsessively holds onto her body, refusing to\nlet her memory go.\nUnable to escape his manacle grasp, her\nspirit cannot rest and so her ghost returns\nangrily to haunt him and generally cause havoc.\nRiver Phoenix, in his final film, acquits\nhimself well and with his highly acclaimed\nperformance in My Own Private Idaho gives an\nindication of how he perhaps desired to\nundertake more challenging roles.\nAlan Bates gives a bold performance as the\ncomic Eamonn McCree, a travelling showman\npeddling patent medicines.\nThe film exploits our notions of primitive\nnative mysticism in an attempt to bolster the\ntraditionally simplistic Western. However, the\nfine performances are unable to raise this film\nabove the hum-drum level of a tired genre.\nJohn\nChild's Play\nThis is a German film examining a thirteen year\nold boy's disillusionment with life.\nEmbarking on the path towards adulthood\nhas already been focused upon and many clich es can be found in the film, which does have some\ngood moment. The characters, too, are\ncompletely stereotypical and therefore\nsomewhat uninteresting. This comment applies\nto males, females, children and adults.\nThe film captures the ill effects of life in a far-from-ideal family and environment, but not\nquite well enough to make it worth seeing.\nAmir Rehman Khan\nICSF are showing Predator and Predator II.

    "content": "Reviews 17\nTflnmm\nThe Mayflies\nA parody of the Greek myths, The Mayflies was\nfirst performed in this year's Edinburgh Festival\nand is the comic story of the consequences of\ndivine (and modern) intervention in the city of\nMaeflos in the 8th Century BC.\nZeus, the supreme deity, aided by his loyal\nservant Death unleashes his wrath on mortals to\npunish them for accepting fire, stolen from\nHeaven by the Titan, Prometheus. Zeus\nsentences mankind to die at sunset like mayflies\nwho live only from dawn to dusk after indulging\nin an orgy of procreation. The trouble (of\ncourse) begins when Zeus orders the creation of\nWoman in the mould of Aphrodite, the goddess\nof Love, to be unleashed on errant mortals.\nAn excellent and very strong cast of three\nplay the dozen or so parts of gods, heroes,\nvillains and ordinary mortals, male and female.\nAphrodite, played by Kate Terrence, was at\ntimes the queen of vamp and at others, a bored,\nspoilt teenager. Julian Protheroe played a rather\nguileless Hector, lover of Phoebe. Particularly\nenjoyable was Priestess Hermione, also played\nby Kate Terrence, desperately looking for a fall\nfrom grace before sunset.\nThe versatile costumes designed by John\nO 'Callaghan who works with Vivienne Westwood are both comic and effective. Hector's costume of chainmail, presumably worn in the\nTrojan War, seemed to be made from silver\nlure x and Aphrodite's cape was what can only\nbe described as the colour of lust.\nDon't look too deeply for a moral; the play is\nmore an exercise in style which is, by the way,\nvery enjoyable. Written in the form of 'poetry'\nin the Homeric style and mixed with modern day\ncolloquialisms, there were curious and humorous\nshades of Margaret Thatcher in Aphrodite and\nDel Boy of Only Fools And Horses, in Zeus. It\ndid take the audience the whole of the short first\nact to become accustomed to the style. A much\nlonger second act gave us time to enjoy it.\nThe play seemed to fall short on one\nimportant point: omitting the underlying message,\nessential to good satire. Abuse of power and the\nexistence of suffering may be just another\nmanifestation of the futility of existence, but this\ndoes not sustain a credo. One could possibly\nequate the activities of the gods with those lesser\ngods, politicians, but that would somehow\nencumber the enjoyment of this essentially lighthearted play. It's just good fun, more in the style\nof a Carry On film.\nRekha Nayak and Ariana Sen\nAttic Theatre, The Ballroom, 103 The\nBroadway, Wimbledon, SW19. 081 542 6141.\nTube: Wimbledon. Cones \u00a34, \u00a35. (Membership\n\u00a31).\nStrip\nStrip is a play that deals with extremes of\nexperience; and regrettably it's extremely\ntedious. Jo (Fionna Padfield) and Gunter (Archie\nKoffgaard) gradually reveal their respective\nperversions: he has a penchant for sado-masochism, she gets of on stripping. If this\nsounds promising, read on...\nIt turns out (after some time) that a desire to\ndominate is Jo's reaction to an inferiority\ncomplex and she finds nakedness on stage a powerful expression of it. She revels in the\ncontrol of her body and, through that, the control\nof her spectators. Gunter, however, is cool and\nanalytical throughout; he yearns release from the\ncontrol of his mind and the rationality which\ntempers his existence.\nThe playwright (also Fionna Padfield) is\nadvocating exploration of one's perversions; and\nrather simplistic ally she isn't held back by any\ncomplications of real life, for example, the real\nchanges inherent in all this (especially for\nwomen). But that's not really the issue here; the\npoint is that the sado-masochism which is the\nemotional climax of the play, in fulfilling the\ncharacter's desires of domination and submission respectively, ultimately liberates them\nfrom their obsessions; a process of purification.\nAn old proverb says 'One showing is worth\none hundred tellings', or ' A picture is worth a thousand words'. It's a shame that most of the\nplot is narrated in long tiring monologues rather\nthan acted out. All speech is directed at the\naudience, rather than between Jo and Gunter.\nCall it subtlety underplayed if you like, it's like watered down Berkoff and would work\nbetter on radio.

    "content": "Feature 19\n\"All You Know Is What You See...\"\nSo says Juliana Hatfield in 7 Got No Idols' and Owain reluctantly concurs.\nHow does a dreamy shoe gazer meet his stars?\nWe roared here in a rocket fuelled on\nspeculation, liquid anticipation, burning our\nseconds above the Cambridge snow. A thirty\nminute touchdown on the surface of another's reality. And I don't mean she's a goddess and I don't mean I'm an undiscovered marvel - I'm just trying to make friends. Tintin has a different\nphilosophy and we expound and pound each\nother in the pub next door for hours after. But\nfirst the interview.\nJuliana Hatfield, ex Blake Baby, ex her own\nwoman ('Hey Babe' her sole solo outing), now a third of the much praised and purchased Juliana\nHatfield three. 'Become What You Are', their\ndebut album, is like an expanding bubble of\nbubblegum pop; bright, light and deceptively\nsweet. Listen harder and find the saccharine, the\nadditives, the aftertaste. Cryptic? Juliana is as\nshe seems, but not as you might see her.\nWe are talking in a vault high above the\nrafters of the Cambridge Corn Exchange. She\nappears bored, shy, interested, restless and\nexhausted all at once and fidgets and slams her\nboots near our tape recorder too often for\ncomfort. Listening later, the mic has picked up\nother-room ly sounds; footsteps outside, cars\npassing, the Posies in the massive hall below.\nBut it can't record the glances, the angle of her\nhead, the shape and timbre of a person's tone.\nJust the way she says the usually thrown away\nphrase T don't know', as if caught in a Faustian\nmoment of indecision. I'm won before we start.\nAnd she's lost. I pass her a Felix to sample.\n\"Let's see if there's anything about me in here,\"\nshe smiles and flicks through to a Lemonheads\nreview wherein I describe her backing vocals as\n'squeaky' and 'girl ie'.I blurt out something\nabout meaning the way she just pops up on the\ntracks being intrusive and even beneath her, but\nshe insists it was Belinda Carlisle and rather than\nargue we move swiftly on. How' s the tour\ngoing? \"Good, yeah, I got sick as soon as I got\nto England.\" The start is aimless; we have to talk\na while before she begins to open up. Tintin asks\nif it's hard singing such personal songs.\n\"Nah, because they're not real songs. I made\nthem up.\" She pauses. \"It's really a compliment\nthat you believed them...sucker!\" So it's more in\nthe tradition of old transportable lyrics? \"Err,\nyeah. If I kept a diary, I wouldn't want anyone to\nread it. That's why I don't have a diary. I don't want people to know how I think. So I'm not\ngoing to put my diary in my songs you know?\"\nShe continues, \"I like music because it's in\nthe air. I like music because no-one can take it\naway from me - I could write it down but I don't, it's in my head. If my house burnt down\nor the world blew up I'd still have my songs.\"\nYears ago Miss Hatfield belonged to an\naudacious band of child prodigies, Blake Babies,\ndescribed recently by NME as one of their\ngreatest ever oversights. Juliana is non-plus sed about the release of a Blake Babies compilation.\n\"Well, I don't really care about it, it wasn't my idea. I dunno, I guess they're trying to capital is e on it.\"\nJuliana, am I doing you justice? This wasn't an interview, it was three unheard soliloquies.\nMaybe you were just bored.\nTintin blunders in with a quote from the press\ndescribing her as fermented from 'illicit beer,\nchocolate and Biactol' - the girl next door (with\npimples.) \"What?\" she exclaims. It's not his\nown phrase he blusters back. \"Oh.\" If she gets\nthis involved in a conversation with two no good\ns tudes, is it any wonder she's rebuffed the studs,\nor is described as difficult, tortured, a bit mad?\n\"Was she nice?\" my little sister asks later.\nLook Rhian, she's a human being - am I nice?\nPeople are not drawn on flat paper...\n\"It's not my fault if people try to paint me as\na cartoon character. I don't put a lot of effort\ninto my image.\" She pauses, breathes in, slams\nher boot down. \"I'm just trying to come across as\na complete person, like anyone would.\" But the\npress don't like their copy standard A4. She says\nthey're jealous, basically, \"of people having fun\nmaking music. They put so much passion and\nhate into writing about bands and who's going to\nbe the next big thing and it's like, who cares?\nIt's really not that important.\"\nShe says she doesn't read the press so she\ndoesn't care how they colour her. But isn't that\npart of her game? If she sings songs that aren't real then she's fair target for their fantasies?\n\"We'l,I 've real feelings and stuff but I just\ndiscard them,\" she objects. \"It's not like I'm some cold-blooded writer.\" All this press talk\nwas irrelevant, she really is above it, or sideways\nremoved from it. And that's why she's precious,\nbecause she's just living her life like you, me or\nJoe sixteen. We go back to serious music talk.\n\"Yeah, I gave up the solo stuff because it was\njust too much hassle to audition people. Plus, I don't trust myself to do the right thing.\"\nThe title 'Become What You Are' was stolen\nfrom a book she reveals with a blush. No, the\nfact that the other band members only appear on\nfar distant plains in the group photos doesn't come from her. And no, she doesn't listen to or\neven like her own music much. I mention a rather bitchy comment I read which disallowed\nher from sadness because she was rich and\nattractive. Her reply is slow and thoughtful; the\nweight of the room is on her shoulders.\n\"I can't help the way I look or that I wasn't living in poverty,\" a long pause, \"ever...I suffer,\njust in different ways to some other people.\nEverybody suffers.\" The way she says this, so\nhonest I know I won't be able to relate this back\nin London, that they'll think me overblown or\nblown over. I let slip the dreaded name of Evan\nDando and our noble pact is broken.\n\"Evan,\" she corrects. \" Ah, Evan, like in\nHeaven!\" I say and mention his comment that it\nwould be better to mess up with drugs then make\nanother ten Lemonheads albums.\n\"Ahhh,\" she giggles. \"Well, I don't think\nthey've made a bad album yet.\" (Of course she's going to be biased, being an old head.) The\nconversation gets rolling and informal and it\nalmost doesn't matter that both me and Tintin\nare here (a mistake, we decide later. Impolite,\npossibly rude.) We plug our favourite new bands\nand collide spectacularly with a mutual love of\nMadder Rose. Hmmm, NME claimed they stole\nall their best ideas from Blake Babies.\n\"That's a bunch of bullshit - they don't sound\na thing like the Blake Babies. I read that and I was like 'What the Hell?' We toured with them\nand they're really cool.\" We talk about fans.\n\"You'd be surprised. Some people follow\nbands around the whole country. Wackos.\" Then\nlater, \"I didn't really mean wackos.\" Can't she\nlet anything go?\nWe tell her of our visions of rescuing her\nfrom a Cambridge scrum of admirers and sycophants but she insists she's never recognised. In\norder to raise her profile Tintin suggests a quick\nphoto.\n\"Oh, I don't want to,\" she says, recoiling into\nher chair. \"Okay, okay,\" says Tintin soothingly.\nWe worry about our rock star and she's just\nhuman, worries about what people might think\nof her, what you might read. There's no twist in\nthat uncertainty. We end and say our farewells.\nIt all went wrong.\nI don't want to be a journalist.\n\"I was born of people's needs and what they don't wanna believe\"\n\n"

    "content": "News 3\nExpansion Plans for Medical Faculty\nBY PAUL DIAS AND MARK SIMMONS\nImperial College could become a medical 'super-school' within two\nyears.\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of\nImperial College (IC), has made\nclear the prospect of further\nexpansion of Imperial's medical\nfaculty through the merger of\nImperial College with Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical\nSchool (CXWMS).\nThis move follows the\nrecommendations in last year's Tomlinson Report on provision of\nhealth care in London. The report\nalso suggested IC merge with three\npostgraduate medical schools, the\nNational Heart and Lung Institute,\nthe Institute of Cancer Research\nand the Royal Postgraduate\nMedical School as part of an\namalgamation of all the current\nLondon medical schools into four\nmain faculties. The merger would\nmean Imperial would play a significantly greater role in British\nmedical teaching and research.\nImperial and CX WM S were\nasked by the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England\n(HEFCE) to present joint proposals\nfor the merger in the light of the\nsuggested health care reforms.\nThe Rector, writing in the\nNovember Issue of Network, the IC\nstaff journal, concluded that the\nbiomedical field is one that is likely\nto offer enormous research\npotential for the future. In his\nopinion the College cannot afford\nto miss this opportunity to expand.\nThe College's reply to the\nHE FCE, entitled 'Strategy for\nMedicine', describes in detail how\nthe proposed merger would be\nimplemented and how it would\naffect IC. The fundamental structural\nchange would be the establishment\nof an expanded 'College of\nMedicine' comprising both graduate\nand undergraduate schools. Such a college would encompass all departments and institutes concerned with\nclinical and NHS-related activities.\nSubstantial building work would\nbe required on the South\nKensington campus for undergraduate teaching facilities. The\ncost of the new biomedical\nbuildings and associated libraries\nand lecture theatres is currently\nestimated at \u00a367 million.\nThe merger would benefit\nCX WM S, currently experiencing\npotentially serious budgetary\nproblems, but could result in the\nclosure of its present facilities.\nThe earliest date for any merger\nwould be August 1995.\nStudent Grants Cut\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nStudent debts are set to increase\nnext year as the Government cuts\nthe basic grant by ten per cent. The\nreduction was announced by the\nChancellor Kenneth Clarke in his\nfirst budget on Wednesday.\nThe reduction in the main rates\nof grant will be offset by an\nincrease in the maximum level of\nloan. This will result in an effective\nrise in possible student income of\nfour per cent. The loan repayment\nsystem will not be affected. Similar\nadjustments will be made over the\nnext two years.\nThe Government intends to\nmake contributions to student\nincome from grants and loans equal\nover the next few years. According\nto the Chancellor, the parental\ncontribution toward student\nmaintenance will be reduced.\nThe changes have met fierce\nopposition from various quarters.\nLorna Fitzsimons, President of the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)\nsaid, \"the government must realise\nthat students cannot take any more\ndebt\". A spokesman for the NUS\nstated that 'we support a grant\nindex-linked to the 1979 level'. The\ngrant level was frozen several years\nago, effectively reducing its value\nannually. Vice-Chancellors accused\nthe Government of 'denying\nopportunities to well-qualified\nstudents'.\nSpeaking on IC Radio, Keith\nBradley MP, Labour Shadow\nSocial Security minister said: \"This\nnew cut in the grant will undermine\n[students'] confidence in entering\nhigher education.\"\nFRESH HAIR SALON the best student offer in london!
