The\nsuccessful candidate should be friendly, responsible and committed to students welfare and pastoral care.\nInformal enquiries can be sent to:\nlinstead.hall@imperial.ac.uk\ntravelling, they have yet to comprehend\nthe motives and habits behind a visitor.\nThis is particularly true with the rise of\nfast-food style tourism, pre-planned daily\nschedules and rigid punctuality, where the\npaying customer gets the hassle-free con-venienceandguaranteedservitudemoney\ncan buy.\nI had sat down with my new friend Flavian, an inhabitant of Walarano, engaged\nin the laughter-packed conversation, when\nLuigi and his wife arrived, demanding\nkava. I took a swig of kava, emptied the\ncup\u2019s content in a few gulps, and watched\nthe Italians pacing back and forth, sweat-ing, as the locals casually prepared the\nkava roots with their trusty grinder.\nFive minutes later, he sent George to the\n\u2018kava bar\u2019 \u2012 merely a shed where the villagers hang out \u2012 to chivvy the production\nteam.\nTen minutes later, shattering the tranquillity of Walarano as well as disrupting me midway through a \u2018story\u2019, with his\nraised tone.\n\u201cIs it so hard to get a kava here? In Tanna\nwe got our kava in one minute \u2012\u201d\nHis voice trailed off in an aggressive\ncough. Recovered, he returned to his heav-ily-accented volley of abuses before telling\nhis wife that they were leaving. The scare\ntactic was to little avail, since the locals\ncould only laugh \u2012 so could Flavian and I.\nDefeated, he gingerly crept into a corner,\nduly sat in silence with the wife until his\nrequest was delivered before him.\nFlavian asked me why Luigi would lose\nhis rag over something petty as a bowl of\nkava.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s in a hurry \u2012\nmaybe he\u2019s late for chickie chickie time?\u201d\nThe circumstances under which I met\nFlavian were truly serendipitous. Seeing\na sign advertising wood carvings I wandered into Walarano to satisfy my curios-ity. We talked, enclosed by Flavian\u2019s carvings that I confessed to have no interest in,\nand he asked me for the favour of checking\nhis application for an Australian visitor\u2019s\nvisa. I obliged, and our acquaintance was\nborn.\nHe was a family man, married with an\nadorable daughter. By no means hampering his ambitions though: over dinner in\nhis house he explained to me how he had\nhopedtoconstructseveralguesthouseson\nthe land beside the sea, which he owned.\nFlavianwasamongstthoseoftheyounger generation of Malekulans who recognised the significance of tourism in improving their living standards. I admired\nhis aspiration \u2012 after all, all he desired\nwere a better upbringing for his daughter\nand more forgiving conditions for a peaceful life.\nI muttered a few words of encouragement on my way out, bade him good luck\nwith the challenges he faced. It left me\npondering: with more Luigi\u2019s and Flavian\u2019s\ntransforming the island, for the better or\nworse, how different will I find Malekula\non my next visit? Will it boast Hilton-style\nprofessional performers, smiles feigned\nand stiff like wax, there to appease an audience of pillagers whose enjoyment and\ncultural learning will not compensate for\ntheir mess?\nI certainly hope not.\ne of the\nd-time\nMalekula Island, and\nthe island\u2019s response\n\n"

Not quite, of\ncourse! The summer months are rolling in (well, not if this week\u2019s weather\nis anything to go by) and there is plenty going on around the city for you\nthrillseekers to kick up your heels to!\nFirst of all, our ever-intrepid ex-plorer, searching for new heights of\ncultural interest - Caz Knight - has dis-covered, in the most unlikely of places,\na pseudo club-theatre-bar under the\narches of London Bridge. The Shunt\nLounge, as it is called, is a maze of tunnels under the station (entrance literally outside the tube barriers) and on\nmost Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays\nyou can find a number of musical and\ntheatrical themed events. There seems\nto be, considering the atmosphere, a\ncertain grittiness to the shows - not\nuncommon in London spots off the\nbeaten track - but certainly a breath of\nfresh (or musty even) air from the rigid\nseating of theatres in the West End.\nAvid arts readers will have read Miss\nKnight\u2019s review of the Shunt Collective\u2019s production of Money last week,\nwhich is a scarily immersive theatrical experience located inside a three\nstorey steel box inside an old tobacco\nwarehouse down the road from the\nLounge. The run has been extended to\nSeptember so be sure to catch it after\nyou are free of exams and labs. The\nLondon Bridge/Borough area is also\nan excellent place for a twilit summer\nevening\u2019s drinking and is all but free of\nthe heaving tourist crowds so common\nto Imperial\u2019s neck of the woods.\nCaz dominates the arts section this\nweek with the second part of her Shunt\nadventure. The dark, cool musty vaults\nare the perfect escape for when the\nweather gets too hot to handle.\nAnd with summer also comes the\nmuch longed for opportunity to read\nfor pleasure. My co-editor ponders\nthe virtues of e-readers versus the\nmore traditional paper pages format of\nbooks in her opinion piece on the opposite page.\nOne more felix left this term so\nplease send any of your reviews into us\nwhile you can!\nCulture in the vaults\nCaz Knight goes deep under London Bridge to the Shunt Lounge\nThe lazy, hazy,\ncrazy days of\nsummer\nRosieMilton\nRosieMilton Arts Editor\nShunt Lounge is open Thursday,\nFriday and Saturday. Entry is 10GBP,\n5GBP for students.\nL\nate night bar. Dungeon.\nNightclub. Art space. Labyrinth. The Shunt Lounge\nis the creation of Shunt, a\ncompany formed by ten artists keen on fusing the live event with\nits audience. The Lounge is a platform\nproject for artists to showcase their\nworks and for the public \u2013 art connoisseurs and ignoramuses alike \u2013 to come\nand enjoy them close up.\nMetres away from the West Cornwall Pasty Co., a vending machine and\nthe tube barriers in London Bridge station is a doorway. The door staff are\nwelcoming, stamp your wrist and usher you into Shunt\u2019s cool, vast interior.\nHigh-ceilings, exposed brickwork and\na damp, musty smell make you realise\nthat you have stumbled into a place like\nno other.\nUnder each of the arches, which extend left and right of the lounge\u2019s long,\nwide corridor, are big empty spaces\nwhich provide the venue for every possible type of art form.\nEach weekend a new programme\nof live music, performance art, visual\nart, DJs and creative workshops is put\non meaning that every weekend you\nvisit will surprise you with something\ndifferent. Last weekend Lautes Licht\n(German for \u2018loud light\u2019) invited viewers to play director by adjusting the\nlighting on its actors, thereby controlling which one of them gets to speak\nand how loudly. A previous weekend\na classical music ensemble played a\npiece of music by the Tudor composer\nThomas Tallis \u2013 making one feel even\nmore as if in a Tudor banquet hall.\nAfter the classical music was over the\nspace was cleared to accommodate a\ndance floor as a DJ began to spin reggae beats. A few weekends before that\nit was pumping techno.\nMore permanent features include\nBob Aldous\u2019 moth: a large moth-shaped mirror illuminated every twen-ty-odd seconds by a strobe light; the\nairplane cinema screens where you can\nescape under large headphones and\nwatch short films from the Raindance\nFilm Festival; a reading room filled\nwith dusty books; small and stowed\naway little wine bars. Outside the toilets stands a Narnian looking tree\nwhile the toilets themselves are home\nto a large shark. The bouncers are few\nand polite.\nShunt lets you explore art in a social\nsetting, but if even this unassuming\nand pioneering art seems too pretentious and erudite for you, then head\nstraight down to the end of the vaults\nwhere a large bar is filled with a huge\nrange of locally sourced beers and ci-ders, cocktails, spirits and wines. A\nhaphazard mix of candlelit tables,\nchairs, sofas and stools abound so you\nare guaranteed not to spend the night\nstanding awkwardly by the bar shouting over the din, unlike most watering\nholes on a weekend in London. Perfect\nfor the claustrophobic or those who\nvalue personal body space.\nYou will see no sign of white-shirt\nclad males and Saturday night on-the-lash testosterone here: only an extremely laid back atmosphere and clientele where you are free to explore as\nmuch or as little of the art as you like.\nShunt promises to delight and enthrall\nthe curious and cultural, anyone craving the unusual or simply anyone who\nwants to drink and make merry.\nRound the corner from the Shunt\nLounge in Bermondsey Street, the\nShunt Collective (Shunt\u2019s theatre com-pany) are staging their adaptation of\nthe nineteenth century French novel\nL\u2019Argent. The show has been extended\nto June 26 and makes for a perfect interlude to an evening spent getting lost\nin the vaults.\nIntricate lighting elevates the \u2018dungeon-like\u2019 atmosphere to modern halls of stylish colour; alcoves revealing passages\nThe Shunt Lounge\u2019s inconspicuous entrance just outside the tube barriers\nAn example of a theatre spectacle, sprung up in an alcove of the Lounge\nTHE ARTS\n\n"

On\nseveral occasions this year, we at felix have caught wind of a potential\nand imminent fiasco unfolding in the\nUnion\u2019s offices. They make good news\nstories, naturally.\nProbing for the particulars can only\nget a journalist so far, and sometimes\nsitting tight and observing the events\nuncovers how big a story actually is.\nIt was no different this week. On\nFriday afternoon, we had a rather\nsweaty Deputy President (who shall\nremain unnamed *cough*Danny\nHill*cough*) enquire about extra advertising for the Summer Ball. He was\na bit too keen for comfort, and it was\nobvious sales spreadsheets were looking a bit bare upstairs. Headlines were\nswinging past our eyes: \u2018Summer ball\nbombing\u2019, or \u2018Summer Balls up.\u201d\nTicket sales weren\u2019t looking brilliant.\nCome Monday evening however,\nboth aforementioned Deputy President and President looked distinctly\nhappier when the subject of ticket\nsales resurfaced at the last Council\nmeeting of the year.\nChecking the figures straight after,\n200 tickets had been sold over the\nweekend and sales figures were apparently back on track when compared to\nlast year\u2019s sales patterns. Panic over\nfor the Union, story in the bin for felix.\nAt the time of writing, the event still\nneeds around 650 tickets to reach last\nyear\u2019s attendance. The Union are hopeful that these tickets will be sold by the\n19th of June, the night of the Ball.\nI\u2019m not entirely sure why ticket sales\nhave been on the slow side. From what\nis on offer, I would have thought tickets would have been snapped up very\nquickly, but evidently not.\nAre the Union doing things right?\nDanny Hill, Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services), who is responsible\nfor organising this ball, has gone for\nwhat he describes \u201ca festival vibe\u201d.\nThere are less DJs and more live\nacts. Instead of one headliner like\nlast year, there are three. Athlete,\nquite frankly a band with a reputation plummeting by the minute, cost\nthe Union \u00a38,000 to book. This year,\nthe Union have spent less on the dinner part of the evening, as well as increasing entry prices, and have used\nnearly a third of a \u00a3110,000 budget on\nthree up-and-coming headline acts\nin Tinie Tempah (he has two recent\nUK No.1s), Noisettes (listen to \u2018Never\nForget You\u2019 and you\u2019ll know them)\nand Plan B (currently in the top ten of\nthe UK album charts).\nRegarding the price, I\u2019ll admit that\n\u00a390 for a dinner ticket is a bit much.\nI wouldn\u2019t pay for it. \u00a345 for a entertainments ticket seems just about rea-sonable, albeit pushing \u2018expensive\u2019 for\nthe acts, plus the funfair and general\nhappenings until the next morning.\nA question that organisers ask every\nyear is whether the Ball can be sustained for the following summer. As\nstudents, we all want a final send-off\nfor our friends. Some of them you\u2019ll\nsee after the summer break, but some\nof them you might never see again.\nIt\u2019d be a great shame for everyone, but\nespecially a graduating year, if they\nwere stripped of a Summer Ball.\nBeing a Biologist, I\u2019ve never been to\na Summer Ball. Maybe my optimism\nis yet to be quashed in a devastating\nway.\nI\u2019m a traditional critic of the Union,\nand you\u2019d guess so since I\u2019m the Editor\nof felix, but I\u2019ve got faith.\nI just want to say goodbye to my\ngraduating friends, get horrendously\nhammered and end the night in my\nown vomit.

Caz Knight weighs up the new fangled toys that are e-readers and why paper is better\nApple\u2019s latest technology: the iPad. A larger, heavier iPhone...with no phone function\nF\nive hundred years ago the\nnumber of books in circulation exploded. Johannes\nGutenberg had just invented a mechanical printing\npress and with it followed the Printing Revolution. Three hundred years\nlater the Industrial Revolution gave us\nmass production and extrapolated the\nnumber of books further. However,\nit has taken just under five centuries\nfrom Gutenberg\u2019s contraption to now\nfor literacy to get to the level where\nmost of the population (in the developed world, anyway) read, or have\nonce read, books.\nCult leader Steve Jobs paints quite\na different picture with his proclamation that \u201cpeople don\u2019t read anymore\u201d,\nexplaining Apple\u2019s absence, hitherto,\nfrom the e-reader market.\nDespite this, 130,000 new titles\nare published every year in the UK\n(190,000 in the USA), not to mention\ntitles that already exist and have existed for hundreds of years. Apparently,\npeople do still read. The question is\nhow?\nWith the flurry of touchable touch\nscreen gadgets released in the last year\nor so the big question has been whether \u201chardware\u201d (printing) will die out,\nusurped by digital, \u201csoftware\u201d formats.\nTrue, more people are accessing news\nvia their mobile phones instead of getting their fingers smudged with ink\n(although I am not sure if this is still\nan issue in 2010), but how many have\nactually abandoned paper pages for a\nscreen?\nE-readers: The Basics\nThe latest piece of superfluous technology to hit the\nmarket is the 500 dollar iPad, which also serves as\nan e-reader. The battle of the e-readers now seems\nto be between E-Ink and iPads/iPhones.\nE-Ink is the provider of the screens for readers such\nas the Sony Reader, Amazon\u2019s Kindle and Barnes &\nNoble\u2019s Nook. The point of the E-Ink screen is to\nminimize strain on the eyes that comes from staring at a backlit screen for too long. Sony\u2019s Reader EInk screen does not have a backlight and thus needs\nto be read in the light like any normal book we have\nbecome accustomed to. The 200 pound Reader was\nthe first e-reader on the market released in 2006. 4\nyears later and its rate of adoption has been poor\ncompared to most high technology offerings in the\n21st century. The Reader needs to have e-books\nuploaded to it after downloading from the 45,000\ntitles available at Sony\u2019s e-book store (rather like\ndownloading then uploading tunes from the iTunes\nmusic store to an iPod).\nAmazon\u2019s Kindle arrived later but decimated\nSony\u2019s hopes of saving face after its Walkman lost\nout to Apple in 2001 when the iPod was released.\nNot only does the Kindle have wireless connection\nto Amazon.com \u2013 so you effectively have access to\na bookstore whenever and wherever you are \u2013 but\nthere are 145,000 titles to chose from. Amazon offered its Kindle at an astounding $9.99, making up\nits lost profits in sales of e-books from its website,\nso no wonder it did better. Its open source software\nalso means you can view titles bought from a range\nof devices, including iPods and iPads.\nPublishing giant Barnes & Noble have entered\nthe e-reader race with their $249 Nook, which\nhas had extremely positive reviews already.\nBoth the Nook and Kindle weigh in at around\nthe 300g mark which is dainty compared with\nthe cumbersome iPad. The E-Ink screens\nare ideal for beach reading as they lack\nsaid backlight and are sparing on battery\nconsumption, whereas the LED screens\nof Apple devices chew through power\nand also make reading in locations outside\nliving rooms very tricky because of their\nglare-prone screens.\nThe iBooks store on the iPad does come\nwith the advantage that you can select the\nfont size, which is ideal for the average e-reader demographic (high earning 34-55\nyear olds according to TechCrunchies) who\nare beginning to \u201csee\u201d their eyesight failing\nthem. Then there is the obvious advantage of having thousands of titles at your\ndisposal and all packed into a few cubic\ninches of metal and plastic.\nAre real books simply better?\nPerhaps it is because the majority of book buyers are the Baby\nBoomers, now all over sixty. This older age demographic is less\nlikely to buy e-readers: with their approaching retirement it is\nlikely that the Boomers will buy even more books with more time\non their hands, thus potentially slowing the predicted demise of\nprinting.\nThe hefty price tags on any of these readers (bar the Kindle) also\nmake them a luxury afforded only by the well-off. After spending upwards of $200 on an e-reader you do not even benefit from\nbuying books at reduced prices \u2013 you pay the same for e-books as\nyou do paper books so there isn\u2019t really any chance of recouping\nyour investment.\nThere has been much talk and excitement over the possibilities of e-readers being used for educational purposes, but reading\nfrom a screen may even inhibit note taking and retention. Last\nautumn, students at Ivy League Princeton rejected a Kindle pilot\nprogram for academic titles on those grounds.\nTheir practicality for use by anyone under 16 or so is pretty low\nand I doubt any e-reader can give to a small child any of the joy\nthat a large, brightly coloured picture book with chewable paper\npages does.\nPerhaps the reason why I will never be buying an e-reader is the\ntrouble I have reading off screens which are extremely tiring on\nthe eyes and also a lot less immersive. Somehow words on a screen\nseem less real, more abstract, than ink on paper. One can connect\nmore with a book you feel the pages of in your hand. With an e-reader you do not get that feeling of accomplishment as you see\nthe pages left to read dwindling as you approach the end. Reading\nreal books also differentiate your reading experience from simply trawling the internet from your mobile or reading emails and\ntexts.\nNext is the issue of environmental impact. Printed\nmedia apparently costs us 125,000 trees per year.\nE-readers may save paper but because manufacturers have not revealed how resource-intensive their\ngadgets are to produce and ship, their environmentally friendly rating has been hard to estimate.\nThere is also the electricity used to keep them\ncharged which doesn\u2019t come without its own share\nof CO2 emissions.\nBooks are not simply the sum of the information\nand words they contain. They can be a collector\u2019s\nitem, an antique. They look pleasing and satisfying on your shelf; a physical representation of your\njourney through literature. The feel of the actual\nbook and how the pages turn completely affect the\nreading experience and nothing beats the musty\nsmell of second hand books (a very much acquired\ntaste).\nBooks don\u2019t mind if you spill tea on them. Nor\ndo they mind the occasional blim-burn. The blank\npages at the book\u2019s front and back do wonderfully\nin toilet paper emergencies.\nYes, 145,000 titles available in e-format on Amazon is staggering and probably more than any person can read in a lifetime, yet there are still many\nmultiples more available in paper.\nOne still sees an overwhelming majority of paper books on planes, tubes and trains. Yes, it is a\nnice thought that you are carrying around a small\nlibrary in your pocket but books are not like music,\nit is not that beneficial to have more than a couple\non your person at any given time: you tend to read\nonly one book per (tube) journey whereas with\nsongs, it is now almost crucial that we can shuffle about among thousands of tracks at a press\nof a button.\nAfter we have finished reading an e-book\nthere is no option of passing it from friend to\nfriend or re-selling it to earn a bit of money.\nWe can\u2019t spend a rainy afternoon wandering between the shelves of a bookstore,\nreading the books for free with e-books.\nNumbers of e-readers sold thus far vary\nhugely and are very inconsistent with one\nfigure claiming that 22m were shipped in\n2009, yet another estimating that only 6m\nwill be sold in 2010. No doubt, technological progress (no matter how redundant)\nis essential but I still don\u2019t have to like it.\nI feel sad when I hear that printing will\none day be dead. When I am old will I have\nto switch to e-readers against my will? Or\nwill I have to spend hours hunting for my\nchoice of titles in hard to come by second\nhand bookshops? Let us hope not.\nPlain old paper?\n\n"

Apparently\nthis is Noel Clarke\u2019s response to recent\ncriticism of the lack of convincing female parts in his films. I hate to imagine the carnage caused by him and Jo\nBrand crossing paths.\nClarke is the currently the darling of\ngrimey British drama after the highly\nsuccessful Kidulthood and Adulthood\nfilms but his latest offering is a move\ntowards a more stylish thriller and he\nfails miserably. The grittiness is replaced by the oh so fashionable fast\npaced editing and a headache inducing\nstory structure.\n\u20184 girls, 3 days, 2 cities, 1 chance\u2019\nstates the movie\u2019s tag line if it\u2019s title\nwas puzzling you. The immaculately\nbonneted Tasmin Egerton plays the\nconfident Cassandra, a wealthy piano\nvirtuoso who spends her free time\nat Westfield with her friends Kerrys (Shanika Warren-Markland), the\naforementioned sassy Brazilian lesbian\nand Joanne, a homesick American who\nhas found herself working in a convenience store. Ophelia Lovibond completes the quartet as Shannon who is a\ntroubled girl because she wears a parka\nand too much eyeliner.\nWe are briefly introduced to the girls\nand made aware of a diamond heist\nbefore being whisked away to follow\neach characters separate adventures\nover the next three days. This is where\nthe film falls apart. We first experience Shannon\u2019s three days courtesy of\na cameraman with Alzheimer\u2019s. The\nhandheld camera is in vogue these\ndays but it is used so excruciatingly\nbadly that it\u2019s jittery nature only emphasises the confusion of the plot.\nBy time the story moves onto Shannon, the audience is completely clueless about the film and likely disinterested as a result. Shannon quickly loses\nher clothes in New York and her part in\nthe film seems solely to look fantastic\nin underwear. Kerrys\u2019 section is no better and her \u2018You go girl!\u2019 attitude is just\n4.3.2.1 is a countdown for a big misfire\nDirector Mark Davis, Noel Clarke\nScreenwriter Noel Clarke\nCast Emma Roberts, Tamsin Egerton,\nOphelia Lovibond\n4.3.2.1.\nEdKnock\nEdKnock Film Editor\nADVERT\nSave the Children Society street collection\nWe had 14 volunteers, collecting between 10.30am\nand 6pm, outside\nthe Chelsea FC grounds on a match day.\nChief promoter \u2013 Mr Robin Pitt\nPromoter \u2013 Miss Lauren Waterman\nType of fundraiser \u2013 Bucket Collection with Street\nCollection Permit\nArea \u2013 Hammersmith & Fulham\nCharity \u2013 Save the Children UK (Charity number\n213890)\nDate of collection \u2013 27th March 2007\nAmount collected and distributed to the charity\n- \u00a3683.24\nExpenses incurred - \u00a30 (volunteers paid their own\ntravel expenses)\na shameless excuse for some steamy\nsex scenes with her girlfriend.\nIt\u2019s only in the final quarter of the\nfilm does the film\u2019s plot resemble any\ncohesion. The very loosely interwoven\nstory lines miss any of the subtle effectiveness of similar alternative plot\nstructures like Memento.\nThe cast\u2019s performances are aver-age, which isn\u2019t helped by an ordinary\nscript.

You ready?\nSimon Worthington looks at 3D TV and what it means for you\nT\nhe age of the red-and-blue\ngrainy clich\u00e9 is over! Cast\naside your cheap cardboard\nspectacles and make way for\na new era of unparalleled 3D realism\naccompanied by spectacular picture\nquality. However, instead of overpriced\ncinema screenings the revolution is\ngoing to happen right in your front\nroom, changing the televisions and\nvideo games we know and love for ever.\nAt least, that\u2019s what television manufacturers would like us to believe, as\nthey prepare a fresh wave of new \u20183Dready\u2019 screens for release throughout\nthis year and next. But as with any new\ntechnology, consumers are left with\nvery big questions that need answer-ing. Where has this new 3D technology come from? What will I need, and\nhow much will it cost? Is there going to\nbe any trouble for early adopters? Is it\nreally worth it?\nCoca-Cola trying out the same technique for a Super Bowl commercial as\nearly as 1989. More recently, Channel\n4\u2019s \u20183D Week\u2019 showed documentaries\nand images of the Queen in 3D using\npairs of the classic red-and-blue cardboard glasses.\nThe difference this time around\nhowever is that the television industry is now focussing on \u2018real 3D\u2019 that\ndoesn\u2019t distort images or ruin colours.\nThe current idea is to send different\ntelevision images to each eye directly\ninstead of filtering based on colour.\nThis has recently been made possible by improvements in television\nand broadcast technology. There are\nthree main approaches being used by\nmanufacturers referred to as \u2018passive\n3D\u2019, \u2018active 3D\u2019 and \u2018auto-stereoscopic\nviewing\u2019.\nare likely to set you back only\naround \u00a35-10 a pair. The\ndownside is a reduction in brightness\nand around about\n30% colour loss.\nAlternatively\nyou have active\n3D, also referred\nto as \u2018alternate\nframe sequencing\u2019,\nwhich uses a more\nhigh-tech set of glasses\nto create the 3D effect.\nEach pair of glasses has a\nliquid crystal display instead of a lens that, when a\nvoltage is applied across it,\nturns dark and opaque (us-ing the same idea as displaying numbers on a digital\nwatch). Pairs of glasses are\nsynchronised via infra-red\nor RF to the television that\ntells the glasses which eye\nshould be open and closed\nat any one time. This creates the desired 3D effect\nby ensuring individual\nframes can be sent to individual eyes. Active shutter technology is by far the\nmost popular choice with\nalmost every major TV manufacturer\nhaving a device in the marketplace using this technology meaning it\u2019s set to\nbecome the standard in some form for\n3D viewing. Both glasses and screens\nare quite expensive however, coming\nin at around \u00a32000 for a 46\u201d TV and\n\u00a360-100 for each pair of glasses.\nB\nam! The World Cup is here!\nYes, footballers from around\nthe world are set to do battle on the International stage.\nBut wait, how can you get all World\nCup all the time? The Beeb and ITV\nwill be doing an outstanding job I\u2019m\nsure, covering all angles on the TV, but\nwhat about when you\u2019re on the bus?\nTVcatchup.com is your best bet for\nlive streaming. It\u2019ll stream to your old\nand busted, or new and shiny iPhone\nno problem, even over 3G, so you\u2019ll\nnever miss a goal.\nCan\u2019t watch something, but still want\nmore? Well good, old fashioned radio\nis your next best bet. Radio 5 Live will\nbe covering most of the games, leaving\nyour hands free to do other things.\nLast but not least, there\u2019s the World\nCup apps; loads of em, for all smartphone platforms, so check them out.\niPhone 4-ing it\nin stereoscope\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nto read them. An interesting point is\nthat these discs can actually be used\non a standard 2D Blu-ray player without issue, so it may be prudent to start\nbuying new Blu-ray films in 3D as an\ninvestment for the three dimensional\nfuture.\nFromtheBigScreen\nFromtheBigScreen\nMost of us will now be pretty familiar\nwith the idea of watching 3D movies in\nacinemawithmanynotablefilmspush-ing beyond the use of 3D as a novelty\neffect and instead using the technology\nin a much more integral way. With the\nbox office success of films like Avatar,\nwhich was shown in both IMAX 3D\nand in regular cinema 3D, television\nmanufacturers are now bringing to\nmarket all their 3D prototypes to try\nand cash in on increased interest in\nviewing in the third dimension. In fact,\n3D television is not a new concept with\nbroadcasters like the BBC transmitting\n3D specials of Doctor Who in 1993 and\nPassiveorActive?\nPassiveorActive?\nMost of you will be at least be familiar with passive 3D, which is the same\nsystem that is used in cinemas. The\ntelevision display is \u2018polarised\u2019, only\nemitting light in a specific way, with\nviewers having to wear a set of glasses\nwhose lenses have also been \u2018polarised\u2019.\nPolarisation is changed on each successive frame and when viewing the\nprogramme through the glasses each\nframe is only seen by one eye. Hardware manufacturer LG has announced\nat least one display (the LD950) that\nwill use this approach. A lower price is\nthe primary benefit of this system, with\nsets costing up to \u00a3200 less than the\nother methods in use. The 3D glasses\nrequired are also relatively cheap and\nAuto-whatnow?\nAuto-whatnow?\nIf the prospect of donning an oversized\nset of specs is worrying you, auto-ster-eoscopic displays may have the answer.\nThese sets don\u2019t require any kind of accessory for the user to wear, instead using a lenticular sheet, or parallax bar-rier, to show the image across multiple\nviewing angles. With enough different\nangles each eye will receive a different\npicture and so observe a 3D effect.\nAuto-stereoscopic technology also\nholds the possibility of allowing viewers to quite literally tilt their head to\nsee behind an object on the screen, using a sufficiently large amount of data\nto present different images at different\nangles. However, the effect can cause a\nloss of picture quality and isn\u2019t as noticeable as the other methods.\nPhillips used this effect in their\nWOWvx product line as early as two\nyears ago, but they have since dropped\nthe range stating that they \u2018didn\u2019t want\nto enter a format war\u2019 over 3D technology standards. Most of the current\nofferings are aimed at advertisers, although the technology does seem to\nbe gaining use on portable devices. Hitachi will soon be the first to release a\n3D phone screen in Japan, whilst Nintendo announced that the next version\nof their popular hand-held games con-sole, the Nintendo 3DS (see what they\ndid there?), will use the effect.\nFormatwarimminent?\nFormatwarimminent?\nAs may be evident, there is currently\na lack of consensus in the television\nindustry as to which implementation\nof 3D TV viewing is best. Thankfully,\nSky TV have already announced their\n3D Sky+ box will work on all displays\nwithout worry. At the moment though,\neach manufacturer has it\u2019s own proprietary system for controlling glasses\nand polarisation. Not only may this\nlead to another format war of some\nkind (anyone remember HD-DVDs?),\nwhich is bad news for early adopters,\nbut it\u2019s also frustrating for consumers as it means glasses from different\ncompanies aren\u2019t compatible with each\nother.\nThe glasses issue is also a sticky sub-ject. Right since it\u2019s first broadcast,\nwatching television has been a social\nexperience with as many people able\nto watch as can be fit into the room. It\nmay be the case however, that 3D TV\nis set to mess with this stereotype requiring every viewer to adorn glasses,\nwhich in large families could get very\nexpensive very quickly. It also raises\nquestions over watching with friends,\nas anyone without a pair of glasses can\u2019t\ntake part in the 3D experience. Lack of\nstandards for glasses also means that\neven friends with their own glasses\ncould only watch if they have the same\nmodel of TV, or in some cases wear the\nglasses upside down.\n3Dmoviesathome\n3Dmoviesathome\nTo get a full 3D experience for films in\nthe home you\u2019ll also need a new Bluray player. Normal discs aren\u2019t set up\nin the right way to handle 3D content\nand so there has recently been the introduction of 3D Blu-ray discs, which\nrequire a compatible 3D Blu-ray player\nButwhatcanIwatchin3D?\nButwhatcanIwatchin3D?\nEven after shelling out for your new\ntelevision, new glasses, new Blu-ray\nplayer and new Sky+ box, you may\nstill struggle to actually watch any 3D\ncontent at all. Although Sky have now\nlaunched their dedicated 3D channel\nthey have said that it was a \u2018difficult\u2019\nprocess, mainly due to a \u2018lack of 3D\ncontent\u2019. The fact is that apart from a\nfew films (be prepared to watch Monsters Vs. Aliens a lot) and a smattering\nof 3D channels that tend to show live\nsport, there isn\u2019t actually all that much\navailable to watch in 3D. Making 3D\nprogramming is still a difficult process.\nStudios need to upgrade nearly all of\ntheir equipment if they want to make\n3D shows, and so it will probably still\nbe a long time before there is significant quantity of things to watch using\nyour new 3D television.\nGiven the high set-up costs, lack of\nprogramming and the possible destruction of what little social interaction families have left, it\u2019s hard to see\nwhy anyone would want to bother with\n3D television. Certainly, for the average consumer the time has probably\nnot yet come, to make the change to\n3D, but early adopters will be suitably\nimpressed by the \u2018wow\u2019 factor that 3D\nbrings. In time, all TVs will support 3D\nnaturally, like nearly all new displays\nsupport HD now. With this in mind, a\nthree-dimensional television could be\na sound investment. At any rate, the\nmessage from the television industry is\nclear: 3D TV is here to stay.\nare likely to\naround\ndow\nti\nw\nhig\nto cre\nEach p\nliquid\nstead o\nvoltage\nturns d\ning the s\ning num\nwatch).\nsynchro\nor RF t\ntells th\nshould\nat any\nates th\nby en\nframes\ndividua\nte\nt r tech\nmost p\nalmost every majo\nhaving a device in\ni hi h l\nThen check out this Sunday\u2019s\nepisode of the Wrap Sheet\npodcast talking iPhone 4,\niOS4 and everything in\nbetween.\nAvailable\nfree on\niTunes,\nFacebook\nor the blog\nwww.thewrapsheet.co.uk\nNeed more\niPhone 4?\n\n"

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 11 JUNE 2010\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICAL COMMENT\nO\nnce again, Israel finds itself in the middle of\ninternational outrage with the fallout from\nthe Mavi Marmara confrontation. Nations\naround the world unsheathed their Israelbashing baton once again. True, the shooting of the 9 activists was appalling, brutal and an excessive\nshow of force. But is Israel all to blame for the way the events\nunfolded?\nFree Gaza Movement is the umbrella group behind the\nFreedom Flotilla, of which the Mavi Marmara was one\npart. The group sends aid ships to Gaza as a form of protest against the Gaza blockade. Three of their previous aid\nships have successfully reached Gaza so far. Their mission\nmanifesto cites nonviolent action in their effort to break the\nGaza blockade.\nHowever the footage of the vicious mob wielding metal\nrods and chairs, hammering the Israeli commandos in a\nmanner reminiscent of a seal cull and throwing one of them\noverboard is unsettling, especially aboard a supposedly\npeaceful ship, as assumed by the Israeli patrols.\nThe Mavi Marmara is owned by IHH, an Islamic charity accused of funding terrorist activities. Israel claims that\nthe aggressors aboard the ship had intentions other than a\npeaceful civil disobedience. Some of them were suspected\nmercenaries, based on the large amount of cash found on\nthem. Israel even goes to the extent of accusing the hand of\nal-Qaeda in the incident. Turkey shot the claim down, stating that no such presence could bypass the security checks\nat the Turkish docks. They also said that they could not\nhave secretly boarded the ship, as the Mavi Marmara only\nstopped at Cyprus for the boarding of two German MPs and\nEuropean activists.\nAccounts from both sides on who initiated the aggression\nare starkly different. The perpetrators of the confrontation\nis still unknown. Activists claimed that Israeli forces sprayed\nbullets on unarmed passengers. The IDF claimed that the\ncommandos shot in self-defence. The video circulating online leans towards Israel\u2019s version of the story (note that it\nwas released by the IDF). The five other vessels in the flotilla\nthat followed Mavi Marmara were intercepted peacefully.\nFree Gaza Movement could have done more to ensure that\nthe Freedom Flotilla was an act of defiance in accordance\nwith their nonviolence pledge. Why a group of men previously braced for violence on-board a supposedly peaceful\nvessel raises questions. Was Free Gaza Movement sincerely\nignorant of their presence? Or more troubling, did they\nknow but tolerate it because it helped them towards their\nultimate goal of breaking the blockade.\nThe aim of the Freedom Flotilla was clear. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to\nbreak the blockade of the Gaza Strip and tell the world that\nIsrael has no right to starve 1.5 million Palestinians,\u201d said\nGreta Berlin, head of the Free Gaza Movement, before the\nFreedom Flotilla departed.\nThe Mavi Marmara was offered the chance to unload its\naid materials at Ashdod, but refused to do so. It was evident\nwhere its priority lies when it comes to delivering aid to the\nGazans or delivering a political message.\nThe deaths of nine of the activists at the hands of the Israeli commandos certainly threw the Gaza blockade once\nagain in the international stage and reinforced the pressure\non Israel to lift the siege.\nHowever, would increasing worldwide pressure cause Israel to buckle and lift the blockade? Perhaps demonizing Israel would cause it to withdraw more into itself and become\nmore uncooperative as it perceives the outside world to be\nunsympathetic to its own security needs (one of the aims of\nthe blockade was to stem flow of arms into Hamas)?\nOn the other hand, Israel\u2019s impetuous use of force makes\nit easy for its opponents to turn the sympathy of the world\u2019s\nwatchers against it. Israel\u2019s enemies knew that the Achilles\nheel of the middle-eastern powerhouse is its shaky international relations and that is where they strike. Israel has\na reputation of being hawkish and, to some countries, the\nperception is that Israel thinks itself above international law.\nThe Netanyahu administration\u2019s defiance of US requests\nto halt the settlement expansion in East Jerusalam before\nthe Israeli-Palestinian proximity talks casts doubt on Israel\u2019s\ncommitment to the peace progress. Israel\u2019s attempt to sway\nChina into voting for a sanction against Iran by showing\nChina the impact of a pre-emptive Israeli strike on Iran \u2013\nshould the UN fail to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear activities \u2013 on the\noil supply of China, reinforces Israel\u2019s maverick reputation.\nIsrael constantly resorts to the self-defence argument to\njustify its use of force. The bombardment of Gaza in January\n2009 brought Hamas\u2019 trigger happy rocket firing into southern Israel to a halt, though at the cost of many Palestinians\nlives and souring of international relations. Often, Israel is\ncaught in a Catch-22 situation.\nThe flotilla tragedy also brings to light the efficiency of\nbold and radical activism. The Mavi Marmara may have\nhighlighted the Gaza blockade, but in doing so, has disrupted a lot of possibility for peace. Preference for Hamas\nwas reportedly faltering in Gaza, but the incident could rally\nsupport for Hamas. Israel stands to lose its only Muslim\nally, Turkey, and with it a lot of clout to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear\nambition.\nOn the other hand, it forced Israel to accept Britain\u2019s suggestion to water down the blockade, in exchange for being\nallowed to run its own inquiry into the incident instead of\nthe international inquisition demanded by the UN. Peace\nactivists hope that help from the US in dampening the condemnation by the international community would come at\na price \u2013 Israel\u2019s cooperation in future peace efforts \u2013 as\nthe Obama administration is more reluctant to defend Israel unconditionally.\nThe Freedom Flotilla champions a righteous cause. But its\norganizers need to ensure that malicious forces do not deviate the ships from their objectives: a non-violent display of\ncivil disobedience to break the Gaza blockade.\nA week after the flotilla fiasco, Israel killed 4 Palestinian\ndivers suspected of being militants. The Iranian Red Cross\nwould be sending two aid ships to Gaza, in light of the flotilla incident. The world waits for Israel\u2019s reaction.\nRelaxing its hawkish inclination would help Israel make\nmore friends, and so reinforce its security. In a hawk-dove\ngame, playing hawk does not always garner the best payoffs.\nA bungled affair\nWere the intentions of the Free Gaza Movement completely\ninnocent, and are their efforts really helping those suffering in\nPalestine? By Guo Heng Chin\n\u201cPerhaps demonizing\nIsrael would cause it\nto withdraw more into\nitself and become more\nuncooperative\u201d\n\u201cIsrael claims that the\naggressors aboard the ship\nhad intentions other than a\npeaceful civil disobedience.\u201d\n\n"

You see, I am a noted\nviolator of the accepted laws of logic.\nSome of the greatest minds in the field\nhave tried to persuade me to see oth-erwise, but I simply kan\u2019t.

What a horrendously snobbish observation to make.\nDo us both a favour and forget I ever\nmentioned it.\nThe received wisdom (ha! Chalk\nthat one up alongside \u2018military intelligence\u2019 and \u2018compassionate conservatism\u2019 as one of the great oxymorons of\nthe age) is that haughtiness is a oneway street. That the omnibuses of social hierarchy must follow each other\nin single file along the boulevards of\ncondescension.\nHow wrong these received sages are.\nSnobbery is the great social rounda-bout, where every traveller both follows and precedes every other, depending only on their choice of exit.\nIn general, of course, snobbery is perceived to be a question of birthright,\nbreeding, and bank balance. Despite\nthis view\u2019s preponderance, arrogance\nand hauteur are by no means the sole\nprerogative of the privileged classes.\nSnobs, as I\u2019m sure we are all aware, exist all along the social sliderule.\nThe intricately balanced and scrupulously maintained laws of below stairs\netiquette in the past century\u2019s grandest houses would have caused a blush\nof shame to mantle their lords\u2019 and ladies\u2019 cheeks. A housemaid would never dream of eating at the same table\nas a household butler, while the very\nthought of an under-footman sharing\na meal with the housekeeper would be\nenough to make one swoon.\nFortunately such days are long gone,\nand it is now difficult to fool oneself\ninto believing that education and\nbreeding determine one\u2019s place in\nsociety. Inequalities still abound, of\ncourse, but the great levelling of society has made snobbery, like M.C.\nEscher\u2019s famous two-handed sketch,\na self-perpetuating illusion. The fifth\nson of an earl is only grander than the\nsecond husband of an IT consultant if\nboth parties believe him to be so. Society itself will certainly not be drawn\non the issue.\nBut we all know that humans are intrinsically tribal and hierarchical beings\u2014we continue to divide ourselves\ninto groups, classes, cliques, fellow-ships, fraternities, organisations and\nclubs at every opportunity that arises.\nWe all yearn to make snap judgements\nof others based on whatever aspect of\ntheir character catches the eye.\nAs a result, the emphasis has shifted\nincreasingly towards the more pernicious snobbery associated with culture and the arts: an attempt to make\nartistic appreciation an exclusive\nrather than an inclusive activity. And\nthis in my books, much like the Mona\nLisa, is a hanging offence.\nIn my capacity as a sometime writer\nand alltime reader, my reaction to\nthose who have not yet sailed on the\nsame literary cruises as myself is to\nrush out and buy them first class tick-ets. What good is it to have touched\na distant vista if you have nobody to\nshare the moment with?\nThe same applies to those (fortu-nately numerous) friends of mine who\nare imponderably more familiar than\nI am with works of visual and musical composition. I am always struck by\nhow those with a genuine excuse for\nsnobbery \u2013 those with talent, training\nor technical skill \u2013 are most excited at\nthe thought of welcoming an outsider\ninto their world. And how it is often\nthose who are resentful and unsure in\ntheir own abilities who are capable of\nthe most damning sneers.\nSo rejoice in your ignorance - not\nas a terminal condition, but as the\nblank sheet that must once have preceded the opening bars of Beethoven\u2019s\nninth symphony. And if you catch me\nlooking down my nose at you, judge\nnot too harshly \u2013 when you\u2019re 6 foot\n3 there isn\u2019t much else you can look\ndown to make eye contact. Except,\nperhaps, a telescope.\n\u201cI am always struck\nby how those with\na genuine excuse\nfor snobbery are\noften the most\nwelcoming\u201d\nNathan Holford responds on social inequality\nI\nn the 6th Century, when the\nAnglo-Saxons captured the city\nof Londinium, a small river, the\nWalbrook, ran gently through\nthe middle of the settlement,\nproviding water, sanitation and transport for its residents. The invading\nforce chose to make their home on the\nwest side of this river, separating themselves from the native Celts by forcing\nthem to inhabit the east.\nToday, that river runs secretly from\nFinsbury Park, through culverts un-derground, to freedom through a small\ngrate, into the Thames by Cannon\nStreet tube station, yet that arbitrary\ndivide remains one-and-a-half millennia later. The West End is one of the\ncleanest City districts in Europe and,\nthough every estate agent would hasten to point out that it\u2019s \u2018up and coming\u2019, the East is still worse off.\nFirstly, I\u2019d like to point out that positive discrimination (or positive action\nas it\u2019s been re-dubbed) categorically\ndoes not force employers to hire a less\nable over a more able candidate simply\nbecause of their gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity. That just wouldn\u2019t\nmake any sense. For simplicity, I\u2019m going to focus on gender. Say a FTSE 100\ncompany have a high-level vacancy to\nfill; they find two candidates ideal for\nthe job, one man and one woman. On\naverage, these companies employ one\nwoman for every nine men in such\npositions, so positive action gives the\ncompany a legal right to employ the\nwoman over the man in order to better\nrepresent women within upper echelons of the business. Does it \u2018undermine pride\u2019 to be given a job because\nyou\u2019re what the company wants? No. I\ndidn\u2019t think so.\nDuring its recent investigation of\nthe financial sector, the Treasury published a report entitled \u2018Women in the\nCity\u2019 which went so far as to suggest\nthat gender inequality in finance may\nhave contributed to the global financial\ncrisis. Now, the Equality Commission\npredicts that it will take another 40\nyears before women see fair representation in the Square Mile, and, interest-ingly, 200 years before the same happens in Westminster. And that\u2019s with\ncurrent measures of positive action.\nLooking at our parliament, about\n20% of our MPs are female. 15 MPs\naren\u2019t white when there should be 60 if\npeople were to be represented propor-tionally. The way potential parliamentary candidates are selected varies from\n\u201cPositive\ndiscrimination\ndoes not force\nemployers to hire\nless competent\ncandidates\u201d\nparty to party, but the general case is\nthat a centrally approved list is handed\non to the local party for them to vote\nwhoever they want to be represented\nby. Now, perhaps I\u2019m biased about this,\nbut let\u2019s focus on the Conservative\nParty for a second\u2014they were, after all,\nthe most popular at the last election.\nImagine one of their meetings in, say,\nHenley-upon-Thames. Old boys and a\nfew Edwina Currie look-a-likes, bumbling about with glasses of port, nibbling on cheese from Paxton & Whitfield, lamenting \u2018political correctness\ngone mad\u2019 and the quality of driving\ntests in Poland. They get handed a list\nof people they can choose to represent\nthem. Who they gonna choose?\nIn 1996, 4 out of 60 Welsh MPs were\nwomen. By introducing positive discrimination for the 1999 elections,\nthe Welsh Assembly became the first\nlegislative body in the world to have\ntrue representation of women. For\nthe following election, no positive action was taken and female representation remained virtually unchanged at\n47%. Similar methods have been used\nin Denmark, where 38% of the seats\nin parliament are held by women. No\none\u2019s suggesting that positive action\nshould be a permanent measure, but\ninstead of waiting for society to crawl\nits way to inevitable change, why not\ngive it a helping hand along the way?\nThe gender gap has a lot in common\nwith the Walbrook: the line of separa-tion, though long vanished, still has\nan enduring effect on society. But if\nwe build homes for everyone, on each\nside of the river, we might just see some\nlong-overdue change.\n\n"

The consultants care\nabout how they appear to their patient.\nIt\u2019s the first point of judgement, and\nthus the first point at which the patient\ndecides whether this is a doctor they\nbelieve will make them better.\nClearly a doctor with a smart, well\nput-together student standing behind\nthem looks better than a scuffed, unshaven mug with a battered notepad,\ntripping over his shoelace.\nI mean, who would you prefer?\nAnd the theory transfers to all corners of any professional industry. People are judgemental. All this rubbish\nabout \u201cinner beauty\u201d is irrelevant in\nthe interview setting.

It\u2019s my b\u00eate noire,\nespecially as a student at an institution\nsuch as Imperial, where it seems that\ntaste and fashion are utterly superfluous concepts to most students.\nAnd yet, every now and then, I see\na fellow style-maven cross my path.

(of a woman) curvaceous\nand sexually attractive. This, ladies\nand gentleman, is Joan Holloway. With\nclassic pin-up beauty \u2013 porcelain skin,\nblue almandine eyes and full lips \u2013 she\nis the queen bee office manager of Sterling Cooper, ruling over rows of typing\nsecretaries with a sweet smile and a\nknowing eye. Her mere presence steals\nhours\u2019 worth of stares wherever she\ngoes, her undulating Titian-red curls\nbouncing to the rhythm of her swingy,\nconfident step \u2013 the walk of a woman\nfully aware of her devastating effect\non anyone with a Y chromosome. Her\nmantra: if you want the girl next door,\nyou should go next door.\nHer shape is triumphantly feminine\n\u2013 rounded edges, curves where they\nought to be: she is the essence of what\nit is to be a woman. As such, her style\nwould appeal only to those designers who adore and worship the female\nform: Alber Elbaz, Roland Mouret,\nDolce & Gabbana. Her dresses and\nskirt suits hug every corner, (you understand finally what the body-con-scious movement was all about) defined by the classic, high 1960s waist,\nand in confident jewel brights \u2013 cherry\nred, emerald green, cobalt blue \u2013 not\na taupe or oatmeal to be seen. She is\nmodest too; skirts fall to the knee,\ncleavage is a rarity \u2013 too easy \u2013 and\nheels climb only to an unassuming 2\u201d.\nCompared to Betty Draper, (wife of\nmain character Don) the Grace Kellyesque ice queen housewife with endless hours to preen and primp herself into picture-perfection, always\nin wasp-waisted pastels, pearls and a\nprim cardi, Joan is a warm, savvy career girl. Her work uniform serves\nmore as asset-management than anything else \u2013 for she does have assets\nany woman would be proud of \u2013 and\nher taste and style is the envy of all the\nwomen in the office. Seductive without\nbeing obvious, she is the office femme\nfatale, but at the same time, a world-wise big sister to the other girls of the\noffice, the only one amongst them who\nis respected amongst both the male\nand female staff.\nIn an episode in the second season,\neach secretary is categorised as either\na Marilyn Monroe or a Jackie Kennedy\nin a campaign for Playtex.

Joan is a thirtysome-thing woman torn between her desire\nto be a comfortably married woman\nand her disgust at the prospect of instead becoming a bored housewife.\nHer independent spirit coupled with\nthe misogynistic times leaves Joan in\na something of a quandary; but with\na fabulously written script filled with\ncutting one-liners, she is nothing less\nthan a joy to watch.\nThis is Woman: what Plato would\nhave called his Form; what Jung would\nhave called his Archetype. Yes, it\nwould seem that I have an uncontrollable crush on the woman. Well, so\ndoes everyone else. She is beautiful,\nconfident, emotionally fraught and not\nwithout her fair share of knocks in life,\nbut with such infectious joie de vivre\nthat she is difficult not to love.\nAnna Wintour didn\u2019t get to where she is today wearing scuffed shoes\n\n"

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 11 JUNE 2010\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBlair\u2019s 50% targets scrapped as Higher Ed gets revamp\nL\niberal Democrat business\nsecretary Vince Cable has\nopted for a revamp of Further and Higher Education,\nresulting in the government\nconsidering cutting the amount of students going to University. Tony Blair\nand the previous government had a\ntarget of putting 50% of young people\nthrough University, but Cable remains\nsceptical that increasing the number\nof students is a good thing.\nAdding actual cuts to University\nplaces after the coalition\u2019s move to\nfund 10,000 fewer places than promised under Labour (as reported on by\nfelix last week) will fuel more anger\nfrom critics, students and staff alike.\nThe Guardian reports a source close\nto Cable said that \u201cthere needs to be\na big national debate between excellence and quality on the one hand\nand bums on seats on the other hand.\nPacking more and more students in is\nnot necessarily good value for money.\u2019\u2019\nAaron Porter, president of the National Union of Students, has expressed his concerns that this move\nwould \u2018\u2019jeopardise the fragile economic recovery and place us at risk of\nreturning to a Higher Education system accessible only to a liberal elite.\u2019\u2019\nThere appears to be much agreement\nwith this view, with France and the\nUS investing more in their Universities. Sally Hunt, general secretary of\nthe University and College Union approved of the idea of a debate on the\nfuture of Universities, but slammed\nBritain\u2019s chances in the \u201cglobal knowledge economy\u2019\u2019 if funding or student\nparticipation continues to reduce,\nstating that she \u201ccannot see how denying thousands the chance to fulfil their\npotential at university and increasing the strain on the benefits system\nwould be in this country\u2019s interest\u2019\u2019.\nWith both parties of the coalition\ngovernment appearing to find the\ncurrent system unsustainable, major overhauls are expected. Cable\nis strongly aligned towards putting\nmore money into vocational training and Further Education in order to\nbreak down the perceived elitism of\nUniversity education. In times where\nstudents, the general public and employers alike may compare degrees\nfrom one University with another, the\nquestion that remains to be asked is\nthe extent of disruption which may\noccur if the degree classification system was changed.

Normally\nI enjoy the mindless humour however I found this\nparticularly distasteful. As I am originally from\nCumbria the shooting referred to in this column is\nsomething I am particularly sensitive about. I personally feel that there is a fine line between dark\nhumour and distasteful and here a line has been\ncrossed.\nAs editor I think it is your responsibility to be\naware of where this line is and what may offend\nstudents reading your paper. Surely it must have\noccurred to you that some students may even\nbe from Whitehaven, or Agremont or any of the\nmany other communities that has been shocked\nby the horrific events that occurred just two days\nbefore the \u201cjokes\u201d about these were published in\nour paper.\nTo add insult to injury you clearly didn\u2019t deem\nthe event as important enough to feature in any\n\u2018news\u2019 section of the paper , I can\u2019t help but ques-Twatter crossed a dark line tion an editor who deems it enough to put two\nlines of sarcastic jokes about a cereal killing but\nneglects to write it as any sort of news.\nRuth Patchett\nEditor-in-Chief Dan Wan responds:\nI can only apologise for any upset we have caused\nwith last week\u2019s issue. We obviously do not intend\nto offend anyone, and you rightly say there is a fine\nline between satire, dark humour and just plain\ndistasteful. I will admit that last week\u2019s Twatter\nstraddles that line, and is a result of a misjudgment\non where exactly the joke lay.\nRegarding the lack of mention in the News sec-tion, this section tend to focus on matters surrounding Imperial College. Every week, there are national\nand international occurrences. Unfortunately we\ncannot provide coverage to it all. I hope you can\nunderstand that the unfortunate events that unfolded in Cumbria last week would probably have\nnot been covered in a paper with such a select target\naudience.\nI hope you can accept our apologies.\ndegree from Imperial is more attractive to employers. Roger Brown, professor of the Higher Education policy\nat Liverpool Hope has since recommended scrapping the 200 year old\ntradition of awarding firsts, 2:1s and\n2:2s due to the classifications prolonging \u2018\u2019the pretence that a degree from\none university can be compared with\none from another university.\u2019\u2019\nThe Comparability Of Degree\nStandards report warns that it is\n\u201cimpossible\u2019\u2019 to compare one University with another. As pressures mount\nfrom the \u00a31.2billion cuts from University budgets up until 2013, the report\nargues that there is a risk that they are\nmore likely to \u201ccut corners\u2019\u2019, mentioning that Universities would be less\nlikely to award students higher marks\nthan deserved if classifications were\ndropped. Brown suggested the alternative of awarding transcripts and a\ngeneral statement of students\u2019 abili-ties, a system currently being trialled\nin some Universities.\nBrown continued to explain that \u201cat\nthe moment, if a University decides it\nis going to change the rules, there is\nno mechanism that would alert anyone to this. We urgently need to look\nat this\u2019\u2019, further suggesting that panels\nof academics can\nbe sent to deduce\nwhether the content\nof courses and the\nquality of teaching\nare up to minimum\nstandards. An internal E-mail from\nManchester Metropolitan University\nwas leaked two years ago showing\ntheir staff being urged to increase the\namount of top marks in order to remain in good competition with rival\nUniversities. Some high profile cases\nhave arisen since, including Universities such as Bournemouth. At present,\nImperial targets 70% of students\nreaching a 2:1 or better, but only 57%\nhave done so. In Mathematics BSc/\nMSc, only 21% of graduates achieved\na first class degree, with 36% reaching\na 2:1.\nfelix previously reported on the \u201c2:1\nfloor\u2019\u2019 which appears to be unanimously adopted by employers, where\n2:1 degrees are considered preliminary\nrequirements for securing employ-ment. Should the government proceed with not only their overhauls, but\nalso adopt reclassification of degrees\nor removal of the current system, the\n\u201c2:1 floor\u2019\u2019 would essentially be lifted,\ngranting students more perceived security in graduate prospects after University. This may result in more students applying and the dissolution of\nthe elitist image of Higher Education.\nThe prior felix article invited comments arguing for the respectability\nof 2:2 class degrees and their potential academic equivalence to \u201cat least\na 2:1 from many institutions\u2019\u2019, further\ndescribing Imperial\u2019s unwavering\nopposition to the \u201cdegree inflation\nphenomenon.\u2019\u2019\nBrown\u2019s report, however, argues the\nfurther impossibility of comparing\ndegrees from Oxbridge to other Universities due to \u201cthe extraordinarily\nhigh previous educational attainment\nof students, the substantially greater\nresources devoted to them, the greater\nintensity of study that they undergo,\nand other factors\u2019\u2019, further adding that\n\u201cit would in fact be a surprise if the\noutcomes of students from those universities were no higher than those of\nstudents from other universities who\nhave far lower prior attainment and\nresources devoted to them.\u2019\u2019\nDirector general of the Russell\nGroup, Dr Wendy Piatt, commented\nthat their priority was to \u201censure the\nquality of Higher Education was main-tained, rather than expanding numbers\u2019\u2019 and added that they \u201cwould be\nconcerned about any proposals which\nfail to address the problem of under\nfunding of teaching for home students\nin the UK\u2019\u2019.\nAlex Karapetian\nAlex Karapetian\nProfessor Roger\nBrown suggested\nthat disparity in\ndegree quality\nfrom different\nuniversities mean\nthat awarding\nthe traditional\nhonours system\nis outdated\n\n"

Not only are there\nseven stages with music constantly\nfrom around 6pm to 5am on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday (leaving\nmost of the day for sleeping and enjoying the wonderful sights and tastes\nof Barcelona), but there are bands\nat other venues around the city on\nWednesday and Sunday too, including\nfree gigs by Real Estate, the King Khan\n& BBQ show, and Dum Dum Girls\nin the Joan Miro park; and a closing\nparty with Jeffrey Lewis and the Black\nLips at the Apollo.\nNever before have I seen a festival line up full of bands I either really wanted to see, or hadn\u2019t heard of\n(and most of those were the Spanish\nbands). To name a few, Pixies, Pavement, Broken Social Scene, The Fall,\nBuilt to Spill, CocoRosie, Best Coast,\nJapandroids, No Age, Grizzy Bear,\nDum Dum Girls, Jeffrey Lewis, Black\nLips, Beach House, Atlas Sound, Ganglians, Wire, Liquid Liquid, Fuck Buttons, Health, Orbital, Panda Bear, The\nXX, Les Savy Fav, The Big Pink, Surfer\nAlex Ashford\nAlex Ashford Music Editor\nMusic Editor\nBlood, Harlem, Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry,\nand so on and on and on. Each night\nwas rounded up by live performances\nand DJ sets from electro heavyweights\nlike Diplo, Fake Blood, and the Bloody\nBeetroots.\nMy fondest memory of the festival will undoubtedly be standing on a\ngrassy hill, overlooking uncountable\nthousands of people and dancing nonstop seeing Pixies. Pixies are a band I\ngot into when I was around 14 or 15,\nat that time when your friends would\nlet you burn a CD they got from their\nolder brother and it was music like\nyou\u2019d never heard before, something\ntotally different from the UK garage\nand American pop of the radio, something that blew your little teenage\nmind. Pixies are one of the few bands\nI liked then and over the years, I\u2019ve\nonly grown to like them more. Kurt\nCobain is often quoted as saying he\n\u201cwas basically trying to rip off the Pixies.\u201d Every song they played was a Pixies classic, from \u201cWhere is My Mind?\u201d\nto \u201cDebaser\u201d as well as covers of the\nJesus & Mary Chain and Neil Young\u2019s\n\u201cWinterlong\u201d. They may now be in\ntheir mid-forties but they can still play\nwith the togetherness and quality they\nare renowned for, and the enthusiasm\nthat can only come from being under\nthe radar enough to have never created\nthe dangerous rock-star egos that sadly\nhappen to so many other bands.\nIf you have heard of CocoRosie, I\nwould absolutely recommend that you\nsee them live. Music that on record is\nquiet, delicate, and beautifully surreal-istic, when heard live in person is like\nfalling down a rabbit hole and becoming completely immersed in booming\nunearthly landscapes of melodies and\nhip-hop beats as Bianca and Sierra\nCasady float energetically around the\nstage. The benchmark of indie bands:\nBroken Social Scene was as wonderful\nas my nostalgia could have hoped. I\ndidn\u2019t think I would, but I dived right\nin to the arty indie-pop euphoria of it,\ndancing around and singing my heart\nout. A few hours later, Stephen Malkmus took to the main stage and the\nband that Broken Social Scene owe so\nmuch of their sound to, early 90s lo-fi\npioneers Pavement, played their fuzzy\nchilled-out rock to a crowd of tens of\nthousands of fans. Finishing their set\nto the sound of \u201coh my god, oh my god,\noh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh\nyour god, oh his god, oh her god\u201d (the\nlyrics of \u201cShady lane\u201d) sung by every\nperson there.\nThis is not a festival for everyone,\nbut that is why it works so well. It\u2019s a\nfestival that draws in indie music enthusiasts from across the globe (you\ncouldn\u2019t turn your head for the sound\nof different accents). When every\nsingle person there seems to be in a\nperpetual state of disbelief about how\ngood the line up is it creates a collective feeling of belonging and satisfaction that you just will not find at the big\nfestivals where the bands are this year\u2019s\nchart-toppers and they take second\nplace to the idea of \u201ca festival\u201d. That is\nfine for most people, but for music lov-ers, this is so much better.\n\n"

Here is a list of other possible reasons for you not having\na girlfriend:\n1 - You\u2019re insanely boring and tedious\nand drain life from others around you\n2 - You\u2019re fat and ugly and you don\u2019t\nhave a personality to compensate. (Or\nyou\u2019re too fat and ugly for personality\nto even come into the equation)\n3 - You think that incessant talking\nmakes you interesting\n4 - You spend more time on World of\nWarcraft than RL (If you don\u2019t know\nwhat RL stands for then this most likely doesn\u2019t apply to you)\n5 - You smell. Take a shower. No se-riously, it\u2019s not even funny. You introduced me to my gag reflex.\n6 - You wear black tank tops with\nSLAYER scrawled in a red bloody font\nacross the front. Baggy black jeans\nwith metal dangly bits, long greasy\nhair - OK I GET IT! YOU LIKE METAL MUSIC! CONGRATULATIONS!\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have to\ndress like a fucking dick\n7 - You relate everything to some\nFamily Guy episode you\u2019ve seen and\nthen quote it\n8 - You can\u2019t dance. You do that thing\nwhere you sort of just jog on the spot\nand then enthusiastically mouth along\nto the lyrics to ensure that everyone\nin the club can see that you know the\nwords.\n9 - You mix up \u2018your\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re\u2019. I\u2019m\nnot a girl, but if I were and some guy\nwhispered in my ear, \u2018Your a filthy slut\u2019,\nI\u2019d spit in his face and say, \u2018I maybe a\nfilthy slut, but I would NEVER misuse\nthe possessive pronoun.\u2019\nTHE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nThe guy\u2019s a liability. Dyu remember the tiem\nwen he was drivin us to Bristol and he ran over\nthat wheelchair person?\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\nOsie\u2019s been banned from Twatter for an insensitive joke\n10 - You talk about \u2018being drunk\u2019 as\nif it\u2019s in the same league as base jump-ing. \u2018Man you should have checked me\nout last night - I was drunk.\u2019 \u2018NOWAY!\nYou were drunk? You drank alcohol?\nAre you some sort of rock star? You\ncan\u2019t just go around drinking alcohol,\nthat shit is dangerous! I honestly can\u2019t\nbelieve you were drunk. I\u2019m going to\ntext all my friends. Can I have a photo\nwith you? It\u2019s going to be my facebook\nprofile picture\u2019\n11 - You\u2019re too short. Nothing you\ncan do about that. No-one is ever going to love you\n12 - You listen to bands that no-one\nhas ever heard of, just for the sake of\nlistening to bands that no-one has\never heard of. You\u2019re the same person\nthat uses ridiculously ecoteric musical\ncategories like \u2018Neopagan symphonic\nminimal techno\u2019. You\u2019ve never heard\nof Neopagan symphonic minimal\ntechno? I guess you\u2019re into your mainstream techno. I hate mainstream music because it\u2019s mainstream\n13 - You read the financial times\nand talk about the economy. (Refer to\nnumber 1)\n14 - You try to make a philosophical\ndilemma out of every fucking state-ment, \u201cYou want a cup of tea?\u201d\n\u201cDo I want a cup of tea? Or does the\ncup of tea simply need me to want it?\u201d\n....\u201cWhat? That doesn\u2019t even make any\nsense.\u201d\n\u201cHow would one go about making sense?

I don\u2019t know if it\nwould be worse to be killed by a cup\nof tea, or just a teabag. A teabag with\npointy teeth and little hands. HAHAHAHAHAHA, a teabag with little\nhands. I want a pet teabag with little\nhands; I\u2019d call him Rodney and I\u2019d feed\nhim museli. But he doesn\u2019t even like\nmuseli. He like\u2019s Alpen, but that\u2019s technically not museli.

I don\u2019t know if Muhammad had a beard, but I\u2019m too scared\nto ask. We\u2019ll play it safe and assume he\nhad a moustache.

You\u2019re not ill, you\u2019re\njust a bit sad and you told the doctor\nyou\u2019re a bit sad and the doctor said,\n\u2018yep you\u2019re a bit sad, now go forth and\nruin everyone\u2019s party\u2019. I\u2019m using party\nas a metaphor for when you\u2019re not\naround, because it feels like a party.\nEveryone\u2019s depressed - I\u2019m depressed,\nbut like cool-depressed. I smoke in the\nrain and weep gently to Eric Clapton.\nThe real art is the gentle weeping. One\nsmall tear down the left cheek - perfec-tion. One more tear and you\u2019ve ruined\neverything, well done. You can\u2019t even\nbe depressed properly - you\u2019re useless\n21 - You talk about your course\n22 - You\u2019re on the football team. But\nwait a second? You guys sleep with\ngirls all the time right? Well I say girls,\nbut they\u2019re more like STI vending ma-chines. The ones that will give you what\nyou want, so long as you give them a\ngood punching. I guess, as an exception to rule 16, they really are objects.\nSaying \u201cPussy is Pussy\u201d is all very well,\nbut then you have to ask if some gaping\nchasm of sagging weathered skin that\nresembles a disembowled stomach really is a pussy anymore.\nBut the reason you\u2019re not getting a girl\nis not because you\u2019re an awkward, intolerable self-absorbed c**t, it\u2019s clearly\nbecause of the gender ratio. Now shut\nup, stop going on about it and fuck off\nback to your room and masturbate to\nNeopagan interpretive frog porn.\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\nlol yeah, we wer all liek \u2018Shiiiiiiiit\u2019 and Osie already had 9 points on his licence so he drove\noff.

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 11 JUNE 2010\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk TECHNOLOGY\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nI\nf you\u2019re an Apple lover\nwe\u2019ve had quite a week.\nAs you can see above\nApple announced its\niPhone 4 at WWDC 2010, but\nthat\u2019s not all Apple was showing off. iPhone OS has been\nrenamed iOS, which isn\u2019t exactly a surprise considering\nit now powers three different\niDevices. Apple released the\nGolden Master (read: feature\ncomplete) iOS4 to developers,\nwhich was promptly spread\nacross the greater internet. So\nif you\u2019re an iPhone 3G/3GS\nwielder and want it now, and\nhave a Mac for iTunes 9.2, you\ncan install iOS4 right now and\nnot have to wait till June 21st.\nIndeed there was even better\nnews for iPhone 3Gers as some\nindustrious fellows found that\nif you jailbreak an iPhone 3G\nwith iOS4 on it, you can enable\nboth multitasking and home\nscreen wallpaper with a quick\nedit to a small settings file. Apple doesn\u2019t want you to have\nthese features on your 3G, but\nafter some experience with it\nI can tell you it runs just fine;\nApple be damned.\nSafari 5 was also released\nthis week at WWDC featuring a 30% increase\nin speed and Safari\nReader, a readability\nbased tool that strips\nout everything but\nthe goods of an arti-cle, so you can read it\nwithout distractions.\nGoogle\u2019s search index is now\nfully caffeinated as it has rolled\nout its new, faster search al-gorithm, Caffeine, to the rest\nof its data centres. You might\nnot notice much of a speed\nincrease, but believe me it is\nfaster, it was just pretty fast to\nbegin with.\nTwitter this week gave a pre-announcement that it\u2019s going\nto start wrapping all links in its\nown link shortening service\n\u2018t.co\u2019 automatically. Bad\nnews for link shortening services like \u2018bit.\nly\u2019, as Twitter is going to do it transparently and on the fly,\nmeaning you won\u2019t\nhave to shorten your own\nURLs before tweeting them.\nIt may even be the case that\nyou don\u2019t see the shortened\nURL in the tweet either, just\nthe expanded one.\nTwitter also let out some\ninteresting subscriber stats\nshowing that they have over\n190 million users and that\nthey tweet 65 million times\na day, which is up 30% since\nApril. According to Costolo,\nTwitter\u2019s COO, most users\ndon\u2019t tweet at all, but just read\nothers\u2019 tweets. It\u2019s also not\nclear how many of those 65m\ntweets a day are automated\nspam tweets.\nMicrosoft announced that\nits Windows 7 Service Pack 1\nwill hit public\nbeta in July.\nMainly containing bug\nfixes and\npatches,\nSP1 does\ninclude new\nRemote\nDesktop\nsupport for\nWindows Server 2008\nSP1 features. Handy if you\nneed some remote support,\nbut frankly boring for anyone\nelse.\nGoogle\u2019s Nexus One got\na shot in the arm thanks to\nsome clever Android hacking,\nwhich enabled 720p video recording from its 5MP camera.\nIt\u2019s not currently available for\nFroyo, but it\u2019ll only be a matter of time. That\u2019s the beauty\nof an open source OS, anyone\ncan get stuck in and modify\nthe ROM without too much\ntrouble.\nAnd finally, as it\u2019s nearly\nWorld Cup time, how about\na David Beckham story? Yahoo have managed to sign\nBecks to be the public face of\ntheir World Cup and Premier\nLeague coverage. Dave will get\nhis own channel where he\u2019ll\nshare his own experiences of\nthe World Cup. Then during\nthe forthcoming Premiership\nseason, fans will be able to\ncontact Goldenballs through\nY!Messenger and Y!Mail. Nice.\niPhone 4 - Here\u2019s what you need to know\nSamuel Gibbs shows you what\u2019s what with Apple\u2019s latest and greatest, a fourth generation smartphone\nA4 processor\nApple\u2019s own A4 CPU from the iPad\nhas been squeezed into the iPhone;\npowerful yet power sipping.\n9.3mm thin\nThe iPhone 4 is 24% thinner than the\niPhone 3GS making it the thinnest\nsmartphone available.\nFaceTime\niPhone 4 comes with video chat\ncalled FaceTime. It works over WiFi\nand needs no configuration, working\nwith both front and back cameras.\n802.11n + BT\nFinally WiFi-N for high speed web\nbrowsing, email, video and FaceTime,\njoining the already present BlueTooth\n2.1 + EDR for music and headset\nsupport.\nTwo cameras\nA front-facing VGA camera joins a\n5MP backside illuminated shooter on\nthe back capable of HD 720p 30FPS\nvideo with enhanced low-light\nsensitivity and an LED flash.\nGlass front & back\nThe scratch resistant hardened glass\ncovering the front now covers the\nback too, bolting into a stainless steel\nframe that forms part of the antenna\nfor the phone\u2019s various radios.\n3.5\u201d Retina Display\n960x640 IPS display with massive\n326 ppi (denser than the human eye\ncan see) and a 800:1 contrast ratio.\nKey Features\n3-axis gyro\niPhone 4 packs a 3-axis gyro adding\nto the existing digital compass,\naccelerometer and GPS for 6-axis\nmotion sensing. Great for games.\nDual mics\nOneforvoicecallsonthebottomand\nanother for noise cancellation on top.\nBigger battery\nApple has managed to squeeze in\na 16% bigger battery in the iPhone\n4. Combined with the A4 provides\n7hrs talk, 10 hours video, 40 hours of\nmusic and 300 hours of standby time.\nH\nere it is folks, I give you the\niPhone 4! Yes, after much\nrumour and speculation,\nleaked prototypes and\ncourt cases, Apple\u2019s iPhone 4 has officially been unveiled. Steve Jobs took to\nthe stage of the WWDC 2010 opening\nkeynote to show off his latest creation.\nOK, so there\u2019s nothing truly revolutionary here, but it\u2019s a very comprehensive package that is going to sell\nlike hot cakes. The highlights include a\nscreen that\u2019s got a higher pixel density\nthan the human eye can differentiate\nat over 320 pixels per inch. Apple calls\nit the Retina Display and what it essentially means is that text and images\nlook incredibly crisp.\nApple\u2019s packed its little burner of\na processor, the A4, into the iPhone\n4, which we\u2019ve seen previously in the\niPad. The rear camera has been improved with backside illumination and\nbumped up to 5MPs, which should\nmake shooting in low-light conditions\nbetter. It\u2019ll also provide you with 720p\nHD video recording at 30fps, which\nyou can now edit right on the device\nwith a portable version of iMovie.\niPhone 4 also come with a VGA\ncamera on the front ready for Apple\u2019s\nFaceTime, a zero configuration iPhone\n4 to iPhone 4 Wifi-only (for now)\nvideo calling service that looks great.\nWhether you\u2019ll use it, I don\u2019t know.\nThe battery is now 14% bigger, whilst\nthe phone has thinned by 24% to an\nanorexic 9.3mm thick. Both front and\nback are made of hardened glass held\ntogether by a stainless steel band. Solid.\nYours from June 24th with pre-orders\nstarting on the 15th on most networks.\ne eased\nC fea-ease\nri\nto sta t w\nown link\n\u2018t.co\nn\ni\nm\ne\nw\nWindows\n\n"

    "content": "An unusually intelligent rock record,\nthis sounds a little like the politicised\npunk-rock that Green Day have been\nchurning out for the last five years, but\nwith less posturing and, impressively, a\nmore introspective attitude. Although\nlargely unknown in the UK, the Florida\nrockers have been turning out punk\nrecords for over a decade now, and the\nexperience seems to have mellowed\nand deepened their sound in a way that\nlifts them beyond the mass-production\npunk-pop dominating the charts.\n- Duncan Casey\nAGAINST ME\nI WAS A TEENAGE\nANARCHIST\nWEA\nINTERNATIONAL\nSINGLE\n14 felix FRIDAY 11 JUNE 2010\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nMUSIC\nReviews\nAh, the obligatory pretentious art-rock\noffering. Falsetto? Check. Quirky\ntime signatures? Check. It\u2019s a regular\ncollection of Bloc Party-u-like clich\u00e9s.\nThe choppy timing has the unfortunate\neffect of making the record sound like\nyou\u2019re listening to it on Atlantic 252 on\nlong wave - fading in and out so rapidly that it\u2019s almost impossible to listen\nto without checking to see if the CD\u2019s\nskipping. Avoid.\n- Duncan Casey\nEVERYTHING\nEVERYTHINGI\nSCHOOLIN\u2019\nGEFFEN\nSINGLE\nBack when Propane Nightmares came\nout, I really thought Pendulum were\non to something. Since then, though,\nthey\u2019ve gone the way of Linkin Park:\nalthough the ingredients are there, the\nend product is simply less than the sum\nof its parts. Watercolour is no exception - while the energy is there and the\nbassline does its job, it sounds anodine,\nclinical and joyless: like it was written\nto appeal to radio audiences rather than\nbecause it was fun.

In those idle moments between\nproductive bursts of revision, students\ndaydreaming of a more glamourous\nlife; I could have played for England, I\ncould quit and go traveling or perhaps\nI could be a rockstar. For Valeria Del\nPrete these daydreams grew and grew\nuntil one day, after a Masters in Physics, a PhD and a year of post-doc study,\nshe finally decided it was time to turn\ndreams to reality.\nWe\u2019re sitting outside the Builder\u2019s\nArms near Gloucester Road and she\u2019s\njoking about how she still managed to\nget lost even though she\u2019s spent a lot\nof time around Imperial through her\nwork assisting and tutoring a disabled\nImperial Physics student. She\u2019s just\nrecently finished a degree in Vocal\nProduction at Thames Valley University and like many Imperial students, is\nfeeling refreshed after weeks of exams.\nBut how does an academic from Italy\nend up producing music in her bedroom in Acton that Radio 6\u2019s Tom Robinson called \u201cmore original than 95% of\nthe mundane nonsense churned out by\n\u201cprofessional\u201d studios and labels these\ndays\u201d and \u201cpossibly the most assured\ndebut recording I\u2019ve heard by a UK\nartist since \u201cThe Wizard\u201d by Bat For\nLashes.\u201d?\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved music. I started\nplaying piano when I was 3 on this one\noctave piano and at the beginning I\nwas just banging the same chord but I\njust naturally progressed with it. And\nwhen I was a teenager I was in a few\nbands. Rock bands mainly, playing\nstuff like Van Halen\u201d\nShe laughs at her younger self, faintly\nembarrassed at the memory.\n\u201cI have a very soft voice now, so you\ncan imagine me at 15 trying to sing\nVan Halen. I still have some recordings\nand they\u2019re just hilarious.\u201d\nThe inevitable question on the tip of\nmy tongue is what persuaded her to go\ndown the safe route. Was it a lack of\ncourage or parental pressure?\n\u201cIt was a mixture of the two. My parents liked that I played music but they\ndidn\u2019t like it as a career. They saw being a singer as kind of a whorish job.\nThey have this idea of it being sexed\nup and all that. And they would say\nthat my voice wasn\u2019t good enough. My\ndad\u2019s idea of a good voice is Whitney\nHouston and anything below that or\ndifferent from that isn\u2019t good. And at\nthe same time I wasn\u2019t very confident,\nI was really uncomfortable with myself\nwhen I was a teenager. If I had started\nmaking music then, it probably would\nhave been a disaster. I was too dramatic and emotional about everything.\u201d\nBut her time studying Physics wasn\u2019t\nnecessarily an unhappy period in her\nlife. As she tells it, she was too busy\nstudying and learning for things like\nunhappiness. \u201cIt was like being under\nthe influence of some drug, I put aside\nany ambition that I had. It was like being a completely different person.\u201d\nIt took a long time for Valeria the\nmusicians to fight back against Valeria the scientist. She\u2019d had an interest\nin neuroscience as a teenager and basically sleep-walked into a PhD at the\nInternational School for Advanced\nStudies in Trieste.\n\u201cDuring my PhD I started to get\nover my lack of confidence and something started to re-emerge. I started\nto become dissatisfied and I thought,\n\u201cDo I really want to become a 50-year\nold professor?\u201d But it wasn\u2019t sudden,\nwhen you\u2019ve been studying for so long\nit\u2019s hard to just renounce it all. It took\nanother two years to make that deci-sion. I got depressed and eventually I\njust reached a threshold.\u201d\nWas there a moment I ask her? A\nsudden decisive revelation?\nGiven that she is dubstep\u2019s most anticipated female artist, with singles such\nas \u2018Please\u2019 behind her and is signed\nto Kode 9\u2019s label Hyperdub, I was eager to hear Ikonika\u2019s debut. However\neven with all the excitement, it was\nhard to listen to the end. The incessant\nvideo game samples, grated on me\nand left me longing for a heavier bass\nline. The lack of real instrumentals\nis obvious and the glitchiness of the\nsynths scratches at your ears. It isn\u2019t a\ncomplete write-off with the anthemic\n\u2018Ikonoklast\u2019 and Burial-esque \u2018Continue?\u2019 providing much needed relief.\n- Sophie Okell\nIKONIKA\nCONTACT LOVE\nWANT HAVE\u2019\nHYPERDUB\nALBUM\n\u201cDuring my PhD\nI started to become\ndissatisfied and\nI thought, \u2018Do\nI really want to\nbecome a 50-year\nold professor?\u2019 But\nit was still hard to\nrenounce it all\u201d\nFlying lotus has dubbed Cosmogramma his \u201cspace opera\u201d, and as his third\nalbum in four years, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s taken\na different theme. It\u2019s an album that\nworks as a whole for the devoted fan\nand has singles that have wider appeal\nlike \u201c...And the World Laughs with\nYou\u201d, a collaboration with Thom Yorke\nthat mixes Flying Lotus\u2019 trademark\ndeep basslines and electronics with\nYorke\u2019s haunting vocals and \u201cDo the\nAstral Plane\u201d which, with its clear funk\ninfluence, will put a smile on your face\nand get you at least doing your chair\ndance.\n- Sophie Okell\nFLYING LOTUS\nCOSMOGRAMMA\nWARP RECORDS\nALBUM\n\u201cI remember what finally made me\ndecide. I went back to Italy for a few\nweeks and I got in touch with some\nmusicians that I knew there and we did\na couple of sessions together and I suddenly realized \u201cThis is great! I want to\ndo this all my life.\u201d\nThat was 6 years ago but Valeria isn\u2019t\nfazed by her relative lack of success,\nwhen the compared to flash-in-the-pan stars of mainstream pop. \u201cI liked\nthe idea of success more when I was\nyounger. But now success scares me.\nObviously having enough money so\nthat you don\u2019t have to worry is great\nbut success is also a cage. You can\u2019t go\nout with friends, you don\u2019t have your\nown time, so right now I\u2019m quite happy\nbecause I\u2019m in control of what I\u2019m do-www.last.fm/music/double+thumb\nwww.myspace.com/crazyforicecream\ning. My main goal isn\u2019t success, it\u2019s to\nproduce quality music that I\u2019m happy\nwith and that people appreciate genu-inely, not just because I\u2019m in a magazine but because of the music.\u201d\nIt\u2019s great to hear somebody talk about\ntheir commitment to \u201cthe music\u201d\nwithout the usual garbled pretentious\ntwaddle that usually accompanies, but\nI can\u2019t help but take her criticism of\nsuccess with a pinch of salt. When I ask\nher the age old question, \u201cWho would\nyou love to perform with?\u201d she laughs\nand answers cheekily \u201cAn audience of\n35,000 people.\u201d\n\n"

Incoming Deputy President\n(Welfare) Vicki Masding has expressed\nher discontent at the situation John\nJames has left her in.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not ideal. I think it\u2019s\ngoing to be very daunting without his\nguidance,\u201d she said.\nJames stated that he felt \u201cguilty\u201d about\nleaving a largely inexperienced Masding\nto a \u201ccomprehensive handbook\u201d and her\nown devices as soon as she starts her\nrole.\n\u201cI do feel guilty, and I have the Union\u2019s\nThe world beyond College walls\nBy Tom Greany\nIran Spain\nF\nrench President Nicholas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a letter this week to European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\narguing that the commission should ban naked short\nselling of European Union member country government debt.\nLast month, Germany also banned the practice on debt, credit\ndefault swaps, and equity of governments and certain financial\ncompanies. That move was controversial at the time, creating\ntumult in markets and exposing differences in opinion on the\nmatter between various E.U. governments. Naked short selling\nis the process of selling a security without actually owning it. It\nalters the market price of the security while the transaction remains open until the seller completes the sale by delivering the\npromised security. Critics of the practice claim that it removes\ntransparency of markets and allows for gross manipulation.\nMerkel and Sarkozy claimed that restricting naked shorts will\nremove market turbulence; skeptics claim that many investors\nseeking stability have already left the markets in question and\nthat any turbulence is derived instead from political turmoil.\nEurope\nO\nrganisers of Madrid\u2019s Gay Pride parade have\nbanned Israelis from entering the parade due to\nthe flotilla debacle. The Spanish Federation of\nLesbians, Gays and Transexuals argued that because Tel Aviv local authorities have not condemned the Israeli\nmilitary\u2019s handling of the flotilla incident, Tel Aviv revellers\nwill not be allowed to join in the festivities and that it would\nbe \u201cbarbaric\u201d to allow them to do so given the situation. Tel\nAviv residents wishing to join the celebration were dismayed\nand upset by the announcement, saying that it is not the responsibility of local authorities to make statements regarding\nforeign policy and went on to criticise the Spanish for siding\nwith pro-Palestinian causes. Eytan Schwartz, a Tel Aviv spokes-person, stated, \u201cIt is shameful that they should join with pro-Palestinian and fundamentalist groups which are not exactly\ntolerant with homosexuality.\u201d Schwartz stated to the Guardian\nthat he hoped to to organise a trip for the Spanish Gay Pride\norganisers to Gaza, where he claims that Hamas is not tolerant\ntowards gays and transexuals.\nT\nhe United Nations Security Council placed new\nsanctions on Iran this week as a result of its nuclear\nprogram. Twelve of the fifteen members of the council voted for the measures, which were not significantly greater in severity than previous sanctions, while Brazil\nand Turkey voted against them and Lebanon abstained from\nvoting. More significant perhaps than these measures are the\nsubsequent sanctions promised by both the United States and\nthe European Union, which were contingent upon the U.N.\u2019s\napproval this week. Also notable was the fact that the Obama\nadministration was by and large the largest proponent of these\nsanctions. For the majority of his tenure thus far, U.S. president\nBarack Obama has pursued a strategy of enticing Iran to cease\nits nuclear programme through incentives instead of sanctions\nor hostility. The sanctions place a ban on selling large weapons\nto Iran such as ships, aircraft, tanks, missiles, et cetera in addition to language about banking and the energy industry. Backers of the sanctions do not expect them to place much pressure\non Iran but instead to perhaps encourage the country to return\nto negotiations.\nbest interests at heart,\u201d he assured felix.\nJames plans to use July to travel\naround Egypt, and stated that it was an\nopportunity he couldn\u2019t miss out on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime trip with my\nbest friend. He\u2019s a Medic and this is the\nonly time we can both do it.\u201d\nHe also argues that July\u2019s handover\nperiod isn\u2019t the most important part\nof the Sabbatical role saying that it is\na \u201clow period of requirement\u201d which\nmostly involves formally meeting different members of College.\n\u201cOf course it would be better if I was\nthere, but it isn\u2019t the be it and end all of\nthe role,\u201d he said.\nHe has also confirmed he will make\nup to three weeks available in August\nonce he returns to answer any questions from his successor. Concerns were\ninitially voiced in the last Council meeting of term that Masding\u2019s Biochemistry exams finish only three days before\nJames is due to leave for Egypt.\nThe Union also plan to enlist the help\nof Hannah Theodorou, Deputy President (Education & Welfare) 2008-2009,\nduring James\u2019 absence.\nMasding herself put note to the fact\nshe has little prior experience for such\nan important role.\n\u201cI\u2019m inexperienced anyway, so I probably need more help, but I\u2019m getting less\nthan the standard,\u201d she said. \u201cA handbook just isn\u2019t as engaging as having\nsomeone there for me.\u201d\nAlthough speculation has been bandied around the Union since he handed\nin his notice, some of those working\nclosest with him failed to be informed\nimmediately.\nJonathan Silver, Deputy President\n(Education) was surprised to hear about\nJohn James at the start of his sabbatical year during Freshers\u2019 Week\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\nNext year\u2019s\nDeputy President\n(Welfare)\nVicki Masding\nsaid John\nJames seemed\n\u201csheepish\u201c when\nhe announced\nhis resignation\nto her\nhis office-mate\u2019s resignation as late as\nlast week.\nHe had been informed after a felix reporter assumed the situation was common knowledge amongst the current\nSabbatical team.\nAshley Brown, Union President, was\nresigned to what he described as an\n\u201cunavoidable situation\u201d\n, suggesting that\nJames had been adamant he would be\ngoing on holiday in July whether the\nUnion liked it or not.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made sure that no Sabbs are allowed to take holiday during the hando-ver. It\u2019s saving us money by him resign-ing. We don\u2019t have to pay his wages,\u201d\nstated Brown.\nWhen probed whether he thought\nJames\u2019 actions were irresponsible,\nBrown refused to comment, but echoed\nMasding\u2019s concerns by calling the situation \u201cnot ideal.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019lldoourbesttodealwiththehandover without him,\u201d Brown concluded.\nCurrent Union\nPresident Ashley\nBrown has\nassured felix that\nany problems\ncaused by James\u2019\nabsence during\nhandover will be\nminimised the\nbest they can\n\n"

Eventually, an under-manned Barts team trickled in, requesting that we send one team member to\nhelp make up their numbers in the field\nbefore commencing play. Wish granted,\nImperial won the toss and elected to bat\nfirst on a pitch that wicket-keeper Adam\nHugill described as a \u2018road\u2019\n. Needless to\nsay, a high total from Imperial\u2019s much\nvaunted batting line-up was expected.\nUnfortunately, that is precisely what\ndid not happen. Quick wickets fell at\nthe top of the order with opener Anirudh Sompali gone after three balls,\nknicking a wide delivery through to the\nkeeper. His partner Matt Tarr followed\nhim soon afterwards, playing at one too\nearly and lobbing a catch to square-leg.\nThe pitch, it was found, was quite soft\nunderneath due to the rain the previous\nday and so the ball slowed down off the\npitch and did not bounce. Captain Ankit \u2018the anchor\u2019 Patel went in to steady\nthe ship and he played some delightful cut-shots before miscuing a pull\nstraight to mid-on.\nAt 31-3 things were looking grim,\nbut Iain Stobbs (22) and Viran Parmar\n(21) formed a neat little partnership,\nbringing Imperial beyond embarrass-ment, before Parmar unluckily got a\nthin edge on a short and wide delivery\nthat was asking to be hit. After that,\nbatsmen came and went and it was only\nthanks to a counter-punching innings\nA mixed innings\nCricket Men\u2019s 1st XI continue their medic bashing, whilst the Women\u2019s 1st XI fall at the hands of the Essex\nImperial College Men\u2019s 1st XI\n\u2013 122 all out\nSt Barts Medical School XI\n\u2013 83 all out\nImperial won by 39 runs\nCeleste van den Bosch Cricket\nImperial College Women\u2019s 1st XI\n\u2013 103 all out\nEssex 1st XI\n\u2013 129 all out\nImperial lost by 26 runs\nfrom Muhammed Ali (27*) that Imperial limped to its total of 122 all out after\n30.3 overs.\nHowever, with the sun still shining,\na good tea and a surprise visit from\nformer president Shiraz Sabah, Imperial took to the field with a lot of energy\nand optimism. The bowlers proceeded\nto get to work. Captain Patel (8-2-15-2) set the tone by ripping the opening\nbatsmen\u2019s off-stump out of the ground\nand together with Viran Parmar (8-4-13-1), they formed a lethal partnership;\nbowling maiden after maiden and taking the odd wicket to reduce Barts to\n31-3 after 16 overs.\nMuhammed Ali (7.1- 2-20-3) and\nAndy Payne (7-0-33-3) then looked to\nfinish up what the opening bowlers had\nstarted. Ali bowled with great effort and\naccuracy to tie up one end, while Andy,\nslightly less economical, took wickets by\nutilizing his height to great effect and\nbemusing the opposition batsmen with\nhis slower bouncer.\nGradually, Imperial, with their tight\nfielding and superb catching, tightened\nthe noose around Barts with Ali fittingly delivering the knockout punch by\nwrapping up the match with two wickets in his last two balls to leave Barts all\nout on 83.\nA\nfter being chauffeur\ndriven to Essex by the\nco-captains, Imperial\nWomen\u2019s 1st XI cricket\nteam was ready to play\ntheir second match on the warmest\nday of the year. Captains Priya Shah\nand Kushani Ediriwickrema lost the\ntoss to the Essex captain who decided\nto bat first. With some apprehension the eight women who were able\nto make it, in this busy exam period,\ntook to the field to take on the top\nteam in the league. Celeste van den\nBosch and Kushani Ediriwickrema\nopened the bowling and it soon became evident that the Essex team had\nreversed their batting order. Therefore\nPriya Patel and Chandni Nakum were\ngiven the still shiny cricket ball and\neach bowled a full 7-over spell as Imperial\u2019s tactics were adjusted to keep\nthe \u201clower-order\u201d opening batswomen\nin. There were short celebrations over\nPriya Patel\u2019s first wicket, a run-out and\nan amazing catch from wicket keeper,\nMithila Patkunan. Si\u00e2n Fogden and\nPriya Shah also bowled several overs\nwith one run-out occuring in Shah\u2019s\nlast over. The last three overs were\nbowled by the opening pair to end Essex\u2019s batting innings with a total of 129.\nAfter tea, Mithila Patkunan and Tara\nLaForce set out to open the bowling with confidence and with the aim\nto go slow but steady. Unfortunately\nboth the openers were soon out with\nonly 4 runs off the bat between them.\nDespite the loss of these early wickets,\nPriya Shah and Si\u00e2n Fogden were able\nto setup a good partnership until Priya\nShah was bowled by the Essex captain.\nA second partnership between Si\u00e2n\nFogden and Celeste van den Bosch re-sulted. However when attempting to\nincrease the run rate, Si\u00e2n Fogden was\nunfortunately bowled as well. The final\nthree wickets of Kushani Ediriwickrema, Priya Patel and Chandni Nakum\nfell quickly leaving Imperial with only\n103 runs. Though a loss, the Imperial\nwomen\u2019s team are already focusing on\nnext year\u2019s cricket season.\n\n"

You\ncould hardly imagine Crocodile Dundee in a suit or Rolf Harris without\nthat happy, but slightly idiotic, look\non his face. But The Bamboos, armed\nwith a Blaxpoitation-era funk vibe\nand Kylie Auldist\u2019s rich, soulful vo-cals, prove that there\u2019s some style to\nbe found Down Under.\nTheir latest album \u20184\u2019 (coinciden-tally their fourth in as many years) is\na varied mix of powerful horns and\nstretched syllables on \u201cOn The Sly\u201d\nand conspiratorial finger-clicking alleyway smoking on \u201cYou Ain\u2019t No\nGood\u201d. I spent much of my time revising for exams with the album on in\nthe background and it functioned like\nan attentive girlfriend; quietly and\nconfidently helpful without distracting or annoying. It\u2019s not an explosion\nof watermelons like an Animal Collective album nor a continuous reprise of the same sound like Bombay\nBicycle Club\u2019s debut; instead it confidently explores a number of different\nsounds, the most audacious of which\nis a 5-minute sitar solo which sounds\nbetter on CD than it does in print.\nDespite a couple of weak tracks\n- \u201cTurn It Up\u201d is one - the album is\na success and if my endorsement\ndoesn\u2019t convince (and let\u2019s be honest,\nwhy would it) take heed of funk legend Syl Johnson\u2019s words \u201cThe Bamboos are bad mother-****ers!\u201d\n- Kadhim Shubber\nThe\nBamboos\n4\nTru Thoughts\nQuantic\nDog With A\nRope\nTru Thoughts\nQuantic is probably one of the most\nimportant musicians of our time. Like\nthe early explorers of the New World,\nhe returns every few months with new\nfound musical treasures from Central\nand Southern America that delight\nand astound those who care to lend\ntheir ears. It\u2019s not only that he is immeasurably talented and not only that\nhe is impossibly prolific (although\nthose facts alone would identify him\namongst the most interesting artists\naround today) but it\u2019s his approach to\nmusic that truly sets him apart. He\u2019s a\ncollector who refuses to let the varied\nsounds of the Americas gather dust\nin hot, forgotten record stores and\nan explorer constantly seeking out\nnew ingredients for his musical reci-pes, working with musicians of every\nconceivable background and bringing\nattention to sounds as yet unheard by\nWestern ears.\nThat\u2019s the man, the album is as ex-pected: beautiful. I cannot claim to\nwrite with a Pitchfork-like confidence\nabout the intricacies of dub and reggae calypso fusion but no-one listening to \u201cDog With A Rope\u201d could fail\nto appreciate its quality and relaxed\ncomplexity.

The most\nstriking feature in the photograph, that\nsmile. The one captured and frozen within a millisecond, desynchronised from the\nnatural progression of time. What does\nthis represent? Joe, my one-time Malekulan guide, only seven years of age, posing\nwith a machete the length of his torso,\nsmiling \u2012 what do I see behind those rows\nof white teeth?\nA blessed innocence and pure glee?\nA coerced happiness and theatrical\ncooperation?\nI dropped the pen, turned up the kero-senelampandrubbedagainstmyeyes.My\nneighbours, a plump Italian man named\nLuigi and his wife, were arguing. Outside\nof the guesthouse, neatly placed by the\nshores of Rose Bay, waves clashed against\nboulders of petrified coral. Abandoned\nby my muses, I laid aside my notepad and\nstared at the ceiling.\nAnd it struck me: why was I there in the\nfirst place?\nWhile flights depart for Tanna and Espirito Santo daily from the ni-Van capitol\nPort Vila, and planes bound for Pentecost\npacked during the naghol season, between\nApril and June, the sparsely-scheduled\ntransport exchange between Malekula\nand the mainland, much more utilised by\nlocals than foreigners, often leaves tourists\nwondering whether or not the endeavour\nwould be worth their while.\nWhich, thankfully, leaves Malekula less\nfrequented than its counterparts \u2012 though\nlosing out in the tourism arms race is by\nno means an indication of tedium. Quite\nthe contrary, its succulent history of cannibalism riddles the island with relics\nand ex-sites of murder, and empowers its\nlocals with tales of masochism and, well,\ngluttony. What had terrorised sailors\nand diverted many navigators has now\nclaimed the title of being Malekula\u2019s main\nattraction.\nThe day after my arrival, I got to flex\nmy muscles on a jungle trek deep into the\nmountains, dextrously led through the\ntreacherous terrain by my guide George,\nat which I was promised a history lesson.\nNot until the teachers show up, though.\nFrom behind an inconspicuous pile of\nrubble, George pulled out the conch and\neffortlessly sent resonances across the\nhills. Some ten minutes passed with little\nwords passed between us.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, cannibalism was abolished yesterday\u201d; so many Fijians I had\nencountered, prior to my visit to Vanuatu,\nwould joke. At that very moment, being\nstalked from behind the bushes by would-be predators and consumers was hardly\nunimaginable, and hardly satirical.\nHunting weapons, tribal costumes,\ncanap\u00e9s of human meat on wooden cannibal forks, none of those the chief\u2019s son\nand his companion greeted us with. They\nwere raggedly clad, torn t-shirts and dusty\npants, armed only with machetes and\nwarm handshakes.\nLaunching straight into the narrative,\nwith George translating, they identified\nthe outwardly purposeless debris as stone\novens, drinking bowls, cooking surfaces,\nmirrors \u2012 basins filled with water that reflected one\u2019s face, painted prior to the ceremonious slaughter.\nAn open ground which surrounded a\nbanyan marked the spot where, tied to\nthe tree and macabre fate pending, the\ndaunted victim overlooked a procession\nof kava-crazed feasters, who would fanatically dance for an indefinite length of time\nbefore the inevitable deed took place.\nWith ease, the chief\u2019s son wedged his\nhand through a crack, under a burial site,\nand retrieved a skull. It belonged, he ex-plained, to the son of an ancestral chieftain of his.\n\u201cWhat about the bones of those who\nwere eaten?\u201d I enquired though having already half-guessed the answer.\n\u201cScattered all over, since they were disgraced and did not deserve a proper burial,\u201d the ni-Van replied, via George. \u201cThe\nbones are also used by those important\nin the tribe as jewellery, as trophies, to remind their enemies of their might.\u201d\nHow glad I was to have crossed their\npaths not with hostility, nor in the wrong\nera.\nI could imagine how much disappointment the locals have seen, throughout\ntheir careers as couriers of the cannibal\nsite: lacking elaborate exhibits, clearly-annotated and excessively educational\ndisplay signs, \u201cauthentic\u201d attire donned\nby my hosts and emanating captivation I\ncan only describe as corny and cheesy, the\ncommonmoderntouristswhofrequented\nOccidental museums and historical sites,\nwho would expect similar services even\ndeep in the forest, were up for a moan.\nWhile I enjoyed the site\u2019s idyllic charms,\nthe vivid edifying annotation and the urge\nto knock my imagination into full gear,\nmany may beg to differ \u2012 if they hadn\u2019t first\nfinished complaining about the half-dayreturnwalkthatledthemto\u201cnothingness\u201d.\nThough this wasn\u2019t alone result of rapid\nprogression of the increasingly demanding tourism industry \u2012 it was also due to\nthe genuine lack of interest in the tourism\nindustry, or the exploiting of, as displayed\nby many Malekulans.\n*\nKastomdances\u2012kastomaBislamaword\nderived from \u2018custom\u2019 \u2012 represent the psy-cheofeveryni-Vantribeandareconstitut-ed by their geography, climate and social\nvalues. The ones I saw on Malekula were\n\u201cFundamentally, no matter how much they consume from\nthe outside world, no matter how much they understand the\nmechanics, the Malekulans are confused. \u201d\nthose of appreciation, of delight to a bountiful harvest, traditionally performed during the gathering of local produce.\nAs far as what I witnessed in the present\nday was concerned, delight and appreciation were but shortages of expressions\non the men\u2019s faces. As they marched out,\nunclothed except for their nambas \u2012 or\npenis sheaths made of leaves \u2012 they broke\nintowell-rehearsedroutinesthatappeared\nmore rewarding to the ignorant foreigner\nand his camera, and less fulfilling to the\ndancers\u2019 sense of self satisfaction and their\nneed to give praise.\nIt wasn\u2019t that these people were nat-ural-born un-enthusiasts. I managed to\nrecognise a few individuals within the\nentourage with whom, over lunch consisting of rice and corned beef/tuna, I had exchanged anecdotes with earlier.\nGeorge asked me what I thought of the\nkastom dances. I managed a shrug.\n\u201cIt used to be better, Gibson.\u201d He developedthehabitofaddressingmeas\u2018Gibson\u2019\n\u2012 don\u2019t ask why. \u201cNow, bad management.\u201d\nPerhaps. Though, personally, I found\n\u2018management\u2019 of indigenous customs that\nare commercialised, a very Western concept indeed, much more sentimental than\nhearing a bad management had ruined the\nperformance. The kastom dances, treated\nlike a means of income, seemed to be losing their traditional values.\nThis wasn\u2019t the only trace of Western\ninfluence on the island. Further down the\nroad from Walarano, the village adjacent\nto Rose Bay, rusty poles were erected to\nserve as goals; barely having scrubbed off\nthe makeup the boys flaunted their football skills. The village shop, ever an emporium of fascination to the local children,\nsoldtinnedmeatandotherbasicimported\ngoods. Reggae remixes of pop hits burped\nout from every jeep stereo. Even kava,\nwhile achieving customary reverence\nin Fiji, was here passed through a meat\ngrinder instead of the more orthodox, and\nrespectable, preparation methods.\nNot that Malekula had a desire to oust\nall of its traditional values.\nI encountered a hunting party, completed with machetes and belligerent dogs, as\nI descended from the cannibal site. They\nwere searching for pigs: despite the presence of paper money, pigs and their tusks\nremain to this day as Vanuatu\u2019s most important form of currency. A family travelled by foot, seizing a broad leaf to shield\nthemselves from the raindrops.\nFundamentally, no matter how much\nthey consume from the outside world, no\nmatter how much they understand the\nmechanics, the Malekulans are confused.\nWhatever Western mind set, ideals, attitudes that came with the merchandise,\nwhat islanders could grasp are mostly\nthose of materialism.\nBack in Walarano, men fired up the\nenormous village oven to roast coconuts.\nSchool fees season loomed, and a shipment of copra were expected to be delivered soon. Sure it would bring income,\nthey confessed, though as to why the foreigners would pay for coconut oil they did\nnot know.\nLikewise with tourism. The Malekulans\nare tremendous in their understanding of\nhospitality; however, especially when they\nare relatively new to the concept of leisure\nThe Curious Case\nTourist on Island\nOne year on, Dylan Lowe recalls his visit on\ninterprets the hidden metaphors that depict\nto tourism\n\n"

This can be from a novel, play, a remake of a\nprevious film or often a completely original idea.\nThe next step is to prepare a treatment of the\nstory, this is usually a short synopsis of the film\nincluding characters and themes.\nThe treatment is then presented to a screenwriter\nwho will spend the next couple of months preparing\na full script. Alternatively the producer may buy a\nscript which has already been written by an aspiring\nor established writer. With the script in place the\nproducer will \u2018pitch\u2019 his film to a movie studio or\nindependent financiers. If the pitch is successful, the film\nis \u2018greenlighted\u2019 and once all the necessary contracts are\nsigned, the film moves into pre-production.\nPre-production\nBefore the film can start shooting, a production office is\nestablished to manage all aspects of its production. A\nstoryboard is constructed from the script outlying how\nevery scene should look. A budget is assigned to the film\nand then the cast and crew are hired! The most important\nmembers of the crew are as listed below.\nDirector Director of Photography\nSound Engineer Wardrobe and makeup\nThe director is the \u2018author\u2019 of the\nfilm and it\u2019s his vision that guides its\noutcome. The director controls most\naspects of the film\u2019s production at this\npoint.\nAlso known as a cinematographer, the\nDP is probably the most important\ncrew member after the director and is\nresponsible for the camera and lighting\ncrews.\nAn important role often looked\nover. The continuity of the actors\nappearance is meticulously\nmaintained.ss\nProduction\nOnce all the cast and crew have been hired, the filming can commence. Usually\none scene is shot per day as it takes a lot preparation and can sometimes\ninvolve many takes. The crew set up their equipment whilst the actors are made\nup and dressed in the wardrobe department. When everyone is ready, the\ndirector will start filming. In Hollywood there is a specific procedure to filming\ntakes as follows:\n\u2022 The Assistant Director (AD) calls \u201cpicture is up!\u201d to inform everyone a take\nis about to be shot.\n\u2022 Once the cast and crew are ready the AD calls \u201croll sound!\u201d. When the\nsound engineer is happy he calls \u201csound speed\u201d.\n\u2022 The AD calls \u201croll camera\u201d and the cameraman again replies \u201cspeed\u201d when\nthe camera is running.\n\u2022 The \u2018clapper\u2019 calls \u201cmarker!\u201d and snaps his snapperboard shot. The AD may\ncall \u201caction background\u201d if extras in the scene are required.\n\u2022 The director then calls \u201caction!\u201d to start the take and \u201ccut!\u201d when it\u2019s\nfinished.\n\u2022 This repeated for any additional angles required for the scene\n\u2022 When the director is happy with the scene he calls \u201cthat\u2019s a wrap!\u201d The crew\nwill then \u201cstrike\u201d and take down the set\nAfter the scene is shot the director and crew watch the \u201cdailies\u201d in the evening.\nOnce the whole film is entirely finished it is known as \u201cin the can\u201d and usually a\nwrap party is organised.\nPost-production\nAfter the film is in the can it is handed over to the editor. The editor first\nprepares a \u201crough cut\u201d of the film with the director. The rough cut is then\ndeveloped into a \u201cfine cut\u201dwhere the scenes and shots are improved to run\nsmoothly into each other. When the cut has been approved by the director and\nproducer it is \u201clocked\u201d and no more changes are made to it.\nA locked picture is then given to the supervising sound editor to create the\nsoundtrack for the film. A final sound mix is produced from the dialogue, sound\neffects and music which is then combined with the picture to create a rough\nproduct of the film. The film then undergoes various techniques to produce the\npolished cinema worthy edition.\nThe final film is shown to the producers and previewed by selected audiences. It\nmay be decided to re-edit or re-shoot some of the scenes after these screenings.\nEventually the finished film is duplicated and sent to the distributors. All\nof the big Hollywood studios distribute their own films but they also buy\nindependently backed films and distribute them as well. The distributors\nensure that the film has maximum marketing and that it is shown in as many\ncinemas as possible for all our enjoyment.\nThe sound engineer is in charge of\nthe audio in the film either on set or\nrecorded in a studio.\n\n"

Matt Colvin reports\nT\nhe Department of Mathematics has suffered a\nbacklash from students\nover plans to move its collection of books from the\nMaths Library to the Central Library\nas part of a college-wide scheme. The\nnews has particularly angered postgraduate students across various de-partments, who are dubbing the move\nas \u201cacademic vandalism\u201d.\nThese plans form part of the \u2018Single\nSequence Project\u2019, a mass reorganisation of libraries across campus, which,\naccording to its website, aims to \u2018make\nit easier to find what you are looking\nfor\u2019.\nSteven Johnston, a fourth year physics PhD student and self-proclaimed\nregular user of the library, disagrees\nwith the closure, scheduled for 16th\nJuly 2010, arguing that, \u201cwhen the library closes and the books are merged\ninto the Central Library my trips for\nbooks will take about 20 to 30 minutes\nand, based on my experience, I seriously doubt I\u2019ll find any central librarian\nwho knows anything about the books\nthey hold.\u201d\nMr. Johnston is also critical of the fact\nthat, \u201cthe first I heard about the closure\nwas from a fellow student. There\u2019s been\nno consultation with library users outside the Maths Department. I\u2019ve seen\nno posters about it; received no mass-emails. It feels as if (the Department is)\ntrying to close the library by stealth.\u201d\nAttempting to quash these concerns,\nthe Department has firmly defended\nits position on the issue, releasing the\nfollowing statement: \u201cSeveral departmental collections have recently been\nrelocated to the Central Library, with\nthe implication that the majority of the\nCollege\u2019s collection is now available\non open shelves 24 hours a day, with\ndedicated subject librarians available to\ngive advice on the resources that allow\nacademics to connect to the literature\nlarly among the postgraduate students\nwho naturally use these resources on a\nregular basis.\u201d\nHowever, he disagrees with Mr. Johnston\u2019s statement about \u201cstealth\u201d tac-tics, believing that, \u201cit was well known\nacross the student body that this was a\nbit of inevitability\u201d.\nThe Department attempted to\njudge the reaction of its own students\nthrough a vote conducted by e-mail,\nbut only those students currently on\nBSc or MSci courses. This saw a distinctly low turnout of only 33%, with\nonly 55% of these voters agreeing with\nthe plans to move the collections to the\nCentral Library. Mr. Bird claims that\nthese results show that the plans are\n\u201crelatively well-received\u201d.\nThose students contacted to take\npart in the survey do appear to tentatively back the scheme, with one Maths\nfresher remarking that, \u201cthe plans for\n(the Maths Library) do sound promis-ing. To me, it seems like a practical solution to maintaining its primary pur-pose, whilst ensuring that resources are\nstill available to be used and perhaps\neven more conveniently placed in their\nnew location.\u201d\nWith an adamant Maths Department\nsetting about to change the status quo\nwith the backing of relatively apathetic\nstudents, it appears increasingly likely\nthat unconsulted postgraduates across\ncampus may have to take a leaf out of\nMr. Johnston\u2019s book and protest the\nsituation.\nin their field.\n\u201cThe area that would be released by\nmoving the collections to the Central\nLibrary is allowing us to develop a flexible working space that will involve\nboth collaborative working areas, quiet\nspace for contemplative study and enable the Department to increase its\ncomputing provision.\u201d\nCharles Hyde-Andrews-Bird, Departmental Representative for Maths,\nfirmly agrees with the Department\u2019s\nstandpoint, claiming that, \u201cThe subject of the Mathematics Library is\none which has been discussed at great\nlength across the Department over the\nlast few months.\u201d He also acknowledges the anger felt by some postgradu-ates, stating that, \u201cthe relocation of\nthe books and journals to the Central\nLibrary or conversion to e-format was\nquite an unpopular decision, particu-The Department of Mathematics plan to relocate all books to the Central Library, whilst keeping the space open for study\nRoyal School of Mines to regain Union status\nD\nuring an otherwise dull\nmeeting of central Union Council, which discussed the hack bible\nthat is the Imperial College Union Constitution, one paper\ncaused members to stir from their daydreams about the bar downstairs: The\npaper was written by Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), Danny Hill,\nand supported by members of the\nRSM and CGCU exec. It successfully\nsought to change the RSM executive\nfrom a Clubs and Societies Board to a\nConstituent Union of Imperial College\nUnion, though the paper must yet be\nratified by the Union Executive Committee and will not come into effect\nuntil the 1st August.\nOther examples of Clubs and Societies Board (CSB) include the Athletic\nClubs Committee and the Recreational\nClubs Committee; their primary interest is to manage the activities of their\nconstituent clubs, particularly in terms\nof finances and resource management.\nThe classification of the Royal School\nof Mines (RSM) as a CSB occurred\naround eight years ago when College\nrestructured departments, effectively\ncombining the City and Guilds College\nand the RSM into the Faculty of Engineering. The Union followed College\nin restructuring, with the Royal School\nof Mines Union (RSMU) being swallowed by the City and Guilds College\nUnion (CGCU). It was assumed that\nover time the RSM would effectively\ndie out, with the name maintained for\nthe sake of historic clubs only.\nHowever, as stated by RSM president\nHenry Debens, the RSM have failed\nto disappear, instead \u201cthe RSM has\nproven itself time and time again to be\none of the, if not the, most active and\ndynamic student bodies within Imperial College Union and an entity which\nsimply does not fit the description of\na Clubs and Societies Committee on\nmany significant levels\u201d. This sentiment was echoed by many Council\nmembers. Primarily, it was noted that\nthe RSM hold numerous social, welfare and academic events each year\nand that the actions of the exec are\nlargely in the interests of all students\nregistered on the courses that formed\nthe RSM at its time of abolition.\nMr Debens has the proud position of\nbeing the RSM President under whom\nthe status of the RSM as a Constituent\nUnion has been reinstated, he told fe-lix: \u201cThe move allows for the students\nof the RSM to separate themselves\nfrom being directly under the umbrella\nof C&GC, their supposed rivals, and\nfor the development once again of an\nindependent mentality. It should also\nprove to be a step which will hopefully re-ignite and enhance this once-celebrated rivalry, whilst also serving\nto safeguard many other aspects of the\nRSM\u2019s rich history.\u201d\nThree years ago, a similar, but wider reaching, proposal was brought by\nthen Deputy President (Finance and\nServices), Jon Mathews as well as Danny Hill. Having failed in his first bid to\nreturn the Union status of the RSM,\nMr Hill was thrilled to have his paper\npassed this time.\nHe told felix: \u201cI am thrilled that at\nlong last the Royal School of Mines\nwill be recognised by Imperial College Union in the way it should be - as\na Constituent Union of ICU. Unlike a\nfaculty Union (E.g. City & Guilds College Union), the RSM won\u2019t provide\nwelfare and academic support to its\nstudents, however, it shall continue to\nco-ordinate student activities targeted\nat the students of the Royal School of\nMines, and be the governing committee of the RSM clubs and societies.\nWith RSM having many traditions that\nare older than Imperial College itself,\nthis is a vital step towards preserving\nthe Royal School of Mines identity and\ntraditions.\u201d\nJust as it does in the Union bar, the Royal School of Mines will stand alongside College\u2019s Faculty Unions from next year\n\n"

    "content": "8 felix FRIDAY 11 JUNE 2010\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPOLITICAL COMMENT\nL\nast Saturday saw the seizure of the flotilla \u201cRachel\nCorrie\u201d by Israeli Defense Forces. The incident\nturned out to be very uneventful and the flotilla,\ncarrying aid and building materials to Gaza, was\nshepherded off to the port of Ashdod, Israel. The\nevent would probably have gone without much attention\nhad the events of Monday 31st May not occurred and cast a\nsomber spotlight upon the three year long Israeli blockade\nof Gaza.\nJust like the Rachel Corrie, the Mavi Marmara was carrying aid and building materials, and was similarly boarded\nby the IDF in international waters. But in stark contrast, the\nincident resulted in the killing of nine people and left twenty\npeople injured. The specific details of the incident are less\nclear. The Israeli government insisted, and continues to do\nso, that IDF commandos acted in self defense and Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu said \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a love boat.\nThis was a hate boat\u201d. The Israeli Government also released\nvideo footage showing commandos encountering resistance by activists with metal bars and chairs after they had\ndropped on the deck of the Mavi Marmara.\nYet eye witness accounts report a rather contradictory\nstory, notably that IDF commandos fired upon the passengers first, with many reporting shots were fired by troops\nbefore they had even landed onboard the ship. Israel is yet\nto release the full recording of the footage captured of the\nattack. Critically, gunshot wounds to many of the dead show\naccurate aiming of shots to the forehead, the back of the\nchest and the heart, raising the question of whether Israeli\nsoldiers acted in self defense.\nThe response by the International Community was im-mediate. World leaders expressed their concern to varying\ndegrees, with President Obama expressing \u201cdeep regret\u201d\nover the loss of lives and President Sarkozy condemning\nthe use of \u201cdisproportionate force\u201d. However, the message\nwas clear. Israel was wrong to do what it did. No more\nwas this evident than in Turkey\u2019s parliament the next day,\nwhere President Ergoden said \u201cIsrael in no way can legitimize this murder, it cannot wash its hands of this blood\u201d.\nProtest around the world ensued and under Arab anger\nat Egypt\u2019s complicity in the blockade, President Mubarak\nordered the Rafah border crossing to finally be opened\nindefinitely. The United Nations Security Council finally\ncalled upon Israel to ensure a \u201cprompt, impartial, credible\nand transparent\u201d investigation to take place. Israel, however,\nrefused to allow such investigation, stating only an Israeli\ninvestigation in conjunction with the United States could\npossibly be considered. Yet amongst all the international\npolitics, a serious question must be posed: how did such a\nsituation, where 1.5 million Palestinian people are prisoners\nwithin their own lands, ever come to pass?\nThe blockade of Gaza has widely been condemned by the\nInternational Community, and Israel was told by the United\nNations and the International Court of Justice to lift the\nblockade. Unfortunately Israel was not listening and it\u2019s not\nthe first time. It was only in February that President Obama\ncalled for the immediate halt of Israeli settlement construction in Arab East Jerusalem. However, President Netanyahu\nseemed not to listen. The very next day construction work\nwent on as usual. The controversial Gaza-Israel wall was\nwidely criticized at the time of its construction and the International Court of Justice passed the ruling declaring it\n\u201cfinds the Israel barrier in Palestinian territory is illegal.\u201d\nAgain Israel ignored the call and completed the wall anyway.\nYet the most controversial of all Israel\u2019s policy has been the\nbuilding of settlements on Occupied Palestinian Territories\nsince the six-day war in 1967.\nAccording to UN Security Council Resolutions 446 & 465\nthe settlements have \u201cno legal validity\u201d and \u201cshould be dismantled\u201d. International law states that the building of settlements on occupied land is illegal. Despite this, Israel continues to build settlements at the expense of the livelihoods of\nthe Palestinian people.\nSo where does Israel go from here? Humanitarian groups\nsuch as FreeGaza and StopTheWar Coalition have insisted\nmore flotillas will be sent and Iran has stated that if necessary it will deploy Revolutionary Guard naval ships to escort\nthe next convoy of 60 aid ships heading for Gaza, further\nraising political tensions in the region.\nThe very blockade itself, the source of so much pain,\nis now being viewed in a somewhat new light by western\nnations, with US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton declaring the siege as \u201cunsustainable\u201d and the foreign shadow\nsecretary David Miliband saying the blockade is \u201ca stain\non policy right across the Middle East\u201d. And as Israel relations with Turkey, the only Muslim country in NATO,\nreach breaking point, the near isolation that Israel now\nfinds itself in on a global stage is also a very dangerous and\nworrying one. In a recent interview Norman Finklestein,\nan American author widely regarded as one of the best experts on the Israeli \u2013 Palestinian conflict, said that \u201cIsrael\nis now a lunatic state. It\u2019s a lunatic state with between two\nand three hundred nuclear devices. It is threatening war\ndaily.\u201d\nIsrael has for too long been allowed to dictate policy in\nthe region unchecked and without consequence. This was\nmade apparent not only by the excessive and the totally\nunnecessary use of force on the Mavi Mamara, but also\nin 2008\u2019s appalling and horrendous attack on Gaza, code\nnamed \u201cCast Lead\u201d, where disproportionate force lead to\nthe death of 1,400 Palestinians.\nSurely then, it is time for Israel to finally accept reality,\nthat whether by international help or the pure determination and spirit of the Palestinian people, the state of Palestine and the Palestinian people are going nowhere, and\nthey want their freedom. In the same token, it is time the\nlikes of America, Britain, Europe and even more impor-tantly, the Arab nations manned up and took a decisive\nrole in ending this 60 year conflict, for the sake of both Palestinians and Israelis, before more innocent lives are lost.\nHas Israel Gone Too Far?\nWith pressure mounting on Israel, will world leaders finally put\nan end to Israel\u2019s continuing expansion at the expense of the\nPalestinian people? By Aslam Shamsuddin\n\u201cIsrael continues to\nbuild settlements at the\nexpense of the livelihoods\nof the Palestinian\npeople.\u201d\n\u201cIsrael in no way can\nlegitimize this murder, it\ncannot wash its hands of\nthis blood\u201d\nThe MV Rachel Corrie, an aid\nship which was also part of the\nintercepted Freedom Flotilla\nis named after a 23-year old\nAmerican activist killed in Gaza\nin 2003\n\n"

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 11 JUNE 2010\nA\ns the summer holidays\ndraw closer, I am thinking more and more about\none of my favourite activities during the break.\nI like to travel, to go places. It can be\na family holiday to the sunny shores\nof Rhyl and beyond or simply exploring the woodland paths and country\nlanes delightfully close to home. Travel\nexpands the mind and broadens the\nhorizon. They say a change is as good\nas a rest.\nAnother thing travel is good for is\nthe vocabulary, especially in London.\nYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many four-lettered curses you could fit into a\nsingle sentence until you hear them\nfirst-hand from a vociferous cabbie on\nExhibition Road. But this highlights an\nimportant point. Travelling in London\nis a nightmare at best and lethal at its\nworst.\nFirstly, there is the Underground.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: my love for the\nTube is as strong as it was on my first\ntrip to Gloucester Road. But it is not\nwithout its faults. For one thing, it can\nbe a mite crowded, especially in the\never-expanding realms of rush-hour.\nI like a game of sardines as much as\nthe next man but the average level of\npersonal hygiene underground is far\nbelow acceptable. Also, there is the\nconstant engineering work at week-ends. Of course it\u2019s necessary but on\nthose rare occasions when both the\nDistrict and Piccadilly lines are down,\nI find myself uncomfortably stranded\nin West London. And not the good\npart of West London either.\nOf course I could always take the bus\nif the rails proved too much of a hassle.\nBut these aren\u2019t perfect either. They\nsuffer from the same terminal problem of overcrowding as the trains. And\nwhile the provision of service is more\nconsistent, the speed can be a bit er-ratic. I have known buses on the same\nroute take between twenty and eighty\nminutes to cover the same distance.\nYou would be better off planning your\nday according to bird entrails.\nBut it\u2019s not the buses\u2019 fault. They use\nthe roads but not exclusively; cars, lor-ries, bikes, taxis all compete for space\non the tarmacadam. This confuses\nme in part: why would anyone drive\nin London when it\u2019s always so busy\nwith people driving in London? If you\ndon\u2019t get run over by a lorry, you\u2019re not\nmuch better off in a taxi. At best, you\u2019ll\nbe broke by the end of it and, at worst,\nraped. Getting to college is important,\ntrue, but there are limits.\nGetting around under your own\nsteam is fine enough but still not per-fect. Only when walking from A to B\ndo you get an idea of how big London\nreally is. Turns out it\u2019s actually bigger\nthan China. And due to numerous\nbike safety laws, all cyclists must wear\na target on their back for all other motorists to aim for. Minor injuries are\nworth ten points, with a fatality worth\nfifty! And should you make it to your\ndestination in one piece, and on time,\nyou are guaranteed to be covered in a\nthin, unwholesome patina of sweat.\nSo what is the solution? I think, after\nsome careful research at London Zoo,\nI may have stumbled upon the perfect\nmode of metropolitan transportation.\nAs befitting the prince among cities, it\nis the prince among birds: the ostrich.\nFor one, it won\u2019t be crowded since\nthere\u2019ll only be room for you and your\nsatchel on the back of an ostrich. Likewise, travel by ostrich is fast and con-sistent. With a top speed of 45mph, it\nis the fastest of all birds on land\u2014and\nwhen riding it, you\u2019ll be the fastest\nthing in London. And when the roads\nclog up with traffic, you can simply\ntake to the pavements. If people can\nwalk their dogs on the pavements, I\ndon\u2019t see why you can\u2019t walk (or ride)\nyour ostrich. Most importantly, this is\njust faster than the commuter\u2019s only\nnatural predator, the leopard.\nFurthermore, reliability and security\ngo hand in hand. For a start, ostriches\ncan live for up to forty-five years\u2014not\neven a well-oiled bike will stand up for\nthat long. Secondly, ostriches are notoriously bad-tempered but this can\nwork in your favour. Any would-be\nthief would quickly get the shit kicked\nout of him. However, their mean bite\nand kick can make them hard to han-dle. The only way to properly subdue\nan ostrich is to beat it in a wrestling\nmatch. Only then will its pride allow it\nto acknowledge you as its master. After that, they\u2019re like kittens.\nSo if in the next few weeks you see a\nman-on-ostrich-shaped blur go by on\nQueen\u2019s Gate, why not give a wave? I\nwould stop and say hello, but I haven\u2019t\nyet worked out how to brake.\n\u201cDue to numerous\nbike safety laws, all\ncyclists must wear\na target on their\nback for motorists\nto aim at\u201d\nRhys Davies finds alternate modes of transport\nJenny Wilson on the opportunities to volunteer\nI\nf you haven\u2019t heard that we have\naround 300 Clubs & Societies\nat Imperial, you have probably\nbeen spending a bit too much\ntime in the library\u2014in which\ncase you might like to join Book Club.\nNot to belittle my own job, but when\nit comes down to it, Clubs & Societies\nare there for us to have fun or be en-tertained. The point here is that this is\nall for us, which is great. However, the\nsystem in which clubs exist is tailored\nto that purpose, and it works well\u2014we\nknow it does because that\u2019s how we are\nable to sustain them all. If you haven\u2019t\nbeen a club officer yourself, you may\nnot know that to survive as a club you\nhave to have at least twenty members,\nand to be eligible for Union grant you\nhave to charge members at least \u00a32\neach.\nOne thing that clubs aren\u2019t geared\ntowards is helping people outside\nthe student population. Sure, there\nis the Imperial Volunteer Centre\n(www.imperial.ac.uk/volunteering)\nand you could just go get involved\nwith the community in other ways.\nQuite frankly, up until now the Union has been pretty bad at supporting\nstudent-led activities that don\u2019t have\nour students as the primary focus.\nOnly recently has there been a shift\nin attitude away from only supporting\nstudents, towards support for us and\nthe community. While it may seem\ncontroversial to use up the Union\u2019s\nresources on voluntary and charitable\nwork, there have been two strong arguments in favour of this.\nThe first is that the Union is here\nfor its students and to serve their\ninterests. I know from being at the\nreceiving end of many New Club Application forms that there is a genuine interest from our students to look\nfurther afield than the fortress-like\nwalls of our campus. We are fortunate\nin that we have a plentiful supply of\nintelligent people who would probably like a career. It so happens that in\nlife after university, you will probably\nhave to interact with sections of the\ncommunity that haven\u2019t got a degree\nin science, engineering or medicine.\nSo why not start now?\nFollowing on from that, in an age\nof graduate employment doom and\ngloom many employers like to see\nsome interaction with the real world\nand doing something that engages\nwith that world can really help. Most\nvolunteering projects have an element\nof skills development, or provide opportunities for you to be put into\nan environment that you wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily come into contact with\notherwise.\nSo what has the Union done to actively change this culture? Please wel-come: Projects. These are the new\nsiblings to the Club & Society family.\nThey have ninety per cent of the same\nprivileges as clubs, and a few perks\nof their own. Standard things to ex-pect, for instance, are a stall at Freshers\u2019 Fair, use of the Student Activities\nCentre and the ability to book rooms.\nIt seems a bit backward that to\nvolunteer in the community or to\ndo charity fundraising you must pay\nmembership to be a part of the group,\nso Projects don\u2019t have to charge a\nmembership fee. If you need T-shirts\nor name badges for volunteers, there\nis a pot of money in the Union put\naside for this purpose. Also, if there\nare five of you who want, say, to help\nthe elderly learn to use computers,\nwhy should you be rejected owing to\npaucity of numbers? If only a few of\nyou can commit to helping out, is it\nfair for you not to be recognised by\nthe Union? Any number of people can\nmake a positive difference, and give\nthe Union a better reputation from\nthe outside.\nSo where is the line drawn between\nClubs & Societies and Projects? If\nyour primary intention is helping oth-ers, either by raising money for charity or helping the local, national or international community, then a Project\nis what you are working on.\nA good example is IC Buddies, set\nup at the beginning of this academic\nyear, which is an outreach Project that\nhelps local schools with teaching science subjects. Projects like this will\nbe grouped with others in the rein-vigorated Community Action Group\n(CAG). Similarly, those groups raising money for charity will become\nProjects in RAG, meaning that when\nthe Union tots up how much we\ngive to charity, we\u2019ll just have to add\nup RAG\u2019s profit for the year. All this\ncomes under the remit of the Deputy\nPresident (Welfare).\nIn summary, we\u2019re hoping that this\nnew, more streamlined system will\nhelp students interact with the wider\ncommunity in a more co-ordinated\nway. Hopefully, you\u2019ll be hearing more\nabout Projects in the near future.\n\u201cOnly recently have\nstudents started\noffering support\ntowards the Union\nand the wider\ncommunity\u201d\n\n"
