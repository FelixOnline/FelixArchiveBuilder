The Queen's Tower Boat\nClub also had two crews racing.\nThe squad had been hit by injury\nand illness in the final few days of\nprep e ration for this event, with\nsome last minute changes of key\npersonnel being enforced. This\nproved to be critical in the very\ntough competition. IC's senior 1\ncox ed four were the only boat to\nwin their division outright, finishing\nwell up in the overall order, on\ntimes. Several crews were only\nseconds off the pace, often losing\nout to crews who had started later\nin the day and had taken advantage\nof the greater tide. There was also\nsome dispute over the correction of\nthe provisional results which had\nled to two IC crews being denied\npennants.\nBoth the Queen's Tower boats\nwon their divisions (senior 2 cox ed, and women's cox less fours).\nThe club is now back in pairs and\nsingle sculls, laying the groundwork\nfor the summer regatta season.\nResults:\nIC Boat Finish position\n1 17th233 rd Winners of\nsenior \"1\" category.\n3 49th493 rd599 th6112 th7121 st8217 th A total of 481 crews raced.\nWith both teams needing a win to\nprogress to the next round of the\nU AU competition, this was always\ngoing to be a needle game. We\ncame out with the right attitude and\na team of committed players ready\nto rise to the occasion. A few well\nqualified newcomers bolstered our\nimpressive line-up; the stage was\nset.\nAfter conceding our traditional\nwarm-up goal, we fought back and\nas carey one man effort by Steve\nLaw brought the scores level. We\nthen dominated the first half with\nexcellent midfield passing play from\nEddy, Samin and John F. It was just\nthat the final touch was lacking;\nsometimes courtesy of those 'men\nin black'. Then Holloway were\nawarded a cons ciliary penalty flick\nfrom a front break. They made no\nmistake in converting, and we went\ninto half time 2\u20141 down.\nThe second half started with us\napplying constant pressure, earning\nmany short corners. John Brooks\nfinally put away our overdue goal,\nfrom a narrow angle. We had high\nhopes for the last fifteen minutes,\nbut alas it was not to be. We piled\non the pressure and Holloway\nresponded in the only way they\nknew how: they scored their third\ngoal with ten minutes to go and\nthings were not rosy in the State of\nHarlington. A prolonged series of\nshort corners didn't result in\nanything tangible, and Holloway\ntook advantage to put the game\nbeyond our reach. (2\u20144).\nIt was our strongest team of the\nseason and there was no shame in\nthe result. We gave our best but\ncame up short, like a one legged\nlong jumper.\nTeam: S Curwood, M Helayel,\nD Parkinson, P Higgin, I Haines,\nJ Brooks, J Furlong, E Penfold, S Ishtiaq, S Lam, J Jordan, D Fairhurst (S). IC Rugby 2nds IC RFC2 nd IV 3 - RHBNC 0\nFor the last game in the first round\n.of the U AU, IC seconds needed to\npull a win out of the bag. After a concerted effort from the kick-off\nLee Jefferson turned a penalty into\npoints mid-way through the first\nhalf. There were plenty of good\ndrives by IC, and excellent forward\nplay led by Keith Simpson on the\nflank. Rucks and mauls came out in\nour favour due to our quick second\nand back rows driving New college\ndown the pitch all the time, and\ngood cover from hooker Ivor\nCrampse and the two props Simon\nFuller and Glenn Khoo.\nDue to the clean forward play the\nbacks were delivered with lots of\nnice ball. Captain Karl Dfage, fed\nby centres James Wood and Steffan\nTudor, made some ground into\n'crash ball' situations, lining up\nsecond phase again for the\nforwards. Plenty of runs ended with\nno points, to credit RHBNC's defence so close to the goal line.\nThe 3-0 score allowed New college\nto press u rise us a little in the last\nhalf, but reflecting the play the\nscore should h ve been more like\n30-0.\nIC l st's continued their quest for the\nLeague Title on Saturday (14th Nov) by defeating current League\nHolders, Kings College with a score\nof 2-1.\nOn a cold and rainy day IC\narrived at Kings College's sports ground having no intention of\nleaving as losers.\nA Galloway did a brilliant team\ntalk, storming into the changing\nrooms shouting, T hate Jim, let's kill Jim, let's f**k King's!', reference being made to Jim the\nKings trainer.\nWe went into the game very\nstrongly, and after missing a few\nchances finally scored with a glancing header from A Galloway,\nIC's leading.goal scorer. Kings\nmanaged to pull one back before\nhalf time, but IC's skill and spirit\nwere to shine in the second half.\nIC's dominance in the beginning\nof the second half was rewarded by\na goal from the edge of the box by\nR Martinez. IC then cool y held off\nthe King's attacks, with the defense\ncomposed of R Burrows, R Bruce,\nT Robson and A Feuton, all playing\nbrilliantly.\nJ Mottashed and R Dixon played\nsome great control football on the\nleft, whist T Botzios and R Galloway on the right bedazzled the\nKing's defense with some great\nruns, and particularly with a one-two back heel move.\nS Watson and R Martinez took\ncomplete control of the centre\nmidfield, leaving M Atherton to do\nmostly routine work.\nA great team effort which leaves\nevey one in the football club\noptimistic for the future.\nNorfolk Dribs\nUEA3 DRIBBLERS 0\nFollowing a ridiculously early start\n(7.30am) the Dribbers made their\nway to Norwich via tube, train, bus,\nanother train and finally taxi. Kickoff was at 1 lam, we got there at half\npast. They had a full team, we had\neight. Captain Eleanor chose a good\nweekend to be unavailable, as she\nmissed the finest football ever\nplayed by the Dribblers.\nNovice keeper Jane played well,\ntip inga free kick over the cross-bar\nand saving numerous other attempts\nby UEA. Unlike Wednesday,\nJuliette did not score, neither did\nChristine, though not through want\nof trying. Fresh from refereeing on\nSaturday Julianna took a new lease\nof life, along with Paula (whose\nvoice proved inversely proportional\nto her diminutive size). Beej ran like\nan international athlete reaching\nseemingly impossible-to-get balls,\nwhilst Arlene and Sharon were\nforced to defend like never before,\nmaking it appear almost effortless.\nUEA were lucky to score at all\nreally, but as usual the Dribblers\nwere victorious in the main event\n- the after-match boat race!\nRESULTS TABLE\nUAU 19.11.92\nm peri al College vs Royal Holloway BNC\nASSOCIATION FOOTBALL HOCKEY (WOMEN)\nI.C.132 RHBNC 1 IC 1 1-4 RHBNC 1\nIC 2 2-2 RHBNC 2 IC 2 1-1 RHBNC 2\nIC 3 3-2' RHBNC 3\nIC 4 0-0 RHBNC 4 NETBALL\nIC 1 27-21 RHBNC 1\nBADMINTON (MEN)\nIC 1 7-2 RHBNC 1 RUGBY UNION\nIC 2 9-0 RHBNC 2 IC 1 26-6 RHBNC 1\nIC 2 3-0 RHBNC 2\nBADMINTON (WOMEN)\nIC 7-2 RHBNC WINTER TENNIS (MEN)\nIC 4-2 RHBNC\nGOLF\nic v kv k RHBNC WINTER TENNIS (WOMEN)\nIC 0-6 RHBNC\nHOCKEY (MEN)\nIC 1 2-4 RHBNC 1 UAU Matches were played at home.\nIC 2 3-2 RHBNC 2\nIC 3 0-5 RHBNC 3 FOOTBALL 14.11.92 (not UAU)\nIC 3 0-5 RSM 1\n^pm W^ MB* Felix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union\nMam kh jp\".

    "content": "'eat ure20 November 1992 Felix 949\nThe London Film Festival\nSimon Su and David Spooner peruse the delights offered this year, and\nrecommend the best of the capitals annual movie gala.\nThe London Film Festival\nThe 36th London Film Festival will\nbe, at the time of your reading this,\nan event halfway through its tenure.\nNow, please; do not be\ndiscouraged, because this should\nnot dissuade you from attending the\nremaining excellent features.\nThe festival is, of course,\ncategorised in different sections; the\n'Film on the Square' section, for\nexample, is comprised of generally\nmainstream features, presumably to\njustify its place in Leicester Square.\nHerein, then, two Bob De Niro\nflicks- 'Mistress' and 'Night and the\nCity'- and two Whoopie Goldberg\nflicks- to whit, 'Sarafina' and\n'Sister Act', the latter seeing La\nGoldberg as 'an undercover cop in\ndisguise as a nun'... events ensue\nwith, no doubt, hilarious\nconsequences...\nFrom the comfy sitcom my stuff,\nto the Highbrow, or perhaps not.\nAlan Rudolph returns after the\nacclaim of 'The Moderns', with a film called 'Equinox', and Bruce\nBeresford brings to our attention his\nlatest effort, 'Rich in Love' with\nAlbert Finney. The hallowed name\nof Ridley Scott (bow, close eyes and\nintone darkly in homage) makes\nitself once more accessible with his\never-so-slight re-working of\n' BLADERUNNER'!!! Rest\nassured, dear reader, we shan't spoil it for you. Gits won't let us\nsee it, will they? Still,\n' BLADERUNNER'!!! goes on\ngeneral release in the next few\nmonths, as does the rest of this\nbounteous celluloid output.\nWith a quip, and a skip, and a merry heave-ho, we look next at the\n'U.S. Independents' section; the\nphrase here is 'up-and-coming',\ndon'tch a know, kids. So, yeah,\ncheck out Joel Hershman's first\nfeature 'Hold me, Thrill me, Kiss\nme', described as 'Almodovar and\nJohn Waters teaming up on a90's love story'. Carl Franklin, a black\nAmerican director makes his debut\nwith 'One False Move', an\napparently subtle exploration of\nsexual and racial relationships. Of\nBlade Runner, the directors cut.\nparticular interest, 'The Living\nEnd', described as 'An alternative\nThelma & Louise', and involving\ntwo HIV-positive boys escaping\ntheir rather terminal situation in a gleeful voyage into sex, violence,\nand indulgence. A somewhat\noffbeat, but nonetheless, interesting\naddition to the festival.\nDear old Sir Kenny O 'Lovey, Mr\nBranagh to the rest of you, has his\nlatest work 'Peter's Friends' also on\nshow, and those stalwart\nworkhorses Julie Walters, Jeanne\nMoreau, and Mrs Olivier herself,\nJoan Plowright, will be dead cert s for plum performances in 'The\nClothes in the Wardrobe'. A Hellraiser 3\ndocumentary, entitled 'The\nExecution Protocol', follows the\nlives of three convicted murderers,\none of whom came pretty close to\nmeeting his maker. Who said the\nBritish Film Industry was dead,\neh?.\nMoving on, now, to films from\nall over the world, and a fair\nselection of famous names we have\nhere. Eric Rohmer, Jean-Jacques\nBeineix, Claude Chabrol and\nLuchino Visconti amongst others.\nSome forty other films from\nEurope, twenty from Asia, and a further ten from Africa are\nfeatured. Zhang Yimou, a festival\nfave from China, has his latest\noffering, 'The Story of Qui Ju'\nincluded in this year's presentation.\nThis film has already claimed the\nGolden Lion and 'Best Actress'\naward at the Venice Film Festival.\nCarmen Maura, European Actress\nof 1990, makes her debut in French\nfilm called 'On Earth as in Heaven'.\nBig names aside, be adventurous;\nall 'big names' were 'unknowns' to\nbegin with.\nAs if that wasn't enough, Mike\nLeigh directs the festival trailer; this\nhe did last year, and was a rare old\nmirth-filled rib tickle r. Happy\nViewing.\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "N ews\n20 November 1992 Felix 949\nBirkbeck President fights back\nby Gareth Light\nBarbara Bates, the president of\nBirkbeck College Students' Union,\nfaced down a motion of no\nconfidence yesterday. The motion\nwas tabled by David Gascoigne, a PhD crystallography student, who\naccused Ms Bates of incompetence\nand irresponsible financial practice.\nMr Gascoigne, also a member of\nBirkbeck Students' Union Council,\nhas been described by Ms Bates as\n'mad'.\nThe dispute follows an\n\u2022investigation into Birkbeck\nStudents' Union Bar. A financial\nreport on the bar was drawn up by\nthe University of London Union and\na team of accountants. Four formal\ncomplaints were lodged against\nJohn Kerranson, the Bar Manager,\nas a result of the inquiry. It was also\nalleged that \u00a311,000 had 'gone\nmissing' from the bar's finances.\nThe Bar Inquiry was launched by\nMs Bates after disquiet about the\nbar's finances. Ms Bates has\ninsinuated that the inquiry was\nhindered by the Union Council,\nwhich includes several members of\nbar staff, including Mr Gascoigne.\nMr Gascoigne was last week\naccused by Ms Bates of 'waging a personal vendetta' against her. She\nalso alleged that Mr Gascoigne, a flat mate and colleague of Mr Kerranson, is in breach of the\nUnion's constitution by both\nserving on the Union Council and\nworking as a Union employee.\nMr Gascoigne has accused Ms\nBates of awarding Union contracts\nto 'close friends', and of making\nirregular payments from the\nUnion's petty cash, though he says\nthat any suggestion of dishonesty is\n'merely coincidental'. Ms Bates is\nreported to have told Mr Gascoigne\nthat she was 'going to rip (his)\nbollocks off and shove them up (his)\narse,' something she has since\ndenied. A vote on the motion was\npending as Felix went to press.\nLoans update Security Changes\nby Felix reporters\nThe take up rate for the government\nstudent loan is up by 61% on last\nyear. The figures apply to the first\nfour weeks of the academic year,\nand have been released by the\nStudent Loans Company. The\nCompany reports 82,000\"\napplications so far this year and\nexpects 350,000 loans to be taken\nout by July. This is 10,000 more\nloans than were taken out in total\nin the first two years of the loan\nscheme.\nLatest figures show that of\n56,800 student due to start\nrepayment of the loan in April,\n32,000 are paying on time, 20,400\nhave had their payments deferred,\nand 72 court summonses have been\nissued to defaulters. Borrowers can\nhave their repayments deferred if\nthey are unemployed or if they are\nearning less than 85% of national\naverage earnings.\nDespite the increased take up of the loans, and the continued\nfreezing of the level of student\ngrants, college welfare sources\nreport that there have been few\nstudents at Imperial complaining of\nhardship so far this term. Stefano\nRuis, Imperial College Union's Welfare Officer, commented that\nthere had been 'no significant\nnumbers' of students coming to Him with cases of financial problems.\nThis view has been supported by\nDon Adlington, College's Student\nCounsellor, who revealed that most\nof the students coming to him were\noverseas postgraduates, mainly with\nproblems concerning their funding.\nMr Adlington said that this may be\ndue to undergraduates in financial\ndifficulties going straight to other\npeople, such as their bank\nmanagers, rather than seeking\ncounselling.\nImperial's circumstances seem to\nbe unique in the University of\nLondon. Eleanor Merton, Vice\nPresident of Communication and\nWelfare at the University of London\nUnion (ULU), told Felix that the\nlevel of student hardship in the\nUniversity of London has not\ndecreased this year, although more\nstudents appear to be aware of\nfinancial problems before they start\ntheir courses. Ms Merton added that\nmany University of London\ncolleges, now having more financial\nindependence, are dealing internally\nwith hardship, rather than going\nthrough University of London\nchannels.\nby the News Editor\nA review of Union security is\nunderway following an assault on\na female student in the Union\nBuilding last Saturday. Union\nsecurity staff face retraining, and a male student will appear before the\nUnion disciplinary committee to\nexplain his alleged role in the\nassault.\nThe attack took place in the Ents\nlounge in the early hours of\nSaturday morning, close to the end\nof the 'Atmosphere' disco. The\nvictim told me that she was dancing\nnear the middle of the floor, when\nshe noticed a large group of\nstudents, mostly male, surging\ntowards her. As she attempted to\nget of their way, she says she was\npushed forward by the group\ntowards the stage. She crashed into\nthe side of the stage, and then fell\nforwards onto it, injuring her knee\nand leg. At this point, she claims\nshe was kicked about the upper\nbody by one of the students, causing\ncuts and bruising. She said,' I was\nlying flat on my face, and he kicked\nme hard, with intent'.\nAt this stage, it is claimed that the\nman walked away from the victim,\nwho then got up from the floor of\nthe stage, and confronted him. After\nsome jostling and an exchange of\nopinions, she was pushed upwards\ninto the air and off the stage, before\ncrashing into the crowd. The victim\nthen says that she identified her\nattacker to one of the Union\nStewards on duty. The victim\nclaims that she was not given\nadequate first aid, or advised of any\nprocedure by which a disciplinary\naction could be taken against her\nalleged attacker.\nIn a statement to i CNN, Rick\nBilby, Deputy President of Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU), wrote that the\njob description of Union Steward is\ncurrently under review, and that\nStewards currently have the same\nresponsibilities as last year's Duty\nOfficers. Mr Bilby added that\nUnion Stewards will be trained in\nfirst aid, basic law and security\nprocedures 'in the near future',\nsubject to confirmation from the\nMetropolitan Police. Mr Bilby also\nwrote that the student accused of\nmaking the assault will be asked by\nthe Union disciplinary committee to\nmake a statement 'for its\nconsideration'. Mr Bilby would not\nmake any further verbal comment.\nThe Union Steward named by the\nvictim also declined to comment,\nsaying he did not want to prejudice\nany forthcoming Union disciplinary\nhearing.\nCatering Laws affect Imperial Students by Sangkaran Ratnam\nImperial College Catering\nCommittee is now enforcing\nlegislation on the sale and provision\nof food at the College. The rules,\nbased on existing laws, have only\nrecently been enforced. According\nto the legislation, public functions\nheld for more than fifty people must\nhave food supplied by qualified\ncatering staff. If less than fifty\npeople are in attendance then cold\nfood and drinks may be served.\nThe major groups affected in\nImperial are the overseas students\nsocieties. Yen Yang Lim, Overseas\nStudents Committee (OSC)\nchairman, explained that food forms\na major part of OSC society\nfunctions, with societies fulfilling\ntheir cons it ut ions by promoting\ntheir culture to non-nationals. He\nexpressed his concern that the new\nregulations may restrict such\nactivities.\nIt is believed that senior College\nfigures have banned the use of\nexternal catering firms for any\nfunction within College buildings.\nThis means that, to comply with the\nnew laws, societies must use\nCollege caterers for any food-based\nevents. It is feared that this may\ndissuade societies from holding\ntheir activities on College premises.\nThe Malaysian society held its\nDeepavali Celebration at Malaysia\nHall near Marble Arch, after\nImperial College Union refused\npermission for the event. Concern\nhas been expressed by many\nsocieties at the extra cost to\nOverseas groups of using College\nand other catering firms.\nThe issue will be discussed by the\nImperial College Union Bar and\nCatering Committee later today.\nSome societies hope that some of\nthe College and environmental\nhealth regulations can be relaxed\nafter this meeting. Chris Davidson,\nImperial College Union President,\nhas urged individual societies to\nabide by the general ruling whilst\nwaiting for any changes. He added\nthat whatever the outcome of the\ncommittee meeting, some events\nwould have to change or in some\ncases would not be held at all.\nWhen asked what would happen if\nthe rules were broken, Mr. Davidson said that a Union\ndisciplinary committee could\nremove the right to hire rooms\nwithin the Union if rules were\nbroken.\nThe first day of this week's Overseas Students' Week saw many\nsocieties selling food and drink at\ntheir stalls. One society president,\nwho declined to be named, said that\nthough he had been warned not to\nsell foodstuff, other so cities continued to do so and so his society\ndid the same. He added that no\nUnion Officers were present to stop\nsuch activities.\nage 2\n\n"

I would love to\nsay that this works; I would never\nbe away from this theatre if it was\nso, but the representation is as\nclumsy as expected, it is virtually\nimpossible to avoid being so.

Unfortunately the\nreal tragedy of this ending was that\nthe audience laughed.

To most of\nyou this is going to seem a pretty\nobvious statement, but only thirty\nyears ago, people in this country\nand elsewhere were struggling for\nlegislation that would acknowledge\nthis. In yesterday's society the fact\nthat there is a basic human dignity,\nregardless of colour or race, was\ndenied. Racism and bigotry were\nseen to be an implicit part of human\nnature, and those individuals who\nwere trying to change this\nperception were seen to be idealistic\nand naive.\nIn The Present\nIt would be wrong to say that\nracism no longer plays a part in our\nsociety, but what I would like to\nsuggest is that we now recognise\nthat bigotry is taught. People are not\nborn racists or bigots, and when we\nrecognise racist attitudes within\nourselves it is not something we are\nproud of.\nIn The Future\nWhat I'd like people to realise is\nthat the idealists of today's society,\nthose who have the guts to stand up\nfor what they believe in, are going\nto change the way of the world. I'm tired of listening to the cynics who\ninsist that nothing ever changes, and\nif it does, then it's not because of\nthe likes of us. They're wrong. We\nare in an ever changing world, and\nthings only ever improve because\nof individuals who become aware\nof an injustice, and set about, in\ntheir own small way, to right a wrong. This has been shown to be\ntrue time and time again over many\ngenerations. Nothing positive has\never been achieved through\ncynicism and apathy.\nTime For A Change\nWe belong to a national student's movement called Third World\nFirst. Together with groups in\nuniversities and colleges throughout\nBritain, we campaign against the\nroot causes of poverty. We\nrecognise that the legacy of\ncolonialism, unequal terms of trade,\nthe enormous burden of debt and\nenvironmental degradation all\ncontribute to ensure that the poor\nare getting poorer. At the moment\nit is dictated that the price we pay\nfor our comfort is in terms of\nhuman misery. We say that greed\nis an implicit part of human nature.\nThat may be so, but I think the time\nhas come to stop applauding the\ngreedy and to recognise that greed\nis a bad thing.\nWe say that greed is an\nimplicit part of human\nnature ... but the time\nhas come to stop\napplauding the greedy\nand to recognise that\ngreed is a bad thing.\nCome along to one of our meetings in Southside Upper Lounge at l pm on Fridays. We also hold regular speaker meetings and show videos in\nthe Clubs Committee Room (top floor ofthe Union Building) at lunchtimes\non Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nPage 11\n\n"

Two jazz\narrangements of popular songs by\nDjango Bates (of the group 'Loose\nTubes') may work well for an\nensemble, but did not on solo piano.\nThe music took a more maniacal\nturn after the break, and thus\nbecame more interesting, with\n'Winnsboro' Cotton Mill Blues' by\nthe (still-living) American Frederic\nRzewski, a piece inhabiting the\ntrite.\nHowever the last track 'Thief\ninside' is an absolute classic, gentle\nintro with seemingly looney vocals,\nthe tinkering ivories chill your spine\nand the ending lyric of 'tap your\nheels together three times' leaves\nyou completely gob smacked.

Well Philips are not\ngiving out a lot of information, but\na quick trip to the encyclopaedia\nreveals that Albinoni was a contemporary of Bach and Handel,\ncomposing in Italy at the same time\nas Vivaldi. How does he rate\nagainst the competition? On the\nevidence of the Philips CD he rates\nvery highly; if you enjoy the Four\nSeasons then you will surely want\nto own this collection of six oboe\nconcertos. These are in the\ntraditional form of three contrasting\nmovements and provide a wonderful demonstration of\nbaroque composition and harmony.\nThe slow second movements in\nnumbers 2, 3 and 5 match anything\nI have heard before. In number 2\nthe oboe sings a beautiful sustained\nnote above I Musici that leaves the\nlistener breathless, in number 3 the\nmovement is as warm and\nlanguorous as an Italian summer\nafternoon should be, and then in\nnumber 5 you seem to move\nConcert\nTender is the North\u2014Nielsen\nThe Barbican's huge festival of all\nforms of Scandinavian Art opened\nlast week with a concert attended by\nno fewer than six heads of state\n(think of having to sit through all\nthose national anthems) and\ncontinues throughout November\nand into December with an\nambitious and comprehensive\nmixture of art, craft, theatre,\ncinema and music, supported by\nsponsorship from an encouragingly\nside range of sources including\nCarlsberg and the European Arts\nFestival.\nSimon Rattle and the City of\nBirmingham Symphony Orchestra\nbegan their three-concert cycle last\nFriday with the Brahms-influenced\nFirst Symphony and the mature\nThird, the Sinfonia Espansiva, truly\na mighty work. From the stabbing\nchords of its opening, Rattle\npropelled the first movement of the\nThird onwards to a huge first\nclimax, and then, unaccountably, he\nheld back for a fraction of a second\nbefore the wild, stomping waltz\nsteadily through a for zen lonely\nworld. It is good music to play to\nyour lover or for revision, but best\nof all for listening.\nThere is not much Albinoni in the\nrecord catalogues; if you want these\nconcertos, and you should, this\nrecording may be your only hope.\nThe soloists and I Musici use\nmodern instruments and the purists\nmay be disappointed by the absence\nof funny squeaks and squawks but\nthe playing was restrained and\ndisciplined and would have been\nquite acceptable to any self-respecting Venetian of the 18th century.\nThe bad news is the programme\nnotes; the fat little booklet seemed\nto promise all the information\nneeded for a standard pla gia rise d review: imagine disappointment\nwhen I found a one page biography\nof Heinz Holliger, two photographs\nof the same, and eight pages of\nadvertisements for Philips CDs.\nWhat a strain, I had to make all this\nup myself.

Since when do\nthe presidents of the CCU's have\nthe power to tell the Felix editor\nwhat to print? OK so he gets up\ntight about the avalanche of crap\nassociated with mascot ry that\nforever finds its way into the Felix\noffice, we all do. I suppose we\ncould destroy it before it reaches\nh irn and claim that we lost it\nbecause it is so hectic in Felix and\nthe place is swarming with people\nduring the day, (a situation NEVER encountered in the RCS office).\nThe Chancellor (or incompetent\ndick head as his title should be),\ngave his autumn speech last\nThursday and promised a whole\nlorry load of improvements that are\nneeded to boost the economy.\nAmong the lies was the promise to\ndecrease the public spending on the\nDept of Education.

I bet she can't even\nact and only uses the fact that\nRADA were stupid enough to let\nher in as something to put on her\nCV (in the list of her qualifications,\nafter the A level in Pride and\nHaughtiness and her degree in\nSnobbery and the Art of Appearing\nas the World's most Pretentious\nHuman).\nThe whole idea of the meetings in\nthe Ents lounge on Mondays is to\nmeet Chris Davidson (Ben from the\nBill+Ben posse) and to chat to him\ninformally about anything. I assumed that Chris would be mainly\ntalking about the proposed split with\nthe University of London and\nvoluntary membership of the\nUnion, but the real high point was\nwhen he was answering all manner\nof questions about his 'hip and\nh app 'nin\" haircut. As well as\nbragging about it immensely, he\nstrongly denied being sponsored for\nFelix 949\nthe haircut and diverted that line of\nquestioning to the fact that the\nhairdresser has sponsored him for\nthe Bungee Jump. Somehow I think\nthese meetings are not fulfilling\ntheir original purpose, especially\nsince half of the assembled crowd\nwere there as it was the nearest\nplace to sit and eat, rather than to\nsee the press ies' new hair.\nAccording to this week's Time Out,\nthere are half a million young,\nsingle women in London.

They also strongly\nadvise that Thursday and Saturday\nare the best days to try. Please!\nTop Gear really pisses me off.

No doubt that loyal watchers\ndrool more at the sight of a turbocharged engine with a twin camshaft than at the programme's only\nfemale presenter. Therefore it is fair\nto say that Top Gear is for the sad\nif not twisted members of the\nBritish public who find driving a car\nmore exhilarating than having sex.\nThe other part of the programme\nI hate is the hysterical manner in\nwhich the two male senile old farts,\noops I mean the two male\npresenters, parade around and\ninside the cars in a pathetic effort\nto describe everything from the seat\ncovers (very important!) to the 'feel\nof the gear-stick'.

    "content": "'eat ure20 November 1992 Felix 949\nAll Work And No Play Makes Jack A Don Adlington, the Student Counsellor, gives us a survival guide to studying\nat Imperial College, outlining the problems that can occur and suggesting\nmethods of dealing with them.\nProblems Do Occur\nGiven the entry qualification\ndemanded of students coming to\nImperial College, it is unlikely that\nanyone admitted will be incapable\nof working at degree level, and\nultimately of attaining a degree.\nUndergraduates already have\nexperience in studying and in\nexamination preparation by the time\nthey arrive here. Despite this, it is\nnot at all uncommon for students to\ndiscover that this does not guarantee\na smooth transition to successful\nstudy at university. The study skills\nand learning habits which brought\nsuccess at GCSE and 'A' levels may\nprove to be inadequate at university,\nand academic work becomes a problem. This is as likely to happen\nto the person with outstandingly\ngood ' A' level grades as to anyone\nelse, but it is always a de moral ising experience and it needs to be\nidentified and dealt with.\nReasons For Academic Problems\nThe Unrelenting Work-Load\nWhen first year undergraduates\nhave academic difficulties, it\nusually has more to do with the\nvolume and unrelenting nature of\nthe work-load, rather, than its\nintellectual level. Students who used\nto work in short intensive bursts\nbefore examinations and have not\nbeen used to week-in-week-out\neffort, may well find themselves in\ndifficulty.\nHalf-Heart id Learning\nLearning is an interactive process\ndemanding time, energy and\ncommitment. Effective learning\ncannot be done by half-hearted ly reading through lecture notes or\nhandouts. Responding to problem\nsheets, or group interaction in class\nwill be more fruitful.\nThinking Is Intrinsically Difficult\nIt can also be a vaguely unwelcome\nactivity, at least initially. Because\nof this we have a tendency to skirt\nround it. For many, the problem is\ngetting started. We think of other\nimportant, less demanding things to\ndo instead, like writing letters,\nwashing up or shopping.\nLack Of Self-Motivation\nStudents sometimes run into\ndifficulties because, for the first\ntime, their work is determined by\nminute-to-minute decisions as to\nhow they use their time. The moral\nconstraints of family or teachers are\nno longer there. The emphasis is on\nself-motivation.\nBalancing Work And Play\nIt can take a little time to find the\nbalance between the demands of\nwork and those of other interests.\nTime management is a skill that\nmust be acquired if it isn't there\nalready. Studying at university is a full time job, and is probably the\nhardest job most of us will ever do.\nIt inevitably involves trading in or\npostponing other desirable ends.\nLack Of Rewards\nAll psychological literature on\nlearning emphasises the importance\nof reward, and the notion that\nreward is central to effective\nlearning is related to successful\nstudy at university. The rewards of\nprestige, economic security and of\nfulfilling the expectations of one's family are the obvious ones. If these\nThere is a short booklet available\nin College called 'Study Success'.\nAsk your Senior Tutor or\ndepartmental office for a copy.\nthings are not valued sufficiently,\nthe resilience and buoyancy\nnecessary to overcome difficulties\nwill be undermined, and the student\nwill falter.\nRewarding learning is also true in\nthe day to day sense. When a student is having difficulty with\nwork, he or she is denied the vital\nreward of understanding, which\nmay depress confidence and affect\nother areas of study. It is this close\nidentification of the emotional state\nof confidence with successful\nongoing study, and the converse\nidentification of intellectual defeat\nwith depressive ness and academic\nproblems, which lends such\nurgency to dealing with the\nproblem.\nPage 12\nFelix 949\nDull Boy.\n'eat ure20 November 1992\nWhat If You Are Worried About Your Work?\nStand On Your Head!\nBe pragmatic. If your work habits\ndo not seem effective, change them.\nIf you get distracted working in\nyour room, try the library. If you\nfind it difficult working in the\nevenings, try getting up earlier and\ndo some then. Don't spend hour\nafter hour staring blankly at notes,\ntext book or problem sheets. Break\naway for a short time - have a cup\nof coffee, walk around for a bit,\nstand on your head in the corner if\nit helps - then try again.\nBreak It Up\nBreak down your work into small\ntasks. Put a limit on what you're\ngoing to do, and for how long. A disorganised approach to work may\nhave suited you before, but if the\nevidence is that it is not adequate\nnow, change the way you do things,\nand feel confident that you are\ncapable of changing.\nGo And See A Tutor\nTalk to your personal tutor. If you\nprefer not to do this, make an\nappointment to see your senior\ntutor, who you can see without\ndisloyalty or discourtesy to your\npersonal tutor. On the whole,\nacademic staff are tolerant of a less\nthan perfect performance,\nrecognising that people have\ndifferent levels of competence and\ndifferent rates of getting themselves\ninto their degree course. It is\npossible for you to become worried\nabout your work before it becomes\nobvious to anyone else. The onus\nis on you to initiate discussion about\nit with those best fitted to help you.\nRead Guides To Studying\nBy all means look in libraries and\nbook shops for books on study skills\nand study problems - you may well\nfind something helpful. There is\nalso a very short booklet available\nDon Adlington works on the\nfirst floor of 15 Princes\nGardens. His telephone\nextension is 3041.\nin College called Study Success.

I won't for\nexample, talk to your department\nbehind your back. Your time at\nuniversity is precious. It is also\nfinite and there may be practical\nreasons for talking around work\nanxieties sooner rather than later.\nFor one thing, the relentless flood\nof material coming at you can cause\na feeling of panic. For another\nthing, timing may be critically\nimportant if there is the possibility\nof transferring to another course,\ndepartment or university.\nA Final Word\nNone of the college staff derives\nsatisfaction from students' academic\ndistress. There is a great concern\nthat students who are not working\nwell should be identified early\nenough for real help to be given,\nand the key to that, quite often, is\nthe student's willingness to\nacknowledge the problem.\nThink about it.\nTravelling\nThe Mind!\nCTS TRAVEL...Reduces the Cost!\nNORTH AMERICA\n071-323 5180\nEUROPE\n071-637 5601\nLONG HAUL\n071-323 5130\nATLANTA\nBOSTON\nCHICAGO\nDALLAS\nLOS ANGELES\nMIAMI\nNEW YORK\nORLANDO\nOW/TRN OW/RTN\nInWNMktional StudenVtvHtntity Card\n109 218 AMSTERDAM 37 70 AUCKLAND\n108,218 \"ATHER-BRUSSELS 37 It CARACAS\n133 265\n109 203\n133 265 MILAN\nSAN FRANCISCO 1\n4\n7 294 PA\u00abF^ TORONTO 1\n2\n8 239 ROME\nVANCOUVER 218 349 TEL AVIV\nWASHINGTON V^ M0V2W\\v lENNA: G KOJKS\n65 1\n3\n0 NAIROBI\n'37 n'i so j< \u2122\n99 199 SYDNEY\n13 1\n2\nS OW/RTN\nFROM\n487 789\n235 412\n253 418\n202 398\n210 420\n267 528\n264 485\n206 407\n287 499\n256 450\n408 755\n299 588\nROUND THE WORLD\n\u00a3787\n44 Goodge Street\nLondon W l ti$A De GOOD G!

Dear Felix,\nIt seems to me that whether or not\nIC leaves London University, we\nshould make it clear that the name\nof this institution should not change.\nThere is no advantage to being\ncalled a 'university' mainly due to\nthe fact that most people who read\nabout a new 'Imperial University'\nwill automatically think that we are\nsome sort of jumped up\npolytechnic. No one is fooled by\nestablishments such as the 'New\nUniversity of Mid Wales\nincorporating the allied union of\nsheep bother ers' or whatever.\nEverybody can see that the\npolytechnics are just trying to give\nthemselves some much needed\ncredibility by stealing the\n'prestigious' uni name. I also\nsuggest that those people who think\nthat everyone will recognise that an\nImperial University is just the same\nas Imperial College are mistaken.\nOur reputation will diminish and\nour foreign standing will suffer\nlikewise because no one outside this\ncountry will know what is going on.\nIn short, there are only two\nacceptable alternative names for this\ngreat place. We can stay as Imperial \u2022\nCollege, or we can shorten the\nname (as many people already do\nin conversation) to plain old\nImperial which maintains our\ncredibility but distinguishes us from\nour old London University days.\nYours faithfully,\nMy les WA Davison.\nP.S.

I believe that part of this would be to\nnever think of any of my fellow\nstudents as sad. I am referring to the\nEditorial in Felix 947 where you\nutter your editorial contempt to the\nactivities of the mascot e er. The\ndemise of which I feel is a sad loss\nto the college just as the precious\n9.30am starts which were wiped out\nwith the tyranny that Margaret\nThatcher demolished the NC B. Although I admit to feel it is taken\nfar too seriously by some poeple I think it a pathetic attack of a college\ntradition which still has much to\noffer the student today. Not only\ndoes the mascot help give the\nstudent an identity but also\nsomething worth looking after. As\nto the money aspect I remind the\neditor that ramming shaving foam\nin people's faces is one method\nsponsored by the Union and another\nbeing the 'kidnapping' of people. I refer to the case in the late eighties\nwhen the IC Union president was\nkidnapped during rag and a \u00a3 1 0 0\nransom fee was delivered. The\nreply was that the college would pay\n\u00a3100 for the kidnappers to keep\nhim. Maybe this could happen this\nyear to some hacks, sad or not.\nI understand the concern that can\narise from accidents and the way\nactivities can become addictive and\nsoul consuming. I do feel however\nthat there are many other activities\nthroughout the college that are not\nonly potentially harmful but have a consuming effect on a person's attitude to life. I can refer to\nrowing, rugby, biking,\nconservatism, Rag and many, many\nmore. I would hope that as editor\nyou spend a large proportion of\nyour time thinking and talking\nFelix, but does this mean you\ndeserve our contempt? I would hope\nnot.\nYours,\nThomas Sullivan, RSM.\nP.S.I must say that this letter is\nin reply to your editorial and I must\nadd a big thank you for all your\nhard work to produce a student\nnewspaper we can all be proud of.\nACCOMMODATION\nAVAILABLE\nA selection of small accommodation\nunits to suit married couples or two\npostgraduates sharing is available until\nSeptember 1993\nRents are \u00a3116 per week (inclusive)\nPLEASE CALL IN AT THE\nACCOMMODATION OFFICE\n15 Princes Gardens\nOR TELEPHONE\n071-589 5111 ext 3602/3\nFOR FURTHER DETAILS\nPage 4\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 U LI 1 il Issue94920 November 1992\nCulture shock rumpus in JCR\nby D Spooner and L Yates\nThe Junior Common Room (JCR)\nwas closed early on Wednesday\nafternoon after a disturbance\ninvolving the Turkish, Cypriot and\nHellenic (Greek) Societies.\nThe commotion was apparently\ncaused by a tourist poster displayed\non the Turkish Society stall for\nOverseas Week 1992, and a map\nand tourist material on the same\nstall, which showed Northern\nCyprus as the Turkish Republic Of\nNorthern Cyprus. Northern Cyprus\nhas been a disputed territory since\nit was invaded by Turkey in 1974,\nbut is not recognised by British\nGovernment, or the United Nations.\nWhen a Cypriot Society member\nsaw the poster he complained to\nTurkish Society members manning\nthe stand, and asked them to remove\nthe poster. The Turkish Society\nmembers refused to do so. The\nCypriot Society member then left,\nand returned with other members of\nthe Cypriot and Hellenic Societies,\nincluding executive members of\nboth Societies. The group asked\nagain for the removal of the displays\nwhich they regarded as offensive.\nThe Turkish Society again declined.\nThe crowd then acted in a manner\ndescribed in an ICU written\nstatement as 'aggressive'.\nIndependent witnesses reported\nseeing various objects being thrown\nat the Turkish stand. Rick Bilby,\nICU Deputy President, and\nDominic Wilkinson, ICU Honorary\nSecretary (Events), were called to\nthe JCR, along with executive\nmembers of the Overseas Students'\nCommittee (OSC) and members of\nCollege security.\nThe Greeks and Cypriots were\nthen asked to leave the JCR. They\nrefused, and began singing their\nnational anthems. At this point the\nJCR was cleared, and all stands\nwere shut down. The poster was\nlater judged to contravene ICU\npublicity rules (section 7, paragraph\n4) which state that no material may\nbe displayed which could cause\noffence.\nThe Turkish Society alleges that\nthe previous day (Tuesday) the\nHellenic and Cypriot Societies had\nboth displayed material which could\nbe considered offensive to the\nTurkish community, though it has\nbeen claimed that this material was\nremoved at the request of Turkish\nstudents. The Turkish Society\nfurther claimed that they are\ncontinually oppressed by the Greeks\nand Cypriots, and that the material\non their stand was only being used\nto promote Turkish beliefs and\nculture, the objectives of the\nOverseas Week. They added that\ntheir material had no political\ncontent.\nThe Cypriot and Hellenic\nSocieties, in an interview with\n(CNN, stated that 'Cyprus is an\nindependent state; it has nothing to\ndo with Turkey, or Greece'.\nMembers of these Societies then\nalleged that Rick Bilby had\nthreatened their Societies with\nclosure if they did not leave the\nJCR. Mr. Bilby is a member of the\nICU Disciplinary Committee,\nwhich has the power to refuse\nfunding for any society after a consensus decision. When asked if\nhe was attempting to pre-emp t the\ndecision of the committee, Mr Bilby\nwould neither confirm nor deny the\naccusation and insisted on replying\nvia a printed statement which failed\nto answer our question.\nYen Yang Lim, chairman of the\nOverseas Students' Committee,\nlater declined to comment on the\nincident, and added that (CNN and\nFelix should not publish details of\nthe incident. When pressed further,\nhe condemned the 'anti- social'\nbehaviour of an unnamed group,\nand apologised to those whose\nefforts had been disrupted.\nThe controversial poster shown in the JCR on Wednesday.\nCharter in pipeline\nby D Curry, News Editor\nConservative Central Office sources\nhave confirmed reports that the\nGovernment will publish a 'students' charter' before\nChristmas. Sources have told (CNN\nthat a document, expected to be\ntitled 'The Further and Higher\nEducation Charter', will be printed\nbefore 5th December, the date of\nthe next Whitehall-wide Charter\nmeeting. The Department for\nEducation ( D FE), while not\ndenying the reports, say that an\neducation charter will be published\nby the New Year.\nIt is not expected that voluntary\nmembership will be introduced, in\nthe charter. Senior officers of the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)\nhave consistently claimed that the\ncabinet is split on the issue, with the\nEducation Secretary, John Patten,\nbecoming increasingly isolated. It\nis thought that Mr Patten would\nprefer to implement voluntary\nmembership from his department,\nrather than leave the matter with Mr\nWaldegrave, Charter Minister. Mr\nPatten has already promised to\nmake a separate statement on\nvoluntary membership around\nChristmas, and has also spoken of\npublishing a legislative paper in\nJanuary 1994, apparently blocking\na substantial announcement on\nvoluntary membership in the\ncharter.\nChris Davidson, President of\nImperial College Union (ICU), has\nannounced the full membership of\nthe ICU working party on voluntary\nmembership. In addition to Mr\nDavidson, the committee will\nconsist of Nicky Fox, Rachel\nMountford, Jonty Beavan, Demi\nJones, Rhian Pickton, Hugh Eland,\nOliver Shergold, Boon Yeo; Steve\nFarrant, Sarah Lee, and two\nrepresentatives from the C&GC U.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\n20 November 1992 Felix 949\nSingapura Exotica\nSingapore (our country has just\nbanned chewing gum. Does it ring\nany bells?).\nThere is about 100 of us here,\nfeeling ever so relaxed and laid back about the light workload of the\ncourse at Imperial College. So one\nday, one of us had an idea: why not\nput on a broadway show for all the\nworld to see?\nSo we had this vision, a vision\nsoon to be realised. 'Singapura\nErotica' will be the first ever\nperformance in the history of the\nSingapore Society.\nThe Exotica aims to give the\naudience a brief outline of the\nhistory of Singapore. From a small\nfishing village, Singapore has been\na British colony, and a fallen land(?)\nduring the Second World War,\nbefore becoming the modern and\nvibrant city of today. Since\nindependence in 1965, Singapore\nhas come a long way in just 27\nyears from a small island with just\n2 million people and no natural\nresources.\nCertainly, Singapore does not\npossess a history as ancient as China\nor a tradition as old as Britain.\nHowever, it is a society made up of\nimmigrants who came from all over\nthe world many years ago. The\nvarious ethnic groups brought with\nthem their culture and way of life.\nOver the decades saw the blending\nto give a unique character. The\nnation today boasts of a people of\nall races and religions living in\nharmony.\nWith this central theme, the\nExotica presents the story of\nSingapore via multi-media. The\naudience will be treated to a humorous cross-talk, a fine-tuned\nprecision drill, plus sketches,\ndances and songs. A fine selection\nof slides on scenes of old and\nmodern Singapore, together with\nsnippets of video clips, will also be\nshown.\nOn top of that, there is also going\nto be a guest performance by the\nInternational Shaolin Kungfu\nFrederation and the Tiger Clan\nCombination Organisation. They\nwill be giving a dynamic lion dance\nand a stunning display of Chinese\nmartial arts.\nIt must be stressed that a tremendous amount of time and\neffort has gone into putting on this\nproduction. Preparation started as\nearly as May this year and during\nthese few months, nothing has been\nspared in order to present the\naudience with the best\nentertainment, complete with visual\nand audio effects, authentically\ntailored costumes air-flown from\nSingapore, and fabulous sets and\nprops.\nSo, why don't you come?\nSingapura Exotica\nSaturday 28th Nov 1992\n8.00pm The Great Hall\n\u00a34\nTickets are available from any\nSingapore Soceity member and the\nStudents' Union Office.\nFilmSoc - Point Break\nLadies Rugby\nThis week, FilmSoc is delighted to\nbe showing perhaps one of the most\naction-packed films of the year,\nPoint Break.\nKeanau Reeves plays a hot shot\nFBI agent assigned to the 'Old\nPresidents' bank robbers case.\nWearing rubber masks of Nixon,\nCarter etc (hence their name) this\nslick and organised group of thieves\nhave successfully robbed several\nbanks and have so fare completely\noutwitted the police. However a vital clue discovered by Reeves'\npartner leads the FBI to suspect a group of surfers. Enter Patrick\nSwayze and friends, a wild group\nlooking for the ultimate adrenal in rush. Reeves befriends the group,\nlearning to surf in the process, and\ntakes part in ever more dangerous\n'stunts' including some breathtaking sky diving scenes.\nThis film has a lot more to it than\njust exciting visual scenes, as the\ndangerous cat and mouse games\nbetween Reeves and Swayze belies\ntheir true identities. So for a great\nevening's entertainment, and a film\nwith more stunts in it than a film\nwith a lot of stunts, come along to\nMech Eng 220 at 7.30pm on\nThursday 26th November. Entry\nfor non members is \u00a31.90, and only\n90p for members. If you haven't joined yet, \u00a36.50 allows you to\nenter the film for free. We look\nforward to seeing you.\nYes, it's happened, and it hasn't happened in a small way. The\nLadies Rugby Team is back with\nveng ance and growing bigger by the\nday. The men thought they had the\nmonopoly on this fabulous sport\u2014\nthe drinking, the rolling around in\nthe mud, the grabbing of each\nother's private parts and most\nimportantly the team baths. Well\nperhaps we won't to participate in\nall these pass times but we will\ncertainly give the beer drinking a go. If you are interested in playing\nfor us or even just coming out for\nsome fun: the practices are\nThursday lunchtimes\n12.30-1.45pm, meet at 12.30 in the\nUnion foyer or join us in Hyde Park\n(next to the tennis courts at 1pm), or Sunday mornings 1 lam\u2014meet in\nBeit Quad. We generally go for a drink in Southside after Sunday\ntraining so if you don't manage to\nmake it to the practice join us there\nfor a chat. We're hot big, we are\nnot all rough we are just normal\npeople like you and none of us have\never played before either! Hope to\nsee you soon. If you have any\nquestions contact Gina Mortley\nMRE2 or Samantha Cox c/o Felix.\nWine tasting, The Sequel\nWine tasting revisited\u2014for those of\nyou who have yet to try the delights\nof this society we present a brief\nresume of the past few week's tasting s to whet your appetite for the\nevents still to happen this term and\nnext.\nBut first this...IMPORTANT\nANNOUNCEMENT: Wine Rack\nof Knightsbridge are generously\noffering a10% discount on all\npurchases, on production of your\nWine Tasting Society membership\ncard. And, of course with your\nmembership card, you're still\nentitled to a \u00a31 discount on all\nTuesday tasting s( membership is \u00a37\nfor the year and an average tasting\ncosts \u00a3 4 for non-members).\nSo, what have you missed already\nthis term?\n27th October.

Well, actually no, but Falerno\nis made from the same grape variety\nthe Ancient Romans used (or as\nnear as can be cultivated). A spicy\nred, at \u00a38.99 it's little more than a curiosity, the general consensus was\nthat the Roman Empire was\nwelcome to it!\n3rd November.

Best Red\u2014Rowan Cabertnet\nSauvignon, Aus., Rowan 1986\n\u00a36.99. The battle ended as a draw\nwith the characteristic Australian as\na full fruited, up-front wine, whilst\nthe French relied on a complexity\nand subtlety of flavours. Both types\nwere recognised for being very\ndifferent wines but it must be said\nthat the Australians tended to come\nout on top!\nComing up\u201424th November\u2014\nBeaujolais, 1st December\u2014Blind\nTasting (with prizes for the best\ntaster/guesser), 8th December\u2014Port.\nRemember, meetings are\nTuesday 6pm in the Union Lounge,\nall are welcome and with\nmembership cards you can not only\nget discount tasting s but also get\n10% from Wine Rack in\nKnightsbridge.

One of a capacity 600\ncrowd, I get the feeling I'm not the\nonly one who is becoming slight y impartial to this lot. At least they\ngive me a chance to write my\nshopping list. They seem to want to\nbelong to a scene with Natural Life,\nor East 17, that kind of ballpark. As\nthe set progresses, at least I can see\nthe band. Maybe some people are\nleaving. Maybe there are six of\nthem on stage.\nLise Yates\nAirstream-ULU 12.11.92\n'kin ace.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 'Crush', out now on One Little\nIndian.\nStrollercoaster\u2014The\nCamden Underworld\n7.11.92\nWhat is it with Australia? Is\noriginality a dirty word? Why do\nthey feel they have to copy\nsomebody else to be noticed? Using\nthe inside of your trousers to keep\nyou mic is just disgusting.\nThe first of the real acts, in this\nbohemian decadence that is the\nStrollercoaster tour, are The\nCuckoos. John Fat Beast introduces\nthem, saying they're his favourite.\nI'm not arguing with his decision\nbut personally the half an hour they\nplayed for has left absolutely no\nlasting impression.\nThe Hinnes, tonight's next\noffering could never be accused of\nleaving no impression. But being\nvery loud and brash is not art. And\nit's definitely not enjoyable.\nThe next act, if such a word is\nZodiac Mindwarp\u2014My Life\nStory\nA first glance of the listed tracks,\nthe innocuously titled T Love You'\nsounds almost sadistic amongst\n'Raw and Bleeding', 'Slutfreak' and\nsuch like, but is one of the slower\n'heart-warming' tracks.\nThe rest of it is basically\nsubversive gothic thrash with tits of\nblues-rock, which sounds like the\nPsychedelic Furs, White Zombie\nand the Rolling Stones cross-bred.\nThe back cover sports a checklist\nof an obscene array of drugs\n(complete with ticks), such as\nketamine, man dra x, PCP etc (more\ncommon stuff also there)\nreinforcing the mind warp bit.\n'Holy Gasoline': unrepentant\nblasphemers or just a great song\n(the latter suits me find). The title\ntrack 'My Life Story' contains a lot\nof neglected anguish...(sorry,\nalmost another opportunity to\nbombard you with pretentious\nbullshit). But I have to say there are\nsubtle undercurrents of malign ance and possibly cold turkey throughout\nthis mini-LP.\nNot bad considering it was\nknocked up in ten days or so\u2014\nwhenever you're feeling down, but\nangry, this is the biz. Pure\nunrestrained sleaze\u2014brilliant.\nLucas.\n\u2022 Out now on Musidisc.\nappropriate, is Genius Freak. A lone figure fills the stage. He rocks,\nhe pouts, he generally makes a complete fool of himself.\nI detest bands that have names I can't pronounce. And what happens\nif I happen to like them? 'They were\ngreat, but I can't for the life of me\ntell you who they were.' A bit silly\nreally. A bit of a shame. What an\nabsolutely, enchanting voice. On\nthe showing tonight, which is\nnothing special particularly for a last night, they stand heads and\nshoulders above the rest.\nThere were strong rumours that\nLevitation were going to be 'extra\nspecial guests'. If they were I missed them. My dinner decided to\ndo a boomerang so after ten minutes\nof mighty stomach exercise I left.\nI sort of hope they didn't turn up,\nit would make me feel a little better.\nPeb\nAnna Palm \u2014Love Me\nLove me indeed. The voice and\nviolin of Anna Palm drift\neffortlessly, almost helplessly from\nanother plane with the immediate\nsimplistic splendour of 'Don't Know', the highlight in my book.\nFor solitary listening, through\ndinner parties, to wherever else you\nso desire, the beauty of this album\nis a perfect accompaniment and it\nonly left my record deck when I was\nforced at gunpoint to listen to\nsomething else.\nLise Yates.\n\u2022 Out now on One Little Indian.\nIf you want to hear some Anna\nPalm, tune into the Chidren in Need\nbenefit on GL R tonight, 7.30pm(94.9 FM). Prince and the New Power\nGeneration \u2014 Love Symbol\nPrince can hardly be accused of\nresting on his Paisley patterned\nlaurels as barely a year since\n'Diamonds and Pearls' he delivers\nanother 16 tracks running to 75\nminutes, issued under an enigmatic\ngold symbol. The single gave us\nadvance warning of what to expect;\n'My name is Prince\u2014and I am\nfunky...' and so the album appears\nto pick up where the last one left\noff. In fact the funk becomes quite\nrelentless, reminiscent of the\nunreleased but widely circulated\nBlack Album. It moves into James\nBrown territory with 'Sexy M.F.'( yes, this does go some way to\nexplain the 'beware, indelicate\nlanguage' sticker on the CD case),\nand makes several attempts at rap,\nwhich is one area at least that\n'Pearls' and 'Blue Light' offer some\nmelodic relief, the latter being a not\ntotally convincing reggae exercise.\nAlbums\nMoonshake, Eva Luna\nAvant-garde experiment a lists, they\nhave taken My Bloody Valentine's sound to a point where even Kevin\nShields couldn't of imagined it was\npossible to take it. So much so that\nthis record does little to resemble\ntheir MB V inspired first and only\nCreation EP.\nRasping dub-basslines, crashing\nguitars, balearic break-beats,\nridiculous samples fuse together to\nform a sound of rare originality, but\na sound of often quite menacing\nproportions. It is the perfect backdrop for the acid-bathed\nobservations of Margaret Fiedler\nand David Callagan who share the\nsong-writing in Moonshake. It's not\nwhat one would call a cosy\nrelationship, more , an\nuncomfortable fusion of two\nseriously distorted minds. The most\nfrightening aspect is that their\nobservations are uncannily acute\nand accurate. This record is a social-commentary of inner city\ngloom fuelled by vitriol and\ncynicism towards a socially inept\npolitical system; a society based on\napathy heading on a path of self-destruction. From the\nglamour is ation of serial-killers,\nunwanted pregnancy, the homeless.\nMoonshake are not afraid to deal\nwith issues that the populace find\nuncomfortable. These aren't the\nfashionable fears that Callagan sings\nabout in 'City Poison'. Moonshake\ncare about the issues they sing\nabout.\nLeo.\nOut now on Too Pure.\nMost of the tracks cover the familiar\nterritory of sex and yet more sex,\nbut with less of the devotional\nmaterial this time. 'The\nContinental' gives a graphic\ndescription of what a woman\nexpects from Prince by way of a physical performance\nAnd at this point the character of\nthe album changes. Prince regains\nhis pop sensibilities and we are\ntreated to a rare mixture of styles,\nincluding '3 Chains o 'Gold', a rock\nopera/pomp rock confection that\nwould have left Queen open\nmouthed. So what is the sum of the\nvarious parts? It's hard to say when\ndealing with such quantity, but\nprogram your CD player and you\ncould have two distinct albums here\nand both pretty fine representatives\nof their respective genres.\nAdrian.\n\u2022 Out now on Warner/Paisley\nPark.\nToo Much Apple Pie: Where is No. II?

    "content": "Reviews\nFelix 949 20 November 1992\nBook^, Cannibalism: The Last Taboo\nby Brian Marriner\nThis book is not for the feeble\nminded or those with a weak\nstomach. It describes all the known\nincidents of cannibalism, from those\nthat ate through tradition, those that\nate through necessity, those that ate\nfor profit and those that ate for the\nsheer perverse enjoyment.\nThe book is very easy to swallow\nand can give anyone ideas. After\nall, it does state that all the people\nwho have eaten human flesh found\nthe taste was of a quality close to\nany other meat that they had eaten.\nIt also linked modern cannibalism\nwith sexual perversion; we all\nremember the case of Jeffery\nDahmer - the homosexual man eater\nfrom Wisconsin only in 1990.\nSo cannibalism is dead ? Read this\nbook; it's not dead and neither were\nhalf the people that were eaten. It\neven made me start to wonder what\nhalf my friends taste of - oh, and\nthat's an open invitation to dinner...\nS&M \u2022 Published by Arrow, price\n\u00a34.99\nThe Colour of Magic\n(Graphic Novel) - Terry\nPratchett\nAnkh-Morpork is probably the most\ndangerous, crime-infested, bad-natured, dirty, poor city on the\nDiscworld that you could ever hope\nto avoid. Quite why Two flower\ncomes from the other side of the\nDisc to visit, no one knows. In fact\nhe is the only tourist Ankh-Morpork\nhas ever had. The fact that he has\na trunk full of gold (which follows\nhim around where ever he goes on\nhundreds of little legs, and has the\ntemperament of a rabid r ottweiler), makes him fairly popular and leads\nto all kind of trouble.\nHow Rincewind, a fairly useless\nwizard (seeing how he only knows\none spell and he learnt that by\naccident) but a brilliant coward,\nends up guiding Twoflower through\nthe city, trying to save his life on\nnumerous occasions, you must read\nthe book to discover.\nThe story itself is superb, as is the\nartwork and humour of Terry\nPratchett. The only problem was\nthat having read the paperback, I thought Rincewind would have\nlooked a lot scruffier, with a more\nhopeless sense of fashion, than he\ndid in this comic version. However,\nthe comic version also meant that\nall the little subplots (or waffle, as\nother people see it) was missed out,\nso you could follow the story quite\nwell.\nIf you like graphic novels and Terry\nPratchett's sense of wit then this is\na must for your collection.\nGB H \u2022 Published by Corgi, price \u00a36.99\nThe Myth-ing Ombibus by\nRobert Asprin\nBoth Myth-ing Omnibus books are\ndescribed as 'seriously funny' with\na varied cast and I cannot have put\nit better myself.\nEach book, a combination of\nthree separate books, follows on\nperfectly from the previous and they\nall describe a different adventure of\nSkeeve, a teenage apprentice\nmagician masquerading as a real\nmagician. Skeeve frequently winds\nup in life-threatening situations and\nwith the help of Aahz; a demon,\nGleep; his loyal dragon and the\nsexually-teasing Tananda, he not\nonly escapes from each disaster but\nhe always makes a tidy profit. The\nbooks also follow the growing\nrelationship of Aahz and Skeeve as\nhe encounters a few of life's problems, like dealing with\nvampires and how to run from a lynch mob.\nThe humour is deeply sarcastic\nand sometimes very silly with our\n'hero' nearly always at the centre\nof it. The funniest situation is when\nSkeeve has to convince an angry\nmob that he really is dying on the\ngallows and he describes quite\nmodestly his acting performance.\nThe only part of the books I hated\nwas the damn American spelling of\nwords like colour. Call me picky,\nbut I think that any book designed\nfor an English reader should be\ntranslated from American into\nEnglish.\n\u00a38.99 for each book might sound\npricey but it is definitely worth it\nfor six of the most whimsical books\navailable.\nP.J. Dodd\n\u2022 Published by Legend, price\n\u00a38.99\n500 Tips for Students by\nPhil Race\nStudent days may be the best of\nyour lives but that doesn't mean that\nthey are the easiest. All to often\npeople come to college with dreams\nand ambitions, and after only a couple of months they fade and die\nas their chosen subject dominates\nand rejects them, so how do you\nconquer your course and still be an\ninteresting person with time to do\nsome fun things .\nWell you could do a lot worse\nthan follow the advice of \" 500 Tips\nFor Students\". A light tome with\ninvaluable advice on how to\nmaintain your energy and\nenthusiasm whilst studying. Laid\nout in 51 sections, covering topics\nfrom \"Time Management \" to\n\"Improving Your Memory \" the\nbook, at first sight, appears to be\na massive collection of common\nsense that everyone is obviously\naware of.\nSo why buy it ? Common sense\nis something that almost everybody\nlacks. This is especially true of\npeople in the top 2% bracket of\nintelligence; yes, those of us at\ncollege. Even if you prize yourself\non being pretty good at working\nthings out and at using your time\nquite well, this book will back you\nup. It will get you off to a good\nstart. It will keep you going until the\nvery end by getting you to recognise\nyour goals in life.\nAlong the lines of several other\nmotivational-common sense\nproducts such as \"How To Win\nFriends and Influence People \" and\n\"The Magic of Thinking Big \" ,\n\"500 Tips Foe Students \" opens\nyour eyes to your true potential. In\nsimple terms it presents obvious\nfacts about learning and getting on\nwith things. Despite its easy to read\nstyle, it still manages to excite and\nshould be kept near at all times\nwhile at college. That extra boost\nfrom a few lines of text could mean\nthe difference between a pass and\na fail, or a1 st or 2nd class degree.\nRead this book and knock them\ndead.\nAlkatraz.\n\u2022 Published by Blackwell\nPublishers, price \u00a34.99\nPage 19\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nManning the Martello Towers\nDear Editor,\nI was delighted to see several\nmentions of the Queen's English\nSociety in Felix 948. The writer of\nBeit Back, however, appears to\nknow very little about the QES or\nits aims. Far from being a body of\nmen, we have many female\nmembers, including our chairman.\nWe have never claimed to be an\nintellectual elite; our members\ninclude manual workers as well as\nprofessionally-qualified people. The\nBeiter's comment about black\nAmericans not counting was in poor\ntaste. Our members include 'blacks'\nand 'whites', Britons, Germans,\nAmericans, Sri Lankans,\nAustralians, etc. The Society's name, on which Beiter appears to\nbase most of his or her conclusions,\nis part of a Shakespearean\nquotation.\nThe massive publicity to which\nyour correspondent refers did not\ncome from naive statements\nlamenting the standards of grammar\nin our universities; they would be\nof little interest to the media, which\nprefer facts. The publicity came\nmainly from my 64-page book, ' A National Survey of UK Undergraduates' Standards of\nEnglish', published by the QES at\n\u00a33.00, available from the College\nBookstore and from me.\nThis book was based on a scientific survey of 17 UK universities or colleges, with a51.5% return of 336 questionnaires,\nCredits - News; Declan, Poddy,\nDavid Spooner, Dave Goddard,\nGareth, Sang, Tanya, MiMi Features; Beccy, Don Adlington,\nTatiana Lopes, Simon Su, Spoons,\nReviews; Catherine, Sara, Mario,\nRob, Tina, Gareth, Sam, Poddy,\nWhats On;James, Poddy, Sport;\nJonathan, Sarmud Special Thanks;\nSarah H, Easan, David Spooner,\nBroadsheet, Rose, Andy, Chris,\nRick, Dom, James Crisp, John\nWestwater, Ian Hodge, Steve\nNewhouse, Hugh Eland and David\nSpooner for last week, Phil.\nSmall Ads\n\u2022 \u00a330 REWARD for in form tion leading to the the return (no\nquestions asked) of my much\nmissed brown suede jacket, which\nwas lost in Da Vinci's late on\nFriday 6th November.

Are\nyou interested in joining a piss-up\nclub vaguely along the same lines\nwith answers from 148\ndepartments, and a detailed study of\none department to assess the range\nof staff opinions on the same group\nof students. Far from being\nconfined to grammar, the study\nincluded spelling, punctuation,\nhandwriting, vocabulary, and\nclarity of written and spoken\nexpression. As well as containing\na mass of data which the press\nobviously found interesting, the\nbook quotes extensively from\ncomments made by those returning\nthe questionnaires, whether I agreed\nwith their comments or not. The\nstudy provided firm evidence on\nwhich to base discussions as to what\nshould or should not be done about\nEnglish teaching in schools and\nuniversities.\nMy article in the summer edition\nof Felix was written at the editor's request, and included reasons why\ngood English is helpful to students\nand why bad English can be\nharmful. There were examples of\nfaults to be aware of, and how to\navoid them. The staff member who\nspotted 'Youthenasia' in a student's essay certainly did not think it was\na pun; it has given pleasure to many\npeople, but I would caution against\nusing anything which might be\nmisinterpreted as ignorance in\nformal essays.\nWe have never said that English\nshould conform to 'a standardized\nand rigorous formula'.

For example, my\nstories In a Cavern (Phoenix 1984)\nand The Wheels of Fate (Phoenix\n1976) are both in 'uneducated\nAmerican' dialects. Like many of\nour members, I enjoy regional\naccents and dialects. They are fine\nfor local purposes, but for general\ncommunication nationally and\ninternationally, a single general\nform of a language is best\nunderstood and usable by all. It\nwould be absurd and dangerous if\na foreign airline pilot had to cope\nwith an incomprehensible (to\noutsiders) local dialect when being\n'talked down' at our airports. A single standard form is best, which\nfor us, for historical reasons, is\nStandard English with Received\nPronunciation. Beiter is quite wrong\nto assume that we want everyone to\nuse these all the time.\nAccording to our policy\ndocument, the main aims of The\nQueen's English Society are: to\nencourage high standards of\neducation in English in the United\nKingdom; to promote literacy, and\nknowledge, understanding and\nappreciation of our rich language;\nto monitor and to try to improve the\nstandards of English used in the\npublic media; to discourage\nslovenly usage and the intrusion of\nanything detrimental to clarity or\neuphony.

    "content": "'eat ure20 November1992 Felix949 Ecstasy - The Fashion Drug\nTatiana Viera Lopes examines the ignorance and the passion behind Britain's latest drug craze, following a talk given by Dr John Henry from Guy's Hospital.\nA lot has been said about drug\nabuse. Has it been enough, though?\nConsidering the amount of drugs\ngoing around, I think not.\nOn Tuesday 3rd November, the\nScience and Ethics Society invited\nDr John Henry from the Poisons\nDepartment of Guy's Hospital to\ntalk about it. He has great\nexperience in dealing with cases of\ndrug abuse and is very aware of its\neffects.\nWe could be\ndealing with\nsubstances that\nare going to\nchange the\nimage of a whole\ngeneration.\nThe talk covered all sorts of drugs\nfrom alcohol and tobacco to heroin\nand ecstasy. Some of the scientific\nfacts were mentioned: how\naddictive each drug is, how does it\nbecome addictive, what are the\nwithdrawal symptoms etc., but the\nreally interesting parts were the\nstories he told us about his personal\nexperiences when dealing with\nthese cases.\nThe talk was not conveyed\nthrough a puritan point of view; he\ndidn't tell us what we already knew.\nWe all know that drugs are\ndangerous, we all know that drugs\nare bad. The real problem is what\nwe don't know about them, and it\nis in this field that research, through\nclinical history studies, is most\nneeded.\nThe members of our generation\nwho are drug consumers and who'll\nsurvive this consumption will most\ncertainly suffer future medical\nconsequences, but it is not known\nwhat these will be. We could be\ndealing with substances that are\ngoing to change the image of a whole generation, just like acid\n(LSD) did in the 60s. Today, it isn't LSD which is in.\nIt's ecstasy. Ecstasy is becoming\npart of a teenagers' culture.\nObviously it is not everywhere!\nIt's not the sort of pill you take\nbefore a lecture in order to wake\nAsk anyone and\nthey '11 tell you\nhorrible stories\nof what\nhappened to\npeople on E. you up and put you in a good mood\n(we all wish those existed, but they\ndon't) but in any club you'll always\nfind someone who has it for sale and\nmany on it already.\nIt's the fashion drug. Ecstasy by\nitself is already an exciting word.\nSongs speak about it, you use it to\nexpress energetic excitement on the\ndance floor and it is not addictive,\nto some people it is cool to take E as it makes you get in the mood to\nrave.\nAny hard-core rave r will know\nwhat I'm talking about. It releases\nyour libido and makes you feel\nbrave.\nThe problem with ecstasy is that\nnothing is known about it. Ask\nanyone and they'll tell you horrible\nstories of what has happened to\npeople on E( like you used to hear\nabout LSD), but there are very few\nmedical records which could\nprovide a scientific base for\nconclusions.

After weeks\nof secrecy and careful planning, the\nHalls Dirty Dozen competition was\nupon us. This was the event where\nyou decided what you wanted to do\nand we just helped you along. And\ndid you come up with some crazy\nideas? We had teams dancing in the\nstreets, St Trinian's running\naround, slaves on the loose, teams\nin London, Colchester, Guildford\nand Little Hampton and everybody\n'doing it' for charity.\nThe results of the day were\nhappily surprising with \u00a34,033.43\nbeing raised for various charities.\nThe top team and winners of the\nbarrel of beer were Falmouth\nKeogh who managed to raise a staggering sum of \u00a31419.25 for\nCystic Fibrosis.\nFor those of you with more than\na passing interest in this article I record here for posterity a brief\nsummary of the events of the day\nfrom the point of view of each team.\n1st Falmouth Keogh\nIn search of a healthier environment\nour team pushed off to Guildford to\ndo a spot of collecting for Cystic\nFibrosis. Our six hours licensed\ncollecting time was well used,\ndespite attempts by the incessant\nrain to dampen our spirits and we\nmanaged to collect about \u00a31400.\n2nd Southwell\nWe thought it would be ingenious\nto go out collecting in drag and ask\npeople for money in exchange for\nsexual favours. Yes, that's right,\nwe're the team who went out as St\nTrinians. We stopped for a Burger\nKing meal (with no onions and extra\nketchup, thankyou very much) and\n\u2022met Anthony Hopkins along the\nway. Final total: an amazing\n\u00a3574.33 for Amnesty International.\n3rd Fisher\nHaving finally decided to go to\nLittle Hampton, Arundel and\nRushton to collect for BIBIC, we\ngot to see a castle and wander\naround some very nice old\nfashioned towns in the rain. The\nnews that we had collected \u00a3514.93\nwas very welcome, when we\nreturned home cold and soggy.\n4th Garden\nOur Dirty Dozen was slightly\ndepleted due fo a sore toothy-peg\n(a ahh h). Not to be deterred, the rest\nof us braved various tetanus\ninfections as we stumbled round\nLondon chained up like slaves,\nharassing tourists into coughing up\nfor Amnesty International. At the\nend of the day, we handed over the\nmagnificent sum of \u00a3422.10.\n5th Tizard, Linstead, Selkirk\nA joint team, because each of our\nhall's individual teams were sadly\nlacking in numbers. We hit\nColchester to try our luck in\ncollecting for WAIFS, an animal\nwelfare charity. Despite harsh\nwintry conditions, our combined\nteam of only nine people still\nmanaged to collect \u00a3411.\n6th Weeks\nThe Halls Dirty Half Dozen, more\nlike, from us. Not that we didn't prove our worth, though. Silly ideas\nabounded, namely playing Twister\noutside Buckingham Palace and\ndoing John Cleese style silly walks\nround Eros. We also raided all the\nother rival halls and collected there\ntoo! Total sum: \u00a3 2 9 8 . 3 1 to\nAmnesty.7 th Willis Jackson\nOK, so we didn't raise a fortune,\nbut we raised a few laughs and\nHalls competition\nWillis Jackson \u00a317.08\nFalmouth Keogh \u00a313.05\nGarden \u00a312.44\nLinstead \u00a310.70\nWeeks \u00a38.80\nFisher \u00a38.08\nTizard \u00a36.92\nSouthwell \u00a36.89\nSelkirk \u00a33.22\nBernard Sunley \u00a32.34\nthat's got to be worth something.\nWe did party dances around\nLondon which included the\nLocomotion in Leicester Square,\nThe Can-Can in Carnaby Street,\nand the Hokey Kokey in Piccadilly\nCircus. In between dances, we still\nmanaged to raise \u00a3254.42 for\nAmnesty.\n8th Bernard Sunley\nWe started at Covent Garden and\non the way there lost two collectors.\nThe mystery deepened with the\ngradual loss of four more collectors\nnear Neal Street and we alone\nsurvived to tell this harrowing tale\nof cold, sleet, snow, massive tidal\nBoingM!\nwaves, volcanoes, prehistoric\nbeasts and, of course, mad\ndepraved collector-hunters. PS. We\nraised \u00a3140.11!\nSo well done to all you wonderful\npeople - Bruce McKee was the top\ncollector managing to separate \u00a3192\nfrom their owners and the wackiest\nexploits of the event were decided\nto be the party dances round\nLondon by Willis Jackson. Due to\nboth the success and overwhelming\nresponse to this, the first annual\nHalls Dirty Dozen competition, we\nare planning to hold another one\n(The Return!) at the end of next\nterm so get scheming.\nThis weekend will see a group of\nover thirty Raggies taking their life\ninto their hands for UNICEF. Yes,\nonce again RAG are risking life and\nlimb and doing sponsored bungee\njumping. An experience compared\nby many people to sex, involving\na low level, elastically retarded\nfree fall almost two hundred feet\nfrom a crane in central London.\nYou need to be certifiable to do one\nbut you'd be crazy not to.\nOur team of leapers will be\njumping at London's first\npermanent bungee jump site in\nPutney on Saturday morning (tube\nto Putney Bridge, cross river, jump\nsite on left). If you fancy coming\nalong and giving us a bit of support,\nmoral or otherwise please come and\njoin us. We will be meeting at\ncollege at 11.00am and we start\njumping at midday. We have people\njumping in fancy dress, wheelchairs\n(honest g uv!) and one brave person\nintends to jump in the nude.\nPromises to be a great day out for\nall the family!\nBe Mad! Be Silly!\nBe Part Of It!\nPage 7\n\n"
