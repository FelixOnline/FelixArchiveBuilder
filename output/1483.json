Entrance to the race includes a FREE HOT\nMEAL and access to the not-to-be-missed AFTER\nPARTY!\nThe race follows an historic route through Hyde\nPark and Kensington Gardens, winds around the\nSerpentine lake, down to Hyde Park Corner, and finally finishes up at the band-stand.\nInter-club competition is heating up with alcoholic\nprizes on offer for the fastest non-Cross Country\nand Athletics club teams.\nIt is sure to be a great day and a memorable (or\nperhaps not so memorable if you get on it) night,\nwhich will be hosted at the newly refurbished METRIC NIGHT CLUB for the very first time!!\nEnter your team online now, for as little as \u00a34 per\nperson, to make sure you don\u2019t miss out on this\nfantastic deal.\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/acc/crosscountry/hpr\nDaniel Beatrup\n\u201cThe main part of their\nact was to perform\ntraditional Cypriot\ndances, with live music\u201d\nInternational Night\nAnd the winner is... Cypriot Society!\nMaria Vafeades\nLast Friday, 11th of February at 7:00 p.m, the\nGreat Hall of Sherfield Building was packed\nfrom Imperial College students, friends, parents and staff. The reason? One of the most\nentertaining and full of fun event that is organized annually by the Imperial College Overseas Societies Committee; the International\nNight 2011!\nOSC was very proud to welcome for the very\nfirst time four Guest Judges who were responsible for choosing the best performing group;\nFleur Estelle \u2013 International Dancer who has\nbeen a guest judge on Strictly Come Dancing\nas well, OSC Senior Treasurer Professor David\nStuckey, the ICU President Alex Kendall and\nthe ICSMSU President David Smith.\nChristina Kontoghiorghe, the I-Night Chair,\nwas very satisfied from that amazing night and\nshe said with pride that they started organising\nthe event in July last year having great expectations for that night, which were finally met!\nThis year we had 16 acts and 190 performers\nin total.\nEach society presented a characteristic act\naccording to its culture, its favourite habits and\nhobbies. For more than 3 hours, the audience\nwas supportive of all of the participants and\nthe atmosphere was very warm and friendly,\nsomething that shows that people in Imperial College are not only good at Maths, but\nthey also respect the diversity of cultures and\nrecognize the equality of people all over the\nworld.\nHowever, some acts had greater impact on\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nthe audience than others, for example, after the\nperformance of the last year\u2019s winners, the Japanese Society, Alex Kendall said with a sense\nof humour that \u201che was now confused about his\nsexuality\u201d!\nAlthough the first decision of the judges was\nto elect the Techtonics society, they quickly\nchanged their minds because no representative\nwas there at that moment and they decided to\ngive the prize to the most popular society of\nthat night, the Cypriot Society. Greeks and Cypriots were very excited about this, as you can\nimagine.\nThe President of the Cypriot Society, Constantinos Christou, said that \u201cThe secret of our\nsuccess this year was that during the rehearsals\nand the performance we were having a lot of\nfun and we were enjoying ourselves. We were a\nbatch of 13 friends having a traditional Cypriot\nparty.\u201d\nAlthough, the Cypriot Society presents a\npretty much similar program every year, this\nyear they had some innovations that entertained the audience. The main part of their act\nwas to perform traditional Cypriot dances, but\ninstead of using playbacks, they chose to play\nlive music (guitar and violin) and sing live. The\nwhole scenario took place in a typical coffee\nshop, where people could enjoy a glass of ziva-nia or koumantaria and a game of cards.\nOne of the most risky dancers of the show,\nFaethon Milikouris, performed the traditional\nand very demanding dance of tatsia, in which\nhe used a tray with a glass of koumantaria in it\nand he spun it all the way around in all direc-tions, leaving everyone there speechless. He\nconfessed that he was really nervous for this\nparticular point of his performance because he\ncouldn\u2019t make any mistakes in order to keep\neveryone safe. But he finally managed to make\nit and impress the judges, showing his exper-tise!\nI believe that the detail that distinguishes the\nCypriot team from the others is that it was the\nmost interactive and pioneering team, as they\noffered the audience Cypriot traditional food\nsampling (halloumi cheese and lountza) and\ndrinks, showing the Cypriot hospitality.\nConstantinos, who was playing the violin\nas well, believes that \u201cEveryone in the group\nwas dedicated and well organised, something\nthat was highly appreciated by the judges.\u201d He\nseemed very proud about the result and at the\nend of the show he thanked everyone who supported him and the Cypriot Society.\nAt the end of the show, I heard some people\nmurmuring that this was definitely a Cypriot\nnight and I think they were right as in addition\nto taking the iNight prize, the winner of the\nraffle, Maria Zapiti was Cypriot, too! (note that\na prize was a return ticket to Cyprus..!)\nWell done guys!\nWhile everyone else was watching the acts, the Cypriots sat in the corner drinking and gambling. They were the lucky ones...\nARTFEST\nAll Week:\nBusking in the Business School Foyer and in Sherfield\nMonday:\nSinfonietta perform in the Business School Foyer\n@ 6pm\nArtiFact (RCA-Imperial Speed Dating) in the Union\nConcert Hall @ 6pm \u2013 email artifact@imperial.ac.uk\nfor info and to register\nTuesday:\nNew PhotoSoc and LeoSoc exhibition \u2018Un-tethered\u2019\nunveiled in the Blyth Gallery \u2013 meet the artists, mingle and enjoy posh refreshments!\nWednesday:\nFree workshops in Huxley 344 \u2013 2pm Belly Dancing (girls only), 3pm Drama, 4pm A Capella Singing.\nCome to one or all!\nFlashmob barn dance \u2013 evening, location TBC (see\nARTSFEST on Facebook)\nThursday:\nThe incredible Onyx Brass @ 1pm, Business School\nFoyer\nROCKFEST @ Metric with Jazz & Rock and Musictech Live\nFriday:\nOpen Piano Recital @ 12.15pm, Read Theatre,\nSherfield Level 5 \u2013 boogie-woogie to Rachmaninov\non a Steinway, in 4-minute bites\nThe ARTSFEST Finale 2011 in the Great Hall @\n8pm \u2013 unmissable.

    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX\n10 Friday 18 february 2011\nthe spending of the last decade \u2013 a period\nwhich now by comparison seems like a golden\nage. At the same time, publishing companies\ncontinue to make large profits. From 2005-2009 Elsevier\u2019s profits increased from around\n\u00a31 billion to \u00a31.6 billion. Libraries have been\nlocked into so-called \u201cbig deals\u201d with these\npublishers. Their 3-year subscription deals\noffer their researchers instant access to thousands of journals but have tied libraries into\n6% price increases year-on-year.\nThe pressure for libraries to reduce costs\nhas become irresistible \u2013 \u201cthe fact is that we\ndon\u2019t have money in the sector and we can\u2019t\nafford to go on spending as we have,\u201d says\nDeborah. With journal subscriptions taking\nup a significant chunk of library spending \u2013\nImperial spends \u00a33.8 million each year on\njournal subscriptions (out of a total library\nbudget of \u00a38.9 million) \u2013 there is no question,\nin Deborah Shorley\u2019s opinion, as to where the\nsavings need to be made: publishers need to\ncut their prices.\nSo leads us to the remarkable story of Imperial College\u2019s self-effacing head librarian, pitted in a battle of nerves against the publisher of\ntitles like the Lancet. She is leading Research\nLibraries UK (RLUK), which represents the\nlibraries of Russell Group universities, in a\npublic campaign to pressure big publishers to\nend up-front payments, to allow them to pay in\nsterling and to reduce their subscription fees by\n15%. The stakes are high, library staff and services are at risk and if an agreement or an alternative delivery plan is not in place by January\n2nd next year, researchers at Imperial and elsewhere will lose access to thousands of journals.\nBut Deborah Shorley is determined to take it to\nthe edge if necessary: \u201cI will not blink.\u201d\nPre-2000, university libraries would subscribe to individual journal titles. They would\ntake a discerning look at the journals on offer and purchase only those that they explicitly desired. The primary mode of delivery\nwas print but at the Internet took bold strides\nforward and publishers invested time and\nmoney developing software that would allow\nresearchers to access papers and journals at\nthe click of a button, a new age of the \u201cbigdeal\u201d was born. Publishers offered access to\nthousands of journals \u2013 including back-issues,\nmeticulously and expensively digitized back to\nvolume one, issue one \u2013 at a marginally higher\ncost. Where before libraries would subscribe\nto a few hundred journals, their researchers\nnow had access to thousands.\nBut prices soon began to rise. The bulk\ndeals would include an approximate 6% price\nincrease year-on-year, well above inflation.\nWhy did libraries accept these increases?\nDavid Prosser, Executive Director of RLUK,\nsays that libraries didn\u2019t have much choice:\n\u201cIn the past the researchers have been saying\nto us that they need access to this material, so\npay for it. We had to pull out all the stops to\nmeet the demand and because we could find\nthe money to pay, we did.\u201d Publishers have defended the rises by pointing to the increased\nvolume of articles that publishers provide,\nabout 3% each year says a spokesman for\nthe Publishing Association (PA) \u2013 Elsevier\ndeclined to comment while Wiley Blackwell\nhad not responded to questions by the time\nof print. Include inflation with the increased\nvolume of articles, the PA argues, and the 6%\nprice increase is entirely reasonable. However,\nan institution like Imperial now accesses journals entirely electronically, which means that\nthough the volume of articles increases by 3%,\nthe associated costs do not.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that big publishers\nhave faced these sorts of criticisms. In June\n2010, the University of California (UC) threatened to boycott the Nature Publishing Group,\nwhich you could have guessed publishes Nature, after they tried to increase the cost of\ntheir subscription by a whopping 400%. In\na letter to its faculties, UC accused them of\nbeing \u201cunresponsive to the [financial] plight\nof libraries\u201d and urged its researchers to boycott the publisher if necessary by declining to\npeer review or edit for journals owned by the\nNature Publishing Group or even submit their\npapers to them. The letter spoke of the need\nto \u201cbreak the monopoly that commercial and\nfor profit entities like NPG hold over the work\nthat we create\u201d. The dispute was eventually\nresolved amicably but UC\u2019s comments were\nechoed by Robert Darnton, the Director of\nHarvard University Library, who in December 2010 called for the \u201cmonopolies of price-gouging publishers [\u2026] to be broken.\u201d\nPublishing companies can, by purchasing the\nmajor journals in an area of research, own a\nmonopoly in certain research topics. However,\nthe Publishing Association reject the accusation and say that publishing companies operate\nin a market and that researchers have a choice\nas to where to publish their papers and that libraries are free to negotiate on price. Deborah\nShorley points out that their contracts are subject to non-disclosure agreements meaning that\nthey can\u2019t compare prices with other universi-ties: \u201cWhich means that you\u2019re negotiating\nwith one hand tied behind your back.\u201d\nThe alternatives to reducing the cost of major subscriptions are quite unpalatable. Subscriptions to smaller publishers and learned\nsocieties could be the first to go. But ultimately resources must be protected says Deborah\nShorley. The result of this, which she admits is\ncontroversial, is that library staff are vulnerable to redundancy: \u201cIf I protect the staff but\nnot resources, it leaves no resources for staff to\nprovide.\u201d David Prosser claims that publishers\nwant libraries to cut staff in order to be able\nto afford the subscriptions: \u201cThe Publishing\nAssociation has told us that we should be saving money by sacking people. It\u2019s completely\nunimaginable for them to reduce their costs.\u201d\nHowever, the PA told Felix that they it is for\nlibraries to decide how to balance their books\nand, publicly at least, Elsevier has appeared\nsympathetic to library budget constraints,\ntelling the Wall Street Journal last November:\n\u201cThese are very difficult times, and we will\nwork with [libraries].\u201d\nIn the middle of these high-level nego-tiations, both public and private, are the re-searchers, who of course don\u2019t pay for their\nconsumption; when the cost is zero, demand is\ninfinite. RLUK, however, are searching for an\nalternative to the current arrangement with big\npublishers. They are developing a contingency\nplan which will allow them to walk away from\nthe publishers while reassuring academics that\ntheir research won\u2019t suffer. A \u201cworld expert in\ndocument supply\u201d, as Deborah Shorley refers\nto him, is developing the contingency plan at\nImperial. The plan will involve purchasing the\nmust-have, high-use journals individually (re-search has shown that 5% of journals account\nfor 40% of journal subscription use) and supplying other papers through document supply,\nwhich means that researchers are able to read\nan abstract and request delivery of the paper,\ncommonly from the British Library. Delivery\ntimes for document supply can be less than\ntwo hours electronically. Additionally, 10%\nof the material that libraries receive through\npaid subscriptions is already available through\nopen-access. Deborah Shorley is keen to work\nwith researchers, to help them avoid disruption if the contingency plan is needed, \u201cAt the\nbeginning of the next academic year, we\u2019ll be\noffering very practical help to researchers so\nthat they are as unaffected as possible.\u201d The PA\nis sceptical about RLUK\u2019s ability to replicate\nthe service that publishers currently provide,\nwhich Deborah Shorley admits will be diffi-cult. However, she argues that they will be able\nto go a long way to matching it and that any\nshort-term pain will be for long-term gain, \u201cwe\nwant researchers to be on board to understand\nthis is worth it in the long term.\u201d She stressed\nthat ideally they would not have to resort to the\ncontigency plan.\nStill, the libraries are adamant that they won\u2019t\nback down from their demands. The key, how-ever, to the struggle is how researchers respond\nto the debate. If they can be convinced that\nrising journal costs are threatening to compromise research in the long-term and that the contingency plan will allow them to continue their\nwork without much disruption, then the pressure on the publishers will be overwhelming.\nBut if researchers demand access to journals,\nwhatever the cost, libraries will be between a\nrock and a hard place. The fight for the hearts\nand minds of academics is crucial.\n\u201cThe fact is we don\u2019t have money in\nthe sector and we can\u2019t afford to go\non spending as we have.\u201d\n\u201cI WILL\nNOT BLINK\u201d\nDeborah Shorley,\nHead of Imperial\u2019s\nlibrary, will take\nBritain\u2019s biggest\npublishers to the\nedge if neccessary\nFeatures Editors: Lizzie Crouch\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n...Continued from Front Page\nJan Piotrowski\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

    "content": "Jakov Marelic\nfelix\nCOMMENT\nC omment Editor: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTime to meet your\nmalevolent maker\nI called shenanigans on the existence of\nGod at the tender age of ten. Even before\nI knew pie was more than something you\nthrew in 20\u2019s slapstick comedies it never\nmade sense to me for an omnipotent being\nto be benevolent, given that we have such\nterrible things in this world as Justin Bieber,\ntruly an apocalyptic horseman of our time.\nHe also never returned my prayers, but I\u2019m\nsure he was too busy setting bushes on fire\nlike some geriatric yob.\nThe fallacy in the previous argument is\nrather obvious but at the same time often\noverlooked because of what our idea of God\ngenerally is: some jolly old guy with a huge\nwhite beard who keeps a caring, watchful\neye over us \u2013 except when he\u2019s playing the\nodd round of golf with Satan to keep on good\nterms with him so that he can take all the\nannoying do-gooders that would otherwise\ngo to Heaven.\nNo. If God exists he is a jerk. Once you take\na minute to think about it, it explains everything so beautifully it brings a tear to my\neye. Earthquakes, tsunamis and volcano\neruptions happen because He just likes seeing the different ways he can ruin your day,\nlike a child pulling the wings and legs off a\nfly. Of course, on occasion good things do\nhappen, like winning the lottery or getting an\nexcellent in your latest lab cycle, but they\u2019re\nonly to build you up so you can be knocked\nback down again. It\u2019s a lot funnier to see Fernando Torres break his ankle than Stephen\nHawking.\nI\u2019m sure many of us would do the same;\nhistory is fraught with examples of dictators\nand Nazi doctors who probably weren\u2019t evil\nto begin with but inevitably did some really\nbad things simply because they could and\nwere divorced from the morality of their actions for whatever reason.\nGod\u2019s ultimate dick move, however, was\nwhen he made the laws of nature. In creating the second law of thermodynamics\nhe\u2019s essentially flipped the bird at us all by\nsaying everything is just going to get worse\nas time goes by. That loaf of bread going\nfrom brown to blue? Entropy is increasing.\nGetting lung cancer and dying? Yep, you\nguessed it. Shit getting worse is just the\nnatural order of things, and we as human\nbeings we have a tendency to resist this because we don\u2019t like bad things happening to\nourselves (exceptions include Catholics and\nsado-masochists).\nIn summary: if you want to get back at God\nfor all the ridiculous lecture timetables, flat\nbeer and cystic fibrosis he throws at us because he\u2019s an incredible dick, go do something amazing, like curing cancer.\nV\neli Akiner\nDigital books kindle unease\nT\nyrants and autocrats have always understood that literacy, learning, books\nand newspapers are potentially danger-ous. They can put independent and even\nrebellious ideas in the heads of their\nsubjects.\nFrederick Douglass, a former slave who taught\nhimself to read, recalled being found with books by\nhis master and punished. In 1828 he wrote: \u201cTo make\na contented slave it is necessary to make a thoughtless one.\u201d This is why reading and critical thinking\nare dangerous in an unjust society.\nThe British Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia wrote in 1671: \u201cI thank God there are no free schools\nnor printing; and I hope we shall not have [them].\u201d\nBut the American colonists, understanding where\nliberty lies, would have none of this and they enshrined free speech in their constitution.\nI see people using Kindles and Sony Readers instead of bound books and I worry they\u2019re giving away\ntheir birthright. Digital books require a lot of technical expertise to understand which is currently in the\nhands of very few people. The books you buy for\nmost e-book readers are encrypted with a secret key\nthat only a particular device can understand.\nYou might think that\u2019s okay because, hey, Amazon\nand Apple need to make money too, but consider\nwhat happens when they go out of business, or the\npower goes out and all those books are lost, inaccessible inside technological prisons.\nIn the past, authorities wanting to remove books\nfrom society would have to physically force their way\ninto everybody\u2019s homes, examine all their shelves and\nmake a massive bonfire to burn all the contraband.\nWith e\u2013book readers and an ethereal wireless internet that task is made so much easier. In 2009 Amazon\nrecalled two e\u2013books that customers had purchased\nwithout warning. Just to make this clear, a clerk sat\nin an office and pushed a button. It resulted in thousands of copies of books being deleted remotely from\nall Kindles worldwide. Ironically, those books were\nNineteen\u2013Eighty Four and Animal Farm by George\nOrwell.\nWith the Wikileaks drama a few weeks ago, we saw\nhow Amazon, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard and other\ncompanies will easily do the bidding of governments\nto control the population. I find it very easy to imagine that one day corporations or governments will\ngive the order and all copies of certain \u2018undesirable\u2019\nbooks will be remotely deleted.\nI\u2019ll keep my bound books for now. But we\u2019ve seen\nhow the Free Software movement promises to give\nyou complete control over your property and I don\u2019t\nsee why the same model can\u2019t be applied to e\u2013book\nreaders. What we need is a Linux for the Kindle, easy\nto install and available to all.\n\u201cI see people\nusing Kindles\nand worry they\u2019re\ngiving away their\nbirthright.\u201d\nJack Garnham\nManipulative mediums\n\u201cHave we been\nhere in a past\nlife? Let me save\nyou the trouble;\nthe answer is no.\u201d\nW\nhile enjoying one of my typically\nexciting weekday evenings (dur-ing which I systematically avoid\nany kind of social interaction\nand retreat to the comfort of my\ncouch), I stumbled upon a programme about past life\nregression presented by ethereal pundit Phillip Schofield. The grey-haired horseshit peddler asks one of\nthe most important questions of our time \u2013 have we\nbeen here in a past life?\nLet me save you the trouble; the answer is no.\nEach episode involves interrogating a suspiciously\nrelaxed Z\u2013list celebrity about their past lives. Comedian Eddie Large recalls being a Scottish warrior\nwearing \u201csome clothes\u201d and fighting in \u201csome field\nsomewhere,\u201d adding that \u201cit always happens in some\nfield.\u201d Compelling stuff. The programme hides behinds a paper\u2013thin veneer of objectivity, occasionally pointing out that it might all be a load of rubbish,\nwhile heavily implying the opposite.\nThis brief glimpse into the bizarre and confusing\nworld of the paranormal got me thinking. According\nto a recent study by sociologist Fabri Cation, an increasing number of people are being drawn in by this\nnonsense. We live in an age where otherwise logical\nindividuals read horoscopes daily, mothers hire baby-psychics, and, perhaps most distressingly, where Uri\nGeller can find repeated employment.\nDespite the rapid progress of science and the continued elucidation of the unknown, people insist on\ntaking advice from people with capes and crystal\nballs.\nFor the most part, casually dabbling in the curious\nworld of ghosts and ghouls is harmless. We can happily laugh at the vast majority of the wailing morons\nwho claim to have some link to the other side and\neasily refute their increasingly ludicrous claims with\na measured dose of common sense and rationality.\nMost people who believe in this absurd nonsense are\nlargely unharmed by their unfounded notions about\nreality. Sadly, there is a much more troubling side to\nthis story.\nThe human mind is a vulnerable thing. I have no\ngripe with psychics who strip the odd penny from\nthe deluded masses, but when they prey on those\ndistraught, fragile individuals who have recently\nlost a loved one, I start to think that locking them\nall up in windowless cells and leaving them to die\nalone might not be so unreasonable after all. It is\nhard to imagine how, but it is possible to become\naddicted to psychic consultations. In a state of such\nextreme despair, some will do anything to connect\nto a deceased familiar. The high achieved during a\nconsultation merely distracts the client from the real\nproblem, and prevents them from moving on. It is\ncertainly not a cheap distraction either; you can pay\nhundreds of pounds for a reading lasting less than\nan hour.\nThese psychics are exploiting vulnerable individuals in the most callous fashion imaginable with little\nconcern for their wellbeing. This part of the paranormal world is deeply corrupt. Perhaps there needs to\nbe some kind of regulatory body for psychic medi-ums, imposing appropriate fines for exploitative con-sultations. I personally think we should just put them\nall in one enormous bag and hit them with sticks until\nthey agree to go away.

We\nhurried down the steps to Brunel yesterday to meet a very nervous coach who\ninformed us we had four minutes to get\nweighed-in, the guys and girls hurried\nonto the scales to see if the morning ablutions had shaved off half a kilo.\nThrust onto the mat in front of a sizeable crowd (sadly missing some cheer-leaders), Imperial displayed some great\ntechnique and caused real problems for\nthe competition starting with the best\nJudo of the day from James Ko (U66kg)\nwho solidly beat all 5 of his opponents\nand claimed gold without seeming to\nbreak a sweat?! Nikola (U90kg), on the\nother hand, decided throws weren\u2019t his\nstyle and promptly threw the rules of\njudo out of the window. Instead of the\ntradition turn in and throw Nik pulled\nhis opponent to the ground and forced\nthem into an armlock Not exactly classy\nbut a bronze medal is a bronze medal.\nIn between the two were an impressive collection of two-handed hips\nthrows, drop throws and foot sweeps\nand a case of a particular person losing\na match through falling over their own\nfeet. Imperial dominated both men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s with Alice (U57kg) winning\ngold even though it was her first com-petition.\nThe black belts faced some incredibly\nJake Woods tough opposition against people with\nvarious things written on their back,\nworrying things like GBR and WALES.\nKarl (U81kg) was unlucky losing both\nhis fights to two of the best in the competition but Matt and Ed fought some\nheroic battles both losing only to the\neventual winner and had to settle for\nbronze and silver. Marie (U63kg) fought\nhard but unfortunately lost in the final\nand took home the silver.\nSo when the final medals were dished\nout Imperial came home with an impressive two gold, two silver and five bronze\nmedals (for Jake, Stefano, Bronwyn, Joe\nand Nik) and second in the competition\noverall. A great performance all round\nwith some huge throws from everyone,\nnot bad for a day\u2019s work as everyone\nlooks forward to BUCS.\nJudo: Imperial bring\nhome the medals at\nLondon Uni Judo Open\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

The aim of this conference was to present students with the\nopportunity to listen to experienced\nindustry professionals about issues that\nhave concerned the financial markets\nin the recent and not-so-recent past, as\nwell as to provide them with a set of\ninsights into the much debated world\nof finance; hopefully enabling them to\nmake up their own mind as to where the\nindustry is heading. This, along with\nthe networking opportunities available\nduring the breaks with the Finance Society\u2019s illustrious list of sponsors represented a unique experience for all\nstudents, many of whom are looking to\nenter a career in the financial markets\nand the banking industry in general.\nThe conference has been fathered and\nnurtured by Vishnu Aggarwal, whom\nwe wish to thank and congratulate with\nparticular emphasis; its success is a direct result of his professionalism, leadership and organisational skills and of\nthe motivation and attention to detail of\nthe team that supported and surrounded\nhim. The marketing and advertising of\nthe event was crucial as the attendance\nwas the gauge by which the success or\nfailure of this first conference would be\nmeasured. A very dedicated marketing\nteam did a fantastic job, which included setting up a website, sifting through\ndozens and dozens of CVs and applications as well as actively spamming and\nhunting down the chosen few in order\nto get them to pay the \u00a324 fee sooner\nrather than later (we would like to\nstress that it is a very reasonable price\ntag considering that other conferences\ncharge upwards of \u00a375). The efforts of\nthe marketing team did not go unanswered and many of the 250 delegates\nwere drafted from a wide range of top\nuniversities such as LSE, Warwick,\nUCL and Imperial College itself.\nIt is, however, worth noticing that the\norganisation of this event was no pic-nic; rather it was a lengthy, difficult and\nslightly painful funeral luncheon. Selecting a venue in central London was the\nfirst challenge, but the society managed\nto secure a very prestigious location, the\nBloomberg headquarters. Its most remarkable trademarks are the many fish\ntanks and modern art exhibits scattered\naround the building as well as the wide\nselection of complimentary food and\ndrinks available throughout the day, of\nwhich delegates and speakers alike took\nadvantage quite unceremoniously. The\nselection of speakers was next on the todo list; thanks to the extensive network\nof corporate sponsors of the Finance\nSociety, Vishnu and his acolytes would\ncontact various senior professionals currently working in the City or otherwise\nemployed (or unemployed). The speakers were selected from a wide range of\nbackgrounds and their contributions\nwere very varied; from a renowned\nmaths Professor dishing out formulae,\nto a former investment banker revealing\ninside stories of a credit-crunch-struck\nbank; from a gloomy perspective of an\ninevitable financial doomsday, to an optimistic view on junk bonds, there was\nsomething for everybody.\nThe day kicked off with a very inter-esting, albeit challenging talk on high\nFriday 18 February 2011\nyield bonds by Teo Lasarte of Bank of\nAmerica Merrill Lynch, followed by a\nvery engaging viewpoint on the broad\nthemes in commodities given by the\nlively Morgan Stanley duo Michael\nBrennan & Russell Dyk. The attendees then got told how to deal with risk\nby Professor Lane Hughston and were\nmade aware that society as we know\nit may cease to exist due to a deadly\ncocktail of debt, population growth,\nageing, climate change and peak oil\nproduction by Dr. Mike Haywood. After a well deserved break, guests were\nable to attend three different workshops\norganised by Amplify Trading; the first\ntwo dealt with market analysis where a\nvideo of frantic trading around the major news flow of the non-farms payroll\ndata, while the third dealt with trading\npsychology. The feedback on these\nworkshops was extremely positive and\neverybody was very enthusiastic about\nit. The afternoon was kick-started with\na valuable talk on what sparked the financial crisis by the very experienced\nformer Societe Generale\u2019s Global Head\nof Fixed income and FX, Mr. Desclaux,\nfollowed by talks from Mr. Simmonds,\nthe Global Head of Strategy and Research at RBS as well as Mrs. Flax,\nthe EMEA CEO of Commodities at JP\nMorgan about their respective industry\nsectors. The day ended with a panel discussion mediated by Philip Alexander,\na journalist at \u2018The Banker\u2019 magazine.\nThe panel discussing the future of banking included Kiri Vijayarajah, the European Banks analyst at Barclays Capital\namong other figures. It was then time\nto head for some well-deserved complimentary drinks for organisers and\nguests at a bar near Liverpool Street;\ndetails of that part of the day are unworthy of a newspaper of this stature and\nare probably quite hazy for most participants anyway.\nOverall, the conference has achieved\nthe aims it was designed for; it has\nbeen informative without being bor-ing, factual, as jargon-free as possible,\ninteractive and challenging. The feedback from both speakers and delegates\nhas been overwhelmingly positive and\nboth parties found that a real exchange\ntook place, especially during the lunch\nbreak and during the Q&A sessions after each talk. The Finance Society intends to hold such an event next year as\nwell; the very wide appeal this conference has had, combined with its quality and affordability, will ensure that it\nwill grow and become more successful\nevery year and eventually overtake in\nfame and glory other, more established,\nequivalents.\n\u201cIt has been\ninformative without\nbeing boring, factual,\nas jargon-free as\npossible, interactive\nand challenging.\u201d\nHey! Lady in the middle, stop playing Angry Birds and pay attention. You don\u2019t see beige jacket woman slacking off, do you? That\u2019s why she\u2019s going straight to the top baby!\nFlorian Rathgeber\n\n"

ARTSFEST is different, he as-serts, because \u201cwe start with great talent\nand end by having a good time together.\u201d\nThe week kicks off on Monday 21st\nFebruary with a free lunchtime concert\nin the Business School Foyer from Imperial College Sinfonietta. From then\non, in various strategic locations around\nCollege, buskers will compete for a\nshare of your lunch money from 1-2pm\nevery day. Jazz & Rock will rock Metric on Thursday along with a set from\nMusictech Live and to top it off, an entire multitude of bands, ensembles and\nperforming groups will come together\nfor the Finale on Friday 25th, the jewel\nin the ARTSFEST crown and by far its\nmost popular night.\nFrom Hawaiian hula dance to swing\nband jazz to Shakespeare, the ARTSFEST Finale screams variety. In previous years, choral works and martial arts\nperformances have made appearances;\nif the standard of bygone Finales is an\nindicator, this year\u2019s audience will certainly not be disappointed. \u201cThere really\nis something for everyone, and you\u2019ll\ndiscover your friends\u2019 hidden talents,\u201d\nSilver enthuses. \u201cMy biggest hope is\nthat it will inspire you to give at least\none of our incredible arts societies a try.\u201d\nConcerts and shows are only part of\nARTSFEST: the 23rd of February will\nsee \u201cWorkshop Wednesday\u201d, where\nclubs and societies throw open their\ndoors and share their expertise with any\nenthusiastic Imperial student or member\nof staff. From learning how to sing like\nthe Techtonics to Belly Dancing (wom-en only!) to theatre workshops from\nDramSoc, next Wednesday\u2019s free workshops will be for some the highlight of\nthe festival.\nIn Silver\u2019s words, \u201cARTSFEST is a\nway for us to discover the fantastic creativity that\u2019s going on under our own\nnoses, give ourselves a pat on the back\nfor being artistic scientists, and still raise\nmoney for an excellent cause in the process.\u201d\nThis year, revenue from busking and\ncollections at all ARTSFEST events will\nbe donated to the British Heart Foundation, to coincide with National Heart\nMonth.\nARTSFEST 2011 takes place from the\n21st until the 25th of February 2011. All\nevents are open to all staff, students and\nvisitors. All but ROCKFEST and the Finale are absolutely free (just \u00a32 and \u00a35\nrespectively).

    "content": "FELIX 9\nINTERVIEW\nwho receive bursaries, to find out how\nthey feel their bursary helps them and\nalso how they think it should be targeted\nin terms of a fee waiver or cash in hand.\nPersonally, as someone who received\na full bursary for my time at Imperial,\nI found that the difficulty in coming to\nImperial was the living costs and for\nthat you need cash in hand. That\u2019s extremely important for widening access.\nDo you think that fees of \u00a39,000 exacerbate issues with access?\nI do accept that there is deterrence in\ndebt, which is the mountain that we all\nhave to climb. One thing that Imperial\ncan start doing straight away is advertising what bursaries are on offer before\npeople apply. I don\u2019t think people have\na clue about the bursaries on offer until\nthey arrive here by which point it\u2019s too\nlate to widen access. It does help that\nthe national conversation is about the\nfact that you need to widen access and\nimprove bursaries if you want to charge\n\u00a39,000 because then students will know\nwhen they see \u00a39,000 that there are good\nbursaries etc. that\u2019s the mindset we need.\nThe Union passed a policy last term,\nwhich backed the Browne Review.\nIt talked about bursaries but it also\nbacked unlimited fees. Is this going to\nbe revisited, tweaked and altered?\nYes, in fact we\u2019ll be doing that at the next\nCouncil meeting. I wanted to change it\nin response to the survey we\u2019re hopefully going to do about bursaries, to put in\nsomething about higher education fund-ing, where the Union believes bursaries\nshould come from, where they should\ngo and how they should be distributed.\nAnd we may need to revisit other parts\nof it also.\nWould you say that there isn\u2019t a good\nknowledge about what Imperial students think about higher education\nfunding?\nYes probably. It\u2019s relatively hard to\njudge and you can\u2019t keep doing endless surveys. But there\u2019s a point to make\nthat just to cover its costs Imperial has\nto raise fees. The funding isn\u2019t going to\ncome from anywhere else. There is simply no choice, regardless of my opinion,\nregardless of any student\u2019s opinion; they\nhave no choice but to raise fees to a\ncertain level. So spending time gathering opinions about \u201cdo you think fees\nshould rise above \u00a33,225?\u201d is, I would\nsay, pointless. However, I do think that\nit\u2019s worthwhile to find out what people think about the difference between\n\u00a36,000 and \u00a39,000, as in; do you have\n\u00a36,000 and less financial aid or \u00a39,000\nand an impressive packet of financial\naid?\nThe Union is currently working to\nmake hall rents more transparent.\nYes we are, the idea originally came up\nbecause I was surprised that first years\npay for the fact that we have free Ethos\nmembership from their hall rents. Technically it comes from the whole commercial services budget but if people paid for\nmembership, hall rents would be cheap-er. That\u2019s one side of the debate; I\u2019m definitely not suggesting that people should\nstart paying for Ethos. Commercial Services have been very helpful in giving us\na breakdown of what makes up the rent,\naside from the fundamentals like electricity etc. There were five things: Ethos,\nthe Amenities Fund, Cleaning (which\nyou can argue isn\u2019t a fundamental), the\ncontract length and the cost of warden-ing \u2013 but that\u2019s being addressed by the\nwardening review and I\u2019m not going to\neven touch that subject.\nIs it right that people pay into an\namenities fund that is used to fund\nsocial events, when for example that\nmoney is used to buy alcohol and they\ndon\u2019t even drink?\nThe amenities fund is for paying for\nsocial events. There\u2019s a debate to be\nhad about whether people think the\namenities fund should be scrapped entirely and people can pay directly for the\nevents that they attend. But something\nthat I think is a fundamental principle is\nthat no alcohol should be funded from\nthe amenities fund. For a start, we in the\nunion don\u2019t allow clubs and societies\nto buy food or alcohol from their grant\nmoney because they\u2019re consumables;\nyour participation in a club shouldn\u2019t affect on whether you can or can\u2019t have\ncertain consumables and so it shouldn\u2019t\naffect your participation in a hall either.\nThe fact that some students are subsidis-ing others to drink alcohol is, I think,\nquite immoral. I\u2019m very interested to\nhear what students who don\u2019t drink al-cohol, because of their religious beliefs,\nthink about this since they\u2019re effectively\nsubsidising other people to do so.\nDo you think they drag their feet on\nthese problems?\nYes but the issue in EEE was slightly\ndifferent. That department was probably the best; they at least arranged a\nmeeting where they explained the situation to students. But with the Aero and\nBusiness School issues, they can say\nthat it\u2019s all about miscommunication but\nI\u2019ve seen the emails and I\u2019ve heard what\nstudents affected have said and it just\ndoesn\u2019t match up. So now we\u2019re asking\nPhD students to monitor their bursaries\nand how much they are paid and their\nconditions more vigilantly.\ning to get bands and artists in, they do\ncharge money and it costs us to run the\nplace. On the other side, if you charge too\nmuch you deter students even if there\u2019s a\ndrink offer. It\u2019s extremely hard to judge\nbut we\u2019re sensitive to student concerns\nabout pricing and we have been changing\nprices, using different models. I will say\nthat it\u2019s never, except for big events like\nthe Winter Ball, going to be more than \u00a35\nonline beforehand. I think that\u2019s pretty\nreasonable for a club on Friday until 2am.\nOne thing that was criticised was serving shark burgers, which is a sensitive\nissue. Was that the right thing to do?\nI\u2019m not going to say whether it was right\nor not, commercial services decided\nto do these different types of meat and\nthey decided that shark would be one\nof them. It appeared and it was certified\nshark meat, it\u2019s not an endangered species but at the same time I was aware\nthat this area is particularly sensitive so I\nasked them to take it off. However, with\nthe food people generally seem to like\nwhat we\u2019ve got this year; I haven\u2019t heard\na great deal of negative feedback. It was\nabout getting more variety and the menu\nis a lot bigger than it was last year.\nFinally, have you enjoyed the job?\nI have really enjoyed it. It has been demanding trying to get students to engage\nmore and express their opinions. For ex-ample, Felix had lots of stuff about the\nBrowne Review, we were putting information out, we had a paper to council, we\nwere the only student union to support\nit actually and yet no one who wasn\u2019t a\ncouncil member came to council for the\ndebate. I suspect that this isn\u2019t an indicte-ment of Imperial students, that this is not\nbecause of apathy but because actually,\na university like Imperial is full of people who do understand the value of their\ndegree; charging more for it isn\u2019t going\nto have such an effect if they get the bur-sary scheme right. Overall though, this\nyear hasn\u2019t been all about fee rises; there\nis plenty about the job to find stressful,\nbut also plenty to find inspiring. You get\nout what you put in.\nHall Rents\nPhD Funding\nPhD funding has been a big issue this\nyear. Three departments \u2013 Aero, EEE\nand the Business School \u2013 have had\nproblems.\nYes it has. I have brought this up with\nCollege management. Pro-Rector (Ed-ucation) Julia Buckingham has been\nextremely helpful. She\u2019s been very\nconcerned and has investigated and\nresolved the issues. The problem is\nthat when the College point out there\u2019s\nsomething wrong, the department does\nsomething; when students do they just\nshrug their shoulders. It seems to be that\nthey\u2019re hoping that students don\u2019t notice\nor don\u2019t care.\nThe Union\nMetric and FiveSixEight have been\nwell received, but what still needs to\nbe improved?\nThe one thing that we really do need\nto get right, which is still a problem, is\nthe pricing in metric, which has been a\npermanent thorn in our side. Some students say that it should be free but you\nstill have to run a business. If you\u2019re go\u201cIt seems to be that\nthey\u2019re hoping that\nstudents don\u2019t notice\nor don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cThe pricing in Metric\n[...] has been a thorn\nin our side.\u201d\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX 33\nT\nhere are many reasons why\nwe eat, sometimes we eat\nto fill that rumbling stomach \u2014 a purely physiological requirement, but other\ntimes, we eat for our hearts and (corny\nas can be, I know), our souls. Many of\nus are rather methodical about food,\ntreating food as an invariant, a necessity\nto tick off the daily list. I\u2019m not saying\nthat it is wrong to have such a pragmatic\nview about food, but it is rather a shame;\nit is untapped potential. No, foodies\nlike us are not food snobs. We appreciate food (sometimes obsessively) but\nwe don\u2019t expect everyone to treat food\nwith as much intimacy as we do. It is\nextremely unfortunate if we are thoughtless about eating though.\nMore often that not, it is not just the\nfood; it is the act of eating and the stories we build around food; it is the gathering of friends around a table and their\nleaving hours later. Food is disarming, it\nmakes everyone more receptive.\nFood should be more than mere sus-tenance, it is more than just fuel for the\nbody \u2014 food can feed us in so many\nother enriching ways. Life would be so\nmuch more vivid if we take a daily ritual\nand turn it into a celebration. If we need\nto eat everyday, why not make an effort\nto make eating enjoyable? It magnifies the moments we find joy in, and it\nheightens the festivity of daily life.\nThe smell of roasted potatoes conjures\nimages of Christmas past, and the nuanced fragrances of freshly brewed tea\nis lubricant for conversation \u2014 it is alchemy of the highest order. The velvety\nsmoothness of a cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e screams\nindulgence, the heady scents of a beef\nstew signal the start of the chilly months\nand a tart made from plump and flavourful stone-fruits, so effortlessly charm-ing. We have five senses, so use them.\nEat to live? Live to eat?\nChinhua Yap implores you to enjoy the finer details of food\nmaria kl\u00e4rner/flickr\nWho\u2019d have thought? A toffee apple is another way to apply lipstick, albeit it may require some skill...\nThe moments shared alongside food\nevoked by the mere whiff of familiar\nsmells and the taste of shared memories.\nThe simple act of having eggs (over-easy, please) for breakfast instead of\ncereal (again) can make every morning\nfeel like a luxurious weekend \u2014 food\ncan be transformative.\nEnjoy every mouthful: appreciate the\ntextural adventure, the contrast in flavours and the intensity of the moment.\nEvery meal can be a bookmark in your\nautobiography, and you can indulge in\nas many dog-eared pages as you\u2019d like.\nRemind yourself to consciously scribe\nfood experiences into your memory. It\nis like making an inventory, but not for\nbolts and screws, rather, for a box of histories waiting to be rediscovered and for\nindulging and celebrating with.\nYes, I\u2019m celebrating \u2014 I\u2019m having a\nhot cup of tea and a gently warmed up\nscone. It is glorious. I live to eat.\nFriday 18 february 2011\nAfter having a long, drawn out and indulgent dinner, what does one have\nwhilst engaging in sophisticated conversation and to cleanse the palate after\nthe cheese board? To continue drinking\nwine simply lacks imagination, besides\nit wouldn\u2019t be best suited to aid diges-tion. Fortunately a whole genre of drink\nhas been developed over the past several\nhundred years purely for this purpose, I\nam of course writing about the digestif.\nTypically these beverages are in the\nform of sweet, yet deceptively strong\n(usually 40%, or more) liqueurs though\nthere are more bitter alternatives available and fortified wines, such as port,\nwhich are often drunk in the same set-ting. We\u2019ll look at the former for simplic-ity. Despite how delicious these liqueurs\nmay be, I wouldn\u2019t recommend one to\nbinge drink large quantities of them,\npurely for financial reasons of course.\nGran Marnier\nA personal favourite of mine, this co-gnac-based orange liqueur has a beautiful gold orange tint. Its flavour hails\nfrom the peel of bitter oranges. If juices\nwere used then it wouldn\u2019t have the\nsame sweet taste. The uses of this drink\ngo further than a digestif. When eating\npoffertjes (small Dutch pancakes), it is\naccompanied by icing sugar and butter.\nIt is used in cocktails such as the Dirty\nHarry, which I believe is Clint Eastwood\u2019s favourite.\nCointreau\nGran Marnier\u2019s dark and mysterious\nbrother. This triple sec is completely\ncolourless with a lighter taste; where as\nGran Marnier has a deeper, orange fla-vour. It is made from sweet and bitter\noranges.\nChartreuse\nPossibly the most famous herbal liqueur\nof all; I often think of this as Listerine\nthat you can swallow. Usually seen in\nits green form, it can also be yellow, and\nis made by monks in the Grande Chartreuse Monastery, near Grenoble. Best\nenjoyed on an Alpine chalet balcony.\nDrambuie\nThis scotch liqueur, flavoured with\nhoney is, as legend has it, a product of\na secret recipe given to the rescuer of\nBonnie Prince Charlie. The main use of\nthe beverage is introducing youngsters\nto the taste of whisky, thus is very, very\ndangerous.\nLimoncello\nGenerally liked, this Italian lemon liqueur has become more popular in recent years and is commonly served in\nrestaurants. Unlike the other beverages\nmentioned so far, Limoncello must be\nserved ice cold, so if you have a bottle at\nhome then put it in the freezer now. You\ncan very easily make this one at home\nwith vodka, sugar and lemon peel/ zest.\nSloe Gin\nArmies of housewives across the\ncountry must have felt redundant when\nGordon\u2019s started manufacturing sloe\ngin. The making of sloe gin is one of\nthose quaint great British institutions,\nwhich I for one, admire. Once the sloe\n(blackthorn) berries have been picked,\neach berry must be pricked and placed\nin a container with gin and sugar. Sugar\nis necessary to infuse the flavours into\nthe gin. The infusion takes several\nmonths to a year, needing a vigorous\nshake every now and again. The fruit\nmust be extracted once ready.\nYou can make homemade liqueur with\nany fruit of your choice, sugar and a\nneutral spirit, though how it\u2019s served can\nvary. In countries such as Holland, the\nliqueur isn\u2019t left to mature for very long\nand is served with the fruit. It is more\ncommon in England to drink the liqueur\nby itself.\nIngredients:\n\u00b7 Eggs (2-3 per person)\n\u00b7 Some butter\n\u00b7 Seasoning\nTime: ~25 minutes.\nImpress your friends!

    "content": "The Summer Ball\nEnd of year summer exams, nobody likes them. It\nis the best way to ruin the best season of the year\nand everyone dreads them. But now there\u2019s something epic to look forward to, because this year,\nnot only is there an end of year summer ball, but\nthere\u2019s a whole day of live performances to go with\nit.\nBasically, the Union is planning a festival, with\nevents scattered across the Imperial campus.\nPlans are underway for various activities to take\nplace during the day, giving the Summer Ball a more\n\u2018festival-esque\u2019 feel.\nThe Union are going all out this year \u2013 not only\nare they adding in the all-day festival but they will\nhave live music (including more student acts) on a\nlarge stage in Queen\u2019s Lawn and a smaller stage\nin Princes Gardens. In addition to this there will be\nupmarket food and various other stalls.\nThe Union says that they\u2019re moving away from\nthe standard formal dinner approach and are trying\nsomething different this year. The possibility of collaborating with other London universities is also being considered, to make the event bigger and better\nthan ever (and to have a wider range of acts).\nTaking you back to your primary school summers,\nthere are plans for more \u2018fun-fair\u2019-like activities to\ntake place on the day of the ball and the Union aim\nfor the festival to end with \u2018enough time to finish\nyour drinks and catch the tube home if you want\u201d\naccording to Deputy President (Finances & Services) Ravi Pall, with the after-party continuing after in\nFiveSixEight and Metric, as well as the Great Hall.\nSo when is this ultra-spectacular and unmissable\nevent? The date for your diaries folks is the 18th of\nJune (conveniently chosen as a date close to the\nend of exams so that all students can attend). It\u2019ll\nundeniably be a great way to celebrate the end of\nanother great year at Imperial.\nAemun Reza\nNEWS\nFELIX\n6\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGovernment signals \u00a39,000\nfee restrictions\nGeneieve Pugh\nImperial\u2019s plan to join the gentlemen\u2019s club of\nuniversities charging the maximum \u00a39,000 for\ntuition fees from the 2012 academic year will\ncome with restrictions from the government.\nNick Clegg has said in a recent BBC interview that \u201cuniversities can only charge \u00a39,000\nif they are given permission to do so\u201d. If Imperial wants to charge fees of more than \u00a36,000\nit must have an access agreement approved by\nthe Office for Fair Access (OFFA). This sets\nout the measures it would use to maintain and\nimprove access to the university for students\nfrom underprivileged backgrounds. This is the\ngovernment\u2019s attempt to remove the barriers to\nhigher education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds that increased fees would\ninevitably produce.\nClegg\u2019s view is that \u201cuniversities can and\nshould do more to ensure fair access. \u2026social mobility in this country has stalled. It will\nonly improve if we throw open the doors of\nuniversities, especially the most selective, to\nmore bright students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201d\nLast Thursday, a letter was sent by Vince\nCable, Business Secretary, and David Willetts,\nUniversities Minister, to OFFA \u201csetting out\nthe Government\u2019s expectations in respect of\nfair access to higher education\u201d. It introduces\nsignificant changes to the access agreements\nthat colleges must submit to OFFA if they wish\nto charge more than the new baseline fee of\n\u00a36,000 for 2012 entry. The letter also suggests\nthat universities like Imperial should make\nlower offers to students from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds.\nIf Imperial wants to introduce the maximum\nfees or indeed charge above the \u00a36,000 mark in\ngeneral, OFFA will require demonstration of a\nreal measurable progress against agreed benchmarks for fair access. Their requirements could\ninclude a reduction in drop out rate, more investment in access measures if progress against\nagreed benchmarks is not sufficient and an annual review of their access agreement.\nOFFA\u2019s job now is to draw up detailed guidance for universities. Sir Martin Harris, Director of Fair Access, said the aim is to publish\nthis guidance towards the end of February.\nUniversities must submit their access agreements in April and these will be assessed and\nagreed by mid July.\nThe government is also introducing a national scholarship programme that will provide a reduction of fees by at least \u00a33,000 for\nstudents from disadvantaged backgrounds, to\nhelp them cope with their mammoth university fees.\nBut how effective will this policy be in resolving the issues of social mobility the government has highlighted? The proposals have\nbeen criticized by Graham Stuart, Tory Chairman of the Education Select Committee, who\nsaid: \u201cany university admissions policy that\nfocuses on factors other than the merit of the\nstudent is misguided. \u2026.We need to improve\nthe quality of schooling, not dumb down the\nentry requirements for universities.\u201d\nImperial announces \u00a39,000 fees\nfirmed that the Union would be trying to survey\nthe 27% of Imperial students who receive bur-saries about \u201chow they feel their bursary helps\nthem, and also how they think it should be targeted in terms of a fee waiver or cash in hand.\u201d\nWith tuition fees set to rise, the issue of access to financial aid such as bursaries becomes\nan ever more important one. Presently Imperial has a means tested fund of \u00a34 million to\ndistribute, of which \u00a33.5 million is from tuition\nfees and \u00a30.5 million is from the endowment.\nWith cuts to government funding, Kendall cau-tioned, \u201cthe university may not be able to afford the \u00a33.5 million give in bursaries unless\n[...] Imperial charges higher fees\u201d. Earlier this\nmonth, Kendall spoke about the discussions\nwithin the working group about how bursa-ries will be allocated. It is Imperial\u2019s fear that\nthe government may demand \u2018fee remission\u2019,\nwhereby students will not be able to use the\nmoney for living costs \u2013 a highly contentious\nissue for students living in London. Kendall\ncontinued, \u201cFor a London university, we know\nthat living costs are the most expensive factor\nat university, and the current loan and grant\nonly just covers this. Preventing [students]\nfrom using the bursary to top this up is a mistake\u201d. O\u2019Nions recognized that Imperial still\nhas \u201ca way to go in our considerations about\nwhat forms of financial aid would attract and\nsupport the most able, but needy, students\u201d but\nhighlighted that \u201cfor those who can manage\nImperial\u2019s courses, the College will work to\nensure they can manage its costs.\u201d\nWhile the costs may be manageable, many\nmay be unwilling to take on such large debts\nbefore they are economically independent.\nWith the crushing toll of the recession, both the\nfinancially deprived and the squeezed middle\nclass are more aware than ever of the result\nsuch large debts will have on their lives. Concerns that world class education will only be\navailable to the very richest are still very much\npresent. Whilst Imperial has an academically\nelitist image, many are concerned that this\nelitism might extend into the cross-section of\nsociety Imperial attracts. O\u2019Nions highlighted\nthat the college has \u201cplans for a long-term\ncampaign for philanthropic support [...] to attract the brightest and the best in the world for\ngenerations to come.\u201d Nonetheless, whether\nthese plans will yield their intended results is\nanother matter; anxiety is still expressed by numerous students despite the many reassurances\nof financial aid. With questions surrounding\nthe diversity of the student population already\narising, how Imperial will ensure that students\nfrom poorer backgrounds continue to apply remains an unclear but important issue.\nTinie Tempah at last year\u2019s Summer Ball. Give us\nBieber this year! Please?\n...Continued from Front Page\nNick Clegg is obviously not pleased about having his sandwich stolen by the kid. But\nthen again, he did just steal away the kid\u2019s future. Oh yeah, I went there...\nFriday 18 february 2011\nTim Smith\n\n"

    "content": "A R T S\nFELIX\n26\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nAn exhibition about mind-altering drugs\nis likely to elicit the curiosity of nearly\neveryone, since most of us are at least\noccasional consumers. Remember how\nfull the Union is of inebriated students\nsome nights of the week? So, I was\nready to be surprised by what of artistic\nvalue anyone could produce under the\ninfluence of psychotropic drugs.\nHigh Society is the title of the current exhibition at the Wellcome Trust\nFoundation, a charity whose aim is to\nsupport innovation in the medical sci-ences. Their exhibitions try to bridge the\ngap between the sciences and the arts \u2013\nwhich may be an added bonus for you,\nor might have you running for the hills\nalready. For my part, I was curious and\nwilling to give it a try. Even better, the\nexhibit it free of charge, which is always\na plus for someone on a student budget.\nOn arriving at the Wellcome Gallery I\nkept imagining what awaited me, bearing in mind the imagery of the sixties\nand psychedelic rock. However, the\nexpectations that the poster, with its vibrant colours and Alice-in-Wonderland\ncaterpillar, had provoked were soon\nshattered. At first sight nothing caught\nmy eye. At the main entrance there is\na stand full of objects from throughout\nhistory related to drug use, from shisha pipes to needles. In general, there\nwas a great variety in what was being\ndisplayed, from projections to photographs to old posters used to discourage\nthe consumption of alcohol. The exhibit\nwas well thought out; however, the exhibition area was not spacious enough for\nall that was on display.\nOne of the most interesting pieces was\na \u201cDream Machine\u201d by Brion Gyson.\nPlaced in a dark room, a spiralling cylinder with bright patterns rotates quickly ,\nallegedly capable of inducing a trance as\nthe observer stares at the changing pat-terns. A series of small pictures hanging\non the wall caught my attention too. The\nthemes they portrayed were unrelated \u2013\none was a picture of a fractal and the other one was the image of an Indian god.\nAfter detailed inspection I realised the\npaper had tiny squares drilled on it.

There was also a huge sculpture representing an opium pipe, which\nwas actually pretty tacky. One wall was\ncovered with three diagrams of a spider\nweb.

Coupled to this is the fluidity of time;\nwhile some characters are impossibly old and it\ncan rain for years on end, there are contrasting moments when Marquez dismisses decades with a few\nstrokes of his pen. This dreamlike and subjective\nway in which the various stories are told hint at the\nway we perceive our own lives: looking back at the\nmultitude of events which unfold over the novel, it is\nstressed that memories are fleeting impressions of\nmoments, an incomplete picture.\nAt the centre of Marquez\u2019s writings are always his\ncharacters. Richly developed and too numerous to\nkeep track of, it is easy to become lost. Eventually\ncomes the realisation that this is not too great a\nproblem. New generations of children mature only\nto commit the same acts as their ancestors \u2013 the\ncircularity of history is obviously important to Marquez.\nPresent in the novel is page after page of vivid\ndescription and imagery, much of it devoted to his\ncharacter\u2019s love lives. The style is romantic but not\nclich\u00e9d. Rather than Hollywood style heroes overcoming obstacles to find eternal love and happi-ness, Marquez\u2019s characters are much more flawed,\nand much more human. Would be heroes are struck\ndown by the size of their own egos (and sometimes\nlibidos) amidst echoes of Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cwill to power\u201d. Those who endure solitude find that it is strongest when they are surrounded by others \u2013 a theme\nmore relevant now than ever, in our world of urban\nalienation. Finally, the would-be poetic bubble is often punctured by the author\u2019s own sharp, if seemingly crude, wit.\nTo me, this is a magnificent work. Despite what\nthe title suggests it is as much a celebration of the\nfull richness of human emotion rather than just soli-tude. Bravado, ecstasy, love and blind lust are all\nportrayed within, along with their consequences.

There were the\nusual arse\u2013faced drunk Facebook pho-tographs, of course. But mixed in with\nthese were some unbelievable \u2018hilarious\u2019posters offering a buffet of horrible,\ninsulting slogans like a Cadbury\u2019s selection box of human faeces.\nThe worst of the lot is the photo of\nGeorge Osbourne holding the Budget\naloft with \u201cThey See Me Cuttin\u2019, They\nHatin\u2019\u201d written underneath, although the\none with Cameron laughing at people\nwho will have to pay for their own education is pretty bad. You might be happy\nfor these people to express their political\nviews as an exercise in Freedom of Expression, but you\u2019re forgetting that your\nIndy Leclerq\nopinion is incorrect while mine is quite\nthe opposite. So be quiet and let me tell\nyou a thing or two.\nFrankly, I could take or leave Political\nScrapbook. I\u2019ve flicked through, and as\nthey state themselves, it\u2019s mostly gossip\nand rumour. Finger\u2013pointing, that kind\nof thing. The sort of character\u2013building\nstuff that trains up student politicians to\nbecome the self\u2013cleaning cat\u2019s arsehole\nthey\u2019ve dreamed of being since their ALevel Politics lessons. But I don\u2019t mind\nit because, on the whole, it\u2019s just poking fun at silly things. If you remove the\nsilly things from the world of internet\nopinion\u2013sharing, you\u2019re left with MySpace. And nobody wants that.\nBut the YUYC group pisses me off a\nlittle more because it\u2019s just creating a\nclosed\u2013off social group, and then shitting on those who aren\u2019t within the cir-cle. I don\u2019t do politics because it bores\nme witless and because there are few\ngenuine debates nowadays, but no matter what sphere of human smuggery you\ntry to engage in, be it academia, government or otherwise, there are always\nthose eager to divide people up and emphasise difference.\nMy position works because I don\u2019t differentiate \u2013 I have a badge with words\non to that effect; I simply hate everyone.\nThe alternative is to try to like every-one. Elizabeth Lesser is a cofounder of\nAmerica\u2019s Omega Institute, dedicated\nto adult education. She gave a TED talk\nabout the benefit of taking someone\nyou disagree with to lunch. It\u2019s a good\ntalk, you should watch it, but the take\u2013\nhome message was that divisions generally don\u2019t help people. We end up in the\nstate we are politically \u2013 a state where\nwe don\u2019t want to discuss the issues, and\ninstead governments fight on public im-age, pandering to large demographics,\nand bullshit.\nNow for all you care, I think Elizabeth\nLesser is a hack. Because my position\nis that you can all go fuck yourselves.\nMore to the point, I\u2019d rather tear apart\nand devour the chargrilled carcasses of\nthe YUYC than take them out to lunch\nand understand them. But that doesn\u2019t\nmean you should. So be sure not to let\nus ever get as hate\u2013filled and feckless\nas York University, and be sure to invite\nthe Tories the next time you make dinner plans.\nP\nicture the scene: the Olympic Stadium, East London,\nless than a year and a half\nfrom now, on a balmy August evening. There is little\nwind; the heat is slowly rising from the\ntrack. The atmosphere is heavy, but that\nhas little to do with the weather. The entire world\u2019s gaze is fixed upon the ten\nmen at one end of the track. Never before has one event monopolised the attention of so many people. Cameras are\neverywhere, and for the first time, people are watching in 3D.\nThe Olympics website is riding a\nhumongous wave of tweets, as people\nvoice their support for the athletes. Selected 140\u2013character cheers are beamed\nacross screens in the stadium. The organisers have pulled off the first Olympics 2.0, they say; the public is closer\nthan ever to the action. Or are they?\nWhile the London games next year\nwill no doubt be a logistical and technological masterclass, I can only hope that\nthe organisers achieve one of the most\nimportant aspects: getting the people\ninto the venues.\nThere are 8.8 million tickets going\non sale in less than a month, for 645\nevents in 26 different sports. So far, so\ngood, you might think. However, almost\nten percent of the tickets will cost over\nAngry Geek\n\u00a3100, which makes the London games\nthe most expensive in history. Here\u2019s\nto the corporate fat cats in their boxes,\nthen. Never mind, that leaves seven\u2013odd\nmillion tickets for the rest of us, no?\nI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to\nstart saving up, though. With the new\ntuition fees, (big up to Imperial for always being a pioneer, by the way \u2013 we\nset the bar in fees as well as academic\nstandards) spending fifty quid on an\nOlympics ticket isn\u2019t going to be part of\nmost students\u2019 summer plans in 2012.\nIncidentally, despite all the proclaimed\nefforts at price reduction and special\nschemes for various parts of the popula-tion, as students we\u2019re going to have to\ncough up in full to get into any venues.\nAnd most finals or medal ceremonies\nstart at, you guessed it, \u00a350.\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, though. The\nballot system put in place by Lord Coe\nmeans that obtaining a ticket will not depend on your internet speed or willingness to queue (and it\u2019s all about fair play\nin the first place, isn\u2019t it?)\nAs I mentioned before, there are twen-ty-six sports being played at the next\nOlympics. While the big draws such as\nathletics and cycling will be difficult to\nget a seat for (not to mention pricey),\nthe other 23 disciplines are no less ex-citing. The athletes are just as passion-ate, and in many cases have a tougher\ntime of getting to the Games. However,\ndue to lower public interest seats will\nbe cheaper and easier to acquire \u2013 sud-denly, watching canoeing or shooting\nbecomes a no\u2013brainer.\nAs a fencer I feel very strongly about\nthis; many sports only come into the\nspotlight every four years despite the\nfact that they could appeal to a much\nwider audience. This is where university (especially Imperial) comes in\nhandy. Considering the absolute mountain of clubs and societies we have, I\u2019m\nsure you could find one for any Olympic\nsport (and if not, look into it and start\none yourself!). Try something you\u2019d\nonly ever seen on TV one summer. I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ll enjoy it \u2013 and you\u2019ll be able\nto appreciate it being played at the highest level next year.\nI\u2019m incredibly excited about the\nOlympics coming to London, and sports\nfan or no, I think you should be too. For\ntwo weeks, our city is going to be the\ncentre of the world, and we get to witness some of the greatest feats of human\nachievement ever seen. Success stories,\nbitter heartbreak; it\u2019s going to be an immense spectacle from start to finish.\nFor my part, I\u2019m going to go to as much\nfencing as I can. Tickets start at twenty\nquid \u2013 why don\u2019t you come along?\nGive viewers a sporting chance\n\u201cMy position works\nbcause I don\u2019t\ndifferentiate; I simply\nhate everyone.\u201d\nDon\u2019t be afraid to\nask for help\nI can\u2019t stand intolerant people\nEverybody has a coping mecha-nism; a way to ensure their\nheads don\u2019t explode from\nstress, annoyance or the general tedium of life. My own takes\nthe form of cooking; every revision period you can guarantee\na minimum of 5 three-course\nmeals and a couple of home\nrecipe cakes.\nThe result of this habit is\nthat I tend to carry my stress\naround with me, though less\nin its \u201cemotional\u201d form and\nmore as a rapidly expanding\nwaistline.\nFor my friends, this method\nof de\u2013stressing seems weird.\nSarah, who I have known\nsince High School, turns her\nstress into jet fuel. \u201cIf I\u2019m not\nstressed, I\u2019m not working,\u201d she\nwould continually remind me.\nThe story is less true for two\nof my other friends from home.\nOne has become as close to\nan alcoholic recluse as anyone\nwho regularly attends lectures\ncan. The other found that pain\ndistracted her best, and still\nbears those scars today.\nAs you can imagine, I advocate no method I have mentioned as a way to cope. My\nown \u2013 stuffing your face with\nfatty food \u2013 is not a good way\nto stay healthy. Pretending that\nyou like stress inevitably fails (I\nstill recall Sarah throwing pottery at me) and drinking heavily can lead to a stage where\nits difficult to distinguish between \u201cjust a good time\u201d and\nalcoholic.\nWhat is often worse about\nstress and general welfare issues is that we hide behind\nthis fog of \u201ceverything is ok\u201d or\n\u201cI\u2019m OK on my own.\u201d Though\nit\u2019s not weak to ask for help,\npeople often perceive this to\nbe the case.\nAs the president of a Faculty\nUnion I often feel this is a flaw\nwe as students have. We are\nall happy to say that lecture X\nwas crap because lecturer Y\njust read the PowerPoint slides\nbut not to approach someone\nfor guidance and advice.\nIf you are one of the latter\npeople (and yes, sadly this is\na plug) do try to visit the RCSU\nWelfare Week across campus.\nAnd if that is a little too brave,\nemail your Faculty Welfare Officer, the relevant Sabb or your\nPersonal Tutor \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of\nsupport out there.\nScott Heath\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\n\u201cI can only hope the\nOlympic organisers\nactually get people\ninto the venue.\u201d\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

As the gala went on it was clear\nthat Imperial were in the hunt to reach\nthe BUCS final up in Loughborough,\nbrushing aside competition from other\nuniversities to be in a promising position\nhalfway through the afternoon.\nMore good swims followed the mid-gala interval, however the team nar-Swimmers in command\nof the situation\nrowly missed out on a position in the\nfinal to the University of London swimming team. This was particularly galling\ngiven that IC had been told that they\nhad reached the final, only for that to be\ntaken away due to errors in calculating\npoints.\nThe swim team soon brushed off this\ndisappointment on their way up to Sheffield to compete in the BUCS Long\ncourse national championships.\nIt was clear from the first day of the\ngala that the team were in good nick,\nwhen the men\u2019s freestyle relay team\nqualified for the B final, after which results only improved. Hayley Rigby narrowly missed out on a place in the 200m\nIM final, and had to settle for a reserve\nplace. A new addition to the squad Chris\nJones made an instant impact when he\nqualified easily for the final of the 50m\nbreastroke narrowly edging Florian\nBrock out of the \u201csituation\u201d.\nBoth men\u2019s and women\u2019s medley relay teams then went on to qualifiy for\ntheir respective B finals, on a day which\nwould be capped by Chris coming 5th\nin the 50m breastroke, and the men\u2019s\nfreestyle relay team of Chris, Niki Peric,\nJaime Gonzalez and Thomas Whitehead-Clarke smashing their time from\nthe previous day by 4 seconds to come\n2nd in the B final, leaving them 12th in\nthe country. The weekend was capped\non the Sunday with Maria Graney narrowly missing out on the final for the\n100m backstroke for reasons unknown,\nand a great performance from the girls\u2019\nmedley team in their final, again improving on their time thanks to a tactical\nmaster-stroke from Alex Charleson.\nAll in all a fantastic 2 weeks of swim-ming, and a suitable farewell gift to the\nswimming club coach Sergio Catania\nwho will be moving on after over 5 years\nwith the club. His enthusiasm on pool-side will be missed, but the club hope to\nbuild on the success that he has brought,\nand go from strength to strength in the\ncoming years.\nSnookering\nsuccess at the\nMidlands Cup\nOn the weekend 5th/6th February the\nICU Snooker team descended on Coventry for the annual pre-BUCS warm-up; the Midlands Cup Tournament.\nAfter an eventful journey in which one\nplayer missed the train, the team arrived\nwith high spirits. The 1st team consisted of experienced old heads whereas\nthe 2nd team composed of enthusiastic\nFreshers and 2nd years who had worked\ntheir way into the team.\nIndividual tournament matches were\nplayed on the Saturday, with the 1st and\n2nd teams being separated to enter the\nindividual championship and individual\ntrophy tournaments respectively. Both\nteams had mixed success and there were\nnotable performances from Nitesh Mehta who overwhelmed his opponent in\nthe first round with accurate potting and\nflawless safety. The individual tournament ended without an Imperial student\nprogressing beyond the 3rd round, however the team event was still to come.\nThe 1st and 2nd teams were once again\nentered into separate team tournaments.\nThe 1st team of Sam Dennis (Captain),\nHari Arora, Lawrence Wild, Bogdan\nCozmacuic and Grace Yip played some\nfantastic match snooker and finished\n4th in their group. Most notably Hari\nArora managed a draw against Cardiff\u2019s\nR.Taylor and from 25 points behind\nagainst Southampton\u2019s D. Jose.\nThe 2nd team of Nitesh Mehta (Cap-tain), Shyam Pankhania, Aaron Trowbridge and Paul Choong was one player\nlight. Consequently two random players competed in an extra frame in each\nmatch. Nitesh Mehta and Paul Choong\nendured tough matches and persevered\nto keep the Imperial 2nd\u2019s in the tournament at the close of play on Saturday. So\nfar results had not gone the teams\u2019 way,\nafter losing 6-4 against Cardiff 3rd\u2019s\nand Warwick 2nd\u2019s. In the final team\nmatch against Southampton 3rds, Aaron\nTrowbridge\u2019s persistence paid off and he\nobtained a well-earned draw in the first\nmatch. Unfortunately, Nitesh Mehta nor\nPaul Choong could secure a frame leaving Imperial 2nd\u2019s trailing 5-1. It was\ntime for Shyam Pankhania to step up to\nthe plate and give Imperial an unlikely\npath through to the knockout phase. The\nfirst frame started off with the Southampton player taking a 20 point lead,\nhowever with some fantastic safety play\nand astute snookering the frame went\ndown to the black. The Southampton\nplayer potted the long black, and went\non to win the next frame on the black.\nImperial\u2019s pride was at stake and Shyam\nPankhania earned a couple of chances\nin the final frame. He successfully converted these chances with breaks of 14\nand a career high break of 27, winning\nthe frame on the long black which had\neluded him throughout the tournament.\nThe high breaks table was dominated\nby a Cardiff player who made fourteen\nbreaks of over 30. Nevertheless the\nImperial 1st\u2019s had impressive breaks\nof their own with Lawrence Wild making 41 and 43, and Bogdan Cozmacuic\ncomplemented this with a 32.\nOverall the Tournament was successful and now the ICU Snooker teams\nswitch their minds to defending their\nBUCS Snooker Title in March.\nShyam Pankhania\n1st XV overrun Portsmouth\nDavid Wilson\nRugby Union\nImperial 1s 33 - 0 Portsmouth\nThe 1st XV travelled down to Portsmouth on Wednesday eager to maintain\ntheir challenge for promotion against a\nside that are extremely difficult to beat\nat home.\nThe match began with fly half James\nHayward rocked by three late hits by\nthe Portsmouth openside in sequential\nplays. Portsmouth\u2019s repeated ill discipline around the field allowed Imperial\nto capitalise on penalties through their\nsuperior line out and subsequent mauls.\nCharlie Esberger, Chris McGeough and\nEd Labinksi provided safe and secure\nline out options. The breakthrough came\nmid-way through the first half with a try\nfinished off by Louie Barnett after good\nwork in the tight from the forwards.\nHayward added the conversion and a\npenalty before half time to give Imperial\na respectable lead at the turn around given that Imperial had defended for most\nof the first half, leading by example was\nreturning captain Caolan Cotter.\nFollowing the restart, Imperial carried\non where they left off, man of the match\nGeorge Lane and his centre partner Ben\nAdubi looked comfortable in attack\nand defence whilst Joe Harris and Jack\nNewton on the wings threatened when\ngiven the opportunity. Hayward added\nanother penalty before Toby Spittle, on\nfor Jamie \u2018S&M\u2019Aldridge, charged over\nfor a second try after good vision from\nreplacement scrum half Olly Cox, who\nreplaced the ineffectual Graeme Riddler.\nThe third try was simply a collective effort from the front row. Simon Fenton\nstole an overthrown lineout and charged\ninto the opposition 22 before offload-ing to Spittle who had the vision to see\nhooker, David Wilson, rampaging down\nthe touchline to score in the corner. Hayward added the conversion to end the\nday with a perfect kicking record.\nImperial hope to carry such intensity\ninto their remaining games this season.\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

Research from\nthe University of British Columbia has shown that\nfitties, as well as being noticed more than their\nplainer friends, are seen as more open, conscientious and agreeable. Researchers observed 75\nconversations between men and women, making\nthe participants rate their conversation partners on\na number of traits. So if you find yourself alone at\nthe next houseparty, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not becuase\nyou\u2019ve got a lame personality, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve\ngot an unattractive face!\nThis hoax dates back to the mid 90\u2019s when reports\nin the UK emerged that a Hungarian Scientist had invented a condom which would play music when put\non. The stories reported that one song selected for\nthe condoms was \u2018Arise, Ye Worker\u2019 (a communist\nhymn). Despite their best efforts no one was ever\nable to find Ferenc Kovacs and his lyrical inventions.\nThe same occurred almost a decade later when reports surfaced that Ukranian Dr Grigorii Chausovskii\nhad produced condoms with \u2018sensors\u2019 that would alter the music they played depending on the wearer\u2019s\nposition. Again it turned out to be nothing more than\na hoax with Dr Chausovskii and his invention impossible to track down.\nBen Good\nThea Cunningham\nHow did the seahorse get its shape? According\nto a new study published in Nature Communications, the tiny critters\u2019 horse-like bodies\nevolved to help them capture prey large distances away from their beady eyes.\nSeahorses, so-called because their bent head,\ncurved neck and long snout resemble our equine\nfriends, evolved from pipefish, which have\nstraight, pencil-like bodies. Both seahorses and\npipefish are part of the syngnathid family of\nfishes, which feast on small shrimps and larval\nfishes and are all equipped with large tendons\nthat enable speedy head and neck movements.\nUnlike pipefish, which swim towards their prey,\nseahorses dine by a process known as pivot\nfeeding, where the recoil of these tendons allows their head to move rapidly upwards and\ndraw the prey into their snout using suction.\nIt\u2019s been suggested the evolution of seahorses\nfrom pipefish was somehow related to changes\nin seagrass habitats or the creature\u2019s behaviour\ntowards hunting for food, but until now it\u2019s not\nbeen understood how the straight and narrow\nbodies of pipefish evolved into the S-shaped\nstructure seen in seahorses today.\nTo investigate, Sam Van Wassenbergh at the\nUniversity of Antwerp and colleagues developed mathematical models to simulate head rotation in both fishes. By gradually adjusting the\nposture of the head and trunk, they transformed\nthe pipefish model into a seahorse-like shape.\nWhilst doing so, the team discovered the strike\ndistance (the distance between the eyes that see\nthe passing prey and the final position of the\nmouth that catches it) increased considerably.\nMotion measurements recorded by the group\nrevealed a curved trunk enables the seahorse to\nstrike at prey further away compared to pipe-fish. An increased strike distance is particularly\nuseful for seahorses, who spend more than\n80% of their time glued to seagrass or fellow\nseahorses, and adopt a \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 feeding\nstrategy, where they sit tight whilst scanning\nthe water for tasty-looking prey.\nThe team propose this difference in foraging behaviour is linked to selective pressures\non strike distance, which caused the sharp head\nand trunk angle seen in seahorses to evolve.\nBecause seahorses are weak swimmers, evolving an S-shaped body increased the volume\nof water in which they could probe for prey,\nwhilst allowing them to cling on tight and\nlunge forward. This sit-and-wait feasting method is likely to have evolved before selection\nfor increased strike distance through a curved\ntrunk in the common ancestor.\nRead the original journal article:\ndoi:10.1038/ncomms1168\nOne of my most pleasant discoveries since arriving at Imperial has been the amazing science\nfiction library. For a small membership fee anybody can borrow items from its vast collection\nof over 9000 books and 1800 DVDs. It\u2019s allowed me to see brilliant films, such as Donnie\nDarko, and TV shows such as Firefly and, most\nrecently, Babylon 5.\nNever reaching the widespread recognition\nof Star Trek it nevertheless has a well-deserved\nreputation in science fiction circles as one of the\nbest television shows of the genre. It focuses on\nthe space station Babylon 5, built by humanity\nin the aftermath of the deadly Minbari War as\nan attempt to foster peace throughout the gal-axy. In the first four seasons the station\u2019s crew\nhave to face the re-emergence of an ancient\nevil, the Shadows, and a corrupt government\nback at home. Filled with political intrigue and\nmoral dilemmas, I can safely say that there was\nnothing like Babylon 5 on TV until the new\nBattlestar Galactica came out.\nThat\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t have its faults.\nThe show consistently aimed its attempts at humour at the lowest common denominator, often\nresulting in their abject failure in a show with\nso serious a tone. The deeply moving episode\n\u2018Day of the Dead\u2019, where many of the characters saw visions of their dead friends and en-emies, was almost completely spoiled by the\nappearance of the comedians Rebo and Zooty,\nplayed by Penn and Teller. They were made out\nto be sharp political satirists and the greatest\ncomic minds of their generation but turned out\nto be a lame Laurel and Hardy style double act.\nWhen almost the entire cast burst out laughing\nat their antics near the beginning of the episode\nI began to worry that there was a gas leak on\nthe station.\nThe show is also quite dull and slow-paced at\nits beginning. While most people say it picks up\nin its second season, for me it only reached its\ntrue potential in the brilliant season three episode \u2018Messages from Earth\u2019 when the conflict\nwith Earth begins in earnest. This was always\nmy favourite storyline, as government corruption is easier to relate to than giant cosmic evil.\nI hope that these comments don\u2019t put you off.\nI am, in fact, only stalling for time as I simply\ncannot find words to describe how good this\nshow can be. I even enjoyed season five, which\ngot a mixed reception from the fans.\nIf you watch no other science fiction, watch\nBabylon 5. At its worst it\u2019s still as good as a\nmediocre Star Trek episode and at its best its\nHugo-award-winning good.\nSee horse, that\u2019s how you got your shape, you silly little horse\nSeahorse race to equine finish line\nBY THE\nRIVERS OF\nBABYLON 5\nMaciej Matuszewski\non political corruption,\ngiant cosmic evils and\nlibraries\nMathemetical model demonstrates an upright advantage\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "My first experience with Music Tech Society resulted in internal haemorrhaging. I was\na fresher and just arrived at uni after a particularly interesting summer. It was Friday of\nFresher\u2019s Week and Music Tech were doing a\nnight at dB\u2019s (as it was still called then). This\nwas also my first exposure to dubstep, a vis-ceral, primitive and funkin\u2019 groovy style of\ndance music which I had no idea about until\nthen. I had lost my friends somewhere in the\ncrowds of the Union but was drunk enough to\nkeep myself entertained so I proceeded to shelter myself in the smoke and lights of our club.\nThe next morning in the shower I noticed I had\na black blotch the size of a watch under my foot\n\u2013 the result of a night intoxicated on beer and\ngood music.\nIt\u2019s hard to find good dance music. Usually\nit\u2019s in small clubs on the other side of town or\nin other towns altogether. You certainly won\u2019t\nget any at Picadilly Circus. My summer had\nbeen filled with free techno parties in the parks\nof Brussels (Piknik Elektronik, Soir\u00e9e Gazon,\nTea Time...) and I was elated to find people at\nuni who shared similar tastes. Being a member\nof the society now, I may be somewhat biased\nin saying the Music Tech nights at the Union\nclub are probably the best ones we ever have;\nMUSIC\nFELIX\n28\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nAlbum of The Week\nYuck\nYuck\nFat Possum\n2011\nIt feels way too early to start listening to 90\u2019s revival\nmusic. But then again, so many great bands like No\nAge, Male Bonding or Japandroids draw heavily on\nSub Pop and the Seattle grunge scene as a core inspiration for their music \u2013 albeit channeling the energy of 90\u2019s rock with modern experimentation. Yuck\ncan be seen as pertaining to the same bloodline\nas the aforementioned bands, but if you close your\neyes and listen to their self-titled debut throughout, I\nswear it\u2019s like travelling back in time. For me though\nit is even more interesting that this record is being\nreleased in 2011: Yuck have made an album full of\nnoisy pop songs, displaying a clear talent for writing\nhooks (see \u2018Holing Out\u2019), but they chose to intersperse these with beautifully-crafted acoustic songs.\nThe true quality of this album is not that it takes you\nback to another time, but rather that the music Yuck\nis crafting is timeless. The infectious nature of the\nsongs means that there is no use for modern tricks.\nJust down-to-earth, quality songwriting.

It\u2019s going to be FREAKING AWESOME and there is no excuse for not showing up. Entry is a mere \u00a33, and for that measly price\nyou get to watch eight (that\u2019s right, eight!) brilliant\nacts. We believe this is a great way to give some exposure to the great student musicians that Imperial\ntends to forget about. Three bands from Jazz n\u2019 Rock\nSociety (including Post-Indie Tech Punk headliners\nVetoes), four Music Tech acts (one of which is going\nto be an insane experimental electronic improvisation crew) and one special non-Imperial guest (the\ndevilish psych-pharaoh Raath-Mon-Tet) are gearing\nup to blow your collective minds. Greg Power\nA\nfter years of scouring through\nthe Necronomicon and the Dead\nSea Scrolls searching for proof\nof the existence of the mythical\nextraterrestrial pharaoh known\nas Raath-Mon-Tet, a friend suggested I should\nGoogle him.\nI had not thought of that. I guess I just did not\nexpect to find one of the most infamous evil\nspirits to ever rule the Galaxy on the friggin\u2019\nnet. But it turns out he does have a webpage.\nI\u2019ll be damned.\nI contacted the Nommon pharaoh RaathMon-Tet, harbinger of chaos, through his delightful \u201cAsk-A-Pharaoh\u201d page. Little did I\nknow that I had in fact unleashed a plague of\nbiblical proportions upon Imperial College, under the form of a psycore/experimental techno\nclosing set at Felix\u2019s Music Night, 19.02....\nWhat is Raath-Mon-Tet\u2019s story?\nSince possessing a boy of your species, RaathMon-Tet has had many attempts at enslaving\nthe human race using soundwaves. Notable attempts include a guerilla gig at your popular\nTrafalgar Square filmed on SkyArts, where the\n\u00fcber-death-psy magnifier unfortunately never\narrived, and the most recent of the heralded\nALAN nights (www.wearealan.com) where\nJoin in at: http://www.last.fm/group/Felix+Music\nMusic Tech bring the noise to 19.02\n1. James Blake\n2. Radiohead\n3. Kanye West\n4. Gorillaz\n5. Daft Punk\n6. Muse\n7. Arcade Fire\n8. Rihanna (????)\n9. David Bowie\n10. Caribou\nbut I\u2019ve thought that way ever since Fresher\u2019s,\nand until they get Squarepusher (Imperial\nMathematics alumnus?!) in, it will probably\nstay that way.\nSo much for the nocturnal frolicking. It\u2019s\nMonday evenings in the Union basement that\nreally make it what it is. That\u2019s when we get\ntogether and make music of our own. There\u2019s\nroom for the DJs as well as the producers and\nenough big and shiny equipment to make everyone feel like a kid in a candy shop. I myself am more of a maker than a player and\nthe wealth of production know-how which is\nbounced around during sessions is truly invalu-able. Sure we can sometimes geek out about\nLFOs, breaks and bass lines but then again\nwe\u2019re at Imperial aren\u2019t we? Better bass lines\nthan Bessel functions if you ask me... Oh and\nwhen sessions are over we get to listen to our\nown songs on the Metric sound system! If\nthat\u2019s not an eargasm, I don\u2019t know what is.\nFelix\u2019s 19.02 this Saturday will be the first\nMusic Tech performance in Metric since it\nopened earlier this year and I must say I am\n\u2018totally stoked\u2019 about bringing the good sounds\nout to the people. There will be two DJ sets and\none live improvisation which is a first for the\nsociety. To kick off the night, Algo Ritmico\n(host of IC Radio\u2019s experimental music broadcast The Big Racket!) will cook up a mixture\nof chilled psychedelia, infectious afrobeat\nand psychotropic vibrations to settle everyone in nice and cozy. After all the bands have\nbrought the funk (Eleven 37s), gone through\nthe blues (Tin Can 44s) and rocked it side to\nside (Vetoes), a back-to-back set from Chainz\nand Snatch DJs will shake things up with a\nmash-up of DIY tuneage, dubby steps and high\nvoltage electro. To explore the more abstract\ndimensions of live sound, three of our members have clustered together to form an as-yet-unnamed ensemble for a hazy concoction of\nimprovised electronic music, before the headliners kick out the jams.\nOn a more personal note, it\u2019s great to see Imperial\u2019s homegrown talent getting a bit of recognition on home turf. I\u2019ve never understood\nwhy the Union pays big money for BBC Radio\n1 DJs and \u2018hot butter\u2019 live acts when its own\nstudents could pull off a more eclectic and intimate affair by their own means. Surely getting\nthe students more involved in the events at the\nUnion would do away with the lingering apathy so many are so quick to mention. After all,\nit\u2019s called the Student Union for a reason.\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nBow before your alien\noverlord, puny Earthlings!\nAn exclusive interview with techno-deity Raath-Mon-Tet\nspirits channelled through a sacrificed alien\nalso failed to brainwash your kind.\nWhat does Raath-Mon-Tet want from us\npuny Earthlings?\nYour resources, your bodies and your minds,\nbut not your souls. Did anyone ever tell you\nearthlings that your souls taste like mayon-naise? Intergalactically speaking, smooth mayonnaise is the second worst tasting thing, only\njust falling behind chunky mayonnaise.\nWhy is Raath-Mon-Tet\u2019s music so goddamn\nloud?\nHave you ever tried to harness the willpower\nof an entire race during a DJ set? You need\nto crank your tunes pretty loud for the whole\nworld to hear them. Besides, listening to quiet\nmusic can seriously damage your credibility.\nWhat is Raath-Mon-Tet\u2019s favourite song to\nplay?\nThe Imperial March, Darth Vader\u2019s theme from\nStar Wars. The movie was good but Darth was\na much more fun guy in reality. The reason I\nmoved from that quadrant was because of the\nGungans. Man were those fellas irritating.\nIs your dream to perform on a giant floating\npyramid?\nRaath-Mon-Tet does not dream, Raath-MonTet does. And anyway, intergalactic arch-pharaohs regularly gig on collosal, crystalline\ntrapezohedrons. Why Raath-Mon-Tet would\nstoop to perform on pyramids is beyond RaathMon-Tet\u2019s understanding.\nAnd why in the world should people pay to\nsee some dude jump up and down in a pharaoh mask and poncho anyway??\nRaath blinks and interviewer falls to the ground\nunconscious.\nThis interview is adjourned! Raath-Mon-Tet\nwill sanctify Metric\u2019s sound system tomorrow\nnight! Don\u2019t miss it! Greg Power\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

Open to all levels whether they be black belts or white\nbelts, ICUTKD were joined with a few\nmembers from their sister club at Queen\nMary\u2019s to compete against other clubs\nfrom Britain, Belgium and Italy.\nThe competition is split into two\ntypes: patterns and sparring. Patterns\ninvolve the competitor performing a\nseries of movements set in a logical\nsequence in front of a group of judges\nwho would then score each individual\nperformance. Sparring involves a one-on-one fight against another opponent,\nwith points scored for each hit (though\nknockout is acceptable for senior\ngrades!).\nSparring categories are determined\nby weight and grade, however, during\nthe tournament many from ICUTKD\nwere moved up in weight categories to\nbalance out the numbers. Several found\nthemselves competing against opponents much larger than themselves,\nwhich made sparring an even tougher\nchallenge! Furthermore, whilst British\nrules state that sparring is semi-contact\nfor junior levels, rules in Italy declared\nthat sparring is full contact, regardless\nof level. This came as a shock to some\nmembers who only recently started\nTaeKwonDo and found out about the\nfull-contact rule in the morning of the\ncompetition. Despite all this, every\nmember embraced the challenge and\nfought hard. ICUTKD were able to\ncome away with a few medals, with\nCharles Heng Sok winning bronze\nmedals for both patterns and sparring,\nand Maija-Lisa Han winning the gold\nmedal for patterns and the bronze medal in sparring.\nIt\u2019s not all hard work and training at\nICUTKD though! With the tournament\nover, there was the chance to go sightseeing around Cagliari, a peaceful town\non the coast of Sardinia. With their average level in Italian being zero, the\nteam were still able to navigate themselves successfully through every nook\nand cranny of Cagliari. At the same\ntime, this provided a golden opportunity to take a peek at how the locals led\ntheir life.\nTo truly relish the Italian culture, the\nteam treated themselves to delicious\nItalian pizza, which was followed by a\ntrip to the local gelateria. In addition to\nthe wonderful food, we also managed\nto climb up a hill overlooking the town\nand saw a magnificent night view of Cagliari.\nFinally, on the way back to the airport\nin the rented cars we faced some, let\u2019s\nsay \u2018interesting\u2019, Italian driving whilst\ndoing our best at dodging the speed\ncameras (we were running a bit late!).\nThe challenges we faced were never\nending as we struggled to find a petrol\nstation that would accept a foreign credit\ncard.\nWithout a doubt, the tournament was\nan incredibly valuable experience and\na great deal of fun.

You didn\u2019t nod. I don\u2019t care if\nyou\u2019re in the library reading this with a\nfriend opposite you. I bet you still take a\nfew glances at the girl over there when\nyou think no one notices. They do, and\nit\u2019s a bit creepy. She wants you to stop,\nas she has to pretend to be very interested in her food to avoid eye contact.\nSee, that\u2019s how embarrassed you are,\nyou forced me off topic to try to avoid\nthe shame. Back to the question posed,\nnod if you are. Yeah I thought so, you\u2019re\nnodding aren\u2019t you. This is a universal\ntruth it seems. It\u2019s like Newton\u2019s three\nlaws but a fuck of a lot more fundamen-tal. I bet you do all the tricks. Only get\nthem free from the health centre \u2013 although even then you feel uneasy, but\ndon\u2019t worry you can just put down a\nfriends name. When you buy them you\ngo and put a whole bunch of other crap\nin with it don\u2019t you. \u2018Hey person working at Sainsbury\u2019s I\u2019m here to buy some\nitems. I\u2019m here to get 3 bottles of wa-ter, 4 snickers and a pack of crisps. Oh\ncondoms, ooops, well I guess I\u2019ll just\nhave to pay for them as well.\u2019 Doesn\u2019t\nwork at all. In this case homeopathy is\ncorrect. The more you try and dilute the\ncondoms, the more powerful it becomes\nwhen the real reason for this shop is\nrevealed.\nIt is a minefield though. No matter\nwhat you do it could have negative con-notations. Here is a quick run through:\nNormal \u2013 you\u2019re boring.\nFlavoured \u2013 well it\u2019s not the subtlest\nway to ask for a blow is it.\nThick \u2013 you either need the padding\nor maybe you need the desensitising\n(apparently it has that effect).\nThin \u2013 you are selfish.\nRibbed \u2013 you need a little extra help.\nExtra large \u2013 No-one\u2019s convinced...\nI would also like to say to the man looking at the various types of condoms of\noffer. When someone walks by don\u2019t\npick up the extra large in a showy\nway and make off as if to go and pay\nfor them. You are not fooling anyone.\nEveryone in the shop is a stranger. For\narguments\u2019 sake let\u2019s say the best-case\nscenario happens. A woman sees you\ngetting extra large and is instantly in-fatuated. She immediately drags you\nhome for passionate ecstasy. Then all is\nrevealed and you end up getting nothing but laughed at while looking like a\nfrankfurter in a parachute.\nMen hate this certain purchase so\nmuch that we have invented, and made\nFELIX\n38\nwillyoujoinmymiliband?\nHEY GUYZ! :P!!!!!

Let me reiterate\nwhy they are embarrassed. They don\u2019t\nwant to be seen buying something that\nimplies they are about to have sex in the\nnear future. Men don\u2019t want people to\nthink they are having sex. Yeah. Men.\nYou know, that gender that is world renowned for its hard earned reputation of\nmodesty about sexual prowess. The gender that hates bragging about any sexual\nconquests. I bet if I asked you right now\n\u201cWhy are you embarrassed about buying condoms,\u201d your reply wouldn\u2019t be\n\u201cWell you know, I wouldn\u2019t want people\nto think I\u2019m getting laid.

She is still, possibly, lying next to\nhim. The next part of the song describing his actions goes as follows:\nCam\u2019ron: Now I\u2019m flipping the cell,\nthat\u2019s right, I had to call up L. Yo L.\nL: What up?\nCam\u2019ron: I hit.\nL: What else?\nCam\u2019ron: Plus dome.\nL: Say word.\nCam\u2019ron: (Breaks out into song)\nAnd we got it on tonight.\nSee, his first reaction was to tell someone about it. Ignoring the fact that it\u2019s a\nbit lame to do that, you can see he wants\npeople to know. Although it is likely that\nhe misrepresented that conversation a\nbit. I bet it really went like this:\nCam\u2019ron: \u201cYo L \u2026 L! I HAD SEX!\nLIKE 30 SECONDS AGO! IT WAS\nAWESOME!\u201d\nL: \u201cIt\u2019s 3 in the fucking morning you\nfucking arsehole. Stop calling me every\ntime you get some. If you don\u2019t I\u2019ll stop\nbuying those condoms you can\u2019t psyche\nyourself up to buy.\u201d\nI\u2019m not like most guys. I relish the op-portunity. I\u2019ll tell you the scene I want to\ntake place. I walk in and stride over to\nthe condoms. Pick up a pack and place\nit on the self checkout. A siren goes off.\n\u2018Man expecting to have sex in the near\nfuture detected,\u2019 is the announcement.\nThen smoke starts shooting out of the\nmachine. An awe inspiring power ballad plays as I swagger out, condoms in\npocket, ripping open my shirt to reveal\nthe iconic Superman \u2018S.\u2019 That\u2019s how I\nwant that shit to go down. Maybe you\ndisagree, I don\u2019t know.\nFriday 18 february 2011\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nFFS\nSexyOsama69\nWhat? is sammy preggers again?\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nno,i just fuckin hate conservatives\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\nyeah me too lol\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nTotally ruined my \u2018Big Society\u2019\nidea\nThe_Cleggomatortrontown <3\nyour \u2018Big Society\u2019 idea was just\nfascism\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nYeah!

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX 35\nIt\u2019s the Eye of the Tiger... but I don\u2019t need it\nFriday 18 february 2011\nI\ns Survivor\u2019s 80s classic \u2018Eye of\nthe Tiger\u2019 the sweatiest song of\nall time? Whilst Elvis can take\ncredit for millions of broken\nteenage hearts, and Barry White\nfor millions of unplanned children, Survivor can take pride in being responsible\nfor a sea of sweat lost by inspired gym-goers since Rocky III in 1982. Did you\never wonder why the Pacific Ocean only\nappears on maps made since the 1990s\n(maybe a lie)? Well, now you know\nwhere it came from.\nBut I don\u2019t need it. Before setting\noff to pump iron yesterday it was not\na Rocky training montage I watched to\nget me psyched, nor Al Pacino\u2019s Inches\nspeech, but the Deus Ex 3 trailer in all its\ncyber-badass glory. Thus, like the genius\nof logic I am, I can conclude this article\nearly, having demonstrated conclusively\nthat gaming is not an inherently lazy and\nfattening past time. Video gaming has a\nhuge cast of heroes, its hulking space-marines and lithe ninjas that inspire my\nfitness hits as much as anything else.\nWait, you find it weird to use these\nfake folk as examples? But is it any\nstranger than actors strapping on fake-ab-packs and smearing on body grease\nfor 300\u2019s phoney Spartan army? Or the\ndroves of people who signed up to martial arts classes after witnessing The Matrix\u2019s fantastical fighting? Or a teenage\ngirl\u2019s neurotic comparisons to touched-up fashion photography? It\u2019s just psy-chology, yo, the power of exaggerating\nthe normal. Reach for the moon and all\nthat. Check out Cammy\u2019s abs in Street\nFighter and feel your flabby belly curl\ninwards in shame.\nTalking of which, she has fairly impressive tricep definition as well, though\nnot as ripped as Ryu\u2019s when busting out\none of his spectacular hadokens. In fact,\nI would go so far as to say that one of\nthe main draws of Street Fighter is its\ndepiction of the fighters; the fluidity of\ntheir animation and heft of their impacts.\nIn its over-the-top, fantastical way it is a\nspectacular celebration of human movement and physique, and the one-on-one\ndrama of fighting sports.\nSo there, I\u2019m done. Point proven. I\nmight as well fill the rest of the column\nspace with pictures of my own insanely\nchiselled abs.\nBut I can\u2019t really leave it at that\n(there\u2019s not enough space here to do\njustice to my abs for a start): Bulging\nbiceps, graceful animation, dynamic an-gles, swelling soundtracks, lean character design; these are all parts of gaming\u2019s\nmultimedia mongrel appeal but these\nthings aren\u2019t the exclusive territory of\ngaming, are they? And yet there is a dif-ference, that\u2019s for sure.\nSo I posit: There is no doubt that\nthose Rocky films, soaked in the visual\nparaphernalia of boxing, are a great cinematic homage to the sport. But in Street\nFighter we can feel the drama of split-second strategy changes and sudden\nbursts of action ourselves. After racking\nup an embarrassing amount of hours on\nlearning its depths and button-pressing\ncombos into my subconscious, I realise\nwhy people treat it as a sport unto itself.\nAnd now I think about it, that\u2019s sort of\nthe point. Deus Ex 3\u2019s trailer may get me\nhankering for some futuristic fisticuffs,\nbut the credit still goes to a video and\nnot the actual game. Street Fighter on\nthe other hand inspires me with its actual gameplay. And in being interactive,\nit does so in a different way, one at times\nmore seamless with my normal view on\nthe world.\nI am not of course saying that games\ncan replace real sports (yes fat man,\neven your Wii Fit), or vice-versa. They\nare both two discrete things, and Street\nFighter is more focussed on being Street\nFighter than any kind of real fight simu-lator. But gaming\u2019s interactive nature is\nunique amongst other forms of enter-tainment, and when I go to kick-boxing\nit is the hard-earned defence reflexes\nand attack combos of the game I am re-Guitar Hero comes to a timely demise\nOn February 9th, Activision announced\nthey were discontinuing the Guitar Hero\nfranchise, and as a result, their planned\n2011 Guitar Hero title was also can-celled. Activision cited \u201cdeclining interest in the music genre\u201d as their reason,\na phenomenon which is quite possibly\ndown to an almost completely saturated\nmarket.\nSince the release of Guitar Hero III:\nWarriors of Rock in 2007 (the first Guitar Hero game not to be developed by\nHarmonix \u2013 who now make competitor\nRock Band), the two franchises have\npublished 15 different titles between\nthem (excluding mobile versions and\nDJ Hero). This equates to more than\none release every three months on average \u2013 an astounding statistic. But each\nnew iteration generally offered little in\nterms of new functionality \u2013 instead, the\nmain purpose was just to add new songs\nfor the user to play. Add to that the hundreds of songs that can be bought from\neach franchise\u2019s online catalogue and it\nbecomes a distinct possibility that the\ngames start to compete with others from\ntheir own series.\nMaybe customers became dissatisfied\nwith having to splash out \u00a340 - \u00a350 on\neach new offering (plus the initial cost\nof the plastic peripherals), and decided\nto just stick to the games they already\nowned, topping up the songs they could\nplay with downloaded ones if they got\nbored. If this is indeed the case, then\nGuitar Hero was always going to suf-fer, as Rock Band has a far vaster downloadable content library. It could also be\npartially down to the ever-present recession \u2013 people\u2019s spending habits have\nchanged, and a new disc for 80 or so\nsongs doesn\u2019t make the cut.\nSo what does this mean for the future\nof the music game market? It\u2019s definitely a shame straight from the off \u2013 I\u2019ve\nbeen a big fan of the genre since Guitar\nHero III, and I\u2019m disappointed to see the\nseries go. But in the long run, it\u2019s possible that this announcement may have a\nbigger impact than it at first seems.\nThere has never been a clear cut \u201cbetter\u201d game between the two series, and\nthis required both developers to work\nhard on new features that would encourage gamers to buy their product over\ntheir rival\u2019s. This, like any healthy com-petition, was advantageous for the con-sumer, as they were always getting the\nbest deal for their money \u2013 if either company got complacent with their game\nthey would lose out on sales. Now that\nGuitar Hero is gone, Rock Band has noone to push them to constantly improve\ntheir games, and make sure they sign the\nright deals to get the best songs, which\nmay end up as detrimental to us players.\nThe future of Rock Band has also\nseemed a bit murky recently, with\nViacom (the owner of published MTV\nGames) selling Harmonix for the\nprincely sum of fifty dollars. However,\nHarmonix have assured gamers that this\nwon\u2019t affect them.\nWhatever the result, it\u2019s a sad day for\nfans of the series everywhere.\nChris Bowers\nminded of, more than any Karate Kid or\nOng-Bak.\nBecause most of all, gaming\u2019s interactivity makes it infectious. It keeps a\nhold on my mind long after the console\nhas been turned off. It can transform my\ntext-books into Tetris bricks and rubbish skips into potential hiding places\n(in case the guards see me, innit). Others use headphones to pump out their\nEye of the Tiger and add a baseline of\ncinematic drama to their life. I, with my\npoor game-addled mind, instead activate a sort of game-world visor at will,\ntransforming my view like some mental\n\u2018Lens of Truth\u2019. It is my personal level\nup to pump up my muscles and push\nthrough pain. Whether music or my\ngame-o-vision, rousing speeches or courageous quotes, they\u2019re all just illusions\nof entertainment we use to simplify the\nworld and maximise our effect, sporting\nor otherwise; our very own media-made\nand steroid-free performance enhancing\nproducts.\nSo maybe you want to call me a geek\nfor taking the whole thing so seriously,\nfor running that little faster when I go\npast a bus like it was some hulking co-lossus, or climbing bollards as if in some\ncut-price Mirror\u2019s Edge.\nGo on, call me a geek. But if you do,\nI\u2019ll Shoryuken your ass.\nDo you know how Omar Hafeez-Bore got those abs? By playing video games!\n\u201cIt is my personal\nlevel up to pump up\nmy muscles and push\nthrough pain\u201d\nDamn, now I can\u2019t even be an armchair rockstar\n\n"

It sucks, but it is an intrinsic part\nof Mother Nature\u2019s menstrual cycle.Yeah\nI know it hurts because it turns out that\nchick you liked is actually a total slag.\nAnd that guy you thought was giving you\nthe eye? He happens to be a sex offender.\nLife is full of dissapointment, so you better get used to it. What the hell did you\nthink they invented whiskey for anyway?\nBut when you\u2019re right at the bottom of\nyour cesspool of despair, Tin Can 44s are\nthere to pull you out, give you a kind slap\nacross the face and drag you along for a\nnight out on Kingly Street.\nI spoke to two of the Tin Cans about\nwhat the Blues means to them, musical\nauthenticity and what they\u2019ll bring to the\nparty tomorrow, when they play Felix\u2019s\nMusic Night, 19.02.\nWould you like to introduce your-selves?\nPhil (guitar, vocals): Wait. What if I introduce him, he can introduce me.\nSounds like a plan.\nPhil: Ok, this here\u2019s the Big Shot. He\nplays percussion for us, and tends to rearrange pretty much anything we intend\non doing, pretty much how he wants to\ndo it right then and we all need to hold\non tight.\nAaron (drums): This is Phil. \u201cThe Power\u201d. \u201cTaylor\u201d. Nah, it\u2019s just Phil. Plays\nguitar, vocals in The Tin Can 44s, which\nis who we are.\nPhil: There was supposed to be someone\nelse here. Boxcar Joe. Plays harmonica\nfor us. He\u2019s an actor and creator. Well\u2026\nhe calls himself that, so it\u2019s not as omnipotent as he thinks but\u2026 Yeah, he\nplays harmonica for us. And fills in any\nof the gaps on the Delta lyrics that we\u2019ve\nforgotten. That\u2019s us at the minute. And\nwe\u2019re going through bassists at a pace.\nUmm. Having to replace them far too\nregularly.\nTin Cans talkin\u2019 Blues\nImperial\u2019s badass Blues barons Tin Can 44s give us some straight\njive talk, promising to push your tushie into full swing at 19.02\nDid you guys start out with blues covers and then move towards your own\nsongs?\nPhil: I always had my own songs that\nI always wanted to play, and I used to\nwrite them faster than we would get\nthem recorded or get them rehearsed\nproperly. Immediately when we started\nplaying we found that we needed to play\ngigs now, and the kind of joints that we\nwanted to play require you to have a\nplaybook. You have to be able to play\na certain number of standards and not\nsound like an idiot.\nAaron: I think we did start off with doing Blues standards and covers, but now\nwe are writing more original material\nand playing that more so instead of the\nfocus before being: \u201cwe\u2019ll try an original\nsong interspersed within the set\u201d, now\nit\u2019s more like we\u2019ll play our own stuff\nand then at the end we\u2019ll do a standard\nthere that everyone knows and loves.\nAnd I think that\u2019s what we enjoy more.\nBecause it\u2019s hella fun to play the blues\nbut it\u2019s also much more satisfying and\nenjoyable to write your own stuff which\nis still inspired by the same sort of thing.\nPhil: I found we needed to do what was\neffectively the Blues \u2013 but a bit more. Because a lot of the original sounds, original structures, they\u2019ve been hammered\nout pretty thin by the original guys, who\ncould run rings around me certainly.\nSo we needed to do something that\nwas a bit more \u2013 necessarily original.\nBecause it just wouldn\u2019t be authentic re-ally, I can\u2019t sing about the Delta, or my\nwoman dying, or the flood in Tupelo. I\nwasn\u2019t there!\nWhere do you get your inspiration?\nPhil: To set out writing a blues is really\nforced. Because the process by which\nthe blues were written were from work\nsongs from call-and-reply tunes that\nwere sung even without any music. The\npercussion was breaking rocks with a\npick-axe, and a sawblade and a train.\nThat\u2019s what you had to work with.\nSo it would be a call and reply: there\nwould just be the biggest loudest guy\nstanding there a little bit up on a hill, and\neveryone would just shout the line back\nto him, and you get some repetition and\nnatural harmonies and things like that.\nThat\u2019s a very organic way of doing it.\nSo if I was to sit down and go: \u201cOK,\nthat\u2019s a line, and I\u2019m gonna do that\ntwice, and then I\u2019m gonna go up to the\ndominant chord, and then come back\ndown\u2026\u201d No man. Nobody\u2019s gonna buy\nthat. You can see all these people who\nare going through the motions.\nAaron: I do listen to the blues, obvi-ously, but my background musically is\na lot more kind of abstract and very sort\nof progressive, kind of music. So Phil\ncan bring stuff in and I\u2019ll completely\nchange it. Flip everything round. But\nwe still listen to all those great blues\nsongs and I think that\u2019s hopefully what\ncomes through in our playing. Just because we\u2019re not doing a standard 12-bar\nor something, you know the themes that\nwe\u2019re bringing up, and the way we play,\nand the feeling we put into it, hopefully\nall of that\u2019s still there.\nPhil: I mean certainly the great thing\nabout the three of us \u2013 Boxcar Joe included \u2013 is that what the three of us do\ntogether, no one of us could have made\nup on their own. Boxcar Joe writes his\nown stuff, that he doesn\u2019t bring to our\nband because he thinks he\u2019s just gonna\nmix up the vibe. He writes dirty sea\nshanties about big-leg women and, uh\u2026\nsailing. He sings that with his harmonica\nframe on and his guitar.\nAaron\u2019s there listening to some progressive shit, in some time signature \u2013\nlike 9/11 time signature or something.\nSo when I give these guys a song I could\nget it back in any old way, I have no idea,\nI can\u2019t predict it. Certainly I write all my\nstuff acoustic. But then when it\u2019s gone\nthrough the Tin Can factory, it comes\nout a completely different animal.\nWhat does the Blues mean to you?\nAaron: The Blues is when you ain\u2019t\ngot no money to pay yo house rent, cuz\nyou\u2019re thinkin evil.\nPhil: When you come in your front door,\nyou hear your backdoor slam. You\u2019re\nthinking evil.\nAaron: On a serious note, everyone feels\nshit during their life at certain points,\nmaybe for crap reasons or not. Whatever. Everyone feels down. And the blues\nis just a celebration of that, laughing instead of crying, and just a great way to\nlet it out and feel good. And it\u2019s just a\nreally enjoyable experience for me.\nPhil: The Blues isn\u2019t about moping in\nthe corner. The Blues is about sitting\non your housetop shirtless with a half-bottle of rye, shouting at the neighbour,\nbecause he done stole your woman. It\u2019s\nthat kind of stuff. There\u2019s certainly a lot\nof commaraderie in it. When you see\nbluesmen talk to each other it\u2019s something different. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve got a\nsecret story. That only they know. Only\nthey know the plot, or only they know\nthe scene. And they can change the\nscripts how they want. It\u2019s this kind of\nsecrecy, it\u2019s like a little club. It\u2019s a secret handshake, it\u2019s that kind of music.\nThat\u2019s what the Blues is: mythology.\nWhat will you guys bring to 19.02?\nAaron: People will be fucking dancing\nwhen we\u2019re playing our tunes.\nPhil: If people aren\u2019t dancing, I\u2019ll eat\nmy hat. And I think people will see\nthat when we play a song, it\u2019s that one\ntime we played that song. It wasn\u2019t that\nwe\u2019ve written beat by beat, bar by bar\nhow it goes.\nAaron: That\u2019s the only time you\u2019ll hear\nthe song that way.\nPhil: The themes are the same, plot\u2019s the\nsame, characters are the same but the\nscene has changed. That\u2019s what you get:\na one time experience.\nGreg Power\nIf you want to share a\nmind-blowing playlist send\nit in to\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nTin Can 44s tearing into another blast of blues, minutes before they raided a liquor store and drank all the rye\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nfelix\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nVeronika McQuadeova\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nStargate SG-1:Alove story\nT\nhe first science fiction television\nshow I ever saw and the series\nthat got me interested in the entire genre was Stargate SG-1, the\nfollow-up to Roland Emmerich\u2019s\nforgettable 1994 film.\nThe film followed the US military discovering how to operate the Stargate, an ancient\ndevice which allows instantaneous transportation between planets, which was discovered\nseveral decades earlier, buried in Egypt. The\nTV series picks up this story, with the unearthing of the Gate allowing the Goa\u2019uld, an evil\nalien race which ruled Earth thousands of years\nago under the assumed identities of various\ncivilizations\u2019 deities, to rediscover the planet.\nThe military therefore sets up a number of \u2018SG\nteams\u2019 to go on missions through the Stargate\nto find means of defending against the enemy.\nThe show follows the exploits of SG-1, led by\nColonel Jack O\u2019Neil (Richard Dean Anderson)\nand consisting of polymath scientist Captain\nSamantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), archaeologist Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and\nTeal\u2019c (Christopher Judge), a defector from the\nGoa\u2019uld armies.\nAt first glance there seems to be little to\npraise in this series. Most villains are entirely\ntwo dimensional, everyone on alien planets\nseems to speak English and the heroes defeat\ntwo evil alien races introduced later on in the\nseries by genocide, the moral implications of\nwhich are not even touched upon. These prob-lems, however, are nothing compared to the\nshow\u2019s strengths.\nThe main characters are some of the best I\u2019ve\never seen on television. I can relate to all of\nthem in one way or another and all are both\nlikable and show some depth. My favourite\nmust be Colonel O\u2019Neill, a deeply professional\nyet light-hearted man who conceals the trauma\nof his past military experience and of his son\ndying after accidentally shooting himself with\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s gun. He is the show\u2019s main source of\nhumour, its unique selling point. It is always\npresent, with O\u2019Neill ready to point out how\nclich\u00e9d the villains\u2019 actions are, no matter how\ndesperate the situation, yet it is never over-played. The show only devolves into outright\ncomedy in its 200th special episode, with the\nshow\u2019s creators being careful not to allow it to\novershadow the drama at other times.\nThe overall story is somewhat weaker and\nless detailed than that of shows like Babylon 5\nor the new Battlestar Galactica. It is far \u2018lighter\u2019, and you can watch an episode just for the\nsense of adventure as the main characters explore a planet. This is not to say that Stargate\u2019s\nplot is bad: the characters take a long time to\ndefeat the technologically superior Goa\u2019uld\nand their other enemies and do so in a logical\nway. There are also very few of the deus-ex-machina endings of the type seen so often on\nStar Trek.\nWhat We Watched...\nGive it up for the \u2018Easy Crew\u2019\u2013- \u201cder to make de bad\ntings good\u201d \u2013 Rastamouse, Scratchy and Zooma in\nCBeebies\u2019 new series titled Rastamouse. The show\nseems to be popular with adults too, with the widely\nheld theory that \u2018cheese\u2019 actually means \u2018marijuana\u2019.\nRefreshingly, the mice are puppets in stop-motion,\nrather than CGI like the rest of children\u2019s TV these\ndays. It\u2019s a pity that their English grammar is akin to\nthat of an ill-educated rap-star, but the fact that they\nall sound like Lenny Henry more than makes up for it.\nIf you\u2019re really pissed and bored it\u2019ll be the funniest\nthing you\u2019ve seen since Susan Boyle.\nPresident Wensleydale (seemingly erroneously\ndressed as a policemouse \u2013 trouserless too of\ncourse) often enlists the help of the Easy Crew to get\nto the bottom of Grove Town\u2019s petty crimes, which\nare always punished with what seems to be community service rather than custodial sentences. The\nsubliminal message of all this is bound to create a\ngeneration of gangsta-speaking, car-stealing, no-trou-ser-wearing people who expect to say sorry and paint\nsome walls to atone for their crimes.\nColonel Jack O\u2019Neil: Wise-guy glower king\nTuesday Wednesday Thursday If you missed it...\nFriday Saturday Sunday Monday\nThe Beauty of Books\nThis episode features Illustrated\nbooks, for the simpler of you lot.\nBBC4, 8.30pm\nToughest place to be...\n...a bus driver.

The show\u2019s creators had thought\nthat it was going to be cancelled and so had given season eight a very satisfying ending which\ntied up most of its loose threads, with one of\nthe last episodes even being called \u201cThreads\u201d.\nRather than promoting the few unresolved minor plot elements to main plot status in when\nthey learned the show had been reprieved,\nthey introduced a new, even more powerful,\nadversary and even tried to shoehorn it into the\nexisting continuity. This felt completely contrived and, despite all that they had achieved,\nthe characters were essentially left back where\nthey had started: facing an immensely powerful enemy race with little chance of success.\nEven worse, this was also the time when Richard Dean Anderson decided to leave the show.\nThe remaining cast could probably have managed alone but it was decided instead to introduce Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell,\nplayed by Ben Browder. He was simply boring,\nwhich would have been tolerable if the writers\nhad not been trying so hard to make him fill\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s shoes. The comparison just helped to\nemphasise what the series had lost. Even worse\nhe took away attention, as well as the well deserved sole command of the team, from the far\nmore interesting Carter, who had herself risen\nto the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by this time.\nOn the other hand this was also the time when\nClaudia Black\u2019s Vala Mal Doran, who had appeared in one episode earlier on, joined the\nteam. She was the polar opposite of Mitchell:\nvery funny and, as a compulsive liar and ex-thief, a type of person we had never before\nhad on the team, with all the exciting possibilities that this entailed. Together with a few\ngreat episodes, such as \u201cBounty\u201d, and the still\nvery good remainder of the original SG-1, she\nhelped save the last two seasons.\nStargate SG-1 is far from the best science fiction show out there, especially its later episodes.\nIt is, however, one of the most fun shows, and a\nbrilliant introduction to the genre.\nWelcome to the TV-obsessed\nworld of James Simpson\nThis week\u2019s Hustle was particularly good, as the\nteam\u2019s con nearly falls apart when Ash twats his\nface and ends up in hospital, developing an unusual\ncondition which stops him telling lies (something of\na problem for a professional con-artist). Predictably\neverything works out when he twats himself for a\nsecond time and his lying ability is restored.\nThe first episode in the BBC\u2019s Toughest Place\nto be a... followed paramedic Angie Dymott as she\nspends two weeks in Guatemala City \u2013 probably one\nof the world\u2019s most violent places outside of Max Moseley\u2019s head. More used to dealing with old people\u2019s\nheart attacks and kitchen accidents, Angie struggles\nto keep her horrified reactions to herself at the sight\nof so many gang stabbings and shootings.\nIf like me, you stayed in and did nothing this Valentines\u2019 Day (sobs), you might have seen The Worst\nPlace to be Gay on BBC3. This rather odd documentary was presented by Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills who\ntravels to Uganda and meets, amongst others, the\nPreacher who thinks that homosexuality should be\npunished by the death penalty. Mills tries a witchdoctor\u2019s cure for homosexuality, which consists of\nhis partially naked self being wiped over with a wet\nchicken. After this ordeal, Mills proclaims that he\nfeels \u2018dirtier than before\u2019. We are also treated to a\nfew pearls of wisdom from the people on the street\n\u2013 \u201cI was asked to be gay once, I refused\u201d. I think he\nmay have misunderstood the concept slightly.\nIt\u2019s not hair, his head is actually that shape...\nFriday 18 february 2011\n32\n\n"

Manufacturing has already begun\nby many of the 14 firms that have subscribed to\nthe initiative, which will see a special charging\nport added to all devices manufactured from\nnow on.\nThis will help with the environmental impact\nof having over 51,000 tonnes of waste chargers\nproduced each year. The problem arises when\nconsumers purchase new mobile phones and\ndiscard their old chargers. Over 30 million mobiles are sold in the UK each year leading to a\nhuge amount of rubbish.\nHow often have we travelled somewhere and\nforgotten our charger and had to borrow one\nfrom a friend? Inevitably we can\u2019t find the correct charger and have to traipse around asking\nwhether someone at the office has the correct\ncharger. There are over 30 different chargers\non the market today which almost always results in waste and too many chargers in every\nhousehold!\nDid you know that since 1994 an estimated\n10 billion mobile phones have been sold world-wide? As of July 2010 we know that 5 billion\nare in current circulation. This easy maths\nmeans that around 5 billion mobile phones are\ndefunct and lying, buried amongst wires and\ndisused currency in our drawers, in our garages\nand in our attics. With all these handsets inevitably comes the paraphernalia associated with\nthem: packaging, boxes, instruction manuals\nand the obligatory chargers.\nUnfortunately the most costly of these to the\nenvironment is the charger. All the electronics,\nmanufacturing, transportation and electricity\ndrain adds up to huge amounts when multiplied\nby 10 billion. That is why in March 2009 the\nEU drew up a voluntary contract for all mobile\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Google Translate\nGoogle Translate has finally made it to iOS!

From the first generation\nthrough to the iPhone 4, Incipio has made\nsome of the best minimal cases money can\nbuy. So you could say Incipio\u2019s latest, the\nfeather for iPhone 4, has some big boots to fill.\nFeather by name, feather by nature \u2013 at less\nthan 1mm thick, it\u2019s certainly minimal. In fact\nit\u2019s the thinnest case I\u2019ve come across, and fits\nthe iPhone 4 exactly.The entire back is covered except for a hole for the camera lens and\nflash, while the side controls plus the top and\nbottom are exposed for easy access.\nThe case is made from a rigid, but soft-touch\nplastic, and clips onto the corners of the antenna band and along the sides, minus where\nthe volume controls are located. This means\nthat the glass screen sits about 1mm out from\nthe case edges, essentially leaving it totally ex-posed. It\u2019s a good thing then that Incipio have\nFeather-light protection for your iPhone 4\nSamuel Gibbs\nphone manufacturers within the 27 EU member states to subscribe to using a single charge\ndevice or the firms were to face mandatory EU\nlegislation. Unsurprisingly they opted for the\nvoluntary common standards option which left\nthe details open to negotiation. The voluntary\ncommon standards were henceforth known as\na Memorandum of Understanding and are confusingly referred to as the MoU.\nThe cross-company technology has been unveiled as the micro-USB (universal serial bus)\nconnector that is already in use with some of\nthe major handset manufacturers like Nokia,\nRIM (Blackberry) and Samsung. In total 14\nfirms have signed up for this voluntary contract\nincluding the giants of Apple, Motorola and\nSonyEricsson. This port traditionally allows\ndata transfer as well as power charging capabilities for handsets. Thus they will be able to\ncharge from wall sockets or computers.\nFortunately for Apple there is a loophole in\nthe standardisation contracts that states that the\ndevices don\u2019t have to have a mini-USB port\ndirectly on the machine. They can instead be\nadded by means of a converter. Apple make\na large portion of their profits from selling licenses to third party companies to develop peripherals to their devices. They will be able to\ncontinue doing this and it\u2019s likely they will ship\na small converter with their iPhones within the\ncoming months.\nThe next step, once these chargers have saturated the market, is to stop supplying the chargers with the mobile phones. This is likely to\nhappen inside of two years, thus removing any\nfurther manufacture of unneeded chargers. It is\nhoped in the future that this will spread to other\npersonal devices such as MP3 players, tablets,\ndigital cameras and laptops but no move by the\nEU has thus far been made.\nincluded two screen protectors in the box, but\nI can\u2019t help thinking the edges of the screen\nare a little too exposed.

He is under the watchful\neye of Janine, his scary grandmother who turns\na blind-eye to all of her sons\u2019 criminal activities\nwhilst she looks to gain as much benefit from\nthem as possible. She is financially sorted for\nlife, as long as her sons, who mostly obey her\nin ways no grown-up sons would ever do, keep\nbringing in the cash.\nAnimal Kingdom is not just a good \u201cAustralian\u201d film. It\u2019s an absolutely phenomenal crime\ndrama that is surely in league with similar\nthemed films that are considered great inAmeri-can cinema. The intimate family dynamic is\nlooked at with so much focus and tension that\nevery time a character even blinks, the audience\nis brought to the edge of their seats. Since several important characters have such volatile minds\nand vastly different goals, you have no idea just\nwhere this film will take you, and every interaction with key family members is absolutely crucial to the plot development. It\u2019s a compelling\nwatch, and superbly paced, with director David\nMich\u00f4d having the confidence to take his time\nin extending various scenes to create as much\nsuspense as possible. A lot of the scenes are qui-et, restrained, but hugely effective in building up\nthe gritty, morally corrupt underground network\nof criminals.\nIn portraying this great tragedy which chronicles the conflict and eventual fall of the proud\nfamily, the exceptional actors do an admirable\njob. Frencheville, in his debut performance,\nadds a surprising amount of layers and depth\nto his character. He\u2019s not someone to warm up\nto right away, since he is mostly very distant\nand awkward around the \u201cnew\u201d members of\nhis family but as events unfold and he travels\ndeeper into the criminal activities of this one\nfamily, his inner battle and wake of conscience\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done some bad things, haven\u2019t you\nsweetie?\u201d gently reminds the matriarch of the\nMelbourne-based Cody crime family. It\u2019s a moment of true wonder, as Janine \u201cSmurf\u201d Cody\n(Weaver) calmly manipulates her way into the\nminds of everyone around her without a flinch.\nShe casually smiles away, putting on that brave\nface, pretending nothing will ever go wrong in\nher life with her three criminal sons: Andrew\n\u201cPope\u201d Cody (Mendelsohn), Craig Cody (Sta-pleton), and Darren Cody (Ford).\nJoshua \u201cJ\u201d Cody\u2019s (Frencheville) mother was\nfar from perfect \u2013 but even she had enough sense\nin her to keep her only son away from her own\nmother and siblings who are constantly up to no\ngood and are in trouble with the law. But after\nshe dies of a heroin overdose, the 17 year-old J\nis left with no choice but to join the relatives he\nhasn\u2019t seen for a long time. The oldest, Andrew,\nis in hiding with ties to armed robbery, Craig is\ndealing drugs with a dirty cop, and Darren is doing whatever his brothers tell him to do. Over\nthe period of less than a single day, J has quite\nsuddenly been thrown into a world he knows\nvery little about.\nBlood is spilled and loyalties are tested. As\nLeckie (Pearce), a smart detective leading the\npolice investigation, starts closing in on the various members of the Cody family, the role of the\nnewcomer becomes that much more crucial. J\nis asked to steal a car to be used as a setup for\nmurdering two police officers. J\u2019s dedication to\nClassic Cinema\nBicycle Thieves\nA man searching for his bike hardly sounds like a\ngreat plot for one of the most beloved films of all\ntime, but Vittorio De Sica\u2019s 1948 masterpiece is a\nbeautifully crafted portrayal of suffering and poverty\nin post war Rome. Being the definitive Italian Neorealist film, Bicycle Thieves has all the anti-Hollywood\ntouches that made this genre so refreshing. The cast\nare all amateurs, the script largely improvised and\nthe whole film is shot on location.\nLamberto Maggiorani (a factory worker before being snagged by De Sica for the role of Antonio) plays\na typical down and out Roman, desperate for work,\nwho assembles every morning with his fellow unemployed begging for a job from a city official. Fortunately his run of bad luck is over and he gets a job putting\nup glossy film posters around town. However his bad\nluck soon returns after his bike is stolen on his first\nday of work. Accompanied by his plucky young son,\nhe spends the next day pounding the pavements\nsearching for the precious bike which his livelihood\ndepends on.\nThe beauty of this film is the relationship between\nAntionio and his son Bruno (A mesmerising performance by Enzo Staiola). Bruno idolises his father,\nregardless of his inability to provide for his family\nand over the course of the day the young boy learns\nthe invaluable lesson that life is simply unfair. In one\nscene, Antonio agonises over the hopelessness of\nhis situation and strikes his son but quickly jumps to\nconclusions after witnessing another person nearly\ndrown in the Tiber. But his relief after finding Bruno\nalive and well quickly dissipates upon realisation\nthat he is no closer to finding his bike. The social\ncommentary is not subtle, this is a Marxist parable\nafter all, however an exchange of glances between\nBruno and another child in a restaurant is remarkably charming.\nBeing a Realist film, there is predictably no happy\nending. Against all the odds, Antonio recognises\nhis bike and after tracing the thief to a brothel he\nfinds himself confronting the local gangsters. A local policeman admits he can\u2019t do anything and in\nabsolute dispair Antonio steals another bicycle but\nis caught straight away, Although his sympathetic\nvictim doesn\u2019t press charges, the damage has been\ndone and in the famous heartbreaking ending Antonio takes his distraught son home, his heroic opinion\nof his father shattered. Ed Knock\nIt\u2019s an absolutely\nphenomenal crime drama\nthat is surely in league\nwith similar themed films.\n\u201c\nthat\nence\nce\never-ver-minds\nminds\na just\na just\nerac-eracIt\u2019s an abs\nIt\u2019s an ab\nphenome\nphenome\n\u201d\ncrime drama\nrime drama\nn league\nn league\nemed films.\ned films.\nis shown subtly. Of the three criminal brothers,\nMeldelsohn, playing the eldest, gives the most\nfrightening performance. Something isn\u2019t quite\nright with this guy; he comes off as psychoti-cally detached and it is unsettling to see the brilliant Mendelsohn in so many scenes. But since\nhe is one of the major characters of the film,\nwe\u2019ll just have to settle with being afraid of him\nthroughout.\nThe true revelation here however, is Weaver,\nwho has been the talk of Hollywood for nabbing a surprise Oscar nomination. She shows\nher love can be limitless \u2013 when she decides\nto share it that is \u2013 but can also be taken away\nin a heart-beat, as soon as she senses imminent\ndanger or threat to her little empire. She is the\nmonstrous female in the background, pulling\nthe strings behind the scenes, so everything can\nwork to her advantage. Her words are piercing\nenough to get under your skin, but she delivers\nthem with such calmness that her detachment\nalone is enough to give you shivers.\nIt\u2019s encouraging to see something from Australia is getting its much-deserved international\nrecognition. It won\u2019t have a huge sales impact,\nbut for those of you seeking a taut, finely writ-ten, confident and brilliantly performed crime\ndrama, this is no doubt on the same standard as\nthe more flashy, high-budget U.S. thrillers.\nTuesday 22nd February\niCU Cinema \u2013 AGM & FILM TRIVIA PUB\nQUIZ 6PM \u2013 Free/\u00a31\nMegamind \u2013 \u00a33/4 (members/non-members)\nUnion Concert Hall, Beit Quad\nEVENTS\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

Both libraries will also be open as\nusual over the Royal Wedding weekend and May bank\nholiday weekend.\nThe change comes as Easter falls so late this year\nand hence during a critical revision period, catering\nfor the many trying to maximize hours spent in the\nlibrary.\nIn another new development for the library, on\nMonday the PC availability screens on Level 1 went\nlive.

Although it remains common\npractice to \u201csave\u201d computers with one\u2019s belongings\nwhilst away so the PC may not be as available as indi-cated, the information provided about where PCs and\nstudy rooms are available upon entering the library\nwill be infinitely useful.

The school\nwill focus on both teaching and, according to\nits director, Professor Elio Riboli, research\naimed at providing \u201cthe evidence that will help\nsocieties understand the causes of diseases and\nhow to prevent them\u201d. Visitors to the opening event, taking place in the Great Hall and\nfeaturing Health Secretary Andrew Lansley,\nwere, however, met by a group of over twenty\ndemonstrators, part of the \u2018Big Society NHS\u2019\ncampaign against the government\u2019s planned\nNHS reforms. Although they were not allowed\ninto the Sherfield building\u2019s entrance foyer, the\ngroup stood outside, handing out leaflets and\nshouting the slogans \u201cpublic health not private\nwealth\u201d and \u201cLansley, Lansley don\u2019t be a fool \u2013\nyou\u2019re making me quit medical school\u201d.\nBig Society NHS opposes Lansley\u2019s plans to\nabolish primary care trusts, transferring their\npowers to GPs, and allow more competition\nbetween different health service providers, including the private sector. While the protesters\nadmitted that \u201cGPs should have a larger say\u201d\nin the care of patients they were adamant that\nthis was not the right way to achieve this. Their\nliterature points out that \u201cover half of GPs\ndon\u2019t want this responsibility\u201d. Indeed, a recent\nRoyal College of GPs survey found that only\n21.5% agreed with Lansley\u2019s reforms.\nJames Chan, a foundation year one doctor,\nsaid the plan would allow the \u201cprivate sector\n[to] undercut\u201d the NHS, leading to its \u201cfragmentation\u201d. He argued that the \u201cbest doctors\n[would be] attracted to better paying private\nhealthcare\u201d which will be \u201cfocused in rich\nareas\u201d leading to \u201cbudget healthcare\u201d for the\npoor. He said that in his experience \u201ccooperation\u201d, rather than the financial competition supported by the coalition, \u201cleads to better healthcare\u201d. A number of the protests\u2019 organisers\nissued a joint statement saying that they were\n\u201copposed to the new health and social care bill\nwhich signified a moving away from the NHS\u2019\nfounding principle\u201d. They said that if the bill\nwas passed the health service would \u201cno longer\n[act] in the best interest of the people[ but in the\ninterest of] profit\u201d instead.\nThe group was also keen to stress how they believed that the Conservatives were not impartial\nin this issue. They pointed out how, since 2006,\nthe party has received \u00a3107,000 in donations\nfrom the family of the CEO of the private health\ncompany Care UK, with Lansley personally receiving a separate \u00a321,000 from the company.\nThey accused the party of serious misconduct\nin afterwards awarding the company with a \u00a353\nmillion prison healthcare contract. The Conservative Party have previously denied that the\ndonations had any influence on policy-making.\nCollege members were poorly represented at\nthe protest, with most of the students involved\ncoming from UCL. Reactions of passer-bys\nwere, however, mixed. Humam, who did want\nto give his full name, pointed out that a system\nsimilar to the one proposed by the coalition\nalready seemed to be working well in Germany. On the other hand, Ben Bell, a third year\nmechanical engineer, said that he would have\nliked to have attended the demonstration from\nthe beginning and wished that it \u201ccould have\nbeen better publicised\u201d.\nThe protest passed peacefully and wound\ndown quietly after just over an hour. The jury\nis still out over whether it did any good. Laurence Pope, a second year life sciences student\nnot involved in the event, said that while the\npeople involved were certainly \u201cloud enough\u201d\nand that he thought that they might affect a\nfew students\u2019 opinions, they were unlikely to\nchange Lansley\u2019s policies.\nIn brief\nLibrary to remain open over Easter\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNominations for Union sabbatical\nelections open\nNominations for the 2011 Imperial College Union Sabbatical elections have now opened.

Imperial is currently the only university in\nthe UK to have formally announced its\nintentions.\nThe decision was announced in a message to staff on Monday by Rector Sir\nKeith O\u2019Nions, who said: \u201cTo maintain\nthe excellence of the education we provide to students it is our intention, subject to agreement by the Office for Fair\nAccess, to set fees at \u00a39,000 for Home\nand European Union students for 2012\nentry.\u201d Government budget cuts have\nbeen a major factor for universities\nmoving towards higher fees \u2013 Oxford\nUniversity, whilst having made no formal decisions about tuition fees, has said\nthat fees of \u00a38,000 would be necessary\nto replace the budget cuts and maintain\nteaching standards.\nWith the increase in fees there is the\nlegitimate fear of excluding individuals\nfrom deprived backgrounds. To ensure\nequal access, the \u2018Student Fees and Financial Aid Working Group\u2019 has been\nlooking at two models. Imperial College\nUnion President Alex Kendall explained\nearlier this month that Imperial could\neither charge \u00a36,000 tuition fees for everyone \u2013 with significant reductions in\nfinancial aid \u2013 or a \u201c\u00a39,000 fee so that\nthose with a large household income pay\nand everyone whose family earns below\n\u00a360,000 gets some form of subsidy\u201d.\n\u201cKeep the Cat Free\u201d\nFELIX\nThe student voice of Imperial College London since 1949\nISSUE 1483\n18.02.11\nINTERVIEWWITHALEX KENDALL\nSCIENCE\nImperial blogger\nnominated for\nBloggie: Page 13\nMUSIC\nBow down before your\nalien overlord, puny\nEarthlings!: Page 28\nGAMES\nThe Guitar Hero\nfranchise finally dies:\nPage 35\nThe Union President talks about leading the Life Sciences protests,higher\ntuition fees and what\u2019s still to improve in Metric: Page 8\nCash-strapped\nlibraries\nthreaten to\nend journal\nsubscription\ndeals over\nrising costs\nI\nntimidating isn\u2019t the first\nword that springs to mind\nwhen you first meet Deborah Shorley, Director\nof the Imperial College\nLondon Library.

    "content": "FILM\nCan the BAFTAs be a good\nprediction for the Oscars?\nDespite the rain on February 13th,\nLeicester Square was once again a buzzing night of flashbulbs and red carpet\nwalks as it played host to the 63rd annual BAFTA awards. A semi-reliable\npredictor of which way the Oscars might\nswing, the BAFTAs has becoming an increasingly high profile event in the film\nworld, injecting a bit of life and glamour\ninto the British film scene and bringing big names to the capital. Julianne\nMoore, Jessica Alba and Mark Ruffalo,\nwere among the Hollywood faces who\nturned up, but the big winners of the\nnight were the cast and crew of the recent British hit, The King\u2019s Speech.\nA runaway winner, The King\u2019s Speech\ntook away seven awards, including Best\nFilm, Best British Film, Best Original\nScreenplay, Best LeadingActor (for Colin Firth) and both of the Best Supporting\nawards for Helena Bonham-Carter and\nGeoffrey Rush. Whether or not this success will be repeated on the 27th of February at the Academy Awards remains to\nbe seen. Though last year\u2019s big winner,\nThe Hurt Locker, took away Best Film\nand Best Director at both the BAFTAs\nand the Oscars, the idea of the Academy\ngiving this many major awards to a British film seems unlikely.\nIt\u2019s been a good year for cinema, and\none that has left one of the most celebrated films of the year, Inception, going fairly unrecognised in awards season\n\u2013 it scooped a handful of BAFTAs but\nmainly technical awards (Best Sound,\nBest Production Design etc.). Up against\nfour other films from a good year, it\u2019s\neven more of an achievement that The\nKing\u2019s Speech beat Inception, The Social\nNetwork, True Grit and Black Swan to\nthe title of Best Film.\nThe Social Network didn\u2019t go completely unappreciated. David Fincher\npicked up Best Director for it, and it also\ngot a nod in the Best Adapted Screenplay category, whilst Black Swan received recognition by way of Natalie\nPortman\u2019s Best Leading Actress award.\nA nice touch for British cinema was\nChris Morris\u2019 Best Debut win for Four\nLions. Even though most Chris Morris\nfans will have known him for some time\nas the creator of Brass-Eye and Nathan\nBarley television series, it\u2019s a well-deserved acknowledgement for one of\nthe most talented filmmakers in Britain today. British actor Tom Hardy also\nwent home with the Orange Rising Star\nAward, most likely for his breakthrough\nappearance in Inception, though his previous roles in British films Bronson and\nL4yer Cake have definitely made him\nworth of this award \u2013 definitely more\nworthy than last year\u2019s winner Kristen\n\u201cTwilight\u201d Stewart.\nSo how good is this as a predictor\nof Oscars? It\u2019d be a big surprise if The\nKing\u2019s Speech repeated this clean sweep\non the 27th, and after winning Best Leading Actor last year for A Single Man,\nFELIX 31\nBAFTA Winners\nBest Film\nThe Kings Speech\nBest Director\nDavid Fincher\n(The Social Network)\nLeading Actor\nColin Firth (The King\u2019s Speech)\nLeading Actress\nNatalie Portman (Black Swan)\nSupporting Actor\nGeoffery Rush\n(The King\u2019s Speech)\nSupporting Actress\nHelen Bonham Carter\n(The King\u2019s Speech)\nOriginal Screenplay\nDavid Seidler\n(The King\u2019s Speech)\nAdapted Screenplay\nAaron Sorkin\n(The Social Network)\nOutstanding Debut by a British\nWriter, Director or Producer\nChris Morris (Four Lions)\nFilm not in the English\nLanguage\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\nBest Animated Film\nToy Story 3\nOriginal Music\nAlexandre Desplat\n(The King\u2019s Speech)\nCinematography\nRoger Deakins (True Grit)\nEditing\nAngus Wall, Kirk Baxter\n(The Social Network)\nRising Star Award\nTom Hardy\nOutstanding British\nContribution to Cinema\nThe Harry Potter Films\nAcademy Fellowship\nSir Christopher Lee\nJade Hoffman\nColin Firth is unlikely to be awarded\nit again. Instead, The Social Network\u2019s\nJesse Eisenberg could be in with a better\nshot, with films like The Social Network\nand The Fighter likely to pick up more\nthan they did at the BAFTAs. How the\nexact breakdown will be at the Academy\nAwards, however, is not clear-cut. The\nonly sure-fire thing to put your money\non is probably the Pixar failsafe option\nin the Best Animated Film category with\nToy Story 3.\nBlood Ties is a lesson in budget filmmaking\nDirector Kely McClung\nScreenwriter Kely McClung\nCast Kely McCLung, Robert Pralgo,\nErik Markus Schuetz\nBlood Ties\nSaphira Gurski\nSurely they\u2019re called \u201cbig budget action\nflicks\u201d for a reason!? I was initially excited yet cringing at the thought of reviewing an indie action flick. Indie film\nvirgins like myself need not despair; this\nfilm is not a desperation tune-in to Air\nCanada\u2019s In-flight film fest after 10 hours\nof inter-continental leg cramps. Blood\nTies will snatch you out of mainstream\ncinema drudgery and entice you into the\nworld of micro-budget film viewing.\nDirector (and lead actor) Kely McClung creates saturated visuals, a\nsense of movement and an ethereal\nbackground glow calling to mind the\notherworldly sensation in Nolan films\nwhich drags viewers into the screen\n(no 3D glasses required). Luckily, this\ngritty dreamscape fabricated in the\nback streets of Thailand and Eastern\nUS doesn\u2019t overshadow the story. Jack\nDavis (Director Kely McClung), former\nfederal agent \u201cG.I. Joe\u201d, discovers his\nbrother Jim (The Vampire Diaries\u2019 Robert Pralgo) is kidnapped and flies off to\nthe danger-filled alleys of Thailand to\nsecure his freedom. What Jack doesn\u2019t\nknow is his former shadowy employers\nare pulling the strings from the USA.\nThe film subtly reveals a much deeper,\nintriguing tragedy beneath martial arts\naction \u00e1 la Jacky Chan.\nThe most beautiful yet at brief points\nfrustrating part of the film is the complexity of storyline and characters\nshown without words. In a few scenes\nI felt like additional dialogue would\u2019ve\nadded more depth, but in most, there\nwas a raw beauty in exploring characters through expression and reactions\n\u2013 silent, physical or emotional \u2013 you\u2019d\nsee in real life. Far more satisfying than\ndialogue filmed for the sake of exposi-tion, this drags you into contemplating\neverything you see.\nCareful casting adds an additional\nlayer of gritty realism. Average-Joe\nAmericans are cast as non-descript military black-operatives instead of Hollywood beach boys. Thai gang kidnappers convince you they\u2019re a street gang\nfor hire that took a job on a movie set\nas an amusing break from their nightly\nprowl. Tuk-Tuks and their drivers were\npaid to film a chase scene in Bangkok\ntraffic and main characters are played\nby real-life martial arts experts fighting\nwith visually exotic techniques you\u2019ve\nnever seen in a mainstream action flick.\nMy favourite scene involves Jack and a\nThai girl \u2013 who genuinely can\u2019t speak\nEnglish \u2013 expressing their love for one\nanother through a very real language\nbarrier. Blood Ties skips the \u201cacting\u201d of\nmost films and simply captures beauti-ful, real moments of interaction between\ncharacters.\nClearly, there\u2019s a reason Blood Ties\nhas been cleaning up the awards circuit\n(Best International Film in UK at the\nEnd of the Pier Int\u2019l Film Festival, Film\nof the Year at the Action on Film Festival, etc). Its exotic visuals and martial\narts scenes will get your blood pump-ing, but its mind-bendingly subtle story\nand characters are what will keep this on\nyour DVD rack for ages!\nI\u2019m not sure if \u2018bland\u2019 is her colour...\n\u201cIt captures beauftiful\ninteractions between\ncharacters.\u201d\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 13\nSCIENCE\nImperial science blog star up for award\nD\navid Robertson is the small\ntown blogger done good. In\nonly 2 years he has converted\nhis own little personal website into\none of the globe\u2019s most eminent science blogs (davidpj.wordpress.com).\nJust this month, it has been nominated for the 2011 Weblog Awards Best\nScience Blog. Felix Science caught up\nwith the web celebrity to discuss blog-ging, science, and blatant self promo-tion.\nCould you say a little about your\nbackground?\nI\u2019m originally from Australia, where I\ndid an Environmental Science degree\non the sunny Gold Coast. After my degree I stayed on to do a few years of re-search, but started to feel a bit trapped\nin the university grind. I took on a\ncouple of extra part-time roles with science outreach organisations, and really\nenjoyed them. With a real desire to see\nmore of the world, I decided to move\nto London and study science commu-nication!\nWhen did you start, and why did you\nstart blogging?\nI started blogging early in 2009. I\u2019d\nrecently started photography and also\nknew that I wanted an outlet to express\nmyself more, and a blog was an obvious\nchoice. It was a bit of fun at first, a place\nto rant and put up stories about surf trips\nand the like.\nWhat do you write about on your blog?\nWhatever I like! It reflects a lot of what I\ndo in my life, so it\u2019s got science, photog-raphy, music, surf, random videos and\nlinks that I like and stories from what\nI\u2019ve been doing. Lately there\u2019s been\nmore science and definitely less surf!\nHow has your blogging style changed\nover time?\nIf anything, it changes to reflect what\nI\u2019m doing at the time. So, while I was\nworking in Australia, it was about\nweekend trips and concerts and stuff.\nThen, when I went on a big road trip\nand followed it up to my move to London, it turned into a travel log; and\nmost recently, it\u2019s morphing more into\na science theme, because that\u2019s what\nI\u2019m studying!\nDo you think we need specialist science communicators, such as your-self, or is it something that scientists\nthemselves should be doing?\nThat\u2019s a really good question! If I didn\u2019t\nthink it was worthwhile, I wouldn\u2019t be\ndoing the course, so I\u2019m probably not\nthe most objective person to ask.\nI think that science communicators\ntake some of the pressure off scientists;\nwhile it\u2019s important, not everyone who\ndoes research has a flair for publicity,\nand science communicators can help to\nshare new knowledge. However, I also\nthink science has a big aesthetic dimen-sion. It\u2019s not just about scientists telling people about their work, but about\nenjoying the discovery, the beauty of\nscientific explanations and uncovering\nthe interesting stories that surround the\ndoing of science. That\u2019s where science\ncommunicators can find a niche.\nWhy do you think academics aren\u2019t\nblogging more?\nI think that, in certain fields, they actually are! If you look into the world of science blogs, many disciplines have quite\nprominent representatives. Obviously\nthere aren\u2019t thousands of blogs about\neach subject, but if you have a research\narea, you can probably find an academic\nwho blogs about it. However, it is quite\ntime consuming and can also be very\npersonal; not everyone has the desire or\nthe motivation to share their research or\nthoughts online.\nWhat do you think the role of the internet is in the future of science com-munication?\nI think it\u2019s already quite immense. While\nscientific publication is still, largely, in\nthe paper-based model, research blogging and critique are already changing\nhow the scientific world deals with important new results. It is a new, diverse\nmedium which incorporates elements\nof everything that has come before: im-ages, videos, text and sound, with a huge\nextra element of interactivity.\nHowever, it also has pitfalls: it\u2019s easy\nto find any opinion online, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to know which sites and\nsources to trust, both on science or any\nissue.\nWhy do you think your blog has become so successful?\nIt\u2019s not that successful yet! I think it\u2019s\nhaving a diversity of content and a fairly\nI\nmperial\u2019s David Robertsonmight be up for a Bloggie, but\nwhat about the rest of us? It\nmight not be something you\u2019ve\nthought about, but science\nblogging is an activity that could be\nworth considering. And with funding\ntighter than ever, it might be time to\nstart fleshing out that CV and publications list with some extras.\nA blog may seem like an attractive option. You get to share some\nof your interest in science with the\nwider world, connect with other sci-entists, and (most importantly) it\ncan be done from the comfort of\nyour sofa. If you get good you may\neven be given the opportunity to join\none of the many new, emerging networks of science blogs run by more\ntraditional media outlets like the\nGuardian or Wired Magazine. But it\nmay be worth thinking twice before\nregistering that domain name.\nAs a student, blogging can be a\ngood way to make sure you\u2019ve really learnt the material. As an aca-demic, it can be a way to make new\nconnections and explore areas of\nscience outside your almost certainly narrow specialism. But there\nare some pitfalls, and you need to\nmake sure you don\u2019t fall into them.\nProfessor Henry Rzepa, of the\nChemistry Department at Imperial,\nstarted his blog three years ago\nand treats it as a \u201cresearch notebook\u201d. Some of his blog posts have\neven turned into research\nprojects, which in turn have\nbeen published in high profile peer review journals.\nRzepa sees his blog as\npart of his \u201cbrand\u201d as a scien-tist, although stresses that he\ntries to keep it quite light-hearted\nand entertaining, writing in a style\nthat is very different to a traditional\nscientific paper. It\u2019s also given him\na chance to \u201chop across subject\nbounds\u201d into areas he wouldn\u2019t\nhave otherwise considered.\nHowever, Rzepa was already an\nestablished name within the research community when he started\nblogging. For a younger scientist,\nforever chasing positions and fund-ing, he admits that the story might\nbe a little different.\nYou need to strike a balance:\nblogs often have a personal slant,\nand tend to feel much less formal than more traditional media.\nBut it\u2019s possible to go too far. It\u2019s\ngenerally not a good idea to use\nyour blog to complain about your\nlab mates or latest experimental\nfailure. As a young scientist, you\nnever know who you might need\nto depend on for help as you scale\nthe academic career ladder, or\nwho might look at your blog in\nfuture years when you\u2019re applying for jobs. Rzepa says\nhe never publishes anything on his blog that can\u2019t be\nbacked up with evidence.\nAs long as you can refrain from\nranting, the benefits can be worth\nthe time. And it will be your own\ntime you spend on it.\nProfessor Andrew Jaffe, of the\nPhysics Department at Imperial,\nsaid that a blog is generally seen\nin a positive light, but only if it\u2019s\ndone after hours and doesn\u2019t take\naway significantly from real re-search. \u201cFunding agencies want to\nhave their cake and eat it too; the\nideal is for [blogging] to be a high\nquality hobby\u201d.\nJaffe believes, and I\u2019m sure most\nscientists would agree, that quality and quantity of research is the\nmost important thing for a scientist early on in their career. As time\ngoes on, and you\u2019ve gained approval from your peers, there may\nbe more time to spend on \u201cextras\u201d\nsuch as blogs and other outreach.\nSo, blogs can be rewarding if you\ndo them right. They can lead to new\nresearch interests and collabora-tions, or even just be an outlet for\nwriting talent that isn\u2019t fulfilled by\nwriting those endless academic pa-pers. But if you\u2019re just looking for\nsomewhere to rant, you\u2019ll need to\nfind a good pseudonym.\nK elly Oakes\neasygoing approach. I like my blog to be\naccessible and fun to read wherever pos-sible, and that makes it easy for people\nto return to.\nWhat\u2019s the future for you and your\nblog?\nMe? I wish I knew! I\u2019d like to pursue\noutreach and engagement in science, or\nperhaps policy, depending on the opportunities I get. The blog will no doubt\nkeep ticking over; it seems to have a bit\nof a life of its own!\nInterview by Charlie Harvey\nThe state of academic blogging at Imperial\nVote for David\u2019s blog at\n2011.bloggi.es/#science\nDavid Robertson has a camera and a nomination for a Bloggie\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

Mr Pickass (stop laughing)\nclaimed there had been some \u2018electoral hold\nup.\u2019 More precisely he held up the results and,\non camera, tore them up. All of this occurred\nin front of a room full of journalists who were\n\u2018asked\u2019 to leave. The results weren\u2019t read out\nthat day. So they only printed out one copy of\nPOLITICS\nFELIX\n16\nPolitics Editors: Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nAlgeria\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been\nindicted to face trial on charges of paying for sex\nwith an underaged prostitute called Ruby and\nabuse of power. Mr Berlusconi\u2019s trial is expected to\nbegin in April and he faces up to 15 years imprisonment if convicted. Mr Berlusconi has denied paying\nfor sex with Ruby and denies abusing his power by\nseeking her release when she was detained in another case, claiming that he was doing former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a favour after being\ntold that Ruby was his granddaughter.\nItaly\nThe Algerian Government has said\nthat it will end its\n19 year old state\nof emergency within days. Algeria is\ncoming under increasing pressure\nto lift the state of emergency, which was imposed in\n1992 to halt a civil war, after protests in Tunisia and\nEgypt which led to the Government being toppled.\nThousands of protestors defied a police ban on Saturday and protested in Algiers. There is widespread\ndiscontentment in Algeria over poor housing condi-tions, unemployment and food prices sparking a riot\nin January. The Algerian Government is preparing to\nmake wholesale changes to the Government in a bid\nto head off discontent, although some protestors\nvowed to protest every Saturday until the Government resigns.\nMalaysia\nIslamic morality police in Malaysia have arrested\n96 people for khalwat or close proximity in an operation to stop them from celebrating Valentine\u2019s\nDay. Khalwat is an Islamic law preventing unmarried\nMuslims from being alone with members of the opposite sex. Under Malaysia\u2019s dual-track legal sys-tem, Shariah courts can try Muslims for religious\nand moral offences, with those arrested facing up\nto two years imprisonment. Religious authorities in\nMalaysia have said that Valentine\u2019s Day was synonymous with vice and has issued a fatwa against\ncelebrating it in 2005. However, not all Malaysian\nMuslims agreed with the campaign with some saying that celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day is harmless.\n\u201cBoth sides are saying\nthe other has been\nrigging the election. That\nmust be what hurts most\nfor the loser. You couldn\u2019t\neven win when you were\ncheating.\u201d\nThe last article I wrote was about Mubarak and\nhe resigned when it came out. Not saying it was\nall me but coincidences like that don\u2019t happen.\nSo now I\u2019m going to hope my curse can help\ntwo other countries.\nQuestion: What do Ivory Coast and Belgium\nhave in common? Answer: both are without a\nstable government. In fact Belgium has been\nwithout a real government for longer, over 200\ndays. A well known Belgian actor Benoit Poelvoorde has urged men not to shave until a permanent government is formed. A Belgian sena-tor, Marleen Temmerman, has gone to more\nextreme lengths saying wives should impose a\nsex ban on MPs until a government is formed,\nMale Belgian MPs should direct queries to Jacqui Smith\u2019s husband for tips on handling, no\npun intended, the situation. Definitely worth\nnoting that the senator was female, no matter\nhow desperate they are for a resolution, no man\nwould ever call for that. Although I also note\nshe mentioned MPs and not senators \u2013 clever\nmove. No specific mentions on what type either so I\u2019m sure there is a loophole somewhere.\nPerhaps Benoit Poelvoorde (he was in Man\nBites Dog and Coco before Chanel) and the\nSenator are working together. They both have\na beard fetish and like to be teased, it\u2019s the perfect crime.\nThe Belgian election was in June and no one\ngained a majority or came to an agreement on\na permanent coalition. If Belgium doesn\u2019t get\ntheir act together by March 30th they will actually have a world record. They will have gone\nthe longest since an election without forming a\ngovernment, beating Iraq. That\u2019s right, longer\nthan Iraq. If having to go without sex for a long\ntime isn\u2019t a motivator. The thought of beating\nIraq at what is essentially an arguing contest\nmust be enough to get everyone to agree on\nsomething. Likely starting with the immediate\nblacklisting of Marleen Temmerman.\nElsewhere, Ivory Coast is at a stalemate.\nWith dramatic uprisings elsewhere it has been\npushed fairly low down the news agenda. The\nelection consisted of a first round where no\noutright winner was produced and so entered\na second round. International observers described the election as \u2018generally fair.\u2019 Take\ninto account that it is part of their job to be dip-lomatic, and that becomes the faintest praise\npossible. Both the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo\nand opposition Alassane Ouattara are claiming victory and have named their cabinets. By\nthat I mean political cabinets not that they have\nsimultaneously become attached to their furni-ture.\nThey aren\u2019t people who are going to enter a\npower sharing agreement \u2013 I checked and they\ndefriended each other on Facebook. The international community is recognising Alassane\nOuattara as the President and Laurent Gbagbo\nis recognising Laurent Gbagbo as President.\nGbagbo is reminding me of a spoilt child. He\nhates losing, has locked himself inside his office and is refusing to come out. Gordon Brown\nElections never won\nTim Arbabzadah\nthe extremely important document containing\nthe election results? No printers around at all\nin the building? Not one! We have a shitload in\nthe library but they don\u2019t have one in a governmental building. Forget that for a second and\nthink of this. It was a runoff between two peo-ple, 3 regions were being announced \u2013 so that\u2019s\n6 numbers to remember. It\u2019s like an exam. Later Gbagbo said that not all of the results had\nbeen read out and so the result was not valid,\ntherefore he won. Well of course they weren\u2019t\nread out; as previously established, you got\nsomeone to rip them up.\nThe full results are inconclusive. Both sides\nare saying the other has been rigging the elec-tion. In all likelihood both sides were. That\nmust be what hurts most for the loser. You\ncouldn\u2019t even win when you were cheating;\nit\u2019s like being an athlete in the 80\u2019s. African\nnations have met to try to decide what should\nbe done. They have been pressured to intervene\nbut that is extremely unlikely to happen. The\nmain problem is that some of the leaders at\nthe summit were not exactly as fairly elected\nas they should have been. The meeting, which\ntook place on the 1st of February, concluded\nwith the decision that they should give themselves a deadline of 1 month to think of some-thing. Here was me worried they would end up\njust doing fuck all but wait and hope for the\nbest. They had better pull an epic all nighter\nat the end of February. Maybe as February is\nshorter than other months, if they aren\u2019t ready,\nthey will do what I would and say they meant\n30 days not calendar months. We will all have\nto wait to see how these two situations end. I\ndon\u2019t know about you but I think I would rather be Ouattara than a Belgian MP right now.

    "content": "18\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nP\noliticians want your vote,\nand they will do anything\nto get it. So it has been, so it\nwill always be. But the difference today, in this age of\ngrowing individualism, television and\ninternet and is that to sell you whatever\nyou want, whoever you may be, their\nface needs to be seen. And what does\nthis mean? Utter despair on my part at\nthe lengths political leaders will go to be\nseen as hip, serious, family orientated,\nfunny, conscientious, laid\u2013back \u2013 the list\ngoes on.\nToday, they are everymen, desperate\nto appeal to everyone, often at the cost\nof policy and promises. Now they\u2019re\nprobably best suited to be actors, and\nI\u2019m not just talking charisma and public speaking like the days of old, I mean\nabsolute character actors of the highest\norder, rather than overlooked thesps.\nIt wasn\u2019t always this bad. All politicians had to do since the dawn of mass\nmedia was deliver uncomfortable radio\ninterviews or doubly uncomfortable tel-evisual ones and then get back to their\njob. Of course, the media has changed,\nalongside the growing prevalence of television and the internet. Reality TV has\nput the lives of the individual at the fore-front. \u201cThese guys run our country,\u201d the\npeople shout, \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t we know\neverything about them?\u201d\nBlair was probably the first Prime\nMinister able to deal with a more technological age; his charisma saw ministerial duties pass without great mishap.\nHe was down with Jarvis Cocker! I saw\nthrough him, of course. Even in \u201997 I\ncould see through his smug grin, though\nI was probably biased, John Major had\nSWEET glasses.\nBut then it all went downhill. Gordon\nBrown enters office and crisis after crisis hits. MPs\u2019 expenses, recession and\nthe desire to follow both Blair and Cameron\u2019s charm offensive. Suddenly, the\nPrime Minister wants to be bestie mates\nwith you, yes you! I wish I\u2019d been there\nwhen some genius suggested he appear\non Youtube. We are today blessed with\ncountless minutes of Brown\u2019s determined grimace.\nThen it was time to turn the computer\noff and put Britain\u2019s Got Talent on. Yes\nthat\u2019s right, Brown, tell us what you like\nto watch with the kids. Ring up Susan\nBoyle and ask how she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s for\nthe good of the country, yeah? I\u2019m sure\nthere\u2019s nothing else more important. Literally nothing. At all.\nWhich leads us to the nexus of pain,\nthe build up to the 2010 election. Everyone was at it, at the expense of any\ncredibility or policy. Ostensibly motivated by American politics, but no doubt\ninspired by part time music mogul and\nfull time cretin Simon Cowell and The\nX Factor, the three main leaders took\npart in perhaps the most ill advised and\ngut wrenchingly unconvincing \u2018debates\u2019\nthat I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure to see.\nCameron once met someone of a different race? Nice job, Dave!\nAnd, oh God, the morning chat show\npublicity tour. A party leader on GMTV\nis as misplaced as Boris Johnson in a\ngaffe\u2013free zone. Yes, please ask Mr\nBrown what he enjoys for breakfast. Oh\nI\u2019d simply LOVE to know what box sets\nMr Cameron is watching in his copious free time. The Wire? What a guy!\nAt least now GMTV\u2019s gone and nobody\nwatches Daybreak.\nTheir wives join in too, with Sarah\nBrown being paraded around alongside Samantha Cameron; look at these\nhigh\u2013powered businesswomen, with\ntheir nice shoes. That\u2019s obviously what\nPop star politicians\nwe want from a leader. Doesn\u2019t it just\nwarm the heart? No, it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s\nyour answer.\nAt least it\u2019s all worn off a bit now in\nthis inter-election political hinterland.\nWell mainly, though Clegg\u2019s still there,\nnow criticising Cambridge and Oxford\u2019s decision to raise their fees. A right\nmaster of disguise, eh? He\u2019d give Tom\nCruise a run for his money, not least his\nsituation being a real Mission: Impossible, zing!\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that\nit\u2019s great that you politicians want votes,\nbut seriously, get behind your desks and\nback to sorting out important things \u2013\nlike policy. Get it into your heads that\nthe leader of a political party can\u2019t always relate to everyone, and if you try,\nwith your forced smiles and your dire\njokes, it\u2019s really going to put me through\nsevere mental trauma. And that\u2019s basically akin to punching a basket of kit-tens, guys.\nI won\u2019t be too mean though, go ahead\nand sit down with your family in front\nof Saturday night TV, but if I ever want\nyour opinion on why Lucy never gets\npicked on Take Me Out, I\u2019ll bloody well\nask for it.\nWe don\u2019t want politicians who watch X Factor, so stop\nfaking it guys, and get back to running the country\nUniversities are facing a drastic funding\nshortfall. As Felix reported last week, the\nHigher Education Funding Council for England has announced that it will be cutting\nthe money that it gives to universities by\nalmost \u00a31 billion for 2011/12. These cuts\ncould affect all areas of a university\u2019s ac-tivities, and it will be up to individual institutions to decide what to prioritize. Even\nthough fees of \u00a39,000 will go some way to\nplugging the shortfall in funding, austere\ntimes lie ahead of us.\nThis is the prime motivator for Research\nLibraries UK\u2019s (RLUK) campaign to persuade publishers like Elsevier and Wiley\nBlackwell to reduce the cost of their journal subscriptions. In the first decade of\nthis new millennium, universities and their\nlibraries were comparatively well off. There\nwas enough money in the sector to allow librarians to loosen their purse strings; there\nwas enough money to accept supinely the\n6% yearly price rises demanded by publish-ers. Now, however, this state of affairs cannot continue. As David Prosser, Executive\nDirector of RLUK, succinctly puts it: \u201cIt was\nunsustainable in the long-term and there\nwas always going to be a crunch-point. That\ncrunch-point has now arrived.\u201d\nResearchers must accept this fact. They\ntoo will be aware that budgets are tighten-ing; indeed their funding will also be under\npressure. Work with libraries and there\u2019s a\nchance that subscription costs will become\nmore sustainable, therefore ensuring continued access to the world-class service\nthat big publishers provide while not endangering other library services and subscriptions . Blindly demand the status quo at any\ncost and ruin lies ahead.\nThis could mean accepting the short-term\npain that the contingency plan might bring.\nThe back-up plan being developed will admittedly provide a service that will not\nmatch what researchers currently receive.\nBut rejecting it on this basis would be to\nignore the fact that libraries can no longer\nafford the prices that big publishers have\ndemanded in the past.\nThe point is not to pillory the publishers.\nThe role that they perform is not trivial and\nthey have invested significantly in enabling\nmodern scientific research. The statements\nthat they have made in public give the impression that they are sympathetic to the\nproblems faced by libraries. One hopes\nthey are not simply posturing. The zeitgeist\nhas changed irrevocably. University libraries\nhave understood this; it is essential that researchers and publishers do the same.\nFELIX\nMatt Colvin\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nResearchers should get\nbehind our libraries and\nsupport their campaign\nAh, I see Boris has gone for the old \u2018tickle behind the knee\u2019. What a player...\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nC omment Editor: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\n\u201c\u201d\nRing up Susan Boyle and ask\nhow she\u2019s doing.

The Igua\u00e7u Falls\nare formed by several spectacular drops of the\nIgua\u00e7u River culminating in an 82 metre plummet termed \u2018Devil\u2019s Throat\u2019, a glorious junction uniting Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina.\nHearsay declares that in awe of this thundering\nvision Eleanor Roosevelt apparently exclaimed\n\u201cpoor Niagra!\u201d\nCarrying huge expectations, our first impression of Foz do Igua\u00e7u was of a greasy\ndirty strip stifled by fast food joints; burgers,\nhotdogs, fries, sushi, chinese, supermercados,\nsupermoffatos and pizza, interspersed within a\nriot of Las Vegas-style coloured lighting. Disappointed, we took an early night.\nIn the morning before visiting the waterfalls,\nwe were convinced by a travelling Irish couple\nto join them in slipping over the border in a\nrickety local bus to Paraguay until midday to\nvisit an electrical goods market. Imagine streets\nchock-a-block with stalls simmering with the\nsounds of hustlers selling knock-off brands,\nperfumes, tyres, shoes, laptops, chargers, mo-Priya Garg the contemplates the naural beauty of Foz do\nIgua\u00e7u, and its fragility at the hands of mass tourism\nYes, the waterfalls are indeed devastatingly\nbeautiful.

We imagined them, hacking for days\nthrough dense backwoods, picking at the edges\nof this spectacle until falling back in astonishment of the majesty of this wondrous sight.\nThere they could revel alone in solitude and\npeace.\nNow, in the searing heat, it was a noisy, busy\ncommercial centre where after paying a hefty\nticket fee you can duck past children flicking\nwater, elbow tourists meandering over cement walkways, stumble over recycling bins\nand saunter past overpriced caf\u00e9s on your trip\naround the waterfalls.\nHow can a waterfall be owned?

There was red dust, chat-tering, honking cars, people dragging large\nplastic bags, hawkers and con artists everywhere amidst unfinished buildings and Paraguayans hanging off flimsy tiers of wooden\nscaffolding.

Designer V scored\nan early brace before a potential comeback by\nKings was snuffed out by a counter attack fortuitously finished off by B Tablet.\nStraight from the push off IC broke with pace\nand forced an early short corner. Looking to\nmake a mark on the game the Men\u2019s 3s pulled\nout the infamous sex panther short corner rou-tine. This led to our illustrious captain driving\nhis finish into the bottom left after a brilliant\nassist from A Beads.\nFollowing this period of early domination,\nIC continued to stamp their authority on the\nmatch as they kept possession for long periods.\nHard work lead to many more scoring opportunities but the final ball was always lacking.\nSeeing that King\u2019s were putting 10 men behind\nthe ball, IC knew that set pieces would be their\nbest opportunity to score again and pressed\nhard for another short corner.\nThis tactic quickly paid dividends as Cockerel\ndrove into the circle and with a quick change of\ndirection planted the ball on a King\u2019s defender\u2019s\nfoot for the second short of the game. Another\nsweet routine ended with Fresher Tom\u2019s beautiful pull back providing a golden opportunity\nfor Designer V. This was duly converted and IC\nwent 2-0 up with just 15 minutes played.\nArrogance started to drift into IC\u2019s play and\nthey were made to pay as they gifted a goal\nto their opponents. What should have been a\nroutine interception from B Tablet resulted in a\nsimple tap in for the King\u2019s striker with virtually his first touch of the ball.\nIC quickly rallied, and their next goal again\ncame from a set piece but this time from a\nKing\u2019s one. Defending a short corner IC won\nthe ball back thanks to a champion diving\ntackle by Fritzl (which is becoming somewhat\nof a weekly fixture). A pinpoint hit from Bottle\nTop found Fresher November, whose accurate\npass pierced through the King\u2019s defence and\nlanded perfectly on B Tablet\u2019s stick. Facing\na one on one in the D, B Tablet shot straight\nat the keeper, but in true 3s style he followed\nup and, somewhat fortuitously, scored his first\never goal. Try as they might, IC couldn\u2019t add to\ntheir tally and went into the break 3-1 up.\nThe second half was a rather stale affair with\nneither team able to create many chances. Of\nthe two King\u2019s created, one was fantastically\nsnuffed out by Fresher Alex\u2019s covering tackle.\nThe other one lead to Sifter getting his first\ntouch of the ball as, with tiger-like reflexes, he\ndived to his right knocking a scorching shot\nround the post. IC\u2019s best chance of the half\ncame from Brickney after a one-two with Teabag left him with a tough reverse stick shot that\nshook the cross bar.\nFollowing the match, Kings foolishly challenged IC to a boat race hoping to regain some pride. With confidence\nstill oozing from the 3\u2019s after\nvictory on the pitch Gingypop\u2019s\nstormer lead IC to their second\nwin of the day.\nsoon left that a pipe dream after a catastrophic\nrun out did for Parmar and it was once again\nleft to the middle order to rescue the innings.\nAnkit Patel, the grandfather of IC cricket, came\nto the fore and batted wonderfully well with little support from the other end. He manipulated\nthe attack and the slightly better total of 85-5\nwas thanks almost entirely to him.\nImperial\u2019s bowlers struggled to contain the\nCoventry openers and had there been a repeat\nof the opening spell of the first game a tight\ncontest might have ensued, but the batting side\nhad wickets in hand, and despite another good\nspell from Ismail, Coventry were able to reach\nthe target. It was a bitter pill to swallow for the\nImperial boys who greatly surpassed last year\u2019s\nachievements by reaching this latter stage.\nAll that was left was to put intimate local\nknowledge to use, find a curry house to wash\naway the bad taste of the day\u2019s play and to\ncurse the cricketing Gods\nfor bringing us to such a\nwretched place.\nNEXT WEEK:\nTime to bring The Bottle\nTime to bring The Bottle home\nhome\nPreview of 2011 Bottle Match\nCricketers\nstruggle\nat BUCS\nTournament\n...Continued from Back Page\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX 3\nFriday 18 february 2011\nBreakdown of hall\nrents revealed\nSOLE results show\nhigh satisfaction\nThe College has recently released results of the 2010 Autumn Student Online Evaluation (SOLE) survey aimed\nat measuring undergraduate students'\nopinions about the teaching in the first\ncollege term. The results of the survey\nare mainly positive, with overall satisfaction across the College for different\naspects of lecture courses ranging from\n84% to 92%. The proportion of students\nanswering either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d\nsaw a marked increase from 2009 for all\nthe questions which had also been asked\nthat year.\nThe survey targets students in all\nyears, apart from medicine, where only\nfirst years are questioned. Participants\nare asked to rate to their feelings towards a number of statements using a\nfive point scale, as well as give written\ncomments on what they believe should\nbe improved. The results are reviewed\nby all the departments\u2019 Directors of\nUndergraduate Studies, and in previous\nyears have led to changes in courses and\nlecturers even being replaced.\nThe latest SOLE introduced a new\nsection which questioned all students,\napart from those in the Business School\nand Humanities Department, about their\nopinions relating to assessment and feed-back. The results here were more mixed,\nsuggesting that the problems identified\nin the National Student's Survey earlier\nlast year have not yet all been resolved.\n19% of students thought that \"the level\nof detail received in comments on [their]\nwork\" and \"the helpfulness of feedback\nin clarifying things [they] did not under-stand\" was poor or very poor. Overall\nsatisfaction in these areas, however, was\nstill between 69% and 81%.\nThe humanities lecture courses were\njudged to be some of the best in the col-lege, with approval ratings of between\n88% and 95%. 86% of students rated\n\u201cthe interest and enthusiasm generated by the lecturer\u201d as either \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201cvery good\u201d, the best such result in the\nsurvey.\nThe department of Earth Science and\nEngineering, on the other hand, had\nsome of the best results in the assessment and feedback section, with satisfaction levels between 88% and 94%.\nDr Lorraine Craig, the department\u2019s Academic Tutor, attributed this success to\n\"excellent teaching in the department\".\nThe student participation rate in the\nsurvey has been steadily increasing over\nthe past three years, reaching 67% this\nAutumn, making the results reasonably\nrepresentative of the student population.\nThe Mathematics Department saw by\nfar the largest improvement. Having had\nthe worst turnout in the last two years\nit managed to increase its participation\nrate from 41% in 2009 to 67% in 2010.\nThe head of the department, Dr Emma\nMcCoy, attributed this success to the department\u2019s new policy, borrowed from\nElectrical Engineering, of \"giving extra\nprinting credit to those who complete\nSOLE\". She said the success of scheme\nmeant that it was likely the department\nwould use it in the future.\nAs in the previous few years participation was greatest in the department of\nEarth Science and Engineering, with all\nof its 229 undergraduates taking part.\nProfessor Martin Blunt, the department\nhead Dr Lorraine Craig, whose position \u201ccombines the roles of Director of\nUndergraduate Studies, Admissions Tutor and Senior Tutor\". He said that the\ndepartment's small size allowed her to\nhave \"a personal rapport\" with all the\nstudents. Dr Craig sent out \"reminders\nto all students to complete the SOLE\nsurvey\", which were \"reinforced by every lecturer during classes\". The department also discusses how it uses the data\nobtained with groups of students from\ndifferent years, thereby making sure\nthey understand the survey's benefits.\nThis has resulted in excellent participation rates without the need for additional\nincentives such as in Mathematics.\nThe SOLE survey will take place\nagain at the end of this term in all departments and in summer for students\ntaking Chemistry, Civil & Enviromental\nEngineering, Earth Science & Engineering or Life Sciences. Students can view\nthe full results from the latest survey on\nthe college website.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nHalls should not be subsidising alcohol with the\namenities fund argues Union President\nThe price of university hall accommodation has come under scrutiny as a survey is set to be launched by the Union\ninto how hall rents could be reduced.\nThe Union has obtained a breakdown\nof what makes up the rent and are debating a range of cost-saving measures.\nStudents are encouraged to take part in\nthe debate by filling out a questionnaire,\nto be released early next week.\nAlex Kendall, Imperial College Union\nPresident, said that \u201cthe idea [to provide\nmore information about hall rents] originally came up because I was surprised\n[to find] that first years pay for the fact\nthat we have free Ethos membership\nfrom their hall rents\u201d. Other costs that\nmake up the rent include the amenities\nfund, cleaning, contract length and war-dening, as well as other costs like heat-ing, electricity and internet.\nScrapping the \u201camenities fund\u201d\nthat each hall spends on social events\nthroughout the year such as event tickets,\nfood and alcohol could save each student\nbetween \u00a381.90 and \u00a3122.85 (based on\n39 weeks of rent). This comes directly\nfrom hall rents and the exact amount is\ndecided by each warden. The amenities\nfund is also used to promote Wardening\nvacancies. If the fund was scrapped hall\nevents would still take place, but would\nno longer be subsidised, therefore costing more for the people taking part.\nIt could be argued that this is a fairer\noption as the number of places on hall\ntrips and the amount of food and alcohol\navailable are often limited, and so some\nstudents can end up subsidising others\nwhilst reaping no benefits themselves.\nAlex Kendall believes it \u201cis a fundamental principle that no alcohol should\nbe funded from the amenities fund. I\u2019m\nvery interested to hear what students\nwho don\u2019t drink alcohol, because of\ntheir religious beliefs, think about this\nsince they\u2019re effectively subsidising\nother other people to do so.\u201d\nHowever, Dan Read, Warden of Falmouth and Keogh Halls, argues that\n\u201cremoving the subsidy from events in\nhalls would be very damaging to the\ncommunities that live there. Hall events\nthroughout the year and particularly in\nthe welcome weeks are extremely popular and help residents to make friends\nand enjoy shared experiences.\u201d He\nalso suggested that cutting this funding\nwould make minimal difference to rent\nprices anyway as \u201camenity contributions only amount to about 1% of rents.\u201d\nBen Cook, a second year Biologist\nwho lived in Wilkinson hall last year,\nalso commented that he \u201cwould not have\ngone to most events if they had not been\nsubsidised\u201d. Other options such as a\n\u00a310 common room charge for each term\nhave also been suggested.\nReducing the cleaning of communal\nareas such as kitchens from every day to\njust once a week, and removing cleaning of bedrooms entirely could also save\nstudents up to \u00a3195 per year. Instead,\ncleaning equipment such as vaccuum\ncleaners would be provided, like in\nmany other universities.\nStudents currently rent rooms in university halls for 39 weeks each year\n,which includes the Christmas and Easter holidays. It has been proposed that\nfour weeks of rent could be saved by\nreducing this to 35 weeks if students vacated their rooms during the Easter holi-day. The rooms could then be rented out\nto the public as they are in the summer\nperiod. If this were to be implemented,\nit would likely to be in only a few halls,\ngiving students the choice between a\n39 week contract or a cheaper 35 week\ncontract.\nThese efforts to drive down costs\ncome as new postgraduate halls in\nClapham Junction costing \u00a3235 per\nweek are set to open in the next academic year, described by Dan Read as\n\u201can unwise move especially as they will\nnot have warden cover and thus offer no\npastoral care for students.\u201d The recently\nrenovated Eastside and Southside halls\nalso have deluxe single rooms costing\n\u00a3227.36 per week and premium single\nrooms costing \u00a3195.37 per week. Alex\nKendall argues that there is not a problem in providing this more expensive\naccommodation. \u201cAccording to Accommodation Services, all students get\na room in the cost bracket they have\nidentified, and so there is an argument\nsaying that some students can afford to\nand want to live in more expensive accommodation.\u201d\nHowever, Joe Herbert, a second year\nbiologist who lived in Wilkinson Hall,\nargues that there shouldn\u2019t be as many\ndeluxe or premium rooms as there are.\n\u201cI know a lot of people who were allocated them but didn\u2019t ask for them, and\nyou don\u2019t get a choice, you take it or\nfind somewhere else to live.\u201d Dan Read\nalso added that \u201cthe extra features of\nthese deluxe rooms include a \u2018luggage\nrack\u2019, so one might wonder if this is really for the benefit of the students who\nstay in halls a full academic year or for\nthe lucrative summer accommodation\nSophia David\nCorrection\nIn the article entitled: \u201ciConnect: Eat for Cheap\u201d (Issue\n1481 \u2013 04/02/11) Nigel\nKheng\u2019s name was misspelled\n\u2018Zheng\u2019. Felix apologises for\nthis typo.\nEditor\nguests!\u201d\nCurrently, new students select five\npreferred choices from a range of twenty\nhalls of residence, varying in price from\n\u00a355.30 a week for a triple room in Fisher\nHall at Evelyn Gardens to \u00a3227.36 per\nweek for a deluxe single room in Eastside or Southside in Princes Gardens.\nHowever, the university website states\nthat it is not guaranteed that students\nwill be allocated one of their preferred\noptions, meaning students are often left\npaying more than they anticipated.\nKendall also warns of the future risk\nof losing the cheaper alternatives currently offered by Imperial. Fisher hall,\nstudents\u2019 cheapest option, is currently\nat risk of renovation and being lost as\nstudent accommodation. Kendall argues\nthat the university should be doing \u201ceverything it can to provide a cheap hall\noption close to campus\u201d.\nThe idea of reducing or scrapping cleaning in halls has been floated as a\nreducing the cost of accommodation\nDave Guttridge\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 27\nARTS\nTaking your pick of Picocon\nThis weekend is Imperial\u2019s 28th annual Sci-fi convention Picocon. Sci-fi fan Maciej\nMatuszewski gives a flavour of the talents of three of the authors attending\nI\nprefer science fiction to fantasy\nand so approached this novel with\nsome apprehension and reluc-tance. It follows Livak, a thief and\ngambler, who becomes embroiled in an\nattempt by a group of wizards to discover a lost form of magic, but which\neventually leads them to find a deadly\nnew enemy.\nInitially I found there was very little\nthat was remarkable about this book\nbut it was not long before I began to\nrealise that I was starting to care for the\ncharacters. They are varied, interesting,\noften morally ambiguous and mostly\nvery likable. From Livak herself, never\nfailing to do the right thing, to Darni,\noften gruff yet ultimately kind-hearted\nand a good friend. They draw the reader\ninto the story, which also leaves very\nlittle to be desired. It quickly picks up\nthe pace and is full of excitement and\nintrigue.\nOne of McKenna\u2019s greatest achievements in this novel is the setting, the\nworld of Einarinn. It is a detailed, complex place, with a fully fleshed out history and many distinct and interesting\ncountries. It is further explored in McKenna\u2019s many other books, to which \u201cThe\nThief\u2019s Gamble\u201d is a perfect introduc-tion.\nT\nhis is the first book in a long\ntime that I simply couldn\u2019t put\ndown. It is set in an alternate\nreality where, in the 60s, the\nUSA discovered the means to travel to\nother parallel universes.\nFor many years that America\u2019s version of the CIA had been sending agents\nto \u2018improve\u2019 the governments of other\nAmericas, a policy which is stopped\nby the election of a new president. One\nretired agent, however, is forced out of\nretirement to help capture one of his former colleagues, who has gone on an unexplained killing spree across a number\nof universes.\nThe story here is simply brilliant. The\nmystery is truly intriguing and you are\nnever quite sure of the characters\u2019 motivations until the very end. Many of the\nplot twists caught me completely off-guard and by surprise; none felt at all\ncontrived.\nThe plot might become slightly too\nconvoluted for some tastes in the second half but for me it just served to\nadd depth to the story. Those who stick\nwith the book will be rewarded with\nan ending that, while in keeping with\nthe somewhat ambiguous tone of the\npreceding chapters, still manages to be\ndeeply satisfying.\nK\nari Sperring\u2019s debut novel\nconcerns the planned destruction of the city of\nMerafi by its enemies\nthrough the use of magic, an art that has\nlong been forgotten there.\nA fascinating examination of a society\nalmost being brought to its knees by the\nunknown it features a disparate cast of\ncharacters whose different plot threads\nare masterfully brought together by the\nauthor. Sperring\u2019s experience as a mediaeval historian shines through as she\nhas managed to create a world which\nfeels very real, which is a major failing\nof many other fantasy writers.\nThe novel is somewhat slow paced\nbut that just allows for a closer look at\nthe issues involved, and for the characters to be given opportunity to develop,\ngiving the relatively simple storyline\ngreat depth. The plot feels both epic and\npersonally linked with each of these\ncharacters and this leads to a deeply\npoignant ending with a spectacular and\nclimactic feel. It certainly deserves to\nhave won the British Fantasy Society\u2019s\nSydney J Bounds Award for Best Newcomer.\nPicocon will be held at the Union on\nSaturday 19th from 10am, \u00a38\nY\nikes, despite the title, I\ndidn\u2019t exactly realise\nthat this was going\nto be exactly what it\nsays on the tin. Eve\nEnsler\u2019s all female and always controversial The Vagina Monologues\nsaw an adaptation by DramSoc on\nthree nights last week as part of\nSHAG Week events, and the taboo\nbusting subject matter had me\nshifting uncomfortably in my\nseat.\nWell, to begin with at least.\nWhile I might have remained\na little stony faced in the\nbeginning, fantastic performances from a more\nthan able cast pulled me\nstraight in and made me\nlisten to what had to\nbe said, raising downright belly laughs\nfrom me by the end.\nThe comfort and ease with which\nthe cast treated their material (which\nsome would call offensive) certainly\njarred at the start, but once things invariably settled down and showed off\na tremendous range of individual\nperformances and stories, I could\ncertainly appreciate the lasting appeal of the play, and\nthe joy of the Dramsoc\ncast and crew in the\ncreation of their\nown take on the\nproduction. The\nperformance itself\nhinged around\ncast members taking to the stage\nand giving a\nmonologue on a\nvaried range of\ntopics, written\nby Ensler (pictured) from amalgamations of personal interviews with around\n200 women. The breadth and mixture of\nsubject matter, ranging from light hearted yet detailed tales of birth, to truly\ngrim stories of horrendous female abuse\nin Bosnia surprisingly worked despite\nthe grand shifts in tone.\nThe performance was bolstered by an\nexceptional cast who really gave it their\nall, fully embodying the characters they\nwere representing, from elderly women\nto loud and proud sex workers. By the\nend of the latter\u2019s monologue, the audience was riotous with the sheer audacity\nof it all.\nWhether I agreed with the overall\nmessage of each monologue on offer or\nnot, each was performed admirably and\nallowed for some serious thought of the\nramification behind the role of language,\nperception and awareness of gender. A\nsure fire hit, then.\nIMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\u2019S\nVAGINA\nMONOLOGUES\nMatt Colvin\nThe Thief\u2019s Gamble\nby Juliet McKenna\nCowboy Angels\nby Paul McAuley\nLiving with Ghosts\nby Kari Sperring\nPaul McAuley is the BOSS\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "INTERVIEW\nFELIX\n8\nWould you say that you have been an\nactivist this year?\nYes, I have, but not in the general sense.\nI don\u2019t just jump on any bandwagon because it happens to be something other\npeople are getting excited about. I\u2019d like\nto think the Union is quite good at picking its fights carefully, if they need to be\nfought, but also in collaborating on some\nthings and realizing that some issues are\nbetter attacked in a different way.\nThe biggest thing that you\u2019ve been an\nactivist on is the Life Sciences cuts.\nWould you say that protests that were\nled by the Union were successful?\nIt depends how you measure it. We\nwere unsuccessful in changing the plans\nfor the restructure, which are now going\nahead. However, we were successful in\nmaking a lot of people in College, the\nmanagement side, realize that students\ndo care about their education, and I\nthink, even though they won\u2019t admit it,\nthey know the plans were badly thought\nthrough. On the other side, we were\nable to make those people that are being\nmade redundant, and other members of\nstaff, aware that students do care about\nthem, and care about the teaching they\nreceive.\nDoes the fact that you are from the\nLife Sciences department and you\ndid those courses have anything to do\nwith how vigorous the union\u2019s campaign was?\nIt meant that I was more clued up, as\nto exactly what was happening, and it\nLife Sciences cuts and\nStudent Protests\nprobably made my reaction better, in a\nway, because I knew what I was talking\nabout. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d be able to respond to any department if it was unjust\nlike that, and I think I\u2019ve shown that in\nthe PhD issues.\nAn area where you have explicitly\nstepped away from activism is the\ngovernment\u2019s cuts to higher educa-tion. Why did you decide not to engage with the demonstrations?\nThe first thing I heard about this was\nobviously during the summer when the\nNUS were planning their demonstration on the 10th November. There were\na few reasons why I was a little concerned about that \u2013 firstly I wasn\u2019t really\nsure what its goals were. Obviously it\nwas to highlight student unrest, but the\nmain issue seemed to be the complaint\nagainst rising fees, and then tagged onto\nthat was to complain about the government cuts. Obviously those are two related things, but they\u2019re going to make\ncuts regardless of what we say. They\nknow that students don\u2019t want them to\nmake cuts to higher education \u2013 it\u2019s a no\nbrainer.\nSo the reason not to march on the\nstreet is that you don\u2019t think it would\nchange the debate?\nYeah, firstly I don\u2019t believe it would\nhave an effect, but that\u2019s not necessarily a reason not to go and demonstrate\n\u2013 people go and demonstrate for a lot\nof things that they don\u2019t think they\u2019re\ngoing to have an effect on. The reason\nI didn\u2019t put my time into it is because\nwe were elected as a Union to help the\nstudents at Imperial. I don\u2019t think that\nit\u2019s within our remit to spend a long time\nprotesting (some sabbatical officers at\nsome universities literally spend their\nentire time doing this \u2013 organizing protests against cuts). Of course, I wouldn\u2019t\ndiscourage students if they wanted to\nprotest; we put the NUS demonstration\nin the full student email.\nDo you see a parallel between the campaign to stop the cuts to the life sciences department and the campaigns\nto stop the cuts to higher education\nfunding, which also affects Imperial?\nWell it\u2019s interesting that, a lot of people\nhave said that, and in a way of course\nyou can see a parallel: why would you\nbe lethargic about cuts on one hand and\nnot on the other? It goes back to what I\nsaid just now, that actually it is within\nour remit to try and find a better way to\naddress the changes in Life Sciences.\nActually we never said there shouldn\u2019t\nbe a Life Sciences restructure, we just\nsaid that if you are going to restructure,\nand if you really have to get rid of people\nin that way, and of course it\u2019s horrible,\nyou have to consider every metric, you\ncan\u2019t just look at research, that was the\nentire point. The other thing is that they\nare two completely different situations,\nif you look at it on a UK political level,\nyes, the country is in a massive deficit,\nand has a huge amount of debt. But Imperial doesn\u2019t \u2013 it could easily keep the\nLife Sciences department running at a\ndeficit while they reduced it over time.\nImperial have enough money to do that.\nBut Britain doesn\u2019t, you could argue.\nSome people argue that the government doesn\u2019t need to make cuts on the\nscale that they are making.\nThat\u2019s a very good point, and I\u2019m perfectly happy to get into a debate with\nany student about this. However, I\ndon\u2019t think I should be spending my\nelected time as a sabbatical officer of\na student union of one university trying to engage with the government on\nUK-wide cuts \u2013 I don\u2019t think it is what\nI was elected for. There are a lot of issues going on within Imperial that we\ncan help deal with, and that we have\nhelped deal with.\nIn terms of how you see your role,\nwhy is it right for the Union not to\nengage in these national issues when\nmany other student Unions do?\nI think that Imperial students should\nengage\u2026\n\u2026But if the students should engage,\nwhy shouldn\u2019t their student union\nhelp and encourage them to engage?\nHelping them to engage is different\nto actively encouraging them. We did\nhelp them to engage, we didn\u2019t ignore\nthe debate by any means, we had the\ndebate in council, we had the debate\nin Felix, people emailed in, and we are\nright now having a follow up debate\nabout the bursaries and fees in college,\nand I\u2019m trying to publish them as much\nas possible. We\u2019ve certainly helped\npeople get involved. With regards to\nsupporting them to take a particular political viewpoint, no I don\u2019t think that is\nthe Union\u2019s responsibility.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\nit\u2019s in our remit to\nspend a long time\nprotesting.\u201d\n\u201cCourses cost money\nand the courses\nat Imperial are\nespecially expensive.\u201d\nMiles Robertson\nHe fought the Life\nSciences cuts but\nsupports higher\nfees: Alex Kendall\non why he picks his\nfights carefully\nThe College has now decided to increase fees to \u00a39,000 subject to con-ditions, and that\u2019s something you\nsupport?\nYes. Firstly there is a big gap in the\nnational debate at the moment, which\nis rightly focusing on the fact that to\ncharge more than \u00a36,000 universities have to show a certain amount of\ncommitment to access. Now obviously\nI completely agree with that, but the\ndebate hasn\u2019t focused at all on how\nactually some universities might have\nto charge \u00a39,000 because their courses\ncost that much. Courses cost money and\nthe courses at Imperial are especially\nexpensive. By increasing the fees to\n\u00a39,000, those from lower incomes will\nhave a much greater bursary scheme\navailable to them, and it\u2019s quite exciting\nhow much bigger this will be. Unfortunately there can\u2019t be any announcements until the government specifies its\nrequirements on access.\nIs it better to reduce student debt or to\noffer cash during the course?\nThis is the debate about how the bursa-ries are going to be targeted. There are\ntwo ways. We give students fee waiv-ers, where they don\u2019t have a choice\nabout how to spend that bursary money.\nYou just take it off the debt. Or you give\nit to them up front in cash. We want to\nsurvey the 27% of Imperial students\n\u00a39,000 Fees\nFriday 18 february 2011\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 7\nFEATURE\nA\nfew weeks ago, many people were saddened to hear\nthat Martin Milligan, who\nmany knew as the man\nwho sold the Big Issue in\nthe South Kensington pedestrian tunnel,\nhad passed away.\nPeople flustered by the morning commute who would usually put their head\ndown and stride past a homeless per-son, would stop to talk to Martin, buy a\nBig Issue from him, offer him food. He\nwas part of people\u2019s lives and he will be\nmissed by many.\nIn our daily lives it is not uncommon\nfor us to see rough sleepers around London. Even though they are there, many\nof us see through them or avert our gaze\nwhen walking past. But the truth is we are\nnot seeing the bigger problem of home-lessness; the hidden homeless of London.\nAccording the 1996 Housing Act a\nperson is classified as homeless when\nthey have no accommodation that they\nare entitled to occupy, or they have ac-commodation, but it is not reasonable\nfor them to continue to occupy this ac-commodation.\nDespite not living on the streets,\nmany people meet the legal definition of\nhomelessness. These people can spend\ntheir lives bouncing from hostel to hos-tel, sleeping at Bed and Breakfasts or be\nliving in overcrowded houses.\nHomeless charity Crisis carried out research in 2004 in an attempt to find out\nthe extent of the homeless problem in\nthe UK. The figures are staggering.\nAround 800,000 people are estimated\nto be homeless. Worringly, half of these\npeople are described as the \u2018hidden\nhomeless\u2019. These people, despite being\ntechnically homeless, have no been provided with accomadation either because\nthey are \u2018not a priority\u2019 or they have not\nbeen officially classifed as homeless.\nThis includes people who sleep rough.\nMany of the hidden homeless are defined as \u2018single homeless people\u2019; this\nsimply means that they have no children\nor dependents, and therefore are not\nsuch a priority to for councils to house.\nHowever, these people are often among\nthe most vulnerable people in society;\nfor example, people who have left a\nviolent partner or those who are dealing\nwith mental health issues.\nThose that can often slip through the\nnet are the younger generation of home-less, those under the age of 25, our peers.\nHow many people have heard of a friend\nsofa surfing whilst trying to find a permanent place to stay? Or having to stay with\nfamily temporarily? Well, those friends\nare technically homeless. This is a stressful situation that thousands of young men\nand women are currently living through.\nAs far as the government is concerned,\nonce you\u2019re 18, they are not responsible\nfor arranging accomadation for you. For\nstudents in this situation, the first port of\ncall should be the university accomoda-tion office. After graduating, contacting\nthe local council is the best way of getting referred to a hostel.\nUnfortunately, for many, sleeping on a\nmate\u2019s sofa is not an option. The people\nsleeping rough in the UK are the most\nobvious face of homelessness - the person next to your tube stop who you pass\non your way home every night or the\nDedication to\nMartin from\nLovena at\nPandora\n\u201cBut the truth is we\nare not seeing the\nbigger problem; the\nhidden homeless of\nLondon\u201d\npeople offering you Big Issues on your\ndaily commute.\nSt Mungo\u2019s deals with those who have\nrun out of options and find themselves\non the streets. Judith Higgin from the\nTrust told us that helping people who\nare sleeping rough isn\u2019t just about putting a roof over their heads. \u201cHomelessness isn\u2019t just about housing. It\u2019s about\nthe situation that leads to it, be that mental health problems, family breakdown,\nsubstance abuse. Those things can spiral\nout of control quite quickly.\u201d\nMost people who end up in hostels like\nthis stay for around eighteen months, during which time they can get help with education and training that could help them\nback on their feet. But many of them also\nhave mental health problems, which hostels and charities have to tackle.\nData from CHAIN, a database managed by the Broadway Homeslessness\nand Support charity, shows that 35%\nof London\u2019s rough sleepers have mental health problems. These can be the\ncause of people finding themselves on\nthe streets in the first place. But they can\nalso be caused by the strains and stresses\nof sleeping rough.\nIntertwined with this issue is drug and\nalcohol abuse, which can be a cause or a\nconsequence of homelessness.\nIt\u2019s really easy to become homeless,\nbut really hard to get out of once you get\nthere. That\u2019s why charities and hostels\nneed your support. You can either give\nmoney to charities, or volunteer to help\nout at a hostel or soup kitchen.\nImperial student Katy Bettany volunteered with Holy Trinity Brompton\nat St Pauls, Onslow Square. She had to\npersevere to get through the checks, getting a CRB and a reference from a priest\nthrough her church.\nBut to her, it was worth it. \u201cHomelessness is something that really upsets me,\nso it was nice to be able to do something\ntangible to help.\u201d\nAlthough it is easy to paint homeless\npeople according to a stereotype, Katy\nfound the people she worked with full of\nsurprises. \u2018One of the guys just sat down\nat the piano, and he turned out to be the\nmost amazing pianist. I just don\u2019t understand how someone that talented ended\nup on the streets.\u2019\nThe \u2018hidden homeless\u2019\nLovena Chettiyer shares her\nthoughts and memories about\nMartin Milligan.\nI\u2019ve known Martin for the past\n8 years, he was like a father to\nme. He was a retired English\nand Latin teacher, he was originally from Edinburgh.\nMartin had a caring and kind\nnature. He was very thoughtful and would go out of his\nway to help people.Martin was\nvery much loved by all of us\nat Pandora [a designer dress\nagency], he was like our agony\nuncle.\nHe was great at giving us\nfashion advice as he had a\ngood eye.\nMy favourite memory of Martin was when he spent Christmas with me and a couple of\nfriends in 2009. We had a delightful evening and shared a\nlot jokes, he later went on to\ntell everyone that it was one of\nthe best Christmas he had for\na very long time. He was a bit\ndubious about my lamb roast\nat the beginning as he never\nbelieved I could cook.\nMartin had a very dry and\nsarcastic sense of humor.\nPandora will never be the\nsame without Martin, his absence is deeply felt by all of\nus.\nLizzie Crouch and Anna Perman remember Martin Milligan and\nlook deeper into the problem of homelessness in the UK\nMarie Chkaiban\nFlowers have been left in remembrance on Exhibition road\nFriday 18 february 2011\n\n"
