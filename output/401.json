    "content": "mix9 Reviews Concerts\nStackridge and Sparrow in the Great\nHall\nAfter the Lord Mayor's Show comes\n...Stackridge.\nBid adieu to the Stackridge of old.\nLast Saturday's gig in the Great Hall saw amish mash of the old and the new.\nThe saying \" You can't teach an old dog\nnew tricks\" sprang to my mind halfway\nthrough their set \u2014 it seemed appropriate\nat the time. All this was a pity, as the\nsupport band, a chirp y little outfit called\n\" Sparrow\", had done enough to set the\nscene for a really astral (one up on\ncosmic) concert.\nSparrow are a useful five man band\nwho are obviously never going to make it\nbig, but will a i ways go down well in\nclubs or as support acts. Their act is a little too polished, and they had an\nannoying habit of all going \" doo wah\" at the end of a number-ugh! Musically they showed tremendous versatility \u2014\nthe lead guitarist can \" really lay down\nsome mean tracks, man\"( from the row\nbehind me).\nThey sound like an up-dated Barron\nKnights - what do you mean, who's Barron Knights? They did sing some of\ntheir own compositions and one called\" O Doctor\", which is out now and\n\" bud dling in the 2 0 0 ' s\", was very\nenjoyable.\nOne of the highlights of the evening\nwas their rendition of some Beach Boys\nmelodies which they did with marvelous\nharmon is ation. They ended the set with a medley of \" oldies but goodies\" which\nhad a stomping finish. Tn is had the\naudience clam our ing for more and so we\nhad an encore! \" Great\", I thought.\nObviously the band were either under\norders to get off quick and stop hogging\nthe limelight, or they only new one other\nsong, either way it was unfortunate that\nwe were subjected to a truly nauseating\npiece dating from those sugary days of\nthe all-American kid called\" Graduation Day\". This is definitely not one for\nlistening to - to quote the lady(?) on my\nright, \" It's the Mike Summers Singers\". Nonetheless, a good set from Sparrow.\nAnd so the Stack ridge\". Having done\nmy best to get high on Swan lager\n(Australian goats piddle), I sat back,\ngirdled my loins, and waited to be\nzonked out.\nThe Band, overall, were too loud,\nand seemed to fall into the trap which so many \" big\" bands do. The assumption\nthat everyone in the audience knows the\nwords to the songs and that, therefore,\nwe do not have to hear them at the\nconcert. This is invalid, especially in a time of high inflation \u2014 that Is,\nwhen records are bloody expensive. We\ncould hear every word of Sparrow's set.\nNot so with Stackridge.\nBeyond this general comment, their\nold songs, light-hearted \" soft\" rock,\nwere great. \" Fish in a Glass\" featured\nsome lovely sax playing while \" GoodLooking\" had most people tapping\ntheir feet lightly on the floor. Their\nmusical pieces were interesting \u2014\nnot being vocal, one did not have to\ntry and pick up the words.\n\" Slater' s Waltz\" began with a quiet\npiano solo, then gradually in came sax,\nguitar and mellotron. All in all, quite\nbreathtaking. On the other hand,\n\" Coniston Water\", in which we were\nasked to visualise\" the waves lapping\non the shore\", the trees in the wind\", and a tramp having * * \u2022 * , was a failure.\nPink Floyd play this sort of stuff\nsome what better, and borrowing some\nof the rifts from Crimson's\"\" Lizard\" did not 'exactly endear itself- to yours\ntruly. The encore was- a rous ii fg version\nof \" Your Mother Should Know\". More\nlike it would have been appreciated.\nOn the whole then, Sparrow played\nwell \u2014 Stackridge were also present.\nRecords\nBruce Springsteen - \"Born to Run\" (C Before putting record to turntable,\nBruce Springsteen was just an American\nsong smith to me who, by all accounts, had\nthe prospect of a big future as the rev it ali sed successor to Dylan. He was\nsigned to CBS by John Hammond who\nintroduced such artists as Billie Holiday\nBob Dylan, and Aretha Franklin to the\nmusic public, so if past experience and\npresent expenditure on the promotion of\nSpringsteen is anything to go by, great\nthings are expected in the next few years.\nOnce, in the grooves, the initial impact\nare the raspy vocals - a mixture of Roger\nChapman, Joe Cocker and at times Lee\nMarvin; if a sufficiently-efficient groin-squeezer could be produced. The opening\ntrack, \" Thunder road\" resembles the\nearly ' Little Feat' product \u2014 simple\ntrucking music with primitive beat and\n.light, Tonky piano - No frills. It's quickly apparent that whatever strength\nthe songs have lies in the lyrics rather\nthan the music, which remains relatively\npedestrian throughout the album apart\nfrom the occasional sax or piano filler.\nThe lyrics on the other hand, much in the\nDylan mould, are strong and well-balanced\nto carry across the intended punk/street\nlife ambience with maximum clarity and\nforce.\nAt first there seems strong evidence\nto suggest that Roy Bittan is the first fully\nprogrammable keyboards player, so\nmonotonous is his contribution for the\nbulk of the record, but life seems evident\nwhen he very occassional ly steps outside\nthe beat. Indeed the best moments are\nconsistently the first few bars of each\ntrack, where some scope is provided for\ninvention before the all-consuming beat\nmoves in to render inactive any possible\nfinesse that might germinate.\n\"Blackstreets\" already V \u00bb into side\n1, provides the first punch of the album,\nwith lines spat rather than sung, and a pianist who finally starts to play. This is\nfollowed, on side 2, by the title-track and\ncurrent single but remains the same old\nstory - good lyrics, mediocre music. The\nfirst taste to appear does so painfully late\non \"Meeting across the river\", where a softer, more complete song, filled with\nimaginative musicianship emerges,\ncarried along on a wave of piano and\nguitar. For superior quality than the\nranting s of previous numbers .\"Jungle-land\", the closer, is also impressive \u2014\nfine lyrics we j dad to a substantial rocker\nproviding the best sax solo of the set.\n\"Born to run\" is an album of evocative,\npungent lyrics set to unexceptional music\nby an artist tipped to be one of CBS' s major money spinners. For those who\nwant to crown a new Dylan, be it on their\nown heads, because essentially Bruce\nSpringsteen is a product of their making.\nClimax Blues Band: Stamp Album (BTM)\nThere is always a difference between\ngroups who play and sing their own\nsongs and those who are just vocal\ngroups like Faith Hope and Charity. The Climax Blues Band have blended\ntogether a good and exciting new\nsound which can only be described\nas soul-rock.\nThe guitar work on the first track,\n'Using the power', on side one of this\nalbum is as good as some I 've heard\non what is usually described as hard-rock records.\nThe album is full of good solid ry th ms and this is more than reflected\nin the second track, 'Mr Goodtime'.\nThis track shows the group at\ntheir most innovative \u2014 a completely\nnew sound In soul which extends and\namplifies the use of instrumentation\nand the basic vocals/ry th m combination\nof this genre. Their music seems to\nbe drawn from all the best schools of\njazz, rock, blues, sould and rock' n' roll The jazzy type rock is expressed In\n'/ am Constant' which tails off\nbeautifully in a kind of ragtime blues\nsound.\nFor sheer delightful funk, however,\none has to listen to 'Running out of\ntime'.\nThe second track on side two 'Rusty\nNail/The Devil Knows' is aptly named -being toned down with an introduction\nof soul ry th ms. The next track, ' Loosen up', bears absolutely no resemblance to\nthe other songs on the album. It sounds\nmore like a rag-time blues number\nthat's been stripped of its basic soul\norigins. 'Spirit Returning' is more reminiscent\nof the recent soft soul era that seems to\nhave faded for the moment. This track\nhas somewhat more depth and should\ncatch on In discos If anyone ever\ncares to play It.\nOn the whole the second side is\na disappointment after the first side\nIn which the group really excelled. The\nnoticeable thing about the album is\nthe way In which the music revolves\nround the instruments which are well played. It is almost as If they are\nspeaking out the music.\nContinued on page 10\n\n"

Papers submitted must deal with one or\nmore aspects of fruit juices (eg chemistry, technology,\neconomics, nutrition, legal aspects etc), may not be longer\nthan 6,000 words and must be typed in one of the Congress\nlanguages (English, French, Italian or German) on one side\nof the page only, using double spacing and having a wide\nmargin at the sides. The jury is composed of members\nof the Scientific-Technical Commission of th e International\ninternational Federation of Fruit Juice Producers and Its\ndecisions are final. The six best papers will be published\nin the Congress Proceedings. The authors of the three best\npapers will be invited to attend the Congress.\nParticipants resident in Great Britain, who must be\nyounger than 25 on May 1, 1976. are invited to send their\npapers to Dr I Vi Heech, Research Station, Long Ashton,\nBristol, BS18 9 AF, before January 15, 1976. Successful\ncandidates will be notified individually before March 1, 1976.\nTelix\nRefectories\n\"Speciality of the house: vast piles of grey, mushy\nchips\". That is the opinion of the Sennet reporter, John\nRyan, when he visited the refectories at IC.\" In fact, in\nthe survey which covered four other colleges and UL U, we come out bottom of the list.\nIt is for this very reason that the refectories are suffering\nfrom a decrease in turnover thus making it almost certain\nthat there will be a further increase in refectory prices at\nChristmas. Or will the College take the drastic step of\nclosing one of the refectories? If so which one? The Union\nLower Refectory?\nThere has been a lot of talk, most of it sensible, if\nsomewhat impracticable, on the ways we might try to\nsolve the refectories problem. One s nch idea, was put\nforward by Mr Williams (see FELIX no. 399). I agree that\nif there existed an air of mutual co-operation between the\nopposing factions then we would have a basis for progress.\nI. further agree that the Union, in the person of Mr Teague\nappears to be defeatist in its attitude to the problem.\nHowever, I would contend that Mr Teague and other leaders\nof this Union enjoy grass-roots support. Where were the\ngrass-roots at the first UGM of this session when the\nrefectories problem was being discussed?\nI feel that a solution to this problem would be for the\nUnion to take over the running of the Union refectory.\nIt could then employ an outside catering concern to run it\nand charge prices that would compete with Mr Mooney's prices. This would thus break the monopoly that Mr Mooney\nhas on the catering in this College.\nI look forward to seeing some reaction to this idea.\nHalls of Residence\nMr Te.ague in his 'Peter Patter' last week asked for\nsome reaction to bis comments on refectories and halls of\nresidence cleaning. I am glad to see that there has been\nsome response (see latter s to the editor, page 6), albeit\nonly a meagre one. Although I would lend my support to\nthe suggestions put forward by our two correspond ants this week, the matter is not so easily resolved. The\nsuggestion that we cut down on cleaning would mean' a reduction in cleaning staff and as far as I am aware the\nother Union involved, N UP E, has not been consulted as\nyet regarding this. But this does not detract from the fact\nthat students in halls of residence get it too damn good.\n\n"

However, the album kick-offs with\ntheir latest single 'Nights on Broadway'\nwhich has not yet Droken into MM's singles Chart but is climbing through the\nUS singles chart. I would say that this\ntrack was far superior to the former\nalthough not quite In the same disco classic class. Still, on with the album, 'Wind of\nChance' is a very pleasant track still carrying the overtones of funk which\nunderlay most of the album with the\nexception of Songbird' which is a typical top of the pops average smooch y. The most beautiful, pleasant and\ncontemporary song on the album is\n'Fanny (be tender with my love)'. It\nis musically the most developed. It\nemploys an exhilarating mixture of\nvocals from within the group which is\nwell executed.\nAfter dismissing the first track on\nside two \u2014 It probably went to their\nheads with a title like 'All This Making\nLove'! the rest of this side can be\nFELIX\ndescribed as quite good. 'Country\nLanes' takes one back to when they\nhad 'Massuchusetts' as a hit single\nand It Is surprising that with variation\nin arrangement the fundamental sound\nhas not aged very much.\nIn fact after the first side they completely shake off the funky side\npreviously prevalent and slide into\ntheir more conventional style although\nthey have Improved tremendously In this\nsphere. Certainly if I had to recommend\nany of the above three albums, I would rec commend this one as the\nbest value overall. Indeed, it is quite\ndifferent experience of the Bee Gees\nat possibly their best.\nFaith Hope & Charity: Faith Hope &\nCharity (RCA)\n'Let's Go to the Disco' where the\nmusic is out of sight sing this trio of\ntwo females and one male and by some\nstrange coincidence he is Hope. Well,\nI only got as far as my room to listen\nto this album which is produced, arranged\nand conducted by Van ' Hustle' McCoy. It's certainly full of good things but\nsuffers from chronic superficiality and\ncommercialism. The tracks worthy of\nnote are the first two on side one viz; 'Let's Go to the Disco' 'Just One Look'\n'Disco Dan and 'To Each His Own' are\nalso quite good especially the latter\nwhich is currently making it at the\nnumber one spot in the US soul top 20.\nHowever, this is not surprising since\nMcCoy uses a re-has f ted version of\nthe ' Hustle' arrangement in it. Certainly\nthe Hustle ry th ms are most noticeable\nthroughout but on ' To Each His Own'\nthe temptation proves to be too much.\nThis album is unlikely to make it in\nBritain although some of the tracks\nif released as singles stand a very\ngood chance and in this category one\nwould include 'Mellow Me' an exciting\nsong with good use of the vocal talent of the group \u2014 they definitely do not\nlack in this field.

    "content": "mix Utfan to tfa i EMfoi\nThe Future Sir, \u2014 Friday evening should\nhave been restful, but then I read Lord Rothschild's speech in FELIX400! The kindest descriptions\nof it would be \" silly\", or\n\" childish\", or perhaps\n\" naive\". But can one apply\nsuch terms, without censure,\nto the public pronouncements\nof so important a figure in our\nestablishment? I think not.\nFor it Is troubling to suspect\nsuch limited awareness in a man Of influence. Let me\nsummarise my reactions.\n\" The Future\"( title of\nthe speech) is a matter not\njust of interest, as it has\nalways been, but of profound\nand fundamental concern on\nthe part of a great many\npeople. The prospects for\nhumanity, or indeed the\nbiosphere, seem bleak indeed,\nand a speech which failed to\ninject humour or compassion\ninto the subject might at\nleast have afforded it a more\nserious and mature consideration. As it was we\nwere presented with various\ntechnocrat i codd ment s, real\nimagined, such as \" ext as in\", a pleasure drug, or (another\ntravesty of a serious matter)\na dabble Jn the implications\nof genetic engineering.\nThe major \" focus\" seemed\nto be population growth. While\nI am no great expert on this\nsubject, I did participate In the\nWorld Population Conference\nin Bucharest last year, and\nin several preceding conferences on population,\nand I would at least claim to\nbe familiar with the works of\nexperts in this field, as well as with the feelings of\nactivists in organisations\nconcerned with population\nphenomena in Britain and\nabroad. From this viewpoint,\nLord Rothschild's words\nseem nothing short of crass. Producing and caring for\nchildren is a most intimate\nand precious part of human\nlife, and the problems of\ngrowth and distribution of the\ntotal population is not helped\nor clarified by de human ising it through absurd and emotive\nextrapolations of growth rates.\nTHE C Hier ErvfG-l ME Ef t.6EAMS C \u00ab PT N. CORK t DOC \u2022 DC A A/N TO A MEW\" j,'| \u2022\n\u2022\njpL ft Nr r....j^$/7 J; TH ft T DKuKJUEK)',\nIn fact I would assert that the\n\" numbers\" approach is\nbankrupt, both morally and as\na. help in defining what Is\nmeant by a population problem,\nor even \" the\" population\nproblem.\nThe rest of my reactions\nform a rag-bag of a set that\nseems finite but unbounded:\nthe specious beginning \u2014\n\"The most important members\nof this audience have only\nrecently started their adult\nlives\"; the pompous vacuity\n\u2014 eg \"...the H bomb, which,\nincidentally, I predict will\nnot intentionally be used in\nyour lifetime\" - whew!, thanks Lord R, and to think\nS'd been worrying about it all this time!; and so it goes on \u2014\nthese extracts are just from\nthe first two paragraphs.\nMay I finish on the good\nLord's level, by speculating\nthat he' d taken a drug which\nhe forgot to mention: \" Non s in\", the effects of which are\nrevealed by the speech. The\nquestion Is, should it be\nbanned?\nYours sincerely,\nJOHN SHADE, Physics PG Sir, \u2014 A number of people\nseem to entertain the idea\nthat a solution to the wo-id's population problem lies in the\nexport of people to somewhere\noff this planet.\nI was very glad to see\nthat Lord Rothschild in his Commemoration day speech,\nThe Future, printed in FELIX issue. no. 400'., strongly\nindicated the absurdity of this\nnotion, at least for a long\ntime to come. I would like\nto drive the point home with\nsome simple calculations. Let us be very optimistic\nand suppose that the. growth\nof the present world's population of around 4000\nmillion is reduced to 1%\nper year. That means 40\nmillion, yes forty mi iI ion,\nnew people. In one year.\nThat means 110 thousand a day or about 4600 chaps\nand cha pet tes born every\nhour.\nTry getting rid of that\nlot; it's some logistical\nproblem!!\nYours faithfully,\nDORI SCHM ETT ERLING. Dept of Chemistry.\nCleaning Sir, \u2014 Since Peter Teague is\nawaiting a reaction to his column of the 7th of November:\nhere it is. r Having collected as many\nopinions as possible on the\nhall of residence matter,\nI feel that most students\nwould be quite happy having\ntheir rooms cleaned only\nonce a week and making\ntheir own beds, pr<\u00ab.'i ding this would cut the cost of\nresidence. The prices paid\nin our halls are not high\nby London standards; but\nit seems a pity to waste money\non a function which is largely\nunnecessary, instead of\nleaving it in the students'\npocket.\nYours faithfully,\n1st year,\nDivision of Life Science\nSir, \u2014 I am writing in response\nto Peter Teague's article in\nFELIX No.400 regarding the\neffect the cleaning staff's wages have on hall bills. It. seems to me that one\ncleaner per landing is a luxury most students cannot\nafford. I would suggest one\ncleaner per staircase per hall, thus cutting the cleaners and\ntheir wage bill to a third at a stroke. The cleaners duties\nshould be reduced to polishing\nor^hoover ing the floor of each\nof the three landings once a week. The three sets of\ntoilets, shower and bath\nwould still be cleaned daily as at present. The cleaners\ncould also collect up dirty\nlinen and distribute the clean\nones.\nStudents would then dust\ntheir rooms, clean their\nsinks, and make their own\nbeds. Once a week, dirty\nlinen should be left folded on\nthe corners of the bed ready\nfor collection by the cleaners.\nThe students would then\nremake their beds with the\nclean linen.\nI do not think th a' an v of\nthe above suggestions would\neither take mu6h effort or take\nup much of the students' time,\nnor would the workload of the\nstaircase cleaner by any\ngreater than that of either of\nthe present landing cleaners.\nYours sincerely,\nRSL WILKS.316 Falmouth Hall, Bar prices\nSir, \u2014 It is with some concern\nthat I note that the bar prices\nare about to be Increased\nonce again.\nOver the past two years\nwe have seen a steady erosion\nin the price differential\nbetween the College Bars and\nlocal Public Houses. This latest price rise has produced\nthe situation whereby this\ndifferential has become\nnegligible or even in some\ncases, non-existent. In an\neffort to maximise profits\nand thus offset any refectory\ndeficit, the Bar Committee\nhave opted for the I ay mans\nway out, missing the point\nthat prices and turnover are\ninter-related. It is by no\nmeans certain that higher\nprices will produce a higher\nprofit. Indeed sales are\na I ready down on the corresponding period last\nsession. Students will no\nlonger travel Into College for\na drink on the basis of price\nalone.\nIt is also time to point out\nthat the large -number of\noutside bookings going through\nthe College enjoy the privilege\nof drinking at 'the normal IC\nrates. Surely if the profits are\nto be Increased then the non-College persons utilising the\nbars should be called upon to\npay a realistic price after\ndinner services. I would urge the Bar Committee, and especially the student representatives to\nrecon sj der the pricing policies By looking for Increased\nprofits from the students they\nare In danger of killing the\nbars and turning last year's small profit Into a loss.\nI remain Sir, your obedient\nservant,\nKEITH N AHLERS President C& GU.

Attendence was rather disappointing,\nbut six amendments were produced and most of the motions\ndiscussed. These amendments have now gone to the NUS.

Tabled by Strathclyde and Edinburgh Universities Conference notes: i)' that NUS is a federal body within which each CO is an autonomous unit. ii) that the body elected to implement national policy decided by COs is the Executive and that this is accountable to National Conference for all it does. iii) the beginning of an orchestrated attack on SU funding by government both as part of education cuts, and as an attempt to limit the powers of students in opposing those cuts. iv) that this attack is being complemented and made credible by accusations from some quarters that unions\" mis \u2014 spend\" money, because they are und emc or a tic. Conference believes: i) that direct democracy is the strength of NUS in that it is participatory and encourages the maximum involvement of membership in most cases. ii) the significant gains that have been made over the past five years area result of NUS actively campaigning on this basis. iii) that at national level, in most cases union GMs are the sovereign body of the union, and that it is the alibi lit y to become involved in debate and decision making which develops union consciousness and are the mark of a democratic union. iv) that active participation and involvement are essential if students are to be successful in the campaigns which have just been launched. v) the NUS is one of the most democratic e organisations of its kind. Conference affirms: i) its commitment at all levels to direct democracy and active participation of the membership which is best served by all delegates being directly elected by all members of the constituent bodies. ii) its opposition to methods which seek to by \u2014 pass mass involvement and which result in bureaucracy and career is min union affairs. iii) its commitment to two national delegate conferences a year in order to instruct and control the Executive. Conference categorically declares: that in the fight to oppose cutbacks in the attacks on union finance, the traditions of direct involvement in decision making and action will be the critical factor.

    "content": "FF.LIX 5\nPOOH'S CO*1M \u00a3ft\nRefectory prices : The\nCynics are Defeatists\nIn my article on refectories two weeks ago (\"The\nRefectory Price Syndrome: Trust is needed\"), I suggested\ntentative proposals which, if endorsed by the College\nand the Students Union in a spirit of unprecedented\ncooperation, might ease the refectory price escalation\n(not \"solve the refectory economic crisis at a stroke\"\nas one 'silly billy' (if you'll forgive the pun) put it)\nand improve the quality ot the meals and the service\navailable in the refectories, especially Southside. I sketched out a rough embryo of an idea declaring that\nit would still need to be developed by both the College\nand the Union officials if it were to emerge as a mutually viable proposition.\nI am pleased to record the grounds we lI of support\nfor the idea amongst not only IC students (-some of\nthose who approached me were total strangers) but\nalso the College refectory staff, the Bar staff and\nthe highest echelons of the College administration.\nI further stated \"Doubtless smug little cynics ...\nwill point out the difficulties.\" Mr Peter Teague and\nMr Bill Gerrard (see FELIX last week) have clearly\nidentified themselves as such. Frankly, I am sickened\nby their defeatism'.\nMr Gerrard s ambitious \"repudiation\" is a moche ry of fact when he says \"Mr Teague put the basic idea\nMr Williams was suggesting to these people last\nsummer! V This is just not true'. Did Mr Teague at\nthat time offer to campaign to fill the refectories if\nthe College kept the prices down? No. Therein lies the\nvital difference. Mr Teague and the other leaders of\nthis Union have the power to do this because they\nenjoy the grass-roots support of this Union. It is\ntherefore almost the ultimate carrot to dangle in front\nof the College. It's an excellent bargaining standpoint\nand I wonder if Peter realised this when he discussed\nthe matter with the College last summer; I wonder if he\nrealises this now. After all, in order to negotiate\nsuccessfully one has to have something of value, to offer.\nIt is up to the Union's leadership to recognise that\nit does have something to bargain with.\nAs for Mr Gerrard's idealogical objections, I am\nunable to endorse his philo sph ical pretensions. When\nthe whole of the education sector is under financial\nattack from the government, I believe that it is\ninappropriate to look at Imperial College as an Us v. Them (ie Union v. College) kind of confrontation.\n\"College provides the refectory service, so it's up\nto them to solve its problems\" - this is an attitude\nI cannot support. The NUS is telling Student Unions to\nstand together with local Trade Unions so that they (the\nStudent Unions) will be able to apply greater pressure\nto the Colleges and Universities. Has anyone ever\nthought of standing together with the Colleges and\nUniversities themselves. For that is exactly what I believe this Union should be doing. Often in the past\n(take Norm Sayles\" year as President, for example)\nthe Union has approached the College practically cap\nin hand asking for this, that and the other. More often\nthan not, College has coughed up the goods. So isn't it about time that this Union began to show its\nappreciation just a little, instead of spiking it with\nnails and recklessly perpetuating the refectory\naccount loss?\nSorry, Mr Gerrard. I'm unconvinced. I must however\napplaud the fact that you are prepared to air your\nviews explicitly and foster discussion on this\ncontroversial issue.\nMr Teague on the other hand appears to have\nadopted a disappointingly low profile on the subject.\nI am glad to see that he does not want the refectories\nto be closed. Pity he cannot recognise that he is\naccelerating things to that situation. We appear\nto agree that the first obstacle is the quality of food.\nFair enough. But just because Mr Mooney refuses to\nadmit that there is room for improvement in Southside\nmeals does not surely mean the end of the matter. II believe that this Union is entitled to expect from its\nelected leadership some determination and a measure\nof negotiating ability. This Union should not have to\ntolerate .such morbidity as \"Well I'm sorry, but Mr\nMooney refuses to admit that the food served in Southside is below par, so there's little we can really do.\"\nThat is just shying away at the first fence because\nif looks a little high. If Mr Teague could convince the\nRector that Southside food is substandard, do you\nbelieve that Mr Mooney would stick to his story? Try\nit and see.\nWhen one of the refectories does close, it will be\nprincipally IC students who will suffer as well as\nthe associated refectory staff who will lose their\njobs. Today's defeatists will turn to the College, say\n\"It is your fault for making excessive price increases\"\nand waggle their fingers at Mr Mooney. tie in turn will\nface this Union and say \"It's your own fault for\npinching my customers. You have succeeded in making\nstaff redundant and seriously inconveniencing your\nown Union members.\" Give it some thought. Write and\ntell FELIX what you think.\nAnd as for JJ Stuart of Maths 1, write on!\nMIKE WILLIAMS\nMutters\nArising\nThe Haldane Library and\nthe Union\nDid you know that the\nUnion supplies the cash for\nthe buying of \" file under\npopular\" records and fictional\nrecreational books?

    "content": "HOCKEY Imperial College 2\nEttessa 4\nIn suffering the first\nleague defeat this season,\nIC played their best hockey\nthis term, although two\ndefensive errors cost them\nthe match. Et tessa, who\nhave scored on average five\ngoals per game in the League,\nstarted the match as this\nform suggests, showing\nsharpness in attack. After\nten minutes they were given\na penalty which was easily converted. At this point IC\nwoke up and started\ncon ten sting the control of\nmidfield and beginning to\nput pressure on the Et tessa defence. Towards the end\nof the half, IC were awarded\na penalty from which Kim\nHoulden scored. After the\nbreak IC played some very\nimpressive hockey, taking\nthe lead through an excellent\ngoal by Mike Isles. At this\nby Jim Marshall\npoint IC were well on top\nand had complete control\nof the game. Unfortunately\ntwo 'gift' goals In the space\nof two minutes completely\ndestroyed IC's superiority\nand rhythm, putting Et tessa in com and of the game\nthough not by any great\nskill on their part. To rub\nsalt into the wounds, the\numpire allowed a fourth\ngoal to count, after the\nwhistle had been blown for\nan offence. This completed\nthe un represent ive score\nline In a game which IC\nat least deserved a draw,\nhaving two goals diss allowed by their umpire.\nTeam:- C Brown, K Houlden,\nJ Marshall, I Hodgson, J Andrews, A floss, J Latter,\nM Isles, T Tutu, fl Fatania,\nA Brewster.\nRUGBY Imperial College A's:30 CrossCountry The A's turned out full\nof confidence and looking\nforward to a good game. That\nkick-off was arranged for\n11 o' clock( with Twickenham\nin mind) but by that time\nBel size Park had ten men\nonly on the field and were\nexpected no more than\nanother two. As the referee\nfor the Extra's game had\nfailed to turn up it was\ndecided that the remaining\nfourteen should take on the\ntwelve from Bel size Park.\nAs soon as that was settled\ninterest in the game waned.\nThere was no real\nconcentration at any time\nduring the game and the\nplay was very scrappy. IC\nwere winning so much ball\nthat people were falling\nover each other in an attempt\nto score. When half-time\narrived IC were only 12 \u2014 6\nin the lead, having let\nBel size Park in for a try\nwhich they converted.\nThe second half was a bit better. AI Harery ran\nin the second of his usual\ntwo tries, and Hugh Duncan\nscored his second try of the\nseason and that was con-verte d. Jon Pitcher, preserving\nhis energy for this week's game, ran in the last try to\ncomplete his hat-trick \u2014 the\nhighlight of the afternoon.\n(He thought differently about\nit later when he was pushed\nup the stairs to the bar to buy\na jug.).\nIn the end IC ran out easy\nwinners by seven tries and\none conversion (30 points)\nto one converted try (6\npoints). It was a game best\nforgotten. And how long are\nwe going to persevere with\nfixtures against Bel size Park (II) who have no failed\nto turn up with anything\nlike a full team on three\noccasions during the last\ntwo years?\nNext week the A's will have to play a lot better,\nas of course they are capable,\nif they are going to put\nthe same score past\nUniversity College( III).\nTeam: M Gibson; L Davies;\nC Becque; B Leeson; J Pitcher; H Duncan; AI\nHarefy; B Bubb; T Fitzgerald; M Zawarotco; C Cuthbertson; K Hawkins; N Wiltshire; M Siomiak.\nBy Christopher Cuthbertson\nBelsize Park (II): 6\nAfter an uneventful\njourney, four separate groups\nof runners met at Wye\nCollege, to form a running\nteam of nine, plus a wide\nrange of assorted accessories, who had come \" under the\nthumb\" or just for something\nto do. We ran against three\n16th s of the Wye team,\nincluding the latest anti-Ellis weapon.\nThe race progressed up\nand down the\nslope of the Wye College\nmountain (1600ft,900 ft,400 ft,150 ft?), for about four\nmiles or five and a half\nmiles depending on who was\nasked. While certain members\nslogged up and down these\nvi rtica l slopes, the accessories were having a guided tour\nof the College, and arrived\nback just in time to see\nIan Ellis sprinting in,\nagainst virtually non-existant\nopposition from the anti-Ellis weapon ( \" well, Iran\n6 miles last night, and\n6 miles this morning, so\nI didn't bother\").\nAfter these two, there\nwere six consecutive IC\nrunners, including an excellent\nrun by \" I'm only here for\nthe training\" \"Isherwood,\nwho has apparently been\noff the beer recently. Then\nfollowed a four minute gap\nbefore the final four runners\narrived \u2014 during this time\nMr Davy seemed to re acquire his taste for beer, which he\nlost on that fateful Monday\nnight a couple of weeks\nago. The final result was\nthat only the third team\nwas beaten by Wye, thanks\nto a fine run by one of the\nimports, who came in during\na short period after the\nrace was thought to have\nfinished.\nThe race was followed\nby the annual procession\nof masochists from the\nvillage to a point miles up\nin the dark, where a big fire\nwas burning. There were\nadded hazards to this\nexcursion, due to various\nundersized juvenile fire-r is hs who seemed to enjoy\nwaving flaming\naround the procession.\nThe previous Wednesday,\nagain, with a much depleted\nteam, we vis ted the nonevent of the University\nCollege, 150th Aniversary\nCelebrations. We came\nsecond in the relay which\nwas organised, but since so\nfew people went, there seems\nto be little or no information\non what happened. In fact,\ndid an IC team really enter\nthis race?\nFootball\nOn Saturday 25th October,\nOxford resounded to Welsh\naccents and cries of \" Nice, inn it?\" as JimI ley's Red\nArmy descended upon the\nunsuspecting city. We were\nthere to play our annual\nfixtures against three privileged\ncolleges. The second XI\nplayed St John's College and\nlost 6 - 1 . The third XI beat\nHertford College3 \u2014 2 and\nwere our only success, as the\nFirst s lost to St Edmund'sHall,42. This was a rather ill-tempered 'friendly'\n(not our \" fault, of course),\nthe first half of which was\nconducted under police\nsurveillance. After the\ngame the First s went back to\nSt Edmund's to make friends\nwith the opposition, and\nwatched \" Doctor Who\" on the\nCollege television (high spot\nof the day for some, wasn't it Terry?).\nThe three teams met up\nagain in Oxford that evening\nto commence the serious\nbusiness of drinking. Having tried two pubs we eventually\nsettled in the Red Lion, where we commandeered about\nfifty per cent of the saloon,\nand ignoring requests to\n\" turn it down\" etc, sat\nround drinking and singing. Somehow we all got back to\ncoach; thirty-odd steaming\nshapes in good voice and\nlooking forward to the\nCambridge trip next term.\nBadminton Imperial Mixed 1st2 Bedford 1st7 In this the toughest\nfixture of the year, Imperial\ndid well to take even in two\ngames. Helped by Bedford\nwho had to play a normal\nsubstitute man but hindered\nby the absence of their\ncaptain R Hopton, many games\nwere close enough to almost\nmake a difference to the\nscore. Still the games were\nplayed in a friendly, and\njovial atmosphere even when\nthe Stackridge roadie s began\nmoving their equipment\ninto the Great Hall. Bedford, having 5 or 6\nplayers in the UL U team\nwere deserved winners and\nwill undoubtedly remain\nunbeaten throught the\nremainder of the season.

    "content": "4 FELIX\nNUS Women's Conference\nPolitical diatribe and lesbianism\nAt six o 'clock on Saturday\nmorning, before the rest of IC\nhad recovered from Friday\nnight, two brave delegates\nset off for Bristol to attend\nthe NUS Women's Conference.\nThis was part of the NUS women's campaign which was\nset up In 1972 to promote\nboth the awareness of women's issues amongst the student\nbody, and hopefully provide\nsome solutions to problems\nraised by these Issues.\nThe conference, which was\npacked, was opened by Maria\nLoftus, the guest speaker\nfrom Islington Trades' Council, speaking on how the Trades\nUnions and the NUS could\nfurther the women's campaign.\nThis speech was largely\nirrelevant since it considered\nonly the case of the TUC and\nwomen workers. It seemed\nfar removed from any aspects\nof student life, and the speaker\ndid little to tie In the experience\nof the TUC with that of the\nNUS. In common with many\npoliticians she also spoke for\nlonger than was necessary.\nThese ideas did not really\ncome into the conference\nagain. In fact the rest of the\ntime revolved around two\nthemes: the problems that '\nwomen had setting up closed\ngroups, because under the NUS,a financed group is not allowed\nto be closed, and the foundation\nof the Network. This was\nstarted in order to combine\nall the women's groups in\ncolleges throughout the\ncountry so that they work towards\na common ideal.\nThe first of these ideas was\nbrought out very strongly\nin one of the workshops\nwe attended on 'Setting up a women's campaign in a small\ncollege'. Many women felt\nthat they could not run . an\neffective women's group with\nmen present. This was a rationale that we did not\nreally understand since Ideas\ncannot be changed unless\neverybody is educated. Besides which very few men I know\nwould enjoy sitting listening\nto 20 women discuss their\nproblems for 2 hours. A common experience was\nthat women's groups were most\neffective when tied to social activities, which made me\nthink that perhaps ICWA is\nthe perfect solution; an\nestablished body bringing\nworn ens issues to the fore!\nAfter lunch, the session\nbegan with a talk on NAC, which raised the same points\nas the conference held in\ncollege a few weeks ago.\nThese have already been\nfully reported In FELIX. There was then an attempt\nby the lesbians present, to\nthrow the men out, which\nresulted in uproar (a common\nstate during the conference)\nand 9 0 % of the people there\nvoting against them. The\nresolutions were then debated.\nThese brought out vividly the\ntwo themes of the conference\nand In fact ve iw s were split\nalmost in half. The motions\ncovered the network, the issues\nwomen face and the divisive nature of autonomous women's groups.\nWELL SOC Crime, and how to get away with it\nContinued from page 3\nThe Balloon Debate\nanything of her origins. The New Chelsea Ragtime Band\ncontinued to play whilst\neveryone adjourned to the\nQuad with sparklers, returning\nlater to finish off what was\nleft of the food.\nThe response to the Idea\nwas very encouraging and we\nwould like to thank everyone\nwho helped make the evening\na success.

It is a simple technique\nof deep meditation which is\npracticed for 15/20 minutes\ntwice a day sitting comfortably\nwith the eyes closed. As opposed to other\nmethods of meditation or\nself development, it does\nnot require any concentration\nor contemplation, belief,\nfaith, changes of diet,\nstanding on the head or\nany change in one's life\nstyle.\n\u2022 Over the last 5 years, there\nhas been a great deal of\ninterest in the technique\namong research scientists. Over 300 experiments have\nbeen published to date,\nwhich indicate that during\nTM a deep state of integrated\nrest is achieved. At the\nsame time, brain wave activity,\nas measured by E EG( electro-e ncep halo graph), become more\norderly.

These reasons\nare either fame or fortune.\nIf you want fame, not getting\nfound out is a bit awkward,\nas AI Capone could tel i you. But In truth, most of\nus want the fortune side\nof crime, and with this Dr\nShaw, professional scientist\nand amateur criminal, will be able to help us. Dr\nShaw gave us some definitions.\nA professional is a person\nwho professes to doing a job (in the literal sense),\nwhile an amateur is someone\nwho loves doing something,\nif you define the word from\nthe Latin root. Thus, all criminals in the fortune\ngroup are amateurs. Q.E.D. Now what branch of\ncrime do you want to go into?\nAccording to the Home\nOffice list (they're very\nobliging, are the Home Office)\nthere are 107 to chose from,\nbut there are only really\nthree main popular types,\nnamely Loot, Sex and drugs,\nand Sudden death. Even these three are subjects to\noccupy a lifetime of study,\nso only the first subject,\nLoot, was covered in any\nDani Salvadori\nMoira Robinson\nwith many small colleges we\nfelt that areas should have\ndelegate status. This was narrowly defeated (after 3\nrecounts!) when It came to a vote. We also voted against\nautonomous women's groups\nfeeling that it was an\nimpractical and patronising\nview, especially in this\nCollege!\nThe business got through\nin the afternoon was continually being Interupted\nby the militant lesbians who\nchallenged everything that\nwas said and sung loudly\nthrough many peoples speeches.\nFeelings at the conference\nwere very > strongly against\nthem, and for us, at least,\ntheir activities proved so boring we were on the point\nof walking out. Our overall\nimpressions on leaving the\nconference were ones of\nd lsa tls faction at the rudeness\nof many people present and\nthe Irrelevance of much that\nwas said. The main argument concerning\nthe network was whether\npeople sent from area groups\nshould have delegate or\nobserver status. This may\nseem a petty point, _but In\nfact Involves the question\nof small colleges who cannot\nafford to send delegates to\na conference, and therefore\nmust be represented by their\nareas. The points against\nthis were that areas are not\nworking effectively at present\nand that areas should pay for\nsmall col leg es to send delegates.\nComing from a part of London\ndepth. We are very lucky\nat IC if we are interested\nin this section, as not a hundred yards from here is\na rather superb national\nart collection, the V&A. According to Dr Shaw, the\nthing to go for are the\nChinese brass items, of\nwhich he considerately\nshowed us photographs. He\ndeclined to be more specific\nabout things like security\nguard rounds, which was a pity. Now If any of you have\nshares in Nat West, sell them. Although I didn't quite\nunderstand the details, but\nour speaker has a very good\nmethod for extracting money\nfrom the bank's computer.\nI wish I could tell you\nmore, but I have to go now.\nDon't forget the film next\nweek: Phase 4 is coming!\nAll right, officer, I 'll come\nquietly.\n\n"

Girl raped\nPolice seek witnesses\nLAST MONDAY night, between 10.30pm and 11.00pm, a student was forcibly raped at knife point in the\nladies toilet in the Union Building opposite the ICWA\nLounge. Police are anxious to interview two young\nladies who visited the toilets during this period.\nThey also wish to interview a man of the following\ndescription: Age 20 - 23; height 6ft; of West Indian or\nAfrican origin; medium build; medium brown complexion,\nhair - Black Afro style; deep set eyes; small nose\nand soft spoken. The man was wearing a light tan\nraincoat, a light brown V neck jumper with a green\nstripe around the neck, a light coloured shirt and a pair of dark coloured corduroy trousers.\nWill any person (including the two ladies mentioned\nabove) who was in the vicinity of the toilets at the\nmaterial time, or who has any information at all,\nplease contact the Security Officer immediately on\nInternal Telephone 2741 or call at the Security Office.\nMs Cowell to visit IC The Senior Catering\nAdviser to the Department\nof Education and Science\nand the University Grants\nCommittee, Ms Cowell, is\nto visit Southside refectory\nnext Tuesday, 18th November.\nIt appears she will be\nconducting a one day enquiry\ninto the running of the\nrefectories. She will also\nattend a special Refectory\nCommittee meeting being\nheld over a snack lunch in\nthe Penthouse dining room\nin Southside.\nWhen Ms Cowell undertook\na similar enquiry for Kings College she twisted her\nankle slipping down a set\nof stairs. She subsequently\nwrote a report based on her\ntwo hour stay there until\nher mishap.\nCuts Action\nIn the next few weeks\nstudents will be stepping-up\naction against education\ncuts in their own areas.\nAction will involve picketing\nlocal authority offices, rallies, marches and holding conferences and the cuts. London students are\ndemonstrating on 20th November against the ILE A'S proposals to cut down the\nnumber of overseas students\nin London's colleges. The effect of this, would in some\ncases, lead to closure of\nthat particular college and\nin others, the slashing of\ncourses.\nThe NUS is calling on\nall students to lobby\nparliament on 26th November\nin support of the North West\nRegion of the TUC against\nunemployment. A second\nlobby on 28th November, is being held to protest against\nthe cuts in the number of\nteacher training places. Colleges facing closure\nwill be taking wreaths with\nthem to the lobby and a funeral service is planned.\nIn addition, a petition will be presented to the DES protesting at the cuts and a deputation will go to the\nILEA to protest against\nrational is ation measures for\nthe infer London area.\nHeroine foils City raid\nLast Friday five 'heavies'\nfrom the City University made\nan unsuccessful bid to relieve\nthe Royal School of Mines\nof their mascot Davy. However, the unlucky raiders\nwere not only thwarted in\ntheir attempt, but were in\nfact trying to make-off with\nthe def nn ct mascot which had\nbeen left in the window\nof the Mines Union office.\nIt was this exhibitionism\nwhich the City raiders thought\nto tame. t Tbe saga began at about\n5.00pm in the evening when\na non de script student\narrived in the RSMU office\nto enquire if there were any\nRag Mags for sale.\nMartyn 'Norma' Levy who\nwas holding the fort, the\nMines brain cell and a Flash Gordon comic at the\ntime, then sold a Rag Mag\nto the student. Having\nthe transaction, the student\nasked if the Davy on display\nwas heavy and was\nrewarded with a posit ve reply (after all, it is full\nof concrete!)\nThe student left only to\nreturn five minutes later,\nthis time accompanied by\nfour others and asked for\nmore Rag Mags. As Norma\nturned to find the Rag Mags,\nhe was pounced on by two\nof the group whilst the\nother three made off with\nDavy.\nNorma being an experienced\nvoyeur reacted quickly to\nthe situation. He smacked\none of the raiders in the\nteeth and broke free from\nhis bound age. He then\nrushed out of the office\nand immediately came face\nto face with another one of\nthe five raiders. Without\nbatting an eyelid, he sank\nthe raider with a17% degree\nArkwright \u2014 the raider didn't bat an eyelid either.\nIn two bounds he had\ncaught up with the self-appointed Davy bearers,\ndeftly throttled one and\nchecked the others' bags\nwith his mining boot. Thus\nthe attempt to steal the\nMines ex-mascot was foiled.\n\n"

She is\nthis year's Coordinator of\nNightline, the confidential\norganisation which is run by\nstudents from all over London\nfor students who are in\ntrouble, lonely, board, fed up\nor just finding it difficult to\ncope with things. Running\nNightline ;s a full-time job\nand the post therefore carries\nra sabbatical year. The work is\nnot easy, but she enjoys the\nimmense satisfaction which\nthe job gives her because she\ngets to meet \" . . . lots of\ninteresting people: not only\nthe callers, but the Nightliners\nwhom I work with and the\nStudent Unions in the London\narea which I have to approach\nto get them involved in\nNightline\". \u2022\nCynthia is twenty-two,\nunattached, comes from\nBoreham Wood in Hertfordshire,\ngot her BSc in Nutrition from\nQueen Elizabeth College, London, in June 1974 and\ninstinctively jumps at the\nsound of a telephone. Before\nbecoming the Nightline Coordinator she spent a year at\nGarnett Teacher Training\nCollege. She speaks genuinely and\nsincerely and avoids using\ntones more suited to either\na confessional or a passionate\ncrusade. There is no feeling\nof exaggerated friendliness\nrun amok to the point of\ngullibility or dogmatic fer v our ranting up its own orifice. But\nso much easily recognisable\nthan definable and definitely\nwarrants more \u2022 than, a quick\nthumb through Roget's Picture a hot air balloon\ncoasting high above the earth\nwith four people in it. The balloon begins to tear Itself\naway from \u2022 the basket, the\nlatter being too heavy. If the\nballoon is ever to reach the\nground safely three of the\npeople in it will have to be\nejected, the person remaining\nbeing the one whose continued\nexistence can be deemed\nmost essential to the community\nin which he or she lives. This was the situation in\nwhich Nick Brayshaw (RSMU\nPresident), Ri z Shakir (ICU\nDeputy President), Ian Jowett\n( ICCA G Chairman) and myself\nThesaurus in an attempt to\ncrystal lise the blend of\nhonesty, dedication, patience,\nunderstanding and mischievous\ngorgeous ness. The origins of Night lln ego back to 1971 when it was felt\nthat the College's student\nsuicide rate was becoming a major cause for concern.\nStories of students jumping\nout of Southside, leaping off\nQueen's Tower and taking\npoison were fast becoming a a moribund folklore. A similar scheme was* being run by\nstudents at Essex University,\nso Imperial College was quick\nto realise the potential behind\nthe idea of providing premises\nin Prince's Gardens with an\nexternal telephone. Whilst IC's was only the second Nightline\nto be set up, today similar. schemes are run by students\nat nearly all the colleges,\nuniversities and polytechnics\nthroughout the country; but it\nis only in the London area that\na sabbatical is provided by all the colleges actually subscribing to the scheme. This was considered necessary\nbecause so many previous\nCoordinators had failed their\nexams due to their Nightline\ncommit t ment. How many Nightline volunteers do you have helping\nyou? \" About sixty-five\nstudents drawn from all over\nLondon.\" How many calls do you get per\nnight? \" On average, about\nthree a night.\" Do you ever get any abusive\ncallers? \" Rarely.\" Do you ever have any ho az callers? \" Never.\" How much money do you\nreceive to cover the costs of\nrunning Nightline? \" It is run\non a shoe-string budget.\"\nfound ourselves last Tuesday\nevening during ICWA's second\ndebate, a Balloon debate.\nThe first round of the\ndebate Involved slandering\neveryone else on the platform\nand projecting one's own role\nas vital to IC.\nRi z saw himself as being\nmost essential to Union\nmembers because \u2014 well let's face It \u2014 he' s got the keys to\nthe Union Building. Very few\npeople were impressed by that\nline of argument, hence Ri z was first to be ejected from the\nballoon.\nIan saw his job as one of\nhelping people whether in\nHow does one become a Nightline volunteer? \" First off they\nhave to contact us. We then\nhave a chat to them to try and\ndetermine whether the person's motive for becoming a Nlghtllner seems reasonable. The person then has to be trained\nto cope with the multitude of\ndifferent situations which can\narise during an evening at\nNightline.\" What qualities do you look tor\nin a potential Nlghtliner? \"They\nhave to be easy to talk to.\nGenerally they are people who\nare not preoccupied with\ntaking soup to the vagrants of\nCharing Cross or supervising\nadventure playgrounds. Yes, we thought, very nice too -but what about helping IC\nstudents? Thus Ian quickly followed Ri z to an untimely\n'death'.\nThat left Nick and myself,\nboth of us having convinced\nthose present during the first\ntwo rounds of our worthwhile\ncontribution to the quality of\nlife. In the final round I was\ncalled on to speak first and\nwarm eo to my task by numerous\nglasses of sherry, I portrayed\nmy job of being one which had\nmassive Implication for the\nwhole of humanity. It was a pity nobody else thought so as\nI too went tumbling out of the\nballoon leaving Nick Brayshaw\nas the balloon's affable and\ndeserving captain.\nThe debate was lively, good\nhumour ed and witty (even If,\nthanks to John Downs, most of\nthe wit did come from the\nthemselves.\" Just then the telephone\nrings.

The alarming increase in discrimination against overseas students as exemplified by a) the recent increase intuition fees. b) the new interpretation of the Immigration Laws, which has resulted in larger numbers of students being faced with deportation. c) the widening differential between hostel fees for 'home students' and overseas students.2. The Report of the CVCP Study Group on Postgraduate Education.3. The ILEA document which proposes that the number of overseas students in ILEA colleges be\ndrastically reduced, and that this would mean the closure of atleast one college, or several departments, and the termination of courses in every college. k. The recent paper of135/75 Standing Advisory Commit te for Further Education Conference reaffirms its opposition to <i Is cri mi nation against overseas students. Conference believes that:1. The present attacks constitute a deliberate and systematic attempt to exclude from post school education, overseas students who are not privately wealthy or backed by Government or business interests, and that the consequence of this is to restrict educational opportunity to the ruling elite in those countries.2. That these attacks area reflection of the way in which the grants system and the cuts in educational expenditure are restricting educational opportunity in Britain.3. That overseas students are being attacked because their isolation and the restrictions on their activities make it difficult for them to wage a campaign; and that these attacks are only precursors to attacks on the rest of the student body. k. That the ILEA proposals demonstrate the need for unity between students, because discrimination against overseas students directly affects home students. Conference further believes that:1. The presence of overseas students in Britain is a particularly valuable form of overseas aid; and that that nid should be available to all sections of society in those countries, not just those with wealth and influence; that further discrimination only restricts opportunity more and more to the wealthy.2. That overseas students contribute significantly to the broadening of the experiences of British students and to the building of a multicultural society in Britain.3. That the Government's promise in the1975 White Page on Racial Discrimination that there should be no discrimination in education should be adhered to completely, ie that discrimination intuition fees and hostel fees would unlawful. Conference calls on the Government to adhere to the spirit and provisions of the White Paper and to end discrimination against overseas students. Conference condemns the view that the shortage of finance in education can be in any way solved by making students pay for that shortage, whether through discriminatory fees or any other manner; nor should the responsibility for that shortage be directed at a minority group like overseas students.
