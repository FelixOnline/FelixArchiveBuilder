But\nthat\u2019s not what catches the attention\nof an entire cohort of physics\nundergraduates every year \u2013 it\u2019s his\nlectures, where his charisma and\nconfidence along with sheer passion\nfor the subject captivates the young\naudience.\nThe fact that someone so important\nstill has to make trips into Lecture\nTheatre One to teach undergraduate\nmaterial to a bunch of unruly\nstudents is baffling to some.\nSteve is preparing a presentation\non a small laptop when I arrive at his\noffice to interview him. The space,\nwhich he shares with three other\nacademics, is modest, featuring a few\ndesks and chairs along with a worn-out sofa in the corner and a slightly\ngrubby plasma ball on the windowsill.\nXuan Chen: So, tell us what you do,\nin a (toroidal) nutshell?\nSteven Cowley: I\u2019m the CEO of the\nUnited Kingdom Energy Authority,\nand the Head of Association with\nEURATOM \u2013 the European Atomic\nEnergy Community. This means that\nI lead research into fusion, and even\nthough I\u2019m a theoretical physicist, I\nrun experiments, too. I still have some\ntime to sit down and solve problems\nas a theoretical physicist. That\u2019s what\nI really enjoy, but that time gets\nshorter and shorter every day.\nXC: You have three fellowships\n(Royal Society, Royal Academy\nof Engineering, and Institute of\nPhysics), and a Glazebrook medal\nfor leadership in physics. Have I\nmissed anything out?\nSC: No. Awards are very important,\nand it\u2019s lovely to receive them. I\u2019m\nchuffed to receive awards, but more\nthan anything else I want to see\nfusion happen in my lifetime. It is\nthat important that we solve this\nproblem.\nAt the end of the day there is\nnothing I like better than to sit with\na problem in front of me which isn\u2019t\nsolved. And I have less and less time\nto do that. You don\u2019t choose a career\nin physics to become a celebrity. I do\nwhat I do because I want to see fusion\nsolved in my lifetime, and fusion has\nimmense challenges ahead of it.\nOne of the scientists I\u2019ve been\nreading up on lately is Enrico Fermi,\nsomeone very influential in the\nfirst nuclear experiments. My thesis\nadvisor had lectures from Fermi.\nFermi was a godlike figure, but a\nvery humble man, who liked nothing\nbetter than to solve equations, and to\nwork with students.\nThat\u2019s the fun thing about physics\n\u2013 not being looked up to, because he\u2019s\nworking with people. I\u2019m working\nwith some young people, who get\nthere faster than I do now, and that\u2019s\njust great fun to be with. I enjoy\nphysics for the social aspect: working\ntogether with other scientists to solve\nthings together.\nXC: Exactly how important is\nfusion to our future?\nSC: Think of it this way: we have a\nworld which is very unequal, at the\nmoment. Some people live very well,\nand consume lots of energy. And,\nsome people don\u2019t live very well, and\nconsume very little energy.\nIf we want to solve this inequality,\nand bring billions of people up to\nthe standard of living we enjoy, they\nare going to have to consume more\nenergy \u2013 about a factor of two or\nthree in the next forty years.\nHow we\u2019re going to supply that\nenergy without completely messing\nup the atmosphere, I don\u2019t know,\nexcept if we can crack these hard\nscientific puzzles. In the long\nterm, we have to think about solar,\nadvanced fission reactions in breeder\nreactor, and fusion, the only ones\nwhich have enough capacity to\nsustain us.\nFusion is a very attractive energy\nsource; it\u2019s clean, and sustainable (at\nleast for the next 30 million years),\nbut is very hard to actually do. As a\nscientist, that\u2019s what\u2019s also makes it so\nattractive; if it were easy, it wouldn\u2019t\nbe as much fun!\nThere are, throughout history,\nhuman quests where we try to\nconquer something, like flying.\nFor hundreds of years people tried\nto fly and when the breakthrough\nhappened, the whole world suddenly\nchanged forever.\nI think fusion is like that and\nfor me, that was one of the great\nattractions; to be really involved with\nsomething that is really difficult that\nwould really change the world. I saw\nthat it would be helpful; I saw that it\nwould be something that really has to\nbe pursued, but also something I just\nthought that it would be fun. And it\nhas been fun!\nXC: How did you get into fusion?\nDid you choose fusion or did\nfusion choose you?\nSC: I decided to go into fusion when I\nwas in my final year of undergraduate\nstudies. It was 1980 which was around\nthe time of the first \u2018oil shocks\u2019. Oil\nprices rose nearly 400% in a few\nmonths, and it was becoming clear\nthat we don\u2019t have unlimited sources\nof fossil fuels, and we can\u2019t burn all of\nthem anyway.\nAt that time, a lot of research was\ngoing into the tokomak and it was\nbecoming clearer that fusion was\nsomething that is possible; it could\nbe done! So I went to Princeton to\ndo my PhD, as it was really carrying\nout the forefront of physics research\nat that time. After that, I carried\nout postdoctoral research back\nhere at JET (Joint European Torus,\nOxfordshire), then went back to the\nStates for fifteen years. I came back to\nImperial at around 2000.\nXC: What is your background?\nWere there any figures in your life\nwho inspired you?\nSC: I grew up in Cambridgeshire\nand did my undergraduate degree\nat Oxford. At that time, I was a lazy,\ngood-for-nothing student who didn\u2019t\nwork very much. When I went to\nPrinceton to do my PhD, however,\nI was suddenly surrounded by\nincredibly intelligent, hard-working\npeople- at that time, everyone there\nwas working on string theory.\nWe used to get up at eight, work\non physics and solve problems until\neleven at night, and then go to the\nbar. At 12:30 we would set our alarms\nand get back up at eight the next day\nto keep going. That\u2019s where I learnt\nto be a physicist. About 10% talent,\nand 90% hard work and dedication. If\nyou\u2019re an undergraduate at Imperial,\nyou have the talent already.\nMy father was a scientist; he taught\nengineering at Cambridge, so I grew\nup in a family in which engineering\nwas very, very important. So even\nthough I\u2019m a theoretical physicist, I\n\"There is\nnothing I\nlike better\nthan to\nsit with a\nproblem\nin front\nof me\nwhich isn\u2019t\nsolved.\"\n\"I was\na lazy,\ngood-for-nothing\nstudent\nwho didn\u2019t\nwork very\nmuch.\"\nProfessor Cowley, potentially the busiest man\nthe fandom is strong with this one.

We passed a paper\ncondemning the Counter Terrorism\nBill, another outlining our intentions\nto lobby College to divest from fossil\nfuels, another stating our plans\nto save Pembridge Hall and yet\nanother about the rent prices for\naccommodation.\nHowever, all these decisions don\u2019t\nreally mean anything unless those\noutside of Union Council listen to our\nviews, which isn\u2019t always guaranteed\nto happen. Although we have agreed\nthat Weeks Hall is inefficient in space\nuse, and therefore if College were to\nclose it we would be happy with this,\nwe have disagreed with the closure of\nPembridge Hall.\nCollege could simply close down\nthat hall too if need be, since Union\nCouncil doesn\u2019t have the remit to\nprevent that from happening. The\nUnion Council\u2019s remit is actually\npretty narrow: we can mandate and\nlobby other powerful people as much\nas we like, but at the end of the day,\nUnion Council power simply lies with\nthe fact that they are considered to\nrepresent the entirety of the student\nbody and other people have to do\nwhat we want for us.\nI get the impression from talking\nto people this week that many don\u2019t\nactually know what the Union\nCouncil is, so instead of being all\nwhiney and opinionated this week, I\nthought I would give you a rundown\nof who makes up the Official Voice\nof the Students and what they do\nFun Felix Fact: I sit on Council and\nget a vote as the PG Non Faculty\nRepresentative, not as Felix editor,\nmeaning I represent part of the\nBusiness School.

We start our\njourney with Ben (John Lithgow)\nand George (Alfred Molina) getting\nmarried in New York City. They have\nbeen together for decades now, but\nonly now are they legally allowed to\nhave their union recognised by the\nstate. It is a joyous occasion that calls\nfor friends and family to gather for\nthe celebration. But even this happy\nstate does not last long, as life has a\nfunny way of balancing everything\nout.\nGeorge is fired from his teaching\njob at a conservative school, after the\ninstitution decides that it would not\nbe acceptable to have a married gay\nteacher teaching their students, and\nthis leads to financial difficulties for\nthe couple. Vacating their home is\nthe least of their worries, as Ben and\nGeorge find themselves having to live\napart in separate housing. Ben goes\nto live with his nephew Elliot (Darren\nE. Burrows), whereas their kind gay\npolice officer friends (Cheyenne\nJackson and Manny Perez) offer up a\nroom for George.\nIt is not the most ideal situation\nbut they both have to make do.\nBen is unwittingly thrown into the\nmiddle of Elliot\u2019s family drama, one\nthat involves his nephew\u2019s wife Kate\n(Marisa Tomei) and their teenage\nson Joey (Charlie Tahan). George too,\nstruggles with living under the same\nroof with the two young men, who\nare very socially active, having loud\nparties and gatherings almost every\nnight. But even in the midst of all\nthis, Love is Strange refuses to venture\ninto the more dramatic territory.\nThings just happen, quietly and\ncalmly, just like how every day passes\nfor the rest of us, there is nothing\nseemingly extraordinary for Ben\nand George. Director Ira Sachs keeps\neverything grounded in that you\nwill not be seeing any grand, showy\nperformances here.\nBut it is in the quiet, small, tender\nmoments that the outstanding\ncast elevates the film to excellence.\nA particularly touching moment\ninvolves the brief reunion of the\nmain pair, having not been together\nfor too long. The film also stays away\n`from getting overly political and\npreachy in tone \u2013 although there\nis plenty of space in the script for\nit to do so. For instance, the firing\nof George for his personal life is a\nplot strand that could have been\noverextended, but a simple voiceover\nof George reading a letter of thanks\nand apology to the school\u2019s parents\nsums everything up nicely without\nany unnecessary tears and drama.\nThe ending however comes as a bit\nof a shock. For a film that maintained\na slow, steady pace throughout its\nrunning time, there is an unexpected\ntime jump in which a lot seems to\nhave happened. There are important\nquestions that are never answered,\nand the final few minutes are guilty\nof taking some easy, \u2018cheat\u2019 routes to\nget a fast, neat ending. Regardless, a\nrelatively weak final act should not\ninterfere with enjoying the rest of the\nbeautifully structured narrative.\nLOVE IS STRANGE\nDirector: Ira Sachs\nScreenplay: Ira Sachs,\nMauricio Zacharias\nCast: John Lithgow, Alfred\nMolina\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: Ira Sachs,/Sony Pictures Classics\nPhoto: Ira Sachs/Sony Pictures Classics\nThe Wachowski siblings have\nsure had their ups and downs\nin terms of the films that\nhave and have not connected with\naudiences worldwide. The Matrix\nfranchise was something that made\nthem an internationally recognised\nsurname, although the films that\nhave followed since have not been\nable to replicate the success their\niconic sci-fi trilogy brought them.\nTheir credibility\u2019s downward spiral\ncontinues with Jupiter Ascending,\na preposterous, tiresome space\nopera that plays very little to the\nfilmmakers\u2019 strengths and instead\nturns into a chaotic, jumbled mess of\na movie that is currently not making\na whole load of money across the\nglobe.\nWith a $176 million production\nbudget (including the nine months\nof post-production the film went\nthrough, pushing its release date\nback by almost a year), it is easy to\nsee where all that money went. The\nendless supply of flashy computer\ngraphics portraying space warfare\nare of course supposed to be the main\nselling point of the film, promising\nplenty of action appealing to a wide\ndemographic of viewers. Sadly with\nJupiter Ascending, there is such a\nsenseless bombardment of laser\nbeams, missiles, explosions and\nrapid editing that even the scenes\nthat should have been remotely\nenjoyable turn into a string of\nincomprehensible, mind-numbing\nshots.\nNot helping in the slightest is the\nconvoluted plot that fails to develop\na single character right. Jupiter Jones\n(Mila Kunis) is an ordinary cleaner\nliving in America who is nonetheless\ndestined for great things. People\nwho clearly know a thing or two\nstart calling her \u201cyour majesty\u201d and\nbees start to randomly swarming\naround her, because bees recognise an\nindividual of royalty. Yes, really.\nShe gets tossed into a petty\nfamily squabble between three\nsiblings taking place in space. She\nis to play an important role in a\nplot of schemes and betrayals that\ndo not make any sense, and none\nof the potential villains (Eddie\nRedmayne and Douglas Booth, both\noverplaying their campy tone, and\nTuppence Middleton) really rises\nto the potential to become anyone\nparticularly memorable, phasing in\nand out then suddenly never to be\nheard from and seen again later.\nEven worse is how Jupiter Jones\nand Caine (Channing Tatum), a\ngenetically engineered ex-hunter,\nconnect on a romantic level. Jupiter\nhas no shame in quite literally\nthrowing herself onto Caine, whilst\nthe audience can only cringe at the\nhearing of the Wachowskis\u2019 poor\nscripting.\nThe characterisations of the leads\nremain baffling and unclear, and half\nthe time Jupiter is too busy falling\noff buildings and other high places\nto be contributing in any way to the\nplot. Caine is of course there to save\nher, pretty much all the time, often\nmiraculously finding out exactly\nwhere she is.\nWhen moving forward with the\nfilm slowly, the visuals are easier\nto take in and marvel at. The\nvarious spaceships and planets we\nare introduced to, are impeccably\ndesigned, the residents stemming\nfrom all sorts of weird and wonderful\nspecies living in them too, are also\ncolourfully decorated from head\nto toe. The film however cannot\nresist the temptation to just blow\neverything up the first chance it gets,\nforgetting to focus on everything else\nthat is important to make a coherent\nfilm.\nJUPITER ASCENDING\nDirector: Andy Wachowski,\nLana Wachowski\nScreenplay: Andy Wachowski,\nLana Wachowski\nCast: Channing Tatum, Mila\nKunis\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nSpace oddity\nPhoto: Andy & Lana Wachowski/\nWarner Bros.

The governing body is keen\nto downsize, whereas the Associate\nnations are, predictably, not.\nThe format has varied widely over\nthe various editions of the World\nCup, with varying degrees of success.\nThe original format of the World\nCup, which pitted eight teams in\ntwo groups of four with the top two\nprogressing to the semi-finals, was\nviewed as successful. It lasted just over\na fortnight. However, this format is\nnot viable now, as there are more than\neight Test nations.\nThe format of the 1992 World\nCup has been widely accepted as\nvery successful (even if the rules\nweren\u2019t \u2013 the rain rule proved to be\nvery controversial). It had nine teams\nwho all played each other in a league.\nSemi-finals and a final would follow.\nThis is the sort of format that the\nICC wants to implement, but it has its\ndrawbacks \u2013 the obvious one being\nthat it would result in the removal of\nthe Associate nations from cricket\u2019s\npremier tournament.\nThe Associate nations view their\nparticipation in these tournaments\nto be crucial for their boards to thrive\nfinancially. A knock-on effect of\nboards earning less money is that\ngrass roots cricket in the countries\nwill suffer. And we all want younger\nplayers to be playing cricket.\nSo, based on the assumption that\nkeeping the Associate Nations is a\ngood thing, what other formats would\nbe better? Personally, I quite liked the\n2003 format (which had two groups of\nseven and a second group stage called\nthe Super Sixes), but I understand\nwhere people are coming from when\nthey say that it felt quite long and\nbloated.\nThe ICC responded with the 2007\nWorld Cup, but that proved to be a\nfinancial disaster. In the 2007 World\nCup, the teams were split into four\ngroups of four, with the top two\nfrom each progressing to a Super\nEights stage. But what the ICC hadn\u2019t\nconsidered were the ramifications\nof the big commercial teams being\nknocked out.\nWhilst I appreciate that this is a\nrisk no matter what the format, it\nis far more likely in a group of four\nthan a group of seven. India lost to\nBangladesh, and Pakistan lost to\nIreland. Both were knocked out, and\nthe public had to deal with two weeks\nof watching (with all due respect) two\nminnows in the Super Eight stage.\nUnsurprisingly, ticket sales slumped.\nThe format for 2011 (and 2015)\nsees two groups of seven again, but\nwith the ill-fated super stages axed\nonce and for all. Instead there are\nquarter-finals before the traditional\nsemi-finals and final. Again, I have to\nsay that I quite like the format. Again,\nI also have to say that others find it\nvery long.\nSo, what is the best format? Well,\nin my point of view, the ICC should\ntake a leaf out of their book for the\nTwenty:20 World Cup. In that, there\nare sixteen teams \u2013 the ten Test\nnations and six Associate nations.\nThe bottom ranked eight teams\nhave a preliminary stage with the\ntop two sides qualifying for the\nSuper Tens, which is effectively the\nremaining ten teams playing in two\ngroups of five.\nIf the preliminary stage was to be\na knockout tournament then the\nlength of the overall tournament will\nbe significantly shorter, while the\nAssociate nations will also get their\nday in the sun.\nAnd most importantly, instead of\narguing, we can all just get on with the\ncricket.\nWhat is the best format?\nThe ICC has been searching for the perfect\nWorld Cup format for years.\nThe 1992 World Cup has often been viewed as the fairest Photo: PA\nAustralia v England\nMelbourne Cricket Ground,\n14th\nFebruary\nThe first game in Australia in\nthe tournament is one of the\nbiggest there can be.Both sides\nwill be looking to make an early\nstatement to their group about\nwhat to expect.\nIndia v Pakistan\nAdelaide Oval,\n15th\nFebruary\nThe opening weekend ends with\nthe biggest clash of them all.India\nhaven\u2019t lost to Pakistan in a World\nCup before,but Pakistan will know\nthat India have never looked so\nvulnerable going into a World Cup.\nIndia v South Africa\nMelbourne Cricket Ground,\n22th\nFebruary\nThe two most explosive batting\nline-ups from the past year face off\nin the crunch match in Pool B.Expect\nfireworks from both sides in what\ntournament seeds predict will be the\nbattle for pole position.\nNew Zealand v Australia\nEden Park,\n28th\nFebruary\nThe two hosts play each other on\nNew Zealand\u2019s home turf.The\nKiwis have been in a rich vein of\nform and have looked invincible at\nhome recently.But Australia is also\nlooking incredibly strong.It takes a\nbrave person to suggest this isn\u2019t a\npotential prequel to the final.\nThe rivalry between India and Pakistan is fierce Photo: Asia Cup\nFour mouth-watering clashes at this World Cup\nKunal Wagle picks out the four group stage matches that he is\nmost looking forward to at this year\u2019s World Cup.\nWhat is the best team ever?\nWho we\u2019d\nhave chosen\n1.\nAdam Gilchrist\n2.\nSachin\nTendulkar\n3.\nBrian Lara\n4.\nSir Viv\nRichards\n5.\nMichael Bevan\nWho the BBC\nchose\n1.\nChris Gayle\n2.\nSachin\nTendulkar\n3.\nBrian Lara\n4.\nSir Viv\nRichards\n5.\nAB de Villiers\n6.\nAdam\nGilchrist\n7.\nJacques Kallis\n8.\nShane Warne\n9.\nWasim Akram\n10.\nBrett Lee\n11.\nGlenn\nMcGrath\n6.\nKumar\nSangakkara\n7.\nJacques Kallis\n8.\nLasith Malinga\n9.\nGlenn McGrath\n10.\nWasim Akram\n11.\nMuttiah\nMuralitharan\nThe greatest One Day team, as voted for by BBC readers Photo: BBC\nThe BBC announced theirs last week.

Photo: i-D\nFollowing the release of their\nthird studio album Lost in a\nDream, Philadelphia\u2019s The\nWar on Drugs have experienced\ncathartic success. With Lost in\na Dream being named the best\nalternative record of 2014 by iTunes,\nthese guys have catapulted from\nhaving an indie cult fan base to well-deserved mainstream success.\nThe band was formed as a\ncollaborative project between the\nGod of the twangy guitar and face\nof Pantene, Kurt Vile, and current\nfrontman and lead songwriter, Adam\nGranduciel. The release of their first\nalbum, Wagonwheel Blues, saw Vile\u2019s\ndeparture from the band to pursue his\nsolo career.\nWith Granduciel in charge, the\nband\u2019s second album, Slave Ambient,\nexperienced further critical acclaim\nand demonstrated to the audience,\nmore deeply, the band\u2019s signature\nhazy sound. Lost in a Dream however,\nis a world apart from these two\nrecords. Born from a period of deep\ndepression and a whirlwind break up,\nThe War on Drugs\u2019 third album is a\npiece of art that bears Granduciel\u2019s\nheart and soul in every lyric.\nLost in a Dream is utterly, the most\nperfect road trip summer record;\nwhether it be through the baking\nheat in a dodgy convertible down\nRoute 66 or the winding backstreets\nof a derelict European village, this\npsychedelic country-rock masterpiece\nwill not disappoint.\nThere\u2019s nothing boring about\nthe motorik rhythm of this record.\nGranduciel has a knack for layering\nhis songs with a hazy harmonica and\nblazing guitars, not to mention his\nSpringsteen-esque voice, so that it all\nblends into one; a texture-filled bliss.\nAnyone who deems the album boring\nor repetitive is frankly wrong. Yes,\nthat\u2019s right, your opinion is wrong,\nand not giving this album a second\nchance is self-sabotage.\nAlmost a year after the release\nof the album, The War on Drugs\ncontinue to tour with each show\nproving more popular than the last.\nHaving experienced great success\nacross their tour last year and their\nperformance at KOKO receiving\nexcellent reviews, the band sought out\nto return to the UK.\nOne show at London\u2019s O2 Academy\nBrixton proved insufficient; a sold\nout show meant the addition of a\nsecond date at the popular venue,\nhighlighting the explosive success of\nthe band. Having been to their KOKO\nshow last June, I can vouch for these\nguys being great live performers\nwho intricately re-created every\nriff, drum roll and harmonica blare\nto perfection. Moreover, seamless\ntransitions between each song\nmeant that at some points I found it\nhard to believe that these guys were\nplaying live. Their performance was\neffortless.\nIt was evident that they were\nwell rehearsed, but in no way did\nthey come off as stiff. The radiant\nvenue served as the perfect host for\nGranduciel\u2019s band, and I can\u2019t wait\nfor their upcoming gig at Brixton this\nmonth.\nUp until now, former band\nmember Kurt Vile has somewhat\novershadowed the band\u2019s success,\nbringing Granduciel\u2019s talent into\nquestion. Granduciel himself played\nin The Violaters, adding to the\npressure of breaking out from Vile\u2019s\nshadow. Yet following the release of\nLost in a Dream, it\u2019s safe to say that\nthese guys can stand tall and proud,\nshoulder to (somewhat unkempt,\ngreasy haired) shoulder, not just\nalongside Vile, but any great musician\nout there.\nThe War on Drugs play the O2\nAcademy Brixton on Tuesday 24th\nof\nFebruary. Tickets are still available.\n\n"

For those of you that don\u2019t\nknow board games, co-operative\nboard games are those where the\nplayers work together, against the\ngame \u2013 fitting, considering the\ntheme! The thing that really sets it\napart from every other board game\non the market today is that it is\nplayed with an app (which only one\nplayer needs to have), which controls\nthe enemy AI and several other\nmundane tasks such as tracking\nincome and teaching people how to\nplay the game.\nEach of the four players takes on\na role: Commander, Central Officer,\nSquad Leader or Chief Scientist \u2013 if\nthere are fewer than four one or\nmore people will have to double\nup on roles. A game turn is split up\ninto two phases, the timed and the\nresolution phase. During the timed\nphase, the accompanying app will\ntell the Central Officer what is going\non in the world and the other players\nmust react, often forcing them to\nmake difficult decisions in very\nshort periods of time. During the\nresolution phase, the players will see\nthe effects of their decisions \u2013 a lot\nof the game happens here, but you\ncan\u2019t recover from a bad timed phase\nwith a good resolution phase.\nThe game is very easy to pick up\nand understand, and it captures\nthe feel of the XCOM video games\nperfectly. The simple rules make the\ndecisions easy to understand, but the\nchoices themselves are often very\ndifficult. The designers hit the nail\non the head with this, it not only\nrepresents the video games very well\nbut it also translates into a really\ninteresting gaming experience on\nthe tabletop. For example, one of\nthe events is a crisis \u2013 this means\nthat the Commander must draw the\ntop two crisis cards and choose one\nto happen. There is nearly never a\ngood decision here, and inevitably\nthe chosen crisis will make a big\nimpact on at least one player, which\nis exactly how a decision in a game of\nXCOM should be.\nThe timed phase is great \u2013 you\ncan pause for short periods of time\nif you need to, not completing alien\ntasks quickly enough will cost you\ntime on your own tasks, and the AI is\nactually quite strong. However, the\nresolution phase uses a push your\nluck mechanic that, whilst it does\nmimic the feel of the game, feels\nout of place in a co-operative game.\nIt\u2019s quite possible to do everything\nright in the timed phase and then\nlose the game due to bad luck in\nthe resolution phase, although the\nreverse is, thankfully, much less\nlikely. Overall though, the tech\nand combat mechanics are well\ndesigned and the game proceeds very\nsmoothly.\nThe component quality is high\n(though, sadly, the miniatures\nare unpainted and as such it can\nbe difficult to tell which soldiers\nare which), with thick tokens and\nwell-made cards. There are three\ndifferent sizes of cards, which is\nunderstandable as they each need to\nfit different roles, but would be very\nannoying if you wanted to sleeve\nthem. However, the game also has a\npretty bad insert and doesn\u2019t really\ncome with enough bags for all the\nparts.\nNow, for those of you that have\nplayed co-operative board games\nbefore, you may have heard a few\ncomplaints about them. The most\ncommon are the alpha player\nsyndrome (where one person tells\neveryone else what to do), and the\nidea that the game often plays you,\ninstead of the other way around\n(i.e. there is always an obvious\ndecision to make). XCOM deals with\nboth of these problems very well.\nAn alpha player cannot emerge in\nthe timed phase as there simply\nisn\u2019t the time to show other people\nwhat information each player has,\nthough in the resolution phase the\nopportunity is still there. As for the\nsecond problem, XCOM has always\nbeen a game of hard decisions.\nSometimes a decision is obvious,\nbut this is quite rare. This is a board\ngame all about making difficult\ndecisions very quickly, so this issue\ndoesn\u2019t really manifest like it does in\nother co-operative board games.\nIt should be noted, however, that\nthis is a much easier game than most\nother co-operative board games.\nHaving played it three times, once\nsolo and twice with four players, I\nmanaged to beat both the easy and\nmedium difficulty levels. Compare\nthis to Ghost Stories, where in the\nfirst five or six times playing the\ngame on easy we all died horribly.\nFinally, the big question is the app.\nIt\u2019s never been done in a board game\nbefore, so does it work? My response\nis a very confident yes \u2013 not only\ndoes it reduce the complexity of\nthe game significantly, but it has\nimages and music in the background\nthat add to the feel and tension of\nthe game. They put a bit too much\nfaith into the app in my opinion, as\nit really would have been helpful to\ninclude an actual rulebook in the\ngame and a few notes on how certain\nthings are calculated. However, the\ndecision to require this app was a\nsensible one. It\u2019s made the game\nsignificantly better.\nOverall XCOM: TBG is a very well\ndesigned and produced game. It fits\nthe look and feel of the video games\nvery well, and constantly leaves the\nplayers on the edge of their seats.\nIt has issues, but it\u2019s such a big leap\nforward in co-operative board games\nthat I\u2019m going to struggle to find a\nreason to play any other in the near\nfuture.\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying\nthis game out, come meet up with\nTabletop Gaming Society! We do\neverything tabletop, from Magic\nthe Gathering, to board games, to\nroleplaying games. We meet for\nboard games every Monday at 18:00\nin Huxley 711c.

The day got off to a bad start\nwhen Giles Wane decided he would\nmiss the meeting time altogether\nafter his alarm just decided it would\nnot go off that morning. The tube\njourney to Victoria Park took us past\nall of the great sights of London,\nincluding Whitechapel, a place\nwhere one of the team feels more\ncomfortable and cosy than anywhere\nelse in London.\nUpon arrival in Victoria Park it\nwas clear that this was not going to be\n90 minutes of footballing delight. In\nfact it wasn\u2019t going to be 90 minutes\nof anything, but more on that later.\nWhile the changing rooms were of\na more spacious variety than those\nat Fortress H, many rogue items\nwere found on the floor and this\nencouraged a quick change allowing\nfor more warm up time once on\nthe pitch. However, a quick pitch\ninspection showed the conditions\nto be even worse than expected \u2013\nthe Shaguar has since considered\nbuying the plot of land we played on\nto grow his potatoes, describing the\nconditions as \u201cperfect\u201d.\nIt was even discussed if goals had\nto be converted using the Klinsmann\nmethod, which was turned down\nby the opposition, something that\nbecame more and more surprising\nduring the game as it was evident\nthat they all enjoyed a good dive. The\nreferee then decided at 2pm that kick\noff had actually been scheduled at\n1:30pm instead and tried to tell us\nboth teams had shown up late. After\nmuch discussion it was decided that\n35 minute halves would be played.\nHults were given kick-off as the ref\nhad forgotten the coin for the toss\nin his bag which was unfortunately\nplaced 20m away on the touchline.\nAs the game kicked off it was\napparent that the midfield duo\nof Sam Monk and Euan Graham\nwas ideally suited for this style of\nfootball with their destructive ability,\nconquering the middle of the park\nearly. Rob Harris played his usual\nstyle with minimal running but great\nefficiency in laying off the ball to his\nsupporting cast of Ignacio Deprit,\nTom Fenning and Chris Caulcrick.\nThis created opportunities early but\nHarris missed a one on one and Chris\nfired a free kick just over the bar.\nHults were convinced that playing\nImmortals lose at home\nto Hurricanes 24-6\nSunday 8th\nFebruary saw the\nImperial Immortals clash with\nthe Hertfordshire Hurricanes at\nFortress Harlington.\nEarlier in the season the\nImmortals put in a great second\nhalf and lost 22-12 after some\ninspired work from Bob WorksF\nromHomeAlone2:LostInNewYo\nrk with the quarterback sneak of\nlegend.\nSunday\u2019s game started with the\nImmortals offence on the pitch\nafter a minute\u2019s silence of respect\nfor Tony Bainbridge,former head\ncoach of Brighton Tsunami,who\ndied earlier in the week.\nThe offence started strong;\ndriving the ball early on,which\nwouldbecomeathemethroughout\nthe game.Strong running from\nEmanuel Olagbaju and Duncan\n\u2018Wendy\u2019MacKinnon saw yards for\ndays but as with previous games\nthe offence struggled to finish and\nput the ball in the endzone.\nImmortals defense were strong\nas ever and limited the normally\nhigh scoring Herts offence to only\none touchdown in the first half,\nwhich ended with Amit Chawla\ngetting a tasty interception.\nThe second half saw the\nHerts offence put up two more\ntouchdowns and a field goal to\nput them up by 24-0.However,\nthe Immortals stuck to what they\nknew by running the ball hard and\nthrowing well.\nToby Sinclair,quarterback,threw\nfor over 100 yards on the day\nincluding some great link-up play\nbetween Toby and Noach BenHaim with special mention for the\nalways illusive yards-after-catch\nNoach managed to pick up,saw the\nImmortals fly down the pitch.\nThis megadrive saw the\nImmortals within 10 yards of\nthe Herts endzone where the\noffence punched the ball in with\na quarterback sneak with Toby\nwaltzing in for the touchdown.\nThe defense managed to win\nthe ball back for the offence\nseveral times through the efforts\nof Marin\u2018wet burp\u2019Tuleu getting\ntwo interceptions on the day as\nwell as Little Harry Collini causing\na fumble.\nHowever,the Herts defense\nstayed strong to deny the\nImmortals any more points and\nthe game finished 24-6 to Herts.\nThe Game\u2019s Most Valuable\nPlayers were: Little Harry\u2018Springer\u2019\nCollini (Line MVP for great work on\nthe offensive and defensive lines),\nMarin\u2018wet burp\u2019Tuleu (Defensive\nMVP for consistent play of defense\nand getting two picks),Noach BenHaim (Offensive MVP for great\nplay on the outside to keep the\ndrive alive several times with his\nmagic feet) and J\u00f6rn\u2018Gorab\u2019J\u00f6rg\n(Overall MVP for dominating on\nboth offensive and defensive lines\nand making the QB sneak a real\nweapon).\nSpecial mention has to go to\nMad Dog Pecs who it was nice to\nsee back playing the game with\nsome of his mind intact.A great\nperformance with an unflattering\nscore line helping the Immortals to\nlook forward to next week\u2019s game\nagainst the Birmingham Lions.\nSAM HILL\nIMPERIAL IMMORTALS\nPhoto: Imperial Immortals\non the ground through the pool of\nmud that was the pitch was their\nbest option, and this made it easy for\nthe IC defence to stop their attacks.\nThroughout the game their only\nopportunities arose from set pieces \u2013\nbut man of the match Jaime was able\nto pull off some exceptional saves in\ngoal.\nDuring the second half IC were\nreally able to show their dominance\nand the breakthrough came in the\n67th minute (three minutes from the\nend) when their keeper decided to\ntake a leisurely country stroll back\ninto his net after punting the ball\n15 metres downfield. The ball was\npoked through to Chris who did well\nto score into the open goal on a pitch\nas unstable as Frank\u2019s hands after a\nunion night.\nThe day concluded with Louis\noffering the best treats of the season\nas he ensured that everyone received\nnot only a starter but also a main\nand a dessert. Upon returning to the\nunion the 7s also decided to dominate\nBola Bola with two semi-finalists,\nkicking out many favourites on the\nway #justice. Overall, all the players\nwho had invested into the 7s were\nrewarded with an exceptional return.\nPhil Gerstenburg return from Victoria Park scarred\nafter facing a waterlogged pitch\nAn artist's impression of the challenging conditions the 7th XI faced at the weekend Photo: Steve Porter\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 33\nFELIX 13.02.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArtists\u2019 most magnificent obsessions\nFred Fyles is impressed by the Barbican\u2019s display of unseen collections\nKeyrings. That was what I\ncollected when I was younger.\nEvery time someone I knew\nwent abroad, I forced them to bring\nme back a trinket attached to a\nkeychain, until I had boxes and boxes\nbursting with these gaudy accessories\njam-packed above my wardrobe. Of\ncourse, being 8 there was no need\nfor me to own a keyring, let alone\nhundreds, but this is what lies at the\nheart of collecting: buying and then\nnot using, accumulating and storing\nephemera whose sole purpose is to\nbring enjoyment to the collector.\nI am sure I am not alone in my\ncollecting neuroses; most people I\nknow have a current collection of\nsomething, and it is hard to find\na single individual who didn\u2019t at\nsome point in their life \u2013 normally\nchildhood \u2013 obsessively collect\nsomething. The Barbican\u2019s newest\nexhibition Magnificent Obsessions:\nThe Artist As Collector, shows us that\nthe collecting bug spares none of us,\nleast of all creatives; from Hiroshi\nSugimoto to Peter Blake, everyone\nhas a secret collection at home, and\nindulging in this hobby can help\nus tap into our creative potential.\nNever have I felt so validated in my\nprepubescent fixation on keyrings.\nAsking artists to reveal to us what\nthey fixate on in their personal\nlives allows us an insight into how\nthey work, and what influences\nthem. While we are used to an artist\nproducing a \u2018product\u2019, allowing\nit to enter the public forum, by\npresenting us with what they\nsurround themselves with, Barbican\nlets us know where they get their\ninspiration from. For some artists the\nlinks are apparent \u2013 Damien Hirst\u2019s\ncollection consists of \u2013 surprise,\nsurprise \u2013 skulls, taxidermy, and\nmedical models, taken from his\nunimaginatively named \u2018Murderme\nCollection\u2019. For others, the effect\nit has on their work is less obvious.\nEdmund de Waal\u2019s collection of\nnetsuke, Japanese fasteners, may give\nus a bit of family background, but\ndoes little to help our understanding\nof his minimalist ceramics. Howard\nHodgkin goes so far as to claim that\nhis collection of Indian art has no\ninfluence on his paintings; why\ninclude it then?\nWhat is fascinating about the\nexhibition is how it highlights the\ndifferent approaches people can\nhave to collecting. Some focus on a\ncertain type of object, such as Mexican\ntattoo artist Dr Lakra\u2019s vast range of\ngarish record sleeves, while others\u2019\napproaches are more scattershot;\ntake Peter Blake\u2019s collection of old\nsigns, natural oddities, and freakshow\ndioramas. For some artists the art of\ncollecting is a professional act; Hiroshi\nSugimoto\u2019s collecting stemmed from\nhis dealership in folk art, which\nallowed him to explore Japanese\ntraditions during the 1980s and \u201890s.\nThe collection of German minimalist\nmusician and artist Hanne Darboven\nshows how what starts as a pastime\ncan spill over into an obsession; clocks\nlie against toilets, paintings lean\non mannequins, and the weight of\nhundreds of photographs strains the\nboards of her desk, made functionless\nthanks to her hoarding.\nWhile the Barbican always goes\nto great lengths to ensure that their\nexhibition space is appropriate\nfor the contents, for Magnificent\nObsessions the design is of paramount\nimportance. These collections are\nsupposed to be seen in situ, and\ntherefore the design team have tried\nto make each space seem like a living\nroom, or a study, placing carpets\nor mirrors at random intervals\nthroughout. For some rooms, the\ndesign works beautifully, such\nas Pae White\u2019s vast trove of Vera\nNeumann textile designs; ranging\nfrom handkerchief to bedspread, they\nhang from wires, like washing in the\nwind, creating a colourful abstract\nimage. For others, however, the idea\nfalls a little flat, since the collection is\npresented in such an artificial way.\nThroughout the exhibition, there\nis a strong theme of kitsch camp,\nthat vague term defined by Susan\nSontag as \u201ca vision of the world\nin terms of style\u201d. Andy Warhol\u2019s\nobsession with this side of American\nculture is well documented, and\nhere we are presented with a group\nof his exceptionally ugly cookie\njars, featuring leering clowns and\ngrotesque pigs, along with a myriad of\nother, undeniably camp, characters.\nWe can also see how Warhol\u2019s\nobsession with products influenced\nhis work; from a vitrine of children\u2019s\nplaythings we segue into a collection\nof prints featuring toys.\nWhile some collections are more\nserious, such as minimalist Sol\nLeWitt\u2019s modernist photos by August\nSander and Henri Cartier-Bresson,\nand Sugimoto\u2019s collection of morbidly\nbeautiful anatomical drawings, the\nbest ones in the exhibition are those\nsuffused with camp humour. Blake\u2019s\nrange of random objects clearly play\ninto his effervescent post-war collage\nwork, which helped form the basis\nof Pop Art, whilst Martin Wong\u2019s\nmeticulously arranged selection\nof Americana classics are positively\nbrimming with wit and life. But no\ncollection compares to Jim Shaw,\nwhose particular fixation is paintings\nobtained from thrift stores. When\na collection was exhibited at the\nICA back in 2000 their horrific\nna\u00efvet\u00e9 shocked critics, and now\nwe have a chance to revisit them.\nThey are indeed powerful; with\nslightly off proportions, and hyper-saturated colours, they leer out of\nthe canvas like surreal grotesques\nof the American nightmare. From\none painting a woman in white grins\nmanically out at us in a Lynchian\nfever dream, whilst another of a small\nchild could have been painted by\n\u2018psychological cubist\u2019 George Condo.\nMagnificent indeed.\nUltimately, Magnificent Obsessions\nis indeed a success, allowing us a key\ninsight into the lives of illusive artists.\nWhile the concept could have been\nlaborious, the Barbican have helped to\nkeep it light by including all the cult\nephemera (a polite word for crap) that\nwe may have in our own life, whilst\nalso providing examples of artists\u2019\nwork that grew out of such context.\nSo often placing something in\na museum is akin to confining it\nto a mausoleum, but by trying to\navoid endless rows of vitrines, the\nBarbican manages to inject life into\nthe exhibition. This is a celebration of\nthe object acquired not found; of the\ninner collector that manifestly resides\nin all; of the inescapable clutter of\neveryday life.\nMagnificent Obsessions: The Artist As\nCollector is on at the Barbican Centre\nuntil 25th\nMay. Tickets \u00a312\nDr Lakra\u2019s record covers collection. Magnificent Obsessions: The Artist As Collector. Barbican Art Gallery Photo: Peter MacDiarmind/Getty Images\n\n"

    "content": "6 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n13.02.2015\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUnion Council voted this\nweek to support the closure\nof Weeks hall in order to\ntransform it into space that could\nbe used for childcare provisions for\nacademics.\nThe resolve was one of many\nfrom a paper that also included the\nsuggestion to either close or keep\nPembridge Hall open too. Union\nCouncil voted to support keeping it\nopen, although Union Council cannot\nofficially determine what College\ndecides eventually to do with the\nproperties.\nIt was explained by Tom Wheeler,\nImperial College Union President\nthat, as Weeks halls is a listed\nbuilding, it is difficult to renovate,\nand internal structures cannot be\nmodified easily.\nHe also said that Weeks, although\ncontaining 67 beds, has rooms with\na much larger floor space, and as a\nwhole, the hall is an \u201cinefficient use\nof space.\u201d\nHe suggested that the hall could be\nused instead for childcare facilities\nfor academics, in a move to address\nthe faltering number of women\nacademics that remain at Imperial\nthroughout their career.\nWheeler said during the meeting:\n\u201cI am keen to fight tooth and nail\nto keep Pembridge hall, as I think it\nis essential for our accommodation\nportfolio, and we can also increase its\ncapacity by using some of its excess\nannexe space.\n\u201cI\u2019m less passionate about Weeks. It\ncould be put to better use.\u201d\nThe students present at Council\ninitially were split in their decision to\nkeep Weeks, so as Council Chair, Paul\nBeaumont was allowed the casting\nvote. After choosing to vote in favour\nof keeping Weeks as accommodation\nand to mandate college for its\nrenovation, a student present at\nthe meeting challenged Beaumont,\nand asked for an explanation for his\ndecision.\nBen Fernando, RAG Chair, then\nasked to rerun the vote after the\nstudent challenged the chair, and\nthose present were forced to vote\nagain. After this new vote, enough\npeople changed their vote, and\ndecided against mandating College to\nkeep Weeks as a student hall.\nPaul spoke to Felix after the\nmeeting, and explained that he\nused his casting vote to support\nthe ongoing use of Weeks Hall as\naccommodation because he thought\nUnion Council vote to support closure\nof Weeks Hall in Princes Gardens\nPhilippa Skett reports from meeting that brands hall \u201can inefficient use of space\u201d\na significant enough proportion of\nCouncil had issues with the closure\nbefore the vote was rerun. However,\nhe allowed the revote to go ahead\nwhen challenged, and explained that:\n\u201cI don\u2019t particularly like using casting\nvotes to make democratic decisions.\u201d\nWheeler also said to Felix after the\ndecision was made: \u201cWe admit that\na reduction of 60 bed spaces close\nto campus is a loss, however it was\na mature decision taken by Union\nCouncil to focus the lobbying and\ncampaigning resources of the Union\non saving Pembridge, a hall that can\nbe saved.\u201d\nHowever, those outside of the\nmeeting were less than impressed\nwith the news that Weeks may no\nlonger be used as halls.\nOne person on twitter was not\nhappy that the wardening and hall\nsenior team had allegedly not been\ninformed of the plans to close Weeks.\n\u201cWhy did nobody mention this to the\nwardening or senior team of Weeks?\nSurely our voices, if any, should be\nheard.\u201d\nSaid an academic from Imperial:\n\u201cDevil is in the details, but it sounds\nbad for students who want to live\ncheaply and close to College.\u201d\nSaid another Felix reader on our\nfacebook group: \u201cI\u2019m really sad to\nhear this. It\u2019s decisions like these\nthat is a large part of the reason\nwhy Imperial doesn\u2019t have the\nstrong alumni network of other\nuniversities.\u201d\nOthers said it was a sad decision,\nalthough one did describe it as\n\u201ctypical.\u201d Another continued,\n\u201cIt does go along with Imperial\u2019s\naccommodation strategy - the one\nwhere they don\u2019t care about us.\u201d\nAnother student was unimpressed\nwith the decision, stating on twitter:\n\u201cHow lovely for the 67 students who\nnow have to live further away from\ncampus.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll turn out as useful as\nGarden [hall] has.\u201d\nGarden Hall, also situated in\nPrinces Garden but relatively cheaper\nin price than other halls in Eastside\nand Southside, was closed in 2013.\nThe hall was shut by the College\ndespite students protesting against\nthe closure.\nThere has recently been\nconstruction work on the building,\nand College Chaplaincy, the multi-faith centre for Imperial, was moved\ninto Garden Hall after renovations\nwere done on the East Basement of\nBeit where it was previously based.\nWeeks Hall, but for how much longer?.

A few years\nago, in a competition that only ran\nonce, Imperial College Symphony\nOrchestra (ICSO) was awarded the\ntitle of \u201cBest University Orchestra in\nthe UK\u201d. That\u2019s quite an achievement\nagainst universities in which most\norchestras have at least some music\nstudents!\nJust a couple of weeks ago, the\nInternational Championships of\nCollegiate A Cappella came to the UK\nfor the first time and held their semifinal at Imperial. With more teams\ncompeting than any other University,\nand an award for best soloist, the\nevent was a sure sign of Imperial\u2019s\ntalents.\nWe have five orchestras, one\nof the best university cinemas in\nthe country, fantastic choirs and\nambitious art and dance groups.

One golden cup,\na bottle of champagne and enough\ntime for the muscle spasms to subside\nlater, we decided to go again, except\nthis time bigger and better!\nThis year, ten members of IC Skate\nSoc are undertaking one of the world\u2019s\nmost challenging skate races.\nThis is where Adrian Wordsworth\ncomes in. Adrian has been skating\nsince he was a toddler and has gone\non to win 21 British speed skating\ntitles. He has been a fixture on the UK\nskating scene for decades.\nOur captain and Chair last year,\nJenny Lenz, met Adrian last year at\nLe Mans and Adrian has generously\noffered to train our team this year.\nHis company Troup Bywaters +\nAnders will also sponsor us for some\nreal shirts this year! Thanks to this\ngenerosity we plan to steal back the\nCup of Glory from our rivals at other\nUniversities worldwide.\nThis Wednesday was our first\ntraining session. Though bitterly cold,\nthe sun was shining and we headed\ndown to Serpentine road in Hyde\nPark. Setting out a small circuit, we\nbegan with the basics and learned the\nstance preferred by speed skaters\u2026\ngetting really, really low! After two\nminutes skating in this position, our\nthighs were on fire and our lower\nbacks were starting to complain.\nThe paceline (a technique where a\nlong line of skaters all skate in perfect\nunison, so that wind resistance is\nreduced for everyone except the poor\nleader) was equally difficult, with\neveryone bumping into each other\nand falling behind in turns. How on\nEarth were we going to take on this\nmammoth race?!\nAnd yet, within half an hour we\nwere getting it, and skating with\nperfect form around our circuit. We\nlearned about planning lines around\ncorners, about passing batons without\ndecelerating (scary!) and much more.\nWithin 2 hours we were all hooked,\nand excited for the next training\nsession!\nBy the time Le Mans rolls around in\nJune, we\u2019re hoping to be a well-oiled\nskating machine \u2013 in no small part\nthanks to Adrian\u2019s expert training. If\nyou\u2019re interested in learning to skate,\nor in joining the speed skating team,\nIC SkateSoc meet every Wednesday at\n13:00 in Beit Quad, and can provide\nskates and pads.\nSpeed Skate training is the first\nweek of every month at the same\ntime as usual skate sessions.

Now in its sixth season,\nthe show has amassed a huge audience\nof children providing consistently\nhigh ratings, and succeeded in\nfostering a \u2018cult favourite\u2019 status\namong many adults. There\u2019s not a\nnerdy shop around without AT kitsch\nof some kind, and college students\nworldwide have posters of it hanging\nin their rooms. In short, nerds,\nparents, students and stoners all love\nAdventure Time!\nIn fact, it\u2019s been more than just\na success to the channel, it\u2019s been\na life saver. Before AT, CN was\nactually struggling a bit. It got so bad\nthat a few years ago, in an attempt\nto compete with Nickelodeon\nand the Disney Channel, they\nstarted investing in live-action\nprogramming! Most of it was rubbish,\nbut they were too scared to take risks\non creating new animated content,\nwhich is often expensive to produce.\nThat is until AT came along.\nAT was the success they needed\nto boost their confidence in their\nanimation division, and it shows. AT\nhas blossomed into an animation\n\u2018renaissance\u2019 of sorts for the channel,\nand to a small extent the Western\nanimation world in general. CN has\ndone an excellent job of capitalising\non the success of the show in the\nbest way possible for everyone: by\nrecognising talent.\nAT\u2019s creator, Pendleton Ward (a\nname so whimsical its owner couldn\u2019t\nbe anything but a children\u2019s cartoon\ncreator), surprised many last year by\nannouncing he had already quit the\nshow halfway through season five.\nThe reason this was surprising is that\nno one noticed! There was no obvious\ndip in quality after he left. And the\nreason for that is that the show has\namassed not just a huge audience,\nbut a large talent pool. The show isn\u2019t\njust one man; it\u2019s built on the work\nof incredibly talented animators,\nstoryboard artists, writers, directors,\nand more. The executives at CN must\nhave realised this, because they\u2019ve\ngreenlit three shows by creators\nwhose main credit is AT. Here\u2019s a\nguide to some of them.\nTOM RIVLIN\nSECTION WRITER\nBravest Warriors\nThe first show to come from a former\nAT person, Bravest Warriors has\nnothing to do with CN, but an online-only studio/YouTube channel called\nAnimation Domination. Debuting in\n2012, it\u2019s is an animated short series\n(five minutes per episode) from Ward\nhimself, with a more sci-fi aesthetic,\nand slightly older characters. It\u2019s\nstill got all of AT\u2019s charm and\nwhimsy (mostly thanks to the heart-wrenchingly adorable Catbug), and\nhas been met with critical acclaim.\nDespite each episode\u2019s brevity, there\u2019s\na surprisingly complicated plot going\non beneath the surface, and I don\u2019t\nknow about you but I\u2019m excited to see\nwhere it goes!\nSteven Universe\nThe first show CN itself picked\nup from an AT personality, Steven\nUniverse is an eleven-minute\nanimated series created in 2013 by\nformer AT writer Rebecca Sugar.\n(As far as I can tell, yes, this name of\npure whimsy is really hers.) If you\nthought AT was charming, you are\nnot prepared for the pure, undiluted\ncharm Sugar pours into Steven\nUniverse. Steven himself is charming,\nhis interactions with other characters\nare charming, the aesthetics are all\ncharming\u2026 you get the picture.\nBut amazingly, alongside the\ncharm is a surprisingly heartfelt\nstory about loss and the value of life\nand family, with wonderful morals\nso simple that kids will absorb them\neasily, and profound enough to still\nmean something to cynical grownups like us. It also has a refreshingly\nfeminist narrative, not despite its\nmale protagonist, but because of\nhim. Steven learns the value of good\nfemale role models (or rather, he has\nan innate sense of this from the start)\nthrough his guardians, the Crystal\nGems, and hopefully he imparts some\nof that insight to the kids at home.\nOver the Garden Wall\nOver the Garden Wall was a ten-episode miniseries aired on CN last\nyear, created by former AT writer,\ncreative director, and boring-name-haver Patrick McHale. It can best\nbe described as a weird bastard mix\nof the Brothers Grimm, L. Frank\nBaum, and Mark Twain, with sources\nlike Walt Disney and even Dante\nthrown in for good measure. Simply\nput, this series was a masterwork. Its\nminiseries format lent itself to being\nvery tightly written, with a strong\nbeginning, middle and end, and it\nneeds to be watched about five times\nto get everything out of it. It lingered\nin my mind for weeks afterwards, too.\nLike with all fiction, it would be\nnothing without great characters,\nand maybe I was just projecting,\nbut I loved the fusspot/complainer\nWirt and his younger brother, the\nendlessly optimistic Greg, who both\nbecame immediately likable as they\nwandered through the Unknown.\nAlso, I won\u2019t lie, I teared up a bit (ok, a\nlot) at the end.\nAnd Still More...\nFor completeness, there are two more\nshows to mention here: Animation\nDomination\u2019s Bee and PuppyCat, and\nCN\u2019s Clarence, both from former AT\nstaff. But even then, this isn\u2019t the\nwhole story. CN has been very good\nlately at finding new talent through\ndevelopment programmes of various\nsorts (Over the Garden Wall was based\non a short film McHale made in 2013\nas part of CN\u2019s shorts development\nprogram). The fact that a lot of\ntheir new shows are from young,\ninspired creators is a testament to a\nchannel taking risks, and those risks\npaying off for the channel and the\naudience. So, jaded twentysomething\nmillennials, remember the \u2018golden\nage\u2019 of CN studios cartoons in the late\n90s/early 00s, with stuff like Dexter\u2019s\nLaboratory, Samurai Jack, and The\nPowerpuff Girls? Well, it\u2019s back.\nPhoto: Pendleton Ward/YouTube Photo: Rebecca Sugar/CN Photo: Patrick McHale/CN Photo: Natasha Allegri/YouTube\nPhoto: Pendleton Ward/ YouTube Photo: Rebecca Sugar/CN Photo: Patrick McHale/CN Photo: Skylar Page/CN\nPhoto: Cartoon Network\n\n"

Teams comprised of 6\nmen or 4 women, each running a lap\nof the 5 km course, beginning by the\nSerpentine and looping clockwise up\nto Marble Arch before returning to\nthe bandstand.\nThe likes of Cambridge, Oxford,\nPortsmouth, Manchester and many\nof the London Colleges sent teams to\ncompete, and were joined by over 150\nstudents of Imperial College taking\non the challenge themselves.\nAt 12 noon, Club Captain Matt\nDouthwaite started the race with a\nwelcome and a blast of the whistle,\nand the leg one runners took off down\nthe opening straight led by some\npretty big names in the running world\nand some more excitable internal\nrunners.\nChris Bannon, one of the main\norganisers of the event, was first\nup for the Imperial Men\u2019s A Team,\nhoping to defend his 2 year title of\nfastest leg at the event, but faced stiff\ncompetition from Cambridge runners\nwho\u2019d lined up some of their best.\nAlso on the start line was Imo\nSimmonds running for the Imperial\nWomen\u2019s A Team, backed up by the\nfull scoring team who placed 8th in\nBUCS XC seven days earlier, so hopes\nwere high for a medal.\nOnce underway, the race moved\nfast. Bannon and Short jostled for\n1st place at the front. The hundreds\nof other runners sailed past \u2013 not\nonly IC Cross Country and Athletics,\nbut also Imperial students with\nall manner of points to prove and\na hilarious range of fancy dress\ncostumes. Spotted outfits included\nsuperheroes, gentleman dressed in\na bra and hot pants and Braveheartstyle tartan robes.\nUnfortunately Cambridge were\nfirst at the end of leg one, 12 seconds\nahead of Bannon, who ran 14:33! He\nhanded the bat over to Chris Olley\nto charge down the Cambridge team.\nHe ran a time of 14:47, extremely\nimpressive. Over in the Women\u2019s\nrace, Imo had handed over to Sarah\nJohnson, who went on to run one of\nthe legs of the day with 17:16. The\nmass of teams around the bandstand\ncreated a fantastic atmosphere and\nsome spectators ventured out onto\nthe course to provide support for\ntheir runners.\nThe Imperial Men\u2019s A\u2019s were still\nholding on tight with pressure from\nSheffield and Oxford too. A third\nChris (Thomas) put in a strong run\nto keep them in the game following\nDavid Freeman, handing on to Simon\nPrigent and finally James Ellis. The\nWomen\u2019s A\u2019s were also battling away\nand with great runs from freshers\nAlex Mundell and Kara Meunier with\n18:03 and 20:00 respectively.\nThe Men\u2019s B Team boys had\nimpressive performances from Tom\nBartissol and Dom Marshall, both\npushing 17 minutes.

The rather small tunnel\nwas just about able to take a single\nbit like a bowling ball, or be at the\nreceiving end of some Breaking Bad\njokes.\n\u201cPlus I think I am going to miss my\nhair keeping me warm!\u201d\nOther charities RAG are donating\nto this year include Tiny Tickers,\nwho endeavour to train professionals\nto detect heart conditions in young\nchildren, St Mungo\u2019s Broadway\nwho are committed to helping the\nhomeless, and the Mines Advisory\nGroup, who are dedicated to clearing\nland mines in war torn countries.\nFelix spoke to Ben Fernando, a\nthird year Physicist and current\nRAG Chair, about the planning and\npreparation for the week. He said\nthings had gone very smoothly,\nalthough the RAG launch event on\nthe Monday was the most difficult to\norganise.\n\u201cCo-ordinating things for then was\npretty tough, especially as we had the\nbungee jump, the band playing and\nalso the senior College staff making\npancakes. We also needed plans to\ncover for bad weather, but luckily\nPhilip Kent takes Felix on a unique journey into Imperial\u2019s tunnels.\naverage-sized person\u2013the walls\nwere clad with large water,steam,\nand drainage pipes as well as\nconduits for ICT cabling.\nThe temperature varied wildly\nas we walked,crouched,and (in\nsome places) crawled through\nthe labyrinth of tunnels under\nImperial.Occasionally we would\nstop to admire various pieces of\ninterest around the network\u2013such\nas ancient graffiti sprawled all\nacross the walls from explorers\npast,the huge EDF heat and power\nfacility under EEE (this generates\nthe infamous steam),and the over\n100 year old paddle fan under\nRCS1.\nOur guide explained the purpose of\nthe various services provided in the\ntunnels,which included extra-high\nvoltage electricity for servicing the\nlabs in ACE.One point of notice was\nthe very long corridor underneath\nExhibition Road over to South and\nEastside.\nOur guide told us the route was\nsealed years ago as part of a wider\nmodernisation scheme to keep\nout squatters\u2013the works included\naddition of swipecard protection to\nall the doors,and modern lighting.\nThrough some of the oldest tunnels\naccessed through a boiling hot\nsub-basement in Biochemistry,we\naccessed the foundations of the\nQueen\u2019s Tower.Armed with sharpies,\nwe added to the masses of graffiti\non the concrete base.A few of us\neven climbed through the holes and\nstood directly in the centre of the\ntower\u2013our guide explained that\nin the past a homeless man would\nregularly spend the night in the\nconcrete cavern.We ended our tour\nshortly after,climbing up a ladder\nand popping out of a trapdoor onto\nthe Queen\u2019s Lawn,much to the\nbemusement of passers by.\nIn reflection,it\u2019s quite clear\nwhy students aren\u2019t usually\nwelcome down there\u2013without\nthe knowledge of someone who\nknows the area,it was easy to get\ndisorientated and lost.\nIn some cases,faulty pipes leaked\nscalding hot high-pressure steam\ninto the tunnel,and other parts\nwere flooded.But by far the most\ndangerous part was the ladder to\naccess the base of Queen\u2019s Tower\n\u2013visitors had to also avoid the\nboiling hot uninsulated pipe placed\nconveniently above the ladder.\nAll in all it was a fantastic tour,\ntravelling somewhere usually\nforbidden definitely gave the burst\nof adrenaline and excitement I\nexpected.\nMy thanks to both the Estates\nDivision and RAG.I hope it continues\nagain next year.\nfor both days the weather stayed\nrelatively dry.\u201d\nFernando also wanted to run a\nzip line from the top of the Central\nLibrary down onto Queen\u2019s Lawn, but\napparently the scaffolding needed to\nset it up was too expensive.\nFelix asked Fernando if Imperial\nRAG would ever consider joining\nforces with the Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine Student Union\nRAG team, who had their RAG Week\nlast week, and he said it would be\nunlikely.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really interact; we talk to\nensure when we plan our events they\ndon\u2019t clash but that is about it.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t look like RAG will be\nintroducing a pub crawl similar to the\ninfamous Circle Line pub crawl any\ntime soon either.\nSaid Fernando, \u201cI don\u2019t think the\npub crawl fits in with the image we\nwant to promote, to be honest.\u201d\nAlthough the Week isn\u2019t quite\nover yet, and there are still more\nevents planned for later this term,\nthe fundraising target from this\nweek is \u00a310,000, a figure Fernando is\ncomfortable they will reach.\nOn Monday alone RAG raised\naround \u00a31700 in cash donations, and\nhave collected almost \u00a34000 donated\nthrough their website.\nThe committee have already turned\ntheir attention to next year\u2019s RAG\nWeek plans.\nFernando told us RAG is currently\nin talks with College over getting\ntimetabled afternoons off so all\nstudents could take part, so watch\nthis space!\nFrom bottom photo going clockwise: A long shot down the tunnels under College, RCSU help with the candyfloss, Alice Gast and Muir Sanderson struggle to get to grips with pancakes, and\nTom Welton takes to the fire walk Photo credit: Felix\n\n"

In 2013, installed global PV\ncapacity increased by just under 40%,\nfrom 102GW in peak conditions, or\nGWp, in 2012 to 139GWp in 2013.\nAccessing the economies of scale\nassociated with this huge ramp up in\nproduction, prices are falling below\nthe milestone $1/Wp, according to an\nImperial College London/Grantham\nInstitute report last November. Some\ncountries are starting to reach \u201cgrid\nparity\u201d \u2013 a term which essentially\ndescribes the potential for solar power\nto compete with conventional (fossil\nfuel) generation in electricity markets\nwithout the need for subsidies.\nWhen people talk excitedly about\nthis success, they are almost entirely\nreferring to crystalline silicon-based\nPhotovoltaic solar power (c-Si PV).\nLast year the International Energy\nAgency estimated that c-Si\u2019s market\nshare of all PV technologies had\ngrown to around 90%, with the\nremaining 9% constituting almost\nentirely of what\u2019s known as ThinFilm PV, a more flexible, less energy\nintensive alternative seen as the\nsecond generation of PV technologies.\nIn fact, apart from a brief concern\nover stability of silicon supply chains\nin 2009 which allowed Thin-Film PV\nto take around a 15% wedge of the\nmarket, c-Si has almost always been\nthe vastly dominant solar technology.\nPerhaps on the back of this\nsuccess, there have been a wave\nof new technologies, the so-called\nthird generation solar technologies,\nwhich are hoping to capitalise on\nthe enthusiasm felt in current solar\nmarkets by exploiting some of the\nproblems seen with traditional PV.\nIndeed, despite its current\nhegemony, c-Si PV is by no means\na perfect technology. Its recent and\nhistorical success is arguably rooted\nin policy commitments.\nFor example, Germany\u2019s the\nrevolutionary Feed-in Tariff for\nsilicon-based PV in 2000 encouraged\nindustry standardisation, an\nincreasingly secure supply chain and\nglobal market acceptance. Of course,\nthis should not be used to undermine\nc-Si PV\u2019s success but, crucially, and\nfascinatingly, this does mean there is\nroom for improvement, as is always\nthe case with new tech.\nWhat\u2019s all the fuss about?\nOne of the biggest problems faced by\nc-Si cells is that they are limited to a\nmaximum theoretical efficiency (i.e.\nthe maximum amount of the sunlight\nthat hits a solar panel that can be\nconverted into electricity) of around\n33% with solar efficiency tables in\nrecent years consistently recording\nthem at around the 25% mark.\nThis limit, known as the ShockleyQueisser limit after its discoverers,\nessentially exists due to the fact that\nsunlight reaches the Earth at many\ndifferent wavelengths, only some of\nwhich can be absorbed by silicon cells\nto generate electricity.\nBy contrast, using combinations\nof different semiconductors such as\ngallium arsenide and germanium,\nso-called \u2018multi-junction\u2019 (MJ) cells\ncan expand the range of wavelengths\nabsorbed by the cell overall,\ngenerating more electricity. To do\nthis requires sunlight to be highly\nconcentrated via parabolic mirrors or\nlenses onto the cell area and, as recent\nlaboratory tests by the Fraunhofer\nISE in Freiburg have recorded, can\nproduce staggering efficiencies of\n46%.\nIn actual fact, some of these\nConcentrator Photovoltaic (CPV)\nsystems using MJ cells are already\noperational with one in Arizona\nproducing electricity with cell\nefficiencies of around 36%. Further\nmodelling by Illinois State University\nof potential future CPV locations in\nthe Southwest USA has shown that\nany project which is situated in an\narea with direct sunlight greater than\n5.4 kWh/m2\n\u2013 the amount of sunlight\nyou might expect from a holiday in\nSouthern Italy as a very rough idea\n\u2013 can have a higher Internal Rate\nof Return than equivalent c-Si PV\nprojects.\nNot all Sunshine and Roses\nNecessarily with every new\ntechnology, CPV has its drawbacks.\nUnlike conventional c-Si PV\nwhich can produce electricity\nin normal daylight even with\ncloud cover (although obviously\nnot as efficiently), CPV systems\ncan only function properly with\ndirect sunlight, or Direct Normal\nIrradiance (DNI), that hits modules\nat the right angle so that light can be\nconcentrated in the right direction,\nnamely, onto the small and highly\nefficient MJ cell area. As a result,\nCPV systems often need highly\naccurate solar trackers to make sure\nthey are always receiving as much\ndirect light from the sun as possible.\nThis in turn pushes up both economic\nand energy costs, although studies\nfrom the University of California,\nBerkeley find that energy costs are\nstill generally regarded as competitive\nwith conventional PV.\nSo it is not for everyone. CPV can\nonly really be deployed at utility-scale\n\"There have\nbeen a new\nwave of\ntechnologies,\nthe so-called\nthird\ngeneration\nsolar.\"\nJoshua Emden on the story behind this ever evolving technolgy and what\u2019s\nin store for the future in solar technology\nSolar power is expanding:\nmeet the third generation\n\"CPV systems\ncan only\nfunction\nwith direct\nsunlight.\"\n330nm-thick film of organometal halide perovskite fabricated on a glass sheet.

Photo: Dominic Lagrue\nThe Imperial College School\nof Medicine Students\u2019 Union\n(ICSMSU) presented an Arts\nRevue last Sunday, 8th\nFebruary,\nto conclude what has been, by all\naccounts, a very successful Raising\nand Giving (RAG) week.\nThe show was performed in the\nUnion Concert Hall and featured acts\nfrom various Medics\u2019 performing\narts societies including music, Dance\nand Light Opera, as well as a sneak\npreview of ICSM Drama\u2019s upcoming\nproduction of Beauty and the Beast.\nICSM Light Opera and ICSM Dance\nperformed numbers from Hairspray\nand Cole Porter\u2019s Anything Goes,\nwhile the evening also saw, for the\nfirst time ever, a performance from\nall of the Medics\u2019 music societies\n(Chamber Choir, Choir, Orchestra,\nJazz Band and Bands).\nTwo of the Union\u2019s sabbatical\nofficers, Abi De Bruin (Deputy\nPresident, Clubs & Societies) and\nChris Kaye (Deputy President,\nWelfare) attended the evening, and\nAbi lauded the \u201cincredible ICSM\ntalent\u201d on show.\nSarah Hough, who founded Arts\nRevue and planned much of the\nevent, said \u201cI didn\u2019t realise quite\nhow much organisation and how\nmany logistical nightmares would be\ninvolved in creating this event! But\nseeing four of ICSM\u2019s arts societies\ncome together to create something\nincredible and doing what we love to\ndo made it all worthwhile.\n\u201cI hope Arts Revue will continue to\nbe a yearly opportunity for these four\nsister societies to work together and\nshow you all how incredibly talented\nand enthusiastic our members are.\u201d\nRAG week featured \u2018I\u2019m a Club\nCaptain, Get Me Out of Here\u2019, which\nwas filmed on Tuesday and screened\nin the Reynolds bar on Thursday\nnight. Medics\u2019 team captains (and\nsome of the ICSMSU Exec) were\ngiven \u2018fun\u2019 challenges, competing\nfor a chance to participate in the\nlive Bushtucker trial in the bar on\nThursday.\nOne of the more controversial\nevents was the time-honoured\ntradition of \u20184-skinning\u2019. The idea\nis that 4 second year medics are\nnominated from the ICSM sports\nteams, who then compete to gain the\nmost sponsorship. The winner has\ntheir head shaved. The lucky prize\nthis year went to Football\u2019s Wenrui\nSun. Wen described the experience as\n\u201ceven more crushing\u201d given that he\nhad previously avoided his head being\nshaved on tour.\nA fundraising total is yet to be\nreleased by the ICSMSU committee,\nwith further events running over the\nnext few weeks, including the RAG\nValentine\u2019s Ball at the Phoenix Arts\nClub on Monday.\nIt\u2019s really reassuring to see that\nMedics have time to cultivate\ninterests outside of their degrees\n(at least in the first two years), and\nwe here at Felix look forward with\nanticipation to next year\u2019s Arts Revue.\nSarah Hough performs as Elle from the musical Legally Blonde.

There will also be a bar,\nalthough this will only serve alcohol\nafter 5pm so as not to encourage\nacademics turning to liquor so early\non in the day.\nAlthough the plans remain top\nsecret, Hangman was able to sneak\ninto the preliminary meetings,\ndressed as a busboy and pushing\na trolley featuring SCR breakfast\ndelicacies, including three-day-old\nscrambled eggs and soggy bacon.\nWhilst serving up coffee Hangman\noverheard the plans to turn one whole\nfloor into a bubbletea outlet. Said\none consultant to the board, \u201cThat\nvaguely named F-East outlet in the\nJCR is doing really well. Surveys show\nthat students from the East like food\nalso from the East, and bubbletea is\napparently a delicacy from out there.\u201d\nAnother plan is to have a 50m long\njacket potato station, complete with\na salad bar similar to that in the JCR.\nA different consultant suggested that\nthe students could then fill a potato\nwith their choice of salad, although\nthis was met with trepidation as some\nwere keen to point out that students\nare not used to such varied filling\nchoice when it comes to staples such\nas the mighty potato.\nOne warned: \u201cIf we start letting\nthem think you can put more into a\npotato than just soggy tuna or plastic\ncheese, we may see a culinary uprising\non our hands.\u201d\nHowever, when one board member\nsuggested the quality of the potato\nshould also be addressed, they were\nmet with unfaltering laughter, with\none colleague actually wiping tears\nout of his eyes and another rolling on\nthe floor.\nFurther blueprints depicted a\nseries of fountains that would pour\nout drinkable aloe vera water that\nstudents could then refill their bottles\nfrom, and another bar dedicated\npurely to creating the award winning\nchicken and bacon baguette by hand.\nThere was conflict over the idea to\npresent facilities for evening meals\nhowever, with one member stating\nthat \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t spoil the students\ntoo much.\u201d\nNane Jeary, who chaired the\nmeeting, agreed and then added: \u201cI\nfeel uncomfortable providing more\nthan one outlet that serves healthly,\nhot meals past 5pm.\n\u201cHowever, if we are to add another,\nwe should really shut it by 7pm so\npeople working late in the library\nare forced to go to Imperial College\nUnion or h bar.\u201d\nUnion Overlord (Diago McCalidad)\nwas also present. New to the role of\nTop Guy In Charge of Food, Drinks\nShock election stats:\nhow big is yours?\nAnew study by Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine has found\nthat the average size of a big\nelection can very by as much as 2.4\npositions from country to country.\nAfricans tend to have Big Elections\nof around 7.8 positions, whereas in\nCanada the average is 5.4.\nSilippa Phett, an alpha female, told\nHangman that the size of the Big\nElection is not important, it\u2019s about\nhow you use it.\nShe continued \u201cThere\u2019s nothing\nmore satisfying than a Big Election\nhitting all the right places\u201d.\nHangman did ask if performance\nis reduced with a smaller Election.\nPhett replied, \u201cWith a Big Election,\nthe pressure can be just too high and\nthe likelihood of a unsatisfying finish\nis far greater.\n\u201cI much prefer a happy ending when\nan Election is involved.\u201d\nIn other news, a student has fallen\nseriously ill campus today. A spy at\nthe health centre discovered he had\na whopping 50 positions in his Big\nElection \u2013 all of the ones on offer.\nPhysicians have repeated their\nwarnings about the excessive effects\nof democracy on the body, as it can\nlead to starving the brain of blood.\nOne doctor said, \u201cWe recommend\nall students to read the label provided\nwith Democracy before using it.\n\u201cWe know that Democracy can\nhelp people to overcome feelings of\ninadequacy around their Big Election,\nbut overdose can have a number\nof side effects including mocking,\ndisappointment, and - as seen in this\ntragic case \u2013 death.\u201d\nManufacturer ePfizer were\nunavailable for comment.\nand Bars and a driving force behind\nthe halls takeover, McCalidad\nproposed another Union-ran dining\nspace be included too.\nPlans were drawn up to advertise\nit as \u201cThe longest bar to also house\nseveral hundred mice.\u201d However,\nupon hearing a suggestion from\none consultant that maybe this\noutlet could provide more variation\nthan the undistinguishable meals\ncurrently available at h bar and\nFiveSixEight, McCalidad turned red\nin the face and cried \u201c\u00bfPOR QU\u00c9?\u201d\nHe stated that providing meals that\ncan be prepared without being fried\nor defrosted may be \u201cPushing the\nboat out a bit.\u201d\n\u201cWe have perfected the tried and\ntested formula for producing fries\nthat have an aftertaste of fish, so why\nchange anything?\u201d\nHowever, one consultant was quick\nto point out that with no rent coming\nin from this hall, and the ever-rising\nprice of illegal MSG, refurbishing and\nstocking all these facilities may cost\nthousands.\nNane Jeary came up with a quick\nsolution however, and pointed out\nthat the unspent amenities fund from\nthis year was still lying around in\nher account. \u201cWith the money saved,\nwe could probably even chuck in a\nfew vending machines, although it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter if they work.\u201d\nThis jacket potato is too nice to serve in the former hall.

For\nexample, your trip across Central Asia\nis one I would love to do when I one\nday retire, although maybe not at the\nkind of pace you will be doing it!\nKM: There is always an element\nof danger in expeditions despite\nprecautions taken but has anything\never gone seriously wrong on one\nof the Board\u2019s expeditions?\nLC: It is sobering to read the report\nof the 1961 Beerenberg expedition\nto North Jan Mayen Island on which\nthere were five fatalities and the\nreport serves in part as a fitting\ntribute to those who perished. Most\nof the party had been to Svalbard,\noperating boats and mountaineering,\nthe previous year.\nThe expedition of 8 men had been\noperating as two parties, one in\nthe northwest and the other in the\nsouthwest of the island. Two of the\nnorthern party travelled by a small,\nrigid hulled, metal boat to pick up\nthe southern party. The outward\njourney had taken several hours. On\nthe return journey the wind got up,\nthey hit a sudden squall, the boat was\noverturned some 35 metres from\nthe shore. 5 out of 6 died; and even\nafter considerable searching only one\nbody was found. Other expeditions\nhave suffered the occasional accident\nand sadly fatality but not to such an\n\"I get most\nenjoyment\nout of\nwatching\nstudents\ndevelop\nwhen they\nreturn.\"\nextent.\nKM: Due to the expense of\nexpeditions, it seems they have\nhistorically been more of a rich\nperson\u2019s retreat. Do you feel this is\nstill the case?\nLC: Imperial College has always had\na tradition to support their students\nto undertake expeditions; this is the\nraison d\u2019etre for the Board\u2019s existence.\nHaving funding and approval from\nthe Board can open doors to Trust\nfunds and other charities.\nMany of the expeditions over the\nyears were undertaken by fund-raising, borrowing equipment, gifts of\nfood and equipment from suppliers,\nand finding a place to travel to within\ntheir means. These are all useful\nskills for future employment.\nMost expeditions can be completed\nwithin the budget of each individual\n\"It\u2019s a\nfantastic\nway to\ndevelop\nyour skills\nand have\na superb\ntime.\"\nstudent.\nIn some of the earlier expeditions\nstudents do not seem to have been\nconstrained by the need to find a\njob and some expeditions seemed to\nproceed at quite a leisurely pace.\nTake the expedition to Africa\nand the Americas in 1960 which\nran from March to November\ninvolving overland travel across\nboth continents undertaking a\nsurvey of private light aircraft and\ntheir activities. Nobody these days\nwould be likely to have the time and\nresources to undertake this type of\nexpedition.\nKM: Is there one place you have\nnever been that you would still\nlove to go to?\nLC: There are lots of wonderful places\nstill to go to, and the world is full of\nfantastic journeys that I would love to\nmake. It\u2019s impossible for me to pick\nout one! There are a whole host of\nplaces that I would love to visit, and\nhope to one day.\nKM: And what is your next\nadventure?\nLC: Travelling in the Arctic is a\nwonderful way to meet people who\noften later become your close friends.\nThis summer, with the help of some\nGreenlandic friends, I am travelling\nto a remote settlement in the north\nwest of Greenland, leaving loads\nof time for potential delays so that\nI am back in time for my College\ncommitments\u2026\nKM: Finally, what do you say to\nthose who may not have much\nexperience of expeditions but\nwould really love to go on one?\nLC: 18 expeditions applied to the\nImperial College Exploration Board\nthis year, of which 13 or 14 will go\nahead. If you have no experience\nat all, join one of the clubs or\nsocieties, which can be a great way\nto get to know others as well as build\nyour experience. Most Imperial\nexpeditions have a good legacy\ncomponent and you might find\nsomeone who will be looking for\nanother member of their expedition\nor will take you through the planning\nof one.

Like a train\nof ants, they follow a path as if\npreordained, in a robotic line with no\ndestination. I can feel the energy from\nmy plane window.\nDrugs. Violence. Human\ntrafficking. The typical Western news\ncycle on most developing nations\ninfluences the opinions of people\nabout Mexico more than most. India\nand China have oriental mysticism\nand South America has the untamed\nAmazon wilderness. Yet despite\nthe centuries of Mayan and Aztec\nculture interacting with European\ncolonists, press about Mexico is\nusually negative. Just weeks before\nI fly out I hear news that the bodies\nof 43 missing students have been\ndiscovered in nearby Guerrero state,\nin what looks like an orchestrated\nkilling. I lose count of the amount\nof friends and relatives trying to\nconvince me not to visit here, or to\nbook with a tour company, but I was\ndetermined to go.\nIt is freezing when I land. A stark\ncontradiction to the burnt out, barren\nvistas associated portrayed in the\nSpeedy Gonzalez cartoons. As my taxi\nwinds through the lamp lit streets I\nam surprised by how well maintained\nand organised the roads are, and the\nsmooth flow of traffic. My opening\nmeal is tacos al pastor, a local classic,\nand the perfect antidote to a hungry\nstomach.\nMorning brings a trip to the campus\nof Mexico\u2019s biggest university,\nUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de\nMexico, a sprawling mass of concrete\nunfolding over the area of a small\ncity. The campus has a faded, 1970\u2019s\naesthetic to it, but with open green\nspaces and mazy walkways it retains\nan air of languid intellectualism.\nComplex murals stretch across the\nsides of buildings; a melange of Aztec\nmyths and scientific discoveries\nblended so that neither appears\nincongruous.\nIf there is one form of artwork\nthat could define Mexico City it is\nthe murals. Broad splashes of colour\ndraped across walls both inside and\noutside grandiose buildings, forming\nany manner of scenes from the\nhistorical to the geographical to the\ndownright surreal. The main UNAM\ncampus in Ciudad Universitario is\none of the best examples, with the\nmain library exterior fully dedicated\nto a variety of artwork.\nTributes to Galileo and Copernicus\nare flanked by graphics of indigenous\nmyths, while a diagram of an atom\nis perched above a snapshot of a\nrevolutionary demonstration and\nother parts of the country\u2019s history.\nOne of the most striking murals\nis a magnificent eagle rising over\ntwo wrestling figures embedded in\nthe side of the Estadio Olimpico\nUniversitario, a so called \u20183D mural\u2019,\nfor the sculpture elements it brings to\nthe Mayan influenced architecture.\nLikewise both the Palacio Nacional\nand the Supreme Court are just\na couple of publicly accessible\nplaces whose interior corridors\nare decorated with murals by such\nluminaries as Diego Rivera, Jos\u00e9\nClemente Orozco and Arturo Garcia\nBustos. However, both are on under\npolice guard with no authorised\nentry. Developments in the case of\nthe 43 students have gripped the\nnation in a state of palpable fury,\nnot least because this particular\ncase exposed a sinister link between\npoliticians and the cartels. Public\nspaces and small parks everywhere\nare occupied by tents, protesters\ncamping out to put pressure on the\ngovernment for justice, and \u201c43\u201d is\ndaubed everywhere in graffiti. In\nconversation, most Mexicans express\na strong distaste for the police, and\nthis disconnect is magnified at\nfootball matches.\nWhile possessing an 80000 capacity\nthe stadium is not unusual for the\naverage North American university,\nfew if any can say they host a\nprofessional football team. Not least\none of the country\u2019s most storied and\nsuccessful ones: the Pumas of UNAM.\nA 3D mural by Diego Rivera thrusts\nout of the magnificent, stubborn\nconcrete bowl, its distinct indigenous\ninfluences only strengthening its\nimposing aura.

Gun toting police in\nfull riot armour peer grimly through\ntheir sunglasses as we are repeatedly\nchecked for contraband. Even belts\nare banned from the inside.\nThe resentment is tangible, the\nsafety checks pass without incident\nbarring the ejection of those with fake\ntickets.\nAlthough it seems that half the city\nis here, the two curvas at each end are\nempty apart from the visiting fans.\nI am positioned behind the ultras,\nthe Rebels, in the Pebetero stand\nunderneath where the Olympic flame\nwas lit all those years ago. The Rebels\nare on their feet for 90 minutes,\nwith intermittent bursts of silence\nbookending a never ending chorus of\nchants, led with the accompaniment\nof a drum and other instruments.\nThe chants of the Pumas fans\nare primarily support of their own\nteam, with the occasional obsession\nmocking of the opposition (or their\narch rivals Club Am\u00e9rica).

It is also interesting to note\nthat women comprise a significant\nportion of the ultras (or fanaticos\nas they are termed here), and are\noften leading the chants with gusto \u2013\nsomething almost unseen in Europe.\nIt is a reminder that there are some\nlessons concerning discrimination\nthat can be learned from less\ndeveloped nations.\nThe match finishes in a\ndisappointing 1-1 draw, with\nmoments of quality conspicuous by\ntheir absence apart from a sublime\nassist for Pumas\u2019 goal. Oddly, the feel\nof the match is almost exactly as I\nimagined from highlights of the 1970\nand 1986 football World Cups, aided\nby the constant, concussive energy\ngenerated by the indefatigable Pumas\nfans and The Rebels in particular. For\nan introduction to Latin American\nfootball, even a half full stadium\nhas been more exhilarating than I\nimagined.\nNo article about Mexico City would\nbe complete without mentioning\nthe legendary Frida Kahlo, who\nalong with her husband Diego\nRivera put Mexican art into the\nconsciousness of the world.

Written in 1921 by Luigi\nPirandello and first performed in\nthe same year to mixed reviews, I can\nonly imagine how startling it must\nhave been for audiences then, given\nhow radical it still is.\nRight from the beginning, it is\nclear that we are watching a play\nabout plays. A costume lady works\naway at her sewing machine while a\nscenic painter paints the set. Actors\nwalk around the stage rehearsing\nlines and the director storms in,\nhis instructions brisk. They are\nrehearsing for a Pirandello play and\nthere is an absurdist touch to the way\nthe actors are made to repeatedly\nrehearse a particularly inane scene.\nBeneath the playful, self-deprecating\nhumour, however (\u201cWe are reduced\nto staging Pirandello!\u201d), there is a\nserious question about the point of\ntheatre and how far removed it is\nfrom reality.\nThis idea is dramatically expanded\nupon the entrance of a group of\nsix characters who claim they have\nbeen abandoned by their author\nand are now seeking an alternative\nauthor to finish their story. Initially\nunwelcoming, the director is\nincreasingly drawn into their tragedy\nas they recount a tale of incest and\nguilt. He agrees to help them finish\ntheir story, but insists on his own\nactors learning their roles in order\nto stage it themselves. Disputes soon\narise as the actors re-enact their\nstory with comical exaggeration,\ninadvertently trivialising the raw\nguilt and shame of the characters as\nthe father unwittingly makes love to\nhis stepdaughter.\nBut how do the characters\nthemselves feel genuine emotion, if\nthey were birthed from an author\u2019s\nimagination? Fiction and reality\nhere is fluid, just as how time can\nstall and replay, the passions buried\nand resurfaced again and again. The\ncharacters insist that their suffering\nis real, and any attempt to replicate it\nwould be mockery. But is that not all\nof theatre \u2013 dramatic representations\nof real life? Or is it the other way\nround, as Shakespeare writes \u2013 all the\nworld\u2019s a stage, and all the men and\nwomen merely players?\nThe director, who was able to so\nprecisely control the piece he was\noriginally staging, realises that\nhe is rapidly losing control over\nthe six characters and their story.\nHis attempts to regain control are\nthwarted by their passions which take\nincreasingly free rein as the story\nprogresses.\nThere is also a question of\ndeterminism here; if the characters\u2019\nstories are unfinished, how do they\nknow what exactly should happen\nnext? Have their fates been sealed\nfrom the start? The director and\nactors can only look on in horror as\nthe characters march unstoppable\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville \u2013 Paris, Six Characters in Search of an Author.

On\nthe stage, as the audience are finding\ntheir seats, a young woman is sitting\nbefore a backdrop of rubble and\nbroken furniture, on an otherwise\nbare stage. She is smiling contentedly\nwhilst playing with some scraps of\ncloth, and needle and thread. How\ncan I begin to understand this image\nin front of me, and the world it\u2019s\nassociated with: the world of Alia\nAlzougbi, of countless children, with\ncountless mothers and fathers, a\nworld of revolution and conflict. A\ndistant land to which I am a voyeur,\nfollowing it\u2019s ebb and flow through\ninternational news. Kay Adshead \u2013\nthe writer and director of this first\nstaging of the play \u2013 has found a way.\nThe audience\u2019s apathy is\nundermined throughout the show.\nAt the start of the play Alia Alzougbi,\nwho reminds me of a lonely child,\nisolated but for the phantoms of\nher imagination, verbalises her\ndisillusionment with her country\u2019s\nruling class through puppetry. She\nengages the audience with humour,\nbut underlying her jokes there is a\ndesperate young lady vying for our\nattention and trying to find a voice.\nThe play offers anecdotes of the\nArab Spring in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya\nand Syria, as well as Camberwell\nin South London. In every scene\nthe women are railing against the\ndenial of their freedom of speech\nand their incapacity to make change\nin the Arab world. The words of\nthe characters on stage describe the\nbrutality that the protesters were\nsubjected to, the repugnant designs\nof dictators, the victimisation of\nchildren in war, and how the women\nin the Arab Spring dealt with these\nissues.\nThe acting was sometimes\nunconvincing, but otherwise\nfulfilled its function, and at points\nAlia Alzougbi was exceptional. The\nsimplicity of the set worked well, as\nit didn\u2019t distract the audience, while\nthe size of the theatre allowed for an\nintimate viewing experience.\nThe script is infused with powerful\nimagery and mesmerising poetry,\nwhich leaves no question of the\nplaywright\u2019s artistic understanding\nof the play\u2019s deeply political subject.\nFeminist issues are intrinsic to the\nplay, but do not distract from the\nstories themselves. It seems that the\nauthor is challenging not only the\ninequality of power between men\nand women, but also the inequality\nbetween women in the Western\nand Arab worlds. The play doesn\u2019t\naggressively argue a political point,\nbut instead lucidly shows us the\nplight of women and children in the\nArab Spring, and in its penultimate\nscene conscientiously dissects\nthe difficulties of respectfully\ncommunicating this bloody conflict\non the stage.\nThe Singing Stones is being performed\nat the Arcola Theatre until the 28th\nof\nFebruary.\nAlso, the Theatre is working towards\nbeing the first carbon neutral theatre\nin the world. So when you see the\nproduction and find your conscience\nbeing challenged, at least you won\u2019t need\nto worry so much about how far the polar\nice caps have receded in the process.\ntowards their inevitable tragic\nends. The scenes are appropriately\naccompanied by eerie, bone-chilling\nmusic that sets the surreal feel of the\nwhole play.\nOriginally written in Italian, this\nproduction was in French with\nEnglish subtitles. The cast delivers an\nelectrifying performance, and there\nis clever use of the stage and sets. A\nmakeshift stage is wheeled on and we\nobserve the very process of adapting\n\u2018reality\u2019 for stage \u2013 the physical\nrepresentation of the metatheatre it\nis.\nShadows are used to great effect,\nrepresenting the almost mythical\ncharacter of Madam Pace, who forced\nthe stepdaughter into prostitution,\nas well as the burden of the tragedy\non each forlorn character at the end\nof the play. A section of the stage juts\nout into the audience, and it is here\nthat the director sits as he watches the\ncharacters take their story into their\nown hands further upstage, joining\nthe audience as a spectator himself.\nDirector Emmanuel DemarcyMota\u2019s production is remarkably\nfaithful to the text, but at the same\ntime it takes advantage of modern\nstaging techniques that make the\nexperience an immersive one. No\ndoubt the story is bizarre, yet the\nquestions it raises are as relevant to\ntheatre today as they ever were.\nSix Characters in Search of an Author\nwas on at the Barbican Centre until 7th\nFebruary\n\n"

Rarely\ndo you find an exhibition as all-encompassing as this show of the\nbest of the Royal Photographic\nSociety\u2019s (RPS) collection. Besides\nincluding instantly recognizable\nphotos, such as Steve McCurry\u2019s\nNational Geographic magazine cover\nphoto Afghan Girl, the exhibition\nis notable for its effort to present a\nmacroscopic view of photographic\nhistory, drawing links across time,\nindividuals and whole movements.\nThe Society is in a unique position\nas both bystander and participant in\nthe major photographic milestones of\nhistory, and this exhibition exploits\nboth these roles ingeniously to create\na fascinating and informative tribute\nto the art of photography.\nThe show is divided into three\nsections, each of which reveals a\ndifferent facet of photographic\nhistory. \u2018Continuity and Change\u2019\njuxtaposes similar subject matter in\nphotos from different time periods\nand photographers, creating a\nlively dialogue between works that\ntranscends time and context. The\nstreaker held by three policemen in\nED Lacey\u2019s photo, for example, and\nthe naked children in James Jarche\u2019s\nLimbs who are also running away\nfrom an officer, unite in a playful\ndefiance of social decorum.\nAcross history, there have been\ncertain recurrent themes that\nphotographers consistently return to,\nand this particular room highlights\nthese similarities very strikingly.\nFrom the curvaceous bodies of\nnudes across time to journalistic\nphotographs of uncannily similar\ncompositions of spectators at a\nbadminton match and bystanders at\na policeman\u2019s funeral, photographs\nhave captured the timelessness of\nthe human condition. Particularly\ndelightful is the 1956 piece by\nPhilippe Halsman. Inspired by the\njump shots of comedians of the time,\nhe got the Duke and Duchess of\nWindsor to do one too \u2013 which they\ngamely did, while maintaining their\nair of composure and dignity!\nThe RPS, founded in 1853, is the\nworld\u2019s oldest surviving photographic\nsociety and its early members consists\nof the most famous practitioners\nof the time such as Hugh Welch\nDiamond and Roger Fenton. It held\nits first open exhibition at The South\nKensington Museum in 1858, which\nlater became the Science Museum\nand Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThe second room of the exhibition\nis dedicated to the photographs\nand photographers themselves\nthat represent the \u2018Optimism and\nProgress\u2019 of the 1850s, a period when\nphotographic techniques and the\nrole of photography in society was\ndeveloping rapidly.\nTrue to its role as a participant in\nthe history of photography, the RPS\nalso has a remarkable collection of\nphotos of photographers themselves.\nIn the 1856 piece Photographic Society\nouting to Hampton Court, a cluster of\nmen in top hats are pictured in front\nof a carriage, chatting and setting up\nequipment on a patch of grass \u2013 a\ncandid but vivid capture of the spirit\nof the early RPS. Madame Yevonde\u2019s\nself-portrait with a Vivex colour\ncamera encompasses the concept of\nthis section of the exhibition \u2013 a focus\non the drivers and technology that\nshaped the time. In the centre of the\nroom, there is a recreation of a section\nof a photography exhibition as it\nwould have looked in the 1850s, with\nphotos densely arranged and with\nsubject matter ranging from busts at\nthe British Museum to landscapes.\nAside from photographs, the\nexhibition also displays a collection\nof equipment significant to the\ndevelopment of photography. Three\nrare original Ni\u00e8pce heliographs \u2013\nthe first time someone attempted to\n\u2018draw by light\u2019 \u2013 are on display, along\nwith Henry Talbot\u2019s camera lucida\nsketchbook and a portable camera of\nthe 1850s, among others.\nIn \u2018Personal Vision\u2019, the third and\nfinal room of the exhibition, works\nby the same photographer are shown\nside by side. Some of these have a\ndistinct character and highlight\nthe similarities across works by the\nsame photographer \u2013 for example,\nthe gentle, otherworldly landscapes\nof Ansel Adams or the quirky and\nwhimsical pictures of Richard Polak.\nOthers are vastly different and show\nthe diverse interests of individual\nphotographers. Roger Fenton, best\nknown for his photos of the Crimean\nWar, also took remarkable still life\nand landscape pictures. This room\nis thus an interesting companion to\nthe first room \u2013 one connects the\ndots between subject matter while the\nother invites the viewer to pick out\nthe \u201cpersonal visions\u201d of individual\nphotographers\u2019 bodies of work.\nDrawn by Light is impressively\ncomprehensive, with a diverse range\nof style and subject across time and\nplace. Pioneers of photography\nare displayed alongside recent\nmasterpieces, capturing an exquisite\nview of photography in its entirety.\nDrawing from the collection of such a\nhistoric organization, the exhibition\nstrikes a fine balance between being\ninformative and aesthetic. At the\nsame time, it presents its art in a\ncohesive way that challenges any\npreconceived notions of individual\nphotographic movements and\nphotographers that viewers may come\nin with.\nWell-organised and easy to\nnavigate, the RPS collection is\ndefinitely a fascinating and enjoyable\nvisit.\nDrawn by Light: The Royal\nPhotographic Society Collection is\nrunning until 11th\nMarch in the Science\nMuseum Media Space.

It is mostly found in\nblack grapes (and thus red wine) but it is also found in\nfoods such as blueberries,raspberries,dark chocolate\nand peanuts.\nResveratrol is an antioxidant,a compound that\nprevents the formation of free radicals in the body,\nwhich have been linked to cancer. Its potential health\neffects have made it the subject of a huge amount of\nresearch in recent years,with many studies on cells and\nin animals showing promising findings.\nIn vitro,it has been observed that it suppresses the\nproliferation of tumour cells,by penetrating the cell and\nhelps DNA repair from free-radical damage that may\notherwise lead to a tumour.It has been found to inhibit\nthe formation of inflammatory factors and reduce\ncholesterol levels,suggesting it could have a role in\npreventing heart disease.\nThese potential benefits have led some to suggest the\nconsumption of red wine may be behind the\u201cFrenchParadox\u201d: how French people have low incidence of\ncardiovascular diseases while consuming large amounts\nof saturated fats. Red wine,though,contains far lower\nconcentrations of resveratrol than have been given to\nhuman volunteers in some small-scale clinical trials.\nAnd what should also not be neglected is that most of\nthe trials for the beneficial effects for resveratrol have\nbeen tested mostly in animals,and the experimentation\nin humans is limited.\nUnfortunately,resveratrol may not be as perfect as\nconsidered,since resveratrol supplements have been\nfound to cause pancreas abnormalities in fetuses when\nconsumed by pregnant monkeys,in experimental trials.\nAnd also despite all these potential benefits,this does\nnot mean that drinking excess red wine can offer these\nhealth effects.As the ancient Greeks said\u201cpan metron\nariston\u201d,meaning all in moderation,we should not\nforget that red wine contains alcohol so can cause liver\ndisease and also increase the risk for heart disease.\nNEFELI MARIA SKOUFU PAPOUTSAKI\n\"Making\nammonia\nuses nearly\n2% of global\nenergy\nsupply.\"\n\"Fertilisers,\nas well as\nplants,\ncould be\nderived\nfrom energy\nfrom the\nsun.\"\nEvery nitrogen atom in every\nchemical used by people\noriginates from nitrogen\ngas (N2\n) in the atmosphere, and\nthis plethora of different uses is\nall accessed from one molecule:\nammonia.\nThe production of ammonia\nfrom N2\nis a fundamental chemical\ntransformation called nitrogen\nfixation. Plants need nitrogen to\ngrow, and the major anthropogenic\nuse of ammonia is to produce the\nfertilisers essential to boosting crop\nyields, in order to feed the world\u2019s\ngrowing population.\nAs well as being important,\nnitrogen fixation is also extremely\ndifficult, because N2\nis very, very\nunreactive. In N2\nthe two nitrogen\natoms are connected by a strong triple\nbond, which must be broken to form\nammonia.\nUnlike other molecules with triple\nbonds, it is the very first stage of\nbreaking the N2\ntriple bond which is\nthe hardest part, limiting the possible\napproaches significantly. In fact, N2\nis so stubbornly unreactive in almost\nevery measurable way it is used as\nan inert gas in food preservation,\nincandescent light bulbs, and aviation\nfuel tanks.\nConsequently, all current nitrogen\nfixation happens with a huge energy\ncost. Man-made ammonia via the\nHaber-Bosch process uses massive\ntemperatures and pressures (400o\nC\nand 250 atmospheres) to drive the\nreaction. This one process uses nearly\n2% of the entire global energy supply.\nIn nature, enzymes called\nnitrogenases have evolved over\nbillions of years to catalyse the\nconversion at ambient temperature\nand pressure. This sounds better, but\nstill needs a vast amount of energy (in\nthe form of ATP) to work. A perfect\nnitrogen fixer would work efficiently\nat mild conditions, or be coupled\nto some plentiful renewable energy\nsource, but has eluded all attempts at\nidentification.\nA new development addressing\nthis has recently been reported by\nKanatzidis and co-workers, inspired\nby a \u2018crazy idea\u2019 and a biomimetic\napproach. They copied the mixture\nof elements doing the work in\nnitrogenase (iron, molybdenum and\nsulphur), and prepared a chalcogel;\na high surface area network that\nmodels a \u2018solid state\u2019 nitrogenase.\nThe clusters of atoms in the\nchalcogel strongly absorb light, and\ncrucially, are able to absorb in the\nultraviolet region. This causes high\nenergy excitations in the clusters, and\nKanatzidis found that this energy\ncould be harnessed to break the N2\nbond, leading to ammonia formation.\nThere are a couple of really great\nthings about this work. Firstly, the\nconcept works extremely well from an\nenergy point of view. A system which\nworks at ambient conditions, and\nuses an abundant, renewable energy\nsource to pay the high cost of splitting\nN2\nhas a lot to be said for it.\nSecondly, the chalcogels did not\nlose their activity over time, a highly\ndesirable property when designing\na catalyst. The whole process also\nuses water as the solvent, making it\ngreener than a ChemDraw logo.\nAs well as these good things,\nhowever, there are also drawbacks.\nThe N2\nsplitting works well, but the\nactual ammonia formation uses\nsacrificial chemical sources of H+\nand e- (essential components of N2\nfixation), and is not as elegant as\ncurrent routes.\nThe real trouble, thougwh, is the\nrate of the process. At just about\na thousand times slower than\nnitrogenase, this system would have\ndifficulty delivering the 200,000,000\ntonnes of ammonia we use annually.\nThe authors are confident\nthat further work will deliver\nsignificant improvement in this area\n(improvement, in fact, they say has\nalready started). So watch this space,\nand let this current report be an\ninteresting proof of concept, en route\nto an appealing scenario where our\nfertilisers, as well as the plants, are\nderived from energy from the sun.\nDOI: abs/10.1021/ja512491v\nFound in grapes and other fruits, in vitro tests of resveratrol have\nshown positive effects on cell health.

Opera houses\nmust offer enlarged orchestras, vast\ncrowds of singer-actors, numerous\nsets, and the scores demand almost\nsuperhuman abilities from the\nprinciple cast. With this production,\nthe English National Opera has\ncreated something that delivers all\nthis, and fully lives up to the mind-blowing depths of Wagner\u2019s vision.\nBriefly sketched, our comic story\nconcerns a wandering knight,\nWalther, who must win a song\ncontest in order to marry the lovely\nEva. Eva\u2019s father is a member of\nthe Mastersingers Guild (a true\nhistorical guild), and has initiated\nthe competition on condition that\nthe singer be judged according to\nthe rules of the guild. Walther is\nnot a member of the guild and has\nno knowledge of its strict rules and\ntraditions. Furthermore, he is up\nagainst the scheming town clerk\nBeckmesser, who is desperate to win\nand who holds the role of \u2018marker\u2019 for\nthe guild, although he lacks talent.\nLuckily, the benevolent cobbler Hans\nSachs, also a mastersinger, recognises\nthe love between Eva and Walther\nand is willing to help them succeed.\nAgainst this backdrop of medieval\nNuremberg, with its artistic guilds,\nWagner spins a masterful web of\nverse & music that explores the\nvalue, purpose & social role of art.\nThe masterstroke is the use of art to\ndiscuss art and in doing so Wagner\u2019s\nscore is both daringly modern and\nfirmly rooted in operatic tradition \u2013\nas is the song performed by Walther\nand written under Sachs\u2019s instruction.\nThe score cleverly performs the\ndual function of simultaneously\nillustrating and commenting on the\nvarious musical philosophies of the\ncharacters. It is musically innovative\nin the manner expected of Wagner:\na continuous unending texture of\nmotifs bound together with the most\nexpressive harmony imaginable.\nYet, Wagner uses old devices that\nhe dismissed in his writings and\nabandoned in his other work for their\ncontrivance: rhymed verse, quintets,\narias \u2013 opera by numbers \u2013 and even\na short ballet in the third act. The\nresulting music is so expressive that it\ncan somehow encompass antithetical\nstates simultaneously, or carry the\nfull and undivided force of love,\nNicky Spence as David and Andrew Shore as Sixtus Beckmesser in Wagner\u2019s The Mastersingers of Nuremberg at the London Coliseum. Photo: Tristram Kenton\nrapture or anxiety, depending on the\nstage action. On top of all this, The\nMastersingers is surprisingly hilarious!\nThe plot is full of antitheses.\nThe rigid traditionalism of the\nMastersinger\u2019s Guild is at odds\nwith Walther\u2019s free & spontaneous\nexpression through song. Their\nsophisticated and exclusive art\nbattles against the coarse music of\nthe illiterate, which has broad appeal\namong Nuremberg\u2019s public. What\nWagner tells us and demonstrates\nfor us, through his mediator Hans\nSachs, is that art should take a middle\nground between these oppositions.\nIt should speak directly to people\n\n"

Students\nwere able to purchase a ticket for\n\u00a335, and were then required to raise\na further \u00a340 in sponsorship before\nthrowing themselves from the crane\nparked between Queen\u2019s Lawn and\nthe Sherfield Building.\nOver 140 students and staff took\npart in the bungee jump, including\nsome visiting from other London\nuniversities.

Sorry\nto everyone who heard me shout\nprofanities across Queen\u2019s Lawn as I\nfell!\u201d\nThe RAG Week Launch also took\nplace during Monday lunchtime,\nwhich saw the RAG Chair and also\nAlice Gast give speeches about RAG\nand plans for the week.\nAlice Gast said afterwards to Felix:\n\u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful to see students\nand staff from across the College\ncommunity come together to support\nRAG.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed by all\nthose who\u2019ve given their time and\nenergy to raise money for good causes,\nparticularly the RAG committee\nvolunteers who\u2019ve pulled together the\nweek\u2019s events.\u201d\nSenior College staff came together\nto make pancakes for students, whilst\nthe Royal College of Science Union\n(RCSU) lent out their own candyfloss\nmachine to RAG to produce yellow\nand pink candyfloss for students\nwatching the bungee jump.\nCollege staff have also been seen\nsporting custom made RAG hoodies\naround campus this week, with Vice\nProvost (Education) Debra Humphris\nsporting her bright pink number\nwhen she attended Union Council on\nTuesday.\nIn fact, staff involvement with\nRAG seems to have reached an all\ntime high this year; Professor Tom\nWelton, Dean of Faculty of Natural\nSciences, was seen walking over hot\ncoals for charity on Thursday evening\ntoo, raising \u00a3160 in the process.\nThe Firewalk, where participants\nwalked across burning hot coals\nbarefoot, is a new edition to RAG\nweek, but proved popular. The\ncoals, as the supervisor explained,\nwas heated to around 600 degrees\nFahrenheit (around 315 Celsius) \u2013\nthis being \u201ctwice\u201d the temperature\nthat skin melts at.\nAll participants were awarded a\ncertificate for their efforts, and got\nto cross the coals twice following a\nbrief information session. The Dean\nof the Faculty of Natural Sciences,\nTom Welton, said, \u201cI was amazed,\nit was more painful standing on the\ncold stone than walking across the hot\ncoals.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cI\u2019d do it again \u2013\nI\u2019m glad I did it first and not last \u2013\nstanding in the queue and watching\npeople do it would have.\u201d When asked\nif he had any comments on RAG this\nyear, he concluded, \u201cRAG is fab, it\u2019s\ngreat that it raises a lot of money, but\nthe really important thing about it is\npeople take the opportunity to think\nabout other people\u201d.\nTunnel tours under the campus and\ntrips up the Queen\u2019s Tower also were\norganised and ran by RAG.\nStudents could explore the disused\ntunnels that snake underneath\ncampus and stretch to South\nKensington and beyond, or, if they\nprefer heights but didn\u2019t fancy the\nbungee jump, could head to the top of\nQueen\u2019s Tower instead.\nOn Thursday evening, RAG also\nran their traditional Masquerade\nValentines Ball, with a \u00a34,000 bar\ntab. The Ball was held in Under the\nBridge, a club in Fulham, which, as\nthe name suggests, is indeed under a\nbridge.\nOther clubs and societies have\nalso got involved in raising money;\nthe Science Fiction and Fantasy\nSociety held a book sale with all\nproceeds being donated to RAG,\nthe IC Dodgeball team ran a charity\ntournament, and many clubs also\nposed naked for the RAG charity\ncalendar. Various departments have\nalso run bake sales, with the proceeds\ngoing to RAG too.\nImperial RAG joined forces with\nthe Royal College of Music (RCM),\nwhose RAG Week coincided with\nImperial\u2019s. The RCM hosted a poker\nnight, which raised several hundred\npounds, and saw students from both\ncolleges playing late into the night.\nThe Oxford RAG society has also\nteamed with Imperial RAG for\nthe Megaraid this weekend, with\nstudents travelling up to Oxford to\nraise money there.\nFelix spoke to Arran Sayers, the\nRAG Vice Chair (Operations) and the\nRAG Champion for CGCU, about\nhow the team had come together and\nmade the week possible.\n\u201cEveryone has put their heart and\nsoul into helping out this week.\n\u201cThe Week has been a great success.\nI\u2019m extremely happy with all that has\nhappened and all the money that has\nbeen raised.\u201d\nSayers is also shaving his head at\nthe end of the week for Alzheimer\u2019s\nSociety, after his grandmother sadly\ndied due to the disease.\nSayers is planning to shave his hair\non Queen\u2019s Lawn during lunchtime,\nalthough he is quite nervous about\nit. \u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to look a\nRAG Chair Ben Fernando takes donations and left, whilst people buy doughnuts and chocolate nearby (bottom).

Famine. Conflict. As\nimages of these atrocities jump\nout of me from black and white\nphotos adorning the walls of The\nPhotographers\u2019 Gallery, the words\nof polemical anti-colonialist Frantz\nFanon ring in my mind. In his most\nfamous work, The Wretched of the\nEarth, he advocates for those who are\ncolonised to use violence as a tool for\npolitical freedom. While Fanon sees\nconflict as a necessity, the exhibition\nHuman Rights Human Wrongs shows\nthat it seems to be an inevitability: a\nside effect of living on our fractured\nplanet.\nTaking the 1948 Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights as a\nstarting point, The Photographers\u2019\nGallery explores the archive of the\nBlack Star Photography Agency,\nwho are legendary for their\nphotojournalism. Picking a collection\nof photographs from numerous\nconflicts of the last 60 years, the\nexhibition spans the globe, in what\nis quite possibly the most depressing\nworld tour; starved Biafran orphans\nstaring forlornly out at the lens;\nwomen marching in the Plaza de\nMayo in Argentina, highlighting their\nplight as the mothers of \u2018disappeared\u2019\nchildren; and Algerian bards, singing\nballads against French colonialism in\nTunisia during protests.\nWith Selma being released in\ncinemas to critical acclaim, it\nseems a ripe time to revisit the civil\nrights campaign, and photographs\nof Martin Luther King by Charles\nMoore and Bob Fitch help humanise\nthe legend, revealing the edges that\nwere smoothed away in his journey\nto become an icon. Other photos\nallow us to starkly draw a link\nbetween the present and the past,\nwith Willie Nkosi\u2019s photograph of\nblack protesters in Soweto during\nthe late 1970s reminding us of recent\nscenes in Ferguson. The signs around\ntheir necks read \u201cDon\u2019t shoot. We\nare marching. We are not fighting\u201d,\nshowing us that then, as now, black\nbodies are not safe from the force of\nan imperialist government.\nHowever, with many of these\nphotos there is a sense of \u2018been\nthere, done that\u2019. As Susan Sontag\nsays: \u201cImages transfix. Images\nanaesthetize\u201d. In our media-saturated\nworld it has become difficult for an\nimage to retain the power to shock,\nto stun. While it is imaginable that\nthese images caused a furore when\nthey were first published, revealing\na hidden reality, globalisation has\nmeant that rather than being placed\nout of view, such acts are instead\nthrust upon us.\nThis attitude is not helped by the\nway the photographs are presented;\ninstead of presenting them\nchronologically, or geographically,\nwe flit around, from one place to\nanother. Starting off in Vietnam, we\nmight then head to Alabama in the\n\u201860s, then Algeria, then Morocco in\nthe \u201870s, and then back to Vietnam.\nWhile I understand that this may\nhave been a deliberate ploy to\noverwhelm us with the sheer volume\nof horror humanity can produce,\nthe effect is actually that we become\ndisorientated, and the narrative that\nwe have been building is fractured.\nThe exhibition succeeds where\nit presents a view of the world that\nwe are unfamiliar with; the power\nof great photography is that it can\nalter the way that we perceive what\nis happening around us, and this is\nclear in the photographs that explore\nhow women are treated within war.\nIn one photo from Vietnam we see\na group of white soldiers engaging\nwith local women, who we presume\nto be prostitutes. The slack-jawed\ngrins plastered on the faces of the\nAmericans is sickening, and as we\ngaze at them gazing at the women, it\nis difficult to feel anything other than\nsheer disgust.\nIn one photo, things are taken\nfurther; as well as the photographs\nwe are told the captions written on\nthe back; in this one an Angolan\nwoman stares out at the camera,\nand the caption tells us that \u201cshe\nmakes propaganda for a black-white\ncommunity\u201d. While this view seems\nsomewhat optimistic, it is certainly a\nnovelty in an exhibition that seems to\nbe lacking in new ideas.\nThe lack of context for many of\nthe photos is also an issue; unless\nyou have a generally good idea of\nthe innumerable conflicts since\n1948, it can be difficult to tell what\nis happening in the photograph.\nHowever, some ideas are universal;\nin my favourite photograph of the\nexhibition, entitled Red China, a\nwoman stares forlornly at a pair\nof shoes, her tired eyes and worn\nclothing contrasting against the\nglamour of the Western-style\naccessories. It is a reminder that not\nall conflicts involve bloodshed, and\nnot all injustice concerns violence.\nOnce you have been emotionally\ndrained by these harrowing\nphotographs, you can head down to\nthe Photographers\u2019 Gallery\u2019s other\nexhibition, which offers a welcome\nchange of tone. Anima and the Wildest\nPrairies, the first UK solo exhibition\nby Dutch photographer Charlotte\nDumas, displays a collection of\nphotographs of wild horses living in\nNevada. Framed against a wide-open\nSouthern sky that stretches across\nthe photograph, powerful horses\nwander free, exemplifying the power\nand might of the natural world. With\nnary a human in sight, Dumas\u2019 work\nis an exploration of man vs. machine.\nThe natural might of the mountains\nand the glamourous majesty of the\nanimals suggests that they have the\nedge.\nBut what is more impressive is\nDumas\u2019 work Anima, a video of the\nhorses used for military funerals in\nthe USA falling asleep in their stables.\nFramed like classical paintings,\nDumas\u2019 skill with light is apparent,\nevoking the memory of the old\nmasters; observing these horses as\nthey slowly drift into dreamland feels\nlike a sort of transgression, as if we\nare trespassing on private property.\nIt\u2019s the kind of work that I could\nwatch for an age: slow, deliberate,\nand beautiful. It also gives us a time\nto reflect on the things I have seen\nupstairs in the Human Right Human\nWrongs exhibition. After the horrors\nof the human world, it\u2019s a welcome\nrelief to be able to slip into a tranquil,\nanimal one.\nHuman Rights Human Wrongs and\nCharlotte Dumas: Anima and the\nWildest Prairies are both on at The\nPhotographers\u2019 Gallery until 6th\nApril.\nFree Admission\n\"The\nexhibition\nshows\nviolence\nas an\ninevitability\nof living on\nour fractured\nplanet\"\n\"Dumas\u2019 skill\nwith light\nis apparent,\nand evokes\nthe memory\nof the old\nmasters\"\nHilmar Pabel, Czechoslovakia Invasion, Prague, August 21 1968 Collection.\nPhoto: The Black Star Collection\nUntitled, from the series Anima, 2012 Photo: Charlotte\nDumas\n\n"

The Mastersingers\nboth espoused this philosophy and\nembodied it with great success;\nwithin a year it was performed all\nover Germany and became a symbol\nfor the unification of the country. In\nmodern Britain, it is hard to imagine\nhow an opera \u2013 a form seen as elitist \u2013\ncould have such relevance. Although\nI doubt it will change this fact, the\nENO\u2019s new production should enjoy\nbroad appeal, and handles the finer\npoints with tact. History has tainted\nThe Mastersingers\u2019 reputation, and\npresented problems for directors.\nHaving been appropriated by the\nNazi party, Sachs\u2019 final monologue\nhas been dressed in rather sinister\nclothes. After celebrating the value of\nthe guild\u2019s traditions and the German\ncultural heritage, Sachs warns of\nforeign influence: \u201cWhat is German\nand true none would know, if it did\nnot live in the honour of German\nmasters.\u201d\nThroughout the 20th\nCentury,\nmany directors, particularly in\nAmerica, have decided to cut this\nscene or intervene in other ways,\nAndrew Shore (Sixtus Beckmesser) and Gwyn Hughes Jones (Walter von Stolzing) in The\nMastersingers of Nuremberg Photo: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian\nfearing its nationalistic tone. It is\nhowever, important to understand\nthat these words would have\nsounded very different in 19th\nCentury Germany than they do to\nus in a post-Nazi Europe. A more\nsympathetic interpretation of the\nmonologue might be suggested. As\nwe have discussed, Wagner often\nwrites on the importance of art as a\ncommunication between people of\nshared cultural & linguistic heritage.\nHe believed that German art could\nonly provide all its riches to German\npeople, who would share in a rich\nset of cultural contexts necessary\nto fully understand it. This applies\nto any group of people, and while\nnot entirely innocent, this view is\ncertainly far less sinister than those\ncirculated in the early 20th\nCentury.\nIn this ENO production, the director,\nRichard Jones, has dealt with the issue\nintelligently and appropriately. As\nthe opera closes, the Nurembergers\nhold up the faces of German cultural\nheroes: composers, artists, writers,\nfilmmakers, actors and architects;\nand celebrate their contributions to\nhuman thought.\nJones shows his intelligence and\nskill throughout. The production is\nslick, dynamic and frequently very\nfunny. The sets seem to depict some\nsort of simplified reality, but retain\ndetail where it matters. The crowds\nare used brilliantly to depict in one\nmoment a chaotic riot, and at the\nother the solemn uniformity of the\nchurch \u2013 the chorus is excellent.\nMusically, Edward Gardner conducts\na modern Mastersinger, shedding\nthe bombast and weight of previous\ninterpretations in favour of flexibility\nand sensitivity. The orchestra has\nmoments of utter brilliance, and\nonly loses its composure when the\non-stage brass is added to the mix\n\u2013 a crucial mistake which I trust\nwill be addressed in subsequent\nperformances.\nAll the cast is excellent but, as\nis understandable in such a long\nperformance, shows inconsistencies\nhere and there. Gwyn Hugh Jones\nplays a passionate and pre-occupied\nWalther. His love, Eva, is portrayed\nby Rachel Nicholls with grace, but\nperhaps she lacks the spontaneity\nthat would really allow us to relate\nto her character. The antagonist,\nBeckmesser (Andrew Shore), was\nhandled less well, although the blame\nfor this should lie with the director.\nHis humiliation in the second act\nis so complete and absolute that his\nfurther scheming in the third seems\nforced and incongruent. Wagner\u2019s\ngreat coup of world-play at the finale,\nwhich should serve to finally rule out\nBeckmesser\u2019s pretensions, is served\nweak and cruel. In fact, due to the\ntranslation to English the genius of\nthis scene is missed entirely.\nI do have to say that Shore plays\nthe part with near-perfect comedic\ninstincts and has the voice to\nmatch. Hans Sachs is of course\nthe keystone in the opera, and, in\none of the longest roles in operatic\nexistence, he sees what others do not\nsee and manoeuvres the story to its\nconclusion. Iain Paterson debuts\nin this marathon and does so with\nstunning confidence and humanity \u2013\nhe is sure to become one of the great\nWagner singers of his generation.\nI am sure that the name of Richard\nWagner has passed over your ears\nat some point or another. In any\ncase, you will have felt his influence,\nwhether in film music or more\nacademic genres. If you are at all\ncurious, this is the production to see.\nIt is not only enjoyable and funny,\nbut deals with Wagner\u2019s difficult\nthemes head-on, with sophistication,\nand a no-nonsense approach.\nThe Mastersingers of Neurenberg is on\nuntil the 10th\nMarch. Tickets available\nonline.\nNicky Spence as David (left) and Andrew Shore as Beckmesser (right) in the Mastersingers of\nNuremberg Photo: Alastair Muir/REX\n\"The ENO\nhas created\nsomething\nthat fully\nlives up to\nthe mind-blowing\ndepths of\nWagner\u2019s\nvision.\"\n\"The\nENO\u2019s new\nproduction\nshould\nenjoy\nbroad\nappeal, and\nhandles\nthe finer\npoints with\ntact.\"\n\n"

On the\nother hand, places like the Atacama\ndesert in Chile, the Southwest USA\nas already mentioned, vast swathes\nof Africa, parts of China and most\nof Australia could be ideal locations\nfor CPV with their near-constant\nsupplies of sunlight.\nCurrently, CPV is only taking baby\nsteps into the market with analyst\nhouse IHS predicting that only\naround 800MWp will be installed in\nthe US by 2020 compared to around\n7,000MWp in China alone if it is to\nmeet targets set by its 13th Five-Year\nPlan. Nevertheless, CPV systems\nhave huge potential with MJ cells\nthat have a scarily high theoretical\nmaximum efficiency of 86%. Already\nfor CPV, China has comfortably the\nlargest projects in the world with two\n55+MWp plants in Qinghai province\nalone.\nSolar does Yoga\nCPV and c-Si PV are both very flat\nand modular. Exploring alternatives,\nsome of the more creative emerging\ntechnologies, such as Perovskite cells\nand organic solar dyes employ more\nflexible designs and applications for\nsolar PV.\nStarting with Perovskite, as a\ntechnology which received lots of\ninitial attention in the \u201890s, interest\nin the technology has increased\nparticularly in the last few years,\nwith Nature calling Perovskite solar\ncell growth \u2018one-to-watch\u2019 in 2014.\nIn part, this interest has come from\na rapid increase in efficiency from\n3.8% in 2009 to around 20% now,\ncoupled with potentially much less\nintensive and cheaper manufacturing\nprocesses than c-Si. Although\nthis efficiency is obviously low\nwhen compared to CPV, studies by\nOxford Energy have suggested that\nPerovskite cells could compete with\ncurrent Thin-Film technologies\nthat have comparable efficiencies\nof 19-20%. Whilst this is certainly\nbeneficial to overall competitiveness,\nPerovskite\u2019s real trump card comes\nin its flexibility of application. With\nan emphasis on diversity, Perovskite\ncells can be coloured in translucent\nglass, integrated into buildings\n(so-called Building Integrated PV)\nand windows and even used as\ncheap lasers according to research\nby the University of Cambridge.\nIn this sense, the PV market has\nthe potential to be opened up to\nwhole new sectors including those\nthat involve aesthetic and stylistic\ndecisions about materials such as the\nconstruction industry.\nGoing even further, organic solar\ndyes have the potential to be printed\nout onto thin polymers producing\nreams of solar film at low cost and\nlow environmental impact. As may\nbe expected, the efficiencies of these\nkinds of films are typically too low\nto be competitive with conventional\nsolar markets. But \u2013 and this is\nperhaps the whole point of these\ntechnologies \u2013 if such innovative\ndesigns can capture the public\nimagination, maybe they will not\nhave to. Already there has been the\ncontroversial project to build \u2018solar\nroads\u2019 in USA, which some even\n(wrongly) thought was a hoax when it\nsought crowdfunding. With this new\nwave of PV technologies then, there\nis genuine intrigue as applications of\nthe technology are starting to move\nwell beyond the realms of traditional\npower generation.\nFuture Potential and a Bright\nNew Dawn\nPerhaps the most interesting\naspect of these third generation PV\ntechnologies is that they do not have\nmany aspects in common. Where\nCPV seeks to become the ultra-efficient successor of c-Si PV in power\ngeneration, Perovskite and organic\nsolar dyes explore different markets\nand designs altogether.\nHopefully this means, if and\nwhen these technologies become\ncommercialised, they will not have to\ncompete as each will fill a different\nmarket nichem from industry to\ndesign.\nIn the meantime, whilst c-Si reigns\nsupreme, it is difficult to predict\nwhen said commercialisation may\nhappen.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 21\nFELIX 13.02.2015\nWelfare\nfelix.welfare@imperial.ac.uk Welfare Editors Diba Esbati & Chanon Wongsatayanont\nMental illnesses, visualised\nOne of the most enduring issues\nabout mental illnesses is\ngetting people to understand\nthem. Sure, everyone has heard about\nit from the media, but what they\u2019re\nassociated with is far from accurate.\nViolence and mental illness are rarely\ncorrelated, and it only appears that\nway because of the news whenever\nexceptional cases occur.\nIn actual fact, mental illnesses only\naffect the way you look at the world,\nhow it appears and what you feel\nyou should do. It might be dark and\nmeaningless, chaotic and fragile or\nso nonsensical that you can\u2019t seem\nto fit in. It may come in episodes,\ncrippling the sufferer like migraines,\nor it can tint everything they do and\nsee, becoming integrated as a part of\ntheir lives.\nAs this is a matter of perspective,\nmental illnesses are hard to\nunderstand, which makes it seem\nscary and volatile. We, the welfare\nsection editors, have taken a stab\nat explaining what mental illnesses\nare like last term, but for something\nso personal, perhaps art will speak\nlouder than words.\nSo this week, here are some\nwebcomics and illustrations of what\nmental illnesses are like. They aren\u2019t\nhorror stories, more like heartfelt\nattempts to capture the strange\nindescribable feelings that come with\nmental illnesses. Sufferers would feel\nthat they\u2019re understood, and friends\nof sufferers would better understand\nthe people they\u2019re supporting.\nHyperbole and a Half\nStarting off light with perhaps the\nmost popular comic on depression,\nAllie Brosh managed to turn\nher unique humour on her own\nexperience with depression in\n\u2018Adventures in Depression\u2019 or\n\u2018Depression Part Two\u2019.\nIf any of you have read hyperbole\nand a half before, you\u2019d be familiar\nwith the weird and manic way her\nbrain works. She used this very same\nbrain to give a very personal analysis\nof her own depression.\nFunny at times, Brosh vividly\nportrays the escalation of depression,\ncomplete with the sense of\nhopelessness, crippling exhaustion\nand self-hatred. But most uniquely,\nshe showed how an episode of\ndepression can be lifted by the most\nunlikely situations and in the least\nHollywood-like kind of way. This\nreminder can come as a relief to\npeople who thought that depression\nshould be beaten in the most\nconclusive way possible.\nDepression comix\nIn this series of webcomics, the\nauthor known only as Clay gives\na more somber representation\nof depression. Updated weekly,\ndepression comix deals with the daily\nstruggles of depression sufferers and\nthose they care about. The style is\ncompletely in black and white, drawn\nwith heavy lines and a lot of shading.\nWhat strikes me the most about\nthis webcomic is how many scenarios\nit presents. It doesn\u2019t just go into\nthe head of sufferers, it also looks\nat the perspectives of their friends\nand partners across a wide range of\nrelationships, often being awfully\nfrank about how they feel.\nThe honesty makes some of the\nscenarios hit hard, especially when\nit comes to how depression hurts\nthose you love more than it hurts\nyou. These can be cautionary tales\nso sufferers and their friends can be\nmore aware in the future.\nBetter, drawn\nThe name of this series of comics\ncomes from the phrase \u201csometimes\nthings can be said better when they\u2019re\ndrawn\u201d. This is a collection of comics\nby various artists who suffer from\nlong-term mental and physical\nillnesses, including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating\ndisorder and even post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD).\nThe best thing about this collection\nis just the sheer variety from so\nmany perspectives. Some have\npositive outlooks and effective\ncoping mechanisms, others are more\nnegative.\nIt brings home the fact that there\nare a whole lot of people out there\nsuffering from mental illnesses\nand that people cope with them\nin different ways. This sense of\nClay\u2019s depression comix goes for uncomfortably relatable feelings.

It\u2019s hard to comment\nsolely on the music and arguably this\nisn\u2019t what the show\u2019s about. Fashion\nbloggers bitched well into the night\nabout Rihanna\u2019s fucking weird dress\nand Madonna\u2019s arse, so here\u2019s a round\nup of the slightly more musically\nthemed water-cooler moments.\nWhat\u2019s a Beck?\nWho took away the same number\nof Grammys as leader of the free\nworld, Beyonc\u00e9? This guy. Looking\nlike a withered Ed Sheeran, Beck\nwalked off with Best Rock Album and\n(controversially) Album of the Year.\nYou probably know his track \u2018Loser\u2019;\nthe opening sounds a bit like the\nBreaking Bad theme and he moans the\nchorus: \u201cSoy un perdedor/I\u2019m a loser\nbaby/So why don\u2019t you kill me?\u201d He\u2019s\nreleased a ridiculous twelve studio\nalbums since the 90s, collaborated\nwith everyone from Pearl Jam to\nPink and once released a record as\nsheet music only. Seriously.\nDespite sounding like a bit of mug,\nhe looked pretty astonished to be\nup there, and said at an after party\nthat he had expected Beyonc\u00e9 to win.\nMany expressed confusion on Twitter\n\u2013 who was he, where had he come\nfrom and how he managed to triumph\nover Queen Bey, who dropped a\ncritically acclaimed visual album with\nzero notice? The girl who didn\u2019t know\nwho Paul McCartney was must have\nbeen totally flummoxed. Kanye also\nhad opinions on the matter, but we\u2019ll\nget to that.\nOh, Kanye\nIt could have been 2009 all over\nagain. People had pointed out in the\nrehearsals that Kimye were seated\nright by the podium, but Kanye West\nbecame the most tweeted about star\non Sunday night (despite not winning\nanything) by hopping onstage as Beck\n(who? \u2013 see above) waved his Album\nof the Year trophy in poor Bey\u2019s face.\nBut then, oh how we collectively\nsighed in relief as we realised, it\nwas just him playing a little trick!\nHe wasn\u2019t going to go full \u201cI\u2019m-a let\nyou finish but\u2026\u201d at all! Oh Kanye,\nhow you\u2019ve grown. Then just when\nwe thought he\u2019d found his sense of\nhumour after all the incidents of late\n(Barack Obama calling him a jackass\nand that Zane Lowe interview) Yeezy\nruins it all by mouthing off about\nBeck at an after party. \u201cIf they want\nreal artists to keep coming back, they\nneed to stop playing with us,\u201d he said,\nadding, \u201c[Beck] should have given his\naward to Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d Yikes.\nPrince knows what\u2019s up\nIntroducing Album of the Year was\nthe Purple One himself. He\u2019s been\npretty quiet since those surprise\nLondon shows and being on New\nGirl, so this really was exciting.\nIt clearly wasn\u2019t for him though,\nand he mooched onstage looking\nas unimpressed as we all probably\nshould be at an awards ceremony with\nall the pomp and irrelevance to music\nas the Grammys. Any awarding body\nthat gives Best Metal Performance\nto a band it had given Best Comedy\nAlbum to a few years previously,\nprobably doesn\u2019t respect all the\ngenres. Anyway, dressed in a peach\nsuit that some likened to an orange\nprison jumpsuit, he introduced the\ncategory by referencing the recent\nshootings of unarmed black youths\nby police, saying, \u201cLike books and\nblack lives, albums still mater\u201d. Go\nPrince.\nChill out Sia\nGod I love you, Sia, but everyone\nknows what you look like. Having\nonly started to perform facing away\nfrom the audience relatively recently,\npictures of her face do exist on the\ninternet. We get it, it\u2019s more of a\nperformance art thing, and she\u2019s\namazing, having written Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s\n\u2018Pretty Hurts\u2019, Rihanna\u2019s \u2018Diamonds\u2019\nand providing the vocals on Flo\nRida\u2019s \u2018Wild Ones\u2019 that make it\nslightly better than truly awful. She\ndid her usual thing at the Grammys,\nbringing along tiny dancing muse\nMaddie Ziegler and bizarrely, star of\nBridesmaids and SNL regular Kristen\nWiig. Perhaps even weirder than\nWiig\u2019s inclusion was the fact that her\ndancing was totally on point.\nWorld forgives Sam Smith\nLess than a month after Sam Smith\nwas ordered give writing credit to\nTom Petty for \u2018Stay With Me\u2019, due\nto its striking similarities to \u2018Won\u2019t\nback down\u2019 (seriously, have a listen)\nhe bags the Grammy for Record of\nthe Year. Record of the year in terms\nof, record that must\u2019ve been played\nenough times this year to annoy even\nSmith, but presumably not Petty, who\ngot an undisclosed but presumably\nsweet settled-out-of-court sum.\nReminiscent of 2011, aka the year\nof Adele, a Brit took home the most\nawards, including best song, best\npop vocal album and best new artist,\nbeating the loveable Bastille. And\nlike Adele, he thanked the ex who\ninspired it all.\nWho needs a man when you\u2019ve got\nan arm full of Grammys?\nDon\u2019t worry guys, they\u2019re friends now.

And so, I decided\nto talk to the Chairman of the Board,\nDr. Lorraine Craig, to find out more\nabout what the Board does and how\nothers can get involved.\nKamil McClelland: So Lorraine,\ncould you tell me a bit about the\nhistory of the Board and why it\nformed.\nLorraine Craig: The Board was\nestablished in 1955 under the\nsponsorship of the College, the\nStudents\u2019 Union and Old Students\u2019\nAssociations to consider proposals for\nexpeditions submitted by members of\nthe College and to administer funds\ngiven to assist with the cost of those\nexpeditions.\nIt was founded to encourage student\ndevelopment outside of the lecture\ntheatre. During the \u201830s and war\nyears, there were a lot of expeditions\nout of Oxford and Cambridge and\nstarting from around 1953, the\nUniversity of London decided to\nget in on the game, leading to the\nImperial Board being founded.\nThe 1957 Karakorum Expedition\nwas in fact led by legendary British\nmountaineer Eric Shipton, where\nthey surveyed some glaciers in the\nKarakorum alongside climbing,\nalthough the final report was never\nsubmitted.\nThere are also some great photos\nin the archive of an expedition to\nIceland in 1956 where at the start of\nthe trip, they look like best friends but\nby the end are all looking in different\ndirections and seem considerably less\nchummy.\nKM: Do all expeditions have to\nhave a science or research aspect to\nthem?\nLC: This certainly was the case in the\nearly years, where groups went off\nto make a map or survey the geology\nor botany of the area. But I feel this\nhas evolved over the years and I\nwould rather not send out groups\nto do \u2018simple science\u2019 where it is not\nparticularly of any research value.\nNowadays, we are more explicit about\nencouraging personal development,\ngiving people the opportunity to do\nsomething new and exploratory for\nthem.\nI feel it is enough of a challenge and\na learning experience to get the teams\nto thoroughly plan an expedition, go\noff and do it, and then return safely\nafterwards and write up a superb\nreport.\nKM: Why do you encourage the\nstudents to write up a report of the\njourney afterwards?\nLC: I think it is very important for the\nstudents who go on an expedition to\nreflect on their experiences and you\nreally notice as you approach the end\nof a trip that you start thinking about\nwhat you have gained from it.\nLeadership, teamwork,\norganisation, time-management,\ntolerance and compatibility, self-confidence, humility, responsibility\nfor yourself and your team, safety,\ncommunication, project management\nand planning are just some of the\nmany skills that every expedition\nmember has to apply.\nIt is also a matter of legacy and,\njust as you have spoken to and learnt\nfrom people who have gone on\nsimilar expeditions to your own, it is\nimportant to pass on your knowledge\nand wisdom to future explorers.\nIt is all well and good for people\nfrom older years to go on expeditions\nbut you need to help younger\nstudents, those in first and second\nyear, to develop their skills.\nThat is how we all got where we are\ntoday and it is important to give back\nfor that reason.\nKM: And why do you think it is\nthat the Board is not more widely\nknown about?\nLC: Although the College Reporter\nnormally has an article each year,\npast expeditions did not publicise\nthemselves enough. Although it is\nless of a problem now with everyone\ncreating blogs online, people used\nto return from an expedition and,\nas opposed to writing up their\nexperiences, immediately started\nto think about planning another.\nWhilst this is quite a natural thing to\ndo, it has meant that they have not\nalways been available to pass on their\nknowledge as easily and have not\nmade the Board more widely known.\nKM: What is your background and\nhow did you come to be the Chair\nof the Board?\nLC: I am a geologist and have always\nenjoyed the outdoors so soon after\ngaining my PhD from Queen\u2019s\nBelfast, I joined a research group at\nthe University of Cambridge to go\nand work in the Arctic. At the time,\nwomen couldn\u2019t go to the Antarctic\nso I decided to go north instead and\nwas part of a small polar community,\nworking in Greenland, Svalbard and\nEllesmere Island.\nAfter this, I realised how much I had\nbenefitted from the help of others\nand wanted in some way to support\nothers to have a go at expeditions. I\nbecame Head of Research and Higher\nEducation at the Royal Geographical\nSociety and, although this didn\u2019t\nactually involve any research for me,\nI was still travelling a lot of the time.\nJust before I came to Imperial, I\nlearnt that the previous Head of\nthe Exploration Board, Prof. Bob\nSchroter, in fact a close friend of\nmine, was retiring from the role\nand he felt that I would be his\nnatural successor. I then sat in on\na few meetings, the secretary Nigel\nWheatley taught me the job and the\nrest is history!\nKM: Have you found your geology\nknowledge has helped you on\nexpeditions?\nOh absolutely! It gives you a unique\nunderstanding of the landscape, why\nthings are as they are, which helps in\nall aspects of a journey.\nGeology I find also gives you very\nastute observation skills, which is\ninvaluable in every aspect of planning\nan expedition.\nKM: Do you have a favourite\nexpedition in the history of the\nboard?\nLC: I don\u2019t think I could pull out one\nas my favourite as each expedition is\nspecial for the individual members\nwho go on them.\nFor me, I get most enjoyment out of\nwatching the students develop from\nthe first time they approach me with\n\"Established\nin 1955, [the\nfund was]\nfounded to\nencourage\nstudent\ndevelopment\noutside of\nlectures.\"\n\"An article\neach\nyear...past\nexpeditions\ndid not\npublicise\nthemselves\nenough.\"\nThe 2013 expedition took seven Imperial stud\nCould\npay fo\nholida\n\n"

Photo: Richard Davenport\nMax Falkenberg visits the new Orange Tree Theatre show\n\"Birch\u2019s\nmastery of\nemotion is\nspectacular\nand I praise\nthe depths\nof the\ncharacters\nshe offers\nus.\"\n\"Little\nLight is an\nemotionally\ntense\nand well\nthought out\njourney.\"\nThere\u2019s something very familiar\nabout watching siblings argue.\nWhether you\u2019re brother or\nsister, older or younger, at some point\nin your relationship a certain degree\nof sibling rivalry seems inevitable. So,\nfor a change, it was rather refreshing\nto see Little Light open on what felt\nlike a reasonably normal concept: two\nsisters, seeing each other once a year\nto tell little bits about their little lives,\nand occasionally losing it.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Little Light\nstarted as a particularly exciting play.\nSet on the seaside away from the\npeering eyes of neighbours, Alison\nand her husband Teddy live in a\nsomewhat muted, dysfunctional state.\nAn argument about Teddy having\nripped out the stairs to replace them\nwith a ladder dominates the first few\nminutes of the play. There is a clear,\nloving relationship on show, but\nsomething\u2019s missing in their lives.\nTeddy recalls the conversations he\u2019s\nhad with Alison, their trip to Venice,\nand the travesty of Teddy not having\ncooked the lamb for lunch. Alison\ninsists that he\u2019s making most of it up;\nshe\u2019s controlling and particular, but\notherwise unremarkable.\nThe auditorium is intimate and\nquiet. Set in the round, it feels very\nmuch like the dining room the play\nis set in, but there is a distinctly\nunsettling feeling going around. It\u2019s\nall a bit slow to get going, and while\nthat can sometimes be used to a\nshow\u2019s advantage, it does feel a little\ntoo dragged out on this occasion.\nWith the entry of Clarissa, Alison\u2019s\nsister, the play seems to find some\nenergy. Played by Yolanda Kettle,\nthere\u2019s a certain charisma in her\nperformance which draws the\naudience in. Pregnant, and covered\nin mud from running through the\nrain, Clarissa\u2019s arrival sparks Alison\ninto life. Although the casting\nleaves their relationship a little\nunclear, their initial discussion has\nall the hallmarks of a frayed sibling\nrelationship. Anger at having arrived\nearly and furious that Clarissa has\nbrought her uninvited boyfriend,\nAlison\u2019s behaviour becomes\nincreasingly irrational. With an\ninsistence on tradition and complete\ncontrol over her husband and sister,\nthe play finally gives us a clue as to\nwhat\u2019s going on:\n\u201cI wanted to ask you if this year\ncould be different.\u201d\nAlthough it was the first play Alison\nBirch wrote, this is her fourth major\nproduction. With its clear emphasis\non family and tradition, Birch places\na distinct importance on secrets.\nSimon, Clarissa\u2019s boyfriend arrives,\nmany years her senior but with a\ndegree of denial about the difficulties\nof handling family conflict. Alison\u2019s\nfurious, and Simon is clearly unaware\nof the unspoken traditions of this\nyearly meeting. As the play develops,\nhis relationship with his pregnant\nwife and Alison\u2019s need for control\nbuild into a state of extreme tension.\nAlthough little happens for the first\nthree quarters of the play, the power\nbehind the language and the emotion\ngrows spectacularly. What felt a little\ndull to start now leaves you teetering\non a cliff\u2019s edge.\nWith sharp, biting dialogue and\nepic, poetic monologues, the lack\nof understanding on the part of the\naudience seems trivial. We want to\nknow more, we want to hear more but\nmost of all, we want a release of the\ntension. Birch\u2019s mastery of emotion is\nspectacular and I can only praise the\ndepths of the characters she offers us.\nYolanda Kettle and Paul Hickey as\nClarissa and Simon stand out against\nthe performances of Lorna Brown as\nAlison and Paul Rattray as Teddy.\nWhat feels muted and unpleasant in\nAlison never seems to lift and by the\nend, her actions don\u2019t particularly\ninterest us.

Its slow start\nand Alison\u2019s overly monotonous\nbehaviour can be tedious. But in the\ncontext of the madness that unfolds,\nour focus is well held by the tension\nbuilt throughout.\nAs a complete performance,\nBirch can be proud of her script\ntransmission onto stage; perfectly\nsuited to the round and an interesting\ninsight into the vision of artistic\ndirector Paul Miller, Little Light is an\nemotionally tense and well thought\nout journey. Examining the nature\nof family and the pain of losing\nsomeone dear to you, this show\nprovokes thought and even in its\nsadness, leaves an audience satisfied\nat the end.\nLittle Light is on until the 7th\nMarch.\nTickets from \u00a310\n\n"

Said Kaye, \u201cit was an issue I\nbecame very motivated about fixing.\u201d\n\u201cA big part of my manifesto was\nabout engaging women in science so\nit just seemed right to me that basic\nessentials for women should be sold\nat the lowest cost possible.\u201d\nKaye spoke to the Union\nManagement Team who dictate the\nprices in the shop, and determined\nthe financial implications reducing\nthe profit margin may have. The\nmanagement team was amenable to\nthe idea, so long as the student body\nalso supported it, so Kaye took the\npaper to Union Council, which met\nlast Tuesday.\nCouncil passed the paper, although\nnot without debate. One member\ncomplained that if these \u2018essentials\u2019\nare to be sold without a profit margin,\nothers, \u201csuch as water\u201d, should be sold\nwithout a margin too. Kaye told the\nmember that he should then just get\nit out the tap.\nFrom March, the products will be\napproximately a third cheaper.\nFelix spoke to Kaye, who told us\n\u201cthe battle continues - I want there to\nbe more vending machines available\n24 hours a day for students and staff\nalike.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the leaders of\nRussia, Ukraine, France and\nGermany met in Belarus\u2019s\ncapital to discuss bringing peace to\nUkraine after months of violence\nbetween Ukrainians and pro-Russian\nseparatists. The agreed ceasefire\nwill come into full effect on Sunday\nat midnight and will also involve\nwithdrawing heavy weaponry from\nthe frontlines of the conflict.\nAfter the lengthy talks, Russian\npresident Vladimir was the first\nleader to announce the ceasefire,\nadding \u201cThere is also a political\nstatement. The first thing is\nconstitutional reform that should\ntake into consideration the legitimate\nrights of people who live in Donbass.\nThere are also border issues. Finally\nthere are a whole range of economic\nand humanitarian issues.\u201d\nAlthough German chancellor\nAngela Merkel said that the deal\ngave \u201ca glimmer of hope\u201d, she\nacknowledged that all the leaders\nrealise that \u201cthere is very, very\nmuch work still to do.\u201d Angela\nMerkel and the French president\nFrancois Hollande have also asked\nthe European Union to support the\nceasefire.\nThe specifics of the agreement\nwill involve the withdrawal of heavy\nweapons in a two week period,\nbeginning on the 17th\nof February.\nProvisions will also be made to\nprovide amnesty for prisoners\ninvolved with the conflict, and all\nforeign militia will also be removed\nfrom Ukrainian territory. Key to the\nceasefire deal is the agreement that\nall separatist forces will be withdrawn\nfrom the September ceasefire line.\nResidents of Donestsk, a town\nthat has suffered a great number\nof casualties as a result of shelling,\nhave been cautious to greet the\nnews with complete optimism. On\nThursday, some rallied outside the\nrebel government\u2019s headquarters,\ndeclaring \u2018today is a holiday.\u2019\nHowever, some rebels expressed\ntheir disappointment with the new\nagreement. \u2018Sputnik I Progrom\u2019, a\nnationalistic Russian publication,\neven labelled the agreement as a\n\u201cbetrayal of all that th rebels fought\nfor\u201d.\nThe discussions in Minsk appeared\nto be a difficult, tense and drawn out\naffair. During the discussions, Putin\u2019s\napparent frustration at the lack of\nprogress even led him to snap a pencil.\nThe discussions come after\nmany casualties in the region, with\nestimates placing the number of\ndeaths at a figure of over 5,300 people\nsince April 2014. The battle between\nthe Ukrainian forces and the pro-Russian separatists has escalated in\nrecent weeks, with bloodshed rising\nrapidly.\nPerhaps one of the biggest points\nof contention in the ceasefire is how\nKiev will be able to achieve control of\ntheir borders once again, given that\nRussian volunteers and troops have\nallegedly crossed it to provide the\nrebel\u2019s with aid.\nThe border has been difficult to\nsecure, and at present, many of the\nborder crossings are controlled by\nrebels.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 7\nFELIX 13.02.2015\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUnion Council votes in favour of new rent proposals\nStudents present at Union Council\nthis week voted in favour of new\nrent proposals, which included\nlowering the suggested rates for the\nnew student accommodation based\nin Acton.\nThe new hall, now named\nWoodward, will open next academic\nyear; students will face a commute\ntime upwards of thirty minutes to get\nto campus.\nStudents sitting on Council were\nasked to choose between three\ndifferent proposals for future rent\nprices of all student halls, with\none being the rent prices that are\ncurrently in place as suggested by\nCollege.\nAll proposals had to ensure that\nthe average rent for a room across\nall halls is \u00a3166 a week for a 39-week\ncontract, but two out of the three\nreflected a higher price in halls closer\nto campus to average out a lower price\nfor rooms in Woodward.\nCollege had previously suggested\nthat hall prices in Acton would\naverage \u00a3158 a week, but after\ndiscussions between Imperial College\nUnion President Tom Wheeler and\nMuir Sanderson, the Chief Financial\nOfficer of College, it was suggested\nby Imperial College Union that the\ncost be brought down to an average of\naround \u00a3120 instead.\nThis does not include the travel\ncosts students will have to cover to\nget to and from the South Kensington\ncampus.\nHowever, for this average to come\ndown to \u00a3120, other halls nearer to\ncampus would have to see a rent hike\nas a result. This included increasing\nthe average rent of a hall in Eastside\nto \u00a3215 from \u00a3191, and for Southside,\nincreasing it from \u00a3174 to \u00a3200.\nWilson will see a slight decrease from\n\u00a3153 to \u00a3150 a week on average.\nA union spokesperson\nwas keen to\nhighlight that\nthis does mean\nthere will be\nmore affordable\naccommodation\nacross the entire\nportfolio \u2013\nalthough, since the\naverage price of rent\non the whole doesn\u2019t\nchange from \u00a3166,\nit won\u2019t mean that\naccommodation has\ngot any cheaper in\ngeneral.\nWheeler also pointed\nthat these are just\naverages, and there are\nstill major discrepancies\nbetween room prices even within\nthe same hall. Some halls contain up\nto four price brackets, making hall\npricing a complex topic.\nHe also pointed out that there\nis a preference for cheaper\naccommodation in general, but due\nto the nature of South Kensington,\nreducing the prices of halls near\ncampus is difficult.\nDebra Humphris, the Vice Provost\n(Education) was present at the\nmeeting, and was keen to stress the\nCollege\u2019s commitment to \u201cincreasing\ntransparency\u201d when it comes to hall\nprices. Humphris commissioned\nthe Residential Experience Review\nback in 2013, to investigate the\nquality of accommodation, and how\naccommodation can be improved.\nShe also warned however that there\nare no straightforward and easy\nUnion Council condemns Counter-Terrorism Bill\nAlso at Council this week was a\nmotion against the Counter\nTerrorism and Security Bill\n(CTSB), which is currently concluding\nits passage through the Houses of\nParliament.\nThe paper, submitted by Jawaad\nFarooq and seconded by Nida\nMahmud and Shamim Ahmed,\nargues that the bill \u201cdiscourages\nthe free expression and analysis of\nideas.\u201d They note that, were the bill\nto pass, the Union would lose the\nability to control what events it does\nand does not allow to happen on\ncampus \u2013 currently both the Union\nand College can veto speakers at an\nevent before the room is booked.\nCollege Chairman, Baroness Eliza\nManningham-Buller has previously\ncondemned the bill in the House of\nLords.\nConcern was raised over whether\nthe Union is actually able to do\nanything over the bill, as it will\nshortly receive Royal Ascent. When\nthe bill\u2019s provisions become statutory,\nboth College and the Union would\nbe in breach of the law if they chose\nto ignore it. The paper\u2019s supporters,\nhowever, argued that it doesn\u2019t stop\nthe Union from campaigning against\nthe bill.\nThey continued, saying that they\ndidn\u2019t want to remove all measures\nto prevent controversial speakers\nfrom speaking at universities \u2013\nhighlighting the Union\u2019s existing\n\u201crigorous\u201d checking procedures \u2013 the\nfeeling was that banning everyone\nwas not ideal as universities are a\nforum for debate. Tom Wheeler,\nUnion President, said sources in\nCollege felt it was a \u201chostile takeover\nof the university sector by the\ngovernment\u201d.\nThe bill itself is designed to impose\na number of restrictions on people\nor organisations suspected to be\naffiliated with terrorism. The first\npart of the bill allows the Home\nSecretary to remove passports from\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\npeople who have travelled overseas\nto fight for terrorist organisations,\nwhereas the third part forces internet\nservice providers to store data to\nallow the authorities to identify a\nperson by their IP address.\nThe PREVENT strategy, introduced\nin 2003, which will become statutory\nas part of the bill, aims to prevent\nradicalisation of potential terrorists.\nIt is comprised of three sections\naiming to challenge \u201cthe ideology\nthat supports terrorism and those\nwho promote it\u201d, protect \u201cvulnerable\npeople\u201d, and support \u201csectors and\ninstitutions where there are risks\nof radicalisation\u201d. It is in this third\ncategory that universities fall.\nHowever, there have been\ncomplaints about the perceived\ntargeting of Muslims and Muslim\norganisations in projects associated\nwith PREVENT, while others have\ncriticised installation of \u201ccovert\u201d\nCCTV in Muslim communities in\nBirmingham.\nOverall, the paper passed by a\nmargin of 26-3 after a number\nof minor modifications. Despite\nthe recent passing of a policy to\npublically list the voting record of\nCouncil members, Abigail de Bruin\nsupported a move to keep the voting\nrecord as private to reduce the chance\nof members experiencing what she\ncalled a \u201cpersonal attack\u201d as a result of\ntheir vote.\nanswers when it comes to balancing\nrent and hall provisions: \u201cWe can\u2019t\ngive you cheap [rooms] and also give\nyou Eastside.\u201d\nAccording to Wheeler, College\ncurrently has no data that shows\nwhether students would prefer to live\nclose to campus or pay less and live\nfurther away.\nThe Residential Experience Review,\nrun by College at the end of 2013, did\ninvestigate whether students would\nlike to pay less for rent or live closer,\nbut as separate issues. Unsurprisingly,\nstudents answered that they would\nlike to have both options, but there\nwas no way to cast a preference\nbetween the two.\nThe paper covered a number of\ntopics concerning rent prices and hall\nusage. It also included a breakdown of\nrent, showing the costs for cleaning,\nmaintenance, facilities management,\nand wardening.\nIt was also hinted by Humphris\nthat there may one day be halls at\nImperial West too, although it is \u201cstill\nearly days\u201d. Imperial West is the new\ncampus based near White City, which\nis still under development. It will\nhouse new chemistry facilities.\nHumphris stressed that they are\ncommitted to ensuring all first year\nstudents have the opportunity to live\nin halls. \u201cIf we are to achieve our first\nyear guarantee, we need clear plans.\n\u201cIt is still early days but we need to\nre-evaluate our portfolio. There is a\nlarge residential tower [at Imperial\nWest] there, and that could also be\nused for accommodation for our\nstaff.\u201d\nWheeler said to Felix after\nthe meeting: \u201cIt is fantastic that\nas a result of our lobbying and\ncampaigning we have secured lower\nrent for over 1,000 future students\nwith the new approach to College\naccommodation.\n\u201cIt is indicative of the improved\nrelationship that we now have with\nCollege that we are being given these\nfigures, let alone that we are engaging\non these difficult decisions.\u201d\n\u00a30\n\u00a350\n\u00a3100\n\u00a3150\n\u00a3200\n\u00a3250\nBeit Eastside Southside Weeks Pembridge Wilson Woodward\nCurrent Rent Prices\nPrices voted in by Union Council\nAn artist\u2019s impression of Woodward Halls in Acton.
