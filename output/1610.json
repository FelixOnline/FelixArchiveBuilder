    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 28\n16.01.2015\nFELIX\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Light Show Hiding Substance\nPan Pan Theatre\u2019s All That Fall. Photo: Ros Kavanagh\nEmiel de Lange would prefer to be left in the dark\n\"With All\nThat Fall,\nlaughter\nmay be\nthe right\nresponse\nto life\u2019s\nabsurdity\"\nWe enter a dark room\nscattered with rocking\nchairs. The far wall\nis covered by an array of bright\nyellow lights, emanating heat and\nan irritating electrical buzz, while\ndimly lit bulbs hang from the\nceiling. Taking our seats on the\ncushioned wood, I can see the looks\nof anticipation and curiosity on faces\naround me. Like them, I had little\nidea of what to expect, though we\nwere promised to be \u201cimmersed into\nan atmospheric chamber of multiple\nspeakers and ambient lights\u201d whilst\nlistening to Samuel Beckett\u2019s radio\nplay, All That Fall.\nAll That Fall, while obsessed with\nthe mundane and the menial, paints\nour world as a dark and grotesque\nplace. The one-act play follows the\nelderly Maddy Rooney, who makes\nher way along a country road to meet\nher husband at the train station.\nHer journey is tiresome and she\nfeels as if all the world is working\nagainst her. Although friendly\npassers-by offer to help her she still\nmoans, and when she finally reaches\nthe station, the train is late; the cause\nof this delay we don\u2019t discover until\na harrowing climax towards the end.\nThis is a unique moment of suspense\nand emotion in comparison to the\nrest of the play, which feels rather\nordinary. Maddy complains at the\nsmall things in life, she becomes\nannoying and self-righteous, and\nlistening to her I began to tire of life\nmyself.\nThis is a sort of a magic I have\nonly recognised in hindsight: one\nthat allowed me to step into an\nexistentialist perspective on the world\nand see some of its absurdities and\nhollowness. Depressing though it is,\nit\u2019s an invaluable perspective, and in\nfact caused frequent bouts of laughter\nin the room. Laughter may indeed be\nthe right response to life\u2019s absurdity.\nIn this production, the voice acting\nwas superb and evocative. I could\nphysically feel the weariness in\nMaddy\u2019s voice, and the action was\neasily and vividly cast against the\nbackdrop of my eyelids. However,\nmore than reproducing Beckett\u2019s\nmasterful script, the recording \u2013 I\nthink through the timing and\nmixing of ambient sounds \u2013 lent\nthe experience a harsh objectivity. I\nfelt like a spirit floating through the\naction, never feeling at home. There\nwas a sort of tunnel vision: voices\nand noises seemed to appear and\ndisappear unexpectedly and were\nheard abstractly \u2013 their existence\npreceding their essence as the\nexistentialists would say.\nI am less certain about the visual\ncomponents of this production.\nSitting, or rather, rocking in the dark\namong the many others in the room\ndid lend an air of occasion to the\nprocess, but I found the light show\nto be distracting. The orange lamps\nseemed to fade on and off without\nlogic, accompanying the sounds of an\nengine first and then a gust of wind.\nAt one moment they were arranged in\nthe shape of a cross, which I thought\nto be a heavy-handed statement to\nimpose on such a subtle text. This is a\nplay that could be better experienced\nat home, in a dark room, with a good\nset of speakers, but if you do decide\nto go \u2013 make sure you keep your eyes\nclosed.\nThe Peter Pan Theatre\u2019s production of\nAll That Fall is on at the Barbican until\n21st\nJune. Tickets from \u00a318, plus booking\nfee, available online.\n\"This is a\nplay that\ncould be\nbetter\nexperienced\nat home,\nin a dark\nroom\"\nEditorial: A\nFarewell\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nSwan songs.Exits to stage right.\nMagnum opera.The arts world\nis full of goodbyes and farewells.\nPlayers make their entrances\nand their exits; old pros leave the\nstage,making space for those\nnovices waiting in the wings; and\nFelix Artsis no different.This year,\nwe have both had a wonderful\ntime as Arts Editors; throughout\nour tenure we have tried to place\narts content at the centre of the\npaper,and thus\u2013hopefully\u2013at\nthe centre of student life.\nComing to Imperial,one thing\nthat concerned both of us\nwas not the infamous gender\nratio,nor the extortionate cost\nof living in West London,but\ninstead the lack of arts students,\nwhich we feared would lead\nto a university experience that\nwas devoid of life and energy,\nfocussing instead on lab reports,\nexperiments,and days poring\nover textbooks.In some ways,\nImperial surprised us; the lack of\narts students meant that anyone\ncould give culture a go\u2013the\ndrama societies weren\u2019t just run\nby a group of english language\nstudents; the fine arts society\nwasn\u2019t just the habitat of the\nart historians; instead,there\nwas a melting pot of disciplines,\ncollaborating to try and continue\ntheir passion for the arts.\nAt the same time,there were\ndisappointments.A general\nmalaise among the student\nbody\u2013prompted,partly,by the\ndisregard with which Imperial\ntreats its undergraduates\u2013\nmeant that those who were\nconfident about exploring\ntheir passion were few and\nfar between.We have sought\nto rectify that.High points of\nthis year have included the\npublication of the Culture pullout in the 1600th\nissue,and the\nresurrection of Phoenix,the arts\nquarterly,which will be coming\nout as a separate magazine\nnext week.But the real legacy\nwe want to leave behind is\nthe beginnings of an artistic\ncommunity.We will both be\nstepping down next year,making\nway for the next group of editors,\nwho we are sure will continue\nto build on the foundations we\nhave set down.And for those of\nyou who\u2013like us\u2013were worried\nabout finding other students\nwho are interested in opera,in\ndance,in painting,all you need\nto do is open Felix,and check out\nthe bylines in the Arts Section.\nThanks for a fantastic year.\n\n"

Thank you so much to all the\nwriters who\u2019ve sent so many different\nthings in to us, and I hope that many\nof you continue to do so next year.\nI\u2019m never quite sure how many\npeople usually reach this section\nof the newspaper, so, as a recap for\nthose of you who haven\u2019t been paying\nattention for the last 28 issues, I\u2019ve\ncome up with a selection of some of\nthe most memorable stories we\u2019ve\ncovered this year.\nRosetta\u2019s comet rendezvous\nOne of the biggest stories this\nyear was the rendezvous of the\nRosetta orbiter with comet 67P/\nChuryumov\u2013Gerasimenko that\ntook place in November. The Philae\nlander touched down successfully,\ngiving detailed information about the\nsurface and chemical composition of\na comet for the very first time.\nImperial\u2019s involvement was led by\nChris Carr, Principal Investigator\non the orbiter\u2019s magnetometer. In\nan interview with Felix, he explained\nthe difficulties involved in running\nthe project, and some unexpected\nmagnetic field behaviour his team\nhad observed.\nThis was just the start of the\nmission for Rosetta, however, which\nis designed to stay with the comet as\nit approaches the Sun, and analyse the\ngas and dust that comes off it. And\nwith the recent announcement that\nPhilae was now operational again,\nthere remains huge potential for new\ndiscoveries in the near future.\nEbola vaccine researched\nAt the start of the year, we covered\nresearch at Imperial into a vaccine\nfor ebola. At the time, the outbreak\ngrowing rapidly with nearly 6000\ncases already reported.\nThe team recruited 40 volunteers in\nthe Gambia to test the efficacy of the\nvaccine produced by GSK. The trials\nare still continuing with much larger\nnumbers of participants.\nAlthough the number of new cases\nhas declined significantly in recent\nmonths, the outbreak is still going on,\nand has so far reached a total of over\n27,000 cases.\nEcstasy and LSD could be used in\nmedicine\nResearch into the effect of LSD\nand ecstasy (MDMA) on the brain\nhas shown that hallucinogenic drugs\ncould be used to treat psyciatric\nillnesses like depression and PTSD.\nIn October, Imperial\u2019s David Nutt\nand Robin Carhart-Harris carried out\nthe first new trials of LSD on humans\nfor over 40 years, to test its effect on\nsuggestibility.\nNutt\u2019s group has also started\nresearch on a new drug Chaperon,\nwhich is similar to ecstasy and could\nbe seen in future as a way to stop\nbinge drinking.\nWarm oceans under Enceladus\n10 years since Cassini arrived at\nSaturn, the probe is still capable of\nmaking major discoveries.\nIn March, while flying by Saturn\u2019s\nmoon Enceladus, results from its\nmass spectrometer provided us\nwith the first clear evidence that\nhydrothermal activity is occuring\noutside our planet.\nDust particles made of silica\nwere found ranging from 2 to 9\nnanometres, indicating they were\nmade by a specific process that was\nonly previously known to occur in\ncertain regions of the Earth\u2019s oceans.\nThe discovery suggests that warm\noceans exist under the surface\nof Enceladus, which add to the\npossibility of finding environments\ncapable of sustaining life.\n\u2018Three-person babies\u2019 allowed\nA vote in parliament in February\npermitted the creation of babies\ntreated with mitochondrial\nreplacement therapy for the first\ntime.\nIn November, Rosetta became the first probe to reach a comet. Photo: NASA\n\"Warm\noceans were\ndiscovered\non\nEnceladus,\nwhich\ncould be\nable to\nharbour\nlife.\"\n\"David\nNutt\ncarried out\nthe first\nnew trials\nof LSD on\nhumans\nfor over 40\nyears.\"\nThe technique involves replacing\nfaulty mitochondria in a fertilised\negg with those of a healthy donor.\nWhen it is allowed to develop into\na baby, all its cells carry copies of\nthe donor\u2019s mitochondria. It is for\nthis reason that the process has been\nlabelled as creating \u2018three-person\nbabies\u2019\nProfessor of science and society\nRobert Winston was instrumental\nin getting the bill through the House\nof Lords, making an impassioned\nspeech that drew on his experience in\nfertility treatments.\nWhile the vote opens the gate for\nthe technique, further research is\nneeded, and it\u2019s not expected that the\nfirst babies will be born for several\nyears.\nHaving trouble sleeping?\nIn November, we reported on\nnew research into how the body\ncontrols when you wake up and\nfall asleep. The researchers, from\nImperial and Cambridge, deleted a\nwell-known \u2018clock\u2019 gene from mice,\nand discovered that this led to higher\nbrain histamine levels during the day.\nAs a result, the mice had shallower\nand more fragmented sleep patterns.\nSleep research in recent years has\nshown it fulfils a variety of important\nfunctions, including restoration and\nrecovery, metabolic replenishment of\nthe brain and helping to consolidate\nmemories.\nWarm oceans were discovered under Saturn\u2019s moon\nEnceladus.

You\nknow the deal. We heard the\nheadline act once hit a guy.\nCome one, come all (with\nyour ticket obviously) to see\nthe year out with one last on-campus all-nighter.\nThe Last Days of Judas\nIscariot\nTuesday 23rd to Thursday\n25th June 6:30pm, Queen\u2019s\nLawn\nIs play. Come see. Is free. Fun\ntime.\nCORRECTIONS\nWe would like to apologise for\nany confusion caused by the\nusage of the image to illustrate\nthe front cover last week. The\nthe lecture taking place was not\nrelated to the story.\nT\nhis is my final editorial,\nwhich is slightly bittersweet\nto write. It has been a year\nthat has passed incredibly\nquickly overall, but punctuated with\nlong nights, fits and bursts of activity\nand, generally, one that has left me a\nlittle bit tired, to be honest.\nI\u2019ve enjoyed this year as editor of\nthe newspaper immensely: there have\nbeen times where an odd email, angry\nstudent encounter or stressful story\nhas left me a bit down and out, but\noverall, I will look back on my year\nediting this paper fondly.\nI\u2019ve learnt an incredible amount\nabout not just how to run a newspaper\nand put together stories for you all\nto read, but also a lot about leading a\nteam of volunteers to produce a paper\nwe are hopefully pleased about every\nweek.\nWe were shortlisted for Club of the\nYear at the Union Awards this week,\nsomething that made me feel very\nproud of the club I run and the people\nwho make it such a joy to come into\nwork each day. My work colleagues\nare also my friends, and I hope that\nthe people who have ventured down\nto the basement to join in with the\nteam are friends I will carry with me\nafter I (probably) leave Imperial at the\nend of this Summer.\nThis year has been incredibly\neventful in terms of news stories;\nwe\u2019ve ran front-page pieces on\nstudents smashing windows through\nto student surveys, paedophiles\nthrough to sporting mishaps, and\neverything in between.\nIn the office, we\u2019ve drank thousands\nof cans of diet coke, argued over\ncommas, covered the walls in\ncentrefolds, had Chris Kaye pass out\non the floor and we are still yet to take\ndown our Christmas decorations. For\nabout three days we had stick insects,\nbut I think we fed them the wrong\nleaves, and they died. I\u2019ve had a lot of\nfun, and am very aware as I write this\nthat this may be the best job a 23-year\nold avoiding the real world could ever\nhave, not just because I can nap on a\nFriday or watch Netflix and no-one\ntells me off.\nWe hope that we\u2019ve brought news\nto you that has made you more\ninformed about your life whilst at\nImperial, more critical of things that\nare going on around you and started a\ndialogue about some of the big issues\nthat students and staff alike face\nwhilst at this university. It never fails\nto elate me when students come to the\noffice, asking us to investigate stories\nthat they feel need to be shared, and\nseeing the positive results our stories\ncan have on the wider community.\nBut obviously it is not all about the\nnews. We have had some amazing\ncontent this year beyond the red-topped pages at the front of Felix.\nArts as a section has been incredible,\npumping out high quality on a weekly\nbasis, alongside resurrecting and\nrestoring the Phoenix magazine. I am\nso proud of Fred and Kamil, and their\ndedication to the team and the paper\nas a whole.\nIn fact, none of this year could have\neven started without my amazing\neditorial team. All of them have\nput in so many hours of work, and\ncontributed probably hundreds of\npounds to takeaways as we\u2019ve put\ntogether 29 issues throughout the\nyear. I remember the first time I was\nblown away by student dedication;\nit was when we attempted to bring\ntogether the first issue of the term,\nand I was still working at dawn, with\nother students with me.\nSince then it never fails to amaze\nme when others are in the office\nat 3am, when students can write\nhundreds of words on the topics\nthey love and when students will\nspend hours researching and putting\ntogether stories. It\u2019s incredible that\nover 200 students have contributed to\nthis paper this year, all of whom are\nlisted on the back page.\nI am excited to see what Grace will\ndo with Felix next year, and wish her\nthe best of luck. It is an incredibly\nsteep learning curve, and it seems\njust as I was getting the hang of this\nnewspaper lark I\u2019ll need to return\nback to student life and finish my\ndissertation. I will miss the office,\nthe people, the challenges and the\nsatisfaction that comes every Friday\nwhen I see people reading the paper.\nWhich brings us to you, the readers.\nI would love to thank all of you that\nhave picked up a copy on a Friday,\neven if it is just to do the puzzles or\nhave a sneak peak at the centrefold.\nI\u2019ve always said that Felix has a dual\npurpose: for students to have an\nopportunity to make a paper, and\nthen to provide a paper to read.\nI hope you all have enjoyed reading\nour work as much as we did making\nit, and if you want to get involved,\nplease come down the basement\nand pay us a visit next year. We\nare a pretty pleasant bunch; we eat\na lot of chocolate, drink a bit too\nmuch sometimes and on Friday we\nlike to visit Nandos. We are always\nlooking for more to join our rather\ndysfunctional family, so get in touch.\nBuilding up the courage to come\ndown to the office three years ago was\nthe best thing I\u2019ve ever done. I cannot\nrecommend it highly enough.\nFelix would like to thank everyone who has\ncontributed to the publication this year, this paper\nwould not be possible without you!\n\n"

Nominations closed on\nWednesday and Shadow Secretary\nof State for Health Andy Burnham\nis the bookies\u2019 favourite. Burnham\nreceived 68 nominations from MPs\n(the minimum to be on the ballot\nwas 35), Yvette Cooper achieved 59,\nJeremy Corbyn 36 and Liz Kendall 41,\nwith 25 MPs \u2013 including Ed Miliband\nand deputy leader Harriet Harman \u2013\ndeciding not to vote.\nThe veteran Labour MP Jeremy\nCorbyn is the most left-wing of the\ncandidates, while Andy Burnham and\nthe Shadow Home Secretary Yvette\nCooper are seen more as continuation\ncandidates, struggling to distance\nthemselves from one another in a\nfight for the top job in the centre-left\nparty.\nChuka Umunna \u2013 the Shadow\nBusiness secretary who put himself\nas a leadership candidate early on\nand was reportedly backed by the\nformer PM Tony Blair \u2013 withdrew his\nleadership bid and publicly backed\nLiz Kendall. Kendall is seen as a \u201cblue\nLabour\u201d moderniser \u2013 subscribing to\nthe \u201cThird Way\u201d centrist approach\nthat tries to reconcile right and left-wing politics on a populist platform.\nIt has served party leaders well in the\npast, including Blair and the former\nUS President Bill Clinton.\nMary Creagh was unable to secure\nthe support she needed and dropped\nout without nominating any of the\nother candidates.\nLabour\u2019s deputy leadership shortlist\nhas also been finalised: Tom Watson,\nCaroline Flint, Ben Bradshaw, Stella\nCreasy and Angela Eagle will compete\nto replace Harriet Harman.\nFollowing the poor performance of\nthe Liberal Democrats in the general\nelection last May, Nick Clegg stepped\ndown as leader.\nNow only eight Lib Dem MPs\nremain in the House of Commons \u2013\ntwo of which are standing to succeed\nClegg.\nNorman Lamb has been MP for\nNorth Norfolk since 2001 and was\nMinister of State for Care and Support\nfor three years in the coalition. Lamb\nis considered more of the continuity\nleader than his opponent.\nThe second candidate, former\nPresident of the Liberal Democrats\nand MP for Westmorland and\nLonsdale is Tim Farron, who seems\nalmost certain to win the leadership\nbid, given his track record of winning\nbig in his elections and the fact that\nhe is not \u2018tainted\u2019 by involvement in\nthe Conservative-Liberal Democrat\ncoalition government. Tim Farron\nhas gained strong support from\nprominent members of the party\nand is seen as more left-wing than\nNick Clegg, making any possibile\nfuture colaition proposals with the\nConservatives far less likely.\nFarron voted very strongly against\nincreasing the cap on undergraduate\ntuition fees from \u00a33,000 to \u00a39,000,\nand voted in favour of allowing\nmarriage between two people of\nsame sex at the second reading of the\nMarriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.\nHowever, he did not vote for equal\nmarriage on the third reading of\nthe Bill, which he put down to his\nreligious upbringing. Unlike Clegg,\nwho is an agnostic, Farron is a\nchurch-going Anglican.\n2016 Mayor of London candidates\nincumbent Mayor Boris Johnson has\nchosen not to run for re-election for\na third term in office as he is instead\nnow the Conservative Party Member\nCould this muppet be the next leader of the Conservative party? Photo: RothCPA\nof Parliament for Uxbridge and\nSouth Ruislip. He has announced his\nintention to remain Mayor until his\nterm ends in May 2016.\nSeveral party members have\nannounced their candidacy for the\nConservative and Labour parties,\nwith just one official candidate for\nthe Liberal Democrats: the leader of\nthe party in the London Assembly,\nCaroline Pidgeon.\nAnd the controversial broadcaster,\nwriter and former MP for Bradford\nWest George Galloway has thrown his\nhat in the ring as the Respect Party\ncandidate.\nHowever, with the Richmond MP\nZac Goldsmith formally announcing\nhis candidacy for the Conservative\nParty\u2019s bid for Mayor of London,\nthe media have been buzzing and\nGoldsmith \u2013 an Old Etonian who got\nkicked out for smoking cannabis and\nis the former editor of the Ecologist \u2013\nis considered the strongest option for\nthe Tories.\nOther Conservative candidates\ninclude the British businessman and\nthe first and current Deputy Mayor\nfor Policing and Crime in London\nStephen Greenhalgh, and the former\nfootballer Sol Campbell.\nLabour\u2019s candidates are almost all\ncurrent London MPs, but the former\nOlympics Minister and MP for\nDulwich and West Norwood Dame\nTessa Jowell is presently deemed the\nfrontrunner. The former Shadow\nMinister for Public Health and\ncurrent MP for Hackney North and\nStoke Newington Diane Abbott and\nformer Universities Minsiter and MP\nfor Tottenham David Lammy have\nput their names on the ballot sheet,\nwith Tooting MP Sadiq Khan also\nproving popular with Londoners.\nPeople have already started\nspeculating as to whom will succeed\nDavid Cameron as leader of the\nConservative Party after Prime\nMinister David Cameron said he\nwould step down before the 2020\nelection.\nFour MPs are in contention \u2013 three\nof which are currently in cabinet.\nGeorge Osborne, current Chancellor\nof the Exchequer and First Secretary\nof State (making him the de facto\nDeputy Prime Minster), has solid\nsupport from the party and is seen as\nCameron\u2019s natural successor.\nThe Secretary of State for Business,\nInnovation and Skills Sajid Javid\nis also in contention, with growing\nsupport from party activists.\nThe Mayor of London Boris\nJohnson is currently the frontrunner\nto succeed Cameron, as he re-entered\nparliament in May. His widespread\npopularity with the public \u2013 and\nlack of connection with the coalition\ngovernment \u2013 make him strong\nchoice for Conservatives.\nThe Home Secretary Theresa May\nwas at one point a strong contender\nas the only female candidate, but\nin recent months her chances have\nbeen gradually slipping away to\nher competitors. Her leadership\nbid looks less and less credible in a\nfield swarmed with other ambitious\ncabinet ministers.\nNo candidate will have to officially\ndeclare their candidacy until we\nare much closer to 2020, but with\nCameron announcing his resignation\nplans so far in advance, we can rest\nassured that the frontrunners are\nalready plotting to gain the support of\nthe party.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 20\n19.06.2015\nFELIX\nEditor C\u00e9cile Borkhataria\nFashion\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCecile Borkhataria takes a look at the shoe exhibition at the V&A\nShoes: Pleasure and Pain\nThe V&A\u2019s latest fashion\nexhibition takes a look at the\nextremes of footwear from\naround the world, ranging from\nCinderella\u2019s glass slippers featured\nin the recent Disney live action\nmovie, to tiny lotus shoes used to\nbind women\u2019s feet in 19th\ncentury\nChina. The exhibition focuses on\nthe transformative quality of shoes\nand their cultural significance,\nparticularly as a symbol of status.\nWith over 200 shoes on display,\nexamples are shown from famous\nshoe wearers as well as a vast range of\nhistorical shoes dating as far back as\n30 BCE.\nImmediately after walking through\nthe entrance to the exhibition, the\ndimly lit set-up accompanied with\nprovocative music instantly creates\na sensual atmosphere, alluding to\nthe seductive power of certain types\nof shoes. On a projector, a woman is\nshown tying on a pair of red heels\nwith ribbons, walking up a flight\nof stairs and through a hallway in\na fitted dress. Here, the message\nis clear: shoes equal sex. This isn\u2019t\njust my interpretation though; the\nexhibition has an entire section\nentitled Seduction. Footwear, together\nwith feet, have long been fetishised.\nFor women, the shoes most often\nassociated with seduction are, of\ncourse, heels. The appeal of heels\nare numerous. For one, they affect\nthe movement of a woman\u2019s body\nwhilst walking, pushing out the chest\nand behind whilst lengthening the\nleg, all of which are titillating for\nthe opposite sex. \u2018Stripper heels\u2019 are\nplaced on display, and whilst these\nmay just look like normal heels to\nmany of us, with a long thin heel\nand a platform, they were originally\ncreated for a specific purpose.\nStrippers originally wore these heels\nto allow them to grip onto poles, with\nthe platforms providing a firmer\nfooting.\nAnother section of the exhibition\nentitled Status gives an insight into\nthe social significance of shoes across\nthe world. For example, large rosettes\nof gilded or silver lace, appropriately\nnamed \u2018shoe roses\u2019 were used to\nemphasise the nobleman\u2019s legs in the\n17th\ncentury, who would have worn\ntights to emphasise his calves. Shoes\nthat indicate a high social status are\noften impractical in their shape and\ndesign, making a clear statement that\nthe wearer does not have to walk in\ntheir shoes from A to B, but rather\nwould be chauffeured or transported\non a horse drawn carriage, far away\nfrom dirty, muddy streets. For\nexample, \u2018Geta\u2019 shoes were worn\nby high-ranking Japanese geishas,\nknown as \u2018Oiran\u2019, during the feudal\nera (1186-1600). These were sandals\nwith an elevated wooden base to keep\nthe feet dry in rain or snow. The taller\nthe shoe was, the higher the rank of\nthe geisha. The two supporting pieces\nbelow the base board are also made\nof wood and make a clacking sound\nShoes, glorious shoes. Photos: Victoria and Albert Museum\nwhen the wearer walks, signalling the\npresence of a high status geisha.\nSome truly weird and wonderful\nshoes are on display, all telling their\nown story. A pair of 1938 black ankle\nboots designed by Andre Perugia (the\nChristian Louboutin of the time) is\ndraped with flowing Colobus monkey\nfur, conveying the excesses of the\nwealthy at the time. During World\nWar II though, the design of shoes\nwas dictated by a lack of material\nand a sensibility about what was\nappropriate. Such a pair of shoes is\nexhibited, made by a shoemaker in\nKensington using the clients\u2019 old\ncheetah print coat.\nA number of iconic shoes appear\nthroughout the exhibition, including\nSex and the City Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s\nManolo Blahnik Mary Jane heels. For\nthose who are more inclined towards\nsportswear, there\u2019s even a display\nof Brooklyn football boots worn\nby David Beckham when he played\nfor Manchester United. For those\nmore interested in the construction\nprocess, the upper floor showcases\nmethods of shoe creation and\ninnovative new ways of making shoes\nusing 3D printers.\nThe bottom line? There\u2019s something\nfor everyone here.\n\n"

This is starting to feel like a\ntheme for plays around this time \u2013\nnot much information beforehand,\nand a set which gives nothing away.\nDesigner Oliver Townsend has\ncreated a scaffolding monstrosity that\nsits on one wall of the theatre.\nTwo ladders are strapped to the\nsides, with a platform sitting at the\nheight of the balcony. Covering it all:\nwhat look like soup cans, with the\nword \u2018soup\u2019 replaced by \u2018sex\u2019.\nThis is not a subtle visual metaphor.\nThe entrance is covered with a\npicture of an open mouth, blown up\nto ridiculous proportions.\nThis is initially the focal point of\nmost of the audience\u2019s attentions,\nwith an odd hush descending every\ntime the flaps twitch a little.\nEventually, a harsh rumbling fills\nthe room, the sound of subwoofers\nbeing pushed to their limits, and the\nlights start to flicker.\nIt\u2019s starting to sound like the\nbuilding is crashing down around our\nears, and the lights suddenly snap off.\nA nicely dramatic opening.\nUnfortunately, We Want You to\nWatch very quickly squanders this\ndramatic potential.\nIt opens on an interrogation, two\ndetectives quizzing a milkman with a\nfondness for violent porn.\nNo explanation is given, the\naudience are expected to piece the\nscene together on the fly.\nIt soon becomes clear that the\ndetectives believe the man\u2019s porn\naddictions lead to his murdering a\nyoung dental student, using methods\nidentical to those in the videos he\ncan\u2019t stop watching.\nIt\u2019s all a bit weird, but at least the\nmessage is fairly clear. This can\u2019t\nbe said for much of the following\ntheatre.\nThe first scene soon begins to\noutstay its welcome, with the\nattempts at comedy mostly falling\nflat.\nMost of the humour comes from\nthe absurd lines, with the rest being\nsupplied by the synchronicity of the\ndetectives\u2019 movements. Helen Goalen\nand Abbi Greenland (the artistic\ndirectors of RashDash, and the stars\nhere) have clearly rehearsed this to\nperfection, which is to their credit if\nnothing else.\nThe earnestness of their\nperformance, their commitment to\nthis production, is incredible, but\nit just can\u2019t support a script which\nquickly overplays its hand, and fails\nAbbi Greenland, Helena Lymbery and Helen Goalen in We Want You to Watch at the\nNational Theatre. Photo: Richard Davenport\nBut Jack Steadman suggests otherwise (this time, anyway)\nA Rousing Tale of Football and Loyalty\nTo start with, just to avoid\nconfusion \u2013 The Red Lion is in\nand of itself not a humorous\nplay. Certain scenes were found\nparticularly funny by the audience\n\u2013 perhaps partly because laughing\nprevents them from thinking too\ndeeply about the situation, and partly\nbecause those scenes were meant to be\nfunny; but the play itself has a deadly\nserious message.\nThe scenery of the changing room\nof \u2018The Red Lion\u2019, the local football\nclub, is both familiar and arcane,\nand was a brilliant choice to convey\nthe dramatic mood of the play itself.\nFrom the dirty club flag, the worn-down bench, and the hospital-like\nmassage bed in the middle, to the\nsounds of the dripping tap in the\nbathroom, everything found on the\nstage added something of value to the\nexperience.\nThe Red Lion can be viewed in a\nnumber of ways: you can just watch\nit and enjoy it; you can watch it, then\nthink about it and still like it; or\nyou can watch it, apply its message\nto everything surrounding you in\nthis world, and love it. No matter\nwhich method you choose, I still\nrecommend this play. Not because\nit is funny, not because it is about\nfootball, but simply because it has so\nmuch to say.\nThe Sunday league. Your local team.\nYour friends there, or you enemies,\nwho took your position and because\nof whom you started sitting on the\nbench. These things mean something\nto a lot of people. One doesn\u2019t need\nto be a Harvard researcher to claim\nthat a large number of men had a\npart in their life when they dreamed\nof being a football star (or perhaps\nstill dream of this); many of them\nhave played FIFA Manager Mode as\nwell, where \u2013 despite the title \u2013 they\nprobably did not realize what it really\ntakes to be a manager. But it is never\ntoo late \u2013 come along and watch it\nyourself what you need: you do not\nstart off a club that would be able\nto win the Champion\u2019s League next\nyear; the board does not pay you the\nstratospheric salary reported about\nin the media; you need to develop,\nbecause you do not always want to\nbe at the League 3; and probably you\nactually need to make a living. But\nwe also have the other side of the\ncoin: the side of the \u2018old soul\u2019 kitman\n(Peter Wight), who claims his support\nfor The Red Lions, and for the game\nitself; he claims it proudly, unlike the\nmanager; and he claims it constantly,\nunlike the so-called \u2018fans\u2019 and the\nboard who only realize they have a\nclub when it tops the league.\nIn the middle of this contrast, a\npotential star (Calvin Demba) rises\nout of nowhere to become man of\nthe match. The manager (Daniel\nMays) talks about loyalty, but wants\nto sell him to make some money for\nthe club, and himself; the \u2018old soul\u2019\ndoes not talk about loyalty but want\nhim to be loyal, both to himself and\nto the club. Meanwhile the kid just\nwants to play the game, but does he\nCompany SJ: Samuel Beckett in the City\nJingjie Cheng finds that the writer\u2019s work is still powerful to this day\nSometimes, a creative piece comes\nalong that leaves you thinking\nabout its issues for a long time,\nsurfacing now and then as a question,\nemerging here and there as an idea.\nThese works leave an imprint of the\nartist\u2019s thoughts on you, and you are\nleft with a view of the world through\nanother\u2019s eyes. Sometimes, the full\nbrilliance of these ideas does not take\nyou over until you have turned the\nwords over again and again, passed\nthem between your hands, rubbed\nthem between your fingers. They do\nwhat effective art is meant to do \u2013\nmake you ponder.\nSamuel Beckett\u2019s Rough for Theatre\nI and Act Without Words II are two\nsuch works that left me mulling over\nthe issues presented long after the\nshort sketches ended. The double bill,\npart of the ongoing International\nBeckett Season at the Barbican\nCentre, juxtaposes two of the Irish\nplaywright\u2019s miscellaneous sketches\nand runs a common theme through\nthem. Who are the destitute? What\nare their stories? And what can they\ntell us about the nature of human\nrelationships?\nIndeed, the interaction between two\nhomeless people in Rough for Theatre\nI can almost be seen as a microcosm\nof human relationships \u2013 A and B\nhave apparently been left behind in a\nmiserable place, devoid of any other\nhuman being. A is blind while B is\ncrippled, and each can theoretically\nrely on the other to supply what\nthey lack. However, as in many such\ntransactions, there is a mismatch\nbetween what one expects and what\nthe other is willing to give, leading\nto conflict and manipulation. Throw\ninto the mix two very different\npersonalities, and the audience\ncan see how many ways this ideal\ncollaboration can go wrong.\nA, having once seen the light,\nis eager for B to describe to him\neverything about the surroundings,\noften asking if there was light, or\nwhether it was day. B, who can\nsee how hopeless the situation is\naround them, is more cynical, and\ngets increasingly irritated by A\u2019s\nrepeated requests for him to describe.\nHe does not believe that A will help\nhim \u201cunconditionally\u201d, but A does,\nand the two men share an intimate\nmoment together, two forsaken souls\nwith only each other for company.\nThe production is part of Beckett\nin the City, a project by the Dublinbased group Company SJ, which\nspecializes in the works of W. B. Yeats\nand Beckett. The project, which began\nin 2009, transposes the absurdist\nmaster\u2019s works into the architectural\nand social spaces of the city. It has\nalready presented this double bill as\nsite-specific pieces in Ireland, USA,\nand Japan. In each production, the\ncharacters\u2019 relationship with their\nsurroundings is different, but the\nissues are the same.\nWhen the audience arrives for\nthis Barbican production, they are\nled off to an undisclosed location\nin the Barbican Estate, and it is this\nact of navigation that begins the\njourney. By travelling to find the\nleft-behind characters of Rough, we\nare reminded of their isolation. The\nactual city landscape that the play is\nset in, then, becomes part of the play\u2019s\nidentity, and conversely, the scene\nalso irrevocably changes the way we\nview our city.\nIndeed, the beauty of these sketches\nis their versatility in raising different\nissues, depending on where and\nhow it is portrayed. By staging it in\nvarious street corners, Company\nSJ\u2019s director Sarah Jane Scaife draws\nparallels between these men and the\nhomeless in big cities, in the process\ndrawing us closer to their plight.\nAt the same time, by performing\nAct Without Words II after Rough,\nshe sets Act in the context of the\nhomeless. Act is by itself primarily\nan absurdist work, a comment on the\nessential meaninglessness of life as\ntwo characters are goaded into action\nin turn by, well, a goad. They crawl\nout of their bags in turn, going about\ntheir daily tasks which highlight their\ndifferent personalities \u2013 A is messy\nand frail, while B is self-conscious,\nobsessive, and disciplined. At some\npoint in their routine, they carry\nthe bag containing the other person\none step away from the goad, but the\ngoad still reaches them in the next\nround and they repeat the routine \u2013\nan action somewhat reminiscent of\nSisyphus\u2019 task in Hades.\nIn this case, Scaife is perhaps using\nAct to point out the vicious cycle that\nmany homeless folk are trapped in.\nBy putting A and B in bags that look\nlike the sleeping bags of the homeless,\nshe is perhaps commenting on those\nPETER SARVARI\nARTS WRITER\n\"Serious\npoints\nare lost\nbeneath\nabsurd\nscenarios.\"\n\"We Want\nYou to\nWatch very\nquickly\nsquanders\nits\ndramatic\npotential.\"\n\"The\nbeauty\nof these\nsketches\nis their\nversitility\nin raising\ndifferent\nissues\"\nTrevor Knight and Raymond Keane in Company SJ\u2019s Rough for Theatre I.

In this way, while Act was\ninitially rather incomprehensible, the\nmyriad of interpretations and issues\nthat it raises emerges the more one\nmulls over it.\nIt does, however, take some\npatience to sit through Act, especially\nif one is unfamiliar with the idea.\nBeing a mime piece and beginning\nrather slowly, it can be quite\nexasperating if one does not know\nwhat the point is. Despite that,\nRaymond Keane does a very good job\nin portraying a tremor-riddled A and\nBryan Burroughs manages to fully\nembody B\u2019s obsessiveness without\nappearing affected.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nBrendan Brown talks to Joshua Renken about Max Planck,\nthe father of quantum mechanics\nBrandon Brown has spent\nhis career teaching Physics.\nStarting off as physics graduate\nfrom Rice University, Brandon\ngot his PhD from Oregon State\nUniversity and later attained a\ncertificate in Science Communication\nat the University of Califronia,\nSanta Cruz. Now a professor at\nthe University of San Francisco,\nBrandon\u2019s research focus has shifted\nto sensory biophysics and high-temperature superconductivity.\nResearch students at his laboratory\nhave explored the electric and\nmagnetic sensory abilities of a variety\nof creatures.\nHe has written a book about the life\nand work of Max Planck (1858-1947),\nthe German theoretical physicist\nand 1918 Nobel Prize Laureate who\nis considered the father of quantum\ntheory, to be published by Oxford\nUniversity Press in 2015. Brandon\nhas spent most of his career working\nin the field of high-temperature\nsuperconductivity \u2013 an exciting\ntheoretical area of physics that\nheavily relies on the quantum\nprinciples that Planck was first to\npropose.\nI got in touch with Brandon to ask\nhim about his new book and the state\nof science communication around the\nworld.\nJoshua Renken: What is it about\nPlanck\u2019s life and work that drew\nyou to write \u201cMax Planck: Driven\nby Vision, Broken by War?\u201d\nBrandon Brown: I first fell for\nPlanck when I was an undergraduate\nstudent at Rice University in\nHouston. His little photo in our\ntextbook looked unusually sad, and\nI was fascinated to find someone\nmaking a breakthrough in middle age\nversus the canonical age of about 23.\nJR: Can you briefly describe what\nMax Planck is remembered for in\nthe field of Physics?\nBB: He\u2019s primarily known as the\nfather of quantum theory, at the\ntextbook level, for a breakthrough\nhe had in 1900. But I think it\nwould be fair to say he should be\njust as well known for his work in\nthermodynamics and for introducing\nus to so-called natural units. As for\nquantum theory itself, as the book\nsets out, it is not quite right to point\nto a \u201cdiscovery\u201d moment. It\u2019s always\na more rich and complex story than\nthat.\nJR: How important do you think\nit is for scientists to learn about\nthe history and people behind big\nbreakthroughs?\nBB: I think it\u2019s very important, but\nas a professor, I know too well how\ndifficult it is to fit such stories into a\ncurriculum, as we hardly have time to\ngive students access to all the nuts and\nbolts as it stands. More than anything,\nstories about the process should be\ninstructive to students of science.\nWe actually don\u2019t move forward one\nmagical breakthrough moment at a\ntime. It\u2019s a very messy business that\ntextbooks sanitize in order to make a\nsubject more digestible.\nJR: Why do you think it is\nthat of all the great physicists in\nhistory, Einstein has achieved the\nmost legendary status in the minds\nof people today? And how would\nyou say Einstein and Planck differ\nin outlook and scientific approach?\nBB: That\u2019s a huge couple of\nquestions! To me, Einstein absolutely\ndeserves his iconic reputation. One\ncan make very valid arguments that\nhis work merited 4-6 individual\nNobel Prizes, (instead of just one),\nand he really seemed to function at\na different level than his peers, in\nmultiple areas of physics. That said,\nhis reputation and legacy arguably\nbenefitted from two things: (1) his\ntheory of general relativity was\nverified in a dramatic fashion in\n1919 at the dawn of global media,\nto a world starved for positive and\ntranscendent news, and (2) he had\nample time in the English-speaking\nworld, especially versus someone like\nPlanck.\nIn terms of how Planck and\nEinstein differed, I would instead\nwant to emphasize what they had\nin common. They had incredibly\ndifferent personalities but nearly\nidentical scientific motivations and\nphilosophies, in terms of holding\nsacred the existence of universal\ntruths. That was probably the root of\ntheir friendship, in fact.\nJR: Do you think the scientific\ncommunity as a whole does enough\nto educate the public about their\nwork?\nBB: I would say yes. The\ninformation is out there and has been\nout there. Even my humble book\nisn\u2019t turning over many new stones --maybe just a pebble or two, or turning\na German pebble to an English one.\nThe general public only has so much\ninterest in the intricacies of physics.

Voyager 1 is\napproaching Saturn, having\ncompleted a three-year journey\nthat has spanned over a billion\nkilometres. Back on Earth, NASA\nare considering flying past Saturn\u2019s\nlargest moon, Titan, which has\nshown hints of harbouring a thick\nhydrocarbon-rich atmosphere.\nHowever this detour comes at a\nprice: Voyager 1 will be thrown up out\nof the ecliptic (the plane that the Solar\nSystem lies in) and will never reach\nits intended final target of Pluto.\nNASA decides that Titan presents a\nmore scientifically valuable target\nthan Pluto, and after leaving Titan,\nVoyager begins its long and lonely\njourney toward the edge of the solar\nsystem.\nThirty-five years later, the\nquestions that were left unanswered\nabout Pluto following Voyager\u2019s\ndiversion may finally be getting\nanswered. New Horizons, one of\nNASA\u2019s flagship missions, is less than\na month away from the Pluto system.\nLaunched from Cape Canaveral\nin Florida in January 2006, New\nHorizons used a gravitational\nslingshot around Jupiter to accelerate\nit to an Earth-relative velocity of over\n58,000 km/h. At that speed, it could\ncover the distance from London to\nNew York in just under six minutes,\nand could reach the Moon in less than\na day.\nAt the time of writing, New\nHorizons is just over 32 million\nkilometres from Pluto, and is closing\nat a speed of 13km/s. At this speed, its\nencounter will be brief \u2013 beginning\nin the second week of July, there will\nbe a few short days in which to gather\ndata about the planet, its three major\nmoons and the space environment\nbetween them.\nFollowing this, New Horizons\nwill begin the long journey into\ninterstellar space. The hope is that\nthere will be enough hydrazine fuel\nremaining after the flyby to direct\nNew Horizons on to visit a small, icy\nbody known as a Kuiper Belt Object\n(KBO). These are icy fragments,\nmany of which are around 100km\nin size, that inhabit the region of\nthe System out beyond the orbit of\nNeptune. The hope is that analysis\nof a KBO, an object that is effectively\na left-over of the Solar System\u2019s\nformation, will help us understand\nthe dynamics of the process through\nwhich planets formed. If a suitable\nKBO can be found, a flyby will\nhave to occur within the next four\nNatural Killer (NK) cells are\na type of white blood cells\ncritical to the immune\nsystem. They are primarily involved\nin innate immunity the immune\u2019s\nsystem \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d. They\nare now the subject of much research\nbecause they show an extremely\nfast response, starting to act on\ninfected cells within hours following\nan infection. NK cells can target\n\u201cstressed\u201d cells (such as cells infected\nwith virus or cancer cells.\nAs their name implies, they not\nonly target cancer cells but also kill\nthem, by releasing toxins into the\ncells and causing cell death. For these\nreasons, NK cells may prove to be\nuseful in treating cancer. In recent\nyears, there is a new trend in cancer\ntherapy called immunotherapy.\nImmunotherapy is the treatment of\ndisease by enhancing or suppressing\nthe immune system. It has potentially\nless serious side effects than most\nconventional chemotherapy, which\ncan cause changes in the normal\ndevelopment of children with\nleukaemia and reduce the fertility of\nadult patients.\nAs the President of the European\nSociety for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO), Professor Rolf A. Stahel\nsaid in the SMO Symposium on\nImmuno-Oncology 2014, \u201cWe\nexpect that the new possibilities of\nimmunotherapy will substantially\nchange the treatment of cancer. We\nare seeing responses and success\nstories in various areas of oncology,\nto the point that now I think there is\nno doubt in the oncology community\nthat immunotherapy is here to stay.\u201d\nHowever, there is still much\nprogress to be made until\nimmunotherapy can actually\nbe used as a standalone cancer\ntherapy. Although there are many\npossible immune-based approaches\n(dendritic cell based immunity,\nT-cell based immunity), NK cell-based immunotherapy has been\nsaid to be one of the most promising\nimmunotherapies due to the\nintensity with which NK cells attack\ntarget cells.\nUsing NK cells for immunotherapy\npresents some challenges. There\nare two ways in which NK cells can\nbe obtained: donor cells (cells from\nsomeone else) or autologous cells\n(the patient\u2019s own NK cells). Donor\ncells however have the possibility of\nbeing rejected, as happens in organ\ntransplants. Autologous NK cell\nnumbers need to be greatly expanded\nbefore re-infusion but that process\nreduces both their survival and their\nkilling activity. So the main problems\nto overcome are how to make NK cells\nsurvive longer after transfusion back\ninto patients and how to target them\nmore effectively to cancerous cells.\nSome researchers at Imperial focus\non manipulating the E4bp4 protein\nwhich is critical in the production\nof NK cells from blood stem cells.\n\u201cWe are hoping to make it easier to\nproduce large numbers of human NK\ncells from umbilical cord blood stem\ncells and that these NK cells will have\nimproved survival and also be very\ntoxic to cancer cells when transfused\ninto patients\u201d, said Dr Hugh Brady,\nDepartment of Life Sciences. Dr\nBrady\u2019s group discovered that the\npresence of E4bp4 is the switch that\nmakes blood stem cells turn into\nNEFELI MARIA SKOUFOU\nPAPUTSAKI\nSCIENCE WRITER\nto five years, after which point the\nplutonium power source that powers\nthe spacecraft will have weakened to\nthe extent that instruments no longer\nwork at peak capacity.\nThe end of the mission is scheduled\nfor 2026, though if the spacecraft\nremains in good working order it may\nbe extended. Some twenty years in\nthe future, New Horizons will likely\njoin Pioneers 10 and 11 and Voyagers\n1 and 2 in being the only man-made\nobjects ever to leave our Solar System.\nBecause there is nothing in space\nto slow it down, it will continue out\ninto the galaxy long after all the\ninstruments have fallen silent.\nThere are hopes that before the\nantenna shuts down, NASA will beam\na \u2018Record of Earth\u2019, similar to the\ngolden disks carried on the Voyagers,\nto the spacecraft to be stored in its\ncomputers. The idea is that should\nanyone out there ever happen across\nNew Horizons, they will be able to\ntell where it came from and what it\nwas doing. Perhaps in a few hundred\nthousand years it will end up sitting\nin some alien\u2019s version of the Science\nMuseum.\nNK cells and that by increasing the\nlevels of E4bp4 many more NK cells\nare produced. Even increasing the\nnumbers of NK cells in a patient may\nhave therapeutic effects. A 11-year\nlong study from Japan, published\nin the Lancet showed that people\nwith lower numbers of NK cells\nhave higher incidence of cancer,\nNatural Killer cells (in red) are a potential form of immunotherapy.\nImage: Geoffrey Williams/Daviel M. Davis\nwhich suggests that having more NK\ncells may have a prophylactic effect\nagainst cancer.\nHopefully, the researchers at\nImperial and elsewhere in the world\nwill solve these problems soon so\nthat NK immunotherapy can realise\nits promise in the clinic as a potent\nweapon against cancer.\n\n"

The newspapers\nwere right. There was a whitewash.\nBut it wasn\u2019t England that were\nvictorious.\nEighteen months on, and everyone\nin England is a lot more circumspect\nabout what to expect this summer.\nGone are the days where England\nwere considered the better side. This\ntime round, the question I\u2019ve heard\nis not \u201cWho will win the Ashes\u201d, but\n\u201cHow much will Australia win by\u201d.\nTo be honest, I\u2019m also really tempted\nto answer that question rather than\nthe former. In fact I will.\nAustralia have soared to new\nheights since delivering the Ashes\nthrashing, beating India and\nthumping the West Indies. They\u2019ve\nalso added another World Cup to\ntheir trophy cabinet and look near\nunbeatable. Especially over five tests.\nTheir batting is formidable. Even\nif Chris Rogers does not recover\nfrom concussion, the opening pair\nof Shaun Marsh and David Warner\nare both reliable and potentially\nexplosive. The middle order of Steve\nSmith and Michael Clarke can take\nthe game away, and Adam Voges\nis making the most of his belated\nintroduction into test cricket. And\nonce you\u2019ve got through them there\u2019s\nstill Shane Watson and Brad Haddin\nto get through.\nAustralia\u2019s bowling is something\nto be admired. It says it all that we\nare looking at a bowling line up that\nMitchell Johnson, the man behind\nEngland\u2019s destruction, might not\neven get a look in. Ryan Harris and\nMitchell Starc have the potential to\nrun through any batting order with\nthe new ball. And Josh Hazlewood\nand the in-form Nathan Lyon will\nbe on hand to clean up the rest, with\nthe assistance of the useful Shane\nWatson.\nBut it\u2019s not the team that will win\nAustralia the Ashes. In my opinion,\nit\u2019s their style of play that\u2019ll be\nthe death of England\u2019s Summer.\nAustralia\u2019s brand of cricket is\nincredibly aggressive. How many\ncaptains in the world would declare\nlike Clarke did last week, setting only\n390 to win, and that too with more\nthan two days left in the match?\nIn my mind there\u2019s only one other\nCaptain in the world who would\nconsider that, and it\u2019s to England\u2019s\nadvantage that they\u2019ve played the\nfirst half of the summer playing\nagainst his side.\nBrendon McCullum\u2019s New Zealand\nshowed this Summer at Headingley\nhow attacking cricket can take a game\naway from the opposition in a matter\nof hours. McCullum played the game\nas if the rain was going to rob his side\nof a hundred overs to bowl England\nout twice, and he reaped the rewards.\nHowever, that also showed in the\nfirst test match of the series that\nthe attacking ploy is not foolproof,\nand this is where England will get\nchances this Summer. It\u2019s because\nof the way the attacking style can\nbackfire that I predict that England\nwill comfortably stave off the threat\nof a whitewash. But make no mistake\nabout it \u2013 this is Australia\u2019s Ashes to\nlose, and when have they ever given\nup that chance?\nKunal\u2019s prediction: A 3-1 win for\nAustralia. I reckon England will be\nable to sneak one of the later tests as\nAustralia\u2019s luck will run out. And it\nwouldn\u2019t be an English summer if we\ndon\u2019t lose a test match to the weather\nwould it?\nFelix Sport takes a look at the key questions that will be answered during the summer\nEngland celebrate at Trent Bridge in 2013. But will they win this time? Photo: Yahoo\nHow realistic are England\u2019s\nchances?\nWith the Ashes looming Kunal Wagle says he will\nhoping but not expecting\nHappy Halloween for\nEngland?\nJonny Pratt gives his views on this\nSeptember\u2019s rugby extravaganza\nThere\u2019s now a bit fewer than 100\ndays to go until the kick-off of\nthe 2015 Rugby World Cup,\nwhich England (and the Millennium\nStadium) is hosting. Three of the\nseven Rugby World Cups to date\nhave been won by the host nation (or\none of the host nations in the case\nof multiple hosts), and in two of the\nothers the host has been the losing\nfinalist. As such, there is a huge\namount of pressure on England to\ndeliver this Autumn. However, this\nEngland side still feels like a work in\nprogress, and coming runners up in\nfour consecutive Six Nations is not\nquite the position they\u2019d like to be in.\nEngland have been drawn in a\ntough group, with a victory needed\nover at least one of Australia or\nWales. While England have a strong\nrecord against Australia in recent\nyears, and a couple of victories in\nthe last two games against Wales,\nthese are both teams that can really\ncause England problems if their\ngame clicks. Look no further than\nthe now infamous 30-3 loss to Wales\nin Cardiff a few years ago. That said,\nat Twickenham you would have to\nback England in both of these games.\nThere is also a potentially tricky\nopening match against Fiji, who are\nalways keen to cause an upset at the\nWorld Cup. While \u201cinternational\nfriendlies\u201d don\u2019t exist in rugby, the\n62-5 victory against essentially a\nreserve Wales team in 2007 shows\nthat these aren\u2019t necessarily played at\nfull pace, England will have to make\nsure they\u2019re battle ready from the\nget-go. This tournament there has\nalso been a concerted effort to make\nthe scheduling fairer on the smaller\nnations, with some expected to play\nafter only three or four days rest in\nNew Zealand in 2011, so expect to see\na few more shocks.\nTop this group though, and a\nhardened England team will (likely)\nhave a relatively favourable route\nto the final. If the other groups end\nas the formbook suggests, England\nwould avoid any of the Southern\nHemisphere teams until the final.\nWhile you have to be prepared to\nbeat any team to win the World\nCup, sticking with the teams which\nEngland should be more comfortable\nplaying could massively help.\nAvoiding New Zealand is always a\nbonus, as having only lost two games\nsince the last tournament they go\nin as clear favourites to retain the\nWilliam Webb Ellis Cup. So, can\nEngland win the World Cup? Yes,\nbut I don\u2019t think they will. England\ncan beat any team in a one-off game,\nbut I just think this team isn\u2019t ready\nyet. I hope to be proved wrong but\nI\u2019m predicting a narrow semi-final or\nfinal loss.\nWhatever happens in this\ntournament, I hope that we get to\nsee rugby at its best. It\u2019s a massive\nopportunity for rugby to grow in\nthis country and, much like Jonny\nWilkinson in 2003, the opportunity\nfor new heroes to be made. Whether\nStuart Lancaster gets on the\nChristmas Honours list, or South\nAfrica steamroll everyone in their\npath, I hope we get to look back on\nthe tournament and be proud. Even\nif it\u2019s Wales going up the steps to\nthe Royal Box on the 31st\nof October,\nwhich would be a frankly terrifying\nHalloween.\nWe are fast approaching\nthe best fortnight of\nthe British sporting\nSummer. Although, having said\nthat, Wimbledon\u2019s status as Britain\u2019s\nbiggest event of the Summer is under\nserious threat from the Ashes and\nthe Rugby World Cup. However\nnothing, at least in my mind, can beat\nthe traditions of the tournament in\nSW19.\nAndy Murray has made a much\nimproved start to the season, reaching\nthe final of the Australian Open,\nbefore losing out in a marathon\nmatch against Novak Djokovic in the\nsemifinals at Roland Garros. He also\nhad a very strong season on the clay\ncourts in general, including beating\nKing of Clay Rafael Nadal for the first\ntime in Madrid.\nBut the grass court season will\npresent a very different kind of\nchallenge for Murray. It\u2019s this time of\nyear that Roger Federer comes into\nhis own, and I for one would not be\nsurprised if he puts a really good run\nin South-West London this summer.\nThere\u2019s also Nadal, who proved\nlast week that he can still keep in\ntouch with those above him, despite\na disastrous clay season and crashing\nout at the Queen\u2019s Club this week.\nHe\u2019ll be itching to provide a good\nperformance to show the world that\nhis career hasn\u2019t stagnated.\nThere are the \u201cperipheral\u201d players\nas well. One person we always seem\nto be talking about when it comes to\nWimbledon is Grigor Dimitrov, or as\nyou may have heard him for the last\nfew years, the next Roger Federer.\nDimitrov beat defending champion\nMurray in last year\u2019s edition, and he\nwould probably be a good outside\nbet for surprise winner of this\ntournament.\nAnother player who has recently\nthrown the cat among the pigeons is\nSwiss Stanislas Wawrinka.\nWawrinka, who has now won two\ngrand slam titles (after his shock\nvictory over Djokovic in Paris a\nfortnight ago), will feel that he is well\nplaced to add to his collection, despite\nbeing defeated in the second round in\nBarons Court.\nSince shocking Rafael Nadal in\nthe early stages of last year\u2019s edition,\nAustralian Nick Kyrgios has gone\nfrom strength to strength. He\u2019ll be\nhoping to spring a few surprises\nas he aims to bolster his already\nburgeoning reputation.\nAnd of course, there is the world\nnumber one Novak Djokovic. The\nDjoker will be feeling wounded after\nnot winning a seemingly inevitable\nfirst French Open title. There is no\nbetter way to get past that shock than\nto win the greatest tournament of\nthem all.\nPrediction: It\u2019s going to be tough\nfor Murray this Summer, and I don\u2019t\nthink he\u2019ll manage it. I feel that he\u2019ll\nreach the semifinals before losing to\nDjokovic. And I think it\u2019s inevitable\nthat Djokovic will win the title. I do\nthink that there will be a surprise for\nthe other finalist. Either Dimitrov or\na rematch with Stan Wawrinka would\nnot be unexpected.\nWill Andy Murray win Wimbledon?\nKunal Wagle fears that Novak Djokovic might just be too good\nAndy Murray hasn\u2019t won a grand slam since his Wimbledon triumph in 2013 Photo: Getty Images\nDriving Lessons\nFor Imperial Students\n5\nLessons\nonly\n\u00a395\nA special offer for Imperial Students from Denis Smyth\n\u2022 Driving Standards Agency (DSA) Accredited Instructor\n\u2022 Mock Test Examiner\n\u201cHaving always been apprehensive about learning to drive, especially in London - learning\nwith Denis gave me the confidence and skill to pass my driving test first time round.\u201d\nLlywellyn Edwards, Royal College of Music Student.\nTo make inquiries or book lessons, call 07808 610 898\n\u201cDennis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from completely inexperienced and\nutterly hopeless driving up to the standard to pass their test.

In fact, London is one\nof the most visited cities of all times\nand there\u2019s probably a thousand\npeople out there who would swap\nplaces with you in a heartbeat.\nBut what is there to do? Some of\nyou might whine: I have already\nspent the last year(s) in this place and\nexplored everything I could. If you\nare actually asking this, then you\nreally don\u2019t understand the magic\nof summer. Summer is a time for\nrooftop cinemas, parks, markets\nand pop ups \u2013 and in order to truly\nconvince you, I have compiled a list\nof the best of the best to look out for:\nRooftop cinema\nA surprisingingly large number of\npop up cinemas surface during the\nsummer months, and among them\nrooftop cinemas are the most magical\nkind. With a big silver screen, a\nscatter of deck chairs or bean bags,\nLondon evening sky viewed at several\nstorey high slowly darkening. It\u2019s a\nmovie experience like no others.\nYou can catch a rooftop movie at\nShoreditch with the Golden Bee\nCinema, or across various venues\nwith Press Play or Roof Top Film\nClub. Movies range from cult\nphenomenon like Fight Club to\nrecent hits like The Grand Budapest\nHotel and tickets usually ballpark\naround \u00a315.\nAlternatively, you can watch movies\nwith non-rooftop pop up cinemas\nsuch as The Big Cinema Club for as\nlittle as \u00a35 with drinks and popcorn.\nThe Parks of London\nWhile London is known as a\nmetropolis, its Royal Parks actually\ncover a whopping 1978 hectares\nof ground. Made up of 8 parks, the\nreason why they are called Royal\nis because they used to be hunting\ngrounds of the royal family but are\nnow open to the public. It is worth\nnoting that Kensington Gardens,\nHyde Park, Green Park and St James\nPart form an almost unbroken\nstretch of green space together and\nRegents Park is only a few blocks\nnorth of the northeast tip of Hyde\nPark. Most of you have probably\nbeen to a few on the list, so why not\ncomplete the set during Summer?\nGreen Park\nWith only 16 hectare of ground,\nGreen Park is the smallest of the\nRoyal Parks. It lies between Hyde\nPark and St James Park and does not\noffer much in terms of attractions.\nIt sits beside the busy transport\nstation of the same name and border\nBuckingham Palace on its south with\nthe A4 running across it on one side.\nSt James Park\nStretching all the way along with the\nMall, this beautiful park covers 23\nhectares with a small lake called St\nJames\u2019s Park Lake. The blue bridge\nspanning across the lake offers an\nexcellent view of the Buckingham\nPalace and Westminster. This\nis by far the most central park\nwith Horse Guards parade and 10\nDowning Street at the other end, and\nTrafalgar\u2019s Square just a stone throw\naway.\nHyde Park\nThe largest park in Central London,\nthough only fourth largest in the\nRoyal Parks, it covers 142 hectares\nwest of Green Park. It is divided in\ntwo by its lake, the Serpetine and\nthe Long Water and the former is\nan excellent boating place in the\nsummer. It is famous for its Speaker\u2019s\nCorner on the northeast corner\nwhere any lawful public speaking can\nbe conducted, as well as the Diana,\nPrincess of Wales memorial and the\nHolocaust memorial, both near the\nSerpentine.\nKensington Gardens\nOften confused as part of Hyde\nPark, the Kensington Garden is on\nthe otherside of the West Carriage\nDrive and is locked at night. It\ncovers 111 hectares, and is home to\nthe Serpentine Gallery, the Albert\nMemorial, the Round Pond, Italian\nGardens, Kensington Palace and the\nDiana Memorial Playground.\nRegents Park\nNorth of Baker street and spanning\nover 166 hectares, the beautiful\nRegents Park containing Regent\u2019s\nUniversity London and the London\nZoo. This open parkland has a wide\nrange of garden, a personal favourite\nbeing their rose garden, a picturesque\nlake, many sports ground and even an\nopen air theatre.\nIt is also dotted with villas with an\ninner and outer ring road that take\nyou around all the main attractions.\nBushy Park\nWith 445 hectares, Bushy Park is the\nsecond largest of Royal Parks and\nimmediately north of the Hampton\nCourt Palace. It is a Site of Special\nScientific Interest, with abundant\nwildlife and fishing ponds.\nRichmond Park\nThe largest of all royal parks,\nRichmond Park boast 955 hectares\nand was created by Charles I in the\n17th\nCentury as a deer park.\nIt is a national nature reserve and\nincludes many building of historic\ninterest such as the White Lodge (a\nformer royal residence). The best way\nto get around the park is by cycling.\nGreenwich Park\nA former hunting ground turns green\nspace, Greenwich park is part of\nGreenwich\u2019s World Heritage side and\nLondon is one of the top destination in the world. With culture, history, beautiful parks and famous nightlife, there\u2019s plenty to do in the capital.\nPhoto: Yung Nam Cheah\n\"The\nmagic of\nsummer...a\ntime for\nrooftop\ncinemas,\nmarkets....\"\nLooking over at the Buckingham Palace from the blue bridge of St James\u2019 Park. Photo: Yung Nam Cheah\n\u201cGreenwich\nPark\noffers a\nspectacular\nview\ntowards\nCanary\nWharf.\u201d\ncover 74 hectares.\nIt offers a spectacular view towards\nCanary Wharf from its hills, its main\nattraction is the Royal Observatory\nwhere you can walk across the\nGreenwich Meridian.\nMarkets, Markets and\nmore markets\nLondon has no shortage of markets,\nand if I were to list them all we would\nprobably end up being here all day. So\nI will only present a small selection of\nmy absolutely favourite here:\nPortobello Market\nMade famous by the movie Notting\nHill, Portobello on a Saturday is the\nplace to be. Mostly focus on antiques\nand vintages, it\u2019s worth bearing in\nmind that while the South end is\nmore picturesque, the less tourist\ncatered part is towards the Ladbroke\nGroove Underground Station. There\nare also no shortage of food vendors\nand quirky restaurants in the area for\nthose who don\u2019t want to stand and\neat.\nBest time to go: Saturday 9:00 \u2013 19:00\nNearest stations: Ladbrooke Grove, and\nNotting Hill Underground\nBrick Lane\nLined with Indian restaurants and\nfabric shops, the true Brick Lane\nSunday Upmarket does not start until\nnear the Truman Brewery.\nFeaturing a scattering of smaller\nmarkets, you have not one, not two,\nbut three food areas bursting with\ninternational cuisines waiting for you\nto sample.\nAfter you have satisfied your\nhunger, there is a maze of vintage\nshops and antique vendors around\nthe area for you to browse, not to\nmention the street stores lining the\nmain road.\nThe area is also home to famous\nvintage shops such as Beyond Retro\nwhilst Spitalfield markets is only a\nstone throw away.\nBest time to go: Sunday 9:00 \u2013 17:00\nNearest station: Best to walk there from\nLiverpool Street (10 minutes)\nColumbia Road Flower Market\nA ten minutes\u2019 walk from Brick Lane,\nColumbia Road Flower Market now\nattracts an international crowd. From\npeonies to carnations, you can find\nall sorts of flowers and potted plants\nselling in this market.\nDespite the positively cloistering\ncrowd, it might be worth going at the\nend of the day so you can grab some\ncheap flowers to brighten up your\nsummer.\nOpening times: 8:00 \u2013 3:00 (ish)\nAddress: Columbia Road, London, E2\n7RG\nCamden Lock Market\nHaving expanded in recent years,\nthis historical market originated as a\nstable market.\nOpen every day of the week \u2013\nthere are a plethora of food vendors\nand charming artist selling their\ncuisine and crafts. In addition to\nthat are some fine book stores on\nthe underground level and of course,\nvintage shops.\nNot to be missed is the futuristic\nCyberdog store, photographic\nopportunity with the horse statues\nand the beautiful raised terrace of\nNothing beats a magical sunset at Kensington Garden by the round pond.

While\nnot exactly the cheapest around\nthe world, there\u2019s no question that\nLondon pop up scene has one of the\nwildest imaginations. I would try to\ncover some, but I know I won\u2019t even\nget close.\nImmersive Theaters London\nThe kind of pop up that send your\nheart into a wild frenzy, immersive\ntheatres are the new way to\nexperience the world of theatrics.\nAllowing you to take part in the\ndrama itself, you get to be chased\nby the bad guy and make deals with\nthe heroines, or if you fancy, get\nchased by zombies. London is home\nto several so I would pull up a list,\nbear in mind that these are not the\ncheapest indulgent.\nLists: www.20bedfordway.com/news/\nimmersive-theatre-london\nThe Nantucket Beach Club\nRooftop Pop-up Bars\nNantucket is a little known island\nin Massachusetts and this summer\nHilton Hotel Tower Hill is bringing\nthe charm of the East Coast to the\nLondon rooftop.

Pete Brook,\nICTV\u2019s Station Manager, said \u201cSo\nmany people have put in so many\nhours to make ICTV what it is this\nyear. Live show producers, directors\nfor our shorts and all the tech people\nwho\u2019ve made stuff work. We are really\ngrateful to all the people in the club\nand the union for all their support\nand hard work!\u201d\nMechanical Engineering Academic\nRepresentative Rory O\u2019Keeffe won\nthe Academic Rep of the Year award.\nSpeaking to Felix afterwards, O\u2019Keeffe\nsaid \u201cHaving been part of the rep\nsystem for the last three years, it is\ngreat to know the work I have done\nhas been appreciated. I would like to\ngive a special mention to my team\nof Year Reps from the Mechanical\nEngineering Department, who have\nbeen a massive help throughout the\nyear, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have done it\nwithout their support, and for that I\nwould like to thank them.\u201d\nThe Postgraduate Academic\nRep Team of the Year Award was\npresented to the Graduate Student\nUnion\u2019s Academic and Welfare\nteam. A member of the GSU rep\nteam, Mike Asavarut, said \u201cThis\naward represents the partnership\nthat the GSU Academic and Welfare\nOfficers have with the union, college\nand especially the Graduate School.\nMaking representation effective is a\ndaunting task, given the unique needs\nthat each department and faculty\nhave. One size does not fit all, and\nthe GSU representation team have\ncertainly given their best to represent\nthe postgraduate student body at all\nlevels.\u201d\nThe undergraduate equivalent was\ngiven to the Physics department\u2019s\nrep team, who have now won\nthree times in the last five years.\nThey said about their award \u201cThe\nUndergraduate Academic rep team\nfor Physics is immensely pleased\nthat the Union has again decided to\nrecognise their dedication to strong\nstudent representation within the\ndepartment. This is the third year in\nthe past five that the Physics rep team\nhas been given this award, which\nreflects the culture of strong student\nengagement in the undergraduate\nexperience that is present in the\nstudent body of the department. We\nare all very pleased that the students\nrecognise the effort that we put into\nensuring that their voices are heard\nby the department on the issues that\naffect them.\u201d\nOther awards included the\ncampaign of the year award, which\nwas presented to Mentality, who ran\na survey last month that found that\nthree in four Imperial students suffer\nfrom stress or a mental condition.\nSpeaking after receiving their award\nfor the club of the year, the Islamic\nsociety said \u201cMuslim students are one\nof the most active students on campus\n(sic).

Since Imperial is\nan all-science university, it can be\ndifficult for people to engage with\nother projects, such as writing or\nculture and Felix has provided that\noutlet in an inviting atmosphere.\nThey have also successfully covered\na number of high profile issues that\ndirectly impact the student body.\n\u201cOverall it\u2019s been an incredible year\nfor the Union and I\u2019m so thankful\nand proud of all of the students that\nhave poured so much time and effort\ninto making the Union so amazing.\nWe really wouldn\u2019t be what we are\nwithout you guys!\u201d\nThe Union Awards ceremony was held on Monday evening.

So while you spent\nthe year locked in labs, cramming\nor pretending to do your FYP, you\nmight have missed the following.\nThe Feminist Moment\nWhile the movie industry offered\nPatricia Arquette\u2019s speech at the\nOscars to put the subject of equal pay\nin the spotlight, Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s interview\nwith Pitchfork did something\nsimilar within music. The Icelandic\nsinger-songwriter drew attention\nto the subject of rightful crediting\nand the way she\u2019s seen this handled\ndifferently between male and female\nartists. Whilst discussing her album,\nVulnicura, she remarked that multiple\nsources had incorrectly reported that\nher co-producer, Alejandro Ghersi,\nhad been completely behind the beats\non the record. \u201cIf whatever I\u2019m saying\nto you now helps women,\u201d she told\nPitchfork, \u201cthen I\u2019m up for doing it,\u201d\nbefore pointing out that no one would\never accuse Kanye West of not being\nthe master of his own sound, despite\nundoubtably bringing in outside\nhelp. Perhaps applicable in a wide\nrange of industries were Bjork\u2019s views\non the way society treats opinions\ndependent on the gender of the\nsource. \u201cEverything a guys says once,\nyou have to say five times\u201d.\nThe Moment that broke a\nmillion hearts\nDespite not having mentioned One\nDirection in this section all year, we\nat Felix Music appreciate that they are\nthe biggest band on the planet, and\nloss of quiet dreamboat Zayn has to\nbe included in a round up of the year\u2019s\nevents. Regardless of your personal\nopinions on the band\u2019s output, or love\nlives, this was the Geri leaving Spice\nGirls, or Robbie leaving Take That,\nof a generation. And in terms of fan\nfallout, it was phenomenal. Since\nthere was no Twitter when Ginger\nSpice hung up her Union Jack dress,\nthis was the first time a quick hashtag\nsearch (Zaynwillalwaysbeapartof1D)\ncould reveal the reaction of a\nwhole army of young fans. Will the\ninstitution survive? Will Harry go\nnext? Will the entertaining Twitter\nspats continue? Only time will\ntell.\nMomentary Dickhead\nWhat an end of year list be without a\nKanye West-ism? Especially coming\nfrom Kanye himself. Almost in\nhomage to his 2009 stage invasion of\nTaylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech for\nbest female video at the Video Music\nAwards in 2009, Kanye leapt onstage\nwhen Beck accepted his Grammy for\nalbum of the year.\nAfterwards, Kanye told Ryan\nSeacrest it was a joke and that \u201cthe\nvoices in my head told me to go\u201d, but\nconfusingly, later said that Beck\u2019s\nwin over Beyonc\u00e9 was \u201cdisrespectful\nto inspiration\u201d. As a third and\nfinal turnaround, Kanye tweeted\nan apology to the singer, having\nadmitted he hadn\u2019t listened to the\nwinning album when he made the\noriginal comments. Apparently\ntaking the chance to get stuff off his\nchest, Kanye subsequently tweeted\nan apology to Bruno Mars who\nhe\u2019d previously \u201chated on\u201d but now\n\u201crespects what he does as an artist\u201d.\nKanye, are you okay, hun?\nThe Trailblazer Moment\nWe\u2019re cheekily including SIA,\nbecause although she\u2019s been around\nfor ages, and \u2018Chandelier\u2019 was\nreleased in June of last year, her\nprofile, or lack therof, has really risen\nin prominence within the last 12\nmonths. In massive contrast to her\ncontemporaries, who don\u2019t shy away\nfrom incorperating their sexuality\ninto music, performances and videos,\nSIA shuns this idea to the extreme,\nchoosing to hide her face. Red carpet\nappearances have seen her don huge\nwigs, during performances she will\nhave her back to the audience and her\nvideos consistently star the young\ndance prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Maddie Ziegler. The\nAustralian singer isn\u2019t new to the\nbusiness. She penned Rihanna\u2019s\n\u2018We Found Love\u2019, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Pretty\nHurts\u2019 and a load of others, as well\nperforming in her own right since\nthe 90s.\nAfter decades in the industry,\npictures of her face do exist, and are\neasily Googleable. The withdrawal of\nsuch a key part of the artist\u2019s identity\nseems less about conserving privacy\nand more about making a statement\non the source of the art. Go SIA!\nVideo of the Moment\nTaylor Swift\u2019s video for \u2018Bad Blood\u2019\nbroke the Vevo records, getting 20\nmillion hits in its first 24 hours. This\nwas understandable given the massive\nsocial media preamble Swift gave\nher 34 million Instagram followers,\nwhere promotional shots of each star\nappeared at such a rate that Twtitter\nwondered whether the whole thing\nwas an elaborate prank. The video\nstarred 15 of her famous friends\nas well as collaborator Kendrick\nLamar and was directed by Joseph\nKhan, who also did Britney Spear\u2019s\n\u2018Toxic\u2019 vid. Given the combined\nnumber of followers each of these\nmodels, actresses and model/actresses\nhave, this huge number of views is\nunsurprising. But the combination of\nan iconic director, the most successful\nmodels of the moment and a huge\nWould a dinner party involving this lot end in a riot or an album? Photo Credit: Twitter, Creative Commons, Rex\n\"Kanye, are\nyou okay,\nhun?\"\n\"This\nwas Geri\nleaving the\nSpice Girls,\nor Robbie\nleaving\nTake That.\"\npop artist promoting the album of\nher life make for a video, that beyond\nthe number of hits, is successful in its\nvery obvious intention of becoming\niconic.\nBeef of the moment\nAlthough by no means a new drama,\nAzealia Banks and Iggy Azalea\u2019s\nswipes reached a new level in the\nfinancial year ending 2015. After\nseveral comments from Banks\nabout cultural appropriation,\nsimilarities between their names\nand the unsavoury Iggy lyric where\nshe calls herself a \u201crunaway slave\nmaster\u201d, tensions were high. During\nan interview with a New York\nradio station, Banks became visibly\nemotional when questioned about her\nissues with Iggy, going straight into\nher problems with appropriation,\nwhich she calls \u201ccultural smudging\u201d.\nIggy then went beyond subtweeting,\nputting out a \u201cspecial mesg [sic] for\nbanks\u201d where she blamed her rival\u2019s\n\u201cpiss poor attitude\u201d for her issues with\nthe industry before deriding her for\n\u201ccrying on the radio\u201d. Ouch.\nMoment of wonder\nWe didn\u2019t want to end on a sad note\nand Kate Bush\u2019s theatrical return to\nthe stage last summer does deserve a\nmention. Playing 22 nights is a feat in\nitself, but the \u2018Hounds of Love\u2019 singer\nseemed to please every attendee,\nwhich for such a highly anticipated\nreturn is a feat in itself.\n\n"

Cows\nhave employment rights too, you\nknow.\nAlex was famous for doing\nsomething.\nHonestly? We\u2019re not\nentirely sure what it was.\nWe do know that he always found\nthe time to look after his beloved\ndog, prioritising Flopsy (or whatever\nit was called, probably something\nunbearably middle-class) over all else.\nHe was famous for being one of\nthe only people willing to attend\nthe Imperial-run festival (note: not\nImperial Festival, which is very, very\ndifferent and should 100% be taken\nseriously by everyone, we promise\n- Ed.), which took place in some\nfar-flung field and wasn\u2019t as good as\nGlastonbury.\nHe was also well known as a big fan\nof horse riding, often indulging in a\nspot of polo.\nAll around felt this displayed the\ndepth of Alex\u2019s capacity for what is\noften called the \u2018common touch\u2019,\nan innate ability to connect with\nthe common or garden student, or\nthe rarer variant of that species, the\n\u201cUnion hack.\u201d\nAs with all great, tragic love stories,\nAlex was killed by that which he loved\nmost: his dog.\nWhile Alex slept, Flopsy mistook\nhim for a tasty morsel, and\nsubsequently devoured him whole.\nThanks in no small part to\nHangman, Chris Kaye managed\nthe unlikely feat of being\nelevated to a cult hero.\nHis work for the female population\nat Imperial was legendary, with\nhis ground-breaking policy of not\ncompletely screwing over anyone\nwishing to buy sanitary products\nfrom the Union Shop being his most\nrecognisable achievement.\nAlthough one might expect his\npopularity with the ladies to inspire\njealously in the male populace, Chris\nwas instead universally beloved by all.\nHangman interviewed an\nanonymous Felix Editor, who told us\n\u201cI love Chris! He was my favourite\nsabb, because he always took the time\nto go for a cheeky pint in the Union,\nwhatever the time of day.\n\u201cNo hour was too early for Chris\nto have a cheeky pint. He was a man\nafter my own heart.\u201d\nWhile walking through the College,\nChris often found himself being\nfollowed by his legions of adoring\nfans.\nIt was this which ultimately proved\nto be his downfall, as one day the\ncrowd following him grew too large.\nIt all started out like a normal day\nfor Chris, until word got around\ncampus that he had been spotted.\nWith the majority of students having\nfinished exams, there was a far greater\nnumber available to hound him.\nThe police were called to control\nthe throngs, with some suggesting\nthat the army should have been\ncalled in due to the sheer number of\npeople desperately attempting to get a\nglimpse of their idol, Chris Kaye.\nChris was initially believed to\nhave been killed in the crush, but he\nhas reportedly made a miraculous\nrecovery in hospital.\nHangman looks forward to seeing\nChris next year, and hopes that no\nmysterious or unfortunate accidents\nbefall him at the end of the next\nacademic year.\nSo, we have no idea what to write\nabout Pascal, also known as the\n\u2018International Man of Mystery\u2019\nor \u2018Pascal? Who\u2019s that?\u2019\nHe was apparently the Deputy\nPresident (Education), but sources\nclose to Hangman confirmed that\nvery few students were actually sure\nthis was the case.\nPascal was most famous for\nhis work as the pretty face of the\nSabbatical team, bringing his dashing\ngood looks and winning smile to his\njob.\nUnfortunately, that winning smile\nwas wiped off his face when he made\nhis final, fatal mistake: visiting the\nFelix Office.\nWhile engaging with student media\n(an activity often frowned upon), he\nmade the mistake of venturing too\nclose to one of the overladen shelves\nlining the office, filled with bound\neditions of Felix past.\nWith barely a nudge, the shelves\ncollapsed, causing the books to crash\nto the floor, covering Pascal.\nHe was killed instantly, with his last\nsight that of one of the many, many\nFelix centrefolds.\nWe hope he enjoyed it.\nWe don\u2019t really have anything\nelse to say, so here\u2019s another picture.\nNo context provided, because that\u2019s\nPascal for you. Mysterious until the\nend.\nNews in Brief: Urban dictionary says a \u2018Skett\u2019 is \u201cA fat,\nsweaty, disgusting girl that nobody wants to be with.\u201d\n\n"

Photo: James Chadwick\nJack Steadman on 24 hours of frantically ambitious activity\nSummer term rolling around\nagain can only mean one thing:\nexams. No, hang on. Two things.\nI\u2019ll try again.\nSummer term rolling around again\ncan only mean two things: exams,\nand the Musical Theatre Society\u2019s\n(MTSoc) 24-hour musical. One of\nthese is an intense, high stress period\nwhere everyone involved goes in\nfeeling massively underprepared,\nsits through the whole thing still\nfeeling massively underprepared,\nthen staggers out the other side not\nentirely sure of how they\u2019re still alive.\nThe other is, of course, the 24-hour\nmusical. Yeah, you thought you knew\nwhere I was going with that one. You\nwere wrong.\nEither way, 24-hour is typically a\nhectic blast of musical theatre that\ndoes its very best to kill everyone\ninvolved, and then still somehow\nsucker an audience into turning up\nand sitting through the results. The\nend product could, quite literally, be\nanything.\nNone of the cast, band or crew\nknow what the show is going into\nthis, making the big reveal at 19:00\non Friday evening an event in itself.\nObviously people guess the show (or\nfind out through nefarious means),\nbut it\u2019s all a big surprise. In theory.\nThis year, the reveal was made even\nlarger than usual thanks to the MD\nstitching together a reveal video,\nusing archive footage alongside\nclips of the show. As shots from\nthe miners\u2019 strike in the 80s rolled,\nfollowed by news footage of Maggie\nThatcher, it quickly became obvious\nwhere this 24 was headed. The shot of\na group of miners clustered on stage\nbelting out \u2018Once We Were Kings\u2019\nprovided the confirmation nobody\nneeded: it was Billy Elliot. For better,\nfor worse, for sheer insanity, we were\ngoing to try our hand at Billy Elliot.\nGod help us all.\nIt all develops into a bit of a blur\nafter that. The cast were given their\nscripts, and a detailed timetable of\nwhere they were meant to be and what\nthey were meant to be doing every\nminute until the show was supposed\nto go up. Yes, that included when they\nwere supposed to sleep, to the minute.\nAnd no, the show was never going to\ngo up on time. Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\nWith that, the cast were packed\noff to their singing/acting/dancing\nrehearsals, while the band were\nprepped and set up for their\nrehearsals. The crew, meanwhile,\ndisappeared for a crew curry.\nAs rehearsals got rolling it became\nclear that, for want of a better\nword, this show was a particularly\nambitious undertaking, something\nthe directing team had wasted no\ntime telling everybody within earshot\nover the couple of months running\nup to the show. Trying numbers like\n\u2018Solidarity\u2019, one of the most tightly\nchoreographed numbers in musical\ntheatre, showed the scale of what we\nwere trying to pull off, and with a\ndramatically reduced length of time\nto do it.\nAt some point during this, the crew\nreturned from their curry, scooping\nup the lighting plan and cracking\non with taking items out of storage\nand putting them in the ceiling (a\nfavourite pastime of all technicians).\nTime swept rapidly onwards, as new\nnumbers were rehearsed for the first\ntime and then hurriedly memorised\nduring the rehearsal for the next one;\nthe costume team sprinted around\nchecking everyone had brought the\nitems they were supposed to; and the\ntech team continued their inexorable\nmarch towards a stage that was visible\nto an audience. And also not covered\nin metal shavings, courtesy of the\n(still ongoing) redevelopment works.\nSometime around 02:00 (maybe\n03:00, it\u2019s a bit fuzzy), things started\nto come together. A run of \u2018Solidarity\u2019\nproduced something truly special that\nleft the hairs on the back of my neck\nstanding up. A feeling that maybe \u2013\njust maybe \u2013 we could pull this off\nstarted to infuse everyone (apart from\nthe crew, who were a little distracted\nby one of the lighting designers\nfalling ill and having to go home).\nAs morning broke, and several\ncast members who nipped out for\na quick shower at home found\nthemselves locked out of the building,\nthere was no let-up in proceedings.\nThe choreographer had her first\nbreak of the night, before diving\nstraight back in. Everyone started\nto brace themselves for the first full\nrunthrough of the show with the\nband and cast together. The crew,\nmeanwhile, carried on making noises\n(some of them intentional) in the\nUnion Concert Hall, as the sound\nteam rolled in and started setting up\nwhile the lighting rig was fine-tuned\nand focussed.\nMiraculously, everything was still\nrunning to schedule by the time the\nsitzprobe started. It\u2019s an unwritten\nlaw of theatre that nothing (least of\nall a 24-hour musical) will ever run to\nplan, let alone to time, but somehow\nthat was precisely what was going on.\nObviously, at some point that all\nhad to come to an end, and here\n(at last) came that point. No-one\u2019s\nyet worked out how everything\nslowed down, but slow down it did,\nas everything started to overrun to\nthe point of needing to cancel the\ntechnical/dress rehearsal because\nthere simply wasn\u2019t enough time\nbefore curtain up.\nWith the house still a mess, and\nbarely an hour until curtain up, the\ndecision was made to run the most\nimportant numbers, and throw in\nsome tests for the more complicated\nmoments of tech. Trying to rehearse\nover the clattering of a small army of\npeople clearing away any and all junk\nin the room, before covering the place\nin chairs can\u2019t have been easy, but the\ncast, band and crew managed it.\nAnd then, a mere half an hour\nlate, the show started. The audience\nswarmed in and took their seats,\nfilling the house, and the projection\nto open the show started.\nFrom there, everything flowed\nnear-perfectly. The whole thing felt\nlike the opening night of a show that\nhad had almost an entire week to\nget in and get setup, off the backs of\nmonths of rehearsal. It\u2019s testament\nto the hard work of the production\nteam, the sterling efforts of the cast\nand band, and the ceaseless work of\nthe crew (after the curry) that it all\ncame together in the way it did, and\nit ranks as quite possibly the best\n24-hour musical the society has ever\ndone.\nI\u2019m probably not the most qualified\nperson to make the judgement, but\nwhatever. It was great. It was absolute\nhell during the majority of that\nperiod, but at the end of it, it was\nworth every minute.\nExcept for the 20 I spent curled\nup on the floor of a meeting room,\nstaring blankly into space as the\nenormous quantity of caffeine I\nmanaged to consume finally crashed\nits way into my bloodstream. That bit,\nI could probably have done without.\nJenny Galloway as Wilkinson and the ballet girls.

This year saw over 2,700 entries to the competition,\nall vying for the top prize of \u00a330,000, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 acclaim\nand prominence in the British art world. With a variety of styles and\nsitters, sometimes the stories behind the works are more interesting than\nthe paintings themselves. As usual, entrance is free (although perhaps\nselling out to an oil giant is the real cost), so unless you\u2019re willing to go at an\nodd time you\u2019ll need to suck it up, make your way through the hell that is\nTrafalgar Square, and be prepared to barge stupid tourists out of the way to\nget a view of the paintings.\nBP Portrait Award 2015 is on at the National Portrait Gallery until 20th\nSeptember. Admission Free\nBarbara Hepworth: Sculpture for a\nModern World\nA highly anticipated exhibition, this will be the first retrospective of one\nof the most famous British sculptors of the 20th\ncentury since the 1960s.\nIf you think you don\u2019t know who Barbara Hepworth is, think again: her\nWinged Figure adorns the John Lewis flagship store, just by Oxford Circus \u2013\nin order to preserve the view she ordered that a street lamp be taken down.\nHer sculptures, with their dynamic properties, exploration of tension, and\nundulating curves, are some of the best examples of British modernism,\nequal \u2013 if not better \u2013 than those of her contemporary Henry Moore. The\nGuardian\u2019s art critic Jonathan Jones called her a \u2018second-rate artist\u2019. Fuck\nhim. Go see this show at the Tate Britain.\nBarbara Hepworth: Sculpture for a Modern World is on at the Tate Britain 24th\nJune - 25th\nOctober. Tickets from \u00a314.50\nWe Want More\nWhat with PJ Harvey taking up residence at Somerset House earlier\nthis year, and the Bj\u00f6rk retrospective currently taking up space in New\nYork\u2019s MoMA, it seems that there is a resurgence in collaboration between\npopular musicians and fine art venues. The Photographers\u2019 Gallery\npicks up on this with their latest exhibition, We Want More, which looks\nat the role visual artefacts \u2013 in particular photos \u2013 play in the creation\nof a musical artist. In a world of Instagram and Pinterest, the impact\nthat photographs can have on the identity of a musician has never\nbeen stronger; expect bold looks, creative set-ups, and simply stunning\nphotographs.\nWe Want More is on at The Photographers\u2019 Gallery from 17th\nJuly - 20th\nSeptember. Free admission\nThe World Goes Pop\nToo often is any discussion of the Pop Art movement centred solely\naround the USA, and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 the UK. Any retrospective of\nthe movement tends towards simply showing the same old Warhol and\nLichtenstein, and perhaps the odd Richard Hamilton. Luckily for us, the\nTate Modern\u2019s upcoming show explores the links between different places,\nrevealing Pop Art as an international language of protest and uprising, one\nthat questioned concepts like domesticity, the politics of the home, and the\nbody as property. Shying away from the traditional narrative, this show\nwill offer work from across the world, from Tokyo to Tehran, from Paris to\nPanama.\nThe World Goes Pop is on at the Tate Modern from 17th\nSeptember 2015 - 24th\nJanuary 2016\nOpera\nOver the summer, the opera world has a tendency to somewhat \u2018shut\ndown\u2019, as patrons eschew sitting in a dark auditorium listening to gloomy\ntales of revenge and lust in favour of outdoor pavilions, promenades, and\nPimms. At the English National Opera, just three productions remain:\nTchaikovsky\u2019s tale of greed, murder, and playing cards, The Queen of Spades,\nis on until 2nd\nJuly; a dramatic reimagination of Bizet\u2019s Carmen, which\nshifts the action to Franco\u2019s Spain, is on until 3rd\nJuly; and Mike Leigh turns\nhis attention away from JMW Turner towards Gilbert & Sullivan, in his\nproduction of The Pirates of Penzance, on until 4th\nJuly. After these finish\ntheir run, the opera season closes until September.\nLuckily, the Royal Opera House is able to pick up the slack: their roster\nof operas is also reduced, but productions continue throughout the season.\nHighlights include: Guillaume Tell, Rossini\u2019s final opera, whose complex\nmelodies will be taken on by Damiano Michieletto, in his ROH debut (29th\nJune - 17th\nJuly); Puccini\u2019s La boh\u00e8me, a classic in the opera repertoire, with\nits dark tale of love and loss, also makes an appearance, with a revival of the\n1974 production (23rd\nMay - 16th\nJuly); and Shakespeare\u2019s comic hero Falstaff\nmakes an appearance in Verdi\u2019s hilarious, witty opera, which is relocated\nto 1950s England (6-18th\nJuly). For those of you who prefer a slightly more\nmodern take on opera, the ROH is also putting on a double programme\nof chamber operas by composer Harrison Birtwistle, to celebrate his 80th\nbirthday, celebrated last year: The Corridor, which premiered at the 62nd\nAldeburgh Festival, and The Cure, which will be having its debut at the\nROH. Both are collaborations with the librettist David Harsent, a long-time\ncollaborator of Birtwistle, and centre around his obsession with classical\nmythology.\nBallet & Dance\nFans of dance are luckier than the opera buffs: summer sees the ballet\nschools putting on a number of recitals and shows, displaying what they\nhave been working on throughout the year. At the Royal Opera House,\nthe Royal Ballet School have their annual summer performances in the\nLinbury Studio from 1-4th\nJuly, showing off the school\u2019s talent, and the\nAnnual Performance (12th\nJuly), which gives a taste of the stage to the entire\nschool, which ranges from eleven year olds to graduates, about to embark in\na career in ballet. Another ROH highlight is Whelan/Watson: Other Stories\n(9-12th\nJuly), a collection of works for American dancer Wendy Whelan\nand Royal Ballet Principal Edward Watson \u2013 one of the works is by Arthur\nPita, the choreographer behind the production of The Metamorphosis with\nwhich Watson made his name, winning the Olivier Award for Outstanding\nAchievement in Dance for his role as Gregor Samsa.\nSadler\u2019s Wells has a number of productions on over the summer,\nwith one highlight being Matthew Bourne\u2019s The Car Man (14th\nJuly - 9th\nAugust), which first premiered in 2000. The production\u2019s longevity is\nonly a testament to its ingenuity: loosely based on Bizet\u2019s opera, The\nCar Man updates the action to 1950s Americana, introducing elements\nof physicality, lust, and homoeroticism into the mix. Also on offer is\nTOROBAKA, a collaboration between the celebrated dance artist Akram\nKhan, and the award-winning flamenco dancer Israel Galv\u00e1n. The resulting\nwork brings together two very different dance cultures into one sublime\nshow (30th\nJune \u2013 5th\nJuly)\nMeanwhile, at the English National Opera, we have the last recitals of\nFrench dancer Sylvie Guillem, possibly one of the most highly-regarded\nartists alive today. A continuation of her sell-out run at Sadler\u2019s Wells, the\nprogramme sees Guillem going out in triumph, with a quartet of daring,\nmodern works that show off her fluid movement and easy sensuality (28th\nJuly - 2nd\nAugust). Another ENO highlight is their production of Cinderella,\nwhich will run from 8-11th\nJuly. Choreographed by Cheistopher Wheeldon,\nthe internationally acclaimed artist, and scored by Prokofiev, this show\nmade its debut with the Dutch National Ballet in 2012, where it recieved a\nglowing reception from fans and critics.\nUne Baignade, Asni\u00e8res by\nGeorges Pierre Seurat, 1884.

With\nthe Entry Pass scheme for 16-25\nyear olds providing \u00a35 tickets to\nevery show, and the new Friday\nRush system providing \u00a320 seats to\nsold-out shows each week, there\u2019s\nno excuse not to catch the work of\nBritain\u2019s leading producing theatre.\nThe Motherf**cker with the\nHat\nAlready playing, this Tony\nnominated play by Stephen Adly\nGuirgis looks at the nature of love\nand addiction in New York City.

The show is performed\nby two people: Crouch himself, and a\ndifferent actor for each performance.\nThe actors involved won\u2019t have seen\nor read a word of what they\u2019re about\nto engage with, leading to a wide\narray of potential paths for the actors\nto explore.\nFrom 23rd\nJune - 15th\nJuly, Temporary\nTheatre\nOur Country\u2019s Good\nThe tale of the birth of Australia\nas we now know it, thanks to the\nactions of the English government.\nIn 1788, the first ship loaded with\nEnglish convicts lands in Botany\nBay.

Fresh off\nthe back of The Vote, broadcast live on election night, and currently in the\nmiddle of a run of the critically acclaimed Temple, there\u2019s still plenty of life\nleft in one of London\u2019s most consistently exciting and innovative theatres.\nSplendour\nA new play by Abi Morgan, Splendour is the story of four women, brought\ntogether for one moment. A photojournalist, the wife of the dictator she is\nhere to photograph, the wife\u2019s best friend and an interpreter all await the\narrival of an unnamed dictator. All four have secrets, all four are in danger,\nand all four stand in a Presidential Palace on the day of a revolution.\n30th\nJuly - 26th\nSeptember.

The best it\u2019ll\never do is \u2018The second-best Jurassic\nPark film\u2019.\nBut if you look at it as a summer\nblockbuster, a big, dumb dinosaur\nfilm that is hugely enjoyable to watch,\nit hits the nail on the head.\nI have not seen a film I have\nenjoyed this much in a very long\ntime. Because that is entirely what the\nfilm is trying to do.\nPointless reboot is a term that gets\nflung around a lot these days, but in\nJurassic World\u2019s case, it just isn\u2019t true.\nIt\u2019s not a reboot. It\u2019s a clever sequel.\nThe new park is now open to the\nworld, full of dinosaurs and lots of\nyummy tourists to eat, attack and\nmaim as the plot deems appropriate.\nYou\u2019ve got little baby herbivore\ndinosaurs to go riding on, or you can\nwatch a big, scary water dinosaur eat\nan entire shark.\nIf aquatic dinosaurs don\u2019t do it\nfor you, why not go and watch the\nT-Rex get fed? Or go explore the\nenclosures of some of the more\nlaid-back dinosaurs in your very own\npersonable bubble, complete with\nannoying tour guide video.\nFor characters we\u2019ve got the\nguy who knows everything about\ndinosaurs, Owen (Chris Pratt in\none of his many hero roles after\nGuardians of the Galaxy made us\nrealise that he\u2019s actually kinda hot),\nand the woman who is sort of knows\nthings but is mostly there to be a\nlove interest (Bryce Dallas Howard)\nwith questionable fashion choices\n(seriously, who decides to wear heels\nwhen you might be running away\nfrom a big hungry dinosaur).\nThere\u2019s also the rich old man who\nowns the park, and the obligatory\nannoying kids, who actually manage\nto not be too annoying due the fact\nthat the film makers realised that if\nall the kids do is cry and scream noone is going to like your film.\nThe film\u2019s plot is kicked off when,\nin a bid to make an even more\nexciting exhibit to get the tourists\ncome flooding in, the scientists design\ntheir own dinosuar.\nThe Indominus Rex is pretty much\na big T-Rex without the hilariously\nstunted arms, and it is awesome to\nlook to look at.\nOf course, Indy doesn\u2019t much like\nbeing locked up, so she escapes. And\nthat\u2019s when everything goes majorly\nwrong, and where the film goes so\nright.\nJurassic Park could focus on its\ncharacters because there were so few\npeople in danger.\nNow we\u2019re talking thousands rather\nthan ten, and there is death and\ndestruction galore.\nThe main focus of the film is the\ndinosaurs.\nAlmost everything the humans\ndo is pretty much just so you can see\nmore of the dinosaurs.\nYou\u2019ve got dinosaurs fighting\ndinosaurs, dinosaurs killing\ndinosaurs, dinosaurs eating\ndinosaurs, dinosaurs freeing\ndinosaurs to cause even more\nproblems in the park. You\u2019ve got\ndinosaurs killing, eating, chasing,\nscaring and exciting people. And then\nyou\u2019ve got people training dinosaurs.\nWhen the first trailers dropped and\npeople saw the raptors being trained,\npretty much no-one liked the idea.\nBut the film pulls it off excellently,\nwith the raptors still having the same\nthreat they always did, you\u2019re just way\nmore attached to them.\nNods to the original are plentiful\nbut never overdone. This film is set\ntwenty-odd years in the future on the\nsame island as the original.\nThe line where the new owner\nrecalls how John Hammond told\nhim to \u2018spare no expense\u2019 is fantastic,\nand visiting the old visitor centre is\nenjoyable for people who have seen\nthe original film, but it is also a cool,\ncreepy setting that new viewer will\nfind just as interesting.\nThere really are only a couple of\nissues with the film.\nInGen as a secondary villain\nseems tacked on and a bit pointless.\nWith such a strong primary villain\n(y\u2019know, the dinosaur) having a\nsecond one felt more like sequel bait\nthan actually adding to the film.\nThe other is the lack of feathers.\nJust as Jurassic Park firmly implanted\ndinosaurs in the public\u2019s mind, this\nfilm could have done the same with\nfeathers.\nThough it\u2019s a shame that they\nultimately decided against doing this,\nit does not actually detract from the\nfilm in any major way.\nJurassic World is a hugely enjoyable\nfilm filled with exactly what you\nwant, tons and tons of dinosaurs.\nIt doesn\u2019t do anything particularly\nclever with characters, or story.\nIt\u2019s probably not going to win any\nOscars (though the special effects\ncould get a nod), but it\u2019s not trying to.\nIt\u2019s trying to be fun, and if you are a\nkid you are going to enjoy this just as\nmuch as the original. And really, isn\u2019t\nthat the point?\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I reckon a dinosaur did this. Photo: Colin Trevorrow/Universal (also below)\n\"Nods\nto the\noriginal are\nplentiful,\nbut never\noverdone.\"\n\"If all the\nkids do is\nscream and\ncry no-one\nis going to\nlike your\nfilm.\"\nVelociraptors make up the majority of Chris Pratt\u2019s fan base.\nJack Steadman gets ready for the next batch of blockbusters\nSummer of cinema\nWith the summer upon us,\nit means the inevitable\nonslaught of blockbusters.\nBy normal standards, 2015\u2019s a\npretty quiet year for the summer,\nwith most of this year\u2019s big hitters\neither already out, or landing towards\nChristmas time (Star Wars, I\u2019m\nlooking at you).\nBut don\u2019t worry \u2013 once you\u2019ve\nfinally made your way through\nthe likes of Mad Max: Fury Road\n(seriously, go and watch it again\nalready) and Jurassic World (I have\nno opinions on this yet), there\u2019s still\nplenty of cinema to indulge in.\nWe\u2019ve got unnecessary reboots\n(Terminator), yet more sequels (Ted),\nthe odd genuinely exciting new work\n(Inside Out) and plenty more besides.\nWe also have a healthy dose of\nsarcasm about all of them, because\nthat\u2019s just how we roll.\nMinions (26th\nJune)\nAs if your life wasn\u2019t already\noverflowing with the yellow critters\nfrom the Despicable Me series, they\u2019re\nback in an all-new film of their own.\nThat\u2019s right, there\u2019s a whole film\ncomprised exclusively of the barely\ncomprehensible, impossibly idiotic\nMinions. Because stealing the show\nin two films and commanding an\nentire series of adverts for Sky weren\u2019t\nenough. Thanks, Universal.\nHaving said that, this\u2019ll probably\nstill be fairly amusing. Minions,\ndespite being literally everywhere, are\nstill funny.\nTerminator Genisys (3rd\nJuly)\nDid somebody say \u201cunnecessary\nreboot\u201d? I mean, I definitely did, but\njust in case someone else felt like\nchiming in with that opinion. Because\nthat\u2019s what we\u2019re getting.\nThe Terminator franchise lumbers\nback to life following two attempted\nmurders via film \u2013 the so-so third\nentry (Rise of the Machines) and the\ndownright dire Terminator Salvation.\nDespite director McG\u2019s best efforts,\nthe series survives. And it\u2019s bringing\nback the original Terminator, for real\nthis time.\nIt\u2019s also completely changing\nthe game, ending up in a sort of\nparallel universe where the original\nTerminator brought up an orphaned\nSarah Connor (now played by Emilia\nClarke). So there\u2019s that.\nTrailers for the film have done\ntheir best to spoil all of the major\nplot twists, but hopefully there\u2019s still\nsomething up the sleeve of director\nAlan Taylor, fresh off the likes of\nGame of Thrones and Thor: The Dark\nWorld. Clearly not a dictionary,\nhowever.\nTed 2 (10th\nJuly)\nSeth MacFarlane\u2019s foul-mouthed\nteddy bear makes his second\nappearance in the inevitable sequel to\nthe hit comedy.\nThe likes of Liam Neeson and\nAmanda Seyfried join the cast, with\nthe latter playing a lawyer whose\nname bears an uncanny resemblance\nto another popular film star. Mark\nWahlberg returns as Ted\u2019s \u201cthunder\nbuddy for life\u201d John, although Mila\nKunis opts not to reappear as his\ngirlfriend. Fair enough.\nThe film is set to centre around\nTed\u2019s attempts to have a baby with his\n(human) girlfriend, and his need to\nprove he is a person in the eyes of the\nlaw before this is allowed. Whether\nyou enjoy it or not is likely to depend\non your opinions of the first film, of\nFamily Guy, and of Seth MacFarlane\u2019s\nwork in general.\nAnt-Man (17th\nJuly)\nAdmit it, you forgot this was coming\nout, didn\u2019t you? Originally the work\nof Edgar Wright, the latest Marvel\nfilm (and the first of Phase 3) is now\nunder the command of Peyton Reed,\nthe man behind Yes Man.\nNot the most promising of CVs, but\nthe latest trailer suggests there\u2019s much\nto be hopeful for.\nPaul Rudd\u2019s Scott Lang is a\ncriminal, but one given a chance at\nredemption by scientist Dr Hank\nPym. Armed with a suit that allows\nhim to shrink (but increase his\nstrength in the process), he\u2019s tasked\nwith carrying out a heist like no other.\nAnt-Man looks to be one of the\nMarvel films that leans more\nheavily towards the comedy side of\nthings, if Thomas the Tank Engine\u2019s\nappearance in the trailer is anything\nto go by, and there\u2019s still plenty to be\nhopeful for. Marvel haven\u2019t put a foot\nwrong yet.\nInside Out (24th\nJuly)\nPixar haven\u2019t been on their best form\nof late, trapped as they are in the land\nof sequels. The fact that Inside Out\nis a new IP from some of cinema\u2019s\ngreatest minds should be exciting\nenough. The fact that the early\nreviews are already declaring it to be\namongst Pixar\u2019s finest work \u2013 a heady\nclaim \u2013 should be even more so.\nSet inside the mind of Riley,\nan 11 year-old-girl, Inside Out\nfollows the personifications of the\nemotions inside her head, lead by\nJoy (Amy Poehler). After a move\nacross the States, Joy and Sadness\nfind themselves trapped in the far\ncorners of Riley\u2019s mind, and Anger,\nFear and Disgust are left in charge in\nHeadquarters.\nThe only caption I could think of was \u2018toasty\u2019. You try doing better. Photo: Disney/Pixar/Pete Docter\n\"A new IP\nfrom some\nof cinema\u2019s\ngreatest\nminds\nshould be\nexciting\nenough.\"\n\"Trailers\nfor the\nfilm have\ndone their\nbest to\nspoil all of\nthe major\nplot twists.\"\nUsed this layout before?

I\u2019m now delighted to reveal the official name of both\nsites: Imperial West will become the White City Campus, while Imperial\nVery West is now confirmed as the Heathrow Campus.\nBoth of these sites are steeped in history - White City takes its name from\nthe white marble covering the exhibition pavillions that once sat there\nduring the 1909 Imperial International Exhibition (note how Imperial was\nalready a global, world-leading institution, even at the very beginning!).\nHeathrow, meanwhile, takes its name from the famous airport in the\nlocal area - another example of our enormous international links with\nthe global community!\nBut to counter that good news, we must also say \u2018vale\u2019 (that\u2019s \u201cgoodbye\u201d,\nto all you well-educated-but-not-Latin-educated folks!) to some of our\nwonderful staff.\nAmong them are the Vice Provosts for Student Voice (following the\nresults of the informal review into his position), Halls Demolition (as our\ncurrent plans for demolition have now all been carried out) and Kettling\n(as this service as now been outsourced to the Metropolitan Police).\nWe are also looking for new Vice Provosts for Halls Construction and\nCampus Naming Services - but more on that one another time!\nHave a productive, cohesive, collaborative and happy day!\n\n"

We recap\nthe stories we\u2019ve brought to you this\nyear, and what to watch out for next\nyear.\nBUAV hit our front pages twice\nthis year; firstly, the animal rights\norganisation made headlines back\nin October when the Home Office\ninvestigation, triggered by their\nundercover investigation into animal\ntesting at the college, was completed.\nThe investigation found at the time\nthat many of the BUAV allegations\nwere unsubstantiated, and only five\ncases of non-compliance were found.\nDespite this, BUAV claimed\nin May that the government\nhad misrepresented the group\nby reporting 180 instead of 18\ncomplaints made. BUAV were\nsuccessful in their application for\na judicial review against the Home\nOffice, and their plight is ongoing.\nJudicial reviews can take several\nmonths, and BUAV will be hoping\nit will result in tougher sanctions\nagainst Imperial. We\u2019ll probably hear\nthe result at some point next year.\nWe also investigated the cuts to the\namenities funds in halls this year,\nsomething that caused contention\nfor hall seniors and wardens after\nthey tried to provide a freshers\nweek experience on a shoestring.\nThe funding, that comes from the\ntotal rent that students pay at the\nbeginning of each term, was cut from\nas high as \u00a33.50 down to \u00a31.50 per\nperson per week, meaning many\nactivities had to be cut as a result of\nthe slashed budget.\nAlthough Felix was told that the\ncuts were to ensure the savings\nwould \u201cGo back into the pockets\nof students,\u201d and despite asking\nrepeatedly for figures to show this\nis the case, we were unable to verify\nthat these cuts meant students were\npaying less for rent.\nMany speculated that the money\nwas going back into the pockets of\ncampus services.\nWe covered the antics of the rugby\nteams too in Autumn term. The first\nXV of ICURFC were suspended back\nin October after stripping on a tube\nback from West London, causing the\ntube to come to a halt and commuters\nasked to disembark from the tube as\na result. The team was temporarily\nsuspended as the British Transport\nPolice investigated the matter, and\na week later were joined in club\npurgatory by the Medic rugby team\nafter a window was broken on a coach\nthey were using during a tour trip to\nBristol.\nThe ICURFC was suspended for a\ntotal of two weeks, the same period\nthe Medicals were also suspended for.\nStudents directly involved were also\nmade to perform some sort of \u201cUnion\nservice.\u201d\nThe Captain of the ICURFC was\nalso threatened with a vote of no-confidence, with Imperial College\nUnion stating that he had lied to\nthem during their investigation.\nHowever, after a petition collected\nover 500 signatures in support of the\nplayer, he lived to play another day\nas Union Council voted against the\nmotion.\nSome of the many sportsmen and\nwomen who attended Council for\nthe debate expressed a feeling that\nthe Union was working against clubs\nrather than with them.\nThe Medicals rugby team was not\nas fortunate; with their suspension\nmeaning they would have to forfeit\nseveral key games, they would lose\nmoney from BUCS fines and also,\nwith a ban on socialising, they could\nno longer host the popular Christmas\nBop, based at the Reynolds bar. They\nappealed against the sanctions, but\nthe Trustee Board, the highest board\nwithin the Union, rejected the appeal.\n\u201cPublish and Perish\u201d was Felix\u2019s\nfront page in December, as a scandal\nerupted over the suicide of the late\nprofessor Stefan Grimm.\nAn email was sent posthumously\nunder Grimm\u2019s name alleging\nthat the College was being run as\na \u201cbusiness\u201d, with the deceased\nacademic apparently being told to\nobtain an increased amount of grant\nfunding or resign.\nScience blogger David Colquhoun\ncondemned the College\u2019s attitude,\narguing for a public inquiry into\nGrimm\u2019s death.\nThe College strongly denied that\nProfessor Grimm was under formal\nreview and launched a formal review\nin the circumstances surrounding\nGrimm\u2019s death. The coroner\u2019s report\nfound that Grimm\u2019s suicide was likely\nattributable to the pressure arising\nfrom grant applications, while College\nthemselves said they don\u2019t know if\nchanges to College policies suggested\nin the internal review would have\nprevented his death.\nAlso in February, a paper was\nbrought to Union Council, the effect\nbeing College allowing Council\nmembers to determine hall rents\nfor the following year. In this paper,\nstudents learnt the intention to close\nboth Weeks and Pembridge halls.\nCollege\u2019s argument for the closure\nof the halls was due to their alleged\nhigh cost of refurbishment. Debra\nHumphries, the Vice-Provost\n(Education) also argued that the\nCollege could make better use of the\nspace in both \u201cacademic\u201d and \u201cnonacademic\u201d uses.\nWhilst Council resolved to\ncampaign against closure of\nPembridge, they initially voted to\nnot campaign against the closure\nof Weeks. When College later\nannounced their intention to close\nthe hall for the following year,\nresidents of Weeks launched a\ncampaign protesting against the\nCollege\u2019s decision.\nThis later, through an emergency\nmeeting of Council, lead to the\noriginal decision to not oppose the\nclosure being overturned. A campaign\nwas also initiated to lobby College\nto be more transparent in decision\nmaking known as #ICAProblem,\nalthough how this campaign has\nprogressed is unknown.\nNonetheless, College have\ncontinued with their plan to close\nWeeks, and it will not be available for\nstudents starting next year. A party\nwill be held today to commemorate\nthe hall.\nMarch\u2019s Varsity brought\naccusations of misogyny upon Sport\nImperial, when members of the\nfemale rugby team reported abuse\nfrom a member of staff, who was\nheard over a radio saying, \u201cI don\u2019t\ncare how those fat girls get home\u201d.\nAs well as this, there was\ninsufficient transport to for all\nmembers of the female rugby team,\nwho hadn\u2019t played at The Stoop\nbefore. In May, an investigation\nconducted by the college with\nassistance from the union concluded\nthat the team had been \u201cmade a\nmockery of\u201d. A letter of apology\nA selection of our front pages. Clockwise from top left: Fifth and sixth year medical students suffer from financial struggles; Medics rugby team suspended over smashing a coach\nwindow; BUAV allegations of animal cruelty at Imperial dropped by the Home Office; Imperial student convicted of owning child pornography; Students protest against the closure of\nWeeks hall. Photo: various\nto the team from president Alice\nGast referred to the situation as\n\u201cunacceptable\u201d the report concluded\nthat changes were needed in\nrelation to the conduct of staff and\norganisation of future sports events.\nRecommendations included\ncommissioning research into the\nissue of sexism in sport, informed\nby workshops involving Imperial\nstudents and changing the format\nof Varsity to give fixtures equal\nprominence. There was a question\nmark over the nature of Varsity itself,\nwith one point questioning whether\nit should matches should continue as\n\u201cpurely internal competitions\u201d.\nAlthough the report was announced\nin response to complaints of staff\nsexism from the female rugby team,\nseveral points concentrated on the\nculture of alcohol consumption at the\nevent. It was firmly stated that the\nsale of spirits onsite will be prohibited\nin the future with prevention of\nbringing alcohol in being strictly\nenforced.\n\u201cAlcohol abuse\u201d in general was\nmentioned as an issue for focus for\nother departments. Are we looking\nat an alcohol free future for Varsity?\nIt\u2019s unlikely; our sources say spirits\nweren\u2019t available at the stoop this year\nanyway, and the search process at the\ndoor is pretty comprehensive. We\u2019ll\nlikely see a change in the timetable of\nVarsity matches, and organisation of\ntransport, but the unequal treatment\nof teams due to sex, as the rugby\nplayers claimed, may be a harder issue\nto detect.\nA week before the Imperial Festival\ntook over campus, a student was\nsentenced to 18 months in prison for\nthe possession of 30,000 child porn\nimages. Nur Nordin, a third year\nMathematician, was found with a\nlife-size mannequin of a young boy\nwhen police, who\u2019d been notified\nabout suspicious activity coming\nfrom his account, raided his address\n\"Many\nspeculated\nthat the\nmoney was\ngoing back\ninto the\npockets of\ncampus\nservices.\"\n\"Students\ndirectly\ninvolved\nwere also\nmade to\nperform\nsome sort\nof \u201cUnion\nservice.\u201d\"\n\"March\u2019s\nVarsity\nbrought\naccusations\nof\nmisogyny\nupon Sport\nImperial\"\n\"a student\nwas\nsentenced\nto 18\nmonths\nin prison\nfor the\npossession\nof 30,000\nchild porn\nimages\"\nin Queensborough Terrace.\nMany of the images were Category\nA, with the Metropolitan Police\nsaying they were some of the most\nextreme their specialist officers had\never seen. Pleading guilty to all 17\ncounts, including making indecent\nimages of children within intent to\ndistribute.\nThe Malay student, who was on a\nscholarship paid for by the Malaysian\ngovernment, has had his studentship\nat Imperial revoked, but a member\nof the council that provided the\nscholarship has commented that\nNordin\u2019s funding may be restored,\nand he could be allowed to attend a\nuniversity in his home country. It\u2019s\nlikely that he will face deportation\nupon release, and if he doesn\u2019t serve\nthe full term, we may hear of his\neducation continuing abroad within\nthe next year.\nThis year we saw several Felix\nheadlines concerning the mental\nwellbeing of students, and their\nwelfare in general. In January, we also\nran the results of a survey of final\nyear medical school students, which\nfound that 50% of respondents said\nthat their financial concerns affect\ntheir mental health. The survey\nresults sparked debate over the cuts\nto funding medical students in their\nfinal year face once their Imperial\nbursary is removed for their fifth and\nsixth year of study.\nIn May, we also published the\nfindings of the student-led campaign\nMentality, which found that 3 out\nof 4 students suffer from extreme\nlevels of stress or have had a mental\nhealth condition. Students were\ntwice as likely to be stressed who\nattend Imperial compared to other\nuniversities in the UK.\nExam organisation and copy\nediting exam scripts within certain\ndepartments has also not fared well\nthis year. The business school saw\na blackboard crash resulting in an\nonline test having to be suspended\nshortly before Christmas, and then\nlater had to investigate the make-up\ntest after rumours of plagiarism.\nThere was also case of a handful of\nundergraduate students sitting exam\npapers meant for MSc students in\nAeronautics.\nIn February, we ran a piece about\na series of assessment mistakes in\nPhysics Assessed Problem sheets\nand in a revision test, and students\nbeing told to take \u201cIt on the chin...\nit is a drop in the ocean,\u201d by a senior\nlecturer within the department.\nFollowing that, second year\nstudents were set an impossible exam\nquestion only a couple of weeks ago,\nand as far as Felix is aware, nothing\nwill be rectified for certain until exam\nscripts are assessed.\nAll in all, the year has been far from\ndull, with plenty of stories to keep us\nin business for another year. With\nsome of these still developing, we\nwill be following them through the\nSummer and into the next academic\nyear, so make sure to pick up a copy.\n\n"

    "content": "17 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n19.06.2015\nTelevision Editors Guila Gabrielli & John Park\nTelevision\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJack Steadman looks back at the latest season of Game of Thrones\nStill surviving... still thriving?\nAnother year, another season\nof Game of Thrones draws to\na close.\nThis year marks a key milestone\nin the adaptation however, as with\nthe end of season closer \u201cMother\u2019s\nMercy\u201d the show has officially caught\nup with the books.\nDespite adamant assurances from\nshowrunners David Benioff and D.\nB. Weiss that it wouldn\u2019t be a case of\n\u2018one season, one book\u2019, it all seems to\nhave turned out that way.\nSome clever merging of characters\ncombined with streamlined storylines\nmeans that, even with judicious\nblurring of the lines between books,\nseason five\u2019s ending matches up near\nperfectly with book five, A Dance with\nDragons.\nIt\u2019s hard for it not to feel like a\nconscious decision on the part of\nthe showrunners \u2013 doing it this way\nbuys George R. R. Martin enough\ntime to finish and publish book six,\nThe Winds of Winter before the show\nreturns next spring.\nCompared to the books, the series\nhas managed to avoid feeling like\nit\u2019s treading water too heavily at any\npoint, although not without some\ndifficulties.\nEvents in \u2018Mother\u2019s Mercy\u2019\nmanaged the interesting feat of using\nmoments from earlier in the book to\nfinish off storylines, chopping and\nchanging as Benioff and Weiss felt\nnecessary, not least in Arya\u2019s plotline.\nOut of everyone, Arya is perhaps\nthe biggest victim of Martin\u2019s\ntendency to tread water in the later\nnovels, leading to her final scenes\nmanaging the entertaining feat of\ncovering events that have already\nhappened in the books at the same\ntime as handling those that are still\nyet to come.\nIt sounds silly on paper \u2013 using\nsomething that should have happened\nseveral episodes ago to round up a\nstoryline that\u2019s now overtaken the\nbooks \u2013 but it\u2019s typical of Benioff and\nWeiss\u2019 intelligent, careful approach to\nhow they handle the delicate situation\nthey find themselves in.\nUntil now, their audience has sat\nin two camps \u2013 those who have read\nthe books, and those who haven\u2019t,\nresulting in two very different\nviewing experiences.\nFor those already in the know for\nevents coming up, the joy was in the\nadaptation itself, in finally seeing the\nbooks come to life (and, increasingly,\nseeing how the showrunners chose to\nalter the original plot lines, often for\nthe better).\nThere was also a perverse glee in\nwatching the damage wrought by\nthe show\u2019s twists and turns on the\nunsuspecting fresh TV audience, with\nthe likes of the Red Wedding, the\nPurple Wedding (lots of capitalised\nweddings in this show) and the\ndemise of the Red Viper all provoking\na highly entertaining response from\nthe non-book reading viewers.\nThe show has been impossibly\nsuccessful at straddling that tightrope\nbetween audiences, with this series\nmarking the point where the team\nbehind it all had to make some tough\ndecisions about how much of the\nfuture (which is already known to the\npair) to reveal before Martin has the\nchance.\nThe answer, as it turns out, was\nfar more than most people were\nexpecting, with the eighth episode\n\u2018Hardhome\u2019 marking a watershed for\nthe show on that front.\nEasily one of the best episodes\nof the entire run, \u201cHardhome\u201d\ntook some liberties with the books,\nturning a previously off-screen battle\nfeaturing no major characters into\na full-blown on-screen one, but also\nshowed the true stakes at play in this\nseries.\nIt\u2019s been all about politics up to\nnow. Mostly, anyway.\nAll about the titular game of\nthrones where, as Aiden Gillen\u2019s\nLittlefinger so memorably puts it:\n\u201cYou win or you die.\u201d\nChoosing the title of the first\nbook in the series, rather than its\nactual name, as the title for the TV\nadaptation now feels very, very\ndeliberate.\nCalling it A Song of Ice and Fire\nmight occasionally remind viewers\nof the larger game taking place in\nWesteros.\nFull credit to Benioff and Weiss for\nburying that one.\nAs \u2018Hardhome\u2019 reminded everyone,\nthere is a much, much bigger threat to\neveryone in Westeros than the antics\nof the ruling families, arriving in the\nshape of the White Walkers and their\narmy of the undead.\nWe saw them in the very first scene\nof the entire series (also true of the\nbooks), and they\u2019ve dipped in and\nout since then, but it\u2019s been very easy\nto forget the massing threat on the\nnorth side of the Wall.\nNo longer. If season five is\nremembered for nothing else, let it be\nthat: this was the season that blew the\nwhole thing wide open. The stakes are\nraised. The war is truly underway.\nIt\u2019s not the only thing that season\nfive will be remembered for, though,\nfor better and for worse. Mainly for\nworse.\nThe show got itself into hot water\nwith yet another use of sexual\nviolence as a plot-driving device,\nagain against one of the major female\ncharacters.\nWhereas the infamous scene in\nseason four felt like a mistake \u2013 a\nscene that was intended one way, but\nfilmed (and written) in such a way\nthat it felt inescapably wrong \u2013 here\nwas something that, to an audience at\nlarge, felt completely unjustifiable.\nIt\u2019s undeniably troubling, that\u2019s\nfor sure, but the treatment in later\nepisodes went some way to improving\nthe situation (confirmation, if any\nwere needed, that shows must be\ntaken as a whole, at least as seasons,\nrather than just judged on individual\nepisodes), as the writers just about\nmanaged to veer away from using\nthe rape as part of a male character\u2019s\narc, instead tying it to the agency of\nthe female in question and using it to\ndrive her arc forwards.\nMishandled? A little. As wholly\nunjustified as the internet outcry\nwould have you believe? Probably not.\nGame of Thrones has always courted\ncontroversy, sometimes for legitimate\nreasons, other times simply because\nit accidentally sailed a little too close\nto the wind, and this season was no\nexception.\nBut the show has always been (and\nhopefully will always be) more than\nthat, better than that.\nGoing by the strength of the\nclosing few episodes of this season, it\npromises to maintain the impossibly\nhigh bar of standards it has set for\nitself, and promises to keep leading\nthe charge for quality television\nprogramming everywhere.\nIf you want my main concern, it\u2019s\nlooking almost certain that the show\nwill get to the end before the books\ndo.\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll cope with not\nknowing what\u2019s coming next.\nAt least one of the men in this image knows nothing. Photo: HBO\n\"The stakes\nare raised.\nThe war\nis truly\nunderway.\"\n\"It\u2019s been\nall about\npolitics\nup to now.\nMostly,\nanyway.\"\n\n"

Now, that I\nhave seen some of the less good side,\nmy views are changed.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not an\nanti-social person or a xenophobe\nwho is scared of looking into a\nforeigner\u2019s eyes. I enjoy living in\na diverse society as much as many\nof you and I still believe that being\nable to adapt yourself to this kind of\nenvironment is one of the key skills\nto your success in professional and\neveryday life.\nYet, it is also this diversity that\ncan breed problems. Being part of a\ndiverse community can also cause a\nlot of pressure, and that can lead into\nmental breakdown or depression.\nTherefore, this article will point out\nthe dark sides of living in a highly\ndiverse society and how to tackle with\nthese problems.\nFrom my experience, there are\nalways three common problems from\nliving in a diverse city wherever in\nthe world.\nCulture Shock\nFrom where I\u2019m from, bargaining the\nprice is very common and we do it\nall the time. But once, I tried this in\nanother country and the shop seller\npointed the finger at me and threw\nme out of the shop straight away.\nStunned for five seconds, I learnt\nlater that it was considered rude to\nbargain the price there.\nThis is what I mean by culture\nshock and it has happened to me\nin London. Cultural difference is a\nvery common thing. Even you and\nyour siblings might prefer different\nkinds of music. It is normal that\npeople from different backgrounds or\norigins will have different norms, and\nthese can sometimes contradict one\nanother quite spectacularly.\nWhat I do to avoid this problem\nis to assume that people will not\nalways approach things in the same\nway I do. You can be surprised but\ndon\u2019t be shocked. Once you do not\nNot everything about diversity is always inspiring and positive. It can be a scary and alienating experience.\nPhoto: Duncan Philips\nPheerawat Ratnitisakul discusses about the lows of\ndiversity in London\u2019s Melting Pot\n\"Sometimes\nI feel lost\namong\npeople and\nfeel that\nno one will\nunderstand\nme.\"\n\"Being a\npart of a\ndiverse\ncommunity\ncan also\ncause a\nlot of\npressure.\"\nhave expectations based on your own\nculture, you will not be shaken or\ndisappointed. Instead, everything you\nsee will be a new discovery for you!\nDiscrimination\nRacism, unfair treatment or insult,\ndon\u2019t let that get the best of you!\nIn a diverse culture, people can be\nvery judgmental of others that are\ndifferent from them. This is because\npeople can feel insecure when\nhanging around people they are not\nfamiliar with. So, they create a kind of\nbarrier against the unfamiliar so that\nthey can feel safe in their comfort\nzone.\nSometimes, the prejudice is not\neven malicious, but still painful to\nbe misunderstood. It can be just an\noffhand comment that makes you\nwonder if you\u2019re a walking stereotype.\nNever ever let it discourage you!\nRemember, you did nothing wrong\nand have no reason to feel bad about\nyourself. Prove to yourself that you\nare not what they think you are. But\nif they are still ignorant of this, who\ncares! They\u2019re not the only people\nin the world and there\u2019re no good\nreasons for you to pay attention to\nthese people for any longer.\nLoneliness\nIronically, I find that living in a\nplace where there is a lot of diversity\ncan often be a lonely experience.\nSometimes, I feel lost among people\nand feel that no-one will understand\nme. But don\u2019t worry! You feel that\nway because you\u2019re out of your\ncomfort zone with the people similar\nto you.\nNo-one but yourself can solve this\nproblem. Change your attitude and\ncreate your own comfort zone in this\ndiversity! Change from the comfort\nzone that consists of people from the\nsame country into a zone consisting\nof people with similar interests or\npassions such as learning languages\nand playing tennis.

Some people posted saying\nthey were also students at Imperial,\nalthough many of the anonymous\nposts on the threads seemed to be\nmade by people external to the\nuniversity. One user posted that they\nhad registered a campaign through\nthe Union website, called \u201cHitler did\nnothing wrong.\u201d\nAfter the thread was brought to\nthe attention of Union staff, the\nsubmission form was put behind\nlogin entry, meaning afterwards\nstudents could only vote once.\nThe Union website announced the\nwinning name, The Foundry, last\nWednesday, after discounting any\nsuggestions made during the period\nof peak activity last weekend that\nappeared to have originated from\n4chan users.\nFelix spoke to Chris Kaye Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) and Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) elect,\nwho will be working closely with the\nbar next year. Chris told us: \u201cWhen\nsomeone posted the poll on 4chan on\nSaturday, we took steps to limit the\npoll to logged-in users only.\n\u201cSadly we decided that their\nname choices weren\u2019t the best so we\ndiscounted them, however we have\ntheir IP addresses so we may see if we\ncan invite them down for the launch!\u201d\nThe bar will be named \u201cThe\nFoundry\u201d, which received 100 votes,\nfollowed closely by \u201cUrban Oak,\u201d that\nreceived 96.\nThe Union stated on its website:\n\u201cThe name is a great way to recognise\nthe history of the site where the new\nhall of residence stands. From the\nearly 1920s right up until the mid\n1980s the site was owned by Landi &\nGyrforming the site for their factory\nand offices.\n\u201cThe factory made \u201cElgee\u201d\nelectricity meters and time switches.\nSpecifically the Elgee factory, just\nlike Woodward Hall, was cut into the\nslope just west of Victoria Road.\n\u201cWe are really excited to bring\nyou this new bar and restaurant in\nconjunction with College Campus\nServices and look forward to it\nbeing an integral part of the student\nexperience for hall residents and\nstudents who live nearby!\u201d\nTrolling surveys by 4chan users\nis not new: a campaign run by\nMountain Dew back in 2012, called\n\u201cDub the Dew\u201d was hijacked.

Photo: Library of Congress\nKamil McClelland explores what inspires us to seek out adventure\n\"The\nproduct\nof a\nlifetime of\ndiscovery:\nmasks,\npottery,\ntrinkets\nfrom all\naround the\nworld.\"\n\u201cBut there is no such thing as a Silk\nRoad!\u201d\nI\ndidn\u2019t quite know how to react.\nWhat did she mean? Had my\ngrand plans of an adventure\nalong the ancient Silk Road\nthis summer all been in vain, chasing\nan imaginary past in the vast and\nstifling wastelands of Turkestan?\nI was giddy in anticipation of this\nlunchtime celebration I had been\ninvited to. It all started three years\nago when, in preparation for medical\nschool, I decided to volunteer with\na charity that sought to bring the\nelderly into the technological age\nby introducing them to computers\nand the basics of how to use them.\nAnd completely by chance, I was\npaired with the most remarkable\nwoman I had ever met; an 100-year\nold archaeologist with a lightning\nfast wit, we bonded over mint tea and\nhalwa, sharing our passion for travel,\nhistory and culture with tales of her\nwork in Helmand and Baluchistan\nin the late \u201840s. Photographs of rural\nlife - horse-drawn carts, minarets\nand naan sellers - told a story of a\ndifferent world, one that I knew no\nlonger existed but one that I still\nwanted to travel to. However, due to\nongoing instability in the region, I\nknew this would not be possible in\nthe foreseeable future. But a desire\nhad been ignited within me to visit a\nworld completely distinct from my\nown.\nAnd so when with my close friends\nI decided an adventure for our final\nlong summer was needed, straight\naway this thought of a new experience\novercame my mind. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be\nCentral Asia\u201d, I argued. The ultimate\nmelting pot of the world, it sat at\nthe crossroads of history\u2019s greatest\ncivilisations, absorbing influences\nfrom all its borders - China, Russia,\nthe Middle East - like a cultural\nsponge dripping with intrigue and\nconflict. And although the reality of\nthe area nowadays is more defined\nby its post-Soviet dictators, I knew it\nwould nevertheless be an expedition\nto reinvigorate the soul.\nMonths of planning later and with\nthe support of Imperial\u2019s Exploration\nBoard, I found myself at this party,\none to celebrate my archaeologist\nfriend\u2019s 101st\nat the home of an\nacademic colleague. An unassuming\nfacade on a quiet street in Clapham, I\ncould not have imagined the artistic\nhoard that lay inside, the product\nof a lifetime of excavations and\ndiscoveries; masks, pottery, trinkets\nfrom all around the world adorned\nthe walls, alive with all the dreams of\ntravel that glazed my eyes.\nfull of stories and helpful advice.\nNotably, they spoke warmly of\none city in particular - Bukhara.\nThough little known of in the West,\nthe descriptions painted for me of\nthis Silk Road city filled me with\nwonderment. Emerging from the\nunbroken desert, a single minaret\npierces upwards through the haze\nas if a vision. In the eyes of a weary\ntraveller, this phenomenal tower\nrepresents the end of a devastating\njourney across sun-parched\nnothingness.\nBuilt in mediaeval times alongside\nits more famous sister city of\nSamarkand, Bukhara is a place of\nfantasy. You could sit for days in the\nshade of the central square, watching\nas children jump from trees into\nthe tiled pond, trying to escape the\nmidday heat. From there, a short walk\nto the city\u2019s Old Town introduces you\nto the narrow warrens of its ancient\nJewish Quarter, a community that\nhas been all but wiped out in this\nstaunchly muslim nation. Only one\nsynagogue remains.\nI could not emerge from this\ndream: bustling markets stacked high\nwith porcelain teapots, the desolate,\nfeatureless Karakum (Black Sand)\nDesert, specked with the bivalve\nfossils of its aquatic past. However,\nthe reality of our undertaking was\nnever too far away - mid-summer,\nover 2300 miles of cycling through\nmostly desert. It was all too obvious as\nI carefully studied a map of our route.\nAnd so, although the reality of our\nexpedition may be far removed from\nmy dreams, perhaps as Mile 1000 of\nunrelenting desert heat chips away at\nmy soul or when our water supplies\nrun low, hallucinations of plentiful\noasis towns, ethereal domed mosques,\nwill beckon me onwards, just as it\ndid the Bactrian caravans centuries\nbefore me.\nFollow our expedition at www.\ntourdestan.co.uk or on Facebook at\nCycling the Silk Road 2015\n\"A single\nminaret\npierces\nupwards\nthrough\nthe haze as\nif a vision.\"\n\u201cWhat do you mean it doesn\u2019t\nexist?\u201d, I questioned anxiously. The\noriginal statement was in fact more\na clarification of the term \u2018Silk\nRoad\u2019 than an outright rejection\nof its existence. For it was not\nsimply one road but a term coined\nin the West for the mesh of trade\nroutes extending all the way from\nthe Middle East to central China.\nAs certain routes declined due to\nwarfare or even high taxes, others\nboomed, a constant ebb and flow that\ncarried with it not only goods but\nknowledge and religion. Moreover,\nit is a misnomer that it was merely\na \u2018Silk\u2019 road or that commerce was\nunidirectional. Teas and spices\nand a panoply of other wares were\nalso traded, in both directions, for\ncenturies before improved maritime\ntrade routes brought about the route\u2019s\ndemise.\nMy hosts, an archaeologist and an\nart historian, had travelled to the\nregion many times and thus were\n\n"

Fewer still can say they have\nre-hung an art museum and worked\nas Heathrow airport\u2019s first ever\nwriter-in-residence \u2013 but the author,\ndocumentary maker, and popular\nphilosopher Alain de Botton can\nclaim all of these achievements.\nAlain has spent his working\nlife writing, talking and making\ndocumentaries about the \u201cphilosophy\nof the everyday.\u201d The topics covered\nin his twelve published books include:\nart, success, travel, architecture,\nwork, the news, pessimism, atheism,\nsex, love, philosophy, literature, and\nmany others besides. In fact, it might\nbe quicker simply to list the topics\nAlain has not written about.\nThe Swiss-born public intellectual\nmoved to England to board at Harrow\nSchool before going up to Cambridge\nUniversity, where he received a\ndouble starred first in History. Alain\ncontinued his academic career at\nKing\u2019s College London with a Masters\nin Philosophy and started working\non a PhD in French Philosophy at\nHarvard University, before dropping\nout to write for the general public.\nAged just 23, Alain\u2019s book Essays In\nLove was published to critical acclaim,\nand has sold over two million copies\nworldwide.\nIn 2008, Alain co-founded The\nSchool of Life \u2013 an organisation that\nis dedicated to \u201cdeveloping emotional\nintelligence through the help of\nculture.\u201d Alain authors and narrates\nmany of the films on The School of\nLife\u2019s YouTube channel, covering\ntopics ranging from \u201cthe philosophy\nof oral sex\u201d and \u201cthe meaning of\nlife\u201d to profiles on many of the\ngreat philosophers and writers from\nhistory.\nI got in touch with Alain to talk\nabout the ideas running through his\nwork.\nJoshua Renken: How did the School\nof Life come to fruition, and what are\nthe problems it is trying to address?\nAlain de Botton: The School of\nLife was started by me and some\ncolleagues in 2008. The mission is to\ntry to raise emotional intelligence,\nlooking at key issues in emotional life\nthrough the prism of the humanities\n(philosophy, psychology, literature,\nhistory and so on). We believe in\nthe attempt to transmit wisdom\naround some of what people find\ntrickiest in life; knowing how to form\nrelationships, living with others,\nfacing death, finding a job that is\nsatisfying and right for one\u2019s talents\netc.\nJR: What key lessons can atheists\nlearn from organised religion?\nAB: Religion was never simply about\nsuperstition and belief. It\u2019s also been\nabout an attempt to instil an ethical\ncode, to bring comfort, to nourish a\nfeeling of community, and to ritualise\nkey moments of existence. Religion\nhasn\u2019t always done well in these\nareas (I am an atheist myself), but I\nbelieve that atheists can learn about\nthe emotional needs that once drove\npeople to religion and should look for\nways to satiate those needs outside a\nstructure of \u2018belief\u2019.\nJR: Do you envision a large humanist\nmovement in the future that employs\nthe tools of communication used\nby religions, while the organised\nreligions of today fizzle out? Is this\nAtheism 2.0?\nAB: Yes, eventually religion will\nsimply become implausible, but the\nneeds that led humans to make up\nreligion will go on. So the challenge\nfor a secular society like ours is to\ncome with replacements for many of\nthe activities and attitudes once put\nforward by religions.\nJR: What do you think is more likely:\na God or many Gods?\nAB: Both seem utterly implausible to\nme, sadly.\nJR: What was your ambition when\nyou and The School of Life had\nthe opportunity to re-hang the\nRijksmuseum of Art in Amsterdam?\nWas it a success?\nAB: The idea was to promote a very\ninstrumental way of looking at art. It\nhas been deeply fashionable for 150\nyears to claim that art has no purpose\noutside of itself, that it is just \u2018art for\nart\u2019s sake.\u2019\nThis began as a respectable attempt\nto free art from the agendas of the\nstate and religions; but it has ended us\nup with narcissism of the worst kind.\nThe best art has always been\ninterested in helping its viewers with\nthe great issues of life: how to greet\ndeath, find contentment, appreciate\nexistence, celebrate what is good,\ncondemn was seems wicked. The\nAmsterdam show put this aspect of\nart center stage.\nIt outraged many art critics (as\nit was meant to; they outrage me\nwith their attitudes!) but it was an\nenormous popular success, drawing in\nhundreds of thousands of visitors to\nthe museum and our website.\nJR: What, in your view, is the purpose\nof art?\nAB: The task of art is to console, to\nrebalance, to awaken, to sensitise, to\nquestion and to redeem. Art is deeply\nfunctional, just like a stapler or a\nspade.\nJR: How can a pessimistic outlook\nlead to a happier life? Is the secret to\nhappiness simply low expectations?\nAB: Commercial society is unbearably\njolly \u2013 and technology leads us to\nimagine that a better future is always\naround the corner. Because most\nof us will live to see most our hopes\ndashed, it definitely pays to have a\ndeep reserve of pessimism to hand.\nNot least, it is a great for developing\na sense of humour. The gap between\nwhat we want the world to be and\nwhat it is should be filled with\nlaughter.\nAlain de Botton talking at a TEDx Conference in Oxford. Photo: FT\nJR: What do you mean when you say\nthe \u201carchitecture of news has broken\ndown\u201d in the media?\nAB: One of the worst things about the\nUK is its media, which is alternately\ncomplacent, provincial, and plain\nuselessly nasty.\nThe task of the media is to help a\nnation to understand itself better,\nto gain a clearer insight into its\nproblems, and to move forwards with\nunderstanding and wisdom. All this is\nmissing, whether from The Guardian\nor The Sun or the BBC.\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise us,\nwe\u2019re still at the dawn of the age\nof news and are still working out\nhow to structure and arrange the\ninformation we need.\nJR: During research for your book The\nPleasures and Sorrows of Work, what\ncriteria did you find needed to be met\nfor a fulfilling job?\nAB: Fulfilment in work essentially\n\"We believe\nin the\nattempt to\ntransmit\nwisdom\naround\nsome\nof what\npeople find\ntrickiest in\nlife.\"\n\u201cReligion\nwill simply\nbecome\nimplausible,\nbut the\nneeds that\nled humans\nto make up\nreligion will\ngo on.\u201d\n\"I realised\nthat\nacademic\nlife was\nalways\ngoing to\nrestrict me.\"\n\u201cAs a\nwriter...the\nbest advice\nis to think\nnot of what\npeople\nmight be\nsaying\nright now,\nbut of how\nthings\n[may] look\na few years\nfrom now.\u201d\ncomes from service, from helping\nothers in accordance with one\u2019s best\ncapacities \u2013 and being moderately\nwell recognised for having done so.\nThis sounds simple but is\nimmensely hard, only a few of us\nare properly happy in our work,\nperhaps less than 10% of the working\npopulation.\nJR: How would you change the way\ndegree courses in the humanities are\ntaught? Particularly in history and\nphilosophy.\nAB: I would dissolve away these\narchaic subject categories and teach\nunder new categories like: Death,\nFriendship, Love, Community,\nForgiveness etc.\nUnder such headings you\u2019d find out\na lot about history and philosophy,\nbut not under those absurd academic\nheadings like \u2018The 19th\ncentury novel\u2019\nor \u2018Neoclassicism\u2019, titles dreamt up\nby, and only of interest to, scholars.\nJR: In your book How To Think More\nAbout Sex, you touch on the subject of\npornography. Do you think society\u2019s\ngeneral disapproval of pornography\nis healthy, and are you in favour of\nlegalising prostitution?\nAB: The point isn\u2019t to ban\npornography or approve of all of it,\nbut rather to see whether we might\nget a better kind of porn, which really\nmeans a porn that\u2019s more connected\nto values esteemed in other areas of\nlife: dignity, respect, intelligence.\nJR: Are you concerned that future\ngenerations will no longer have the\nattention span required to study great\nworks of philosophy and literature?\nAB: Many great works are very\nboring and anything writers can do to\nmake their work slightly pacier and\nmore direct should be welcomed. Let\u2019s\nstop always blaming the reader. Some\nof the great masterpieces desperately\nneed an edit.\nJR: Should I feel a bit guilty that I\nfind philosophy hard to read and\noccasionally even a little dull?\nAB: No, it\u2019s the fault of philosophers.\nHegel is a great philosopher but he is\na properly disastrous writer.\nJR: Which books have made the\nbiggest impact on your life?\nAB: Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time,\nwhich taught me that a novel can be\nphilosophical.\nJR: Why did you decide to stop\npursuing your PhD at Harvard?\nAB: I realised that academic life was\nalways going to restrict me: I realised\nthat my real vocation was to speak\nto other non-experts like me, not a\nnarrow coterie of specialists.\nJR: Do you ever read the reviews that\ncome out of your books, and if so, do\nyou find it easy to ignore \u2018the haters\u2019\nwhen presenting a new theory to the\npublic?\nAB: I read all my reviews and have\nlearnt a lot about life and myself in\nthe process.\nAs a writer, to keep calm, the best\nadvice is to think not of what people\nmight be saying right now, but of how\nthings might settle down and look a\nfew years from now.\nJR: How would you describe your\nown political views?\nAB: I believe in high quality\npublic environments, great media,\nintelligent school curriculums, a\nsmall state, very generous welfare\n\u2013 and extremely careful urban\nplanning.\nAlain\u2019s latest book The News: A User\u2019s\nManual went on sale earlier last year.\nYou can find more information about\nAlain at www.alaindebotton.com.\n\u201cThe gap\nbetween\nwhat we\nwant the\nworld to be\nand what it\nis should be\nfilled with\nlaughter.\u201d\n\n"

Are you\nfeeling forced to embark on a career\nthat will force you to work 17 hour\ndays for an uncaring capitalist? This\nis what George Monbiot and John\nSheil have said in The Guardian\nand London Student recently. They\nsay that students need protecting\nfrom the influence of recruiters\nusing \u201clovebombing of the kind\nthat cults use\u201d and that universities\u2019\ncareers services are perpetuating the\nproblem. I guess we must be doomed\nto a life of slaving away for a greedy\ncorporate master.\nThis is patronising and\nmisleading. If students from\n\u201cleading universities\u201d are these\ngreat intellectual people that they\nthink we are, then we are perfectly\ncapable of making rational and\ninformed decisions about the career\nwe take up. What Monbiot and\nSheil fail to understand is that some\npeople genuinely want to work in\n\u201cFinance, management consultancy,\nadvertising, public relations [and]\nlobbying\u201d \u2013 all jobs that Monbiot\ndecries as \u201cuseless occupations\u201d. I\nhate to break it to The Guardian, but\nthose are all jobs that our economy\ndepends upon. Admittedly it\u2019d be nice\nif finance was regulated effectively\nso that it didn\u2019t blow up the economy\nevery couple of decades, but these are\nall industries that generate revenue\nfor the treasury that fund public\nservices we all use. Perhaps he\u2019d\nprefer it if we all got jobs that allow us\nto, \u201cseek enlightenment, intellectual\nor spiritual; to do good; to love and be\nloved; to create and to teach\u201d which\npresumably is what his Guardian\ncolumn is designed to do, but sadly\nsomeone needs to be an accountant\nas well.\nIn another article, Monbiot quotes\na \u201cBarclays analyst\u201d who said, \u201cWe\nexpect you to be the last ones to\nleave every night, no matter what \u2026 I\nrecommend bringing a pillow to the\noffice \u2013 it makes sleeping under your\ndesk a lot more comfortable\u201d. What\nhe doesn\u2019t mention is that this was\na satirical email which also said to\n\u201chave a tie/scarf around, you\u2019ll never\nknow when your associate needs a\nhandkerchief\u201d. There are concerns at\nsome banks that their interns work\ntoo many hours in an attempt to\nimpress, but increasingly this is being\naddressed by companies who want\nhealthy employees. There will always\nbe those who are very ambitious in\nthe industries that pay the best, and\nfor the salaries you get paid in the\nfinancial sector, you expect to work\nlong hours. This is fine if you love the\njob, which some people genuinely do.\nI\u2019m just a humble engineer. I\u2019m\ngoing to be designing medical devices\nwhen I graduate; it sounds very moral\nand enlightened, but think about it\ntoo hard and I\u2019m basically making\na profit from others\u2019 illnesses. Not\nso great now, is it? Taking a moral\nposition on someone\u2019s employment\nchoice is impossible to do. Is the\ncreative writer or artist a better\nperson than the accountant or\nbusinessman? Many would tell you\nso, but they are ignorant of the work\nthese people do and how important\nit is to the economy we all live in.\nIt\u2019s easy for someone who is talented\nenough at writing to be printed in a\nnational newspaper to take a swipe at\npeople who work in less glamorous\nindustries, but without the support\nof these big corporations, newspapers\nlike The Guardian couldn\u2019t exist.\nAt the same time, of course we\nwant creative people. We want some\npeople to shun The City, work for\ncharities, invent things, entertain us\nand make life worth living. But these\npeople shouldn\u2019t be snobby about\nthose who don\u2019t chose this path. A\nsociety of artists and intellectuals is as\ndystopian as a society of bankers and\nadvertisers. It just wouldn\u2019t work.\nMonbiot and Sheil don\u2019t\njust criticise students\u2019 choices\nthough; their biggest targets are\nthe universities who should be\n\u201cprotecting\u201d us. Sheil says that\ncareers departments \u201cwere either so\nintellectually moribund that they\nhad not contemplated the question of\nthe general purpose of a university\u201d.\nI don\u2019t want my careers department\nto be full of intellectuals who start\nHere to help or to tell us everything?

I\u2019m Grace, current\nmusic editor, and next year\u2019s\neditor-in-chief. Or as I\u2019m\nrenaming the position, Philippa-inchief. I don\u2019t want to get too soppy in\nthis, the last issue of Skett\u2019s tenure but\nI can\u2019t fight it. Our output has been\nastonishing this year, if we do say so\nourselves.\nAs is usual, the news has been\nunpredictable, but Philippa\nand the whole team have dealt\nwith everything in the classiest\nway possible, with the utmost\nprofessionalism (vom). The sleepless\nnights she spends in our subterranean\nlair, working on the latest issue,\nhopefully don\u2019t go unnoticed by\nyou, the student body, and I hope\nwe\u2019ve served your need for unbiased,\nImperial-focussed news and\namusement.\nAfter the summer, I\u2019m hoping that\nwe\u2019ll have a shiny new website for\nyour consumption, more photos to go\nwith our stories, and more stuff that\nyou want to read. So if you can help\nwith any of that, or just fancy coming\nto the socials, don\u2019t hesitate to get in\ntouch next year (or now, I have a lot of\nfree time). This time last year I\u2019d only\nwritten one shoddy article for the\npaper and look at me now! Writing an\neditorial the night before publication,\nI am truly a member of Felix. I wish\nI\u2019d done it sooner.\nI only really started getting\ninvolved with the paper this year\nand became music editor on a bit of\na whim. The fact that six months in\nI felt able to run for editorship is a\ncredit to the friendliness and support\nof the team. Yes I ran unopposed, but\nI\u2019d like to invite the 300 or so people\nwho RON\u2019d me to get in touch; I want\nto buy you a soda lime and ask what\nI can do to reassure you. Thanks for\nvoting for me in though chums; I\ngenuinely never dreamt that little ol\u2019\nme would be allowed to make you a\npaper, and I am so incredibly grateful.\nAs the production team turn up\nthe music, to politely hint that I\nshould finish this speech, I just want\nto reiterate the openness of Felix. If\nyou\u2019re a club, an illustrator, writer,\nphotographer, reader or speaker of\nwords, or a human person, come and\nsay hello to us in the office in the\nwest basement at Beit. It\u2019s clearly\nsignposted but if you get lost or that\nseems too informal, you can send an\ne-mail to the Felix account advertised\nmultiple times in this issue and share\nyour thoughts, gripes or ideas for\nnext year. I want to hear from you!\nProfessionally, but also because a lot\nof my friends are leaving. Trag.\nquestioning me about the true\nmeaning of a higher education, I just\nwant my CV to be checked over and to\nbe given some interview advice. Their\njob is to help with \u201ccareers\u201d. If I want\nan intellectual discussion, I am happy\nto, and am capable of going elsewhere.\nWe do need to make informed\ndecisions about our life, and\nadmittedly if you go to a careers\nfair you can leave with the\nimpression that all there is to do is\nto be a consultant or banker. This\nis not the case, but you need to take\nresponsibility yourself for exploring\nthe world you live in. It\u2019s unfair to\nexpect a careers service to present\nevery possible \u201ccareer path\u201d, you have\nto look for it yourself. In London\nwe\u2019re fortunate to have access to a\nhuge wealth of industries. Other\nuniversities look on with jealousy at\nthe access and proximity we have to\nemployers in all types of industries.\nGo out there and find them yourself \u2013\nyou don\u2019t need me to tell you that.\nI have something to admit: Last\nyear I had doubts that the then\nDeputy President (Welfare) elect\nwould do a good job,and I even\nwrote an article for Felix about it.I\nworried that he would not take his\nrole seriously,and that his dislike\nof bureaucracy would get in the\nway of working as an effective\nsabbatical officer.\nRegular readers of Felix will\nknow Chris as Kris Kraye,a\nfictionalised character devised by\nour editor,but the real Chris Kaye\nhas exceeded all expectations,\ndoing great work throughout\nthe year to really make a\ndifference for students.Who\ncan forget his work on feminine\nhygiene products,ensuring their\navailability at reasonable prices\nfree of VAT; or his room-swap\nscheme,through which students\nin halls can change rooms\nensuring they have affordable,\ncomfortable accommodation with\ngood company?\nChris has worked constructively\nto deliver sensible,practical\nchanges.He has not fallen into the\ntrap of spending too much time\non grandiose ambitions (single-handedly eliminating tuition fees,\nfor example),and has identified\nissues that he can and has been\nable to do something about,\nreducing stress and anxiety and\nhelping improve the welfare of\nstudents.I am hopeful that he will\ncontinue this next year as DP(FS).\nNICK FARMER\nCOMMENT WRITER\n\"This time\nlast year\nI\u2019d only\nwritten\none shoddy\narticle for\nthe paper\nand look at\nme now!\"\n\"I want to\nbuy you a\nsoda lime\nand ask\nwhat I\ncan do to\nreassure\nyou.\"\nHe\u2019s OKaye\nreally\nThis year has been a really exciting\ntime to be Comment editor.We\nhave,as always,had some articles\nthat have been written with\npurely contrary opinions,almost\ncertainly written with the sole\npurpose of drawing a response,\nbut for the most part,I\u2019m so proud\nthat most of the articles I\u2019ve put in\nFelix this year are from people who\nhonestly want to put it out there\nthat something is wrong,with no\naim other than to educate people\nabout it,to start a discussion,or to\nchange people\u2019s minds.As Angry\nGeek wrote in his wonderful\ncomeback (honestly,I can die\nhappy now),the Comment section\nis hearteningly full of good people\nwriting about important issues.\nI\u2019m really excited to work with\nGrace next year.Both editors-in-chief I\u2019ve worked with so far have\nbeen amazing,and have had\ndifferent approaches towards\nthe controversial articles that\nsometimes land in my inbox.It\u2019s\neasy to just not print articles that\nare a bit too contentious,but the\npoint of an opinion section is to\npush the boundaries,and with\nthe help of the esteemed editors-in-chief,we aim to bring you as\nmany opinions as we can without\ngetting sued.\nThis is the end of my second year\nas Comment editor,and I hope\nI\u2019ve done you proud in finding\narticles for you to read every week.\nI\u2019ll still be here in next Autumn\nterm,ready to do it all again,but\nwe need new writers and editors\nas well.Please,if you want to help,\nor if you think you can do a better\njob,get in touch.We\u2019re always\nhappy to hear from you!\nTESSA DAVEY\nCOMMENT EDITOR\nAww shucks,\nI\u2019m so proud of\ny\u2019all\nHear her meow.
