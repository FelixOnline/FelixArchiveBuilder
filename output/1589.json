    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n21.11.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTen days ago, controversial\ninternet sensation Daniel\nO\u2019Reilly appeared on an\nexclusive Newsnight interview to\nannounce the retirement of his\ncomedic persona, Dapper Laughs.\nFor connoisseurs of quality humour\nthe nation over, it is a welcome end\nto what has been a meteoric rise of\ninternet stardom characterised by\na litany of increasingly poor taste,\nmisogynistic diatribe, culminating\nin O\u2019Reilly telling a woman that she\nwas \u201cgagging for a rape\u201d at a stand\nup show. Why exactly anyone would\nbe \u201cgagging\u201d to be raped is anyone\u2019s\nguess. Rape is hardly a trivial matter;\nit leaves physical and mental scars\nthat may never fully fade, if they\nfade at all. It destroys people\u2019s lives,\nminds, bodies and relationships. He\nmay as well have accused the woman\nof \u201cgagging to have her legs blown off\nby an IED\u201d.\nOf course the resultant media\nfurore was rightly targeted at\nDapper Laughs himself. I will not\nrepeat the many complaints against\nhis puerile antics here; they have\nbeen articulated hundreds of times\nbefore in editorials, social media,\nthe blogosphere, or any other forum\nfor public opinion one can think of.\nThey are misguided, however: Dapper\nLaughs is simply a manifestation of\na wider illness in our culture, and it\nis this illness which will need to be\naddressed if any meaningful progress\nis to be made.\nConsider for a moment that Dapper\nLaughs\u2019 particular brand of juvenile\nsexual spivery and vulgar attitudes\ntowards rape (\u201cIf you whip your dick\nout and she starts crying, she\u2019s just\nplaying hard to get\u201d) can be viewed\na commodity, subject to the same\nlaws of supply and demand as wheat,\ngold, or timber. If the demand exists,\nthen someone sooner or later will\nsupply. If there is no demand, then\nthere is no incentive to supply. That\nthis article is even being written is an\nindication that Dapper Laughs was\nable to fill a niche that is very much\nin demand. The pertinent question\nwould therefore be: why does this\ndemand exist in the first place?\nThere is a far deeper issue here than\njust Dapper Laughs. That he exists\nat all is the result of a pervading\nclimate of indifference regarding\nrape and violence towards women. It\nis the same attitude that allowed the\nfootballer and convicted rapist, Ched\nEvans, to resume training with his old\nclub, Sheffield United, after serving\nonly half of a five year sentence. That\nEvans was tried, and found guilty\n\u2013 beyond all reasonable doubt \u2013 of\nforcing himself upon a nineteen\nyear old girl is seemingly immaterial\nin the eyes of the club; he resumed\ntraining as straightforwardly as if he\nhad just recovered from an injury.\nWhat we are fundamentally saying\nwhen we allow these things to happen\nis that it\u2019s okay for our celebrities and\nour sportsmen \u2013 our role models \u2013 to\nperpetrate violence towards women\nbecause they will release clemency\nfrom society in return.\nUltimately, it is good and right to go\nafter Dapper Laughs and Ched Evans;\nthey are both deserving of criticism.\nHowever, they will be replaced by\nothers in the not too distant future if\nthe underlying issues in our society\nare not addressed. After all, as any\ndoctor would advise: don\u2019t treat the\nsymptoms, treat the disease.\nThe retirement of Dapper Laughs\nWhat are prices? Who\ndecides prices? Walking\ndown a supermarket aisle,\nwe see a wide variety of complicated\npricing schemes; buy one get one free,\nhalf price, special offers and the like.\nThese prices seem either carefully\ncalculated \u2013 what makes them so\nspecific?\nMost people think of a price in\nterms of how much goods are worth.\nHowever, this assertion misses a\ndistinction between \u2018price\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019.\nThe price that a company charges for\na good or service is influenced by a\nwide variety of factors; for example,\ncompetition in a town grocer\u2019s\nmarket can decrease the price of\nvegetables as competitors undercut\neach other.\nIn economics, price is often defined\nas the intersection of supply and\ndemand. This means that companies\nwill set their price when it \u2018clears\nthe market\u2019 and the exact amount\nof goods that they produce will be\nbought by consumers. There is no\nexcess demand or supply at this price.\nHowever, economic models do not\noften match reality. Sometimes prices\nare determined by market structure,\nthe larger economic situation or even\nbusiness objectives.\nOn a recent trip to Carphone\nWarehouse, I was looking at cases for\nthe new iPhone 6, when I noticed that\nall the cheapest models were priced\nbetween \u00a312.99 and \u00a314.99. The cases\nare injection-moulded and I would\nguess cost less than 50p to make. This\nprofit margin seems extortionate.\nHow can Carphone Warehouse get\naway with such prices, and why are\nconsumers willing to pay so much?\nOne possible answer could be the\npsychology of the market. iPhones\nare expensive, and people are willing\nto spend more on a case to protect\ntheir phone: the higher the price, the\nhigher the perceived value of the case.\nPeople feel that buying a cheap case\nwill be a poor investment, and will\nnot protect their phone in the long\nrun.\nThis factor might make this\nproduct a \u2018Giffen good\u2019. This is when a\ngood goes against market convention\nand the quantity demanded of the\ngood increases rather than decreases\nwhen the price is increased.\nAnother answer is that the cases\nhave an inelastic price. This means\nthat a large change in price will\nonly cause a small drop in quantity\ndemanded. Since the demand for\nthe iPhone case is \u2018derived\u2019 from\nthe demand for the iPhone, even if\nthe iPhone case is very expensive,\nthe demand for the cases will not\nchange much, as long as people still\nbuy iPhones. This is true as long as\nthe price of the case is relatively low\ncompared that of the phone.\nAn additional answer might be that\nthe different manufacturers of cases\nare colluding to keep to the same\nhigh price. If collusion is proven in a\nmarket, although this is very difficult,\nthis can lead to legal battles. Perhaps\nthe price is high due to the overheads\nof the machines that produce the\ncases. Whatever the reason, iPhone\ncases are a classic example of market\nimperfection.\nSAMUEL BODANSKY\nCOMMENT WRITER\nWhat drives what we pay for things?\nNathaniel Gallop on the underlying issues that encourage media misogyny\n\"How can\nCarphone\nWarehouse\nget away\nwith such\nprices, and\nwhy are\nconsumers\nwilling\nto pay so\nmuch?\"\n\"...misses a\ndistinction\nbetween\n'price' and\n'value'.\"\nPhoto: twimg\n\n"

These were:\n- We accidently split the puzzles\npages. We apologise to our Puzzles\nEditor and any confusion caused.\nAfter having all the\nhoroscopes written about\nme by my lovely team,\nthis week I was planning to write my\neditorial being all sassy about them\ntoo. However, looking back through\nthis issue, the content is pretty\nimpressive, so I am going to let them\noff the hook.\nOur science section is taking centre\nstage, with James\u2019 interview with\nChris Carr, a scientist behind the\nRosetta team. Everyone has been\ntalking about the mission that put a\nrobot on a flying comet (for lots of\ndifferent reasons, granted) but the\nfact that one of the many people that\nmade it happen is one of Imperial\u2019s\nown is impressive. The fact that we\nhave his story within our pages this\nissue is even cooler.\nWe have a bumper Arts section\n(as usual), and this week it is the\nGaze issue. The Arts team is looking\nat, well, how we look at things.\nThey address, with rather sticking\nserendipity, misogyny and how it is\ndressed as \u2018art.\u2019 I love Arts.\nWe then address That Shirt in\nComment, and again we return back\nto thinly-veiled misogyny. Or is it?\nThe debate can hardly be summed\nup in one page and through two\ncomment pieces, but our Comment\nsection gives it a pretty decent try.\nThe other Big Debate of the week\nhas been BandAid 30, which Grace\ncovers in Music and then Tessa, our\nComment editor, discusses and picks\napart. We love a good argument, and\nthe office has been truly divided this\nweek over whether or not Bob Geldolf\nis well-meaning or simply loves a\ngood Christmas number one.\nNews spans from inside the\nImperial bubble to outside of London:\nwe readdress the bursary changes and\nlook to see if students are getting a\ngood deal (turns out they are) and we\nalso review the new halls in Acton\n(turns out they\u2019re not too bad either,\nconsidering they are still miles away).\nConsultation is still the debate that\nweaves through news though: just\nhow much of a say should students\nhave?\nOutside of the controversy bubble,\nin Film this week we have amazing\nreviews of Mockingjay and The\nImitation Game, two big films to hit\nthe screens recently. Props to our\nFilm Section Editor Jack Steadman\nwho went to a midnight screening of\nMockingjay then stayed up all night\nwriting the review.\nWe continue on our series on\nMental Health in Welfare, and\nin Travel we stay closer to home,\nreviewing the Somerset House ice\nRink. We end our issue with yet\nanother debate, over the introduction\nof double points in Formula One\nracing.\nWe would like to thank our\n\u201cofficial\u201d sponsors for the week,\nTaylor Swift and Yankee candles.\nUnlike our section editors, we love\nBlank Space and apparently we\ncannot stop sniffing the Christmas\nMemories candle we have bouncing\naround the office.\nWe also love our new member of\nthe Felix team, our Wall Mounted\nTV. Shout-out to the Union Overlord\nfor his endless benevolence and\ngranting us our wish for a screen\nto play Taylor Swift on repeatedly\n(I mean, to watch website stats and\ndiscuss layout designs on).\nI hope you enjoy this week\u2019s issue as\nmuch as we enjoyed making it.

Photo: Band Aid Trust / Brian Anis / Camera Press\nGrace Rahman rounds up the controversy surrounding Sir Bob\u2019s latest offering\n\"Geldof\nremarked\nthat the\nperformance\non X Factor\nmeant it\nhad made\n\u00a31 million\nbefore it\nwent on sale\"\n\"Morrisey\nonce called\nthe original\n'daily torture\non the people\nof England'.\"\nThe first radio play of the\nrejuvenated Band Aid single,\nDo They Know It\u2019s Christmas?,\nhappened this week, following a\nfirst look at the music video on\nlast Saturday\u2019s X Factor. This is the\nfourth time in thirty years that the\ncharity song has been recorded, but\nthe first time the lyrics have been\nchanged. Bono\u2019s controversial line\n\u2018Well tonight thank God it\u2019s them,\ninstead of you\u2019 has been replaced with\n\u2018Well tonight we\u2019re reaching out and\ntouching you\u2019.\nStars like 1D, Ellie Goulding, Jessie\nWare and Ed Sheeran gathered\nat Sarm Studios to record the\ntrack on Friday, which coincided\nwith chancellor George Osborne\nannouncing that the UK government\nwould wave the VAT on purchases\nof the single. The downloadable\nversion was released on Monday,\nwith a hard copy coming out on 8th\nDecember. The singles, with cover art\nby Tracy Emin, will cost 99p and \u00a34\nrespectively.\nBob Geldof, who just finished a UK\ntour with old band The Boomtown\nRats announced the relaunch of Band\nAid last Monday saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like\ndoing this stuff, it\u2019s quite embarassing\ncalling people you don\u2019t know\u201d. Ebola\nhas already claimed the lives of over\n5000 people since March.\nOf course, and perhaps not to its\ndetriment, the campaign hasn\u2019t been\nwithout its controversy. Despite being\nnamed as collaborators in Geldof\u2019s\ninitial press release, Foals, Fuse ODG\nand perhaps most notably, Adele, are\nnot in the final recording. It has now\nemerged that this conference was\ngiven before the involvement of these\nartists had been finalised.\nNME reports that Foals weren\u2019t\nable to attend due to recording\ncommitments. Fuse ODG pulled\nout on Saturday morning, telling Sir\nBob that he felt \u2018awkward\u2019 about the\nnew lyrics, tweeting that he felt \u201cthe\nmessage \u2026 was not in line with the\nThis Is New Africa movement\u201d.\nThe day after recording, The Sun\nreported that Adele had \u201csnubbed\u201d\nthe charity single and that Bob Geldof\nhad called her \u201chundreds of times\u201d.\nThis was later denied by Adele\u2019s\npeople, who said she had made a\nsizable donation to Oxfam. In a pre-watershed interview with Sky News on\nMonday that got cut short due to his\nrepeated swearing, Sir Bob qualified\nher absence by saying that Adele was\ndoing nothing in the public eye at the\nmoment. \u201cShe\u2019s bringing up a family\nyou know,\u201d he said.\nSo how well is it going to do?\nThe original, in 1984, raised about\n\u00a38 million for aid efforts during\nthe Ethiopian famine. It also sold\n200,000 copies in two days. By\nTuesday, Band Aid 30\u2019s single had\nalready sold around 206,000 copies,\nmaking it the fastest selling single\nof 2014. The chief executive of the\nOfficial Charts Company called\nits first day\u2019s performance \u201ctruly\nexceptional\u201d, and it\u2019s expected to\ngo straight in at number one on\nSunday. But how much will it make?\nIn an interview with Radio 4 on\nMonday, Geldof remarked that the\nperformance on X Factor meant it had\nmade \u00a31 million before it went on\nsale, presumably from pre-ordering.\nWhile Bob and the gang are busy\npromoting, several people have\nspoken out against the idea of\nanother charity single \u2018for Africa\u2019.\nDamon Albarn, formerly of Blur, told\njournalists before his performance\nat the RAH last week, that Band Aid\n30 was perpetuating a patronising\nWestern stereotype that the whole\ncontinent is in need.\nIn his Sky News interview, Geldof\u2019s\nswearing was in reaction to a question\nabout the tax status of some of his\nparticipants. The project\u2019s line-up,\ntiming, necessity, old and new lyrics\nhave been criticised by all parts of the\npress spectrum. Morrisey once called\nthe original \u201cdaily torture on the\npeople of England\u201d. Sir Bob doesn\u2019t\nseem to care though. Harking back to\nhis infamous line in 1984, that people\nshould \u201cgive us your fucking money\u201d,\nhe told fans this week, \u201cit really\ndoesn\u2019t matter if you hate this song or\nyou don\u2019t like this song, you have to\nbuy this thing\u201d.\n\n"

Groups\nlike the European Space Agency (ESA)\nknow there is little justification for\ntheir huge budgets if they just keep\nthe action to themselves. Rockets\nare cool and if you can get the public\nexcited about what you\u2019re doing then\nyou can fund more science. Not only\nthat, but you can use these projects\nto excite the next generation of\nscientists and engineers and get more\nkids choosing to study these subjects.\nAs public bodies this should be,\nand is, one of their key goals. Last\nweek any science teacher worth their\nsalt would have had the web stream\nof the Rosetta mission on in their\nclassroom. They would have built\ndiscussions and lessons around it:\nwhat\u2019s the point of the mission?\nWhat\u2019s a comet? How did they get\nthere? Isn\u2019t science awesome?\nBut then as the nation\u2019s physics\nteachers tuned in or watched\nYouTube interviews, we had\nShirtgate. Viewers couldn\u2019t help but\nnotice that one of the scientists\u2019 shirts\nwas covered in semi-naked women.\nHow does that make girls in that\nscience class feel? That they could\nhave a future doing similar work?\nThat science is for them? That it\u2019s not\njust a bunch of male geeks?\nThere has rightly been a huge\namount of effort to get more girls\nchoosing to study STEM subjects,\nGEORGE BUTCHER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nAccording to a recent parliamentary\nreport, just 17% of STEM professors\nare women. If you\u2019re a woman in\nscience and technology, at some point\nyou\u2019ll probably be asked to do some\noutreach work. I\u2019m a straight, white\nman and I have!\nAs a community we\u2019re missing\nout on the contribution that these\nwomen could be making and that\u2019s\na detriment to us all. Projects like\nthe comet landing are supposed to\nbe reversing this, but sadly scientists\nkeep shooting themselves in the foot\nwith these stupid mistakes.\nLet\u2019s all learn from this and move\non.\nThose following \u2018Shirtgate\u2019 may\nhave seen this image being\nshared on Reddit and Twitter. The Mayor of London certainly\nhas, as this week he incorporated its\nidiotic message into a piece for the\nTelegraph, joining the keyboard warriors who have defeated feminism,\nshowing it to be a mess of double\nstandards and hypocrisy.\nTo recap: Imperial alumnus Dr\nMatt Taylor wore a shirt covered in\nscantily-clad women while discussing\nthe Rosetta mission on television.\nAfter a torrent of abuse on Twitter, he\nhas made a heartfelt apology. Clearly,\nDr Taylor is no frothing misogynist\n\u2013 he just made the mistake of wearing\na shirt that was not appropriate for\ntelevision, and arguably not appropriate for work.\nMy beef is not with him, but his\ndefenders \u2013 at least, those who believe\nthere\u2019s a hypocrisy in deriding his\nshirt choice while at the same time\nbeing okay with Kim KardashianWest getting naked for Paper. Boris\nJohnson goes further, and asks if\nfeminists are \u201ca bunch of Islamist\nmaniacs who think any representation of the human form is an offence\nagainst God\u201d and wonders if we want\nto tear down all sexual imagery from\nmuseums.\nBeing Mayor of London is hard, I\nknow. Still, a couple of examples from\nBoris\u2019s career could help him understand this situation. Let\u2019s review:\n\u201cKim gets naked and everyone loves\nher for it. Why don\u2019t I do it when\nopening new free schools?\u201d he asks.\nBecause there\u2019s a time and a place for\nsexual imagery, Boris, and it\u2019s not\nwhen making important announcements about completely unrelated\nthings.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like people brandishing\nknives on the streets,\u201d he says, \u201cbut\nit\u2019s okay when Jamie Oliver does it\non TV every day?\u201d That\u2019s right, Boris.\nYou don\u2019t like knife crime, but you\ndon\u2019t want to ban knives from all people in all situations, do you? No one\u2019s\nsuggesting we do the same for nudity.\nAnd here\u2019s the crux of it, Boris: con-text. Kim Kardashian West chooses to\nshow sexualised images of herself in a\nmagazine, where they\u2019re accepted and\nthe audience know what to expect. It\u2019s\na woman presenting herself \u2013 not all\nwomen \u2013 as a sexual object, with her\nown consent. When someone wears\na shirt with scantily clad women\non television, it\u2019s using women as\nbackground imagery, reducing them\nto sexual objects.\nI hope Boris has learnt something\nhere, and I hope you have too, lest a\nfuture Imperial alumnus decides it\u2019s\nfine to announce the cure to malaria\nwearing a t-shirt emblazoned with\nthat photo of a vulture watching a\nstarving African child.\nPhoto: Imgur\nKEIR LITTLE\nCOMMENT WRITER\nShirtgate: Just what is the problem?\n\u201cThe mayor is unable to\ngrasp the simple idea of\nappropriateness in context\u201d\nWe\u2019re alienating future female scientists, says George Butcher\n\"My beef is not\nwith him, but\nhis defenders.\"\n\"Clearly Dr\nTaylor is\nno frothing\nmisogynist\"\n\"...it's using\nwomen as\nbackground\nimagery,\nreducing\nthem to\nsexual\nobjects.\"\n\n"

More\nviewers and no regulation changes for\nthe teams to worry about; it could be\nthe perfect solution to all of the sports\nproblems. Does it sound too good to\nbe true? It may be great for a casual\nviewer of the sport but in reality the\nsystem will just hurt every other\naspect of the competition.\nAt the whim of meddling\nmanagement, Formula One has\nundergone many alterations in\nrecent years to the frustration of\nthe sports core audience. These\nregulation changes were designed to\nincrease the competitiveness of the\nraces but have resulted in the cars\nbeing slower and give the air of a\nsport that is actively set against any\nform of innovation. This has been\ncompounded by the introduction of\nthe \u201covertake button\u201d (KERS) and the\nDrag Reduction System (DRS) which\nare are prominent examples of how\nthe action has been tampered with to\nartificially generate exciting racing.\nThese moves are punishing the core\nfan base of the sport who are equally\ninterested in the technical aspects\nas the racing. Already discontented\nseasoned viewers have also had to\ncope with a series of adjustments\nto the way in which the points are\nawarded at the races designed to\nreward more aggressive driving. The\nsystem has changed from 10 points\nbeing given to the winner and only\nthe top six positions scoring in 2002\nto now where the top ten placed cars\nare handed points and the winner\nreceives 25.\nAwarding double points in the race\nat Abu Dhabi suggests that the race is\nin some way more important than the\nother 18 but the challenges facing the\nteams are exactly the same as at many\nof the other venues. The distance\ncovered over the duration of the race\nis the same and the weather wont\nplay a part as the track is guaranteed\nto be bone dry throughout. The\nYas Marina Circuit is one of many\nexamples of a Hermann Tilke design\non the Formula One calendar which,\nwith run-off areas that stretch for\nmiles, offers few challenges to the\ndrivers during the course of a lap. The\nonly factor of note is that the race\ncommences in daylight and finishes\nunder artificial lighting which, with\nother races offering it, is just another\ngimmick.\nBut what about the teams? Giving\na greater share of the points later\non in the season penalises the teams\nwho start the year with a good\npackage and those that do not have\nthe capacity to develop their car\nthroughout the season. The smaller\nteams with tighter budgets invariably\nstop development on the current\ncar when they begin designing its\nsuccessor \u2013 typically around August\nor September \u2013 whereas larger teams\nsuch as Mercedes and Red Bull\nhave the workforce and capital to\ndo both simultaneously. When the\nprize money awarded to each team\nis determined by their finishing\nposition in the championship, it\nhardly seems fair to penalise those\nwith little money even further.\nHad the system been introduced\nbefore, it would have had major\nimpacts on the outcomes of previous\nworld championships. Hamilton\nwould never have been crowned\nworld champion in 2008 with the\ntitle instead going to Felipe Massa\nwhen he won the final race in Brazil.\nFernando Alonso would have\nfinished ahead Sebastian Vettel in\n2012 and Michael Schumacher\u2019s\nrecord breaking seven titles, five of\nwhich were consecutive, would\u2019ve\nbeen reduced by one through losing\nthe 2003 championship to Kimi\nRaikkonen. Having the result of a\nchampionship decided on the whim\nof the already controversial F1\nStrategy Group would generate a huge\nbacklash that could do lasting damage\nto the reputation of the sport.\nCould double points be translated\ninto other sports? If one day football\nfanatics across the country awoke\nto the news that the Premier League\nwill be awarding double points on\nthe last day of the season the reaction\nwould unlikely be positive. Why is\none match worth more than another?\nWhat if we are playing away from\nhome? Have we got an easy draw? It\ncould hardly be claimed as fair when\nthe difficulty of the each game varies\nso greatly. Many of these points\nextend to Formula One where cars are\nsuited to particular types of circuit\nand home advantage may be at play.\nThe double points system is just\nanother example of Formula One\nmoving away from it roots as a\nrespected and technical sport and\nerring towards light entertainment\nfor a Sunday afternoon. The\nstranglehold that parties of\ncommercial investors have over\nthe direction of Formula One will\ninevitably discourage the sports core\naudience from watching the coverage\nin the future. If the result of the world\nchampionship this year is affected by\nthe system in place for Abu Dhabi,\nthe repercussions will resonate long\ninto the future and could cripple the\nfranchise as a whole.\nYear Winner Double Points Winner\n2012 Sebastian Vettel Fernando Alonso\n2008 Lewis Hamilton Felipe Massa\n2003 Michael Schumacher Kimi Raikkonen\nChampionships that would have gone elsewhere if double points had been in use.\nWho will be smiling on Sunday?\nPhoto: Action Images\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 17\n21.11.2014\nFELIX\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk Tech Editors Jamie Dutton & Osama Awara\nThe release of the iPad in the\nUK in the early summer of\n2010 was a watershed moment\nwhich forever changed the way we\ninteract with application technology.\nIt was only a matter of time before\na number of social entrepreneurs\ndecided to weave the creative talent\ntogether in the form of conventions,\nand seeing promise and potential\nin the emerging technological\nindustries, catalyse creative\ndevelopment in the area. Apps World\nis one such conference which has been\ngrowing since its debut five years ago,\nwhich means that on Wednesday\n12 November 2014, I attended the\nbiggest developer conference ever\nheld in the UK to date.\nAfter finally reaching my\ndestination, a medium-sized hall in\nthe corner of the ExCel exhibition\ncentre, I registered for my press pass\n(which is required to attend all the\nconferences and would normally set\nyou back the value of the Gold Pass,\n\u00a3995) and took a look inside. My first\nimpression was disheartening. I saw\nrepresentatives from start-ups in\nneatly pressed suits, wearing faces of\nuncomfortable courtesy in a field of\nstalls awash in blue, grey, and black. I\nsaw nothing of the open, expressive,\nand passionate start-up culture\nI was expecting \u2013 hardworking,\nindependent, and creative developers\n\u2013 and all of the hard, cold masks\nreminiscent of the ones given to every\nnew employee of the financial sector\neach year. This was when I made the\n(perhaps premature) decision to skip\nthe party in the evening at the O2,\nwith an entry fee of \u00a355.\nHowever, not being one to be\ndeterred by my refuted expectations,\nI headed inside to take a look at the\nstalls which were shared between\nmarketers from established\ncompanies, start-ups, and game\ndevelopers. The former, including\nbrands such as Amazon, focussed\nentirely on selling their product to\ndevelopers.\nI recognised half the brands\nfrom the questionable advertising\narising from mass-contacting and\nabusing my company\u2019s contact\ndetails. Upon being questioned by\nme on the product specifics, none of\nthe representatives could actually\nanswer my questions as a developer\n(\u201chow easy is this API to integrate\ninto my app compared to other\nnetworks?\u201d to the Amazon mobile\nads representative, for example)\nwhich effortlessly exposed them as\npure marketers, ill-suited to pitching\nproducts they know little about to\nseasoned developers and passionate\nenthusiasts.\nHaving moved past this rather\npainful kick in the teeth, I headed\nover to where the start-ups and game\ndevelopers were showcasing their\nproducts. I was surprised to learn\nthat most of these were in alpha or\nbeta stage, and that they came to\ngain exposure through the press or\nperhaps even funding opportunities.\nA team of designers showed me\ntheir Oculus Rift virtual beach\nsimulation, and I had a chat with a\nTaiwanese developer releasing his\nAndroid game onto the Western\nmarket. I tried a web-based browser\ngame and then broke the physics of\nan arcade simulation just around the\ncorner.\nI was feeling slightly better at\nthis point \u2013 this is the side of the\nindustry that sufficiently motivated\nme to teach myself four years of\nprogramming in the first place \u2013 but\nI couldn\u2019t ignore the tendency to\nlean towards the investor-focussed\ndisplays. In short, there were a lot\nof creative ideas in development,\nbut they were all exactly that: in\ndevelopment, and almost certainly\nlooking for money, rather than\nexposure.\nThe \u2018workshops\u2019 which one would\nnormally have to pay so much for\nturned out to be mainly panels, with\npeople with long titles giving tips in\nmonotonic voices about how \u2018best\u2019\nto develop and implement strategies\nfor the specific platforms. Since there\nwasn\u2019t a unified timetable in the first\nplace, choosing which workshops\nCommercialisation in creative technology\nXuan Chen discusses his disappointing trip to the UK Apps Conference\n\"...Exposed\nthem as pure\nmarketers,\nill-suited\nto pitching\nproducts\nthey know\nlittle about\nto seasoned\ndevelopers\nand\npassionate\nenthusiasts\"\n\"There were a\nlot of\ncreative\nideas in\ndevelopment,\nbut they were\nall exactly\nthat: in\ndevelopment,\nand almost\ncertainly\nlooking\nfor money,\nrather than\nexposure\"\nto attend added extra stress to the\nevent participator as you\u2019d always be\nmissing out on something whilst you\nwere in a different room listening to a\ndifferent panel, and it wasn\u2019t exactly\nthe kind of material you could drop\nin and out of.\nThe panels may have been of\nsome use to some extremely niche\ndevelopers but they weren\u2019t overtly\nengaging or interesting; you have\nto sit down, take notes, and pay\nattention to get the most out of it.\nCredit should be given to those\ncompanies which did make an\neffort with adding creative flair\nto their product marketing and\nsending passionate developers to\nengage with the passing audience,\nbut unfortunately they were the\nminority and I get the impression\nthat the target audience (young, naive\nbusiness school grads who think that\nturning up in a suit is impressive)\ndidn\u2019t care that much about their\nefforts either.\nI absolutely hate the side of\ncapitalism which suffocates the\ncreative industries in favour of\ncapital-returning investments.\nUnfortunately, the event that I so\nhoped to be a stalwart unification\nof opposition against the corporate\nnorms came very close to being\njust a networking event for those\nexact people. I sincerely hope that\ntechnologies continue to evolve at\ntheir current expeditious pace, so that\nthose with real creative passion can\ncontinue to stay one step ahead of\nthe soul-crushing capitalism; able to\nshowcase their unique creations and\ndesigns and to receive just praise and\nadmiration for it in the future.\nPhoto: Xuan Chen\nPhoto: Xuan Chen\n\n"

    "content": "15 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n21.11.2014\nScience Editor James Bezer & Lauren Ratcliffe\nScience\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s the space mission that has had\nboth scientists and members of\nthe wider public waiting with\nbaited breath. The Rosetta mission\nhas been a nail-biter of a ride since\nthe awakening of the craft back in\nJanuary, and has left news rooms\nand control rooms alike buzzing\nall through summer as the craft\napproached its final destination that\nit\u2019s taken ten years to reach.\nBeginning its journey in March\n2004, Rosetta launched from French\nGuinea and took to the skies, skating\naround the planets of the Solar\nSystem and finally dropping into a\ndeep sleep to conserve energy in 2011.\nNamed after the Rosetta Stone, the\narchaeological relic that allowed for\ndeciphering of the hieroglyphics,\nscientists hoped that the spacecraft\nwould help unravel the mysteries\nsurrounding comet composition, and\ndiscover more about the origins and\nevolutions of the solar system.\nRosetta targeted 67P, a comet that\ncompletes an orbit of the sun every\n6.45 years and rotates every 12.4\nhours through its axis. Shaped like\na roughly hewn dung bell, it has two\nrotund protrusions that extend away\nfrom each other and is roughly 4km\nwide and long at its widest points.\nSamples taken from the comet show\nthat it might actually have been\ntwo separate comets at one point\nthat have fused together, as each\nprotrusion has its own separate core.\nRosetta reawakened back in\nJanuary, much to the anticipation of\nthe team back at home and the rest\nof the world waiting eagerly for news\nfrom the spacecraft. When the signals\nwere sent back to the European\nSpace Agency after several hours of\nagonising wait, the world erupted in\nexcitement, although it still seemed\nthat the odds were against this tiny\ncraft flying millions of miles away in\nspace.\nAt the time, scientists were still\nstaying realistic and weren\u2019t ruling\nout failure just yet. Said Paolo Ferri,\nthe head of missions operations\nat ESA: \u201cThere is a possibility that\nwe\u2019re not going to hear anything.\nTwo-and-a-half years are a long time.\nWe\u2019re talking about sophisticated\nelectronics and mechanics. We\u2019ve\ntaken all possible precautions for\nthis not to happen but of course we\ncannot exclude that problems may\nhave happened.\u201d\nFortunately, everything went\nsmoothly from the hibernation\nreawakening onwards. Rosetta was\nable to approach the comet, descend\nclose to its surface, then finally\ndeploy its landing probe, known as\nPhilae. Around the size of a fridge,\nPhilae boasts sampling and recording\nequipment, including a drill to take\nsamples from the surface and a\ncamera to take photos.\nThe only hitch occurred when\nPhilae bounced upon impact when\ndropped onto the comet. Philae\nbounced twice across the surface of\nthe space rock, and then came to rest\nat an angle, with solar panels hidden\nfrom the sun. It is thought that the\nsurface of the comet was so dense\nthat the hooks of Philae were unable\nto anchor it sufficiently enough to\nprevent it moving further.\nDespite sunlight hitting the\npanels for only 90 minutes every\n12 hours, all 10 of the instruments\non board managed to collect data.\nTemperatures were taken, photos\nwere captured and a small sample was\ntaken from the surface of the comet\nand analysed.\nPhilae struggled on for 64 hours\nbefore its batteries gave out, and\n\u201cShh... Philae is fast asleep.\u201d\nPhilippa Skett recaps the Rosetta mission and the future of Philae\nit now lies dormant, riding the\ncomet around the solar system as it\napproaches the sun. The team back at\nESA have managed to reposition the\nprobe so that one of its solar panels is\nfacing upwards and has the potential\nto be reactivated once closer to the\nsun. It may come alive once more\nand send further information back\nto earth, but already the mission is\nconsidered a major success.\nThe final message from the official\nPhilae Twitter account simply said:\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you more about my new\nhome, comet 67P soon ... zzzzz.\u201d\nBut why hunt down comets? As\nthey have been flying around since\nthe start of the solar system, they are\nalmost like flying time capsules; they\nusually haven\u2019t changed in 4.6 billion\nyears. They sweep up molecules in\ntheir dusty atmospheres and hold\nonto them as they spin around the\nsolar system, forming a cosmological\nscrapbook of all the debris that has\nbeen flying around space since the\nbirth of the solar system.\nLatest news from ESA confirms\nthat Philae has detected organic\nmolecules on the surface of 67P,\nwhich are now being analysed to see\nhow complex they are. Although\nRosetta has already detected\nammonia, methane, methanol and\neven formaldehyde in the coma \u2013 the\ngases that surround the comet \u2013 the\ndream was to discover amino acids,\nthe building blocks of proteins and all\nlifeforms on Earth.\nSaid Dr Matt Taylor, one of ESA\u2019s\nRosetta project scientists: \u201cthe data\ncollected by Philae and Rosetta is set\nto make this mission a game-changer\nin cometary science.\u201d\nRosetta will continue to follow the\ncomet as it approaches the sun, so the\nstory doesn\u2019t end here. Rosetta will\napproach the surface of the comet\nitself in the future, which might give\nus another opportunity to learn any\nother secrets 67P may be hiding. For\nnow, all we do is wait.\n2nd March 2004\nRosetta launches on an Ariane\n5 rocket from Kourou,French\nGuiana.\n4th March 2005\nRosetta executes its irst fly-by\nback towards the Earth,and is so\nclose that amateur astronomers\nare able to capture it on ilm.\n4th July 2005\nRosetta captures images of the\ncollision between comet Tempel 1\nand another spacecraft,known as\nDeep Impact.\nSeptember 2008\nPerforms a fly-by of asteroid 2867\nSteins,a small main belt asteroid.\n16th March 2010\nRosetta observes the dust trail\nof asteroid P/2010 A2,previously\nthought to be a comet.\n10th July 2010\nRosetta flies by 21 Lutetia,a large,\nmain-belt asteroid,and takes\nphotos.\n8th June 2011\nRosetta goes into hibernation,as\nall electronics except the on-board\ncomputer and hibernation heaters\nare switched off.\n20th January 2014\nRosetta surfaces out of 31-month\nhibernation mode\n7th May 2014\nRosetta begins to alter its route to\nbring it in line with the Comet 67P\n14th July 2014\nThe cameras on board send back\nphotos of Comet 67P for the irst\ntime.\n6th August 2014\nRosetta arrives at Comet 67P,\ndetermined a stable orbit pattern\nand began to scope for a suitable\nlanding location.\n4th September 2014\nData is sent back from Rosetta to\nEarth,showing that the comet is\ndevoid of water-ice patches.\n10th September 2014\nRosetta approaches the surface of\nthe comet,and begins to orbit 67P\naround 29km above its surface.\n12th November 2014\nPhilae makes touchdown on the\nsurface of 67P.\n15th November 2014\nPhilae goes into hibernation as its\nbatteries die due to limited solar\nexposure.\nThe timeline\nof the Rosetta\nmission\nPlucky Philae settles on the surface of comet 67P Photo credit: ESA\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9\n21.11.2014\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBankers are Wankers: the dark side\nof Canary Wharf\n\u201cIhate this time of the year.\nIt feels like we\u2019re shopping\naround careers fairs for\nthe rest of our lives,\u201d complains\nmy flatmate, who has changed his\ndream job aspiration for the tenth\ntime in a year. Anyone in their\ncurrent penultimate year of study\ncan relate, as internship application\ndeadlines loom and marketers at\nthe aforementioned careers fairs\nbegin eagerly hounding intimidated\nstudents in order to get their share\nof Imperial graduates, the smartest\nyoung adults in the country. By this\ntime, you\u2019ll have narrowed down the\nchoice to at perhaps just a few careers\nleft. Here\u2019s a hint; if front-office\nbanking is one of them, it\u2019s time to\ngrab a pen and cleanse your soul by\ngouging that option from your head.\nThe truth is that these certain\njobs are motivated by nothing but\nthe worst of capitalistic greed and\nthe desire to proliferate one\u2019s own\npersonal wealth, with absolutely\nno contribution or side-effects to\nsociety. It becomes an even greater\nshame when you realise that, like you,\nthese traders and certain investment\nbankers are smart people who simply\nchose to further their own social\nposition in a capitalist society in the\nmost inconsiderate and detrimental\nway possible. (One banker helpfully\nproclaimed the enlightening\nstatement pointing out that they\ndo, in fact, contribute to society by\npaying their taxes.)\nYou, whether you feel this way right\nnow whilst still studying at Imperial,\nare one of the most intelligent people\nin your generation. You are blessed\nwith enough intellectual capability\nand motivation to be able to succeed\nand live a comfortable life whatever\nyou choose to do. We are some of the\nluckiest people in the country to be\nable to lead by example by having\nthe ability to succeed in anything\nwe choose to do. Surely it\u2019s not too\nmuch to expect that we will have\nenough courage to put our talents to\nuse in helping move society forward,\nrather than fuelling an ever-growing\nchasm caused by genetic-lottery-discriminatory capitalism?\nWill finding your own passions\nand turning them into a career you\nlove be difficult? Certainly. Will is\nbe harder than your degree? Almost\ncertainly not. Outside of Imperial,\nyou will receive immense respect and\nprestige just by having studied here,\nand this is a foothold you can choose\nto use to either get into banking\nand waste your life slaving away\nfor money, or to carve out a story\nwhich will inspire your friends, your\nfamily, your children, and anyone\nelse who happens to get to know\nyou. Don\u2019t you want the satisfaction\nwhich comes with doing something\nemotionally, socially, or intellectually\nrewarding? Don\u2019t you want to live in\na society of altruistic, creative, and\ncompassionate individuals, all who\nhave worked their own unique paths\nthrough life?\nYou should take note that my\narguments are not directed at all\npeople associated with banks. My\nspring internship with Credit Suisse\n(CS) did expose the cruel side-effects\nof too much capitalism \u2013 not what\nthey intended their programme to\nachieve, but it stands that the only\nthings they were willing to teach the\ninterns were the apparent reasons CS\nis so different to other banks, how\ncompetitive this scheme is, and how\nthey like to throw around the money\ntheir employees generate for them\n(compulsory boat party for week-long\ninterns; attendance is taken and you\nare still observed well into the night\nto see how you interact with the other\ninterns and staff).\nThe progression from internships\ninto employment can easily clarify\nhow shallow these \u2018insights\u2019 are;\nthis year, all of the spring interns\nin the investment banking division\nwere fast-tracked onto the summer\ninternship, and the conversion rate\nis roughly 80% onto the graduate\nscheme. Despite all this, I did meet a\nbunch of passionate, dedicated people\nin the middle and back offices (such\nas the IT department) who seemed to\ngenuinely enjoy their work for what it\nis. They are, to some extent, bystander\ncasualties of the abhorrent greed of\nthe front office; they now suffer from\nthe stigma associated from working\nfor a bank, when in fact only a few\npositions in the bank necessarily\nattract certain personalities of self-absorbed, egotistical creatures.\nFortunately for the future, the\nspecies of narcissistic trader will soon\nbe extinguished by the emerging,\nrapidly developing automatic trading\nplatforms. We can only hope that as\nsociety and the law slowly advance\naway from mega-corporations,\nthe same ruination will fall on the\ninvestment banking divisions and we\nwill be able to finally proceed with\nfocussing our priorities of equality\nand the universal recognition of the\nindividual.\nLights blazing into the night: this will become all too familiar.

It was at this hour\nthat 40 members of the Imperial\nCross Country and Athletics Club met\nto make the trip to the Brighton 10k\n2014, well before the opening of any\ncoffee shops and tube stations and at\nthe same time as most young people\nstagger home after a mental Saturday\nnight out.\nBut undoubtedly, it was worth the\nearly start.\nWith no rain and a pancake flat\ncourse along the seafront, it was\nalways going to be a fast race but\nImperial runners seemed to make\nthe most of the conditions to clock a\nridiculous number of personal bests\nand to take home the lion\u2019s share of\nthe prizes. At the front, the men\u2019s\nteam of Chris Olley, Liam Smith,\nChris Thomas and James Ellis led\nthe charge to be the 2nd men\u2019s team\noverall, having each run a personal\nbest. Sarah Johnson, Imo Simmonds,\nAlex Mundell and Kara Meunier\nalmost matched the boys when they\nstormed to third place in the women\u2019s\nteam event.\nIt was not surprising that the teams\ndid so well with all the shouts and\nhigh fives between runners as parts\nof the course looped back on itself.\nBeing able to cheer on your fellow\nImperialites both ahead and behind\nyou during the race is one of the best\nthings about the course, and really\ntakes your mind off any complaining\nyour legs might be doing.\nImperial stole more awards in the\nindividual prizes with Chris Olley\nand Alex Mundell winning the U20\ncategories. In the process, Chris came\n8th in the entire field of around\n3000 runners in a personal best of 31\nminutes 47 seconds. Sarah, while also\nforcing many of the men to up their\ngame, placed 6th among the women\nin a time of 37 minutes 31 seconds.\nOur success did not end with those\nat the front as there were many\nstunning performances from the\ndebutants at the distance and fierce\nintra-club competitive battles.\nOnce all the running business was\ndone, the celebrations included a\nnecessary post-race cake feast and\nteam photo on the seafront, complete\nwith sweaty face paint. Clearly, there\nwas need for celebration afterwards,\nat the civilised time of 11:45. Merry\ntimes in the local Wetherspoons,\nthe banter train carriage home and\na small after-party were definitely\nentertaining and didn\u2019t fail to\ndisappoint. The early evening for us\nfelt like gone midnight, and while\nI cannot confirm the stories of\nfresher\u2019s falling asleep on pub floors\nor falling down stairs\u2026 I can confirm\nthat most of the team were in bed by\n9pm that night after a truly epic day.\nIt\u2019s not too late to get involved in\nfuture IC XCA trips, there will be\nmany more next term. Email run@\nic.ac.uk or find us on Facebook.\nImmortals\nlose 22-12\nSunday 16th brought the\nImperial Immortals\u2019irst away\ngame of the season against the\nHertfordshire Hurricanes.The\nHurricanes are an impressive\nteam that made the semi-inals last season,the same\nas the Immortals.This was an\nimportant match for both teams\nas the Immortals were looking to\nextend their season to 2-0 while\nHurricanes wanted their irst win\nof the season.\nThe Immortals started on\ndefense,where they started\nstrong causing a forced fumble\nthat was recovered by Imperial to\nput on the offence.The offence\ncame up against arguably the\nsecond best defense in the\ncountry,which were on form for\nsure.The offense struggled in the\nirst half but the defense came\nthrough and limited Herts to\n19,making some huge goal line\nstops to stuff the high powered\nHertfordshire offence.\nThe second half was a different\nstory where the Immortals\noffence took charge,while\nthe defense remained strong,\nand put up 12 points through a\nquarterback run that made over\n50 yards by Bob Worksfromhome\nand lovely link up between Bob\nand Noach from Coventry.The\nhard running of Emmanuel\nOlagbaju and the explosive\nblocking from the offensive line,\nincluding Sweet Joe Downey,\nUgly Henry Turner,Pecs Badham\nand Rookie Markus Mohr,\nallowed the passing game to be\nset up which gave the Immortals\ntheir second touchdown of the\nday.\nThere has to be a special mention\nfor Kyung Hoon Moon who put\nin a massive effort taking snaps\non offense as fullback,defense\nas linebacker and special teams.\nThe game inished 22-12 to\nHertfordshire but the game felt\nlike anything but a loss with the\nImmortals more than holding\ntheir own,with so many injuries.\nThe Most Valuable Players were:\nKyung Hoon Moon (overall),\nBob Worksfromhome (offense),\nAlex Hitchinson (defense),Pecs\nBadham (line) and Markus\nMohr (offense rookie).Make\nno mistake; this game was\na statement to the rest of\nthe league that the Imperial\nImmortals play premiership\nfootball with or without their\nideal line-ups.\nSAM HILL\nPUBLICITY OFFICER\nPhoto: Getty Images\nPhoto: IC Cross Country\nALEX MUNDELL\nIC CROSS COUNTRY\nPhoto: IC Cross Country\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 33\n21.11.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Wild Symphony of Natural Talent\n\u201cThere are all sorts of birds here\u201d\nFar Away, the 2000 play by British\nwriter Caryl Churchill, which\nmakes its return to London in this\nproduction at the Young Vic, begins\nwith a young girl who sneaks out of\nbed and ends a mere 40 minutes later\nwith a world in turmoil. In between\nwe have meditations on power,\ncorruption, and danger, delivered\nat a breakneck speed by a confident\ncast of four, who traverse the simple\nset with a deft skill, making every\nmoment look effortless.\nChurchill is a difficult writer to\ntake on, with her work ranging\nfrom the surreal \u2013 Top Girls begins\nwith a dream sequence in which the\nprotagonist meets famous women\nfrom history \u2013 to the impenetrable \u2013\nher comedy about the stock market,\nSerious Money, is written in rhyming\ncouplets. However, director Katie\nHewitt takes a steady hand to the\nscript, crafting it into a sharp-elbowed\nwork that butts its way into your\nconsciousness. It is little surprise that\nHewitt obtained the funds to stage\nthe performance by winning the\nJMK Award 2014, given to promising\nyoung theatre directors.\nThe stage is deliberately Spartan,\nbut belies the complex mechanics\noccurring underneath: tables spring\nup from underground caverns,\nchains carrying fantastical hats\nstutter across the ceiling, and by the\nend several crater holes have been\nblasted in the floor. The cast tread\nthese boards with finesse, particularly\nSamantha Colley, whose performance\nas Joan brings a strong physicality to\nthe performance.\nDescribing a world of danger and\nmystery, the play is in three acts.\nIn the first, a young Joan confronts\nher aunt about what she has seen\nher uncle doing down by the shed.\nHer feet coated in blood, the girl\nenquires repeatedly; what were the\nscreams she heard? Who were they\nloading into the lorry? Whose blood\nis it? First annoyed, then cautious,\nand ultimately deceiving, the aunt \u2013\nplayed with a maniacal brilliance by\nTamzin Griffin \u2013 manages to pull the\nwool over her niece\u2019s eyes.\nThe next two acts continue in\na similar vein, becoming slowly\nmore surreal; now grown up, Joan\nfinds work in a milliner, crafting\nhats for the \u2018Parade\u2019. Striking up a\nconversation with her co-worker, we\nlearn about how the management of\nthe factory is corrupt, that there are\nlate night \u2018Trials\u2019 on TV, and that the\nhats they produce will ultimately be\ndestroyed. It is only towards the end\nof this act that the chillingly horrific\npremise is hinted at, something that\nwouldn\u2019t seem out of place in Black\nMirror\nIn the final act, the three characters\nare brought together as the world\nunravels around them. All of nature,\nfrom the plants to the insects, the\nanimals to the people, are turning\non each other in a cacophony of\nviolence, which culminates in a\nmonologue delivered by Colley in\nwhich she speaks about her paranoia\nwith a fierce clarity that never feels\nhistrionic. This energetic conclusion\nforms the ending to the play, and\nleaves us wanting far more.\nUltimately, this is the main\nproblem with Far Away; it offers us a\nglimpse of a mystical reality, invites\nus in, and then slams the door in\nour face. It may sound churlish to\ncomplain about the length of the\nscript \u2013 after all, a great play should\nmake you sad to have reached the\nend \u2013 but in this instance it feels like\nChurchill has not developed her ideas\nenough, and for me the play could\neasily have been twice the length;\nwhether Hewitt would have been able\nto steer her cast for such a length of\ntime remains unknown.\nWith its exciting script and\nwatertight direction, not to mention\na cast who are able to burn holes in\nthe stage with their acting talent,\nFRED FYLES\nARTS EDITOR\nAblinding light descends on the\ncrowd, momentarily dazzling\nus. In that moment, the\nworld of this production descends,\ntransporting us into a dystopia,\ndisconcertingly similar to our own,\nwhere nothing can be taken for\ngranted.\nGlare tells the story of Alex (Amar\nMuchhala) and his relationship with\nnew girlfriend Lea (Sky Ingram).\nAfter a bitter break up with ex\nChristina (Clare Presland), everything\nseems to be going extremely well\nwith Lea: in fact, too well. Uneasy,\nAlex talks to friend Michael (Ashley\nRiches) about her. Michael, a scientist\nin the Futurology Laboratory\nreveals that she is literally perfect, a\nLearning Exposed Android or LEA\nthat he designed specifically for\nAlex\u2019s pleasure. Initially appalled\nby this unbelievable suggestion, the\npossibility of its truth starts niggling\non Alex\u2019s mind, causing him to start\ndistrusting everything Lea does. In\nthis psychotic downward spiral, his\nwhole reality is thrown into doubt,\nculminating in a horrifying climax.\nI was apprehensive in the run up\nto this opera; the synopsis sounds\nless than convincing \u2013 a story of a\nman dating a robot. But as soon as\nit started, I knew I was completely\nwrong. The sci-fi thriller is not that\nsimple; asking questions of reality,\nidentity, authenticity and perfection,\nit makes us analyse our modern\nworld and all its hypocrisies. \u201cIf\nwe expect perfection all the time,\ndon\u2019t we always have to live in\ndisappointment?\u201d Is it something that\neven exists?\nThe Royal Opera House definitely\nsaw something in Danish composer\nS\u00f8ren Nils Eichberg. He has created\nan innovative sound world that\ncleverly augments Hannah D\u00fcbgen\u2019s\nlibretto, interlacing pre-recorded\nelectronic textures and nightclub\nbeats with orchestral instruments\nutilized in new, inventive ways. This\nwas the highlight of the work for me \u2013\nI had never heard anything quite like\nit. As the familiar voices of clarinets\ndistorted into unfamiliar synthesized\ntimbres, you were left completely\ndoubting what you heard in the first\nplace; it was genius. Coupled with\nlong shadows and stark neon lights,\nyou never felt settled in your seat.\nSurprisingly rare for opera, the\ntrue intentions of the work were not\nGlare - The Future of Opera Looks Bright\nKamil McClelland examines the ROH\u2019s new production\nmuddled by extraneous characters\nor a needless interval: just a simple\nfour-person cast executing a quick\nsuccession of scenes for a straight\n75 minutes. But for such a cut back\nproduction to work, you also need\nperformers who can carry this\nmetaphysical weight. Sensitively\nportraying her character with\nethereal vocals, Australian soprano\nSky Ingram was impeccable. And\nso were the others, convincingly\nembodying their characters so that\nthe implications of the production\nwere never lost.\nIn our modern world of Facebook\nand Twitter, where we are constantly\nconstructing an idealized identity of\nourselves, creating a narrative that is\nmost attractive to others, questions of\nperfection and reality are poignantly\nrelevant. Glare proves that opera has\na place in this world. And despite\nsomewhat stalling from its frenetic\npace half way through, this exciting\nand vivacious work masterfully\nblends sound and lighting to ask these\nkey questions. And is that not what\nart is for, altering perspectives and\ndisquieting us from our comforts? If\nso, this opera did an excellent job at it.\nGlare is at Lindbury Studio Theatre\nuntil 22nd\nNovember. Tickets from \u00a38\nFar Away is well worth seeing.\nPerhaps a trifle short in length, the\nplay nevertheless manages to cram\nin complex concepts, ensconcing\nthem in an atmosphere of extreme\nparanoia and repression.\nBeginning with gentle bird song,\nthe audience leaves the theatre with\nshrill cries still ringing in their ears;\nall sorts of birds indeed...\nFar Away is on at The Young Vic until\n29th\nNovember.

All that is known for\ncertain is that all Evelyn Gardens\nhalls will be shut down for the\nnext year. Jane Neary, Head of\nCampus Services, explained that\nthis is simply due to the Evelyn\nGarden Halls not being up to the\nrequired standard \u2013 whether the\nhalls will reopen in future years is\nsomething that will hopefully be\ndecided in the coming year, but\neven if they were to re-open they\nare on a limited lease.\nThe new site itself is divided\ninto four buildings, the tallest of\nwhich reaches twenty stories into\nthe sky. Block A, the southernmost\nbuilding, is to consist of purely\ncommunal facilities including a\nbar and restaurant, a volunteer/\ncommunity space and a gym split\nacross two floors.\nThe three other interconnected\nbuildings, B-D, will provide\naccommodation for 603 students,\n102 of whom will be in twin\nrooms with all rooms being en-suites. As with the newer halls in\nPrince\u2019s Gardens, the rooms will\nbe arranged into \u2018blocks\u2019 of 6/7\nstudents, each of which will have\na communal kitchen. The sample\nkitchen that Felix was shown was\non the 18th floor of Block D. The\nkitchens bulge from the side of the\nbuilding in such a way that they\nprovide views of almost 180\u00b0 across\nLondon through the curved glass-panelled wall.\nCampus Services were also keen\nto highlight the features of the\nnew rooms: a 6\u20196\u201d long double bed,\nand increased storage space as\ncompared to the last set of Halls\nbuilt by the College in Prince\u2019s\nGardens. However, some students\nhave expressed reservations about\nthe announced price of the rooms:\nthe expected cost of a single will\nbe \u00a3165 per week and a twin will\nbe \u00a3125 per week. Once the \u00a320+\nper week cost of a Zones 1 and 2\nTravelcard is added, the average\nrent per room will be higher than it\nis currently in Evelyn Gardens.\nThe College were also keen to\npoint out that there will be no\ndecrease in the Wardening ratios\nas a result of the move: provision\nhas been made for 12 Subwardens\nand 2 Wardens to be split across\nthe three blocks. Also there is space\nonsite for a Union office, and it is\npromised that students will be able\nto use the nearby Health Centre.\nOther communal facilities will\ninclude a multi-faith prayer room,\nstorage for 300 bikes, quiet study\nspace and music rehearsal rooms,\na rooftop terrace, a barbecue area\nand the usual communal spaces\nwith games and TVs for use by the\nresidents.\nThe location is significantly\nfurther away from Campus than\nthe current Halls. College were\nkeen to point out that the Central\nline will be running 24 hours\nby the time the new Halls open,\nand that there will be a Crossrail\nstation a short walk away when it\nbecomes operational. The building is still under construction, but the kitchens offer amazing views over...Acton Photo: Stephen Ball\n\n"

Let me explain...\nTeen Titans was a superhero\ncartoon (\u2018capeshit\u2019, as my flatmates call\nit) that ran for five seasons from 2003,\nbased on the long-running DC comic\nbook of the same name. It was fairly\npopular, with above average writing\nand characters for its time. I was, of\ncourse, the perfect age for it when it\ncame out, and for a while it was my\nfavourite show. It balanced drama and\nhumour, with interesting characters\nand stories, and a lot of it still holds up\ntoday.\nAround three years ago, it was\nannounced that the show was being\n\u2018revived\u2019 as a series of one-minute\nshorts called New Teen Titans, with a\nmore \u2018comedic\u2019, light-hearted tone,\nwith all of the original cast returning.\nThis was met with much excitement\nfrom the comic book nerds like me,\nsince we\u2019d grown up with the original\nshow and had fond memories of it.\nThen two things happened at around\nthe same time: Young Justice, a very\npopular cartoon with a similar premise\nto Teen Titans, (both were based on\noverlapping comics characters) was,\nfrustratingly, cancelled.\nNext, it was announced that the\nNew Teen Titans shorts were to become\na full series, called Teen Titans Go!,\nagain with the original voice cast, and\nagain with less of a narrative focus\nthan the original (and with cheaper\nlooking animation). The subtext was\nclear: Cartoon Network didn\u2019t like\nYoung Justice\u2019s adult themes and more\ncomplicated stories (they weren\u2019t that\ncomplex \u2013 it was still aimed at twelve\nyear olds). Instead, they wanted the\nsimpler, goofier, cheaper show.\nThe fandom didn\u2019t like the\ncancellation, and a consequence was\na big backlash against Teen Titans Go!,\ndespite us all being previously excited\nby the return of the Teen Titans to\nour screens. It seemed as though a\nlot of the (justified) anger at Cartoon\nNetwork spilled over into hate for the\nnew show, which hadn\u2019t even come\nout yet.\nThen when it premiered something\nweird happened: it was really funny.\nIt had a unique energy to it that drove\neach episode. The plots were goofy and\noutlandish, and the humour, while\nchildish, often had me laughing along\nlike I was a twelve year old, and I mean\nthat in a good way. The original show\nhad some great comedic moments,\nbut it ultimately wasn\u2019t a comedy and\nhad an overarching narrative, and so\ncouldn\u2019t get away with a punchline\nwhere, for example, the main character\ndies of old age. Teen Titans Go!, was\nnot bound by this limitation, took the\ncharacters all over the place and had\na great time doing it. Scott Menville,\nthe voice actor of the group\u2019s leader,\nRobin, gave such an unexpectedly\nfunny performance that Robin\u2019s\npersonality was changed by the writers\nto match it, turning him from the\ngroup\u2019s serious, badass commander\ninto a hyperactive, egotistic, neurotic\ncontrol freak, and it was hilarious. We\nwould never have known he had it in\nhim.\nAnd yet, the fan backlash persisted.\nPeople refused to watch \u201cthe show that\nkilled Young Justice\u201d. \u201cThey changed\nit, now it sucks\u201d, they were saying,\nessentially. Some fans even brought\nout the tired clich\u00e9 of \u201cthey ruined my\nchildhood\u201d, as if the fact that a new\nversion existed somehow diminished\nthe old one. It was a classic example\nof the fans\u2019 overinflated sense of\nentitlement, in my humble opinion.\nThankfully, finally, the show now\nseems to have found the following it\ndeserves. The Comic-Con panel, for\nexample, was packed full of excited,\ncheering fans. The creators even\ngenerated hype by announcing a\nYoung Justice crossover! In the end\nit was all really a weird story on the\nthemes of fandom and nostalgia-based\nentitlement.\nTOM RIVLIN\nTV WRITER\nPhoto: comicvine\nPhoto: comicvine\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t go\nout to the field anymore,\nnothing can keep David\nAttenborough away from TV. This\nautumn, he returns to the screens\nwith the series Life Story, an attempt\nto show how different animals share\nthe same rituals and habits across\nspecies.\nIt may be said that the production\ngoes a bit God-Almighty on the poor\nanimals, filmed while trying to get\non with their lives and inserted in a\nview that we are all part of the same\ngreat cycle repeating itself (insert\nLion King quote here).\nThroughout six episodes,\nAttenborough shows us feeding,\ncourting, and mating as we have\nnever seen them before . The\nmessage: animals to go through\nadolescence, school, pulling,\nmaternity leave, etc. exactly like us.\nAnd even if this is definitely a case\nof man anthropomorphising nature,\nit is hard not to be impressed.\nThe team spent almost two\nthousand days filming in a 1,850,798\nmile-trek that brought them\nacross all continents, recording\nmaterial for 64,000 DVDs. That\u2019s\ndedication.

The\ngame had to be paused until third-baseman Zayd Al-Haddad stopped\nbleeding everywhere, before pitcher\nBen Hollis managed to knuckle\ndown and strike out the final two\nbatters to retire the side. Imperial\ncame back strongly though, as\ntheir first six batters all got on base\n(including hits by captain Ashley\nNg and rookie Zak Meddings), and\nshortstop Edoardo Lisi came round\nto score. Unfortunately though, two\nplayers were caught stealing by the\nstrong arm of UCL\u2019s loud-mouthed\nAmerican catcher (despite being\nslightly drunk).\nBen continued to pitch into the\nsecond innings, giving up two runs\nbut striking out UCL\u2019s final batter, as\nwell as hitting UCL\u2019s catcher for the\nsecond time in successive innings.\nIn the bottom of the 2nd inning, the\nImperial bats really got going \u2013 the\nfirst four batters got on base, and all\ncame round to score. Tempers flared\nlater on in the inning though, after\na collision between Zak (who got\non third after an excellent double)\nand the UCL catcher. Despite a\nheated exchange, no punches were\nthrown, and the game carried on with\nImperial leading 5-4 going into the\nfinal inning.\nAfter some strong pitching by\nreliever Zack Wang, the game was tied\nat five going into the final inning.\nImperial needed only one run to walk\noff with the victory. Unfortunately,\nthe first two Imperial hitters struck\nout, leaving it to Edoardo to seize\nthe win. It was not to be, however, as\nthe Falcons batter grounded out to\nsecond base to end the game 5-5.\nThe second game did not start well\nfor the Falcons \u2013 despite Imperial\nscoring in the first innings, pitcher\nAshley Ng gave up five runs for\nonly one out (a fly ball by someone\ncalled \u201cNeon Shorts\u201d, according to\nthe score sheet), until the mercy rule\nkicked in and the Imperial Falcons\nwere once again up to bat. The\nscoring then largely dried up for\nthe next couple of innings, (apart\nfrom a run from Howard Kwok in\nthe second) after some tight fielding\nand some excellent pitching by\nFalcons ace Edoardo (channelling\nMadison Bumgarner by pitching in\nrelief despite being the best pitcher\nwe have). Imperial\u2019s solid defence\nquietened the watching UCL reserves,\nalong with the driving rain and the\nfact that the Steve the Catcher\u2019s\nhangover seemed to have kicked in.\nAt 5-3 down in the top of the fourth\ninning, the Imperial bats opened up\nand the runs started flowing. After\nhits by Edoardo, Zack, Zak and\nJacques Smith, Imperial scored four\nruns to take a two-run lead into the\nbottom of the fourth inning. One\nrun and one out later (a great stop\nby short-stop Vincent Li followed\nby a great tag by first-baseman\nChris Carter), UCL had runners on\nfirst and second, and the situation\nlooked nervous for the Falcons. The\nUCL batter then hit a line-drive\nthat seemed destined for left field,\nuntil Vincent leapt up to make the\ncatch. Realising that the runner had\ngone, Vincent threw to Rhys Jones\nat second base to end the game, with\nImperial running out 7-6 winners.\nCongratulations on the whole\nteam for the victory, and for staying\npositive despite the dire conditions.\nThe team showed great mentality\nin coming from behind . Special\nmention to all of the new players,\nZayd Al-Haddad, Catherine Ding, Zak\nMeddings and Ben Sharpless, all of\nwhom made crucial contributions on\nboth games.\nLast week Novak Djokovic won\nhis third consecutive ATP\nWorld Tour Finals title whilst\nalso in the process securing the World\nNumber One ranking for the year.\nApart from a minor (and temporary)\nblip against Japanese player Kei\nNishikori in the semi-final, Djokovic\nswept aside all those in his way with\ndisdain.\nThe same could be said of his\nopponent in the final. Roger Federer\nmercilessly destroyed his opponents\nin the round robin, including British\nhope Andy Murray 6-0 6-1, before\nsqueaking past compatriot Stanislas\nWawrinka in the semi-final.\nBut then disaster struck, as Federer\nwas forced to pull out of the final with\na back injury. As a result, London was\ndenied the match that it had patiently\nwaited a week for. This does raise a\npertinent question. Given the one-sided nature of almost all the other\nmatches in the tournament, has what\nwas traditionally called the \u2018Big Four\u2019\nnow become a \u2018Big Two\u2019?\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know,\ntennis\u2019 traditional \u2018Big Four\u2019 did\nconsist of Novak Djokovic, Roger\nFederer, Rafael Nadal and Andy\nMurray. However, in the last year\nAndy Murray has fallen down\nthe rankings (although this could\narguably be attributed to the back\nsurgery that he opted to have late last\nyear).\nHaving said that, Andy Murray had\nwon three of the five tournaments\nhe played in in the weeks leading\nup to the final showdown. But that\nform was nowhere to be seen once he\nentered the arena for his match with\nRoger Federer. Federer dispatched\nMurray in just 56 minutes. A crowd\nof 16000 watched in shock as a\ntraditionally close match became\npainfully embarrassing for the\nformer World Number Two. It\ncapped a tough year for Murray, as he\nfailed to win a single match against\nFederer, Djokovic and Nadal.\nSome would say that it is harsh\non Rafael Nadal to say that he can\nno longer be included in the very\ntop bracket of players. The case for\nNadal is strengthened when it is\nconsidered that he reached the final\nof the Australian Open, where he lost\nto Wawrinka (although he did suffer\nan injury during the match), and won\nthe French Open. But the statistics\nsince the Roland Garros do not make\npretty reading for Nadal. He has not\nmade a final since Paris in May, let\nalone win a tournament. This should\nbe qualified with the fact that he was\nabsent from the US Open and the\nATP World Tour Finals with injury.\nBut would that actually have made\na difference?\nSince winning the US Open in 2013,\nNadal has only beaten Djokovic once\n\u2013 in the French Open Final this year.\nHe was even beaten by Djokovic on\nclay in Rome, a tournament he was\nwon seven times in the last ten years.\nAndy Murray\u2019s stats against Djokovic\nand Federer are even less favourable.\nMurray hasn\u2019t beaten Federer since\nJanuary 2013, and hasn\u2019t won a set\nagainst him since January this year.\nAgainst Djokovic, Murray hasn\u2019t\nwon since his fabled triumph at\nWimbledon in 2013. He won a set\nagainst him at the US Open this year,\nbut that remains his only set since\nthat game at Wimbledon.\nBut what about the chasing pack?\nHave Stanislas Wawrinka, or Kei\nNishikori (the two semi-finalists from\nlast week) bridged the gap enough to\nbe considered genuine contenders\nagainst the might of Federer and\nDjokovic? The statistics suggest that\nthey haven\u2019t yet. Wawrinka pushed\nFederer close last week, but Nishikori\nstruggled against him. Wawrinka was\nmercilessly destroyed by Djokovic\nin a haphazard performance last\nWednesday.\nTheir head to head records also\nseem to agree with this. Wawrinka\nhas only beaten Djokovic once since\n2006, whilst he has only toppled\nFederer twice in his career. Both\nmatches were on clay as well, easily\nFederer\u2019s worst surface. Nishikori\u2019s\nrecord against Federer and Djokovic\nis slightly more favourable, as he is\nonly behind 3-2 on a head to head\nwith each of them.\nThe bottom line? Through injuries\nto others Djokovic and Federer do\nseem to have pulled away from the\npack. Whether Nadal and Murray can\ncatch them back up will depend on\nhow they recover from their injuries.\nWawrinka and Nishikori would\nappear to be nearest to Djokovic and\nFederer at the moment.\nThe tennis world will be hoping that\nthese two can bridge the gap before\nFederer retires, as otherwise we may\nbe faced with a \u2018Big Two\u2019 becoming\njust the \u2018Big One\u2019.\nRookies star as Baseball beat UCL\nHas the \u2018Big Four\u2019 become a \u2018Big Two\u2019?\nKunal Wagle explains his fears after last week\u2019s inal that wasn\u2019t\nFederer vs Djokovic is a final we've all got used to Photo: Getty Images\nCHRIS CARTER\nIC BASEBALL\nPhoto: Getty Images\nPhoto: Getty Images\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 5\n21.11.2014\nFELIX\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe breakdown of Imperial's estimates of weekly expenditure by students\nWith college claiming that their\nnew bursary scheme is\u201cmost\ngenerous bursary provision of any\nof the leading UK universities\u201d\nFelix decided to investigate just\nhow generous the university\nis with its money compared to\nothers.\nIt seems that despite concerns\nover student consultation on the\nmatter,the changes will still be\ndelivering substantially more\nmoney into the pockets of students\nthan any other London University.\nWe looked at the bursary\nschemes available at London\nSchool of Economics (LSE) and\nUniversity College London (UCL),\ntwo other\u201cleading\u201dUK universities\nthat are also based in London,\nalongside the money available to\nthose studying outside the UK.It\nseems that Imperial will offer more\nthan any other London university\nwhen it comes to money per\nstudent,regardless of household\nincome.as shown in the bar chart\nbelow.\nSo just how do universities decide\nhow much money students need to\nlive on? Various student surveys are\nused to determine the cost of living\nin London or as a student in general.\nThe National Union of Students\n(NUS) has predicted that the total\nexpenditure of a student in London\nis around \u00a313,300 for living costs\n(\u00a323,500 in total when including\ncourse costs). This includes \u00a36,143\nfor rent.They predict that on\naverage a student\u2019s income from\nloans and funding comes to \u00a317,450,\nso another \u00a36,000 has to be found\nfrom elsewhere.\nAt UCL they use data available\nfrom the government,and\nconsider a total of \u00a3322 per week\na reasonable amount to cover all\nliving expenditure.LSE and King\u2019s\nCollege London\u201cbroadly estimate\u201d\nthat students should expect to pay\nbetween \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,200 per\nmonth for living costs.\nThe UK Government also ran a\nStudent Income and Expenditure\nSurvey,and this data is also heavily\nused to predict the costs of student\nliving.\nThe Student Living Index 2014,ran\nby the bank, also found that 22%\nof students nationwide are now\nreceiving less inancial support from\ntheir parents this year compared to\nHow much does it cost to live in London as a student?\nlast year.Despite this,the average\ncontribution per student per week\nof funds from parents is still \u00a3114.10,\nwhen considering all areas of the\nUK in which they study.\nThe survey also found that,when\nranked,students in London when\ncompared to other cities are the 6th\nmost\u201ceconomical,\u201dmeaning they\nmanage to pay the least amount of\nmoney,but still sustain themselves\nwith living essentials.London\nstudents do however spend more\nmoney than others on eating out,\nspending an average of \u00a317.10 each\nweek in Nandos and beyond.\nWhen it comes to alcohol, we\naren\u2019t doing much better: we are\n6th in the country for how much we\npay per week on beers and bombs.\nWe pay \u00a310.90 a week on average\nat the bar, although if nights at\nthe Union (or,more accurately, my\nbank statements the next day) are\nanything to go by,this probably has\na very large standard deviation.\nStudents in London are also\nspending the most on travel,with\neach student spending on average\n\u00a315.10 a week. The average of\nstudents as across the country is\n\u00a36.50.\nImperial have it\u2019s own estimates\nof how much student living costs,\nas shown in the pie chart opposite.\nDespite estimating that students\nneed \u00a3286 to live off on a weekly\nbasis as opposed to \u00a3322, the UCL\naverage,Imperial still offers more\ninancial support than our central\nLondon cousin.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nalso concerned that the appearance\nof reducing funding given to the\npoorest students to ease the burden\non middle-earning families would\nbe a short-sighted and unpopular\ndecision that doesn\u2019t serve our most\ndeprived members.\u201d\nThe report was presented two days\nto the board, prior to the Provost\u2019s\nboard decision that was made on the\n31st.\nDespite this relatively short turn\naround, the bursary scheme has\nbeen heralded as \u201c[representing]\nsubstantially the most generous\nbursary provision of any of\nthe leading UK universities. It\ndemonstrates the College\u2019s strong\ncommitment that every home\nstudent should be able to come and\nstudy at Imperial, irrespective of\ntheir circumstances.\u201d\nHowever, Council members are\nunconvinced that the changes are\nbeneficial. Some are concerned\nabout the apparent lack of\nconsultation that took place in\nmaking the decisions. Said one\nanonymous Council member: \u201cIt\u2019s\ndisappointing that after Acton\nand the Chemistry move that\nCollege haven\u2019t realised that poor\nconsultations really aren\u2019t the way\nto go. These changes have been\nmade in an unacceptable manner\nand I hope they realise the negative\nimpact that this will have on student\nsatisfaction.\u201d\nSaid another member: \u201cCalling\nthe Union President to a meeting\nat short notice and then ignoring\nhis recommendations completely\ndoes not count as adequate student\nconsultation. The Provost\u2019s Board\ncould at least pretend to treat\nstudents as equal partners in their\neducation.\u201d\nThe last time the bursary scheme\nwas altered was for 2012 to 2013\napplicants, when the tuition fee\nincrease also took effect. The package\nis reviewed on an annual basis and\nminor adjustments are made, but\nthis is the first major alteration since\nthen.\nThe Access Agreement and\nFinancial Support Working Group\nthen reviewed the package. This\nis a panel of college staff from\nacross all departments, including\nthe Vice Provost of Education,\nDebra Humphris and also included\nthe Union President. These then\nrecommended the changes to the\nProvost\u2019s Board.\nConcluded College: \u201cThe College\ntakes consultation seriously, but\nthis does not mean that after\nconsultation it will necessarily\nalways agree on every aspect of an\nissue with the Union.\u201d\nBursary funds available for students from Imperial, UCL and LSE Sources: LSE.ac.uk, UCL.ac.uk\nMaking it rain like it's 2016 Photo credit: SwindonAdvertiser\n\n"

    "content": "12 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n21.11.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAside from the fact that it\nmakes me feel old (It can\u2019t\nhave been ten years since the\nlast one, I remember that coming\nout when I was doing my GCSEs...),\nI have more problems with Band\nAid and the song, \u2018Do They Know\nIt\u2019s Christmas\u2019 than I can possibly\nkeep straight. Of course, there\u2019s as\nbig a difference between a dislike of\nthe song and the concept as there\nis between the concept and the\nincarnation. Band Aid 30 represents\na significant modernisation in the\ntrack, which aims to raise money to\ntackle the Ebola Crisis, and features\nsignificant changes to the lyrics\ncompared to the original in 1984,\nwhich raised funds to help counter\nthe Ethiopian famine.\n\u2018Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas\u2019\nhas been remade several times over\nthe past thirty years, with varying\nincarnations of Band Aid. Geldof\u2019s\noriginal criterion for selection\nof celebrities in Band Aid was\nhow famous they were. Logically,\ninclusion of as many of the most\nfamous people as possible can only\nincrease sales, and thus donations\nto charity. This can only be a good\nthing. But in the latest version, three\nfaces appeared in the Band Aid group\nphoto, presumably designed to tap\ninto a whole new demographic. These\npeople were Zo\u00eb Sugg, Alfie Deyes,\nand Joe Sugg, or as they may be more\nknown to you: Zoella, PointlessBlog,\nand ThatcherJoe. These are British\nYouTube vloggers, and three of the\nmost popular ones at that; Zoella\nalone has more than 6.5 million\nsubscribers.\nWith the primary audience\nof YouTube videos being in the\n13-17 age range, these names\nbring with them a huge group of\ndedicated fans to the cause. What is\nquestionable about the decision to\ninclude them, however, is that they\nhave no connection to the music\nindustry, making them the first such\ncelebrities to participate in Band\nAid. With many young YouTubers\nof comparable popularity self-producing and releasing both original\nsongs and covers, surely it would have\nbeen a better choice to feature voices\nwhich brought merit to the project?\nThey were able to contribute only\nto the chorus, where their voices are\nunheard, thus the only asset that\nthey bring is promotion in terms\nof reaching an audience (that may\nalready be saturated by the pop\nmusic/1D market) through publicity\nand the group photo, where they may\nor may not be spotted. Band Aid is a\nsong, and through choosing instead\nan artist such as Carrie Fletcher,\nwhose popularity on YouTube will\nmake her voice distinctive to the\nhuge number of people who know\nher, the song itself reaches out of this\ngroup of people, thus achieving its\ncore purpose.\nIt seems that instead of considering\nthe most appropriate youth celebrity\nfor this demographic, Bob Geldof just\ndecided that YouTubers seemed like\na good idea, and picked Zoella from\nthe top of the list of most subscribed.\nThe other YouTubers featured are\nher boyfriend and brother, which\nseems more than a little coincidental\n\u2013 while they are also prominent\nYouTubers, I do not doubt that she\nhelped orchestrate their selection.\nWhile this is, at face value, a good\npublicity strategy \u2013 reaching out\nto the largest possible fan base \u2013 it\nsacrifices outreach from the music,\nwhere it was not necessary to do\nso, reducing its potential impact.\nA recognisable voice on the record\nwill introduce fans of YouTube to\nthe song in forums other than the\nYouTubers themselves talking about\nit, where they otherwise would not\nhave noticed the song, if we to are\nassume that such a market has not\nalready been penetrated. By failing to\naudibly include these internet stars,\ntheir contribution is only in publicity\nthat they themselves generate by\ntalking about it themselves. It shows\nBob\u2019s lack of understanding of the\nway that more and more artists are\nusing YouTube as a platform to\nlaunch themselves; he is recognising\nits impact on a huge number of\npeople, which would be foolish to\nignore, but not its internal structure.\nThis is not the only example of Sir\nGeldof making seemingly rash and\nhaphazard decisions with the Band\nAid brand. Anyone familiar with the\nsongs will know that the lyrics are not\nBe honest: how many of these can you name? Photo: Band Aid Trust\nTESSA DAVEY\nSECTION EDITOR\nIs Bob Geldof\u2019s Band Aid out of touch?\n\"... generalising\nthis even to\nthe whole of\nWest Africa\nis misleading,\npatronising,\nand perpetuates\na negative view\nof Africa\"\nnecessarily fully sensical. \u2018There won\u2019t\nbe snow in Africa this Christmas\ntime\u2019 just plain ignores that fact\nthat Africa is a actually a very large\ncontinent with a very diverse range\nof climates, including snow, and \u2018Do\nthey know it\u2019s Christmas time at all?\u2019\nblatantly disregards the hundreds\nof millions of Christians in Africa\nwho probably do actually know that\nit is Christmas time. This is just one\nexample of how this song paints\na picture of Africa as a continent\ntotally unrelatable to the western\nworld, entirely fraught with suffering\nand misery, and ignorant of \u2018Western\u2019\nfestivities such as Christmas.\nThe latest version of the song,\naddressing the Ebola Crisis, becomes:\nWhere a kiss of love can kill you\nWhere there\u2019s death in every tear\nAnd the Christmas bells that ring\nthere\nAre the clanging chimes of doom\nWell tonight we\u2019re reaching out and\ntouching you\nBring peace and joy this Christmas to\nWest Africa\nA song of hope where there\u2019s no hope\ntonight (ooh)\nWhy is comfort to be feared,\nWhy is to touch to be scared\nHow can they know it\u2019s Christmas\ntime at all\nIn much the same way as the whole\nof Africa was not desert-parched\nand starving during the Ethiopian\nfamine, the whole of Africa is not\ncowering in fear and panicking about\nebola. Africa is a huge continent, and\nwhile the seriousness of this crisis\ncannot be denied, it is actually only\naffecting a tiny number of countries,\nand generalising this even to the\nwhole of West Africa is misleading,\npatronising, and perpetuates a\nnegative view of Africa as continent\nof suffering, rather than a continent\ncontaining many of the fastest-growing global economies. While\npity does sell, this isn\u2019t necessarily\nfair on the people of Africa, or those\nwho are being taken in and mislead\ninto buying the single. After all, they\nshould have a realistic idea of where\ntheir money is going, and who it\u2019s\ngoing to affect.\nI should finish by saying that, of\ncourse, this has been produced for\ncharity. As Bob Geldof says, \u201cIt really\ndoesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t like this\nsong. What you have to do is buy this\nthing\u201d. With around 200,000 copies\nselling in the first two days, this is the\nfastest selling single of 2014, and has\nalready raised a phenomenal amount\nof money to go towards ending\nthe ebola epidemic. Of course, he\u2019s\nright, but while charitable donations\nin any form can only help solve\nthis crisis, it isn\u2019t unreasonable to\nexpect celebrities who are regularly\ninvolved in charitable activities to\nraise the profile of such problems\nand Africa in a way which does not\ncontinue negative stereotypes. There\nare, of course, other ways to donate\nto the Ebola Crisis than by buying\nthis single, and maybe you should\nconsider giving to them instead;\naiding without perpetuating the\nold-fashioned distorted view that Bob\nGeldof seems so intent on continuing.\nBob Geldof may be trying to appeal\nto everyone, but both when it comes\nto Africa and the music industry, his\nideas are stuck in the past.\n\n"

I think the rumours of our scrap with the police on RAG\nJailbreak have slightly exaggerated the truth a bit, but it turns out Dorothy likes a guy who\u2019s escaped from\na Turkmenistan Jail. Anyway after staying in late doing our lab reports, she invited me back to her room\nfor some \u201ctea\u201d. I knew she meant to do sex stuff as she doesn\u2019t even drink tea past 9pm. Anyway one\nthing led to another and a;though we didn\u2019t go all the way we basically like did everything but sex. I basically\ndid a walk of shame down the corridor afterwards! Get Me!\nSunday 16th\nDorothy came over to my room yesterday evening. It wasn\u2019t pre-arranged or anything although I must admit\nI ironed my bed sheets beforehand just in case. This time this is way better than the three awkward\nnights with Jennifer at Leeds festival over the summer. Nothing smells of mud and I didn\u2019t get too nervous\nand lose my boner after about 5 minutes. Still not sure what I\u2019m with doing \u201cthird base\u201d though, I might have\nto do some google incognito mode searching later.\nMonday 17th\nI positively strutted into lectures this morning, diary. What with my new found reputation as an escaped\nconvict and now having an AWESOME girlfriend (well she is basically my gf, it\u2019s not of\ufb01cial). My god Imperial\nis the best place ever. I can\u2019t wait to tell Kris when he gets deported back to the UK. His snapchats are\namazing.\nTuesday 18th\nA couple of guys on my corridor had a movie night last night. We watched Fight Club, what a classic of\nmodern cinema I think it\u2019s the best \ufb01lm I\u2019ve ever seen. WHO COULD\u2019VE SEEN THAT ENDING COMING!\nDorothy stayed over after, we made out and stuff but I don\u2019t think either of us were in the mood for doing\nstuff, I was too busy thinking about Fight Club still. It was so profound about modern consumerist culture too, I\nthink I\u2019ll read some more stuff by Chuck Palahniuk.\nWednesday 19th\nJesus Christ I started reading more stuff by Chuck Palahniuk and I\u2019ve stopped already, that guy is fucked\nup. I\u2019m going back to Badminton club again today, I reckon I should have some hobbies outside hanging out\nwith Dorothy and reading Spiderman fan\ufb01ction on Tumblr.\nThursday 20th\nBadminton was really good, I managed to score some points. Not quite won a game yet but it\u2019s cool to hang out\nwith people from different courses and years. I\u2019ve sent like 200 Whatsapps to Dorothy, having a gf is hard.\nHANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS WITHOUT\nTHE NEWS\nWORST FEARS ABOUT\nACTON HALLS CONFIRMED\nDiary Of A Fresher aged 18 3/4\n\n"

    "content": "28 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n21.11.2014\nFilm\nilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park & Jack Steadman\nAll hail the new feminist Western\nTHE HOMESMAN\nDirector: Tommy Lee Jones\nScreenplay: Tommy Lee Jones,\nKieran Fitzgerald, Wesley A.\nOliver\nCast: Hilary Swank, Tommy\nLee Jones\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: Tommy Lee Jones/Ithaca\nWomen traditionally play\nsmaller roles in Westerns.\nThey are reduced to\nrich ladies, pretty widows, or poor\nprostitutes. They all get kidnapped\nat some point during the film, who\nthen of course require some sort of\nrescuing from male characters. The\nSalvation, which played recently at\nthe BFI London Film Festival, even\ntakes it as far as making the female\nlead, Eva Green, mute. But there is\na big shake-up of tradition in The\nHomesman, from director Tommy Lee\nJones. It tells the story of a woman\ntaking the bold initiative to venture\nout into the Wild West, transporting\nthree women who have gone insane to\na safe place in Iowa.\nAs a plain jane living in a society\nwhere women are defined by how\nthey look, cook, clean, and who they\nare married to, Mary Bee Cuddy\n(Hilary Swank) tries her best to\nfind herself a man, even though\nher interests lie elsewhere. She is a\nGod-fearing woman of independent\nmeans, a rarity in those days, and\ntherefore becomes an instantly\nmemorable character. When tasked\nwith this mission, she enlists the help\nof a low-life drifter George Briggs\n(Tommy Lee Jones), although she does\nher fair share of the heavy-lifting.\nSwank and Jones make a convincing\npair of heroes; Swank, the smart,\ndetermined, compassionate one,\nand Jones, the more reluctant, yet\nultimately noble one. Swank is hugely\neffective in a quietly restrained, but\nmeaty role.\nBeing outside of the societal norm,\nshe wants to appear strong and\ncomfortable with her choices, but in\nreality the constant reminder of her\n\u201cinadequacies\u201d as a woman pushes\nher to do things modern women\nnowadays would not even dream of\ndoing. As a rare female-led Western,\nit goes where no other Western has\ngone before, and Swank is up to the\ntask of portraying a headstrong\nwoman who is nonetheless plagued by\ninsecurities.\nThrough the female characters of\nThe Homesman, the audience gets to\nsee the common hardship and pain\nthe women would have had to live\nthrough. The three women showing\nsigns of insanity all have their own\nstories to tell, some told better than\nothers in flashback sequences, but\nall of them heartbreaking in equal\nmeasure. Grace Gummer, Miranda\nOtto and Sonja Richter are the young\nwomen being transported away\nfrom their home, and their blank\nexpressions from which all hope has\nbeen drained, highlight the level of\nsuffering they must have endured for\nyears.\nIt suffers from an excessively\nepisodic format, and struggles\ninitially to weave everyone\u2019s stories\ntogether, especially when it comes\nto editing in the background stories\nof the three women. But when the\ntrip gets going, everyone faces the\nharsh realities of surviving in the\nwild. There are dodgy men who want\nsome female company, whether\nthey consent or not is certainly not\ntheir concern, Indians also roam the\nplains, not to mention the fluctuating\ntemperatures making things extra\nchallenging. Food and water are also\ncommon issues, as well as having to\nkeep the three women under control,\nwhere good behaviour is not exactly\ncommonplace.\nThere are both beautiful and tragic\nevents along the way, and it ends\non a rather weak note that taps into\noverwrought sentimentality that the\nfilm was so careful to avoid leading\nup to the finale. Meryl Streep and\nHailee Steinfeld make what can only\nbe called cameo appearances, and\nit is the plot strand that concerns\nthe young Steinfeld that becomes\nproblematic.\nHowever this is a worthy Western\nto say the least, a rarity, especially\nin this day and age when it is\nincreasingly rare to have any Western\nreleased.\n\u201cAre you paying attention?\u201d\nEllen Mathieson decrypts Cumberbatch\u2019s The Imitation Game\nDirector: Morten Tyldum\nScreenplay: Graham Moore\nCast: Benedict Cumberbatch,\nKeira Knightley, Matthew\nGoode, Charles Dance, Allen\nLeech, Mark Strong\nThe Imitation Game is the story of\nAlan Turing, a story that most\nImperial student probably\nknows. He is the father of computing,\nthe man who helped end the Second\nWorld War an estimated two years\nearlier by cracking the enigma\ncode saving millions of lives in the\nprocess. But he is also the man who\nwas arrested for homosexuality, was\nsentenced with indecency, forced do\nundergo chemical castration in an\nattempt to \u2018cure\u2019 him, and ultimately\ncommitted suicide at the age of forty.\nBiopics such as this one are\ncurrently one of the hottest things\nin the film industry, with Mr Turner,\nThe Imitation Game and The Theory\nof Everything all being released in\nrelatively quick succession. They are\na difficult genre to get right, needing\na subject that is well known enough\nto get interest from the public, and\na story that is interesting enough to\nfill an hour and a half. The Imitation\nGame is just the right sort of film, by\nparts hopeful and heartbreaking, and\ncompletely engaging.\nThe role of Turing is taken by\nBenedict Cumberbatch, in what is\neasily his best role to date. Taking\ninspiration from his days as Sherlock,\nhe brings this fascinating man\nto life. From his interview at the\nbeginning, through his work on\nbreaking the Enigma Code, through\nto the end of his life, he is flawless.\nHis portrayal is so wonderful, that\nthe family of Turing have said that\nthey cannot imagine anyone else\nplaying the role. It will be surprising\nif Cumberbatch does not get his first\nOscar nomination for this role.\nThe other characters are less\nimpressive, the acting is solid, but\nwith so much time understandably\nbeing spent on Turing, you don\u2019t\nreally get a chance to get to know\nanyone else. Charles Dance as\nCommander Denniston feels\nparticularly wasted, only really being\nthere to get in the way and make\nthings more difficult for the leads.\nAs for the \u201cSuperheroes in tank\ntops and tweeds\u201d, as Matthew Beard\n(who played the youngest of the\ncodebreakers \u2013 Peter Hilton) called\nthe codebreakers, you have Matthew\nGoode as Hugh Alexander pulling\noff both arrogant and charming with\nequal aplomb and Beard as the first of\nthe characters to make me burst into\ntears. It\u2019s just a shame that you didn\u2019t\nget to see more of them.\nThe only major problem with\nthe casting was Keira Knightly as\nTuring\u2019s one time fianc\u00e9e Joan Clarke.\nKnightly has a long history of being\ntypecast as upper class women with\nstartlingly posh accents. The problem\nis, she\u2019s never been very good at this,\nand manages to make the only non-Turing character that gets any major\nscreen time into someone who is\nbland and, for someone who actually\nexisted, seem like a plot convenience.\nVisually, the film is stunning,\nmanaging to capture the feel of war\nera Britain. The first time you meet\nTuring he is walking through a train\nstation full of children being sent off\nas refugees. It\u2019s such an iconic image\nthat it immediately sets the scene.\nIt is Christopher, the machine they\nbuild at Bletchley Park to crack the\ncode, that is most impressive. Based\non the original still at Bletchley\n(though admittedly made slightly\nlarger with more of the mechanisms\non the outside to make it look more\ncinematically appealing), it gives you\na sense of the scale of what they were\ntry to build.\nLess impressive are the special\neffects, with the aeroplanes and\nbombs looking terribly fake. But\nthen again, this isn\u2019t really the sort\nof film that you expect them to be\ngood. Alexandre Desplat\u2019s score is\nalso excellent, gently reminding you\nhow you should be feeling. Never does\nit get in the way or get too loud and\noverbearing, it just sits subtly in the\nbackground prodding your emotions.\nOverall, The Imitation Game is a\nwonderful, if heartwrenching, film\nproved by the fact that it made me\ncry not once, but three separate\ntimes. Cumberbatch is impossible\nto look away from, and this is one\nperformance that shouldn\u2019t be\nmissed.\nAlan Turing poses with the lovely Christopher Photo: Morten Tyldum/\nLionsgate\n\n"

Sport\nImperial has also received part of\na \u00a365,000 lottery-funded grant\nfrom Sport England, as part of\nthe \u2018University Sport Activation\u2019\nprogramme, the successor to \u2018Active\nUniversities\u2019.\nImpetus is one of a number of\nsimilar initiatives, with King\u2019s\nCollege to receive over \u00a3240,000 for\ntheir version, \u2018BeActive\u2019, over the\nnext three years. This extra funding\nhas allowed them to run 22 sessions a\nweek, in a wider variety of locations\n\u2013 although this is perhaps not\nsurprising given their more varied\nspread of campuses. King\u2019s College\nhas also been running the initiative,\nhaving received funding in the first\nof two rounds so far.\nThe sports available, taken from\nstudent feedback earlier in the\nyear, include ultimate frisbee and\ntriathlon, in addition to more regular\nsports such as tennis and badminton.\nSessions are being delivered by Hyde\nPark \u2018s \u2018Will to Win\u2019, who own the\ntennis courts between Hyde Park and\nKensington Gardens, as well as some\nsessions by the Active Lifestyles team\nat Ethos, and other partners.\nInterestingly, football and gym\nwork do not feature in Impetus,\ndespite being the two activities with\nhighest participation among people\nThe Hyde Park Will to Win team at the courts. Photo: Impetus\nBen Howitt reports on Sport Imperial\u2019s new programme, Impetus\naged 18-21.\nXu Yag, who was one of those to sign\nup for tennis in the first week, saw\nimprovement within two weeks, and\ncontinues to enjoy the sessions.\nOne of the organisers is Jenni\nPhillips, the Student Sports\nExperience Officer (Participation),\nappointed as part of a restructure to\nseparate Sport Imperial\u2019s dual aims\nof participation and excellence (now\nrepresented by Hannah Blandford,\npreviously Sports Partnership Officer\nat the Union). When asked about the\nCollege\u2019s attitude to the program, she\nresponded \u201cthey recognise the gap in\nprovision [for people who don\u2019t do\nsport]\u201d.\nJenni is managing the promotion\nand marketing of the programme,\naiming to make it clear that Sport\nImperial caters to people with less\ntime, commitment and experience.\nAnother aim, long term, is to\nexpand the sports available currently,\nand to offer the chance for students\nto assist with the delivery of sessions.\nThere is also an awareness that for\nfull success, Impetus must spread\nto campuses other than South\nKensington \u2013 although the space may\nwell be harder to find outside of the\nSouth Kensington bubble.\nThere has been engagement with\nthe Sports teams, including ongoing\nconversation between the ACC and\nSport Imperial. Fears that College-run\nschemes might pull students away\nfrom club membership (we do, after\nall, already have an Ultimate Frisbee\nClub) appeared to be groundless\nduring the Active Universities\ninitiative, and it is to be hoped that\nthis success can be repeated both at\nImperial and at a national level. The\nonus will be on Clubs and Societies\nto engage with the initiative and\nmodify their recruitment methods\naccordingly.\nImpetus is open to suggestions of\ndifferent sports and people interested in\nhelping out \u2013 if you want to know more,\ncontact Jenni at jennifer.phillips@ic.ac.\nuk. If you want to take part, the form to\nfill out (only A6) is available at Ethos\nreception.\n18:00 on a Friday evening always\ncarries a certain amount of feelgood factor.However,on Friday 7th\nNovember,this was more a sense\nof jubilation as the results of the\nCiti Society Challenge 2014 were\nreleased,crowning the Chemical\nEngineering Society the winners\nfrom Imperial College!\nA process which began in July and\ninvolved a written application,\ninished with a inal of three\nsocieties battling it out for the votes\nof Imperial students.\nOur campaign was based around\ndelivering quality,innovation and\npassion: clearly demonstrating to\nCiti the value ChemEngSoc provides\nto its members ( conirmed by the\nImperial student body).\nAs a university so well known for\nits incredible diversity of clubs\nand societies,we are incredibly\nproud to have been recognised\nboth internally and externally as a\nleading organisation within this.\nWe would like offer our sincerest\nthanks to Citi Group for offering\nus this opportunity to excel and to\nthe vast number of students,both\nChemical Engineering and others,\nwho voted for us over the last\nmonth.\nALISHA WONG\nSECRETARY\nChemEngSoc win Citi competition\nPhoto: ChemEngSoc\nIf you look carefully, there is actually a person waiting to catch the frisbee.

    "content": "38 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n21.11.2014\nWelfare\nfelix.welfare@imperial.ac.uk Welfare Editors Diba Esbati & Chanon Wongsatayanont\nLet\u2019s talk: self-help resources\nDiba Esbati shares her favourite self-help tools\nIt\u2019s all well and good when you\nhave access to therapy, but\nsometimes it\u2019s be difficult to\nget that kind of professional help,\nbe it because of the notorious NHS\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\n(CBT) waiting lists, or a personal\ncircumstance that prevents you from\napproaching it all from a clinical\nperspective.\nTherefore, it is really useful to have\naccess to resources that can help you\ncope and feel better either while you\nwait for your CBT appointment or\nuntil the situation changes and you\nfeel safe enough to seek more solid\nforms of therapy.\nI have had people come up to me\nand ask what resources I found that\nhelped me cope, so I decided to share\nthese with you in the hopes that\nit will help someone out there. As\nalways, please note that these are\nthings that I found helped me but\nI\u2019m not a medical professional of\nany kind, and these are in no way\na substitute for professional help if\nyou\u2019re in an emergency situation and\nyou feel like you need to get help as\nsoon as possible.\nBooks\nFirst and foremost, things that\nhelped me understand what I was\ngoing through a bit more clearly\nand concretely were self-help books.\nWhen I first approached my GP with\nmy anxiety issues, she told me about\nthe unfortunate NHS wait times,\nand recommended a few books I\ncould check out whilst I waited, and\nthey each had the same approach.\nIt can be very overwhelming to try\nand find a good book amongst the\ncornucopia of books that claim to\noffer a cure for every mental illness\nunder the sun, but it\u2019s crucial to find\none that works for you if you want\nto go down that route. The one that\nI found helped me the most was the\n\u201cOvercoming ...\u201d Series. These books\ncover a wide variety of subjects and\ntake a logical approach to try and\nhelp you understand how to calm\ndown and slowly beat what you\u2019re\ngoing through. A great thing is that\nmost of these books are available via\nthe imperial college library, so you\ncan check them out for free.\nPodcasts\nAn unlikely useful resource that I\nfound were podcasts. It might seem\nweird, but there was something\nabout listening to a couple of people\ncasually discuss issues that affect all\nof us that really helped me. There are\nplenty of free podcasts out there that\ndeal with various different issues,\nfrom LGBTQ+ specific topics, to time\nmanagement skills and relaxation\ntechniques.\nMy favourite, and the one I found\nmost helpful, was a comedy podcast\nby Cave Comedy Radio called\nSex and Other Human Activities\n(SaOHA), hosted by comedians\nMarcus Parks and Jackie Zebrowski.\nThe reason I enjoyed SaOHA so\nmuch was because Jackie and Marcus\ndiscussed their own struggles with\nmental illness candidly, openly, and\nmost importantly, with humour,\nlaughing and joking about it all.\nThey also reply to emails and\nproblems that people write to them\nabout, but of course, everything\nIf you are concerned\nabout your own mental\nhealth,or that of a loved\none,there are people out\nthere you can talk to who\ncan give you advice,or will\nbe there to listen.\nSamaritans (24 hr\nhelpline)\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nWebsite: www.\nsamaritans.org.uk\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 9:30-17:30)\nWebsite: www.anxietyuk.\norg.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10am-10pm)\nWebsite: www.nopanic.\norg.uk\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,1.30pm-4:30pm)\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nWebsite: www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nWebsite: www.ukna.org\nStudent Counselling\nService\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.\nuk\nImperial College Health\nCentre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@\nic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal tutor\nregarding pastoral issues,\nespecially if you think your\nmental health might be\naffecting your academic\nperformance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nthey say should be taken with a\ntruckload of salt since their advice\nis predominantly for entertainment\npurposes.\nInternet Forums\nAs much as I would urge you all to\nspeak to your friends and family\nabout issues that might be bothering you, I understand that it might\nnot always be a viable option. Just\nbecause you might not be ready to\nspeak to someone you know person-ally, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to\nkeep everything bottled up \u2013 that\u2019s\nnot healthy, or fair to yourself! So\nwhat can you do?\nI found that finding a safe space,\nlike a forum on the internet can be\na wonderful thing, especially since\nmost people on these forums are\ngoing through, or have gone through,\nsomething similar and can both relate and give you appropriate advice.\nI can\u2019t recommend any particular\nforum, because it really depends on\nwhat works for you and what kinds\nof people you feel safest talking to.\nImperial College Counselling\nService Workshops\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that\nthe college counselling service\nruns stress management and exam\nperformance workshops at select\ntimes during term. Although\nI\u2019ve only attended one of these\nworkshops, and I personally didn\u2019t\nfind it massively helpful, I\u2019ve heard\nmany people say that it helped\nthem manage their exam stress and\nit\u2019s worth giving them a shoutout.\nTheir next workshop is at 12:30,\nThursday, 27th November, focusing\non building self-esteem, and there is\nan exam stress management one at\n14:00, Wednesday, 10th December,\nso it might be worth checking out.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that you will need\nto email them and let them know\nyou would like to attend, since places\nare limited.\nApps\nYou know what they say, there is\nalways an app for everything, and\nwellbeing is no exception. There are\ncountless, often reliable, smartphone\napps that you can use for things such\nas keeping track of your moods, what\ncould be triggering certain episodes,\nkeep track of your medication, and\neven wind down from a panic attack.\nMy favourite app at the moment is\nSAM (Self-help for Anxiety Management), which has some breathing\nexercises as well as several other\nanxiety management techniques.\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding a\nmuch more indepth list of resources\nthat you can use, I suggest going to\nmentalillnessmouse.tumblr.com where\nyou can find more tried and tested\nself-help things.\nThere are many online forums that can provide help and deliver it straight to your room Photo credit: Wyman\n\n"

Recipe contributions and testers, photographers, illustrators, something I\nhaven\u2019t listed...we\u2019re after the lot.\nThis is a long-term voluntary project, and an amazing opportunity to get your\nwork out to a much wider audience \u2013 we\u2019re talking student populations outside of\nImperial, and that\u2019s just the beginning! To get involved, drop us an email at food.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk. Carol will fix you a cuppa, and we\u2019ll talk shop.\nI feel issues of animal welfare, both\nin their rearing and slaughtering,\nare less contestable. Especially as\na student where money is on your\nmind, I\u2019m sure this affects most of\nthe meat you consume. But in the\nend, is there such a thing as humane\nslaughter? I feel any arguments to\nsay there is, are just pseudoscientific\nattempts to ease one\u2019s moral burden.\nCan you really know which way of\nkilling eases suffering the most? It\u2019s\nutterly unverifiable!\nIn fact, our whole meat industry\nis designed around trying to remove\nyou from the reality of this side of\nmeat production. We\u2019ve all seen the\nvideos of battery-farmed chickens;\nyet, when we go to the supermarkets\nand buy our beautifully packaged\nchicken breasts, it is the last thing\non our minds. I\u2019m sure fewer people\nwould want to eat meat if the packs\ncame with cigarette-style warnings.\nBut I\u2019m still fallible!\nNow, I am not perfect; becoming\nvegetarian is a gradual process.\nEspecially when I go abroad and there\nis no concept of vegetarianism, it is\nparticularly hard. How am I meant\nto experience Singapore if I never\ntry their fish head curry? It is so\nfundamental to their culture that I\nwould be missing out if I didn\u2019t!\nBeing vegetarian: not necessarily a huge \"missed steak\"! The use of this pun, however, is another story.\nPhoto: Creative Commons\nWhat a meaty issue! (not)\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nSECTION EDITOR\nWhen Kamil (you\u2019ll recognise him as one of our\nArts Editors) pitched this piece,I was really stoked.\nI\u2019m not deeply for or against vegetarianism myself;\nafter all,I live happily with a vegetarian housemate\n(who taught me how to make one of my favourite\ncream pasta dishes),and I willingly go meat-free for\nmy meals sometimes,so long as I\u2019ve had my ix of\nmilk and eggs.I do adore the taste as well of certain\nquality meat dishes (c\u2019mon,I work at a burger joint!),\nand for us girls it\u2019s a safe way of making sure iron\nlevels are in check.What I am against though is\novertly-extreme\u201cmilitant activists\u201d(as Kamil himself\ndescribes them)\u2013y\u2019know,the ones who guilt-trip\nyou for not subscribing to their cause,their school\nof thought,etc.So it\u2019s really nice to see some levelheaded thoughts on the matter...given that the main\nreasons I eat less meat when I\u2019m buying and cooking\nfor myself is both cost,and concerns over the quality\n(think battery chickens et al).\nPersonally I\u2019ve always been of the opinion that with\nmeat,it\u2019s really a matter of quality over quantity.\nBack at home and during GCSE Food Tech lessons,\nboth my Mum and my teacher always taught that\nit\u2019s much better to pay a bit more for a better-quality\nproduct and eat it less often.Bearing in mind that\nmeat was considered a special treat in the days of\nyore,I\u2019d have to agree.I\u2019d much rather be able to use\nevery single bit of a whole chicken that has been\ncarefully reared,compared to having to trim loads of\nunusable bits off a\u201cvalue-price\u201dbird,then watching\nwhat little is\u201cusable\u201dshrink like mad as it loses all\nthat injected water.Ick\u2013don\u2019t even get me started on\nthe taste.\nIn other (bi)weekly news,time for a confession\nbear: my body\u2019s been having a mind of its own.\nThrough no external stimuli (caffeine,all-nighters\netc),this week has suddenly been a week of weird\nsleep (two 4-hour chunks instead of the typical\n8-hour stretch at night) and slightly irregular eats\n(funny appetite fluctuations),and it\u2019s rearing its\nugly head already\u2013I just got up from my second\nnap today.Boy,am I glad I\u2019m currently on reading\nweek.At times like these it\u2019s all about the little\nachievements to keep you going.Woke up before 8\ntoday? Not bad.Ate all three meals and a number of\n(healthy) snacks? Way to go.Water intake for the day\nsuficient? Round of applause,yo.\nSpeaking about achievements...not too long ago I\npaid Dave and Luke at Brompton Food Market (next\nto SNOG) a\u201cwork visit\u201dto take product shots of their\nChristmas hamper offerings.You can actually see an\nedited crop of their confectionery hamper above...\nso many goodies! Given that I am by no means a\nprofessional\u2013it was my irst paid photography job\u2013\nand that we had almost no lighting equipment,I was\nactually rather chuffed with the outcome.As some\npeople have since asked me how to get that perfect\n\u201cfood porn\u201dshot (even before it kisses an Instailter or VCSOcam treatment) as a fellow everyday\nmortal...I\u2019ve been toying with that idea for a future\nFood issue.\nIn fact,I\u2019d actually like to hear from you if you\u2019re\na budding food photographer,as Food has got an\nexciting long-term project planned,and we need you\nguys for that.You know how to reach us!\n\"The\nproblem\nwith all\nof this is\nthat there\nis always\ngoing to\nbe some\nhypocrisy\"\nThe problem with all of this is\nthat there is always going to be some\nhypocrisy unless you\u2019re a fully-fledged vegan. However, it is only\nin small pockets of the world, like\nLondon, that such a lifestyle would\neven be possible because if it isn\u2019t\nmeat, then it\u2019s always going to be eggs\nor dairy. Practically speaking, it\u2019s a\nvery hard lifestyle to endure unlike,\nin my opinion, vegetarianism.\nI hope some of you will consider\nbecoming vegetarian after this article,\nor at least try to cut down on your\nmeat consumption and see how it\ngoes. Or if you completely disagree\nwith me, I would love to hear why.\nCome at me!\n\n"

This all\nsounds very familiar; the eminent\nand the famous are constantly in the\npublic eye, their lives scrutinised\nin every detail by scandal-hungry\npress. So a well written, moving,\nreflective and excellently performed\nplay on this recurrent issue of our\ntimes doesn\u2019t come a minute too\nsoon. But hang on\u2013 I forgot to\nmention \u2013 Accolade was written in\n1950.\nEmlyn William\u2019s startling modern\nand poignant play recounts the life\nof Will Trenting, a Nobel laureate\nauthor who lives in Regent\u2019s Park\nwith his wife and young son.\nScenes of familial happiness,\ncreative productivity and well\nto-do luxury paint a picture of\na happy, successful, respectable\nman. And all of a sudden, just as\nhe is about to receive a knighthood\nfor services to literature, this\nidyll apparently starts to unravel.\nGossip builds up on Trenting\u2019s\nlicentious parties in Rotherhithe,\nwhere he goes as Bill Trent, his\nfree and easy alter ego. He gathers\naround him drunks, prostitutes\nand other disreputable East Enders\nfor weekends to a bedroom above\na pub with blacked-out windows.\nAs his family and friends pop\nopen the champagne and celebrate\nthe honour, Trenting starts to see\nthat the knighthood may change\nis life, restricting his freedom\nand requiring unprecedented\nrespectability of him. And then\nevents start spiralling: first tip offs\nfrom his friends from Rotherhithe,\nthen police advice. To the shock of\nhis publisher and his middle class\nfriends, his books on the \u2018lower\ndepths\u2019 are not pure works of fiction\n\u2013 they are inspired by the author\u2019s\nfirst-hand experience of whores,\norgies and promiscuity.\nDespite Will\u2019s increasing\nuneasiness about the moral\nrestrictions he feels closing over\nhim, it seems that his life will be\nunaffected. His wife has always\nknow and always accepted his\npromiscuous inclinations. There\u2019s\neven an unlikely merging of his\nworlds, as his friends from the East\nEnd frequent his Regent\u2019s Park\nhouse, lightheartedly consoling the\ngrave and worried members of the\nupper class. And then it emerges\nthat, unwittingly, Trenting has\ncommitted a serious crime, one\nwhich, if publicly known, would\nirredeemably mar his reputation.\nBut, strangely, we can\u2019t help but\nsympathise with him. He\u2019s as\nhonest and unapologetic about his\npredilection for debauchery as he\nis totally aghast that his actions\ncould have led to harm. He makes\na clear distinction between socially\nimposed morality and fundamental\nethics. Alexander Hanson, who\nplays Will Trenting, portrays this\nfantastically, turning his character\nfrom a symbol to a man we can all\nidentify in, a man who can make the\ndistinction between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018well\nbehaved\u2019, who struggles with the\nincongruity with which he lives.\nIn the light of recent events, such\nas the Leveson inquiry, this play\ncomes across, first and foremost,\nabout a work on the role of the\nmedia in society. But it is also a\nplay about people struggling with\nGiven Dmitry Krymov\u2019s\nbackground, you would\nbe forgiven for being\ndisappointed when entering\nthe Barbican Theatre to see his\nproduction of A Midsummer Night\u2019s\nDream; trained as a set designer,\nhe created hundreds of pieces\nthroughout the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s,\nbefore starting the Dmitry Krymov\nLab, in 2004. One would then\nexpect the set for this production to\nbe phenomenal \u2013 an idyllic forest\nscene, perhaps, that takes us to\nthe site of Hermia\u2019s enchantment;\nmaybe the bank described by\nOberon, where \u201coxlips and the\nnodding violet grows / Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine\u201d.\nUpon entering however, the stage,\nwhich is little more than a blank\nwooden square, covered in a plastic\nsheet, strikes one as a little anti-climactic.\nBut have no fear \u2013 Dmitry\nKrymov is notorious for subverting\nthe traditional ideas of the theatre,\nand this production proves no\nexception. Before the show starts\na group of craftsmen linger\naround the front, before suddenly\nspringing into action; a large tree\nis carried to the back of the stage,\nwhile the audience is made to pass\nhuge branches down to the front.\nImmediately after, a fountain is\ntaken the same way, spraying water\nover the first few rows. We don\u2019t see\neither piece again. Welcome to the\nDmitry Krymov Lab.\nOver the course of the next ninety\nminutes, we are treated to a show\nthat delights, shocks, and ultimately\nremoves all pretensions of the\nstage, revealing a purity of theatre-craft unmatched by any other\ndirector working today. Taking\nthe illustrious Shakespearian work\nas a starting point, Krymov has\nstripped off any superfluous detail,\nuntil only the bare bones remain.\nThe quartet of lovers, Hermia,\nLysander et al, have gone, as have\nthe fairy group; All that remains\nare the \u2018Mechanicals\u2019, the group of\ncraftsmen who put on the tale of\nPyramus and Thisbe, the play-within-a-play which is \u2013 to Krymov\n\u2013 the defining feature of the work:\n\u2018I think it is the Mechanicals and\nnot the faeries that bear the main\ntheme of the play\u2019, says Krymov,\n\u2018that art is a dream\u2019.\nThe void left behind is quickly\nfleshed out with additions from\nthe Lab; acrobats, a consortium of\nRussian nouveau-riche, and even a\ntrained dog are present. But the\nstars of the show are Pyramus\nand Thisbe, two giant puppets\nthat traverse the stage unsteadily.\nOperated by 10 actors, they lope\naround the stage, exchanging gifts,\narranging bouquets, imbued with\nthe intense emotion of the whole\ncast. Krymov allows the processes\nbehind the work to shine through;\nthe fourth wall is completely\nsmashed, and the audience has the\nprivileged opportunity to be invited\ninto the magical, dream-like world\nof the stage.\nWhile this work is lighter than\nsome of the company\u2019s previous\nwork \u2013 particularly Opus No 7, in\nwhich the life story of Shostakovich\nis played out against a backdrop of\nhorror \u2013 it does not shy away from\naddressing some darker ideas. The\nfaux-audience on the side, who\ncollaboratively take on the role of\nTheseus, Duke of Athens, act as\njudge, jury, and executioner. They\nare the ones who control the fate of\nthe play, and it is not a hard stretch\nto conflate the power this elite\nhave over the theatre with their\ninfluence on mainstream politics.\nWhile the work being acted out\non the stage is light, what happens\noff-stage is anything but. These\nare ideas that cannot be spoken;\nthey must be shown \u2013 and are,\nmasterfully \u2013 through the medium\nof visual theatre.\nKrymov\u2019s reputation as a\nmodern genius precedes him, but\nhe has outdone himself with this\nproduction, which approaches\nShakespeare with the lightness of a\nfeather and the power of a battering\nram. Krymov is deconstructing\nthe entire practice, creating a\nnew visual language with which\nto express his thoughts. What he\nachieves on this stage within an\nhour and a half is nothing short of\nbreath-taking \u2013 weaving together\ndelicate strands of dreams & reality,\nnature & artifice, darkness & light,\nthe Dmitri Krymov Lab gives us a\nmasterpiece of modern theatre that\nis sure to stand the test of time.\nA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (As You Like It)\nFred Fyles lauds an unusual but phenomenal take on a classic\nDmitry Krimov Lab, A Midsummer Night's Dream (As You Like It):\nensemble. Photo: Natalia Cheban\nhis conflicting desires, about\nthe double standards which our\nsociety imposes, and about the\nresponsibilities which we have\ntowards loved ones. And it\u2019s also a\nmoving, funny and high suspense\nstory. What else could you want?\nThe cast is exceptional, under the\ndirection of award-winning Blanche\nMcIntyre who originally directed\nthis revival at the Finborough\nTheatre a few year ago. The stage\nset also helps to create a believable\nset (Will\u2019s study) which, thanks\nto the St James\u2019 theatre very open\nstructure, really absorbs the viewer\ninto the action. When the actors\ntake their bow after two and a half\nhours of tears, laughter and tension,\nit takes a while to acclimatise from\na 1950 study to a 2014 theatre.\nAlthough, as Accolade shows us,\nthings haven\u2019t changed much after\nall.\nCLARA C.

Mathias\nGold (Kline) is an American who\ninherits a nice looking apartment\nin Paris from his late father. As a\ndivorced fifty-something with very\nlittle to show for himself, he considers\nthis to be a new start for him, until\nhe finds out that the apartment itself\nhas an unexpected resident and the\nFrench property law that does not\nwork in his favour in any way; turns\nout, he actually needs to pay the\nelderly resident, Mathilde (Smith), a\nmonthly sum of 2,200 Euros, as a part\nof a \u201cviager\u201d agreement.\nWhat is advertised as a quirky\ncomedy involving grown-ups, works\nwell in the first half or so. The initial\nmeeting between Kline and Smith hits\nall the right notes as they awkwardly\ndiscuss the financial aspect of this\nunique situation. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\nasks Kline boldly, after discovering\nthat following the current resident\u2019s\ndeath, the monthly payment will be\nno more. It involves Mathias trying\nto make as much money as possible,\nselling off various bits of furniture\naround the house, so that he can get\nby, whilst having to constantly butt\nheads with not only Mathilde, but also\nwith her daughter living in the house.\nChlo\u00e9 (Kristin Scott Thomas), whose\nhostility towards this unwelcome,\nscheming guest serves greatly towards\nthe film\u2019s comedic intentions, further\ndemonstrates some great chemistry\nthe three main actors share.\nBut then the narrative starts to\ntake more and more serious turns.\nPersonal problems from each side\nsurface and it turns out the three\ncharacters share more things in\ncommon than they first realised.\nRecovering alcoholic Mathias has a\nlot of personal demons he needs to\ndeal with, one of them being issues\nwith his father who he was not at\nall close to. He has troubling stories\nfrom his childhood, having witnessed\nand gone through things that no\nchild ever should, and believe it or\nnot Mathilde is somewhat involved\nin Mathias\u2019 troubles. The film has\ntonal difficulties trying to balance\nthe comedy and the drama, but\nultimately with My Old Lady it is a\nmix that does not quite work to the\nfull extent.\nThe message it wants to convey\nis clear. Children of broken homes\ncan be more damaged than they\nare willing to admit, with a more\nnegative outcome of life and views on\nrelationships, which is perhaps why\none should think twice before fooling\naround with someone you should not,\nespecially when there are children\ninvolved.\nThomas and Smith provide vibrant\nsupport for the film throughout, but\nin the end this is Kline\u2019s show through\nand through. He shows an enormous\nrange of diversity here, in addition\nto showing the audience that he is a\nmore than competent singer.\nThe film never relies on the use\nof flashbacks to convey the pain the\ncharacters are going through. It relies\nheavily on actors\u2019 long speeches, them\nreminiscing about the tough days\nthey had. Kline has plenty of these,\nand nails every single one of them.\nHis smooth transition from slapstick,\ndorky comedy in the beginning, to the\nmore grounded, deeply heartbroken\nversion of his character in the film\u2019s\nsecond half is an impressive one,\nand it is through him My Old Lady\nmanages to resonate emotionally.\nAn unwise decision of forcing a\nlove story between the two singles\nnever sits right. Kline and Thomas\nare supposed to connect through their\nshared pains of having had a difficult\nchildhood. Kline\u2019s role is well-established, but the limited one here\nis Thomas\u2019. She is a brilliant actress,\nand there are hints of what Chlo\u00e9\nwent through living with Mathilde,\nbut too little time is invested in\nthe crucial female counterpart to\nMathias, that the attraction the two\nof them share, appear more contrived\nthan anything else.\nEverything is deceptively simple.\nThe atmosphere, the characters, even\nthe trailer sells this as a light-hearted\nromantic comedy. But the reality is\nthat My Old Lady sets out to delve\na little deeper, exploring themes of\nfinally growing up, coming to terms\nwith childhood trauma, and trying to\nlead a happy life in spite of the past.\nMY OLD LADY\nDirector: Israel Horovitz\nScreenplay: Israel Horovitz\nCast: Kevin Kline, Kristin Scott\nThomas, Maggie Smith\nPhoto: Israel Horovitz/BBC Films\n\"The\nmessage\nit wants\nto convey\nis clear.\nChildren\nof broken\nhomes can\nbe more\ndamaged\nthan they\nare willing\nto admit.\"\nNO GOOD DEED\nDirector: Sam Miller\nScreenplay: Aimee Lagos\nCast: Idris Elba, Taraji P.\nHenson, Leslie Bibb\nPhoto: Sam Miller/Screen Gems\nPhoto: Sam Miller/Screen Gems\nGiven the temporary obsession\nthat swept across the media\nover the \u2018sexy felon\u2019 Jeremy\nMeeks, it would appear that the\nscenario of No Good Deed is not at\nall an implausible one. A housewife\nwho is staying home alone whilst\nher husband is away playing golf,\nis taken aback by a hunky stranger\nwho appears on her doorstep. After\nsome initial hesitation, she lets the\nman in. And what does she do in\nthe bathroom? She checks her hair\nto see whether she looks okay and\npresentable to\nBut little does she know that this\ncharismatic man, Colin (Idris Elba),\nis in fact an escaped convict, and\nthe first thing he did after running\naway, was to strangle his ex-fianc\u00e9e to\ndeath. But Terry (Taraji P. Henson),\na mother of two young children who\nis lacking passion in her marriage,\nwelcomes him in out of the goodness\nof her heart. There is some harmless\nchit-chat, to get to know one another,\nand even a hint of a little flirtation.\nTerry\u2019s friend Meg (Leslie Bibb) comes\nover, who openly advances on the tall,\ndark, handsome man.\nIt spends more than its fair share\nof time in setting the scene, and the\npromised thrills do not come until\ntoo late. The brooding, tough-looking\nElba certainly succeeds in setting\nthe tone for things to come. He is\nmentally unstable to say the least, and\nto have someone like Elba portray\na highly volatile, violent man is a\ngenius bit of casting. His physically\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\n\"To have\nsomeone\nlike Elba\nportray\na highly\nvoltaile,\nviolent\nman is a\ngenius bit\nof casting.\"\nimposing stature to begin with, is a\nthreatening presence from the get-go,\nand the stark contrast between his\ndeadly calm delivery of certain lines\nand his full-on rage mode are what\nkeep the narrative exciting.\nDespite having the formidable\ntalent of Elba playing the villain, the\nwriting and sequence of events that\nfollow in the film\u2019s more action-packed part is a let-down. A lot of\nwhat Colin does makes no sense\nand is downright idiotic. There\nare so many ways out of the sticky\nsituation he finds himself in, and yet\nthe man who escapes from prison\nhas difficulty taking care of a single\nmother and her two children. Elba is\nof course required to show some flesh,\nincluding a particularly silly shower\nscene which, if it were happening\nwith a female character, feminists\nand critics alike would scream\nunnecessary, gratuitous nudity.\nThat Colin makes so many mistakes\nworks as an advantage for Terry,\nplayed with ferocious determination\nby Henson. Her character is\nessentially summed up as a mother\ndoing whatever she can to protect her\nfamily. She mentions that she worked\nas a prosecutor, although this little\ndetail does not add much to the plot.\nIt all starts heating up in ways you\nwould expect things to. It is a standard\nhome invasion thriller, and yes, it\nmakes the daring move of using two\nhouses instead of just the traditional\none, but the way the heroine survives\nand clings on for dear life offers up\nnothing special. Terry is a remarkably\nresourceful lady, with so many things\nfalling exactly into the right place for\nher to use as deadly weapons, and she\ncheats death many times. In fact, so\ndoes Colin on multiple occasions, but\nthese characters are required to defy\nscience and the force of gravity, for\nthe sake of continuing with the film\u2019s\nstory.\nWhen Terry starts fighting back is\narguably the most entertaining part\nof the film, but it is a shame this is all\ncrammed into the final few minutes.\nEssentially what it boils down to is\ntwo overqualified actors being part of\nan underdeveloped thriller, much like\nanother one of Elba\u2019s film, Obsessed.\n\n"

The Ellen\nDeGeneres\u2019 selfie from the 2014\nAcademy Awards has the honour\nof being the most retweeted image\nin the world; Instagram has over\n50 million picture with the tag\n#selfie; and the phenomenon even\nhas its own theme song \u2013 #SELFIE\nby The Chainsmokers, a piece of\nsomewhat dubious quality. Truly,\nour society is saturated with the selfie\nphenomenon.\nHowever, if you need reminding\nthat sometimes the best subjects in\nphotography are other people, you\ncould do worse than head down to\nthe National Portrait Gallery, where\nthe Taylor Wessing Photographic\nPortrait Prize, now in its twelfth\niteration, is currently on display.\nShowcasing the best photo portraits\ntaken in the last year, its 4000 entries\nhave been whittled down to just 60,\nfrom which one has been crowned the\nwinner.\nThe names on display here are\nvaried, from well-established\nphotographers such as Giles Price,\nwho shows director Steve McQueen\nstaring a hole through the lens, to\ncompletely new artists, something\nthat is surely a direct result of the\nfact that all entries are judged blind.\nAt first glance, it may seem that the\nthemes explored are equally varied,\nbut careful viewing reveals a number\nof key ideas that the photographers\nrepeatedly come back to.\nOne such idea is that of identity,\nwhich should be no surprise \u2013\nafter all, what is a portrait if not\na form of identification? Mark\nRead\u2019s photographs of the Sapeurs\nof Brazzaville \u2013 Congolese men\nwho dress as dandies as a form of\nresistance against colonialism \u2013 are\nsuperb, exploring a topic that has a\nreal power and resonance in today\u2019s\nglobalised world; his sapeur is dressed\nto the nines, clad in an expensive-looking suit against a backdrop\nof the waterfront of the DRC\u2019s\ncapital, looking like one of the latest\ncandidates on The Apprentice.\nElsewhere, Sara Al Obaidly\u2019s\nportrait of her young Qatari cousins\nperfectly encapsulate the sartorial\ndrama currently occurring in the\nMiddle East, where old and new\ncultures are clashing like jungle\ndrums; part of her series Qatar: Old\nHearts, New World, the formal\nrigidity of her sitters\u2019 poses is offset\nby the bow one of the girls wears in\nher hair \u2013 branded with the Chanel\nlogo, it contrasts brilliantly with her\nall black ensemble. It forms a perfect\ncompanion piece to Jessica FulfordDobson\u2019s work Skate Girl, which\nwon second prize in the competition;\nin this series, Fulford-Dobson\ndocumented the young Afghan\ngirls who learn to skate through the\nNGO Skateistan. Both challenge the\nWestern idea of the Middle East,\nand question the cultural values\nassociated with the region.\nElsewhere, the role of artifice\nis explored, such as in Catherine\nBalet\u2019s reproduction of Diane Arbus\nphotographs, or Hayley Benoit\u2019s\nportrait Jamelia as her mum, Olivia,\nin which her friend dons the garbs\nof her mother, linking together the\ndifferent generations. Her head held\nhigh, mouth creasing into a golden\nsmile, Jamelia is completely uplifting,\nand Benoit\u2019s work is one of the most\noptimistic in the gallery.\nHowever, there is a dichotomy\nwithin the collection of photos;\nthere are those that photograph\ntheir friends, or family, and those\nwho choose famous individuals\nas their subjects. In general, it is\nthe former that come out on top;\nwith no pressure to represent a\nwell-known figure in a certain way,\nthese photographers have been\nable to pierce to the core of their\nsubjects. A black and white portrait\nof a Columbian drag queen, taken by\nViviana Peretti, manages to elegantly\nbreak down notions of gender and\nsexuality, like a cross between Irving\nPenn and Cindy Sherman; Marcia\nMichael photographs her mother\nundressing, creating a vision of soft\nflesh that transcends the normal\ntropes of race and sex; and Sammi\nParkkinen\u2019s portrait of his son, Arvi,\nwearing an oversized coat, manages to\nbe both tender and heartbreaking.\nAn absolute highlight is Nicholas\nSinclair\u2019s portrait of British artist\nCelia Paul, at home in her studio;\nset next to a portrait of her sister,\nit is a picture within a picture, and\nmanages to conjure up an atmosphere\nof extreme intimacy. The silent\nstillness of the picture reflects the\nsolemnity of the artist\u2019s studio: a\nmagical, mysterious realm in which\nthe painter \u2013 like a body possessed\n\u2013 conjures up spirits of creativity,\ncontaining them within the blank\ncage of a canvas. It is one of the best\nphotos in the space, both haunting\nand beautiful.\nOn the other hand, there are\npictures whose subjects are more\ninteresting than their compositions.\nThe aforementioned portrait of\nSteve McQueen is admittedly\ntechnically accomplished, but says\nlittle about McQueen as a person. Jon\nCartwright\u2019s portrait of Roger LloydPack is similarly unimaginative,\nresembling a headshot of any\nactor that one could see in their\nportfolio. However, the award for\nthe most distressing interpretation\nof a celebrity comes from Bert\nVerwelius: Maria, which shows a\nmember of Russian protest group\n\"Careful\nviewing\nreveals a\nnumber\nof key\nideas that\nthe artists\nexplore\"\nPussy Riot unmasked, resembles\na portrait of a ballet dancer upon\nwhich an overenthusiastic Photoshop\ntechnician has trained their gaze.\nWith a panache that would make\nAnna Wintour blush, Verwelius has\nmanaged to rob his subject not only\nof any individuality, but also her\nnose.\nThis year\u2019s winner, David Titlow,\npresent us with a photograph of\nhis infant son, being shown with a\ndog the morning after a night-long\nmidsummer party in Sweden. The\ncomposition is bathed within a\nmagical light, the kind that can only\nbe found at a certain time of day, and\nresembles nothing short of a classical\nRembrandt. With beer cans instead of\ngolden cups, septum piercings instead\nof golden chains, it is a newfound\nmasterpiece; an adoration of the magi\nfor our modern world.\nWith any exhibition that invites\nsubmissions from the general\npopulation, there will be a mix of\nquality; this is certainly the case at\nthe Taylor Wessing Photographic\nPortrait Prize, where inspired\nworks rub shoulders with the less\nimaginative. Ultimately though,\nthe selection is very well made,\nencompassing a myriad of themes:\nidentity, gender, artifice - they all get\na look in at this show. And if nothing\nelse, the surrounding spectacle of\nTrafalgar Square should provide a\nperfect backdrop for a quick selfie.\nThe Taylor Wessing Photographic\nPortrait Prize is on until 22nd February\n2015, at the National Portrait Gallery.\nTickets \u00a33 adults, \u00a32 students\nSkate Girl by Jessica Fulford-Dobson\nPhoto: Jessica Fulford-Dobson\nKonrad Lars Hastings Titlow, by David Titlow Photo: David Titlow\n\n"

Photo: ESA\nstudies the earth\u2019s magnetic field,\nwe have to deal with all that plus the\nextra radiation from the van Allen\nbelts of charged particles.\nThe temperature is extremely\nlow, and that\u2019s a challenge, but the\nradiation environment isn\u2019t too bad.\nWhat will be a big challenge is the\ndust and gas.\nWe usually think of a spacecraft\nin a vacuum. In this case, the comet\nwill boil off gas and dust from below\nthe surface. The real challenge for\nRosetta is that this will collect on\nthe orbiter and create drag. Usually\nNewton\u2019s laws will tell you exactly\nwhere a spacecraft will be, but this\nextra drag makes Rosetta\u2019s motion\nunpredictable.\nHow do you go about designing\nan instrument to send into deep\nspace?\nIf we want to measure particles or\na magnetic field, the instrument\ntechnology is pretty well developed.\nParticle detectors for use in the lab\nare relatively easy things to make.\nIf we want to send an instrument\ninto space, we\u2019re trying to measure\nextremely small magnetic fields\nand plasma densities (about 1-2\nnanotesla (compared with 40-50\non earth), so we need very sensitive\ninstruments. They have to be very\nhigh quality, but also very robust\nto survive the rocket launch and\nextreme cold.\nThe key thing though is reliability.\nAlmost uniquely for a piece of\ninstrumentation, we can\u2019t just go\nup and fix it if something goes\nwrong. We use a lot of military-grade electronic components with\nguaranteed reliability and radiation\nhardness. This also makes things\nvery expensive \u2014 for Rosetta, each\nchip costs around $10,000. And to\nensure reliability, there\u2019s a lot of\nredundancy built in so if one fails we\nalways have a back up.\nWhat have you been doing for the\npast 10 years while Rosetta was\ntravelling to the comet?\nIt hasn\u2019t been entirely dormant\nwhilst we\u2019ve been flying there. There\nwas some data to be taken while we\nwere flying past Earth, Mars and\ntwo asteroids. All instruments were\noperational in those periods, being\ntested and helping us prepare for the\nrendezvous.\nAt Imperial, we\u2019ve also been\nheavily involved in programmes like\nCassini and Cluster. Rosetta was a\npart-time project, but it\u2019s suddenly\nbecome very busy.\nHow closely have you been\nworking with other groups?\nThe plasma consortium is a big team\nalready, with people involved from\nright across Europe and the US. We\ndo work with other teams though,\nparticularly the magnetometer\non the lander, so we can compare\nour measurements with them.\nThere\u2019s also a mass spectrometer,\nand an instrument on the orbiter\ncalled ROSINA, which investigates\nneutral gases and ions. There are\nbig meetings with all three groups\n\u2014 the next one\u2019s in three weeks \u2014\nwhere we share our findings and see\nhow measurements from different\ninstruments can support each other.\nHas the mission gone as you\nexpected when you first started\nworking on the project?\nActually it has really. The goal\nof Rosetta was to make the\nfirst rendezvous with a comet,\ncharacterise it in orbit and send the\nlander down, and we achieved that.\nEveryone thought it was a bit of a\ncrazy idea. To rendezvous would be\nhard, to land would be even harder.\nNASA\u2019s Comet Rendezvous was\ncancelled because of the difficulties\ninvolved, but the ESA persevered.\nAcross the project there\u2019s been a\nfeeling that it was hard but we did it.\nWhat else are groups at Imperial\nworking on at the moment?\nI\u2019m the principal investigator (PI)\nfor the magnetometer on Cluster,\nwhich keeps me occupied most\nof the time. I also run the Space\nMagnetometer Lab here. Groups\nfrom Imperial are working on\nplanned missions: BepeColombo\nto Mercury and Solar Orbiter \u2014 the\nPI for that magnetometer is Tim\nHorbury. We\u2019ve recently been\nselected to build instruments for\nthe JUICE mission to Jupiter that\nMichele Dougherty will be working\non \u2014 a lot of the development for\nthat will be done at Imperial.\nWe\u2019re also working on CubeSats:\nminiature satellites to map the\nmagnetosphere using sensors similar\nto those you find as compasses\nin phones. They aim to relate the\nmagnetic field in low-earth with that\nmeasured by an array of ground-based detectors to see how the solar\nwind penetrates the earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield.\n\"The key\nthing\nthough is\nreliability.\u201d\n\"There's\nbeen a\nfeeling\nthat it was\nhard, but\nwe did it.\"\nMission\nMission\nMission\n\n"

Eugene Smith\n\"Men look\nat women.\nWomen\nwatch\nthemselves\nbeing\nlooked at\"\n\"Art\nbecame\nlittle\nmore than\ntitillating\nthe man in\npower\"\nIn 1984, the Museum of Modern\nArt in New York opened a new\nexhibition: \u2018An International\nSurvey of Recent Painting and\nSculpture\u2019. it promised to be a\nsurvey of the most important artists\ncurrently working in the art world.\nNot everyone was impressed. Out\nof the 169 works featured, only 13\nwere by women artists, a fact that was\nnot helped by the curator, Kynaston\nMcShine, saying that any artist not in\nthe show should rethink his career. In\n1985, one year after the show opened,\nthe Guerrilla Girls were formed by\nseven women artists. And the rest, as\nthey say, is history.\nTheir most famous work is\nimmediately arresting; on a yellow\nbackground, bold black text screams:\n\u201cDo women have to be naked to get\ninto the Met Museum? Less than\n5% of the artists in the Modern Art\nSections are women, but 85% of the\nnudes are female\u201d. Offset with an\nimage of Ingres\u2019 painting La Grande\nOdalisque, where the woman\u2019s head\nhas been replaced with a gorilla,\ntheir statement is immediately clear;\nwomen are under-represented in art\ngalleries, except where they are the\nsubject of the Male Gaze.\nThe Male Gaze was coined by\nfeminist film-theorist Laura Mulvey,\nwho saw it as a power structure\nbetween the sexes; with heterosexual\nmen in control of the palette, the\ncamera, the chisel, many works of\nart became little more than a means\nof titillating the man in power. In\neffect, most works of art put us in\nthe perspective of a straight man,\nmaking the woman a sexual object.\nThis is apparent throughout all of\nart history; one only needs to go and\nlook at the key painters of yore, and\ntheir key themes; for Rubens, Titian,\nVelazquez, the female nude was a\nnear-obsession.\nSince Mulvey, this idea has taken\non a life of its own. John Berger,\nwriting in Ways of Seeing, says that\nit infiltrates how men and women\nappear in society: \u201cMen look at\nwomen. Women watch themselves\nbeing looked at\u201d. In art, the woman\nis always aware of being the subject\nof the Male Gaze, and in Renaissance\npainting, would often be portrayed\nstaring into a mirror, admiring\nherself as an object of adoration.\nWhile the Male Gaze may be\nthe most famous example of the\nphenomenon of the \u2018Gaze\u2019, it is by no\nmeans the only form. It can be traced\nback to French psychoanalyst Jacques\nLacan, who defined it as the state\nthat comes with awareness that one\nis an object to be viewed. From this\nsomewhat nebulous definition, more\nand more academic disciplines have\nsprung up.\nWe have Foucault\u2019s Medical Gaze,\nwhere the patient becomes \u2018a mere\ntext through which disease can be\nread\u2019; there is the Colonial Gaze,\nwhich describes how the privileged\nmajority place that which is \u2018foreign\u2019\ninto the category of Other; and there\nis even the Female Gaze, which shows\nsuch as True Blood could be seen to\nuse.\nWhen those seven artist friends\ngot together in 1985, they probably\nhad little idea how much they would\nshock the art world. Taking on the\nnames of dead women artists such\nas K\u00e4the Kollwitz, they set out to\nchallenge the status quo of the day.\nWhile things have gotten better, they\nstill aren\u2019t perfect: women are still\nunderrepresented in the arts, both in\nthe market and the gallery. The work\nof the Guerrilla Girls thus continues,\nand will carry on until the Male Gaze\nhas been replaced with a much more\neven sight.\nEditorial: The\nGaze Issue\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nToo Many Firsts by Riyadh Rateme\nThis week is the Gaze Issue,where we\nlook at how we look.How do we view\nthe world? How does it affect our\nexperience of art?\nFirst of all,Fred Fyles gazes at the\nGuerilla Girls,the group famous for\nbringing to light the sexism intrinsic\nin art,the art market and in how we\nview the world in general.Read this\narticle.You should know about them\nand this bias in art.It will change\nyour visits to art galleries forever.\nAnd how perfectly illustrated was\nthe Guerilla Girls\u2019message by the\nAllen Jones Retrospective,an awful\nexhibition currently on at the Royal\nAcademy?

It has altered to decrease\nfunding for those from lower-income households and funding to\nincrease for those students from\nhouseholds who have slightly more\nmoney.\nThe decision, made by the Provost\nBoard at the end of October, was\nmade to alleviate the financial\npressures of those that come from\nhigher income families but may not\nhave guaranteed financial support.\nBursaries are awarded to Home\nstudents only, and are paid for\ndirectly by the College, alongside\nthe grants and loans on offer from\nthe UK Government. Only the loans\nhave to be repaid; the grants and\nbursaries go straight into the pockets\nof the students, and they don\u2019t have\nto pay it back at a later date.\nThe Union Council quickly\nmoved to \u201ccondemn\u201d the decision,\nand College was quick to respond\nas to why they made the changes.\nCollege secretary & Registrar John\nNeilson spoke to Felix to explain the\ndecision.\nSaid Neilson: \u201cIn the summer the\nprevious team of Union sabbatical\nofficers had prepared a thoughtful\npaper suggesting that students who\ncome from households just higher\nthan the lowest income bandings\nwere facing the hardest time\nfinancially at Imperial.\n\u201cThe last Provost\u2019s Board\nconsidered the package of bursary\nsupport to be made available to\nhome undergraduates starting in\nautumn 2016. We were keen to\nmake the substantial sum available\nfor such bursaries (some \u00a37.7m) as\nuseful as possible to students.\u201d\nFurther concerns were raised\nover current Union President Tom\nWheeler having only been granted\na small window of time to consult\nstudents. The decision was made\nduring the second half of October,\nwith Tom Wheeler being given the\n\u201cgo-ahead\u201d to survey students the\nscheme from the 16th. By the 31st,\nthe Provost Board had met and\ndecided on the scheme, which was\nthen presented to Union Council\nin Wheeler\u2019s paper on the 11th\nNovember.\nWhen Felix asked directly as\nto why Imperial College Union\u2019s\nconsultation framework wasn\u2019t used\nto make the decision, all that College\nsaid was that: \u201cIn the time available\nbefore the new undergraduate\nprospectus was finalised there was\ntime to gather very wide range of\nviews from students.\n\u201cIt should be noted that the\nchanges will not affect current\nstudents; they will apply to new\nentrants from 2016-17.\u201d\nWheeler did endeavour to consult\nthose students who currently are\nin attendance at Imperial, despite\nsuch a decision not affecting them.\nWheeler surveyed 320 students, held\na discussion forum and also emailed\nthose who received bursaries directly\nto gather their views. In the survey,\nhe queried whether current students\nwho receive bursaries feel they get\nenough money to live on, and any\nother sources of income students\nmay have.\nWith 73% of respondents saying\nthat they found the money they\nreceived to be adequate, good or very\ngood, many seemed to be happy with\nthe current bursary scheme.\nHowever some students who were\nsurveyed did point out that although\nhousehold income indicates the\namount of money they receive as\nloans, grants and bursaries, parents\nare often unable to make up the\ndifference in money needed for\nstudents to live on. Students from\nthe higher income brackets were\nmore likely to feel they did not\nreceive enough financial support as\na whole, something the College has\nappeared to address with an increase\nin funding for these students in\nparticular.\nIn a report to the Provost Board,\nTom stated that: \u201cOur immediate\nreaction to this proposal was concern\nthat reducing income for the poorest\nstudents would lead to unnecessary\nhardship, and would not be the most\nefficient use of College\u2019s resources.\u201d\nThe report continued: We are\nThe new changes to bursary allocations per household income. The red bars show the new bursary allocations for 2016 entry\n\"Our\nimmediate\nreaction\nto this\nproposal\nwas\nconcern\"\n- Tom\nWheeler\n\u201cThe\nProvost\u2019s\nBoard\ncould\nat least\npretend\nto treat\nstudents\nas equal\npartners\nin their\neducation.\u201d\n- Council\nmember\n\n"

Well look no further\nthan this guide, my Lunchtime Guide\nto Art, which tells you about all the\namazing galleries and museums that\nare on offer within a stone\u2019s throw of\nImperial\u2019s South Kensington campus.\nAnd it is quite extraordinary; I can\u2019t\nimagine there are many universities\nwhere you can walk five minutes\ndown the road, see one of the world\u2019s\nbest art collections and still be back\nin time for lectures to start again an\nhour later.\nImperial College Blyth\nGallery\nTucked away and thus often missed\nis our very own art gallery, an\nidyll of tranquility away from the\nhubbub of university life below. The\nBlyth Gallery on the 5th\nFloor of\nthe Sherfield Building is the perfect\nrespite, even just for a fifteen-minute\ndetour from your lecture schedule.\nFree and open 9am \u2018til 9pm seven\ndays a week, you can really visit\nwhenever you want. From Ritual to\nRomance, a new solo exhibition by\nartist Chris Shaw runs from 27th\nNovember to 8th\nJanuary and shall\ndisplay a rich melding of symbolism\nold and new, putting ancient imagery\nin the context of our popular culture;\nit\u2019s sure to be exciting and maybe\neven a bit provocative.\nNatural History Museum\nIt is hard not to be aware of the huge\nbrute of a building at the end of our\nsacred Exhibition Road, the National\nHistory Museum. Although more\nthought of for its earthquake\nsimulator than its exhibition space,\nthe Museum does run a wonderful\nannual photography competition.\nNow in its 50th year, the Wildlife\nPhotographer of the Year prize, which\nruns until 30th\nAugust, 2015, is\ntruly a celebration of the beauty\nof our natural world, altering our\nperspective on the narratives of\ncertain species through the use of\nbreathtaking photography. Although\nnot free like some of the others (\u00a36.30\nfor a student), I would still thoroughly\nrecommend it. Open daily 10.00-17.15\nRoyal Geographic Society\nOften forgotten about in favour\nof its more famous cousins down\nthe other end of Exhibition Road,\nthe Royal Geographic Society\nis a wonderful institution and\nregularly holds exhibitions that\ncombine art with a sense of travel\nor exploration. Such a show is\nstarting on 1st\nDecember \u2013 India\u2019s\nDisappearing Railways \u2013 which runs\nuntil 9th\nJanuary; a free retrospective\nof Australian photographer Angus\nMcDonald\u2019s final works, it explores\nhow the Indian railway system is\nslowly disappearing as the country\nmodernizes and how this change will\naffect all the people who rely on it\nfor their livelihood, a beautiful and\nmoving collection of photos.\nChristie\u2019s Auction House\nA slightly more unusual option\nfor lunchtime art is the Christie\u2019s\nAuction House on Old Brompton\nRoad. Experience the glamour of the\nart market for free by going to one\nof their auctions or alternatively\njust a viewing on what is for sale in\nthe coming days. You may not have\nheard of any of the artists on show\n(all the big name sales happen at their\nMayfair branch) but a visit here will\ncertainly give you a sense of an aspect\nof the art world that you are not\nusually exposed to.\nHowever, it\u2019s still probably\ngoing to be out of your price range\nunless you\u2019ve got a few thousand\npounds knocking about! Upcoming\nauctions include one of British\npre-Raphaelite and Impressionist\nart on 26th\nNovember and one on\nBritish watercolour on 2nd\nDecember,\nwith viewings of the works on the\npreceding days for both.\nCadogan Contemporary\nGallery\nRight next door to Christie\u2019s is one\nof South Kensington\u2019s few private\nart galleries. Free as ever, it is\nexhibiting, from 17th November to\n3rd December, Janette Kerr\u2019s New\nWork from the Sea, a Turner-esque\ncollection of swirling seascapes,\nfull of energy and vitality \u2013 a great\nopportunity to discover a less known\nbut no less exquisite artist. Open MonFri 10.00-18.00, Sat 11.00-18.00\nMichael Hoppen Gallery\nAnother free private gallery, this\ntime just off King\u2019s Road on Jubilee\nPlace, the Michael Hoppen Gallery\nis currently showing the work of\nJapanese artist Sohei Nishino, New\nDioramas. Running until 7th\nJanuary,\nthe show builds off Nishino\u2019s\nprevious success with his New York\nand London dioramas to create ones\nof other great cities, Berlin, Rio and\nTokyo to name a few. In a mixture of\nphotography and cartography, the\ndioramas are not meant to give you\na geographically accurate depiction\nbut portray the sense of a place, its\npersonality, its quirks, its beauty.\nNishino spends months in these\ncities, exploring them to gain a sense\nof their unique features. Then he\nphotographs them, meticulously\nconstructing a patchwork collage that\nleaves you utterly immersed in this\nunorthodox but enlightened way of\nportraying places. Wonderful! Open\nMon-Fri 09.30-18.00, Sat 10.30-17.00\nSaatchi Gallery\nAbout a 20 minute walk from campus\nis the famous Saatchi Gallery,\nlocated at the Sloane Square end\nof Kings Road. With free entry\nto all exhibitions as well as free\nmembership and all associated perks,\nthe gallery is definitely worth a visit.\nAn upcoming show that I am very\nmuch looking forward to is Post Pop:\nEast Meets West (26th\nNovember, 2014\n\u2013 23rd\nFebruary, 2015), which explores\nthe impact the influential but deeply\nconsumerist Pop Art movement had\non the Communist countries of the\nEast, such as the USSR and China,\nwith surprising and often strikingly\nbeautiful effect, an effect that is still\nbeing felt to this day. Open every day\n10.00-18.00\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nThe V&A really is the artistic crown\njewels of the area and if I were to\nadvise you to go to only one of these\nart spaces, I would recommend this\none. Opposite the Natural History\nMuseum on Exhibition Road, it has\nan awesome collection of artefacts\nfrom all around the world, whether\nyou\u2019re interested in Chinese, Indian\nor some other country\u2019s art. It also\nhas some cracking exhibitions on at\nthe moment: Wedding Dresses 1775-2014 (Until 15th\nMarch) tracing the\nhistory of this most iconic piece of\nfashion and Constable: The Making of a\nMaster (Until 11th\nJanuary) examining\nConstable\u2019s groundbreaking new take\non landscape painting, to name but\ntwo. And whilst you do have to pay\nfor entry to the special exhibitions,\nthere\u2019s enough free stuff in the\npermanent collection to keep you\nbusy for days on end!

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 31\n21.11.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Lacklustre Show from the Father of Misogyny\nIf we look up the work\n\u2018Objectification\u2019 in the dictionary,\nit will tell us that it describes\n\u201ctreating a living person as a thing,\nwith no regard to their dignity\u201d.\nIt appears that Allen Jones has\nmisinterpreted this meaning. At\nleast, that\u2019s how things appear when\nentering the retrospective of his work\ncurrently being held at the Royal\nAcademy, where one is immediately\nfaced with a semi-naked mannequin,\nclad in leather and staring passively\ndown, supporting a large glass table-top on her back.\nIn this piece \u2013 Table, from 1969\n\u2013 Jones has quite literally turned\nthe female form into an object to\nbe exploited, abused, and vilified;\nit is a theme that runs through\nan exhibition that, rather than\nchampioning Jones as the enfant-terrible of British art, only reveals the\nextent of the deep-rooted misogyny\nthat has permeated his work for the\nlast 40 years. The curator, Edith\nDevaney, has promised that \u201call\nthe [opinions on Jones\u2019 work] are\ndiscussed here\u201d, and yet it is difficult\nto approach his art in any way that\ndiminishes its outrageous sexism.\nTable forms one third of a group of\nsculptures that caused controversy\nwhen exhibited in 1970; the other\ntwo, Hatstand and Chair, follow a\nsimilar theme of turning women into\nhousehold objects. Since their debut\nthey have, unsurprisingly, received a\ngreat deal of attention from feminist\ncampaigners for their toxicity; the\ngroundbreaking feminist magazine\nSpare Rib suggested that Jones was\nterrified of women, and just last week\nThe Guardian ran a piece entitled\n\u201cIs Allen Jones\u2019 sculpture the most\nsexist art ever?\u201d. Part of great art is\nits ability to shock, and Jones has\nexpressed his surprise at the outrage\nhis sculptures caused, saying that\nthey weren\u2019t intended to shock the\ngeneral public, but instead \u201cto shock\nArt\u201d, and make a return to figurative\nsculpture. It seems a pity that Mr\nJones had to exploit women\u2019s bodies\nin order to make his nebulous \u2018point\u2019,\nand by saying that he was surprised\nby the outcry he reveals himself as\neither incredibly naive or completely\ndeceptive.\nPart of the problem with Jones\u2019\nbody of work is that these three\nsculptures have dominated all\nconversation of his work; in this\narticle thus far they have already\ntaken up over 300 words. The rest\nof the exhibition, which presents all\nof Jones\u2019 oeuvre, tends to fare a little\nbetter as far as offensive material\ngoes, although his obsession with\ndeconstructing the female form is\npresent throughout; in his paintings\nfrom 1966-67, he obsessively draws\ndisembodied women\u2019s legs, while in\nother works women are separated\ninto mere limbs and torsos, floating\nin a colourful void.\nSome of Jones\u2019 early work is very\nimpressive, with his use of colour\nstanding out as masterful; in one\npiece, The Sitter (1966) we have blue\nfading into verdant green, which then\nbecomes crimson against egg-yolk\nyellow. His use of tones and hues\nare without equal, creating visually\narresting paintings that still look\nfresh today, and reveal his links to\nAmerican abstract expressionism. It\nis a pity then, that the subject matter\nremains so bland, with The Sitter\ndepicting a tableaux in which women\nsprawl, legs akimbo, feet stiletto-ed,\nfawning in front of disinterested\nmen. It is especially sad when\ncompared to his earliest work, such as\nhis \u2018Buses\u2019 series from the early 60\u2019s,\nin which he dynamically explores\nthe limits of both his use of colour,\nand the canvas as a physical medium.\nThese works are fun, dynamic, and\noptimistic, which makes it even more\nof a pity that his other works are just\nrehashes of the same old tropes.\nIn many of the pictures we see\nwomen either completely naked, in\na state of undress, or constricted in\nfetish-wear; a great number of the\npaintings feature a \u2018man in control\u2019.\nThis may be a magician, sawing a\nglamorous woman in half. It may\nbe a conductor, wielding a baton of\npower. In nearly all the cases the man\nis fully dressed, making the woman\u2019s\nnakedness even more degrading \u2013\nRobin Thicke eat your heart out,\nAllen Jones got here first.\nAll this being said, there are some\nstunning works in the gallery. Jones\nhas spoken about his \u2018three languages\u2019\nof work: Painting, Sculpture, and\nSteel. It is this last medium in which\nhe comes closest to transcending the\nlabel of sexist that plagues his other\nwork. Using sheets of brightly painted\nmetal, Jones has created a series of\ncouples dancing: over here a foxtrot,\nover there a waltz. These pieces\nexude confidence, levity, and \u2013 well\n\u2013 sexiness; it is as if the figures have\ncome straight off the canvas, and\nare whirling around the exhibition\nspace. With their complex spatial\narrangement and sense of jollity,\nthey are by far the best work in the\nretrospective \u2013 Naum Gabo with a\nBrighton-postcard sensibility.\nEntering the final room\nextinguishes any joy obtained from\nthe previous pieces; here, in what\nwas supposed to be an explosive\nculmination of Jones\u2019 work, there\nis assembled a \u2018chorus-line\u2019 of his\nstatic mannequin work. Dead,\nglassy eyes stare out at you from\nbehind false lashes, giving the whole\nensemble about as much appeal as a\nfishmongers. The guide says that the\nfine detailing and attention to detail\n\u201caffords [these sculptures] status, as\nif they should be observed on a stage\nor a pedestal\u201d. The only place I can\nimaging placing these sculptures is\non the trash heap along with Page 3,\nPeter Stringfellow, and everything\nelse that should have died a death\nsometime in the mid-70\u2019s.\nUltimately, Allen Jones, rather than\nexalting women, robs them of their\nagency. Defenders of his work would\nsay that Jones is simply making fun\nof male sexual desire, and yet the\nsheer tenacity with which he returns\nto the subject suggests that there is\na deeper obsession with debasing\nHat Stand, 1969, by Allen Jones Photo: Allen Jones\nThe long-awaited Allen Jones Retrospective is analysed by Fred Fyles\n\"We have\na chance\nto see all\nof Jones'\noeuvre; the\nquestion is\nwhy would\nwe want to\"\nUltimately\nJones,\nrather than\nexalting\nwomen,\nrobs them\nof their\nagency\nwomen that runs straight to his core.\nSuch subject matter can be used as a\nform of female empowerment: just\nlook at the paintings of artist Ella\nKruglyanskaya, who explores the\nfemale form with a joyous gaze - the\nwomen in her work aren\u2019t powerless;\nthey are strong, confident, and above\nall in control. Jones work doesn\u2019t\ncompare. Instead it sits alongside the\nwork of other serial misogynists such\nas Mel Ramos, whose work claims\nto be subverting the male gaze, but\ninstead just reinforces it.\nEdith Devaney has spoken about\nhow they decided not to show the\nthree furniture sculptures together,\nsince they wanted to take the focus\naway from the most well known\npieces, and instead show work that\nisn\u2019t usually seen. In that regard\nthe retrospective is a success, giving\nviewer a chance to see the entire\noeuvre of Allen Jones; the question is,\nwhy would they want to? Ultimately\nit reveals Jones to be an artist whose\nwork shows no lack of skill, but a\nsevere dearth of ideas. Devaney has\nlauded Jones\u2019 decision to dress his\nsculptures in fetish-wear, since if\nhe has dressed them in fashions of\nthe time they would appear dated;\nbut it is not the clothes that seem\nold-fashioned, just the archaic\nattitudes towards women that \u2013 like\na poisonous mould \u2013 colonise every\nroom of this exhibition.\nAllen Jones is on at The Royal\nAcademy, until 25th\nJanuary.

I was\nfirst involved in 1997. Our group is\ninterested in space physics, making\nmeasurments of plasmas, particles\nand magnetic fields. At the time I\nwas working on Cluster \u2014 a project\nto map the earth\u2019s magnetic field.\nWhen the ESA was looking into\nRosetta, they wanted a team to run\nthe magnetometer, and they came\nto us because of our experience on\nCluster.\nMy Principal Investigator,\nAndre Balogh, got involved and\ncame together with other groups\nto develop the instrumentation\npackage, with Imperial as the main\ndata processing centre. I later\nbecame the lead at Imperial.\nWhat is Rosetta trying to\nachieve that couldn\u2019t be done by\ntelescopes or previous spacecraft?\nRosetta isn\u2019t the first mission to\na comet \u2014 there have been quite a\nfew. The most famous is the Giotto\nmission to Halley in 1986, but there\nwere two others in the same year:\na Russian and a Japanese mission,\nwhich were looking at the comet as\nit was close to the sun, boiling off\nlots of gas and dust and making a\nbig spectacle. They flew through\nthis cloud, the coma of the comet, at\nabout 10km/s, in just a few hours.\nWhat Rosetta is doing is\nfundamentally different. It\u2019s no\nlonger a fly-by mission as it\u2019s in\nthe same orbit as the comet and\nwill travel with it, observing its\nevolution over a whole year as it\nboils off dust and gas. We needed\n10 years to get there as we had to\nget gravity assists from Mars and\nJupiter in order to match the speed\nof the comet.\nRosetta will also be making in\nsitu measurements of its chemical\ncomposition. You can\u2019t use\ninstrumentation on earth if you\nwant to sample what the comet is\nmade of and investigate the dust and\ngas coming off it.\nYour group works on the\nmagnetometers on the Rosetta\norbiter. What are you trying to\nfind out with this instrument?\nWe\u2019ve been involved with\nmagnetometers on other space\nmissions, particularly Cluster and\nVenus Express, and will be building\nthe magnetometer for Solar Orbiter,\nthe BepiColombo mission to\nMercury, and the JUICE mission to\nJupiter.\nThe magnetometer on Rosetta was\nbuilt in Germany. What we built is\nthe \u2018brain\u2019 and the power supply for\nthe whole consortium that connects\nthe 5 plasma sensors. There\u2019s also\na separate magnetometer on the\nlander, Philae, run by a different\ngroup.\nWe don\u2019t know much about the\nmagnetic field around a comet,\nalthough it won\u2019t be very strong.\nYou have a magnetic field from the\nsun and solar wind, which drown out\nany signal you\u2019d get from the comet.\nWhen the comet starts boiling off\nlots of dust and water molecules,\nthe particles coming off get ionised\nby UV radiation from the sun. This\ncreates lots of highly conductive\nplasma around the comet, which\nshield off the solar wind. This\nshould let us see how the comet\u2019s\nmagnetosphere develops. We hope\nto compare these magnetic field\nmeasurements with those from the\nlander to see what this can tell us\nabout the nucleus.\nHave you discovered anything\ninteresting so far?\nWe\u2019ve seen two things that we\nweren\u2019t expecting.\nWater molecules boil off the\ncomet and are ionised by solar UV\nradiation. These ions should gyrate\nand produce a magnetic field with\na characteristic frequency. We\u2019ve\nseen a frequency much lower than\nwe expected \u2014 about 30-50mHz.\nThis doesn\u2019t really fit with our\nunderstanding of how ionised water\nmolecules should behave.\nAs well as that, we\u2019ve seen low\nenergy water ions coming directly\nfrom the comet at thermal speeds,\nas expected. We\u2019ve also seen some\nat much higher energy. We think\nthey have actually drifted past the\nspacecraft and been pushed back by\nthe solar wind \u2014 they can achieve\nhigher energies because they\u2019ve had\nlonger to be accelerated.\nHow do you operate a spacecraft\nso far away from earth?\nIn principle it\u2019s run like any other\nmission. Emanuele Cupido is\nresponsible for communicating\nbetween our group and the ESA.\nWe have a set of protocols to\nsend command instructions that\nare prepared in advance. This is\nnecessary not only because it has\nto be carefully checked, but also\nbecause you don\u2019t have real-time\naccess. There is a half-hour delay\nin communication because of the\ndistances involved, and the limit\nimposed by the speed of light.\nFrom our perspective it\u2019s not\nmuch different to other missions.\nFrom the ESA\u2019s perspective though,\nit\u2019s very different because it\u2019s a deep\nspace mission, about 500 million\nkilometres away. You can only\ncommunicate using extremely large\nantennae, which requires dedicated\nfacilities. The ESA\u2019s are in Australia,\nbut we also share NASA\u2019s Deep Space\nNetwork.\nWhat challenges are there in\noperating an instrument for\nRosetta compared to something in\na lab on earth, or on a satellite in\norbit around the earth?\nThe earth orbit environment is\nusually worse. In deep space, we\nmostly have the constant radiation\nfrom the solar wind, but we also\nneed to deal with occasional solar\nflares and very high energy cosmic\nrays. On Cluster, a satellite that\n\"Rosetta\nwill stay\nwith the\ncomet\nover a\nwhole year\nas it boils\noff dust\nand gas.\"\n\"We've\nseen two\nthings\nthat we\nweren't\nexpecting.\"\nChris Carr, our resident comet chaser Photo: Imperial\nChris Carr talks to James Bezer on his\nrole in the Rosetta expedition and just\nhow hard it is to do science in space\n\u201cEveryone thought it was\na bit of a crazy idea.\u201d\n\n"

Sporting a round face and\nelegant design, it is one of this year\u2019s\nmost highly desired gadgets. At \u00a3199\nit\u2019s also one of the more expensive,\nbut the combination of Google\u2019s\nsoftware and Motorola\u2019s hardware\nmake it the smartwatch to buy.\nLet\u2019s start with the specs; the Moto\n360 has a 1.5 inch LCD circular\ndisplay, with a tiny bit cropped off\nto accommodate an ambient light\nsensor. It has a resolution of 320x290\npixels and is topped off with Gorilla\nGlass 3, meaning that the screen\nis tougher and has better viewing\nangles. An AMOLED display with a\nhigher resolution could have been\nan improvement, but as it is it\u2019s\nmore than sufficient for checking\nnotifications and running most apps.\nIt has a TI OMAP 3 CPU clocked\nat 1GHz, 512MB of RAM and 4GB\nstorage. There\u2019s also a pedometer,\noptical heart rate monitor, dual\nmicrophones and Bluetooth 4.0\nconnectivity. Powering the device is\na 320 mAh non-removable battery,\nwhich utilises the Qi wireless\ncharging standard.\nWith a stainless steel body, gorilla\nglass screen and leather strap, the\nMoto 360 doesn\u2019t just look like a\nwearable piece of technology; it\u2019s also\na fashionable timepiece. Weighing\nonly 49 grams, it actually feels like a\nwatch when wearing it on your wrist.\nThe main body only comes in\nblack and silver, but it is possible to\nbuy black, dark grey or light grey\nleather straps \u2013 all of which are\ninterchangeable (if you have a jeweler\nhandy to do it for you). There are also\nplans to release metal bands soon.\nThe watch is quite sizeable though,\ncoming in at 46mm wide and 11.5mm\nthick. It can be off-putting at first, but\nit quickly grows on you after regular\nuse.\nThe main draw of smartwatches\nis the software. Although still in its infancy, Android Wear holds up\nwell in day-to-day life. Whenever a\nnotification pops up on your phone,\na smaller version is shown on the\nwatch. The icons and text are exactly\nthe same and it\u2019s very easy to respond\nto messages by simple dictation. Of\ncourse the speech recognition isn\u2019t\nperfect, but it\u2019s good enough for most\ntasks such as replying to texts and\nperforming Google Now queries.\nYou could also make use of Android\nWear\u2019s voice commands. Writing\nnotes, checking Calendar and even\npersonal navigation are just some of\nthe things you could do right on your\nwrist.\nThere\u2019s also a whole suite of fitness\napps to track your heart rate and the\nnumber of steps you take in a day\namongst other things to optimise\nyour exercise experience. The heart\nrate sensor is quite cool when in\noperation; pointing green lasers\nat your wrists looking for signs of\nlife. However, after comparison\nwith a more professional heart rate\nmonitor, I found the 360\u2019s readings\nto be inconsistent and inaccurate.\nNonetheless, it is good enough for use\nas a rough guide.\nDespite having an older CPU\nsetup than its rivals, the 360 runs\nvery smoothly for the most part.\nNavigating the OS and using various\napps proves no problem at all for\nthe watch. An active display is in\neffect, so simply tapping the screen or\npressing the side button will wake the\ndevice. The only issue is that there\u2019s a\nbit of lag for the first split second that\nthe screen is on, but this is only really\nnoticeable after leaving the watch idle\nfor a long time.\nThe battery life of the watch\nwas very poor initially, barely\nscraping twenty-four hours. Since\nthen Motorola have released an\nupdate that drastically improves\nthe power usage and it now easily\nlasts more than a day. There\u2019s an\nambient screen option that keeps\nthe display permanently on, which\nwould obviously drain more battery.\nHowever, since the screen just\nlights up when you raise your wrist\nnaturally, I haven\u2019t noticed any\nbenefit to this. Even if one\u2019s usage\nof the watch drains the power quite\nquickly, the benefit of a small battery\nis that it can charge up very quickly \u2013\ndepleted to full in less than an hour.\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting\ntechnology in it, but the Moto 360\nis still mainly a watch. It\u2019s been\ndesigned with that mantra and it\u2019s\ngreat that there\u2019s a huge variety of\ncustomisation that can be done to the\nwatch face. The beauty of Android\nWear is that you can download\na simple app that lets you put on\nwhatever watch face you want. Be it\nanalogue or digital, there\u2019s always\nsome design that will suit you. Even\nwhen charging on the wireless dock, it\nacts as a minimalist bedside clock.\nOverall, the Moto 360 is a solid\npiece of technology. It takes voice\ncommands well, the screen is\ncolourful and the OS is mostly\nresponsive. It packs many features\nwhilst also managing to last more\nthan a day on a single charge.\nGranted, there are a few issues\nwith the watch, but I\u2019ve never felt\ndissatisfied wearing it.\nTo conclude, when judged on\nits own merit, the Moto 360 is a\nwonderful device that serves as a great\nextension to any Android owner.\nThe Moto 360 supports Android Wear meaning it's default interface is very customisable Photo: Paul Balaji\n\"[It] doesn't\njust look\nlike a\nwearable\npiece of\ntechnology;\nit's also a\nfashionable\ntimepiece\"\n\"It can\ncharge up\nvery\nquickly \u2013\ndepleted to\nfull in less\nthan an\nhour\"\nThe Moto 360 boasts the choice of three different strap colours and two\ndifferent body colours Photo: PC World\nPaul Balaji looks at the Moto 360 which the US irm hopes will turn heads this Christmas\n\n"

Photo: Print Room\nDarije Custovic reviews Dostoyevsky\u2019s irst existentialist novel\n\"... he wants\nto show us\nsomething\nreal: a dark\nand dirty\ncorner of\nthe human\nspirit.\"\n\" I am a\nsick man...\nI am an\nangry man.\nI am an unattractive\nman.\"\n\u201cIam a sick man... I am an angry\nman. I am an unattractive\nman.\u201d\nThis is the opening line of\nDostoyevsky\u2019s early work Notes From\nthe Underground. They are the words\nof the unnamed narrator, the fictive\nauthor of the titular notes written\nfrom \u201cunderground\u201d \u2013 his term for\nhis own self-imposed isolation. Every\nword that follows after this acts to\nreinforce these first statements; they\nreveal the nature of his sickness,\nbring out the bitterness in his rage,\nand expose his impotent, mean, and\nabove all, ugly spirit. This is not\neasy reading \u2013 but it is potent, for\nDostoyevsky\u2019s purpose is not simply\nto invent a horrible character, a\ncaricature. He wants more; he wants\nto show us something real: a dark and\ndirty corner of the human spirit that,\nfrankly, we may not want to look at.\nThe realism that Dostoyevsky creates\ncaptivates the reader; he understands\nwhat it is to inhabit this part of the\nhuman spirit, and he shows us the\nworldview, thought processes, and\nfeelings that come with its habitation.\nIt\u2019s tragic... it\u2019s repulsive. But, we are\nshown, it is there.\nThe book itself is set out in two\nparts. The first is essentially a long\nmonologue where the narrator,\nthe man from the underground,\nexpounds his outlook on life and\ntries to illuminate the causes of\nand reasoning behind it. And what\nan outlook! Straight away we are\nhit by the twisted mass of paradox\nand contradiction that he carries in\nhimself:;he is ill, he doesn\u2019t know\nwhat it is; he respects doctors, but he\nproclaims his respect for medicine\nto be superstitious; he won\u2019t visit a\ndoctor, to be spiteful: spiteful against\nwhom? Who knows? He doesn\u2019t.\nHe knows he will achieve nothing\nthrough inaction. This compulsively\ncontradictory nature, always pulling\nthe narrator\u2019s mind hard in two\ndirections, manifests itself again\nand again, and becomes a relentless\ntug-of-war on the reader\u2019s own\nmind and sympathies: on the one\nhand, the narrator\u2019s breathtaking\narrogance about his own intellectual\nand aesthetic capacities, and on\nthe other, declarations that \u201call\nintellectual activity is a disease\u201d;\nstrident statements about his firmest\nconvictions, which end in thin\njokes about how he doesn\u2019t believe a\nword he\u2019s said; his disturbing pride\nat explaining the \u201cfinessed\u201d and\nmasochistic pleasure he gets from\nbeing \u201ctoo clearly aware of [his] own\ndegradation\u201d.\nYet, for all the confusion this play\nof point and counterpoint creates, we\nalso see passages of startling lucidity,\nwhere the narrator lays down\nsystematic, reasoned arguments,\napologies for his strange beliefs\nand his behaviour \u2013 though, of\ncourse, the conclusions reached are\nquestionable, at best. But this clarity,\ntoo, Dostoyevsky folds into a paradox,\nas we see not only contradictory\nthoughts existing side-by-side, but\ncontradictory thought processes, the\nnarrator veering from his lucidity\ndown paths of thought where there\nare only outpourings of nonsense\nand emptiness. And then, to pull us\nfurther into contradiction, we find\nthat the narrator is supremely aware\nof his psychology, and of his own\ndeformity; he is not simply stupid.\nAll this drags us into the morass of\nthe man from the underground\u2019s\nthinking, and very effectively so;\nif I have a criticism of the book, it\nis that this aspect of the narrator\u2019s\ncharacter is, in a sense, too effectively\nportrayed \u2013 it gets tiring quickly, and\ninfuriates easily, though I suspect this\nis exactly how such a character would\nbe in reality. Something stopped\nme from putting the book down,\nhowever \u2013 despite the extremity of\nthe narrator\u2019s contradictions, and\ntheir ability to infuriate, the reader\ncannot help but see something\nreflected back at them; we see in these\ncontradictions our ability to assert\nour will, and our sometime desires\nto be different, to not do what we\u2019re\nsupposed to do, and to push against\nthe boundaries we feel around us.\nThis juxtaposition \u2013 of the narrator\u2019s\nextremes and our repugnance at\nthem, against our recognition that we\npossess some of those same elements\n\u2013 plays throughout the first part of\nthe book: not just in the narrator\u2019s\ncontradictions, but in his laziness, his\nanger, his neediness, and his doubts.\nThe second part of the book is\nmore straightforward, being a\ncollection of stories drawn from the\nnarrator\u2019s life, each illustrating how\nhis personality and worldview, laid\nout in such detail in the first part,\nplay out in a variety of situations \u2013 in\nbars and restaurants, placed opposite\nofficers, acquaintances, and whores.\nThe second part is an easier read,\nbeing both simpler to follow and\nlivelier in pace; it is entertaining\nand, at times, funny. But all of this\nis still underpinned by a distinctly\nsombre tone, which comes to the\nfore when our narrator encounters\nthe prostitute Liza. Here, in the\nscenes involving her, Dostoyevsky\ntakes us deep into the psyche of the\nunderground man \u2013 to the sad, limp,\nineffectuality at his core. Once we\nhave seen his essence, Dostoyevsky\nlets us go: in a poignant scene, during\nthe narrator\u2019s second and final\nencounter with Liza, she leaves, and\ntakes us, the reader, with her; we\ncan finally leave the man from the\nunderground \u2013 so contradictory,\ninfuriating and disturbing \u2013 behind.\nAnd him? He is left \u201cdecaying\nmorally in a corner\u201d in the same place\nwe found him.\nNotes from the Underground by\nFyodor Dostoyevsky is available from\nPenguin Classics for \u00a38.99.\n\n"

With the introduction of\niOS and Android, Windows is no\nlonger the only viable OS option out\nthere. iPads and Android tablets\nmight not be the productivity\npowerhouses that Windows is,\nbut they have certainly provided\nalternatives to people that would\notherwise have no other choice but\nto buy a Windows laptop. Bill Gates\u2019\nbrainchild is still by far the number\none operating system for personal\ncomputers but it hasn\u2019t been showing\nthe growth it used to \u2013 and PC\nmanufacturers aren\u2019t happy.\nThe main reason seems to be for all\nintents and purposes that Windows\nisn\u2019t \u201ccool\u201d . The operating system\nhas over time become associated with\nwork, essays and spreadsheets, while\niOS and Android devices have become\nassociated with social networking\nand creativity. But for the most part\npeople believe the device they carry\nis an extension of their personality\nand if that\u2019s true, then what does your\nWindows Phone say about you?\nMicrosoft needs to break the\npreconceptions people have about\nWindows. Their first attempt was\nWindows 8 \u2013 which focused on play\nas much as work. With a new design\nlanguage, Metro, and a touch friendly\ninterface, Bill Gates and co. were\nready to step into a new Windows era.\nI\u2019m not going to lie \u2013 I loved the\nmetro style interface. It was bold, it\nwas new, it looked good, and having\nall your information available to you\nat a glance was awesome. But that was\nnot the opinion of most people. They\nfelt Microsoft had left them behind\nto chase after some new market share.\nThis wasn\u2019t the Windows they were\nused to. This was some weird new\nFrankenstein OS with different touch\nand mouse parts stitched together\nand a very confusing split personality.\nAs a result most of them just opted\nnot to upgrade. Windows 7 still\nholds more than fifty per cent of the\nmarket while 8 is still struggling to\nbreak twenty per cent two years after\nits release.\nBut Windows 8 didn\u2019t just bring\na huge overhaul to the Windows\nsoftware, it brought massive changes\nto the devices that were running\nthem. Since its release, hybrid devices\nhave become the norm. One of those\ndevices is the Microsoft Surface \u2013 a\ndevice which represents everything\nthe company wanted to achieve\nwith Windows 8. A laptop and a\ntablet, work and play, one device to\nrule them all. But even after several\niterations of the device, sales still\nhaven\u2019t lived up to Microsoft\u2019s\n(perhaps optimistic) expectations.\nThe bad news doesn\u2019t stop there.\nWindows Phone has by all accounts\nnot achieved its goals, holding less\nthan three per cent of the smartphone\nmarket. Xbox sales haven\u2019t gone as\nwell as hoped \u2013 with the Xbox One\nbeing outsold by the Playstation 4\napproximately 3:1. Hammering a nail\ninto the Windows coffin, Apple has\nannounced growth in Mac sales in the\nlast two quarters \u2013 a section of the\nmarket otherwise falling year after\nyear. Whatever Microsoft attempts, it\ncan\u2019t seem to win.\nBut the company isn\u2019t giving up.\nWith their new CEO Satya Nadella\nat the helm and a new philosophy\ncentered on cloud services and\ndevices, Microsoft is ready to step up\nits game.\nLast month, the company showed\nthe public its new operating system,\nWindows 10. Skipping 9 is Microsoft\u2019s\nquirky way of saying that this version\nof Windows is truly the future.\nBut that might very well not be the\ntruth as 10 looks a whole lot like the\nWindows of the past.\nOne of the biggest changes to the\nnew OS is the return of the start\nmenu: a combination between 8\u2019s\nMetro start screen and 7\u2019s most used\napps list. Touch-friendly Metro apps\nthat could otherwise just be dragged\nto take up a certain percentage of\nthe screen, can now be manipulated\nwithin the familiar windows boxes we\nare all familiar with. There is also a\nfeature called Continuum which gives\nWindows 10 devices the capability to\nswitch between keyboard and touch\nmode, depending on the hardware it\ndetects.\nThese are all features designed to\nmake adopting the Windows design\nphilosophy as painless as possible, and\nby all accounts Microsoft seems to be\nsucceeding. It really does feel like 10\nshould have come before 8.\nBut not everything is a step back.\nThe company is introducing separate\ndesktops for the first time; a feature\nthat has been enjoyed by OS X and\nLinux users for quite a while now. But\nwhat is truly exciting about Windows\n10 is something no other company\nhas managed to do: a single app store\nfor all your windows devices. That\nincludes your phone, PC, tablet and\ngaming console. For the first time you\ncan have true integration across all of\nyour devices.\nBy creating Universal apps\nMicrosoft may be able to convince\nWindows PC users that buying a\nWindows Phone might not be such a\nbad idea, and buying an Xbox while\nyou\u2019re at it is an even better one.\nEx-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer (or what a man looks like seven years after saying \"There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant\nmarket share. No chance\") Photo: Wikimedia commons\nChrysostomos Meli inspects just what has gone wrong with Windows over the years\n\"This\nwas some\nweird new\nFrankenstein\nOS with\ndifferent\ntouch and\nmouse parts\"\n\"Skipping 9 is\nMicrosoft's\nquirky way\nof saying\nthat this\nversion of\nWindows\nis truly the\nfuture\"\n\n"

Oh\ndon\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you\u201d.\nA lot of people, including myself, are\nput off by these militant activists,\nencamped on their moral high\nground looking disdainfully down at\nthe rest of us.\nIn this article, I have instead tried\nto take a more moderate standpoint,\nstressing the practical benefits of\nvegetarianism as opposed to the\nhighly charged moral arguments.\nAlthough such arguments did play\nan important role in my decision\nto become vegetarian, I am more\ninterested here in demystifying\nvegetarianism for you, simply putting\nmy reasoning out there in order to\nfuel greater discussion and so that\nyou can reflect on your own culinary\ndecisions.\nI haven\u2019t always been vegetarian,\nmind you. In fact, it was only when I\ncame to Imperial and started having\nto cook for myself that I made the\nswitch. It had been on my mind for a\nwhile but this greater control of my\ndiet was the trigger to change. And\nit was not a decision I made lightly;\nI still love meat! However, when I\ngot used to being vegetarian, these\ncravings for meat slowly disappeared\nand now barely register.\nSo, here are the reasons why I am\nvegetarian:\nIt\u2019s super healthy and you\ncan still get plenty of protein\nSo long as you are getting all of\nyour vital vitamins and are eating\na balanced diet, being vegetarian is\nobjectively better for you, reducing\nyour risk of cardiovascular disease\nand some cancers.\n\u2018But vegetarian food is so\nunappetising!\u2019 If you feel a meal must\nbe based around a piece of meat, you\u2019d\nunderstandably be disappointed\nby vegetarian offerings; a rather\ninsipid Portobello mushroom is\nnever going to match up to a lovely\nfillet steak! But this needn\u2019t be the\ncase and if you look at cuisines where\nvegetarianism is better established,\nsuch as with Indian food, you will find\na sensational diversity of flavours and\ntextures, ensuring that you will never\nget bored.\n\u2018What about your protein?\u2019 This is\na common misnomer, with some of\nthe most energy dense foods being\nvegetarian, such as soy and eggs.\nAlso, some of the protein-rich meat\nsubstitutes, such as Quorn, I find to\ntaste a lot better than the real thing,\nespecially the mince.\nSo vegetarian food is not all\ndoom and gloom, there is actually a\nuniverse of food out there ready and\nwaiting to be explored.\nIt is easier to prepare and\ncook\nWhereas with meat, you are\nconstantly worrying whether you\nhave properly cleaned your chopping\nboard or thoroughly cooked the\nmeat, it doesn\u2019t really matter with\nvegetables. It\u2019s perfect if you\u2019re quite\na lazy cook and just want something\nto fill you up as it doesn\u2019t matter if\nyou over or undercook it, just throw it\nin a wok for a couple of minutes and\nyou\u2019ve got a delicious meal.\nIt\u2019s cheap, perfect for\nstudents\nUnless you\u2019re buying some Lidl\nassorted meats, going vegetarian is\na lot cheaper. This is very noticeable\nover the course of the year and as\nlong as you\u2019re buying in season and\nnot going for organic, you will have\nplenty of money left over for going\nout to fancy restaurants, it\u2019s great!\nBy not allowing yourself to\neat meat, you develop real\nmental strength\nThis is a great way to test your\nresolve and develop a skill that is\ntransferrable to all aspects of your\nlife: mind over matter. If every time\nyou are about to buy meat, you stop\nyourself, you will soon no longer need\nmeat to be able to function. Just like\nany addiction, it requires strength of\ncharacter to overcome.\nNow onto some of the more\nserious reasons, which, for me, form\nthe real backbone of my switch to\nvegetarianism.\nOn the grounds of\nsustainability\nHere, I look at the impact\nmeat consumption has on the\nenvironment. First of all, massive\ndeforestation is taking place across\nthe world to create space for cattle\nfarms, decimating these incredibly\nbiodiverse environments as a\nresult. This is having an important\nand lasting effect on the world\u2019s\necosystems and by removing demand\nfor these ranches, you could directly\nlead to more forests being saved.\nNext, in terms of energy\nconservation between trophic levels\n(remember all that stuff from GCSE\nbiology?), it is always going to be more\nefficient to eat organisms that use\nsolar energy to grow as opposed to the\nchemical energy of other organisms.\nIf you scale that up, you have a much\nmore cost-effective way of feeding\nthe world. I know that there is a lot\nof land unsuitable for arable farming\nwhere livestock are the only way to\ncreate sustenance, but we would not\nneed to exploit this land if we made\nbetter use of areas that could be\nfarmed.\n\u201cBut what effect could I have as an\nindividual?\u201d It is about the principle\nof acting ethically and dedicating\nyourself to an important cause. If we\ntook this mentality, we would never\nbe able to achieve anything!\nThe morality of animal\nhusbandry\nThis is a hotly contested topic, with\nboth the vegetarians and carnivores\nbeing deeply passionate about it.\nFor me, it does form the basis of my\nchoice to become vegetarian but I\ndo hope I have offered up enough\nreasons to make the switch so that,\neven if you don\u2019t agree with me here,\nyou would still consider it.\nI personally feel it is immoral to\nrear animals for the sole purpose of\nkilling them, where they have no\ncontrol over their own destiny. Just\nas you wouldn\u2019t want someone else\u2019s\nwill imposed on you, I don\u2019t think it is\nright for us to do the same to animals.\nDoes it not seem twisted that the only\nreason for their existence is to feed us,\neven though we are quite capable of\nsurviving without them?\n\u201cBut we are made to eat meat,\nwhat do we have canine teeth for\notherwise?\u201d The evolutionary\nargument that, because we are the\ndominant species, we have the right\nto do this, may be true but is not right\nand should not have any bearing on\nhow we behave. It\u2019s a naturalistic\nfallacy. Moreover, evolution is\nadaptive, not prescriptive and so you\ncan\u2019t say we ought to act a certain way\nbecause of evolution. Who knows,\nmaybe in thousands of years, canine\nteeth will be a thing of the past,\nreplaced by another set of molars to\nhelp grind down our delicious diet of\ngreens; oh how a man can dream!\n\n"

    "content": "46 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n21.11.2014\nSport Editor: Kunal Wagle\nDouble Tro\nAs Rosberg and Hamilton\ngo head to head one last\ntime, Felix asks whether\nthe awarding of double\npoints in the \ufb01nal race is\na good thing.\nThe world\u2019s premier motorsport\ncompetition descends on the\nYas Marina Circuit in Abu\nDhabi for the final race of the season\nin a cloud of anxiety, uncertainty, and\nthe usual hefty dose of controversy.\nThe awarding of double points at\nthe season ending Grand Prix was\nannounced, among a raft of other\nchanges, back in early December\n2013. The potential for controversy\nwas always obvious, but it is only now\nthat we are finding out what the real\nimplications are.\nFollowing Sebastian Vettel\u2019s\ndominant 2013 season, there was\na profound sense that something\nneeded to change. Romping home\nto the title with three races to spare,\nthe German ended the Formula One\nseason in every sense but on paper.\nF1, like any sport, must carefully\ntread the line between honest\ncompetition and entertainment.\nNo one wants to see artificial\ncompetition for its own sake but,\nas the financial struggles of minor\nteams come to the fore, it has never\nbeen clearer that F1 needs to do more\nto engage with its fans. Three dead\nrubber races at the end of the season\ndo no one any good.\nImagine if the final day of the\nRyder Cup was purely ceremonial,\nor Jessica Ennis was so far in front\nthat she needn\u2019t turn up for the final\nevents of the Olympic heptathlon.\nYes, the purity and the authenticity\nof the sporting contest must be\nmaintained, but sport has drama\nat its very heart. As double points\nmaintains the possibility that the\nresult could change, it preserves the\ndrama for as long as possible.\nWithout double points, Hamilton\nwould only have needed podiums\nafter his win at the Austin Grand\nPrix. Given the quality of the car\nhe is driving, that would be all but\nguaranteed. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nI want Lewis Hamilton to win the\ntitle, and there is no doubt in my\nmind that he has been the best\ndriver all year. The very essence of\nsport, however, is that, on \u2018any given\nSunday\u2019, it is all up for grabs. Make\nno mistake, if Lewis loses the title\nthis weekend, it will not be because of\ndouble points. If Nico Rosberg wins\non Sunday, Lewis will still outclass\nhim 10-5 in race wins. If he is not\ncrowned World Champion it will\nbe down to his poor results early in\nthe season. Whether those failures\nwere the fault of the team, the result\nof Lewis abusing his car, due to foul\nplay by Nico, or downright bad\nluck, we will never know. But in the\ncontext of double points it is totally\nirrelevant. Lewis has been the better\ndriver all year, but under both points\nsystems he could still lose this year\u2019s\ntitle. Rules change more frequently\nin F1 than any other sport. Success\nhas always gone to the team that\nbest adapts. As changes go, this is\nrelatively minor.\nWhen rugby union introduced\nend of season play offs to decide the\ntitle in 2003 Gloucester finished the\nregular season a mammoth 15 points\nclear, only to lose the final to London\nWasps. They were not pleased.\nA decade on and the drama of a\nPremiership Final has introduced\nnew fans to the sport while the season\nbuilds healthily to a resounding\nclimax. The contrast to an F1 season\ncould not be more pronounced.\nThe championship begins with the\nintrigue of winter testing, a first\nglimpse of the cars and the initial\nwhispers of who might have top\npace. The first few races come thick\nand fast and we quickly establish the\nfront runners. All too often and all\ntoo quickly the season trails off. One\nor two teams become established at\nthe front and the competition is as\ngood as over. Mid table outfits turn\ntheir attention to next year\u2019s car and\nleave the driver to battle on valiantly\nfor minor points. As a spectacle it\nstill has appeal; the glitz and glamour\nJACK ELKINGTON\nSPORTS WRITER\nYES\nof Monaco, the raw tribalism of the\nTifosi at Monza, the stunning street\ncircuit under lights at Singapore.\nPermutation Double Points Single Points\nWhat Hamilton needs to do to win,\nregardless of Rosberg\n2nd 7th\nWhat Rosberg needs to do, if\nHamilton fails to win points\n5th 2nd\nWhere Hamilton needs to finish\nto allow Rosberg to become World\nChampion without winning the race\n6th 11th\nThese iconic events will always hold\na place in the sporting calendar, but\nthe championship as a whole has lost\nits edge. Whether it was Schumacher\ndriving his Ferrari into the distance\na decade ago or Vettel\u2019s dominance\nof recent years, champions soon\nbecame unpopular because races\nbecame boring. Even Jenson Button\u2019s\n2009 World Championship is tainted\nby the fact that it was essentially\nwon before the summer break. A\nchampionship that goes to the wire,\nsuch as Hamilton\u2019s 2008 win and\nthis year\u2019s contest, is better for the\nsport and everyone involved in it.\nSince 1991, the result of just three\nchampionships would have changed,\nan additional three championships\nwould have gone to the wire and on\nthose occasions, more drivers would\nhave been involved in the shootout.\nF1 will always have a die-hard\nfollowing of motorsport fans and\nthe backing of the world\u2019s rich and\npowerful. In that way its survival is\nnot under threat. But if it is to truly\nthrive and take the place it deserves at\nthe top table of world sports, then it\nmust not be afraid to change its ways.\nDouble points may not be perfect\n\u2013 it may need tweaking. Perhaps it\ncould be extended to the last 3 races\nto reduce the random element of it,\nor a gradual increase over the course\nof the season to keep all the teams\nengaged. There are options. The big\nplayers in F1 got all the other changes\nspot on this season, and they are on to\nsomething here too.\nI hope they have the courage to\nstick with it.\nSome of the permutations for this weekend's final race at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, along with what\nthe equivalent permutations would have been if single points were in use for the race.\nPhoto: XPB.CC\n\n"

We\u2019ll even\nlet those people graduate without\neven attempting to discipline them\u201d\nsaid a College Spokesperson, \u201cBut\nwhen people are rude to one of our\nscientists because they didn\u2019t like his\nshirt it is completely terrible.\u201d\nThe situation has ultimately\nbeen completely baffling. Several\nprominent science men who get paid\nfor their opinions have even said\nthey don\u2019t understand why people are\ntreating this man like a woman.\nSome prominent science women\nhave tried to shed light on why the\nman is being treated like a woman,\nbut since the prominent science\nwomen probably only got their jobs\nto make up for diversity quotas back\nwhen they were attractive, their\nopinions are probably the bitter\nwailings of ugly old hags, and have\nthus been ignored.\naltruism that makes you feel semi-uncomfortable.\nIn six months\u2019 time you\u2019ll receive\nan automated email encouraging\nyou to congratulate I\u0148igo on his\nnew job in something to do with\nTHE HANGMAN GUIDE TO...\nAsking questions in lectures\nfinancial services in Hong Kong.\nHowever you\u2019ll be back to living\nat your dad\u2019s house and doing shelf\nstacking shifts at Morrison\u2019s, so you\nwon\u2019t be in the mood.\nInsufferable employed bastards\n\n"

Every November\nto January Somerset House is\ntransformed with marquees, magenta\nlighting and a giant Christmas\ntree ornate with vibrant baubles,\nbeckoning you in with alluring\nChristmasy vibe and charm.\nEach ice skating session lasts an\nhour, and it\u2019s best to arrive an hour\nearly so you can deposit your bag\nat the cloakroom to the right of the\nSomerset House main entrance. It\ncosts \u00a31 for two items so make sure\nyou grab your friend going in. No\ndangling items are allowed so make\nsure your phone or camera would fit\ninto your coat pocket!\nAs a student, you get 50% off\nticket price (which is \u00a314.55) with a\n\u00a32 booking fee; however this only\napplies to the daylight sessions. It\u2019s\nworth the extra money to go when\nit\u2019s dark to make the most out of the\nfestiveness. Having booked a 17:30\ntime slot, I was pleasantly surprised\nthat it wasn\u2019t overly crowded, which\nwas a big plus!\nThe ice ring is smaller than\nexpected \u2013 but offer an excellent view\nof the Christmas tree and Somerset\nHouse. As everyone makes the initial\ngrip-the-fence round, classical music\nplayed softly mingling with the\ndelicious scent of mulled wine from\nthe adjacent restaurant. The lighting\nchanges periodically from magenta to\nsnowflake to my favourite crisscross\nice-fracture effect. Personally I find\nthe music choice peculiar, a mix of\nclassical with an odd pop song thrown\nin. The surface was rather wet and\nslippery as well, not ideal for novice\nskaters.\nWhilst it isn\u2019t the best place to\nskate, the great atmosphere and\nsetting was definitely worth a visit. It\nis after all free to wonder in and take\nsome photos, even if you don\u2019t want\nto go to the ice ring.\nThe story behind Local Spotlight and the London focus\nPeople always associate travelling\nwith an initial journey that\ninvolves flying,long hours and pre-planning,at the very least an hour\nor so on a coach or train.\nHowever,this isn\u2019t the case.\nTravelling can happen anywhere\nand all it takes is for you to take a\nstep outside your house.It can be to\nthe other side of the city,or to that\ncorner of the street that you never\nbeen to,it can even be your own\nbackyard if you think people would\nbe interested in what\u2019s there!\nLondon is constantly voted\nnumber one destination on\nTripadvisor and there are countless\nthings to do in the capital.From\nroller skating disco to exclusive\nMuseum exhibitions,London is a\ncity that never gets boring,unless\nyou lock yourself at home and never\nventures out.\nDo you know any interesting pop\nup events that are happening?\nE-mail you articles to travel.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk!\nYUNG NAM CHEAH\n\n"

Add in the chaotic\nclimax of the second round, and it\u2019s\na surprise she\u2019s still going at all: the\ncollapse of the arena, the revelation\nthat the rebellion is underway and\nspear-headed by the previously lost\nDistrict 13, and the crushing reveal\nthat District 12 \u2013 home \u2013 is no more.\nSmall wonder she spends the opening\nmoments of this, the third film in\nthe series (and the first part of the\nfinal book \u2013 split, predictably, into\ntwo parts), curled up in a corner,\nreciting her name, her home, her\nparticipation in the Hunger Games\nand her relationship with Peeta over\nand over again.\nThe following two hours chart\nKatniss\u2019 attempt to claw back her\nsanity, to fight through the extensive\npost-traumatic stress disorder and to\nkeep doing what she has always tried\nto do \u2013 survive. Survive, and protect\nher family. True to the sense of\nescalation that was so plain in the first\ntwo films, the stakes for survival are\nhigher than ever \u2013 the rebellion has\nbegun, districts are in open conflict\nwith the Capitol, and war has arrived.\nNo-one is safe. As the Mockingjay,\nKatniss is the face of the rebellion, a\nfigurehead for the districts to rally\nbehind \u2013 but as becomes plain, she is\nreally just a pawn in someone else\u2019s\ngame.\nJust as her image was manipulated\nin The Hunger Games and in\nCatching Fire, so too is it twisted here,\nto suit the ends of President Coin,\nthe leader of District 13. The idea\nof figureheads, of public perception\nand the way propaganda allows the\nstate to toy with it, is one of the\ncore concepts running through the\nfirst Mockingjay instalment \u2013 one\nof many \u2013 and it\u2019s one returning\ndirector Francis Lawrence takes great\ndelight in playing with.\nThis is very much a film of\nconcepts, of high ideas and worrying\nquestions about society and its\ndarker nature. It\u2019s a trait that stems\nfrom the original books, which were\nalways wonderfully subversive, and\nnowhere was it more evident than the\nfinal book. The decision to split the\nfilms was a predictable one, but what\nappears to be a cynical cash grab has\nactually worked in the series\u2019 favour.\nThe doubled run-time gives this first\nfilm room to breathe, to introduce\nthe key new players and flesh out old\nfaces, allowing for maximum impact\ncome the second part\u2019s far-more\naction heavy bent.\nIf that makes it sound like\nMockingjay wanders towards the\nInterstellar route of extensive\ndialogue that examines the key\nthemes intensely, then it\u2019s a\nmisleading sentiment. Mockingjay\nmanages to weave its themes\ndelicately into the backdrop of civil\nwar, finding time for both riotous\naction scenes and tongue-in-cheek\nmockery of its own marketing\ncampaign. Admittedly, the lack of\nan actual Hunger Games leaves it\nwith considerably less in the action\nstakes than before, but the series has\n\u2013 at heart \u2013 never really been about\nthe violence. It\u2019s always been about\nsomething more, andMockingjay\nmarks the point at which it can\nfinally embrace it.\nIt\u2019s an opportunity seized with\nboth hands by all involved, from\nthe directing Lawrence to the acting\nLawrence, along with the entirety\nof the supporting cast. Jennifer\nLawrence continues to prove her\ntalent, out-doing herself here as the\nmentally fragile Katniss, forced into\nbecoming a symbol of a resistance\nshe never wanted to start, while\nDonald Sutherland as the malevolent\nPresident Snow remains a highlight.\nThe late, great Phillip Seymour\nHoffman comes to life in this, his\nlast film, taking his weirdly subdued\nPlutarch Heavensbee to far greater\nheights, and new cast member Natalie\nDormer continues to prove herself\nthe queen of supporting actresses.\nJosh Hutcherson is finally given\nsomething more complex to toy with,\nas Peeta is forced to turn traitor on\nTV, becoming the Capitol\u2019s equivalent\nof Katniss, a mouthpiece for those\nmore powerful than himself, and\nit\u2019s to his great credit that he pulls it\noff. Jeffrey Wright, too, deserves a\nmention \u2013 his Beetee is turned into a\nHunger Games equivalent of Bond\u2019s\nQ, with a gadget-lab sequence to\nmatch.\nCombined with the goosebump-inducing score by James Newton\nHoward, which re-uses and\nmanipulates its familiar motifs into\nsomething even more unsettling, the\ncast are universally excellent, selling\nevery moment of the film \u2013 not least\nthe sheer devastation of the ruined\nDistrict 12, the images of which push\nthe limits of the film\u2019s 12A rating.\nAlways a series that teetered on\nthe upper limits of the rating \u2013 the\noriginal was deemed a 15 until cuts\nwere made \u2013 Mockingjay continues to\nfind new ways to stretch the so-called\n\u2018acceptable\u2019, and it\u2019s all the better\nfor it. This is not a film that pulls\nany punches, and nor should it. The\nsame streak of dry humour evident\nin all three films is alive here, but so\nis something more \u2013 a darkness, an\nanger, bubbling up and boiling over.\nThe Hunger Games series is heading\nto its conclusion. The greatest fight\nis yet to come, and as Part 1 of\nMockingjay comes to a dramatic,\nheart-breaking close, it can\u2019t come\nsoon enough.\nOnce more unto the breach\nJack Steadman joins the rebellion\nPhoto: Francis Lawrence/Lionsgate\n\"Mockingjay\ncontinues\nto find new\nways to\nstretch the\nso-called\nacceptable.\"\n\"Being\nthrown\ninto the\narena for\nthe Hunger\nGames twice\nin quick\nsuccession\nwould be\nenough\nto break\nanyone.\"\n\n"
