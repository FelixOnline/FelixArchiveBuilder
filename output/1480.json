They tend\nto focus on what\u2019s going on in the background and\nare less likely to notice moving objects closer to\nthem. The brain region responsible for suppressing\nirrelevant visual information, the middle temporal visual area, loses function over time. So the next time\nyou get run over by lovely Betty here, just remember:\nit\u2019s not her fault.\nI received this book as a Christmas present, probably\nas a humorous allusion to my ineptitude at physics.\nThe premise is very simple: Emmy the dog is adopted by Orzel, a physics Professor, and subsequently\nbecomes enraptured with his work and how it applies\nto everyday dog issues. Orzel is happy to explain,\ncreating a witty dialogue between the two.\nUsing Emmy\u2019s tendency to chase squirrels and\nher attempts to tunnel into the neighbour\u2019s garden,\nOrzel takes the reader through the fundamentals of\nquantum mechanics, from Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty\nprinciple to quantum tunnelling, quarks and gluons.\nI expected a simplistic overview of the subject but\nthe book is surprisingly comprehensive, using the relationship between dog and owner to breathe some\nlife into what can sometimes be a dry subject. Orzel\nwrites succinctly and with a genuine passion for the\nphysics which is reflected in Emmy\u2019s enthusiasm,\nproviding a highly readable and novel way of approaching quantum physics.\nKatya-yani Vyas\nContagious canine cancer\nChloe McIvor\nResearchers working on a contagious cancer\nfound in dogs have discovered that the cancerous cells adopt an unusual method of genetic\nrepair.\nThe results of this study, published in Science\nlast week, suggest that this particular cancer\ncombats genetic decay by \u201cstealing\u201d genes\nfrom its canine host.\nCanine Transmissible Venereal Tumour\n(CTVT) is considered an unusual disease as\nwe predominantly think of cancer as strictly\nnon-infectious. Thankfully, transmissible cancers are not found in humans and diseases such\nas CTVT differ from other cancers in several\nways.\nMost cancers occur as a result of genetic\nchanges that make a normal cell develop into\na cancerous one. With transmissible forms, the\ncancerous cell comes from another dog and\nshares its genome with the first animal in which\nthe disease developed.\nDr Clare Rebbeck, a former PhD student at\nImperial College, was originally investigating\nthe genetic variation between CTVT samples\nand their geographic location. She noticed that\nthe genetic differences found in the DNA of the\nmitochondria \u2013 commonly referred to as the\n\u201cpower-houses\u201d of the cell \u2013 were much greater\nthan those found in the nuclear DNA.\nUntil now, scientists believed that mitochondria were only transferred via inheritance\nFriday 28 JANUARY 2011\nthrough the maternal line. This research is the\nfirst evidence of mitochondrial transfer between genetically distinct cells outside of the\nlaboratory.\nIt is thought that CTVT has developed this\nstrategy of recruiting host mitochondria to\ncombat the degradation that tends to occur in\ncancer\u2019s own mitochondria.\nLeader of the study, Professor Austin Burt of\nthe Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, is\nhopeful that the finding will help improve our\nunderstanding of the development of cancer in\ngeneral.\n\u201cOur study has revealed that this type of cancer works in a really unexpected way.\u201d he says,\n\u201cit raises some really important questions about\nthe progression of other cancers, such as how\nthey repair their own DNA.\u201d\nThe origin of CTVT is thought to be linked to\nthe domestication of the dog, as it can be traced\nback to approximately 10,000 years ago.\nSince then the disease has been transmitted\nsexually among dog populations and at some\npoint it developed this ability to take up host\nmitochondria to replace the cancer\u2019s own damaged ones.\nNot only does this research mark a significant\ndevelopment in our understanding of mito-chondria, it also likely to prove useful to future\ncancer research.\nMelissa Lever\nThe social amoeba, Dictyostellum discoideum, harvests bacteria when times are hard\nSlime moulds its own little landscape\nThe humble amoeba is more intelligent than\nyou would think. A new study published in\nNature by evolutionary biologists at Rice University has found that the social amoeba Dictyostellum discoideum exhibit a primitive form\nof agriculture.\nA genetic trait in one third of the \u201cDicty\u201d\namoeba species \u2013 also affectionately known\nas \u201cslime mould\u201d \u2013 causes them to engage in\ndispersal and prudent harvesting of the crop.\nWhile this form of farming may not be as\nadvanced as that of fungus growing ants and\nbeetles who cultivate their crops, for example,\nthe discovery is surprising given that amoeba\nare mere single-celled organisms.\nThe Dictyostellum species are labelled as\nsocial since, when prey becomes scarce, tens\nof thousands of amoeba will aggregate into a\nmigratory slug. If being an amoeba wasn\u2019t already unappealing, taking part in this aggregation process is potentially sacrificial, since 20%\nof the cells forming the slug will die to form\na sterile stalk. The stalk aids the dispersal of\nthe surviving cells which form spores within a\nspherical structure called the sorus.\nIt was previously thought amoeba would\ngorge themselves on their prey, bacteria, before forming their fruiting bodies, but the study\nshows that approximately a third will stop\nfeeding early and incorporate the bacteria into\nthe fruiting bodies.\nThe lead author Debora Brock explains: \u201cWe\nthink they\u2019re able to do this because they\u2019re\nsocial\u201d.\nSolitary amoeba, by comparison, do not form\nthe fruiting bodies that enable the amoeba to\ntravel.\nThe ability to farm is not always beneficial.\nThe study shows that rewards of farming are\ncontext dependent. As expected, the farming\namoeba had a clear upper-hand against non-farming amoeba when transferred to bacteria-free plates. This advantage disappeared when\nfarming spores were transferred to a site abundant in edible bacteria.\nThe non-farming amoeba were in fact able\nto produce more spores in this environment\ncompared to the farmers. The explanation was\nattributed to the habits of the farmers, who consume less bacteria in order to preserve some for\ndispersal.\nA further disadvantage to the farmers is that\nthey are forced to make smaller fruiting bodies,\nand cannot travel as far.\n\u201cTo think of a single-celled amoeba performing something that you could consider farming,\nI think, is surprising,\u201d Ms Brock sai,. \u201cchoices\nlike that are generally costly, so there has to be\na pretty large benefit for it to persist in nature.\u201d\nYou should see this guy on the half pipe.... Surprisingly, he\u2019s not that good\n\n"

Smoke and Mirrors is a collection of short stories and poems that possess a subtle elegance that is often lacking in longer books.\nNeil Gaiman\u2019s stories are often dark and disturbing\nwith a hint of the occult. It\u2019s hard to imagine that\nthe same author writes children\u2019s fantasy or has\nco-written with Terry Pratchett.\nThe stories in Smoke and Mirrors are reprints\nfrom anthologies, so are incredibly varied. Most\nare a mix of fantasy, horror and the occult, drawn\ntogether in Gaiman\u2019s entrancing style of writing, but\nsome, like The Goldfish Pool, are more real and viv-id. Whether it\u2019s a disturbing version of Snow White\nor We Can get them for You Wholesale, a sinister\nstory about assassins who offer discounts for large\norders, the book is bound to have something in it\nfor everyone. My personal favourite is The White\nRoad, a chilling poem about Mr Fox and the murders he committed.\nIn Smoke and Mirrors, Gaiman gives a glimpse of\nanother world that is not so different from our own,\nwhere the surreal is treated as ordinary. It can be\nread in those few moments a student has to spare.\nWhether you\u2019ll want to read them again is for you to\ndiscover, but I urge you to give them a try at least\nonce. You may find that you like horror after all.\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nZainab Ali puts the case for this\ncollection of poems and short\nstories by a darkly original author\nSmoke\nand Mirrors by Neil Gaiman\nWhich book do you love more than any other? Tell\nus why it\u2019s so good - Send 300 to 400 words to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWill Prince\nEverybody, it seems, loves Terrence Rattigan\nat the moment \u2013 or Terry, as the people who\nsat next to me during the Jermyn Street Theatre\u2019s production of Less Than Kind, insisted\non calling him. Last summer, After The Dance\nat the National Theatre paved the way for Terry\u2019s centenary year in 2011 and the Old Vic is\nbringing their rendition of Cause C\u00e9l\u00e8bre to\nthe stage in March \u2013 be sure to watch this page\nfor details. And whilst the latter two sought to\nadd clout by drafting in big names, the Jermyn\nStreet Theatre (JST) has taken a different approach entirely. Rather than trawl ES Magazine\nfor glossy faces, it seems they\u2019ve been venturing into the archives.\nThis is Less Than Kind\u2019s maiden perfor-mance. Despite being written during the war\nyears, Rattigan\u2019s own lack of self-belief and\nthe capricious world of show business meant it\nwas worked and reworked and then finally left\nfor dead \u2013 only one copy remained, saved in a\nlicense office. And JST must be commended for\ntheir efforts. Whilst they might not have uncovered a gem, they\u2019ve certainly found a keeper.\nThe story centres on Olivia, an attractive yet\nsimple-minded widow, as she tries to reconcile\nher forthright, left-wing son and her wealthy\nparamour, a cabinet minister briefed in tank\nproduction. The scene opens on an apparently\nblissful familial scene, but gradually we see the\nseams in the patchwork quilt of life appearing.\nSir John Fletcher, the lover, and Michael, the\nson, tug the fabric to breaking point, until the\nwoman is forced to decide between son and\nlover.\nA struggle ensues between the men, with\nploys aplenty, in a scenario that at times has\nechoes of Hamlet. Despite this, the setting is\ndistinctly British and inescapably 1940\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s\nall hard times, dried egg omelettes, evenings at\nJaw-dropping prices, gallery owners hovering like buzzards around the fat-of-wallet and\npretentious conversations carrying through the\nair: \u201cThis is Christophe\u2019s latest work, he\u2019s currently juxtaposing renaissance frescos with imagery from Countdown.\u201d A landscape entitled\n\u201cProfane Impossibility of Diametric Neurosis\u201d\n(it\u2019s not pretentious because it\u2019s, like, obviously\nironically pretentious, you know?) and a gallery called Pratt Contemporary... It can all mean\nonly one thing \u2013 the London Art Fair (LAF) has\nrolled into town for another year, bringing with\nit all that is both bad and good in UK art.\nThe bad? See above. It\u2019s hard not to feel a\ntinge of cynicism when viewing the commercial art-world in all its pustulent glory. Maybe\nit\u2019s the idealist \u2013 and former art student, fact-fans \u2013 in me, but somehow the sight of an object dragged kicking and screaming from the\ndeepest depths of an individual\u2019s tortured soul,\nor painted surfaces of delicate and shimmering beauty, or scribbled sketches that somehow\ncapture the very \u2018now-ness\u2019 of the moment in\nall its simplicity and complexity \u2013 all these sit\nslightly uneasily with the sight of some bloke\nwith a dodgy cravat trying to flog it to you for\nfifty grand. Ah well, everyone needs to make a\nliving I suppose.\nAnd the good? Well \u2013 the art itself, happily\nenough. Not all of it, obviously \u2013 some of it\nwas rubbish, RUBBISH I tell you \u2013 but a lot of\nit was very good indeed. The LAF is a basically\na trade fair \u2013 much like you get in any other\nindustry, such as plumbing for example \u2013 only\ninstead of ball-valves, stop-cocks and brass\nnipples, all the stalls sell... paintings. I heartily recommend a visit to next year\u2019s event \u2013 although a minor Lottery win may be required if\nyou want to leave with anything more substantial than the Fair Guide.\nI should also add that it\u2019s bloody massive, so\nmy five highlights are just there to the right.\n(For a fun interactive reading experience, why\nnot try Googling them to have a look?)\nSara Crowe and her internal struggle\nthe pictures and knowing your place.\nThis may all seem very plain vanilla, but Rattigan injects into his pieces a distilled essence\nof normality \u2013 turns of phrase, idioms and id-iosyncracies \u2013 that makes all the proceedings\nvery real. The notions of stiff upper lip and\nfemale sacrifice are delicately touched upon.\n\u201cI love how you turn everything into a joke,\nI wish I could do that,\u201d says the bouncy and\nblunt Michael to his mother with a smile, as\none sees ever more clearly the painful necessity\nof her own smile in the face of grim situations.\nAdrian Brown\u2019s production is a very solid\npiece of theatre, well staged and neatly cast.\nWhilst at first the piece lacked vigor, any first\nact qualms were well allayed by the final cur-tain. Sara Crowe pitches the character of Olivia well, and makes the comic lines her own.\nMichael Simkins brings his role as Sir John\nFletcher a gravitas and authority than contrasts\nperfectly with the boyish cockiness of David\nOsmond as Michael.\nLess Than Kind, in truth, has all the ingredients to be a run of the mill piece of theatre,\nbut strangely, I must confess, I really enjoyed\nit. Surveying the crowd, waiting for the lights\nto dim and seeing that your presence probably\nbrings the audience age down a decade never\nbodes well. But by the end, I found myself in\nits the fabric, being tugged to and fro by the\ncharacters\u2019 conflicts, and cheered throughout\nby Rattigan\u2019s polished one-liners and endearing characters. Good, traditional theatre.\nJermyn Street Theatre until 12th Feb.\nLess Than Kind, more than ordinary\nJack Jelfs\nLondon Art Fair Highlights\nA brand new old-fashioned play, full of 1940\u2019s atmosphere\nThe huge art sale is still a good show\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 11\nSCIENCE\nFriday 28 JANUARY 2011\nMaciej Matuszewski\nS ci-Fi\nColumn\nThose of you who complained about\nme focusing so much on the plot holes\nin my Moon review should stop reading\nnow because this is much of the same.\nI\u2019m sorry, but I just couldn\u2019t pass up the\nopportunity to review a show as monumentally stupid as Primeval.\nThe series focuses on a secret government team tasked with investigating mysterious \u2018anomalies\u2019, basically\nbig glowing disco balls which act as\ngateways to different time periods, and\nprotecting the public from the dangerous creatures which often come through\nthem. I could understand this secrecy at\nthe beginning of the show when the government had only just found out about\nthe situation and wanting to stop the\npublic from panicking but not after three\nand half seasons when they\u2019ve developed methods of both detecting and closing the anomalies. Indeed we have seen\nmany civilians brutally killed just because they were not aware of the danger\nposed by the creatures. This makes even\nless sense as in the latest series where,\nmirroring real life, the Tories have part\nprivatised the top secret operation, giving control of the its scientific arm to\nPhilip Burton, played by Star Trek\u2019s Alexander Siddig, and his company.\nThe team itself is hilariously incom-petent, in the latest series managing to\nget trapped in a creature infested school\nby a pair of teenagers. This is not helped\nby most of the missions being done by\njust the four of main cast members,\none of whom, Connor, is a palaeontology student. A recent episode involved\nhim accepting Doctor Bashir\u2019s, sorry, I\nmean Philip\u2019s, offer to study the anomalies themselves. I haven\u2019t seen all of the\nepisodes so perhaps somebody could\nexplain to me why, if Connor is so interested in advanced physics, he didn\u2019t\nchoose to study it.\nFans of the show might accuse me of\nnitpicking. This might be true but even if\nyou ignore all of these factors the show\nis still average at best, with a horribly\nconfused storyline and mediocre special\neffects.At least if you concentrate on the\nplot holes it becomes so bad it\u2019s good,\nrather than just being boring.\nSuperfast genome sequencing on a chip\nInternational effort to make air travel greener begins at Imperial\nLook at them, aren\u2019t they cute\nThe first step on a path that could lead\nto the sequencing of an entire genome\nin minutes has been developed by chemists at Imperial College London. A paper\ndescribing the prototype technology was\npublished last month in the journal Nano\nLetters.\nThis innovation also means sequencing will become much cheaper, making\nit available to everyone.\nIt was ten years from the start of the\nHuman Genome Project to the publication of the first draft of an entire human\ngenome.\nWhile things have moved on considerably since then, we\u2019re still not at\nthe stage where anyone can unlock the\nsecrets of their DNA for a reasonable\nprice. As it stands, the process can take\nweeks or months of continuous work to\nsequence all the DNA of an individual.\nCurrent methods require several steps,\nincluding the breakdown and replication\nof the DNA, which is done by robots.\nThe effort and time required means that\nthe cost is prohibitively high.\nThe new technology in development\nat Imperial would streamline sequencing into a single procedure.\nDNA is made up of around 3 billion\nbase pairs attached to a sugar and phosphate backbone, arranged in a double\nhelix. A base pair consists of two molecules bonded together \u2014 either adenine\nwith thymine, or guanine with cytosine.\nDNA sequencing determines the order\nof these base pairs.\nThe new technology pushes a strand of\nDNA through a 50 nanometre wide pore\nin a silicone chip at high speed. When\nit leaves the pore, an electrical current\npasses through the DNA. From the resulting signal a computer determines\nwhich base pair has just passed through\nthe nanopore. The speed at which it can\ndo this means that, in theory, an entire\ngenome could be sequenced within min-utes.\nGenome sequencing for all would\nhave many benefits. It could mean\ncustom drugs based on a person\u2019s own\nDNA and would give individuals access to information about their suscepti-bilities to diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\nFast genome sequencing would also\nbenefit police who want a quick yet reliable way to profile DNA found at crime\nscenes.\nThe technology will require more\nwork before it\u2019s ready to sequence its\nfirst genome but Dr Joshua Edel, a coauthor of the paper, is optimistic: \u201cIt\nshould be significantly faster and more\nreliable, and would be easy to scale up to\ncreate a device with the capacity to read\nup to 10 million bases per second, versus the typical 10 bases per second you\nget with the present day single molecule\nreal-time techniques.\u201d\nDr Tim Albrecht, another author on\nthe study, said that the next step was\nto create something that can determine\nbetween individual bases as opposed to\njust base pairs. He was cautious about\nthe work ahead, saying: \u201cI think we\nknow the way forward, but it is a challenging project and we have to make\nmany more incremental steps before our\nvision can be realised.\u201d\nThe Green Aviation Forum organised a\none day international symposium at Imperial College on the 6th January 2011,\nin an attempt to link together many of\nthe green aviation research activities ongoing at the College.\nThe Forum aimed to address the multiple environmental challenges faced\nby the aviation sector. An integrated\napproach is being adopted to develop\naircraft technologies focussing on fuel\nefficiency and low-emission across the\nwhole sector, improve airport planning \u2013\nwith supporting transport infrastructure\n\u2013 as well as air traffic management. The\nkey word is collaboration, integrating\nmanufacturers, climate scientists, regu-lators, airline operators, airport authorities and the government.\nThree percent of global warming is\ncurrently caused by aviation and air\ntravel is expected to increase by 5% per\nyear over the next 20 years. The aviation industry in Europe has agreed to\na set of targets that would reduce fuel\nand carbon dioxide emissions by 50%\nper passenger kilometre, nitrous oxide\nemissions by 80% and noise pollution\nby 50%.\nThe Green Aviation Forum will provide a useful link between Imperial researchers and the aviation industry. Imperial is aiming to give birth to a new\ngeneration of ultra light commercial\naircrafts that can fly faster over longer\ndistances, producing lower emissions\nand less noise.\nAs an aircraft comes in to land, spoilers are deployed on the wing to help reduce the lift and increase the drag. This,\nhowever, generates low frequency noise\nthat can travel great distances which is a\nmajor problem for the aviation industry.\nProfesor Vassilicos and his team from\nthe Department of Aeronautics have developed a new spoiler employing fractal\npatterns that reduce the low frequency\nnoise, without affecting the lift and drag.\nAn aircraft burns more fuel mainly\ndue to the aerodynamic force known\nas drag. Professor Jonathan Morrisson\nand colleagues from the Department\nof Chemical Engineering and Chemical Technology are developing a new\nelectro-active plastic for covering aircraft fuselages and wings, which reduces drag by pulsing low-level electrical\ncurrents through it. The pulses distort\nthe plastic and therefore the air flowing\nover the plane, reducing the impact of\ndrag.\nEco-friendly plane designs are currently being developed by Dr Varnavas\nSerghides from the Department of Aeronautics. He believes that reducing the\nnumber of aircraft components could\nbring dramatic increases in fuel effi-ciency. Dr Varnavas is also working on\ndesigning a wider fuselage to fit in more\npassengers. This would reduce the levels\nof emissions, while maintaining similar\nprofit levels.\nImperial researchers are also developing new types of composite material that\ncan render aircraft structures even stronger and more long-lived. One type of\nmaterial, known as a hierarchical com-posite, comprises carbon fibres, resin\nand carbon nanotubes.\nAs well as being stronger, this type of\nmaterial can withstand lightning strikes\nby dissipating the electrical energy before the aircraft system is damaged.\nWhen the skies became green\nKelly Oakes\nVictoria Bignet\nNew composite materials will make planes of the future lighter, stronger and longer lived \u2013 like Thunderbird 2 here\nDNA is not actually made of beads\n\n"

    "content": "17\nfelix FRIDAY 28 january 2011\nCOMMENT\nI\ntry not to listen to BBC Radio\nif I can help it, because I want\nold age to hold some surprises\nand given that I already eat mint\nimperials all day and complain\nabout \u2018the youth\u2019I\u2019m feeling that it\u2019s not\nholding much back.\nLast week a friend linked me to a\nradio segment that involved Michael\nGove, current education secretary and\nformer Elmer Fudd impersonator, going\ntoe-to-toe with a listener calling in to a\nRadio 5 discussion on education. Being\nthe classy sort of guy that he apparently\nis, Gove cut the man off, misinterpreted\nmost of his remarks, and stalled more\nthan a <car brand> in a <weather type>.\nThe conversation was about the usual\npetty stuff like the education of a nation\u2019s children, but Gove\u2019s lack of professionalism was remarkable. The man\u2019s\nrunning a section of our government.\nHis desk probably has tiny red buttons\non it that cause things to explode when\npressed.\nThe button he\u2019s been mashing lately\nis the one about education reform. The\nsoundbite Gove attempted to manufacture was that he wanted more \u2018facts\u2019 in\neducation; the flaw being that not only\ndoes this sound massively idiotic, but\nonce you get past the \u201cI guess that\u2019s better than teaching stuff we made up on the\ncommute in to work, Mr. Gove\u201d stage of\ncomprehension, you realise what he actually means: learning by rote.\nGove\u2019s noticed that children from\nother countries are outperforming British children and has decided that the answer to this is to emulate their education\nsystem entirely. Although apparently he\nmay be taking it slightly too far, as in\nDecember he wrote that \u201clike Chairman\nMao, we\u2019ve embarked on a Long March\nto reform our education system\u201d. I\u2019m assuming he won\u2019t be actually murdering\nteachers in the street like Mao did.\nI don\u2019t think anyone would disagree\nwith Gove\u2019s appraisal of the current sit-uation. Our children are, on the whole,\nnot performing as well as the best in\nother countries. There are a lot of factors affecting this, but before we go off\ninvestigating them and trying to emulate\nthe education policies of infamous communist revolutionaries it might be wise\nto ask whether we want to have their\neducation systems.\nIndia\u2019s engineering industry is taking\noff in a big way. Everything from software to civil via aeronautics - you name\nit, they\u2019ve got a university producing\nstudents as good as Imperial\u2019s or bet-ter. Two, three, four years ago this was\nbig news, and people were talking about\nthe rise of their university system like\nit was the future. That\u2019s calmed down a\nbit lately, however, as more and more of\ntheir graduates reach the workplace and\npeople notice an unusual trend - a lot of\nthem don\u2019t really want to be there.\nI\u2019m not an education theorist, but I\ndo know that the reason the teachers\u2019\nunions want relaxed curriculums is because it allows creativity on the part of\nteachers, and exploration on the part of\nstudents. Both of these things allow for\nchildren to find their place in the world\nand do a job they really want to.\nAnyway, hopefully that answers all\nthose dozens of emails I get asking for\nmy opinion on education reform in the\npost-Labour United Kingdom. Next\nweek on Angry University: could the\nIsrael-Palestine conflict have been resolved by stealing everyone\u2019s maps and\nrefusing to give them back?\nT\nhe audience were in complete silence for 64 min-utes. Everyone was hanging onto every single word\nthat Lilly Ebert, a Holocaust survivor, spoke. Her story is another one of the countless testimonies\nwe have all been listening to since the\nsurvivors vouched to share their stories\nagain and again so that we could prevent\nsomething so tragic, so monstrous, so\ninhumane from ever happening again.\nHave we learned our lesson though?\nWhat one might see in Mrs Ebert is a\nwoman who shall not be silenced \u2013 we\nadmire her bravery and courage to speak\nthrough her tears about the horrors of\nAuschwitz and concentration camps\nalike. She stands as living proof of what\nEurope and the rest of the world allowed\nhappen in the 1940s. One might argue\nthat there was nothing that could have\nbeen done, that Hitler could not have\nbeen stopped. I disagree, and wish to\nshare with you why.\nWar has been a constant theme in my\nlife. I was born in Sarajevo in 1989 and\nwhen the war started in 1992, I was fortunate enough to escape with my mother\nand two siblings to Split in Croatia and\nthen to New York. My father stayed and\nfought in the war and was wounded\nthree times. I remember going back a\nyear after the war ended and seeing bullet and grenade holes in every building\nin my home town, I remember the story\nof my first cousin being shot on the bat-tlefront, my best friend\u2019s recollection of\nher elder brother and aunt being hit by\na grenade, children being warned not\nto enter abandoned homes or to go into\nmine fields (this is still a major problem\nin Bosnia today). Now that I think of it,\nmy grandfather was sent off to a concentration camp in the Balkans \u2013 Jasenovac\n\u2013 during WWII. I never met him. You\nget the idea.\nNow, that paragraph was not written\nto ask for pity, but rather for your empathy and compassion for today\u2019s victims.\nI\u2019d like to evoke your understanding and\nrecognition of what had happened and\nwhat is happening now. I cannot even\nbegin to imagine the horrors that Lilly\nEbert went through, but I realize that we\nhave not quite learned our lesson.\nLilly Ebert left the packed lecture theatre with the following:\n\u201cIt was an upside-down world where\ngood was bad and bad was good \u2013 what\ndo I mean by this? Killing someone was\naccepted and helping someone was pun-ished. When you came out of this world\n[Auschwitz], you had no money, no\neducation, no anything, and you had to\nbegin a new life. Not a lot of books were\nwritten about that. Not that many people stayed normal. That is my story\u2026it\nmakes no difference what religion you\nare, what colour your skin happens to\nbe, because tolerance is important\u2026You\nshould know what has happened, what\ncan happen and you need to look out so\nthat it never happens again.\u201d\nSome of you might remember the\nBosnian Genocide in July 1995. One\nof the reasons that it wasn\u2019t worse was\nbecause the world had learned part of\nthe lesson from the Holocaust, however\nmorbid that might sound. Unfortunately,\nthis lesson didn\u2019t help the Srebrenica\nvictims. \u201cDa se ne zaboravi (May it [the\ngenocide] never be forgotten)\u201d \u2013 the\nmessage of the Srebrenica survivors\nechoes in my mind. Rwanda, Sudan,\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Sri Lanka,\nKashmir, Tibet, Czeczenia, Armenia\n(please do forgive me if I have unintentionally left out some)... All those names\nspeak for themselves.\nStill, I cannot help but see the irony in\nMrs Ebert\u2019s recount \u2013 \u201cI hope we stick\nto that promise,\u201d she said. What has happened in the past 66 years? It is extremely important that each and every one of\nus know these stories, repeat them and\npledge to ourselves to never allow for\nthem to be forgotten. How many more\ntimes does history have to repeat itself?\nLearning lessons from the past\n\u201cI remember going\nback a year after\nthe war ended and\nseeing bullet and\ngrenade holes in\nevery building.\u201d\n\u201cGove\u2019s lack of\nprofessionalism was\nremarkable.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve chosen to\nbe here, so quit\nwhining\nGove\u2019s in charge? Seriously?\n\u201cI have so much work! I hate\nImperial!\u201d Heard this before?\nMmm... I thought so - there\nis a lot of this Imperial hate\naround. The same university\nthat everyone has chosen to\nattend also appears to be the\nroot of all of their misfortunes\nand unhappiness.\nThis viewpoint is flawed and\nunhealthy in a number of ways.\nThe most obvious comment to\nmake is that university is not\nin any way compulsory, and being in one of the world\u2019s best\nis a fantastic opportunity. I\ndon\u2019t see how anyone could\naccept a place at a university\nin which they don\u2019t want to be.\nI mean the choice was always\nyours.\nImperial is not something\nto hate, because in essence\nit is not a thing; it is an institution within which people\ncan further their knowledge\nof science, engineering and\nmedicine. I may be being a bit\npompous here, but the point is\nthat there is nothing to hate. I\ndon\u2019t really see Imperial as a\nbig monster trying to force anyone to join or to do anything\nactually. If you don\u2019t want to\nwork you can choose not too.\nThe place should not be de-monised, as it is the people\nthemselves that make it what\nit is.\nFundamentally it must not\nbe the centre of the student\u2019s\nuniverse. We live in London after all. Don\u2019t you think a lot of\npeople would find themselves\nquite content studying in one\nof the world\u2019s ten best universities whilst living in central\nLondon?\nThis brings me to my final\npoint, a place to study at Imperial College is worth a lot.\nI\u2019m not talking about money,\neven though it IS very expen-sive. For every student here\nthere is probably at least one\nother that has been left to find\nsomewhere else to study. So if\nyou don\u2019t want to be here, let\nsomeone who does take your\nplace.\nNo one likes working as such\nbut that doesn\u2019t excuse hating,\nor pretending to hate, a place\nwhere we\u2019ve all chosen to be.\nWilliam Seez\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\nAngry Geek\nNaida Dzigal\n\n"

    "content": "Business Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFELIX 15\nBUSINESS\nA look into the Bank of\nEngland\u2019s monetary policy\nShiang Jin Chin argues that the central bank\u2019s critics on the right are wrong to\nadvocate fiscal tightening in the midst of a weak economy and high unemployment\nT\nhe Bank of England (BoE)\nhas kept rates at record\nlows of half a per cent for\nalmost two years. Its \u2018quantitative easing\u2019 has purchased assets totaling \u00a3200 billion in the\nlast eighteen months. Interest in this extremely loose monetary policy sparked\nrecently when the latest UK Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) figures showed an\nannualised rise of 3.7% in December\n\u2013 above the already high previously\nforecast of 3.4%. A loose monetary\npolicy may have two severe side effects.\nFirstly, it risks overheating the economy,\ncreating bubbles in the stock market and\nproperty markets that force the economy\ninto downturn upon bursting. Secondly,\nit broadens the monetary base; a cause\nof high inflation.\nInflation in price levels in any particular currency may be mainly caused\nby two factors. The external factor\nconsists of rises in world commodities\nprices and changes in exchange rates of\na country. The internal factor consists of\nincreased demand in nominal terms; an\nexpansion in the monetary base or a rise\nin taxation. The recent inflation of the\nSterling may be attributed largely to a\nspike in commodity prices (The Economist commodity-price index in Sterling\nterms shows a rise of 41.3%) and the\nVAT increase of earlier this year. The\nextent to which the looseness of the\nBank of England policy has also contributed to the current, dangerously high\nlevels of inflation has attracted significant media and political interest lately.\nUK GDP growth for 2010 is expected\nto be 1.6%, further hit by the severe\nweather in December which saw the\nworst retail sales figures recorded in\nrecent years. The unemployment rate\nstill stands high at 7.9%, the average\npay rise last year is reported to be 2.1%,\nand there is a pay freeze across the public sector. These figures show, firstly,\nthat the fundamental economy is still\nso weak that we need a loose monetary\npolicy; and secondly, that the demand\nfor goods is still weak. The latter means\nthat inflation is unlikelypushed up by\ninternal demands. A further look at the\nbroad money figure shows that the total\namount of money available in the market had decreased from \u00a32,228 billion to\n\u00a32,176 billion in 2010. All of this means\nthat this inflation was hardly caused by\nthe broadening of the money base. Does\nthis mean then, that the broad money\nbase is contracting when the Bank of\nEngland keeps a loose monetary policy?\nYes \u2013 and the answer for that contradictory outcome is simple. The official bank rate is the interest rate that\nthe Bank of England charges banks for\nsecured overnight lending. Quantitative\neasing measures increase the buying of\ngovernment bonds and financial assets\nfrom commercial banks, both leading\nto increased capacity of the commercials to lend. The decision to increase\nlending activities, however, still lies\nbetween the demand of the market and\nthe willingness of the banks. The latest trend in lending published by the\nBank of England showed that for the\nthree months between September and\nNovember 2010, despite a \u00a32.2 billion increase in the amount of lending\nto individuals (most of which goes to\npurchasing houses and has little effect\non CPI), the business lending has decreased by \u00a35.3 billion.\nGiven that the fundamental economy\nis still weak and the latest inflation is\nnot caused by loose monetary policy,\nthe only reason for the Bank of England to tighten policy is when bubbles\nare created in property and stock mar-kets. Perhaps the only place where we\nsaw the significant effect of the Bank\nof England\u2019s actions was in the reversal of House Price Index and FTSE\n100 downward trends. The average\nhouse price, which saw its lows around\n\u00a3148,000 in February 2009 has climbed\nup to \u00a3162,763 recently. But there is\nno bubble here. The FTSE 100 index,\nwhich represents 81 per cent of the UK\nstock market, had recorded its low of\n3493 in March 2009 but trekked back\nup to 5896 points this month. A bubble\nmight be forming in stock market, but\ntightening the monetary policy now will\ndo more harm than good.\nSeven months ago, when giving a\nspeech in Liverpool regarding the rise\nof the CPI, Paul Fisher, a member of\nthe Monetary Policy Committee of the\nBoE was quoted saying that, \u201cgiven the\nexpected degree of spare capacity in the\neconomy [\u2026] and that the temporary\nfactors should wear off, the most likely\noutcome is that inflation falls back to\nbelow target over the next couple of\nyears. On that basis it was sensible not\nto try and offset the recent rise in inflation by tightening policy.\u201d His statement\nremains true today, and if the Bank of\nEngland worries about creating bubbles\nin markets, it always has other measures\nto deal with the problems without altering its monetary policy.\nFriday 28 January 2011\nThe fundamental\neconomy is still so\nweak that we need a\nloose monetary poli-cy; inflation is unlikely to be pushed up by\ninternal demands\n\u201c\nAhhh, so this is how they make chocolate coins\n\n"

Period of time when 3 heads differently (3)\nO\nne of the stories that has\nemerged over the transfer window period is the\nclash between certain\npremier league manag-ers. Houllier is such a manager, who\nhas received criticism due to his conduct over the signing of Darren Bent\nand what is seen as an insulting bid for\nBlackpool\u2019s Charlie Adam.\nBruce was particularly insulted that\nHoullier neglected to give him a phone\ncall, leaving Sunderland less than half\nof the transfer window to replace Bent.\nWhile the transfer is strange given the\nleague positions of the teams, perhaps\nBent simply wanted the pay rise Villa\noffered him.\nHolloway is taking negotiations into\nthe press, criticising the teams who have\noffered what he perceives to be low\nbids, such as Villa and Liverpool. However, Houllier claimed that he was being\ntargeted because Holloway\u2019s criticism\nseemed to exclude Liverpool manager\nKenny Dalglish. This, I think is a bit\nunfair on Holloway, who perhaps didn\u2019t\nwant to criticise a legendary player and\nmanager.\nHowever, I feel that the other criticism\nof Houllier, this time coming from Steve\nBruce over Darren Bent\u2019s move from\nSunderland to Villa, was justified. Bent\nis a great player and I\u2019m sure he will\nbe sorely missed by Sunderland. These\nevents raise a deeper issue. Is the establishment hostile towards foreign manag-ers? Is the fact that Houllier is French\na factor which means English managers\nfeel it is OK to criticise him excessively\nin the media? I would argue no in this\ncase. This is a country which has the rare\nsituation of a foreign manager managing\nthe national team.\nIn Italy, for example, the top jobs are\ngenerally given to Italian managers or\nmanagers who have been in Italy for the\nvast majority of their playing careers,\nsuch as Inter\u2019s Leonardo. In Italy\u2019s top\nfour, Leonardo is the only non-Italian\nmanager, whereas in the current top four\nof the Premiership, there are no English\nmanagers and only one British man-ager, with two Italians and a Frenchman. Therefore it is clear that those\nrunning the clubs even have a positive\nbias to foreign managers. Furthermore,\nit is clear that a manager like Wenger is\ngenerally respected across the board, despite being French.\nIt is clear that everyone is simply protecting their own interests, and that Houllier is attempting to play mind games but\nlosing at them very badly, as he appears\nto be simply clutching at straws to silence\ncriticism about the way he has operated\non the transfer market. Houllier allegedly\nbroke regulations by contacting a player\nwithout permission from the club, shown\nby the suspiciously short time between\nBent\u2019s transfer request and his announced\nmove. If this is true, which it seems to be,\nHoullier has used what he labelled \u2018racism\u2019 as a PR tool which is wholly unacceptable from a person in any position,\nlet alone one in the public eye in one of\nthe world\u2019s most followed sports.\nIf, in over six years at Liverpool, he\nwas unable to grasp transfer regulations\nor build up a reputation which other\nmanagers respect, then citing xenophobia when he is criticised will only cover\nup a deeper problem.\nAre foreign managers\nvictimised in the Premier\nLeague?\nRiaz Agahi\nDon\u2019t wave your finger Houllier, it\u2019s unbecoming of an English gen... oh wait\n\n"

So if you fancy yellowtail tuna,\nrazor clam or some fatty tuna, alter the\nfollowing recipe as required, because\nI\u2019m sticking to the basic Californian roll.\nGet yourself equipped with:\n\u2022 A rolling mat (Makisu) *\n\u2022 Nori seaweed sheets *\n\u2022 3 cups sushi rice *\n\u2022 3 \u00bc cups water\n\u2022 1/3 cup rice vinegar *\n\u2022 3 tbsp sugar\n\u2022 1 tbsp salt\n\u2022 Several crabsticks (defrosted)\n\u2022 A semi-ripe avocado\n\u2022 A cucumber\n\u2022 Wasabi *\n\u2022 Soy Sauce\n\u2022 A sharp knife\n* These products are available in Sainsbury\u2019s or Tesco, but you can also find\nthem at Japanese grocery shops such\nas Japan Centre (14-16 Regent Street,\nSW1Y 4PH. Nearest tube station: Piccadilly Circus). Some of these items are\noptional i.e. nori seaweed and a rolling\nmat is not needed when making nigiri\n(sushi rice topped with a slice of fish)\nFirst, you need to prepare the sushi\nrice. Rice is generally prepared with a\n1:1 ratio with one part rice to one part\nwater. As soon as the rice begins to boil,\nlower the heat and let it simmer for\n20 minutes. Remove the rice from the\nheat. Prepare the rice vinegar mixture\nby mixing the rice vinegar, sugar and\nsalt together on low heat. This is added\nwhilst the rice is cooling. Gently add the\nmixture to the rice while stirring with a\nwooden spoon to evenly distribute the\nmix. Fan the rice mixture to cool and remove the moisture of the rice, giving it\na shiny look. Now that the rice is ready,\nthe main ingredients can be prepared.\nSplit the crab sticks by pulling them\nlengthways into long strips approximately half the original size. Halve the\navocado with a large knife, twisting it\naround the stone to separate. Remove\nthe stone and cut the avocado into 1cm x\n1cm long strips. Cut the cucumber into\n1cm x 1cm long strips also.\nNow take a sheet of nori seaweed and\nplace it on the rolling mat. Spread about\na cup of rice on the sheet of nori, leaving\none inch of space on the other end (see\nthe top right photo). The rice does not\nneed to be packed tightly, and should be\nless than \u00bc inch thick, so don\u2019t worry\nif you can see the blackness of the sea-H omemade sushi\nSource, prepare and make your own sushi, made easy by Dana Li\nweed through the rice. Less is more.\nPlace the avocado slices on top of the\nrice near the edge that does not have uncovered nori (see photo), ensuring that\nthe length of the rice is covered. Add the\ncrabstick and cucumber strips likewise.\nNow here we go with the rolling.\nSlowly fold the mat over, tucking the\nend of the nori to start a roll. Keep lifting up the mat as you go to compress the\nsushi roll. Lessen the pressure slightly to\nstraighten out the roll, if needed. Then\ncontinue rolling with medium pressure\nuntil it is complete\nRemove the sushi roll from mat and\nimmediately cut into 6 or 8 even pieces.\nImportant tip: keep the knife very moist\nto prevent sticking, remoistening before\neach cut. Cut in one swift downward\nmovement. Don\u2019t shear the sushi by\ncutting to and fro, as this will lead to an\nawkward shape. Turn the pieces on end\nand arrange on platter.\nTip: Some sushi bars make an \u201cinside\nout\u201d California roll. The rice is spread\nall over the nori (there is no uncovered\nedge as above). The nori is turned over\nonto cling film so it is rice side down.\nThe ingredients are placed on one edge\nand the roll is rolled as before. After\nrolling, the roll is rolled in toasted sesame seeds prior to cutting. Optionally,\nflying fish roe can be used in place of\nthe sesame seeds (it actually tastes bet-ter, but I can only find it at Japan Centre\nand is a bit pricey).\nIf that all sounds a bit too much and\nyou\u2019d rather be served than worked,\nhere are some recommended places\naround London for sushi for all types of\nbudgets.\nukaaa/flickr\n100 ways to eat eggs!\nActually just 3\u2026\nby George McIntyre\nApparently eggs are the ultimate fast\nfood. Some of you may already know\nthis. In fact I know one guy who eats\nscrambled eggs nearly everyday. Good\neffort, Steve!\nAnyway, the fact is they are high in\nprotein, low in fat and carbohydrates\nand therefore very good for you! Here\nare three simple recipes that will get\neven the worst cooks of you making\neggs like a pro.\nPoached egg\nThe simplest of the eggs in my opinion,\nall you need here is a fresh egg, some\nvinegar and a little bit of hot water.\nBoil some water and pour about 3-4cm into a pan and heat until just boiled.\nMake sure to add a good glug of vinegar \u2013 this is very, very important!\nNow add your eggs and turn the heat\nright down.\nCook to your preference. If you like it\nrunny, it will take about 2-3 minutes and\nthe top of the egg should have a pinkish\ntinge. Enjoy!\nScrambled egg\nProbably the quickest of the lot, all you\nneed here is a decent non-stick (ish) pan,\na couple of good eggs, some butter and\nsome salt and pepper.\nMelt a blob of butter into a hot pan.\nWhisk 2-3 eggs in a bowl and add a decent sprinkle of salt and pepper.\nPour the egg into pan. The pan should\nbe hot enough so that the egg cooks\nstraight away so make sure you scramble it! The cooking process should take\nless than two minutes.\nAlpine egg\nYou might not have heard of these beauties but a good alpine egg can be amaz-ing. What you need here is an egg, some\nbutter, some grated cheese and a rame-kin. If you don\u2019t have this, just a normal\ncoffee cup will do.\nButter the ramekin or cup and put half\nthe cheese on the bottom.\nCrack the egg on top the cheese then\ncarefully sprinkle the rest of the cheese\nso the egg is totally covered. Add a fair\namount of salt and pepper.\nYou can add chives, spring onion or\nfinely chopped onion for extra flavour.\nHave your oven on gas 5 or 190\u00b0C and\nwhack in the ramekin for about 10 minutes max. If you\u2019re using the coffee cup\nput it in the microwave instead for about\n2-3 minutes.\nI suggest using the cup in the microwave method purely for speed.\nOut of all the recipes I strongly recommend this one. This is my personal\nfavourite, its quick, easy and if you add\na bit of salad (yeah, right) or have it with\nsome bread it can be a decent meal.\nSo there you have it. Four ways to use\nthose eggs in your flatmate\u2019s fridge.\nEnjoy.\nWhere to source\nyour sushi:\nBUDGET (<\u00a310)\nDelicatessen Yoshino\nA takeaway sushi deli with a\nvast range at budget prices.\nBrilliant for sushi cravings without breaking the bank.\n59 Shaftesbury Avenue\nLondon W1D 6LF.\nMID-RANGE (\u00a315-25)\nKulu Kulu Sushi\n39 Thurloe Place SW7 2HB.\nSushi Atari-Ya\nReplacing a Heston favourite,\nSushi Hiro, they supply the fish\nfor most Japanese restaurants\nin London so the quality here\nis outstanding.\n1 Station Parade,\nEaling, W5 3LD.\nPRICEY (\u00a330+)\nYashin Sushi\nThis recently opened restaurant is just behind High Street\nKensington.\n1a Argyll Road,\nLondon W8 7DB\n\n"

He confirmed that\nthe affected students would have their\nfunding returned to the EPSRC minimum plus the London living allowance.\nHowever the situation for two of the students who are on Airbus-funded grants\nis not yet clear.\nAlex Kendall, President of Imperial\nCollege Union, has said that he does\n\u201cnot think it is right that any department can cut salary half way through\nthe financial year,\u201d and has asked the\nPro-Rector (Education and Academic\nServices) Professor Julia Buckingham\nto look into the issue.\nThe lack of communication has also\nbeen heavily criticised by the students\naffected. Oliver Rhodes, a PhD representative in the Department of Aeronautics, said, \u201cif a meeting had been\narranged and the students been properly\ninformed I doubt there would have been\nan issue.\u201d\nProfessor Aliabadi explained that failure to notify students was due to \u201cstaff\nworkloads, accentuated by staff absences through sickness\u201d. He described\nthe lack of communication as an unfortunate oversight and added that, \u201cin no\nway have we ever attempted to pay students at anything other than the fair and\nproper rate.\u201d\nA similar situation arose regarding\nthe payment of postgraduate students in\nthe Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) last term. Students were confused over whether their\nfunding included payment for their four\nhours of required teaching activities per\nweek. The department was forced to introduce a new measure to reduce the cur-From the Archive\nFew will remember the glorious days\nwhen a working day at Imperial College was limited between the times of\n9.30am and 5.30pm. However proposals to axe this \u2018slackers\u2019 paradise were\nbrought forward in the early nineties,\ncausing great agitation amongst students\nand staff alike. Sound familiar?\nA trip to the Felix archives reveals that\nthe first whispers of the possibility of extended hours came in early November of\n1990, with the \u2018Working Party on College Days\u2019, a committee set up to look\ninto the matter, announced that Imperial lacked teaching space and timetable\nclashes were becoming the norm, hinting that lengthening the working day\nwas the only viable solution. Almost instantly the cries of outrage were heard,\nand published, with critics pointing out\nthat societies and humanities (the things\nthat make the science overkill at Imperial bearable) would suffer the most and\ncould even crumble altogether under\nthese new plans.\nThe next encounter between bureaucrats and students occurred at the the\nUnion General Meeting (UGM), which\nenjoyed its largest student turnout thanks\nto the threat of a longer working day, one\nof the items on the agenda. Straight off\nthe bat, theWorking Party committee was\nkeen to emphasise how it represented the\ninterests of students as well as staff and\nmanagement. However, as I\u2019m sure everyone will be pleased to hear, they were\nmade to look ridiculous when the Royal\nCollege of Science handed over a survey\nthey conducted, where an overwhelming\n646 replies stated that they believed college days should remain the same.\nThere were many practical ways of\nmaximising the time already available at\nImperial, as pointed out by an editorial\nshortly after the UGM took place, pointing out that if departments cut down on\ncurrent wasted hours, there would be no\nneed for timetable changes. The fact\nthat in many courses, material covered\nby different options and lectures tended\nto overlap, caused an unthinkable number of hours unavailable for productive\nactivity. Another suggestion was to\nmake use of the expertise of the Humanities Department, which had more experience in time-management, rather than\npunishing them by reducing the hours\navailable for students to pursue the options they offered. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu doesn\u2019t seem\nto cover it anymore.\nThe arguments were put to the test\nagain in early December of 1990, when\nthe Students\u2019 Union held a referendum on the proposals. It won\u2019t come\nas much of a surprise to learn that the\nresult came out as 457 to 59 against the\nincreased time and it seemed that this\nmajor indication from the student body\nwould finally lay the issue to rest. This\nwas the general consensus amongst students with many a strong worded letter\nbeing written to Felix, enjoying the apparent victory over the Working Party,\nwho had \u201cbeen ominously silent for\nquite a while now. It\u2019s tempting to think\nthat maybe the resounding \u2018f**k off\u2019\ngiven to them in the referendum held\nbefore chrimbo hols has halted them in\ntheir tracks\u201d.\nIt brings about quite a sense of sadness\nto see lines such as \u201cIt shows that if we\ncan rise above the rabid apathy\u2026we can\nchange things. It might also show College that they can\u2019t do what the hell they\nlike without considering what we think\nabout it\u201d as we can see from looking at\nour timetables in 2011, that College has\nindeed done whatever it pleases. This\nmakes the proposals for extended hours\ncurrently being examined seem scarily\npossible as we have reason to question,\nyet again, how much attention senior\nmanagement at Imperial pay to the voices of students and staff alike.\nChanges to College hours\nDeepka Rana\nrent bursary and have students explicitly\nearn their lost money. After this latest\nrun of events in the Aeronautics Department, Alex Kendall highlights that such\nproblems \u201cmay be more widespread.\u201d\nHe continued \u201cThe department has a lot\nof explaining to do to its students and\nthe Union is looking into whether this is\nhappening in other departments.\u201d\nMusictech @ Ministry\nof Sound: Tuesday 1st\nFebruary\n\u00a35\nFor tickets contact Adam\non 07891 390923 [or email\nmusictech@imperial.ac.uk]\nfacebook.com/musictech\n\u201cImperial\u2019s finest DJs take to\nthe decks in the superclub\nfor a night of\nawesome fun and exclusive\nmusic.

It increases this\nyear on year with inflation, as\ndetermined by the Treasury GDP\ndeflators; a measure of general inflation. For example, for\n2010/11 it increased by 2.25%.\nUniversities have the flexibility to\nfund their students\u2019 PhDs from\na variety of sources but at least\n50% of the minimum stipend\nmust come from the funds of a\nsingle Council.\nImperial has its own recommended minimum stipend, which\nis approved by the Management Board. For 2010/11 it is\n\u00a315,367. It is not directly linked\nto any one measure of inflation.\nAccording to the EPSRC, their\nrate is set to increase at 1.5%\nfor 2011/12 and then 2.5% for\n2012/13. The College have said\nthat while they would not want to\nanticipate their future minimum\nrate, it was possible that the two\namounts would reach parity in\ncoming years.\nMan, Felix used to be way better, damn I miss the 90s...\nFriday 28 january 2011\n\n"

After a frustrating couple of years trying to drum up interest amongst\nour female players, finally things have clicked\ninto place. Nan and I were back after some\nbusy times (we combined to win the BUCS\nWomens doubles bronze medal in 2007). We\nalso welcomed Trang to the team, who was a\nmixed doubles bronze medallist for Cambridge\nUniversity in the same year.\nIt was time for us to combine forces and\nmake an assault on this year\u2019s BUCS Womens\nleague. We were buoyed by the knowledge that\nLondon Metropolitan University were absent\nthis year. They had previously recruited players\nfrom China including former Olympic bronze\nmedallist Tong Fei-Ming even though she\u2019s\nover 40 years old! Middlesex were also noticeably weaker without their former England top\ntenners. Lack of interest amongst their players\nforced them to pull out halfway through the\nseason. In 2008, when only the top two teams\nin the south east could go through to the next\nround, we finished third below these two teams.\nThis time not only are they absent, but the top 4\ngo through making our lives a whole lot easier!\nAlthough we needn\u2019t worry about that considering the results we have had this year.\nFirst up were LSE who were so keen they\nturned up half an hour before us and were practicing hard even before we got our kit on! But\nTrang and I won our first matches comfortably.\nAs they adapted to our games and the condi-tions, they provided sturdier opposition forcing\nTrang to drop a game. But in the end it was a\n5-0 win to us.\nNext Nan and Trang travelled to King\u2019s College. The venue wasn\u2019t your typical table tennis hall. It appeared to be the underpass of a\nrailway bridge transformed into a sports hall, or\nat least an attempt to transform it into a sports\nhall. But that wasn\u2019t enough to distract our\ngirls. They were given a good test by King\u2019s\nbut they ultimately came out on top 5-0 again.\nGiving Trang a well deserved break, Nan and\nI took on Essex University who were without\nsome of their former England international\nplayers this year. They gave us a few troubles\nearly on, I seemed to be unusually nervous\nmaking too many mistakes but we won this\nmatch 5-0 too. I felt a bit harsh considering\nthey had travelled for two and half hours only\nto get a thrashing from us. But that\u2019s sport and\nnothing beats that winning feeling!\nNan and I played the first of two tough\nmatches against UCL. One of the opposition\nplayers was ridiculously muscly by a normal\ntable tennis player\u2019s standards, confusing me\nenough to relinquish a 2-0 lead and lose the\ngame against her! However Nan was brilliant\nand despite narrowly losing the doubles match,\nwe won the tie 3-2.\nFinally in a battle to top the south east division Trang and I played Kent. Unfortunately\nNan had to pull out of this tie at the last moment due to a nasty wrist injury (smacking your\nhand against the edge of a table tennis table at\nhigh speed is never pleasant!). A combination\nof nerves due to the occasion and post-Christ-mas rustiness meant I played poorly winning\nonly one of my singles matches knowing I was\ncapable of more. With Trang also winning one\nsingles match, it came down to the deciding\ndoubles rubber. We battled hard but we lost the\ntie 2-3.\nAs we look forward to the next round we are\nsafe in the knowledge that we are capable of\nmuch more and can go deep into the compe-tition. I am delighted with the strength of our\nteam and the progress we have made. A huge\ncongratulations and thank you to Nan and\nTrang for the contributions they have made this\nyear. This is the best chance we have ever had\nof winning the BUCS championship, maybe\nit is too ambitious at this stage but nothing is\nimpossible!\nAnusha Seneviratne\nTable Tennis\nLadies 1st 5 - 0 LSE 1st\nLadies 1st 5 - 0 King\u2019s College 1st\nLadies 1st 5 - 0 Essex 1st\nLadies 1st 3 - 2 UCL 1st\nLadies 1st 2 - 3 Kent 1st\nin London, Crown Jewels. \u201cTraining at a club\nlevel involves working on teamwork and tac-tics.

If he helps her, she will let him go.\nThe relationship is superbly voiced by the\ntwo leading actors: Levi as the narcissistic but\noften clueless thief and Moore as the lovable,\nna\u00efve and cute little princess. They make a\ngreat team and there is plenty of humour between them to keep things fresh. Some jokes\nare more childish and immature than others,\nbut there are more than enough enjoyable\ndevelopments to keep the older members of\nthe audience hooked. Mother Grothel, one of\nDisney\u2019s very few non-magical villains, relies\nbrilliantly on her master manipulation skills\nand passive-aggressive words to mess with\neveryone\u2019s heads. Murphy has the perfect\nvoice for the role: her sly intelligence and uncanny ability to work every single situation\nto her own advantage makes her one\nslick villain.\nFilms like The\nLion King,\nAladdin, and\nBeauty\nand the\nBeast\nhave\nCosting Disney a whooping $260 million in\nproduction budget alone, it comes as no surprise that the studio has announced they will\nno longer make animated films based on fairytales after the release of their latest, Tangled.\nIt\u2019s time for the original ideas of Pixar to thrive\nand Disney knows it. The most recent Disney\nnon-Pixar efforts haven\u2019t exactly turned huge\nprofits and, as the bar is continuously raised,\nthe cost of animation isn\u2019t getting any cheaper.\nGood news, then, that the film they\u2019re releasing as their fairytale send-off is actually\nof a very high standard, mixing a well-known\nchildren\u2019s story with some gripping action,\nadventure and song-and-dance numbers we\nhave all come to adore. There are the usual\nDisney ingredients \u2013 a young princess in trou-ble, a wisecracking, handsome princely man, a\nwicked woman who starts off the story by creating a mess of a situation, cheery tunes, and\nfunny supporting characters. It\u2019s really no different from many Disney classics, but Tangled\nrecycles this well worn-out set of plot devices\nand still makes the whole film surprisingly\nwatchable.\nFirst things first: the $260 million is money\nwell spent. Tangled looks stunning and the artwork cannot be faulted here. It may be one of\nthe best looking of all Disney animated films.\nUnlike Disney\u2019s previous works, Tangled is\nnot a purely hand-drawn animation, but a com-puter-animation integration that truly shows\nthe modern appeal.\nThe plot follows the classic fairytale char-acter, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) whose hair is\na central theme of the story and is beautifully\nanimated, flowing across the screen in most\nscenes. When Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) discovers that the newborn baby princess\nRapunzel\u2019s hair has a special power of healing that includes maintaining youth, Gothel\nkidnaps the poor princess, locks her away in\na tower and raises the baby as her own. The\npower of her hair only remains when it\u2019s not\ncut \u2013 so it\u2019s important to grow her beautiful\nlong golden hair. Eighteen years later, a local\nbandit, Flynn (Zachary Levi), fleeing from\nsome palace guards, runs into a forest,\nand stumbles upon Rapunzel\u2019s place of\nimprisonment. At first, they get off to a\nbad start \u2013 mainly when she attacks him\nand holds him prisoner. But, when\nit transpires that she is\ndying to venture out\ninto the world, she\nstrikes up a deal with\ncome up with so many epic, catchy tunes that\nit would be simply unrealistic to expect the\nsame sort of breakthrough musical standard,\nbut Tangled does come up with its fair share\nof likable songs, though they\u2019re nothing on the\nenduring classics of early Disney.\nThere is a lot of hectic action in the middle\nsequence \u2013 a lot of which is made head-spin-ning by the eye-popping special effects. The\n3D is once again not something groundbreaking and doesn\u2019t add a whole lot to the film\u2019s\ncontent. It\u2019s more distracting than anything\nelse \u2013 Rapunzel\u2019s hair flows swimmingly no\nmatter what and her big eyes sparkle even\nwithout the added extra dimension.\nDespite the directors\u2019 attempts to be crea-tive, the final moments are a tad daft, and the\ncheesiness surrounding its finale can be un-bearable. It doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of\nsense either, and relies on the argument\nof \u201clove conquers all\u201d as its final mot-to. Though it\u2019s an easy way out, a\nneat conclusion with a happy mes-sage, something the kids will no\ndoubt be pleased with but most\nviewers will be left wanting a\nlittle more.

From Spaced\u2019s take\non Muldoon\u2019s \u201cclever girl\u2026\u201d line to the iconic water-ripple shots reproduced innumerable times, this film\nhas become deeply ingrained in cinematic history.\nStarring Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum\nas the only people to ever make paleontonlogists\nand mathematicians look badass, this film stormed\nbox offices to become the most financially successful film of its time. And it\u2019s easy to see why. Even\nafter so many years that have seen huge leaps in\nCGI technology, Jurassic Park remains timeless, with\nshots that are still as visually impressive now as they\nwere at its release. As a testament to Spielberg\u2019s\nrefusal to cut corners, the painstakingly constructed\nanimatronic dinosaurs used for close-ups have not\naged at all.\nIt is typical Spielberg in every aspect, with a rousing John Williams score and a character arc that\nsees the gruff Dr. Alan Grant (Neill) learning to open\nhis heart and take responsibility for the kids left in\nhis care \u2013 thereby satisfying Spielberg\u2019s incessant\ndaddy issues. In between the sweeping shots of\nCosta Rica and the highly convincing Scientific Facts\nthat allow the recreation of dinosaurs to be possible,\nJurassic Park is a triumph of action and suspense.\nThere are few scenes more utterly nail-biting than the\n\u2018Velociraptors In The Kitchen\u2019 scene, which builds to\none of the finest, most impressive finales in Spielberg\u2019s career, and rounds off a spectacular cinematic\nmilestone of a film.

The review panel, led by Professors Murray Selkirk and Andy Purvis,\naims to submit its recommendations to\nthe Science Studies Committee in late\nApril, after an initial period of consultation in January and a follow-up period\nin March. However, opponents of the\nstaff cuts in the Life Sciences Department have criticised the panel for not offering enough time for student submissions in the initial consultation and for\na general lack of information about the\non-goings of the review.\nAs previously reported by Felix, Head\nof the Life Sciences Department Professor Ian Owens confirmed at a public\nmeeting last December that the teaching\nreview would be held in January, with\nthe aim of improving teaching, aided by\nadditional student input. Up until now,\nhowever, there has been little information released about the review. Professor\nOwens failed to respond to an email enquiring about the review in early January whilst Union President Alex Kendall\nclaimed that the department has left the\nUnion out of the loop: \u201cThere has also\nbeen no attempt to include the Students\u2019\nUnion in this review so far.\u201d\nStaff within the department have also\nfelt left in the dark. One staff member,\nwho wished to remain anonymous, told\nFelix that he \u201chad absolutely no idea\u201d\nhow the review was proceeding.\nProfessors Selkirk and Purvis have\nsought to reassure both staff and students by providing Felix with an update\nof the situation. They confirmed that\nthe panel had met twice already \u2013 \u201cwith\nconsiderable work being conducted by\nsub-groups in between\u201d \u2013 and signalled\nthat the next meeting of the panel would\nbe in February after the responses to\nthe questionnaire had been collated. In\nMarch a second consultation period will\nstart, \u201cduring which we will be soliciting comments on our proposals.\u201d The\nReview Panel will then decide which\nof the suggestions it wants to incorpo-rate. The final stage of the process is\nthe Panel\u2019s report to the Science Studies\nCommittee, which meets on May 17th.\nProfessors Selkirk and Purvis told Felix\nthat they \u201caim to submit [their] proposals four weeks before that date\u201d.\nThe review group is made up of two\nco-chairs, Professors Selkirk and Purvis,\nseven other members of staff heavily involved in teaching (three from the Biology degree and four from Biochemistry)\nand a representative from the undergraduate office.\nIn terms of the direction and aims of\nthe review, Professors Selkirk and Purvis\ntold Felix that it was too early to make\nspecific comments but that there had\nbeen \u201cvery wide-ranging discussions\u201d\nand that the questionnaire would give\nstudents an indication of what the panel\nare discussing. They also confirmed that\nthe panel intended for \u201cstudents arriving\nin October 2011 [to] be the first to see\nthe changes throughout their degrees\u201d,\nbut also said that they were primarily\ntaking a long-term view.\nThe first sign that the review had\nstarted was on the weekend of the 22nd\nof January when a questionnaire was\ncirculated to staff in the Life Sciences\nDepartment, which they were asked to\ncomplete by the 31st. The questionnaire\ncovers a range of topics relating to degrees in the Life Sciences Department.\nThe Union responded positively to the\nquestionnaire saying that the \u201cquestions\nseem dedicated to finding out a wide\nrange of aspects of the undergraduate\ndegree.\u201d But one member of staff, afore-mentioned, was less impressed by the\nrange of questions calling it \u201cbland\u201d and\nsaid that it only requested \u201cvague opinions on what is OK.\u201d\nThe survey was made available on\nWednesday on Blackboard for undergraduates in the department, asking them for\ntheir opinions on the format of lectures,\nclasses and tutorials and the attributes of\nthe degree programme in general. Students have until the 31st to complete the\nsurvey. An introductory statement from\nProfessors Purvis and Selkirk reads: \u201cWe\nparticularly value your views now, so\nthey can feed into the review process at\nan earlier stage.\u201d\nUnion President Alex Kendall, a key\nfigure behind the opposition to the Life\nSciences cuts, \u201cencouraged all undergraduates who are able to to fill it in\u201d,\nbut also criticized the Review Panel for\noffering less than a week for students to\nprovide their opinions and comments.\n\u201cConsidering the work we did on\ntrying to spread information about the\nrestructure I am disappointed that [the\nUnion] has not been included,\u201d said\nKendall, \u201cI am also critical of the lack\nof any reference to the restructure in the\nquestions or in the responses from the\nChairs.\u201d\nWhether further developments in the\nreview will improve the opinions of\nboth students and staff towards a department which has seen some severely unwanted attention as of late will depend\non the careful handling of a situation\nthat is growing ever more delicate as\ntime passes.\nMatthew Colvin\nReview timetable\nThe current questionnaire will\nclose on the 31st of January.\nThe panel has met twice already and will meet again in\nFebruary after the responses\nto the questionnaire have been\ncollated. In March a second\nconsultation period will start,\nduring which staff and students\nwill be invited to offer comments on the panel\u2019s propos-als. The comments will then\nbe taken into consideration\nand possibly incorporated into\nthe proposals. The final stage\nof the process is the Panel\u2019s\nreport to the Science Studies\nCommittee, which meets on\nMay 17th. The proposals will\nbe submitted to that committee 4 weeks before it meets.\nAfonso Campos\nFriday 28 january 2011\n\n"

It represents a considerable evolution of the existing HTML standard, which is\ndetermined to transform the web as we know it.\nAccording to the World Wide Web Consortium\n(W3C), the logo \u201cstands [as] strong and true,\nresilient and universal as the markup you write.\nIt shines as bright and as bold as the forward-thinking, dedicated web developers you are.

Indeed, one\nof HTML5\u2019s most widely discussed new features has been the inclusion of the <video>\ntag, designed to standardise the way in which\nwebpages handle video without the need for\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Last.fm\nLast.fm brings personalised radio to your pocket\npal courtesy of an iPhone app. Streaming radio has\nnever been easier.\nThe Android version of the Last.fm app lacks the polish of it\u2019s iOS cousin, but thankfully all the goods are\nthere. And it\u2019ll even let you scrobble music on the go.\nAndroid - Last.fm\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane?\nNo it\u2019s super-HTML5!\nLouis Constant\nIf you\u2019ve ever carried a MacBook Pro out and\nabout with you, you\u2019ll know that a laptop bag is\nessential. Considering you\u2019re carrying around\nthe best part of \u00a31000 at least, when it comes\nto a bag you\u2019re going to want something well\nbuilt and with decent padding, God-forbid you\ndrop the thing. Be.ez thinks it has the answer\nwith the LE rush, a range of Apple laptop bags\nthat combine lightweight materials with silicon\npadding.\nAvailable in three colours, the LE rush features a main central compartment for your lap-top, with a padded band along the bottom and\nup the edges of the bag, which provides impact\nprotection to the edges of the laptop. There are\nalso two slip pockets and a Velcro closeable\nEz laptop protection for those in LE Rush\nSamuel Gibbs\nplug-ins of any sort. However,\ndisagreements surrounding this\nfeature have given rise to much\ndebate and delay, hindering attempts to make the tag the\nnew standard for displaying online video.\nIn particular, tech heavyweights Nokia and Apple\nhave in the past publicly\nexpressed concern about\nthe specification\u2019s recommendation of support for the\nOgg video format. Following this, the recommendation\nwas removed, and thus those\nweb browsers that choose to\nsupport the HTML5 video\ntag, are free to support it using\nwhichever underlying video\nformats they wish. This, it is\nargued, defeats what was the\nmain motivation of the <vid-eo> tag in the first place \u2013 to\nhelp introduce a common, free,\nand open baseline format supported by all browsers, eliminating many of the unnecessary codecs currently required to view\nonline video.\nMore recently, while video utilising the\nHTML5 video tag (primarily using the H.264\nvideo format) has slowly begun to replace the\nwidely used Flash for video content, some of\nthe web\u2019s biggest providers of online video\nremain cautious. YouTube for instance, cites\nthe aforementioned lack of a standard video\nformat, and lack of DRM, as two issues preventing the HTML5 video tag from meeting the\nrequirements of its site. Popular US streaming\nvideo site Hulu similarly states the tag\u2019s lack\nof content protection, as well as its inability to\nprovide advertisers with viewership data, as\ntwo of its reasons for not having yet rolled out\nsupport for the new standard.\nWill the new logo spell an end to the conflict,\nproviding an ensign for corporations and web\ndevelopers alike to rally around, unite under,\nand resolve their differences? Probably not, but\nat least it\u2019s pretty.\ndocument wallet in the main compartment for\nancillary stuff.\nThe front of the bag features a Velcro-sealable, expandable pocket for things like a power\nadapter. Inside that there\u2019s also a slim line zippered pocket with two slip pockets for smaller\nitems. On the back of the bag there are also\nthree slim line slip pockets, useful for bits of\npaper you need quick access to.\nOverall the LE rush features light but hard-wearing materials, a solid construction and decent protection for your beloved laptop. Complete with a nylon shoulder strap and bespoke\nsizes for the 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pros, as\nwell as a smaller \u2018netbook\u2019 bag, the LE rush\nline deserves to be in your sights if you\u2019re looking for a slim but sturdy bag. Yours for around\n\u00a330 from all good retailers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the standard\u2019s\nstandard, a pennant for\nprogress.

I suspect, however, that the\nhype and anticipation created is where\ntheir downfall will lie. All of us were far\ntoo young to have seen the first show of\nsay \u2018Have I Got News For You\u2019 or Paxman doing his first interview but I have\nvague memories of \u2018Mock the Week\u2019\nhaving a fairly mediocre start. These\nshows however were allowed to develop\nand grow with an increasing fan base as\nthey found their feet but I have an inkling that this show, which does have the\nbare bones of great television, won\u2019t be\nallowed that space to breathe and re-group. I can see why Channel 4 has gone\nwith this approach though. The success\nof their alternative election coverage\nhas prompted 10 O\u2019Clock Live. Pissing\neveryone off by ending the Daily Show\nfrom airing every day and touting 10\nO\u2019Clock live as an alternative\nwas a mistake.\nTalk about\nsetting the bar\nfar, far too high.\nIn theory TOCL could have been comic gold with Jimmy Carr, David Mitchell and Charlie Brooker being some of\nthe funniest men in business. Oh and of\ncourse Lauren Laverne.\nTaking on Lauren Laverne just seems\nnonsensical. I suspect the thinking was\nsomething like\u2026. \u201cdon\u2019t we need a\nwoman? Oh and make her look smoking\u201d. Really people, really?\nIronically one of the major failures of\nthe show is the fact there are too many\npeople involved and with the content being divided almost evenly between them\nthe show loses any momentum it has. It\u2019s\nsuch a shame because it feels that just as\nyou start to engage it cuts to a break or\nthe next segment. As the boys begin to\nsettle into a dynamic and the wit sparkles\nwe\u2019re off on some moronic Hollywood\nreport about Sudan and the potential\nthat\u2019s just around the corner is lost.\nMitchell was easily the superstar of\nthe group being the most erudite and\ngenuinely funny. His first interview on\nthe subject of bankers made me question his ability as an interviewer but retrospectively I\u2019m not sure many people\nbeyond Dimbleby could handle a dialogue with three professional politicians whose knowledge of the topic\nfar outweighs your own. He handled David Willetts wonderfully\nand his rant was pitch perfect.\nJimmy Carr looked like live\ntelevision made him want to\ncry and the first five minutes\nwere so Jimmy heavy it was ob-What We Watched...\nThis week\u2019s TV treated us to two chilling new episodes of the brilliantly gory Silent Witness, which\nstarts with womanising Harry taking a trip to Budapest to perform a second post mortem on a Romanian prostitute who suspiciously turned up looking\ncadaverous in the River Danube. I have always considered it slightly odd that the pathologists seem to\nsingle-handedly conduct an entire murder investiga-tion, but I suppose there wouldn\u2019t be much drama if\nthey stuck to their usual mandate of messing around\nwith the victims\u2019 insides.\nThe first of these two episodes actually turned\nout to be the exception to this rule as the team got\ncaught up with the Hungarian Mafia (Police?), but as\nusual, it was packed with loads of cliff-hanging drama\nand a little [big] bit of tragedy... Your mourning will\nlast for days if you are a long-term fan \u2013 the suspense kills! Definitely one to watch if you missed it.\nAt the cutting edge of shit TV this week was Channel 4\u2019s all new series The Joy of Teen Sex \u2013 a horrifying expose of some of Britain\u2019s best ugly people. A\ngreat bullfrog of a woman proffered tips to improve\nthe taste of a man\u2019s mayonnaise and a sex doctor\ntries to convince a sixteen year old muntbag that\ncontraception is a good idea because of how much\nof a village bike she is. Later, in what the mother describes as her \u2018proudest moment yet\u2019, she eventually\ngets the implant. I hope it fucking hurts. Slag.\nThe fifth episode of Lucas and Walliams\u2019 Come\nFly With Me conformed to expectations by being almost exactly identical to the previous 4. In typical\n\u2018Little Britain\u2019 style the rather tenuous characters\nevolve last week\u2019s sketch ever so slightly by altering\na few words. Funny? Yes, in a way, but it seems to\nbe mostly catering for the playground audience and\ntheir eternal desire for something repetitive to annoy\ntheir poor teachers with. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d bother to\nOn The Box\nThis Week\nThe best shows on television\nfor the next 7 days\nvious it took him a while to relax and\ndeliver his one liners without looking\nlike he was reading from a prompter.\nBoth Carr and Brooker had trouble with\ncamera and line cues which made the\nshow look incredibly amateurish , which\nwasn\u2019t helped by the sudden switching of camera angles for seemingly no\nreason at all. Brooker, beyond his prerecorded Palin segment, shined when\nmocking Tunisia but felt oddly absent\nduring the panel chats. Which leaves\njust Ms. Lauren Laverne who is wholly\nmiscast and I fear will come out the other end of this looking like an idiot.\nFinally if you are going to conduct a\npolitical talk show, some prior knowledge is a must. Not knowing who the\ncabinet ministers are is embarrassing. I\nenjoyed the smirking Richard Sharp of\nGoldman Sachs who smugly listened\nto Mitchell fumble through the banking\ncrisis and this I fear seems to be the major failing of this confuzzled little show.\nComedians are not stupid people but to\nkeep up beyond witty one liners when\ndebating with leaders in their respective fields, some homework is required\nwhich I think the cast are skiving off\nso far. The second half of the show did\npick up with Jimmy looking far more\ncomfortable and so I have great hope\nwith a little restructuring and a deep\nbreath every so often this show can develop on the potential it has to be great\nsatirical comedy that is informative and\ntopical. Especially if they stop airing it\nagainst Question Time and News Night.\nC4 Thursday, 10pm and 4OD\ncatch the whole series, maybe the odd episode here\nand there.\nSimilarly, Hustle is one of those programmes that\nI always intend to watch, but there\u2019s always something better to do. Having to write something about it\nmeant I probably should make an effort to the tune\nof one or two episodes \u2013 I have to say I was a little disappointed. Entertaining though it was, it was\nreminiscent of a low-budget version of \u2018Spooks\u2019 that\nstretched credibility like Anne Widdecombe stretches underwear (...and skin). That being said; it was\nvery watchable and did make me spend around 40\nminutes brushing my teeth because I didn\u2019t want to\nmiss a second. Thinking back, that must be what the\npause button is for.\nThe redeeming factor is undoubtedly the excellent\ncasting of the main characters, who are so comfortable in their roles that it could almost pass as a\ndocumentary if it weren\u2019t for the over-the-top areseh-oleishness of the usual \u2018baddies\u2019. This, considering\nthe genre, is no mean feat, but I still think it\u2019d be\nbrilliant if one of them shouted BANTER when the\nmark realises they\u2019ve been conned.

Any player is eligible to play\nin the Open division, although the highest levels\nare dominated by men. The Mixed division requires a combination, usually split three to four,\nof both men and women where the two genders\ncompete as equals, an unusual scenario in team\nsports. Finally the Women\u2019s division, although the\nsmallest, is becoming increasingly competitive not\nonly at national and international level but also in\nuniversity sport. Three of Imperial\u2019s female players\ngive their insight into what makes women\u2019s Ultimate unique.\nMeg Claverley, captain of the Imperial women\u2019s\nteam, explained that while female players are capable of the skills of their male counterparts, victory\nis determined more often by ingenuity rather than\nby physicality. \u201cIt\u2019s about the communication and\nhow each player plays off of the rest of the team. In\nWomen\u2019s, the game is more often won because you\nfigured out the other team\u2019s tactics and shut them\ndown rather than having faster players and longer\nthrows.\u201d She also highlights the team spirit within\nthe female branch of dD, affectionately known as\nDouble-D. \u201cWomen\u2019s Ultimate at Imperial is a relatively small group of people, which makes us really close and also gives you a lot of opportunities\non the team. It\u2019s given me a better understanding of\nthe game than I would have had otherwise and also\nmeant that I play a lot!\u201d\n\u00c1ine N\u00ed Bhreasail, a PhD student at Imperial,\nlikes to play across all three Ultimate divisions.\n\u201cOpen is interesting as a woman because you often have to mark or be marked by a guy. In some\ncases you will be as fast as him, but in other cases\nyou aren\u2019t and have to use tactics and skill to beat\nthem rather than brute strength.\u201d As well as for\nImperial, she plays for one of the best club teams\nImperials\nultimate\nfrisbee full of\nDouble D\u2019s\nAre foreignmanagers\nvictimised?\nPage 43\nThis week saw the hockey mens 1st XI in action\ntwice, both in cup matches. As holders of the ULU\nchallenge cup, IC were hoping to retain the trophy\nthis season, but received a tough draw against this\nseasons form side, UCL, in the quarter finals. Imperial showed plenty of ability, but some defensive\nmistakes and some missed chances saw us crash out\nof the ULU cup, eventually losing 6 \u2013 4 in a fast,\nopen game, where attack was the only form of defence for both sides.\nIC took heart from their Sunday game, but started\npoorly against GKT, and were 1 \u2013 0 down at half\ntime, causing legendary first team coach Avtar to\nswear for the first time in living memory. After\nsome relentless metaphors, IC improved after the\nbreak, and showed real character and patience,\neventually breaking the deadlock midway through\nthe second half with some inspired play by creative\nplaymaker Tom Koch. At 1-1, all was to play for,\nand the game opened up, leading to goals on both\nsides, with fresher sam scoring his first goal at Imperial, and captain Yogi finding the net despite having his dislocated finger reset twice this week.\nWith 5 minutes to go, IC went 3-2 in front, and\nlooked to have sealed a victory, when a last minute\nbreakaway gave GKT a controversial penalty corner seconds before the final whistle. With all their\nmen up, GKT managed to convert the corner courtesy of a baseball style shot as the ball rebounded.\nThree all at full time meant extra time was to fol-low.\nVowing to continue in the same vein, IC went\ninto extra time confident that they could find a goal,\nbut after being reduced to 10, and then 9 players\ncourtesy of some debateable yellow cards, the first\nhalf of extra time was goalless. When IC returned\nto full strength, they were dominant, and creative\nplaymaker Tom Koch once again found some mag-ic, sealing the victory with an outstanding golden\ngoal, with 2 minutes of extra time remaining.\nIC go into this weekend\u2019s BUCS league match\nwith Holloway full of confidence that they can turn\naround a disappointing start to the season on the\nback of the fantastic BUCS cup win.\nEd Lacey\nM en\u2019s Hockey\nULU Cup Quarter Final\nImperial 1st 4 - 6 UCL 1st\nBUCS Cup Third Round\nImperial 1st 4 - 3 GKT 1st\nHockey\n1st out of\nULU cup\nbut still\nin BUCS\nBig crowd, eh?

    "content": "FASHION\nFa sh ion Editor: Saskia Verhagen\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFELIX Friday 28 January 2011 35\nBoutique du jour: One, Two, Three...\nA new concept store in Shoreditch is causing a sensation: 123 offers patrons the very\nbest of British \u2013 that means locally-sourced fashion, accessories, homeware and cake!\nT\nucked away in Shoreditch, lives\none of London\u2019s most exciting concept stores. 123. Offering beautifully crafted, locally\nsourced British clothing and\naccessories, as well as homeware and other\ntrinkets, the main ethos of 123 is anti-mass\nproduction: British and vintage sourcing and\nrecycling. Micaela Phillipo, representative for\n123, tells us more:\nWhat was the philosophy behind 123?\nOur philosophy is simple. We want to create\n100% sustainable clothing that is fashionable,\nstylish and hand- made. We want to keep the\nwhole manufacturing process local and so,\ndo not outsource any labour nor materials. In\nstore we will be stocking a range of products,\nhome-wares and art that have all been made\nby locally based brands and artists. We want\n123 to be a store where you can rest assured,\nknowing that everything stocked has been\nmanufactured in, if not London, certainly the\nUK.\nWhat has the reaction been to it?\nThe reaction has been overwhelming. In the\nweeks after opening, we were featured on\nDazed Digital, iD online and Vogue. More\nrecently we were voted Time Out\u2019s best new\nshop 2011! It seems that people are really\npositive about making changes in the fashion\nindustry and exposing the lack of necessity for\nmass production and exploitation of cheap labour found outside of the UK.\nWhat are your policies for vetting labels\nyou stock?\nWe initially aspired to be a concept store,\nstocking entirely eco brands, products made in\na sustainable and ecologically sensitive man-ner. However, as the store evolved, and we\nbegan carefully curating a stock of products\nfrom art to gifts, home-wares and jewellery,\nwe wanted to emphasise the subtext of the 123\nphilosophy; \u2018Made in London\u2019. We feel that\nas much as the use of sustainable material in\nmanufacturing is important, so is keeping the\nwhole process local. All labels stocked at 123\nwill be London based and made within the\nUK.\nWhich ethical brands do you stock and\nwhy?\nAt the moment, the main brand we stock is\n\u2018NHS\u2019. The designer, Dr. Noki, is famed for\ncreating one-off couture garments through a\nprocess of deconstruction and rearticulation.\nAt 123, we exclusively stock his diffusion\nline, which takes your conventional T shirt,\ncollared shirt or sweater, and carefully takes it\napart, piecing it back together with embellishments and screen prints.\nAll of the fabrics used by Dr Noki are\nsourced from our own warehouse of recycled\nfabrics and manufacturing occurs around the\nLeather swing skirt, \u00a3120\nThe Grade II Listed building used to be an old cockney gangster hangout, apparently\ncorner from the 123 store.\nWe also stock the D.R. Harris \u2018Naturals\u2019\nrange, beauty products constituted entirely of\nnatural ingredients and made in England. Also,\nJonathan Ward artisan candles, made in London, 100% organic and contained in a recyclable glass, and Miller Harris perfumes, all made\nin London with natural ingredients.\nWhat sort of wholesale price points are you\nlooking for from brands you stock?\nWe have learned, through our 123 range, that\nhand-made, high quality garments end up with\na higher than average production cost. We try\nto keep our price points affordable as we do\nnot believe in alienating our customer, denying them the opportunity to own a sustainable garment. We look to sell brands with an\nopening retail price point of \u00a350 and closing\nat \u00a3400.\nWho is your target audience?\nAt the moment, the 123 label is exclusively\nwomenswear, however, we stock premium\nvintage for Men and the Noki label also caters for your more creatively attired man. We\nare opening the scope for products we stock\nso the store can be a destination for tourists\nlooking to buy something especially made in\nLondon or your average person looking for an\naffordable but luxury gift. We are also targeting fashion conscious individuals who want\nto wear something different, a timeless item\nwhich wouldn\u2019t be disposed of at the end of\nthe season. Our audience is diverse but we are\nmostly targeting the intelligent consumer.\nDo you feel like your location is key to your\nidentity?\nOur location is intrinsic to our brand identity.\nThe parent company of 123, LMB, has its\nroots in East London where the textile recycling factory used to be. The Grade II listed\nbuilding we occupy on Bethnal Green Road\nhas it\u2019s own history which gives it landmark\nstatus in the area. It was once a front for an\nillegal gun trading racket and after the owners were sentenced to jail, the building fell\ninto disrepair. When we bought the building,\nit needed complete renovation, and this way\nwe have effectively recycled the space which\nwould have otherwise been demolished.\nDo you have any further plans to expand?\nYes, at the moment we are working on our tea\nroom which is in the basement of our store.\nWe will be serving tea and coffee and locally\nbaked cakes and breads, freshly made sandwiches and selling food and drink products\nsourced from around London. We will be using this space to stock a selection of books,\ntea sets, antique furniture and 123 label home-wares.\nAlso, we are currently building the \u2018scout\nhut\u2019, which is the large warehouse space behind our shop. We want to help local designers\nby providing an outlet to retail their products.\n123, 123 Bethnal Green Road, Shoreditch E2\n7DG. Interview by Saskia Verhagen.\n\u201cPeople are really positive about\nmaking changes in the fashion\nindustry and exposing the lack of\nnecessity for mass production\u201d\n\n"

Although it requires\nwatching the preceding 30+ hours as a\nwarm up, I would call the penultimate\nepisode of series 3 as The one hour of\ntelevision drama that everyone should\nwatch. HBO are slightly overly sex obsessed when it comes to their productions (see: True Blood) but the gratuitous amounts of sex scenes in The Wire\nare needed to help with the characters\ninteractions with each other. However\nit is not as an ensemble piece that The\nWire excels, although it does so any-way; rather it is through the creation of\nstand out, completely three dimensional\ncharacters who feel for all intents and\npurposes people you actually know in\nreal life. Bubbles, McNulty and the terrifying Omar are to name but three, but\nthe whole cast is a collection of perfectly matched acting skill and razor sharp\nscripting. The final series lost its way,\nalthough the bittersweet final montage\nwent most of the way to redeem it for its\nsins; and other than the slightly frustrat-ingly slow pace at the beginning of the\nfirst two series, I have nothing else to\nfault this show on. Hell, even its theme\ntune makes my hair stand on end. Along\nwith The Sopranos, The Wire cements\nHBOs status as the King of incredible\nadult drama. Matt Allinson\nNew HBO channel on Sky\nThe most respected network in the US launches this week in the UK as Sky Atlantic.\nTo celebrate, over the next couple of issues we will take a look at some of HBO\u2019s\ngreats. This week, Matt Allinson and Lucia Podhorska review their favourites\nW\nhen a series is chosen by\nBarack Obama as his favourite TV show, you know it\u2019s\ngoing to be cool. Stand up comedian\nDavid O\u2019Doherty made the joke that\nhe knows people who love The Wire\nso much they can\u2019t even describe it in\nwords. \u201cSo what do you think of The\nWire?\u201d He asks, \u201cblaaeerrrrrghhh!\u201d the\nafflicted Wire fan replies. Unfortunately I frequently fall into this category,\nso writing a coherent review is proving\nquite difficult for me. The story follows\na team of Baltimore police officers,\nover the course of 5 years, who specialise in surveillance operations on organised criminal groups. As can be expected with an HBO series, the baddies\nand goodies are very indistinct from\neach other: you know their life stories\nand their complex backgrounds and the\nshow itself doesn\u2019t force a judgement\non anyone. So much time and effort is\nIt is not as an\nensemble piece that\nThe Wire excels...\nrather it is through\nthe creation of\ncompletely three\ndimensional\ncharacters\n\u201c\nshow itself doesn\u2019\nshow itself doesn\non anyone. So mu\non anyone.

Acting talent is so abundant in this show\nthat it makes most other programs, and\neven many films, look weak and feeble\nby comparison. Each individual series\nstand proud as a brilliant self contained\nachievement of script writing and vi-sion, starting with a simple premise for\na case to be built and following through\nthe police and criminals running along\nB\nased on the popular Southern\nVampire Mysteries series of\nnovels by author Charlaine Harris, True Blood was first introduced to\nviewers in 2008 by Alan Ball, creator\nof Six Feet Under and Academy Award\nwinning writer of American Beauty,\nwrites Lucia Podhorska.\nIn a world where vampires have come\nout of the coffin and are living openly\nalongside humans, the main character\nSookie Stackhouse is a waitress at Merlotte\u2019s in the small town of Bon Temps,\nLouisiana. Played by Anna Paquin\n(Academy Award winning actress from\nThe Piano), Sookie is 25 years old and a\ntelepath \u2013 she can hear what other people around her are thinking. This might\nseem like a gift, but when you have a\nboss \u2013 Sam \u2013 who is in love with you\nand a brother \u2013 Jason \u2013 who won\u2019t stop\nthinking about sex, it\u2019s more of a curse.\nBut all this changes when Merlotte\u2019s\ngets its first vampire customer in the\nform of Bill Compton. Bill is tall, dark\nand handsome and Sookie can\u2019t hear his\nthoughts. Naturally, the two are drawn\nto each other and a romance blossoms.\nHowever, all is not well as their small\ntown appears to have a serial killer on\nthe loose, targeting women who associate with vampires. Throw in some\nshapeshifters, werewolves and gorgeous vampire sheriff Eric Northman\nand Sookie\u2019s life will never be the same\nagain\u2026\nOn the surface this may sound like just\nanother Twilight or Vampire Diaries,\nbut thankfully none of the characters\nare in high school anymore. While there\nis plenty of romantic drama, True Blood\nwould not be an HBO show without\nblood, gore and sex galore. By making\nvampires a part of society and lobbying\nbecause it always keeps me guessing. I\nlove finding out what has happened in\nthe past to make the characters the way\nthey are and with some vampires over\n2000 years old, you can count on some\ninteresting history. All of the characters\nare engaging and the casting has been\nwonderful throughout, notably Nelsan\nEllis as Lafayette, who takes the theory\nof \u2018if you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it\u2019 to a whole\nother level. Evan Rachel Woods, probably best known for her movie Thirteen,\nis also a joy to watch as the Queen and\nI\u2019m interested to see what happens with\nher character in season 4.\nI find the show, which has received\nnumerous awards including an Emmy\nand Golden Globe, to be completely ad-dictive, causing me to watch all three\nseasons in three days and making me\norder the books as well. I am now half\nway through re-watching season one after only one week and am still hooked.\nAnd if that\u2019s not the best compliment, I\ndon\u2019t know what is\u2026\nWhistling is now cool again\nThe Wire\nThis may sound\nlike just another\nTwilight... but\nthankfully none of\nthe characters are in\nhigh school anymore\n\u201c\nuty,\nme\nme\nnly\nnly\nter\nter\ner-er-ps\nblood, gore and se\nblood, gore and se\nvampires a part of\nvampires a part o\nThis may s\nThis may s\nlike just an\nlike just a\n\u201d\nwa\nwa\nter\nter\nAn\nAn\ndon\ndo\nters are in\nters are in\nl anymore\nanymore\nfor equal rights, the books and show are\nalso able to cleverly use these creatures\nas a metaphor for other demographics\nthat have been discriminated against.\nBut what is also wonderfully refresh-ing, is that the vampires are all three-di-mensional characters and are not easily\nplaced in the good or evil category.

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX\nFRIDAY 28 january 2011\n32\nFood Editor: Dana Li\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe hazards of eating out\nGastronomical News\nDana says:\n\u201cThe 2011 Michelin Guide landed last week (19th\nJan), celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.\nKitchen W8, off High Street Kensington, and Gordon\nRamsey\u2019s P\u00e9trus in Belgravia were newly awarded\na star. A Soho favourite, Polpo, which serves Italian tapas in a Venetian-like backdrop, received a bib\ngourmand, an accolade that recognizes good food at\nmoderate prices.\nReceiving a Michelin star is what certain chefs aspire to, counting their stars almost like how we count\nour PhDs; one if we\u2019re extremely lucky but most of\nus - none at all. But for many diners looking for a\ngood meal, the Michelin guide means little or noth-ing. If anything, the guide allows chefs the right to\narrogance whilst the restaurants jack up the prices.\nThe reality is that today\u2019s diner does not require an\nannual guide to direct them to a good meal. Polpo,\nand its sister restaurant Polpetto, have enjoyed success even before Michelin cottoned on. Refusing to\ntake dinner reservations, the success largely relied\non word of mouth from friends, family and the online\nfood blogging community.\nOnce considered a \u2018food bible\u2019 (albeit this was\nself-described), the Michelin man and his guide just\ndoesn\u2019t seem so vital anymore.\u201d\nThe SCR food, with its leather-tough beef, dry\nchicken, and liquefied peas \u2013 is there anything\nmore depressing? Well, yes \u2013 genocide, estate\nagents, malaria, sexual rape, facebook rape,\nyawn rape, and Robert Peston. The SCR is,\nafter all, just a university canteen in a country\nmocked globally for its poor gastronomy \u2013\nGreat British Menu being as much of an oxymoron as Corporate Culture. An overhaul of\nthe lugubrious menu would nonetheless not go\namiss \u2013 I did contact Jamie Oliver, but he was\nelsewhere engaged. At a minimum, I trust Felix will not have to apologise again for daring\nto point out that the SCR food lacks a certain\nfinesse (they have yet to find that delicate balance between burnt or soggy food).\nBut whilst the SCR is at a push tolerable, is it\nfair to also let the best restaurants in our capital city get away with murder? The top London eateries seem to be becoming increasingly\nunpleasant and inconsiderate, in the same way\nthat having pliers gripped to one\u2019s testicles isn\u2019t\nvery nice.\nIf I want to go out for an enjoyable meal with\nfriends, and take the precaution of booking a\nfew days in advance, I do not want to be told\nthat I can have a table for four at 8pm but that I\nhave to be done eating by 10pm for the next sitting of diners. Where\u2019s the sense of occasion?\nI hate deadlines when they\u2019re for coursework,\nlet alone recreational purposes. The thing is\nthat once you have to time a meal, it no longer\nfeels like a treat \u2013 just an inconvenience to the\nrestaurant.\nWhat is most depressing about these fixed\nseating times is that you come to the realization\nthat your life is pretty insignificant. The restaurant is effectively telling you they don\u2019t give a\ndamn, but they would quite like your cash and\nif you could leave promptly that would be very\njolly indeed.\nBut not only can I not choose how long I\nstay; I also have to be forcefully generous for\nthe privilege by coughing up a minimal 12.5%\n\u201cdiscretionary\u201d surcharge. It is discretionary\nif the service charge is not mentioned on the\nmenu but appears on the bill \u2013 sounds like a bit\nof ruse to me. I have to bear with phone com-panies, the council, and British Gas ripping me\noff, but I didn\u2019t expect this sort of behaviour\nfrom a restaurant. Soon I\u2019ll be feeling quite\nunhappy as they gorge my eyes out for loose\nchange, and I\u2019ll be wishing I had gone to McDonalds.\nWhen I look at the prices on a menu, I feel\nthey should tell me how much I will be paying\nat the end of the meal. By financially tapping\nthemselves on the back in this way, the restaurant is effectively removing the need for good\nservice to obtain a decent tip. They could choke\na chicken over my plate, and I bet the 12.5%\nwould still be there cum the bill. Even the\nSCR hasn\u2019t gone that far (although that tartare\nsauce\u2026). And they love that little trick of hav-Discretionary? It doesn\u2019t look particularly discreet to me\nThe art of being screwed over by restaurants today\nJustinPoliachik/flickr\ning an automatic step in the PIN machine that\nasks the patron for a tip amount to be added,\nabove the 12.5%. The sheer nerve of it all \u2013 do\nI get a discretionary happy ending if I tip more?\nNo \u2013 I just get shafted.\nAnd when looking at the bill, one item always stands out. A litre of water costs about\n\u00a3100! Something that falls from the sky with\nsome regularity in London, and is cursed at by\nmost commuters most of the time \u2013 yet in a res-taurant, we\u2019re asked to fork out good dough for\nthis. It\u2019s a goddam scandal. You know you\u2019re\ngetting screwed, and the waiters smile while\nthey screw you and you inexplicably smile\nback.\nBut you know what? I\u2019ll keep getting\nscrewed. I don\u2019t really do prolonged acts of\nprotest, so I will just have to settle with narrowing my eyes, tutting and getting on with my\nlife. See you at Le Caprice sometime soon.\n\u201cSoon I\u2019ll be feeling quite\nunhappy as they gorge\nmy eyes out for loose\nchange, and I\u2019ll be wishing I had gone to\nMcDonalds\u201d\nCharles Betts\nLook for this voucher every week to enjoy kickass\nwaffles at Wafflemeister for the next month and a\nhalf - you know you want to...\n\n"

In contrast to previous EPs, such\nas the infectious CMYK, the record is predominantly\nvocal lead. It is also far more downbeat, and chilled\nout \u2013 more suited to bedrooms than dancefloors.\nThe first single from the album, a rendition of Feist\u2019s\n\u2018Limit To Your Love\u2019, is arguably the worst track on the\nalbum, unable to capture the elegance of the original\nand the sparse arrangement in this version feels rather flat and dull. The rest of the album however is significantly better, despite the surprising shift in focus\nfrom his previous work (it\u2019s fair to say this reviewer\ncan hear more Anthony Hegarty and Bon Iver than say\nMount Kimbie or Burial here) this is still a good solid\nalbum that is easy to enjoy.

The music suits the image of a surfing skeleton. It\u2019s classic rock with fuzz, 60\u2019s garage without a leash, a\nblend of the dark side to all things good, with that\nburlesque charm, a surfing nightmare. And for that\nreason, we love it.

LCD Soundsystem\nFriday 28 January 2011\nT\nhe underground dance music scene\nin the UK is the healthiest it has\nbeen for a number of years. London is, as ever, a melting pot for\nmusicians from a myriad of backgrounds who push the boundaries of what becomes many peoples\u2019 4am soundtrack. It is in\ntestament to this that I devote a second label review to a London-based label: Ramp Recordings. Set up in 2004 by Tom Kerridge in order\nto give his life a direction, Ramp Recordings\nhas released music from the likes of Flying Lotus, Zomby and Maxmillion Dunbar.\nKerridge professes to simply release music\nthat interests him and over the past few years it\nseems that the world has aligned with his ideas\nas opposed to him changing his ethos in order\nto cash in on the flavour of the month. From\nAmerican instrumental hip-hop to UK Funky\nand then Zomby, Ramp Recordings essentially sums up the current mood in UK dance\nmusic today. In 2007 the label helped bring\nZomby\u2019s lucid synth dreamscapes to the attention of the world, quickly turning him into\nextremely hot property. Even Lady Gaga used\nsome of his music in one of the transitions on\nher recent \u2018Monster Ball\u2019 tour.\nAlthough Ramp dictates a lot of what is going on in the UK music scene right now, a lot of\nthe output has origins from across the Atlantic.\nP.U.D.G.E, Maxmillion Dunbar and FaltyDL\nall originate from across the pond and have contributed to some of the best releases on the label\nto date. P.U.D.G.E makes distracted instrumental hip-hop; his recent album \u2018Idiot Box\u2019weaves\nerratic beats with smooth synth lines over a\nstrange vocal sample that continues throughout\nthe whole record creating the effect of a radio\nthat can\u2019t settle on a single station. In contrast,\nMaxmillion Dunbar\u2019s most recent effort \u2018Cool\nWater\u2019 mixes smooth electronica with hip-hop\nTECHNO\nNONSENSE\nPt. 4: This week Simon\nHunter reports on the\ntrailblazing label that\nis platforming some of\nLondon\u2019s most exciting\nunderground music\nbeats and tinges of disco. FaltyDL treads a\nmore familiar path with his most recent EP \u2018Hip\nLove\u2019, displaying elements of UK Funky and\nGarage through a beat that whilst continually\ntripping over itself, refuses to go down.\nRamp Recordings is an excellent showcase\nof where the UK scene is at at the moment,\nand to get a taste of it try these favourites. Doc\nDaneeka\u2019s \u2018Hold On\u2019 warms up UK Funky\nwith soul samples and a faint vinyl crackle, and\nJamieXX\u2019s remix of \u2018Hip Love\u2019 by FaultyDL\ndoes away with the complicated drum rhythms\nof the original and replaces them with a bouncy\nbass line.\nSimon Hunter will be playing a DJ set at\n19.02.\nTechno-bot wants to BLOW YOUR MIND!\nL\nast Friday saw the promotors Kill\nem All hijack the club\u2019s hallowed\nhalls and the music policy was\nstrictly four to floor, ranging the\nwhole spectrum from disco and\nelectro to pounding techno. Filthy Dukes set\nthe tone of the night, a rendition of Green Velvet\u2019s classic \u2018It\u2019s Time for the Percolator\u2019 indicated that it was going to be a long one indeed.\nAt midnight, the electro-rock outfit Django\nDjango took to the stage in room 1. Their soaring guitars accompanied with glitchy synths\nand resonating bass sounded perfect as the club\nbegan to fill up.\nBy the time Erol Alkan was handed control\nof the decks the room had swelled to an eager\nmass of convulsing and grinding bodies. After\na month touring the festivals in Australia the\nLondon legend looked perfectly at home mixing classics with contemporary tunes. It had\nbeen a while since I had seen Erol do a full\nclub set and I was not disappointed; nineties\nrave was harmoniously mashed with New Order and Caribou, the rises and drops perfectly\nanticipated and the denouement being a re-edited version of his Boys Noize collaboration\n\u2018Avalanche\u2019.\nDutchman Paul Chambers presented the\nnovel idea of a live set incorporating synthesizers and drum machines however the succession\nof discordant synth waves followed by drum\nrolls and bass soon became repetitive.\nFortunately, over in room 2, rising stars\nHey Today! kept the crowd moving and the\nenergy levels soaring, not a single soul in the\nclub could prevent their bodies from dancing\nas bass heavy fidget house and furious electo\ninstructed their legs to move. This resurgence\nof rave-inspired dance music is becoming huge\nin Europe and the German duo gave us a taste\nof what we might be missing. While tired faces\nbecame more common and the dancefloor emp-tied, Londoner Stopmakingme kept the stragglers entertained with a well crafted techno set\nuntil the early morning.\nFabric is still not showing its age. The sound\nis meticulously controlled, with crystal clear\ntreble and deep bellowing bass, never once\nhurting your ears.

The blast on Monday was blamed on\nChechen rebels and killed 35 people and injured hundreds leading to a shakeup of the Russian Transport\nMinistry. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Prime Minister vowed\nretribution for the bombing and promised to bring\nthose responsible to trial. Russia is currently facing\na decades old\ninsurgency in\nthe North Caucasus amidst\nwidespread\npoverty and\ncorruption in\nthat region.\nPalestine\nPresident Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has pledged\nto support South Sudan in his first address since\nthe referendum held two weeks ago. Preliminary\nresults showed that 99 % of the south voted for\nindependence. President al-Bashir has pledged to\nhonour their decision and celebrate together with\nthe South. The economies of an independent South\nSudan and Sudan would still be heavily intertwined\neven after independence. The South produces 75%\nof Sudan\u2019s oil output but most of the export infrastructure remains in the North. North and South\nSudan will have to agree on how to split oil income,\nshare the national debt and citizenship amongst\nother things before the South officially declares independence on the 9th of July.\nRussia\nPalestinian officials are looking for the source\nof leaked confidential papers about the Middle\nEastern peace process which were leaked to Arabic news channel Al-Jazeera. Al-Jazeera was given\n1600 pieces of secret documents from the talks\nwhich are slowly being made public. Information\nfrom these papers suggests that the Palestinian\nAuthority may be preparing to compromise on key\nissues including the right of return for Palestinian\nrefugees and the status of Jerusalem. These papers\nwere met with criticism by the Palestinian refugees,\nmany of whom demand the right of return and a say\nin the final outcome of the peace process.\nTunisia\u2019s revolution:\nthe first of many?\nFriday 28 January 2011\nMajid Al-Khalil\nOn the 17th December 2010 Mohamed\nBouazizi went to the office of his regional\ngovernor, drenched himself in petrol and set\nhimself alight. He succumbed to his horrific injuries and died some days later. As a twenty six\nyear old high school graduate he was relatively\nwell educated yet despaired at the lack of opportunities for more-than-menial work. Local\ngovernment officials made his life a misery,\nrepeatedly harassing him and subjecting him to\npublic humiliations. A street vendor for many\nyears, the final straw came when they began\nconfiscating his wares after demanding a license which they knew not to exist. Described\nby his family as a quiet and softly spoken man,\nhis death was the result of a psychological\nbreakdown brought on by years of submis-sively accepting injustice at the hands of a governmental system so corrupt and extensive that\nit interfered with the daily lives of many of its\ncitizens who, beleaguered by poverty, were just\ntrying to make ends meet.\nHis seething anger at his situation was shared\nby many others and manifested itself in a\nmonth of rioting and violence which has erupted across Tunisia. The wrath of so many common people has brought the autocratic government to its knees and sent \u201cPresident\u201d Ben Ali\nfleeing for his life; only the second man to rule\nthe country since 1956.\nThe question on the minds of many, no doubt\nincluding the other puppet presidents, kings\nand emirs who rule the Arab world is whether\nor not this unrest will spread. Mass protest is\nuncommon in the Middle East and is in general\nillegal or restricted. State run security agencies\nmercilessly punish those involved and repression is swift and brutal. For many Arabs, especially those living with some financial security\nin less harsh regimes, the stakes in the struggle\nfor democracy are far too high. However, as\nthe economic crisis bites, millions of Arabs are\nstruggling with soaring food and fuel prices\nthat make our VAT increase seem rather pal-try. As mentioned in Time earlier this week,\neconomic despair strips citizens of their fear.\nAn example many will be watching is that\nof Jordan. One of the safer and more stable\nArab countries, it has been relatively free of\nunrest in recent decades. But with unemployment reaching a staggering 30% (double the\nofficial figure) it is more difficult than ever to\npredict what lies in store and thousands have\nbeen protesting at the rising food prices and\nunemployment.\nAll this presents an unsavoury dilemma for\npolicy makers in the rest of the world. It is not\njust a question of the oil reserves which we are\nall so evidently dependent on. The simple fact\nis that although many of our western leaders\ncall for democratic reform in the Middle East,\nthese are generally hollow cries. The results of\ntrue democracy could be tough to swallow. A\ndespotic king who can be persuaded to share\nhis oil in exchange for financial gains is often\na safer bet than a radical Islamist regime which\nwould benefit no one. The result is that countries such as Dubai form the acceptable face of\nArab autocracy. The way in which their lav-ish, opulent and stupid construction projects\nand their endless shopping malls, greed and\ngluttony are rebranded as some sort of new\nArab sophistication is a remarkable feat of\nmarketing and spin. Less often do we hear of\nthe living conditions of the South Asians who\nconstruct these palaces of shit, or the massive\nabuses of power within.\nIn truth, these recent events are unlikely to\nherald a 1989 moment for the Arab world, the\nvested interests are too deep and the economic\nfactors which are inflaming the situation will\nnot last forever. But no system is perfect, and it\nmay be the case that a few Arab leaders will be\na little less relaxed as they continue to sip from\ntheir poisoned chalices.\nWednesday 25th saw Obama give his second\nState of the Union address \u2013 his first since his\nparty\u2019s \u2018shellacking\u2019 at the hands of the Republicans in November\u2019s mid term elections. The\nspeech was short on policy but included concessions to the Republicans. His speech included:\n\u2013 The rocketing advance of China and India, and the need to confront this as the US did\nwhen faced with the technological advance of\nthe USSR \u2013 the need to find this generation\u2019s\n\u201csputnik moment\u201d.\n\u2013 The promise of increased spending in scientific research; especially in clean energy.\n\u2013 A 5 year spending freeze to save $400\nbillion.\n\u2013 Lower corporate tax and simpler regulations.\n\u2013 Tougher sanctions on Iran and reiterated\nsupport for South Korea.\n\u2013 Support for the ousting of Tunisia\u2019s president\nand \u2018the democratic aspirations of all people\u2019.\nObama\u2019s State of the Union address\n\n"

Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nArmor Mayhem\narmorgames.com/play/10215\nIn this 2D futuristic shoot-\u2019em-up, you play an armoured soldier fighting for a trans-planetary corporation on a planet consumed by humanity\u2019s energy\ncrisis. It\u2019s a fight to the death for control of mysterious crystals (which don\u2019t feature in the gameplay)\nand you and your AI team-mates must compete in\ndeathmatch, capture-the-flag and king-of-the-hill style\ngames against other corporations.\nThe game delivers very solid action that does its\nforefathers Quake and Unreal Tournament proud.\nThe AI is actually very competent and do a good job\nof keep the game challenging. Although the selection of weapons is small, they\u2019re well balanced and\ncomplement each other in damage and accuracy.\nThere\u2019s also a admirable variety of maps who\u2019s stylish visuals round off the game into a great little\nexperience.\n30\nIs it as delicious as they say?\n(or maybe that\u2019s just me). This only heightens\nthe feeling of success when you finally manage\nto navigate Meat Boy across the beautiful but\nincredibly deadly 2D environment to reach his\nlove, Bandage Girl. Honestly, it\u2019s rare to find\na game that leaves you feeling like such a true\nplatforming pro.\nThis challenge, along with the nostalgia-in-ducing 16-bit console feel and suburban musical score puts SMB a cut above the rest. The\n\u2018light world\u2019 alone will keep you occupied for\nages \u2013 don\u2019t even get me started on the \u2018dark\u2019,\nmuch harder world. The hype SMB generated\nT\nhree things are required to complete a game like Super Meat Boy\nsuccessfully: The first is a sturdy\nkeyboard or controller, the second\nis a level of patience few devout\nZen Buddhists can ever hope to attain and the\nthird is more free time than your average Arts or\nMedia Studies student. Whilst I\u2019m rich enough\nto afford the first and lazy enough to possess the\nthird, I sadly fall short on requirement two, and\nboy does it show when I play.\nBefore I delve deeper, a short history lesson\nfor the unfamiliar. SMB originated as a Flash\ngame on popular portal Newgrounds.com sometime in 2008 and was such an orgasmic success\nthat it was developed by the aptly named Team\nMeat into a fully-fledged game, released on\nXbox Live Arcade and Windows near the end of\n2010; there\u2019s a Mac version coming soon, sup-posedly. Anyone who follows reviews will know\nthat the game did bloody ruddy well, generating\na truckload of hype and literally making reviewers cream their pants (ok not \u2018literally\u2019). But\nwhy? Well I don\u2019t know. Go research it yourself\nyou lazy bums.\nOk, ok, that\u2019s not very professional of me.\nLet\u2019s try again... Before I attempt to answer that\nquestion for you eager little beavers, let me tell\nyou why this game is amazingly fun whilst simultaneously being amazingly rage-inducing.\nIt\u2019s hard. Let\u2019s not sugar-coat this, it\u2019s balls to the\nwall hard. Team Meat realised that some gamers\nwant a challenge, and so those bastards gave us\none. Saws will rip you apart, lava pits will melt\nyou and you\u2019ll fall to your meaty death more\ntimes than you can say buggering cow nipples\nremote isn\u2019t exactly touted for its accuracy and\nSMB requires accuracy in the same way that I\nrequired sanity and counselling after my first\nhour of play.\nSneak peeks of the game during development\ntouted the game\u2019s retro feel and NES-style\ngraphics, to the delight of many eager players.\nI was amongst them, although I\u2019ll admit it now\nI wasn\u2019t quite swept up by the hype this game\nconjured up. Then again, I try to avoid getting\nsucked into to any of that stuff, since in many\ncases the overly-hyped game flops like a moist\nfish and you\u2019re left feeling rather unsatisfied,\nlike coming home from Imperial and finding\nsome bastard\u2019s drunk the last of the milk.\nSuper Meat Boy didn\u2019t leave me with that\nfeeling. It\u2019s fresh, fiendishly difficult and quite\npossibly the most enjoyable way to give yourself hypertension. And let\u2019s be brutally honest\nhere, who hasn\u2019t dreamed of playing a game\nwhere you command a lump of sentient meat\nto rescue a girl made of bandages from a top\nhat wearing foetus in a robot suit?\n@FelixGames on Twitter\nStop having a boring Twitter, stop having a boring life. You\u2019ll love my tweets!\nThis SHOULD be totally awesome... and yet somehow I just feel a bit grossed out.\nL a urence Pope asks if Super Meat Boy deserves the hype\n\u201cLet\u2019s not sugar-coat\nthis, Super Meat Boy is\nballs to the wall hard.\u201d\nbefore its release is another question entirely.\nThe fact that SMB stemmed from a Flash\ngame certainly helped, it already had a platform from which to launch its meaty self \u2013 to\ndate, the Flash version has recieved over 8 million views, which, I\u2019ll say now, isn\u2019t half bad.\nHype was also generated due to the fact that it\nwas supposed to arrive on the PC, Mac, Xbox\nand the Wii, making it the first Indie game to\nbe released on multiple consoles. Unfortunately, the poor ol\u2019 Wii just couldn\u2019t hack it\nand that incarnation of Super Meat Boy had to\nbe scrapped due to filesize limitations. In all\nfairness, it was probably for the best; the Wii\nNew Age of Empires\nOnline to take series\nin fresh direction\nIt\u2019s been a long time since real-time strategy\nfans have been treated to a new game in the\never-popular Age of Empires series, but in\nearly 2010 it was announced a new title would\nfinally be arriving. New developers Robot Entertainment have revealed details about how\nAge of Empires Online will be departing from\nthe traditions of previous games in the series.\nWhile the classic real-time strategy elements\nwill remain in some form, AOEO brings a new\ntwist to the table with persistent online game-play. Even when players aren\u2019t in the game,\ntheir cities and civilization will continue to\nwork and grow. Friends will be able to \u2018visit\u2019\nand purchase items in a similar style to social\ngames like FarmVille.\nThe title will be free to play with no one-off\nprice or monthly subscription, instead employing a premium service that will give players\naccess to exclusive items and allow them to\ngather more resources. Despite this, Robot Entertainment have given their assurance that the\ngame will remain balanced.\nMeat Boy\nnewgrounds.com/portal/view/463241\nJust read that article to the right and fancy getting\nyourself a slice of that bloody red action? Why not try\nthe original Flash game that started the craze? It\u2019s\nnot as well-polished as it\u2019s big brother but still packs\nall the crazy-hard levels that you could ever need.\n\n"

    "content": "Increasing obstacles for\nprospective students\nNEWS\nFELIX\n4\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHalls\nStudents Switch Off to Success\nucstult.wordpress.com\nThe Student Switch Off Scheme, a not-for-profit\nproject aimed at reducing the amount of electricity\nused in student halls of residence, achieved great\nsuccess at Imperial last term. Recently released\ndata shows that the 11 participating halls have reduced their energy use in October and November\nby 2% compared to previous years. According to a\npress release by the scheme this is enough to make\n631,716 cups of tea and has reduced carbon emissions by 11 tonnes. The 223 students involved, representing 12% of those living in halls, have already\nsurpassed last year\u2019s efforts, which organisers believe reduced emissions of CO2\nby seven tonnes.\nEastside has made the most progress, saving almost 0.60kWh of energy per student per day, making them the best placed to win the free end of year\nparty which awarded to the hall which has made the\nbiggest reductions.\nThe scheme is part of a national venture involving\n37 universities, which include The London School\nof Economics and the University of Liverpool, and\n14,000 students. Its sponsors include Carbon Leapfrog and the National Union of Students. It was created in 2007 by Dr Neil Jennings at the University of\nEast Anglia, where it managed to reduce energy usage by 10% and has gone from strength to strength\nsince then. Last academic year the project helped to\nsave over \u00a3292,000 and 2,100 tonnes of CO2\n.\nAs well as the end of year party, the Student Switch\nOff Scheme also runs photo competitions with energy saving themes, with winners receiving Ben and\nJerry\u2019s products, LUSH goody bags or tickets to Metric. The title of the latest competition is \u201cWrap up\nWarm\u201d. Last term students were invited to screenings pro-environmental films \u201cThe Yes Men Fix the\nWorld\u201d and \u201cThe Age of Stupid\u201d. The scheme\u2019s website (www.studentswitchoff.org/) also has a \u201chow to\nsave energy\u201d page and students can discuss their\ngreen ideas on the individual university facebook\npages.\nThis year\u2019s scheme looks set to be a huge success.\nDr Jennings says that he believes that it is \u201cmaking significant environmental and financial savings\nacross the UK\u201d and that the students involved are\n\u201cplaying a part in the fight against climate change\u201d.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nRecent figures published by UCAS in their Final End of Year Figures for 2010 has shown\na decrease of 0.1% in accepted applicants in\nthe UK compared to 2009, but this doesn\u2019t really come as a surprise after all the over-hyped\nnews of university cuts and how 200,000 students had missed out on places last year.\nUCAS statistics indicate that even though\nthere is a 0.7% increase for undergraduates,\nthere is a significant percentage drop for postgraduate applicants resulting in an overall\ndecrease of applicants getting their places for\nuniversities.\nEveryone knows how difficult getting a place\nat university has become in recent years. Not\nonly are there spending cuts, A* grade-offers\nand higher tuition fees, but the number of applicants applying this year compared to last year\nhas risen by 2.5%. So with more applicants and\nless places, the university admissions process\nwill be setting their standards pretty high.\nThe Sutton Trust has conducted an investigation on the differences in background between\nstudents who are getting places at universities.\nThey compared and reviewed the number of\nstudents coming from Independent schools\nand students from schools that provided them\nwith \u2018Free School Meals\u2019 over the last three\nyears.\nThe findings from the Sutton Report showed\nthat Independent school pupils are 6 times as\nlikely to attend a highly selective university as\nthe majority of children in state schools. Basically, students from private schools have a better chance of getting into the universities such\nas Oxford and Cambridge.\nAemun Reza\nImperial College statistics showed that we\nwere no different from Oxbridge with a massive 37.2% of students coming from Independent schools and only 2.9% of students that had\n\u2018Free School Meals\u2019.\nTo combat this unfair gap between the princes and paupers of university applicants, the\nSutton Trust suggested that universities should\nagree to targets that cover new measures for ensuring fair access into their universities (where\nthese new measures were not given).\nAdditionally, the tuition fee rise means that\nstudents from poorer backgrounds are reconsidering whether they can afford to attend uni-versity, regardless of getting a place or not and\npossibly despite the changes The Sutton Trust\nare proposing.\nAnd to top it all off, university admissions\nwill have an even stricter entry process than\nbefore as many universities have increased\ntheir offers to include the new A*s (with some\ncourses at Cambridge going as far as 3 A*s).\nTo conclude, even though UCAS statistics\ndon\u2019t show a significant difference between the\nnumber of accepted applicants between 2009\nand 2010, it is likely that ever larger numbers\nof prospective students will fail to gain a place\nat university as failed applicants from previous\nyears compete with new students for the same\nuniversity spots.\nJewish and Muslim student \u2018ambassadors\u2019 to promote interfaith relations\nThe introduction of 18 Muslim and Jewish students acting as \u201ccampus ambassadors\u201d in 10\nuniversities across the UK is hoped to promote\nmore interfaith relationships between the two\ncommunities.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is possibly\nthe most controversial of our time and is often the cause of tension between Muslims and\nJews many hundreds of miles across the world;\nfrequently restricting dialogue between members of the two groups.\nThe 26th January 2011 saw the launch of the\n\u201ccampus ambassador\u2019s programme\u201d. Run by\nthe Coexistence Trust, a London-based charity set up in 2005 as a parliamentary network\nto tackle Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, the\nprogramme aims to build a \u201cnetwork of trust\nand understanding between Muslim and Jewish\nstudents on UK campuses\u201d.\nThe problem, explains Yuval Jacob, Jewish\ncampus ambassador and first year chemical\nengineering student at Imperial, is that the two\ncommunities do not actively mix. Yuval reasons\nthat some Jewish and Muslim students \u201cdo not\nsee the point in developing a friendship\u201d.\nShahnazAhsan, manager of the trust, says that\nshe has found that \u201cthere are pockets of students\nwho want to be working together and are quite\nexcited when they see there is an external organisation supportive of what they are doing\u201d. Ahsan hopes the programme will \u201cset a new tone\nof respectful debate on campus and avoid the\npolarisation we have seen in recent years\u201d.\nYuval believes the campus ambassador programme could have a much greater impact\nthan simply promoting interfaith relationships\non university campuses. He argues that bringing together the \u201cconstant onlooking majority,\nwhich lets these conflicts reign since they are\nsimply unsure, undecided, or too cowardly to\nresist and denounce it\u201d is vital to a final resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIan Wei\nHe\u2019s not just turning off a light, he\u2019s also making a\nbold statement on our reliance on Russian gas...\nA decent \u2018A-Level Results\u2019 photo. Girls? Check. Blonde? Check. Jumping? Ah, sadly no\nFriday 28 january 2011\n\u201cThe programme will \u2018set\na new tone of respectful\ndebate on campus\u2019\u201d\n\n"

As the sun of Rio de Janeiro\nwashed over us, we stumbled out of the\nairport dragging our bags behind us.\nAlmost immediately we were presented with a display of what is termed\n\u2018Latin passion\u2019. A smartly dressed businessman and his wife were arguing in\nthe arrivals terminal. He turned to the\nwoman and gesticulated pulling his hair\nout: rather than responding with fear,\nshe gestured back, shouting and scream-ing. Suddenly, he yanked the kicking\nbaby from her arms and stormed towards the exit. Dramatically, she sunk\nto her knees, and then just as quickly as\nhe had disappeared, he was back, pulling her up, and taking her with him. She\nkissed him on the cheek, and they both\nleft. Nobody else seemed perturbed by\nthe noise and theatrics involved. In fact,\nwe were the only people to stand watch-ing, mouths agape \u2013 welcome to Rio.\nAfter surviving a rather bumpy bus\nride to Cobacopana, dodging small vehicles and jumping red lights as horns\nblared, we walked six blocks up to our\nhostel, dumped our backpacks and began to explore the beach. It was packed\ntions were being held the next day and\npoliticians\u2019 cars sped by with megaphones attached, singing out the voting\nnumbers to catchy drum-beats. \u201cI\u2019d like\nto see David Cameron do that!\u201d a fellow\ngringo joked.\nAs we nervously entered the stadium\nto spectate on the Botefugo supporter\u00b4s\nside, the atmosphere was electric.\nAround us, giant black flags sporting\nplayers\u2019 faces were being frantically\nwaved around. We sat down to await the\nstarting whistle, while our neighbours\nwere standing on their seats, shouting\nwhat we later learnt was \u2018up yours Flamengo\u2019. Locals were handing out balloons and toilet rolls: as the drumming\nhit its crescendo, the rolls were thrown\ndownward to produce a fantastic array\nof falling white streamers. Music and\ncheering surrounded us. Everything was\nextremely animated, so much so that we\nhardly even noticed the match had be-gun.\nAmidst the kettle drums, horns, maracas and singing of the first half, the tourists remained the only people still sat on\ntheir seats, nervously clutching at the\nprogrammes in Portuguese and clapping\nonly every so often when the match in-tensified. An old man amongst the supporters suddenly became enraged. He\nturned to us, gestured towards his heart\nand screamed an endless rant that ended\nfeet when it looked like Botefugo might\nscore?\nBrazilians are very emotive people,\nespecially when sport is involved. If\nyou cry, you should be wracked with\nsadness, with tears streaming down\nyour cheeks and your face buried in\nyour hands. If you are joyous, then you\nshould leap up, hug the nearest person\nand celebrate. The worst thing you can\ndo is sit in your seat and engage in the\ngame by yourself.\nLesson one from Brazil was certainly\nlearnt: live life with \u2018Latin passion\u2019.\nBrazilians are not worried about how\nthey appear to others, and display emotion in every movement that they make.\nTo do otherwise is to not live within the\nmoment. You are not really feeling unless you show it. Life in Rio is a celebra-tion: whether in sadness or in happiness,\nit must be savoured and enjoyed. Humbled, we rose to our feet, and cheered\nwith our hands to the stars.\n\u00b4NE APPASSIONATO!\u00b4 \u2013 he simply\ncould not understand why we had no\npassion!

The sound of samba\nand loud Portuguese conversation fluttered in the breeze.\nThat evening we went to a local football match.

Page 6\nPhD funding\nblunder in Aero\nDepartment failed to tell students\ntheir bursary was being reduced\nEleven PhD students in the Department\nof Aeronautics have been left angered\nand confused after their monthly bur-sary payments were cut in December\nand January. No forewarning was given\nto the students; a blunder described as\n\u201cunfortunate\u201d by the Head of Department.\nNine of the affected students are supported by funding from the Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council\n(EPSRC) which sets a national minimum stipend designed to cover their\nliving costs. This amount for 2010-11\nis \u00a313,590 and increases in line with\ninflation each year; using the Treasury\u2019s\nGDP deflator, a measure of general in-flation. However, the EPSRC does not\nmake payments directly to students. It\ngives a block grant to Imperial, approximately \u00a36m, which is then distributed to\ndepartments who decide how much each\nstudent receives.\nIt is therefore the department that pays\nthe students an amount which, in previous years in the Aeronautics Department, has coincided with the EPSRC\nminimum stipend plus an additional\n\u2018London Living Allowance\u2019 of \u00a32000\nto cover the costs of living in the city.\nHowever, when the students checked\ntheir bank accounts in December, they\nnoticed they had been paid a reduced\nbursary that month, which adds up to a\ntotal cut of \u00a3223 for the year.\nThe Head of Department and Professor of Aerostructures, Professor Ferri M.\nH. Aliabadi said that the bursaries are set\nnot according to the EPSRC\u2019s rates, but\nby the College minimum rate for PhD\nstudents. He explained that, \u201cby mis-take, in October and November 2010,\nthe payments were made at a higher rate\nthan the College minimum recommen-dation. In December a correction was\nmade to the EPSRC bursary payments,\nreducing them by an average of \u00a318.50\nper month, to re-align the student bursa-ries with the College minimum.\u201d\nThe College minimum rate is determined by the College\u2019s Management\nBoard and is not directly linked to rates\noffered by research councils. The discrepancy of \u00a3223 for 2010/11 is because\nthe College\u2019s minimum rate increased\nby 0.5% while the EPSRC\u2019s minimum\nincreased by 2.5%.\nMalcolm Aldridge, the Head of the\nBursaries Payment Office, explained\nthat the staff pay throughout the College had also increased by 0.5% and that\nwhen the decision was made, there were\nsignificant pressures on higher education\ninstitutions to restrain pay increases.\nProfessor Aliabadi apologised for the\nLord Kerr steps\ndown from Council\nSearch for replacement begins: Page 3\nSophia David\nLord Kerr has been Chairman of the College Council since 2005\nNeville Miles/Imperial College London\n...Continued on Page 6\nPage 5\n\n"

And now I\u2019m wor-ried, because somehow I changed everything else too.\nHear me out: I did not change controls\nto stare at Lara\u2019s behind due to being\nsome sort of pervert. That is just a co-incidence. All I did was shift the Jump\ncommand on to the right-mouse button\nso I could streamline my tomb raiding.\nThat\u2019s it.\nNormally of course I\u2019d use a game-pad. I\u2019d have my thumb primed, curled\nlike a scorpion-tail over the x-button so\nI could jab \u2013 and jump \u2013 at the slightest provocation, occasionally giving the\nright-stick a quick nudge to shift the\ncamera into position; like say, a film\ndirector punching his cheap Hungarian\ncameraman. The focus was on controlling Lara\u2019s acrobatics, with the camera\nas my unruly lens on the action. A good\ncamera is revered in gaming, as can\nbe seen by the reams of praise reviewers give to capable game cameras, as\nif \u2018Looking The Right Way\u2019 was some\nstate of the art graphical effect.\nBut now I was being all trendy, playing games on my laptop using a mouse,\nmy left hand punching out a million anagrams of the WASD keys. Unwittingly,\nin using this set up I had changed the\nway the whole game felt to play. I was\nsuddenly able to both steer the camera\nand jump\u2026 at the same time! Freed\nfrom the alternating rhythm of camera\nchanges/climbing forced by pad play, I\nwas climbing and catapulting through\ntombs with the smooth grace of some,\ncuriously busty, underground Spiderman.\nEffectively I was controlling Lara like\nMarcus Fenix or Max Payne, forever\nrunning forward, gracefully steering my\nway around the environments with the\nmouse-camera and never seeing anything other than Lara\u2019s improbably proportioned backside.\nBut was it better? Sure my fluidity increased ten-fold and those tombs were\nprobably grateful to be raided at record\nspeed and have done with it, but something felt a bit off. I was used to feeling like I actually moved Lara around\nthe environments, like my gamepad\nbuttons were hooked up by strings to a\ndigital marionette on some pixel-pow-ered stage. Now instead my avatar was\nlocked in some eterna-run in the centre\nof the screen while I practically rotated\nthe whole world around her with the\nmouse. Egypt still looked like Egypt and\nthat T-Rex still filled the screen, but the\nsmall sliver of change had slid into my\npsyche and had turned Tomb Raider into\nsome kind of Tomb Runner.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it was still fun,\nperhaps even more fun than usual. But in\nchanging the control scheme I had stumbled upon something deeper: the delicate\nlink between control, camera and immer-sion, the role these play in the depiction\nof our avatar\u2019s physical presence in an\nenvironment and also just how obsessive\nI could be when my hard-wired expectations of a game are violated.\nDid I mention I originally preferred\nplaying it at 640x480 too?\nToo much of Lara Croft\u2019s bum\nOmar Hafeez-Bore wasn\u2019t trying to get a better view... honest!\nHave your say on this article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "16\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 28 January 2011\nJ\nanuary is generally not the best\nmonth in anyone\u2019s year. What\npassed for enjoyable, seasonal\nweather in December has become dreary, cold and depressing in the new year. For all Imperialites,\nthe first month of the year is stressful,\nsleep-scarce and just generally bollocks.\nWhile reading this on campus, there\nare two ways you could have reacted\nto the previous paragraph: by nodding your head in agreement more and\nmore vigorously, as you remember how\nbloody cold it was this morning (and\nyour unfinished lab report); or by telling\nme to fuck off if you know me. Chances\nare it\u2019ll have been the former. So, why\ndo all my friends hate me?\nTime to confess something: I\u2019m not\nin London, but in Spain, thanks to some\nlovely people at the EU (and a Renaissance humanist). I\u2019m spending my year\non the Spanish Mediterranean coast, in\nValencia. Two semesters that involve\nlearning some physics (no, really), some\nSpanish, and how to \u201ccommunicate\u201d\nwith the twenty-six other nationalities\nof the European Union. It\u2019s not exactly\nImperial. There are far too many beach-es, for a start. Not to mention the 20\u00baC\n\u201cwinter\u201d temperatures.\nWhat right do I have to be moping\nabout January, then? None, whatsoev-er. But if you\u2019ve got this paper in your\nhands then neither do you.\nOne of the first things that a Spanish\nperson on my course said to me was\n\u201cwhat are you doing in Spain, if you\u2019re\nat Imperial?\u201d I gave her the usual babble about the weather, the language, the\nculture and the people (thus understating\nthe relative importance of the weather)\n\u2013 but it got me thinking. Over the next\nfew weeks, as I discovered life under the\nsiesta regime, it was impossible to stop\ndrawing comparisons between London\nand Valencia. Culture shock probably\nisn\u2019t strong enough a word to describe\nit, but to compare the advantages and\ndisadvantages of life in the UK and in\nSpain would take an entire book, and\nI\u2019m going to let that be somebody else\u2019s\nproblem. For the skeptics who think that\nthere\u2019s no way that Spain could be worse\nthan the UK, I can give you reasons\nranging from the 20% unemployment\nrate to the seemingly arbitrary opening\nhours of shops.\nHowever, there is one side of things\nwhere the balance is tipped in London\u2019s\nfavour \u2013 the university itself. Don\u2019t get\nme wrong, Valencia has a really good\nuniversity with excellent lecturers, a\ndecent library, sports facilities and the\nlike\u2026yet it is simply incomparable to\nImperial. The two don\u2019t fit on the same\nscale. It\u2019s like comparing the Heathrow\nHoliday Inn to the Ritz.\n\u201cWorld-class\u201d is a term that gets bandied about by College PR people quite\na lot ; while it may be a bit over-used,\nit is unquestionably legitimate. Very few\nother institutions in the world can claim\nto have facilities on a par with us. We\nare spoilt; having free use of a gym and\na pool in the centre of London, societies\nfor everything you could possibly think\nof, an incredibly active student union\u2026\nthe list goes on (not forgetting the inimitable felix). The whole science campus\nhere has about as many cluster computers as the physics department at Imperial\nand its library covers about one floor of\nSouth Ken\u2019s.\nForget widescreens in booths in a\ncaf\u00e9; think CRT monitors and missing\nmice. But that\u2019s just the material side\nWish I was there...\nof things. Everything back home is so\nmuch more structured: for example,\nyou know what you have to hand in, to\nwho, and when. In Spain these are considered variables rather than constants,\nwhich ends up being a lot more stressful\nin the end. Not everything can be done\nma\u00f1ana.\nI\u2018m loving Spain, though, and I\u2019m loving my year abroad. One thing it\u2019s taught\nme so far is this: Don\u2019t take Imperial for\ngranted. Of course, I know that you expected a lot when you chose Imperial.\nI know that you pay more than Spanish\nstudents. I know that I\u2019m talking about\ntwo very different cultures.\nBut next time you\u2019re complaining\nabout how full of geeks this place is, or\nhow small the gym is, or how cold it is\nin January, go find an Erasmus student\nand ask him to compare their university\nto yours. You\u2019ll see how lucky you are.\nOh, and buy a thicker coat. You live\nin London, for god\u2019s sake, not Valencia.\nGoing to a Spanish university for a year makes you\nrealise just how fortunate we are to be at Imperial\nThe majority of students at this university,\none would hope, have a good idea of why\nthey are studying their particular subject and\nwhy they are at Imperial. To cut straight to\nthe point, it is commonly a combination of\nthe reputation and quality of an Imperial de-gree, the concentration of world-class and\ncutting-edge research and of course, that rejection letter from Oxford or Cambridge. We\njest, we jest. Put more simply, it is usually\neither because we want a high paying job, in\nfinance or industry, or because we wish to\nembark on an academic career.\nBut, while those things are what give our\ntime at Imperial drive and purpose \u2013 one\nwould hardly pull all-nighters every few\nmonths without expecting some significant\nreward at the end \u2013 it is the social experience that gives us joy and happiness. We\ndo not accept that the social life at Imperial is uniquely deficient. Quite the opposite,\nthere\u2019s a great vibrant social experience to\nbe had at this university and much of it is\npowered by our wonderful Clubs & Societies.\nAnd what a range and quality of Clubs\n& Societies we are blessed with. Without\nnaming any individually \u2013 for fear of causing\noffense by omission \u2013 the student organisations excel themselves each and every\nweek. From the sporting achievements of\nour athletes to events that professionals\ncouldn\u2019t hope to surpass, our students consistently show their worth and their passion\nfor the world beyond their studies.\nBut why is this important? Aside from the\nsubstantial amount of money that we raise\nfor charities, the extra-curricular activities\nmake Imperial, to be blunt, a bearable place\nto study. The large workload and difficult\nsubject matter can, at times, feel like an unbearable burden. It is extremely important\nthat we are able to escape our subjects for\na while and explore other disciplines. Which,\nfor the record, is not something that students at other universities are able to do to\nthe extent that we are \u2013 our Clubs & Societies are amongst the most successful, numerous and varied in the UK.\nWhen we have completed our degrees,\nwhether we have embarked on careers\nin the City, entered into research or some\nother path, we shall surely acknowledge that\nthe Imperial academic brand has carried us\nforward with some advantage. But when we\nlook back on our time here, we suspect that\nit will be those extra-curricular achievements\nof which we are most proud. That\u2019s why we\nraise our glasses, so to speak, to those cre-ative, energetic and enthusiastic students\nwho make our time at Imperial truly memorable and above all, fun.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 28 january 2011 21\nARTS\nLet\u2019s talk about\nClowning as a visual theatre is one less\ncommonly seen on the London stage.\nAnd Compagnia 2+1\u2019s performance of\ntheir show La Porta was definitely in\nkeeping with what most people think of\nas traditional clowning, complete with\nbrass, juggling, acrobatics, funny hairstyles and falling over.\nCompagnia 2 + 1 are comprised of\nSwiss clowning duo Bernard Stockli and\nAndreas Manz and clown and acrobat\nKai Leclerc. They hail from a very traditional clowning background, touring\nwith famous circus companies such as\nCircus Knie, Circus Monti and Barnum\nand Bailey. Leclerc is presented as the\nmultilingual, opera-singing, more serious 1. Whereas Stockli and Manz are the\nhopeless, but very endearing, 2.\nThe performance centres around a\nred door in the centre of the stage, La\nPorta, which facilitates an array of tricks\nand scenarios, as the performers come\nand go through the door and fight over\nits possession. The continued struggle\nover ownership of the door, however,\nwas tenuously linked to some other aspects of the show and when the clowns\nrepeatedly fought over it, it became a\nlittle tiresome. On the other hand, I particularly liked the use of the door as a\nportal to a skiing holiday, where a clown\nshivered under flurries of little paper\npieces, exaggeratedly blown at them by\nthe two others, then, as the little drifts of\npaper lay about the stage and were later\nkicked up again, the clowns gave a classic shiver of remembrance. At one point\nthe door came into its own as a character\nwhen it accidentally got caught in one of\nthe clowns\u2019 brawls and \u2018died\u2019 (wouldn\u2019t\nopen), and needed music in order to get\nit to open again.\nMany of the tricks performed by the\nThe Office with a taxidermied twist is\nan excellent description of this apocalyptic physical comedy from American\nduo Geoff Sobelle and Charlotte Ford.\nEmerging from an oversized bin and the\noffice toilet, Gerry and Rhoda appear\nready for a day at their workplace which\nis eerily devoid of any signs of other human life. Settling into their respective\nroutines, Rhoda obliviously indulges\nin her impulsive snacking habit whilst\nGerry begins compulsively rearranging\nhis post it note collection and obsessively stalks a particularly obnoxious fly.\nHowever the monotony of office routine\nis slowly shattered by the intrusion of\nsome rather unwelcome furry friends. A\nferret scuttles furtively across the floor,\na badger settles in between the folders,\nplants burst out of filing cabinets and a\ndeer or two appear casually from the behind the doors. Unable to cope with the\nexotic events of the day, predictably, the\ntwo workers give into their wild side and\nmayhem ensues leading to the final explosive climax involving the collapsing\nof walls and an ingenious bear attack all\nset to the sinister synthesized chords of\nDebussy\u2019s Claire de Lune.\nThere are some hilarious pantomime\nelements to this play. Taxidermied animals slowly creep into view causing\nyou to want to scream \u201cIt\u2019s behind you\u201d\nto the oblivious characters on stage,\nand their unpredictable reactions to the\nstrange events never fail to disappoint.\nBoth Sobelle and Ford possess that rare\ncomedic talent of pushing a joke to its\nabsolute limit without letting it wear\nthin, as well as a formidable mastery\nof the dramatic pause, employing ex-clowns were well executed and technically impressive. A Houdini-style escape from a box tied with ropes was\nexcellent and some fantastic acrobatics\nmime\nHerpreet Bhamra\nCecily Goodwin\nLondon\u2019s annual International mime\nfestival lands once again, showcasing\nphysical theatre from all over the\nworld. We tried just a couple to get a taste of what\u2019s been going on\nFlesh and Blood & Fish and Fowl (The Barbican)\nLa Porta (Southbank)\n\u201cThe door came into\nits own as a character when it acciden-tally... \u2018died\u2019\u201d\nwere performed around a lamp. One of\nmy favourite tricks was when Leclerc\ncan-canned across the stage singing an\naria whilst tearing up a copy of the evening standard and then opening it out\ninto a copy of Le Figaro. Although, in\nbetween these \u2018wow-factor\u2019 tricks the\nsequences of slapstick or competitive\ndoor-possession wore a little thin.\nThat said, the interaction between\nthe clowns themselves was very well\nportrayed and the characterisation was\nexcellent, making them very likeable.\nEach clown had characteristic facial\nexpressions, actions and movements\nthat were very charming, as evidenced\nby repeated \u2018awws\u2019 from the crowd.\nThis was something of an achievement\nas all three spent a large proportion of\nthe show striving to inflict pain on the\nothers.\nDespite the fact that sometimes the focus on the door seemed a little strained\nand that I personally don\u2019t find people\nbeing slapped in the face particularly\nfunny, the show was entertaining, the\ncharacters of the clowns were endearing and the execution of the tricks impressive and unpretentious. The perfect\nshow for anyone with a penchant for\nslapstick, and of course, the under 10s.\n\u201cTaxidermied animals\ncreep into view\u201d\ncellent comedic timing. The physical\ncharacterization of the neurotic, irritable\ncharacters perfectly captures the social\nawkwardness exploited so effectively\nby Ricky Gervais et al. but this physical\nportrayal gave it a refreshing and much\ndarker twist. The appearance of the taxi-dermied animals is well choreographed,\noften leaving you clueless as to which\noffice appliance they had materialized\nfrom this time, although from time to\ntime the flash of a hand quickly diving\nback behind the door that the pheasant\nhad appeared from ruined the magic of\nthe moment.\nThe ecological message of the play\nwas clear; in these concrete fortresses\nwe\u2019ve built, we\u2019ve removed ourselves\nso far from the natural world, that the\ntwo worlds cannot co-exist and this will\nbe to our own detriment. In the end the\nnatural order shall be restored. However, Sobelle and Ford manage to wonderfully entwine this with message with\nan absurd and hilarious physical comedy\nparodying the pressures of modern life.\nAll the fun of the fair, well, mainly just the clowns, but they are quite fun\nRhoda (Charlotte Ford) being chased in her office by stuffed wildlife\n\n"

However, the hospital did not have enough O negative blood for the life-saving\noperation he needed, so his friends in the UK made Facebook groups\ncalling for people to help out. After 24 hours thousands of people had\njoined to spread the word. Then amazingly, people started turning up at\nthe hospital to offer their blood.\nWhilst social networking may not have such a drastic effect on the\nlives of most of us, its impact is undeniable. LinkedIn is great for busi-ness, MySpace/last.fm for music, twitter for journalism with Facebook\na \u2018jack-of-all-trades\u2019 patriarchal figure. Each of these enhances how we\ninteract each other in different ways; there are bands I wouldn\u2019t have\nheard, news stories I wouldn\u2019t have found and events I wouldn\u2019t have\nattended if social media did not exist.\nWhilst like anything there are those who take social networking too\nfar, it is a fantastic tool if used correctly. It can connect you to anyone\nanywhere in the world, reunite lost friends and help to maintain long\ndistance friendships that might otherwise disintegrate.\nThe true global potential of the medium is perfectly demonstrated by\nthe recent story of Ashley Kerekes (aka @theashes), a 20 something\nAmerican twitter user. She woke up one day to find that a large number of people had sent her messages on twitter regarding the Ashes tour.\nHaving no idea about cricket she responded, initially with annoyance but\nthis then developed into full conversations. Soon she had thousands of\nfollowers and through the power of social networking was flown out to\nAustralia to watch the Ashes for real.\nThe social media revolution has without a doubt changed the way we\ninteract with each other and the wider world. It has provided a new easy\nway to communicate and for those who want it, a channel through which\nyour voice has the potential to be heard by millions.\n18 felix\nFRIDAY 28 January 2011\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nH\now many times have\nyou been introduced to\nsomeone of whom you\nwere already aware,\nperhaps the collateral\nof a recent facebook browse or, if\nyou\u2019re one of the pathetic many (like\nme), a target of a facebook stalk? Or\nat least made decisions based on relationship statuses as seen on facebook?\nSingles, haven\u2019t you checked out the guest list for a friend\u2019s party and\ndecided not to go because there weren\u2019t any fit single ladies attending?\n(There were a few in the \u201cMaybe attending\u201d and your wingman said let\u2019s\nrisk it for a biscuit but computer games won out in the end.)\nNon-singles, have you been jealous when you looked at every single\ntagged photo of your girlfriend from before you got together? And nearly\ndied when you looked through that album from a trip she took with her\nex-boyfriend?\nNone of this applies to me, of course, but you lot should be ashamed\nof yourselves! The way Facebook (more so than any other social networking site) has changed the way people interact is a disappointment.\nIt completely takes the mystery out of life, let alone making it a lot more\ndifficult to get away with lies. There was a time you could have got away\nwith bailing on a mate\u2019s birthday party, organising with other friends to\ngo clubbing and just maybe suggesting to go to the same club where the\ngirl you fancy just so happens to be going. But not anymore! Thanks to\nthe inevitable day-after-the-night-before album, your actions WILL be\nrecorded and you WILL be found out.\nSocial networks do have innumerable benefits of which I have definitely taken advantage, but I can\u2019t help feeling let down. I\u2019m a big fan of\ntradition, admittedly because I read too much Jane Austen, but romance\nis dead and I blame social networking, as it fosters a society which is too\nbusy for real-time contact with people. And how many times have you\nhad coffee with someone who checks twitter on their smartphone every\nfive minutes? While it helps people juggle their busy lives and is a bit of\nfun in easy reach, there is no substitute for real interaction. So please, I\nurge you to join me in mocking those who \u201ccheck-in\u201d everywhere they\ngo.\nMuch as I\u2019d like to resist social networking e.g. by boycotting or some\nsuch gesture, it\u2019s a lot of effort to follow through on my \u2018principles\u2019 only\nto become even more of a pleb. Safe to say, resistance is futile. Hey Trekkies, Seven of Nine is really hot isn\u2019t she? If I only I could \u201cnetwork\u201d\nwith her, then maybe I\u2019d stop complaining. Live long and prosper.\n\u201cIt can connect\nyou to anyone\nanywhere in\nthe world.\u201d\nBen Good Alex Nowbar\nWhether you spend your life tweeting or check\nyour Facebook page once a month, social\nnetworking is here to stay.The question is....\nTake the National Student\nSurvey,it will help\nimprove your course\nEver felt that your Department doesn\u2019t listen to your views? Want to thank them for\nall the hard work they have done or quite\nthe opposite? The National Student Survey\n(NSS) is a platform for you to voice your\npositive and negative opinions!\nIf you are a final year undergrad, you probably have already heard that the survey began on the 10 January. When I was asked\nto complete it last year, I had no idea what I\nwas filling out and I guess most of you feel\nthe same way. It\u2019s easy to complete and\nonly takes a few minutes, but does it really\nlive up to the hype? Yes.\nThe NSS isn\u2019t like other surveys. Over the\npast years, you\u2019ve been asked to complete\nnumerous surveys (and are probably sick of\nall the acronyms by now!). Whether SOLE,\nTOLE or ROLE, these all provide quality\nfeedback on specific issues which are going well (or not so well) in Departments. The\nNSS is different. It allows both College and\nthe Union to measure themselves against\nother UK institutions. Questions range from\nlearning provisions to Union activities. You\nget to let College know how you really felt\nabout your 3 or 4 years here. Oh, and did I\nmention it\u2019s anonymous?\nThe Union and your student reps encourage\npositive changes using this survey\u2019s results\nas (metaphorical) ammunition. Equipped\nwith views gathered from a large majority of\nstudents, it is hard for Departments to ignore major issues. It is important, however,\nto have a high participation rate, otherwise\nresults aren\u2019t representative.\nThe NSS has changed things in the past\nand you\u2019ve been reaping the benefits. Last\nyear the NSS showed that students weren\u2019t\nhappy with their coursework feedback. Resulting from that, we introduced a 2 week\nturnaround deadline and have clamped\ndown on Departments which have been lax\nwith feedback. I hope you have noticed the\ndifference! In the past, NSS results have\nalso played a key role in opening our beloved library resources 24hrs. Although the\nresulting action taken from the NSS will not\ndirectly impact your uni experience, your\nfeedback will allow prospective students to\nknow what they are getting into by applying\nto Imperial. The results also have an impact\non Imperial\u2019s standing in the League tables.\nAs with all surveys we run, we are providing some great incentive prizes to those\nwho complete it. We are giving away 6x \u00a320\nUnion Shop vouchers as well as 4x free\nEnts tickets to this year\u2019s massive Summer\nBall at the end of the year. All winners will\nalso receive free lifetime membership to\nthe Union! So make sure to complete the\nNSS under www.thestudentsurvey.com\nVery soon the people running the survey\nwill begin targeting those of you who have\nnot completed it via post, email and even\ntelephone so get on it before they begin annoying you!

Don\u2019t be cruel.\nFriday 28 JANUARY 2011\nD IE FA C EBOOK D IE!!!\nI\u2019ve been a bonafide member of The Facebook\nfor three years now. It\u2019s a great tool for keeping\nin touch with old friends and grooming young\nchildren. However, of late, something very bad\nhas started happening every time I log in.\nA continuous stream of suffocatingly dull\ninformation seems to be flowing, from the peripheries of my life in to my news feed, as if it\nwere some virtual septic tank with an infinite\ncapacity for inane bollocks.\nHaving consulted others it seems that this is\na ubiquitous phenomenon, but if you aren\u2019t familiar with it here are a few cases in point from\nsome people who used to be my friends:\n\u201cSally: Going to finally go do some washing,\nlol :P.\u201d\n\u201cSimon: O2 put me on hold!\u201d\n\u201cKyle: Turns out my phone was under the\nsofa cushion. LOL! So glad to have it back.\u201c\n\u201cHannah: Just bit my tongue and it hurts\nsooooo much :(. \u201d\n\u201cTimmy: The train I\u2019m on is so slow!!!!\u201d\nSally, Simon, Kyle, Hannah and Timmy all\nhave one thing in common: the audacity to presume anyone gives a shit. And there are literally hundreds of thousands more like them out\nthere.\nLet\u2019s take a minute to consider a real-life\nanalogy. Recall a social event you recently\nattended, possibly a dinner party. The main\ncourse has just been served; it looks delicious.\nSharp wit is abounding around one end of the\ntable and at the other a deeply profound yet entirely unpretentious conversation is being had.\nThen suddenly from one corner of the room\nsomeone you knew you were never quite sure\nabout pipes up, possibly even referring to\nthemselves in third person, \u201cAndrew thinks the\nweather\u2019s so nice today :).\u201d Confused, you look\nover atAndrew but before you can say anything\nsomeone else has butted in, \u201cSarah h8s spiders!\nLOL,\u201d says Sarah sat to your left. Gradually\nmore and more people start saying uninteresting things, \u201cMy dog just woofed and it sounded\nso funny :P ,\u201d \u201cJust finished tidying my room,\nso happy!\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep last night :(.\u201d\nThe room begins to crescendo and before you\nknow it the whole party has exploded in to an\norgy of stock phrases and mundane statements.\nHaving studied this process extensively it\u2019s\nbecome clear to me that drabness is being\ndisseminated via a handful of primary forms.\nBrief descriptions of a few are given below:\nThe Moaner: This can range from something\nentirely trivial, \u201cPotatoes for dinner, I hate potatoes!\u201d to something really deep like, \u201cI thought\nI saw the light but its slowly disappearing\nnow...*sigh*.\u201d Both are equally dull. A female\nmoaner is often responded to by either friends\nThe Zuckerface can live, but only if defeats the Winklevi in a bare-knuckle fight!\nSexyOsama69\nYeah, from me lol\nThe_Cleggomatortrontown <3\nuprisings and protests. Demonstrators calling for political\nreforms\nChow Yun Fat\n(Ed \u2013 Who the fuck?)\nleading equally uneventful lives, \u201cIs everything okay hun?\u201d or creepy balding older men,\n\u201cGimme a call if you want to talk to someone.\u201d\nThe Shameless Gloater: Strictly speaking not\nthat dull but worth a mention anyway. These\ntypes are usually involved in one of the creative industries and feel obliged to give a running commentary of absolutely everything that\nhappens to them. A lot of stuff tends to happen\nto them because they\u2019re pretty cool but they\u2019re\ncompletely un-cool for telling everyone about\nit. News like \u201cBackstage at Jay-Z\u201d is often met\nwith a string of \u201clikes\u201d, every single one of them\na lie, but then there isn\u2019t a \u201cbitter and jealous because I\u2019m at home crying and wanking\u201d button.\nThe New Year Special: At New Year\u2019s facebook took a real beating. In fact it\u2019s a miracle\nthat it didn\u2019t just break. A cringe was waiting to\nbe had everywhere you looked, \u201c2011, gonna\nmake it really happen this year!\u201d \u201cYes 2011!\nYou couldn\u2019t have come at a better time!\u201d\n\u201cHappy 2011 guys, can\u2019t wait to share all the\ngreat times we\u2019re gonna have :P.\u201d\nUltimately they all said the same thing, \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna write a status about \u2018making it\u2019 in 2011,\nand then do nothing about it...that\u2019ll make\npeople think I\u2019m a success! 2011 MY YEAR\nGUYZ WATCH OUT IM\u2019A BE DOING IT!!\u201d\nThe Meal Photo Mobile Phone Upload\n(MPMPU): Pretty simple concept here: cook\na nice meal; let everyone on facebook know\nabout it by uploading a photo of it. Unfortunately this is usually done with a shit quality\ncamera phone making it look like someone\u2019s\njust gone and vomited on a plate. Responses\ngenerally involve a chorus of moronic \u201cOooo,\nlooks yummy, why wasn\u2019t I invited to dinner?!\u201d or something to that effect.\nIf social interaction has been degraded to\nimages of food flying across screens followed\nby banal expressions of approval it\u2019s probably\ntime to throw the towel in; go live in isolated\ncubicles and break off communication with\none another all together. These guys are usually\nshameless gloaters as well (see above).\nFacebook used to be the kind of thing you could\nuse to find out what films people were in to; find\nout what your friends\u2019favourite quotes were and\ncollect top notch wank-bank deposits from people you know with out them knowing.Now, all of\nthat is being overwhelmed by an army of bores\nbent on contaminating everyone else\u2019s lives with\nthe day-to-day humdrum of their own. There\u2019s\nreally only one solution; a witty friend of mine\nput it succinctly just the other day, \u201cToby feels\nthis particular mode of self expression should\nbe made unobtainable to the insipid masses frequenting my news feed... you\u2019re hungry... real-ly... you\u2019re bored... cool... you\u2019re dying... good.\u201d\n\u201cFacebook is being\noverwhelmed by an\narmy of bores bent on\ncontaminating everyone\nelse\u2019s lives\u201d\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\nahhh shit, think my phone might\nhave been hacked\nSexyOsama69\nyeah, by me lol\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\nNah, I\u2019m being serious. Getting\nblackmail threats\nSUPERACEGORTHEROAR87\noh lol\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nYou heard about Egypt, Tunisia\nand Yemen?\nBarack_attack_l33thaxor\nNo. What\u2019s going on?\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nDunno\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nOh :( Thought it was a bomb or\nsomething\n\n"

The briefing included an announcement inviting members of the College to encourage people\nthey know as suitable candidates to express interest.\nJohn Olav Kerr, Baron Kerr of Kinlochard took up the post of Imperial\u2019s\nChairman of Court and Council in January 2005. He was ambassador and UK\npermanent representative to the EU for\nfive years and became Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director\nof Shell. Educated in Pembroke College, Oxford, Lord Kerr is also a Fellow\nof the Royal Society of Edinburgh and\nhad commented \u201cto work for Imperial is\na huge honour. They are, and will stay,\nsecond to none.\u201d\nThe role of Chairman of College\u2019s\nCouncil is of international standing and\nthe person appointed will have many\ncontacts in the higher reaches of gov-ernment, industry or other influential\nbodies. They will be expected to lead\nthe Council and work with the Rector\nclosely in order to fulfill its responsibilities regarding the governance and direction of the College.\nAs the search for Chairman com-mences, speculation has arisen over\nwho would be appropriate to succeed\nLord Kerr. The resulting candidate will\nbe invited for an informal and confidential discussion with the Search Committee, which is chaired by Lord Tugendhat, who is the Chairman of the Imperial\nCollege Healthcare NHS Trust and is an\nexternal member of Council. The position is not paid.\nThe Council of Imperial College is defined by Royal Charter as the \u201cgoverning and executive body of the College\u201d,\nresponsible for finance, property, investments and general business, and for setting the general strategic direction of the\ninstitution. There are nineteen members\nof Council with a majority being lay\nmembers. The Council holds meetings\nat least three times during the academic\nyear and are further tasked with important decisions and recommendations influencing the appointment of high profile\npositions in College, such as the Rector.\nMembers of the College are invited to\nencourage suitable candidates to email\ncollege.secretary@imperial.ac.uk expressing their interest by the 11th of\nFebruary. As previously, the post hopes\nto attract senior and respected individuals with great competency in finance and\npolitics.\nAlex Karapetian\nCorrection\nIn the article entitled \u201cFeasibility of longer day called\ninto question\u201d (Issue 1479 \u2013\n21/01/11), it was suggested\nthat Professor Julia Buckingham said, \u201cstaff and students\nwould be expected to work\nlonger hours\u201d. She actually\nsaid that they would not. Felix\napologises for this typo. Editor\nProfile: Lord Kerr Who might replace him?\nBaron Kerr of Kinlochard \u2013 more\ncommonly known as Lord Kerr \u2013\nwas born in Grantown-on-Spey,\nScotland in 1942. He was educated at Glasgow Academy and\nPembroke College, Oxford, holding honorary degrees from the\nUniversities of St Andrews, Aston\nand Glasgow. He joined the UK\nDiplomatic Service in 1966 which\nincluded postings at the British\nEmbassy in Moscow, and at the\nHigh Commission in Pakistan.\nKerr was seconded to the Treasury from 1979 to 1984 and became Principal Private Secretary\nto two Chancellors of the Exchequer. He was Ambassador and\nUK Permanent Representative to\nthe European Union from 1990 to\n1995 and then became Ambassador to the US in Washington until\n1997 before returning to London.\nHe was awarded the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael\nand Saint George, appointed CMG,\nKCMG and GCMG in 2001. He\nserves in the Law and Institutions\nsub committee of the EU Select\nCommittee in the House of Lords\nand is the Chairman of the Centre\nfor European Reform and Vice President of the European Policy Centre.\nHe also took the role of Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign\nOffice and Head of the Diplomatic\nService, after which he became\na director of Shell Transport and\nTrading (now Royal Dutch Shell plc),\nchairing the group of Directors. He\nis now Deputy Chairman and Senior\nIndependent Director. Lord Kerr is a\nFellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 2004, he was created\na life peer as Baron Kerr of Kinlochard. He later acquired the role of\nChairman of the Court and Council\nof Imperial College from 2005.\nA poll by the Association of Graduate\nRecruiters (AGR) of 222 recruiters in\nthe UK reveals an 8.9% annual increase\nin graduate jobs, with a forecast of a further 3.8% increase for this year.\nThe survey indicates that salaries are\nlikely to remain static. The average salary is predicted to stay at \u00a325,000 for an\nunprecedented third year.\nCarl Gilleard, chief executive of the\nAGR, stated: \u201cWhat tended to happen\nin the past [recessions] is that employers put the brakes on, and only took their\nfoot off a year or two later. Then they\nfound they didn\u2019t have the talent in their\norganisation to cope with growth.

The\nUK has a thriving indie and dramatic\nscene, however we thought it was high\ntime to flag some rising Hollywood stars\n(and their films/shows) who deserve to\nbe on your radar. Who are we kidding?\nThis liberal newspaper needs more\nthan naturist-inspired weekly centerfolds to sate a college-level appetite for\neye-candy. It\u2019s relatively easy to find\nmouthwateringly sexy Hollywood ac-tors, however when considering what\nancillary characteristics might intrigue\nour science, tech and business-oriented\nstudent body, Ian Somerhalder easily\ntops the list. Your blank stare, squeals\nof \u201cBoone\u201d (Lost), or drool pooling on\nyour well-worn copy of Entertainment\nWeekly\u2019s Sexiest Beast issue slots you\ninto either the uninitiated or swooning\nfan category.\nSomerhalder\u2019s current fan-fave sexy\nbeast Damon Salvatore (of hit US\nshow The Vampire Diaries) won. Hey,\nyou must be doing something right if\nyou\u2019ve managed to take the New York\nPost PopWrap\u2019s Best of 2010 Television\nNo. 1 rank, as judged by a full-blooded\nmale TV critic!

However,\nit\u2019s not only Somerhalder\u2019s compelling\nand often eerie performance, suggestive of future box office potential \u00e0 la\nJohnny Depp, which convinced us to do\na profile. If you\u2019re in the mood to dive\ninto the indie and smaller budget drama\nflicks Somerhalder\u2019s acted in, you\u2019re in\nfor a treasure-trove full of sexy and hilarious moments. Our favorites are The\nRules of Attraction, Life As A House\nand Wake.\nThe Rules of Attraction is a delightfully dark and twisted satire of university life. Amongst an ensemble of drug-addled, sexually promiscuous misfits,\nSomerhalder plays a disaffected, cynical\nbisexual student dealing with the harsh\nrealities of a straight crush. Highlights\ninclude the most sexy and hilarious\nmethod of an undressed male selecting an outfit in digital existence. Best\nwatched with your girl/boyfriend; this\nedgy, extremely liberal flick just can\u2019t\nstop flaunting everything from straight\nsex, to male-on-male action, to a house\nfull of naked ladies.\nLife As A House is a surprisingly\nquirky, humorous, sad and profound tale\nabout a terminally ill architect searching\nfor the existential meaning of his life\nby constructing his dream home alongside his drug-addicted son (Star Wars\u2019\nHayden Christensen). Somerhalder\u2019s\nroaring entrance in a red Porsche catalyzes the story\u2019s abrupt departure from\nemo-fest to hilariously dark as his cocky\npimp/drug dealer character rips through\nthe veil of the film\u2019s seemingly idyllic\nneighborhood via activities like an ongoing tryst with the local cougar.\nWake is an indie romcom with drama/\ngothic/thriller overtones that led the\nCinequest Film Festival\u2019s opening night.\nSomerhalder plays the widow-with-a-secret of a mysteriously deceased\nwoman and the new love interest of a\ndark, quirky girl who attends strangers\nfunerals to entertain herself. Hilarious\nromantic and murder investigation hi-jinks ensue.\nSomerhalder\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t\nrely on his trademark sultry stare. He\nFELIX 27\nFriday 28 January 2011\nOscars\nhas a peculiar quirk, adding character\nthrough facial micro expressions and\neyebrows with a life of their own. Perhaps this is why he\u2019s won over critics\nand was nominated for Best Drama Actor in the People\u2019s Choice Awards. Or\nmaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s one of a only\nhandful of actors who can pull off the\n\u201csympathetic murder,\u201d ripping characters\u2019 hearts out. By hand. (Recall: Emmy\nnods to Dexter). Most actors play hero\non screen, however Somerhalder favours\nthe antagonist. Chances are, it\u2019s because\nhe has a hero complex in real life.\nHe recently started the Ian Somerhalder Foundation (ISF) to foster youth-led\nawareness initiatives within the realms\nof animal welfare, environmental issues\nand clean energy as well as to \u201cfund applications and sources for green energy.\u201d\nHe\u2019s personally involved in a green power entrepreneurial venture (Go Green\nMobile Power). He became quite a large\npresence within social and mainstream\nUS media this past year due to his vocal\nstatements and awareness-raising during the BP Gulf Oil Spill. Inspiring and\ncollaborating with an increasingly large\nset of fan-initiated awareness and fundraising groups, he\u2019s also spoken on a\npanel at the Washington Energy Summit\nand, as a spokesperson for the Alliance\nfor Global Conservation, will be going\non a mission to Central America to assess environmental issues which he\u2019ll\npresent to Congress in autumn 2011.\nFor more information, volunteering, or\nto find out how the IS Foundation may\nbe able to assist projects in Imperial\u2019s\nmyriad of student energy, environmental and entrepreneurial clubs or research\nprogrammes, check out www.isfounda-tion.com (Twitter: @IS_Foundation, Facebook: Ian Somerhalder Foundation).\n\u201cGutsy\u201d Black Swan should get Best Picture\nEd Knock\nIt\u2019s all too was easy to say that this\nyear\u2019s Oscars is going to be exciting\nbut I do believe that the 51st Academy Awards are going to be a bit spe-cial. Whereas previous years have been\ndominated by a few strong contenders\n( There Will be Blood and No Country For Old Men 2007) or a weak field\n(2006) or just ridiculous hysteria for\none film (Slumdog Millionaire, 2009),\nthis season\u2019s Oscars have few clear\nfavourites.\nThe Best Picture category is definitely\nan open race with the possibility of ten\nfilms (enlarged last year) taking home\nthe prized statuette.

Personally I would love it if Black Swan won\nBest Picture, it\u2019s simply an incredibly\ngutsy piece of filmmaking both terrifying and sexy at the same time and Darren Aronofsky is due some recognition\nfrom the Academy.\nColin Firth is clear favourite for best\nactor and I\u2019m sure he will take home\nthe precious award in Febuary.

    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX\n8\nFeatures Editor: Lizzy Crouch\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 28 january 2011\nBen is a postgraduate student\nat Imperial College. In December\n2007 he was commuting from\nBrighton to work in London. One\nparticular day he had a headache\non the way to the station. After 15\nminutes on the train, he decided\nto go home, thinking he just had\na nasty bug. It was not until days\nlater, when he eventually went into\nhospital, that a doctor told him that\nhe had kidney failure. \u201cThat was\nsomething I\u2019d never really given\nany thought to beforehand\u201d, he\nsays. \u201cI had had a bit of nausea\nin the past few weeks, but hadn\u2019t\nthought any more of it.\u201d Doctors\ndidn\u2019t know why Ben\u2019s kidneys had\nfailed, and he still doesn\u2019t know to\nthis day. But he needed a transplant as soon as possible.\nBen went on dialysis immediately.\n\u201cI had to be hooked up to a machine three times a week. It has an\nenormous impact on your life. There\nare all sorts of things you can\u2019t eat.\nEverything becomes about that. All\nthose things you took for granted,\nyou can\u2019t do, and your whole life is\nbeing put on hold.\u201d\nHis family immediately started\nlooking for a donor. Ben\u2019s sister,\nSimone, was a match, meeting all\nthe requirements for organ dona-tion. For her, it was a no-brainer. \u201cIt\nseemed clear from early on that he\nneeded a transplant. It was not a\nhard decision to make. He needed\nsomething, so I gave it to him.\u201d\nBefore the transplant could occur,\nthe two had to go to a councillor, to\nensure that there was no coercion\ninvolved. Simone says that as she\nwent in for the operation, doctors\noffered to tell her family there was\na medical reason not to go ahead,\nif she wanted to change her mind.\nIn August 2008, after 7 months\nof dialysis, the transplant went\nahead. For Ben the chance to get\nback to living his life was an incredible gift from his sister. \u201cThere is\nno chance of me ever forgetting\nwhat she has given me. You cannot underestimate what an amazing thing organ donors give to the\npeople on the transplant list.\u201d\nThe operation has left a lasting\nimpact on both of them. Simone\u2019s\nimmune system has been weakened and she is prone to infection.\n\u201cI can still go out and stuff, but it\ndoes have an impact.\u201d But she has\nno regrets about the decision that\nshe made.\nIt is almost certain that Ben will\nneed another transplant in the fu-ture. \u201cI try not to think about it, but\nat least this time I will be more prepared.\u201d For now, he is determined\nto live the life that his sister has\ngiven back to him.\nI\nmagine. Something in your machinery has stopped working.\nSomewhere in your body, a vital\norgan, your kidneys, eyes, your\nheart, has malfunctioned. Your\ndoctor says that the damage is irreversible and that you need a replacement.\nFor nearly 8,000 people in the UK currently waiting for an organ transplant,\nthis is a reality. Their life is on hold until one becomes available. Fortunately,\n96% of us would be willing to give our\norgans to those patients after our deaths.\nYet only 27% of Britains are on the\nregister to donate and a shortage of organs is the biggest problem facing NHS\nBlood and Transplant services (NHS-BT). This week Felix spoke to Dr. Lorna\nWilliamson, Medical and Research Director of NHSBT, who highlighted the\ntrue consequence of such a shortfall;\nthat \u201c3 people a day will die before an\norgan becomes available\u201d.\nAt present the UK has an opt-in sys-tem, where you have to sign up to donate organs after your death. So why are\nthere so few people doing so?\nFor many of us, it is unpleasant to\nthink about and easy to be put off. But\nby thinking about it now we could save\nlives later. Dr. Williamson explained\nthat for the families of deceased organ\ndonors, the knowledge that lives have\nbeen saved can continue to be a great\nsource of comfort for a number of years.\nSome people worry about being on the\nregister; for example some imagine that\ndoctors might give up on them earlier so\nthat their body parts can be used. There\nis no need to be concerned about this.\n\u201cNo one knows whether a patient is on\nthe register until the point at which it\nis clear that other treatment would not\nbe beneficial to that patient. And in fact\ndeath has to be certified by two doctors\nwho have nothing to do with the transplant team.\u201d\nWhat is important to remember is that\nanyone could suddenly find themselves\nrequiring a transplant: two major causes\nof kidney failure are hypertension and\ndiabetes, both common diseases in the\nUK. Chronic liver disease, a common\ncause for liver transplantation, claims\n13,000 lives a year in the UK and can be\ncaused by excessive alcohol consump-tion; something of a national occupa-tion.\nIf you suddenly found yourself in need\nof a new organ, the first job for NHSBT\nwould be to find a match. Dr. Williamson explained that familial donations\nare preferable to deceased transplanta-tion, \u201cpartly because the whole thing\nhas been planned, so you can have the\ndonor and the recipient in the same hos-pital, and can go straight from one to the\nother. And also because if it is a relative,\nthey will be a particularly good match.\u201d\nIn the case of kidney failure, patients\nwaiting to find a match can be sustained\nvia dialysis. However, the average waiting time is well over 1000 days and with\nother conditions there may be no other\noption besides transplantation. Dr. Williamson highlighted that \u201cfor some patients with acute liver failure, for exam-ple, they really only have days or weeks\nin which to have the possibility of an\norgan transplant, and it may even be too\nlate for them\u201d.\nFor the recipient of a donation, the\nprocedure is not without its side effects\nand transplanted organs do have an expiry date which may require the patient\nto re-register for another subsequent\ntransplant.\nThe system has been set in place to\nrun as smoothly as possible. But with\n8,000 people currently requiring organs,\nand only 3,000 operations a year, getting\nmore people to sign up for the register is\nvital for saving more lives.\nExperts look to Spain as a country\nwhich has been successful in this. There,\nbeing an organ donor is seen as the\nnorm. Experts think a change in culture\nis needed here.\nThat is part of the reason an opt-out\nsystem, where everyone is on the register unless they state otherwise, was\nrejected by a government task force in\n2008. According to writer and committee member Vivienne Parry, \u201cpresumed\nconsent would not increase the number\nof donors and might do the opposite.\u201d\nShe felt it was all down to trust. Assuming people were willing to give organs\nwithout really asking them might alienate people further from the system. For\nmany people who have donated organs,\nan opt-out system would fundamentally\nchange the relationship between donor\nand recipient. It would become taking\nrather than giving.\nMost people sign up to the organ donor register when they get their first\ndriving license. As of this year, that process will be changed. \u201cRather than just\nskipping over the question, you have to\neither register or put a positive tick in\nthe box that says \u2018no\u2019, so it\u2019s as easy to\nsign up as to put it off,\u201d says Dr Williamson.\nThere are also problems getting the\nright mix of ethnicities and age groups\nto meet patients\u2019needs. People from ethnic minority groups are underrepresented on the register, yet are highly likely to\nneed an organ due to high rates of diabetes and hypertension. Finding matches\nfor children of mixed-race couples could\nBen was given a second chance by his sister\u2019s donation\nalso be difficult, as fewer people on the\nregister will match their genetic profile.\nThis is why a lot of research has gone\ninto finding transplant methods which\ndon\u2019t require a blood and tissue match.\nLast year a patient was given a donor\ntrachea that had been stripped to its collagen base and covered in the patient\u2019s\nown stem cells. The body recognised the\norgan as belonging to the recipient, so\nimmune-suppressants were not required\nto prevent rejection. There is even research on building an organ from scratch\nusing a patient\u2019s stem cells. However,\nthese measures are a long way off, and\nin the short term, NHSBT is focussed\non raising awareness and improving the\nway they look after the patients who\nneed transplants now.\nSo what can you do? When finding\nways to put off writing that lab report,\ngo to the NHSBT website and sign up to\nbe an organ donor. Your procrastination\ncould save lives.\nThe UK\u2019s organ shortage kills 3\npeople every day...\nKaty Bettany and Anna Perman on why you should donate\nTom Welch\n\n"

A largely\ngeneric forgettable lower mediocre\ntrack, and lacks all of the charm a delicacy that made her first album \u2018Youth\nNovels\u2019 such a pleasing listen.

Only three guitar-based\ntunes were featured in the UK\u2019s\ntop 100 best-selling songs of\n2010. It gets even more depressing when you realise that half of the top\n40 songs featured were by David Guetta, Black Eyed Peas or Rihanna.\nI still believe there is hope yet for rock.\nEven more so when I meet unsigned\nbands who remain optimistic about the\nfuture of independant rock. The Vetoes\nare that sort of band. After moving from\nReading to London for their studies,\nThe Vetoes developed their unique take\non rock.

And gradually\nwe\u2019ve been fighting against everything\nBalls out rock at 19.02\nGreg Power spoke to alt-rockers The Vetoes, headliners of the first\nFelix Music Night who promise to bring the balls back to rock\nthat guitar rock means.\nAndy (bass, vocals): Nowadays we\u2019re\nworking at writing for other people to\nlisten to our music rather than just us.\nYou know, that\u2019s Lead Guitarist Syndrome, you get obsessed with what\nyou\u2019re doing. But we\u2019ve been so conscious for the past year about writing for\nother people, so we\u2019re gradually shaping\nour own sound now.\nJames (drums): I think as a band at the\nmoment what we\u2019re aiming to do is just\nmake good music, but make it quite interesting and a bit different, because I\njust think everything out there is so boring right now.\nTobias: People look at us and tell us\n\u201cWrong time to be a guitar band, huh?\u201d.\nWhat that\u2019s turned into for most people\nis some kind of super-duper styled guys,\ngrinding through chords and singing\nsongs about girls, and how much girls\nhurt some times. And it\u2019s just fundamentally uninspiring. But there\u2019s always\nbeen something about guitar music that\nhas excited people. Whether it was Nirvana in 1994, or Radiohead in 1997...\nAndy: It\u2019s just something that people are\nalways going to be able to relate to. The\nguitar\u2019s a very human instrument. But\nthere\u2019s such a breadth of sounds you can\nmake with a guitar. There\u2019s never really\ngoing to be a limit to what you can do\nas a guitar band. There\u2019s always new\nsounds you can create.\nJames: I think I\u2019m kind of fed up with\nrock at the moment because it\u2019s just so\nnot rock. When you\u2019re a rock drummer,\nyou get on stage and you get topless and\nyou smash the drums as hard as you can.\nSo many bands now are boring. They\u2019re\nVetoes: making rock kinky again\nnot even doing anything musically inter-esting, and they look bored on stage.\nWhat are some of your influences?\nTobias: It\u2019s weird how our influences\nwork, because I can tell you some of\nmy favourite bands, Andy\u2019ll tell you his,\nJames\u2019ll tell you his and they\u2019ll be so different but we can have points at which the\nreasons why we like them are the same.\nOne band that me and Andy really like\nis Radiohead, because every song is\nunique and exiciting in its own way. But\nthen I like kind of hardcore punk stuff,\nfrom the schizoid stuff of Blood Brothers, to the nuts-out weird vocals of Future of the Left. And the balls that you\nget from that kind of rock. Mixed in with\nsome of the intricacies, and the openness,\nand the textures of some of the indie\nbands. Wild Beasts have a really great\nopen kind of feel to them\u2026 but with the\nballs. I think the balls are what people are\nmissing. Just the cojones man. Cojones!\nAndy: I guess we try and bring the fun\nelement of bands that are gonna make\nyou move, like Foals. On the punk\nscene you have Johnny Foreigner,\nthey\u2019re just so much fun. We\u2019re trying\nto combine that fun with really intricate\nguitar arrangements.\nTobias: We\u2019ve shifted our focus from\n\u201cI like playing that. I\u2019ll play my good\npart.\u201d to saying just \u201cHow does this\nmake me feel?\u201d. And that\u2019s what music\u2019s about. Making people feel some-thing. Whether it\u2019s about making people\nfeel scared, happy and elated or making\nthem just want to boogie their arse off.\nThat\u2019s what we want to do. It\u2019s liberating in a way because you\u2019re not worried\nparticularly about what you\u2019re playing,\nyou\u2019re just in the moment, enjoying it.\nI think we\u2019re working out if you can\u2019t\nmake something good with four chords,\nand one time signature and rhythmic\nfeel, then you\u2019re not going to make\nsomething good that has a million of\nthem. We\u2019ve learnt to restrain ourselves,\nand just try to make good music that\u2019s\nthere for itself and for people to listen to.\nWhat will you guys bring to 19.02?\nTobias: We can bring a shitload of ener-gy. We\u2019ll just be nuts, and make people\nwant to jump up and down.\nAndy: We are the kind of people that you\ncould take home to meet your grand-mother. But when we get up on stage,\nwe kind of change. So, you know, I\u2019m\nlooking forward to it.\nJames: Sex, drugs, rock n\u2019 roll!\nTobias: Except without the sex and the\ndrugs...\nThe Vetoes are having a launch party\nfor their new EP Ritalin / Ritalout on\nFebruary 7th at The Social (\u00a35).\nHear and see more of The Vetoes\nalong with the extended video interview at www.beholdthemachine.\ncom.\n\n"
