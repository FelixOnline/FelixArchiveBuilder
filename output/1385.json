Some laud it and some loathe it but like it or not, the Gherkin \u2013 officially recognised as 30 St Mary Axe \u2013 is here to stay. The pi\u00e8ce de resistance is the last two floors in the\nnose cone of the tower, a glass bubble with uninterrupted 360-degree views. For once, the interior justifies\nthe word sensational. There is nothing to get in the way of a breathtakingly awesome view.\nBishopsgate Tower\nArchitect - Kohn Pedersen Fox\nAnother proposition amongst the plethora of proposed new skyscraper projects in the square\nmile, The Bishopsgate Tower is the brainchild of high-rise specialists Kohn Pedersen Fox, designers of the World Financial Centre in Shanghai. If built, it will become the tallest building\nin Britain \u2013 depending on whether the Shard is built first \u2013 and one of the tallest in Europe.\nThe design looks enticing. Nicknamed variously \u201cThe Pinnacle\u201d and \u201cThe Helter Skelter\u201d, the\ntower is one of a few that has enraged those obsessed with preserving the air of the old city,\nthough at what price progress? All we know is, it looks awesome.\nThe Shard\nArchitect \u2013 Renzo Piano\nThough only a proposition, the prospect of this 310 metre Renzo Piano-designed creation is\ncontroversial although, like the Gherkin, it has the potential for rejuvenation \u2013 call it urban\nre-branding, if you will. A slender, spire-like form at odds with the rotundity of its contemporaries across the river, it is not only the design that is intriguing. Piano proposes sophisticated\nuse of glazing, with expressive facades of angled panes to reflect light and the changing patterns of the sky, so that the form of the building will alter according to the weather and seasons \u2013 having said that, you couldn\u2019t expect get that much more dramatic than it already is.\nTate Modern\nArchitect \u2013 Herzog & De Meuron\nPossibly one of the most intimidating gallery spaces in any major\ncity, the Tate Modern is a remarkable creation. Renovated and redesigned from the shell of the former Bankside Power Station and\nreopened in the new millennium, this huge space looms dauntingly\nover the South Bank \u2013 after late night openings, the Tate oozes menace but looks fresh and inspiring all the same. Inside, the huge turbine hall is a stark reminder of the building\u2019s origins and its annual\nsolo exhibitionist is always a hot topic amongst the city\u2019s urbanites.\nJust outside is the infamous \u201cshard of light\u201d millennium bridge \u2013\nnow stable and affording some of the best river views at night.\nWritten by David Paw, designed by Rosie Grayburn\nNext Week...\nIs there a particular guide you\u2019d like?

    "content": "10 felix Friday 2 November 2007\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Science\nThe internet has made access to news\nand sharing of information extremely\nsimple. The success of video sharing\nwebsite YouTube shows how popular\nand easy it is to share and recommend\nvideos to other people, with many getting more than 1 million views.\nEven established news websites such\nas the BBC and CNN encourage more\ninformation sharing by allowing readers to bookmark stories on Facebook\nor to get news direct to their mobile or\nemail. Millions of people can be reading a single news story or viewing the\nsame video simultaneously, in which\ncase these stories are said to have the\npopulation\u2019s collective attention.\nHowever, as popular as they might\nbe at the time, interest in a news story\ncan rapidly decline and the novelty\ncan soon wear off, be it from a lack of\npeople spreading the story or from too\nmuch exposure.\nUsing the novelty news website digg.\ncom to do their research, scientists in\nAmerica have studied the collective attention of 1 million users to see if they\ncould quantify the loss of novelty.\nFor those of you unacquainted with\ndigg.com, the concept is simple: news\narticles from the internet, both novel\nand serious, are posted by the users of\nthe site. Users have full control of what\nis displayed, by recommending stories\nChristiana Christodoulou in the \u201cUpcoming Stories\u201d section to\nother readers. Users who \u2018digg\u2019 the\nstory in this manner increase its digg\nrating, keeping the story on the front\npage.\nAs one would expect, on breaking a\nstory generates a large amount of in-terest, which increases as news of the\nstory spreads, but this interest soon\ndecreases as the novelty wears off. This\nis reflected by the rate at which a story\nreceives a digg.\nEventually a story is removed from\nthe main pages and put into the archive sections where it generates little\ninterest.\nFor their research the scientists\nquantified the novelty of a story by a\nfactor known, unsurprisingly, as the\nnovelty factor. They found that this\nfactor decays rapidly approximately\ntwo hours after the story is first shown\non the front page, declining to less than\n0.03 after three hours as promotion of\nthe story decreases.\nThe researchers propose that the decay time of 2 hours is linked to some\nnatural in-built attention span of a\nlarge population. If so, these findings\ncould be useful to advertisers who rely\non the spread of information within\na large population, and along varying\ntime scales.\nOthers researchers point out that the\ntypes of stories with high ratings tend\nto be those that have little impact on\nsociety but just provide something to\nrelate to and be intrigued. For example,\nstories on Paris Hilton going to jail for\ndrink driving offences or Amy Winehouse has going to rehab.\nAt the time of writing the top three\ndigged stories of the American website\nfrom the past 24 hours include \u201cFashion tips for women from a guy who\nknows dick about fashion,\u201d \u201c5 scientific\nreasons a Zombie Apocalypse could actually happen,\u201d and \u201cMarijuana is not a\ndrug, it\u2019s a leaf, says Schwarzenegger.\u201d\nYou might as well check them out\nnow; they\u2019ll be gone in a few hours.\nSuch is the rise and fall of news\nstories.\nNeophiles\u2019 attention span gauged\nIf you\u2019re one, you\u2019ll be moving on to a new story soon.

The evening progressed with the usual mix of policy\nand report rubber-stamping until the\nfinal moments when the meeting finished in unexpectedly dramatic fashion\nas the Graduate Student\u2019s Association\n(GSA) Chair, Jon Matthews, resigned\nand subsequently exited the building.\nMr Matthews had to produce a revised report to Council because the paper he submitted earlier in the month\nwas rejected. The general feeling was\nthat Mr Matthews\u2019 original report\ndidn\u2019t justify the \u00a32000 honorarium\npayment he was given for being GSA\nChair, hence the need for a rewrite.\nThe first Councillor to voice his\nopinion on Monday night about Mr\nMatthews\u2019 latest report was ICSMSU\nPresident, Tim Wills, who took objection to his work with graduate-medical\nstudents. As the discussion continued\nmore and more people began to raise\nquestions, giving an indication that Mr\nMatthews\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be getting off quite\nso lightly this evening.\nAfter an initial round of voting, four\npeople voted for the report with another four voting against, whilst the\nremaining Councillors abstained. Courageously, Mr Matthews called for a recount of the vote, probably hoping that\nthe votes would fall in his favour, however it was to be his undoing; Council\nvoted 6-5 to reject his report (with\nover 10 abstentions). The result meant\nthat Council would automatically have\nto vote on whether to censure Mr Matthews or not; a censure is effectively an\nofficial slap on the wrist or a way of say-ing: \u201cyou\u2019ve been a naughty person.\u201d\nHowever, before the Councillors\neven had a chance to wave their voting cards in the air, Mr Matthews stood\ntall announcing his resignation, before\nwalking out of the Union Dining Hall\nleaving the GSA committee with precisely zero members.\nRather ironically, Mr Matthews\u2019\nwas involved in a successfully passed\ncensure motion in February this year,\nwhen he instigated disciplinary action\nagainst the former Deputy President\n(Graduate Students), Shama Rahman.\nBy taking on the role of GSA Chair\nover the summer, Mr Matthews effectively took over from Ms Rahman\nas the figurehead for postgraduate\nrepresentation, since the DPGS position was scrapped at the end of the last\nacademic year. At the time, the censure\npassed against Ms Rahman was the\nfirst in twenty years, but the boot was\non the other foot at this week\u2019s Council and Mr Matthews was firmly on the\nreceiving end.\nCritics believe that Mr Matthews\ncould have done much more to help the\nGSA\u2019s cause over the summer. The ex-Deputy President has been condemned\nfor the lack of a GSA stall at Freshers\u2019\nFair, no postgraduate parties or events\nand a seemingly non-existent push to\nget people to stand for the empty positions on the GSA committee during\nthe recent elections period. Mr Matthews has reiterated that he has found\nit difficult being the only member of\nthe GSA, having to be the point of contact for postgraduates all by himself.\nHis reasoning for not having a Freshers\u2019 Fair stall is more dubious however.\nHe stated in his report that he felt it\nwould be better for postgraduates \u201cto\nspend the day looking at the clubs the\nUnion has to offer.\u201d\nAlso brought into question recently\nwas the manner in which Mr Matthews\nreceived the \u00a32000 honorarium pay-ment. It\u2019s not known how exactly the\nmoney was awarded to the GSA Chair\nand the Union has repeatedly asked for\nan audit trail to be provided, but Mr\nCollege\ngetting set for\nGreen Roof\nEarlier during Monday\u2019s Council (be-fore the dramatics discussed in the story to the left), a policy was tabled and\nsuccessfully passed detailing the plans\nfor a new Green Roof to be built on one\nof the College\u2019s rooftops.\nReaders can rest assured that the\nGreen Roof isn\u2019t simply an aesthetic\naccompaniment to the pink Bessemer\nBuilding. Instead a Green Roof is in\nactual fact a trendier name for an environmentally friendly garden rooftop.\nThe idea was brought to Council by\nthe RAG Chair Karandeep Dhanoa\nwho sought the Union\u2019s backing. Various staff members on campus have\nalready taken a keen interest in the\nGreen Roof project and College has\nsaid it will foot the bill.\nIf all goes well and the final proposals get the go ahead, the Green Roof\nshould have a number of functions.\nHopefully it will act as a social space\nfor students making up for the other\ngreen areas that are being replaced\nby redevelopment projects; fingers\ncrossed that College\u2019s army of marquees doesn\u2019t invade the rooftop too.\nFurthermore, less heat will be lost from\nthe roof, runoff water will be recycled\nand it will have a longer life span than\nconventional flat roofs.\nInterestingly, students will be responsible for designing the Green Roof\nas part of their coursework. Biologists\nwill be required to design the ecosys-tem, Mechanical Engineers will be\ntasked with producing a watering system and Civil Engineers will need to\nensure the roof doesn\u2019t cave in.\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nMatthews has claimed to be otherwise\noccupied and unable to provide the\nnecessary details. Although Mr Matthews was rather publicly mauled on\nMonday night, his lack of communication with the Union on this matter\ndidn\u2019t help his case.\nThe incident on Monday night has\nhighlighted problems beyond Mr Matthews\u2019 resignation though. Firstly, why\ndid so many of the Councillors abstain\nfrom voting? Was it for personal rea-sons, having to work with or attend\nCollege with someone they wanted\ncensured? Or did the Councillors not\nfully understand the situation? Was inexperience the cause?\nSecondly, and of more immediate concern: where does the GSA go\nfrom here? The current GSA election\nhas been suspended, although only\none person was running for any of the\npositions anyway. At the moment, the\nUnion Presidents are taking on the duties performed by the GSA until it can\nestablish an interim board. Yet more\nGSA elections will have to be held and\nit will be at least a month, if not longer\nbefore the committee is reformed. This\nis all assuming postgraduates want to\nget involved with reviving the GSA an-yway. Felix has approached a number\nof postgraduates asking them for comment in the light of Monday\u2019s events\nand the response has mainly been:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the GSA?\u201d Or, \u201cI don\u2019t really\ncare.\u201d\nThe Union is going to have to work\nhard if it wants to bring back the GSA\nproperly, plus it\u2019s going to need to put\nin even more effort if it wants to improve the association\u2019s currently dismal profile. The election for the next\ncommittee will be the fourth within\na year and the Union will need to put\ntogether a strong campaign to elect\nsomeone for the cursed position of\npostgraduate student representative.\nThe GSA needs a motivated leader and\nthe Union needs to work closely with\nthat person whilst ensuring that an effective permanent member of staff is\nemployed to work alongside the part-time Chair.\nThe Union Dining Hall was the stage for Monday night\u2019s dramatics\n\n"

First receiving the coveted Pritzker prize (the architectural\nequivalent of an Academy Award) and\nnow bestowed with her own gleaming exhibition at the Design Museum,\nthese highs are in contrast to the lows\nshe has sustained throughout her career \u2013 most notably the populist snub\nto her winning design for the Cardiff\nOpera House. One inevitably asks why\nopinion polarises when it comes to the\ncharismatic Hadid.\nBorn in Baghdad in 1950, Hadid received her degree in mathematics from\nthe American University of Beirut before reaching these blessed shores to\nstudy at the prestigious Architectural\nAssociation, graduating to work with\nthe revered Rem Koolhaas at the Office\nof Metropolitan Architecture (OMA)\nin Rotterdam, and establishing her\nown London practice in 1980.\nKnown for her inspiring and breathtaking visions of urban spaces, most\nnotably the prizewinning Peak in Hong\nKong early in her career, she was equally known for being unable to transfer\nmost of these to tangible structures.\nWings clipped by physical, structural\nor financial limitations, Hadid entered\nthe 21st century with only one notable\nstructure to her name and with countless plans and drawings, hence the derogatory description of her as primarily a \u201cpaper architect\u201d.\nYet despite this, she has managed\nto remain one of the most influential and inspiring figures in her field,\nwith a jaggedly angular yet curvaceous style as distinctive as any of her\ncontemporaries.\nSomehow the floodgates opened and\nher office in Clerkenwell is now overwhelmed with activity as she enters a\nnew phase of her career with a plethora\nof buildings in progress \u2013 a new opera\nhouse in Guangzhou, the extraterrestrial Performing Arts Centre in Abu\nDhabi and The Opus, an incredibly\nambitious office tower in Dubai that\nwill appear to hover over the ground.\nMore close to home is the new\nAquatics Centre for the Olympics,\ncontroversially running way over its already immodest \u00a375 million budget.\nThese are represented immaculately\nin an exhibition that spans two hushed\nrooms on the Shad Thames. The first\nrepresents the early phase of her ca-reer, with early sketches of The Peak\nand her initial brief and thoughts \u2013\n\u201cthe architecture appears like a knife\ncutting through butter devastating all\nthe traditional principles and establishing new ones. Defying nature but\nnot destroying it.\u201d\nThough clearly in the mindset of an\nartiste-cum-visionary at times, Hadid\nbacks it up with typical attention to de-tail; her sprawling yet concise plans for\nItaly\u2019s National Museum of Contemporary Art in Rome and the Phaeno\nThe BMW building in Leipzig is one of many to possess Hadid\u2019s striking angular style\nThe interior of the first room is perhaps definitive of \u201csleek\u201d\nZahid\u2019s Dancing Towers\nScience Centre are there for anyone to\nperuse at their leisure.\nA wall is taken up by her paintings,\nscale drawings and sketches of The\nPeak and her visions for urban redevelopments \u2013 her representations of city\ncentres and even relatively straightforward structures such as office blocks\nare turned on their head warp across\nthe canvas in a manner nothing short\nof mind-blowing.\nIncorporated too, are hitherto little known plans for developments for\nLondon such as the intriguing \u201cLeicester Square\u201d project in 1990, for an\nexhibition exploring London\u2019s public realm. A new space was proposed\napproximately the size of the current\nLeicester Square but semi-submerged\nbelow its surface, rather like a sunken\nspace. All development would be inverted and sunk into the ground, slicing subterranean \u201cskyscrapers\u201d into\nthe earth.\nOn a vast wall are projections of dig-itally-rendered three-dimensional images of concepts and completed works.\nThe Cardiff Opera House scale model\nis here too, unrepentantly displayed or\nperhaps a reminder of the architect\u2019s\nchequered past before the turn of the\ncentury.\nSpeaking of which, things picked up\nbetween then and now \u2013 three major\nworks displayed include the brooding\nand angular BMW Central Building\nin Leipzig and the Rosenthal Center\nfor Contemporary Art in Cincinnati,\nan excitingly jarring yet fittingly congruent addition to the city\u2019s urban regeneration scheme and a counterpoint\nto Koolhaas\u2019s similarly proportioned\nSeattle Public Library.\nThe whitewashed second room\ndisplays Hadid\u2019s works-in-progress\nincluding the aforementioned, but\nalso a re-imagining of the traditional\nskyscraper, moving away from single,\nisolated towers to almost contorted,\nhelix-like forms.\nLike other architects, Hadid has\nbeen lured into dabbling with small\nscale design by the prospect of a short\ntime-frame and working on a 1:1 scale.\nThough hardly miniature buildings,\nordinary household items can offer the\nopportunity to explore an idea or an\narchitectural form.\nPresented are regular items such as\nshelves that looks like something out\nof Alien, tea and coffee pots that are\nmore military issue than Homebase,\nand the sleekest, sexiest tables and\nchairs. Though mundane and humble\nin function, calling this homewares\nwould be like calling an F1 car a daily\ncommute.\nSpeaking of commutes, included is\na low point in the exhibition \u2013 a design for a lightweight car that, though\nprogressive and brave, looks pretty\ninsipid; more Pikachu than Gordon\nMurray. Also included is the obligatory handbag which, though taken out\nof context, also fell somewhat short of\nthe mark.\nCapturing the diversity and essence\nof Hadid\u2019s work never seemed a simple prospect, but the curators have\nsucceeded admirably in emphasising\nHadid\u2019s creative strengths even if her\ncurrent body of completed work is not\ncomparable to other architects held in\nthe same esteem. With the concurrent\nMatthew Williamson exhibition running at the same space, a trip down to\nthe Shad Thames seems due.\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 2 November 2007 felix\nScience\nScientists at the Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC), an independent research center in Belgium,\nhave developed a new health sensor,\nwhich runs off electricity generated by\nthe temperature difference between\nthe skin of the forehead and air.\nThis thermoelectric powered electroencephalogram (EEG), which monitors brain-waves, straps to the head\nand wirelessly transmits information\non the electrical activity of the brain\nto a personal computer.\nDespite the EEG\u2019s thermoelectric\ngenerator only having a small theoretical efficiency, the thermal gradient present between the skin of the\nforehead and air at room temperature\nprovides more than enough power to\nrun the EEG. How the generator obtains this power is central to its use in\ndevices such as this one.\nIn one sense, thermoelectric generators are nothing new, having been\nused for many years in various devices\nfrom refrigerators to spacecraft. However, IMEC\u2019s EEG is a good example\nof their more recent application to\nmedical devices, where they are used\nto convert waste heat from the body\ninto electricity, to power sophisticated\nsensors for gathering sensitive data on\nhuman health.\nIMEC began research into thermo-electrically powered health sensors in\n2003. One of its goals was to eliminate\nthe need for batteries in medical devices worn on the human body. Wearable thermoelectric generators would\nalso provide the autonomy afforded\nby batteries, but with an unlimited\nlifetime.\nHowever, there are physical obstacles to overcome when designing this\ntype of sensor, and to understand these\nit helps to know how a thermoelectric\ngenerator works.\nThe generator basically consists of\nthousands of thermocouple junctions\nmade of two dissimilar semiconductor\nmaterials, such as bismuth-telluride\nor silicon-germanium. When thermocouples are exposed to temperature\ngradients, they produce an electric\ncurrent, through a process known as\nthe thermoelectric effect. Thermopiles, formed by connecting thermocouples in series, are sandwiched together between \u2018hot\u2019 and \u2018cold\u2019 ceramic\nplates, the whole sandwich forming a\nthermoelectric generator.\nOne of the biggest obstacles in\nproducing thermoelectricity lies in\nmatching the varying thermal energy\nresistance of the generator with the air\ntemperature of its environment. To\naccomplish this, the thermoelectric\ngenerator must be designed to correspond with an adequate air tempera-ture, such as the indoor temperature\nof an office or hospital. The forehead\nis and ideal location for the thermo-electric generator because it has a low\nthermal resistance and provides heat\nat a constant rate resulting in a decent\nthermoelectric output \u2013 up to 25 mW/\ncm2\n. In order to increase the thermal\ndifference between the generator and\nthe air, and hence the electrical out-put, the hot and cold thermocouple\njunctions are isolated .\nCurrently, researchers at IMEC are\nlooking to lower the power consumption of the EEG sensor even further,\nand are designing a semiconductor\nprocess for manufacturing thermo-piles at a lower production cost. Thermoelectric-powered health sensors\nsuch as the EEG, could play a vital role\nin the medical industry. But it doesn\u2019t\nhave to end there. After all, if one\ncould power an EEG by generating\nthermoelectricity utilizing heat from\nthe forehead, why not power your cell\nphone or iPod from the heat of other\nparts of the human body or even the\nsun?\nFever\u2019d electroencephalogram on your brow\nWhat a brainwave! Health sensor demonstrates a novel method to generate energy, based on body heat\nBrett Cherry\n\u201cWhy not charge\nyour cell phone\nfrom the heat\nof the human\nbody?\u201d\nInspired, the editor tries to charge his mobile using his overheated\nbrain.

    "content": "6 felix Friday 2 November 2007\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Comment\nComment\nThe world is a reflection of its religion\nI\nhave, on the desk next to me, six\ncopies of a book called \u201cGOD \u2013\nMan\u2019s Loving Enemy\u201d by a man\nnamed Adam Bolton. The manner in which I came to own these\ncopies is, I promise you, entirely true.\nFourteen months ago, I signed up to\na self-publishing website to read about\na friend\u2019s book. Then I didn\u2019t go back\nto the website ever again. About a year\nago now, they sent me a large box, with\na letter in that congratulated me for\npublishing my first book \u2013 something\nthat I, also, was happy about, having\nnot actually written one.\nIt turned out that this was actually\nsome other poor sod\u2019s first book, and\nseeing as my attempts to return the\nbooks to the publisher were met with\nan email promising a second set, I decided to keep them.\nOf course, at that point I assumed\nthey were actually readable. My mis-take. The subtitle of the book is, \u201cThe\nWorld Is A Reflection Of Its Religion.\nReligion, In Turn, Is A Reflection Of\nThe God It Worships\u201d. In short, the\nbook is written by a believer in God,\nand details the myriad ways that the\ncreator of existence is shit at his job. It\u2019s\nRichard Dawkins, crossed with Martin\nLuther. It\u2019s out of its mind.\nNot to worry though, as I thought\nFelix Arts might like to take a look and\nthey\u2019ve informed me you fine people\nwill soon be able to get your hands on\nthe copy I\u2019ve given them. Please try to\ncontain your excitement and read on,\nbecause the book represents such a\nbizarre standpoint that I may actually\nbe able to contain my resentment for\nmankind as a whole in order to lay into\nMr. Bolton a little more sharply.\nYou see, Bolton\u2019s underlying argument is this \u2013 Organised Religion\nis brainwashing the people, and we\nshould all wake up to the idea that-God is God, fallible but ultimately In\nCharge, and that people like the Pope\njust want your money. Your money,\nand our nation\u2019s children. And pup-pies, probably, to kill and feast upon.\nAnyway, in between LARGE SECTIONS IN BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS\nand general rambling, Bolton doesn\u2019t\never grasp the idea that Religion is\nmore useful than simply a means of\noppession. Or even faith provision.\nReligion dupes people into worshipping itself, it\u2019s true. So does television,\nand the Felix Editor. The thing Religion has that the others don\u2019t, is that it\ndupes people well. Really well. In fact,\nforget governments and corporations,\nReligion still remains the biggest social\nglue on the planet. Yes, this is going\nwhere you think it\u2019s going.\nI don\u2019t know how many of you are\nreligious, or who are religious but pretending not to be so you can get in the\npants of that existentialist you see at\nthe back of Friday afternoon lectures,\nand I don\u2019t really care. Maybe you considered your faith carefully enough to\nchooseityourself.Morelikely,youwere\ncoaxed into it by someone else \u2013 just\nlike others were coaxed into atheism.\nAnd maybe, yes, you give money every\nyear that ends up funding your local\nbishop\u2019s supping on golden retriever\nbabies. But at the end of the day, you\nfeel like you\u2019re part of something. And\nirregardless of The Big Guy\u2019s actual ex-istence, you are part of something.\nIn fact, in an age where we can\u2019t even\ngroup together for long enough to turn\noff televisions that we\u2019re not watching,\nReligion is something of a unique institution in the world, where people get\ntogether to genuinely act as a group.\nSure, you might think they\u2019re doing\nit out of self-interest, or that it\u2019s akin\nto brainwashing, or that, occasion-ally, what they do as a group involves\nmurdering large numbers of people.\nTouch\u00e9. But that sort of thing happens\nwhether you\u2019ve got a story about an old\nguy in a toga sitting on a cloud or not.\nWhat happens far less when you\ndon\u2019t have the old guy, is philanthropy,\nselflessness and Genuine Good Stuff.\nI\u2019m not religious, and I like to think\nthat between shouting at you and\nA. Geek\n\u201c\nReligion\ndupes people\ninto worshipping\nitself. So does\ntelevision\nand the Felix\nEditor\n\u201d This week in England... Issue 002\nThe\nRingmaster\nDoes Sanchez Ring A Bell?\nIf there were any time we required\nevidence to suggest that our wonderful government either cannot count\nor was terribly distracted with writing\ninspirational forget-the-party\u2019s-values\nspeeches, it would have to be now. After all, it only takes so long for someone to be sitting at their desk and finally concede... \u201dI\u2019ll leave the last stack for\ntomorrow\u201d before binning the rest of\nthe visa applications and accidentally\nfalling 300,000 heads short. Whoopsies! England has to take a firm stand\nagainst this clearly evil invasion that\nhas befallen the country; ignore the\nfact that you\u2019re all more or less Spanish\nin the first place (although these days, I\nmust say, that Spanish lot seem to have\nfared somewhat better a-swimming\nin the gene pool...) and that without\nyour so despised call centres the cost\nof your BT landline will want to make\nyou swallow your own face, this has to\nbe put at an end!\nThis is a rallying call to all the Imperial College aspiring plumbers, kebab\nshop owners, telemarketers, mobile\nphone salespeople and fruit vendors\nacross all departments \u2013 without\neveryone\u2019s support, the government\nwould look rather silly. And let\u2019s be\nhonest: we don\u2019t want them taking our\nmost valuable jobs now, do we?\nNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I have my\nplush office in Fleet Street and my 50\nmillion pound bonus this year to look\nforward to.\nWho\u2019s This Bloody Bloke anyway?\nI\u2019m unsure as to how many letters of\nholy enlightenment our esteemed editor has received after my teachings in\nthe second previous issue, but I have\nyet another revelation to share with\nyou inspired lot \u2013 I have chosen to walk\namongst you. Because cameras tend to\nstop working whenever a photo of my\nface is taken (you should see what I can\ndo to polaroids) I shall, over the coming months, attempt to show you some\nbits and bobs of the person whose\nworldly form I have decided to take.\nTo make things even more interesting,\nthe first person who does not directly\nknow my worldly alias who guesses\ncorrectly to our esteetmed editor, will\nwin an as-of-yet undetermined prize.\nDetails to follow in my next issue.\nEngland Does It Best...\nOnce again, England has not failed to\nimpress. You would be excused, prior\nto the 2002 World Cup, if you believed\nthe hype that we weren\u2019t just going to\nsweep the rest of the world under a\nrug, but that Wayne Rooney himself\nwill be biting the fingers off any goalkeeper that dares keep a football out of\nthe net touched by his supple foot.\nCome the cricket world cup, and oh\ndear oh dear oh dear \u2013 a rallying call\nagainst the Aussies was in order, of\ncourse, and it would have been great\nto watch had we ever gotten that far.\nIt seems like we were beginning to\nlearn a lesson, but that was before the\nWorld Cup Final in the rugby, and the\nFormula One world championship\nshowdown in Brazil. In one weekend,\nthe worst, most gutting, and horrific\nbattle cries I have heard in my life were\nechoing throughout the desperate face\nof England. Despite the fact that Perry\nMontgomery is effectively a Jonny\nWilkinson v3.0. Despite the fact that\nnobody really expects Hamilton to win\nshouting at Mr. Bolton that I\u2019m a pretty\namiable person. But I wouldn\u2019t say everyone was like that. And nor would I\nsay that I could organise anything good\non a very large scale. My advice would\nbe this \u2013 if you\u2019re happy as you are,\ndon\u2019t change it. Atheism might look\ncrisp, modern and rational, but it\u2019s unlikely to organise anything more helpful than Marxism for many decades to\ncome.\nthe title in his rookie season (although\nall credit to him, how close can you\nget!).\nEngland has done what it does best,\nand, well, I\u2019m proud of her.

It\u2019s no Monster\nSurfing the New Wave of Romanian Cinema\nT\nhe 2007 Palme D\u2019Or winner comes from Romania.\nIt\u2019s probably not a terribly\nexciting fact, as film buffs\nwill have been aware of it\nfor months and the more lay film fans\nwon\u2019t really care too much about it.\nBut in its home country, 4 Months, 3\nWeeks, 2 Days left many people in a\nstate of bedazzlement \u2013 and a pleasant\none, if I may say so.\nIt seemed like something peculiar\nmight happen at the prize ceremony\never since Cristian Mungiu\u2019s film was\nfirst screened at the beginning of the\nfestival. The buzz was really good, but\nmost would have thought it far-fetched\nto actually put money on it. By the\ntime the big night had had its turn and\nMungiu his award, the whole Romanian media was stunned by the film\u2019s\nsuccess. There was finally a reason\nto awake from the grave of perennial\nmoral deprecation in order to actually\nwrite and talk about something worthy\non its own behalf.\n4, 3, 2 is the only Romanian film to\nhave won the Golden Palm, but in context it is the pinnacle of a film scene\nthat has been totally revived in the last\nfive years - and the prestigious French\nfestival of cinema was one of the first\nto notice. Cannes had taken a liking\nto Romanian movies ever since The\nDeath of Mr. Lazarescu (d. Cristi Puiu)\nreceived the top prize in the Un Certain Regard category in 2005. It was\nthen followed by 2006\u2019s wins of Doroteea Petre (Un Certain Regard \u2013 best\nactress) and Porumboiu\u2019s 12:08 East of\nBucharest (Golden Camera and Label\nEuropa Cinemas prizes) as well as both\nMungiu\u2019s and Cristian Nemescu\u2019s wins\nin 2007 - the latter, sadly deceased,\nwon in the Un Certain Regard section\nwith California Dreamin\u2019 (Unfinished).\nThese awards come to confirm not\nonly a certain penchant for anguishing realism the \u201cFrench\u201d juries tend to\nhave, but also the high calibre production values of this new, young generation of filmmakers, born and bred in\nthe old communist block.\nCristian Mungiu, 39 years old, was\nat his second feature film, after 2002\u2019s\nWest (in its Romanian title Occident),\nan excellent comedic take on contemporary Romania. However, the Palme\nD\u2019Or winner is as far away from comedy as they get.\nThe story of two student girls (Gabita\nand Otilia), one of whom is pregnant,\ntakes place in the late eighties, when\nabortions were considered illegal, and\nit portrays in a vivid and blunt fashion\nthe ordeal through which many women\nhad to go through between 1966 and\n1989 (actually, Ceausescu\u2019s decision to\ninterdict abortions turned against him\nat the revolution, as most of the people\nwho took a stand for freedom in it were\npart of the generations born immediately after \u201966). That about summarizes the idea that lies behind the film \u2013\nthe first in a series planned by Mungiu\nabout life in communist Romania - but\nit is the raw performances of the lead\nactresses and harsh truths that it offers\nwhich stick to you once it\u2019s finished.\nGabita is played by Laura Vasiluiu,\nwhile the part of Otilia is taken up\nby Anamaria Marinca, winner of the\nBAFTA best actress award in 2005 for\nher performance in the Channel 4 production Sex Traffic. Personally, I think\nthere is really little to say in a review\nabout the film, because it\u2019s just such a\ntremendous experience \u2013 even if not a\njoyful one.\nBeyond the heaps of praise that it gar-nered, the fact is that 4, 3, 2 managed\nto fill the dusty cinemas of Romania\nwith eager and expectant viewers, an\nimpresseive feat given the desolation\nthat normally fills the movie theatres.\nMoreover, because many cities didn\u2019t\nhave any running cinemas left, Mungiu and his crew went around with the\nfilm and projected it for anyone who\nwas interested in watching it.\nIn the 15 cities it stopped and 3,200\nkilometres it travelled, the 4 Months, 3\nWeeks, 2 Days Caravan afforded 18,000\npeople the chance of seeing what is\nwidely considered the best Romanian\nfilm of the decade. It surely wasn\u2019t as\nfancy as the 19th October premiere at\nThe Times BFI 51st London Film Festival, but it meant a lot for many people.\nPerhaps it\u2019s just one of the weird\nparadoxes of our contemporary, me-dia-driven society that people came to\nfill Romanian cinemas for a film that\nis such an opposite of a crowd pleaser\n\u2013 and maybe there\u2019s something to be\nlearned from this which could benefit\nother good films that are often overlooked because of the inconvenient\nthemes they treat.\nWhichever the merits of Cristian\nMungiu\u2019s movie may be, it has one that\noutranks them all: it made a film become something more to many of the\npeople it was about. And hopefully, it\nremains just one of the many significant tales of cinema that are to come.\nStefan Carpanu explores the latest force in world cinema, led by Cannes champ 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days\nAn apple a day keeps the bills away\nMichael Moore reloads his cannon against the problems of healthcare in those good ol\u2019 United States\nMichael Moore, the loved and loathed\nwalking soap box returns with a look at\nthe healthcare of his good old United\nStates of America. Not exactly a fan of\nthe administration, Moore tones down\nhis aggressive attitude from Fahrenheit\n9/11 but makes sure where he lays the\nblame for the pitiable state of his country\u2019s health service, but does so much\nmore compellingly than his last effort,\nthe result oscillating between a hilarious and heart wrenching tale of the\nfailings of a Government to protect its\npeople.\nRegardlessofmypoliticalallegiances,\nI found Fahrenheit to be a horrendous\ndocumentary. Having not seen Bowling for Columbine, I felt I was watching the American Jim Royle chasing\nUS senators down a street with ridiculously sensationalist techniques and\nwas incapable of comprehending the\nsupport this man had gathered across\nhis country and the world.\nSeemingly I was not alone in this,\nand perhaps someone back at base\ncamp told him to tone it down slightly,\nbecause in Sicko, the OTT techniques\ntake a backseat (for the most part) and\nthe problem at hand is permitted centre stage.\nTo me, this doesn\u2019t seem to be a\npoint worth arguing on. Unlike the debate over Iraq, free healthcare is some-Alex Casey\nthing that we as a country may take for\ngranted. Now imagine if that weren\u2019t\nthe case and you had to pay for health\ninsurance, incurring costs every time\nyou wanted to go to your GP and living\nlife in fear that you may get anything\nmore serious than a cough. That\u2019s the\npicture Moore paints here, and it can\nmake for deeply upsetting viewing at\ntimes.\nI was close to leaving within the first\nfew minutes of this. Gore in films\ndoesn\u2019t bother me, although I\u2019m not\na fan of it just for the sake of it. Pain\nhowever, normally in documentary, is\nanother story completely and the distinction between what a good make up\ndepartment can do and the suffering\nof a real person can put me off a film\ninstantly.\nWatching a man stitch up a gash in\nhis own leg because he didn\u2019t want to\npay for help placed him squarely in the\nlatter category but I figured I\u2019d stay\npast the credits. Let it be known that\nit is worth doing so, because Moore\nquickly balances such horrifying images and stories with his Powerpoint\nstyle of graphics and a few well aimed\nswipes at retarded buffoon George\nDubya. The laughs may seem pretty\ncheap sometimes, but they\u2019re hearty\naudience pleasers. This screening had\nfrequent laugh-out-loud moments\n(even if it were just at those retro pictures of Mrs Clinton) and a round of\napplause to close.\nAs for factual accuracy, I\u2019m not one to\ncomment. The shock of his points was\nslightly dulled when he began a tour of\nthe world seeing \u201csocialist healthcare\u201d\nin operation in the likes of France and\nthe UK where everyone gets, gulp, free\nSicko \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Michael Moore\nWriter: Michael Moore\nCast: Michael Moore\nSo, you mean it\u2019s really free? Really? No, I mean seriously here\nhealthcare. At this point his continued\ngasping at the thought of not being\ncharged on entering a hospital does get\nmore than slightly tedious and the NHS\nbeing held up as a model system seems\nto fly in the face of what our country\u2019s\nmedia tells us, although we should admit to ourselves we don\u2019t have it that\nbad. Just keep your voice down about\nMRSA\u2026\nSicko succeeds as a persuasion piece\non a level that Fahrenheit didn\u2019t, and\nwhile I would rather not continue\ncomparing them, Moore\u2019s unique style\nmakes it impossible to hold them up\nindividually. His comedy stylings are\nobviously going to make this appeal\nto a much wider demographic than\nthe stuffy professionalism of a Panorama special so he\u2019s easy to dismiss as\na perpetrator of unsubstantiated shock\ntactics, yet there\u2019s something in his\npresentation here that strikes a chord.\nThat would be the chord of injustice\nmost probably, and with any luck that\nmight be a key note for the next US\nadministration.\n\n"

I bought the\nsoundtrack, I watched the\nmovie. Hell \u2013 I even knitted the scarf. Oh, she\u2019ll write\nan \u201cI loved every single minute of this\nshow\u201d review you\u2019re thinking. Well\nsorry, but I meant the original version.\nRent was one of the first Broadway musicals I discovered back when I was doing my GCSEs (it was only 3 or 4 years\nago) and so it was a little precious to\nme; I didn\u2019t really want to see anyone\nscrew it up. So I was a bit apprehensive in going to see Rent Remixed, the\n\u201cnew\u201d version by William Baker, creative director to Kylie Minogue.\nBut first, a quick history lesson. Rent\nfirst opened in 1996, based on the life\nof its author Jonathan Larson, whose\nfriends around him were living hard\nlives and dying of AIDS. Ironically, he\ndied the night before the opening of a\nheart aneurysm (and not AIDS) and\ndid not live to see his show win the\nTony Award (like an Oscar for theatre)\nand the Pulitzer for theatre.\nRent came to London for a while,\nbut didn\u2019t do too well, perhaps because\nthey cast Adam Ricketts (the guy with\nthe 6 pack off Coronation Street) and\nCaprice. The film came out in 2005\nstarring the original Broadway cast and\nwas panned for them being too old.\nWhich brings us to \u201cRent Remixed\u201d.\nWithout giving too much of the story\naway, Rent looks at a group of 8 friends\nin New York and a year in their lives\nseen through the eyes of Mark, a film-maker. Okay, it\u2019s not that simple.\nThere\u2019s a drug addict exotic dancer,\nan ex-junkie recluse, two gay guys,\ntwo lesbians and half of them are HIV\npositive. It is originally based on Puccini\u2019s La Boheme, and is updated for\nthe MTV generation. For example,\nRodolfo the poet becomes Roger the\nsongwriter, and Schaunard the musician became Angel Dumott Schunard,\nthe drag queen drumming busker.\nThe show is billed as the first to offer a general admission price, which is\ngreat for us students, especially as they\nknock off another \u00a310, making it a bargain \u00a320!\nThe first thing that hits you as you\nenter the theatre is the a vastness of\nwhite. The set is basic but effective.\nMost of the action takes place on a\nwhite square with simple props (a\nchair, a table, a funky chaise lounge).\nAbove is a walkway lined with a digital\ndisplay, used most effectively to display\nthe names of famous people who have\ndied of AIDS.\nThe show starts with a new prologue\nwhich introduces the main musical themes of the score and the main\nthemes of the show; the idea of questioning how your life will change when\nhit with a terminal illness, how you\nshould spend the time you have left\nto the full and to measure your life in\nlove. The themes are carried through\nthe show by Larson\u2019s powerful lyrics\nand the actions of his characters.\nWhilst the film was set firmly in\n1989/1990, the play could be set any-time, which adds to the idea that AIDS\nis still as big an issue today as it was\nin the 80s. The location on the other\nhand, is set firmly in New York City,\nwhich brings us to the first negative\npoint of this version of \u201cRent\u201d. Baker\nwanted to make the piece timeless\nand placeless \u2013 a universal show, but\nto make this happen he would have\nhad to remove many of the lyrics and\ndialogue. Unfortunately, half the cast\nseem to have forgotten this, and so\nMark is well spoken and slightly Welsh\n(this kind of fits with the character, except I don\u2019t know many Welsh Jews)\nand Angel is a slightly gruff Cockney\n(which really didn\u2019t fit as Angel has\nalways been the happiest and most effeminate character).\nOf course, when they start singing,\nmost reverted back to American. So\nwith every other problem in the show,\ninstead of fixing it, Baker just adds extra\ndialogue to gloss over it, so Angel and\nMimi now came over from London.\nThe songs themselves are what make\nthe show. They push the storyline, they\nplay with your feelings and take you on\na roller coaster ride of emotions over\nthe 2-ish hours.\nThe best word to describe Rent\nRemixed would be inconsistent. There\nare some amazing scenes that are\nmuch better than in the original \u2013 look\nout for the Tango Maureen and What\nYou Own \u2013 but some songs, in an attempt to \u201cfunk up\u201d the score, have been\nreduced to Kylie Minogue backing\ntracks. Rent was originally billed in the\nnineties as a Rock Opera for the MTV\ngeneration. Now in the Myspace gen-eration, it has been transformed into\na Pop Opera \u2013 yet surely pop had its\nheyday in the nineties?\nThe cast have also been sexed up\nalong with (supposedly) the music.\nThere\u2019s lots of pouting and leather, and\nthe cast definitely aren\u2019t ugly! There\nwere some great standout performances too.\nYes, Denise Van Outen is in it. Yes,\nshe is good and can definitely sing and\nyes, that is the main reason why most\npeople will go see Rent Remixed. I\nfound that her main song, a performance art protest, actually took the audience away from the story leading you\ninto the \u201cDenise Van Outen Show\u201d.\nWe saw the understudy for Joanne,\nCJ Johnson, and I thought she had an\nexcellent voice, especially singing material originally written for a gospel-syle belter. Unfortunately both Joanne\nand Maureen are both blonde, which\nmade them look more like twins than\nlovers.\nAt first I was put off by Mark (Oliver\nThornton)\u2019s very British accent, but it\ngrew on me and I did begin to feel for\nMark and the loneliness he experiences\nthrough the show. Leon Lopez and Jay\nWebb made the relationship of Angel\nand Collins realistic and sweet, both\nwith different but brilliant voices.\nBut most of my praise is for Luke\nEvans. The man has an amazing voice\n\u2013 just the right combination of booming musical theatre and rock timbre.\nHe also grasped the concept of his\ncharacter and understood his situation\nso well, making me feel for Roger, a\ncharacter I never really liked before.\nSo will Rent Remixed last? I\u2019m not\nsure; I hope so, perhaps with some\nchanges. Do I want you to go see it?\nYes! It\u2019s a powerful show (especially act\ntwo) if you look beyond the \u201cHey, we\u2019re\nsuddenly all dancing and singing\u201d as-pect, and it carries a strong message\nthat is still relevant today. Maybe I\ndidn\u2019t feel for the characters as much\nas I felt I could if they had been played\ndifferently, but I still laughed and cried\n(luckily theatres are dark).\nPlus, although it may not be original\nnow, it\u2019s score and book are definitely\nmore original than the jukebox musicals on at the moment. So take your\nnext step on the road to musical theatre appreciation and go and see Rent\nRemixed!\nRent Remixed tackles tough issues like terminal illness, living life to the full. And bro love\nDenise Van Outen returns to the stage in this supremely hip, not camp-at-all uber remix of the classic musical Rent. Doesn\u2019t she look pretty?\n\n"

The Swedes,\npulling rank having invented the sport,\nrequired that the canoes be sea worthy\nwhilst the Lithuanians and Paraguayans, entering the championships for\nthe first time had assumed the canoes\nwere simply aesthetic. Incidentally, the\nMexicans were disqualified outright\nfor using \u2018canoes\u2019 a mere two feet in\nlength, despite demonstrating their\nskills with full size canoes at the previous WCJC. Thus began the standardisation of the juggling canoe and the additional requirement for teams to enter\na 100m sprint in a randomly selected\ncanoe.\nSince those early days however, significant advances have been made in\nthe sport. At the 2002 WCJC, 5 times\nworld champion Esben Krister astounded judges with a 4 canoe \u2018Mill\u2019s\nMess\u2019, whilst the runner up Rafael\nRomero, an unlikely Mexican candidate standing only 5\u2019 3\u201d tall, attempted\na 3 canoe \u2018Rubenstein\u2019s Revenge\u2019. Sadly\nKrister died in late 2005 of internal hemorrhaging shortly after his seventh\nWCJC victory in which he performed\nan unimaginable 5 canoe half shower.\nThe Swedish team now wears sponsor\u2019s logos to the value of \u00a33.4 million;\na testament to the impact of the sport\non the world population despite its\ndangers. Crazes have hit many schools,\nparticularly for one reason or another,\nprimary schools, though after numerous reports of significant injury, death\nand the Colchester incident of 1998, it\nis now banned in most British educational establishments. If however you\nare still interested in taking up the\nsport professionally you might want to\nthink again.\nFollowing the advances in material\ntechnology most championship teams\nnow juggle carbon fibre or Kevlar ca-noes, so a basic set of three canoes\nwill cost you about \u00a34000. Practice\nand budget canoes are however, available for a reasonable cost and canoe\njuggling societies often provide rental\nequipment for their members. The Canoe Club here at Imperial can be seen\npracticing the sport in front of Beit\nquad on a regular basis, though they\nare not very good at it.\nPspelling: The future of spelling\nDavid Stewart\nI\nt is a continuing concern to the\nBritish citizen that the austerity of British English is being\neroded. More precisely, letters\nare being lost from words. Encyclop\u00e6dia has become encyclope-dia. Diarrhoea has become diarrhea.\nThrough is often misrepresented as\nthru. Clearly action must be taken until we are left with words with no letters remaining in them at all. By way\nof demonstration, we include below an\nartists impression of the word flocci-naucinihilipilification in two hundred\nyears time:\nfn\nIt is clear that we must not let such\na situation arise, for the benefit of our\nchildren, and our children\u2019s children,\nwho could find themselves reconstructing polysyllabic words out of\nsingle letters. As is well understood\nin academic circles, it is impossible\nto hold back progress; however, there\nis something that can be done. Since\nwords are generally either shorted\nfrom the middle, or the end, we propose the following strategy to conserve\nword length: we must add new letters\non to the beginning of words. This way,\nwe may preserve their length.\nWe take inspiration from words of\nalready quite prodigious austerity. Psychology, Psalm and Psalter are amongst\nthose we are interested in. The \u2018p\u2019 is in\neach case not at all necessary to the\npronunciation of the word in question,\nand so can reasonably be added to the\nbeginning without disturbing speech.\nBelow we include a table displaying a\nselection of words as they stand and\nthe modified versions as we propose:\nIt is stressed that none of these words\nwill change in sound. This will facilitate the transition; those who are adjusting to the new system will be able\nto have perfectly normal conversations\nwith those who have already adjusted\nwhile those in the know will be aware\nthat they are adjoining ps to an ever\nincreasing quantity of the words they\nuse.\nWe have investigated many extensions to this. Addition use of the p-prefix can be motivated from pterodactyl to yield such new words as ptick,\nptruck and ptoss-pot. Experimenting\nwith other words has also proved fruit-ful. Gnome gives us gnut, gnever and\ngnude. Knit additionally provides kn-incompoop, knag and knude. Wrench\nwould suggest wrandom, wrickety\nand wrollick. Moreover, what, why\nand when imply modifications such as\nOld Word\nstupid\nsick\nscry\nso\nschool\nspoon\nsun\nshit\nNew Word\npstupid\npsick\npscry\npso\npschool\npspoon\npsun\npshit\nwhood, whinkie and whank.\nWhen one drops the necessity for\ninspiration from pre-existing English\nwords, one can make more creative\nmodifications. Garden could become\nngarden, kiddy-fiddler would be fkid-dy-kfiddler, and cunt alters to rcunt.\nAs the degradation of words contin-ues, it would be necessary to repeat\nthis procedure. We could imagine new\nwords such as pspspecial being neces-sary, or gkpaper. In the example mentioned above, we can therefore predict\nfloccinaucinihipilification eventually\nbegin represented by qpygjncdrfn.\nWhile personally we may find this\ndepiction of such an apocalyptic state\nof affairs at best distressing, at worst,\nsufficient to induce suicide, the desperate position we are put in by the\ncurrent degradation renders this procedure necessary. It will be a test of our\nnation in the years to come, whether or\nnot we are able to live up to the challenge posed and relearn our pspelling.\nT\nhe Ancient Greeks were\na remarkable bunch. I\u2019ve\nleft that sentence on my\nscreen for the past three\ndays, and the more I look\nat it, the more pathetic an understatement it seems. A quick scroll through\nMicrosoft Office\u2019s usually helpful thesaurus shows how woefully inadequate\nadjectives are in an attempt to describe\nreal, unparalleled genius.\nOur Western society owes its very\nexistence to the Ancient Greeks, and\na list of all we have to be grateful for\nwould read like an encyclopaedia. Far\nsimpler to mention all those everyday\nthings that owe nothing to their remarkable discoveries; a list which, over\nthe past few hours, I have been wholly\nunable to make.\nWhere would we be, for instance,\nwithout Hippocrates, father of modern medicine? Were it not for him, we\nmight never have come to realize that\nour health is controlled by the balance\nof our four humours (phlegm, yellow\nbile, black bile and blood, for all you\nnon-medics out there). It was thanks\nto this remarkable insight that doctors\nthrough the ages knew to use leeches\nin their practices; just imagine the suffering that would have gone untreated\nin the millennia since Ancient Greece\nGilead Amit\nWhat the ancient Greeks did for us\nhad surgeons not known to bleed their\npatients. It hardly bears considering!\nSurely the most remarkable of their\ncontributions, however, were to the\nfield of science. Aristotle, perhaps the\ngreatest of his contemporaries, realized without making a single observation that the Sun, planets and stars\nall revolve around the Earth in perfect\ncircles. His model was later extended\nto include Anaximander\u2019s vision of the\nEarth as a cylinder with a height equal\nto one-third its diameter.\nThough many scientists since have\nattempted to claim his insights as their\nown, Empedocles must remain the one\ntrue father of elemental cosmogenesis\n(a slightly more technical idea that implies that the Universe is made up of\nfour distinct elements: earth, fire, water and air). He and Ocellus Lucanus,\nwho first proposed that the Universe is\neternal, with no beginning or end, set\nthe framework for the next two thousand years of research. I could go on\nand on, but I think that my point needs\nno further pressing: the science we\nknow, teach and learn today is almost\nentirely based on the work of the Ancient Greeks.\nOf course, not all their ideas were\nright. Heraclitus came to the laughable conclusion that random chance\ncontrols the workings of the Universe,\nalmost as if God played dice with the\nUniverse! His proposal goes hand in\nhand with one of Anaximander\u2019s less\nbrilliant ideas, that multiple universes\nmight exist in parallel, with different futures being lived in each. Hippasus of Metapontum dared to defy\nthe genius of Pythagoras by claiming\nthat the square root of 2 is irrational.\nWhile some may claim that his being\ndrowned by his colleagues was a little\nexcessive, I think we can all agree he\nwas worthy of ridicule.\nIt is hard to reconcile the two aspects\nof Greek society, where every idea,\nboth right and wrong, seems to have\nseen daylight for the first time. It\u2019s all\nvery well to be amazed at the farsightedness of some observations, but one\nhas to look at the other side of the coin,\nand be equally amazed at their periodic myopia. Instead of praising them for\nwhat they got right, or ridiculing them\nfor where they went wrong, we should\npraise what really deserves praise \u2013 that\none civilization, in a few generations,\ncould come up with so many wildly\noriginal, entirely heterogeneous ideas.\nWhat will we be remembered for?\nJellybean\nAncient Greek mythology gave us cool creatures like the minotaur -part man part bull\n\u201c\nAnaximander\u2019s\nvision of the\nEarth as a\ncylinder with\na height equal\nto one-third its\ndiameter\n\u201d\n\n"

Unfortunately I\ncan\u2019t read the minds of the Iranian\ngovernment but I can tell you a few\nreasons why they might and why they\nwon\u2019t.\nOne of the most common misconceptions that pervade the minds of\nWestern people is that Iran is a traditional dictatorship with maniacal President Ahmadinejad at the top; a Saddam Hussein figure in Tehran. In fact,\nwhile the Iranian government is not a\nliberal democracy, there are many different groups and factions vying for influence in government; some of which\nare opponents of Ahmadinejad. Essentially there is no one person with their\nhand over a red button labelled WAR,\nsitting in a suitably menacing room\njust waiting for their finger to slip; well\nnot in Iran anyway. However this is the\ncurrent situation and another result of\nthe political situation in Iran is that it\nis possible that one faction i.e. hardliners will benefit from the pressure\nbeing applied by the U.S. and become\nthe dominant group. To make it a little clearer, currently there are enough\ngroups with different interests in Iran\nto make it unlikely that the Iranians are\nsuddenly going to disturb your Sunday\nlunch. However in our attempts to ensure this, we may be giving ammunition to hostile elements within Iran\nwho thrive on the idea of the Western\nthreat to the Middle East.\nNow lets try that again but the other\nway around. Is the UK, or more likely\nthe U.S. or more likely still Israel going\nto launch an attack on Iran? Well\u2026 no,\nwell\u2026 maybe, well\u2026 yes. These three\nanswers aren\u2019t because I can\u2019t make up\nmy mind. It\u2019s because these three nations will behave differently given the\nsame situation. Let\u2019s look at the UK.\nWith the Army stretched to breaking\npoint, the public literally throwing up\nat the idea of war and Parliament being given the final say on going to war;\nit\u2019s just not going to happen. In the U.S.\nthe answer is a little different. While\nno politician on Capitol Hill is ruling\nout military action, it would seem that\nmilitary action in the Middle East has\nlost credibility.\nAt the same time though, it would be\nfoolish to underestimate the ability of\nAmericans to see the world in terms of\ngood and bad, friend and foe, us and\nthem. The real problem of the Iraq\nwar in the U.S. isn\u2019t that our Atlantic\nfriends are morally averse to conflict\nbut that the plan doesn\u2019t appear to be\nworking. It is unclear whether or not\nthe U.S. would again embrace conflict,\ngiven the right man (or woman) with\nthe \u201cright\u201d plan. I answered the question of the UK fairly simply and so too\nwill I answer the question of Israel.\nWhile only a fool would suggest that Israeli troops are going to push through\nSyria and Iraq to take a pot-shot at the\nman who wanted to wipe their nation\noff the map, a person of similar intelligence would suppose that Israel will\nnot take direct action. In 1981 Israeli\njets \u2013 in a unilateral surprise attack \u2013\nbombed the light-water nuclear facility\nin Osirak to prevent the development\nof Iraq\u2019s nuclear program. Only in September this year Israeli jets bombed\na suspected Syrian nuclear material\nstore.\nThe point I\u2019m putting to you is not\nthat Israelis are war loving maniacs\nwho only need someone to give them\na reason, instead I\u2019m pointing out that\npre-emptive strikes are an acceptable\npart of Israel\u2019s foreign policy and certainly in the case of Iran\u2019s nuclear pro-gram, Israel will not hesitate to attack\nif it feels sufficiently threatened.\nRegardless of whether or not the crazy people who run this world are going\nto get us killed, let\u2019s look at what the\nIslamic Republic of Iran could do to\nstrike the UK in the event of some irate\nIranians getting their way. Primarily it\ncould cause trouble for British troops\nin Iraq. We\u2019ve been told that the Iranians give support to insurgents in Iraq\nand that Iranian weapons have been\nused to kill our soldiers in southern\nIraq. Since this is already happening, I\nshould add here \u2018apparently\u2019 to keep a\nhealthy level of cynicism, then what I\nmean to say is that the Iranians could\ncause more trouble for our troops in\nIraq. In addition it could be feasibly\nconceived that Iran could also give support to the Taleban in Afghanistan. So\nalong with capturing unarmed servicemen in the Gulf, Iran could indirectly\nattack our troops.\nSerious stuff but admit it, for the majority of us, it doesn\u2019t affect our daily\nlives. This leads me back to the nuclear\nissue. Of course if Iran is developing nuclear weapons and simultaneously ballistic missile technology then\nthe situation is on a different level of\nrisk. Nuclear weapons in the hands of\npeople willing to use them or at least\nwilling to give them to non-state actors who are willing to use them certainly pose a massive immediate risk\nto the UK and the Western world. But\nhere\u2019s the problem, do I or anyone else\nknow that Iran is developing nuclear\nweapons? The U.S. and Israel say that\nit is but Iran vigorously denies this. As\nscientists we are taught not to believe\nor disbelieve something until we are\nshown evidence that strongly or definitely suggests one or the other. Well\nthere is certainly no direct evidence of\nthe Tehran Project but also there is no\nway to prove that Iran is not going to\ndevelop nuclear weapons. While you\nmay have already decided, I reserve\njudgement pending real evidence. Iran\nhas not been linked to terrorist groups\noperating in the UK and so the main\nthreat that it poses is to our troops in\nIraq and Afghanistan. Excuse me if I\nam complacent but the Burger King on\nGloucester Road is likely to be safe for\nsome time yet.\nIsraeli fighters ready for pre emptive strikes against Iran\nI hope I\u2019ve given you a measured\npicture of the current situation without out too much diatribe but in my\nclosing paragraph I\u2019m going to give it\nmy all. I\u2019m a very pessimistic person,\nalthough I don\u2019t believe that this conflict is inevitable it seems to me that\nboth Iran\u2019s, Israel\u2019s and the U.S.\u2019s capacity for diplomacy is lacking. While\nI\u2019d hope for either side to work towards\nmeaningful dialogue I worry that the\nfew \u201cstrong leaders\u201d at the top will ignore their people\u2019s desire for peace and\nprosperity, their longing for security\nand stability and their aversion to violence and conflict.\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reclines into his seat in Parliament\n\n"

Sure, the Bourne trilogy\nhad great introspective characters, but\nthis film deals with hard-hitting subject matter that genuinely hits closer\nto home.\nThe film begins by showing the audience a civilian compound in Riyadh,\nSaudi Arabia, suddenly coming under\nattack by suicide bombers under the\ncover of the National Guard. With the\nviolence explicit and indiscriminate,\nit left several poignant, horrifying images lingering around my mind for a\nconsiderable duration of time.\nWhenever US Citizens are killed\nabroad, it apparently falls to the FBI to\ninvestigate, and after getting past some\npolitical bureaucracy, Jamie Foxx and\nhis small team of agents are dispatched\nto the region.\nNow, this could easily have been\nanother terrible jingoistic film involving American killing machines mowing down the clear, definite enemy of\nfreedom, as it were, but fortunately,\nand to be honest, surprisingly, it most\ncertainly isn\u2019t.\nWith the Muslim characters in the\nfilm getting as much screen time and\ncharacter development \u2013 perhaps\nmore so \u2013 than the American leads,\nthere is a clear push by the director to\nemphasise the fact that despite distinct\ncultural differences, we are all humans\nin this world, and that anyone is capable of anything. A minor role in the\nfilm encapsulates all the stereotypes\nmany people around the world hold\ntoday, by expressing his views that the\nentirety of a race and religious collective is responsible for the actions of the\nfew, and one that the film very successfully attempts to debunk.\nDespite the political weight this\nfilm carries, it never once attempts to\nthrust it in your face; instead, it delicately portrays a human drama unfolding before your eyes, one that is both\nthrilling and meaningful enough to\nkeep you hooked right until the closing credits.\nIt is labelled as an action thriller, so\ndo not go into the cinema expecting\na full, in-depth analysis of the current\nsituation on the so-called \u2018war on terror\u2019. I despise the view that a film can\neither be an action flick or an intelligent eye-opener, and this film exists to\nthrow out these archaic rules set down\nby hundreds of draconian film critics.\nThe Kingdom is indubitably an eclec-tic, pleasing mix of a thriller based on\ncurrent events, and it most certainly\nhandles everything intelligently. Nothing seems out of place or biased. This\nis a film about retribution, loss, and\nshowing that everyone, no matter what\nage, race, or religion, is capable of evil.\nMost of the action sequences occur\nduring the final third of the film, and by\nthis point you will find yourself almost\ncheering on the US-Saudi team rapidly\ngaining on the terrorists responsible\nfor the heinous crimes perpetuated a\nfew hours earlier. I genuinely wanted\nan eye for an eye by this point \u2013 to see\nthose responsible killed in swift retri-bution. This played into the film\u2019s moral core perfectly: essentially, what this\nfilm aims to do is show the audience\nthat many people\u2019s actions are based\non the most primal of instincts, and\nin this sense the epilogue is as chilling\nas the opening scene, with an all too\nsimilar mentality being put forward by\nboth sides of the same coin, leaving the\naudience with a provoking thought to\ndwell on.\nAn excellent score and some terrific\nleads \u2013 most notably the endearing\nSaudipoliceofficerportrayedbyAshraf\nBarhom \u2013 make this a film worth more\nthan the asking price. With no stupefy-Away from the festival, Robin George Andrews discovers a terror thriller with surprisingly high intellect\nThe Kingdom \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Peter Berg\nWriter: Matthew Michael\nCamahan\nCast: Jamie Foxx,\nChris Cooper,\nJennifer Garner\ning twists or unrealistic plot progres-sion, it is entirely believable and is\nsomething that no-one can justifiably\nclaim is offensive or Americanised.\nSo there you have it: an intelligently-handled, emotionally in-depth thriller\nthat is not afraid to show you the dark\nside of humanity and the cost of following \u2013 and fighting against \u2013 extremism\nin the world today. More than your average American thriller, no?\nThe Kingdom moves everyone onto axis of evil\nFor more books in\nthe Rough Guide\ncatalogue, head to:\nwww.roughguides.com\nYou know, that outfit would look great with a bit more colour in it\n\n"

    "content": "39\nfelix\nFriday 2 November 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nHow to train the abs, Part II\nAndy Mitchell\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nLast week we looked at reasons not\nto crunch. So, what exactly should\nyou be doing to train your abdominal\nmuscles?\nWhen all is said and done, there are\ncertain times and certain reasons why\nyou would add crunches into your\nworkout, though these are generally\ndue to rehabilitation purposes. If having read this you still insist on doing\ncrunches then at least do them on a\nSwissBall rather than the floor and also\ncome and ask an Instructor how to\ndo the exercise properly, as I see very\nfew people in the gym performing the\ntechnique correctly.\nLeg-raises are also a problem abdominal exercise, but are often performed\nin the gym. Most people believe that\nthis exercise will work their lower abs\nand this is true, as long as you perform\nthe exercise correctly. Unfortunately if\nyou go to the gym and observe most\npeople performing this exercise, they\nare doing it incorrectly resulting in\nthem over exercising their hip flexors\n(which can lead to lower back injuries)\nand placing large amounts of pressure on their lower backs. The lower\npart of the rectus abdominis inserts\ninto the pubic bone of the pelvis and\ndoes not connect to your legs. Therefore swinging your legs up, down and\nin any other direction, does not work\nyour lower abdominal muscles. The\nonly way you can exercise the lower\nabs through the leg-raise exercise is\nby maintaining a neutral pelvic position (from activation of the lower abs)\nagainst the pull of the hip flexors on\nthe lumbar spine (the origin of the hip\nflexors). As I have said, from observing\npeople performing the leg-raise exercise in the gym you can clearly see that\ntheir lower backs are coming up off the\nfloor showing no sign of lower abdominal activation. Furthermore, if you like\ngetting your mate to throw your legs\ntowards the floor to enhance the exer-cise, you are only adding further pressure to your lower back increasing the\nrisk of injury. Many people will claim\nthey can feel their abdominal muscles\nworking in this exercise, in most cases\nit is the hip flexors that you can feel as\nthey originate from the lumber spine\nbelow your abdominal muscles. Having tested hundreds of people on this\nexercise only about 1% has ever been\nable to maintain neutral pelvic position whilst slowly lowering their legs\ndown, let alone anyone who can do it\nwith a friend throwing the legs down!\nIf you would like to test the strength\n(or sadly in most cases the weakness)\nof your lower abdominals drop by the\ngym and an Instructor will be able to\nshow you how strong they really are!\nSo what exercises should you be performing in the gym to get functionally\nstrong abdominals? The oblique muscles (the side of the stomach) are the\nmost used stomach muscles in everyday life and sporting activities. Therefore these should be trained more\noften than the rectus abdominis. Exercises such as Russian twists and wood-chops are ideal ways of developing\nstrength and power in these muscles.\nAs I said earlier the rectus abdominis\nis designed to work as a stabiliser of the\nlumbo-pelvic region and so are actually best trained with an exercise such\nas the plank (a great exercise but commonly performed incorrectly, again\nsee an Instructor to learn to do them\nproperly) or through other exercises\nsuch as cleans, squats and deadlifts.\nExplosive exercises using Medicine\nballs and Tornado balls are also a great\nway to develop strength and power in\nall of the abdominal muscles.\nSadly there is not enough space to\nwrite about all these exercises in detail\nand this article only touches the surface of an area of training that is highly\ncomplex. Even to go into how many\nrepetitions and sets to perform would\ntake up a whole article! I can only suggest that if you would like to know\nmore about abdominal training or ask\nany questions related to this article you\ncome and see me some time on the\ngym floor where I can go further into\nthe topic.\nWeek 4 and a lot more results are in,\nmost of which are wins.\nThe ranking of the teams is based on\nthe Felix Index (FI), which is calculated\nas follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) \u2013 (L*4).\nOnly teams with 5 games or more will\nbe considered in the overall championship at the end of year.\nWith this week\u2019s results in, Netball\n1sts are again top of the league, with\nsquash men\u2019s 1st and tennis men\u2019s 2nd\nalso winning their games.

With both Team\nCaptain Chris and Club President\nChris having spent much of the summer training with the ULU team, there\nwas a certain amount of healthy rivalry\ngoing into this match. First up was the\nfoil match, having both fenced ULU\u2019s\ntop foilist on many occasions, there\nwas much debate over which Chris\nshould take the anchor position for\nthe final bout. Captain Chris decided\nagainst taking it himself which meant\nhe started the match with the first bout\nagainst their top foilist. Despite a hard\nfought fight, after losing this first bout\nthe Imperial team never quite managed\nto regain the upper hand with Nathan,\nthe one member of the team to never\nhave fenced any of the ULU team, having the most success (who said left-handers were awkward). Chris decided\nto substitute himself for reserve Alex\nfor his final bout, but even this change\nto a fresh fencer did nothing to save the\nfoil team and left the other Chris with\nan unenviable chase in the final bout.\nWith the pressure on Chris went into\nthe bout knowing that he had beaten\nhis opponent before, though this\nthough was not to be his day and the\nfoil victory went to ULU.\nBeth Jelfs\nEpee was up next, despite being experienced fencers all three of the epee-ists are freshers so this was their first\nBUSA team match and added to that\nthey were going into it knowing the\nteam really needed a win in epee to\nkeep them in with a chance of winning.\nThe first bout started well for Ed but after a close fight eventually went ULUs\nway. Sjoerd and Alessandro\u2019s bouts followed in a similar vein and despite the\nbest efforts of all three fencers by the\ntime it came to the final bout, short of\na minor miracle, a win was realistically\nbeyond Imperial\u2019s grasp. Despite this\nAlessandro was not giving up that easily and gave the ULU fencer a good run\nfor his money.\nFinally up last was the sabre and short\nof winning by a huge margin this was\nmainly for the pride. Sabre started well\nwith an easy victory for Charlie over\nthe injured ULU captain and continued\nwell. Despite being primarily a foilist\nAlex had the best performance of the\nmatch in sabre (and was ultimately the\nonly member of the team to avoid the\nforfeits in the bar later). All was looking good until the final bout where,\ndespite good performance, Wookie\ngave away 11 points of their lead before finally managing the 5 needed for\na win in sabre. Unfortunately this win\nin sabre was not enough to make up\nfor the previous losses and ULU won\nthe overall match. All that was left was\na trip to the ULU bar for a drink with\nour hosts and to administer the forfeits\nfor bad performances, though whilst\nthere, small consolation was found in\nthe news that the Mens 2nd team had\nat least won their first match.\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd Fencing team got\ntheir season off to the perfect start\nwith a hard fought victory against St\nGeorge\u2019s 1st team that went right to\nthe wire.\nLate arrivals dictated that Sabre\nwould be fenced first. St George\u2019s took\nan early lead when Will Hoy found\nhimself defeated 3 \u2013 5 in the first match\nand despite Luka Lukic, Maurice Berk\nand the aforementioned Will battling\nvaliantly, it was a lead they were never\nable to overcome, eventually succumbing 38 \u2013 45 in that weapon.\nFoil was up next and this proved to\nfeature some of the most controversial and electrifying moments of the\nmatch. Ez Hassan eventually made his\nway to a 5 \u2013 3 victory in the first match,\nwith tensions running high over debatable referring decisions. Next up was\nNorris who struggled in his first con-test, managing 4 hits to their 7 and\nsurrendering the lead. Nathan Blundell\nscored 5 in his first, leaving the contest\nbalanced on a knife edge at 14 \u2013 15.\nNorris then redeemed himself with a\nfine 6 \u2013 2 victory over the opposition\ncaptain before Ez further extended the\nlead to 25 \u2013 20. Nathan then produced\nsome simply sublime fencing, thrashing their best foilist 5 \u2013 1, apparently\nputting the game beyond doubt at 30\nFencing\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 128\nSt. George\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 121\nMaurice Berk\n\u2013 21, and earning himself the Man of\nthe Match award. Yet rather than rolling over and accepting their fate, St\nGeorge\u2019s bounced back with two massive victories, leaving the final score for\nfoil a nail-bitingly close 45 \u2013 43.\nGoing into \u00e9pe\u00e9, the combined\nscores stood at 83 \u2013 88, requiring the\nfinal weapon to be won by at least 5\npoints. Luka set the ball rolling with a\n5 \u2013 3 victory and Maurice\u2019s blushes due\nto a 3 \u2013 7 defeat were saved when Ez\nfollowed this up with a 7 \u2013 2 victory,\nleaving Imperial 3 points in the lead.\nMaurice\u2019s 5 \u2013 5 draw in the next match\nup did nothing to change the situation\nwhile Luka\u2019s hard work to extend the\nlead by 2 points in his 5 \u2013 3 victory was\npartially undone when Ez found himself on the wrong end of 5 \u2013 6 score\nline. With 4 points in the lead and 3\nmatches to go, team captain Maurice\nstepped up to the piste and exploited\nthe inexperience of his opponent to the\nfull, with a resounding 5 \u2013 1 victory, increasing the lead to 8 points and seemingly putting the match beyond doubt.\nEz drew his final match up 5 \u2013 5 while\nLuka made sure with another excellent\nperformance in a 5 \u2013 1 victory, leaving\nthe final score for \u00e9pe\u00e9 45 \u2013 33 and the\ncombined score 128 \u2013 121.\nFencing 1st lose out to ULU\nAfter two seasons away from the BUSA\nleague, IC\u2019s Men\u2019s Table Tennis team\nmade their return this time with the\nstrongest squad to date.\nOur campaign kicked off a few\nweeks ago at King\u2019s College. Imperial\nstarted off like a steam train taking the\nfirst eleven rubbers without reply, at\nwhich point I became the weakest link\nand allowed King\u2019s to pull one back!\nThere were times when King\u2019s did look\nthreatening especially towards the end\nof the match but IC was quick to respond and closed out the match 16-1.\nIt was a dominant performance from\nthe team. Serkan, Gaetan and Kevin\nwere unbeaten and in particular, Kevin\nwon all his matches without dropping\na set!\nIC went into the next match against\nUCL with real confidence boosted by\nthe support of the home crowd. There\nwere two changes to the team with Wei\nLun Wong and Eddie Liu joining Gaetan and Kevin in the line-up.\nWe got off to a great start as Gaetan\nTable tennis domiante Kings, then fall to UCL\nTable Tennis\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 16\nWilliam Do\nopened up proceedings with a dominant 3-0 win over Jonathan De Wind.\nUCL hit back immediately with Rizwan\nUmarjee beating Wei Lun 9-11, 11-9,\n11-6, 11-9. Eddie was up next and he\nedged out a close first set against Jackie\nCheung, then raced through the second set before Jackie took the next two\nto force a decider. It was a tight final set\nbut it was Jackie who prevailed making\nan inspiring comeback to win 11-13,\n6-11, 11-7, 11-6, 11-9.

Approximately 65 people from different clubs such\nas Rugby, Hockey, Netball, Volleyball,\nBadminton and Swimming, signed up\nfor a week of gruelling circuits, agility\ntraining, and sports specific warm-up\nexercises, as set out by the Energia fitness team.\nThe athletes were not only put\nthrough their paces indoors at Ethos\nwith some tough circuit training but\noutdoors too, in Hyde Park.\n\u201cAs a first attempt at running a programme of this type, the week was an\nunprecedented success,\u201d commented\nLuke Taylor, ACC Chair. \u201cThe Training Week was a great inspiration for\nthe ACC clubs to adopt a more professional attitude to their sport, and also\nto have a bit of fun before term started.\nHopefully for next year we can adjust\nthe content of the Training Week program to better reflect what the sports\nteams want to see included, but the\nturnout of over 30 members from the\nIC Rugby Club proves that there is the\ndesire in the ACC for something of this\nsort to be offered to clubs.\u201d\nAll in all this was a positive week for\nSaturday 27th October\nFootball \u2013 ULU\nICU Men\u2019s 1st N/A\nLSE Men\u2019s 2nd N/A\nSt. Bart\u2019s & London Men\u2019s 1st 5\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nICU Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nKing\u2019s College Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nTennis\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 1\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 9\nMonday 29th October\nBadminton \u2013 ULU\nQueen Mary Mixed 1st N/A\nICU Mixed 1st N/A\nBasketball \u2013 ULU\nICU Men\u2019s 1st N/A\nGoldsmith\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st N/A\nNetball \u2013 ULU\nICU 1st Played the whole match\nKing\u2019s Medical\u2019s 3rd Buggered off at half time\nICU 2nd 35\nSt. George\u2019s Hospital 3rd 12\nFixtures and Results in association with Sports Partnership\nSaturday 27th October\nFootball \u2013 ULU\nRoyal Holloway Men\u2019s 2nd v ICU Men\u2019s 1st\nLSE Men\u2019s 2nd v ICU Men\u2019s 2nd\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 1st v ICU Men\u2019s 3rd\nKing\u2019s College Men\u2019s 3rd v ICU Men\u2019s 4th\nUCL Men\u2019s 5th v ICU Men\u2019s 5th\nKing\u2019s Medical\u2019s Men\u2019s 4th v ICU Men\u2019s 6th\nICU Men\u2019s 7th v Queen Mary Men\u2019s 4th\nGoldsmith\u2019s 2nd 29\nICU 3rd 23\nSquash - ULU\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 3\nUCL Men\u2019s 1st 2\nKing\u2019s College Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 4\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 4\nICU Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nICU Women\u2019s 1st N/A\nSt. George\u2019s Hospital Women\u2019s 1st N/A\nWednesday 31st October\nBadminton\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 3\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 1st 5\nKingston Men\u2019s 1st 5\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 3\nUniversity of Exeter Women\u2019s 1st 4\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 4\nFencing\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 119\nSouthampton Men\u2019s 1st 124\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 118\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 128\nFootball\nSt. Mary\u2019s College 1\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 1\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nUniversity of Essex Men\u2019s 3rd 2\nRoyal Holloway Men\u2019s 2nd 4\nICU Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nICU Men\u2019s 5th (ULU) 2\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 3rd (ULU) 1\nRUMS Men\u2019s 4th (ULU) 2\nICU Men\u2019s 7th (ULU) 1\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 0\nQueen Mary Women\u2019s 1st 1\nHockey\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 3\nUni. of Hertfordshire Men\u2019s 1st 1\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 14\nUniversity of Essex Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nUniversity of Portsmouth Men\u2019s 4th 2\nICU Men\u2019s 4th 0\nBrunel Women\u2019s 2nd 1\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 6\nICU Women\u2019s 2nd 2\nUniversity of Sussex Women\u2019s 2nd 1\nLacrosse\nRoyal Holloway Women\u2019s 1st 5\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 7\nNetball\nICU 1st 51\nUni. of Hertfordshire 2nd 16\nICU 2nd TO BE\nUniversity of Essex 3rd REARRANGED\nRugby Union\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 31\nUniversity of Portsmouth Men\u2019s 1st 0\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 17\nUniversity of Portsmouth Men\u2019s 2nd 5\nLSE Men\u2019s 3rd 12\nICU Men\u2019s 3rd 39\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 21\nUCL Women\u2019s 1st 17\nSquash\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 5\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 1st 0\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 5\nICU Women\u2019s 1st WALKOVER TO\nUniversity of Surrey Women\u2019s 1st IMPERIAL\nTable Tennis\nLondon South Bank Men\u2019s 1st WITHDRAWN\nICU Men\u2019s 1st\nKing\u2019s College Women\u2019s 1st 2\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 3\nTennis\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 5\nUniversity of Portsmouth Men\u2019s 1st 5\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 8\nKingston Men\u2019s 1st 2\nKing\u2019s College Women\u2019s 1st 3\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 7\n36\nthose involved, as they have all started the season very well and are benefitting from the time and energy they\nspent in preparation for the start of the\ncompetitive season.

Building on last weeks\nperformance, only one change was\nmade to the team.\nThe game started a little slowly for\nImperial\u2019s liking, with the forwards\nbeing shooved back a few times in the\nscrums, however Portsmouth were unable to stop the free flowing style that\nthe 1sts also have. This became evident\nwhen Flannan O\u2019Maoney slid through\nthe defence and then off loaded the ball\nthe prop forward who gained 30 meters before going to ground and winning a penalty. Winger Rob Phillipps\nhappily went across the try line to give\nImperial the lead.\nPortsmouth did not take to this too\nwell and their tempers started to fray\nwith late, high and dangerous tackles happening all over the place, and\neventually a fight. This only spurned\non the Imperial pack who turned over\na Portsmouth scrum which Joe Brown\npounced upon and scored a try, leaving\nthe score at 10 - 0 at half time.\nIn the second half, you could sense\nthat Imperial had a point to prove, and\nthey did. The forwards started to rumble the ball, setting up rolling mauls\nwith Alex Johnstone and Tom Zeal\nscoring a try from it. The backs were\nrunning tremedous lines, especially\nTom Carroll, but it was Alex Johnstone\nwho charged down a kick and scored\nanother try, leaving the score at 31 - 0\nat full time.\nA tremendous performance from a\nteam who, according to the coach, still\nhaven\u2019t gelled fully!

With Radiohead\u2019s new offering, a\npotential Bob Dylan in-the-making in the form of Stephen Fretwell and even a Ghost, what\u2019s not to like?\nRadiohead\nIn Rainbows\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nAlbum Review\nNow if mediocrity was currency, and\nthe British alternative music scene was\na person, that person would be richer\nthan a member of one of these mediocre bands. Ingenuity and excitement\nare quite hard to come by in today\u2019s\nalternative music scene, with some albums being as bland and contrived as\nthe above metaphor and a lot of alternative bands being hackneyed, unim-aginative- possibly both, or even having all three of the above problems.\nBut there has been a band, a certain\nrock outfit which has been the saving grace of British alternative music\nthroughout the 90\u2019s and beyond, who\nseem to still be holding strong where\nother seminal artists from the past\ncouple of decades have died out (not\nliterally died, I mean have become\nunpopular or become another band\nwhich is not as good). These saviours\ngo by the name of, I believe, Radiohead. Some may say it\u2019s Oasis, but its\nnot, it\u2019s Radiohead.\nRadiohead have been churning out\nalbums and hoards of b-sides which\nare consistently creative, original and\nI would even go as far to say \u201crevolutionary\u201d (in popular music terms) for\nover a decade. Their work has made\na place for itself in the list of seminal\nalbums of not only the 90\u2019s, but of\nall time. Such magnificent works for\nwhich they are responsible, include\ntheir mid-90\u2019s album, Ok Computer\n(which topped Channel Four\u2019s prestigious \u201cBest albums ever\u201d list), the more\nexperimental 2000 release, Kid A,\nwhich drew heavy influences from the\nWarp records brand of electro-stuff,\nAmnesiac (with all recordings made\nduring the same sessions as Kid A) and\nthe more recent release X&Y...\nOnly joking about that last one, it is\nnot a magnificent work. (Nah, I actually quite like that album and Coldplay.)\nThe band, fronted by Thom Yorke,\nfamous for his trademark falsetto vocals and political opinions (both of\nwhich can be sampled on his solo album The Eraser), have been fairly quiet\nsince 2003\u2019s Hail to the Thief, another\nalbum that would be the magnum-opus of a lesser bands career but hasn\u2019t\ngarnered blanket critical acclaim, leading many to believe Radiohead to have\npeaked creatively at Kid A. But the band\nreturn from their \u201chiatus\u201d with a completely new album In Rainbows, which\nis currently only available on download\nfrom their website with a unique sales\napproach where you, that\u2019s right- you\nthe consumer can choose your own\nprice (however there is a service charge\nof 45p but still, at least you don\u2019t have\nto fork out \u00a38 for it. Just be grateful\nthat Radiohead have had the decency\nto liberate you from your consumerist\nhell). This may seem strange, but this\nis due to the absence of a record contract and they probably have enough\nmoney anyway and if they don\u2019t then,\nthey\u2019ll have enough if you buy the disc-box (released 3rd December) for \u00a340.\nAnyway, that\u2019s enough about prices\nand all that lark, I\u2019ll start talking about\nthe actual album content.\nIn comparison to all their previous albums this one seems far more\nrelaxed, it floats smoothly from start\nto finish and is set far apart from the\ntumultuous, mercurial tones of Hail to\nthe Thief. Lyrically, it still has the same\nthemes of tense modern living and hellish urban nightmares, but this album is\nfar lighter than Hail to the thief which\nwas teaming with tension and anger,\npossibly due to the quick \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d\nstyle of recording they applied to it.\nThe band seem to have applied the opposite recording technique in this case\n\u2013 as any Radiohead fan will know, they\nhave been recording this album for approximately eight million years.\nAnyone hoping for a return of the\nguitar driven anthems of The Bends\nwill be disappointed, and anyone hoping for a reincarnation of Kid A will\nalso be so. In fact, anyone hoping for\na repeat of another album-style will be\ndisappointed. Radiohead have made a\nhabit of entering a new vein of music\nwith each album and this is no excep-tion. The album is unlike any other but\nit is comprised of elements of some, if\nnot all of their past work. To put some\nsort of relativity into the matter it is as\nif Hail to the Thief has had a car crash\nwith Ok Computer and the emergency\nservices turn up, but instead of the\nemergency services it is actually Kid\nA with The Eraser in the background\n\u2018rubbernecking\u2019. I hope that confused\nmess of personification can give you\nsome idea.\nThe album opens with a hammering\nelectronic beat and Yorke soon enters\nwith his usual vocal acrobatics. After\n18 seconds of listening, I was worried\nThom Yorke had persuaded the band\nto make an Eraser Part 2, but I was\nsoon saved by the clean, melodic guitar which glides in to the song. 15 Step\n(the opening track) builds up gradually and it is clear this is Radiohead as\na band. This sets the tone for the rest\nof the album with the mixture of heavy\npercussion (reminiscent of Boards\nof Canada at some stages), plenty of\nbustling ambient noise comprising of\nstrings and synths and a noticeably\nlarge presence of guitar. Many fans\nwill be familiar with the three song,\nNude from various live performances\nand some bootleg albums of such performances (for the curious, see Erasing Warnings which is comprised of\nlive tracks from Toronto). The song is\nelegant, soft and flowing, building up\ngradually from an almost Treefingersesque beginning, transforming into an\nunfamiliar style. You will begin to question whether this is in fact rock music.\nIt becomes apparent at this point that\nif Hail to the Thief was Radiohead\nhaving fun, In Rainbows is Radiohead\nworking. The album is consistent but\nloosely bound lyrically, it is unified by\nstrands of a minimalistic style, it is mature and thoroughly accomplished, it is\nclear that Radiohead made this album\nto be viewed as one work, a united collection of music which is meant to be\nheard together. The concept of composition of an album is clearly thought of\nas an art to Radiohead, shown by their\nunwillingness to let iTunes sell single\ntracks from the album.\nThe only thing I have to say against\nthis album is that it is lacking in any\nparticular stand-out tracks, but that\nis countered by the consistent quality throughout. It blends minimalism,\ntuneful vocals with often heavy beats\nand thrashing distorted guitar, such\nas in the wild scaling sounds of Bodysnatchers. On a whole, this album is\nmellower than Radiohead\u2019s previous\nalbums but Yorke\u2019s lyrics conjure up\nimages of 21st century alienation and\nan anxious society which is, in his own\nwords, \u201cterrifying\u201d. The album reaches\nit\u2019s peak of mellowness with House\nof Cards, 5 minutes and 28 seconds\nwhich float by and could easily lead a\nlistener into a world of slumber. That\u2019s\nin a good way by the way.\nAnyway I must conclude due to a\nword limit [Cough \u2013 Editor]. In Rainbows is consistent in quality and although definitely not what the fans\nwere expecting, I believe they have delivered something superb, refusing to\nduplicate any previous works or styles\nand again reinventing themselves. Although no songs stand out as being\nclassics when you first listen, they will\ndefinitely grow on you. If you are a fan\nbuy it, if you have never heard of them,\nbuy it, and if you have heard them and\nhated them, just pinch your mate\u2019s CD\nand give it another listen.\nDeni Edgars\nDon\u2019t expect Radiohead\u2019s new album, In Rainbows, to be quite this tranquil\nDuke Spirit Competition\nWin the chance to see The\nDuke Spirit play live in your\nliving-room!\nFollowing the announcement\nof their latest tour The Duke\nSpirit are running a competition where a fan will win\nthe opportunity to have the\nband play live at their own\nprivate party in their house to\ncelebrate the release of their\nlatest EP\n, Ex Voto.

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames\nGames Editors \u2013 Azfarul Islam and Sebastian Nordgren\nAzfarul \u201cAz\u201d Islam\nGames Editor\nN\normally, I\u2019m not much\nof a handheld gamer.\nI\u2019ve randomly had\ngoes at the Gamegear,\nGameboy, Gameboy\nAdvance(s) and the two newer ones\nover the last decade or so. Sure, I did\nhave quite some fun with the games,\nbut never did I find a handheld console\nbeckoning me to purchase one for my\nown. Given that I had a deluge of great\ngames to get through on my PS2, my\ngaming time was devoted to such.\nThen I realised only recently that I\nwasn\u2019t exactly playing the most enticing games on these Console Minis.\nA week ago, I had touched WarioWare (pun intended) on the DS and\nI\u2019ve found myself completely hooked.\nAnd what\u2019s not to love? Designed as a\nseries of ephemeral mini-games, you\nend up breezing through the zaniest\nvariety of tasks you\u2019ll have attempted\nin a game thus far. Within a span of a\nminute or so, I picked a nose, made a\ncouple fall for each other, connected a\nlightbulb and sucked an entire galaxy\ninto an unforgiving swirling vortex. All\nin a day\u2019s work, really. Insane. There\u2019s\nhardly any time, initially, to climb the\nlearning curve. The instructions are\nbasic and minimal: it\u2019s upto you to\nfigure out how to succeed and then\ndo so - all within a span of five to ten\nseconds.\nSimilarly, I\u2019ve been able to muck\naround with a PSP for quite some time\nas well. Virtua Tennis didn\u2019t end so well\nwith the A.I. trouncing me until I realised that I was playing on the highest\ndifficulty. It\u2019s quite a different feel from\nits console brethren, but that doesn\u2019t\ndeny the game some impressive visuals\nand solid gameplay mechanics. Later\non I got in a couple of hours with Metal Gear AC!D. Now, I\u2019m a Metal Gear\nfan first and foremost (judge me by my\nHalo articles at your own risk heh) and\nAC!D is the furthest departure from\nthe series I\u2019ve seen. They turn a spon-taneous, stylistic stealth game into, of\nall things, a tactical card-based battler.\nIt\u2019s not Magic: The Gathering or Duel\nMasters, but it\u2019s still a design decision\nthat\u2019s bizarre at best. Within a span of\ntwo hours, I had to come to grips with\na rule system that lacked intuitive-ness, a few rounds of bad luck when\ndrawing cards and a group of enemies\nwho spasmed between absolute idiots\nto ruthless pack hunters. And yet, it\nwas a thoroughly entertaining experi-ence. Oddities involved having cards\nfor every. Single. Action. Movement?\nCheck. Climbing over waist-high box-es? Check. Random, insignificant task\nrequiring basic motor skills? Check.\nThe soldiers I was assigned to kill were\nan odd bunch. During an alert scene\ntwo of them, on the verge of tracking\nme down, ended up in a storeroom\nand did god-knows-what for the entire\nsequence until the alert was taken off.\nYeah, definitely not creepy [/sarcasm].\nHowever, the overall experience left\nme realising that handheld games have\nreally carved a fantastic, more focused\nniche for themselves over the years. I\ndefinitely need one now *hint hint*\nThis\nWeek\nPhantom Hourglass class\nShould you trust this wierdo? Be careful of your dentures!\nReady for new adventures? I don\u2019t think so\nEduardo Vasquez-Silva finds a silent cartographer and goes on another epic quest\nT\nhe Legend of Zelda is a\nfranchise full of surprises,\nas fans never know what\nto expect from each game,\nbut they know that a game\nwith the princess\u2019 name on it is guaranteed to be great (for those thinking of\nthe CDi disasters, do yourself a favour\nand assume they were never made).\nTake Ocarina of Time, for instance.\nThe jump from 2D to 3D was something that concerned many gamers,\nas it was hard to imagine how things\nwould work in a polygonal world.\nLuckily, the wizards of Nintendo did\nwhat they do best and delivered one\nof the finest pieces of software ever to\ngrace a console. The Wind Waker also\nsurprised many with its different looks\nand combat system, but again, it was\none of the best games on its system.\nSo when Nintendo announced that\nthere would be a sequel to The Wind\nWaker (TWW) on the Dual Screens, I\ngot really excited, but felt a bit sceptical at the same time. Mainly because\nthe cartoony art style of TWW never\nreally convinced me, and the fact that\nLink would only be controlled using\nthe stylus was something I couldn\u2019t\nsee working very well. Luckily, I was\nwrong. Phantom Hourglass has now\nbecome my favourite DS game, and\nprobably the best one out there.\nWhat makes this game so damn good\nis actually the way it is controlled. As I\nsaid, you control Link by simply touching on the screen wherever you want\nhim to go, and he will faithfully follow.\nHowever, it happens to work fantastically well. Fighting is as simple (and\nsurprisingly satisfactory) as tapping on\nyour enemies, although some require a\nlittle more skill than others.\nThis is a Zelda game and most standards are here: lots of dungeons full of\nenemies and puzzles that will push\nyour brain harder than Kawashima\u2019s\nBrain Training, lots of different weap-ons, places to visit and people to talk\nReader Rating: 9.5 / 10\nto. However, it is the new way in which\nall these features are implemented\nwhere this game excels.\nPhantom Hourglass does a fantastic\njob at using all the capabilities of the\nDS. To use certain weapons, such as\nthe boomerang, you simply draw on\nthe screen the trajectory you want it\nto follow. Then let go. Enjoy. Repeat. It\nnever gets old.\nSome puzzles are so inventive, they\nactually require gamers to think in\nways they are not used to. I particularly remember an enemy I was told\nwas \u201csensitive to loud noises\u201d. What\nI thought would be one of the most\npredictable ways of defeating an enemy ended up being one of the biggest\nsurprises I\u2019ve had while playing games.\nAll I did was throw bombs at him, hoping he would run away crying due to\nthe noise, but nothing worked. After a\nwhile, I remembered that the DS has a\nmicrophone incorporated. I thought\nabout it for a second, but then I just\nwent for it and yelled at it. To my sur-prise, the foe did actually get scared, as\ndid the rest of the people who were on\nthe bus with me.\nOne of the most inventive uses of the\ntouch screen is to actually write memos\non your map or sea chart. This being a\nZelda game, this comes in very handy,\ngiven that there are places you know\nyou\u2019ll have to come back to when you\nare appropriately equipped, or people\nyou\u2019ll have to do favours to.\nAnother thing that really helps this\ngame stand out is its presentation. It\u2019s\njust beautiful to look at: the colours are\nbright, animations are smooth and the\nsound demands the use of headphones.\nThe music is really good, my favourite\ntune being the one you hear while you\nare cruising the seas, which is good,\nbecause you\u2019ll do it a lot.\nFor a DS game, this is a very long one.\nThe main adventure can take from 12\nto 15 hours to complete. However, this\nis one of the things that really, really\nbothered me about Phantom Hourglass. There is one temple that you have\nto revisit several occasions, and every\ntime you go in, you have to go through\nevery single room you had already\nbeaten. Again, and again, which is kind\nof repetitive. I found this a lame excuse\nto make it feel like a longer lasting ad-venture. Fair enough, you\u2019ll eventually\nget upgrades that allow you go through\nit quicker, but that doesn\u2019t help the fact\nthat you are doing the same stuff over\nand over!!...phew\u2026I had to get that off\nmy chest\u2026.Well, I guess it really isn\u2019t\nsuch a big deal, after all. It\u2019s probably\njust THE ONE thing that keeps this\ngame from a 10/10.\nOverall, this is an awesome game: it\nlooks great, the sound and music are\ntop-notch and the puzzles and gameplay do the console fair justice. It will\nstay in your DS for weeks, and if you\ndon\u2019t have a DS, go buy one now. Trust\nme, it\u2019s that good.\nLink Teaches Writing\u2122\nCue Indiana Jones\u2019 theme The Treasure is a lie!\nHackity-slashity fun returns!

We tell you why Paris is the horniest place on Earth and then\ngive you ideas on how to have the sexiest time while there. Don\u2019t say Felix never helped your sex life!\nNadine Richards\nTravel Editor\nSex? Did someone say sex? Have I got\nyour attention? Good. Now keep on\nreading! I have to be honest with you:\nthis won\u2019t be an account of my sexual\nexperiences in Paris (for that, I advise\nwatching \u201cOne Night in Paris\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s\nnot a personal account by any means,\nbut Salamon\u2019s account is surely adequate enough). However, I can promise\nto reveal to you my sexual encounter\nalong the Seine. In the meantime, let\u2019s\nstart with how to have the sexiest time\nin the sexiest city on Earth.\nIf Paris is the most sexy city on Earth,\nthen it must also be the most horny.\nHow, you ask, can a city be horny? Let\nus start with the Montmarre, the red\nlight district of Paris, home to seedy\nnightclubs and the usual tacky sex-shops. If you\u2019re a man and fancy a\npleasant stroll amongst the backdrop\nof neon-lighting, I suggest trying your\nhand at a nightclub in Pigalle where\nyou\u2019ll most likely find women happy\nto try their hands on you. If you\u2019re a\nwoman, then fear not, there are other\noptions for a quick drink and a quick\ngrope in Pigalle: just try standing outside one of the gawdy clubs, and you\u2019ll\nland yourself one very quickly.\nBefore you worry about the state of\nmy mental health, we really did try\nstarting our trip in a normal manner. A\nwonderful scenic stroll along the Seine\nwas the initial plan: and it was certainly\nas charming as can be imagined. Look\nat the Notre Dame and Saint Michel\nBridge lit up so beautifully at dusk,\nwith all those happy couples drinking\nchampagne and frolicking romantically beside the riverbanks, whilst the\nsymbol of Paris can be spotted making its distinct impression against the\nskyline of Paris. Ok, so the Spanish\n13-year olds did harass us constantly\nwith immature sexual jokes along our\nriver cruise of the Seine and somewhat\nspoilt the fantastic atmospheric view,\nand my fantastic fantasy of finding a fit\nFrenchie to frolic with beside the riv-erbanks. But ahh, aren\u2019t they so young\nand sweet really, before they grow into\nsleazy Spanish men who deserve to be\npunched in the face for inappropriate\ncomments. Anyway, where was I? As\nwe promenaded our way across Pont\nde l\u2019Alma, I recall thinking to myself\nthat Paris was the most romantic city\nI had ever been to. It suddenly caught\nour attention that a peculiar old man\nwas standing beside the Seine, wearing\na long coat, and, having opened it, he\ndisplayed nothing except his nakedness\nand his Eiffel Tower. Suddenly Paris\nseemed less romantic \u2013 just more like\nan exhibitionist trying way too hard.\n(That pun was unintentional, I swear)\nSo this brings me back to the concept\nthat Paris is the sexiest, most horny\ncity. If this theory can be extended to\npeople, then are the most sexy people\nalso the most horny? (well, I\u2019ll leave\nthat to Sarah Jessica Parker to answer.\nFrom personal dating experience, I\u2019d\nsay no. Horny people are horny cos\nthey ain\u2019t getting any. And yes, usually\nthere\u2019s a good reason why.)\nAll of this brings me back to Montmarre, in particular the Moulin Rouge,\nwhich is settled in the heart of Paris\u2019s\nred light district. Sadly, if you\u2019re looking for your own courtesan tonight,\nthen firstly you may be a few decades\ntoo late, and secondly, you\u2019ll have to\ndish out \u00a3100 to see a flash of knickers during the can-can performance.\nBut The Erotica Museum to be found\njust a g-string\u2019s throw away around\nthe corner and may well perk you up\ninstead. And this is actually a classy\nplace \u2013 white marble floors, gold ban-isters, and seven floors of penises.\nHighlights include sculptures of Chinese acrobat-style moves which puts\nthe Karma Sutra to shame, and many a\ndildo about the length of your coursework and just as fat. Don\u2019t forget the\nold style French porn \u2013one obese old\nman with two obese old women, taking\npart in various acts, all with the most\nbored expression on their faces. Well,\nif I were with two obese women or\neven one obese man then I\u2019d probably\nlook equally bored.\nMoving onto Paris\u2019s most famous\nasset \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about cel-lulite. I mean that absolutely beautiful gigantic lattice metallic structure,\npointing so proudly into the sky. Well,\nit used to have reason to be proud: it\nretained its title as the world\u2019s tallest phallic symbol until 1930. Sorry, I\nmeant tower. The title is now held by\nKiev\u2019s tower (well fair enough, Ukraine\nare still lagging with hot tourist sites,\nalthough they did win Eurovision re-cently). Tokyo Tower tries to butt in\nevery now and then by sticking its 33m\nantenna onto the end of the tower to\ntry to cover for its inferiority complex.\nHow very Japanese.\nThinking about it rationally, it seems\nridiculous to think something resembling an overgrown grey pylon should\nbe something so magnificent. Perhaps\nit is the harsh, cold, structured feel of\nthe tower, at once so striking and origi-nal, which makes it so simultaneously\nartistic and inartistic. To me, this is\nwhat lends it its charm. For the engineers of Imperial, there is an additional\nreason why the Eiffel Tower may be so\nsexy: Apparently it was built with \u201ca\nnonlinear integral differential equation\nbased on counterbalancing the wind\npressure on any point on the tower\nwith the tension between the construction elements at that point. That shape\nis exponential.\u201d Uh huh.\nSo did I mention that Paris is not\nonly sleazy-sexy but also incredibly classy-sexy? Well, I may have neglected to mention the Louvre, the\nArc de Triomphe, the Musee d\u2019Orsay\n(home to the infamous \u201cOrigin of the\nWorld\u201d painting. I dare you to google\nimage this), the Sacre-Coeur, and the\nNotre Dame in all my excitement for\nthe Erotica Museum, but I refuse to be\naccused as my advice to you is to visit\nthem all! But don\u2019t forget that a hint\nof sleaze mixed in with the class isn\u2019t\nso bad \u2013 it is after all, what gives the\nFrench their distinct charm.\nThis is one of the much tamer pieces in the collection. Printing any of\nthe other ones would probably get us in a lot of trouble\nThe Louvre: I may have neglected to mention this in my article but perhaps this picture makes up for it\n\u201cThe man\ndisplayed\nnothing except\nhis nakedness\nand his Eiffel\nTower\u201d\n\u201cMy fantastic\nfantasy of finding\na fit frenchie to\nfrolic with beside\nthe riverside\u201d\n25\nFriday 2 November 2007 felix\n\n"

As a Fresher, every morning has been just that.\nFrank Turner returns after the 2005\nbreak-up of cult band Million Dead.\nTurner embarks upon a new direction\nafter the raw post-punk ideals of two\nhighly popular albums with Million\nDead. This \u2018new\u2019 sound will be familiar to dedicated fans after Turner\u2019s solo\nacoustic sets became a solid feature\nof later Million Dead gigs. The Real\nDamage EP sees Turner preview this\nacoustic folk-sound finally in a right of\nits own.\nSea Legs and Sunshine State show a\nmuch softer, more emotional side to\nTurner\u2019s previous songwriting, whilst\nthe fifth track Heartless Bastard Motherfucker glimpses at a more familiar,\nedgier and blues-ier frame. Although\nthe combination doesn\u2019t completely\nwork as a five-track record, only the\nCherry Ghost\n4am\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nSingle Review\nTheir first album Thirst For Romance\ndebuted in the top 10 UK charts at\nnumber 7 and received outstanding\ncommendations and endorsement\nacross the board. Following a stream of\nsell-out gigs around the UK as well as\nappearances at prominent music festivals including Glastonbury and Latitude, the band is indeed relentlessly\nrecruiting new webs of fans, capturing\nboth new and old audiences with their\nunique concoction of sounds and lyr-Stephen Fretwell, singer-songwriter\nfrom Lincolnshire, is described by Q\nMagazine as 'Scunthorpe's finest ex-port... ever'. \u201cMan on the Roof\u2026 teems\nwith wit, originality, sharpness and pa-thos, with stand-out tracks including\nDarlin\u2019 Don\u2019t, Funny Hat, She and San\nFrancisco Blues. Wonderful\u201d \u2013 Sunday\nTimes Culture. Fretwell has certainly\nmatured as an artist since the release of\nMagpie, his gold-selling debut in November 04. After receiving numerous\nplaudits from the likes of NME back in\n2000, it has been a long wait for album\nnumber two. Fretwell has in the recent\nyears supported the likes of greats such\nas Oasis and Travis. He is the real deal\nas one would put it.\nHe is generally recognized music-wise for his sentimental, sombre lyrics on life, trials and tribulations, love,\npain and vocally for his gravelly deep\nvoice that conveys so much heartfelt emotion. With Bob Dylan being a\nhuge influence, its no wonder that one\nglimpse of his music and one is unas-sailably reminded of Dylan's ingenius\nhandiwork. Indulge!\nThe sweet jaunty opening number-Coney definitely makes you want to\nsway about to the music. The album\ndeclares its magic with the fairground\nsway of Coney, the story of a girl yearning to leave the fairground life but ends\nup succumbing like we all do. It's a\nbouncy, flamboyant merry-go-round\ncorker of an opener and strengthened with the \u201cboom-cha-cha-boom\u201d\nchorus.\nHis trademark is being very chilled-out and sentimental, Fretwell certainly\ncreates a world of his own. To follow\nup, the next folksy track Scar sees the\ndrums kick off with a lilting rhythm\nand accelerated pace that contrasts\nmarkedly with some of the mellow\ntracks in this fantastic array of classic\ntuneage.\nThe third track, The Ground Beneath Your Feet laments on past love,\nsuch a prevalent thing that features\nin just about anything. Those who\nhave ever broke up with a significant\nother will empathise with the somewhat poignant lyrics. We all fancy a\nbit of schmaltz from time-to-time re-ally. The interjection of a quick drum\nroll and guitar hook works a real treat\nin the middle of the song. The much\n-adored electric guitar fills the instrumental section towards the end of the\nsong which dynamically plays with the\ntexture and orchestration of this piece.\nThe syncopated guitar arrangement is\nawesome, as it manages to somehow\neffectively lift the song from total mel-ancholy. (We don\u2019t honestly want to\nput a gun to one\u2019s head in hopeless despair for crying out loud). Dead on the\nother hand, takes a more upbeat turn;\na groovy tune. The pace has turned up\na noticeable notch with the drumbeat\nbeing more prominent as the rhythm\nintensifies, providing a sense of contentedness and a tentative temporary\nsense of happiness that is ruthlessly\npervasive.\nNext, we have Funny Hat\u2019 Ta dah!\nAn absolute darling of a number. This\nbeauty laments on love, bring delivered with such delicate passion and\npathos, one evidently feels a spasm of\nincredible jealousy of Fretwell for being so damn good! The melody is ach-Stephen Fretwell\nMan on the Roof\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nAlbum Review\ningly melancholic, but nevertheless\ntruly breathtakingly emotional and the\nlyrics will resound softly in your head.\nStephen's voice conveys such tender\npassion that you cannot help but get\nteary-eyed at times. Listening closely,\nhis voice is a cross between the lead\nsinger of Athlete, Chris Martin and\nJames Morrison. Sexy and throaty. Hell\nyeah!\nThe next track San Francisco Blues\nstarts with an interesting bluesy guitar prelude. The chorus reminds one\nof the Chillies for a split second with\nthe simple quick application of arpeggios and gentle drumbeat. Guitar riffs\nare seemingly simple but take an enchanting hold. Now is equally magical,\nit impresses with a bittersweet melody\nin which the piano and guitars feature\npredominantly. The chorus sees the\ndrums start to kick back in, giving it an\nuplifting outlook. The next one lasts\nfor no more than 2 minutes. Saturday\nis somewhat gloomy and sadly not really up to the pedestal set by the rest of\nthe album.\nNinth track Bumper Cars is more\ninstrumentally based, with a violin\naccompaniment thrown in for good\nmeasure, giving it a rich, full texture.\nThe album then gives rise to She, a\nslow, easy-going tune that is backed\nup with extra vocals, soulful to be sure.\nFretwell has an uncanny way of getting songs stuck in your head all day\nlong. Sweet and melodic. Darlin Don\u2019t\nis reminiscent of Jose Gonzalez with\nits soft guitar strumming in the background and the mellowness has you\nunwinding on the sofa, daydreaming\nabout past childhood. You can happily drift to sleep listening to this little\nnumber. Once again, sombre melody\ndrift in for track twelve, Sleep, bemoaning love and all the emotional baggage\nthat it entails.\nThe penultimate tune, The Scheme,\nbegins eerily with electronic synthesised sounds which slowly creep in\nstealthily- no trace of the guitar in\nthis one. Instead, the piano triumphs\nby creating long drawn-out repeated\nchords that have you almost floating\non the clouds. This gives it a somewhat\nmystical, dreamy, surreal quality. The\nminimal, almost sparse, use of instrumentation in this track is very effective,\ndoing away with extravagant ostenta-cious soundscapes and orchestration\nto allow the fragile but altogether potent melody to do the talking.\nThe album concludes with the biz-zarely titled William Shatner's Dog.\nThe last number is highly laidback and\ncasual in the style of the guitar accom-paniment. Sadly, the finishing track\ndoes not end on a high. A return to the\nmellowness which he does best. Can\u2019t\ncomplain.\nIt\u2019s plain to see that this album really\nhas no airs and graces \u2013 it is comprised\nwholly of unpretentious song-writing\nbrought to life by Fretwell's distinctive,\nbreathtaking and altogether euphonic\nvocal and acoustic delivery.\nThere are a few minor numbers that\ndo not stand out in blinding fashion,\nbut even though you might not be\nenthralled by all the tracks, for most\nof the duration of the album, you will\nhopefully discover yourself rapt with\nattention. This collection of intimate,\nmelancholy and compelling numbers\nwill surely have you wanting more.\nEven though he is outside the main-stream, one cannot deny that he is a\ngreat, raw talent with a lot to admire.\nThankfully, his songs do not fall into\nthe category of ten-a-penny that we\nsadly seem to see in the charts. His\nsongs are interestingly meaningful and\npalpably tinged with honesty; his vocal\nrange is impressive, and his lyrics are\nostensibly confessional and memora-ble. It is so rare nowadays to find such a\njewel amongst the cheese that is ubiquitous in the mass commercial music\nmarket these days. I digress.\nOver the 14 tracks, Fretwell alludes\nto heartache, jadedness, nostalgia, regret and loneliness. This album is just\nstunning, it is simply perfect for the\nimminent long, dark, winter nights. A\ntime-less repertoire. Lights out, let the\nfire crackle on and fill the room with\nthese beautifully haunting melodies.\nDylan fans, here\u2019s something for you.\nWatch out though, Fretwell may well\nusurp him one day!\nSusan Yu\nics, heavenly heartrending and always\nbeautifully evocative.\n4am is the third single from Manchester-based Cherry Ghost. Their\nmusic is heavily inspired by the sublime melancholy of acts such as Smog,\nJohnny Cash and Sparklehorse. Their\nprevious hit anthemic single People\nHelp The People is still hot property\nreverberating everywhere with its radio omnipresence. Simon Aldred, the\nmain singer-songwriter does seem to\nhave a knack of knocking out tunes\nthat are euphonic to our ears, both\nmusically and lyrically of course.\nThis track begins with a fusion of\nelectronic sounds which steadily leads\ninto a gentle melodic intro, setting the\nmood to a relaxing time out. It\u2019s always good to come back from a hard\nday\u2019s slog, put one\u2019s feet up and listen\nto something like this whilst drinking\nhot chocolate. Very sweet and mellow,\nwith the acoustic guitar playing pleasantly and shaping the simplistic chord\nstructure. The wistful, almost nostalgic feel emanates not just from the soft\ncrooning quality of the singing and the\npeaceful guitar strumming but also\naugmented by the lyrics: 'There ain't\nno hiding place on Earth that loneliness ain't been first'. The pace is nice\nand laidback giving you plenty of time\nto feel the stress of the day seeping out\nof one\u2019s pores.\nThis little gem of a song is reminiscent of a sweet night time stroll, tinged\nby the loneliness that is forever prevalent throughout life. Indeed there is\nsome slight resemblance to Newton\nFaulkner, who also broke into the music scene quite recently with a similar\nstyle of the guitar backdrop laced with\nthe easy laid-back singing. It is definitely worth considering playing this\nalbum whilst cooking a simple meal\nor doing some light reading. Cherry\nGhost are, without a doubt, a rare find\nwith their atmospheric repertoire of\nsongs. I\u2019m sure they are destined for\nbigger and better things, ascent is the\nonly way up!\nSusan Yu\nopening track The Real Damage makes\nit onto Turner\u2019s full album Sleep Is For\nThe Week. Despite this, the quality of\nthe song writing is ubiquitously top\nnotch throughout the five tracks. Vocal\nwise, gone are the days of throat-rip-ping, hundred-mile-per-hour scream-ing; replaced by a greatly measured\nand melodic integrity.\nIt\u2019s definitely not Million Dead, but\nthat can only be a good thing for Turner. It\u2019s definitely more accessible to a\nwider audience then his previous musical endeavours, but it may suffer from\nthe size of his record label, Xtra Mile,\ncoupled with his relative anonymity.\nHardcore but fickle MD fans may follow Turner\u2019s latest efforts with initial\ndedication but move on once they realise they can\u2019t thrash their heads along\nto it. But you wouldn\u2019t want to thrash\nany of your members along to Frank\nTurner\u2019s material. Calmly tapping your\nfoot will do just fine.\nDaniel Wan\nClockwise from top left: Stephen Fretwell in the studio, Frank Turner enjoying some \u201cme\u201d time and Cherry\nGhost\u2019s Simon Aldred looking pensive. Nice shirt to be fair to him. Not sure about the window decor though\n\n"

The NUS claimed that\nwe \u201chave lost the argument for state-funded higher education with the public\u201d and we must \u201cfocus our efforts on\nkeeping the cap on fees and not let the\nfight for free education make us ineffective and destroy our chances of winning on the issue of the cap.\u201d\nFor a Union that was so worried last\nyear about Imperial no longer forming policy independent of the NUS, we\nseem to be reversing our policy on HE\nfunding precisely because the NUS is\ndoing so. Just because our Union has\naffiliated to the NUS it does not mean\nwe have to adopt precisely the same\nposition as them.\nOur Union President, along with\nthe NUS, thinks that the debate has\nmoved on. By their logic we must accept that there has to be a market in\nhigher education and all we can do is\nlimit it. However, there has not always\nbeen a market in Higher Education.\nPrior to the introduction of tuition fees\nin 1998 everyone received a grant to go\nto university.\nIf our policy was aimed at trying to\nstop the cap being lifted on the basis\nthat paying \u00a33000 is the best we\u2019re going to get, then all we do is weaken our\nposition. The Union seems to believe\nthat maintaining an \u201cunrealistic\u201d - but\nprincipled - stance on free education\nwill weaken the ability of ICU and NUS\nto prevent the \u00a33,000 cap from being\nlifted. In fact the reverse is correct. If\nICU doesn\u2019t retain its support for free\neducation, then any future argument\nagainst increasing the cap loses its\nlogical basis; if we accept the need for\nthe free market to dictate who attends\nuniversity then our Rector\u2019s position\nin favour of unlimited top-up fees is\none that becomes almost impossible\nto resist.\nTactically we need to keep our current policy if we are to win the argument in a couple of years when the\ngovernment reviews top-up fees. If we\nallow Universities to be subject to the\nfree market then they will constantly\nbe competing to increase fees. Sir Richard Sykes and other members of the\nRussell Group make it clear that they\nwould like to charge unlimited fees.\nWe must maintain our support for free\neducation (that is free at the point of\nuse) in order to avoid this situation.\nI hope the Union Council will clarify\ntheir position with regards to releasing\nthe cap on top-up fees. Will the Union\nrobustly oppose increasing the cap on\ntop-up fees when this issue comes to\nprominence in 2009?\nThe President\u2019s simplistic argument\nthat the only opposition to top-up fees\nis because people \u201cprefer something\nfree over something you have to now\npay for\u201d ignores the reality in which\npoorer people are excluded from attending University out of fear of the\nresulting debt.\nAlthough the overall number of admissions did not change much after\nthe introduction of top-up fees, it is\nnot clear just how much people from\nthe poorest backgrounds have been deterred from going to university. I only\nmanaged to come to Imperial because\nI obtained one of four scholarships, as\nmy parents can not afford to contribute anything to my tuition fees. I only\ndecided to come to university because\nunder the old system of means-tested\nbenefits I was exempt from paying\ntuition fees, which took away a lot of\nworry about debt after graduation. I\ncan testify to the effect that top-up\nfees would have had on me: I would\nnot have come to University, let alone\nImperial.\nUnder the current system students\nfrom poorer backgrounds will end up\ncoming out of university with much\nlarger amounts of debt than before\ntop-up fees were introduced as their\nparents will not be able to contribute\ntowards their tuition fees. Although\nnew bursaries have been introduced a\nlot of the time this has been done at the\nexpense of old ones. For example the\nscholarship I was awarded by Imperial\nCollege is now \u00a31000 per annum for\nnew students as opposed to \u00a35000 per\nannum 2 years ago.\nIf we change our policy on HE funding we will be agreeing to the exclusion\nof students from low income back-grounds, which is something that we\ndon\u2019t want to do.\nThe title of the previous article by\nthe President, \u201cThe Union\u2019s View\u201d, was\nerroneous, as it is clearly only the view\nof those people on Union Council who\nvoted for the HE Funding Policy to be\nrevoked, not all the members of the\nUnion. I renew my call for a full referendum of the student body to decide\nthis critical issue.\nCaroline Clark\nSteve Brown\nPresident\n\u201c\nIf we allow\nuniversities to\nbe subject to\nthe free market\nthen they will\nconstantly be\ncompeting to\nincrease fees\n\u201d\nContinuing the education debate\nComment returns to the discussion about what the Union\u2019s stance on higher education funding should be\nH\nas anyone heard the\njoke about how many\nsabbaticals it takes to\nwin the \u201cfight\u201d for free\neducation? Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I am deadly serious. This time\nlast year only eight of you responded\nto the rallying cry of the then Deputy\nPresident (Education and Welfare) to\nattend a national demonstration in\nCentral London to register your disgust with the current education funding arrangements.\nTo respond to some of the other\ncontributors to these esteemed pages\nI would like to clarify that at no point\nhas myself, Union Council or even the\nRector has recently put forward the\nidea that our education should be entirely \u201cself funded\u201d.\nUnion Council voted to scrap our\npolicy on free education as they acknowledged that it is no longer a realistic stance to take given that the\ngovernment is now aiming for 50% of\nall school leavers to embark upon a\ndegree course. If you believe that the\ntaxpayer should pick up the tab for this\nexercise then you better start formulating a proposal that will find favour\nwith the leadership of either of the two\nmain political parties. If I really wanted\nto I could use this column to sanctimoniously scaremonger on this topic but\ngiven that less than 0.1% of the student\nbody attended the last National Demo\nI will take this opportunity to put a different view across.\nTo respond to Ms. Clark who was\nat odds with my view in issue 1,383 I\nwould like to give her a bit of a reality check. She correctly points out that\na Students\u2019 Union has to \u201cdefend the\ninterests of students\u201d but to do so we\nneed to engage with society on what\nexactly constitutes the \u201cinterests\u201d of\ncurrent and potential students. Ms.\nClark seems to be suggesting that the\nUnion should embark on a self-defeat-ing internal monologue on this topic.\nThere is no point in convincing\nUnion Council, the NUS or even the\nstudent body via a general meeting or\nreferendum about the merits of \u201cfree\neducation\u201d if you cannot convince anyone else. Whilst the Union held a policy mandating officers to toe the free\neducation line I am confident in saying that we would probably get taken\nabout as seriously as doctors would be\nif they asked for a 100% pay rise. The\nabolition of the graduate contribution\nis a position that both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party do\nnot support and if you want to change\ntheir mind it will take considerably\nmore than sending eight people along\nto wave placards in the air and offering\na couple of ill thought out arguments\nin the pages of Felix .\nAs I have stated in these pages previ-ously, even the phrase \u201cfree education\u201d\nis a complete misnomer. Education\nis not free and someone, somewhere\nhas to pay for it and there is little to\nbe gained from me sanctimoniously\nscaremongering that if there is no\nmechanism for a graduate contribution then society would be worse off.\nI would like to point out that higher\neducation still is free at the point of\nuse. All EU students repay their fees\nvia the student loans company. The\namount they pay back is dependent on\nhow much you earn and currently the\ngovernment subsidises the interest on\nstudent loans.\nCurrently I am over \u00a320,000 in debt\nbut if I was given a lump sum tomorrow\nI would be better off financially if I put\nthat money in a savings account rather\nthan using it to pay off my student loan\nearly. The introduction of student fees\nhas also seen the reintroduction of\nbursaries. If I was a bit younger and\nstarted university now I would qualify\nfor a grant. Is Ms. Clark going to argue\nin favour of a system whereby financial\nsupport can\u2019t be targeted at students\nwho need it the most? Would she\nbe in favour of an alternative system\nwhereby contributions paid by Imperial graduates would be used to support \u201cstudents\u201d studying Surf Science\nor Golf Course Management?\nStudent debt is not like credit card\ndebt. There is no incentive to pay what\nyou owe back any quicker than the government asks. Professor Nicholas Barr\nat the LSE illustrated this by stating the\nfact that a graduate earning \u00a315,000\npays nothing but a graduate earning\n\u00a350,000 would repay their loan at the\nrate of \u00a3262.50 per month. Higher Education is free at the point of use and it\nis only once you start earning that you\ncan afford to pay for it. The only alternative is to argue that we should all pay\nmore in tax once we graduate to cover\nthe cost but given that neither political parties are in favour of significant\ntax increases this is unlikely to happen.\nImperial College graduates command\nsome of the highest starting salaries so\nis it really in our members interest to\nargue for this?\nIf students are that unhappy with\nthe system or if any evidence emerges\nthat fees have had a negative impact on\naccess to Imperial College then I will\nbe the first to man the barricades. It is\ncrucial that Union policy is based on\nhow things actually are rather than it\nbeing formulated around few cheap\nslogans about \u201cfree education\u201d. If you\nwant to suggest an alternative to the\ncurrent graduate contribution where\nthere are significantly increased levels\nof support for low income students\nand that all the money paid by Imperial students stays with Imperial College I will be all ears. Until then please\nremember that if you abolish fees you\nwill also abolish targeted financial support for the students who need it most.\nIf the student body wants their most\nsenior representative to make a case\nin favour of this then there has to be\nmore evidence of this than the views\nof the eight students who went marching through the streets of London last\nautumn.\n\u201c\nEducation\nis not free\nand someone,\nsomewhere has\nto pay for it\nFree higher education is unrealistic\n\n"

This would have been the obvious solution for most of human history\nand effective too, as it harnesses a total\nbelief system of the sort we evolved to\nlive with. Chronic meat shortage has\nplayed a fascinating role in shaping\nsome of the more bizarre religious be-liefs. Hopefully we can avoid the experience of Ancient Mexico where, lacking the large game of Africa and Asia,\nmeat became exclusive to the ruling\nAztec classes whilst at times commoners had to make do with the spirulina-algaeskimmedfromLakeTexcoco.The\nsolution was to cannibalise the victims\nof human sacrifice \u2013 as many as fifteen\nthousand people per year. The priesthood said that human sacrifice was\napproved by the high gods, and\nthey sanctified it with elaborate\nrituals performed amid statuary of the gods on imposing\nwhite temples.\nSo let\u2019s do a little experiment\non ourselves. Say somebody is\nsuggesting you eat less meat,\nhow does this make you feel?\nSelf righteous like you would need\nacknowledgement? And if nobody\nwould ever know your choice? Like\nyou want to rebel and have more\nfor yourself because you feel you\ndeserve it as you are a winner?\nIrrespective of how we consciously or\nsub-consciously justify it to ourselves,\nsomewhere in that psychology is what\nis known as the Tragedy of the ComIn light of the increasing awareness of the meat industry\u2019s bad environmental credentials, Noel Forrest\nexplores the virtues of meat and dairy-free eating.

Because the costs of your actions are diffuse and spread across\nmany others (i.e. the negative impacts\nof climate change, mainly affecting the\npoor) but the benefits of your actions\nare personal, people decide to overuse\nresources to the\npoint of\ncollapse.\nHowever much\nphilosophi-Basic Tomato Sauce\nSome vegetarian recipes to cleanse your meat-riddled conscience\nThis looks like an exact recipe but\nalmost any veg will do, and the cous\ncous does not need to be so fancy.\n500g cous cous\n750 ml boiling water\n1/2 tsp bouillon powder (or crushed\nstock cube)\n1tbsp oliveoil\n1 onion diced\n1 tsp mustard seeds\n1 garlic clove crushed\nsalt and pepper\n1 red pepper cut into 6\n1 yellow pepper cut into 6\n1 bulb fennel cut into 6\n2 med courgettes cut into 5 cm chunks\non diagonal\n3 red onions peeled ,cut into 6\n2 med aubergines cut into 5cm\nchunks\n4 tbsp olive oil\ndash tabasco\n1tbsp balsamic vinegar\n1 clove garlic crushed\nsalt and pepper\n1.

With apologies to\nthe academic disciplines skipped\ngenetic heritage when you ask why we\ndo anything we do in the first place.\nSeeking status and having children,\nsport, religion, altruism, aggression,\nphobias, all our most intense emotions\u2026 in my opinion our lives are\nscreaming out our evolutionary history and it gives me a huge kick to see\nthat so clearly, when I know that others\ndon\u2019t.\nAs a minor aside, am I really the only\none with an internal dialogue of constant judgment? I would go so far as to\nsay that it is basically what it means to\nbe a human \u2013 expressionlessly choosing the best course of action, while our\nminds are swirling though various options and calculating the self-interest\nfactor. A human face is a poker face\n\u2013 we do or say one thing, and think\nsomething completely different. I say\nthat we are selfish, no matter how we\njustify it to ourselves or what we think\nof ourselves, and reason follows passion anyway.\nOf course we shouldn\u2019t fight this, as\nit is our nature, and we have nowhere\nelse to go, but how can we break that\ncircularity for the necessary preservation of our environment? Maybe that\u2019s\nwhy government regulation needs to\nplay a part \u2013 but that\u2019s short sighted\ntoo through the four-year term system\nwhich forces excessive voter pander-ing. In my view, the answer is tribal-ism. We need to recapture those spirits\nin a system of branding and labelling\nupon which, as a group, we can heap\nmoral significance and push the conformity onwards, providing that acknowledgement and recognition we\nall seek. What about corruption? Can\u2019t\nwe design a system around that? It\u2019s\nnot enough to rely on good people, we\nknow people are conniving and deceitful (sorry to say!) so we need it to be\nacceptable to check our neighbours\nare in line if we all did this it would be\nfine. Why isn\u2019t it acceptable for us all\nto invade our neighbours\u2019 privacy and\ncheck they\u2019re not making bombs in\ntheir attics? That\u2019s a pretty dark question in my view, and an important one\ntoo.\nWell actually, there is one place\nwhere it happens every day and it\u2019s also\nthe place where most meat is bought.\nIt\u2019s the supermarket. Oh, how the\nhousewife frets over her see-through\nbasket! Are those chocolate biscuits\npeeking out between the wires just too\nnaughty? Should I have really gone for\norganic muesli? It\u2019s the perfect exam-ple! And Grannies are the exception\nthat proves the rule. They\u2019ve garnered\nrespect and so can get away with their\ntartan fabric trolleys, and fill them up\nwith dog food and hairspray. But here\u2019s\nmy point: we need more see-through\nbaskets in our lives and we need to be\nseen to be putting the right things in\nthem. Follow some of the meat-free\nrecipes on this page and you\u2019ll be on\nthe right track, plus you won\u2019t have\nto eat dog food; for while this may be\nequally cost-effective, I fear it may also\nexplain a fair portion of all those tartan\ntrolleys.\n\u201cThe solution\nto chronic meat\nshortage was to\ncannibalise the\nvictims of human\nsacrifice\u201d\nin between, our\nmoral compass is\nshort-sightedinthe\nself interest of our\ngenes. We only tend\nto look a few generations into the future (before\nour own genome will become\nfragmented in successive halv-ings) and we make selective altruism\ntowards our closest kin, with whom\nwe share most genes (I\u2019m thinking of\nChristmas presents), or make altruism\nin expectation of reciprocation.\nIt\u2019s easy to see the relevance of our\n4. For the roasted veg, mix all the veg\nwith olive oil, tabasco, balsamic vin-egar, garlic and salt and pepper and\nplace in an oven-proof dish.

Louis Bachelier, a young mathe-matician, was the first person to bridge\nthe gap between the two worlds that are\nseemingly at odds. He achievied this by\npublishing his \u201cTheory of Speculation\u201d\nin 1900. Much theory now abounds\nand many times it borrows ideas from\nthe most unlikely places. From physics and mathematics to what can only\nbe described as cheap mail-order psychology courses.\nMany speculators, good and bad\nalike, have written extensively about\ntrading over the last century. The famous Jesse Livermore and the infamous currency breaker extraordinaire,\nGeorge Soros, are perfect examples.\nThey have all shared some of their\nviews and doctrines on trading with\nmasses of eager, hungry, foolishly uneducated buffoons.\nNone of their ideas are truly original\nor propose the reader undergo radical changes of thought in an absolute\nplan. It is however, quite interesting to\nto see how they are metamorphosed\nand adapted to the highly volatile commercial plane \u2013 especially the financial\nmicrocosm.\nWhile most authors present relatively different topics and ideas from one\nanother, each of their texts contains a\nfew links that connect their supposed\nwisdom to someone else\u2019s philosophy\n\u2013 be it merely of speculation or life in\ngeneral. It is obviously possible to\nextrapolate these beyond common sense and identify a\nplethora of associations that\nmight not really be there in\nthe first place.\nIf, on the other hand, one\nis familiar with some of the\nmore widespread ideas about\ntrading, one can quite easily synthesize and identify a\nfew key ideas, placing them under four loose (almost esoteric)\nheadings:\n\u2022 The relationship between\nconfidence and humility\n\u2022 Self-perception\n\u2022 Discipline and authority\nand most importantly,\n\u2022 The human condition\nThere is something to be\nsaid about the attributes\nof a good speculator.\nNo one trader will\nhave all the desirable traits for a\nsuccessful career\nin the industry. It\nis likely however,\nthat a prosperous trader has\na few highly\ndominant\nones and is\nThe mindset of a ninja and the audacity of a thai prostitute on a bad night out are prerequisites for trading\nAfonso Campos\nBusiness Editor\nable to dominate and reduce exposure\nto his weakest.\nConfidence and humility\nThis is a relatively tricky one. Most\nof the greatest traders of all time agree\nthat one of the main traits moulding a\ngood speculator, is a relatively high level of confidence, sprinkled with a good\ndose of humility. By this, I mean having the conviction of putting on a trade\nand opening a position without the arrogance of taking too much risk. This\nis an idea that is seen in most trading\ntheories \u2013 either in an abstract way\nwhere it is only implied, or in a more\nnarrative and pedagogical sense where\nthe author might tell a story of how a\ngrave lack of balance between hubris\nand serenity has led to a devastating\nloss. In a way, an excess of confidence\non the money manager\u2019s part can be\nseen where he/she is no longer curious\nabout every little detail of the trade. As\nsoon as all the questions cease, there is\na serious flaw in execution that will in\nsome way, lead to a loss.\nSelf-perception\nHaving a good idea of who we are, how\nwe work and what our strong and weak\npoints are, is absolutely vital for specu-lation. It is postulated by a majority of\ninvestors that beginning speculators\nand trad- ers fail\nand\nsuffer\nmassive losses\ndue to a lack\nof self-knowl-edge or an incredibly high\ndegree of difficulty in\naccepting\ncharacter\nflaws and\novercoming these.\nTrading\nhistory tells\nus the story of\ncountless traders who firmly\nbelieve their gains\nare a by-product\nof their intelligence\nexclusively and that\nno external conditions\nhave come into play. This\ncompletely alters their\nbehaviour and mindset\nin the financial markets\nand, thinking themselves\ninvincible, they almost inevitably fall in a tragic manner,\nworthy of an epic poem. A\nreluctance of acceptance of\nour relative inferiority to\nalmost perfectly behaving\nmarkets leads to results\nthat fall short of most\nexpectations.\nDiscipline and\nAuthority\nFor exterior reasons,\nmost traders, even\nsuccessful ones have\ndiscipline problems\nand flaws. As long as\nthese issues are very\nsporadic and somewhat minor, it is almost acceptable to\nerr; one does after all learn from mis-takes. A grave lack of discipline how-ever, will most likely lead to a downfall of character, or most importantly\nin speculation, positive alpha. When\na speculator opens a position he/she\nmust know exactly why this is being\ndone. Many beginning traders howev-er, seem to be completely disconnected\nfrom this notion of discipline and seem\nblinded by their own accidental suc-cess. It is suggested by veterans that\nnewbies should take a relatively systemic approach to their trading, where\ntheir criterion are validated by more\nthan one metric.\nSome traders are also of the camp\nthat one cannot do everything alone\nand still beat the benchmarks and\nhence, delegation of authority is a\nmust. This stems from a good manager\nhaving the discipline to recognise that\nhuman beings, while good at multi-tasking, will over time have diminishing returns if the work they do increases almost exponentially. Success at this\nstage depends on the choice of people\naccording to competencies.\nThe Human Condition\nThe most abstract idea is without a\ndoubtthemostwidespreadandprevail-ing one in any theory of speculation. It\ndeals with the deepest emotions felt by\ntraders during market hours. Any speculator is almost completely overtaken\nby the primordial emotions of fear and\ngreed. It makes for an interesting study\nto observe the shifting focus of these\nduring the day, and what factors other\nthan market activity, make the balance\ntilt from one end of the spectrum to\nthe other. A concept that is usually perceived to have a negative influence on\nhuman beings is that of social and peer\npressure. In the financial markets, this\nbecomes a very important part of performing well. It is inevitable to benchmark oneself against a peer group. In\na strangely Darwinist survival-of-the-fittest scenario when this group is doing well as a whole, it is only normal\nthat one wants to perform at the same\nlevel or better to everyone else.\nAnd that is all that markets are about.\nThe perpetual quest to be the best; to\nknow you are on the winning side of a\ntrade; to know your view is superior to\nthat of a million other players; to assert\nyourself as the leader of the pack.\nVeni, vidi, vici... suckers.\n\u201cA good\nspeculator\ndominates his\nweak character\ntraits and flaws\u201d\nTop, floor traders waiting to ride the bull. Bottom, the bull waiting to be ridden by the floor traders\n\n"

Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDavid Paw\nArts Editor\nI\nwas thinking about art the\nother day. I thought about what\nit constituted, its many definitions and the lack of definition\nthat it ultimately had in its current form. Which is by no means a bad\nthing. Art is broad, should be broad,\nand defined by the individual.\nWe all have our own ideas of what\nconstitutes \u201cart\u201d, falling into aesthetic\ndefinitions and ideals, and schools of\nthought \u2013 self-expression and so forth.\nThough most if not all, would agree\non The Establishment, everyone else\nfights and disagrees about Jake and\nDinos Chapman, splatter paintings, interpretative dance and mime.\nThough the merits of more vague,\nless accepted endeavours are less well\nappreciated, they are by no means less\nvalid as systems of thought or creative\noutlets. We will always struggle to define our environment through creative\nand artistic mediums.\nAs crazy as it may appear at times,\nthe risk-takers and the unafraid are\nultimately the ones asking the questions and challenging what we think\nwe know, what we think we want, our\nperceptions of beauty and indeed, what\nconstitutes \u201cart\u201d.\nWhy is there so much detritus in\nmodern art at the moment? Who\nknows. There could have been as much\ndebris in previous eras \u2013 but all we\u2019ve\nbeen presented with, and all that has\nbeen talked about has already been es-tablished. The best and the definitive\n\u2013 they already did away with all the\ncrap. Even Banksy is cashing in at major auction houses \u2013 who\u2019s to say the\nintelligentsia won\u2019t be speaking about\nhim with high airs given time?\nSimilarly, there are still some who\nbelieve that art is a bowl of fruit and\nstill life. Clearly not you \u2013 you\u2019re reading Felix Arts, after all \u2013 but that is the\nother end of the spectrum. Somewhere\nalong the way, architecture is still discredited as a viable art form, and they\nare not entirely wrong \u2013 essentially designing structures for clients does not\nseem highly glamorous or definitive of\ncreative endeavour.\nBut conversely, at the zenith of the\ncraft is the best architecture, that most\ncomplicated of art forms. The conception of a striking yet functional structure that has to be able to be appreciated by those perhaps not that way\ninclined day in, day out, within the\nconstraints of a client\u2019s personal taste,\nbudget, and the intricacies of other\nreal-world guidelines.\nWhich brings me to this week\u2019s issue\n\u2013 heavy on the architecture, and justifiably so, with fourth-wall-removed\nmime thrown in for good measure,\ncourtesyofEmilySteele\u2013checkouther\nreview of the impressive production of\nBehind The Mirror at the hidden gem\nthat is the Blue Elephant Theatre. Caz\nKnight gets to grips with an emotionally charged production of War Horse,\nfinding there\u2019s more to puppetry than\nlukewarm seaside shows.\nA little less conversation?\nEmily Steel is transfixed by one of London theatreland\u2019s concealed gems\nA\nyoung man prepares to\npropose to his girlfriend.\nHe shaves, he flosses his\nteeth, he squeezes a spot.\nHe checks himself out in\nthe full-length mirror, and is pleased\nwith what he sees. He practises getting down on one knee and pulling a\nring from his pocket. He lays the table\nfor dinner. He straightens the plates.\nHe lights a candle in the centre of the\ntable. And when his back is turned,\nhis reflection comes through the mirror to steal his woman and ruin all his\nplans\u2026\nBehind the Mirror is the first UK\nproduction from Theatre Ad Infinitum, a new company formed by recent\ngraduates of the Jacques Lecoq theatre\nschool in Paris. The Lecoq school specialises in physical theatre, storytelling\nthrough movement. It has a reputation\nfor rigorous training and for producing\nimpressively skilled and creative per-formers. Behind the Mirror is further\nevidence that this reputation is thoroughly well deserved.\nThe performance space at the Blue\nElephant Theatre is kept almost bare.\nThere is a blue frame on wheels that\nstands in for a mirror. Other than\nthis, there is no set, and there are no\nprops. The physical world of the play\nis imaginary, entirely created by the actors \u2013 George Mann, Deborah Pugh,\nand James Turpin \u2013 who remain on\nstage at all times. Through gesture and\nsound they conjure up doors, walls,\ntables, telephones, cigarette lighters, a\nmachine gun, an electric shock. They\nspeed up time and they slow it down.\nWhen they speak, it is nonsense lan-guage, but through it they convey anxi-ety, a desire to please, indecision, the\npleasure of wickedness, and the awful\nemptiness of loss.\nA word about the Blue Elephant\nTheatre. It is tucked down an unlikely\nstreet in Camberwell. The nearest tube\nis Oval, and it\u2019s a fair walk from the sta-tion. The theatre has a map on its web-site, which is lucky, because it would\nbe tough to find without one. But it\u2019s\nworth making the effort, because this\nis a hidden gem. The venue is welcom-ing, with a good-sized black box theatre and a friendly bar, and the show is\nnothing short of delightful.\nIt\u2019s a simple story: boy loves girl, boy\nloses girl to his own reflection, boy\nenters alternative dimension on the\nother side of the mirror and fights his\nreflection to win back his love. It has\nmime, clowning, slapstick, pratfalls, a\ngood-hearted hero, a spirited heroine\nand a delicious villain. It is inventive,\nirreverent, charming and funny. It is\nalso surprisingly moving and fundamentally human.\nFrom the moment it begins, the audience is captivated. There is no \u2018fourth\nwall\u2019 in this production \u2013 the actors\nacknowledge and engage with us, and\nso we too play a part in the illusion.\nWhen the young man\u2019s evil reflection\nsteals the candle off the table, he hands\nit to a man in the front row. Finding\nthe candle missing, the young man retrieves it. In the time in between, the\nman in the front row keeps a careful\nhold on his piece of invisible wax. It\nspeaks volumes.\nThe performances are precise, committed and generous. George Mann,\nalso who directed and conceived the\nshow, is particularly talented. He plays\nthe young man with a vulnerability\nthat lends pathos to the comedy, and\nhis technical ability is remarkable. He\ndoes extraordinary things with sound:\nwhen he polishes the plates before laying them on the table, he makes them\nsqueak, and in this tiny detail he lets\nus know how clean they are, and what\nkind of quality the china is. After a fall,\nhe stands, gives a lopsided grin and lets\nout a little whistle, and we see the bluebirds fly round his head.\nAt we sat down in the theatre, my\nfriend Susannah said, \u201cI hate mime.\u201d\nBy the time it was over, she was con-verted. This production is wonderful.\nThey say it lasts an hour but it feels as\nif it flies by in about twenty minutes. I\ncould have watched it all again. I will\nlook forward to Theatre Ad Infinitum\u2019s\nnext show. They\u2019re a young company\nto watch.\nTheatre Ad Infinitum\u2019s Behind\nthe Mirror is running at the Blue\nElephant Theatre, Camberwell,\nuntil 10th November.

Why such a big deal? In contrast to the cop-out of the Diana Memorial, the Pavilion is always an interesting prospect, generating the attention of some venerable names \u2013 Toyo\nIto, Daniel Libeskind (architect of the new Freedom Tower in Manhattan) and Rem Koolhaas have\nall contributed their energies in previous years. In July 2007, Zaha Hadid contributed her second\ndesign to the ever-changing Pavilion in partnership with civil engineering firm Arup, shaping\nquite beautiful lily pad-like structures that glowed in the darkness.

After\nthat it\u2019s nothing but a de-light; yet again the National\nTheatre has delivered. Of course, the\nNational can\u2019t take all the credit! Your\nattention is first drawn to a large white\ncrack hanging above the stage- highly\nreminiscent of the Tate Modern\u2019s current exhibition. The only difference is\nno shit comes out of this crack!\nWar Horse is the story of the First\nWorld War from the viewpoint of a\nhorse. I didn\u2019t have any inkling of how\nsuch a concept would be conveyed and\nwhether it would successfully captivate\nan audience \u2013 would it be experimental theatre? Of the rubbish kind?\nKicking off in 1912 in Devon, we see\nJoey, the starring stallion (then a mere\nfoal) being bought in a rural market\nsquare. He falls into the hands of Albert- a young boy who quickly forms\na strong bond with Joey. Once Joey is\ngrown, the thought of losing him coerces Albert into training him into a\nplough horse in 7 days. Albert and Joey\nsucceed but their efforts have been in\nvain as, come 1914, Joey is sent off to\nwar. The uncertainty of Joey\u2019s whereabouts drives Albert mad with worry\nuntil he runs away to join the army to\nfind him.\nExpecting a play about war from the\nword go, the initial scenes exploring the\nblossoming relationship between horse\nand man lack substance and direction\nwith the occasional sappy emotional\nmoment thrown in for good measure\nto appeal to half term audiences.\nFast forward past these scenes and\nwe\u2019re thrown into a production which\namazes on both sentimental and technical levels.\nThe first thing that is striking and\nnovel about the play is the way in\nwhich Joey is brought to life. Three\npeople manipulate a wooden puppet\nhorse to an uncannily real effect- the\nmannerisms identical to a live horse.\nThe puppet itself bore a resemblance\nto a Trojan horse (rather apt given the\ntheme of war) and also the steed of a\nBlack Rider from the Lord of The Rings\nfilms.\nGiven the play\u2019s title, I was a little worried the play would centre too\nmuch on the horse\u2019s actions. If any-thing, Joey\u2019s role took a back seat while\nother issues prevailed. The futility of\nwar was highlighted with British and\nGerman troops flipping a coin in no\nman\u2019s land for Joey. The horrors suffered during the First World War were\npoignantly actualized, with some grizzly effects and scenes at times. War and\npeace were juxtaposed, with a scene\nset back in war-devoid Devon going on\nwhile the dead bodies from the previous scene were still strewn over the\nstage. One thing I admired was how\nthe play successfully portrayed the\nNational Pride that would have been\npresent at the time; something which\nis utterly absent in today\u2019s highly indifferent Britain and something which I\nhope changes.\nThere were definitely moments\nwhere I felt the tears prickling my\neyes, which was often brought about\nby the music. Accordion sounds were\npaired with beautiful old English folk\nsongs and evoked a lot of emotion and\npathos.\nHowever, War Horse is not always\nheavy going; just the right amount of\nhumour is added without detracting\nfrom the gravity of other issues, but\nkeeps the audience from getting too\nupset from some of the other serious\nelements of the play. Animal rights activists be warned that there are several\nscenes with enactments of animal bru-tality. I am in no way condoning animal\ncruelty but in the current climate of\npolitical correctness and not wanting\nto offend anyone in the slightest, it was\nrefreshing to see something controver-sial- also bold of the producers knowing that the play would attract a young\naudience.\nFrom a technical side, I thought\nit could get no better than those astounding puppets. I was proven wrong\nas, towards the end and the climax of\nboth the war and the play, the Olivier\u2019s\nrotating stage was impressively lifted\nto create the illusion of trenches. The\ncolossal tank that makes an entrance is\nterrifying indeed.\nAny of you who have either read or\nseen productions of Journey\u2019s End by\nR.C. Sherriff will adore this, and even\nif you haven\u2019t you are guaranteed a delightful evening.\nthe boys i mean are not refined\nthey go with girls who buck and bite\nthey do not give a fuck for luck\nthey hump them thirteen times a night\none hangs a hat upon her tit\none carves a cross on her behind\nthey do not give a shit for wit\nthe boys i mean are not refined\nthey come with girls who bite and buck\nwho cannot read and cannot write\nwho laugh like they would fall apart\nand masturbate with dynamite\nthe boys i mean are not refined\nthey cannot chat of that and this\nthey do not give a fart for art\nthey kill like you would take a piss\nthey speak whatever\u2019s on their mind\nthey do whatever\u2019s in their pants\nthe boys i mean are not refined\nthey shake the mountains when they dance\nT\nhis month\u2019s highly mature\npoem comes courtesy of\ncrazed literary giant e e\ncummings. For the folks\nwho aren\u2019t so familiar\nwith the man, cummings (always written lower case, no full stops) was one\nof the 20th century\u2019s most unconventional yet popular poets.\nBorn Edward Estlin Cummings in\nCambridge, MA, Cummings started\nwriting poetry at the age of 10 before\ntreading the hallowed halls at Harvard\nand rooming with John Dos Passos\n(American, writer, terrific) and labour-ing over the college paper with S. Foster Damon (critic, academic, all-round\nsmart person).\nInfluenced by national predecessors\nGertrude Stein and Ezra Pound (writ-ers, poets, also awesome), cummings\ndelivered a controversial commencement address entitled \u201cThe New Art\u201d\n\u2013 he was subsequently chastised by the\npress.\nAlso interesting is the fact he was\narrested and detained on suspicion of\nespionage, and subsequently flitted\nbetween Paris and New York, meeting\namongst others, Pablo Picasso.\nHe then travelled throughout the Soviet Union and the rest of the world (as\none does). Hence, in addition to relative frolics such as the imaginatively\ntitled \u201cThe Boys I Mean Are Not Refined\u201d (right), he also published a lot of\nanti-American poetry.\nBut he didn\u2019t just stop there \u2013 he\nhas also written heartfelt and ethereal\nsonnets and romantic poetry, much of\nwhich was in his spaced, oddly abbreviated and broken avant-garde style.\nOdd, but accessible and often with\nwry humour, they are the perfect antidote to the overwrought and tiresome,\nyet more directly relatable than some\nof the Beat Generation\u2019s more kooky\nwritings. What\u2019s not to like?\ncummings spent the last years of his\ndays travelling, getting paid to speak\nand spending time at his ranch in New\nHampshire.\nThe return of the Mystical Potato Head.

While I\u2019m not sure how\ntrue the story is, it illustrates the point\nthat the body is continually undergoing a process of cells dying and being\nmade\nSo what are we making these new\ncells with? The stuff we eat everyday\nof course!\nThe process of your body recover-ing, repairing and getting fitter due to\nyour hard work in the gym will be significantly increased by having the right\npost workout meal \u2013 whether you\u2019re\nsweating it out on the treadmill, working \u2018the guns\u2019 in the free weights area\nor working your \u2018abs of steel\u2019 on what\nlooks suspiciously like an old space\nhopper, get the post workout meal\nright and you\u2019re onto a winner.\nBefore we get into the nuts and\nbolts of the meal, let\u2019s talk about sup-plements. The use of supplements is\ncontained in the word \u2013 it should be\nsupplementing what you\u2019re getting\nfrom your food, not replacing it. So before you go spending your hard earned\nstudent loans on the latest \u201cevolutionary ionised whey protein with cell volumisation\u201d have a look at what all your\nmeals of the day consist of. In most\ncases once you create the right balance\nwith all your meals, you won\u2019t have the\nneed for supplements. Remember you\ncan always ask the Energia gym team if\nyou are unsure.\nThe ratio and amount of macronu-trients (carbohydrates, protein and\nfat) in the after workout meal will differ according to what you have done\nin that session, your lean body weight\nand other variables but a good guide is\nto have a 2: 1 ratio of carbohydrates to\nprotein.\nWhat it all means\nI\u2019m a big advocate of making your\nown post workout meal, whether that\nbe bringing it with you to eat after the\ngym or going back to your digs and\nrustling it up there and then. In addition to the meal being full of the right\nthings it also needs to be consumed\nwithin an hour of your workout finishing - your body is in need of that food\nto start the recovery process so don\u2019t\nhang about! A good tip is when you\nprepare your evening meal to make\ndouble the amount of the meal you will\nbe eating so you can eat one lot then\nand save the other for after your workout the next day, but remember not\ntwo lots of curry and chips please!\nDon\u2019t stick to the same thing all the\ntime!

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 2 November 2007 felix\nNews\nOver the past few weeks, complaints\nhave been received from several sources about the behaviour of Imperial students around campus. The criticisms\nall share one common feature: accusations of students\u2019 lack of discipline and\nrespect for their college.\nThe front page of Felix this week\nshows a letter received from an offended visitor who was appalled at the lack\nof consideration that students in the\nJCR showed for their surroundings as\nthey left the place covered in litter and\nuneaten food. He went on to question\nthe prevailing attitude amongst the of-fenders, and to maintain that \u201ctidiness\nin (the) scientific world is essential.\u201d\nWhilst the letter is phrased as a gentle reprimand of the student body, it\nfollows similar complaints received by\nFelix over the past few weeks, seeming\nto follow a trend of people becoming\ndistressed at the lack of care that students show for their environment and\ncolleagues. One can only speculate\nwhat the 78 year old author would have\nthought had he learned of the events\nsurrounding the Royal School of Mines\n(RSM) Freshers\u2019 Dinner.\nFelix has learned, from sources at the\nevent two weeks ago, that the hosts of\nthe \u201cmost notorious night of the year\u201d\nhave been temporarily banned from\nholding a \u2018sit-down\u2019 dinner whilst its\nfuture is debated. Sources close to the\nevent have alleged that the dinner involved abuse of the traditional \u201cfining\u201d\nsystem (where freshers are commanded to drink large quantities of alcohol\nfor committing offences such as sitting\ndown before the president, and removing a jacket at the wrong time) which\napparently continued for over an hour,\nbreakage of a large quantity of glass-ware, a food fight at dessert, copious\namounts of vomit, and an unknown\nperson urinating into a pint glass and\nleaving it to be found by the staff. The\ndinner was finished early after staff or-Students: selfish and inconsiderate?\nCharacter of Imperial students debated after multiple complaints over their questionable behaviour\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\ndered them to leave when the dessert\nwas found to be decorated over the\nwalls.\nWhilst the RSM has been charged\nfor damages and forced to apologise,\nits already poor reputation has not\nbeen improved and serious questions\nare being asked about the event, which\nseems to become more extreme in its\nabuses each year.\n\u201cOur dinner runs in a similar fashion,\nwith traditional fines and freely accessible wine,\u201d said one CGCU member\nfollowing their union dinner, \u201dbut the\nRSM take it far too far. They\u2019re just\nanimals.\u201d Indeed, comparison to the\npopular CGCU Freshers\u2019 dinner portrays the RSM in an even more negative light, after it passed \u201cpleasantly all\nround,\u201d and without major incident.\nMost worrying is the RSM\u2019s reaction\nto the incidents. Whilst they have officially apologised to College catering,\nan article that was submitted to Felix\nfollowing the event (see \u201cJust Another\nNight in the RSM\u201d) shows their point\nof view on the subject, \u201cpools of regurgitated joy\u201d and all.\nFor decades now, debate has been rife\nacross society surrounding the \u201cyouth\nof today\u201d and their seeming decline in\n\u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cdiscipline.\u201d Perhaps this is\njust another case of society\u2019s changing\nformats. But when \u201cthe youth\u201d begin\nto shock not just the previous genera-tions, but their own contemporaries,\nsomething must be very wrong with\nthe population.\nJust another night in the RSM\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most notorious night of the year!\u201d was the first thing Union President\nStephen Brown had to say when asked to comment on what he thought of the\nRSM Freshers Dinner. From what I remember, this year was no exception.\nThe fun begins when all the newbies learn that the ticket they\u2019ve just purchased entitles them to a host for the evening. Such hosts take the form of\nany previous survivors from last years carnage and it\u2019s their job to provide\nthe freshers with drinks for the evening. Sometimes these drinks are of the\nalcoholic variety and sometimes these drinks are of the very alcoholic variety.\nNevertheless, it is not in the interest of the freshers to spend a single penny\nmore than what they paid for the ticket. Now, freshers being freshers then\nbecome stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place when the pre-dinner drinks begin. Let\u2019s face it, we\u2019ve all been there. It\u2019s hard to refuse a\ndrink when it\u2019s bought for you.\nAfter a quiet pint or 6 at the bar, the mining student body both first years\nand veterans alike staggered down to the MDH for the dinner. Not even had\nthe first course been completed when our beloved RSM president, Mr Danny\nHill, stood up and in very good taste, fined all those filthy little retards who\nbegan to eat before he had. For those reading who ask why? Well, its tradition\nto follow one particular Royal\u2019s set of regulations at our dinners.\nPlenty more fines were issued for various acts of misconduct and dress code\ninfringements and as the beer, wine or spirits slipped down our throats the\nmemories began to get hazy. I do however remember one particular young\nblooded lad to my left who said something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s not that\nhard to down wine\u201d\u2026\u202616 rather swiftly imbibed glasses latter I was met by\nthe most unholy retch I\u2019ve ever heard and a wet sleeve. My next little flash of\nmemory was being in a toilet cubicle nursing the poor guy back to a state of\npseudo-life.\nI returned to the dinning hall just in time for dessert, which I might say was\na damn sight better than the slice of pensioner\u2019s handbag they tried to pass\nof as pork. A glass of water or two down my own neck made me see and appreciate in true detail just how good a time people had been having. Pools of\nregurgitated joy lay all around as did several of our new followers. The thing\nis though; if they could only just learn to keep their mouths shut then they\u2019d\nnever get themselves into these situations. Any person stupid enough to approach a certain individual with a habit of wearing a tie every Friday and say\n\u201cI love vodka\u201d is going to be rewarded with just that. Ouch.\nHowever, a few more drinks made me stop caring and enjoy the music that\nhad begun to play. That\u2019s DJ music, not music in my head. The next thing\neveryone (and I do mean everyone) seems to remember is suddenly being in\nthe union again. Apparently we had been asked nicely to leave so the stewards\ncould clear up our \u2018happy puddles\u2019 and had brought the party elsewhere. All\nin all it was a cracking night despite the rotten food. A tactical stop at Subway\nprevented any manner of beastly hangover which would no doubt have otherwise reared its ugly head the following morning. Special thanks to all those\nwho had a pint glass holding hand in the setting up of the room as well as a\nbig pat on the back to our Honorary Secretary, Mr Alex Middleton, for organising said event. Cheers lads and lasses, can\u2019t wait to do it all over again!\nby Steve Smith (RSM member)\n\u201cPoor Fresher!\u201d (caption and photograph supplied by RSM)\nStudent held at gunpoint 20 minutes from IC\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nAt around 2:30pm on Wednesday af-ternoon, a student from Imperial College was mugged by two men, one of\nwhich was armed.\nThe student, a member of Photosoc,\nwho wishes to remain anonymous, was\nmaking his way to university from his\nhouse in the early hours of the after-noon. He reached the large Tesco supermarket on Cromwell Road where\nhe was asked if he had any \u201cweed\u201d by\ntwo black men. After declining to give\nthe men anything, one of the muggers\nrevealed a large pistol. He pulled the\ngun from beneath his trousers and demanded the student to hand over his\nmobile phone.\nThe student who is a keen photographer had his expensive SLR in hand\nat the time as he had just been taking\nsome pictures. \u201cWithout thinking,\u201d the\nphotographer commented to Felix,\n\u201cI handed over my mobile phone and\npushed my camera in their direction\nat the same time too. They didn\u2019t even\nthreaten me for the camera, I just gave\nit to them.\u201d\nThe student suffered no physical assault as the muggers then walked away\nwith over \u00a3300 worth of electronic\nequipment.\nThe incident occurred less than\ntwenty minutes away from campus.\nThe student carried on towards university and happened to see a parked\npolice car, so he informed the officers\nof the crime.\nThe photographer described the\nmuggers to Felix as \u201cpeople you\u2019d expect to get mugged by\u201d but despite this\nhe was still surprised at the \u201cdaylight\nrobbery.\u201d He continued by commenting\non how unexpected the whole event\nwas and how he thought \u201cit might have\nhappened around North End Road at\n2:30am (nearer to his house), but not\nthere at 2:30 in the afternoon.\u201d\nThe student stated that he \u201cwill be\nfar more cautious in the future, when\nwalking around with expensive stuff\u201d\nand that he felt a mixture of emotions:\nanger combined with relief that more\nwasn\u2019t stolen from him, or that he\nhadn\u2019t been hurt.\nHe offered some advice to anyone\nelse who finds themselves in such horrific circumstances: \u201cIf it happens to\nyou, just hand over your stuff, it\u2019s really not worth it. Make sure you report\nthe incident to the police too.\u201d The police contacted the victim at his home\nlater in the evening and informed him\nthat a man had been arrested later on\nWednesday, possibly in connection\nwith the mugging.\nThankfully the Photosoc member\nwas not attacked or assaulted. Felix\nspoke to him a few hours after the incident when he appeared at the office\ndoor requesting to use the telephone.\nHe appeared remarkably calm to this\nreporter considering what had happened only moments earlier.\nIf you have been the victim of crime,\nthere are support services available\nwithin both the Union and College.\nFor general advice, ranging from getting help with insurance companies\nto dealing with the distress of being a\nvictim of crime, you can contact Nigel\nCooke in the Information and Advice\ncentre by phoning 020 7594 8067 (ext:\n48067). Alternatively you can talk to\nthe Student Counselling Service by\nphoning 020 7594 9637 (ext: 49637).\nBoth services are free and offer full\nconfidentiality.

    "content": "Emile Hirsh charms as the wild one but old Americana overshadows him\nThe Wild Ways of Mr Sean Penn\nSeanPennisoftenadmiredasthegreatest actor of his generation, endowed\nwith a knack of longevity despite playing characters that are not particularly\nwell-liked. This isn\u2019t the same as the\nlikes of Christopher Lee where recurring villainous roles fill a filmography\nout nicely, but rather that of espousing\nan acting ability so strong that an audience can get past his characters\u2019 flaws,\neven be they rape and murder. This is\nnot to say that audience likeability appears to bother Penn, and in fact, as\nan actor, he appears bothered that the\naudience is even part of his work. As\nhe returns to directing however, the\nburden of the audience and the conveyance of a story would seem to rest\nmuch more on his shoulders, so what\nreally is Sean Penn\u2019s problem?\nPenn doesn\u2019t appear to be a media\nfan. He spends the entire conference\nwe have sat cross-legged, with arms\nfolded and speaks quickly and quietly,\nalmost mumbling at points sending a\nworry around the room that nobody\u2019s\nmicrophone would even pick it up.\nThe only time he seems to have a real\ninterest in the event is when he listens\nto star of his new film, Emile Hirsch,\nwho is sat next to him, fit in a few\nwords, breaking a smile like a proud\nfather. This isn\u2019t too big a surprise given the typical banality of these things\ncompared with being on the set of his\nlatest film, Into The Wild, carving out\na gorgeous slice of old Americana, but\nyou think he\u2019d give us something to\nwork with.\nThe impression that is given is one of\nlove for his work, rather than the publi-cising of it, a standard for anyone with\nthe credibility he has attained. His distaste for the media since his marriage\nto Madonna in the eighties seems to\nhave stuck with him while she has simply turned to playing them like an eight\nyear old girl manages Barbie dolls. But\nwith a body of work like Penn\u2019s,\nit is easy to understand why\nit is of more interest than\nhow he\u2019s living his personal life.\nAfter a string of\nroles from the\nearly eighties,\nhe solidified\nhis talent in\nthe early\nnineties\nwith Brian\nDe Palma\u2019s\nCarlito\u2019s\nWay and\nthen got\nthe Academy talking with\nTim Robbins\u2019 Dead\nMan Walking by 1995.\nThe latter\nperformance\nsaw him receive\nhis first nod for\nplaying a man on\ndeath row fighting for life with the\nhelp of a nun, Susan\nSarandon, who walked\naway with her own statu-ette. From there, Penn moved\ninto a different stream and in\nthe early part of this century\nseemed to develop an interest in documentaries but\nstill turned in outstanding performances in the\nlikes of I Am Sam, 21\nGrams and Mystic\nRiver, the latter\nof which se-Oscar winning actor and former Mr Madonna talks to Felix about acting, LA love and passion for directing.\nAlex Casey\nBeing selected as the Kyoto Planet\nGala in this years festival is definitely\nnot beyond the scope of reason where\nthis film is concerned as its celebration\nof nature is unmatched amongst the\nother selections this year. In fact, the\ntrue story of Chris McCandless and his\nvoyage into the wilderness of the United States has such breathtaking images\nof nature that it\u2019s hard to believe a large\npart of it wasn\u2019t funded by the Alaskan\ntourist board. Fifteen years after the\nstory first unfolded, Sean Penn gives it\nthe big screen treatment it\u2019s been waiting for, with a backdrop that you just\ndon\u2019t find in a studio.\nChris McCandless was a university\ngraduate back in the early nineties who\ntook off to explore his country away\nfrom society, donating all his money to\ncharity and leaving his family no way\nto contact him. His transformation\ninto his alias Alexander Supertramp\nsaw him travel between Mexico and\nAlaska, living on the road and meeting various characters along the way.\nWith the voyage transferred to a cinema screen, its hard to imagine why\nAmerica established its greatest cities\nin places such that nobody would ever\nsee these wonders. Thankfully Penn\nwas on hand to show them what they\nwere missing.\nEmile Hirsch throws himself into the\ncentral performance with the conviction and look very reminiscent of an\nearly Penn. Without such a performance the film would not work, and\nHirsch proves a treat to watch on his\nadventure. The supporting cast of\ncharacters that Chris/Alex meets along\nthe way is full of comfortable perform-ances, including the Vince Vaughn and\nthe ever malleable Catherine Keener,\nhere a hippie on the road with her\nboyfriend in some very touching mo-ments. It is without doubt the moments of interaction with these people\nthat surpass the films potential as an\nadvert for America and make the story\nthe real biographical journey of human\ninterest that it is.\nMarciaGayHardenandWilliamHurt\nprovide suitable motive for wishing to\nescape your previous life as the unfor-Alex Casey\nInto The Wild \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Sean Penn\nWriter: Sean Penn\nCast: Emile Hirsch,\nCatherine Keener,\nVince Vaughn\ntunate parents whilst Jena Malone\u2019s\ninfrequent voice-over as the sister experiencing various feelings about her\nbrothers disappearance reminds the\naudience that this is a human story\nrather than just an adventure yarn.\nSean Penn, being a particularly outspoken detractor of the war in Iraq and\nAmerican foreign policy in the post-9/11 age, expresses with conviction the\ndesire to escape a society controlled by\nmaterial possessions and hollow pre-occupations. His direction seems more\nfluid than previous outings and raises\nhis skills towards those of his acting\nabilities, but with so much passion for\nthis particular piece it will be interesting to see if this can be carried over to\nother projects in the future.\nThe primary criticism of Into The\nWild would have to be that it feels\nslightly overlong. The episodic nature\nof the journey is broken up by cutting\nbetween pieces in Alaska and the rest\nof the quest, and then the scenes of the\nfamily left behind but as it moves from\none set of characters to the next, it begins to get weighed down under the\nburden of time. Whilst each person\nhas something to add you can\u2019t help\nbut wish they did so that bit faster.\nThis doesn\u2019t stop it being a largely\nenjoyable film however, and the cinematography will no doubt sweep\nthe boards come award time. If Penn\nmakes it as well, then he could join the\nhallowed halls of the select few who\ncan call themselves \u2018actor/director\u2019\nwith any degree of credibility.\nActually, it doesn\u2019t take an award\nto recognise the talent that this film\nshows.\nYes, \u201cwild\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to cover it...\ncured him the Oscar. It is\nSam however which offers possibly the best\nlook at his range as\nan actor though,\nespecially compared with River\nand Dead Man\nWalking, as his\nportrayal of an\nautistic father\ndesperately trying to keep custody of his child\n(a young Dakota\nFanning, before\nshe became the token child in every\nfilm that required\nit) displays an innocence and character\nskills far removed\nfrom the violent personae of the other\ntwo.\nInto The Wild\ndoesn\u2019t star Sean Penn\nhowever, it\u2019s directed\nby him. The attempt\nat direction by stars\ncan be a mixed bag\nthough; for every Clint\nEastwood success story\n(well, if success is judged\non awards over integrity),\nthere\u2019s another handful who\njust thought that it looked\ntoo easy and were just hushed-up. Previous directorial efforts\nfrom Penn himself have received\nmixed response since his debut in the chair back in The\nIndian Runner (1991)\nand little known\nsubsequent works, The Crossing Guard and\nThe Pledge. With Into The Wild, Penn\nhas certainly improved his talent as a\nstoryteller along with his visual eye,\nbut will it be sufficient to break free of\nthe actor tag?\nHere\u2019s hoping so, for his sake, as\nPenn has a slightly surprising view\nof acting: \u201cMost of why I acted in the\nlast ten years was to steal film school\ntime from these guys. Those were the\nchoices I was making, looking at directors that I could learn from.\u201d Whatever\nthat says about the wider view actors\nhold of their profession, it\u2019s surprising\nto hear such an opinion from someone\nnear the top of the pile in terms of acting talent using it as a stepping stone.\nOn direction he states: \u201cIf what you\u2019re\nlooking for is love and you\u2019re looking\nfor it every night in bars in Los Angeles, you\u2019re lucky if once every five years\nyou find what it is and then you\u2019ll have\naffairs. In moviemaking, an affair with\na piece of material is not going to cut\nit cause you gotta stay in love for years\nto get through it. I think I know more\nwhat I\u2019m looking for in that love than\nbefore.\u201d\nIt shouldn\u2019t really come as such a\nsurprise that Penn wants more than\nsomeone else\u2019s words to work with.\nHe\u2019s had a very strong voice of his\nown in terms of politics, appearing\nquite publicly to denounce the Bush\nadministration and their war in Iraq,\nso transposing that eloquence of opinion to a storytelling perspective would\nseem appealing. He certainly seems to\ndisplay a real enthusiasm for accuracy\nin the detail he refers to in recreating\nthe true story of Chris McCandless in\nthis latest picture. Penn has had access\nto the greatest directing talent in Hollywood and beyond as he says, and it\ncertainly seems he has plenty drive to\nfocus his attentions on direction rather\nthan acting. Could he be the next Clint\nEastwood? Not if he wants to remain a\nrogue maverick.\n28 felix Friday 2 November 2007\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\n\n"

No, she\u2019s not getting a make-over \u2013 they\u2019re collecting stable isotope deposits\nCSI: Cuzco \u2013 Incan ritual sacrifices\nAn international team of researchers has found that the ritual sacrifice\nof Inca children involved \u201cfattening\u201d\nthem up before death. Using data from\nstable isotopes and DNA they have\nbeen able to establish a picture of the\nfinal few months of four mummified\nchildren found at some of the highest\narchaeological sites in the world.\nTo discover information about these\nfinal months the scientists measured\ndeposits of various stable isotopes in\nhair samples from the children. Scalp\nhair samples were used for analysis as\nthis tye of hair grows approximately\n1 cm a month, the isotope deposits it\ncontains reflecting the food that an individual has eaten during the months\nleading up to their death. Once de-posited, these stable isotopes (which\ninclude carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and\nhydrogen \u2013 see box for details) remain\nunchanged for thousands of years.\nTwo of the children were recovered\nfrom a shrine 25m from the 6,739m\nsummit of Volc\u00e1n Llullaillaco, the highest archaeological site in the world.\nThey were a 15 year old girl called the\n\u201cLlullaillaco Maiden\u201d and a 7 year old\nboy called, you\u2019ve guessed it, \u201cLlullaillaco Boy\u201d.\nThe shrine is one of over 100 Inca\nritual sites all located between 5,200m\nand 6,700m. The peaks of the Andes\nwere sacred to the Inca, and were often associated or even identified with\nthe major deities such as the weather\ngod Illapa. Sacrifices at these peaks reinforced the reverence for these sacred\npeaks and legitimized the growing Inca\nempire.\nDr Andrew Wilson, of the University\nof Bradford, and the lead author on this\nresearch commented: \u201cBy examining\nhair samples from these unfortunate\nchildren, a chilling story has started to\nemerge of how the children were \u2018fattened up\u2019 for sacrifice\u201d.\nHistorical and archaeological accounts suggest that those chosen for\nsacrifice would first be taken to Cuzco,\nthe capital of the Inca Empire, where\ncelebrations would take place for their\nimpending sacrifice. Following the celebrations the children would begin a\npilgrimage to one of the burial sites in\nthe Andes, which could last for several\nmonths.\nStable isotope analysis of hair samples from the Maiden show a changing diet during the 12 months before\nher death, suggesting an elevation in\nher status as she was prepared for sac-rifice. Originally she had been fed a\ndiet of vegetables, such as potato, suggesting that she came from a peasant\nbackground.\nHer diet then changed to one containing plants such as maize and protein from charqui (dried llama meat),\nboth regarded as \u201celite\u201d foods in Inca\nsocieties, and which would have been\ndeposited for the children at way stations along their pilgrimage route.\nWhile the cause of death of these\nchildren is still unclear, it is known that\nthey were given maize beer to \u201cdull\ntheir senses\u201d and coca leaves (a chewing quid was found in the mouth of the\nMaiden) to alleviate altitude sickness\nand inure them to their situation, hastening their deaths.\nPrevious research has shown that\nLlullaillaco Boy was particularly distressed when he died.

Yet through the\nBradford scientists\u2019 work, they may yet\nprove to be some of its most important\nemissaries to the present, providing\nus with an insight into rituals which\nhave previously remained shrouded in\nmystery.\nGossip. Loose talk which costs lives, or indirect reciprocity\u2019s lynchpin?\nPssst, have you heard? Some clever\nclogs over at the Max Planck institute\nhave found that far from insidiously\nundermining the social fabric of com-munity, gossip could actually form an\nextremely important part of the way\nwe interact with our peers \u2013 and even\nbe key to the evolution of our society.\nResearchers have been aware for a\nwhile that humans help each other out\nthrough \u2018indirect reciprocity\u2019. This is\nthe idea that it\u2019s good for me to help\npeople out, as the likelihood is that you\nwill then give me a hand when I need\nit. But the chances are that, even if you\nand I are acquainted, you\u2019ll have very\nlittle idea whether I habitually help old\ngrannies cross the road or prefer stealing their hairnets. So how does indirect\nreciprocity actually function?\nObviously, only a small fraction of a\ngiven population would have the opportunity to directly observe an interaction between two of its members.\nRalf Sommerfeld and his team investigated to what extent gossip might help\nprovide the mechanism for the infor-mation-sharing that is needed. Do we\nactually pay any attention to idle chatter when forming opinions about our\npeers, or do we give everyone a chance\nto make their own impressions? And\nwhich is the more savvy thing to do?\nSommerfeld\u2019s team got their results\nthrough the age-old method of giving\nmoney to a herd of undergraduates in\nexchange for them becoming guinea\npigs in an experiment involving \u2018prisoner\u2019s dilemma\u2019 style computer games.\nParticipants could cooperate \u2013 each\nparticipant giving up \u00a31.25 of their\nmoney to obtain \u00a32.00 for their partner\n\u2013 or be mean, and take everyone else\u2019s\nmoney but not give away any of their\nown. Although the best way to maximise everyone\u2019s wealth would be for\neveryone to be generous and give away\nmoney, the best way for an individual\nto do the same is to be mean.\nAlthough not perfect, the game is a\nuseful analogy for human society in\ngeneral, and in particular the \u2018tragedy\nof the commons\u2019, as it may provide\nclues as to what stops public resources\nbeing completely exploited. It\u2019s been\nspeculated that the answer is reputa-tion; people who are consistently mean\n\u2013 I like to call them bastards \u2013 get\nsticking the knife in, maybe you can\ntake comfort in the fact that you could\nbe performing a valuable function for\nhumanity, you backstabbing cow.\nfound out, and the indirect reciprocity\nsystem shuns them.\nSommerfeld found that when they\ngave players in the game the chance\nto rate their partners and share that\ninformation with the community, then\nmean players suffered and generous\nplayers gained. As predicted, players\nwere making decisions on whether to\ncooperate or not based on gossip. Even\nmore interestingly, the information\nthey gained via gossip was more influential and could even overrule what\nthey saw through direct observation.\nThis research suggests that, far from\nbeing damaging, gossip is actually a\nreliable and very powerful source of\nsocial information, which provides\ncommunity cohesion by discouraging\n\u2018free riders\u2019.

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\nBuscemi on getting it wrong\nS\nince the late eighties, Steve\nBuscemi has been one of\nthe most instantly recognisable faces of the American indie scene. His roles\nin such films as Reservoir Dogs and\nGhost World along with his many collaborations with the Coen Brothers\nin classics such as Fargo and The Big\nLebowski have cornered him a niche in\nthe market playing oddball characters.\nNow stepping up to the mic at the\nNFT to deliver one of the festival\u2019s\neagerly awaited screentalks, Film\nFelix asks whether or not he can\ncaptivate without his characters.\nBuscemi has made it surprisingly big in cinema considering that\nhe is known best for supporting\nroles. He intersperses appearances in independent productions with a couple of big money deals in the likes of Con Air\nand Armageddon to \u201censure\nthe smaller films get paid for\u201d\nas he puts it, and you\u2019d be hard\npushed to ever call him a sell\nout.\nWith Interview included in\nthe official London festival\nselection though, it is his role\nas director and lead actor that\nbring him to our glorious city,\nand whilst not his first stab\nat directing, the attention the\nfilm has already garnered would\nseem to suggest that this is something he may want to consider\nagain in the future. Yet, depite\nbeing selected for a screentalk,\nBuscemi doesn\u2019t seem to have that\nmuch to say for himself.\nHis anecdootes tend to fall way\nshort of the strangeness you expect from his character. For\nexample, when asked about\nhis collaborations with\nthe Coens he\nlays\nTaking over NFT1, Steve Buscemi headlines the TCM screentalk with a unique style\nthe foundations for a great story only\nfor the punchline to be \u201cI read the\nscript fastest and so I got the job\u201d in a\nnutshell.\nHe seems to show a certain amount\nof impatience throughout as well. The\ntalk was not given in the form of a lecture but an onstage\nDelicious digging up of much more than just dirt in interview with a vamp\nThe genesis of Interview has an appeal\nmore intriguing than its own concept.\nThe film itself is a remake, the original\nbeing the work of Theo Van Gogh, a\nDutch director little known outside of\nhis own country until his murder at the\nhands of an Islamic extremist, unhappy\nwith the portrayal of religion in one of\nhis films, attracted the attention of the\nfilm world.\nIn conflict with many European film-makers, Van Gogh did not shun the\nHollywood machine and dreamed of\nmaking films there, a dream that his associates did not want to break just because of his passing. Instead of letting\nhis legacy lie in the Netherlands, they\ntook three of his films to Hollywood\nfor him and set about having them remade with Hollywood stars, the first of\nwhich was to become Interview.\nThe premise of the film is simple\nand much less Hollywood. Steve Buscemi switches sides of the camera to\nboth direct and star here, helming the\nrole of the interviewer, Pierre, a politics journalist sent by his office to interview soap starlet and tabloid bait\nKatya, the ever-so-appropriate Sienna\nMiller. Katya, as is described early on,\nis not exactly the Hilary Clinton-style\ncatch Pierre wishes he could sideline,\nbut rather a fluctuating bust with a\nvery public love life. Is Miller really so\nunaware that she didn\u2019t see her name\nall over this?\nInterview strives beyond simple stunt\ncasting though to question its subjects,\nand thrives on the assumptions of the\naudience. Sienna seizes the screen with\na sexy, strong performance that leaves\nyou astonished. An audience unaware\nof her talent react with shocked awe,\nparallel to that which Pierre experiences at the hands of Katya\u2019s surprisingly eclectic attitude. An intellectual\nt\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between the pair twists and\nAlex Casey\nInterview \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nDirector: Steve Buscemi\nWriter: Steve Buscemi,\nTheodor Holman\nCast: Steve Buscemi,\nSienna Miller\nturns to form the basis of the story,\npoking delightful fun at the media\nperception we have of modern starlets\nand also the underlying similarities\nthat people from completely different\nwalks of life hold.\nIf the concept sounds tedious, rest\nassured that it is not. The central performances are both fantastic with Buscemi managing to direct himself beyond the scope his normal supporting\nroles allow him, and Miller simply glittering with a stunning range. The two\nleads explore themselves much more\nthan any real interview would allow,\nand the script dazzles with humour,\nemotion and wit. The primary setting\nof Katya\u2019s loft apartment allows the\ncamera crew to waltz casually around\nthe action that plays out like dialogue\ndriven theatre.\nInterview is a film that within the\nfirst half hour wipes clean your preconceptions and admiration floods in\nto fill the vacuum instantly. At the incredibly short running time of 82 minutes it doesn\u2019t have much time to work\nits magic, but it manages with reels of\nfilm to spare. The Van Gogh original\nmay still remain obscure with such a\nfantastic remake looming over it, but it\nhas done something to bring his name\nand work to a larger audience. It is perhaps the rehabilitation of Sienna Miller\u2019s image that stands to be the greatest\nachievement of this film however, and\nall this in spite of the films clear message that there is always much more\nthan what you see on screen\u2026\nIt takes two to tango\ninterview, resembling a press confer-encewith a live studio audience, especially when they open up the floor to\nquestions. In this environment, his impatience is easily understood however.\nWhen invited to talk about your\nwork, anyone with a sense of integrity\nmight expect to discuss the artistic\nmerits on which they are judged,\nnot \u201cHow do you feel about\nbeing voted sexiest man alive\nby US magazine?\u201d or \u201cHow\nwould I deliver my script\ninto the hands of someone of such stature as\nyourself?\u201d. Brown\nnosing and selfishness rarely make\nfor a crowd pleas-er. In this sense\nit is hard to get a\ntrue view of an\nactor trying to\nexpress a more\npersonal voice\nas a director.\nOn topics of\nsuitability how-ever, Buscemi\nis a man full of\npraise for anyone he deems\nworthy of it. He\nisn\u2019t shy about\ntelling of the talent\nof the Coen brothers as writers and directors but at the same time he\navoids gushing uncontrol-lably. When asked about his\ninfluences in moviemaking\nstyle, he is similarly quick to\npoint to the influence of the\ngrandfather of American\nindie cinema, John Cassavettes and the\nnew\nstyle that he brought to film at the\ntime.\n\u201cThe thing I like about Cassavettes\nis that I saw a retrospective of his\nworks after he\u2019d died and what struck\nme about them was that it was okay to\nget it wrong. As a writer I was always\ntold you have to have your beginning,\nmiddle and end before you start writing and that was something that had\nalways got me: I would have a beginning but I could never define where the\nmiddle would bulk out. What I saw\nfrom Cassavettes is that you don\u2019t have\nto always know where you\u2019re going and\nin so many of his films you don\u2019t know\nwhere you\u2019re going to go next so it\u2019s alright to be uncertain of that and for me\nthat was just such a blessed relief that I\nreally admired him.\u201d\nThis is a feature not glaringly obvious\nin Interview, although the constantly\nmeandering dynamics of the principal\ncharacters\u2019 relationship does invest a\ncertain amount of fun into his narrative stylings. However, even when\nasked about his message in Interview,\nabout the media and its portrayal of\ncelebrity these days, he dismisses it as\nunimportant to the film. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nInterview is essentially about celebrity\nand the culture surrounding it. The\nway I see it is as a film about two people from completely different worlds\nwho find that beneath the surface they\nhave a lot more in common than is obvious\u201d. So, no scathing comment there\nthen, at least not consciously. He\u2019s also\nquick to shoot down the other standard suggestion of credible subject mat-ter: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t feel I need a turn\nto politics to justify myself\u201d.\nPerhaps this is what may lead to Buscemi\u2019s failure as a director over time.\nTo retain credibility, you have to have\nsomething to say. Judging from this\nparticular interview, that looks like it\nmight be a problem.\nLet\u2019s just hope that he finds a clearer\nvoice amongst some better questions\nsoon.\n26 felix Friday 2 November 2007\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nT\nhis week sees the end of\nanother year at the London Film Festival, so as\ncinephiles readjust to natural sunlight, we at Felix\nhave chosen a small selection of what\nwe thought was worth catching.\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy choice deciding what to bring you, but we made a\nfew educated guesses at what you\u2019d like\nto follow and hopefully there\u2019s enough\nto cover something for everyone. Assumptions in place, this week\u2019s bumper\nfilm section includes profiles on two of\nAmerica\u2019s most interesting filmmak-ers, Steve Buscemi and Sean Penn,\nboth making the dangerous leap from\nacting in front of the camera to getting into the director\u2019s chair. These are\neven supplemented by reviews of their\ntwo great additions to the festival, both\nof which are on general release this\nmonth.\nDon\u2019t think that sounds up to much?\nWell don\u2019t be so hasty, because the Felix Film team have managed to acquire\n200 free tickets to a preview screening\nof Into The Wild with details following over the next few pages. As if that\nwasn\u2019t a good enough offer, we also got\nin touch with Rough Guides to bring\nyou ANOTHER competition giving\nyou the chance to win a copy of the\nnew Rough Guide to Film. Just don\u2019t\nsay that we never give you anything.\nFinally, we\u2019ve had word of a screening of the award-winning oil documentary A Crude Awakening in the Renoir\nCinema in Brunswick Square at 1pm\non Sunday 4th Nov with discounted\naccess for Imperial students and staff\nso be sure to check it out.\nMaybe we\u2019ve spoiled you just a tad\ntoo much.\n\n"
