    "content": "Page 2 FELIX November 20th,1973 LETTERS Pitiful\nSir,\nHave pity on the poor\nChurch Commissioners,\nwhat can they do to be\nright? If they don't improve their property they\nare accused of being\nslum landlords; if they\naccused of being ruthless developers; if they\nsold it all and invested\nthe proceeds they would\nbe called filthy capital-is ts; and l if they gave all\nthe money away there\nwould be a triumphant\ncrowing that this proved\nthe Church couldn't cope\nwith the realities of modern life.\nFortunately the Church Commissioners are determined to pursue their\ntheir policy of providing\ndecent accommodation for all sections of the community, and are not\ngoing to be deflected by\nthe kind of attack you published a week ago.\nIt is worth investigating the case of 3 8 and40 Formosa Street in\nsome detail, because it\nshows the difficulties\nthat mindless militancy\nputs in the way of people\nwho are trying to operate a responsible housing policy in the area.\nFirst, the original tenants have all been rehoused by the Church Commissioners or offered comparable alternative accommodation. The present occupants\nof the houses are squatters Who moved in In\nSeptember and are preventing the conversion\nof three large old houses into ten flats for families living in sub-stand-ard accommodation in\nthe area. A typical rent\nfor a2 bedroomed self-contained flat after the\nconversion would be \u00a39\nper week \u2014 hardly extortionate by London stand-ard s. If even this rent is\ntoo high for some lower\nincome families they can of course obtain a substantial rent rebate from\nthe local council. The Church Commissioners have met representatives of the Form osa Street squatters to\nexplain the situation to\nthem, and have made an approach on their behalf\nto the Westminster City\nCouncil to try and help\nthem find their own housing. What the Commissioners cannot accept\nis that, young, single,\nactive people should just\nmove in and take over\naccommodation earmarked for local families in\nneed of decent homes. The situation at 3 5 B Shir land Road is even\nmore disturbing. Here\nthe Commissioners had renovated a flat for an80 year old pensioner\n(rent \u00a36 per week, less\nrent rebate). A week be fore she was due to\nmove in the flat was broken into and taken\nover by two or three\nyoung men from over-seas. Iam not at all nationalistic\u2014'but Ido not see by what right\nyoung men from Holland and America come here\nand appropriate for\nthemselves an old lady's flat-\u2014and then ask our sympathy for doing so. The Church Commissioners control about\n6,000 flats, houses, and other rented accommodation in London. Persuing their policy of providing housing for all sections of the community three quarters of this\naccommodation is let for\nrents of less than \u00a310\nper week, half of it for\nless than \u00a35 per week.\nIn recent years the\nChurch has housed dozens of I.C. students in Six short 'life houses\nWhich were made available completely free of\ncharge.\nIf the anti-God squad\nwere not so blinded by\nideological spleen they\nmight see that the best\nway to help the homeless would be to stop\nhindering the renovation\nof ageing property in Inner London.\nMy suspicion, on the\nevidence before me, is\nthat they are not so interested in i the plight of\nthe homeless as they are\nin delivering deceitful\nand malicious attacks on those who are grappling\nwith the problem, while\ngrabbing free accommodation for themselves.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Ashforth,\nChaplain.\nEd's note: the article\nwas reprinted from an\nissue of E.A.S.Y., a weekly squatters paper\nand as such did not reflect my views but the\nviews of those people in\nthe college associated\nwith E.A.S.Y. Any reply\non this question would\nbe welcomed.\nMaoist?\nSir,\nI wish first of all to\nmake it clear that Iam not connected with any political organisation in England and have heard\nabout Gerry Healy and about any matters regarding internal structure of SLL only through\nan organisation called\nCommunist Federation\nof, Britain. Iam not particularly well acquainted\nwith revolutionary politics in England, not having lived here very long,\ntherefore I do not wish to say What my own political position is as regards this country.\nHowever, being a supporter of a political\ngroup is not a prerequisite for criticising some\nof the nonsense I have\nread in your editorials,\nwhich is the basis on which I first wrote to\nFelix. It was not originally my intention to take\npart in a detailed theoretical discussion \u2014 Pel ix\nis not the place for this\n\u2014 only to point out the\nmost blatant contradictions in your statements.\nHowever to continue,\nsince we have got sO far:\nso you admit (at last)\nthat the labour party can-not/will not introduce\na socialist programme\nand you are supporting\nthe labour party only to\nprove this \u2014 \" to break\nthe working class from\nreformism\". Firstly, everyone knows, including\nthe labour party itself,\nthat the working class is\nnot voting labour now. You only need to look\nat the results of the last\nfour by-elections to see\nwhat the people of Britain think of the labour\nparty. Labour cannot\nWin even in a working class area like Glasgow.\nHowever, recognising\nthis, the bourgeoisie are\ntrying to promote the\nLiberal party. The point\nis that exposing the labour party does not automatically \" break the\nclass from reformism\". In fact, in the absence of\nrevolutionary politics, it\nleaves the working class\nin an ideological vacuum conclusive to the spread\nof fascist ideology as a\" solution\". However you recognise the need for a revolutionary party to lead\nthe working class. But to call yourselves the\nrevolutionary party is not\nenough; a party is only\nrevolutionary if it has a revolutionary political\nline. This the Workers' Revolutionary Party does\nnot have; as far as I can make out, your political\nline seems to consist on ly of electing a labour\ngovernment pledged to\nsocialist policies.\nContrary to raising the\npolitical level of the\nworking class, this actually lowers it since the\nworking class has al ready rejected labour.\nThe role of a revolutionary party must surely be\nto fill the ideological\nvacuum created by this\nrejection of the labour\nparty by spreading revolutionary ideology, i.e. the realization that it is\nnot just a question of\nfighting the Tories or\nlabour but of overthrowing the capitalist system\nitself, and to provide the\nleadership for this struggle. This I have never\nheard from YS S S,SL L,W.R. P. etc. \u2014 in fact you have been very reluctant\neven to admit that you do not believe the labour party can establish\nsocialism. Even if I do\nnot know which organisation here has the correct political line for\nBritain, I can tell it is\nmost certainly not the\nW. R.P. Yours sincerely,\nKathleen Corcoran\nS' Side Bar\nSir,\nWith reference to an\nunpleasant incident in\nSouth Side Bar on Thursday, 8 th November,\n1 9 7 3 . I would like to\nmake a protest against\nthe behaviour of certain\nI.C. Clubs during their\ninitiation of new members. This behaviour\ncould be prevented by greater supervision by\nl. C.U.,e. g.\" Duty Office rs\". This supervision\nshould be extended to\nvarious constituent College and Departmental\npub crawls, etc.\nThis has been brought\nto my attention by various regular student customers who object to\nsuch behaviour in certain\nCollege bars. I enclose\na copy of rules and regulations pertaining to\n'Duty Officer\" supervision. A cursory examination of the \" Duty Offic er\" book in Southside\nshows a dramatic fall-off\nin \" Duty Officers\" delegated since 1 9 7 0 . Com pare almost one per\nnight in1970 with only\ntwo in the whole of\n1 9 7 1 , complete absence\nin 1 9 7 2 and only three\nso far in 1 9 7 3 . I trust\nthat you will back me up\nin the encouragement of\nthese rules, as has been\ndone in the past, in the\nhope that previous standards can be maintained\nby your support in the\nre-establishment of the\npost of Duty Officer.\nThis is my first letter\nof protest since coming to this College, almost\nnine years ago, but I think that behaviour like\nthis should be checked before further incidents\nof this nature occur.\nYours faithfully,\nStan,\nSouthside Bar.\nR.C. C. TRANSPORT\nAs R.C. C. Transport\nbooking officer this year\nI have many people coming to book vehicles without much idea of what\nR.C. C. Transport is. To save me ten minutes Of\nexplanation each time I wiM try to briefly explain\nthe booking system.\nBookings:\nR.C. C. Transport is\nmainly for the use of a few\npriority clubs, since they\nuse i the vehicles more regularly than anybody else,\nand also supply people to\nrun them. These clubs\nhowever only have priority\nfor booking their particular vehicle, provided that\nthey book more than three\nweeks in advance. Other\nclubs are able to book in advance but confirmation\nwill not be given until less\nthan three weeks before\nthe required date. At the\nmoment we have a fifth\nvehicle which is not available to the priority clubs,\nunless it has not been\nbooked by anybody else\nthree days before they require it. Provisional booking forms are available\nfrom me in Selkirk 488, or\nfrom Pam the union re-ce pti on is t. The form must\nbe completed fully, and\nreturned to me via the\nunion letter rack.\nThe vehicles owned and\nrun by R.C. C. Transport\nat present are:\n17 Seater Crewbus: Priority, Mountaineering\nand Caving Clubs.\n12 Seater Minibus: Priority: Y. H.A. and Scout\nand Guide Clubs.\nU.W. Club Van: Priority: U.W. Surf and\nCanoe Clubs.\nI.C.C.A. G. Van: Priority: Community Action\nGroup.\nSpare Van: Priority:\nAny other club and private users.\nUse of R.C. C. vehicles:\nAll drivers must be approved by the Transport\nSub-Committee before being allowed to use any of\nthe vehicles. For confirmed bookings, the vehicle\nkeys will be left with the\nSouthside Messenger, in an envelope addressed to the\ndriver(s), half an hour before the time the vehicle\nis due to be used.\nThe driver must also\nproduce his/her registration card before being al lowed to take the keys\nfrom the messenger. Responsibility for the condition of the vehicle and accessories lies with the\ndriver, Who must fill in the\nrelevant parts of the log-sheet (one will be enclosed\nwith keys), before taking\nthe vehicle from the car\npark behind Linstead Hall, and fill in the rest of the\nlog sheet when returning\nthe vehicle. The log sheet, keys and cheque for the\ntotal bill (calculated on\nthe rear of the log sheet) must be returned in an envelope to me via the\nSouthside Messenger.\n(continued on page 6)\nA WEEK LT J THE U FE OF\nEm in8 Vf\\ ON APPLESY\niiii iv iy tT \u00a3or nt fei rer VAU& Qt-S* PT IT TSE TE*/*CH A<* A& \u00ab 0 T TO 0\nSHEET ft Ef tO gf tS) AVO MOT 4 5 t> MC F\\ D~&t) fit T CAST' see^ \u20acx r<*/6E K port r Mo ge ct-i/ er q "

Golfing Society\nIn recent years the1 C Golfing Society has bec ome something of a run-down organisation.\nThis decline has come about partly due to neglect though perhaps a more potent reason is\nthat golfers are unaware\nof the very fortunate\nposition they occupy at\nfC. Let me illustrate this\nby means of a comp ari son. For an entrance fee\nof 9 0 pan IC student\nautomatically becomes a member of Royal Mid Surrey Golf Club, a club\nwidely regarded as being\namongst the best in Southern England. For every round he plays\nthere he is charged 2 8 p(a fee we are hoping the\nUnion Will cover). For the rest of the world there is the problem of\nfirst getting one's name\non to a four year waiting\nlist (a list which cannot\nbe avoided unless one\nhas first obtained a Knighthood, a title quite\nhard to come by now a days, particularly as a student). Once one has found away on to this\nlist and waited four years\nthere is then an entrance\nfee of roughly \u00a3250 to\npay with an annual subscription of about \u00a3100\nlumped on top of that.\nAfter all this palaver one\nis then admitted into the\nranks of members and permitted to use the\ncourse. Thus, while the IC student merely pays\nhis 9 0 p and walks on to\nthe course, the poor old 'Rest of world' has four\nyears and \u00a3350 to contend with before he can even buy a golf ball. The only limit to the club's generosity is that\nonly 2 5 IC students are\npermitted this five-star\ntreatment. At present,\nonly 19 have done this\nso there is still room for\nsix new members.\nI should also add that\nthis year we are hoping\nto extend our fixture list\nand have matches every\nWednesday afternoon. 2\nThis article is intended to give some insight\ninto the I CGS. If there\nare any points not covered by this article,\nplease contact either myself or one of the committee members named\nbelow, all of Whom are in Civ. Eng. II.\nNigel Foster.\nCommittee:\nNigel Foster (capt.)\nBill Calderwood( v capt.)\nJules Dan (Hon. Sec.)\nAdrian Evans (Treasurer)\nMatch report\u201414th November\nIt was a confident IC\nteam that marched down to Royal Mid Surrey 'last\nWednesday. This confidence was based on a two-year unbeaten record in all matches, a record second to none.\n(The fact that we have\nnot played a match for\ntwo years should not detract from this). The opposition was a strong\nUC team, fresh from a convincing victory over\nPo rts m0uth Poly tech nic,a big name in golfing\ncircles! Promptly at 1 2 . 3 0\np.m., after an excellent\nlunch, the two teams\nrolled out to the first tee.\nIC superstar Bill Calderw ood drove off amid great applause, his brand-new ball flying\nlike a majestic eagle into\na nearby gorse bush. In\nspite of this minor a cci dent, he managed to\nclimb into a com man ding lead of three holes\nafter playing nine. After\nthis, however, things\ndid not go well for his opponent began to play\nspectacular golf, through\nwhich he managed to\ntake five of the next eight\nholes to clinch a two and\none victory.\nIn the other matches,\nRick Brown, a player as\nsteady as his Land-Rover\nmight suggest, lost to an\nopponent who produced a round of 71 (one over\npar to golfing fans), a score more attributable\nto the likes of Tony Jac klin than to a college stu-dent. Chris Wad dil use, a young player being\nnurtured with an eye to\nthe future, ate an extra\nhealthy lunch and his subsequent hiccups prevented him from playing\nto form. His defeat does\nnot represent a, victory\nfor UC so much as it\nquestions the quality of\nthe club's sardine sand-wi che s. Indeed, the lunch had a very strong effect on this match result, tan\nReed's hard-boiled egg\ncould only sustain him to the seventeenth and his 1 down defeat reflects the protein deficiency of battery hens'\neggs. Clive Pemberton,\nunused to raw onions,\ndecided to massacre his opponent. This he duly\ndid (8 and 7 ) . For those\nunfamiliar with golfing\nterminology this implies\nthat he won eight holes\nout of the eleven he had\nto play. In human terms\nthis represents one very\ndrunk UC student,\nclutching a tumbler of whisky muttering ' Mum my!'. Rumour has it that\nwhereas he used to describe golf as his forte,\nthis forte is now transferred to cushion-stuffing. Well, I expect that by now you're wondering What happened to the captain. Surely he didn't fall into the sardine\nsandwich trap, 'I hear you\ncry. Actually I did, even\nswilling it down with a pint. Having said that,\nI'm sure you can appreciate why I was four\ndown after seven holes.\nHowever, once I had the ball clearly in focus and had removed my opp on ent's glasses, I was back\nin the match and after\nsome nail-biting scenes\ntied the match at the last\nhole.\nThus we lost 4\u00a3-1\u00a3.\nHowever, I'm sure you would agree that with a good dietician, this result might have been\nswung in our favour.\nMy final thoughts on this matter are to commend the spirit in which both teams played, and to regret that our sole\nspectator was only capable of barking its sup-port.\nNigel Foster.\nWardens for Student flats\nIn the very near future\na warden will be required for the student\nflats in Ravenscourt\nPark. The job of this\nwarden will be very similar to that of the\nwardens in student hou-ses.\nAny interested, mar-ried, post graduate student should contact Norm Sayles (President) as\nsoon as possible.\n(N.B. FREE large flat\nwithin 3 0 minutes of\ncollege!).\nContinued From Page 1\n1 advise that one meeting of the Tenants' Association to be held this term,\nand that meetings be held every three\nweeks, while on Rent Strike. However,\nall major decisions should be made by\nreferendum, which I would consider a convenient, democratic and satisfying\nprocess.\n3. 'How do we control the funds\" is\nthe other basic question. The \" who controls\" part should be clear from\n2.\nIt is important to satisfy individuals\nthat their money will be safe in the\nfund. I advise that:\ni. 'ITie fund should be banked in its\nown deposit account: this allows\nfor speedy withdrawal or transfer\nof individual students' money, if\nthis is necessary. Further, if the\ninterest rate continues to rise (and\nthe College has no legal claim to\nthe interest, though its ethical\nclaim may be reasonable) there is\nthe possibility of a \"self-financing\"\nCampaign.\nPayees should be given proper receipts for the full amount they pay\ninto the fund.\nAny payee should b^ free to transfer his or her mr^ w at any time\nto the College A/c. The terms of r^e rer>. ce of the fund\nshould he such that under no circumstances can ths meme y paid in\nby students he med fr\n>ran v pur-pose, other than payment of residence fees owed to the College or\nfor payments of refunds to students who have p lacH their money\nin the fund.

Everyone thinks\nhe's dead . . . except our\nDavie, who exposes a very credible trail of\nsmall town deceit and crime. From this point of\nview the story is a really\nwell-told uno over ing pursuit in the classic sense; the dialogue is\ncrisply handled and the narrative hangs together.\nUnfortunately Hansen\neither cannot handle\nemotion, or has tried to\nput too much of a message into the book: our agents' affairs and heart-searching are dull and cloying, and spoil what\nwould otherwise be an enjoyable mystery story.\nCandi\nS.C.A.B.

This organisation aims to foster\nhigh standards of integrity 'in that pro-fess ion. It proclaims that the function\nof a Personnel Officer is to honestly\nattempt to solve industrial relations\nproblems, even if this involves disagreeing with their employer.\nDoes Mr. Malone measure up to\nthese admirable standards?\nIt is the view of the Branch Committee that he does not.\nThe College brought him in to im prove staff/Col leg e relations, at least\nthat was What the former Rector said\nat the time. The reverse has hap-pen ed. Never has there been such a bad and disgraceful situation as now s xi sts. NATIONAL AND LOCAL\nAGREEMENTS ARE BROKEN\nThe National Agreement requires\nthe post of Departmental Superintendent to be part of the Technical Staff\nstructure, if the work done is the\nsame as the Job Description in the\nBlue Book. Everybody knows that that\nis the case in this College, nevertheless the College will not comply with\nthis Agreement.\nWe have a local agreement that a special criteria should be used to decide whether Experimental Officers\nshould be regarded as Academic or\nTechnical Staff. We are sure that this\nis being broken, and that some \" blue eyed boys\" are being slipped through\nas para-Academics, when they do not\nmeet the criteria.\nEvery request by us to be able to\ncheck what has happened has been\nevaded.\nThere is a National Agreement\ncovering the way in which NonUnion people can appeal against their grad-in gs. This agreement involves our participation in the Appeals Committee.\nWe have now discovered that this is\nalso being secretly broken. NonUnion Experimental Officers who had been placed in the Technical Staff,\nbut believe that they should be ' Academics', are appearing before Special\nAppeals Committees, without either\nour knowledge or agreement. Our protests have been ignored.\nMonths ago we discussed with the\nCollege a request by us for direct\nA.S.T.M. S. representation on both the\nSafety & Training Committee. We were promised an early reply. Not\nonly has there been no reply, but we know that I.C. has since made a statement to the University Safety Officers\nCommittee that there should be no Union representation on any Safety\nCommittee.\nIn April last we made proposals to\nre grade a member of the Maintenance\nstaff who holds a responsible position.\nIt is our view that he should be\ngraded as a Maintenance Officer and pro pertly paid. In fact he is under-paid and graded as a Clerk. In the last\nmonth we have made three requests\nfor a meeting to clear the matter up, but have failed to get a meeting.\nSimilarly With the College Telephone Engineers. Hitherto they have\nbeen linked with the Technicians for\ngrading and pay. With restructuring\nwhat Will happen to them?\nRepeated requests for a meeting\nbring promises but no meeting.\nAll the above are but a selection of\nthe problems that we have been un able to solve. The most serious ques-tion, however, is the totally unacceptable situation on Restructuring of the\nTechnical Staff.\nRESTRUCTURING AND REGRADING\nThere were 1 4 9 appeals by Union members.54 have been heard, leaving 9 5 yet to be done. Every other\nLondon College has finished the entire\nprocedure, local, Regional and National level appeals. The absence of\nany effort by the College to complete\nthe exercise is due to an attitude of\ncontempt by them for the Technical\nStaff.\nMoreover, despite the fact that\nin some departments, notably Mechanical Engineering Department, the\nexercise was carried out in the most\ninefficient and biased manner, no attempt has been made to rectify the\nbad initial grading s. This has resulted\nin members being forced into the\nAppeals machinery quite unnecessarily, and with no guarantees of obtaining justice.\nThere has been extraordinary hap-Denings affecting individuals, even including attempts at intimidation. The case of our Branch Chairman, Arthur\nSier, being one of the worst. The Personnel Secretary told him quite\nbluntly that if he put his own case to\nappeal, then he would be made to regret it. Needless to say THOSE REMARKS were made to the wrong address!! So, where do we GO? Can we go\non like this?\nAbout a year ago, all of the Unions\nin the College met the College Secretary to request changes in the attitude\nof the Personnel Department. Promises were made but things are now worse than ever.\nIt is now becoming clear that normal negotiating channels are being\nclosed to us. This we will not tolerate.\nThere are other ways to get things\ndone and we must be prepared to use\nthem.\nOn behalf of the Branch Committee,\nH. Fairbrother\n(Secretary I. C.A.S.T. M.S.) LETTER OF COMPLAINT\nIam writing to com plain, on behalf of the\nIC Eco Action group and of the 7 0 to 1 0 0 people\nWho cycle to IC every\nday, about the lack of\nbicycle parking space.\nAccording to l.C. U.H on. Sec. Paul Wads worth, there are 8 7 bi cycle spaces at IC,\nwhich might be sufficient\nwere it not for the\nthoughtless motorcyclists who block the bi cycle racks with their\nmachines. Motorbikes\nhave stands and the only\nreason for parking in bi cycle spaces could be\nfor the shelter which some of them afford.\nMost bicycles do not\nhave stands and they\nneed a means of support:\nthe bicycle spaces. The Maintenance department\nhave said that they will put up a notice telling\nmotorcyclists not to park\nin the bicycle racks; we ask all motorcyclists to\nobserve this rule.\nMr. Wadsworth has\nsaid that you cannot expect to have a bicycle\nrack outside each depart-ment, and that he cannot\njustify expenditure on additional bicycle racks\nunless the present ones\nare filled and some bi cycles remain without\nspaces. So any cyclist\nwho wants more parking\nspace provided should\ntry to find space in a rack, and park there.\nWhile I have the op-port unity, I shall point\nout some ecological ad vantages of bicycles over\ncars. Cars gulp petrol, a limited and increasingly\nscarce resource now that\nthe oil /energy crisis is\nupon us; but bicycles J don't waste fuel. B icy cl j es generally last much I longer than cars (iron\nore is also limited re-source). Cars spew out\nstinking,choking exhaust\nfumes which are a hazard to health and to the\nenvironment (the earth\nis a refuse tip of limited\nsize). Bicycles are non polluting. Bicycles have\nother advantages, too:\ncycling is a good exercise; bicycles can slip\nthrough traffic queues,\nand are easy (??) to\npark. And here is one to\nthink about: more time\nis lost by the many\npeople who make it possible for car drivers to\ntravel at high speeds,\nthan is gained by the\ndrivers in travelling at\nthese speeds.\nYours,\nAdrian Robinson\n(Physics I) IC POWER CUTS Then read this\nFeeling bored?-article closely\nRoyal wedding, Arab mega loman ia, miner's overtime action, Israeli\ncolonialism, capitalist cataclysms in\nstocks and shares, American psychos es \u2014 do you feel that life isn't worth\nreading?\nSo man, throw off that heavy mill stone of the body and let your mind fly free.

Technological failures, earthquakes and other un for seen natural disasters,\nand human actions varying from carelessness to\ndeliberate sabotage have\nparticularly serious implications With nuclear\npower systems.\nAs far as the possibility and magnitude of\nmajor accidents involving the release of fission\nproducts to the atmosphere, this seems to vary\nwith the different types\nof reactor.\nThose of you who saw the \" Controversy\" programme on nuclear power a couple of months\nago will have heard Or. Ned Franklin of British\nNuclear Fuels estimate\nOn 13th January, 1 9 7 4\nthe right of individuals\ntG petition the European\nCommission of Human Rights, conceded by H.M. Government in\n1966, comes to an end. The Government has not\ncommitted itself to renewing this right. As recently as 24th October\n1 9 7 3 , the Under Secretary of State for Foreign\nand Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Anthony Royle,\nrefused to state the Government's intention, despite a series of questions\nin the House of Com mons from Mr. Fred\nWilley, Mr. David Steel\nand Sir Elwyn Jones\nemphasising the importance of renewal.\nThe N CCL is this week\nIau n oh ing a ca mpa ign to convince the Government of the need to\nrenew the right of in divi du a I petition for an\nindefinite period. We are\nseeking your help as we are convinced that it is\nthat maximum fatalities\nfrom an accident at one of the CO^-eo Oled reactors in use in Britain\nwould be in the hundreds, whereas Daniel\nFord ( Union of Concerned Scientists in the U.S.) quoted the U.S. Atomic Energy Com mis sion's figure of tens of\nthousands for their LWR( Light Water Reactor).\nN.B. this information\nwas classified by the\nA.E.C. to avoid spoiling their Public Relations\nimage.\nSubstantial questions\nhave been asked about\nthe safety of LWR s \u2014 in particular raising doubts\nabout the adequacy of the emergency core-cooling system.\nIn 1 9 7 2 the W. German government advisory committee on reactor safety recommend edam ori to rium on the\nlicensing of LWR s in\nGermany, pending further investigation.\nBritain is also considering whether to buy\nLWR s. If there are\ndoubts about the safety\nof present types of\nreactor, it seems necessary that a lot more research should be done\nand many more facts be made public before we either install hundreds of\nLWR s or introduce the\nnext generation of re ac tors, the fast'breeders.\nSo far I 've only referred to the dangers of\nreactor accidents. What is frequently regarded as\nthe most serious di sad vantage of the nuclear\nfission process is the\nsignificant amount of\nessential for every voluntary organ!s a tion,\npressure group and casework agency to make\nknown its views to the\nGovernment.\nIt maybe useful if I set out the background to the situation. The United Kingdom Government ratified the\nEuropean Human Rights\nConvention in 1 9 5 1 . The present par i ties to the\nConvention Who have\naccepted Ithe right of\nindividual petition are\nIreland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,\nWest Germany, Austria,\nNetherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg. Italy has announced her intention\nto accept this right.\nThe importance of the\nright for individual citizens to seek redress\nagainst breaches of the\nconvention committed by its own Government\ncannot be under es tim at ed. It is probably the\nmost advanced form of\nhighly radioactive waste\nproducts that have to be\nisolated for possibly\nthousands of years before they are safe. At present, high level\nwastes are stored in tanks and already there\nhas been at least one serious leakage in the\nStates.\nTechniques such as\nthe glass if i cation of wastes and storage in disused salt mines are\nbeing researched, but whatever is done there\nwill always be a need to\nmonitor the wastes \u2014 un less, of course, an out-of-sight, out-of-mind\nattitude is taken!\nThe transportation of\nnuclear fuels to and from reactors constitutes\nanother potential hazard,\nespecially if the fuel\ntransported is Plutonium. Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances\nknown to man(U.S. Federal health standards\nlimit human exposure to\na total body burden of\n0.6 micro gram). In add i tion, Plutonium' s half-life of 2 4 , 4 0 0 years\nwould mean that radioactive contamination in\nan area would be essentially permanent. The fact that it is quite possible to construct a crude atomic bomb with plutonium hi-jacked from\na shipment to a power\nstation is also worrying\na number of people.\nEnvironmental concerns over the nuclear\npower programme are\nconcentrated on the\naspects of( a) the general increase in the level\nof background radiation\nhuman rights protection\nin the world today.\niff the right of individual petition were not renewed, no citizen of\nthe United Kingdom would be able to take a case before the European\nCommission. Indeed, the\nEuropean Convention on\nHuman Rights would be ineffective: for While the Convention and its Protocols set out certain\nbasic rights and standards which each State\nundertakes to practice,\nthe number of cases\nbrought by one State\nagainst another are few and far between. The s dle inter-State case presently before the European Commission is that\nbrought by Ireland against the United Kingd om. This is only the\nfourth inter-State case 'in\n22 years.\nThe NC CL's view is\nthat at a time when Civil\nliberties are in danger of\ngradual erosion, no ac tion should be taken\nWhich withdraws an important protection of\nhuman rights.\nIndividual petitions\nwhich the Commission have considered or are\nconsidering reflect a wide range of issues\nalleging the denial of\nhuman rights in the U nin the atmosphere, (b) the enormous amount of waste heat that, in par-ti cula r, the present fission reactors produce\nand discharge, via their\ncooling water into rivers\nand lakes, and( c) the fact that present reactors\nuse uranium inefficiently,\ndepleting world reserves\nat a high rate, and that\nin the U.S., in order to\nconcentrate 2 3\n^ U for nu clear fuels, an increase\nin the strip-mining of\ncoal has been needed to\nprovide power for the\ngaseous diffusion plants.\nR em ember ing that there are other possible\nsources of energy (e.g. hydro-electric, solar and\ngeothermal), I think that\nthis conference will not\nonly try to assess the\nmost expedient way of\n\" going Nuclear\" but\nalso, I hope, will cons i der Whether the risks involved in any nuclear\nprogramme could be too\nhigh.\nWhatever viewpoint\nyou hold on the prospects of Nuclear Power,\nthis conference should\nprove very interesting.\nSpeakers include Professors T. Kibble and G. Walton from l.C., Brian\nWheatley from the C.E. G.B., Walt Patterson\nfrom Friends of the Earth and Prof. Roy Ellis\nfrom Leeds Medicine School.

Eng. 2 2 0 on Tuesday night. As I arrived\nshortly before 5.30 p.m. to hear Prof Brown deliver his Inaugural Lecture, I was struck by the\nvast numbers of Professors, Doctors, Lecturers\nand the like assembled there, chatting to one\nanother in What I would term as academic jovi-ali ty. It was largely this\nquality of audience present that led me to conclude that this was to be\nno ordinary lecture. It\nwas not.\nPromptly at 5.30 p.m. the learned speaker\nstrolled in, a picture of\nstyle and confidence. His\nsuit said it all; excellent\nright down to the rose in\nhis buttonhole. Indeed,\nsuch was his aplomb that\nalthough I have been lectured to by the learned\nprofessor on numerous\noccasions, my introduction to this performance\nbecame a case of being\nfamiliar with the speaker but unfamiliar with the atmosphere of the\noccasion. My early apprehensions were soon put to\nrest once he began his exposition. The sharp,\nengaging style of speech\nhad not Changed, nor had his diction, clearly\nto be heard in every part\nof the theatre.\nI should at this stage\nmention the subject on which he was lecturing.\nBeing a 'Structures Professor' he chose to look\nat 'Structural Analysis and Structural Failure'.\nIf the title appears pro-hi bit ive, the text was not. He opened by giving a broad outline of\nhow the ' analysis' methods of today developed\nfrom the 'trial and error'\nThis method was only\nsuperseded once the invention of language had become popularized.\nSurprisingly, he does not\ncondemn the 'trial and error' technique. Indeed\nhis admiration for the method is quite apparent in the case of its use\nin nature by such as the\nthrush in its nest build-ing, or the beaver in its\ndam constructions.\nThat language was the\nkey, there appears to be\nno doubt. Once knowledge was recorded, past\nerrors could be used\nbeneficially and mistakes\nmade by one generation\nneed no longer be repeated by the next, in deed once language was born, there was no idea\nof comparable magnitude required from then\non for man to reach his\npresent state of expertise in 'structural an aly sis'.\nIt was after this historical discussion that he\nmoved on to a most interesting subject, one I would describe as 'Beauty Analysis'. In\nthis he posed the question ' Why is it that one\ncan build Salisbury\nCathedral without the\nbenefit of Structural\nAnalysis, and yet it requires a century or two of research and an electronic computer to build\na multi-storey car park?' The most cogent reason\nhe gave was that whereas structural analysis\nmay make a structure\nsafe, ' it will not make\nthem ugly either' but in\ntoo many cases this side\nof affairs is allowed to\nbecome subservient to\nthe more scientific structural analysis.\n(continued on page 8)\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nOF HUMAN RIGHTSNCCL campaign for renewal\nof rights of individual\npetition at Strasbourg\n\n"

About \u00a33,000m. was wiped off share values\nSn the last three days of last week.\nDespite a statement in the Sunday Times of ten days ago saying that\nthe miners go slow would not have\nany effect until Christmas, Home Secretary Robert Carr said in Parliament\nannouncing the state of emergency:\n\" The Government consider that the\npresent situations in the coal and electricity generating industries constitute a threat to the essentials of\nlife of the community which is sufficiently serious to justify taking im mediate emergency powers to maintain essential services\". However there is no doubt that the\ncrisis on the stock exchange was sparked off by the announcement of a record balance of payments deficit of\n\u00a3298m. for October which prompted\nsevere and unexpected credit restrictions. The Bank of England withdrew \u00a3600m. from the banking system by\n(increasing special deposits to 6 % of\n'liabilities and raised the Minimum Lending Rate from 1 1 1 % to 1 3 % bypassing the procedure by which the\nML R is determined by the average\nweekly Treasury Bill Rate.\nOn Wednesday the two-tier system\nfor gold was scrapped in a Washing ton announcement which leaves only\n\u2022the free market price for the dollar\n(about $ 9 5 for a fine ounce of gold).\nThe balance of trade deficit figure\ndoes not take into account imports\nnot checked at Heathrow due to a strike of import-checking computer\noperators.\nBasically the emergency regulations\nallow for the direction of ships, road\nhaulage, trains and passenger carry-ing vehicles to. carry Whatever the\nGovernment wants without regard to\nlicences, plating certificates or other\nregulations bar certain aspects of\nthird party insurance.\nAlso electricity, gas, water and sewage can be reallocated according\nto the direction of the Government.\nLand, buildings and ail transport\ncan be requisitioned at the request of\n(the Government.\nPerhaps the most important clause\nis Number32 Which makes interference with essential services an act of\nsabotage for which one can be fined\n\u00a3100, jailed for 3 months or both.\nThis can apply to large sections of\nthe trade union movement should\nthey go on s rike and, considering the\npresent state of the economy, will be\nused in the near future With the most\nviolent results.\nUGM\nGREAT HALL\nThursday,\n1 p.m. Chile\nGrants\nAccommodation\nBRUNEL RED FACES\n'Izzie Soc' from Brunei University\nwho had the gall to remove Guilds plaques from Guilds Union Office,\nhave returned them as they are in violate.\nSlight damage was agreed by the Council to be considered as' honourable war wounds' after as ug ges tion from Paul Gee. RENT STRIKE:\nAims, Structure, and\nConsequences\nPREAMBLE1 have been instructed by Council to\ndraft a Constitution for a Rent Strike\nFund. To this end, I have examined\nvarious aspects of the Rent Strike and\ncompiled the following short paper.\nBACKGROUND Primarily, 'the Rent Strike proposed,\nis a tactic within the Grants Campaign\nand should be seen as such. Until last\nyear, the tactic was used on a local\nlevel, in pursuance of local objectives.\nHowever, during '72-73 some 45 Colleges, Universities and Polys went on Rent Strike, and it has now become\nwidely regarded as an effective tactic.\nMuch debate now centres around the\nquestion of whether the Rent Strike\nshould now become a Nationally Co ordinated Tactic, or remain locally\nrooted.\nThe major argument for the National\nRent Strike is that the start of such a phase in the campaign would encourage\nmany more Colleges to go on Rent\nStrike. The major argument against is\nthat the real work must be done by\nlocal Student Union Officers, anyway,\nand no-one wants Ehdsleigh Street\nsticking their noses in. However,\nnationally co-ordinated responses may\nbe necessary to face up to attacks by College Authorities.\nAIMS\nThe main aim of the tactic is clearly\nto highlight the inadequacy of the main rate. Rent Strike is not an economic\nweapon. Last year, \u00a32m.in toto was\nwithheld, a paltry sum by national\nstandards.\nIts value lies in that it drama tis es the\nCampaign, and involves large numbers\nof students. The Rent Strike must be\naccompanied by a massive publicity\neffort, both outside and inside Halls,\nHouses, and College. If the tactic is to\nbe sustained, a very deep political\nunderstanding by the Rent Strikers\nthemselves of the tactic as part of the\nCampaign is necessary.\nLEGALITY It is quite clear that Rent Strike is a political action and that it is quite im possible to produce any justification for\nthis action. The two basic forms of\naction open to the College are:\ni Legal action through the courts,\nti Internal action, either as an administrative decision or as part of\nthe disciplinary process.\nORGANISATION In considering the way the tactic is\nto be organised I have tried to take into\naccount the experiences of past strikes\nand apply the appropriate tactics to IC. Three basic questions confronted me\nin this section:\n1. How much of the rent do we with-hold?\n2. How do we withhold it?\nand\n3. Who controls the funds, and how?\n1. Two choices present themselves;\neither we keep the whole lot or just\nthe difference1( rent minus notional\nelement). A tIC, with relatively low\nrents, it would seem that were we\nto take the latter course, we might\nbe returning some money to the\nCollege!\nI think that the only course here,\nis to withhold the whole fee.\n2. This is a crucial question. Clearly,\nthe money cannot be under the individual control of those withholding rent. This would\ni. Deny an efficiently run, well-knit\n\" organisation, without anyone\nknowing who has withheld rent.\nii. Open individual students to vic-tim is ation by College Authorities.\nTwo other options are open:\n(a) the collective control of the rent-strikers.\n(b) the control of the Union.\n(b) may be the more immediately\nattractive choice, as the Union structure is probably capable of absorbing\nthe necessary changes and additions.\nHowever, in campaigning terms, it is\nessential that the Rent Strikers feel\nthat their money is under their own control, and separate from the Union Structure.\nAt the present time it would seem\ninadvisable to place the funds in the\ncontrol of the U GM, Council, or Union Executive. I believe that it would be\nfar more appropriate to set up a Tenants' Association, which would control\nthe funds directly. All residents in Hall or House would be members automatically. The Tenants' Association would be\nrun by a Committee, elected by the\nresidents themselves, by ballot. Each Hall or House .would elect its own reps.; but the number of reps, would be\nallocated on a basis of, say, 1 for 50\nresidents.\nThe Committee would then elect its\nown Chairman, Secretary, and Treasurer\nand Assistant Treasurers (3 would be a good number). These would be the\nOfficers of the Tenants' Association,\nand Trustees (or bailee s) of the Rent.\nFund. It might be advisable for the\nCommittee to liaise closely with the\nUnion Council, but the essential point\nis that residents themselves be seen to be in control of the money.\nIt might be argued that this isolates\nthose on Rent Strike from other stu-dents, not in Hall. However, this might\nbe said of the tactic itself, and also I must emphasise that not many students\nwould wish their money to be under\nthe control of aUG M. The U GM, however, might serve as a forum for discussion between non-st rik ers and strikers, and would always be\nable to make recommendations to the\nCommittee of the Tenants' Association.\nIt is suggested that the election of\nthis body proceed with all haste and\nthat its first taste, this term, be to work\nout' a Constitution for the Tenants'\nAssociation, and have it approved by a majority (2/3?) of its residents. Alternatively, the proposals might be worked\nout by someone from this Committee,\nor from the U GM or Council, and be\npresented to the residents.\ncontinued on page 6\n\n"

The N CCL accepts\nthat cases of this nature\nfrequently embarrass\nGovernments. International supervision of this\nkind is bound to be uncomfortable on occasions. Yet it is precisely\nthis discomfort which justifies the existence of\nthe right of individual\npetition. Moreover, if\nthis right were allowed\nto lapse, it would represent a blow not only to\nthe protection of human rights in the United\nKingdom but would significantly undermine the\nConvention in Europe as\na whole.\nYour organisation is\nalready playing a vital\nrole in the protection of\nhuman rights. The N CCL is making its own contribution to the campaign but the true success of this campaign depends on an emphatic\nresponse from organisations such as your own. It is important for the\nGovernment to see that a large number of agencies\nand organisations care\nabout this issue.\nWe are therefore asking you:1. to make your org-an is at ion's view known\nby writing to the Prime\nMinister asking that the\nright of individual petition be renewed for an\nindefinite period;\n2. where appropriate,\nto persuade your members to lobby their MPs by seeking personal interviews in their con-st it u enc ies;3. to let the N CCL know any action you\nhave taken.\nIf you require any\nfurther information or\nmaterial- please do not\nhesitate to contact either\nmyself or, the NC CL's Legal Officer, Larry\nGrant.\nYours sincerely,\nMartin Loney,\nGeneral Secretary.\nContinued from page 4\nMuch of the latter\npart of the lecture involved the various techniques no wat the disposal of analysts, some of\ngreat elegance, others\nby necessity crude.\nThese I shall not discuss\nhere as these methods\nare not to be read in\nabbreviated form by\nsomeone inept in these\nmatters but should be\ndevoured from either the\noriginal manuscript or\nsome suitable textbook.\nSuffice it to say that several methods were dis-cussed, none to any\ngreat depth.\nThus, to summarise, I felt the slides, text, and\ngeneral presentation\ncame over very well. My only complaint would be\nthat the demonstrations\nwere skated over too\nquickly to serve much purpose.\nFinally, for those who indulge in the study of\nthe Classics, here is a mouth watering quote\nfrom Prof. Brown.' You might say VitruVius built\nthe most successful\nigloos of his day'. There\nis no answer to that!\nSir,\nI have recently obtained a copy of the.\nGuilds Handbook ' Span ner'. There are one or\ntwo points Which I would like to explain to any\nguilds burke Who is feeling just a little confused\nby this strange publica-tion. Firstly, on page\n22. It is apparent that\nMr. Osborne had been\nfrightened by a ghost,\nimmediately prior to having his photo taken. I aim\ntold by well informed\nsources that Stewart\nMorrison is part-time\nchimney sweep.\nOn page 22 Charlie\nLewis can be seen showing his true desire. Ri ding on the Mayor of\nMaidenhead's Parking\nSpace. On page 10 we see Tariq attempting to\nrepent his sins by paying\nhomage to the RCS Union Office. Unfortunately we wouldn't let\nhim in until he had been\nRag Chairman for a year\nas a pen nance. However\nin view of his claim on page 11 that guilds prod u ced several floats for\nlast year's Rag procession (well, if they did then they must have gone\non some other Rag pro-cession, because they\ncertainly did not appear\non ours!) I think we won't let him in anyway.\nYou may not think this\nletter is worth printing\nAli, but 1 think it will be\nan improvement on the\ncontinual pro-left or pro-right letters which seem\nto be the present vogue.\nYours (for a small fee)\nDr. R.U. Pionatee-Anag.\nC&G CARNIVAL Not having attended a C.&G. carnival before, I went to this year's hoping that my deprivation of beauty\nsleep would be well rewarded, which,\nI'm happy to say it was. The night was\nwell organised, there was plenty of\nroom to move about and the stocks of\nfood and drink seemed to last quite well\ntoo, even if they were a little ex pen sive. For those people so inclined there\nwas a disco in operation every time I went past, and I must admit I was quite\nsurprised that when I put my head\nround the door, I could both see more\nthan the end of my nose, AND hear\nmyself think.\nThe only thing that piqued me was\nthat when they started, at 9.30, after a couple of Donald Duck and Pluto car-toons, Mike A bso lam and Ace were\nboth playing at the same time. Having enjoyed Mike A bso lam very much last\nterm when he supported Roy Buchan nan, I made my way quickly to the\nJ. C.R. to grab a seat. For those of you\nwho missed him both times round, he\nplays a very carefully worked out set,\nwhich comes over as one entity. It links\nup his satirical songs (mostly with regards to sex, drugs and violence), sung\nin a multitude of different voices, with\nthe adventures of the fictitious Hiro nimo us, both of which are served with a liberal helping of puns, ranging from\ncorny to clever. The listener has to be\nvery sharp indeed to even catch most\nof them, which may be the reason people come to see him twice, though he\ndoes play some very nice tunes as well.\nI did sacrifice 10 minutes of his show\nto see how Ace were doing in the Great\nHall, and although it's difficult to form\na true impression in so short a space\nof time, they seemed to be - a straight\ncollege rock band, and I enjoyed more\nwatching the Mr. Gumbies lumbering\nabout not unlike hippos with bunions.\nBees Make Honey, a band who are\njust beginning to be noticed, rushed\nstraight over from another gig, and\nthus were inevitably late. They played\nquite consistently throughout their set\nof rhythm and blues with some very\nnice flourishes on guitar. Frankie\nMiller, their co-lead singer, is capable\nof sounding similar to Joe Cocker, and\n1 was disappointed that he wasn't more\nto the fore. All the same, they went\ndown well, and came back for an\nencore of rock and roll.\nNot long after, the Fairports came\non in the darkness, and started with a quickie, followed by the traditional\n\" The Hens March Through The Mid den, And The Four Poster Bed\", the\nfirst of many from the \" Rosie\" album,\nwith Dave Swarbrick using his fiddle\nto sound something like, I suppose, a chicken.\n\" Tokio\", one of their newer compositions and written (would you believe\nit) in Japan, featured some interplay of\nfiddle and guitar, and was followed with\nanother in the same vein, Swarbrick's subtle side coming over strong.\nAfter a few solo spots, of which I liked best Jerry Donahue's clever piece\non the guitar, they followed with two\nsongs in which they could all have a go\nat singing, Trevor Lucas's rich voice\neasily distinguishable from the others.\nThey finished, as usual with some jigs\nand reels.\nTo round the evening off I went to\nsee Callinan Sly mm, who played 12-string and 6-string guitars, though they\nseemed to be little different from those\nyou can find in most folk-clubs up and\ndown the country, so I went home for\na cup of coffee and a game of bridge.\nG.

The conference established the Broad Left Journal, the first issue of which will be available soon.\nThe Broad Left is not a tightly knit party with a membership and a manifesto. It is a group of students spread all over the country who agree with the\nconcept of a broadly^based left student movement\nand who feel that such a movement is worthy of\nsome personal commitment, and that the journal is\nintended as a forum for discussion, on which to base\na left student movement Which is both self critical\nand rooted in a fundamental unity of approach to\nmajor problems.\nAs a student organisation the Broad Left has as its prime point of reference higher and further education and NUS's role as the major student organisation within it. But it is also a Left organisation\nwhich must relate its ideas and actions to a far\nwider range of issues.\nThe Broad Left is founded in the belief that the\nstudent movement must be a popular movement in Which the majority of students are actively and critically involved. Despite the spectacular growth\nof NUS and the success of its campaigns, it is glaringly obvious that the mass of students do not\nregard themselves as primarily political animals,\nlet alone activists. 'But it is equally obvious that the\nmajority of students are concerned with the quality\nand purpose of their education, are concerned with\nthe quality of social and cultural life in our society,\nand are concerned with a great range of national\nand international issues.\nTies With the Trade Union movement need to be\nstrengthened, its Journal will help to provide the\nlinks that will integrate this variety of concerns\nand dissatisfaction s Which has made the student\nmovement a powerful force.\nThere are many issues that the journal will take\nup. The implications of the White Paper on Education should be studied closely and exposed. The campaign for a realistic and universal grant is not\n/et won, the crisis in accommodation is far from\naver.\nTies between the student movement and the\ntrade union movement need to be strengthened\nfurther not only because as organisations we represent two sections of the society opposed to capital-is m but because wage labour is the destination of\nnearly every student and, conversely education to\nany level should be the right of every worker.\nThere needs to be more discussion on the left about\ndevelopments in music, literature, and the arts.\nSimilarly our reactions to the deterioration of the\nenvironment need to be given more expression.\nOppression of nations in the Third World is traditionally an area of student concern. Broad Left\nwill continue to publicise such oppression and attempt to actively involve students in ending it.\nin Britain, harassment of minority groups and a rapid erosion of our civil liberties continues unabated. If the Journal is to do what it sets out to do, highlight these many issues and activate the student\nmovement around left policies, it requires an active\nsupport from those who are in basic agreement\nWith the aims outlined here and a readership that is\nready to make its own contribution to the debate.\nABroad Left grouping at IC has already been\nestablished and hopes to help in development of\nstudent consciousness- within this the selling of the\nBroad Left Journal will be very important.\nCopies of the Journal will be available from Mary Attenborough, Maths I; Joe Herbertson, Metallurgy\nPG; Trevor Phillips, Chemistry3.

He then goes\non to ask on what freedom is, specifically in terms\nof how It is applied in practice in Eastern Europe\ncountries to minority groups, in particular towards\nreligious groups.\nA person's 'rights' depend on a Whole series of\nfactors particularly how man ' bends' the laws of\nnature to meet his own needs \u2014 that is the mode of\nproduction capitalism, feudalism or whatever: i.e. under feudalism in Britain it was the 'right' of\nserfs to work34 days a week on their own plot of\nland in return for working the rest of the week on the landlord's. Under capitalism in Britain for a long period the worker had the 'right' to 'free'\ncollective bargaining with his employer over wage\nrates and working conditions. It is recently that the\nstate has through the pay laws and the industrial\nrelations act attempted to erode this 'right'. Under\nfascism in Germany in the 1 9 3 0 ' s workers had no\nsuch rights. The conclusion must be that a person's organising strength (in the case of the working class\nthe trade unions) against the organising strength of\nthe set of persons wanting to reduce the former's rights (which would be the employees through the\nuse of the state machine i.e. the police force escorting scabs across picket lines, the army sent in to\nstrike break, and the law as With the pay laws). Thus a person's rights fluctuate according to the\ndevelopment of the class struggle so there are no\nbasic rights. In a fascist society workers have no\nrights as all independent working class organisations are smashed and at the other end of the spectrum after a socialist revolution that is in a workers' state the bosses have no rights).\nTo clarify the confusing terms Maurice used in\nhis letter, it must be pointed out that Eastern European countries, Russia and China are not socialist.\nThey are dominated by bureaucracies which put\ntheir own interests before the working class. But the\nmode of production is different, that production is planned (what would be the basis of a socialist\neconomy) as opposed to production in capitalist\ncountries Which is geared round the market. Hence\nin that sense the productive forces are progressive\n(degenerate because an elite section of the working\nclass the bureaucracy has evolved which controls\nthe economy for its own interests). The degenerate\nworkers' states have on the one hand some of the\nold contradictions of capitalism such as the way commodities are distributed through the market\nwhilst on the other hand production is planned according to use value (often in the interests of the bureaucracy) as opposed to production\nfor profit in the West. Likewise the social contradictions of the old mode of production (capitalist)\nis reflected in the new( socialist), among them a degree of repression of minority groups. Within religious groups individuals should be allowed to\npractise their own religion if they so wish \u2014 BUT religion is a private matter that is it should not be imposed on people as happens through state institutions such as schools in capitalist countries.\nAre Maurice and other members of God Soc.\nserious about their concern of repression of minority groups?\nHOCKEY\nImperial showed right from the start of this UL U cup match against St. Barts Hosp. that they Were\nthe more skilful, more ingenious and more hardworking team.\nThe team, including several UL players, soon\nsettled down and after a period of pressure on the\nBarts' goal Mick Downs smashed a well-hit cross\nfrom Jag Gah ir past a stranded Barts' goalkeeper.\nBarts came out after half-time obviously after\nthe equalise r, but it never came because Mick Downs smashed another goal past the dreaming Barts' goalkeeper after about five minutes of play.\nBarts then threw everything they had at us, and\nafter soaking up continual pressure Barts managed\nto break-us down and they scored a good goal.\nStraight from the bully Barts started the pressure\nagain but this time after a fine break from defence\nJag Gahir scored to make the final score 3-1 to\nImperial College.\nThe cup team was: M. Downs( capt.), J. Gahir,\nD. Whittington, K. Boulton, R. Cameron, M. Thatcher, T. Hanson, A. Brown, K. Ross, D. Han son,G. Popple.\nOn Sunday, 11th November IC played two teams\nin the UL six-a side tournament. The second VI were\neliminated but the 1st VI after one walkover and an\na as y game against Westfield found themselves in the\nquarter-finals. Here we defeated UC2 nd VI 2-0 and\nwent on to face UC Tst VI in the semis. Unfortunately we went down20 to what turned out to be the\neventual winners, A.B. If they are serious about defending all minority\ngroups except the capitalist class and 'its allies in both capitalist and degenerate workers' states\nagainst repression then they would be prepared to\ncampaign on the one hand for such issues as the release of Ivan Dzyuba and Vy aches lov Chor nou il, two Ukranian socialists recently imprisoned for\norganising a socialist oppositional grouping in the Soviet Union; on the other hand for the removal of British military and economic oppression in Ireland.\nThere should beat least one issue we ought to have common agreement on, that is the fight against\nfascism. The National Front is a fascist organisation which is using racism as a pole of attraction for all kinds\nof racist scum and see legislation like the immigration laws as a green light for the go ahead for their\nracist activity. Not only does racism divide the working class but it offers no solution to the problems working people face \u2014 soaring inflation, in creasing repressive legislation, housing shortage,\netc. The reason why the fascist groups are backed by big business is that on the one hand they in crease divisions within the working class and at the\nsame time are used as the ' illegal' arm of the state\nto smash up trade union meetings and \u2022left wing organisations. That is, What the police don't want to be seen openly doing, a group of private thugs can do instead.\nToday in Italy the MSI (a sister organisation of\nthe National Front) can muster a vote of 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0\nwhereas the Communist Party (CP) despite the fact\nthat it can get five times the MS I's vote in elections\nhas to hold its meetings in hiding in southern Italy,\nwhere the MSI dominate, for fear of having their\nmeetings broken up, likewise with trade union meet-in gs. It is precisely because the CP in Italy today\nlike Allende in Chile, like the left groups in the 3 0 ' s in Italy and Germany argued that the fascists must be stopped by democratic means and not by force\nthat fascism has been allowed to grow. It is only in\ncountries like Britain and France in the 3 0 ' s where\nsections of the organised working class broke up fascist meetings that they stopped its growth. The lessons from history are clear that any rights we have, we must defend, that means ensuring \" no platform for fascists\". The National Front is as yet\nnot a mass threat because it is still a relatively small organisation (although gaining up to 2 0 per cent in\nrecent by-elections). It is BECAUSE it is not a mass\norganisation that it is possible to stop the National\nFront by force. Should it become a mass organisation it will be too late.\nAt Imperial College that would mean that we would be opposed in principle to the NF using either Union or College facilities Which would in clude opposing the sale of NF literature such as Spark in College or Union premises. No one who claims to believe in\" freedom\",\" basic rights\", can\nseriously argue for equal rights to an organisation\nWhich once given will attempt to destroy the \" deg ree of freedom\" we have at present. If those members of God Soc. are seriously concerned about\nrepression they will support the mounting campaign\nagainst the NF. Jock Ve all. Some Collected Thoughts\nIt is, I consider, the moral duty of students to col lect money for charities. This is one of the few ways in which we manage to perform some immediately useful function to society. If one concedes\nthat it is our duty When we should examine our pos i tion to find out What is our potential. It would be pot too difficult to collect \u00a3150 every Saturday \u2014\nthat's pure collecting \u2014 say24 weeks would give us \u00a33,600\u2014then addon \u00a3900 from selling 1 0 , 0 0 0\nrag mags, would give us \u00a34,500, assume 2 4 weeks of Wednesday afternoons at \u00a3100 and we have another \u00a32,400 to give us a sub total of \u00a36,900.\nNow that is What I consider to be the reasonable\npotential of South Kensington. However, we have\na wider potential, we're a London Rag and as such\nhave a huge audience \u2014 which we could exploit with benefit concerts. Both pop and classical. Now we have the organisation to collect the\nmoney in the constituent colleges \u2014 an excellent\ncompetitive structure. It is however the duty of IC\nto provide the organisation to 'inveigle money out of the rest of them.\nAnnouncement.\u2014There will be aRag Concert\nnext term \u2014 we need help.\nTariq U Lol ley, Rag Coordinator.
