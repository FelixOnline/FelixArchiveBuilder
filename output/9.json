    "content": "- 2 -SPEAKING PERSONALLY,\nWhen writing the Editorial this week I found that there were a number of things I wished to say which could not properly be said in an Editorial, since they were purely personal sentiments. I therefore decided to grant myself space for a personal article. We who started Felix did so in the belief that there was\na need for a paper which would report, publicise and comment\nupon College activities, and provide entertainment without!\ndeteriorating into a \"Muckrake.\" As it turned out, the provision of entertainment has proved the hardest requirement, but the experiment seems to have been a success and Felix is Well established. Although the paper is financially responsible to Council, and exists by their consent, it is free to express such opinions as it sees fit. The Felix Board therefore carries a considerable responsibility, for in the hands of irresponsible persons the paper could be a powerful and mischievous weapon, In that event\nit would undoubtedly be suppressed, and I should be extremely sorry to see that happen. I hope, therefore, that future Felix Boards, will bring new ideas and new life to the paper, but will maintain essentially the same spirit, I should like to thank all the members of the Board for their hard work and cooperation, and particularly Mr. CM, Har.greaves for having shouldered much of the editorial work\nand responsibility. Special thanks, also, to Miss Larcom and the Books tall staff for having produced the paper, by hand and always on time, and for her ready cooperation when trouble arose. It may not be generally appreciated that each issue involves putting the sheets through the Roneo machine over 10,000 times. E.M. Hughes.\nThe Refectory Committee.\nThe Committee met on 22/5/50, and after the usual preliminary business discussed the question of the reduction of\nSell ars, with the result already known.\nThe dissatisfaction in some quarters with the ticket system In the New Lounge was then raised, and the suggestion put forward that, as an experiment', a crush rail be installed, with a cash register and desk at the end. Apart from the fact that the Dancing Club, who use the room three nights a week,\nwould not like the idea, and the fact that we had no cash\nregister available, the main objection was that it would almost\ncertainly cause the service to be slower. When the ticket system was first Introduced the queue was timed, and the average\ntime was found to be about a quarter of what it had previously been when cash 'was taken at the counter. In view of this it was decided that the ticket system should be retained, in spite of its minor irritations. The idea of putting on a cheap lunch a tl/6d was then\ndiscussed. It was felt that when Mr, Coomber put the idea to the Union General Meeting the full significance of the suggestion was not appreciated, and that it would be well worth while to try it as an experiment for a fortnight. By the time this appears the experiment will have been going for a week, and it is hoped\nthat it will provide the answer to those who require a satisfying lunch at a low price. In any case, the Committee will be glad to have your opinions, The suggestion that the Refectory be handed over to\" private contractor was the next topic. It was pointed out that J.J. Lyons\n\n"

Supported hy\nBo and. a strong I.C. contingent on the bank, \"A\" crew heat the\nR.A.P. by f length in their first heat, their start being very good. In the next heat they lost to Thames R.C., which crew\nyour rowing correspondent, with a breaking heart, had to force on to win by half a length, he having been press-ganged into it at the last moment.\nThe \"A\" crew should not be disappointed at this result. They showed quite clearly that they are well up to Junior Standard no mean feat in such an inexperienced crew. Their exploits after the regatta in rowing an extra two miles to take their boat back to Molesey testifies to their keene s s( even though they were not entirely sober at the time). The keene s s,hard work and Intent ability in the \"A\" and\n\"B\" crews augurs well for the future, as the majority of both crews will be here for two years and some for three. Lawn Tennis - The University Cup.\nThe Clip presented to the Winners of the University InterCollegiate Lawn Tennis Championship is one which will not be\nparaded around the Union on the finals day by its drunken\nwinners in1950. For I.C., having held the respected but\nun coveted position of runners up for the last two years have\nbeen, knocked out In the second round, by Queen Mary College, apparently not contented by inflicting the same Ignominy on\nthe Rugger Club earlier In the Year. I.C., although they had not been extended to beat Battersea Poly by 8-1 in the first round, did not face the prospect of\nmeeting Queen Mary with confidence, since the strength of the\nopponents first pair, Claus sen and Turner, was well known.\nThey, and the I.C. first pair Watson and Wilson had done battle several times at University Trials, and both pairs had represented the University. It seemed then that this rubber might provide the key to the whole match, Watson and Wilson started well, taking the first set62, playing in their best( but only too\nrare) form. Quickly they took the lead31 in the second, and\nseemed well on the road to victory. Then tragedy occurred. Wilson had lost his service and along series of deuces was\nbeing fought out on Claus sen's. In taking an easy volley Watson\nslipped on the damp surface and fell hurting his knee. It transpired that this proved the turning point of the match,\nfor in the next game Watson served badly to give the Queen Mary\npair the lead which they never again lost' running out winners266362. The failure of their first pair in this important match\nappeared to de moral is e the I.C. team, for Smith and Welch\nended the afternoon with a blank score sheet and Swain and\nRussell beat only the opponents third pair. In due respect to the Queen Mary players they must be congratulated however in turning out a team which was as stray at the tail as at the\nhead. The whole team played a little better than the I.C. team,\nthe difference was indeed slight, for many rubbers ran into three sets, the last of these providing entertainment in the\ngathering dusk for the dancers on their way to the Saturday night hop.\nQUICK WAY OUT.\nMembers of I.C., whatever their emotions on the days of\ntheir examinations, are not recommended to follow the recent example of a student in Egypt who, while being orally examined\nby an English Professor, pulled out a gun and shot the Professor In the arm,\n\n"

It is this roadside entrance under\nthe sign of an old sailing ship that is probably the oldest part of the Prospect about 400 years, although claimed by\nsome, with forgivable exaggeration, to be 600 years old. But\nit is the riverside front of the inn which has the most especial charm; a rakish assembly of beams and boarding and the long flight of the wooden Pelican Stairs leading up from the mud\nto the dingy street. Visited by many it has been the haunt of Sir Hugh\nWilloughby, Sir Martin Frobisher and Judge Jeffrey s who is said to have enjoy od the grim spectacle of the victims he had\ncondemned swinging from the gibbets of the Execution Dock\nnearby. Pepys and Dr. Johnson too are old associates, the\nupper dining room commemorating the former by its name - Ye\nPepys Room. If visiting this room it is wise to notice the\nfittings which In a twinkling converted the room into a prize ring; a thing that was often done.\nDickens In \"Our Mutual Friend\" calls it the \" Six Jolly Fellowship Porters\" and describes it as \"a narrow lopsided wooden jumble of corpulent windows heaped one upon another ....\nwith a crazy wooden verandah impending over the water,\" To-day it is perhaps best to s it on the lower balcony with a pint of \" best\" and watch the river traffic moving\nabout Rother hi the to the accompaniment of riverside sounds\nand smells; or if one is more accustomed to drinking with song\none should return to the bar. There amid the festooned trophies of all ages and lands a to poe from Africa, a Stetson from\nAustralia, kris from Java, ships lanterns and an occasional un beautiful cherub - one can listen to the three man Hawaiian band or join it in song as they play through their enormous\nrepertoire. In that fog of smoke and heat one will rub shoulders with EastEnders' at home, West Enders on a night out, tourists from America, sailors and students who have come to see this famous pub and stayed to enjoy its unique atmosphere.\n\n"

The decision was made, of course, in the interests of economy, but this will in fact be small, since another person will have to be employed to take over his duties\" behind the scenes,\" such as store keeping. He was the person whom people usually cited when they\ncriticised the Refectory for being over staffed, apparently believing that he did nothing but stand and look like a butler. In pandering to these critics, and to achieve what is really a trifling economy, the Committee have lost us the services of one who, at the least, lent an air of dignity to the Dining Hall and provided one of the differences between Imperial College and other less august colleges. We must not, however, be unfair to the Committee, for although there are many who will feel a pang of regret that Mr.\nSell ars has been sacrificed, atleast it shows that the Committee\nare prepared to take any steps that may be necessary to put its finances in order. In our last issue we noted that in an article In The\nObserver, I. C.had been credited with the invention of the term\n'!brown b agger.\" In their next issue appeared a letter stating that the term was known to be in use a tU.C. in1925, but we\nwere surprised to see that no reply to this letter appeared\nthis week. Has the Editor closed the correspondence, or can\nit be that no one a tI.C. has taken the trouble to write? The term appears in a Phoenix of1918, which alone disposes of the U.C. claim, but it also appears In one of\nH.G. Wells' books, and it is not un reason al be to suppose that he\nacquired the expression when he was at this College.

These fair ones among our dark and brooding brows provide just that amelioration of scenery so desirable between the yearly round of club dinners and exams.\nThe I.C.

Come 11.45 a.m. the I.C.e leven( possibly weakened by a few traitorous defections) trickled from the \" Dorchester Arms\"\nand took the field. Eric Waight bowled one of the opening\nbatsmen in his first over, but thereafter play continued sedately. Later Useless celebrated his return to first class cricket with a nonchalant one-handed catch on the boundary: and there was a run out. With Hook 59-3 I.C. returned smartly to the \"D.A.\" After lunch the attack was noticeably blunted. Useless retired to extra cover clasping his stomach and a series of\nCharlie' s, Gordon's, and Jack's with gigantic forearms refused to see any subtlety in the great hearted bowling of Weak and\nRambaut. Hook were eventually out for238, by which time Roy\nSevern in the deep field was in good training. Waight emerged\nfrom the holocaust with5 wickets for47. I.C. began un auspiciously, losing Weale, Claop and Rambaut\nfor21 runs, but Dick Morphy and Pete Davies, I.C.^s indomitable captain, stayed together and the teatime score was 80-3. After tea Pete began to hit four s to either side of the sight screen alternately, to the evident chagrin of bowler Charlie and his deep fields men who was oscillating out of phase. The score was 116 and the pair put on 95 before Morphy was caught off amiss hit for39. At this point the I.C. ship unaccountably turned turtle and sank. Dai Nicholas went down the o itch to Charlie and failed to return. Roy Severn, Derek Allen and Useless followed rapidly. Pete was out for a splendid62( ten4>s), and the innings ended for122 with Waight utterly bowled as\nHe hit a hypothetical six, And so to the \" Dorchester Arms\" again, led by umpire\nAlan Dark. We were defeated at darts but held our own in other departments, and had a monopoly of Zulu songs. Even the three who made ducks were . speedily reconciled to cricket. There is no place like Hook on Whit Monday and we are pleased to report that none of our cricketers is missing not even those who\ntrusted their lives to Useless and John Rambaut on an incredibly traffic ridden London road.

Three weeks.ago, in the first Private Member's debate for12 years, Mr. M. Phillips Price moved a motion urging the\nfullest development of Britain' s scientific resources and\nmanpower. Some fifteen M.P.s spoke during the four hour debate\nwhich was packed with Interesting and (mostly) well informed comment. One of the recurring themes was the question of\ntechnological education and a number of speakers referred to Imperial College in the course of their remarks.\nMr. M.P. Price whilst acknowledging I.C. at South Kensington said we had nothing in England to compare with M.I.T. or the\nTech is che Hochschule at Char lott on burg. He wanted to separate the technical colleges and their degrees from the universities on the grounds that the universities' scientific work was\nmore theoretical. Mr, Alb u( a graduate of I.C.) pointed out\nthat I.C. was something more than a technical college it also taught pure science and was in fact a college of the\nUniversity of London, awarding degrees, Mr, Rankine pointed out that such a separation would, res a. lt In reversing the\nprocess of elevating the status of the technical colleges and\nwould be fatal to the development of the very research Mr. Price wished to see progressing,( It would appear, however, that Mr. Price was referring to technical education at a somewhat\nlower level). Mr. Price made references to the 1851 Exhibition and suggested that perhaps the 1951 Exhibition was a great opportunity for further development in technical education. Mr. W. Wells, urging higher salaries for teachers at university level and referring to the shortage of technological manpower\nsaid he found \"some trepidation in speaking when graduates\nof the Imperial College of Science are In front of me.\" Mr.\nWells expressed suspicion \"of the idea of putting together a great many technologists broadly following the same kind of\ncareer and study and calling them a university, I was inclined to argue? 'That is not really a university at all. A university is a place where we find mixed together students of the classics, history, theology, engineering, chemistry and other branches\nof learning,'\" He went on to s. ay that sufficient diversity might be introduced Into a technological institution to ensure\nthat the condition of university life is satisfied.
