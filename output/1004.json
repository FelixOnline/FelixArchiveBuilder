    "content": "10 Opinion / Puzzle Page\nCollege Maintenance's Open Door Policy\nDear Bee,\nIf there's one thing that you would assume\nevery student in hall is entitled to it's the\nknowledge that for one year at least your room\nis somehow yours. When you lock the door it\nstays locked and you are safe in the knowledge\nthat no-one else can get their hands on your well\ncollected stuff.\nThe vital exception to this of course is\nmaintenance staff who have the right to enter a student's room in hall to do the sort of fun\nexciting stuff that maintenance staff do: like\ngiving you a new carpet or even a new bed (!).\nHowever you would at least expect them not\nto leave your room open - that would be like\nfetching your jumper from a friend's car, only\nto leave it unlocked (the car, not the jumper)\nwhen you return to the pub .\nAs you can imagine, I was not impressed\nwhen 1 returned to my room tonight (Tuesday)\nto find it unlocked. I knew I was due to get a new bed (I had been given a letter saying one\nwould be delivered the day before) and as it had\narrived when I got back 1 can only assume that\nit must have been the trusty maintenance men\nthat had left my door unlocked.\nTo add to my concern, they had left my room\nin a tip (well even more of a tip than usual), not\nthe sort of situation to come back to after a hard\nday of work.\nThe letter 1 received had promised that there\nwould be no inconvenience, which I had\nstupidly assumed meant for me. Well as long as\nthe maintenance men were not too\ninconvenienced then I guess it's alright.\nIf this was just an isolated incident then I may have found it in my heart to forgive such\ngross negligence, but no! A few months ago I, along with others in hall, was promised a new\ncarpet. Great, at last! (or so I thought). The\ncarpet itself was fitted fine, but as with this\nlatest incident I was somewhat surprised to\nreturn to my room one lunchtime to discover\nthat not only was my door wide open and all of\nmy furniture was out on the landing, but there\nwas no-one about to be responsible for it. But at\nleast I wasn't alone - the other three rooms on\nthe landing were in a similar state.\nFor both incidents I was promised that the\nwork would be supervised at all times, and it\nprobably was at the time, but that's really of\nlittle help when either my furniture is left out\nfor all to steal, or worse it's left in my room\nwith the door unlocked for all to steal - it was a nightmare! For the carpet fitting I'd even been\nasked to clear all of my stuff off of the floor,\ndesk, bed and table, leaving me as a typical\njunk-hoarding student to pack it all in to boxes,\nmaking it even more convenient for any\npotential would-be thief to lay their greedy mitts\non.\nIn times when we are actively encouraged to\n'lock our rooms at all times' especially to\ndiscourage 'opportunist thieving', I do think\nthat the people in charge should keep a tighter\nreign over the one thing that is out of the\nstudents' control - namely maintenance work,\nafter all it's their responsibility, not ours!\nYours from a locked room somewhere in\nSouthside,\nMiss J Decock & Co.\nSt Mary's Hospital LINKS Group\nWe are the student body of St John's ambulance and provide first aid cover for\nWest End theatres, London venues eg.\nWimbledon and also public events.\nWe will be running a course, 'Communication\nWith The Deaf And Blind' on the first three\nTuesdays in October.

When they kill a bunch of Detroit carjack crs who've recovered a truck containing forged notes, the ensuing\nshootout takes the life of Axel Foley's boss. As\na result, Foley traces the suitably camp\n(heh-heh-heh) bad guys back to Beverly Hills\nwhere he follows them to do that whole\nvengeance thing.\nThe film suffers a little from some rather\nrope y special effects and a rather vacuous (why\nam I not surprised?) love-interest, albeit one\nwhich leads to the best gag in the movie. On the\nplus side there're a couple of quite big\nexplosions and as you'd expect from Landis\nThe return of Eddie Murphy as the cop with attitude\ncameos abound from, among others, director\nBarbet Schroeder, ye olde effects man Ray\nHarryhausen and George Lucas. Although some\nof the sets look a tad cheap and the script is\ndistinctly lightweight, Cop 3 has enough action\nsequences and some rather odd humour while it\nlasts to keep most popcorn-movie fans like me\nhappy.

    "content": "6 Reviews\nAurian\nby Maggie Furey\nI don't read fantasy of the 'sword and sorcery'\ntype very often. That's the first thing. I usually\nget put off by the words 'Book One of...' on\nfront covers. That's the second thing. I picked\nthis book up and finished it (all 600-odd pages)\nin less than three days (less time that it'll take to\nfinish this review!). That's the third thing.\nNot that this is a real heavyweight of a novel\n(despite its size!) - it treads the well-worn path\nof 'quest for mystical artefact with which to\nfight the forces of evil'. The difference between\nthis one and others is the very high quality of its\nnarrative - you have wonderfully developed\ncharacters, (mostly) good dialogue and a beautifully atmospheric backdrop to a well-told\n(if oft-used) tale. What more could you ask for\nfrom recreational reading?\nThe story follows the growth of Aurian,\nfrom impetuous Mage-child to mature young\nMage-woman through love, anger, grief and\nfinally redemption. Although the book centres\non her, the story is told by many characters:\nForral, a swordsman and her Mortal lover; her\ndevoted servant Anvar; Miathan the Arch-Mage\n(and arch-villain) to name but a few.\nMaggie Furey examines all the characters in\ngreat depth and as a result the plot becomes a composition of their lives and personalities\nrather than just a sequence of events involving\npeople with odd names.\nRich and colourful, page-turning ly good\nwriting - this is fantasy as it should be. (I might\neven buy the sequels, when they appear.)\nCatfish\nPublished by: Legend\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nNew Knight of the\nSzymphony\nEven if Sir Simon Rattle (above) cracked open a whole case of Cordon Rouge a fortnight ago, he\ncouldn't have hoped to enjoy a headier\ncelebration of his appearance on the birthday\nhonours list than this new EMI disc.\nThe Polish composer Karol Szymanowski (I think that's 'Shummernoffski', more or less)\ndied in 1937, aged 55. His Third Symphony,\n'The Song of the Night' for tenor, chorus and\norchestra, sets a Polish translation of a text by\nthe 13th century Persian mystical poet Jalal ad-Din ar-Rumi. The music is like a blend of\nScriabin and Debussy; ecstatic, swooning,\nperfumed impressionism. Violin and horn\nmelodies aspire giddily, while strands of\ncounterpoint teeter along the brink of tonality.\nThe playing of the City of Birmingham\nSymphony Orchestra is ravishing and the\nrecording spectacular. No-one who has heard\nwhat Rattle and his band can achieve live will\ndoubt that the EMI engineers have been\nanything less than totally faithful in their\nrendering of the orchestra's dynamic range,\nfrom a wisp of pianissimo violins to tweeter-jiggling climactic tutt is. The main competition comes from Antal\nDorati's early digital version with the Detroit\nSymphony Orchestra on mid-price Decca.\nDorati is grittier, with a more immediate lower\nregister to his recording and a more involving\nsoloist. I found myself wondering momentarily\nif Szymanowski ought to sound as French as\nRattle makes him. But the EMI performance is\nin a different league in terms of tone quality and\npacing. Dorati sounds rushed in the Scherzo;\nRattle starts off slowly, but after an Ali shuffle\nof an acc ele ran do, he and his players float like\nbutterflies.\nThe other main item on the new disc is the\nStabat Mater. Szymanowski's setting of a Polish\nversion of the lament of Christ's mother at the\nfoot of the cross dates from 1926, ten years after\nthe Third Symphony. His style has become\nmore austere, but the music is if anything even\nmore beautiful - try track six. Rattle's first rate\ntrio of soloists steal the show; soprano Elzbieta\nSzmytka in particular is radiantly pure and\nlustful. [/ think you mean 'lustrous' - Ed.]\nIndeed I do, bless your cotton socks.\nPatrick Wood\nMonty Python's Flying Circus\nMonty Python's Flying Circus is unlikely to\nneed any introduction to most readers. Almost\neveryone knows a Pythonite who will at every\nopportunity launch into reciting entire scripts\nwith vehemence worthy of a demonic po session. Such is the totemic influence of the show on\nmodern comedy.\nThe good news is, on the show's25 th Anniversary, you can now get some peace. A new collection of videos with every episode in\nchronological order has been released, almost as\nsure to silence a comedy anorak as nailing their\nlips to a wall.\nTo the uninitiated, the show can seem like a tele visual version of the freemasons. The\nstream-of-con cio us ness flow of the sketches and\nthe furious surrealism of Terry Gilliam's animation bemuse some people and induce\nhysterical laughter in others. The Monty Python\nteam's flippant contempt for any convention\ncreated a comedy show in contradiction of all\nothers.

    "content": "Feature 5\nDennis Saw talks about genetic engineering and its implications on our\nsociety. Will we ever be in a position to engineer the perfect human being\nWhite Mice Can't Jump\nIt's true. And neither can brown ones, nor\nagouti ones. The fact of the matter is, the\ncommon laboratory mouse, Mus musculus, has\nbeen so domesticated that, unlike its ancestors\nor its wild counterpart, it'll never make money\nfrom Nike Air (TM) commercials.\nThe up side is, of course, that it's much\neasier to catch the Speedy Gonzales that can't Kanga out of your grasp each time you corner it\n(or approach it menacingly with a carving\nknife). And all this happened before we'd even\nheard of genetic engineering.\nUnsuspectingly, we as human beings have\nbeen playing with modifying genes since that\nfirst homo sapien decided: 'Bugger it. I'm not\ngoing to spend my time running after my meal.\nI 'll catch a few and have my curry tethered to\nthat olive tree. Heck, and for nan, I 'll grow that\nnew Emmer wheat hybrid that's been lying\naround the front porch.'\nIf we aren't brave\nenough to try, after\ncalculating the risks\ninvolved to our best\nability, MacDonalds\nwould never have\nexisted.\nThe result? Chihuahuas, race-horses (and the\nsilly names that accompany them, eg. Thrice\nLucky Rubber Duckie), bread wheat and mice\nthat can't jump.\nBiologists call something that stands the test\nof natural selection an 'Evolutionary Stable\nStrategy' (ESS). If we were to take the strict\ndefinition of that term, then there are a number\nof rather non-stable creatures that we have\ncreated. Would you ever ride off into yonder\nwild country with your trusty 12-bore shotgun,\never ready for the menace of a killer pack of\npoodles? Bread wheat is an even stranger affair.\nMuch like seedless grapes, they cannot\nperpetuate without the help of man. Not only is\nthe ear difficult to break up, if it does, the grains\nenjoy a brief second or two of flight, jettison the\nchaff (much like jumbo jets jettisoning their\nwings), describe a perfect parabolic arc and fall\nto the ground much like jumbo jets that have\njettisoned their wings would. In evolutionary\nterms, they are ESS's only if human beings are\naround. We have, either advert ent ly or\ninadvertently (industrial mel an is m of moths\nwon't occur in a world populated with hari\nkrishna s). become an inextricable part of the\nnatural histories of many species of organisms.\nSo, why is the thought of genetically\nengineered organisms so abhorrent? We cull\nbulls to select ones that will result in bigger,\nbetter cow udders. The Victorians have been\nresponsible for altering the face of many a dog\nand petunia. Indeed, it was because of their\npredilection for little furry rodents that the\nmodern lab mice can't do the steeple chase.\nPerhaps it is because genetic manipulators\nyield enormous power. So much power, in fact,\nthat they are akin to a child with the knowledge\nof fusion. He/She can create limitless energy for\nthe world but also limitless destruction. A technological Sword of Damocles. But isn't that\na property of all new-born technology?\nGenetic engineering has suffered more from\nthe wild imagining s of science fiction authors\nthan, say, virtual reality (bar Ben Bova!). I contend that poets, artists and authors are the\nvoices of our collective social conscience. If this\nis true then we are indeed worried that some\nsuper bug might be released into the biosphere\n(or a super-rabbit into Australia); and we are\nworried that someone may one day try to\ngenetically engineer the perfect human being,\nmuch like what Hitler attempted with his now\noutmoded technique of culling. Our social\nconscience is shaped by our history and those\nwho are ignorant of our sometimes painful past\nare condemned to repeat it.\nHowever, we are poised in a unique\nsituation. In the past, much of society was left in\nthe dark when technologists went about\nfervently knitting their sweaters of Utopia, only\nto discover much later that there are no holes for\nthe head or arms but one for the belly-button.\nThe technology of recombinant DNA is unique\nbecause:\na) it is freshly emergent and the public can be\ninformed from the start;\nb) we also wield the disse minatory power of\ntoday's mass media; and\nc) the public is genuinely aware and concerned\nHumankind at large\ncannot be ignorant of\nthe potential side-effects of such research\nand clinical trials\nof the potential of new genetics.\nIf genetic engineers are those sweater-knitters,\nthen the public is in a position to check that the\nright holes are being woven in the right places.\nBut this will happen only if scientists keep the\npublic informed of the state of play. Similarly,\nthe public has to understand that much of\nscience is intelligent, informed and intuitive\ntrial and error. I stress the latter. Remember that\nold maxim of learning from your mistakes? If\nwe aren't brave enough to try, after calculating\nthe risks involved to our best ability,\nThe common laboratory\nmouse, Mus musculus,\nhas now been so\ndomesticated that it'll\nnever make money\nfrom Nike Air TM\ncommercials.\nMacDonalds would never have existed.\nLet's face it: we have been blessed with a tool that can do wonders; that has the potential\nto cure cancer, to relieve babies from the\ndevastation of Tay-Sach's disease. Whilst\nworking towards such goals, we will most\ncertainly generate information that could result\nin the genetic ostracism of sectors of society. As\nsmokers have to pay the price of higher\ninsurance premiums, will individuals\npredisposed to heart disease (that we can detect\nwith a simple genetic test) have to contend with\nthe same? Think of the problems we would\ngenerate if we discovered the nerd gene!\nSaint Thomas Aquinas once quipped: 'We\ncan will something only if we have already\nrecognised it to be good.' [Actually in the\nmodern context it should read as: 'We can will\nsomething only if we have already recognised it\nas giving us an advantage.'] I do not doubt that\ngene therapy and the like will be a major feature\nof future medicine. We can see its advantages,\nbut we cannot ignore the more tricky\nsociological effects in the short term and the\nevolutionary effects in the long term.\nAs a scientist, I am sometimes appalled at\nthe likes of Jeremy Rifkin. However, his job is\nimportant not for repeatedly painting doomsday\nscenarios and inciting wheelchair ed demonstrations, but in reminding us that the\nnew genetics cannot be performed in polished,\nsterile labs in ivory towers isolated from\nhumankind at large. Similarly, humankind at\nlarge cannot be ignorant of the potential side-effects of such research and clinical trials.\nPerhaps one day we'll be able to put that\nspring back into Mus musculus; but the\nquestions of whether mice that can't jump are\ngenetically diseased is one that has to be asked\nand answered by all of human- and rodent-kind.\nAcknowledgements: I'd like to thank Dr Peter\nLittle for inciting discussion and a riot of ideas.\nSee page 9 for a review of Beverly Hills Cop 3\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies\nArty Summer Bridge Victory TWE Go Off\nTo Edinburgh\nThis summer will see a number of IC students\nfrom all over the country converging on\nScotland, or more specifically Edinburgh. The\nreason? Well, Theatre West End will be\nbuilding a theatre during the Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival. We'll then be hosting our own, as well\nas other theatre companies', productions.\nDo you fancy seeing the biggest festival in\nEurope? Can you afford a small amount of\nmoney for (sub sidi sed) accommodation? Are\nyou willing to work for a couple of hours a day\nin the TWE box office or guiding people to their\nseats in the theatre?\nIt doesn't matter if you don't act, direct or\nsing, in fact, if you don't even know your arse\nfrom your elbow when it comes to all things\nthespian and helping TWE at the Edinburgh\nFringe Festival. If you are interested, then ring\nPhillip on 081 675 0817 for more information.\nAnd remember, the licensing hours for the\npubs in Edinburgh go on long into the wee small\nhours of the morning...\nNow that the academic year is over, many of\nyou will want that much needed break, while\nsome of you will still be working, be it in\nUROP, MSc, PhD, jobs or whatever. In either\ncase, you might feel like taking up art - from\nscratch or as a once-forgotten hobby.\nTo encourage you, IC Union's Leonardo\n(Fine Arts) Society will be holding art\nworkshops, taught by Royal College of Art\nstudents over the summer holidays. The classes\nover the past two terms have been a great\nsuccess. The exercises that we have done not\nonly helped our technique but also released\ncreativity (the best so far have been 'energy\nrelease' exercises where we wildly draw and\npaint over a massive sheet of paper - the size of\ntwo tables!). You might have seen some of our\nmembers' work in our recent exhibition.\nThe classes over the summer should only\ncost about \u00a32 per session. They will probably be\non Monday evenings from 6pm to 8pm in Civ\nEng Room 101. If you are interested, leave a note for us in the Union Office pigeonholes\nbefore the end of term. Get cracking, get arty.\nYou don't have to be experienced in art, only\ninterested in experiencing art.\nThursday 16th June saw the long awaited clash\nbetween IC and ULU. IC produced its full quota\nof eight players. Unfortunately ULU could only\noffer four players through ill health.\nConsequently, two IC Bridge Club players\ndefected to the other side, resulting in A Stallone and M Schaffer playing for ULU. This\nwas a fitting penalty for them as Stallone\nwangled his way into the IC Bridge Club\ndespite not being an IC student and Schaffer\nhaving forgotten to wear his sweatshirt.\nThe rivalry between ULU and IC brought\nout the best in our players, notably J Todd and\nD Goodwin who bid a difficult six club slam,\nproducing a swing in IC's favour. The overall\nscore reflected IC's domination of the match: IC\n108, ULU 42. The teams were:\nIC ULU\nD Goodwin S Greaves\nJ Todd G Deakin\nA Joyner\nM Bradley\nR Cannings\nC Purvis\nM Abramson\nJ Schryber\nM Schaffer\nA Stallone\n10th International Medical Sciences Student\nCongress in Istanbul\nHaving spent almost six months of the past\nthree years travelling abroad, the opportunity of\nspending a week in sunny Turkey (perhaps\nun ideally three weeks before exams) was not\ngoing to be passed up. Seven St Mary's students\nconverged on Heathrow on Tuesday 3rd May\neager to present the results of their BSc project\nwork at their first international conference.\nWe arrived in Istanbul, the only city in the\nworld to be built on two continents, to be met\nby students of the Istanbul university faculty of\nmedicine. A short drive to Detam and the\nconference headquarters followed, where we\nregistered and had our first opportunity to meet\nthe 150 delegates from all over the world.\nIn the evening, we made our way to our hotel\nin Beyogluh. We spent the rest of the night\nsampling the culinary delights of the local\nrestaurants.\nIn order to allow the 200 or so people\ninvolved in the conference to get to know each\nother, Wednesday morning was spent visiting\nthe Topkapi palace - seat of the Ottoman\nsultans. A superb three-course lunch followed in\nthe palace restaurant.\nThe afternoon was spent on a Bosphorus\nsteamer going up the straits separating Europe\nand Asia lined with millionaires' villas, palaces\nand forts. We continued to the Black Sea before\nreturning. The evening was spent attending a lively concert by the student band 'Cool White\nCoats' and a cocktail party. We were then\nshown around the Taksim square area by three\nlocal medics until the early hours.\nRefraining from hurling verbal abuse down\nthe phone, we were woken at 7am by an alarm\ncall provided by 'Mucko', one of the Turkish\nmedics. Thursday morning was spent at the\nopening ceremony, with welcome addresses by\nthe Dean, Head of the Scientific Research Club\nand the Mayor of Istanbul. Following a coffee\nbreak, there was a discussion on Andrology.\nThe afternoon provided an opportunity to\nvisit the covered bazaar - a labyrinth of\npassage-ways and 4,000 shops with metal crafts, leather goods, carpets and fake designer labels\nmuch in evidence. We visited the ancient hippodrome and the awe-inspiring Blue Mosque.\nTired and hungry, we returned to our hotel and\nordered the inevitable Pizza Hut take away. Following a leisurely breakfast on Friday\nmorning, Session V of the conference was\nmono polis ed by St Mary's students with\npresentations by H Sheth, C Roberts, R Sarwar\nand L Wiseman. Remaining presentations\nfollowed in sessions VI and VII. Our topics\nincluded 'Endothelin-1 Production by Human\nBreast Cancer Cells' and 'The Effect of the\nMenstrual Cycle on Muscle Function'. All the\ntalks were well received and many prompted a number of detailed questions.\nRelieved that our task was now over, the\nafternoon was spent sunbathing and writing\npostcards. I took the opportunity to be shown\nround the hospital, faculty of medicine and the\nstudent research laboratories - all sited on a single campus. All the delegates were adamant\non not wasting our only Friday night in Istanbul.\nThe St Mary's delegates joined forces with\ngroups from Japan and America and individuals\nfrom Germany, Turkey and Bulgaria. The\nevening was spent amongst the bars and clubs\non the shores of the Bosphorus. This gave us\ntime to relax, recall the past week and meet\nsome locals before retiring to a roof-top bar.\nSaturday saw 20 presentations on offer to\nthose who could make it out of bed to catch the\n8am coach to Detam. We opted for a lie in and\nlast minute sightseeing, arriving in time for the\nclosing ceremony of the conference. Everyone\nthen proceeded to a farewell party, the last\nchance to strengthen new friendships, exchange\naddresses and eat authentic kebabs. The atmosphere was undoubtedly jovial, with a 'drink as\nmuch as you can for free!' policy at the bar.\nTo travellers, Istanbul comes highly\nrecommended - a magnificent city with fascinating buildings, enchanting scenery, endless\nshopping possibilities and always vividly alive.\nTo other medics out there, this international\ncongress which has been running for a decade\nnow, also comes highly recommended. The\nopportunity to exchange views and ideas with\nlike-minded students from all over the world in\na friendly and stimulating atmosphere should\nnot be passed up.\nThere was a genuine aura of friendship in\nevidence, throughout our whole week in\nIstanbul and, indeed, many speakers emphasised\nto the delegates, who had travelled from over 30\ncountries, that science crosses all boundaries of\nreligion, race and culture and is an important\ncontributor to good world relations.\nHiten Sheth, 3rd Year Medical Student\nAn open air performance of Hamlet in Regent's Park - see page 7\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 7\nHamlet\nThe New Shakespeare Company presents three\nplays this summer: Hamlet, A Midsummer\nNight's Dream and The Card. These three plays\nare being shown at the Open Air Theatre in\nRegent's Park. If it is a beautiful day with a clear blue sky which leads to a summer night\nwhere the starry heavens are revealed, then I believe the night is well accompanied by a Shakespearean play. However, having an open\ntheatre near a popular park is always dangerous,\nespecially if the actors have to shout to be\naudible. But the company comes up with a neat\ntrick by using the metal concave set to reflect\ntheir voices into the audience. And a very fitting\nset it is too, where the apparitions which Hamlet\nsees and the scenes where Hamlet is missing is\nwell integrated with it.\nThe play is a shortened version; there is a jump in the script where the confrontation of\nOphelia and Hamlet is cut out for example, so\nthe play can be confusing in some parts.\nFor those not familiar with Shakespearean\ntexts, the following is the outline of the plot! A king dies and his queen marries his brother and\nin the meantime the son, Hamlet, is in the\nmiddle of this and cannot understand the\nii li: The Egg\nOr The\nScorpion\nDespite the small cast in this production, each\nrole is essential and professionally portrayed.\nInitially, the play progresses slowly, but it picks\nup and becomes a rather emotional and intense\nexperience. I felt that I gradually became as\nabsorbed as the cast in many parts of the play.\nIt is an effective play and has a modern\ntheme. \"How civilised are we after 2,000 years\nof civilisation?\" - this is the question that we\nhave to find an answer to during the play. The\ntopic arises from conflicts caused by different\nideas and reasoning between each character.\nA very successful woman, Joan (Anna\nKirke), is on her way to a very important dinner\nat the peak of her career. She and her father,\nPeter (Bill Bingham), arc confronted suddenly\nby Julie and Ned (Justine Glenton and Michael\nBrophy) whose appeals and demands lay a path\nto the past for Joan and her father to explain.\nThe part Julie played by Justine Glenton is\nparticularly convincing. The make-up and\ncostumes are subtle and the play is excellent\n1!\nM What is wrong my friend? (Hamlet is played by Damian Lewis)\nsuddenness of all that has happened. From his\nghost-father he learns that treachery is involved.\nFrom this background the story is unfolded.\nThis is definitely a play not to be missed.\nHowever, I believe this particular production\ncouldn't carry a lot of the weight which the play\nrequires. Bright fading lights, beautiful intricate\ncostumes and such a large set with loud sound\neffects give the grounding for my feeling that\nthe director placed more emphasis on modern\nentertainment value than on the exploration of\nthe play. It seemed to run in such a manner that\nso long as you just let the atmosphere soak in\nand didn't concentrate too much, this\nproduction could be entertaining. I don't think\nthis play is for the Shakespearean play critics; it\nwasn't too bad, but could have been a lot better.\nJack\nOpen Air Theatre, Regent's Park. Tube: Baker\nStreet. 071 486 2431/1933. Tickets: \u00a37-\u00a316.50.\nSeason ends on 10th September.\nJoan (Anna Kirke) catches up with her past life when she meets Julie played by Justine Glenton\noverall.
