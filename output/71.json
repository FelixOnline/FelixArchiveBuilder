    "content": "2 FELIX\nPROFILE PEGGY TAYLOR Producing a profile of Miss Peggy Taylor,\nthis year's President of I. C.W. A., libellous\nenough for Felix, has proved difficult. No amount\nof excavation could uncover a sordid past, no\nundeclared, hush and s, no well-drained bottles -in fact, no Private Life.\nBorn young in Hammersmith, she looked round,\ntook fright and fled to school in Bedford. An\nearly interest in the structure of things took her\ninto a chemical laboratory; and, although she has\nworked in several of these, at Seals Hayne Agricult ural College, and also for the Ministry of Agriculture at Starcross in Devon, she has never\nmanaged to escape entirely, and is now half-way\nthrough her third year in the Chemistry Department.\nA believer in variety being the spice of\nholidays, she has canned fruit for fourteen hours\na day in Sweden, lived under canvas in the middle\nof Paris, and nursed a sick fellow-traveller in a truck on its dusty way through Yugoslavia.\nAs regards her nursing activities, when two\nor three of I. C.W. A. decided to retire from the\nstrain of lectures for a few days under the codeword \"1\nflu\", they were bullied and coaxed back\ninto perfect health by Peggy, in no time at all. The dramatic society find her an efficient\nRoman hairdresser and she capably supervises the\ndressing of their plays. When not under the\nstress of imminent examinations she supports\n\"hops\", and Arosa meetings. A well-trained\nIcwarian she plays table-tennis and squash.\nTennis she plays for pleasure.\nWhenever I.C. W.A.is Involved in College\nactivities, Peggy is there, quietly enthusiastic\nand playing an unobtrusive part. When asked, she\nis always ready to give help and advice, and (an\ninfuriating characteristic this) she is always\nright. You may think from all this that she is r paragon, but she is inclined to lose umbrellas.\nShe is interested in Gilbert and Sullivan,\ncollecting old silver, and buying new umbrellas.\nThe only thin* we know which rouses her to anger\nis an ill-mannered man.\nFILM REVIEW following the excellent Television adaption\nof his book 1984, the name of George Orwell has\nbecome one f axl liar to many, and booksellers have\nreported large sales of his two best known works\n\"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\".\nThe latter has now been made into a film and\ni a currently showing in the West End.\nBriefly the story is of a badly managed farm\nwhich is taken over by the animals on it, who lay\ndown rules for its regulation. The animals are\nled at first by a kindly leader Snowball who is however soon removed as a \"traitor\" by \"Pig Brother\"\nNapoleon. The film deals with Napoleon's tyrannous rule and disregard j f the laws of the farm,\nin ol u ding his famous amendment \" All animals are\nequal, but some are more equal than others1\" The producer has tried a daring experiment by\nmaking a novel with a political basis into what\nmay be termed a \"cartoon\".\nThe-artists have done a very fine job and\nhave put over Napoleon's tyranny extremely well;\nhe has been endowed with a personality of his own.\nThe actual colouring of the scenes, the drawing and the sound tra ok are all skillfully oom bin ed together to express the story and are seldom wrong-ly used. A so ene with great effect is the ani-mals' revolt against Napoleon when one feels their\ninsurgent anger. This is a bold experiment well\nworth seeing.\nTHE WHITE SHEEP OF THE FAMILY AT Q.E. C In choosing a fairly recently expired West End\nsuccess, I.C. Dramatic Society no doubt hoped that\nits reputation would ensure a good reception.\nHowever, judging by the rather sparse attendance\nit appears that the grapevine must have been blurting that this was not another Pheonix Too Frequent\nor more likely, staging the play at one of I.C. happy hunting grounds kept away those who did not\nwish to mix business with pleasure.\nIf the criterion of this production were to be\nbased on the response of the audience to the humour\nit contained, it would have been adjudged flawless,\nbut the excellence of the humour was offset by\nsome of the straight dialogue being at rifle life less. Ian Duff, as James Winter, by day a respected citizen, by night a reputed safe cracker, gave\nan uninspired performance for the first act, but\nimproved considerably afterwards and acted well in\nthe last act. Sheila Taylor was never very convincing as Winter's motherly, shoplifting wife.\nIn all fairness it should be emphasized that it is\nvery difficult for undergraduates to impress in\nsemi Darby and Joan portrayals (especially when the\nmake-up department does not appear to be on their\nside.)\nNevertheless, the first act was a little static until the vicar blustered on to the stage -Leslie Allen's hilarious character is ation of a venerable absent minded vicar enlivened proceedings\nfrom thence onwards. He conveyed the impression\nof age excellently with his doddering movement and\nspeech, and his inclined posture - although it was\nfelt that he straightened up at rifle more than\nhis lumbago would normally allow. Derek Hill's version of Sam Jackson, asp iv type who was\nMr. Winter's \"fence\", was also well done.\nThe rest of the cast, with the exception of\nthe producer, Martin Jacob, who twice flitted on\nto the stage as Asst. Comm. Preston, were not\nencumbered by their youth. Peter Winter - the\nwhite sheep - (or the shepherd who tried to lose\nhis crook) was adequately acted by Dan Boyle.\nAs his sister Pat, a female Artful Dodger, Judith\nKornbluth was very impressive. Janet, the app re tlc e pickpocket-c urn housemaid. and Angela Preston\n(who fortunately was no angel) were commend aol y performed by Barbara Russell and Rosemary Melvill'\n\"Herbert\", the Imperial College phoenix, is back in the Union office after his health trip to\nNorthampton. The carrots which for some reason\nseem to be so dear to the Northampton heart are\nback where they belong.\nTaking an objective look at \"Herbert\" one .\ncould see that his colour scheme was more vivid\nthan formerly. Without partisan bias it is fair to say that we painted the carrot in a more\nartistic fashion.\nTHE RECTOR Imperial College nn i0n welcomes Professor\nR.P. Linstead F..H.. S. who officially became Rector\nof Imperial college on January 1st, this year.\nPrevious to this a pn ointment Professor Linstead\nheld the Chair of C^an ie chemistry in the H. c.S.I tie expected that he will retain an interest\"\nin the progress of research in that department.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\ni. cccc SHEFFIELD UN IV. STORM TO VICTORY THROUGH THE SNOW The Arotio conditions which spread havoc amongst\nthe weekend sports programmes,did not prevent the jI. C. Cross Country Club from holding their annual oro sac out t tu y mato h w l th Sheffield University at Sheffield.\nThe inclusion of teams from Loughborough College\nand Nottingham University added extra importance\nand interest to the match.\nIt had been snowing heavily sino e eight o'c look on Saturday morning,and this coming on the top\nof a frozen hard surface promised to make the\ncourse very treacherous.\nA fine snow was driving into the faces of the\ncompetitors as they lined up for the start,and\ntra ok suits were reluctantly removed,At the word\n\"Go\" forty runners surged forward throng* the\nfifteen l no he s of snow,almost trampling the press\nphotographer underfoot aa he disappeared in a flurry of snow.\nThere was some confusion at the start as to\nwhich direction the o our se should go,but T. Bailey\n(I.C.) and A. J. BROWN(Notts.) soon took the lead\nand quickly forged ahead.A thin mist creeping in from the moors blotted out all landmarks,causing\nBailey and Brown to go off course,so losing the\n2nd and Ist places which they would inevitably;\nhave gained.\nMeanwhile the rest of the field were slipping\nand sliding over snow covered,frost-bound ploughed\nfields,through streams and over stiles, Hailes of Sheffield won the rao e with a time of\n29m3s, leading a strong Sheffield team to a surprising yet well earned v le tory, Loughborough were 2nd and I.C.3 rd. Belley{7th). Meller(IIth),01d field( I4)\nDearden(I8th),k orr is(20 th), and Turner(25th) were\nthe soo ring members of I.C.'s team.\nHad the I.C. team excelled itself with the same\ndistinction it displayed in the Sheffield Union\nlater in the evening,a different result might\nhare arisen.\nSOCCER I.C CUP CHANCE\nHOCKEY\nLast term provided the most miserable\nsequence of playing conditions for at least seven\nyears. Only one match was played on anything\nlike a firm surface, all others being played either\nin pouring rain or on a mud-patch; of the 15\nmatches scheduled to be played by the first eleven,\nfive had to be cancelled due to unfit pitches.\nThe results show that the Club has not really held its own as yet against its stronger o lub opponents and this is most disappointing as the\nteam is potentially the strongest sino e we last won the U.L. Cup. There is no doubt that the\nforwards are the major offenders as, with the\nexo ep tion of one match; they have seldom looked\nlike soo ring. Anything less like \"boyish enthusiasm* In their play is hard to imagine and they\nmust surely app reo i ate by now that mature consideration has never won any game\u2014\u2014 let alone scored\ngoals. In desperation and against advice, the\nCaptain has moved himself from left bao k to\no entre forward and he thinks that some improvement has resulted. As has always been the case\nIn I.C. Hookey the def eno e has functioned well and\nIn particular, Peter Mantle at right bao k has been\nconsistently brilliant showing how hookey should\nbe played in the Classical style.\nAs usual, the 2nd eleven contend that they\nare hardly weaker than the 1st eleven but with ao\nstrong a forward line their results have been\nrather disappointing.\nColin Spenoe has had a varied and varying\nassortment of players In the 3rd eleven and the\n\u2022Xtent of the differing strengths from week to\n\u2022pic o an be judged from the fao t that the results\nin o lude a91 defeat and a93 victory.\nOne o an only hope that more clement weather\nand results will oom e our way this term.\nOn Bee.Ilth the Ist XI reached the semi-final\n)f the U.L. Cup competition by defeating Westminster\nt0 at Harlington. The supporters of both teams\nwitnessed a very closely contested battle with the\nhonours just going to the home team.\nFor the first fifteen minutes the home team\nattacked incessantly but somehow the Westminster jos l remained intact .By this time the visitors ware paying more as a team but their sporadic rata? an the\nI.C. goal never really spelled danger,due to some\nsound if not spectacular play by t!? home d? fei v:s It was not until the near the end however tft if g the vital goal came.This was a fine effort e;n\"s5 Hodge,who having moved in from the wing beat all\nopposition and placed the bal] in the corner- y ft fet f net,leaving the goalkeeper well beaten.In n5. tr ftp.fl<\u00bb\nness the end came with I.C. still attacking Hird.\nTeam;- M. McLeman,J. Anderson,R. Dytham.DSMoors,\nK. Richards,P. Blackall.P. May,A. Holgate,G. Green(c* nt}\nC. Brindley,K. Hodge.\nThe semi-final of the U.L. Cup will be I.C.y Goldsmiths\non Sat. 29th January.(probably at Berrylands,L.S.e,' s ground.) Supporters will be most welcome and a coach\nwill be leaving from the Union.\nRUG GER Last Friday's \"Evening Standard\" contained the\nfollowing information:\nRUGBY OFF TOMORROW\nWales v. England.\nStaines v. Imperial College ( all mato he s) This is the second time that we have been ment i one d in the press this season, as our defeat\nin the University Cup was considered, quite\nrightly, to be sensational enough for in ol usi on in the results listed in THE TIMES.\nThe first XV has been hit hard by injuries,\nand with several men playing for University teams,\nhas been slightly below the o us to mary very high\nstandard. Nevertheless they have fully justified\ntheir strong fixture list, and the worst defeat,\n12 - 3 by London Welsh 'A', was certainly no\ndisgrace for a college team. As usual, we have\nshown a general superiority over other colleges,\nbut our only defeat by one,came,unfortunately, in\nthe Cup Hatch. This was played in appalling cond-it ions, and also we were for oed to play four re--serves. University College, knowing they '/ere up\nagainst the Cup-holders of three successive years,\nhad everything to gain and nothing to lose, \"hey\nfought like tigers and thoroughly deserved their\n5 - 3 win. This result should certainly add -pice\nto next years competition 1 It is worth noting that\nI.C.'s heaviest defeat In a Cup Match over a period\nof six years is30 by Tets in1930. During this\ntine we have scored 140 points to our opponents'\n47 in the competition.\nThis term there are many tough matches Including\na tour of Cornwall. Incidentally there is also a \u2022friendly l\" with U.C., which should be a good blood\nbath.\nThe 2nd XV, more than a match for most college 1st teams, has inevitably been weakened by the injuries\nin the 1st team, nevertheless it nas given a goon\naccount of Itself and has won six of its nine games.\nThe spirit and performance of the three lower teams\nare well In accordance with tradition. Dan Fowler\n(Ex a) must surely be the only' Rugby captain who has\nbeen known to respond to his fly half's shouts for\nthe ball by standing bolt upright in the middle of\na loose scrum and shouting \" If you want the _ _ _ _ _ thing, o oae and get it yourself1\" The spirit of his\nteam was consolidated by a fine win during an all day (and nearly all night) visit to Crawley, Sussex.\nNo doubt the climax of its \u2022aka eve ment s will come\nafter the Rugger Club Dinner, so look out Frank.\nFor swum NC report please see page 4.\nPublished by 'he FELIX Board.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nMOUNTAINEERING WEEK.1 a week and a half just after Christmas\nI.C. Mountaineering Club visited a climbing hut\nin a remote Lakeland valley reached most quickly\nby foot by way of mountain passes. The hut was\nconveniently situated for rock climbing on Sea\nPell, but if Great Gable or Pillar Rock were\nvisited \"the return lay by way of the Wastwater\nHotel: most of the climbing was done on Great\nGable, this being the nearer of the two latter peaks.\nThe weather was extremely cold, but mainly\ndry, and there was only a slight sprinkling of\nsnow on the peaks. The wind was very strong,\nsometimes making even walking on the high ridge\nalmost impossible. The Gable cliffs were\nsufficiently sheltered for quite a large number\nof climbs to be done there, the highlights being\nascents of Kern Knotts Crack, an intimidating\ncrack on a vertical wall, too narrow to get\ninside until one is about 40 feet up, ( it is a great relief to get inside the crack as It Is too tight to fall out of), and Lucifer Craok\nwhich proved to be rather exposed to wind, and\nin Its100 feet was never more than a few inches\nwide. Napes Needle was climbed several times.\nPhotographs of this seem to show people hanging\non to an almost bottomless vertical fao e with\nhardly any holds. In fact, the usual route is quite a safe crack with plenty of foot and hand\nholds, leading to a very big ledge (the shoulder)\nafter only about 40 feet of o limb ing.A delicate\nmove then follows, and an airy face (with plenty\nof holds) brings you to the top of the climb after\nanother 15 feet. There are harder and longer\nroutes to the top, it being usual for climbers\nnot to be satisfied with the easiest way. Members of the party climbed one of these routes -the Obverse route, and also traversed right\nround the needle at the level of the shoulder.\nA large number of easier and longer climbs\nwere done, and nearly all the surrounding peaks\nwere visited. Most of the climbs around j Wasdalt\nare at a high level( about 2500 feet) but on one\nof the most cold and windy days the party visited a low cliff just above Wastwater, where for on oe we could climb without numb fingers. Its shel-te redness was the more appreciated when after the\nclimbing was done we walked to the top of the hill, Yew barrow, on the flank of which we had been\no limb ing, where pools were covered with ice three\nin o he s thick, and a shrivelling blast was blowing.\nThe ridge fortunately led towards the Wastwater\nHotel, and the promise of its comfort spurred us\non.\nOn the last day a midnight ascent was made\nof one of the nearest hills, called The Screes.\nThe moon was nearly full, though its light was\nrather deceptive - things looked ten times further\naway than they proved to be. The cold wind made\nthe tripa little less romantic than it sounds.\nDID YOU know that almost 250 books have disappeared from the Union Library during the last\nthree years?\nMISSION.

In the individual events the winners\nwere. Clark (3 events), Hoy and Spokes for RCS;\nHemingway for Guilds and Lampard (2 event a) for\nthe Mines. Guilds took five second places.

    "content": "3\nEVERY FORTNIGHT No. 71\nTHE STATE OF THE UNION Lacking a front page headline and story, for\nit seems that absolutely nothing has happened\nduring the Vae., and the term is too young for\nma,1or occurrences. we thought it was time that\nsomebody enquired into the progress made in the\nbuilding operations on the Union Building.\n*e found that, in the official wording, \"due\nto a lack of dressed stone'! there has not been as\nmuch progress as was hoped. This has necessitated\nabandoning, the programme originally scheduled for\nBaster. The intention now is to fit a temporary\nroof at the first floor level over the space that\nwas the Old lounge, so that this can be used as a refectory. The original hope was that this side\nof the building would be complete up to the top\nof the first floor level by Baster.\nWhen the temporary catering arrangements are\ncomplete, demolition work will start on the other\nhalf of the building, and the Union will lose the\nuse of the Upper and Lower Dining Halls. Naturall y, this will involve cons Mw able shortage of\ndining facilities, and the Planning Dept. is at\nthe present time concentrating on the new catering\narrangements. With better organisation and distribution of food, Ayrton Hall can cope with many\nmore people at lunch-times, and most probably\nthis will become the central eating-pl t. ce.\nLoss of eating-space is not the only additional discomfort to be faced after Easter. There\n?ill be two fewer rooms available for social\nunctions and club activities. It is intended to\nuse the Ayrton Hall more extensively this term.\nThree or four Saturday night \"hops\" are planned\nthere before Baster. The general shortage of\nrooms should be eased about this time as rooms in the Beit Building, at present occupied by Registry staff, become available for Union use.\nI5 CARNIVAL NIGHT MINES NIGHT. Before^de sori bing the events of the night of\nDecember 10 , 1954, we give a word of praise to\nthe Mines' Entertainments Committee and all those\ne ner get io people who made the Carnival possible.\nShe recent disruptions in the Union itself have made the organisation, of all dances a difficult task, butt not insuperable by keen en devour and hard work.The deo orations for the Carnival were,\nof necessity, prefabricated in the R.S. M. and trans\nported to the Union on Thursday- a day before the\nevent- and there erected.\nAll the Dramatic Society stage flats had been\nmislaid, and the Miners had to find a substitute\nfor these in a very snort time. They used paper,\nwhich in the normal course of events, would have\nserved the purpose admirably. In a matter of hours\nthe Snack Bar and the Upper Dining Hall had been\ntransformed into a fairy land Beer Garden, and\nneeded only \"Mein Herr und Fraulein* to complete\nthe illusion. Came the magic hour of nine. Let the rev fil ry commence ll! The carnival followed the course of previous\ncarnivals, with the rapid interchange of partners\nas one after another of the men fell out through\nexhaustion or inebriation.\nOur beloved friend mit moustaches found the\nworld too hard, so he lapsed into the realms of\nunc on cio us ness. The o look struck one, and the Cabaret com men ced. Herr von Kingdon should have known better\nthan to pui x the leg of Guilds. The building\nshook as \"Boomalakas\" roared across the room, a^r) the aoi ig ster a found it impossible to continue for\nfive minutes.\nWe've never seen,\nanything quite like Mein. Herr Buster trip ping the light fanta s tic*, and tripping is the right word; not\nsince Kitch. pirouetted\non the end of a rope\nla the good old days-.\nDancing o on tin sed wall into the morning,\nand the Jazz men in the\nUpper Dining Hall Bank\ndeeper into a Rhythmic\ntra no e and played till past 7.00.\nres, all in all, the Carnival was as ii ft ces s, marred only t jy those moronic gentle,\nmen who considered It- gre ac fun to mutilate the\ndeo orations. If only they had put them up, how loath they\nwould be to tear them down.\n\n"

The thing we have all been dreading has at\nlast happened. There is a Television set in the\nOld Hostel. Is TV a home-breaker or maker, does\nit destroy the ability to entertain one's friends?\nWe will be able to study the effects on Mr. Levine,\nwho says it was a Christmas present.

Do\nyou find yourself talking to yourself(?) in your\nsleep? If so spend an and free yourself at\n\u2022o night's Guilds Carnival. Clubs are obtainable\nthe usual offices i.e.I. e. Bar etc.\nXMAS CONCERT The Christmas Concert of the I.C. Musical Society\nwas held on Dec 8th. in c.A.H. The Jaques String Orchestra, conductor Dr. Eric\nBrown, opened the programme with 'Alcina', by\nHandel, a quiet,lyrical piece, putting everyone\nin a Christmassy mood. I felt that both this and\nthe 'Hymn to ST. Cecilia' which followed, however,\nwere strange choices for a Christmas concert. Brit ten's 'Hymn to ST.Cecilia' is a very difficult work to sing as it is unaccompanied. It would perhaps have been fairer to the choir if they had had\nsomething easier and more melodic to loosen up\ntheir voices. As it was, the soprano tone was harsh\nespecially on the forte notes, and we could not\nhear the words. The soloists were Georgina Carroll,\nsoprano; Helen MoKinnon,contralto; Patrick Halstead,\ntenor; and Bryan Johnson,bass; all of whom sang\nwell, although once again we lost many of Miss Carr oll' s words.\nThe five carols.which followed, were quite a rel i ef. The first,\"Masters in this Hall\" is a del ig ht ful carol, and both choir and audience enjoyed it, but the choir were hampered by the\nacoustics of the hall which makes loud notes\ndeafening. We then Joined in singing 'Good King\nwenceslas', and the choir sang two unaccompanied\ncarols, 'The Truth sent from Above', and a really\ndelightful arrangement of the Czech carol,'Rock-ing' which was beautifully sung. We again Joined\nin with '0 Come, all ye Faithful', in which I missed the descant.\nThe second half began with Elgar's 'Serenade',\nwhich has a truly lovely melody and was very well\nplayed. I can only say of the last item, Mozart's 'Mass inC', that it was excellent, choir and soloists sang well and we were all sorry when it finished.\nIn spite of any Taults, I think that the Musical\nSociety should be congratulated on giving us a most enjoyable evening.\nS. R.G. TOUCHSTONE After a coach ride to Silwood Park, and\na light tea, the XI or 40 students who found\nthe spare time for a cheap and invigorating\nweekend were addressed by Dr. Sole, an author-it y on the subject of extra-sensory perception.\nHe described mainly the work done in America\nand his own work, using statistical methods to\nevaluate the results of thought-transference\ntests, where a subject guessed cards se art only\nby various agents. The lecturer was very\nconvincing even to such an incredulous audience\nas a group of scientists.\nThe lecture was followed by a first class\nsupper, and the meeting then divided into two\ngroups for discussion. Meanwhile a few people\nacted as subjects for some card guessing tests\n- only inconclusive results were obtained.\nThe impression Dr. Sole made on his audience was reflected in the discussion groups,\none group deciding unanimously that the results\nDr. Sole and others obtained is a discovery\nabout human personality, and not evidence that\ntheir statistical methods were incorrect, since\ncontrol experiments showed only chance results.\nThe discussions went on till about 11.30 p.m. after which most people retired to their rather\nhard beds in well heated Nissen huts.\nNothing was arranged for Sunday morning,\nand most people went walking in the pleasant\nsurroundings of Windsor Park. After another\nexcellent meal at lunchtime followed by another\nfree hour, the groups of the previous day met\nto compare notes, and the conclusions they came\nto were commented on by Dr. Sole. Then followed\na light tea before the journey back to Kensington.\nTne Ititertainmfi- ts C<mm ltte e are holding a Charity\nDance in Queenie's oi Saturday January 29th. All proceeds- and we expect a donation worthy of I.C. go to the British Student Tuberculosis Foundation.\nThis student organ is at ioa is associated with\nW.U. S. and like it. depends entirely on voluntary\nsupport.\nYOUR HELP IS NEEDED NEXT SATURDAY.\nAdmission will be 1/- + Tax, so come and bring\nyour friends to the Charity 'Bob Hop'.\nD. R.H. "
