In the London league die y are undefeated afl'~ five games. Tn. their last three\ngames they beat their nearest rivals\nUei u. al' if. M.C.A., who were, until this fixture, also unbeaten. In the London University league?\nI.C. shares the top spot with L.S.E. at whose hands they suffered their\nonly defeat of the season by47 pts56. In the other six games they have played in this league, the Imps have been convincing winners averaging64 pts for and only 4 0 agin st. Under the captaincy of J. Harrison and the scheming of A.

Let's hope the team continue with the same skill and spirit\nindie remaining matches.\nVOLLEYBALL\" IT'S AN ILL WIND\" as they\nsay and one group of people who were saying it was I.C. volleyball team. When they travelled to an awaymatch against London Fire Brigade they thought they were in for a tough match but when they\narrived half the opposition had been called out on duty enabling,\nthem to come home comfortable winners. They won ti he match158 and1513 \u2014 perhaps for the return match they will arrange another\n'convenient* fire.\nWATER-POLO\nLEAGUE\nWITH THE new year comes the new season for the U.L, water polo league and this year all the I.C. teams have got off to a fine start.\nThe first team beat St. Mary's, by an impressive ten goals to three.\nHowever it was the score that wasi m press ive \u2014 not the play. The de^\nfens ive play was poor and only goalie ban yard^ topped the score\nbeing reversed. In spite of this and very scrambled play in front of\ngoal post people seemed to have a turn at scoring with Randall4, Hoo k2,Ong2, Price and Stapley 1.\nThe second team though played to beat St. Mary's seconds 6 - 1 . Nick Spyro u scored from two well taken\nchances and Pete Hills had toe\ngoalie beaten with his lethal back flips. In the centre Chris Collier dominated splitting the St. Mary's de fence by forceful, intelligent play and i was rewarded in the third quarter with a fine goal. The defence with Phil Brown in the net St. Mary's attack except for one did a fine job of blanketing out the'm is ander standing' when they c once ede da consolation goal to the opposition.

By now, if yesterdays meeting went according to\nplan, it has a starting complement of just over a hundred mem-be rs, which will build up as the years go along to three hundred\nor so members at college plus those who have left.\nThe members of the club will meet on every second Thursday in the month with an annual dinner in the summer term. The aims are to\nencourage interest between the sport men of different clubs in each\nother and each others sport, and membership is to be thought of as an award for effort! and interest in I.C. sport, especially for those people who would not gain the more usual honour of full colours.\nCaptains of the A.C.C. clubs and the chairman and secret a iy of A.C.C. will be members ex-officio and it will be their job to nominate new members from their club who will only be eligible after they have been at\ncollege for three or more terms and will pay one subscription for life membership. Each club may nominate10% of its membership per year. Other activities planned for the club under the chairmanship of Dai Howell will include a past v present college members sport day at\nH arlington and increased spectator support for each others matches\nand games.\nWANT A FREE TRIP ?\nHowever, you don't need to be a member of 'Stoats' to go along to\nH arlington this afternoon to support the Rugby Club in their Cup match against L.S.E. This is the quarter-final of the Gut te ridge Cup and will be a close and hard struggle. When a depleted first XV met them earlier this year we lost 3-0 and so our team needs all the support it can get.

ES STE it\nsaid. What? \u2014 The European student seminar on Technological Education, organised joS ntl y by students from Manchester Fac.T/ ech.. Sltrathclyde,\nand I. C.,had begun. Over40 students from technological Universities, in9 European countries ( including Brendon Parker, Das Howell heavily dis-guise d as Chris Mol an, and Adrian Fletcher) gathered for a week's intensive\ndiscussions covering the whole range of education of technologists in Europe \u2014 how various systems compared, and how they could be improved. This week Brendon Parker explores some of the great differences between education in this country and Europe to see what lessons each can le am from the other,\nproblems of I.C. In the next issue, Fletcher looks in detail at the\nTechnical\nEducation\nCompared\nBritish Graduate\nYounger\nT THE whole breadth of techno-* logical education was discussed\nin the various sessions of the\nseminar during the week. The topics\nranged from technological education\nin schools to the possibilities of postgraduate degrees being awarded for\nwork carried out in Industry.\nThe first main difference that\nemerged between the system in Britain and that of most Continental countries was in special is ation. In this country special is ation begins\nmuch earlier in school courses than on the Continent. Allied to this is\nthe fact that in general it takes 5-7\nyears to gain a degree, which is\nconsidered equivalent to the M.Sc, the first two years solely for\ndie \u2022 teaching of basic scientific\nsubjects. This results in Engineers being produced at the age of 2 5 or\nor 26, as opposed to 21 or 22 in this\ncountry, obviously reducing the\namount of scientific manpower available to a country's economy. Because of the shorter time spent\nat University b v British students, it is possible for the majority of them to receive maintain ance Brants. This and the Students* Union facilities\nprovided by the University Grants\nCommittee are much envied by Continental students.\nBritish courses lack freedom\nThe impression gained by toe\ncontinental delegates is that our technological institutes are machines\nfor producing highly specialised technologists in the shortest possible\ntime with s, tate-provided comforts, to\nmake the short intensive passage\nmore pleasant. Our system was much criticised for the lack of academic freedom, regarding choice of lecture\ncourses and our inability to choose\nwhen we should present ourselves\nfor examination.\nStudent representation\nAn important feature of the continental system is that students are\nrepresented at the highest levels of\nthe Boards of Studies - and opinions\nof students are listened to in respect\nto the choice and content of courses.\nA tI.C. there are academic subcommittees which attempt to cater for\nthis necessary student opinion on the\ncontent of courses, but it must be remembered that these committees\nare separate from the bodies which actually govern a student's progress.\nU.K. leads in teaching method\nIt was gratifying to note that W3\nare ahead of the Continent in our application of teaching methods to\ntechnological subjects. Tutorials and supervised class work are almost unknown on the Continent, and there\nis. rarely opportunity to question\nlecturers on difficult points in their lecture material. A great need was felt for the informal contact which exists between staff and students in heir last years at British Universities. Vacation training\nThere was a Surprising difference\nin the attitude of the fore ien delegations to Industry. Most of the continental delegates initially expressed\nthe opinion, that industrial experience\nwas of very limited benefit prior to.\nand during a university technology\ncourse. After some discussion it was\nadmitted that such experience was\nuseful in broadening the outlook of\na student straight from school, but it was still maintained that the\ntechnical knowledge obtained had very little to do with technological\nstudies. It appears that most of the\noutput from technical universities on\nthe Continent is employed in Re search and Development. Language Laboratories\nA feature observable from the excellent English spoken by all t 'te\nforeign delegates, is that it is considered essential for students of\nscience and technology on the continent to have a good knowledge of\nat !e \u00abst one foreign language. Considerable use is made of language\nlaboratories, where a student can learn languages at his leisure. \u2022\nMuch useful information was\ngained at the seminar, many new friendships were made and there has\nbeen an advance in technical and educational co-operation between technology students in Europe. A great deal of credit for the success\nof the seminar must go to Andrew Thompson. ex-president of the\nFaculty of Technology Union in Manchester and the prime mover of\nthe seminar.\nObserver\ncolour delay\nOBSERVER Colour will not be\nfeaturing Universities until the 2 0 th February due to a number of h^M ups.

It is to be hoped that they will bring 'progressives' and Communist dupes\nto reconsider their position on Rhodesia.

While sanctions and other such punitive measures are perhaps going too far, it must be remembered that Mr. Smith and his coMe ague s I(n on of whose personal integrity Has ever been in the slightest\ndoubt in\" anyway whatever) have smirched their previous un blemished records by a grave insult to the majesty of British rule, the sort of action we have come to regard as\nconfined to peoples more backward than ourselves.

Typing - in twelve\neasy lessons\nC HORT LY before Christmas\na letter arrived in the FELIX pigeonhole giving details of a new method of teaching touch\ntyping at a cost only a fraction\nof that of conventional methods.\nThe letter gave the information that for a fee of 9 gn s. as\nit was possible to ler n to touch\ntype (at an average speed of 25\nwords per minute) and for\na further 9 gn s. at a speed of 40\np.m. This apparently revolutionary claim was substantiated by a reprint\nfrom an article which appeared in the the Evening Standard, and explained by a new 'electronic' system of\nteaching. I was sent along by FELIX to take\na course (the elementary) and report\nback on its apparent merits, and duly started lessons on the13 th(!) at the Sight & Sound Education's new premises immediately next to Oxford Underground station.\nThe course consists of twelve one hour lessons, which are given by means t of a tape recorder and large\nkev board of which the keys maybe individually illuminated. The course\nstarts with an in fir odu c tory six minute talk by Jim Parkes (the. Northerner who invented the system) and cont in u es with Mr. Parkes' voice tell ing you exactly what to do, spelling out each letter ...a... now... b now... c... and insisting that you only\nsfl rike the key on the word now, in order that a strict sense of rhythm be instilled from the start.\nAn ability to obey these simple instructions, and the power to resist\nthe temptation to look at the keyboard( of which Mr. Parkes continuously reminds you) are all that are required to complete the course\n(together with free hours on twelve consecutive week days a ttir n xu between9 am and8 pm). I have now completed five hours\nthe course, and progressed to the dizzy heights of using (today) the\nshift key, and the phenomenal rate of\nfifteen words per minute( equivalent,\nbut all lower case), and feel that with the strict sense of rhythm and disc ip line which the course induces I should progress satisfactorily, being\nable to increase my speed by ten a citv after the end o'f the course \u2014 or of\ncourse, if I win the pools, by the expenditure of another 9 gn s.H.E.

Napier, D.Sc of the Royal Free Hospital, gave the second of his brilliant lectures on the Evolution of' Man,' Man in. the Offing'. According to one of the questions asked at the end of' the lecture it.. would, appear Dr Napier confused some of the more ardent Christians in the audience when he said that if you took away Mans1 large brain, his bipedal striding gate and mani pul at at ive hand then you had a nape. These latter to features were in any case, he continued, ex ibi ted to a lesser degree by several of b he higher apes; he then illustr1ated this point with a most enlightening and enjoyable film. On the future of Man Dr. Napier elaborated on his first lecture by saying th a fe the only changes he could see I here; in such factors as height and weight, both of which could be expected to increase, plus the loss of secondary sexual characteristics as women T/ere no longer attracted to a mate by basic masculine features s such as s tren rg thor hairy bodies, and menno longer looked for a women with good childbearing features \u201e This loss, some wit was heard to remark, could be seen in our r own time, giving: Carnaby Street as an example.

    "content": "4 FELIX by the\neditor i It must be nice\nto be revolting\nEvery s tiu dent newspaper goes through periods\nwhen Union executives vie with the editor\nfor control. Last year Pi( UCL), King's News( KCL) and Beaver( LSE) contested for power. More recently, and further from home, Exeter's South Westerner clashed with the University' s Guild Council. Until a fortnight a goI thought that FELIX had made its successful bid for freedom in1963/4. But the Felix Board now demands,\nthat the names of columnists Col cut t and Ignotus be made known to them, and that\nthe number of anonymous writers in the paper be reduced to one.\nYou will appreciate why the Felix Board of Directors wish these anonymous writers\nsilenced when you consider who in fact sits\non the Board. These are the President, Deputy President and Secretaiy of ICU the Pre si dents of the Constituent College Unions, Chairmen of the Athletic Clubs Committee. Be creation al Clubs Committee. Social Clubs Committee and Sil wood Park Committee, the President of I HWA, the Halls Representative on Council \u2014 the very people prone pt tack by Ignotus and Coi cut t \u2014 and the Treasurer and Editor of FELIX. To expose these gentlemen would, in my opinion, prejudice their ability to provide\" an independent comment on Union affairs\" as is\ndeemed necessary in the Constitution of the newspaper. After all, what otherwise anonymous columnist is going to s at i rise or criticise,\nfor example, the President of Guilds, knowing full well that he is running the gun t let of \" having his faced pushed in\"? Recently on radio the Editor of Bristol's None such News asserted that the student news paper be completely free of any Union control on content. It is this freedom from the\" Union line\" on internal politics, at least,\nwhich I feel is responsible for the huge success of FELIX in this academic year.\nSo long as Iam Editor of the paper I shall see\nthat it remains an organ of free speech, that\neditorial policy shall be independent and that Ignotus and Col cut twill remain anonymous until their last offerings. It\nMUST be nice to be revolting.\nAbout this time of year most writers and columnists spend a considerable amount of\ntime and effort recalling the past year which we are all trying our hardest to forget, and some even have the pretentious audacity to\ntake it on themselves\" to make predictions\nabout the year to come. That is just what Iam going to do, and present herewith my forecast of the main news items that appear\nin future Felice s. January: Car towing from Southside carpark begins. Scaffolding added to add aesthetic\nbeauty. Overnight porters for all halls.\nFebruary: Five Union meetings decide to elect\nCollege year reps from Union floor; President\nto be nominated from fresher s; Rector to be elected by constituent Unions; NU St q be allowed to join IC.

Insurance\nDear Sir, Most students at one time or an other are faced with the difficult\nproblem of insurance. The moment ij hey say the word 'student' noone wants to know, particularly in the case of motor insurance. There are\nan alarming number of part time insurance agents working in London trying to sell bad life insurance policies, and this is easily done be cause not many people und fir* the real cost involved and that the agent gets about \u00a3 5 0 for selling the poli cv. As an undergraduate I happened to respond to an advert in Felix by trie Brighton Insurance\nBrokers run by aMr. Gould. Mr. Gould followed up the inquiry by coming to see mein Hall, explaining a lot of useful things about insurance.\nHe isi an ex-student himself and specialises in getting good insurance\nrates for students. He was able to\noffer a much lower motor premium than I was paying already and as a broker could deal with any life\nassurance company, and therefore\noffered a comprehensive insurance\nservice.\nIn two years i of dealings with Mr. Gould I have been very satisfied and would strongly recommend anyone\nwith insurance problems to get in touch with him. His personal service\neven extends to allowing customers\nto call his office on reverse charges,\na most l useful facility.\nI would finally like to point out\nthat I wrote this letter of my own volition and with no financial incentive.

In the Union soles of\nTankard have overhauled Flower's\" Keg( for Ions the best seller) and in the South Side bar, after installation\nof chillers' sales of Guiness( draught,)\nhave increased fourfold since last\nyear, reaching almost a keg a day. The introduction of pies and pin let a and more recently, sandwiches has.\nproved a very sound move, but sales,\nthough high, fluctuate wildly from night tonight( 'one night wem av sell four, dozen the next night sell\nonly four').\nWith th \u00bb review of bar-prices now looming close, it is instructive to\ncompare the situation now with previous years.\nLast year, prices of many beers\nwere lowered by Id, but since then a barmaid has been installed in the Union lounge bar, and a 'part time' barman has been engaged almost continuously. Thus the increase i\" takings does not represent a total\nincrease in profits, but should go along wav towards, meeting the extra\ncosts. Any decision reached by the Winn- C^'m mitt p fl should be examined closely by students.\nH.E. J. Indian Primeminister's son at IC\nGhandi sought by Press\nMR.

The problems arose about 9.30,\nwhen the Celebrating Welsh began to i 'se glasses and bottles to play rugby in the Union Lounge. The duty officers intervened after the\nsituation reached \"absolute chaos...\ngetting very dangerous indeed\", and wi;f ii the help of Presidents of ICU and Constituent colleges quite ned things down, asking the offenders to leave. This they did after attempting\nto turn on the fire hoses on the 1st floor, and throwing bottles into the gentlemen's cloakroom( which promptly shut), and raiding r ve ladies cloakroom to persuade the\noccupants togo to a party \u2014 subjecting this roc m to the bottle treatment\nwhen they were removed. It is stated b v Adrian Fletcher that\nreciprocal membership facilities w t'l be withdrawn on nights of future Rugby Internationals, and rigorous\ncard checks will be in sti Bute don these nights, and, possibly, on nights\nof hops when big name groups are\ninvolved.

N Q.29 \u00bb\nCHEMISTRY SHOCK RAIL STRIKE CAUSES EXAMINATION CHAOS I PART TWO Examination Finals put forward by one week, with only a week and a half notice. This was the surprise sprung0; second year chemistry undergraduates yesterday. The decision to alter the examination dates was taken by the Head of the Chemistry Department, Professor Barrer,a f terM rE.F. Cut li ffe, the Registrar, realised that the projected rail stir ike would coincide with the examinations. The students, greatly disturbed by the halving of the remaining revision time, met the Senior Tutor, Dr Roberts, y eater day morning, and he conveyed their grievances and suggestions to Prof Barre r. Dr Roberts reported back in the afternoon that although Prof Barre r was very sympathetic, he felt that any alteration of the decision at this stage would cause too much conf usui on| this was despite suggestions from Chemistry2 that the exams should revert to the original date s,IC President Fletcher having arranged rooms or flats to be available for students living faraway. Mike Scott, RCS President, argued that the exams should be moved to the afternoons, enabling students and supervising staff to reach college on time. Letters containing notice of the change were sent to lodging and home addresses of students, but by y eater day(' Tuesday) evening maj sy had still not received official notification. Some have not even heard yet unofficially. The only hope of restoring the exams to the original dates lies in the calling off of the rail strike by Friday, which at present seems most unlikely. It should be noted that these examinations are not recognised by the University of s fe on& on until June,, but despite this Prof Barre r feels that this\" possibly unnecessary\" decision must stand, and points out that it had to be arrived at qui c ic ly.N US CONFERENCE LEADS TO LAWSUIT A COMPLEX system of grievances concerning the last NUS Conference, U magazine, SNAP, STUDENT JEW'S, Alan Evans( President of LSE), David Wi d ger y( editor of U and SNAP)& \u2022 Jj V nn kF neh s( editor of SEN NET) emerged yesterday. An action is now being brought by David Wi d ger y, and possibly also Fuchs, against MS' STU TJ ENT NEWS over reporting the Margate JUL'J conference. The publication it seems has made suggestions of plots behind the decision to leave IS C, alleging that Wi d ger y( and his co editor of SNAP RayS en yoe) and others were involved in the plot, citing as evidence an alleged statement made in the U.S. by Wi d ger y that he would edit WORLD STUDENT NEW S(anI US publication). This he denies. Wi d ger y reports that Fuchs' s grievance is that STUDENT NEWS accused him of gaining entry to the conference in Margate b; falsely claiming to represent the SUN newspaper. Fuchs, say Wi d ger y and Fletcher, actually was representing the SUN. Evans is drawn into the confused situation b> his allegation at a LSE Union meeting \u2014 and not withdrawn \u2014 that\" Wi d ger y was a Communist \u2014 over which Wi d ger y is not to sue\" in order to clear the air of mudslinging\" \u2014 and an article in SNAP that accused him of threatening to confiscate every copy of BEAVER( LSE student newspaper) if it published an article alleging that lie had misapplied Union funds. Wi d ger y says that he is to print an apology \u2014 \" all be it against my better judgement.\" IC President, Adrian Fletcher, told FELIX that such political squabbling( see also GL8S) was a good reason for IC to be out of these organisations. CLC S SQUABBLE EVANS THREATENS F If CH S ALAN EVANS^ President of LSE, was accused on the frontpage of this week's edition of SEN NET of booking rooms, without mandate, at a plush hotel in Margate for an informal meeting of the Greater London Confederation of Students. It now emerges that on Monday night a meeting of the Executive of GIGS ratified the decision to book rooms, and that SEN NET is not prepared to state categorically that the story' s basis was factual. Evans claims that he has not said he booked rooms, and, according to Jon Smith( BEAVER Editor) says,\" I will get Fuchs out of SEN NET'.\" UNIVERSITY TECHNICIANS have been awarded a6%$ pay rise following last term's strike.

Formed as an amalgamation of previous Hall\nParking Committees by Peter Hills, a Civil Engineering lecturer and\nFalmouth Hall Sub-Warden, in somewhat clouded circumstances, it\nis now getting into the stride of a carefully evolved plan of campaign\nto procure better conditions for Southside's Car Owners.\nFour cars have been rer moved from the sunken carpark and plans are\nafoot for a complete reorganization of\nthe layout of parking spaces in Southside. It is the Committee's avowed intention 'to protect the interests of the resident Southside car owners by controlling the parking in Southside'.\nA very important part of their task\nmust be to control the use of Southside facilities by non-residents and the general public. Southside is a very convenient parking place for commuters leaving their cars outside\nthe meter zone and continuing to town by bus. The proposed scheme of the Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council to limit road par king by non-residents, will increase\nthe daily morning influx of cars lo Southside.\nHopeless\nIt is a small miracle that there is free ac como dati on for90% of South side cars on private ground in such an area as SW7, not even the exp en sive modern flats ? - c und us can boast such a record. The Committee must show it accepts the responsibility for such a privilege, while increasing their effort to maximise the space available. It is worthwhile to remember that the College intended to allow parking only in the\nsunken part and none on either side\nof the access road.\nThis was perhaps a hopeless demand. Which they realised by later\ncondoning parking on one side only.\nBut what more of a neves ore is o ossi ble than a line of scaffolding,\nwhere twenty more parking cars\ncould be. Students CAN afford to run cars, the authorities must under stand and help to provide the space\nfor them. Perhaps this is, the message\nthe Parking Committee is attempting to relay, in their own quiet way. tails which must be attended to. The parking Committee is already aware\nof the amount of petty thieving from the CarPark. Spot lamps are removed, petrol tanks sucked dr v. They have suggested that a lockable gate is provided to block the easy\naccess to and from the back of the\nc^r park. They t ave also thought\nof the problem of W' \u2014 king pcc v to\nSouthside b v cars parking opposite it in the mid d'e of Exhibition Road. Apparently a suggestion to remove\nthe trouble has been put to the College authorities. Surely the easiest\nway is a poli cv of re oort in? offending\ncars to the W^ st^nm04\"\"\" Poh'ee for obstruction, until the Police make a move to have the appropriate read marking installed. Let us see Peter Hills and his\nCommittee members, all car owners,\nincrease their efforts to present the problems and their solutions to the\nCollege authorities, and for the\nauthorities to receive them as ration ally as possible.\nThefts\nLAM LEY'S TECHNICAL& GENERAL BOOKS ART MATERIALS DRAWING INSTRUMENTS STATIONERY PAPERBACKS1,3&5 Exhibition Road, London, S.W.7 What will happen when bu i'di ug begins on the new Halls of Residence\non the East Side of Princes' Gardens?

    "content": "FELIX7 Other Universities - First of Series\nUNIVERSITY IN THE LIMELIGHT\n- A LOOK AT SUSSEX\nOne of the nearer Universities to London\nis Sussex. Perhaps the most expensive\nuniversity that we have for the number of\npeople involved. Since its conception it\nhas been rarely out of the news. A fuss\nwas caused when the (Brighton Town'\nPlanning Committee rejected Sir Basil\nSpence's plan for a chapel or meeting\nhouse, because it did not fit in with the rest\nof his plans. Recently the Sunday Telegraph joined in the campaign started by\nthe Daily Mail to present the image of\nthe Sussex student as a sex-mad, orgy-loving creature.\nArches and Epstein\nLast Wednesday I went down there to find\nout what I could about the University and its\nUnion. As might be expected I found no signs\nof these things hut instead an institution tending more towards puritani im than a palace of Venus. The first thing to strike me on entering their\nUnion was large posters advertising their next\ndance \u2014 no student under the age of eighteen will be admitted. In the bara list of all students\nunder the age is kept together with photographs\nof them. It is impossible to buy a cigarette anywhere in the grounds and the girl'shall cfr? side n ce is locked at midnight. When I commented on these points a member of their Union Council was quick t jo point out that, we had a rule in London that not more than three people were to\nbe in a student's room together and that ac least\ntwo of these must be of the same sex.\nIf Imperial College can be thought of as a vertical structure then Sussex is most definitely horizontal. Designed by Sir Basil Spence, the\narchitect behind the rebuilding of Coventry Cathedral, the pattern of the buildings is one of\narches. The Union building Kke most of the\nothers, consists of large numbers of arches of\ndifferent size and shape balanced on top of each other. Together with its enigmatic Epstein and rectangular ponds its lies in the centre of the University Campus. None of the buildings is\nmore than about three storeys high which gives\na general impression of spaciousness.\nLife in the Hotels\nSo far three halls cf residence have been built to house a small part of the three thousand students. One is being used as temporary ac como dati on for part of the Arts Faculty and so\nthere is one hall for men and another for women. This, means that the majority of students have to\nlive in the town of Brighton, four miles away and aten penny bus journey. Most of them are put up in hotels and guest houses in the town for\nwhich they pay a standardised rent of four pounds\ntwo shillings a week which is deducted from maintenance grants before the grant is given to the student. Notices on the wall in one of the\nHalls of Residence reminded students that they\nwould \"be subject to disciplinary action if they\nleft before the end of the year, or went away from their room for the night without permission\nof their tutor. This also applies to students living in hotels.\nStainless Steel Art\nThere is only one refectory in the place which, I was to fd. gets very cr oude d at lunchtime. In the evening it was providing a service very similar to ours with prices which are slightly\nhigher than even Mooney' s new ones. The food,\nhowever was very much better cooked than we get, the soup was no mere apology as it is here\nbut was a full bodied Windsor for s.even pence. In the refectory, as in the rest of the University, large paintings stared down at you. These weird and odd modem works adorn every wall that is\nnot either set with flint or fancy brick, most are\npaintings but there is one wall covered with giant\nstainless steel creations. There is also a snack\nbar which serves dishes much the same as our top\nrefectory and the charges are the same.\nAbove\nRoom\nThe new Common\nBelow: Epstein in the snow\u2014\nUnion Building behind\nThe bar which sells Tankard at 2 / 4 a pint is\nagain arched with several small arches form in\" the ceiling.S eating is odd with a grid of small\ncubicles filling up the floor. The wooden nature\nof these cells suggests a beer y bar but the students\nin it seemed more typical of Southside than of\nour Union bar.One of the students commented about Sussex\nwith pride\" Most other places are jealous of\nus. I have heard of one department at another\nuniversity in which all the staff applied for one\npost here as lecturer.\" He went on later to say\nthat ha \"resents very much being at ' The Place to\nBe'.\" It seems tome though, that if anyone\nopts togo to this the, most glamourous of our new universities then he must expect to be in the\npublic eye.\nJ.
