(In fact, one interesting ideal of\nmine would be to invite that Kirsty-what ser name woman from BBC2's 'The Late Show' and let\nher review IC's architecture.) But there is one\ngood thing: at least some of the buildings are\nnamed after famous IC personalities.\nOf course, the next problem is that not many\npeople know anything about these 'famous IC\npersonalities'. Ask an average IC undergrad who\nBeit was, and he/she will probably reply: \"Err,\naren't there 8 bits in a Beit?\" So, here, exclusive\nto Felix, is 'Samin's Quick Biographies of\nFamous IC Personalities who are Remembered\nby IC as Building Names':\nHaldane: Probably the most unusual IC person-ali ty, in that Haldane was a committed Marxist\nand believed that science and socialism could\nmarch on to solve all of mankind's problems.\n(His death in 1964 meant he didn't have to face\nthe Prague Spring or the collapse of Soviet\nempire, so he died in 'un revisionist' peace.)\nHaldane's interests lay in biochemistry and\ngenetics and, in the true spirit of science, he\nwould experiment on himself and his friends\n(obviously, he lost most of them as time went\non). He suggested that, when coloni sing space,\nman should have a tail grafted onto his back, so\nas to lower his centre of gravity. Haldane's work\nduring the Second World War on the physiological aspects of life in, and escape from, midget\nsubmarines was used by the Library's architects\nin designing the study cubicles.\nHuxley: Not to be confused with Al Huxley the\nnovelist, Sir J. Huxley the biologist, or P. Huxley my dentist. A medical doctor who taught\nRoad Kitchen\nnatural history at the Royal School of Mines in\nthe late 1800s, Huxley is known for his thoughts\non the place of science in society - all this most\nunlike the traditional image of a miner.\nWilliam Penney: Mathematician and A bomb\nscientist. Worked at the Los Alamos Labs, New\nMexico and supervised the testing of Britain's second A bomb at Woomera, Australia [where's that? - Ed]. (Interesting to know whether members of IC's Environmental and Appropriate\nTechnology Society and The Australia Society\nwill attend lectures at the William Penney Labs.)\nHe is probably one of the few IC researchers to\nhave a playing field at the Atomic Weapons\nResearch Establishment, Aldermaston named\nafter him and to be made a Life Peer (Baron\nPenney of East Hendred [and where's that? -Ed].\nBeit: Err, aren't there 8 bits in a Beit?\nThere are, of course, far more 'famous IC per-son ali ties' than buildings. HG Wells (a famous\nschool teacher) and IC's three Noble Laureates\nare still missing a block of concrete with their\nname on it.\nAn interesting question is how to get a building named after you. Obviously, you have to be\ndead. Death gives you respectability and Mrs\nWindsor can't come and take away your knight-hood. (Remember the case of the 'Sir' Ronson\nGallery at the Natural History Museum?) You\nshould also have done something 'good', preferably for IC. So, while the Sir John Egan Aero\nBuilding does have a chance, I suppose the next\nbuilding would probably be named after IC's late Director of Car Park Franchising.\nCredits\nTypesetter: Music:\nRose Atkins Jon Jordan\nPrinter: Cinema:\nAndy Thompson Joe McFadden\nBusiness Manager: Theatre:\nSimon Govier Rekha Nayak\nAdvertising Manager: Opera:\nSteve Newhouse Patrick Wood\nLayout: Arts:\nKin Wei Lee Marcus Alexander\nProofing: Puzzles:\nKin Wei Lee Penguin\nMarcus Alexander Sphinx\nJuliette Decock Jaymz\nSteve Dunton\nTamsin Braisher Cartoons:\nCrisp\nFeatures:\nOwain Bennallack (Ed) Other Articles:\nPhill Henry OSC Committee\nShaun Joynson Becky Clark\nDon Adlington The Union Office Sabbs\nGareth Light Samin Ishtiaq\nHans Rutlin\nPhotography:\nMike Chamberlain Collators Last Week\nDiana Harrison Tony Grew\nIvan Chan Ivan Chan\nJoe McFadden\nNews: Penguin\nMichael Ingram Steve Newhouse\nLynn Bravey Jon Jordan\nDeclan Curry Owain Bennallack\nTim St Clair\nBooks: Declan Curry\nJuliette Decock\nArticles Deadline: Friday, 6pm Letters Deadline: Monday, 6pm "

From left to right: The mysterious SphinX (clue editor), David (collecting for\nDavid Buckle who has since completed his PhD), Eleanor Corran (Overall Winner), Annie Matthewman\n(with heard?!), Suzanne Lewin, Ian Tinegate, Trevor Addenbrooke and Penguin (grid designer).\nCongratulations from the FELiX news team.\nBY DECLAN CURRY\nAND LYNN BRAVEY\nFunding for social clubs and societies will be safeguarded under the\nGovernment's plans for reform of\ncampus Student Unions, according\nto Conservative Party officials. The\nsocieties, which range from arts\nappreciation to science fiction, were\nfacing a withdrawal of public subsidy under the original draft of the\nproposals published by the\nEducation Secretary last July. But\nthis week, the national chairman of\nConservative Students, Tim Keavan, has confirmed that ministers will implement changes in the\nbill. These will save the societies\nfrom cash starvation, but put them\nunder the direct financial control of\nuniversities.\nMr Keavan, in a radio interview,\nsaid that social societies will continue to receive public funding for\ntheir activities, with this money\ncoming directly from colleges. This\nis a change from the Government's previous position where these 'non-core' activities would be forbidden\nfrom receiving taxpayers' money.\nMr Keavan, denying a Government\nU turn, said that these societies\nwould now operate under the financial control of universities, \"free of\nunion influence\". It is understood,\nhowever, that political and possibly\nreligious societies will remain\nbanned from receiving public fund-ing.\n\"There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the bill is going\nto do. It will change what the student union runs. The union will\nhave no control. What we are doing\nis taking the money out of political\nhands and giving it directly to the\nsocieties,\" Mr Keavan told IC\nRadio.\nMr Keavan was unable to say\nwhere this public money would\ncome from, but implied that it\nwould be part of the \"block grant\"\nwhich each university already\nreceives for its union. He angrily\ndenied claims that the proposals\nwere part of a money-saving exercise.\" I will give you my assurance\nnow, as Tim Boswell [the higher\neducation minister] gave, that this is\nnot a cost cutting exercise. Funding\nfor social societies will absolutely,\ncategorically not be cut. This is not\nmy assurance - I have heard it\ndirectly and publicly from the ministers concerned.\"\nMr Keavan, who will also be\ninterviewed by BBC l's 'On the\nRecord' this Sunday, denied that the\nGovernment's plans were striking at\nthe heart of students' social lives.\n\"It is incredible when you hear the\nNUS [National Union of Students]\nsaying that, without them, students\nwon't be drinking in the bar or having fun playing sports or going to\nthe theatre. It is incredible arrogance for the NUS to say that all\nstudent life revolves around them.\nIt's absolute rubbish and when you\nlook at the bill you will realise that\nfunding is not going to be cut and\nmore money will be spent on real\nstudent services and no money will\nbe spent on silly little political\nhacks,\" he said. The NUS president,\nLorna Fitzsimons, declined to comment when asked.\nThe proposed reforms are currently being discussed by the House\nof Lords. They have become the\nsubject of a widespread revolt by\nPeers, who are alarmed at what they\nsee as new powers given to the\nEducation Secretary by the act.\nIn a mutiny of unprecedented\nscale, Lords from all parties have\nspoken out harshly against the bill,\nand Opposition Peers are predicting\na Government defeat - despite a built-in Conservative majority in\nthe Lords.\nLord Russell, Social Security\nspokesman for the Liberal\nDemocrats and professor of history\nat King's College London, told IC\nRadio that the act was \"one education bill too many\". He added that\nthe Government was planning a range of concessions to placate\nopponents.\nHe also said that the bill could\nbe challenged in the European\ncourts. His colleague, barrister Lord\nLester, has already been reported as\nsaying that the bill would infringe\nthe European Declaration on\nHuman Rights.\nAny revolt in the Lords may be\nmatched by a similar rebellion in\nthe House of Commons, with the\nformer Higher Education minister,\nRobert Jackson MP, leading the\nopposition to the act.\nMr Keavan confirmed that the\nGovernment was \"consulting with\nPeers who say they have doubts\",\nadding that the Government wants\nthe best bill for students.\nMeanwhile, the Education\nSecretary, John Patten, has been the\ntarget of death threats from hard left\norganisations. Socialist Worker\nStudent Societies in Oxford are\nreported to have told Mr Patten that\nhe would leave a recent meeting \"in\na little black hearse\".\nThis follows an event last year,\nafter which Mr Patten complained\nof his constituency surgery being\nmobbed by \"thugs\" (Felix 983). He\ncondemned the latest incident as an\nattempt to prevent free speech.\nIn another development, it has\nbeen announced that the renewal of\nMr Patten's fellowship of Hertford\nCollege, Oxford, will be discussed\nat a meeting next month.\nThis month's UGM is today in the Ents Lounge at 1pm "

    "content": "Imperial College Union 21\nWhat Have They Been Up To?\nDeputy President Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)\n(Finance & Services)\nFinance\nThe biggest thing happening in the fun world of\nmoney at the moment is budgets and five year\nplans. For those fortunate enough not to have\nanything to do with them, the budgets for each\nclub or society's expenditure is set annually and\nfive year plans are a way of planning for irregular items of expenditure. All this fun is going to\nbe happening in a Union Finance Committee\nmeeting near you in the near future. All club and\nsociety chairs/treasurers should get a budget\nclaim for 94/95 to their sub-committee as soon\nas possible. Five year plan claims should find\ntheir way into my office by 14th February.\nRemember - no claim, no do sh. If anyone needs\nany help with preparing all this then the cheerful\nFinance Office staff and myself will be delighted to give a few words of advice (i.e. \"you want\nhow much?!\").\nMinubuses\nWe will (very soon) be buying a new minibus\nfor the first time in a couple of years. This will\nbring the total back up to seven vans. Unlike the\nother six, this one will have forward facing\nseats, as recommended by the college Safety\nDirector and lots of other safety-type gadgets so\nit should be the pretty safe. (We haven't worked\nout how to make the drivers safer yet, but we're\nthinking about it.) Subject to successful applications to various sources of funding, we may be\ngetting another one to replace one of the older\nof our current ones.\nTrading\nThe bar and catering side of things are ticking\nover reasonably, although not likely to exceed\nlast year's excellent year. The Bookstore is still\ndoing really well, showing that you can keep the\nprices down and be financially sound at the\nsame time (British Telecom take note). The\nmanager and staff deserve congratulations.\nSabbatical Elections\nThe elections for next year's set of hard working\nand dedicated s a bbs are coming up and I for one\nam looking forward to them, as this time I don't have to spend the best part of a month being disgustingly nice to people. As far as I can tell,\nno-one seems to be interested in my job next\nyear (is there something I should know?), but if\nanyone wants to know more about what I do,\nthen please come in and see me in the Union\nOffice. Remember - one of the perks of the job\nis getting to write a really interesting report to\nevery U GM. That'll have people queuing up to\ndo the job I'm sure.\nSport\nI have received a limited response from the\nSports Questionnaire, but I shall be tabulating\nwhat information I have and presenting it to\nCollege. There is a meeting with the Estates\nDivision to discuss sport and the information I have received will form the basis of my response\nas to what students require from Sport and\nSports Facilities.\nThe U AU national championships are progressing with only Mens' Winter Tennis and\nMens' Squash left in the running from Imperial\nCollege. This year's results are somewhat disappointing and I will be looking into increasing the\nopportunity for sports teams to practice.\nULU Societies\nI am currently involved in developing a intercollegiate society cooperation programme. This\nis aimed at getting societies from different colleges to participate in activities together. A basic\nexample would be an intercollegiate league for\nPresident\nElection Fever\nWatch out, there's an election about. Spring\nterm, a time when a young student's thoughts\nturn to fun, laughter, sheep frolicking in meadows (speak for yourself) and elections. Yippee!\nThis is the term when we elect Union officers\nto run the Union and to represent us all in all\nwalks of College life. The first set of elections\ncoming up are the ICU Sabbatical elections.\nThese are detailed on the opposite article.\nTraining\nOnce elected, our officers need training. This is\nan area which we as a Union have neglected in\nthe past. For our student officers to be truly\neffective, we need to train them, to support them\nin their work. This term, along with other student officers, I am drawing up a full training\nprogramme for all Union Officers, from Club\nChairs to Sabbaticals, from the Accommodation\nOfficer to the Departmental Representatives.\nHowever this will cost money, quite a bit of\nmoney. There is some good news, this may be\nfunded through Government Education\nInitiatives. If this works, it will set our Union on\nthe road to being highly effective in its work for\nyou, the students of Imperial College.\nReviews and Reorganisation\nLast year, a review of the organisation of ICU\nled to the drafting of a new constitution for our\nUnion, the document that sets out how we work.\nAfter being passed by the Union, it had to be\napproved by the Governors of College. They\nChess and Bridge, which currently does not\nexist. This will eventually provide the same kind\nof organisation as sports teams currently receive.\nSociety News\nThe Social Clubs Committee are currently planning a week of events to publicise what these\ntypes of societies have to offer. The programme\nwill include films, a Brazilian Nite, stalls in the\nJCR and potential heated debate. Religious and\npolitical issues will form the centre of this week\ncommencing 7th February.\nThe Operatic Society are in the middle of the\nperformances of Chicago. The polished end\nproduct is a culmination of months of work and\nplanning, all of which was done by IC students.\nThe list of people involved is far too long to go\ninto, but they all should be congratulated on\ntheir efforts. If any of you reading this report\nhave not been to see Chicago, tonight and\ntomorrow are your final chances.\ncould not pass it as it stood due to a number of\npoints, some omissions and a need for clarity in\nsome points. We have negotiated for it to be\npassed as a working document, allowing the\nUnion's clubs and societies to run, ensuring all\nthe Union's activities take place. In the mean\ntime, the Executive have been working to\nanswer the Governors' points and to make the\nconstitution a more cohesive document for the\nUnion. We are working on a new system of governing the Union, to make it more democratic\nand more accountable to us all. All the results\nshould be reported today. This will help to make\nthe activities and services of our Students'\nUnion more relevant to everyone at Imperial.\nTuesdays\nIn a club? Want to practise sport at lunch times?\nTuesdays has always been a time where a lot of\nstudent activity happens. In the last few years,\nthe amount of time available seems to have been\nwhittled away. The result? Our sports teams cannot train as much, not all clubs work as well.\nAlong with Andrew Montgomery, ACC Chair,\nwe are working to see what can be done on this\nand other sporting problems. More on this as it\nunfolds.\nI hope to see you at the Union General Meeting,\nFriday 28th,1 pm, Ents Lounge. If anyone has\nanything they would like to discuss, please come\nand see me, Andy Wensley, in the Union Office.\nUntil Friday, amigos.\nUnsure about UGMs? Any sabbatical will be glad to help you\n\n"

Ever called for\nthose two long lost brothers Ralph and Huey?\nYes, I'm talking about that most basic of functions vomiting, barfing, the tech nicol our yawn...you see, there's this guy and he does it all\nthe time. His name is Stevie Starr, and his trademark isn't downing fifteen pints of Guiness and\nthen delivering his dinner all over the floor.\nHe's a little more sophisticated than that, he'll\ndevour anything from lOp pieces to Rubic Cube\n(he can even turn the sides in his stomach!) and\nbring them back.\nBelieve me, if you go and see this guy, make\nsure that your you've eaten a long time ago and\nyour stomach is well and truly settled, if the\nactions don't get you, the sound will make your\nskin crawl. He recently appeared on the Emma\nFreud show on Radio One, and the gurgling\nw retching noise was a thing to witness. Stevie is\na bit of an expert though so there's no need to\nworry, starting when he was only four years old,\nthere have been a few years of practice to hone\nthis rather peculiar talent. Among the stunts that\nStevie performs, is swallowing a bowl of dry\nsugar followed by a glass of water, and (don't ask me how he does it) he brings the sugar back\nup completely dry. Now, that's what I call a party trick, imagine this guy in the sixth form!\nIf you want to witness his rather strange tal-ents, he is coming to Imperial on Friday 4th February. He has appeared on TV and radio,\nand it isn't really surprising when you think that\nthere's no-one else out there who can do this\ntype of thing. Considering what it must do to his\nstomach muscles that's probably not such a bad\nthing. He has been checked over by whole bus\nloads of doctors and the secret of his talent\nremains to be discovered.\nIt is quite a sight to behold, at the front of the\nstage, with some of the most disgusting noises\nyou have ever heard hanging in the air, to see\nhim swallow everything in sight from a ring to a light bulb to a snooker ball. It is said that the\nonly way men could appreciate the pain of childbirth is to pass out a bowling ball, perhaps\nStevie Starr is going to be the closest the male\npopulation is ever going to get to that?\nWelsh Soc A Credit To IC\nWomen's Football\nIC 1 - 6 London Hospital\nBy all rights the match should have been a blowout. Based on last term's results the score\nshould have been 15-0, against! But we came\nout strong and surprised the other team, not to\nmention ourselves and were soon up 1-0, thanks\nto a great run by Paula who picked up the ball at\nthe halfway line and carried it herself by the\ndefence to the box and scored with a far post\nshot. London Hospital didn't know what to do -they only made it out of their own half once in\nthe first twenty minutes. But they pulled themselves together and by halftime the score was 2-1.\nWe had the wind against us in the second\nhalf (not to mention our fitness, or lack thereof).\nDespite numerous goal scoring opportunities we\nbegan to feel the pressure of playing the top\nteam in the league. By 35 minutes into the half\nwe were down 4-1. London Hospital topped it\noff with two goals in the last ten minutes to\nmake the final score 6-1, a respectable score\ngiven the opposition.\nAnyone interested in playing Women's Football should contact Christine DeWolf via\nthe Union pigeonholes.\nHappy New Year, or should I say Blwyddyn\nNewydd Dda! After a fairly lively first term for\nthis newly created Society, Welsh Soc is organising its future events. There will be the usual\nonce a month (last Friday thereof) trip to the\nLondon Welsh Club. The next one will be on\n28th January, meeting in Southside at 7.30pm. On the 'overseas' front, the Society is planning a weekend in Brussels for the end of\nFebruary (travelling overnight of course) and is\nalso planning to attend the Welsh University\nIntercollegiate Eistedfed on the weekend of the\n10th12 th February. This not only involves participating in the more cultural events but also in\nthe 'Pub Eistedfed', at which I am sure we will\ndo very well.\nWe are also hoping to be introduced to the\nHouses of Parliament by one of the Welsh MPs\nand will have a stall in the JCR in the forthcoming 'SCC Week'. Volunteers to run the stall are\nbeing sought. Finally, for those that would like\nto see a major sporting event, we will be going\nto see Wales vs Norway at Cardiff in March.\nTickets will be on a first come first served basis\nso come along on Friday to put your name\ndown.

All seemed under\ncontrol at the other end with Crispian Lord and\nVice-Captain Ed Jenkins solid in defence, whilst\nthe watchful Rob Franolie was quick to drive\nforwards for the midfield.\nMid-way through the second half UCL scored at the third attempt - twice being denied\nby man of the match Guy Williams. Guy continued to impress with a series of magnificent\nsaves. Three minutes from time, IC levelled\nwith a cannonball free kick delivered by Ed\nJenkins turned in by the head of Richard Salter.\nSuper-sub Maddy came on for extra time,\nwhich ended with UCL snatching the winner\nthree minutes from a penalty shoot-out with a deflected shot looping over a helpless Williams.\nA credit to IC, the team was: Guy Williams,\nEd Jenkins, Rob Franolie, Lawrence Stolworthy,\nRichard Craig, Crispian Lord, Roddy Herds,\nAnthony Clerc, Peter Linney, Javier Madurga\n(Maddy), Richard Salter and James Diss.\nIt can be found in the centre pages of every issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "16 Reviews\niii ii Xerxes\nNicholas Hytner's celebrated English National\nOpera production of Handel's Xerxes has\nreturned to the Coliseum in a revival directed by\nJulia Hollander.\nXerxes was first performed at the Haymarket\nin London in 1738. The composer was already in\nthe grip of his final illness, which explains the\nextensive borrowing s from earlier works that are\nto be found in the opera. Nevertheless, the end\nresult is an integrated work which uses the conventions of opera seria to tell a sophisticated\nand humorous comic story.\nThe plot consists of a very tangled web of\nlove involving Xerxes, King of Persia, his brother Arsamenes and their passionate ard our for\nRomilda, the d aug her of Ariodates, commander\nof Xerxes' army. Also involved are Atlanta\n(another daughter of Ariodates, secretly in love\nwith Arsamenes), Elviro the facetious servant\nand Amastris, sole heiress to the neigh-bou ring kingdom and betrothed to Xerxes.\nGot that? Well, things are further comp-li cat ed for the audience by the fact that, in line with\ncommon 18th century practice, the role of\nArsamenes was written for a castrato, that is, a male soprano whose upper register was prolonged beyond puberty by castration. Nowadays\nsuch roles are usually assigned to women, but at\nChristopher Robson as Arsamenes and Louise Winter as Xerxes (photo by Justin Pumfrey)\nENO the part of Arsamenes is sung with haunting beauty by counter-tenor Christopher Robson.\nXerxes, on the other hand, is portrayed by a woman: Louise Winter admirably embodies the\nanguish of courting as 'all the ten thousand\nGriefs, Impatiences and Resentments, that render a Man un amiable in the Eyes of the Person\nwhose Affection he solicits'. Outstanding among\nthe other members of the cast is the Romilda of\nYvonne Kenny who delivers with astonishing\nvivacity and agility.\nThe slow-moving first act is more than compensated for by the second and third acts, in\nwhich the story and the true splendour of\nHandel's music unfurl between dramatic\nchanges of set. The orchestra played magically\nfor conductor Ivor Bolton, complementing the\ndiffering roles with beautiful precision. The marital fisticuffs in the final act are particularly\nentertaining, although Handel's comic genius\nwas made a parent throughout the opera by\nENO's thoroughly enjoyable production.\nRekha Nayak and Wu Xiao Dan\nIn rep at the London Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, WC2N 4ES.

Unveiling the secret\nworld of cryptic clues is like publicly demonstrating the free-mason handshake - that's the\none with the white pin ny and the garden trowel,\nbrother.\nTrue, by following this crash-course in clue\nsolving you'll miss out on the enjoyable process\nof teaching yourself. However the aim is to\ninstruct our unenlightened readers on the types\nof clue that exist and then how to distinguish\nthem from each other. One compensation for me\nis that in future I can stop insulting your intelligence with the easy clues that have appeared in\ncrosswords past.\nAlthough there are (unwritten) rules for solving cryptic clues, qualifiers like \"nearly always\"\nand \"more often than not\" are inevitable because\nmaking absolute statements about these clues is\ndangerous. It is safe to say one thing though:\nclues need not mean what they say but they\nmust say what they mean. A good clue is written in such a way as to imply something completely different from - or irrelevant to - the\nintended answer.\nA general rule of thumb is never to read the\nclue literally (well, almost never). Secondly,\nCracking Cryptic Crosswords remember that if you can solve the quick/coffee-time crossword puzzles then you can also solve\ncryptic clues. They always contain a straightforward definition or synonym of the answer (well,\nalmost always). In fact most clues will contain\ntwo ways of getting the answer making them\neasier than quick crosswords! Follow these\nguidelines and you'll be armed with an effective\narsenal of clue cracking techniques, dazzling the\nignorant Philistines that never progressed from\ncoffee-time clues.\nSo, what can you expect in this space in the\nweeks to come? In short - a Pandora's Box of\nhints and tips, illustrated with examples of types\nof clues previously printed in Felix. Bear in\nmind though, that although I will be isolating\ndifferent clue types, real life clues will often be\nan amalgamation of two or more styles. If you\nhave any sense, you'll hoard all the relevant\nFelices too so as not to give anyone else an\nadvantage over you in the ensuing Easter 3D crossword. Mind your mind.\na lottery. Therefore, a cryptic clue can be composed of two different meanings of the word\n'DRAW' such as:\nDesign a tie (4) or Pull off the raffle (4)\nThe clue doesn't just have to contain two synonyms (one for each meaning).

At\n6pm, The Hunger, adapted from Whitley\nStreiber's novel of decaying vampires but probably more renowned for its bloodletting lesbian\nsex scenes (blatant advertising ploy, anyone?).\nAt 8pm we present Nicholas Roeg's multifaceted The Man Who Fell To Earth, another\nbook adaptation. Bowie stars this time as an\nalien come to Earth bearing great scientific\nknowledge in an attempt to save his dying\nplanet. ET this certainly isn't as he is discovered\nby the government, indulges in surreal and\ntotally gratuitous sex with a woman he met in a lift and slowly degenerates into a drunken alien\nsot.\nBoth films are free to ICS F members.\nMembership costs just \u00a33 and gets you free\nentry to our video projected double bills, the\nchance to borrow over 3,000 books, videos and\ngraphic novels from our library in the corner of\nBeit Quad and reduced entry to our 35mm presentations including your first film free.\nOn Tuesday at 7pm in the Concert Hall, we\nhave the explosive SF action comedy\nDemolition Man. Tough cop Sylvester Stallone\nis in the 21st century, thawed out from a cryogenic sleep sentence (for a crime he did not\ncommit) to combat a psychotic criminal who\nwas also frozen in 1996. Stallone's character has\nto deal with a rampaging Wesley Snipes with a silly haircut, as well as contending with the new\nmorals of 2036 society: no swearing, no s mok ing, no sex and everyone humming 'classic'\nadvertising jingles.

Chicago, the musical, has all of this plus\na little bit more.\nChicago starts with Roxie Hart murdering\nher one night stand as he tries to walk out on\nher. She is then arrested after attempting to\nframe her husband and is kept in jail to await her\ntrial. One of her fellow prisoners is Velma Kelly\nwho is also waiting for her day in court where\nshe will be charged with the murder of her husband and sister.\nBoth women are being defended by Billy\nFlynn, a lawyer of dubious reputation, who has\nnever failed to get an acquittal for any of his\nwomen clients if given five thousand dollars. He\ndoes this by manipulating the media and then the\njury.\nIn agreeing to represent Roxie he is forced to\npush Velma, currently Queen of the Chicago\nheadlines off the front page. The battle for the\nfront page and freedom has started.\nChicago is an amateur production but per-fi IMJ 8.BIMIMF IUT PIHI III\nformed in part with the slickness of a professional show. The set is very creative and used very\neffectively. The on-stage band, which has a very\nstrong jazz sound to match the era, performs\nadmirably. All the musical leads are excellent,\nespecially Kirsty Bennett as Roxie Hart and\nMarlaine Anfelides as Velma Kelly. However,\nthe big dance scenes are occasionally hampered\nby a lack of space.\nAll in all, an excellent, enjoyable and, in\nplaces, funny show.\nReview by Steven Newhouse\nThere are only two\ndays left to see Chicago.\nIt is showing tonight and tomorrow in\nthe Great Hall. Doors open 7pm. Tickets are \u00a36 (cones \u00a34) from the\nImperial College Union Office.\nNo, there is not going to be any ban on chewing\ngum here and neither is there any proposal for\nsuch a move. The ban has, however, been put\ninto force in Singapore. Surprise, surprise! But\nwhereabouts is of this place called Singapore. Is\nit in China? No, though it's closer to China than\nit is to London. Singapore is just north of the\nEquator, at the southern tip of the Peninsular\nMalaysia. Being a tropical island country, it is a much warmer and sunnier place than London.\nLittle is known of the early history of\nSingapore. According to the colourful and vivid\nSejarah Melayu 'Malay Annals', Singapore was\nsupposedly discovered by a Malay ruler, Sir Tri\nBuana in the 13th Century. Caught in the storm\nat sea one day, he was forced to land on the\nisland to seek refuge. On sighting an animal\nwhich he mistook for a lion, he decided to establish a settlement there which he aptly named\nSingapura (\"The Lion City').\nModern Singapore was founded in 1819 by\nSir Stamford Raffles, a Britain. Singapore\nbecame part of a British settlement and then a Crown Colony. It gained independence in 1965\nand it was on its way to establishing itself in the\ninternational scene. (Are you still thinking about\nthe chewing gum ban? It made headlines in the\nGerman papers.) Changi International Airport,\nvoted best airport in the world, is a result of\nmeticulous planning and hard work. The pace of\neconomic growth refuted doubts from the international community about the survival of a small\ncountry devoid of natural resources.\nA cosmopolitan country, Singapore surprises\nmany with the harmony between its various ethnic groups. While maintaining their own unique\ncultures amongst Western technology, the harmony has created a melting pot that merits the\nremark that it is a place 'where the East truly\nmeets the west'.\nFind out more about Singapore at the exhibition 'Swing Singapore'. It will be held in the\nGreat Hall, Sherfield Building, from 9am to 5pm on 2nd February. See you there!\nSee Demolition Man for only \u00a32 on Tuesday in the Concert Hall\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nGoodwill in the Season of Greed\nYou've probably forgotten Christmas now...too much food, telly and too man\nsuperfluous presents are hardly the stuff of memories. But volunteering for\nhomeless helpers Crisis gave Shaun Joynson a yuletide to recall with pride.\nWhen Jesus fed the five thousand, he got by on\nfive loaves and a few fish. When, some 2,000\nyears later, the Crisis team tried the same trick\nwith a smaller number of London's homeless\ngathered to celebrate his birthday, the logistics\nwere a little more involved.\nFor an idea of the scale of the operation -feeding, clothing and sheltering London's homeless for seven days, start by working out what\none person needs for a single day's comfort during the festive season. Next, multiply that by\nseven and then by a couple of thousand. Just\nthinking about the sheer size of the task would\nbe enough to ulcerate the stomach of even the\nmost experienced Trust House Forte executive.\nCrisis manage the task with 'Volunteers',\npeople who, in the season of goodwill, give the\nmost important gift of all: their time. Three years\nago, thoughts about the real nature of Christmas\nprompted me to become one such Volunteer.\nNowadays, I could not think of spending\nChristmas any other way.\nCrisis at Christmas started in 1986 when an\nimportant gap in the Christmas market was spot-ted. Throughout the year the needy and the lonely were helped by a multitude of charities. But\nthen, come Christmas, these charities closed,\ncasting hundreds overboard from the ship of\nmerriment into the cold sea of London's streets.\nThe strongest might manage to tread water, the\nweakest drowned.\nCrisis began with a food run. Three years\nlater, it opened its first Christmas shelter, gradually expanding to provide food, clothing and\nshelter for up to a thousand people a day during\nthe Christmas period.\nThe 'Open Christmas' has grown each year.\nSome tub-thumping politicians may blame this\non Government policies, but it is probably more\nlikely that homelessness has always existed on\nthis scale, but only now\nis it being realised. Crisis\noperates all the year\nround now, so the ' At Christmas' bit of the\ncharity's name was\ndropped a couple of\nyears ago.\nDuring the 1993\n'Open Christmas' (so-called because all in need, not just the homeless\nare welcome), the Times ran a feature comparing\nthe Christmas of guests at the Lanesborough,\nLondon's most exclusive hotel with the guests at\nthe Crisis centre, another exclusive but not nearly as expensive hotel in South East London.\nI reckon that the guests at Crisis probably got\nthe better deal. The Lanesborough guests might\nhave walked in wearing expensive clothing, but\nCompanionship is\nthe best thing a volunteer can offer\na Crisis guest\nwhen many of the Crisis guests who'd visited\nthe clothing store left, they were able to\nfavourably compare their clothes with those\nowned by the Rolls Royce driver. And, should\nany Londoner wonder why people sleeping in\ndoorways are wearing expensive hiking boots,\nGucci Loafers or Church's brogues, it's because\nas a former cobbler, I got great satisfaction from\nensuring they got them while working on the\nCrisis footwear operation.\nThe first thing a Crisis Volunteer learns is\nthat those people, whom\nSir George Young might\nstep over coming out of\nthe opera, are humans\nwith interesting stories to\ntell. Those who want to\ntalk will and those who\ndon't won't. Simple as\nthat. One's psychic sense\nis quickly honed in such\ncircumstances, with the extra sensory antenna\nsoon letting you know who you can chat to, and\nwho'll give you a mouthful of abuse or a right-hand er if you so much as look at them.\nI find the olde-world e charm bit works best.\nThe guest seeking information is greeted with a smile and a polite 'yes sir or madam'. And if one\npromises to do something for them, one has to\nstick to it, come hell or high water. It's no good\nbeing all goody-goody and adopting compassionate poses with the guests because they can\nspot patron is ation faster than they can spot a copper when they're out begging.\nAs our shift leaders always say, companionship is the best thing a volunteer can offer a Crisis guest. For fifty one weeks of the year\nthey're out in all weathers, ignored, sneered at -even hated by some. So the chance of a good\nnat ter with a friendly face is looked forward to\nby some guests even more keenly than the lash-in gs of hot food on offer.\nThose 'good natt ers' reveal some interesting\nand sometimes harrowing secrets. However,\nthough such revelations might make good read-ing, one has to remember that one has been\nadopted as a friend by someone usually friendless and so I always ensure that things I'm told\nby guests remain confidential.\nI found myself worrying about the guests\nafter my first shifts. Even now, the biggest difficulty I have is getting to sleep after a duty. One\nexperiences a sort of buzz. Energy flows at a rapid rate around one's body, so much so that\nafter that first duty ended around midnight, I marched from the Crisis site in South East\nLondon back to my home in Ealing, some fifteen\nmiles and four hours away. When the buzzing\nstops, the switch between hyper-consciousness\nand oblivion is instantaneous. One sleeps round\nFancy being President for a year? Find out how on page 20\n\n"

    "content": "A Little Shop Of Horrors?\nPhill Henry investigates the queer folk in the heart of Covent Garden.\nI had gone to great pains to avoid black cats, ladders and elderly was her folk, but on the day I went to meet Simon Patten of Mysteries, a Covent Garden occult shop, I was jinxed.\nFirstly, my dicta phone broke down. No problem,\nI thought. I borrowed a second. It too failed.\nThen my progress was further hampered by a security alert on the Northern Line.\nWhen I finally got there, the first thing\nwhich struck me on entering was the perfume of\nexotic incenses. The slow, New Age music quietly playing added to the calm and slightly\ndreamy atmosphere. Although books take up a large part of the wall space, the shop exhibits\nmany other delights for the enthusiastic or wilfully unwary consumers. Moonstones, crystals\nand colourful Tarot packs are stocked along with\nvirgin inks and wax for spell casting and invocations. As I browsed I noticed a small vial containing a red liquid with 'Dragon's Blood' written on the label.\n\"It isn't real Dragon's Blood!\" laughed\nSimon. \"It is just a mixture of ingredients used\nby some people to perform their ceremonies.\"\nSimon is quite obviously very enthusiastic\nabout the whole occult scene. A likable and\nchatty man in his thirties, certainly not one to\nstand on ceremony, he completely lacked the\nimmediate aura of mystery which I could not\nhelp expecting. Although tall with alert blue\neyes, his manner was calm and laid back.\nThis is just as well. \"We get people coming\nin who think that they have been cursed,\" he\nsaid. \"Ninety nine times out of a hundred they\nare just imagining it. We calm them down, give\na little reassurance and then they go away.\nOccasionally, we meet people who are genuinely\nharassed - they wake to find black, dead roosters\nhanging from their door posts. Then it becomes a matter for the police.\"\nI asked him about his more bizarre clientele\nand whether he gets Satanists prowling around.\n\"Yeah. They dress in black robes and stare a lot,\" he said contorting his face to illustrate.\n\"They are strange. We don't get them coming in\nvery often. This is not the kind of place for an\nabject Satanist. But when they do come in, you\ncan spot them a mile off.\"\n\"You would be surprised who comes in here.\nSometimes we get witches walking in - they are\njust normal women who really dress the part.\nOther times we get Fundamental Christians\nprotesting on our doorstep,\" he sighs. Nothing in\nthe shop is anti-Christian. He goes to great\nlengths to explain that all world religions are\ncatered for.\nWitches and satanists are not the only cus-to mers. Indeed, I saw no black cloaked strangers\nstaring disconcerting ly at all. I asked him what\nthe usual people who shop at Mysteries are like.\n\"We get all sorts, though there is definitely a bias towards female customers; about 70 percent\nare female, I would say.\"\nSince it was now approaching lunch time the\nshop was filling up with power dressed women\nand city men in grey suits. Most of them were\nperusing books on psychology, mainly stress\nmanagement and relationship improvement.\nThese books are largely American and focus on\ndown to Earth self-improvement programmes.\n\"Californian hippy stuff,\" Simon disdainfully\ncalls them, looking at the throng.\n\"New Age thinking has always been\naround,\" he explained. \"But, thanks to the sixties\nand an even more recent revival, it has come to\nthe fore.\"\nMysteries was founded in 1982, largely for\nno other reason than a gap in the market existed.\nSince then, there have been many other\noccultists who have set up shop in the West End.\nDespite this and the recession, Simon declares\nthat sales have not dropped dramatically. It\nappears that New Age-ism is here to stay.\nIt is, perhaps, unsurprising that London has\nsuch a large magical industry since its history is\nfull of ancient religions and secret sects. Many\nchurches and other religious buildings are built\non the sites of pagan temples. Few Londoners\nknow that Westminster Abbey is constructed on\nthe remains of a Druidic college or that St Paul's is built on an ancient Roman temple dedicated to\nJupiter. Ley-lines, the supposed invisible lines of\nforce joining sacred sites, traverse the city by the\ndozen making London one of the biggest junctions in the world.\n\"London has got a fairly good occult and\npagan scene with a reasonable number of discussion groups,\" Simon told me. A few yards away,\nin Neal's Yard, an office advertises all sorts of\nevents from hypnotism weekends in Inverness to\nTarot workshops in Acton Town.\nThe most popular books on sale are about\nastrology and Tarot reading. Mysteries has\nseized upon this public interest and offers a personal divination service. The Tarot reading service is performed by Simon himself. \"I would\nnot like to comment on the accuracy of my fortune telling,\" he said. However, he did tell me of\nhis last attempt. \"I suddenly said to the customer\nthat they had spent the last six months in the\nAfrican Jungle. It actually turned out be the\nIndian Jungle but they were still impressed.\"\nSpooky. Is he frightened by such unusual\nthings? \"No. I have never been frightened by\nanything which people would call supernatural.\"\n\"Magic is all around us,\" he says with a smile. \"I shocked a friend when I told her that\nwe all perform ritual magic now and then.\nBefore we go out for a night 'on the pull' we\noften have a scented bath, put on our best clothes\nand maybe take a lucky charm. This is no different from the love rituals performed by pagans\nthousands of years ago.\"\nI smiled that people still believed such super-st it ion. Then, after buying my Sandalwood bath\nsalts, rose incense and love talisman, I headed\nhomewards.\nA series on solving cryptic crosswords starts on the back page\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 15\nThe Transformed Cell\n(Unlocking the Mysteries of Cancer)\nby Steven Rosenberg, PhD\nFor anyone who wants to know what research is\nall about and what can motivate someone to\nwork fifteen hours a day all year long, then\nSteven Rosenberg's biography is the perfect\nbook to read.\nSteven Rosenberg is one of the most famous\ncancer researchers and surgeons working at the\nNational Cancer Institute, which is a part of the\nNational Institute of Health, in the States. His\nfight against this disease started 25 years ago.\nAs a young surgeon, he encountered the case of\na man who cured himself of a \"terminal cancer\".\nFrom this, he decided that it should be possible\nto stimulate the bodies own immune defence\nsystem to kill cancerous cells.\nHe spent the next 25 years of his life developing this idea (and he still does). The first step\ninvolved extracting tumours from patients, transplanting them into pigs, collecting the white\ncells produced in response by the pigs and\ninjecting them into the patients. He then went on\nto culture white cells found in tumours with\nInterleukin 2 (a growth factor) and injected them\ninto patients. The current research is based on\ngene therapy, where the gene for a tumour suppressing factor is inserted into the genome of the\npatient.\nIn his biography he relates all the laboratory\nwork by his team as well as the clinical trials.\nHe takes the reader through not only the exaltation felt when an experiment works (we all\nknow how uncommon this is!) or when a patient\nis responding to a drug, but also through the desperation and feeling of uselessness after the\ndeath of patients he had got to know. Although\nno cure has yet been found, he has obtained\nresults that no other treatments have achieved.\nBut more than just the summary of his\nresearch, the book is the story of a team fighting\nagainst a disease and the everyday life of this\nquest for a cure.\nFor those who don't know anything about\nbiology or biochemistry, don't let it worry you\nas all the scientific words are explained in basic\nwords, so that anyone (anyone around College at\nleast) can understand what he is going on about.\nAdd a slice of humour to all this every now\nand then and you get The Transformed Cell, a great book in all of its aspects.\nThe Frog\nPublished by: Phoenix\nPrice: \u00a35.99\nDirectory of\nVolunteering\nby Jan Brownfoot and\nFrances Wilks\nIf you are interested in working for a charity\neither voluntarily or full time then this is the\nbook for you, as it includes both voluntary and\nemployment opportunities.\nThe directory is a comprehensive guide to\nover 500 major voluntary organisations ranging\nfrom Help the Aged and NSPCC to the Family\nPlanning Association and national association of\nCity Farms. The book also includes museums,\ncharity shops, law, counselling and holiday\nschemes. So if you are keen to do something\ngood for nothing but a good feeling then this is\nthe book for you.\nThe book is easy to use, having a clear layout\nand a helpful section on how to apply for voluntary jobs. There's lots of good advice as well.\nI would recommend that you buy this book if\nyou are very keen on working for charities or on\na voluntary basis. If you are only slightly keen\nthen have a look at someone else's copy (this\none lives in the Rag Office).\nJane\nPublished by: Directory of social Change\nPrice: \u00a37.95\nMy God Is Better Than Your God...\nJust a few yards from College, something wie rd is going on. Nobody knows what it's going to\nbe, but they do know where. The Serpentine\nGallery nestles in the heart of Hyde Park and\nbeneath its picturesque and innocent facade is a veritable torture chamber of the most avant\ngarde of modern art - last summer it made the\nheadlines by showing Robert Gober's somewhat\nliterally titled 'Genital Wallpaper'. For those\nwho dare to venture beyond the comforting\nwomb-like surrounds of College during their\nlunch hours, they will find a typically unusual\ndisplay on show at the moment.\nThe first thing that you notice on entering is\nthat nobody is looking at the paintings, but they\nare all watching the walls instead. This apparently bizarre phenomenon makes sense when\nyou realise that the walls are the art. Wall to\nWall is an exhibition by various artists who paint\ndirectly onto the spaces they occupy rather than\nusing canvasses. The six artists on display here\nhave each been provided with their own personal\nspace with which they were free to do whatever\nthey wished. What they wished to do proves to\nbe rather obscure. The word 'challenging'\nsprings to mind...or perhaps 'challenged', conceptually challenged. What does it all mean?\nBaumgarten has painted words on the walls\nof the central room, using the lantern in the ceiling as a central feature. The words them-selves\nseem unimportant, and possibly came from a Kodak brochure - but who knows?\nMichael Craig-Martin (who once shocked the\ncultural tourists by declaring a glass of water to\nbe an oak tree) has given the Serpentine Gallery\nanother example of his latest one-man-band wag on. He paints the walls in day-g lo colours, blank\nsheets of lurid greens, purples and blues. Onto\nthese are overlaid simplistic images of household objects - books, radiators, filing cabinets.\nWhy? Niele Toroni has spent the last 27 years\nmaking regularly spaced marks on walls with a brush. He has done the same here.\nLawrence Weiner, on the other hand, writes\nsentences and equations. His wall says: A ROPE\n(OF HEMP) + A CABLE (OF STEEL) + A THREAD (OF SILK) & BRAIDED (ALL\nTOGETHER).\nThe other two artists are women. Whilst the\nmen have lapsed into their navel gazing o bsc uri ty, the women have gone the other way. They\nmake obvious statements in obvious manners.\nJessica Diamond's comment on Zen Buddhism\ncould only be amusing to those who know nothing about Zen.\nBarbara Kruger has painted every surface of\nher room with violent tirades of self-love and\nhatred. It deserves recognition just because of its\narrogance but, apart from that, it is rather crass.\nThe difficulty with this exhibition is its\nambiguous ness. The art could easily be\ndescribed as the most important work of the\ntime, startlingly original and intellectual, whilst\nalso being witty and challenging the everyday\nview of painting. However, it would be just as\neasy to describe it as a worthless waste of time.\nUnfortunately, just this once you'll have to\ndecide for yourselves by making the oh-so-strenuous journey to the Serpentine Gallery, because\nthe critic can't decide (although he does admit to\nliking the Weiner).\nMA Wall to Wall: 19th Jan - 27th Feb. Serpentine\nGallery, Kensington Gardens. 10am6 pm daily. Admission FREE!\nThere is a Singapore exhibition on 2nd February in the Great Hall\n\n"

    "content": "4 Feature\nNo Need for Martyrs in the Master Class\nThere is life after your first degree - but problems too, says Don Adlington,\nImperial College Student Counsellor in this, his second welfare article.\nAdvanced course students, from a student counsellor's perspective, are seen as a rather special\npopulation. Special in the sense that they are\nmore immediately at risk when things go wrong\nthan other student populations, such as undergraduates or research students.\nWhy is this so? What are the factors that\nmake one-year advanced course students potentially vulnerable?\nA common pattern of such courses at\nImperial College (with a few exceptions) is two\nterms of intensive teaching culminating in examinations followed by a major piece of project\nwork. Clearly, any disturbing life-event coinciding particularly with the heavy teaching component of the course, can have a quite disproportionate impact on a student's academic progress.\nAn undergraduate or a research student dealing\nwith exactly the same sort of problems may,\nother things being equal, be able to absorb a period of academic under-performance, simply\nbecause there is time to do so.\nMany masters degree students have returned\nto University after an extended break from academic study, usually after a period of employ-ment. It is not uncommon for people who have\npreviously had a successful and buoyant academic experience at ' A' Level and at first degree\nlevel, to be very surprised at the extent to which\nthey have slipped out of the academic mode and\nto find that the necessary adaptation is a good\ndeal more hazardous than they had expected.\nA high proportion of advanced course students are self-financing, and have taken on quite\nlarge debt commitments to pay college fees and\nliving expenses for a full twelve months.\nOccasionally students take on these extra debts\nbefore they have had the opportunity of clearing\ndebts incurred while they were undergraduates.\nOlder students, sometimes with onerous family\nobligations, have often given up well-paid work\nto come back to college, but find that state provision for the family is inadequate.\nStudents sometimes use Masters degree\ncourses to vindicate something in their past. For\nexample, someone who achieved a class of first\ndegree lower than he/she had expected, or who\nhad been disappointed at not obtaining admission to the University of their choice after ' A' Levels may well have, as a perfectly valid component of motive, a powerful need to prove\nsomething to him or herself. In these circumstances the prestige and standing of Imperial\nCollege can be highly seductive, but conversely\nthe fear of failure can be very disturbing.\nFor a significant number of students returning\nto University after a protracted interval, a Masters course coincides with other major\nupheavals in life. It may indeed effectively be a vehicle for hopes and ambitions for the future\nwhich go well beyond the conventional notion of\nacquiring an extra qualification. This 'fresh-start' component motive is entirely valid and\nhealthy in itself, but does imply that any worry\nabout completing the course successfully carries\nan extra charge of anxiety.\nStudents on a Masters degree course are likely to be far less homogeneous than the average\ndepartmental undergraduate intake. People of\ndifferent ages and background, from different\ncountries, different disciplines and different uni-vers i ties. This sometimes means that peer-group\nsupport, or indeed the normal opportunities for\nfriendship, are not so assured. This, and the pressure of work, may effectively exclude the student from a balanced social life.\nany disturbing life-event ... can have a quite disproportionate\nimpact on a student's academic progress.\nThis coincidence of short, highly intensive\ncourses and a fair proportion of students with\ncomplex personal and family obligations (as\nwell as complex motives), seems to me to give a certain urgency to dealing with problems if they\narise. Masters degree students need to feel\nsecure in the decision they have made, to feel an\nunderlying confidence both that the course is\nwhat they wanted when they enrolled and that\nthey will be successful in it. It is, I think, normal\nto feel a certain reticence about 'asking for\nhelp'.\nPostgraduate students, almost by definition,\nare coping, competent and successful people and\nit certainly goes against the grain to have to\nacknowledge that one is having difficulty. But\nonce the little barrier of pride is overcome and\nthere has been a proper dialogue with the right\npeople, the rewards can be immediate and con-side r able. If, for example, one particular part of\nthe course is proving worrying ly difficult, there\nis a real danger that the anxiety will halo over on\nto other parts of the course unless the matter is\nproperly discussed with academic staff. Students\noften perceive academic staff as being overwhelmingly busy - which may be objectively\ntrue - but it is also quite often a rational is ation for a fundamental reluctance to face up to potential trouble.\nthere is a real danger\nthat the anxiety will\nhalo over on to other\nparts of the course\nSo far as academic worries are concerned, the\nkey people are the academic staff teaching the\ncourse. Every department in College has a Postgraduate Tutor, who has an overriding\nresponsibility for the pastoral care of graduate\nstudents in just the same way that the Senior\nTutor has for undergraduates. The College\nTutors, Dr Gareth Jones in Physics and Dr\nMargaret Goodgame in Chemistry, have a College-wide responsibility of the same kind and\nmay be approached directly.\nHowever, there are other people in College\non whom you can make demands - the Student\nAdviser in the Union (especially about any legal,\nfinancial, state benefit or Home Office problems), the doctors and nurses in the Health\nCentre, the Student Accommodation Office and\nmyself. My work is entirely confidential. I can\nsee people quickly, usually on the same day and\nI am paid to do nothing else but talk to students.\nI strongly believe that talking is very important\nin a crisis. It is a relief in itself to talk through\none's anxieties - to share the worry if you like -in a safe place. It is a way of identifying problems clearly and it sometimes throws up new\nideas for dealing with difficulties.\nDon Adlington's office is at 15 Princes Gardens\nand his telephone extension is 3041.\nThe final article by Don Adlington will be in next week's issue\n\n"

    "content": "14 Features\nAlison shopped at Top Man.\nA fact that only really sank in after ten minutes of besotted ly trailing her through aisles of\nburgundy coloured shirts and novelty underwear.\nYes I was surprised, but quietly confident that\nshe knew what she was doing.\nAlison, you see, could do no wrong. She was\nthe girl with whom I shared views on the mismanagement of the economy, the rape of the\nNational Health Service and the perversity of\ninner city degradation and homelessness. She\nwas the girl who had asked me if I liked the\nSmiths, and what did / think of Billy Bragg?\nThis was the girl that understood that the way to\nbeat Big Jack's Irish strategy was to play two\nconventional wide wingers against the four four\ntwo system as it would tie up their full backs so\nmuch that they would never cross the halfway\nline. This was the girl that had heard of Fredrico\nFellini. Yes, she was at least as boring and pretentious as me. The Ideal Woman.\nStanding in the yak-fleece scarf section\nwatching shop assistants stare down fourteen\nyear old tie dye burglars, I realised for the first\ntime that in this arena, our paths diverged to\nsome significant degree. An explanation was\nrequired, and that little piece of Hercule Poirot\nthat occupies some tiny corner of us all\ndef rocked and waxed his mustache.\nIt was not a wind up, she was doing far too\nwell. Sardonism (particularly in poetry I recall)\nwas not her strong suit. Neither was economics\nto blame, she never went out and her rent was\ncheap. It had to be some anti-po session is t socioeconomic statement that was going way over my\nhead.\nMy Paul Smith coat (which I had gone hungry for three months to buy) was now glowing\nscarlet as a hot poker, showing me up to be the\nrich possession is t Nazi that deep down inside I always knew I was. \"Baby Killer! Baby Killer!\"\nI could see the hate behind her eyes. It was like\nwalking down the Falls Road whistling God\nSave the Queen.\nMy guilt was thankfully dispelled several\ndays later when she christened one of my best\nfriends 'Jumper Man'. The relief was blissful.\nActually, 'Sharing eternal damnation down on\nthe seventh level with Judas Iscariot and Claus\nBarbie' would have eased John McCarthy's torpid little volume off the hostage biography bestseller spot with the style and grace of Lord\nTebbit onto any recently privatised company's board of directors. The real relief therefore was\nthat she was as least as big a style fascist as the\nrest of us and worse, that she shopped at Top\nMan because she thought the clothes were worth\nbuying.\nStill, a girl as pretty as Alison could look reasonable in anything. And I'm certain that flowery dungarees will come back one day...\nGlyph\nUnion Minibus Users' Update\nDuring the Autumn term there was considerable\nmedia attention on the subject of minibus a cci dents. As a result of this, the ICU minibuses\nhave come under close scrutiny. Meetings have\ntaken place between ICU and the Director of the\nSafety Unit, Pro-Rector, and other senior\nCollege staff. ICU in the future will be purchasing 16 seat minibuses instead of the 13 and 17\nseat minibuses we have at present. These will\nhave forward facing seats and two small benches\nat the back with cloth trim and seat belts.\nMinibuses will have the Imperial College\nStudents' Union and College crest on either side.\nWe will aim to keep minibuses looking smart.\nPast experience has taught us that we need a tightening up of our policy on damage claims.\nWe will invoice persons responsible for damage\nand expect prompt payment so that minibuses\ncan be repaired. Any damage that you notice\nshould be reported immediately.\nFailure to report damage that has occurred\nduring rental period could lead to a life ban on\ndriving the minibuses. Last year, one minibus\nhad its steering badly damaged. This could have\nled to a serious accident. It was not reported by\nthe person responsible and was only noticed two\nhours before the minibus was due to go abroad.\nAny minibus that has been damaged must not be\nused until it has been inspected by the Transport\nOfficer or a Sabbatical.\nLast December, two members of the Union\nattended courses on Driver Assessment &\nTraining, Fire & Evacuation, Minibuses & The\nLaw. As a result of this and discussions with the\nDirector of the Safety Unit, we have decided that\nas of the delivery of the new minibus we will be\noperating a NO SMOKING policy in all the\nminibuses. We have also changed the format of\nthe minibus driver assessment (a.k.a. the van\ntest), making it slightly longer.\nPlease tell us if and what you use from the\nfirst aid kits (you will not be charged) so that we\ncan keep them topped up.\nICU minibuses are all operated under 'small\nbus permits'. This means that we are able to\ncharge for usage. It also means that we have to\nobey certain regulations, such as The Road\nVehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 No. 1796,\nwhich states that if a minibus is parked on the\npublic highway (i.e. not applicable when on\ncampus, private drive, in a field etc) between\nsunset and sunrise the sidelights must be left on\n(not the interior light, which seems to be the\ncraze at the moment).

Apparently, this is the only\naspect that all film reviewers have been waiting\nin eager anticipation to see. Williams does\nindeed perform 'brilliantly', but that doesn't really tell you much about the film.\nThe film starts with the breakup of two par-ents: the impulsive, irresponsible father\n(Williams) and the precise career-woman mother\n(Field). Due to the father's unreliability, the\ncourt awards custody of the three kids to the\nmother. Williams, unable to face being separated\nfrom his kids, dresses as an old Scottish lady and\ngets a job as the children's new nanny, Mrs\n'Doot-fire'. Apart from just dressing in drag he\nperforms this incredible transformation with the\naid of his brother, the make-up artist (convenient\nI know, but this is Hollywood).\nThe resulting make-over is spectacular and\nyou easily find yourself forgetting that this\nnanny is actually the kids' father. I was a little\nsceptical before the film started as to how any\nkid wouldn't be able to recognise their own\nfather, even if dressed up, but the transformation\nis so good you can believe it with ease.\niiii iii HEAVEN EARTH Le Ly is blindfolded and led away\nAs you would expect, the comedy is rich and\ncentred predominantly around Williams. Gags\nare sharp and the ideas fresh. However, the film\ncould not have worked without a strong support;\nSally Field is great as the wife and her woman-to-woman chats with the nanny are a joy not to\nbe missed. The kids are also a boon to the film,\nall realistically showing their grievances at the\nparent's separation. The best of the three is the\nStarring: Hiep Thi Le, Tommy Lee Jones\nDirector: Oliver Stone\nFilms like Platoon and Bom On The Fourth Of\nJuly have given Oliver Stone a reputation as a bit of a man's man. The portrayal of women in\nhis movies has been at best questionable and at\nworst downright insulting. So cynics had good\nreason for concern when Stone announced his\nfinal Vietnam movie would be told from the\nviewpoint of a native woman. In Heaven and\nEarth, adapted from the true story of Le Ly\nHayslip, the gruff, all-American director gets in\ntouch with his feminine side.\nRural Vietnam, the early Fifties. A young girl\nstands in a paddy field with her parents, the\nlandscape an oasis of calm and beauty. It is a land subjugated for a hundred generations; by\nthe Chinese, the Japanese, and now by the\nFrench. None of this disturbs the continuity of\nthe village, unchanged in a thousand years.\nYoung Le Ly and her siblings have the sort of\nhappiness only appreciated when gone.\nYears pass and Le Ly watches her brothers\ngo off to fight while her village becomes a war\nzone. Her life changes further when she joins the\nVeitCong. She ends up in immoral Saigon where\nshe meets Sgt. Steve Butler. They marry and\nmove to the US, but how well will Le Ly adapt\nto this alien culture?\nyoungest, portraying that blunt simplicity only\nfound in a young child.\nEven without the comedy this is a solid tale\nof a marriage breakup and the effect it can have\non both the parents and the kids. The film's message looked like being a load of sloppy mush\nright up to the last, but salvaged itself with style\nand eloquence to make a real point.\nSphen\nBeautiful and moving, Heaven and Earth is\nthe finest creation of a great film-maker. His\npolitics aside, no-one can fault the visual perfection Stone has created here, handling the philosophical synchronicity of the plot with surprising subtlety (circularity and coming full circle\nare central to the narrative structure).\nThe film suffers from newcomer Hiep Thi\nLe's inexperience and too much time is spent on\nseemingly useless plot development, but the\nstunning performance of Tommy Lee Jones is\nabove any criticism. He, along with the excellent\nJoan Chen and Haing Ngor who play Le Ly's parents, anchor the film and carry into our\nhearts. Tommy Lee Jones seems to get better\nevery time I see him and hopefully this role will\nrealise the full potential of his seemingly limitless talent.\nHeaven and Earth is very much a woman's film in its emotional focus, but this should not\ndeter men. Retelling America's most filmed\nnightmare from the other side provides a vivid\ncontrast to Stone's other two Vietnam films and\nit deserves to be watched as part of a trilogy\nwhich now resonates with the director's new\nmessage: War produces no winners, only vic-tim s. Film students will devote pages to the eerie\nsimilarity of Le Ly and Ron Kovic, which is the\ngreatest tribute Stone could ask for.\nTony\nSchwing!! Wayne's World2 is reviewed next week\n\n"

Looking at the agenda, it looks\nas if it will be as fun-filled and interesting as\never!\nSorry for the touch of sarcasm, but the last\nthree UGMs haven't exactly filled me with a burning desire to go to this one. I 've spent the\nlast term trying to be as enthusiastic about them\nas possible to as many people as possible, but I can only do so much. It's important that everyone goes along to them because they need to\nknow what's been going on in the Union. But\nwhat happens when you get people to go and the\nmeeting is as uninspiring as the last few? In\nshort, they don't bother coming again.\nCan it be that difficult to make them a bit\nmore interesting? The U GM that sticks in my\nmind was the one where the Third World First\nSociety put forward a motion to boycott Nestle\nproducts within the Union. They succeeded and\nit became policy for the Union and any of its\ntrading outlets (Bar, Da Vinci' s and the\nBookstore) not to buy any Nestle products for\nthe next three years. This may seem boring to\nyou, but it prompted discussions and people\ncould actually see the that their decisions had\nchanged the way the Union did things.\nThey could even be made fun (perish the\nthought!). A couple of years ago, a motion was\nproposed which, if passed, would have meant\nthat the sabbaticals would have had to wear\nThunderbirds costumes. Unfortunately, it never\ngot as far as being discussed because someone\ncalled 'Quorum', but it sparked off interest in\nthe U GM and people were actually turning up to\nit. I can't see the same level of interest being\ngenerated by a load of reports or a discussion\nabout a new constitution.\nBut maybe the presentation on Student\nRepresentative Councils (SRCs) will spark off\nsome debate. As far as I can make out (and I could be wrong), the idea is to replace UGMs\nwith a smaller body of students. The last time\nanyone tried to do away with UGMs, the JCR\nwas packed with people opposing it. It would be\ngood to see a similar sort of response if this idea\nfor SRCs goes any further than the presentation\ntoday.\nBut enough ranting about the Union (I 've had\nenough people calling me a 'hack' recently). On\na much lighter note, the 1000th edition of Felix\nis looming ever closer. It is due to come out on\nFriday 13th May. Sounds fated already, doesn't it?! Hopefully, it will be a commemorative issue\nof some description, but we are open to suggestions. If you have any ideas of what form it\ncould take or what articles you would like to see\nin it, let us know.\nAnother piece of advanced warning: We are\nplanning a travel special for March, so any articles on travel or work abroad or in this country\nwill be gratefully received.\nLetters To Felix\nYou must show your Union card\nwhen submitting a letter to be\nprinted in Felix. Unless this has been\nchecked, the letter will not be printed.\nNames will only be withheld from\nletters under extreme circumstances.\n2)\n9H6A reminder that the\nValentine Edition\nof Felix will be\ncoming out on 11th February.\nYou can send a message to the love (or\nhate) of your life free\nof charge through\nFelix. Just make\nsure they are put\ninto the Valentine\npigeonhole in the\nFelix Office by 4th February.\nBAN/ AMIMAL if e PAPK KNIGHT'S5m11 "

The minibus had been\nwritten off and so its ownership had\nreverted to the insurers.\nThe insurance company sold the\nremains of the van to a salvage mer-chant. According to Kent CID, it\nwas then sold at auction to a buyer\nwho gave false details.\nUnfortunately, these subsequent\nowners of the van failed to register\ntheir purchase with the authorities,\nso officials could only trace it to the\nUnion.\nThe damage to the minibus\ncaused by the accident over the\nsummer was extensive. It is said\nthat the only part left undamaged\nwas the foot plate at the back. It\nseems most probable that the incident involved another vehicle using\nthe registration plates of the writ-ten-off minibus.\nSt. Mary's Retirement\nA formal apology has been given to\nBrian Lloyd Davies by the Felix\nNews Team.\nIn a story last week we incorrectly stated that Mr Lloyd Davies\nhad resigned from his post as the\nSecretary to the Delegacy at St\nMary's Hospital Medical School.\nHe had in fact retired.\nIn a letter to Felix, Mr Lloyd\nDavies outlined the main points of\nhis speech which we had incorrectly\nprinted. Mr Lloyd Davies said that\nlast week's article was \"such a travesty of the truth\" that he felt forced\nto write the letter to \"put the record\nstraight\".\nIn his farewell speech he included criticism of the 'administration',\nreferring to the \"second rate\nGovernment\" and not the College\nas reported. Mr Lloyd Davies commented \"I mentioned in particular\nthe Government's petty and censor-i al proposals for reform of Student\nUnions contained in the new\nEducation Bill.\"\nAs copies of the speech were\nunavailable at the time, the article\nwas based almost entirely upon\ninformal interviews with members\nof College staff.\nThe reporter responsible\nexpressed regret that the facts of the\nstory were not checked.\nTube\nPenalties\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nLondon Underground is planning to\nintroduce Penalty Fares of \u00a310 in\norder to combat fare-dodging. The\ncompany has estimated that it loses\nup to \u00a330 million a year to the\ncheats.\nIf approved by the Government,\nthe penalties would come into\neffect from 3rd April 1994.

    "content": "Feature 7\nthe clock until it's time to start again.\nThat's the down side of being a Crisis\nVolunteer. The up side is much greater, far\nlonger lasting and often wrapped in some very\nhumourous situations. One night, I was on the\ngate greeting the incoming guests. The rules of\nthe Open Christmas are simple: no drink, no\ndrugs, no weapons and no\npets are to be brought\nonto the site. The vast\nmajority of guests stick to\nthese rules. Because a very tiny minority don't, the gatekeeper s have to\nfrisk visitors which, for\ndiplomatic reasons, is\nbest done by women.\nOne night, we turned a bottle of scotch out of\none guy's pockets and a lively discussion ensued\nin which we had to tell the unfortunate fellow\nthat he couldn't bring it inside with him.\nWorried that it would be swiped if he hid it\noutside, he asked us to mind it. We couldn't. Volunteers can't look after guest's possessions,\nbecause they're regularly moved between jobs,\nso a temporary stalemate was reached - until the\nguest sorted the problem out for us.\nRealising that he could not get in with the\nscotch ON him, but that he could with it IN him,\nhe promptly unscrewed the cap and sank the lot\nin one go! As soon as the last drop had slid\ndown his throat, he tottered through the gate in\ntriumph, leaving me holding the empty bottle!\nThen, there was the guest who was last to\nleave on the final day. This was a'sh outer', a harmless old soul who barked unintelligible\nabuse at any Volunteer who went near him.\n'Shouters' are rarely violent, but kid gloves and\na bit of inspiration are needed to deal with them.\nEnter Ted, a great, bearded bear of a Volunteer\nand a fine actor. \"Don't look at him, just leave\nhim to me,\" he told the knot of Volunteers who\nwere gathering around.\nApproaching the man, he got the same abuse\nas all the rest. So, adopting the same crouched\npose as the man, he simply mirrored his gestures\nand shouted abuse back at him. It worked a treat.\nWithin a few minutes, Volunteer and Guest hobbled out the door, each trying to out-eff and out-blind the other!\nA nigh club bouncer could learn much from\nthe way that Crisis staff handle the occasional\npunch-ups, which, it must be stressed, are no\nmore frequent than those that might take place in\nany other 24-hour club with several hundred\ncustomers. Brawn counts for little when dealing\nwith a fight that might be taking place between a drunk oblivious to pain and a mental patient\nwho's inner turmoil keeps him fighting long\nafter a sane person would stop. In those c irc um stances, brain power wins every time.\nIf one cannot talk about the guests' problems,\nwhat about their personalities? The media and\nthe pundits may have their own views on the\nsubject, but the best general description I 've ever\nheard came from a guest during the wee small\nhours of a night shift. He was a true 'knight of\nthe road' who admitted that, after twenty years\nof living out of a gunnysack as a merchant\n'Care in the\nCommunity' is proof\nthat this government\nreally does have a sense of humour sailor, he could not live in a home, even if he\nwas offered Buckingham Palace.\nThere were, he surmised, three types of\nCrisis guest. The first was the 'temporarily\ndown on their luck' ones. My first year at Crisis\ncoincided with the recession beginning to bite in\nthe building game and a good number of guests\nwere c hippies, spark ies and brick ies highly\nskilled craftsmen, who'd enjoyed past good times\nbut were now suffering.\nThe next type were\nones like himself: drifters\nand wanderers, those with\nan ingrained urge to keep\nmoving. In many respects\nthe drifters are the most\ninteresting of the lot.\nThey tell some wonderfully funny stories about\nthe people who have given them lifts over the\nyears and have in their heads a knowledge of\nBritain's road network\ntoo vast to ever put onto\na computer.\nThe final type are the\nsaddest of all: the alcoholics, drug addicts and\nthe mentally ill. The drug\naddicts and drinkers can\nonly be helped when they decide to help them-selves. The mentally ill though are a different\nstory.\nThey have fallen through the gossamer thin\nnet that the government insulting ly calls 'Care In\nThe Community'. I once used to work for a top\nTory and my political sympathies still lie vaguely in that direction. That said, while working at\nCrisis I 've seen enough to realise that 'Care in\nthe Community' is proof positive that this government really does have a sense of humour.\nActually, it's not a very funny policy, it's simply\nThere were, he\nsurmised, three types\nof Crisis guest...\na ridiculous one. It does not work at all and\nneeds to be reversed el pronto.\nIf that sums up the guests, what sums up the\nvolunteers? Is it their occupations? Not really,\nfor one could stop a hundred people at random\nin Oxford Street and find the same job descriptions among a Similar number of Crisis\nVolunteers. Is it their religion? No again,\nbecause for everyone who thinks they're there\ndoing God's work, there is another who does not\ngive a damn for faith of any kind. They all do it\nfor different reasons which, for the most part,\nthey prefer to keep to themselves.\nWhen I get back to work, the inevitable stories about the Christmases of my work mates will\nstart doing the rounds. No doubt people will ask\nme what I did in my holiday. It will be easy to\ntell them but difficult to explain the emotions\nbehind it. This year, as my last shift came to an\nend, I was standing in the middle of the hall,\nrecalling the time two Christmases ago, when I'd stood in the place spot and heard the strains of a guitar coming from a corner of the hall.\nMoving closer, I listened for a while to the\nsound of Ralph McTell's song, 'The Streets of\nLondon', being sung by\nthe very people it was\nabout. Coming back to the present, I paused long\nenough to give a belated Christmas gift of a woolly hat I'd worn all week to the fourteen\nyear-old homeless girl with enough personality\nto fill a tower block. She'd set her heart on it.\nThen I left, hoping that the sticking plasters I'd managed to apply to the wounded souls of some\nof the people I'd met this year would stay intact\nlong enough to do some good.\nOur thanks to Deborah Pack at Crisis for the\nprovision of the photographs.\nPhoto: Andrew Johnston\nWitches, satanists, yuppies - Mysteries sees them all on page 5\n\n"
