    "content": "Certificate A Starring Henry Fonda,\nKatherine Hepburn, Jane Fonda Directed\nby Mike Terry. Now showing at Odeon\nHaymarket.\nThe prospect of a film starring two\nHollywood veterans about the generation gap i and old age is superficially not very interesting.\nBut when it turns into a beautifully crafted\nblack comedy its appeal is greatly magnified.\nOn Go/den Pond is sentimental and\nunashamedly so; Henry Fonda plays Norman\nThayer a retired professor approaching hi?\neightieth birthday who returns to his usu;\nsummer retreat, Golden Pond, with his w: Ethel (Katherine Hepburn). They dust off th\ncabin and are soon joined by daughter Chels\n(Jane Fonda) and her boyfriend Bill Ray. Th\n.deposit thirteen-year-old son Billy who is left\ndeal with the crochet y Norman while his fath\nand Chelsea take a trip to Europe.\nHenry Fonda gives a genuinely brill i a: performance as Norman Thayer. The old ma\nis stubborn, offensive and has a great line i. abuse. He jokes continually about death and is\nbitter and cynical about everything (including\nhis daughter) until he encounters Billy. The\ntwo grow to respect each other and the\ngeneration gap is seen to be bridged by a mutual respect for their differences.\nThe film has been nominated for ten Oscars,\nincluding Best Picture, Best Actor, Best\nActress and Best Supporting Actress. In my\nbook it certainly rates above REDS tor best\npicture and I feel that to deny Henry Fonda\nBest Actor would be a crime; he fully deserves\nit, despite having been awarded an Honorary\nOscar only last year. Katherine Hepburn\nwarbles her way through the picture and Jane\nFonda supports adequately, but I doubt if they\nwill win awards.\nThis is the film that should sweep the awards\nceremony though\u2014don't miss it!\nMad Max 2 Certificate X Starring Mel\nGibson Directed by George Miller.\nA film that in its weil ding of violent, sexual\nimagery underlay ed with crude wit and a refutation of charm is a culmination of\ntwentieth century paranoia.\nMax shares a post-nuclear war Austalian\noutback with other motorised eccentrics\nagainst whom he continuously pits himself,\njustifying his killing with some hopelessly\noutdated illusions of 'justice'. Max is the\nindividual against an arbitrary barbarian horde,\na god-head to himself in a godless scenario, a weight he and his bike seem fully committed to\nbear.\nBoth plot and characters are sustained by\naction which of itself raises questions which\nthe characters never confront leaving them\nembedded disturbingly in the body of the film.\nAll individual characters except Max and his\nfaithful dog are ultimately dispensable in form,\nwith Max's mad, violent vision, derived from\npre-holocaust assumptions, requiring only the\noccur ance of character to construe action.\nMax eventually ends up defending a type of\ncity state which has sprung up around an oil\nwell in the irradiated out lands, oil, in the age of\ndegenerating mechanism, being the most sort-after asset, and which provides, for Max, a mitigating circumstance, of sorts, for the\nensuing slaughter as he decimates the\nhallucinogenic assortment of bikes, ranging\nfrom the strangely punk-like, mohicans and\nbondage, to stylised gladiators, who are laying\nsiege.\nA technically accomplished, trash film\nwhich, if you can stomach the descent into\nviolence, fills an evening.\nMany of you will, no doubt, be familiar with\nSimon Bond's best selling book 101 Uses of a Dead Cat, which brought its author overnight\nfame and a series of abusive complaints from\ncat lovers the world over.\nHis latest collection Unspeakable Acts\ncontinues much in the same vein. In this case\nwe are subjected to some of the blacker areas\nof human temptation\u2014convicts use the body\nof a dying prisoner as a punch bag, and\ngrandpa gets a box of Havana cigars for\nChristmas, despite his oxygen mask. People\nperform all sorts of dastardly deeds, ranging\nfrom a doctor's sneaking temptation to chill his\nstethoscope in an ice-bucket to a Romeo\npeering up Juliet's skirt on the balcony.\nThe criticisms of the book are simple; I find\nBond's style of drawing shows little variation or\nimagination, half the ideas are very good and\nthe others are very bad (with none in-between)\nand the book seems over-priced.\nThere are certainly some clever and funny\n'sick' jokes included, which fans of 101 Uses\nwill enjoy. But I doubt whether this book will\nadd to Mr Bond's present following.\nMark Smith\nMost sequels seems to be poor imitations of the original, intended to cash in on their original\nsuccess. Halloween II (X, Warner, Classic, Studio) is an exception. The action takes up\nwhere Halloween left off; the monstrous shape rises from the dead and pursues Laurie (Jamie\nLee Curtis) to Haddonfield Hospital where he despatches his victims in cold and gruesome\nstyle. By acting as a continuation rather than a sequel and retaining the simplicity of the\noriginal Rick Rosenthal has produced an effective and entertaining shocker. Halloween has a lot to answer for in that it started a flood of imitations, but it was undoubtedly an unusual film\nwhose appeal has not been matched until Halloween II came along.\nIf you haven't seen Halloween it's a little pointless starting with Halloween II. If you have,\ndon't pass up the chance for \" more of the night he came home\".\nPage 10 FELIX, March 12, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Mark'\nWhile I share Graeme Shaw' s detestation of the\napartheid system, his call for a total boycott of South African\nproducts is unrealistic. The unpleasant fact is that we are\ntotally dependant on South\nAfrica for essential minerals\nlike tungsten, vanadium, gold, platinum, and heavily\ndependant also for chrome,\nnick le and industrial diamonds. A total boycott of S. African goods would mean no\nlight bulbs, masonry drills,\nwedding rings, printed circuits, stainless steel, car batteries, petrol and many\nother industrial products. The\nonly alternative suppliers of\nmany essential minerals are in\nthe Soviet Bloc, and I don't think much of their social\nsystem either. I would support\nan urgent programme to\nprospect and develop alternative free world supplies of\nessential raw materials we\ncurrently import from South\nAfrica, but until that happens\ntalk of a total boycott is\nnonsense.\nWe can in the meantime\nconcentrate on improvements\nthat are possible, by pressing\nBritish companies working in\nSouth Africa to increase black\nwage rates, open 'reserved'\noccupations to black workers,\nde-segregate works facilities,\nand help black workers with\ngrants for house purchase and\nthe education of their children. British companies in\nSouth Africa are sensitive to\nthese issues and are moving to\ncounter the effects of apartheid as far as they can.\nOf course this is not enough,\nand we should support the\nblack South African's struggle\nfor political freedom by sporting and cultural boy-cot ts, and by discouraging\nskilled tradesmen from emigrating to South Africa and\ntaking jobs that would otherwise be made available to\nblacks. But unless we are\nprepared to wreck our economy totally\u2014and I don't think any political party will\nget a mandate for that\u2014a call\nfor a total economic boycott is\nan unrealistic gesture which\nmay ease some consciences,\nbut will do nothing to improve\nthe actual conditions for\nSouth African blacks.\nTours sincerely\nDavid Ashforth\nChaplain\nDear Sir\nI am totally disgusted with\nthe way the cricket tour to\nSouth Africa has been handled.

Wells\nSociety that due to the industrious efforts of our beloved leader, Mr Pallab\nGhosh, a couple of deliberate\nerrors accidentally cropped\nup in the new edition of The\nWellsian. The first was a simple and unfortunate premeditated oversight, in that\nmy name was somehow omitted from the article. While I totally deny all knowledge of\nthe final paragraph, the remainder was actually written by me. The last paragraph\nwas just an added bonus\nwhich The Almighty, decided\nto bestow upon us.\nThe second error was a spelling mistake in the last\nparagraph, in which the word\n\" shit\" was for some yet unexplained reason spelt\n\" chairman\".( Palla b was\nawarded this sacred title some\ntwo committee meetings ago.)\nI realise of course that most\nof our members worship Mr Ghosh on b ended knees.

    "content": "Cross Country\nThe National Cross Country Championships\nwere held last Saturday in Leeds, and a group of IC runners took the specially chartered train to attend the event. Although\nit was a fine and clear day in London, in Leeds a strong wind blew with a light rain\naccompaniment.\nTeam quality was marred significantly by\nthe fact that most, if not all, of our best\nrunners are injured in one way or another at\npresent.\nThis then is the excuse for our junior team\ncomprising J. Frost, R. Morrison, E. Jones\nand A.

Having everyone for miles around you drunk, when\nyou have got to go and play hockey does no\ngood to the nerves. My friend's nerves were\nfurther jangled when Richmond scored twice\nwithin the first ten minutes, with the added\nstress of playing on an all-weather pitch, he\nand his team-mates did well to keep playing.\nEventually goals from Simon Witter and\nSimon Gray levelled the scores, only for\nRichmond to score the winner very near the\nend.

They worked well with a team showing a number of changes. The second row combined well in the tight to\nproduce some good possession in often\ndifficult circumstances and Mark Johsnon\nwas especially vigorous in the loose.\nThe first try came from J. Paixao after fine\nplay from the backs with Chapman actually\nmoving the ball. Reading replied with a penalty late in the first half after the solid\nImperial defence held up against persistent\npressure.\nPlaying with the wind in the second half,\nthere was some excellent tactical kicking\nfrom Boucher at fly half and constant attacking produced two tries. One was by\nHudson who later converted Pike's which\nwas under the posts. More points should have\nbeen scored by Imperial who were encamped\nin the Reading half for the remainder of the\nmatch.\nTeam: /. Magnus, M. Winsor, G. Pike, W. Chapman, 0. Miles, J. Boucher, J. Paixao, J. Hulton, C. Cola, S. Bell, M. Jackson, ./V. Welham, F.O 'Connor, M. Hudson, P. Hughes.harborough.\n&Water Polo\nLast Saturday IC Water Polo team took on\nOxford University in an interesting match\nwhich was characterised by excessive verbal\nand physical violence.\nThe match started badly for IC, and matters were not helped by the fact that Last\nand Ashwin were both still suffering from a lunchtime session. We went 4-1 down after\ntwo quarters, despite some good play by\nBurnett in goal; our only goal was a penalty\nfrom Leach, Carton as usual not keeping\nhis cool very successfully, was sent out yet\nagain, for the fourth match running, and Ashwin was involved in a brief slang ing match with an opposition player.\nThe last two quarters went rather better,\nas our two drunks sobered up and our attack\nbecame be lter organised. Boucher started a light in the shallow end, just to keep the\nmatch lively, and shortly after that our second goal was put in by Last while Leach\nrestrained the man marking him. However, our improvement was not enough to make a lull comeback, and the\ngame ended as a disappointing 6-2 defeat for\nIC.\nFootball\nOn a windy spring afternoon the First XI strode boldly onto the pitch, accompanied by\nthose nice quiet boys from Goldsmiths.\nAs per usual IC lost the toss and consequently kicked off, the whistle being\ndrowned by the raucous, mainly drunken\nGoldsmiths supporters. A frantic start to the\nmatch was well illustrated by Reeve's blatant, but entertaining tackle/foul.\nAfter ten minutes, Goldsmiths opened the\nscoring, with a be a uti lully ll u ent move from\nIC. Lay hit a screaming forty yard ball to\nNiccolls who completely miss-hit it to Reeve,\nwho promptly finished, lobbing the mouse-like Aled Williams.\nThe game continued from crunching tackle to stiff talking to from the ref to even\nmore crunching tackle. The worst/ best example was the late-ish tackle on Steve\nWard, the IC Captain, by a Goldsmiths\nforward, which resulted in him getting a stiff\nleft-hook from said captain!\nHowever, minutes later his revenge was\nsweet. Dunhill turned the ball back to the\nedge of the Goldsmiths penalty area where\nWard had beat the advancing defence.\nInstant control and a cool clinical lob left the\ngoalkeeper stranded with Ward racing away\nto acknowledge the adulation(?) of the\nGoldsmiths crowd.\nAs the final seconds of normal time ticked\naway, Williams was twice called upon to\nmake cat-like saves to keep the scores level.\nThe final whistle blew, heralding extra-time..\nDuring the first half of extra time IC began\nto dominate. This was helped by the opposition falling down like flies with cramp.\nIC finally reaped the reward of their efforts as\nRickard thundered the ball into the net. The second half saw 'controlled' defence by IC, as\nSteve Ward cleared the ball out of the\nstadium. The final whistle brought ecstatic\nscenes as the nearly hoarse supporters joined\nthe team in the celebrations that continued\nlate into the night. The whole team would\nlike to thank all the supporters who helped to\nsend them on their way. i Team: A. Williams, J. Lay, S. Dunhill, K. Reeve, S. Ward, A. Page, P.. Niccolls, D. FAsby,\nM. Carr, D.

As the\nday broke IC Seconds turned up at the\nUnion Lower Lounge attired in an assortment of dinner suits, Hawaiian shirts\nand knee length jeans. We arrived at\nMotspur Park just after 10:15am. Then we kicked off (after Ron lost toss),\nkicking uphill against wind. They looked\nquite big, but we soon cut them down to size,\nalter stringing a lew passes together, we took-the lead with a disputed goal (through Steve\nRimmer) against the run of play. Soon after\nJohn Burns slotted another, and after a wind\nassisted QM C goal half-time arrived with\nthe score 2-1 in IC's favour. The second half\nstarted very slowly, with QM C III giving as\ngood as they got until Andy Hartland scored\nhis first, this was soon followed by a rare\nheader (by Rimmer) into the back of the net\n(from a John Burns throw in). Then Hartland scored his second, Veen man went\noff to be replaced by Flanagan and we won 5-1.\nTeam: Veals, Burns, Beer, Griffiths, Curran,\nArmstrong, Saunders, Wiggins, Rimmer,\nHartland, Veenman.

    "content": "The King (David Dixon) imprisoned in The Tower in Brecht's Edward II.\nEdward II by Bertolt Brecht (after\nMarlowe). Presented by Foco Novo\nTheatre Company and directed by Rees\nat the Round House Theatre.\nThe Round House, London's unique Victorian\nengine shed, built by Robert Louis Stephenson\nin 1847, and which serves as a bold and\nimaginative centre for theatre, visual arts,\nmusic and dance, is the venue for Brecht's Edward II. The play is one of Brecht's earliest,\ncoming soon after his first play Baal which was\npresented by the BBC last week with\nDavid Bowie in the title role. Baal was written\nin an incredible four days when he was a student of natural sciences at university.\nBrecht re-examines Marlowe' s story\n(Marlowe was Shakespeare's most important\npredecessor) and in place of dignified royal and\naristocratic figures he presents men of naked\nand brutal ambition. Marlowe's chronicle is\nturned into a ballad singer's chronicle play\nwhich is swept along by rough, robust and\nvigorous verse. The chronicle relates how\nEdward (played by David Dixon), and his\nhomosexual infatuation with his 'favourite'\nGaveston, causes him to abandon his wife and\nkingdom and take up arms with the barons.\nThe most fascinating character in the work is\nMortimer (played superbly by Ian Hogg).\nBrecht electrifying ly transforms him from a The Collected Essays, Journalism and\nLetters of George Orwell, Volume 3 'As I Please' 1943-45, Penguin \u00a33.95.\nNearly all great writers are boring. If you try\nthe big names like Dickens, Dostoevsky,\nTolstoy, Chekov, Kafka, Solzhenitsyn and so\non, you H find long stretches that are very\nheavy going. (From the point of view of getting\nrecognition from the literary establishment,\nbeing boring is probably an advantage for a writer. Then the academics who decide to like\nhim can feel that they're a select few.)\nBut even the blurb on the cover is an under\nstatement when it comes to George Orwell.\nHe wasn't only a brilliant writer in the technical\nsense, but he also took a completely different\napproach from the one writers usually took in\nthe thirties and forties. That is, he didn't ignore\nawkward facts and he tried to make his\nopinions fit the facts rather than the other way\nround. He didn't accept the widely held\ndoctrine that the end justifies the means, and\nthroughout his writings there's an atmosphere\nof fair mindedness, a willingness to look at\nboth sides of the argument.\ncontemplative man of letters to a cunning man\nof war who becomes instrumental in bringing\nabout the arrest, imprisonment and torture of\nthe King.\nThe Round House's production is tremendously appealing to the senses. The coronation\nof Edward II in the opening scene is\naccompanied by the swinging incense burners\nand the mellifluous flow of a Gregorian chant.\nThe numerous brief interludes are filled with\nthe frenzied beating of drums which signal a kind of relentless war-cry and in the enclosed\nOrwell wasn't afraid to discuss awkward\nquestions (the conservation of the working\nclass, reprisals against German PoWs, the\nshow trials, etc.) no matter how frowned on it\nwas by the prevailing orthodoxy. What's more,\nhe spent a lot of his time attacking the Left,\neven though he was himself a socialist,\nbecause their conduct frequently disgusted\nhim; \"....they think entirely in terms of power\npolitics and competitive prestige. In looking at\nany situation they do not say 'What are the\nfacts? What are the probabilities?' but 'How\ncan I make it appear to myself and others that\nmy faction is getting the better of some rival\nfaction?'\" This is the sort of writing that made\nhim unpopular with people who were nominally his allies but whose outlook was\ncompletely different.\nOrwell wrote some of his most effective\nwork when he was trying to discredit the\ntotalitarian' realistic' inclinations of the\nintelligentsia but it has to be said that when he\ntried making original, practical suggestions he\nwas sometimes pretty silly. \"....(A) national\naccent \u2014 a modification of cockney, perhaps,\nor one of the northern accents \u2014 should be\ntaught as a matter of course to all children\nalike.\"\nAbout three quarters of this collection is\nmade up of the regular articles called 'As I Please' which Orwell wrote for Tribune while\nhe was its literary editor. Letters, book reviews, articles for newspapers and some\nlong essays make up the rest. Apart from the\npolitical essays there's an enormous range of\nwhat you might call cultural pieces with\nsubjects going from how to make a perfect cup\nof tea to the un at tra et ive ness of the UK as a tourist resort. The style is always very readable and clear and as the blurb says\nGeorge Orwell \"possessed an unerring gift for\ngoing straight to the point\". This is one of the\nbest books in the English Language and 1 can't recommend it (and the other three volumes,\nand the rest ot Orwell's books) too highly.\nN. Willson\nFELIX.

Male weakness is shown in every\npossible guise from repressed homosexuality\nand impotence to cuckold ry and open violence.\nMartin Howells plays Kevin, the apparently\nradical club treasurer who proposes that\nwomen be admitted to the clubhouse, whilst\ncunningly manipulating the rest of the\ncommittee( comprising Rory Hale as Secretary, Michael Hughes as Chairman, and\nChristopher Barr as Captain) to his own ends,\nby exploiting their naivety, weaknesses and\nblunders.\nDespite this total lack of any worthy male\nattributes this is not a feminist play as such.\nWomen are represented by Arbel Jones as a professional stripper, and the Chairman's wife\n(played by Susie Johns) who has apparently\n\"had so many men through her that they were\nthinking of naming a turnstile at Cardiff Arms Park after her.\"\nI would recommend this play as light\nentertainment for an evening out. Regardless\nof the ticket discount for members of rugby\nclubs, as well as students, it is not necessary to\nunderstand or appreciate the game in order to\ni enjoy this production, which continues until\nearly April.\n| Nick Hill\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "The arts, and\nscience\nand technology\nby N. Willson\nWhen the teaching of technology was\nexpanded in the sixties, an entire new system\nwas created for it\u2014the polytechnics. The idea\nseemed to be that universities mustn't be\nassociated with too much science and\ntechnology, that the creation of technical\nuniversities would be somehow wrong, as if the\nvery term 'technical university' is a contra-diction, like 'open prison'. The whole idea of a university education goes with the arts\nrather than the sciences, especially\nengineering. You can have a university without\nscience and technology but not one without\nthe arts.\nWhy do the arts (especially history and\nliterature) tend to be more attractive to an\nacademic mind? To start with, the arts are\neasier subjects to study; arts students don't have to do so much work. Of course it's easy\nto be biased about this at IC, but not many arts\nstudents could seriously complain of being\noverworked compared with us. But in any case\nthe amount of work involved isn't very\nimportant\u2014look how popular medical courses\nare.\nWhat's much more important is the fact that\nscience and engineering are useful. Why\nshould usefulness put people off? It isn't true of\ncourse that it always does; doctors are useful\nand they're highly respected. But in general\nluxuries are more interesting than necessities.\nA painting of a landscape is more interesting\nthan a textbook about soil mechanics. And\nart j sts can only preserve their work because\nsomeone else is learning about soil mechanics.\nAn academic sitting in a library making notes\non the significance of prefixes in Sanskrit\nphilosophical terminology (I haven't made this\nup) can only do this pleasant work because\nother people who went to IC (or somewhere)\nto study technology have supplied him with the\ntable, the chair, the pen, the building and the\ntransport to bring him the food he eats. An\nartist benefits from the work of technologists,\nbut they don't benefit from his, except in such\na way that the artist can think of himself as\nenlightening them. He can plausibly regard his\nwork, or rather the work of artists in general,\nas the real aim of civilisation, its best and\nhighest purpose. The technologists do the\ndrudgery work while the artists are creative.\nLook at it from another angle. Technical\ncourses (science as well as engineering) are\nseen as beneficial almost entirely for utilitarian\ncommercial reasons. We need engineers and\nscientists, so it's thought, because the UK\nneeds to make cars and record players better\nthan the Japanese. We don't need technology\nfor any enlightening reasons, but because it's good for our balance of payments. Naturally it\ndoesn't do to put it as crudely as that, so\npoliticians and some organisations (such as the\nIndustrial Society) try to dress it up a bit. But it\ncomes across clearly enough to anyone who's at all intellectually inclined, like an arts student.\n(Why does IC have a department of\nhumanities? It's mainly because of intellectual\nsnobbery and it's tied up with the reasons\noutlined above. You come to IC to learn about\namplifiers or rolling mills, so as to get a degree,\na sort of job voucher entitling you to work for\nRTZ or the Chemical Defence Establishment\nIt doesn't fit in with the idea of a College being\na seat of learning for its own sake. So the\nhumanities department has been added as a kind of cosmetic to make IC look more\nhighbrow than it really is).\nEasily the most important reason why\npeople prefer art subjects to science\nenormous d it terence in the scope of the\nsubjects studied by artists and scientists. It's the difference between the workings of an\nelectric motor and the workings of history. An\nartist considers the significance of the Russian\nrevolution or the novels of Swift while a scientist studies thermostats or bile secretion.\nThe artist can think of big, dramatic issues\nwhile we usually study very specialised\nsubjects. (That's why an artist's work is often a scientist's pleasure\u2014like reading or painting\u2014\nbut rarely the other way around.) This means\nthere's a great difference in the outlook\nexpected of artists and scientists. Most of what\nwe have to learn at IC are routine skills\u2014how\nto use an oscilloscope, how to solve a type of\nequation, how to dissect rats. All you're\nexpected to do is learn what the method is so\nthat you can apply it when you have to, semi-automatically, practically without thinking. But\nan artist doesn't push buttons on a calculator\naccording to a formula in front of him, he can\nchallenge the accepted wisdom and choose\nbetween competing schools of thought. In the\narts you're expected to think for yourself\nmuch more than you are in science and\ntechnology.\nWhat about engineers and scientists? What\ndo they think about the arts? By and large, the\nattitude at IC to the arts, public events,\nmodern history and so on, is a mixture of\napathy, boredom and contempt. There's a vague, semi-instinctive feeling that it's pretentious to be involved in anything\nintellectual or 'arty'. Ask a student here if he's interested in politics (say) and you'll get\nvarious kinds of answers, but rarely will the\nanswer be 'yes'. A lot of people will be hostile\nto the notion that they should interest\nthemselves in current affairs or the arts. The\ngeneral feeling is that the arts are for pratt s. And why not? After all, most people who are\ninterested in the arts are pratt s; they're usually\npretentious, arrogant and self-important (and\nfor the more extreme ones, narrow minded\nand intolerant as well.) (The most repulsive\nfeature of politics in particular is the\natmosphere of dishonesty that surrounds it.\nMost politically-minded people have pre-programmed themselves to accept an\nargument or a fact only if it's favourable to the\nparty line\u2014look at the controversy over\nLondon Transport's fares.) The art and\npolitics, are activities where arrogance and\npretentiousness can flourish. It's probably\nbecause you need hardly any technical skills to\nbecome involved in them. Pseuds will feel\ndrawn towards the arts because they sense\nthat they'll provide a better outlet for their\npretentiousness than (say) operating a milling\nmachine. So any intellectual, non-technical\nactivity tends to be dominated by pratt s \u2014look\nat the House of Commons.\nIt's an uninspiring picture that comes out of\nall this. Artists regard scientists and\ntechnologists as unimaginative, unable to see\nbeyond the ends of their noses, too involved\nwith boring subjects like electricity. Scientists\nand technologists regard artists as pretentious,\nincapable of changing a light bulb, too involved\nwith boring subjects like Bauhaus modernism.\nScience students and arts students look down\non each other, and they both have good\nreasons.\nA play by JP Sartre.\nTranslated by Frank Hauser.\nUnion Concert Hall.\nWed17 to Sat 20 March at 7:30\nTickets \u00a31.00 on the door.\nA Dramsoc production.\nV WU WUV WV WWW WU WW br W^ Not enough time to go to concerts?\nCome to one at College instead!\nConsort Chamber Orchestra\nWednesday, March 17, 1:00pm, Great Hall\nAdmissions free!\nPachelbel: Kanon\nVivaldi: Violin Concerto Op12 No1 Soloist: M.

    "content": "THE PUBLIC O CONNECTION The Pimtico Connection started six years ago when twelve electrical engineering\nstudents went to tutor at Pimlico Comprehensive School (hence the name). Since\nthen, the project has steadily developed, and now the opportunity exists for ninety\npeople to take part, each year, in five different schools.\nWhat is tutoring and why do it?\nTutoring at\nthe schools on\nthis map:-The main purpose of students acting as tutors\nis to provide added interest, help and attention\nfor pupils in the classroom, laboratory or\nworkshop. Since we are closer, both in age\nand outlook, than many of the teachers, and as\nwe are pupils ourselves, it is easier for the kids\nto ask questions and receive much needed\nextra attention.\nIn no way does tutoring involve looking\nafter a class of 20-30 kids on your own. The\nwhole point of tutoring is to provide more\nindividual attention. Usually there is one tutor\nto every four or five pupils in the class and the\nteacher should always be present as s/ he is\nresponsible for discipline and safety.\nTo date, every student who has been a tutor\nhas found it a thoroughly enjoyable and\nstimulating experience. Personally, I feel I have\nlearnt as much as I taught, not so much abou d Holland Park I the subject, but about communicating, about\nmyself, about kids, and about the education\nsystem.\nSome of the experiences of other tutors\n(below) provide an indication of the sort of\nthings we have been doing. Currently we tutor\nin science, engineering, maths and electronics\nat nearly all levels, from primary to sixth form,\nso if you like you can choose a subject and age\ngroup to tutor in.\nWomen students are particularly needed in\nscience and engineering classes to tutor girl\npupils who often think 'batteries, wires and\nthings is boys stuff.\nIf you think you might like to take part don't hesitate to get in touch.\nGianCarlo\nAero 2\nFox Primary School\nThis year has been the first year which we\nhave operated at a primary school. Fox was\nchosen because it is a \"feeder\" school for\nHolland Park.\nAt the beginning we had immense practical problems since science, as such, is\nnot taught in primary schools. What are we\nmeant to do when we walk into a class of ten\nyear olds for an afternoon with the intention\nof 'tutoring science'?\nFifteen weeks later, I finally think we are\noperating the scheme as it should be. As an\nexample; when there was lots of snow about\nwe spent two weeks studying the different\nstates of H20, in terms of temperature,\nvolume, textures, taste and appearance. It\nmight sound basic but it is in fact very useful\nfor the children and great fun for everyone.\nJohn Hughes\nElec Eng 2\nScience Tutoring\nAfter two years of totally wasted Wednesday\nif ter noon s,I felt I should take my last chance\no become involved in something at College\nthat was useful but non-academic. The Pimlico\nConnection provided just what I was looking\nfor. It was an opportunity to find out what\neducation means to the majority of kids in\nLondon, give a helping hand to them and to\nthe teachers and to have a lot of fun.\nI tutored science (biology, chemistry and\nphysics) to fourteen year olds. There are\nnormally two or three tutors to a class of about\ntwenty-five. Most of the children I met were\nvery friendly and cooperative and obviously\nenjoyed science lessons more with our help.\nThere is a definite tendency for the girls to'\nprefer biology and the boys physics, but women\ntutors do help to kindle the girls' interest in all\naspects of science. There is much scope here\nfor the Pimlico Connection to achieve even\nmore success. I managed to convince one girl\nthat if she wanted to become a nurse, qualifications were important, and her interest\nand hence quality of work improved after this.\nIt gives great satisfaction to feel you have\nhelped these kids, who may not have had the\nsame chances as you or I, to see that science is\ninteresting and worthwhile in terms of a possible career.\nJackie Wood\nMan Sci 3\nJ L Sir Walter St John, Battersea Engineering Tutoring\nThis was my first year with the Pimlico Connection and to begin with it was strange\nacting as a tutor compared to being tutored as\nat College.\nThe subjects we helped were woodwork,\nmetalwork and technical drawing; metalwork\nproving the most popular amongst the pupils.\nThe atmosphere in the workshops was\nalways friendly and we found it easy to get on\nwith the kids who were all fourteen year olds.\nWe were always kept busy sorting out\nproblems and helping with the work and in\nconnection with this, I think it is necessary to\nhave some basic knowledge of workshop techniques. I must stress that the emphasis is\non helping and not teaching. It seemed our\nmain aim was to interest the kids in their\nsubject and promote enthusiasm and for this\nreason, we took a couple of classes down to\nBritish Aerospace for a factory visit which was\ngood fun for all. The kids certainly found the\nlessons more interesting and enjoyable with\nthe tutors and it made a refreshing change for\nWednesday afternoons.\nJonathan Wheeler\nElec Eng 2\nTo take part in 1982-83:\nNo previous experience is\nneeded.\nTime involved:\n1:30-3:30pm( approx) Weds afternoons in Autumn and\nfirst tour weeks of spring term.\nJust come along to one of our regular Tuesday lunches in\nElec Eng606orcontactDr J.

The College came close to\ncollecting all the three cups, but RSM II were narrowly\ndefeated in their final.\nIC II began the day with a convincing 5-1 win against QM C III,\nputting them in 'high spirits' for the afternoon finale on the main\nMotspur pitch. There, in a hard, competitive match which, due to\nnerves and the unfamiliar surroundings was memorable more for its\ndrama and excitement than its standard of football, ICI clinched\nvictory in extra-time, having scored all the goals in the 2-1 win. Unfortunately, the occasion was slightly spoilt by crowd violence\ninstigated by a partisan (and exceedingly drunk) Goldsmith's following\nwhich started at half-time and continued sporadically throughout the\nrest of the afternoon. Indeed, the referee's concern was such that he\nthreatened to abandon the match, if the situation de tio rated. In direct contrast the vociferous IC support was directed to events on\nthe pitch, thus lifting the team to a well-deserved victory. (See sports\npage for match reports.)\n8 I'i/ \u2022 : II Jim Beer (left) standing in for the Second XI Captain Ron Wiggins and First XI\nCaptain Steve Ward with their trophies.\nThe Returning Officer for the sabbatical elections, Mr Marco\nLedwold, has decided that the decision taken at yesterday's Results UGM to re-run the elections was ultra vire s the\nconstitution.\nThis means the decision made by Election Committee at\nmidday yesterday to ratify the four elections still stands.\nThose deemed elected are Mr Stephen Goulder as President,\nMr Philip Greenstreet as Deputy President, Miss Mary\nFreeman as Honorary Secretary and Mr Martin S. Taylor as\nFelix Editor.\nMr Ledwold stated that the voting schedule clearly said that\nElection Committee can ratify any election unless a valid objection is\nlodged, as defined in the constitution. In this case the result must be\nbrought before aUG M. However the objection at yesterday's Results\nU GM was constitutionally invalid, he said.\nAt the UG MMr Led wold asked for objections to the individual elections and after none were raised against Deputy President or\nHonorary Secretary, the meeting voted not to approve the Presidential\nElection alone on the grounds that the electorate were mislead by a sentence about abstentions in last week's FELIX. After a series of confusing speeches and proposals the current\nPresident, Mr Nick Morton, explained that if one election was rejected\non a challenge to election procedure, then it applied equally to all of\nthem. Thus by rejecting one on these grounds the meeting was\nrejecting them all.\nMr Morton then proposed a motion to ratify the entire election but\nafter opposition from Academic Affairs Officer Mr Mike Booty this was\ndefeated on the vote.\nThe meeting adjourned thinking that the election would be re-run,\nbut later the Returning Officer discovered that the decision was invalid\nand hence a re-run would be ultra-vire s the constitution. Thus the\nElection Committee decision to ratify all the elections still stands.\nAn emergency U GM will be held on Thursday March25 for the\nhustings for the posts of External Affairs Officer, Academic Affairs\nOfficer, Ents Officer and U GM Chairman, which were not held\nyesterday.\nSTOIC would like to apologise for a broadcast they made at 6 pm yesterday announcing a re-run, as they were not informed of the latest\ndecision before the programme.\nThe full ramifications of this action are not known at the time of\ngoing to press.\nNo.609 Friday March12,1982 Free!

    "content": "Beaumont on a sticky wicket\nThe Left Alliance anti-apartheid campaign started on Wednesday\nlunchtime when three prominent members of pressure groups\naddressed a relatively small audience in Huxley Theatre 213.\nLord Beaumont, former Liberal Party Chairman, began\nproceedings by saying that apartheid was a bad thing and we certainly\nshouldn't support the regime in any way, but it was perfectly alright to\nplay cricket with them.\nMr Cosmos Desmond, a former director of Amnesty International,\npurported that the regime was due to the logic of capitalism and not\nreason. Mr Desmond stated that the whiteman had come to South\nAfrica for the sole reason of exploiting the land and its people and had\nsoon developed a ruthlessly effective method of control. It became\ntaken for granted that the state would determine where you live, who\nyou can marry even where you can be buried. A more recent\nphenomenon is the placing of blacks in trible homelands now that their\nlabour has been superseded by machines.\nA more radical line was taken by Mr Abdul S. Minty, Honorary\nSecretary for the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who accused the West of\nactively supporting the brutal regime by not supplying arms to African\nfront line states whilst supplying South Africa with sophisticated radar\nequipment. Sanctions, he stated, are the only peaceful weapon at the\nWest's disposal, so in lifting sanctions Reagan is giving support to\nSouth Africa's aggressive stance towards front line states.\nEngineering\nChief at IC\nSir Kenneth Corfield, Chairman\nof the Engineering Council, addressed the Industrial Society\non Tuesday. With the Rector in\nthe Chair Sir Kenneth spoke on\nwhat a university education\nshould be and the British manufacturing industry.\nIC's four year engineering\ncourses were praised whilst other\ncourses were criticised for not\ncovering economics. Sir Kenneth\nwarned against over special is ation and condemned \"the blinkered\napproach\" it produces. His idea\nwould be long, broad courses\nresembling the American system,\nwith high entrance requirements.\nSir Kenneth was concerned\nabout the image engineering has\nof simply \"getting your hands\ndirty\" and said the status of\nengineers must be raised, although\nraising salaries isn't the entire\nsolution.\nBemoaning shoddy goods, Sir\nKenneth said consumers must be\ndiscriminating and buy high\nquality products. He applauded\nthe various Standards Institutes\nand consumer bodies, and hoped\nthat their work would help\nprevent major British industries\ndying, like the motorcycle and\ncamera industries already have.\nLondon Student\nto fold?\nThe election for the next Editor\nof London Student (formerly\nSennet) has been deferred\nbecause of doubt over the paper's future.\nThe paper is currently running\nat a loss and it is not certain that\nthe post will be sabbatical next\nyear. In addition the current\nEditor, Miss Sarah Laithwaite, is\nto resign at the end of this term\nbecause of exams. Although Miss\nLaithwaite is a sabbatical she\ndeferred her final exams last year\nwhich means she must sit them\nnext term.\nHowever this hasn't prevented\nLondon Student from organising a number of events for other\nstudent newspapers in London.\nOn Saturday a teach-in was\norganised to demonstrate the\nbasic principles ol news reporting\nwhilst on Tuesday the London\nStudent Journalist Group met.\nAlthough the group has yet to\nelect a committee acting chair-person. Miss Karen Marchbank.\nhas agreed to arrange a speaker\nmeeting for early next term.
