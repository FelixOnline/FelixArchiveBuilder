As any fans\nof Community can tell you, Dan\nHarmon is know for not following\nthe classic tropes you see on most\nmedia. His style is his own unique\nthing, doing away with typical\nclich\u00e9s entirely or portraying them\nwith a different spin.\nRick and Morty is no exception\nwith the show either parodying\nseveral sci-fi tropes and/or taking\nthem in wild and over-the-top\ndirections.The payoff is a bizarre but\nhighly entertaining and humorous\nset of episodes that\u2019ll have you\ncraving the next installment. For\nexample, in an inception-style\nepisode, our main characters enter\na dream, within a dream, within a\ndream,for the purpose of convincing\nMorty\u2019s math teacher to give him\nbetter grades.\nThe series features Rick, an\nold, outlandish and alcoholic\nscientist, and his gullible grandson\nMorty, who go on various crazy\nand dangerous adventures across\nalternate universes and different\na lonely, troubled, haunted past.\nThe viewer is also exposed to a less\nnuanced part of his personality \u2013 a\nreal and deep concern for his family.\nMeanwhile, we see Morty grow and\nevolve, becoming more confident,\ntaking initiative and standing up to\nRick now and again.\nBesides these two,other characters\nwith their own traits feature, each\nbringing something new to the\ntable. The most prominent of them\nis the rest of Rick and Morty\u2019s\ndysfunctional family. These include\nhis parents Beth, Morty\u2019s assertive,\nlevel-headed and dissatisfied\nmother,and Jerry,his insecure father\nwho severely disapproves of Rick.\nMorty\u2019s older sister Summer\nalso graces the screen more as the\nshow progresses, with her being\nconventional, superficial and\nsomewhat jealous of Morty having\nall the fun. These characters get\nincreasingly involved in different\nand interesting ways as the show\ngoes along, though sometimes the\nsubplots leave much to be desired.\nSeeing Rick have a go at Jerry never\nloses its charm. The characters are\nwritten so well that the viewers\neven care for characters who show\nsectors of space.\nThe major crux of the show is\nthe interplay between Rick and\nMorty, which never gets old. Rick\nis depicted as a genius scientist,\nfull of witty one-liners, preferring\nto live free and party hard, always\nconsidering himself superior to\nothers. Morty, in contrast, is good-natured but easily distressed and is\nfrequently shown to be reluctant and\ndisapproving of his grandfather\u2019s\nmethods resulting in several causes\nof friction and drama between the\ntwo.\nThe characters may seem a little\none-dimensional at first, but as\nthe series progresses, we gain more\ninsight into the development and\nlayers of our protagonists. For\nexample, behind Rick\u2019s brash,\narrogant and lively exterior, there\u2019s\nweird or out-of-place, instead\nalways cooming naturally.\nAn example of a more softcore\nincident is when Morty gets tired of\nall the crazy stuff he\u2019s put through\nand goes full on berserk mode, \u00e0 la\nthe purge.\nThis clever and inventive show\nis the epitome of high-concept\nstorytelling, with a healthy dose\nof hilarity and poignant character\nmoments mixed in now and\nagain for sustained emotional and\npunch. Many of these episodes are\nstandalone, though there is a greater\nfocus on continuity as the show\nevolves.\nHowever, this is nothing too\ntaxing and the creators know just\nhow much to lean on it so that future\ndevelopments carry more weight.At\ntimes, Rick and Morty becomes its\nown worst enemy,becoming slightly\nless innovative and repeating old\nstorylines. However, even these\nepisodes are written wonderfully,\nand if they\u2019re the worst the show has\nto offer, it speaks volumes about the\noverall quality.\nFor a show that was initially an\nadults-only Back to the Future\nparody, Rick and Morty has now\nbecome something much more\nspecial. With the successful formula\nof merging high-concept sci-fi\nstorytelling with biting humour\nand a dash of emotionally complex\ncharacter development, this show\nis always a blast to watch, and I\nhighly recommend it if you haven\u2019t\nwatched it yet.\nAnd that\u2019s the waaaayyy we go!!\nRick and Morty is available on\nAdult Swim\nup only a couple of times like bird\nperson (P.S. F*** Tammy).\nAmidst these mad hijinks,\nthe show has some dark and\nuncomfortable moments in which\nRick and Morty are put through\npretty extreme stuff. While a little\ndisconcerting to watch, these\nmoments help shape our characters\nwhen moving forward. It is also a\nsign of the greatness of the show-moments such as these never seem\nAmidst\nthese mad\nhijinks, the\nshow has\nsome dark\nmoments\nThis\nclever and\ninventive\nshow is the\nepitome\nof high-concept\nstorytelling\nLet\u2019s get Schwifty!.

Photo Credit: Adult Swim\nSaad Ahmed\nTelevision Editor\nSteven Avery \u2013 the victim of the story Photo Credit: Netflix\nWho is responsible when an innocent man is sent to prison? Photo Credit: Netflix\nM\naking a Murderer,\nreleased to stream on\nNetflix in December\n2015, is Netflix\u2019s\nsecond foray into documentary\nfilmmaking after the mostly ignored\nChef\u2019s Table. It has already been\ndescribed by many as the service\u2019s\nmost addictive program yet.\nThe series follows the story\nof Steven Avery, a resident of\nManitowoc County, Wisconsin,\nconvicted of a crime he did not\ncommit, serving 18 years in prison\nbefore being found innocent\nthrough DNA exoneration. He\nthen decided to sue the county\nsheriff\u2019s department for $36 million\nfor the gross mishandling of his\ncase. However, before the case can\nbe settled, Avery is accused of the\nmurder of a woman named Teresa\nHalbach, the trial of which makes\nup to bulk of the series\u2019 runtime.\nWhat follows is an incredibly\nharrowing look into police and\njudicial corruption and misconduct.\nThere is evidence presented of\nthe police department, planting\nevidence, coercing witnesses and\nimproperly handling the legal\nproceedings of the case, among\nother equally disturbing acts.\nWhat is interesting about this\ndocumentary is the depth to which\nit investigates and presents the story.\nWhere one might usually expect\nsuch a documentary to cover this\nin around two hours, this series\nhas ten hours to provide lengthy\nexplanations for the evidence that\nAvery\u2019s defence presents, as well\nas the prosecution\u2019s explanations\n(or lack thereof). However, as this\nfeatures events spanning from 1985\nto 2014, focussing on a case that\nitself had over 200 hours worth of\nevidence presented, there are, of\ncourse, omissions that one could\ntake issue with.\nThe series does suffer slightly\nin that it undoubtedly has bias\nsimple adolescent antics, the reality\nof which is much more disturbing.\nHe was arrested and jailed three\ntimes prior to his false accusation,\nfor burglary of a local store, assault\nof his cousin and, most shockingly,\nfor dousing his cat in gasoline and\nsetting it on fire. Omissions such as\nthese serve only to undermine the\npurpose of the documentary which\nshould not be to paint Avery as a\nsaint,but to display the mishandling\nand sabotaging of the case by\nthe Manitowoc Country Sheriff\nDepartment.\nI would, despite this, unreservedly\nrecommend watching the series,\nif for no other reason than to join\nin the cultural phenomenon it has\nbecome.\nWarning: The rest of this review\nwill contain spoilers.\nIn the short time since its release,\ntheshowhasreachedmemeticstatus,\nwith a change.org petition calling for\nPresident Obama to release Steven\nAvery reaching nearly 450,000\nsignatures, despite such an action\nbeing outside of the President\u2019s\njurisdiction. It has also inspired\nmany couch detectives giving their\ntheories on what really happened to\nTeresa Halbach. People have been\nblaming anyone from her brother\nto her roommate, to the police\ndepartment themselves for her\nmurder. To make such unfounded\naccusations goes against the very\npurpose of the documentary, that it\nis not okay to accuse someone of a\ncrime just because of your personal\nfeelings toward them.\nMany members of the Manitowoc\nSheriff\u2019s Department featured\nin the show have had to release\nstatements providing their views\non the documentary, with most\ndismissing it, claiming it skips huge\nswathes of evidence that implicate\nAvery in the murder.However,none\nhave responded to the claims of\nevidence planting laid against them.\nThe documentary certainly came\nat the right time. With so much\ndiscussion all over the US on police\ncorruption and unfair treatment\nof minorities, this is undoubtedly\na large contributing factor to its\nsuccess, and one that makes it hit so\nclose to home for so many people.\nThe most harrowing part of\nthe documentary is the interview\nof Brendan Dassey, Avery\u2019s\nnephew. The video shows two\nexperienced detectives coercing\nand manipulating a 16 year-old\ninto admitting to committing\nvarious heinous actions on Halbach\nincluding, but not limited to, rape,\ntorture and murder.\nThroughout the interrogation it\nis clear that Dassey does not fully\nrealise the consequences of what\nhe is saying, and is just saying\nwhatever he thinks the detectives\nwant to hear in order to go home.\nThe interrogation was eventually\ndeemed to be inadmissible in\ncourt but not before the District\nAttorneys describe in graphic detail\nall that was said, diminishing both\nAvery\u2019s and Dassey\u2019s chances to win\nfair trials.\nMaking a Murderer is available on\nNetflix\nin Steven Avery\u2019s favour. This\nmanifests mainly in downplaying\nsome of the darker parts of Avery\u2019s\npast, most egregiously dismissing\nAvery\u2019s criminal activity prior to\nhis false conviction for rape as\nThe series\ndoes suffer\nslightly\nin that it\nundoubtedly\nhas bias\nin Steven\nAvery\u2019s\nfavour\nThere are,\nof course,\nomissions\nthat one\ncould take\nissue with\n\n"

What does it all mean?\nMatt Johnston\nNews Editor\nT\nhe United States\nPresidential election.\nThe $6 billion race\nfor the White House.\nThe battle between Democrats\nand Republicans, Donkeys versus\nElephants. Like an Olympics for\npoliticians, it happens every four\nyears and has the potential to shape\nworld economics and policy until\nthe next one.\nBut what on earth is\nhappening?\nFebruary 1st\nmarks the start of\nthe Presidential nomination race,\nspecifically the Iowa Caucus, with it\nbeing the first time the public can\nvoice their opinions. This process\nwill contribute to the eventual\ndecision on which candidates are\npicked to represent the Republicans\nand Democrats in the November\npresidential election.\nRepublican frontrunners include\nTed Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben\nCarson, Jeb Bush and the man\nof the moment, Donald J Trump.\nThey are in competition against\nthe Democrat candidates, Hillary\nClinton, Bernie Sanders and, to a\nlesser extent, Martin O\u2019Malley.\nBut what is a caucus I hear you\nscream, and is it the same thing as a\nprimary? Well scream no more.\nCaucuses and primaries are\nindeed different things but they\nlargely serve the same purpose, to\ndecide the makeup of delegates who\nvote for each party\u2019s presidential\nelection candidate at the National\nConvention in July. Each state, as\nwell as a selection of other territories\n(notably American Samoa, District\nof Colombia, Guam and Puerto\nRico) each get either a primary or\na caucus from which the makeup of\ndelegates is decided.\nWho gets delegates?\nHow many delegates a certain\nregion gets is dependant on a\ncrazy and confusing system of\nrules and regulations, which change\ndepending on the party. Several\nrules that the Republican party uses\ninclude choosing delegates based\non the number of representatives\nthat the state has in the House and\nSenate, and whether the state voted\nfor the Republican candidate at the\nlast election.\nThe Democrats, however, take\ninto consideration the previous\nelection voting in comparison to the\nwider nation, as well as the electoral\ncollege votes that each state has\n(a crude way of incorporating\npopulation). Bonus delegates are\nalso assigned for a multitude of\nreasons, ranging from when you\nhold the primary/caucus to if your\nneighbouring states also hold theirs\non the same date in a process known\nas \u201cclustering\u201d.\n(Fun fact: Hawaii and Alaska\nare classed as neighbours of\nWashington and Oregon for this.)\nEssentially all the relevant, and\nseemingly irrelevant, data is fed\ninto the system, the alignment of\nthe planets is checked and if the\ngroundhog sees his shadow then\nyou\u2019ve somehow got yourself some\ndelegates.\nSo how are these\ndelegates chosen?\nWell, some aren\u2019t for a start.\nThese delegates are referred to as\nunpledged or are given the snazzy\ntitle of \u2018Superdelegate\u2019 and are free\nto choose who they like out of the\ncandidates. At the Democratic\nconference there are around 700\nof these Superdelegates, making\nup roughly 15% of the total vote\nand comprising of high ranking\nparty members as well as former\nPresidents and Vice Presidents.\nThe Republicans select far fewer,\naround 168, which equates to\naround 5% of their vote and these\nare drawn from three senior party\nmembers from each of the regions\nwho have a vote.\nSuperdelegates can sway the\noverall vote, as well as the larger\npublic opinion, and are seen from\nopposing sides as either a steady\nhand to guide the nomination\nprocess or an encroachment into\nan otherwise purely democratic\nselection.\nBut what about the remainder\nof delegates? That\u2019s where the\nprimaries and caucuses come in.\nPrimaries\nPrimaries are similar to any other\nelection and a secret ballot is held in\nwhich delegates are selected based\nThere\u2019s gonna be hell toup\u00e9e. Photo Credit: ABC News\non these results. The complications\narise when a primary is either open\nor closed as this affects who can\nvote. Usually in a closed primary\nonly voters who are registered with\nthat party can vote, but some states\ndo allow independent voters to cast\ntheir vote too.\nIn contrast, an open primary\nmeans that a registered voter may\nvote in either party\u2019s primary but\nonly in one (i.e. a Republican\nvoter may vote for the Democratic\nnomination but not the Republican\nnomination too). Open primaries\nhave been criticised for allowing\na certain extent of vote rigging to\noccur, as one side may vote to get\na weaker opposition candidate in\norder to stand a better chance in the\nfinal, presidential election.\nPrimaries of one form or another\ntake place in all regions bar ten\n(Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Kansas,\nMaine, Minnesota, Nevada, North\nDakota, Wyoming and Iowa) and\nthe remainder have the mystical\ncaucuses.\nCaucuses\nVoting at caucuses is conducted\nat a large number of small meetings\nacross the state in question, with the\nresults from all these combined and\nthen distributed to the delegates.\nThe way in which these are\nconducted again vary by both state\nand party but the general format is\na period of debate and discussion,\nfollowed by a vote.These can be both\nopen and closed like the primaries,\nand mostly follow the same rules.\nSome states have systems in which\nthe voting is done via a secret ballot\nand some via physically moving into\ngroups of voters with a count being\ntaken. It\u2019s all a bit of a mess as to\nwho does what.\nBut why have both?\nIt\u2019s a case of different votes for\ndifferent folks and all that really.\nEach have pros and cons as although\nthe caucuses usually allow decisions\nto be made on wider issues aside\nfrom the election, they take longer,\nmeaning only the more politically\nengaged voters in the state turn up.\nIn the end all the votes from\nthe state get tallied up, and the\ndelegates are given out either in a\nproportional or in a winner-takes-all fashion, depending on the party,\nstate and what time of year it is\n(genuinely).\nWell what\u2019s so special\nabout Iowa then?\nThe Iowa Caucus is the top dog\nwhen it comes to caucuses and this\nlargely boils down to the fact that\nit is first. It gained it\u2019s frontrunner\nposition in 1972 due to hotel rooms\n(don\u2019t ask) and tradition/state law\nmeans it has now become the first\nevent of the nomination calendar.\nThis means that it has great\ninfluence on the trajectory of the\nwhole campaign as it is gives a first\nindication to see who voters are\nfavouring.This can change campaign\nstrategies wildly in some cases, and\ncan even cause participants who fair\nterribly to drop out all together.\nResults from Iowa have also been\nknown to cause a snowballing effect\nin which endorsements and visibility\nis garnered for candidates who were\nseemingly unnoticed beforehand.\nThe whole Iowa circus tends to\npropagate its own existence too, as\nwhere the media are, the candidates\nusually aren\u2019t too far behind and vice\nversa.This has lead to the seemingly\ninnocuous state being national and\ninternational news for a brief period\nevery four years.\nCome on then, will Trump\nactually be our overlord?\nMaybe, possibly, who knows. All\nthat is certain is that he stands a\ndecent chance of becoming the\nnomination for the Republican\nparty at least. This is largely in part\nto the plethora of different rules\nthat could fall in Donald\u2019s favour\n(such as the cross party voting by\nDemocrats to bolster their chances).\nA big indication will come this\nMonday as to his, and indeed\nthe candidates from both party\u2019s\nchances, but there\u2019s over 280 days\nand a lot of voting before it\u2019s all over.\n\n"

The Big Short is a\nfilm that takes all these methods,\nbundles them up into a great big\nfist, shatters the wall with a single\npunch, and grabs the viewer by their\nears, screaming: \u201cHEY. LISTEN.\nWE\u2019RE TRYING TO TELL\nYOU SOMETHING.\u201d\nWhat it\u2019s trying to tell you, on\nthe surface at least, is the story of a\nbunch of outsiders who foresaw the\ncollapse of the worldwide housing\nmarket and did what they could to\nprofit from it \u2013 centred particularly\naround hedge fund managers Dr.\nMichael Burry (Christian Bale) and\nMark Baum (Steve Carrell), and\nWall Street trader Jared Vennett\n(Ryan Gosling). But as the movie\nunfolds it becomes clear that\nwhat it\u2019s really trying to tell you is\nsomething much more serious, and\nmuch more important; something\nyou already know, but have never\nwanted to.\nThe multi-character perspective\nfrom which the film\u2019s story is told\nallows us to interact with the real\npeople who were tied up in the\ninsanely nebulous market crash\n\u2013 we come face to face with the\nvillains and victims of the event.\nDirector and screenwriter Adam\nMcKay\u2019s previous films have never\nbeen afraid of poking a hefty dose of\nfun at modern society \u2013 the absurd\nnationalism displayed by overly-proud Americans was taken to the\ntenth power in Talladega Nights,and\nthe nature of over-saturation of air-headed news networks was subtly\nexplored in the Anchorman films\n\u2013 but the comedy in this film sits\nsquarely in the back seat.\nThe film\u2019s breaking of the fourth\nwall becomes painfully astute;\nit reminds us that the crisis was\ncaused by a small number of\nbankers so desperate to make even\nmore money that they were willing\nto gamble with the livelihoods of\nthe general population. But more\nworryingly, it tells us that if more\npeople had simply looked harder at\nthe ugly truth, perhaps the whole\nmess could have been avoided. As\nthe film reaches its conclusion, we\nrealise with a heavy heart that we\nalready know exactly how it ends,\nand that rather than creating some\nkind of propaganda piece in hopes\nof inciting a rebellion against \u2018the\nsystem, maaan,\u2019all the film has done\nis present us with the facts. The\nmarketing tagline chosen for the\nfilm is a perfect pick, and develops\na whole new meaning after leaving\nthe theatre: \u201cThis is a true story\u201d.\nIt speaks volumes of the McKay\u2019s\ntalent that The Big Short makes its\ndesperate subject matter not only\narresting, but also hilarious, and\nnever uninteresting to watch. An\nexcellent effort from the production\nteam results in a slick, perfectly\nstylised viewing experience; the tiny\ndetails that make all the difference\nfly by in a blink-and-you-miss-it fashion \u2013 seconds-long shots\nof pictures of our protagonists\u2019\nchildren on their desks are not\nfollowed by scenes of the characters\u2019\ngood parenting techniques, but\nrather even quicker shots of those\nsame children at home tapping\naway on MacBooks, implies they\u2019re\nindifferent to whether their fathers\ncare about them or not. The story\u2019s\nmost important moments ring loud\nand clear, but never feel forced or\nover-the-top.\nOn top of the dramatic heft the\ntrue story packs, McKay manages\nto squeeze even more sympathy out\nof the audience with a set of vivid,\noddball characters who bring the\nscreen to life \u2013 although perhaps the\nreal reasons behind the audience\u2019s\nsympathy for these characters is the\nstrength of the performances. Bale\nChristian Bale sweeps up the nominations with his performance as Dr. Michael Burry in The Big Short. Photo Credit: Paramount Pictures\nTom Stephens\nFilm Writer\nThe Big\nShort is\ntechnically\nalmost\nflawless,\nwritten with\ncutting wit\nAll\u2019s fair in love and finance\nEsoteric economics are brought down to earth in Adam McKay\u2019s hugely enjoyable film\nhappens to be the one raking in\naward nominations for his portrayal\nof Asperger\u2019s-suffering economic\nvisionary Dr.Burry,and his carefully\nselected opus of mannerisms (not\nto mention his skills on a drum-kit) are deployed to fantastic effect,\nbut in truth there is not a bad\nperformance in this movie. Special\nrecognition should go to everyone,\nincluding each member of Baum\u2019s\nteam (Rafe Spall,Jeremy Strong and\nHamish Linklater), as well as John\nMagaro and Finn Wittrock, who\nportray Charlie Geller and Jamie\nShipley respectively, two young\nhedge fund upstarts who cross paths\nwith Vennett and get ahead on the\nmarket\u2019s collapse.\nBut if that recognition can only\ngo to a few, it is fully deserved by\nthe leads \u2013 Ryan Gosling has never\nbeen so convincing as Vennett,\nwith a sliminess and a smoothness\nthat makes for a bafflingly effective\ncombination, and Steve Carell\u2019s\nturn as the perpetually on-edge and\ndeeply pained Baum continues the\nexpansion of his now incredibly\ndiverse acting range. Any of the\nthree would be worthy of the\nnominations in my mind, but the\nfact that Bale\u2019s equally excellent\nperformance is the one receiving\nthem will certainly not have me\nlosing sleep.\nThe Big Short is a film that may\nbe difficult to think about after\nwatching, since its subject matter\nonly reveals its true importance\nupon reflection. But the fact\nremains that it is technically almost\nflawless, written with cutting-edge\nwit, excellently directed and acted,\nand ultimately truly essential.\nDocumentary corner: American Movie\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nI\nt\u2019s not often you see a\ndocumentary split opinion\nin such a love-it-or-hate-it fashion. I suppose that is\nsomething that comes with \u2018cult\nfilm\u2019 territory, and personally,\nwhen I think of the label of \u2018cult\nclassic\u2019, American Movie is the\nfirst film that comes to mind. The\nstar here is Mark Borchardt \u2013 an\namateur filmmaker who has spent\nhis whole life trying to inspire his\nfamily and slacker friends to fund,\nstar in, and help produce a short\nhorror film \u2018Coven\u2019. He does this in\norder to garner interest and money,\neventually allowing him to produce\nhis magnum opus \u2018Northwestern\u2019.\nMark\u2019s charm manifests itself in\nhis unwavering enthusiasm in the\nface of ridiculous odds; What one\ncomes to realise is that everybody\nbut Mark \u2013 and his best friend/\nside-kick Mark Schank \u2013 knows\nthat Coven is doomed. We see\nscene-after-scene of failed shoots,\nhorrific acting based on a woeful\nscript, topped off by laughable\nspecial effects. If you look up the\ninfamously hilarious scene of Mark\u2019s\nattempts to direct his bored and\ngrumpy Uncle Bill (the unwilling\nmain financier of the project) to\nsay just one line \u201cIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s ok!\nThere\u2019s something to live for! Jesus\ntold me so!\u201d you\u2019ll get the idea.\nBut, of course, complexity is\npresent beyond the can\u2019t-lookaway car crash humour. What is\nso uniquely brilliant about this\nfilm is how hilarious it can be\nwhilst simultaneously maintaining\na serious and quite depressing\nundertone.\nThis, I feel, warrants some\nexplanation. The difficulty here\nis that describing this movie\naccurately is near-impossible due\nto it simply being that bizarrely\ndichotomous in its feel. Some\nexamples may give a rough idea\nthough. One line that stands out is\nwhen, following an endless string\nof laboured takes, Mark shouts to\nUncle Bill \u201cyou have to believe in\nwhat you\u2019re saying!\u201d to which Bill\nbitterly replies \u201cWell, I don\u2019t; I don\u2019t\nbelieve in nothing you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nThe pessimism shown by Uncle Bill\nthroughout really contrasts and cuts\nthrough the child-like enthusiasm\nof Mark, helping us to see past his\nfantasy world and understand the\nreality of his life. Both Mark and\nMike grew up in a very working\nclass area of Milwaukee and\nboth experienced quite desolate\nupbringings; both face a number of\ndemons. A burgeoning alcoholism\nis evident in the film, and Mark\u2019s\nissues with both gambling and a\ndeeply dysfunctional family are also\nexplored later on. Mike, at several\npoints, explains that the only thing\nfor friends to do for fun in his city\nis slack off and drink can-after-can\nof shit beer.\nI consider American Movie to be\none of the best documentary films\never made, and would happily\nplace it very high up on a list of\nmy favourite movies. What it\npresents to the viewer is a uniquely\nunpolished, warts-and-all look into\nthe lives of people attempting to\ndo away with their label of \u201ctrailer\npark white trash,\u201d achieve success in\nHollywood, and live the American\nDream.\n\u201cCoven, man, we gotta get this sucker done, though.\u201d Photo Credit: American Movie PR\nThe Big Short\nDir: Adam McKay. Script: Adam\nMcKay,Charles Randolph.Starring:\nChristian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan\nGosling, Brad Pitt. 130 minutes.\nThe Assassin\nDir: Hou Hsiao-Hsien. Script:\nHou Hsiao-Hsien, Chu Tien-wen.\nStarring: Shu Qi, Chang Chen,\nZhou Yun. 105 minutes.\nI\ntried to like The Assassin. I\nreally, really did try. First\nhearing about it during its\nrapturous reception in Cannes,\nwhere Hou Hsiao-Hsien became\nthe second Taiwanese director in the\nfestival\u2019s history to win the coveted\nBest Director Award,I watched as it\nmade its way towards a UK release,\npushed along by wave after wave\nof ecstatic reviews. After seeing it\nat the London Film Festival I was\nleft disappointed; the glacial pace\nof the film meant there were many\npoints where I drifted off. But then\na few months later, The Assassin was\nnamed Sight and Sound\u2019s best film\nof 2015. I must have been overtired,\nI rationalised to myself; I ought\nto give it another shot, and really\nfocus this time, to try and catch\nwhat I had missed. Well, call me a\nphilistine, but I really didn\u2019t get it \u2013\nHsiao-Hsien has indeed created a\nthing of beauty, a work of art in the\nmost aesthetic sense of the word,\nbut his insistence of keeping the\naudience removed from the work\nresults in a feeling of tedium and\noverwhelming isolation.\nSet in 8th\nCentury China, The\nAssassin\u2019s premise is that a young\nwoman from the province of\nWeibo was given away to a nun at\na young age, who trained her up to\nbecome a master of the sword, and\na lethal assassin. After fobbing an\nassignment, she is returned home,\nunder strict instruction to kill her\ncousin, to whom she was once\nbetrothed. This is all explained in\nthe first five minutes of the film, a\nstunning black and white tableau of\nnature and violence; to say that the\nplot only thickens from there is an\nunderstatement. A political rivalry\nbetween Weibo and the Imperial\nCourt, along with a revolving cast\nof characters, whose presence is\nunexplained or justified, means that\noften we are swimming in a sea of\nconfusion without the lifejacket of\ncontext. While a second viewing\nrevealed more of the plot, the entire\nset-up was so impenetrable that at\nsome points I felt it would be more\nworthwhile to ignore the subtitles\non the screen, and just let the poetic\nvisuals wash over me.\nAnd what visuals these are.\nHsiao-Hsien is a master behind\nthe camera, constructing intricate\ninterior scenes, where billowing\nsilk obfuscates the view of the\nlens, which contrast with the vast\ndramatic landscapes of rural China.\nCinematographer Mark Lee Ping\nBin, of In the Mood for Love fame,\ngracefully handles the interplay\nof light within the film, providing\nHsiao-Hsien with a ravishing colour\npalette from which to construct this\nvisual tone-poem.\nBut while the style is there, a\nsense of substance isn\u2019t \u2013 or at\nleast, it\u2019s so deeply buried within\nthe labyrinthine plot as to make\nit invisible. While Ang Lee\u2019s\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\nmay have elevated wuxia films to\nhigh-art, making them appealing\nto Western viewers, The Assassin\ntries to take things to another level;\nhowever, the high-intensity nature\nof wuxia and the laconic character\nof the film are uneasy bedfellows.\nUltimately, The Assassin reminded\nme so much of the pots produced\nduring the Tang Dynasty in which\nthe film is set: stunning to look\nat, with a glossy surface of gilded\ncolour, but hollow on the inside.\nFRED FYLES\nShu Qi as Nie Yinniang, the titular assassin.

It can\nform on aeroplane parts\nat high altitudes and condenser\ncoils in fridges and windshields,\nparticularly during the winter\nmonths. Frost formation can create\nsuch a logistical headache, that in\nfact a large amount of money is\nrequired to ensure important units\nstay frost-free in order to maintain\ntheir function.\nHowever, a team of researchers\nfrom Virginia Tech has found\nan answer in an unlikely source.\nNamib desert beetles live in one\nof the hottest and driest climates\non Earth, Africa\u2019s Namib desert,\nwhich receives less than 1.3cm of\nrainfall a year. In order to survive,\nthey harvest water vapour from the\nocean breeze through the utilisation\nof their unique shell structure.\nWhereas bumps on their shell\nlearned from this peculiar survival\nmechanism that they can control\nwhere dewdrops form. To mimic\nthe beetle\u2019s\u2019 shell, water-attracting\npatterns are put on a water-repelling (hydrophobic) surface.\nDew can only form on top of these\nspecific patterns. As frost starts\nwith a single frozen dew drop and\nspreads to other connected droplets\nacross surfaces this information can\nbe applied to restricting or stopping\nthis occurrence. If the droplets that\nform are confined to very small\nareas and kept separated, the spread\nof frost can be stopped altogether.\n\u201cI appreciate the irony of how an\ninsect that lives in a hot, dry desert\ninspired us to make a discovery\nabout frost,\u201d said Jonathan Boreyko,\nan assistant professor of Biomedical\nEngineering and Mechanics at\nVirginia Tech. In these initial tests,\nBoreyko and his team were able\nto create a single dry zone which\nsurrounded a piece of ice. They are\nhoping to scale up their research to\nencompass large pieces of machinery\nsuch as wind turbines or aeroplanes\nin the future.\nThis technological breakthrough,\nalthough simple, could save a lot of\nmoney in the aeronautical and wind\nenergy industries. Currently a large\namount of chemicals are used in\norder to defrost equipment.\nThis is not the first time the Namib\ndesert beetle has inspired scientists.\nBack in 2012, the idea of a self-filling water bottle was initialised by\nLizzie Riach\nWriter\nFrom scorching deserts to frosty windows\nNamib desert beetle provides solution to the formation of frost on surfaces\nThe Namib desert beetle Stenocara dentata.

Luckily, 8% have some\nform of science degree and seem\ninterested in current research.\n20 years ago a group of science\ncommunicators joined forces with\nthe government and created the\nParliamentary Office of Science\nand Technology (POST). Today\nthe organisation is led by Dr Chris\nTyler and Dr Chandrika Nath and\nconsists of twelve staff members\nwho mediate between politicians\nand researchers, informing MPs\nof important scientific and\ntechnological issues.\nThis is achieved through the\nproduction of detailed yet concise\nbriefings, which are discussed in the\nscience conference room.\nThis quarterly process is important\nas it allows MPs to make informed,\nevidence based decisions on a range\nof subjects.\nStart your career with a bang at one of the UK\u2019s best employers: us.

Allowing universities\nthat produce high earners to charge\nmore, meaning the institutions that\neducate our nurses and carers will\nsee their income erode. Trapping\nstudents in the bind that if they rate\ntheir education highly, they support\nramping up fees for the next cohort.\nFinally, taking the authority to set\ntuition fees from Parliament and giving\nit to a single politician to raise at will.\nThe Government\u2019s Higher Education\nGreen Paper put forward a lot of\nideas; ideas that affect how students\nlearn - and pay up - for decades to\ncome. We are proud of our Green\nPaper Response (available in full at\nimperialcollegeunion.org/greenpaper),\nin which we oppose the majority\nof the ideas suggested. We found\nCollege, and much of the higher\neducation sector, agreeing with us.\nImperial College Union has long\nlobbied for improved teaching\nstandards, through our Academic\nRepresentation Network and Student\nAcademic Choice Awards; we feel\nthat teaching should be given as\nmuch respect and recognition as\nhigh-impact research. But when a\nTeaching Excellence Framework looks\nlike a back door to raising fees far past\n\u00a39k for selected institutions, we get\nsuspicious. When the sector agrees\nthat no one has a clear idea how\nimprovements in teaching excellence\ncan be reliably and fairly measured,\nwe get sceptical. Put it this way: even\nthe universities who want nothing\nmore than to raise fees right now are\nnot convinced that the TEF is the right\nway to do it. As it stands, the Teaching\nExcellence Framework idea is vague,\nrushed and unworkable. We ask that it\nbe delayed, put on a solid foundation\nof reliable data and processes, and\ntested for its ability to work in favour\nof students - and that it doesn\u2019t price\nstudents out of the education they\nmerit.\nThere are a number of other\nproposals in the Paper; two are worth\nmentioning now. One proposal -snuck in on page 64 - would allow\npoliticians to raise fees without\nParliamentary approval; we describe\nthis as fundamentally wrong, a historic\nmistake and a deeply undemocratic\ndecision. The other, on page 61,\nasks out of the blue what can be\ndone to make students\u2019 unions\nmore democratic and accountable,\nincluding the misguided suggestion\nthat students\u2019 unions should fall under\nthe umbrella of trade unions. I don\u2019t\nthink the Government expected the\noutpouring of support and respect\nfor the educational value of strong\nstudents\u2019 unions that has emerged\nfrom across the sector - including from\nCollege. Students\u2019 unions are amongst\nthe most transparent and democratic\norganisations you can think of, with\nhigh levels of engagement, open\nfinances, and student involvement at\nall levels.\nTaken together, these two proposals\nsum up the attitude to students and\nuniversities that underlies the whole\nGreen Paper. Centralise power to\npoliticians rather than academics,\ncharge individuals more and more, and\nundermine the single biggest group of\npeople in the whole higher education\nsystem: students.\nImperial College Union will continue to\nspeak up for its members by opposing\nthese measures, and suggesting\nmore sustainable and fairer reforms to\nhigher education at every opportunity.\nJennie Watson\nDeputy President (Welfare)\ndpwelfare@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial College Union has joined an\nelite group of organisations that hold\nthe Investors in People Gold award\nthis week. The Investors in People\nstandard accredits organisations\nthat excel at leading, supporting\nand managing their staff and is\nrecognised world-wide.\nImperial College Union was awarded\nthe basic standard in February 2015\nand less than a year later the Union\nhas been awarded the gold standard,\nwhich is only achieved by 7% of\nthe 15,000 organisations that hold\naccreditation. Awarded by Investors\nin People assessors, the gold award\njudges an organisations ability to\nmeet over 125 of 130 criteria through\na series of interviews with staff\nmembers. Successful accreditation\nagainst the Investors in People\nGold standard is the sign of a great\nemployer, an outperforming place\nto work and a clear commitment to\nsustainability.\nJoe Cooper, Managing Director,\nImperial College Union said \u201cImperial\nCollege Union is led by student\nofficers and its army of volunteers,\nbut it needs a team of highly talented,\nengaged and committed staff to\nensure that the Union delivers on its\nstrategic vision of being recognised as\na leader in student development and\nengagement. I am incredibly proud\nthat the ongoing hard work of our\nteam of staff and our management\nteam, and the commitment of\nour Board of Trustees to staff\ndevelopment, has been recognised\nwith this prestigious award. Imperial\nCollege Union is a great place\nto work, and this means we can\nprovide students with even better\nactivities, representation support and\ndevelopment opportunities\u201d. Louise\nLindsay, Director of HR, Imperial\nCollege London said \u201cThis external\nrecognition of the high standards of\nstaff development and professional\npractice is a great achievement for the\nUnion. The award is well deserved\nand reflects the transformative journey\nthe Union have undertaken over the\nlast few years in staff development\nand engagement. An exemplary\nrole model for others to follow.\u201d\nBy holding this award the Union\nclearly demonstrates that it is a great\nplace to work, helping us to better\nrecruit and retain the best possible\nstaff who in turn can continue to\nprovide the best services to our\nmembers and excel in our mission to\nenhance the student experience at\nImperial College London.\n\n"

I was\ndelighted that Imperial College\nUnion submitted a response,\nand indeed there is a great deal\nof common ground between the\nUnion\u2019s response and that of the\nCollege.\nThe focus of the College\u2019s response\nwas the introduction of a Teaching\nExcellence Framework (TEF).\nThe Government proposes that,\nthrough the TEF, an assessment\nof each university\u2019s teaching\nexcellence would be made, drawing\non quantitative measures and an\ninstitutional statement.\nUniversities achieving certain\nlevels of attainment in the TEF\nwould be allowed to increase the fees\nthey charge Home and European\nstudents to keep up with inflation.\nThe College welcomes initiatives\nthat promote excellent teaching.\nIn the government\u2019s own words,\nuniversities should be \u201cputting\nstudents at the heart of the system\u201d.\nA core part of our strategy is to\nprovide an educational experience\nin a vibrant, research-led,\nentrepreneurial environment where\nstudents learn alongside researchers\nwho are experts in their fields and\ngain the intellectual and practical\nskills to tackle the major challenges\nfacing society. Our close working\nrelationship with students, through\nImperial College Union, and with\nemployers is helping us to achieve\nthis.\nAssessing and incentivising\nteaching excellence across the\ndiverse range of universities in the\nUK is not straightforward. Our\nresponse voiced reservations about\nthe specific proposals in the Green\nPaper.\nOne concern is that the\nassessment methods for teaching\nexcellence proposed for the TEF\nfall short of the level of credibility,\nrigour and robustness that would\nmeet our own high standards and\nfulfil the Government\u2019s objective\nto stimulate higher quality teaching\nwhile maintaining the confidence in\nand support of the sector.\nThe proposed new assessment\nframework risks driving the wrong\nbehaviour, such as a focusing\non particular metrics that can\nbe \u2018gamed\u2019 rather than taking\na balanced approach to quality\nenhancement.\nFor those and other reasons, we\u2019ve\nargued strongly in our response that\nthe TEF should be fully piloted\nin order to develop an appropriate\nmeasure of excellence in teaching,\nidentify unintended consequences,\nand gain the confidence of the\nsector.\nImperial would be pleased to be\npart of any such pilot exercise. We\nalso said that while we strongly\nsupport policies to encourage\nstudents from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds to study at research-intensive universities such as\nImperial, we believe that these\ncrucial policies should be kept\nseparate in Access Agreements \u2013\na well-established and effective\nsystem \u2013 and not included with\nthe TEF as suggested in the Green\nPaper.\nThe Green Paper proposes that a\nsuccessful outcome in TEF would\nallow a university to increase fees\nwith inflation. We\u2019ve argued that\nthis link should not be mechanistic.\nTeaching quality \u2013 in fact, the\nquality of the student experience as\na whole \u2013 is a goal worthy of being\npursued for its own sake.\nIn any case, inflation-level\nincreases in tuition fees will not\naddress a fundamental problem at\nthe heart of the higher education\nsystem which the Green Paper does\nnot adequately discuss: high quality\nSTEMM (Science, Technology,\nEngineering, Mathematics, and\nMedicine) education costs more\nto deliver than education in other\nsubjects.\nThe College is committed to\ndelivering a high quality educational\nexperience for our students. This\nwill require additional income, but\nhigher fees are not the sole solution.\nThe support of Government as well\nas our corporate and individual\nsupporters is essential.\n...and the student\u2019s view\nLuke McCrone\nWriter\nT\noo many universities in\nEngland have allowed\nteaching to become a\n\u201cpoor cousin to research\u201d.\nThis was a quote from Universities\nMinister Jo Johnson. It seems\nthe government have responded\naccordingly to this dilemma.\nSo what is the Green Paper\nexactly? The Green Paper is a\ngovernmental document which\noutlines proposals to \u201creward\nexcellent teaching with reputational\nand financial incentives\u201d. There is\nno commitment to action; instead\nit acts as a tool used to simulate\ndiscussion.\nIt primarily aims to boost teaching\nstandards, support more people\n(from disadvantaged backgrounds)\ninto university and to give students\nbetter value for money from their\neducation.\nThe proposal is partly based\naround the notion that not all\nuniversities assign teaching the\nsame level of importance as\nresearch. High quality research is\ncurrently rewarded via the Research\nExcellence Framework (REF). The\ngovernment now aims to mimic\nthis concept by implementing the\nTeaching Excellence Framework \u2013\nrightfully so.\nDespite favouring this seemingly\ngreat reward system, we must\nscrutinise the implications of this\nproposal. The framework will act\nas a substantial measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s educational potential.\nIt will likely be used as a basis for\ndeciding league table positions.\nFrom the 2017/18 academic year, it\nwill even be used as a mechanism for\ngranting higher-ranked institutions\nthe ability to increase fees for new\nstudents.\nMr Johnson claimed that whilst\nmany academic institutions go\nabove and beyond, there are many\nthat opt for a \u201cdisengagement\ncontract\u201d.\nOn the one hand, it is likely that\nthe presence of stronger incentives\nfor excellent teaching will drive\nuniversities to optimise their own\nteaching potential. On the other\nhand, we must ask ourselves if\nthe additional fee income will\nexacerbate the gap between the\ncompetences of higher and lower\nranked universities.\nWill this fuel the creation of\nan elitist educational hierarchy\ncomprised of divided teaching-based and research-based\ninstitutions?\nIt seems the proposal is aiming\nto make the higher education\nsector increasingly marketable\nand accessible to a wider group\nof prospective students. Like any\nmarket fuelled by competition,there\nare winners and losers. Will we see\na rise in \u2018losing institutions\u2019 that\nstruggle to keep pace with it all?\nAnother defensive angle which\nMr Johnson employed during\ninterrogation of the proposal was\nthe need to compensate for a \u201cskills\nshortage and a skills mismatch\u201dwith\ngraduates entering the working\nworld. He felt that the proposal\nwould act as a robust solution for\nunfavourable graduate employment\nlevels. The question in response\nto this is quite simple: are we\nwitnessing a skills shortage, or a job\nshortage?\nStatistically, a growing population\nhas dictated an increasing level\nof purchased goods, services and\nbusiness start-ups meaning more\njobs. Some industries, including\nOil and Gas, are in particularly low\ndemand for graduate jobs currently.\nTherefore, both sides can be argued.\nInterestingly, it seems that the\ngovernment are inclined towards\nmanipulating the National Student\nSurvey (NSS) as an assessment basis\nfor the TEF. Therefore, the NSS\nwill likely have a greater bearing on\nthings than ever before.\nI personally feel this is where\nImperial College, as an established\nand capable institution, should\nreally start to up the ante. Imperial\u2019s\nNSS output (2% above the sector\naverage for student satisfaction in\n2015) is already remarkable and is\nonly getting better thanks to the\nhard work of many. Nonetheless, I\nbelieve the implementation of other\nNSS-related incentives for Imperial\nstudents would only improve the\nsituation. Introducing an interdepartmental prize specifically for\nthe most improved participation\nrate (compared to the previous\nacademic year) seems like a sound\noption, for example.\nThis would require the future\ncollaboration of the Deputy\nPresident of Education (student\nunion representative) with the\nLike any\nmarket\nfuelled by\ncompetition,\nthere are\nwinners and\nlosers\nIs there any point in protesting when fees for better degrees are so likely to rise? Photo Credit: Cale Tilford\nImperial education office and\nfaculty leadership to introduce such\na prize.\nI think it is imperative that we as\nstudents understand and respect the\nmain consequences of the Green\nPaper for us as young professionals\nentering the working world. One\nway of raising awareness is through\nthe effective communication of this\ninformation to the Imperial student\npopulation,provoking a well needed\ninterest in the subject.\nAnother way in which the Green\nPaper could significantly impact\nthe educational landscape is via the\nimplementation of the Grade Point\nAverage system. This will alter the\ncurrent \u2018degree band\u2019 scheme as we\nknow it. It would aim to support\nemployers in making recruitment\ndecisions,as well as helping students\nto track their progress throughout\nthe course duration, not just during\nexam period.\nThe proposals in the Green Paper\nhave huge scope to benefit many,\nincluding the under-privileged,\nyet it seems its modification to the\neducational landscape will provoke\ncontroversy. Are we witnessing\nan attempt to genuinely improve\nthe quality and accessibility of\nEnglish universities, or are we faced\nwith a framework within which\nuniversities will compete on every\nlevel in order to financially sustain\nthemselves?\nIt\u2019s time for you and I to address\nthe proposal and adapt to the\nchange.\nAre we about to witness the sculpting of a new higher educational landscape?\nThe\nproposed\nnew\nassessment\nframework\nrisks driving\nthe wrong\nbehaviour\nUniversities are going to change.

It\u2019s blunt physical\ncomedy.

Inking or marking skin\nunites cultures and continents\nacross the ages.\nUntil recently in the West,\ntattoos have been seen as a mark of\nbelonging to a counterculture. They\nare so subversive that in 1995 The\nNew York Times art critic Michael\nKimmelman likened tattoos to the\n\u2018art of the insane\u2019.\nHowever, now one in three\nadults in Britain has a tattoo.\nEven in ubiquity, tattoos remain\ncontroversial; a quick poll in the\nFELIX office revealed tattoos to\nbe variously \u2018hot\u2019 , akin to \u2018gangrene\u2019\nto \u2018putting people at risk of missing\na dermatological condition\u2019. No\nprizes for guessing the latter was the\nopinion of a medical student.\nTattoos when inked well and well\nplaced (collarbones are a personal\nfavourite) can be beautiful, but can\nthey be defined as fine art?\nPerhaps it depends on the artist;\nKate Moss is the proud owner of\ntwo swallows inked on the small of\nher back by Lucien Freud. She has\njoked that were she to graft the skin\nand put it up for auction she could\nearn herself a few million pounds.\nFine art institutions have\nalready started to capitalise on the\npopularity of tattoos. In May 2014,\nMus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, Paris,\nhosted 'Tatoueurs, Tatou\u00e9s', or\nTattooists, Tattooed, an exhibition\nwhich explored the history of body\nart.\nTattoos occupy the same space\nas graffiti in the world of art, the\nestablishment doesn\u2019t quite know\nwhat to do with it. Tattoos cannot\neasily be locked up in glass cases\nor bartered for; not yet at least,\nthough the Wellcome Collection\ndoes in fact have a collection of\npreserved tattooed skins. For most\nhowever, inking their skin remains\nthe ultimate expression of bodily\nautonomy; now as for centuries, a\nway of marking personal history.The\npain of the process becomes a ritual;\nit\u2019s permanence a statement of\nartistic intent, that the art changes,\nsagging, stretching, shifting with\nchanging skin is a bonus.\nTattoo by Kirsten Holliday,\nWonderland Tattoo, Portand, Oregon,\nUSA Photo Credit: Kirsten Holliday\nMaud Wagner, the first known female tattooist in the US 1911.

They consider capitalism a\ngame of chance: those born into\nriches generally prosper while those\nborn into poverty generally stay\nthere. They want to level out the\nplaying field so fewer people have to\nsuffer. They\u2019re sound principles, but\ndo the more specific political beliefs\nand actions of members of this\nmovement really embody them?\nIt is quite clear that a significant\nproportion of the hard-left has,\nA debate is\nnot won by\nmuting one\u2019s\nopponent\nin the past five years, become so\nobsessed with political correctness\nthat they are actively stifling free\nspeech.\nJust look at our universities, where\nyou would expect that free speech\nwould be protected at all cost.What\nkind of institution would want\nstudents to only hear things they\nagree with? Where does that get\nanyone?\nIn fact, there are dozens of\nsituations where free speech was\nsmothered by political correctness\nat even some of the best universities\nin the country.\nAt Oxford, for example, a debate\nabout the morality of abortion was\nshut down by 300 or so people on\nthe grounds that it was scheduled\nto be between two men. Since when\nwere debates only allowed to take\nplace between those directly affected\nby them? Would an infertile woman\nnot have been allowed to take part?\nElsewhere,Goldsmiths University\nSU voted against a measure to hold\ncommemorations for Holocaust\nMemorial Day because it would be\n\u201cEurocentric\u201dand wouldn\u2019t take into\naccount atrocities committed by the\nUK. Months later, Goldsmiths SU\nofficer Bahar Mustafa put together\na protest against inequality, with\nadvertisement saying \u201cIf you\u2019ve been\ninvited and you\u2019re a man and/or\nwhite PLEASE DON\u2019T COME.\u201d\nThis is obviously preposterous \u2013\nimagine seeing a flyer captioned\n\u201cWOMEN AND BLACKS NOT\nWELCOME.\u201d The culprit would\nlikely be kicked off their course.\nMeanwhile Bahar\u2019s defence, that\nminority women could not be racist,\nwas apparently sufficient.\nSatirical T-shirts depicting Jesus\nand Mohammed drinking beer\nwould have got an LSE Atheist\nsociety kicked out of their freshers\u2019\nfair had they not covered them up,\nas it was deemed offensive by LSE\u2019s\nstudent union, which would make\nblasphemy an offence.\nI\u2019m offended by loud breathers\nand people with BO but I wouldn\u2019t\ndream of petitioning for a ban on\nsuch things. While there\u2019s religion\nthere are people opposed to religion,\njust like with anything.\nI could go on to talk about how\nBirkbeck University have banned\nUKIP, 32 UK Universities have\nbanned magazines including Charlie\nHebdo, The Sun and The Star, UEA\nbanned a Mexican restaurant from\nhanding out sombreros because it\nrepresented \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019,\nhard left societies at a selection of\nuniversities have banned speakers\nincluding Maryam Namazie, Milo\nYiannopoulos, Germaine Grier,\nNigel Farage, David Willets, but I\nthink the point has been made.\nWhat these people are doing is\nsimply shutting down other people\u2019s\nopinions. If we disagree with people\nwe should surely invite them along\nin order to challenge their opinions.\nA debate is not won by muting\none\u2019s opponent. We\u2019re being denied\nthe opportunity to think and\nchallenge our opinions just because\na few people get offended. It\u2019s for\nthis reason that the proposition of\nbanning Donald Trump from the\nUK is ridiculous.\nA new term referring to these\nsocial justice warriors has been\nthrown around on social media by\nMilo Yiannopoulos was banned from Manchester SU because his views could\n\u201cincite hatred\u201d.

The\nRegressive Left doesn\u2019t dare criticise\nIslam because that would make\nthem \u2018Islamophobic\u2019.\nCriticising Islam will not hurt\nMuslims any more than criticising a\nscientific paper damages the paper \u2013\nit does the opposite.These people are\nwilling to be liberal about everything\nbut Islam. It is no surprise that\nthose on the far right are mocking\nthe hard-left\u2019s ridiculous behaviour:\nMilo Yiannopoulos ironically set\nup a college scholarship fund only\navailable to white men. It\u2019s worth\nmentioning that when he looked\ninto the statistics and found that\npoor white boys are in fact the\nmost under-represented group in\nuniversities in the UK and US, he\ndecided to make this fund a real\nthing. Of course, the hard-left\nexploded.\nThe bottom line is we need to chill.\nOpen debate is what we\u2019re here for.\nWe can\u2019t purge our lives of anything\nthat\u2019ll make us question our beliefs,\nas considering the opinions of\nothers is how we grow.\n\n"

Cancer is a beast that is\nlikely to haunt most of us directly\nor indirectly throughout our lives.\nThe sheer power of the word cancer\nmakes it a hard subject to discuss\nand communicate. \u2018That Dragon,\nCancer\u2019 is the first (mainstream)\ngame to explore cancer and its\neffect on the families of sufferers; it\nportrays a difficult struggle between\nhope and despair, acknowledging\nthat we all react in different ways.\nWhile it is the story of one family\n\u2013 it\u2019s unfortunately a struggle that\nmany other parents will have to\nendure. It\u2019s definitely an emotional\ngame, however, it\u2019s affect on each\nplayer is likely to differ based on\ntheir own experiences and their\nability to imagine parenthood. I felt\nawful for Ryan and Amy, but having\na child feels like such a distant\nevent to me that there was some\nemotional disconnect. It still made\nme think how I might react if I was\never in the same situation, which\nis something I\u2019ve never wanted to\nconsider. It\u2019s clear that Ryan and\nAmy react differently to their son\u2019s\ncancer. Amy is full of hope and faith\nin God, while Ryan despairs. These\ntwo opposing ideas become central\nthemes of the narrative. If you don\u2019t\nhave children this is a game worth\nplaying. If you\u2019ve been through the\nsame ordeal as the Greens it might\nbe comforting. For everyone else\nThat Dragon, Cancer might just be\ntoo depressing.\nbeautiful, with murky dreamscapes\nand dark tree like structures\nhaunting the landscape (which act\nas the physical representation of\ncancer in the game).\nModern games rarely make us\nthink; we play them to escape the\nreal world, to take part in fantastical\nexperiences that would otherwise\nbe impossible. So why is there a\ngrowing trend of indie developers\ncreating games about their own\nlives? There\u2019s been a (not so)\nsudden realisation that a medium\nwhere you can actually control and\ninteract with the world is probably\nthe best medium to relay personal\nexperiences. And it\u2019s likely that\nvirtual reality will enhance these\nsort of games even further. Gamers\neverywhere should welcome this\ngrowing category.\nHowever, there is still some\nresistance to games like That\nDragon, Cancer; many question\nif they should really be called\ngames. Personally, I don\u2019t think this\nquestion needs to be answered; we\ndon\u2019t need another category of art.\nThis sometimes divisive reaction\nindicates that the art form is still\nmaturing \u2013 when compared to\nbooks and film, games are still in\ntheir infancy.\nWe shouldn\u2019t judge games by their\nability to make us cry or scream.\nEvoking such extreme reactions\nis relatively easy. It\u2019s the complex,\nsubtle emotions that a player feels\nthat make That Dragon, Cancer\nso powerful. It\u2019s not a game that\ndemands introspection, but by its\nend you\u2019ll look back at your own\nlife and question how you might\nrespond in the same situation.\nThat Dragon, Cancer is out\nnow on Steam\nNuminous Games\u2019 debut adventure is great, but you probably shouldn\u2019t play it\nModern\ngames rarely\nmake us\nthink;\nwe play them\nto escape the\nreal world\nThe presentation of a narrative\ndriven game is always important.It\u2019s\nobvious that a long time has been\nspent making the game flawless in\nthis respect.To make the game even\nmore personal, the Green family\nprovide the voice acting themselves.\nThey narrate scenes and read out\nletters placed throughout the world\nwith emotional performances.\nThe abstracted polygonal world is\n\n"

Candidate manifestos have\nto be uploaded by 5pm the next day,\nor you risk relying on just your face\nto get that post.\nTurnout last year was 42% (60%\nundergraduates, 22% post grads).\nSince rules changed before the\nelections last year, every club with\nmore than 150 members has to\nhave its election online within the\nunion\u2019s eVoting system, rather than\nin person at an AGM.\nConstituent unions will vote for\ntheir presidents, clubs with more\nthan 150 members will vote in\ntheir committees and everyone will\nvote in the various volunteer roles\nwithin the union, including the\nrepresentation officers (Disabilities,\nCampaigns, Gender Equality etc).\nSeveral sabbatical officers, who\nwill take a year out of real life to\ndebate student issues, will also be\nelected. These positions are open\nto any current student, regardless\nof experience, and offer the chance\nto sit on the trustee board, making\nreal decisions for the future of\nImperial\u2019s student union. They get\npaid a tasty \u00a319 grand a year plus\nfree accomodation in their choice of\nhalls.\nPositions on the trustee board\nare also open to students who don\u2019t\nwant to take a year out.Two student\ntrustees are elected, and get to sit\non the board, making those big\ndecisions, whilst still plowing on\nwith their degrees.\nIf you prefer the anarchy of union\ncouncil, you could go up for council\nchair, another part time elected\nposition. This person gets the final\nsay over the (sometimes not even\nquorate) rabble of students who\ndebate the issues over at union\ncouncil once a month.\nThey get\npaid a tasty\n\u00a319 grand a\nyear plus free\naccomodation\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nBusiness school Dean sticks up for Bitcoin\nThe dean spoke out on the economic fad dividing the internet in City A.M.\nT\nhe dean of Imperial\u2019s\nBusiness School\npublished an article in\nMonday\u2019s edition of\nCity A.M. bemoaning the finance\nindustry\u2019s complacency when\nit came to Bitcoin, and other\ncryptocurrencies.\nUsing the example of Sony\ncomplacent attitude to MP3, which\nallowed Apple to sweep in and take\nadvantage, Professor G. \u2018Anand\u2019\nAnandalingam warned that big\nbanks, like Barclays, that have been\nclosing the accounts of customers\nwith dealing in Bitcoin, are at risk\nof losing out.\nLast year, a British teen\u2019s Barclays\naccount was closed with little\nexplanation after he\u2019d dabbled in\nthe Bitcoin trade, and the incident\nwas not isolated.\nThe Dean went on to describe the\nmerits of Bitcoin, saying that big\nbusiness should stop seeing it as\ncurrency used by those on the dark\nweb and embrace the speed it can\nbring to electronic transactions.\nHaving mentioned Imperial\u2019s own\n\u201cdigital money startup\u201d,Yoyo,he also\nused the article to plug Imperial\u2019s\nsymposium on the subject, brought\nto you by Citi bank. The event, held\nat Canary Wharf on Tuesday, also\ngave the Dean the opportunity to\nannounce the founding of a new\nCentre for Global Finance and\nTechnology at the Business School.\nThe centre will be headed up by\nProfessor Andrei Kirilenko, who\nhas previously worked for the US\ngovernment\u2019s Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission and MIT\u2019s\nSchool of Management.\nAnandalingam unsurprisingly\nhailed Citi as one of the few banks\nthat had moved with the times\nand embraced the new financial\ntechnology, or \u2018fintech\u2019.\nBitcoin was started with the\naim of decentralising a currency,\nso it wasn\u2019t in control of banks\nor governments, but rather by\ntraceable network of users online.\nRecently, the system has struggled\nto deal with technical issues.Bitcoin\ndeveloper Mike Hearn recently said\nthat \u201cthe community [of Bitcoin]\nhad failed\u201d, that it was \u201ccompletely\ncontrolled by a handful of people\u201d\nand that the network was on the\n\u201cbrink of technical collapse\u201d.\nGRACE RAHMAN Can\u2019t get out of it now!

After putting\nout several arguably\n\u2018Oscar-worthy\u2019 performances\nLeonardo DiCaprio may finally be\nawarded his long awaited and joked-about Oscar. We have Alejandro G.\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu and The Revenant to thank\nfor this. However, whilst DiCaprio\nis the most famous repeat snub\u00e9e\nthe Academy has a history of some\nseriously massive blunders (*cough*\nChicago). Let\u2019s look at some other\nexamples:\nAndy Serkis\nIt\u2019s an interesting debate when\nyou think about it. Can/should an\nactor portraying a 100% computer-generated character be recognised\nby the Academy? It\u2019s an interesting\ndebate when you think about it.\nShould the Oscar not go to the\nanimators? Ultimately, with the\nadvancing precision of technology I\nthink that acting as a CG character\nshould be considered just as\nlegitimate as \u2018real-life\u2019performances.\nMany people seemingly agree both\nwith this since, in 2011, thousands\npetitioned a nomination for Serkis\u2019\nrole in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\nKeep up with the times guys.\nTilda Swinton\nOK, before you say it, yes we all\nknow she already has an Oscar. The\nissue here is that in a world where\nBradley Cooper has been nominated\nthree times (Holy sweet lord Jesus,\nhow can anyone like American Hustle\nor American Sniper?) the fact that\nTilda Swinton has only ever been\nnominated once is getting more\nand more ridiculous. In my opinion,\nthe snub for her portrayal of Eva in\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin is the\nstand-out example of pure injustice.\nJamie Foxx\nI don\u2019t normally do this but let\u2019s\nkeep this bullet point-level simple:\nDjango Unchained is a phenomenal\nfilm; Jamie Foxx is perfect in it. Les\nMis\u00e9rables is a terrible film; Hugh\nJackman\u2019s performance in it was\nawful. Somebody go back to 2013\nand swap these nominations. Thank\nyou.\nBEN COLLIER\nThe Suicide Squad trailer is not okay\nW\nhen it comes to\nthe shortcomings\nof Marvel or DC\u2019s\ncinematic output,\nas a self-confessed comic book fan-boy, I\u2019m usually pretty forgiving.\nUnfortunately,the first official trailer\nfor DC\u2019s latest film, Suicide Squad,\nwhich dropped last week, hints at\na film with some serious flaws. It\nmight only be a two-minute trailer,\nbut the way it trivialises mental\nhealth and sexualises its female cast\nhas me worried for its release this\nAugust.\nIt begins by introducing the main\nvillains who make up the \u2018Suicide\nSquad\u2019 \u2013 a group of \u2018the most\ndangerous people on the planet\u2019\nforced to work for the government\non impossible missions. Military\nofficer Rick Flag, played by Joel\nKinnaman, narrates the trailer,\ndescribing each of his fellow squad\nmembers as they appear on screen:\n\u201cGuy who shoots people. He\u2019s a\ncrocodile and he eats people. Burns\npeople.You\u2019re possessed by a witch.\u201d\nAt this point, Harley Quinn (played\nby Margot Robbie) appears on\nscreen: \u201cAnd she\u2019s just crazy.\u201d\nBy defining Quinn by her mental\nstate, the filmmakers potentially\nwaste a complex and powerful\nfemale character. The scene that\nfollows is even worse, in which she\nhears voices and jokingly remarks\nto the military force surrounding\nuniverse. In one part, the Joker is\nseen holding her in a toxic pool, a\nscene that can also be found in her\nlatest comic origins tale, in which\nshe is forced to become the Joker\u2019s\nlover and side-kick, against her own\nfree will.It\u2019s a story that is not in any\nway empowering. At one point she\neven wears a jacket with the words\n\u2018Property of the Joker\u2019 embroidered\non the back, further evidence that\nthe film will present Quinn as an\nobject under the Joker\u2019s control.\nThe problems with her costume\ndon\u2019t end there: along with the rest\nof the female cast, she\u2019s blatantly\nsexualised, wearing underwear\nwhilst her male cohorts are covered\nin layers of protective clothing.\nWhile these issues alone are\ntroubling, what is more worrying\nis that \u2013 as a major blockbuster\n\u2013 the film is unlikely to start a\nconversation about suicide or mental\nhealth. As the world is starting to\nwake up to the seriousness of these\nissues, it\u2019s disappointing that the\nmovie is being advertised in a way\nthat fetishises criminals and mental\nhealth patients.Now all we can do is\nwait and hope that the film is more\nnuanced than its trailer.\nCALE TILFORD\nher: \u201cWhat was that? I should\nkill everyone and escape? Sorry.\nThe voices. Haha, I\u2019m kidding.\nThat\u2019s not what they really said.\u201d\nWell done lads, you just trivialised\nauditory hallucinations, a common\nsymptom of certain mental illnesses,\nfor comedic effect. It\u2019s important\nto remember that Suicide Squad\nmarks the live-action cinematic\ndebut of Harley Quinn, and for\nmany this might be their first \u2013 and\nmost lasting \u2013 introduction to the\ncharacter.\nFurther analysis of the trailer\nhints at Harley Quinn\u2019s supervillain\norigins in the DC cinematic\nThe most romantic film themes\nof all time\nHenry Mancini\u2019s \u201cMoon\nRiver\u201d, from Breakfast at\nTiffany\u2019s (1961)\nThere are three versions of this\nsong in the film adaptation of\nTruman Capote\u2019s acclaimed novel:\na choral version, an instrumental\nversion, and one performed during\nthe film by the amazing Audrey\nHepburn on her guitar during the\nfilm. All three are dreamy and full\nof hope, perfectly illustrating Holly\nGolightly\u2019s spirit.\nMichel Legrand\u2019s\n\u201cLes Parapluies de\nCherbourg\u201d, from Les\nParapluies de Cherbourg\n(1964)\nThe touching music of Michel\nLegrand is more than a mere\ncompanion for Jacques Demy\u2019s\nfilm, considering the fact that in\nthe whole film there is not even\none word of spoken dialogue;\nall dialogues are sung on top of\nLegrand\u2019s compositions,which were\nalso responsible for establishing his\ntalent in Hollywood.\nNino Rota\u2019s \u201cLove\nTheme\u201d, from Romeo\nand Juliet (1968)\nIn quite possibly the best film\nadaptation of the most famous love\nstory of all time,Nino Rota achieves\na masterpiece, full of drama, along\nwith the a perfect medieval tone\nthat perfectly suits the setting of the\nstory.\nEnnio Morricone\u2019s \u201cTema\nd\u2019Amore\u201d, from Cinema\nParadiso (1988)\nThe Maestro\u2019s music was essential\nin making Giuseppe Tornatore\u2019s\nCinema Paradiso the classic film\nmasterpiece it is today. This track\nperfectly captures Toto\u2019s young, all-consuming love for Elena, with the\nnecessary shades of melancholy and\nnostalgia that perfectly complement\ntheir story.\nIOANNA MORIANOU\nMargot Robbie as Harley Quinn, whose character seems to be overly sexualised.

Photo Credit: Cale Tilford\nO\nver the last few years,\nSOPHIE (the stage\nname of Samuel Long)\nhas played many times\nin London and around the world.\nI\u2019ve been lucky enough to see\nhim twice. This time he played\nat Village Underground, one of\nLondon\u2019s most hip venues. With\neach successive live performance\nhe has debuted new material to the\naudience and each time a new song\nis debuted the reaction is the same:\npure unadulterated joy.\nThe hyper-consumerist (yes, his\ndebut album is called PRODUCT)\nnature of SOPHIE\u2019s music and\naesthetic means that nearly every\nsong he\u2019s produced is calculated\nand refined to be addictive and\nengaging. He reels his audience\nin with obscure, yet oddly familiar\nsounds. His use and appropriation\nof these is most obvious on his\nrecent collaboration, \u2018Let\u2019s Ride\u2019\nwith Charli XCX \u2013 he mixes her\nvocal onomatopoeia such as \u2018beep\nbeep\u2019 and \u2018vroom vroom\u2019 with the\nsounds themselves. When Long\nplays this live, the crowd almost\nlaughs each time they hear the\nsounds of the car. Most people are\nThere were times when the\naudience\u2019s enthusiasm seemed to\nfizzle out \u2013 when Long played\ntracks that weren\u2019t from his recent\nrelease PRODUCT or other\ncollaborations, but these moments\nnever lasted long.\nThe rest of the PC Music crew\n(including A.G. Cooke, Danny\nL Harle and GFOTY) were all\nin attendance. To an outsider (and\nto nearly everyone else in the\naudience) they were inconspicuous\n\u2013 they looked like every other ironic\nhipster in the crowd. None of them\nhave really seen the same success as\nSOPHIE (although GFOTY will\nbe supporting Animal Collective\non a number of tour dates later this\nyear).They too were probably in awe\nand will want to emulate his simple\nyet iconic live performance.\nThe set ended with \u2018When I\nRule The World\u2019 by LIZ, a song\nproduced by SOPHIE last year.\nLIZ sings \u201cYou should do as I say\ncause things are gonna be my way.\u201d\nAt the moment, Samuel Long and\nthe rest of PC Music might have\nI\nn interviews, Savages have\nalways described themselves\nas a live band: \u201cyou don\u2019t\nunderstand who we are unless\nyou see us play live.\u201d They aim to\ncreate a reaction with their live act,\nsomething more than static head\nbobbing. Watching the video for\n\u2018The Answer,\u2019 the first song on their\nnew album Adore Life, you might\nexpect a Savages gig to be a messy,\nexplosive affair. I expect it might be\nif it wasn\u2019t at 8:45 in the morning.\nThe idea of a gig before work,\nwithout alcohol, is a weird one. But\nreplacing intoxication with a coffee\nhigh works surprisingly well.\nLead singer Jehnny Beth charms\neven at such an early time in the\nmorning. In between songs she\nconfidently sips her cup of tea to\nthe amusement of the crowd. Her\nperformance throughout the set\nis sublime; those at the front were\ngraced by her presence. At times\nshe reaches towards members of\nthe crowd, holds their shoulder\nby Beth\u2019s presence. The rest of the\nband are more subdued, probably in\nneed of a few more hours in bed.\nTheir latest album is brilliant by\nitself, I didn\u2019t expect it to gain much\nfrom a live setting, but it does \u2013 and\nI implore anyone to see Savages on\ntheir upcoming world tour.

How do we\nfix it? When is everyone,\nincluding myself, going\nto shut up about it? Probably not\nfor a while. And yes, I do realise\nthat I could begin sounding like\na broken record, considering this\nis the third piece I\u2019ve written for\nFELIX discussing the topic, but\nunfortunately the problem isn\u2019t\ndisappearing so neither will the\nanalogous articles. Things are\nabout to get a bit gross and very\ncomplicated.\nFollowing the increased publicity\naround three high profile sexual\nharassment cases in US university\nscience departments, democratic\nlawmaker Jackie Speier is proposing\nto Congress the strengthening of\nexisting federal discrimination laws\nin order to tackle the issue at hand.\nAlthough the exact details haven\u2019t\nbeen finalised, Speier has made\nit clear that the system needs to\nchange and people should be held\naccountable.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like the\nCatholic Church, where once there\nwas an establishment of paedophilia,\nthey just move the priest to another\nparish\u201d, Speier told reporters.\nHowever, the proposed changes\nare not unanimously supported and\nsome argue that the actual impact\nof these changes will never trickle\ndown to the lab level. Many states\nhave laws that explicitly prevent\nthe sharing of employee personal\nrecords between Universities, which\nare themselves constantly under\nthreat of lawsuits. However, what\nis clear to most people is that the\ncurrent academic set up is untenable.\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t been\nkeeping up with these cases, which\nis understandable considering the\nwhole thing is pretty depressing,\nhere is a short synopsis. In a 2005\ninvestigation recently released by\ncongresswoman Speier, Arizona\nUniversity unveiled that lead\nastronomer Timothy Slater created\na workplace environment that\ninvolved lunchtime trips to a strip\nclub, demeaning comments to\nfemale co-workers,and open leering\nat female undergraduates. The\ncondemning report was released on\nthe same day it was reported that\na Caltech astronomer, Christian\nOtt, had harassed and fired two\nundergraduates from his lab after\nthey filed a complaint against him.\nThe whole situation turned into a\nmassive scandal, partly because just\nthree months earlier, a prominent\nastronomer from the University of\nArizona, Geoff Marcy, was found\nguilty of sexually harassing female\nco-workers.\nIf social media is anything to go\nby, unfortunately these cases are\nonly part of a wider trend. These\nhigh profile examples of sexism and\nsexual harassment have triggered\nthe formation of a new hashtag,\n#astroSH, which is being used\nby scientists to share stories and\nvoice opinions on the reality of\nbeing a woman in STEM, with\nemphasis on Astronomy. Such\noutcry has prompted institutes\nlike NASA to put out statements\nreinforcing its commitment to\ninclusivity. Administrator Charles\nBolden stated, \u201cLet me be perfectly\nclear: NASA does not tolerate\nsexual harassment, nor does any\norganization seriously committed\nto workplace equality, diversity and\ninclusion.\u201d Strong and encouraging\nwords,but some argue that although\nscientific institutions wholly\ncondemn sexism, there are no\nconsequences for those who unfairly\ndiscriminate against women.\nThe worrying part of both the\nofficial and anecdotal cases is\nthe general lack of repercussions\nfaced by most of these individuals.\nAlthough the report about Timothy\nSlater is damning to say the least, he\nwas allowed to stay at the University\nof Arizona until 2008 and now\nholds a science education chair\nposition in the state of Wyoming.\nGeoff Marcy, the professor from the\nUniversity of California has been\nallowed to continue calling himself\nthe honorary title of \u201cProfessor\nEmeritus\u201d since he technically\nchose to step down amidst\nwidespread criticism, rather than\nbeing fired. Ott was never fired and\nCalTech allowed him to continue\nto work with undergraduates.\nThis unaccountability has created\na culture where victims of\ndiscrimination don\u2019t feel able to #AstroSH \u2013 hashtag to voice the reality of sexual harassment in STEM.\nreport the harassment. A series of\narticles recently published by Forbes\ncalled \u201cDeciding whether to report\nharassment in science\u201d demonstrate\nthat many cases don\u2019t move through\nofficial channels because of a\ntendency to sweep the indiscretions\nof important professors under the\nrug.\nSo you can see how the whole\nthing is a bit of a mess and the\nscientific community is once more\nstuck, knowing action is needed,\nbut remaining indecisive as to what\nthat action should be taken. Just to\nclarify, no one is saying that all male\nscientists are sexist, chauvinistic\npigs or that work place harassment\nis unique to STEM fields or only\nGeoff Marcy was found guilty of sexual harassment. Photo Credit: Wikipedia\ntowards women in STEM. The fact\nthat the problem is so hard to tackle\nseems to generally be the result\nof sexism, racism, homophobia\nand other general unpleasantness\nbeing prevalent within society and\nsubsequently academia. But, science\nat its best doesn\u2019t lead from behind\nnor does it sit on its hands waiting\nfor the world to catch up. Personally\nI\u2019d love for this problem to go away,\nif for no other reason, just so that\nI can write articles about literally\nanything else at this point.\nIt\u2019s absurd and deeply worrying,\nthat for a bunch of supposedly\nsmart people, we still struggle with\ntackling what should be a simple\nissue.\nJackie Speier fights to tackle the current sexual harassment issues and the lack of\nrepercussions.

Whether\nthat be through the failure of our\ndemocratically-elected leaders or\nthe failure of a society so repelled\nby the idea of change that creating\nand propagating our own suffering\nhas become as natural to us as the\nhappiness we all crave.\nWhen I think about this, I think\nabout the millions of LGBT youth\nacross the world, struggling to deal\nwith who they are, and who they\nlove, all while in the midst of a\nworld so ferociously hostile towards\nthem. To be so unapologetically\ncruel to these kids is to play with\n\ufb01re. Subjecting them to further\nmental stress is to tempt fate, and\nWe are the\nvictims of\nour own\ndelusions of\ngrandeur\nThere is\nsuch a\nthirst to\nbe \u2018happy\u2019\nand to find\n\u2018happiness\u2019\nOur obsession with appearing successful prevents us from reaching out for help,\nor from offering it to others. Photo Credit: Hercampus.com\nit is my belief that fate will oblige,\nshould it be tempted so.\nBlood stains are what we are left\nwith when we are so torturous to\nthose who are so innocent,especially\nwhen it comes to those struggling\nwith their sexuality.\nWith this in mind, it is important\nto remember humans are a self-destructive species, and the tendrils\nof this self-destruction are far-reaching. When we so brazenly\nelevate our achievements and\ncon\ufb02ate our intelligence with\nuntouchability, it is no wonder\nthat we are the victims of our own\ndelusions of grandeur.\nSo little is known about the brain,\nso to me, it is sadly poetic that it is\nsubject to such underestimation.The\nsame brain which has built a fully-functioning, orbiting space station\nhas also justi\ufb01ed the slaughter of\ngay men by throwing them from\natop buildings in towns in Syria. It\nis obvious that its capabilities are all\nat once amazing, and terrifying.\nWe have all experienced the\njoy of a society which utilises the\nstrengths of our collective intellect.\nIt is, therefore, a mystery to me\nto see a society stigmatise mental\nhealth so viciously. We are as much\nat the mercy of our minds as we are\nthe masters of it. To so easily cast\nmental illnesses into the shadows\nis both arrogant and extremely\ndangerous.\nThat being said, it is somewhat\nunderstandable for there to be a\nlack of engagement with mental\nhealth. It is easier to sympathise\nwith someone who has a broken\nleg than a broken soul. But to be so\ncallous as to force the people around\nus into a veritable state of hiding is\nmorally reprehensible. One in four\npeople in the UK will experience a\nmental health problem each year, so\nit seems the shadows are \ufb01lled with\nsuffering souls.\nI believe mental illnesses are tied\nto an intangible vulnerability that\npeople fear so deeply.There is such a\ndesperation for every single one of us\nto be the absolute best of ourselves,\nto be successful and to achieve, and\nto ful\ufb01l our potential, God-given\nor otherwise. There is such a thirst\nto be \u2018happy\u2019 and to \ufb01nd \u2018happiness\u2019\nand I think, all things considered,\nour desires are misplaced. We are\nso concerned with \ufb01nding our own\nperfection that we forget to be\nhuman.These attitudes fuel our own\nprejudice towards mental illnesses.\nHowever, I think bigotry and\nprejudice are more of the heart,\nthan of the mind. To overcome our\nprejudices we must put our hearts\n\ufb01rst.\nTo approach issues in this way can\nbe so rewarding and so pivotal in\nshaping the views of a wider society.\nWhether that be a Priest who\nspeaks out in support of same-sex\nmarriage, or a mother who accepts\nher son\u2019s sexuality as part of who he\nis, by using our hearts we can create\na more positive environment for the\nmost vulnerable amongst us.\nI have made a conscious focus on\nLGBT youth in this article because\nit is of personal importance to me,\nbut my message can be applied\nto anyone and everyone. While\neducation and more comprehensive\nmental healthcare will go a long\nway in helping those who suffer so\nneedlessly, on an individual level\nwe must all do more to help those\naround us, and we must lead with\nour hearts in doing so.\nIt is because our brains are so\nbrilliant that we should be vigilant\nand supportive should things go\nwrong. Vulnerability should be\nembraced, our \ufb02aws should be\nembraced, and ultimately our\nweaknesses should be embraced.\nOnly then can our own mental\nhealth be seen as health just as a\nbroken leg or a stomach bug.\nOur minds are as fragile as they\nare wonderful, and there is a \ufb01ne\nline that separates us from that\nfragility.\nI think, in the end, we are all lost.\nBut it is better to be lost with the\nones we love than to be lost alone.\nThe figures speak for themselves.
