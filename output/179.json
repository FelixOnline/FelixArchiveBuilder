All the Union officers,\nfrom the President down are\nrushing about, trying to find\nout \\exactly what it is that\nthey are supposed to be org-an ising, and attempting to do\nsame. All this under the\nstrain imposed by the sheer\nnumbers of fresher s, who\nmake up over 40 p.c. of the\nCollege this year. Perhaps,\nit would be an idea to change\nAdministrations at Easter so\nas to give the new officers the\nwh ble of Ithe 'summer Term\nto prepare for the New Session.\nHow do the fresher s find\nthe College? The official re-ce pti on, as official (functions\noften do, may have been a little boring, especially for the\npost-graduate freshmen. The\nUnion Officers had little to add\nto what was already in the\nBlue Book and in FELIX, but\nthey took their time saying it\nHoiw many fresher s,I won-der, have accepted the President's invitation to meet him\nin the Union Office. They\nwould be lucky indeed to find\nhim there, and luckier still to\nreceive a help ul response from\nthe other occupants of this\ndouble doo red sanctuary.\nForutnately not many freshmen have attempted to invade\nthe Union Office; the little\nspa j rei fene they do have is\nspent queuing for a meal in\nthe refectories. The temporary refectory system seems to\nbe sorting itself ont, though\nthere is a suspicion that th p landlord of 'The Queen' is th t. principal beneficiary \u2022 of the\n'Seafood Plan'.\nDo women like IC? This\nmay appa er to be a silly question in view of the large numbers turned away from the\nSaturday Hops, but what does\nI CW A think about the fe-males' position in the College?\nAnd why has there been a drop\nin the number of female students at IC this year? Could\nit be that women do not want\nto come to IC, that they have\nheard that we are a college, of\nbeer drinking louts, where wo-m(e.n are 'seem (or should I say stared at) but never heard\nand generally ignored? Let's face it, the general attitude to\nICWAri'ans in the Union\neaves much to be desired. It\n.s not improper to smile at a woman whom you meet every\nday, to open a door for a woman who crosses your path\nm> the Union. A bit- more\nchivalry about the place will\ndo much to improve our re-put ation. In the field of sports it looks\nas if - we were , set for another\ngood year.

EK MAN In January 1962 the three\nauthors of this article conceived the idea of an Imperial College mountaineering und\nscientific expedition in the,\nsummer of 1963, and after\npublic ising the idea though out College a group was formed\nto carry out detailed planning\nfor such a project. Eight\nmonths later the decision to\nabandon the expedition was\nforced on the organisers because of the complete refusal\nOf the College Exploration\nBoard to assist or encourage\nthe expedition in any respect,\nfinancial or otherwise. This\naccount of the event which\nled to this decision is presented\nin the hope that it will encourage the Exploration Board\nto give a clear statement of\nthe policies which guide its\ndecisions.\nThe proposals were for an\nexpedition, including seven\nmembers of the College with\nan external leader and doctor,\nto be sent to the Karakoram\n(Pakistan) in June 1963. In\nthe final arrangements the expedition was to be led by Mr. Chris Bdnnington. with Dr. Jim Swallow as medical of-fic er, both having Himalayan\nexperience and both being\nExpedition to Jan Mayen, 1963\nIt is intended to mount\nanother expedition to Jan\nMayen Island in the summer\nof 1963.

Its aim is to continue\nand extend the studies carried\nout by Imeprial College parties in 1938, 1959 and 1961.\nThe main work of the expedition will again be gla cio logie al, but extensive botanical\nand geological programmes will\nalso be carried out. An interesting archeological problem\nalso awaits solution. The expedition will take twelve men,\nseven of whom have been\nchosen.

President Chris Liddle\nand entourage entered the lecture theatre to a cornet fan-fare, and the meeting actually\nmanaged to start on time.\nThe first words spoken were\na request for clemency\u2014no to-mato es, eggs, or flour in view\nof the fact that the meeting\nwas in a new lecture theatre.\nThe routine business was\ncarried out, then the meeting\nwas informed that Dave Gilbert had 'donated a top hat\nand^-a6 ft long locomotive\nname plate to Guilds by letter\n(items not enclosed). In the\nah sence of the top hat, the\nPresident wore a Salvation\nArmy hat, which sae med to\nsuit him quite well. Some\nelections then took place, with\nonly one hitch\u2014a Chemical\nengineer almost being elected\nas the 1stye a i Aero. rep.\nThe new post of Publicly Officer finally went to Bob\nSchroter after a supporting\nspeech by the ex-President,\nLawrie Austin. The count\nwas interrupted by a display\nof oral gymnastics b v the VicePresident, John White, who\nhalf choked on several pieces\ndf ch n. fc which -Pound bl >;i.r way into his mouth. It was\nsuggested, however, that this\nwas ppt really a feat of\nmarksmanship, since one could\nhardly miss such a target.\nThe usual plugs were given\nfor Morphy Day, the Lord\nMayor's Show, Guilds-Mines\nCarnival, the Brighton car run,\netc. The Vice-President then\ngave a little talk about mascots\nand when Mitch was men-tio ned, lo and behold, there\nhe was under the table.

Blackett,\nHead of the Physics Department and Pro Rector of Imperial College, gave a lunchtime General Studies lecture\nto about 100 students on the\nsubject of \"Science, Technology and World Advancement\".\nIntroduced by the President\nof the Union, Asit Chandmal,\nProfessor Blackett said that\nthe second most important\nproblem facing the world today ; after the principal one of\nwhether or not the world can\navoid blowing itself to pieces,\nis that only a small proportion of the world's. population\nhas so far benefited from the\nadvances which science now\nmakes possible. He described\nthe two great sub-divisions of\nthe human race; the 400 mil-lion, living in Europe, \" Bri tain and her descendant co un tries; America, etc.-\", with an\naverage per capita income of\nabout \u00a3400 p..a., and the remaining 1,000 million with an\nincome of perhaps \u00a340 per\nhead per year. And the amazing fact is that this dichotomy has risen within the last\n150-200 years.\nThe standards of life in\nEurope and, say China, in the\n18th century are believed to\nby D. Bourne\nhave been about the same ; and\nit is certain that the standard\nof life at that time in either\nof those places was little higher than that in Ancient Rome.\nThe reason for the appearance\nof this phenomenal difference\njin wealth was the scientific\nrevolution; the wealth of those\ncountries involved in it soared,\nthat of the fathers remained\nsteady or even fell.\nProfessor Blackett went on\nto show the distinction between science, and tech-no logy. By2,000 B.C., craft technology had reached a level which was not surpassed\nin well over 3,000 years.\nSlides were shown of build-ing s,|ew ele ry and furniture\nof an extremely high standard,\nboth of design and execution;\na Mesopotamian temple perhaps 6,000 year old, very sophisticated jewelry made 4.500\nyears ago and a chair from\nTutenkamen's tomb, dating\nover 3,000 years. Of this lat-ter, Professor Blackett said he\nhad recently seen a close copy\nin an unspecified University\nHostel, where it looked not in\nthe least incongruous.\nA slide was shown which\ncompared drawings of two\ntread mih F opie rated cranes,\nsimilar in design, one predating the other by 1,600\nyears. This was a striking illustration of the static nature\nof ech no logy unaided by\nscience. The achievement of\nthe scientific revolution was\nto provide logical explanations\nfor much knowledge which had\nhitherto been of a purely empirical character, a and by enabling people to understand\nthe principles underlying this\nknowledge to suggest fresh approaches which in their turn\n, na de many Viery important\ninnovations possible. Only\ncountries whose social systems\nlooked more favourably on innovation especially those of\nWestern Europe, thus benefited from the advances made\npossible; countries of a more\nstatic nature; India and Chin?i, for example; were rapidly left\nbehind.\nAs for the future, Professor\nBlackett believes that it is vital we help those countries left\nbehind, both with money and\nwith skills. Apart from the\nmoral reasons, we must do so\nto help to support the democratic system (of government\nwhich many of these countries\nare trying. For if we do not,\nthey may well fall for the glittering but empty promises of\nCommunism. This would be\na disaster, for them as for us.\nIn answer to questions put\nto him, Professor Blacket said\nthat, while it was difficult to\nassess, he thought that on the\nwhole countries cd loni sed by\nBritain had benefitted more\nthan they had been harmed.\nHe also felt that the greatest\neducational need for the underdeveloped countries was for\nsecondary education, because\nit actually trained people to\ndo the most important job of\nall, namely to run the country,\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE COMMEMORATION DAY IN THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL Thursday25 th October19623 pm Special Visitor SIR KEITH MURRAY BSC, PHD, B LITT, MA, Chairman of the University Grants Committee.\nThe ceremony will be proceeded by a short service in Holy Trinity,\nChurch, Prince Consort Road, at which the preacher will be the\nRight Rev. and Right Ho n.R.W.

The additional space provided for the Various faculties was of interest to some, but undoubtedly, the most popular part of the dev elopement scheme is that dealing with the new Halls of Residence. Hall capacity a tI.C. has always lagged far behind demand and the result was showing up more and more in general lack of interest among students in Union feff airs. A small minority lived in Hall and were int\nim at ely concerned in the s running of the Union and the various College clubs and societies, while as far as the vast majority was concerned, IC was an extension of school, a9 to5 daily routine and then away to outside activities e lsw he m Of course it would bean oversimplification to state that student apathy was due sole\nly to living away from the College premises, but there has been a nagging suspicion always that an atmosphere of a close knit community could be created if only the Hall situation could be improved.1 This theory is very soon to\ng be put to the test. As the\nS photographs accompanying this\nf \u00a7 article show, we have come af \u00a7 long way since that day when\nS the first plans of the South\ng Halls were announced, and de-1 spite various hold-ups, the\n3 the first plans of the South Side\n= of Prince's Gardens is sched1uled to come into operation\n3 early in the new year. Once\ns completed, South Side will pro-| vi de hostel accommodation for\nH384 students plus a host of other\nS facilities.\n1 The hostel part of South\n3 Side will occupy the eight up-= per floors, the 'penthouse\nH suites' on the very top pr ovid H ing four flats for the four Wars dens. Four are required bell cause the hostel will for adS mini strat iver esa sons, be split\nj| up into four Halls, namely\n\u00a7 Selkirk, Falmouth, Tizard and\nKeogh Halls. The four Wardens will be Mr.C. C. Seaford,\nDr. K.E. Weale, Dr. A. Cameron, and Dr. J.B. Butler.\nThe two.Halls at the east end\nof the building will hold 120\nstudents each, while the west\nend ones will be somewhat\nsmaller, holding 72 students\neach, until such time as the\nadjoining leases expire, and the\nbuilding can be extended to\nits full length. The eight hostel floors are split horizontally\ninto two sets of three floors,\neach with its associated 'com-mun al floor' where there will\nbe such facilities as a laundry\n(equipped with Bendix mach-ines), a games room, a 'quiet'\nroom, possibly a commit te room and a galley for cooking.\nThe rooms in each three level\ntier are built on the Oxbridge\nstaircase model, being grouped\nround a succession of stair-mm\nA view along one of the\ncases, each landing opening onto eight rooms, with centrally\nplaced washroom and toilet\nfacilities.

If : \\\nAfter a long period of work and preparation, face-lifting\nand wall cleaning, the great day finally came, and the College opened its doors to an all time record number of clean, bright\ncheeked and best-dressed freshmen (and some fresh women too).\nEvery autumn there seems to be more and more of them and this\nyear was no exception. Official! figures have not yet been released,\nbut a good estimate is that the intake was of some thirteen hundred fresher s, of whom between five and six hundred were post-graduate. The number of postgraduates is always uncertain as\nmany of these come from overseas and often turn up at the last\nminute, but in general, an increase of from 5 to 10% is expected\nin all round numbers.\nThe President addresses freshmen.\nThe day started with seperate reception for post- and un.\nder-graduates, at which freshmen were addressed by\nthe Rector, members of\nthe Academic staff and\nUnion Officers. The Rector gave some details of the\nCollege rebuilding scheme, an\nidea of what the College stood\nfor in the field of Science and\nTechnology, and some good advice about Union activities\n(\"Don't join all 80 clubs, no\nmatter how high-pressure their\nrecruiting, methods'-').

KN I71080177 New Books\nSecondhand Books\nPaperbacks.\n...and now\nGramophone Records.\nfar as the the one day rail\nstrike was concerned, the Rector\nsuggested a revised version of\nthat famous motto; 'the College never closes'.\nThe Student Officers followed\nthis with a somewhat more\nlighthearted approach, suggesting among other things a high\nfailure rae e( one in three)\nand a high rate of loss of bach-el or hood. This latter is in the\nnature of an occupational hazard for members of the Royal\nCollege of Science, as the vast\nmajority of our young ladies\nseem to prefer pure science to\nengineering.\nThe reception was followed\nby a buffet lunch, and the fresher s were then fct loose in the\nUnion Building\" and left to the\nmercy of the College Clubs\nand Societies, which judging\nby advance reports, made the\nmost of the opportunity to get\nnew blood. Not only the Rugby, Soccer and Boat Clubs, but\nalso such Societies as the RCS Literary Society attracted\nlarge numbers.\nWhat the wastage rate will\nbe is somewhat uncertain, but ,\nit seems like \u2022 being a record\nyear.\nROYAL B0OMALAKA\n(Now It can be told.)\nThe visit to Silwood by the first year Ciyils for the annual two\nweek imbibing session, cunningly disguised under the name of\n'fid d course', always causes quite a stir in the neighbourhood,\nbut this year, a nipple from the local stir went even further.\nIt' was discovered that a Royal Entourage left Windsor Castle every day, and\npassed along part of the Silwood Park boundary on its way\nto the Ascot race course. Accordingly a trusty ' band of\nabout 40 engineers, led by their\nredoubtable chief, Pete Griffiths (who wishes to' remain\nan on v mou s) collected at a suitable spot\" on the road used\nby the said cavalcade. A small setback was encountered,\nin the shape of a large photo-graph er, who finding a large\ncollection of assorted cream of\nBritish youth occupying what\nhe claimed to be his pitch, became so incensed that he\nthreaten end the scruffiest pre-sent, one Rd Jn s, with\nviolence. Discreet glowering s and muttering, however, caused\nhim to desist.\nThe approach of the Royal\nparty was heralded by two\nmo far cvc le patrolmen, :wi ho would not have looked out of\nplace in an Al Capone film,\none of them coming close to\nrunning over the toes of the\nunfortunate engineer whose\nfoot just overhung the grass\nverge. Immediately behind\nthem came an open landau\ncontaining the Queen and\nPince Phillip. With beautifully precise timing, Mr. P. Griffiths led a lusty Boomalaka, which reached a climax\njust as the landau was along-side. The cheering completely drowned the welcoming cries\nof the local villagers, and unfortunately caused one the\nliveried mounted outriders to\nloose his passive mark of indifference as his horse bolted\nup the he f lge copse1. Apart\nfrom this, the Boomalaka was\nwarmly received, Prince Phillip and Lord Snowdon smiling and waving.\nShattered by their vocal ef-forts, the temporary residents\nof Silwood staggered back to\na local hostelry to re-lubricate\ntheir vocal cords.\n\n"

There\nseems to be no corresponding\ndifficulty in the financing of\na succession of major arctic\nexpedition, the despatch ot\nwhich would appear to have\nbecome an annual event,\nwhile on the other hand the\nBoard has not supported a mountaineering and scientific\nexpedition since 1959.\nEven accepting the Board's contention that its financial\nsituation is weak, it must have\nbeen evident that the proposed\nKarakoram Expedition, con.\nside ring the support it was receiving from outside College,\nwould have stood a very good\nchance of going out in subst an J ti ally the same form (at the ex. *\npens e of an increased organ is \u00bb\nat ional effort), given the en- J courage ment of the Board and }\na reduced grant. However, the '\nBoard refused the organisers >\neven formal approval, and dis- j put ed the uae of the words j \"Imperial College\" in the Ex>pedition name. This amounts, t in effect, to a veto of the pro- !\nj ect as no outside body will ;\nsupport a College Expedition ;\nwhich is disowned by the College Exploration Board.\nThis sequence of event contrasts strangely with the prescribed objects of the Board\n\"to encourage initiative on the\npart of all members of the Un ion in organising scientific ex-p editions\". It was an expedition originating from Mountaineering\nClub circles to the Karakoram\nwhich led directly to the formation of the Exploration\nBoard in 1955. Are such activities to be excluded in future\nfrom the scope of the Board's work? if this is the case should\nnot the Board make public a statement to this effect for th t benefit of-would-be organisers?\nIn any case, should not thb\nBoard make available to members of the Union (by whom\nit is partially financed) en\nunambiguous statement of the\nprinciples which guide its disposal annually of some \u00a31,300?\nI. C.ART CLUB The Art Club has been flourishing for four years now. It\ngives I.C. students a chance\nto paint and draw from mod-els, with expert tuition and at\nlow cost. We meet ever\nWednesday between 2.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. in one of the\nstudios of the Royal College of\nArt in Exhibition Road. We\nuse the models hired by RCA who also supply the materials.\nThere is a charge of 4 shillings\na session, everything included,\nthe greater part of the cost\nbeing born by the College.\nConnie Fenn, former scholar\nof the RCA, is the tutor.\nOfficially the club packs up\n'. at the end of the Lent Term,\n[ however, last year during the\n; Summe r Term the members\n\u2022 did some landscape painting.\n'. As there was a sufficient num-', ber of Londoners we carried on\n| painting during the vac s. Apart from visits to exhibit-ions, the club held a fifty\npainting exhibition of its own\nin the Physics building at the\nend of the Summer Term.\nIf you want to make a serious attempt at this difficult\nbusiness of life painting or just\nwant to dabble in paint one\nodd afternoon, we should be\nglad to see you.\nFor enquires, contact Martin Clark, Level 9, Electrical\nEngineering High Block Building. Internal 'phone 3126.\nIf you divide the population into two groups \u2014\nthose who take THE TIMES and those who don't \u2014\nyou find this: those who don'tt a ke THE TIMES are in the great majority. Those who do are either at the\ntop in their careers, or are confidently headed there.\nTHE TIMES both by its seniority in experience and by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper, naturally commends itself to successful people. There is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top executive's private office\ninto which THE TIMES is not apt to be taken. This choice of a newspaper by people who get\non is indisputable.* In which of the two groups do you place yourself?

When most students are sensibly lying in bed,\nthe more active section of the i College can be seen on the river in support of their respective college. Training is progressing well\ndespite early morning fogs and Dr. Beeching and a fast, close\nrace can be expected.\nThough on paper, the RCS Morphy appear the more experienced crew, Guilds have a powerful eight Which will take a lot o,f beating. Few people in their right mind would comment\non the look of the Mines Boat. The Lowry crews look fast compared with previous years and here again a good race can be pre-dic ted. If however, you have no interest in the finer arts of row-ing, come along on the 7th to support your College in the biggest\nbattle since the '61 Gala. Dress (clothes) is optional, and tickets\nare on sale at any Underground Station. The latter are, however\nrarely distributed due to lack of co-operation between the L.T.E. and police departments.\nThe Boat Club has recruited a record number of fresher s and is commencing a monster programme of mass-instruction.\nHelped by this and tib\u00a94arge number of last year's crews who were\nallowed back by higher authorities, the Club expects to ma it a in the high standard of recent years.\nGLIDING CLUB Dawn at Lasham on July 1st saw the start of the first IC\nGliding Club expedition to\nCambridge. Three cars and\ntwo trailers coped with the party of seven and our two air-craft, an Eagle two seater and\na solo Skylark 2 (Phoenix).\nIn true gliding tradition, the\nMonday broke wet and windy,\nand was declared a non-con-lest day, while punting in\nthe afternoon soon degenerated\nin J.o bird-watching on the river\nbanks. The weather on Tuesday proved not much better,\nbut short distances were co-ve red, Phoenix winning the\nclay by a small margin.\nWednesday's sky followed the\nsame '.rend, but previous experience suggested that it was\nso arable under the eight-eigth s strato-cumulus (rather\ncloudy). The small gain of\n500 feet after release was\njudged sufficient to set\ncourse across the be s had owed. Cambridgeshire countryside. The Cambridge Skylark 2, however, had the\nmisfortune to end up against\nla large tree in a very small\nfield.\nWith the competition's forces\nreduced to an Olympian, the\nPhoenix crew sail led forth\nlightheartedly, only to be well\nout-flown in Thursday's murky\nsky. The flame of competition\nnow burned more strongly, but\nwas firmly ex st ingui shed on the\nFriday when the Olympian\nlined up accurately on a telegraph pole after a flight of\nsome 20 miles.

So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014\u2022 and all young people like you.

On Saturday, with A\\ trials running\nsimultaneously, the fresher s were seen challenging the old, indeed ve iry old, plodders for their first team places.\nAmong the new lads to\nIN THE early 1950's the RCS Union was looking for a suitable\nvehicle to act as '\n0 mascot, but it was not until 1955 that one\nturned up in the shape of a fire engine in Warrington. Further\ninvestigation revealed a1916 Dennis Fire Appliance with a9il r., four cylinder engine which devoured petrol at the rate of five\nmiles to the gallon. Negotiations with the owners, Messrs. Crossfield and Son., resulted in the presentation of the fire engine to\nthe Union,( in view of its 'edc u at ional interest'.\nAfter a rather hazardous and\nCar Club, such as the meeting\nat Silverstone.\nFinally, we would like to\nsay .that al j l are welcome to\nthe Club, anyone wanting further information should get in\ntouch with David Hughes via\nthe Union Rack.\neventful jou ney( the big ends\nwien t) the fire engine finally\narrived in London. As a result of this acquisition, the\nnucleus of the RCS Motor\nClub was formed from a few\nof the more motor minded\nmembers of the Union. The\nmain concern of the Motor\nClub since then has been the\ncare and main ten ace of the fire\nengine, which was christened\n'Jezebel', probably on account\nof her scarlet attire.\nTom 1955 to 1957, the engine was checked and rewired,\nthe body repainted and other\nbeauty treatment given. Since\nmost of the 'bugs' in the engine were ironed out then, the\nmaintenance nowadays consists\nof minor repairs (no previous\nmechanical experience required\n\u2014just keenness) and polishing\nthe brass work. Fifty five (55)\nsquare feet of brass, however,\nmean a lot of polishing, so if\nanyone is keen on ' Bull', then\nhere's your chance.\nIn the coming session, it is\nhoped to arrange works visits\nand film shows for the interest of the Bluebell stained\npolishers, as well as sporting\nJez at various ceremonial oc-cas ions. Early in November,\nthere is the veteran car run to\nBrighton, and Jez has made a point of being there as a spectator since 1957; some police\neven think that she is a competitor (actually some tw el vt. years too young). In May, Jez will again travel to Bright,\non, this time as a competitor\n\u2022in ti he Historic Commercial\nVehicle Club run, a new venture started in May 1962.

The\njourney out was broken in\nParis for one day and one\nnight, spending ti he night at\nthe Maison des Jeunes et de\nla Culture, the only advantage\nof this establishment being\nthat it was cheap. After a full day's sightseeing, the\njourney to Spain was com-ple ted, and by devious means\nof transport (e.g. buses and\nmilk lorry owned by a character rejoicing in the name of\n'Pedro') the final destination\nwas reached. This was a small\nvillage called Querforodat, situated at a height of 4,000 ft.\nThe following fortnight was\nspent 'forest bashing' along\nnon-existent paths (marked on\nthe map, but not on the\nground), attempting to walk\nalong Sierra del Codi, and visiting Andorra, which was full\nof tourists. The camp ended\nwith the traditional dinner,\nheld at the local \"vino bar\"\nwhere the wine flowed\nfreely, and then the party adjourned to Barcelona,\ncamping next to a slaughter\nhouse where pigs were killed\nat 5 a.m. The following day\nwas spent sightseeing, swimming in the Mediterranean,\nand in the evening we saw a bull-fight\u2014a rather gory but\nvery impe s sive spectacle, then\nafter a meal of fried squid we\nreturned to the slaughterhouse camp site and the following day returned to London.\nNo-one got arrested for\nknees in Spain, but one group\ndid get arrested for crossing the\nSpanish-Andorran frontier illicitly, but were rel leased after\nout-drinking the guards.\n\n"
