    "content": "Silk Sonic, the unlikely pairing of Bruno Mars and\nAnderson .Paak, collided with our eardrums in March\n2021, and blessed us with the instant hit: \u2018Leave the\nDoor Open\u2019. The saturated orange visuals, \u201870s flares,\nand playful energy were intoxicating. Silk Sonic\ntold us, yes, music can actually\nbe \u201csmooth like a newborn\u201d. We\nthen all collectively lost our minds\nwaiting for an album from this\nincredibly talented duo, who took a\nwhole eight months to deliver.\nTheworldwassohungryforsome\nvelvet funk that this one single got\nreplayed literally over 500 million\ntimes on Spotify and probably 500\nmillion more times on TikTok.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it is excellent,\nbut it begged the question: could the album ever live\nup to the immense amount of hype? I am here to tell\nyou that yes, it absolutely does.\nSome say a ten-track album is an instant classic;\nAn Evening with Silk Sonic is just one song shy, but\nit doesn\u2019t seem to hold them back. There\u2019s a timeless\nquality to this album with the obvious soul and funk\ninfluences from Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u2018Get Down\u2019 and the\nfamiliar warmth of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018What\u2019s Going On\u2019.\nD\u2019mile and Mars\u2019\nproduction is close\nto flawless. Bootsie\nCollins adds to the\ndreamlike vibe,\nplaying his part\nperfectly as the\nmystical narrator in\ngroovy interludes.\nAs a listener, you\nare very aware that\nyou are listening\nto musicians at the\ntop of their game.\nIt\u2019s clear this duo\nknew exactly what\nthey were doing\nand executed it to\nperfection. There\nis a high level of\ntechnical precision\nhere, but it does absolutely nothing to detract from\nthe fact that everyone is just having fun. Silk Sonic are\nlike Italian food. The sum is greater than its parts.\n\u2018Fly As Me\u2019 hits immediately with a tight baseline\ngroove, eccentric wind section, and so much damn\nenergy, sending a clear reminder Silk Sonic do not\naim to underwhelm. There\u2019s a lot of reverence for the\npioneers of the genres fused together here, making\nreferencestoPrinceandTeenaMarie.\n.Paakabsolutelyshineswithsomuch\ncharisma, uniqueness, nerve and\ntalent that I am mesmerised, while\nMars supplies some unsurprisingly\nexcellent vocals. This song is\ngenuinely addictive and we\u2019re only a\nthird of the way through the album.\nLooking at the rest of the album,\n\u2018After Last Night\u2019 is a personal\nfavourite and a complete change of\npace. Thundercat deliver incredible\nbaselines and Mars gives a gorgeous, surprise electric\nguitarsolo.Thisslowergrooveseemstohavesome90\u2019s\nR&B influences which blend ineffortlessly. \u2018Smoking\nOut the Window\u2019 is unfortunately a miss and \u2018Put\nOn a Smile\u2019 fails to grab my attention. However, I am\npulled back with the manic intro to \u2018777\u2019. This track\nlets us know exactly why this duo might be legendary.\n.Paak lets his vocals and drums play off each other\nexpertly and Mars shows off a magnetic charisma that\nI don\u2019t think anyone\nelse in the music\nindustry possesses.\nOverall, this album\ndoes not disappoint\nat all. It is no wonder\n.Paak says working\nwith Mars is like\na \u2018cheat code\u2019 to\nexcellent music. The\nchemistry here is\npalpable and I am so\nexcited to see what\nthey come up with\nnext. It\u2019s satisfying\nto see such a strong\nvision executed so\nwell. Although the\nmid-album\u2019s lull\nin energy is its one\npitfall, the music\u2019s\nrecovery launches us back into that \u201870s funk, soul,\nand rap dreamscape, immersing us in its undeniable\ngenius.\n21\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Rosie Millns\nTara Pal Chaudhuri\nMusic\nDon\u2019t miss the gig - IC\nBig Band VS RCM SU Big\nBand @ Metric, 2nd Dec\nAre you Team\nImperial or\nTeam RCM?\nCome to\nMetric on 2nd\nDecember to\nwatch IC Big Band clash with RCM SU\nBig Band in the first battle of the\nacademic year!\nBoth bands will be playing some\nimmense sets, so you cannot afford\nto miss out.\nView online here!\nSinister yet ethereal\nchildlike vocals\njuxtapose industrial,\ndissonant, grungy\nriffs on Irish band\nJust Mustard\u2019s latest\nsingle.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n22\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nOne of the first actual songs I learned to play on\nguitar was \u2018Grounds for Divorce\u2019 by Elbow. It\u2019s\neasy to listen along to Guy Garvey\u2019s catchy \u201cwoah-woah-woah\u201d-ing on that track and get the wrong idea\nof the secrets that are hidden in the album it comes\nfrom \u2013 The Seldom Seen Kid. From the fuzzy, drip-ping-with-sweetness crooning on \u2018Mirrorball\u2019, to the\nanthemic \u2018One Day Like This\u2019, the album is a loud\nmix of all sorts of emotions and highs-and-lows. It is a\ncelebration of life and love. The titular character of the\nalbum was Bryan Glancy, a friend of Garvey and his\nfather, who died suddenly in 2006. The closing track,\n\u2018Friend of Ours\u2019, is directly dedicated to him.\nWhilst The Seldom Seen Kid was written in Glancy\u2019s\nmemory, the track of the same name on Flying Dream\n1 has Garvey reminiscing about the man himself.\nHauntingly beautiful clarinets mingle with Garvey\u2019s\nvoiceashecreatesthescene,imagininghiswifemeeting\nGlancy, recalling his charm and his wit, painting a\nprofoundly bittersweet picture of his memories with\nhim. \u201cThen he\u2019d steal you for dancing / and you\u2019d lend\nhim your arms / and I\u2019d stooge for your laughing /\nand you\u2019d twirl in the chaos of charm.\u201d You can almost\nimagine the scene in some lively pub in Bury, some\nwatering hole the band and\nGlancy frequented, perhaps\nwhere \u2018Grounds for Divorce\u2019\nwas set. Except where in 2008\nthere was a sense of being\ntrapped, unable to escape, now\nthere\u2019s a fondness for faces and\nplaces gone by.\nFlying Dream 1 harkens\nback to those places of the\nband\u2019s youth, the faces which\nnow only exist in pictures on\nthe fridge and nestled deep in\ntheir memories. The title track\nhas Garvey floating through\nthe cold northern sky on the\nway back to his hometown.\n\u201cHolcombeandPendle,Nelson\nand Colne / Follow the landing\nlights guiding me home.\u201d He\ninvites us with him on a journey back to the past. On\n\u2018Six Words\u2019, the band once again try and capture the\npure emotion of falling head-over-heels in love with\nsomeone. It\u2019s not the same fuzziness as \u2018Mirrorball\u2019,\nor the same shout to the sky as \u2018One Day Like This\u2019,\nbut it packs the same punch. When the chorus kicks\nin, Garvey is joined by the backup singers, singing \u201cI\nknow, I know the view from on top of the world.\u201d It\u2019s\nhard for me not to get a lump in my throat. \u201cLook who\nloves me,\u201d Garvey smiles, and you can almost see the\nlove hearts popping around his face.\nThe band\u2019s members have lost friends and family\nover the years, but new life has come to them, too. In\n\u2018Come On, Blue\u2019, Garvey sings to his son: \u201cCome on\nblue, as if that moon\u2019s not there for you.\u201d His words\nare oozing with love, and the simple accompaniment\nin the background serves as a fitting backdrop for the\naffection that\u2019s flowing through\nGarvey\u2019s words. Jack Garvey\nis the subject of the closing\ntrack as well, in which he sings,\n\u201cWhat am I on the Earth for? /\nIf not to put you to bed?\u201d The\nsong is as triumphant and loud\nas the album gets. The simplistic\nnature of the line-up on this\nalbum doesn\u2019t interfere with just\nhow proud Garvey is of the love\nhe feels for his child. This time,\nthough, instead of the sweeping\nsing-along ending of \u2018One Day\nLike This,\u2019 we\u2019re treated to a\ncalm piano solo, settling our\nemotions in the same way as\nrocking a baby to sleep.\nElbow\u2019s newest album doesn\u2019t\nbreak any boundaries. It\u2019s not\nas charged and energetic as 2019\u2019s Giants of All Sizes,\nand it doesn\u2019t make as many bold statements as their\nother albums. Those looking for the sing-along charms\nof Elbow\u2019s previous hits won\u2019t find them here. Instead,\nyou\u2019ll find a record dripping with memory and hope,\ncomposed of the small love-letters of music the band\nhad sent each other over lockdown. Despite its small\nscale and simple ideas, it\u2019s quickly become one of my\nfavourite albums of the year, packing an emotional\npunchthatnobandotherthanElbowcanquiteachieve.\nMondays are for drinking with The Seldom Seen Kid.\nWritten by Ben Batemen Music Writer\nPeach Pit Announce New Album From 2 To 3\nWritten by Joe Riordan Music Writer\nPeach Pit\u2019s big announcement of an album and a\nworld tour with a new single to top it off can wait\na few lines for some more important news following\nup on my last article. I managed to get Hippo Campus tickets and, as I write this, I\u2019m realising it might\nclash with Peach Pit\u2019s freshly announced London date\nat O2 Forum Kentish Town so I\u2019ll be back to writing\nin a second after I check I won\u2019t have to go and see\nPeach Pit in a different city across the country.\nLuckily, the dates don\u2019t clash. Back to Peach Pit.\nFollowing the release of \u2018Up Granville\u2019, the debut\nsingle from their new album, Peach Pit have returned\nwith \u2018Look Out!\u2019. Usually, the band create spacey songs\nfull of reverb and jingly guitar riffs provided by lead\nguitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, one of my favourite\nguitarists whose parts I\u2019m always excited to learn. The\nnew track has all these aspects but feels much more\nstripped back and open, as if it was being performed\nfrom a moving car - as it actually is in the music video\nwhich plays like a love letter to long drives and the\nmindless thoughts that occur on them.\nThe lyrics, as always with Peach Pit, capture a\nparticular melancholy idea while being accompanied\nbycheerymusic\u2013\u201cLookoutforme,won\u2019tyouthough?\n/ I just might pass you by\u201d. Singer Neil Smith\u2019s ethereal\nvocals enhance the thoughtful lyricism perfectly,\nspotlighted by the stripped back nature of the track.\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be a new Peach Pit release\nBen Batemen reviews Elbow\u2019s most recent album, Flying Dream 1, released on November 19th.\n\u201c\nFLYING DREAM 1\nHARKENS BACK TO\nTHOSE PLACES OF\nTHE BAND\u2019S YOUTH,\nTHE FACES WHICH\nNOW ONLY EXIST IN\nPICTURES ON THE\nDRIDGE A D NESTLED\nDEEP IN THEIR\nMEMORIES\n\n"

Charmer went to\nover 30 countries during the run-up to\nCOP26, including Indonesia, Kenya,\nandBrazil,accordingtotheGuardian.\nFor reference, it took Greta Thunberg\n15 days to sail from Plymouth, UK\nto New York in 2019 for a climate\nconference. Whilst this offsets an\nimmense amount of carbon from the\naverage person\u2019s annual footprint,\nkind on the calendar it is not.\nCOP26 was widely received as\nbitter-sweet. There was no tectonic\nshift that left the world net zero\nby 2025, but equally there was\nsignificant progress made on many\nfronts. Deforestation to end by 2030,\nwith Brazil (one of Charmer\u2019s haunts,\nas mentioned) as a signatory. 30%\nmethane reduction pledge signed\nby 104 countries and a \u201cdeath knell\u201d\nfor coal power, the world\u2019s dirtiest\npolluter. Estimates of the reduction\nin global heating, whilst not where\nthey need to be, are still colossal.\nNow, call me crazy, but I reckon\n30 or so flights around the world\nare worth it. Considering around\n100,000 flights leave the runway every\nday (pandemic not included), and\nthis tiny number has contributed to\nan estimated 0.9 degree decrease in\nglobal heating by 2100, I think it\u2019s\nprobably alright that they went ahead.\nCuts on domestic flight duty,\nwhich are 100% unnecessary as\nanyone can cross the UK by train\nwithin a day, get quietly swept under\nthe budget rug whilst Sharma,\nwho was brought almost to tears at\nthe crux of the COP summit, gets\nlambasted by comment sections and\neven national newspaper columns.\nSome commentators see Sharma\nflying around the world to different\ncountries in the spirit of COP\nas hypocritical because\naviation is such a large\ncontributor to global\nemissions. Whilst this is\ntrue, surely the reason for\nthe flights should be taken\ninto account? He\u2019s making\nsome of the biggest\nchanges anyone has ever\nmade to climate change with\neach flight. Asking you to get the train\ntoEdinburghratherthanflytoLisbon\nfor your weekend away is not quite the\nsame as flying to Brazil, resulting in\nthe home of the Amazon pledging to\nend deforestation by 2030. The word\nhypocrisy just does not apply here.\nSharma is a particular example\nof media persecution, however an\nexample far closer to our community\u2019s\nheartisepidemiologistNeilFerguson,\nwho was torn apart by the media near\nthe beginning of lockdown #1 for\nseeing his girlfriend in his home. He\nended up handing his resignation\nto SAGE as a result. Ferguson had\ncontracted COVID just weeks before\nand there was essentially zero chance\nthat he could spread the virus further.\nAside from misleading allegations\nof adultery, this was also seen as a\nflagrant display of hypocrisy of the\nelites by much of the media. The\nBBC even reported in May that \u201cit\nis currently unclear whether people\nwho have recovered from the virus\nwill be immune or able to catch it\nagain\u201d, as if we\u2019ve ever come across a\nrespiratory virus that doesn\u2019t convey\nimmunityoncethehosthasrecovered.\nObviously he should not have done it\nfrom a PR point of view, but this was\none of the most epidemically well-versed men in the country seeing a\nsingle individual when he was all but\ncertain that he could not transmit\nthe virus.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n24\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEvery week Felix speaks to an Imperial student\nto find out what the Imperial community has been\nlistening to. This week we spoke to Imperial\u2019s most\npopular disco pop band, Goldstag, following their\nlively sets at the Welcome Ball and Arts Night, and (at\nthe time of writing) ahead of their headline Metric gig\nthis Thursday (25th November).\nHow did you guys meet?\nRielley: Live music society\u2019s random band night. They\nput myself (vocals, keys), Charlie (guitar) and Oli\n(drums) together with another bassist, and that night I\nalso met Tom (bass) for the first time. The guy playing\nwith us was doing a PhD and didn\u2019t have time to join\na band-Tom: -so you went with second choice.\nCharlie: The three of us, we did Feelin\u2019 Good. We\npicked it because it was an easy song, but we didn\u2019t get\nto practise at all. We were sat on the stairs beforehand.\nOli was drumming on his knees, but it turned out\nwell. If you can do Random Band Night well, you can\nmanage.\nHow long have you been recording original stuff for?\nC: We\u2019ve been through a couple of stages as a band, and\nwe\u2019ve arrived at something we quite like now. We\u2019ve got\na back catalogue of things. At the moment we have two\nwe are performing live, another one we\u2019ll play at Metric\non Thursday, and one on Spotify.\nR: Before these songs we had another 7 we had written\nbefore. We had an EP of 7 songs. The plan was to go\ninto the studio and record them, and then COVID\nhit. By the time a year came around, we wanted to do\nsomething different. We might release them down the\nline.\nIs the style of these songs similar to the stuff you\ncover, or a different direction?\nC: The two original songs slot in quite nicely to our set.\nOne was more on the dance end - I mean, everything\nwe do we want people to dance to, but one was a bit\nmore on the rock-y end.\nSo kind of like Abba meets Royal Blood?\nR: It\u2019s kind of Queen meets Dua Lipa. I like a lot of\nmusic from the 70s and 80s, with a retro anthemic spin\non things.\nC: The 80\u2019s influence is really there. We are also\ninfluenced by artists who are bringing back the 80s, like\nDua Lipa and The 1975.\nWhat is the last song you listened to?\nR: Ain\u2019t Nobody by Chaka Khan. It\u2019s a daily ritual. I\nlisten to that song at least once a day. I love the intro\nespecially. It\u2019s an instant pick me up that puts me in\na good mood. It\u2019s good fun. I love Chaka Khan as an\nartist.\nDo you have any standout memories you associate\nwith that song?\nR: It sounds a bit clich\u00e9, but it was introduced to me\nby my mum. She\u2019s a big fan of American 80\u2019s singers,\nlike Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Whitey Housten, and\nshe used to play the song a lot when I was a kid. I\u2019m just\nreally lazy so I still listen to the same music now that I\ndid when I was really young.\nWhat is your favourite part of that song?\nR: I really love the intro. I\u2019m a huge fan of songs with\ngood intros. It\u2019s one of those songs I always keep in\nmind when I\u2019m writing myself. The way it builds each\ninstrument layer by layer, it\u2019s immediately recognisable\nfrom the first bass part. The bridge is also awesome, I\nlove it.\nYou\u2019re stranded on a desert island and can only listen\nto 3 albums for the rest of your life \u2013 go:\nTom: This was a difficult one.\nC: On the theme of 80\u2019s inspired records, we picked\nFuture Nostalgia by Dua Lipa. It has quite a range of\nstuff on it. The title track is unlike anything you\u2019ll hear\nin the charts.\nR: Future Nostalgia as an album is full of good intros.\nC: \u2018Break My Heart\u2019 is a track we like to cover, it\u2019s quite\nfunky.\nR: The album really kept the 80s in the charts. Another\nalbum for us would be Hot Space by Queen, who are\noneofmyfavouritebands.It\u2019saprettyunknownQueen\nalbum. It wasn\u2019t a big commercial success, in fact it\nactually flopped quite badly. Critics at the time were\nsaying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s the end of Queen.\u201d This was 1982. The\nalbum was basically the very first time that a rock band\nincorporated disco. There was a lot of backlash against\nit.

But this is going to be a very\nhypocritical motivational piece. \u2018Why\u2019\nyou ask? Well, I am one of those individuals who spends more time thinking\nabout what I need to do, than I actually\nspend doing what I need to do. Furthermore, I am also one of those people who\ncannot sit still or relax when I know\nthat I have tasks to complete. I often do\nthis because I tell myself I am \u2018too busy\u2019,\nand so my long to-do-list takes precedence over all other areas of my life.\nThereisnodoubtinmymindthatthis\nbehaviourispartlyduetotheheavywork-load that gets thrown at me each term.\nHowever, the workload is something\nthatIcannotchange.Infact,Iwillalways\nhave more to do, and sometimes when I\nthink about this, I feel trapped. Because\nit is hard to look at the future without\nfeeling quite bleak when you realise that\nyou will always be chasing deadlines.\nDespite the obvious fact that I will\nnever consistently be on top of things,\nI often refuse to believe that I will never complete my to-do-list. In defiance,\nI double down my efforts and devote\neven more time to my tasks. Then: I\nstart bailing on social events, I miss lec-tures, I skip tutorials, I evade sleep, and\nI try to minimise any time spent doing\nthe most mundane of tasks. Gradually my days become swallowed up with\nwork, but my productivity never max-imises for some reason. And each day\nbecomes more miserable than the last.\nI tried to find freedom by releasing myself from the shackles of my\nlist, but this approach just demanded more and more of my time until I\nfound myself overwhelmed \u2013 and often without much work to show for it.\nOn the contrary, where I really found\nmy freedom was in embracing each\nmoment that I spent not working.\nI\u2019d go even further and say that I renewed my interest in my course when I\nspent less time working on my subjects.\nI am still as busy as I was before, and I\nstill feel rushed most days \u2013 but by forcing myself to allocate more time to ex-tra-curricular tasks, I\nfound myself more\nfocused on my academic tasks. Allocating time off is the\neasy part though,\nthe real freedom\ncomes when you\nimmerse yourself\nin those moments.\nIn other words, it\nis just as important\nto devote your attention as it is to\ndevote your time.\nI cannot take\ncredit for this re-alization, I have\nto thank Tony\nCrabble, author\nof \u2018Busy: How to Thrive in a World\nof Too Much\u2019. Funnily enough, I have\nbeen \u2018too busy\u2019 to actually complete the\nbook, but Crabble prepared for readers\nlike me. In the preface of the book, he\ngives a brief run through of the book\u2019s\ncontent and one sentence on how to\n\u2018gain mastery\u2019 in life stood out to me.\nCrabble says we should be \u201cshifting our\nfocus from managing time to managing\nattention\u201d. He goes further in his book\nto compare the state of \u2018busyness\u2019 to a\nstate in which we are \u2018attention deficit\u2019.\nSo, I believe that it is imperative to\nstop your academic work from consuming more and\nmore of your time,\nespecially if you\nwant to improve\nyour academic per-formance. There is\nnothing wrong in\ntaking a break and\nforgetting about\nthat piece of coursework that is due to-morrow. In fact, it\nwill not jeopardise\nyour academic career if watch a long\nfilm in bed with\nthe lights out and\nforget about Imperial for three hours.\nSome may call\nthat escapism, but I am speaking from\nexperience. I completed my 1st year happy with the amount of work I put into\nmy degree, but I also felt a pang of emptiness in hindsight. Before Imperial, two\nof the things I loved doing more than\nstudying were reading, and art. Yet in\nthe whole of my 1st year here, I did not\nread a single book and I did not touch\nany of my art supplies. On top of that, I\nwas a student in the middle of London,\nsurrounded by so much culture and op-portunitiesandstillIspentasmuchtime\nas I could slouching over my desk in my\nsmallWoodwardroom.Iwouldbewalk-ing past the V&A everyday and yet all I\ncould think about was how late I was.\nEventually I recognised that the workload will always be high, the deadlines\nwill come and go, but you cannot reverse\ntime to take back all those hours you\ndidn\u2019t actually need to spend on a task.\nI wish I had spent more time exploring my extra-curricular interests, but\nI cannot focus on my regrets. Instead,\nI have been slowly branching out by\npushing myself to do things I never\nthought I\u2019d have time for (like becoming a Section Editor for Felix) and thus\ndeveloping a deeper sense of fulfilment\nin all aspects of my life. For example, I\nrecently attended an Open Theme Art\nClass held at the Blyth Studio even\nthough I had a lot of tasks I still hadn\u2019t\ncompleted. For almost two silent hours,\nI immersed myself in a sketch \u2013 without\nreaching for my headphones to listen to\nmusic or for my phone for distractions.\nHave you given yourself time to have a\nmoment like this lately? If you\u2019re not\nsure about what hobbies you can take\non, I\u2019d suggest that a good starting point\nis to immerse yourself in the mundane\nparts of your day, like cooking food.\nUltimately, I want to stress that you\nshould allow yourself to slow down and\nembrace the moments in-between tasks.\nEmbrace each moment you spend not working.\nYou Are Never Too Busy.\nKhamaGunde\nCommentEditor\nPhoto credits: Lilartsy on Pexels\nWhen was the last time you read a book that you enjoyed?\nALLOCATING\nTIME OFF IS\nTHE EASY PART\nTHOUGH, THE\nREAL FREEDOM\nCOMES WHEN\nYOU IMMERSE\nYOURSELF IN\nTHOSE MOMENTS\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Khama Gunde\nCreative time in Blyth Arts Studio\n\n"

    "content": "Iwas sitting in the passenger seat of my\ndad\u2019s Escalade as we made our way to\nour hometown in Oman in the summer\nof 2020. My dad, being a petroleum engineer, was\neager to discuss the WSJ report, that was written a few\ndays earlier, which had predicted a boom in oil prices.\nPrices were potentially reaching $150 per barrel (pb)\n- following the unprecedented crash to negative value\nwhich had happened just a few months earlier. By this\npoint, oil had recovered to over $40 pb but the drastic\neffect of the pandemic on our economy was felt across\nthe country.\nFast forward to now, we find the boom has indeed\noccurred. Oil is at its greatest prices since 2014 and\ndespite slowly declining $8 in these past 4 weeks, a\nstrong number of people believe the boom is yet to\npeak.\nFollowing a decade of poor returns, most private and\npublicly owned companies are favouring paying back-debts and rewarding shareholders, while aggregate\nspending on new wells remains flat. While it seemed\nall non-state-owned oil companies have been chastened\nby Wall Street and banks to avoid reinvesting into\nproduction, the strategy has worked in favour of\ncompanies; 5 of the 10 best performing S&P 500 stocks\nYear-To-Date (YTD) are shale oil companies.\nThe slow increase in production (coupled with\nthe rapid return of the demand for oil as lockdown\nrestrictions are being removed across the globe) is what\nhas led to the great increase in prices we\u2019ve witnesses\nso far. In the past 3 weeks, the price of Brent Crude\nhas been decreasing, falling from a peak of $87 to just\nover $82 today, largely following speculation the Biden\nadministration will be releasing oil from the United\nStates Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\nThis comes as inflation is soaring in the US at 6.2%\nin October YTD with rising energy costs to blame\nand fuel prices rising over 12% monthly. This was\nfelt here in England as well with the governor of the\nBank of England admitting he feels uneasy about the\ninflation situation. Yesterday, diesel and petrol prices\nhit an all-time high and the AA\u2019s fuel price spokesman\ncommented: \u201cIt will likely usher in even higher costs for\ngoodsandservices.\u201dTherisingpriceoffuelhasadomino\neffect, as bigger businesses use a system of surcharges\nfor deliveries, so the greater expense is charged to the\ncustomer who passes it on to the consumer.\nAs of today (Tuesday 23rd November), it is all but\nconfirmed that the Biden administration will release\ntheir reserve oil to sell to major Asian energy consumers\nafter already asking China, India, South Korea, and\nJapan to do the same. According to Reuters, Japan and\nIndia are working to do just that. Biden has said in a\nbroadcast: \u2018Before long, you should see the price of gas\ndrop when you fill your tank.\u2019\nBrent is now at $79.30, and a coordinated release\nof reserve crude oil, predicted by Citigroup analysts\nto be on the magnitude of \u2018100-120 million barrels\nor higher\u2019, could mark a devastating end to the price\nrally we have seen. The Organisation for Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC) have resisted Biden\u2019s\nurges for more rapid increases in production due to\nthe rebound in demand potentially being fragile. This\nis especially true now, with new lockdown restrictions\nintroduced in Europe. All these symptoms scream an\nimminent bear market.\nDespite all this, there remain many who think that\nthe prices will remain at and above current levels this\nquarter and in the next year. A source told Al-Jazeera\nthat South Korea and India aren\u2019t likely to contribute\nmuch, and the commitment of other countries involved\nis still not guaranteed. Major banks including Barclays\nand Goldman Sachs are unshaken by the reports, with\nBarclays raising its 2022 forecast of Brent to $80pb\nstating the Strategic Petroleum Reserves are not a\nsustainable supply source and the price effect because of\nit would be temporary. Goldman were bold enough to\nkeep their fourth quarter estimates of Brent for this year\nat $85, rightly stating that the recent $8 decline was not\nbased off fundamentals, rather over \u2018excessive concern\u2019\nabout speculation.\n\u201cOur pricing model shows that the $8 per barrel\n($8/bl) price decline since late October is equivalent to\nthe market pricing in a 4 million barrel per day (b/d)\ncombined hit to demand or increase in supply over the\nnext three months,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019s analysts wrote in\nthe note cited by Argus.\nThe bank noted that this is equivalent to a \u2018100\nmillion barrel government stock release as well as a\n1.75 million b/d hit to demand due to current Covid\nresurgence.\u2019 This shows us how unjustified the recent\ndecline has been and points towards the greater values\npredicted by Goldman. This also marks the $120 June\nprice predicted by the Bank of America last month to\nbe very plausible despite the White House\u2019s efforts.\nIt strengthens the argument that the markets already\ncorrected itself for the release of crude oil from reserves,\nso if the release goes through, the price of oil should not\ndecrease further (based off its fundamental value). We\nmust also not forget that OPEC+ are meeting next\nweek to discuss production and could easily fight the\nBiden administration by decreasing production.\nThis optimism for prices was also shared by the\nInternational Energy Agency who, after Tuesday last\nweek, upped their average 2022 Brent crude prediction\nto $79.40 per barrel. Their reason concerned the\nincrease in demand due to the return of previous air-travel levels and gasoline consumption as lockdowns\nbecome (hopefully) a thing of the past.\nOverall, there is an air of uncertainty surrounding\nthe price predictions for the future of oil, but most\nevidence points towards an upcoming year of 80 dollar\nBrent crude, even if the following month brings a\ndecline in prices.\nAre the increasing prices of oil slipping away?\nThings are getting oily...\nIt\u2019s actually pretty trivial \u2013if more people are wanting to buy oil (say, to fill up their cars) but the amount of oil available is largely remaining constant, prices will\nhave to go up to either cover the costs of producing more of the product, or even just to pocket more money and make larger profits... ka-ching!\nSUPPLY...

These include\nthe following: Christmas tree assembly,\nChristmas playlist compilation, and\nmulled wine manufacturing.\nTesco would have you believe that\nChristmas starts in October; talk about\ngiving an inch and taking a mile. Obviously, there are serious economic incentives for the UK high street to start advertising Christmas earlier than would\nbe expected, providing one benchmark\ntowhenChristmasstarts,nomatterhow\nmuch the thought of eating a mince pie\nin October may make your skin crawl!\nInKanyeWest\u2019sdebutChristmassong\ntitled \u201cChristmas in Harlem\u201d, Kanye famously describes celebrating Christmas\n\u201cRight after autumn falls\u201d. Consulting\nthe world wide web, the Autumn, or as\nMr West describes \u201cFall\u201d, ends on the\n21st of December. This somewhat surprised me as I thought Kanye was a big\nChristmas fan, although the proximity\nto Thanksgiving in the US suggests his\npossible need for rest in between the seasonal periods. Mr West\u2019s perspective on\nthis matter helps provide international\ncontext; where it must be stated that this\nis a global issue and underlines the nar-rowmindedness of some attitudes.\nThe common perspective is that\nChristmas and its associated festivities\ncommence on the 1st of December, no\nifs or buts. Seeing as this is the month\nin which Christmas Day occurs it makes\nsense to initiate the holiday season on\nthe 1st given it is the beginning of December.Thatisnottosaythatthislineof\nthinking is without its flaws. First, there\nare still 24 days remaining until the date\nitself, with many schools and employers\ncontinuing to work past this date until a few days prior. Furthermore, does\nthat mean you should go out and buy a\nChristmas tree on the 1st? In which case\nthis presents the possible risk of pine\nneedles clogging up the carpet. The ab-scission of needles in Balsam Fir (Abies\nbalsamea) trees was analysed in a study\ncarried out by the Christmas Tree Research Centre at Dalhousie University,\nCanada. The paper identified an estimated 100% abscission rate after roughly 2 weeks assuming a 1-week abscission\ninitiation period. This would suggest\nthat the optimal date for Christmas tree\npurchasing should lie around the 10th\nof December, or the 21st if your name\nrhymes with Can Ye Rest. Although this\nanalysis provides detail on Balsam Fir\ntrees which are native to North America\nand similar to the native Norway Spruce\n(Picea abies) which is typically sold in\nthe UK, it provides a comparative representation as to the potentially devastating consequences which could occur\nshould needle abscission commence earlier than expected.\nContrary to the early Christmas the-ories, there are those who believe in the\ntwelve days of Christmas, which start on\nChristmas Day itself and run through\nthe new year until the 5th of January. A\nday prior to \u201cEpiphany\u201d, more commonly known as Three Kings Day, which\ncommemoratesthevisitofthethreewise\nmen to Jesus Christ days after his birth.\nWhatever side of the proverbial fence\nyou may stand on, Christmas means\ndifferent things to different people and\nshould be treated as such. Celebrate\nwhen you want with those you want. In\nthe immortal words of Ferris Bueller,\n\u201cLife moves pretty fast.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\n37.7 million people globally were\nliving with HIV in 2020. Of those,\nmore than two thirds of the world\u2019s\nHIV-positive population is located in\nsub-Saharan Africa. HIV still remains\none of the most serious global health\nthreats of our time, but this appears to\nbe stalling. While the consequences of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on the HIV\nresponse are not yet known, there is renewed concern that the annual number\nof new HIV infections among adults\nhas remained static in recent years and\nare unlikely to reach the World Health\nOrganisation\u2019s targets for 2030.\nExcept for the rare occasions when a\nnew therapy is announced, we don\u2019t see\nmuch about HIV/AIDS in the news.\nIt is understood and generally accepted\nthat with the advances in antiretroviral\ndrug (ARV) adherence, a person infected with HIV can live a long and healthy\nlife. As a result, HIV and AIDS is no\nlonger seen as the unstoppable monster\nit once was, and for all intents and pur-poses, engagement in meaningful conversations around its eradication and\nmitigation does not appear to be a prior-ity. However, this perspective is one taken from a position of privilege; it is only\nin developed nations that such medical\nadvances have translated to actual, sustained improvements to quality of life.\nHIV/AIDS continues to ravage developing nations, particularly in sub-Sa-haran Africa. It is affecting human development of African countries through\nits devastating impact on quality of life,\nlife expectancy and access to healthcare\nassistance. It has destroyed the social\nfabric of communities; many adults, often parents, have died from the disease,\nwhich has in resulted in labour shortages and child-headed families, adversely\naffecting the economies of such nations\nand contributing to widespread poverty.\nLife expectancy has been dramatically reduced by the virus, with some areas\nhaving expectancies as low as 50 years.\nWith recent data suggesting that 2030\nUnited Nations targets are not on track\nto be met, what exactly is going wrong\nand what should we do about it?\nWHAT\u2019S GOING WRONG?\nEast and Southern Africa are the regions in the world most affected by HIV\nand are home to the largest number of\npeople living with it. Improved availability of HIV testing services now means\nfewer than two out of every ten people\nliving with HIV are unaware of their sta-tus. However, the number of people living with HIV in East and Southern Africa continues to increase. Although laws\nand cultural traditions vary between\nEast and Southern African countries,\nthere are a number of ingrained cultur-al, structural, and legal barriers to HIV\nprevention.\nStrategies to prevent the spread of the\nvirus across other continents such as Europe do not work as effectively in Africa.\nAmong the challenges are strong religious beliefs with regard the use of contraception and polyamory. This is only\none of many factors that allow the virus\nto run rampant across the continent.\nOther influencing factors include medication compliance, availability of ARVs.\nthe large size of rural communities, and\nthe stigma of the disease.\nHumanitarian aid has played a significant role in mitigating the impacts of\nHIV in sub-Saharan Africa, but it is still\nnot enough.\nThe humanitarian aid is centred\naround the UN\u2019s 2030 goal to have 90%\nof the HIV-positive population diag-nosed, 90% of the HIV-positive population on some form of treatment, and\n90% of the HIV-positive population\nundergoing viral suppression therapy,\ncoined the \u201c90-90-90 target\u201d. Organizations such as the Desmond Tutu Foundation and UNICEF, as well as large\nfirst-world government organizations\nsuch as the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) spearheaded the effort.\nThe pathway taken aims to educate\nthe population on HIV/AIDS and how\nto prevent it, while also providing the\nnecessary resources for prevention such\nas contraception and medication. A variety of different initiatives have been\nimplemented; for example, the \u201cACT\nagainst AIDS\u201d campaign (now known\nas \u201clet\u2019s stop HIV together\u201d) sponsored\nby the CDC. Their efforts were success-ful, and improvements in the situation\nwere seen in the long term. A study comparing key statistics between 2005 and\n2012 (which were the years in which\nthe majority of campaigns began) saw\nthat seven times more people were on\nantiretrovirals in 2012 than 2005. Furthermore, over that period, the number\nof annual deaths decreased by 33% and\nthe number of annual new infections\nwas down 25% across Africa.\nIn light of this progress, many organi-sations, particularly ones associated with\nforeign governments, began to pull out\nof Africa, believing that the continent\ncould handle the disease on its own from\nhere. Two of the largest benefactors who\nstopped their funding were the United\nKingdom and the United States. The\ngreatestimpactwasonNGOs(non-gov-ernmental organisations), many of\nwhom had to either stop their work al-together, or drastically cut back on their\nservices in local communities.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE\nIMPACT OF COVID-19,\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND\nOTHER ISSUES?\nLet\u2019s start with COVID-19, the\nsimpler one to address.

    "content": "Reducing transport emissions - are\nelectric vehicles really the solution?\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n14 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\nAnew announcement by Prime\nMinister Boris Johnson on November 22nd stated that all new homes\nbuilt from next year onwards would be\nrequired to have electric vehicle charging capacity. The UK\u2019s transportation\nsector accounts for approximately 27%\nof emissions, and this law, which will\nsee an estimated 145,000 new charging\npoints, is anticipated to drive the transition towards more sustainable modes of\ntransport (pun intended).\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market\nhas boomed in the last few years, with\nsales in the UK increasing from 2.5%\nof all cars sold in 2018 to 10% by 2020.\nBut one of the roadblocks to further\nexpansion has been the lack of charging\ninfrastructure \u2014 an issue further\ncompounded by the high cost of using\npublicones.Homechargingstationsthat\nare cheaper should help overcome this.\nBut are EVs and their charging\nstations really the solution to reduce\ntransportation emissions for good?\nAlthough the new law does sound like\nwe\u2019reheadingintherightdirection,itstill\nhascomplicationsthatmustbeovercome.\nFirstly, if we want the whole of the\nUK to gradually increase EV adoption,\nwe must address the existing disparity\nin the availability of charging stations\nbetween the North and South of the\nUK. Much of the rural regions are\nlagging far behind in the transition.\nEven if home charging stations are put\nin place, it becomes incredibly difficult\nfor individuals to make the switch if\npublic ones aren\u2019t readily available.\nThis also means that those in urban\nareas who purchase an EV might\nstruggle when it comes to driving into\nthe countryside. The unreliability of EV\nlong-distance travel is also exacerbated\nby the impacts of extreme cold and hot\nweather on battery capacity. Similar\nto how your iPhone battery drains\nfaster under these conditions, the stress\nimparted by high or low temperatures\nwill shorten the battery life, requiring\nmore frequent charging stops\u2014which\nare not as common outside of London.\nIf we want to incentivise widespread\nadoption of EVs, the bare minimum is to\nensure that they can be used as reliably\nas our current cars, including ways to\nimprove the distribution of public\ncharging stations across the UK. On the\nmanufacturer\u2019s side, the development\nof more robust batteries will be crucial.\nAnother issue that arises when\nquestioning whether home EV charging\nstations will actually incentivise EV\npurchases is the extremely high upfront\ncosts. This financial barrier imposes\na barrier for low-middle income\nfamilies to switch over. The average\nprice of an EV in the UK is currently\nhovering around \u00a344,000, ranging\nfrom \u00a317,350 up to \u00a3138,826\u2014not\nexactly an easy purchase decision.\nOne solution might look like\nsomething like the federal EV incentives\nimplemented in California as part\nof its Clean Fuel Rewards program.\nEligible vehicles for this program, such\nas Tesla and GM vehicles, are sold with\nup to $1,500 taken off the upfront sale\nprice. That might not seem like a lot,\nbut it\u2019s just one example of many other\nincentives in the US, such as the federal\ntaxcreditof$7,500andthecleanvehicle\nrebate project, all of which can help cut\ndown purchase costs. Unfortunately,\nprice reduction still requires much\nmore government support in the UK.\nThere\u2019s also the question of jobs\u2014\nEVs tend to have fewer moving parts\nthan the standard cars we see today that\nuse internal combustion engines. This\nmeans that if or when our economy\ntransitions towards EVs, there may be\nless need for workers to manufacture,\nrepair, and maintain our cars. Therefore,\nit will be crucial for the government\nto provide guidance and funding\nthat facilitates employees currently\nin the automotive industry to adopt\nskills needed in the green economy.\nThe geographic divide, economic\nbarrier and potential associated job loss\nof EV adoption point to the reality that\nthis new technology transition is still\nverymuchfocusedonurban,middleand\nupper-class individuals. Whilst the new\nlaw is significantly better than nothing,\nand technological improvements in\ncoming years should improve batteries\nand reduce costs, it\u2019s worth considering\nwhether fitting houses with charging\nstations is truly the most effective\napproach to push this transition.\nThis raises a fundamental question:\nAre ourattemptstoknuckledownonEVs\nfor reducing emissions in the transport\nsector a wise decision in the first place?\nDr Audrey de Nazelle, a Senior\nLecturerattheCentreforEnvironmental\nPolicy, has been researching the topic\nover the last several years. She looks at\nthe intersection between transportation,\nenvironmental sciences, health\nbehaviour, and urban planning. In one\nofherstudies,DrdeNazelleinvestigated\nthe overall cost-benefit of single-focused\napproaches vs holistic approaches\nfor reducing air pollution. The prior\nincludes solutions like improving vehicle\ntechnologies solely aimed to reduce\nemissions, whilst the latter encompasses\nbroader solutions like encouraging\nmodal shifts. The results showed that\nholistic approaches have a significantly\nhigher overall cost-benefit in the\nform of increased physical activities\nand improved health of individuals.\nAll of this is to say that because we\u2019re\ntoo fixated on the new technologies\nsurrounding EVs, we\u2019re disregarding\nthe most basic way to reduce emissions:\nreducing the use of cars in the first place.\nThis is achievable through measures\nsuch as strategic urban planning to\nencourage alternative transportation\nmodes like biking and walking. The\njourney of reducing transport emissions\ncan therefore massively benefit from\nexpanding its horizons to encompass\na broader range of policy solutions. It\nmight not be as fancy as having a nation\nfull of Teslas and charging stations in\nevery home, but it\u2019s accessible to all\nand has the potential to improve our\nhealth alongside that of the planet.\nIn the last year, companies including Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford and\nHyundai have successfully man-ufactured, or are in the process of\nmanufacturing, solid-state batter-ies. These overcome performance\nissues resulting from temperature\nimpacting the electrolyte surrounding current EV batteries and\nthe dangers of the battery catching\non fire. However, given the difficulty and high costs to produce\nthem, scaling up to mass-produc-tion levels has been a challenge.\nMonami Miyamoto Sustainability Editor\nAre EVs really the solution here?\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia Commons/Michael Movchin & Felix Muller\n\n"

    "content": "As Imperial College students, certain\nimages may now be more evocative\nthan they were before coming here: late night (early\nmorning) Uber Eats, Spotify-powered all-nighters,\nand summer Airbnb plans with friends. Beyond their\nimmense popularity with students, all three of these\ncompanies have one key operating tactic that makes\nthem almost unimaginably simple to scale \u2013 they own\nnone of their goods.\nThis is by no means a recent phenomenon;\nFacebook (now called \u2018Meta\u2019) trades in data we want\nnobody to see, sharing slices of the data pie with\nAmazon, Google, and Microsoft. However, Alibaba is\nunique in its aggressively consumer-facing stance; since\n2005, the business has grown to contain every manner\nof ancillary business required to analyse, target, process\nand provide for the needs of the common consumer.\nAnt Financial, their financial services platform,\ninitially (under the guise of Alipay) allowed buyers to\nfinance purchases with an escrow service on Alibaba,\nbut was soon rebranded as it grew to control almost\nhalf of China\u2019s online payment market within ten\nyears. Although Ant Financial was initially founded\nto make shopping on Alibaba easier, it is now the\nhighest valued fintech company in the world and it is\nlargely responsible for the near-extinction of cash in\nmetropolitan China.\nAt this point you may find yourself thinking that\nthis was a one-off, and perhaps even wondering why it\nmatters at all. On the contrary, the Alibaba Approach\nis more successful than the pale imitation attempted\nby Google (the eponym) in the western world.\nAlibaba successfully pulled off the same party trick in\nentertainment before moving to internet browsing,\napp stores, game distribution, email, medical services,\npharmaceutical products, and high-level sports.\nBeyond the obvious implications of a conglomerate\nusing your data to tailor online advertising towards\nyou, think about the power of a company that gathers\ndata every time you buy anything using Alipay\n(WeChat users have to contend with a separate\nconglomerate) and then subtly influences your views\nby shaping the culture, entertainment, and discourse of\nanyone with an internet connection.\n\u201cSurely someone must have said something,\u201d\nyou lament, only to learn that Alibaba also owns\nHong Kong\u2019s newspaper of record, the South China\nMorning Post, which is notable enough to appear on\nnews feeds in the UK. Alibaba has mastered the art of\nbeing indispensable.\nThis brings me to the focal point of this piece: the\nmost powerful companies will soon be those that pride\nthemselves on their successful integration into your\nlife, have nothing to sell and therefore almost nothing\nto lose. It can be argued that this is not just acceptable\nbut socially beneficial if the companies in question\ndo not have nefarious means. For example, few would\nsuspect Spotify of supporting the maltreatment of the\nUyghur community in the same way as Alibaba. In\nfact, I personally believe that the clear marketing tinge\nof Spotify\u2019s key community offerings (Friend Feeds,\nWrapped, and the new Blend feature) does little to\nchange the fact that they are genuinely effective tools\nand improve the user experience.\nRegardless of your personal views on this business\nmodel, it appears to be the future. Within the\nautomotive market, notable subscription schemes\nare currently offered by Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo,\nAudi, and Porsche. These companies are entirely\nresponsible for designing and producing the vehicles\nthey provide to customers, but the product here is\nfinancing, not the vehicle itself. Upon taking a closer\nlook, the hallmarks of the Alibaba Approach come to\nlight; these car companies are offering a related but\nseparate service to their\nforte, and are using a subscription model that keeps\nthem on customers minds throughout the year. All\nof these schemes are marketed with some focus upon\nthe \u201clifestyle\u201d embodied by the vehicles available in\nthe subscription catalogue, and the freedom offered\nto the user by this choice of financing \u2013 the luxury\nautomotive market\u2019s impressive customer retention\nis likely to grow further still if this turns out to be\neffective.\nHowever, there are examples of this model failing.\nWithin the automotive market itself, Mercedes and\nBMW are notable examples of companies that failed\nto expand beyond their pilot cities and ultimately\nshut down their schemes. Mercedes-Benz\u2019s Collection\nfailed to attract more than a few hundred clients, most\nof whom ended up using the same high-tier vehicles\nfor the duration of their subscriptions \u2013 the company\ncould have made more with a traditional lease model\nthat tied those customers in for greater periods of time.\nIt is clear, then, that the Alibaba Approach only works\nwhen certain conditions are met.\nThe recent SEC lecture series prompted me to\nthink more about a number of things, but perhaps\nmost notably the value of assets and how that can\nchange instantly. Maybe it would be best if everything\nwere bought and sold on an open stock market with\nindustry-specific regulations \u2013 moving to London for\na year? Buy shares in a house and stay in it until you\ndump them. Speculation in classic cars and pieces of\nart would become more like the syndicates system used\nfor racehorses, with prices less likely to skyrocket on\na whim. Those in the line of Adam Smith have long\nwished for a universal system like this, but it appears to\nbe genuinely feasible for large and valuable assets, even\nif it would be tedious to contend with such changes in\nthe price of a loaf of bread.\nFor now, it is clear that companies are making\nbolder moves into our lives than ever before, but\nperhaps we can learn from them and start trading in\nthings we have no right to own. After all, I would love\nto subscribe to Kensington Palace as long as I maintain\na controlling share in my next meal.\nOwnership will soon be a thing of the past...\nSo how did Alibaba\u2019s approach really work?\nNormally, a company that makes money tends to\nown the very thing it sells. Alibaba, however, has\nseen unprecedented growth in China and the western\nworld without owning much...

From smashing coffee cups in the morning to the eponymous Sonia\nand Masha bawling on the floor, worried that their life\nis devoid of meaning \u2013 the play touches on a lot of sentiments that university students feel.\nVanya and Sonia, captured beautifully by Michael\nMaloney and Rebecca Lacey, are 50-something-year-old siblings who live together in their parents\u2019 home.\nThey spent all their lives taking care of their parents\nand now that they\u2019ve passed away, the \u2018kids\u2019 (now mid-dle-aged adults, far from their prime), find themselves\nadrift with no career or purpose in life. That is, other than \u201cfeeling like a wild turkey\u201d.

This has meant that\nantiretroviral medication has become\nmuch scarcer, meaning many patients\npreviously on viral suppression therapy\nhavehadtogowithouttheirmedication.\nInterestingly though, the impact\nof COVID-19, while very real, has\nnot played as significant a role as\nclimate change. Drought, flooding,\nand changing weather has affected\ndisadvantaged communities, most of\nwhich are headed by women. Such\nfamilies are very dependent on weather\npatterns and climate to provide a source\nof income and food (often through crop\nyields such as sugarcane that can then\nbe sold or bartered). Climate change is\nmeaning that crop growth is becoming\nincreasingly less reliable as a source\nof food and income. This can lead to\nfamilies being displaced, as they move\nto metropolitan areas to look for work.\nThey live in squalor in shanty towns\nwith no access to basic amenities such as\nwater and sanitation. Often as a means\nto generate income, women will resort\nto sex work.\nAdditionally, Africa continues to\nexperience record levels of forced\ndisplacement. 32 million Africans\nare currently displaced as a result\nof predatory governments, political\nfragmentation, and violent extremist\ngroups.\nThese factors among others have had\na significant impact on the ongoing\nstruggle of HIV in Africa, and the\nonce upward trend of diagnosis, viral\nsuppression, and survival rates are\nslowing or stagnating at a concerning\nrate.\nA study presented at the 2021 HIV\nResearch for Prevention Convention,\nshowed that while more developed\nsub-Saharan countries such as South\nAfrica seem to be managing to contain\nthe spread of HIV, other less developed\nnations are showing alarming downward\ntrends, particularly in HIV testing as\nwell as condom use.\nThe co-author of this study,\nProfessor Stuart Gilmour of St. Luke\u2019s\nInternational University, Japan, said:\n\u201c\u2019This is important for African countries\nand citizens of those countries to\nunderstand since HIV is a major health\nconcern in Africa and it appears from\nourresultsthatmoreneedstobedoneto\ncontrol it\u2026 HIV cannot be eliminated\nwithout very high coverage of testing\nand low levels of behavioural risk\u2019\u2019.\nHe also criticized the international\ncommunity on their decisions to\nwithdraw from relief programs, saying,\n\u201cFrom an international perspective\nthe withdrawal of overseas aid and\ndevelopment assistance for health\ntargeting HIV/AIDS needs to be\nreconsidered\u2019\u2019.\nMichel Sidib\u00e9, Executive Director\nof UNAIDS emphasises that they are\nsounding the alarm. \u2018Entire regions are\nfalling behind, the huge gains made\nfor children are not being sustained,\nwomen are still most affected, and key\npopulations continue to be ignored.\u201d All\nthese elements are halting progress and\nurgently need to be addressed head on.\n\u2018We cannot have poor countries at the\nback of the queue.

Both\nHIV and COVID-19 must be fully\nfunded if we are to avoid massive loss of\nlife,\u201d says Winnie Byanyima, Executive\nDirector of UNAIDS.\nIt would appear that the developed\nworld is once again turning a blind eye\nto a continent that is, unfortunately, all\ntoo used to being ignored and exploited.\nWithout international aid returning to\nthe level it once was, it is likely these less\ndeveloped countries will slide back to a\nseriously dangerous condition, undoing\nalmost all of the good work that was\ndone to ease the situation across Africa.\n\u201cTHE\nWITHDRAWAL OF\nOVERSEAS AID AND\nDEVELOPMENT\nASSISTANCE\nFOR HEALTH\nTARGETING HIV/\nAIDS NEEDS TO BE\nRECONSIDERED\u201d\n\u201c\nWORLD AIDS DAY 2021 - WEDNESDAY 1ST\nDECEMBER\nWithWorldAIDSDaycomingupnextweek,whatcanyou\ndo, as a university student, to get involved?\n1) Education\nLearn more about the reality of living with HIV, and share what you\nlearnwithothers.TheQRcodebelowlinkstotheWHO\u2019spageonHIV/\nAIDS, where you can learn more about it.\n2) Societies\nUniversity societies can get involved too.

Academics from Bristol\nUniversity and Imperial College London say that psychotherapy conducted under the influence of MDMA could help patients process traumatic experiences. Psychotherapy is a treatment for alcoholism, but it\nis often limited by how comfortable patients feel discussing their traumatic experiences. MDMA decreases anxiety and depression, and its\nmild stimulators effect via norepinephrine and dopamine could motivate patients to engage during therapy. Psychotherapy would allow patients to process their emotions so they do not relapse every time they\nthink about the traumatic event. Whilst the study could not estimate the\ntreatment\u2019s efficacy with the control group, 8 weeks after the treatment,\nonly 21% of participants reported drinking above 14 units of alcohol\nper week, compared with 76% of those who had psychotherapy alone.\nContinued from page 8...\nFirstly, mitochondria can synthesize\ntheir own proteins using a type of organelles called ribosomes.

The path and\nsurrounding areas are lit up by ground\nlights which will provide illumination\nfor people using the path after sunset.\nEffort has been made to remove\nunnecessary changes in levels, making\nthe whole plaza more accessible to\neveryone.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nCharles Darwin, the author of On\nthe Origin of Species, shaped our\ninterpretation of the origin and evolution of life from a fixed perspective\nto a scientific and dynamic one. The\nevolution of life is a slow and gradual\nprocess established on natural selection,\nwhich in simpler words is the survival of\nthe fittest for a particular environment.\nThese ideas are often misinterpreted,\ngenerating an extreme view of nature as\na merciless competition. However, there\nare many examples of cooperation, such\nas lichens or insect colonies. Dividing\nthe tasks makes the organisms specialise\nin one task in particular, so they perform better. For example, in lichens, the\nfungus provides nutrients to the alga\nand this in return, shares a part of the\nsugars it produces from photosynthesis.\nIf the idea of cooperation can be applied\nto the multicellular world, why can\u2019t\nthe same principle be applicable on a\ncellular level?\nDuring the 19th century, a controversial debate was happening around\nthe world. How did the eukaryotic cell\nfirst appear on Earth? Not surprisingly,\nthe theories of eukaryotes\u2019 origins were\ninfluenced by Darwinism. However, as\nmentioned earlier, cooperation occurs in\nnature and is often beneficial. Therefore,\nsome scientists were advocating for a disruptive theory called\nsymbiogenesis. Its\nprinciple exponent\nwas Lynn Margulis,\nwhose paper, On the\nMitosing of the Cells,\nparallels Darwin\u2019s\nbook, On the Origin\nof Species, in terms of\ninfluence and inno-vation.\nSymbiogenesis or\nthe endosymbiotic\ntheory suggests that\neukaryotic cells came\nfrom symbiotic relationships between\nancient prokaryotic\ncells.Aroundtwobil-lion years ago, the atmosphere of the Earth changed. Ancient\ncyanobacteria started releasing millions\nof tonnes of oxygen to the atmosphere\nrapidly due to one\nof the most important innovations\nin life: photosyn-thesis. Most cells\nwere heterotrophs\n(organisms that\nfeed on other or-ganisms). Oxygen\nwas toxic for them,\ncausing a mass extinction across the\nglobe. In those\ntimes, most organisms employed\ninefficient anaerobic respiration\npathways such as\nfermentation or\nglycolysis to produce ATP, the energetic currency of\nthe cell. However, some oxidative bacteria developed a\nmechanism called aerobic cellular respiration that uses the excessive oxygen\navailable to produce ATP. From a single\nmolecule of glucose, the yield of glycolysis is only 2 ATP, whilst cellular respiration is 36 ATP.\nThe theory suggests that some\ncells could catch\nand digest smaller organisms by\na process called\nphagocytosis\nwhich involves\ndeforming their\nm e m b r a n e s\nand forming digestive vesicles\nto contain the\n\u201cfood\u201d. Phagocytosis is a type\nof endocytosis;\nthis is where the\nname \u2018endosymbiotic theory\u2019\ncomes from. Endocytosis, in a nutshell,\nis the introduction of substances from\noutside into the cell. At some point, a\npredatory cell trapped an oxidative bacterium through phagocytosis, but the\nengulfed bacterium was not digested,\nas would usually happen. Now, the new\nenvironment of the oxidative bacterium\nwas the cytoplasm of another cell, from\nwhich it was able to receive resources for\nits own chemical reactions, and produce\nATP for both itself and its former pred-ator, now also known as the host cell,\nestablishing a mutualistic relationship\nbetween them. The host cell provided\nthe oxidative bacterium nutrients and\nprotection in exchange for energy. Endosymbiotic theory (and it is just that\n- a theory) suggests that this started a\nprocess of coevolution which ended up\nwith the modern eukaryotic cell and the\nmitochondrion, respectively. This relatively sudden cooperation changed the\nrules of the games. As the host cell had\na surplus of energy, it could increase its\nmotility, which allowed it to take more\nresources from the environment than its\ncompetitor, and have enough energy to\ncarry out a greater variety of actions. The\nincrease in the energy and material available for the host cell allowed it to form\nnon-membranous and membranous organelles over time. These had their own\nspaces and were responsible for different\ntasks inside the cell. The eukaryotic cell\nhas emerged, life is compartmentalising,\nbut what happened to the ancient oxidativecell\u2013probably,an\u03b1-proteobacteria?\nWith time and through the accumula-tionofmutations,theindependentiden-tity of the oxidative bacterium gradually\ndisappeared; they started behaving more\nlike an intrinsic part of the cell, forming\nthe mitochondrion. Indeed, this organelle has its own DNA, but over time it\nhas been diminishing and many of the\ngenes it codified are now transferred to\nthe nucleus of the eukaryotic cell. Plastids are also an example of symbiogen-esis. They are exclusive to plant cells,\nincluding the chloroplast, which realise\nphotosynthesis, and seem to evolve from\nancient cyanobacteria because both of\nthem share a similar internal organisa-tion.\nFirst, it assumes that an oxidative\nprokaryote was not \u201cmiraculously\u201d digested by a bigger one. Second, phagocytosis was instrumental in the incorporation of the oxidative bacterium into the\nhost cell, but the deformation of the cell\nmembrane required a lot of ATP. Evolution is constant and the advantage of a\nparticular trait can increase or decrease\ndepending on the environmental chang-es.\nThe symbiosis theory demonstrates\nhow living beings will do everything in\ntheir power, including working together,\nto survive. There is more than enough\nevidence to strongly support that the endosymbiotic theory is true.\nContinued on page 9...\nEndosymbiotic Theory\nThe origins of the eukaryotic cell and comparisons between the Margulis\u2019 and Darwin\u2019s\nunderstanding of evolution.\nWang Guo Science Staff Writer\nENDOSYMBIOTIC\nTHEORY SUGGESTS\nTHAT EUKARYOTIC\nCELLS CAME\nFROM SYMBIOTIC\nRELATIONSHIPS\nBETWEEN ANCIENT\nPROKARYOTIC\nCELLS\n\u201c\nWRITE FOR\nSCIENCE!\nIf the article above has got you\ninterested in writing about issues\nor anecdotes from the fields of\ncomputer science, mathematics,\nengineering or the natural\nsciences, please email us at:\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "As soon as The Backseat Lovers announced a gig in\nthe UK, I had reminders set for the ticket release\ntime. Getting tickets to a gig is a much less stressful experience in London than at my home in Yorkshire. It\nwas easy to get to MOTH Club in Hackney, with no\njourney planning needed, compared to going to gigs\nin Yorkshire where you must meticulously plan trains\nto make sure you don\u2019t get stranded an\nhour\u2019s drive from home.\nIt was also easy to find people who\nwanted to go, which is unsurprising\nconsidering the band\u2019s reputation of\nenergetic live shows that had so far\nbeen confined to North America. After\nTuesday November 16th 2021, this\nwas no longer the case. The Backseat\nLovers have crossed the Atlantic and provided a lucky\n300 people with what I think was one of the best gigs\nI\u2019ve ever been to.\nAbout halfway through the set,with a phrase I\u2019m\nsure he tells all his crowds, lead singer Josh Harmon\nproclaimed, \u201cthis is the coolest day of my life\u201d. It\nlooked like he meant it as he belted out lyrics together\nwith a crowd that seemed to know every single word\nto every single song, a skill that seemed to impress the\nwhole band. Considering the stereotypes of American\ncrowds being calmer than British\nones, I\u2019m not surprised by the\nexcitement that could be seen on\nthe band\u2019s faces when the whole\nroom started singing along to the\nopening song of the set, \u2018Just A\nBoy\u2019. By the second song, \u2018Pool\nHouse\u2019, Harmon was turning the\nmic to the crowd and grinning as\nwe did his job for him.\nHaving almost exclusively\nattended gigs in Leeds and\nNewcastle, I was sceptical of\nSouthern crowds when I first\nmoved to London, and after a few\nunderwhelming efforts I thought I\nwas proven right. However, after tonight I will gladly\nadmit I was wrong. Southerners have been redeemed.\nThe crowd only got more involved as the set went on\nand the band played their hits \u2018Kilby Girl\u2019 and \u2018Out Of\nTune\u2019, with an energy that built on their\nalready bouncing recorded versions.\nAswellasprovidingLondonwiththeir\nbiggestsongs,thebandalsoplayedanew\ntrack from their as-of-yet-unannounced\nnew album. Titled \u2018Slowing Down\u2019, it\ndid just that. A calming, twinkly guitar\nand vocal verse relaxed the crowd and as\nalways,thesongbuiltupandspotlighted\nHarmon\u2019s incredibly strong vocals. The release date\nof the song wasn\u2019t revealed by the band despite the\nconstant requests of another fan to my right.\nAs the set came to an end, and before the band even\ngot a chance to fully get off the stage, calls for one\nmore song began and eventually the crowd descended\ninto screaming for their own favourite (and as-yet-unplayed) songs to fill the short time the band still had\nto perform. However, when the deep, hypnotising first\nnotesof \u2018SinkingShip\u2019beganno-onewasdisappointed.\nAlthough there were no chants\nof \u201cYorkshire\u201d and Londoners seem\nto love clapping along to almost\nevery song at gigs, I witnessed one\nof and if not the best gigs of my life\nprovided by The Backseat Lovers. If\nyou haven\u2019t already, listen to them\nand wait patiently for them to come\nback to the UK, which I\u2019m sure\nthey\u2019ll be in a rush to do after that\nperformance.\nSET LIST\nIntro Jam\nJust a Boy\nPool House\nPictures\nHeavy\nKilby Girl\nDrugout\nOut of Tune\nInterlude Jam\nSlowing Down\nMaple Syrup\nStill a Friend\nSinking Ship\nFRIDAY 26TH NOVEMBER 2021\n23\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\nTHIS IS THE\nCOOLEST DAY\nOF MY LIFE\nwithout some divine guitar parts, and Vanderkooy\nprovides in the form of a slide guitar riff that adds to\nthe idea of road trips and travelling through the vast\ncountryside. As well as creating room for the vocals to\nshine, the stripped back track creates a personal feel\nthat is also explored in the lyrics. Each verse starts with\nthe titular phrase, \u201clook out\u201d and seems to be talking to\na different audience each time, including the listener in\nthe second verse. I hope this new experimentation of\ndifferent arrangements and ideas while staying within\nthe unique sound of the band is continued throughout\nthe upcoming album.\nSpeaking of the album, From 2 to 3 is set to be\nreleased on March 4th 2022 and will be Peach Pit\u2019s 3rd\nstudio album.

    "content": "Women shouldn\u2019t feel obliged to buy the freedom to walk around without fear.\nI\u2019m writing this piece primarily about\nwomen\u2019s safety on the streets, but\nalso as another response to the comment piece \u2018Is Modern-Day Feminism\nFlawed?\u2019, which was published in Issue\n1781.\nFirst of all, the issue of women\u2019s safe-ty, and how it\u2019s being addressed \u2013 a hot\ntopic right now due to the increasing\nnumber of injected spikings being reported on nights out. Spiking in itself\nis a horrendous concept; that people\nwould even consider poisoning others in\norder to take advantage of them is des-picable. The recent injections that have\nbeen administered to many women and\ngirls on nights out are even worse. It is\nalmost impossible\nfor a woman to protect herself against\nsuch a predator during tightly packed\nevents in which\nboth strangers and\nfriends are min-gling.\nIt is infuriating\nthat in the past, and\nsometimes in the\npresent as well, the\nexcuses for women being harassed,\nabused, raped, and\neven murdered,\nhave been that they\nwere wearing too\nlittle, or asking\nfor it, or that they\nshouldn\u2019t have been\nintoxicated. A couple standout reports this year include\nSarah Everard, who was falsely arrested,\nthen raped, strangled, and burned to ash\nby a police officer, and Sabina Nessa,\nkilled and left in a park. Both incidents\noccurred on short walks to or from\nhome. The tables have turned slightly in\nsuch cases, with blame shifting marginally towards perpetrators and victims\ngiven a little more support, but this isn\u2019t\nenough to keep women safe in the fu-ture.\nOf course, these cases do not apply\nstrictly to the female race, although\nthere is an overwhelming skew towards\nus. I won\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m not focusing on women in writing this piece ei-ther, but as a feminist myself, I am also\ntaking into consideration the rights of\ncountless other non-binary, and male,\npeople who have to endure the same\nhardships. However, part of the reason\nwhy feminism focuses on women is that\nto reach gender equality, we are, along\nwith non-binary people, the gender that\nrequires more support.\nFurthermore, the patriarchy is not\na whimsical concept created by femi-nists, as the writer\nof the aforementioned article seems\nto believe, but an\ningrained system of\nhierarchies and values that allow men\nto get away with and\nachieve much more\nthan women in gen-eral. Fighting this in\nno way implies that\nALL men escape\nhardship, but simply aims for gender\nequality in as many\nareas of life as pos-sible. This argument\nwas explained in Issue 1782\u2019s \u2018Is Modern-Day Sexism\nFlawed\u2019, and Issue\n1783\u2019s \u2018Men\u2019s Issues\nare Real\u2019, and it could be extended and\nexplained much further, but back to my\noriginal topic:\nWomen have gone to many lengths to\nprotect themselves and others through\nbuying products such as rape whistles\nand alarms, concealed stun guns and\npepper sprays, scrun-chie drinks covers,\nself-defense rings, and\neven plastic \u2018knuckles\u2019 for shoes. The\nlist goes on, and yet,\ndrink spikers have risen above and beyond\nto find a way to dodge\nall of these devices.\nMany women have\nalso taken to catching taxis, Ubers, and\nBolts more frequently in order to avoid\nthe dangers of taking public transport\nor walking outside at night. A non-prof-it organization has even been launched\nvia Instagram (@homesafeldn) that is\naccepting donations on GoFundMe.\ncom to help women pay for this transportation \u2013 a valiant gesture in theory,\nbutthenagain,howmanyofthosedona-tions will come from other women? It is\nalsonotafailsafesolution,asbeingalone\nin a private car with a stranger driving it\ncan turn out to be just as dangerous as\nbeing alone on the streets. During 2017\nand 2018, Uber recorded that they had\nreceived nearly 6000 sexual assault reports in the U.S. (with passengers being\nthe victim on most occasions).\nThe heartbreaking reality is a vicious\ncycle of oppression, in which the more\noutrageous the reported incidents be-come, the more important it is to hide\nout and protect ourselves from having\nthe same thing happen to us. But women can\u2019t hide forever and we should be\nfree to go out at any time of day without feeling unsafe. There is even an argument that the recent university boycotts\nof clubs plays right into the hands of\nour oppressors. Apparently the current\n\u2018solution\u2019 to this is to feed money into\nthe economy out of our own pockets (or\nbagsandpursessincefemalesaregeneral-lynotaffordedtheluxuryofpockets;an-other ruse to drain our bank accounts).\nWhen will the world realise that safety\ncan\u2019t continue to be sold commercially,\nand we should instead be trying to combat the root of the problem?\nEducation in feminism and women\u2019s\nrights at a young age needs to be much\nmore concrete, explaining what exactly \u2018feminism\u2019 means, how to recognise\nwhen it is reasonable and when it isn\u2019t,\nand showing how we should be treating\nwomen, and others in general. Feminism, put simply, is supporting women\u2019s\nrights so that we may be held to the same\nstandard as men \u2013 not above them. The\nterm is partially misleading, however if\none took the time to understand what it\nstemsfrom,itisshockingthattheycould\nbelieve radicalism is the same thing as\nregular feminism.\nI firmly believe that educating young\npeople in their treatment of others is the\nmost efficient route to, not only a more\ngender-equal society, but one more\namenable to racial and cultural equality\nas well. There are an endless number of\nfemale (and non-female!) tribulations\nin our current society, and it would take\nmany pages of writing to fully argue\nthe validity of these, but I hope to have\nmade at least a small dent in the discussion about women\u2019s rights.\nStop Selling Us Our Safety\nZannaBuckland\nBooksEditor\nFRIDAY 26TH NOVEMBER 2021\n30\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment Have an article in mind?\nEmail your idea or piece to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWHEN WILL THE\nWORLD REALISE\nTHAT SAFETY\nCAN\u2019T CONTINUE\nTO BE SOLD\nCOMMERCIALLY,\nAND WE SHOULD\nINSTEAD BE\nTRYING TO\nCOMBAT THE\nROOT OF THE\nPROBLEM?\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Filip Mroz on Unsplash\nA woman walking alone at night.\nThis is the third counter-argument to the issue\n1781 comment article titled: \u2018Is Modern-Day Feminism Flawed?\u2019\nPlease visit the comment section of the website at\nfelixonline.co.uk if you wish to read the original\narticle and the past two responses.\nIf you would like to join the discourse, email us at\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "COP26 in Glasgow started and\nended in the same way \u2013 optimism tinged with a sense of inaction.\nHordes of world leaders and famous\nfaces descended upon the Scottish city,\nwith impassioned speeches trying to\nset the tone for a conference many had\ndescribed as the last chance to control\nrunaway climate change. Sir David\nAttenborough, in his powerful ad-dress, told the room that the world was\nlooking at them to work together and\nrewrite the future.\nTheproblemwiththisspeechwasthat\nsome of the most important people in\nthe world were not in the room to hear\nit. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping chose to\nremaininChina,asdidRussia\u2019sVladimir\nPutin and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro.\nTogether, these countries symbolise\nsomeofthebiggestchallengesinthepath\ntonetzero\u2013cleaningupmanufacturing,\nreducing dependence on fossil fuels, and\nending rampant deforestation. Their\nabsence was not a good omen for the\nconference, and the agreements signed\nhave undoubtedly suffered as a result.\nThe conference itself was questioned\nby some climate campaigners. President\nJoe Biden made his way to Scotland on\nhis private 747, travelling to the climate\nconference in a motorcade made up of\n25heavyAmericanSUVsflownspecially\nfrom the United States. He did not stay\nfor long, as the US President obviously\ncannot be seen negotiating at a summit\nthat Xi Jinping has refused to attend\n\u2013 he made the return journey back to\nWashington after attending just two\ndays of the fifteen-day summit. While\nhe was here, he joined about 30,000\ndelegates flown in from around the\nworld at great expense\u2014both financial\nand environmental. Some of these\ndelegates were hosted on two cruise\nships hired specially for the occasion,\nseemingly by someone with a twisted\nsense of humour, considering cruise\nships are effectively floating climate\ndisasters. Never one to miss out on a\nchance to embarrass the UK publicly,\nPM Boris Johnson admitted he would\nbe flying back to London rather than use\nthe train. In a world that has learned to\nmeet virtually, it feels strange to try and\nsave the planet at a conference that is\nestimated to have emitted over 100,000\ntonnes of CO2\nin just two weeks \u2013\nmore than the emissions of 250,000\nUK residents in the same time period.\nFortunately, some agreements were\nstruck that will more than offset this.\nThe first pledge was made on the second\nday of the conference, with over 100\ncountries agreeing to reduce methane\nemissions by 30% by 2030. While the\ntotal reduction is not exactly ambitious,\nitisneverthelessanimportantfactorthat\nwill contribute towards overall climate\ngoals,asmethaneisagreenhousegasthat\nis approximately 85 times more potent\nat trapping heat than CO2 while in the\natmosphere. This agreement should\nfunction as a way of measuring how\nserious signatories are about adhering\nto commitments they have made, with\nthe short nine-year timespan meaning\nsignificant progress should be visible\nin a short timescale. The majority of\nmethane emissions are concentrated and\nwell known \u2013 for example leaky natural\ngas equipment and landfills\u2014and as\nsuch improvements should be easy to\nimplement. While not legally binding,\nthis is a commitment that most should\nachieve without further persuasion.\nSome countries have gone beyond the\n30% number, with Canada promising\na 75% reduction by 2030. This,\nunfortunately, will not be enough to\nmake up for the list of notable absences,\nincluding Russia, China, India, and\nAustralia,whomakeupasizeableportion\nof worldwide methane emissions.\nThe second day of COP26 brought\nanother welcome announcement. 141\ncountries,coveringmorethan90%ofthe\nworld\u2019s forests, agreed to end and even\nreverse deforestation by 2030. While\na 2014 attempt at a similar agreement\nfailed rather miserably, this agreement\nhas several crucial differences. Despite\nthe absence of Presidents Bolsonaro,\nPutin and Jinping\u2014or perhaps because\nof it\u2014this new agreement has been\nsigned by Brazil, Russia and China,\nall of whom have been cutting down\nvast swathes of their forests. \u00a314\nbillion of financing has already been\ncommitted to support the transition\nfor developing countries, with plans for\ndirect payments to countries such as\nIndonesia and the Congo in return for\nprotecting their forests. Governments\nhave also received support from private\ncorporations in this agreement, with\nmore than thirty financial institutions\nagreeing to end investment in\nactivities that lead to deforestation.\nSome financial institutions have also\nagreed to consider the environment\nwhen planning their investments. Firms\ncontrolling \u00a395 trillion of assets\u201440%\nof the global total\u2014have said they\nwill \u2018align themselves\u2019 with the Paris\nAgreement, aiming to limit warming to\n1.5C.Whilethishasclearlybeendonefor\nselfish reasons\u2014green investments have\nbeen performing better than traditional\ninfrastructure and will eventually be the\nonly option\u2014it is still a net benefit to us\nall, as there is now more capital available\nto deploy technologies that will help in\nthetransitiontonetzero.Theagreement\nhas been signed by a voluntary and\nself-regulated group known as the\n\u2018Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net\nZero\u2019 and is completely non-binding.\nHowever, it is hoped that the sheer\nmomentum of these firms turns their\npromise into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nThe next major agreement took some\ntime, but it was a pleasant surprise\nwhen it finally came. The USA and\nChina, in a rare joint declaration,\ncommitted to working together in\norder to achieve the 1.5C goal set in\nthe Paris Agreement. Nothing specific\nwas mentioned, possibly due to the\nabsence of both countries\u2019 leaders, but\nthe very fact that they have committed\nto collaboration going forward is cause\nto celebrate. A war of egos between\nthese two superpowers would have been\ndisastrous for the rest of the world, as\nboth countries have a vital role to play\nin how we all transition to net zero. A\nvirtual summit between the two leaders\nhas been scheduled, and this will play an\nimportant role in the legacy of COP26.\nCOP26 came to a rather\nunderwhelming conclusion, with the\nfinal day\u2019s headline agreement being\naggressively passive in its wording.\nThe first statement was that all parties\nshould pledge to cut their emissions\nfurther \u2013 after meeting again next year.\nWhile yearly meetings are a good way\nof allowing the public and the rest of\nthe world to police a country\u2019s climate\ncommitments, delaying the first round\nof promises feels like a pointless move.\nCurrent agreements will only limit\nwarming to 2.4C, well beyond what\nis considered disastrous. Developed\ncountries agreed to significantly increase\nfunding available to poorer states to aid\nthem in their transition to net zero. This\nis not legally binding, and considering\nthat total funds provided have not yet\nreached the lower previously-agreed\nnumber, developing nations are not\ndelighted at this deal. In another\npromise with no weight, countries\nagreed to end subsidies for fossil fuels,\nwith no deadline for them to do so.\nThe final, controversial agreement was\na statement to \u2018phase down\u2019 coal use,\nwith the phrase replacing \u2018phase out\u2019 in\nthe final hours of the conference after\na late intervention by China and India,\nanother unlikely partnership. The move\ndrew widespread criticism, but is an\nunderstandable one that deserves to\nbe considered beyond the headlines.\nIt is important to not forget what has\nhappened at COP26. In a year\u2019s time,\nCOP27 will be held in Egypt, and it is\nimperative that pressure is maintained\non governments and companies.\nChange will only happen if the decision\nmakers feel it is the best option for them\npersonally\u2014not for the planet\u2014and so\npoliticiansandbrandsmustbereminded\nthat this is something important.\nWhat has COP26 achieved?\nBohra Shrey Sustainability Writer\nFRIDAY, 26TH NOVEMBER 2021\n13\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie mori\nMonika yordanova\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nARTS\nCredits: The State Hermitage Museum\nThe last few decades of the Romanov dynasty\nand late-nineteenth early twentieth century\nRussia is one of aberrant dichotomy. The Empire was at its strongest yet and was even beating the\nBritish at their own game of diplomacy with The Great\nGame in Central Asia, and yet it had only just been\nserved with an upset-loss in the Russo-Japanese war of\n1905. Opulence bustled in St. Petersburg and Moscow\nand yet, discontent and revolution was brewing in the\ncountryside. And within a couple of decades with the\nturn of the century, starting with the Potemkin muti-ny, the 300-year-old dynasty would meet a sudden and\nrapid death.\nIt was in such a climate, when opulence and dismay\nwere both equal food for thought for the Russian pop-ulace, that a jeweller by the name of Gustave Faberge\nenamoured the ruling class of Europe with his art-istry. Perfecting what was, until then, a tradition\ninto a respectable vocation and profession,\nFaberge become a common place name synonymous with excellence. With a workshop\nin Russia working like clockwork and by\ndrawing on Russia\u2019s vast natural resource;\nFaberge carved out an empire in jewellery\nthat has indeed stood the test of time,\neven if the enterprise he built didn\u2019t\noutlast the Romanovs for much longer\n(he died in 1920 in Switzerland having\nfled Russia after the Romanovs\u2019 fall).\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s\nlatest exhibition, \u2018Faberge: From Romance to Revolution\u2019 showcases some\nof the best artistry from that genera-tioninwhatisthelargestexhibitionon\nthe famed jeweller in well over a gener-ation. Featuring multiple effects drawn\nfromtheStateMuseumsofRussia(many\npossible for the first time since the end of\nthe Cold War) and anonymous donors,\nincluding arguably the headline-grabbing\nhighlight of 15 Easter eggs, the exhibition is\nelaborate in telling the story of how Faberge set\nup an empire in jewellery and the story of its exuberant clientele all the way from Russia to London\nvia Paris.\nThe repertoire here is without a doubt exhaustive.\nWe see numerous artefacts, including cigarette cases\nand personal effects that adorned the purses of famous\nfolk, from the King of England to the granddaughter\nof Marshal Murat. Bookkeeping from the workshop\nhighlight the detailed plans that Faberge and his artists\nmade for their clients; the detail and orthodoxy of the\ndocumentation looks to be from another age altogeth-er.\nThe exhibition is also one of many firsts. The reunited Cossacks, mini figurines of the household guard\nof the Romanovs (lost since the revolution, only to be\nre-discovered in the attic of a Manhattan apartment in\n2013) are displayed here for the first time in over 100\nyears.\nFaberge had a workshop in Russia and a highly\nsought-after shop in London to cater to the far-flung\nclientele (which included Maharajas from\nIndia and the future King of Siam). His\nworkshop was run by talented artisan\nfamilies like the Holstrom! This enterprise angle is not amiss in the exhibition and together one can really sense\nthevisionandgrandiosityofFaberge;\none that was cut short by the advent\nof WW1 and the collapse of the\nEmpire soon after.\nThe fifteen Easter eggs,\nthe highlight of any exhibition on jewellery, sit in a\nsingle room at the end of\nthe exhibition. Arranged\nin a honeycomb fashion\nforcing us (the audi-ence) to dance around\nto view them. I will\nsave any description\nof them here as arguably in my opinion,\nthere aren\u2019t enough\nwords to praise\nthem in them in\nthis review. Only\nthat their allure is\nso strong that, being\nsurrounded by the\nopulence and craft\nof these eggs, for one\nmoment transports us\nto a more exotic setting,\nperhaps in one of the state\nrooms of the Hermitage, and\nwefeellikewearetheRomano-vs in that instance. The winter\negg is, in particular, a spectacle that is able to capture\nthe Russian ethos and milieu even when viewed a century later.\nIn the beginning of the exhibition, we see household items of the Romanov\u2019s presented, including\npersonnal jewellery, study books, cigarette cases, the\nreunited Cossacks, and clocks that must have adorned\ntheir private quarters in the Hermitage. The exhibition\nstrikesamaster-strokehereinbyhanginglargeportraits\nand photographs of the Romanov\u2019s brood over these\nexhibits looking down on us. They seem like common\nfolk going about their lives \u2014 and Tsar Nicholas holds\nthe withdrawn look that has come to symbolise the\nman who owned the world... and lost it in the blink\nof the eye. Princess Tatiana looks us at \u2014 a mere 23\nyears old when she was shot dead \u2014 as we peer at her\nnecklace, snatched from her before the firing squad did\ntheir \u2018duty\u2019. We watch their personal effects and won-der, whilst they probably watch and wonder too! This\npoignancy amazingly captures the tone of the rest of\nthe exhibition and Faberge\u2019s work itself \u2014 amazing\nworks of art caught up in a turbulent time, destined\nonly for disappointment in a short turn.\nGo for the jewels and you would not be disappoint-ed. Only, amidst the glitter and glory of these pieces\ndon\u2019t forget that there is a story behind as well. A sad\nstory that only the Romanovs and Faberges of the\nworld knew too well.
