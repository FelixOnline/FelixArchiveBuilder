In truth, you\u2019ve got until 30 April to complete it, but you might as\nwell do it now, right?\nThe NSS asks you to rate the extent to which you agree with 27\nstatements grouped into 9 subject areas such as teaching on your\ncourse, the support you received from staff members and the\nresources you were given to support your learning. You will also be able\nto highlight any particular positive or negative aspects on your student\nexperience.\nIf you have something to say, would like to influence your own\nand others\u2019 experience at Imperial, complete the survey at www.\nthestudentsurvey.com.\nComplete the NSS! The Sexual Misconduct Survey\nLast year, the Union teamed up with ICUsToo (Imperial\u2019s campaign group\nagainst sexual violence) on an unprecedented project at Imperial: to\ncreate an anonymous survey which gauges the prevalence of sexual\nmisconduct at Imperial, the degree to which students feel able to access\nsupport, and the situations in which it occurs most often.\nOver a period of 1 month over the summer of 2021, we gained over 600\nresponses. The perspective that they shared was heart-wrenching but\nnot altogether surprising.\n\u2022 30.8% of respondents reported having personally experienced\nsexual harassment. Of these respondents, 84.2% were women.\n\u2022 15.0% of respondents reported having personally experienced\nsexual violence. Of these respondents, 87.5% were women.\n\u2022 Students with disabilities are more likely than able-bodied students\nto experience both sexual harassment and sexual violence.\n\u2022 Union bars, off-campus socials and halls of residence are the top\nthree venues in which sexual misconduct takes place.\n\u2022 Only 18.7% of survivors sought the help of support services at\nImperial College. The most named reason for not seeking support is\nthat they did not think that any action would be taken.\nNow that we have a much-needed understanding of where the problem\nareas are, the Union will take steps to action the recommendations\nwhich are outlined in the report. This will involve liaising with the College\non their communications, working with Student Services to improve the\naccessibility and visibility of support services, and taking part in a full\nreview of the College\u2019s Student Disciplinary Procedures. We need to work\ntogether to ensure that survivors feel heard and supported and create a\nculture of respect for consent.\nIf you want to read the survey report you can find it on our website in DP\nWelfare\u2019s latest blog.\nYour Union\nA significant number\nof sexual misconduct\nat Imperial are\nheterosexual women\nUnion Bars were\nselected as the most\ncommon venue for\nsexual harassment\n\n"

This\nisaninalienablefactatthispoint,with\ndailycasesatalmostathirdofthepeak\nin early January and hospitalisations\nbroadly not coming close to\noverwhelming the NHS (though there\nwas and is significant variation\nby geography). Even SAGE\u2019s\nown minutes state that \u2018A\ndecreasing proportion of\nthoseinhospitalrequireICU\nadmission, which suggests\nthat the reduction in\nseverity if measured\nby ICU admission risk\nis even greater than the\nreduction when measured by\nhospital admission risk\u2019 and\nthat \u2018An increasing proportion of\n[hospital]admissionsarepositivetests\namongst people admitted primarily\nfor reasons other than COVID-19\u2019.\n\u201cOmicron is in retreat\u201d said Saj.\nProfessorofPublicHealthatNewcastle\nUniversity Allyson Pollock called the\nplans \u201cvery sensible\u201d. \u201cThe situation\nprovides a case for lifting restrictions\u201d\nsaid Prof Francois Balloux of UCL.\nBut this is only one side of the story.\nOn Saturday, The Times published an\narticle titled \u2018Warring scientists fight\non as Omicron retreats\u2019. Within this\npiece there were conflicting opinions\nfrom scientists and politicians alike\nover the lifting of Plan B. Dr Stephen\nGriffin of the University of Leeds was\napparantly \u201caghast\u201d at the lifting of\nrestrictions at this point. The Times\u2019\narticle also included an Omicron\nspreadmodel,developedbyUniversity\nof Warwick. The least severe outcome\nof Omicron\u2019s spread suggested by\nthe model was still more severe\nthat what was actually experienced.\nGovernment adviser Adam Finn\nsaid \u2018I often find myself trying to\ncommunicate uncertainty and\nend up being attacked from both\nsides by \u201cthe convinced\u201d\u2019. MP and\nformer science teacher Miriam\nCates said \u201cI can see the appeal of\nthe term \u2018following the science\u2019 to\npoliticians, but it has wrongly led\npeople to believe that the science\nof the pandemic is black or white\u201d.\nCome this Monday, and the\nIndependent\u2019s Samuel Lovett (not me)\nhas written an article titled \u2018Attacks\nagainst Covid modellers undermine\nfuture pandemic response\u2019. Having\nbeen accused of creating a \u2018climate\nof manipulated fear\u2019, some SAGE\nscientists said they \u2018fear such attacks\nwill weaken trust in the modelling and\nhinder decision-making\nin the face of dangerous\nnew Covid variants\nor future pandemics\u2019,\naccording to the\nIndependent. The kicker\ncame from one Professor\nGraham, who said he\nwas concerned that such\nattacks on Covid models\nwould lead to an \u201cerosion of trust\u201d\nin them, adding \u201cyou already have\nthat in terms of vaccinations\u201d. And\nthus, noticing that a model is wrong\nis equated with being anti-vax.\nThese models were largely wrong.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t\na great help or that they\u2019ll never be\nbetter in the future. But there are\ncosts to increased restrictions, which\nare so often not considered (or at\nleast not spoken about) by public\nhealth scientists. The NHS was not\nstretched this winter by a huge wave\nof Covid patients, but because it\nwas so understaffed when 120,000\nstaff were off in a single week, after\ncontracting the disease or having\nbeen a close contact. Calls to reduce\nisolation periods aim to reduce\nthis pressure, which is something\nthat doesn\u2019t seem to cross the mind\nof many who are pro-restriction.\nI also want to add that Dr Simon\nClarke of the University or Reading\nbizzarely finished his statement on the\nremoval of Plan B restrictions, quoted\non the Science Media Centre website,\nbysaying\u201cit\u2019simpossiblenottosuspect\nthat the nation\u2019s health is not the\nonly factor ministers are taking into\nconsideration\u201d.

    "content": "Euphoria is a HBO television series\nthat follows the fast-paced lives\nof high school students in a suburban\ntown. Euphoria premiered in June 2019,\nand it very quickly became a hit series,\nwiththeshowwinning15ofits47award\nnominations. Most notably, lead actress\nZendaya Coleman won the award for\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Drama\nSeries in the 2020 Emmys, which, at the\nage of 24, made her the youngest actress\nto win the accolade in the award history.\nI was also delighted to see British musician Labrinth pick up the Creative Arts\nEmmy for Outstanding Original Music\nand Lyrics because the soundtrack he\nproduced for the series was simply sub-lime.\nThe series itself was a whirlwind, with\nthe \u201cDanny Elfman meets Yeezus meets\nGospel\u201d music, stylish characters, and\ndreamy visuals, juxtaposed by the dark,\nraw storylines. A combination that undoubtedly helped pull in viewers who\nwere attracted to the aesthetics of youth\nbut were seeking a teenage drama that\ndid not shy away from controversial\nthemes. See, Euphoria is roughly what\nSkins was, if you were to remove the\ngrittiness that came with a mid-2000s\nshow set in Bristol. That said, Euphoria\nwas based off a 2012 Israeli mini-series\nof the same name, and it was this show\nthat was inspired by Skins. Just like its\noriginal and Skins, Euphoria is very ex-plicit, and uncensored in the depiction\nof teenager\u2019s relationships, addictions,\ninsecurities, and flaws.\nThis unfiltered approach to adolescence is appreciated by some, but naturally there were critics who questioned\nwhether it was appropriate to depict\nteenagers in such explicit and mature\ncontent. Three years ago, I somewhat\ndisagreed with such criticism. At the\ntime, I thought I appreciated the \u2018realism\u2019 of such content. Yet now, after almost three years, the show has returned\nto the streaming world, and I have decided that I will not be watching it this\ntime.\nIn the three-year gap between season\none and two, I grew from a 19-year-old\nto a 21-year-old woman. A small jump\nin age, but for me it was years of mental,\nemotional, and (admittedly very little)\nphysical growth. So, in that time, I gravitated away from media that centred on\nteenagers. If I do watch any coming-of-age content, they tend to be films or series I watched when I was a teenager, so\nthe appeal is more nostalgic for me. At\nthisage,itfeelsoddtoconsumenewme-dia that is for teenagers and about teen-agers; especially as teenage representation is becoming increasingly mature\nin its nature. So, after I came across the\ntrailer for season two of Euphoria, the\nthought of watching adult actors, who\nhad also aged three years since season\none, pretending to be 17 to 18-year-olds\nprompted me to ask myself: \u201cwho is this\nshow for?\u201d\nWell in October, the series Director\nand Writer, Sam Levinson, made it clear\nthat the new season was going to be a\n\u201cbrutal season\u201d for the teenage charac-ters, even more so than the last. So, it\ncame as no surprise when, lead actress,\nZendaya issued a message on Instagram\njustbeforethenewseasonaired,warning\nthat the show was created for \u201cmature\naudiences\u201d. Which, if we go by American TV Parental Guidelines, means that\nthe show is not suitable for viewers below 17 years old. Given that the show\nis quite forthright in its presentation of\nteenagers having sex, taking drugs, and\neverything else in between, I can see why\nit is not appropriate for younger viewers.\nSo, by process of elimination, this would\nmean that the show is therefore appropriate for adult viewers. This prompted\nme to ask myself another question: \u201cis\ntherenotsomethingslightlyweirdabout\nadults watching imaginary minors in\ntheir most intimate moments?\u201d\nGranted, I understand that every\nadult was once a teenager, and so we can\nall relate to the trials and tribulations\nexperienced through teenage years. Levinson himself was addicted to drugs in\nhis youth until he was 19 years old, and\nit was his retrospection into his teenage\nyears that also motivated him to write\nthe HBO series. In a 2019 Entertainment Weekly interview, he stated that\nhe wrote the series in an attempt to\n\u201ccapture that kind of heightened sense\nof emotion, when you\u2019re young and how\nrelationships feel. Relationships have\nsuch a pull and people have such a pull,\nand the world feels like it\u2019s just constantly sort of bearing down on you and that\nanxiety and those sort of mood swings\nthat I think are inherent to being young,\nin general then, but are even more so\nwhen you struggle with anxiety and depression and addiction.\u201d While I may\ndisagree with the execution of his vision,\nLevinson is right. Those formative teenage years are emotionally, physically, and\nmentally tumultuous, so I appreciate it\nwhen the struggles of youth are taken\nseriously in the media, instead of being\nswept aside.\nSo, yes, not every adult viewer has ne-fariousintentionsforwatchingtheshow.\nIt is understandable that some just like\nto watch the show for entertainment. Or\nto reminisce on their youth vicariously\nthrough teenage characters, and as wild\nand unfamiliar as the character\u2019s lifestyles may seem to some, there are undoubtedly people who can relate to their\nexperiences. I am not arguing for censorship of the often-harrowing experiences\nthat teenagers have; I am a prudent per-son. I believe that there is a lot of value\nin having open and serious discussions\nabout the realities faced in our teenage\nyears, media can sometimes facilitate\nthese discussions. I accept that there is\nnuance to this topic, and I understand\nthe arguments against mine, but I still\nthink that there is an issue here with the\nvoyeuristic way in which adults consume\nexplicit content about teenagers. I think\nthat the age of the actors plays a large\nrole in why adult viewers are not very\nhesitant to watch the show. These \u2018teenagers\u2019 look like adults because the actors\nare adults, and I am sure that plays a role\nin desensitising viewers to mature content depicting minors. Though, there is a\npragmatic reason behind casting adults.\nDue to US child labour laws, having\nan actor under the age of 18, a minor,\non a television series can be quite cost-ly. This is due to the restrictions on the\nhours they can work. I can only hope\nthat if such a law did not exist, and\nminors on-screen could be minors off-screen, people would see the glaring issue in teenagers being overtly sexualised\nin the media.\nOn social media, a suggestion that\nI have seen viewers propose is that the\nshow should have been made in a college setting, since that would be more\nage-appropriate, and college tends to be\nwhen most young people gain the freedom for more experiences. Of course,\nother viewers countered that point with\nthe fact that college is not a relatable\nsetting for all viewers, but high school\nis. Never mind how odd it was that\nthis insistence seemed to come mostly\nfrom viewers who were not minors, the\ncharacters in the show spend no visible\namount of time doing any schoolwork at\nall. The high school is simply a physical\nsetting at most, something that connects\ncharacters with little in common. And at\nbest, the high school setting provides a\nclear identifier of their youth, which is\nundoubtedly a source of nostalgia for\nadult viewers.\nUltimately, I have a problem with\nthe growing trend to portray fictional\nminors in explicit media, even more so\nwhen the content becomes so explicit\nthat it is marketed as something for mature audiences only. As adults we should\nbe highly aware of the fact that the representation of teen-hood in the media\nis not without consequence. My biggest concern is that shows that claim to\nopen dialogue about the growing pains\nof youth, simply desensitise viewers to\nthe point that we forget that teenagers\nin such extreme circumstances are vulnerable minors. As adults it is weird to\nindulge in media that softly romanticises\nthese experiences for entertainment.\nNot another teen series?\nHBO\u2019s Euphoria is back, and I will not be watching it this time.\nAnonymous\nFRIDAY 28TH JANUARY 2022\n32\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment Have an article in mind?\nEmail your idea or piece to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The album follows None,\nhis debut, released in the beginning of 2020. Hawk\nhas also worked with Fraxiom in\ntheir Food House project, which\nsparked from None\u2019s centrepiece,\nthe anthemic \u2018Thos Moser\u2019.\nYou\u2019re It was described by its\ncreator as \u201ca collection of tracks\n[he]\u2019s been hoarding for the past\ntwoyears\u201d,whichisquiteimportant\ninformation. The bubblegum\nbass sound of None is very much\nstill present, the drops are just as\nhard, and the songwriting, song\nnaming and track sequencing continue to be chaotic.\nOf course, Gupi\u2019s production has gone through logical\ntechnical improvement, with fresh ideas and new\nsounds \u2013 such as incredible blends of organic and\nsynthesisedinstrumentals,asseenin\u2018DanceWhileYou\nCan\u2019, a track that reinterprets the Electro House sound\nof the early 2010s. These \u201cpost-EDM\u201d reinventions\nare laid throughout the entire project, with the artist\nbringing sounds used in the past by Skrillex and\ndeadmau5 back to the table, and recycling them into a\nmodern, original songs. While this process may create\nexhilarating tunes, like \u2018Divinorum Spin\u2019, it sometimes\nfails, with the result being tracks like \u2018Body Horror\u2019 \u2013\nwhich falls into the old brostep idiosyncrasies, lacking\nconstructive songwriting and\naiming for repetitive drops. Indeed,\nsongwriting is Hawk\u2019s worst sin\nin You\u2019re It. He clearly displays\na talent for creating absorbing\nmelodies, but remains stubborn\nwhen writing each song, insisting\non flipping the same idea over and\nover \u2013 which can work sometimes,\nbut is set to exhaust the listener by\nthe end of the A-side.\nI was surprised by the lack of\nvocals, which brought life to songs like \u2018Modest\u2019 and\n\u2018Delusion\u2019 in his debut. While there are exceptions in\n\u2018Spiralcourse\u2019and\u2018Feel\u2019,thesingingisratherobnoxious,\ntaking a very abrasive tone, distancing itself from the\n\u201ccute\u201d aesthetic of None\u2019s vocals, as it boasts an excess\nof sped-up autotune, even for hyperpop standards.\n\u2018Spiralcourse\u2019 sounds like a Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s fan\nsong, and nothing will change my mind.\nAllinall,You\u2019reItissolid,evenifitismorepolarising\nthan its predecessor. In a way, the album\u2019s cover art is a\nperfect depiction of its music. Made by Hawk himself\non the default Mac app, Preview, the artwork is tacky\nand unconcise, but demonstrates creativity that is hard\nto come by. Undoubtedly, Gupi is still full of ideas, but\nhis songwriting needs to be revised. There is a lot of\npotential to be explored, and I am confident the third\nalbum will show it.\n\u201c\nGUPI IS STILL FULL\nOF IDEAS, BUT HIS\nSONGWRITING\nNEEDS TO BE\nREVISED\nSingle Review\nMom Jeans graduate from their new sound in \u2018Graduating Life\u2019\nWritten by Rosie Millns Music Editor\nHidden in every Mom Jeans record are some heart-wrenching gems. For their upcoming third album,\nSweet Tooth, released February 25th, that gem will be\nthe band\u2019s latest single \u2018Graduating Life\u2019.\nSweet Tooth is the band\u2019s first album in four years,\nsince the group released Puppy Love in 2018, and will\nbe the band\u2019s first fully-studio recorded album. Sweet\nTooth is produced by renowned emo-producer Brett\nRomnes, known for his work with Oso Oso, Sorority\nNoise, and The Front Bottoms, when they became\ngood again.\n\u2018Graduating Life\u2019 is the 4th single out from Sweet\nTooth, and honestly, the only one I have really liked.\nIt is the lightest single released so far, which is a\nwelcome contrast from its more pop-punk influenced\npredecessors that feel so far detached from Mom Jeans\u2019\ncharacteristic sound. \u2018Graduating Life\u2019 could easily fit\nin on Puppy Love or 2016\u2019s Best Buds, unlike the other\nnew tracks. For those who have listened to Mom Jeans\u2019\npast albums, the track is the \u2018now THIS is podracing\u2019\nof Sweet Tooth, or the retrospective cousin of \u2018Scott\nPilgrim Vs. My GPA\u2019.\nIn \u2018Graduating Life\u2019 the band have replaced their\nusual math-rock inspired guitar riffs with acoustic\nguitar strums, complemented beautifully by their\nsignature warm brass refrains in the second half of\nthe song. The short-and-sweet track is dripping with\nsentimentality, with anecdotal lyrics that provide the\nsong\u2019s retrospective mood.\nReminiscence for both the band\u2019s journey and life\nis a feeling intensified through the crowd-sung vocals\nin the latter part of the song (\u201cThis moment feels\nso nice / But you just can\u2019t wait to graduate life\u201d).\nThe music video also invites nostalgia, featuring old\nfootage of gigs, and childhood videos of the band. The\ntrack feels like a celebration of the band\u2019s history, and\nan acknowledgement to the fan support that got the\ngroup to where they are today.\nIdon\u2019thavehighhopesforSweetTooth.Therelatable\nanddepressinglyricsofpastalbumsaregone,alongside\nthe intricate drum rhythms, math-rock inspired riffs,\nand unpolished DIY sounds that I loved this band for.\nEven their witty and unrelated song titles (\u2018jon bong\njovi\u2019, \u2018you can\u2019t eat cats kevin\u2019) are gone. But if, like me,\nyou are a fan of Mom Jeans who has been disappointed\nby their recent tracks, \u2018Graduating Life\u2019 proves that the\nband are still worth a chance.\nI am not filled with enough teenage angst to enjoy\nany new Mom Jeans release as much as I did 2016\u2019s\nBest Buds, but more nostalgic songs from the group\ndefinitely have the potential to send me down the\nrabbit-holeofexclusivelylisteningtoMomJeansagain.\nGupi\u2019s latest project is a controversial compilation of half-baked, but refreshing ideas\nEmo band Mom Jeans release a refreshingly nostalgic track as their 4th single from their upcoming album\nAlbum Review\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 28TH JANUARY 2022\n31\nFood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nwith some lemon juice, the flavours of the chicken were\neven more heightened and brought into the spotlight.\nThe Miso Wafu also has Chicken Karaage served as a\ntopping, for those who want a little more of crispy fried\nchicken!\nThe White Natural, a vegetarian ramen, consisted of\na broth made from kombu seaweed and shiitake mush-rooms, and it was a very warming and soothing broth.\nThe heat from the broth was much needed on a cold\nday, and the spice added an extra kick. The broth was\ncomplemented with atsuage fried tofu, kikurage mush-rooms,menmabambooshootsandnoriseaweedonthe\nside. It also included a very generous serving of ramen\nnoodles. The atsuage fried tofu wasn\u2019t anything special,\nit tasted like a standard tofu but it did add some nice\ntexture which I appreciated as I do like a good tofu.\nThe sides were firm and slightly crisp but the inside was\nsofter but not too soft that it crumbled in the ramen\nbroth. Menma bamboo shoots had a very interesting\ntaste, and although I\u2019m not a fan of the standalone\nstrong bamboo taste or the rubbery texture, I would be\nlying if I didn\u2019t acknowledge the flavour it added to the\nbroth without overpowering the other ingredients or\nhaving its taste rub onto the ramen itself. Overall it was\nhighly enjoyable, extremely satisfying and for the price\nyou pay, the volume of ramen you get is a great deal.\nThe Miso Wafu Chicken was delicious and flavour-ful, containing a lot of umami in its broth which is\nmade from a unique tonyu soy milk, white miso, shiitake mushroom and kombu soy combination. The ramen is then topped off with the previously mentioned\njuicy and crispy chicken karaage, kikurage mushrooms,\nspring onions, red ginger and nori seaweed. Each topping in the ramen was delicious and provided its own\nflavour and texture to the dish. Besides the Chicken Karaage (see above, it was juicy and crunchy), the\nmushrooms were nice and firm, adding another subtle\nlayer of umami to the dish and brought a different texture to the bowl. The ginger once again provided a nice\nzesty flavour cutting through the built up rich flavour\nof umami in your mouth and the spring onion provided\nwas subtly placed in the bowl, but had a nice touch of\nsweetness and zing - bringing the whole dish together.\nThe noodles were once again plentiful and at the right\nfirmness doing a good job in holding and absorbing the\nbroth it was resting in and did not get soggy over time.\nThe Miso Tonkotsu Ramen is a seasonal exclusive,\nmade with a rich broth of miso and pork soup and garnished with soy marinated braised kakuni pork belly,\npak choi, nitamago egg, kikurage mushrooms, spring\nonion, red ginger and nori seaweed. The pork was nice\nand soft in texture and tasty and rich in flavour but I\nfound it to be a little bit over marinated for my taste\nbuds - which is just a preference. The noodles were also\nthe same as the other two ramen, the right firmness and\ngood at holding the broth. I found the egg to be timely cooked, providing a subtle gooey softness at its core,\nadding a nice level of umami into the broth when spilt\nover. The other garnishes were also well matched with\nthis style of ramen providing different textures and flavours in each bite, keeping you at your toes and stopping you from getting bored of the broth.\nDessert was a must, especially after a nice fla-vour-packed and a good value for money ramen dish.\nThe heat from the ramen broths and the sides of\nTakoyaki and crispy Chicken Karaage, served with Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise called for a cool and sweet\nending.\nAll in all, their dessert selection isn\u2019t the widest,\nwhich is understandable as dessert isn\u2019t Shoryu\u2019s spe-ciality. However, we got our hands on some matcha\ncheesecake,mochiice-cream(chocolatecookie-dough)\nand a standard ice-cream with two scoops of chocolate\nand matcha flavour.\nFirst let\u2019s talk about the Matcha Cheesecake (\u00a35.90),\nalthough I\u2019m personally not the biggest fan of matcha,\nI still wanted to try it out as I\u2019m an avid cheesecake\nlover. The size you get for the price you pay is a little\ndisappointing. The cheesecake consisted of a very generous amount of matcha filling on top and the crust at\nthe bottom seemed quite stiff and wasn\u2019t much. Regardless, the flavours of the matcha were still present -which I\u2019m sure a matcha lover would appreciate. I also\nfound the filling to be very airy and light, so depending\non how you like your cheesecake, this is either good or\nbad. Personally I think this would\u2019ve gone well with\nsome tea, which Shoryu served as either hot or iced -which I didn\u2019t buy.\nSecondly we had Mochi Ice-cream (\u00a35.50), which\nreminded me of the \u2018Little Moons\u2019 craze last year. I\nwouldn\u2019t say there is much of a difference between\nthe two, For the flavour, we picked Cookie-Dough.\nThe glutinous rice of the mochi thinly coats the cook-ie-dough ice-cream, providing a nice chewy texture of\na traditional mochi. The chocolatey goodness was definitely mouth-soothing, and the cookie-dough flavour\nwas very apparent as well. I\u2019d definitely recommend\nthis if you buy something extremely spicy, as it was definitely a mouth cooler! Finally, the Ice Cream (\u00a34.60)\nwas nice and standard, not too sweet and the flavours\nwere clear and apparent, go for this if you want to go\nfor something safe and reliable.\nTo summarise the overall experience at Shoryu, I\nwould definitely say the price you pay for the meal and\nservice is worth it. They have deals like \u2018Bun Monday\u2019, a\nbuy-1-get-1-free deal, when you buy any ramen or cur-ry, and \u2018Takoyaki Tuesday\u2019 which is the 8pc Takoyaki\nat half price with any ramen or curry. A 10% student\ndiscount is also available here, so make sure you keep\nthat in mind when going, along with an empty stomach as the food is quite filling!\nPhoto credits: Melis Efecan\nThe White Natural - The Vegetarian Ramen\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nMiso Wafu Chicken Ramen\nPhoto credits: Jerry Zheng\nMiso Tonkotsu Ramen\nMacha Cheesecake\nPhoto credits: Melis Efecan\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nCookie -Dough Mochi Ice Cream\nFOOD\n\n"

The\ncommissioner accepted that the release\nof some of the information contained\nin the report would contravene data\nprotection principles, but ordered the\nCollege to release the majority of the\nreport,withthosespecificpartsredacted.\nThe report from the Information\nCommissioner also stated that the\nCollege had failed to issue a refusal\nnotice within the allocated time\nframe of 20 working days when\nthe request was initially received,\nand had therefore further breached\nthe Freedom of Information Act.\nAgainstdisclosure,theCollegeargued\nthat the report contained information\nabout Gast\u2019s and Sanderson\u2019s personal\nlives, though the Commissioner\ndid not agree with this argument.\nThe College also argued that\nthe report contained many details\nabout the personal lives of those who\nwere interviewed and the original\nwhistleblower(s).TheCollegearguedon\ntop of this that during the investigation\nthere had been multiple assurances from\nthe investigating QC and the College\u2019s\ninternal policy that the proceedings\nin the investigation would be kept\nconfidential. The Commissioner agreed\nwith the first statement, highlighting\nthat in some cases \u2018special category\ndata\u2019 relating to the witnesses had been\nincluded. Special category data includes\nthat pertaining to someone\u2019s race, sexual\norientation and health, as well as other\ndata. However, having reviewed the\nreport, the commissioner concluded\nthat aspects of discourse during the\ninvestigation suggested that the findings\nmaybeshared\u201cincertaincircumstances\u201d\nand that the witnesses\u2019 fears were\nmore surrounding internal backlash,\nas opposed to a reveal to the public.\nIn fact, the commissioner considered\nthat a public disclosure would provide\nmore protection to witnesses rather\nthan less, as any internal backlash\nwould be more intensely scrutinised.\nDespite this, the commissioner\ndecided that prior expectation of\nsuch an investigation to remain\nconfidential outweighed any legitimate\ninterest for disclosure, and therefore\ndecided that no information that\ncould lead to the identification of\nany witnesses could be published.\nDuring the investigation, Gast wrote\na letter containing \u201cstrong objections\nto the disclosure of her personal data\u201d\nto the Commissioner. In this letter, she\nreiterated that further disclosure would\n\u201cnot add any insight\u201d into proceedings.\nShe also added that \u201cfemale leaders\naccused of bullying were treated less\ngenerously than male leaders\u201d and drew\nparallels between her case and that\nof Kathleen Stock, an ex-professor of\nPhilosophy at the University of Sussex\nwho resigned near the end of 2021 due\nto continued pressure from students\nwho opposed her views on transgender\npeople. The Daily Mail described this\ncomparison as \u201cbizzare\u201d, and noted\nthat Stock had not been accused of\nbullying nor had her conduct probed.\nShe added that the report included\n\u201c\u2019few, relatively minor, findings against\n[her]\u2019 and that she had \u2018serious concerns\u2019\nabouttheaccuracyofsomeofthereport\u201d.\nGastsaidthattheinformationthathas\nalready been made public has led to her\nFRIDAY 28TH JANUARY 2022\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nImperial College ordered to release\nredacted version of bullying report\nNEWS\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\nThe College opposed the\npublication of the report based\non two clauses of the Freedom of\nInformation Act. One of these,\nsection 36, requires a \u2018qualified\nperson\u2019 to deem that publication of\nthe information in question is likely\nto \u2018prejudice the effective conduct of\npublic affairs\u2019. Though it sounds fairly\nvague, the definition of a qualified\nperson is very strictly laid out in the\nAct, and changes depending on the\npublic body in question. In the case\nof Imperial College, the qualified\nperson, by law, has to be Alice Gast\nThis has led to, on two occassions,\nGast confirming via email that she\nis happy for an exemption to be\nexercised that blocks the dispersal of\ninformation surrounding her own,\nbullying, conduct.\nAnd, get this, the reasoning of\nthis \u201cqualified person\u201d is given in\nthe decision report by the ICO. This\nreasoning is as follows: \u201cDisclosure\nwould inhibit employees of public\nauthorities from fully co-operating\nand contributing to whistleblowing\ninvestigations. If interviewees felt\nthat what they said was liable to be\npublished, even on a non-attributable\nbasis, they would be far less likely\nto be forthright. This would make\nsuch inquiries more difficult to carry\nout and would undermine their\neffectiveness\u201d.\nSo, Alice Gast\u2019s reasoning against\nthe publication of the investigation\nreport is that doing so would\nundermine the confidence of\nwhistleblowers in making allegations,\nand of witnesses when giving\ntestimony. Defending the integrity\nof the very process that has found\nher guilty of bullying subordinates,\nin order to prevent the further\ndissemination of details of how she\nbullied her subordinates. You cannot\nmake this up.\nIt is worth noting that Gast was\nadvised by independent individuals\nin making this reasoning, however,\naccording to the Commissioner, these\nindividuals had not seen the report.\nFunny Old Law\nCredit: Imperial College London\n\n"

The entire show takes place in one location\n\u2014 a grand room of their fictional Haversham Manor,\ncomplete with fireplace and accompanying cutlasses.\nWhilst the set design is static, there are multiple levels for the cast to explore: with a study set on a second floor above a library.

The diverse methods on\ndisplay range from applications of hard\nengineering to nature-based solutions.\nA direct air capture machine takes\ncentre-stage in the exhibition hall. This\ntechnology was developed by the Swiss\ncompany, Climeworks. Each unit can\nremove 50 tonnes of carbon dioxide\nfrom the air annually. Companies and\nindividuals can employ Climeworks to\nremove carbon dioxide on their behalf,\nenabling others to take ownership\nof their carbon dioxide emissions.\nAmbient air enters the unit through\na collector, following which carbon\ndioxide is removed through a filter. After\nthe carbon dioxide is stored within the\nmachine, the residual air is discharged\nfrom the unit. The stored carbon\ndioxide can then be used for commercial\npurposes such as manufacturing\nbracelets or carbonating fizzy drinks.\nEngineering solutions were also\npresented such that they mimic the\nnatural process in trees. Professor Klaus\nLackner from Arizona State University\ndesigned a mechanical tree to capture\ncarbon dioxide. The leaves of the tree\nare coated with carbonate-containing\nresin which combine with carbon\ndioxide to form bicarbonate. As the\nleaves move towards the base of the\ntree, they get wetted. Consequently, the\nbicarbonate reverts back to a carbonate\nform, releasing carbon dioxide into a\nstorage chamber. When the lid of the\nbase is opened, the leaves get air-dried\nbefore the carbon capture process is\nrepeated. A prototype of the mechanical\ntree towers over all the other exhibits.\nThepressingneedforamassivestorage\nspace becomes evident after the carbon\ndioxide is captured. The UK is in a\ngood position to employ carbon capture\ntechnology due to its close proximity to\nthe emptying oil fields at the Northern\nSea and Irish Sea. The Northern\nEndurance Partnership facilitates\noffshore transportation to sequester\nthe UK\u2019s captured carbon at sea.\nTo circumvent the requirement\nfor storage, nature-based solutions\ncan be employed to organically store\ncarbon dioxide. The Carbfix project,\noriginating from Iceland, offers a\nnatural storage method by combining\ncarbon dioxide with underground\nstone. Carbon dioxide is dissolved in\nwater and then injected into reactive\nrocks which are rich in metals. These\nrocks function as a permanent store for\ncarbon dioxide as the carbonates formed\nin this process are chemically stable.\nTo minimise the embodied carbon\nused in construction materials, civil\nengineers are starting to prefer the use of\nwood over concrete and steel. A model\nof a building with wooden frames and\nflooring is displayed in the hall. Such\na building is set to be constructed at\nGoldsmiths, University of London\nwith sustainably sourced timber.\nEchoing the recently renewed\ncall for tree planting, the exhibition\nhighlights some forest management\nstrategies. Good upkeep of trees in\na forest will allow for their carbon-capturing power to be maximised. A\nsoil respiration apparatus developed\nby the University of Birmingham is\ndisplayed at the exhibition. This device\ncan be used to measure the carbon\ndioxide released by soil, roots and fungi\nin a woodland ecosystem. A falling\nbranch during a tornado resulted\nin the dent seen on the apparatus.\nThe enthusiasm of the developers of\nthese innovations was evident in the\nvideopresentationsdisplayedaroundthe\nexhibits.Thenextstepwillbetotransform\nthese laboratory-based innovations into\nmechanisms that work on a large scale.\nOur endeavour to reduce the amount\nof carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\nwill also benefit from global policy\nand political will. The free exhibition\nwill run till September 2022. Visit the\nWellcome Wing, Level 0, at the Science\nMuseum to learn how carbon capture\nsystems can rescue our future planet.\nRachel Rajan George Environment Writer\n\n"

    "content": "Colombia is considered one\nof the world\u2019s most diverse\ncountries, making up 10% of the\nplanet\u2019s biodiversity. Surprisingly,\nthe most publicised species living in\nthe country is not Colombian. This\nis a tale about a foreign species: the\nhippopotamus. Hippos live natively in\nsub-Saharan Africa where they spend\nmost of the time in water. So how did\nthese hippos end up in Colombia?\nBack in 1981, drug lord Pablo\nEscobar imported three females and\none male hippo, amongst other exotic\nanimals, from a zoo in the USA to his\nranch named Hacienda N\u00e1poles. This\n20 square-kilometre ranch is located\nclose to the Magdalena River, which is\nthe main river of Colombia, travelling\nover 1.528 kilometres. In 1993, Pablo\nEscobar died and with him his exotic\nzoo\u2014most animals were distributed to\nother preservation sites. An exception\nwere the hippos, who were left in their\ncomfortable pond, mainly due to\ntransportation difficulties as well as\nthe lack of awareness at the time of any\nrisk of leaving the hippos behind. By\n2006, when the ranch was remodelled\nas a touristic park, the initial hippos\nhad reproduced into approximately\n16 individuals, wandering through the\npremises and proximate ponds. More\nrecently, these hippo offspring have\nbeen sighted 100 kilometres up the river.\nCurrently, there is no census data\navailable for the hippo population in\nColombia, but models are predicting\nover 5,000 individuals by 2050. This\nrapid increase in population reflects\nthe gravity of invasive species. These\nhippos don\u2019t have natural predators\nin the country, are enjoying wetlands\nareas that last the whole year (in Africa\nthe dry season diminishes their living\nconditions), and find enough food from\nthe biodiverse area. It has even been\nfound that they are maturing faster than\ntheir fellow African individuals, due\nto their excellent growing conditions.\nIn 2009 some hippos started living\ncloser to villages, affecting crops\nand cattle. Given this situation the\ngovernment and hunting specialists\nkilled one male hippo named Pepe.\nPictures of the deceased Pepe were seen\nwith outrage in the world. So much so\nthat a US federal judge granted the\ndescription of \u201cinterested persons\u201d to\nthese hippos, becoming the first time\nthat the American judicial system has\nrecognised the legal personhood of a\nnonhuman. After culling was banned\nin Colombia, the new measure from\nthe government has been to sterilise\nthe individuals. Unfortunately, this\nprocess requires complex logistics and\nis slow and costly. In addition, experts\nhave announced that this measure will\nonly be successful if a high proportion\nof males are castrated rapidly.\nStill, the problem becomes bigger\nwith time. The consequences of\nthis charismatic species range from\nendangering native species, such as\nmanatees, to causing changes in the\nriver. For example, an increase in\nalgae and oxygen depletion have been\nattributed to the hippos\u2019 faeces. Also,\nit has created a divide between locals\u2014\nthose that have found in hippos the\nperfect touristic attraction and others\naffected by hippos destroying their\nlivelihoods or threatening their lives.\nA political debate has arisen with\nopposing views on what the future of\nthe hippos in Colombia should be. A\ncandidate for this year\u2019s elections has\nsuggested building a sanctuary for the\nanimals, based on the moral standard\nthat the hippos have a right to live.\nOn the other hand, this idea has been\ncriticised given its costs and lack of\ncoherence for preserving hippos over\nColombian native endangered species.\nIn this sense, some have suggested\nthat it is time to acknowledge this\ncharismatic species as an invasive and\ndangerous one for the country, and to\nnot discard culling as a possible way out.\nThe solutions are far from ready,\nespecially in the public scene where\nColombia has adopted hippos as an\nunofficial mascot. This issue needs\nto be prioritised immediately by the\ngovernment, gathering experts, locals,\nand scientists, amongst others, to discuss\nthe current situation and the need to\nwork fast and forward to avoid damages\nandfurtherexpansionofthisspeciesthat\ndoesn\u2019t belong, however attractive it is.\nHippos in Colombia: The\ntale of a charismatic invasion\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMonika Yordanova\nMarie Mori\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment View online here!\nCarolina Piamonte Environment Writer\n14\nIllustrationbyNatalieYu\nNB\nWith this article I want to expand\non an issue analysed by the students\nof the MSc of Environmental\nTechnology last term regarding\nthe hunting of charismatic species\nand the debates it imposes.

    "content": "What really is Cleantech investing?\nA bubble is forming...\nA bubble refers to a situation when prices of a good/service/stock is higher than it could be reasonably justified.\nThese are generally caused when the confidence in the future performance of good/service/stock is exceptionally high.\nWhen the bubble bursts the value of the good/service/stock reduces back to what it should have been. For instance, Gamestop stock experienced a bubble.\nA \u201cBUBBLE\u201d... TELL ME MORE \u2013 I\u2019M A BIT CONFUSED!\nNitya Agarwal\nWriter\nHow clean really is the technology that\u2019s been getting fast\npraise in the green era of investing?\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n28 Investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Ahmad Danesh\nInvestment Investment Society\nImperial College London\nCleantech,orcleantechnology,means\nusing technology to find solutions\nfor a reduction in negative environmental changes. It focuses on shifting production processes\nand the use of goods and services that are harmful for\nthe environment into environment-friendly processes.\nThe importance of climate and the idea to work towards conserving and saving it is not new. The clean-tech trend has been in the market since the early 2000s,\nbut was substantially reduced when the cleantech bubble burst after 2009. Nevertheless, as the climate conditions worsen, the value of clean tech has increased\nagain, but this time it has increased across all sectors\nand with better technology and policies.\nThe cleantech trend during 2006-2011 was ahead\nof its time. Nevertheless, the trend was strong and\nencouraged a lot of investments in the start-up industry.\nMost of the investments made in the start-ups during\nthis period were in capital intensive start-ups, e.g.\nSolyndra (solar energy company) and so on, which\nwere long period investments with large timelines for\ntechnology development and slower returns. However,\nwith the bubble burst, so did the investments. The VC\nfirms lost more than half of their investments and many\nstart-ups were unable to pay back the money invested.\nThere are two main groups of factors that led to this\ndownfall. Firsty, the factors that directly affected the\ncleantech industry: The high price of renewable energy,\ninadequate technology, lack of urgency i.e., people\u2019s\nbelief that the effects of climate changes will affect the\nfuture generations to come, but not substantially the\npresent. Second, factors that indirectly affected the\ncleantech industry: the great recession. The financial\ncrisis in 2007-2008, led to the shortage of cash flow,\nfalling real estate market, high unemployment,\ndecrease in the confidence of investors in the market.\nUnderstandably, surviving in such a period would have\nbeen a challenge.\nHowever, the recent and persistent climate change\neffects have caught the attention of everyone. The\nforest fires in California, floods in Germany and\nheatwaves in Europe and Canada all within a couple of\nyears have emphasised the severity of climate change.\nThis allowed for the re-emergence of the cleantech\ntrend. However, this time the \u2018cleantech revolution\u2019\nis more mature as compared to its previous version\nand also covers a wider spectrum of sectors. In the\nearly 2000s the main investments in cleantech were\nin solar and wind energy. This has now expanded to\nhydrogen and Electric vehicles with a major focus on\ndecarbonisation. In the recent United Nations climate\nchange conference(COP26), there was an emphasis\non reducing emissions from agricultural production as\nwell rather than just industries and transportation. This\nshows a serious climate change consideration from all\nthe sectors rather than just the basic ones.\nAdditionally,therehasbeenasubstantialincreasein\ntechnological advancement which has allowed a great\nreduction in the prices of renewable energy, allowing\nthem to compete with prices of fossil fuels. Due to\ntechnological advancement in solar energy, the price\nhas decreased from $359Mwh in 2009 to $40Mwh in\n2019 i.e. 89% reduction due to development of solar\nphotovoltaics. Similarly, due to the development of\nonshore wind the price of wind energy has reduced\nfrom $135 Mwh (2009) to $41MWh (2019), a 70%\nreduction.\nThe development in this industry is complemented\nby various government policies such as the USConsolidated Appropriations Act and Notice 2021-05 from the Treasury, which includes the extension of\ntax credits for solar investment and wind production;\nUSA\u2019s intention of spending $2 trillion in EV\ndevelopment and establishing charging stations;the\nlaunch of \u2018hydrogen strategy\u2019 by the UK, which aims\nat using hydrogen for 20-35% of energy generation by\n2050; China and Japan also aim to achieve net-zero\ncarbon emission by 2060 and 2050 respectively. Also,\nCanada\u2019s 2021 budget emphasizes carbon reduction\nby introducing investment tax credit for investments\nin carbon capture, utilization and storage projects to\nreduce more than 15 megatons of CO2 annually. There\nis a surge in policies of climate change in different\nnations all over the world indicating the emergence\nof a global market for cleantech. This global cleantech\nsector is expected to be worth more than $2.5 trillion\nby the end of 2022.\nAlongwiththis,duetotheincreaseinnegativeeffects\nof climate change, many companies have established\nESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)\ndepartments that analyse the sustainability of the\ninvestments, the impact of a decision on society and so\non.\nThe evolution and progress in the industry has\nincreased the investor\u2019s confidence considerably. This\nincrease is depicted in the performance of the stocks\nof this industry in the market. The stocks started to\ngain traction again by the end of 2018 and eventually\noutperformed the already bullish market during\nCOVID-19. For instance, the Deloitte Australian\nCleantech index rose by 33.9% in 2020. The Venture\ncapitalists have also started to invest strongly in start-ups as the funding increased from $1.5 billion in 2020\nto nearly $6 billion in 2021.\nThe rapid attention and popularity in the cleantech\nmarket has led to a considerable increase in stock prices\nand funding.

Animation technology has come a long\nway since my first watch of Aladdin on VCR in 2004,\nand it shows in this masterpiece.\nThe main character, Mirabel Madrigal (voiced by\nStephanie Beatriz), is the second youngest grandchild\nin a family blessed with a MiracleTM\n. The Miracle has\nhistorically provided a safe haven from looters and\nblessed all members of the family with various powers\nthat are used to help the rest of the town. All members\nof the family except Mirabel, of course - for how would\nwegetinvestedinaclassicfairytaleifthemaincharacter\ndidn\u2019t have a tragic backstory?\nThe backstory is well developed, explaining quite\nearly on how the isolated town came to be, and\neverything else is attributed to the Miracle. However,\nthe plot is in so much disarray that viewers are left with\nmore questions than answers as the movie progresses.\nScenes shift between each other without care for\ncontinuity of the narrative.\nThere are certainly tear-jerking scenes, but despite\nterrific buildup, an abrupt change in scene to a \"happy\"\none ruins more than a few moments.\nWhile the pretty scenes of the far-off mountains\ndistinctively remind you of Lilo and Stitch, there\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be any sort of moral parable other than\n\u201cfamily sticks together\u201d, which Lilo and Stitch have\nalready covered quite well - or, as might well be the\ncase,therearetoomanymorallessonsthatcanbetaken\nfrom each scene that it confuses the message.\nThere were too many characters attempting to play\nthe role of protagonist, with an especial focus on their\npowers - perhaps to further highlight that the other\nmembers of Mirabel\u2019s family had made their powers\ntheir personality over their ties to each other.\nWith songs written by Broadway Musical Hamilton\ncreator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, I was expecting a bit\nmore than eight songs squashed in together - some\nbeing absolute bops, and others being even less\nmemorable than the three random children who\ncontributed nothing but vague commentary after the\nfirst song \u201cMeet the Madrigals\u201d.\nNow, \u201cMeet the Madrigals\u201d is somewhat bouncy to\nlisten to, but the star of the entire movie is \u201cWe Don\u2019t\nTalk About Bruno\u201d. If you haven\u2019t yet heard of it, you\nwerebusywithJanuaryexams.Istillpromiseitisworth\na listen. Bruno (Mirabel\u2019s maternal uncle) is the black\nsheep of the family - seer of the future, he was asked\nto investigate the future of the Miracle and family\nMadrigal after Mirabel failed to obtain power when\nshe came of age. He has not been seen since that fateful\nnight.\nBack to \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about Bruno\u201d, the characters\ntalk about Bruno - did you expect any less? Without\nrevealing too many details, the visual and musical\naspects of this song blend in so well together that I\nwould not be surprised if it ended up winning a prize.\nMusicalityaside,themovienonethelessleavesabitter\naftertaste, as too much is very abruptly revealed in the\nlast twenty minutes of the movie through flashbacks\nand vague reassurances that \u201cthe Miracle is you.\u201d\nNot to fret, there are still comedic moments - the\nguy who makes the spackle puts a pail on his head to\nprotect it as he headbutts the walls of a crumbling\nhouse, an aspiring novella director with wayward\nactors, and of course, the capybara who does not care\nabout your 'special' circle of sand.\nThismovieisafeatfortheeyesandears,butcertainly\nnotforthebrain-Iwouldrecommendwatchingitafter\ngrueling coursework, or at a point where your brain\nis comfortable with nothing of the storyline making\nsense.\nTelevision\nHawkeye Takes a Bow\nFollowing on from the review in Issue 1786, \u2018Hawkeye\u2019 has delivered in true Marvel fashion, with\ntwists leading to a satisfying conclusion. Barton and\nBishop make every effort to impress in their battle\nagainst the Tracksuit Mafia, with a bigger baddie appearing on the scene as Maya Lopez starts to gain our\nsympathy.\nNative American actress Alaqua Cox portrays deaf\ncharacterMaya,takingthebatonfromLaurenRidloffas\nMakkariin\u2018Eternals\u2019.BothCoxandRidloffareactually\ndeaf, making their long overdue representation in the\nMCU all the more significant. Lopez has a poignant\nbackstory; a past riddled with crime and the death of\nher father weighing on her shoulders. Her eventual\nliberation from the clutches of the mafia sets the scene\nfor a future Marvel TV series in which she becomes the\nsuperhero \u2018Echo\u2019. The main villain of the series reveals\nhimself to be a crime lord named Wilson Fisk, with the\nalias \u2018Kingpin\u2019, a huge specimen of a man with ties to\nDaredevil. Kate finally appears to have met her match\nin Kingpin, and their confrontation arguably allows\nher to cement her place in the new line-up of heroes.\nWe are also graced with the presence of the highly\nanticipated Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova. Yelena\nmaintains a comedic comradely banter with Kate\nthroughout each of their interactions, reminiscent\nof jesting with her sister, leading to a gut-wrenching\nexchange with Barton. Episode 5 also affords us a\npoignant glimpse into her experiences following the\nblip, which makes Natasha\u2019s spiritual presence even\nstronger, with the show becoming a second tribute to\nthe fallen Avenger. As always, Pugh leaves us wanting\nto see more of Yelena, and she is sure to continue as a\nprominent feature in the MCU.\nHawkeye and Bishop manage to amass a team of\namiable and accommodating, albeit na\u00efve, Medieval\n\u2018LARPer\u2019. They come along for the ride, helping where\nthey can, but are relegated to the sidelines; there to\nservice Hawkeye\u2019s needs. There are hints that they may\ndevelop into characters that are more fleshed out, but\nfor now they remain loyal sidekicks.\nMarvel opted for Hawkeye\u2019s story to be a TV show\nin lieu of a film due to the complexity of the story\nthey wanted to tell, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Eleanor\nBishop herself turns out to be less innocent than she\nappears, and Laura Barton\u2019s character is given a new\nspark with intriguing connections to S.H.I.E.L.D.\nand a potential explanation for how she met Clint \u2013\nsomething that could be explored in a second season?\n\u2018Lucky\u2019 the golden retriever remains more a symbol of\ncompanionship and comfort than an active part of the\nteam, although he will surely be at Kate\u2019s heel in future\nshenanigans.\nWhile many bits and pieces of the show are\nsuggestive of the earlier films \u2013 Rogers: The Musical\nand the Avengers memorial being notable examples \u2013 a\nparticularly interesting scene is that of the two archers\nassembling their multitudes of trick arrows, that recalls\nscenes of Tony Stark tinkering with his suits and tech\nin the Ironman movies. The series gives us an insight\nintoBarton\u2019spreparationforbattlesthatwedidn\u2019ttend\nto see earlier on.\nOur beloved Barton and Bishop have yet to have\nfutureappearancesconfirmed,althoughwearehopeful\nthey will be back on the big screen.\nDirectedby: Jared Bush, Byron Howard\nStarring: Stephanie Beatriz, John Leguizamo, ...\nFRIDAY 28TH JANUARY 2022\n\n"

But the growth halts at the\nadult stage. Then, the period of ageing\n(or senescence) begins, and organisms\nundergo a gradual deterioration of tissues that result in age-related diseases,\ninfertility and finally, death.\nHowever, lobsters can grow indefinitely throughout their lives whilst\nmaintaining juvenile vigour and reproducing until their death. The reason for\nthis unique phenomenon is that lobsters\nhave infinite supplies of telomerase, an\nenzymethatregeneratestelomeres.These\narefragmentsofDNAlocatedattheend\nof eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres\nprotect the integrity of the chromo-some. However, the length of telomeres\nshortens with each cell division. When\nthe chromosomes run out of telomere,\nthe cell has a very high risk of suffering\nDNA damages during cell division and\nhence, are more likely to convert into a\nmalignant (or cancerous) cell. Therefore,\nfor the sake of the whole body, the cell\nstops undergoing division and enters a\nperiod of cellular senescence. However,\nthis means that the cells of tissue will not\nbe replaced by new ones. Consequently,\nthe fate of the organism is a continuous and systemic organic deterioration.\nTelomerase avoids this cruel destiny by\nelongating the telomeres again and allowing cells to undergo more cell divi-sions, rejuvenating the tissues. Lobsters\nhave the gene that encodes for telomer-ase activated in every single cell of their\nbody, but in the case of mammals, tel-omerase only works in the whole body\nduring embryonic development and it\nthenshutsdown,exceptintheparticular\ncells called stem cells. However, lobsters\narefarfrombeingimmortals,anddonot\nusually live more than 40 years. This is\nbecause, like any other arthropod, they\nneed to moult their shells as they grow.\nShedding is a biologically stressful process and it only gets harder the larger the\nlobsteris.Around10-15%oflobstersdie\nduring shedding due to exhaustion. This\npercentage is small because the most\ncommon causes of death in lobsters are\ndiseases and predation.\nIf there is any creature on Earth that\ncould be truly qualified as \u201cimmortal\u201d, it\nisthejellyfishTurritopsisdohrnii.Thejel-lyfish begins life as a polyp, a small tube-like structure attached to the ocean floor\nthan eventually decided into a colony of\nspecialised cells that can reproduce to\nform new polyps. The signature trait of\nT. dohrnii is the capability to \u201crestart its\nlife cycle. That is to say, T. dohrnii is able\nto \u2018mock\u2019 death by transforming itself\ninto a cyst (a mass of tissue) and from\nthis back again to its polyp stage, resetting its life cycle. If humans had this abil-ity, we would be able to become babies\nagain and grow normally to adulthood.\nSince the discovery of its \u2018immortality\u2019\nin the 1980s, several studies have been\nconducted to find out the mechanisms\nbehind it. Some of the most impressive\nresearch was carried out by the Japanese\nprofessor, Shin Kubota, who has kept\nthis species in captivity for over 10\nyears. In 2020, an\ninvestigation into\nthe genetic material of T. dohrnii revealed high activity\nof genes that express\ntelomerase in the\ncyst form, similar to\nlobster. Therefore,\ntelomerase is a key\nplayer in repairing\njellyfish DNA in its\ncyst stage so it may\ncarry out its life cycle once again.\nHumans cannot\nwithstand more\nthan three days\nwithout drinking\nwater. A dehydration of around \u00bc\nof our body mass is\ndeadly. Astonishingly, the resurrecting plant Xerophyta\nviscosa can survive having lost 95% of its\nwater content! This plant lives in regions\nof South Africa where there are periods\nofwaterscarcity.WhenX.viscosadetects\nthat available water levels are plunging,\nit starts shutting down almost all its operating systems. X. viscosa can halt photosynthesis by degrading chlorophyll,\na photosynthetic pigment that absorbs\nsunlight. Consequently, X. viscosa shuts\ndown its metabolism and enters a standby state that would be lethal for most\nliving beings. When the environmental\nhumidity begins rising to optimal levels,\nthe plant reacts quickly and can return\nto its normal metabolic activity in three\ndays as if nothing happened!\nOverall, there is a pattern in these\norganisms. First, they are able to modify greatly the DNA composition and\nstructure in such a radical way that\nmammals, including us, cannot. Second, they possess the capability to enter\ninto a dormant-regenerative phase (e.g.,\ncyst form in the case of T. dohrnii). This\nwould be deadly in human cells as they\nneed to be in constant activity to continue living. Therefore, the \u201ceternal fountain of youth\u201d is still far away, if it even\nexists.\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nTurritopsis rubra, a jellyfish very closely related to T. dohrnii.

    "content": "Human T-lymphotropic virus\n(HTLV-1) is a virus which mainly\ninfects T cells, a type of white blood cell\nthatmakesupanessentialpartofourim-mune system, and induces chronic and\nlifelong infection. This virus spreads in\nthe same way as HIV, via blood, sharing\nneedles, sexual contact and breastfeed-ing. In the majority of people it causes\nno symptoms, however, in some infected individuals, infection with HTLV-1\ncan lead to the development of cancer.\nAn estimated 5-10 million people are\ninfected with HTLV-1 worldwide, for\nwhich there is currently no treatment or\ncure.\nNow, an international team made\nup of scientists from Imperial College\nLondon and the Kumamoto University\nin Japan, have shown that the HTLV-1\nis able to cause a rare type of leukemia,\nknown as adult T-cell leukemia/lym-phoma (ATL).\nHow does HTLV-1 cause leu-kemia?\nThe team\u2019s research was recently published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, and showed that HTLV infects\nT cells, where it inserts a copy of itself\ninto human DNA in a process known\nas integration. After integration, the virus remains\nlatent, meaning it does\nnot multiply\nwithin the\nhost cells or\nproduce any\nviral particles.\nDue to this,\nthe majority\nof infected individuals will\nnot have any\ns y m p t o m s ,\nand thus not\nknow they\nhave been infected, remaining as asymp-tomatic carriers throughout their life.\nHowever, 5-10% of infected individuals\nmay go on to develop ATL, decades after\ninitial infection.\nIn the study, the researchers took T\ncells from over 87,000 healthy virus-free\ndonors, asymptomatic carriers, and patients with ATL. Then, using bioinformatics approaches, they sequenced the\nRNA (a simpler, single stranded form\nof DNA, which carries genetic informa-tion) from these T cells, to determine\nhow HTLV-1 causes the transformation\nof infected T cells into leukemic, cancerous T cells.\nUnder normal conditions, T cells be-comeactivatedinordertofightinvading\npathogens.However,oncetheirfunction\nhas been completed, these immune cells\nneed to be turned off to avoid an overactive immune response and excessive\ninflammation. For this reason, activated\nT cells will then express various proteins\nthat stop T cell activation and restore\nthe immune system back to normal. The\nteam revealed that the these immuno-suppressive proteins were constantly\nactivated during HTLV-1 infection , allowing the virus to escape detection by\nthe immune system. Overall, thesystem.\nThe team believe that this persistent activation is crucial to understand how the\nvirus triggers the development of cancer.\nNext, the researchers showed that the\nT cells in individuals who progressed\nfrom asymptomatic carriers to cancer\nwere over-reactive and highly activat-ed. This led these infected T cells to\nover-produce proteins which keep mul-tiplying, or proliferating. This state of\noveractivity is believed to make these T\ncells more susceptibile to DNA damage,\na critical factor in the development of\ncancer.\nWhat is ATL?\nLeukemia is a type of cancer which\noriginates from the blood or cells of the\nbone marrow, and is characterized by an\nincreased number of abnormal white\nblood cells.

    "content": "In 2020, in the United States COVID\n-19 killed 350,831 people according\nto the CDC. This figure represents\nthe highest number of COVID-19\ndeaths experienced by any country\nacross the globe. 602,350 people died\nof cancer in the same year in the US,\nand cancer still took the lead over\nCOVID-19 in death toll even in the\nworst affected countries. It begs the\nquestion: in what way has this pandemic\nimpacted the world\u2019s cancer patients?\nIn a recent interview, Dr Jhon\nSchoonbee, Global Chief Medical\nOfficer at Swiss RE stated, \u201cThe key\npillars of cancer treatment are treating\nthe physical pathology of the disease\nand\u2026 the support we give the patients,\nmentally and socially. During the\npandemic all of these key pillars have\nbeen turned upside down.\u201d\nThe social impact on cancer\npatients\nCancer patients are one of the many\ngroups of people classified as vulnerable.\nAs a result of this status, they have been\nforced to protect themselves for very\nlong periods of time during the various\nstages of the pandemic. In the UK, the\nlongest continuous period of shielding\nfor vulnerable groups was four months,\nfrom March 2020 to July 2020. Since\nthen, there have been other times where\nthey have also been told to shield from\nCOVID, such as in December 2020.\nMoreover, many individuals also chose\nto continue shielding even after the\nadvice from governments changed, in\norder to protect themselves.\nMillionsofcancerpatientswereunable\nor too afraid to do basic everyday things\nand this in turn impacted their mental\nwellbeing. Once commonplace routines\nsuch as seeing family and friends, having\npartners attend treatment with them, or\njust going outside more than once a day\nwere now out of the question.\nThis reality would have a devastating\neffect on the mental health of people\nwhohadn\u2019tbeendiagnosedwithadeadly\ndisease, never mind those already trying\nto cope with a cancer diagnosis.\nIt is clear that patients\u2019 mental\nhealth has suffered as a result of the\npandemic, but there is also\na possibility that it could affect\nthe progression of their cancer.\nVarious academic studies have found a\nsignificant link between mental health\nand cancer outcomes. For example,\na study published by the NCBI on\n\u2018the psychological impact on cancer\nprogression\u2019 found a link between\ndepression and decreased five-year\nsurvival rates.\nTreating the disease\nDuring the pandemic, healthcare\nservices were pushed to capacity. This\nmeant that various non-COVID-19\nrelated services and treatments had to\nbe scaled back or delayed. Amongst the\nservices that were affected were cancer\ntreatments, particularly diagnosis and\nearly-stage treatment .\nThe impact was described in a\npublication by Cancer Research UK,\nwhich stated that 3 million fewer\ncancer screenings took place between\nApril 2020 and March 2021 and that\nthe number of people starting cancer\ntreatments after a diagnosis was down\n42% across the same time period.\nThe same publication highlighted\nthat waiting time targets were also\nconsistentlymissedthroughoutthepeak\nof the pandemic, with 88% of patients\nbeingseenwithintwoweeksofanurgent\nsuspected cancer referral \u2013 the target is\n93%. 5-10 times more patients were also\nleft waiting six or more weeks for results\nfrom key diagnostic tests.\nThe funding issue\nIt is no secret that many of the\nresources, monetary and medical ,\nused to fund and conduct research into\nCOVID-19, were redirected from other\nsources, including cancer research.\nCancer Research UK was forced\nto divert \u00a345 million of funding in\n2021 to ongoing COVID-19 research.\nThis translated to approximately 12\nfewer fellowships, 24 fewer research\nprogrammes, 68 fewer short term\nresearch projects and around 328 fewer\nresearchersworkingforCancerResearch\nUK alone.\nThese cuts will have drastic effects\non the progress of cancer treatment,\nslowing the pace of research. It may very\npossibly cause Cancer Research UK\u2019s\nstated target of 3 in 4 people surviving\ntheir cancer by 2034 to be missed.\nFurthermore, the effect of the\npandemic may be seen for a prolonged\nperiod; Professor Karen Vousden,\nCancer Research UK\u2019s Chief Scientist\nfears that the lack of funding may deter\nresearch talent from entering the field:\n\u201cIt has a knock-on effect. People who do\nbasic research, fundamental research, a\nlot of them can answer very important\nand exciting research questions that\nare not necessarily cancer research\nquestions. So we lose these very clever\nresearchers, who think, \u2018You know,\nthere\u2019s no funding here. I\u2019m going to\nstart working on a different topic.\u2019 Will\nthey ever come back to us?\u201d\nConclusions\nWhile cancer deaths during the\npandemic seem to be similar to pre-pandemic levels, this is likely due to the\nlong-termnatureofthedisease,spanning\nyears of treatment and fighting. The\npandemic\u2019s impact will therefore likely\nnot be reflected in mortality figures\nuntil around the mid-2020s.\nNevertheless, it is evident that every\naspect of cancer treatment and research\nhas been severely impacted by the\npandemic. It will likely take a long time\nfor this effect to be fully felt and even\nlonger for the world to recover.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nTheforgottenC-CancerduringCOVID-19\nJames Desmet Science Writer\nPhoto credits: Nicolas Geiseler Toran, 4th\nYear Mechanical Engineering\n\n"

    "content": "WithGroningendown,oilproduction\nand natural gas supply still lagging\nbehind the recovered post-pandemic demand, and the\noverzealous shift from fossil fuels to renewable energies,\nEurope finds itself amongst sky-high energy prices,\nwith Germany paying the biggest bill. But with Europe\npaying almost quadruple the US price for natural gas,\nthe question arises why the continent was hit so much\nharder by the surge in energy prices than the US. Apart\nfrom the US being one of the biggest Liquified Natural\nGas (LNG) exporters in the world \u2013 well on its way to\nbecomingthebiggestexporterin2022\u2013Europeisstuck\nbetween the adverse consequences of its past decisions,\nunfavourable coincidences and a potential power play,\nall of which influence five major reasons.\nFirst, ensuing last winter\u2019s depletion of natural gas\nsupplies, the continent\u2019s hasty decarbonization efforts\nled to limited domestic gas and coal capacity alongside\na lack of establishing sufficient alternative energy\nresources. Second, Europe also failed to recognize the\nimminent supply shock and replace its limited pipeline\ncapacity with the globally-sold LNG, unlike Asia and\nSouth America, which were the quickest to react and\nincrease their LNG imports, keeping their prices down.\nRendering the situation even more precarious, third,\nthe Netherlands is phasing out Europe\u2019s top natural\ngas producer, the gas field in the Dutch province\nGroningen, as it triggers earthquakes. Additionally, the\nsupply\u2019sfailuretocatchupwithrecovereddemandposes\nthe fourth complication. However, the fifth reason \u2013\nRussia\u2019s limited gas supplies to Europe \u2013 already points\ninto a very different direction: a political one. While\nit stands as a fact that Russian pipeline flows are lower\nthan in previous years, it remains a point of controversy\nwhether the cold Russian winter, increasing domestic\ngas demand, or a political power play to push Nord\nStream 2 (NS2) negotiations stands behind Gazprom\u2019s\n(Russia\u2019s national gas producer) decreased supply.\nSince the situation is quite complex, let\u2019s take\na minute to get an overview. With 55 billion cubic\nmeters of Russian gas imported annually, more than a\nthird of Europe\u2019s gas requirements are already provided\nby Gazprom. Europe\u2019s next step to a secure gas supply\nand the delivery of an emission-friendly transition\nfuel (compared to coal and oil) was the construction\nof NS2, running from Russia through the Baltic Sea\nto Germany. However, German authorities have been\ncontinuously delaying the final legal permission of the\nsecond pipeline. Initial concerns surrounded three\ntopics: the sustainability aspect, Europe\u2019s heightened\ndependency on Russia and the economic burden\non previous transition countries. Ukraine, Poland,\nand the Baltic States accommodate the current gas\nland routes, the Brotherhood and the Yamal-Europe\npipelines, whose transit fees act as significant revenue\nsources, e.g., making up 4% of Ukraine\u2019s GDP. But\nNS2 not only bypasses previous transit countries, it\nalso puts alternative gas suppliers, such as the US,\nat a disadvantage. Hence, the US and Germany are\ncommitted to imposing sanctions on Russia if NS2 is\nexploited as a political weapon.\nNow, I titled the aforementioned concerns as\n\u201cinitial\u201d ones. The situation is much more complex now.\nBecause now, NS2 has grown to be one of Europe\u2019s\nprimary defences against Russia\u2019s menacing invasion\nof Ukraine. Last year, President Putin could not resist\nwriting a 5000-word article \u201cOn the Historical Unity\nof Russians and Ukrainians\u201d, revealing his imperialist\nambitions and distaste for Ukraine\u2019s increasingly\nwesternized culture under pro-European president\nZelensky and putting Ukraine under a \u201cjoin Russia\nor be taken over\u201d ultimatum. Put into practice, Putin\nfears Ukraine\u2019s entry into NATO, which would bring\nthe intergovernmental military alliance right to Russia\u2019s\nborders, and insists on a confirmation that this entry\nwill never happen despite Ukraine\u2019s persistent efforts.\nWith Russia\u2019s illegitimate Crimea takeover in 2014\nand the more than 100,000 Russian troops currently\nstationed along Ukraine\u2019s border in apparent readyness\nfor an invasion, the conflict puts mounting pressure on\nGermany to stall NS2 further, and even cut Russia off\nfrom the Swift global payment system. Nevertheless,\nconsensus stands that Russia is unlikely to actually\nstart a fight with NATO, not to mention that inflation\npressure would hit the impoverished former Soviet\nnation hard. While officially keeping Ukraine out of\nNATO is illegal, it is more probable that the military\nalliance will simply continue calling off any entry\nefforts.\nLooking back to the bigger picture, although\nGermany seems to be the centrepiece of the current\nconflict, it is crucial to recognize that all of Western\nEurope is involved. European gas suppliers harmonize\ntheir energy prices by sharing their resources, and while\nthis strategy helps balance prices in regular times, it\nposes a significant problem in the environment of\nscarce supply. Although the Ukraine-Russia conflict\nremains unbeaten in its gravity, France\u2019s substantial\n10GW worth of electricity exports across Europe\nput the country into the perfect position for another\npower play. Amongst the sky-high energy prices, Spain\nand France have already announced considerations of\nkeeping their energy resources to themselves. France\neven threatened to cut its energy supplies to the UK if it\nfurtherviolatestheBrexitdeal.Whilelimitingresources\nwill push down prices for France, France\u2019s current\nimporters will suffer from an even higher price hike.\nAnd as Germany is a customer, the country\u2019s internal\nconflict, between accepting NS2 to ease its own price\nposition and supporting Ukraine at the potential cost\nof even higher prices, visualizes how high the stakes of\nenergy crisis-induced politics are.\nLaura is a member of the writers\u2019 team at the\nInvestment Society whilst studying for an MSc in\nFinance at Imperial College Business School.\nA fire is brewing in the East...\nEurope\u2019s Energy Price Crisis & its High-Stake Politics\nUkraine is a big news story over the past few weeks,\nbut how could macroeconomics be playing a part in\nstoking tensions between the different sides involved?\nLaura Marconi discusses the factors involved.\nLaura Marconi\nWriter\nOil and gas prices are going up, but is it solely because of our desire to switch to green energy?\nFRIDAY 28TH JANUARY 2022\n29\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nINVESTMENT\nNeed some help understanding the current supply and demand mismatch? Well, imagine a global pandemic is going on, and no one cares about the new iPhone,\nso Apple reduces its production. But right after the pandemic, everyone quickly gets super hyped about the new iPhone, and people storm into the stores to buy it.\nHowever, Apple needs time to increase production again, such that a ton of people suddenly try to buy one of just a few phones. Intuitively, the price of the iPhone will\ngo up \u2013 that is at least until Apple manages to produce more, such that everyone can have one and prices fall.\nNow imagine we talk about the gas you are trying to heat your home with, not the new iPhone, and you are good to go.\nI\u2019M CONFUSED HERE...

It is also more than four times\ncompared to Germany and France. As\nthis data surfaced, the EU has stepped\nup to lead by example and ban the\nongoingproductionandexportofillegal\npesticides,yetastheUKisnolongerpart\nof the union, such legal amendments\nwill not be applicable within its borders.\nBut what is the problem\u2014aren\u2019t\npesticides important for ensuring\nfood security in our increasingly\nunstable environments and growing\npopulations? Yes, pesticides can be\nimportant tools when tackling a\nvariety of agricultural pests faced\ntoday, however, they encompass a\nwide range of chemicals. Pesticides are\nconsistently tested, and new pesticides\nare constantly being developed leading\nto safer options available both for the\nplanet and people (especially farmers).\nSome of the insecticides shipped\nby the UK are the neonicotinoids,\nthiamethoxam, imidacloprid or\nclothianidin,whichcanhavedevastating\neffects on pollinator health. Bees, wasps\nand beetles act as ecosystem engineers,\nas their foraging behaviour allows the\nspreadof flowering plants which provide\nthe basis for a myriad of food chains.\nNeonicotinoids disrupt the behaviour\nand cognition of pollinators and\nincrease their susceptibility to diseases\nwhich can increase their mortality and\nreduce their efficacy in maintaining\nour ecosystems. Furthermore, they\ncan reduce the reproductive success\nof native pollinators, which are\nespecially important for maintaining\nlocal species\u2019 richness. Reductions\nin the populations of pollinators can\ntherefore have downstream effects\non biodiversity losses throughout\nentire landscapes as food sources\nfor other species become depleted.\nPesticides are also continuously\nevaluated to ensure their safe contact\nwith humans, but unfortunately not all\nof them pass with flying colours. For\nexample, paraquat is so potent, a single\nsip of it can be lethal. So much so that it\nhas become a common suicide method\nin countries where it is available and\ncountries that have banned it such as\nSri Lanka have seen major decreases in\nsuiciderates.Butsimilartobees,humans\ncanexperiencesublethaleffectsasaresult\nofchronicexposuretopesticidesandthis\nhas been widely linked to Parkinson\u2019s,\npulmonary and kidney diseases.\nYet despite all the evidence,\nregulations regarding this are wavering\nin the UK. While the problem may seem\nfixed at home, the global ecosystem\nis interconnected. By producing and\nshipping these chemicals to the United\nStates, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and\nEcuador, we are ensuring that it is their\npeople and ecosystems that will suffer\ninstead of us. By its inaction, the UK\ngovernment is actively prioritising the\nprofits of large corporations over the\nlives of people and our planet. But who\nknows\u2014perhaps with the interest of\nthe UK to arrange trade deals with the\nUS, maybe our pesticides will wind\nup right back on our plates one day.\nScience Museum Exhibition: an\nEnvironment perspective\nBANNED PESTICIDES NOTIFIED\nFOR EXPORT FROM THE EU (2018) Main exporting countries\n(banned pesticide exports in tonnes)\nEU\nJapan\nChina\nUnited\nStates\nMexico\nHonduras\nEcuador\nPeru\nChile\nArgentina\nSouth Africa\nRussia\nUkraine\nIndia\nVietnam\nAustralia\nMorocco\nCanada\nBrazil\nUnited Kingdom 32,187\nItaly 9,499\nGermany 8,078\nNetherlands 8,010\nFrance 7,663\nSpain 5,182\nBelgium 4,987\nQuantity of banned\npesticides (tonnes)\n26,000\n(max.)\n10,000\n5,000\n2,000\n1,000\n500\n100\n50\nSources: Unearthed/Public Eye analysis of 2018 export notifications received from European Chemicals Agency or\nFrench/German/Belgian regulators.

    "content": "Happy new year to my beautiful mandem at Imperial, I hope everyone has had some time to\nrest during the winter break and xin nian kuai le to my\nChinese mandem. It\u2019s been a month since my last col-umn, where I talked about Berenjak - a modern Persian\nrestaurant in the heart of London. In today\u2019s segment,\nwe will be talking about Shoryu Ramen a minimalist\nJapanese ramen chain restaurant that is scattered in\na few spots in and around London, such as: Regent\nStreet, Carnaby, Liverpool Street and Shoreditch to\nname a few, (to see their full list please refer to their\nwebsite). Shoryu Ramen specialises in Hakata tonkot-su (pork) ramen of Fukuoka city which is located in\nthe southern island of Kyushu (one of the four main\nislands of Japan). The core feature of this ramen is that\nit is made with a thick, rich, white pork soup and thin\nstraight ramen noodles. like all variations of ramen -what makes each ramen unique is the type of noodle\nbeing used along with the broth that accompanies such\nnoodles. Toppings and other additives are just extras\nthat a chef would use to express their style of cook-ing, knowledge and preference in order to distinguish\nthemselves from other competitors.\nBefore moving onto the foods that Shoryu serves, I\nwant to go through the brief history of ramen and what\nit is about, so you the reader can appreciate the food\nyou eat even more. The Japanese word ramen originates from the Mandarin Chinese word l\u0101mi\u00e0n (\u62c9\u9eb5[\n\u62c9\u9762]), which means \u201cpulled noodles\u201d. There\u2019s a myth\nthat ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s\nby the Chinese neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui\nwho served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni after\nhe became a refugee in Japan. However, a more plausible theory to when ramen was introduced to Japan,\nstates that the dish was introduced in the late 19th\ncentury or early 20th century by Chinese immigrants\nliving in Yokohama Chinatown (just south of Tokyo).\nWhile standard versions of ramen are available\nthroughout Japan, the last few decades have shown a\nproliferation of regional variations throughout the\ncountry, such as the aforementioned tonkotsu (pork\nbone broth) of Kyushu island called Hakata style. Another variation is Miso ramen, found in Hokkaido - the\nmost northern island out of the four main islands. In\nbetween this geographical spectrum you have styles\nsuch as: Tokyo-style ramen which consist of slightly\nthin, curly noodles served in a soy-flavoured chicken\nbroth and Kitakata style that is known for its rather\nthick, flat, curly noodles served in a pork and niboshi\n(dried sardines) broth.\nOf the branches available we visited Shoryu at Carnaby, so if you do attend another branch please keep in\nmind that the experience may slightly vary. The location itself is very vibrant and busy at night, filled with\nmany people on the weekends. Shoryu provides indoor\nand outdoor seating, where the tables inside are more\nspacious and the air is more warm and the outside is active and colourful, with many side-by-side restaurants\nand people walking around.\nShoryu offers an abundance of different ramen com-binations, with your main source of protein being either pork, chicken, tofu or seafood. This gives rise to\ndishes such as: Chicken Katsu Curry, Kimchi Seafood\nNatural and Piri Piri Tonkotsu to name a few. Their\nmost notable sides would be Takoyaki, Chicken Karaage and Hirata buns, which is a cushiony steamed bun\nthat can include fillings such as BBQ pork, Chicken\nKaraage and Pumpkin Croquette. As for drinks, there\nis a wide selection of non-alcoholic beverages ranging\nfrom your standard coffee and soft drinks to alcoholic\nbeverages such as wines, beers and cocktails. However,\nas Shoryu is a Japanese restaurant, they put a big emphasis (rightfully so) on the Japanese alcoholic beverages like Sake, Japanese whiskey, and teas.\nOne thing to note on the overall menu is the lacklustre of vegetarian and vegan options. In terms of ramen,\nthey only have one vegan option (White Natural) and\nin terms of sides their vegetarian options are the Pumpkin Croquette Buns, Edamame, Cucumber and two\nkinds of Salads. They do have a Pumpkin Croquette\nCurry, a twist to the traditional Chicken Katsu Curry.\nHowever, even though they\u2019re not a vegetarian based\nrestaurant, a diversification in vegetarian and vegan options would still be appreciated.\nFor our main meal, we ordered three different ra-mens. The White Natural (\u00a313.90) which is a spicy vegan ramen, the Miso Tonkotsu Ramen(\u00a314.40) which\nis a seasonal exclusive, and the Special Miso Wafu\nChicken Ramen(\u00a313.90). At first glance, the ramens\nthat we ordered were big in volume, and their toppings\nwere generously added. Each ramen had a very flavourful broth, enriched by a variety of flavours which blended together in harmony.\nFor sides, we ordered 8pc Takoyaki(\u00a38.50) and a 6pc\nChicken Karaage(\u00a38.50). To those who don\u2019t know,\nTakoyaki is considered a popular street food and snack\nin Japan. They come in small balls of diced octopus\nwith a slightly crispy batter around it. The Takoyaki\nordered from Shoryu was served with a side of pickled\nginger which added a nice sharp zest in your mouth,\nthat compliments the warm mellow flavour provided\nby the Takoyaki. When bitten into, the soft and slightly gooey interior of the Takoyaki melts in your mouth,\ncreating a warm and comforting buzz. The Takoyaki\nis also garnished with takoyaki sauce and shavings of\ndried fish called bonito and when dipped in kewpie\nmayo the flavours really mesh well together - telling of\nwhy it is considered a comfort food. Chicken Karaage\ncan be described as Japanese fried chicken and is typically made from the deboned thigh of the chicken -providing a more deep flavour than what you\u2019d get from\nbreast. Served with kewpie mayonnaise and a slice of\nlemon, the Karaage was tender and juicy on the inside\nand crispy and light on the outside. Once garnished\nFRIDAY 28TH JANUARY 2022\n30 Food.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nIrasshaimase! - Welcome to Shoryu\nRestaurant Review\nReviewed by Bencan Yalcin Food Editor\nPricerange: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\nSignaturedishes: HakataTonkotsuRamen\nStyle: Casual\nEdited by: Bencan Yalcin\nFood\nOur 8 piece Takoyaki along side some pickled ginger\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nCrispy Chicken Karaage along wih some kewpie mayo\n\n"

    "content": "It is no secret that our planet is broken, and that time\nis running out for us to take the necessary action to\nfix it. \u2018Our Broken Planet\u2019 is a semi-interactive temporary exhibition that should probably become a permanent one, as we\u2019ll likely be fighting the climate change\nwar for at least the rest of our generation\u2019s lifetimes, if\nnot longer. In over 40 objects and images, the exhibition details the many battles that humans can, and\ndo, wage against the loss of biodiversity, increase in\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and the resulting increase in\nthe average temperature of the Earth.\nAs you enter the \u2018Our Broken Planet\u2019 exhibition,\nyou see a vast high-ceilinged room, with simple dark-walls, much like other exhibits in the museum. There\nare numerous small displays scattered throughout this\nroom, mounted against dark grey backgrounds with\nspotlighting. Each individual display highlights a particular environmental issue, or side-effect of climate\nchange.\nOne display entitled \u2018Wheat for a Hotter Future\u2019,\nis of two different varieties of wheat; \u2018common wheat\u2019\nwhich dominates our population\u2019s wheat intake, and\n\u2018emmer\u2019, a sturdier variation that could be more tolerant of our planet\u2019s rising temperatures. It may soon become necessary to adopt a wider variety of food sources as the agricultural sector adapts to the challenges an\naltered climate brings. This would not only increase\nhumanity\u2019s chances of future survival, but could encourage restoration of greater biodiversity, not only for\nplant species, but for animals too.\n\u2018People, Pets, and the Planet\u2019, another exhibit, presents two models of a Canis lupus familiaris (a dog);\none is an English Bulldog, and the other a Samoyed. It\ndescribes how our attachment to owning pets is having\na profoundly detrimental effect on the planet, as their\nconsumption of food and other products is similarly\nunsustainable to our own. The visual juxtaposition of\nthe two varieties of dog is also a reminder of our continued control over the environment and how our domestication of animals has led to somewhat unnatural\nbreeding. The bulldog is often seen as a monument to\nBritain, but consistent inbreeding of these creatures to\nmaintain their iconic look has led them to display genetic health issues such as ear and skin infections and\nobesity that are generally less common in their mongrel counterparts.\nThe interactive stations appear to be designed for\nchildren, but they may also engage adult visitors. These\ninclude an area where visitors can pick up an eco-war-rior sticker, containing slogans describing an action the\nwearer will take to reduce their carbon footprint, and\none where visitors may write a climate-focused idea\nor message on a coloured paper circle and add it to a\ncollaborative wall. A good way to get people thinking\nand engaging with the climate crisis, but one wonders\nwhether there might be more environmentally-friendly\nways to do so that don\u2019t involve the use of disposable\npaper?\nThere are also displays concerning the rapid decline\nin diversity of insects such as bees and butterflies; the\nbenefits and challenges of seaweed farming for the\nfood industry; how jellyfish could be the next major\nsuperfood trend; and whether experimental deep-sea\nmining will be a potential solution to on-land mining,\nor present us with a new way to destroy our home plan-et. These sit alongside a number of contemporary art\ninstallations that are designed to make you think about\nour situation (and appeal to the Insta junkies!) \u2013 these\nincludeafakephonechargingatthewallwithtextmes-sages about power usage, and a mirror with \u2018my species\nreally can make a difference to our planet\u2019 written on it.\nI believe there is more that could be done to make\nthe exhibition itself more sustainable, to reflect what\nit advocates for. However, I also believe that it could\nbe expanded and made a permanent fixture at the mu-seum, as it is thought-provoking and inspiring, and\nbrings to light many of the niches of the climate crisis,\nand I would happily recommend it to anyone who can\nfind the time, and gladly visit again myself. It addresses\nthe question of how we as individuals can and should\naspire to contribute to the repair of our broken planet.\nAfter all, it is still the only one we have.\nOurBrokenPlanet:\nHow We Got Here and Ways to Fix It \u2013 Natural History Museum Temporary Exhibition\nExhibition\nFRIDAY 28TH JANUARY 2022\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe skeletal remains of one of the largest ocean predators haunts the space.\nCredits: Photo/ Trustees of the National History Museum\nReviewed by Zanna Buckland Books Editor\nOur Broken Planet\nWhere?
