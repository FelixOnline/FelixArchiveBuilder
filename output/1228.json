    "content": "clubbing reviews\nEnjoymusicv.2 @\nGoldsmiths College Union\nAfter winding its way around the various universities in the\nland, the Orange tour has finally made it back to London. The\nconcept is simple: Orange and their expert team of light and\nsound people invade a students' union for the night, bringing a selection of top flight DJs with them. The students get a good\nnight out, and Orange get their logo plastered all over the union\nin question. Felix reviewers, of course, just get plastered.\n\"Is it any good?\" I hear you cry. In a word, yes. Despite a slow\nstart at its under-attended London launch, the tour has gained\nsignificant momentum and has sold out nearly every venue it's been to. The stellar line-ups may have had something to do with\nthis, and the night at Goldsmiths Union was no exception. DJ Touche (pic above) and Cut la Roc were the talent on offer, and\nthey were well worth a trip south of the river. Goldsmiths, if you\nweren't aware, is located near New Cross station in south-east\nLondon and is seen by many as the \"anti-Imperial\", with its\nmore than generous helping of liberal arts students.\nWhen we arrived at the venue, we were greeted by a multitude of toys, most of which were familiar to veterans of the\nLondon launch. Again, the glow wall proved to be most pop u lar, with a number of hilarious comedy shadows being pro-duce d. The giant text screen was less good, having been\naltered by the thought police so I couldn't use any rude words.\nThe main difference between this and the launch night was\nthe atmosphere - a packed dance floor of drunken students contrasting with the handful of competition winners and assorted\n\"we're too cool to dance\" media types.\nTouche (see interview, right) worked the dancefloor well, mixing a good variety of records over ll O bpm. My favourite tunes\nof the evening were Max Linen's fantastic Soulshaker and a remix of a Mary J Blige track. In general, Touche's selection of\nrecords, suited the night well.\nAfter shaking my thing for some time, all that remained was\nthe long journey home. Incidentally, I have worked out why\nnight buses now have plastic rear seats upstairs - it's for their\nuseful wipe-clean property.\nINTERVIEW\nwith DJ Touche\nDJ Touche plays regularly at some of the UK's biggest and best\nclubs, such as London's Fabric and The Boutique in Brighton.\nFormerly known as The Wiseguys, he scored a huge hit with\nOoh La La (the Budweiser theme), which made it to number two\nin the UK singles chart. Touche is now one of the star names\ninvolved in the Orange student nightclub tour, and Felix spoke\nto him before his headline set at Goldsmiths (see review, left).\nFELIX: So how's the Orange tour going?\nDJ TOUCHE: It's going all right, it's not too strenuous 'cause it\nonly goes in term-time and you're only doing weekends or close\nto weekends. It's not like doing a normal tour when you're play-ing, you know, every day.\nWhat sort of stuff are you going to be playing tonight?\nHouse stuff really, funky house, nothing too schmaltzy.\nWhatever I play, I like it to be funky, you know, quality shit.\nThere's no point in coming on and playing four hours of really\nblok ey breakbeat - you've got to make it a good set.\nYou've got two new tracks coming out soon - will they be a new direction for you, or more of the Wiseguys sort of thing?\nBasically, The Wiseguys is finished. The Wiseguys was those\ntwo albums, it was on Wall of Sound, and I'm not The Wiseguys\nany more. That was just one part of my career. But even before\nI made The Wiseguys in '92 I was producing house records so,\nyou know, that's always been a part of me. I learnt my trade, as\nit were, making hip-hop beats and house beats.\nSo house music, your new face, it's not about becoming more\ncommercial...\nNo, no, no, it's not commercial. Hip-hop is probably more commercial than house music, d 'you know what I mean? I'm sure\nJay-Z sells more records than the house guys.\nWhat do you think to people who only play one type of\nmusic?\nWell, it depends what that one style is. If you're there playing\none style of music for ten, fifteen, however many years, that's fine, so long as you're good at it and you're innovative. I'm not\nsaying you should try to be really clever and play everything,\n'cause often that's just a complete bod ge you just have to play\nwhat feels right, you know?\nSo which other current established DJs and artists do you\nparticularly like?\nDJs I don't know... I 've always found that a hard one, 'cause I don't actually go out and listen to aDJ unless I'm playing myself\nor whatever. There's loads of artists I like -1 love the Neptunes,\nthey're amazing, and Timbaland as well.\nYou've played loads of the best venues around - what's the\nbest gig you've ever done?\nA top gig for me was Tokyo - playing in Tokyo was amazing. I can't remember the place, it was that one on the Fatboy Slim\ndocumentary. Manumission in '97 I played about four times,\nthat was pretty amazing. Also playing in Sydney was a real\nhighlight for me.\nAlex Dave\n\n"

    "content": "union talk\nShould Imperial College Union join the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)? This is\nthe question that will posed to the students of Imperial College and you will\nhave your chance to have you say.\nNUS So what is the NUS? The NUS was established in 1922 to represent the interests of\nstudents. Currently 98% of students\nunions affiliate to the NUS and Imperial\nCollege Union is not one of them.\nSo what's the fuss about? Well, affiliation to the NUS is a matter for referendum,\ni.e. the students of the college get to\nchoose. There will be a college wide\nsecret ballot with a yes/no question asking you whether you want to affiliate to\nthe NUS.\nThe sides\nIn the referendum there are two sides; the\n\"yes\" and the \"no\" campaign. Both sides\nwill be given exactly the same resources\nand will start campaigning shortly. Each\nside through a variety of media will\nNUS Debate\ninform you of the advantages and disadvantages of joining the NUS. In addition\nthere will be a series of official debates,\nwhere you will be able to hear both sides\nargue their points and be able to put\nguest ions to them.\nThe history\nThe last time there was a Referendum\nwas in 1995, when the students voted not\nto join the NUS. For the Referendum to be\nvalid, there has to be a15% turnout, this\nequates to approximately eighteen hundred students. If this turnout is not\nachieved then the status quo (d is a ff ilia tion from the NUS) remains.\nMy Job\nMy role is as a returning officer is to\nensure that the Referendum is run fairly\nand honestly, and to ensure that you are\ngiven the information to make an\ninformed choice. I am also not allowed to\nexpress any bias towards any one side, in\nfact I am not allowed to vote. If you would\nlike more information about the\nReferendum please contact me (president\u00a9^.ac.uk).\nYour Choice\nUltimately, the decision of whether to join\nthe NUS is yours. So read the information,\nattend the debates and make your choice.\nIt is your chance to have a direct impact\non the future of the Union.\nSen Ganesh\nPresident, Imperial College Union\nElection Inferno\nYes folks, it's that time of year again: that\ntime of year when your walk to the lecture\ntheatre is hampered by a deluge of\nposters. When the Media wing of Imperial\nCollege Union really begins to flex its\nmuscles, with Felix interviews, STOIC\nprogrammes and IC Radio broadcasting\nlive into the Southside Kitchens... When\nmass e mails go out, breaking all the election regulations, encouraging you to vote\nlike sheep for some random student who\nmust be fantastic because they're studying the same course as you. Wow. I love\nthis time of year.\nHustings\nTuesday, Febraury 26: Wye Campus,\nJCR Union Building, 6:30pm Wednesday, February 27: dBs Club Bar,\n6:00pm This is, historically, where candidates\nget a good grilling. Candidates pace\naround the main stairs of the Union build-ing, palms sweating, wishing they hadn't put so much gel in their hair because it's starting to trickle down the side of their\nface. Some turn to cigarettes. And within\nminutes they find themselves standing on\nthe stage. Now the problems really begin.\nQuestions are asked by you lot; completely unpredictable in nature, on a topic that\ngenerally has absolutely minimal relevance to the positions in question.\nFabulous.\nVoting\nThursday, February 28: 10:00 - 17:00\nFriday, March 1: 10:00 - 17:00\nWithout doubt the most important bit.\nWhether you're voting through gut\ninstinct, through detailed character\nassassination, or by bribe from the can di date's other half; the unequivocally vital\nthing here is to vote. In itself, the most\npowerful tool democracy has ever cr eat ed: The secret ballot.\nResults Declared\nMonday, March 4, 12:00 - 13:00\nGiven that voting closes on a Friday,\ncounting is likely to take place over the\nweekend. This means that the \"ceremony\"\n(implying that there might actually be a winner in all of this) will take place\nMonday lunchtime. STOIC will be feeding\nlive audio streams into the JCR, the IC\nRadio team will be poised, mini-disc'n 'mi-cro phone combination in hand, and Felix\nwill be geared up to get an Elections\nSpecial out to the masses by Monday\nnight.\nSo all that leaves is you lot. You have\nthe power to select the direction the\nUnion takes over the coming years. You\nhave the ability to change something, to\nmake a difference. And I beg you, use that\npower. Whether it be through the traditional voting mediums, or through proxy-mg your vote as you may not be in the\ncountry, VOTE VOTE VOTE.\n\n"

    "content": "college news\nHarlington Safe For Now\nHarlington has been saved\nfrom development for the new-terminal at Heathrow, at least\nfor the time being. The news\ncomes after the leak of a confidential government report to\nthe Financial Times recommended that three new runways be built in south-east\nEngland in order to meet predicted future demand for air\ntravel.\nThe release of the report last\nmonth came after the approval\nof a fifth Heathrow terminal by\nthe Secretary of State for\nTransport, Stephen Byers, last\nNovember. As the largest and\nbusiest air travel hub in the\nworld, it is widely believed\nthat the recommendations of\nthe report will inevitably lead\nto the construction of a third\nrunway at the West London\nairport, extending it to possibly engulf land currently occupied by the Harlington ground.\nWidespread opposition\nmeant that it took twelve\nyears to gain approval for\nTerminal 5, and as Harlington\nlies in a designated 'green belt'\narea, it will not be possible to\nbuild such a commercial\ndevelopment without an extensive planning battle,\nmeaning that there would\nappear to be no immediate\nthreat to the medics' cherished\nground.\nHowever, the government is\nalso looking at making\nchanges to planning procedures with an aim of reducing\nthe amount of time spent on\nappeal, which could mean that\ndevelopment could take place\nmuch sooner once planning\npermission is eventually\nsought. If Harlington is to be\nlost, it will raise questions\nabout the sale of Teddington,\ncurrently being discussed.\nNigel Buck, Assistant\nDirector of Estates, told Felix\nthat \"the extent of the planning requirements for runway\nthree are as yet unknown\" and\nthat while the timescale of\ndevelopment cannot be fore-cast, it could be almost a decade before the land occupied by the ground would be\nsought to extend Heathrow.\nSen Ganesh, Imperial\nCollege Union President, said\nthat if College decided that it\nwould be desirable to sell both\nHarlington and Teddington,\nthe Union would need to be\ncompensated for the loss, with\nthe money gained from the\nsales being spent on student\nsports facilities.\nThe College is looking closely at the issue of sports provision for Imperial students, and\nis in negotiations over a multi-million pound new development at Barn Elms in Putney in\naddition to the proposed new\nsports centre in South\nKensington.\nJohn S Issue 1228\n15 February 2002\nEditor: will Dugdale\nDeputy Editor: Ali Wren\nNews Elect: Alex Corby\nNews Writer: John Stratford\nMusic: Dave Edwards\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nSports: Your Mum\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nWith Thanks To:\nAnyone / Everyone\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted by: MCP Litho Limited\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nNew Challenge Election Change\nA new challenge was launched this week with the\naim of promoting good writing\nwithin the College.\n'Writing The Future' will give students who enjoy writing the opportunity to communicate an element of their\ndegree subject to a wider\naudience.

    "content": "music reviews\nINTERVIEW\nwith Tetra Splendour\nTetra Splendour have released two singles so far, and they\nrecorded their debut album last year. Felix spoke to Peter and\nGaz from the band before their recent gig at the Monarch (see\nreview, right).\nFELIX: Could you introduce yourselves?\nPETER: The four of us, we're called Tetra Splendour and we're\nfrom Wales. We all met at school a couple of years back. Three\nof us started off the band doing jazz. That's all we were basically interested in, just playing instruments and stuff. And then\nwe started supporting bands...\nHow long ago was that?\nPETER: About three years ago. Yeah, three years ago, and then\nme and Gaz got a songwriting partnership going.\nWhat have you been doing since then?\nPETER: We toured in September, fourteen dates. We'd never\nbeen on the road before, so that was our first experience.\nHow did that go? What kind of places were you playing?\nPETER: Clubs, toilets...\nYou said you started off playing jazz stuff - was that other\npeople's stuff?\nPETER: I think we kinda jammed our own ideas - you try to be\nas original as you can, I suppose. And we obviously had to\nchange what we were doing just to try to get a record deal and\nmake a living out of it. We just took our influences and basically decided what we'd do. We did the demos and sent them off,\nand that was why we got record companies coming to gigs.\nGAZ: It wasn'ta very sensational way to get signed. I mean, we\ndid it the bog standard way everyone and their bosses had to\ncome and see us before we got the cash. It took a good few\nmonths, maybe six months, maybe even a year...\nHave you been touting yourselves around the student news-papers?\nPETER: [Laughs] Yeah! We did that on the first tour actually.\nGAZ: Student 'papers tend to be nicer, because they tend to be\nless offensive.\nWhat are you thinking about the future then, if anything?\nPETER: Well, we just want to get out of Britain really. Just gig a lot, tour a lot. We just want to up the level of the gigs, get them\ncentred around our live show.\nGAZ: I don't know how much more we can get out of gigs where\npeople just aren't interested, basically. We need to be exposed\nto a larger audience.\nSorry, the tape's ran out. I guess that's it...\nGAZ: Hang on, can I just say one thing? I read an article earlier\n[in Felix], and it was a gig review and I can't remember the\nname of the person. We were associated with the Toploader\nkind of, er, thing. An dI'd just like to mention that.\nReally?! You remember these things?\nG. Yeah. It's just having Toploader on the same page, in the article about us. In an attempt to explain what we were doing. We\nwere quite hurt, frankly.\nRobert\nLIVE: Tetra Splendour +\nFi-Lo Radio @ The Monarch\nStupidly named three-piece Fi-Lo Radio have all the ing redi ents: a female bassist (cf. Pixies, Sonic Youth), a chubby male\nvocalist (cf. Mogwai) and a wild-eyed drummer (cf. any rock\nband). The first three tracks are delivered in the style one would\nexpect from such a trio: good energy, loud guitars and fantastic\nbass, with plenty of tr ad metal and stadium rock influences.\nAll of that goes out of the window on the next three tracks\nthough, as the passion of the opening numbers is quelled by the\nneed to sound marketable. Fortunately, their final track is awesome - screaming alt-metal worthy of The Bastards or Napalm\nDeath, with true stadium kitsch showpiece rock attitude.\nThe New Electrics seem to have been touring Camden for\nyears, playing to their musically and fashionably retarded fol-lowing. The band are a hopeless bunch of posers and posture rs. This is trash for the sake of it, and they can't even do sleaze\nproperly.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGaz seems like the shy, quiet type in person. But when he's at\nthe front of the stage, equipped with a mike and two keyboards,\nan alternative persona is allowed to express itself. And there is\na lot of expression to be found in the music of Tetra Splendour.\nThe background of guitars and drums provides a frame for the\nvaried emotions and accompanying sounds being coaxed,\nwrenched or cajoled from the keyboards. It's not all tortuous,\nemotional stuff though. There's humour in the lyrics as well as\nsimple boy-meets-girl sentiments, sometimes with added\ntwists.\nTetra Splendour would benefit from a larger stage, as their\nmusic has an enveloping capacity similar to the atmosphere\ngenerated at a Tindersticks gig. Oh, and they sound nothing\nlike Toploader.\nRobert\n\n"

    "content": "talk back\nMore From Sen\nDear Felix,\nFollowing the letter last week from Ms Tasha Newton, I thought it would be\nappropriate to respond. I do not intend to\nget into an argument over some of the\npersonal remarks she made, however I thought I should address some of the\nissues raised in that letter.\nThe main concern seems to be about\nCouncil's decision to call for a Referendum on Imperial College Union's affiliation to the National Union of\nStudents (NUS) and the motivation of\nbringing that paper to Council.\nTo answer the later issue first, the\nmotivation is quite simple. Earlier this\nyear with the arrival of the fresher s, the\nUnion had a lot queries about NUS cards.\nMany were surprised that we are not\npart of the NUS. It is clear that a whole\ngeneration of students do not know\nabout the NUS and why we are not affiliated to it.\nContrary to popular belief, there is no\nconspiracy or ulterior motive, it is simply\nthe conviction that it is time to have an\ninformed open debate on the issue. I do\nbelieve that we are capable of having a mature and sensible discussion on the\nmatter and let the students decide. My decision to go for re-election or not is\nentirely irrelevant and has no bearing on\nthe issue.\nIf students don't care then they won't vote - the quota won't be met and the\nstatus quo will remain. However by running a referendum it does give students\nthe choice and the cost to the Union is\nrelatively small and easily covered by\ncontingency funds. All I ask of the student population is to take an interest in\nthe issue and encourage everyone to\nmake a informed decision.\nThe reason I did not give an opinion\nabout whether I believe the Union\nshould join or not, is that as the\nReturning Officer and for the sake of\nimpartiality, I am not allowed to express\nmy view publicly or indeed vote in the\nreferendum.\nI also strongly reject the claim that the\nUnion has not done anything this year.\nWe have built on our support for Clubs\nand Societies, increased external funding and sponsorship, expanded on our\nwork in the community, secured funding\nfor the Summer Ball, supported student\ndevelopment programmes, started volunteer investment programme, refocused on education issues and much\nmore besides.\nI believe we have done a lot but still\nneed to do more. We need to move forward and take a more proactive\napproach and I encourage all students\n(including Ms Tasha Newton) to take up\nthe challenge, get involved in their Union\nand help us achieve this.\nSen Ganesh\nPresident, Imperial College Union\nStupid Is As Stupid Does\nDear Felix,\nI have once again become quite\nannoyed at something petty. This time it\nis stupidity that has got me riled. I recently (i.e.20 minutes ago) purchased\na drink whose bottle bore the label \"Do\nnot store on side when cap is removed\".\nSo that's what I 've been doing wrong,\nhow many now stained shirts could have\nbeen saved if they'd warned me earlier.\nHow stupid must I be?\nThis incident was not the only one of\nits type, a few days ago I was walking\nby the banks of the Thames feeding the\npartially submerged shopping trolleys\nand cooling off from another fit of logic\nwhen I saw a sign that set my attempts\nat relaxation back by several years worth\nof yoga and incense. \"Beware!\" It\nexclaimed, \"Danger of Drowning!\" It's a river, if you are not aware that falling into\nthe river presents a danger of drowning\nthen perhaps you truly are in need of\nwarnings about the spatial orientation of\nbottles, that sucking hot tar into your\nlungs is dangerous or that dancing\npainted black on the Ml poses a slight\nhealth hazard. Are we all so damned stupid nowadays?\nI am also rather worried about my own\ncondition, for the past few weeks I have\nnoticed that my ability to spell has deteriorated and my word order pot to gone.\nCan some charitable soul please tell me,\nis Dyslexia contagious or am I just being\nplain stupid? And in case you weren't aware: This letter is flammable; do not\nattempt to use as a fire retardant.\nYours furiously,\nPete\nWye Balls\nWill,\nHello to everyone reading this in\nLondon and at places other than the Wye\nCampus. We thought that we would just\nlet you all know that life down here is\nbrilliant, although unfortunately we have\nhad to start working and can't just concentrate on social ising. There are many\nactivities going on, Old Boy's weekend,\n1st3 rd February, was a great success\nwith hundreds of people coming back,\nalthough it did see the end to the\nunbeaten rugby season that the team\nwas enjoying, regular activities in the\nunion are proving to be very popular.\nThe main reason for this article is to let\neveryone know about our\nCommemoration Ball which is definetly\non and bigger and better than ever, FRIDAY 21st JUNE! The Commemoration\nBall at Wye is an anna ul event that is\nviewed as the most important evening\non the social calender. It is always a fantastic evening with af unfair, fireworks,\nbands, and a great DJ all preceded by a meal in the marquee. The evening is\npacked with fun and frolics and ends\nwith the survivors photograph at 6am. The bar is open through the night! This\nevent gives you much more freedom than\nis usually experienced in London and\ntakes place in our fantastic Withersdane\nGardens. Accomodation will, be avail-able, although it will be on a first come\nfirst served basis. Tables are for 8-10\npeople although the odd 12 can be accomodate d and we would love to see as\nmany of you here as possible. There will\nbe prizes for the person that organises\nthe biggest party!\nPreceding this event is our cricket\nweek which you are all more than welcome to come down to and is a week full\nof fun and games with the bar open\n11am til lam everday, and as you might\nexpect, the odd cricket match. Both\nevents are situated in the fantastic gardens with the backdrop of a wonderful\ncountryside, slightly different to the wall\nof concrete that they call London!\nIf you wish to contact us for more information about any of these events or anything else to do with Wye life please feel\nfree to do so.\nThomas Bradshaw\nthomas.bradshaw@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "interview film\nSteve Coogan is\nTHE PAROLE OFFICER\nSteve Coogan is probably more famous as Alan Partridge, but\nmost of us know him as the one of Britain's greatest ever come-dian s. To celebrate the 15th February rental release on DVD and\nVHS of his first movie, The Parole Officer, we have this fascinating interview in which he talks about script-writing, film liter a cy, and the effect his upbringing had on his choice of career.\nWas there pressure on you to make an Alan Partridge movie\nfor your first leading role on the big screen?\nI think an Alan Partridge film was mooted very early on. It\nwould have been easier and more straightforward in the industry for me to get the go ahead for that sort of film. But whenever I do something I ask myself what's to be gained from it and\nwhat's potentially can be lost from doing it - and on that I think\nthere was more to be lost than gained from it.\nYou co-wrote the Parole Officer. Was it a hard thing to share\nout the funny lines, and not keep the best ones for yourself?\nIt is tricky. I can remember writing the script with Henry\nNormal (the other co-writer) coming up with a funny line and\nsuggesting it for another character, and Henry would say 'don't you want to say that, it's a really funny line?1\nand I'd say, 'okay,\nyou've twisted my arm'. What I say to people is that I shared out\nthe funny lines, but I kept the best ones for myself. The other\ncharacters do have some good lines after all. I'm generous but\nnot stupid.\nHow different is it, writing for film instead of television?\nIt's completely different, this was a very steep learning curve for\nme. When John Duigan (director) came on board he helped in\nthe writing process and pointed out things that Henry and I would not have foreseen as being problematic. Also there was\na lot more dialogue than I would have been used to in te levi sion, where I have more autonomy. I had lots of discussions\nwith Duncan about the right and wrong way to do something. I had some verbose conversations with him, which all went to\nmaking the film better. Any point that was worth arguing about\nwas argued about and then resolved.\nDoes coming from a big family have\nany connection to your being involved in comedy?\nIt brought out the performer in me to some extent, I suppose.\nPeople often talk to me about middle child syndrome, which I'd never heard of until I became successful, but we were a big\nfamily. We're not particularly touchy feel y, because there's too\nmany of us. So we would express affection by taking the Mickey\nout of people and seeing who can be the funniest, and you did\nhave to shout to get noticed, so there was some of that.\nWhat was the most dangerous or scary stunt you got to do on\nThe Parole Officer?\nSliding between two buildings on a wire was quite scary.\nActors always say they did their own stunts to maintain the\nintegrity of the film, but I did them because they looked like a lot of fun. What you forget is that something simple like falling\noff a chair, which most people could do once with relative physical impunity, starts to hurt when you do it a dozen times.\nFortunately they pad you up.\nDo you find acting on film easier than on television?\nNo, it's a lot more difficult doing this because I know I'm quite\ngood at is being annoying and funny for half an hour. People are\nprepared to sacrifice half an hour of their lives if you make them\nlaugh, even if you're annoying. The difficulty of carrying a film,\nor playing the lead role, is that it's more difficult because I always find it easier to portray myself as being stupid and\nunlike able and idiotic. To play a character who engages the\naudience and is likeable is far more difficult, it's a more subtle\nkind of challenge really. I was guided in that by the director,\nbecause in some ways writing it was easier. Doing it on the set\nwas the difficult thing. How to pitch it, how big to make the per-form ance; often on television you can do a big performance,\nbecause on screen things are amplified. Here more subtlety was\nrequired.\nWould you describe yourself as very film literate?\nI like film, I'm a film buff, but I'm not a film anorak. Some people\nhave pointed out references in The Parole Officer to other films\nthat I didn't know were there. But my knowledge of how to\nwrite films came from watching other films and being influenced by them.\nFELIX ON FILM COMPETITION\nFor fans of the much-lauded TAXI, TAXI 2 will be a hit.

    "content": "reviews books\nThe Bonesetters Daughter\nAmy Tan\nReading the quote on the back of this book could be somewhat\nmisleading, \"told with originality and humour....keeps you\nguessing, laughing and crying until the end.\" Now, even if I do\nsay so myself, I have a pretty good sense of humour but this is\ncertainly not a humorous book, leaving me to wonder whether\nthe Sunday Express critic had actually read it!\nNonetheless, this is a really great novel, not something that\nwill brighten your day, but a riveting account of life's ups and\ndowns from two generations of family.\nThe first part is told by Ruth, daughter of LuLing, who is living in the modern western world. She juggles work, with her\nlive-in lover; Art, his children; Fia and Dory and caring for her\naging mother whose memory is failing rapidly. Her relationship\nwith her mother is tense and this book explores how the relationship evolves as Ruth uncovers secrets from her mothers\npast life in China.\nThe beginning of LuLing's life is buried deep in her memory\nand is revealed in the second part of this book. This is where the\nbook really gets started; the story told by LuLing is both amazing and tragic. Based in the nineteen thirties in a time where\nsuperstition ruled and women were second class citizens,\nLuLing's childhood is continuously disrupted as she is forced to\nmove from one home to another before finally moving to\nAmerica. This novel provides a personal account of the effects\nof war on the individual people involved'.\nLui Ling and her sister, GaoLing, are survivors in the truest\nform and Ruth realizes this as she hears more from her mothers\ntale, eventually she sees LuLing as a selfless woman, scared by\nher own superstitions and haunted by her past. LuLing decides\nto write her life's story down because she realizes her memory\nis fading, and so she writes her tale - the story of the bone set ter's daughter.\nThe Bonesetters Daughter is a wonderfully woven tale of love,\nloss, betrayal and the strength of the maternal bond. An intriguing book that will keep you turning the pages right until the\nend. Published by Flamingo, \u00a36.99.\nThe Summons\nJohn Grisham\nRay Atlee and his brother, Forrest, are summoned to Clanton,\nMississippi, by their dying father, Judge Reuben Atlee. Once a beloved local chancellor who gave money and support to whoever asked, Atlee became a recluse in his last years after he lost\nhis last election.\nHe lived alone and sick, dying of cancer, in a decaying antebellum shamble called Maple Run. Ray has become a successful professor in the law department of the University of Virginia,\nwhile his younger brother, Forrest, has devoted himself to\ndrugs, alcohol and trouble. Reuben, of course, disapproves of\nForrest's lifestyle, but has spent thousands on rehab and legal\nbills for his wayward son.\nLife, though, has had its own pain for Ray. His apparently\nhappy marriage ended suddenly when his wife got a better\noffer from an extremely rich older Wall Street operator.\nRay arrives at Maple Run and discovers not only that his\nfather is dead but also that there is more than three million dollars in cash hidden in stationery boxes in his father's study. A will instructs Ray to divide the judge's assets with his brother\nand to act as the executor.\nRay starts to question where the money came from. He is\nreluctant to declare it as it might prove that the judge was not\nso honourable. He is also unwilling to share it with his brother\ndue to what he would probably spend it on. A more pressing\nproblem for Ray is that someone else knows about the money\nand is determined to obtain it no matter what.\nThe Summons is Grisham writing the kind of novel he has\nbecome famous for while also being the type of novel that his\ndie-hard fans love. Ray is an interesting character who at the\nbeginning is keen to do the right thing but by the end is caught\nup in the intoxicating effects of money. The novel itself is not as\ngood as early Grisham works due to the plot taking a long time\nto get going and the unemotional and one-dimensional prose of\nmany of the other characters. The saving grace for the reader is\nthat the plot does come together well by the end with a very\nthought provoking ending. Published by Century, \u00a316.99.\nJennifer Jonathan\n\n"

I wouldn't recognize a host of music industry names even if I were sober, so maybe I shouldn't be so\ncynical. Anyway, the relaunched Made\n(previously at CC) is still playing a rocking mix of tunes to shake your booty to,\nso who cares who's there, so long as they\nare dancing.\nBrowns itself hardly deserves the\n\"infamous\" and \"exclusive\" tags, unless\nthey got them for overpriced warm beer\npoured by disinterested staff in an\nattempt to make the lig gera ti feel out of\nplace. The beer aside though, the venue\nis ideal for this select night. With its\nshiny red leather, opulent paintings and\nsubdued lighting, the almost Parisian\ninterior allows the stylish gents to\nlounge by the DJ box whilst the honey z cluster across the dancefloor.\nThe list of DJs leaves us in doubt about\nthe music policy. None of these names\nare known for surprising us, but all play\na cool, chilled, boot i licious( or whatever)\nvariation on the same vibe. On rotation\nare: Manny Norte from Kiss FM, Lonyo\nfrom Garage Girls, Jamie Binns from\nSoul2Streets with some soulful (but not\nsoul) flav as to gyrate to, Rachel Bee and\nSteve Webster from Green Island. Mostly\nits a pretty dull, chart y, popular slab of\nvaguely R&B sounds.\nOverall, a harmless evening, with nothing to offend the ears and something to\ngroove to, or even drink warm beer to.\nYou might even spot a few celebrities.\nBling! Bling!\nRobert\nFabriclive\n@ Fabric\nFabric wouldn't be Fabric without the\nusual mile-long queue, but once I had got\nin, that familiar Fabric atmosphere hit\nme: ground-shaking noise and the smell\nof weed. Aii.\nUnfortunately, all the name checking\nmeant that I could only hear one song\nfrom A liB' s set. Good as it was, I wanted\nto hear more from the guy from my local\ntown of Kingston. But I shouldn't have\nfeared, because after him was Howie B doing a live breakbeat session with all\nthe drum machines and synths. Now this\nwas good shit.\nA bit of an unusual name in the line-up,\nJohn Peel was in Room 3. Room 3 is normally the more chilled-out room, but for\nhis set it was heaving. He played some\nold funky vinyl whilst even spinning\nsome new stuff. He wasn't exactly the\nmost active of DJs (well, he is older than\nmy dad); as we stood right next to him,\nhe looked like he was twiddling his\nthumbs deciding what to put on his grocery list rather than choosing which\nrecord to surprise us with.\nJames Lavelle was next, playing some\ndamn fine tunes. Smoke Machine, which\nlasted about ten minutes, was simply\nace. During the Smoke Machine vocal,\nthey covered the dancefloor with smoke.\nSee what they did there?\nLavelle played a more commercial set\nthan usual, with songs like Goldtrix and\nThe Next Level also making an appear-ance.\nIf you haven't been to Fabric, you gotta\ngo - but hurry, because it's beginning to\nget \"underage y\".

    "content": "talk felix\n\"No pain, no gain\" is the mantra of those\nwho willingly submit themselves to the\ntyranny of the regular workout. It also fits\nwith the caricature of Lent, the forty day\nperiod of self-denial before Easter in the\nChristian calendar. If you enjoy some-thing, then give it up for Lent. If it does not\nhurt then it can't be good for you. Get out\nyour old sack-cloths and start sitting in\nashes, it's the season for self-flagellation.\nOf course, there is a more cuddly parody\nof Lent. This first re gui res that the meaning of Easter be reduced to a mammoth\nchocolate puke-a th on. In order to be fully\nprepared for this Olympian feast Lent is\nused as a time to give up all chocolate and\nsweets. This is the Lent of delayed gratification and binging. This fits much better\nwith our culture. Self-denial for improved\nbody image is clearly seen as a very good\nthing. Forget the pressures to conform to\nan idealised body image.\nThere is an ancient and more radical\ntake on the season of Lent. Forget the\nChaplaincy\ncrude self- denial theme of \"give it up\".\nInstead \"take up\" something new. What\nused to be called \"doing good works\" is\nnow known as joining the \"volunteering\nculture\".\nLent could be a good time to start doing\nsomething to make the world a better\nplace for other people. IC already has a host of clubs and societies engaged in\nsocial issues. For example, RAG is operating all year round raising money for good\ncauses. Students on the Pimlico\nConnection help teach in local primary\nschools. The Community Action Group\ngive you a chance to help with the Sunday\nNight Soup Run, or work at the\nNightshelter for the homeless. They are\nalso involved in the \"Tools for Self\nReliance\" scheme that repairs old tools\nand sends them to Africa.\nWhat all of these projects offer those\nwho volunteer are new experiences. Yes\nvoluntary work helps others. But equally\nimportantly it changes us. It can encourage us to go beyond the small worlds that\nwe create for our own protection.\nVolunteering can be a good way to gain\ninsight into areas of life and society that\nwe would not normally visit. By all means\n\"give something up\" for Lent. But also\nthink about \"taking up\" something new. It\ncould do you the power of good as well as\nhelping others.\nIn the Chaplaincy we have a file of volunteering opportunities including journalism for Christian Aid, doing DIY for the\nhousebound, helping community development in Notting Hill, supporting a charity\nassisting people living with HIV/Aids, or\nworking on a building site with the home-less.\nSome need regular commitment and\nsome you can join whenever you are free.\nFor further information contact\nCommunity Action Group icca g@ ic.ac.uk,\nor RAG helen.arne y@ ic.ac.uk or Pimlico\nConnection william.mitchel@ic.ac.uk or\nchaplaincy@ic.ac.uk\nISRAEL ON TRIAL \"This House Believes that Yassar Arafat was Right\nto Refuse Israel's Terms at Camp David\" PHYSICS - LT1 - THURSDAY21 st6:00 pm IC Secular Society\n\n"

    "content": "club active\nUltimate Frisbee\nDiscdoctors arrived at Bristol\nwith a confidence that they\nwere better than most teams at\nthe tournament. The first game\nwas won with ease, Doctors\nwinning 13-0 against a very\nunder strength UWE. Doctors\ndidn't even break into a sweat.\nThe next game was a little\nmore of a challenge, as the\nPicnic 2 team did in fact turn\nup. Doctors played a solid\ngame, scoring six points in thirteen minutes with one point in\nreply from an inexperienced\nPicnic 2 team. As Al rightly\nsaid at the end of the game, it\nwas a good practice for us.\nThe next game was a tight 3-2 win over the Slurry Slingers\nfrom Surrey. Although Doctors\nwere clearly a better team,\nsomehow the Surrey players\nmanaged to keep it very tight\nand it was as close as the score\nsuggested. This was, however,\nthe turning point of the to urna ment.\nThe next game was against\nthe tournament veterans, Mr\nMen. Unfortunately, they managed to find five players for the\ngame against us, so our tactics\nhad to change a little. We\nplayed solidly against their\nzone, but couldn't find the scoring pass. Despite having continued possession, the Mr Men\nwon the game 4-0. This result\nleft Doctors second in the first\npool, taking us into the second\nround guaranteeing a top ten\nfinish.\nThe next game was against\nMythago, and Doctors knew\nthat they were a much better\nteam than them. However,\nscoring again proved to be a problem, and we lost the game\n6-4. Despite a good attempt at\na comeback, Doctors had left it\ntoo late, and the game was in\nthe hands of the home team.\nThe crowd were certainly on\ntheir side, which perhaps\nhelped diminish the Doctors'\nspirits.\nAfter that disappointing\nresult, the Doctors were confident that they could beat the\nPurple Haze team, seeing as\nman for man, we were a much\nbetter team. However, after a very poor start, the Doctors\nheads dropped, and we were\nhumiliated 8-0.\nThe Sunday morning, after\nan uneventful party, Doctors\nwere rejuvenated, and knew\nthat the skill within the team\nwould take us to a good finish.\nA match against Bears woke\nus up... to a loss. However, we\nwere definitely a better team\nthan them.\nThe next game was against\nPurple Haze Old Boys. We were\nconfident that our superior fitness would take us to an easy\nwin over the aged players.\nAfter a good start, Purple Haze\nOld Boys came back, and then\ntook the game 5-3 (or something like that).\nThis left us with a ninth-tenth place final against the\nold foe, Slurry Slingers. On the\nbigger pitch, the Doctors clearly made use of their speed and\nmore accurate passing, and\ntook and early 4-0 lead. Then\nthey relaxed a little, and the\nSlingers came back to 6-5. The\ncrucial pass to level it 6-6 was\ndropped by a slinger, and the\nDoctors went on to take the\ngame comfortably, ending up\nninth in the tournament. But\nwe're a better team than that.\nTim\nIC Virgins\nWomen's Rugby\nWednesday, 6th February\nWe All Tramped Eagerly\nRound London On Gertrude's Goat Eventually Descending\nMount Herts Yodelling And Really Should have Excelled.\nSunday, 10th February\nIC Virgins 0 27 Vets\nIt was a fine sunny day, and\nwe arrived at Harlington with\nhope and love in our hearts.\nWe've been concentrating on\nour intensive training regime\ninvolving Classy yet Camp\nFabian and Dave (no comment\nthere Charlotte, nudge nudge\nwink wink), hoping to improve\non some aspects of our game.\nEvil cap-ee-tan lost the toss,\nbut still we started strongly\nwith a lot of possession and\nmade some territory, after that\nalthough we had a share of\nthe possession we were made\nto work hard to keep out the\ntries.\nTackling and support were\ngreatly improved off the back\nof last Sunday's match and\neveryone had a stunning\ngame.

    "content": "reviews music\nLIVE: Alien Ant Farm + Dredg\n+ Vex Red @ Brixton Academy\nYou probably think that Alien Ant Farm are a bunch of tw at s. You'd be wrong. That dubious honour goes to Dredg (sic), probably the worst band I 've ever seen live.\nAs the second support band, Dredg proceeded to utterly\ndestroy any atmosphere created by openers Vex Red, for whom\nthe crowd went nuts despite the fact that their music was utterly formulaic. Soft verses, loud choruses? Check. Alternating\nbreathy and strained vocals? Check. Jumping up and down to\naid the \"rock\" look? Check. Angsty lyrics? Dyed hair? Snazzy\nthreads? Check, check, check. Not bad, but I wouldn't slit my\nwrists if I never heard them again.\nDredg were four accountants making turgid music in the general style of Tool, only worse. The singer had a nice voice, but\nhis range consisted solely of three notes. Also, the spray-paint-ed naked woman they had watering plants onstage departed\nafter one song. None out of five, plus a sound beating.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo the scene was set for Alien Ant Farm (pic above) to amble\non, arse about for an hour and annoy me. Instead, they provided a thoroughly entertaining evening's entertainment. They\nstand out from the nu-metal hordes by injecting a healthy dose\nof melody into every song and by generally being fun.\nThey're awesome musicians too. Dryden Mitchell has a fine\nvoice, and he really sustained the tunes in the acoustically-chal-leng eden or mod rome that is Brixton Academy. The incredible\nrhythm section were rock solid, which was even more impressive given that the bassist stomped about like a gorilla in the\nheat, playing behind his back and gur ning for his country.\nSmooth Criminal was undoubtedly the highlight, sped up and\nadrenal is ed into a version that not even Wacko Jacko could\ncomplain about.\nLIVE: Staind\n@ Brixton Academy\nHaving sold over six million copies of their album Break The\nCycle, one of the biggest bands in America come to Brixton\nAcademy for one reason, and that is to rock. Ably supported by\nPuddle of Mudd, Staind put on a show consisting of slick\nsounds, introspection and sheer power that will be difficult to\nmatch.\nDon't make the mistake of tossing Staind in with the rest of\nthe current crop of nu-metal bands - trust me, they are definitely more like old-fashioned rock, with some grunge chucked in\nfor good measure. On production albums, they raw k, sing ballads and draw you in close to the speakers to make sure you\ndon't miss the message. Live, things are no different. No matter\nwhich song they're playing, from the acoustic-sounding\nEpiphany to the all-out rock of Can't Believe, Staind get into the\ncrowd and get your body moving.\nPlaying live, Aaron Lewis is a bit of a strange frontman - at\ntimes, he is right up front serenading the crowd with his powerful voice, but on other occasions he can seem detached, as if\nit hurts to sing the words. At these points, Staind find a more\nthan suitable second lieutenant in Mike Mushok, who makes his\nguitar sing with the passion that obviously flows through him.\nAnd this is the ultimate word for Staind playing live: passion.\nThey ooze passion, right from Lewis' vocals to April's drums, as\nif they are begging you to come in closer, expend your energy\nand then think about what is wrong in your life and how to\nmake it better.\nOutstanding songs of the night are Open Your Eyes, Fade,\nSuffer, a full band version of Outside and encore song It's Been\nAwhile. Outside is brilliant, because of the sheer intimacy and\nintensity of the performance. Fade and Suffer show the ease\nwith which the band can transfer from calmness to madness in\ntwo chords and bring the pit along with them. Open Your Eyes\nand It's Been Awhile are very slick reproductions of the album\ntracks, with a certain extra flavour.\nAll in all, a very good concert, let down only by the odd bout\nof over-introspection from Lewis.\nKunal Tank\n\n"

    "content": "society revue\nLast Thursday saw this year's international night coming\ntogether after months of\npreparation and work by the\nOverseas Committee Team,\nand specifically Ram\nRamanan, the organiser of the\nevent.\nThe concept of the event is\nfor the international societies\nto have an opportunity to\nexpress their own cultures to\none another, as well as to the\nnumerous home students who\ncome to watch the event every\nyear. In the past it has been\nmarred by political differences,\nwhich have been expressed by\nstudents booing various acts,\nand in one case even storming\nthe stage. This has also led to\npunch ups back stage, and\ntherefore this year, there were\nmore stewards present to\nensure that the security of the\nevent was not compromised.\nPerhaps due to this, or\nmaybe perhaps due to improving relations, there weren't any\nsuch problems this year, how-ever, the flagship show caused\nproblems of its own, through\nthe use of pyrotechnics that\nset the fire alarm off. This\nresulted in the mass evacuation of the great hall, as well as\nthe rest of Sherfield, that lasted around half an hour.\nHappily most of the audience\nwere eager to stick around,\nand so thirty minutes later the\nHall refilled to enjoy the first\nshow. However, any mood that\nhad been built up would obviously have been destroyed by\nthis point, so the first act of the\nevening, which belonged to\nthe Pakistan Society, was to\nhave gui tea job getting everyone back into the mood.\nHowever, the choice was good,\nand the comedy based on\narranged marriage brought the\nshow back up to its original\ntempo, paving the way for the\nrest of the show.\nInternational Night\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n^\n4 \u2022\n>\n\u20221\nIt would be impossible in the\nspace allowed to go through\nevery act, and while some\nwere certainly... interesting, all\nhad clearly received a lot of\ncare and attention from each'\nsociety.\nThe problem with a show\nsuch as this is that cultural differences are very difficult to\nexpress in such a short amount\nof time, and since no-one can\nbe aware of all cultures, often\nmisunderstanding can occur\nas to the point that is trying to\nbe made.\nAs an example of this, one of\nmy personal favourite acts was\nthat of the Singapore society,\nwhich I found very reminiscent\nof the time I have spent in\nSingapore over several\nmonths. I'm not sure I would\nhave found it so good, how ev er, were I not already aware of\nsome of the culture.\nAsking around after the\nshow, I found that three shows\nhad really stood out in many\npeoples' minds. They were the\nAfro-Caribbean Society, the\nJapanese Society, and the\nBangladeshi Society.\nThe Afro-Caribbeans put on\nan amazingly high energy\nshow, and were also remembered for the lack of clothing\n/ t they were sporting.\nJapan was a very funny\nshort play based on the adventures of Super Mario, with all\nhis friends and enemies\ndepicted by cardboard cut\nouts, all accompanied by that\nirritatingly catchy tune from\nthe game.\nThe Bangladeshi Society\ncould be seen to be the conscience of the show, with probably the most political act,\nshowing a man's trip around\nthe country in a rickshaw,\nobserving the beauty and pain\nin the country.\nAlso I must mention Shovi\nand Ruth, who did a fantastic\njob of holding everything\ntogether with their presenting,\nand keeping us amused during\nthe scene changes.\nWhat really got me, how ev er, was the after show party.\nEveryone from all the societies\nwere there, and I have to say\nthat for the first time in five\nyears at this college, I realised\nhow truly international we can\nbe.

    "content": "club active\nRugby Firsts\nRugby - sponsored by FITZPATRICK\nThe match started with a quick sensational try scored\nby Ricky, the Italian international, finally over his barrel\nspell of two years! All the\nmerit really goes to the\nNigerian international Aci, back from a nasty injury, and\nyet again proving his tremendous talent and skills with a prefect-timed pass, which cut\nthe back line and reached\nRicky for an easy try in the\nmiddle of the post, easily converted by Huy.\nWith 7 points behind us in\nthe first two minutes, all the\nboys were looking pretty confident and with sensational fly\nhalf Chen-Cheun playing as\nscrum half and ginger boy\nBobby at the fly half, the game\nbecame very interesting!\nBobby kept on kicking the ball\nso high that it could be ^\nmistaken for a landing I airplane, giving the\nball to the opposition! He eventually scored a. \u2022\ntry in the \u2022\nmiddle of the\npost giving us\na14 to nil advantage thanks to his famous eyebrow dummy. The first half\nseemed to end up with a corner try by the opposition...\ngood effort from medics boys\nbut frankly really not good\nenough! That's because Aci quickly responded with an\ninterception and scored a magnificent try in the middle\nof the post for\nan easy con-version from Vietnamese\nj lF sensational PJT Chen Che un( Huy) bring us 21\n5.\nThe second half started\nwith the medics well up for a big turn of the game in their\nfavour but, as if it could ever\nhappen, they did not get anything better than a drop goal\nin the middle of the second\nWr to\nhalf (after two attempts).\nDefence from IC first was brilliant with the boys all over the\nplace and keeping GKT well\nout from their twenty-two. No\nmore points were scored and\nthe match ended up 21 - 8.\nAnother victory for the mighty\nIC first and another medics\nteam defeated. (Gosh! I'm tired of beating Medics\naround).\nWith the last game of the\nleague played, IC now faces\nthe big challenge of the BUS A plate and even more challenging Guttridge Cup. God save\nCaptain Sven! (Praying is\nprobably his last hope for\nfinally finishing a game!)\nRugby III\nIC III 12 Essex II 32\nWe waited, and waited and\nfinally the coach arrived an\nhour late, Rich. The thirds\nwere on a mighty tour to the\npits of Essex. Walking out\nonto the pitch with 14 men\nthanks to a clearly inept referee was our first kick in the bol-locks. However, this really\ndidn't affect our play! The\nmatch began and after some\ngood ruc king by IC we were in\nthe opponents 22, but it was\nnot to be with a quick turn\nover they stormed down the\nfield and dropped the ball over\nour line... however it was a try. Their kicker, who seemed\nto have replaced his foot with\na coat hanger, missed the con-version. Our casual approach\nto the game and blatant bias\nfrom the ref led to another 3\ntries from the inbreeds.\nHowever, after half time we\ncame back to storm over the\nline. If Nightingale's first\nname had been Florence there\nwould have been more\npatients dead than at the\ncharge of the light brigade;\nwith an ability to catch second only to Graham Norton's with soap in a prison shower\nthe turnover in play helped\nthe MacDonald'sm in gers to\nslip another two past. The\nmighty Imperial came back to\ndish out more shoe pie and\nscored a magnificent try from\nDesmond the monkey. The\njourney back was more eventful with Matt \"Taffy\" Laffan\nvomiting everywhere, after\nonly 3 litres of cider, and Svet\nthe captain groping various\nrandom team members and\npronouncing \"hip hop forever\".\nEven though we failed to\nuphold Silva's good name we\nmanaged to grope her sister in\nHombres later on.

J Knight Fever?\nPossibly the worst\ngag on the front\npage, ever. (Page 21)\nUnion Suffers Budget Cut\nFollowing the research assessment exercise last year, the results of which were\ndescribed as 'fantastic' by our Rector, Sir\nRichard Sykes, the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England (the council\nthat determines government funding for\nfurther and higher education) has decided to cut funding to College, despite the\nfact that our rating (6.68) was higher than\nlast year.\nThis seemingly perverse decision is\ndue to the fact that although we did better than we did last year, we actually\nimproved less than other institutions\nnationally, and so get a lesser share of the\navailable funds, which have themselves\nnot increased in the last year. This\ndecrease in funding will hit all non-aca-demi c departments that rely on College\nfor money, including the Union.\nUnion finances were already looking\nstrained for the coming year, as extra\ncash needs to be found to fund, amongst\nother things, the 8% rise in sabbatical\nsalaries, necessitated by the increasing of\nthe grant from the Engineering and\nObsolete from next year?\nPhysical Sciences Research Council\ngrant, to which these salaries are linked\ncontractually. As College will only fund\nthe first 2.5% of salary increases the Union\nwill be forced to cover the shortfall.\nThese two issues combined are going\nto force the Union to cut costs even further than had been previously thought,\nand it is feared that clubs and societies\nwill, once again, take the brunt of the\nUnion's cost-cutting. Sen Ganesh, Union\nPresident, has, however, assured Felix\nthat although funding is extremely tight\nand many parts of College will face cut-backs, the Union should be able to make\nup this shortfall by improving the efficiency of the central administration, without\nhaving to drastically reduce the funding\ngiven to clubs and societies.\nAll this could, however, prove to be a blessing for students, as amongst the proposals being discussed by Union authorities to improve efficiency is the scrapping\nof activities card. Instead of providing\ninsurance for those with a card, all members of the Union will be covered as a matter of course.\nIt has been revealed to Felix that the\nadministration costs incurred by the system of forcing those students who wish to\nbe covered by the Union's insurance to\nsign up for activities cards are far greater\nthan the savings gained by not insuring\nthose without cards, and so the possibility of change is being looked into.\nAlex\n\"Imperial Rag Week begins today,\nbringing with it seven full days of\nmx^^mo^^m song and good pcL\nfa shi id si I1g| Sounds good to me...\n\n"

At lunchtime there'safe te on the Queen's Lawn,\nfollowed by collections around the City from 1pm, and the\nhuge Back 2 School party che z Union from 8pm. So, Rag Week, huh. Is it really that time of year already? Blimey. Lots of messing\nabout and being silly, isn't it? Well, erm, yes, pretty much. Except that it's messing\nabout and being silly for a reason, Y 'see, while Rag is supposed to be\nfundamentally fun, offering you the chance to have a laugh, try something new or\njust make a complete fool of yourself, it's also about raising a shed load of money\nfor charity along the way - in fact, this year's Rag events have already raised more\nthan \u00a35000 for a variety of good causes. This week, however, every event,\ncollection, sale and party will be helping to raise money for Rag's official charity, The\nShooting Star Trust, a Twickenham based outfit who want to open West London's first hospice for terminally ill children by the end of next year.\nSet up in 1995, the Trust will provide a respite for young people suffering from\ncancer, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis and cerebral palsy, so that they (and their\nfamilies) can live out their lives in a comfortable, reassuring home, rather than on a hospital ward. However, having already bought a site for the centre and raised the \u00a36\nmillion needed to get it built, they now need more money to kit out the hospice -everything from specially adapted beds and toys to IT tools and kitchen equipment.\nAnd that's where we come in. A few hundred pounds will buy a bed or learning toys;\na few thousand pounds will kit out a bedroom or furnish the library or play room; a few tens of thousands of pounds could buy a new minibus, or fit out an entire wing of\nthe building... You get the idea. Ultimately, though, the point is that this is a small\ncharity trying to do something really great on a small scale - they haven't got\nhundreds of dedicated fundraiser s or national sponsors, so every penny raised this\nweek really will make a difference. To find out more about what that really means,\nvisit www.shooting star. org.uk, or check out the Rag website at www.su.ic.ac.uk/rag.\nOf course, much as we might want to, there's no way that any of us could possibly\nafford to fund the Trust on our own. However, by getting out onto the streets of\nKnightsbridge, Westminster and Canary Wharf, having fun and rattling a few\ncollecting tins at passing multi-millionaires, together we can make a difference - it's corny, but it's true. And, as a great man once said, you can't say fairer than that...\nHopefully, you're now fully convinced of two things. Firstly, that Rag\n- doing some good doesn't necessarily have to be dull. Secondly,\nthat all this playing around, dressing up and getting blind drunk\nreally is all for a good cause. And thirdly that you really,\nreally, really want to get involved. Sorry, three things - it's fun. It's for a good cause, and you want to get involved\nAnd that you want to buy a ticket for the Balloon Race\n(available for just a pound from stalls in all good\nJCRs\u2122). No, four things, four things... And that\nyou'd better ring your mum and ask her to post\nyour school tie down to you, ready for next Friday.\nAnd that you could really do with one of those free\nt shirts. And that... Damn, I 'll come in again...\nis fun\n\n"

    "content": "film review\nOcean's Eleven\nreleased 15th February\nAt the 2001 Oscars Steven Soderbergh made history by becoming the first post-war director to get two of his films, Traffic and\nErin Brokovich, Oscar-nominated in the best director category.\nBut does that give him the right to make a movie that is so\nlightweight that it could get in the ring with Naseem Hamed?!\nApparently so. It does. Give him the right. To.\nHaving just been released from prison, Danny Ocean (George\nClooney) rounds up a gang of about a dozen or so professionals\nto rob three of Terry Benedict's( Andy Garcia) casinos in one\nnight. For a reason which still remain a mystery to me, he calls\nhis crew 'Ocean's eleven'. And that, listeners, is where\nSoderbergh subsequently got the title of his movie. How the\nfacts fall into place - like the pieces of an elementary jigsaw.\nOcean's Eleven is perhaps more remarkable for its acting lineup than anything else. Clooney's posse includes Matt Damon,\nBrad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and famous Chuckle brother, Barry\nChuckle. And there's even a cameo from Lennox Lewis. They\nmust have spent a fair few dollars getting this lot together. In\nfact, rumour has it Barry Chuckle was paid by the second.\nUnfortunately, the movie suffers from there being too many\n'stars'. There is no central performance and none of the acting\nis daring enough to carry it through to the ending.\nThere is very little that can be said about this film apart from\nthe fact that it is highly predictable and formulaic. Everything\nabout it is formulaic. The dialogue, the acting, the wafer-thin\nplot. You know from the start they're going to get away with the\nheist. / don't care if I 've just given the plot away! Because as\nImperial Students you should be able to clock that one straight\noff.\nIf you're looking for some lightly flavoured entertainment, I would recommend salted crisps. Not a bunch of over-paid ego-maniacs playing out their over-indulgent childhood fantasies\nby robbing a casino. Nothing more to say, so I'm just twiddling\nmy thumbs. Just sitting here typing away, trying to finish off\nthis review. Look how the end is getting nearer. It's a Monday\nmorning, and the grumbling of my stomach reminds me that I forgot to have breakfast. But I never have breakfast anyway. Eh?\n\u2022 Dar lUS Cool and Crazy\nreleased 8th February\nThough a few degrees colder, this simply made documentary is\na Nordic version of Buena Vista Social Club. Knut Erik Jensen's film follows the male voice choir of Berlevag, a30 strong group\nfrom the harsh surroundings of Finnmark. Wrapped up against\nthe elements, they sing the first of many haunting, melancholic\npieces concerned with the natural world and the trials of life.\nWe are introduced to various men from the choir including\noctogenarian brothers, an ex-addict, the local com mie and their\nwheel-chair bound conductor. We learn about their respective\nprivate lives and their views on the choir to which they are all\nso loyal and which offers respite from the bleak reality of life in\nthe town. Despite the huge differences in age, the group are\nvery close and supportive of each other. The local fisheries may\nbe closing one after the other, but the sense of community running through all those connected to the choir is clearly strong.\nThere is little plot to speak of, barring a visit to the Russian\ntown of Murmansk to take part in a concert. The choir is keen\non taking the trip, and all are amusingly eager to flirt with some\nlocal Russian ladies, teasing their partners about waltzing with\ncomely babushkas. Once into the former Soviet Union though,\nthe group are truly shocked at the surrounding environment, so\nalien to their unspoilt homeland. A blazing row breaks out on\nthe coach between the communist and virtually everyone else\nonboard, as he tries to defend this raping of the landscape.\nThe documentary is filmed at a languid pace, without voiceover\nor incidental music. All we are exposed to is the choir members\nthemselves. Their personalities come through strongly and their\nfrequently amusing stories are shot in a deadpan style.\nIt is a shame that the musical scenes are what let the film down.\nWith only limited concert footage, we are shown countless\nstaged scenes of the choir, in varying locations, with the camera panning up and down the line of singers. This gets tiresome\nand only adds to the sense that we are being sold the accompanying soundtrack, but what we learn in the rest of the film is\nfascinating and more than makes up for this repetitive ness. Cool and Crazy is being currently shown at the Renoir (020 -7837-8402) and the Odeon Wardour Street (0870 -505-0007)\nAdam Joyce\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nSingles\nRoundup\nBEVERLEY KNIGHT Shoulda Woulda Coulda\nThis British R&B artist (pic above) has never really made it\nbig, although she's always in the background. Hopefully this\nsingle will elevate her status. You can guess from the title that\nit's all about regret and what could have been. There's a lot of\nfeeling here, but it doesn't sound soppy thanks to a good backing track. This has something more than the standard R&B bal-lad, which makes me think that it should do well.\nID Oscar\nIAN BROWN Whispers\nThis is the monkey king's best 45 since, ooh, I'm gonna stick\nmy neck out here and say... Fool's Gold. The track starts with\nskittering electronic bleeps and synth washes, before kicking\ninto one of those scally-funk choruses which seem to have\nbecome his trademark. A definite return to form. It's good to\nhave him back.\nTommy Mack\nMULL HISTORICAL SOCIETY - Watching Xanadu\nThe latest bout of catchy, bouncy, fun-filled guitar pop from\nColin Maclntyre and associates is well worth getting hold of,\neven if the lyrics are a little difficult to understand.\nUnfortunately though, the B sides on the first of the two CDs\nleave a lot to be desired. The second CD is a much better bet,\nas it contains the delightfully continental-sounding Sad Old Day\nTo Be Down and the highly amusing video for Watching Xanadu,\nfeaturing Colin himself in a pair of red velvet bunny ears.\nJess\nCOMPETITION WINNER\nKei-Tee Tiew, a post grad in EE, has won a copy of the\nsoundtrack to the film How High. Kei-Tee knew that\nRedman's latest solo album is entitled Malpractice.\nOUT THIS WEEK The following are due for release on Monday 18 February:\nALBUMS AIR - Everybody Hertz\nTANYA DONELLY - Beautysleep\nLO-FIDELITY ALLSTARS - Don't Be Afraid Of Love\nSINGLES\nA Nothing\nMAXIMILIAN HECKER - Polyester\nTELEPOPMUSIK - Breathe\nVEX RED - Can't Smile\n...and also the Beverley Knight, Ikara Colt, Middlerow and\nFreeheat singles (all reviewed below)\nSPIRITUALIZED - Do It All Over Again\nThis is a happy little ditty - very happy. In fact, so happy that\nit will corrode the very core of your cynical self, replacing it with\nlittle fluffy bunnies, so be warned. Bunnies aside, this has the\ngospel feel of many a Spiritualized track, with loud piano chords\nand even tambourines. It would work very well live, but, as it's the only track on the CD, this gets very wearing after the tenth\nplay. Never mind.\n\u00bb \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Jamie\nIKARA COLT - Rudd\nIkara Colt, it seems, are an up and coming indie band, for\nwhom random shouting is clearly the order of the day. Indeed,\nthis single has a large helping. Dischords and distortion are certainly close to their hearts too. The end result, a strange cross\nbetween The Hives and Clinic, rather unexpectedly grew on\nme. If that sounds like your thing, then it might be worth keeping an eye on this band...\nJamie\nMIDDLE ROW Right Proper Charlie\nThis UK garage piss take sounds creepily like The Shamen's Ebenezer Goode (cockney rapping, crap rhymes) and attempts\nto do for coke what that track did for E. It doesn't really work,\nnot least because Charlie turns everyone into a loud-mouthed\nself important w anker and therefore deserves no celebration.\nIt's a shame, because when a decent MC comes on, this isn't actually a bad track. But it's not as funny as they think it is.\nTommy Mack\nFREE HEAT Retox\nThese guys are just your normal indie band but with two\nsingers - one man and one woman. This makes the first song\nThe Two of Us sound alright, but the lyrics are a bit dod gy. The\nEP starts uptempo, slows down and then is supposed to finish\nwith a bang, but it all sounds very average. The songs sound\nsame y and none of them really stand out. Although this isn't ter-rib le,I 've heard it all before.\nOscar\n\n"

    "content": "music reviews\nLo-Fidelity Allstars\nDon't Be Afraid Of Love\nOut this Monday on Skint records\nAt a recent Felix Music meeting, a fellow\nreviewer tried to p rise this recording\nfrom my hands with a viciously wielded\nbottle of Bombay Sapphire, stolen from\nthe editor's private gin stash. I stubbornly refused to hand it over, risking life and\nlimb and probably making an enemy for\nlife in the process. But was it all worth it?\nLet us investigate...\nDon't Be Afraid Of Love is album number 3 from the British beat meisters and\nFabricLive regulars, and it seems like\nbusiness as usual. Lord \"big-ass\" Beats\nand his trusty sidekick Prince Bouncy\nFunk Bass mingle socially with Mr and\nMrs Indie Vocals, sipping from cocktails\nlovingly constructed by the Bigbeat barman at a private seventies-themed party\nin the Sheffield suburbs.\nEvery now and again, Lord Beats disappears to get some more special brew\nfrom the fridge, and Bass and Vocals are\nallowed a little privacy to indulge in\nwhat the locals may once have called\n\"chill out\"( a phrase now only heard coming from the lips of Radio 2 presenters\nand Telegraph columnists, thanks to a certain Mr Moby). At various points\nthroughout the evening, a couple of\nfriends (star-spectacled Bootsy Collins\nincluded) turn up to share a beer, chew\nthe cud and use the loo.\nThe whole event passes swimming ly. Everyone grabs their coats and agrees\nthat \"Yes, we really must do this again\nsometime soon\". As the party disappears\nslowly over the horizon, I sit back and\nthink to myself \"Sorry Patrick, I wouldn't trade this for a bottle of rope y spirits any\nday of the week\".\nNine Inch Nails Tanya Donelly\nAnd All That Could Have Been Beautysleep\nOut now on Interscope records\nNine Inch Nails have always been something of a guilty pleasure for me. Or\nrather The Downward Spiral has, since\npretty much everything else they've done\nhas struck me as either boring or ridiculous, and I'm still unsure as to why their\nsecond album doesn't have the same\neffect. Accordingly, I approached this\nnew live album with caution, as it contains a mere four Spiral-era songs, compared with six tracks from The Fragile\nand six earlier songs.\nI was thus pleasantly surprised to find\nthat the album is, for the most part,\nexcellent. Songs from their debut release\nPretty Hate Machine benefit greatly from\nincreased guitar and sample content,\nwith Terrible Lie and Head Like A Hole\nrocking like water buffalo.\nThe songs from Spiral are predictably\ngreat, and indeed the only weak points\nare the boring-as-hell tracks from their\nmost recent work. Aside from their goth-by-numbers titles, songs like The Frail\nand The Wretched must have bored the\narse s off the live audience, and they\ninspire instant use of the skip button.\nThe album ends, of course, with Hurt,\nstill the most moving song to come out of\nthe industrial genre.\nIt's a good listen, then. But counting\nagainst it is the fact that a live show from\nthe mid-nineties - or, more to the point, a copy of The Downward Spiral - would be\ninfinitely better. If you have every other\nNine Inch Nails release, you'll probably\nbuy And All That Could Have Been any-way. If you don't, then buy my favourite\nalbum-that-you-love-in-spite-of-itself,\nand stop there.\nOut this Monday on 4AD records\nTanya Donelly is something of an alternative music legend, having been a founder\nmember of Throwing Muses, The\nBreeders and Belly.\nThrowing Muses were one of the great\ncollege bands of the 1980s, with Kristen\nHersh's folk/punk songs providing the\nsoundtrack to many a tortured teen's life.\nThe Breeders were formed by Donelly\nand the Pixies' Kim Deal, in an effort to\ntake a break from being second bananas\nin their main bands. After a couple of\nexcellent Pixies-style albums, they went\non a seemingly endless hiatus.\nDonelly then formed her own band,\nBelly, who seemed destined for the big\ntime when their debut album went gold\nand the single Feed the Tree became a mainstream radio hit. It wasn't to be,\nhowever, and Donelly disbanded Belly\nand released her first solo album in 1997.\nSince then, she has released very little,\nmaking this, her second solo album,\nsomething of a comeback effort.\nSadly, Beautysleep is pretty under-w hel ming she seems to have lost the\nknack of writing catchy songs in a misplaced search for atmosphere.\nConsequently, most of the tracks feature\nbarely-there vocals over a fuzzy\nguitar/organ sound, which makes for\nnice background music but little more.\nThat said, some tracks do stand out;\nThe Night You Saved My Life being a case in point, with (gasp) audible vocals.\nAnd there's the rub: singer-songwriter\nmaterial suffers when the songs play\nsecond fiddle to the sounds. It's nice\nenough, but you never feel compelled to\ncome back to it.\nBen Toby G Toby G "

Nick Keith\nand Laurie, three of the clubs\nmore \"mature\" members joined\nus with their collection of\nantique (a shooting term\nmeaning fun but wildly in acc u rate) firearms.\nThe Sky was clear and the\nfresh country air entering our\npollution conditioned lungs\nendowed us all with superhuman powers. After a brief\nshopping trip to buy enough\nammunition to make even the\nseasoned locals look uneasy\nwe set up for our day's sport.\nBen, Dan and Phil went to the\n50 metre range to do some\naccurate shooting with their\n.22 target rifles. The rest of us\nmade ourselves as comfortable\nas we could in the muddy field\nof the 200 yard Short Siberia\nrange. Yu and Jordan did some\nexcellent shooting with the\nscope 7.62 rifle. While Jacob's new (in geological terms at\nleast) Number 4 saw some\nheavy use as everyone wanted\nto have a crack. Jacob's various claims that his poor shooting was due to the sights, the\nbarrel, the ammunition and an\nunmerciful God were roundly\ndisproved by everyone else\nachieving near pinpoint acc u racy.\nAfter a quick spot of lunch\nwe were rejoined by our small\nbore friends and given a demonstration of the true\nmeaning of accuracy with Laurie's civil war vintage\nPeabody. Through expert\nshooting he was able to make\nall the rounds reach the end of\nthe range with some even hitting the target. At this point,\nhalf the group split off for an\nafternoon of clay pigeon shooting while the rest persevered\nwith the rifles. The day saw the grand unveiling of the\nclub's new3006 which garnered approving comments\nfrom all who used it. Despite\nbeing of first world war vintage it shot perfectly well and\nthe bull received repeated\npeppering s from all.\nAll to soon the cl axon sounded and everyone had to return\nto the big city where our re-exposure to the smoke and fumes turned us back into mild\nmannered students. Thanks\nmust be given to Ben's brother\nfor his chauffeuring duties. We\nwould also like to point out\nthat no animals were harmed\nin the making of this trip.\nIf you fancy trying your hand\nat rifle shooting, or clay\npigeon, air pistol and other dis-c ip lines, the Imperial College\nRifle and Pistol club meets at\nthe range in the Sports Centre\non Wednesdays from 1pm to\nlate and Saturdays from 1pm to\n6pm. Anthony\nCross Country\nAfter an exciting start to the\nrace in Guildford, things began\nto settle down, with Imperial\nathletes in contention. With\nthe women only having to run\nhalf the distance of the men,\ntheir enthusiasm was displayed with Louise once again\ntaking control of the race, finishing strongly in2 nd place.\nSarah also ran well, for IC's A team to finish 14th. In the men's race IC's teams\nwere heavily depleted, missing many of their star runners\nwho had performed so\nadmirably at BUSA. Despite\nthis Francois showed his class\nand led the way for the IC\nteam, finishing 2nd. Close\nbehind were Chris in 5th, and\nRoly in 12th. Dave missed a turning, but\nfortunately his faithful teammate 'New Boy' Dom was in close attendance and showed\nhim the right way, with them\nultimately finishing 13th and\n14th, and Jeff was close\nbehind in15 th. Guy, Seb and\ndebut ant Michael all ran well\nto help the B team secure\nanother strong finish.\nDan after his exploits at the\nweekend (cycling from\nPenzance to London for a bet!)\nmanaged to work his way through the field to finish 28th. Behind him were the ever\ndependable Mike and Gil. Mike suffered great problems\nwith his new spikes that\ncaused.severe bleeding to the\nback of both heels, yet still\nmanaged his best race of the\nyear.\nAfter this Imperial went back\nto continue the organisation of\nthe 54th Hyde Park Relays.

    "content": "Editorial\nfelix talk\nThis week, I have mostly been ill. And this is probably the worst part of my job\nhere. Even when I'm dying with 'flu, and\na temperature of 104,1 still have to get up\nand make sure that this gets out so you\nlot have something to read during lec-ture s.I wouldn't mind so much if I though\nyou all read it for the insightful journal-ism, or the stunning design and layout, or\neven for the well rounded editorial, but as\nfar as I can reckon, you don't. You read it\nso you can do the crosswords and the\nGFQQ. Is this really true? AmI really\nwasting my time (and health) to provide\nyou people with two pages of puzzles and\na protective covering of emergency toilet\npaper. I'd like to think not.\nSo, what I'm asking is that you, the\nreader, take a moment right now (or at\nleast once you've finished the crossword)\nto sit at a computer and e mail me, telling\nme what it is you do and don't read in\nFelix. Not only will it make an old man\nvery happy (or possibly not), but it also\nmight mean that less of the bad stuff will\ngo in, which would logically imply that\nthere would be more good stuff. Or at\nleast a greater percentage of good stuff.\nBut yes, ill. I 've been. And most horr i bly. I'm too young to die, and too beautiful\ntoo. It would be denying the world of per-fec tion, and as such, for all your sake s,I'm hanging on to this life with afer v our. Sorry, I get a touch melodramatic when\nfeeling ill. Also, considering the number\nof little pills I 've taken, I'm probably hal-luc in a ting. And much fun it is too. Why,\nonly this morning I was talking to my\nlampshade about the quality of life that\nhaberdashery enjoys, and I was sorely\ntempted to turn it all in and become a cushion.\nBut foolishly, I did not, and so here I am,\nwaffling away. Oh yes! E mail address. To\ne mail me with your comments about\nFelix (and I really do want them), use the\naddress felix@ic.ac.uk is my advice. You\ncould use another address and trust in\nthe mighty god of the internet to guide it,\nbut I find that's about as reliable as dousing for jam in a sausage factory. As my old\ngrandmother used to say.\nHigh time I ranted about something,\nnow, I think, being an editor and all. This\nweek we have RAG week coming up, and\nto be honest we here in the Felix world\nare pretty moist at the thought... many\nphoto opportunities and stories of drunken debauchery galore. At least, that's what I 've been promised. However, once\nagain, dear reader, it is you who must\nactually ensure that this promise comes\ntrue. And you don't want to make a liar of\nthe person who promised the promise, if\nyou see what I mean, and I think you do,\ndo you?\nSo that was nice. I have one hour until I have to send this fine tome off to out\nfriendly neighbourhood printers, so I should probably cut this short, and just\nwrite blah for the rest of it, but frankly I'm too professional, so like every good actor,\nI will instead whisper rhubarb repeatedly\nunder my breath. Rhubarb rhubarb\nrhubarb rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb.\nWye Campus, JCR Union Building South Kensington, dBs Club Bar\n5pm Tuesday, February 26 6pm Wednesday, February 27\n)<n Sabbatical Elections \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 nc oNe ge J> union "

    "content": "felix talk\nIC RADIO\nMatt and Sam, the dynamic duo of radio,\nare rarely visible to the public eye. They\nexist in a fantasy world, removing themselves from society as a whole. However,\nafter some coaxing but mainly blatant\nthreatening they have emerged, dirty and\nsmelly, from their hermit cave in the furthest reaches of Outer Bayswater to give\nthis exclusive interview to Felix:\nSo, guys, why did you call your show\n'The Matt 'n' Sam Show?'\nMatt: Well, we were going to go with\njust 'and' but for artistic purposes we\neventually went for 'n.' Sam: Lack of originality, really...\nWhat's your show all about?\nMatt: It's an orgasmic blend of sensuous music, hilariously amusing features\nand sickeningly professional links.\nSam: Yeah, complete bollocks really...\nDo you have many listeners?\nMatt: Yes\nAnother high quality web-cam photo\nSam: No. Sorry, it's his ego. By the way\nif any wants to listen in we'd really appreciate it. Talking to yourself for two hours\nisn't fun... no honestly!!!\nWhat sort of music do you play?\nMatt: Not telling you.\nSam: The wan ker's in a sulk now. Don't worry, just give him one of those lollies\nand he'll shut up for while...We play\neverything from up-to-the-minute dance\ntracks to classic tunes from MC Hammer\nand Nick Kershaw... actually we don't really play his songs (nervous laughter).\nMatt, since leaving IC last summer\nyou've only made a few appearances on\nthe show, leaving Sam to flounder through\non his own. Sam, you've been reported to\nbe suffering from chronic suicidal de pre s sion, as illustrated in this photo. What do\nyou have to say?\nSam: Well, yeah, it's depressing sitting\nthere on your own but it's probably better\nthan being stuck in there with this boring\nbastard!\nMatt: At least I don't cock up the\nequipment all the time.\nSam: Try and do the show without me\nthen you cheeky bastard...\nAt this point the interview degenerated\ninto something out of Mortal Kombat, the\nscenes are not suitable for children, students and domesticated animals.\nYou can tune into the Matt 'n' Sam show\nevery Saturday at midday on IC Radio999Mhz AM and ic radio. com.\nAlternatively you couldn't. ICU Arts Festival\nThe ICU Arts Festival is an event especially dedicated to promoting the arts\nsocieties of Imperial College. The first\never arts festival will take place from the\n20th February to the 1st March this year\nand will feature everyone from the IC\nChoir to Classical Guitar. This is your\nchance to see exactly what each arts society does, and maybe even find out what\nyou have been missing out on all this\ntime.\nThere are three nights that you should\nput into your diary, with the times when\neverything begins.\nWednesday, 20th February, Union Concert Hall:\n7.30 Wind Band\n8.00 Classical Guitar\n8.30 Interval\n9.00 DramSoc\n9.30 Musical Theatre\n10.00: Finish\nThis event is completely free.\nMonday, 25th February, dB's, Union:\n7.30 Guitar Soloists\n8.00: Modern Dance\n8.15: Interval\n8.30: Modern Dance\n8.45: Contemporary Music\n9.15: DJs\n9.30: Close\nThis event is completely free.\n8pm Friday, 1st March, Great Hall:\n[In association with the ICU Arts Festival]\nThe IC Symphony Orchestra and the IC\nChoir will be performing Mahler together,\nin what will undoubtedly be a fantastic\ndisplay of musical talent.\nTickets Available from the Blyth Music\nCentre, \u00a32.50/\u00a36.50 in advance, \u00a33/\u00a37 on\nthe door.\nThere will also be exhibitions from Photo\nSoc, Phoenix (Literature), Leonardo (Fine\nArts) and the Origami Society taking\nplace around campus at lunchtimes.\nThe ICU Arts Festival's debut is sure to\ngo with a bang - but it doesn't end there.\nThis is to be the first of many annual arts\nfestivals happening at Imperial College.\nThat means that any IC student who has\nmissed out on being involved this year\nhas now got twelve months to prepare for\nthe next one.\nThis really is a unique opportunity to\nshowcase your work and get yourself\nnoticed as a performer, artist or musician\n- or whatever you can do!\nBut this isn't the only way, to get\ninvolved. You can help run the events this\nyear, or if you want to decide how the ICU\nArts Festival 2003 goes, you can form part\nof next year's committee.\nSo don't forget, the ICU Arts Festival is\nhere to show that Imperial College isn't just about science\nPatrick\nFor more information:\ne mail: patrick.h oar@ ic.ac.uk\n\n"
