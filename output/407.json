    "content": "s PEIIX\nReviews FELIX Rock pile\nIan Morse takes a look at some albums released over the holidays^\nIT HAS OFTEN been said that what\nmakes a good pop album is an LP full\nof potential hit single s.ELO have\nachieved just this with their new album\n' Face The Music'( Jet Records). After\nthe grand oise montage of classical snip bits that start the record the band\nget down to the business of making 'an\nLP's worth of toons'. As well as the\nobvious influence of the Beatles( some\nmight say over-influence) Jeff Lynne draws his composing inspiration from\njust about everyone that has come and\ngone, all the melodies containing that\nsnatch of plagiarism that makes the\nlistener think ' Christ now where have I heard that before?' But then when you come\nto think of it, such a connotation is irrelevant, as far as pop music goes.\nAll the songs are melodically very strong,\nincluding the new single 'Evil Women',\neach one produced to their full commercial\npotential. The last ELO album showed\nthat at last Lynne was getting to grips\nwith his string section, and here too it\nis arranged to tasteful effect, not suffering\nfrom the over indulgence heard on the\ninitial albums particularly the first under\nthe co-leadership of' Roy Wood' who as\nit just so happens has a new all-purpose\nall solo record on the market \u2014 'Mustard'\n(Jet records). Wood still seems to be\nsuffering from one form of indulgence or\nanother.\nTo be honest, I have no idea what\nWood is trying to prove with this album,\nand neither I suspect, does he. As you\ncan imagine the man ends up playing all the instruments himself, a sort of orchestrated Don Partridge \u2014 as welf as singing\nand producing the songs. Every possible musical instrument and style is crammed\nonto the vinyl, giving little breathing\nspace for a direct musical form to manifest\nitself. The overall effect conjures up\nvisions of say, the Andrews Sisters and\nKenny Ball in hectic combat with the\nmass pipes of the Scots Guards! (Honest!)\nUnly once does Wood allow a simple\nmelody to progress gradually, ironically\nthe piece is called 'The Song!\nUnfortunately, one out of nine does not\nmake a good album.\nFrom the opening few bars of 'Spirit\nOf The Boogie'( Polydor) by Kool and\nthe Gang, you grasp immediately that\nKool' s street-funk is aimed more at the\nbody rather than the brain. A predictable\nfunk rhythm started up by the drummer is followed by the equally predictable husky\nspade voice telling everyone to 'Get on\nup\" y a'lF and ' G it it on \u2014 eh!' But why\nnot? The music is only for dancing to\n(isn't it?) and as such its just fine.\nSolid rhythm's laid down with very little\nthought given to melody and even less to lyrics \u2014 in fact the only time the\nband come unstuck is when they try to\nvary the pace with slower material, which turns out to be a lesson in almost total\ncrassness talking of which brings me\nto the latest release by those Twee Twins Graham Nash and David Crosby, who have\ngot together with peace and tranquility to\nproduce 'Wind On The Water' (Polydor).\nBut to be fair this record contains less of\nthe em barra sing sent i mentalities of Nash or the absurdities of Crosby' s previous\nwork (for instance, Simple Man and\nAlmost Cut My Hair respectively). The music is strong with creditable playing from everyone concerned, the string\narrangements two are generally well conceived and are employed sparingly\nthroughout. Lyrically I must admit I 've\nnever rated Nash noT Crosby. Have they\never said anything? The same goes for\nthis album. Try as I have, to me they\nremain confused ramblings.\nHowever, superficially pleasant this\nalbum is, the fact remains that the\nreputation of Crosby and Nash is built\nlargely upon their past work wit h greater\nmortals that is Stills and to a greater\nextent Young. For me they have yet to\njustify their million dollar earnings with an\nartistically viable record. The same cannot\nbe said of John Cale, who has received\nwidespread critical acclaim for much of\nhis past work, but who's new album\n' Helen of Troy (Island) leaves much to be\ndesired.\nRumour has it that this album consists mostly of previously rejected material\nthat has been re-vamped by the artist,\nAfter listening to it, I haVe no reason to\ndoubt this, the majority of songs being\nsubstandard Co ie offerings. The lack of\nconsist ant cy does not only apply to the\nsongs, but also to the overall feel of the\nalbum. For instance, many of the tunes\nhave lush string arrangements, 'China\nSea' is sung in such a whimsical fashion,\nit would not be out of place on a Kevin Ayr es' album. Coupled with these we\nhave 'Cable Hogue' and Leaving it up\nto you', which judging by the neurotic\nrendition given to them by Cale, can only\nbe described as straight-jacket rock.\nOnly a few of the numbers are anywhere\nnear Cale s' past work, the best being\nthe opening cut 'My Maria , which features\nthe fine guitar work of Chris Speeding.\nThe rest are barely adequate. No way is this record up to the high quality of\nwork previously associated with John\nCale. I suppose it is inevitable that anyone\nwho chooses to call their album ' King Brilliant as Howard Werth has done, takes\nthe risk of running the critical gauntlet.\nLet me be no exception. One of the main\nfaults with this record is what seems\nsuperficially to be a good move on\nWerth's part \u2014 getting one of rock's top\nproducers (Gus Dudgeon) to handle his work. Whilst his theories on production\nmay run syn on i mou sly with the bland\nsongs of Elton John, I find his clinical over production totally alien to Werth's style of writing. Much of the record is\ncovered in needless orchestration making\npotentially good straight forward songs\nsound decidedly fay. On the whole\nking average.\nOver production could hardly apply\nto the new record by West Coast stalwarts\nHot Tuna. Judging by Yellow Fever( Grunt Records), the band seem to be in a sort of late sixties time-warp, totally\nindifferent towards what has happened\nto music in the last six years. Boogie still seems to be the message with this\nheavy-mental trio who turn the amps up\nto maximum volume and proceed to crash\ntheir way through instantly forgettable\nsongs that guitarist . Jorma Kaukonen\nprobably thought up the previous night.\nI have little else to say of it except no\nBritish band would smell a recording\ncontract playing this stuff today.\nWhich brings me lastly and least to the\nNancy Nevins Album (Tom Cat records).\nWho, you may ask, is Nancy Nevins? Believe me it's not worth your bother to\nfind out. I was presented with this album\nfor purpose of review several weeks ago,\nbut still cannot make any criticism of it \u2014\nbe it constructive or otherwise. Apart\nfrom saying that she sings like a nightclub\nlush, writes all her own songs (which\nsound remarkably like imitations of just\nabout every-female style from Peggy\nLee to Carol King, I am at a total loss for words.\nTHIS WOMAN IS COMPLETELY DISPOSABLE!

Unfortunately it\nappears that few people outside\nthe specialist clubs, such as\nthe Mountaineering Club, are\nnow aware of the existence of\nthe Exploration Board.\nThe Exploration Board have\nsponsored during the five\nyear period from 1970 to 1974\na total of twenty-two expeditions\nto all parts of the world. These may vary from botanical\nand zoological expeditions to\nthe atolls of the Maldive\nIslands, or a purely exploratory\nand photographic expedition\nto the Rift Valley in East Africa, to a caving expedition\nto the Peruvian Andes. The Exploration Board is able to\ngive advice and financial\nassistance to groups of\nStudents from this College who w ish to organise expeditions\nwhether exploratory or scientific to any part of the globe.\nApplications or en qu ries for possible expeditions in\n1976 should be made as soon\nas possible to the Secretary of\nthe Exploration Board, Mr. J FD Lauwerys, Room 534, Sherfield\nBuilding, internal telephone\n2703.\nWomen's Studies Course\nTHE WHITBREAD CUP\nThe draw for the first round will be posted in the Union Bar.

    "content": "FELIX It\n\u00a3UBS2L\nMissed opportunities\nImperial College A's14 THIS FIRST GAME of the\nyear came to life in the second\nhalf, in which there were\nsix \" tries, and which ended\nwith a well-deserved victory\nfor the money men.\nFirst blood was to the Bank\nwhen they kicked a penalty\nafter an A's player was offside.\nThe A's reply was' not long\ndelayed. The ball was won on\nthe left and passed right down\nthe backs. Lynne Davies, on\nthe wing, was caught, but\npassed back inside to Chris Becque who put Bob Leeson over for an excellent try.\nComplacency then set in, but\nnot for long. Bank scored a try from a penalty almost on\nthe A's line. The score at\nhalf time was4 \u20149 to Bank. The A's were looking\nforward to playing with the\nwind but a swift try from\nthe Bank damped down the\nenthusiasm with which the\nA's opened the second half.\nPulling themselves together\nthe A's moved into their best\nperiod of the game. From a scrum fifteen yards out Rich Jenner broke away and fed\nGeorge Sweatman who scored. Dick Pullen was unlucky\nwith the conversion, the ball\nhitting the post. He made\nExcised\nExtras\nExcel\nIC Extras XIII 19\nMiddlesex Hospital 4\nCOMPUTER ANALYSIS dictated\nthat the Extras' play with no\nwings due to a shortage of\nplayers. So Middlesex rejoiced\nbut remained conventional.\nThrough good defense\nand attack we held our own\nfor the first and pointless,\nhalf hour. Eventually the\nExtras took the lead for a penalty but Middlesex soon\n'replied with a try to make the\nscore at half-time, 3\u20144.\nThough having the wind\nbehind them in the second half\nIC took twenty minutes to get\nout of their own half. A fine\nrun after a good clearance\nfrom Bob Stern enabled Steve\nto bulldoze through three\nplayers to score a try; his\nfirst for two years. Then\nscrum-half Simon Whaley made\na blind side break and carried\nanother three players over\nthe line for a try. Some fine\nplay then followed involving\nGerry Molloy and Steve Jenkins which enabled Mike Gibson to\nsprint away and score beneath\nthe posts to clinch the match.\nBank of England 29\namends with a penalty a few\nminutes later, reducing the\nlead to three points. Enthusiasm\ndisplaced science for the' A's and enabled Bank to break\naway. and score. Dick Pullen again reduced the margin with\na penalty, making the A's nine points adrift but still in\nthe game. Then Bank scored\ntheir last try and clinched\nthe game. Th a A's did not\ngive up and for the last ten\nminutes Bank were kept under\nconsiderable pressure. Gyn\nDavies was unlucky not to\nscore at- that time. He was\nbrought down only three yards\nshort of the line having run\nhalf the length of the field. It was a good game with\nwhich to open 1976. There\nwere missed opportunities but\nnevertheless the A's gave a good performance.\nThank you, Martin Cotter,\nfor refereeing. You did such\na good job that the lynching\nhas been post phoned for a week.\nTeam:- R Pullen; L Davies;\nC Becque; R Leeson; J Pitcher; J Thomas; G Sweatman;\nB Bubb; J Day; M Zawarotko;\nK Hawkins; S Downing; C Cuthbertson; R Jenner; G Davies.\nORIENTEERING\nFlat grounds\nfavours IC\nLAST SUNDAY witnessed\nImperial Colleges greatest\nentry to date into the realms\nof Orienteering. Twelve brave\nand intrepid runners descended\nupon Ranmore Common determined to give their all, and\ncomplete their respective\ncourses before closing time.\nThe forest itself was ve'ry\nrun able and fairly flat, giving\nhope to those 'runners' amongst\nus. Indeed the ' A' course of\n6.8km was completed in 42\nminutes by our dazzling Captain Dave Rosen, three\nminutes clear of his nearest\nrival, to give him a decisive victory. Somewhat further down\nthe field came Alan Leakey\nin 60 minutes, followed by a wave of Cross Country Club exiles, Ron All in son, Steve\nWebb, Mike Welford, and many\nmore.\nMeanwhile, back on the ' B' course several newcomers to\nthe sport were learning about\nOrienteering using the trial\nand error method. Keith\nSugden was the first Imperial\nrunner home, in 90 minutes.\nFOOTBALL\nGrimwade\nreturns\ntriumphant\nIC 1st XI 1\nLAST SATURDAY saw IC\n1st XI play their Annual\nfixture against Corinthian\nCasuals. The IC midfield was superb in this game, making\na mockery of the conditions\na fid at times their opponents.\nGrimwade, looking every inch\nthe talented young Star we\nknow him to be, made this a triumphant return to 1st class football (After falling foul to\nDirty Pat Frampton early last\nterm).\nFor long stretches of the\ngame he directed play in the\nmiddle of the park, combining\nwell with Singleton and the\nHorny Welshman Roberts. Some\nneat inter-changes in midfield\nled to several penetrating raids\nin the 1st half. Up front, Steve\nGee was as elusive as ever\nand Lindon, using the murk as\na camouflage surprised his opponents on a number of\noccasions but didn't surprise\nhis team mates when he\nfailed to score.\nNil each at half time and\nthe Casuals with the wind at\ntheir backs pressed hard for a goal. The IC defence however\nCorinthian Casuals1 was not to be pierced for a long\ntime into the half. Gentleman\nJimI ley, \" the big bearded\nbastard at the back defended\nsolidly and Dooley and Howley\nwere both constructive. The\ngoal was eventually conceded\nwhen our makeshift defender\n(formerly a myopic midfield\nschemer) let the ball through\nhis legs for the centre forward\nto hip in for an easy one.\nIC did not have to wait!\nlong for an equalise r.I ley,\nsallying forth from defence, a sight rarely seen these days*\nlaid a mouthwatering ball to\nwinger dirty Terry. Terry,\nswivelling around, flight eda wicked cross to the far post\nfor Steve Gee to nod down into\nthe path of Grimwade who made\nshort work of putting it into\nthe net. One each and they\ndon't come much better than\nthat.\nWith just five minutes left\nthe casuals fought hard for a winner but didn't get it thanks\nmainly to Kev Allen in goal\n{hands like fly paper).\n/ A good result for IC and\nsurely a game to remember.\nLACROSSE\nNightmare ending as\nKenton crush IC\nImperial College 5\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE Lacrosse Club played its first match of\nthe term on Saturday, 10th January.\nThe match started very\nwell. We had a full team for a change, and within the first\nfive minutes Martin Smeaton\nhad scored the first goal\nof the match. Shortly after\nthat he scored another and\nthe Happy Hacker scored a third. But although the defence\nwere working hard Kenton did\nget two goals back, so at the\nJust how much was learnt\nwill be revealed at Great Wood,\nPotters Bar next Sunday. An yone interested in trying the\nsport should attend our\nThursday evening meetings at\n5.30pm! n the Union Lounge\nor contact Dave Rosen\n(Astronomy).\nKenton ' A'14 end of the first quarter IC,\nwere 3\u20142 in the lead and feeling\nconfident.\nThe second quarter was a lot harder and despite the\nattack. In particular two of\nour recruits, Pete Watson and\nRichard Forster, fought hard\nfor possession but failed to\nscore. Meanwhile the Kenton\nattack began to really pile on\nthe pressure. Even though\nthe defence were having a hairy time, Bill Jackson managed to summon up enough\n\u2022energy to run from our goal, watch as Kenton's defence\nsplit while they marked their\nmen, and run up to the opposition\nand score. Beautiful. Half time, Kenton lead by 6\u20144.\nThen something happened.\nSomehow the spirit went out\nContinued on back page\n\n"

The album, which has a rather nice\npicture of her on the front of the album\nsleeve, is by no means one of the best\nalbums I 've ever heard. For a debut LP it is very slickly produced and you\neasily get the quite correct impression\nthat Ms Brooks has been around for\nsometime.\nShe used to front with a band called Pally when she first started in the\nbusiness and then progressed to doing\nrecordings with the critically acclaimed Vinegar Joe band who never did crack\nthe ice as far as th.e record buying\npublic is concerned.\nAnyway, to get on to her album. It's not a fantastic album but it's well\nproduced. The tune that really stands\nout above all the others is ' He' s a rebel' (a re-run of the old Gene Pitney\nsong 'She's a rebel').\nOther tracks worthy of note are\n'Where do we go from here (Rich man's woman)' and ' Jigsaw baby' on side one\nand 'One step on the ladder' on side two.\nwith some good west coast session musicians a fairly good rock album has\nbeen put out but one feels that Ms\nBrooks may find herself in . a similar\nposition to Vinegar Joe if she doesn't add a bit more bite to her next offering.\nJAWS2 \u00ab S with R CSU Meet Stan's Bar\n. 7.00pm Tue20 th Jan\nTickets \u00a31.30 from\nR CSU office\nDon't forget the UG M1.00p mTu es20 th Jan\nPhysics LT3 Utopia Limited :\na suitable case for reappraisal\nThe Times ranked it firmly above \"The\nGondoliers\" and claimed that\nGilbert and Sullivan had written\nnothing so good since \"The\nMikado\".\nThe Daily Graphic suggested that some\nof the speeches were the bitterest\nsatires ever written by WS Gilbert.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw was at the first\nperformance and wrote \"..I enjoyed\nthe score of Utopia more than that\nof any of the previous Savoy\nOperas...\"\nThe penultimate production of the great\nGilbert and Sullivan collaboration\n\" Utopia Limited\", presents something of\nan enigma. Although fairly successful at\nits first appearances it very rapidly\nachieved an obscurity rival led only by\n\" The Grand Duke\", the final G&S production.\nAs may be seen from the comments of\nthe press at the time, \" Utopia Limited\" started life amid much acclaim from\npublic and critics a like. Although it did\nno' b'a akan v of the records set by\n\u2022previous Savoy Operas, it opened on 7th October 1893 and ran for 245 performances\nThe production was eagerly anticipated\nby the London audiences and Richard\nD 'Oyly Carte lavished a mammoth \u00a37,200\non the production, an amount unprecedented\nin the history of Gilbert and Sullivan\noperas; the audiences were not disappointed\nwith what they heard. When the show\nfinally closed it began a headlong rush\ninto obscurity. It received no professional\nperformances in this country until very\nrecently. It is not,and has not been, in\nthe repertoire of any professional opera\ncompany, nor is it likely that it will be\nin the near future.\nIt is not easy to pin down the reason\nfor the lack of interest in this opera.\nIt has been suggested that its failure\ncould be due to the 'fact' that the old\nflair of the partnership was waning\nor that Gilbert' s satire was too bitter\nand aimed at too many targets at once.\nOr it may just be that the expense of a modem stage production and the necessity\nof assembling a cast of stars capable of\ndoing justice to both words and music\nmilitates against a full professional\nrevival. All the difficulties which present\nthemselves are essentially practical in\nnature and are by no means insurmountable.\nThere is a great deal in this opera which\nis worthy of note, Sullivan was fairly\nfresh and prepared to put extra effort\ninto his light opera composing in view\nof his recent successes in the field of\nmore serious composition such as a Royal Command Performance of his\noratorio . \" The Golden Legend\". During\nthe composition of \" Utopia\" he wrote his\nImperial March and conducted it at the\nopening of the Imperial Institute, South\nKensington in 1893. Gilbert aims his\nsatirical darts at the Victorian world in\ngeneral in an all out attack on English society, his particular targets include:\nBritish business methods, the Law, the\nParliamentary system, stage censorship,\nthe armed services, the Victorian Eng dish Lady and, most particularly, the English nation's opinion of itself.\nWhatever the difficulties involved, IC\nOperatic society have decided that\n\" Utopia Limited\" is well worth another\npublic airing and will be performing it in\nthe Union Concert Hall on 1 0 - 1 4 th February 1976. Tickets Available Shortly.\nThe Atlanta Rhythm Section \u2014 Dog\nDays( Polydor)\nTHE ATLANTIC RHYTHM SECTION are\na bunch of Southern session musicians\nwho decided to emerge from the VU meters\nand volume Faders to present the world\nwith yet another album of session music\nand mediocrity, a sorry mistake.\nAs you might well expect, they\nboogie, 8-bar the blues to death, jam, get\ndown, \" kick as s\", and get it on with some\nright funky country hoe-down. Who\ndoesn't these days? And all very commendably professional. Professional to a fault in fact, because the music has\nbeen drained of the slightest originality,\nno doubt of legacy of those countless\nhours of bored takes and more bored\nre-takes.\nSome sparse pleasant moments appear\nwhen the ballads come around, but the\nwhole thing is so unexceptional and\nblatantly ordinary that session musicians\nthey are surely going to remain. Technical proficiency will see you through someone\nelse' s number most times but you need\nreal talent to write an org in al song,\nand the one's on display here are about\nas innovative as Coronation Street,\nendless' rehashes of what has gone\nbefore many times.\nNo, the pre sc en ce of this album in\nthe grand scheme of things musical will not be burning fiery holes in many\npockets. \"\nRough Diamonds\nJack The Lad( Charisma)\nTHIS IS A bit more like it. Personally I don't listen to much folk music, but\nJack the lad are a different and interesting\nband whose songs concentrate on the\nworking-class life around Tyneside.

If you\nappreciate the traditional branch of folk,\nboth in it's own right and within a more\nmodern musical setting la la Fairport\nConvention or Steeleye Span) then Jack the Lad's reels, and folk-rock approx i matt or is should prove enjoyable.\nThe music is straightforward good-time\nstuff; what you might hear coming from a good country pub late at night once\nsufficient ale has been sent on it's way.\nOn the whole a reasonable album if you\npartake now and then from the folk\nbarrel,. ^\n\n"

I was\ntrying to shrug off this preconception\nlast Wednesday as I queued for registration,\nwhen suddenly a fat, bearded, socialist, white rabbit came running past with\nshouts of \" Oh my whiskers, I'm late\". The rabbit then disappeared into the\nbar towing a heavy length of broad left\nline behind him. After such a start, I wondered what the rest of the conference\nmight hold in store.\nThe conference was opened by the\nNUS's en amour ed president, Charles Clarke, who spoke mostly on the subject\nof Education Cuts and urged for a united\nfront of all students and unions against\nthese cuts \u2014 and informed us that the\nUniversities' sector of the NUS must be\ncentral to all fights (perhaps because\nwe put in the most money). He finally\nurged us to continue the fight on all\nfronts against the economic policies of\nthis right wing Labour government.\n(It is worth poi ning out here that, in\nStudent politics, anyone further left\nthan the Tribune group is considered\nleft wing and are said to belong to the\nBroad Left \u2014 a somewhat nebulous title.)\nThe Universities conference has no\npower to make policy on matters not\ndirectly concerning universities and\nthis naturally led to an argument over\nthe agenda. Of the five plenary sessions arranged, only two were of direct concern\nto universities. The first of these was on\nthe Education Cuts. The future?\nIN THE NEAR future you may all be asked\nto decide whether or not to stay in the\nNUS. This is a very serious decision, and, while it may not always seem so, I would not be in favour of our withdrawing.\nI would agree that, at the moment, the\nNUS is too involved in international\naffairs (where it su cee ds only in\nshowing its impotence). While, on the\nsubject of Northern Ireland, and the\nproblems of students at home, where NUS has real power, it remains relatively\ninert. The only way to change this\nstate of affairs is to look beyond the ends\nof your pens for once; not as far as\nChile, maybe, but just far enough to see\nyour own Students Union. Give more\nthought to the election of your representatives at conference and to the\nelection of officers. The strength of\nrepresentative democracy lies in the'\nthoughts of the active reflecting the\nthoughts of the majority. If the majority\nis apathetic, it can never work.\nPGs-time to take\nyour head out\nof the teapot.\nTHE DISCUSSION group on Postgraduates\ncentred around the problem found throughout the country by most student unions:\nthat of contacting PG' s and getting them\nto participate in the union. The converse\nis how to find ways of making the unions\nmore responsive to the needs of post-graduates.\nThe initiative in these matters must\ncome from the union. Because of the\nnature of their work, PG' s do not use\nany com muni al areas to the same extent\nthat undergraduates do. Consequently, it\nis difficult to notify them of events and\nmeetings. To the majority of post-grads,\nthe unions seem very UG orientated,\nespecially since they are active for\nonly 30 weeks of the year. At Southampton,\na scheme to integrate post grads into the\nunion by providing films, discos, etc\nduring the UG vac s proved most successful. The events, organised in the main by\nPG s already active in the union, received\nan excellent response. I feel that this\nmight be equally successful at IC,\nespecially since many UG s stay up\nduring the vac s now.\nThe best way to promote aPG organisation is at the departmental\nlevel, which most suits the PG course.\nDepartmental groups, each sending\nrepresentatives to a central committee\nis a system proved successful in many\nUniversities. There was some discussion on the PG Education reports, recently\nreleased, and the NU SPG advisory\ngroup is to look into them further.\nPG s should consider the reports and\nvoice their opinions to the bodies\nconcerned. The situation between trades\nunions and Postgraduates is changing;\nin the past, AS TUS has been regarded as\nthe only union which represents PG s, especially with respect to demonstration\nrates, which have a direct bearing on\nAS TUS agreements for their won staff -members. The AUT, long looked upon as\nelitist organisation of higher academics,\nawaits the result of a members ballot to\ndecide whether or not they will apply\nfor membership of the TUC. Both\norganisations have a postgraduate class of membership, the AUT open only to those\nPG s directly involved in teaching. There\nare definite advantages to be gained\nfrom membership of one of these unions,\nbut it would be unfortunate if a result\nof having two unions recruiting members\nwas a split amongst PG s, worse still if\nit severed them from their Student Union. It is very important that Student Unions\nand their PG s get together and sort out\ntheir differences. In the future, they\nshould be able to work together, and\nPG s should be able to make full use of\nthe Union facilities( it was suggested,\nthat if these facilities were offered for\n52, not just 30, weeks a year, the Union\nmight have a case for asking a higher\ncapita tion fee).\nIf you would like help or advice on\nhow to set up a postgraduate group in\nyour own department, or have any ideas\non how the union might be more responsive\nto PG s, please contact myself, or any\nmembers of the exec.\nJust going\nthrough the\nmotions\nMany of the motions passed at the\nconference went through uneventfully.\nThe IC delegation put through an\nemergency motion calling for the release\nof a17 \u2014page dossier supposed to\ncontain the truth on the state of the\nworld which the NUS has penned its name\nto on behalf of all British students. The motion was overwhelmingly carried. A motion fees called for the reduction\nof all fees \u2014 it is unfair and unreasonable\nto put the cost of education of LEA's rather than finding it centrally from the\nGovernment. It .penal is es those students\nforced to finance themselves. The abolition of the differential between home\nand overseas students fees was also called for.\nOthers motions passed included those\non sport, catering and postgraduates\n(table by IC). On sport, abolition of the\nbinary system was the main point, but\nthe need for severe changes in the\nassessment systems and a thorough\ninvestigation of present competitive\nassessments as to their viability and\n-reliability.\nThe motion on catering was only\npassed after sections of it concerning\nmaintenance of the UGC self balancing\nrules were removed. Our ew n belief\nis that a fair grant is the only real\nsolution and that sub sidi sing select sectors of the student body is both\nunrealistic and unfair.\nThe matter of representation was also discussed and the Executive are to\npress the CVC P for greater representation,\nespecially at departmental levels on\ncourse boards, teaching committees, etc. Our own motion on PG s had minor\namendments put to it on its passage. It\nwas the view of the conference that\nthe PG grant should be maintained at\n52/30th s of the UG grant.\nPaint the roses red\nand bloodied hands\nlilly white\nTHE TROOPS OUT CAMPAIGN were\nseverely criticised during the session on. Northern Ireland for advocating a solution 'that would inevitably end in a blood bath. The British Government did\nnot escape unscathed.\nWestminster was attacked for\n\" shrouding its Northern Ireland bloodied\nhands in lilly white gloves of innocence\" to port est to the United Nations about\natrocities in Chile while committing\nsimilar atrocities itself in Northern\nIreland.\nMadge Henderson, a member of the\nNorthern Ireland Civil Rights Association( NIC RA), leading the session delivered\n\n"

    "content": "mix3 The Grants/Cuts Campaign\n-a touch of realism needed\nSOMEONE, somewhere is\nbeing squeezed. This year, the\nannual grants review, is pressing not only for a33% increase\nin grants, but also for the\nabolition of the means test,\ndiscretionary awards, as well\nas resisting all cut backs in\neducation spending.\nSimultaneously, the Govern ment is urging local authorities\nto pare their spending on\nuniversities, polytechnics, colleges of education and so on down the line. How can\nthese two viewpoints be\nreconciled? \u2014 They cannot.\nThe education system, if it\nis to be cut, will be cut at its\nweakest and most vu ner able point. Colleges of Education\ngenerally have no independent\nfunding and produce teachers,\nthe vast majority of whom will work in state schools. The\nnumber of teacher training\nplaces is to be cut from 114,000\nto 60,000 by 1981. Fourteen\n(14) Colleges of Education\nare due to be closed or merged\nwith other institutions. The\ncutback is most drastic in the\nmost easily regulated professions.\nIn universities and polytechnics the thrift erase will most likely cause the closure\nof under-subscribed courses. As they are mainly science and engineering courses, this\ncould easily be a false\neconomy.\nThe NUS is obviously\nopposed to cut-backs, but are\nthey likely to influence the\nGovernment or anyone else by what appears to be an\nhysterical reaction? Or are\nthey merely \" Aiming for the\nmoon and hoping to hit Everest'', to misquote Harold Wilson. Statements made by the\nNUS may seem \"unrepresentative\" to university students,\nbut the NUS has over 750,000\nmembers of which only 263,242\nare full-time university\nstudents. It is hardly surprising\nthen, that the NUS reacts so\nstrongly to reductions in\nspending in institutions other\nthan universities, as two-thirds\nof Its membership come from\nthese same institutions.\nHowever, though the\nNational Union should oppose\nthe removal of discretionary\ngrants and other penny pinching measures, it seems to\nbe unrealistic to expect or\neven hope to stop every single\nbudget in education. Surely'the\nNUS would benefit its members\nmore by accepting that some\ncuts have to be made, even\nsome colleges closed, and\nadvising the Department of\nEducation and Science which\ncould be closed with least\neffect.\nTaking an implacable stand\non a motorway is not a good\nidea, some of the cuts may be\nreally damaging but blanket\nopposition will not pinpoint\nthem.\nThe demonstration on\nFebruary 27th will gain\npublicity for the grants claim, but reasoned discussions with\nthe DES might prevent damaging\ncuts. You pays yer money and\nyou takes yer choice. Jewish Society\nSo what does the IC Jewish Society do?\nIt tries to concern itself\nwith all elements of Jewish affairs which are of interest \u2014\nor what the committee of the\nday thinks should be of\ninterest! \u2014 to Jews and non-Jews\na like. To further this aim we always have a series of lectures, and\nthese are held on Tuesday or\nThursday lunchtimes so that\nyou, the average interested\nand wide-awake student can\neasily come along.\nWe have concerned ourselves\nwith aspects of the religion,\nfor example we had a lecture on\n\" Exorcism and Judaism\".\" We have been proud about how\nfar-flung the Jewish communities\nare with a talk about the\nJews in India, and we have\nworried about the problem of the\nimportance of Jews living in\nor out of Israel, and the\nthreats to the continued\nexistence of that country. We\nhave tired to illuminate\nhistory by looking at the\nBritish role in Palestine, and\nto reconsider history by\npresenting a Jewish view of\nJesus. Most recently we focussed\nour attentions on an old, but\nonly relatively recently\ndrama tis ed problem, namely\nthat of the survival of the\nJewish community in the\nSoviet Union. We were fortunate\nin being able to welcome as\nspeaker Alexander Levi ch, son of Professor Benjamin\nLevi ch, member of the Soviet\nAcademy of Sciences. Both had applied for exit\nvisas to go to Israel more than\ntwo years ago, and of course\nimmediately lost their means\nof livelihood. Alexander\nfinally was allowed to come\nto the West in April 1975,\nbut the KGB have retained\nhis father for an indefinite\nperiod, despite promises to\nthe contrary.\nWe also have social gatherings of various i in ds, so:\nDo look out for our posters\n(or become a member!) and of\ncourse come along and listen\nand argue.\nYou never know, you might\nlearn something. We might\nlearn something too.\nDori Schmetterling\nElk ie Brooks one of rocks most tenacious female vocalists gives her debut concert with a new band at IC tomorrow.\nHer debut album, Rich Man's Woman, is reviewed on page 9.\ntitbits m NINETEEN DAYS into the Sex Discrimination Act and so far\nnothing has been heard from ICWA, IC's prima donna of sexism. No wind of revolutionary change has yet reached the FELIX office; it seems unlikely that the admission doors will be flung\nopen to the hoards of young men valiantly knocking on IC WA's door.\nSeriously though, the Act presents an opportunity to look at\nthe role of ICWA. Every woman student at IC is a member of\nICWA. The organisation welcomes fresher s at the tea reception\non the first day of term and at fresher s fair the day after.\nIt's annual Freshers Dinner a week later is the best social event of the first three weeks. This year their Halloween Ball was sorely missed, but the successful Christmas buffet partially\nmade up for it. The ICWA Easter Ball completes their social functions. In the last year the Women In Science and the Women\nIn Action Group have emerged from ICWA.\nA test of any society s credibility is its'members' views./ don't want to be in ICWA, is a strangely recurrent statement\ncoming from a disturbing proportion of IC women. ICU could do\nwithout ICWA & ICWA's discriminatory are two more well conned\nphrases. Certainly a sizeable chunk of IC women regard ICWA\nas sexually divisive; a perpetual monument to the IC sex ratio.:\nThey 'eel it worsens attempts to overcome the ratio problem; in\nshort they view ICWA as an unnecessary social luxury that IC\nUnion could well do without.\nIf ICWA is just a social off shoot of ICU why does it need to\nmasquerade under a discriminatory image? After all the CC U's are\ndesigned to be IC's social unions.\nHowever ICWA, or rather the IC Women In Action Group\n(ICWIA), see the CC Us in a different light. Here' s what they\nhave to say in an article, intended for publication in Sennet, a copy of which turned up at the FELIX office late last term.\nMany of us at Imperial College are sickened by the childish\ndrunken, mi sgy nist behaviour of the three constituent college\nunions here. These unions actively work to perpetuate the female\nhating, rugby playing, public school brand of hoo ligni sm that is\nrampant every evening. They produce weekly new sheets which\nare regularly used to insult and abuse women both individually\nand collectively \u2014 usually concluding that all women are morons.\nVery adult indeed! Tnree more quotes from the same article\nillustrate the picture of IC painted by ICWIA:\n\"Slavery for Women\" badges abound-some worn by women.\nContinued on back page\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n( Letter to t&i EAlcr )\nDisaffiliation: Mr Everett's statements misleading\nSir, \u2014 Admirable though it was\nin its attempt to discuss the\nissue of NUS membership,\nMr Dermot Everett' s article\nin FELIX No.406 contained a number of misleading statements.\nFormost amongst these was the\nstatement 'Before Imperial\nCollege last joined NUS It\nboasted an admirable travel\nservice of it's own'.\nThis may be true, but it\nis very misleading to suggest\nthat an equally good travel\nservice could be set up almost\nover night in the event o*d' s a ff ili at' on; it would also require the services of at least one full-time administrator\nwhose salary etc would largely\ncounteract the saving of the\n\u00a34000 per annum which ICU\npresently pays to NUS in\na ff ili at 'on tees. His second serious error\nis to state that the voice of\n4072 students at Imperial\nCollege will carry more\nweight with the establishment\nthan the collective voice of\n771,258 students on such\nmatters as grants and education\npolicy. It is true that the\npolitics of the leadership of\nNUS are far divorced from\nthat of the grass-roots student,\nbut at least in educational\nareas they do reflect the\nopinions of the majority\nof students.\nHe also states that 'legal\nand _Jinan cia l advice to\nStudent Unions' is provided\nbut omits to mention the Legal\nAid Fund which specifically assists students financially if\nthey have the misfortune to be\nbrought to court, in connection\nwith student activities. Does he propose that an 'independant'\nICU does the same?\nFinally, may I add that, in\nmy opinion, we should remain\nmembers of NUS and by whatever\nmeans at our disposal try to\nmake NUS politically more\nrepresentative and as a first\nstep towards that goal to\npress for the introduction of\ndirect elections to the NUS executive.\nYours sincerely\nHUGH BARRETT Pli y st cs1 Sir, \u2014 I was very distressed\nto see such an inaccurate\nbiased view put forward by\nMr Everett in his two articles\n\"The Question of Disaffiliation\"\nand \"External Eclairs\"\nprinted' in the last edition ot\nFELIX. Why Mr Everett feels he is\nan authority on the \" pros\" as\nwell as the \" cons\" of af filli ation is hard to see, especially when\nvirtually ail points listed are\n\" cons\". IC may have had its\nown travel service before\nApathy a real problem\nSir, \u2014 May I take this opportunity\nto make a few comments as\nregards Ms Gadd' s article\n\" Apathy or misdirected\nslothfulness\" which appeared\n>n the last issue of FELIX. I find the whole laissez faire attitude of the article\nsomewhat surprising, especially as the writer has been one of\nthe most vociferous campaigners\nfor change in certain areas\nrecently. Indeed, I am sure\nthat the whole argument was more than a little tongue-in-cheek.\nFirstly, we must accept the\npolitical indifference of a majority of our students. I am\nnot saying that we do not all\nvote every now and again.\nI think it likely that many of\nus do.\nHowever, political awareness\ngoes deeper than the five-year\nrash known as a General\nElection, and most students\ndo not appear to care whether\nwe, as an intelligent group of\npeople, have a concensus view on many political issues, for example, ij cation cuts, the situation in Angola, etc. Whether you regard this as important is a different question. I personally find it disturbing\nthat a forum for debate for\nsuch topics appears to attract\nonly a very small number of\nstudents.\nAs for her assertion that\n\" the average IC student has\nwide and varied interests\", I would like to know from\nwhence she draws her\nstatistics. It is certainly so\nmuch moonshine to point to\nthe College bars and trie\nCC Us and to say \" look at a ii those students\", because e Ms Gadd knows, it is often\nthe same people who use the\nbars and the CC Us. It is difficult to guess how\nmany students use Union\nclubs or the Sports Centre.\nWhilst many do, I feel it is a shade optimistic to suggest\nthat the situation cannot be\nimproved.\nIn conclusion, may I point\nout that a Union Working\nParty is currently investigating\njust this field. Does the\nUnion have a problem? I await any replies with interest.\nYours sincerely, JOHN DOWNS\nHon Sec ICU\nwe joined US, bu' we would\nnot have one if we d is a ff il ii a ted. It will take a long time to set\nup such a service if it is\npossible at all, which is very\ndoubtful in the economic\nco mate of today. Who would\nrun it, perhaps Mr Everett is\nvolunteering.\nHe also claims we never\nuse the legal and financial\nservices provided by NUS. This is totally inaccurate.\nMany times last year I referred students to their\nlegal centre and rarely did a week go by without me ringing\nup NUS asking for some\nadvice on information on a wide range of subjects. \u2022 Even this year when representing the\nUnion on the Welfare group at\nthe UGC visitation in October\nI obtained some very useful\ninformation from NUS head-quarters. I suggest that if\nMr Everett used their sources, his information might be a little more accurate.\nIt seems to me that the\noption we have to take is the\none he did not include, namely,\nto continue supporting the\npolicies with which we agree\nand trying to change the ones\nwith which we do not agree;\nto involve more \" ordinary\" Students in NUS and not to\nput them off the National\nUnion by distorting the truth,\nand to encourage all students\nto make use of the services offered to them, to\nI agree that much of what is\ndiscussed at National Conference seems irrelevant,\nand much is irrelevant. How ever, every member of a delegation can learn a great\ndeal about students, about\nNUS and about debating\nprocedure (and even constitutional\nwangles) by sitting through\nsuch a conference. I think\neven Mr Everett would agree\nthat it is impossible to\nsummer ize a conference\nlasting 3 days with more than\n12 hours of discussion each\nday.\nAlthough I did not attend\nthis conference, I would\nbe very surprised if there was\nnot discussion on a lot of\nrelevant detail that were not\nmentioned in the summary. If\nno relevant matters were\ndiscussed it is the fault of\neach individual union, who\nput forward the motions, and\ndecide which of the many\nsubmitted motions should be\ndiscussed. I believe that Mr Everett\nwith his slogans and all, is\ngetting just as boring and\nmisleading as many members\nof left-wing organisations.\nYours sincerely, J A GERRARD Hon. Sec.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nComments and observations on the conference by Rick Parker\na forceful speech detailing the history of\nNorthern Ireland at the hands of the-British Government. She called for the\nintroduction of a Bill of Rights in\nNorthern Ireland as a first step towards\na solution. TheN US was asked to flex\nits political muscles nearer home, \" it is time students (Dut their own house in\norder\". The absolute silence at the\nend of the speech pointed to the generally\nacknowledged fact that the question of\nNorthern Ireland was an em baras sing one which students and indeed most\nBritons fought shy of. The atrocities being\ncommitted were only being paid lip service\nto \u2014 a change of attitude was required.\nThe third session on ' Trade Unions and the Education Cuts', was lead by\nJim Mi line, Secretary to the Scottish\nTUC was most disappointing. We were\nurged once again to fight the Tory policies of this Labour Government otherwise it\nwas a gross overstatement of the obvious\nand ended with assurances that bridges\nwere being built between the unions and\nstudents (one wonders if the traffic\nwill be two-way).\nThe International session was apart from its relative irrelevance to the\nuniversities sector, superbly uninformative.\nThe major part of it was devoted to the\nhistory of the Anti-Apartheid Movement\n(AAM) in and outside South Africa. This was followed by a rundown on the other\ninternational campaigns and the numbers\nof telegraphs of sympathy/support sent,\nwithout comment on the total impotence of\nsuch campaigns nor the disinterest of\n90% of the student population in such\ncampaigns.\nLecturer\ntraining-IC brings\nup the rear\nTHE MAIN value of this conference was\nin the discussion groups. The group on\n\" Education and Alternatives\" provided\nconsiderable information on the S CAN US( Student \"\"Community Action and Environment Unit\u2014NUS) and Counter Course\nprojects.\nBoth of these, although, relatively\nnew, have already began to investigate\nthe alternatives in education. As a result,\nvarious wide ranging courses have been\nconsidered and this year Cambridge has begun a course on women's studies. Counter Course provides alternative\nreading lists for some subjects with\naspirations of extending this facility. It\nis also considering alternative assessment\nand the setting-up of essay/ project banks within universities. The essay/ project bank idea involves\nthe storage of essays and projects for\nreference by future students engaged in\nsimilar work. It recognises the fact that\neach year a great deal of original thought\nand effort is put into project and essay\nwork. This work is usually last to\nfollowing generations of students.\nThe lecturer training group provided a great deal of information on the subject.\nThis is an area in which the greater\npart of our own college is sadly lacking.\nIt seems loath to recognise the need for\nformal training of lecturers and yet so often courses have been deemed bad due\nto poor lecturing and exam failure in a particular part of a course blamed on\nbadly delivered lectures.\nThis area is one in which IC is well\nbehind others in the country, Surrey and\nUMIST to name but two.\nDemonstration of\ninternational\nimpotence\nSUE SLIP MAN(NUS National Secretary with little responsibility\nremaining) led the plenary session on\nEducation Cuts. The session lack any\npositive direction and suffered because\nof the time allocated it \u2014 only 45 minutes.\nThe usual calls for a united struggle\nto oppose the cuts were made but no\nreal advice or suggestions were put\nforward as to how a CO C constituent\norganisation), might sur viva during their\nimplementation.\nThe cornerstone of this year's anti-cuts campaign is the national\ndemonstration on February 27th which I urge you all to attend.\nIn the second plenary session, the\nquestion of representation, at all levels\nin a university, was discussed. Student\nparticipation at all levels in decisions about their education was the firm line\nadopted. A major point that emerged from\nthis was that participation at departmental\nlevel in helping to construct courses and\nto evaluate asses ment techniques was useful to all concerned.\nThere were however, sections of the\nconference, who wished to exercise absolute veto on committee decisions without having been involved in the\ndecision making process. The idea behind\nthis being that they would avoid compromise\nsituations.\nENTS EVENTS\nElkie Brooks\nSATURDAY 17th JAN 8pm IN THE GREAT HALL\nTICKETS: 90p IC Adv.\n\u00a31.00 Adv.\n\u00a31.20 On door\nCarol Grimes\nand the LONDON BOOGIE BAND\nFRIDAY 23rd JAN\nin the Union Concert Hall\n8 pm60 p+ DISCO\n\n"
