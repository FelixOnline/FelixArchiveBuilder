The shop's range will\nthere will be a 'rolling video information service'.\nSOUTHWELL HALL\nWARDEN\nThe College invites applications for the position of\nwarden of Southwell Hall which falls vacant from\nOctober 1997. Southwell Hall in Evelyn Garens\nhouses approximately 170 students in a terrace of\nVictorian houses. It is being refurbished in two\nstages in Summer 1997 and Summer 1998.\nThe Warden will receive rent free family accommodation in return for pastoral duties within the hall, aided\nby an Assistant Warden and Subwardens.\nAny non-undergraduate member of the College may\napply but the post is particularly suitable for staff with\nsome experience of student pastoral care e.g. through tutoring or other warden ing experience, and\nwant to live in a student environment.\nFurther details and application forms can be obtained\nfrom Janet Jones, Office Services Manager, Room\n512 Sherfield Building, extension 45536.\nThe closing date for receipt of applications is 30th April 1997. It is expected that short-listed candidates\nwill be interviewed in mid-May.\ncontinued from frontpage\nacross Prince Consort Road and\nSouth along Queensgate.\nAs planned, the procession paused\nbriefly outside 170 Queensgate,\nwhere a meeting of the College's governing body was in session,\nbefore turning in towards the\nQueen's Lawn. Passing tacitly by the\nsite of the new Waterstone's Bookstore, the number of marchers\nwas swollen by students joining in\nfrom along the route.\nThe coffin was laid ceremonially\nat the foot of the Queen's Tower, and\nthe assembled company paid their\nlast respects during a few moments\nsilence. The corte ge even drew a few\ndipped safety helmets from the construction workers on the Bio-Medical\nSciences site. Robert Clarke, incoming Imperial College Union Deputy\nPresident for Finance & Services,\nthen gave a brief speech finishing on\nan optimistic note.\nThe coffin was hoisted once more,\nand carried up the stairs to the Senior\nCommon Room, past open-mouthed\ndiners and Sherfield staff. The procession received a somewhat warmer\nreception as it moved through the\nJunior Common Room, before occupying the Sherfield Walkway en\nroute to its ultimate destination.\nStudents more than filled the old\nbookstore as the coffin was laid to\nrest in the window, topped by a PHOTO: ALEX\n'Union Shop', with a vast array of\nexpand over the coming weeks, and\nhuman skull.\nThe day's events, organised by the\nUnion's Executive Committee, were\nintended more as a show of feeling\nrather than a demonstration designed\nto bring about change. Despite their\nobvious frustration and disappointment at losing the right to sell books\non campus, students leaving the\n'wake' were in good spirits and\nimmediately headed for the bar.\nLater, one member of the Committee\nexplained the significance of the\nEaster holiday to the Union: \"The\nbookstore may have been betrayed\nfor thirty pieces of silver by a Judas\nin the Sherfeld building, but on the\nthird day, when we roll the rock from\nthe front of the cave, we were confident that it would rise again - as the\nnew 'Union shop.'\"\nThe first day of the summer term\nsaw students browsing for course\ntexts among copies of The Science\nof Star Trek' beneath Waterstone's imposing new entrance beside the\nLibrary turnstiles. Meanwhile, the\nfirst day of trading at the Union's new Sherfield Walkway outlet heralded the culmination of several\nweeks' busy work by the Shop's staff\nand a hectic last weekend to complete the fit out.\nThe Shop has undergone dramatic\nrefurbishment, and expanded its\nranges of stationery, College regalia\nand other equipment.\n\n"

We started the game well\nwith Two Hands and Lt Warf combining well to inspire fear in the\nranks of Charing's defence.\nThey mounted several blitzkrieg\nattacks down the wings. The IC line\nheld firm due to good keeping from\nKiss Miss [Miss Kiss, Kiss Kiss?]\nand solid defensive play from\nHumming Bird.\nThe game now flowed freely, with\nthe IC team proving that they're a well oiled machine. Nude Girl found\nherself in front of goal thanks to the\nefforts of Two Hands and Barbie.\nNude Girl finally passed through this\nordeal to stroke the ball into the net.\nThey came back hard and were\nsoon driving into the IC \" D\" from all\nover the place. The defence of Sarah\nC, Groin Sprain and Fash the Bash\nheld out and repulsed numerous\nattacks until half-time.\nThe second half started with IC\njust holding out but it was only a matter of time before they finally\nbroke through and put the ball in the\nnet. This was a blow, but ICWHC\nare not a soft touch, especially in big\nmatches like these.\nInspired by a fighting spirit,\nHumming Bird became Fuming Bird\nas she ran round the pitch doing\nabsolutely everything. Their goal\nwas under siege - the goal had to\ncome and it duly did. At this stage\nthey were exhausted and we dominated to run out winners.\nICWHC 2 - 1 Charing Cross\nHockey thirds more\ncoherent than usual\nThings looked dod gy with Pongo\nbeing declared to poor to play for the\nteam. This meant a reshuffle was\nneeded with Turnip Man being\npushed up to fill the vacant position.\nThe game started well with an\nearly goal scoring opportunity coming after a lovely one-two between\nSpasmo and Cantfuce left\nBeekeeping For Fun And Profit\"\nwith an easy shot at goal. Sadly this\nhit the post and UCL took the opportunity to launch their own offensive.\nPlay switched to our goal mouth through some slack defending from\nThora Hird's Luminous Revolving\nPanty Liners. The score was kept 0-0\nthanks to the efforts of goalkeeper A Million Flannels Covered In\nMarmite And Thrown At A Squirrel.\nThe half ended disastrously with\ninjury forcing Uncooked Meat Prior\nTo State Vector Collapse to retire,\nreplaced by Mmmmadagascar.\nIn the second half we lost our star\nstriker Mystic Meg's All-Seeing\nCrystal Balls and they started to pressure our defence. Despite the efforts\nof captain Swirling Mist Of\nMelodious Vapours, Ever Waxing\nAnd Waning Like An Infinite Sea Of\nVelvet Covered Truffles, their\nadvantage was soon turned into\ngoals. Our only consolation was a last minute goal from Ba Bar Bar Bar\nGa Dang Ga Dang Dang Ramma\nLamma Ding Dong Blue Moon.\nICHC III 1-4 UCL Kung-fu needs you\nDo you think that all Martial Artists\nare weird psychopaths Do you think\nMartial Arts is only pra c tied by\nstrong, fast, supple males?

It's full of\ndetailed information about our particular form of Kung Fu, and lots of\nrelevant links to sites.\nIf you would like to participate in\nor observe our sessions, you are welcome to join in on Wednesdays or\nFridays 7-9pm. at Southside Gym.\nYour first lesson is free!\nChess team in girlfriend\nshock\nLast Thursday IC 2nd Chess Team,\nin Division 3 of the Middlesex\nLeague, were away at Muswell Hill.\nHaving crushed their opponents\n6.5-1.5 at the home match in\nDecember, they expected an easy\nwin. On board one, Jeremy Davies\nwhipped up a promising attack with\nblack against a much stronger player\nbut then blew it by blundering away\na knight. Gigi Desogus thwarted an\nattack on his castled king; while\nlaunching his own offensive on the\nother wing, he overlooked a fork\nfrom his opponent's knight, losing a rook and the game. Andy Slough and\nPatrick Duncan had easy wins\ndespite rustiness due to several\nmonths absence from the team.\nCaptain Barry Gale, desperately\nshort of time and seeing no hope in abed tense situation, did the only sensible\nthing - wildly counter-attacked! His\nconfused opponent is contemplating\nresignation. At the cost of a pawn\nRob Kruszynski brought his pieces\nswiftly into action with daring\nattacks on his opponent's marauding\nqueen. After three hours of complex\nman ou ve ring they were still playing.\nPaitrick's girlfriend Sonja courageously stepped in as a reserve (our\nfirst ever female player) with only\none hour of lessons! She put up a brave fight but was quickly defeated\nby an experienced opponent. Lloyd\nKilford offered an early draw (his\nusual tactic against much stronger\nop posit ion) which was refused. He\nlasted a creditable 50+ moves.\nThe score is 4 - 2 to Muswell Hill\nwith two games unfinished.\nf Kh This is from the game P Hurn vB Gale. White played Qxc7 and went\non to win. Can you spot a more decisive move he could have made?\nIC Rugby lose to St Hils\nEr yeah, fuckin' great match. At least\nI think it was, somebody jumped on\nmy head during the first scrum and I can't remember much after that.\nErm, Oh! There was this bit where\nthey scored a try right and while the\nref was watching this, psycho kicked\ntheir fly-half in the kidneys. Nice one\npsycho! Or was it Killer? Anyway it\nwas fuckin' good. Later I managed to\neat someone's ear.\nThen at half time we had our usual\nthirteen pints so things got a bit confused after that. Hey! Now Ire mem ber, it was fuckin' hilarious!\nEveryone's covered in mud right, so\nno-one can tell who the fuck anyone\nis. So anyway Skull-crusher thinks\nhe's found one of their props so he\nelbows them in the face and breaks\ntheir jaw. Turns out later it wasn't one of their's, it was Vandal.

    "content": "Planet Science\npar lier this month, New Scientist magazine relaunched\nCits world wide web site, Planet Science. The new\n'improved' look is very different, all the colourful icons that\nused to welcome you to Plane! Science have gone. In\ntheir place is an image of the front cover from the latest\nissue, and lots of text. This pared down style is reminiscent of the on-line versions of other science magazines,\nnotably New Scientist's big brothers, Nature and Science.\nTry to spot the difference opposite... However, the web\npundits at New Scientist claim t they have been slaving\nover a hot mouse for weeks, to bring their readers more\ncontent, rather than style, with lots of new features.\nSo how does Planet Science at http://www.new scientist. com compare to the web pages of other science\nmagazines? Well they all contain selected material from\ntheir respective publications, as well as special web features on hot topics, such as genetic cloning or the search\nfor life on Mars. A useful feature of all the web pages are\nsearchable jobs, courses and meetings databases, such\nas New Sc/en fe fs http://www.science jobs. com. So is\nthis an example of cloning on the internet, or does Planet\nScience now have more to offer?\nMost of the extra features of Planet Science are found\nin the new NSplus section, which has material only found\non the web. The supplementary material includes new\nsections on background reading, anything internet related (surprise, surprise) and lots of puzzles, with, for the first\ntime, explanations of how they can be solved.\nTwo new sections worth a second look are Btteback\nand Grand-Tours. Biteback is your chance to join in lively\ndiscussions that started on the New Scientist's letters\npages. Grand-tours is the first on-line travel guide to sites\nof special scientific interest. This section is also supposed\nto be animated - if you have a browser that supports\nShockwave - although they claim to be working on a version that doesn't require any plugins.\nThe best new feature of Planet Science is for anyone\nwho likes to have the Last Word. Readers of the magazine will already be familiar with the question and answer\nsection which deals with general queries from readers\nabout absolutely anything science related, such as why\neggs are egg-shaped.\nThis is an area where the internet really comes into its\nown. It is invaluable for settling family disputes. There's no\nlonger a need for heated arguments about whether the\nactress in Green Card was Andie MacDowell or Anne\nStuart Masterton. Simply fire up the nearest modem, type\nthe words 'Green Card' into a web search engine, and\nany number of homepages by movie buffs will settle the\nmatter once and for all.\nThe Last Word archive at Planet Science should\nbecome the place to look for answers to all those intriguing science and technology questions. If you've been\nwondering how those widget s in the bottom of beer cans\nwork, whether fish fart or why men have nipples, then\nwait no longer. Head straight for http://www.last-word.com.

To save your sanity,\nhere at Felix we have devised a cunning remedy for those Election Night blues (and\nreds, purples, yellows, greens, off-whites or whatever): the Felix General Election\nDrinking Game. To play, tune into the BBC's coverage of the results, grab a vat-load\nof your favourite poison (though not, of course, an actual poison - its not really going\nto be that bad) and follow the instructions below.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2 5 TH APRIL LETTERS & NOTICES 19\nLetters to Felix\nCinema goes to waste\nDear Felix,\nThe loss of the bookshop is a significant loss of funding for the\nUnion. Therefore, the Union should\nmake the best of its current assets.\nICU Cinema has a33 mm projector, a new 30ft screen and technically it is\none of the best student cinemas in the\ncountry. However, the Concert Hall\nis primarily for the use of DramSoc,\nOpSoc and other staged events. This\nmeans that the cinema can't get regular bookings.\nIf there were a separate venue, the\ncinema could not only cater for\nFilmSoc, but also SciFiSoc, the\nIndian Film Group, and other soci-e ties, as well as serving Conference\nin the holidays. Moreover, this would\ncreate substantial revenue for the\nUnion. At present FilmSoc has made\nat least \u00a35,000 this year and so far\nhas 1413 members about 100 of\nwhom are UL U staff and students not\nfr cm IC. With the redevelopment of\nBeit Quad under consideration, I feel\na more permanent venue for the cinema would prove as popular as it\nwould profitable. At present I believe\nthe cinema is clearly a wasted asset.\nJohn Wilson,\nICU Cinema Publicity\n...and while we're at it, LeoSoc\nneed a room, STOIC's studio is far\ntoo small, the Outdoor Club could\ndo with a seperate store, etc... It\nwould be lovely if they could, but\neven if there is extra space, flexibility by all will be the key...\nTough on students, tough\non the causes of students\nDear Felix,\nAt last the wait is over. For eighteen long years students have suffered under the imperialist, capitalist\nTories. Now, at long last, we the\nfuture of this country can smell\npower. No more student loans! No\nmore crumbling universities! No\nmore libraries starved of books! All\nthose demonstrations against Tory\nmisrule, the marches to Trafalgar\nSquare - the comradeship of a minority group oppressed like no other -all of that was won th it. In just one\nweek, the Labour Le.a der, our leader.\nTony 'Man of the People' Blair will\nwalk into Downing Street and begin\nthe renaissance of the masses.\nHands trembling with anticipation\nI buy a copy of the manifesto. I almost can't open it, I am shaking -1\nam shaking! Oh what bliss to be\nalive! Education - where is it - there\npage 6. 'Education our number one\npriority'. Page nine, 'Higher\nEducation'. What will the grant be?\n\u00a34000, \u00a35000 - perhaps even \u00a36000?\nNo, remember Tony's determined to\nkeep public spending down - he\nprobably settle for just five grand.\nHere it is, ''The improvement and\nexpansion needed..' Too right! At\n'em Tony! We will overcome those\nTory bastards! '...cannot be funded\nout of general taxation..' God! He's proposing a special tax - a university\nmoney-raising tax! This is good shit!\n'...Our proposals for funding...' Here\ncomes, here comes money! '...have\nbeen made to the Dearing\nCommittee, in line with success jul policies abroad..'. Successful policies abroad?\nWhat does Tone mean? In line\nwith foreign practice? Sounds good\nthough! And now.for maintenance\ngrants!. '...The costs of student maintenance should be repaid by graduates on an income-related basis,\nfrom the career success to which\nhigher education has contributed.'\nOh.\nWell.\nIt could be worse.\nIt's just not quite what I was\nexpecting.\n[Telephone Rings]\nHello. Yes that's me. You want an\nex-NUS President to stand as a Labour candidate? You want me?\nWill I do it? You bet I will! So that's meet Peter at 3:30. I 'll be there.\nThat's that then. New Labour.\nTough on students, tough on the\ncauses of students. Never forget how\nprivileged they are. Short hours,\ncheap beer, lots of sex. And in\ntoday's increasingly globalised\nworld one has to keep taxes low to\nremain competitive. We do support\nstudents, and do want them to succeed with the best possible funding.\nBut only when resources allow. We\ncannot promise what we cannot\ndeliver. Investment and training are\nthe key. Invest in people. Invest in\nstudents. Graduate loans. Tough on\nstudents, tough on crime. Tough on\nthe causes of crime. Harriet Harman.\nPeter Mandelson. Fiscal propriety.\nWhen resource allow. Investment\nand training. No tax increases.\nPrivatise, realise, social is e, no not\nthat last one. Investment and training.\nWhen resources allow...\nName and address retained\nDear Felix,\nI have just discovered that my end\nof year finals this year are to be held\nin a marquee in Prince's Gardens\ninstead of the Great Hall. I discovered this via a notice posted up in\nhalls of residence which explains that\na marquee will be erected as a venue\nfor college examinations as the Great\nHall is affected by building work. On\nreading this, I initially thought that it\nwas some kind of joke. However, I decided to check with my depart-ment. On the urgent noticeboard in\nthe department of chemistry, there\nwas a notice. A4 sized, not particularly eye catching, unsigned and\nundated. It was apparently to confirm\nletters sent to us all by registry,\ninforming us of the location change.\nHowever, as yet, no such notification\nhas been received from the registry. I wonder how many other people out\nthere will be surprised by the change\nof venue ?\nAs if this complete breakdown of\ncommunication were not bad\nenough, I am appalled that the students of one of the top four institutions in the country are forced to sit\ntheir end of year examinations in\nwhat is effectively a tent in the garden between two of their halls of res-i den ce. No matter what efforts are\nmade to control noise levels, it will\nbe impossible to silence the noise\nfrom Exhibition Road, which is\nclearly audi able from the garden.\nAnd if it rains, the sound of raindrops\non the canvas would create a distracting background noise. Are we, per-hap s, to depend on the oh-so-reliable\nBritish weather for examination-level silence ? And if so, is this not a little optimistic ?\nPersonally, I would like to see a little more regard for the needs of the\ncollege's undergraduate students,\nand I am sure that many out there\nwill agree with me. Maybe if a few\nmore people are prepared to voice\ntheir dissatisfaction things may get a little better for us.\nIf you are also affected by this, or\nthink you might be, or are just\nappalled by this disgraceful attitude,\nplease say so. Please make noise\nabout it. Email people, ring them,\npester them until they are sick of\nhearing your voice. If nobody com-plains, nothing will get done and\nabo mint a ions like this will continue.\n(Oh, and please feel free to email me:\nj. w alms ley@ ic).\nregards,\nJon Walmsley, Chemistry II\nLetters may edited for content\nor length.\nThe deadline for letters to be\npublished in the next issue of\nFelix is Tuesday 29th April.\nLetters may be e mailed to our\naddress: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPapers for nominations for the post of\nPresident are now up opposite the Union\nOffice.\nANY FULL MEMBER OF THE UNION MAY STAND FOR THE POST.

There's Danni and\nMia, a pair of lesbians who are having a shaky patch over\ncommitment to one another. There's frustrated perfectionist Alice, a post grad whose thesis on \"Doris Day as\nFeminist Warrior\" is four years late. She's looking for the\nperfect blok e who, amongst other things, must be left-handed, honest and like the same films as her. Two possible contenders are Ari, a Classics student and part-time\ngigolo and Michael, a shy medical student living with\nhousemates from hell.\nThe directorial debut for 23 year old Emma Kate\nCroghan follows a day in the life of this oddball bunch of\ncharacters: Ifs a typical student life, involving parties,\nsearching for accommodation and thinking about sex\nrather than having it. The filmmaker and her unknown\ncast are obviously just out of uni as they manage to catch\nthe campus spirit perfectly, from the bureaucratic nightmare of swapping courses to the panic of avoiding lecturers to whom you owe work.

Unable to\nraise much funding she shot the whole thing for \u00a320,000,\nless than a second's worth of a Hollywood film, and\nunfortunately it shows. Some of the filters used make the\ncolours look like something from Top of the Pops in the\n\"I 'll try anything once, except incest\nand folk-dancing.\"\nseventies. They also could have done with some help\nfrom an experienced script-writer. The dialogue is a bit\nfunctional and so the film is very short at just over an hour,\ndespite several time-filling party scenes.\nThe actors, however, do very well with the material.\nFrances O 'Connor in particular, who plays Mia, has a Jack\nNicholson-esque smile that may well be very famous one\nday. In the meantime this is harmless and charming stuff,\nbut probably not worth paying for when there are so\nmany high quality films around at the moment.\nchris\nMOONLIGHT\nBox of Moonlight is similar to one of those films i shown on morning TV during school holidays. It's a flight of fantasy where the viewer never knows\nwhat bizarre discovery or accident will next happen to the characters. They might find a pair of\nshoes that lets them see into the future or a hat\nthat makes them temporarily invisible. But by the\nend of the story, we always know everyone\nonscreen will have learnt something about life and\neverything will return to normal.\nAl (John Turturro) is the man around whom this\nparticular fable is based, an electrical engineer\napproaching something of a mid-life crisis. He is\nsupervising a construction job miles from home, but\nis the sort of chap who phones his wife twice a day,\nirons his shirt every night and goes to the toilet at the\nsame time every morning. However, one day the entire\njob is unexpectedly cancelled and everybody goes\nhome except Al. He calls his wife, tells her the job is\nstill on, and realises that for the first time in his life he\nhas no responsibilities, no deadlines and no obligations. This is when he meets 'The Kid\" (Sam\nI Rockwell), a Huck Finn type who introduces Al to a lifestyle where food is caught, washing is a dip\nin a lake and work is a four letter word.\nThe director, Tom DiCillo, manages to\nsuck the audience into this yarn. We really feel for Al when, for example, the lake\nhe once visited as a child is no longer\nswum in due to the toxic waste that has\nbeen dumped in it. However, when the film\nfinished and the predictable ending has\noccurred there is a slight sense of disappointment.\nThere are some very amusing scenes and a few\npoignant moments but they are too few and far\nbetween. John Turturro is his usual high-quality self and\nthere's nothing to dislike about the film but ifs just a bit\nlightweight. Nonetheless, ifs an easy way to while\naway Iwo hours on a rainy day.\nchris\nA Self Made Hero \u2022\nA young boy, Albert, growing up in provincial France just\nbefore WW2 spends his time pretending to be the heroes\nof the books and comics he reads. His mother also\nspends her time in fantasy, dreaming that her husband\nwas a hero in WW1 when in fact he was a drunkard.\nWhen Albert discovers that she has been lying about his\nfather to him, it shapes his perception of the world and\nhas a tremendous effect on his life. Winner of the Best\nScreenplay award at last years Cannes Film Festival, this\ngentle comedy written and directed by Jacques Audiard\nand starring Mathieu Kassovitz (who himself directed the\nacclaimed la Haine') is an absolute delight.\nOn paper the story of Albert's rapid rise through the\nFrench army seems totally unbelievable but, such is the\nstory-telling ability of Audiard and the wonderful performance of Kassovitz, you are swept along with it all the\nsame. The film is apparently a reflection on how the\nFrench view their role in the War, and how reality can be\nvery different than what we perceive it to be. The character of Albert evolves throughout the film, from the innocence of a young day-dreamer to a responsible and\nmature adult, albeit one who has used deceptive means\nto get where he is in life. When Albert's downfall comes, it\nis not because the lies he has told have been found out,\nbut because he realises that you cannot ignore the truth\nwithin yourself. This is an effective film which confidently\ncarries a powerful message that gives the audience plenty to think about.\nfilm\n\n"

The film tends to spend too little time on the interesting areas and vice versa. Plus, they vary from the\nbanal to the melodramatic and consequently often the\njuxtaposition can ruin a scene before it begins.\nThis is not to say that the film doesn't have its moments.\nA wicked sense of black humour and some realistic acting\nfrom a set of mainly unknowns helps to keep the film\nafloat, and prevents one's interest from straying too far.\nUltimately though the problem lies with the writer-dire c tor's( Kevin Allen - brother of the more famous Keith) in experience.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 25TH APRIL\nDoes British science need saving?\nTONY OFORI\nTuesday lunchtime saw representatives from the three major political\nparties gather for a debate on the\nfuture of British science. The meet-ing, held in the Mechanical\nEngineering lecture theatre in front of\nan audience largely consisting of aca-demi cs, was organised by the Save\nBritish Science Society and was\naimed at raising public awareness\nabout the current situation of science\nin this country.\nThe meeting was opened by the\nRector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, who\nintroduced the three guest speakers:\nIan Taylor, the Conservative\nMinister for Science; Adam Ingram,\nhis Labour counterpart; and Lord\nEzra from the Liberal Democrats.\nThey were each allowed five minutes\nat the beginning to express their\nviews, where Mr Taylor stated that\nthe performance record for science in\nBritain was good and the three main\ndisciplines of science, engineering\nand technology are \"alive and well\".\nUnsurprisingly the shadow minister\nfor Labour disagreed, claiming that\nthe Conservative party have damaged\nthe science industry which is now in\nneed of drastic improvement. Lord\nEzra concurred with Mr Ingram, but\nalso pointed out the necessity of\nheavy spending.\nAlthough this meeting was not\npacked with excitement (there were\nno fist-fights and no one threw a glass of water over anyone else),\nsome interesting points were raised.\nPHOTO: ALEX The Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, and the Labour spokesman for Science\nand Technology, Adam Ingram, in last Tuesday's debate. In the past, the\nRector has called upon alumni to make HE and science an election issue.\nTwo of the more thought-provoking\nquestions were: 'would the new government be prepared to foot the forecasted \u00a31 billion bill required to get\nBritish science back at the forefront\nof industry?'; and 'what plans are\nthere to promote science to the\nyounger generation?'. In response to\nthe former, Mr Taylor dismissed the\nfigures as misleading but added that\nsteps have been taken to get industry\nto invest more. Mr Ingram's answer\nwas that a problem does not get\nsolved by throwing money at it. For\nthe latter question, a consensus was\nreached that more had to be done, but\nthe only solution offered was to\nencourage successful scientists/engi-ne ers to make themselves known so\nthat they could act as role models.\nSome interesting statistics about\nscience in the UK were given during\nthe debate including the fact that\n\u00a3590 million of the government's total budget goes into research; the\npercentage of qualified scientists and\nengineers between 20 and 24 years\nold is greater than that of most countries including the US; and since the\nmid 1980s there has been a60% rise\nin science-based employment.\nAt the end of the debate one thing,\nat least, was clear - Britain would be\ndeficient without a firm science and\ntechnology base and if it is to stay in\ncontention with its competitors, these\nareas would have to become more of\na priority to which ever government\nis in power after the counting stops\nnext Friday morning.\nCathSoc provides Shelter for Homeless\nNEWS TEAM Shelter, the National Campaign for\nHomeless People, was the happy\nrecipient of a \u00a31,000 donation by\nICU's Catholic Society, Methodist\nSociety and the West London\nChaplaincy. The money, raised as\npart of a joint charity drive by the\nsocieties, will go to provide training\nand support for Shelter's work\nthroughout the country.\nMaria Gregoriou, a Community\nNetworks Fundraiser for Shelter,\noutlined how the money would be\nput to good use: \"We are going to\npromote policies to provide effective\nlong-term solutions for all homeless\nThe presentation of the cheque.\nCatherine Langrishe and Rob\nGregoriou, Community Networks\nTony Skillen, the College Chaplain.\npeople, not just those who sleep\nrough on London's streets.

For example, \u00a335 provides\nabed space in an emergency Shelter\nfor one week, while \u00a380 will train a caseworker in the advice skills needed to help homeless people.\nShelter receives nearly \u00a382,000 in\ndonations from schools, colleges and\nuniversities, but plan to launch a major appeal to double the number\nof individual sponsors.\nPHOTO: ALEX From left to right: Mark Wong,\nKingham from CathSoc, Maria\nFundraiser for Shelter and Father\n\n"

This action was decided\non in preference to postponing construction work, which would cost the\nCollege several hundred thousand\npounds in delays and wages.\nAfter much discussion, College\nauthorities have decided that the\nexams are going to be relocated to a \"rigid-structured temporary mar-que e\" in Prince's Gardens, with no\ntiming changes foreseen. Ian\nCaldwell, Director of the Estates\nDivision, explained: \"We felt it was\nbetter to relocate the exams rather\nthan re timetable, because students,\nstaff and examiners will be geared up\nto a specific time and date and whatever we do, we do try to minimise the\ndisruption on the College com muni ty\"\nIn a letter to all students, Soosan\nOldroyd, Assistant registrar for\nExaminations, explained the reasons\nbehind the relocation. She also urged\nstudents to \"accept the College's apologies for any inconvenience\ncaused.\" However, apologies came\ntoo little and too late for some stu-dents. \"I think that in one of the top\nfour universities [sic] in the country,\nthe fact students who are taking\nexams are being treated this way is\nabsolutely disgusting,\" said one student from Linstead Hall, \"it's a joke.\nWe deserve better.\"\nExams were relocated away from\nCivil Engineering earlier this year\ndue to the noise from the BMS build-ing, but the problem in the Great Hall\nwas not noticed until the Easter vaca-tion. This has meant that this weeks'\nexams have not been re positioned, but the work has been allowed to\n\"suffer\" instead, according to Mr\nCaldwell.\nHe went on to explain how the\nwork had been planned from the start\nto cause minimum disruption to\nexam candidates, with work in the\nnorthern section of the library being\npostponed until the holidays.\ncontinued on page two\nWake sees off Union Bookshop\nNEWSTEAM\nThe last day of term before the\nEaster vacation saw around fifty\nImperial College students attend a mock funeral procession intended to\nmark the 'death' of Imperial College\nUnion's bookstore, the contract to\nsupply academic texts on campus\nhaving been previously awarded to\nbooksellers Waterstone's.

    "content": "16 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 2 5 TH APRIL\nBefore we get down to business, I must deal with young Benjamin\nWeir and his rather amusing letter\nlast term, in which he accused me of\nbeing a fascist and Felix of being\npolitically biased. Though his year\nand department were omitted from\nhis contribution, it is abundantly\nclear that he is a12 year old prodigy\nin the Maths Department- can differentiate with the best of them, but is\ncursed with a Ruth Lawrence-esque\nnaivet e about the real world. For the\nsake of young Mr Weir, 1 shall make\ntwo points. Firstly, the political complexion of a newspaper is set by its\neditorial, not its opinion writers; for\nexample Harry Enfield, self-con-fess ed 'Bollinger Bolshevik' now\nwrites for the Sunday Telegraph.\nSecondly, there is no surer way to\nundermine an argument than the\ncareless use of emotive words such\nas fascist. Better luck next time, son.\nOn May 1st, this country is faced\nwith one of the most important decisions of our lifetime. We, by common consent, have one of the most\ndynamic economies in the world and\nimproving general prosperity and\nliving standards. We are also on the\nverge of a potentially huge sea-change in Europe, centered around\nmonetary union. The choice is\nwhether we stick with the party that\ngave us the current economic conditions or change. In that most British\nof ways, do we 'give the other lot a chance'?\nIt would be churlish and incorrect of\nme to suggest that Labour have not\nchanged. Or rather, the Labour leadership has changed. Gone is Clause\n4 and the calls for re-nationalisation\nhave changed to an embrace of pri-vat is ation. Calls\nfor withdrawal\nfrom Europe\nwith the slogan\n'Out of Europe,\ninto the world'\nin the 1975 referendum campaign have\nbeen replaced\nby a desire to\nerode the veto\nand adopt the\nSocial Chapter.\nPolicy pledges\nhave indeed\nchanged out of\nall recognition,\nbut one must\nask why and to\nwhat extent\ndoes this shift\nrepresent the\nviews of the\nwhole party. In\nthe light of four\npolicy U turns\nfive days after the publication of a manifesto that took three years to\nwrite, electoral expediency rather\nthan convictions seems a fair inter-preta tion. People say that the Tories\nand Labour are the same these days.\nThere are certainly large areas where\nLabour appear to have, if not stolen\nthe clothes, at least swiped the dressmaking patterns. Don't look at the\npolicy overlap, look at the differ-Simon Baker\nthe rea\ncand\nLabour have a number of key, potentially disastrous policies.\nFirst and foremost must be\nthe minimum\nwage. Even\nJohn Prescott\nhas been\nforced to admit\nthat this will\nlead to job\nlosses, though\nhe didn't suggest how\nmany. Aside\nfrom the initial\nlosses caused\nby staff cuts,\nthe long term\neffects on\nBritain's competitiveness\nare far more\nserious.\nLabour will\ncounter this\nwith the old\n'sweat-shop economy' argument,\nbut this is frankly rubbish. Average\nannual take-home pay in the UK is\n\u00a3400 lower than Germany and about\n\u00a31,500 higher than France. Note\ntake-home pay rather than straight\nwages, this being due to the far lower\ntax burdens on employers and\nson able i date employees here. Which brings us\nconveniently to the Social Chapter.\nMake no mistake, the reason that\nBritain attracts more inward investment than Germany and France\ncombined is that the costs of\nemploying someone here are less\nthan half that in some of our\nEuropean partners. Where the US\nhave created millions of jobs over\nthe last decade, Europe has managed\nto lay off about 15 million people by\na range of policies designed not to\ncreate jobs, but to stave off unemployment, with little success. Labour\nare keen to sign up to the regulator's charter, displaying all the worst\nexcesses of big government and state\ncontrol. Steering clear of the disaster\nthat is monetary union won't stop\nToyota investing here, huge additional costs will.\nI could go on, but space does not per-mit. Reading the Labour manifesto,\none finds grand sound bites by the\ncart load dramatically improving\neducation (cutting \u00a3180 million from\nthe assisted places scheme), rebuilding the NHS by cutting admin (sav-ing 0.3% of the budget) and so on.\nThe Conservatives, surprisingly it\nmust be said, have proposed some\ngenuinely radical policies- privatisation of state pensions, transfer of tax\nallowances from un working spouses\nto their working partners and reducing business rates for small business-es. Ladies and gentlemen, it's over to\nyou.\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nA letter in the last edition of Felix\nraised some interesting questions\nabout political bias in this new spa per, accusing my fellow columnist\nand I of partisan reporting, and hoping we'd all be gagged in the run-up\nto the election in six days time (I guess it didn't have the desired\neffect). Imperial College Union, of\nwhich this paper is a part of, has\ncharitable status like most other student unions and cannot therefore\nsanction any political creed or party\nwithout jeo pardi sing its charitable\nstatus.\nAll this means in practice is that\nthe entire editorial content of the\npaper must not be in support of a particular party, and headlines such as\n'Everyone vote for X' would get\neveryone into trouble.\nMany people have asked me who\nI'm going to vote for, where I stand\nin it all, and even who they should\nvote for. Well, vote for whoever the\nhell you want! Anyone who has the\nbrains to study at Imperial should\nsensibly make up their mind as to\nwho they want to run the country for\nfive years.\nThe only big recommendation I would make is that you do vote,\nbecause if you abstain on the\ngrounds that 'it wouldn't make any\ndifference anyway' then you should-n't complain when a party you dislike comes into power. Those who\ndo not vote have no voice. Party\nstrategists, when deciding policy,\ntake into account the fraction of\naffected areas of the population who\nturn out to vote. If particularly few of\nthem turn out each election, they will\nbe a 'soft spot' for unpleasant legislation which gains them votes with\npeople who do turn out to vote.\nCampaigns such as 'Rock the vote'\nare trying to increase the influence of\nthe younger generation by making\nthem turn out to vote. If there is an\nincrease this election of young people voting, the mainstream parties\nwill be pressured to re-jig their policies to keep the young behind them.\nThe state of higher education and the\ncontinual assault on student's wallets\ndemonstrate the paucity of the student vote.\nIf you are voting in the Cites of\nLondon and Westminster const it u en cy, it may be wise to read last term's interview with the main candidates,\nPeter Brooke, Kate Green and Mike\nDumigan. The vote you make will be\nfor a particular person to represent\nyou and this geographic area in\nParliament, as well as giving a party\nan extra vote in the passing of Bills\nthrough the Commons. There are\nmany people who dislike a party but\nlike their candidate enough to vote\nfor him/her despite his/her alle-gian ce, and vice-versa. Do take care\nof your vote as this is probably your\nlast one until 2002, when most of\nyou will have graduated, and could\nwell working full-time with a mortgage and family!\nFinally, a number of people\nincluding a certain other nameless\nFelix columnist and the person writing the 'political bias' letter seem to\nthink I write under a pseudonym.\nWell I don't.I actually live with this\nname, thank you. And remember to\nvote on the 1 st of May.\nThe real, live and kicking Hamish\nCommon's Westminster Eye will be\nappearing intermittently over the\nnext few weeks due to exams.\n\n"
