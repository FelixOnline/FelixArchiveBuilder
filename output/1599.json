Research conducted\nat the University of Portsmouth has\nrevealed that the teeth of these small\naquatic creatures are so strong they\ncould be copied to make the cars,\nplanes and boats of the future.\nA team of researchers at the\nUniversity\u2019s School of Engineering\ndiscovered that limpet teeth contain\nGoethite, a hard mineral made up of\nfibrous structures. Together these\nfibres create a material that rivals the\nstrength of even the toughest manmade fibres. Limpets rely on their\nhigh strength teeth for scraping rock\nsurfaces to collect algae to feed on.\nDesigning materials based on\nwhat we see in nature is known\nas \u2018bioinspiration\u2019. Until now,\nspider silk was thought to be the\nstrongest biological material, with\na variety of potential applications\nfrom bulletproof vests to computer\nelectronics.\nProfessor Asa Barber, who led the\nresearch, said: \u201cNature is a wonderful\nsource of inspiration for structures\nthat have excellent mechanical\nproperties. All the things we observe\naround us, such as trees, the shells\nof sea creatures and the limpet teeth\nstudied in this work, have evolved to\nbe effective at what they do.\u201d\nReplications of limpet teeth\nmay be used in the future for high\nperformance engineering of Formula\n1 cars, boat hulls and aircraft\nstructures.\n\u201cEngineers are always interested\nin making these structures stronger\nto improve their performance or\nlighter so they use less material\u2026but\nwith so many biological structures to\nconsider, it can take time to discover\nwhich may be useful.\u201d\nBarber\u2019s team tested a piece of\nlimpet tooth almost 100 times\nthinner than the diameter of a\nhuman hair. A technique called\natomic force microscopy was used to\npull apart the material down to the\nlevel of the atom and examine its\nmechanical behaviour.\nThe research also revealed that\nlimpet teeth are just as strong no\nmatter what their size.\n\u201cGenerally a bigger structure has\nlots of flaws and can break more\neasily than a smaller structure, which\nhas fewer flaws and is stronger. The\nproblem is that most structures have\nto be fairly big so they\u2019re weaker than\nwe would like. Limpet teeth break\nthis rule as their strength is the same\nAnyone who\u2019s ever been to\na primary school music\nrecital may well have got\nthe impression that the recorder is a\nrather simple instrument.\nThe physics behind it, however, is\nincredibly complicated.\nUsing a powerful supercomputer\nrunning for two weeks, a group led by\nHiroshi Yokoyama from Toyohashi\nUniversity of Technology in Japan\nhave determined the complex nature\nof the sound field around a recorder\nand other air reed instruments for the\nvery first time.\nWhen the musician bows into an air\nreed instrument, standing waves are\ncreated within the tube, causing it to\nresonate.\nCovering and uncovering\nholes changes the wavelengths\nthe instrument will resonate at,\nproducing different pitched notes.\nA recorder contains a small slit just\nbelow the mouthpiece called the knife\nedge, which splits the airflow going in\nand out of the recorder.\nThis creates highly nonlinear\neffects, forming turbulent vortices,\nwhich are extremely chaotic, and\nrequire huge computing power to\nmodel accurately.\nUsing computational fluid\ndynamics techniques, the team\ndetermined how this behaviour\ncreates pressure waves that emanate\nfrom the instrument.\nImportantly, they also predicted\nhow the sound propagates through\nthe air, forming a far-field pattern\nthat is heard by the audience.\nThe work was presented at an\nannual conference on noise control\nengineering in Melbourne, Australia.\nThe research was done in\ncollaboration with instrument\nmakers Yamaha, who hope this new\nunderstanding could help them to\ndesign instruments with a better\nsound quality.

The\nnext challenge for researchers is to\nwork out how limpet teeth can be\nreplicated in the lab to allow the\nmaterial to be used in engineering.\nDOI: 0.1146/annurev.\nmatsci.28.1.271\n\n"

Now we\u2019ve got to know Rob and Sharon\n(played by Rob and Sharon),it is impossible not to love\nthem.The humour is subtle and modern.Think of the\nfunniest person you know on Facebook: ironic and self-deprecating but also sweet and relatable.This is pretty\nmuch the style in which Catastropheis delivered.\nThe chemistry between the characters is also great,\nmostly because Sharon is the grumpy woman all women\nthink they are and Rob is the adorable man we\u2019d all want\nto have close to us.Plus it\u2019s set in lovely London Fields,\nwith Sharon and Rob often sitting at the Market Caf\u00e9,\nin Broadway Market,overlooking Regents Canal and\nsipping cappuccinos.This made me as excited as visiting\nthe Central Perk.\nA little bit of drama is thrown into the mix as Sharon\ndiscovers some pregnancy complications and the couple\ngradually learn to love and support each other.The plot\nseems simple,but the strong leading performances give\nit enough depth and personality to support the whole\nshow.\nGIULIA GABRIELLI\n\"With the\njob, the\nmoney,\nthe looks\nand the\nlifestyle,\nHarvey is\na man\u2019s\nman.\"\n\"This is a\nshow where\nmanwy\nasses are\nthreatened\nto be\nkicked.\"\nNow in its fourth series, Suits\nis an American legal drama\nthat premiered in June of\n2011. Created by Aaron Korsh, the\nfirst episode is one of the best pilots\nin recent television history.\nHere\u2019s the set up: Mike Ross (Parick\nJ. Adams) is a bright college dropout\nwith a photographic memory but\nno real future as a bike messenger.\nLiving in New York, he makes money\non the side by sitting the Law School\nAdmission Test for strangers.\nAfter getting pressured into paying\n$25,000 to keep his grandmother in\na private nursing home, Mike agrees\nto deliver a briefcase of marijuana\nto a Hotel room for his close friend\nTrevor (Tom Lipinski).\nThe drug deal turns out to be a\nsting operation that Mike cleverly\nfigures out before making the drop.\nIn his efforts to escape the task force,\nMike stumbles into a job interview\nwith Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht),\na Harvard educated lawyer at Pearson\nHardman who is deemed to be the\n\u201cbest closer in New York City.\u201d\nIn his recent promotion to senior\npartner at the firm, Harvey is\nexpected to hire a fellow Harvard\nLaw graduate as an associate.\nHarvey starts talking to Mike, who\nuses his photographic memory and\nencyclopedic knowledge of the law\nto convince Harvey to employ him,\ndespite never attending Harvard or\neven completing a degree.\nMike explains that he had always\ndreamt of being a lawyer, but lost\nhis College scholarship after getting\ncaught cheating on a maths exam.\nHis friend Trevor had convinced him\nto memorise a maths test, but the\npair unknowingly sold the answers\nto the Dean\u2019s daughter. Mike had\nbeen admitted as a transfer student\nto Harvard for the next academic\nyear, but the Dean\u2019s final act before\nresigning was to expel Mike and tell\nHarvard what he did.\nMike recognizes the opportunity\nhe has been gifted and promises\nHarvey that \u201cI\u2019ll help you school\nthose Harvard douches, and I\u2019ll be\nthe best god-damn lawyer you\u2019ve ever\nseen.\u201d\nHarvey decides to hire Mike and\ncover up the fact that he never went\nto Harvard Law. Shenanigans ensue.\nWith the job, the money, the looks\nand the lifestyle, Harvey is portrayed\nas a man\u2019s man; the American\ndream realised. However, Harvey is\nsomewhat emotionally stunted and\nhis alpha-male bravado prevents\nhim from having meaningful\nrelationships with other people.\nMike\u2019s compassionate streak and\ngenius intellect compliment Harvey\u2019s\ncold but perceptive nature to create a\ncompelling dynamic that the series\nexploits throughout.\nObsessed with getting his \u201cname\non the door\u201d, Harvey is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nof managing partner Jessica Pearson\n(Gina Torres), a strong woman in a\nman\u2019s world of top tier law.\nThe rest of the main cast includes\nLouis Litt (Rick Hoffman), a hard\nworking and pedantic junior partner\nwho takes great pride in his work\nbut is unpopular with the associates\nhe trains, Rachel Zane (Meghan\nMarkle), a paralegal at the firm and\nMike\u2019s love interest, and Donna\nPaulsen (Sarah Rafferty), Harvey\u2019s\nloyal private secretary and close\nconfidant who listens in on all the\nconversations in his office.\nThe first series is primarily\nconcerned with how Mike and\nHarvey form an unlikely partnership\nwhile keeping the big secret.\nSubsequent series deal with\ninternal problems at the firm,\nincluding allegations of malpractice,\nfending off mergers, winning big\ncases and quashing takeover bids.\nWith clear and distinct plot arcs,\nSuits is heavily serialised.\nSuits is a fast paced and witty series,\nwith great characters that you believe\nin. Slick in its presentation, the series\nmanages to retain a sense of humour\neven as the plot gets more serious.\nThe series thrives off conflict\nbetween intelligent people. Wellreasoned, heated arguments are\npacked into the scripts and this is\nwhat keeps you watching.\nThis is a show where an awful lot of\nthings are \u2018goddamn right\u2019 and many\nasses are threatened to be kicked. It\u2019s\na fun show that is essential viewing\nfor anyone with time to kill and a suit\nand tie fetish.\nThe first two series of Suits are on\nNetflix.

After\nleaving them for an extended\nperiod of time they become\nmouldable like plasticine,\nleading you to create a replica\nof Queens Tower, winning 1st\nprize in LeoSoc\u2019s competition.\nThis week, following the\nnews that legislation has been\npassed allowing the creation\nof three-parent babies you go\non the hunt for prospective\nfathers to create the perfect\nchild; however you are stuck\nin an awful dilemma of how to\nattain said sperm. Looks like\nyou\u2019ll be camping out in the\nlibrary toilets for a long time\u2026\nThis week in an attempt to\nreserve a computer in the\nlibrary, you use the age-old\ntechnique of jamming a penny\ninto the keyboard, and leave\nfor five hours. Unfortunately\nyou return to the library set\nablaze due to an \u201celectrical\nfault\u201d; the library baked\npotatoes are still on sale and\nthe taste roughly the same.\nThis week I know you are all\npositively gagging for the next\nstep in the fishcake recipe:\nPat away any liquid from the\nfish, then carefully lift the\npieces into the pan with the\nmash. Then mix together until\nroughly combined. Dust hands\nand work surface with flour\nand Create patties about 2.5cm\nthick. Repeat to make 8 cakes.\nFriday 20th of February\nFinally finished my potato haul, thank God. I am so glad I can now consume carbs\nthat I don\u2019t have to peel first.\nRan into Kiss Kraye today in the SCR, which I like to sneak into as they have\nreally nice hot chocolate. The only thing is I\u2019m not meant to be there as an\nundergrad, and once I saw my personal tutor there so I just turned around and\nleft straight away.\nKriss was pretty awkward, but he bought me a drink and told me about how work\nwas getting more and more stressful. He told me how he\u2019ll have to spend every\nweekend marking down all the sanitary products in the Union Shop, and he\u2019s not\nbeen told if he should label every single tampon or just the box, so is going to\nlabel them all individually just in case.\nHe also told me his Tinder success stories. Although some of them sounded a bit\ndodge (one girl refused to eat squid whilst out for dinner due to the time it was in\nthe lunar cycle) he seems to be going out every night.\nSaturday 21st February\nHave decided to get Tinder, as American Girl is a lost cause, Dorothy is never\ngoing to take me back.\nSunday 22nd February\nToday I sat in the library and just sat swiping every girl right for about three\nhours. I had to extend my distance range twice as I kept running out of girls.\nDiary Of A Fresher aged 18 3/4\nHave been speaking to one girl though quite a lot now, she\u2019s an older lady but seems really\ncool. She\u2019s like on her fifth year at Imperial but told me that she\u2019s still not completed her\nfourth year, so in reality she\u2019s basically a third year and I could have taken a gap year\nmaking her, if you think about it, only really in the year above.\nMonday 23rd February\nHave added Cougar Girl on whatsapp. She keeps turning the conversation sexual though,\nwhich is scary as I bet she\u2019s so experienced. Maybe I should watch 50 Shades of Grey\njust in case she wants to do bondage or something.\nTuesday 24th February\nNo-one will come to the cinema with me to see 50 Shades.\nWednesday 25th February\nCougar woman is getting increasingly frisky. One of her messages was about how she likes\nto have sex in this hidden staircase between the fourth and fifth floor of the library. What\nthe hell, I am always on fourth floor and I have never seen this staircase.\nThursday 26th February\nMaybe she once had sex on the main staircase, maybe that is what she meant. I am\nnow too deep but am scared she may try to seduce me whilst I do my lab report. Spent\nall afternoon thinking about having sex in library, so had to go home with awkward hard\non. Luckily roommate was out at some ABACUS event so could relieve the pressure in the\npeace of my own room, instead of the shared showers.\nHave bought 50 Shades of amazon and plan to read the book under the covers of my bed\nso no-one will know.\n\n"

Sir Rifkind\nhad hoped to continue as MP for\nKensington, which is one of the most\ndesirable Tory seats in the UK, but\nresigned after becoming embroiled in\nfresh \u201ccash-for-access\u201d allegations.\nRifkind, a former Conservative\nforeign secretary, has denied any\nwrong doing with regards to the\nDispatches investigation responsible\nfor his resignation, where he was\nsecretly filmed offering to sell his\npolitical contacts and influence to a\nChinese firm in return for thousands\nof pounds at a daily rate. The fake\nHong Kong based company, created\nby Dispatches and Daily Telegraph\nreporters, claimed to be seeking\npeople with business and political\nexperience to become members on\nthe company\u2019s advisory board.\nIn the undercover footage Rifkind\nremarked, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how\nmuch free time I have. I spend a lot\nof time reading, I spend a lot of time\nwalking. Because I\u2019m not a minister\nor full-time working for one person.\nI can sort out my day. I am self-employed so nobody pays my salary. I\nhave to earn my income but when I\u2019m\nnot doing something I can do what I\nlike.\u201d Rifkind is not self-employed,\ndue to his \u00a367k salary as a member of\nparliament for Kensington.\nDipatches also met with former\nLabour minister and foreign secretary\nJack Straw with a similar offer. In\nthe meeting, Straw, who is standing\ndown at the upcoming election, said\n\u201cThe best way of dealing with these\nthings is under the radar.\u201d In the\nundercover investigation he was\nfilmed asking what the organisation\nwould want from him and what the\ntime commitments would be, before\nexplaining that \u201cNormally, if I\u2019m\ndoing a speech or something it\u2019s\n\u00a35000 a day, that\u2019s what I charge.\u201d\nIn a subsequent BBC news\ninterview, Mr Straw remarked that\n\u201cThis was a very sophisticated, skilful\ndeceit and like Malcolm Rifkind I fell\ninto it.\u201d\nIn Sir Malcolm Rifkind\u2019s Today\ninterview, the MP said the claims\nare \u201cunfounded and I am going to\nfight them with all my strength.\u201d He\ndeclared that \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to be\nembarrassed about. Every single thing\nI said to these people, I would have\nbeen willing to say on television or to\nyou if you\u2019d put the same questions to\nme at the time.\u201d The senior politician\nwent on to contend that it is perfectly\nacceptable for MPs to have outside\ninterests.\nRifkind argued that it is unrealistic\nfor MPs to live on \u00a367k, because \u201cthe\nvast majority of people of a business\nor professional background earn far,\nfar more than that\u201d, going onto say\nthat if prospective MP candidates\ncannot earn money on the side\nthrough \u2018second jobs\u2019 then \u201cthey just\nwon\u2019t come to the House of Commons\nat all, and parliament will lose their\nskills.\u201d\nIt is believed that hundreds of\nMPs and peers have taken on similar\nagreements to those offered by Sir\nMalcolm and Mr Straw, and the\nconcept of politicians being for hire\nwas discussed in this week\u2019s Prime\nMinister\u2019s Question Time. There are\ncalls to reform the parliamentary\nregulations that currently allow MPs\nto make multiple times what they\nearn as MPs so long as it is reported\nin the register for member\u2019s interests,\nwhich is public information. This\nfresh \u2018cash for access\u2019 touches on\nthe wider issues of transparency in\nWestminster, the buying of political\ninfluence from private firms and MP\nsalaries.\nSir Malcolm had represented the\nKensington constituency since 2005\nand had already been suspended as\na member of the Conservative party\nbefore his resignation. He has held\nvarious high positions and cabinet\npositions under the Prime Ministers\nMargaret Thatcher and John Major,\nincluding Secretary of State for\nScotland, Defence Secretary and\nForeign Secretary. Malcolm Rikfind\nis a member of the Queen\u2019s Privy\nCounsel and received a knighthood\nin John Major\u2019s resignation honours,\nbecoming a Knight Commander of\nthe Order of St Michael and St George\n(KCMG). This is an honour appointed\non individuals in recognition of their\nimportant services to Commonwealth\nor foreign nations. Throughout this\ntime he was the MP for Edinburgh\nPentlands, a position he held from\n1974 to 1997. He took a break from\npolitics until his return to parliament\nin 2005. After the Conservative\ndefeat that took place in that year\u2019s\ngeneral election Sir Malcolm was a\npotential contender for leader of the\nparty.\nIn a statement Sir Malcolm\nexplained that, \u201cI had intended to\nseek one further term as MP for\nKensington, before retiring from the\nHouse of Commons. I have concluded\nthat to end the uncertainty it would\nbe preferable, instead, to step down at\nthe end of this parliament.\u201d\n\u201cThis is entirely my personal\ndecision. I have had no such requests\nfrom my constituency association but\nI believe that it is the right and proper\naction to take.\u201d\n\u201cAs regards the allegations of\nChannel 4 and the Daily Telegraph I\nfind them contemptible and will not\ncomment further at this time.\u201d\nIn a separate statement made\nTory MP for Kensington will step\ndown at election\nSir Malcolm Rifkind also resigns immediately as Chairman of the\nIntelligence and Security Committee. Joshua Renken reports on the latest\nscandal to erupt from Westminster. Rifkind speaks to Policy Exchange in\nabout his resignation as Chairman\nof the Security and Intelligence\nCommittee, Rifkind said, \u201cNone of\nthe current controversy with which I\nam associated is relevant to my work\nas chairman of the intelligence and\nsecurity committee of parliament.\nHowever, I have today informed my\ncolleagues that while I will remain a\nmember of the committee, I will step\ndown from the chairmanship.\u201d\nTogether with former Labour\nforeign secretary Jack Straw, Sir\nMalcolm has referred himself to\nParliament\u2019s standards watchdog and\ndenies breaching House of Commons\nrules. Many MPs earn considerable\namounts of money through their\n\u2018second jobs\u2019.\nA spokesman for the Conservative\nParty said: \u201cSir Malcolm has had a\nlong career of distinguished service\nboth to the Conservative Party and\nthe country. We respect and support\nhis decision to stand down.\u201d\nRifkind speaks to Policy Exchange in 2012.

Darkness.\nClaustrophobia. Darkness.\nMadness. Darkness. Dalia\nTaha\u2019s new play Fireworks is not the\ncelebration that the title suggests.\nTelling the story of two families\nbattling for sanity in a besieged\nPalestine, Fireworks examines how\nchildren rationalise and interact with\nwar and death, a jolting and twisted\ndichotomy.\nI was apprehensive before going\nto see Fireworks. I had read about it,\nabout the subjects it covered. I knew\nit was not going to be an easy watch.\nBut it was definitely going to be a\nfascinating new take on the impact\nof warfare. The play is a product of\na nearly two decade partnership the\nRoyal Court has had with Palestinian\nwriters, developing their untapped\ntalent and unique life experience\nto create some wonderful pieces of\ntheatre.\nAnd what a way it started. The set:\na single concrete room, suffocating\nin its rigidity, faded azure walls,\nminimal belongings, a crypt for the\nliving. Dramatic lighting plunged us\nbetween total blackness and glimpses\nof their life, snapshots of a daily scene\nthat photographed the surreal scene\nfor us. We are constantly cut between\nthese very short scenes throughout\nthe whole play, highlighting the\nfleeting nature of the moments and\nlives we were witnessing.\nWe are presented with two\nfamilies: Khalid (Saleh Bakri),\nhis wife Nahla (Sirine Saba) and\ntheir daughter Lubna (Shakira\nRiddell-Morales) and Ahmad (Nabil\nElouahabi), Samar (Shereen Martin)\nand their son Khalil (Yusuf Hofri).\nThey are linked by their shared\ntower block and shared misery.\nThrough them, two starkly different\nstories are played out, yet they are\ninherently intertwined by this\nshared experience, their behaviours\ncompletely understandable given the\nsituation despite being unexplainable\nwhen viewed without context. It is\na wonderful yet scaringly poignant\ninsight into this inhuman situation\nwe find these individuals, each coping\nand rationalising in their own way.\nCoping. That and how different\ncoping methods interact in such a\nstressful situation is what the piece\nis about. Whether it be revenge,\nreligion, insurmountable grief,\ndistraction, violence or escapism,\neach character has their own way of\ntackling this reality. Rockets become\nfireworks, dreams become reality,\neverything melts into an amalgam of\nfantasy and misery.\nLubna\u2019s story plays out on\nthe background of her brother\nAli, \u201cmartyred\u201d by crossfire in a\nhorrifying accident. Her mother\nNahla is utterly broken, completely\ngrief-stricken that she wants to take\nher own life just so she can return\nto him. Khalid, her husband, copes\nby distracting himself with broken\nradios. Lubna, jealous of her brother\u2019s\nattention, does anything to win her\nparents back.\nKhalil on the other hand has been\ndeeply disturbed by the war around\nhim, moulded by its perversion into\na violent individual that his father\ndescribes as a \u201cpunishment\u201d. His\nmother uses him as a way to escape\nreality, preserving him in an eternal\nchildhood so they can escape away\ntogether to a distant planet in the\ngames. But he has no interest in\nthat. His world is one of guns, spies\nand death. His father, disturbed by\nhis wife\u2019s psychological castration\nof their son is determined to turn\nhim into a man. He teaches him\nhow to shave. He teaches him about\nmartyrdom. It is a twisted reality.\nWhat I think is good about this\nShakira Riddell- Morales (Lubna) and Yusuf Hofri (Khalil) in Fireworks at the Royal Court Theatre. Photo: Helen Maybanks\nKamil McClelland examines the Royal Court\u2019s new piece of Palestinian theatre\n\"This is not\na political\nplay. This\nis a play\nabout how\nunhappiness\ncan twist\nall the\nhumanity\nwe take for\ngranted.\"\n\"The set:\na single\nconcrete\nroom,\nsuffocating\nin its\nrigidity, a\ncrypt for\nthe living.\"\nplay is that it does not at any time\nexplicitly mention Israel, making the\nstory applicable to any war zone in\nwhich children or in fact any civilians\nare caught up. This is not a political\nplay. This is a play about people\nand about how unhappiness and an\nunnatural situation can twist all the\nhumanity we take for granted. Adults\nescape reality by turning life into a\nfantasy, a game. Children age much\ntoo young, with games filled with\nthe death and violence that they see\naround them, as if that is normality.\nChild actors are troublesome\nfor me. Call me biased but I find it\ndifficult to engage with them like I\ncan with adults, perhaps due to their\ninherent lack of experience, their\ninelastic emotional range or their\ngrating voice! There is little that can\nbe done in a play that is ultimately\nabout child psychology but I found\nthe performances of Hofri and\nRiddell-Morales fell slightly short. I\nguess I\u2019m the bad guy now!\nHowever, overall the acting was\nnot too bad and you did find yourself\nutterly engrossed in their suffering\nas the story crescendoed to its bitter\nclimax. \u201cI want to tell you a story\u201d.\nLubna, dressed in her Eid clothes,\nconcludes the play, the story of her\nand her family\u2019s life not as reality\nbut as a mere story, as if it didn\u2019t\nexist, as if the whole story of their life\nwas just a dream. It is chilling, the\nperfect ending to a play that leaves\nyou feeling deeply uncomfortable,\nprovoking you to react to a drama\nthat is much too real just to be a story.\nIt must still be happening throughout\nPalestine to this day and throughout\nany war zone across the world where\ninnocents are forced to face realities\nthat they never chose. I look forward\nto Taha\u2019s future productions. She\nshows plenty of promise and sheds on\na new light on this age-old story.\nFireworks is at the Royal Court until\n14th\nMarch. Tickets are \u00a320, \u00a310 on\nMondays\n\n"

It comes into\nplay here: by looking up that\nnumber,it\u2019s easier for the Home\nOffice will be able to see if you\u2019ve\nalready paid anything towards\ntuition and/or accommodation,\nplus any other important info.\nThat declaration isn\u2019t enough,\nas you then need a bunch of\noriginal documents as proof.\nIt\u2019s these that are finicky to\ncollate\u2013these documents\ninclude your pre-university (A2,\nIB etc) and English language\nproficiency (IELTS/TOEFL)\nexam results,ATAS certificate\nif needed,recent medical\ncertification proving you\u2019re free\nfrom tuberculosis (more money\nfor the exam there!) and\u2013most\nimportantly\u2013supporting financial\ndocumentation.Minor oversights\nby applicants in this part are a\nmajor cause for visa refusal; if\nEnglish isn\u2019t your country\u2019s official\nlanguage,painstakingly-certified\ntranslations cost time and money.\nFinancially sponsored students\nneed detailed affidavits,which\nwill take time to obtain depending\non your sponsor\u2019s efficiency.\nAs for self-sponsored students,\nthey have to prepare detailed\nbank statements,along with a\nsigned letter from a bank official\nproving that the amount of money\nneeded has been present in said\naccount for at least 28 consecutive\ndays.Further documentation is\nneeded to prove the student has\npermission to access these funds.\nApplicants from countries\nconsidered low-risk do not\nnecessarily have to submit all the\nfinancial proof needed,which\nin essence should speed things\nup; however,as the Home Office\nreserves the right to request\nfor these at random,you\u2019re\noften required to collate those\ndocuments anyway.\nAfter all that,you have to make\nan appointment with the relevant\nvisa office in their country to\nhand these (and your passport) in\nperson.As you\u2019re not allowed to\napply more than 3 months before\nyour course start date,visa offices\nget stretched to beyond capacity\nbetween June and September (one\ncould consider it early training in\nBritish queuing culture!)...which\nmeans even with appointments,\nqueues often last a few hours.\nAfter submission,you have to\nwait for at least 3 weeks (in peak\nseason) until you\u2019re contacted\nwith the news that your app has\nbeen processed.You then have\nto return to pick up your passport\nand check if you\u2019ve been approved\nor not.If you\u2019ve somehow\nbeen rejected,appeals and re-submissions will cost you more\ntime (and potentially money) to\nprocess.\nThe red tape and costs don\u2019t just\nstop there.Certain students have\nto register with the police and\npay \u00a334 pounds within 7 days of\narrival,and let\u2019s not forget other\ncosts of setting up your new life\nabroad: long-haul flights,clothes,\nkitchen equipment...that\u2019s just the\ntip of the iceberg!\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nIn an email sent out earlier this\nmonth to undergraduate students\nexpecting to graduate this year,\nthe College announced a change\nfrom usual procedures for the annual\nceremony.\nThe graduation day, known\nas Commemoration Day to\ncommemorate the visit of Queen\nVictoria to the Royal College of\nChemistry in 1845, is usually held on\na Wednesday in October.\nHowever, this year the ceremony\nwill take place on Monday 19th.\nIn its email, the College described\nthe change as necessary in order to\n\u201cenable all graduating students to\nattend\u201d. It goes on to say, \u201cA fifth of\ngraduating students have visas with\nan expiry date in advance of the date\npreviously considered.\u201d\nA separate email sent out to all\nCollege staff advised lecturers that\nmitigation would be put in place to\ncater for the disruption to teaching,\nsince more classes take place on a\nMonday than a Wednesday, as all\nstudents have Wednesday afternoons\noff for sports practices.\nWhilst students usually have a free\nday during Commemoration Day,\nlikely as staff are busy taking part\nin the ceremonies or in the various\nreceptions for graduating students,\nsome students last year still had some\nacademic commitments during the\nday.\nVisa expiry causes\nCommemoration\nDay to move\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\nDespite complaints from many\nquarters, the Government\nwill be implementing its\npreviously announced plans to\ncharge non-EU nationals (including\nstudents) for access to NHS services.\nThe proposals were initially\nannounced as part of the\nImmigration Bill in October 2013.\nImperial College Union last year\npassed a paper officially opposing this\nproposal in the Immigration Bill. The\npaper, as voted on by Council, also\ninstructed the Union to lobby College\nto \u201censure measures are in place to\nmitigate the effect of this Bill\u201d.\nStarting in April, foreign nationals\napplying for, or extending, a visa\nfor longer than 6 months will be\nrequired to pay a surcharge of \u00a3200\nfor NHS access, on top of existing visa\ncharges. However a discount of \u00a350\nis available to students, and access is\nalso included for dependents of visa\napplicants.\nIn addition to the surcharge, the\nGovernment has also instructed\nNHS trusts to reclaim up to 150%\nof the cost of a hospital procedure\nfrom patients outside the EU, with\nNHS trusts liable for a fine if they do\nnot take measures to retrieve these\ncharges from patients.\nEU nationals will also be charged\n125% of the cost of NHS hospital\nprocedures, although patients will\nnot be liable for these charges as\nsuch treatment is covered under\nthe European healthcare insurance\nscheme, using an EHIC (European\nHealth Insurance Card).\nHowever, under this new policy,\nGP appointments will remain free of\ncharge.\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has\nintroduced these premiums over the\nnormal cost of the hospital procedure\nin order to incentivise NHS trusts\nto recoup the money. In a speech at\na lunch last year, Hunt said, \u201cI have\nno problem [...] with foreigners using\nour NHS, as long as they contribute\nto it either through taxes or through\npaying charges. We need to be much\nbetter at collecting that revenue.\u201d\nBritish Medical Association Council\nchairman, Dr. Mark Porter, said on\nthe policy: \"Anyone accessing NHS\nservices should be eligible to do so but\na doctor's duty is to treat the patient\nthat's in front on them, not to act as\nborder guard.\u201d\n\u00a3150 NHS student visa charge\nstarts in April\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\n\n"

It\u2019s fascinating and the best way of\nchanging people\u2019s lives, often for the\nbetter, often for the worse.\nJR: What do you think you would\nbring to Kensington, if elected as\nMP?\nRMG: The first thing I\u2019d bring is I\u2019d\nbe the youngest MP elected, because\nI\u2019m 23. I would bring someone who is\ngenuinely interested in everyone in\nthe borough, unlike the current Tory\nincumbent who is only interested in\nthe hyper wealthy.\nI would be someone who is\ninterested in solving the housing\ncrisis that we currently have in the\ncapital, especially in Kensington.\nSomebody who is interested in\nlooking seriously, nationally at how\nwe can change the way our democracy\nworks to bring about proper political\nreform. Somebody who\u2019s going\nto stand up for all residents of\nKensington. You know Kensington\nhas lots of very poor areas and lots of\nvery rich areas.\nI would be somebody who\u2019s\ngenuinely interested in social\nmobility and creating a more equal\nsociety. And somebody also who\nis willing to speak their mind. I\nwould want to be a very strong,\nindependently minded backbench\nMP who is entirely interested in\ngetting stuff done. And getting stuff\ndone in an imaginative way, not in a\nboring way of going along with what\nthe system likes, which is what I think\ntoo many MPs like.\nJR: What are the key issues you\nfeel need to be addressed in the\nlocal area, and what could you\ndo better than the current Tory\nincumbent Malcolm Rifkind MP?\nRMG: Pretty much anything because\nRifkind is completely hopeless.\nIn Kensington I think the really\nimportant issues are basically\nhousing, and the closely related\nissue of small businesses; which\nsound kind of boring, but actually\nsmall businesses rely entirely on an\neffective community. In Kensington\nat the moment we have a very\nworrying situation where large parts\nof the borough are bought by foreign\nproperty investors, and abandoned\nand nobody actually goes there.\nSo it\u2019s a terrible buy-to-leave\nsituation. This is ignoring the\nextraordinary disaster of extreme\nproperty price increases. So that\u2019s\nobviously a very big issue.\nEducation is also extremely\nimportant because the borough\u2019s\nschools are very divided. You have\na huge number of extremely elite\nschools, you know... good, but you also\nhave a very large number of schools\nwith overwhelmingly working class\nand ethnic minority students which is\nnot good because it indicates a social\nand indeed cultural divide. Which\nis obviously a very bad thing. So it\nwould be quite useful if we could not\nhave that.\nJR: How would you go about\nsolving the housing problem?\nRMG: Well the problem is so giant\nthat no single MP could solve it.\nBut one thing that I\u2019d want to do in\nparticular is work as an MP for the\nrights of the people who have possibly\nbeen subject to bad landlords which\nwe have a lot of, unfortunately, in the\nborough. And also be an active voice\nfor introducing some kind of sanity\nin the housing market. For example\nabolishing buy to leave property\nlaws altogether which is extremely\ndamaging to literally everybody in\nthe entire country. Also working\nto introduce some sort of national\ndiscussion and organisation for\nserious analysis for what the property\nmarket is actually doing to our entire\nsociety.\nWe need to think about the next\ngeneration, which you and I are\npart of. We need to think about\nwhat this is going to do to our\nsociety. I\u2019m pretty concerned that\nwe are currently moving to a feudal\nsituation where basically people are\ngoing to have to inherit property\nfrom their parents like it\u2019s the 13th\ncentury or something, in order to\nown property outright. But I\u2019d like\nto emphasise that in Kensington\nand Chelsea specifically, I\u2019m more\nconcerned about buy to leave\nbecause that is a totally extreme\nmanifestation of investing in\nproperty. So I think it\u2019s important to\nemphasis that I\u2019d want to tackle that\nas an MP rather than move onto the\nenormous, all-consuming question\nof what we are going to do about the\nhousing crisis. I\u2019d want to concentrate\non what I can do in the borough\nspecifically.\nJR: What could you do for\nImperial students who live in the\nKensington constituency?\nRMG: Well, I am actually roughly\ntheir age, which is quite useful. All\nthe other candidates are certainly\nnot in their early twenties. First of\nall I want to abolish tuition fees,\nand be a strong voice in that area of\npolicy. I\u2019d want to make sure that we\nincrease investment in science and\nengineering education in Britain. I\u2019m\nalso genuinely personally interested\nin mathematics and astrophysics in\nparticular, and evolutionary biology.\nI think that, like again, it sounds very\npretentious but, I want to defend\nthe fact that we need knowledge and\nunderstanding for its own sake, which\nnot enough politicians do. Including\nin my own party.\nI want to be somebody who actually\ndefends what it is to be a student,\nin addition to championing British\nuniversities internationally and in\nparliament.\nI should add the Lib Dems have\nintroduced a postgraduate loan\nsystem for the first time, which I want\nto spend quite a lot of time working\non how we expand thatw when it\u2019s\nintroduced in 2016. I think Imperial\nwould really benefit from that. One\nmore thing, I\u2019m also very interested\nin the legalisation of cannabis, which\nis obviously something that students\nare interested in.\nJR: Do you feel that the coalition\nhas been a success?\nRMG: Yes. Because, bearing in mind\nnobody thought it would be a success\nat all, the Liberal Democrats have\nachieved a huge amount that we\nwould obviously never have achieved\notherwise. We\u2019ve introduced the\npupil premium for schools that\nhave particularly large numbers of\npupils who aren\u2019t very well off. We\u2019ve\nabolished income tax for everyone\nearning under \u00a310,000 which the\n\"Rifkind is\ncompletely\nhopeless.\"\nRobin is one of the youngest Lib Dem candidates in the country.

It allow users to view\nand write short recommendations\nanywhere in the world.\nMost interesting of all to us,\nhowever, is that the founder Krishan\nPatel started the apps during his\nunderground Computing course as\nhis final year project in Imperial.\nYung Nam Cheah: Give us a brief\nhistory of the app!\nKrishnan Patel: I started the app\nas my final year project and it was\nsomething that I enjoyed a lot. I spent\nmore time than I should have on it\nand continued working on it part-time even after graduation. Before I\nstarted working on Kites full time in\n2014 though I also worked on anther\nstart-up project which unfortunately\ndidn\u2019t work out.\nYNC: Why did you start Kites?\nKP: It might sound strange to some\npeople, but I am not a fan of trying\nout new things in the real world\nwithout \u2018knowing\u2019 that they are going\nto be good. However, I am open to\nchecking out new places if they are\nrecommended to me by a friend.\nOne example would be this Italian\nrestaurant around the corner from\nImperial (Da Mario\u2019s) that I never\nknew existed until these guys from\nmy group projects took me there. At\nfirst only my friends used it and we\nsend private messages to each other,\nbut then it gained traction and I\nopened it to the public.\nYNC: What was the idea behind it?\nKP: The idea is to allow people to find\ninteresting things and learn new stuff\nabout their city, or discover trivia\nthat they would otherwise not known\nin a city they visited. It\u2019s the little\nthings like this is Princess Diana\u2019s\nfavourite restaurant. I have lived in\nLondon for 16 years and I love that\nthere are still so many new places to\ndiscover.\nI love twitter so I based the format\nof Kites on it, with a word limit (140)\nto keep the information concise.\nPeople can follow each other and\nfavourite Kites and comment on it.\nRecently I have added a collection\nfeature that can link Kites together to\nform a mini tour and I plan to expand\non that!\nYNC: Why is it call Kites?\nKP: Originally when the app was still\nprivate, you would not be able to\nsee the message until you are close\nby, kind of like a kite.

Photo: Getty Images\nZain Rizvi reports on the first ten days down under\nImmortals lose last game of season\nIC Tempest\ntakes Crystal\nPalace by\nstorm\nLast Sunday four athletes from\nImperial College took second\nplace at the Legacy Cheer and\nDance championships at Crystal\nPalace National Sports Centre.\nImperial College Tempest,\nconsisting of Kayla (flyer),Ben\n(back spot),Fez and Daryl (both\nbases),have only been training\ntogether for three months,and\nthis was the first time they\u2019d all\nbeen on a competition mat at the\nsame time.In fact,the first time\nthat they had run the routine with\nmusic was the day before.\nIC Tempest is a part of Imperial\nCollege Titans,the College\u2019s\ncheerleading programme.\nCompeting separately to the\nteam,they perform routines with\na complete focus on stunting,\navoiding jumps,tumbling and a\ndance routine.Tempest is one of\ntwo group stunts running with\nImperial this year.\nWith Ben nursing a back injury,\naggravated by competing earlier\nin the day,the group were only\nable to finish one full run through\nof the routine on the warm-up mat,but all of the stunts\nthankfully hit (more or less) and\nTempest made their way gingerly\ntowards the holding area for\nteams ready to compete.\nNerves overcame the group on\nthe mat slightly,and they were\nunable to put in the twisting\ndismounts and pike basket,but\nthe score still came in at 83.5 out\nof a possible 100.\nTwo of the team members\ncompeted again in the same day\nfor Inferno Cheer Avengers,one\nof the London All Star teams.\nInferno Cheer also plays host\nto two other students from\nImperial,and three alumni.\nMariza and Nikki,having cheered\nfor three years with Imperial,\nalso competed their group stunt\nfor the first time,taking second\nplace within their category,\nand qualifying for the national\ncompetition,held at the Copper\nBox Arena in the Olympic Park.\nImperial College Tempest\nwill perform again in April at\nthe British Cheer Association\nUniversity competition,at which\nthe full team,Imperial College\nTitans,will compete for the first\ntime this year.They\u2019ve taken on\nboard the judge\u2019s comments,and\nare pumped to get up to Telford\nand bring home Grand Champs.\nBEN HOWITT\nIC TEMPEST\nSAM HILL\nIMPERIAL IMMORTALS\nIf someone had tried to sit down\nand write a script for this Cricket\nWorld Cup, it would have already\nbeen tossed into the bin. With one-day cricket\u2019s most coveted prize up\nfor grabs, the unexpected tends to\nhappen. Since Ireland\u2019s win over the\nWest Indies on the 3rd day of the\ntournament, it was obvious that this\nWorld Cup would be full of surprises.\nThe cricketing Gods have shown\nus that they do indeed possess a keen\nsense of irony \u2013 there was talk at\nthe start of the competition that the\n2019 World Cup will be cut down\nfrom 14 teams to just 10, limiting the\nopportunities for associate members,\nbut they soon showed us who\u2019s boss.\nAfter Ireland\u2019s win, Scotland tried\nhard to spoil a World Cup favourite\u2019s\nbest-laid plans when it met New\nZealand in Dunedin, taking seven\nscalps to give New Zealand a scare\nbefore the Black Caps sealed victory.\nAfghanistan also looked set to cause\na major upset against Sri Lanka on\nSunday after it had already ensured\nBangladesh had to work hard for\nvictory in Canberra. And this is only\n10 days into the World Cup! Oh, the\nExcitement!\nHowever, it must be noted that\nmost World Cups tend to follow the\ncareer trajectory of the Rolling Stones:\nstarting out with thrills, youth and\nvigour, peaking around the middle,\nthen dragging on and on and on in\nan increasingly desperate attempt to\nexcite an audience that long ago saw\nall it had to offer.\nWe\u2019ve had our fair share of thrills\nalready in India v Pakistan and\nAustralia v England. England lost,\nnaturally, but they didn\u2019t emerge\nfrom their thrashing empty-handed.\nAs Moeen Ali put it last Tuesday,\nthey got a \u201cwake up call\u201d, as well as\nnabbing a minor umpiring injustice\nwhich they can now whinge about for\nthe next couple of months.\nPakistan again showed everyone\nhow generous a nation they are by\ngifting India (more specifically,\nShikhar Dhawan) runs, and then\nstaying true to tradition and\ncollapsing faster than the Greek\neconomy.\nWe even had 3 out of 3 wins for\nNew Zealand, which must\u2019ve pleased\nthose pundits who had tipped New\nZealand as favourites in the belief\nthat this makes them stand out from\nthe 99.9% of other pundits who also\ntipped New Zealand to win the World\nCup.\nAustralia have played 1 and had 1\nSunday 22nd February saw the\nImmortals play their last BUCS\ngame of the season at Fortress\nHarlington against the Bath Killer\nBees. Earlier in the season the Killer\nBees beat the Immortals 13-6 at their\nswamp of a pitch at high altitude.\nHowever, we were keen to change\nthings on our own glorious pitch.\nBath kicked off to start the game and\nthe Immortals offense took the pitch,\nwhere they started to pound the ball\nand run hard at the Bath defence. This\nset the tone for the game, which saw\nthe hard-hitting, rapid and explosive\nImmortals run game drive down the\npitch multiple times hindered only\nby mental errors. However, the first\nfew drives had a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as\nthe Immortals struggled to finish and\nscore points. The defence were not\nplaying at their usual level with so\nmany people playing out of position\nand injuries to key players although\nsome players certainly \u2018stepped\nup\u2019 (thank God for Angry Will\u2019s\nFacebook post).\nMarin \u2018Wet Burp\u2019 Tuleu got himself\nan interception by grabbing the ball\nstraight out of a receiver\u2019s hands\nand Markus \u2018Bobblehead\u2019 Mohr,\nplaying out of position, got a tasty\ntackle for a loss. However, even\nthrough the efforts of the defence\nBath scored twice in the first half\nmeaning the Immortals were down\n14-0 at half time. The defence came\nout after the half and played with all\nthe physicality and fire we are used\nto seeing from them and it seemed\nthat momentum had swung the\nImmortals way. The offense came out\nand played hard, running strong and\npassing well to drive down the pitch.\nThis culminated in a beautiful pass\nfrom Toby Sinclair to Noach BenHaim who made perhaps the catch of\nthe season juggling it whilst getting\nillegally interfered with but never\nlosing the ball to score the Immortals\nfirst touchdown. This gave the\nImmortals a boost that was short\nlived as Bath scored again twice.\nHowever, on the last play of the game\nBami \u2018Twerkteam\u2019 Falana broke free\nfor a 75 yard run after some great\npersonal play and good blocking\nall round and scored perhaps the\nnaughtiest rushing touchdown of the\nseason.\nThe games Most Valuable Players\nwere: Markus \u2018Bobblehead\u2019 Mohr\n(Line MVP for making plays on both\nlines and playing out of position),\nMad Dog Pecs (Offense MVP for\nplaying well out of position, picking\nup yards and only biting off 3 ears\non the day), Angry Will Nicholson\n(Defensive MVP for playing hard\nwhile injured and making hits all\nday) and Bami \u2018Twerkteam\u2019 Falana\n(Overall MVP for great play every\ndown, running hard and fast and\npunishing the Bath defence).\nThe team is un-flattered by the score\nline but a good game was had. Special\nthanks to the Imperial College Titans\nCheerleaders for coming down and\nsupporting the team throughout\nthe horrible weather. The next time\nthe team plays it will be in our own\nVARSITY MATCH against King\u2019s\nCollege Regents on the 8th March for\nthe Londonbowl trophy at Honor Oak\nPark, come down and support ya bois.\nmatch abandoned due to rain & Sri\nLanka have had a mediocre start with\n1 win and 1 loss.\nThe other big gun in the\ntournament, South Africa, enjoyed\nopening success against Zimbabwe\nbut couldn\u2019t quite stomach the spicy\nvindaloo that is the Indian Cricket\nteam. Crushed by 130 runs, South\nAfrica will need to bounce back\nquickly, as it seems we may have a\nnew favourite on the cards\u2026\n\n"

The number of migrants\nlanding on Italian shores quadrupled\nlast year, as more than 170,000\npeople from the Middle East and\nAfrica fled humanitarian crises,\npiling pressure on the EU to form\na long-term migration strategy.\nSyrians fleeing civil war and Eritreans\nescaping forced conscription\ncomprised nearly half of all Italian\nboat arrivals in 2014, according to\nthe International Organisation for\nMigration (IOM). Refugees from\nLibya, Mali, Sudan, Nigeria and\nGambia were also common. Many\nmigrants brave a perilous journey\nacross the Mediterranean to Italy\nbefore travelling overland to other\nEuropean countries. More than 3,200\nfatalities were recorded last year, and\nmany more are expected as the EU\ncontroversially scales back its rescue\noperation.\nMaurice described the daily\nstruggle for existence of the migrants\nsquatting in \u2018the Jungle\u2019 of Calais,\nand many find it shocking that such\npoor conditions can be found in one\nof the most developed countries in\nEurope. The apathy of EU members\nto take in migrants has frustrated\nmany advocating the case of those\nsuffering from the aftershocks of the\nArab Spring. Stephen spearheaded\nthe need for more commitment from\nthe UK to support refugees, and \u201cdo\naway with the preconceptions that\nall migrants are unskilled and are\na burden on society\u201d. Academics\nare often the most persecuted\nindividuals, due to their exposure to\nknowledge and ability to enlighten\nothers. Many of our research efforts\naround WWII would have been\nthwarted if we did not intervene\nto help academics in plight. So the\nSustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) have some very immediate\nquestions to address: why are\nWestern countries doing so little to\nsupport refugees and what plans do\nwe have to mitigate not conflict and\nclimate-related migration?\nAlthough eliminating hunger is a\nrequisite of development, it is now\nbecoming important to take into\naccount nutritional security through\nfood research and development\nexpenditures, and production\nmethods. Advancements in\nagriculture were key to achieving the\nfirst Millennium Development Goal\nof eradicating extreme hunger and\npoverty, and over the last 15 years, a\nnew concept has emerged: Sustainable\nIntensification. This is an agricultural\ndevelopment concept advanced\nby Imperial\u2019s Sir Gordon Conway,\nrepresented at the conference by\nEmily Alpert. Emily reasoned that\nclimate change and economic poverty\nare highly entwined, and a step-change in agricultural productivity\nmust be achieved through sustainable\nland use, tackling pests and diseases,\nbetter management of: soils,\nwater and nutrient resource. Mike\nWarmington of One Acre Fund\nhighlighted the capital deficiencies\nin rural economies, and that access\nto microfinance and business skills,\ncan help farmers improve yields\nand their livelihoods. The key to\nmany agricultural development\nprogrammes is proper engagement\nof female stakeholders, who must\nbe given a voice, to improve their\naccess to agricultural and ecological\nknowledge to change a daily struggle\nfor sustenance into a profitable\nbusiness, capable of generating\nsurplus product.\nBy lunch, many of Imperial\u2019s\nengineers were feeling a little lost.\nDavid Measures from CARLA\nInternational brought the\ntechnophiles back into touch, with a\nworkshop on the role of Appropriate\nTechnology in development. Many of\nthe SDGs will rely on engineering for\ntheir implementation, particularly\nthe ability of engineers to apply\nsocio-centric, and sustainable design\nprincipals to address water security,\nGreenhouse Gas emissions and\nenergy crises. Where best to start\nthan looking at what has gone wrong\nwith technology based development?\nMany failed projects are a result of\npoor understanding of stakeholder\nneeds, and the inadequate robustness\nof systems, when taken into\nchallenging environments.\nDavid used the example of a\nUNICEF water tower in Kenya, which\nrelied on solar panels for pumping.\nLocal users simply left the tap on,\nover-abstracted the water supply,\nand then resided to harvesting water\nfrom fetid pools \u2013 many died as a\nconsequence of poor design, and\nyes, the solar panels were stolen. It is\ncrucial that if we choose to support\noverseas development through the\nSDGs, we must properly engage those\ninteracting with technology, ideally\nto support local innovation, over the\ninterventionist approaches of aid\nagencies and Governments.\nNumerous models of global health\nprograms have emerged over the\nyears. They range from vertical\nprograms focusing on solutions for\nspecific diseases and conditions,\nto horizontal ones focusing on\nachieving universal health coverage\nby encouraging the establishment of\ncommunity-based health services.\nBeverley Stringer, Health Policy\nand Practice Advisor at Medecins\nSans Frontieres (MSF), walked\ndelegates through some of these\nmodels. She presented ideas about\nwhat makes certain health models\nbetter than others, and why they\nshould be expanded in the future.\nMSF is a charity at the heart of\nthe humanitarian response to\nthe ongoing West African Ebola\nepidemic. The take-home message\nwas that despite the fragility of\ndeveloping countries\u2019 healthcare\nsystems, and the interrelation of\nhealth and economic prosperity, the\nSDGs unfortunately leave behind\nmany important global health issues.\nOther afternoon talks addressed\nthe importance of accountability,\ntransparency and effectiveness of\ncharities, prompting the question;\nwhere does my donation end up?\nThe Against Malaria Foundation\ntalk by Rob Mather (CEO), discussed\nthe hampering effect of theft,\nand the value of measuring and\nreporting in improving aid supply\nchain efficiency. He also caused a\nstir by attacking MDG programmes\nfor wasting funding on expensive\nprojects such as the Millennium\nVillage Project, which had limited\nimpact.\nCeleste Hicks, a freelance journalist,\nexplored some of the effects of\nChina\u2019s Imperialist agenda in Africa.\nSince 2009, it has been Africa\u2019s\nbiggest trade partner, with bilateral\ntrade of $210bn in 2013. However, it\nis unknown whether China has been\nexploiting the rich soil of Africa at\nthe expense of local African people\nfor its own need of oil, copper, iron\nore, cotton, coffee and other natural\nresources. China\u2019s influence on\nAfrica has significantly increased in\nrecent years, aided by the promise\nto Governments of economic\ndevelopment through infrastructure\nspending. Despite the efficiency\nwith which Chinese businesses can\nestablish schools, hospitals and roads,\nthere remains a concern; what benefit\ndoes it all have without operational\nfunding or sustainable legacy? \u201cJust\nbuilding stuff doesn\u2019t necessarily\npromote wider development\u201d.\nConcluding the day, Andrew\nLamb, former EWB-UK CEO and\nWorld Bank consultant, outlined\nthe concept of \u2018A Millennial\u2019 s\nDevelopment Goals\u2019. He focussed on\nhow Millennials, people born between\n1980 and 2000 (yep that\u2019s us), have\naccelerated development efforts,\nand are highly aware of global issues.\nThe importance of proper sanitation\n(good loos) was a key theme, and he\nsaid \u201cthere remain clear deficiencies\nin the ability of the MDGs to tackle\nbasic sanitary issues, which stunt\nimprovements to health in slums\nand areas where open defecation is\npracticed\u201d. Sewage systems have been\nimportant in building prosperous\ncivilisations through the ages (the\nRomans managed this ages ago\u2026),\nbut it is evident that many countries\nare growing so fast, and unequally,\nthat sanitation systems face severe\nbarriers to deployment.\nThe MDGs created a division in\nresponsibilities and contributions\nbetween developed and developing\ncountries. The new SDGs must call\non the actions and commitment\nto change of all countries and\ndevelopment actors. The post-2015\nprocess also runs the risk of being\nanother development fad or gimmick,\nsoon to be replaced by new thinking.\nThat danger can be limited if the\ngoals form an ongoing global compact\nspanning private sector investment in\naddition to government involvement\nand the UN, whose aim is sustained,\ncollaborative progress over the long\nterm.

This year the competition\nreturned to its original base of\nAmersham, Buckinghamshire and\nwith a record 44 teams and 151\ncompetitors, it was set to be a night to\nremember!\nAt 17:15, the RCC Exec set off from\nLondon with much moaning from\nStephen about how the minibuses\nwere so much worse to drive than a\nvintage fire engine\u2026\nThe team arrived at the base in\nAmersham at around 6, to set up\nthe registration and start desks and\nunload 150 people\u2019s worth of food\nfor breakfast from the minibus! The\nnight was very cold, with a clear starry\nsky, which meant the added benefit\nof a bright moon. At 19:00 the first\nteams began to arrive at the hall,\nready to venture out into the night\u2026\nThe competition starts when the\nteams are given their map: they then\nhave 6 hours to gain as many points\nas possible by visiting checkpoints\nworth varying numbers of points.\nThe checkpoints take the form of\nquestions, adding an extra difficulty\nof trying to find a specific answer\nin the dark! The first team out were\nThe Nocturnals at 19.36. From then\non there was a steady flow of teams\narriving and leaving. At 11.30 the last\nteam left and we were all able to grab\nan hour\u2019s sleep.\nDespite a few mishaps with blisters\nand low blood sugar involving\nminibus pick-ups, all teams\ncompleted the 6 hours and arrived\nback at the hall between 01:00 and\n0515, a little cold and tired but all\nthoroughly enjoyed themselves! Most\nteams tried to settle down and sleep\na little in the hall but by the time\nthe last few times had arrived back\nconditions were quite cramped!\nAt 05:00 the organising team began\nthe mighty task of cooking breakfast\nfor 150 people. This involved\nscrambling 300 eggs, cooking over\n200 slices of bacon and trying not to\nburn 60 tins of beans to the bottom\nof the pan. Plus the added pressure\nof 150 people getting more and more\nimpatient at the smell of food! And\nthat\u2019s before the even more mighty\ntask of the washing up.\nAfter breakfast the last item on the\nagenda was the prizegiving, the most\nexciting part of the night!\nFirst up was the best team name\nand most checkpoints visited, which\nwere won by Hike Milligan and The\nPerpetual Motion Squad respectively.\nNext up was the best fancy dress.\nRunners up were Matt\u2019s Bitcheeez\nbut the prize of \u00a320, trophy and\nchocolates went to The Spookies with\n\u2018spooky\u2019 pumpkin costumes including\nhats!\nNext up was the prize for the\nwinning team in the running\ncategory, which was taken by team\n\u2018You think you know it all, but you\njust don\u2019t\u2019 who beat Cunning Stunts\nto first place.

As with\nmost things,Imperial has a\nstrong reputational pedigree,\nhaving won the competition\nseven times,most recently two\nyears ago in Newcastle.\n2015\u2019s edition involved\nnineteen different sports,\nranging from conventional\nones such as 5-a-side football,\nbasketball and netball to non-conventional ones like laser\nquest,crazy golf and Quidditch\nwhich made its debut this year.\nThe eventual winners were the\nhosts with 60 points,leaving\nrunners-up Strathclyde in the\ndust with 24. Overall Imperial\ncame a creditable sixth; gaining\nfirst place in dodgeball,second\nin tennis and third in rounders\nand the sports day event.\nAfter the sporting activities\nand awards ceremony,held in\nthe Barclaycared Arena,were\nconcluded,the famous Frank\nMorton\u2019s afterparty celebrations\nbegan. The IC Crowd set about\nproving Imperial Chem Eng\nstudents can do more than just\nsize pumps,belting out 90s\nclassics from the likes of Spice\nGirls and S Club 7 with gusto.\nAs ever it was a fantastic event\nenjoyed by all who attended,\nproving tthat engineers really\ncan operate on very little sleep!\n2016\u2019s edition will certainly be an\nevent to look forward to.\nRICHARD GLOVER\nC&S WRITER\npoints, the highest score of the night!\nFinally was the hotly contested\nprize for the winning walking team.\nIn third place was \u2018Frolicking naked\nthrough a field\u2019 with 1200 points.\nSecond place went to \u2018the Rangers\u2019\nwith 1690 points.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 2\nFELIX 27.02.2015\nTravel Editor Yung Nam Cheah\nTravel\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nLost yourself in paradise alongside Aditya Narayanan in this paradise\nThe Unforgettable, amazing Oaxaca...\nHolidays in Mexico are\nstereotypically presented\nas being all about that\nbeach. From Cancun to Tijuana (and\nAcapulco), the golden sands and\nazure seas are well trodden by the\naverage foreign tourist. With glorious\nsunshine all year and relatively\ncalm and clear water, it is the perfect\nplace to laze about aimlessly for a\nweek or five. As it happens, this is\na rather mainstream opinion, and\nall have become the epitome of\nthe term tourist trap; a deluge of\nretirees looking for a lazy getaway\nand 20-somethings looking for a\nbacchanalian experience.\nThe counterpoint to this idea\nis Oaxaca, the capital city of the\neponymous state located in the\nmiddle of the Valles Centrales, a low\nmountain range forming a vertebral\nridge down the south of Mexico. For\na city that is not even in the largest 50\nin the country, it has had a surprising\npolitical influence, producing two of\nthe most notable presidents in the\nhistory of Mexico: Benito Juarez and\nPorfirio Diaz.\nThe former was without doubt\nthe most influential president of\nmodern Mexico. Apart from being\nthe first president of indigenous\nheritage, he achieved the separation\nof church from state affairs and\nwas a champion of equality for the\nindigenous people of Mexico. As\nyou can imagine, he is considered a\nhero. That the city also produced the\ncontroversial, authoritarian president\nDiaz (whose signature catchphrase\nwas \u201cpan o palo\u201d: bread or a beating),\nhowever, receives much less coverage.\nNevertheless, politics is not the\nreason Mexicans flood here \u2013 for one,\nit is a heaven for foodies.\nIt all starts with the mole.\nMole itself just means sauce in the\nNahuatl language, its most famous\nincarnation being the chocolate based\nmole poblano from the city of Puebla.\nBut Oaxaca is not content with just\none mole. To it, seven (yes, seven!) is\na much more suitable number. And\nthese sauces come in a tantalising\nvariety of colour and flavour. The\nmole amarillo is a light, sweet sauce\nmade using tomatillo, and resembles\na more flavourful tomato soup.\nWhile my personal favourite is\nthe thick, dark brown mole negro,\nwith the bitter hints of chocolate\ncomplementing a chilli kick and a\nsmoky aftertaste. The whole gamut\nis available in the Mercado 20 de\nNoviembre, a complex similar in\nconcept to the hawker centres in\nSingapore and Malaysia.\nUnfortunately a limited timeframe\nmeans I do not get to taste more than\ntwo moles, at least partly because\nOaxaca has far more to offer than\njust mole, as I find out to my delight\nan hour before taking the night\nbus out of the city. In the same\naforementioned food market, tucked\naway in a corner so nondescript that\nI only found it while looking for\nthe exit, is an isolated hall, tinged\na gloomy yellow from lighting\noverhead. Vendors line up to offer\nfresh meat and vegetables sold by\nweight and grilled before your eyes.\nSmoke and steam swirls around the\nroom, obscuring most of the action\nand adding to the air of seclusion and\nmystery. It is as if only those who are\nable to find this section are worthy\nof sampling what it has to offer,\nallowing the few lucky ones to leave\nwith the feeling of having found their\nown secret treasure.\nIt ends with chapulines.\nSmall, red and seemingly oblong,\nthey lie in mounds on carts at the\nroadside, having the appearance of\ndried red chillies. These are very\npopular amongst Mexicans, not to\nmention Oaxace\u00f1os: grasshoppers\nfried in a mix of chilli, salt and lime.\nIt takes me two days to muster the\ncourage to try\none, and the savoury crunchiness\nbrings to mind savoury trail mix.\nFor an instant I can see the appeal;\nthe popcorn-esque quality that\nallows one to absentmindedly\nmunch on for hours without concept\nof quantity. And then aftertaste\nhits me like a sledgehammer; an\nindescribable flavour I have never\nexperienced before, and still have\ntrouble wrapping my head round\nwhich requires several gulps of water\nto wash out. Although worth trying\nonce, I won\u2019t be going for a repeat any\ntime soon.\nFans of alcohol might also find it\ninteresting to know that the state\nof Oaxaca is the largest producer of\nmezcal in the country. Although\nmuch maligned as the poor cousin of\ntequila (a myth, for tequila is just a\nspecific kind of mezcal from the state\nof Jalisco), mezcal distilling culture\nhas experienced a huge upsurge over\nthe large few decades and is subject\nto the same rigour in its processing.\nNow, mezcalerias and production\nhouses are a frequent sight on side of\nthe highways, and show a refinement\nof flavour to rival a whisky or brandy\ndistillery. A stop in a distillery, many\nof which are family run enterprises\naround nearby Matatlan, can see\nyou sample as many as ten flavours\nranging including coffee cream, mint\nand the mysterious \u2018aphrodisiac\u2019.\nLeaving aside all the culinary\npleasures and intoxicants, Oaxaca\nitself is a picturesque, colonial town,\narranged in the square grid layout\ntypical of most North American\ntowns. Buildings are simple cuboids\nin Lego-brick colours of red, yellow,\nblue and green, with few elaborate\ntouches short of the occasional\nwrought iron window rail.\nThe main square (or Zocalo, as it is\ncalled here) is abuzz with the sound of\nbuskers crooning Mexican folk songs\nor participating in street theatre and\nyoung lovers taking advantage of the\nshaded areas to watch the world go\nby, seemingly oblivious to the forest\nof white tents marking the territory\nof yet another Occupy-style protest\nhappening in Mexico.\nWinding through the narrow,\ncrowded yet immaculate side streets\nbrings light to an area teeming with\ncontradictions. The rustic, simple\nView of a pool formed by spring at Hierve el Agua. Photo: Aditya Narayanan\nfacades of the store fronts disguise\nplush boutiques and hipster cafes,\nwhere artisanal gelato and luxury\nhandbags being sold either side of\nhole-in-the-wall Mexican street food!\nTrips to the surrounding region\noffer jaw dropping vistas and hikes\ninto the mountainous terrain are\npopular. Some indication of what\nto expect is available at the nearby\nruins Monte Alban, perched atop a\nhill overlooking Oaxaca city, where\nthe multi-coloured mat of the town\nbuildings offers a nice contrast to\nthe bottle green and dusty orange\nof the mountains. The jewel of the\nlandscape however, is Hierve el Agua.\nLooking at it feels like time has\ncome to a standstill, with a foaming,\nconvulsing body of water pouring\nover a cliff without actually moving.\nIt is thousand years of work of a\nheavily mineralised natural spring\nflowing gently over the wall of rock,\nmaking regular deposits to form\nstructures similar to stalactites.\nAbove the cliffs, small pools formed\nby the spring gleam a blue so bright\nit looks like a Pixar animation,\nwhile happy tourists take a dip in its\n\u2018healing waters\u2019.\nIn truth, I could have written four\nor five separate articles about Oaxaca\nat least, focusing on each of its fine\ncultural heritage, exquisite local\ncuisine, spectacular geography and\ngeneral ambience.\nI still feel a small tinge of regret I\ndid not spend longer than three days\nthere and I suspect even two weeks\nmay not have been enough to satisfy\nme. In hindsight though, perhaps this\nis a good thing, for now I have the\nperfect excuse to return.\nJust one of the many alternative stores in the city. Photo: Aditya\nNarayanan\n\n"

Richie approached him and\nasked what he was up to at the Union\ntonight. \u201cWe\u2019re all about the girls!\u201d\nthey cheered, before downing their\ndrinks.\nAn artists impression of how the night panned out.

Said the\nstudent sadly, \u201cI am running, but I\u2019ll\nbe in a category with some hot girls,\nso I don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m only really here with my two\nfriends because they want to meet\nKiss Craye.\u201d\nRichie hung around for another\nhour or two, although no-one\nrecognised that he wasn\u2019t a student,\nso simply left a bit later, undetected.\nHe went to Wagamamas afterwards,\nand recapped the evening.\n\u201cWell, I walked into the bar where\nall the sabbs drink without the\nsecurity saying anything to me.\n\u201cWom Theeler swore at me, but all\nin all, it was a fantastic success!\u201d\nAs the run up to the student\nelections continues, Hangman\ndecided to investigate\nwhy students are running for the\nhighly coveted sabbatical positions.\nHangman managed to hack into\nthe Union server, and chased down\nthose who had already nominated\nthemselves to find out why they were\nso desperate for that golden year\nworking for Imperial College Union.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m coming to the end of\nmy biology degree, and I don\u2019t see it\ngetting any better once I graduate,\u201d\nsaid one third year student, who\nis currently running for the role\nof Deputy President (Education).\nHangman interviewed them as they\nwere photocopying hundreds of black\nand white flyers, unaware of the\nobvious typo in her manifesto points.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of learning or\npodcasts or anything like that, but the\n19k wage is really tempting.\u201d\nHangman met up with a fourth\nyear Chemistry student, who\nwas struggling desperately with\nPhotoshop trying to remove some\nspots from their chosen photo.\n\u201cI thought it would be a great\nopportunity to do something\nworthwhile and really make a\ndifference at my Union,\u201d she pauses\nbefore cracking up. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\nkept a straight face whilst saying that!\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m staying around mostly\nfor the free accommodation; since\nthe hall rent prices went up, living in\nSouth Ken for another year without\nspending a penny is immense.\u201d\nHangman also spoke to a physics\nfirst year student, who was deciding\nbetween two different themes for\ntheir campaign. Whilst toggling\nbetween movie posters for The Wolf\nof Wall Street and Fight Club, he\nexplained why he was going for the\nrole of Deputy President (Welfare):\n\u201cMan, the rumours I\u2019ve heard about\nChris Kaye [the current DP(W)].\n\u201cDid you know that he once\nconvinced a whole subwarden team\nto let this student keep swords in his\nroom? That sort of power must be\nmental.\u201d\nFinally, hangman caught up\nwith a fourth year medical student,\nwho is considering running for\nUnion President. Whilst talking\nto Hangman, she was planning her\nsocial media campaign, complete with\na twitter profile, a Facebook page\nand a website too. All boasted a stark\npurple and yellow colour scheme.\n\u201cYeah, I think I can win, I mean,\nanyone could be President, so why\nnot me? I know this year\u2019s President\nis a white male, and I know last year\u2019s\nwas too, and the year before, and,\nwell, the year before that\u2026.and, what?\nThe year before that too?\u201d\nShe pauses, before continuing: \u201c\nNah, I\u2019m sure the students always\nvote for the most competent and\nqualified candidate,\n\u201cI don\u2019t think being a woman\nwill hold me back! Imperial is a\nreally open minded and supportive\ncommunity.\u201d\nShe shut her laptop, collected her\nbag and told us she was off to drink\nwith the rugby team. \u201cThey\u2019re nice\nlads really, they never have a sleazy\nword to say about women, not as far\nas I am aware anyway.\u201d\nHangman exclusive: students running for\nsabbatical roles have selfish motives\n\n"

Daland\u2019s crew shuffles\naround, clearing up after a storm as\nDaland announces that they will be\nheading home soon, and Senta, his\ndaughter, will be waiting for him.\nThis opening scene heralds the well-known tale of the Dutchman, who\nis bound to sail the seas for eternity\nunless a maiden swears to be true to\nhim; Senta, deeply moved by his fate,\nswears to follow him unto death.\nThis is a stormy story of love and\nobsession, fate and tragedy, and Tim\nAlbery\u2019s second revival of Wagner\u2019s\nmasterpiece fleshes it all out.\nRunning at two and a half hours with\nno interval, the production doesn\u2019t\nlet up. However, I did not notice the\ntime, captivated as I was by Andris\nNelsons\u2019 conducting of the beautiful\nmusic, that rises and falls like waves\nat sea.\nAdrianne Pieczonka\u2019s Senta was\nmagnificent, with a rounded, strong\nvoice that carried both the girl\u2019s\ndevotion and desperation to escape.\nHaving seen many favourable reviews\nof Bryn Terfel\u2019s Dutchman, I had\nbeen looking forward to seeing him\nlive but unfortunately, the Welsh\nbass-baritone was down with a cold\non the night I went and was replaced\nby Egils Silins who debuted with the\nRoyal Opera House as the Dutchman\nin 2011. Given that he apparently\nflew over to London at short notice,\nhis delivery was impressively smooth.\nFrom the beginning, right through\nto the last charged confrontation\nbetween the Dutchman and Senta,\nthe set is sensitive and mature \u2013 some\nropes here, a bridge there, a ladder\nin the corner \u2013 always sketching a\nscene without being too literal. That,\nand the masterful lighting were\ngreatly helpful in fleshing out the\npassions and the Dutchman\u2019s dark\nstruggle against his fate. For Silins\u2019\nDutchman, the desperation is clear,\nbut it is a measured desperation laced\nwith resignation to his fate.\nA delightfully energetic chorus\nalso supported the production; the\nfactory scene where the women\u2019s\nchorus sang in response to Senta\u2019s\nobsession with the ballad of the\nDutchman was a visual treat, while\none of the most gripping scenes was\nthe exchange between the crew of the\nghost ship and Daland\u2019s own crew.\nDaland\u2019s raucous, cheerful crew tried\nto be friendly with the dark, brooding\nghost crew, and what ensued was an\nimpressive coordinated choreography\nwith strong singing, highlighting\nthe ghost crew\u2019s anguish, as if the\nDutchman\u2019s tragedy had a physical\nmanifestation in his crew.\nThe last scene was somewhat\nperplexing, however, with Senta\nclutching a model ship and careering\nacross the stage, sobbing. In the\noriginal story, she throws herself into\nthe sea after the Dutchman as he sails\naway, thinking he was sparing her a\nterrible fate. That is the final act of\ndevotion and her word was proven\ntrue; the Dutchman is thus released\nfrom his curse and the two ascend\ninto the sky. Such a conclusion is the\nonly suitably dramatic end to such a\nstory, where despair is redeemed by\na final act of devotion. A hapless and\nmiserable Senta mourning her love at\na model ship just does not quite cut it.\nAt times brooding, at times\nlight-hearted and at times heart-wrenching, the Royal Opera House\u2019s\nDer Fliegende H\u00f6llander is an epic\njourney across both rough and calm\nseas, with passionate voices drifting\nin the wind, carried along by majestic\norchestral music.\nDer Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder was on at the\nRoyal Opera House 5th\n- 24th\nFebruary\nFRED FYLES &\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nThisweek\u2019seditionof FelixArts\nisfullofjourneys:journeys\nacrosstheseas,journeysintothe\nfuture,journeysintothepast,the\nnarrativeofchange.\nWestartwithJingjieCheng\u2019s\nreviewoftheRoyalOpera\nHouse\u2019sproductionofWagner\u2019s\nmasterpieceDiefliegende\nHoll\u00e4nder.This opera is the\ntrue meaning of a journey,a\nproduction with no interval,\nsimply one single narrative\nthat ebbs and flows across the\nwaves like the Dutchman\u2019s own\nvessel.In Tim Albery\u2019s second\nrevival of this work,he has\nmanaged to harness all of the\nturmoil,anguish and majesty of\nWagner\u2019s work,in what seems\nto be a production well worth\nseeing.\nNext,we are transported to\nthe near future in TheNether,\nDuke of York Theatre\u2019s new\nproduction,reviewed by Fred\nFyles.The piece takes us into the\nfuture of the Information Age,\nwhere its sinister side quietly\nemerges and the deepst depths\nof human nature are allowed to\nemerge from their abyss.\nPalestine.The early 21st\nCentury.Once again under\nbombardment.Fireworks\nexamines the daily realities\nof these besieged peoples,\nparticularly in how children,\nsome 60% of Gaza\u2019s population,\nrationalise this distorted world.\nAnd as madness envelopes\ntheir parents,they are left to\nunderstand the world in the only\nway they know,as if it is all a\nfantasy.\nFinally,Fred Fyles visits the\nTate Britain to review a duo\nof new shows that take us\non a journey into the past,to\nthe advent of photography\nin Britain in SaltandSilver\n1840-1860 and to the advent of\nthe industrialisation of art in\nSculptureVictorious,the story of\nscultpure in Victorian Britain.\nBoth are more historical reports\nthan anything else,exploring\nthe impact the tumultuous 19th\nCentury had on British art.\nTune in next week for the\n1600th\nissue of Felix,where the\nArts section shall feature as\npart of a larger Culture section\nalongside other sections such as\nFilm,Food,Fashion and Music.\nIt\u2019s going to be big!

    "content": "8 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n27.02.2015\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park and Jack Steadman\nJack Steadman reports on the events of\nHollywood\u2019s annual back-slapping party\nBirdman soars as Neil\nPatrick Harris falls flat\n\u201cTonight we celebrate\nHollywood\u2019s best and\nwhitest\u2026 sorry, brightest.\u201d\nSo began the 87th\nAcademy Awards,\nwith this year\u2019s ceremony hosted in\nthe Dolby Theatre by Neil Patrick\nHarris. A newcomer to the role of\nhost, Harris\u2019 first zinger was widely\nconsidered his best of the night \u2013\nonce the joy of his opening musical\nnumber faded, the laughs were a case\nof diminishing returns.\nIt wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying, either\n\u2013 Harris was bold enough to reenact one of the central scenes from\nBirdman (the night\u2019s biggest winner),\nappearing on stage in his tighty-whiteys for one skit.\nThere was a tame (and slightly\nnonsensical) jab at Harvey Weinstein\nbased off American Sniper, as well\nas the oh-so-predictable \u2018Reese\nWitherspoon is \u201cso lovely you could\neat her up with a spoon\u201d\u2019 quip.\nThere was nothing quite on the level\nof Ellen DeGeneres\u2019super-selfie last\nyear, or as acerbic as Seth MacFarlane\nthe year before. It was a weird\nhalfway-house, floating between\nshowtunes, snark, and sympathy,\nand it never quite worked. It was\nmore than a little odd to see such an\nunsteady performance from a man\nwhose hosting of the Tony Awards is\nalways a delight to see. Such is the way\nof the Oscars, it seems.\nThe uneven tone carried over to\nthe rest of the night as well, further\ncementing this as one of the weirdest\nOscar ceremonies for years.\nHarris\u2019 \u201cbest and whitest\u201d jibe was\nright on the money, acknowledging\none of the furores surrounding this\nyear\u2019s nominations: the complete\nsnubbing of not only Selma, the film\nof the 1965 Civil Rights march (and\nostensibly a Martin Luther King\nbiopic, although describing it thus\ndoes the film a disservice), but any\nactor of colour. All twenty of the\nacting nominees were white.\nIn the year after 12 Years a Slave,\nthe searing criticism of America\u2019s\npast, won Best Picture (and Best\nSupporting Actress, with a Best Actor\nnomination), a similarly important\nexamination of the country\u2019s sordid,\nmore recent history was almost\nentirely overlooked, bar a token Best\nPicture nod, in addition to one for\nBest Original Song.\nThe awards themselves continue\nto tiptoe that line between appearing\nprogressive and respectful, and\nexposing a darker, less appealing side\nto Hollywood. Selma did take home\nthe Best Original Song award, with\nthe artists responsible for the song\n(Common and John Legend) seizing\nthe opportunity \u2013 with both their\nperformance and their acceptance\nspeech \u2013 to turn the song into a real\nprotest.\n\u201cSelma is now,\u201d said Legend. \u201cWe\nlive in the most incarcerated country\nin the world. There are more black\nmen incarcerated today than were in\nslavery in 1850.\u201d The references to\nthe current protests in Ferguson were\na powerful statement, and didn\u2019t go\nunnoticed by the outside world \u2013 one\nof the main protest organisers in\nFerguson, Deray McKesson, described\nLegend\u2019s words as \u201ca one-person\nprotest.\u201d\nThere was another win for diversity\nin the shape of Birdman\u2019s repeated\nvictories. The Hispanic team behind\nthe film took home several of the big\nawards, including Best Picture, Best\nDirector and Best Cinematography,\nmaking this the second consecutive\nyear a Mexican director has taken\nhome the biggest prize in the\nprofession (after Alfonso Cuaron took\nhome Best Director for Gravity last\nyear).\nAll in all, a positive step forwards\nfor the Academy, but one that was\nalmost immediately stomped on by\na self-proclaimed liberal, Sean Penn.\nPresenting the award, Penn quipped\n\u201cwho gave this sonofabitch his green\ncard?\u201d\nA joke among old friends, perhaps,\nwith Penn having appeared in a 2003\nfilm by Inarritu, but still undeniably\nracist. It was an uncomfortable line\nto hear, and one that managed the\nunfortunate trick of immediately\nundercutting the success of non-whites.\nInarritu shrugged the line off,\nmaking his own joke on Mexicans\nwinning Best Director two years in a\nrow, before taking the chance to turn\npolitical.\nHe championed the rights of\nMexicans, both those resident\nin Mexico and those who have\nimmigrated to the US, proclaiming\nthat \u201cI hope that they can be treated\nwith respect of the ones who came\nbefore and built this incredible\nimmigrant nation.\u201d\nIt was a common theme on\nthe night, the use of acceptance\nspeeches to make powerful points.\nJ. K. Simmons was the first, urging\neveryone in the theatre and at home\nto call their parents \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t text,\ndon\u2019t email\u201d \u2013 and to \u201clisten to them\nfor as long as they want to talk to\nyou.\u201d It was a simple point, but a\nstrong one. And they only got better\nfrom there.\nPatricia Arquette used her speech\nfor Best Supporting Actress \u2013 the only\naward Boyhood took home on the\nnight, to everyone\u2019s mild surprise \u2013 to\npromote equality, proclaiming \u201cto\nevery woman who gave birth\u2026 it\u2019s our\ntime to have wage equality once and\nfor all, and equal rights for women\nof the United States of America!\u201d\nThe audience were on their feet, and\nrightly so.\nThe most notable speech to round\noff the night was Graham Moore\u2019s\nas he collected the prize for Best\nAdapted Screenplay. \u201cWhen I was\n16 years old I tried to kill myself\nbecause I felt different and that I\ndidn\u2019t belong,\u201d he revealed. \u201cNow\nI\u2019m standing here, and I want this\nmoment to be for that kid who feels\nweird or different\u2026 Stay weird, and\nthen when it\u2019s your turn, and you\u2019re\nthe one standing on this stage, please\npass this message on.\u201d Opinions about\nthe film aside, it was another strong\nmessage in a night that was full of\nthem.\nThe acceptance speech for\nCitizenFour, which took home Best\nDocumentary, was no exception,\nas director Laura Poitras thanked\nEdward Snowden, the documentary\u2019s\nsubject, for his \u201cdisclosures [that]\naren\u2019t only a threat to privacy, but\nto democracy,\u201d going on to credit all\n\u201cjournalists who are exposing truth.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 quip that Snowden \u201ccouldn\u2019t\nbe here for some treason\u201d sank like a\nparticularly wet balloon.\nOther award winners proved\nless dramatic or controversial in\ntheir speeches \u2013 Eddie Redmayne\u2019s\nspeech after winning Best Actor was\nadorable, but nothing special beyond\nhis dedication of the award to \u201call\nof those people around the world\nbattling ALS.\u201d\nJulianne Moore\u2019s Best Actress\nspeech was equally gracious,replete\nwith a quip about how, if winning\nan Oscar means \u201cyou live five years\n\"Harris\u2019\n\u201cbest and\nwhitest\u201d\njibe was\nright\non the\nmoney.\"\n\"Birdman\u2019s\nrepeated\nvictories\nwere a big\nwin for\ndiversity.\u201d\nSome of the big winners from this year\u2019s Acad\nBrig\nWhi\n\n"

    "content": "4 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n26.02.2015\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah, Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWith anger and uncertainty over the\nGovernment\u2019s immigration policy,\nPhilip Kent finds out what\u2019s going on.\nWhat\u2019s going on with\nstudent visas?\nAn influential group of MPs has\ncriticised the Government\u2019s\nstudent visa policy this week.\nIn a report published by the All-Party\nParliamentary Group on Migration,\nthe MPs argued for re-opening of the\n\u201cpost-study work route\u201d following\ngraduation.\nUp until 2012, international\nstudents could remain in the UK\nfor up to two years while searching\nfor another educational course (for\nexample, a Masters) or employment.\nFollowing the change, students\nhave only four months, meaning an\nImperial undergraduate whose course\nends in late June may remain in the\nUK until late October.\nThe group of MPs argued for this\nperiod to be extended to twelve\nmonths, in order to \u201c[maximise] the\nattractiveness of UK higher education\nin the face of an increasingly\ncompetitive international\nmarketplace\u201d.\nA decrease in the number of\ninternational students was felt to be\ndue to this change in how student\nvisas work, dropping by near 5,000\nbetween the years 11-12 and 12-13,\nalthough the numbers are now again\non the increase. There are currently in\nthe region of 300,000 students from\noutside the EU in UK universities.\nFormer vice-chancellor at the\nUniversity of East Anglia, Prof.\nEdward Acton, said that the Home\nOffice\u2019s policies have \u201cbutchered\u201d\nrelationships with India. Statistics\nfrom the Higher Education Statistics\nAgency found a 25% reduction in the\nnumber of Indian students during the\nyear 2012-13.\nImperial College Union\u2019s\nInternational Officer, Katherine\nChio, supported the proposal by the\nparliamentary group, telling Felix,\n\u201cBy extending the visa expiry date\nfrom four months after graduation to\none year, this could attract the most\nqualified international students to\nfurther study and work in the UK\nafter graduation, hence contributing\nto the UK\u2019s job market and economy.\u201d\nThe current government has a\npolicy to reduce the number of net\nmigrants into the UK below 100,000,\nthus motivating changes to the visa\nsystem. A motion was raised in the\nHouse of Commons by Labour MP\nPaul Blomfield, with backing by\nConservative MP Mark Field, and Lib\nDem MP Sir Andrew Stunell, calling\nfor students to be exempted from\nsuch a cap.\nMr. Blomfield said, \u201cFive\nparliamentary select committees\nhave urged the government to stop\nattacking students in its immigration\npolicy and handing the advantage to\nour international competitors\u201d.\nThis motion was backed by\nUniversities UK, the umbrella\ngroup for UK higher education\norganisations, and the Institute of\nDirectors. The University of Sheffield\nhas also publicly supported the early\nday motion on its website. This\nmotion is yet to be voted on by the\nHouse of Commons.\nMeanwhile, a group of business\nleaders including Baroness Lane-Fox\n(CEO of Lastminute.com) and Simon\nCollins (UK Chairman of professional\nservices firm KPMG) have written\na letter to the Financial Times,\nsimilarly calling on students to be\nremoved from immigration quotas.\nIn this letter, the businessmen\nand women say, \u201cWe do not want\nto lose these talented people to our\ncompetitor economies as a result\nof ill-thought-out immigration\npolicies.\u201d The letter also notes a poll\nby ICM for Universities UK and\nthink-tank British Future, which\nfound that 75% of respondents think\nthat international students should\nbe able to stay and work in the UK\nfollowing the completion of their\nstudies.\nMeanwhile, near 60% of\nrespondents think that international\nstudent numbers should not be\ncut, and around 80% think that\ninternational students do not count\nas immigrants at all.\nThe rhetoric against foreign\nstudents has worsened over the past\nfew years. In 2013, the Government\nannounced proposals to charge non-EU migrants a \u2018surcharge\u2019 upon entry\nto access the NHS, including students.\nThe charge, to be \u00a3150 for students,\nwill be brought into effect later this\nyear (see box).\nMeanwhile, last year Home\nSecretary Theresa May announced\nplans to completely ban international\nstudents from remaining in the UK\nimmediately following completion\nof their studies, unless the student\nhas work lined up. This proposal was\nraised because of fears of abuse of the\ncurrent system, whilst international\nstudent numbers were expected to\nincrease to around 600,000 by 2020.\nThe proposal has been criticised by\nthe Labour Party, university bosses,\nas well as business leaders including\nSir James Dyson who warns of \u201cdire\nconsequences for businesses\u201d.\nMay said there are no limits on\nthe number of students who can\ncome to the UK to study in a genuine\nacademic institution, and would not\nchange the policy for welcoming the\n\u201cbrightest and the best\u201d into the UK.\nShe indicated that the policy would\nappear in the Conservative Party\u2019s\nmanifesto for this May\u2019s election.\nHowever, shortly afterwards\nChancellor of the Exchequer George\nOsborne was reported to have killed\noff Ms. May\u2019s policy, according to\nthe Financial Times. A Government\nsource told the FT that it remains\npolicy to allow any foreign student in\na graduate-level job leave to remain\n\"The Home\nOffice\u2019s\npolicies have\n\u201cbutchered\u201d\nrelationships\nwith India.\"\n\"We do not\nwant to\nlose these\ntalented\npeople to our\ncompetitor\neconomies as\na result of ill-thought-out\nimmigration\npolicies.\"\nAre\ninternati\nstudents\nunder\nthreat?\nin the UK.\nFormer Universities minister,\nDavid Willets, told Radio 4 that\nMay\u2019s proposal was never party\npolicy, saying about the plan: \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink it was a good idea\u201d.\nOverall, Business Secretary Vince\nCable (Liberal Democrat) has warned\nthat the public debate regarding\nimmigration may damage the\n\u201ceconomically valuable\u201d recruitment\nof international students.\nWhilst the exact policy on student\nvisas is yet to be clarified, and will\ndepend quite significantly on what\nGovernment is formed following\nthis May\u2019s General Election, people\nstill have concern over the rhetoric\nconcerning international student\nvisas.\nChio was concerned that the UK\u2019s\npolicies may affect Imperial\u2019s global\nreputation. She told Felix, \u201cImperial\nis privileged to have the brightest\nstudents from all over the world to\nstudy here, in which the International\nstudents make up 1/3 of Imperial\u2019s\nstudent population. As the policies\non student visas will discourage\ninternational students from studying\nin the UK and hence in Imperial,\nit may affect Imperial\u2019s global\nreputation.\u201d\n\n"

So\nwithout further ado, let\u2019s bust some\nmyths.\nMyth: Only white rich teenage\ngirls get eating disorders\nI can\u2019t even fathom how this\none came about other than sheer\nignorance. Let\u2019s deconstruct and\ndebunk this with stats: eating\ndisorders affect up to 24 million\npeople of all races, cultures,\nethnicities, and socio-economic\nbackgrounds. It is estimated that\naround 10-15% of all the people with\nanorexia or bulimia are male, and\nthis is only on the lower end because\nmuch fewer men seek treatment for\neating disorders. This stereotype\ntends to cause people who don\u2019t fit\ninto the \u2018rich caucasian girl\u2019 mould\nto think they can\u2019t really be suffering\nfrom what they so clearly are, and it is\nso damaging because fewer and fewer\npeople feel like they have a valid\nreason to seek treatment and instead\nsuffering in silence.\nMyth: It\u2019s just about food\nThis one I understand. When\nsomething is called an eating\ndisorder, your first thought is going\nto be that as soon as someone just\ngets their eating in order, everything\nwill be fine, but that\u2019s not true.\nYes, developing and maintaining\nhealthy eating habits are essential\nto recovery, but they\u2019re not the only\nfactor involved. Eating disorders are\nall about compulsive behaviours and\nthinking patterns; a person with an\neating disorder can\u2019t just \u2018fix their\neating habits\u2019 and suddenly be okay,\nit\u2019s the underlying thought patterns\nthat control the eating in the first\nplace, and those need to be addressed\nso that the eating itself can be\nimproved. So please, think before you\ntell someone to \u2018just eat something\u2019.\nMyth: You can totally tell if\nsomeone is suffering from an\neating disorder by just looking at\nthem.\nFalse. The first thing to remember\nis that there are several types of\neating disorders, and all of them\nresult in different body types. What\u2019s\nmore is that not even the same type\nof eating disorder cause the same type\nof differences in body types. In fact,\nmany people who suffer from eating\ndisorders are of normal (medical)\nweight, yet suffer from things like\nbulimia.\nMyth: People with eating disorders\nare just shallow and have chosen to\nbehave the way they do.\nAs with all mental illnesses,\nyou don\u2019t just wake up one day\nand choose to have them. It is a\ngradual process, often influenced\nby countless different factors. It\nusually arises from several different\nlife events which are in some way\nassociated with eating and body\nimage. Eating disorders are a result\nof societal influence, personal stress\nand triggers, and sometimes even\ngenetics. There is no one reason why\nsomeone develops an eating disorder,\nand it certainly isn\u2019t out of a lifestyle\nchoice.\nMyth: Eating disorders are just a\ncry for attention, or a phase, and\nthey\u2019ll go away on their own.\nI cannot stress enough how much\nthis isn\u2019t true! As I mentioned\nbefore, eating disorders are serious\nmental health issues and need to be\ntreated as soon as they\u2019re detected\nand by medical intervention. Eating\ndisorders have the highest mortality\nrates out of all mental illnesses\nbecause of the severe adverse physical\neffects that accompany them, making\nthem the most dangerous. They can\nresult in heart and organ failure,\nosteoporosis, and malnutrition\namong a cornucopia of other\nconditions. Because of this myth,\nonly 1 in 10 people suffering from\neating disorders seek treatment, and\nonly 35% of those receive treatment\nspecially catered towards their\ncondition.\nMyth: Eating disorders are for life\nand cannot be treated.\nIf you take one thing away\nfrom this article, it should be this:\nAlthough recovering from an eating\ndisorder takes time and effort, it is far\nfrom impossible. There are various\nfacilities available to help people\nwith eating disorders through their\nrecovery process, and when given\nproper treatment, over 80% of people\nmake at least a partial recovery.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 7\nFELIX 27.02.2015\nPolitics Politics Editor Joshua Renken\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cWorst party leader interview ever\u201d\nTories and Labour ridiculed and\ncondemned before the election but\nwe\u2019ve actually been able to do this. We\nreally emphasised the environment\nby introducing for example the green\ninvestment bank. We\u2019ve provided\nalso a huge break on numerous\nConservative policies. The most\nextreme are things like abolishing\nbasically all employment rights,\nallowing companies to fire people at\nwill. Basically totally privatising the\nNHS. So really it\u2019s pretty remarkable\nwhat we\u2019ve prevented the Tories from\ndoing and also what we\u2019ve managed\nto achieve given that we have a fifth\nas many MPs as the Tories and no\ngoverning experience before the\ncoalition.\nGenerally speaking when people\ndiscover how much we\u2019ve achieved\nthey are willing to give us a lot of\ncredit. We\u2019ve done this in the face\nof an almost unanimously hostile\nmedia, a very hostile Labour Party\nand generally in bad circumstances.\nThere are however a couple of things\nwere we haven\u2019t been successful.\nJR: How can students trust your\nparty again after the broken\npromise on university tuition fees?\nRMG: First of all many Lib Dem MPs\nabstained and secondly the change in\ntuition fees is not actually the kind of\natrocity that it was depicted as.\nLet\u2019s look at what the other two\nparties were saying; The Tories\nwanted to take the cap off tuition fees.\nBasically privatise the whole thing.\nIf you look at what Labour actually\nsaid before the election, they said\nat minimum they would want to be\nhaving at minimum a much, much\nlarger cap than \u00a39000. Lib Dems\nchanged the amount you have to earn\nbefore you pay it back so that it\u2019s not\nvery much at all. I know this because\nI\u2019ve done it. So frankly the deal that\nwe actually got was really very good.\nBut most MPs were going after even\nmore generous loans. And like I said\nwe\u2019ve introduced postgraduate loans\nin the most recent budget.\nLabour had the opportunity for\nthirteen years and they didn\u2019t even\ncare. The Tories certainly don\u2019t care.\nThis is very much what we\u2019re doing so\nI think our record on student issues\nhas been pretty positive.\nAnd by the way I certainly wouldn\u2019t\nhave voted for the change in tuition\nfees because I think that higher\neducation should be free.\nJR: Why do you think the Lib\nDems are doing so poorly in the\nopinion polls?\nRMG: Very simple. The simple fact\nof being in government. It literally\ndoesn\u2019t matter who with. That is\neasily enough to lose us a huge chunk\nof our support.\nBasically a lot of people voted for\nbefore the coalition us just because\nwe were the default opposition party.\nAnd I think the simple fact of losing\nthat is responsible of two thirds of the\nsupport that we\u2019ve lost at least. I mean\nI\u2019m not denying we\u2019ve made mistakes,\nor that the party leadership has made\nmistakes. But I mean, come on. We\nwere considered a protest party. And\nwe don\u2019t want to be.\nJR: What do you think of our\nposition in the EU?\nRMG: The Lib Dems ran very strong\npro-EU campaign in the European\nelections and we were the only party\nto do so at all. And I\u2019m very pleased\nwith that because the EU is basically\na very good thing. It gives us vast\ninfluence across the world, which\nwe otherwise wouldn\u2019t have, and it\nallows favourable trading systems to\nbe developed. My problem with the\nLib Dem election campaign was that\nwe didn\u2019t talk about reforming the\nEU because it is deeply undemocratic.\nIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s no democracy\nthere but we should be electing the\ncommission as well as parliament.\nReally I would say the EU is a good\nthing but we need to reform it.\nJR: And our immigration policy?\nRMG: On immigration, I want to\nchange the system so that we are\nthinking about who is coming in not\nwhat country they are from. And that\nmeans that Imperial students can\ncome in easily.\nJR: If you could scrap any law or\npolicy which one would you go for?\nRMG: I would just say we\u2019re not going\nto support countries such as Saudi\nArabia, which is a flat out theocratic\nterror state that kills its own people.\nIf we scrapped these sorts of foreign\nalliances I think this would send a\nstrong sort of message to the world.\nJR: Do you think age matters\nwhen you become a member of\nparliament?\nRMG: I think it\u2019s important to\nhave as broad a range as possible in\nparliament.\nThat also means having more old\npeople in parliament.\nJR: Favourite columnist?\nRMG: Peter Oborne.\nJR: Favourite newspaper?\nRMG: The Guardian.\nJR: What was the last work of\nfiction you read?\nRMG: \u2018The Gun Seller\u2019 by Hugh\nLaurie\nJR: Favourite Book?\nRMG: Probably \u2018The Road To Wigan\nPier\u2019 by George Orwell\nJR: Are you religious?\nRMG: No. Complete atheist.\nJR: House of Cards or West Wing?\nRMG: House of Cards\nJR: Favourite current Lib Dem MP?\nRMG: Julian Huppert\nJR: Favourite MP who isn\u2019t a Lib\nDem?\nRMG: William Hague\nJR: In the latest QS world\nuniversity rankings Imperial\nCollege was joint second with\nCambridge, while Oxford was\na frankly abysmal fifth place.\nThat said, do you prefer the term\n\u2018Impbridge\u2019 or \u2018Camperial\u2019?\nRMG: Good question. I think\n\u2018Camperial\u2019 sounds better.\nThe leader of the Green Party\nNatalie Bennett has apologised\nto party members after an\n\u201cexcruciating\u201d radio interview on\nLBC concerning one of its policies on\nhousing.\nIn part of the Greens\u2019 election\ncampaign launch, Ms Bennett failed\nto explain how the party would be\nable to fund their pledge to create half\na million new council homes.\nShe told Nick Ferrari that the\npolicy would cost just \u00a32.7 billion,\nwhich prompted the LBC presenter to\nask:\u201cFive hundred thousand homes\n\u2013 \u00a32.7bn? What are they made of \u2013\nplywood?\u201d. Ms Bennett insisted the\npolicy was \u201cfully costed\u201d but struggled\nto explain where the money would\ncome from or provide the figures to\nback up her claims.\nNatalie Bennett, who was elected\nto her position as the leader of the\nGreen Party of England and Wales in\nSeptember 2012, could not respond to\nNick Ferrari\u2019s questions surrounding\nthe costs of the policy.\nThe party, which currently has\none MP in the House of Commons\n(Caroline Lucas), has several striking\npolicies including the introduction of\na \u201ccitizen\u2019s income\u201d of \u00a372 a week for\nall adults.\nThe Green Party has enjoyed a\nmembership surge to 55,000 in recent\nmonths (more than the Lib Dems\nor Ukip) and is currently polling on\naround 8% of the vote. The success of\nthis left wing party has been much to\nThe \u201cexcruciating\u201d interview with Green Party Leader Natalie Bennett\nthe detriment of Labour\u2019s chances of\nwinning a majority at the upcoming\ngeneral election.\nLabour has publicly questioned\nMs Bennett\u2019s grasp of policy but in\nresponse to the recent criticism over\nher poor interview she explained\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to Green Party\nmembers that I didn\u2019t do a good job\nat representing our policies. That\nhappens, I\u2019m human. One can have a\nmental brain fade on these things.\u201d\nIn a subsequent Sky News interview,\nthe leader of the Greens said: \u201cI\u2019ve\nspent the last two and a half years\ntalking about our policies and the\nanswer is to face up to one\u2019s mistakes\nand move on.\u201d\nPerhaps Natalie, next time just\ngo for \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have the\nfigures?\u201d\n\"The\nchange in\ntuition\nfees is not\nactually\nthe kind\nof atrocity\nthat it was\ndepicted\nas.\"\n\"Really I\nwould say\nthe EU\nis a good\nthing but\nwe need to\nreform it.\"\nNatalie Bennett has had a rough few days.

    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n27.02.2015\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park and Jack Steadman\nDon\u2019t call me maybe\nSleeping with the wrong person\ncan have all sorts of bad\nconsequences. The best example\nof this is what Dan Gallagher\n(Michael Douglas) had to go through\nfor a one-night stand with cinema\u2019s\nmost chilling woman scorned, Alex\nForrest (Glenn Close) aka the \u201cbunny\nboiler\u201d in Fatal Attraction. Jennifer\nLopez\u2019s new film, The Boy Next Door\nessentially tells the same story, but\nthis time the gender roles have been\nreversed. Jenny from the Block is\nClaire, the recently separated highschool English literature teacher who\neyes, plays with, and then tosses aside\nher hunky new neighbour, Noah\n(Ryan Guzman), who also happens to\nbe a student at her school.\nThey first meet when she struggles\nto open her garage door. Enter Noah,\nor more specifically, a close-up shot\nof his toned arm, giving her support.\nHe befriends her, her son Kevin (Ian\nNelson), and a few days later, Claire\nhas her very own Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s\n\u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 moment, staring\nout her window seeing her eye candy\nhard at work with gritty manual\nlabour. And good news for her is that\nunlike the hit music video, Noah is\nstraight and is eyeing her back. It does\nnot take long for the two to spend a\nsteamy night together, and for Claire\nto realise that she has in fact made a\nmistake.\nThere is a fair amount of cringe-worthy moments to be had in what\nare supposed to be the sweet and\ntender scenes of the two characters\ninitially falling for each other. It all\ncomes across as painfully awkward\nthat in the end you start wondering\nwhere things will start going wrong\nfor the couple. The lingering stares,\nall the uncomfortable touching,\nand disjointed conversations all\ncontribute to unintentional hilarity,\nwith the prize-winning moment\ngoing to the scene in which Noah\ngives Claire the first edition of\nHomer\u2019s \u2018The Iliad\u2019, which basically\ncannot actually exist in such an intact\nform. Way to ruin a moment, writers.\nBut then the obsessive behaviour\nbegins. It turns violent and overtly\nsexual, with Noah truly revealing his\ncolours as a complete psychopath\nrelentlessly stalking and harassing\nClaire, both at her home and her\nworkplace. Kudos to Lopez who plays\nthe victim role well, but the film\nstruggles to find a convincing villain\nin Noah with Guzman. He is helped\nby the occasionally explicit nature of\nhis dialogue, (him facing off against\nClaire\u2019s best friend, the high-school\u2019s\nvice principle (Kristin Chenoweth),\nis particularly amusing) but Guzman\nhimself cannot seem to come across\nas a menacing figure. The scorned\nman talks the talk and finds creative\nnew ways to torment the woman\nwho will not reciprocate his feelings,\nincluding the threat of a secretly\nfilmed sex video, revenge porn\nlaws be damned. But threatening is\nsomething he does not even come\nclose to achieving; not even a tenth\nof how Glenn Close chilled an\nentire generation with her volatile\nvillainess.\nIt all comes together to a ridiculous\nclimax surrounded by flames in\nwhich our heroine fights for her dear\nlife, whilst trying to save her son,\nas well as her estranged, cheating\nhusband. If there is ever an epi-pen\nlying around to be used as a weapon,\nit will be sure to use it in the most\neffective way possible, as shown in\nthe film\u2019s rather gratifying end. The\nBoy Next Door delivers exactly what it\npromises to do on the surface. It is a\ntrashy thriller, sometimes with little\nlogic involved, but in that there is\nsimple, laid-back fun to be had for the\nfilm\u2019s relatively short running time.\nAlong with some gratuitous nudity\nand thrusting for anyone who wishes\nto see it.\nTHE BOY NEXT DOOR\nDirector: Rob Cohen\nScreenplay: Barbara Curry\nCast: Jennifer Lopez, Ryan\nGuzman, Kristin Chenoweth,\nJohn Corbett\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: Rob Cohen, Universal Pictures\nPhoto: BBC\nPhoto: Telegraph\nSAVAGE GRACE\nDirector: Tom Kalin\nScreenplay: Howard A.\nRodman\nCast: Julianne Moore, Eddie\nRedmayne, Hugh Dancy\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nCongratulations are in order for\nEddie Redmayne and Julianne\nMoore for their very deserving\nOscar wins last Sunday night. But did\nyou know that back in the day, when\nRedmayne was starting out in the\nfilm industry, and when Moore was\ngetting snubbed by the Academy on\nmultiple occasions, they the two of\nthem starred in a film together?\nReleased all the way back in 2008,\nMoore plays Barbara Daly Baekeland,\na New York socialite who gets up to\nno good with her schizophrenic son\nAntony (Redmayne). And by \u201cno\ngood\u201d, we are talking about some\nseriously twisted psychological issues\nhere.\nMoore and Redmayne, as can\nbe expected, give committed\nperformances, and make the odd,\nuncomfortable subject matter\nsomewhat bearable, and the film is no\nshort on delivering shocks. The film\nis bold in venturing to explore the\nchilling nature of their relationship,\nand you begin to wonder just how this\nsordid tale will end.\nAnd yet the film rarely succeeds\nin connecting all the dots. The plot\nbarely skims through the many years\nshared between the two characters\nin frantic time-jumps, and to call the\nstory a superficial glance would be\nan understatement. This could have\nworked as a TV mini-series. But as a\nfilm? Barely scrapes the surface.\nPhoto: Tom Kalin, IFC Films\n\n"

    "content": "30 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n16.01.2015\nC & S Editor Ben Howitt\nClubs and Societies\nfelix.clubsandsocieties@imperial.ac.uk\nMarcus Bishop reviews the key themes and outcomes of the\nLondon International Development Conference\nInternational Development in a\nChanging World\nAt the Millennium Summit in\nSeptember 2000, the largest\ngathering of world leaders in\nhistory adopted the UN Millennium\nDeclaration, committing their\nnations to a new global partnership\nto reduce extreme poverty and\nsetting out a series of time-bound\ntargets, with a deadline of 2015,\nthat have become known as the\nMillennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). Now we\u2019ve hit 2015, the\nLondon International Development\nConference (IDC) asked what\nprogress has been made, and more\nsignificantly, how can the global\ndevelopment agenda adapt to address\na different set of challenges?\nThe world has changed greatly\nduring the last 15 years. Dramatic\nevents, including unprecedented\nnatural disasters in part linked to\nclimate change, the Great 2007\nRecession and Arab Spring, have\nchanged the course of global\nprogress in unanticipated ways and\ndemonstrated the unreliability\nof established economic models\nand political assumptions. A new\nand more balanced global order\nis emerging. Divides between\ndeveloped and developing countries\nare lessening, as many formerly\nunderdeveloped countries move up\nthe economic ladder. Global demand\nfor natural resources is increasing,\nin some cases beyond the capacity\nof the environment to replenish\nitself or absorb the impacts of our\nanthropogenic activities.\nIt is clear that the 8 MDGs did\nactually galvanise action to support\ndevelopment. Global poverty has\nbeen halved five years ahead of\nthe 2015 timeframe. Ninety per\ncent of children in developing\nregions now receive primary\neducation, and disparities between\nboys and girls in enrolment have\nnarrowed. Remarkable gains have\nalso been made in the fight against\nmalaria and tuberculosis, along\nwith improvements in all health\nindicators. The likelihood of a child\ndying before age five has been nearly\ncut in half over the last two decades.\nThat means that about 17,000\nchildren are saved every day. We\nalso met the target of halving the\nproportion of people who lack access\nto improved sources of water.\nThe MDG framework has however\nbeen criticised, mainly for what it\nhas omitted. Critics argue that the\ngoals do not place enough emphasis\non sustainable development, and are\na minimalist interpretation of the\nmillennium declaration\u2019s spirit and\nambition, leaving out crucial issues\nsuch as peace and security.\nThe London IDC kicked off with\nHilary Stauffer, former Geneva\nDiplomat and Fellow at LSE, who\nexamined the important intersections\nof Development and Human Rights.\nHilary started by saying \u201cNobody\ncan agree whether the \u2018right to\ndevelopment\u2019 is a reasonable request\nare obsessed with the macro level\nof things (treaties, conventions,\ndiplomacy), and get so caught up in\nthe details they forget there are real\npeople that are the subject of these\ninternational legal instruments.\n\u2018Human rights\u2019 people think that\n\u2018Development\u2019 people are only\nconcerned with the micro level of\nthings (poverty alleviation projects,\nclean water initiatives) and get so\ncaught up in the details they forget\ngovernments move slowly and are\ngenerally tight-fisted.\nSo the question is, who is right?\nWhat is the point of having another\ntreaty that doesn\u2019t solve anything?\nWhy has ~70 year of aid in Africa\nfailed to deliver proper clean water\nsystems for millions? Essentially, we\nhave a lot to learn from each camp,\nand we shouldn\u2019t think rigidly about\nthe most effective means of achieving\ndevelopment goals. It is important to\nconsider the benefits of international\ncoalitions for delivering positive\nfrom poor countries for a helping\nhand, or a naked money grab that\nallows them to put off real reform\u201d.\nHilary framed a debate which\nidentified two distinct schools of\nthought around this intersection.\nThe Human Rights Power Structure\nin Geneva is a much more natural\nhome for the geo-political West, as\nthey understand that language and\nsensibilities that go along with the\nidea of \u201chuman rights,\u201d and generally\nbelieve that if you have good\ngovernance, economic development\nwill eventually come. In contrast, the\nDevelopment Power Structure in New\nYork is a much more natural home\nfor the geo-political Global South,\nas they understand the language\nand sensibilities of \u201cdevelopment\u201d\nand generally believe that a baseline\nlevel of economic development is a\npre-requisite for the \u201cluxury\u201d of good\ngovernance.\n\u2018Development\u2019 people tend to\nthink that \u2018Human rights\u2019 people\nThe London International Development conference took place on the 7th\nFebruary, 2015.

First up on the track was\nfresher Alex Mundell swapping the\nmud and rain of cross country for the\nfast dry track. A strong performance\nsaw her finish third in the strongest\nof the three heats bagging a fastest\nloser spot in the final on Sunday.\nNext up was the mens\u2019 400m with\ntwo Imperial athletes taking part.\nLuke Butler narrowly missed out on\na semi-finals spot before the captain\nGareth Holden set a new PB of 52.29s\non his way to qualifying for the semifinals on Sunday morning.\nWhile all this was happening on\nthe track Emma Watkins was putting\nin a solid performance in the long\njump and Erik Tropp was again\nentertaining in the pole vault after\nan adventure getting his 14ft pole\naround Sheffield (many thanks to\nJudo for offering their minibus).\nUnable to recreate his amazing\nSESSA form he still impressed with\na leap of 3.60m. And last but by no\nmeans least in the field Shivam Patel\nmixed it with the big boys at the shot\nputt.\nThen came the main event, the\none we had all been waiting for:\nthe mascot race. Imperial had two\nentries: the majestic Albert the Lion\nand the homemade and much loved\nCasper the Casio Calculator each\ncontributing \u00a325 to Marie Curie\nCancer Care. Albert started with a\nstumble and never really recovered\nbut a late burst from Casper saw\nhim overtake Liverpool\u2019s Lenny the\nLiverbird in the home straight to\nfinish 10th in what was by far the\nmost hilariously entertaining race of\nthe weekend.\nThe afternoon saw the 4x200m\nteam of Gareth Holden, Sidney Chan,\nEdrea Pan and James Roughneen take\nto the track. Despite some impressive\nrunning (albeit with an unnecessary\ndetour via lane 6) the team was\ndisqualified for a mystery changeover\ninfringement.\nThe tiring and impressive results\nfrom the day meant only three were\nleft standing for the \u201cbig night out\u201d\nwho found out that Northern clubs\nare decades behind London not only\nwith their prices but their music\nchoices too.\nThe next morning it was the turn of\nthe 200m runners with Ines K\u00fcbler\ngetting the team under way closely\nfollowed by James Roughneen and\nEdrea Pan all three of whom put in\nstrong performances but were unable\nto make the semis.\nSunday afternoon brought the\nweekend\u2019s elite performances.\nPutting in a true captain\u2019s\nperformance Gareth Holden ran a\nblisteringly quick 51.68s to smash\nhis PB yet again, taking more than\na second off his pre-BUCS time.\nUnfortunately it was not enough to\nprogress in what was an outrageously\nstrong 400m field but he can\ncertainly be proud of his last indoor\nperformance for the team and his\ntime as Imperial athletic captain as a\nwhole.\nFinally came the other big race\nof the weekend: ICSM fresher Alex\nMundell in the final of the 1500m.\nThe race got off to a very slow start\nwith no one looking like they wanted\nto take it out, but at the half way\npoint the favourite turned up the\nheat, slashing the lap times to string\nout the field.\nAlex reacted well giving it her all\nand was chasing down third when\nshe hit the wall in the final lap to slip\nback to eighth but still pick up the all\nimportant final BUCS point.\nWe hope she continues to shine in\nathletics during her next five years at\nImperial.\nDespite numerous cancelled trains\nand frantic train swapping under\nthe command of our own public\ntransport expert and calculator-costumed athlete, we managed to all\nreach London to keep on laughing at\nvideos of the mascot race over and\nover and over again.\nWant to get involved in more\nAthletics with the London College\nAthletics Series open to all abilities at\nthe end of March?\nEmail run@ic.ac.uk or find us on\nFacebook.\n\n"

Our top two batters eventually\ncame round to score, and despite two\nquick outs, Sheffield were unable to\nshut down the Imperial offense, as\nthey tacked on another run in the\ninning. The Hornets fought back in\nthe bottom of the inning, but could\nnot sustain the pressure after some\ntight fielding and a bad call by their\nbase coach.\nAfter two of the first three Falcons\nbatters were struck out, the Imperial\noffense came back strongly. Some\nwayward Sheffield pitching and some\ngood hitting (particularly a double\nby second baseman Rhys) scored five\nruns for the Falcons, with the innings\nending after the mercy rule kicked\nin. Once again, the Sheffield offense\ncould not find its groove in the\nbottom of the inning, as Zack added\ntwo more strikeouts to his tally for\nthe game.\nAfter rookie right-fielder\nHridayarth drew a walk and Stephane\ngot on base with a hit, it looked like\na final flourish was on the cards.\nUnfortunately, Imperial couldn\u2019t\ncontinue their good run of batting,\nalthough it wasn\u2019t necessary as the\nFalcons started the bottom of the last\ninning already up by nine runs. Some\ngood pitching and a fantastic sliding\ncatch by replacement catcher Marcel\n(either that or he\u2019d had enough of\nstanding up) meant that Sheffield\ncouldn\u2019t even get on base, as Zack\nstruck out the last batter to end the\ngame 10-1 to Imperial.\nAfter a long break in the warm, dry\nstudents\u2019 union, Imperial returned\nto face the UEA Blue Sox, expecting\na much tougher test than what we\u2019d\nfaced earlier. This proved to be the\ncase as Imperial failed to score in the\nfirst inning, as our offense didn\u2019t\nfire, and our aggressive base-running\ndidn\u2019t pay off. The Falcons kept UEA\nto only three runs in the bottom\nof the inning, however, as pitcher\nEdoardo struck out two Blue Sox\nbatters.\nThe UEA defence was just as\nmiserly in the first inning, as they\nbrought on the same pitcher that\nhad frustrated the Falcons so much\nduring the Fall Cup. The next two\nbatters struck out, followed by\na fly-put to end the inning after\nStephane was hit in the hand by a\nfastball (and now has one hand twice\nas big as the other). The Blue Sox\nthen batted round in the bottom off\nthe innings to go 7-0 up, after some\nstrong hitting, despite some accurate\npitching by Edoardo.\nAs in the Fall Cup, Imperial started\nto fight back in the third inning, as\na hit from first-baseman Ben set up\nright-fielder Chris for an RBI single\nThe first two games yielded mixed results Photo: IC Baseball\nChris Carter reports from the first ever M1 Series Tournament\nSilver medals for the Imperial Kendo Club\nVictory slipped through\nImperial\u2019s grasp in the Kyu\ngrade tournament finals\nagainst the first team from Kent\nUniversity, losing in a tie-break\nmatch. Imperial team ended only\nwith silver medals in the end.\nThe match was nail-bitingly close\nand the hall was filled with the sound\nof cheering crowd and contestants\u2019\nshouting with every hit as a part of\nKendo\u2019s spirit. Imperial pulled ahead\nfrom Kent with a win after draws\nfrom the first two members of the\nteam. Soon however, Kent managed\nto catch up with a win in the final\npair, resulting in an overall draw.\nA daihyosen (a tie-breaker between\nrepresentatives from each team) was\ncalled to decide a winner and Ed Ying\nwas picked to fight for the Imperial\nteam as he had beaten his opponent\nin his personal match. His opponent\nfor the daihyosen, Ed Pollard, was\nthe gold medalist in the individuals\ntournament and Imperial\u2019s Ed\nunfortunately lost to a men (head)\ncut.\nIn addition to the medals from the\nteam competition, Ed Ying also won\na bronze medal for the Kyu grade\nindividuals competition, losing to\nhis rival, Ed Pollard, who had beaten\nhim in the daihyosen. Jason Li won\nan award and a new shinai (kendo\nsword) for his display of fighting\nspirit, shouting down more than a few\nopponents.\nThe Imperial second team, on the\nother hand, didn\u2019t manage to go\nfar into the tournament. The team\ngrinded to a halt in the second round\nwhen they had to go against Imperial\nfirst team. In this battle of brothers,\nImperial 2 was eliminated, paving\nthe way for Imperial 1 to go further\nahead.\n\u201cThey were probably scared of\nImperial teams. That\u2019s why the\ntournament structure pitched us\nagainst each other.\u201d This was the\ngeneral sentiment among the club\nmembers.\nThe University Taikai (tournament)\nconsisted of 12 teams from various\nuniversities and the competition\nitself was further divided into\nindividuals and teams tournaments\nfor Kyu (novice) and Dan (advanced)\ngrade divisions. The team\ncompetition format was a sequence\nof five 1v1 fights where the results\nof each are combined for an overall\nscore.\nYoshikawa-sensei, coach and teacher\nof the Imperial Kendo club, said\nthat coming second was a bit sad,\ngiven that we were in the lead for\nthe majority of the match. It was a\ncombination of many mistakes that\ncould have been avoided.\nLast year, Imperial came third in the\nUniversity Taikai. As Imperial came\nsecond this year, Alan Su, the club\ncaptain, was confident that this is just\na pit stop before reaching first place\nnext year.\n\u201cThe victory train is slow but\ninevitable,\u201d he said.\nThe next year\u2019s competition will\ntake place in the Ethos gym where\nImperial is the host. Being on home\nturf should help make the victory\ntrain reach its destination smoothly.\nIn the week before the University\nTaikai, the club was visited by\nShigakukan University who came\nfrom Japan to host training sessions\nfor the Imperial club and the British\nKendo team. The Japanese students\nCHANON\nWONGSATAYANONT\nIMPERIAL KENDO\nto bring home the Falcons\u2019 first run.\nThe Imperial defence tightened up\nin the bottom of the innings, holding\nthe Blue Sox to a single run as Zayd\nmade a fantastic catch in right field.\nThe Falcons were tentatively hopeful\ngoing into the final inning, as the\nstar pitcher from UEA was replaced.\nUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t to be, as the\nImperial rally didn\u2019t quite come after\ntwo fly-outs ended the inning. The\nFalcons\u2019 fielding was tight in the\nbottom of the inning, although by\nthis time we had turned to damage\nlimitation as the game was over, with\nthe Blue Sox running out 8-1 winners.\nThe remainder of the tournament will\nbe in next week\u2019s sport section.\ntook the time to train with Imperial\nclub members and their sensei\nimparted valuable lessons, which\nhelped the club gain an edge in the\nUniversity Taikai. The club would\nlike to give thanks to the Shigakukan\nUniversity and British Kendo team\nfor their cooperation.\nThe moment Imperial hearts were broken in the tie-breaker\nPhoto: IC Kendo\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 21\nFELIX 27.02.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFred Fyles explores the Victorians\u2019 love for statues at Tate Britain\nThe sculptural legacy of an empire\nAn empire can be measured not\nby the length of its borders,\nor by the riches of its lands,\nbut by the quality of its sculptures.\nAt least, this is what the Tate Britain\nis trying to argue, with its newest\nexhibition Sculpture Victorious, an\node to the golden age of British\nsculpture. Actually, perhaps that first\nsentence should be amended to read\n\u201cthe quantity of its sculptures\u201d, since\nit was during the Victorian era that\nthe country experienced a surge in\nsculpture production, unprecedented\nin its history, which culminated in\nthe reconstruction of the Palace of\nWestminster, destroyed in a fire a\ncouple of years before Victoria came\nto the throne.\nWe start with the lady herself: two\nbusts of Victoria, done 48 years apart.\nIn the first, by sculptor Sir Francis\nChantrey, the young monarch looks\nout with a confrontational stare, her\ndress exposing one shoulder; in the\nsecond, Alfred Gilbert, who wasn\u2019t\neven born when Victoria came to the\nthrone, portrays her as the matriarch\nof an empire, her eyes heavy and\ntired, trussed up in lace like a\nswaddled infant.\nThe works displayed in the\nexhibition are often beautiful,\nparticularly in the last room, where\nthe output of the Arts and Crafts\nMovement is given the opportunity\nto shine, but the show works best\nas a history lesson, showing us how\nsculpture was used as a tool to both\nfurther the empire\u2019s power and\nreinforce the dominance of British\nindustry. The face of Victoria\nappears not only in public statues,\nbut also across a number of coins;\nCanadian cents, Indian rupees,\nHong Kong dollars, they all bear\nher visage, allowing her to act as a\nliteral overseer of her realm. Her\npersonage also graced the living\nrooms of innumerable middle-class\nhouseholds, thanks to the invention\nof the reducing machine by Benjamin\nCheverton, which allowed multiple\nsmaller copies of a single statue to be\nmade, thus allowing miniatures of\nthe Queen to be distributed cheaply\naround the country.\nThis link, between industry and\nart, is one that recurs throughout the\nexhibition. The statues designed for\nthe new Palace of Westminster made\nuse of the innovative electroplating\ntechniques, meaning that numerous\nmetals could be applied, giving them\na multitude of tones and hues. There\nwas also an increasing collaboration\nbetween artists and manufacturers, as\nsculptors worked with industrialists\nto produce their wares more and\nmore cheaply; in some ways, this\nwas the start of artistic capitalism,\nallowing the lines between creativity\nand commerce to blur, a process that\nhas continued to this day.\nThis rise of industrialisation\ncontrasts with the fetishisation of\nthe past; with the arrival of the Elgin\nMarbles kick-starting an obsession\nwith classical art, the Victorians\ncompared themselves to another\ngreat civilization: the Greeks. This\nreached a peak with Raffaele Monti\u2019s\nVeiled Vestal sculpture; Monti\u2019s ability\nwith stone is apparent, as he conjures\nup a veil made from marble in an\nillusionistic tour de force of statuary.\nThe most interesting part of the\nexhibition, however, is how the\nVictorian\u2019s love of sculpture pales\nonly to their other great passion:\ncolonising and oppressing other\npeople. While this colonial habit is\nreferenced in the opening room\u2019s\ncollection of coins, it is not until\nlater that it is properly explored;\nmulticoloured elephants and\nporcelain peacocks showed how\nforeign lands promised a wealth of\nriches and amusements for the well-heeled Victorians. The most affecting\npiece in the whole exhibition is A\nDaughter of Eve or The American\nSlave, by John Bell; making use of\nelectroplating technology, the statue\u2019s\ndark bronze skin contrasts with the\nclassical marble whiteness of other\nsculptures. The woman looks to one\nside, her hands bound in chains, in\nan agonising display of humanity\nthat directly challenges the hypocrisy\nof the British Empire\u2019s attitude to\nAmerican slavery. It is this piece that\nforms the emotional centrepoint of\nthe exhibition, helping it become\nmuch more engaging than just a\nmusty history lesson through British\nsculpture.\nSculpture Victorious is on at the Tate\nBritain until 25th\nMay. Tickets \u00a312;\n\u00a39.50 Students.\nThomas Longmore and John H\u00e9nk, Elephant, 1889 Photo: Thomas Goode\n& Co. Ltd., London\nA History Lesson Too Far\nFrom one history lesson to another,this week also\nsees the opening of Tate Britain\u2019s SaltandSilver18401860,the first major exhibition devoted to salt prints,\nan early form of paper photography.Invented by Henry\nFox Talbot,and set up as a competitor to the French\ndaguerreotype,salt prints had a sharp focus but also\na softness,which made them appear somewhat like\ncharcoal rubbings.\nThe photographs on display show how the subjects\nthat enticed the photographer have remained\nsomewhat constant over the last 150 years; the earliest\nphotographers were concerned with documenting\ntheir surroundings,as in David Hill\u2019s photographs\nof fishermen,which set a precedent for social\nphotographers such as Diane Arbus and Brassa\u00ef.\nThere is also a clear obsession with sightseeing,such\nas in Henri Le Secq\u2019s photograph of PalaisdelaBourse: the\nstaid,immensity of the Paris stock exchange contrasts\nbeautifully against the unfettered rush of city life,which\nzooms past the lens in a photographic blur.While the\nrelation between social photography and sightseeing\nmay not seem obvious,the link is closer than you\nmight think; as Susan Sontag says\u201cThe camera makes\neveryone a tourist in other people\u2019s reality\u201d.\nThe salt prints\u2019time in the sun was bright,but brief;\n1850 saw the introduction of the albumen print,\nwhich was the first time such photography could be\ncommercially viable.This was in contrast to the salt\nprint,which was technically more complex.During the\ntime that salt prints were in vogue,there were several\nartists who managed to produce beautifully abstract\nphotographs,such as John Beasle Greene\u2019s images of\nEgyptian statues.Sadly they were few and far between.\nWhile most of the photographs included in the\nexhibition are interesting,they essentially amount to\nlittle more than historical curios; the Tate makes the\nimportance of the early technology clear,but unless you\nhave a particular historical interest,there may not be\nmuch here to catch your eye.It is not until the last room\nthat we get a proper glimpse of human life,as the focus\nshifts from landscape and architecture to portraiture.As\nTalbot says,\u201cthe photographer\u2019s eye is arrested where\nordinary people see nothing remarkable\u201d.I feel this is\ntrue here; as a member of the ordinary people,I fail to\nsee anything remarkable in this exhibition.\nFRED FYLES\nAuguste Salzmann, Statuette en Calcaire; Type Chypriot 1858-1865\nPhoto: Wilson Centre for Photography\n\n"

Clarke\nWhile the advent of the\nInternet Age has brought\nwith it a multitude of\nwondrous things (the information\noverload that is Wikipedia; an ability\nto connect with people around the\nglobe in a matter of seconds; an\nunending supply of cat videos), it\nhas also done something much more\nsinister, allowing people to explore\ntheir deepest, darkest desires. It is\nthis duality that playwright Jennifer\nHaley explores in her groundbreaking play The Nether, which,\nfollowing a sell-out run at the Royal\nCourt last year, has returned to\nLondon\u2019s Duke of York Theatre.\nSet in 2050, a year that manages\nto be simultaneously distant and\nimminent, the premise of the play\nis that the internet has evolved\ninto \u2018The Nether\u2019, a vast network\nof individuals interacting in an\nartificially generated cyberspace;\nover time, more and more aspects\nof life have passed over into The\nNether: schooling, industry, and even\nhumans, allowed to permanently\nreside in this alternative universe\nthanks to the use of complex life-support machines in the \u2018real world\u2019.\nSadly, The Nether has also allowed\nthe base instincts of humanity\nto flourish, and we follow law-enforcement agent Morris (Amanda\nHale), as she tracks down the\nmysterious \u2018Poppa\u2019, aka Sims (Stanley\nTownsend), a programmer who has\ncreated an electronic idyll called \u2018The\nHideaway\u2019. In this grotesque vision\nof Victoriana, Poppa\u2019s clients can\nanonymously come and go, stopping\nby to do unspeakable things to the\nlittle girls who reside in the house.\nOf course, none of the children\ninvolved are real (although the\ncreepily charming Iris was played on\nthis occasion by gifted child actor Zoe\nBorough, in a superb London debut),\nthey are simply pixels, complex\nrenderings of crinoline, silk, and\nflesh; but Hayley asks whether this\nreally matters, and whether indulging\nin such fantasies, even within the\nconfines of the imagination, is\nbeyond the pale of the law.\nAmanda Hale is excellent in the\nrole of Morris, turning what could\nbe a mere collection of tropes (icy\nand brittle high-flyer; dressed all\nin black and sporting a facelift-giving bun; emotionally distant\nwith daddy issues) into a three-dimensional character, thanks to a\nnuanced performance that perfectly\nhighlights the play\u2019s subtleties. But\nparticular credit must go to David\nCalder\u2019s perverted Doyle and Stanley\nTownsend\u2019s blood-chilling Sims: it\nis one thing to play a predator on\nstage, quite another to make them\nseem simultaneously sympathetic\nand sickening. The cast work well\ntogether, creating a multi-layered\ncharacter study in the middle of a\nvortex of moral turpitude.\nJeremy Herrin, fresh from\nproducing Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf\nHall and Bring Up The Bodies, directs\nthis simmering production with a\nsteady hand, helped immensely by\nthe talents of set designer Es Devlin,\nwhose technical trickery helps pull\noff the juggling act of simultaneously\nshowing two locations. From the\nharshly strip-lit interrogation office,\nintimidating in its blankness, we\nare thrown into the Arcadia of The\nHideaway, a beautiful gothic house,\nwhose lush surroundings blur and\nbend in a series of mirrors like a\nmirage, emphasising the ephemeral\nnature of the online world.\nThe Nether is one of those special\nplays that occupies a space in your\nmind long after the curtain has\ngone down. The destructive power\nof cyberspace has always appealed\nto speculative fiction authors, from\nWilliam Gibson, the originator of\nthe term, to Margaret Atwood, whose\nOryx and Crake sees people surfing\nthe web for live videos of suicides and\ntorture; however, as our technology\nhas progressed, the question of what\nlimits we can place on the internet\u2019s\ncollective imagination has shifted\nfrom speculation to reality. Haley\nhas created this play at a critical time,\nraising questions about the regulation\nof technology, the freedom internet\nanonymity can bring, and even the\nvery nature of human relationships.\nThere is a duality between human\nand avatar in The Nether, meaning\nthat everything we are presented\nwith is slightly askew; you can\u2019t trust\neverything you see, least of all on the\nInternet.\nUnlike other recent examples of\nspeculative fiction - such as Charlie\nBrooker\u2019s Black Mirror, which writer\nMallory Ortberg succinctly describes\nas \u201cwhat if phones, but too much\u201dThe Nether doesn\u2019t act as some kind\nof high-brow thought experiment\ndesigned to highlight the perils of\nTinder, or Facebook; it is much\nmore pertinent than that, exploring\nan issue that is already becoming a\nproblem. As Haley herself says, \u201cit\u2019s\nhappening\u201d, citing the much-feted\nOculus Rift technology, and the\nfact that in online roleplaying game\nSecond Life areas for child and adult\navatars have to be separated. In those\nrespects The Nether acts as both an\nominous prediction of the future, and\na timely warning for the present.\nThe Nether runs at the Duke of York\u2019s\nTheatre until 25th\nApril.

Later, one of the reporters\nremarks how \u201cFive Security guards\njust walked past us, and said nothing!\u201d\nAfter bypassing security, they\nran into Lionel Richie, who they\nthen proceeded to interview about\nhow relevant the Brit Awards are.\n\u201cRelevance is what it is all about!\u201d\nhe told the students, before escorted\naway to his seat within the arena.\nThe students then loitered around\nfor around 30 minutes, and ran into\nnumerous celebrities as they were\nshepherded into their seats.

Philippa Skett reports.\n\"The two\nstudents\nalso\nmanaged\nto snag an\nimpromptu\ninterview\nwith\nDamon\nAlbarn.\"\nthey encountered included two\nmembers of the Spice Girls, members\nof the pop group Little Mix, comedian\nJimmy Carr, female musician St.\nVincent and Caroline Flack, the\nesteemed presenter of hit TV Show\nthe Xtra Factor.\nThe pair approached Jade Thirlwall,\none of the members of the girl group\nLittle Mix, and asked Jade if they\nthought another X-Factor contestant\ncould win an award.\nJade, looking confused, was\nunable to answer, but the woman\naccompanying her didn\u2019t mince her\nwords, telling the students: \u201cFuck off\nwe don\u2019t want to talk about X Factor.\u201d\nJade then remarked about how it was\na bit of a \u201cshitty question.\u201d\nThe two students also managed to\nsnag an impromptu interview with\nDamon Albarn, 46, the frontman of\nthe bands Blur and the Gorillaz, who\nwas also nominated for the British\nMale Solo artist award.\nWhen asked whether he stood a\ngood chance of winning he replied\nsadly: \u201cI\u2019m in a category where\neveryone else nominated is twenty-five years younger than me, so I don\u2019t\nstand a chance in hell.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here so my teenage daughter\nand her friend can meet Taylor\nSwift.\u201d\nThey also asked him if he had any\nfavourites to win, to which he replied\n\u201cNah, not really.\u201d He then sadly slunk\naway to take his place in the audience.\nHe later lost the award to Ed\nSheeran, aged 24.\nOne of the intrepid reporters told\nFelix: \u201cWe actually saw a lot more\nfamous people, but we literally had no\nidea who they all were.\u201d\n\u201cI guess there are worst ways to\nspend a Wednesday evening.\u201d\nThe pair hung around backstage\nfor a further two hours, interviewing\nrandom bystanders as the show took\nplace, before leaving and telling the\nsecurity \u201cGood job lads!\u201d\nThey then grabbed a cheeky\nWagamamas before heading home.\nSaid one of the reporters: \u201cAll in all, a\nfantastic night out!\u201d\nThe BRIT awards are held annually,\nand celebrate the previous year\u2019s\nachievements in pop music.\nAbove: One of the ICTV reporters at the O2 Arena for\nthe BRIT awards.
