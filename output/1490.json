    "content": "FELIX\n22\nPoems for the week\nA R T S\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 27 MAY 2011\nSome Shakepearean sonnets to\nget you in the mood\nShakespeare is known for his prolific output of son-nets, written for print while the plague kept people\nout of the theatres. There are 154 poems attributed\nto Shakespeare which take the rigid sonnet form of\nrhythm and rhyme. Usually a declaration of romantic love, some range onto broader topics as well and\nare still easy to read and understand.\nSonnet 29\nMaybe you\u2019ve had your fair share of\nproper Shakespeare, maybe you\u2019ve\nalready seen more than you want to,\nmaybe you just like the idea of efficiency\nin getting through all of Shakespeare\u2019s\nwork in two hours. Well, you might just\nfind this show appealing. A fun romp\nthrough famous plays and their deriva-tives, it achieves well what it sets out\nto do and certainly makes for a pleasant\nevening out.\nThe action follows three actors fresh\nout of the same drama school as they try\nto make their names as Shakespearean\nactors by giving the audience a taste of\nevery play during the course of one eve-ning. The air is low budget and the theatre comfortingly publike (it actually is\na pub) despite its enthusiastic makeover\nas ye Olde Tudor backdrop. Hey, they\u2019ve\neven got a fun spoof programme to get\nyou in the mood. The show is also varied\nand inventive, being split into separate\nsketches on individual plays, and some\ncombinations (for instance all the comedies in one animated film). Although\nnot all side-splittingly funny, they\u2019re\noriginal and good fun, interspersed with\na couple of gems. Who\u2019d have thought\nan \u2018off-the-cuff\u2019 rap of Othello could sit\nso snugly with a Jurassic Park themed\ninterpretive dance? A particular favourite\nof mine was the healthy energetic race\nthrough Romeo and Juliet complete with\npantomime nurse.\nThe real plot of the show revolves\naround the contrasting personalities and\nambitions of the three actors, all excellently portrayed by the three real actors.\nThese characters are caricaturish but in\nthe tradition of the low-budget village-hall genre the production seems intent\non occupying, they are very much de\nrigueur. The performances given by all\nthree actors are energetic, professional\nand impressive throughout. The fool of\nthe funny trio, Lucy Wooliscroft, manages to charm even in the unpromising\npart of a woman who shrieks frequently\nand loudly enough to set the audience\u2019s\nteeth on edge. Whether the play is a parody of this sort of amateur drama or an\nepitome of it, it works to have the audience chuckling into their pints.\nThis play-cum-sketch-show is a warming example of Shakespearean humour,\nnot to mention an excellent appraisal of\nthe great playwright and his work. It\u2019s\nmight not be genius but you can certainly\nget a great feel for the scope of the famous plays and have a relaxed evening\nout at the same time.\nPlaying at The New Red Lion, Islington until August. From \u00a316\nA bumper Bard evening\nThe entirety of Shakespeare\u2019s works in two hours in a\nlow budget pub setting? Count us in!\nMedics take over the Blyth Gallery\nOooh, you sexy Bard you\nRox Middleton\nIris\nUntil 5th June\n\u2018Iris' is an exhibition by medical and\nbiomedical science students who are\nstudying Medical Humanities as part\nof their degree. Students have tackled\na wide range of topics in their artwork,\nfrom prejudice in medical practice to the\nrole of the hospital environment in heal-ing. Equally wide ranging is the choice\nof media. The works include sculpture,\nphotography, painting, modelling, collage and a film.\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\nAnd look upon myself, and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\nDesiring this man\u2019s art, and that man\u2019s scope,\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven\u2019s gate;\nFor thy sweet love remembered such wealth\nbrings\nThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.\nA famous, and highly popular sonnet declaring the\nsolace to be found in the love of another despite\nfeeling otherwise miserable. Nice to remember if\nyou have got someone to think about, less helpful\notherwise\u2026\nSonnet 130\nMy mistress\u2019 eyes are nothing like the sun;\nCoral is far more red, than her lips red:\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.\nI have seen roses damasked, red and white,\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks;\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound:\nI grant I never saw a goddess go,\nMy mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:\nAnd yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,\nAs any she belied with false compare.\nAnother popular choice, Shakespeare explains honestly his feelings for his lover, commenting on the\ntraditional use of ridiculously overinflated hyperbole\nto describe beauty. Whether you think it\u2019s a cheeky\npoem highlighting a sweetheart\u2019s flaws, or the highest declaration of true love probably depends on\nyour romantic tendencies.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n10\nIn brief\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Charlie Harvey\nKelly Oakes\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 27 may 2011\nTop banana fights fungal infection\nFor the past 30 years, the humble banana has been\nunder attack from a fungal invader. Black sigatoga\ndisease, caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fi-jiensis, decimates fruit yields and reduces profit\nyields for some of the poorest farmers in East Africa.\nHelp is at hand, however, from a new genetically\nmodified strain of banana resistant to the disease.\nThe team from Uganda\u2019s National Agricultural Research Laboratories Institute added genes for chi-tinase \u2013 a protein that breaks down the cell walls of\nthe fungus \u2013 which prevents the fungus from entering the plants. The fungus, which can spread by airborne spores and when goods are exported, causes\ndark leaf spots which eventually kill the plant. In\nfield trials, the bananas showed almost full immunity to the disease.\nCurrently, farmers have had to control the pest using aerial pesticide spraying \u2013 a technique that is reportedly harmful to both the environment and to the\nhealth of the local residents. The pesticide is often\ntoo expensive for many farmers. Resistence to the\npesticide is also becoming evident in much of East\nAfrica, making spraying even less economically vi-able. Genetically modified bananas may prove to be\na cost effective method of maintaining crop yields,\nalthough further research is needed to calculate exactly how much of an advantage it will bring.\nSettumba Mukasa, a crop scientist at Uganda\u2019s\nMakerere University, points out the future implications of this research. \u201c[The project] is a stepping\nstone for subsequent breeding programs and genetic engineering programmes. As a consequence\nof this project we can now do transformations of\nother varieties of bananas and other crop species.\u201d\nCharlie Harvey\nAn under-used class of prescription drug for\ntreating asthma is just as effective as conventional methods according to new research.\nScientists, from the University of East Anglia,\nsay pills containing leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) can provide an alternative\nto steroid-based inhaler treatments for mild\nforms of the disease.\nTeam leader, Prof David Price says \u201cWe\nhope these findings will increase the options\nfor healthcare professionals when prescribing for this common but disruptive disease.\u201d\nIncreasing the methods available to sufferers\nis important for improving their quality of life\nand reducing the risk of fatalities.\nWhilst some patients respond well to ster-oids, many find them unsuitable as they can induce side effects such as weight gain and fungal infections. LTRAs have fewer side effects\nand could be helpful for up to 80% of patients\nwho cannot use inhalers. Despite these benefits,\nthey are only third or fourth in order of preferred\ntreatment methods under current UK guidelines.\nThe study also found that administering\nLTRAs orally was easier than using steroid\ninhalers, allowing sufferers to control their\ndisease more effectively. Managing symptoms more astutely can reduce distressing and\nexpensive hospital visits by 75% says Neil\nChurchill, chief executive of Asthma UK. This\ncould amount to huge savings for the NHS,\nwhich currently deals with 74,000 asthma related admissions every year. Asthma affects\n8% of the UK population and, has a social and\neconomic impact with an annual cost to the\neconomy of \u00a32 billion. The disease is caused\nwhen the immune system overreacts to particles in the air, narrowing the windpipe and\nincreasing phlegm production. LTRAs inhibit\nthe molecules that cause inflammation and\nrestriction of the airway to alleviate common\nasthma symptoms.\nA breath of fresh air for asthma sufferers\nJan Piotrowski\nElectrons are almost perfect spheres, new research published in Nature this week has re-ported. Scientists here at Imperial have made\nthe most accurate measurement yet of the size\nof an electron, and discovered that it is only\n0.000000000000000000000000001 cm away\nfrom being perfectly round.\nPhysicists made precise measurements of\nthe motions of electrons inside molecules of\nYtterbium Fluoride. If the electrons were not\nperfectly round, they would wobble and slightly change the shape of the molecule under\nstudy. But the researchers saw no such wobble,\nmeaning that the electron must be spherical at\nthis new level of precision.\nResearch co-author, Dr Jony Hudson, from\nthe Department of Physics at Imperial College London, said, \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased that\nwe\u2019ve been able to improve our knowledge of\none of the basic building blocks of matter. It\u2019s\nbeen a very difficult measurement to make, but\nthis knowledge will let us improve our theories of fundamental physics. People are often\nsurprised to hear that our theories of physics\naren\u2019t \u2018finished\u2019, but in truth they get constantly refined and improved by making ever more\naccurate measurements like this one.\u201d\nThis result is the culmination of more than\na decade\u2019s work by physicists from Imperial\u2019s\nCentre for Cold Matter. It is important for the\nstudy of anti-matter \u2013 an elusive substance that\nacts in exactly the same way as normal matter,\nbut has the opposite electrical charge. When\nmatter and anti-matter come into contact, they\nannihilate one another.\nCurrently the laws of physics predict that\nexactly the same amounts of matter and antimatter were created at the beginning of the uni-verse. We know that this cannot be true, how-ever, because if it were true all of the matter\nand anti-matter would have been annihilated\nand there would be none of either left in the\nuniverse today.\nThis means there must be a fundamental difference between matter and anti-matter. Had\nthe researchers found that electrons are not\nround it would have provided proof that matter\nand antimatter differ more than physicists had\npreviously thought. This may have then explained how all of the anti-matter disappeared\nfrom the early universe.\nThe Standard Model of particle physics predicts that the deviation of the shape of an electron from a perfect sphere would be too small\nto measure. Several proposed extensions to the\nStandard Model do predict a measurable dis-tortion, so this result may turn out to be useful\nin exploring new physics beyond the Standard\nModel.\nProfessor Edward Hinds, research co-author\nand head of the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe whole world\nis made almost entirely of normal matter, with\nonly tiny traces of anti-matter. Astronomers\nhave looked right to the edge of the visible\nuniverse and even then they see just matter, no\ngreat stashes of anti-matter. Physicists just do\nnot know what happened to all the antimatter,\nbut this research can help us to confirm or rule\nout some of the possible explanations.\u201d\nTo help improve their measurements of the\nelectron\u2019s shape, the researchers are now developing new methods to cool their molecules to\nextremely low temperatures, and to control the\nexact motion of the molecules. This will allow\nthem to study the behaviour of the embedded\nelectrons in far greater detail than ever before.\nKelly Oakes\nElectron sends scientists round in circles\nFoot-loose and fungal free, that\u2019s me!\n24 March - 31 August 2011\nat the Wellcome Collection\nA new exhibition from the Wellcome Collection,\n\u2018Dirt\u2019 discovers the grimy truth behind the stuff we\nare surrounded by but normally try and sweep under\nthe rug. The exhibition explores the past, present\nand future of dirt in an increasingly clean world.\nDirt: The filthy reality of everyday life Phwoarrrrrh!!! She leaves me breathless\n\u201cSome scientist stole my electron!\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m positive!\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 27 may 2011 17\nCOMMENT\nYes \u2013 Gareth Rosser No \u2013 Angry Geek\nWith the identities of those with superinjunctions\nall over Twitter, mentioned in Parliament, and\npublished in the Scottish papers, Felix asks...\nT\nhe simple answer? Yes. Freedom of\nspeech is one of the hallmarks of a\ncivilised society, and injunctions curtail that freedom in a very real way.\nI mean, let\u2019s be honest I\u2019m a reason-able-ish person and in extreme and rare situations,\nI could be persuaded that injunctions might have\na place. But these days, celebrities are using them\nto hide extramarital affairs or other activities of\nan embarrassing nature. Quite frankly, this is not\nenough of a reason.\nOne premiership footballer got an injunction\ngranted because he might be \u2018booed during games\u2019.\nAs a professional footballer you can expect to be\nheckled about something. \u2018Cruel chants\u2019 are apparently enough to warrant an injunction.\nIn taking out an injunction, these celebrities are\ntrying to ignore one of the most important lessons\nwe learn as children. Every action has a conse-quence. The celebrities hiding their identities are\nsimply trying to avoid facing the consequences of\ntheir actions. What gives them that right? I mean,\nif you\u2019re a famous public figure, then you\u2019ll have\nknown that the media would publish a story about\nyour affair if they found out. And yet you still\ndecided to have an affair. You knew the risks of\ndiscovery in our media age, don\u2019t throw your toys\nout of the pram if you get caught out. Nobody was\nforcing you to play.\nMeanwhile, injunctions open the door to hypoc-risy, as Andrew Marr, former political correspondent for the BBC has demonstrated. A man whose\ncareer requires him to quiz politicians on their\npersonal lives used the legal system to stop people\nprying into his personal life. How can anybody be\na journalist and also have a gagging order placed\nupon the press? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. At least\nAndrew Marr did the right thing, and confessed\nto having had a gagging order placed. He himself\nadmitted to being embarrassed at having taken out\nsuch a thing. As well he should.\nInjunctions themselves have become outdated\nsince the evolution of social media websites.\nFacebook and Twitter allow rumours to spread\nat a ridiculous speed. So whilst official English\nnews sources like the BBC, the Times and even\nFelix were not able to name Ryan Giggs, more\nthan 75,000 Twitter users already had. This not\nonly makes flaunting injunctions easy, but leads\nto wild rumours being accepted as fact. Innocent\ncelebrities will be accused of having taken out\ngagging orders without any proof, and this can be\ntaken as fact by the world at large. The best way\nto stop false accusations is to not give the public\nfigures who have done something stupid a legal\nsmokescreen.\nThe extent of these injunctions is mind\u2013boggling. Until a peer announced that Sir Fred Goodwin had taken out an injunction to protect the information about his alleged affair, almost nobody\nknew about it. Not even the Members of Parliament who were investigating his management of\nthe RBS bank during its nationalisation knew?\nInformation directly relevant to the investigation\nmight never have been known, thanks to the gagging order. This only serves to show what can happen when freedom of speech and freedom of the\npress is lost. The media is one of the ways we keep\nour leaders in check. Celebrities know they have\nto answer to the media, and through the media, to\nthe public. Our leaders and public figures should\nbe held accountable for their actions, and how do\nwe do that if they can legally gag the media?\nI\u2019ll admit, maybe there is a place for injunctions\nin certain special cases. But in the way they\u2019re\ncurrently being used undermines their purpose.\nThey\u2019re being used for selfish reasons, to escape\nconsequences. And ironically, many of the injunctions taken out have led to more publicity for the\ncelebrities, not less. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t take some\nsmall satisfaction from this. I appreciate that celebrities are human. They make mistakes. We all\ndo. But some celebrities seem to think they deserve to hide from their mistakes. With the dawning of the internet, celebrities may end up having\nto eat their just desserts.\nI\nrealise you may be slightly concerned to see\nmy name here, on the other side of the page,\nthe one where the crazies live and people\nthink that celebrities should be able to have\naffairs in secret. Well, yes and no. I\u2019m here\nfighting for the side of superinjunctions not because I think it\u2019s right to keep the naughty actions\nof others a secret, but because, seriously, fuck you\nguys.\nI know. I know that is my excuse for just about\neverything. But something quite lovely almost\nhappened to the newspaper headlines this week.\nThey very nearly shut up. I have next to me yesterday\u2019s copy of the Times, and only 50% of their\nfront page is dedicated to this bullshit about someone\u2019s penis gaining unauthorised access to another\nperson\u2019s vagina. Imagine that, only 50%. If only\nMr. Giggs had managed to avoid being revealed by\nthat stupid MP, we might\u2019ve had something useful\non our newspaper front pages this week, instead of\nutterly shit puns on his name and dire interviews\nwith people who bumped into Imogen Thomas\u2019sister one day on the bus to Haskins.\nYou see, superinjunctions only serve the rich and\nthe stupid. But those are exactly the kind of people\nI don\u2019t want clogging up my media outlets. Far\nfrom being a slippery slope towards state censor-ship, the superinjunction laws are an amazing way\nfor the celebrity world to shoot themselves in the\nfoot. Less publicity means more real news. More\nreal news means less need for me to write and tell\nyou why I think you don\u2019t need to hear about who\nis shagging who. You\u2019re reading this now precisely\nbecause superinjunctions aren\u2019t properly enforced\nyet. Imagine if they were. You wouldn\u2019t be here!\nYou\u2019d be done by now, you\u2019d be thumbing through\nthe Music section or something. But no. You\u2019ve got\nto finish reading this whole page. Look at all those\nwords. You made this happen.\n\u201cBut what if the bad men come,\u201d I hear you cry,\n\u201cWhat if we wake up in 1984.\u201d and then you do\nthat thing with your nose where you sneer at me\nfor never having read it. Firstly, like you\u2019d fucking notice. You feckless arseholes can\u2019t even\nsummon up the interest to detach yourself from\nReddit and Facebook, god knows why you\u2019re all\nconcerned about the government taking over the\nfreedoms you barely bother exercising. In a year\nthat\u2019s contained nuclear scares, huge earthquakes\nand continent-shaking revolutions, if the most you\ncan get worried about is someone censoring your\nhilarious twitter hashtag jokes, then you deserve\nstate oppression.\nBut secondly, and perhaps more importantly, this\nslope isn\u2019t slippery. It\u2019s barely inclined, look. Every five seconds someone was mentioning Ryan\nGiggs on Twitter. The internet is sufficiently powerful that, should anything really malevolent happen and be covered up, that the truth would eventually out. This isn\u2019t oiling up the slope and sitting\non it arse-first. This is a case of telling the difference between things that are important (like NHS\nreform, and net neutrality \u2013 you remember, those\nthings that were your flavour of the month earlier\nin the year) and things that are so utterly unimportant that important things actually bend slightly as\nthey pass near them (like two empty vessels dick-ing furiously in some motel up north). If there\u2019s\none thing this horrific Conservative government\ncould be useful for, and looking at the track record\nso far, I\u2019d be surprised if it got above \u2018one thing\u2019,\nit\u2019s shutting up the hordes of screaming Closer!\nreaders and Loose Women viewers for good.\nYes, the people trying to stop information getting\nout freely are bad and evil and self\u2013motivating.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t manipulate\nthem for your own gain. In this case, if people with\nlots of money think that stopping newspaper headlines from using their name will solve all of their\nproblems, then so be it. I encourage them to do\nso. We\u2019ll continue being libellous on Twitter, and I\ncan start buying newspapers again without feeling\nlike I\u2019m picking up a copy of Heat.\nLeave my fucking newspapers alone, celebri-ties. You want your privacy, and I sure as shit want\nmine.\nShould we abolish\nsuperinjunctions?\n\u201cCelebrities hiding their\nidentities are simply\ntrying to avoid facing the\nconsequences of their\nactions\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing this\nConservative government\ncould be useful for it\u2019s\nshutting up the hordes of\nCloser! readers\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Queenie hates playing wife-swap...\nFELIX Friday 27 may 2011 15\nBUSINESS\nT\nhese days it is quite difficult to find something in\ncommon with everyone\nin the world, apart from\nbeing human, but there\nis one thing that comes close: Internet\nusers. There are about 2 billion of them\naccording to internetworldstats.com.\nFrom a business point of view, this is\nthe biggest market sitting in one place,\nbut what product or service can you provide for all of them?\nGoogle got it right: every Internet user\nneeds to search. Facebook has a hefty\nslice of the Internet pie with over 500\nmillion users by their own stats. However, there are not many others to talk\nabout since Internet users are not all the\nsame.\nLet us get a bit more realistic now.\nSuppose you come up with a product,\nsay dog food, and market and sell it on\nthe internet. You have narrowed your\ncustomers to only dog owners but that\nis still a massive audience who are willing to pay to feed their dog. The problem you face here is that the market\nis still too big and there are so many\ncorporate dog food manufacturers that\ngobble up all the small fish and leave\nyou broke.\nWhat next? Narrow your market fur-ther. Market your dog food purely for\nLabradors. You might manage to make a\ncouple of bucks but probably not much\nmore.\nSo you narrow your market further, to\ndog food for racing Labradors. Suddenly you have customers paying for your\nproduct because it is exactly what they\nare looking for. You add more products\nto your line up, dog collars for racing\nLabradors, dog soap and shampoo for\nracing Labradors, etc. You get the point.\nThe more you specialise, the smaller\nyour market, but the more loyal your\ncustomers.\nThis is the essence of niche market-ing; identifying a small portion of the\nmarket with a specific problem and offering products and services marketed\ndirectly at solving that problem. You\nare in effect monopolising a particular\nmarket.\nThis was extremely difficult before\nthe internet; how many owners of racing Labradors could you find in your\nneighbourhood, or even city?\nChances are that there are not enough\nto be profitable. However, you now\nhave a medium to access all those racing Labrador owners, and indeed any\nniche market, throughout the world - the\ninternet.\nThis is what has made starting a business so attractive in recent times. You\nfind something you are good at, need,\nor have a problem with. Then creating\na business around that becomes easy\nbecause you are both the expert and the\nend user.\nThere are, however, some pitfalls. If\nyour market is too broad, you will have\ntoo much competition, as already ex-plained. If you find a niche market but\nyou define your market too generally,\nyou could end up with a lot of competition very soon after you start. If you\nare not good, it will be easy for someone\nto copy you, improve on it and steal all\nyour thunder.\nThere is also the problem of recognising a market that is too small to ever be\nprofitable. At that point you either have\nto give up the idea or do some charity\nto get it out.\nThat is why it is always important to\ntest the market and start off with low\ncosts and capital, because you could end\nup losing very quickly. Here again, the\ninternet saves the day.\nSince the target is small, your aim\nalso needs to be good. If you do not present your product in the correct light, it\ncould get lost in the internet because it\nis not attracting the right people. Direct,\nstraightforward and pin-point marketing strategies need to be employed, no\nmore of this wishy-washy subliminal\nnonsense.\nIf you get everything right, however,\nyou could end up making a substantial\namount of pocket money. It is the ideal\nbusiness for a student; niche marketing\nmeans you do not need to be a jack of\nall trades, but putting all of your eggs\ninto one beautifully woven basket could\nprove profitable.\nNiche marketing on the net\nNitin Nihalani from Imperial Entrepreneurs\u2019 Society on the power of specialising\nBusiness Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRex doesn\u2019t look impressed by the sales pitches he\u2019s heard for PooTrap\nUK grows 0.5 per cent; Obama visits; and more\nUK economy growth 0.5 per cent\nThe UK economy was able to grow despite a 0.6 per cent drop in consumer\nspending and 4.4 per cent drop in in-vestments. These figures were offset by\na 3.7 per cent rise in export earnings,\nwhich increased the economy by 0.5 per\ncent over the quarter and 1.8 per cent\nsince last year.\nThe strong export-led growth, which\ncontributed a record 1.7 per cent to\noverall GDP growth over the last quarter (meaning that GDP would have\ncontracted by 1.2 per cent had exports\nearnings remained constant), is largely\ndue to the weakness of the Pound Sterling. Yet this same currency weakness\nis contributing to soaring inflation. This\nhas the Bank of England divided over\nwhether to raise interest rates. Advocates of this argue that it will dampen\ninflation growth, whilst others worry\nthat it will leave the fledgling recovery\nstill-born. The Bank remains cautious,\nsaying that, \u201csome pickup in underlying growth is likely during 2011, albeit\nless than was judged probable in February, driven by a continuing recovery in\nbusiness investment and a positive contribution from net exports.\u201d The Bank\u2019s\nGovernor Mervyn King added that the\nrecovery will take \u201cnot just one year, but\nseveral years.\u201d\nObama arrives for State Visit\nAfter the official state dinner that welcomed Obama to the UK on Tuesday\nevening, the President and his delegation of senior advisors spent Wednesday\nin talks with their British counterparts to\ndiscuss global fiscal policy, budget deficits and international bailouts.\nThe Queen had toasted the Obama\u2019s\nvisit, which was only the second official\nfull state visit by a US President in his-tory, by saying that the visit was meant\nto \u201ccelebrate the tried, tested, and yes,\nspecial relationship between our two\ncountries.\u201d\nBut the visit, which is part of a tour of\nEurope by Obama, is widely seen as being focused primarily on realining fiscal\npolicy between Europe and the US as\npart of an ongoing effort to bring about\na more internationalist response to the\nglobal recession.\nChristine Lagarde bids for IMF\nThe French Finance minister Christine\nLagarde decided this week to capitalise\non the impeccable reputation of French\npoliticians at the IMF to announce her\ncandidacy to be the next head of the\norganisation. Despite objections from\nmany developing nations that the job\nalways goes to a European, they have\nfailed to unite around an alternative and\nIntrade.com gives Lagarde an 88 per\ncent chance of winning the position.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 27 MAY 2011 23\nARTS\nThe British summer has officially be-gun. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe theatre has\nset its band of players onto the road for\nthree months of comedy \u2013 As You Like\nIt. And what a riotous three months it\npromises to be. James Dacre directs a\ncast of eight who take on double that\nnumber of parts in this Victorian adaptation of one of Shakespeare\u2019s most loved\nand revived comedies.\nAs You Like It contrasts court and\ncountry living, explores gender roles,\nrevels in romantic love and would have\noffered audiences of the time space for\na good few hours of escapism and rude\njokes.\nThe staging and text of this adaptation\nteem with energy and there is rarely a\nmoment when the actors are not bounding about the stage in the slickest and\nmost controlled fashion \u2013 dispelling any\npreconceptions people may have had\nthat the Bard is staid and heavy. The\nnimble, slapstick element of the drama\nmixed with the audience\u2019s shouting,\nlaughing and cheering gives the show\nall the ebullience of pantomime, sans\ncringe factor. Indeed, Jacobean comedies such as As You Like It were the\nprecursor to panto.\nGunner Cauthery is well cast as the\nyouth Orlando, banished by his older\nbrother Oliver from their home, lover\nand pursuer of Rosalind (Jo Herbert),\nwho is required to assume the appearance of a man, change her name to Gannymede, and flee the court of her evil,\nusurping Uncle \u2013 the Duke Frederick.\nThe part of Rosalind has often made\nstars of those who assume it (Vanessa\nRedgrave, Helen Mirren) and it would\nnot be surprising if the same thing happened to Jo Herbert. \u201cUncommonly\ntall\u201d, Herbert has a powerful stage presence and an equally powerful voice.\nThe Globe: just as you like it\nThroughout the summer, masses of Shakespeare will be performed at the open air\ntheatre on the Southbank. Just one of those plays will be the touring As You Like It\nCaz Knight\nJohn Tramper\n\u201cWith all the free\nlove, liberation and\nfluidity of sexuality\nin the Forest of\nArden... it seems\nShakespeare was a\ntrue avant-garde\u201d\nShe is accompanied to the Forest ofAr-den by her cousin Celia (Beth Park) and\nthe motley fool, Touchstone (Gregory\nGudgeon). Both Herbert and Park, as the\ncomically exasperated Celia, bring a fantastic dynamism to the double act.\nGudgeon as Touchstone is hilarious\nand one of the many highlights of the\nproduction, with his crude gestures and\nhorn honking. At 300 lines, it is one of\nthe largest parts for a fool among Shakespeare\u2019s plays.\nCounterpart to the fool is the melancholic Jaques. This production has incorporated a Madame Jaques, as opposed to\na Monsieur Jaques, and Emma Pallant is\nstupenduous as the philosophising de-pressive. Clothed in an over-sized coat\nand slighty mannish in mannerism (but\nslight in stature), Pallant\u2019s dark hair and\nlarge dark eyes conjure all the gloom required of Jaques and are also highly appropriate when she switches to playing\n\u201cblack silk haired\u201d Phebe \u2013 the country\ngirl, loved by bumpkin Silvius (Ben\nLamb), who falls for Gannymede.\nBen Lamb shifts with ease back and\nforth between his three roles: flamboyant Le Beau of usurping Duke Frederick\u2019s court; brawny wrestler Charles and\nfaithful servant to Oliver; the love sick\nand spurned Silvius.\nFight director Terry King has helped\nCauthery and Lamb enact a realistic\nand brutal bare-knuckle boxing match\nbetween Orlando and Charles the Wrestler, carried off with precision and inciting many \u201cooh\u201ds and \u201cah\u201ds from the\ncrowd as heads are slammed into walls\nand elbows collide with faces.\nNot only does each actor stand out\nindividually but the cast together has a\nfantastic chemistry which makes each\nand every portion of dialogue seamless,\nheartfelt and engaging. They have made\nall jokes and puns accessible, especially\nthe dirty ones, without any dumbing\n\u201cThere is rarely\na moment when\nthe actors are not\nbounding about the\nstage in the slickest\nand most controlled\nfashion\u201d\ndown, \u2013 showing us just how little sense\nof humour and appetite for the salacious\nhas changed! Neither, it seems, has\nShakespeare\u2019s fascination with cross-dressing and the examination of gender\nroles. With all the free love, liberation\nand fluidity of sexuality apparent in the\nforest of Arden \u2013 issues and ideals still\nvery much at the fore of contemporary\ndiscourse \u2013 it seems Shakespeare was a\ntrue avant-garde.\nEverything about Dacre\u2019s production\nfrom the first to last scene is a joy. Georgina Lamb\u2019s choreography; composer\nOlly Fox\u2019s beautiful score; designer\nHannah Clark\u2019s booth stage and stunning pastoral mural, which earned itself\ngasps from the crowd as it was revealed.\nThere are far, far too many outstanding points about this production to men-tion. And, anyway, it would be far, far\nbetter to experience them first hand. As\nYou Like It will meander its way up and\ndown the country and even hop over to\nthe German Globe theatre near Dusseldorf, as well as making a few returns to\nSouth Bank\u2019s Globe Theatre between\nnow and September.\nCheck for a location near you: www.\nshakespearesglobe.com/theatre/\non-tour/as-you-like-it\nThink Shakespeare\u2019s just people prancing about in tights and capes? Think again. Although admittedly that is what they\u2019re actually doing in this photo. I guess you were right all along\n\n"

I am a\nmember of the Green Party and\nhave consequently participated\nin several environmental proj-ects. In recent years Imperial\nhas made significant progress\nto be environmentally friendly,\nhowever I believe much more\ncan still be done.\nMy goal is that Imperial\nCollege London will be the\nleading example of what can\nbe achieved when saving the\nenvironment. Using our technological prowess, I want us to\nbe coming up with innovative\nideas that will make real differences regarding green issues.\nH\ney guys, I\u2019m Alan, a\n2nd Year Physicist and\nI want to represent you\nas an Entertainments Committee Member.\nI am very actively involved\nwith the union and want to see\nit grow and improve. There are\nmany students who are not fond\nof the union itself and do not\nattend many of its organised\nevents - I want that to change.\nThe union should be a place\nwhere you can expect to bump\ninto not only your classmates\nand colleagues, but also friends\nfrom other London universities\nwho have heard great things\nabout it.\nThe Summer Ball was a huge\ntalking point this year and I\nam as curious as anyone to see\nU\nniversity is about more\nthan lectures, tutorials\nand- eugh- revision.\nEven moreso given the endless\nopportunities London offers to\nentertain and entice us and as\nsuch, I understand the importance of fun and being entertained whilst at Imperial. I\u2019ve\nalways been happy to go to the\nunion with friends (often jumping at the opportunity), sported\nsome \u2018interesting\u2019 costumes\nand ran around central London\ndressed as santa to raise money\nfor charity to name but a few.\nI\u2019ve been involved in everything I can this year, from RAG\nto societies, a variety of DepSoc events to just sitting around\nrelaxing with friends.\nIt\u2019s important that we imI aim to provide cost-effec-tive solutions in reducing the\nenergy consumption levels at\nImperial. An example of this\nwould be to provide light sensors around campus and making sure that departments and\nhalls. From coordinating with\na STEP change ambassador,\nI was personally involved in\nconducting a number of assessments and surveys evaluating\nareas of improvement to increase efficiencies and reduce\nenergy wastage. As a result I\nam familiar with areas that need\nconsiderable improvement in\nwhich I hope to address should\nI get elected.

I hope it will\nbe a great success but, if it isn\u2019t\nand I am elected, I can assure\nyou that I will consult with as\nmany students as possible before making any new decisions\nnext year.\nIn terms of experience, I have\nbeen elected ACC Vice-Chair\nfor next year which means I\nwill be in charge of the infamous ACC Barnight and my\nrole as a hall senior in Beit hall\nwill allow me to be \u201cin touch\u201d\nwith the freshers.\nThanks!\nALAN SOLTANI\nprove our Union in any way we\ncan, and I\u2019ve been elected as\nBiochemSoc events officer and\nhave promised to ensure it\u2019s a\nfun and entertaining society,\nand above all else I feel that the\nphilosophy of \u2018time enjoyed is\nnever time wasted\u2019 applies to\nuniversity and life in general,\nand this is what I want to bring\nto the entertainments commit-tee.\nIf elected I will\u2022 Apply for work at the Union\nBar to stay in constant contact\nwith the goings-on and to see\nhow it\u2019s going for students\n\u2022 Be in regular contact with\nthe other committee members\nand have frequent informal\nmeetings as well as the formal\nones to ensure the smooth running of the committee\n\u2022 Write a termly Felix article\nabout events that term\n\u2022 Ensure the committee is accessible and easy to reach if anyone\nhas questions/wants some information\nJACK HEWITT\nEntertainment Committee Member\nEnvironmental Officer\nI\nmperial College is infamous for its male to female\nratio, especially obvious in\nthe engineering departments.\nThis sex imbalance creates opportunities for potential sexual\ndiscrimination and harassment,\nwhich comes on top of already\nstressful work environment.\nI regard the main role of gender equality officer to prevent\nviolation of the women\u2019s rights\nin the day-to-day university activities (such as lectures, coffee\nbreaks and living in the library)\nas well as in halls. Largely due\nto introduction of the Gender\nEquality Scheme at Imperial,\nthe number of sexism-related\nissues has shown to be consistently decreasing for the past\nfew years. I have talked to\nH\ni, I\u2019m Joachim Dias,\n2nd year undergraduate in materials. I\u2019m\nrunning for Healthy living officer because I feel Imperial\ndoesn\u2019t provide enough support\nfor students.\n\u2022 I want to make Halal and\nKosher food available everywhere in Imperial because I\nthink everyone should have the\nchoice to eat what they want to\neat according to their religion.\n\u2022 I will also try to make the\nfood quality of SCR available\nfor undergraduates, it\u2019s not because you\u2019re an undergraduate\nthat you can\u2019t eat healthy food\nbut get the bad quality food of\nJCR.

My\naim is to continue this positive\ntrend through: serving as a link\nbetween students, the union and\norganizations such as Women\nin science, regulation of union-activities and increasing ap-proachability.\nSome might wonder whether\na male student is suitable for\nsuch position.

I understand that\nthe overuse of compliments\ncan appear na\u00efve at the best\nof times, and deceitful at the\nworst. My gut tells me that\nit\u2019s a terrible, terrible mistake to not be\nable to spot the flaw in something, that\nI\u2019m being tricked. I cringe at my credu-lousness. But, you see, the thing is I\u2019m\nin love and, as Plato put it, I\u2019ve become\na poet. I met her for the first time last\nweek. The most cursory glance lets you\nknow that she\u2019s curvaceous, strong,\nwith plenty of character, her style ef-fortless. And boy can she suck, squeeze,\nbang, blow.\nThey say that the first time one sees a\nnew Ferrari in the flesh, it\u2019s like meeting\na beautiful woman. You lose your mind,\nyour heart accelerates.And so it was last\nThursday, at the Parisian launch of the\nFerrari F.F. The first ever Ferrari to have\nfour comfortable seats and four-wheel\ndrive. There\u2019s something about the supernatural elegance of the machine, the\nlushness of the leather interior, the towering brilliance of the technology, the\nterrifying depth of engineering knowhow that makes me feel quite giddy.\nEnzo Ferrari once said that the best\nFerrari is the one that is yet to come.\nThe F.F. is the closest thing to that. It\nis a thoroughbred designed to gallop\nwhatever the weather or surface \u2013 be\nit snow, ice, or sand. It is the first ever\nfour-wheel drive V12 that comprises of\na rear-mounted electronic differential. It\nis the first V12 in the world to sport a\nseven-speed dual-clutch F1 gearbox. It\ndoes 0-100km/h in 3.7 seconds. It has a\ntop speed of 335km/h, and 660 prancing\nhorsepower. Its engine doesn\u2019t growl or\nhowl \u2013 it\u2019s music to the ear, it\u2019s somewhere between a purr and a roar.\nSure, Jeremy-power-Clarkson will\nprobably write some pontificating, climate hating, boorish review of the F.F.\nin a few weeks\u2019 time. He\u2019ll complain\nthat there are warts. That its little Italian\nways will drive you a bit mad. That the\nengine is in the wrong place. That racing shouldn\u2019t be done in the snow. That\nit\u2019s like a horse with James May up its\nbottom. But then he\u2019s not in love. And\naccording to Twitter, he\u2019s never been.\nAnd that really is the crux. I\u2019ll be hon-est: I don\u2019t know how well a Ferrari\nhandles compared to an Aston Martin\n\u2013 which features work and which don\u2019t\n\u2013 but I\u2019m damned if I would ever buy\nLifestyle Editor: Richard Keller\nlifestyle.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCharles Betts and his love for the new do-it-all Ferrari\na DB9 over a 458 Italia. But then, a\nFerrari is meant to be loved, not under-stood. Ferrari is like opera, ballet, fine\nwine \u2013 to some, a seemingly over-the-top, exaggerated distraction where The\nX Factor, Strictly Come Dancing, and\nCoke would do just fine. But to others,\nit transcends the logical. To some, sort\nof pointless. To others, sort of amaz-ing. I\u2019ve never really appreciated Domingo\u2019s arias, or Pavlova\u2019s pirouettes,\nbut my religious-like zeal for what is effectively just a red piece of carbon and\naluminium on four wheels means I understand the mysterious emotion some\nfolk get from a 1787 Chateau d\u2019Yquem.\nFerrari is the epitome of the Made in\nItaly brand. It\u2019s as classically Italian as a\nTuscan hilltop or Lavazza coffee. Each\ncar a rather dizzying conflation of old\nand new. To see one and drive one is\nto simultaneously be right back in the\ndays of Fangio, to be part of the greatest\nmotor racing company in history, and\nto be at the cutting-edge of technological development. The company doesn\u2019t\njust represent itself, but rather an entire\ncountry. It\u2019s why their F1 cars have the\nItalian flag painted on the rear wings.\nIt\u2019s why it\u2019s the only F1 team that has\na major fan base, the famous tifosi. It\u2019s\nwhy every red-blooded Italian male\ncries Forza! and Prestissimo! in their\npokey Fiat Panda with so much gusto,\nbelieving he\u2019s Michael Schumacher. It\u2019s\nwhy the entire Italian road network is\none big racetrack. Football may be the\nheart of Italy, but Ferrari is very much\nits soul.\nFerrari sold 6573 cars in 2010 \u2013 its\nbest ever year. A result primarily attributed to the extraordinary growth seen in\nAsia, and the return of the United States\nmarket to record levels.

It would\nbe great to see more students\ncoming along to voice their\nopinions and hold our sabbatical officers to account.

I have loved\ndedicating my time to students\nas ICSMSU President, but still\nfeel that I have more to offer the\nwider Imperial community.\nThis year has taught me skills\nextremely relevant to this role:\nI chair numerous Faculty and\nStudents\u2019 Union committees\nand have learned how to encourage contributions from quieter members, minimise repetition and ensure that discussions\ndo not centre solely around\nvocal members. I am currently\na member of Council and a permanent observer of the Trustee\nBoard, so know what the job\nentails.\nT\nhe Council Chair is a\ntough role because it requires one to remain impartial and never take sides for\nany discussions. It also requires\none to be assertive to keep discussions controlled, and at the\nsame time be able to absorb\ninformation presented quickly.\nBut the most important trait a\nCouncil Chair should have is a\npassion for our university and a\ndesire to serve the students.\nWith my ability to separate\nemotion and work, and to process information, I certainly\nmake a good candidate for the\nrole. However, I will excel as\nthe Council Chair and the main\nreason is my passion for our\nuniversity and for serving other\nstudents. It was also for this\nthey happen, I\u2019ll work hard to\npublicise the results of Council\u2019s work in Felix and on the\nUnion website.

    "content": "FELIX\n26\nGAMES\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 27 MAy 2011\nGAME\nWhat did you study at Imperial?\nI did the BSc in Physics from \u201897 to\n2000, although even then I was fiddling\nwith computers a lot more than I was\npaying attention to my physics course,\nunfortunately.\nSo you finished your BSc and then\nwhat happened?\nSo then what happened was I ended up\ngetting a job in a software company that\nmade network management software for\nfinancial services companies. I didn\u2019t go\nstraight into the games industry at all,\nand that wasn\u2019t what I was planning\nat all. I started out as a Sysadmin, but\nquickly discovered that programming\ncould help me solve a lot of the problems that I faced as a Sysadmin and I\nended up actually heading the programming team at the place I worked.\nSo your first job got you into pro-gramming, but how did you move\nfrom general programming into, spe-cifically, games?\nWell, actually I got a call from [co-founder of Media Molecule] Alex\nEvans, who has been a friend of mine\nfor many years, saying that they were\nlooking for a server programmer. For\na while I was a little bit reluctant, because I knew the games industry was\nfamous for certain hours and practices\nand so on and I was quite comfortable\nin my financial services job. But, when\nAlex explained what they were making,\nand the whole concept behind LittleBig\nPlanet, I just had to give it a try and just\nthought, \u2018well, if I can do this then it\u2019ll\njust be fantastic!\u2019\nYou mentioned that you initially had\nquite a lot of preconceptions that it\nwas long hours and not necessarily\ngood pay. Has your view changed?\nDo you still think it\u2019s long hours and\npoor pay?\nWe do sometimes work some long\nhours but we try to keep that to an absolute minimum. Really, we see that as a\nsign of poor planning, so it\u2019s not something that we build into the schedule. I\nhave been pleasantly surprised by\nthe [post-release] crunch: at\nleast, with LittleBigPlanet 2\nI was pleasantly surprised\nby the crunch but with\nLittleBigPlanet we did\nhave quite a nasty\ncrunch period. I think it probably goes\nwith the territory of smaller studios\nthat there\u2019s just less of everything and\nmore to do. So overall, I think my view\nhas changed in the sense that the better\nyou manage your planning, and the better you manage your project, the more\nyou\u2019re able to deliver what you want to\ndeliver in the time available. It\u2019s a kind\nof discipline \u2013 to deliver great stuff in\nthe time available rather than trying to\nsqueeze ever more stuff into ever diminishing time slots.\nSo now you\u2019re in the games industry,\nis it where you want to stay?\nThat\u2019s a very good question. I am really interested in how technology can\nbring people together, and how technology can enable people to achieve things\nthat they were not necessarily able to\nachieve before, or that they didn\u2019t even\nknow were possible to achieve. And so\nin that respect I would love to work in\nanything where game mechanics apply.\nObviously, the first place to look for\nthat is the games industry, but there are\nmore applications of those kind of prob-lems. With this whole emerging trend of\n\u2018gameification\u2019, I think a lot of people\nare looking to game mechanics now to\ninject a bit of dynamism into their product experiences. On the other hand, it\u2019s\nnot just about injecting dynamism, it\u2019s\nabout injecting joy - for me - and it\u2019s got\nto be a genuine attempt to try and make\npeople\u2019s lives more enjoyable, or better,\nbring people together. So yes, the games\nindustry is one example where that happens a lot, and compared to a lot of the\nother IT-type professions, there\u2019s a high\nincidence of that in games.\nNow, being a physicist, as I well\nknow, although we do a bit\nof programming, it\u2019s not\nreally done very rig-orously. We do programming to \u201cdo\nstuff\u201d, we don\u2019t\nreally look at the\nfundamentals. Do you feel that was\nsomething that hindered you, or do\nyou think it\u2019s not really an issue?\nNo, I think the usual canard that\u2019s used\nis: in computer science things are done\nrigorously and in industry programming\nis just used to solve problems, to \u201cdo\nstuff\u201d as you said. In that sense, the kind\nof programming that I learnt during\nmy physics degree was the same kind\nof level of pragmatism: just \u201cget stuff\ndone\u201d. On the other hand, there are certain things that happen in professional\nprogramming that don\u2019t happen very\nmuch in either the sciences or in computer science. That\u2019s things like how\nsoftware teams work together as teams,\nhow you plan stuff, how you deliver\nstuff on time, how you make sure that a\nbuild from three years ago is still build-able, if you check it out from source\ncontrol - oh, did I mention, you should\nAt Imperial\u2019s very own\ngames conference,\nSimon Worthington\nchats to two Imperial\nalumni who describe\ntheir experience in\n(and getting in) to the\nindustry\nJames Fairbairn\nfrom Media Molecule\n\u201cIt\u2019s just great to\nhave been there for\nLittleBigPlanet and\nto have gone through\nthat whole process;\nreally, it was an\nhonour\u201d\nGAMES AND MEDIA EVENT\nLeft: Marc Hull of Frontier Developments (Kinectimals and RollerCoaster Tycoon).

The Quick Tap service offers customers the ability to pay bills of \u00a315 or less using their phones at\ncertain high street chains. Simply tap your phone on\nthe special reader and the money is debited from\nyour account virtually instantly. Quick Tap is currently\noffered at around 5,000 retailers across the country,\nand is the first volley in a barrage of such services to\nbe launched this summer by major mobile operators.\nIt\u2019s almost definitely worth waiting a few weeks to\nsee what O2, Vodafone and 3 have up their sleeves,\nbut if you can\u2019t be bothered with using a Chip and\nPIN device, patience probably isn\u2019t your strong suit.\nStaring blankly at the outside of your house on\nStreetView might have begun to get a bit old, but\nGoogle has started to spice things up by moving\ntheir StreetView cameras right into shops and res-taurants. The service has launched in Japan and\nAmerica, and British shopowners can also apply to\nhave their shops photographed by Google. It slots\nseamlessly into Google Maps, allowing you to move\ndown a street and simply \u2018walk\u2019 into high street\nstores with the click of a button. While it\u2019s arguable\nhow useful this feature is by itself, there are many\nfeatures that could be added to the service to make\nit more interactive. For example, dropping into a restaurant could allow you to order takeaway or reserve\na particular table. Knowing Google, they probably\nhave all of this planned \u2013 watch this space for more\nin the near future.\nStreetView goes indoors\nEver since Spotify Open limited users to 10\nhours of free music and 5 plays per track, I\u2019ve\nbeen on the hunt for alternative streaming services that offer something similar to its huge\nlibrary and smooth browsing experience. If\nyou\u2019re searching too, here are my experiences.\nOf all the streaming sites, Last.fm and I\nhave had the longest relationship. We first met\nback in 2007 and I was immediately smitten by\nthe Artist Radio feature that plays you songs\nsimilar to those of your favourite artists. It\u2019s\ngood new music on tap, tailored to your tastes,\nand there\u2019s nothing not to like about that. Yet\nLast.fm has never had all it would take to hold\nmy heart. 4 years on, they still don\u2019t offer\nproper playlists and have been steadily cutting\ndown on the amount of free music you can listen to. Give it a glance if you are tired of your\nlibrary, but don\u2019t expect it to become your new\nfavourite.\nI spent most of 2009 two-timing, splitting my listening between Grooveshark and\nSpotify. Grooveshark was exactly what I was\nlooking for to complement Spotify: web-based\nstreaming that doesn\u2019t require a user account.\nIt\u2019s an excellent service which has added features over the years to the point where it\u2019s now\nvery similar to Spotify, minus a few features\nand the restrictions. Unlike the others, Grooveshark is driven by user uploads, meaning it\u2019s\na great place to hear albums as soon as they\nrelease. If you\u2019re willing to put up with relatively mediocre sound quality, there\u2019s a huge\nlibrary of free music at your fingertips.\nWhile I long thought Grooveshark would be\nmy only thing on the side, discovering mflow\nwas a pleasant surprise. Its feature set is basic\n- a library of 5 million songs and no playlists.\nFocussed heavily on social networks, posting\na song to your Facebook or Twitter profile will\noffer you discounts on purchasing music if\nsomeone buys it using your link. All of this is\ndone with the blessing of major record labels,\nmeaning the songs available are of a consistently high quality.\nYet despite my promiscuity, the truth is that\nI haven\u2019t really been able to replace Spotify\nin my heart. I am even about to return to it,\ndespite the small dent it\u2019ll put in my wallet. \u00a35/\nmonth for unlimited, ad-free music on a huge\nnumber of different devices isn\u2019t too much to\nask. Spotify\u2019s real victory is not in selling a\nnew service but in combining most other services into one slick, attractive package that\u2019s\nwon me over from the day I set my eyes on it.\nAfter Spotify, what next?\nOne stop shop for help with your laptop!\nThe ICT Service Desk over on Level 4 Sherfield is a busy place. In fact it\u2019s where all of\nImperial\u2019s students and staff get assistance\nwith IT and the small but efficient team that\nis the Service Desk handle over 6000 requests\nper month to keep everyone working.\nFor students in particular, if your laptop is\nrunning slow, virus-infected or just not working as it should be, bring it along for us to have\na look at and book it in to our Laptop Surgery\nService.\nLikewise, if you have any other questions\nregarding your email, home directory (aka\nH:drive), wireless network or one of the many\nonline services, you can pop up and have a\nFeroz Salam\nAdam Mills chat to get you back up and working.\nHere at the Service Desk we believe IT\nshould be helpful rather than a hindrance and\nwithout wanting to sound like the world-dom-inating supermarket, we\u2019re here to help. Oh\nand it\u2019s also a free service \u2013 now, you can\u2019t\nargue with that!\nDid you know?\nICT are currently running a survey and all\nresponses will be entered into a prize draw\nto win one of 3 Amazon Kindles and 3 iPod\nShuffles \u2013 let ICT know what you think of\ntheir services here now: http://bit.ly/ICT-Survey2011 - deadline is Friday June 3rd\n2011.\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX\n28\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nVeronika McQuadeova\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 27 may 2011\nacters. While Misato and Asuka may\ninitially come off as, shallow and simply annoying respectively, we really\nget to care for them as we learn more\nabout them and see them develop over\nthe course of the series. Some critics\u2019\nbiggest problem with Evangelion is\nthe constant whining and self-doubt\nof our protagonist and while it sometimes does get on my nerves I think\nthat it is, for the most part, justified by\nwhat he has been through, both before\nand during the series. Indeed almost\neverybody in the series is mentally\ntortured in some way but the series really manages to show how\ndeal with their problems in a\nway that is both sensitive and\ninteresting.\nThe most divisive element of\nEvangelion is probably its plot. I\nhave to admit that it is quite over\nthe top, including a heavy use Christian\nmythology, government conspiracies\nand a secret plan, called the Human\nInstrumentality Project, to join together\nall consciousness. It is probably down\nto personal opinion if you like this sort\nof thing but I really urge you to try. If\nyou can suspend your disbelief Evangelion can actually make you take it\nseriously so you realise how deep and\nsatisfying the story is.\nAny discussion of Evangelion would\nbe remiss if it did not mention the infamous ending, which I feel strongly\nabout. The last two of the original 26\nepisode run were so badly received that\nI originally skipped right over them and\nwent straight to the remade ending in\nthe 1997 film \u2018The End of Evangelion\u2019.\nI decided to finally watch the original\nand was shocked by how good it was.\nI can see why it was so poorly re-ceived, being fairly understated, using\nmainly stock footage and taking place\nentirely in the minds of our protago-nists: a massive departure from the rest\nof the series. It even lead to the coining of the term \u2018Gainax Ending\u2019 after\nthe company which created Evangelion\nto describe shows which finished with\na similar tonal shift. While it is clear\nthat Gainax was having trouble funding\nThis week I am going to review something a bit different: the landmark 90s\nanime Neon Genesis Evangelion. This\nis the first real anime that I have ever\nseen so I do not really know how well it\nstands up to other works of this format\nand am just going to have to review it as\nwork of science fiction.\nEvangelion is set in 2015, 15 years\nafter half of the world\u2019s population was\nkilled by the mysterious Second Impact,\nwhich the general populace believes to\nhave been a giant meteorite hitting Antarctica. In fact it had something to do\nwith the Angels, giant creatures of unknown origin which have now returned\nto threaten humanity. They are protected from all conventional and even\nnuclear weapons by their so-called AT\nfields and so can only be stopped by the\nEvangelions, mecha based on the Angels themselves and created by the UN\nparamilitary organisation NERV. Our\nprotagonist is Shinji Ikari, abandoned\nby his father, NERV commander Gendo, over ten years ago but now called\nback as the only person able to pilot\nEvangelion Unit 1.\nReading the last paragraph back I\nrealise that Evangelion sounds like an\namalgamation of the worst anime stereotypes or some cheap Power Rangers knock-off. Believe me, this is not\nthe case. You can tell that this show is\nsomething special from the beginning\nof the first episode with a long atmospheric shot of a flooded city with a\nline of UN tanks on a high mountain\nroad above it, guns aimed\nat a large shape moving under the water.\nThe tone of each\nscene is perfectly judged,\nhelped by a\ngood choice of\nmusic and animation which,\nthough admittedly looks a bit\ndated, is still\nstunning.\nThe greatest\nstrength of the\nseries, however,\nmust be its\nc h a r -A never ending story\nFelix takes a look at Neon Genesis Evangelion, the\ninternet-forum-posting geek\u2019s favourite anime series\nMaciej Matuszewski\n\u201cI realise this sounds\nlike an amalgamation\nof the worst anime\nstereotypes...believe\nme, it is not\u201d\nIn the future, the hustings for union elections turn out to be a lot more enjoyable\nRemakes and re-edits\nThere are almost as many versions of Neon G as\nBlade Runner and Apocalypse Now, combined.\nThe Original Series\nFirst aired in Japan in 1995, the\nTV series is the logical place to\nstart. Twenty-Six 30-minutes\nepisodes back-to-back make for\nan excellently geeky all-nighter\nwhich we at Felix Television thoroughly recommend.\nThe Director\u2019s Cuts\nPretty much the same as above\nbut with added material. Some\nhelps make the overall plot make\nmore sense, some of it helps it\nmake less sense. Before you can\nget into a neckbeard internet ar-gument, I am afraid you will have\nto watch both so you can compare them in minute\nstylistic details.\nAs refered to in the article (right), the final two ep-siodes of the original television series were a tad\ncontroversial. By which I mean the studio entrance\ngot covered in graffiti calling them rapists and production members received death threats. So, ostensibly to satisfy the fans, an entirely different\nstyle of ending was released which effectively told\nthe same story but with substantially more 20 storey robots, flying monsters and naked teenage girls,\nwhich is pretty much all they ever wanted in the first\nplace. What quickly becomes apparent is that this\nnew ending is far from satisfactory, and many Eva\nconspiracy theoriest believe the film to be a bit of a\n\u201cfuck-you\u201d from director Hikedai Anno.\nEnd of Evangelion\nThe Rebuild of Evangelion\nAnother decade, another remake.\nThe story of the TV series is in the\nprocess of being retold in a tetralogy of films, part 2 of which is out\non DVD with an English dub later\nthis year. Fantastically enhanced\nanimation is complimented (or\nruined, depending on your preference) by the addition of CGI. The first film was fantastic, for revisiting\nfans it was like Facebook stalking a hot girl from\nschool and finding out she has now got a badass\ntattoo on her thigh. But then the second film hit\ntorrent sites and suddenly ergonomic keyboards\nwere ablaze with furious tapping and water cooled\ngaming PCs were struggling to keep up with frantic\nblog posting because, low and behold: they have\ncompletely and utterly changed the plot. What this\nno doubt means is that there is yet another ending\nin the works. Furthermore if the trend of increasing\nthe levels of balls-to-the-wall apocalyptic madness\nwith each remake continues (and with a teaser suggesting SEELE now have a base on the moon, we\ncan assume that it does) then Evangelion 4.0 will\nhave a finale to make the Book of Revelation look\ntame.

Hemming was able to supersede the\ncourt order that demanded the footballer in\nquestion remain unknown due to parliamentary privilege.\nThere had been many suggestions regarding\nthe identity of Miss Thomas\u2019 secret lover; Arsenal fans were adamant that their talismanic\nhero, Emanuel Eboue, was the culprit whilst\nLondon rapper Giggs was forced to release a\nstatement distancing him from the claims. Fernando Torres was initially implicated but soon\ndisregarded by the media due to his inability\nto score.\nHemming was not the whistleblower; users\nof the social networking site twitter had been\nbanding Giggs\u2019 name around in connection\nwith the alleged affair for weeks. On Monday\nit was announced that the footballer in question was looking to take legal action against\ntwitter as well as over 75,000 users who had\n\u2018tweeted\u2019 about his relationship with Miss\nThomas.\nIt is alleged that the footballer took out the\ncourt order for the sake of his family and to\n\u2018protect\u2019 them from the harmful revelations,\nwhich may come out about his affair with the\nformer Miss Wales contestant. Presumably\nthe alleged culprit was not thinking about\nhis family whilst being balls deep in the page\nthree strumpet. As Nate Dogg (RIP) would\nsay, the footballer needs to regulate himself.\nThese superdooperinjunctions seem ques-tionable; you make a mistake, you own up to\nit and take it like a man and move on with it.\nIf the alleged footballer at the center of these\nallegations had admitted what happened outright rather than trying to swallow the whole\nsorry incident up with court orders and subsequent law suits he would have come out\nlooking much rosier than he does currently.\nThink back to last year when John Terry admitted to having an affair with England team\nmate Wayne Bridge\u2019s ex-finance, Vanessa\nPerroncel. Terry eventually owned up, got a\nshit haircut to look like a proper douche and\nthen accepted the fact that he and Bridge\nweren\u2019t ever going to be friends again. Bridge\nhas moved onto bigger and better things and\nis now porking Frankie Sandford from \u2018The\nSaturdays\u2019. Lucky bugger. Wayne Rooney\nadmitted he bedded a Granny prostitute and\nthe world and Coleen have moved on. The\nlegendary Brazilian striker, Ronaldo, was alleged to have partied with some pre/post-op\ntranssexuals, despite this, no one forgets what\na great player the dirty dog was despite ballooning to the size of a baby elephant in the\ntwilight of his career.\nAllegations regarding sportsmen\u2019s private\nlives won\u2019t detract from their sporting ability but negatively impacts their stature in the\nprivate eye. I thought Ryan Giggs was just\nan aging footballer. now I see he\u2019s a bloody\nLAD.\nWeneedyourinputtohelpshapethe\nexperienceofstudentswithdisabilities\natImperial.Takepartandyou\u2019llgeta\n\u00a310Unionshopvoucherforyourtime!\nTHURSDAY\n12:00-14:00\n2 June 2011\nSAF G61\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nThe following is intended as a joke and is not a\nstatement of fact.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 27 may 2011 29\nthese episodes I am inclined to believe\nstatements by the show\u2019s creator Anno\nHideaki that this was the ending that he\nreally wanted. The experimental style\nallowed the viewer to literally see what\nwas going on inside Shinji\u2019s head and\nmade the resolution of the problem of\nhis growing self-doubt, arguably the\ncentral theme of the show by that time,\nall the more believable.\n\u2018End of Evangelion\u2019, on the other\nhand, was certainly more in keeping\nwith the rest of episodes, and indeed\nsucceeded in being even more over the\ntop. It is saying something when one\nof the least outlandish scenes was of a\nGerman teenager ploughing her way\nthrough the Japanese army in a giant\nmecha while laughing manically and\nshouting, \u201cMama, I\u2019ve finally found\nyou\u201d. While it was arguably created to\nmake the ending clearer there I do not\nthink that it really does tell the viewer\nmuch more. While we do see Human\ninstrumentality being initiated, in what\nis certainly one of the most impressive\nscenes in all of Evangelion, we still\ndo not understand any more about it\nthan when Gendo simply said \u201cToday\nis the day\u201d in the original penultimate\nepisode. Indeed \u2018End\u2019has its own, much\nshorter, sequence taking place inside\nthe minds of the protagonists which is\neven weirder than in the original. The\nmain new element that I think \u2018End of\nEvangelion\u2019 brings to the table are the\nfrankly short but touching conclusions\nto the character arcs of some of the more\nminor characters, including my favou-rites: Lieutenant Ibuki and Professor\nFuyutsuki.\nDo not take my assertion that \u2018End\u2019\nis no better than the original to mean\nthat I think it is any worse. Several fans\nhave expressed the opinion that the two\nendings are really just different versions\nof the same thing: the original just being a part of the \u2018dream\u2019 sequence in\n\u2018End\u2019. I think that there is a lot to support this conclusion but even if you do\nnot subscribe to this viewpoint it is still\nworth seeing the two together as probably the best endings Evangelion could\nhave had. Sure there will always be\npeople who are annoyed at the unanswered questions: what exactly was the\nmysterious organisation SEELE which\nwas controlling NERV, where did the\nAngels come from, what exactly was\nInstrumentality? Would, however, the\nshow have been better if these questions\nhad been answered? I am reminded of\nthe ending of \u2018Ashes to Ashes\u2019 which\npretty much fully explained how the\n\u2018Life on Mars\u2019/\u2019Ashes to Ashes\u2019 universe worked. The ending was rightly\npraised and if its creators wanted to give\na definitive answer to the questions the\nshows posed this was probably the best\none they could give. Since the finale,\nhowever, I have always had a nagging\nfeeling that something was lost, that the\nshows were better when the mystery\nwas still alive.\nSince then, probably due to the negative response towards these two endings,\nHideki has decided to remake the entire\nshow from scratch as a series of four\nfilms, the \u2018Rebuild of Evangelion\u2019, the\nfirst of which was released in 2007. This\nfirst film is basically a straight remake\nof the first few episodes of the anime\nwith improved animation, though CGI\nwas used a bit too often for my taste.\nIt fixes a few of the anime\u2019s problems,\nthe English language dubbing of some\nof the minor character is far improved,\nbut a lot of unnecessary cuts have been\nmade: the opening scenes in particular\nfeel a bit rushed. In conclusion, I cannot\nguarantee that you will like Evangelion\nbut I certainly think it is worth a try: if\nyou are anything like me you are in for\na treat.\n\u201cEnd of Evangelion\nwas certainly more in\nkeeping with the rest\nof episodes, and succeeded in being even\nmore over the top\u201d\nThe most willfully uncaring bastard in television history.

In addition local ways of life are\nbeing eradicated as the next generations of the\nvillage gather an increasing appetite for western\nfashion and music.\nThe situation is a microcosm for tensions and\nangst being seen all over the globe, but it is receiving more media attention based on the persistence of residents to eradicate this problem.\nAnd with their inevitable success it is no doubt\nthat the residents of other popular tourist destinations will soon follow suit.\nWhilst it is easy to envision a solution to this\nproblem it is almost impossible to put into practice \u2013 unfortunately we cannot easily control the\nmovements or mentalities of every individual\nvisitor. But there are certain things to bear in\nmind when visiting a poverty-stricken destina-tion: a \u00a31 tip goes a surprisingly long way, and\ngood manners cost nothing.\nAdhering to such standards might not alter the\nlong-term outcome, but it will certainly make\nyou seem a lot less obnoxious, and you will be\ndoing other people a service.

We\nsoldiered forwards, trekking past donkeys and\nlocal children, andour backpacks felt heavier\nand heavier.\nWatching the sun set that night, the Isla Del\nSol fell to a deathly hush, a stark contrast to\nthe noisy partying of La Paz. It was a surreal,\nbeautiful moment. Then, the braying of donkeys and the loud call of a cockerel broke our\npeaceful sleep at an unwelcome hour of the\nmorning and we left the Isla del Sol and its\nmossy Inca staircase to cross the border to our\nfinal destination, Cusco.\nIt was strange to say goodbye to Bolivia and\nher wild dogs, industrial trucks, hilly streets,\ntop-hats, stupendous scenery, flamingos, salt-flats, night stars, folklore and tiny islands.

The\nfestival has really evolved \u2013 from its beginning\nas a small one day event in the year 2000 \u2013 to a\nglobal sensation bringing together the world\u2019s\nbest DJs. In previous years artists such as The\nProdigy and Tiesto have appeared in the line-up. However, live acts, such as Friendly Fires\nand Gnarls Barkley also play at this festival.\nThis allows for a relaxing atmosphere if you\nfeel like you need a break from the rave. Tickets vary from \u00a3135 for a three day camping\nticket to \u00a360 to just go on the Sunday. There\nare also VIP tickets for those that enjoy being\nclose to the action but do not enjoy the grime\ninvolved with camping. This gives access to\nhot showers, posh toilets and the Hed Kandi\nHospitality Arena along with free parking.\nThere are 10 stages across the whole festival\nmeaning that there is a plethora of choice when\nit comes to deciding what to listen to.\nThe line-up this year is incredible and makes\nfor an epic show on the 11th birthday of the\nfestival. It is an amazing display of modern\ndance music with drum and bass DJs such as\nDanny Byrd, Andy C and the Scratch Perverts to electro/house DJs such as Tiesto, David Guetta, Calvin Harris and Fake Blood.\nThis is just a taster of the acts available to see.\nRinse, rave, and repeat\nThe UK\u2019s premier dance festival, Creamfields, is a true\nclubber\u2019s paradise says Sean Harbison\nDates: 26th - 28th August 2011\nLocation: Daresbury, Cheshire\nPrice: \u00a360-\u00a3135\nWebsite: www.creamfields.com\nvan Dyk.

This festival\nwill not disappoint.\nThe Chemistry Siblings... No that\u2019s not right. The Biology Sisters? Oh never mind...\ndoor staff are nothing like the bald-headed\ngeezers you find in London. They\u2019re disarm-ingly friendly and seem rather bemused by all\nthe undercuts, skinny jeans and frankly awful\nmoustaches tramping through the door.\nThe evening starts with Brooklyn-based\nmusician Deradoorian, who while inoffen-sive, does little more than warm up our ears;\nthe crowd politely claps her through her set.\nGroup Doueh, on the other hand, put on the\nmost fun live performance that I have seen in\na long time. They\u2019re a family outfit from the\nWestern Sahara and come on stage dressed in\nwhite polka dot sheets. They play rhythmic\ndrum and keyboard music, and before long the\nwhole crowd are dancing. Ok, I lie, before long\nmyself and a group of guys who I can only describe as hippies are dancing; the rest of the\ncrowd is frankly confused by what appears to\nbe the North African equivalent of the Jackson 5. Their set crescendos with a sublime\nfive-minute guitar solo from father Salmou\nBaamar, played behind his head. They were\nthe word entertainment personified.\nFinally it was time for Animal Collective\nto take the stage. Friends had warned me that\nthey would play an unapologetically experimental set, with no or little regard for which\nsongs their fans wanted to hear. They were\nright. Playing against a backdrop of psychadel-ic visuals, they played some seriously strange\nbut-still-just-about-melodic music. Thumping\ndrums bounced up through your chest as peculiar noises screwballed through the air straight\ninto your head. It was thoroughly hypnotising\nand before long I started to wonder why I was\nso sweaty; the annoyed looks that the guy to\nmy right was throwing me told me that I may\nhave been dancing a bit too energetically.\nWhen they started to play \u2018Brother Sport\u2019 I\nmust confess that a little ecstatic voice in my\nhead shouted \u2018oh shit, I know this song!\u2019\nUnfortunately my little one man psyche-out\nwasn\u2019t to last very long. London was calling and\nthe last train back to civilization was a good 20\nminutes before the gig ended. Who knows what\nhappened at the end of the gig? Maybe they\nplayed \u2018My Girls\u2019...

Iraq hasn\u2019t yet reached the status\nof a likely holiday destination and yet trouble\nin other countries close by has overcast the\nproblems left by decades of international and\ncivil war, largely inflicted upon its population\nby Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. In a trend that\nseems to be becoming the norm, the western\nworld stepped in to alleviate what it believes to\nbe the bee in its bonnet, without realising there\nwas a whole hive overhead.\nMy sister has recently returned from a trip to\nKurdistan: an independently governed region\nin the north of Iraq, broadly equitable to the\nstatus of Wales here in the UK. Over a period\nof 10 weeks she worked with a local Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) called KURDS\n(the Kurdish Reconstruction and Development\nSociety), who were established in 1991. Their\noriginal remit was that of providing clean\ndrinking water and sanitation to returnees\nfollowing more than a decade of conflict and\ndisplacement: the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988),\nthe Anfal Campaign in 1988 when Saddam\u2019s\nforces destroyed 4,000 villages, and the Kurdish uprisings in 1991 against the Regime. I\nhope that you would agree that provision of\nwater and sanitation seems to be a noble cause.\nAround that time, the international scene was\nlargely concerned with the Gulf war, which\nsaw Iraq invade Kuwait. Thus, the international media focus shifted towards concerns of international politics and oil greed. In a western\nculture where it\u2019s not unusual to give money to\ncauses and charities, individual donors would\nfind it hard to sympathise with the country\nstarting wars. If anything, I perceive that we\u2019ve\nstarted to learn that lesson from history: it\u2019s the\ngovernments who start international wars, not\nthe people of the country.\nIn Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya,\nthrough the movements now known as \u2018the\nArab Spring\u2019 populations have been demonstrating their dissatisfaction with their rulers.\nIn many cases, the world initially stood on\nthe sidelines peering in, praising this call for\ndemocracy and trying to do what they could\nto help. These call for regime changes and\ndemocratically selected leaders chimes in with\nthe overriding tones of the season including\nlegal aid, abolition of corruption and focus\non international human rights which, again I\nhope we can agree, are also noble causes. So,\nif this is what\u2019s in fashion how do NGOs like\nKURDS survive? The answer is that they have\nto broaden their remit. Instead of focussing on\njust water and sanitation, grant applications\nnow extend to legal aid courses and voter\nawareness campaigns and agricultural training courses, whilst the NGO is left choosing\nwhich two out of three schools will receive\nthe funding available for a functioning toilet\nblock. And they play the game, so that they\ncan stay on the international aid radar which\nwill hopefully one day service their initial re-mit, and so that they can stay employed them-selves: two further struggles for local NGOs\nin developing regions.\nSo what can we discern from this? Probably\nthat we tend to have a very short attention span\nwhen it comes to the real scale of these prob-lems. Not to undermine their efforts, but charities like DEC (Disasters Emergency Committee) thrive on this, as people are largely willing\nto give in response to specific natural disasters.\nThe countries that require the assistance of\nglobal charities like DEC will eventually need\nthe assistance of their local NGO\u2019s too, who\nhave the local knowledge of how to restore\nlife to what it was in a culturally relevant way,\nschool toilets and all.\nOverall, what could we hope to achieve in\na world that is constantly \u2018moving on\u2019 with\nregard to international aid? Is the recent renaissance of the elbow patch (seen this season\nsurreptitiously, but fashionably, placed on a\nlady\u2019s cardigan) a sign that we are capable of\nnostalgia and reviewing faux pas or innovation\nfrom the past? I worry that we\u2019ll continue in\nthis cycle of trendy development topics or crises and giving to each in turn instead of establishing a sustained commitment to ensure the\nsurvival of the efforts of those actually implementing the action for long-term restoration\nor development. International aid agencies do\nstick around, in some places for decades, but\nthey aren\u2019t as immune to fluctuating political\nclimates and agendas as many would perhaps\nhope. It would seem that if targets like the Millennium Development Goals actually have any\nchance of being met, everyone, not just the\ngovernments of developed countries, should\nkeep them in mind constantly. That way, if\nyou do choose to support an international cri-sis, think about what we should support: those\npeople, organisations and charities who are in\nthe position spatially and for the long haul to\nprovide the assistance on the ground directly\nto where it\u2019s needed.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEgypt\nAt least one person has been killed and twenty\ninjured in a blast at an Iranian refinery as the Iranian President was visiting. The refinery in Abadan\nwas opened by President Ahmadinejad and consisted of two stages which will ultimately supply 6\nmillion litres of petrol for domestic uses. A top Iranian official has said that the blast was not an act\nof sabotage and Iranian media reported that it was\ndue to a technical problem. President Ahmadinejad\nis currently locked in a power struggle with Iran\u2019s\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, after he reinstated the intelligence minister the president tried\nto sack.\nIran\nEgypt\u2019s ousted President Hosni Mubarak and\nhis two sons are to be\ntried for his alleged role\nin the killings of anti-government protestors\nduring Egypt\u2019s uprising.\nMr Mubarak also faces\nan additional charge of illegally acquiring wealth during his 30 year rule. The\nMubaraks, whose bank accounts in Switzerland\nand Cairo are frozen, deny this accusation. Several\nformer ministers in Mubarak\u2019s administration have\nbeen detained including the former Interior Minister\nwho was jailed for 12 years for money laundering\nand profiteering.\nRussia\nA Russian appeals court has upheld the sentence\nof Mikhail Khodorkovsky but reduced his sentence\nby one year to 13 years.

Bang on trend...\nFELIX\n30\nFOOD\nFood Editors: Dana Li\nVicky Jeyaprakash\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 27 may 2011\nGastronomical Musings\nI was going to dazzle you all with a review of a restaurant this week but seeing the almost prolific response we received to our coffee article last week\nI thought I would join in with the conversation. It\nseems when it comes to our caffeinated sustenance we all have rather exacting standards and I\nwould not expect anything less than that from any\ntrue coffee aficionado.\nOne of our readers mentioned the wonderfully\nphallic handheld espresso maker for those of us\nwho refuse to drink anything that is not up to our\ncalibre. At \u00a3100 it is not cheap but definitely ensures long term satisfaction. Given that the major\nproblem with coffee on campus seemed to be connected to technique, do it yourself may be the only\nway for those who have certain needs.\nNow that all the clearly unintentional punning is\nover, we can return to the issues. The only consensus seems to be a fair amount of contention over\nwhether the coffee on campus is quite as terrible as\nThomas McFadden thinks it is. Sorry Tom, the cheapness seems to make more than a few people feel\nsome leeway is allowed with the end product; and\nthat a little bitterness now and again is good for the\nsoul. The key, it seems, is get yourself a good base\nproduct in an Americano or Espresso (SCR, EEE, SAF\nor Chemistry Caf\u00e9) and then add your own milk. If\nyou are drinking Latt\u00e9s then you are on your own\nbut I suspect the majority of you are not the ones\nthat care anyway. There was also some chat around\nthe Felix office that College is not responsible for\nroasting its own beans (shocker!); it is whoever they\nsource it from who is screwing up.\nOn another note, we generally give College catering a lot of flack here but last week\u2019s article has had\nmany come out of the woodwork in praise of caf\u00e9\nstaff and their coffee making prowess. It seems\nindividuals have their own favourite baristas and\nthough they do not know their names they are incredibly grateful.\nSomeone mentioned the dreaded coffee machine\nin the back of the SAF as a cheap alternative and\nI could not disagree more, I spent a whole day of\nlectures staring at that dire concoction of water and\nsludge realising that there really was a limit to my\ncaffeine problem. However as far as I am concerned\nI would much rather drink a mediocre cup of joe in\nCollege than milky, frothy, bland tasting, and arrogantly priced branding that is Starbucks Coffee. Except if I want an Iced Caramel Macchicato because\neveryone knows that is a dessert.\nVicky Jeyaprakash\nCheap chicken\nCoffee on campus; not everyone is\nthat fussed it would seem\nSamuel Furse ponders fast food\nC\nheap Chicken will never die. If\nanything it is on the increase,\ndespite McDonald\u2019s and the\nubiquitous beef burger having\nbeen around longer even than\nmost of us. The trouble is that it is looking\nas though its days may well be numbered, not\nleast because various things have now clipped\nits wings.\nBeef is traditionally a staple meat for much\nof the western world\u2014much as it should be\non nutrition grounds alone, it is an excellent\nsource of protein as well as energy-giving\nfats that are particularly ideal for those in\nhigh-calorie-burning manual work. Beef is\nalso a flavoursome meat, and is not hard to\npick out in a blind tasting either on flavour or\ntexture, even when cooked badly. Currently\nhowever it is significantly more expensive\nthan poultry and despite its prominence, is\nonly slightly cheaper than game meats such\nas duck and venison in middle-class super-markets. You can also see this variation\nin the prices of dishes in restaurants, sandwiches in Sainsbury\u2019s or menu items from the\nUnion kitchen.\nNot only is beef more expensive, but provides an environmental problem. Part of the\nMcLibel trial in the 90s focussed on the felling\nof ecologically valuable vegetation, including\nrainforests, in order to produce fertile land on\nwhich to rear cattle. This fertile land lasted\nonly a few years before it was washed away.\nThis lead to more forest being cut down and\nso on. Not only did this reflect badly on the\nbeef producing industry in America but precipitated how beef is reared and sourced, being\nfollowed up in more recent years by analyses\nfrom various quarters about how animals are\nreared and slaughtered in the UK. Currently\nwe have laws relating to animal husbandry that\nare more stringent than those in Europe. That\nis why, incidentally, Danish bacon is cheaper\nthan British bacon, despite that additional cost\nof transporting it from northern Europe to the\nUK.\nSupply is of course not the only thing that\ndictates price in any industry. Demand is also\npart of the equation. This demand has lead to\nthe spread and flourishing of a variety of chick-en-based fast food shops. KFC is of course\nthe oldest, but Chicken Cottage and other pale\nimitations are now widespread. These shops\nalso have their own dedicated suppliers: large\nscale catering supply companies that specialise in supplying fast food chicken shops of all\nkinds, who now market themselves indepen-dently. Or on the side of their lorries at least.\nThere is money to be made in budget fast food,\nevidently.\nAnd so we have a food industry which fails\nto excite the passion of the environmental\nlobby, and is cheap enough such that drunk\nstudents can and will eat it without the concern that it will destroy the planet or break\nthe bank. Seems pretty reasonable. It is also\nfair to say that cheap chicken is probably succeeding where others may have had their day,\nbut is this a good thing? It would be easy\nfor a commentator to tell everyone to eat in\nMichelin-starred restaurants and hang the\ncost, though there is Mr Scarface himself to\nput even the most tenacious off doing that,\ndespite the cost. And of course you should,\nbut none of us do. What is there left? We are\nin a downturn and after a few drinks, crispy\nchicken wings are tempting, available and\nmanifestly cheaper than venison tatare with\npear sauce. And anything has got to be better\nthan another packet of crisps, surely?\nT\nhe only Michelin-starred pub\ngastropub in London has a surprising signature dish \u2013 the humble Scotch egg. Of course, it is\nsomething very special. The egg,\nhidden within plenty of flavourful venison\nsausagemeat, has a firm white but impossibly\nrunny yolk and is coated in the most crunchy,\ngolden brown breadcrumbs. This sums up my\nimpression of the Harwood Arms. It is something simple and comforting that has been obsessively refined to the point of being ethereal.\nThe menu consists of pure, seasonal beautiful British fare. It is free from any gimmicks\nor mind-games that many Michelin restaurants\nare guilty of. There is not a smudge of foam\nor a speck of overly rich sauce with a pointless French name in sight. The home-baked\nbread that arrived straight away stunned with\nits artisanal qualities and the two-week wait\nfor the table was already justified. The starters of an extremely well-executed Eel tart and\nthe perfect Scotch egg made me start planning\nmy next visit even before my main course of\nsucculent wood pigeon fillets and homemade\nDouglas fir sausages arrived. There is lot of\ngame featured, especially venison, and the\nrestaurant website tells us that some of the\ningredients are proudly hunted by the owners\nthemselves. By the time I was onto dessert and\ncoffee, I was convinced I was dreaming. The\nlight and fluffy homemade doughnuts with fragrant lemon cream and sweet eggy bread with\nsharp rhubarb were both easily the best specimens of these classics that I have ever tried.\nLocated on a quiet corner of a residential\nstreet between Fulham Broadway and West\nBrompton, the exterior of the pub is deceitfully\nunassuming. It is not obvious whether the pub\nis even in business or not. But once you are\ninside, there is a Heavenly atmosphere. The\nroom is light and roomy but is still cosy with\nits rustic interior. The clientele is predominantly affluent, but not ostentatious, locals\nwho have come to let their hair down just to\nenjoy quality food and drink. Everything about\nthe institution is tasteful and everyone present\nrelaxed and mild-mannered.\nYou would be happy to marry your daughter to the charming, intelligent Harwood Arms\nwaiters wearing smart-casual really well. Good\nservice is more about character and style,\nrather than crumb-sweeping and extensive\nknowledge about vineyards. You will not hear\nme saying this very often, but just over thirty\npounds for three courses excluding drinks here\nis an absolute steal.\nHarwood Arms, 27 Walham Grove, London\nSW6 1QR, 020 7386 1847 Nearest Tube:\nWest Brompton or Fulham Broadway.\nFast food \u201cis cheap\nenough such that drunk\nstudents can and will eat\nit without the concern\nthat it will destroy the\nplanet\u201d\nReview:\nHarwood Arms\nby Aki Matsushima\nLast resort?\n\n"

As Felix has reported\nin previous weeks, it has seen\ndelays, hiccups, and errors that\nhave caused snorts of derision\naroundcampus.Withthisinmind,\nwe suggested to the College and\nthe Department that they open the\ndoors to the department to show\nus a renovation that is nearing\ncompletion, and also to open up\nabout the challenges that they\nhave faced and the reason why\nthe renovation has experienced\nso many problems. They agreed\nand last Tuesday I found myself\ndonning a high-vis jacket, a hard\nhat, and a pair of rugged black\nboots that wouldn\u2019t look out of\nplace at a Slayer concert, to head\ninto what is very much an active\nconstruction site.\nI\u2019m with Steve Howe,\nDirector of Capital Projects\nand Planning, Tim Venables\nthe Operations Manager for\nMechanical Engineering, and\nSteve Martin, Operating Officer\nfor the Faculty of Engineering.\nWhen I first meet them, the\nsense of \u2018you\u2019ve been writing\nabout us\u2019 hangs in the air, but\nthey\u2019re relaxed, the worst of\nthe renovation is past them and\nthey\u2019re looking forward to the\nwork being completed in July,\nwith students moving back\nin the months following \u2013 as\nSteve Howe puts it, people are\nusually miffed while the work is\nongoing, but then appreciate the\nproduct when it\u2019s completed.\nThe renovation of levels zero\nand one of the Mechanical\nEngineering building was always\ngoing to be fraught with difficulty.\nCombine a technically difficult\njob with a bunch of extremely\nintelligent PhD students whose\nwork has been disrupted and\nyou\u2019re likely to see tensions rise.\nErrors such as the building of a\n\u00a33 million exhaust system with\ngalvanised steel \u2013 meaning that\nbefore long the warm corrosive\ngases that it is supposed to vent\nwould degrade it \u2013 were met\nwith disbelief by Mechanical\nEngineers; one can imagine them\nshaking their heads and saying\n\u201cbut it\u2019s so obvious!\u201d\nBut not always. Take for\nexample a problem they\nencountered with a large\nhydraulic oil pump that\ncaused vibrations throughout\nthe building when turned on.\nIn January the problem was\ndiscovered \u2013 noise could be\nheard in lecture theatres \u2013 and\nit wasn\u2019t until April that the\nproblem was fixed when better\ndamping was installed on the\npumps. Why wasn\u2019t it foreseen\nthat a pump would cause\nvibrations that moved through\nthe building? There\u2019s an almost\nidentical machine in Skempton,\nwhich had the same type of\ndamping (and had been installed\nby the same contractor), that\ndidn\u2019t create any problems at\nall. From the College\u2019s point of\nview, there was no evidence to\nsuggest that the Mech Eng pump\nwould behave any differently.\nAs we walk around I see the\nlittle and not so little hiccups\nthat have caused delays. The\ninfamous \u00a33 million exhaust\nsystem looms above our head.\nThey\u2019ve almost completed the\ncorrective work on it but as\nexpected won\u2019t tell me what the\nliability could be; with lawyers\ninvolved Steve Howe is careful\nnot to say anything that could\njeopardise Imperial\u2019s chances of\ngetting the best deal possible. I\nask about the sound-proofing in\nthe engine testing labs and am\nconveniently pointed towards\nthe label on the wall which says\n\u2018sound insulation\u2019.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the\nDepartment and College\nhave taken pains to correct\nall the problems that they\u2019ve\nencountered. Indeed the new\nlabs are impressive and the\ninvestment shouldn\u2019t be tainted\nby the difficulties that they\u2019ve\nfaced \u2013 these truly are modern,\nworld-class facilities. The pivotal\nquestion is why were so many\nproblems encountered and what\nhas been learnt?\nThereisofcoursetheobligatory\nexplanation that construction\njobs are often overrun and that\nthe reason that you always have\na contingency fund is because it\u2019s\ninevitable that something\u2019s going\nto crop up. But as Steve Howe\nhimself notes, the College have\ndelivered projects under-budget\nand early before, why not this\none?\n\u2018The work that we\u2019re asking\nthe designers and contractors to\ndo is technically difficult. It\u2019s\npushing their boundaries\u2019, says\nSteve. Tim Venables concurs\nwith him pointing to the fact\nthat building a mechanical\nengineering lab is far more\ndifficult than renovating a\nlecture theatre. Although neither\nof them say it explicitly, there\nseems to be a sense that the\ntechnical complexity of the job\nperhaps wasn\u2019t fully appreciated\nfrom the start. Steve Howe says\nthat in future they\u2019ll be taking\na much finer tooth-comb to the\nspecifications and requirements\nof each room and involve more\nin-house specialist expertise.\n\u201cWe know that there\u2019s a need\nto scrutinise the use of each and\nevery room in a very detailed\nway to understand exactly what\nis required.\u201d He adds, \u201cin the\npast we\u2019ve expected the designer\nor contractor to bring in their\nown specialists in areas where\nits needed, but in future I think\nthat we\u2019re going to be doing that\non our end regardless\u201d.\nPut his comments into the\ncontext of the renovation and\nthey\u2019re hardly surprising. All of\nthe parties involved probably\ncould have a done a better job in\nensuring that the finished product\nwould be exactly fit for purpose.\nTo Imperial\u2019s credit, where\nthey\u2019ve identified shortcomings\nthey haven\u2019t simply sat on their\nhands. This is a \u2018better late than\nsub-standard\u2019 situation.\nSo what to think of this \u00a336\nmillion refurbishment? Certainly\nthe disruption caused to PhD\nstudents shouldn\u2019t be ignored;\nit\u2019s hard not to sympathise with\nthem when you see slightly\ncramped facilities that they\u2019re\nusing while they wait to move\nback into the proper labs. There\nare hints that the delays have\ncaused friction between the\nDepartment and the College, but\nagain that\u2019s hardly surprising.\nThe College has recently applied\nfor planning permission to\nmodernise the exterior of part\nof the Mech Eng building by\ncladding it in aluminium, and\nI get the impression that when\nthe renovation is completed and\nthe lessons have been learned,\nthat any acrimony will fade into\ndistant memory. Except for the\nexhaust \u2013 that\u2019ll probably be a\nrunning joke in the Mech Eng\ndepartment for quite some time.\nA section of a new undergraduate teaching lab...\n...Compared with the old labs\nThe College have submitted a planning application to clad parts of the\nexterior of the building in aluminium\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

The Chair of the working\nparty, Professor Dorothy Griffiths, said\nthat departments would still be expected\nto schedule a one-hour lunch break.\nChanges would be made to umanities\ntimeslots to ensure that students are not\nimpeded from taking humanities classes\nby lunchtime lectures or labs. Under the\nproposals extra timeslots would be created on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday\nevenings from 17:00\u201319:00. Deputy\nPresident (Education) Alex Dahinten,\nwho sits on the working party, reassured\nUnion Council on Monday 6th June that\nstudents with club or society activities\nthat clashed with their humanities classes would be accommodated on a \u2018oneon-one\u2019 basis where possible.\nThe proposals also include relatively\nminor changes to exam timeslots. Instead of morning or evening exams, there\nwould be three timeslots: 09:00\u201312:00,\n12:00\u201315:00, and 15:00\u201318:00. Dahinten\nassured Union Council in his report that\nthere would not be more than two exams\nper day and that \u2018exams will not be in\nsuccession\u2019 under the proposals. Professor Griffiths said that students would not\nbe expected to take a late exam followed\nby an early exam the next morning, but\nshe added the caveat that \u201cin departments which offer a lot of choice and\nhave complicated exam schedules\u201d these\nguidelines may be breached. She emphasised that this would only happen in\nrare circumstances and that it would be\nfor departments to work with individual\nstudents in those cases. Also, Saturday\nexams would be allowed in exceptional\ncircumstances \u2013 the example given is\nthe eruption of the Icelandic volcano\nEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull last year that caused disruption to the exam schedule. Professor\nGriffiths made clear that Saturday exams\n\u201cwill not be a regular feature of exam\nschedules\u201d and that the need to use the\nGreat Hall would not be a good enough\njustification for Saturday exams.\nThe proposals are a response to the\ngrowing difficulty of timetabling classes due to limited space on campus. In\nJanuary this year departmental administrators spoke of the need for more flexibility in the timetable to allow them to\ngive students more choice and reduce\nthe congestion in timetables. Professor\nJulia Buckingham told Felix that the\nCollege is \u201capproaching a limit on the\nteaching space available for all the activities undertaken day to day\u201d.\nEarlier proposals to extend the College day in the morning and evening\nwere dropped after widespread opposition from students and staff.\nThe College is also working to make it\neasier for departments to book rooms in\nother departments as part of their efforts\nto ease the pressure on timetables. There\nwon\u2019t be any changes to the College day\nnext year, if passed the proposals would\nbe implemented for the 2012/2013 academic year at the earliest.\nKadhim Shubber\nNEARLY THERE\nAn apology to Maggie Dallman: Page 2\nEditorial: Page 16\nFelix tours nearly-finished Mech Eng\nlabs as College speak frankly about\nrenovation difficulties: Page 4\nImperial College London\nKadhim Shubber\nRector\u2019s awards\nfor \u2018excellence\nin teaching\u2019\nannounced\nDr Jane Saffell: \u2018Outstanding\nInnovation in Teaching\u2019\n19 academics\nhonoured: Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 27 MAY 2011 31\nBOOKS\nFELIX\nBooks Editor: Guo Heng Chin\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe small, dusty and cramped environs of the Imperial College Science Fiction Library may serve as a\ntrue reflection of how the genre is valued and viewed\nby many... and this is the science fiction library of\nthe country\u2019s leading science university. The tiny\nlibrary houses over 7000 books and 1000 films: extrapolate those figures to get a more realistic size of\nthe realm of science fiction on a global scale.\nDespite its geeky connotations, science fiction\npervades all manner of media around us, and has\ndone so for millennia. From Thor and Inception\nto Lucian of Samosata\u2019s True History dating back\nto the second century AD, which tells of a group\nof explorers visiting strange lands and then being\nlifted to the Moon via a waterspout.\nAnyone who claims not to enjoy science fiction is probably lying... or at least unaware of the\nmyriad of themes, premises, styles and storylines\nit encompasses. If you search hard enough through\nthe back catalogue of books and films you have en-joyed, you may be surprised at how many could be\nclassified as such.\nUpon uttering the words \u201csci fi\u201d, it is easy to immediately conjure images of aliens or scenes from\nStar Trek. And, undoubtedly, these fall very much\nunder the category of sci-fi. As humankind devel-ops, time moves forward and technology progresses\nso too does the types of science fiction we create.\nIt helps us confront ethical issues associated\nwith the exponential expansion in our scientific\nknowledge and the added responsibility to planet\nand people it entails. It lets us come to terms with\nuncomfortable truths and uncomfortable potential\ntruths; it gives us free rein to philosophise about\nthe nature of reality and our place in the world; it\nallows denizens living under authoritarian governments to satirise and question the status quo; and,\nin a very Freudian way, it gives us an arena in\nwhich to escape and act out \u201cillicit\u201d fantasies.\nUtopia is still a thoroughly contemporary con-cept. Both it and its opposite, Dystopia, have\nbeen a subject of investigation in fiction such as\nAldous Huxley\u2019s outstanding Brave New World\nand George Orwell\u2019s 1984. However, the word\nwas coined around the time of King Henry VIII\nby Thomas More, one of his loyal advisors, in a\nbook he wrote describing the political system of an\nimagined world.\nCyrano de Bergerac also dabbled in the world of\nthe fantastical. His 1657 book, Le Autre Monde: ou\nles \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune (The Other World:\nThe States and Empires of the Moon), Cyrano travels to the moon on a rocket powered by firecrackers\nto meet its inhabitants. One hundred odd years later\nand vehement supporter of civil liberties, Voltaire,\npublished Microm\u00e9gas \u2013 recounting the tale of a\nbeing who visits earth from another planet.\nMore modern sci-fi offerings include the epic\nDune by Frank Herbert in which he creates in infinitesimal detail another world: replete with all the\ndetails of its own political, cultural, religious and social practices. Whether your interests lie in the sci-entific, the romantic or the aesthetic, Dune is guaranteed to enrapture you on at least one dimension.\nWhat the world will be like in the future is another fascination of science fiction. Before the flurry\nin technological development of the 1700s, life did\nnot alter greatly from generation to generation. The\nScience fiction, but not as you know it\nCaroline Knight\nLondon Literature Festival\n30 June \u2013 14 July\nSouthbank\u2019s annual summer literary festival brings\ntogether some of the best homegrown talent, a\nlarge repertoire of worldwide literature, fresh pieces from young and emerging authors, and a dash of\nalternative literature; so whatever your tastes are,\nyou are bound to find something there.

The\ncomplete opposite is true now. Cormac McCarthy\u2019s\nhighly acclaimed book, The Road (also made into\nan intensely moving film by John Hillcoat starring\nViggo Mortensen), gives us a harrowing vision of\na post-apocalyptic earth.\nA copy of the Daily Mail from the early twentieth century, but dated Saturday 1st January 2000,\ngives a snapshot of how people (or at least Daily\nMail editors) thought Britain might be at the turn\nof the millennium. Yet more interesting is William\nHeath\u2019s illustration March of Intellect, depicting\nthe Grand Vacuum Tube Company\u2019s (grand vacuum tube) running from London to Bengal and an\napparently steam powered carriage \u2013 London to\nBath in 6 hours \u2013 among many other new fangled,\nfuturistic inventions of Heath\u2019s imagination.\nThe above are but a few small rays of light that\nthe British Library\u2019s Out of This World exhibition shines on the super genre.

    "content": "G\noogle \u2013 a name we all\nknow. I\u2019m sure that the\nmajority of you use one\nof the internet giant\u2019s services on a near-daily ba-sis. They of course burst into popularity\nwith the now almost ubiquitous search\nengine, and have since made inroads\ninto many areas of our digital lives. So\ntheir annual Google I/O event would\nusually have technology buffs salivating over what exciting new technologies\nmay be announced. However, this year\u2019s\nevent may not have been so widely an-ticipated, especially with some of their\nreleases in the last couple of years having a less than pleasing reaction.\nA fading edge\nFirstly there was Google Wave \u2013 an\nonline, real-time collaborative commu-nication/editing tool that was first announced at I/O two years ago. It didn\u2019t\nseem to me to really bring anything to\nthe table \u2013 I couldn\u2019t really see a real-world application for it. But everyone\nwas raving about Wave \u2013 initial reactions to the service were positive, with\ninvitations to the beta incredibly popu-lar. However, it soon became evident\nthat there was little to do once the initial\nhype had passed, and Google failed to\ncome up with a solid use. To this end,\nGoogle announced just over a year later\nthat development on the service had\nceased due to lack of interest.\nSecondly, a little over a year ago,\ncame the infamous Google Buzz. The\nsocial networking and messaging tool\ncame under fire almost immediately due\nto privacy concerns, with the first lawsuit coming just one week after Buzz\u2019s\nrelease.\nMany users were outraged by some of\nthe default settings, which revealed people they often emailed and automatically posted their current location. While\nthis was probably the main factor in the\nservice\u2019s lack of success, it didn\u2019t appear to have a unique or innovative feature to its name; instead it just seemed\nto be attempting to rival Facebook. Additionally it seems odd to me that Buzz\nis mainly integrated with Gmail. Surely\nif you\u2019re logged into Gmail, your first\nthought if you wanted to talk about or\nshare something with a contact would\nsurely be to email them?\nInnovation lost\nSo why does it seem that the once\nseemingly-untouchable Google started\nto struggle? It cannot be ignored that\nthe company is huge, with over 26000\nemployees. With a business that large\ncomes an inevitable amount of bureau-cracy. That in turn makes it more difficult for new, innovative ideas from non-managerial employees to make it into\nthe world as a Google product.\nFor example, those ideas that originate in engineers\u2019 twenty per cent time\n(and Gmail was one of these) would\nprobably never make it past their computers today.\nOn top of that, it\u2019s possible that this\nwill have a knock-on effect on new applicants to the corporation \u2013 budding\nnew software engineers with idea-filled\nheads may start looking elsewhere in\nfear of not having their innovations\neven considered.\nMore of the same?\nBut perhaps there is hope for Google\nto shed their previous failures in the\nnewly announced products at this\nyear\u2019s I/O. Although their Android\nmobile operating system is success-ful, it looks like they need another big\nwin to get rid of any negativity. So it\u2019s\nworth a look at the two main services\nannounced this year \u2013 Google Music\nand Chromebooks \u2013 to see if they may\nprovide this boost.\nFirst up is Google Music, an online\nmusic streaming service with a bit of\na difference. Unlike existing services\nsuch as Spotify and Grooveshark, you\ncan only stream music which you have\nuploaded to Google\u2019s servers. Although\nthe company is in talks with record labels and wishes to release its own music\nstore, at the moment the invitation only\nbeta seems more like just a music storage solution. And while you can cache\nsome songs for offline listening, you\ncannot re-download any of the songs\nyou put up there, effectively tying you\ninto the service should you lose your\nlocal copies of the tracks. From this, I\nstruggle to see why people would switch\nfrom their current streaming provider.\nThe other main announcement this\nyear was Chromebooks \u2013 Google\u2019s\ncoined name for netbooks running their\nChrome operating system. There don\u2019t\nseem to be problems with the software\nitself \u2013 it sounds like it does what it\u2019s\nsupposed to do quite well (as long as\nyou can work within its internet only re-strictions) \u2013 but there doesn\u2019t seem to be\na solid reason for people to move to the\nnew platform. Even the hardware might\nbe fighting a losing battle, as netbooks\u2019\npopularity has waned.\nThe main selling point Google seem\nto be going with is the price, but even\nwith that there doesn\u2019t seem to be much\nof an advantage. The netbooks range\nfrom $350 for the wi-fi version of the\nAcer Chromebook, to $499 for the 3G\nenable Samsung Series 5. To compare,\nyou can get an HP Windows 7 netbook\nwith a decent specification for $449. Alternatively, Google is offering a monthly subscription based system, primarily aimed at the business and education\nsectors, with fees ranging from $20 to\n$28 per month depending on the model.\nThese do come with a three year contract however, and if you need 3G data,\nyou\u2019re going to need to add $20 a month\nfor an extra 1GB to bolster the paltry\n100MB included with the base cost. In\nperspective, a three year contract with\nthe cheaper netbook and 1.1GB of 3G\ndata a month will cost $1440, which\nisn\u2019t very cheap.\nSo it seems that although their new\nproducts have some interesting features,\nthe day may not yet quite be saved.\nWith Google trying to be dominant in\nso many digital markets, perhaps even\nspreading themselves too thinly, it\u2019s\neasy to forget the products that made\nthem famous. They may be starting to\nlose their edge already, a dangerous possibility in such a fast moving sector.\nChris Bowers asks if Google may be losing its innovative edge\nY\no\nu\nT\nu\nb\ne\nOne stumble too many?\n\u201cBudding new\nsoftware engineers\nmay start\nlooking elsewhere\nin fear of not having\ntheir innovations\neven considered\u201d\nLizzy Griffiths\nFELIX 13\nTECHNOLOGY\nFRIDAY 27 may 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n16\nCOM M ENT\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 27 may 2011\nL\nast week\u2019s Felix headline\nannounced that I accused\nProfessor Dallman, the\nPrinciple of Natural Sciences, of lying to the College Council. Those are not the exact\nwords that I used (I said she lied to\nthe Union President and misled College Council), but the implications are\nlarge and it is worth explaining what\nhappened.\nThe restructure of Life Sciences began in July 2010 when College Council approved a document initiating the\nrestructure; this document gives the\noverall objectives of the restructure and\nwhy they are necessary. The July meeting of College Council is in a period\nof handover for the Union, so both my\npredecessor and I were present. Ashley asked Professor Dallman what the\neffect of this restructure would be on\nteaching and on the current structure\nof the courses. She replied by saying\nvery clearly that there was no intention\nto change academic programmes in the\nDepartment or reduce their content and\nthat students in the Department should\nnot be unduly affected.\nWhen the names of the staff being\nmade redundant were released it was\nclear that these promises were not going to be kept. The meeting in SAF\nwhere over 400 people came to see the\nexplanation of the restructure showed\nthat this was true, with the majority of\nquestions relating to the loss of favourite teachers affecting courses. Prof.\nDallman and Prof. Owens brushed\nthese questions aside and said that\ncourses would not be affected. It was\neven said that teaching would be made\nbetter after the restructure was com-plete.\nWhat then happened in December left\nmost people extremely frustrated. With\nthe knowledge of the redundancies and\nthe projected impact on courses, the letters from other Universities and Institutions and the comments from Imperial\u2019s\nown staff members made public, we\nasked Senate to suspend the restructure.\nThis, as we know, was not successful.\nWhat did happen though, was another\npromise by Professor Owens. He said\nthat he did not \u201canticipate a reduction\nin module choice for students\u201d and that\n\u201cthe quality of student teaching and experience will only be enhanced by the\nplanned changes to its courses\u201d. Considering that this statement was issued\nwhen the redundancies were known\nand many academics were saying that\ncourses would suffer, it can only be\ncalled clueless.\nWhat it did in the meeting however\nwas to stop there being any real debate\non whether the effect of the restructure\non teaching was justified and what it\nwould be. By repeatedly denying that\nthere will be any change at all Professors Dallman and Owens neutered a\nproper discourse with students and staff\nalike until the real changes were known,\nand by then it was too late to reverse the\nchanges.\nWe are now nearly at the end of the\nTeaching Review, a separate process\nwhich does not involve Professors Dallman or Owens, and which has looked\nat the overall teaching in Life Sciences,\nbut has also had to apply academic First\nAid to a suite of modules and course\nchoices which were suddenly rendered\nimpossible with the losses encountered\nin the restructure. There were a lot of\nother suggestions that came out in the\nTeaching Review, many of which are\nto be welcomed and the panel accepted\nand changed some of the plans after students and staff gave feedback. This was\nBroken promises\nan encouraging sign, as no such system\nof taking account of feedback occurred\nin the restructure. What was obvious\nfrom the Teaching Review document\nwas the effect of the restructure on final\nyear Life Sciences modules, and that\nby the time the new intake of students\nreach their final years, approximately\n17 modules currently available will not\nexist.\nThere is a clear difference here between what Professor Dallman said\nwhen she initiated the restructure and\nwhat has actually happened; and what\nhas happened was nearly entirely under the control of the restructure panel,\nand Dallman and Owens in particular.\nTo have spent several months considering the outcome of the redundancies\nand to come to the apparent conclusion\nthat nothing will be affected either suggests that they weren\u2019t thinking very\nhard or that they deliberately misled.\nEither way, it does not say much about\nthe accountability of College Council if\na process they started can be concluded\nunder such different circumstances to\nthose promised.\nCollege Council haven\u2019t delivered on the teaching review\nAlex Kendall\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\nn\nn\nt\n\u201d\nWhat happened in December\nleft most people extremely\nfrustrated\nThe search for a solution to the College\u2019s\ntimetabling troubles continues. It is heartening to hear that the College are making\nefforts to make cross-departmental room\nbookings easier, but it is fair to say that altering the makeup of the day will be a part\nof the solution. The latest proposals from\nthe College Day Working Group are a step in\nthe right direction and are worth examining\nin a little detail.\nThe most important change is the eradication of the formal two-hour lunchbreak that\nwe currently enjoy. Instead of this universally sectioned-off time of day, we will see\ndifferent departments scheduling classes\nfrom 12\u20131, or from 1\u20132. The question to be\nasked is not whether this will alter College\nlife to a lesser or greater degree, and the\nburden of proof is not to show that this will\nnot have any negative impact; the question\nis whether this reduces the pressure on allocating teaching space enough to justify\nthe downsides.\nWhat are the downsides? Students from\ndifferent departments and faculties may\nhave timetables that do not allow them contact at lunchtime. Of course the more serious impact of this is that it will be more difficult for clubs and societies, and students\ngenerally, to organise meetings during the\nlunchbreak. Additionally some of those students taking Humanities courses will be\nforced to take their classes in the evening\nfrom 5-7.\nOn the other hand, offering more timeslots to departments will give them more\noptions when scheduling classes. Which in\nturn will allow them to give students more\noptions when choosing courses. This is undoubtedly a good thing and furthermore, if\nwe accept the need to offer departments\nmore flexibility, then we must recognise\nthat this solution is far preferable to oth-ers; thankfully the idea of starting the day\nat 8am and ending at 7pm was abandoned.\nAt face value then, we believe that this\nproposal is not a bad idea. The others are\nso sensible or minor that they hardly warrant debate \u2013 allowing exams to be held\non Saturday in exceptional circumstances\nis obviously better than having the end\nof your exams pushed back because the\nexam-period \u2018weekend\u2019 is off-limits. There\nis some way to go before we see any real\nchanges (though it is getting frustrating\nto be constantly reminded that these are\n\u2018only proposals\u2019; a phrase that ignores\nthat \u2018proposals\u2019 have a way of becoming\nconcrete when you\u2019re not looking). What\nis essential is that the detail is not over-looked. Students and staff rightly want to\nbe assured that the proposals cover all\nthe bases and that they will have a proper\nopportunity to voice their opinions. If this\nproves to be the case, then Felix will support the changes.\nFELIX\nLunchtime\u2019s over\nIn December, hundreds of students turned out to protest against the Life Sciences restructure\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n18\nCOM M ENT\nFriday 27 MAY 2011\nThe media\u2019s grief is\nhypocritical\nLast week, a young Belgian cyclist died\nwhile competing in the Giro d\u2019Italia (the cycling tour of Italy). In a downhill section he\nlost control of his bike and was thrown off,\ntumbling down into a ravine. His death was\nmet with dismay and sadness within the cycling community and the following stage of\nthe race was not taken into account as part\nof the overall ranking and was transformed\ninto a procession in his honour. Sports papers and websites took it upon themselves\nto write emotional and gripping accounts of\nhis life and death.\nMostly this process of grieving was done\nwith respect and was certainly genuine.\nHowever, isn\u2019t it exaggerated for the mass\nmedia to publicise such an event, for journalists to write epitaphs as if they were personally involved? Compassion is one thing,\ngenuine sadness and loss another.\nWhile the mass media turn the story of a deceased biker or a murdered policeman into\na front-page article, thousands of people\ndie anonymously everyday. And when one\norgy of empathy and sadness is over, the\nnext dish is served, wiping away all memory\nof the previous event. The fact that human\nbeings are prey to strong emotions is not\nin any way criticisable, on the contrary it\nis what makes us who we are. Emotions\nare the basis for any form of achievement;\nemotions are what make us human. What\nis wrong is the constant need to feed on\nwhat we feel, to extricate all meaning and\nturn emotions into a means for pleasure.\nThe media is partly responsible for this\nstate of things, but they are an industry and\nan industry lives on what people buy. The\nultimate stupidity lies with all of us who happily give time and money to feel sad, happy,\nintrigued, etc. about something that has\nnothing to do with us. Empathy is human,\nbut it should be directed at the people who\nsurround us.\nWe stand hand on heart and grieve, silent\nfor a minute, when we are told to and we\nsmile and party when others think that we\nshould (an obvious example of the latter being the Royal Wedding) but at the same time\nwe run the risk of squeezing all meaning out\nof our emotions. In the same way we say\n\u201cthank you\u201d or \u201csorry\u201d without taking stock\nof the meaning of what we say, simply because we have been taught to, because it\nis the correct thing to do and in the process\nwe annihilate the meaning of the words we\nare saying.\nWe are all so clean and clinical, so politically\ncorrect that we forget the profound meaning\nof things.\nI\n\u2019m sure you\u2019ve suffered the same experi-ence. You\u2019re at a restaurant, the food you\u2019ve\nordered has arrived and you tuck in. Thirty\nseconds later, a waiter will come across and\nobsequiously ask if everything is alright.\nSince there hasn\u2019t been the time for anything to\ngo wrong, you nod politely and thank them. They\nthen disappear and leave you to eat the rest of your\nmeal in peace. But they remain absent even once\nyou\u2019ve finished and are, in a moment of weakness,\ncontemplating dessert. They will have been gone so\nlong by the time you ask for the bill, you wonder if\nthey ever existed in the first place. When you are\nstill waiting at the end of the evening when they are\nwiping down the tables, you convince yourself that\neveryone, not only the waiter, has completely forgotten about you.\nAs I begin the long walk home (I may have been\nwaiting so long the Tube stopped running) the question plagues me. Why, wherever I go, do the waiters\nask if I\u2019m alright at the start and abandon me for the\nrest of the meal? I believe I may now have the answer\n\u2013 restaurant waiters exist in the fifth dimension.\nMortal folk like you and me exist in three dimensions of space, in which we move freely, and one\ndimension of time, in which we\u2019re limited in a linear fashion. I\u2019m not quite sure why I\u2019m explaining\ndimensional physics to Imperial students. I\u2019m going to get so much hate-mail for this \u2013 or worse,\ncorrections. Waiters have another dimension to call\ntheir own, meaning they are no longer limited to one\nsecond per second time-travel as we are \u2013 they can\nmove as freely as we move through the first dimension of space.\nRestaurants\u2019 management mandate that waiters check on their customers in case something is\nwrong. Training for what to do in such an unlikely\nsituation is only provided for senior staff but the important thing is that they check. Unfortunately, the\nwaiters don\u2019t think of us, those handicapped to four\ndimensions. Since they move freely in time, one moment is as good as the next to them. So they check\nwith us at the start, to make sure they do it, and then\nconsider their duty discharged. Since they can come\nto the table at any moment and we respond that everything\u2019s fine, they assume that everything is fine\nin every moment. With such blissful ignorance, they\ndon\u2019t think to check again and I am left waiting at\nthe end of the night with a dust-sheet over my head.\nThough I\u2019ve solved this conundrum, more questions still remain. Are waiters naturally five-dimen-sional, or do they grow into it? Is there an aptitude\ntest? Conversely, do five-dimensional people naturally orientate towards waiting tables? What do they\ndo when they\u2019re not checking on my table? Does it\ninvolve wrangling dinosaurs? I\u2019ll get back to you\non this one.\n\u2026or maybe I already did.\nSam Horti\nL\nast week I offered my thoughts on why\nI believe Nick Clegg\u2019s stance on the tuition fee policy was requisite, citing the\nessential maintenance of government\nstability. This week, we have seen the\nLib Dem leader chance his arm on the other side,\nand I think he will find out that the grass is decidedly less green. I am of course referring to his open\nchastising of the NHS reform plans set out by the\ncoalition.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the plans are clearly fraught\nwith problems, and need to be sent back to the\ndrawing board. I find it very troubling that our\nPrime Minister has the audacity to say, in the face\nof enormous opposition from experts in the field,\nthat the strategy is sound. It shows a tremendous\nlack of deference to bodies such as the Royal College of GPs, who have decried almost every aspect\nof the plans.\nMy own observation is that the proposed reform\nis simply change for change\u2019s sake. Every time he\nhas been confronted on the matter, Mr Cameron\nspends more time emphasising the need to modify\nthe NHS than he does addressing the specifics of the\nproposal. His reluctance to comment on the details\nof the reform plans leads me to believe that he himself knows that there are huge problems that need\naddressing. He simply cannot muster up the courage\nto admit it.\nWith all that in mind you may quite reasonably\nquestion how I can possibly criticise Nick Clegg. I\nam not taking exception towards his assertion that\nthe plans must be altered, but towards his timing.\nIt\u2019s been a bad week for the coalition, with calls\nfor Ken Clarke to resign, economic warnings from\nVince Cable and questions about Chris Huhne\u2019s in-tegrity. Taking this into account, Clegg\u2019s remarks,\nwhich suggest further divides in the Government,\nare at best remarkably untimely.\nSecondly, I must query his motives. It is conve-nient, is it not, that he stands up to Cameron so soon\nafter his promises of \u201cmuscular Liberalism.\u201d Why\nso capricious? Why did he not object to these plans\nat a much earlier stage? I\u2019m sure he cares greatly\nabout the NHS, and doesn\u2019t want to see it go to ruin.\nHowever, his objections emit a pungent scent of\nself-interest, fuelled by his sudden desire to put the\nLib Dems back on the political map.\nSome may consider this a feasible tactic. He is,\nafter all the leader of a party under heavy fire. Be\nthat as it may, he must concentrate his efforts on\nencouraging a stable government for the good of\nthe country. I applauded the fact that his stance on\ntuition fees achieved that aim. On the issue at hand,\nI cannot pay the same compliment. As an isolated\nincident, it may amount to no harm. It may in fact\nbenefit us all if it helps steer the Tories into a U\u2013\nturn over the NHS reformation plans. Nevertheless,\nif Mr Clegg starts to make a habit of these public\ndisplays of objection, he may find himself on an increasingly slippery slope which leads to a Government that cannot even agree with itself.\nThis coalition has to hold itself together for a further four years. If Nick Clegg doesn\u2019t want to see\nit crumble, he needs to think seriously about where\nhis loyalties lie.\nRhys Davies\nMake your mind up, Clegg\n\u201cSince they move\nfreely in time, one\nmoment is as good\nas the next to\nthem\u201d\nExtra dimensions of service\n\u201cWhy did he not\nobject to these\nplans at a much\nearlier stage?\u201d\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Placing in the top 3 teams\nwould guarantee a place in the National\nChampionships in June. The team met\nearly at Waterloo, and after seemingly\nbeen fraudulently sold the wrong type\nof group discount ticket, headed off to\nSouthampton where the South East England Championship would be played.\nOur first match was against Winchester Bullets 1s. We expected a comfortable start to the event, as we were\nclear favourites, but after a number of\nmistakes in the nervous opening exchanges we found ourselves 2 games\ndown. We were in serious danger of\nfailing to qualify from our group.\nClub captain, Alan Soltani, was\nsomewhat distressed at this point. The\nWolverines had never in the past won a\nmatch (5 games) from two games down.\nThe third game was close, but we were\nbuilding our confidence and making\nfewer mistakes, and as a result we won.\nBack to our usual capabilities we won\nthe 4th game, with Alan and Adam Cutmore making a trademark simultaneous\ncatch.\nOnly one game left to make Imperial\nCollege dodgeballing history. It wasn\u2019t\none for the faint hearted. At one point\nwe were 6 players to 3 down, but we\nmanaged to secure a win thanks to a vital catch by Tom Peake, bringing Alan\nback in to finish them off.\nNext match was against Portsmouth\nCobras C. It was a match to enjoy and\nrelax, we won 5-0, boosting our confidence further before the most difficult\nmatch of our group vs Knights.\nWe had a team talk in a separate gym\nto raise team morale and clarify tactics;\nwe knew our chance of success against\nKnights was slim, as they had previously beaten us fairly comfortably. Just\ngiving it our best shot, and fresh with\ntwo matches already won, we gave it\n...Continued on Page 39\nImperial\u2019s Wolverines unable to qualify for National\nChampionships after suffering heartbreak in Southampton\nWolverine\u2019s National\nChampionships hopes dashed\n\n"

Continued from Back Page\nLast weekend the home of English\nrugby, Twikenham, hosted the penultimate round of this year\u2019s International\nRugby Board international rugby sevens tournament. Sevens is a variation\non the fifteen-a-side traditional Rugby\nUnion game, which, as the name suggests is played with seven players on\neach team.\nThe IRB international sevens series\nis played in a eight different countries\nincluding Dubai, Hong Kong and the\nfar less glamorous location of Scotland.\nPerformances in each of the different\nstages are combined in order to crown\nan overall series champion. The series is\ninto its twelfth year with New Zealand\nwrapping up their ninth overall title following a strong performance in London\nthis weekend a week before the final\nround of games to be held in Scotland.\nThe tournament has four prizes of\ndecreasing importance; the cup, plate,\nbowl and shield. Such a system means\nthat a poor showing on the first day of\nthe tournament will allow a team to\ncompete on the second day albeit for a\nmuch less coveted prize.\nEngland had been in contention to\nchallenge New Zealand for the overall\nseries crown however; their hopes were\ndashed following a poor show during\nthe first series of matches on Saturday.\nEngland\u2019s team boasted Ben Gollings,\nthe highest points scorer in the history\nof sevens, but even he nor the huge\nhome support within the stadium could\nprevent England falling to a shock 21-14 defeat to France.\nFollowing this below par performance\nEngland could only manage a 12-12\ndraw with Argentina in their final match\non Saturday, which prevented them\nfrom progressing to the quarterfinals of\nthe cup for the first time this year. Due\nto England\u2019s inability to reach the later\nstages of the cup, the onus was very\nmuch on New Zealand who had qualified for the cup quarterfinals to be held\non Sunday with a perfect record. TheAll\nBlacks knew that because of England\u2019s\ndismal showing a strong run in the cup\ncompetition would provide them with\nthe overall series title.\nNew Zealand eventually succumbed\nto the power of Fiji in the semi final\nof the cup, despite their obvious disappointment at not being able to contest\nthe final, the All Blacks took some consolation in the fact that they had secured\nthe overall title.\nFiji themselves fell in the final to their\nsouthern hemisphere neighbours, South\nAfrica.After trailing the Fijians 14-0 the\nSouth Africans turned the game around\neventually coming out on top 24-14 giving them their second cup crown of this\nyear\u2019s series and their first on English\nsoil since 2005.\nSamoa. who were the overall series\nwinner in 2010, have had a poor season\nby their standards yet managed to overcome Australia in the final of the plate\nto salvage some hope of a turnaround\nnext year.\nScotland overcame Kenya in the final of the bowl thanks to a last minute\ntry from Andrew Turnbull leaving the\nKenyan team, strongly backed by the\nTwikenham crowd, heartbroken. The\nKenyans had earlier in the day deal England a further blow by knocking them\nout of the bowl competition, leaving\nthe hosts to scrap for the shield crown\nwhich they duely won beating Portugal\n22-7 providing the only silver lining in a\ndrab weekend for the host team.\nDespite the obvious disappointment\nat England not putting on a more convincing display of their prowess at sev-ens, the crowd seemed unperturbed. A\nrecord 54,357 people turned up on the\nSaturday followed by over 50,000 on\nthe Sunday resulting in this being the\nWolverines fall at last hurdle\nNew Zealand beat\nEngland to overall\nSevens crown\nmost attended tournament since the series began twelve years ago. The theme\nset for the tournament was \u2018beachwear\u2019\nmeaning that thousands of people\ndecked out in bikinis, Bermuda shirts,\nand wife beater vests descended on HQ.\nThere were reports that some supporters enjoyed themselves a little too much\nwith a male known only as \u2018Ross\u2019 taken\nin an ambulance from the South stand\nof the stadium after downing excessive\nquantities of alcohol.\nIRB.com\nDavid Wilson\nwhat we could. To everyone\u2019s surprise\nwe came out victorious, 3-2! Another\nIC record smashed \u2013 until then we had\nnever beaten a higher ranking team in\nour league!\nThe last game in the group stages vs\nUnderdodge B we won 4 \u2013 1 thus meaning we finished top in our group and\nsetting up a semi-final against Southampton 1s, the home team. By this time\nwe were tiring and, outmatched, we lost\nbadly 4-1. However, in the third game\nof the match Alan and Adam again impressed the crowds with another double\ncatch. Our last hope now of qualifying\nfor the Nationals was to beat Fellows\nAppreciation Society, a team of ex-Warwick Uni players, in the 3rd place\nplayoff.\nHaving watched our previous games\nand noted our reliance on good catching play, they wisely concentrated on\nnot giving our catchers the opportunity\nto do what they do best, and so threw at\nour other players. This made the games\ndifficult for us, not being able to make\ncatches or play efficiently. We put up a\ngood fight, but finally lost 4-1. We headed back to London with our heads held\nhigh, happy with our performance albeit\na little disappointed in not being able to\nqualify for the national championships.\nAlso, we would like to give a special\nmention to Dan Price for stepping in at\nextremely short notice!\n\n"

The wardening review\nran from May 2010 to March 2011 and\non comparing Imperial\u2019s wardening\nprovision with other universities found\nthat the ratio of wardening staff to\nstudents at Imperial was significantly\nhigher than at comparable institutions\n(1:30 at Imperial vs. 1:84 at UCL, on\naverage).\nIt was decided that halls with a ratio of\n1:31 or less would have a reduction of\none subwarden beginning in 2011/2012,\nwith the caveat that no hall should have\nless than four wardening staff. The\nreduction will see the average ratio at\nImperial rise to 1:34.\nThe recommendations note that \u2018the\nCollege\u2019s very favourable Wardening\nratios make an important contribution to\nthe halls system\u2019 but argues that \u2018some\neconomies in the budget are necessary\u2019\ndue to the current financial climate.

In 2005,\nConservative MP Jonathan Sayeed\nwas expelled from the Tory party\nfor profiting from private tours of\nParliament.\nFelix contacted Greg Hands, who\nclarified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t give any\nsuch tour\u201d and Hansard, a record of\nproceedings in Parliament, confirms he\nwas leading a Westminster Hall debate\non Russia on that date for the hours at\nwhich the tour was supposed to have\ntaken place.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 27 may 2011 27\nGAMES\nprobably use source control? You know,\nall these kind of things, which I think\ncomputer science departments are now\nsort of adding to their arsenal of skills\nto know about when you go into the in-dustry. But certainly when I was here,\nin computing there was a lot more emphasis on the theoretical aspects, which\nactually come up very little in most programming jobs.\nYou said you worked in the financial\nservices industry. A lot of people at\nImperial are quite focused on finance;\nthey\u2019re trying to get the big money\nand the big status. Now that you\u2019re\nnot in that industry, do you wish that\nyou were, or do you think that you\u2019ve\nmoved to a better place?\nI wouldn\u2019t go back unless I felt that\nwhat I was doing was changing stuff for\nthe better. I\u2019m in some sense privileged\nto have seen the precursor to the 2008\ncredit crunch, and I actually worked\non a project to help a bank trade more\nmortgage-backed securities and derivative products thereof, in America in\nsummer 2007. At the time people were\nsaying: \u201cyou don\u2019t know how it works,\nbut trust us, it works\u201d. So having been\nthere and realising that no-one really\nknows how it all works, I would have\nto feel like I was improving the lives\nof people rather than treating quality of\nlife as an externality for other people to\nworry about.\nObviously LittleBigPlanet is now a\nhuge phenomenon. What does it feel\nlike to look at that and say: \u201cyeah, I\nhelped that become what it is\u201d?\nI\u2019m really proud of what we\u2019ve\nachieved. I think none of us really knew\nhow successful it was going to be when\nwe launched. I think it\u2019s just amazing\nwhat people have done with LittleBigPlanet. It just gives me great sense of\npride, really. It also scares me a bit that\nwhen we go on to do something else\neverything\u2019s going to be compared to\nLittleBig Planet, obviously. The old sec-ond-album syndrome! But it\u2019s just great\nto have been there at that time and to\nhave gone through that whole process;\nreally, it was an honour.\nIs there anything that you feel happened at Imperial, or anything about\nImperial specifically, that helped you\nin your career?\nI would say academically, not so much\n\u2013 that\u2019s not Imperial\u2019s fault, it\u2019s more\nmine for not paying attention. But I\nwould say that being surrounded by\nbrilliant people and the resources to\nplay with stuff really helped to build\nan inquiring mind. And I felt that when\nthere\u2019s so many people around you, doing such great things, you start to realise\nthat anything\u2019s possible, or what you\nthought was impossible may not actually be impossible. I don\u2019t know how\nyou\u2019d write that down succinctly, but\nit\u2019s sort of the sense of opportunity and\nof things being achievable \u2013 problems\nare tractable.\nIf you had one tip for someone at Imperial wanting to get into the games\nindustry, what would it be?\nMake games, or make things to do with\ngames, or talk to people in games, or\nplay games, or \u2013 sorry, one tip? Do what\nyou love, and get it in front of people \u2013\nthat\u2019s still two tips!\nSo what did you study at Imperial?\nI did Computing, graduating in 2006. I\nthen started doing a PhD and then got\nlured away by the games industry after\n1 year of that \u2013 I never completed it. I\njoined Frontier in 2007 and I\u2019ve been\nworking there ever since, so yeah, that\u2019s\nabout three and a half years now.\nWhat did you start your PhD in?\nIt was actually in city generation for\ngames. The first year I did research into\nthat sort of stuff and just had little demos of things. The main idea was to use\ngenetic algorithms to try and generate\ncities that were aesthetically pleasing\nand fulfilled requirements. But, I never\nfinished that so I probably shouldn\u2019t talk\ntoo much about it!\nSo you started your PhD and then got\nlured away - what was it that lured\nyou away?\nI guess I always intended to go into the\ngames industry at some point. I suppose\nI had this impression that it was very\ndifficult to get into \u2013 I tried to actually\nget an industrial placement as part of\nmy course with a few different games\ncompanies, and they all basically said\n\u2018no\u2019 without even considering me. They\ndidn\u2019t look at my CV or anything. It was\njust, \u201cno, we don\u2019t do placements\u201d, so\nthat gave me the impression that it was\ngoing to be pretty tough. When I was\ndoing my PhD I attended one of these\n[GaME] events back in 2006, and David\nBraben, who\u2019s the founder of Frontier,\nwas giving a talk and I talked to him\nafterwards about it and he said, \u201cwell,\nyou know, come and do a placement at\nFrontier\u201d. Initially it started as a placement and I just continued working there\nafterwards, much to the disappointment\nof my supervisor.\nYou said you always intended to go\ninto the games industry, but when did\nyou first feel that that was what you\nwanted to do?\nProbably from six or seven years old!\nI used to play tonnes of games, I still\ndo play a lot of games. It was always\nsomething I was interested in \u2013 I learnt\nto program in BASIC and Pascal fairly\nearly on. I was a bit disappointed that\nat school there weren\u2019t many opportunities to do that sort of thing, but it was\ngreat to then come to Imperial and learn\nhow to program properly, with good de-signs. So, it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve pretty\nmuch always wanted to get into.\nYou also said that as a student you\nhad this impression that the games\nindustry was hard to get in to. Do you\nstill think that, or has that changed?\nMainly I thought it was difficult because\nwhen I tried to get an internship during\nmy undergraduate I found it so difficult.\nI think a lot depends on catching development teams at the right time, because\nif they\u2019re right near the end of the project and they\u2019re just trying to get this\ngame out, they\u2019re probably not going to\nwant to take on a new person and train\nthem up. I think it\u2019s just understanding\nwhen companies are realising games\nand making sure that you\u2019ve asked them\nearly enough. Obviously you need to\nbe a good programmer \u2013 when I joined\nFrontier there was a programming test\nI had to pass. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that\ndifficult and if it\u2019s something that you\nreally want to do then it\u2019s just a case of\napplying to lots of different companies\nand hoping that one of them takes an interest and takes you on.\nWhat\u2019s your role at Frontier?\nI mainly work on two things. We have\nthis tool which allows our animators to\nput their animations in the game and set\nblend weights and stuff like that. I do a\nbit of work on that, and I help animators set up all that stuff, and I make sure\nthat our back end animation system is\ndoing whatever it needs to. The other\nmain thing I work on at the moment is\n\u2018avateering\u2019 [full body tracking] related\nstuff, which is basically mapping what\nyou\u2019re doing in front of Kinect onto a\nvirtual character in the game and making sure it matches your actions very\nclosely. Most of this requires obviously\ndoing quite a lot of programming in\nC++. We do a fair amount of scripting\nin Lua as well, but also a lot of the job is\ntalking to animators and designers and\nartists, and making sure that what they\nwanted to see in the game actually ends\nup in there, and just supporting them to\nmake the game hopefully look as good\nas it possibly can.\nIs there anything you did at Imperial\nthat you feel was advantageous or dis-advantageous?\nI guess Imperial [computer science]\nteaches you a broad range of subjects,\nand most of them do end up being useful in different ways. Just learning how\nto do good code design and different\ndesign patterns and stuff like that was\nreally helpful. One thing at the time was\nthat Imperial didn\u2019t teach C++. I think\nthe computing department now does\nhave C++ course in the second year, but\nI might be wrong about that [he\u2019s not].\nThat\u2019s something that always surprised\nme \u2013 that a lot of universities don\u2019t\nteach C++ despite it being one of the\nmost popular languages out there.\nSo you feel that it\u2019s mainly your\ncourse that got you where you are?\nYeah, before I came to Imperial I knew\nsome programming but my design was\nterrible, and it really got me to appreciate\nhow if you\u2019re working in a large team of\npeople you do have to put care into your\ndesign and make sure you code is reusable and stuff like that. That\u2019s probably\nthe main thing that the university course\nteaches you \u2013 getting you out of all the\nbad habits that you pick up if you teach\nyourself how to do things.\nWhat sort of things would you say to\npeople at Imperial who might have\ndone a bit of programming and might\nbe interested in getting into the games\nindustry but aren\u2019t computer scien-tists?\nI would probably say that they shouldn\u2019t\nbe put off by the fact that they\u2019re not\ncomputer scientists. Frontier does actually hire a lot of people from other disci-plines. Normally when we hire someone\nwho isn\u2019t a computer scientist, we will\nshow them exactly how we set the code\nup and make sure they don\u2019t feel uncomfortable or like they\u2019re being asked to do\nmore than they can do, but at the same\ntime they probably should make every\neffort to try and learn C++. It\u2019s an incredibly complex language, probably too\ncomplex for it\u2019s own good sometimes.\nWhen I got there, I just read through the\ncode base and saw how people were doing stuff and copied that, and just built\nup from there. It didn\u2019t take long to do\nthat. Obviously it helps to know other\nlanguages beforehand, so try to learn a\nlanguage in your spare time and go from\nthere. But don\u2019t be put off by it!\nA lot of Imperial students seem to be\nfocused on finance, and big money.\nYou obviously didn\u2019t take that route\n\u2013 are you glad you didn\u2019t?\nYeah, definitely. I know quite a lot of\npeople who work in consultancy and\nfinancial roles, and they tell me about\nthe stuff that they\u2019re working on and it\u2019s\ndefinitely not something that would interest me very much. I like to work on\nthings which are graphical, and where I\ncan see this product on shop shelves and\nsee people enjoying playing it. I think\ngames is a really creative thing to be part\nof, and even if you\u2019re doing a really scientific part of it the creativity still spills\nover into what you\u2019re doing. Working\nwith artists and designers is really en-joyable, and I don\u2019t think you get that\nsort of experience working for a bank or\na purely software company. That\u2019s why I\nreally like the games industry!\nFor any student wanting to get into\nthe industry, have you got any other\ntop tips?\nIt\u2019s definitely beneficial I think to have\na demo of your work. I didn\u2019t(!) when\nI applied, which is maybe why I found\nit difficult to get internships beforehand.\nCertainly if you can show them stuff\nthat you\u2019re working on, just to show\nthat you have this interest and you can\ndo this stuff, then that\u2019s always good!\nMarc Hull\nfrom Frontier Developments\n\u201cWorking with artists\nand designers is\nreally enjoyable,\nand I don\u2019t think\nyou get that sort of\nexperience working\nfor a bank or a purely\nsoftware company\u201d\n\n"

Through\nthis role I have learnt that while\nthe majority of Imperial is very\n\u2018LGBT friendly\u2019, it can sometimes be difficult for fresh-ers who are not \u2018out\u2019, or who\nface abuse & \u2018banter\u2019 which\ncan make them feel unsafe\n(whether physically, or emo-tionally) in their own home.

Back home, the concerns of the various communities are handled with utmost\ncare and their differing views\nare constantly taken into account\nin decision-making.

    "content": "I\nt\u2019s the 1st of May and Star Slinger is playing Camden Rock at the\nCamden Crawl. The room is rather\nsparsely populated and despite the\nbest efforts of this \u201cone man beat\nmachine\u201d, as he was described by\nPitchfork, the sound system just\nisn\u2019t playing nice this evening. At the end of\nhis set a crowd approach the DJ booth, my\nfriend is the first to reach him and proclaims\nobnoxiously, \u201cCan I have a hug?!?\u201d Star\nSlinger peers at him through his long brown\nhair with a slightly confused face and has\nevidently misheard him, \u201cThanks but I don\u2019t\nneed a hug.\u201d When my friend clarifies, Star\nSlinger reconsiders for a moment, and then\ngives him a full-bodied embrace.\nI\u2019m reminded of this exchange when interviewing Star Slinger a week or so later. He has\na very personal online presence, talking to fans\non his Facebook page and his Twitter, and posting his personal email account on his website\nto allow fans to contact him directly. I ask him\nwhat he thinks of getting fan emails and first he\njokes that sometimes they\u2019re \u201creally \u2018fan-ish\u2019\nand you imagine them being a dork or something.\u201d But then thinks about it for a moment\nand goes on to say, \u201cBut I guess I\u2019m a dork re-ally. I remember being that kid who was really\nfan-ish and I usually give people a little reply\u201d.\nSuch is the duality of the artist Star Slinger,\nwho is easily the hottest act of the year, and\nthe man behind the music, Darren Williams,\nwho describes himself as \u201cthe kid with decks\nat school\u201d who wanted to be in with every\ncrowd and open his ears to the full spectrum\nof musical genres.\n\u201cI wanted to be a bit of a wide boy and be\ninto everything\u201d, he says, explaining that\nhe DJ-ed with the \u201cchavvy kids\u201d while also\nplaying guitar with the \u201cgeeky rock kids.\u201d\nHis desire to be diverse is a thread that runs\nthrough his music today. His debut album Volume 1 is an eclectic mix of danceable tunes\nthat demonstrate his ability to tease, stretch,\nand chop samples into exciting new sounds.\nArtists often stick to one sound, and when\nthey try to change direction it\u2019s often badly\nreceived because people aren\u2019t used to it, he\nargues. \u201cWith electronic music it\u2019s easier to be\neclectic. Especially if you sample, it\u2019s easy to\nshow that your music taste is vast rather than\nnarrow.\u201d But his love of sampling goes deeper\nthan simply showing off his musical knowl-edge: \u201cI like making the most of something,\na six-second clip [\u2026] those parts of a record\nthat want to be heard more.\u201d\nIn that sense Star Slinger is as much a music\nlover as he is a musician. His Facebook page\nis full of other artist\u2019s songs that he wants\nto share with his fans. \u201cI try to fill my ears\nas much as possible. I think you\u2019re lacking\nsomething if you\u2019re not listening to music,\u201d\nhe says confidently, before taking himself\ndown again, \u201cbut maybe if you read books\nyou\u2019ve got one up on me because maybe\nyou\u2019ve learnt more.\u201d\nT\nhe speed at which he has made a name\nfor himself is quite astounding. He\nonly started putting his music online\nand sending it to music blogs last June. (The\nfirst blog to really big him up, a Swedish site\ncalled No Modest Bear, called Volume 1 \u2018a\nstunning instrumental album\u2019). Come 2011\nthe Guardian were calling him the \u2018best new\nact of the year by miles\u2019. To put it bluntly, if\nFELIX Friday 27 MAY 2011 25\nMUSIC\nyou play someone a Star Slinger track, 9 times\nout of 10 they\u2019re going to love it. He counts\nDiplo and Donald Glover among his celebrity fans and the queue of artists asking for\nremixes stretches out the door and around the\nblock \u2013 he\u2019s applied his deft touch to tracks\nby musicians as disparate as Broken Social\nScene, Gold Panda, and Nicki Minaj.\nHe says that he does his producing when it\u2019s\ndark. \u201cI like to save the night for it. I\u2019ll think\nabout it in the back of my mind all day. I\u2019ll\nalready know what vibe I want.\u201d When I point\nout that his music sounds summery rather than\nBurial-esque he simply shrugs and says \u201cI\u2019m\nnot so conscious about time really. I think everyone\u2019s got their own fucked up sleeping pattern\u201d, adding that having a job without a strict\nmorning timetable helps.\nRecently Star Slinger posted a somewhat\ncryptic message on his Facebook: \u2018It\u2019s dope\nto be humble.\u2019 When I ask him about it he explains that he realised that he was biggin\u2019himself up a bit too much. But it\u2019s understandable\ngiven his meteoric rise. \u201cTo me it\u2019s still crazy\nthat I\u2019m getting so many plays,\u201d he says. \u201cI\nnever thought I would get the success that I\nhave had. Everyone self-deprecates after uni-versity, there are so many opportunities but so\nmuch competition.\u201d\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how grateful for his\nsuccess he is. He\u2019s not blas\u00e9 about his life at\nall. I ask him about giving music away for free\non the internet and he points out that most of\nthe music he puts out isn\u2019t free. He\u2019s been paid\nby a record label to do the remix. \u201cPeople just\nthink that you\u2019re a hobbyist putting out free\nmusic, but I\u2019m not a hobbyist, this is my job.\u201d\nI ask him if he still works and he looks at me\nseriously before pointing out, \u201cThis is work.\u201d\nA\nfew weeks later he\u2019s playing at Stag\n& Dagger festival, headlining at the\nQueen of Hoxton. It\u2019s as far from\nthe gig at Camden Crawl as imaginable. The\nplace is packed and the crowd is dancing like\nthey\u2019re in an R. Kelly video. When I talked to\nhim he described the music that he loves as\n\u201clush, full and wholesome\u201d and the music that\nhe makes as danceable music \u201cfor conscious\npeople, not just for mindless fist punching\u201d.\nWith the crowd\u2019s energy driving him on, his\nset is a perfect synthesis of those two ideas.\nHis set isn\u2019t completely perfect, there are a\nfew hiccups along the way as he experiments\nwith new tunes, but to use the words that he\nused to explain his respect for Diplo: \u201cA DJ\u2019s\nset doesn\u2019t have to be smooth and perfect,\nit\u2019s more about the buzz that they create.\u201d\nThe buzz at the Queen of Hoxton is huge.\nThe crowd start shouting out remixes from\nhis extensive catalogue. One title stands out\namongst the noise, his remix of \u2018Marriage\u2019 by\nGold Panda. There\u2019s that customary pause\nfor thought, the initial step back when he says\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually play it live.\u201d But as the calls\ngrow louder and refuse to desist, he probably\nremembers being a kid obnoxiously shouting\nout song names at a gig and relents.And as the\nbells at the start of the remix give way to the\nbassy fuzz underwriting the track, the crowd\npractically explodes.\nSTAR SLINGER\n\u201cIf you play someone\none of his tracks, 9\ntimes out of 10 they\u2019re\ngoing to love it\u201d\nKadhim Shubber\nprofiles this year\u2019s\nhottest artist\n\n"

I\u2019m\nHamza, a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering\nundergrad, competing for the\nprestigious position of RAG\nchair. My motivation to volunteer in RAG is simplistically\ndefined; to improve the participation rate in this noble cause.\nMy inclinations to serve as\nRAG Chair are not unfounded.\nBeing a part of the hall senior\nteam last year in Pembridge\ntaught me to embrace the essence and importance of team\ndynamics. Throughout my time\nat Imperial, I have volunteered\nfor various charity causes including the Haiti earthquake,\nPakistan floods, collections for\nbone marrow transplant for\nchildren (in collaboration with\nI\n\u2019ve been heavily involved\nin RAG, never passing up\nan opportunity to get stuck\nin and raise money, and I feel\nit\u2019s one of the very best things\nabout being at University- combining charity with our student\nurges to dress up and have fun.\nIt takes mass-involvement for\ngood causes to a new level - we\nlearn about many charities and\ncauses and our actions do the\nsame for the general public.\nIf elected, I will--Be willing to listen to ideas\npeople have and if possible,\ntry to make them happen.

It is concerned with\nthe fundraising events that are\non offer.\nBeing a regular with the RAG\nevents I know what events are\non offer, have my personal\nview on what is deemed successful and which areas could\nuse improvement. The job is\nsuch a virtuous act and one that\nshould be made more accessible and widely acknowledged.\nUpon entering Imperial, I was\nelated to find out that fundraising is established and attempted\nto partake on as many events\nas possible. I was honoured to\nUCL) and the recent tsunami\ntragedy which occurred in Japan. It was through these past\nexperiences, I was able to understand how serving MechSoc\nas a Secretary could render me\nuseful in my stride to make a\nmarked difference in the lives\nof Mechanical Engineering students at Imperial, by providing\na lubricant between the members and the committee, as well\nas an avenue of feedback pertaining to any improvements.\nApart from the famous RAG\nweek, I would be keen on organising more exciting activities such as bungee jumping\nand hitchhiking for charity for\nthe adventurous ones out there.\nFurthermore, I shall be keen on\narranging more social events\nto accommodate all the years. It\nis imperative, that as your Chair, I\nwill work closely with you, in order to realise the vision for RAG.\nI sincerely look forward to serving\nyou as RAG Chair. Please, lend me\nyour support and believe in mine.\nHAMZA SHAIKH\nposters in all departments to\nadvertise the events and, if pos-sible, in halls\n-Hold a comedy night and talent competition\n-Get IC RAG on facebook\nand twitter\n-Keep in constant contact\nwith (as they\u2019d put it, pester)\nand aid where possible the\nmedics through use of the RAG\nmailing list, hall reps and publicity\n- Go to as many first year\nlectures as possible in freshers\u2019 and leading upto the RAG\nweeks to raise awareness about\nRAG and its events\n-Use the (un)friendly rivalry\nbetween the Faculty Unions\nmore, through increased attempts at mascot theft and competitions through the year\n-Increase incentives for Halls to\nraise money, maintain good contact with their reps and hold meeting with them before RAG weeks,\nand I\u2019ll seek permission to publicise events in halls\nJACK HEWITT\nbe involved in various charity\nand voluntary events.
