Why did you have\nto sabotage it all by taking\nshots at Yeezy? Now, beef is\nnothing new in the Hip-Hop\nworld but, as with the recent\nDrake-Cudi conflict, it\u2019s the\ntiming and targeting of these\ninsults that\u2019s suspect. Why\ngo after him now, when he\u2019s\nbeen hospitalised? And why\ntarget his mental health? Cole\nfalls into the classic trap of\npainting Kanye\u2019s struggles as\nsomething of his own doing.\nHe paints West\u2019s issues as\ndeliberate manifestations of\nan over-indulgence of ego,\nrather than recognizing that\nlikely the inverse is true. It\nwould stand to reason that,\nperhaps, this projection of\nego is an attempt to mask\ninsecurity and depression,\nand ridiculing it publicly\nwould only serve to worsen\nit. You either don\u2019t get this, or\nare deliberately ignoring it.\nNot cool, Jermaine. Oh, and\nas an aside, if you\u2019re going to\ngo after one of the greatest\nproducers of all time, don\u2019t do\nit on a recycled Joey Bada$$\nbeat.\nAnurag Deshpande\nProblematic faves | J Cole and Jesse Hughes\nJ\nesse Hughes,\nfrontman of the\nEagles of Death\nMetal, is a fairly\ntough nut to crack.\nEoDM\u2019s music can\ngenerally be described as a\nlighter, more pop-like take\non Queens of the Stone Age.\nSo, it came as somewhat\nof a surprise to me when I\ndiscovered that Jesse Hughes\nwas a full-on gun toting\nright-wing Republican. Now,\nthis didn\u2019t really bother me\nat first because he kept his\npolitics to himself and didn\u2019t\nactively support any of\nthe crazies. However, the\nBataclan incident changed\nall that. Hughes has since\nmade comments that could be\nconstrued as islamophobic,\nand has taken the bizarre\nalt-right stance of blaming\nliberalism for terrorism. Given\nthe traumatic experiences\nhe\u2019s had, and given his\nhistory with drug use, I\u2019m\ninclined to somewhat forgive\nthis behaviour. But, I can\u2019t\ndeny that his views have\ncoloured my feelings about\nthe music. Sure, I\u2019m all for\nseparating the art from the\nartist, and I still enjoy the\nmusic; just, perhaps a little\nless than I used to. Another\nthing to consider is that music\nis, at the end of the day,\ncommercialised art. Jesse\u2019s\nmay say some suspect things,\nbut he\u2019s been through a lot\nand, at the end of the day,\nhe\u2019s pretty harmless. So, I\nplan to keep listening: at least\nfor now.\n\\\\ Cole falls into the\nclassic trap of painting Kanye\u2019s struggles\nas something of his\nown doing \\\\\nFeaturing food from several of Imperial\u2019s overseas and\ncultural societies, enjoy flavours from around the globe!\n\\\\ I discovered that\nJesse Hughes was\na full-on gun toting\nright-wing Republican \\\\\nReflections Of My Life\nWith this 1969 hit, Marmalade show that sad music isn\u2019t just\nabout introverted arrangements. The song\u2019s sweet vocal harmonies and triumphant trumpet parts contrast with its bleak lyrics.\nThe backing vocals in this song are a real highlight adding texture to an otherwise simple song.\n\\\\ Paul Padshewscky\nTiegan Neary \\\\\nGot those pesky January blues? Exam stress getting you down? Bask in your own sweet, sweet\nself pity with this playlist from our very own Rob Garside.\nMoving onto the more melodramatic side of sad, The Cure take\nus into the wilderness that is Disintegration. With the disconcerting glass smashing samples, unwavering drum machine and self\nindulgent vocals, the song is weirdly mesmerising. If you like\nthis sort of thing but fancy something more dynamic check out\nConverge\u2019s cover. Jacob Bannon\u2019s murmured vocals swirl in\nthe background before building up to a shouted climax.\nDisintegration\nSylvia All That Could Have Been\nThe whole of The Antlers\u2019 concept album Hospice is pretty sad, with\nits stark storyline playing out amongst an ambitious, multi-faceted\nindie rock soundtrack packed with stellar musicianship. This mid-tempo\nsong drifts between acoustic guitar segments and electronic passages\nbefore a restrained climax. So much of this song hinges on the croon\nof Silberman, which carries the narrative, sweetly juxtaposing the\nhaunting lyrical content of this song.\nThe continuing success of NIN is directly due to bringing\nindustrial themed music to the mainstream through the use\nof clever hooks amongst militarist drum beats. One of their\nballads, this track has a disconcerting structure that allows\nthe song to build and build. The confessional self analysis\nof this of this song makes it one to pay attention to.\nInterludio\nI often find the process driven side of minimalist music too mechanical to be fulfilling, yet Luciano Cilio\u2019s work is beautifully restrained\nso that even a small raise in volume is meaningful and chilling. From\nthe beautiful mandolin lead that opens the record to the wordless\nvoices and desperate cello lines, this record excels in creating a\ndepressive atmosphere.\n\\\\ hannah k\n29-95.com \\\\\nWhen Bastions confirmed their hiatus towards the end of last\nyear, one of the great lights of the UK hardcore scene was extin-guished. The combination of using clever, efficient songwriting\nand the cathartic, tortured screams of their lead vocalist Jamie\nBurne helped them create vivid emotional soundscapes.\nMurmuring\nThe Man Comes Around\nThe Show Must Go On\nJohnny Cash\u2019s American series with Rick Rubin is a stripped\nback, heavily reflective album, showing a slower, darker, more\nreligious side compared to Cash\u2019s previously more comedic and\nupbeat works. Written in the last years of his and his wife\u2019s lives,\nCash\u2019s deep, sombre voice is the main focal point throughout.\nQueen\u2019s finest moment in my eyes is their final album. Written\nduring Freddie Mercury\u2019s deterioration due to AIDS, the whole\nalbum is informed by his gradual acceptance of his approaching\nend. Mercury\u2019s vocals as usual are on point, ably assisted by\ndramatic harmonising backing vocals. Despite the triumphant feel\nto this song, it is still heartbreaking to hear.\nRob\u2019s Sad Playlist\n\n"

(Blue like hands without\ngloves flaunted at passing strangers on the\nstreet. Wait what?) By now you\u2019ve come to\nterms with the fact that you probably spent\nway too much money over Christmas. You\u2019ve also\nbeen spending a disproportionate amount of time in\nbed, barricading yourself with every piece of spare\nlinen you can get your hands on, trying to stave off\nthe cold that Snowmageddon has brought. You\u2019re also\ninvoluntarily taking part in dry January, because you\ncaught a nasty bug and are on antibiotics, while at\nthe same time praying that it\u2019s not some untreatable\nsuperbug you\u2019ve got and that dem sweet meds are\nactually working.\nYou successfully emerged from the worst Monday\nblues of the year only to be met with Theresa May, the\nUK\u2019s new iron lady, making chilling claims about the\nsingle market, the hard Brexit and the Library Cafe.\n(Wait no. I think I dreamt that last bit. I mean that\nwould explain how nobody seemed to care that I was\nbeing served a jacket potato with chilli con carne and\ncheese by the Iron lady in her tighty whities.)\nAnd if you\u2019ve made it thus far, prepare for the event\nof the year (so far) \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s marriage to\nAmerica during the 45th\npresidential inauguration in\nWashington.\nBut wait. All is not wrong with the world. For starters\nkittens and puppies are still a thing. Also looks the\nCentral Library will be getting some air con! And sure\nyou might not be getting a cool study space to revise,\ndespair and meltdown till at least September but if\nhumanity survives till then, at least the Central Library\nwill be cool and breezy. Though if let\u2019s say \u00a313m have\nfailed to fix the library\u2019s thermal regulation we can\u2019t\nsay we\u2019re particularly optimistic that another \u00a313.5m\nwill.\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be so jaded though.

Confused?\nRead on.\nlike a dessert. The stalk was\nslightly sweet, the creamy,\ndistinct flavours of the goat\u2019s\ncheese cut through, assisted\nby a drizzle of honey. If you\nlove goat\u2019s cheese, you will\nfall in love with this dish.\nOur last savoury order,\nthe classic tortilla, arrived as\na circular, inch-thick cake,\ncreated under the watchful\neye of the chef who was constantly flipping the tortilla and\ntesting the temperature with\nhis hand. I understood the\namount of care that was put\ninto this dish as the golden\nyellow juices flowed out from\nthe centre as we cut it in\nhalf \u2013 the egg was cooked\nto retain a slight liquidity,\nencasing the flavourful onion\nB\nest friend in town?\nYou just have to\ntake them to one of\nthe best restaurants\nin town and order\nthree times your\nnormal portion of food \u2013 and\nroll out of the restaurant with\na six-month food baby hoping\nto \u2018walk\u2019 it off with a tube\njourney to the next.\nSo when my friend came\ndown to London all the way\nfrom Durham (for a breather,\nshe said), I got very excited,\nnearly as excited as those\nprimary school days when I\ncouldn\u2019t sleep before a field\ntrip, and started preparing for\nher visit. The key was coming\nup with a list of restaurants\nto take her to. This was easy\nwith our matching standards\nfor good food. And with a\nfew hours of discussions, we\nnarrowed it down to (drum-roll please):\nBarrafina!\nBarrafina is a mini-chain of\ntapas bars serving modern,\nauthentic, Spanish tapas.\nLanding its first site in Soho\nin 2007, it has gained a cult\nfollowing of hungry custom-ers, reflected by the hour-long\nqueues every day outside\nits doors, pages of heated\nreviews and a Michelin\nstar. With the opening of its\nsecond branch on Adelaide\nStreet in 2014 and its third\nbrand on Drury Lane in\n2015, its growth has been\nunstoppable, even under\nits no-reservation policy all\nthrough the years. If people\nare still queuing up after ten-odd years, you have to admit\nthis place must be good.\nUnder our anxiety issues\nand shared hatred of queues,\nwe dragged ourselves out\nof bed bright and early on a\nSunday morning, making it\nto the door of their Adelaide\nStreet branch a quarter-hour\nbefore the lunch session\nstarted. We were among the\nfirst to queue \u2013 perhaps the\nwintry winds and the January\ndrizzle were off-putting to\nsome.\nAfter 15 minutes of waiting\nin anticipation, we entered (or\nhappily skipped) through the\nglass doors into a brightly-lit,\nstylish room, and took our\nseats on the retro-looking\nred stools around a mar-ble-topped bar. On the bar\nwas their menus, with their\ntapas section on the left and\nvarious alcoholic beverages\non the right. We were also\npresented with a chalkboard\nmenu with their daily specials.\nFollowing the hours of\nresearch in the form of\nscrolling through Instagram, I\nchanted out our order to the\nwaiter behind the bar like a\nsorcerer, watching him key in\nthe names after a slight nod.\nOur dishes were made into a\nlist, thoughtfully sectioned so\nthey would be served in 2\u2019s to\na maximum of 3 at a time.\nAt Barrafina, all the waiters\nand chefs work behind the\nbar. We could see everything\nin action. I was amazed at\nhow they worked in such an\nefficient, flawless, almost-re-laxed manner despite the\nsmall space and during the\nbusy lunch hour: waiters\ntaking orders, serving food,\nchefs working at their respective stations.\nOur first dish came as\nswiftly as the wind outside:\na bite-sized fried oyster\nserved on an oyster shell with\ntheir signature crab croquetas\n\u2013 a pair of deep fried, golden\nbrown crab balls with a\ncreamy filling.\nWe let our taste buds savour\nthe after-taste of the starters\nbefore our special order\narrived: the carabineros\nprawn. This palm-sized prawn\nwas in a deep red colour, still\nsmoking hot from the pan.\nWe took care, nearly burning\nthe tips of our fingers, ripped\noff the head, sucked out the\nglorious juices, and greedily\nsavoured the tender meat. It\nwas a splurge for the wallet\nbut a luxury for the senses.\nThe arroz de marisco\nlanded on the table as we\nwere licking the prawn juices\noff our fingers. Reminiscent of\nthe traditional paella, the rice\nwas like a mountain of gold\nnuggets with mussels, clams\nand squid studded amongst\nit. The rice exploded with the\nessence of the sea.\nThe stuffed courgette flower\nwas a bit of a controversial\ndish between us. The flower,\nwith the petals and the stalk,\nwas the length of my hand,\nstuffed with goat\u2019s cheese\nand lightly fried. It was almost\nChristy Lam\na lime and chilli salsa. The\nhot, sweet, salty juices from\nthe oyster burst through the\ncrunchy tempura skin in the\nmouth. Next was the padron\npeppers \u2013 a staple dish at\nany tapas restaurant. These\npeppers came as a plate of\nbright green lanterns, gently\nfried and seasoned with\nsea salt. It wasn\u2019t greasy at\nall, and surprisingly sweet.\nEnding our first \u2018course\u2019 was\nbroth inside.\nIt would be a crime to leave\nBarrafina without tasting\ntheir signature dessert \u2013 the\nmilhojas. We added this to\nthe list even knowing our food\nbaby was entering the second\ntrimester. The milhojas looked\nlike a French millefeuille, but\nmuch better: two slices of\nairy, crispy puff pastry sandwiching a light vanilla cream\nand rich, indulgent, spiked\ncustard. The combination of\nflavours and textures was\nmiraculous.\nEight dishes, two girls with\ntwo food babies on a Sunday\nafternoon. What could be\nbetter?\n\\\\ Reminiscent\nof the traditional\npaella, the rice was\nlike a mountain of\ngold nuggets with\nmussels, clams\nand squid studded\namongst it \\\\\n\\\\ The hot, sweet,\nsalty juices from the\noyster burst through\nthe crunchy tempura\nskin in the mouth \\\\\nQuiteaninnocuous,andyetsurprising\nvegetable, the humble aubergine\n(or eggplant) is a versatile food for\nall manners of culinary pursuits, and\nothers.\nAubergines and their many uses\nY\nes, the aubergine\n\u2013 delicious in\ndips, smokey\nand rich, and\nyet equally\nat home in a\nspicy, lip-smacking curry, the\naubergine is a vehicle for\nflavour without compare. I\nthink my love affair began\nwhen I would take home small\nscoops of baba ghanouj,\na levantine dip of smoked,\nroasted aubergine, with\ntahini and lemon, after school\ninnumerable packed curry\nlunches that I faithfully took to\nschool \u2013 not that I can com-plain, for those curries were\nthe highlight of the week,\ncompared to the Thermos\nof Dal from which I usually\nsipped. So you could say that\nfrom my local turkish deli.\nSavouring the creamy, salty\nand yet slightly bitter paste,\nI was transported away from\ndeary England to an oasis,\nfilled with travellers from\nacross the desert, sharing\ntales and eating. What an\ninnocent, and dull, life I lived.\nIn a family that ate very\nlittle meat, aubergines were\nused to great effect \u2013 they\u2019re\na traditional northern Indian\nvegetable, and as such\nmade their way into the\nthe aubergine and I have\nquite the history \u2013 and to this\nday, it is still one of my favourite vegetables.\nAnd yet, some people are\nstill so afraid of purple beast\nthat they decry it as bitter, or\nseedy \u2013 allegations that are\nso rarely true in this day and\nage. I would encourage you\nall to venture forth and try the\nrecipe below with aubergines,\nas it really is very simple and\nmuch tastier than many of the\nkale and quinoa vegetarian\ndishes floating around.\nIf that doesn\u2019t take your\nfancy, however, I am reliably\ninformed that aubergines also\nhave a number of non-culi-nary uses, mainly as a sex toy\nfor the enthusiastic experimenters who have gone well\npast the root vegetable size,\nand are looking for something\nwith a bit more girth. I can\u2019t\ncondone these uses, but I\nadmire their efforts \u2013 some of\nthe aubergines I\u2019ve seen have\nbeen the size of my forearm.\nWhichever way you use your\naubergine, I hope you enjoy\nit.\nMelanzane alla Parmigiana\nA classic Italian dish, our esteemed\nchef presents her simple, student\nfriendly version. Cook it for that hot\nvegetarian girl on your corridor \u2013\nwho knows, she might come back for\nseconds?\nI\nstill can remember my\neditor\u2019s voice, before\nChristmas, saying that I\nmight want to try writing\nmore meaty recipes:\nquick and easy, student\nfriendly meat dishes. I can\neven see him smiling while\nhe reads this (maybe I should\nsay \u201cHello!\u201d) but well, this is\nanother meat-free edition.\nBut I have an excuse; I love\nall my vegetarian readers.\nAnd I have to think about\nthem every time I write an\narticle \u2013 finding subjects for\nyou, pretentious reader, is\nAndrada Balmez\ncomplicated to say the least.\nBut next week we will all have\nthe post-exams binge so you\ncan start saving some money\nfor that now.\nIngredients:\n4 medium aubergines\nknob of butter\n500 g mozzarella\nTomato sauce\n1 onion\n1 clove garlic (the bigger, the\nbetter)\n2 glugs of olive oil\nFresh basil leaves (just in case\nyou don\u2019t know that the edible\npart of the basil are the leaves\n\u2013 yes, I speak from my own\nexperience: some people don\u2019t)\n2 eggs\nParmesan (depends on how big\na cheese-fan you are)\nStart by slicing the auber-gines. They shouldn\u2019t be\nthicker than 0.5 cm and you\ncan cut them either on the\nlong side or the short one,\ngetting nice round slices.\nDepending on how good\nyour oven is \u2013 and if it\u2019s a\nhall oven probably not very\ngood \u2013 you might need to\npre-cook them a little bit.\nYou can either put them on\na single layer on a tray and\ncook them for five minutes in\na pre-heated oven at 175\u02daC\nor you can slightly fry them\nin a frying pan \u2013 one minute\neach side will do.\nChop the onion and the\ngarlic as fine as possible. Fry\nthem in the olive oil until the\nonions are golden \u2013 be care-ful, you want them golden,\nnot brown. Add the tomato\nsauce and stir on high heat\nfor five minutes.\nUse a pretty deep tray and\nspread the butter all over it,\nincluding the sides.

If\nyour tray is not very deep,\nyou might not finish them;\nremember that you want a\nbit of space left at the top of\nthe tray so that nothing will\noverflow. Try to have a last\nlayer of tomato sauce and\nmozzarella.\nOn the top, add some\ngrated parmesan and the\nbasil leaves \u2013 chopped or\nnot, depending on your\npreference.

While\nsome have no idea\nwhat they are, for others the\nword conjures up a vague\nimage of a hippo-esque\ncreature that adorns cutesy\nbottles and notepads. There\nis no particular reason to\ngo any deeper than these\nassociations, but it was during\nattendance at an interactive\nexhibit dedicated to all things\nMoomin \u2013 and when I say\ninteractive, I mean ducking\nthrough \u2018forests\u2019, crouching\nin a sandy tent, and wading\nthrough \u2018snow\u2019 \u2013 that the\ndepth of these children\u2019s\nstories, and their importance\nat times such as ours, came to\nlight.\nTove Jansson, the author\nand illustrator of the Moomin\nbooks, was born in Helsinki in\n1914. Becoming an artist and\nillustrator at a young age,\ndepictions of the Moomin\ntrolls can be seen in her early\nwork in way of a signature.\nThey soon came into their\nown however, with the first\nbook, The Moomins and the\nGreat Flood, appeared in\n1945. On the surface, these\nwere cute stories for children\n\u2013 a family (albeit trolls) looking for their father, Moomin\nPapa, who has disappeared\nin an adventure filled with\ndanger and crumbling\nfa\u00e7ades. However, take into\naccount the mood of the time,\nwhen so many fathers had\nBandler. The secret ruby\nwas their love, hidden away\nand illegal \u2013 as homosexual\nrelationships were in Finland\nat the time. Jansson poured\nher anxieties and her broken\nheart into her art. It is now\nour turn to do the same.\nThis is only one example of\nan artist putting their pain into\nart. Go to any art museum\nand you can see whole rooms\ndedicated to artists\u2019 creations\nthat stemmed from civil\nwar, emotional turmoil, and\nforcibly repressed feelings.\nThe simplicity and warmth of\nJansson\u2019s defiance, however,\nis what is striking here: she\nmade children\u2019s books that\ngave comfort to a completely\noblivious audience, whilst\nincluding deeply personal\nand political messages. The\nbeginnings were very small,\nwith the first Moomin Troll\nbeing drawn on the wall of\nher family\u2019s outhouse when\nshe was a child following an\nargument with her brother.\nShe described the doodle as\nthe \u201cugliest thing imaginable\u201d.\nHer uncle had warned her of\nTakingaleafoutofToveJansson'sbook\nJenny Shelley\ndisappeared to the war, and\na surprisingly political note\narises. In fact, Jansson\u2019s own\nbrother had \u2018disappeared\u2019 in\nthe war with no idea when\n\u2013 or even if \u2013 he would be\nback.\nThe following book, Comet\nin Moominland, tells the tale\nof a comet that forces the\nMoomins to gather together\nand flee their home. This,\nagain, was extremely reflective of the times. However,\nperhaps the starkest example\nof the use of her art form to\nexpress a piece of herself,\na piece of her pain, was the\ncreation of the characters of\nThingumy and Bob. These\ntwo were only ever depicted\ntogether with a stolen red\nruby \u2013 initially only referred\nto as \u2018the content\u2019 \u2013 hidden in\nthe suitcase that they carried\nwith them. By children\u2019s\ncharacter standards, this does\nnot seem so unusual or note-worthy. However, we now\nknow that this was Tove Jansson\u2019s way of expressing her\nfeelings towards her lover: a\nmarried woman called Vivica\nthe \u2018Moomin Troll\u2019, a horrible\ncreature that would catch her\nif it caught her sneaking out of\nbed to steal from the pantry.\nWhen she was young, she\nwas terrified of the Moomin,\nbut she overcame the demon,\ndeveloping ownership over it\nand creating the characters\nthat are now so well loved.\nThe advice from Carrie\nFisher, thrust forward in Meryl\nStreep\u2019s wonderful speech\nat the Golden Globes, rings\ncompletely true: make your\nbroken heart into art. But not\nhaving a giant platform or\nmany means of expression\ndoesn\u2019t make it of less impor-tance. Take what scares you,\nwhat breaks your heart, and\nturn it into something else,\nsomething you can overcome\nand maybe even befriend.\nNot all sources of heartbreak\ncan be turned into a cuddly\ncharacter (orange, wig-wear-ing Trump-in Troll anyone?),\nbut the ones that can are a\nsolid start.\n\\\\ The simplicity and\nwarmth of Jansson\u2019s\ndefiance is what is\nstriking: she made\nbooks that gave\ncomfort to an oblivious audience, whilst\nincluding deeply\npersonal and political messages. \\\\\n(L-R): Tove Jansson's Comet in Moominland; Jansson in the 1940s; the recent film adaptation of Moomins on the Riviera \\\\ Creative Commons/2014 Handle Productions\nI\nbet you're worried. I was\nworried. I was worried\nabout vaginas. I was\nworried about what we\nthink about vaginas,\nand even more worried\nthat we don't think about\nthem\u201d wrote Eve Ensler in the\nintroduction of The Vagina\nMonologues, a compilation\nof over 200 women\u2019s feelings\nabout their body and their\nsexuality. Ensler interviewed\nand talked with them about\ntheir vaginas: how do they\nperceive it? How they feel\nabout \u2018the vagina\u2019 in general?\nWhat would your vagina say?\nEnsler gave them the space\nto talk freely, and listened to\ntheir stories.\nIn this 90-minute play, the\nactors beautifully express stories of shame, fear, fantasy,\ndiscovery, happiness, relief,\nand anger. It almost feels like,\nthrough listening to their perceptions of their vaginas, we\nare able to meet the original\nstorytellers.\nWatching the performance,\nyou\u2019ll hear about plenty of\npussies, countless cunts, various vulvas, tonnes of twats,\nplus some punanis thrown in\nfor good measure. Some of\nthe monologues are based\non an individual woman\u2019s\nparticular experience: from\na hilarious piece on a sex\nworker who pleasures only\nwomen, to an eye-widening\n(and leg crossing) account\nfrom a witness of a birth, and\na strong testimony on the Bosnian war and sexual violence\ninflicted on women. Other\nmonologues are thematically\nand emotionally linked, with\nEnsler combining different\nexperiences together, such as\nthe powerful discussion of the\ntreatment of trans women by\nwider society.\nThe Vagina Monologues\nisn\u2019t an activist speech with\ncomplicated words, but rather\nmanages to be elegantly\nwritten without being exces-sive. The messages of these\ncombined pieces create a\nstrong, emotionally charged\nnarrative. It\u2019s funny and light\nhearted most of the time \u2013 a\n6 year old says her vagina\nsmells like \u201csnowflakes,\u201d and\nyou\u2019ll have to go see the play\nto hear what an ex lawyer\nsaid about moaning\u2026 \u2013 but\nbetween the joy and laugh-ter, you can also find sad,\ndespairing pieces about violence inflicted upon women.\nThe Vagina Monologues is\nsimultaneously an acceptance statement, an invitation\nto discussion, and a free\nexpression. It is a beautiful\nand artistic way to give back\nto vagina owners the power\nto speak and control what is\nsaid about their own body\nparts; to redefine and re-ap-propriate themselves.\nIt felt therapeutic to hear\nand read the script: as both\na spectator and actor in the\nplay, it brings me relief to\nhear this strong testimony\nabout what others have to\nsay about their vagina. While\nsome men might find it threatening or unnecessary, the\nplay doesn\u2019t aim to exclude\nmen \u2013 rather it shows them a\nrare, respectful portrayal of\nvaginal experience.\nIndeed, it is refreshing\nand cathartic to finally hear\nvoices break this taboo in\na non-sexualised, non-man-centred way. In the end, it is\nnot about vaginas, but rather\nabout everything that gravitates around them: the ideas\nperpetrated by our society;\nhow people are ashamed of\ntheir vagina; how people wish\nit was different \u2013 how they\nended up believing it should\nnot have hair, that its shape is\ndisgraceful, or that it naturally\nsmells bad. It is about how\ndifficult it is to discover and\nappreciate your vagina when\nit is physically hidden from\nyou.\nIn a culture where shaming\nfeels omnipresent, and general assumptions fit humans\ninto boxes, demanding a\ncertain body standard, relationship status, or orientation,\nThe Vagina Monologues\ninvites people to discuss and\nopen up about their feelings.\nEverybody should feel free to\nbe who they want and to love\nthe bodies they have. They\nshould not be told what to do\nwith it.\nHaving a vagina shouldn\u2019t\nbe a source of shame, or put\na target on someone\u2019s back.\nTo work towards greater tol-erance, Ensler chose the path\nof artistic expression, and as\nmore people read, watched\nand realised the impact of the\nplay, it became a worldwide\nmovement. In 1998, after\na success in New York, the\nauthor created \u201cV-Day\u201d (V\nstanding for Vagina, Victory,\nValentine), a worldwide activist movement staging the play\nin different countries in aid of\nthe struggle to end violence\nagainst women and girls. This\nmovement expands each year\nand poignant, game-chang-ing representation takes\nplace in countries where the\ncondition of women needs\nurgent improvement. Each\nperformance raises awareness as well as money for\nthese causes. The play continues to give these women\nthe power to talk, bringing\ngender equality back into the\nconversation.\nThis year, FemSoc and Imperial\u2019s student community will\nput on their own The Vagina\nMonologues in celebration of\nV-Day!\nIt\u2019s not too late if you want\nto play your part in this\nglobal movement so give us\na shout (feminist@imperial.\nac.uk) if you\u2019d like to get\ninvolved.

If you\nhad a small white pill\nwhich promised greater\nfocus and productivity\nwould you take it? The Tab\nwebsite conducted a survey\nof 2000 UK university\nstudents and discovered\nthat 1 in 5 have taken the\ndrug \u2018Modafinil\u2019. Many\nstudents take it to concentrate\nbecause they cannot cope\nwith the demands of their\ndegree. Furthermore, with an\nexpanding job market and\nstellar CVs, many students\ntake Modafinil to gain an\nedge over their competitors.\nModafinil is a drug that\nincreases wakefulness. It is\nstrictly prescribed to patients\nsuffering from ADHD, narcolepsy and sleep apnea,\nhowever recently more\npeople, especially students\nare taking them to study.\nSince Modafinil is not a\ncontrolled substance but can\nbe prescribed by a doctor,\npossessing it is not illegal,\nhowever selling it is. Many\nstudents purchase these drugs\nthrough unreliable pharmaceutical sources in India and\nMalaysia or through other\nstudents on campus.\nModafinil increases concentration whilst studying. The\nUniversity of Oxford analysed\n24 studies between 1990\nand 2014 and found that\nit boosted higher cognitive\nfunction, particularly attention\nand learning. It is known to\nenhance serotonin, histamine\nand glutamate levels which\nincrease an individual\u2019s level\nof alertness and short term\nmemory. One user needed to\ndraft a proposal for the Dalai\nLama Foundation but was\nsuffering from writer\u2019s block,\nbut after taking Modafinil was\nable to complete it. Online\ntestimonials have also highlighted that it induces weight\nloss and enhances moods.\nHowever, there are several\nproblems to Modafinil. Firstly,\nit can cause side effects like\nheadaches, depression, and\ninsomnia. This smart drug can\nseverely disrupt sleep patterns\nso that they receive less slow-wave sleep. According to\nProfessor Sahakian, a leading\nneuroscientist at Cambridge\nUniversity, studies have only\ninvestigated the effects of a\nsingle dose and so the long\nterm effects are unknown. It\nis also not known whether\nindividuals may develop a\ntolerance to Modafinil after\nrepeated use as with caffeine.\nIt has also been noted that in\napproximately 5 cases per\nmillion, the smart drug can\ncause Steven Johnson\u2019s syndrome where the individual\ndevelops a life-threatening\nrash. Furthermore, many\nstudents have reported that\nthey have become heavily\ndependent on Modafinil and\nit has become a habit to use\nit to pass their exams. On the\nother hand, some students\nhave reported that it does not\nhelp them study because their\nfocus shifts from their work to\nsmaller things. One university\nstudent, for example, stated\nthat he \u2018found [himself] focusing on more menial things like\nfootball matches rather than\nwork\u2019.\nFinally, although it is\nreported that Modafinil\nboosts focus and concentra-tion, the learning is superficial\nand the newly found knowledge is not processed into\nlong term memory. So\nalthough it is a quick fix\nfor an imminent exam, the\nknowledge cannot be applied\nand will not be retained in the\nlong term. Students should\ninstead find healthy study\ntechniques to prepare for\ntheir exams. During times of\nextreme stress, distractions\nlike exercise and meditation\ncan improve an individual\u2019s\nstate of mind.\nF\nact: The strongest\nliving thing on the\nplanet is gonorrhea.\nNeisseria gon-orrhoeae (the\nbacterium that\ncauses gonorrhea) is a force\nto be reckoned with, given\nit can pull with a force over\n100,000 times its own body\nweight. For a human to\ncompete, you\u2019d have to shift\nover ten million kilos, which\nweighs in at just over 50\nblue whales.\nThe secret to the incredible\nstrength of this bacterium\nis its wtiny tentacle-like\nstructures called pili, which\nare attached to a biological\nmotor not dissimilar from\nour own muscles. These\nallow the bacterium to crawl\nacross surfaces, but the huge\nforces they can exert might\nalso be a way in which the\nbug forces its way into our\ncells when infecting humans.\nAdmittedly, this powerhouse is a little on the\nsmall side, weighing in at\n0.000000000001 grams\n(one trillionth of a gram), so\nin real terms it can actually\nonly pull something about\n50 times lighter than a grain\nof sand. It could still beat\nyou in a fight though \u2013 some\nstrains of gonorrhea could\nkill you in a couple of days,\nand with their growing antibiotic resistance there might\nsoon be nothing your GP\ncan do for you.\nBro do you\neven lift?\nAnjeline Joegi looks at the pros and cons to taking the most widely used\nstudy drug\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\n\\\\ Newly formed\nknowledge is not\nprocessed into long\nterm memory \\\\\n\\\\ Hula Health & Nutrition\nThree most famous study drugs\n1.

So why is it so healthy\nfor us, even without the fish?\nLooking at it in the big\npicture, the Mediterranean\ndiet is full of fruits, vegetables,\nbeans, cereal grains like\nrice, and legumes, as well\nas copious amounts of olive\noil. Dairy, fish and wine\n(of course) are consumed\nin moderate amounts, with\nlimited intake of red meat\nand poultry. Researchers in\nthis study gathered data on\neating habits from almost a\nthousand Scottish people, all\naged around 70, who did not\nhave dementia. Participants\nall differed in how closely\ntheir dietary habits followed\nthat of a Mediterranean\nlifestyle. MRI scans showed\nthat those who followed\nthe diet more closely over\na period of three years\nwere less likely to lose brain\nvolume than those who didn\u2019t.\nIn fact, dietary difference\nalone explained 0.5%\ndifference in brain volume.\nThis doesn\u2019t sound like much,\nbut is a significant proportion\nwhen taking into account that\nthe total brain volume lost is\nsolely due to to the process of\nageing. And how do we know\nthat this difference really is\ncompletely attributed only to\ndiet?\nResearchers went a step\nfurther by testing other\npossible confounding factors\nsuch as age, gender, weight,\neducation, high blood\npressure, or having a history\nof diabetes or obesity. Results\nnevertheless remained the\nsame. The main, unusual\nFish from the Med, good for the head?\nLara Bailey looks at the useful applications of marijuana\nE\nveryone is\nfamiliar with the\nperceived positive\nand negative\nconnotations of\nMarijuana. In 2016\nalone, 51% of Americans\nsmoked cannabis, and its\nglobal use is on the rise\ndue to recent legalisation in\nseveral US states. However,\ndespite its widespread use,\nsurprisingly little has been\nconfirmed in terms of its\neffects on the human body.\nSo far, its legal status has\nhindered rigorous scientific\ntesting of cannabis, and studies performed so far have left\nmore questions than answers.\nIt is thought it could have\nsignificant medical potential.\nUnfortunately, any potential\nmedical benefits are yet to\nreach the public sphere.\nA new study published by\nthe National Academies of\nSciences, Engineering and\nMedicine in Washington D.C.,\nhas collated all available\nnegative and positive impacts\nof the drug. However, the\nmain point of the study is that\nthe legal status of cannabis\nneeds to be changed, so\nthat researchers can access\nit easily. If it is going to be\ntreated as a medical drug,\nthen it should be tested as\none. Without more testing,\nclaims of cannabis being a\n\u2018miracle cure\u2019 are relatively\nunfounded.\nFrom over 10,000 studies,\nseveral negative and positive\neffects of the drug were\nfound. Use of weed can lead\nto other drug addictions,\nalcohol abuse, and increased\nchance of developing psychological problems such as\nschizophrenia. Such issues\ncan arise with long-term and\nregular use of the drug. There\nis very low support in terms\nof its effectiveness as a treatment for epilepsy, and cancer,\ndespite claims. Encouragingly, researchers confirmed\nthat it does not increase\nthe risk of lung, head and\nneck cancers. However, the\ninfluence of the drug on heart\nissues and other cancers has\nnot been researched.\nPositive effects include\nreduction of chronic pain,\nand multiple sclerosis patients\nhave reported increased\nmuscle spasms on taking\nthe drug. The smoke may\ndeter inflammation-related\ninfection, but data on immune\nresponses is lacking. Few\nor no findings support its\neffectiveness in treating PTSD\nor Tourettes syndrome. This\nis not to say that cannabis is\nconclusively bad. While in\nsome cases the negative links\nare clear, long-term studies\nare needed to test other\nhealth impacts. For example,\nthe impact of cannabis on\nmemory and attention span is\nknown, but there is little data\nto support that use influences\nunemployment or school\ndrop-out rate. Moreover, the\nclear health benefits, such\n\\\\ A new study has\ncollated all negative\nand positive impacts\nof the drug \\\\\nPot and its potential\nas reduced nausea in cancer\npatients, highlight the need to\ntest it further.\nIt is clear that marijuana\nhas great potential. Currently in the UK, medical\nuse of cannabis in the form\nof Sativex, containing two\nchemicals from cannabis, can\nbe prescribed to MS patients.\nCannabis itself for medical\nuse is still illegal, and anyone\nusing it for medical reasons\ncan still be charged for pos-session. Several MPs have\ncalled for its legal status to be\nreassessed.\ntakeaway was that fish or\nmeat consumption did not\nmake a significant difference\nto brain health. It is important\nto note, following the study,\nthat results could be attributed\nto specific components of\nthe Mediterranean diet.\nPerhaps it was just the regular\nconsumption of butter beans\nor two kilos of kale per week\nthat did the trick.\nStudy author Michelle\nLuciano, PhD, of the University\nof Edinburgh says, \u201cAs we\nage, the brain shrinks and\nwe lose brain cells which can\naffect learning and memory.\nThis study adds to the body\nof evidence that suggests\nthe Mediterranean diet has\na positive impact on brain\nhealth.\u201d\n\n"

Well I\nhave had those times before and\nit is not easy to pick yourself up\nand continue. Just last Monday, my\nchef stupidly served my Kobe beef\nsteak medium rare when he knows\nI like it bloodier than a Sunday\nin Derry \u2013 Mondays right?! Well\nof course we all need strategies\nto perk our moods up and you\nshould look no further than my\nhome-brewed remedies that are\nguaranteed to instantly return you\nback to full form.\nFirst of all I recommend that\nyou decide to support a political\ncause that will inevitably achieve a\ndegree of success in the new year.\nAs you will already be aware, the\nleft is composed of known homosexuals and colluding communists\n(often the same thing) and as a\nresult, they will not be having any\nsuccess in the new year (thank\nGod). One up and coming party\nI can see having a lot of success\nin the near future is the National\nSocialist German Worker\u2019s Party,\nand I believe there is a lot that can\nbe incorporated from these bright\nupstarts into the New Republican\nParty \u2013 perhaps putting some sort\nof bright visible icons on minorities\nthat we don\u2019t trust. The main thing\nthat is keeping me going through\nthis week of disappointments\nsuch as Chelsea Manning getting\nreleased (she or he \u2013 make a\ndecision please) is the idea of the\ninauguration party I am hosting at\nthe end of this week. I\u2019ve made a\nwhole assortment of themed foods\nand I even managed to get a Bruce\nSpringsteen cover band to play at\nit, due to a last minute cancella-tion. I will be serving journalists\non a stick, grab \u2018em by the pussy\npies, and she doesn\u2019t have enough\nstamina smoked salmon.\nIt is also worth reflecting (I think\nthat\u2019s a queer word originally) on\nthe fact that other people around\nthe world have it far worse than\nyou. Whenever I stop to consider\nthis fact, it instantly puts a spring\nin my step \u2013 think about how there\nare women who won\u2019t be able to\nget abortions in certain states due\nto a lack of funding for Planned\nParenthood \u2013 hilarious! There\nare still ethnic minorities who are\nafraid to approach the police due\nto relentless violence \u2013 lol not me!\nWhite is right! Syria is still under\nsiege and the entirety of the West\nno longer cares about whether or\nnot they receive help \u2013 less terrorists over here! Just remember that if\nit ever seems as though things are\nreally bad, It\u2019s probably because\nyou used to touch yourself.\nT\nhe sexist election of\nDonald Trump. The\nBrexit decision of the UK\nto leave the European\nUnion. The fact that\nthere is a minuscule\namount of animal fat in the new\nfive pound notes. All of these\nevents brought the earth closer to\nits eventual apocalypse and it is\nprecisely in times like this where\nwe need to acknowledge the fact\nthat better times are just around the\ncorner.\nMy first thing is to surround\nmyself with comical pictures of\ncats, of course making sure that\nthe cats are of consensual age, as\nI have gotten into trouble before\nwith various members of PETA for\nthe possession of a few indecent\nphotos of kittens.

Now I\u2019m\njust thinking of those stupid sexy\ncats. God.\nIn order to distract myself from\nthe eventual implosion of the western political system, I have found\nthis amazing way of changing\npolitics. It\u2019s not getting involved in\npolitics and trying to change things\nfor the better as, of course, that\nwould be too much effort. Instead I\nhave found a way where lefty-poli-tics actually works and manages to\nprovide a stable economy \u2013 I have\nstarted to take magic mushrooms.\nIn this magical world, climate\nchange is actually recognised as a\npotential problem, all old people\nare taken out and shot to prevent\nthem from slowing the advancement of progressive politics, and\nwe finally have a trans-leader in\nboth 10 Downing Street and the\nWhite House.\nWe can also look forward to the\nfact that soon we will all drown\nand die as a result of the polar\nice caps melting and causing the\nwhole of life on Earth to become\nsubmerged. Eventually after every\ngreedy human corpse and animal\nskeleton has decomposed, after a\nfew million years we will be ready\nto restart and make a greater\nplanet for everyone.

Do start wearing t-shirts\nwith homoerotic slogans such as \u201cI\u2019m\nnot gay but a tenner\u2019s a tenner\u201d.

Now I\u2019m not sure when I stuck my tongeu\ndown my mate John\u2019s throat, but I\u2019m sure that I liked it and now I\u2019m really confused\ncause I only watched gay porn once like as a joke and I had mixed feelings.\nAnyway I\u2019m homo now and my housemate just came in the kitchen and yelled at\nme cause I have been reading out loud everything I\u2019ve been writing and its\u2019s like\nvery late and she was sleeping I think.\nPls help.\nYours faithgullu\nJohn Smith (my real name I swear)\n\n"

The United\nArab Emirates has\nbanned the private\nownership and\ndealing of wild animals. Status\npets are on the way out and,\nhopefully, back into the wild.\nAnimal rights activists are\nunderstandably thrilled, for\nthis is a triumph.

The process\nof male chick culling may also be a horror\nof the past with the development of new\ntechnology capable of determining the\ngender of a chick before it hatches. It\nwould allow egg producers to remove\nmale and infertile eggs before they enter\nincubation, so they can be used for human\nconsumption rather than destroyed on\nhatching. But most significant of all the\nanimal success stories is that Ipswich has\nfinally got itself a Hedgehog Officer.\nWith joint funding from the Hedgehog\nPreservation Society, Suffolk Wildlife Trust\nand Heritage Lottery Fund the role will be\npart of an effort to combat the decline of\nthese wonderful creatures in the area.\nSuch positive progress justifies a moment\nof celebratory reflection. It appears the\ndependence we have on animals, and\nthe importance of treating them well, is\nstarting to sink in. Respecting our animal\ncounterparts as equals, empathising with\nthem, understanding that they are not so\ndifferent from us are all crucial lessons in\nthe move towards a better, less destructive\nco-existence.\nWhat\u2019s happening now for animals\nprovides a shred of optimism for the\nworld. Amongst all the doom and gloom\nof Trump\u2019s presidency and cold war\ndistrust re-emerging, at least those who\nhad suffered in silence for the longest are\nbeginning to be represented. We can be\nproud of this, even if it is just rectifying the\nproblems we caused ourselves.\nH\nave you been feeling\ndown this week?\nAllegedly there is\nan explanation for\nthis \u2013 some claim it is\nthe most depressing\nweek of the year. More specifically,\nthe Monday that just passed has\nbeen christened 'Blue Monday'\nas a result of post-holiday reality\nkicking in and everyone generally\nfeeling a bit shit. The third Monday\nof January was described as the\nmost depressing day of the year by\nCliff Arnell using an equation which\nsupposedly took into consideration\na multitude of variables such as\nweather, debt, monthly salary, time\nsince Christmas, time since failing\nour new year\u2019s resolutions and low\nmotivational levels.\nIt cannot be denied that January\ncan be a tough month emotionally,\nfinancially and psychologically\nbut many including Ben Goldarce,\nnotorious for unpicking the misuse of\nscience and statistics by journalists,\nhave called the equation and the\nwhole idea of Blue Monday, a\nfarce.\nI cannot help but agree. A little\nresearch into the matter shows\nthat Arnell\u2019s equation was derived\nto help airlines predict trends in\nbookings to improve marketing and\nin reality makes no mathematical\nsense. By telling us that we are\nmiserable, airlines can sell holidays\nas a pick me up or a cure. By all\naccounts this is clever marketing,\nexploiting the post Christmas lull\nto target January frugality; Blue\nMonday encourages us to buy\nholidays rather than pinching\npennies throughout January.\nAlthough the idea of Blue Monday\nmay not be a reality, January is\na tough month for many of us,\nespecially at Imperial. January\nexams, coursework deadlines and\nleaving home confort for student\ndigs gets the best of us down, but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that we are all\nsuddenly depressed.\nDepression is a mental illness\nthat should not be confused with\nsadness. Feeling sad or stressed in\nthe face of January\u2019s challenges is\nnot unusual or unhealthy, as long as\nwe continue to prioritise self-care\nand the good things in life. If you\nare feeling the January blues treat\nyourself to a hot bath, a good movie\nor some time with friends. Revision\nis important but taking breaks is\nbetter for your health and your\nlearning. And if you feel like you\u2019re\ntaking January in your stride, don\u2019t\ndoubt yourself or feel guilty \u2013 just\nbecause it is January doesn\u2019t mean\nyou have to feel sad.\nunhappiness. Now according\nto Gulf News \"Anyone who\ntakes a leopard, cheetah\nor any other kind of exotic\nanimal out in public will face\na jail term of up to six months\nand a fine\". Good stuff.\nHaving read this news after\ndetailing the potential fate of\nneglected exotic pets, I can\nhold a glimmer of hope for\nhuman attitudes towards our\nanimal friends. By the end of\n2017 China is set to ban all\nivory trade and processing\nactivities.

Reading the official\nSU statement, I am here to\nretract my previous article and\nto write an apology.\nAfter reading the article in\nthe Telegraph, I went on the\nSOAS Student's Union site to\nfind any news article about\nthis topic. A cursory glance\nat the front page, where I had\nexpected it to be highlighted,\ngave me no result, so I assumed that The Telegraph was\na respectable and accurate\nsource to use.\nInstead of the supposed aim\nto ban white philosophers,\nthe BA World Philosophies\nprogramme wants to simultaneously teach about hitherto\nlittle known thinkers: the great\nArabic minds like al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b,\nAvicenna and Averroes, the\nIndian thinkers N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Di\u0144naga, Uddyotak\u0101ra,\nGa\u0144ge\u015ba etc. and African philosophers like Kwami Anthony\nAppiah, Franz Fanon, Achille\nMbembe, Valentin-Yves Mudimbe, Enrique Dussell and\nWalter Mignolo. The teaching\nof European philosophy is to\nbe done by exploring the context of how they developed\nand how Enlightenment ideas\nof liberty, human rights and\nequality developed alongside\nthe contemporary colonisation and imperialism. There is\nno intention to ban European\nphilosophy, seeing how the\nintention of the course is to\nlearn how different intellectual\ntraditions interacted and de-veloped.\nSOAS students had voted to\nmake \u201cDecolonising the University\u201d the top priority of the\nStudent Union, with the focus\non reviewing the curriculum\nand developing Black and\nMinority Ethnic (BME) academic staff and students as\n\\\\ Reading the official SU\nstatement, I am here to\nretract my previous article\nand to write an apology \\\\\n\\\\ They are not\nsnowflakes and do\nnot epitomise hate,\nbigotry, ignorance\nand racism \\\\\na form of reparative justice.\nWhatever my personal views\non the wider movement of de-colonisation, as I believe that\nall actions in history should\nbe viewed in context with the\ncontemporary environment\nand not through a modern\nlens, this is the choice of the\nstudents involved and must be\naccepted.\nI apologise for my writing\nand the condemnation I had\nheaped on the SOAS Student\nUnion and retract the following\nlines.

They do not want\nto create racist, narrow-mind-ed, brainwashed, and hateful\nidiots, rather to develop themselves through a more critical\nunderstanding of philosophy.\nLastly, they are not intolerant.\nLastly in response to my\npoint about colonialism, I was\nnot making a moral or supportive case for it, but rather\nto state that instead of being\na zero-sum game, to see colonialism for its contemporary\ncontext and that it had led\nto good and bad outcomes,\nwhatever the morally dubious\nbasis it stems from. Though it\u2019s\ncoloured by my own personal\nbenefit from British colonialism in Malaysia and the subsequent development of the\nnation after independence, I\nsought to challenge the prevailing narrative surrounding\ncolonialism.\nThis has been an interesting\ntopic to cover and I welcome\nfuture opportunities for learn-ing.\n\\\\ I apologise for\nmy writing and the\ncondemnation I had\nheaped on the SOAS\nStudent Union and\nretract the following\nlines \\\\\n\\\\ They do not hate\nwhite people, white\nknowledge or white\ncivilisation \\\\\n\\\\ Lastly, they are not\nintolerant \\\\\n\\\\ They do not want\nto create racist,\nnarrow-minded,\nbrainwashed,\nand hateful idiots,\nrather to develop\nthemselves through\na more critical\nunderstanding of\nphilosophy \\\\\n\n"

If you actually listen\nto that advice, it would be an\nunfortunate event in of itself,\nas you would be missing out\non a well-made, dark and\nincredibly self-aware series.\nA series of unfortunate\nevents were originally a much\nbeloved book series, telling\nthe story of the Baudelaire\norphans, Violet, Klaus and\nSunny. Right off the bat, their\nparents die in a mysterious\nhouse fire and they are thrust\ninto a grim and dark world,\nconstantly shifting between\nguardians and being pursued\nby the menacing Count Olaf,\nwho\u2019s after their inheritance\nand plans all sorts of vile\nschemes to get his way.\nWhile a previous film\nadaptation with Jim Carey\nwas a bit more free with the\nsource material, this Netflix\nseries adapts the books very\nclosely. Of course it helps\nmassively that the real-life\nwriter, Daniel Handler, is\nan executive producer and\nthe show\u2019s writer. Roughly,\neach book is divided into two\nepisodes, and watching two,\nor even one is enough to tell\na cohesive story for those\nnot fans of binge watching.\nWatching several together,\nhowever, may feel a bit cyclic\nat times.\nThe highlight of the show\nis Neil Patrick Harris as the\nzany and despicable Count\nOlaf, who is always just about\nsmarter than all the other\nadults so that he can conduct\nhis meticulous plans. Harris is\nable to nail the ridiculousness\nof the character, while making\nsure he remains a frightening\nforce to be reckoned with.\nThe actors who play the older\nBaudelaires, Weissman and\nHynes, are also terrific and\ninstantly likeable, able to\nhold their own against their\nexperienced adult co-stars.\nThis is both literal and figurative as the series portrays\nthe children as intelligent and\nobservant, as opposed to\nthe adults who are depicted\nas dumb and corrupted by\nsociety.\nPatrick Warburton is also a\nreal treat as Lemony Snicket.\nHe opens and closes the\nepisodes as well as interjects\nbetween various key scenes,\ngiving us a fourth wall com-mentary, explaining certain\nphrases or apologizing for\nthe dark nature of this tale.\nHis costumes and deliberately\ndry delivery are amusing to\nwatch and add levity to the\nproceedings while alloing for\nfun visual transitions between\nscenes.\nThe show never shies away\nfrom its dark and dreary\nnature; it\u2019s about a man maliciously after three orphans\nafter all. Count Olaf\u2019s actions\nalways feel tense and creepy,\nwhether it\u2019s his plan to marry\na fourteen year old girl or\neven his simple action of slapping a child. As weird and\nexpansive as it is, this series\nis similar tonally to shows\nlike Jessica Jones or Stranger\nThings, while being crazier\nand wackier.\nThis show also really flourishes on world-building and\nthe style really makes each\nepisode feel unique (almost\nlike they were based on\nbooks). With a mix of practical design, CGI and beautiful\nset castings, every\nnew location\nfeels unique\nand well\n\\\\ The highlight of\nthe show is Neil\nPatrick Harris as the\nzany and dispicable\nCount Olaf \\\\\nBarney did not age well \\\\ Netflix\ndesigned, from the messy\nand decaying rooms of Count\nOlaf\u2019s mansion and the\nvibrant and lively environment that is the Reptile Room.\nThough at times the CGI may\nfalter, in some of Sunny\u2019s\nscenes for instance, there\u2019s\nalways a stunning view with\nan appropriate atmosphere.\nThere\u2019s also a fun mix of\nthe contemporary and the\nvintage with archaic clothing\nstyles and steampunk devices\nThe narrator can make or break the story \\\\ Netflix\namidst references like Uber\nand Haruki Murakami.\nIt honestly does not matter if\nyou\u2019ve never read any of the\nbooks filled with Unfortunate\nEvents. This Netflix series is\nextremely welcoming to new-comers, opening its mystery\nbox of encapsulating despair\nfrom the first episode and\nlayering it with performances,\nwriting and direction that\nkeep you riveted until the\nend. An ongoing mystery\nkeeps you coming back for\nmore; even if you are a book\nreader, there\u2019s something new\nas an intriguing new subplot\nis added not seen in the\nbooks.\nAt this point, any Netflix\nadaptation is bound to be\ngood and this show is no\nexception. While the plot\nmay get a bit repetitive, the\ncharming cast and lingering\nmysteries are consistently\nengaging and just plain fun,\nfor lack of a better word.\nThough Lemony Snicket may\nconstantly protest, you\u2019d be\ndoing yourself a disservice if\nyou don\u2019t watch this show.\nother people \u2013 would complete you as a human being\u201d\nexchange between Sherlock\nand John in The Lying Detective? Surely not with Molly\n- the \u201cI love you\u201d that was so\nwidely publicised before the\nseries aired turned out to be\npart of a horrifically misogynistic and manipulative scene,\nthe emotional fallout from\nwhich was never explored.\nThe Final Problem revelled in\nits hollowness, watching it felt\nlike being trapped inside a\ncardboard bunker - as indeed\nSherlock was in the last\nscenes of the episode - the\nwalls of the world The Final\nProblem created collapsed\nat the slightest scrutiny. \u201cNo\nloose ends, not on my watch\u201d\nproclaimed Mark Gatiss as\nMycroft Holmes in the second\nepisode of this series \u2013 one\ncould\u2019ve drowned in the\nloose ends in the episode that\nfollowed.\nIf this is indeed the last\nepisode of Sherlock, how\nwill the series be judged\nas a whole?

Benedict Cumberbatch delivered\na masterful performance\nof a man devastated by\nthe marriage of the man he\nloves to someone else in The\nSign of Three. The seeds of\nthe idea that the Sherlock\nand John relationship could\ndevelop into a romantic one\nwere steadily planted never\nto fully flourish. Subtextually\nthe show referred heavily to\nThe Private Life of Sherlock\nHolmes, a film that both\nGatiss and Moffat rate as one\nof their favourite adaptations\nof the original stories \u2013 Gatiss\ngoing so far as to say to The\nGuardian that the screenplay\nformed a template for BBC\u2019s\nSherlock. In Private Life,\nSherlock Holmes is depicted\nas a closeted gay man des-perately, silently in love with\nJohn Watson, medicating with\ncocaine to hide his pain and\nguilt. Years after the film\u2019s\nrelease, director Billy Wilder\nspoke of his great regret of\nnever making the relationship\nexplicit \u201cI wanted to make\nHolmes a homosexual . . .\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s on dope, you\nknow.\u201d\nWilder is a character that\nappears in The Abominable Bride: the skull in 221B,\nSherlock\u2019s junkie friend,\neven Sherlock himself\n(\u201cWilliam Sherlock Scott\nHolmes- if you\u2019re looking\nfor baby names\u201d) are all\nnamed \u201cBilly\u201d, and numerous\nlines from \u201cis tea code?\u201d to\n\u201cadmirably high arches\u201d, to\nthe flower in John\u2019s hair are\nPrivate Life references. Yet all\nthis queer coding \u2013 nudges\nat Oscar Wilde, at Private\nLife, all those aborted almost\nconfessions \u2013 at the tarmac,\nat the end of The Lying\nDetective come to nothing,\nor are treated as a joke. The\nvillains on the other hand\n\u2013 from Moriarty, to Irene\nAdler to Euros are explicitly\nstated to be queer. Their\nqueerness is often associated with violence or sexual\nabuse (Moriarty and Euros)\nor disregarded altogether in\nservice of plot (Irene). Such\nblatant homophobia is always\nunacceptable but especially\ngalling from Mark Gatiss,\nhimself a gay man.\nIn an interview with Gay\nTimes in 2011 Gatiss spoke\nof his dream of intelligently\nportrayed queer representation on TV; \u201cThat\u2019s how the\nrevolution happens... I think\nwhen the day comes that you\nhave a big detective show\u2026\n[in which the detective goes\nto work and] he\u2019s a maverick\nand all the usual things and\n[when he gets home] and\nhis boyfriend says, \u201cAre you\nalright?\u201d... then something\nwould have genuinely\nchanged.\u201d On Sherlock,\nGatiss was given the chance\nto stage that revolution and\nit would seem he had neither\nthe courage nor the ingenuity\nto seize it.\nMoffat has long been\naccused of misogynistic\nwriting and the accusations\nfollow him to Sherlock. Mary,\nthe unseen housewife who\ndies off screen in the Conan\nDoyle stories was transformed\ninto a character with agency\nin the BBC show only to die\non screen and be periodically resurrected to help her\n\u201cBaker Street boys\u201d along.\nIt was a textbook case of\n\u2018fridging\u2019 a female character\n\u2013 an allusion heightened by\nMycroft opening an empty\nfridge in the moments after\nMary\u2019s death. Molly, a\nGatiss and Moffat original\ncharacter grew to develop\nbeyond her infatuation with\nSherlock through the series\nonly to be forced back into\nthat box in the final episode.\nThese instances only add to\nthe already long list of crimes\nthis show has perpetrated\nagainst its female characters\nthroughout its run.\nReal world implications\naside, in a purely narrative\nsense The Final Problem\nand Series 4 as a whole\nset about systematically\ndismantling what the previous\nthree seasons built up. In\nan interview with\nIGN in 2014 Steven Moffat\nsaid of the show: \u201c it\u2019s not a\ndetective show. It\u2019s a show\nabout a detective. That\u2019s why\nit\u2019s exciting.\u201d Yet in a voice\nover at the end of The Final\nProblem Mary declares \u201cit\nnot about who you really are,\nit\u2019s all about the legends.\u201d\nThe show sacrificed character\ngrowth at the altar of high\noctane action and as a result\nfell utterly flat, becoming a\nparody of itself and its genre.\nIndeed the final episode\u2019s\nincongruity with the show as\na whole has led some fans to\nspeculate on the existence of\na secret fourth episode that\nis yet to air \u2013 and who can\nblame them, from the first\nmoment of The Final Problem\nto its last it feels like Moriarty\nhas hacked into every screen\nshowing Sherlock.\nIf this final episode really\nis the end of series 4 (and\nat this point it\u2019s far from\ncertainty in my mind) then it\nwas the protracted death of\na once great show. The show\nrunners doubt whether they\nwill be able to make series 5;\nif this is was the culmination\nof their great plan, they don\u2019t\ndeserve to. The Final Problem\ngot a standing ovation at the\npress screening. Why, we\nmust ask ourselves. Perhaps,\nas one incisive friend put it,\nit was because it was finally,\nthankfully, over.\n\\\\It was a textbook\ncase of \u2018fridging\u2019 a\nfemale character\n- an allusion\nheightened by\nMycroft opening an\nempty fridge \\\\\nKeeping the queer-baiting really subtle, Gatiss \\\\ BBC\nWhat was it Nietzsche said about staring into the Abyss? \\\\ BBC\n\n"

Probably.\nAccording to a teasing\nannouncement from Library\nServices just before Christmas,\n\u201cearly indications are that a\nproject to improve the temperature at Central Library will\nbegin in 2017.\u201d\nThis comes after felix\nlaunched a campaign last\nsummer demanding humane\nstudying conditions in the\nCentral Library, notorious for\nreaching face-melting tem-peratures, particularly during\nsummer term. According to\nLibrary Services, temperature regulation has been \u201cthe\nsingle biggest source of complaint from the student body\nfor several years\u201d.\nThis development is meant\nto be the second phase of a\nlarger project which began in\n2014 and will most likely be\ntaking place over this academic\nyear\u2019s summer vacation period\nhopefully to be completed by\nautumn 2017. Phase one saw\nthe Central Library improve on\nissues with overcrowding and\nlimited computer availability;\nthe Science Museum Library\nwas evicted from the third floor\nand the space was turned into\na study area.\nPhase two was meant to deal\nwith temperature regulation\nand indeed there was a successful application for Planning\nPermission back in 2014, of a\nventilation plant that would\nsit on the roof of Sherfield.\nThe plant, occupying a space\nof 68 cubic meters, would be\nconnected to the library by\ninternally built ductwork.\nUnfortunately the works,\nreportedly projected to cost\nan estimated \u00a313.5m, had\nbeen put on ice, as only half\nthe funding necessary had\nbeen secured. It appears\nthough that the felix petition,\nwhich gathered 13,000 signatures (just under 10% of\nthe student body), along with\npressure from the Union and\nsome NSS-induced panic\nhave convinced College to\ngo through with the plans.\nDespite the hype, it has been\nstressed to us that nothing is\nset in stone and there are still\nmany sign-offs the proposed\nproject needs to pass before\npromises are made and plans\nare finalised. This is perhaps\nwhy all announcements so far\nhave been rather non-com-mittal and Library Services,\nunable to contain their excite-ment, went rogue and spilled\nthe beans.\nHowever, the Library service\nrecently made public a preliminary timetable of the works,\nbringing dreams of a well ventilated library one step closer\nto realisation.\nAccording to the timetable\n(which remains subject to\napproval from College) some\npreliminary works will be\ntaking place during the end of\nthis month/beginning of next\nmonth, including the erection\nof scaffolding and the relocation of some of the library\u2019s\nbooks and seating.\nSome noisy work will also be\ntaking place throughout spring\nterm but it will be restricted\nbetween 6:00 and 9:00am.\nNo details have been\nreleased yet regarding plans\nfor the summer term, however\nit is expected that the bulk of\nthe works will be taking place\nduring this academic year\u2019s\nsummer break.\nThough generally the student\ncommunity is excited for the\nprospect of study areas that\ndon\u2019t send them into thermal\nshock, some students remain\ndoubtful. \u201cYeah I wouldn\u2019t be\ntoo optimistic\u201d, says one stu-dent. \u201cI swear a rumor about\nlibrary air-con gets spread at\nleast once a year and has been\nfor as long as I can remember.\u201d\nIndeed, climate control has\nplagued the Central Library for\nover a decade. The last major\noverhaul started in 2007 and\ncost over \u00a310m. Issues with\ncooling of the higher levels\nhad from the beginning of\nthe project become apparent,\nwith the top two floors hitting\n30 degrees Celsius. Efforts\nto provide solar shading\nwere blocked by Westminster\nCity Council due to aesthetic\nreasons (considering the aesthetics of the rest of South\nKen Campus, one can only\nwonder) and the Chiller and\nService Tower constructed on\nthe roof of Sherfield and which\ncost over \u00a36m failed to hit the\nspot quite the way it was meant\nto.

Although the\ncriticism \u2013 which resurfaced\nafter Imperial published its\ninstitutional culture report\n\u2013 is unrelated to Danskine\u2019s\ndirection of Sport Imperial,\nit did manage to receive\nnational coverage once more.\nThe incident refers to the\nsexist mistreatment of the\nWomen\u2019s Rugby during the\n2015 Varsity. Sport Imperial\nfailed to provide adequate\ntransport and changing\nfacilities to the women\u2019s\nrubgy teams despite the fact\nthey were headlining. The\nplayers were also left without\nfood, stranded without\ntransportation and called \u201cfat\ngirls\u201d by management.\nEarlier this academic year,\nSport Imperial also came\nunder fire for running a\nsexist \u2018Imperial Girls Can\u2019\ncampaign. The campaign was\nmeant to encourage sport\nparticipation amongst women\ncalling on them to \u201cbounce the\ncalories away\u201d.\nDanskine\u2019s resignation\ncame as a surprise to many\nUnion staff members and\nstudents even though a\nCollege spokesperson said it\nwas submitted in December.\nFor quite some time, the\nSport Imperial website listed\nDanskine as \u201cActing Head of\nSport Imperial\u201d, with some\nsources telling felix he was on\nindefinite leave. It was only on\nWednesday that the position\nwas officially shown to be\n\u201cvacant\u201d online.\nA College spokesperson\ntold felix that \u201cImperial is\ncurrently recruiting for a new\nHead of Sport, following the\nresignation of the previous\npostholder in December.

Amnesty\nInternational has reported\nshe suffered an unfair\ntrial, and was subjected to\nsolitary confinement with no\naccess to a lawyer or her\nfamily, and forced to make a\nconfession. Her incarceration\nwas appealed earlier this\nmonth, a decision is still to\nbe heard. Accusations were\npublished in Iranian media\nthat she is the ringleader of\na spy network for foreign\ngovernments attempting the\n\u201csoft overthrow\u201d of the Iranian\nrepublic.

(Though earlier last\nyear the first e-sports varsity\nwas launched at Gfinity Arena\nbetween King\u2019s , LSE, UCL\nyours truly)\nThe City Varsity is almost\nexclusively student led, with\nsome input from the Union,\nand at least for now will only\nbe featuring matches from\nImperial\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nrugby. This means there won\u2019t\nbe any medics playing. When\nasked if there were plans to\ninvolve medics in the external\nvarsity, club captain of men\u2019s\nrugby and chief organiser of\nthe initiative, Josh O\u2019Donnell\ntold felix that it could happen\nbut the process would involve\nholding trials and bringing\nmedic players in just for the\nguest match.\nRegardless, the launch of\nthe City Varsity has been met\nwith excitement. According to\nrivalry with the medics on\nthe back burner, Imperial\u2019s\ninternal Varsity with the\nSchool of Medicine will not\nbe scrapped. Games will\ncontinue to take place as they\nhave for the last 15 years and\nthis year\u2019s VarsityFest will go\nahead as planned.\nWhether the City Varsity\nwill become a tradition will\ndepend on turnout, but\norganisers are optimistic. As\nACC chair Ellie Winstanley\nputs it, the games are \u201ctesting\nthe waters because the people\nwant the water to be tested\u201d.\nHopefully turnout will be\nhigh unlike the 2011 intercollegiate Summer Ball\nwhich suffered a loss of\n\u00a3100,000.\nAnd if it is, there are\nplans for expansion, with\nexpressed involvement\nof football, hockey and\nnetball but also other\nsports club that don\u2019t\ntraditionally participate in\nVarsity due to the lack of\nmedic counterparts, such\nas Fencing and Shooting.\nO\u2019Donnell, the rivalry with the\nmedics has simmered down\nover the years and there\u2019s\nbeen a great appetite to find\na new rivalry through an\nexternal varsity.\nWhether LSE will prove\na worthy rival remains to\nbe seen. \u201cThere\u2019s no bad\nblood yet, but we\u2019re working\non it\u201d said Women\u2019s rugby\ncaptain, Charlotte Gisbourne.\nWomen\u2019s rugby will be kicking\noff the event, followed by the\nmen\u2019s games.\nAlthough it may seem like\nthis event is putting Imperial\u2019s\n\n"

Gatiss\nand Moffat\u2019s Sherlock in its\nseven year run was known\nfor honouring this tradition\neven as the writers adapted\nand re-formed the original\nstories for the episodes. The\nFinal Problem however chose\nto dive head first into the\nworld of the impossible in a\nmove that made watching\nthe episode feel like being\nsuspended in a constant state\nof anticipation \u2013 waiting for\nthe other shoe to drop \u2013 waiting for Sherlock to wake up,\nwaiting for everything to be\nexplained.\nFrom the first moments we\nare plunged into a world\npopulated with killer clowns,\nportraits that cry blood, men\nwho can jump from burning\nsecond storey flats onto busy\nLondon streets and walk\naway unharmed, we are\nasked to believe that a secret\nomnipotent Holmes sister lives\nin an Azkaban-like prison\nfortress plotting revenge for\nthe time her infant brother\ndidn\u2019t play with her (despite\nher mind control abilities).\nWe are asked to believe in\na detective who walks into a\nbrightly lit room and cannot\ndistinguish glass from empty\nair, we are asked to believe\nthat Mary Watson, before\nher entirely unplanned death,\nrecorded several DVD messages and arranged for them\nto be delivered to her husband and to his best friend\nto aid them in their emotional\njourney from the grave. We\nwere asked to believe a child\nturned the memory of his\nmurdered best friend into the\nmemory of a dog. We were,\nin short, asked to believe\ntoo much, suspend our disbelief for too long. Sherlock\nwas once a show built on\ningenuity \u2013 plot twists that\nwere surprising but could be\npredicted if one looked hard\nat the clues, it was a show\nthat invited the audience to\ndeduce it, yet here, in its last\nhurrah, it gave up intelligent dramatization and\ncharacter development for\na remake\nof\n\\\\ What exactly did\nMoffat and co-cre-ator Gatiss think\nshould be done? \\\\\nThe hair\u2019s looking better this season,\nat least \\\\ BBC\nSaw.\nThe problems with The\nFinal Problem are the ones\nthat have steadily accumulated throughout Series 4\nwhich progressively became\ndetached from any semblance of reality.

This dichotomy\nseems strange, but the crux\nis that these two parts of the\ngame depend on each other.\nAs the Persona is based on\nthe main character\u2019s psyche,\nthen by forging bonds and\nrelations with other people\nyou increase the potential of\nyour Persona and can unlock\nT\nhere are very few\ngames which I have\nabsolute faith in.\nI was incredibly\nsceptical about both\nFinal Fantasy XV\nand also The Last Guardian,\nwhich was my personal\nGame of the Year 2016; in\nfact, I was almost convinced\nat least one of them would\nbe a massive train wreck.\nEven games like Nioh and\nNier: Automata, both of\nwhich seem like they will be\ngreat, may not live up to\nexpectations. However, I am\nconvinced, beyond a shadow\nof a doubt, that Persona 5 will\nbe absolutely phenomenal.\nPersona 5 is a turn-based\nrole-playing game developed\nHowever, he soon awakens a\npower: his titular Persona, a\nsupernatural being brought\nto life as a manifestation of\nhis personality and psyche.\nHe and his friends all find\nthemselves with Personas, and\nthey form a vigilante group\ncalled the \u201cPhantom Thieves\u201d\nwhich they use to bring justice\nto those who deserve it.\nThe Persona series has an\ninteresting history, as they\nare in fact spin-off games of\na larger franchise. This fran-chise, Shin Megami Tensei, is\nextremely popular in Japan;\nthe first instalment in the\nseries was released in 1987\non the NES, and the series\nhas only grown since then.\nThe mainline games consist of\nMegami Tensei titles, and they\nspawned numerous spin-offs,\nincluding Devil Summoner,\nDigital Devil Saga, Devil Survivor and of course Persona,\nthe largest and most successful spin-off of the franchise,\nwhich itself has spawned\nspin-off titles. There is little, if\nany, continuity between the\ngames, though they do share\ncertain elements such as\ngameplay mechanics, themes\nand settings.\nInterestingly, Persona 5 is\nactually the sixth mainline\nentry in the Persona franchise.\nThe first few games have not\naged gracefully as Persona 3\nwas where the series really hit\nits stride and changed up its\nformula for the better, which\ncontinued over to Persona 4\nand Persona 5. The games\nare an incredibly strange mix;\nduring the day, you play as\na schoolboy going about his\ndaily life, going to school,\ninteracting with his class-mates, joining clubs and so\non; but at night it becomes a\nnew Personas. Every activity\nyou do, be it interacting with\nfriends, playing sports or\neven doing well in an exam,\nincreases your stats and aids\nin the battles you will face\nlater on.\nDespite Persona 3, 4 and\n5 sharing so many qualities,\nAtlus manages to make all\nthree games feel incredibly\ndifferent. All three games\nhave their own distinctive\ncolour; blue in Persona 3,\nyellow in 4 and red in 5.\nThese colours set the mood\nand main theme of the entire\ngame; Persona 3 is extremely\ndark and moody, as its main\ntheme is death and rebirth;\nPersona 4 on the other hand\nis joyful and its main theme is\nacceptance. Persona 5 seems\nto be full of anger; its main\ntheme is being freed from the\nshackles of society, and this\nis the driving force behind its\nmain character.\nPersona 5 is also oozing\nwith style; every animation,\nmenu and speech bubble\nhas flair and a single unique\naesthetic that looks absolutely\ngorgeous. The are no walls\nof text; everything pops\nand even the most mundane\nthings, like the battle results\nscreen, suddenly becomes\nvery exciting. The gameplay remains solid with a\ntraditional turn-based combat\nsystem; enemies can be\nknocked down by exploiting\ntheir weaknesses, and if all\nGame spotlight | Persona 5\nenemies are knocked down,\ncharacters become able to\nperform \u2018All-Out Attacks\u2019,\nthough now you can also\nconvince other enemies to\njoin you as a Persona.\nPersona 5 is a huge leap\nforward for the series, especially given that the previous\ninstalment was on the PS2.\nDespite the long wait and\nsubsequent delay, it is finally\nlaunching in the west on the\n4th\nof April 2017. The Japanese reviews are extremely\npositive, and I cannot wait for\nits release worldwide.\n\\\\ Its main theme\nis being freed from\nthe shackles of\nsociety \\\\\nby Atlus and set in modern\nday Tokyo. The main character is transferred to a new\nschool after being accused\nfor assaulting a stalker.\nStudents by day, vigilantes by night \\\\ Atlus\n\n"

Did you know?\nI certainly didn\u2019t, but it was\nplayed between two giants\nof the game to decide who\nwould progress for a chance\nat the Super Bowl. No, not\na huge piece of crockery for\nmammoth breakfast portions,\nbut the most important date\nin the American football\ncalendar. In pure American\nstyle the Super Bowl is an\nevent of epic proportions,\nwith the likes of the Red Hot\nChilli Peppers, Beyonc\u00e9, The\nWho and Bruce Springsteen\ngracing the famous half-time\nextravaganzas. Before I even\nget into my attempt at taking\nthis on, I\u2019m already excited\nby a sport whose associated\nentertainment dwarfs the\nMonmouth Male Voice Choir\nwho sang at the Six Nations\nlast year (still brilliant I hasten\nto add).\nI\u2019ve played a number of\nsports in my time, but I\u2019ve\nnever really taken to the great\nAmerican pastimes. Of course\nI played Rounders at school\n(close enough to Baseball)\nand being tall meant I could\nstand in front of a Basketball\nhoop with my arms held up\nwith reasonable success, but\nhaving Welsh in-laws gives\nme loyalty to Rugby. Watching American Football always\nseemed so slow and simple:\nshort plays culminating in\n\u201cgo-fetch\u201d, constant breaks\nand dramatized field goals.\nBut I think it\u2019s fair to say, and\nyou can quote me on this, I\nwas wrong.\nSunday morning and I\u2019m\nstood outside the Union\nholding borrowed shoulder\npads and a helmet alongside\nour resident pig-skin team,\nthe Imperial Immortals. The\nkit, provided for all members,\nmakes me look far bigger\nand stronger than I am, but\nI\u2019ll accept this as a momentary butch-boost. Under the\nstoic gaze of Prince Albert,\ntraining starts with some basic\nstretches. The camaraderie\nand encouragement are\nevident from the start, everyone high-fiving after each\nexercise. No boundaries exist\nbetween hardened members\nand amateurs, everyone was\nwelcome and everyone was\nincluded. I\u2019m introduced to\nthe coach who is more than\nhappy to integrate me in to\nthe main training session even\nthough I know next to nothing\nabout what\u2019s going on. If\nI need to take a balanced\nview for fairness, I did not\nenjoying the running and was\nslightly left behind but that is\nexercises specific to their\nrole. The coaches are clearly\nexperienced and dedicated\nto improving the team\u2019s\nperformance, having drafted\nnew tactics over the holidays.\nConstant repetition of drills\nensure each player understands their job to the letter.\nI\u2019ve been grouped with the\ncode (not the official name,\nI\u2019ve coined this particular\nterm) is made up of numbers\nand words which indicate to\neach member of the team the\nstrategy for this particular\nplay. Where they need to\nrun, who is tackling who and\nwhat part of the body they\nneed to scratch next. OK, that\nlast one is slightly exaggerated but trust me, it could\neasily be integrated and the\nopposition would be suitably\nconfused. You\u2019ll have heard it\nbefore on any film featuring\nAmerican Football but there\nis no agreed format. Each\nteam has their own language\nand by the end of the session,\nyour mother tongue will be\nless fluent in comparison. But\nto work as a team. In that\nstiffling helmet you cannot\nalways see the entire picture,\ninstead relying on everyone\nknowing their role perfectly.\nOnto the plays. I\u2019m asked\nto stand in as a blocker whilst\nthe rest of the team practice\ntheir movements. This resulted\nin the coach giving me the\nbest life advice I\u2019ve ever\nreceived: \u201cCrouch down,\nhead up and when signalled\nmove forward with a small\nwaddle\u201d. And I did. Brilliantly.\nI\u2019m being serious. Not a\nsingle opponent made it past\nme. The fact that we faced\nan imaginary foe makes it no\nless impressive. And knowing\nwhere to pretend block was\npretty damn hard. It was\nmade much easier by those\nnext to me in line always\ndirecting and encouraging. I\nfelt part of the team and even\ndeveloped a hankering to try\ndifferent field positions.\nI take some time out of\nmy budding tackling career\nto talk to some of the guys\nwho were injured but still\nturned up, yet another sign\nof their commitment. I get the\nimpression they miss being on\nthe field, coming up with any\nexcuse to be part of the ses-sion. This is a sport full to the\nbrim with positive energy, not\njust on the pitch but off it too\nwith plenty of socials and the\nupcoming Super Bowl party\nin the Union on February 5th.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a team\nsport with opportunities for all\nnew-comers, I encourage you\nto take the first-session-free\noffer and become Immortal. Despite dropping down\nfrom the Premier League last\nseason, they have recorded\nthe highest number of points\n(and over best points differ-ence) and have won three on\nthe bounce.\nHead on over to their Facebook page to find out more:\nfacebook.com/ImmortalsAFC.\nprobably the extra pastry I\nconsumed that morning.\nNow warmed up, we\nare split into Offense and\nDefence, where each part\nof the team has separate,\ntargeted training. Today\u2019s\nsession is slightly different,\nas these groups are usually\nsplit further into field positions\nwhere each player is given\nwide receivers where we train\nin both running patterns and\ncatching awkward passes (4\nout of 5 isn\u2019t bad) and the\ncoach is always constructive,\ngiving tips on how to improve.\nIn light of the new proposed\ntactics, we move back with\nthe rest of the offense to practice plays described by what\nI now call \u2018The Code\u2019. This\nthe bottom line is this, the supposedly random collection of\nnumbers and words coalesce\ninto precise instructions for\nthe entire team. My previous\ndescription of this sport certainly comes under scrutiny,\nas each player has a specific\ntactic determined by the\ncode, which they must remember and carry out in order\n\\\\ The camaraderie\nand encouragement\nwere evident from\nthe start \u2013 everyone\nwas welcome and\neveryone was\nincluded \\\\\n\n"

Time to deal with the fallout.\nJUST THE TIP\nIt wasn\u2019t a one night stand\nSo you had your one night stand, but clearly you fucked up\nalong the way because you\u2019re still in contact. Stop, before\nthis goes too far. Put your phone down and think about what\nyou\u2019re doing. Avoid excessive texting. Communication should\nbe solely for organising sex. You\u2019re literally just here for the\norgasms. And if they\u2019re being thirsty and texting you all the\ntime, don\u2019t reply right away. You\u2019re not there to meet their\nevery need for validation. Give them your therapist\u2019s number.\nOr mine. Mine is great. We slept together last August and we\nnever fell in love. He\u2019s a professional. You can be one too.\n2\n1\nT\nhis is a follow up to our piece \u2018How to have a one night stand (in Metric)\u2019. For those of you who somehow missed it, we provided a tried-and-tested plan of action\ndesigned to get you laid after a night in Metric. This plan was meant to get you in and out without leaving any trace. But expectedly, you failed. We know that\nsome of you followed our \u2018foolproof\u2019 guidance, but now you\u2019re starting to be concerned that you may be feeling something more than just carnal desire.\nCall us jaded, but we think that falling in love is overrated. There\u2019s nothing like a bad case of The Feels to hold you back when you should be writing that coursework or revising for your finals. We don\u2019t think the expense, time sink, and eventual inevitable heartbreak is worth it, so here\u2019s a handy guide to not falling in love\nwith your one night stand.\nDehumanise them\nThey\u2019re just a piece of meat. Don\u2019t save their\nnumber. That would imply commitment. So what if\nnow you know their name, if you do need to save\nit for whatever reason, don\u2019t use their real name.\nInstead, use a code name, or a vague description\nof the circumstance in which you met, for instance,\n\u201cHalloween ACC #2\u201d.\nMetric comes first\nSo, you\u2019ve arranged to see them again. Don\u2019t cancel plans to\nsee them. You have your life, banging them is a pleasant extra.\nLike guac on your burrito, but it doesn\u2019t cost 75p. You do it after\nyou\u2019ve done whatever else you were doing, or on Sundays when\nyou\u2019d just be lying in bed watching TV anyway (and by that we\nobviously mean masturbating).\nJust say no\n(to emotional blackmail)\nYou\u2019ve successfully booty called them. Do\nnot be convinced to have unsafe sex. It\u2019s just\na trap, and they just want to be exclusive\nwith you after they pass on whatever niche\nstrain of HPV they\u2019re carrying. Sexual\nexclusivity is just a pretence, what they\nreally want is emotional exclusivity and the\ncorresponding emotional blackmail that\ncomes along with it.\nThere\u2019s no \u2018us\u2019 in \u2018friends with benefits\u2019\nMake sure you bring up your fear of commitment and your complete\ninability to form permanent bonds with humans, not just the first time\nyou meet up with them, but every time you meet up with them. This\nmanages their expectations, and stops them falling in love with you.\nThere is a possibility that this will backfire. (Did I mention I\u2019m in love\nwith my therapist?) There is a high proportion of your sex-friends who\nwill just want you more, by virtue of not being able to have you. (But\nit\u2019s cool, we\u2019re just friends. I don\u2019t mind. Honestly.) Play by ear, and\nproceed with caution.\n3\n4\n5\nLef Apostolakis & Tessa Davey\nNetflix and\nchill?\nAlways pack\ncondoms\nSo you fucked up. You\u2019ve been dating for a month and you\ndidn\u2019t have a clue.\nYou realised because you were just grabbing a post-coital snack in the outside world (risky), and you ran into\ntheir friends. For some reason, they ask how long you\u2019ve been seeing each other. HOW DID THEY KNOW?\nWas it something you said or did in the moment? Did you refer to them as babe? Or has your sex-friend been\nspilling the beans? Was this all planned? Maybe this wasn\u2019t a chance encounter! You\u2019re getting paranoid.\nYou\u2019re sweating. All of these thoughts occur in your brain in a millisecond.\nScenario 1: Abort mission\nBefore you have a chance to think, you blurt out,\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hanging out for a week! Just hanging\nout. HANGING OUT!\u201d You turn your head, only to\nwitness the twinkling light of hope depart from your\nsex-friend\u2019s eyes. You know it\u2019s over. Damage control\nsuccess? Congrats.\nScenario 2: Go all in\nYou hear your sex friend say, \u201cwe\u2019ve been seeing each other for a while,\u201d\nand for some reason, this doesn\u2019t make you panic. Your chest fills up with this\nfuzziness. Are you having a heart attack? No, it\u2019s lurrrrve. This sudden surge\nof emotion is getting you hard. Is that a rocket in your pocket? NO! It\u2019s a diamond ring! Boom. Wait, what? How? You find yourself on one knee. Maybe it\nwas a heart attack and now you\u2019re just keeling over. You decide to just go with\nit and propose. Damage control\u2026 success? Congrats.\n10\nThis is your own\nfault\n6\nThere\u2019s no D in frienship\nSo you\u2019re spending three nights a week at their place. Don\u2019t forget\nthough, you\u2019re not there to make friends. Steal the milk, make snarky\ncomments about the decor, and never flush the toilet (only if you\u2019re\ndoing a number one, if you don\u2019t flush a number two, you\u2019re an animal\nand as a serious high-profile publication we can\u2019t be associated with\nyou). And don\u2019t introduce them to your friends. If you happen to run\ninto them, immediately pretend to answer your phone. \u201cWHAT?! MY\nDOG IS ON FIRE?!\u201d or similar will do the trick nicely. Now run away.\nThat\u2019s good. This is why you\u2019ve been hitting the gym all year. That\ncardio\u2019s doing you proud.\nIf you can\u2019t make an excuse, do not refer to the time you spend\ntogether as anything other than hanging out. Yep, just hanging out.\nNothing suspicious going on here. Make sure you make it explicit that\nyou\u2019re just hanging out. You may need to repeat this a few times so\nthat people really know.\nNo sleepovers\nOkay so you\u2019ve failed at this one already, but\nyou can start fixing it now. You get what you want,\nand then you get the hell out of there. Okay, we\nunderstand. They live in Acton, you live in Shepherd\u2019s\nBush, it\u2019s cold outside this time of year. If they live\nmore than 3km away, you\u2019re going to be inclined to\nstay. You just had sex, no matter how short it was, so\nyou\u2019re probably feeling a bit fatigued. Stay there but\nDON\u2019T leave a toothbrush. You leave no trace, like a\nghost shit. (Where did it go?! I heard the splash!)\nYou\u2019re nobody\u2019s\nsnugglebunny\nCuddling is okay, but only as\nlong as it feels good. Don\u2019t put up\nwith Dead Arm Syndrome \u2013 you\u2019re\nhere for you, not for them. It\u2019s still\n\u201cme-time\u201d, even if you\u2019re spending\nit with someone else.\nAvoid affectionate nicknames.\nDon\u2019t by any means call them\nbabe or honey. Do call them\ndude, man, or pal, regardless of\ngender. Pet names are the first\nstep to emotional attachment, and\nafter emotional attachment comes\ncodependence, and we all know\nwhere that leads. Prison.\n7\n8\n9\nAvoid prolonged eye contact\nAs it is commonly known, gazing into someone\u2019s eyes for\nlonger than five minutes (cumulative) means you\u2019ll fall in\nlove with them. It\u2019s like your annual radiation dose, once\nyou\u2019ve reached your max, you need to end it. Immediately. You know you\u2019re in deep shit once you know your\nfuck buddy\u2019s eye colour. It\u2019s also common knowledge that\nduring prolonged eye contact sessions, you lose control of\nyour mouth, and are liable to blurt out something like, \u201cI\nreally like spending time with you\u201d, or, God forbid, the L\nword (and we don\u2019t mean lesbian). If you find them about\nto say something sappy, simply place your finger on their\nlips. \u201cShhhhhh...\u201d\nSTOP RIGHT\nNOW\nEye\ncontact\n=\nBad\nEnough is\nenough\nboo\n\n"

As\npart of TEF, every university\nis required to submit a short\ndocument outlining how\nexactlythey\u2018excelatteaching\u2019,\nwith input from students and\nthe bodies representing them.\nThis seems innocuous enough,\nhowever the introduction of\nthe government\u2019s new Higher\nEducation and Research Bill\n(currently in the Chamber\nof Lords) linked the results\nobtained by universities in the\nTEF with new fee increases.\nFee increases would be\nindexed on inflation, either\nat half the inflation rate for\nuniversities awarded a \u201cmeets\nexpectations\u201d rating, or at the\nfull inflation rate for the other\ncategories.\nIt was \u201cextraordinary\u201d in the fact that people actually turned up \\\\ felix\n\\\\ This put the\nUnion in a difficult\nposition, since it\nhad previously\nadopted a policy\nnot to support fee\nincreases \\\\\nLuke McCrone\nD\nuring this week\u2019s\nextraordinary\ncouncil meeting,\nI proposed a\npaper to seek\np e r m i s s i o n\nfrom Council to approve the\nfollowing: firstly, for the Union\nto make contributions to\nImperial\u2019s Teaching Excellence\nFramework (TEF) submission\nand secondly, for Council to\nreview the Union\u2019s existing\nHigher Education Funding\npolicy. The paper was passed\nsuccessfully.\nThe argument ultimately\nrested on whether the Union\nshould continue to be a strong\nadvocate for the improvement\nof education at Imperial or\nwhether it should make a\npolitical stance against the\nTEF. Following discussion,\nCouncil agreed that continuing\nour activity around striving for\neducational excellence would\nbe of greater benefit to our\nmembers than making efforts\nto rebel against the TEF.\nCouncil members came\nto respect that the TEF\nis inevitably going to be\nimplemented and that some\naspects of the TEF, aside from\nthe inflationary fee rise, have\nOn the other hand, good\nrelations between the Union\nand the College have been\nkey to several advances\nobtained by the students\nin the last few years. The\nCollege is asking the Union to\nco-write the TEF submission,\na mark of goodwill that\nenables the students to have\na real say (some universities\nreduced \u2018student input\u2019 to a\ncouple hundred words on the\nsubmission according to ICU\nPresident Nas Andriopoulos).\nAfter energetic discussions,\nthe motion mandating the\nUnion to engage with College\non the TEF was finally passed\nwith minor amendments, in a\nvictory for the ICU President\nand the Deputy President for\nEducation, Luke McCrone.\nHowever, the subject of tuition\nfees is bound to return to\nthe limelight sooner or later,\nand the Union might have\na tougher time defining the\ncourse of action to follow then.\nto HEFCE requires institutions\nto measure the impact of\ntheir teaching, which should\nencourage academics to be\nmore evidence-based in their\npedagogic approach. TEF\nalso aims to better inform\nstudent choices when deciding\nbetweenuniversitiesbymaking\nmore information about\nteaching quality available to\nprospective students.\nInternational students, which\ncomprise a staggering 40% of\nour member population, are\nnot affected by the TEF since\nthe inflationary fee rise only\nconcerns home students.

And\nyet this is no shortcoming: the\nimmense delicacy of every\nmovement, turn of phrase,\nand pained facial expression (and believe me, they\nare pained) adds up to a\nmasterclass in restraint and\nsubtlety in a performance\nthat conjures the likes of\nLaurence Olivier or Marlon\nBrando in his later years. It\u2019s\na masterwork inside another\nmasterwork \u2013 the film itself.\nManchester by the Sea\nbegins as Lee Chandler\n(Affleck) \u2013 a quiet, bitter,\ncalcified janitor in Quincy,\nMassachusetts with a knack\nfor starting fights \u2013 receives\na phone call informing him of\nthe death of his brother Joe\n(Kyle Chandler). He travels to\nthe small town of Manchester-by-the-Sea to break the\nnews to Joe\u2019s teenage son\nPatrick (Lucas Hedges), but\nlearns upon examining his\nbrother\u2019s will that he has been\nnamed as Patrick\u2019s guardian.\nAs fragments of the family\u2019s\npast begin to appear in\nflashback, and we learn more\nand more about the troubles\nLee and Joe have faced, we\nunderstand the deep grief\nthat sits coiled at the heart of\nthis film. I\u2019m going to avoid\ndetails as much as possible,\nbut you should be warned\nscreen.\nIt\u2019s difficult to forget the\nfeeling you carry after seeing\na truly great, truly sad film.\nI might just be a bit of a\nheartless bastard, but for me,\ncrying during the first viewing\nof a movie is an extremely\nrare occurrence \u2013 12 Years\nA Slave, The Lives of Others,\nand \u2013 most recently \u2013 I,\nDaniel Blake are among the\nsmall handful of films that\nhave managed it. But what\u2019s\neven more rare is that pecu-liar, gravely, sombre feeling\nthat lingers after moments\nlike the ending of Fruitvale\nStation, or the point at which\nBridge To Terabithia\u2019s plot\ntakes a turn (if you\u2019ve seen\nit, you know exactly what I\nmean): one part quiet hope,\nnine parts utter dejection.\nTruth be told, I have never felt\nit as strongly or for so long as\nI did after I first saw Manchester by the Sea. It\u2019s one thing\nto make an easy tear-jerker\nof a film, but it takes an enormous amount of talent to tell a\nstory this crushing and make\nit as immensely watchable\nas it is throughout, for so\nmany reasons. I\u2019ve picked my\nbrain over and over to find a\nsingle fault in this film since\nmy first viewing of it, and\nI simply cannot. Lonergan\nhas achieved something\nwholly incredible. It probably\nwon\u2019t be the 2017 film that\nI rewatch the most \u2013 La La\nLand already has a pretty\nsteadfast hold on that spot \u2013\nbut I will be astounded if I see\na more moving film this year.\nTom Stephens\nA restrained exploration of\ngrief, with exceptionally strong\nperformances from Michelle\nWilliams and Casey Affleck,\nManchester by the Sea is the\nmost moving film of the year.\nnow: Manchester by the Sea\nis devastating to watch.\nBut, surprisingly enough,\nit also has more laughs in\nit than any comedy I\u2019ve\nwatched for a while \u2013 not\nin any sort of dark comedy\nsense, but rather because the\nscript by Kenneth Lonergan, who also directed, is\nbristling with conversations\nso naturalistic and organically funny that the slightest\nof reactions or the smallest\nof quips between friends hit\nlike the punchline to a standup\u2019s best joke. Perhaps this is\nalso because the characters\nhaving these conversations\nare so perfectly realised \u2013\nthe film is populated by such\nwell-sketched people that\nwithin an extremely short\ntime from meeting them they\nfelt like close. It even gave\nme the all-too-rare treat of\nhaving a moment to recollect,\nsome twenty-five minutes into\nthe film, how glad I was that\nI had so much more time to\nspend with these wonderfully\nflawed people I was watching\non-screen.\nThere may be yet another\nreason for this, however:\nthe all-round, across-the-board brilliance of the\nperformances. This may\nwell be the performance of\nAffleck\u2019s career (a description\nI certainly don\u2019t use lightly\nas a huge fan of his), but\nhe is backed up on all sides\nby the supporting players:\nLucas Hedges pitches Patrick\nperfectly, with just the right\nMichelle Williams and Casy Affleck deliver devistatingly\nunderstated performances \\\\ Allstar/StudioCanal\nManchester\nby the Sea\n(apart from being white):\nshouting. It has seemed\nthroughout the years that the\nonly performances by leading\nactors that really catch\nawards committees\u2019 attention\nare the ones that go off with\na flash and a bang \u2013 nuance\nand subtlety be damned. In\nfact, Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s\nlandmark win last year for\nhis role in The Revenant saw\nhim in a performance that\nfeatured more yelling and\nexasperated grunting than\nactual speech.\nSo upon hearing the amount\nof Oscar buzz currently\norbiting Casey Affleck for his\nperformance in Manchester\nby the Sea, you might be\nled to believe, as I was, that\nthis year might end up no\ndifferent. Imagine my shock\nwhen by the time the movie\nwas over I had counted just\none scene \u2013 a very short one\nat that, and only about ten\nminutes into the 137-minute\nruntime \u2013 in which Affleck\nraised his voice.
