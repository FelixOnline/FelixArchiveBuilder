    "content": "t LETTERS\nBoolery Woolery\nDear Sir\nI am not a close friend of Ray Taverner,\nbut I must say that from where I was standing\nthe delays in the final is ation of the accounts\nappeared to be due almost entirely to factors\noutside his control, contrary to what was\nimplied in last week's Boolery Woolery.\nThe dates of the meetings of the Finance\nand Executive Committees are published in\nthe College Year Card. Had your reporter\nbothered to look it up, he would have found\nthat the meeting referred to took place on the\nvery day that the article appeared, not 'next\nweek'. It was never planned that the accounts\nwould be considered at that meeting, and\nneither were they at the corresponding\nmeeting last year.\nI believe that FELIX has a valid role to\nplay in exposing inefficiency, identifying\nprejudices, and debunking pomposity,\nwherever they are to be found. But if it is to\ndo the job well, its reporters must get their\nfacts right. If they cannot do so, it would be\nbetter if such articles did not appear at all.\nI am in no position to comment on the other\n'facts' contained in last week's article, but\nfrom what I have seen so far this year I think\nyour readers will be well advised to treat\neverything they read in Boolery Woolery\nwith a considerable pinch of salt.\nYours faithfully\nMalcolm Aldridge\nAssistant Secretary (Finance)\nApartheid\nDear Sir\nI spoke to one of the exhibitors at the RS M Open Day about the Apartheid System in\nSouth Africa. Referring to the subordinate\nposition of the black majority population\nthere, he said:\n'You keep rabbits in a rabbit hutch, don't you?\n'You don't allow them on the sofa'.\nHow many of this year's IC graduates will\ngo burrowing in South Africa, and so help\nkeep the cages firmly shut?\nYours faithfully\nJ Michaelis\nMech Eng 2\nA bore\nwrites\nDear Sir,\nHaving acquired an appetite for this sort of\nthing I wondered who I should slag off next.\nA visit to the palatial JCR eating emporium,\neuphemistically called a refectory, leaves one\nin no doubt of the passage of obscenities that\ncould be used to describe that abominable\noffence to all taste and decency. The editor,\nrevelling in this upsurge of acrimonious\nbanter, has tried to persuade me to comment\nfurther on the dirty doings of 'my chums' in\nthe diving club, some libellous statement\nsuch as 'illicit use of wet-suits overnight' was\none suggestion, but I have no intention of\ndamning them again. Never kick a dog when\nit's down, especially when it bites back like a wet sponge, is my aphorism for the week.\nNo, I wish to draw attention to the\nunpleasant upsurge in Christian awareness.\nHave you not been accosted in the street,\npurchased a record you were handed for free,\nand asked to repeat a chant for the\nbetterment of life and humanity? Well last\nnight I had these two Bible bash ers come\nknocking on my door. Responsible\nmissionary position types. You know...Anorak, sweater, bible; wanted to\ndiscuss the existence of God and the like.\nLike a fool I said 'Yes, by all means come in'.\nSo in they came and sat on my bed. I questioned their integrity, feeling that their\nhaircuts were just a little short. 'Not from a sect by any chance?'\n'Oh No!' he exclaimed, 'I'm a member of the\nChurch of England'. I took this to be at least\nsome measure of respectability so we got into\na discussion on the authenticity of the\nGospel. I accepted the existence of some chap\ncalled Jesus but suggested in a round about\nway that he was merely a confidence\ntrickster, freeloading food, transport and\nwomen where ever he could. I went on to\nadmit that there was a definite need for a god\nin the world and what a pity it would be if he\nreally did exist. I mean we have miss d out on\nsuch a great opportunity. My audience was\nmuch encouraged by this so I continued with\na little analogy. Consider the devil receiving a fresh batch of dead atheists. 'It's so good to\nsee all you non-believers together. I bet you\nfeel a right bunch of charlie s.' Unfortunately\nthis passed right over his head although I did\ndetect a slight snigger from his sidekick.\nWhether this was a nervous inflection over\nthe word devil I shall never know as they left\nshortly afterwards. On parting I'm sure I noticed a slight grimace when I mentioned\nthat I would like to attend their discussion\nmeeting. See you there.\nYours evangelical ly, Everard Snivel\n(Real name supplied)\nFELIX\nRefectory\nBoycott\nRefectory food has been brought up again at\naUG M. Hugh Southey and Martin Taylor,\nwho between them have sat on most\ncommittees worth sitting on, considered a refectory boycott the only way of getting\nhome to the College the point that Mooney is\nusing a wholly arbitrary way of deciding price\nincreases. On top of unpalatable, rudely\nserved, wrongly labelled, incompetently\nproduced food, a ludicrous pricing scheme is\nhardly likely to attract students to IC's refectories. The present inactivity of the\nuseful people in the College on the refectory\nmatter is explicable only if College want a refectory service for extravagant formal\ndinners and see that the only way of\nmaintaining it is to disguise it as a student\nrefectory service. Students already boycott\nMooney every lunch and dinner time in their\nthousands, make no mistake.\nLet the College take seriously their\nresponsibilities to feed students quickly and\ncheaply and to appoint as a replacement for\nMr Mooney someone who will adopt such\nradically different policies as to reverse the\ndecline that the refectories have been in for\ndecades.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Ajay,\nMartin, Dave, Dave, Jon, Pete, Richard,\nPatrick, David Ashforth, Mike, Rosemary,\nTony, Grenville, and all the colla tors.

Now that as\nDP he has to meet College\nofficials face to face he seems to\nthink the only way to get things\ndone is to be nice to them, and\nnot to do anything that might\nruffle their feathers a bit. He\nclaimed that it would be\n'blackmail' to state our intention\nof holding boycotts if and when\nthere are any further random\nprice increases. He wanted this to\nbe reduced to the threat of\nintroducing such a policy once\nany increase has been imposed.\nThis would be a classic example\nof shutting the stable door once\nthe horse has bolted. Mr Parry\nseems to be yet another\nsabbatical who, whilst taking\noffice with the best of intentions,\nhas been seduced by the endless\nround of freebies and committee\nmeetings into think ng like a College official. At this rate it\nwon't be long before we find the\nUnion Office moving to the\nSherfield building where all the\nother branches of the\nadministration have their offices.\nWearing a poppy in the week\nbefore Remembrance Sunday is a symbol of respect for all those\nwho were killed or injured\nfighting for Britain in two world\nwars. It was distressing to see\nthen that ICC ND, like other\nbranches of that organization,\nhave been selling white poppies.\nTo try and make a political point\nout of Remembrance Sunday is\nbad enough, but the selling of\nwhite poppies is surely a calculated insult to the memory\nof those who sacrificed their lives\nto ensure that future generations\ncould grow up in a free and\nindependant Britain. I hope that\nthis attempt by the pacifists and\nappeasers in C ND to hijack a solemn occasion of national\nmourning for their own blinkered ends will be firmly\nrejected.\nFi lix Friday 9 November 1984\n\n"

Also there\nwas a notable performance from\nVernon Morris which enabled\nhim to end the match in a local\nhospital after failing to control\nthe ball with his chin!\nTeam: P Choudhury, C Honey, I Mace, C Harrison, V Morris, M Shepherd, R Ellis, D Whitton, S Otto, P Dedlforce, John\nSpencer, S Brooker.\nIC\u20140 vs Trent Valley\u20144\nFor once IC couldn't make any\nexcuses about the umpires or\npitch for what was a disappointing performance.\nAfter c once e ding an early goal,\nthings began to look up with\nsome excellent play by the\ncentre forward, but support for\nhim was very much lacking. IC\nlost their way near the end of the\nhalf and consequently two goals\nwere c once ede d. The second half started with a more determined IC team\nwinning more possession but\nwhen Trent Valley were reduced\nto ten men near the end IC were\nstill unable to convert their\nposse sion into goals. Just before\nthe final whistle Trent Valley\nscored, ending a second half\nwhich initially promised so much.\nTeam: J West, A Stewart, P Smith, KMcCormick, M Hall, M Hedges, P Oliver, P Dubenski,\nJeff, N Hope, D Gott.\nSQUASH\nFrom the number of ladder\nresults written up in the sports\ncentre so far, it would seem that\nyou are all totally bored with\nplaying squash. Therefore, IC\nSquash club are going ice skating\n(aren't we!) on Tuesday 13\nNovember. This will be a good\nway for everybody to meet other\nplayers and should be really good\nfun. Last year everyone had a Chinese afterwards, this year we\nmight try one each. We are also\nhaving a trip to a restaurant to be\nannounced, on Friday 30\nNovember \u2014 sign up on the\nnoticeboard in the Sports centre\nif interested.\nORIENTEERING\nNewForest\nWith head-lamps blazing (except\nDon's!) club member's competed in the Southern Night\nChampionships last Saturday.\nCourses were long for a night\nevent, though conditions made\nfor fast times. Inspired by the\nthought of a mega-feed back at\nSimon's, all IC competitors\nfinished in the top 20 or so in our\nclasses.\nThe following day the team ran\nin the November Classic in the\nNew Forest; where long fast\ncourses across open land and\ngolden forest are traditional.\nNew man Rob Lea finished\nwithin eight minutes of the\nformer British Championship\n(leaving Simon trailing) while a new force in W21B emerged with\nPatsy Wood.\n10 PIN BOWLING\nFirstly, thanks to the hard core\nwho have supported the 10-PIN\nbowling club week after week.\nSecondly, since IC have got a match coming up very soon,\nmore people are needed, more\nthan play week after week that is,\nto come along on Wednesday.\nAnybody who has ever been 10-PIN bowling before and, dare I say it, enjoyed it, I plead with you\n(grovel, grovel) to do something\ndifferent on a Wednesday\nafternoon. You will enjoy it, I guarantee, especially if you bring\nsome friends as well.\nAnyway, enough of the\ncrawling, see you all in the Chem\nEng foyer, by 2 . 3 0 pm Wednesday.\nWATERPOLO\nYou can\nbank on us\nIC\u20149 Lloyds\u20144\nIC's intense team training paid\noff quickly in the rematch with\nLloyds. By the end of the first\nquarter College were 4\u20140\nahead. This water polo match\nwas again one for the whole\nsquad \u2014 each quarter the\nImperial team was altered so as\nto give every member a swim.\nThe last two quarters of the\ngame resulted in IC scoring five\nmore goals. Fitness was the\ndeciding factor as the Imperial\nwater polo players swam quickly\nthrough several sound attacking\nmoves. The final score reflects\nthe steady improvement over the\nfirst few weeks of term. Next\nweek sees the University of\nLondon knockout competition.\n(Water polo and swim min mg,6.30 pm. Mondays and Fridays,\nIC Sports Centre).\nSNOOKER\nCue for\naction\nThis week saw a rest from league\nfixtures as IC began their\ncampaign in the annual Handicap tournament. Two\nteams qualify from the initial\nstages and with qualification\ndepending solely on the\naggregate points score it was\nimportant not only to win but to\nwin well.\nO CL are a3rd division side\nand as such started the match\nwith a156 point advantage over\nImperial. In spite of this with\nMike Powell, Aidrian Feasby,\nJaved Quereshi and John West\neach winning both of their frames\nIC moved to a handsome 9\u20143\nvictory.\nMore importantly the deficit of\n156 points was turned into a winning margin of 51 points\nwhich will certainly not damage\nour hopes of moving to the later\nstages of the competition.\nUi U Travel is now on campus\nTUN I OP,A common r \u00a3f \u2022\nR.OOM IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nTHE JUNIOR COMMON ROOM\nSHERFIELD BUILDING\nPRINCE CONSORT ROAD\nSW7 2AZ Tel: 589 8882\nsim10 Friday 9 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "OPINION\nWINTER\nSANA Scientists Against Nuclear\nArms\nMech Eng 220 3pm A/ ed 14th Nov\nTHE WORLD AFTER NUCLEAR WAR\nThe Nuclear Winter - Fact or\nFiction?\nWhen Dr Richard Turcp and Dr Anne\nEhrlich come to Imperial College\nnext week as part of their much-heralded tour of Britain, along with\nProf Paul Ehrlich and Dr Georgiy\nGolistyn, the anti-nuclear weapon\nlobby will at least be given some\nstrong evidence for it's case. The\nextent of, or the means of achieving\nnuclear disarmament is obviously\ndependent on one's political bias, but\nthe nuclear winter theory (which is\nwhat it is) cuts right across any\npolitical affiliation's and appeals to all\nof us simply on grounds of\ncommon sense. Are we prepared to\nrisk extinction of not only the human\nspecies but ALL life as we know it for\nthe. sake of our so-called national\nsecurity? The results of several\ndifferent independent studies on the\nglobal climatic effects of a nuclear\nexchange in the northern\nhemisphere are all basically the\nsame. Since the predicted\nconsequences are eco-catastrophic\nand have already prompted the US\nand British Governments to initiate\ntheir own studies, just how strong is\nthe evidence for a nuclear winter?\nWhat are the likely long-term effects\nof a nuclear exchange? What size of\nnuclear exchange would be required\nto produce these long-term climatic\nchanges?\nTo date, the major study on the\natmospheric consequences (Nuclear\nWinter: Global Consequences of\nMultiple Nuclear Explosions. RP Turco, OB Toon TP Ackerman, JB Pollark, Carl Sagan, 23 December\n1983, Vol 222 P12831300 \u2014 referred\nto as TTAPS) has come up with some\nfairly chilling predictions. Basically\nwhat happens is this: With the\ndetonation of nuclear weapons there\nwould be an enormous amount of\ndust hurled into the troposphere and\nabove it, the stratosphere together\nwith smoke/soot from the very large-scale urban and rural (particularly\nforest) fires. The dust and soot would\nform a cloud enveloping much of the\nhemisphere causing drastic\necological effects for months after a nuclear war. There would be a considerable drop in light intensity\nand other alterations in solar\nradiation, these include an\nincrease in UV-B after some months.\nA second disastrous consequence\nwould be the drop in ground\ntemperature, over the area of the\nhemisphere enveloped by the cloud.\nA third consequence would be\nalteration of the gas composition of\nthe atmosphere and the increase in\ntoxic chemicals released principally\nfrom fires within urban/industrial\ncomplexes. A fourth consequence\narises from the radioactive\nexposure of human beings directly,\nand indirectly through absorption by\nplants and animals in the food chain. TTAPS infact applied their model\nto several different scenarios:\nexchanges of between 100 ana\nDr B Morrison Aero\n15,000 megatons (15 000 MT is a reasonable estimate of the total\nworld stockpile), a varying\ndistribution of targets (eg urban and\nrural target) and different ratios of\nground to air burst.\nThese scenarios all gave\npredictions of temperature drops of\nbetween \u2014 10\u00b0C and \u2014 30\u00b0C. Even\nsmall nuclear exchanges could\ntrigger severe after-effects. A scenario involving only 100MT exploded in the air over cities could\nproduce a two-month interval of\nsub freezing land temperatures, with\na minimum near \u201423\u00b0C. In this\nscenario, thousands of fires would be\nignited and the smoke from these\ncould generate a period of cold and\ndark almost as severe as the baseline\ncase of 5000MT. The temperature\ndrops not only because of the sun's. radiation being absorbed and\nreflected by the dust, but also by an\ninverse green house effect where\nradiated (infra-red) heat from the\nearth is not blocked by the smoke\nand dust.\nHow reliable are these\ncalculations? The study by TTAPS\nused a one-dimensional model\n(height) for modelling the effect of\nparticles. Other studies by different\npeople using 3D and two \u2014\ndimensional models (latitude \u2014\nheight) and circulation models\nsupport the TTAPS results. Also a compilation of data from five major\nvolcanic eruptions this century\nshowed a cooling pattern similar to\nthat predicted by the general\ncirculation models.\nThe consequences for animal and\nplant life are difficult to gauge\naccurately but some basic\nconclusions are clear. For plants a five per cent reduction in sunlight is\nsufficient for photosynthesis not to\nsustain the plant. Oats, Barley and\nRye will be very badly hit by\ntemperatures of 0\u00b0C in spring,\nwhereas they can withstand lower\nthan \u2014 10\u00b0C in late October. Drops\nof only a few degrees could be\ncast as tropic.A whole rice crop can\nbe lost if the temperature drops\nbelow 13\u00b0C, rice is the staple diet of\nabout half the worlds population. The\nincreased UV radiation will harm\nplant leaves and reduce photo-synthesis, it will also reduce the yield\nof the plant and weaken it's resistance to other hazards. It\nreduces animal resistance to\ninfection too.\nIt seems likely that the major\nfindings of these studies are unlikely\nto be contradicted. Of course\nproponents of nuclear deterrence\nmay well say that predictions of a nuclear winter confirm the\neffectiveness of deterrence. This\nseems almost too ghastly to\ncontemplate, logic gone be ser k. Perhaps one day, the advocates of\nnuclear weapons will realise that the\nfreedom that they wish to preserve\nhas been all but eroded by these\nsame weapons.\nCommon\nCause\nWOMEN AND PEACE\n'Women don't feel as men do about\nwar. They are the mothers of the\nrace. Men think of the economic\nresults, women think of the grief and\npain'.\n. (Dr Aletta Jacobs, Holland's first\nwoman Doctor, speaking in 1915).\nThe Women's peace movement\ndid not start at Greenham common\nas many people seem to think .\nWomen first came together as the\nFemale Peace Society in America in\n1820; but the roots of the movement\nstem from much farther back in\nhistory. For centuries women have\nbeen bearing the grief and pain of\nwars \u2014 mourning for sons,\nhusbands, lovers, brothers, going to\ntheir deaths in 'wars of plunder, wars\nof conquest, wars of religion, wars of\nPRIDE, wars of succession, wars of\nidle speculation, wars of unjust\ninterference...'. As Anne Barbould\nwrote in 1793.\nThroughout all those centuries\nsome women have spoken out\nagainst war and militarism. Now\nseeing the threat of nuclear\nextermination, their voc ies are\nlouder than ever. Today's Women's Peace Movement is widespread and\nen comp a sees women from all walks\nof life \u2014 not just 'man-hating lesbians'\nas the popular press would have us\nbelieve. Greenham women are\nindeed everywhere.\nOn November 15th, Danielle\nGrunberg, international coordinator\nof the Woman's Peace Alliance, will\nbe speaking at IC on the importance\nof the womens peace movement in\nthe struggle for disarmament. The\nWomen's Peace Alliance is an\n'umbrella' organisation of groups and\nindividuals from many countries,\ninvolved in a variety of activities. This\nshould be an illuminating talk giving a wide perspective view of the\nWomen's Peace Movement today\nand its role in the future. Everybody\nis welcome to attend the meeting, at\n1.00pm on Thursday, November 15,\nin Physics LT 2.\nFELIX Friday 9 November 1984\n\n"

    "content": "CLETTERS;\ncontinued from page 2\nNo to\nloans\nBrown\nDear Sir\nMr Brown's proposal for the restoration of\nfreedom and responsibility to the individual\nmakes entertaining reading. The growing\nsupport for the view proposed is reflected\namongst students by the rapidly f?) increasing\nmembership of Consoc, now a staggering\n1.1% of college.\nHe rightly states that 'the aim of higher\neducation finance should be to make it more\nwidely available'. He claims that the current\nsystem is inequitable, discriminating against\nthe children of manual workers. Would\nhaving to pay their own maintenance\nencourage more to come? As for 'having it\neasy at the taxpayers' expense', as most\nstudents at Imperial know, this is not the\ncase. It is also claimed that 'the children of\nhigher income earners are being sub sidi sed through government grants by the taxes of\nthose with lower incomes'. He obviously has\nlittle comprehension of the income tax\nsystem.\nThe loan mechanism proposed would be\nunworkable, as banks would be unwilling to\nlend large sums of money for no real return.\nIt is equally unlikely that industry would be\nwilling to further fund higher education, or\npay graduates more simple because of earlier\nyears of hardship.\nIf the country is to prosper, there must be a sound educational foundation on which\nindustry can build. Mr Brown's proposal\nwould make it very much more difficult for\nthose from all backgrounds to progress to\nhigher education.\nYours faithfully\nA Winterton Me 2\nW Hooper Me 2\nCoal or\nfood?\nDear Sir\nI went to hear the speakers from the NUM on Thursday 1 November and I would like to\nsay that the lady who stood up against them\nhad a lot of courage. I'm only sorry I did not\nhave the guts to back her up but I was\nastounded by the backing the striking miners\nreceived from the people there and also afraid\nthe 'mob' were around to shut up any\nopposition!\nAt the end of the meet in tg a collection was\ntaken and people were giving pound notes. I could list a hundred more deserving causes\nthan the striking miners, above all the\nEthiopian famine and if a student can afford\nto give the striking miners a pound, they\nshould give fifty pounds to help Ehtiopia.\nName wit held by request.\nbugger\nDear Sir\nGraham Brown's article about student\nloans last week contained a number of\ndamaging assumptions and flat\ncontradictions. For instance he states that\ngrants cause student financial hardship and\nyet also cause taxpayers to resent students as\n'having it easy'. If we accept that students are\nhard up, this implies that it is the taxpayers'\nimage of students which is at fault. Those in\nthe know are more resentful of rich self-employed people like solicitors and farmers\nusing Mr Brown's Conservative 'independence, responsibility and self-determination' to employ accountants to\nfiddle their tax returns and obtain a full grant\nfor their children.\nMr Brown also claims, incredibly, that\ngrants cause low participation by children of\nmanual workers in further education, only to\nlater state that many low-income working\nclass children 'have either no wish to take\nadvantage of higher education or lack the\nability to do so'. This contradiction shows\nboth his bias against the working-class and\nhis spurious use of a convenient statistic to\ntry and further his argument. I would have\nthought that giving a full grant to low income\nfamilies encourages the student to go into\nfurther education.\nThe most damaging assumption in the\narticle was that the Education budget needs\n'savings' ie cuts, and hence that grants should\ngo. Education should be a right, and the more\neducation the better. We have few enough\nstudents in this country as it is \u2014 we\nshouldn't be proving students' 'resilience' by\nputting the millstone of a large debt around\ntheir necks before they even start earning.\nThe lack of funds in education causes a genuine waste of talent, and yet there is no\nreal problem with resources. For instance, by\njust cancelling the Trident nuclear missile\nprogramme with its massive and unnecessary\nincrease in British nuclear capability, we\ncould save \u00a3 10 billion (or even more, give the\ncontinuing plunge of the pound). This money\ncould be used to improve and even expand\neducational opportunities so that a higher\nproportion of our intelligent British people\n(especially with falling birthrates) can benefit\nfrom higher education and receive a grant\naccording to their level of income.\nThe idea of loans is a loser. In the US over\n80% of loans are never repaid. And we have a form of loan in this country already, albi et only \u00a3200 on average compared to \u00a32100\nunder a full loans scheme. This British loan is\ncalled an overdraft. It reminds people of their\nfinancial vulnerability and their need to get a job, but it doesn't saddle them with a big debt\n(However it's repaid, \u00a37000 odd is a lot of\nmoney). Even if loans encourage students to\ntake vocational subjects, there aren't the\nplaces available for them, due (again) to\ngovernment cuts. In the end it is policy that\ndetermines resource-levels, and the Thatcher\ngovernment seems to prefer threatening to\nkill Russians to educating British people.\nYour\nTony Atkins\nChristmas Dinner\nTuesday 11 December\n-open to all staff and students-Smoked Trout\nHorseradish sauce\nRoast Duckling Bigarade\nPotatoes a la Daupinoise\nRed Cabbage Normande\nPetit Pois\nChristmas Pudding\nMince Pies\nBrandy Butter\nDessert Fruit\nPetit Fours\nCoffee\nPrice: students \u00a39 (\u00a33 subsidy)\nStaff \u00a310 (\u00a32 subsidy)\nIncludes sherry, wines and port.

    "content": "Founded 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nUGM MOTIONS\nHuge Boycotts\nIC Union will hold lightening Refectory Boycotts if College\nput up prices again, Tuesdays UGM decided.\nHugh Southey, proposing the\nmotion on refectory prices spoke\nof the haphazard way price\nincreases were currently decided\nand called for the swift\ninstallation of the long-overdue\ncomputerised accounting system.\nAny further arbitrary increases\nshould, said Mr Southey, be met\nby forceful action from the\nUnion; students were always in a minority at committee level and\nCollege authorities continuously\nignored their views.\nOpposing the motion David\nParry, ICU Deputy President,\ncalled the motion 'ill-conceived,\nill-timed and ill-worded'. He\nsuggested a less militant\napproach, calling the use of\nboycotts a form of blackmail,\nand advocated employing the\nthreat of possible action as a means of enforcing the students'\nviewpoint. Mr Southey responded that College authorities were no longer\nswayed by threats \u2014 there had\nbeen no refectory boycott for the\nlast five years. An organised\nseries of weekly boycotts, where\nby only one outlet would be\naffected at any one time of day,\nwould exert maximum pressure\non the refectory committee. After\nquestions, the motion was\ncarried conclusively.\nThe motion on student loans\nwas proposed by Graham\nBrown, chairman of IC Conservative Society. Mr Brown\nfavoured loans as an alternative\nto the means-tested grant since\nthey afforded students a greater\ndegree of independence. His\ndevotion to a 'market-force' view\nof the economy was not well\nreceived, however.\nA radical amendment to the\nmotion was then proposed,\nsupporting the award of a full\ngrant to all students. Speaking\nfor the amendment Mr Gareth\nFish referred to the loan system\nas 'a millstone around a student's neck' and suggested a full\nmandatory award as a more\neffective way to make students\nmore independent. Mr Brown\ncited examples of other countries\nwhich had a loans system, and\ndid not foresee that students\nwould have problems making\nrepayments. In spite of this the\nmeeting voted to accept the\namendment. The amended\nmotion was proposed by Mr Fish\nand subsequently passed.\nThe QT Hit Squad at Tuesday's UGM\nWashington\n:;\n:::iM::\n;;:\nPictures above is Geno Washington who, on Wednesday, started what\nwill undoubtedly be a successful comeback, at The End of the World\nparty in the JCR.

A substantial rebate is expected to\nbe paid.\nThe case dates from 1973 when\nthe rate able value of the central\nblock of College Buildings was\nreviewed by the Inland Revenue.\nCollege disagreed with the\nvaluation and following negotiations fixed a new value\nwith the Inland Revenue. The\nposition was fur the T complicated\nwhen the Huxley Building was\nincluded in the Rating list from\n1977, however college and the\nInland Revenue agreed on the\nnew total valuation.\nWestminster City Council\nappealed to the Greater London\nValuation Court against the\noriginal review and also\nincreased the percentage used to\nreach the rate able value from\n3'/2 % to 6% (the normal\ncommercial rate) in 1980. In the\npast Universities and Colleges\nhave been charged rates at lower\nlevels under the terms of the\n'Provincial Memorandum' which\nfavours educational premises\nover commercial ones. The Court\ndecided in favour of Westminister Council for higher\nrate able values but reduced the\npercentage from 6% to 4'/2 %.\nAs this case affected many\nColleges and Universities all over\nthe country, the University\nGrants Committee decided to use\nImperial College as a test case\nand appealed against the courts\ndecision at a Land Tribunal. The\noutcome of this was a reduction\nin the rate able value to below the\noriginal 1973 level. The Land\nTribunal also decided to reduce\nthe rates back to the original 3'/2.\nThe ruling, seen as a victory for\nUniversities and Colleges , is still\nsubject to a28 day appeal\nalthough College hope that\nWestminster Council have no\ngrounds for this.\nFree!

    "content": "NUS\u2014\nclosed shop?\nA bill to make National Union of\nStudents (NUS) membership\nvoluntary was given its first\nreading in Parliament last week.\nMrs Edwina Currie MP, Derbyshire South( Con), introduced a ten minute rule bill\nin the House of Commons last\nweek, to give students the right to\nrefuse membership of the NUS. The bill would mean that a student's written permission\nwould be required before an\neducational establishment gave a proportion of a student's grant to\nthe student union and then to the\nNUS. This would end what Mrs\nCurrie claimed was a closed\nshop.\nMrs Currie told FELIX that\nshe is seeking a meeting with Sir\nKeith Joseph, the Secretary of\nState for Education and Science,\nand believed that it might be\npossible for NUS membership to\nbe made voluntary without extra\nlegislation. She claimed that the\nlack of opposition to her bill\nshowed a major change in\nparliamentary opinion since the\nlast time the subject was debated\nin 1978, when it aroused\ncontroversy.\nColin Brown, of the NUS, spoke angrily about the bill,\naccusing Mrs Currie of 'wasting\nparliamentary time', and stating\nthat if she used the language of\ntrade unionism to describe the\nNUS, she was making a mistake.\nMrs Currie admitted that she had\nnot consulted the NUS before\nintroducing the bill, and she had\nrefused to see a delegation from\nher local branch of the NUS when they arrived in Parliament\nto lobby her.\nTen minute rule bills have\nvirtually no chance of becoming\nlaw, but serve as a useful test of\nHouse of Commons opinion.\nImperial College has not been\naffiliated to the NUS since 1978.\nObituary\nAlasdair Scott-Moncrieff\nAlasdair Scott-Moncrieff came\nto Imperial College eighteen\nyears ago and soon involved\nhimself in the City and Guilds\nUnion and the West London\nChaplaincy, the two organ-is at ions, which along with the\nCivil Engineering Department,\nwere the focus of his formidable\nenergy and interest. Alasdair\nenjoyed the company of students.\nHe lived for some years as a staff\nmember of Tizard and Linstead\nHalls and always took an active\npart in the life of the hall. He was\na founder member of two of the\nWest London Chaplaincy's student community houses.\nAlasdair quickly moved to the\nheart of the Chaplaincy, taking\non the considerable burden of\ntreasurer and administrator of its\nshort-life housing scheme. The\nheart is the right description of\nAlasdair's place, because he\nreally cared for the people in the\nhouses he was looking after, and\nhis great energy and ability were\ndirected by the vision of\ncommunity the houses rep-resented. That same vision\nmotivated his j work for City and\nGuilds Union, and his wall-building, drain laying, surveying\nand concrete mixing for the\nconversion of Micklepage Barn\nin Sussex into a place for many\ncommunities to use.\nUnhappily the community he\nworked so hard to provide for\nothers evaded him. He found it\nhard to believe in the warmth and\naffection people had for him, or\nto relax into the deeper\nfriendships that were offered. He\nconcealed his long struggle\nagainst depression and despair so\nwell that even those close to him\nhad little idea how serious it was\nuntil the despair so undermined\nhis will to fight that he ended his\nlife.\nWe may, with difficulty, be\nable to replace the functions\nAlasdair carried out in the\nCollege, Chaplaincy, and Union,\nbut those close to him know\nnothing will be the same without\nthe man himself.\nThose of us who can, will pray\nthat Christ who penetrated the\ndepths of darkness and despair\nand overcame them, will fill\nAlasdair now with the affection,\nwarmth and joy he longed for,\nand convince him that these\nthings really are for him.\nDavid Ashforth, Chaplain\nC& GU write: Alasdair was\nGuild's Senior Treasurer for\ntwelve years. This was a job\nwhich carried no material reward\nfor the many hours of work\nwhich it entailed and yet it was\nalways accomplished without\ncomplaint. He was also actively\ninvolved with the care of\nBoanerges, the Guilds veteran\ncar, and will be sadly missed by\nhis colleagues on the Bo\ncommittee.\nA memorial service will be held\non Thursday 15 November at\n1.30pm in Holy Trinity Church,\nPrince Consort Road. All students and staff are welcome to\nattend.\nBo romps home!\nImperial College supplied one\nofficial and two unofficial\ncompetitors in the London to\nBrighton veteran car run last\nSunday.\nOne star of the day was\nundoubtedly the C&G mascot\nBo, the official runner, who made\nthe trip in approximately five\nhours. Bo was due to arrive in\nBrighton at between 12.30 and\n1.00pm but due to a minor\nlubrication problem was 90\nminutes late. Driver Simon\nChamberlain said the problems\nwere unfortunate as Bo had been\nrunning 'really well lately'; an\nexplanation which met with some\nscepticism from very cold\nsupporters.\nUnofficial entrants were the\nRCS fire-engine 'Jez', which\npowered itself there and back,\nand Derrick, a1926 motorcycle\nowned by C&G. Everyone finished the day with\nthe usual 'bumper car' fight in the\nfair go und. FELIX Friday 9 November 1984 3\n\n"

    "content": "EREVIEWS;\nSINGLES\n4$ rpm\nMatt Bianco: Half A Minute\nThis is absolutely and\nutterly brilliant. Ever since\n'Get Out Of Your Lazy Bed'\nI 've been waiting for an\nequally bopp y single from the\nBianco Trio. This is it. Get the\n12 inch extended version with\n'Matt's Mood' on the B side, or\neven better, get the album\n'Whose Side Are You On.' If\nyou can't dance to this I should start worrying \u2014 even\nmy granny likes it!\nPrefab Sprout: When Love\nBreaks Down\nThedebut disc, 'Don'tSing',\nmade enough money to keep\nKitchenware Records in\nbusiness. Now it's a matter of\nwhether the follow-up can\nachieve anything like the\nsame success. It's about time\nindie labels produced commercial music instead of\npolitical statements. Prefab\nmanage to get the moodiness\nof The Smiths, without subjecting the listener to their\ndreariness and depression. I love the vocal harmonies, and\nghostly female backing. But\nwill it sell?\nSlade: All Hold Hands\nYou've guessed it \u2014 it's Christmas time again, and\nNoddy Holder and the boys\nare back again with yet\nanother 'Merry Xmas Everybody' sound-alike. Mustn't put\nit down though. I'm sure once\nthe Yuletide spirit starts\nflowing, I 'll be the first to join\nin the party sing-along. One thing I don't understand\nMat Bianco-new single just released.\nthough, is who buys these\nsingles? There must be a million people out there\nsomewhere with copies of\n'Birdie Song', 'Agadoo' and\n'Shadappa Your Face'. They'll\nlove this.\nHelen & The Horns; Surrey\nWith A Fringe On Top\nRCA are still pushing the\ncountry billy angle on Helen,\nsix months after it went out of\nfashion. It's a pity 'cause she's got a great voice. Dave Jago\nand the rest of the horns are\nfrom IC, and have played\nSouthside Bar several times,\nwhich is where \\ was talking to Ms McCookerybook a few\nweeks ago. She claims to want\nto get away from this sort of\nimage. Rodgers and Hammerstein have a lot to answer for.\nBOOKS\nRoad\nRunners\nWhy is it that no evening\npasses without another yee-ha a a God-damned American\ncar chase on the television?\nWell, that's your problem, not\nmine. Partly because my tele\ndoesn't work, partly because I have a slightly different axe to\ngrind. You see roads, cars and\ngoing nowhere fast are all\nbedded into American writing,\ntoo.\nI suppose the first in the\ntradition would be Twain's Huckleberry Finn \u2014 not strictly a road book, but in\nthose days they did their\nrough travelling by river, so I think it counts. The character\n'Huck' was created as an\ninnocent through whose eyes\nthe author could make wry\nobservations about the Deep\nSouth. Several generic traits\nemerge. The most important\nis that the journey cuts off the\nmain character from his usual\nway of life, giving him time to\nreflect on his past or on\nanything which catches his\neye. This lightens the technical load on the writer. If\nhe were, say in his home town\nand the writer still wanted to\nuse him to observe people, a whole network of personal\nrelationships would need to\nbe constructed. A traveller has\noutsider status, and is easily\npresented as a detached\nsource.\nThe whole structure falls\ninto place. The book starts\nand ends with the journey.\nThe uncertainty of travel, and\nthe endless range of encounters and incidents\nwhich become credible hold\nthe reader's attention with\nease. Of course, the author\nalso gets a chance to strut his\nwidely-travelled man-of-the-world wisdom. Twain has too\nmuch taste to fall into that\ntrap, but later writers are not\nalways so restrained.\nLeast restrained of all is\nJohn Irving. He wrote one\ngood book about two Viennese students touring\nAustria on a motorbike. Not a great book, but a pleasant\none. Setting Free The Bears\nhas an inventive setting:\nperforming bears, circuses,\nunicycles, mysterious women.' Whacky' protagonists, heavy-handed metaphor and a very unusual\ndeath. The snag is that he\nwrote several other books\nwhich draw on the same\nmaterial. The World Acording\nto Garp just about made it,\ndespite the nailed on pseudo-philosophy of the 'under toad'\nand the smart-ass tone of the\nwriting. The others really\naren't worth the trouble.\nRobert M Pirsig used the\nother side of the format \u2014 the\ncutting loose of the central\ncharacter \u2014 to give a lengthy\ndiscourse on the relationship\nbetween science and art is\nZen and the Art of Motorcycle\nMaintenance. Up to the halfway point, there are clever\nideas here. It is rather heavy\ngoing, however, so save it for\nthe holidays. The hippy bits\nabout 'a man's search for his\ninner self can get up your\nnose, too.\nA more complex example is\nKerouac's On The Road. Here,\nthe observer and the central\nfigure are two different\ncharacters, the former regarding the latter with some\nhero-worship. Not enough,\nthough, to hide the fact that\nDean is at root a failure by\nanyone's standards. Desperation and escape drive his\ntravelling.\n'Dean was having his kicks;\nhe put on a jazz record,,\ngrabbed Marylou, held her\ntight, and bounced against\nher with the music. She\nbounced right back. It was a real love dance. Ian\nMacArthur came in with a huge gang. The New York\nweekend began, and lasted\nthree days and three nights.\nGreat gangs got in the\nHudson and swerved in the\nsnowy New York streets from\nparty to party. I brought\nLucille and her sister to the\nbf gg est party. When Lucille\nsaw me with Dean and\nMarylou her face darkened \u2014\nshe sensed the madness they\nput in me.\n'I don't like you when you're\nwith them.'\n'Ah, it's all right, it's just\nkicks. We only live once. We're\nhaving a good time'.\n'No it's sad and I don't like\nif.\nThe feel of crazed escape\nhas been turned to comic\neffect by several writers, not\nleast Dr Hunter S Thompson.\nA good collection of his\nstrange brand of semi journalism can be found in\nThe Great Shark Hunt. Be\nassured that sooner or later\nthe good Doctor will be\nhowling along a freeway in a stolen car, having just\nswallowed an inhuman mix of\nhallucinogenics, whisky and\nspeed. The style can pall if you\nread a lot of it once, but as the\nbook is in short episodes this\nis less of a problem than you\nmight think. Nixon gets a thorough mauling, along with\nmany lesser-known Americans figures. The book predates Regan's Presidency, but\nhe does rate a couple of\namusing side-swipes.\nPenguin publish a quarterly\nlit mag called Grant. It comes\nin the form of a paperback\ncollection of short stories and\nextracts, with a minimum of\ncomment. Issue ten is devoted\nto travel writing, and is well\nworth your attention. This\nbrings us into a slightly wider\nfield of subject matter but the\nworld is a big place.\nOh, inspiration and wide\nopen space.\nSinging...'Born To Be Wild'.\n8 Friday 9 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"
