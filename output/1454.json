His recent talk held by the PPS at Imperial College had a strong turnout.\nProf. David Nutt, Science and Politics\nI\nt is very easy, when you study at\nundergraduate level, to imagine that science has got nothing\nto do with politics, or philoso-phy, or history.\nSo claimed Dr. Stephen Webster,\nDirector of the Science Communication Group at Imperial College, as\nhe opened Imperial College Union\u2019s\nPolitical Philosophy Society\u2019s recent\nevent. The subject of the Interview\nand Question and Answer session,\nProfessor David Nutt, is \u201cemblematic\u201d\nof the ease with which disagreements\narise at the interface between science\nand politics.\nThat the Pippard Lecture Theatre\nwas full to beyond capacity suggests\nthat a proportion of Imperial College\u2019s students are well-aware of at\nleast one current source of friction\nbetween scientists and government.\nIn October last year, Professor Nutt\nwas sacked from his position as chair\nof the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) when he gave\nadvice that was at odds with government policy.\nProfessor Nutt graduated in Medicine from Cambridge University, and\nsubsequently trained as a psychiatrist\nwith an interest in neuropsychophar-macology. A relatively recent arrival\nat Imperial College, he holds the Edmond J Safra chair in Neuropsychopharmacology here. Such a background\nEx AMCD chair Professor David Nutt recently took part in interview and Q&A session at Imperial, Erica Cule\nreports on the event and the Professor\u2019s views on the relationship between Science and Politics.\nmade him the ideal candidate for\nchair of the ACMD, a position he was\nappointed to in January 2008, having\nserved on the council for a number of\nyears before that.\nIn common with Dr. Webster, I\nfirst became aware of Professor Nutt\nin February last year when I read his\narticle \u2018Equasy - An overlooked addiction with implications for the\ncurrent debate on Drug Harms\u2019,\nwhich was published in the Journal of\nPsychopharmacology.\nThis article compares the risks associated with horse riding with those\nassociated with taking ecstasy, and\nreaches some surprising conclusions.\nThe article and its subsequent press\ncoverage ruffled the feathers of the\nthen Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith\nwho requested that he issue an apol-ogy, which he did. The call for his\nresignation in October last year was\nprompted by the publication of a re-port, \u2018Estimating Drug Harms: a\nrisky business\u2019, by the Centre for\nCrime and Justice Studies at Kings\nCollege.\nThe report, itself an edited transcript of a lecture given by Nutt,\ndiscusses the many factors influencing legislation about drugs. In the\nreport, the scale published in The\nLancet in 2007 was presented. This\nscale attempts to parametrize and\nsummarize the risks associated with\nthe use of various drugs, both legal\nand illegal, resulting in a hierarchy\nat odds with current drug legislation.\nKnown for being outspoken, perhaps\nProfessor Nutt felt able to be even\nmore frank because since his sacking\nhe can no longer be chastised by the\nHome Secretary for making his views\npublic whilst holding a government\nadvisory position.\nAt the PPS event, he did not shy\naway from the challenging questions\npresented by Dr. Webster and later\nby the audience. Dr. Webster encouraged this candour, opening by asking him what it felt like to be sacked\nby the Home Office. Professor Nutt\ntouched on the power of e-mail - he\nwas able to communicate his side of\nthe story within hours of his sacking.\nSuch a rapid response is not possible\nfrom a bureaucratic government de-partment. Professor Nutt spoke about\nthe lack of scientific rigour underlying the ACMD\u2019s decisions at the time\nthat he joined, something that appalled him at the time.\nHowever, establishing a system of\nclassification based on relative harms\n(the aforementioned publication in\nThe Lancet) did not win approval\nfrom government ministers when\nclassifying drugs according to their\nharms brought out striking inconsistencies between current drugs legislation surrounding possession and\nsupply. Questions from the audience\ncovered a wide range of topics.\nImperial\u2019s cosmopolitan student\ncommunity were able to point out the\ndifferences in drugs policy in different countries, and to discuss the impact different approaches have on the\nproblems caused by drugs. Professor\nNutt clarified misconceptions about\ndrugs and our current understanding\nof their effects, and carefully pointed\nout where research was lacking, or\ndifficult to conduct.\nHis passion for evidence-based\npolicy-making was clear. Following\nhis sacking, Professor Nutt has not\nretreated from investigating drug\nharms. In January this year he announced the launch of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs\n(ISCD). At the press conference announcing the launch of the new Committee, Professor Nutt outlined its\nplanned remit, to include not just research on drug harms but also their\nbenefits and treatments.\nDrugs are an emotive issue, and,\nin establishing the ISCD, Professor\nNutt hopes to lead an independent\ncommittee once removed from the\ngovernment, that will eventually be\ncommissioned by the government\nto conduct research. Whether this\ncomes to pass will probably not become clear until after the general\nelection. Questions from the floor\nmade it obvious that Professor Nutt\nwas, in this instance, somewhat\npreaching to the converted.\nAs an advocate of the role of scientific evidence in the formation of government policy facing an audience of\nscience students, he was unlikely to\nmeet many dissidents from a political\npoint of view. And when his published\nresearch points out the discrepancy\nbetween evidence of harms and current drug classification, and furthermore leads to the recommendation of\nthe downgrading of some drugs, and\nhis audience are students, he is likely\nto be met with far fewer accusations\nthan he has received from Home Secretaries over the years.\nFor a lively, upfront and honest\ndiscussion of Professor Nutt\u2019s efforts to bring some science to scientific advice, and a demonstration\nof his refusal to march to a political\nbeat, the evening was informal and\nentertaining.\nHowever, I could not help but feel\nthat the debate might have been all\nthe richer if there had been a sprinkling of Daily Mail readers in the au-dience. In this vein, if I may take the\nliberty, on behalf of the PPS I would\nlike to extend an invitation to the\nHome Secretary to face a similar au-dience, some of whom might have an\ninterest in a future career in science,\nor in government, or in both.\n\n"

    "content": "11\nfelix FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\nThe pound may tumble if markets lose faith in British budget deficit plans.\nIs the economy too complex for voters?\nThis week, James Lees discusses the extent to which the state of\nthe economy will effect the upcoming general election.\nI\nt\u2019s the economy, stupid, read\nthe phrase from Bill Clinton\u2019s\ncampaign in 1992. This meant\nthat what wins voters over is\nthe state of the economy above\nalmost all else, and in the upcoming\nBritish general election Bill\u2019s phrase\nwill remain just as true.\nOver the next few months the main\ndebate will be over the scale and\nspeed of the needed cuts to the na-tion's growing budget deficit.\nBritain has just emerged from re-cession, with the last reported figures\nshowing the country limping out of\nthe longest and deepest recession\nsince before WWII.\nWhile the return to growth is certainly good news, the extent to which\nthe economy expanded in the 4th\nquarter of 2009, a mere 0.1%, was\nlower than the 0.4% that had been\npredicted.\nThe government seized on this data\nto proclaim their policies were work-ing, and using the opportunity to\nscore some points against the Tories\nwho had not been supportive of the\ngovernment\u2019s spending plans.\nWhere to go from here is dividing\nthe parties and other commentators\nas well. Labour\u2019s plan is more or less\nmuch of the same, with more borrow-ing, more spending and with a pledge\nto cut the deficit by half over the next\nfew years.\nThis plan has been criticised by 20\neconomics experts in a letter to the\nSunday Times last weekend.\nTheir opinion is that the Treasury\nhas not set out a plan to cut the budget deficit quickly enough. Without\na significant effort to cut the structural deficit, the build up of which\nthey concur was necessary during the\nrecession, now threatens to drag the\ncountry back into recession and completely undermine the recovery.\nPersonally, I am less inclined to\nagree with Labour than with the authors of that letter, who include a\nrange of distinguished academics\nand policy makers. It certainly seems\nto have been the case that quantitative easing and increased government\nspending has helped the economy\nrecover.\nFor this Darling and Brown deserve\nsome credit, but Labour have not\nbeen the amazing financial wizards\nthe Prime Minister is so enthusiastic\nto tell us they have been.\nGordon Brown is likely to go down\nin history as the man who claimed\nthat there would be \u201cno more boom\nand bust\u201d in 1997.\nHe then proceeded to borrow large\namounts of money, promoted the deregulation of the banks and of course\nsold more than half of the nation\u2019s\ngold reserves at an embarrassingly\nbad time\nThis complete lack of financial un-This\nweek\nArgentina steps up\nrow over Falklands\nArgentina has announced new controls\non shipping in its waters\nnear the Falklands after\nprotests over British oil\ndrilling plans fell on deaf\nears. Argentine President, Cristina Fernandez\nhas now signed a decree\nwhich requires all vessels\npassing through Argentinian territorial waters\nor travelling between the islands and Argentina to seek prior\npermission. The Falkland Islands, a British overseas terri-tory, are also claimed by the Argentine government. This\ndispute climaxed in 1982 with the Argentine invasion of the\nFalklands.\nConservative error on\npregnancy rates\nThe BNP scrapped its\nwhites-only membership rule following\na vote held at their\ngeneral meeting. Nick\nGriffin, leader of the\nBNP stated that \u201cwe\nrecognise legal real-ity, so we have done\nit, and now, for one\nthing, they can\u2019t call us\nracist anymore\u201d. The right-wing party was forced to change\nits membership rules following a threat of legal action from\nthe Equality and Human Rights Commission, which Mr Griffin described as a \u201cgovernment funded, tax payer funded\nquango\u201d. The first non white member is likely to be 78 year\nold Mr Singh.\nBNP now accepts\nnon- white members\nThe Conservatives have\nbeen criticised after claiming that the pregnancy\nrate for under 18s in the 10\npoorest areas of England\nwas 54%. The actual figure\nof 5.4% being significantly\nsmaller caused the other\nparties to declare the Tories as out of touch with\nmodern society. While it\nmight seem more likely\nthat it was an unfortunate\nerror from misreading the\nfigures, other Conservative claims of a \u2018Broken Britain\u2019 don\u2019t appear to hold much\nwater either.\n25%\nThe percentage of people I\naksed on the bus who knew\nwhat quantitative easing was,\nall of who planned on voting.\nderstanding meant that the gold was\nsold at over \u00a35bn less than it would be\nworth today.\nOf course it is easy to be knowledgeable with hindsight, and it is far\neasier to criticise than to come up\nwith your own plans. That said even\nat the time of the gold sale it was seen\nby commodities experts as a ridiculous plan.\nIt would seem that Labour are no\nlonger competent enough to run the\ncountry, if they ever were; so the\nquestion arises of whether the Conservatives are. The Conservatives\nhave been pushing for government\nspending to come down for a long\ntime, and they feel vindicated by the\nconclusions of the letter.\nShadow Chancellor George Osborne has said, \u201cCrucially, these\neconomic experts also say there is a\ncompelling case for starting in 2010\nand that there should be independent\noversight of the forecasts - two arguments we Conservatives have been\nmaking with force for months now.\"\nThe agreement between the authors\nand the Tories is not total. The Tories\nare not ruling out tax rises, including\nVAT, which many commentators fear\nmay push the fledgling economy back\ninto recession.\nMainstream ideas of how to sort\nout the country are of course not\nthe only ones. The New Economics\nFoundation, a think tank with socialist leanings, believes that the working\nweek should be cut to 21 hours.\nThe idea is that it would tackle 2\nproblems in 1: unemployment and\nthose who are overworked. Sadly\nfor the lazy this is unlikely to ever\nhappen.\nEmployers spend a large amount of\ntime and money on training people,\nand training twice as many people is\nlikely to prove prohibitively expensive in some industries, for example medicine or nuclear submarine\ncaptaining.\nThe deepest problem the economy\nis likely to face is the general election\nitself. The number of people who will\nvote will massively outweigh those\nwho understand the economy.\nThe stumbling block could easily be\nshort term vote grabbing policies over\nlong term schemes to get the economy back into shape and before long\nthe PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland,\nGreece, Spain) could be the BIG-PIS\nor BI-PIGS.\n\u201cCrucially,\neconomic experts\nsay there is a\ncompelling case for\nstarting [cutting\nthe deficit] in 2010\u201d\n-George Osborne\n0.1%\nThe percentage growth of\nGDPinthelastquarterof2009.\nThis was less than the growth\nof both the EU and the US.\n\n"

    "content": "Hailed as the hooligan of fashion, McQueen was rumoured to have sewn \u2018I\nam a c\u2014t\u2019 into the lining of the jacket\nthat was made for Prince Charles while\nhe worked at Gieves & Hawkes. The\nreputation never subsided.\nHe let his imagination roam wild and\nthe world has since seen stuffed wild\nanimals, real howling wolves and wind\ntunnels on his runways. In many ways\nhe has championed the fashion hall of\nfame by creating the most memorable\nfashion shows. Alexandra Shulman\ncompared going to a McQueen show as\n\u2018the closest you can get to theatre while\nstill being a fashion show.\u2019\nDuring his Givenchy days, he sent\nmodel Shalom Harlow in a white cotton\ndress, puffed with a petticoat, down\nthe runway and spray-painted her using\ntwo car robots.\nAs he graduated into his own label,\nhis shows ventured into a more controversial and extravagant territory. He\nmoved a catwalk into a London swimming lido; projected his runway in\nwrithing cockroaches; had rain poured\ndown on models on the runway; turned\na catwalk into a children\u2019s playground\nand recently a dumpster; replaced models with mannequins...\nAs his shows became more avant-garde, so did his clothes. McQueen\nsaid, \u201cThe show shouldn\u2019t overshadow\nthe clothes and vice-versa.\u201d His designs\ncourted controversy from day one. His\nbreakthrough show in 1996 \u2013 four years\nafter his graduation \u2013 he presented his\nBumster collection with low-rise jeans\nthat exposed the derriere of models,\ncreating a strange proportion and\nadding a new meaning to \u2018cleavage\u2019.\nThis collection took more than \u00a31m\nworldwide. His clothes often juxtapose\nideas governing how style is normally\nconceived. A skeleton as a stole on an\nassymetrical dinner jacket. An antler\nheadgear contradicted by an airy laced\ngown. Majestic Victorian inspired regal\ngowns accessorised with ethnic style...\nThe list goes on.\nMcQueen presented his final wom-enswear collection in Paris, entitled\nPlato\u2019s Atlantis. He was inspired by the\ncoral reefs he saw while he was scuba-diving in Barbados. Models strutted in\n12-inches Armadillo shoes \u2013 the never-before seen shoe silhouette that resembled the body of an armadillo. McQueen told the Spring/Summer issue\nof Love that he doesn\u2019t spend money\non advertisements in fashion maga-zines. The cash flow is directed towards\nrevolutionising fashion shows instead \u2013\nwhich saw his last collection being live-streamed on Nick Knight\u2019s showstudio.\ncom. Millions of visitors flocked to the\nsite and overloaded it. \u2018At the end of the\nday, what people (critics) say doesn\u2019t\nmatter anymore\u2019 as his customers can\nput a verdict on his clothes themselves.\nHis fans include Daphne Guiness,\nCate Blanchett, Sarah Jessica Parker,\nEva Green, Cheryl Cole and more...\nrumoured she went as far as to phone\nMcQueen\u2019s parents to arrange a meeting between the two. McQueen\u2019s success could be in part attributed to Blow\nas she used her status as a famous stylist\nand a magazine editor to pull strings for\nMcQueen when he first started out.\nMcQueen had retained close ties\nwith his mother, Joyce, until her death\n2 weeks ago. In 2004, Joyce interviewed\nMcQueen for G2, a supplement of the\nGuardian newspaper. She asked him:\n\u2018What is your most terrifying fear?\u2019, to\nwhich he replied: \u2018Dying before you.\u2019\nShe said: \u2018Thank you, son.\u2019 McQueen\u2019s\nAW10 collection entitled Horn of Plenty\nwas dedicated to her.\nThe death of his mother caused McQueen to spiral into depression, as his\nfinal tweets seem to reveal. Two days\nbefore his death on the 10th Feb he\ntweeted, \u2018Sunday evening been an F\u2014-g\nawful week but my friends have been\ngreat, but now I have to some how pull\nmyself together and finish with the\u2026\u2019\nMcQueen hanged himself in the\n23\nfelix FRIDAY 19 FEBUARY 2010\nFASHION\nFashion Editor\nFashion Editor Kawai Wong\nKawai Wong\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLong Live the Queen \u2013 A Tribute to Lee McQueen\nCalling McQueen a legend is definitely an understatement. Kawai Wong and Renny Norman recapped the life\nof the super talented fashion visionary Lee McQueen, who passed away on the 11th Feburary, 2010.\nLee Alexander McQueen grew up in\nEast London, the son of a taxi driver\nand one of six children of a family that\nsuffered many financial difficulties.\nMcQueen often made dresses for his\nsisters.\nHe was openly gay and said that\nhe \u201cwent straight from [his] mother\u2019s\nwomb onto the gay parade\u201d, claiming\nto have realised at age six. He came out\nto his parents at age 18. He unofficially\nmarried his lover, George Forsyth in\n2000 on a yacht in Ibiza with Kate Moss\nas his bridesmaid. The pair separated\nsoon afterwards. In the aftermath of\nthis he has been known to have had a\nrelationship with a porn star nicknamed\n\u201cMr Stag\u201d and an Australian who left\nhim to return to Australia.\nMcQueen\u2019s close friend Isabella Blow\nhas been following McQueen\u2019s career\nsince before he graduated from Central St Martins. Failing to get a seat at\nhis graduate collection show she went\non to purchase his collection in full in\norder to show her admiration. It was\nMcQueen left school at 16 with a single O-Level in art and immediately began an apprenticeship with a tailor on\nSavile Row. He then applied to work as\na pattern cutter tutor at CSM in 1994.\nDue to the strength of his portfolio he\nwas persuaded by a professor to enrol in an MA course and graduated in\n1992.\nHis graduate collection was bought\nin its entirety for \u00a35000 by the influential stylist Isabella Blow. The clothes\nwere delivered to her in refuse sacks.\nShe bought one thing a month from\nMcQueen when his career first started\nand paid him \u00a3100 a week. The friendship forged between the two remained\nuntil Isabella took her own life in 2007,\nafter having been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

He went on to\nwin the award three more times until\n2003. He was also awarded a CBE for\ncontribution to fashion.\nThere is intense speculation regarding the label\u2019s future.

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk BUSINESS\n9\nfelix\nBUSINESS\nLeft to right: Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises was first discovered the \u2018Austrian\u2019 theory of business cycles; F.A. Hayek, the ideological rival of Keynes, developed von Mises\u2019s theory - for this he\nshared the 1974 Nobel Prize in Economics; Tom Woods (pictured above) is one of many economists in the Misesian tradition who warned of the 2008 crises. Peter Schiff is another famous example.\n*\nSO WHY DOES ANY OF THIS\nMATTER?\nMoney itself is not wealth; it is the potential to claim wealth. When people\nborrow money from the bank, they\nexpect to be able to use it to purchase\nreal things. When there is more money in existence than there are things\nto buy with it, prices have to go up\naccordingly. Most people do not earn\nenough money to compensate for\nthis. This is because the prices of real\ngoods and services do not all rise at\nthe same time.\nThe first people to use the new money - the government and its agencies -can spend it before this causes prices\nto rise. Therefore inflation is a tax, just\nlike any other. But because it is more\ndifficult to see and easier to get away\nwith, it is subject to nowhere near as\nmuch scrutiny as other taxes.\nThe problem with this is that the\ngovernment can spend its proceeds on\npolicies that would not be otherwise\nacceptable. For example, the recent\nwar in Iraq would probably not have\nhappened if every American family\nwas asked to pay $15,000 up-front. Yet\nthis is what it cost, as calculated by the\nnotable economist Joseph Stiglitz.\nAlso, inflationism plays particular\nhavoc with investors and entrepre-neurs, who calculate their business\ndecisions based on false information\nconcerning the amount of real wealth\navailable. The result is a boom in borrowing and investment in new ven-tures, and a corresponding boom in\ndebt created at the same time.\nBut the laws of economics do not\nallow this situation to be sustainable.\nThere comes a point where the debt\ncannot be supported by the productive\ncapability of an economy and through\ncompound interest it grows out of\ncontrol. There comes a point where\nthe people who have borrowed and invested realise that they\u2019ve obtained less\nreal wealth for their efforts than they\nhad been led to believe. A collapse\nensues.\nNote that it is not necessary for investors to be ignorant in order to fall\nprey to this trap. Even if you know that\ndebt levels are unsustainable, if you\nwork for an investment fund or bank\nyou may well fear losing your job if you\npull out of certain markets even as they\nare rapidly growing.\nAs the system unravels, money that\nwas created by loans through fractional reserves is demanded back, which\ncauses insolvency problems for the\nbanks as they only deposit a fraction of\nwhat they owe. At the same time, they\nrecover only a fraction of what they are\nowed. Banking regulation and money\nprinting are the most direct forms of\nState interference in finance. The argument for the former is that some\nunregulated banks will fail, causing\nirrational savers to lose confidence in\nall banks. Apparently market forces do\nnot apply.\nIronically, both problems are massively exasperated by the implicit\npromise of State bail-out as well as the\nperceived homogeneity of an entire\nindustry regulated to exactly the same\nstandards.\nof an unsustainable asset bubble is\nthat its price will rise in terms of gold\nbeyond fundamental justification. But\nthis is only the beginning of the story.\nThe Austrian School of economics\nhas a long and distinguished history\nof being right on key debates, including business cycles.\nIf you have found any of the ideas\ndiscussed in this article interesting,\nyou are in luck. The website of the\nworld\u2019s leading institute of Austrian\neconomics, mises.org, has further re-cources on all economic topics. It is\nall available online for free.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average is shown in terms of gold grams. The first peak is the Great Depression. The next peak\nwas caused by the strains of the Vietnam War and LBJ\u2019s \u2018Great Society\u2019 reforms. The latest one is the biggest of all.\n*\nPREDICTING THE NEXT RECESSION\nAs we have seen, recessions are\nmainly caused by excessive money\nprinting. So how can we tell when this\nhas happened?\nFor at least the last 4000 years,\ngold has the commodity standard of\nchoice. Even today, it still remains the\nbest available approximation to a free\nmarket in money. The reason for this\nis that its supply can grow only very\nslowly.\nTherefore a good early warning sign\n\u201c...both problems\nare massively\nexasperated by the\nimplicit promise of\nState bail-out\u201d\n\u201cWhen there is\nmore money in\nexistence than\nthere are things to\nbuy with it, prices\nhave to go up \u201d\n\n"

This is an\narticle to keep in your bedside drawer\nnext to your problem sheets and dust-Suspended peat\nSenator\nPestering Plebian\nAncient Cash\nmachine\nThe earliest pavements date back to\nAncient Greece, where slabs of dried\npeat were suspended on sticks, allowing the senators to commute to work\nfrom their leafy Athenian suburbs.\nThe concept was to walk on the underside of the peat and avoid the pestering\nhomeless plebians, camping outside\nearly Ancient Greek cash points.\nDespite early successes, the pavements proved to be inefficient, owing\nto the overwhelming effects of gravity,\nwhich was yet to be discovered.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1687 when Newton famously dropped his child off a bridge\nand observed the lack of his return that\ngravity was discovered and pavement\ntechnology leapt forward in advances\nIn 1845, Tony Pave took the lead in\nrevolutionising the paedestrinisation\nof the British capital and introduced\nthe first \u2018pavement\u2019 outside Buckingham Palace, allowing Queen Victoria\nto walk to Marks and Spencers without\nbeing run over by a horse and cart.\nHowever, Jeffery sidewalk, an American civil engineer, accused Tony Pave\nof stealing his invention and took him\nto court. The ten year-long feud resulted in fourteen civilian casualties and\nthe assassination of US president Lincoln.

The glossy surface is the mark\nof funding cuts by the local council.\nWith the lowest walkability index allowed by regulation, this really was the\nmost unenjoyable stroll in the UK.\nThis may look like rubble, but is in\nactual fact the artwork of the 1960\u2019s\nSwedish NewWave pavement designer,\nOskar Brauner. Hangman loves this\nrelic of the Sixites, embodying the\ncarefree attitude of the era. Potholes\nand cracks are an artistic interpretation of human nature.

Bob Krebs,\nHead Chief of Asphalt Innovations,\nspoke to us about how 2010 will be an\nexciting year for roads:\nHangman: Hey there Bobby, we hear\n2010 will be an exciting year for roads,\nis this true?\nBob: Yes.\nHangman: Excellent, thanks for your\ntime Bobkins.\nWe also spoke to a leading official in\nthe field of Concrete Forensics who\nreassured us that the British singer,\nAdele, has been drastically misinformed about tectonic pavement\nshifts. \u201cPavements move a maximum\nof 20 cm a year.

Firstly, you don\u2019t need a spoon\nto eat a biscuit and secondly, food is\nsimple. You either like it or you don\u2019t.\nYou know that whenever you try a\nnew meat, it will always taste a bit like\nchicken. Drink, on the other hand, is\nmore complicated. It flows, it\u2019s ever-changing, it won\u2019t bloody sit still. A\ndrink is never just a drink.\nWater, for example. Chemically, it\u2019s\nas simple as you can get. Oxygen, hy-drogen, a few double bonds and you\u2019re\nsorted. But that\u2019s not the whole story.\nWithout it, life is impossible, but too\nmuch and life starts having serious\nsecond thoughts...unless you\u2019re a fish.\nIt\u2019s free in any pub, bar or club yet the\nbottled water market is worth \u00a350 million a year. Everything goes into it and\nit goes into everything. You can even\nget a taste for a place from their wa-ter. Back home, the water in Cardiff\nis friendly, easy-going and just a bit\nfruity...just like the people. Here, in big\nbad London, the water is strong, stiff\nand tough on the liver. Pregnant women are advised to avoid London water\nand I\u2019ve heard that the Thames is the\nonly river that can be ploughed. Seems\nlike a lot of fuss over some oxygen and\nhydrogen.\nThrow in some carbon and mix\nthings up and you\u2019ve got alcohol, ethanol in particular, and suddenly things\nget even more complicated. Contrary\nto all objective evidence, it runs thicker than blood or water in the bonds\nof fellowship. It\u2019s a drink of initiation,\nof commiseration, of congratulation,\nand manifold other purposes. If you\ndon\u2019t believe me, visit the Reynolds on\na Wednesday night and watch as the\nfloors run red with Snakebite (and other fluids). I can still remember my first\nday at Imperial, the respect that radiated from my peers as I funnelled away\neverything they had to contribute. That\nfeat would have been nowhere near as\nimpressive if I\u2019d downed Diet Cokes\nand J20s instead.\nBut no matter how legendary your\nactions towards alcohol, they can\u2019t\ncompare to the magic of alcohol\u2019s actions on you. After a few dances with\nSe\u00f1orita Tequila, I become a different\nperson; affable yet clumsy, and gifted\nwith an encyclopedic knowledge of\nWelsh culture and history (wait, how\nis that different?). But that\u2019s the great\nand terrible thing about alcohol. People act more true to themselves while\nsloshed, pissed and rat-arsed. If you\nfind walking in a straight line while\ngazeboed difficult, do you really think\nyou have the cohesive cognitive ability to present a false fa\u00e7ade to the\nworld? Any and all masquerades subtly dissolve into that ubiquitous social\nsolvent over the course of a night. Of\ncourse, for every infinitely friendly\ndrunk, there is a lusty, fighty half-cut\nlout. It\u2019s not exactly a glowing endorsement of humanity but hey, cheers!\nThemagicalcoholcanworkonsomeone is indeed impressive but it pales in\ncomparison to the otherworldly powers of that prince of beverages, tea.\nNo matter how bad things get, a cup\nof tea can always make things better.\nAnd how does it do that? The universe\ndoesn\u2019t suddenly contort into some\nfancy origami of a new reality. The rent\nwill still be overdue, those exams will\nstill happen next week, and I guarantee\nit will still be raining...but after a cup\nof tea; milk, two sugars and perhaps a\ncheeky chocolate digestive, everything\nwill seem better. As a scientist, the only\nrational explanation I can find is...it\u2019s\nmagic. Simple as that. Even its origin\nis somewhat otherworldly. The ancient\nChinese emperor, Shennong, was sitting peacefully in his garden with a cup\nof boiling water (and I won\u2019t deny that\nthat is delicious) when some camellia\nleaves drifted into his drink, like a gift\nfrom the gods. And maybe that\u2019s what\nit is, a gift. A gift for when life crowds\nin, when it all piles up and everything\nseems too much. Sometimes, in those\nawkward moments, when there are no\nwords to say, you can say it best with a\nsimple cup of tea.\nThey say that, after all the evils of\nthe world had escaped, the last thing\nto leave Pandora\u2019s box was hope \u2013 is it\npossible that the box Pandora opened\nwas a box of PG Tips?\nRhys Davies can down drinks all day long\n\u201cNo matter how\nbad things get,\na cup of tea can\nalways make it\nbetter\u201d\nL\naziness has become an integral part of any university\nstudent\u2019s life. It is one of the\nmost important trademarks\nof a student, placing it on a\npar with excessive drinking, partying\nand self-inflicted sleep deprivation. It is\na unique phenomenon only shared by\nthose who have experienced it and can\ntherefore appreciate its artistic beauty.\nIn fact it is so sophisticated that there\nshould be an entire academic branch\ndevoted to studying this incredible\noccurrence. Ok, maybe too much but\nthroughout my time at university I\nhave noticed many unusual and peculiar quirks which have arisen purely due\nfor the sake of saving effort.\nEffort, time and money: the holy trinity of a student\u2019s life. Less effort spent\non working and passing the exams\nmeans more time available for \u201cthings\nother than work\u201d. In fact this notion\ncan be simplified even further to an\nequation (keeping to the Imperial style)\n\u201cless effort = more time\u201d. More time for\nwhat? The answer to that is unknown\nand not even necessary. In fact the idea\nof \u201cless effort\u201d is so dominant in a student\u2019s brain that it overrides any sense\nand reason that is left and it stimulates\nstudents to find ever more ingenious\nways of saving effort, even if it is at the\nexpense of time. A friend of mine, who\nwishes to remain anonymous in fear of\nthe media furore that will arise from\nher Nobel Prize-worthy solution of\nsaving effort, epitomises the concept of\nminimising effort by choosing to take\nthe District rather than the Piccadilly\nLine from South Kensington station\npurely because \u201cthere are fewer stairs\nto walk\u201d. Despite the fact that the journey may even take longer, in the end,\n\u201cless effort\u201d rules the day.\nHaving dealt with one side of the\nequation, the other side is equally fas-cinating. Having obtained more time,\nthere is the question of how to use the\ntime. I normally idealise my thinking\nand convince myself that time saved\nmeans that there is more time for studying and working. Unfortunately, the\ntruth is the time is used on procrastina-tion, yet another hallmark of a university student\u2019s life.\nIn a world where the internet is so\naccessible, there are countless distractions to immerse yourself in, even if the\nFacebook/YouTube axis of evil is taken\nout. I recently witnessed a series of\nevents that again embodies the plethora of \u201cprocrastinatible-material\u201d available on the web. Somehow, research on\ninjuries of the spine lead to 30 minutes\nspent on an internet ten-pin bowling game (If anyone is interested, the\nsequence goes: spine injuries-can be\ncaused by bowling-google bowling-bowling game). Taking a second glance\nat it, none of this makes any reasonable\nsense: in the world of high-end graphics and computers, there are countless\ngames available which are far superior to some internet bowling game; if\nworktime does not transcribe to work\nsurely it would be wise to spend that\ntime with friends or eating. Such is the\nnature of procrastination!\nWhat is worse is that the more you\nprocrastinate, the more regret you feel\nin not doing any work, thus leading\nto more extreme measures into saving time thus leading to more time for\nprocrastination. I myself am victim to\nthis as well. In fact when I typed \u201cFacebook/Youtube axis of evil\u201d I did an obligatory check on Facebook. In the end,\nthe extra time obtained is again wasted\non doing nothing worthy, except maybe thinking of more ingenious ways of\nsaving effort!\nI have probably exaggerated the\nwhole aura surrounding the very simple task of not doing anything at all,\nespecially with the ridiculous amounts\nof hyperbole used. However I do think\nit is very intriguing how students can\ncome up with ways to be lazy most of\nthe time, considering the fact that the\nage of an undergraduate is probably the\nage of optimal physical fitness. It is an\nart form and I think it deserves some\nappreciation, even if it is for the absurd\ntechniques for minimising effort.\nWrite for Comment! Make your voice heard. Or, rather, read. Like this. Only, this is white on red.\n\n"

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLord Winston has bad ideas coming\nThis Monday evening, over 80 students and staff members of Imperial\nCollege, together with members of the\nlocal Jewish community, gathered to\nhear Professor Lord Robert Winston.\nLord Winston spoke about his new\nbook \u201cBad Ideas\u201d, due to be published\nthe 18th February. In this unique and\ntimely book, he takes a fresh look at\nman\u2019s greatest discoveries and innovations and asks whether our dependence on science and technology has\nled us into a precarious situation which\nis doomed to become worse before it\ngets better? As well as tracing the history and fall-out of our very worst ide-as, this book also advocates the merits\nof scientific progress. For, our drive to\ninvent and improve the world around\nus is what, after all, makes us human.\nMany Imperial students were\npresent, as well as students from\nvarious nearby colleges. Mark Harris\nstudying maths at IC said, \u201cI was very\ninterested in his subject matter, and\nhis examples were all thought provok-ing, and presented in a way I had never\nthought of before\u201d.\nProfessor Winston discussed the\nbasic human fear of change, and the\nfear of new science and technology. To\ncite an example, he went as far back as\nthe early days of writing. Interestingly,\npeople back then reacted with fear,\nburning books and other forms of writing in large public displays, because\nwriting transmitted sacred knowledge\nwhich should be kept, and not dissemi-nated; or it transmitted knowledge that\ndidn\u2019t suit the current powers that be.\nToday, for the most part, we see writing as a good thing.\nGovernments often use and misuse science and technology with key\ndecisions being made by a select few\npeople. Professor Winston advocated\neducating the public, so that they\ncould be informed and involved in key\ndecisions which would perhaps help in\nharnessing the rapid advancements of\nmodern science and technology. Professor Winston connected the \u2018drive to\ninvent\u2019 to the first biblical commandment in Genesis (1:18), \u201cbe fruitful and\nmultiply, fill the world and conquer it\u201d.\nHe explained the term \u201cconquer it\u201d as\nmeaning to take control of science and\nharness the innovations that humans\ncome up with and use them for positive things.\n\u201cThe talk was thought provoking\nand well received, both by scientists\nand non-scientists,\u201d Rabbi Mendy\nLoewenthal, director of Chabad of\nSouth Kensington said. Adam Szerenyi, an undergraduate in finance\nat Budapest University commented,\n\u201che brought scientific concepts to\na level that made them universally\nunderstandable\u201d.\nDavidHarrington\nDavidHarrington\nImperial has launched its first international PhDs in partnership with three\nAsian institutions: University of Hong\nKong, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, also in Singapore.\nStudents who apply for the joint PhD\n(across all the subjects offered at Imperial) will have to be accepted by both\nImperial and their Asian counterpart\nand will divide their time equally between the two institutions.\nTheir PhD will also be jointly assessed in a joint viva at the end of the\ncourse.\nProfessor Mary Ritter, Pro Rector of International Affairs said that\nstudents taking part in the joint PhD\nprogramme \u201cwill have the chance to\nbecome part of a network of leading\nresearchers in two world centres of scientific excellence, launching them into\na globe-spanning career.\u201d\nThe venture is also aimed at strength-ing Imperial\u2019s links with other research groups. Acting Rector Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions said: \u201cIf we\u2019re really going to\ntackle major challenges like climate\nchange, sustainable energy and global\nhealth, the world needs science to be\noutward looking and collaborative.\u201d\nThere are fears that such projects\ndilute the prestige of the more famous\npartner, in this case Imperial College.\nHowever, Hong Kong University and\nUniversity of Singapore are amongst\nAsia\u2019s premier academic institutions.\nImperial goes PhD\ninternational\nChabad - Lubavitch (UK) has long\nbeen active on university campuses in\nLondon, including IC, with classes\nand social programmes. In 2008, the\nactivities expanded to include a full\ntime Chabad House in South Kensington, serving the needs of Jewish\nstudents and other locals.\nChabad of South Kensington is part\nof a pioneering Jewish network of\nsome 4,000 Chabad-Lubavitch centres in more than 50 countries around\nthe world.\nWinston connected the\n\u2018drive to invent\u2019 to the first\nbiblical commandment in\nGenesis (1:18), \u201cbe fruitful\nand multiply, fill the world\nand conquer it\u201d.\nApplications are invited for the position of\nHALL SENIOR\nin\nSOUTHWELL HALL\nSouthwell Hall is one of four halls of residence located around Evelyn\nGardens, just off Fulham Road in South Kensington.

Yes,\nI may be from the Home Counties and a bit soft but sub zero\ntemperatures just aren\u2019t right\nunless it is snowing and you don\u2019t have\nto go to college. Many a day I have\nbeen tempted to skip the exercise of\nusing of my microscooter and to hop\non the bus. Although this is not so\ntempting now that Albert Bridge is\nclosed and everyone living South of\nLondon uses my road as some sort of\nCentral London bypass. So whilst it\u2019s\nso bitter, Saturdays are now concerned\nwith working my way through a vast\nDVD collection and getting better acquainted with my duvet. As the eponymous musicals fan I like to get hold of\nfilmed productions- the rarer the bet-ter. So far I\u2019ve enjoyed a production of\nSondheim\u2019s Company where the actors\nplayed the instruments, Boy George\u2019s\nmusical Taboo and Sunday in the Park\nwith George, again by Sondheim, starring Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette\nPeters.\nIf musicals aren\u2019t your bag, never\nfear! There is still plenty of culture that\ncan be enjoyed from the warmth of a\nbed. Try catching a classic play like A\nStreetcar Named Desire or The Crucible on DVD, or indulge in some Shakespeare and a cup of hot chocolate. For\nthe art lovers among you, many galleries have online collections that you can\nperuse at your leisure, plus enhanced\nfeatures that make you feel less guilty\nfor not venturing out in the cold.\nBut there is one thing that you have\nto venture out for, Artsfest. This is the\nbig celebration of everything artistic\nand cultural at Imperial.\nTaking place next week, each day\nwill be filled with concerts, perform-ances, workshops and exhibition with\nthe main event, the Artsfest Showcase on Thursday in the Great Hall. I\nthink I\u2019m performing in that, better go\ncheck...\nBroadway Royalty\nComing Through...\nLucy Harrold talks to Stephanie J. Block about her upcoming concert\nSnuggling up\nto Culture\nLucyHarrold\nLucyHarrold\nM\nost of you will probably never have heard\nof Stephanie J Block,\nbut to those of you\nwho have, the news\nof her first solo outing in London is a\nbig deal. On Broadway she is a leading lady with an amazing voice, having appeared alongside Hugh Jackman\nin \u2018The Boy from Oz\u2019, held her own\nas Judy Bernly in \u20189 to 5 The Musical\u2019\nand originating the role of Elphaba in\nworkshop productions of \u2018Wicked\u2019.\nFollowing a successful appearance\nin Scott Alan\u2019s \u2018Just Me...And Them\u2019,\nSimG productions have brought her\nback for her very own concert at the\nNew Player\u2019s Theatre which looks\nset to be an awesome concert I got\nto speak to Stephanie in preparation\nfor this concert and I must say I was\nbloody excited to speaking to someone\nof such high calibre on the Broadway\nscene!\nHow did your concert at the New\nPlayer\u2019s Theatre come about? How\ndo you find the intimate concert in\ncomparison to a huge stage?\nI performed in London late last year\nwith Scott Alan. Simon Greiff produced Scott\u2019s concert and it was beautifully presented, with a lot of care and\nclass. Simon asked if I would be interested in bringing my solo concert to\nthe West End and I was thrilled! There\nis something really special about performing in an intimate setting as one\u2019s\nself. I began performing in jazz clubs\nin NYC in 2004 and found that I absolutely loved it. It\u2019s a vulnerable position\nto be in... standing alone on stage sharing your personal stories and favourite\nmusic. But it is highly gratifying.\nWhat do you have planned for the\nconcert? Any special surprises?\nI am not going to tell you my set list...\nYou must attend the concert to know\nthe music. But, yes, there will be some\nsurprises.\nI saw you in Scott Alan\u2019s \u201cJust Me\u2026\nand Them\u201d concert last year, how\ndid it feel to be making your London\ndebut? And how do you feel London\naudiences compare to Broadway\naudiences?\nI was extremely nervous coming to\nperform in London, but I had the buffer of Scott Alan. I know how much he\nis loved over there. And that helped to\nsettle my nerves. I found a very warm\nwelcome when I stepped onstage and I\ncan only hope that happens this time\naround.\nI never expect any particular response from any audience whether it\nbe a regional, Broadway or a London\ncrowd. You have to earn an audience\u2019s\nappreciation, respect and response. I\nplan on \u201cearning it\u201d on the Feb. 28th.\nThis is your second trip to London,\nwhat do you enjoy most about London and if you ever get to just be a\ntourist, where are your favourite\nplaces to go?\nThe last time around, I did have some\ntime to be a tourist. I did a little Christmas shopping in Notting Hill. I saw the\nNational Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cWar\nHorse\u201d... incredible! And I was able to\nspend time with some dear friends.\nThis trip I will be taking a day to give\na master class at MTA. Then there will\nbe rehearsals with the band and guest\nvocalists (Annalene Beechey, Oliver\nTompsett and, just recently onboard,\nHadley Fraser... sensational artists\nin their own right. I am so lucky and\ngrateful to be able to share this experience with them). And then, of course,\nthe two concerts on Sunday. So I won\u2019t\nbe able to play in London as much as I\nwould have liked. But, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll enjoy a pint or two.\nWould you like to appear on the\nWest End?\nYES! I would love to appear in a show\non the West End. However, I am a wife\nand a mother (to a 4 lb. puppy). So I\ncan\u2019t just pack my bags and commit to\na West End contract. Beyond the joy of\ntheatre there is life. My family and life\nwill always be my first priority. As the\ncharacter Fanny Brice says in Funny\nGirl, \u201cYou can\u2019t take an audience home\nwith you.\u201d\nWould you like to do more album\nbased work and who would be your\ndream duet?\nI would love to do more recording.\nThe beauty and the struggle of record-ing, though, lies in the process. With\nthis place I knew, I was not only the\nartist but also the executive producer.\nI made sure every decision fell to me. It\nwas exhausting but a true labor of love.\nSo, that is the question I now ask my-self. Do I have the energy, finances and\ninspiration to produce another album?\nIt would really have to be a theme and\nline-up of songs that filled me with\ngreat passion. I am always thinking of\nwhat\u2019s next. As far as my \u201cdream duet\u201d,\nI have many. I would love to sing with\nMs. Streisand. To share a song with\nJames Taylor would be the ultimate.\nHis voice, his vibe, his musicianship;\nSimG Productions are offering\nstudent tickets for \u00a320, just\nphone 0207 478 0135 and quote\n\u201cstudent offer\u201d\nFor more information, visit\nwww.SimGProductions.com\nStephanie J. Block in Concert is playing at the New Players Theatre on Sunday\n28th February at 6pm and 8.30pm.\nit would be heaven. And of course, I\nalways love singing with my husband,\nSebastian Arcelus.\nYou\u2019ve starred in shows alongside\nthe likes of Hugh Jackman and Alison Janney, do you ever get star-struck? And who would you get starstruck if you met them?\nI was not star struck with Hugh or Allison because they were so laid back,\nwelcoming and excited to get to work.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I always felt blessed and extremely lucky to work along\nside them. But you don\u2019t want your\nco-star to think they are going to be\nworking with... a fan rather than a peer.\nThey are actors. They love what they\ndo. And they are counting on their\nfellow cast members to do their best\nwork in order to create with them.\nIf I was to become stage-struck, it\nwould be in the presence of Barbara\nStreisand, Julie Andrews, and Carol\nBurnett.\nYou\u2019ve worked with some of the best\nsongwriters in the business, whose\nwork have you enjoyed performing\nand is there anyone you would love\nto work with?\nWell, I can\u2019t answer who\u2019s music I\u2019ve\nenjoyed most. Every songs evokes a\ndifferent emotion, a different story and\nyou just can\u2019t rank them in an order.\nThat\u2019s the genius of art. It\u2019s not black\nand white, 1-2-3, right or wrong. I do\nhave several composers I would still\nlove to work with. Stephen Sondheim\ntops my list, as well as John Kander. I\nadore the music of Adam Guettel and\nwould find it a glorious challenge to\nsing one of his scores. I guess that\u2019s the\ngoal... to be inspired and challenged.\nThese 3 composers certainly do that\nfor me.\nAs the original Elphaba in the Wicked workshops, how do you feel about\nthe show\u2019s impact on the theatre\nworld?\nI am sooo proud to have been a part of\nWICKED\u2019s initial workshops, the original company, the first Nat\u2019l tour and\nthe Broadway company. I\u2019ve shared an\n8 year relationship with Wicked and\nI am truly honored. I knew from the\nmoment I read the first script that it\nwould be a remarkable piece of theatre.\nThe music was magical. The script was\npowerful and clever. And the creative\nteam/production team had an amazing\npedigree. It all added up to equal great\nsuccess. I will forever have a deep connection to the role of Elphaba.\nWhat would your dream role be?\nFanny Brice in funny girl..\nWhat has been the most rewarding\npart you\u2019ve played and why?\nEvery role brings great reward and\ngreat heartache. As an artist, one invests so much time, love, tears, hard\nwork in creating a role. You truly fall\nin love with the character you been\nbringing to \u201clife\u201d. I have learned so\nmuch from each experience that it all\nhas lead me to be the performer I am\ntoday. That\u2019s the reward... that you\nlearn from each character, each chal-lenge, each success and each flop.\nCan you give us any clues about what\nThe beauty and\nthe struggle of\nrecording, though,\nlies in the process.\nyou\u2019re up to next?\nThey are a few irons in the fire but until a contract is signed, it doesn\u2019t exist.\nArts Editor\n\n"

Teased and tricked by the ee-rie, otherworldly witches and goaded\non by his devious wife, Macbeth yields\nto his dark ambitions to become the\nking. Once on the throne, he ruthlessly\nsees off real and imagined threats to\nhis royal claim. But the murder and\nbetrayal take their toll as both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are plagued by\nghosts and inner demons.\nMacbeth is the third major production for ICSM Drama this year. Hopes\nare high that it will follow on from the\nsuccesses of the Freshers\u2019 Plays and\nArsenic and Old Lace in the Autumn\nterm, while at the same time moving\naway from comedy to more serious\ndrama.\nShakespeare has a long history at\nImperial but this has been largely due\nto productions by IC Dramsoc, their\nlast being Much Ado About Nothing\nlast summer. In the past, ICSM Drama\nhave tended to shy away from the bard\u2019s\nwork. Some members have quailed at\nthe thought of putting on Shakespeare\nand more importantly, doing it justice,\nwhile others have shunned it in favour\nof more contemporary works.\nTaking a bold step then into the director\u2019s shoes are Paul Fairhurst and\nSe-yi Hong. Turning a centuries old\ntext into a living, breathing play is no\neasy task but as they say, a burden\nshared is a burden halved. Some might\nargue that having two directors can\nonly hurt a play as no one artistic vision can come to the fore. However,\nthat is definitely not the case here as\neach director plays to their respective\nstrengths. Paul Fairhurst is firmly in\ncharge of the dramatic side of things,\ncoaching the actors on their stresses\nand guiding them through the unfamiliar language, while Se-yi Hong\nmasterminds the choreography of the\nproduction. Between them, they make\nsure that everyone can talk the talk and\nwalk the walk.\nTogether, they have laboured to\npresent this seventeenth century piece\nin a new way for a new audience.\nWithin the play, there are themes of\nandrogyny and confusion which the\ndirectors choose to highlight with\nsome surprises in the casting. The\nparts of the witches are to be played by\nmale actors while the murderers have\nbeen cast as women. They have also\ndecided to go back to basics in terms\nof wardrobe and scenery. Rather than\nget swept away by elaborate backdrops\nand meticulously accurate costumes,\nthe play will be performed on a largely\nbare stage, as so not to distract from\nthe power of the bard\u2019s blank verse.\nThis is not simply a cheap attempt\nat lowering production costs but seeks\nto highlight and underscore the emotive themes of the play. The result is\na coruscating production not to be\nmissed. It promises to be accessible\nto all; a faithful adaptation for those\nwell-versed in Shakespeare, while not\nbeing over-familiar, but also an exciting and novel production for those\npreviously turned off by fussy, dusty\nEnglish teachers, and those that have\nnever been turned on at all. You don\u2019t\nhave to look too hard to see the diversity of those involved. ICSM Drama\nregulars rub shoulders in the cast list\nwith the freshest of freshers, some of\nwhom only cut their acting teeth in the\nyear\u2019s earlier productions. But despite\nthe differences in age and experience,\nthe cast are dedicated to the production and the hard work they, and everyone in backstage and tech, have all\nput in since January, and will continue\nto put in until late into the night of Friday 5th March. So next week, why not\ncome along? You might think that you\nhad put Shakespeare behind you with\nGCSE English but a tale filled with\nmurder, betrayal and naked ambition\nwill never go out of style.\nAmnesty Imperial make sense of the trajic situation in Darfur\nT\nhough conflict in Sudan\nhas been ongoing since its\nindependence from Britain in 1956, it wasn\u2019t until\nviolence escalated in Sudan\u2019s region of Darfur that it started to\nreceive worldwide coverage. Human\nrights organisations such as Amnesty\nInternational started to raise awareness of the conflict, publishing reports\nand demanding UN intervention for\nthe region. Colin Powell, when he was\nsecretary of state in the US, called the\nconflict in Darfur genocide, though\nAmnesty International prefers to avoid\nsuch terms - there is no doubt that\nmassive human rights atrocities were\noccurring.\nSudan is a country composed of\nmany different ethnic groups, with\nthe north being mainly dominated by\nMuslim Arabs and the South being\ndominated with black Africans. There\nhave been two civil wars since Sudan\ngained independence from Britain, the\nlast one ended in 2005 with the deaths\nof 2 million people. The war started off\nas a conflict between North and South\nthough as time went on and the Arabian National Congress Party took power in 1989 for the southern Sudanese,\nit became a war over resources and the\nfreedom to be allowed to follow their\nindividual religious beliefs.\nOne of the worst conflicts began\nin 2003 when the government tried\nto squash an uprising in the region\nof Darfur. It armed and supported a\ngroup of Arab militias called the Janjaweed to target rebel villages. As a\nresult, at least thirty thousand people\nwere killed, thousands of villages were\ndestroyed, people were raped and tens\nof thousands were displaced. To bring\nan end to the many conflicts, in 2005\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement\n(CPA) was made between the different groups giving the South semi-au-tonomy for six years and drawing up\nthe framework to resolve many of the\n\u201cStars, hide your\nfires. Let not light\nsee my black and\ndark desires.\u201d\ncauses of the conflicts.\nThis framework was to be put in\nplace by 2011 and included support\nfor the division of oil revenues and a\nNational Land Commission to negotiate the division of land between different groups. However as yet violence\ncontinues in Darfur and most of the\nframework to be put in place as part of\nthe CPA has been delayed.\nIt can be difficult to fully appreciate\nthe situation in Sudan when newspapers and news programs only every\nfew weeks briefly mention that a few\nmore villages have been burnt and a\nfew more people have been killed. Often it can seem that it is just another\npart of the \u201cAfrican problem\u201d, one of\nthose problems which since it isn\u2019t going to go away anytime soon is best\nignored. However in less than a year\nfrom now, a solution to this problem\nmay be in grasp. As arranged in the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement, the\nreferendum which will allow Southern\nSudanese people to decide for themselves whether they wish to stay as part\nof Sudan is going ahead.\nIn the last few weeks, thousands of\nactivists have been gathering around\nthe world to mark the five year anniversary of the Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement (CPA) and to call for urgent steps to be taken to secure peace\nin Sudan including:\n\u2022 Increasing the UN peace\nkeeping force (UNMIS) in Sudan to reinforce the protection of civilians and\nso that its personnel can be deployed\nswiftly to areas of conflict.\n\u2022 Increasing the amount of\ndiplomatic support to the Northern\nand Southern Sudanese parties so that\nthey can resolve the issues of wealth\nsharing, borders, and security\n\u2022 Provide intensive support\nfor the legislation for the referendum\nwhich is taking place next year, and\nincrease international monitoring of\nhuman right violations occurring in\nSudan in the run up to the referendum.\nAmnesty Imperial has been doing its\nown campaigning to raise awareness\non the situation in Sudan. Two weeks\nago, one of our members gave a talk\nhighlighting the genocide in Darfur\nand the next event planned is going\nto highlight the conflict in Sudan all\naround campus.\nThe society will be marching around\ncampus as part of the Sudan365 cam-paign, organised by a group of people\nwhich are encouraging people everywhere to drum for Sudan and submit\na video. Sudan365 was formed on the\n10th of January 2010: 365 days before\nSouthern Sudanese people will be given a referendum.\nSince many famous drummers such\nas Stewart Copeland of The Police and\nNick Mason of Pink Floyd are involved\nin the campaign, the group decided\nthat drumming for peace would be its\ntagline.\nIt is hoped that by raising awareness\nmore pressure will be put on governments to unite and give support to the\nreferendum, which will hopefully bring\nan end to the conflict and peace for Sudan. Hopefully the campaign by Imperial Amnesty will heighten awareness\naround campus lending more support\nfor Sudan in this crucial time period.\n\u2018The result is a coruscating production;\nfaithful and accessible to all.\u2019\n\u2018One of the worst\nconflicts began in\n2003 when the government tried to\nquash uprising in the\nregion of Darfur.\u2019\n\u2018The society will be\nmarching around\ncampus as part of\nthe Sudan365 campaign.\u2019\nPlenty of fake blood to be bought by the ICSM Drama society\n\n"

In the first semi-final,\nthe Kick 4 Life team comfortably saw\noff a depleted Southside Legends team\nand began to eye the title.\nThe second semi-final was much\ntighter with Ahmed\u2019s Mediterranean\nMagicians and the Wilson Kings battling it out. It was scrappy and there\nwere few chances but the winner came\nout of nothing as Sam Rickards drove\na left foot shot into the corner to help\neke out the victory. The stage was set\nfor an epic final. The Kick 4 Life team\ncoasted to the final, while the Kings\nhad to fight their way through every\nstage. However the Wilson Kings made\nsure that the result was never in doubt,\nracing into a 4 goal lead by half time.\nTheir slick passing game had reached\nits peak and no team could have lived\nwith them.\nThere was a modicum of fight\nleft in the Kick 4 Life team as they\nscraped back a couple of goals but\nthe Kings were just too good, running\nout 5-2 winners and crowned the inaugural Imperial College Kick 4 Life\nchampions.\nI would like to think the tournament\nwas a success, mainly to all the help I\nreceived in organising. So I would like\nto thank all the players, in particular\nthe Captains, who helped me out enor-mously, thanks to Sim Anandajeyarajah for helping out with the finances,\nthe photographer Jon Gordon, Ed\nLobb for his support, the staff at Ethos\nfor generously donating playing time\nbut mostly to the Co-Founder of Kick\n4 Life, Steve Fleming, for helping me\nthrough the process and for running\nan amazing project.\nContinued from back page\nCharity fundraiser helps out HIV victims in Southern Africa\nImperial Eagles\u2019 unbeaten run ended by Warwick\nStefan Bauer Handball\nWhile the international competitions\ndon\u2019t seem to be that close and interesting anymore, which I have to blame\nthe French for, the lower leagues still\nseem to have an edge to them. Imperial\u2019s first ever league game in the autumn was against Warwick and, despite a clear loss, gave the team hope\nfor the rest of the season. They worked\nhard and what followed was complete\ndomination over local rival UCL and\nOxford University, which put the Eagles in a position where they would still\nbe able to fight for the top spot in the\ncompetition and enter the play-offs if\nthey were to beat their nemesis.\nThe Warwick line up was similar to\nthe one from the autumn game, which\nmade their tactics predictable. If Imperial wanted to claim the two league\npoints for themselves, they would have\nto find a way to condemn the big German shooter in the back row and stop\nthe playmaker from setting up the\npivot in attack, who was also of considerable size. On the other side of the\ncourt the experienced and admittedly\nfrightening central Europeans were always going to make it more difficult to\npass the middle block with individual\nactions than in our previous games,\nwhich meant that, finally, there would\nbe a suitable opportunity to try some\nof the new and well planned schemes\nlike \u201cWurst\u201d and \u201cDagmar\u201d.\nTypically, the Eagles failed to implement any of the tactical masterpieces\nthat would have changed the flow of\nthe first half. Either they spoiled all\ntheir good attacking work by leaving\nmassive gaps in defence or wasted all\ntheir defensive efforts in attack by conceding avoidable turnovers, which lead\nto a 5-goal lead for the guests at half\ntime.\nConsequently, the half-time talk was\nsimple and merely a repetition of what\nwas said before the game, but even a\nteam that cleverly named one of their\nattacking schemes after the German\nword for sausage and shouts French\nphrases revolving around sheep at\neach other for motivation, needs to regroup and realign once in a while.\nAt the start of the second half, the\ngame took a new turn. Imperial defended well and attacked smartly,\nstretching the guests\u2019 defence with\nsmooth combinations to set up the\nshooters on the wing. In addition to\nthat, the Eagles\u2019 goalkeeper finally figured out the complex shooting pattern\nof the Warwick team, which cleverly\nalternated between \u2018throw\u2019 and \u2018throw\nharder\u2019, and made the shooter look like\na delusional, arthritic West-German\ntrying to tear down the Berlin Wall by\nthrowing marbles at it.\nWith only 7 minutes to go Imperial\nhad a 2-goal lead, which was well deserved at that time, but Warwick came\nback strong and showed why they are\nleading the league. Their defence got\nmore aggressive and IC was lacking the\nroutine to bring home the advantage.\nIn some rather hectic closing seconds,\nWarwick converted a final counter attack that would take the game past\nImperial.\nAll in all it was a very frustrating loss\nto suffer and a massive blow to the Eagles\u2019 title hopes, but a necessary lesson\nhas been learned and, hopefully, the\nhard work and fine performances over\nthe season will be crowned with silverware at the University Championships\nin Manchester next weekend.\nI\nIm\nIm\nImpe\npe\npe i\nri\nri\nri l\nal\nal\nal C\nC\nC\nC l\nol\nol\noll\nle\nle\nlege\nge\nge E\nE\nE\nEag\nag\nagl\nle\nle\nles\ns\ns 20\n20\n20\nWa\nWarw\nrwic\nick\nk Un\nUniv\niver\nersi\nsity\nty 22\n22\nIt\u2019s that time of the year again...\nVarsity is on its way, and felix\nwill be covering all the action\nin a very special edition.\nWant to stoke up the rivalry?

It\u2019s high\ntime we all went back to paying with paper money, or\nperhaps even doubloons. They\u2019re both\nprobably safer than the current electronic system we have in the UK, the\ninfamous \u2018Chip-and-PIN\u2019. Last week,\neminent security researcher Ross Anderson and his team published a paper\nidentifying a huge security flaw in the\nsystem that governs all of our real-life\ncredit and debit card transactions. The\ntake home message of the paper was\nthat our cards are not, and have never\nbeen, as secure as we all thought.\nBefore our current system, bank\ncards carried just the magnetic stripe\nthat stored the account details of the\ncard. Cashiers would swipe the card\nand ask for a signature from the cus-tomer, which would then be compared\nto one written on the back of the card.\nIt meant the decision of whether or not\nthe signatures matched was up to the\ncashier. This system worked pretty well\nfor the customer, except for the fact it\nwas pretty open to fraud from forging\nof signatures or card cloning of stolen\ncards on which new signatures could\nbe written. Chip-and-PIN was devised\nas the security mechanism that took\nthe discretion out of the hands of the\ncashier and made the whole system\nelectronic. Cards now include a chip\nthat authenticates the transaction using a PIN known only to the user,\nwhich is entered into a card terminal\nwhen paying. The idea was that this\nwould make stolen cards worthless\nwhilst also removing any liability from\nthe cashiers and by extension their\nemployers.\nThe whole authentication process is\nactually quite complicated, with data\nand numbers being transferred up and\ndown and all over the place, but the\nimportant part happens when you actually type in your PIN.\nThe PIN is punched into the terminal\u2019s keypad and sent to the card. The\ncard then decides if the PIN is correct\nand sends the appropriate message\nback to the terminal. The security flaw\narises due to the fact that this conversation between the card and the terminal keypad is not encrypted. A piece of\nelectronics in the middle can intercept\nthe PIN entered on the terminal and\nsimply return a \u2018yes\u2019 message which\nlooks as if it originated from the card,\nregardless of whether the PIN was correct or not. The card never even receives the PIN and eventually just assumes something went wrong and that\nthe authentication was carried out successfully by some other method, like\nthe good old signature check. Neither\nthe card, the terminal or even the bank\nhas enough information about the\ntransaction to detect the subterfuge.\nSo where does this leave us con-sumers? Well, Chip-and-PIN was also\ndesigned as a system to help protect\nbanks, shifting all of the liability for\nunauthorised purchases onto the card-holder. If the system worked securely\nthis arrangement would be fine and it\nprobably is the consumer\u2019s fault if they\nlet someone else know their PIN. Now\nthis security hole has been unveiled it\nmeans that thieves have a means to use\nstolen cards and therefore the card-holder genuinely isn\u2019t to blame. Banks\ncan and do hide behind the fact that\npurchases are supposedly \u2018verified by\nPIN\u2019, with at least one court case using this as evidence of consumer neg-ligence. This weakness brought to light\nby Anderson and his team, however,\nsuggests that this might not always be\nthe cause. Unfortunately for consum-ers, until this hole gets patched, which\nwill take a very, very long time, or the\njustice system wakes up to the fact\nthat Chip-and-PIN is broken, there is\nvery little protection for card-wielding\nconsumers.\nWhat can you do to protect your-self? Very little, apart from vigilance\nat the terminal and ATM. Check the\ncard slot for any foreign devices such\nas skimmers and make sure the terminal doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s been tampered\nwith before you stick your card in it.\nWatch those statements kids.\nT\nhis week has seen the annual\nMobile World Congress take\nplace in Barcelona. MWC\nis THE place where mobile\ndevice manufactures come to show off\ntheir latest wares and where journalists\nflock to attempt to chart what we can\nall expect for the mobile year.\nThis year Microsoft stole the show\nwith what can only be described as\na mobile resurgence with Windows\nPhone 7. OK, so Windows Mobile/\nPhone 6 and 6.5 run quite a lot of\nphones out there, but it\u2019s been a dead\nduck for the last two years. With competition from Android, the iPhone, the\never-present RIM and Palm\u2019s webOS,\nit was about time Microsoft brought\nthemselves into the modern smartphone game.\nWindows Phone 7 series represents a\nserious paradigm shift from Microsoft.\nNot only is it based on Windows CE6,\nlike the Zune HD, but they\u2019ve completely rewritten their UI playbook.\nGone is the reliance of a stylus to get\nthings done, the humble finger reigns\nsupreme, as it should. In fact, Windows\nPhone 7 is so drastically different from\nits predecessors and any other phone\noperating system out there at the mo-ment, it\u2019s pretty hard to describe.\nMicrosoft calls its interface \u2018Metro\u2019\nand it is essentially like a Zune interface\nblown up and extended. Drawing more\nfrom its Zune and Media Centre experience than Windows, Metro is heavily\nreliant on motion and typographic elements forged in a high contrast, minimalist UI. Gone is any degree of alpha\nshading, bevels or modern accents that\nApple and co, insist on splashing everything with. That\u2019s not to say Microsoft\u2019s \u2018chromeless\u2019 design lacks polish,\nbut it\u2019s a simplified plain interface that\nreally suits the small screen.\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week, another tech\nstory and there\u2019s plenty of them\nto choose from this week, so\nlet\u2019s get cracking, OK?\nFirst up for your gadget\ngorging pleasure is the world\u2019s\nfirst 4G netbook. The Samsung N150 packs your usual\nnetbook fare, nothing really\nto shake a stick at apart from\nthe LTE modem (that\u2019s LongTermEvolution\nfor those keeping\ntrack). Boasting potential\nspeeds of\n100Mbps\ndown/50Mbps up, real world\ntests showed Sammy managing roughly 28Mbps which, to\nbe fair, is faster than my home\nbroadband. A lot to get excited\nabout then.\nPerhaps even more remarkable than superfast mobile\nbroadband was the \u2018super\u2019\nAMOLED display Samsung\nhad in its first Bada (don\u2019t ask)\nphone the Wave. Although the\nphone itself is a bit snooze-tas-tic the screen really did prove\nto be super, showing bright,\nvivid and fully saturated colour\nin bright sunshine, something\nordinary AMOLED screens\njust can\u2019t manage. With all\nthe benefits of OLED screens,\nemitting their own light,\nthus saving power and giving\namazing vibrancy plus\noutdoors readability, I\nreally hope Samsung\nand others stick this\namazing display in\nsomething a bit more\nexciting!\nMore phone news\nfrom MWC in Barcelona this week from a\nrather unlikely part-nership, Puma and\nSagem. The ChavPhone, err, I mean the\nPuma Phone, features a\ncapacitive touchscreen, 3.2MP\ncamera with LED flash, GPS, a\ncompass and a pedometer for\nsporty types. What makes this\nlittle beggar a little different\nfrom the rest is the solar cell\nit\u2019s packing on its back for on-the-go green charging.\nImpressive little guy,\nbut I for one couldn\u2019t\nseriously consider\nbuying something\nphone-like with\nPuma branded across\nit. Look for it throughout Europe this April.\nRIM finally joined\nthe modern world\nthis week with a WebKit-based browser\nfor Blackberry. Finally\nBlackberry addicts will\nhave a fast, efficient mobile\nbrowser that doesn\u2019t suck. Will\nthis make you buy a Blackberry? Probably not, but it\nwill make accessing the web a\nmuch less tiresome affair. Hats\noff RIM, that didn\u2019t take long;\nonly 3 years or so.\nWired was in the news again\nthis week with more iPad related talk. This time it had a fully\nrendered demo of\nits digital magazine format\nwhich it hopes\nto launch on\nthe iPad come\nMarch. Interestingly, the\ndigital magazine Wired created was wrapped up in Adobe\nAir meaning it should be a\nquick port to the iPhone/iPad,\nif Apple approves it, of course.\nThe big question is, will punters pay for something they can\nnormally get free online? Perhaps not, but only time will tell.\nThe ISS this week got its\nnew window, Cupola, bolted\nonto the Tranquillity module.\nAs you can see, courtesy of\nGizmodo, it presents\npretty impressive\nviews of Earth and\neven looks like\na Tie Fighter to\nboot. Awesome.\nBad news for\nAdobe this week\nas a recent report\nindicates malicious\nPDF documents made up 80%\nof all computer exploits in\n2009. It seems Adobe Reader\nhas become the new mass-market target for malware.\nDoesn\u2019t bode well for students\nand researchers where the PDF\njournal article reigns supreme.\nSamuel\nSamuel\nGibbs\nGibbs\nTechnology\nEditor\nReturn of the\nWindows Phone\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nThe Start screen holds rows of tiles\ndown the middle which are live and\nanimated with ones that are used more\noften promoted to the top. The list of\ntiles can be infinitely long and scrolled\ndown with a swipe.\nStatus updates and things like that\ncan be pushed to the tile allowing\nyou to see them at a glance of the\nanimation.\nMicrosoft has also fleshed out the\n\u2018hub\u2019, something that will be familiar\nto Zune HD users. Hubs offer a middle\nground between icons and a full blown\napplication. A hub is an extension of\nthe OS which can carry content in from\nboth local or cloud sources, meaning\nphoto galleries can be browsed right\nfrom a hub.\nThink of them as a way to pull information into the OS without having\nto have a separate app running. Microsoft showed off a variety of hubs\nat MWC2010 including a People hub\nwhich pulls in contact information and\nstatus updates from social networks,\ncontact databases such as Gmail\u2019s\ncontacts and of course Exchange. The\nsmart thing about the hub is that the\nfirst screen you see is a dynamically\ngenerated screen with the people you\ncontact most right in front of you and\na section for \u2018Me\u2019 which allows you to\nupdate your status across multiple net-works. Other hubs featured included\nGames with Xbox Live support, the\nMarketplace, aka App Store, Music\nand Video for all your media, Pictures,\nOffice and the usual calendar, mes-sages, email, phone, Bing Maps and\nSearch, and of course IE mobile.\nAn impressive turn around for Microsoft indeed, but how it actually performs in the hand remains to be seen.\nI for one am excited to see Microsoft\nback in the game, it\u2019s been a while.\nplus\nI\nng\nis\nn\ne\ns\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\nth\nI\ni\no\nt\nth\nK\nfor\nTermEvo\nfor thos\ntrack).\ning\nsp\n\n"

According to Tony\nMontana, \u2018In this\ncountry, you gotta\nmake the money\nfirst. Then when you get the money\nyou get the power\u2019. This seems pretty\nsimple, but what defines power? The\nway I see things, there\u2019s an underestimated power in music. Not in the conventional way of being powerful, but\nin an indirect way that can feed on the\nsubconscious of the mind and influence the actions of huge amounts of\npeople. Speaking in terms of decades,\na winter\u2019s morning of 1960 hailed Elvis\nPresley as number 1. The King of Rock\nand Roll, Presley stood for the rebels,\nthe breakaways and the nonconform-ists. This alone is a nice fact, but he\nwas shortly followed by The Beatles in\n\u201863 and their music of love and peace,\nlater progressing to number 1\u2019s from\nthe Rolling Stones and The Kinks, all\nof this music having themes in peace,\nlove, against war and anger - everything the hippy movement stood for.\nCoincidence? Definitely not, but what\ninfluenced what?\nThis relationship of music and culture is true for many key points in his-tory, music having influence over the\nend of wars and political decisions, the\nWoodstock Festival being one of the\nmost famous cases of this. Going back\nto before records were around, tribes\nand cultures across the globe had numerous chants and songs for happenings such as going to war. In some\ncases, the music was even taken into\nbattle in the form of drummers. The\nintention of this music was to build up\nthe anger, aggression and drive for the\nwarriors to kill and defeat their enemy.\nTo say this music had no influence on\ntheir minds is clearly not true.\nMusic is something that should be\nfeared for its power over people, the\npower it deserves. Take punk music as\nan example: I may be slightly biased for\nmy love of punk, but I\u2019m no anarchist.\nA strange thing happens when I listen\nto The Sex Pistols or The Clash; I feel\nthe energy of anarchy and the thoughts\nof punk music to fuck the system. The\namount of passion put in when making\na recording of this type, in a way, leaks\nout through the music and through osmosis can manifest itself in the listener.\nIf somebody has gone through the\npain and love of making a song, whatever the genre, I think it deserves to be\nheard, which is why I listen to such a\nrange of music. The gangsters on the\nstreets relate to the music which completes them, which is why they may not\nunderstand their wrongdoings. I\u2019m not\nsaying that there should be restrictions\non music in any way, because for me\nthat would be a crime, but I am saying that it\u2019s an underestimated force.\nMusic has the power to inspire people.\nInspire people to love, to hate, to save\nor even to kill; so, know that you\u2019re listening to a powerful force and be sure\nyou don\u2019t always do what they tell you.\nLuke Turner\nLuke Turner Music Editor\nT\nhe man, the wonder, Stevie Wonder is still alive and\nkicking, so much so that\nhe\u2019s taken the headline\nspot at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival. I have to feel sorry for\nStevie when I think about him headlining Glastonbury. I know it\u2019s hard to\nfeel sorry for anyone who\u2019s successful\nenough to play in front of 150,000 peo-ple, but he won\u2019t be seeing any of them\nyet smelling all of them. Then again,\nit\u2019s an honour.\nStevie Wonder went blind just after birth in 1950 and has gone on to\nbecome the iconic sound of soul and\nfunk across the world, winning countless awards including the Gershwin\nLifetime Achievement Award and the\nhighest number of Grammy awards for\na solo artist.\nNot only is he such a musical phe-nomenon, he is also currently an\nactivist for civil rights and in 2009\nwas named UN Messenger of Peace.\nBarack Obama is quoted about his\nmusical heroes, \u201cIf I had one it would\nhave to be Stevie Wonder. When I was\njust at the point where you start getting involved in music, Stevie Wonder\nhad that run. Those are as brilliant a\nset of five albums as we\u2019ve ever seen\u201d.\nSo Stevie will take front and centre\nthis June on the Pyramid Stage, with\nU2 and Muse being the other two\nheadline acts. It\u2019s set to blow your\nmind.\nIf there\u2019s anybody for a young musician to look up to, it would have to be\nStevie Wonder. His courage and drive\nto carry on with his blindness, his\nsongs that stand for everything good\nand just the fact that everything he\ntouches not only turns to gold, makes\nyou feel so damn good.\n-Luke Turner\n10\nNumber of instruments that\nStevie Wonder has played\non various recordings.\n1950\nThe year Stevie Wonder\nwent blind. Also being\nthe year he was born.\n22\nThe number of Grammy\nawards Stevie Wonder\nhas won throughout his\ncareer... And still counting.\n10\nWas how old Stevie Wonder\nwas when he wrote his first\nsong, of many to come.\nWhat gorgeous teeth\nTINIE TEMPAH\nPASS OUT\nDL RECORDS\nSINGLE\nHighlights include the way he says\n\u201cBonjour\u201d, \u201cScunthorpe\u201d, the satisfy-ingly catchy hook and funny break\ndown towards the end. Just a tad hard\nto relate to lyrically, although after lis-tening, I totally want to quit uni and\nbecome a rapper.\n-Lily Le\nRaw sounds and an emo touch, You Me\nat Six are keeping it basic. Nothing out\nof the ordinary but these blasting guitar chords with limited riffs have got\nsome serious power with some catchy\nvocals; I was surprisedly impressed.\n-Luke Turner\nLADY GAGA\nTELEPHONE\nINTERSCOPE\nSINGLE\nYes, Gaga is back with her irritating\nhabit of getting a song stuck in your\nhead and this is no exception. With\nBeyonce featuring alongside her, Gaga\ntells us of her telephone and the calls\nshe recieves and makes, and we all can\u2019t\nwait to hear about them... Or not. Even\nso, it will stick with you. -Luke Turner\nYOU ME AT SIX\nHOLD ME\nDOWN\nVIRGIN\nRECORDS\nALBUM\nVIV ALBERTINE\nEP\nMANIMAL\nVINYL.\nEP\nJASON DERULO\nIN MY HEAD\nWARNER BROS\nSINGLE\nTHE\nAUTOMATIC\nTEAR THE\nSIGNS DOWN\nARMOURED\nALBUM\nThe Automatic are coming back for a\nsecond round and it was always going\nto be hard. This album is full of crunching guitars and merry vocals. It is as\nwell-mixed as pancake batter on Pancake Day and has smart staccato riffs.\nIt does however begin to sound all the\nsame towards the end. -Luke Turner\nIf you\u2019re pretty French girls with guitars,\nnobody gives a shit what you release,\nbecause everyone in the world wants to\nfuck you and you know it. So go ahead\nand tell us how much of a bitch you are\nand even patronise us by spelling it out.\nNous vous aimons. -Lily Le\nELLIE\nGOULDING\nSTARRY EYED\nPOLYDOR\nSINGLE\nHype always gets backlash which I was\nhoping to be part of for Goulding, but\nher single turns out to be quite difficult\nto hate. It\u2019s basically a few minutes of\nlots of beats, beeps and some electronic shizz with some wonked-up vocals,\nbut simple things please simple minds.\n-Lily Le\nTHE\nPLASTISCINES\nBITCH\nNYLON\nRECORDS\nALBUM\nA twenty-something young girl, with a\nfender and the skills to rock out. This\nsingle is fun-loving light rock with raw\nguitar which has had the evil hand of\noverproduction cast upon it. Tiffany\nPage, I hope, will give us more gentle\nrock this year. - Luke Turner\nTIFFANY PAGE\nWALK AWAY\nSLOW\nMERCURY\nSINGLE\nTHE BUTTERFLY\nEXPLOSION\nLOST TRAILS\nREVIVE\nRECORDS\nALBUM\nButterfly Explosion are basically really\nslow indie rock, so either slow The Big\nPink down a bit or speed up Snow Patrol\nand you\u2019ve got The Butterfly Explosion.\nThe album doesn\u2019t move very much, it\nsticks on the same not-very-interesting\nsound all the way -Kadhim Shubber\nNothing good about this song. The\nsound is a rip-off of \u201cJust Dance\u201d by\nLady Gaga, the lyrics are a rip-off of every RnB song since Usher\u2019s \u201cYou Make\nMe Wanna\u201d and the video is a rip-off\nof Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cLike I Love You\u201d.\nSummary: shit. -Kadhim Shubber\nViv Albertine used to be the guitarist\nfor punk band The Slits. Which means\nthat her songs sound really good\n(they\u2019re not punk btw, they\u2019re mellow\nand poppy) but the lyrics are just\nabysmal. If you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t\nlisten to the lyrics of a song then you\u2019ll\nenjoy this. - Kadhim Shubber\n\n"

You would be correct, so if you\ndon\u2019t like it I\u2019ll get Kanye West to come\nover there and give you a Taylor Swift\nstyle beat down, whatever the f*ck that\nis.

Tell him I sent you.\nUnfortunately I\u2019ve been too busy to\nhave time to reach the levels of anger\nyour used to. I ran the Hyde Park Relays, and like any self-respecting drinker would, I ran ludicrously slowly and\nalmost vomited at the end.

Previous to coming to university I didn\u2019t\nknow that there could be that much\npipe in the world. Apparently, I\u2019m told\nthere is.

    "content": "4 felix FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS\nAs no doubt many of you are already\naware, Imperial College Union is having a face lift. Phase 3 of the redevelopment is well under way, with many\nthanks to our Union President, Ashley Brown, and Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services), Danny Hill, among\nothers.\nAfter Phases 1 and 2 of the union re-development, which saw the rehousing\nof the Student Activities Centre (SAC)\nand the Union offices into the main\nunion building, creating a mezzanine\nlevel and freeing up the Beit Quad\nEast Basement to allow it to be used as\nstorage and additional meeting rooms\nfor clubs and societies, we\u2019re now seeing the beginning of Phase 3.\nPhase 3 involves the refurbishment\nof the ground floor of the main union\nbuilding, including the two bars. The\ndesign for the bars has almost been\nfinalised, amid controversy over what\nto do about a certain pillar in dB\u2019s.\nImperial College Union is nothing\nwithout its students, so they\u2019ve asked\nfor your input into the designing and,\nmore importantly, the renaming of\nTensions between Lord Mandelson\nand the academic community have\nbeen rising ever since his then Department for Business was given control of\nhigher education, to become the Department for Business, Innovation and\nSkills. Many complained that this was\na blatant move in the direction of com-mercialising academia. The situation\nhas been considerably worsened by the\ngovernment\u2019s all-round budget cuts,\ndesigned to appease voters alarmed\nby the record deficit ahead of general\nelections in May.\nAt a lecture at Nottingham University last week, Lord Mandelson argued\nthat academics were wrong to feel singled out, \u201cmuch of the rest of the public\nsector will receive similar constraints\nin the course of this year or soon after...\nthe appearance that universities are in\nthe frontline of public spending cuts is\nan illusion created by that need to plan\nahead. I have always said that higher\neducation would have to bear its share\nof public spending cuts, but not more.\nPublic funding cuts are the regrettable\ncost to the UK of saving the banking\nsector and getting the country through\nthe recession.\u201d\nA \u00a31 billion reduction in the higher\neducation budget has been announced\nfor next year. He claimed that academics \u201cthink they have a right to be set\nin aspic in what they do,\u201d arguing that\nwhen they complain about the budget\ncuts, what they are really concerned\nwith is dealing with change. \u201cThey are\nusing the argument about spending reductions as a screen or a cloak behind\nSina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian which resistance to any sort of change\nand reform can be conducted.\u201d\nFrom the common experience of university academics, this sounds more\nplausible than the Russell Group\u2019s\nwarning that the cuts could \u201cbring\nuniversities to their knees within six\nmonths.\u201d However, the cuts may be especially damaging as last year\u2019s record\nof 570,000 undergraduate applicants is\nexpected to rise by one fifth.\nLord Mandelson also reiterated his\nearlier advocacy of two-year intensive\nlearning bachelors\u2019 degrees, describing it as something that \u201cneeds to happen anyway.\u201d It is also likely to save the\ngovernment billions in higher education spending. He also reaffirmed the\ngovernment\u2019s commitment to ensuring\nthat not everyone has access to higher\neducation, \u201cit makes no sense, either\nin terms of the cost to the public purse\nor the provision of quality teaching,\nwhich remains critical to the credibility of higher education.\n\u201cA large-scale, untargeted further\nexpansion of full-time three-year de-grees, without any real attention to\nwhat these additional students are\nstudying, or how well it equips them\nfor life at work, also makes no sense\nat a time when we need to be focusing more closely on strategic skills and\nalternatives to full-time study.\u201d Mandelson encouraged students who fail\nto get into university to instead \u201ctake\nup apprenticeships.\u201d The government\u2019s\nencouragement of all children to aim\nfor university places has aggravated the\noffence felt over these comments.\nLord Mandelson\u2019s statements come\nas the think tank Policy Exchange published a study last week arguing for\nhigher tuition fees as a source of additional funding for universities. One\nof the report\u2019s authors said, \u201cif we want\nto retain Britain\u2019s position as a global leader in higher education, we are\nconvinced that fees will need to rise...\n[higher fees are] vital, if we are to have\na fair system in which institutions that\nserve students well are rewarded\u201d. The\nreport has been criticised for putting\nstudents from poorer backgrounds\noff applying for the most prestigious\nuniversities, which would be the most\nlikely to raise their fees.\nOn a positive note, the government\nis planning a transfer of funding from\n\u201cdegrees\u201d to degrees in science, technology and medicine. Dr Richard\nPike, chief executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d\ncourses such as celebrity journalism,\ndrama combined with waste manage-ment, and international football business management \u2013 all of which exist\n\u2013 should be \u201ckicked into touch\u201d.\nUniversities are now waiting for an\nindependent commission chaired by\nLord Brown to report back after the\ngeneral elections. It is expected to recommend raising fees to \u00a37000 per year.\nThis will not apply to existing students,\nor those starting next year. It may advantage existing students and graduates by reducing new applicants, which\ncould tackle \u2018grade inflation.\u2019 This is the\nphenomenon of graduate salaries going\ndown because of the rise in the supply\nof graduates, seen particularly in the\nlast decade. It has already tightened\nthe graduate premium \u2013 the difference\nbetween average life-time earnings of\ngradates and non-graduates \u2013 by over\n70% in this time, to below \u00a3200,000.\nBar names\nshortlists\nannounced\nthe bars on the ground floor of the\nunion building. dB\u2019s will no longer\nbe called dB\u2019s and Da Vinci\u2019s will no\nlonger be called Da Vinci\u2019s. The Union have asked you to email in a few\nsuggestions of what you think they\nshould be renamed to.\nOver the last couple of weeks, people have been emailing in their ide-as; sending in all kinds of weird and\nwonderful names for the bars. We\nhad over 150 different suggestions\nsent in by students, from the typical\nImperial geeky ones, such as \u2018Pi\u2019 and\n\u2018Dark Matter\u2019; to the downright weird\n\u2018Smarties\u2019 and \u2018Gash\u2019.\nAfter much deliberation, those 150\nsuggestions have been whittled down\nto a shortlist (see below).\nIt\u2019s time for more input from Imperial students. Now that the shortlist\nhas been decided, you can go to fe-lixonline.co.uk from today and vote\nfor your favourite name for each of\nthe bars. The poll will be online until\nThursday 25th February at noon, so\nyou\u2019ll have to hurry up if you want to\nhave your say!\nDon\u2019t forget you can keep up with\nthe Phase 3 developments on the union website.\nCharlotteMorris\nCharlotteMorris\nMandelson criticises academics\namongst impending cuts\nLord Mandelson peers into the abyss that the higher education cuts have left in universities\u2019 budgets\nThe blizzard-effect decor for the new nightclub might not last long\nHave your say!\nVote online from today at felixonline.co.uk\nShortlist for\nnew nightclub:\n1.

The two ICU Snooker\nteams met a little after 7 am for the\ntrain to the gloriously dull town of\nCoventry. Saturday offered a mixed\nbag of results: In the Individual Championship, Imperial\u2019s number one and\nfirst team captain, Sam Dennis, found\nhimself in a London derby against\nLSE\u2019s top player, Aqeel Qadri. After\nlosing the first frame convincingly,\nSam, with the help of a 44 break, was\nable to come back and win 2-1 with a\nround of applause from the spectators.\nMoving through to the next round,\nhe faced York 1\u2019s Matt Robson, whom\nhe beat two years ago en route to the fi-nal. This year, however, saw the luck of\nthe balls running completely in favour\nof his opponent; this, teamed with a\npoor miss on a vital pink in the deciding frame, saw Sam prematurely crashing out of the event.\nImperial\u2019s Hari Arora also made it\nthrough his first match, beating Manchester 1\u2019s Nick Clayton 2\u20130 before\nlosing to Mike Walsh of York 1, run-ner-up in last year\u2019s BUCS Snooker\nChampionships, by the same score.\nThe other members of our first team,\nKwan Ng, Duc Tien and Lawrence\nWild, failed to progress beyond their\nfirst matches, choosing instead to \u201cfocus their attention on the team event\u201d.\nOur second team had more success\nin the Individual Trophy with three of\nthe five players making it through to\nthe quarter-finals. These were newbies to the team, Amish Patel and Nigel Rozario, along with club veteran\nLewis Guan. Grace Yip, renowned for\nher incredibly long matches, became\nthe first ever female to win a match at\nthe Midlands Cup, beating Cardiff 2\u2019s\nNoah Reynolds 2\u20131 before a 2\u20131 loss\nto York 3\u2019s John Fox. Second team captain Will Duncan, renowned for dressing as a pirate, lost in straight frames to\nKeiran Baxter of Cardiff 2.\nPutting their disappointment in the\nindividual tournaments aside, the team\nevents kicked off with the second team\nplaying a 15-frame match against York\n2 in the Team Trophy. Will opted to\nplay last in the running order in the\nhope that the match would be won by\nthe time he had to play, or as he stated,\n\u201cto win the deciding frames if needed\u201d.\nUnfortunately, the team found themselves 8\u20134 down\u2014all losing tight\nmatches two frames to one\u2014by the\ntime Will got a game, so even with his\n2\u20131 victory against George Hogg, the\nteam lost 9\u20136.\nIn the Team Championship, our first\nteam seemed to catch the unluckiness\nthat Sam experienced in the individual\nevent, and with two draws and three\nlosses, we lost 8\u20132 in our opening ten-frame match against Cardiff 1. Slightly\ndeflated, we moved to our second\ngroup match against Oxford 1. Once\nagain, Lady Luck was unkind to us and\ndespite a 2\u20130 victory against Joe Sturge\nfor Sam, in which he achieved the sec-ond-highest break of the tournament\nwith 45, the team lost 6\u20134.\nSaturday night, we felt we needed a\nlittle pick-me-up after our poor per-formances, so we waded into an all-you-can-eat Indian/Chinese/Thai buffet where we polished off a few jugs of\nKingfisher and had a little too much\nfun with the ice cream factory and\nchocolate fountain. Morale restored!\nSunday began at breakfast with our\nslightly eccentric bed and breakfast\nowner. Hearing stories of our misfor-tune, he disappeared through to the\nkitchen to see if he could \u201cfind us some\nluck\u201d! A few confused looks later, he\nreappeared holding a four-leaf clover.\nIn order to progress to the semi-finals, our first team had to win 7\u20133\nagainst number two seeds York 1\nand our second team just had to beat\nWarwick 2. Now armed with the clo-ver, there was no way we could lose. It\nseemed to be working, with Nigel and\nLewis winning their first frames. Amish was having less success, however\nwith the rest of the team vigorously\nrubbing the clover, Amish\u2019s opponent\nthen potted the cue ball on the final\npink before hitting his head on the table light, both actions met with cheers\nof \u2018Clover Power!\u2019\nAlthough Will whitewashed former\nImperial team player Joao Bento 3\u20130,\nunfortunately the second team went on\nto lose their match 9\u20136, and with the\nfirst team outplayed and losing 8\u20132 to\nYork, both teams headed to the pub to\ndrown their sorrows of their early exit\nfrom the competition. Now, all sights\nare set to next month when our two\nteams will head to Leeds hoping for\nbetter results and luck at the BUCS\nSnooker Championships.\nDeep concentration needed by Imperial to sink the red.\n\n"

    "content": "T\nhis is not what you would\ncall a normal book review,\nbutthat\u2019sjustbecauseSozaboy is not a normal book.\nIt is not one of those novels that after you have finished reading\nyou\u2019ll put back on the shelf. No, when\nyou will be done reading Sozaboy you\nwill give it to everyone you know. This\nhappened to me because Sozaboy is a\nbook that makes you perceive injustice\nand when you perceive injustice, especially when you are young, you want to\nmake other people aware and want to\ndo something.\nSozaboy is a book about war and the\ndumbness of war as seen by a young\nNigerian boy. The historical context\nin which Sozaboy is set is the Nigerian Civil War. But Sozaboy is not a\nbook on a particular war because it\nexpresses the despair and sorrows that\ncharacterize every war. The message\ncarried by Sozaboy extends beyond a\nparticular time and setting. Sozaboy is\na young recruit in the Nigerian Army\nwho initially believes that the folly all\naround him has a meaning, only to later discover the contrary. The power of\nthe novel lies in the language used by\nKen Saro-Wiwa to express Sozaboy\u2019s\nperception of the world. In fact this\nnovel is written in \u201crotten English\u201d, a\nmixture of \u201cNigerian pidgin English,\nbroken English and Idiomatic English\u201d.\nThis language adaptation results in an\nextraordinary realism and a very effective communication, which fascinates\nthe reader straight away.\nKen Saro Wiwa, was hanged on\nNovember 10, 1995 by Nigerian Authorities, with the formal accusation\nof inciting riots and separatism. The\ninformal reason is that he had been\nannoying. He claimed that the Multinational Corporations prospecting\nfor oil in the Niger Delta had to share\nthe profits. He accused the oil industry of damaging the environment. He\nrevealed the paradox that somehow\nthe more resources a country has the\npoorer it is. He denounced the genocide of the Ogoni people. He wrote\nSozaboy. And he was killed.\nOne year after the execution Human\nRight activists and Ken Saro-Wiwa\u2019s\nfamily brought lawsuits against Royal\nDutch Shell, accusing the company\nof being involved in Ken Saro-Wiwa\u2019s\ndeath. In 2009 Shell opted for a settlement out of court with the Saro-Wiwa\nfamily.\nAlthough Shell justified the decision by saying that they wanted to\n\u201cmove on\u201d, some people thought that\nthis proved that Shell had something\nto hide and that it had responsibilities in Ken Saro-Wiwa\u2019s death, but this\nis another story. This is not the place\nto discuss these lawsuits. And it is not\neven the place to talk about Ken SaroWiwa\u2019s importance as a Human Right\nand Environmental Activist. This is\nthe place to discuss Ken Saro-Wiwa\u2019s\nwords, which were dangerous and\nannoying.\nKen Saro-Wiwa was afraid that his\nwords might be forgotten. But writ-ing, thinking and discussing his words\nand writings means that we know\nthem and that we know that they are\nstill dangerous if they continue to be\nknown. His books are still a powerful\nand pacific weapon against any kind\nof injustice and power. A lesson to\nbe learned from Ken Saro-Wiwa\u2019s life\nand words is that he didn\u2019t protest, did\nwhat he did, and wrote what he wrote\non the basis of some abstract belief or\nabsolute idea.\nHe didn\u2019t protest because he was an\nenvironmentalist or because he hated\nmultinational corporations. He was\nan intellectual and he understood perfectly that the development of his peo-ple, the Ogoni people, could have been\npromoted by the wise use of his land\u2019s\nresources. But he protested because\nhe perceived evident injustice in how\nthese resources were managed.\nKen Saro-Wiwa\u2019s words are still im-portant, and still dangerous for some-one, but only if they are known, only\nif we remember the lives of true, real\npeople like Ken Saro-Wiwa.\nWar, Genocide and Human Rights- Sozaboy\nEdoardo Borgomeo looksatSozaboybyKenSaro-Wiwa,itstragicthemesandevenmoretragicbackstory\nT\nhe Royal Court Theatre\nproduction of Jerusalem\nis named after William\nBlake\u2019s iconic poem of the\nsame name. A favourite\nhymn to many, Jerusalem reveres the\nmajesty of bucolic England \u2013 a countryside so beautiful that Christ must\nsurely have been born here. It is with\na sense of irony then that Jez Butterworth\u2019s play begins with the morn-ing-after-the-night-before carnage at\nJohnny \u2018Rooster\u2019 Byron\u2019s trailer in the\nwoods of Flintock, Wiltshire. Rudely\nawoken by the local council on St\nGeorge\u2019s day issuing an eviction notice in lieu of a decision to build the\nnew estate in Rooster wood, Johnny\nstumbles out, limping, and fixes his inevitable hangover with a milk, raw egg\nand vodka concoction. This spinner of\nyarns is a modern day Pied Piper, father and drug dealer rolled into one, as\nhis home of twenty years is local party\ndestination for underage revelers and\nold friends alike. St George\u2019s day heralds the beginning of the annual Flintock village fair and presents a chance\nfor Johnny and his motley crew to do\nwhat Brits do best and go mental.\nThe play is quick-witted, uproarious\nand bears all the hallmarks of modern\nBritish culture: binge drinking, underage sex, Morris dancing, cups of tea,\nbacon rolls and village fetes. The post-party destruction in the first scene is\nall too familiar to students and signals\nthe squalid and debauched lifestyle\nwhich Johnny has become famed for\n\u2013 a sharp contrast to the idyllic forest\nsetting, the real trees used on stage and\nthe various live animals that make an\nJerusalem- Perfection in the Westend?\nCaz Knight goestoseetheRoyalCourt\u2019stransferofJerusalem,aquickwittedsatireofmorrisdancingandbingedrinking\nappearance throughout the perform-ance, including the chickens which live\nunder the Rooster\u2019s trailer.\nJerusalem treats us to some brilliantly bizarre scenes which see Johnny recounting the tale of his encounter with\na one hundred foot giant, a professor\ndonning a Pope\u2019s hat on acid and the\nvery awkward conversation between\nthe Rooster and his ex- about taking\nhis little boy Marky to the fair as the\nex- snorts coke and the boy is out of\nsight in the trailer. The three acts are\npunctuated by bursts of song from\nPhaedra, the fifteen-year-old runaway,\nwhose stepfather beats Johnny up in an\nincredibly intense and moving scene in\nwhich he is assaulted to the sound of\nJoni Mitchell-esque music.\nMark Rylance gives an superbly entertaining performance as the pathetic\nanti-hero, Johnny Byron, evoking all\nthe pity that such a mess of a character rightly deserves, without any of the\nself-indulgent monologues as he did as\nHamm in the recent West End production of Beckett\u2019s Endgame. Mackenzie\nCrook does what he does best, making\ncomedy out of the weedy, nerdy roles\nhe is landed with, as wannabe DJ, Ginger, while the rest of the cast make up a\nperfect crew of West Country wasters.\nJerusalem is such an excellent and hilarious social satire that it would not be\nsurprising if it were made into a television comedy sometime in the future: it\nwould definitely have a lot of viewers. The superbly entertaining Mark Rylance as Johnny \u201cRooster\u201d Byron\nA very strange fancy dress party. Look, Mackenzie Crook has come as Adam!\n13\nfelix FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

We\u2019re excited about playing\nthem live.\nGP: Your latest release Night is the\nNew Day is very different from the albums you made before.\nJR: Yeah, it was a harder writing process this time, but we\u2019re happy with the\nresult. We haven\u2019t written songs just by\njamming as a band for 10 years, so it\nwas a more rewarding experience.\nGP: You\u2019re playing with new members\nlive though?\nJR: Well we recorded the album as a\nfive-piece, but after it was done the\nsecond guitarist Fred and bass player\nMattias left because they\u2019ve got families now.\nGP: No more rock n\u2019 roll excess?\nJR: (laughs) No, they can\u2019t anymore.\nThey\u2019d been with us for a while too.\nThe new guys are great though.\nGP: How long\u2019s the tour going to be?\nJR: It keeps growing, man. It\u2019s seven\nweeks for now, we\u2019re going all round\nthe world. We\u2019re starting our European\ntour in March, then it\u2019s Scandinavia,\nVocalist Jonas Renkse (aka Lord Seth) and guitarist Anders Nystr\u00f6m formed the\nSwedish metal band Katatonia in the early 90s, and have been consolidating an\never-growing fan base since then. Starting out as doom metal, over recent years\nKatatonia have moved towards a form of \u201cdark rock\u201d, retaining goth and metal\ntinges. Though Swedish goths may not have a reputation of being the most cheery\nbunch around town, Renkse was more than happy to answer my questions as\nKatatonia prepare for their upcoming European tour. - Greg Power\nApplications are invited for the position of\nHALL SENIOR\nin\nSOUTHWELL HALL\nSouthwell Hall is one of four halls of residence located around Evelyn\nGardens, just off Fulham Road in South Kensington.

We\u2019ll end in the U.S.\nGP: It\u2019s a new sound you\u2019ve achieved\nwith \u201cNight Is the New Day\u201d. You\u2019ve\nditched screaming and are singing\nthroughout.\nJR: Well, I try to sing.\nGP: How did that switch come about?\nJR: I lost the technique because we\nweren\u2019t rehearsing enough, and growling is like anything: if you don\u2019t prac-tice, you lose it.\nGP: And Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt (Opeth\nfrontman) replaced you on vocals for\na while, right?\nJR: For a full-length album and an EP.\nHe\u2019s a really good friend of ours, along\nwith the rest of Opeth.\nGP: \u00c5kerfeldt called your new album\none of \u201cthe greatest \u2018heavy\u2019 record[s]\u201d\nhe has heard in the last 10 years and \u201ca\nmasterpiece\u201d.\nJR: (laughs) Yes it was cool hearing\nthat.\nGP: The album has gotten great reviews all round, so your switch to singing must have paid off.\nJR: Definitely, we\u2019re thrilled that people like it.

I\u2019ve been listening to\nTool since the 90s, they changed my\nsongwriting.\nGP: Did you listen to Puscifer, Maynard James Keenan\u2019s solo project?\nJR: Well I tried to, but I just couldn\u2019t\nget into it.\nGP: So they\u2019ll be no electro-comedy\nsolo album from you then?\nJR: (laughs) Not yet at least.\nGP: Is it all metal, all the time for you?\nJR: No, I listen to a lot of different\nstyles. My favourite singer is Mark\nKozelek, from Red House Painters\nand Sun Kil Moon. It\u2018s just acoustic\nguitar and soulful vocals, I love it. I\nalso love Nick Drake, and lots of jazzy\nstuff.\nGP: A solo jazz album maybe?\nJR: I would definitely love to do one,\nbut I\u2019ll probably try to incorporate that\nstuff into Katatonia\u2019s music.\nGP: Last two questions. What\u2019s your\npoison?\nJR: Well, I mostly just drink beer. But\nI guess if I have to choose, I\u2019ll go for\nWhite Russian.\nGP: Like in the Big Lebowski.\nJR: Exactly.\nGP: And since this is for Imperial College, do you have a favourite Star Wars\ncharacter?\nJR: Aw man, you should be talking to\nAnders.

They are The\nReturn of the King (4), Titanic (5) and Ben Hur\n(not pictured)\nThe Godfather (6) caused a lot of\ncontroversy at the 1973 Academy\nAwards. Marlon Brando declined\nhis Oscar by sending a Native\nAmerican actress instead to explain\nhis reasons, she turned out to be a\nfraud. Nina Rota\u2019s famous score was\nquickly removed from nominations\nafter it was discovered the famous \u2018Love\nTheme\u2019 was taken from an earlier film .\nNot shy from controversy as well was\nSlumdog Millionaire (7) which cleaned up\nat the 2009 Oscars with an incredible eight\nOscars.

Pyscho(9) didn\u2019t receive a single\nnomination even though it now\nrecognised as one of Hitchcock\u2019s\ngreatest achievements.\nTaxi Driver (10) is an acquired taste.\nIt\u2019s my favourite film of all time but it\nwas a chilly day in Hell when Rocky\ntook the Oscar for Best Picture and\nDirector.

Indie cinema\nwasn\u2019t considered cool then and so the\nAcademy unforgivably overlooked it -no nominations.\nLike (11) The Thin Red Line (13) was\nnominated for seven Oscars.

So, after a\none hour delay, it was game on.\nIC got off to a steady start. With the\nhelp of Caroline, Carina and Rabiya\nin the midfield, the forwards Hilary,\nSoraya and Annabel were seeing a lot\nof the ball in the opposition\u2019s D.\nOur reliable defence were also always\nthere to halt any counter attacks made\nby the opposition, who really struggled\nto penetrate our D. Before long, Annabel opened the score line with a simple\ntap in and IC were ahead.\nSoon afterwards, Maddie, Ann Marie\nand Amanda, who had been cheering\nfrom the sidelines and bantering with\nthe friendly umpire subbed on. Within\na few minutes, thanks to some beautiful passing by IC, Amanda added to\nthe tally with a superb strike that flew\npast the keeper\u2019s right shoulder.\nIC dominated the rest of the first\nhalf, and with three more strikes from\nAmanda smashing the back of the net,\nwe were feeling quite content with the\ncomfortable lead going into the break.\nIC came out fiercely in the second\nhalf and continued with their ferocious\nattack. Some excellent interceptions\nand wonderful hockey saw more Imperial goals fly past the keeper into the\nnet courtesy of Annabel, Soraya and\nAmanda (who went on a slightly mad\ngoal spree).\nEven our captain Carina couldn\u2019t resist a cheeky goal when the ball made\nit through to her in the middle of the\nD. As IC steamed ahead, the weather\ndecided to play bad cop and for the last\nten minutes, Imperial were exposed to\nsleet and snow in blizzard conditions.\nThe pitch was swiftly being coated by\na thick white blanket of snow and a\nmomentary lapse meant that IC had to\nhold their breath in the last few minutes of the match as St Bart\u2019s won a\nstring of short corners. While the team\nstruggled to make out the lines on the\npitch, our goalie Gemma was called\ninto action. Thanks to some marvellous defending by Alice, Kathryn, Izzy,\nFi (who took a little knock in the shoulder when one of their players tried to\ntake her down with a hockey ball), and\nof course Gemma, IC secured another\nclean sheet and their 10th victory in a\nrow, wreaking havoc upon their opponents with an awesome final score of\n14-0.\nAmanda Cheung Hockey\nImperial College Women\u2019s 2nd XI 14\nSt Bart\u2019s Women\u2019s 2nd XI 0\nImperial College Football Club last\nmonth held the inaugural Kick 4 Life 5\na-side tournament in Ethos. Elite footballers from across our university were\ninvited to test themselves at the highest level of indoor football, all in the\nname of raising funds for Kick 4 Life.\nThe event attracted a diverse range\nof teams including notorious choke\nartist Jack Jeffries and his Band of Gentlemen, Ahmed Farag\u2019s Mediterranean\nMagicians, the Southside Legends led\nby Phil Meier, Fitsum Degefa\u2019s Wilson\nKings, the RAF squadron marshalled\nby Mike Turrell, ABACUS captained\nby Matt Wong as well as a Kick 4 Life\nteam doing its best to represent the\nfoundation. Over 2 Sundays in January\nall of the sides contributed some dazzling football as well as some generous\ndonations culminating with the Wilson Kings coming away as winners of\nthe championship and almost \u00a3400 being raised to help increase awareness\nof HIV/AIDS in Lesotho.\nFootball has an incredible ability to\nbring people together, to evoke fierce\npassion and also to improve lives for\nthe better. You might question the final part of that statement, however\nthrough organisations involved in the\nDevelopment through Football pro-gram, organisations like Kick 4 Life\nwhich have recognised the amazing\npower that football has to draw people\ntogether. Founded in 2005 the foundation arranges regular football tournaments throughout Lesotho where\nchildren of all ages are encouraged to\ndemonstrate their skills while also having access to free HIV education and\ntesting. In a country where being HIV\npositive is associated with the worst\nsocial stigma and often leads to outcast\nstatus, Kick 4 Life provide a new perspective for those with and without the\ndisease. By creating an atmosphere of\npositive peer pressure through bringing people together for sport, they\nmake sure all of the children at their\nevents get themselves tested and that\ntheir parents do too. The Development\nthrough Football program has changed\nthe lives of so many individuals from\nUganda to Cambodia, Palestine to\nAustralia. It is an honour to have\nhelped raised funds which I hope can\nchange the life of at least one person\nfor the better.\nAs a university football club we carry\na lot of responsibility on our shoulders;\norganising training, matches and social\nevents for more than 120 members.\nResponsibility takes many forms and\nwhen you have the power to contribute\nsomething positive for those less fortunate then you have to seize it. Every\nmember of our club loves the game we\nplay, so we took advantage of this to\ncreate an event to mirror those held by\nKick 4 Life, even involving the NHS to\nconduct chlamydia testing.\nThe first week of the event consisted of quick fire round robin matches,\ndominated by Southside Legends who\nwon all their games with quality performances all round with Justin Whitehouse and Phil Meier looking solid at\nthe back while Mamzi Roshid netted a\nbag of goals up front. There were some\ntight affairs though with the Mediterraneans, Wilson Kings and the Kick 4\nLife team all looking strong. Moment\nof the day came when Club Captain\nEd Lobb nutmegged Vice Captain Pete\nFrampton to help the Kick 4 Life team\nto victory.\nThe second week of proceedings\ncaused real fireworks. There was controversy as Jack Jeffries Gentlemen\nwere denied a place in the knock-out\nstages on goal difference only to be\nthoroughly beaten by ABACUS in\nthe wooden spoon match. More controversy followed in the quarter final\nmatch between Wilson Kings and the\nRAF as Mike Turrell scored an opening\ngoal of questionable legality.

He was climbing with three\nother Imperial students during a trip\nwith the ICU club which took place on\nthe Welsh mountains of Cwm Cneifion\nin Snowdonia.\nThe fall occurred as the climber was\ntrying to negotiate a steep section of\nice which had come to be known as\nthe \u2018Tower Slabs\u2019. He tumbled through\n100ft, the height of a 10-storey build-ing, before safety equipment arrested\nhis fall. If it were not for his ropes and\nhis belayer (climbing partner) he would\nhave fallen another 150ft and possibly\nwould have suffered much more seri-ous, if not fatal, injuries. The climber is\nconsidered to be very lucky to have escaped injuries other than a split lip and\na broken bone in his face. His belayer\nsuffered no injuries.\nAt the time of the fall, two of the local mountain rescue team happened\nto be close to the scene and were able\nto offer help and first aid to the fallen\nclimber. They feared that the fall might\nhave caused internal injuries, so the\nSea King helicopter was swiftly summoned and the injured ICMC member\nwas airlifted to Bangor hospital for a\nmedical examination.\nChris Lloyd is a team member of the\ntwo rescuers who offered assistance\nafter the fall, from the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation.\nHe describes the events of that after-noon, which actually began with another party of nine requesting aid for\na suspected broken leg. \u201cAt 2pm, we\nreceived a call to help someone with\na broken leg\u2026in a party of nine from\nChester.

Two of our\nteam members were actually climbing\nnearby and witnessed what happened\nso they went to help him straight away.\u201d\nThe Sea King helicopter immediately\nrushed the Imperial student to hospi-tal, who was feared to have suffered\ninternal injuries, and then returned to\nthe scene to rescue the man with the\nsuspected broken leg.\nThe Imperial Mountaineering Club\nwas described as being well equipped,\nand the fallen climber was described\nby Thomas Coyne (Chair of ICMC) as\n\u201cexperienced\u201d.

During this adventure they will enter 16 countries across the continent.\nTheir hope is to raise \u00a310,000, and they\u2019ve aptly named their journey\nthe 10k for 10k Challenge.\nThe 5-month adventure will start in March when David and Matthew\nset off from the French channel. However, as matters in life dictate Matthew and Luke will have to split the 10,000 miles between them whilst\nDavid completes the round-trip entirely. Luke will take up the last 5,000\nmiles starting from Greece\u2019s capital, Athens.\nA 2nd year Chemical Engineer, Luke is eager to get going as soon as\nImperial will let him. He says: \u201cAs soon as exams are over, I\u2019m preparing\nto leave for Athens. I\u2019ve got three days after my last exam.\u201d\nAsking him what his drive was behind this epic task, it was clear that\nalongside raising money for three chosen charities, there\u2019s a desire to\ntravel and see different places.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personal challenge. I haven\u2019t seem many places and when David\nasked me to come along for the ride, I couldn\u2019t really turn it down. Loads\nof my friends are doing the whole Ibiza thing, which they\u2019ve been asking\nme to come along for, but obviously this is going to be a lot better.\u201d\nHe\u2019s clearly excited about his decision. When probed about what he\u2019s\nmost looking forward to, his answers are very specific.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of adventure, obviously, as we camp every night by the\nside of the road in the middle of nowhere. Also, the route is planned out\nbut we\u2019re going to have SatNavs with us. There\u2019s still going to be those\nquick decisions we\u2019re going to have to make. I think that\u2019ll be exciting.\u201d\nLuke also speaks of the dangers of his voyage across Europe comically.\n\u201cYeh, I\u2019m also scared of meeting any murderers and then defending myself when I can\u2019t speak the language.\u201d\nTalking about his riding partners, Luke\u2019s also taking his relationship\nwith them lightly.\n\u201cDave\u2019s a man of few words. He\u2019s a simple man, and I\u2019m going to be\nalone with him for 2 months. Though, we all have the same amount of\npassion for this as this bike ride will be as much of a physiological challenge as physiological one.\u201d\nThe \u00a310,000 they hope to raise will go to three charities. Luke explained their reasoning.\n\u201cWe all feel very passionate about what these charities do and so we\nfelt that by doing this bike ride we could help them raise money by using\nthe skills we have. Geoff and Julie Henson live locally to us who run the\nJukado district development fund. I have a lot of respect for these people\nas now that they\u2019ve retired, they commit a large part of their lives to trying to help the Gambians build a health clinic which is vital to the health\ncare of the local people in that area.\nWe also personally believe that the performance of Paralympians was\ninspirational. However with the current situation, it is a lot easier for\nan Olympian to achieve their dreams than it is for a Paralympian as the\namount of funds aren\u2019t out there (i.e. less sponsorship deals and media\ncoverage).\nFinally we\u2019ve decided to raise funds for Brake as well. Dave, Mathew\nand I have had close friends of ours die in car crashes who were only\nin the year above us in school. Things like that can often be avoided\nquite easily and Brake does try to reduce these incidents occurring by\nmethods that we feel are effective. We would like to try to reduce these\nincidents occurring and this is the way we feel we can contribute.\u201d\nDavid and Luke expect to arrive back on August the 18th, leaving Luke\nanother six weeks before he returns to Imperial.

    "content": "8 felix FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhat really causes the Business Cycles?\nchange, calculating business decisions,\nand storing accumulated wealth. It\ngrew out of the barter system primarily when the following problem presented itself: what if the other party to\nthe exchange doesn\u2019t want what I have\nto offer?\nThe problem was resolved by expanding the chains of exchange beyond two people. Over time, it is noticed that certain items are required\nwith great frequency.\nOf these commonly used commodi-ties, some can be stored without losing\ntheir value (for example, food rots and\nsome technologies may become obso-lete). Some things pack great value into\na small weight and volume, and so are\neasy to hide in the house and transport\nwhen needed.\nAgain, only some of these will be divisible into small parts of little value,\nwithout losing their value. If all of\nthese conditions are met by a particular commodity, something interesting\nhappens.\nPeople would start to accept it as\npayment not for personal use, but because they know they can trade it for\nwhatever they will want at a later time.\nThe commodity has become money.\nTraditionally, gold and silver have been\nthe most popular choices because they\nhave all of the qualifications listed\nabove.\n*\nMANIPULATING THE MONEY\nMARKETS\nSo how does this relate to the business\ncycle? Remember that money is ultimately just a commodity that\u2019s being\nused as a medium of exchange. Like\nany commodity, it is subject to the\nlaws of supply and demand. In an ideal\nsituation, the supply of money is determined by the amount of money being\nsaved and deposited in banks, and the\nborrowers in the economy determine\nthe demand for money. The price of\nmoney is the interest rate presented to\nborrowers and savers.\nAnd again, just like any other com-modity, manipulating the price of\nmoney against its economic equilibrium causes problems. When the banking system creates money out of thin\nair, it presents it to be borrowed alongside the real supply created by people\nsaving money.\nAs a result, the supply of money is\nflooded and the price of borrowing\nis artificially lowered. This has two\nprincipal effects: it discourages people\nfrom saving money, and it encourages\npeople to borrow money. Clearly, this\ndislocates the balance between savers\nand borrowers.\nThis manipulation of the money supply has been the single most important\ncause of every artificial boom and subsequent bust since the American recession of 1921. In each instance, coercive\nmismanagement has greatly worsened\nthe problem.\nNotice that was the \u2018recession of\n1921\u2019 rather than the \u2018recession of the\n1920s\u2019 precisely because the Warren\nG. Harding administration rightly embraced it as the healthy correction to\nFirst World War over-spending. Back\nthen, America was saved from the\ngreatest excesses of intervention by\na Federal budget equal to just ten per\ncent of GDP, compared with over thirty percent today. The administration\u2019s\neconomic understanding was nonetheless an important factor.\n\u201c[ideally] the\nsupply of money\nis determined\nby money being\nsaved in banks,\nand borrowers\ndetermine\ndemand\u201d\nIt recognised the problem as the\nsimple realisation that assets are over-priced, an understandable increase in\nrisk-aversion, and liquidity issues for\nfirms and their customers. Unlike all\nsubsequent administrations to date, it\ndid not pick out the one saving grace of\nrecession \u2013 lower price levels \u2013 as the\nproblem to \u2018correct\u2019.\nSince then, every government in the\nUS, nearly all British governments, and\nmost governments elsewhere have behaved in the same way. Every time a\nprice correction is needed, they rein-flated. This is despite the obvious damage (as with the Depression) or public\nanger (as with the recent TARP). This\nrepresents the political favouritism\nshown towards the logically impaired\nand empirically debunked Keynesian\nSchool, becuase it calls for huge government spending. And as Richard\nNixon famously explained in 1971, \u201cwe\nare all Keynesians now.\u201d\nEdward Townes explains the once forgotten, now rapidly growing, view of the Austrian School of Economics\nT\nhe silver lining of the 2008\nrecession has been people\nremembering that personal financial understanding\ndirectly relates to our own\nindividual wealth. Understanding what\ncaused the recession gets us a long way\ntowards identifying how we can personally reduce the impact of the next\nrecession on ourselves. We could even\nput ourselves in a position to benefit\nfrom it. It is now clear that the practical value in sound economics is not restricted to financial professionals and\npolicy makers.\n*\nBUSINESS CYCLES AND THE\nRECESSION\nThe mainstream politicians and pundits who foresaw nothing of the crisis\nand advocated the wrong remedies are\nsticking to the old political adage not\nto waste a crisis. They have spotted an\nopportunity to anchor their ideology\ninto conventional wisdom. By far the\nworst possible ending to this story involves us letting them do this. Over recent decades the well-intentioned but\ngravely misinformed people, who are\nalso disproportionately represented in\npolitics, have significantly slowed economic development. Today, as always,\nthey are appealing to the same irrationality that allowed and then inflated\nthe problem.\nDeregulation is a favourite explanation for why things got so out of hand\nin the financial markets, but this appeals only to ignorance. Finance is easily one of the most heavily regulated\nindustries and almost all the misdeeds\noccurred right under the noses of the\nexisting regulators. Furthermore there\nare numerous laws that demonstrably\ncreated incentives to lend money ir-responsibly. Other explanations generally focus on blaming symptoms\nof the problem, such as bonuses and\ncompensation in the financial indus-try, predatory lending, and speculative\nbubbles.\nThe question of who is to blame is\nsimultaneously dismissed as childish\nand answered with \u2018the greedy banks\u2019\nor \u2018irresponsible borrowers\u2019. In fact, the\ngeneral explanation was discovered by\nLudwig von Mises, one of the greatest economists of the last century. His\nexplanation of the business cycle was\ndeveloped by F.A. Hayek, for which he\nwon a Nobel Prize in 1974.\n*\nTHE ORIGINS OF MONEY\nThe core of the problem is the way\nnew currency is created. Understanding how our currency affects our economy is crucial, but not immediately\nobvious. The injustice and destruction\ncaused by the current monetary system depends on the subject being\nconsidered to be beyond the intellectual grasp of the average voter in order\nfor it to continue unnoticed. In reality,\nthe system is not especially difficult\nto understand once you side-step the\nmyriad of obfuscation, which has been\nbuilt up around it to create a barrier\nthat hides what\u2019s really going on.\nMoney is about facilitating ex-Left to right: Alan Greenspan, lucky winner of the Enron Prize for Public Service, kept interest rates artificially lower than its market rate throughout his eighteen-year reign as Fed Chairman; his\nsuccessor continued the policy - Bernanke\u2019s academic specialism is \u2018causes of recessions\u2019; Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman went further - he called for a housing bubble to \u2018reinflate\u2019 after the .com bust.\n\u201c...the current\nsystem [is] dressed\nas beyond the\nintellectual grasp of\nthe average voter\u201d\n\u201cDeregulation\nis a favourite\nexplanation...but\nthis appeals only to\nignorance\u201d\n\n"

But few of you innocent\nreaders will, I venture, have been ensnared by a love that dares to write its\nname in blue, black and green ink on\nany sheet of paper that floats within\nthe reach of its venal claws.\nThe irresistible fascination of pens,\npaper, and the combined paraphernalia of printing makes the lure of the stationery shop greater and more exciting\nthan that of any other den of iniquity\nfound on the high street. A sideways\nglance at the fluttering covers of untar-nished notebooks is enough to punch\na hole through the binding of my heart\nand staple my throat to the pit of my\nstomach\nThere is nothing more romantic than\nthe terrifying and nothing more capable of inducing terror than the un-known. Those of you emboldened by\nyour Valentine\u2019s day experiences may\nwish to expand on this comparison,\nbut I urge you to do so when you are\nalone.\nNot for nothing has the tantalising\ndraw of terra incognita always been\nmatched with the fear of inconceivable\nterror. The appeal of untrodden worlds\nand the attraction of the night sky\u2019s\nimpenetrable blackness owe as much\nto their potential for horror as the possibilities they offer for adventure. And\nDeath, the greatest of all unknowns \u2013\nthe unsolvable variable, if you will, in\nthe Diophantine equations of destiny\n\u2013 has become the most mythologised\nof life\u2019s tribulations. Rather than ignore\nthe fatal elephant in the room, centuries of religious thought have resulted\nin the stray pachyderm being strewn\nwith sweet-smelling flowers, and laden\nwith as much romance and saccharine\ntripe as it can bear.\nBut, I hasten with an unforgivable\ndisregard for the rules of ordinary\nsyntax to stress, there can be nothing\nmore terrifying than the tabulated perfection of an empty page. The millions\nof characters who can, in a blink of an\neye, be conjured up to crowd those narrow margins. The lives and romances,\nthe truths and ironies, phrases opulent\nwith rhetorical finery and laden with\norotund periphrasis fighting for space\nwith much simpler ones. A universe,\nin words or colours, symbols and lines,\nbrought to life with ink and graphite on\nsheets of compressed wood pulp.\nAn act of creation on this scale requires an accompanying ritual of suitable gravitas. Our Lord the Abrahamic\nGod had his 6 days of selective creativ-ity, while the Norse have the primeval\ncow Au\u00f0umbla without whose taste\nfor rime ice the likes of Noel Edmonds\nmight never have been born. In their\nstead, artists and authors have made a\ndeity out of emptiness and religion out\nof undiscovered potential.\nSo who can blame the fetishisation\nof apparatus that artistic endeavour\nhas engendered? The stationers and\narts supply stores of the world have become statuaries of sacred relics to be\nworshipped and revered before being\nbought by those of us with worryingly\nweak minds and bladders. And then, at\nlast, when the supplies have been safely\ncarried to one\u2019s personal altar of writing desk or study, the act of genesis can\nunfold.\nIf we look past the disused easels\nand mildewed keyboards littering the\nstudio of metaphor, and peel back the\nlayers on the collage of comparison,\nArt has far more in common with Science than is usually supposed. Note\nthe careful and sustained use of majus-cules in the preceding sentence. These\nare not merely the result of accidental\nflicks of a finger on an Apple keyboard\n(whose enervating complexity is such\nthat you would be forgiven for making\ntext bold, le traduire en Francais, and\nchanging the font when, had you\nbut chosen to play a different chord\non the ivory keyboard, you could have\nachieved the desired effect of aligning\nthe text with the left margin), but a\ndeliberate and deliberated choice. The\ncapital letters act, like the staccato dots\non written music, to indicate that the\nwords are to be given special emphasis outside of their immediate context.\nArt and Science are here to be treated\nas Abstract Concepts \u2013 as independent axes on the Cartesian graph of\nPretension.\nThe artist and the scientist are both\nfundamentally dissatisfied creatures.\nDissatisfied with their choice of clothing and ability to attract a partner per-haps, but more importantly, dissatisfied with the world around them and\nthe pitiful attempts others have made\nto explain it to them. Both are fascinated by the deepest questions of purpose\nand meaning, and are unwilling to accept easy answers. The palette and the\npipette, the acrylics and alkalis, the\nHCl and the HB pencil are all tools of\ncreation and discovery which allow\ntheir wielders to link arms as pioneers\non the frontiers of knowledge.\nOf all the filthy and depraved habits that artists and scientists share,\nhowever, the most invidious, insidi-ous, perfidious and hideous must be\nthe grotesque desire for independent thought. Nothing is as problematic to dictatorships and oligarchs as\nthe ability of individuals to think for\nthemselves. That and satire. Fascists\nhate satire. As Tom Lehrer was fond\nof quoting what Peter Cook was fond\nof saying, \u201cthose wonderful Berlin\ncabarets did so much to stop the rise\nof Hitler and prevent the outbreak of\nthe Second World War.\u201d Regardless of\nthis d\u00e9mod\u00e9 cynicism, those countries\nwith the greatest limitations on personal freedom will always be the most\nscientifically constipated and the most\nartistically repressed.\nArt and science cannot flourish independently of each other, or, to put\nit less arrogantly and more accurately,\nart and science will often flourish to-gether. The explosion of artistic styles\nwhich began on the Italian peninsula\nin the late 14th Century was accompanied by a literal rebirth and metaphorical maturity of experimental science.\nThe development of cubism, and Picasso\u2019s attempts to capture all the dimensions of space and time in a single\nimage, coincided almost exactly with\nthe birth of the Theory of Relativity,\nand its compression of the Universe\ninto one four-dimensional manifold.\nArtists and scientists alike refuse to\ndefer to any restrictive dogma. They\nfight for the truth and the right of individuals to interpret the world as they\nsee it. Given all this, it is remarkable\nhow proponents of these disciplines\ndevote their energies to looking down\ntheir noses at each other. Artists from\ntheir lofty, geometric perspective and\nscientists from their hidebound, invariant frame of reference.\nThis is why, in my mind, any attempt to bring C.P Snow\u2019s fabled \u2018Two\nCultures\u2019 closer together should be\nembraced with open arms and permanently stuck to one\u2019s heart with\ncyanoacrylate glue. And that includes\nthe upcoming ArtsFest, a week-long\nattempt by those Imperialites with a\nbad infection of sciencitis to raise the\nprofile of the arts on campus.\nArtistic endeavour, much like endeavour of any kind at this notoriously\napathetic campus, is lamentably un-dersubscribed and woefully underap-preciated. Let\u2019s try to change that this\ncoming week, as the walls shake to the\nsound of trumpets, and the walkway\nvibrates to the beat of drums.\nDevotedReaderconfesses their undying love\nF\nrom the first time I saw him\nat Fresher\u2019s Fair I knew he\nwas the one. He told me of his\nplans to be a journalist and\nhow writing for felix would\nchange my life. Would that he knew\nit was he who would change my life. I\nstared enraptured, a misty look across\nmy eyes \u2013 from that moment the flame\nin my heart was ignited\u2026\nfelix, I think I may be in love and the\nobject of my affections is someone you\nknow very well indeed. This love is so\nintense I must tell someone, and felix,\nyou are my only confidante. His monosyllabic name strikes a chord in my\nheart. Yet alas, I fear my love goes unnoticed - he doesn\u2019t even know who I am.\nTime and time again I peer through\nthe door of the felix office hoping to\ncatch a tiny glimpse of him, yet never\nbeing brave enough to enter. From\nsnatched glances through the window I\nsee the light from his Apple Mac reflecting against his raven hair, his glasses\nmasking my only window into his soul.\nFrom my vantage point outside the felix office I have observed many happen-ings. Occasionally I hear raised voices,\nmuffled by the door, the snatches of a\ndiscussion within. His passion for felix\nis evident in his tone, but only in my\ndreams does he feel this passion for\nme. It is always he who dominates the\narguments, his strong leadership is un-compromised by his adequate stature. I\nsometimes follow him on his short walk\nfrom Eastside to the Beit quad, seeing\nhim go about his daily life makes me feel\ncloser to him. Yet I can never be as close\nas I wish I could be.\nI always wonder about his enigmatic\nsmile. He seems so open yet I can sense\nfurther depths, secret sides of himself\nthat he conceals. His bold glasses represent a shield, protecting his delicate\nsoul from outside intrusions. I wish I\ncould teach him to open his heart to\nme. I would do anything for him, even\nventure to the darkest realms of his im-agination, which he hides so deftly.\nHe presents himself so well that I\ncannot imagine how anyone could resist him. His unique fashion sense captivates me. He should not have to hide\nbehind the words of his newspaper - in\nwriting and in the flesh he is a beautiful\nperson. In spite of this his writing in felix touches me like no other writer ever\ncould. Whilst I read I imagine his supple writer\u2019s hands, poised above the key-board, crafting his weekly masterpiece.\nSo I write this to you, felix, as an ode\nto the fire in my soul, the love of my\nheart, the light of my life. I am convinced that we are made for each other.\nHe just hasn\u2019t realised yet, perhaps this\nletter will finally make him notice me.\nMake him seek me out. Make him love\nme.\nGilead Amit, eventually, discusses ArtsFest\n\u201cI think I may\nbe in love, and\nthe object of my\naffection is...\u201d\n\u201cDeath is the\nunsolvable variable\nin the Diophantine\nequations of\ndestiny.\u201d\n\n"
