The forms were\nmarked by three people. For\nthe first allocation these were\nMessrs. Guy, Wield and Lafferty and twenty-two places\nwere allocated. In the second\nand third allocations these\nMessrs. Guy, Bubterworth,\nand Robinson. Commuter\nplaces were marked as fol-lows, there being over 700\napplications for 100 places: \u2014\nEach form was given 5\npoints each, and marked 3\ntimes separately. Of the 5\npoints 2 were for time and\nexpense saving (over half an\nhour per journey). This entailed a lot of time in the\nmarking, as each application\nhad to be checked with an\nAZ to get through the swelter of lies. One mark each\nwent for using the car in col-leg e, one for bringing people\nin, and one general mark.\nIn the allocation of residents places, one mark was\ngiven to residents whose\nhomes are a long way from\nLondon, 2 marks for use in\nCollege (one academic and\none Union), one for use for\na specific reason at weekends,\nELEPHANT\nBUILDINGS?\nLast Tuesday Mr. Sharp\ncontinued his series of lectures on the architecture in\nLondon. Most of the lecture\nwas devoted to showing\nslides of buildings in London\nand comments upon them.\nMr. Sharp expressed the\nopinion that modern architecture began in a zoo (shades\nof Dr. Morris). To be precise\nin the Penguin Pool in the\nzoological gardens. We were\nalso treated to a view of the\nnew elephant building which\nwas supposed to represent\nelephants eating.\nMr. Sharp thought that the\nnumber of impersonal blocks\nof flats without attendant\nfacilities was a direct result\nof lack of finance and not\nlack of ideas. The projectionist seemed to be amusing\nhimself in trying to get one\nof the sides the right way up,\nthis somehow led to the question of how high a building\nshould be. Other treats included a shot of the American\nEmbassy, the design of\nwhich was the result of an\nopen competition with the\ncondition that it should be in\nkeeping, with the other Georgian buildings! We also saw\na shot of the RCA building\non Kensington Gore. Mr.\nSharp thought this was very\nwell designed and that it\nlooked as good in the wet as\nas in the sun and even better\nin the half light of a fog. Unfortunately Mr. Philips expressed no opinion on the\nnew IC buildings.\nand one general mark. RESIDENTS places were only\nover applied for by a factor\nof 2. The reasons for 'the\ndelay were given as the time\ntaken to mark the forms, that\nis approximately 14 hours\nper person, the delay in\nchecking up whether commuters really would save\ntime or not, the time taken to\nsend out 700 replies, and delays by administration in getting out the stickers.\nDespite the criticism,\nKeith Guy has assured ICU\ncouncil that the system was\nas fair as possible, and President Corbyn expressed the\nview that it was a thoughtful\nand sensible way of se lec tion.\nll lli ili lli lil S Mooney's Moraine Muck Musters in\nSouthside Cellars.\nJAZZ SESSION\nOn the Sunday evening before last, IC Jazz club showed\nits face to the world for the\nI\\11iii iiii^ One of Photsocs. models from their portrait\nsession on Tuesday, October 14th. THE SIMON SOCIETY\n12.20 a.m. The scene \u2014\nWaterloo. A woman, in her\nforties, lies in the gutter. The\nambulance men recognise her,\nshe has been picked up by\nthem many times before. Her\ndisease?\u2014alcohol ism.\n2.00 a.m. The scene \u2014 a paper factory near Covent\nGarden. On this cold night\nfive old men sleep on the\npavement next to the hot air\nexhausts of the factory.\nThese are the types of\npeople that the Simon Community are trying to help.\nThese are the people who, for\ncircumstances beyond their\ncontrol, have fallen through\nthe net of the Welfare State.\nThe Community operates a house in Kentish Town where\nthey attempt to give social\ndropouts an opportunity to\nregain their self-respect.\nSimon reaches these people\nthrough its soup runs.\nThe procedure is this \u2014 a group of students in a van go\nto Simon HQ and collect the\nsoup and bread. They then\ndrive round to places such as\nCovent Garden and Charing\nCross, offering soup, conversation and a little humanity\nto these temps.\nI propose to set up a base\nfor this scheme at IC. Simon\nprovides i the soup, the college\nprovide the van, all we need\nis YOU to help distribute the\nfood in the early hours of the\nmorning. If you are interested\nin providing a service for\nthose people forgotten by the\nState, then please contact me\nvia the Union Office or Linstead 434.\nBRIAN HAINS\nfirst time at a packed free\nsession in the Union 'Lounge.\nThe evening started with\ntr ad jazz from the evergreen\n(take that how you like)\nSplinter Group, with John\nFranklin and Les Webb on\ntrumpet and clarinet consistently on form, and amongst\nthe sitters-in Bob Coomhes'\nroguish trombone was out-standing. The familiar numbers were put through their\npaces, and as ever it was\nastonishing to note the fluctuating personnel were all\nfamiliar with the intricacies\nof the old arrangements such\nas \"Hiawatha Rag\".\nThe harmonic basis of the\nblues, as played by the next\ntwo groups, is well known\u2014\nrepetitive, liberally embellished with ola piton as que clich es, and rather pretentious, as is\ninevitable when well-heeled\nyoung people in un cheap blues \"clobber\" and using\ngood equipment sing of the\nfrustrations of being penn i less, and woman less. Their\ndollies applauded the heroes,\nbut many in the audience\nfound the groups (one from\nIC and the other from Brunei)\nrather noisy and boring.\nAn ad-hoc modern jazz\ngroup followed the modern\nelectric blues with a rather\nmore interesting Charlie\nMinguis item, but then let\nthemselves down by starting\na number with \"My funny\nValentine\", shirking the challenge of a32 bar ballad, and\nending up as a fairly uptempo blues again. The evening finished with at rad^ based\njam session, including \"Mama\ndon't allow\", in which for\npossibly the first time ever at\nIC the drum breaks were\nplayed through without fluffs.\nFree Sunday evening sessions are continuing throughout the year, and with several\npotentially interesting groups\nbeing formed within the Jazz\nand Folk clubs and with a number of outside people\nturning up to play, these\nshould continue to attract a large and enthusiastic audi-en ce, as well as an enormous\nincrease in bar takings.\nSTUDENT\nHOUSE\nPROBLEMS\nIt is now twelve months\nsince the first I.C. student\nhouse (Mining House) was\nopened and about nine\nmonths since the opening of\nBernard Sunley House. Now\nthat most of the (teething\ntroubles have been or are\nbeing ironed 'out, life in them\nis beginning to take shape.\nAt a meeting some days\nago Ian Wells, warden of\nB.S. H.H., presented the first\nyear's accounts of his house\nand it seems that it will run\nadequately on the present\nrents for some time yet.\nAlthough a net loss of\naround \u00a3600 was reported,\n\u00a31000 was paid out in rent\nduring conversions, which\nshould be provided by the\ncollege, and \u00a3200 was wrongly\npaid to the G.P.O., to compensate for lack of money in\nthe coin boxes during the\ntime when they were not\nlocked. The G.P.O. has, however admitted liability for this\nand this amount will be re-turned. Thus a virtual profit\nof \u00a3600 was made during the\nyear. Before any undue optimism over rent reductions\nprevails however, it must be\npointed out 'that the year did\nnot contain a long vacation\nduring which i the usual rent\nhas to be paid to the landlords but during which room\nrents bring an la relatively\nsmall amount.\nThus, apart from heating\ncosts, rents are as cheap as in\nHall and are likely to remain\nso for some time.\nThe houses seem to have\nmore character than Hall in\nthat they are not situated\nright on the college site, and\nalso the pigeon hole-like\nstructure of i Southside is ab-sent. The residents of\nB. S.S.H. are now getting together to form a football\nteam, a bar football ladder,\nand various other communal\nactivities, and the house will\nsoon be acquiring a colour\nT.V. On i the debit side the heating problems have not yet\nbeen settled, although it is\nhoped that all electric sockets\nwill be wired through slot\nmeters, so that residents may\nuse their own fires. The reason for this is that in multiple rooms 4k Woon vector fires are fitted. These are\nfitted with thermostats, but\nnever seem to reach 'the cutoff temperature. Last year\nresidents used their own electric fires land an attempt was\nmade to assess how much\npower each had used and\ncharge accordingly. Although\nevery possible effort was\nmade to keep this fair some\nanomalies occurred. Wiring\nall sockets through meters\nwill be inherently fairer.\nAnother problem at present is security. During the\npast few weeks two thefts\nhave occurred; one person\nlosing a radio after a carpenter left his door unlocked\nafter attending to so repairs\nand another person losing \u00a36\nfrom a writing bureau. This\nraises the point that it is\nnormal to issue all maintenance personnel with master\nkeys when they require\nentrance. In a case like this\nwith the room left unlocked\nmost insurance policies are\ninvalid.\nAnother interesting point is\nthat in some cases two adjoining rooms are linked by\na fire door which must remain\nunlocked. If one room is left\nlocked 'but the other unlocked it is possible that insurance companies would\nclaim that both rooms are\ntechnically unlocked.\nDespite these problems it\nappears that in time solutions\nwill be found and student\nhouses will establish themselves as equals with halls of\nresidence.\nM.G. LAMBERT.\nBLUES\nCLUB\nWith dimmed lights and a receptive audience i the first\nconcert presented by the\nBlues Club got off to a good\nstart with an evening with Jo\nAnn Kelly. Her distinctive\ndriving voice and guitar playing soon won the audience of\n100 members and guests. Accompanied by Bob Hall on\nmandolin, 'she sang a varied\nselection of songs, including\n\"The Spider and the Fly,\"\nand was ably supported by\nthree college musicians.

It was of medium length, (six.\nhours) mediocre content, and fairly peaceful. Piers Corbyn\nwas able to maintain control over Council, although there\nwere no really heated debates. The consequences of the\nincrease in the numbers sitting on Council has yet to be\nfelt, however, since the department reps, have not yet been\nelected, and several members failed to turn up at this\nfirst meeting.\nThe main matter of interest to the Union member was\nfinance. The estimates put in at joint Council (held at the\nend of last session) were ratified, although there was some\nargument, particularly over Ents. expenses, periodicals\nand the FELIX subsidy from the Union.\nEnts. had asked for a nominal grant. This would mean\nthat they were no longer a profit making committee, but\nthat profits from the informal dances would be used to\ncover the formal occasions. Previously Ents were expected\nto make \u00a3500 profit on hops, and received subsidies for\nformal occasions. The new zero-grant arrangement was\napproved, but Ents were expected to make a slight profit.\nIn effect the new arrangements mean that the Union will\nlose \u00a3375 of its expected income.\nOn periodicals, it was decided to cancel those magazines\nwhich could be obtained elsewhere, e.g. in the libraries. There\nwas also some criticism, mainly ill-informed, of FELIX's increased grant of \u00a3800 from some council members,\nbut the new figure was approved.\nA more serious discussion arose over the gliding club.\nAs reported in Felicity 279, this club asked for, and got,\n\u00a31500 from I.C.U. for a new glider. However, they did not\nreveal that they were already trying to get \u00a3500 out of the\ncollege's Centenary Appeal Fund to replace another glider.\nCouncil was annoyed at this and refused to ratify the club's request to the fund. The club will explain its dealings at\nthe next Council meeting. Also to put in an appearance\nat the next meeting will be the student who was granted\n\u00a340 for a film about tribal warfare (?). He has apparently\nshot one third _of the film in Cornwall and London and\nused up most of his \u00a340, but will put up the rest of the\nmoney himself.\nNew Uses for Beit Rooms \u2014 I.C. Arts Lab?\nPiers & Co. at Council\nAnother matter discussed was the Senior Common\nRoom. To such comments as \"bugger the staff\", Council\npassed a motion from secretary Keith Guy that the Union\ndoes not recognise the existence of the Senior Common\nRoom. The Domestic Bursar was, however, said to be \"un-cooperative\" over the possible use of the SCR by students.\nA series of letters from Mr. Stephenson criticising the\nelection of Clive Robinson for the Council rep on the\nParking Committee were read; the objection to Clive being\nthat he parked in the Southside area last year without a permit. Also on parking, the 10/- fine for illegal parking\nwas reiterated. This fine will be automatically imposed on\npeople who persist in parking in the College controlled\nareas without a permit. It was felt that more places could\nbe obtained by more skilful markings on the roadway.\nJohn Darley will investigate the hostility of the Boat\nClub to students from other Colleges in the area joining.\nAll Colleges were circular is ed with a list of IC clubs\nwilling to accept other students, but when some from the\nCEM tried to join the Boat Club, which was on the list,\nthe club officials were hostile to them.\nOn the question of whether the reps on the new-structure\nULU Councils should be responsible to a Union Meeting.\nPiers Corbyn expressed the opinion that \"the Union doesn't usually know anything about it anyway\". Therefore, these\nreps will be mandated by and responsible to Council, but\nto help the poor ignorant Union member to understand\nthe new ULU structure, an open file on UL U will be set\nup in the Union Office.\nDiscussion at the House\nCommittee meeting on Tuesday, October 14th centred\naround the allocation of\nrooms in the Union building\nnow that more rooms have\nbecome available for use by\nthe Union.\nThe two most important\ndevelopments concerning\nallocation stemmed from a proposal by the Botany and\nZoology departments to use\nthe former Senior Common\nRoom as a coffee room for\nthe staff and students of\nthose departments during\ncertain hours, and a suggestion from Henry that the old\nSnack Bar be converted into a virtual I.C. Arts Lab.\nJohn Butterworth explained that Botany and\nZoology were now quite\nisolated following the opening of College Block and\nthe demise of catering\narrangements in the Union\nbuilding. Both staff and\nstudents were most keen to\nhave somewhere to meet\ninformally over a cup of\ncoffee for half an hour in\nthe morning and afternoon.\nThe Senior Common Room\nwas the ideal location for\nsuch a venture, and all the\nrequired items of crockery\netc. would be provided by\nthe departments.\nThe idea was approved,\nsubject to there being a student committee to run\nthe project and that the\nroom would be open to\neverybody outside the\nspecific hours when it would\nbe used by Botany and\nZoo.\nThe 'Arts Lab' proposal\nWas to provide a permanent\nroom in the Union with an\natmosphere suitable for the\nsmall events organised by the\ncollege 'Arts' societies.\nIt would have permanent\nlighting effects and an adaptable central area with\nscreens, etc., to allow for a wide range of activites. The\nroom would probably be\nused as a coffee bar with\nmusic at lunchtime.\nThe house committee asked for a more detailed plan,\nwhich would then be put to\nCouncil.\nThe other main decisions\ntaken concerned the\napproval of the occupation\nof Committee Room B by\nthe Carnival Committee\nthereby vacating 8, Prince's Gardens, which will now be\nused by the Art Club. Ents\nare to be allowed to use\nthe Powder Room in the\nUnion for the storing of the\nequipment.\nIt should also be mentioned that Social Clubs\ncan now book the old Senior\nCommon Room for events at\nmost times of the day, in the\nsame way as the other Union\nbook able rooms.\nHowl om\nak ey\nour money go further When the problem that you're faced with is the long ness of the time\ncompared with the shortness of the money, likely as not the answer\ncould be a visit to your local branch of Martins.\nAt Martins we have a way of applying all our experience of\nmanaging money to help you make the most of yours.\nCall in and have a word with the local Martins manager\u2014\nguaranteed un stuffy. We don't promise he'll make money for you,\nbut we're absolutely positive he'll see you get the best possible\nvalue out of whatever you've got.\nAsk him for the leaflet we've prepared specially\nfor students.\nMartins have a branch at\n35 Gloucester Road, London S.W.7.

Hockey\nThe first XI have played three matches so far this term\nand have won one very easily and lost the other two nar-row ly. Although this may not seem a very good start to the\nseason, the team has played well, and considering the fact\nthat the sides to whom we have lost have been together\nfor several years, once we settle down we should do well.\nThe second, third and fourth XIs have only played one\nmatch each; the second drew their match 1-1, the thirds won\n2-0, and the fourths won 6-2.\nUnfortunately, the numbers in the club are not sufficient to run the expected five elevens, but the existing teams\nhave a full fixture list right through 'till the end of next\nterm.\nIC 1st5 \u2014 LONDON HOSPITAL 1\nIC soon settled down in this, the first match of the\nseason, and Pratt scored the first goal after about 10 minutes.\nHe soon scored again, and Mudan also netted one to make\nthe score 3-0 in IC's favour at half-time. In the second half\nIC scored three more, Pratt completing his hat-trick and\nSargent adding the other. However, the second half was\nrather scruffy and London Hospital scrambled a goal late\nin the game.\nIC 1st1 \u2014 AYLESBURY 1st2 IC pressed hard in this match and were unlucky not to\nscore several times in the first half. In the second half, the\nplay on both sides degenerated into hitting the ball up the\nfield in the hope that someone might get it, instead of trying\nto construct moves. Our only goal came from Sargent, from\na penalty corner.\nIC 1st0 \u2014 GUY'S HOSPITAL 2\nThis was the best of the games to date. IC played much\nmore as a team, and were beaten through the superior teamwork of Guy's. Several of the Guy's eleven had in fact played\nfor them for about five years. Both their goals came in the\nfirst half, but in the second IC were unlucky not to score\nseveral times after good work on the right by Manning had\ncreated chances which were squandered by the other for-wards. Sargent at centre-half, Watson at full-back, and\nTownsley in goal all played well.\nTeam: Townsley; Burtt (Capt.) and Watson; NapierMunn, Sargent and Jield; Manning, Mudan, Pratt, Schofield\nand Bates.\nI.C.A. F.C. After a rather poor opening to the season in which the\n1st XI lost 5-2 at Harlington, one or two changes were made\nin the team which went to Woolwich last Wednesday for\nthe first league game. The result was a42 win for IC which\nis quite encouraging, as it is the first win against Woolwich\nfor three seasons. The very hard pitch made it difficult to\nplay good football but IC played well under the conditions\nand deserved the victory.\nBy half time IC were leading 1 -0 with a fine opportunist\ngoal from P. Williey after some hard work by R. Dixon.\nSoon into the second half IC went further ahead when P. Williey turned a good cross from T. McCardle into the net.\nIC were easily on top at this stage and with the back four\ncomfortably containing any Woolwich attack looked set\nfor a big win. When J. Darley scored from a corner with a spectacular if somewhat suicidal header, the game seemed\nto have been decided. However, Woolwich continued to\nattack and a slight defensive error let them in for a well\ntaken goal, Any chance of IC losing grip on the game was,\nhowever, unlikely after P. Williey scored his third goal from\na J. Kelly centre. Woolwich did in fact score a second goal,\nbut by then IC were prepared to trot to the final whistle.\nTwo of the most encouraging features of the game were\nthe very fine displays given by R. Barby in goal and W. Smith at wing half, neither of whom seemed to make a mistake throughout the game. With plenty of second XI players\npushing for places, the future looks bright for IC football\nthis season.\nTeam: R. Barley, P. Worthington, P. Langston, C. Willcock, J, Darley, W. Smith, J. Kelly, R. Dixon, T. McCardle, G. Barnard, P. Williey.\nTom McCardle, Capt.\nThe first ICWA hockey\nmatch played on Saturday,\nOctober 11th, against Queen\nElizabeth College resulted in\na win for IC by 7-3. This is a very encouraging start to the\nseason and with such reliable\ndefence and mobile attack\nthere should be many similar\nresults!\nTwo goals were disallowed;\none because the umpire\nthought she may have been\noffside. Playing and umpiring at the same time can be\nrather difficult! Perhaps I can take this opportunity of\nappealing for a referee. If\nanyone knows the rules of\nhockey and has some free\ntime on Wednesdays or Saturdays, the ICWA hockey\nteam would be grateful for\nhis or her services.\nFew of last year's team\nare still here, but there are\nmany good replacements,\nand with a little practice\n(and perhaps even some\n'training') we should have a successful year.\nTeam: J. Buzzard, S. Edwards, J. Allinson, S, Inskip,\nM. Lewis, H. Hutchins, A. Nightingale, S. Thompson,\nL. Beynon, M. Paluch.\nRugby\nThe season has started quite\nwell for the Rugby Club with\nseven teams taking the field\non Saturday and about forty\npeople training on Monday\nevenings.\nMainly through lack of\nfitness, the first XV went\ndown to the College of St.\nMark and St. John, and the\nBedford Wanderers, but I'm happy to report that Brunei\nUniversity were suitably\ntrounced last Wednesday. As\nyet the Ex. 1st have not\nplayed, but the Al XV seem\nto have a strong side judging by their win; even Frank\nBall, the captain, was off\nthe field having seven stitches\ninserted into his head! The\nA2 and Bl XV's suffered\nrather heavily against two\nstrong Saracen sides, but a slight mix-up in the matching of fixtures occurred, so\ndon't lose heart 2 XVs. The\nredoubtable A3's( the old\nB2) won their first match\nof the season in their old\nstyle, with the scrum-half\nplaying most of the match\nwithout a jersey!

Tony Carter\nfinished the first leg in 30th position, Rod Brook moved to\n22nd and then Norman pulled up a further ten places. Bob\nJenson, Chris Burden and Barry Dabrowski ran steadily over\nthe fourth, fifth and sixth legs to give us 15th place at the\nfinish.\nIC B team came 38th and were soundly beaten by the\nmotley C team (23rd), which included such dubious characters as A.

B Winks to You\nThe game itself bears no resemblance to the child's pastime of counters, as so many mis-informed people seem\nto think. It has been described as a game requiring more\nsophisticated tactics than chess, with the addition of the\nemployment of skill and experience. However, the players\nseen above seem to be more interested in experience than\nskill.\nSwimming\nPrior to this year the\nSwimming Club has tended\nto be restricted to competitive swimmers and experienced Water Polo players.\nNow, however, we are trying\nto expand our membership\nto include learner and inexperienced swimmers and polo\nplayers. This will not only\ngive us a more sound basis\nfor teams in the future, but\nwill also allow us to lower\nour subscription. At the beginning of the year the\nSwimming Club subscription\nwas fixed at 30/- per year.\nNow, the basic subscription\nhas been reduced to 10/- per\nyear with an additional\ncharge to cover hire of IC\npool. This charge per member will depend on the number of members, but we expect it to be about 5/-.\nTo encourage the less proficient swimmers, we have\nrestricted swimming training\nto the first half hour of each\nclub practice, we have started\na learners class every Friday;\nfull details are on the swimming club board in the\nSports Centre.\nLast season was one of\nmixed success for the club.\nIC easily won the UL swimming championships for the\nsecond successive year, and\nthis year we should have\nlittle difficulty in repeating\nour victory. In the UL water-polo league, IC played well\nagainst the top teams, but\nconceded points to weaker\nopponents and finished 3rd. This year with a lot of new\ntalent we are capable of\nwinning all three divisions of\nthe UL league. We will be\nThis year, in spite of ULU's protests, IC is again fielding\nfive table tennis teams, as opposed to the two or three\nteams run by most other col-leg es. The key factor in our\nsuperfluity of teams is not so\nmuch a proliferation of great\ntalent but more a steady inflow of enthusiastic players\nwho are keen enough to\ncome along and play at all\ntimes, and who enjoy the\nposition of representing their\ncollege in sport.\nThe fixtures of the club\nhave fluctuated from zenith\nto nadir over the past two\nyears, with last year's teams\nfailing to make much of an\nimpression. However, this\nyear, I hope, with the help\nof my zealous, hard-working\nsecretary, Arthur Choyce,\nand treasurer M, Harrison\nand our enthusiastic \"pin-gers\" to regain some, if not\nall, of the former success of\nour illustrious TT club.\nD.E.

It is capitalism.\nFELIX: Thes ideas were due\nto Marx originally?\nDr. Smith: Marx was the\nfirst person to put this on a scientific basis, Marx and\nEngels, and that's where all\nour ideas stem from. He did\nthis at a time when capitalism\nwas still really a progressive\nforce in that it was developing industry. But Marx was\nable to see, even at this stage,\nwhere it would lead to, from\nprivate enterprise to the formation of huge monopolies. He\nsaid that there would be tremendous crises and breakdowns of production. These\nhe regarded as expressing the\nrebellion of the productive\nforces of industry that grew\nup within capitalism against\ncapital itself.\nIn the 20th century we live\nin the epoch of the revolution\nof an international movement\nof the wage-earning class,\nwho represent -the future of\nmodern industry, in that only\nthrough their taking power is\nit possible to bring together\nin a planned way all the developed resources of industry\nand science. Until this takes\nWith the advances made last year by left wing groups in the college there appears\nto have been a proliferation of these groups. There is now a Socialist Society, Communist society, ICPAG, the MarxistjLenist study group, and the Young Socialists\nStudent Society.\nThe latter is responsible for the daily selling of \"Workers' Press\" in the Union\nArch. The Y.S. and Workers' Press are both part of the Trotskyist movement, the\nSocialist Labour League. But who are the Trotskyists and how do they differ from\nthe other groups'? To try and clarify this, Felix conducted an interview with Dr.\nCyril Smith of the Mechanical Engineering Department, which appears here in\nedited form.\nInterviewer: Stephen Giles\nplace capitalism condemns\nthe human race to economic\ncrises, instability, un employ ment, fascism and war of increasing intensity.\nFELIX: What about Trotsky? How does he come in?\nDr. Smith: Lenin made a big development in Marxist\ntheory in that he saw the\nchanges that had taken place\nin Imperialism since the death\nof Marx. It was the highest\nstage of capitalism which led\nto the world wars. Marx\nthought that it was in the advanced countries that the\nworking class would first take\npower but Lenin saw this was\nin aed equate in the 20th century. Trotsky, even more so,\nunderstood that the Russian\nrevolution would be led by\nthe working class, although\nSTUDENT RELIGION I believe in God. The only\nthing is that I must say what\nI mean by that. God has always existed, and He is personal and good. This God has\ncreated the world in which we\nfind ourselves, and created\nman in His own image. This\ndoes not mean that God has\ntwo arms and two legs, but\nrather that man's personality\nis not just an illusion, for it is\nderived from God's personal-it y. As every person is created\nin God's image, each individual is important. This gives\na valid reason for fighting\nevery form of discrimination,\nand for trying to stop any\nform of social injustice.\nNo-one can be content with\nthe world as it is today, for\nthe loneliness, unhappiness,\ngreed and violence in it are\nall too obvious. Any system\nof beliefs must tell us how\nthis happened, and what can\nbe done about it. The Bible\ntells us that when God created\nthe world it was good, and\nwe should note that the word\n'good' has real meaning; it is\nbased on God's character.\nGod gave man the choice of\nobeying Him or rebelling, and\nthis shows that man is not a machine; he is able to decide his own course of ac-tion. The tragedy is that\nman chose to disobey God,\nand ever since has been in\nrebellion against Him. This\nalienation from God has\nbrought alienation between\nmen themselves, whereas\nthere is a God who really\nPeter Stephenson ,a Mech. Eng. postgraduate, writes\nhere on the subject of his religion, the first of several\narticles we hope to print concerning students and their\nvarious attitudes to life. Anyone with strong religious\nviews who wants to give his ^opinion in ]a few hundred\nwords should contact FELIX in the press room or via the\nletter rack.\nexists and who communicates\nwith men. He gives them absolute commands; right and\nwrong are different. Man has\ntrue moral guilt, and all that\nwe want to get rid of in the\nworld stems from this.\nThe answer to man's dilemma is not just better edu-cation, nor revolution, nor\na better standard of living. It\nlies, first and foremost, in\nman's relationship to God,\nyet the man who turns to\nGod must do so on God's conditions. This may seem\nharsh, but remember two\nthings. Firstly, God is your\ncreator, and who are you to\ntell Him what he should do?\nSecondly, remember God's love for you, and all that it\ncost Him. I firmly believe\nthat Jesus Christ is both man\nand God. This is the only\ndescription of Him that fits\nboth the claims that He\nmade and the character of\nHis life. One reason for God\nto become man in Christ\nJesus was that by doing so\nHe could communicate with\nus. There is a second vital\nreason for God becoming\nman, and this is that because to do right is intrinsically part of God's char-act er. He cannot ignore our\nmoral guilt; He must punish to remain self-consistent.\nThe Bible teaches us that\nwhen Christ died, our guilt\nwas somehow transferred to\nHim, and He died for us.\nThat God was prepared to\ngo so far to answer man's need shows how deep is His\nhatred of all that is wrong\nin the world, and how great\nis His love for us.\nGod's terms for man to\nknow Him, and for man's alienation from God to end,\nare these. You must believe\nthat God exists, that He is\npersonal and yet creator, and\nthat Jesus Christ is God.\nYou must acknowledge your\ntrue moral guilt before God.\nYou must believe that Christ\ndied at an actual point in\ntime and space to bear God's punishment for your guilt.\nYou must rely entirely on\nChrist and not expect God to\nacknowledge you or help\nyou because of anything\nthat you do.\nIt is vital to realise how\nmuch is at stake. This is not\na matter that you can ignore.\nChristianity is not just wishful thinking. God was not\ninvented by man to fill man's needs, but there is a God\nwho really exists, and there\nis meaningful communication between God and man.\nChristianity stands or falls\non whether the resurrection\nof Jesus Christ is historical\nfact or not. Christians must\nbe prepared to face the consequences of being proved\nwrong. They must say, with\nSt. Paul, that if you find\nthe body of Christ, then\nthey are all deluded and\nwasting their time.\nA second reason for taking the Bible seriously is\nthat it states that there is\nlife after death. God does\nnot expect people to hope\nagainst reason that death is\nnot the end, but instead He\nshows us that one man, Jesus\nChrist, has already risen\nfrom the dead. The Bible\ngoes on to say that your fate\nin eternity depends on the\nchoices that you make now;\none reason why Christians\nhave gone to such lengths to\ntell others of their faith is\nthat they realise what is at\nstake.\nFinally, don't take all this\ntalk of eternal life as \"pie\nin the sky\". A faith in God\nin the terms that I have described means that you are no\nlonger lost in a world that\nseems meaningless and hos-tile. You find a meaning and\npurpose to life, and a quality of life that cannot be\nfound in any other way.\nthe minority, and it would\nnot be restricted to Russia,\nbut would only be the begining of the process of world\nrevolution.\nIn the Russian revolution\nthe working class did take\npower but in a very backward\ncountry under conditions of\nthe most terrible devastation\nwhen the capitalist powers\ntried to smash the revolution.\nThis meant that the revolution did not spread to the advanced countries. So you had\na stalemate where the revolution survived inside this\nbackward country but capitalism was able to retain\npower in the advanced co un tries.\nUnder these conditions the\nSoviet State began to degen-e rate. Lenin fought against\nthe growth of bureau cr a a cy, a layer of managers, technicians and officials, inside the\nworker's state. He saw it reflected inside his own bol-she vic party in a group which\nbegan to crystallize around\nJosef Stalin.\nAfter Lenin's death, under\nStalin, the bureaucratic layer\nbegan to take control of the\nparty and state. This was reflected in the conception not\nof world revolution but of\nsocialism completely inside\nRussia, which was quite opposed to anything Lenin and\nMarx had talked about.\nThe definition of Trotskyism lies in the fact that Trotsky was the leader of the tendency which fought against\nStalinism. It was the struggle\nto continue Lenin's conception of the Russion revolution\nas part of the world re vol u tion.\nFELIX: So it's really a question of internal bureaucracy\nversus international socialism.\nDr. Smith: Absolutely.\nFELIX : So when in \"Work-ers' Press\" people are denounced as Stalinist, it is because of their bureaucratic\nattitude to Communism.\nDr. Smith: Yes, but I'd like\nto add a bit to that. We call\npeople Stalinist inside the British communist party, who\naren't all bureaucrats, many\nare workers and students.\nThey are however influenced\nby a theoretical outlook\nwhich itself reflects the needs\nof that bureaucracy.\nFELIX: It would seem rather\nunfortunate for you that\nwhen most people talk of\ncommunism they think of\nRussia and Stalin.\nDr. Smith: Yes, it's unfortunate but its no good bemoaning the fact, our task is\nto clean up the name of communism which has been\ndragged in the mud by the\nStalinists and their hangers-on in the Communist Party.\nWe are the continuance of\nthe historical tendency going\nback to Marx, through\nLenin's fight in the Bolshevic\nparty and Trotsky's struggle\nwith Stalin.\nFELIX: About the Young\nSocialists, presumably they\naren't quite the Labour party\nequivalent of the Young Conservatives?\nDr. Smith: The Young\nSocialists Organisation was\nset up as the Labour Party\nyouth movement in 1960.\nThen a big struggle took\nplace inside it against the\npolicies of Gaitskell and later\nWilson. In 1964 those people\nwho supported the policies of\nTrotsky won the majority at\na Y.S. Conference and refused to keep quiet about the\ndangers to the working class\nas Wilson prepared to win\nthe General Election.\nThey were expelled from\nthe Labour Party and then\nconstituted themselves as the\nleadership of an independent\nyouth movement. The lot who\nwere left renamed themselves\nthe Labour Party Young\nSocialists.\nFELIX: So there are two\nparallel Young Socialists\nmovements?\nDr. Smith: Yes.\nFELIX: From talking to\npeople in other left wing\ngroups I get the impression\nthat the Young Socialists are\nrather unpopular and suspect-Why do you think this is?\nDr. Smith: In some circles\nwe are unpopular because we\nfight for our own independent\npolicy. We are not protestors\nagainst the injustice of capitalism, we are revolutionaries\nwho fight to overthrow it.\nThis brings us up against\nmany tendencies inside the\nworkers' movement, no doubt\nwell - intention ed but who\ndon't want to see that hap-pen. We don't like being un-popular, but we're not worried about it. For us our\nprinciples are scientific principles and we wouldn't bend\nthem for anybody, not for\nMr. Wilson, not for Stalin and\nnot for Mr. Tariq Ali.\nWhether you agreed or disagreed with the views\nexpressed on this page, let us know.

I consider his views wrong\nboth on moral and economic\ngrounds.\nIt seems to me outmoded\nto view the world in terms\nof individual nations, each\nseeking only its own good.\nRather should we consider\nourselves part of a world\ncommunity where each bears\nsome responsibility to the\nother.

On moral grounds\nalone I would have thought\nthat we ought to share some\nof our resources; one way\nof doing this is to invite\noverseas students to come\nhere to be trained in skills\nappropriate to alleviating\nthe problems of their own\ncountries.

Why should the\nElders of our Marble Halls\nhave a place away from the\nnoisy rabble\".\nSo it was agreed by the\nmen of the Northlands that\nthey should enter the Halls\nof our Elders and establish\nthemselves there. Then up\nspake Nogbad-the-Aix, say-ing: \"Do not the Elders not\ndesire a place to them-selves?\" \"Segregationalist,\nyouth prejudice!\" ranted the\nLefty Thanes.\n\"After all,\" continued\nNogbad-the-Aix, \"you Lefty\nThanes have places in the\ngreat Halls, where you may\nentertain your friends in\nprivate.\" \"True,\" gasped the\nneutral warriors who had to\nlive away from the great\nHalls. \"Incidentally, do the\nElders want us in their\nHalls?\" Persisted Nogbadthe-Aix. \"That is not im-port ant, we of the Left are\nalways correct; other\nopinions are revisionist and\nanti-social\" chanted the\nwarriors of the Red Guard\nmust be prepared to make\nthis sacrifice.

In the long term,\nthe most efficient way for\nthis country to raise its\nstandard of living is to do\nall it can to encourage\nworld trade. One of the ways\nof doing this is to train\nthese people who will in the\nend be most effective in\nmobil ising the resources of\nthe Third World.

No such advice was\nforthcoming, but instead certain quarters were revelling in\nthe chance to provide destructive criticism of a newspaper\nthat has sometimes tended to take a political stand at variance with their own opinions.\nI refer especially to the President of Mines, who in his\nCouncil report for R.C.S. broadsheet, expressing nothing\nbut his own concern at the extra \u00a3300 grant (awarded to\nFelix at the last Council meeting) in relation to the \" wasted\nfront page and generally poor quality of the last issue \". If\nMr. Barker feels that the front page of the last Felix was\nwasted, then I suggest to him that the column, anonymously\nwritten in the latest Mines Newsletter by Tom Marples (see\nColcutt) was not only a waste of space but a far more\ndangerous waste than the photo, of the Felix Road sign.\nComing from the President of Mines, any argument expressing concern about Felix is made sterile by the fact that\nthis constituent College is notorious for its lack of support\nof the College Newspaper in the form of staff. I speak not\nonly for this year, but also for years previous to this.\nAll this returns me to the present Felix staff shortage. The\nmain result of this shortage is that many items of news,\ntogether with various meetings, are not reported because\nmembers of the staff are elsewhere. There must be many\namongst our readers who, having attended a particular fun c tion, feel that it ought to be reported in Felix. If such people\ncould come along to a Press Meeting on any Tuesday or\nThursday and arrange to report certain meetings for Felix,\nthen the present news-coverage, which is suffering most from\nthe staff shortage, could be greatly improved.\nWorking for Felix can be very satisfying, but only when\nyou are not doing the work of two people.\nFELIX\nNEEDS STAFF, THAT MEANS YOU\nIF YOU WANT TO LEARN, COME TO PRESS MEETINGS,\n12.45 EVERY TUESDAY AND THURSDAY PRESS ROOM,\nUNION TOP FLOOR.\nPresident's Piece\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nPhone 01-589-2963 (Int phone 2881)\nEDITOR: MALCOLM WILLIAMSON\nAssistant Editors: Ian Carr and Tony Kirkham\nNews Editor: Dave Chant\nPhotographic Editor: Simon Hoyle\nBusiness Manager: Ian Quarrinton\nCirculation Manager: Roger Lindsay\nWith: Ian Williams, Steve Giles, John Bowman,\nFrances Campbell, Colcutt, Piers Corbyn, Tony\nSimms, Malcolm Bailey, Andrew \u2014\u2014\u2014,\nand all those who helped in the distribution,\ncollating, and selling of this issue.\nPrinted by: F.

Dept. reps, will\nrepresent views from their\ndepartments on IC council\nand make sure that people\nin departments know what is\ngoing on on council and in\nthe discussions with the\n\" Authorities\" and other\nbodies, they will organise\nmeetings of their year reps.,\nstaff, PG's, etc., or the whole\ndept., to discuss any matters\nof interest:\u2014 e.g. refreshment facilities, staff/student\nrelations, course broadening,\nsocial responsibility, car ni val, examinations, etc.. Take\npart in the elections and use\ndept. reps!\nThe IC/USK bureau is\nnow in 8 Princes Gardens\u2014\nbring along addresses of\n(non-racialist) digs, flats,\nbeds its, etc.\nCo-adult\ncommunity\nThe Union has now clearly stated its views on a number of very important topics.\nFor representation and participation in decisions on\npolicies (rather than details)\nwe have asked for 5 representatives on the Board of\nStudies and do not want to\nbe excluded from discussions concerning us on any\ncommittee. The Union will\norganize a meeting to form\nan ICRC, the decisions of\nthis body could be far reaching \u2014 because of its representative ness. Concerning the Architectural Association merger we\nhave stated that we want\nour say in the negotiations\nand that their level of participation should not be reduced merely to match ours.\nFor Senior Common\nRooms we have stated that\nwe want them open to students in the same way as our\ncommon room is open to\nothers. Council will be drawing up a list of certain non-academic staff posts in\nwhich we should definitely\nhave a say.\nIn all these matters (Re-presentation, ICRC, A A/ ICST, SCR's, and non-academic staff) the Union\nhas adopted policies consistent with the idea of evolving a co-adult community. I hope the \" Authorities \" will\ntake us seriously and respond favourably \u2014 the\nalternative to the idea is\nsomething worse than the\n\" degree - factory \" from which we want to escape.\nIvory towered\nOfficials\nStudent Presidents, etc.\nof students Unions were\nrecently criticised (concern-ing lodgings) for passing\n' high-principled judgments'\nfrom their ' ivory towers'\ncausing hardship to students\nother than themselves. These\ncriticisms are accompanied\nby a curious wave of incoherent nihilism.\nThe ' ivory towers ' criticism is of course valid,\nthough it does not mean that\ntheir presidents' decision\nwas wrong. Any pyramid\nstructure might allow officials to do incorrect things\nin the name of people whom\nthey represent. Someone\nonce said \" correct ideas\ncome from social practice \",\nwhich in the context meant\nthings like students must\nwork with peasants on the\nland, etc., etc., and in our\ncontext means that student\nofficials can only be aware\nof the general ideas of students if involved in student\nlife. So make sure they are!\nCOLCUTT\nSo it did happen after all. 400 drowsy faces staring blankly\nat Lord Penney as he preached the gospel of double disc ip line. If ever a speech showed the dangers of allowing a college to be set up without an arts faculty, this was it. No\ninspiration, no life, not even any scientific logic. Ebdon\nshowed this up perfectly. If we think of modern societies\nwith unwritten laws like Nazi Germany and Colonels' Greece,\nthe Rector's arguments become spurious. And if he seriously\nthinks we may get a worse Rector than him, then I suggest\nhe invites the Rev. Ian Paisley to succeed him.\nAnd how about the new trendy Corbyn and his cell-mate\nGuy? Their puerile activities must remind old hands of the\ndays of Phillips and Lack. Each puts up notices wh i oh the\nother tears down and each boasts of how he can \" handle \"\nthe other (whatever that means). If these two would like to\nfight in unison for Union policy (as expressed at the now\nfrequent Union meetings) such policy would stand a much\nbetter chance of being implemented.\nMorphy Day will soon be with us again. Already the\nthugs of those great institutions, the constituent colleges,\nare planning their typical afternoon of hooliganism on the\ntowpath at Putney. As on previous occasions, the missiles,\nsupposedly rotten fruit, will in fact be far more solid, perhaps causing serious injury just like last year when an unfortunate IC student nearly lost the sight of one eye. When\nthe fun is over, the return journey to IC will leave the tubes\na state which would do justice to any football crowd.\nin\nThis all in the sacred name of constituent college rivalry.\nAlready the drinking habits of the inmates of the Union\nare with us once again. Valuable Union property was destroyed after a fresher's dinner and Union officials were\ntotally unable to control those responsible. The Union Executive must impose more rigorous penalties on those who\nabuse its property other than an ineffectual few weeks ban\non using Union facilities. Also there are more stories about\nirregularities in the operation of the bars. A duty officer\nwas severely abused when he tried to break up a private\ndrinking party behind the Union bar. At this rate, how long\nbefore we lose our licence, and the Rugby club moves down\nto Southside permanently?\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATES\nINTHE\nPROBATION AND AFTER-CARE SERVICE\nIf you are concerned about people, would you like to offer a professional service\nto the community and face the challenge of helping offenders and their families? The\nprobation and after-care service offers real opportunities for young men and women\ngraduates. This is demanding but satisfying work which calls for an unusually high\ndegree of initiative and personal responsibility if effective help is to be given to a wide\nvariety of people. Training before and after entry helps the new officer to develop his\nskill and confidence in dealing with difficult problems of human relationships.\nCareer prospects are good and there are opportunities for work connected with\nresearch, training and administration and for second ment to prisons for experience of\nwork in institutions.\nThere are vacancies for trained probation officers in most parts of England and\nWales. Training combines academic and practical work, and lasts between seventeen\nmonths and two years according to the course chosen. If, however, your degree is in\nsocial studies or allied subjects you can complete training in less than a year.\nStudents taking a professional course for probation and after-care work will be\ntreated as trainee employees of the service and paid a salary. Graduates will enter the\ntrainee scale at a minimum of \u00a3930.\nAfter appropriate training graduates enter the probation officer salary scale at\nnot less than \u00a31,080 increasing to \u00a31,600. Officers working in the London area receive\nan addition of \u00a390 a year. Senior Probation Officers' salaries rise to \u00a32,015; the salaries\nof higher grades range up to \u00a33,320 according to area (\u00a33,830 in Inner London).\nFor fuller information write or telephone:\nSTANLEY RATCLIFFE\nUniversity Liaison Officer\nINNER LONDON PROBATION AND AFTER-CARE AREA\nTelephone: 584 3611\n\n"

The\nmeeting was then dispersed;\na non-event perhaps, but\nentertaining, although it is\ndoubtful who was entertained the most, the audience\nor the contestants.\nScientists and the World\nThe time for electing Mr.\nICWA came around again\nlast week, and five happy (?)\nmembers of the male\nmajority of LC. were\nparaded bare-kneed before\nmost of I.C.'s female con-tin gent. First in line was Tony\nRanger, who, the audience\nwas assured, was fully\nguaranteed for the rest of\nthe year. He was followed\nby Chris Holden, resplendent in green shorts, string\nvest and tail-coat. Dave\nHobden as Chris' proposer\ninvited members of the\naudience to come and feel\nhis nominee's knees to check\ntheir authenticity,\nSteve Buttling, proposing\nDennis Taylor, made a very\ntelling point in his can di date's favour by reminding\nthe audience of Dennis'\nuniqueness in the com pet i tion, all the other entrants\nbeing men. Nevertheless,\nDennis duly dropped his\njeans to disprove this and\nreveal his knees, only losing\nhis composure in the light of\na camera flashgun.\nAlan Morris decided to\nHow much sponsored research goes on in IC, and of\nwhat kind? This was one of\nthe questions which arose\nfrom a talk given by Mrs.\nHilary Rose, editor of the\n\"Newsheet\" for the British\nSociety for Social Responsibility in Science, to a group\nof students and a few staff\nat the College.\nThe Society was formed in\nthe 1960's when it was felt\nthat few scientists were facing the responsibility of their\nwork.\nMrs. Rose said that she\nrespected someone like Lord\nPenney, who decided that\nhis working on the bomb\nwas a proper and responsible\naction, rather than someone\nwho refused to examine the\neffects of their work.\nMrs. Rose told us how,\nfrom a herbicide developed\nfor agricultural use, a defoliant was produced which\nis now being used to destroy\ncrops in Vietnam.\nSocial scientists have their\nwork similarly corrupted.\nSociologists working in the\nUSA on social change found\nthat their work was CIA\nsponsored with a view to\nsuppressing revolution in\npoor countries.\nThe Society's committee\ninvestigating the effects of\nCS gas produced results\nslightly different from the\nofficial version. The Establishment is generally unwilling to give up an established\nweapon \u2014 viable criticism\nmust come from outside, for\nexample the British and\nAmerican nuclear bomb\nauthorities once said that\nradiation was harmless.\nThe Society feels that research is not something\nwhich should continue in a moral vacuum. It should be\nrelated to the best interests\nof society.\nAt UC, a survey had been\nconducted into the sponsored research there. Mrs.\nRose felt that the same\nthing could usefully be done\nat IC, and that students\nshould discuss with staff\nwhat was being done, and\nwhy.\nIt was decided to hold a meeting in about a month's time to discuss the setting\nup of a group for Kensington and Chelsea.\nThe adjourned Union\nmeeting, still basking in unchallenged quo racy, continued last Thursday and the\n400 or so present were not\ndisappointed in waiting for\nLord Penney's talk on\ndouble discipline. The Rector opened with a quotation from a past master of\nBalliol College (Oxford):\n\" I'm the master of this College what I don't know isn't knowledge\"; Lord Penney\nthen went on to remind his\naudience that had he been\nRector some decades ago his\nacademic power would have\nbeen absolute, and followed\nwith a threat to dismiss Mr.\nCorbyn! The Rector envisaged a disciplinary board\nconsisting of numbers of staff\nand students, but pointed out\nthat there may be some\nopposition to the scheme. It\nwas not, he claimed, necessary to formulate a list of\noffences, but rather a procedural code to deal with\nsuch offences. To illustrate\nhis position, Lord Penney\nproduced a copy of a recent\nWhitehall report, which advocated a strict central disciplinary body for Colleges\nof higher education; to this\nhe was strictly opposed. He\nappreciated however that\nstudent views changed from\nyear to year, and that in implementing the proposals the\ncollege would have to rely\non its own sense of com-m unity, Turning specifically to the\ntopic of double discipline,\nthe Rector was adamant in\nhis view that stating whether\nor not there should be\ndouble discipline ought to be\navoided. Reaffirming his intention that the responsibility for disc i line should\nbe shared by staff and\nstudents, Lord Penney gave\ntwo extreme examples. First\nhe gave the hypothetical\ncase of the drunken student\nand secondly that of the\nstudent drug peddler, pointing out the obvious great\ndifferences between the two.\nThe Rector reassured his\naudience, and himself, that\nthe serious offence may never\noccur, and that each case\ncoming to his notice would\nbe considered on its own\nmerits if and when it\nhappened. In conclusion, he\nrepeated his intention that it\nwas best not to write down\nwhether there should or\nshould not be such rules and\ntook his seat to appreciative\napplause.\nThe President of the\nUnion then threw the subject open for questions and\ncomments. Nick de Klerk\nsaid that the college was not\na community, rather an in-st it uti on, and should therefore rely solely on the law\nof the land. Les Ebdon\nclaimed that the Rector was\narguing for the most flexible\nsystem and that in such a system the student representatives would have little protection from bureaucracy.\nHe argued that the law\" of\nthe land was adequate, and\nthat he openly feared a vigilante society. Replying\nto the floor, the Rector\nstated that he was in favour\nof student powers, but that\nthese would not be achieved\novernight. In answer to other\nquestions, Lord Penney said\nthat all students on the committee would have full\npowers, and would be elected\nto the committee by the\nstudents themselves. He\nclosed his reply by saying\nthat he wanted the committee to make all decisions thus\nremoving responsibility from\nhis own shoulders.\nOther matters at the meeting included the President's report, in which he stated\nthat the new USK Lodgings\nBureau had already been set\nup, and that the college\nauthorities would give\nfinancial support on a pound\nfor pound basis. He also\nmaintained that a letter concerning undergraduate access to the senior common\nrooms had been sent to the\nRector, and would be posted\naround the college in the\nnear future, Mr. Corbyn then\ninformed the meeting of\ncurrent negotiations about\nthe merger of the AA and IC\nunions in August '70. A list\nof IC representatives on\nULU committees was given\nto the meeting; there being\nno questions the President\nquickly moved on to the\nmotions.\nThe first motion concerned\nunion representation on college committees and was proposed by Les Ebdon who\nopenly expressed profound\ndisappointment with the\nRector's reply. He began by\nproposing 5 representatives\nto sit on the board of\nStudies, claiming that student\nrepresentation was essential\nto any academic community.\nHe went on to say that the\ngrowth of commuter universities, such as IC, presented\nproblems due to an abundance of students and quoted\nthe Physics department of IC\nas an example. It was because of these numbers that\nparticipation was essential to\nthe ethos of a university. Receiving no opposition, this\nfirst part was passed un-a nimo us ly. Mr. Ebdon continued by proposing the formation of an experimental\nIC representative council on\nwhich representatives of all\nmembers of college (in clu d ing technical staff) would sit.\nHe realised that this was not\nso much revolutionary but\nwould he hoped have a far-reaching effect. Once more\nthe motion was passed un-a nimo us ly. The president then proposed that the union should\naccept the list of topics put\nforward for discussion by the\nQuinquennium Working Party. After a few minor\namendments the list was\nunanimously accepted. Mr.\nCorbyn then appealed for\nvolunteers from the floor to\nassist with the further compiling of the report. No more\nmotions were forthcoming\nand following were 4 minor\nitems of information.\nAfter this the Presdent promised a motion on double\ndiscipline and closed the\nmeeting.\n\n"

The U.L. U. Presidents Council decision\nto strike racialist landladies\nfrom the U.L. lodgings bureau stands or falls on two\nmain points; firstly, is the lot\nof the coloured student in\nLondon improved? Secondly,\nare the landladies concerned\nfilled with contrition, are\ntheir prejudices dissolved?\nThe answer to both is a patently obvious 'no' and yet\nthe Union 'powers that be'\nstill continue to defend the\naction on the grounds of one\nmoral principle; that racial\ndiscrimination must be\nfought at all times and at\nall costs.\nLet us look at this moral\nprinciple in terms of hous-ing. The Race Relations Act\nsought to improve, among\nother things, the housing\nsituation of the coloured im-migrant, but it placed the\nlandlord in the ironic situation that he could turn\naway the long-haired hippy\nin favour of the clean-shaven\nwhite, yet was obliged to\naccept the immigrant under\nthe threat of prosecution if\ndiscrimination could be es-tabl is he d. We do not need\nto be Powellites to recognise\na certain element of encroachment on the in divi dual's rights. The proposition that the freedom of the\nindividual encompasses the\nfreedom to discriminate may\nnot be tenable to some but\nlet us recognise the difference\nbetween negative discrimination and positive perse cu tion.\nThe argument, then, is\nthat the moral principle con-cern ed, specifically applied\nto housing, is not sufficiently\nwidely held to constitute a defence for the continuing\nlodgings position. Let us also\nrecognise who is doing the\nfavour. Landladies who let\nrooms to students, in favour\nof the more lucrative young\nprofessional type, invariably\ndo so because they feel a certain amount of sympathy\nfor the students' financial\nsituation. To be told, by the\nstudents she has endeavour ed to help over the years, who\nshe must let into her own\nhouse, places her in an intolerable position and she\npredictably raises two fin-gers.\nWe should face the facts;\nit is a seller's market; no\nmatter how impassioned, we\nare in no position to dictate\nterms. We should admit that\na mistake has been made\nand attempt a restoration of\nthe status quo; re-channel\nour idealistic zeal into more\nefficient protest with a little\nmore prior consideration for\nthe well-being of the community at large as well as for\nthe minority for whom we\nfight. Racial prejudice is\nbased on fear and no Government, no University\nUnion, will dispel that fear\nby legislation or in timid a tion.\nYours,\nSTUART SENIOR,\nE.E. P.G. CAPITALIST CRISIS\nDear Sir,\nTo understand the meaning of the motion at the\nUnion meeting of 9th October concerning the Chairman\nof GEC/EE we have to look\nat the whole situation of\nInternational Capitalism.\nThe so-called rational is a ton of EE/GEC is a symptom of the international\ncrisis of capitalism. As the\ncrisis deepens and the greed\nfor profit increases, more and\nmore attacks are made not\nonly on the British working\nclass but on that class on an\ninternational scale.\nWitness the events in\nFrance in May 1968, so far\ncompletely unresolved and in\nfact insoluble by the bankrupt French Bourgoisie; the\nnear governmental collapse\nin Italy as the wave of unofficial strikes continues and\nthe spreading of these strikes\nto so called \"stable\" West\nGermany.\nDear Sir,\nI am both worried and\ndisgusted at the attitudes expressed by \"George X\" in\nyour last edition of Felix.\nHis arguments are based on\na series of false assumptions\nwhich I shall now attempt to\ndeal with, one by one.\nHe argues that there is not\nenough room in our universities for our own students.\nIn the first place I should\nlike to point out that many\nscience and engineering faculties across the country\nhave great difficulty in filling\ntheir places with suitable\ncandidates, even more so\nnow when so many schoolchildren are turning their\ninterests towards the arts\nrather than the sciences. Mr.\nX has tacitly assumed that\nthe academic standards of\nthe universi ies have maintained parity over the last\nfew years. Again, this is not\nture. Before the big exp an son the usual entry requirement was three A levels,\nnow that we have many\nmore places it is feasible to\nThe only answer the capitalist class has to the crisis\nis given at English Electric\n\u2014 more unemployment and\nshort-time work.\nNor does the Lincoln case\nalter the argument; certainly\nmore work can be given to\nreprieve the Lincoln factory\nbut only at the expense of\nthe redundancies elsewhere,\nwhich have so far claimed\nthe jobs of 17,000 workers.\nThere is no solution to the\ncrisis, ignoring Enoch Powell's hysterical outbursts\nand sewer-rat politics, other\nthan the taking of power by\nthe working class led by a revolutionary party built on\na firm foundation of Marxist\ntheory and united against\nthe treacherous Wilson gov-ern ment, its accomplices in\nthe Trade Union bureau-c racy, and the internationalist bankers who support it.\nALAN LAFFERTY.\nconsider people with only\ntwo A levels. If space were\nat a premium, as Mr. X maintains, the universities\nwould not have lowered their\nstandards.\nA very important factor\nis the grades obtained at the\nA level. For example, a student with two grade Es\nwanting to do mathematics\nwould not be accepted, not\nthrough any lack of room\non the part of the university,\nbut through a lack of ability on the part of the app li cant. The UCCA clearing\nscheme attempts to place\nthose candidates with the\n\" minimum requirements \"\ninto a university. The reason why this is not always\nsuccessful is that many universities are not prepared to\naccept students with bare\npasses. The minimum requirements of different universities are in no way uni-form, another point Mr. X appears to have overlooked.\nDoes Britain benefit from\noverseas students? I would\nsay yes. The cross-fert i lisa tion of ideas that necessarily\nensues in discussion with students of different back-grounds, different ways of\napproaching a problem, can\nonly be of benefit to all con-cern ed. Contact between foreign students helps to develop understanding between\nnations and serves to create\na political climate in which\nrational discussion can replace irrational prejudice.\nThat British students benefit greatly from their studies\nin other countries cannot be\ndenied, it is surely common\ncourtesy to extend the same\nopportunities to foreign students in this country.\nMr. X bemoans the fact\nthat many overseas students\nreturn to their country on\ncompletion of their studies.\nAs far as the underdeveloped countries are concerned\nI would regard the return of\nqualified scientists and technologists as the most practical form of economic aid\nthat we can give. For the\ndeveloped countries, students\nare generally exchanged on\na one-to-one basis, hence the\nnumber of places occupied\nremain the same.\nI do not accept the contention that eligible Britons\nare being denied places.\nTo return to my example,\na foreign student with two\ngrade As would be accepted\nfor a mathematics course,\nwhereas a British student\nwith two grade Es would\nnot. It would clearly be\nfatuous for the British student to claim that the foreign student were occupying\n\"his\" place, if the foreign\nstudent were not there, the\nplace would be vacant!\nIn conclusion I should like\nto express my distaste that\nthat George X did not sign\nhis full name. In my op in ion, an anonymous letter to\na newspaper is a form of\nintellectual cowardice, and\ndoes not deserve to be\nprinted.\nYours sincerely,\nBRIAN HAINS\nGeophysics P.G.( IC Academic Affairs\nOfficer)\nHALDANE CRITICISED\nDear Felix,\nHaving served on the socalled Haldane Library\nUnion Committee (student)\nfor one year, I am possessed\nof the urge to communicate\nmy impressions to your readers and particularly Haldane\nLibrary users.\nThe main (only?) function of Committee members\nis to work once a fortnight\nat the Issue desk during the\nlunch hour, and in exchange\nfor this they are bribed;\nbeing allowed to borrow an\nunlimited number of books\nfor an indefinite period! The\nstudent committee has no\nsay whatsoever in buying\npolicy and library affairs and\nfor that matter has no constructive role to play at all.\nIt would make no difference\nif this committee were dissolved and lunch-time volunteers called for! This would\nalso be a good deal more\nhonest, as no false expectations will be aroused in con-struct ive/ creative types like\nme !\nFortunately the boredom\nof committee meetings last\nyear was at least relieved by\nthe entertainment provided\nby the chairman, for which\n1 express my gratitude.\nKUMAR DAVID.\nElect. Eng.\n\"George X\" Replies:\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Mr. Hains'\nletter, I must concur in general with some of his points.\nIn my first letter I did not\nhave the space to give to\nexceptions like reciprocal\nagreements with other countries and the fact that some\nUniversities do not have\nenough Science and Technology applicants. However, in\nthe specific case of IC, this\nis a very difficult College to\ngain admittance to and the\nengineering departments even\nset their own tests to thin\ndown the candidates, so there\ncan hardly be a shortage of\napplicants !\nAs for the lowering of\nstandards, he says that 2 E's at A level are not good\nenough; they are however\n2 A levels. The Compendium of Requirements asks\nfor 2 A levels; if the authorities consider this too low,\nthey should raise the require-ment s, not add that they\nneed two grade A's after the\napplications have been taken\nin! Further, although the\nintellectual cross-fertilisation\nof ideas could happen, in\npractice it does not take\nplace; overseas students congregate together and find it\nnecessary to have their own\ncommittee; this is hardly\npromoting integration.\nI agree that I should have\nused my full name, but my\nletter was not anonymous\n(of unknown name, unknown authorship) but was\nprinted under a nom-de-plume, as no-one would have\nknown me anyway.\nJUSTIN C.

Chris\nvisited America to see how the other half lives, and here he comments on the most publicised recent American Film.\nNew York, New York What is New York ? A city\nof individuals yes but a lonely city, probably the\nloneliest on earth. A place where you can die and nobody\nwould notice except maybe some buckweed rolled in from\nTexas. People talk incessantly to themselves, slouch around\noblivious to the world at large. New Yorkers must be the\nmeanest looking people on earth. They're ugly, misshapen\nand deformed. They never laugh, and you're lucky if they'll\nspare you a glance. Take care, they'll con you out of your\nlast dime.\nFor all its failings it still has a personality all its own.\nIts theatres, its movie houses, its pseudo-intellectual atmosphere and its liberal laws attract hopeful young studs like\nJoe Buck, hot in pursuit of a quick lay. One wonders all\nthrough the films why he picked New York and not L.A. or San Francisco.\nPoor old Joe, like an innocent out of school just waiting\nto be trapped. He sees the Manhattan skyline like the pot\nof gold at the end of the rainbow, but it's not long before\nthe stark face of reality catches up with him. He has to\npay the bell boy and then finds he needs a quarter for the\nT.V. set. But he still isn't disillusioned and after laying some\nworn out broad in her Park Avenue apartment with the\nkind help of her dog he falls under the influence of Ratso\nas he is affectionately known.\nJoe tells him how he wants to be a hustler and Ratso\nconvinces him that he needs a manager. After an unhappy\nincident with a religious pervert, Joe begins to realise what\nNew York without money and friends means.\nBy chance one day while sitting in a coffee bar they\nget an invitation to some sort of psychoanalytical party.\nThey go along and while Ratso helps himself to the food,\nJoe true to his innocent looks accepts a drag without realising that it's loaded. Ups and downs abound and everyone\nlooks like they came out of a comic strip. Unreal you might\nthink \u2014 no not in New York.\nEven stewed out of his mind Joe still manages to pick\nup a rich married high society woman and persuades her\nto hire him. After playing cat and mouse for a bit he screws\nhell out of her, so much to her satisfaction that the next\nmorning she fixes up appointments for him with some of her\nfriends. Then just as his future seems assured . . . .\nOne of the best things the film does is to illustrated in\na rather out of the way fashion the problems of the down\nand outs. For the unskilled, life is a succession of lines waiting for jobs as dishwashers, floor sweepers or lavatory\ncleaners and for Ratso and Joe it's not even that. They have\nto make their way through petty thefts and degrading\nrituals. The film brilliantly portrays the relationship between\nJoe and Ratso and during one sequence in the graveyard\ngives us an insight into the complex character that is Ratso.\nAnyone who has worked and lived in Manhattan, which\nis New York to most people, will be deeply moved by this\nfilm and will realise that the message is not in the actions\nof Joe, although certainly these are important, but in the\ninhumanity of cities. We live in a big city too. It might be\nas well to look around sometime.\nMore and more of the films coming out of the states\nright now are being made away from Hollywood and L.A. New York is now the in place for filming. Two of the best\nfilms currently in London were made there. Actors seem to\nfind more freedom there and feel much more in touch with\nreality or at least this is the opinion of Ali Magraw,\ncaptivating star of \"Goodbye Columbus.\" \"Midnight Cowboy\" could have easily been made on a set, but would have\nsuffered considerably for it. Instead it turns out to be another triumph at the hands of John Schlessinger and stars\nDustin Hoffman as Ratso and John Voight as Joe Buck.\nAnyone who has seen The Graduate will be surprised to\nsee Dustin in this new and completely different role. He\ndemonstrates his great versatility as an actor, something\nwhich is all too rare in these days of soap operas and typecast films. However he cannot resist slipping into his more\nfamiliar comic self as he hobbles down the streets.\nThe use of flashbacks is becoming more and more common\nfollowing the great success of \"If\", but I wonder if it really\nhelps the audience or just confuses them. In some of the\nsequences the color tones were kept the same and one\nhardly knew whether the action was a reflection, actually\nhappening or about to happen.\nI liked this film and highly recommend it to anyone who\nhas ever felt lonely or depressed, because it gives a very\nmoving tone picture of loneliness in a city and pays a lot of\nattention to detail.\nThe Phoenix\nMan\nChris Lewis is an engineer;\nChris Lewis is an artist.\nSuch a contradiction in\nforms of identity might suggest that the Editor of\nPhoenix is also a schizophrenic but for the fact that\nboth identities exist at one\nand the same time. Lewis\nthe engineer is only made\ncredible by the fact that he\nis on a good Upper Second\nin the third year of his Mech.\nEng. course, but Lewis the\nartist is amply substantiated\nby the last issue of Phoenix,\nwhich made a complete\nbreak with the traditionally\nturgid magazine and replaced it with a product\nworthy of definition as a literary magazine.\nChris is at present work-LAMLEY'S A Mi;\nBO\n| PAPE\nY STATIONERY\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 ing on the next issue of\nPhoenix, which is due out\nearly next term. The theme\nfor this issue is Underground; was chosen because\na glut of poems falling into\nthis category was received\nfor the last issue, and is designed to include topics ranging from bus kers to cemeteries, from resist en ce groups\nto Soho. The theme is not\nexclusive, however, and any\nsubject matter is acceptable,\nthe only criterion being\nquality.\nAlthough all the articles\nfor the previous Phoenix\nwere commissioned, Chris\nfeels that there are many\npeople who ought to have\ntheir work published, but\ndo not do so for some reason or other. He was himself once wary of having\nanything published, for he\nfelt self-conscious about presenting himself (in the form\nof his writing) before a large\naudience. He also considers\nthat many people who write\npoetry feel that they are losing some of its intimate personal value if it is placed before anyone else to read,\nthis he would deny, again\nhaving passed through much\nthe same phase himself.\nThe function of Phoenix\nto Chris is to give an opportunity to people who\nhave the ability to write to\ndo so, and he feels it is\nimportant for any artist to\nbe judged critically by as\nlarge an audience as pos-sib le. Chris feels that although Phoenix should\nseek to entertain those who\nbuy it, its importance also\nlies in the presentation of\npoints of view which may\nbe alien to the pseudo\nscientific culture preached\nby the academic community\nhere at I.C. Phoenix also\nprovides an outlet for students who are here by mis-take; the poetry editor of\nlast year has now graduated\nfrom Phoenix to an Arts\ndegree course at Manchester University.\nPhoenix is hindered, as\nare all artistically orientated\nproductions at I.C., by the\nfact that engineers, and to\na lesser extent scientists,\ntend to be conservative in\ntheir outlook, whereas at\nthe present time artists\nhave to fight for a future.\nWhereas engineers have a ready made slot to fit into\nin society, and which they\nare prepared to defend,\nartists are constantly seeking a different form of society which would provide\nthem with some form of\nniche. In this case, the\nEditor feels that Phoenix\nwill be fulfilling a purpose\nif it causes people to understand just why situations\nlike those at L.S.E. do\narise.\nAs a final word of advice to anyone who may\nhave had thoughts of writing for Phoenix, Chris\npoints out that H.G. Wells,\nonce a student at I.C., managed to make a name as an\nauthor despite a scientific\neducation. Although arts\nstudents are helped in their\nwriting by a continuous\ncriticism of their work, and\ndemonstrably greater powers\nof imagination, Chris would\nremind us that imagination\nis rooted in reality.\nWestbrook at I.C. Preview of Jazz Club Concert\nApart from providing free\nentertainment on Sunday\nevenings, the IC Jazz club\nalso has the temerity to hire\nprofessional groups and\ncharge a modest fee for\npeople to hear them. The\nfirst such group, appearing\nin the former top Union re-fec. next Wednesday, October 29, is the Mike Westbrook Septet.\nIt was this group, with a few changes in personnel,\nthat held the Saturday night\nresidence at Ronnie Scott's old place for a couple of\nyears until the lease expired,\nand almost single-handed\nbreathed new life into the\ncurrently flourishing British\nmodern jazz scene.\nThe band's very individual\nidentity is based on the compositions of its leader and\nrather reticent pianist, who\na couple of months ago was\nvoted the composer most\nworthy of deserving wider\nrecognition in a Downbeat\nmagazine poll. Westbrook's arrangements, like those of\nEllington, Mingus, Sun Ra,\netc. are tailored to the individual musicians in his\nband, and tend to be ex c it ing, colourful, and somehow\nfaintly nostalgic. Thus the\nshort, slightly tongue-in-cheek theme \"The Few\"\nfrom his LP \"Release\" immediately evokes everyone's favourite Battle of Britain\nfilm, while the arrangements\nof \"Flying Home\" and\n\"Can' Take my Eyes off\nYou\" are both totally contemporary and affectionately\nretrospective.\nThe band's soloists are\nsuperb, Now that John Surman has left Britain to show\nthe rest of the world how to\nplay baritone, the band's star soloist is Mike Osborne,\nwho, no longer dominated\nby his former front line part-ner, has in the last couple of\nmonths become a world\nclass alto saxophonist, as\nanyone who has heard his\ntrio (hopefully appearing at\nIC later in the year) will\ntestify.\nThe rest of the group will\nprobably consist of Malcolm\nGriffiths, a shouting trom-bon is t; the Boris Karloff of\nthe tenor saxophone \u2014\nGeorge Khan, late of Pete\nBrown's Battered Ornaments; trumpeter Dave Holdsworth; bassist Harry\nMiller, and drummer Alan\nJaxkson an invigorating\nevening is guaranteed for all.\nBob Davenport.\n\n"
