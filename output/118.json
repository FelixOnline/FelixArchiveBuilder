    "content": "z FELIX Tony Hodgson was b am in Stocktonon-Tees, j nd has spent most of his life in Harrogate. He o a me to R.C.S. to\nstudy chemistry in 1955, a raw youth\nfrom the Yorkshire backwoods, and has\nnot yet recovered from the shock of\nfinding himself a well-known figure\nin college life. He is undoubtedly a man of many\nparts, his interests extending from\nathletics to Education, and including,\nsurprisingly enough, chemistry and the\nhistory of science.\nThe Hodgson musical tradition (his\nmother teaches the piano, and his grandfather was the original \"bloody organist\"\nof the well-known bar song ) produced\nin Tony an interest and appreciation of\nmusic at an early age, when he learnt\nto play the alto-sax, five-string guitar\nand the piano, and was reserve clarinetist for the National Youth Orchestra*\nTony played for the I.C. traditional\ngroup during his first two years here,\noccupying the post of Jazi Club president las* year, and at present plays\nclarinet in a modern quartet. He says\nthat he prefers Brubeck to Barber, and\nBach to Brubeck.\nTony's interest in music is better\nknown than his interest in sport. He\nwas, however, opening bat for his school\nfirst eleven, and secretary of the\nschool tennis club. He has run for the\nI.C. second cross-country team., once\ngetting lost in Richmond Park during a race- in fact \"the only person I know\nwho has ever got lost there un intention ally.\nAs a member of the Mountaineering\nClub, and la3t year's equipment off ioe r, he has had a chequered career (so has\nthe equipment!). He started climbing at\nthe age of fourteen and by the time he\ncame to I.C. had had no little experience in rock climbing in the Lakes.\nPenninos and Skye. During his first\nsummer here he went to the Alps with\nthe Earakoram training party, and last\nsummer was on the I.C. Norwegian Expedition. Of tl\u00bbe latter he remembers\nlittle. After less than a fortnight\nof o limb ing be fell some sixty feet\nsustaining:\na compound fracture of the left tibia\nand fibula\na complicated fracture of the right\nfemur\na coll is fracture of the right radius\nfracture of the nose, front teeth,\nupper Jaw and left eyebrow\nand a chip off ts* old pelvis\n- he also broke a few banes.\nThe next twenty weeks were spent\npleasantly on his back in Narvik hospital and St. George's comparing the\nvirtues? of Norwegian and English\nnurses. He also learnt a few phrases\nof coarse Norse. Expressions such as:\n\"Jeg ha de bare bra\" - I' mall right\nJack.\n\"Vil du to mme meg flask e?\" It's full!\n\"Jeg vile ls ke du for fj or tende tag.\"\nare useful for any climber intending\nto have an accident in Scandinavia.\nSince the accident Tony has put\nhis right foot forward(his right leg\nbeing eighteen inches longer than his\nleft) and has never looked back.\n(Physiotherapy, however, is slowly\neliminating this feu lt.) He hopes to\nstart o limb ing again in July.\nPerhaps Tony's most active interest at the moment is in writing. He\nwas Social Editor cf Phoenix last year,\nand is now, as Editor, concerned with\nits modernisation in line with his\nneurotic liking for ta schist art which\none of his contemporaries, a well-known but un publishable poet, has\ndescribed as \"The blue-black blobs of\npseudo-nothingness.\"\nTory, himself, is subject to\nspasmodic attacks of poetry, and is\ncompiling \"Anthony's Anthology of\nbad verse I like!\"\nHis other activities include the\nvice-presidency of R.C.S.( despite his\nbaritone voice), the Onion Library\nand General Studies oom mitte es, and\nthe Chairmanship of S. C.C. Next year he hopes to do research\nin e he vd s try^ nd some more writing. Long\nmay his productiveness continue.\nCom* and hear the\nMASS IN B MINOR( J.S.

    "content": "\\ CLUB REVIEW/ It is fitting this term to writs an\na ooo unt of the Musical Society for at\nthe moment we are witnessing an unprecedented interest in music ma king\nthroughout the College.\nOur activities may he divided into\nfive groups. The Choir, Orchestra,\nGramophone Library, Gallery Parties and\nLunch Time Recitals, claiming a membership of between 150 - 200.\nI.C. Choir is better known outside\nk he College than in it, a reproach we\nhope will be rectified on March 12th when we are to give Bach's Mass in B minor in y ii een Alexandra's House.\nthis is the Choir's most ambitious\nwork yet attempted, and we are proud\nto announce that Yfrah Neaman will lead\nthe Orchestra. The leading solo trumpet\nwill be George Eskdale. Dr. Brown is not the person to allow his choir to\nlag behind these celebrities and has\nwelded the varied talents of the members\ninto an excellent team, We often hear\nthe argument \"\nWhy hear amateurs in London?\" - If you can tell the difference\nbetween the present choir and profession-als, you are likely to known enough about\nmusic to oo mein any case.\nThe College Orchestra she wed in its performance a fortnight ago that it has\nimproved a great deal over the last\nyear end the lively music of \"the Mi ka do should enable them to she w their talents\non March 17 - 20th. The Gramophone Library is at present hardly able to oop e with its many\ncustomers. We hope to expand it when\nspace and money permit.\nGallery Parties are open to all members of Imperial College, whether members of the Musical Society or not. If their popularity increases we will be\nable to take over the gallery at Cevent\nGarden or Sadlers Wells;nearly half the\ngallery audience for Rigoletto last\nWednesday were from Imperial College and\nwe had to turn students away.\nFinally our Lunch Time Recitals\nwhich fip mr in the General Studies programme have Just passed their 200th performance.\nThese recitals started before General Studies were heard of and have continued ever since. The Musical Society\nis grateful for the opportunity of bringing some of Britain's foremost performers\nto Imperial College. We only wish more\npeople would avail themselves of the\nchance to hear them.\nFELIX REFECTORY IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED The extension until 6.30 of the\nmeal service in the Upper Refectory has\nnot diminished the queues downstairs.\nAs fast as the facilities are improved\nmore and more people take advantage\nof them. 250 to 300 suppers were\nserved daily at the beginning of last\nterm \u2014 this number h* \u00ab now doubled.\nComplaints have been received about\nthe slowness of the service upstairs:\nthis is due to the inadequacy of the\nser vio e lift, which Mr. Mooney suggests should be modified to carry one\npassenger with a trolley, and to the\nappalling telephone communication between the floors. The telephone has\nbroken down ten times this year; the\ncontractors - Siemens - blame it on\nheat, believe it or not. The Chairman of the Refectory Committee, Prof.\nNewitt, observed that ships' telephones withstood temperatures of 130\nto 140\u00b0 F. This matter is going to\nbe rectified.\nSome reorganisation has been suggested for the kitchens, which were\ndesigned to serve 800 lunches and are\nnow turning out 1000. It involves\nputting a door in the wall immediately\nbehind the cash desk, roofing in the\nsmall area, tiling the walls and forming a proper floor, and making an\nopening from this area into the vegetable preparation room. The Staines\nDish washing machine at present in\nuse is nearing the end of its useful\nlife, and it would be replaced by a 'Hercules' appliance. (At the moment\nthe washing-up after lunch is not\nfinished until 5 o 'clock.) The cost\nof this reorganisation is estimated\nat about \u00a31,900, nearly half of which\nwould be for the 'Hercules'.\nIMPERIAL COLLIGI DRAMATIC SOCIBTT\npresents\nMISERY ME A Oesjsdy of woe (t) by\nDENIS CANNAN TUESDAY sad WE DIBSD AY\nMARCH H*. \u00ab-|2fW TICKETS \u2022 s/6it/e.1/ CONCERT HALL AT 10 th. MATCH\nAt the meeting of the Refectory\nCommittee held on February 14th., much\ndiscussion was devoted to the facilities\nto be afforded to conferences etc that\nare held in the College, and to suggested improvements in the movement of\ndirty crockery from the refectory and\nthe washing up facilities.\n100 competitors in the Empire\nGames are to be accommodated in the\nhostel from August 2nd to the 5th. or\n8th. As usual the Union will be closed\nduring August, but it was felt that\nsome dining facilities should be\navailable to the visitors. If the\nrefectory is kept open for the first\nweek in August, it will lose \u00a3250,\nan alternative being to serve breakfast\nonly at five or six shillings a head,\nin which case no 1 oss would be suf-fe red. The refectory would be looked\noff from the rest of the Union build-ing.\nThe student members of the Committee objected to the use of the\nConcent Hall for conferences. The\nUnion was being used as a convenient\nsocial unit for the benefit of out-side rs, whereas it was intended for\nstudents only. They should be encouraged to use the refectory and common room in the Ayrton Hall, and a minute to this effect was recorded.\nThe small dining-room on the third\nfloor of the Union is being furnished\nat a cost of \u00a3167. It will be suitable\nfor small dinner parties of up to 16\npeople, and for the staff to use for\n\"business lunches.* Some ar gun ent arose on the question of booking, the\nDomestic Bursar asserting that \"\nmembers of staff do not want to come to\nthe Union to book the room.\" Mr.\nChadwiok pointed out that members of\nstaff ought to be members of the\nUnion also; he did not see why they\nshould not book at the Union office.\nIt is to be hoped that some face-sav-ing agreement will be reached.\nGUILDS NIGHT RALLY Thirty-one drivers entered last\nFriday for Guilds Motor Club's annual\nnight rally, the first since November\n1955. The first oar was away at 9.15\np.m., and headed north into Hertfordshire. The rally was in three sections,\nthe first involving a run out to Enfield , followed by a somewhat searching test of map-reading ingenuity which\ndaunted at least one very prominent mem ber! The section ended with an easy\ncross-country run to a desolate gravel\npit at Codicote.\nThe second section was a kind of\ntreasure hunt: fifteen questions were\nto be answered at fifteen well-scatter-ed places, to exercise out powers of\ncrossword-clue reading. Only one unfortunate resident was moved by the\nsound of anxious conference outside\nto protest at \"that ...... noise -it's NEARLY ONE O 'CLOCK!\" At this\nplace, too, one or two people were\nseen knee\u2014deep in the river after\ntaking a map-reference too literally.\nBack at the gravel pits once more,\nan half-hour's rest prepared the crews\nfor the third section, which was the\nclassic problem of tracing the wanderings of a mythical foreign agent. The\nthree hours allowed for this section\nwere far more than adequate for most\nof the crews, and we ambled at leisure\nto the roadhouse near Bishop's Startford which was the finish. Inquiry\namong the marshals failed to reveal\nwhich of them was the mysterious agent.\nPossibly, unlike ourselves, he had\nlost his way after all. It must be borne in mind that\nthe refectories on the island site\nare scheduled to be brought into use\nin 1960, which means holding out far\nonly a few years more. However, the\nauthorities must be made to realise\nthe urgency. Meanwhile the moving of\nthe ser vio e table out of the draught\nmight reduce the incidence of so much\ncold food.\nRAILWAY IS TS IN PORT On Wednesday, 19th. Feb., eleven members of the Railway Society visited the\nPort of London Authority Railways at\nTilbury. The railways at Tilbury are\nnow operated entirely by six diesel\nlocomotives of the Yorkshire Hngin\u00ab, Company's \"Janus* type, and we were Just\nin time to see the departure of four of\nthem after the lunch break. We then\ninspected one of the diesels which was\nin the inspection bay.\nThese locomotives have two 200 t up. Rolla-Royoe oil engines aa the poser\nunits with B.T.H. electrical transmissions. They have a central cab with\nthe power units under bonnets at ea oh end of the locomotive, giving them a two-faced appearance. We were offered\na short ride and with the party in the\no ab and on the running boards, this\nengine was driven some distance along\nthe dock lines and back to the inspection bay.\nThoughts now turned to steam, for\nthere were still three such loo o a ot ive a in the running shed. One of these, a Hudswell-Clarke of 1917 vintage waa\nnewly overhauled and resplendent In her\nsmart dark blue livery. It see a ada pity not to be able to photograph her\nso the guide waa approached with a view\nto having her pulled outside. SO sooner\nhad the word been said than the diesel\nwas started up again to pull oar quarry\nout into the open, and a large na ali iii of photographs were taken. All tares\nloo o not ives are to be transferred te the\nRoyal Docks in the near future.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX5 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR EDUCATION\nDear Sir,\nIn recent issues of FELIX much\nhas been written on the supposed lack\nof education of I.C. students. M:. Bridgwater accuses I.C. of being \"rather a biased college from the point of view\nof education.\" Surely this Is true of\nany oo lle ge. If one consider an all-arts college\nit is obvious that there is much more\nspecial is ation among the students than\nin an all-science establishment. Few\narts colleges have a course of General\nStudies lectures in science as I.C. does in non-scientific subjects. The\ntypical arts student deals with non-scientific matter both in study and\nleisure. The science student is not\nrestricted to science but takes a healthy interest in the arts.\nMr. Bridgwater asserts that \"Edu-cation has been said to consist mainly\nof contact between students.\" This\nmay be true to a certain extent, but\nstudents at a residential college do\nnot lead a normal life; they have lit tle contact with the everyday life of\naverage people - those with whom they\nwill work when they have left college.\nIn this respect a person living in\ndigs has a great advantage over his\nresidential colleagues as he has more\nopportunity of seeing how the other\nhalf lives.\nFrom the conclusions of Psi (ex\nLeeds) one gets the impression that\nhis visits to I.C. have been too few\nfor him to have appreciated fully the\nnature of life at this college. His\nsuggestions to rectify the matter of\n\"specialist university educations\"\nshow lack of understanding of the sit-u ation. Few people will agree that advanced\ntechnical colleges should be abolished\n- they are essential if the country is\nto keep pace with other nations in the\nfield of scientific development. Regarding his point that students are\nobliged to be oom e9 to 5 types by interfering grant authorities, I have\nyet to come across an instance. Finally, the I,C. staff does consist of\nlecturers and not teachers.\nIt appears to me that the popular\ntheory of scientists being strange\nlittle men tucked away in laboratories\nand having no interests other than\ntheir science is a complete fallacy.\nWhether so ie ntl sts themselves or the\ngeneral public have been responsible\nfor formulating this delusion would be\nhard to say.\nYours faithfully.\nJ. w. Murray.\nERRATUM\nDear Sir,\nI should like to correct a statement made in your Account of the concert given by the Imperial College\nOrchestra on Jan. 30th, Mr. Frank\nKennard, who conducted the orchestra\non that occasion and who will conduct\nthe forthcoming production of \"The\nMikado,\" is in fact Music Master at\nAlleyn's School and not at Dulwioh\nCollege as was stated in your report.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. Rodney Miles.\nELECT A RECTOR\nDear Sir,\nI read in today's paper that\nJame3 Robertson Justice has been installed with much acclamation, overripe tomatoes and toilet paper as\nRector of Edinburgh University. Not\nso long ago, Jimmy Edwards was carried shoulder high to a similar office\nat Aberdeen university.\nIs the time not opportune to elect\na Rector of Imperial College and to\nelect such a person by a democratic\nvote of the student body? As a suggestion, might I propose a man who resides close by oo lle ge and who would\nbring Imperial College to the notice\nof all: Spike Milligan.\nYours hopefully,\nJohn Druforth.\nTHE MASCOT QUESTION\nDear Sir,\nThe students of Southampton\nUniversity showed considerable enterprise in public ising their Centenary\nCharity Rag, and it Is unfortunate\nthat their efforts at I.C. necessitated police intervention. The anxiety\nand confusion that fc l lov/ ed Bo's removal suggests that we could usefully\nreview the position of our college\nmascots.\nIn answer to the critics who find\nthe whole array of carrots and pries ly bears rather childish, it should be\npointed out that college mascots serve\nas symbols of unit;.' no less ridiculous\nthan the hammer and sickle or the\nthistle of Scotland.\nWhilst it ma;\" be appreciated within\nLondon that our vintage vehicles are\ninviolate, we cannot expect the provincial universities to be aware of\nthis agreement. Cur vehicle? have been\ninspected by Royalty, they appear every\nyear on Morphy Day, and Bo was recently\nused in a certain de bagging ceremony.\nSouthampton might reasonably enquire\nfor our definition cf -ascots.\nThe ultimate responsibility for\nBo's abduction rests wit!: :.C. Union fc r failing to provide an ar-real ing and removable alternative. :as eot s like Phineas and Reggie are legendary, but ever.\nImperial is forgetting its own dear\nlittle Herbert.\nIt has been stated that we cannot\ninstall Herbert in the new Vnion until\nx he contractors have completed their\nperiod of responsibility, but it is\nhard to believe that no other jos it i or. can be found. .Youlc it not be possible\nto hang Herbert in the Union archway,\nfor example?\nThere remains another alternative.\nNow that Herbert has almost vanished\ninto obscurity we coul c without disrespect pension him off. He could be\nsucceeded by a larger and more enterprising three\u2014dimensional mascot at\na vigorous Installation ceremony.\nWe might in this way prevent a recurrence of Bo's unfortunate adventure.\nI remain. Sir,\nyour Obedient Servant,\nFJi.JJtmerson.\nSARAH JENKINS in the NEWS CHRONICLE last Saturday referred to the Southampton\nstudents who \"..snatched a valuable vintage car from e museum.\" Waterhouse would\ndoubtless have preferred\nthis to other comparisons\nthat have been made.\nSTUDENTS of current events will\nhave noted that the locations\nof the 'Thor' guided weapon\nsites are not being disclosed.\nThe reason oust be to avoid\nprejudicing U.G.C, decisions\nand Colcutt's whatnot _is to be\nused as an I.C. Ballistic Bssile.\nWE WERE HAPPY to mWe the Rector leave his guests to the\ncare of others jtf wer a recent\nHall Dinner and wander round\nthe Senior Common Roo- talking to both students and staff.\nIf only this were normal behaviour on the part of our\nprofessors as well.\nWILL COSSC pleas\" remove his\nliterature on the student fr on the Junior Oormon Room before\nother students go off at tan-gents.\nKAY I REALLY?\nX r~ WHY fc lM j^ FOR\nDO IT a sea ELECTRIC SHAVERS\n12\u00a3 \u2022\n\u00bb DISCOUNT\nAIL KATES SUTFLLED WHOLESALE\nAND SLJLRANTSEE\n?N?

    "content": "4 FELIX EDITOR :\nPETER LEVIN\nFrux\nCIRCULATION\nISOO\nPROBLEM OF THE ONE TRACK MIND The problem of broadening the minds of I.C. students occurs again and again la FELIX and Phoenix. It is suggested that we amalgamate with the E.C.A., that compulsory courses In English and history be introduced; even now large sums of money\nare spent on placing \"arts-type\" culture where we will fall over it. Professor\nBarton may express the desire that his post-graduate students should work a seventy-hour week; most people will agree that it is undesirable for students to devote themselves exclusively to their particular field and a problem thus exists because many\ndo. The universal remedy is to get at the student, to force the \"arts-type\" culture\nupon him. Is this reasonable? The aim of this article is to show that it is not,\nthat the remedy lies elsewhere.\nThose who have a hand in educating us may be divided into three groups - the\nteaching staff, the governing and administrative body, and the General Studies Committee. Of these, the teaching staff have by far the greatest influence on students,\nmost of whom arrive directly from school and thus are at a relatively impressionable\nage. What of these men who exert so much influence?\nDON'T BLAME THE MORONS\nScience in the university should be taught against the back-ground of the interrelation of science and society, with an awareness of the reason for scientific research and how it fits into modern life. In this College it is not. What is the\nreason? Either our staff have no interests apart from their work, or else they are\nprevented from expressing them. Into the first category fall the men that Professor\nBarton wants. The reason that such men are at I.C. is that they are selected solely\non their ability to conduct research. (Certainly they are not selected on their\nability to stimulate the interest of their students, which should be the prime aim\nof every teacher. Manifestly many of them are incapable of communicating facts, let\nalone ideas.) Outside the narrow field in which they work, the development of their\nminds has been completely arrested. The Oxford Dictionary defines such men as morons.\nObviously it is unfair to blame them for what they are. The system is at fau lb. OUR STREET CORNER PROF\nWithout doubt there are men in this College who come into the second category,\ni.e. who are prevented from making public their interest in outside affairs. For\nconsider: \"It is a mark of the Government's confidence that I.C. has been selected\nto lead this massive advance in higher technological education.\" Now suppose that\none of our professors stood up at a public meeting and denounced the Government's polio y of manufacturing the H bomb. Does anyone seriously suggest that the governors of the College would applaud such a display of independence? They may not\nliterally have traded academic freedom of expression for marks of the Government's confidence, but the staff are by no mean* as voluble as once they were. Two years\nago Professor Blackett drew an audience of four hundred when he lectured on the\nmilitary significance of atomic weapons. In this field there have been many developments sino e, but no mare lectures from Professor Blackett. Gone indeed are the\ndays when Professor Rankine spoke at street corners, when Sir Thomas Holland (then\nReotor) debated with Professor Levy whether \"the Empire is a force for good.\"\n(Incidentally, is it coincidence that the Maths, department, of which Prof. Levy was\nuntil recently head, should be the only one with a course on the history and philosophy of its sci eno e?) Again the system is at fault.\nSHOULD THE GOVERNORS GO?\nWhat can be done to change the system, for changed it must be unless the sole\noutput of Imperial College is to consist of highly-trained morons? Any changes must\ncome from the top. It is questionable whether the governors recognise the faults\nof the system, in which case they are incompetent and should either resign or be\nforced to. If they recognise the faults and are unwilling to act, the same\napp lie a. We mast have a governing body willing and able to guarantee those of\nour teachers who have keen and interesting minds the freedom to use them and to\nexpress themselves; a governing body that will at the same time constitute a professor-hiring CUB professor-firing squad, to hire more sen with character as\nwell aa strings of papers to their credit, and fire those without. Only then will\nthe College fulfil the purpose for which it is intended.\nGENERAL STUDIES TOO\nUnder these conditions the problem of broadening the sci eno e student's mind\nwill disappear. In contact with men of keen and inspired thought, students will\nautomatically be stimulated into finding out for themselves the fa aoi nation that\nliterature and history, for example, already hold for others. There will be no\nneed for four-year degree courses with compulsory lectures In these subjects.\nPossibly even the General Studies Committee may be stimulated into providing store\nthan six lectures a term on the con texture of science and humanity. At present\nit is the chief exponent of the \"feed them culture\" principle, nearly a as that of Professor Barton and equally deplorable.\nP.H. Levin.\nFootnote:\nThe six lectures referred to above comprise the three already given thi\u00bb .\nby Professor Andrade on William Gilbert, Robert Hooks, and Isaac Newton, and the\nthree to be given shortly by Dr. G.J. Whitrow on \"The Riae of Scientific Method,\"\nTHE BO AFFAIR\n... continued from page 1,\nHowever, there were those who did\ntravel to see the Rag, and they are reported to have had a pleasant evening\nwith most of the female population of\nthat University. Indeed, some did not\nreturn until the following day! U.C. and Kings did not apparently heed the\n7-C's words and much wanton damage is reported to have been caused.\nBut, what had been happening behind the scenes all this time? As\nsoon as the loss was discovered, Dave\ntelephoned all of the London colleges,\nin vain. Mr. Henry, the College's pet\nbloodhound was called in, but he was\nnot much interested, so Dave called\nin the C.I.D. It was rather disappointing to find that the 'tec s were\nvery ordinary looking chaps (almost\nlike students in disguise).

Students at this College have long been accustomed to the or y\" We must hare\nmore culture at I.C.\" Latterly another voice has appeared on the scene. It is\nthat of Professor Barton of the Organic Chemistry department, and he seemingly\nwill have no part of culture. This gentleman has demanded that his post-graduate\nstudents should work Beventy f70^ hours a week. It does not take a post-graduate\nstudent from the Maths, department to calculate that, if one does not sleep, a whole fourteen hours a day are left in which to eat, drink and he merry. This\nis of course far too much; students\nBOANERGES IN THE PUBLIC EYE The removal of Bo by four\nSouthampton students provoked considerable attention in the National Press,\nas well as causing I.C. one of its biggest headaches for many a long time.\nThe story of his disappearance is now\nwidely known, and it was rather astonishing to find that the newspapers were in\ngeneral agreement as to the method of\nremoval.\nThe first indication in the press\nof his loss was in the THE EVENING NEWS\nand STANDARD of Friday Feb. LVth, both\nblatantly stating that Bo was of French\norigin. (One feels that this is the\nChad touch.) The NEWS called him a\"1902 De Dion Bouton\", while THE STANDARD' s description was rather vague:\n\"a1902 French Boanerges.\"\nHowever, the next morning all agreed that he was a James and Browne\nmodel, and the majority had more or\nless got the story. THE MANCHESTER\nGUARDIAN put the Rag before that on\nthe Dounreay Reactor; THE TELEGRAPH\nhad a good report, and THE TIMES described us as \"rumbling with Batterings of\nindignation.\" THE EXPRESS and THE MAIL\nalso gave prominence to the story, the\nlatter quoting Estyn Davies as saying\nthat Bo was an \"old girl\", and the\nraiders were variously described as\n\"b lighters\" by Estyn and as \"rogues\"\nby Chad\nBy this time the B.B.C. had caught\nthe story, and the 1 o 'clock news announced that Bo was on his way home,\nwith \u00a315 expenses paid by Southampton.\nIn the evening both channels of T.V. Included a short film of Bo's return\nin the News. The evening papers published photographs of his trix at phant home-coming, THE NEWS announcing:\n\"Boneshaker ia back..... It's good to\nsee you too\". There was some mention\nof him in the Sunday papers, and then\nhe faded from the pub lio eyes, but\nnot those of I.C.R.C. S. and R.S. M. promised to\nin with C.4G. on the issue, and\non the Monday plans to descend on\nSouthampton were **\u2022\u00bb\"\u2022\u2022', and coaches\nwere booked and filled. A meeting was\nheld in the Snack Bar where Dave Stevens\nattempted to calm those, and there were\nquite a few, who wanted blood. Bo was\nat this stage going to Southampton on\nthe following day to participate in the\nRag procession, in order to attract\nmore money for charity. However the\nfinal blow to any hopes of retaliation\no a me with a phone call from the VioeChancellcr of Southampton, who stated\nthat Bo and his entourage would not be\nwelcome. He was afraid that if too\nmany alien students descended on the\ntown, the procession would be wrecked,\nand little money be collected. He had\nmade a similar plea to Kings and U.C. who had also suffered at the hands of\nthe Rag-raiders.\nContinued on page 4 ...\nwould become bloated and decrepit,\nand the standard of work would suf-fer. Why on earth does Professor\nBarton make such moderate demands?\nThis matter has been brought up in\nFELIX before now. It deserves to be\nre-emphasised, in view of the rather\ndifferent opinions expressed by another\nmember of staff in the approaching Phoenix, and lest these questions be lost\nsight of in a welter of rags and pan*\ncake races.\nSEEPAGE4 How does it happen that in an university college a professor ean vole e such demands? On page 4 some criticisms are made of the system that permits it, and a remedy is suggested.\n\n"

What will the new bird be\nlike?\nThe latest innovation is a sixteen\npage supplement on a particular theme\nsuitably chosen for each issue. The\nSpring Issue has, appropriately, an Anthology on Women. This is both a aerie m* and satirical account of woman. It includes a humorous statistical analysis\n\"Does she love you?\", and a cynical and\nalmost Lewrentian criticism of the I.C. under-graduate's attitude to women,\nwhich should arouse mixed feelings. Inseparable from women is fashion and two\npages have been devoted to a discourse\non this, complete with photographs. For\nthose readers who, sheltered in I.C. have had little chance to meet the\nfairer sex, an amusing synopsis of\nseveral types is given, accompanied\nby illustrations. The middle two\npages of the supplement merit some attention and laughter. In \"Women in\nPolitics\" some debatable points are\nraised concerning the suitability of\nwomen for this hazardous occupation.\nThe literary aspect of the magazine\nis catered for by an excellent short\nstory \"The Lake\" specially written to\ncater for the less subtle grasp of\npsychology of the average technologist.\nThe central figure is a monkey, but perhaps not the monkey you may first think\nhim to be. \"Paddy on the Buildings\" is a lucid essay, with great humanity, portraying an Irish nav vy. It will be interesting to note comments on another\nMINES' NEW MASCOT Mines are now the proud owners ef a new portable mas-eot (act that Clementine is completely immobile, of o our se). Just over a fortnight ago Alan Lewis, as chairman of the\nsub-oom mitte e taxed with the job of obtaining su oha mas-cot, obtained, by soma means or other, a Mlchelin man of\nthe type often seen riding en the tops of the company's vans. After being painted in suitable colours it was introduced to the Minesmen at their Union Meeting.\nThis meeting was unique in the history of the Mines\nUnion in that the President of Bedford College, Miss Marilyn Farr, the Vice-President, and sundry other members\nof this illustrious college were present. After making\na short speech, addressing the meeting by \"Mr. President,\nGentlemen and Lover Boy in the corner...'\nMiss Farr christened Mitch, as the mascot is to be called, by pouring a pint\nof bitter over his head. (The\"Lover\nBoy\" is naturally the fortunate gentleman who had the honour of being elected\nthe \"Bedford Beau\" last term).\nwell written article \"Angel Station\",\nw hio his a personal reaction to religious\nphilosophy.\nThe College? It is mentioned. A member of staff aims criticism at our\nteaching methods and our undergraduates.\nA series starts on \"Imperial University\nS.W.7.\", analysing and discussing the\ncase for and the arguments against a new\nuniversity in South Kensington, by undergraduates particularly well qualified to\ncomment.\nThe activities of I.C. men? They\nare here. An entertaining personal\naccount of the Social activities has\nbeen synthesised from dull reports.\nThe Sporting events are summarised and\nthere is a page on I.C. Sports Day.\nThere appears also an account of an\nI.C. expedition to the Pyrenees.\nA correspondence column has been\nopened and a sharp exchange of blows\nhas already occurred.\nThis issue's final article is called\n\u2022Down with Culture\", but don't take this\ntoo literally. Those who write for\nPhoenix believe in our cultural heritage.\nPerhaps the pendulum has swung back in\nthis issue but e qui lib rum will be reach-ed. The Editorial Board look forward to\nyour condemnations, crit io is a and we hope\nyour praise. This is a critical phase\nin the history of our college. Student\nopinion must be expressed and heard.\nPhoenix and FELIX are the media. It is hoped you will not only buy Phoenix but\nREAD it. A.M. H....oon t la aed from page E. ney proceeded without event. Meeting\nonly feeble resistance, an entry into\nGuilds was secured, and a vociferous\nKangella echoed through the corridors.\nMr. Sheldon being delivered, R.C.S. staged a strategic withdrawal, and were\namused by the sight of sundry Guild\u2014asm\nbeing wetted by their compatriot*, la the meantime two pairs of Guilds bags\nwere acquired without any resistance.\nBored by their easy task, the scientists moved away to Queenie's whence a charge was led through Guilds and Mines.\nThe noise made on this journey had some\neffect on the inebriate Guildsmen, who\nmustered up as lse able army. On their\nreturn, R.C.S. immediately gave battle\nand, despite being outnumbered by 2 to\n1, lost only five bags and their Assistant Secretary.\nThey them retired te the\nef their main building, pursued at a \u2022are al stan os by angry Ouildamem, thoa*\nwho were not acquiring fire-extinguishers,\nthat is. The resulting battle, in wh i oha fire hose was rather unfairly used, caused\nconsiderable havoc, and the dampening of\na little boy blue.\nSeveral rather soggy\nengineers were seen\nin the gutters\nef Imperial Institute Read, having\nbeen en the sharp\nead of the a fore meat ioa ed hose. At\n'this point an ar-al st ioe was called\nsad the damage\nsurveyed. B.C.3. Union officers\nwould like te\nta a ak these stalwarts who cave up\naa after a eo a's work te clear ap\nthe mess, las lees telly, ao-ens\never did seel are the wee time\nslowed.\nThe next day being St. Valentine's Day, Mitch was presented with his first\nValentine, and with his first birthday\npresent. Some Miners are still mystified\nby the significance or otherwise of the\ncabbage, brush, and lemon, presented.\nTwo protectors having been elected,\nthe meeting broke up, and the jubilant\nMinesmen went to show their proud new\nmascot to the Guilds. The solid phalanx ef Miners swept straight through\nthe Guilds, and back to Mines, carrying\none or two Guildsmen, or their trousers\nwith them. Unfortunately there appeared\nto be more Guildsmen in the R.S. M. than\nin Guilds, and they resented the predicament of some of their fellows. Thence\nensued the battle. The fighting mob\nsurged back and forth on the Mines' steps\nuntil the spirits were dampened by a solid sheet of water from one of too labs,\nabove. The battle waned, and most of the\ncombatants retired either to quench their\nthirsts, or to lectures. However the\nmore resolute carried the battle to the\nfirst floor where fire-extinguishers and\nhoses were brought to bear. After a few\nminutes of pi to he d battle the soaked\nlines and Guildsmen retired, leaving\nsomeone else to clear up the mess.\nIt was rather unfortunate that Viscount Faimouth was to visit the R.S. M. the next day, and in order to get the\nplace cleaned up properly a firm of office cleaners had to be called in.\nMeanwhile the Bedford Beau, had been\nkidnapped. He was asked to get a taxi, and as he returned with it six\nyoung \"la die3* piled in on top of him,\nand he was carried, not unwillingly,\naway towards Regents Park. He returned\nin one piece several hours later.\nNow that the Mines have a rag mascot\ntoo, the ragging will not be so one-sided\nas before, but it is to be hoped that the\nrags will be more amusing than destructive.\n\n"

The referee had some difficulty\nin deciding the winner after three very tough and exo it ing rounds, but eventually\nawarded the Light-weight title to Jaylor. GORDON HALSEY, the I.C.

The College Captains\nhad the usual difficulty in raising\nteams! Mllce Clarke roped in 24 Guildsmen, while Gordon Halsey persuaded 27\nMiners to box. The Miners, without\ntheir usual superiority of numbers,\nwere made to fight all the way, and\neventually, after one of the most ex-oi ting and close competitions ever,\nGuilds ran out winners by 99 points to\n88 (and R.C.S.2). One of the best bouts was the final\nof the welter-weight contest; Williams\n(C&G) showed much boxing ability, but\nH. Smith (R.S. M.) with his greater\nstrength rallied in the last round to\nwin a very close fight, despite the\nblood streaming from his nose. Williams,\nhowever, was awarded the tankard for\nthe best boxer. Perhaps the toughest\nand most exciting fight was the heavyweight final; J. Piatt (RSM) had the\nbetter of the earlier exchanges, but\nM.

This match\nwas combined with a fixture between\nHeme Rill and Ranelagh, and the first\nmen hose in this latter event palled\nout the best in the I.C. team, with\nthe result that Collins produced his\nfastest time of ET m.42s.

STORM INTO FINAL\nWith a fine display of open and\nattacking football, I.C. defeated\nC.E.M. by 20 points to 3 to reach the\nfinal of the U.L. Rugby Football Cup.\nThey will now meet Kings' on 8 th.\nMarch at Motspur Park.\nThe game with C.E.M. opened with I.C. playing up the slope and against the\nwind, but in spite of this they scored\nquickly when Gilbert, backing up a dribble by Phillips and Bruce, went\nover after 10 minutes. The try was not\nconverted, but the score was increased\nsoon afterwards when Hearn converted a penalty. The C.F.M. team then settled\ndown and held I.C. at bay for some time,\nuntil a shrewd cross-kick by Hearn to\nthe right wing allowed Mllward to show\nhow dangerous he can be, when he gathered cleanly and beat his opposite number\nby sheer speed and went over in the\ncorner. This made the score 9 - 0 at\nhalftime.\nSoon after the start of the second\nhalf, Bruce, playing a vigorous game\nat wing-forward, following quickly on\na defensive mistake, dribbled over the\nC. E.U. line to so ore. Hearn then made\na good run from the C.E.M.25 line to\nshake off three tacklers and score\nunder the posts. This he o on ver tod, bringing the so ore to 17 - 0. The\nfinal I.C. so ore cams from a good\nthree quarter movement resulting in\nGibson going over In the corner after\na30 yd. run. The C.E.M. score came\nfrom a defensive lapse on the part of\nI.C., due perhaps to playing too\neasily, allowing the C.E.M. Yfinger to\nburst through to score an un converted try.\nENJOYING A GOOD SEASON\nThe Rugby Club has, for the first\ntime, consistently fielded seven sides\non a Saturday, and as its scope and\nnumbers have increased so has its\nsuccess. The l st. XV has reached the\nfinal of the U.L. Cup, and shows a respectable record for the season.\nThe 2nd. XV gives a measure of the reserve Btrength of the Club; of fourteen\ngames played, only one has boon lost,\nand only 57 points have been conceded,\nwhilst 190 have been scored. The 'A' shows a good points average and in\nspite of losing numerous players, notably their fire to apt a in, Riley, with\na broken leg, they have managed to win\nmore than half their games. The 'Extra\nA', under the vociferous leadership of\nDai Thomas, has an excellent mat on record and has scored 292 points with\n57 against, probably due to the powerful running and conversions of their\nfly-half Kitohenor.\nThe 'B' and 'CZ' teams, whilst having\na loss than 50 per cent, record, have\nhad a fairly successful oo as on and show\ngood points averages.
