    "content": "2 FELIX ST. YAN1956 Dine members of I.C Gliding Club took part in\ntha World Gliding Championships held this year at St.\nXan a oro dp ome in Central Franoe. Frank and Hike were\ncrowing far Philip Wills; Martin, Philip S. and Toby\nlooked after Diok Georgeson, New Zealand's 'pilot; Tony\nand Ron helped everyone, and Betsy and Doo. 3. compared\nnotes with other international meteorologists and collected valuable information from the world's best glider\npilots.\nFinding it impossible to give a reasonable account\nof the Championships in a limited space, one o an only\nrecord a few impressions and hope that they will gon-vey a fair idea of the event.\nThe prelude to our departure was a month's work\nfitting out the gliders an? trailers, buying every-thing, from tow-ropes to toothbrushes, fixing two-way\nradios in the gliders and the Vangaurds, arranging\npassports - and so on. Ohoe at St. Xan the activity\nincreased even more, for in all such events there are\nalways many things to be done at the last minute which\nsimply cannot be predicted when at home.\nTwenty-five teams, speaking fifteen languages of\ntheir own, and trying to speak the other fourteen as\nwell made life very interesting and at times very o on fusing. However, in gliding, as in other forms of International Sport, much o an be accomplished by gestures\nand a little guesswork and everyone got along quite\nwell.\nTwo of the features characteristic of St. Tan as\nfar as we could tell were the daily aerobatics by their\ncrack team of four 'Stampe' biplanes, who would fly in\nformation, inverted, at about 20 feet above the ground,\nfor half the length of the airfield; and the p.a. system wh i oh appeared to be always doing one of three\nthings:(1) Relaying, at great power, Eddie Calvert's rendering of \"Oh Mine Papa\", (2) Announcing that * M.X..... est demands' an Secretariat General av ood' urge no e.\",(3) Warning us, in slightly hysterical tones,\nthat \"Oh or age app roo he avec vents a so ix ante dix\nkilometres al'heure - guard ea vos plane urs I\" The sight of sixty gliders being sucked up into\nthe maw of a giant thundercloud, which had been darkening the sky for the previous half-hour, and the sound\nof the radio messages to the ground as they reported\n\"10,000 feet - oxygen an, 18,000 feet - aileron3 frozen;\n21,000 feet, on course, still climbing - ;\" was only\nto be e quailed by the suspense round the central control at 9.30 p.m. the following evening, after a day's task across the S.W. Alps to Cuers, dose to the Med.\nAll the machines save one - that of Paul M 'Cready, who\nwas eventually to win the Championships for the U.S.A., had telephoned back by just after eight. Had Paul\np ranged? Was he still up; or stuck in some narrow\nvalley miles from anywhere ? He must be down by now...\nEveryone present was relieved when we heard that he had\nlanded 15 km. beyond Cuers at 9.15 p.m. by the landing\nlight3 of a military airstrip - thus winning the task.\nPhilip Will's description of his 380 km. flight\nto Cuers was almost as full of rapture as was his crew's account of the following day - spent lounging amongst\nthe lovelies on the beach at Toulon !\nFinally and inevitably, one remembers the food,\nwine and hospitality of the French. Few things are mare\nwelcome than the sight of a large, hot, excellent and\nwillingly-e erve d meal, in a small restaurant, at 10 p. bu, after a day's hard driving in the heat of Summer.\nAbove all, there was the feeling, all too rare\nthese days, that here were teams from all over the\nWorld, both East and West, some of them State sponsored,\nwho oo ul d come together and compete on a completely\nfriendly basis (although determined to finish as near\nthe top as possible), without bringing to the meeting\nany of the unpleasantness and argument wh i oh seems to\nao or mp any present day international meetings, whether\npolit io al or otherwise.\nAs the French advertisements say: \"VOL A TOILE,\nSPORT HEAL.\" T.H.

C., Plymouth, was in doubt until the\nlast ball which Dytham, to the Surprise of all con-cern ed, smote for the winning run to give I.C. victory\nby one wicket. The dusky pair, Bhatti and Carter,\nshared 8 wickets whilst Walker(36), Shepherd (22),\nand Hearn(59) obtained the major snare of the runs.\nThe latter, alternating between glorious hits and\npalpable misses, scored 48 of his runs in boundaries.\nThe next day saw the team on the stately ground of\nthe R.N. Barracks at Devonport. I.C. managed to scrape\nonly 95 runs, of wh i oh Kitchener soo red a painstaking\n29, quite out of ohara o ter with his usual tour form.\nThe Barrooks obtained the required runs for the loss\nof 3 wickets. Inoidentally this defeat was I.C, first sino e the 1953 tour.\nPrinoetown, with its grey stone prison and o ott ages surrounded by the bleak hills of Dartmoor, the whole\nalmost enveloped in low o loud, was the setting for a new fixture, that against the Dartmoor Prison Offioers.\nThe wicket was prepared by the prisoners on parole and\none suspected that they had left holes where a ball\nmight fly and injure an uns usp eot ing warder. The\nwarders soo red102, wh i oh they thought was a mammoth total. For once the English bowlers managed to share\nthe spoils with the two spin 'wizards', Bhatti and\nCarter.

Once again\nKitchener (67) was mainly responsible, helped by Faaroa\n(38) and Shepherd (37). The crumbling wicket was of no\nhelp to pace bowlers and once again Carter and Bhatti\ntook the .\n.\n. .ck ots between then.

    "content": "4 FELIX Feu x CIRCULATION1200 EDITOR: John Bramlsy\n* PRODUCTION MANAGER: Peter Levin\nThe beginning of a new session is perhaps an appropriate time for a few weighty editorial remarks an\nRags. We might begin: a university Education leads up\nto a position of responsibility, and responsibility\nimplies a certain code of decorum of its bearer - but\nthis is not meant to be a lecture.\nIt has often been said that the standard of ragging has fallen in recent years; many reasons far this\nhaving been propounded. We do not propose to enter into\nthat argument, but set before' you what we consider to\nbe a good standard of ragging.\nThe primary consideration is that a rag should be\nfunny - not only to the participants, but to all on-look ers, and that it should be \"in good taste\". I.C. have a high reputation in this respect; but rags do\ntend to get out of hand, and it is then that the fol lowing point is frequently overlooked. There should be\nno damage to property wh i oh may oo at the 'victims' of\nthe episode money that they cannot afford. In fact,\nsuch 'victims' as there are ought to be able to be\namused when viewing the incident in retrospect. We are\nfully in favour of a good rag. We hope to bo able to\nparticipate in, and record in FELIX, many in the oo ming session - but we do not want to see the college get a bad name as a result of the actions of a thoughtless\nfew.\nTHIS EDITION IS UNIQUE ! - 8 pages, bigger print, and\nit is still only three pence. As always, FELIX is independent of financial support from the Union. Tour\nUnion Counoil cannot dictate to you through the paper.\nThis is unlike SENNET, wh i oh oost sU.L.U. a lot of\nmoney every year.\nAs this is our Freshers' Issue, produced by a much\ndepleted staff, we do not apologise for using a small\nproportion of material that has appeared before In\nprevious editions. Our older readers may miss some of\ntheir favourite features. \"Viewpoint\", \"Letters to the\nEditor\", and some news items have been held over until\nthe next issue, No. 96, which will appear on Friday\nOctober 19th. As usual, FELIX will come out on\nevery alternate Friday this session. We are not alone\nin thinking that it is worth 0.2143 of a penny per day\nto be informed on I.C. affairs - so remember to buy a copy of this paper every time it appears.\nContributions to FELIX are always welcomed. - So\nare letters to the Editor. Do not be afraid to write\nin. The paper is 'made up' on the Sunday before the\nFriday on w hio hit is due to appear. If club secretaries desire publicity for their club, it is up to them\nto write us a report of their activities now and again*\nPut your reports and articles in the Union letter rao k not later than Saturday lu noh time of the 'make up*\nweekend. The sooner we have the articles the better.\nThe next issue of FELIX will contain reports in\nfull of the three expeditions carried out under the\na us pio es of the College Exploration Board, A report\nof the Camargue Expedition already lies on our desk.\nWe hope that the others will be forthcoming when the\nparticipants have recovered from their exertions.\nAlso in the next issue we hope to print \"P.G.' s A HLre\", an amusing account of a holiday in a hired\nlaunch on the Thames wh i oh gave much pleasure to two\nI.C. men this s msu TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENTS\nUntil the main part of the Union building becomes available later in October the following temporary quarters have been obtained :-Bridge and Chess Clubs: the room wh i oh was known as\nthe \"small lounge\" last year, opposite the Messengers'\nOffice on the ground floor of the Beit Building.\nCommittee Room: any clubs or committees who need to\nhold a meeting during the first fortnight of term may\nuse the President's Office. Bookings may be made in\nthe Union Offioe.\nTable Tenuis Club: the roam which was known last year\nas 'Committee Roam 'A\" an the third floor of the New\nHostel.\nDuring the first fortnight of term the Dsnoing.\nJudo, and Fencing Clubs will have to hold meetings in\nthe Snack Bar - and any outside rooms wh i oh are avail-able. In the period Oct. 23rd. Deo 1st., the Concert Hall will also be available for these clubs and\nthe new Gymnasium should be available as from Deo. 1st. The Badminton Club will continue to operate on outside\ncourts until the Gymnasium is ready.\nSTUDENT OFFICERS\nAnyone who wishes to make criticisms or suggestions about any aspect of the Union or College life\nshould approach the appropriate student representative,\neither personally or in writing.' This representative\nwill be failing in his duty if he does not investigate\nany serious suggestions fully. On the other hand, folk\nwho grumble without coming forward with their own ideas\nare failing in their duty too.\nA list of student officers and student representatives on college commit te osi win be posted in the\nUnion throughout the coming session.

UNION OPENING ???\nAs non-fresher s are already aware, the\nUnion is awaiting eagerly the opening of\nnew premises in Prince Consort Road. Last\nJune the Union was informed that the hulk\nof the building would he ready by October\n1 st, but it soon became apparent to those\nwatching the progress closely that there\nwould be some delay, caused (we are told)\nby labour shortages and technical difficulties. The latest news concerning the\nopening Of the new building is subject to\nsuch incredible and nerve-racking\nfluctuation that it is impossible to\npublish a definite schedule at this stage.\nAt a \"take-over meeting\" on 25th September, attended by the Rector, the\nPro-Rector, the Clerk to the Governors,\nthe Head of the Planning Department,\nthe Refectory Manager and the present\nand past Presidents of I.C.U. it was\ndecided that the Lower Refectory could\nbe opened on Monday, October 8 th and\nthe remainder of the building( except\nthe gymnasium and Upper Refectory) on\nOctober 2 3 rd. The President of I.C. was asked to impart this happy news to\nthe students j and the front page of\nFelix was originally devoted to this. Yet, such is the apparent\ndifficulty of adhering to a building schedule, that six days later tMs programme had to be radically altered.\nNot only did the contractors declare\nthat it had become impossible to open\nthe bulk of the building on October\n23rd but, far more serious, the\nscheduled opening of the Lower\nRefectory was endangered.\nFortunately a frantic journey\nacross west London enabled the front\npage of Felix to be re-captured from\nthe printers and suitably amended.\nAt the time of writing (.October\n4th) it is still not known whether the\nLower Refectory can be opened on the\nfirst day of term. Meanwhile the\nfollowing refectories will do their very best to cope with increased\nnumbers:-1.\n2.\nAyrton Hall( Unwin Building). Refectory under the Imperial\nInstitute building.3. I.C. Snack Bar (Beit Building).\nNotices will be posted in every\ndepartment and in the temporary (!)\nUnion giving the latest news about\nthe Lower Refectory and the rest of\nthe building. Meanwhile the Union\ncentre will have to remain in the\nUnwin building. Those who went away in June\nexpecting to find a shining new\nUnion on their return will be\ndisappointed at the delay,which\nwe can only hope will not be\nprolonged. A realistic guess at\nthe date of moving into the bulk\nof the Union building seems to be\nabout mid-November.\nThe completion of the Union building\nwill represent a big step forward towards\nbringing a proper University atmosphere\nto the lives of I.C. students. However,\nonly when living- near college can a student obtain the full benefit of a University career, and plans for an\neven more important advance - the\nprovision of more hostel accommodation\n- have now matured. The College has\nacquired three sides of Prince's Gardens (adjoining Exhibition Road).\nDemolition of the existing structures\nof the East and South sides should\nbegin shortly and it is hoped that\naccommodation for about 450 students\nwill be ready in three years' time.\nMeanwhile, a small but very welcome\nextension of the present hostel involving 25 extra rooms - should be\nfinished by Christmas.\nA.K.

    "content": "FELIX3 This art iole is reproduced from the Freshers' Edition\nof two years ago. It is perhaps lamentable that the\nlast paragraph is still applicable.\nCL \u00a3ett e%p cam the Glde&t Memlfet\nDear Fresher,\nOur Editor, in his wisdom, is of the opinion that\na short note from the oldest active member of the Felix\nBoard may he of interest to you. It is with some astonishment that I find this honour falling on me, and\nwith much trepidation that I reo or d my experiences and\nideas on a few questions wh i oh have been important in\nmy university life. There is nothing in these notes\nfor the glib young-man-about-town: I write only in the\nhope that some of you are as sly, confused and lost as\nX was when I entered our oo lle ge. Only four years have passed sino eI crept into\nthe Bookstall and bought a so arf( which represented\nStudenthood to my young brain ), and then stuffed it into my pocket be o a use I was too self o on so io us to wear\nit. I soon learned that I need not skulk in disguise,\nfor the Fresher is not a target for gibes and sneers;\nindeed the same day a thousand officials from a hundred o lub s urged me most pi too us ly to join them in\ntheir particular road to Elysium.\nIn those days a high percentage of the older\nstudents were ex-ser vio em an, and many were old enough\n(and experienced enough) to be my father. They were\nmuch more self-assured than the people who arrived\nstraight from the sixth-form, and they occupied all the\nimportant positions in the Union. We lived in awe of\nthem - for the first few days. The percentage of ex-be rv xo e men has fallen considerably sino e then, and it seems to me that with this decline we have become mors\nsteady, sober and industrious, much less interesting,\nand much less enterprising in Union affairs generally.\nThis view may, however, suffer from aberrations associated with my extreme age.\nIn our early Fresher days, most of my contemporaries studied conscientiously, and went home at five\no 'clock. I was among them. After a term or so I began\nto yearn for female company, but having been equipped\nwith an efficient mental chastity belt at school, I was very reserved, awkward in company and, worse, unable to dance. The latter defect at least oo ul d be\nrepaired, so I bought a book on Ballroom Dancing (the\nunion library has since been equipped with one) and\ngrimly learned a few steps on the floor of ray lodgings. Then, with palpitating heart, glistening brow, dry\ntongue and hands dripping with sweat, I wont to a hop.\nIt was a dreadful experience, but it was the beginning\nof my oo lle ge life.\nI was fortunate enough to share lodgings with\nseveral other students, and we wasted a great deal of\ntime together. We would often spent half the night\ndiscussing Politics, Religion, Art, Women, Prostitution\nand allied subjects, Morality, Books, and the World\nas it was beginning to unfold to us. We worked sufficiently to pass our exams, with a little to spare. (We\nfound it helpful to suppose that anybody who learns\neverything in his syllabus not only has no time to\nlearn anything else, but must surely go mad). We were\nnever in danger of madness or suicide, and. these\ndiscussions form some of the pleasantest memories of\nmy life.\nIn due course I came into contact with the Student Rag. We dashed down the streets and did things\ncollectively wh i oh none of us would have done alone.\nI saw acts of wanton destruction (smashing a Belisha\nbe ao on, for instance) wh i oh would have been called\nvandalism or hooliganism had they been perpetrated by\nthe \"lower classes\". But on other occasions, nor ph y Day, the Great Victoria Rag, and at several informal\nbattles between R.C.S. and Guild's,I witnessed scenes\nwhich I shall always remember with delight. It seems\na quality of rags that they appear best in retrospect.\n(The back numbers of FELIX, available in the Onion\nLibrary, contain accounts of many of these events.).\nYou may have already run your head into the eternal problem of the Cultural Relations of the Scientist.\nIt is widely understood that \"Culture\" means reo og nl s NQ, B.B., SOCIAL LIFE IN I.C. ISNT WHAT IT USED TO BE !\ning Picasso'e Blue Period, Beethoven's Quartet Op, 59\nNo. 2 (first movement, second subject) or Shelley's \"Prometheus Unbound\"\u2022 If you know nothing about these\nyou can learn something by going to the I.C. General\nStudies lectures, and by reading a few carefully\nchosen books: by becoming in fact, a Kultur-o ono io us bore. This is rather like sitting in front of an\ninfra-red lamp in Stepney, and then boasting of your\nRiviera holiday. Surely, a cultured person is one who\nis responsive to beauty, and who is repelled by u gli ness, and who makes his own life, and others, happier\nand richer by his reactions to all external a auditions. Knowledge of the list above may help in the achievement\nof such a state, but so may many other things, one of\nthe most important being the rational discipline and\naesthetic appeal of Science. In this respect we have\nan advantage over the Arts man, although many scientists neglect it, with the result that we have a collective reputation for moroni sh ness. Do not be\nintimidated by the conn on, erroneous, petty conception\nof \"Culture\".\nIt any seem to you that I.C. is a bit of a hole.\nOur Union is still in a shocking condition: we have\nnowhere to eat oom fort ably; we have nowhere to sit.\nThe authorities promise us eventual relief from these\ninconveniences, but we cannot expect it for years,\nand it will be inadequate when it arrives. Until we\nhave a high percentage of residential students our\ncollege will always be something less than a University. But it is the centre of our lives far several\nyears, and it provides us with the greatest of all boons; the companionship of kindred spirits. If you\nneglect your fellows at oo lle ge you will pay for it in loneliness and frustration. Do not go home regularly at five o 'clock. Stay for supper occasionally\nand talk with your new friends. Have a drink now and\nagain, but not alone. - And pity the poor post-great\nwho has to dash back to his lab 1\nTours sincerely,\nWatt A. Wordsworth.\nP.S. Pardon my use of the now de plume, but it is\nhallowed with time, and is better known than\nmy name.\n(EDITOR'S won. Roaiars ^ay bo interested to know that\n\"Watt\" is still with us.)\n\n"

THE TRIALS WILL BE HELD ON:\nWEDNESDAY OCT. 10th. SATURDAY OCT. 13th. THERE WILL BE FREE TRANSPORT PROVIDED, LEAVING THE\nUNION, PRINCE CONSORT ROAD, at 1.30 p.m. on Mob. day.\nATHLETICS An athletic team from I.C. toured the Oslo area of\nNorway during the vacation. At the time of going to\npress a full report had not been made available to our\nSports Editor and what we know of the tour we have\ngleaned from scraps of conversation.\nAs with all I.C. tours abroad, this tour was most\nsuccessful, both from the athletic and social point of\nview. To publish the assorted tales we have heard would\ndetract from the value of a first hand account wh i oh should appear in next edition.\nMOUNTAINEERING The Mountaineering Club holds a strong position\nin I.C. sporting and social life. At present some of\nthis strength may be attributed to the interest created by the projected Karakoram Expedition next Summer. Everyone in the Karakoram party, wh i oh is being\nled by Eric Sbipton, will need mountaineering ability.\nWe understand that there will be a General Meeting and Illustrated Talk by Dennis Kemp on Monday Oct.\n15th. The title will be \"Mountaineering, Climbing and\nCaving.\" On the 20th. and 21st. of this month there\nwill be a Freshers' Climbing Meet in North Wales.\nBOXING Owing to the delay in completing the Union gym-nasi um, the Boxing Club will be holding joint meetings\nwith the University of London Boxing Club at the U.L. U. gym. in Malet St. Training sessions with tuition by\nCharlie Elliot are held at the following times:\nMonday: 8.00 - 9.30 p.m. Thursday: 5.30 - 7.00 p.m. and will oom men oe on the 11th. October. Novices of all weights are welcome and will no doubt be amply reward-ed, for, as fresher s will learn to their costs, folk\nare apt to be press-ganged into competing in the Rector's Cup tournament wh i oh is held at the end of the\nSpring Term.\nROWING The Boat Club have sent us no report for\nthis issue. We can, however, divulge that they\ndid not do as well as usual at Henley this\nSummer. Also, we regret to report that the\nCaptain-Elect, Paul Harding, p ranged once more\nand has left us for good.\nRUGBY The Rugger Club has worn the U.L. Oup four times i a the last five years. This year, as well as winning the\nLine out in last year's cup final when we beat\nU. C.60.U.L. C< ip again (we hope), we are touring Cornwall at\nEaster when we are playing Penryn, Fz, & N. and Falmouth.\nWe hope to maintain the high standard of the o lub by\nblending the talents of the fresher s with the experience\nof the 'old lags'. Apart from their prowess on the\nfield, the ruggero lub are seo on d only to the Cricket\nClub in their sociability after the game.\nWe run six Fifteens, so there is room for all who\nwish to play. - If it is sport you want, join the\nRugger Club - and the I.C. definition of 'sport* will\nbecome more apparent as your stay in I.C. lengthens.\n(Editorial Note: Too much 'sport'\nstay considerably S) will lengthen your\nSOCCER The soccer club hope for an improvement on last\nseason, when I.C.'s record was only moderate although\nwe were only narrowly beaten in the 3emi final of the\nU.L. Cup. This improvement can be achieved if players\nmake a3 e riou s endeavour to get themselves match fit. Competition for positions in the 1st. XI will be keen\nand fitness will be necessary for selection\nIt is hoped that as many fresher s as possible\nwill turn up to the trials at Harlington. Selection\nof outstanding players from about 100 fresher s is\nvery difficult after only two trials and therefore\nanyone who believes he should have an immediate place\nin the tst. XI should not be discouraged if he is\nselected for the lower teams initially. The Club\nwill run four teams regularly throughout the season,\neach competing in the University League.\nThis year it is the turn of the Soooer Club for\na foreign tour. The destination has not yet been\ndecided, but all participants will be assured of an\nenjoyable time.\nCRICKET An account of the Cricket Club's TOUR OF\nDBVON is given on page FIVE, column one.\nPubliibcd by th* FEUX BOAMD.
