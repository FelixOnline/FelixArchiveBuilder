    "content": "So, just a few days ago, Bandcamp announced that\nthey will henceforth be under the watchful eye of\nEpic Games. For those unaware of either of these two\ncompanies, Bandcamp is (was?) a platform on which\nartistscouldselltheirmusic\u2013bothdigitallyinFLAC/\nMP3 format, and physically as CDs, LPs and even cas-settes. They even offered a vinyl printing service for\nsmaller artists wanting to have their music on a shiny\nblack disk as well. The best part, though, was that on\naverage, 82% of the money a user spent on the website\nwent straight to the artists they were supporting. Contrast this to the most \u2018artist friendly\u2019 streaming service,\nTIDAL, which gives an extra bonus to your top artist\nevery month, and it\u2019s easy to see why Bandcamp was\nconsidered the absolute best way to directly support\nartists that otherwise don\u2019t get that big of a payout\nfrom streaming services, better even than heading to\nyour local record store and picking up the LP from\nthere!\nEpic Games, meanwhile, is a game development\ncompany, obviously. They\u2019re most famous for the\nwidely successful Fortnite Battle Royale which made\nthem$1billioninninemonthsfromthegame\u2019srelease\nin September 2017 from microtransactions alone.\nThey also made the widely adopted and renowned\nUnrealgameengine,which,alongwithUnity,isoneof\nthe most popular commercially available game engines\non the market today. Needless to say, Epic Games is\na pretty large company with lots of value behind\nit \u2013 though up until now, most of their acquisitions\nhave been solely game-related. Their acquisition of\nBandcamp is a strange outlier to this trend.\nOf course, the tale of a small company getting\nacquired by a monolithic megacorporation is nothing\nnew. Epic has promised that Bandcamp will remain\nfunctionally independent, with their revenue model\ncontinuing to work the same way it always has.\nBandcamp Fridays, where all revenue fees are waived\nby the company, will remain as well. But count me\namongst those skeptical about whether Epic will stay\ntruetotheirwordovertheyears.Epic\u2019slargestinvestor,\nTencent, has a 9% stake in Spotify, which (I\u2019m sorry\nto say) is the Evil Co. of music streaming. Besides\nthis, one of the best things about Bandcamp was its\ntrue independence of sorts. It was a haven from the\notherwise brutal nature of the modern music industry\nwhere you could be guaranteed that you were indeed\nsupporting the artists you were listening to.\nNow with Epic in charge, and obviously a media\ngiant with its fingers in every pie like Tencent pulling\nsome strings too, I no longer think I\u2019ll be sure in that\nbelief when buying through Bandcamp. Or at the very\nleast, I don\u2019t think that it will stay \u2018The best by a long,\nlong way\u2019 forever. It is, unfortunately, in the nature of\ncapitalism to extract every morsel of value possible\nfrom the creative talent behind music, as history has\ntaught us with regards to the predatory contracts of\nthe largest record labels around. I\u2019d suggest to folks\nwanting to give support to their favourite artists, to go\nand take advantage of Bandcamp while it\u2019s still around\nin its present form. Who knows what the \u2018Epic Music\nStore\u2019 and its revenue model will look like in a year.\n21\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nDon\u2019t miss the gig\n- Double Big Band\nConcert @ Great Hall,\n19th March\nRemember not to miss Imperial\nCollege Big Band\u2019s double big band\nperformance in conjunction with\nthe Syd Lawrence Orchestra.\nView online here!\nFlorence + the Machine\u2019s\nsingle, \u201cKing\u201d, is the\nband\u2019s most recent\nfeminist anthem\nillustrating the differences\nthe singer has with her partner about the kinds\nof lives they lead: \u201cWe argue in the kitchen about\nwhether to have children/About the world ending\nand the scale of my ambition\u201d.

You spend years building\nup encyclopedic knowledge on them, and then they\u2019re\ngone and it\u2019s outdated and into the museum of memories it goes. So here\u2019s a list of songs about long lost\nfriends.\nalways, I\u2019ll care by Jeremy Zucker\nIntrueZuckerfashion, \u201calways,i\u2019llcare\u201disaheavenly\ntune written from the deepest parts of his heart. With\na delicate piano introduction, \u201calways, i\u2019ll care\u201d sets the\nstage for Zucker\u2019s angelic vocals that come to life in the\nmelodic chorus. Against the airy beats, Zucker sings\nabout platonic love and makes a meaningful promise\nto his dear friends.\nWhite Ferrari by Frank Ocean\n\u201cWhite Ferrari\u201d is four verses, no hooks, and all\nemotional gut.\nThe song bleeds\nfrom the first\nwords. It feels like\najourneythrough\na longstanding\nfool\u2019s errand, one\nwe all embark on\ndespite knowing\nbetter. \u201cI care\nfor you still and\nI will forever /\nThat was my part\nof the deal, honest / We got so familiar.\u201d Perhaps the\nthree most painful lines on \u201cWhite Ferrari,\u201d here, Frank\nOcean deals with regret and memory within memory.\nhope ur ok by Olivia Rodrigo\nForthewholealbumtofeelveryteenageangst-y(as\nit should be allowed to be and does so amazingly) and\nthenendwithhopeurok-aboutmissingoldfriendsand\nbeing distanced from them that it\u2019s not the same and\nyou can\u2019t find that familiarity but you still love them\nand wish them well and hope with your entire being\nthat they\u2019re okay. That even if it\u2019s been years you hope\ntheyknowhowproudofthemyouarefromadistance.\nHow happy you are that they got wherever they\nwanted to go or are continuing to move forward. Just\nthesenseofallthewaysdistanceandtimecandissipate\na friendship and\nyet they still\nmatter so much\nto you. the love\nyou have is still\nthere. You still\ncare, like that\u2019s\nnot a strictly\nadult emotion,\nbut it becomes\nmore apparent\nand common as\nyou get older.\nAnd to take an album riddled with anger and hurt\nand frustration and end on something as simple and\ncomplex as love\u2014that love is tangled and threaded\nthroughout the album and all the feelings of it\u2014is so\ngood and powerful and her ability to write about all\nof these feelings so succinctly and vividly! Yes, Olivia!\nYes!\nThe Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get\nUs! By Sufjan Stevens\nThe song starts with this beautiful, sweet and soft\nmelody, spilled among acoustic guitars, flutes and\ncellos, to which\nSufjan Steven\u2019s\nvoice matches\nperfectly. These\nsoft yellow\nsounds keep\ngrowing to\nevolve into\na beautiful\noverwhelming\norchestra that\nmakes the scenes\nin your head get\nmore and more\ntangible in a matter of seconds. To a relationship that\nis now dead, this song remains, as a beautiful three-minute-long revival \u2014 a homage \u2014 to never let that\npersondieinyourmind.Nottoromanticizetheperson\nstrictly, but everything good in the whole experience\nitself, just like Sufjan reminds you, \u201cmy friend is gone,\nhe ran away, I can tell you I love him each day\u201d.\nThe Asp at\nMy Chest by The\nPains of Being\nPure at Heart\n\u201cSerpent friend\nof mine/ your\nvenom sweet as\nwine\u201d, with this\nbeginning, \u2018The\nAsp at My Chest\u2019 is\nan impressionistic\nand atmospheric track featuring a slow, entrancing\ntempo and the group\u2019s signature hypnotic vocal blend,\nwhich, along with the hissing percussion, create quite a\nserpentine effect.\nMUSIC\nslide guitars around every corner and harmonicas in\nevery nook and cranny. Lead singer Neil Smith\u2019s soft\nvocals have told many stories throughout the band\u2019s\ndiscography but in this third outing they seem to have\nfound the place where they belong. Sparkling lead\nguitar, campfire acoustic rhythms, and country-style\ndrums combine bewitchingly to provide the mellow\nbacking for Smith\u2019s tales of love and loneliness and\nheartbreak.\nAs much as I love the singles that the band released\nin the run up to the album (I\u2019m looking at you \u2018Up\nGranville\u2019), the standout tracks for me are ones that\ndidn\u2019t reach our ears until the album release date. \u2018Give\nUp Baby Go\u2019 epitomises the new sound that Peach Pit\nexplore on the new album. It\u2019s bouncy, it\u2019s fun, and \u2013 as\nwith most Peach Pit songs \u2013 it has a certain melancholy\nin the lyrics. The lead guitar has a perfect jumpy trebly\npart in the song which I like to imagine being sung in\nthe middle of nowhere in the Rocky Mountains.\nThe whole album encapsulates this sense of\nisolation and wilderness. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s down to\nthe pandemic and the way the band wrote their parts\n- perhaps affected by restrictions or if it\u2019s down to\nfinding a sound that they love and has been produced\nonpurpose.Whetherthenewdirectionofthebandwas\npurposeful or circumstantial, I can\u2019t say but either way\nit works beautifully. From 2 to 3 is the most personal\nand relatable album Peach Pit has released to date. The\nstripped back sound of many songs such as \u2018Last Days\nofLonesome\u2019andthelonging\u2018EverythingAboutYou\u2019fits\nSmith\u2019s voice to a tee.\nIn my opinion, this Peach Pit album has finally\nfoundasoundthatworksforeveryoneintheband.The\nsound comes so naturally that everything else fits into\nplace, creating an impressive record that I\u2019m looking\nforward to watching live on May 19th.\n\n"

Taking the tabloid reporting with\nthe customary pinch of salt, I reached\nout to the team to ask their thoughts on\nthe matter, not knowing what to expect.\nSuffice to say, the team does not see it\nthat way. Far from the Mays-dominated\nnarrative that the papers would have you\nbelieve, our hour-long chat became a\ncasual meander through different topics,\nwith each member of the team pitching\nin when they had something to add.\nIf anything, the most outspoken were\nFatima and Max, the two who Twitter\nhad portrayed as sidelined by Michael.\n\u201cThis has something that really seems\nto have risen in the last two years\u201d said\nGilbert. \u201cTwitter has become much\nmore vocal in criticising students\u201d.\n\u201cI think it comes from a good\nplace\u201d added Michael. \u201cPeople are\nconcerned about diversity in UC and\nthe historical lack of it, but sometimes\nit just comes out the wrong way\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating\u201d said Fatima, \u201cI\nshouldn\u2019t have to go on Twitter to let\npeopleknowthatI\u2019mnotavictim.There\nneeds to be a bit more critical thinking\u201d.\nI asked them what they thought\nhad changed in the past two years\nthat meant things were so much\nmore heated on social media now.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s been stuck inside for two\nyears\u201d said Fatima, \u201cI guess they\u2019ve had\nmore time on their hands for things\nlike this. I remember when I was just\na viewer there were moments I\u2019d seen\non older series where it appeared that\nwomenwerebeingignoredbymaleteam\nmates and I actually tweeted something\nsimilar to the stuff we\u2019ve been getting\u201d.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve found funny is that there\u2019s\nanobsessionofsomepeoplethatMichael\nand I are in a homoerotic relationship\u201d\nsaid Gilbert to much laughter. \u201cTo be\nclearforthepaper,we\u2019renot\u201d.Oneofthe\ntweets highlighted by the Mail was \u201cIf\nMays went on Mastermind his specialist\nsubject would be Jackson\u2019s eyes\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a degree of editing\nwithin the programme, and each team\nonly has two cameras on them. Half the\ntime you can\u2019t even see me because the\ncamera is focussed on Max and Fatima,\nand then close-ups tend to show a divide\nthat\u2019s not really there\u201d said Michael.\nFatimaadded\u201csoonafterourteamwas\nformed we decided what our specialist\ntopics would be and focussed on them.\nWetrytohaveaslittleoverlapaspossible\nbetween subjects to maximise efficiency.\nThis is something viewers don\u2019t seem\nto realise and then pile on when it\nlooks like someone\u2019s being ignored.\nThe Birmingham team received similar\ncriticism when it looked like a female\nmember of the team was being ignored,\nbut she was a science specialist and none\nof the questions were related to science\u201d.\nMax opened my eyes to further\nconflict surrounding the team which\nI\u2019d not come across, having only done\na preliminary Google search and\nassuming that was the extent of it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done interviews with the\nSingaporean versions of the BBC and\nThe Times\u201d he said. \u201cAfter those went\nout, clips of me on the show got seven-digit views online. Some Singaporeans\non the internet feel the need to flag-wave\nwhenever the country is mentioned\nin the West. I\u2019ve had YouTube\ncomments describing me as \u201cthe rise\nof East Asia\u201d and that I \u2018represent the\neconomy of China on the world stage\u2019\u201d.\n\u201cPeople have also quite crudely tried\nto guess where I\u2019m from\u201d added Fatima.\n\u201cThey say things like \u2018she looks Indian\nCredit: Fatima Sheriff\n\n"

Though the\nreason is officially that it\nwas a reasonable reward\nfor five years of service\nin the cabinet under two\nprime ministers, anonymous\nNumber 10 sources told The\nTimes that the award was \u201chard\nto justify\u201d and appeared \u201ccorrupt\u201d.\nFurther to this, reasoning given to\nThe Times added \u201cthe announcement\nwas delayed because ministers did\nnot want Williamson to be knighted\nwhile a 2020 Christmas party in the\nDepartment of Education was being\ninvestigated by Sue Gray\u2019s inquiry\ninto gatherings during the pandemic.\nIn January the Metropolitan Police\ndecided not to investigate the event,\nclearing the way for Williamson\u2019s\nknighthood\u201d.What\u2019smore,theyadded\n\u201cthat announcing the knighthood\nwhilewarragesinUkraineisalsolikely\nto minimise the political backlash\u201d.\nWhat is going on? The government\nsneaking a knighthood through, for\na crony who already had a CBE, in\nwhat we can assume is a bid to keep\nhim from causing trouble on the back\nbenches following his removal from\nCabinetintheSeptember\u201821reshuffle.\nWilliamson held the roles of Chief\nWhip and Defence Secretary in the\nMay government, which gives reason\nto why the government would worry\nabout the damage he could cause.\nI believe Williamson was the worst\nmember of the last Cabinet in terms\nof performance and public disgrace.\nUnder May he was sacked over a leak\nof sensitive information pertaining to\nHuawei from the National Security\nCouncil. Amidst many minor\nblunders, he is most\nnotable in recent memory\nfor overseeing the socalled \u2018exam fiasco\u2019,\nwhere A-Levels awarded\nin 2020 according to an\nalgorithm, that had been\nin the works for months,\ngave results glaringly biased\ntowards students of private\nschools. Williamson rapidly U-turned\nand announced that teacher predicted\ngrades would be used instead of those\nawarded by the algorithm, saying that\nhe\u2019d only just realised the built-in\nbias, despite the Commons Education\nCommittee warning months before\nthat it would cause \u201cinaccuracy\nand bias against young people\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds\u201d.\nNoneofitmakessense.Backtoback\nreasons essentially all just saying \u201cwe\ndon\u2019t want bad press over this\u201d, and\nthen seemingly multiple sources from\nNumber 10 dish out the most corrupt\nreasoning you could think of.

It tells the story of three teenage\nNative Americans willing to escape the hard life\nthat awaits them on an Indian Navajo reservation.\nFreeland does an excellent job at bringing to life such\na touching story, with the characters feeling like real\npeople on the screen. At the core of the movie is\nrespect for cultural traditions and explores the idea of\ngender. Give this film a chance if you can!\nwith the 13th, Ava DuVernay became the first\nBlack woman director to be nominated in the\nOscars in 2017 in the Best Documentary category.\nThis documentary gathers real life experiences about\nthe prison system in the United States and takes a\ndeep dive on the nation\u2019s history of racial inequality.

Winning several Academy Awards last\nyear, this overall quiet movie explores an alteranate\nto living in a city, being a nomad, or as explained by\nFern the main character, being houseless - which is\nnot a synonim to being homeless. Very personal and\nintimate stories from the actors in the film will surely\nmake you question philosophic aspects about dealing\nwith grief and life after retirement.\nNow streaming on Netflix, the second feature\ndirected by Freeland called Deidra & Laney Rob\na Train.

    "content": "Adiscarded rocket launcher belonging to the launch vehicle Long\nMarch 3C, believed to be a part of the\nthird stage of China\u2019s lunar mission\nChang\u2019e 5-T1, crashed into the far side\nof the moon on 4th March 2022, impacting precisely at 12:26 GMT.\nThe China National Space Administration (CNSA) launched the\nChang\u2019e 5-T1 spacecraft to the moon in\nOctober 2014, with the payload being\ntransported by the Long March 3C rocket and consisting of three stages. One of\nthe three stages, a spent rocket booster,\nhas been sent on a highly elliptical orbit around Earth since the launch, with\nthe 3-tonne rocket part eventually impacting the Moon at a speed of approximately 9200 m/s (5,700 mph). This\nspacecraft served as a forerunner to CNSA\u2019s Chang\u2019e 5, the 2020 mission that\nperformed a robotic lunar sample which\nwas returned to Earth.\nInitially, amateur astronomers\nthought it may have belonged to an upper-stagerocketfromSpaceX\u2019sFalcon 9,\nwhich helped launch the Deep Space\nClimate Observatory Satellite in 2015.\nIt was then confirmed, by NASA, that\nthe booster did indeed belong to the\nChang\u2019e 5-T1 booster, with the Space\nAgency stating: \u201cThe booster used to\nlaunch Chang\u2019e 5-T1 went into a highly\nelliptical Earth orbit after launch. Some\ncalculations show it is on a trajectory\nto impact the far side of the Moon on\nMarch 4, 2022, although China\u2019s foreign ministry has denied this identifica-tion, stating that the booster had already\nburned up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nEstimated time of impact for the object\nis 12:26 UT (7:26 a.m. EST), estimated position at latitude 5.18 N, longitude 233.55 E.\u201d\nThe rocket is believed to have impacted near the Hertzsprung crater, a lunar\ncrater consisting of a 570 km diameter\non the far side of the moon, with the\ncollision creating a plume of dust that\nmakes this unplanned event a delight\nfor planetary scientists. Once the dust\nsettles from this collision, NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will move\ninto position to get an up-close view of\nthe impact site and\nhopefully shed some\nlight on the physics\nof impacts in space.\nThe camera on board\nthe orbiter will take\npictures of the impact\nsite with a resolution\nof 1 metre per pixel.\nThe shape and ejected\ndust from the crater\ncould return insights\nas to how the rocket\nwas oriented at the\nmoment of impact.\nOn top of this, the\namount of heat generated from the impact\nwill also be of valuable\ninformation. There\u2019s\na possibility that the\nlunar orbiter\u2019s infrared instrument will\nbe able to calculate the total amount of\nheat inside the crater, and thus the total\namount of heat from the impact. Comparing before and after images of the\norbiter camera\u2019s findings and infrared\nheat sensor, scientists will look for any\nother subtle changes to the surface of\nthe moon. Planetary impacts and crater\nformation are a pervasive and prevalent\nphenomenon in our solar system. With\nthe physics of planetary impacts currently being poorly understood, observing\nthe data from Chang\u2019e 5-T1 booster\u2019s\nimpact site will hopefully provide new\ninsights that will prove critical to future\nmissions to the Moon and beyond.\nWhilst the collision can be hailed\nas an \u201cexciting research opportunity\u201d,\nthere\u2019s no escaping the fact that space\nagencies are facing a prevalent issue regarding such \u201cspace junk\u201d\u2013hardware\ndiscarded from missions that have run\nout of fuel or energy to return to Earth.\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) estimates there are now 36,500 pieces of\nspace junk larger than 10 cm, with 1 million objects ranging from 1-10 cm and\n130 million objects ranging from 1 mm\nto 1 cm estimated to be rogue in Earth\norbit. About 630 break-ups, explosions,\ncollisions, or anomalous events resulting\nin fragmentation have also been estimated by the ESA. These statistics are damning since only 6180 rockets (excluding\nfailures) have been launched since the\nstart of the space age in 1957.\nA number of organisations, which\ninclude the US military, use radar to\ntrack objects in Earth orbit\u2013but almost\nno one tracks space junk once it leaves\nEarth orbit. Satellites are too small,\nbright objects such as the moon and sun\nmake them difficult to track once they\nare too far away. With a further 15 missions currently scheduled to launch to\nthe moon this year, it\u2019s clear more must\nbe done to avoid another accidental impactor in space. It\u2019s suggested that better\nregulations for the proper disposal of\nspace junk should be imposed for future\nspace missions, such as requiring rocket\nstages to perform manoeuvres that propel them into solar orbits, rather than\nelliptical orbits which leave satellites to\ntumble between the moon and Earth.\nThis solution, however, is quite heavy\nand expensive, as it requires additional fuel. Ongoing research at the ESA is\nexploring new, innovative ways of dealing with space junk. The space agency is\ndeveloping a subsystem that can be attached to a satellite which slowly unfurls\na large aluminium-coated polyamide\nmembrane, attached to four carbon-fi-bre reinforced booms, which is initiated once the subsystem recognises that\nthe satellite has come to the end of its\nmission or has failed (for example if lost\nsignal for a month). This membrane essentially acts like a sail, inducing a drag\neffect causing the space craft to decrease\nits orbital speed much faster than traditional de-orbiting techniques.\nSpace-junk clean up matters. 2590\ninactive satellites are still orbiting the\nEarth in space. Whilst the lunar collision posits an exciting research opportu-nity, it still emphasises the growing need\nto manage our space junk. Going for-ward, it\u2019s important to consider that the\nsustainability of space is pivotal in our\nfuture missions to the moon and interplanetary missions & spaceflight overall.\nOur \u201cspace environment\u201d, is just as significant as our environment on Earth.\nOngoingresearchconductedbytheESA\nand other space agencies alike recognise\nthis issue. This recognition is critical, as\nby 2030, some estimates show that more\nthan 100,000 satellites could orbit our\nplanet. We\u2019re in a fortunate position,\nthough, as unlike many of our industrial processes on Earth, we are equipped\nwith the knowledge and tools to resolve\nthe situation before the accumulation of\nspace junk will make outer space, quite\nlike our earth, unsustainable.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nTaylor Pomfret Science Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nAbandoned Chinese rocket launcher\n\u2018Long March 3C\u2019 crashes into the Moon\nWhat\u2019s being done to clean up space junk?\nTopographic map acquired by Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter of\nHertzsprung Crater: the impact site of the Long March 3C booster.\nPhoto credit: NASA\n\n"

I don\u2019t\nwant to overwhelm anyone, but\nit\u2019s quite a lot. Plastic polymers were\ncreated for their sturdiness, malleability,\nlightness and low cost. According\nto Plastics Europe, plastic is a \u201cterm\ncommonly used to describe a wide range\nof synthetic or semi-synthetic materials\nthatareusedinahugeandgrowingrange\nofapplications.\u2026Therawmaterialsused\nto produce plastics are natural products\nsuch as cellulose, coal, natural gas, salt\nand, of course, crude oil.\u201d\nThe low cost of plastics has enabled\nthe emergence of single-use items where\nconvenience and low cost overtake\nreusable items. This has been convenient\nfor medicine and increased the safety\nof some processes and interventions.\nThis got me wondering, for instance,\nwhat medicine used for IV drips before\nplastics\u2014the answer: reusable rubber\nthat gets cleaned or glass. However, the\nuse of plastics has gone far beyond what\nis necessary, with almost every product\nbeing available in plastic.\nTo assess the impact of our plastics\non the planet, you need to consider the\nLife Cycle of the product: this involves\nevaluating how it is produced, used and\ndiscarded to quantify the impact.\nPlasticsstartasapolymer,asexplained\nabove, and is subsequently transported\nto be manufactured. The product is then\nused, discarded, put in landfill, burnt for\nenergy recovery or recycled. It is cheap\nand produced for a high growth linear\nmodel. Therefore, the cost does not bear\nthe social and environmental cost of the\nproduce.\nThe durability of plastics means\nthey do not biodegrade into nontoxic elements. Plastic breaks down\nor degrades after centuries into\ntiny plastic or powder elements \u2013\nmicroplastics. Calling fossil oil-based\nplastic compostable or biodegradable is\nfalse. This very property of plastic has\ncaused a widespread plastic and micro-plastic overflow, considering that 90%\nof plastics ever created have not been\nrecycled. At the current growth rate, the\nplastic industry could be responsible for\n20% of all oil consumption.\nSo what\u2019s the alternative? Bioplastics\nhavegrowninpopularityandmayreplace\noil-based plastics in their previous uses.\nBioplastics are plastic materials\nproduced from renewable biomass\nsources, such as vegetable fats and oils,\ncorn starch, straw, woodchips, sawdust,\nrecycledfoodwaste,etc.,insteadoffossil-based. Bioplastics can be compostable,\nbiodegradable or recyclable. Although\nbio is in the name, this is due to its\nmanufacturingfrombio-basedelements,\nnot its biodegradability. Some plastics\nareacombinationofboth,whichdoesn\u2019t\nseem to make sense to me. For example,\nCoca cola\u2019s \u2018PlantBottle\u2122\u2018 uses less fossil\nfuel but isn\u2019t biodegradable; with this\nmisleading name, my greenwashing\nradar is going red. Recycling bioplastics\nis an option put forward by companies,\nbut they cannot be recycled with fossil-fuel plastics. Instead, the bioplastics\nwill be recycled together. Therefore,\nthis method requires differentiating the\nplastics from the bioplastic and having\na good enough recycling system to have\nseparate streams.\nCompostable material is certified to\nbreak down into non-toxic elements.\nIt does so at a predictable rate and may\nneed certain conditions such as high\nhumidity or temperature. This can be\nat home or in an industrial compost site\nwith a specific temperature or moisture\nlevel. Microorganisms break it down\ninto carbon dioxide, water, inorganic\ncompounds and biomass at the same\nrate as other organic materials in the\ncompost pile, leaving no toxic residue.\nIt is independently certified to prove its\ncompostable status.\nBiodegradability is the capacity\nfor biological degradation of organic\nmaterials by living organisms, down\nto the base substances such as water,\ncarbon dioxide, methane and basic\nelements. So all compostable plastic is\nbiodegradable, but not all biodegradable\nplastic is compostable. Furthermore, it\nis fairly misleading because there is no\nrequirementfornotleavingtoxicresidue\nduring the decomposition process.\nNeither compostable nor\nbiodegradable bioplastics will\nbiodegrade in landfills due to the lack\nof oxygen, light and bacteria. Instead,\nthey may release methane as food scraps\ndo in landfills. So you get difficulty in\nassessing these bioplastics. They also do\nnotbiodegradeintheoceanorforestetc.\nSome biodegradable plastics do not\ndisappear but become too small to be\nseen (oxo-degradable). To be called\nbiodegradable, they should become\nnutrients. They damage the recycling\nquality if mixed with plastics during\nthe recycling process. The European\nCommission banned them as it is not\nconsidered a solution to the plastic\nproblem.\nTo avoid misleading consumers,\ncompanies should quantify any\nenvironmental benefits claimed. While\nthere are applications where bio-based plastics may be excellent, such\nevaluations should be based on life cycle\nassessments(LCAs)andnotonsimplistic\nassumptions or claims that \u2018bio\u2019 signifies\nlower environmental impact. Further\nimprovement in the LCA methodology\nshould be researched.\nFor instance, in assessing life cycle\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,\nNova Institute (2017) calculated GHG\nemission reductions of around 27%\n(relative to fossil fuels) in producing\nPLA, while Shen et al. (2011) estimated\nthat assembling PET bottles from\nbioplastic emits on average 25% fewer\nGHGs. Furthermore, comparing fossil\nand bio-based PET bottles, Chen et al.\n(2016) suggested a potential reduction\nin global warming potential of 21%\nwhen using woody biomass relative to\nfossil fuels.\nMy suggestion is to avoid single-use\nitems as much as possible. When using\nbiodegradable or compostable items, use\nthem instead of plastic packaging and\nlook at how to dispose of them. This is\neither through an industrial compost\nfacility or a home compost. If you do not\nhaveaccesstoaseparatecompostfacility,\nthis is still a better option. Still, the lack\nof appropriate disposal options seems\nthat it could outweigh the advantages\nby releasing methane and using more\nresources other than plastic.\nThe production of the item does\nremove CO2 through the growth of\nthe crop but also uses resources such\nas land, water and transport. The\nbiggest drawback may be growing the\ncrop instead of food in lower-income\ncountries. The big issue with plastics\nis the disposal mentality making us go\nthrough so much and not recycle. We\nneedtoeducatetheusersthatbioplastics\ncannot be disposed of in the streets or\nrivers.\nHowever, I believe the composting\noptions will increase worldwide,\nenabling us to make the most out of\nbioplastics. Given that toxins released\nfrom plastic are still largely unknown\nin their impact, it would be wise to\nreevaluate the uncontrolled use and\ndisposal of plastics.\nLea Haber Sustainability Writer\nCredit: Naja Bertolt Jensen, Unsplash\n\n"

    "content": "birds). A decrease in prey eventually\nresults in insufficient sustenance for the\nnumber of mesopredators in the habitat,\nand their population would decline as\nwell. The loss of growth stimulation by\nherbivorous species\u2019 also causes flora\nto be stunted and disappear, and in\nthis way the entire ecosystem can shut\ndown, leaving a barren, uninhabitable\nlandscape in its stead.\nThis is bleakly illustrated in the film,\nbut ultimately natural order is restored\nas Simba is reinstated as \u2018King\u2019, with\nthe post-war and post-fire Savannah\nflourishing again. Nature does have\nthe capacity to bounce back, but only\nif we allow it to\u2014the perpetuity of\nhuman activity means that often, when\nnatural ecosystems are destroyed, they\nare eliminated until there is no more\ngrounding for regrowth and restoration.\nHowever, there is still some hope on\nthe restoration front; Indonesian\norganisation \u2018Blue Corner Marine\nResearch\u2019 has found ways to encourage\nnew coral reefs to grow around their\nislands, and the once-near-extinct\ntakhis (wild horses) now thrive on\nthe Mongolian steppe, where there is\nlimitedhumandevelopment.Coralreefs\nand takhis are crucial to their respective\necosystems\u2014the reefs providing homes,\nhideouts, and nutrition for other aquatic\ncreatures, while takhis stimulate plant\ngrowth and support the survival of\nsmaller animals through winter periods.\nIt is these kinds of balanced, mutualistic\nrelationships that we must aim to\npreserve in the world\u2019s ecosystems.\n\u2018Fire is a killer. Sometimes, what\u2019s\nleft behind can grow better than the\ngeneration before\u2026if given the chance.\u2019\n\u2013 Simba\nAgain, in the context of the film\u2019s\nplot, this line is primarily a metaphor for\ninter-priderelations.However,theliteral\nmeaning of the metaphor is realistic\u2014it\nhas been shown that wild forest fires\npromote fuller, healthier growth once\nextinguished\u2014provided remnants of\nlife are still present\u2014by targeting unruly\ndiseases and insect populations. The\ncrucial part of the line is this\u2014\u2018if given\nthe chance\u2019. The world\u2019s ecosystems\nhave the capacity to grow back and\nflourish, but driving their constituents\nto extinction eliminates that possibility.\nA prime example of this recovering\ncapacity is in the \u2018Exclusion Zone\u2019 of\nthe 1986 Chernobyl disaster, described\nin David Attenborough\u2019s \u2018A Life on Our\nPlanet\u2019. There is some morbid irony in\nhumans being driven out by a man-made\naccident, but miraculously it allowed\nsurrounding forests and surviving\nwildlife to creep back in and reclaim\ntheir land. Herds of the same takhis\n(also known as Przewalski\u2019s horses)\nthat were reintroduced in Mongolia\nare also living contentedly, alongside\nbrown bears, lynx, deer, badgers, birds,\nand many more, in the Chernobyl\nexclusion zone that was expected to\nbe uninhabitable for thousands of\nyears. This phenomenon is mirrored in\nthe exclusion zone of Fukushima and\nproves that human intervention is only\nnecessitated by our own existence and\nerrors. So surely it is our duty to mitigate\nourcollectiveimpactonthisearthbyany\nmeans necessary. The Angkor temples\nin Cambodia are another example of\npost-human areas that are now home to\nrehabilitated wildlife such as monkeys\nand otters, with ancient stone buildings\nengulfedbyhuge\u2018strangler\u2019andsilktrees.\nIt is a testament to nature\u2019s adaptability\nthat it is unperturbed by the presence\nof man-made structures, and that such\nadaptability can be overshadowed by\nhuman oppression shows the gravity of\nour influence.\nUnfortunately, humanity has lost\ntouch with nature to the extent that\nmany of us are bound in unsustainable\nways of living\u2014even those of us that\nstrive for eco-friendliness struggle to\nmaintain it in today\u2019s world. Nowhere\nin The Lion King is there a fitting\nanalogy for the concept of money and\nconsumerism, and I believe this reflects\nhow unnatural it is.\nConsumerism is truly a societal\nconstruct, and one that we are all\nconstrained to; it is too ingrained to be\nstamped out. Our reliance on the media\nis also detrimental; mainstream news\noutlets don\u2019t highlight environmental\nissues and solutions nearly enough\nand social media acts as a sneaky\nperpetrator of consumerist values. The\ndesire for continual acceleration of\neconomic development is inviting our\nown downfall; sustainably produced\ngoods are exorbitantly priced and fossil\nfuels still reign supreme. Spotlighting\ngreenhouse gas emissions allows current\nproduction practices to continue as long\nas they are seemingly \u2018carbon offset\u2019\nor \u2018carbon neutral\u2019, bypassing other\nissues such as resource management\nand habitat destruction. Technologies\nlike carbon capture and nuclear fusion\nreactors are still in their infancy, but we\nneed remedies now, and they need to be\nholistic.\nPersonally,Ifeelasrestrictedasanyone\nelse by society\u2019s existing format, and that\nchanging my lifestyle won\u2019t have much\nimpact while actionable power still\nlies overwhelmingly in politicians\u2019 and\nCEOs\u2019 hands. Nevertheless, I still make\nsome effort to live more sustainably. In\nlieu of becoming tree-hugging hermits\ndeprived of everyday comforts, I urge\nyou to try at least one of the following:\n1. Recall and implement the 3 R\u2019s\n(reduce, reuse, recycle, in case you\nneeded reminding).\n2. Be a conscious consumer; maybe\nspend a little less on unnecessary/\nsuperficial items, a little more on eco-friendly essentials.\n3. Read up about climate change and\necology, and not just the depressing\nstuff\u2014the optimistic too.\n4. Simply consider the planet, your\nplace in it, and how you might be\nimpacting it throughout your day.\nYou\u2019ll naturally become more aware\nof your personal sustainability and\nconsumption habits, and you\u2019ll be all the\nbetter for it, as will Earth\u2019s Circle of Life.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n14 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\nTHIS IS NO\nLONGER SOME\nDYSTOPIAN\nFUTURE FOR US\nTO WATCH ON THE\nBIG SCREEN\n\u201c\nImage by Hans Veth, Unsplash\n\n"

    "content": "Anthony McCarten\u2019s new play about Andy Warhol\nand Jean Michel Basquiat wants to poke fun at\nthe economics of market, how feeble it is, and how\nfickle it is. Sounds from an auction are played over\nthe end of the final scene as the stage fades slowly to\nblack, familiar sounds for the real-life Warhol and\nBasquiat, whose artwork sold for millions in their\nlifetime, and even more today. Irony of ironies, Tracy\nEmin is sitting on the row in front of me. Tracy Emin\nwhose unmade bed sold for $3.77 Million in 2014. It\nwas a bit like the play within a play in Hamlet. Hamlet\nre-enacts the murder of his father with King Claudius\nin the audience, who Hamlet suspects to be the killer,\nhoping to \u201ccatch the conscience of the King\u201d by recreating the murder as accurately as possible. I surreptitiously glanced over to Emin to see if I could catch the\nconscience of the artist.\nExcept that this was not like Hamlet at all because\nthe play never mustered the courage to say anything\nmeaningful about the culture industry or anything in\nparticular. Instead, it chose to recreate caricatured versions of Warhol and Basquiat, throw them in a room,\nand give them nothing to do other than spout pseu-do-philosophical platitudes about the meaning of art.\nWithnothingdrivingthefirstact,theplaybecametiresome quickly. The second act admittedly had more to\nwrestle with. Basquiat has a break down because of the\ndeath of his friend at the hands of police brutality. We\nsee references to his heroin addiction that would eventually kill him. We see Warhol explain that he doesn\u2019t\npaint because second generation Czech immigrant Andrew Warhol paints, New York Andy Warhol makes\nprints. But there is very little narrative thread to tie\nthese concepts together to reach a genuine conclusion;\nthe two just decide to be friends because the play needs\nan emotional resolution.\nIs this some kind of post-ironic metafiction performance of one of Warhol\u2019s famously vacuous artworks\ndeliberately lacking meaning or plot I see before me?\nProbably not. In reality it is just not well written, another irony given Anthony McCarten\u2019s background as\na screenwriter. The writer is behind most big budget bi-opics from the last five years(Bohemian Rhapsody, The\nTwo Popes, Darkest Hour) McCarten has won BAFTAs\nand been nominated for two Oscars.\nOn the subject of art and money, Paul Bettany plays\nAndyWarhol.Bettanyisanactorwhoprobablydoesn\u2019t\nhave to work another day in his life now that he has\ncashed his Marvel films pay checks. Bettany gives a solid impression of Warhol, but cannot goes beyond the\nsurface to explore Warhol\u2019s depth as a character thanks\nto the limited script. His Warhol is the kind you will\nsee parodied on The Simpsons rather than a genuine human being. Jeremy Pope is less cartoonish as Basquiat.\nHe convincingly portrays the artist as someone who\ncannot cope with his demons bouncing around the\nstage with a childlike energy to deflect the inner tur-moil. The two share one moment of emotional fragili-ty: the revelation of both artist\u2019s scars, Warhol from an\nassassination attempt, Basquiat from being hit by a car.\nBut nothing becomes of the moment.\nThe problem with trying to poke fun at the relationship between art and money is that there is nothing to\nsay that people do not already know. Yes, the art market is insane. Yes, most art is subservient to market de-mand. Whether it is graffiti artists, cinematic universes,\nor Hollywood biopics, where the money goes, art will\nfollow. Just ask Tracey Emin. She did not seem to enjoy\nherself. But then again, neither did I.\nwoman, communicating a message of pure self-expres-sion and confidence.\nMaster of drag-couture, the Scottish brand House\nof Aristocrats\u2019 collection, \u201cEpitome\u201d, popped from the\ncatwalk.

    "content": "Since its conception in the latter half\nof the previous century, 3D-printing\ntechnology has developed rapidly and\nvastly expanded the realm of possibility\nforboththemanufacturingindustryand\nhobbyists alike. In 1981, Hideo Kodama\nused UV light to harden polymers into\n3D objects. Charles Hull subsequently\nhoned the process to create stereolithog-raphy, producing the first 3D printer.\nThe technique was revolutionary. Originally a method for polymer application,\nit has expanded so far that now, it is possible to print food. This method has tre-mendousadvantages,butlikealltechno-logical growth, there are some issues. It\nis vital that we do not let them outweigh\nthe positives that 3D-printing technology can provide.\nHealthcare is one field where\n3D-printing has had a tremendous im-pact. Patient-specific surgical models are\nmade using scan data, providing doctors\nwith a more effective tool for preoper-ative planning, intraoperative visualisation and fitting of medical devices. Generic models can cause complications;\ndifferences between the model and patient can cause issue in operations. The\nuse of accurate models can significantly reduce this risk. The production of\nprosthetic limbs is another bonus of 3D\nprinting technology. Prosthetic limbs\ncost anywhere from $5000 to $50,000,\nfor a 5-year period \u2013 and typically only\nlast for five years. The exorbitant price\ncannot even be justified as being a onetime expenditure. However, 3D printed\nlimbs can be sold for as little as $50. 3D\nprinting in healthcare has revolutionised\nthe industry and is continuing to do so.\nThe last decade has also seen an increase in the application of 3D printing\ntechnology to the construction industry.\nIn April 2021, a Dutch couple became\nthe first inhabitants of a completely\n3D-printed house. The most obvious\nadvantage of this construction method\nis speed. The average house takes approximately a year to produce. Chinese\ncompany, Winsun, manufactured a\n3D-printed villa complete with external\nfixtures in a mere 45 days. Increased efficiency is one of the biggest plus points\nof 3D printing technology. Another\nadvantage is that there are noticeably\nfewer restrictions to the design of build-ings. Curved buildings, while popular\namongst some, do require a great deal of\ninvestment, planning and manufacture.\nIf 3D printing is able to reduce these\ncosts, many more people will be able to\nhave the house or office they want. It\ncould also reduce the volume of waste\nproduced in construction projects, decreasing their environmental impact.\nHowever, while 3D printing has developed at a phenomenal rate, we cannot\ndismiss its problems. In its current state,\nit is much better suited to the manufacture of bespoke components, not least\nbecause of the time associated with it.\nWearestillquiteawayfromthetechnologybeingusedasaninstrumentformass\nmanufacture. Aside from the high cost\nof the printers themselves ($50,000\nfor a professional, metal printing ma-chine), the range of parts that can be\nmanufactured by 3D printing is not\nquite as large as you might think. If a\npart is designed to be under stress, 3D\nprintingiscertainlynotthebestoption.\nIt is an additive manufacturing tech-nique, where parts are created layer by\nlayer. Whilst the layers adhere together\nduring the printing process, constant\nstress is likely to cause the layers to\ndelaminate, making existing manufacture methods a much better option for\nmechanical parts. Furthermore, whilst\nindustrial grade 3D printers are to be\nmarvelledat,thoseavailableforhobby-ists still leave something to be desired.\nOver-extrusion, warping, stringing,\nblockages; 3D printing enthusiasts are\nall too familiar with these issues. Whilst\nthis technology is undoubtedly revolu-tionary, there are still some wrinkles that\nneed to be straightened out before it can\nbecome truly mainstream.\nThe problems caused by 3D printing\nare not altogether technical or linked to\nimplementation, either. It\u2019s free-for-all\nnature, in particular, is both a benefit\nand a burden. The open and free flow\nof ideas is an ideal worth pursuing, but\nthe prospect of anybody producing any\nproduct they want without regulation\nis concerning to say the least. One case\nin which this is evident is the 3D printing of contraband, specifically firearms.\nThere are no constraints on who can\npurchase 3D printers and trying to limit\nwhat can be produced on them is a futile task. This, rather\nfrighteningly, circumvents the background\nchecks which are usually carried out. Illegally\nobtained weapons cause\nenough of a problem\nin countries such as\nthe USA, where illegal\nownership of weapons\nis a major issue. While\nillegally obtained guns\nare extremely problem-atic, they can at least be\ntraced. A 3D printed\ngun, on the other hand,\ncannot be traced. Furthermore, since\n3D printing uses polymers, 3D printed\nweapons evade conventional security\nmeasures such as metal detectors.\nRight now, I sound like a pessimist,\nlisting the problems that 3D technology\npresents. I am still of the opinion that it\nis one of the most brilliant inventions\nof recent years. I am an engineering\nstudent, and there have been many instances when 3D printing has made my\nlife easier. Nevertheless, we just need to\nmake sure that this fantastic technology\nhas a positive impact on society and the\nworldwelivein,andthatitisnotusedto\ndestroy our safety and security.\nFRIDAY 11TH MARCH 2022\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n3D-Printing: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\nAnusha Narayan Science Writer\nA boon for prosthetics, 3D printing technology still faces challenges, both technical and from social misuse\nPersonalised 3D printed limbs for children\nPhoto credit: ColbyCities, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0\nConsumer grade 3D printer with completed object\nPhoto credit: Makerbot Industries, CC BY 2.0\nAn early model of 3D printed firearm, whose plans were shared\nextensively online\nPhoto credit: NotLessOrEqual, Wikimedia Commons, CC0\n\n"

Running with the slogan \u2018vote Anvesh, love Rajeshirke\u2019, Anvesh promises\nto find part time jobs for students who want them and to fund a disabled students hub.\nThe ballot box\u2019s longest serving contender goes by Zixiao Wang. Zixiao was the final holder of the position of GSU\nPresident last year, before it was dissolved by the current President\u2019s GSU review. Zixiao resigned from his seat in\ncouncil as GSU President near the end of the last academic year, though it was not clear that this was actually something\nhe could do. He resigned from the role in its entirety once he learned that a Vote of No Confidence was being raised against him.\nWang Guo is the green boy of this election cycle. A first year in the Life Sciences department, Wang has diligently\nwritten an article for the Felix Science section every week this academic year, as well as further CSP and Halls\nroles listed in his manifesto. Wang has lived in both China and Spain, and advocates for 100% in-person teaching.\nBioengineering undergraduate Ivan Busha is running for President on a platform of constant\nchange and improvement. He lists a mix of practical and holistic objectives for his time\nat the top, including improving the eActivities website and improving student support.\nTwo candidates who it\u2019s possible to perceive as having not taken the\nelections completely seriously are Suhani Gujral and William DraperBarr. Suhani chose to provide neither a campaign photo nor a manifesto,\nwhereas William has opted to keep everything Limmy-themed.\nOnly two students wish to wield the DPFS baton,\nand they are Niamh McAuley and Anvesh... again.\nNiamh has accrued experience in multiple areas of the Union, including\nthree years in 568/The Union Bar, and Arts and Ents Chair this\nyear. She is running on a platform of diversifying Union events and\nimproving response times from the Union to clubs and societies.\nAnvesh\u2019s manifesto is eerily similar to his manifesto for President.\nDeputy President\n(Finance and Services)\nHayley Wong\nAnvesh Rajeshirke\nZixiao Wang\nWang Guo\nIvan Busha\nNiamh McAuley\nAnvesh part 2\n\n"

    "content": "96 freshwater ponds sit in neat rows, brimming with water, life, and chemical pollut-ants. In Silwood Park, Professor Guy Woodward is working with these ponds to look at\nhow multiple stressors like warming, drought\nand chemical pollution affect freshwater biological systems. Ecosystems are complex, and\nwhen different stressors work together, they\ncan have unexpected consequences. Species\nlive in an interconnected food web, and different species perform different functions within\nthe ecosystem. They have different lifespans, sizes and metabolic rates that will be affected differently by stressors. Impacts on species, particularly those with important\nfunctional roles such as breaking down dead organic matter like leaves into nutrients\nthat can travel through the food web, will affect the entire ecosystem.\nThe ponds were established in 2015 with degassed tap water, sand and gravel.\nThey were \u201cseeded\u201d with organisms collected from local waters, and these communities were allowed to stabilise. The Silwood Park mesocosms have been experimentally warmed since 2018 with temperatures ranging from 1oC and 8oC above ambient\ntemperature,matchingwithclimatechangeprojections,andwith\u201cevents\u201dofperiodic extreme warming that mimic heat waves. In\n2019, chemical stressors were added. Field me-socosms provide a wonderful middle ground\nbetween laboratory experiments (where the\nenvironment is very unrealistic but controlled)\nand field experiments (where the environment\nis realistic, but it\u2019s very hard to discern cause\nand effect given confounding variables and\nthe lack of control). All of these experiments\nare important to determine how stressors affect ecosystems. Silwood Park is one part of\nthe Ring of Fire Project that integrates information about the impacts of different stressors\nto ecosystems from research on natural systems, mesocosms around the world, and\nmicrobial experiments in the lab. Research on these mesocosms has already revealed\necosystem responses to drought and warming, and will continue to reveal key ecosystem changes in response to multiple stressors.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nScience Spotlight\nSilwood Mesocosms and Freshwater Ecosystems\nwith Professor Guy Woodward\nCara Burke Science Editor\nThis week in Science...\nSevere COVID-19 can make patients breathless for months.\nScientists might finally have an answer as to why\nResearchers develop faster, cheaper way of diagnosing\nprostate cancer\nHello up there!

    "content": "Greetings and salutations to everyone for this\nweek\u2019s column, in today\u2019s piece we will be taking a\nlook at Roti King, an uber popular Chinese Malaysian\nrestauranttuckedawayinbetweenthestationsofKings\nCross and Euston. The restaurant is 30 minutes away\nfrom Imperial College via the District and Victoria\nLine and definitely worth the visit if you have a few\nhours to spare in the afternoon or evenings. However!\n- be aware of the super long lines for this place. Prior\nto me visiting the place, I was warned by my Malaysian\nfriend but I did not understand how bad it was till I\nwent there myself, so be prepared to potentially wait\nfor 20 - 30 min before being served. To avoid this\nmonstrosity of a line, I decided to come 20 minutes\nbefore the restaurant opened at 12pm, and I would\nsuggest you to do the same.\nOnce we were seated, we decided to order 3 things\nfrom the menu: Roti Canai (Chicken), Nasi Goreng\nand Mee Goreng. We felt like this was a good selection\nof rice and noodle dishes and of course we can\u2019t just go\nto Roti King and not get any Roti so we did just that.\nTo quickly start off, for those of you reading who do\nnot know what Roti is, it\u2019s a flatbread dish originating\nfrom India, but is now widely eaten in other parts\nof Southeast Asia. This naturally leads us to our first\ndish, the Chicken Roti Canai (\u00a37.75). The dish comes\nwith two pieces of roti served with a bowl of Chicken\nCurry which we found to be fragrant, creamy and\nlight, considering it is a curry and is perfect for sharing\nbetween two people. You can see the Roti being freshly\nmade so no need to mention how fresh it is, all there is\nto add is that the Roti was perfectly cooked being light\nand was easy to pull apart, with the roti holding onto\nthe curry nicely once it was dipped. Given the price\npoint and the freshness and authenticity of this dish,\nthe Roti Canai is a must get!\nAfter finishing our Chicken Roti Canai, we swiftly\nmoved onto the next dish, Nasi Goreng (\u00a38.50).\nNasi Goreng is an Indonesian/Malaysian fried rice\ndish, traditionally served with a fried egg. It includes\ningredients such as chicken, prawns and beansprouts,\ngarnished with finely cut spring onions and red chillies\nto add a pop of colour and heat. Roti King serves\ndifferent types of Nasi Goreng, with the option to\nchoose from either seafood or chicken. Although it\nmaynotseemlikealotisincluded,theNasiGorengwas\nlight,flavourfulandfragrantwiththeprawnsproviding\na nice texture and taste. Coated with different sauces\nsuch as kecap manis - a sweet soy sauce, it harmonised\nnicelywiththericeandingredients makingitapleasure\nto eat. Furthermore, for those who like a bit more of a\nkick, a side of chilli paste is provided. It should also be\nmentioned that Roti King also serves vegetarian and\nvegan substitutes.\nOur final dish was the Chicken Mee Goreng\n(\u00a38.50), which is a simple yet delicious stir fry egg\nnoodle dish with chicken, beansprouts, red chillies,\ngreen onions and served with a slice of lemon for a nice\ntangy and zesty flavour. Like the Nasi Goreng, the Mee\nGoreng didn\u2019t include many ingredients but it was the\nsauces which elevated the dish. The tangy flavour from\nthe lemon slice, combined with the soft and tender\nchicken, coated with a generous amount of sauce and a\nslight kick from the chillies was an overall pleasure to\neat. For those who want to explore other options, the\nMee Goreng comes with the option to include prawns\nand tofu.\nOverall, I understand the hype surrounding Roti\nKing, the dishes were simple in essence, delicious and\nquite affordable. Although it should be added that\nthe restaurant itself is pretty small, hence why there is\nalways a long queue even 20 minutes before the store\nopens (12pm). If you come at peak lunch or dinner\nhours, there is a possibility of sharing a table with\nsomeone, although I believe this isn\u2019t an issue as a\nbarrier is placed in between. With all that being said,\nthe service here was very fast and the staff work very\nhard to make sure you are handled with care and that\nyour food comes promptly on time. Just a heads up -because of how busy it is, once you make an order you\ncannot add to it afterwards.\nFRIDAY 11TH MARCH 2022\n23\nFood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nRoti King - Rise and shine and get\ninto line\nRestaurant Review\nPricerange: \u00a3\nSignaturedishes: RotiCanai\nStyle: Casual\nEdited by: Bencan Yalcin\nFood\nReviewed by Bencan Yalcin Food Editor\nRoti Chicken Canai\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nNasi Goreng\nPhoto credits: Melis Efecan\nPhoto credits: Melis Efecan\nChicken Mee Goreng\nWRITE FOR FOOD!\nIf the article above has got you\ninterested in writing about\ndelcious resturants or you simply\nwant to share your own food\nrecepies, please email us at:\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I hate to say it, but the algorithm was successful\nyet again, and I found the adventure-action film wildly\nentertaining.\nAs in any blockbuster action film, the main cast\nis filled with familiar faces: Mark Wahlberg [Ted]\nand Tom Holland [Spiderman] play the main duo\n(Victor Sullivan and Nate Drake), with costars Sophia\nTaylor Ali [Grey\u2019s Anatomy], Tati Gabrielle [You],\nand Antonio Banderas.

Unfortunately, Ali and\nGabrielle\u2019s roles are a little lacking in depth and\nfulfilment, but as action films go, Uncharted does\nalright on the female representation front.\nEven though the plot moves slowly at times,\nthe scattered action scenes more than make up\nfor it, comprising multitudes of impressive, well-choreographedstuntsandrooftopchases,intheleagues\nof Mission Impossible. Holland himself has claimed\ntheywerethe\u2018biggestandtoughestofhiscareer\u2019,which\nis saying something coming from the most recent\nspiderman to grace our screens. He spends a lot of time\nbehind bar counters, starting off with neat bartender\ntricks and progressing into a full-on bar fight involving\na bottle of gin, fire-blowing, and some acrobatics. The\ntrailer gives you a glimpse into one of the key action\nsequences, in which Holland clings to a trail of cargo\nbeing whipped around in mid-air, somehow managing\nto fend off bad guys in the process.\nThe visual effects were stunning, with pristine\nisland vistas, a glamourous charity function, and the\naforementioned bar fight occurring in a psychedelic\nunderground club full of coloured lights.

Combined, the IPCC\nprovides an interdisciplinary purview\nfor anthropogenic impacts. In 2021,\nthe release of AR6\u2014the 6th edition\nof a meta-study on climate science\u2014\nproduced shocking figures on the sheer\nmagnitude in which climatological\nvariationsareoccurringandtherisksthey\npose to humanity. The latter is the theme\nof the latest publication titled: \u201cImpacts,\nAdaptation, and Vulnerability\u201d\u2014\neponymous for the working group that\nproduced it (WGII).\nClimate adaptation is one of the two\nbroad research foci in the environmental\nspace, the other being climate\nmitigation. Climate mitigation is the\nsubject of most discussions: How do we\nreduce our impact? What can we do to\nchange our lifestyle to prevent harm in\nthe future? It is an integral step towards\na sustainable society and everyone\u2019s eyes\nare focused on it. Climate adaptation,\non the other hand, is very much like\nthe neglected sibling\u2014a segment that\ngarners fewer academic publications,\nfunding, media-coverage, and awareness\nfrom the masses. Essentially, climate\nadaptation answers how we can deal\nwith the risks posed by climate change\nand provide us with solutions on what\nto do about climate risks that are already\non the way. This typically comes in the\nform of infrastructural development\nand safeguarding sectors to sufficiently\nd e f e n d\ncommunities\nfrom the\nnext natural\ncalamity.\nI t \u2019 s\nimportant to\nun d er s c o r e\ns o m e t h i n g\nhere\u2014these\nc h a n g e s\nare already\nhapp en ing .\nThis is no\nlonger some dystopian future for us to\nwatch on the big screen. We are living\nin a world with disproportionately\nhigher climate risks for workers in\nagriculture, especially for those who\nlive in equatorial countries\u2014the least\nfinancially prepared for such changes\n(this is the basis for climate injustice,\nwhich is a whole article on its own).\nThe impacts faced are only going to get\nworse, and are going to homogenize to\nthe rest of the world within the next\nfew decades. To understand more about\nclimate adaptation and the IPCC\u2019s latest\nreport, we sat down with Prof. Richard\nBetts, lead author for the chapter on\nwater, and a co-author for others. Along\nwithhisglobalcontributions,Prof.Betts\nis a leader in the UK\u2019s climate fora\u2014he\nis the head of UK\u2019s most recent Climate\nChange Risk Assessment, which is in\nconjunction with the MET office. Out\nof the conversation with him, we gained\na deeper understanding of the issue at\nhand.\nForProf.Betts,thekeymessageofthis\nreport is that \u201cThere is a vast amount\nof evidence for anthropogenic climate\nchange. The IPCC can now affirm with\neven more certainty than before that\nwe are the cause for sharper changes\nin temperature in the last year\u2014a very\nstraight line being drawn from our fossil\nfuel consumption. This has resulted in\nhumanity being in a position of great\nrisk which requires tremendous changes\nin our way of living.\u201d\nWithin this global climate narrative,\nclimate adaptation becomes a greater\nimperative than ever before. Specifically,\n\u201cfor temperature targets such as 1.5o\nC\nby 2050. We now know\u2014with even\nmore accuracy\u2014what a 1.5o\nC world\nis going to look like. It\u2019s already filled\nwith higher extreme weather events as\ncompared to before. The good news\nis that we can adapt for quite a lot of\nit\u2014there are some success stories of\nadapting to climate and there will be\neven more with better financing. A lot\nof adaptation is often derived through\ntacit skills\u2014socio-cultural norms in the\nagriculture industry especially\u2014who\nhaveproventobequiteresilientattimes.\nWhile climate adaptation is a good\nshield, it still has to be mixed with very\nPranjal Mathur Environment Writer\nTHIS IS NO\nLONGER SOME\nDYSTOPIAN\nFUTURE FOR US\nTO WATCH ON THE\nBIG SCREEN\n\u201c\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n12\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nMonika Yordanova\nEnvironment View online here!\nCredit: Roxanne Desgagnes, Unsplash\n\n"
