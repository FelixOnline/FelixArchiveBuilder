    "content": "FELIX\nME& MY GHOUL Perhaps it was the date, or the\napproach of Spring, or something.\nLast Friday the IJ th of March was the\nMines Carnival - the big effort of Alan Lewis, the Mines Entertainments\nOfficer. Dogged by that date, and the\nfact that everyone else was doing something else, the cabaret was given its first rehearsal on the night of March\nthe 13th hardly auspicious. However, the high spot of the offering that\nwas presented was a rather neat and\ntopical song all about a book published\nby the B.M. A. including 3Uch admonitions as \"The Bride-to-be, Should read\nPage 3n \u00ab Otherwise, it was easy to\nspot the good intentions behind the sketches, if not the polished performance.\nMr. Lewis certainly earns his position,\nfor he appeared in several guises\nthroughout the proceedings.\nThe flats were ingenious and suit ably ghoulish - but not half so ghoulish as some of the costumes that appear-ed; I.C. appears to have some avid\nreaders of horror comics.\nThe food was available, and by ^\nthat I mean that it was possible to get\nat it and everybody seemed satisfied, certainly it was welcome.\nOne feature that was a marked\nimprovement on previous carnivals was\nthe band - this was outstanding and the\ndancing was all the more enjoyable.\nIt was perhaps unfortunate that\nseveral of the more vociferous of the\nCollege's interrupt ers were present,\nsome very loud - and, admittedly, pertinent comments were to be heard.\nTO;.; KING ADD NOEL KKAEw III\nCABAH7A'\nRCS. UNION MEETING The R.C.S. new jour a a; j; ii on heard of plans\nfor a new journal at the Union Meeting\nheld last wee';. It will reo lac s the\nold Scientific Journal which had \"been\nin decline for the last few years.\nThe new journal will deal with accounts of res 3-arch a one in R.C. S.wr i tten in a popular vs in i rail ar to the\nNew Scientist. It will as lo contain\nUnion news. The journal will be\nedited by MicH;.el Banks who said that\nthere will be no question of copying\nor competing with Phoenix.\nAfter this serious business the\nUnion settled down to a more lighthearted motion that 'The R.C.S. Union ain't, wot it used t 'be'. Prof. Hewer, pre-'\nposing the motion, told of the good old day r of P.G. \u00b0. in the early 2^s. R.C.S. did net have any trophies or\nresidents clad in gay raiment. Having no trophies was an advantage, the\ntrophies make a college much more\nvulnerable.\nIn 1920 and'2-l R.C.S. joined with\nthe lesser colleges of I.C. to give\njig ht to the United Hospitals at a push ball match limited to 300 a side,\none set of goal rost s being the\nMarble Arch, the other Hyde Park.\nThe punctured ball adorned the union,\nas did the helmet of the gentleman who\npunctured the ball with a jacknife.\nIn those days R.C.S. wen the\nHorphy; Mines having sunk and Guilds\nwere level with the water.\nMike Amos opposing the motion enumerated the sport and social successes\nof the last few years; R.C.S. have won\nthe Technology cur for the last5 years,\nwon the Lowry this year for the first time in living memory have done well in the Rector's Cup- they were only 3\n-)Oints behind the winners. On the\nsocial side, R.C.S. is the only constituent college to produce s cng and\ndance teams from its college. Also\nJezebel, with her jue en, is reliable beyond doubt.\nDr. Dr-lz i el speaking of P.C.S. in the Jjfts told the union of one of\nits presidents who actually saved,\nmoney from his grant and moved a motion\nfrom the chair that students should save\nmoney from their grants av,\nd send .\n, t back\nto the authorities.\nJohn Dewey said that the proposition had based their arguments on old\norgies. The Kangella is now a cha-cha and last Christmas we lost an\neminent entomologist who used to s it on china objects in the snack bar.\nMr. ^or ster, dressed in a tail coat, swimming trunks and a lavatory\nbrush was e mbar assed by the subtleties\nof the previous speakers.

    "content": "FEUX\nPHOTOGRAPHIC EXHIBITION Tola year's Fhotographio Society\nExhibition showed in general a considerably higher standard of photography\nthan last year's. In part this was\npresumably due to a slightly different\nhanging policy, whereby a strictly\nselected set of prints and slides were\nput on show. Since this is an exhibition whose lowest standard reflects on\nthe club as surely as its highest this\nis obviously a good idea. Perhaps a better, if a smaller exhibition could bt\nproduced by carrying this treatment a stage further. The exhibition is still dominated by the work of a handful of members. In some few oases\nthese members themselves are not, I think, really selective in what they\nchoose to submit. Their prints accordingly swamp the show, and oe rta in names\noccur on stand after stand. If the\ncommittee really wants these marathon\nentries could they not raise another\nGlaister-type trophy and present this\nfor the best panel of prints irrespective of subject matter. In this\nway. the work of the big producers could\nbe kept together. Incidentally Dr.\nGlaister again provided one of the highlights of the exhibition with just such\na one man panel.\nI thought the Technical and Record\nsection presented some ridiculous\ncontrasts as well as some of the most\ninteresting prints. Surety a picture\nof a flood-lit chateau and another of\nthe drive gears of a printing u ess\nsimply do not belong in the same section.\nTo place them together seems non sens i cal, and must make the job of judging\nthe section unnecessarily difficult.\nThis College at any rate should find\nno difficulty in fielding a full Technical section over and above the nebulous Record photos.\nDivorced from their sections and\ntheir authors the prints shown were of\na very high standard. It was a pleas-arid change to see mounting and titling\nhelping rather than spoiling good\nphotographs. Mr. Ginger's task of\nselecting the p rise winning prints\nmust have been difficult, and, inevitably, not everyone will have agreed\nwith his judgement. Prominent amongst\nSEN OBAS}1 the p rise winners Mr. Eyoott emerges\nas a prolific, proficient, and, one\nmight almost add, a professional photo-graph er. His portraiture entry seemed\nto me as good a thing as we have seen.\nI had a conviction that there were far\ntoo many, but would not like to have to\nleave out. Mr. Peacock impressed\nwith his sure eye for a picture.\nMany exhibition prints seem to result\nfrom lucky shots and it is a pleasure\nto see care and planning even before\nthe exposure is made. There are many\nothers worthy of individual mention,\nbut space ha rly permits an exhaustive\nsurvey.\nThe transparency sections were again popular. It is a pity there is not\na better way of displaying small trans-p are nci es. The public projection/\nsession did little just ioe to any of\nthe darker slides; it is unfortunate\nthat this side of the exhibition was not\nhandled as professionally as the rest.\nMany of the slides seemed to lack the\nmechanical finish which would be\nnecessary in an exhibition print.\nThis is surprising as some of the un-mounted specimen ts were well worth\nlooking after. The colour section was\nremarkably restrained, and there were\nsome be auf if ul studies which were virtually monochrome. At the other end\nof the scale were flower and leaf\nstudies using the full colour range of\nthe film involved. There were no\ncolour prints sham, emphasising the\nneed for a good cheap and reliable amateur colour printing system. Perhaps\nthe Agfaoolour system will have put this\nright by next year.\n(Vice-President's Footnote: The hanging policy followed this year was\nexactly as in previous years, the first\nconsideration being that every entrant\nmust be represented somewhere, even\nthough that person may only enter one\nprint, and that a rather poor one.\nTTfth this *rt*a to the fore we then rejected some twenty prints. There were\nvarious reasons far this - dupl i cat ive., bad mounting, bad printing, or just a bad photograph. We had to be far mors\nruthless with the colour transparencies,\nand rejected over half, the main reasons being bed colour balance, or bad\nphotography.\nFrom this exhibition six prints have\nbeen chosen to represent the College in\nthe Fifth European Inter-University Photographic Exhibition being held in\nBristol this Year. I.M.P.) BOOKS TO SOUTH AFRICA\nIsaac is a coloured South African.\nHe wants to be educated. He is not a member of the Dutch Reformed Church which\nsupports apartheid and therefore cannot\nuse any library supported by the state.\nHis family earn about \u00a35 - \u00a36 per month\nBooks are very expensive and beyond his\nreach.\nThe University of London Union are\ncollecting books for South Africa.\nThey will be orated and sent to the\nTrevor Huddleston Mission. If you have\nany books, especially old school books,\nplease bring then with you next term.\nThere will be a stall for collecting\nthese books at I.C. and there is one\nalready at U.L. U. Smoking Concert The firs* record of this activity\nis in the Union minutes for i898, when,\nit is recorded, the Professors attended\nafter dinner, in evening dress, and\nmany of the acts were done by the le cr tur ers. The Smoking Concert has changed\nsomewhat from those early, sedate days\nbut last Friday's Concert, in some\nrespects, came nearer to the spirit or\nthe original than some others in recent\nyears. A varied show was very competently\nproduced by Michael Amos, and although\nthe traditional free beer was available,\nand consumed, at the back of the Concert\nHall, the audience obviously enjoyed\nwhat was going en on the stage without\nbeing moved to participate physically.\nThe highlight of the evening was a fashion show, organised and comp ered by\nPeter Morgan, in wh i oh he showed fa shi cms, constructed from academic gowns and\npurple and white paper, and modelled by\nmembers of ICWA. Also noteworthy were\ntwo sketches put. on by geologists, one\nof which was a skit an a silent film,\nin wh i oh the audience was invited to boo\nthe villain and cheer the hero (and did\nthe reverse) while a bearded pianist\nplayed ecclesiastical ly. The other was\na rather gruesome silhouette \"operation1' in wh i oh the shadow doctor was seen to\nextract strings of intestine-like\nobjects from the pati ets interior eventually reaching the root of the trouble\na Mooney chip. Physicists demonstrated\ntwo rook 'n roll parodies, which were\nalmost cruelly close to the real thing,\nand the mathematicians produced an epic\nof Prehistoric Britain. Maloolm Green\ncomp ered the whole show with much\nviva o it y These shows, as was pointed out of\nthe Guilds Carnival cabaret, only meant\nto be seen once and then forgotten, but\nwhile they last, they are extremely enjoyable to spectators and actors alike.\nIt is eR COur aging to see, both from the\naudience's reaction and from the participation of members of ICWA, that it is\npossible to put on a good entertaiment\nat I.C. without descending into unnecessary bawdiness.\nTONY NEWSTEAD LEADING THE JAZZ BAND\nIN THE QUAD.\n\n"

    "content": "mix4 NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT\nDear Sir, It n ank you for your attention bo\n.u y letter printed in the last edition\nof Felix. In reply to your comments\nI would make the following points:\na) The S. C.C.s its as infrequently as\nit conveniently can: last term it sat\ntwice and so far this term it has sat\nonce.\nb) The Nuclear Disarmament Commi tte e did not apply for membership\nof S. C.C. because preliminary pro b Lem3 made it obvious that it would\nbe rejected immediately. Thi3 was\nstated by several Union and S. C.C. off io^ als when such an application\nwas contemplated. Not only did they made it obvious in their words\nbut also in their actions, as you\nyourself must remember.\nAs you seem to suggest that all the Nuclear Disarmament Committee has\nto do to be accepted by S. C.C. is to apply , this is axa otl y what is to be done. However, it has been decided to broaden the scope of such ascii e ty to include every aspect of the\nstruggle for World Peace and the Socw ill therefore have the title of\n'Peace Union.' In this way we hope\nto embrace all shades of opinion in I.C. on the subject of World peace\nand co-operation.\nThe constitution will be on the\nUnion board by 9th March and the\nsignatures will follow immediately.\nThe rest will be up to the S. C.C. and\nUnion Executive.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Finney.\nCOMMENT\nDear Sir,I feel I cannot let David Finney's letter to go without comment. Is there\na genuine need for a Peace Union in this\nCollege? We have a long-established\nInternational Relations Club which sure-ly is the body for discussion of problems which surround the aspects of \"the\nstruggle for World Peace.\"\nThe wording of the letter and the\nuse of phrases such as Struggle for\nWorld Peace, Peace Union, World Peace\nand Co-operation strongly suggest a Communist inspired organisation. That\nevery member of the Union is entitled to\nhra own views is undeniable and if there\nare \u00abnou gn people with similar interests\nor views they should be allowed to form\na society. However there is a Marxist\nsub-group of the Lit and Deb Society.\nIf the proposed Peace Union is Communist\nthen that is its place.\nAny movement fighting for world\npeace if it is to have a moral force\nmust either contain all shades of political opinion or be a political, that\nis to say argue from a humanistic\npoint of view. The United Nations\nStudents Association, containing all shades of opinion, is such a body on\na national so ale. U.N.3.A. not only\ntalks about world problems but it takes part in practical solutions of some. It participates in work camps\nwhere volunteers help to build houses\nfor refugees, the products of war and\nworld unrest. U. NV3.A. endeavours to\nunderstand and help others to understand the U.N.,a body dedicated to\npeace which however is only as strong\nas its members allow it to be. The\nInternational Relations Club is affiliated to U.N.3.A. and therefore it seems proper that any discussion suo h as David Finney envisages should be\nwithin the International Relations Club.\nYours sincerely,\nP. PORGESS.\nDR.ZHIVAGO.\nBoris Pasternak's book l* Dr Zhivago\", is not a good hovel when' compared with those\nbf Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky: this said\nM.G. Kullman M.A. from the Royal College\nof Art, is shown by the lack of continuous\nplot, the strange coincidences which are\nnot a consequence of events, and the\nunexplained appearance and disappearance\nof people other than Zhivago himself.\nGENERAL STUDIES\nHerein lies the reason for this book\nbeing condemned as counter-revolutionary\n- it ie contrary to political su priority. It is not a ot iv ely opposed to the re vol u tion; it does not need to be, as to have\ndoubts is worse than being in opposition,\nand being outside the normal values on\nw hio hit may be judged, it must therefore\nbe wrong.\nHowever, overlooking this point, the\nbook pre-supposes some previous knowledge of the Russian Revolution (as compared with \"War. and -Peace\", in w hio hall required history is given), and against\nthis it makes sense, it does not give\nthe*overall pio ture, but rather the obverse human story of one man's suffering\nand the cost of the revolution, hence ao hao tic form of writing has been used to\ndescribe an unstable social structure in\nao hao tio situation - a good reason for\nthe many omissions.\nZhivago is not a good hero; he is\nnot an a ot ive agent for the good or bad,\nand his life is epi tomis ed by passivity.\nHe stands for values wh i oh are ignored\nby the revolution - ordinary values of\nlove and poetry on the one hand, and of\nkeeping his family alive on the other -values wh i oh are both above and below\nthose of the revolution itself. He is accused of being a coward, for running\naway to write poetry, be o a use he did no\nagree that all should be s a or if io#4 tot\nthe revolution.\nIt is very probable that \"Dr Zhivago\" is close to an autobiography; the\nimage of rotting and wasted crops makes\nZhivago doubt the value of the revolution\nand in 1928 be dies be o a use he has survived in t caso oie ty wh i oh has no room for\nhim, of a disease for wh i oh no-one has\nany time either - oe rta in ly no hero of\npacifism. Although Pasternak is stills live it may be that part of him that\ndied with Zhivago in1928. This adds positive value-to the work, in the suggestion of the meaning of life and immortal it y: there are things which we do wh i oh are immortal, by wh i oh we remain in the\nworld through the effects of what we\nhave done, where a\" the body which did\nthem is mortal. And further, there is\nthe possibility of living in the future\nsuggested at the end of the book:-\"To the two aging friends sitting\nby the window it seemed that this freedom\nof the spirit was there, that on that ve\nvery evening the future had become almost\ntangible in the streets below, and that\nthey had themselves -entered that future\nand would, from now on, be part of it.\" MR. ICWA.\nMoral integrity, sense of humour,\nair of mystery, -virtue, and virility; these are the requirements of Mr.\nI. C.W. A. Or so the young ladies were\nInformed w nen they met on March 5th to\nelect their -pm-up boy of 1959\".\nTwenty-six members assembled in\nthe lounge and as each nominee was introduced his superior,qualities, were\noutlined in a short speech by his\nproposer. In all eight gentlemen\nwere present and it was painfully evident that there was a majority from the\nR.S. M. and, in particular, the mining\ngeology department. In fao t, the Pres\nident, Miss Til dan-Smith announced her\nconclusion that the Mines must indeed\nbe a \"hot-bed of iniquity\".\nThe Victims varied from Brian\nYoung, \"the man with s a voir f aire\", and\nexo ellen t ly proposed by John Coles, to\nGeorge Manson who wore his kilt for\nthe occasion and sought leave from the\nPresident to remain standing throughout.\nThe comic a ot was provided by Trevor\nSoarrat who presented Miss TildenSmith with a brush of doubtful use, a Jnion Jack, and a4 week old pie baked\nby himself. However, this subtle\nbribery was in vain for Tony Ewart, aP.G. Mining Geologist, was finally\nelected Mr. I. C.W. A. Tony, or Tub, as he is affectionately known by the fair sex, was proposed by Cleopatra; introducing him thus:\n\"we are not looking for at all, dark,\nhandsome Romeo, but someone who has\ngiven his ser vio es to I. C.W. A. \u2022 someone\nwho is shy and modest\". They could\nnot have chosen better for it is his own\nmodesty which has caused him to heavily\ncensor this account of the proceedings.\nHowever, apart from the favourable\npub lio it y which will be so helpful in\nhis o are er, the rewards of this post are\nmany. They include feeding the goldfish at weekends, and being present on\nthe I. C.W. A. photographs and on their\ntheatre visits. In addition, our\n'beau' was presented with a sash of\nhonour (significantly made 6 inches too\nshort) and a \"constant companion\" -a black pointed tailor's model. His\ncomment on receiving the latter was\n\"just what I have always wanted\". How\ntrue!!!\nFinally, I hope that Tony's year\nof office is a happy one. . It should be\nfar there is plenty of latent talent -in fao t it's all latent! And now that\nhe has been elected, what of the future?\nI implore you ladies. Make the most of\nhim.\nNelson.\n\n"

His speech\nturned mainly on the idea that the mater-i al satisfactions which could be experienced on Earth were quite adequate,\nwithout Slaving to depart to other planets\nin order to find new ones. He supported this view by exhibiting brightly\ncoloured brochures advertising a cert in holiday camp, which, he alleged,-'\nwas one place where these satisfactions\nmight be obtained. He was opposed by\nMr. L.J. Carter, the Secretary of the\nBritish Interplanetary Society, who,\nwith obvious sincerity, described the\nnew vistas which would be opened to\nKan by the conquest of Space, the\nopportunites for scientific discovery, and the solution of Earth's population problems.

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLE GF UNION No 132 FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27 , 1959 4dIC DEBATING SUCCESS THE O LO^S DEFEATED The Imperial College debating\nteam came away from the final3 of the U.L. U. debating contest on\nMonday, March 9th at the Beveridge Hall as holders of the Debating Challenge\nCup for the first time ever.\n15 minutes before the debate started the Captain of the Imperial team won\nthe toss and decided that Imperial\nshould propose. Then the sealed envelope containing a motion decided upon by\nthe President and Secretary of U.L. U. debates was opened and the motion read\nout by the captain of the team from\nRichmond College, the other finalists. The motion was: \"That Commercial\nenterprises are a greater danger to the\nliberty of the individual than polit ical parties*\"\nlies Allen opened the debate for I.C., outlining the I.C. case, and\nmentioning the various ways in which\ncommercial enterprise limited individual freedom. John Loome who seconded for I.C. attacked modern methods\nof advertising and some other dubious\naspects of modern commerce.\nThe first Richmond speaker dwelt\nat great length on the weaknesses of a two party system. The second Richmond\nspeaker made several good points but\nwas not very tidy in his presentation.\nThird speakers on both sides were\nwhimsical. Peter Jarman for I.C. was\nwitty in a manner relevant to the mot-ion, but the Richmond speaker, undoubtedly an excellent comedian in the Al Read vein,was largely off the point.\nBo. .x nch speaking 4th for I.C. made out that it was almost a contradiction in terms to speak of a political party limiting freedom. His\nopposite number from Richmond produced a magnificent piece of oratory\nmarred only by the occasional outstanding illogical it y. John Loome's summing up for I.C. was unquestionably stronger than the\nRichmond effort.\nThe verdict was decided by a panel of 3 independant judges.\nLes Allen had to leave the debate\nbefore the end to be back in time to\nplay the lead in the Taming of the\nShrew.\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 3.\nJOHN BRUGES SCORING THE ONLY I.C. TRY.\nJO LOSES RUGBY FINAL TO KINGS At Motspur Park last Saturday I.C, relinquished their grasp on the U.L. Rugger Cup with a rather disappointing\ndisplay of Cup Rugby. Right from the\nbeginning of the game when I.C. seemed\nunable to do anything right, it looked\nas though Kings were a better team.\nAfter 10 minutes of ragged play during\nwhich I.C. had plenty of ball, a pena l ty from a line out infringement on\nour 25 gave Kings a3 point lead..\nTwo minutes later Ted Wright, open side wing forward, was helped off the field with what turned out to be^a dislocated\nshoulder.\nPlay now swung more frequently into I.C.'s25, although the\nI.C. scrum still got their3 hare of the\nball. Two missed penalties from within\nthe I.C.25 should have heralded the\nI.C. retaliation but it was not to be.\nLater I.C. in turn missed two penalties\nand although they got a fair share of\nthe ball, inconclusive play allowed the\ngame to range from one end ^o 'the other.\nIn the second na if Kings kicked off\nwith the wind and while play was still in our 25, Jones in the Kings centre\ndropped a goal from in front of the\nposts making the so ore60. When play\nagain returned to our line, an attempt\nat a pushover try resulted in a loose\nball a foot from the line and a Kings\nforward scooped it over for three more\npoints the conversion bringing the\nKings lead to 11-0. Having nothing\nto lose I.C. began to try to open the\ngame up and far the last 15 minutes\nplayed their best rugby of the game,\nkeeping Kings in their own 25. A out\nbao k into the scrum by Flyhalf Hearn\nwith the subsequent pass to Bregazsi\nand to Bridges resulted in the latter scoring. The conversion hit the post\nleaving the score at 11-3 where it remained to the end of the game in spite\nof I.C. pressure.\nOf the game as a whole, I.C. got off\nto a very bad start and only recovered\nin the last20 minutes. Kings were a very good team and proved very fast in the forwards although the I.C. scrum were\nstill on equal terms at the end. Ted\nWright's injury left Kings with a spare\nman to bottle up the I.C. outsides,\nwhose movement was already handicapped\nby a certain lack of understanding at\nhalfback and it is difficult to say\nwhat the result would have been had he\nnot had to leave the field. The flow of the game was spoilt completely by long and apparently\nunnecessary periods of injury time on\nbehalf of the King3 backs. I.C., with\nthe exception of wings Milward and Buet,\ndid not show their be*t, although the\nforwards fought to t \u00ab bitter end. The\nsupporters- who came to cheer must have\nbeen as disappointed as the team but\nwe o an only thank them and say that we\nwill do better next year.\nThree more games remain to be\nplayed this season, against Penzance,\nFalmouth and .St. Ives on 23rd,24 th and 25th March in Cornwall, and we hope\nthat any I.C. men in the neighbourhood\nwill come along and watch.\n\n"

    "content": "FEU X3 THE TAMING OF THE SHREW Compared with the majority of\nShakespeare's plays, \"The Shrew\" leaves\nmuch to he desired: the dialogue shows\na 'prentice grasp of poetry, although\nPetruohio's \"mother-wit\" on first meeting with Katherina gives a glimpse of Shakespeare's control of words, the plot\nis a pato h work of stories with many\nloose ends - characters meet in the\nstreet, having come from distant lands,\nand happen to know each other1s fathers:\nPetruchio has a half-hour's courtship\nand disappears until the wedding day\nwithout explanation: and Bianca's wo ers do not seem concerned in attracting her love.\nThe main plot gives rise to much\nshouting and abuse from Petruchio to\neveryone he meets, but he is very care-ful not to say anything to his wife\nthat, more than any deed, may cause her\npermanent hurt: he tames her with\nincredible severity by depriving her\nof luxuries, and by tinting all his remarks with cutting irony. As to the\nobject of his ravings, under the stubborn and rebellious mask of a biting tongue, Katherina can be seen to be\nmarriageable, and at the end (for a modern audience) embarrassingly faithful to her husband: on several occasions she shows herself willing to sub mi to his stupid wt ii ms, such as his assertion that the sun was the moon.\nThe character of Bianca is more\ndifficult to analyse, for she does not\nact as the sweet and innocent young _\nwoman that Hortensio would have us believe: her deceit of him in preference\nfor the unknown Lucentic, in the guise\nof a tutor, is shameful by any standards,\nand remains unexplained and unconvincing\nin the plot. Not that Bianca is an\nimportant part: but she is the focus\nof all the sub-plots except the Induction, and should therefore be strong\nenough to hold them together.\nHowever, leaving aside all the\ntechnicalities, there is enough comedy and plausibility in the story to be good entertainment. So it was with\nlast week's production by the I.C. Dramatic Society. The leads were\nplayed with considerable ii ol ish and\ngusto, sufficient to Overcome the\nweaknesses of the plot and of the other\nactors.\nLeslie Allen gave an excellent\nperformance as Petruchio: he raved\nat tii e servants, treated his wife as\nno wife should be treated, yet still made himself liked by the audience.\nJudith Korhbluth, as Katherine, was\nalso very good: her acting was most\nmoving and conveyed the change in character well..\nGrumio, servant to Petruchio,\nwas played by Peter Korgan he has\n3how na great improvement in the\nlast few productions, and this was his\nbest yet - he really made us feel\ncold whoa he entered Petruchio's house\nshivering.\nA quick resume' of se me of the\nothers: Terry Wright as Baptists\nMinola (Katherina's father] was well cast: Ken Packer gave a very fair interpretation of Gremio (suitor\nto Bianca), but was lacking in variety\nand a little difficult to hear: Dick\nWright, as Hortensio, improved as\nit ie play proceeded, but just failed to\nEES ALLEN JUDITH KORNBLUTH\nconvince: Desmond Turner (Lucentio)\nwas just sufficiently appealing to\nmake himself undisputed suitor to\nBianca: and Tris Dickinson, as Bianca\n' was unfortunate in h::. vi.i^; a rather in decisive part to play.\nBut, as an example that a small\npart can be portrayed :\n-.\nswell as. i main\none, Victor Soyoe as the tailor la. veil\nworth mention i:'. \u2122: he was on stage for\nonly a few minutes, and said only a, few words, but he gave the part a reality which was missing in sane of the\nothers.\nThe scenery for this production was\nquite reasonable, but was poorly lit: it had no feeling of depth, the lig h ting with very few filters was too harsh,\nand on too many occasions were actors\ntalking in the dark, Why was more use\nnot made of the footlights?\nFinally, it is not good for cont inuit y to have long pauses with an\nempty stage, even on the first night:\nbut, taken as a whole, \"The Shrew\"\nprovided an enjoyable evening, with\nthanks to the producer Colin Dixon.\nP.J.C. CONTINUED FROM PACE 1\nThe Imperial team are pleased\nabout the victory for several reasons.\nFirstly, Richmond are a college of\ntheologians, who might be said to be\nprofessional speakers, and they have\nwon the contest for the last three\nyears. Secondly, it shows that\nImperial is not necessarily a college\nof over specialised scientific morons,\ncapable of winning nothing except on a sports field. Thirdly, the road to\nthe finals was not easy: I.C. had to\nmeet Guy's, where there was a very\ngood team, L.S. S., where one would expect to find good speakers, and Birk beck who last year won the national\ncontest.\nQJUo-pat tui Meedle\nSpring is the time when a young man's fancy turns to thoughts of\nlove, (though ' tis said it is also the\ntime when a young man's fano y turns to what most of the girls have been thinking of the whole winter). Can this\nbo the reason for the mode of behaviour\nof the men during the last few weeks?\nHave some bright young things caught\ntheir eyes? Or is it the anticipation of the end of term and the\nbeginning of good wholesome ooo king that has brought about this miraculous\nchange? No. These are not sufficient\nreasons, the most satis fao tor one having been discovered only after much investigation into the activities of the\nafflicted ones.\nThe transformation began with the\nun disguising of an t Bawoutlve Member of\none of the Constituent Colleges. After having reo eiv ed no satisfactory explanation for this hasty step, his acquaintances sought to find a solution*\nSlowly it dawned on them, but they ware\nloath to part with their \"knowledge. To\ntell all would be to lose all. A little competition is a good thing but too\nmu o his disarming. These knowledgeable\nfellows Daft off their untidy clothes j and took on an immaculate appearance.'\nBut this was not the only noticeable\nchange; manners showed an improvement\nbeyond imagination. The ladies no\nlonger had the experience of having\na heavy door swung in their faces; in fao t the door was now opened for them\nand closed to behind them. Their '\n*\nlanguage was moderated and no more\nexcuses had to be made in female com-p any. General behaviour towards a, lady was particularly pleasing though\nthis o our tes y was limited to the members of I. C.W. A. Perhaps'it was a form of canvassing by prospective candidates for the title of Mr. I. C.W. A. These tactics were employed with one'\naim in view, namely that of ^procuring\nan invitation to the I. C.W. A. Formal\nDinner and Danoe on the last Friday of term.^ There are but'few lucky ones and\nmany downhearted rejected for esa ken men.\nThe strong competition for invitations\nthis year has lead many of the women\nto wonder whether the Guest Speaker,\nEveljia-Home, is not fact the main\nattraction* .\n7 >r CHOIR CONCERT Last Wednesday the Imperial College\nChoir gave a spirited rendering of\nMozart's Mass inC miner. This work,\nwhich was left incomplete by the composer at his death, has had the missing .\nparts sup-lied from NiOaart's other\nchurch music.\nThe choir, ably supported by the\nharvey Phillips Orchestra, was. conducted\nby Dr. Eric Brown of the Civil Engineering Department. The soloists, from\nthe Opera School, were in general good,\nalthough the first soprano had the unfortunate failing of pitch flutter on\nsustained notes. This fault, which\nproved distressing at times to the aud-ien ce, should not be allowed to detract\nfrom the over al. high standard of the\nproduction. In particular\u2022the Benedictus was worthy of special hot ee As g rousing introduction to the\nprogramme we heard Vaugiian-V/illi ams Be.ii di cite. This work, composed in the 1930s is a fitting tribute to the-memory of this great English composer.\n\n"

LUDLAM.\nSWIMMING Last Monday and Wednesday the\nSwimming Championships were staged\nat the University Pool, Malet Street.\nDuring the o our se of the evening\nnearly every existing record was\nshattered. Battersea, the favourites\nwon the title this year, with I.C., the\nholders, finishing a good 3e cond, just\nin front of Q.M. C. The highlight of\nthe evening was the medley relay race,\nwhere thanks to a magnificent butterfly swim by Shorey, I.C. just beat Battersea and also lowered the record by\nseveral seconds. In the individual\nevents Harford, although finishing second in the back stoke, retained his University title, as the winner was not\na member of the Union. Loveman, the\ndefending breaststroke champion, had\nthe hard luck, to beat the existing\nchampionship record, yet only finished\nthird. Other members who did well\nincluded Wilson who came 4thin the\n440, Hills fifth in the breaststroke,\nand Allcock 6thin the butterfly.\nIn the Water Polo League, the most\nsuccessful team has been the I.C. third team which won the IVth division with\nthe following record:\nP6W6 GF 20 GA 5 P12 This is a very good achievement\nconsidering that\na) it was only started two years ago as\na sport team,\nb)it is the only college third team\nplaying in the League.\nThe two higher teams, although both in respectable positions in their leagues,\ncannot claim any glory.

C.5'10\"11st. \u2014 look small.) With\ntii is 'draw' in mind a comparatively\nsmall team of six players was taken\n( a mistake which nearly cost the\nPlate.), and the first match with\nR. S,P# was regarded as a mere formality\non the Poly's side. But suddenly\nthe I.C. team clicked.

Mike Barron was the star with\nhis 1 st half 12 pts.\nIn the next match we had the\ngreat pleasure of meeting the\n\u2022Texan Giants' to determine whether\nwe went into the 'Plate' ( runners up)\nor the 'Cup' ( winners) Pinal.
