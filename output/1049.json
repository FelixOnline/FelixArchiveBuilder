Still, mustn't grumble:\nit was all a bit of a revelation.\nApart from anything else,\nI had the rather uplifting\nexperience of suddenly discovering that some ol IC\nsecurity staff are really nice,\nhelpful people. Not much of\na job, having to deal with irritating drunk students at\nungodly hours of the morn-ing. Especially that sort\nwho mistake stupidity for\n'having a bit of a laugh'. It\nmust take a remarkable act of\npatience to sit them down\nwith cups of tea and be pater-nal. And I certainly wouldn't show compassion for the\nfuture of their careers by\nrefusing to involve the police\nand dealing with it internally.\nSecurity staff are much\nmocked at IC, not least in the\nFelix office, but I was really\nimpressed with the way they\nhandled things. It must be a fairly thankless task.\nBut I do think it's remarkable that because we\nare students, with the priv-el edge of having a better education than most, we have a license to get away with\nthings that other members of\nthe community would be\ncondemned for. The idea\nseems to be that we are\nmeant to do great things for\nsociety, and we can't possibly\nbe allowed to jeo pardi se that\nby public ising the fact that\nsometimes we're fairly\ndegenerate.\nSelkirk Enough of this being nice to\npeople - lets come out and\nadmit the truth: pettiness and\nthe art of being over-critical is\nstill alive and well and living\nat Imperial. During one of the\nbrief moments I got to spend\nin my hall of residence this\nweek I was regaled with that\nmost encouraging of greet-in gs: \"No one reads Felix\nbecause it's shit.\" On trying\nmy best to find out what they\nthought I should do to\nimprove the student new spa per, I was told it was full of\ninaccuracies. \"Like what?\", I said. \"Well,\" came the reply,\n\"you said that a gigabyte of\nRAM cost \u00a3100, but everyone knows you can get four\ngigabytes for that much.\"\nAaah.\nEDITORIAL TEAM: NEWS: ALEX FEAKES FEATURES: MARK BAKER\nMUSIC: VIK BANS AL CINEMA: WEI LEE\nARTS: JEREMY PHOTOGRAPHY: DIANA HARRISON AND WILLIAM LORENZ THEATRE: KATHERINE FISH WICK PUZZLES: CATFISH SCIENCE: BEN WILKINS ARRESTING& COLLATING LAST WEEK: TIM, BEN, MARK AND ALEX DELIVERIES: MARK "

The World Service produce science programs which are popular in countries all over the world except here. Rebecca Mileham reports.\nI spoke to 15 million people a few\nmonths ago. I'm not sure exactly\nwhich 15 million they were, or\neven what country they were all\nin. What I do know is that I probably\ndidn't know any of them, and that my\nname, was completely, utterly, totally\nunknown to them.\nI was talking to them about science. Here\nthe scenario starts to seem even more unlikely.\nNot only was I talking to people I didn't know\nand who didn't know me, the subject with\nwhich I chose to introduce myself was science.\nAnd I'm afraid it gets worse. Depending on\nwhen they were listening to me talking, they\nmight have heard me saying things about\nAlzheimer's disease, childbirth or a rare congenital disease similar to Parkinson's. At least that\nwas vaguely medical - people are always interested in their health. But one week in August, I attempted to interest people in an esoteric story\nI'd just heard about someone playing music at\n4.5 times the speed of light. Right. And the following week, horror of horrors, all I could come\nup with was something really bizarre about nan-o technology. Unbelievable.\nIt actually was unbelievable, the idea that I, Unknown Rebecca', could be speaking into a World Service microphone, onto a tape, which\nwould be sent off across the planet to places like\nAntigua, the Cayman islands,\nCyprus, Kuwait, South Africa,\nMauritius, Brunei, the United Arab\nEmirates or China. 'Like' these\nplaces? Nowhere could possibly be\nlike them all. Half the point is that\nall these places are totally different,\nand yet local radio stations had chosen to pay money for a radio programme about science. And according to the sales statistics, more stations choose to pay for someone talking about\nscience than money, sport, books or celebrities.\nOf course I could only talk about science.\nMy expertise, such as it is, is in science rather\nthan any other, more cultural or politically topical things like the latest Kundera novel or the\nglobal ramifications of civil war in Eastern\nEurope. Aid in a way, I'm sorry.\nIn England, I mention my job at the\nScience Museum, and\nRebecca Mileham completed an MSc in Science Communication at Imperial last year and did\nher work placement at Radio International in the BBC World Service. She reported for Science\nMagazine and Health Watch, broadcast in 24 countries around the world, and currently works\nfull time in the Science Museum.\n\"In Britain,\nto prefer\nscience to\nart is a social faux\npas.\"\nunless any of those around the table have kids\nwho spend their Sunday afternoons playing on\nthe Sound Dishes in Launch Pad, I feel as though\nI 've admitted that I used to work at Sellafield.\nI say that I'm tired of Radio Four's infatuation with arts news coverage - an hour and a quarter per day in two programmes both entitled\nKaleidoscope, that's two and a half\nhours per day, and it's as if I have\nlet slip my opinion that the latest\nBHS ad is really classy television.\nI enjoy the feeling of knowing\nmore science than people on TV quiz programmes who manage to\nanswer huge strings of questions on\nhistory, art and Sanskrit Poetry and\nget really upset by not remembering that it was\nPrince Oleg who made the treaty between\nRussia and Byzantium in 911. They have the\npower to leave me feeling completely culturally\ninadequate and reaching for the encyclopedia (or\njust switching over to try and catch the BHS ad).\nWaen it comes to science, though, these people\nare puny. I laughed for hours at a contestant who\nthought a photo of a distant galaxy might have\nbeen taken by the Hubble Space Telegraph.\nNow, this contestant was possibly confused, in\nthe heat of the moment, by his extensive knowledge of the Greek culture and language. It may\nhave been that in his hurry he mistakenly substituted the suffix graph, (from the Greek\ngraphein, to write) for scope (from the Greek\nsko pee in, to see) as he recon st nic ted the word\nfrom first principles. It may be that he was making an extraordinarily clever and subtle joke\nabout the inability of the machine to see anything clearly because of errors in its construction\n(nobody's perfect, after all). But I was happy to\nbelieve that a man so well-versed in everything in\none half of the education curriculum was completely ignorant of everything in the other half.\nAnd I laughed and told everyone I knew.\nNow, I don't think there's any greater merit\nin knowing the name of a telescope than the\nname of a Russian politician. I'd quite like to\nknow more about history and art, and maybe\njust one thing about Sanskrit Poetry.\nUnfortunately, in Britain, to prefer science to art\nis a social faux pas. While this situation prevails\nI 'll just have to be comforted by the fact that\nthere are people all over the world who tuned in\nto hear me talk about bees trapped in amber and\nthe hole in the ozone layer rather than anything\neven remotely connected with history or liter a ture. And there were 15 million of them.\n\n"

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 9TH1996 NEWS\nAitken places Britain on world map\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nJonathan Aitken, the Conservative MP for Thanet South,\noutlined his vision of Britain as a strong contender in world trade\nduring a talk at Imperial College\non Wednesday. He complained\nthat present politics was too\nlocus sed on the European situ a tion, and more attention should\nhe given to the rest ot the world\nwhich accounts for 65% of\nBritain's exports.\nAlthough stating his Eurosceptic credentials, the MP did\nnot advocate withdrawing from\nEurope, and stressed the benefits\nthat the single market brought to\nBritain. He expressed the view\nthat Britain's trading position in\nEurope was advantageous, especially as Britain had fulfil cd three\nof four 'virtues' of healthy eco-nom ics: steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment.\nThe fourth, that of an export-led\nrecovery in growth, had not yet\nbeen reached, Mr Aitken indicating that that this ought to be\nachieved by increasing Britain's exports with non-European co un tries.\n\"Britain is seen as a 'paradise'\nfor inward investors\" he said, citing the example of the car indus-try, which although ironically\nalmost entirely foreign-owned, is\none of the best performing sectors in the country. However, he\ndismissed talk of Britain being\ntrapped in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe, being rather more\nconcerned that Britain might languish in the slow lane of a two-speed world. Additionally the\"\nsocial aspects of the European\nUnion, especially the Social\nChapter, came under criticism,\nthere being 'too many require-ment s' that made industry\nun competitive. Mr Aitken refused to comment on the his involvement with\nB MARC and the arms-to-Iraq\naffair, saying that he was due to\ngive evidence to the Scott inquiry\nnext month, though he refuted\nallegations in last week's papers\nthat he had changed his story.\nHowever, he did field questions\non the arms industry generally,\nsaying that he was not of the\nopinion that 'defence exports\nshouldn't happen,\" himself being\nproud of Britain's21% of the\nworld defence market. The question of morality was brushed\naside because \"Britain operates\nthe most restrictive and protective\" procedures for granting\nexport licences.\nFinishing on the subject of\nJohn Major's leadership and the\ndefection of Emma Nicholson,\nthe MP declared himself happy\nwith the Prime Minister.\nHowever, he said that he 'could-n't recognise the same act of\nprinciple' that marked out Alan\nHowarth's defection last year to\nLabour from Emma Nicholson's recent crossing of the floor to the\nLiberal Democrats, the latter\nprovoking a storm of protests.\n2:1 value dropping:\n7\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nReports by the Higher Education\nQuality Council last month indicating the proportion of 2:1 to\n2:2 degrees to be higher than at\nany other time were confirmed\nthis week when national data on\ndegree classes were published.\nThis might be perceived as a dropping of standards by those\noutside academia but Prof\nSwanson, Pro Rector lor\nEducational Quality at Imperial\nCollege, said that the basis for\nawards was arbitrary, with\nUniversities using several and\nvarious criteria lor deciding the\nclass of degree to be conferred by\nthe degree awarding body.\nAlthough Imperial College's board of Studies could shift the\nboundaries from year to year, any\nanomalous or systematic shifts\nwould be spotted by the\nUniversity of London, who have\nthe statutory power to award IC\ndegrees and a responsibility to\nensure its various constituents\ncomply with University regulations. The same applies to other\nUniversities, but the proportion\nof achieving students at a place\nlike Imperial might also be\nexpected to be greater given the\ncalibre of applicants he added.\nAnother factor in the\nchanges may be the massive\nincrease in degree awarding bodies that came about when polytechnics were granted University\nstatus in 1993. Universities can\nchoose to give degree classes by\nlooking at the criteria other good\nUniversities use in assessments\nor it might consider its students\nto be better than average and\nstep its degree class boundaries\naccordingly. Therefore, the\nsomewhat arbitrary nature of and\nrandom disc re pen cie s in degree\nclassification across the country,\ncan be explained.\nGillian Roberts, the\nRegistrar at the University of\nLondon, was not available at the\ntime of going to press and information on variations in the proportions of the various degree\nclasses awarded at University of\nLondon constituent colleges is\nnot obtainable. However, Pi, the\nstudent newspaper of University\nCollege London Union reported\nbroad fluctuations in degree class\nproportions across a range of\ndepartments at UCL over the\npast few years. Imperial\nCollege's Board of Studies, how-ever, have published papers\nshowing very little change in the\nproportions of the various\ndegrees classes awarded.\nHolocaust survivor visits IC\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nIC Jewish Society hosted a talk\nfrom Holocaust survivor Gene\nTurgel this week, in conjunction\nwith the Beth Shalom Holocaust\nMemorial Centre.\nMrs Turgel talked for an\nhour to an audience of nearly a hundred, covering her experiences of living under the Nazis.\nHer story spanned the time\nfrom the occupation of her home\ntown, Krakow in Poland, in 1939\nwhen she was thirteen, to her liberation from the Belsen death\ncamp in 1945. Before and after\nher talk, her audience were invited to walk around a display set\nup by the Beth Shalom centre\ndetailing the rise of the Nazis and\ndescribing the concentration and\nextermination camps that they\nconstructed.\nMrs Turgel sketched her\nlife, through her family's persecution by the occupying Nazis\nand their internment in a Jewish\nghetto. With her mother she was\nmoved to Auschwitz, where hundreds of prisoners a day died in\nlabour gangs working in backbreaking conditions in quarries.\nThey were moved through a number of other camps, including Berkenau and Buchenwald,\nuntil finally they were taken to\nBelsen, known as a 'finishing\ncamp'.\nThe British Army liberated\nBelsen on 15th April 1945, and\nin the unit that entered the camp\nGene met her future husband,\nNorman. They were quickly married and when Norman was de-mobbed, they went back to\nEngland to live.\nMinorities bias in Oxford\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nOxford University's entrance\nprocedures are biased against\napplicants from racial minorities\naccording to a report published\nin the latest edition of the uni-vers it y's newspaper, Cherwell.\nThe apparent favouring of\ncandidates from white, privately\neducated backgrounds was considered \"very disappointing\nindeed\" by Julia Stephenson of\nthe equal opportunities Access\nScheme.\nThe statistics showed whites\nwere four times more likely to\nget in than non-whites.\nOverseas students were only\nhalf as likely to get in as home\nstudents.\n\n"

Strike Dunham (Mekhi\nPhifer), a rival dealer, becomes a suspect while\nhis brother Victor (Isaiah Washington) confesses\nto the killing. Klein believes the Victor is protecting his younger brother, presuming that no\none would convict a hard-working family man\nwith no prior record on a confession of self\ndefence. Klein is over zealous and hounds Strike,\ntrying to get the tn rth, convinced that he is the\nmurderer.\n'Clockers' are the lowest level of drug deal-ers, selling from benches, on the streets night and\nday, round the clock. The film not only portrays\ndrug dealers and policemen, but also those trying\nto escape the vicious circle of drugs, and children\nwho see the c lockers as role models. The roles of\nthe homicide detectives (Keitel and Turturro)\nare purely secondary to this film. Director Spike\nLee concentrates on Strike's predicament as he\nbecomes a catalyst for a series of damaging\nevents set up by Klein. He will either end up\nmurdered by a his king-pin boss, Delroy Iindo,\nor he will wind up in jail.\nThere are many vivid images in Clockers,\nthe most notable ones coming from the beginning credits, which show what appear to be\npolice photographs of various anonymous bodies\nwith gunshot wounds. Another memorable\nsequence portrays a young boy, Strikes prodigy,\nshooting one of Lindo's lieutenants after being\ninspired by a computer game.\nYou can always depend on an excellent\npiece of work from Spike Lee, but in Clockers\nthe emphasis seems to wander away from the initial murder and heading more toward the\nsocial implications of living in a project. For the\nmost part this is not a problem - all the characters have been steered away from the usual\nstereotypes. \"It would be a fallacy to say eve\none in the projects is on dope, or pregnant at\nWe wanted to show the humanity that the\nple have - and it's something that you mig h necessarily see looking at the six o 'clock new\nLee.\nClockers is a heavy and intellectual film, but\nalso relies on its shocking images. Its ending is\nsomewhat unpredictable and was a welcome\nchange from what I thought would happen.\ntheatre: dead guilty\nHardly new to the West End, this production\nhas been playing since October and the initial\nmid-January close has just recently been extended to 16th March. So with the cast including\nHayley Mills (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang fame)\nand Jenny Seagrove and reviews such as\n'Impeccable' and Magnificent' from the Times,\nthings were looking promising for this thriller.\nSurprisingly for such build up the\nWednesday night performance was barely half\nfull, even with many of the audience clutching\nblue and red half-price tickets, but still I eagerly\nanticipated the curtain-up. On opening we were\ntold of a car crash, the driver had suffered a heart\nattack at the wheel and died, and the passenger\n(Seagrove) was left with a severe leg injury. The\nvictims Georgian house in SW6 is the setting for\nthe remainder of the play, where we are introduced to her visitors, the man 'who does', a counsellor and the wife of the deceased (Mills).\nThe script is very pedestrian for a thriller and it\nis not until the end of the first half is there any\ninkling of the suspicious event we should be concerned with.\nIt may have been better if I hadn't found\nJenny Seagroves' performance quite so irritating.\nShe had mastered the act of a frustrated and despairing invalid, but three months into this production she still had not learnt to limp con v inc ingly, and any change in her emotion (rage\nthrough to dejection) just involved the throwing\nof her hands in the air. Mills just about saves the\nday as the middle aged widow whose life revolves\naround baking cakes and having chats over nice\ncups of teas, but is unable to make the plot con-vinci ng. The outcome is highly predictable, when\nit eventually arrives and the verdict, if this was a film it would have gone straight to video.\n\n"

The result\nwas disappointing, but the team\nperformance was superb against a challenging opposition, in what\nwas certainly our toughest and\npossibly our most enjoyable\nmatch this season.\nIC held off the sustained\nGuys' attack with some exceptional defensive play from forwards and backs alike. It was\nonly in the dying moments that\nU DMS managed to score after\nhaving occupied the Virgins 22\nfor almost the whole half.

    "content": "chemist\nAll is well with the world. Pamela\nAnderson splashed all over last\nSunday's television, even offering an\nopinion on the Bosnia situation,\nSteve Davis playing vintage snooker\nagain and no new signs around\nCollege. All right, the last one was\nwishful thinking. I know Ian\nCaldwell is an avid reader of my\nhumble prose, so perhaps he would\ncare to satisfy my, and your, curiosity by telling us how much it has all cost. As well\nas these rays of sunshine, my lunch last Thursday\nin the JCR (fast approaching the Savoy in price\nand Linstead in quality) was cheered up immeasurably by your friends and mine, the Socialist\nWorker Student Society.\nTheir latest crusade concerns the proposal\nfrom Vice Chancellors to impose entrance fees\non fresher s; a plan already dismissed by the\nGovernment, but used to start debate on fund-ing. Not a stunningly good idea, but in the words\nof Bob Hoskins, it's good to talk. So what\nresponse do these cheeky chap pies in the SWSS\nsuggest? Lobbying those involved might be a good idea. Mais non, much better 'to shut down\nevery college.' Whilst their silly rants and loony\npolicies are all rather amusing, the joke is starting\nto wear a little thin. Don't they realise that\n'Citizen Smith' was a comedy, not a manifesto?\nHere we have a group of silly little kids playing\npolitics, whose insight rarely stretches past a poster of Che Guevara above the bed, using\ntired political statements that even Arthur\nScargill would shy away from. Don't get me\nwrong, I am not irritated with them because\nthey have opposing views; I have nothing but\nrespect for those who support Labour or the Lib\nDems. The thing that really gets me about them,\nthe Militant sU idents and of course the NUS, is\nthat they have been responsible\nfor the very low opinion that the\npublic and government have of\nstudents as a whole. I 've seen\nthese clowns in action at\nGoldsmiths, and contributions\nsuch as 'scrap Trident and the\nMonarchy to return grants to\n1979 levels' will not do an enormous amount for the cause of stu-dents. As for student funding, it\nseems to me that the problem is\nsimply the expansion of higher education at the\nlower end. A degree in peace studies with\nneedlework at the University of Nowhere\nshould not attract similar fond ing as physics at\nCambridge or even Elec Eng at Imperial (only\njoking, lads). Higher Education must be elitist,\nnot in terms of background, but intelligence. If\nthere are any spelling mistakes in this, my a rgu ment's gone for a burton.\nI dare say a good few of you, who were unable\nto get slaughtered in Southside Bar a week last\nWednesday, saw Under The Sun on BBC2,\nwhich concerned beauty pageants in America.\nBig deal, I hear you cry. But, dear reader, these\nbeauty queens were about five years old. This\nwas undoubtedly one of the best and most\ngrotesque programmes that I have ever seen. If\never evidence was needed of a troubled country,\nthis was it. The kids, of course, were quite nor-mal. The parents on the other hand were verging\non the evil, forcing their beloved daughters to\ndress in clothes that even Zsa Zsa Gabor would\nreject as over the top, in order that they might\nwin cars and large quantities of money. As for the\npageant com pere,a man who looked as suitable\nfor the job as Fred West, I shall say no more. To\nsmile like that in the company of five year olds is\njust not cricket. I quite expect stills of this documentary to be in the next Rag Mag.\nNoises, sounds and sweet\nairs - michael ny man iw te In the majestic setting of the Royal Festival Hall,\nlittle could go wrong. The musicians, all part of\nthe Michael Nyman Band, were helped in their\nefforts by loud-speakers that gave great body to\nthe sound. So, no problem there. Much of the\nwork is dominated by a strong rhythm. Units of\nrepetitive music, with the odd melody added on,\npulsate throughout. This created simple dynamics with crescendo es and acc ele ren dos, which\nthe public relished.\nContrary to much sung classical work, the\ninstruments were to the fore, but the crucial\nbacking was a little over-bearing. Shakespeare's words give some continuity, though I for one\nregretted the lack of clarity. For a quick review\nof the text, go and have a look at\nhttp://www.en.u texas. edu/benjamin/316k fall/316 k texts/ tempest.html. Or if you have a mac,\nand feel adventurous, try ftp://ftp.alumni-.caltech.edu/zim m/ Tempest.sea hq x. Every now and then, the transition from\nlyric to music and back was rough, especially in\nthe first half. It might just have been a question\nof the mixing getting smoother. The title, in fact,\noriginates in the original text. The show was\nbathed in multi-coloured lights to support the\nemotions emanating from the bits of text one\nunderstood. Overall it gave the impression of\nfilm music; films have in fact been made from\nthis story, and Nyman has already worked on\n\"Prospero's books\".\nOften, the music was out-of-date in the\nharmonics but almost minimalist in form, especially with the avoidance of cadenza at transitions, though, strangely, not at the very end. A hundred years ago, it would have most certainly\nbeen considered as vulgar, simplified and not following the proper form. Times and mentalities\nchange, though I dare say I agree with at least the\nfirst point: this was composed to be a crowd-please r. If you're into Berio and Nono, forget\nthis; there is no prolonged unresolved dissonance\nhere, no tapes whirring, just plain easy-listening.\nA good evening was had by all (well almost).\n\n"

    "content": "gig: skunk anansie +\nlong pigS ian Playing to a packed audience who were waiting to\nsee Skunk Anansie, Longpigs were a revelation.\nThey are probably among the few indie bands\nthat take the time to try and include backing\nvocals and brilliant melodies in their songs. Instead\nof replaying four or five basic guitar chords and\nyelling their head off, they showed variations in\ntheir short but sweet set. Their striking lead singer\nfaltered at the be gir r ning of new single, 'Far', but\nby the end ofthe song they had more than made\nup for it, especially with lyrics about being stoned\nand falling in love that seemed to go together hand\nin hand.\nGoing through a set that included 'She Said'\nand 'Elvis', Longpigs made the opening band,\nScthum, sound plain ordinary by comparison.\nThe only complaints I had were that they had a tendency to end their songs rather too abruptly\nand that their set was simply too short. But these\nare only trivial points. Forget bands like\nMenswear. At this rate, Longpigs will be big this\nSkunk Anansie had the crowd going before\nthey even came on. Skin uses songs like scripts in\na movie. Rage, anger, hurt and T don't give a damn' attitudes exploded on stage when she sang.\nShe seemed lost between songs, repeatedly muttering 'yeah, yeah' over and over again in an\nattempt to recover the atmosphere of their songs.\nShe has a brilliant voice sorely lacking in many\nbands as anyone lucky enough to catch the first\nWhite Room programme of the season will attest\nto .\nThe crowd went completely wild when the\ncurrent single Weak' came on. Only Skin could\nhave carried of a song that had so much hurt and\nanger contained by pride without sounding naive.\nOnly Skin would probably stage dive with a mike\nin hand and get back on in time for her vocal parts.\nBut Skunk Anansie\naren'ta one-woman\nband. Their lead guitarist is one of the best\naround. He was always\non the brink of descending into total chaos but\nnever lost control.\nGuitar rifts were loud,\nclear and full of ferocity.\nCritics have been s lagging off Skunk Anansie\nfor their seemingly never ending political and\nsocial agenda. Forget all that. That's for album\nreviews. Skunk Anansie played such a brilliant gig\nthat those 'words of wisdom' will be the last thing\non your mind. A guy I met there said he would\ntravel the length and breadth of the country to see\nthem play. Now I know why.\ninterview: cast, \u201e\u201e,\nJohn Power knows a little bit about fame. The\neponymous LP by his previous band, The La's, inspired Noel Gallagher oi Oasis to start writing\nsongs while the single, 'There She Goes' was\narguably the most memorable of the late '80s indie scene. Now, with his new band Cast, he\nseems all the more ready to take his share oi the\nfame he l eels is so obviously due to him.\n\"Now we're established and playing together\nall the time, even when we have an off day, we're\nstill brilliant. And il we play brilliantly, the roo l will rise, man. Without blowing our own thingy,\n' this band are great live.\"\nI ask Power what his plans are for'96. 'At the end of the month we're off to Japan\nand America. After that, probably in the Spring,\nwe'll be recording the new album. I 've written the\nalbum and I'd like to get it released some time this\nyear - Autumn maybe. But first we're going to re-record 'Walk Away' (from the debut album, All\nChange') and release it as the last sing el from All\nChange'. I'm going to remix it with loads of strings\nan' that.\"\nHaving done the music questions we then\nmove on to juicier ones.

What do you think to the new crop of\nBritish musicians?\n\"There's till loads of awful bands out there.,\nbut there's a couple of good ones like Oasis and\nBlack Grape who make the whole thing worth-while. There's a lot of hype going round but the\nbands who've got something worth showing -they'll be around when the hype has run out for\nthe other bands.\"\nAnd Power clearly thinks that his band is one\nof those who do have something worth showing if\nhis tip for who will be the 'next big thing' in the\nnext few years is anything to go by:\n\"Cast! I don't know. I mean, we got it together in eight months, so who knows what's around\nthe comer? I have seen a lot of energetic young\nbands but at the end of the day it comes down to\nthe music.

This is the common term\nused to denote that trendy set of people with\nwheels strapped to their feet who display\ntheir enviable skills on In-Line Skates (Roller\nBlades - like Hoover) on Kensington\nGardens' Broadwalk next to Kensington\nPalace.\nIf yon are one of the addicted, planning\non getting hooked soon or indeed if you are a skate oph obe, then you should know a few\nthings about the London Skating scene. 1993\nsaw the first converts with a handful of inline skaters meeting on summer days in\nKensington Gardens and Hyde Park, playing\nfrisbee on wheels and sunbathing on the\ngrass. One year later there were hundreds of\npractitioners and the sunbathing spots\nbecame limited. The popular circuit of the\nparks resembled Knightsbridge during the\nHarrods Sale. Complaints of wheel bound traffic interfering with the pleasures of a Sunday stroll began to pour in to the Royal\nParks Constabulary. The main plaintiffs were\nfrom that group of citizens who can still\nremember Prince Albert, and various\nante de luv ian dog-walkers. The press seized\non this newly topical recreation as a good way\nof selling papers, by highlighting and playing\nup the various conflicts between those on\nwheels and those who were more narrow\nminded. Bad show old chap - just not cricket,\neh what? The public view formed by the\nmedia's presentation of skaters as speed\nfreaks and selfish good-for-nothings meant\nthat skating inevitably received a bad rep. An accident in 1995 which resulted in the death\nof a cyclist gave the press a field day. The stories they wrote bore little relation to the\nfacts; headlines stated \"Cyclist killed by\nblader\". Something that still holds currency.\nThe papers ran this story and referred back to\nit for months, but gave very little coverage\nmuch later when the inquest was held and\nthe skater was exonerated in view of the fact\nthat he wasn't really moving and may as well\nhave been wearing shoes. This accident\ntogether with one or two others have given\nskaters a bad reputation. The fact is that\nskating has a lower accident rate than rid-ing, cycling, skiing and snow-boarding and\nis probably more fun.\nFed up with the unfair perception of\nskaters, a group got together in 1994, to\nQUEENSWAY LANCASTER GATE MARBLE ARCH Who makes the decisions!\n\u2022\nThe Parks Watch is a meeting held every few months help to decide on Park Policy. It is hosted by\nthe Royal Parks Constabulary and attended by a representative of the Royal Parks Agency, and particularly by those who like to complain about things to do with Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.\nThe meeting is not just about skating, but passions surface when skating is the next topic on\nthe agenda and those who are vehemently against skaters are all present and correct and ready to\nvote. Skaters and, indeed, non-skaters who feel that injustice abounds in the Royal Parks should\nattend these meetings to even out the votes that influence Park policy; the future of skating in the\nparks depends partly on you. It. is only the few that want skating confined to the streets. If you are\ninterested in attending (next meeting\n23rd Feb) or would\nlike to express your\nopinion on the matter please contact\nAlex Cinelli ASAP.\nleft: The skating\nroutes agreed with\nthe Royal Parks.\nHYDE PARK CORNER KNIGHTSBRIDGE try and encourage more thoughtfulness by\nskaters towards slower moving objects. They\nformed EISA; Britain's In-Line Skating\nAssociation. They produced the \"Skate Wise\"\ncode of conduct and offered membership\nwhich included \u00a31 million public liability\ninsurance, a magazine and discounts on safety\ngear in the shops. That was just to seduce the\nskaters into joining - the real core purpose\nwas to create a unified voice for skaters, to\nprovide information such as how people\ncould find an instructor, and to promote the\nsafe use of park areas for all participants - the\ngoal of the Skate Patrol.\nBISA Skate patrollers (see below) do not\nticket skaters or pull them from the trails,\nrather they monitor areas to make everyone's recreation more enjoyable by making skaters\naware of park etiquette and ordinances. They\nare able to provide on-site stopping\nKENSINGTON\nGARDENS\nFEATURE FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 9TH1996. FIFTEEN\nOrigins of in-line\nSkating\n\u2022\nThe first in-line skate was developed in the early\n1 700s by a Dutchman who wanted to practice ice\nskating in the summer by nailing wooden spools\nto strips of wood and attaching them to his shoes.\nThe next version appeared in 1 760 when a London instrument maker, Joseph Merlin, decided\nto make an entrance to a masquerade parry by\nskating in on metal-wheeled boots while playing a violin. He ended up skating into a huge mirror at\nthe end of the ballroom, not having learned to\nstop or steer.\nIn 1823, Robert John Tyers of London\ndesigned a skate called a\"rol i to\" by placing five\nwheels in a row on the bottom of a shoe. The\nro lito was not take seriously at the time.\nIn 1863 an American, James Plimpton,\nfound a way to make a workable skate. He came\nup with a four-wheel skate with two pairs of\nwheels side by side, and so the modern four-wheel roller skate was created. Roller skates\nallowed turns, and also forwards and backwards\nskating. The invention of ball bearing wheels in\n1884 helped the sport even more.\nTyers' design did not go entirely unnoticed\nhowever. In the Netherlands, after the canals had\nmelted, \"s keeler s\"(5' s) were used as a means of\ndry-land training, competition and transportation\nfor over two decades.\nFinally, in 1980, when two brothers from\nMinneapolis were rummaging through a pile of\nequipment at a sporting goods store, they found\nan old in-line skate. Scott and Brennan Olson\nwere ice hockey players and so they realized the\ncross-training potential of the in-line skate.\nThey redesigned the skate using a hockey\nboot, polyurethane wheels and adding a rubber\nheel brake, and found they could skate as they did\non ice. Soon after, they began selling skates out of\ntheir home and eventually Rollerblade Inc. was\nborn.\nThe rest is history.\ntuition to those using the parks\nand are able to communicate\nwith the local authorities regarding injuries or other incidents.\n(Girls, there are loads of cute\nguys on skate patrol. Guys, there\nare loads of cute girls on skate\npatrol. Come and learn something from them).\nBISA speaks for its members and has been involved in\nnumerous meetings with the\nRoyal Parks Agency (RPA)\nwhich wanted to put a blanket\nban on all Royal Parks. BISA\nnegotiated the deal skaters have\nnow (see map, below & left).\nSkaters have been on a six\nmonth probation since the 11th of October, pending review and\nstill liable to a complete ban. So\nskaters must all be well-behaved\nangels if they want to carry on\nskating in London's Parks. BISA\nhas also negotiated the use of\nthe area by the Albert Memorial\nfor playing roller hockey and an\narea for slalom (and have provided nets and cones). Isn't that\nnice of them! Go and try them\nout, they are loads of fun.\nThere are some other places\nto skate in London. Have you\never tried the steps behind the\nAlbert Hall or Trafalgar Square?\nThe Southbank Centre has a few\nsurprises awaiting you as well.\nGood learning steps are to be\nfound at the forecourt of\nImperial College, on Exhibition\nRoad.\nWritten by Alex Cinelli.\nAlex would like to thank Sacha\nSkipwith and Dawn Irwin of\nthe B. I.S. A for their help and\ncollaboration.\nSkate to Fitness\n\u2022\nThe faster you in-line skate, the higher your aerobic\nrequirement. In-line skating generally delivers an\naerobic work-out more beneficial than cycling, but\nless so than running. This is due to the fact that\ncyclists and skaters can coast but runners can't! Unlike cycling, skating develops hamstring\nmuscles and provides a much better anaerobic work\nout than running which will therefore improve the\noverall aerobic capacity. Also, as well as developing\nmuscular strength and endurance in the lower\nbody, skating will improve balance and co-or dina tion.\nSkating at imperial\n\u2022\nSkating is healthy, fun and a good way to meet people of the opposite sex (of the toned and healthy\ngood-looking variety), fast or slow, as you like it.\nThere are stunts to be done, tricks to be learned,\nramps to be catapulted from, hockey to be played,\nslaloms to snake through, street skates at night for\nthe adventurous and dance nights for the brave.\nThe Imperial College Skating Club offers these\nopportunities and much much more. If you would\nlike to get started or participate in any of the above\nactivities, if you have any questions or would simply like to meet the tall, toned, healthy and good-looking(!) Captain of the Club, do not hesitate to\ncontact Alex Cinelli, Aero UG III\n(a. cine lli@ ic.ac.uk)\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX The student newspaper of\nImperial College\nIssue 1049\nFebruary 9th1996 Tories plan to abolish student grants\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nGovernment plans to abolish\nmaintenance grants for students\nand impose a 'graduate tax' have\nbeen revealed this week. The\nproposals would scrap the existing system of grants and loans in\nfavour of compulsory loans\nrepaid through national insurance\ncontributions.\nThe new approach to student finances, launched this\nweek by the Conservative\nPolitical Centre, would not affect\nfunding of tuition fees. They aim\nto release the \u00a31.7 billion spent\nannually on student financial sup-port, which amounts to about\n30% of the total spending on\nhigher education. This money\nwould then be used to fund\nteaching and research, perhaps in\nlieu of some current funding.\nSimilar schemes have been operating in Australia and New\nZealand for several years.\nThe scheme is intended to\nbe funded by the private sector,\nwith money from banks and pension schemes. This could potentially cause problems for the gov-ern ment. Last year, the high\nstreet banks refused to become\ninvolved with the present\nStudent Loans system, fearing it\nto be a financial liability. They\nmay be cautious about investing\nsuch large sums of money.\nAs a result of this, the plan's authors recommend that the\nmaintenance loans scheme\nshould first be tested using postgraduate students as guinea pigs\nfor the new funding, in order to\niron out problems and reassure\ninvestors.\nCVCP meets on funding page 3\nAUT resists cuts Page3 Students drop in to ICU\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nTwo Royal School of Mines students face ICU disciplinary\naction this afternoon after falling\nthrough the ceiling of the union\nbuilding during a break-in.\nThe students were attempting to gain entry to ICU's Beit\nQuad premises in the early hours\nof last Friday morning when they\nbrought down part of an insulating ceiling, landing in the Union\nPrint Unit. They broke in via a street-level window off Bremncr\nRoad, after an altercation with\nICU stewards on being asked to\nleave the premises at closing\ntime.\nThe youths fell through the\nfalse ceiling of the room which\nhouses ICU's presses and printing equipment. They brought\ndown several ceiling panels,\nbuckling the frame which supports the insulating roof.\nThe students met Union\nstaff, and claimed to be 'lost'.\nCollege security were alerted,\nand the students subsequently\nsigned full confessions, offering\nto pay the for the damage. The\nbill for the repairs, which\ninvolved calling out an emergency engineer to replace the\nglass at 12.30am on Friday morn-ing, may come to several hundred pounds. It is not known\nwhat punishment the disciplinary committee is likely to\nimpose.\nElection Reticence\nAfter a slow start to the week,\nonly one candidate is fully seconded for his position in the sabbatical elections for next year's union officers. Nominations are\nopen for a further week, page 3\nJonathan Aitken at IC\nJonathan Aitken MP spoke at\nImperial's Conservative Society\non Wednesday, outlining his\nvision of Britain's place in the\nworld, and talking on the future\nof Conservatism. page 2\n2:1 or 2:2?\nThe value of the 2:1 degree classification came under scrutiny\nthis week as it was revealed that\nthe number of 2:1 awarded\nnationwide was comparable to\nthe number of 2:2s. page 2\n\n"

We have four\nvery different bands playing, and so you can\nhave some idea of the styles, we have got\neach of the bands to describe themselves: no\neasy feat...\nThe evening kicks off with a band by the\nname of Neither Both: J.

Owen\n(guitar / vocals) met by chance after being\nenlisted by Noddy Holder (formally of\nSlade) for an ambitious jazz exploration.\nThey decided to go it alone after discovering\na shared interest in quality 80's pop\n(Squeeze, The Police) and a mysterious\ncharacter from Liverpool, Purple Ackey\n(Check out the song).

They are a four-piece\nandrogen o us fronted (Huh ?) melding of an\naloof techno programmer/guitarist, two lead\nsingers, potentially stable drummer, a bass\nboy, and a guitar girl. \"Just remember what\nyour Momma used to do to your trousers....\"\nYes, well...\nThe third band call themselves Urban\nSpice, and say \"don't f'*** ing bother with\nthe rock disco in the UD H.

The Rector\nhimself has in the past been fairly open in his disapproval of the\nstance taken by the CVC P, so\nit's seems odd that we shouldn't have the IC position on student\nfunding made clear.

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 9TH1996. THREE\nLevy fees imminent, but not for IC\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) met at the University of\nLondon last Friday to discuss\nimposing a 'top-up' levy on students in order to make up the\ndeficit in the funding of Universities and Colleges next year.\nIn an extremely unusual\nmove, the committee held a vote\non the idea, resulting in a decision to impose a \"government\ndeficit levy\" from October 1997\nif the next Budget does not\nincrease funding. The size of this\nlevy is undecided. A one-off\ncharge of \u00a3300 per student has\nbeen suggested, but one university head has said that would be\ninadequate, proposing a\" real is tic\" levy of up to \u00a31000 per year.\nThe Committee is also\nthreatening to withdraw from\nother Government schemes,\nincluding quality assessment, ip\nJanuary 1997. These measures\nare timed to have maximum\npolitical effect on the Government, which will be facing an\nimminent general election.\nThe Committee will withdraw if the Government does not\nmake two concessions: firstly,\nthis year's budget must include\n\"some significant reversal\" of the\ncapital cuts in last year's Budget.\nSecondly, they must signal an\nintention to introduce an\nincome-contingent loans scheme\ncovering both fees and maintenance by 1999. These measures\nwill be discussed at a meeting\nbetween CVC P leaders and\nEducation Secretary Gillian\nShephard this week.\nHowever, support for these\nmeasures is by no means unanimous within the Committee. A poll conducted by the Times\nHigher Education Supplement\nlast week revealed that, of the\ntwenty-five universities against\nthe imposition of levies, only\neight planned to go ahead with\nthe scheme if the majority was in\nfavour. The proposal to withdraw\nfrom quality assessment schemes\nhas also been attacked as \"utterly\nself destructive\". The final decision on whether to impose these\nmeasures will be made in\nDecember.\nThe Rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, has reiterated Imperial\nCollege's opposition to imposing\ntop-up fees: \"IC has no intention\nof charging a \u00a3300 fee - it would\nachieve almost nothing for the\nCollege.\" He added: \"It is the\nclear view of the heads of departments that we would not impose\na system that disadvantaged the\nless well-off student.\"\nAlternative options for the CVCP\nIt would be possible to increase Principals, who have been meet-available funding per student by\nreducing the number of students\nadmitted. The Higher Education\nFunding Council for England\n(HEFCE) said last week that the\noption ol reducing student intake\nhas been left \"deliberately open\"\n(Felix 1048). However, the\nStanding Conference of\ning the CVC P to discuss funding\ncuts, have said that college heads\nare sceptical about reducing student numbers without guarantees that funding levels would be\nunaffected.\nThe deadline for universities\nto submit student level information to the HE FCE is today.\nAUT ally with CVCP\nThe Association of University\nTeachers has rejected the possibility of industrial action as a protest at the budget cuts. In an\nunprecedented move, the Union\nis seeking to ally with the CVC P to fight the cuts. This has caused\ncontroversy within the organ is a tion, leading one member to\ndescribe it as \"shackling ourselves\nto the enemy\".\nSince Colleges can spend up\nto 80% of their budget on staff\nsalaries, the funding crisis could\nseriously damage the union's chances with their 1996/97 pay\nclaim. The claim does not yet\nspecify a desired percentage rise,\nbut attempts to introduce a claim\nfor a10% rise or a \u00a33,000\nincrease at all salary levels have\ntailed.\nThe Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals met at Senate\nHouse on Malet Street last Friday. Students from a number of\nLondon Colleges and provincial universities turned out to demonstrate outside the building whilst the Committee met.\nSlow Start to Sab Elections\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nAs Felix went to press, only one\ncandidate has been fully seconded in their bid to stand for next\nyear's ICU sabbatical positions.\nPiers Williams, a final year\nchemist and chair of the Union's publications' board, was the first\nto sign up on Monday. He is\nstanding for the position of\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices) and was fully seconded\nby Wednesday.\nThe only person who has\nstood for the position of\nPresident so far is Mark Bridge, a first year chemistry student, but\nit is widely expected that Eric\nAllsop, the current chair of ICU council, will put forward his candidature this evening.\nNeil O 'Shaughnessy, a Union steward, has stood for the\nposition of Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), leaving\nthe post of Felix Editor / Print\nUnit Manager with no contestants at all. It is expected that\nAlex Feakes, currently news editor of Felix, will stand for the\nposition.\nNominations papers will be\nposted outside the union office\nfor a further week, after which\nthe candidates are allowed two\nweeks for campaigning. Hustings\nwill be held at ICU on Tuesday\nFebruary 27th, and at St Mary's on Wednesday February 28th. Voting will take place in all\ndepartments on March 4th and\n5th. "

    "content": "exhibition: cezanne hark1 As you have probably gathered from all the\nhype of the last week, the Cezanne exhibition\nhas arrived at the Tate yesterday. All tastes are\ncatered for: whether you're a mere passer-by\nlooking for a few (well, over a hundred) fine\npaintings, an art historian studying the evolution\nof Cezanne's work, or an accomplished artist\nsearching for inspiration: it's all here.\nThe Cezanne exhibition is one of the largest\never put together and is a rare opportunity to\nassess the many facets of a very influential\npainter. From the dark and gloomy start, when\nhe was looking for his way, to the mature years,\nwhen he openly preached post-impressionism,\nand onto the final stages with what many hail as\nhis masterpiece, the Grande Baigneuses: it's all\nhere.\nOne can all but see the evolution of his ideas\nand how he came to formulate his theories.\nSome people give their vision of the world with\nothers painters' techniques. Cezanne used his\nvision of what technique should be, to create a new world. Some people are popular, but are\nhated by the pros because of their excessive sim-pli fi cation. Cezanne stunned the art world with\nhis theories, but was never popular in his own\nlife-time.\nCezanne had an incredible ability to play\nwith light purely in colour terms, by juxtaposing\ncarefully worked brush strokes. Some paintings\nare dark, others are light, but unlike the classical\nperiod, it is the whole canvas that is infused with\nlight. He managed to transcend the academia of\nthe day, while still portraying the magic of mother Nature - something the twentieth century\nfailed to catch on to.\nThe exhibition is a great opportunity to see\nthese paintings in a large format, with their true\ncolours and brilliance. It is fabulous to be able to\nstand back twenty feet, and see the overall har-mon y; this could never be achieved through\nbooks alone. There are ten rooms arranged\nchronologically, so that the themes of each phase\nare clearly visible. These include two rooms dedicated to his water-colours and drawings (one for\neach of the earlier and the later phases). These\ngive a great insight into his home life as well as his\napproach of the subject matter.\nYou also have a unique opportunity to see\nfor yourself why the twentieth century artists\nclaimed him their godfather. The French\ncrowds, mad as they may be, flocked in their\nhundreds of thousands to the exhibition at the\nGrand Palais. So, who knows, you might get a glimpse of what Cezanne was, and is, all about,\nbut be prepared to spend an hour or two going\nover it. You'll be amazed.\nIf you missed your chance in 1907, don't miss this one.\nadr ra&ss on. \u00a37 rv or tna l fire,\ndei\nIP; R, x:>li\"^ Ipniil\nFRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\ne best student offer in london!
