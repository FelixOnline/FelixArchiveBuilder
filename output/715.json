    "content": "NOTHING/DOTING/\nBLINDNESS\nHenry Green\nThree novels, each fairly\nintellectual and dealing a lot with the emotions. All\nare brilliantly written, but,\ndue to the many cross-currents within them make\ndifficult going. Nothing and\nDoting are both quite\namusing, but Blindness,\nabout a writer blinded as a boy, is more bleak and\nmorbid. (Picador, \u00a32.95)\nBY THE WATERS OF\nLIVERPOOL\nHelen Forrester\nThis is part of Helen's autobiography describing\nher childhood in Liverpool\nduring the 1930's and war\nyears, including the time\nshe was suspected of being\na5 th Columnist. It does not\nmake galvani sing reading.\n(Fontana, \u00a31.95)\nMURPHY\nSamuel Beckett\nAnother intellectual is t book\n- and another involving\nbooks\nmental illness. This time\nthe central character is\nMurphy from (where else)\nIreland, who works in a mental hospital. Strangely\nfor Beckett, there are even\na few laughs, but it is not a light book, and I found I could only fully appreciate\nit on the third reading.\n(Picador \u00a32.95)\nWILT ON HIGH\nTom Sharpe\nThis is billed as vulgar,\nlavatory humour, but it\nreally is a good funny\nstory, less sexist than I imagined it to be. It takes\nthe Mickey out of several\nself-satisfied organisations\n- the medical and security\nforces among them. Should\nappeal to most Imperial\nmen. (Pan, \u00a31.95)\nTHE ANGRY MOUNTAIN\nHammond Innes\nMore stirring Boys-OwnPaper adventure stuff, for\nlads who want men to be\nmen, women to be women\n(but not lesbians), and\nsmall furry creatures from\nAlpha Centauri to be shot\non sight. The characters\nare predictable - a Hero\ntortured by memories, an\nEvil Villain, plus a bit of\nskirt... sorry, romantic\ninterest in the shape of a lovely Contessa. Definite\npulp. (Fontana, \u00a31.50)\nTHE LEOPARD HUNTS IN\nDARKNESS\nWilbur Smith\nSuprisingly, not a very bad\nbook, one of its main\ndefects being peoples'\ncharacters portrayed as\ngood or bad - there are no\nshades of grey. The plot\ndevelops into Great White\nHope versus Evil Power\nCrazed Chief, but\ndescriptions of the\nZimbabwian country are\nwor h reading reading even\nif the rest of the book is\ntrash. (Pan \u00a32.95)\n>\nLACE II\nShirley Conran\nDon't bother.\n\\MorT\nemits various painful\nsc reaches when it knobs\nare twisted. The lead\nsinger, a female punk\nmidget who has an\ninc red ably large mouth and\nstrong vocal chords,\ndemonstrated that it is still\npossible to sing with the\nmicrophone c len ced between ther teeth.\nConsequently, the lyrics\nwere incoherent but what I think I heard was:\nIf you drive a car,\nthen someday you're going\nto crash;\nCrash into me\n-up me\nram into me\n-ram it up me\nin a lay-by\n-lay me.\nHowever, I would accept\nthat the above had been\nheavily influenced by my\nimagination.\nBands that have amassed\na large cult followings and\nlimited chart success tend\nto play at the Hammersmith\nPalais, although it is\nnoticeable that double bills\nof lesser know bands are\nplaying more frequently\nhere due to the regretful\nclosure of the Lyceum\nBallroom earlier this year,\nwhose site was most\ncompatible to these bands\nrequirements.\nOccassionally the\nHammersmith Odeon is\nused, although this is\nrather unfortunate since it\nis an all seated affair and\nimposes obvious\nrestrictions. Examples of\nother bands are the Cure,\nNew Order, Echo and the\nBunneymen, Spear of\nDestiny, Killing Joke, the\nCult, Siouzie and the\nBanshees and others. Both\nthe Palais and Odeon have\ngood acc oust ics and\nconsequently, the concerts\nare of a high standard.\nThe smaller concert halls\ninclude the Clarendon\nBallroom (Hammersmith)\nMarquee (Soho) which is\nsoon due for expansion,\nElectric Ballroom (Camden\nand the Greyhound\n(Fulham). To a small\nextent, ULU is also used.\nIn this piece it has been\nimpossible to describe\nevery sub-category, let\nalone every band\u2014try\nlooking at Time Out listings\nto appreciate the number;\ninfact, I have only\nmentioned a few of the\nbetter known ones. The\narticle is also very dated\nsince bands and styles are\nconstantly changing and\nthis is why the music is\nexciting, currently the\nJesus And Mary Chain are\nthe 'in-thing'; to see them\nin concert would do to your\nstreet-c red what seeing the\nSex Pistols would have\ndo no eight years earlier. Do\nnot expect to see much\nthough, if you are lucky,\nthen they might play for\ntwenty minutes and then\nthe audience might destroy\nthe concert hall.\nTo answer the title, I hope|\nthis article has made you\nmore perplexed as to why\nanybody enjoys listening to\nthis 'music' so that you are\nstuck with that 'ever so nice\nsounding pulp'\u2014alternative\nanswer, or what?\nFELIX Friday 4 October 11\n\n"

    "content": "Southside Security\nDear Freshers,\nI would like to bring to\nyour attention the following\nfacts regarding Security at\nImperial.\n1. Over the summer, over\n\u00a39000 of personal\npossessions was stolen\nfrom people staying in\nLinstead Hall. It is generally\naccepted that this was\naccomplished by the use of\na master key on rooms in\nthe Linstead Extension.\nCollege have not changed\nthe locks on the burgled\nrooms and so the thief can\ncarry out an identical\noperation at anytime in the\nfuture. Depending on the\ntype of master key used\n(which is unknown) any\nstudent in any Hall of\nResidence may be\nvulnerable to burglary.\n2. Access to Southside\nHalls may be gained\nusually by the FalmouthTizard door entrances\nwhich do not shut properly\ndue to insufficient force in\nthe closing springs. In any\ncase, undesirables may be\nunwittingly admitted by\nresidents who open doors\nand do not challenge\nstrangers waiting outside.\nThe outer door at the\nKeogh-Selkirk end\nfrequently does not close\nsecurely which allows easy\naccess once more.\n3. In the same area, ie\nbetween the outer and\ninner doors of the KeoghSelkirk end of Southside\nthere is a rape alarm. You\nmay not have noticed this\nbecause it is not labelled. It\nis a small, brushed\naluminium box opposite the\nkey card lock and remains\nun labelled because\nSecurity do not have a key\nto turn it off in case of\naccidental (or indeed\nintentional) activation. You\noperate it by inserting your\nfingers upwards from the\nbase into the box.\n4. It is well known that a certain Security Guard in\nLinstead arrives for his\nshift, sets an alarm clock\nfor his next round (about 2\nhours later) and then goes\nto sleep on a camp bed.\nEffectively, there is no\nNight Security on the\nnights when this Guard is\non duty. It is coincidental\nthat this Guard was on duty\non the night of the Linstead\nburgle ry this summer.\n5. The 'red flashing light'\nsecurity system at the\nFalmouth-Tizard end of\n'Useless' Films\nDear Sir,\nWe were interested to read\nthe letter in FELIX No 713\nfrom Dave Clements, in\nwhich our films, shown last\nyear, were described as\n'useless'.\nWe wondered whether\nother students would agree\nthat 'Ghandi', 'Merry\nChristmas Mr Lawrence',\n'War games', 'Paths of\nGlory', 'Dr Strangelove',\n'Sophies Choice' etc were\n'useless'. However, we all\nquite liked them.\nYours faithfully\nRosemary Dickin\nMark Harman\nICCND\nSouthside may be turned off\nby means of a very obvious\nswitch next to the red\nflashing light. Security did\nnot come to inspect this for\nat least an hour.\nI would advise all\nstudents to take the utmost\ncare in protecting their\nbelongings because it is\nevident from the above\n(situation as of September\n18) that College Block is\nnot worried about breaches\nof Security and hence does\nnot care about the students\nat Imperial.\nYours faithfully\nSimon Banton (Physics 82-85)\nSelkirk Alterations\nDear Editor,\nAs represent it ives of Selkirk\nHall, we would like to\nprotest at the blatant\nin consideration and\ncomplete lack of sympathy\nwith which Imperial College\nhas approached the\nalterations currently taking\nplace in the halls of\nresidence on Southside.\nWithout consultation with\nany student represent it ives, the College has decided to\ncarry out major alterations\nwithin the halls, which will\nhave profound\nconsequences for the\nsocial life and thus the\nquality of life in the halls.\nLaundry and central\ncooking facilities are being\nclosed, and rooms on each\nstaircase are being\nconverted into small\nkitchens, with a corresponding loss of\nrevenue to the college.\nAlthough there is no doubt\nthat some changes were\nnecessary, these plans are\nabout to be implemented\nwith neither consultation\nwith, nor the support of,\nthe students who must Jive\nand work under\nconsiderable\ninconvenience.\nWork has started already\non some of the\nconversions, and appears\nto be timed to coincide\nwith fresher s week, when\nhundreds of new students\nwill be gaining their first\nimpressions of Imperial\nCollege. Clearly, this will\nnot show the College to its\nbest advantage, nor will it\nmake life easier for the re-aps, whose preparations\nare already being disrupted\nto a considerable extent.\nWhy was work not at\nleast started over the\nsummer holidays? Does\nImperial now consider the\ntemporary summer\nresidents are that much\nmore important than its\nstudents?\nYours Sincerely,\nThe re-aps of Selkirk Hall\nRH Yeoman, Clive\nFreeman, DR Shipley, CE Sutchwill, A Shields.\n* E Ji Bars\nRob Northey came to\nImperial just over six\nmonths ago. He was hailed\nas the answer to the\nCollege's bar and refectory\nproblems. He was seen as\nthe young innovative\nmanager needed to sort the\ndecaying mess Victor\nMooney had managed to\nleave. In the last six months\nhe has supported\nSouthside Bar Manager\nRoger Pownell's attempts\nto make Southside into the\nsort of bar where most\nstudents would like to\ndrink. He has decided to\nopen a refectory in\nto fia Southside that will sell wine\nbar food in the evening. He\nhas attempted to rid the\nrefectories of some of their\nmost in com pet ant staff. All\nthese changes are the sort\nof improvements that\nstudents were hoping for\nwhen he took over.\nUnfortunately, though, he\nhas no understanding of\nthe way the Union Bar\nWorks. The Union Bar has\ntwo functions: it is\ndesigned to service the big\nparties like Carnival. It is\nalso designed for the bar to\nbe used by the Rugby\nclubs CCUs etc when they\nwant to get drunk. It is built\nto withstand people trying\nto smash it up. The staff\nemployed know how to\nhandle a hundred drunk\nrugby players. It isn't designed to appeal to\npeople out for a quiet\ndrink.\nMr Northey has refused\nto except the system that\nexists in the Union Bar. He\nhas not supported Doug\nArmstrong and Brian\nEllision who know just how\nto run the Union. He has\nallie nate d the excel lant set\nof casuals that Doug and\nBrian recruited by asking\nfor their National Insurance\nnumbers. The Union has\nhad little or no investment.\nIt is almost as though he\nhas set out to get rid of\nBrian and Doug by making\ntheir situation impossible.\nToday Carnival is taking\nplace in the Union. It's just\nthe sort of event where the\nexperience of Brian and\nDoug is essential.\nUnfortunately the event is\nlikely to be chaos. There is\nunlikely to be enough\nexperienced staff to run the\nbar. Carnival may well be\nruined because without a late bar it will be a waste of\ntime.\nThere is very little Rob\nNorthey can do about\nbringing Brian and Doug\nback. He could try\napo lig ising to them both.\nTempers are such, though,\nthat there is very little\nchance of them coming\nback.\nCarl Burgess\nAt around 5.00pm on\nWednesday evening Carl\nBurgess walked into the\nFELIX office. He informed\nus that he was proposing a FELIX\nFriday 4 October\n\n"

Michael Foot\nwill be unveiling a memorial to the dead of the\nInternational Brigade in the\nSpanish Civil War, 48,000\nvolunteers from 53 different\ncountries went to Spain in\nthe first stand of democrats\nand socialists against\nfascism (and Spain was the\nlast country in Europe to\nbe free from Fascism.).\nFive hundred of the\nBritish battalion, named\nafter Clement Atlee, were\nkilled, and 1200 wounded,\nout of 2000 volunteers.\nEnough history; be at\nJubillee Gardens, on the\nSouth Bank at 12 noon, or\nat Beit Arch at 11.30.\nWith the expected visit to\nIC later this term of Keith\nJoseph, we hope to have a speaker ourselves from the\nNational Union of\nTeachers, and to mount a peaceful but unfriendly\npicket to greet Sir Keith.\nThen, watch out for Tarn\nDalyell, MP, who will be in\nCollege to speak to a Soc\nSoc meeting on Thurday 14\nNovember.\nAfter many years in\nParliament as a specialist in\nscience and Technology ,\nMr Dalyell should have a great deal to say to anyone\nat IC.\nHG Wells Society\nThe HG Wells Society is\ncelebrating the centenary,\nthis year, of Well's student\ndays at the college. These\ncelebrations include a fantastic series of our\nregular Monday night\nmeetings including such\nguests as Dr Edward de\nBono, Patrick Reid MBE,\nNigel Calder, Douglas\nAdams.\nThe first meeting is this\nMonday, 7 October, at\n7.30pm in Mech Eng 220,\nwhen Michael Bentine,\nbrilliant comedian and\npresenter, will be talking\nabout his life-long interest\nin the psychic powers of\nthe mind, or The Doors of\nthe Mind. Prof Eric\nLaithwaite, our President\nwill chair the meeting, and\nat the end Michael Bentine\nwill make the draw for a raffle in aid of Save the\nChildren.\nWith the famines of\nEthiopia and Sudan the\nplight of children has\ngrown even worse. Usually\nthe children, being the\nweakest and with the\ngreatest needs, suffer first\nin the poverty of the third\nWorld. The statistics of\nmalnutrition and starvation\nare horrifying. They need\nour help, no matter how\nsmall is our contribution.\nThis year our society has\norganised a raffle , you will\nsee the leaflets advertising\nit soon. All the profits,\nevery single penny, will go\nto Save the Children. The\ntickets cost 20p each. I urge you to either donate\nsome money, or to buy\nsome tickets. Your support\nis needed.\nWhy not come and hear\nthe children's favourite\ncomedian, Michael Bentine,\njoin the best society in\nCollege, and help the\nsuffering children around\nthe world.\nBalloon Club\nHe awoke to the soft blue\nlight filtering through the\ncurtains and turned over.\nThe girl, disturbed by his\nmovement, opened her\neyes and murmured: 'I love\nyou.' Her arms tightened\naround him. For one\nblissful moment he began\nto sink into the warmth\nwith not entirely virtuous\nthoughts.\nAnd then the realisation\nhit him: Blue light. 'My\nGod, it's fly able!' he cried,\nand was out of bed, and\naway.\nThe sacrifices made to\ngo ballooning aren't alway\nas great as this, of course.\nBut when the summer has\nbeen as bad as it has this\nyear, us balloonists get\ndesperate.\nThis was the summer\nwhen almost every chance\nto fly was ruined by rain.\nWe still saw plenty of the\ncountry (the Lake District\nand the Peak District, I'm told, look their best in the\nrain. ) We tried a cross\nLondon flight on several\noccasions. These can only\nbe attempted on the few\ntimes a year when air traffic\ncontrollers co-operate by\nrescheduling aeroplane\nflights. Yet again it rained.\nBut sometimes\neverything goes right and\nthe sacrifices seem\nworthwhile. At the Bristol\nBalloon Fiesta the rain\nstopped, the clouds parted,\nand 97 ballo o on s took off\nfrom a single field to float\ngently over Bristol and then\nout over Bath.\nThis term we are hoping\nto go to the meets at\nKettlewell on the Yorkshire\nmoors, and to Humber, and\nthere will be plenty of short\ntrips (a day or an evening)\nto Newbury. There'll\ncertainly be plenty of\ndisturbed nights sleep...\nIC Socialist Society: they will be at the Jubilee Gardens on\nthe South Bank at 12 noon tomorrow to watch Michael\nFoot unveil a memorial\n12 Friday 4 October FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "London is world famous for the variety of music it\noffers its residents every night. The alternative\nmusic performed by wie rd bands in even wie r der venues is often overlooked, though. In this article\nChristopher Murray writes about his experiences\nof alternative music\nProbably the most\nmemorable concert of all\nthose that I have attended\nwas Einsturzende\nNeubaten's affair. Doubts\nbegan on the discovery that\nthe venue, Heaven, is a notorious gay night club,\nalthough, perhaps I should\nhave guessed this from its\nFreudian location; that is,\nthrust im between one of\nthe Charing Cross arches.\nTo be fair, the only\nevidence of the arse-bandit\nfraternity were the butch\nmas touched clone barman\nand a neon display that\noccassionally advertised\n'Mr Gay UK' as one of the\nforthcoming events.\nThe venue complimented\nthe music, which can only\nbe described as 'different'.\nThe percussion in\nparticular was not quite\nwhat had been expected: in\nfact, it looked as if it had\nbeen constructed from\nparts obtained from a breaker's yard: It was\nremarkable that when the\n'instruments' and the\nscreams of Blixa Bargeld,\nthe vocalist who has the\nappearance of a skeleton\nwith skin shrink wrapt\naround it, co-ordinated an\nimpressive sound was\nproduced. Unfortunately,\nthese moments were very\nsparse owing to\ndisagreements amongst the\nband and power failures.\nBargeld is probably\nbetter known for his\ninvolvement with Nick Cave\nand The Bad Seeds, to\nwhom my initial response\nwas utter repulsion since\nthere is not one feature of\ntheir music that this\nendearing on the first\nlistening. Cave's music can\nbe described as a fusion of\nblues and punk, which in\nspite of its outwardly\nraucous nature is\nsurprisingly sensitive at\nit mes; His previous band,\nthe Birthday Party, was\neven more overt and is now\nregret ably de fun t. The\nconcerts are unique: Cave\nstaggers on stage, stoned,\nwearing a bow tie and\nwaist-coat; he stands, eyes\nglazed, someone shouts\nout, 'Do you what to buy\nsome s mak?' and then he\nbegins in wails and\ncontorts himself. His arm's is twisted behind his back,\nbody doubled-over when\nsinging a repressive song\nand disfigures himself to\nother positions according\nto and as the mood of\nmusic changes. This\nprobably reads like an 'I 've\nseen the light after being\npreached to by Billy\nGraham' monologue,\nhowever, the heart and soul\nof the music of many of\nthese bands is lost in the\nproduction when\ntransfering it to vinyl,\ncertainly, the Cult, Spear of\nDestiny and Killing Joke\nare good examples of\nbands who are affected by\nthis complaint.\nthe lyrics\nI therefore have to ask\nmyself whether I am\ngrowing old or are the\npresent day bands\nincapable of producing\nlyrics that compare with\nthose of the Clash, Theatre\nof Hate, Paul Weller and\nothers?\nThe television\nprogramme, the Tube, once\ndid an investigation about\nwhy people went to Three\nJohn's and Redskins's concerts, both of which are\nvery left-wing bands, for\nthe politics or for the\nmusic? Typical answers\nwere:\n'Well I think the band tow\nthe party line too much.'\n'I'm a bit to the left of them,\ny 'know, I'd like to see a bit\nmore violence'.\nThe Three Johns are\nactually worth listening to\nand infact most of their\nsongs are apolitical.\nNew Model Army are\nanother example. They are\nreasonably talented even if\nthe level of subtly\ndegenerates to 'I believe in\ngetting the bastards'\nattitudes.\nThe faction of alternative\nmusic that best\ndemonstrates the departure\nfrom it s origins is Goth,\nwhich, although music is\nreasonable, has moronic\nand crass heavy metal\nlyrics. Gothic music deals\nwith sinister dark age's depression, supernatural\nand superstition, so\nconsequently, songs tend\nto be about tr an tula s squeezing in and out of the\neye sockets of put rif ying skulls and entitled, as the\nThree Johns suggested,\n'Black cloud over Watford'.\nThe typical gothic person is\neasily recognisable from\nthe black peacock hair cut,\nthe black skin tight attire\nand the magpie lust of\nshinny jewelry. The Sisters\nof Mercy, now demised, is\na good example of this type\nof band; Andy Eldrich, the\nlead singer and an Oxford\ngraduate (well its the only\noption after the civil service\nreject you) walks in with\nthe rest of the band, all\nclad in black flasher macs\nand sunglasses, Other\nGoth groups in cude Xmal\nDeutschland, Skeletal\nFamily and Death in June.\nThe latter is probably the\nonly original one, although\nin the same sense as a circus freak would be: they\nare a Fascist band having\npro u ced some great\nnumbers such as 'C 'est un\nre ve', which is about Klaus\nBarbi, the butcher of\nToulouse.\nSi\nWHA OPA yA MEAN\nI'M A VANDALISM ?\nSong \u2022\nFJack in 77, Punk could\nbe described as being\n'socially aware'; nowdays\nbands that have a punk\nlabel amount to little more\nthan screaming and\nshouting outfits and if their\nlyrics can be understood,\nthe the vast majority of\ntheir music deals with the\nnocturnal activities of the\nvocalist's member, or what\nhe would like to believe it is\ndoing. Those few that are\npolitically motivated tend to\nrevel in slogans or make it\nimpossible to distinguish\nThere are, however,\nexceptions, Billy Bragg for\none who, apart from his\nsong-writing talents, is also\ncapable of interacting well\nwith his audience: The\nquote 'I wrote this song for\nToyah Wilcox, but as yet\nshe hasn't had the fucking\ngood grace to cover it, so\nI'm stuck with singing the\nbastard thing myself,\nsprings to mind; In fact, his\npowers of oration are such\nthat he has turned a hostile\naudience of Clash fans\ncompletely around.\nSome of their past concerts\nhave ended in police raids\nand stabbings,\nconsequently at the one I attended, a through body\nsearch was carried out on\nentrance and by the time I had arrived quite a considerable pile of\noffending objects had\naccumulated; still worries\nwere allayed by the rather\nimpressive build up to DIJ's arrival: it consisted of\nvarious 1930's depressed\nGermanic folk songs such\nas 'Ich bin ein Einsteiner',\nthus by the time the band\nwalked on stage, members\nof the front row were\nsaluting and goose-steeping. In retrospect,\nthey were an anti-climax,\nhaving followed Annie\nAnxiety, the support, who\ndefy any categorisation:\nthey produced\nmonotonous, god-awful\nwailing to drum beat\nnoises; the only instrument\nthat is arguable tuneful is a scraping violin and only\nbecause it is accompanied\nby a Trascendiant 2000, an\nexcellent machine that\nMore If\"\u00ae* 11\nFriday 4 October FELIX\n\n"

Images\nof bondage, bestiality,\nsadism, nymphomania and\nthe fantasies of a rapist?\nShowing these images, and\nsupporting the rapist's motivations? Degradation,\nand sexism? Freedom, and\nlicense?\nAn attempt has been\nmade, over the past three\nyears, to debate these\nquestions. Though the\nattempt for informed and\nserious discussion failed, it\ndid succeed in stopping\nRSMU Rugby Club from\nshowing hard-core\npornography. Also it\nbrought to the surface,\nanger, hatred and\nignorance.\nDuring the 'hard-core'\npornography debate\ntempers flared, threats of\nviolence were used, sick\ninsults made. Intimidation\nand character as s as i nation were a part of the tactics\nemployed by the RSM\nsupporters. The very issue\nat stake, the destruction of\nthe humanity of women,\nand wider still, people, was\nused as a weapon in the\ndebate. Persuade people\nwomen are only sexual\nobjects and you destroy\ntheir humanity, their right\nat, rape, nuke, or kill them\nwith no ethical qualms.\nEthics are extremely\nimportant. At this college\nstudents face ethical\ndecisions about South\nAfrica and apart hied, animal experimentation,\nnuclear weapons, women\nand sexism. These\ndecisions are forced upon\nthem by the nature of their\nstudies and their college.\nAt Imperial, it seems, all the\nrelevant moral and political\nissues of the day are not\njust theoretical, not just\nphilosopher's hot air, but\nare real. Yet if you listen to\nthe debates, the arguing,\nthe protests, what do you\nhear? Silence, interrupted\nmomentarily by the\nvomiting of arrogant, half-digested meals of 'fast\nfood' ideas. The microwaved 'Freedom' burger\nand 'its only a laugh' chips\nbeing a staple part of the\ndiet.\nIt is proudly proclaimed\nthat our college is non-political. It is seen to be a major part of a sabbatical's credibility that he/she\nrejects politics. But you\ncannot reject politics. All\nthat is rejected is the\npolitics of dissent, criticism,\nand protest, something that\nis not a mono ploy of the\nleft. This leaves Imperial\nwith the politics of apathy,\nac qui e sence and\ncondoning silence. This, by\nits nature, is not loudly\n'Michael Newman is a jerk'\nPeople are generally\nnice, when we study beside\nthem, chat to them, or\ndrink with them. These\nsituations, involving no\nstress or provocation, are\nused to defend the\nproposition that racism,\nsexism and prejudice are\nminimal at this college. We\nare like werewolves, with all\nthe appearance of\nhumanity and geniality, but\nin the full moon, or when\nlittle sis' brings 'big, black\nboy' home, we transform to\nthe raging monster. We\nrequire a reason to exhibit\nour prejudices, otherwise\nwe can'appear as nice as\nDr Jekyll.\nto say no. Persuade people\nMichael Newman is a jerk,\nyou destroy my humanity\nand no one will respect, or\ntry to understand what I say. Why listen to a jerk?\nIn politics and religion an\neffective way to deal with\nan opponent, is not to\nsilence them, but to\nencourage people to laugh\nat, ignore or hate them. All\nof these require an\nignorant, simplistic view of\nthe opponent, preferably a short, derogatory nickname with the required\nundertones.\nThis is most effective\nduring war, to motivate the\nsoldiers to kill their enemy,\nand their enemy's family.\nThe method of reducing a human being to an illusion,\nin the perceive r's mind, of\nsomething less than\nhuman, whether due to\ntheir colour, religion,\nnationality, behaviour,\nappear ace, sex, or beliefs,\nis what we call degradation.\nSomething less than human\nillicit es less respect than a person, they are seen to\nhave n6 HUMAN rights.\nYou can torture, gas, laugh\nspoken, yet it is just as\npolitical. It is seen at its\nstrongest in Orwell's'1984', or Huxley's 'Brave New\nWorld', or Nazi Germany.\nThis is the politics needed\nby the dictators of the Left\nand Right.\nMargaret Thatcher\ndislikes criticism and\ncomplaints, it irritates her.\nYou would have observed\nthis in her condescending\nremarks about the recent\nBirmingham riot. She likes\nImperial, it is a college of\napplication, of industry, not\nof philosophy or the arts.\nHer favourite businessman,\nClive Sinclair (Sir), lectures\nhere. Here her cabinet\nministers receive no\nprotests, she received a very small reception of less\nthan a hundred protesters,\nmostly from other colleges.\nNo rotten eggs are thrown.\nProtest, dissent, are\nminimal or absent.\nImperial College trains\ntechnicians and engineers,\nnot real scientists. Lord CP Snow thought scientists\nwere the freest of people,\nfree in terms of their work\nand free in terms of\nthought. HG Wells thought\nscientists were the saviours\nof the world. He slammed\nthis college, his college, for\nits failure to develop the\nfree-thinking minds science\nrequires. His criticisms of\nthe college, a hundred\nyears ago this year, ring\ntrue today.\nA fight that ultimately\noccurs in the mind of the\nsingle student, the\nindividual struggling\nagainst conformity and the\npower of ignorance.\nO We are the college fn at trains the bomb designers,\nthe engineers willing to\nwork under apart hied, or\nbuild gas chambers, the\ndesigners of bacterial and\nchemical warfare.\nTechnicians who see their\njob as to do the work\nrequired of them, without\nany uncomfortable\nquestions.\nImperial College is the\npolitics and science of a frightening future. A future\nof cold-blooded free\nmarket, of government\ncontrolled science, of the\nscience of control, public\ncontrol. A society of the\nsilent, self-interested.\nWhere there is no need to\nsuppress dissent because\nno one cares enough to do\nsomething, to criticise.\nWhere the official censor is\nreplaced by dusty shelves\nand waste-paper bins\ncollecting unwanted and\nunread books. Where\npeople become names, and\nnames are rubbed out.\nThe issues at stake are\nimportant ones, the debates\nlong lasting, and their\nconduct is as much an\nissue as those being\ndebated. The fight is for\nfreedom . The chains are\nthose that fetter f he mind.\nYou cannot see or feel\nthem, their nature is that\nyou are unlikely to believe\nthey are there. This fight is\none of thought, critical\ndoubt, discussion, seeking\nthe truth through scientific,\nmethod. It is the\napplication of our science.\nFELIX Friday 4 October 5\n\n"

    "content": "to Academic Affairs\nWith the Freshers' Week\nfestivities drawing to a close and lectures\nbeginning in earnest, now\nseems a good time to let\nyou know a little about the\nUnion's Academic Affairs\nactivities.\nAcademic Representatives\nMost importantly, next\nweek (or soon after) you\nwill have the opportunity to\nelect your own Academic\nReps. There are usually\ntwo for each year-group,\nand their task is to be the\nfirst line of representation\nbetween students in the\nlecture theatre and their\nlecturers. This involves\nmeeting with each lecturer\nto inform them of the\ngroup's feelings about\nhis/her course. If the\ncourse is utterly\nincomprehensible, the\nlecturing inaudible, or the\nproblem sheets illegible\nthen it's the Academic\nReps' job to gently point\nout to the lecturer where\nhe/she is going wrong and\nto suggest politely that they\nmight like to pull their\nsocks up.\nThe Acadmic Reps from\neach year and the\nDepartmental\nRepresentative together\nform the core of the\nstudent side of the StaffStudent Committee. As a group they should be able\nto deal with slightly wider\nissues, such as: should this\ncourse be taught at all?; is\nthe right material being\nincluded?; why don't we\nhave a course on...?; etc. It\nis essential that there is\nstudent input to the overall\ndesign of courses as\nchanges are made from\nyear to year.\nImportant-Sounding Names\nIf problems can't be\nresolved at departmental\nlevel, either because the\ndept is being unreasonable\nor the issue has an\ninterdepartmental aspect,\nthen the matter can be\ndealt with by the Academic\nAffairs Officer of the\nConstituent College Union\nor of IC Union. Between\nthem the four AAOs share\nthe task of making sure\nstudent opinion is taken\nnotice of at College\ncommittees with such\nimportant'Sounding names \u2022\nas Board of Studies,\nEngineering Board,\nUndergrad u ate/Postg rad-u ate Studies, Vacation\nTraining, etc. Things we\nare concerned with include\nsetting up new courses (or,\nmore usually nowdays, the\nscrapping of courses), the\ntype of degree each course\nleads to, what the College\nis doing to improve the\nstandards of teaching, etc. |\nTaboo Subject\nDid somebody mention\nteaching standards?\nUnfortunatly this sort of\nthing tends to get pushed\nunder the carpet at times of\nfinancial stringency.\nHowever, it may surprise\nyou to learn that whereas\nyour teachers at school\nwere trained in the skills of\nimparting knowledge, your\nlecturers were dumped in\nfront of their first lecture\ntheatre without any formal\ntraining at all. They will be\nan expert in their field, but\nput in front of a hundred\nexpectant students they\nmay well end up fumbling\ntheir way through even the\nbest prepared course,\ncausing students to\nbecome bored, confused\nand eventually\ndisillusioned. It is not\nusually, I hasten to add, for\nlack of caring about their\nteaching. A few are natural\nteachers, but most are not\nand would be improved\nwith even the most basic\nThe Academic Affairs Officer on his way to Board of Studies\ninstruction in teaching\nmethods. The Union has\nbeen in favour of this for\nyears, but without much\nsuccess.\nHow You Can Help\nThe most basic way you\ncan help your\nrepresentatives get results\nis to make sure they know\nyour opinions. Speak to\nthem personally and make\nsure they're doing their\njobs properly. At the end of\neach lecture course you\nwill be asked to fill in a question aire about the\ncourse and the lecturer.\nThe College produces lots\nof academic statistics such\nas A Level points and dropout rates. We aim to\ncompile figures showing\nthe causes for these\neffects, such as how many\nstudents are dissatisfied\nwith their lecturers or lab\nit MOT w re* T6wC\nWOW Tt>.... 4^\nSHMIHli - \u00bb If IT/\nwork. This depends on you\ngiving up a few minutes at\nthe end of each course.\nIf you've read this far you\nobviously have some\ninterest in Academic\nAffairs.

    "content": "Northey Hammered\nin Resignation Row\nUnion barmen Doug Armstrong\nand Brian Ellison resigned on\nWednesday in protest over\nrefectory manager Rob\nNorthey's attitude to their\nrunning of the Union bar.\nThey both handed in one\nmonth's notice following\ncomments made to Mr\nArmstrong by Mr Northey on\nTuesday afternoon. Later, just\nbefore the Union bar opened on\nWednesday evening, they were\nturned out by Mr Northey who\nthen took charge of the bar\nhimself.\nThere has been friction\nbetween Mr Northey and the\nUnion bar staff for some time.\nIn an interview with FELIX Mr\nArmstrong said that the new\nrefectory manager had shown\nno interest in the Union bar or\nthe students. His shock\nresignation came less than a week after Mr Northey\nintroduced his controversial\nprice rises, as reported in FELIX\non Monday.\nTrouble flared when Mr\nNorthey confronted Mr\nArmstrong over the Union Bar\ntakings for the New Year Party\non Monday. Mr Northey\nexpressed dissatisfaction with\nthe way the bar had been run\nand said that Mr Armstrong\nshould have had a third bar for\nthe party. Mr Armstrong told\nFELIX that such a bar had\nrarely proved profitable in the\npast. The bar takings for\nMonday were \u00a33374, a sum only\nbeen sur ps sed by a Guilds\nCarnival when there was an\nen tension till 3 am. Mr\nArmstrong felt that Mr Northey's comments were an insult to his\nability to run the Union bar, and\nseeing this as a vote of no\nconfidence from his employer,\nhe was compelled to resign.\nA hast led Rob Northey on\nWednesday night\nBrian Ellison and Doug Armstrong\nMr Northey received letters of\nresignation from Mr Armstrong\nand Mr Ellison on Wednesday\nmorning. He was contacted by\nFELIX at 4.00pm but declined to\ncomment on the resignations.\nHe said that he had learned the\nnews from College Secretary\nJohn Smith shortly before\nreceiving the letters, but did not\nknow enough about the\nsituation to comment further.\nUpon hearing that the barmen\nhad resigned, Union President\nCarl Burgess took the matter\ndirectly to John Smith. Mr\nSmith, it appears, fully\nsupported Mr Northey and felt it\nnatural that some staff should\nbe dissatisfied with a change of\nmanagement. Mr Burgess feels\nthat the Union barmen did the\nbest job possible on Monday.\nThis view was underlined by\nDeputy President Dave\nKingston who said that Mr\nArmstrong and Mr Ellison had\nworked from 10.00am till 3.00am on the day of the party.\nMr Burgess said that IC\nUnion should try to take over\nthe running of the Union bar\nand was hoping to persuade\nstudents to support a boycott of\nthe bars at Thursday's UGM.\nAt 5.45pm on Wednesday\nafternoon Mr Northey, together\nwith assistant refectory\nmanager Martin Parsons,\nentered the Union bar and\ninformed Mr Armstrong and Mr\nEllison that their services were\nno longer required. Bar staff\nin the Union bar\nregulars Chris Hendy, Pete\nHartley and Sean Davis\nimmediately left the bar. They\ntold FELIX that they would not\nbe prepared to work in the\nUnion bar following Mr\nNorthey's dismissal of the two\nbarmen.\nMr Armstrong said that Mr\nNorthey did not feel he could\nbe trusted to look after the bars\ntakings on one month's notice.\nHe expressed his apologies to\nRSM and RCS for any\ndisruption that might be caused\nto their bar nights, and regretted\nthat the incident had occured\nduring Freshers' week. He said\nthat Mr Northey spent all his\ntime looking after Southside bar\nand did not care about the\nUnion bar or about students. He\nstressed that running the Union\nbar was not like running any\nother bar. The Union, he said,\nhas its own traditions and\nneeded to have consistency,\nand added that he would like to\ndrink in the Union bar in future.\nMr Northey again declined to\nmake any statement yesterday\nevening. He said he would be\navailable for comment after\nmeeting with John Smith on\nThursday morning.\nThere were some ugly scenes\nin a packed union bar last night\nwhen students learned of the\ndismissal of Mr Armstrong and\nMr Ellison, a beer glass was\nthrown at the bar and several\ngroups of students shouted\nchants at Mr Northey.\nFree!

    "content": "3 ?\n\"O ft\nSL2\nOctfl>\nA1 Bars Boycott IC Union will be boycotting all\nCollege owned bars for a week\nstarting on Monday, as part of a campaign to give the Union\ncontrol of the Union Bar. All\nstudents have been requested\nto keep out of the bars during\nthe week.\nThe motion calling for the\nboycott was prompted by the\nresignation of Doug Armstrong\nand Brian Ellison (see front\npage). It noted dissatisfaction\nwith Mr Northey's management\nand called for IC Union to gain\ncontrol of the Union Bar.\nGareth Fish proposed the\nmotion saying that Mr Northey\nwas ripping students off by\novercharging. He also criticised\nMr Northey for sacking Mr\nArmstrong and Mr Ellison.\nSymon Corns attempted to\namend the motion so that\nstudents would only be\nrequested to boycott the Union\nBar. He said that the students\nwho drink in Southside would\nnot support the boycott.\nMr Fish replied saying that a boycott of the Union Bar only\nwould have no effect. The\namendment was defeated\nheavily.\nThe motion was then passed\nwithout opposition. Carl\nBurgess, IC Union President,\ninformed the UGM that he\nwould be organising publicity\nand pickets supporting the\nboycott.\nCollege Secretary, John\nSmith, told FELIX that strong\narm methods don't necessarily\nwork. He said that he didn't think a boycott was a very\nsensible way to start talking\nabout a bar takeover. He said\nthat he thought the Union didn't always appreciate the problems\nassociated with running the\nbars.\nMr Smith is believed to\nsupport Mr Northey's management style. He thinks\nthat Mr Northey is managing to\nsort out Victor Mooney's mistakes.\nUnion President, Carl\nBurgess, urged students to\nsupport the boycott. He said it\nwas vital for the boycott to\nsucceed if the Union are to gain\ncontrol of the Union bar.\nBurgess Ban\nRejected\nThe Rag Mag will be available\nfor sale as soon as the printer's name and address has been\nadded, it was decided at the\nUnion General Meeting\nyesterday.\nAddress labels are being\nstuck in the 2000 Rag Mags\nalready in the Union's possession and they are already\non sale. The remaining copies,\nstill at the printers, will now be\non sale as soon as the address\nis added and they are stapled.\nThe Mag had been withdrawn\nfrom circulation by the Exec\nwho decided that it contained\njokes unfit for publication, and\nthat it was probably illegal\nbecause the printer had\nremoved his address from the\nartwork.\nUnion President Carl Burgess\npro prose da motion calling for\nfuture Rag Mags to be\ninspected by a Censorship\nCommittee, and for the\noffending pages of this year's Mag to be reprinted in an\nacceptable form. Rag Chairman\nJon Ingham put forward an\namendment allowing the Mag to\nbe put on sale in its present\nform as soon as the printers's address was added, whilst still\nallowing for a Censorship\nCommittee to be formed for\nnext year's Rag Mag. A further\namendment, proposed by J Martin Taylor, censured the\nPresident for failing to properly\ncheck the artwork before\nprinting, as he is required to do\nunder existing Council policy.\nBoth amendments were\nconvincingly carried.\nSpeaking to his motion Mr\nBurgess said he believed the\ncontents of the Mag to be\ndetrimental to Imperial\nCollege's image. We had to\nconsider the feelings of other\npeople, he said. When\nquestioned why he had\nproduced a similar Rag Mag\nhimself two years ago he said\nhe now realised that he had\nbeen wrong to do this and he\nregretted having done it.\nProposing the first\namendment, Mr Ingham\nrejected the argument that the\nCollege's image was damaged\nby the Rag Mag. Visiting other\ncolleges he found that most\nstudents thought IC Rag Mags\nwere 'great'. The extra cost of\nreprinting parts of the Rag Mag\nwould mean less money for\ncharity.\nCity and Guilds Union\nPresident, Roger Preece,\nopposed the amendment. He\ngave examples of some of the\njokes he objected to. Once the\nCollege had a bad reputation\nfor producing sick humour it\nwould be hard to lose. However,\non the vote the amendment was\ncarried by a clear majority.\nE iii o[ia FELIX editorials have\ncriticised the Rag Mag.\nThis week's editorial\ncriticises the bar motion. It\nis now Union policy that\nwe can sell the Rag Mag. It\nis now Union policy that\nwe don't drink in the bars.\nDON'T drink in the bars. It\nis important that this policy\nsucceeds. The Union\nshould have control of the\nbars. SELL Rag Mags.\nEnsure that we make as\nmuch as we can for\ncharity.\nBoycott the Bars\nDrink at the Norfolk\n\n"

    "content": "motion at the next day's UGM that, if passed, would\nresult in the Union\norganising a boycott of all\nCollege bars until the\nUnion took control of the\nUnion Bar. He seems to\nhave spend about half an\nhour thinking about the\nmotion. He thinks that\nstudents will boycott\nSouthside as well as the\nUnion. Most students who\ndrink in Southside don't care about the Union Bar.\nThey like a quiet, cheap\nevening in hall. The\nstudents who drink in\nSouthside are, in general,\nnot hacks. They don't care\nabout U GM decisions. On\nMonday morning the Union\nBar will have little stock\nbecause Carnival will run\nthe stocks low. It will have\nno staff bacause Brian and\nDoug have gone. A boycott\nmay well give Rob Northey\nthe excuse he needs to\nclose the Union Bar. In\nother words we could end\nwith the Union Bar closed\nand Southside still trading\nsuccessfully. The only\npeople hurt will be the\nUnion hacks who regularly\ndrink in the Union. By the\ntime you read this the U GM may well have decided to\nsupport the boycott. If it\nhas, I hope the boycott\nworks.

    "content": "Despite the disadvantages of the present\nTory Government, it is still possible to\nclaim quite a lot of money from either the\ntaxman or the DHSS. Here, in the first\nof a series of welfare articles, IC Welfare\nOfficer Lesley Gillingham explains what\nyou're entitled to and how to claim it...\nTypes Of Benefit And How To\nClaim\n1. Certificated Housing Benefit\nand Housing Supplement\nThese benefits are only\navailable to those able to 'sign\non' as unemployed and\navailable for work in the area in\nwhich they are paying rent.\nThese benefits are not\napplicable for full-time students\nin term time but they are\ncertainly the quickest way of\ngetting the highest amount of\nyour housing costs back over\nthe vacations. To claim, 'sign\non' at your local Unemployment Benefit Office (UBO) on\nthe first weekday of the\nvacation. If you are not eligible\nfor unemployment benefit your\nforms are automatically passed\non to the local Supplementary\nBenefit Office (DHSS). The\nDHSS will assess your claim\nand will inform you in writing\nof their decision.\nEntitlement to supplementary benefit carries with it\nentitlement to Certificated\nHousing Benefit.\nThe DHSS will send a 'certificate' on your behalf to\nthe local housing authority\nauthor ising them to pay your\nhousing costs. In theory claims\nshould be resolved within\nfourteen days (in practice they\nrarely are) and can provide up\nHOUSING BENEFIT\n-and how to claim it\u2014\nto a100% rebate of your rent\nand rates.\nIf you are not eligible for\nsupplementary benefit the\nDHSS will send you a form for\nStandard Housing Benefit.\n2. Standard Housing Benefit\nDesigned to help those on a low\nincome (including students)\nwith their housing costs. Under\nthe current regulations students\nliving in IC owned acc-om mod ation, ie Halls or\nHouses (but not Head\nTenancies), are not eligible for a rate rebate. Claim by sending a claim form to the appropriate\nHousing Authority. Student\nServices keep a selection of\nforms and can help you work\nout which authority you should\nsend your claim to. When you\nsubmit the claim form you\nshould also enclose:\na) proof of rent paid\nb) proof of income ie grant\nassessment form,\nc)a recent bank state me mt and\nproof of any savings,\nd)a copy of the term dates.\nClaims cannot be back-dated, they start from the day\nthe local authority Housing\nBenefit Office receives the claim\nform. So don't delay it could\ncost you money. If you do not\nhave all the documents at hand\nsend in the form and state that\nadditional information is on its\nway.\nAll London Benefit Offices\nexpect students to inform them\nat the begining of the vacation\nthat they require their benefit\nrate to be reassessed due to a change in circumstances ie\nincome is less. This only applies\nif you are not 'signing on' for\nthis period.\nHow to Calculate your\nStandard Housing Benefit\n1. Work out your 'Needs\nAllowance':\nSingle Person \u00a345.10\nCouple \u00a366.50\nEach dependent\nchild \u00a313.85\n2. Work out your gross weekly\nThe undergraduate student\ngrant works out as \u00a364.83pw during term time, of which\n\u00a320.80pw is disregarded for rent\n(but not for rates) purposes,\nleaving \u00a344.03.\nThe vacation element in the\ngrant is \u00a327.50 (not the summer\nvacation) and no disregard is\nmade on this figure.\n3. Work out your weekly rent\nand rates:\nIf your rent includes any\namounts for gas or electricity\npayments, money will be\ndeducted from your rent for\nthese. Maximum deductions\nare:\nheating\u2014\u00a36.25,\ncooking\u2014\u00a30.75,\nhot water\u2014\u00a30.75,\nlighting\u2014\u00a30.50.\nYour rent will then be divided\ninto rent and rates. Rates are\nusually taken to be 30/35% of\nyour total rent. During\nterm time students on a grant\nmust deduct \u00a320.20 per week\nfrom their remaining weekly\nrent to get their 'eligible' weekly\nrent figure. No deduction is\nmade in the vacation.\n4. Calculate your rebate/\nallowance:\na) If your income equals the\nNeeds Allowance figure:\nRebate/allowance = 60%\neligible weekly rent and 60%\nweekly rates.\nb) If your income is less than the\nNeeds Allowance figure:\nRates = 60% weekly rates plus\n8% of the difference between\nincome and the Needs\nAllowance figure.\nRents = 60% eligible weekly\nrent plus 25% of the difference\nbetween income and the Needs\nAllowance figures:\nc) If your income is more than\nthe Needs Allowance figures:\nRates = 60% weekly rates minus\n9% of the difference between\nincome and the Needs\nAllowance figure.\nRent = 60% eligible weekly rent\nminus 26% of the difference\nbetween income and the Needs\nAllowance figure.\nNB The \u00a320.80 pw disregard of\nincome mentioned in 2 above\napplies only to the calculation\nof rent rebate/allowance. For\nrate rebates your income is\ntaken as the full \u00a364.83 pw.\nDon't forget\nRemember if you have any\nquestions or experience difficulties with housing benefit,\nStudent Services will be able to\nhelp you\nIc3 If your parents contribute to\nyour grant, you can use a covenant as a way of increasing\nthe money that they give you by\n43%.\nConvenants were developed\nas a means of aiding tax-exempt\ncharities but there is no reason\nwhy they shouldn't be used by\ntax-exempt people of which\nimpoverished students are a classic example.\nHow covenants work: Your\nparents commit themselves in\nwriting to an undertaking to\npay a certain sum of money\neach year for a period capable\nof exceeding six years. This does\nnot commit your parents to\nactually paying you for six\nyears, it is merely a legal\nrequirement of covenants that\nthey must be capable of\nexceeding six years. After each\npayment you get a form from\nthe tax office, fill it in, return it\nto your tax office who will then\nrefund you the basic rate of tax\nthat your parents have already\npaid on the money that you\nreceive under the covenant.\nHow to Draw up a Deed of\nCovenant\nThe Consumer Assocation has\ndevised a form of deed which\nthe tax man should accept and\nthey have given permission for\nits reproduction here.\nCovenants a free gift\nfrom the taxman\nHow to make a deed of covenant\nI, Ed Smith, of 16 Moon Street, Blackburn, covenant to\nmy son/d aut gh ter, Jo Smith, of the same address, a gross\namount of \u00a3116.67 on each of the seven years, or for the\nperiod of our joint lives, or until he/she ceases to be\nreceiving full-time education at any university, college,\nschool or other educational establishment (whichever is\nthe shortest period), the first payment to be made on 1st October 1985.\nDate 1 September 1985 Signed, sealed and delivered by\nEdward Smith:\nin the presence of\nIt is advisable to follow this\nexample exactly, substituting\nthe appropriate names,\naddresses, amounts and dates\nof payments.\nPoints To Watch Out For:\n1. You can't benefit from a covenant from your parents if\nyou are under eighteen or\nmarried.\n2. Your parents must be\ntaxpayers and you a non-taxpayer.\n3. The installments can be paid\nat whatever intervals you like\nbut the first one must be after\nthe date on which the covenant\nis signed. If you intend to claim\nany benefits during the\nvacations it may be worth using\nthe suggested payment dates\nused in the example covenant\nsince these are designed to\ncorrespond roughly with the\nstarting dates of each term and\nshould prevent the DHSS\ntrying to count covenanted\nincome as vacation income.\n4 Amount\u2014this can be stated\neither as 'a gross amount of \u00a3x' as in the example which means\nthat your parents deduct the\ntax, which you will get back,\nfrom the total contribution and\npay you the rest. This means\nthat they have to alter the\namount that they actually give\nyou every time the basic rate of\ntax changes. So if the parental\ncontribution is \u00a3100 and tax is\n30%, they would hand over \u00a370\nand you would get the other \u00a330\nfrom the tax man. If the basic\nrate then went down to 25%,\nthey would have to pay you \u00a375.\nThe other way of doing it is to\nagree to pay 'an amount, which\nafter deduction of tax at the\nbasic rate, amounts to \u00a3x'. This\nmeans that they pay the same\namount all the time, but the\nrefund from the tax man will\nvary with changes in the basic\nrate. This second variety is the\nmost common.\n5. The formalities\u2014you can\ncopy out the covenant with\nalterations and it doesn't really\nmatter how you do this. The\nimportant thing is that it must\nbe signed by whoever is paying\nand witnessed by someone\nother than yourself. It might be\nadvisable if the witness is not\nyour other parent but that\nprobably does not really\nmatter. However, since you\ndon't know whether the tax\nman will query it until the end\nof the tax year when, in a sense,\nit is too late, it is better to play\nsafe. The other important thing\nto remember is that THE DEED MUST BE SEALED. You can do this with sealing\nwax or a disc of red paper which\nyou stick onto the deed. Your\nparents should then hand the\ndeed over to you.\n6. Covenants can be drawn up\nat any time of the year and at\nany point in the student's course, but for maximum\nbenefit, the sooner the better.\n7. The covenant can be\ncancelled by mutual consent at\nany time. Consequently if the\namount of parental contribution alters drastically due to a change of circumstances, the\noriginal covenant can be\ncancelled and a new one made\nout with the revised figures.\nHowever, there is a theory that\ntoo many cancellations may\nlead the tax man to question\nwhether the covenants were\never intended to last the full\nperiod.\nOther Earnings\nThe amount covenanted\u2014ie\nwhat you get from your parents\nplus what your get from the tax\nman\u2014counts as your earned\nincome. This means that if the\nmoney you receive under the\ncovenant, plus any other\nincome you have during the\nyear such as vacation earnings,\nplus any supplementary/un-employment benefit (but not\nhousing benefit), exceeds your\npersonal tax allowance (\u00a32200\nfor a single person), then you\nwill have to start paying tax on\nthe excess.\nClaiming the Money back\nWhen your parents hand over\nthe covenant to you, send a copy to your tax office. If you\nhaven't got a tax office look in\nthe telephone book under\nInland Revenue and contact the\nnearest to where you live. They\nwill send you a tax form to\ncomplete and instructions\nabout re-claiming your money.\nFor each claim, your parents\nwill need to complete form\nR185(AP), available from the |\ntax office, which is returned to\nyour tax office who will then\nmake the refund.\nIf you want any more details or(\nhave any questions on this,\nplease call. into the Student\nServices Office.\n8 Friday 4 October9 "
