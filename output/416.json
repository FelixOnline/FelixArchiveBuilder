    "content": "MU X Theatre\n\" The Chairman\" by Philip Mackie\nGlobe Theatre\nTom Stevenson\nTHERE ARE certain plays on the West\nEnd stage at the moment which shouldn't be there, and this is one of them. That\nwas my first reaction to this piece. It's perfect for a two part television play\nbut it just doesn't work on a live stage.\nIf I were required to put it into a tidy\nslot I would call it an Office Comedy\nwith added ethics.\nHaving pondered this for a little\nwhile I see that my first ideas were\nquite wrong. If our aim is to get more\npeople to go to the live theatre, for the\nfirst time, and I quite sincerely believe\nthat a great number of people who have\nnever seen professional live acting are\nmissing an awful lot, then this must\nbe the right sort of thing, and it is for\nthis reason that I can identify it so closely with the sort of television\noutput we see on our screens week after\nIC Dramatic Society's Production of\nTwo Gentlemen of Verona\nby William Shakespeare\nDirected by Mark Frank\nTHE PLAY is one of Shakespeares\nearlier ones, and one of his less well\nknown. The plot is simple \u2014 one young\nman (Proteus) fancies his friend's( Valentine) girlfriend, and nearly succeeds in winning her.\nThe stage props are a challenge to\nanyone attempting this production as\nthe action passes from street to house\nto forest to abbey, and this problem was ingeniously overcome by using an\nabstract back cloth which was modified\nbetween scenes. The normal stage was a bondone d in favour of a( perhaps\nmore traditional) open one, placed\nsideways in the concert hall, and with\nno curtains or other barriers between\nactors and audience. Altogether, it\nweek.\nSet in the public relations office of\na large manufacturing organisation,\n\"The Chairman\"depicts the manipulation\nof the members of the department by\ntheir director. The first act contains\nall the old routines of farewell parties\nfor loyal employees, welcome to new\nexecutives and the visit of the dreaded\nbusiness efficiency expert. The latter\nappears after the director has conveniently found an excuse to head for\nNew York, and his maniacal deputy is\nleft to hold the fort. The underlings all confess the pointlessness of their jobs\nwhilst the deputy proves to be the\nodd-man-out with his conviction that he\nis in d is pensi ble. The director returns\nat the critical moment to restore\neveryone's confidence by pointing out\nthat without the public relations department the mysterious bogey man, \"The\nChairman' , would be shown up to be\nthe cardboard figure he really is; he\nthen goes on to manoeuvre his subordinates into fresh posts without\nanyone realising and we are surprised\nto see how- easy it is. Tony Britton plays the director with\nthe suavity we would expect from any\nappeared the director's intention to\nbring about a close rapport between\nactors and audience, and this was only marred by the stage hands who walked boldly onto the stage between\nscenes as if they were part of the\nplay. The simple expedient of dimming\nthe lights between scenes could have\ndone much to maintain the atmosphere.\nThe acting was at times, quite\nimpressive: especial points of note were\nIan Morrison's very lifelike portrayal of\nthe periods when Proteus was at his most sly and devious, and the comic\ninterplay between servants La unc e( Eric Stovell) and Speed. (Chris Wells).\nBoth these parts of the play must come\nacross if the play is to be a success \u2014\nthe first part because the whole plot\ndepends on the credibility of Proteus, while the second is a light hearted\nbreak for the audience without which\nthe play would become too heavy.\nThe boldness of Valentine (Richard\nSmith), the thorough idiocy of Thurio\nself-respecting PR man. The real tour\nde force comes from Peter Blythe as the deputy who can seldom manage to\nend one sentence before lunging into\nthe next. Although his performance\nstarted out a bit joo self-indulgently\nhe was soon into his stride with a laugh which should have driven his colleagues out of the office in five\nminutes.\nWhether this is a vehicle for Mr\nMackie' s dissatisfaction with the ethics\nof public relations or a comedy pure\nand simple can be decided by the\naudience, but I suspect that the latter\nwill win the day and the former will sink without trace. I must confess that\nI did enjoy myself.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 * *\nI hope to be reporting fully next\nterm on the National Student Drama\nFestival. This takes place in Edinburgh\nfrom the 2nd to 11th of April. Ten Universities and Colleges will be\nrepresented by productions ranging from\nChekhov, through Beckett and Orton to\nseveral new plays by student writers.\nDiscussions will be led by Joan Bake well Jonathan Hales, J W Lambert, Charles Marowitz, EA Whitehead and many others.\n(Roger Philips), the emotion of Julia( Pam Sell ars), the perception of Sylvia( Helen Lawson), were, overall, success fully transmitted to the audience, as was the lack of acting talent of\nLasince's dog.\nThe difficulties that the cast had\nin making sure that the play's pace was kept such that the witty lines appeared\nfast without leaving the audience behind\nwere apparent at certain times. Whereas\nall the most important scenes were\ntimed very well, I was made very\napprehensive at the start by some loss in the clarity of production. The same\nhappened at the end, but this may be\nblamed on Shakespeare's sudden \" and they all lived happily ever after\"\nending.\nI felt a little disappointed at the\nprogramme which I paid for, and no\ndoubt at least one of the actresses is somewhat peeved at the unhelpful\ncast list ordering.\nBill Gerrard\nOpera\nKing Roger by Szymanowski (English\nNational Opera at the London Coliseum\nMarch 2 2 , April 1 and 9',\nIT WAS more thought-provoking than\npurely pleasure able to see a rare\nperformance of this Polish opera dating\nfrom 1926.\nKing Roger ruled in Sicily in the\n12th century and this opera concerns\nhis transformation from a man of the\nintellect alone to one who acknowledges\nthe equal claims of beauty, sensuality\nand freedom, personified, or one should\nsay deified, by Dionysos who appears\nto the King and his Court in the form\nof a shepherd proclaiming a new\nreligion. When persuaded by the ecclesiastics to banish the shepherd for\nheresy, the King loses all his courtiers\nto the land of freedom and delight\nand so finally decides to cast off the\nattributes of royalty and, wearing only\na loincloth, offers up a hymn to the\nsun on the altar of a ruined Greek\ntheatre where his search for the shepherd\nhas led him.\nSzymanowki is a name probably\nunfamiliar and daunting to most, but I found his mg sic reminded me most of\nDebussy with an additional smattering\nof Richard Strauss to represent the\nsensuousness of Dionysos. In many\nways the opera is similar to Debussy' s Pel leas et Melisande sharing with it\na lack of obvious dynamic variation so that the final act seemed to stop rather\nthan build to a climax. Unfortunately it\nlacked Debussy' s subtlety so that the\nmore dramatic points in the narrative\nwere emphasised in the music with\nsudden, loud d is chords of brass and\npercussion made all the more histrionic\nby their' contrast with the surrounding\nrepose.\nThe English National Opera matched\nthe music with a staging that used little\nmovement and so the combined effect\nwas rather staid. This was not helped\nby the use of a huge gauze for the\nfinal act which covered the entire\nproscenium arch and, lit from behind,\nprovided a transparent wall between\nsingers and audience. I found the\neffect most disconcerting and it seemed\nextreme for the few visual effects which\nit allowed.\nOne's parting doubts were not\neased by a self-indulgent succession of curtain calls to the sound of rapidly\ndiminishing applause from a full first-night house. Er jc stowe,| Cinema\n\" Farewell, My Lovely\"( Fox-Rank,\nA A). Directed by Dick Richard;\nstarring Robert Mitchum, Charlotte\nRampling, Sylvia Miles'.\nI have never really thought of\nCharlott Rampling as a sex-symbol, but\nif she keeps crossing and un crossing her legs as she does in this film then\nmy opinion could undergo rapid change.\nHowever, her performance was not very\nconvincing and acting credits here must\ngo to Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe\nand Sylvia Miles as the alcoholic Mrs Florian. She could teach some\npeople in this College a thing or two\nabout drinking!\ncontinued on page 7\n\n"

    "content": "MU X5 IC Radio-the why's and wherefore's\" WHAT ARE those strange sounds we\nhear on Tueaday lunchtime\"? you may\nwonder to yourself. You might also inquire as to who is behind it and\neven further, is it really necessary?\nFirstly, the noises on Tuesday\nlun c times are made by Imperial\nCollege Radio. The idea of a radio\nstation on campus was conceived\nabout two years ago and has been\nsnowballing ever since. Up till recently\n(see FELIX No 414) the lack of a test licence had been prohibiting\nprogress. In order not to lose enthusiastic\nmembers, they searched for something\nto do that was vaguely connected with\ntheir ultimate goal. The college public\naddress systems were the obvious\ntarget and that is why you \" listen\" to\nImperial College\" Radio\" on Tuesday.\nSecondly, the question of necessity. The answer is quite simply, debatable.\nThey obviously think so, as do the\nUnion and the College. The way IC\nRadio look at it, they are attempting to\nprovide a service to the IC community\nwithin the immediate vicinity of College in an entirely new way. IC Radio\nproduces news and \" what' son\" bulletins which include national and\nstudent news, and intersperse them\nwith good music and witty;?) comments\nfrom DJ's. So far, the music policy has been\nleft entirely to the individual disc jockey, which means that certain\ntypes of music are left untouched. This is evidenced by the obvious lack of\nsoul and reggae music in the music\nput out. However, they have yet to\nreceive complaints.\nAt present, the programmes can be\nheard, at various times, in the J CR, the\nButtery and the refectory in the Sherfield\nBuilding. They have had to end transmissions to the Main Refectory because\nof the bad sound quality. At one time\nthey tried to produce programmes which\ncould be heard in the Union and Southside\nrefectories, both of which possess good\nacoustic properties.\nHere they hit more snags; there\nwere no facilities for live programme\nproduction at either location. This meant that the programmes had to be\npre-recorded, but this was a time-consuming method and the idea was\nfinally a bondone d. They are at the\nmoment talking about laying cables\nfrom the IC Radio room to the Union and\nto the Sherfield Building. This would\nthen enable them to put out live broad-casts to these places and reach a bigger audience.\nOne of the main driving forces (and\ngeneral PR man) behind IC Radio is\nJohn Allen, a Management Science PG. He was also one of the pioneers of\nthe scheme and has been instrumental\nin the progress so far achieved. Those\nof you who \" listen\" to IC Radio will know him as the \"Moody Blues Freak\". The other station managers are Steve\nBarron and Paul May who is responsible\nfor the \" jingles\". Another prominent member of IC\nRadio is its News Editor, Nigel Miller.\nHe does a remarkable job sifting\nthrough newspapers, finding relevant\nand topical news stories for his bulletins.\nIan Cairns is their Promotions officer,\nalthough he is rarely seen about the\nplace. He collects and collates the\nmasses of advertising material sent to\nhim by College societies. Another\ngrafter is Dave Chance, the Secretary.\nHe is the paper-work man - a symptom\nof a bureaucratic Union. Behind the scenes are three stalwarts\nknown as Technical Managers. They\nare John Comfort, Mike Elgey and Tim\nShelton. They run everything on the\ntechnical side.\nNow that they have received the\ntest licence they are faced with a manpower problem for next year. This is because many of their present members\nare third year students so if you want to\ntry your hand at disc jockeying, interview\nor can help technically, get in touch with\nJohn Allen or Steve Barron - they will be glad to hear from you.\nWhose BOSS? South Africa\n-the London connection\nTHE LIBERAL PARTY has been rocked\nby s can del in recent weeks and South\nAfrican companies have been named\nas financing the \" framing\" of prominent\nofficials. However, the full range of\nSouth African activities abroad ranges\nfrom slander to espionage. Incredible\nas it may seem, this murky, sub-James\nBond world is nearer than you think ...\nOn Friday 20th February, the lodgings\nof an IC student in Tufnell Park, North\nLondon were broken into. His landlord\nis the chief representative in Western\nEurope of the African National Congress\nof South Africa. Several valuable\nitems were stolen, but the thief had\nalso shown a peculiar interest in\ndocuments and files; opening several\nletters during his stay. It was as if\nhe was looking for something.\nSouth Africa has recently been under\na great deal of pressure from all sides\nand not surprisingly, appears to be\nprotecting its interests by an active,\nif secret, participation in the affairs\nof other countries. The English speaking world, and in particular, Britain, seems\nto be the main sphere of activity outside\nSouthern Africa. Involvement seems to be split into\ntwo types; the first to enhance the\nimage of South Africa and cultivate\nfriends, the second, and perhaps more\nsinister traditional espionage concerning\ndissident groups operating inside and\noutside their country ( ANC, etc).\nThe goings-on in the Liberal Party\nwere attributed by Harold Wilson to\nSouth African companies operating in\nBritain. He denied the influence of the\nSouth African government, but there\ncan be little doubt that BOSS, the S A Bureau of State Security was implicated.\nBesides the \" framing\" of Peter Hain\nand Jeremy Thorpe, anonymous letters\nhave been sent to the MP, Cyril Smith\nand his mother. Rumours have also been\ncirculated concerning the involvement of\nClement Freud's daughter in a pornographic film.\nWhy might the South African government\nwish to destroy the reputation of the\nLiberals? Purely for revenge, as they\nhave been amongst the most outspoken\nand bitter critics of apartheid in the\npast? Or, as Peter Hain thinks, to elect\na Conservative government which would\nlook more favourably on them than\nLabour?\nA more obvious way of promoting\nSouth Africa can be seen in one-page\nadvertisements in the national press,\nin Holland, two newsreader s were\nsacked for changing the text of news\nbulletins. The reports, which were\nbroadcast to South Africa in Afrikaans\nbecame more favourable to apartheid\nafter being translated from Dutch.\nThe other side of BOSS is no less\nactive. There have been numerous\nbreak-ins attributed to security agents.\nAnother member of the ANC was robbed\nwhile he was out of the country;\nseveral documents were taken, and the\nthe if left \u00a380 in cash in an opened\ndrawer.\nMr James Wellbeloved, Labour MP, delivered last week to the Prime\nMinister's office a dossier of over\ntwenty such cases of suspected South\nAfrican involvement in Britain. He\nbelieves that recent burglaries of the\nPrime Minister and three of his staff\nshow simi lar features.\nAn ugly consequence of these\nrobberies can be seen in the case of\nPeter Moumbaris. In 1972, a fair-headed\nyoung man approached Mr Moumbaris'\nmother in London, with a forged letter\nasking for the key to his flat. She\ngave it to him and at Moumbaris' trial\nin South Africa, documents were produced\nin evidence which could only have\ncome from that London flat.\nPrime Minister Vorster, of South\nAfrica dismisses these allegations as\n\" absolute rubbish\", but stolen documents\nwere also produced at the trial of the\nDean of Johannesburg.\nIt is unlikely that BOSS is involved\nin all that it's name has been linked\nwith. As the head of BOSS says,\" I would not be surprised to learn my bureau\nwas being held responsible for the\ndeath of a Persian cat in a London\nstreet.\" All the evidence points, though, to\nan unhealthy and illegal interest in our\ndomestic politics, which prompts the\nquestion, in Britain, \" Who' s Boss?\" WANTED\nFELIX\nSTAFF!!\n\n"

In addition,\nthey have perpetrated acts that can only be described as\nde liq nen t. It is no snip rise that the Club has dissociated itself\nfrom the activities of its five members; however, the club\nofficials cannot totally be absolved of all responsibility.\nAs organisers, it is their duty to ensure that Union rooms\nbooked in the Club's name are left in a reasonable condition.\nThis clearly was not done.\nThe rise and . . . .\nTHE IMMINENT demise of Sennet has created quite a fur ore in UL U, especially amongst smaller colleges which\ndepend on it for news of events happening in the London\nstudent area. This is not the first (and probably will not\nbe the last) time that Sennet has faced doom. As before,\nthe problem is one of money.\nFinancial crisis finally jumped into Sennet's path when\ntheir advertising revenue began to drop. To date, Sennet\nhas accrued a loss of \u00a31500; this is expected to be \u00a33000\nby the end of next term. UL U have \u00a322,000 to spend on its\n78 clubs and societies this year \u2014 the dent, UL U feels,\nthat Sennet's debt would make is rather large.\nHowever, they have been given a chance to stay alive \u2014\nif they obtain enough advertising revenue to cover costs\nthen Sennet will appear that week. It is a sensible decision\nby UL U, especially when there is a strong feeling that the\nstandard of the paper has gone down drastically this year.\nRefectories\nIT IS ENCOURAGING to see that the criticisms levelled\nat the Catering Service have yielded positive results.\nWithout doubt, the food served in the refectories has\nimproved, especially in the Union \u2014 witness the increased\nnumber of students eating there.\nThe hard work that the Catering staff have put in is a credit to them.

BREMSSTRAHLUN6\nPakistan Society\nSOME OF YOU may wonder\nwhat the role of the Pakistan\nSociety is within IC? The\nsimple answer is that one of\nits purposes is to acquaint\nyou with the Art and Culture\nof Pakistan, and to convey to\nyou, through this media, the\nmessage of Peace and self-respect for which we and\nour culture stand.\nThe Pakistan Society is\nan organisation of students\nfrom Pakistan and those\ninterested in it. Our aim is\ntwo-fold; firstly, we endeavour\nto provide Pakistani students\nat IC with a forum for meeting\neach other and getting to\nknow this country. Secondly,\nwe try to arrange functions,\nfilm-shows, lectures, etc., to introduce Pakistan and\nits ideology to the students\npf Imperial College. To these ends, we arranged\na film show, a musical evening\ncelebrating Eid festival( the\nMuslims equivalent of\nChristmas) and our most\nadventurous event to date, a musical variety programme\nwhich featured Mohammad\nK assam. The film show, staged in\nconjunction with the Islamic\nSociety in order to reduce\ncosts, consisted of six films. These introduced Islam,\nPakistan and the Arab struggle\nfor the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.\nThe musical variety\nprogramme was very colourful\nand attracted an audience of\nabout 1000 people. 'Parvartee',\na young, beautiful singer and\ndancer, was probably one\nof the main reasons for the\nlarge crowds.\nRecordings of the show\nwere put out by BBC Radio\nLondon on its programme for\nAsian listeners.\nWe also held a rag collection at the end of the show and\ncollected about \u00a324. This idea, I believe, could be\npursued by other societies. However little such a collection might be, it would be an\nadditional contribution to\nRAG. I would also like to suggest\nthat all societies should\nlook into the possibilities of staging functions jointly -this would help to minimise costs providing there is no\nclash of interests.\nFinally, I would like to\nextend my thanks to the\nExecutive Committee and\nmembers of the Society who\nhelped to make the programmes\na success.

Other damage done last\nThursday night included the\nsmashing of all the coffee\ncups used at the dinner, and the breakage of two chairs in the Lower Lounge. The clock in the Union Dining\nHall was also smashed.\nAdditional minor damage was later reported.\nTrust Fund\nAwards\nSTUDENTS wishing to\nfollow activities of special\ninterest during the coming\nsummer holidays have recently\nhad a boon thrown their way.\nThe Committee of Management of the Convocation\nTrust Fund has launched a scheme aimed at providing\nfinancial assistance, in the\nform of grants, to a few of\nthese students. The grants\nwill be up to \u00a3150 and initially will be available to\na maximum of only five\nproposals.\nAlthough a project does\nnot have to be related to\nthe course of study for which\na student is registered, it\nmust have educational value\nand benefit the student to\nqualify for consideration\nunder the scheme.\nIf the scheme succeeds, then the Committee of Management will consider\ninstituting a more permanent\narrangement. Applications for\na grant have to be made on a special form, obtainable from:\nThe Clerk of Convocation,\nUniversity of London, Senate\nHouse, Room 101 A, Malet\nStreet, London WOE7 HU. Floor Reps abolished\nAt last Monday's Council, the Floor Reps Committee was\nofficially abolished. As of\nnext year the six representatives of the Union floor\nwills it on a new body,\nprovisionally named ' The ICU Permanent Working\nParty'. This will have specific topics referred to it by\nUG Ms, Council or the\nExecutive, for detailed\ninvestigation. It will report\nback at the next Council or\nU GM. The reason behind the change is to give the six Floor Reps more definite\nterms of reference and\ninvolve them more closely with\nthe Union as a whole.\nNext year's Floor Reps are due to be elected next\nterm (nomination papers are\nalready up). Anyone standing\nis advised to contact Martin\nKessler( Int 4463 or \u2022 IC Union Office) who can give\nthem a more detailed picture\nof what the new Floor Rep job entails.\nScholarships\nThe College has recently\npublished its list of scholarship awards for 1976. In all,35 scholarships have been\nawarded to students from\nall over the world. However,\nthe bulk of recipients are\nhome students.\nOne Cloth workers' scholar-ship, ten Royal scholarships\nand 24 Entrance scholarships\nwere awarded, with the\nMathematics department receiving a total of six scholarships, the highest of any department.\nJill Laithwaite at the Well HOC lecture last Mondaystory page 3.'\n\n"

And All Was Light - Pope\nReporter: Well Sir, what do\nyou think of this guy Laith wat e? Do you think that his lecture and demonstration was just a box of tricks covered\nthinly by a facade of impressive\nformulae and half truths? A clever fraud?\nHGW: Young man, I think you\nmiss the point. The Professor\nundoubtedly knows what he\ncan do and is able to do but\nalso, as he said, he is often\nunable to explain how he\nperforms his\" tricks\". What\nis more important I feel, is\nthat he forces us to question\nwhat we know and accept as true. We blindly acknowledge\nmany so called facts and\nlaws, without question, as the indisputable truth. Professor Laithwaite shows us'\nthe paradoxes inherent in\nmany of the laws and truths.of\nPhysics. I think that he may\nbe capable of destroying not\nonly the complacency of\nphysicists but also the\na qui e sence of other scientists to the dogma that everything\ncan be described ultimately\nin terms of Physics. Reporter: Do you think that\nhe is undermining the\nfoundations of science? I mean, to understand phenomena\nwe must describe them ip\nspecified terms. Is it not\ndestructive and indeed\nridiculous to call a magnetic\nfield \"nothing described in a rather elaborate way\". HGW:' That I cannot say. He is undoubtedly risking a great\ndeal of scientific respectability in presenting his theories in such a popular\nway. In a similar way science fiction is treated with contempt as fanciful and flippant\ndreaming, yet there is often\nan underlying basis of truth.\nScience is not always dry,\nhumour less and serious yet\nit breeds so many serious and\nhumour less scientists. Reporter: Do you agree that\nthere is a difference between\ndoing and knowing how?\nHGW: Yes I do. In this lies\nthe difference between\ntechnology and science. There\nshould be no dichotomy. There\nshould be hybrids of theoretical\nscientists and practical\ntechnologists; the Professor\nprovides a good example. Yet even his ideas s bou ld be\nviewed with an objective\nand critical mind.\nReporter: Thank you Sir, and good luck with your\nTime Machine.\nby Philo S Ophaster\nWelfare information\nOver the vacation\nThe Centre will remain\nopen on Mondays, Wednesdays,\nand Fridays from 12.30pm to\n1.30pm.

Mr Webb, saving himself\nfor the Nationals came round\nin 16mins10 secs.

Both\nAndy and Mike were persuaded\nto run for the LSE thus giving\nus only one non-runner.\nThe senior race started\ndownhill and a sea of bobbing\nheads could be seen flowing\ndown the hill. The temporary\neuphoria was replaced after\nhalf a mile when the uphill\nsection started and the\nrunning became difficult. A number of sand traps and a sharp downhill stretch were\nonly fun bits on a remarkably\nuninteresting spectators course.\nRob All in son had a fine\nrace, finishing 163rd in his first senior National.

Ian\nEllis finished in 586th,56 places in front of David Rosen\n(of crossword and Orienteering\nfame) and 79 places in front\nof Steve Webb. The whole\nteam finished inside 1000,\na notable achievement in\nitself. IC should therefore\nfinish about half-way in the\nteam order out of about 200\nathletic clubs entering.\nThe post race enquiry\nrevealed that Mr Webb had\nlost a shoe, losing him about\na minute.

The A's reserves\nhad to be press-ganged into\nservice to even things out.\nSteve Downing and Phil John were the 'volunteers',\nalthough it must be recorded\nthat it took a tea ticket to\nget Steve into the right frame\nof mind for doing his duty.\nAll that having been settled\nthe game commenced with the\nRN VR electing to play into\na deceptive wind. It took only\nfive minutes, and Mike\nSiomiak, to show them the\nerror of their ways. Dick\nPullen converted and the\nflood gates (sorry I) were\nopened. The A's were up 1 8 - 0\nbefore RN VR could rally to\noffer any significant resistance\nand that, not to put too fine a point on it, was contemptuously\nswept aside. The A's plunged\non to a340 lead at half time,\nfollowing tries by John Day\n(two), Rod Porter and George\nSweatman.\nPlaying into the wind was\na different story. Soon after\nthe start Phil John,( on\nloan to the RN VR), suffered\nsuch a confusion of loyalties\nthat he pulled a try back f q,r the JNIavy, (but he made up for\nit later by giving Mike\nSiomiak his second try). The\n50\n13\nlead was cut further by a penalty. Having conceded\nnine points the A's decided\nto make a comeback. Mike's second try was followed by\ntries from Bob Leeson and\nJohn Thomas (making amends\nfor last week). The last score\nof the match went to the\nNavy. It should have been\nscored by the A's but Rich\nJenner, with a three-man\noverlap, gave a forward pass. Thus, the A's won by\n5 0 - 1 3 , their highest score\nof the season and a fitting\nend, for it was the last\ngame.\nThe A's have played fifteen\ngames of which they have\nwon eight and lost seven,\nwith 268 points for and 216\npoints against. Jon Pitcher\nfinished top try scorer with\nseven, just ahead of Chris Becque with six tries. Top\nscorer Queto his seven\nconversion's on Saturday, was\nDick Pullen who finished\nwith thirty-three points.\nTeam:- R Pullen, L Davies, C Becque, R Leeson, J Pitcher,\nJ Thomas, GSweatman, WBubb,\nA Fitzgerald, J Day, C Cuthbertson, R Porter, J Fishburq, R Jenner, M Siomiak.\nThe A's would like to thank\nChris Cuthbertson for his\nhard work in arran g ment throughout the season and\nfor his support work in the\nwln\n9- Chris Cuthbectsbn\nA9 AM START on a Sunday\nmorning is difficult, but a9 am start on the morning\nfollowing the 9 mile National\nCross Country championships\nis impossible. So the group\nof athletes who double as\nCrosscountry and Orienteering,\nwere the last to arrive at the\nHAVOC badge event near\nBrentwood, Essex last\nSunday. The late start meant\nthat unless some very fast\ntimes were recorded IC would\nnot be able to make the pub\nbefore closing time.\nThe course was fairly flat\nbut there were some areas\nof rather dense undergrowth\n(including holly bushes!) to\nfight through. Also the\ncompact nature of the course\nmeant that it doubled back\non itself many times and\noccasionally gave a distinct\nsense of deja vu.\nOn the 11km' A' course\nDavid Rosen was 1st home in\na time of 69.23 underlining\nthe reason for his selection\nfor the international match\nin France next week. Alistair Doyle of UL was 9th home\nin 86.25 followed closely by Alan Leakey 18th in 89.40\nand Rob All in son23 rd in\nThe first try of this match\nwas scored within 90 seconds\nof the start and that virtually\nheralded the end of it. The\nscore could easily have\nreached three figures but for\nthe handling and running of\nthe forwards and backs. Nevertheless, Ladle jinxed\nhis way to two tries and\nFlanagan playing his first\ngame for IC for two years\ncoasted over for a hat-trick.\nLack, the infamous footballer\nstarring on the left wing,\nalso put the ball over three\n93.05. Some way back were\nSteve Webb in 109.40 and\nPete Johnson, who was seen\nat various times leading in\nrandom directions, in 123.55.\nOn the 9km' B' course Ian\nI sherwood had a very good\nrun, achieving a silver standard, finishing 12th in\n94.25 while Mike Welford was\n21st in 112.37 after reading\nhis compass at the wrong end\nand setting off west instead\nof east!\nOther good placings were\nIan McAnulty and Len Fawcett\nfinishing 4th and 7th in\n112.25 and 123.16 respectively\non the under 21 Course.\nMartin Kessler decided\nthe ' B' course was too much\nlike hard work and instead\nran 'out of class' on the C course finishing in 112.35.\nIC's only woman athlete\nDiane Benge finished 5th in\n98.33 on the woman's'B' course.\nWe all made the pub with\n10 minutes to spare except\nPete (who eventually found\nthe finish) and Jo, Marcus\nplus dog plus friends (who\ndid the way far ers course but\nunfortunately miss seda control).\ntimes. Keith Munday normally\nlegless, found them and scored\nafter a60 yard burst. Mike\nalso got on the score sheet.\nClements had to go off in\nthe second half, but the\nhighlight of the match was a rather inexplicable move\nby Wilkinson. For reasons\napparent only to himself, he\nkicked at a line-out and^t ne forty yard follow-up almost\nfinished off the referee.\nThe most successful outing\nfor the B2's in recent weeks\nwas celebrated in fine style. IC B2's48 Watford 0\ncontinued from page 6\nAs with all Chandler stories, the\nplot is fairly involved and moves at a fairly brisk pace. Marlowe is hired by\nMoose Malloy (Jack O 'Halloran), an\noversized brute and bank robber, out on\nparole and looking for his girl friend\nVelma.\nVelma, however, does not want to\nbe found and poor Marlowe gets really\nkicked around and pumped full of drugs\nin his attempts to find her. His lot is\nnot helped, by the police who want to\nuse him as a scapegoat for several\nunsolved murders.\nIn the final scene, on a floating\ncasino, everything is revealed and\neach gets his/ her\" just\" deserts.\nThe winner; Marlowe.\n\" Diamonds\"( Fox-Rank, A) Directed\nby Menahem Golan; starring Robert\nShaw, Richard Roundtree, Barbara\nSeagull and Shelley Winters.\nThe Hodgson brothers have only one\nthing in common; diamonds. Charles deals in them and Earl protects them.\nA little brotherly hatred causes problems\nand poor Archie (Richard Roundtree),\nfresh out of jail, is caught in the\nmiddle.\nArchie is hired by Charles( Robert\nShaw) to \" rob\" the largest Diamond\nexchange in the world. The exchange, in\nTel Aviv, is supposedly fool-proof\n(with safes and security by Earl). There is a\" simple\" plot with a few\ndistractions thrown in. The acting is\nreasonable with Robert Shaw leading the\npack, a varied bunch. The Three Degrees\nsing the song \" Diamonds\" \u2014 just\nbeautiful.\nMusic\nHeaven and Hell (RCA) by Vangelis\nThis is avar it able one-man marathon.\nV angelis composed all the music,\nplayed all the instruments, sundry or\notherwise, and produced and arranged\nthe album to boot. Yet, the album does\nnot sink into the self-indulgent rut\nthat similar solo efforts tend to do. It is however, rather difficult to\ndescribe his music, certainly, it has\nmany influences. My first impression\nwas that he had taken some Magma times,\ncut out most of the percussion, and\nsubstituted masses of keyboards, and\nthrown in the vocal chorus to hear what\nit would sound like. (Good in parts, a bit strange in others).\nIf you are into semi classical music\nyou' ll enjoy this one. One point worth\nnoting here is the excellent production.\nThe Tymes: Tymes Up ( RCA) Once you get over the nauseating\ncover design it is possible to get down\nto enjoying what is a rather pleasant\nalbum. It comes from the stable of\ncommercialised soul/funky music.\nI personally find the album somewhat\nover produced, but a few tracks do stand\nout. \" Only Your Love\" and \" It's Cool\" on side one, the latter is a particularly\ngood especially in the vocals department.\nThe only track I actually went into\nraptures over is the first one on side\ntwo; \" Hypnotized\". Everything that\nshould be in a good record is embodied\nin this fine piece. Produced by Billy Jackson, for\nFlower Pot Productions, the album also\nfeatures TSO P on strings and horn.\n\n"
