    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 1 6TH1996 NEWS\nNews in brief\nULU constitution debated\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nThe University of London\nUnion's constitution became a subject of heated discussion at\nICU Council meeting on\nMonday evening. Ghassan\nKarian, President ol UL U, was\ninvited to the meeting to talk on\nthe four month review of the\nconstitution.\nIn his speech, Mr Karian said\nthat the recent Education Act\nwhich reformed the structure of\nstudent unions, and pressure to\nmake the Union more accountable were the main driving forces\nbehind the review. The UL U initiated a consultation process\nwhich began in September, and\nis now reaching its conclusion\nwith ratification by the student\nunions of the University.\nThe main changes from the\nold constitution involve representation of the medical schools\nand the proposal to introduce a new Sports and Societies sabbatical post. The medical schools are\ncurrently grouped together as\n\"Med Group\" and send 20-30\ndelegates to the General Union\nCouncil of UL U but the mergers\nbetween medical schools and colleges brought about by the\nTomlinson report have changed\nthis.\nUnder the new rules,\nLondon's medical schools together have only 4 delegates to the\nSenate between them. Some\nmedics have said that this means\nthat they will have less representation on the new body. One\ncouncil member suggested that\nthe fact that the medical schools\nwill still send delegates to GU C separately from their parent colleges was just \"half-cocked\nappeasement\", defeating the aim\nof the integration of the medical\nschools. Mr Karian said that\nthere would be another review in\nfive years time.\nThe Sports and Societies\nsabbatical post was proposed as a solution to the conflict of interest between the Sports Council\nPresident and the VP for Sports\nand Recreation. The two positions will be merged to form the\nnew post with the aim of improving efficiency.\nA motion to implement the\nnew document, sponsored by\nU LUV P Tara Jefferson, was\napproved by Council.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nSouthside robber\ncharged\nThe burglar apprehended in the\nSouthside Halls two weeks ago as\nreported in Felix 1048, has been\ncharged by the police on three\ncounts of burglary. The name of\nthe burglar has not been released\nyet, though he is believed to be\nfrom the London area.\nIC's Deputy Head of\nSecurity, Kenneth Weir, still has\nsome property in his possession\nrecovered at the time of the bur-gla ry, for which no owner has\ncome forward. If you lost a large\nmen's suit at the time of the\nthefts, Mr Weir at the security\ncontrol in Sherfield will be\npleased to help you.\nA Measure of Mary's A ground breaking appearance of\nSt Mary's Dramatic Society at\nICU next week has raised hopes\nof more cooperation between\nMary's and IC. Shakespeare's play Measure for Measure is currently being shown at St Mary's Union. The production is being\nbrought over to South\nKensington for performances on\nTuesday and Wednesday.\nMarines play at the\nAlbert Hall\nThe Albert Hall was taken over\nby the massed bands of Her\nMajesty's Royal Marines this\nweek as they presented the\nMountbatten Festival of Music\n1996 in aid of charity. Security\nwas tight, however, with several\nroads closed to parking and the\narea patrolled by police all week.\nPhysics computer chips\nstolen\nThe Physics department was the\nvictim of yet another computer\nhardware robbery over the week-end. A. selection of memory chips\nwere taken from personal computers in a fourth floor teaching\nlaboratory.\nSecurity believe that the\nthief 'piggy-backed' in to the\nbuilding behind a legitimate user\nof the department, and urged\nstudents and staff alike to be\naware of this method of entry by\ncriminals.\n'Drop-in' students get\n\u00a3450 fine\nTwo geology students called to\nUnion disciplinary after breaking\ninto ICU Print Unit earlier this\nmonth have been charged with\nthe cost of the damage they\ncat is ed. Last Friday's meeting also\nbanned from entering the Union\npremises for the rest of this\nterm. The IC band Herb had to\npull out of the Jazz, Rock and\nEnts . Friday night rock\n\"Abandon\" on finding that one of\ntheir member was no longer\nallowed in the building.\nSenior Union sources have\nexpressed disappointment that\nthe punishment was too lenient.\nNew life found on\nEarth\nResearchers in America\nannounced this week that they\nhave discovered a new type of\nlifeform, distinct from all others.\nThe work in Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park concentrated on the genetic differences between various microbes,\nutilising recent advances in structural molecular biology. This has\nmeant that microbes that are\noutwardly similar in structure\nhave been revealed to be somewhat different at a genetic level.\nThe discoverer of these new lifeforms claims that it will revolution is e the way scientists classify\nspecies.\nOn a related note, builders\nin Romania have uncovered a cave containing 31 new species.\nThe cave was originally under\nwater, but became separated\nwhen the Black Sea water level\nfell. Inside the cave, there has\nbeen no sunlight for 5 million\nyears, and the creatures have\nestablished an alternate food\nchain exclusive of photo syn the sis. Scientists have established\nthat all the energy for the ecosystem originates from when bacteria oxidise the hydrogen sulphide\nabundant in the cave.\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN UL U President Ghassan Karian spoke to ICU's Council meeting on\nMonday, encouraging members to support his new constitution.\n\n"

See posters\nfor details.\nSunday Paintballing\nWelcome to the heady world of paint balling the fastest growing sport in Europe. Paintball\nis the ultimate adrenaline rush and this article\nis the ultimate guide to getting you started. In\nbrief, it is most like a grown up version of\ncops and robbers or cowboys and Indians. The\nplayers are normally split up into two teams\nand the idea is to mark the opposition with\npaintball s fired from a gun (paintball marker).\nTheir effective range is about thirty yards,\nwith a fair degree of accuracy.\nDepending on\nthe site, you may\nbe playing in\nwoodland, with\nstreams and lakes.\nAlternatively, some venues have\nan urban setting,\nwith specially\nadapted buildings\nand surroundings.\nThe games tends\nto differ from site\nto site, but you\nmay be playing a normal two flag\ngame, where the\nobjective is to capture the oppositions flag and\nreturn it to your\nbase, while at the\nsame time stopping the other team doing the\nsame to your flag. Whatever the game, the\noutcome relies greatly on your tactics and\ncunning or your complete disregard for caution and a mad dash for the flag under a hail\nof paint.\nDoes it hurt? This is one of the most\ncommon question we get asked (after \"How\nmuch does it cost?\"]. The answer is, if you are\nwearing sensible clothing - a jumper and\ntrack suit trousers under the overalls which\nare supplied then, no. Paintball injuries tend\nto fall into the sprains and bruises category.\nHowever, to uphold this excellent reputation\nsafety is the key word at all sites. On arrival\nyou will be issued with a set of industry standard goggles before you even see a paintball\ngun. These goggles should become your best\nfriend, unless in the specified 'safe zone' you\nshould be wearing your goggles at all times.\nHow much will it cost? Paintball can be a relatively expensive sport. However, ICU's paintball club has excellent contacts with\nsites, which allow us to negotiate prices that\nare substantially cheaper than the normal.\nDuring a typical day, which involves 8-10\ngames, we expect average first time players to\nspend around \u00a330. This estimation includes\nthe site 'green fee' which contributes to the\nupkeep of the site, rental of protective gog-g les, overalls, gun (and gas to power it) and\npaint.\nIf you are interested\nin taking your\nfriends into the\nwoods and shooting\nthem, then contact\neither myself,\nWarren Hirst\n(email: w. hirst@ic'.\nac.uk) or Richard\nSwinford (r.s win ford@ic.ac.uk).\nWe have provisionally planned the next\ntrip to be on 16th or\n17th of March. It\nwill be to 'Hot\nShots', who are\nbased at RAF Greenham Common\n- a spectacular site\nwith superb fac ili ties. The playing zone has over 100 two story\nbuildings to play in and around. All glass has\nbeen removed to allow you to jump in and\nout of windows (there are doorways, for the\nless energetic), staircases allow access to\nupper levels and these are notoriously hard to\ncapture.\nPlease contact us by e mail if you are\ninterested and we can get more details back\nto you. Enquiries from anyone are welcome,\nhowever, remember it is a lot more fun to go\npaint balling with your friends so drag them\nalong. We are happy to be joined by other\nsocieties, departments and halls who are\nlooking for something different to do.\nKeep low, shoot straight and may your\nballs burst on impact.\n\n"

    "content": "At last for those dieters who can't resist a snack between meals,\nProcter and Gamble have developed Olestra, a fat free fat. But just\nhow healthy is a fat free diet and how healthy is Olestra?\n>in\nSnack Attack! Could fat make you thin?\nOlestra is the dieter's dream:\na fat like any other fat with\none vital difference - it contains absolutely no calories. For some,\nOlestra is the ultimate slimming product\nthat promises to take the guilt out of glut-tony. But some scientists find the idea of\nOlestra just too hard to swallow.\nTwenty-five years after first creating\nOlestra, US food manufacturers Procter\nand Gamble last month received the go\nahead from the American FDA( Food and\nDrug Administration) to manufacture foods\ncontaining Olestra. A new range of low-calo-rie snack foods to be sold under the name\nOlean will soon be on sale in America. Plans\nare afoot to make them available in the UK. But there was just one condition to the\nFDAs approval of Olestra. All foods made\nwith it most carry a warning saying: \"Olestra\nmay cause abdominal cramping and loose\nstools. Olestra inhibits the absorption of\nsome vitamins and other nutrients\". This is\nhardly an app et ising advert for any food and\nwith a message like that you may wonder if\nOlestra really is good for you.\nOlestra is a specially designed fat made\nof a mixture of sugar and vegetable oil. It can\nbe used for cooking and works just like any\nother fat but, because ol its structure, the\nbody cannot break it down and absorb it\ninto the blood stream. Olestra' has no calories because it stays completely unchanged\nas it slips through the body. What is more, it\nhas a strong affinity for vitamins A,D and K. On its way through the digestive system\nOlestra sucks up these vitamins and vacuums them out of the body. Procter and\nGamble have partly countered this effect by\nadding extra vitamins to Olestra so that, like\na hoover with a hill bag, it is already too hill\nof vitamins to pick up any more.\nOlestra also sucks up nutrients called\ncarotenoids as it passes through the body.\nThe role of carotenoids is not hilly under-stood, but it is suggested that carotenoids\nare essential for a healthy immune system\nand may be useful in preventing some forms\nof cancer. Eating just three gram mes of\nOlestra causes a40% decrease in\ncarotenoids. Procter and Gamble\nhave not altered Olestra to deal w^ J with this effect because the ^?W. JL\nexact role of carotenoids in the diet has not\nbeen established.\nOlestra can also give you wind, diarrhoea\nand in some cases it causes anal leakage. But\nProcter and Gamble scientists, Chris\nHassall, points out that eating too much\nfibre gives you diarrhoea and too much fat\ncan also lead to anal leakage. Michael\nJacobson, Chief Executive of the Center for\nScience in the Public Interest, and one of\nOlestra's strongest opponents says \"Olestra\nacts like a laxative and robs the body of\nnutrients. We don't need Olestra potato\nchips. It's crazy to add a substance to the\nfood supply that makes people sick.\"\nWhether or not Olestra makes people\nsick is exactly what the FDA had to find out.\nAfter wading through around 150,000\npages of test results, a panel of specialists\ndecided the substance was not poisonous\nand did not interfere with the action of\nmedicines. Olestra had to undergo very\nstringent testing. The FDA has never tested\na food additive with the potential to take up\nsuch a large part of people's diet. Normally\ntests involve giving rats 100 times the\namount of the food additive that ah tim an would normally eat. For Olestra this would\nmean feeding rats on nothing else, which\nwould certainly kill them. Instead, 8000\nmen, women and children across America\ntook part in tests to assess the effects of eating Olestra. The FDA has ruled \"with reasonable certainty\" that Olestra is \"harm-less\".\nOlestra genuinely gives food the same\nthe pleasant texture as normal fats. The all-important \"mouth-feel\", so often absent\nfrom diet foods, is very much there with\nOlestra. But what are the chances that it will\nmake you thin? Dieticians and doctors have\ndiffering views. George Blackburn, nutrition\nscientist at Deaconess Hospital Boston says:\n\"ft could (make a difference) if people follow the dietary guidelines; that is, they eat\neverything in moderation. If they use it as a licence to over consume, it'll have no effect\".\nGeraldine Fitzgerald, aUK nutritionist, says\n\"I very much doubt it will work. Nearly all\nAmerican studies have shown that people\nwill eat just as many calories by supplementing their diet with other foods.\"\nNutrasweet and other low calorie sweeteners have done little to overcome the\nweight problem of either America or\nBritain. Olestra snacks may let us enjoy the\npleasure of eating for half the calories and\nwith less of the guilt, bt it it is unlikely to\nsolve many people's weight problems.\nNatalie Barb\n\n"

It reaches our shores with high Oscar\nprospects and a completely British lu wie cast.\nHowever, contrary to most British period costume dramas, this isn't from the Merchant Ivory\nhim company but is directed by Taiwanese Ang\nLee (Eat Drink Man Woman) who seems to give\nthe film a bit more life and realism than a Merchant Ivory production.\nWe enter the\nstory as mother and\nthree daughters,\nElinor (Thompson),\nMarianne (Kate Wins- Jj|\nlet) and Margaret have\nlost their father and \u2022\nare left with little\nmoney due to the\nlaws governing inheritance. Before the\nDashwood women\nleave their home\nElinor falls in love with\nthe endearing Edward\nFerrars (Hugh Grant),\nbrother of their step-brother's wife, the\ndomineering Fanny Ferrars. This obvious mutual\nattraction goes unsaid and is prevented from\nblossoming as Edward is forced off to London by\nhis family. Fanny couldn't let Edward marry\nsomeone without money or social stature. Mrs\nDashwood's cousin, Sir John Middleton takes\nthe four women under his wing aided by Mrs\nJennings who tries her best to marry off the two\ndaughters. This unwanted interference is not\nvery productive yet Marianne's affairs of the\nheart flourish as she falls hook, line and sinker for\nthe dashing Willoughby (Greg Wise). When he\ncomes to her rescue when she sprains her ankle!\nAll this is much to the dismay of the more\nrestrained but no less infatuated Colonel\nBrandon (Alan Rickman) who has a tragic lost\nlove past. He isn't willing to wear his heart on his\nsleeve so will Edward visits the Dashwoods as he\npromised and confesses his affections for Elinor?\nWho will Marianne chose, the reliable and caring\nColonel Brandon\nThe beautiful scenery\nthe charming rogue\nWilloughby?\nThe story unfolds with\nlittle moments of comedy often supplied by\nthe bluntness of Mr\nPalmer (Hugh Laurie)\nand you soon become\nthoroughly engrossed\nin the intricate relationships ofthe characters. The quality of the\ncast makes the story\nbelievable, it's romantic and sad but not over\nthe top as can often\nhappen with British\nfilms aimed at the\nAmerican audience,\nadds to the sense of\nescapism of the film and even though this is a period drama it's very easy to identify with the\ncharacters. Even the most cynical audience can't fail to leave the cinema with a warm glow alternatively this could be because the heating was up\ntoo high!\nfilm: ju man j Ls rec s martin sen ven 'In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read\nsix or eight'. These were the words with which\nAlan Parish disappeared into the mysterious\nboard game, Jumanji, after starting the game in\n1969 with his soul mate Sarah. 26 years later,\ntwo unsuspecting children, Judy (Kirsten\nDunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce), find the\ngame in the de re licked Parish household. After\nstarting the game with the remaining two pieces,\nthey inadvertently release Alan (Robin Williams)\nback into the real world, sporting a very long\nbeard and classic jungle attire. It turns out that\nperils from the jungle haunt the players until\nsomeone reaches the end, and to make matters\nworse, the players that start have to go on. After\ntackling the rather large lion and killer mosquitoes that they have released into the world, the\n3 strong team go off to find Sarah (Bonnie\nHunt), who is still undergoing psychiatric treatment after seeing Alan disappear.\nThe plot continues with the four of them\nplaying the game, apprehensively reading the\nmessages in the centre of the board and awaiting\ntheir fate. Together they manage to survive a monsoon, vicious monkeys, herds of rhinos and\na rather amusing hunter called the Exterminator.\nAlthough the plot sounds rather weird (to say\nthe least!) it is nonetheless very enjoyable for a wide audience, including all you logically mind-ed, scientific Imperial students. At the very least,\nyou'll marvel at what represents some of today's best examples of computer rendered graphics. If\nyou want a totally fantastic and wacky film, with\nloads of laughs, then go and see Jumanji.\n\n"

We're talking a lot of melancholy and \"this world is bad\" feel-ing.\n'Spaceman'stands out as the ,\nbest song by a long way.\nHowever, other tracks such as the 'Is Your Soul\nFor Sale' (almost Pink Floyd-ish with its piano and\nvocal intro gently overlaid with weird sound\neffects), and Animal Army' (using a very Lou *\nReed-ish bass line) also stand out.\nIf you listened to a couple of particular tracks\nyou might think that this Babylon Zoo character\nwas doing hard rock. However, if you listened to\na couple of different ones you\nmight think that he was into psychedelic ballads. In other words,\nit's hard to class i ly this type of\nmusic but I get the lee ling that\nJas Mann was going for a category created by Pink Floyd's 'The\nII Wall'. The similarities are un can \u2022 ny - the segued tracks, the songs\nabout personal hates and political regimes and, most of all, the\nsneering vocals.\nAt the end ol the day, this album\ncomes nowhere near 'The Wall'\nas far as quality is concerned but the potential for\nan album of that stature is definitely there. (6)\nalbum: saw doctors -same o ul' town nr. trout\nIt is difficult to write about the Saw Doctors without using words like \"charm\", \"folksy\", \"tradition-al\" and \"roots y\" because these are words that\ndescribe them so well. However, to categorise\nthem as just another Irish folk band would do\nthem no justice.\n'Same Oul' Town' is an album of rare class in\nwhich biting social comment and heartfelt longing\n(\"I want you more than a pint after closing time\"\n- 'I Want You More') are masked by deceptively\nsweet sing-along me lodes. There are some weaker tracks. The title\ntrack, for example, falls into the age-old trap of a slow song ending up like a dirge. However, even\nthen/Les Moran and Davy Carton's lyrics can\nalways raise an interesting thought, or at least a smile.\nThe overall feeling that I get of the Saw\nDoctors is that of a high IQ Shane MacGowan on\nProzac. In other words, this album is just not to be\nmissed. (9)\n\n"

    "content": "DIARY FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 1 6TH1996. TWENTY-THREE\nThe Experience of Structural Adjustment in Jamaica\nAngela Stultz Crawlle of Jamaica will be\nspeaking at IC on Thursday about the social\nconsequences of 'structural adjustment'- the\nInternational Monetary Fund's policy on\ndevelopment which stipulates that borrowing\nmust be linked to the opening of economies\nto international market forces.\nJamaica is a particularly interesting case\nas it was one of the first countries to take part\nin the process of structural adjustment. In\n1977, following several years of recession and\noil price increases, the Jamaican economy\nwas in decline. The government was forced\nto borrow heavily, primarily from the IMF which lent on the condition that an austere\nfiscal policy was embraced. This included the\ncutting of government spending and the\nremoval of all food subsidies. The IMF encouraged Jamaica to target developing\nindustries, arguing that the economy's vulnerability was due to its lack of diversity.\nThe IMF has been similarly involved in\nthe economic affairs of Jamaica ever since.\nHowever, little improvement has been\nIF YOU POOR NATIONS WANT MORE\nLOANS, HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEEGet a Life!\nLet me guess, you're a scientist, you like your\ndrink, and most importantly, you're totally\nbroke. When you leave Imperial with your\nfirst class degree, little will have changed,\nexcept your overdraft will no longer be interest free and alcohol will become a luxury you\ncan no longer afford. To tread those corridors\nof wealth that you've been dreaming about,\nyou need more than a first class degree, you\nneed a life. Unfortunately drinking the\n'chaps' under the table is likely not to\nimpress future employers. You need aCV that reads as well as Terry Venables latest\nline up, err, okay bad example, how about\nthe Brazilian line up? As an alternative to\nlying in order to bulk up your CV, you could\ndo something valuable with your spare time\n(that's when the bar is closed).\nSciTech is a student consultancy run by.\nIC students. It is a concept originally Irom\nEurope where companies are able to pay students to work on projects for them. The\ncompanies get a cheap yet competent work\nforce, and the students get a chance to make\nuseful contacts with the industrial world,\nwhilst gaining valuable CV points. For more\ninformation about SciTech, turn up to one of\nthe meetings in room 307 in Civ Eng, contact\nus through e mail at sc its l(<v ic.ac.uk or via\nthe Union pigeon holes under SciTech.\nThere are positions to be filled on the com-mitte e, specifically within the European\nNetwork and IC Liaison or you may just wish\nto add your name to our student database in\norder to partake in future projects.\nrealised; as Richard Bernal, Jamaica's ambassador to the UN has commented:\n\"The policies of the 1980's have reinforced old structures, especially dependence\non imported food. We have, seen none of the\npromised upsurge in production. The high-tech a gro chemical projects have failed. The\nvulnerability of the economy to external\nforces is greater than ever.\"\nThe economy may not have changed but\nthe social conditions in Jamaica have. The\ndamage that has been done to the social infrastructure as a result of the government's tight\nfiscal policy has been immense. Basic services\nhave been fundamentally damaged. For\nexample spending in education has gone\ndown by 30% in real terms. As a result, thousands of teachers have left the country in\nsearch of better pay and work conditions.\nMore immediate problems have been\nexperienced in the health service; an acute\nlack of funding has resulted in many workers\nbeing forced into the private sector. At pre-sent, 64% of nursing positions are vacant.\nCareers Information Summer Vacation Training opportunities\nare now available on the database in the\nCareers Office. Apply to UROP for research\nopportunities.\n\"Improve, your interview skills\" is a short\ncourse on Wednesday 21st February in\nHuxley Room 343 from 2-4 pm. Sign up in\nthe Careers Office.\nFor more information and careers advice\ncome to the Careers Office, Room 310\nSherfield Building, which is open between\n10am and 5.15pm Monday to Friday.\nHomeopathy FREE Homoeopathic treatment is available\nto students of Imperial College on Monday\nafternoons at Imperial College Health\nService, Princes Gardens.\nALL ailments and conditions can be\nhelped by Homoeopathy, which uses safe\nand natural remedies to enhance our general\nhealth and well-being. Whatever the problem - eczema, asthma, hay fever, anxiety,\ndepression, insomnia etc. Homoeopathy\noffers an alternative approach which can not\nonly sort out your particular problem but\nalso improve your overall level of health at\nthe same time, so you become less susceptible to illness in future.\nSo, don't delay, contact Rosalind\nGeorge on (0171) 603 8600 to make an\nappointment today\nSo why has Jamaica lost both its social\nservices and failed to revive its economy? The\nanswer must be related to the country's debt\nproblem. As the World Bank has pointed out,\n\"In 1991/92 half of tax revenues went to\nservice external debt, while roads deteriorated for lack of maintenance, schoolchildren\nwere short of books, and hospitals were short\nof medicines. The indirect efforts compounded the problem by slowing growth.\nThe high debt burden makes business reluctant to invest in Jamaica, and encourages\nyoung people to move abroad if they have\nacquired education and skills to achieve\naccess to the international labour market.\"\nJamaica's problems are complicated with\nno easy solutions. Without dealing with the\ndebt problem and re-examining the present\npolicy towards the count ri y's infrastructure,\nthe situation can only get worse. The\nJamaican example certainly challenges the\nvalidity of structural adjustment.\nThird World First: 12.45pm, Thursday\nFebruary 22nd, Huxley 341\nEAT LESS\nExam Stress Workshops Exam stress workshops will be held at the\nHealth Centre over two sessions - from 3pm to 4.30pm on the afternoons of\nWednesday 6th March f996 and\nWednesday 13th March 1996\nTo take full advantage of these sessions,\nyou are advised to attend both.

I'm still in a state\nof great nervous tension: I suspect the memory will haunt me\nfor years. My interviewer asked\nwhat was 'the most creative\nthing I had ever done'. I'm not\ngoing to tell you what I said in\nresponse, because it's simply far\ntoo embarrassing. What worries\nme almost as much as the realisation that I have, developed the\nability to spout management\nconsultant-esque cheesy drivel is\nthe fact that he honestly seemed\nto feel that it was a good reply.\nStill, all is not lost, and into\nthe void left when I rushed off to\nbe an executive, Civil Engineering's Mr Cedd Burge has ably\nstepped to take over the rest of\nthe editorial...\n/ have a little story about\nGerald Johnson, a pillar of\nstrength in the highly dedicated\nX Coitntry community. Gerald\nis unfortunately a diabetic, and\nhas to put himself through the ritual steroid / cocaine jokes every\ntime he gets his needle out. When\nexercising, low blood sugar can be\na particularly big problem, and\nthe possibility of being a long way\nfrom a chocolate machine if one\nfeels the need. Now the obvious\ndrawback to this plan is the lack\nof pockets in your average pair of\nlycra shorts. But Gerald has covered all bases by sticking a mars\nbar down his pants. Usually when\nGerald trains the mars bar is\nwholly uneaten by the time he's finished, although often fairly wet\nand squishy.\nGerald is one of the more\ndedicated runners (Honest), and\ngenerally exercises 4 or 5 times a week. As Gerald agrees eating the\nmars bar after the run would be\nquite a grim task, so he does not,\nprefer ing instead to buy a new\none. However Gerald has hit\nhard times recently, his bank balance reaching the \"5 pounds over\nthe limit, no you can't have any\nmore you skin t bastard\" stage.\nThis caused Gerald to introduce\nsome cost cutting measures, and\nthe first obvious thought was to\ncut down on the excess mars bars.\n'The mars bar recycling plan'\ninvolves having the same mars\nbar down his pants every time he\ngoes out. It was all going very well\nuntil one fateful day, after 3.5\nmonths of hard slog with the same\nsweaty mars bar, the man felt an\noncoming desire to lose con cio us ness, and had to make the decision that was later described by\nme to be \"about as stupid as the\nblok e who decided to bomb\nCanary Wharf\".

During the course of\nthe evening our enjoy e ment was\ninterrupted several times by the\nworrying sight of fights being\nbroken up by Union\nstewards,who also had the dis-a gre able task of throwing out\nnumerous juvenile drunkards. By\nfar the most annoying behaviour\nwas that of three - to our mind -typical IC students, who seemed\nto find the constant and\nextremely loud impersonation of\nfarm animals (especially donkeys\nand sheep) very amusing. Their\nattitude towards young ladies\nwas equally childish. One young\nlady, who had the misfortune of\npassing by their table several\ntimes, was repeatedly greeted\nwith cries of \"Geeezuss!!\", and\nseemed considerably distressed.\nWe see nothing funny in this, we\nmust assume that it was a private\njoke amongst them.

At the same, time,\nanother of Wilde's plays, 'The Importance of\nBeing Earnest' was also playing in the West End,\nto similar acclaim. Only a few months later both\nhad closed, and Wilde was sentenced to two\nyears imprisonment with hard labour.\nTaken to be the author's most autobiographical work, An Ideal Husband portrays the\nWildean figure of Lord Goring (Martin Shaw) as\nthe oldest friend and confidante of the MP Sir\nRobert Chiltern (David Yelland), who is being\nblackmailed by Mrs Chaveley (Anna Carteret).\nThe play has hardly dated over the past century:\nWilde's accurate observation of the behaviour of\nrelatives, politicians and the scurrilous nature of\nthe Press is just as applicable today.\nWilde preferred his play to be described as\na simple story of a lost bracelet, with its major\ntheme being the difference between the ideals\nand needs of men's and women's love. It is the\nonly area which nowadays may not be considered to be politically correct.\nA very well-padded Martin Shaw as the\ndandy Lord Goring steals the show. Not only\ndoes he have the best lines, but with his extravagant cravats and button holes he is Oscar Wilde\nreincarnate, either lounging casually on a chaise\nlongue or clashing from pillar to post attempting\nto prevent his friend's downfall. He is excellently supported by a superb cast, on a very simple\nopen stage which still manages to convey the\nopulence of the Victorian Mayfair setting.\nAs in any of Wilde's social comedies, we are\nnot short of laughs, but the sympathetic direction instils a new poignancy to the increasingly\nstrained relations between Sir Robert and his\nwife (Penny Downie), making a truly delightful\nproduction.\n-theatre: Stanleyalso claire\nPam Gems, currently the only British female\nplaywright showing in the West End, has written\na stunning play of jealousy, greed seduction and\nspiritualism on the life of the English artist\nStanley Spencer.\nLike his contemporary at the Slade, Dora\nCarrington, his was a life of unconventional relationships, but fulfilled with true love. But unlike\nCarrington and the Bloomsbury set, who he frequently condemned as painting for fashion and\nfrom the mind, Spencer always painted from the heart. To him, painting was an emotional and spiritual\nexperience, enabling\nhim to express his\nGod given talent in\nan English style of\nreligious art. The set\nreflects his strong\nreligious beliefs by\nsurrounding the\nauditorium in\nSpencer's canvasses,\nwhich are strongly reminiscent of church frescoes. Spencer (Antony Sher), in his round glasses\nand scuffed shoes is, even with his artistic maturity, emotionally just a boy. Unable to come to\nterms with his experiences in the trenches of\nWWI, he is brutally honest with his wife\n(Deborah Findlay), whom he treats almost\nmaternally, showing resentment at the loss of\nattention he suffers when their children are\nbom.\nPatricia Preece is the tall, elegant, upper\nclass artist, the complete opposite to Stanley and\nhis wife, who seduces Spencer purely for his influence and money. Such is the power of her\nhold over him, Preece with her own childlike\noutlook of superficial beauty, convinces him to\ndivorce his wife, marry her as well as signing over\nthe house to provide her with an income, but\nonce married preferring to remain with her lover,\nDorothy Hepworth (Selina Cadell). Whether\nPreece was quite as\ncalculating, hedonistic and narcissistic in\nreal life as depicted\nhere, we are not sure,\nbut Anna Chancellor\nportrays her with\nsuch conviction that\nat the end one is not\nsure whether to\napplaud her, such is\nthe hatred she\ninspires.\nThis is an unusual love story: with the part\nof Stanley written for Antony Sher, he brings a realism to the role since he is an artist too, and\nhis honesty brings some engaging comic\nmoments. On leaving though, one is left with a feeling of optimism that even after all he suf-fe red, somehow he could still be at peace with\nhimself and his god.\n\n"

Make of it\nwhat you will.\nRW: Well, I think I 've done a reasonable\namount of it. The big thing I wanted to\ndo was to expand the coverage of what\nwas happening in college and to try and\nto have a better level of communication\nbetween different groups of people that\nare here, and have a more representative basis of the sort of things that go on,\nnot only at Imperial but also nationwide.\nI think we've done that. I 've made a big\neffort to improve contact with the people\nthat actually make decisions about\nImperial at a time that's quite crucial,\nwith big changes. So I think I 've done\nthat well. It's something I guess I focussed on.\nOther stuff, like sport and stuff... it's so\nironic, because I based my manifesto\naround things that people said to me\nwhen I asked them, before I actually got\nhere, when actually I had time to ask\npeople what they thought. They would\nsay things like \"oh, you know we really\nlike the sport pages, we think it's really\nimportant to keep up to date with how\nthe sports teams are doing.\". But when\nit comes down to it, my hands are completely tied, because I can't go to every\nfixture and write a report for them, and if\npeople don't deliver the goods, there's very little you can do. And I guess I feel\nthat's probably the most frustrating thing\nabout it.\nPeople here are quite keen to react,\nusually negatively, but are much more\nloathe to actually contribute. When I say\ncontribute I'm not expecting everyone to\ndrop everything and rush and write a six\npage epic. You know, contribute their\nideas, make suggestions, say \"this is\nwhat I think would be good\", and people\njust don't do that. It is quite difficult.\nI feel slightly proud of the Mary's thing.\nEverybody says every year \"I 'll try and\nimprove relations with Mary's\" and I think I 've done that. The fact that I 've\ngot a news reporter who's a Mary's stu-dent, who's really keen and rushes over,\nand that was something that was really\nimportant to me. We've had an awful lot\nmore news coverage of things that've\nbeen happening over there.\nThe other thing I talked about was Clubs\nand Societies. Well yeah, I think a lot of\nthat stuff tends to only appeal to the\nindividuals involved. I think by spreading\nit out more, making it much more a week ahead - what's going on at\nImperial thing, it makes it less of a couple of pages to flick through. Yeah, I think that's improved a little. I wouldn't for one moment suggest it was an\nunmitigated success at all. I'm reasonably happy with things.\n\n"

    "content": "FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 1 6TH1996 NEWS\nHE funding backtrack by Shephard\nMIKE INGRAM\nThere are signs this week that the\nGovernment is being forced to\nreconsider its position on university funding. In the face of almost\nuniversal opposition to cuts in the\nhigher education budget, splits\nbetween education ministers\nhave come to light.\nThe Education Secretary,\nGillian Shephard, has told the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors\nand Principals (CVCP) that she\nwill present them with broad\nproposals on the size, structure\nand funding of higher education.\nThe proposals are expected to be\nvague, allowing details to be filled\nin after fuller consideration. The\ncommittee has also been presented with a timetable for the discussion of these issues, in time\nfor its meeting today.\nThe move is an attempt to\nhead off action threatened by the\nCVC P if the current funding crisis is not resolved. These mea-sure s, including the imposition of\na \u00a3300 top-up fee on students,\nare timed to coincide with the\ngeneral election, and could damage the Government's campaign\n[Felix 1049).\nMany within the CVC P feel\nthat the government's promise of\npublic discussion on higher education is merely a delaying tactic.\nClive Booth, vice chancellor of\nOxford Brookes University and\noutgoing vice-chairman of the\ncommittee, said: \"For too long\nGovernment has been saying 'we\nneed a debate'. However, the\ntime has come for some dec i sion.\"\nIn future discussions, vice\nchancellors will be attempting to\n\"tie |the Government] down as\nmuch as possible on policy and\nissues.\" The committee has\nalready produced its own proposals on the future of higher education funding, which will be presented to ministers by the end of\nthe month.\nDifferences of opinion on\nthe future of higher education\nhave even emerged within government ranks. Last week saw\nthe launch of a report on university funding from the\nConservative Political Centre\n(Felix 1049). Speaking at the\nlaunch, the Higher Education\nminister Eric Forth criticised\nparts of the government's education policy. He questioned the\ngovernment's intention to continue increasing availability of higher\neducation: \"It needs to be asked\nwhether the current rate oi 30\nper cent is about the right pro-portion.\"\nMr Forth also rejected the\nreport's proposal that student\nmaintenance be paid for by an\nincome-contingent loan: \"One of\nthe things that irritates me at the\nmoment is that people think that\nif you talk about income contingent loans frequently enough, the\nproblem will go away. That simply won't do.\"\nThe income contingent loans\nscheme is also supported by the\nCVC P and other groups. Sir Eric\nAsh, former Rector of Imperial\nCollege and non-executive director of the Student Loans company described the idea as \"entirely\nsensible\", and inevitable \"in one\nform or another\". The report also\nproposes a national academic\ncredit transfer scheme, an idea\nwhich is supported by the CVC P. Discussions between\nGovernment and universities\nmay not be the only way of making progress on the funding issue.\nThe Association of University\nTeachers repeated its call for a Royal Commission to be set up to\nexamine the \"nightmare issue\" of\nfunding. The proposed\nCommission would examine\nopinions from all sides of the\ndebate, and report next summer\nwith a solution.\nFoot on Wells\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nFormer Labour Party leader, Rt Hon Michael Foot reached deep for\nhis speech on Wednesday evening. He spoke in the Haldane library,\nand attended a reception afterwards.\nBY DAVID COHEN\nHG Wells is often referred to as\nthe father of Science Fiction. He\nis seldom recognised as the social\nthinker that he was. On Wednesday evening, as indeed in\nhis recent biography, Michael\nFoot attempted to highlight this\naspect of Wells' work. A better\nbiographer could not have been\nchosen by Wells' himself for such\na task (Foot was leader of the\nLabour party between 1980-1983, and is a staunch socialist\nhimself).\nFrom his allegorical treatment of Imperialism in \"War of\nthe Worlds\", criticising its inhumanity, to his prognostication\nregarding the effects of atomic\npower in \"World Set Free\", Wells\ntrained his mind not only on the\ncontemporary problems of\nhumanity, but also those of the\nfuture. To illustrate, Foot read a passage from \"World Set Free\" in\nwhich Wells imagined the Strand\npopulated with unemployed people \"shamelessly begging.\"\nLater Wells wrote about his\nvision of Utopia, collecting his\nidylls of humanity in this tome. It\nis perhaps saddening to then\nlearn that towards the end of his\nlife he became despondent and bitter. Perhaps it is not sur pris ing, considering these last\nthoughts were written during,\nand after the Second World War,\nsoon after which he died.\nMichael Foot clearly admires\nWells as a novelist but above all\nas a visionary thinker. As such it\nwould be inappropriate to compare these two characters on\nthese grounds, Foot seems to be\nthe perfect pupil and humble disciple of Wellsian thought.\nDespite a frail frame and a malignant tun our on his left eye,\nFoot delivered an eloquent\nspeech and, unlike Wells in his\nold age, is still resolute in his\nbeliefs.\nIn particular, he is no less\nanxious about the nuclear threat,\ndespite the recent non-pro lifer a tion treaty (which, he says, Wells\npredicted as being the only way\nto control this form of technological advancement).\nIt is easy to be cynical about\nFoot's motives to publish this\nwork exactly 50 years after\nWells' death, but in fact a European Union directive has\nbeen issued to extend the copyright period. It seems Foot is a genuine socialist warrior to the\nlast.\n\n"

If they'd said you\nwere mad, you could have blamed the very high\nworkload, which we all know is a problem.\nLast Friday, I was driving through West\nLondon and heard on the radio that there had\nbeen an explosion in Docklands. I immediately\nthought that this must be due to gas, but later\nheard that it was the work of the IRA. My reaction was one of anger and despair. The peace had\nindeed been slow and difficult, but the ceasefire\nhad held and the international efforts being\nmade were looking positive. Then as soon as the\nproposal for elections was made, which met\nwith Sinn Fein's total opposition, the IRA chose\nto return to their old ways. In doing so, they have\ndestroyed all the credibility that\ntheir political wing had started to\nbuild, and plunged the talks into\n* '. m crisis. This was a particularly evil\nand fru ides s attack by the IRA,\nwhich has merely succeeded in\nstrengthening the call for arms\nde corn rn is sion ing and turned the\nIrish Government against Sinn\nFein. One might imagine that\nGerry Adams would immediately\n|j seek to condemn the bombing.\nNo. He blamed the Government.\nWhat is more, he telephoned the White House\nshortly before the explosion to say that he had\nsome \"disappointing news.\" This is extremely\nsignificant. Despite his protestations, did Adams\nknow of the bomb before its explosion? The vital\nquestion is that if he did, and if he is serious\nabout peace, why didn't he warn the authorities?\nIf not, and he is not intimately linked with the\nIRA, then why on earth-should we be talking to\nhim? It is widely known that British intelligence\nhas much evidence (although not enough to\nbring charges) on the alleged terrorist activities of\nboth him and Martin McGuinness, supposedly a former head of the IRA. General Council. One\ncan only hope that the peace process has not\nbeen ir recon c il ably damaged.\nOn a happier note, I saw that it was the 40th birthday of the Routemaster bus. As anyone who\nknows me will realise, I am not an enormous fan\nof buses - they tend to attract the slowest, rudest and weirdest members of society. The exception to this sad state of affairs is the Routemaster,\na design classic that manages to avoid bringing\nout the worst in people and creates a contented\natmosphere within its dignified body. I know\nthat they cost more to run, being crewed by two\npeople, but dare I say, what the Hell. If cost\nbecame a problem, we could always charge\ntourists quadruple fare to travel on these famous\nvehicles. Not that I think tourists are gullible you\nunderstand...\ncd magazine - blende ii an Blender is a magazine with a difference: it comes\non CD-Rom. It also costs more than a small\nCaribbean island. And it's a huge bunch of arse.\nSeriously, it does cost more than a small\nCaribbean island, and it is a bunch of arse. After\nreceiving the initial package of an impressive-looking box, I was disheartened to find that the\nbox contained only one measly CD with no\nmates. Slipping it deftly into my machine I was\nthen rather perturbed to find that I had to fill my\nhard disk full of Mac software. The Blender box\ndistinctly says 'for Windows and Mac', but it\nappears to be only for Mac users and people who\nwish that they had a Mac.\nThe 'magazine' contains a large number of\narticles, but unfortunately it appears that the creators have tried to fill the CD with impressive\ngraphics and music at the expense of any con-tent. To my further annoyance, the graphics\nand music were tediously slow and generally of a suspiciously low quality. To my knowledge eight\nbit sound cards are extinct, so why are Blender\nproviding us with pathetic eight bit samples? I have heard better music emanating from the\nStock Aitken and Waterman studio.\nBlender is essentially a very good idea,\nadding sound and visuals to articles in a potentially entertaining and interesting fashion. The\nmagazine format on CD should work well, but\nunless you have a computer worth several thousand pounds, it will just be articles with crappy\nsound and visuals which take several decades to\nload. Putting this fact to one side, the only other\nproblem holding Blender back is the extortionate cover price.\nUntil this situation is remedied, I would\nadvise buying a copy of Computer Shopper and\nsome LSD - it will have the intended effect of\nBlender but at a lower price, and with better\nvisuals.\n\n"

THREE\nNI minister appeal to Sinn Fein\ncontinued from front page\nden ce\" in the intentions of\nnationalists: \"there has to be confidence that the ceasefire s are\nreal\". Both the British and Irish\ngovernments have stated that\nthey will not meet with Sinn Fein\nuntil the IRA reinstate the ceasefire that was broken on Friday\nafter seventeen months. In\nresponse to the continuing\ndemands of Sinn Fein to be\nimmediately included in all-party\ntalks, Sir Patrick said that \"we\nshare that desire\", but that\ndemocratic talks are impossible\nwith the threat of violence: \"no\none can have a gun under the\ntable or a gun outside the door\".\nHe went on to outline the\nstate of the Northern Ireland\npeace process, and the position of\nthe government and other parties\non the continuation of the process\nin the light of the IRA's resumption of violence. He restated the\ngovernment's aims for the\nprocess: \"we are about trying to\nhelp., achieve a lasting settle-ment\", saying that any settlement\nwas \"not to be imposed [and\nmust be | founded on consent\".\nThe minister attacked\nreports from nationalists that the\ngovernment had ignored the conclusions of the Mitchell report on\nthe future of the process, saying\nthey were simply \"not true\". The\ngovernment had accepted all six\nf:? cA\n,r,',?,r, Sabb elections \"very\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nTwo of the contests for next\nyear's ICU sabbatical positions\nlook set to he straight one-horse\nraces. A third is dependant on\none candidate obtaining most of\nhis quota of second ers' signatures\nin the final 24 hours before\npapers come down.\nPiers Williams, Pub Board\nchairman and 'publicity and pro-motions' secretary for STOIC, is\nthe only person standing for the\nposition of Deputy President\n(Finance and Services). Similarly,\nAlex Feakes, news editor of Felix\nand ex-joint editor of the Royal\nCollege of Science Union maga-recommendations in the report,\nhe said, and pointed out the section calling for all parties to sign\nup to the principle of democratic\nmethods. The report also concluded that the IRA was not\ngoing to accede to government\ndemands that it decommission\nweapons before joining talks, and\nsuggested that talks start before\ndecommissioning.\nThe process hit problems\nlast week when the government\ngave support to the Unionist proposal of holding elections in\nUlster leading to all-party talks.\nSir Patrick said the intention of\nthis plan was to \"enable all parties\nto have a democratic mandate.\"\nHe finished by telling of the Irish\npeople's horror at the prospect of\na return to violence, saying that\nthe terrorists \"live in a kind of\nrock pool\", and that 17 months of\npeace had \"reduced their support\nto a minuscule level.\"\nThe minister then opened\nthe floor to questions from the\naudience. On being asked about\ndecommissioning of paramilitary\nweapons and how to measure the\nstability of any return to the\nceasefire s, he said \"of course\n[decommissioning] remains the\nbest [path]\". He agreed with the\nassertion that the ceasefire s should include a ban on punishment beatings\", forced expulsions\nand other crimes the para mili zine Broadsheet, faces only New\nElection as his bid to edit Felix\nnext year.\nAlthough two students have\nsigned up for the position of\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties), James Handley only\nhad seven second ers' signatures\nas Felix went to press. Each can-da date needs to have twenty sec-on der s to be eligible to run. His\nopponent, Neil O 'Shaughnessy,\nhas been fully backed.\nThe position of ICU President is the only one that\nmight be more hotly contested.\nIn the past week, Eric Allsop, the\npresent ICU Council Chair, and\nt aries have continued to commit-throughout the ceasefire: \"we\nhave not had a true peace.\" He\nasserted that the activities had as\nmuch political purpose as the\nbombing campaign, intending to\n\"subvert the RUC\" and \"tell the\npeople the IRA are in charge\".\nThe spectre of a return to\nthe use of internment of terrorist\nsuspects without trial was raised\nby Ian Bayley, who suggested that\nthe policy could be acceptable to\nthe people of Ireland if it was\noperated by some sort of AngloIrish body, representing all sides\nof the community. Sir Patrick\ncommented \"every country has\n[provisions in the legislature] for\ninternment\", intended to be used\n\"as a matter of last resort.\"\nThe British power comes\nunder the terms of the\nEmergency Provisions Act, which\nis up for renewal by Parliament in\nthe near future. The Labour party\nhas previously stated its opposition to keeping the power of\ninternment within the act, but\nthe government is adamant. Sir\nPatrick said \"it is necessary as a matter of prudence to keep that\npower\", adding \"I feel very\nstrongly [that it should remain an\noption]\". He also praised the\nLabour Party's \"staunch support\nfor the government\", insisting\nthat no party would risk peace for\nparty political reasons.\nEnts DJ Luke Moralis have put\nforward their candidacies. Only\nEric Allsop has the requisite support in the bag: Luke needs further second ers names, while\nMark Bridge, who signed up on\nMonday February 5th, is still\nhunting for a proposer.\nTim Townend, the current\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties) commented: \"It looks\nlike it's all going to be very boring\nthis year.\"\nUnion officials are also concerned that the elections will see\na very low turnout of voters when\nthey are held on March 4th and\n5th. Students must be in posse-Sir Patrick became uncomfortable only once during the\nquestioning, looking agitated on\nthe subject of last Friday's bomb\nat Canary Wharf. A member of\nthe audience asked whether he\nthought that the leadership of\nSinn Fein had prior knowledge of\nthe docklands bombing. Sir\nPatrick replied he was \"unable to\nanswer that\", since the leadership\nthemselves were the ones to ask.\nWhen pressed for his own op in ions, he stated firmly: \"I don't want to share my personal view.\"\nHe instead reminded the\naudience of a widely reported\nincident last year, when the Sinn\nFein president Gerry Adams was\naddressing a party rally, and\nresponded to a shout from the\ncrowd of \"Bring back the IRA\"\nwith \"They haven't gone away,\nyou know.\" One member of the\naudience took exception to this,\nshouting out: \"That was out of\ncontext and you know it.\" Sir\nPatrick replied staunchly:\n\"Perhaps the context was the\ncontext of last Friday.\"\nThe gathering ended on a note of mild confusion. As the\naudience prepared to leave, a member of the Conservative\nSociety informed the minister\nthat a bottle of whisky adjacent\nto the podium, which he had\nassumed to be a gift, was merely\nto be autographed and returned.\nboring\"\nsion of a valid IC Union card to\nbe eligible to vote, but little more\nthan 50% of students have one.\nIn recent years, the Imperial\nCollege Union membership ID\ncame as part of the college security swipe card, so every student\nwas automatically issued with\none. Separate ICU membership\ncards have been issued this year\nin an attempt to remove some of\nthe technical problems associated\nwith using magnetic swipe cards\nto register votes.\nThe 'new election' campaign\nwill be run by the current Deputy\nPresidents. The position is open\nfor all posts.\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS FEATURE\nFELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 1 6TH1996. TWENTY-FIVE\nLETTER TO ICU: REPLIED TO BY ICU STAFF\nDear ICU, The propaganda accompanying\nthe calls lor comments about the\nUnion in recent issues of Felix\nwere very reassuring - how nice\nto see a body so concerned with\nthe welfare of students, providing\nservices at affordable prices and\nan unmissable Ents. programme.\nWhat a shame that they did not\npaint a fully balanced picture.\nWhen compared to those of\nother universities, such as\nManchester, Cardiff and Birmingham, the facilities in our union\nare extremely poor. While\nImperial may be a relatively small\nuniversity, the union does not\nmatch up even to that of similar\nsized universities, such as Hull. I fully agree with Rachel Walters'\ncomments in the editorial of Jan.\n19th on the state of the union's facilities, while the proportion of\nstudents regularly using the\nbuilding in the evenings may be\nquite low, a capacity of around\n500 on most nights hardly\nenables access for all, as demonstrated by the queues regularly\nseen outside the Quad. I am\naware that this capacity is being\nslightly increased, but this will do\nlittle to ease the frustration of\npeople having to wait outside.\nSuch frustration is not calmed by\nthe holier-than-thou and generally arrogant attitude displayed by\nthe majority of Stewards.\nThe union is the only one I know of (and I have visited\naround thirty different unions in\nthe past couple of years) not to\nhave any pool tables available.\nThe bar facilities arc undeniably\ninadequate for their purpose. It is\nquite unbelievable that we should\nhave two small bar areas, even\nwith the seating in Da Vinci's being inconveniently removed,\nboth of which are served by\ninsufficient bar length and staff.\nPerhaps more frustrating to most\npeople is the service offered at\nthe bars and food counters. There\nseems to be some inability to\nkeep all the beers in the Union\nBar on tap throughout a week,\nnot to mention at the right temperature (and water content, it\nseems?]. I cannot understand\nwhy the bar continues to sell cigarettes but no cigars, despite\nrepeated requests made to the\nstaff - I know of many people\nwho would enjoy such a service.\nThe bars' shortcomings really pale into insignificance when\none considers the Da Vinci's food\ncounters. Quite apart from the\nfood itself, which is, at best,\nsomewhat like the curate's egg, it\nis the running of the outlet that is\ninfuriating. It is all too frequent\nfor certain foods to run out even\nby l pm, especially potatoes and\nbread. What use is this to a student arriving for his lunch from a humanities lecture or meeting? I feel I need not answer that. One\nor two of the staff are completely obnoxious to all customers, an\nimage that people will be left\nwith when they think about Da\nVinci's. Furthermore, a senior\nmember of staff blatantly lied to\nme about signs up in Da Vinci's falsely stating the availability of\nfood at different times of the\nday. He promised me personally\nthat he would change them -three months on there has been\nno action, what are people supposed to think when senior members of staff lie while giving off an\nimage of sincere regret?\nThese grumbles apart, the\nunion does provide a reasonable\nservice. Events such as Welfare\nWeek do have limited effect\nwithin the college community\n(not necessarily a fault of the\nunion or its officers), but research needs to be done to find\nways of increasing the knowledge\nof and participation in such\nevents. Perhaps it may be easier\nfor the union to interact with the\ngeneral student community with\nthe greater presence of staff on\nthe reception desk, providing a much needed break from the\nprevious miserable, grudging service that greeted visitors. To con-clude: the union is doing well,\nbut could do much better on the\nfronts mentioned above. And without forward planning (which\nappears to be lacking at present),\nthe union will be unable to cater\nfor future needs.\nYours sincerely,\nChris Bragg Physics 3\nUnion Staff:\nSadly we have to agree with Chris\nBragg's comments on the level and\nquality of services and environment\nat ICU when compared with those\nof other major institutions.\nUnfortunately IC was late in recognising the necessity of such develop-ment s. Many of the other colleges\nhad started investing time and\nmoney into student services back in\nthe early eighties. Long term planning in student unions is crucial to\nstudents to give three major benefits:\n1. The satisfaction and welfare of\nstudents who use and run the ser-vices.\n2. The ability through such services\nto attract future students when coin-petition between colleges is tough.\n3. The generation of income through\nwell-used services to enable the\nUnion to have autonomy in future\ngrowth and development of all\naspects of commercial and non-com-mercia l services (from clubs and\nsocieties to welfare, student develop-ment, etc.)\nOver the past few years we have\nstarted to redress the balance. Da\nVinci's was totally refurbished, toilets were replaced, the Union\nOffices were moved to a more central, approachable position, the\nBookstore was completely refitted\nand the Newsagents was developed.\nThere are plans for a major\ndevelopment of the entertainment\nvenue and bar/food areas. We have\nhad to put some of these on hold\nwhile we are uncertain of our permanent location. We do, however,\nrecognise that the Union cannot\nstand still until decisions are taken\nabout its future. We are currently\nlooking into a relatively small scale\ndevelopment which would at least\nimprove the environment in the short\nterm.\nComments like those from\nChris are very welcome. They show\nus that in fighting for improved student services and facilities we are\ntruly representing student opinion.\nIC students, both present and\nfuture, deserve facilities at least as\ngood as those of any other university\nin the country, and we will get there.\nWe were disappointed with the\nlack of response to the Felix appeal.\nWe need your input to make this the\nUnion that you want il to be.\nEnts manager:\nQueuing is as a result of the\nincreased demand for the services\noffered on a Friday night. The actual\ncapacity for the union on a normal\nFriday night is 750, which compares\nfavourably in relation to other\nLondon colleges. This increases to\n1200 on carnivals. As events become\nmore popular, we have tried to\ninform people of the need to arrive\nearly. If people are unable to get in,\nthis because we have to observe legal\nfire limits.\nOur non-operation of a one-in\none-out policy is a result of discussion with local residents, fire authorities and police. We have to carefully\nobserve it, as any problems caused\noutside Beit could result in the loss\nof our licence.\nBar Manager:\nThe suppliers of pool tables, as well\nas insurers, require that they are\npositioned in full view of a member\nof staff all the time: with our restricted space, this could be very difficult.\nEverybody would agree we should\nhave more space, both in front of\nand behind the bar.\nThe keeping of cask ales can be\na tricky business. One of the most\nimportant requirements is clean li ness. To ensure all ales are served in\ntop quality condition, the lines must\nbe cleaned regularly. Sometimes this\nmay lead to a specific brand not\nbeing available for a short time.\nWe endeavour to offer a varied\nselection of traditional ales: although\nwe have nine hand pumps, we have\noffered in excess of thirty different\nales in recent months. This inevitably\nmeans that certain ales are not available at all times. We always endeavour to serve only quality products,\nbut if a customer is not satisfied they\nwill always be offered an alternative.\nCigars will be available behind the\nbar in the very near future.\nCatering manager:\nI put signs up 48 hours after speaking to you, and they were continually ripped down and replaced. I got\nfed up with this behaviour, but I should have thought of an alternative. Sorry. Food running out is\nunfortunate, but we inevitably have\nit happening a certain amount in\nattempts to avoid wastage.\n\n"
