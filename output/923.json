    "content": "Reviews Felix 923 24 January 1992\nJFK\u2014the story that won't go away\nOn November 22 1963 the United\nStates of America was to be forever\nchanged as a nation. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy placed this country on a path toward other events\u2014which\nwould, in turn, shake the very\nfoundation of American society and\nforever alter the way they look at\ntheir government and at each other.\nJFK chronicles Jim Garrison's investigation into the\nassassination\u2014as district attorney of\nNew Orleans\u2014and the prosecution\nof New Orleans businessman Clay\nShaw for conspiracy in the murder.\nThe film also utilise s public sources\nand other information which has\nsurfaced in the past two decades.\nThe film is not simply Garrison's story, Garrison is used, rather, as\na protagonist to enable Stone to\npresent the mountain of information\nwhich he and his research staff\ndiscovered surrounding the\nKennedy assassination.\nJim Garrison, as a prosecutor,\nsought above all to know how, by\nwhom and why John F. Kennedy\nwas murdered. To academy award\nwinner Oliver Stone, the question\nwas not who?\u2014but, why? The\nmalaise, the unease, the\ndisillusionment, the cynicism.\nFuelled by one of the strongest\ncasts any film has ever seen,\nincluding Kevin Costner, Sissy\nSpacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe\nPe sci, Gary Oldman, Jack\nLemmon, Kevin Bacon, John\nCandy( and many more\ndistinguished actors accounting for\nabout 40 academy award nominees\nand twenty oscars). Oliver Stone\ngives us what appears to be the most\nup-to-date, thro roughly researched\n'documentary' of the events\nfollowing the president's death. He\nhas produced a film that is bound\nto shock many people, the film has\nalready had plenty of criticism\nStateside, I think, mainly because\nthe truths it tells are scar i ly realistic\nand are truths, all the facts\npresented are 100%.\nJFK is a long film\u2014over three\nhours in fact, a lot of this time is\nspent presenting facts, albeit in a dramatic way, this may seem\ndaunting but is unfortunately\nnecessary.\nTechnically the film is superb, as\none would expect considering the\ntalent involved, but it won't be to\neverybody's taste, it's basically a why-dunn it rather than a who-dunn it, which shows how naive the\nAmerican people have been, and it\nwill undoubtedly cause some\nunwanted and rather large ripples.\nA moving, compelling and very\nworrying film\u2014not to be missed\neven if you hate it, you'll learn a lot. Kevin Costner delivers another\naward winning performance. (God\nknows what he'll be doing for an\nencore). It's raining oscars out there\nand th fs film has the largest net with\nthe smallest holes.\nPoo.\nBlame it\nDudley Moore has been absent\nfrom the film scene for quite some\ntime\u2014his last few forays being none\ntoo memorable. So it comes to pass\nthat Dudley Moore makes a welcome comeback, leading a strong cast into this comic tale of\nmistaken identity. Anyway, on with\nthe story...\nPicture the scene, Venice in\non the\nspring, now let us concentrate on\nthree English gen tel men booking\ninto the Hotel Gabrielli: Mr Orton,\nMr Horton and Mr Lawton. Now if you know an Italian (my Dad) you\nwill realise this spells disaster, for\nthe harassed Italian bellboy\n(Bronson Pinchot) it's worse, and\nfor the disparate souls with the\nsimilar sounding names, it is no less\na catastrophe.\nMelvyn Orton (Dudley Moore) is\nthe mild mannered clerk sent by his\nbully of a boss to supervise the\npurchase of a villa. Maurice Horton\n(Richard Griffiths), a middle aged\nlothar io eager for the heady\nBellboy\nromantic promise of Medi-Date.\nMr Lawton (Bryan Brown), in\nreality Mr Charlton Black, is a professional hit man in Venice to\nkill person or persons unknown.\nWhile events conspire to confuse\neveryone utterly, people other than\nOrton, Horton and Lawton become\nwittingly and unwittingly involved.\nThe Mafia boss Scarpa (Andreas\nKatsmas) and his henchmen; the\nbeautiful and ambitious estate agent\nCaroline (Patsy Kensit), love\nhungry Patricia (Penelope Wilton)\nand Maurice's wife Rosemary\n(Alison Steadman).\nThe bellboy does his very best to\noblige the assembled company but\nthe result is a degree of confusion\nseldom eclipsed.\nForget your Terminators and\nyour Robin Hoods, this is a film I most strongly recommend, it had\nme in tears, constantly on the edge\nof my seat, this is a comedy unlike\nany other. Seldom do you go to a cinema and witness the clapping of\nhands as I did here. I haven't given\nmuch away\u2014it would be unfair to.\nA completely original story and\nsome hilariously convincing acting,\nwill make this one of the funniest\nfilms of the year\u2014roll on good of British humour.\nPoo.\n10\u2014\n\n"

Given time the\ncrowd would probably have\ndrowned him but their hosing was\ncut short by a spirited fanfare.

    "content": "24 January 1992 Felix 923 Reviews\nLittle Man Tate\nLittle Man Tate is Jodie Foster's( or\nshould that be the Oscar-WinningActress-Jodie-Foster's) directorial\ndebut, the modern-day fairy tale of\na stupendously gifted child (what\nelse?) prodigy.\nFred Tate (Adam Hann-Byrd)\ncould read at one. write poetry at\nfour, and now he's wont to vent\ndeep profundities about van Gogh.\nHe plays the piano brilliantly, he\nevaluates fluid dynamics in his head\n(well, nearly), and all the rest, but\n- and here's the sting - he doesn't have any friends. After a succession\nof increasingly miserable\nexperiences in the working-class\nneighbourhood where he Hves, a small ray of hope arrives in the\nform of Jane Grierson, a child\npsychologist of some repute, who\nwants to take Fred away and teach\nhim about Sunflowers. Foster plays\nDede, Fred's mother, a great but\nrestricted mother; she has her own\nvery definite ideas on how Fred\nshould be brought up. Jane takes\nFred off to a brain farm, where he\ngets a chance to exercise his skills\nmore 'usefully', an arrangement\nDede is not happy with. Thus the\nseeds of conflict and tension are\nsown, ready to explode into full-scale dramatic upheaval.\nWhile you could safely say that\nnot very much happens in this film,\nthat's not necessarily a bad thing.\nThe story unfolds gradually,\nconcentrating on Fred' s elation ships with his mother ano\nlane, clearly a topic with strong\nautobiographical resonances for\nFoster, herself presumably subject\nlo conflicting influences in her time\nas a child star. As a directorial\ndebut it's a relaxed slide into the\njob. competent but hardly on the\ncutting edge. Someone else easing\ngradually into a new role is Harry\nConnick Jr.. who makes a short\nappearance as a smooth young\n(hey!) musician. Not exactly\nstretching his ability, but he does it\nadequately. Adam Hann-Byrd is\ngood as Fred, thankfully having\nmore acting ability than cute\nmuppet ness( stand up. Macaulay\nCulkin) and Foster herself puts her\nusual understated skill into her\nperformance.\nSooo...L/ ff/e Man Tate has\nenough going for it to hold the\nattention quite firmly for the\nrequisite amount of time, but it's not\ngoing to win any awards. Never\nmind, it's quite enjoyable anyway.\nYou certainly won't be wasting\nyour time (cf. Don't Tell Her It's Me).\nThe Oldest Child Prodigy\nGerbil In The World\nDon't Tell Her It's Me\nIf I met this film in the street I wouldn't give it the time of day. In\nfact. I'd probably cross the road to\navoid it. And so should you.\nSince that's not going to fill four\nhundred words, I'd better say a little\nmore. Gus (Steve Guttenberg) has\njust recovered from a serious illness\nand wants to get some action. The\nproblem is that he's, like, a rill yr illy sweet guy, y' know, but\ny 'know, he's bald an' all, and he\ndoesn't know too much about girls..\nFortunately, his sister Lizzie( Shelley Long) is a successful\nromance novelist and knows\neverything there is to know on the\nsubject; but when she introduces\nGus to Emily, a journalist of her\nacquaintance , things don't go well,\neither for Gus or for the audience.\nSo together the siblings concoct a patently ludicrous alter ego, a biker\nnamed (snigger) Lobo, who hails\nfrom New Zealand, to win Emily's heart.\nThere ensues much 'George And Mildred' style farce and mistaken\nidentity hi jinks, only without the\nvicar and substantially less flowing\nwith humour. Emily and Gus run\ninto each other around town at\ninopportune moments, involving a number of painfully unfunny scenes\nand about the same number of\nimplausibilities so vast that even\nGuttenberg cannot bridge them for\nall his comic talent. I'm not going\nto give any details. You don't need\nthem. Trust me.\nAt the end of it all, Gus is found\nout (no surprise there, then), Emily\ndecides she loves him anyway, after\na few token words about\nmanipulation and everything draws\nto an unrealistic and unsatisfying\nclose.\nDon'f Tell Her It's Me has a terrible plot, doesn't seem able to\ndifferentiate between a wacky\ncomedy of errors and Dying\nYoung, is about as entertaining as\nwatching a dead sheep bloat and is\nthe kind of film that makes you\ncreep around in the dead of night\nwith the horrible sensation that you\nhave completely wasted two hours\nof your life.\nI didn't like it.\nA Gerbil In Bloated Sheep's Clothing\n\n"

    "content": "24 January 1992 Felix 923 Feature\nGrease is the biggest musical\nproject to hit Imperial College for\nmany, many years. It is the product\nof over six months of planning,\nproduction and rehearsal by a small\nteam of members and ex-members\nof IC DramSoc and OpSoc. The\nidea of staging Grease came to the\nproducers, Richard Harrison and\nDerek Hirst, last summer whilst in\na drunken stupor in the Union Bar\nand not through any personal\nadmiration for Olivia Newton-John\n(or John Travolta).\nAlthough both DramSoc and\nOpSoc have never produced a project on this scale before, limiting\nthemselves to small-scale College\nproductions and touring every\nsummer to the Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival, the idea soon became a firm proposal. By early last term,\nthe project received firm financial\nbacking from ICU, the three CC Us and the Rector of the College.\nMany people accuse Imperial\nstudents of a lack of creativity and\na general apathy towards the Arts,\nbut the directors, Philip Hollman\nand Joanna Tripp, were astonished\nby the response to the\nadvertisements for auditions and the\nenthusiasm for performing shown\nby the people that turned up. The\nauditions took place in mid-October\nfor a chance to perform in one of\nmore than the forty places on offer.\nThe directors eventually decided\nthat the roles of Sandy, the lead\nfemale, and Rizzo were both to be\nfilled by students from the Royal\nCollege of Music, but almost all of\nthe rest of the cast (including the\ncast was not the only difficulty\nfaced in this production. The\nproduction crew faced the prospect\nof building a theatre within the\nGreat Hall, which has a stage that\n'is wider than most West End\ntheatres. Not only that, if you've\nnoticed any bedrooms being moved\nThe making of 'Grease'\nlead male, Danny) consist of\nImperial students. What talent\nwould have lain undiscovered if it\nwere not for Grease?\nSince November, every Monday,\nTuesday and Sunday have seen over\nfifty cast and production crew\nassemble in the rehearsal studio to\npiece together the complex dance\nroutines and music necessary to\nmake a musical on this scale work.\nCombining forty singing voices,\ndancing and a live band, proved to\n.be \"quite a task for the\nchoreographers, Virginia King and\nLyanna Iveson, but the hard work\nand dedication needed to get the cast\nto move in the right direction and\nat the right time has paid off.\nThe direction of the forty-odd\ninto the Great Hall today, it's us -we've got to transform a bare\norchestral venue into a theatre in\nonly three days.\nSo. you've read about it - now\ncome and see it! The production\nruns from Tuesday 28th January to\nSaturday 1st February at 7.30pm every evening. Tickets are available\nnow but be quick because they are\nselling very fast - buy one from the\nIC Union office or any of the C CU offices, or direct from us on the\nSherfield walkway level at\nlunchtimes. For those of you not\nnear college, buy one from the\nUL U ticket office at Malet Street\n(subject to booking fee) or come\nalong - tickets will be available on\nthe night if there are any left.\nThe sweat,\nblood and tears,\nthe pain and\npassion in the\nexhibition of the\nsoul\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies Felix 923 24 January 1992\nGliding over Hampshire Pak Soc*^ IC Pakistan Society is di It's freezing, blowing a gale and\nthreatening to rain. And to think I could have been tucked up in bed\nwith a mince pie and a bottle of\nwhisky. I must be mad - or\ndedicated because I was on the\nImperial College gliding club New Year course, held at the Lasham\ngliding centre in Hampshire. The\naim was to fly as much as possible\nover the space of5 days, which is\nthe best way to begin when learning\nto glide.\nThe weather cleared up for the\nfirst few days, enabling us to fly.\nAfter a breakfast of scrambled eggs\nand gallons of tea in the clubhouse,\nthe hanger doors were opened and\nthe sleek fibreglass gliders wheeled\nout. IC gliding club owns three of\nthese machines, including the new\ntwo seater in which we do most of\nour training before graduating onto\n'hot' single seaters.\nBefore the glider is flown it is\nthoroughly checked to see if it is\nairworthy, and that no mice have\nmade their new home (this has\nhappened before). We then towed\nthe glider to the launch point,\ndonned parachutes, and ran through\npre-takeoff checks. Then launch,\neither by winch or by taking a tow\nfrom another aeroplane. After\nreleasing the towing cable the noise\nlevel dies down and you admire the\nspectacular view. It's now easy to\nsee why gliding is such a compulsive sport. After practising\nturns, spins and stalls it's time to\nland.\nIn the summer, flights can be\nextended by using thermal\nup currents but winter is an ideal\ntime for training because the airfield\nis not busy. The instructors who\nflew in the back seat are all ex IC students, and are suitably qualified\nand have yet to crack under the\ntension of teaching present day\nstudents to fly.\nIn the evening much beer (and\nSouthern Comfort, eh Rob?) was\nconsumed at the New Year's party.\nOther excursions during the\nevenings involved trips to the local\npub, which is usually full of glider\npilots unwinding (not a pretty\nsight). Great fun was had by\nchasing rabbits across the airfield on\nthe way back from the pub. Why do\nthey freeze in your headlights?\nDuring the course we stayed in the\nclub's bunkhouse - a palatial\nresidence dating from WorldWar II, and with more furry friends for\ncompany.\nThe weather got worse at the end\nof the week, but not before we had\ngot a lot of flying done.

In\ntheir first game the Slappers\npaddled out to a standing ovation,\neager to play the Royal Vets. An unprecedented commotion ensued\nfrom the off and with awesome skill\nand impressive technique the Vets\ndemonstrated their total mastery of the sport in what turned out to be\nan even contest - men in tune with\ntheir canoes. We won 6-0.\nOur second game was against\nLSE. Another frenzied foray\nwhipped the pool into a mass of\nfoam as the teams duelled\nunrelentingly. Despite all our\nattempts we were forced to score a fine goal just before the interval.\nThe second half was another close\nbattle; finally the crowd were\nstunned into silence as LSE shot an\nequalise r rightly disallowed by the\nreferee (a fine upstanding man). In\nthe end we had to concede yet\nanother surprise victory, winning\n1-0.\nThe on looking teams were\nnaturally stunned by the display of our teetotal team, who had already\nbegun their strict training schedule\nfor the January fixtures. Fortunately\nthis meant the losing teams could\ndrown their sorrows appropriately.\nJ Kent, Biology III.\nIC Pakistan Society is proud to\npresent a talk by Abdul Wajid this\nevening (Friday, 24th January) at\n5.30pm in the Concert Hall, entitled\n'Asian: Born to be Brown'. Mr Wajid will be discussing the\ndifficulties of identity crisis that face\nmany young Asians who are born\nboth in the Asian Sub-Continent and\nin the UK. Is it a personality\nproblem when it is difficult to adapt\nto the surroundings, especially\nwhen massive cultural difference\nexists?\nIs there actually such a thing as\nan Asian identity? After all, can\nHindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and\nMuslims live together and strive to\nsolve their communal strife? Mr Wajid will be putting forward an\nIslamic approach as the\ncomprehensive solution to these\nproblems. So if you are interested\nwhy not come along!\nGreen\nJonathon Porritt, an inspirational\nleader of the Green Movement and\nformer director of the Friends of the\nEarth, will be discussing various\nenvironmental issues this Tuesday\n(28th).

Raising taxes to\ncontrol demand was the '60s and\n'70s answer. It failed. It did not go\nto the heart of the problem of excess\nmoney growth, and it tremendous\nlong term damage to our economy,\nharming incentive and inhibiting\nenterprise. That was Labour's legacy.\nUnderlying strength\nachievements.\nthe '80s On the Record\nRichard\nForeman, IC\nConsoc ViceChairman, in\nresponse to last\nweek's Labour\nopinion.\nJohn Major, Prime Minister.\nto re-surface (although to nowhere\nnear the catastrophic 27% of the last\nLabour Government). The\nGovernment acted decisively to\nbring inflation back down to\nGerman levels through the only\neffective mechanism - increasing\ninterest rates. Industry needed a cure for inflation. But industry itself\nwas affected by the cure applied.\nMany businesses moved to take\nadvantage of the expanding market\nand borrowed heavily for' investment in the late 1980s, and\nwere therefore hit by high interest\nrates. Low order books and cash\nflow difficulties added to the pain,\nand business failures had risen as a result. Other businesses have had to\ncut back sharply and none of this is\nin the least bit welcome.\nBut we cannot pretend that it\ncould have been avoided. Credit\ncontrols are unworkable in our open\nfinancial markets. Reserve asset\nRecession, however, does not mean\nthat British business is weak. The\n1980s saw a dramatic\ntransformation during which productivity soared (outstripping\neven Japan), and investment grew\nfaster than in any major\nindustrialised country outside\nJapan. Corporation Tax was cut\nfrom Labour's52p to 33p in the\npound (and from 42% to 25% for\nsmall companies).\nNearly two-thirds of the\nnationalised sector has been brought\ninto private ownership, helping the\ndisciplines and competitive instincts\nof private enterprise to transform\nthe culture and performance of\nmany of our most important\ncompanies. British Steel, for\nexample, is now ranked as one of\nthe most efficient steel producers in\nthe world, while it was once in the\nGuinness Book of Records as the\nnumber one loss maker!\nA recent German study of best\nperforming companies in Europe\nshowed an extraordinary British\npre-eminence. Of the best 50\ncompanies in Europe, no less than\n27 were British, while the French\nhad 3, the Germans 4, and nobody\nelse had more than three. And this\nsuccess - this outstanding success -was not restricted to one or two.\nsectors or to services; according to\nthe research, 6 out of the 10 top\nperforming companies in\nmanufacturing and engineering are\nBritish, 5 out of 10 in paper, print\nand publishing, 4 out of 10 in\nchemical and life sciences. 5 in\ntechnology and communications, 2\nin mining and metals and 7 in\nproperty and construction - a fairly\nimpressive all round performance.\nNone of this has necessarily made\nthe recession easier to bear, but the\nunderlying strength of British\nbusiness shows that the industrial\npolicy pursued by this Government,\nwas the right one; and as a result,\nforeign businesses are continuing to\ninvest far more in Britain than in\nany other EC country. In recent\nyears, Britain has managed to\nattract more than 40% of all inward\ninvestment flows in the EC nearly\nthree times more than France and\nsix times more than Germany. We now export more per head of\npopulation than either the USA or\nJapan.\nBy comparison, under Labour we\nwere known as 'the sick man of\nEurope\", and notorious examples of\ninefficient companies, propped up\nwith subsidy, were laughed about\nat home and abroad.\nRecovery\nBritain is ahead of the world\neconomic cycle. The economy is\nback on track, and the recession has\nbottomed out. We are in a strong\nposition to take advantage of\ne ono mic upturn. That is greeted as\ngood news by everyone except\nLabour.

We have\nwon more Nobel Prizes in science\nthan any other country except the\nUSA three times as many as\nFrance and fourteen times as many\nas Japan. The challenges are to feed\nthat achievement through into\ncommercial development. We all\nseem to share the same aims. Of course the Government can help\nfund R&D where the commercial\nPeter Lilley, Secretary of State\nfor Trade and Industry.\nbenefits may be too long term or\ninsecure to attract the necessary\nmoney from private backers- pure\nor 'pre-competitive' research as it\nis called. The Government spends\nsome \u00a3 3 billion a year on civil\nresearch and development. That is\na higher proportion of national\nincome than the Japanese\nGovernment spends.\nThere are D TI research agencies\n(eg the National Physical Laboratory) and a number of\nimportant programmes, such as\ngrants for developing new products,\nor technology transfer campaigns.\nThe most successful economies,\neg. Japan and Germany, are not the\nones where Government spending\non R&D is particularly high. We must guard against the notion that\nGovernment can make Britain\ncompetitive, and here Britain's poor\nrecord from out past 'corpora ti st' days is improving steadily. What is\nneeded is a cultural revolution,\ntransforming the educational and\nsocial bias against practical skills.\nAnd good, healthy profits (not over\ntaxed), so that business have the\nmoney to invest.\nThe idea that the state knows\nbest, and can 'pick winners' worthy\nof investment (at the tax-payer's expense) is unrealistic. The Conservative party has too close a contact with the real world of business to go for unrealistic and\ndamaging attempts at\ninterventional is m. The thought of\nLabour's shadow cabinet deciding\nhow businesses should be managed,\nwhen not one of them has personal\nbusiness experience, is frankly\nlaughable. Or worrying.\n'1 i ail ling\nIt is vital that the Government\nworks closely with business, rather\nthan throwing programmes at them.\nWe do not agree with Labour's policy of forcing companies, using\ntheir Jobs Tax as a whip. The\nConservatives do not agree with\nLabour's bureaucratic nightmare of\ncouncils and commissions and\nquangos and regulations - all of which require something of business, sapping their sources.\nInstead, the Tories are giving\nbusinesses themselves more power\nto control resources available to\nthem at local level, through\nTraining and Enterprise Councils,\nregional D TI business service\ncentres, and partnership with the\nChambers of Commerce to deliver\na number of export and other\nservices. Many companies seized\non the range of overseas trade\nservices for British businesses,\nincluding the provision of export\nintelligence, counselling, sponsored\nmissions and export credit.\nEnvironmental Protection\nSimilarly for the environment,\nthe Government must look to assist,\nand encourage measures to clean up\nindustrial processes. Environmental\nprotection legislation is being\nintroduced at a steady rate, backed\nup by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of\nPollution, and new bodies with real\nteeth such as the National Rivers\nAuthority. The Tories have given\nBritain Europe's first system of integrated pollution control. The\nGreen Party, by comparison view\neconomic growth as a futile goal.\nAlso Labour's commitment to\nstabilise CO, output at present\nlevels by the year 2000 is totally\nincompatible with their stated aim\nof replacing Nuclear Power with\nincreased reliance on coal.\nThe Future Labour's burdens on\nbusiness would include a cobweb of\nred tape; a cumbersome training\nbureaucracy and a costly and\ninflationary minimum wage which\nwould drive many more companies\nto the wall.\nInterest rates must fall as quickly\nas is prudently possible.

No more\nshelling of places like Vukovar,\nGospich and the holiday resort of\nDubrovnik. No more Croats\nstarving and no more of them\nmassacred by the Serb- dominated\nFederal Army. It's a great step\nforward for democracy.\nBut it isn't. The Western Media\nhas hoodwinked the people of\nBritain by biassed reporting, i.e. from the Croatian side. The Press\nnever mentioned the 200,000\nSerbiann refugees who have fled\nfrom Croatia into neighbouring\nSerbia and Bosnia, for fear of\npersecution, thereby losing their\nland and possessions. What about\nthe Serbs who have been killed\ninthe most vile ways by Croatian\nNeo-Fascists? After all, this present\nconflict can be seen to have begun\nin the Spring of 1991 when a band\nof Croats decided to murder some\nSerbs, like the 'good old days,' in\nan area near Plitvitce National Park,\nEastern Croatia. They sang Ustasa\nsongs, a hark back to the Fascist\ndays of Croatian history when\nhundreds of thousands of Serbs\nwere massacred. Indeed, without\nconsulting the rest of the Yugoslav\nFederation, Croatia declared its\nindependence overnight and now is\ntaking away more land than that\nwith which it had when it joined\nYugoslavia in 1918.\nLet me get things straight. This\ncivil war is not just about the\nsecession of Croatia (it has a perfect\nlegal right to do so, but only in\naccordance with the laws of\nYugoslavia) but about the protection\nof Serbian minority in Croatia.\nWith the help of Italy, Austria and\nGermany, a Fascist state of Croatia\nwas formed in 1941, led by a bloodthirsty man called Pavelich.\nImmediately, he began to massacre\nSerbs (and Jews and Gypsies)\nwholesale, even extracting their\neyes as trophies, and for this he got\nrecognition of his Catholic State by\nthe Vatican.\nAfter the War, these crimes were\ncovered up by Tito, a Croat\nhimself, and to debilitate the Serbs\neven more, he took away parts of\ntheir land and gave it to Croatia,\ne.g. Slavonia. This is why there is\nnow approximately 600,000 Serbs\nliving in the Eastern lands of\nCroatia.\nIf they get massacred again,\nwhose fault will it be? Surely the\nE.C.' s for recognising an illegally\nindependent country.\nSimon Petrovich.\nRoll Over\nDear Adam,\nHaving read the notice in the\nUnion Snack-Bar, explaining that\nwe are not allowed to eat packed\nlunches in there between 12 and\n2pm, I feel compelled to write and\ncomplain.\nOf course, I understand that\npeople who buy food in the snack-bar should be entitled to a seat, but\nit's not exactly as if the place has\nbeen over-run with picnickers\ncomplete with thermos flasks and\ntartan rugs.\nThis is typical of the Unioninstead of addressing the more\nfundamental issues such as welfare\nor housing, the sabbaticals seem to\nspend their time hiding in their\noffices or devising schemes such\nthat anyone who cannot afford to\nbuy food from the snack-bar is\nbanished to the lounge to eat a solitary lunch.\nAnyway, I'd like to see how the\nUnion will enforce this rule; I can't imagine a16 stone, 6 foot rugby\nplayer meekly retiring to the Ents.\nLounge on the command of an\nineffectual sabbatical.\nPlease do not print my name, as\nI do not want to be confused with\nthose pathetic individuals who start\nbombarding Felix with letters at this\ntime of year as an early sabbatical\nelection campaign.\nName withheld by request.\nP.S. Before I get any indignant\nreplies from the current s abs, remember de aries you only have\nhalf of the year left to start doing\nsomething about your unfulfilled\nmanifesto promises from last year.\nDear Adam,\nIn Felix on the 10th January you\npublished a letter from Mr/Miss\nL.G. Maskall entitled 'Mindless\nWaffle', in which Christians are\naccused of writing 'narrow minded'\narticles.\nChristianity is not based upon the\ncreation story presented in the book\nof Genesis, nor on the belief that\nGod hands out petty punishment for\nforgetting to say one's prayers. As\nthe writer of the a fore mentioned\nletter is him/herself unable to accept\nany grounds for the importance or\nrelevance of the Genesis story, I would hope that (s) he, and others\nof similar mind might realise and\nrespect the broad mindedness of\nsomeone who is able to. regardless\nof the 'eve den ce' against. Indeed,\none has to have a broad mind to\naccept much of the Bible.\nI find it interesting to read that\n'when one looks at the world\naround us. it's obvious He's a total\nbloody sadist\". Sadism is (sadly) a human quality, and a closer look at\nthe world clearly shows that all too\naf ten it is the work of mankind that\nis to blame for suffering.\nYours sincerely.\nTrevor Addenbrooke.

How\ndo you make a dead elephant float?\nOne scoop of ice-cream and one\ndead elephant.\nOld joke, yes we know, but isn't that what IC is all about? I mean I could name a few old jokes around\nhere.

I mean such a classic move\nof the check mating on Clayponds\nwith the bishop or was it the\nRector?\nAny how, what's this we hear\nabout MSF strikes, 3am Eternal\nwas rather a good track if you ask\nme even if that Poddy ge zz er doesn't think so. Mind you does he\nlike anything? Ice cream perhaps\n(well we had to get it in somewhere\ndidn't we and all the other holes\nwere filled up).

The duty officers claimed that\na dispute evolved during which the\ndrunk Mr Farrant told them that\nthey would not be re-employed as\nduty officers and that the incident\nwould adversely affect the chances\nof election of one of them in the\napproaching sabbatical elections.\nMs Zoe Hel linger. Union President, spoke to College student\nmedia on Tuesday defending Mr Farrant's position. Ms Hellinger\nsaid the affair was not conduct that\nwould lead to a disciplinary\ncommittee' but it was more serious\nthan if a student had done it.\nMs Hellinger continued that Mr Farrant would not be able to carry\nout any of the threats he is said to\nhave made. She also commented\nthat duty officers should not discuss\nevents which occured during duty\nas confidentiality was part of their\ncontract.\nMr Farrant told Felix that he\ncould not remember what happened\nbut that he was 'very drunk' and\nhad apologised to the people\nconcerned. He said that he did not\nwant to resign but that being\nHonorary Secretary 'was not the job\nI stood for.'\nA meeting of the Union Executive called to consider the\nissue yesterday resolved that Mr Farrant was 'out of order' and he\nhad 'no power' to carry out any\nthreats he had made. The executive\nalso said that, in their view, the 24\nhour ban was sufficient punishment\nas no other misconduct had\noccurred.\nSorry Goo'dAll Bye\nFelix is smaller than usual this\nweek, and of variable printing\nquality, due to a series of production problems. This includes\none member of staff being ill, the\nother being on holiday and the\nreplacement printer trying to find\nsomewhere to live.

Many\napologies - you've got to laugh\nhaven't you.\nMr Ramesh Patel. assistant union\nbur manager, has resigned after\nworking for the Union for about six\nmonths. Mr Patel offered his\nresignation for personal reasons and\nwill become bar manager at the\nRoyal College of Art. near the\nAlbert Hall.\nThe Union will be advertising the\njob to outside applicants and Mr Patel's resignation will take effect\nfrom the 28th January.\nLibrary Fines\nThe College Library are starting to\nenforce fines on all overdue books\nand recordings. The fines will be 25\npence a day on books and 10 pence\na week for recordings. All restricted\nloans will be charged at 20 pence\nan hour, and overnight loans at 25\npence per day overdue. An additional charge of \u00a31 will be made\non extremely overdue items.\nAnyone with overdue books or\nunpaid fines will not be allowed to\nremove items from the libraries.\nMr Richard Halls. Reader\nService Librarian, said that fines\nhave been in regulations since 1989\nand students using the library had\nbeen informed of them. Mr Halls\nadded that the regulations were now\nbeing enforced due to the fact that\nover a thousand books were now\noverdue and that this is the only way\nbooks that were several months\noverdue would be returned.\nZoe Hellinger.
