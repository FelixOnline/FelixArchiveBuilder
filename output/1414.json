Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 07 November 2008 felix\nArts\nAlbus is Pinter Perfect\nCaz Knight finds No Man\u2019s Land at the Albemarle. Harold Pinter strikes again.\nH\narold Pinter\u2019s play No\nMan\u2019s Land is confus-ing. Perhaps it is because the playwright is\nconsidered to be one of\nthe most complex post-WWII dramatists or perhaps because, true to his\n\u2018Pinteresque\u2019 style, the characters are\nthreatened by a force which neither\nthey nor the audience can quite work\nout. Throughout the play there is definitely an air of menace emanating from\nthe only room in which the action takes\nplace. Is it the apparent mental instability and erratic behaviour of the pro-prietor, Hirst, the bizarre situation that\nbrought the stranger, Spooner, into his\nhome after a fortuitous meeting on\nHampstead Heath, or stranger still the\nunfathomable relationship between\nHirst and his helpers/carers/heavies?\nI tried in vain throughout the play to\ncome up with some sort of \u2018plot\u2019 or\npurpose for the play and failed, myself\nlost in that proverbial Land. A 5-star\ncast, starring four real-life stars all of\nwhom lived up to their stellar images,\nwith magnificent performances coming from Michael Gambon as Hirst and\na lesser-known but equally talented\nDavid Bradley as Spooner. Hirst\u2019s mentally unstable character had Gambon\ntaking on a range of egos including an\nobtuse drunk, an outspoken, tally-ho\ntoff and a confused old man heading\nfor senility. Bradley\u2019s drawn, bearded\nface and unrefined garments matched\nperfectly with his high-pitched laughter and incessant ramblings as he took\non the role of \u2018hanger-on\u2019.\nDavid Walliams\u2019 character Foster saw\nhim take on a role contrasting greatly\nto those of the mentally handicapped\nAnne and the vomiting Conservative\nlady in Little Britain. Bordering on aggressive and sinister, both Foster and\nBriggs are fiercely protective of their\nmaster and suspicious of the \u201cnew\nfriend\u201d.PerhapstherolesIhaveforWalliams instilled in my mind made it hard\nfor me to appreciate him in this role.\nThe utter silence that abounds when\nconversation ceases and absence of any\nsound effects or music make No Man\u2019s\nLand all the more gripping and enrap-turing. The stage itself is beautifully\ndressed with a fine collection of spirits\nand liqueurs making up the bar, as well\nas antique chairs and glorious artifacts\nsuch as a large opium pipe, a medieval\nchain-mail helmet and sturdy ancient-looking vases making up the collection\nof items in Hirst\u2019s living room. Given\nthat richness in progression of story,\nvisual spectacle and lighthearted entertainment are the hallmark of theatre worth seeing for most people, No\nMan\u2019s Land is definitely an acquired\nsort of taste that you must develop reasonably soon into the play. For someone who loves the English language as\nmuch as I do, I was in semantic heaven\nlistening to the dialogue which ranged\nthrough utterly comical, philosophical,\nchilling, sexually suggestive, nostalgic and saddening. Pinter\u2019s immense\nskill at creating these conversations\nbetween his characters is outstanding\nand would be just as enjoyable through\nreading the play. However, combined\nwith the sheer strength of acting talent\nthat goes with it, it is pure drama without any of the frills.\nMichael Gambon (left), David Bradley (right) and David Williams star. \u201cFilch, fetch me my wand\u201d. \u201cMichael,\nwrong script\u201d; \u201cShit. Filch fetch me my whisky.\u201d \u201cBetter\u201d.\nM\nen have called me\nmad but the question is not yet settled\nwhether madness\nis or is not the loftiest intelligence \u2013 whether all that is\nprofound \u2013 does not spring from disease of thought, from moods of mind\nexalted at the expenses of the general\nintellect.\u201d American Romantic poet\nof the mysterious and macabre, short\nstory writer and inventor of detective-fiction, Edgar Allan Poe suffered from\nbi-polar disorder along with many other artistic geniuses.\nBi-polar disorder is characterised\nby cycles of mania (lowered inhibi-tions, racing thoughts, loss of control,\nelevated mood, delusion) and depressive episodes (feelings of sadness, guilt,\nanxiety, reduced interest in activities,\npain, suicidal ideation) with episodes\nusually occurring four times per year.\nOther more recent artists (of a kind) to\nsuffer include Axl Rose, Ben Stiller and\nSting. But for now let us consider the\ngeniuses who have a more established\nposition in artistic heritage.\nAccording to psychiatrists, symptoms associated with manic episodes\nsuch as lowered inhibitions, flight of\nideas and heightened creativity and\nproductivity are obvious catalysts in\ncreating potentially great works of\nart. Manic depressives have also been\nknown to talk in rhyme and alliterate\ntheir speech more when they are \u201cup\u201d.\nThe undulating emotions experienced\nby a sufferer will expose them to a\nmuch larger and intense spectrum of\nfeelings and thoughts which could also\ngo a long way to inspire them. As someone who writes poems (very un-cool),\nI find I can never write upon demand\nbut as soon as I experience a flurry of,\nusually negative, emotion I pour forth\nwith ideas, imagery\u2026 but never iambic\npentameter!\nSo who are these mad geniuses, you\nask. Writers include Hemingway, Dickens, Shelley and Woolf. My two all-time favourite poets Keats and Blake\n(who also happened to be a jack of every trade including creating beautiful\noil paintings currently on display at an\nexhibition just outside Birmingham)\nsuffered from the disorder. Beethoven,\nTchaikovsky, van Gogh and Sistine\nchapel decorator Michaelangelo were\nall crazy, too, which often adds to their\nappeal. Admittedly, a lot of the evidence for how madness fuels creativity is based on anecdotal evidence: it is\nvery hard to study the mental illnesses\nof the deceased especially if medical\nrecords do not stretch that far back!\nOr, perhaps the sheer burden of having such a proficient and \u2018thoughtful\u2019\nmind was enough to send them to\ninsanity thus furthering their artistic capabilities?? Certainly, Nietzsche\nmay have sealed the fate of his mental\nhealth by his musings.\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nU\nntil the 25th of January 2009, the Barbican\nproposes a retrospective on the topic of war,\npresenting primarily the\nphotographs of world-renowned Robert Capa and his partner Gerda Taro,\nas well as the perceptive works of contemporary artists which complement\nastonishingly well the first protagonists\u2019 realisations.\nStarting at the higher level of the\nBarbican\u2019s gallery, the main exhibition\nexposes the pieces of Robert Capa, who\nhas been one of the first photographers\nto go behind the lines and shoot war\nactions close-up, therefore becoming\none of the most recognized photojournalists of the 20th century. Coming\nfrom a Hungarian Jewish background,\nCapa fled his home country at twenty\nyears-old to escape the Nazis and established himself in Paris. There he\nmet fellow Jewish expatriate Gerda\nTaro whom had fled Poland for the\nsame reasons. Both passionate about\nphotography, they wanted to voice\ntheir political sentiments through their\nart and started working jointly in 1934.\nOriginally Andre Friedman and Gerta\nPohorylle, they changed their names\nto Robert Capa and Gerda Taro in the\nhope to improve their chances of success by picking two names echoing\nHollywood stars, respectively Frank\nCapra and Greta Garbo. In their begin-nings, Capa and Taro published their\nphotographs together. Their first famous coverage was in 1936, when they\nleft Paris to follow Republican troops\nin Spain and capture the reality of the\nfights against Franco\u2019s fascist rule. Exposed in separate rooms at the Barbican, the difference between Taro and\nCapa\u2019s pieces are often limited to the\nfact that she shot with a Rollei camera\nrendering squared photographs while\nhe shot with a Leica, producing rectangular photos.\nIt is at this period that Capa shot his\nmostfamouswarphotograph:the\u201cFalling Soldier\u201d, in which Capa snapped a\nrunning loyalist soldier at the moment\na bullet hit his forehead. While there\nare some allegations that the moment\nmight have been staged, the picture is,\neven now, still one of the most important war photographs ever taken.\nIn 1937, Taro begun using a Leica\nand emancipated herself from Capa\u2019s\nwork, publishing by herself in many\nimportant publications such as the\nFrench \u201cVu\u201d magazine. Staying alone\nin Spain after Capa returned to France,\nshe left to cover the Battle of Brunete,\nfrom which she did not come back. She\ndied while caught in the Republican\narmy retreat; her body was sent back\nto France to be buried on the day that\nwas to be her 27th anniversary. The\nfirst photojournalist to be killed on the\nfront, she is not only known for being\nthe first female war photographer but\nalso because of her high influence in\nthe European anti-fascist intellectual\ncircles.\nAfter her death, Capa left immediately for Asia to cover the Sino-Japanese\nwar in 1938. He subsequently returned\nto Spain later that year and witnessed\none of the last winning battles of the\nRepublican army. He also reported on\nthe huge refugee movement invading\nBarcelona following Franco\u2019s takeover\nof the country in 1939. It was then five\nyears before Capa went on the front\nagain, this time covering the American\noffensive against Axis forces in Normandy. Here he also took some of his\nbest known photographs, rare depic-This is War! Robert Capa at work\ntions of the scenes of that incredibly\ndifficult mission. He later shot in 1945\nwhat was to be \u201cthe last picture of the\nWorld War II\u201d, as he accompanied the\nAllied in their last battle and witnessed\nfor a second time in his life the death of\na soldier in front of his eyes.\nAlmost all of Capa\u2019s photographs\nconvey a sense of drama and even\nbrutality, as he always tried to shoot\nas close to the action as possible. His\nlack of fear in front of violence doubled\nwith his extraordinary talent for photography has consequently dictated\nthe highest standards of photojournalism up to today.\nOn the lower level of its art gallery,\nthe Barbican proposes another exhibi-tion: \u201cOn the Subject of War\u201d. While\nEmilie Beauchamp goes to the Barbican to worship at the feet of the the God of War Photography\nunrelated to Capa\u2019s work, it thoroughly complements it by exposing a\ncontemporary artistic vision on the\ntopic. It even brings a breath of fresh\nair with less dramatic pieces. Capa\u2019s\npieces were shot almost only in black\nand white and summoned a context of\ncrude realism, which was often over-dramatised by tragic editorialist lines.\nIn contrast, the variety of media used\nin the second exhibition and the colour photographs bring a new vision of\nwar coverage. In one sense, this can be\nparalleled with the evolution of different outlooks on war. Previously there\nwas a purely dualistic aspect in war\nsentiments in the 1930s and 1940s: the\nfascists versus the democrats, the Axis\nversus the Allies, black versus white.\nHowever, today\u2019s wars involve multiple parties wrapped in different shades\nof grey, bringing multifaceted reali-ties. The contemporary use of various\nproduction techniques is essential for\ncapturing the vast array of emotions\nstirred by war; confusion, hatred, hope\nand so on. \u201cOn the Subject of War\u201d explores these emotions by presenting\nfour artists having worked primarily in\nAfghanistan and Iraq, all of whom carry an insightful look on to the actuality\nof these conflicts. A special note has to\nbe made for the extraordinary work of\nOmer Fast and his piece \u201cThe Casting\u201d,\na two-screen, double-sided projection\nof a soldier\u2019s account of two different\nviolent events. The artist has cut and\nmixed the accounts of both stories to\nthe point which they become increasingly undistinguishable from one another in order to present how war\nstories can be changed and mediated\nthrough medias.\nIn short, the Barbican succeeded in\nbalancing the most classical and original pieces of war coverage ever done\nwith new and definitely modern pieces.\nWhilst the combination of both exhibitions can be a little long, one is not as\ngood without the other as overall they\nprovide an excellent perspective of how\nwar has been perceived and defined by\nmedia coverages since the 1930s.\nRobert Capa is on until 25th Jan\nI highly recommend going to see Robert Capa\u2019s work. His images are unlike anything you have ever seen and they tug at all your heartstrings.\n\n"

Since 2001, the\npercentage of international students at\nImperial had risen by 26% to 46% last\nyear. It was felt that these students effectively have no proper representation\nin any committee within the Union,\nalthough some members of council argued this. Certain members of Council felt that the Overseas Committee\n[OSC] gave adequate representation\nfor these students, however it was then\npointed out that they only cater for the\nstudents who are part of the respective societies. It was also pointed out\nthat the OSC doesn\u2019t necessarily look\nafter the welfare of the students, with\nSocial Clubs Committee [SCC] Chair\nPeter Mabott pointing out that this\nshould surely be the role of the Deputy\nPresident (Education & Welfare). Miss\nTheodorou replied by simply saying \u201cI\ncan\u2019t be in 10 places at once\u201d.\nIn the paper selected to Council, it\nstated that the International Officer\nshall be responsible for those issues\nwhich specifically relate to international students and organise relevant\neducational and training events and\nbriefings, and report accordingly. They\nwould also sit on appropriate Union\nCommittees, as well as represent the\nUnion\u2019s views on the relevant College\nCommittees. Other points included\njobs such as to facilitate an International Student\u2019s Forum and support\nInternational Students\u2019 involvement in\nall relevant areas of Union and College\nactivity.\nThe officer would also be responsible\nto the Deputy President (Education &\nWelfare) for the research and implementation of campaigns relating to\nInternational Students, as well as carry\nout such duties as may, from time to\ntime, be laid down by the Council or\nthe Executive Committee.\nSome interesting points were also\nraised as to the election of the position.\nSince the officer would be representing\nsuch a large proportion of the student\nbody, they would have to be elected by\na campus-wide ballot, however only\noverseas students could vote. This\nwould mean that all the European Union students could not vote, yet what\nwas considered even more obscure\nwas the fact the person running for the\nposition wouldn\u2019t have to be an international student themselves.\nThis was felt a bit strange since for all\nthe other faculty union positions, the\nmembers running for the position had\nto be from that relevant faculty, so as to\ngive the best representation. However,\nit was felt by the Representation and\nWelfare board that as long as the candidate had the best interests at heart\ntheir representatives, then it wouldn\u2019t\nreally matter. Others felt that this was\npurely creating another seat for Hacks\nor CV chasers on Council.\nHopefully the international student\nbody will be able to select the person\nthat best represents them and not another person simply aiming to enhance\ntheir CV.\nNew International Officer\nposition to be created\nHannah Theodorou explaining the role at Council\nPregnant girlfriend\npoisoned by Mary\u2019s\nconsultant\nDina Ismali\nNews Correspondent\nSt Mary\u2019s hospital has been hit by scandal yet again, as it was revealed that\none of its consultants has been charged\nwith attempting to poison a pregnant\nwoman in a bid to cause her to miscarry his child. The 43 year old consultant\ninvolved worked at the hospital\u2019s chest\nand allergy department and is believed\nto have been having an extramarital affair with his victim.\nPolice say he put a potent concoction of the drugs Methotrexate and Diclofenac into her tea while at her home\non 2 February to induce an abortion.\nFive days later he is alleged to have carried out a second poisoning attempt\nat his workplace. The doctor was arrested a week later and charged at\nCamberwell Green Magistrates\u2019 Court\nlast month. A spokesman for Imperial\nCollege Healthcare NHS Trust said the\nconsultant was excluded from working\nat the trust in February 2008 when a\ncriminal investigation into allegations\nmade against him began. His case\nhas been transferred to Inner London Crown Court for a plea hearing\nin December, he faces three charges\nof \u2018attempting to unlawfully administer a poison or other noxious thing\u2019.\nAlthough he has been granted bail, he\nhas had to provide a sum of \u00a310,000 to\nsupport it, and surrender his passport.\nHis ex-lover, in the meantime, gave\nbirth to a healthy son one month ago.\nThecase,however,isnottheonlyembarrassment the Trust has had to deal\nwith in recent weeks. It follows revelations that a team of St. Mary\u2019s surgeons\nmistakenly removed the wrong organ\nfrom a woman who was booked in for\na gynaecological operation. Know one\nhas yet been disciplined or suspended\nfor the blunder.\nTo further add to St. Mary\u2019s woes\nthis week its newly opened \u00a31.4 million\nbirthing unit is under investigation after the deaths of two babies in under\nthree months.\nAre you a user of Imperial College\u2019s\nHealth Centre?\nIf so, Hannah Theodorou, the Deputy President\n(Education and Welafre) would like to know your\nviews. Next week representatives from the Health\nCentre and Patient User Groups will be meeting at\nthe termly Patient Participation Group meeting to\ndiscuss patients\u2019 views of the service and discuss\nwhat possible improvements could be made. Email\nher on dpew@imperial.ac.uk- your comments will\nbe kept completely anonymous.\n\n"

The late running of\nthe opposition raised a few half jokes\nabout a walkover but it wasn\u2019t to be.\nThe game started with a good spell\nof pressure from the RSM and some\ngood defending containing Goldsmiths attempts to break. The RSM\nmidfield dominated possession and\nchances were created and it was left\nwinger Matt Bell who rounded his\nman and got a great cross to the back\npost where first year James Tolley\nwas on hand to nod home from close\nrange. The second was quick to follow\nwhen the Goldsmiths goalkeeper, who\nwas struggling against the wind, failed\nto clear from the edge of his box and\nsome quick thinking from Ben Bell on\nthe right saw the ball lob the keepers.\nRSM were now controlling the play\nwith the back line making life difficult\nfor the goldsmiths forwards.\nBut RSM weren\u2019t finished yet and another good passage of play combining\nthe central and left midfielders ended\nin a good near post finish to give Tolley\nhis second. At 3-0 there was a nervous\nconfidence starting to settle in with the\ncaptain keeping the lines, and this was\nfurther pressed 10 minutes from half\ntime when RSM old boy Nic English\nwas on hand to scream home a great\nstrike from outside the box.\nThe half time team talk was a warning of the wind and as expected Goldsmiths started the second half brightly.\nRSM then delivered the killer blow on\nthe break when on-loan midfielder Jon\nM finished well after Goldsmiths failed\nto clear their lines. With time ticking\ndown, a dejected Goldsmiths became\nmore and more frustrated at their inability to break down the RSM defence,\nand on the rare occasion when they\nSaturday 1st

going in.\nThe late subs of the Puente De La Vega\nbrothers gave the team an injection of\nenergy for the last 15 minutes. As time\nran down the pressure was on but except a last ditch tackle from Jon, RSM\nnever looked like slipping up.\nThe final whistle went to the sound\nof cheers from the RSM players who\nfind themselves having taken 4 points\nfrom 6 games against the top 6 in the\nleague. With the teams around us still\nto play and being only 3 points off\nfourth place this team has plenty of\ntime to turn the previous form into a\ngood run and move up the table.\nIC 2nd XI advance in Cup\nDamian Phelan\nFootball\nBUCS Cup\nIC Men\u2019s 2nd XI\t 3\nRoehampton 2nd XI\t 1\n(A.E.T)\nThe 2nd XI travelled to Roehampton\nlast Wednesday to tackle their 2nd\nteam in an epic encounter in the first\nround of the BUCS cup. Roehampton,\ndescribed as the \u2018pits\u2019, was always going to be a tough place to come away\nfrom with a win but after a period of\nextra time that threatened to be halted by darkness, the 2nd\u2019s managed to\nprogress with a thrilling 3-1win.\nWe began the first half with a display\nof champagne football. After an early\nscare, in which a Roehampton winger\ncut in from the left and flashed a shot\nacross goal which scraped the crossbar of keeper Dicko\u2019s goal, we began\nto dominate affairs. The energetic\ncentral midfield pairing of Richie and\nGregor stamped their authority on the\ngame and patrolled the centre of the\npitch releasing the threatening wingers Jon Hill and Tom Neisser while Jon\nCard at right back also roamed up the\ntouchline threatening the opposition\u2019s\ndefence. Fittingly it was a Card throw-in which led to the opening goal as he\nlaunched a Rory Delap-like missile into\nthe box which was headed out by Zeus,\nthe Roehampton centre back, only\nfor Richie to latch onto the dropping\nball, scoring with the sweetest of vol-leys. This was precisely the catalyst IC\nneeded to push on. The forward pairing of Damian and Sim began to ter-rorise the Roehampton defence. Sim,\nwith his lightning pace, and Damian\nwith some intelligent running and neat\ninterplay with both Richie and Gregor\nmanaged to create several unconverted\nopportunities. As the referee blew the\nwhistle for half-time IC were leading\n1-0 but were well aware that they could\nwell rue those wasted opportunities.\nAt the beginning of the second half\nwe seemed to be distracted with the\nknowledge of those missed chances.\nRoehampton seized the upper hand\nin the game and momentum shifted in\ntheir favour. Their direct style was difficult to cope with but the IC back four\nremained strong with Scott Mackenzie, Daniel Southcott, Card and Fern\nall proving strong in the tackle and in\nthe air. IC always looked threatening\non the counter attack but Roehampton\ncontinued to play a high pressure game\npumping the ball to their large centre\nforward and playing long diagonal balls\nwhich were tricky to cope with. The\nbruising nature of the game took its\ntoll when Mitch was badly injured go-The Miners battle hard against Goldsmiths to earn a deserved victory\ning over on his ankle. The defence was\nre-jigged with Jon Hill taking over at\ncentre back but the ensuing confusion\nled to an equaliser when a long through\nball found a Roehampton midfielder\nin what looked to be an offside position but he played on and coolly slotted the ball into to the back of the net.\nAt 1-1 with 15 minutes left both sides\nknew that another goal would almost\ncertainly guarantee progression to the\nnext round. The two IC substitutes on\nthe wings, Viktor and Romain, began\nto use their fresh legs to good effect\nstretching the Roehampton full backs,\nViktor even calling the goalkeeper into\nactionwithastingingeffortfromatight\nangle. However it was home side who\nposed the greatest threat putting Dicko\nunder severe pressure, which was handled effectively. His efforts in the final\n10 minutes of normal time kept the\ngame square with several point blank\nsaves and some courageous handling\nfrom the plethora of crosses and set\npieces that were thrown at him. A slice\nof luck was also required to keep IC in\nthe tie as a Roehampton effort right at\nthe death cannoned of the crossbar.\nA sense of relief accompanied the\nwhistle for the end of 90 minutes. The\nreferee announced a 14 minute period of extra time much to the astonishment of both sets of players but it\nwas Imperial who started extra time\nwith the greater sense of urgency and\nimmediately set about putting the opposition under the cosh. The pressure\nsoon turned to a goal as Viktor made\nan incisive break down the right and\nfed a ball into Damian whose shot\nping-ponged about and finally fell to\nSim who tucked it away from no more\nthan 6 yards out. The onslaught from\nRoehampton was inevitable but once\nagain they found Dicko in unbeatable\nform. He made save after save and\nshocked the Roehampton crowd with\nhis tigon-like reflexes. The home side\nwere deflated, a fact which showed itself as Gregor stole the ball from a Roehampton full back and proceeded to\nslam it home past the goalkeeper. The\nfinal whistle sounded not long after as\nthe Imperial 2nd XI returned back to\nthe bus and S.Ken with a place in the\nsecond round secured.\nMustapher Botchway\nFootball\nBUCS Cup\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XI\t 7\nUni at Medway 1st XI\t 1\nThe day pecan with the 1st XI (h)\nerring on the side of caution on their\nhen-counter with the Universities at\nMedway. Said university are a gnu side\nand thus had bee-n made to start from\nleague 7A, where the 3rd XI reside.\nGirrafe-ter Medway beat them with a\nresounding 11-1 victory, coupled with\nthe rumours that various members of\ntheir squad had been recently released\nfrom clubs as big as QPR and Charlton,\nit would have been foal-ish if we mon-key-ed around with this fixture.\nJokes aside, Captain Donovan delivered an empha-tick team talk that implored us to take control (Troll isn\u2019t an\nanimal) of the game whale-st still giving\nMedway the respect they deserved.\nAfter a shaky ini-seal 2 minutes\nwhere lackadaisical attempts to clear\nthe ball forced a smart save from Mustapher Botchway, the 1st XI woke up.\nThe defenders made a mare of the long\nthrow by Michael Donovan (or Maradono or Donaldinho as he likes to be\ncalled), which raced onto Leslie Eshun\nwho squared it to Irv Howson to stick\nit in the back of the newt.\nWe relaxed at this point, knowing\nthat goals could come aplenty. Medway\nshowed their class, especially in the\nmiddle of the pitch where the central\nmidfielder and the two wingers combined well with some nifty back h-eels\nand testing balls. Peter New, a fresher\nto the club and university dealt with\nthese threats with ease and compo-sure, much akin to the manner he has\nfulfilled the role of centre half, previously held by last year\u2019s 1st XI captain.\nWill Swain won a corner and delivered a peach of a ball where Eshun rose\nlike a salmon and headed it in to make\nit 2-0 with 20 minutes bear-ly played.\nAfter an-otter good spell of posses-sion, Samuel Rickards released a (f)\ninch per-ferret through ball for Dion\nBenincasa to latch on and coolly finish\nto make it 3 goals to IC and jackal to\nMedway at the halftime whistle.\nDuring the break, 1st XI stalwart Ed\nMartins reite-rat-ed that Medway were\nnot a bad side and that though we were\nplaying excellently, they were definitely\ngoing to come back into the game. He\nfurther advised that we may have to\nswallow our pride and play cautiously\nfor the first 5-10 minutes.\n2 minutes into the second half, Swan\nturned provider again, knocking the\nball past the Medway defender, for Eshun to slip in and slot it past the goal-keeper, to make it 4 goals in 5 games\nfor the cheetah like club fresher.\nWhat punished Medway was their\nwingers, though very comfortable with\nthe ball, were playing too deep in our\nhalf and when we broke on the counter attack, we could utilise both the full\nbacks and wingers to produce goals.\nThis happened in unorthodox fashion when on one of the breaks, Samule\nwas felled. Martins produced a cross\nfield ball from the free kick which\nlanded on a plate to the unmarked Donovan-Nistelrooy to head in.\nHopes of a clean sheet were dashed\nafter a speculative shot from the Medway midfielder was intercepted by McMullen who then scored an own goal.\nMcMullen responded in true fashion 5 minutes later by running half the\npitch, past 4 Medway players. Botchway\u2019s shouts of \u2018GOPHER IT\u2019 we responded well, where the man-drill-ed\nit to the bottom right corner.\n\u2018Lanky\u2019 Swain rounded off a perfect\nday at Harlington with a clinical header after a cross from de Figueiredo.\nBrownie points to those who can\nnumber the animals in the article.

An amazing idea that originated from the Golden Era of ICHC\nwhen Mary Williamson (Spanner)\nruled the nest of hockey legends. Freshers Tour was born has been an integral\npart of the ICHC experience since.\nMaria Parkes (Dominator) was in\ncharge and had recruited well with\nequal amounts of freshers and oldies\nattending the weekend. Allowing time\nfor masks and drinking on the Friday\nnight at the Ball, the club left at 10am\nfrom the union. With banter galore\nfrom the night before and awesome\ntunes from MC Date.R. the journey\ndown to Brighton was more entertaining than the time Jon Lander (Toad-Fish) projectile vomited into a bin outside Belushi\u2019s - it was then he lost his\n100% record at the Christmas Dinner!\nOn arrival at the sea the team enjoyed fish and chips as well as the joys\nof loosing \u00a35 in five minutes at the slot\nmachines. No matter, we played hockey and met with El Presidente, Mark\nRoberton (Tranny to some). Son Lucas blessed us with his Jedi powers before we hit the town for food and drink\n- very civilised. The night was danced\naway in a club that had the class of a\nfirst date in the Prince Regent followed\nby a snog and a snuggle. Nice!\nSleep was very much needed for the\nall important game on our way home.\nIn ICHC tradition we won scoring almost as many times as Dr. Harold had\nlast week.

Part organic food shop, part caf\u00e9, My Village is unique in the care and\nenthusiasm of its two Kurdish owners who do their utmost to ensure customer satisfaction and quality of\nproduct. The wooden French farmhouse-cum-Moroccan tea room interior really is a labour of love and\none of the most pleasant places to just be in London if you just want to escape from the madness, sip a\ndrink and read a book. One really feels protected and nestled away from the grey expanse of London.\nThey serve the pre-prepared food from the shop to you on plates at the tables and have recently begun\nmaking their own wholesome soups. I can never resist ordering one of the exotic guava-containing smoothies they make from scratch with my cake. All the cakes are tasty but the lemon cheesecake reigns over all.\nIf you can find room also order a hot chocolate because they are the best I have tasted in my life and I tend\nto be very picky about hot chocolate; it is never quite meets my standards in most cafes and restaurants no\nmatter how high brow or expensive. (An exception to this rule is Carluccio\u2019s wonderful Chococcino.)\nPulkra\nTube: Fulham Broadway\nThis pretty little bungalow is perched on the edge of Eel Brook Common, bordering\nNew King\u2019s Road - a short walk from Fulham Broadway station. The park its self is very\npeaceful and never too crowded on account of its anonymity, and at the moment the boulevard of plane trees which traverse the border have sprinkled the park with their autumn\ncolours. Pulkra is Italian run, explaining the quality and seriousness with which the food\nis prepared.\nAll of it is made on the premises, which is reassuring and is something rare nowadays\nin cafes. Their home-made ice cream and sorbets are just amazing, and if you are extra\nhungry you can order some savory food prior (or, indeed, after) your sweet. Sandwiches\nand hot food are available and they are accommodating; you can pretty much tell them\nwhat you would like to eat regardless of what the menu says. Once again, I always seem\nto go straight for the Valhrona wheat-free chocolate cake. Again, please don\u2019t let the fact\nthat it does not include conventional flour put you off - it gives the cake a more earthy\ntaste, complementing the chocolate, and avoids dryness. Cookies, muffins and pastries are\nalso attractively laid out on display. Pulkra is popular on weekend mornings as they serve\ncooked breakfasts.\nPeyton and Byrne\nTube: Euston\nIf you feel like some mental (and physical exercise) to counteract any gluttony about to be undertaken then mission north to the\nWellcome centre, Euston. There is always a great exhibition here (Sir Henry Wellcome\u2019s personal collection of random artifacts and\nworks of art on the first floor is a wonderful permanent installation). But best of all is the airy and spacious Peyton and Byrne caf\u00e9\nsituated in between the exhibition space and the Waterstone\u2019s bookshop. It serves gormet style snacks which are pricey (but hey, this\nis food, it goes inside your body and so you are perfectly at rights to overspend) such as salads, quiches and sandwiches as well as some\nhot meals. I always spend about 10 minutes minimum choosing my dessert.\nHere they serve cakes, sweet tarts, muffins, cupcakes, I inevitably always go for the largest slice which also happens to be the gluten\nfree chocolate cake. Don\u2019t let \u201cgluten-free\u201d instill you with fear and the image of dusty health food stores. Its lack of wheat flower gives\nit a gloriously rich texture. Even I was full after this. Awesome choco-sugar high. Now burn it off by running back to Imperial.\nThere is a branch in St Pancras for anyone traveling to the midlands or to belle Paris.\nYum Chaa\nTube: Camden Town\nI am loath to give away my (now not so) best-kept secret in Camden Town.\nYou may not even find this dinky tea room for it is hidden in the corner on the\nwooden-decking upper level of the shopping area next to the Loch. For someone\nin love with tea as opposed to jitter-inducing coffee, there is something exciting\nabout taking your time sniffing the cups filled with their 20 odd teas, although\nthis only hinders the decision making process. I have tried mixing two (Lapsang\nSouchon and Chilli Chilli Bang Bang) to good results. It is also possible to buy\ntheir teas to take home.\nThere is a modest bohemian feel to the place but without any of the inevitable \u201cethos\u201d, hippies or health/free-from foods which are a staple feature a lot of\nboho Camden haunts. Their brownies are definitely NOT for sharing and have\nno qualms about being very firm with anyone who asks for a taste. This is just too\ngood to share, in this instant sharing is anything but caring. (Blueberry) muffins\nhere melt in the mouth, to pardon a terribly trite saying, but it is actually what\nthey do. Sitting outside one gets to soak up the atmosphere wafting up from the\nfood stalls in the square, safe in your elevated haven.\nThe Hummingbird Bakery\nTube: South Ken\nThis is an American export which explains the sugar sweet pink and brown d\u00e9cor (even in the loos). This\nis a little girl\u2019s confectionary dream come true. Think Hansel and Gretel stumbling upon the gingerbread\nhouse minus evil child-eating witch. Cupcakes are their specialty here and the reason why hoards of Kensington and Chelsea folk flock here - cupcakes are so in now, don\u2019cha know. I personally abhor faddish trends\nin food and devour these babies for their taste alone and their glittering, colourful beauty.\nThe cakes\u2019 texture is as moist and delicate as you could ever dream and the generous dollop of cream\ncheese frosting makes you wish they sold it by the tub. They come in mainly vanilla or chocolate and there\nis a cupcake of the day. Another thing to try here, a personal favourite, is their Red Velvet Cake. Expect a\nbrick sized portion which is exactly how I like to eat my cake. This cake hails from the deep south and is\nusually enjoyed on public holidays like Independence Day. It is worth every gram of fat and calorie in there\nand tastes so heavenly all guilt will vanish instantly.\nIt gets busy on weekends but there is seating both inside and out. If you are really lazy they will actually\ndeliver to your door (price subject to area), minimum expenditure being around 20 pounds.\nKonditor and Cook\nTube: Piccadilly\nThey claim to be the best cakes in London and seeing as I love\ncake more than any other person in London, I think I am in an\nideal position to say that these delights come pretty close. My only\nquibble is the apparent decrease in slice size which always riles me.\nIndulge properly, dears. This branch of K&C is part of the independent Soho Curzon cinema which has a very cultured and arty,\nyet chilled out ( and by no means pretentious) atmosphere.\nSeeing as it borders on one of my favourite areas of London\n(Soho) there is nothing better for dark afternoons than preceding\ncake with even more retail indulgence. Alcohol can be enjoyed in\nconjunction with your cake. K&C outdo themselves like the Hummingbird with ample lashings of cream cheese icings. Lemon Chiffon is sublime but better still is the Curly Whirly: chocolate with\nvanilla bean icing. Other branches pop up east in Canary Wharf\nand Grey\u2019s Inn road. Business is undoubtedly booming with com-fort-eating Suits.\n\n"

Write to us.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n333\nFriday 07 November 2008 felix\nL\nast Thursday, Imperial College Hindu Society welcomed over 300 people to\ntheir annual Ujaali celebration in the Great Hall, the\nnight focused around the traditional,\nRaas Garba style of dancing, hailing\nfrom Gujarat in northern India, and\nheld in celebration of Diwali- the festival of light. The Hindu Society committee kindly invited felix to attend\nand report on the evening:\nNot knowing what to expect, I tottered over to the Sherfield building,\ncamera and note book at the ready. I\nfound the staircase and foyer outside\nof the Great Hall decked in colourful\nswathes of fabric, with strings of flowers guiding you up the stairs. Even bet-ter, there was food on sale along side\nsome painted sticks- dandiya (which\nI originally took to be candles) that\nwere in anticipation of one of the main\nevents of the evening- the Dandiya\nRaas.\nIn preparation for Ujaali, members\nof the committee spent days making\ntrips to Ikea, and hunting out sari ma-terial, in order to dress the Great Hall,\nthe foyer and the staircase.\nThe Great Hall itself was dressed\nwith colourful patterned fabrics on\nLondon to Brighton Run\nthe walls and focused around a murti\n(statue), of the gods Radha and Krishna, in the centre. The murti is centre of\nattention and is there to invite the gods\nRadha and Krishna into the event.\nThe evening was introduced by co-presidents Paren Chohen and Anand\nPandit, with music from the Chiswickbased band Strings.\nParen talked to me about what to expect from the evening. This evening is\nHindu Society\u2019s annual Ujaali celebra-tion, for Diwali, or the festival of light\n(which was on Tuesday). Tonight\u2019s\ncelebration is a folk dance, which is\ntraditional to the Gujarati region of\nnorthern India, and a performance of\ndance.\nThe event not only attracts Hindus,\nbut also Sikhs, Muslims and people of\ndifferent faiths who come along to support and to be entertained. The event is\nshowcase for Hindu Society and what\nit is about, a chance for non-members\nand friends of members to come and\nget involved and have a nice evening.\nThe evening began with a prayer, at\nthe end of which we were all invited to\njoin in the first dancing of the evening.\nI joined several others (mainly boys)\nin the shuffle sheepishly to the side of\nthe room and hoped that no one would\nnotice.\nInitially, the dancing was quite tentative (and mainly girls), but upon\nreturning from a quick refreshment\nbreak, I found the Great Hall alive with\npeople, dancing in circles around the\ncentral statue. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were now as\nmany boys as girls dancing and, though\na lot of people were stood at the side,\nthis was mainly so they could catch\ntheir breath before re-joining!\nThe informal dancing stopped briefly\nfor those gathered to enjoy a rehearsed\nperformance of Garba dancing, based\non a traditional routine. Gaya Rajasooriar explained to me that the traditional\ndancing and the form of the event was\nbased on the northern Indian, Gujurati\nstyle of celebrating Navaratri, so for\nmany, even Indian, members of Hindu\nSociety, the style of dancing was new\nto them. With this in mind, everyone\nwas invited to be taught some simple\nRaas Garba steps in small groups, each\nlead by one of the performers, so no\none had an excuse for not joining in.\nA particularly special dance during\nthe evening is performed using dan-diya (painted sticks around a foot and\na half long), lining up in rows, dancers\nhit sticks against their opposite partner\u2019s. Though the dance is supposed\nto represent a mock fight, it also has a\nsocial element, as dancers meet lots of\nnew people as the dance is performed.\nTalking to people at the event, many\nhad turned up due to the reputation of\nthe event being lively and social; while\nothers were attracted by the cultural\nside of the event. Nick, marketing officer for Hindu society, told felix \u201cFor\nUjaali, everyone comes because it\u2019s a\nbig social event, it\u2019s really nice to see\neveryone and have fun. Although there\nis spiritual significance to the evening,\nit\u2019s mainly a cultural event so everyone\ncan come along, experience it and have\nfun.\u201d And according to Temoor Naeem,\nthe reason the event attracts such a\nhigh turn-out is that \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice\nevent, with lots of people, and it\u2019s easy\nto get involved. The evening is cultural\neducation for everyone, not just Hindus and Indians.\u201d\nAside from being in awe of the beautiful dresses, and how nicely they move\nwhile you dance, I was pleasantly surprised to find a large event where you\ncan have a friendly atmosphere, and\nwhere people are happy to talk and be\nengaging. I was particularly interested\nto visit a society based around a reli-gion, finding out what it is they actually do. It would be easy to assume that\na religious society is just about prayer\nor discussing their faith, where in reality religion is only part of Hindu society\u2019s activities. A lot of what the society provides is cultural or social, and a\nway to meet people who are often of\na similar background. Ujaali is an excellent example of an event that can\nreach out to people of different faiths\nand backgrounds, introducing friends\nof members to the culture surrounding\nHinduism whilst having fun.\nUjaali is Hindu Society\u2019s biggest\nevent of the year, however the society\naims to promote Hinduism via a mixture of social, cultural and religious\nevents including:\nSpiritual and philosophical talks,\nsuch as, \u2018Get Connected\u2019 (10th 12th\nNovember) which is a series of lectures\non inspired living discussing goals, aspirations and why we are here at Imperial, from a speaker prominent in the\nmission.\nLater this term Hindu Society will be\ndoing charity work, going into central\nLondon with food for homeless people.\nAs well, SEWA week next term- a week\nof charity events for CAREducation,\nwho build schools in India and Africa\n(www.careducation.org).\nDiwali, or Deepavali, is the festival of lights. It is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddists alike. People light divas (candles) on the Hindu month of Karthika, which falls in October/November. In Hindusim,\nDiwali primarily marks the homecoming of Lord Rama after his 14 year banishment. However, the killing\nof the Narakasura and the attainment of nirvana by Lord Mahavira are just some of the other reasons for\nrejoicing.\nDiwali is spread over the course of five days, during which many rituals are observed. For Hindus, it all\nbegins with the cleaning of the home, putting up decorations and divas. The divas were originally used to\nguide Lord Rama back to the kingdom of Ayodhya as it was a dark moonless night. It is also believed to\nhelp the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, find her way into peoples\u2019 homes to bring peace and prosperity.\nLike any other major festival, families come together to exchange gifts and sweets. Usually, in the UK\nrelatives dine together and then light fireworks. On the fourth day, businessmen perform Chopra Pujan.\nThis is to signify the closing of the old accounts and the opening of the new ones, in hope of a successful\nyear to come.\nAt Imperial College, the Hindu Society hold their annual \u2018Ujaali\u2019 Garba to mark the event. Both Hindus\nand non-Hindus gather to dance and pray with their brothers and sisters. This major event in the HinduSoc\ncalendar spreads the joy and knowledge of Diwali to everyone.\nA modern take on Diwali: Regardless of the mythological explanation one prefers, what the festival of\nlights really stands for today is a reaffirmation of hope, a renewed commitment to friendship and goodwill,\nand a religiously sanctioned celebration of the simple, and some not so simple, joys of life - Times of India\neditorial.\nUjaali: An evening of Raas Garba\nOpposite page: Dancers perform a traditional Garba routine, focused around the murdi.

Thankfully,\nI tend be able to break the ice if her\ngadget-loving husband is around, and\nthe wife would naturally confess her\nmisunderstanding; if he\u2019s not around,\nit could be my lucky day.\nThis time round a Stuff bikini girl\ncaught my attention, as she was much\nlarger than what I\u2019m used to. The \u201cStuff\nLive\u201d poster in the underground tunnel towards South Kensington Station\ngave me an excuse to visit the ExCel\nCentre for the second time within the\nsame month, the last time being at the\n\u201cFuture Of Web Apps Expo\u201d combined\nwith \u201cDiggnation Live\u201d \u2013 frankly only\nthe latter made it worth going.\nFor \u00a320 per head \u201cStuff Live\u201d must\nbe a damn good show, but then again I\nmust remember that the credit crunch\nis not just some cereal. Luckily Stuff\nwas giving away free passes on Twitter,\nand I just happened to be one of the\nlucky winners. If you didn\u2019t go, don\u2019t\nworry: I\u2019ve compiled a list of the show\u2019s\nbest bits for you.\nI\u2019ve also got some videos on http://\nis.gd/6goK and have a look at my photos on http://is.gd/6fI8 . Hopefully next\nyear I\u2019ll get to go to Stuff Live for free\nagain (or be given a press pass!).\nPS: Twitter users can follow me at twit-ter.com/richardlai Roland V-Drums TD-9KX\nA small crowd gathered around Roland\u2019s booth, so I wriggled my way\nto the front to see what the musical\ninstrument manufacturer was doing there. It turned out they were\ndoing a demo on their electronic\ndrum kit, TD-9KX, which seemed\nto be capable of pretty much any\nstyle you can think of, ranging from\nclassic rock to jazz to even bubble\nsounds, plus you can tweak every\nsound effect if you\u2019re really bored,\nbut you would expect to get that\nfor the eye-bleeding \u00a31200 price\ntag. Still it made good entertainment and pretty much everyone\nwas dancing, but sadly my camera\nhad just run out of battery - I miss\nmy Nikon DSLR.\nFace 3D-Mapping by University of Hertfordshire\nI was very surprised to see a university exhibiting at the gadget show: for\nsome reason University of Hertfordshire\u2019s electronic engineering department decided that it was the right place to show off their mini humanoid robot and 3D face-mapping technology. I had a go on the latter and it\nwasn\u2019t very convincing \u2013 I\u2019m sure our own EE department could have - or\nalready have - done a much better job! Good luck to them anyway.\nBespoke Arcades\nPac-Man, Street Fighter, Street\nRacer\u2026 you name it, and the folks\nover Bespoke Arcades will deliver\ntheir hand-built arcade machines\nto you packing over 220 titles. The\nmachines at Stuff Live were of great\nbuild quality and enjoyed by many\ngamers, but at \u00a32850 I\u2019m afraid\nmost will have to, ironically, revert\nto their high-def gaming consoles\nat home.\nSony POP entertainment vending machine\nThis machine was just released last week: it is the world\u2019s first multimedia vending machine\nand will be available at airports, cinemas and maybe even train stations. Not only does it pop\nout PS3 games, Blu-ray discs and DVDs in their original cases (as the latter did for me when\nI used a \u201c2 for \u00a310\u201d deal at the show), but you can also download movies and MP3 tracks\nstraight onto any flash media and even iPods. Since the machine is networked, fresh tracks\nare regularly pumped straight into the black-and-yellow machines. No need to panic for pre-travel iPod-updates from now on!\nDigiskin - gadget-skinning service\nNow this is something special: rather than\ngiving your loved one an ordinary gadget this\nChristmas, why not customise it with your favourite pattern or even photo? Digiskin will be\nopening a store on Regent Street and offering\na skinning service for \u00a325 for a mouse, \u00a335 on\nsmaller gadgets such as mobile phones, and\nstarting form \u00a355 for laptops and larger de-vices. Their representative said their service is\nhighly flexible and they will talk to every customer to make sure they get the right design.\nThe vacuum forming process only takes about\nhalf an hour as well.\nJabra BT3030 Bluetooth remote and\nhandsfree\nI was attracted to the Jabra BT3030 not\nonly because of its stylish design, but also\nby the pretty girl who was wearing it as a\npendant. Anyway, the shiny Bluetooth device acts as both a transceiver and a remote\ncontrol, allowing you to control stereo music playback (that\u2019s \u201cA2DP\u201d for you) and receive phone calls. It also has a built-in clip\nif you\u2019re not girly enough to wear it on a\nnecklace. Costing just \u00a335. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\ntoo much to ask for this Christmas.\nKota the Triceratops\nYou may be cruel enough to tear Elmo into bits, but surely no one can resist\nthe cuteness of Kota the Triceratops? The reborn dinosaur has 11 sensors\nto interact with the young-hearted. It even responds to neck-scratches like\na cat! A large cat perhaps as the company claims that it is large enough for\na child to sit on, but you won\u2019t have to worry too much as apparently Kota\nis \u201ctoo lazy to walk around the room\u201d.\nAsus Eee Top desktop, Eee PC S101 and U6 Bamboo laptops\nIt was nice to see one of my favourite computer brands having a dedicated booth at the show, and what made it even\nbetter was that Asus brought along three brand new products. The \u00a3449 Eee Top is the company\u2019s first all-in-one\ndesktop with a touchscreen, featuring a 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor and 160GB hard disk space, supporting both\nstylus (which lives inside the keyboard) and finger input. Despite failing to figure out how to perform right-click without a mouse, I really enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to those looking for a home media centre. Also,\ngiven such user-friendly interface, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the Eee Top flooding the nation\u2019s kindergartens.\nSticking with the Eee brand, Asus has introduced the S101 as the line\u2019s premium model. This sexy design makes all\nprevious models look like plastic toys, but all that glitter on the case (available in brown or graphite), brushed-steel\nfinish around the keyboard, 10.2\u201d LCD, 5.4 hours of battery and 16GB of solid state drive will cost you \u00a3449 (same as\nthe Eee Top). It\u2019s probably something to dream about during this time of financial crisis.\nLastly, the environmentally-friendly, ultraportable U6 Bamboo laptop, which is built with highly recyclable compo-nents, and due to the nature of wooden pattern every machine is unique. Available from selected retailers for \u00a31300.\nLCDs from LG, NEC, Epson\u2019s\nHD projector and Q-London 3D\nVideo Eyewear\nRight in front of the hall entrance\nwas the giant LG/ask booth, which\nfeatured the LG 6100 42\u201d LCD TV,\nretailing at \u00a3749 for its impressive\nslimness and the 100Hz flicker-free\nresponse. Sticking with the display\ntechnology, NEC also showcased\nan astonishing LCD6520L 65\u201d LCD\nscreen inside their \u201cvan\u201d booth,\nalong with their professional range\nwhich attracted many young gam-ers. Epson was also there to display\ntheir full HD EH-TW3000 projector\nwhich simply blew my mind.\nOn a much smaller scale we have\nthe Q-London 3D Video Eyewear,\nwhich gives you total privacy even\nthough you would also look like a\ndork when using it. Unfortunately,\nfor the short-sighted like myself you\nwill need to wear it over your glasses\nor wear contact lenses, as there is no\nadjustable focus like you get in cam-corders. The QL240 claims to have\nsimulate a 50\u201d screen as seen from\n2M, with the QL920v doing an 80\u201d\nscreen from 1.5M, priced at \u00a385.10\nand \u00a3153.18 respectively.\nAudio: Chord Chordette Gem, Q Acoustics Q-AV System,\nSonos iPhone OS app\nOn the audio front there were three interesting products: firstly I found\nthe colourful range of Chord\u2019s Chordette Gem Bluetooth (A2DP, again)\nmusic receiver. It claims to stream very high sound quality from your\nsupported mobile phones to your hi-fi system using its 24-bit digital-to-analogue (DAC) converter, and is aimed at the younger MP3 audience with a price tag of \u00a3399.\nOn the home theatre front we have Q Acoustics Q-AV System, which\nutilises a slim sound bar form factor to produce the front channels.\nEach of the front speakers are mounted on a telescopic frame so that\nthe entire bar can extend to match the width of the TV, and the two\ncurved speakers at the back give an \u2018ultra-wide\u2019 sound-field, giving the\nflexibility of their positioning. But the real gem of all this is the Balanced Mode Radiator (BMR) technology by NXT, allowing the use of\nflat panel diaphragm to achieve the shallow chassis and extended band-width. Officially the whole system retails for \u00a3600, but most shops sell\nthem for around \u00a3560.\nAnother big home-theatre related news: not too long ago Sonos, the\nmaker of the famous multi\u2013room music system, released an app for the\niPhone to let you control your music stream to different rooms. The\ndemo I was given at the show was very straightforward to use, with an\ninterface similar to the company\u2019s own remote control. You can see a\nvideo demo on my YouTube page: http://is.gd/6goK\nAs for the Sonos system, packages start from \u00a3399.\n\n"

I\u2019m perplexed. Do they\nnot enjoy spouting pure nonsense and\nforcing their ideals on impressionable\nothers? Not that I\u2019m suggesting you\nlot are impressionable. Because you\u2019re\nnot. That\u2019s right. You are not. Now get\nme a box of dougnuts.\nWhat I had written for this column\nsomehow turned into the main article.\nAsk me how, and it\u2019s actually a simple\nexplanation. I apparently had more to\nsay than I thought about the US elections this week. So transfer your eyes\nupwards and about 3 centimetres to\nthe right after you\u2019ve finished reading\nthis column, but not a word sooner.\nOtherwise there will be consequences\nof kinds unimaginable to the perfectly aligned minds of the average\nImperialite.\nI\u2019m not entirely sure I have the gravi-tas to be as patronising as I am, but\nafter reading the last two paragraphs I\nthink I\u2019m alright with it. Being a thicko\nin a university crammed with geniuses\nand future world-leaders somehow\ngives me the idea that maybe I can say\nthings so stupid, you\u2019ll all be too clever\nto understand. It\u2019ll happen, and you\u2018ll\nsay I\u2019m a poor writer, but I\u2019m just an\nacademically disadvantaged writer.\nOn a completely unrelated, but generally more relevant note, Marks and\nSpencer announced record fall in profits this week. The British high street\nmainstay has already gone through\nan extremely turbulent period in recent past, only to be revamped by a\nsickeningly over-indulgent advertising\ncampaign that many simply deemed\n\u2018food-sex\u2019. However, I\u2019m unconvinced\nthe clothing side of the business has\nchanged all that much since. A more\nmodern and younger demographic\nwas aimed at, and to a certain extent,\nit worked. The introduction of external fashion houses into the M&S brand\ncontributed to a greater number of 20-30 year old women shopping there.\nDespite the influx of numerous high-profile celebrities including Myleene\nKlass, Lily Cole and Erin O\u2019Connor, the\nstrategy obviously isn\u2019t working any-more, what with the credit crunch and\nthat. M&S now reveal their new \u2018Portfolio\u2019 range aimed at the 45+ demo-graphic. They claim they have found a\nniche in the market, but this niche was\nonly formed when M&S abandoned\ntheir marketing and usual middle-aged\ndemographic those years ago. Basically, they are refilling their own niche\nthey decided to abaondon for greener\npastures. Except the pastures were not\ngreener, just better for the first chew\nand not much else after.\nThe new 43-acre Westfield shopping\nmall opened this week. Apparently it\u2019s\na similar experience to trying to shop\nwhilst being a pilchard in a tin. No air,\nsmelly, and no room. Wait a month\nor two, and utilize the fact the mindless drones have all gone to Westfield,\nand have a slightly more serene shop\nelsewhere.\nAs I write, Obama is 175 to McCain\u2019s\n76. O-BA-MA! O-BA-MA! Meh.\nFashioning the vote\nDaniel Wan isn\u2019t voting or listening, but is watching sceptically\nA\nt the time of writing,\nit\u2019s the night of the US\npresidential elections\nandGeorgeDubyaBush\nis still sitting comfortably in the White House. Nevertheless,\nthe result is irrelevant. If opinion polls\nfollow through, an assured victory for\nthe fanfare that is the Obama-Biden\ncamp.\nI\u2019m fairly confused about whether I\nshould dearly care about the elections\nor not. The whole thing is completely\nout of my control; I am not eligible to\nvote and hence I cannot voice my fraction of an overall preference. I find it\nmarginally amusing that so many people in the UK have jumped onto the\nObama-bandwagon as it merrily trundles across the globe. He is an icon plastered across countless celebrity attire,\nand this is what, in my humble opinion,\ncheapens the worth of the Presidential\nelections. His elevated celebrity status\nis less to do with his policies, but what\nhe represents. Is that purely enough to\ndeserve one of the most powerful positions in world politics?\nParis Fashion Week was a wonderful\nexample of this. Two prominent designers sent out their models adorning\npieces heavily and obviously laden with\nan attempt at political connotation. Sonia Rykiel unveiled a preppy knit dress\nwith the five letters that will become an\never-present fixture in our newspapers\nand minds for years to come. O-B-AM-A. A clear statement of fickle sup-port, but what else?\nJean Charles de Castelbajac, revealed\nhis sequence centre-piece dress (pic-tured) featuring Obama Barack\u2019s instantly alluring eyes and grin. On the\nback, Obama\u2019s take on the infamous\nbut clich\u00e9d quote, \u201cI have a dream today,\u201d further makes this piece look like\nsomething made by a slightly unhinged\nfan. Something that a crazed Madonna\nfan would make and wear to one of her\nconcerts. However, it was not a product of home craft. This was not some\nsmall-time designer trying to leave a\nmark on the adoring world of fashion,\nbut a designer of international stand-ing. His reasoning behind the Obama\ninspired piece was down to the Democrat being the \u201cincarnate of hope,\nchanges and youth.\u201d Political connotation seems to validate this otherwise\naesthetically uninspiring dress.\nBut maybe I am in the minority that\nis so unwelcoming to this new wave\nof politics-fashion hybridisation. De\nCastelbajac was \u201camazed\u201d by not only\nthe ovation the dress received but by\nnegative and \u201cinsulting\u201d Republican\nresponse \u201cfrom the United States.\u201d\nThe fact that the only voiced negative\nresponse he received was from the US\nshows that maybe it is only the Americans that truly care about the elections\nand the rest of us are simply on the\nbandwagon of glamour, fame and fortune it all brings.\nIt is not exactly the first time we have\nseen a political figure feature so heavily within fashion. The most observable example is that of Che Guevara.\nThe easily recognizable image of his\nslightly cocked head is plastered across\nmaterials across the globe. I am not denying it is a powerful image, but when\nit goes beyond the aesthetic power of\nit, I doubt the vast majority of wearers will know why Che Guevara was so\nsignificant in South American history.\nIn hindsight, it is ironic that he has effectively been subsumed by a capitalist\nconsumer culture he came to loath.\nNow that it is firmly established politics has a role in each fashion\u2019s wide\nspectrum, it is not surprising it works\nconversely. Politicians and their associates need to look good. This used to\nmean a smart suit or a respectable un-revealing dress suit. Where their greater interest lies, the public are to be seen\npaying attention in what the figures are\nwearing and not what they stand for.\nIt is now a prominent issue that what\npolitical figures are wearing in public\nview is another factor into the voting\nswing. Over in the US, the Republicans\nhave been getting it horrifically wrong.\nJohnMcCain\u2019swifeCindyrecentlywore\n\u00a3140,000 diamond earrings and an Oscar de la Renta gown costing \u00a31,500 to\na rally. McCain\u2019s running mate, Sarah\nPalin is reported to have spent nearly\n\u00a3100,000 on a new wardrobe, including\nChristian Dior and Valentino pieces,\nfor the 2008 election campaign. These\ndisplays of luxury was in stark contrast\nto the financial turbulence their nation\nis experiencing, and it did not go unnoticed by the public and media.\nBarack Obama on the other hand\nhas been keeping tabs and has acted\naccordingly. His suits pertain to the\nexpectations of the American public,\nbut he manages to do it with a certain\npanache rarely seen in a politician. His\nsuits are not from Dior, but apparently Barney\u2019s. With a simple slim-cut\nsuit and block colour tapered ties, he\nclaims they are \u201cfairly standard\u201d smart\ndress. Despite the ever-growing importance of image in politics, Obama\nmaintains that voters are \u201c[not] too\nworried about what [he\u2019s] wearing.\u201d\nIn Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s case, it is his First\nLady that has been under the fashionista\u2019s scrutiny. Carla Bruni\u2019s beauty and\nstyle has done no harm to her spouse\u2019s\nreputation. She has single-handedly\nmanaged to make a French politician\nremotely likable to the British public.\nActually, I lie. The British public adore\nher, and recently voted her \u2018coolest celebrity of the year.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how\nthe moronic idea of \u2018cool\u2019 was defined\nwhen they were producing this poll,\nbut it\u2019s actually irrelevant. He fact she\nhas been voted as the superlative of\ncool whilst being a political figure of\na traditionally rival nation speaks volumes about the influence of fashion in\npolitics, and weirdly enough, international relations.\nSo maybe, fashion is indeed what\nJean Charles de Castelbajac claims: a\n\u201cpowerful medium\u201d in times of political examination like these.\nViva South Westerly shopping\nSwiri Konje moves down to the ground, then upwards a bit to French soles.\n\u201cKICK OFF YOUR HEELS\u201d and welcome to the wonderful world of French Sole flats.\nAfter going through multiple streets and entering an array of stores, I chanced upon\nFrench Sole. As I entered, I was received in a polite and professional manner by\nstaff. The place was full of FLATS, FLATS and FLATS. Each was of a distinguishable\ncolour, shape and design ranging from ballet flats, loafers, to comfortable driving\nshoes. With the odd bag and boots thrown in, it was full of colour and style, ensuring that you won\u2019t see someone else\nwearing your flats.\nDespite its appearance in many magazines such as Vogue, in which their shoes were described as \u2018Prettiest Ballet Flats\nAround\u2019, prices are of the middle class ranging from \u00a350 - \u00a3100, but no student discount is offered.\nThe marathon in San Francisco, run every year on third Sunday in May, which apparently is colourful, fun, mad and\ncrazy, was the \u2018Muse\u2019 for Jane Winkworth\u2019s latest collection. They represent peace, love harmony and survival. If you\nhappen to hate America, rest assured the shoes are not American, so buy and wear at free will! After all, it might bring\nsome harmony and love in your life. Moreover, different designs have different names. Achieve celebrity style for less\nwith the Madonna inspired and named shoes.\nIt\u2019s winter, and we don\u2019t want those dreary black boots again. Bring in the colours by wearing their amazing \u2018Peace, Joy\nand Love\u2019 shoes, teaming them with amazing leg warmers. Trust me; you will be the envy of every girl. Guys, you can\ntry them too!\nThey have two stores in the SWs, one on Ellis Street near Sloane Square, and the newly opened King\u2019s Road boutique.\nNext week, I\u2019ll be picking out one of my favourite shops to go accessory picking.\nMC Hammer Pants\nAs much of a classic as \u201cCan\u2019t\nTouch This\u201d was and is, MC\nHammer dressed like a tool.\nI\u2019d go as far to say he dressed\nlike fucking tool. However, this\ndoes not distract us away from\nthe fact that the aptly named\n\u2018hammer pants\u2019 are on the\nrunways of 2008, and hence\nback in fashion. It\u2019s Hammer\nTime. But that doesn\u2019t mean\nit\u2019s acceptable to dance like\nhim either.\nWhitening Hair\nI saw Keith Murray, lead singer\nof We Are Scientists, recently.\nHe has whitening hair and\npulls it off. Agree? Well, I don\u2019t\ncare if you don\u2019t. With the risk\nof looking like Rogue from XMen, white hairs can be sexy.\nStilettos\nStilettos are fine, as long as\nyou don\u2019t complain about\nhow uncomfortable they are\nor how your feet are \u201ckilling\nyou.\u201d You decided to wear\nthem out, so I have no pity\nthat your feet now look like\ngiant swollen sweet potatoes.\nI\u2019m not carrying you home\nonce you\u2019ve taken them off.\nYou can step in glass and dog\nshit all you want, its your own\nfault for not wearing flats.\nSICK\nSHIT\nLeft to right: Charles Jean de Castelbajac\u2019s Yes to Obama piece, Carla Bruni and Sophie Rykiel\u2019s knit dress\n6 Ellis Street,\nLondon, SW1X 9AL\n020 7730 3771\n323 Kings Road,\nLondon, SW3 5EP\n020 7351 1634\n\n"

Global Financial Crisis. Britain on\nthe brink of recession. We\nare told we are facing the\nconsequences of over-borrowing. But is there a deeper flaw?\nIs the monetary system inherently\ncausing an Economic Genocide?\nAs part of the AhlulBayt Islamic\nSociety\u2019s current campaign to raise\nawareness about the Economic Crisis,\nstudents of all faiths and backgrounds\nconvened in the Clore Lecture Theatre\nlast Thursday to discuss the topic in\nmore depth. Toufic Machnouk, Executive Director of the Institute for Policy\nResearch and Development, aimed to\nclarify the nature of the crisis, focusing\non three main factors often misunderstood by the average Joe: the ownership of wealth, the monetary structure\nand the Islamic perspective on these\ntwo systems.\nThe talk sent an alarming message,\nimplying that the problem is in the\n\u2018credit\u2019 rather than the \u2018crunch.\u2019 While\nsome governments seem to think we\ncan fight fire with fire and \u2018borrow our\nway out of this\u2019, Mr. Machnouk suggested otherwise. The problem, he im-plied, lies in the ownership of wealth.\nYou know something is wrong when\nthe poorest half of the world\u2019s population own just 1% of the world\u2019s wealth\nand when the richest three men on the\nplanet are worth the equivalent of the\ntotal GDP of the 48 poorest nations.\nAccording to Mr. Machnouk, combining wealth ownership inequalities\nwith a flawed monetary structure concocts a lethal mixture. So lethal, in fact,\nthat it has led to the deaths of more\nchildren than the number of deaths\ncaused by World War I. Interestingly,\n97% of \u2018money\u2019 today is created by private banks in interest. However, when\none pauses to ask where all this money\ncame from, there is an eery silence. In\nfact the majority of this money is not\nin circulation but in the form of digits\nin computers. No wonder we can\u2019t pay\nit back. So why has this never been a\nproblem up till now? The speaker likened the system to a game of musical\nSo you\u2019re thinking of a career in law\nbut you haven\u2019t got a clue what is actually involves and how you can get\ninto it. I was in your exact position two\nyears ago, back when I was blissfully\nignorant of how quickly your graduation year creeps up on you and everyone from distant relatives to friends\nyou haven\u2019t seen for a few months demands to know which career path you\nhave chosen to devote yourself to.\nI did the typical IC physicist thing\nand interned in a bank following my\nsecond year and decided the world of\nwining and dining potential Russian\noligarchs in the faint hope they will\ngive me their money to play with was\nnot for me.\nI panicked that my dream of prancing around the City in a nice suit and\nhigh heels would never be fulfilled\nuntil I stumbled upon a law firm presentation at Imperial (actually, I got the\nwrong room initially and sat through\nhalf an hour of bridge building chat\nuntil I realised the law firm talk was\nthree doors down).\nDespite missing the first half an hour,\nit dawned upon me that this particular career path would lead to both my\nnice suit and a job where I\u2019d be able to\nuse my brain as well. Science graduates are very popular for Intellectual\nProperty work (arguments over whose\nidea something was and who should\nreap the benefits e.g. recent Barbie and\nBratz case) because cases often require\na knowledge of science to determine\nwhether item A is in fact exactly the\nsame as item B released by a rival company a year ago. More generally, they\nseem to be very impressed by our fabulous intelligence with the belief that if\nwe can survive 3-4 years of grilling at\nIC then taking on the world of corporate law will be a breeze.\nAsking around, I discovered that law\nfirms do summer vacation schemes\njust like banks (except much shorter so\nyou still have a summer holiday) and\nthat this is the best way to determine if\nyou\u2019d enjoy this kind of work \u2013 seeing\nthe business\u2019 dirty coffee mugs and all\nfrom the inside. To convert from a sci-When The City\nfails, join The Old\nBailey\nDaria Nakariakova ence subject all that is needed is a year-long GDL (Graduate Diploma in Law)\nand then another year LPC (Legal Practice Course), which law graduates have\nto do too, and if you secure a training\ncontract with a firm they pay for it all.\nI spent some time shut up in my room\ninventing answers to \u2018Describe a time\nwhen you showed initiative...\u2019 etc. and\na few months later found myself with\n2 vac schemes (as the cool people call\nthem) for this summer.\nBoth were at City corporate law\nfirms. Unlike my time spent in the\nbank, this experience did not put me\noff a career in law, quite the opposite;\nI\u2019m already planning my lawyer out-fits! Contrary to popular belief, I was\nnot buried under piles of photocopying for two weeks. I spent three days\nin the Court of Appeals listening to a\nnasty man being accused of all sorts of\nbad deeds (the nasty man\u2019s bank was\na client of the firm and so they were\ninvolved indirectly and we were there\nincognito. Sadly, I did not get to wear a\ntrench coat and shades).\nThe judges really do wear wigs and\nthe barristers really do make barely\ndisguised scathing remarks to each\nother. It was great fun.\nAt the second firm my buddy, who\nis a trainee lawyer (the position occupied for 2 years until your qualify),\nwas solely responsible for a case of a\nmobile phone provider client being\nsued by a particularly annoying client.\nI found relevant pieces of law, helped\nto write a sneering email to the man\u2019s\nlawyers accusing them of being useless and compiled the files of evidence\nto be presented by our barrister to the\njudges at the hearing itself.\nHaving decided that I love the work\nbut want to work in a bigger and more\nsuccessful firm I got a job as campus\nmanager for Herbert Smith for this\nacademic year.\nThe big event is Thursday 20th November, location is yet to be decied.\nIf you want to find out what a career\nin one of the top corporate law firms in\nthe world, please come along.\nSend an email to dn305@ic.ac.uk to\nsign up and I\u2019ll see you there over a free\ndrink!\nchairs: so long as the music is playing,\neveryone is fine. When it stops, somebody has to lose.\nMr. Machnouk went on to talk of the\nglobal effect that the crisis has had,\nwith poorer countries strangled by unpaid debts. Unfortunately, this perpetual debt can only be sustained by perpetual growth. The speaker described\nit as like charging you for the air you\nbreathe whilst simultaneously asking\nyou for a part of your lung for each\nbreath you take. These countries are\nforced into IMF loans, which seem like\nan idyllic escape at the time. However,\nthe structural adjustment programmes\nattached to the loans ensure the loan\nmoney disappears to private and foreign investors, leaving the impoverished nations to clean up the mess.\nAnd pay back the loans, of course. It\ncomes as no surprise that all nations\ngiven IMF loans showed a decline in\n17 key indicators in the years after they\nreceived the loans. Therefore it is also\nnot surprising that half of the world\u2019s\npopulation now live in absolute pov-erty, earning under $2 a day.\nMr. Machnouk concluded with the\nIslamic perspective on the issue. With\nthe Arabic word for \u2018Economics\u2019 stemming from the word \u2018Equality\u2019, in Islam\nwealth is nothing but a trust from God\nand the policies in place attempt to ensure fairness and justice in transactions\nand the financial system. Be it through\nthe prohibition of hoarding wealth or\nthe elimination of interest, Islam aims\nto reach a state where wealth is not the\ngoal, rather a means to satisfaction.\nHowever questions were raised in the\nfollowing Q&A session as to how Islamic many so-called Muslim nations\u2019\neconomies are today.\nIn conclusion, the talk was a very interesting take on a system that has affected and will continue to have a major impact on all of us. It was engaging\nto hear a religious view on a system not\noften linked to religion and the speaker\u2019s eloquence and the Q&A session\nprovided an opportunity for further\ndiscussion.\nThe crowds begin to gather in the lecture theatre\nPoster of the event by AhlulBaty Islamic Society\nEven if you do lose your hair through stress, you can wear these lovely\nwigs to cover it up\n\n"

The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink\ngrid is by drawing crosses around any\nzeros. Drawing crosses is purely done\nto so that you know where there can\u2019t\npossibly be a line. So, take the pattern\nbelow as an example.

I don\u2019t do\nanything to correct this (letting them\nmake assumptions isn\u2019t really lying!),\nbut take advantage of the fact that being \u2018famous\u2019 gives people even more\nreason to talk to me and buy me drinks\nto keep me sweet! I\u2019ve even been known\nto swing a few freebies and VIP areas\nwhile out in the clubs of West London.\nMy advice is simply to neither confirm\nnor deny that you are from X-Factor,\nbut to let them assume you are and\ntreat you accordingly.

This is an incredible endurance test where racers all start together\nregatta style, but have to maintain\npower and technique over the entire\nhead race course. The eerie stillness\nand crisp cold air felt along Putney\nEmbankment was reflective of the\nmood in anticipation of this race for\nthe title of amateur sculling Champion\nof the Thames and Great Britain. Dating back to 1830 this race is one of the\nmost physical and mental challenges a\nsculler can face and only a select few\ncompete each year. ICBC, the home of\ntideway rowing, accounted for three of\nthe five entries.\nThe final line-up was immense:\nMahe Drysdale of New Zealand representing Tideway Scullers, a three\ntime World Champion just returned\nfrom the Olympics. Drysdale\u2019s steely\ndetermination won him a bronze medal in Beijing despite suffering badly\nfrom an infection throughout the race\nand needing to be carried via a life raft\nout of his boat.\nRichard Ockendon of Molesey BC,\nGB trialist and winner of the S1 4x- at\nfour\u2019s head of the river race in 2005\nwith this year\u2019s Olympic gold medallist\nAndy Triggs Hodge.\n3 of ICBC\u2019s elite scullers: Simon Hislop, Adam Freeman-Pask and George\nWhittaker. Hislop and Whittaker were\nwinning crewmates in this year\u2019s Visitor\u2019s Challenge Cup at Henley while\nHislop and Freeman-Pask were winner\u2019s of the Pair\u2019s Head a few weeks\nago. Whittaker was also last year\u2019s\nsculler\u2019s head of the river winner while\nFreeman-Pask raced for GB at the Senior World Championships at Linz over\nthe summer. It was set-up to be an epic\nshowdown and did not disappoint.\nTension mounted with some brief\nwarm-up sprints from the competitors\nand soon it was almost time for com-bat. The 5 racers positioned themselves\nin nervous anticipation of the start\ncall. Like lambs to the slaughter, there\nCristina Duffy was no helping them now. Without\ndelay attention was called and silence\nfell across the river. Steering launches\nawaited facing their racers. Blade to\nblade and man to man, this is the stuff\nof legends. The gentle ebb of the tide-way bobbed the scullers as they came\nforward to frontstops, hearts pound-ing. Onlookers watched with bated\nbreath, fingers anxiously hovering over\ncamera shutter buttons. GO!\nThe peaceful serenity was shattered.\nThe five scullers blasted off unleashing\nall the energy their last minute cereal\nbars had provided. Engines roared as\nlaunches took-off after the racers and\nstreams of v-shaped wash spread be-hind. Thus began what would be over\n20 minutes of intense wrestling against\neach other, against the overwhelming\nfeeling of muscle ache and against the\nmost unpredictable of all: mother na-ture. But Imperial was well prepared\nfor all these potential saboteurs and\ntook the early lead with Freeman-Pask\nsqueezing in front.\nThere was little between all five\ncompetitors for the first 100 metres\nbut eventually Drysdale settled into a\nsteady rhythm and slipped into pole\nposition.\nAll racers took the inside line on the\nSurrey side bar Ockendon who kept\nwide for a good part of the course.\nThe Surrey four stuck close in the in-tial stages causing much hand waving\nfrom the steering launches attempting to prevent clashes between boats.\nThrough Hammersmith Bridge the\nfield had spread with Drysdale still\nmaintaining his lead but being chased\ndown by Freeman-Pask and Whittaker. A break in the clouds past Barnes\nBridge sent sharp sunlight down on the\nsculler\u2019s backs making racing lines difficult to determine against the glare.\nIn the closing stages Drysdale was\nclinging to his lead as Whittaker\nstrengthened for the finish gaining water on each stroke as they approached\nChiswick Bridge. With the gruelling\nrace nearly at an end the 5 racers emptied what was left in the tanks and gallantly sprinted for home. The finishing order remained the order that was\nheld throughout the majority of the\nDrysdale is pushed by 3 ICBC scullers\nrace with Drysdale winning in 21:14,\nWhittaker second in 21:22 and Freeman-Pask third in 21:34. With the line\ncrossed there was little celebration as\npure exhaustion consumed the racers\nwho gave a terrific performance on the\nday. This year\u2019s GB Olympic bronze\nmedallist Elise Laverick made the presentations to Drysdale, as well as to Sophie Hosking (London RC) who won\nthe women\u2019s race in 22:05.\nImperial\u2019s performance is a testament to the commitment coaches Steve Trapmore and Stuart Whitelaw have\nshown to the three scullers in preparation for the racing season. Whittaker\u2019s performance was particularly\nexceptional giving nothing to Drysdale\nwho had to fight hard to keep the lead\nthroughout.\nICBC will have crews participating in\nthe Four\u2019s Head of the River Race next\nSaturday 8th November over the same\ncourse but beginning in Mortlake and\nending in Putney. This is a spectacular event with over 500 boats passing\nover the course from 10:30am. All support is welcome with vantage points at\nHammersmith Bridge and Putney Embankment recommended.\nFinishing order: Mahe Drysdale\n[Tideway Sculler\u2019s] (21:14), George\nWhittaker [ICBC] (21:22), Adam\nFreeman-Pask [ICBC] (21:34), Richard\nOckendon [Molesley] (21:42), Simon\nHislop [ICBC] (21:52).\nContinued from back page\nStage 6, 25km unfortunately began\nfor me where stage 5 had finished\nthanks mostly to lack of sleep due to\nsleeping on sprung sports-hall floors\nand too many 5am starts. It was, how-ever, the team\u2019s best race in the com-petition; we finished 4th mixed pair,\n26 seconds behind second place in the\nmixed category, and came in before the\nleading women\u2019s team. Neil enjoyed the\nmist because it wasn\u2019t sunshine, and I\nonly got up the one continuous 1922m\nclimb relying on Neil\u2019s encouragement\nand my own mild hysteria. I suddenly\nbecame a convert to sports massages\nafter this stage.\nThe team discovered on the morning of stage 7 that the marathon-length\nand 2788m climb stage race that was\nthe planned route had been turned\ninto plan B because storms were expected in the afternoon. These storms\nnever appeared but the organisers\nwere justifiably taking no risks (since\nthe end of the TAR this year there has\nbeen a mountain-running race in Germany where a sudden blizzard caused\nseveral deaths). The team was counting the big climbs to go until the end\nof stage 8 but still appreciating the fantastic scenery the route went through\nin the Sud-Tirol.\nThe 8th stage was 34km and 2120m\nascent through the Dolomites. After\ntwo major climbs on scree, it included\n5km of high-level running at 2400m\nskirting around the Tre Cime before\nthe last descent into Sesto. Neil\u2019s Achilles\u2019 tendon pain made sure the last\nstage was not easy going, but the team\nplaced 8th, coming in well over the required 5 minutes ahead of their closest rivals in the overall ranking, which\ngave them a final position of 7th.\nTeam Imperial College London\nwould like to thank the Imperial College Trust for their grant to help the\nteam cover entry costs, High5 (www.\nhighfive.co.uk) for their discounts on\nsports nutrition, and the ICU Outdoor\nClub for a contribution from the Competition Entry fund.

It said, \u2018I\nhave a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where\nthey will not be judged by the colour\nof their skin but by the content of their\ncharacter\u2019 (Martin Luther King, 1963).\nMy friend is a British Pakistani who\nworks in Politics and has literary ambi-tion: I was surprised that he resorted\nto the words of someone else which,\npowerful though they are, to my white,\nmiddle-class ears, have been repeated\nso often as to become almost clich\u00e9.\nIt was exciting at 5am this morning.\nIt was exciting to see the election of a\npresident who, whatever you think of\nhim, is not simply a replica of something which has come before. It was exciting to see so many people motivated\nby the promise of change, mobilised in\ntheir thousands to a park in Chicago\nand stirred into a frenzy worthy of\na pop star, by politics of all things. It\nwas exciting, and also a little scary. It\nwas scary to see the negative reaction\nof Republicans at their headquarters\nin Arizona, booing every time Obama\nwas mentioned in McCain\u2019s concession speech. It was scary to look into\na future which is a complete unknown,\nwith the promise of \u2018Change\u2019. Human\nbeings are creatures of habit. We do\nnot like change.\nBut regardless of your political pref-erence,somethingalreadyhaschanged.\nMcCain last night silenced his dissenting crowd with the following words;\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural, tonight, to feel some dis-appointment. But tomorrow, we must\nmove beyond it and work together to\nget our country moving again\u201d. Obama\ncelebrated his victory by urging the\ncrowds to \u201csummon a new spirit of\npatriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch\nin and work harder and look after not\nonly ourselves, but each other\u201d. This is\na new politics, not one man on a stage\npromising the moon (although it is\nsurely impossible to achieve all that\nObama has promised), but two men,\nfrom opposing political parties saying\n\u2018look, it can be good, but we have to do\nit together. There is no magic wand,\njust you and me\u2019. \u201cI will listen to you,\nespecially when we disagree\u201d he says,\nand this is what makes me hope.\nMy boyfriend has a postcard in his\noffice, which says \u2018Hate something,\nchange something\u2019, and this is what to\nme, Obama really stands for, behind\nthe healthcare and the repealing of\nBush\u2019s tax rebates and whatever other\npolicies you may or may not believe\nin. As Shami Chakrabarti, director of\nLiberty, so eloquently said on Desert\nIsland Disks- if she wasn\u2019t doing the\njob she does, she would just be sitting\nin the pub with her mates, complaining\nabout the very things she campaigns so\nvociferously on: Guantanamo bay, 48\ndays, etc. Obama, in the words of McCain, \u201cinspired the hopes of so many\nmillions of Americans who had once\nwrongly believed that they had little at\nstake or little influence in the election\nof an American president\u201d.\nHe may not be in charge of our country (political jokes aside) or even your\nchoice of President, but let him inspire\nyou to make change, to have influ-ence. Go on demonstrations. Write\nletters to your MP, to the Mayor, to\nthe train company who held you up\nfor three hours last Sunday.

So I got up and joined\nthe others my age after winning a \u201cno\nyou sit down\u201d battle with a woman so\nold that I think she might have been\npresent at Churchill\u2019s birth, and I don\u2019t\nmean the nodding dog.\nSuddenly, \u201cCOULD ANYONE\nWITH MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE\nPLEASE COME TO CARRIAGE 6\u201d\ncame the unusually clear voice over the\ntrain\u2019s PA system.\nA part of my brain raced and thought\n\u201cwow! I can help someone, I think I\ncan!\u201d but then decided against it, as\nI thought that the best thing I could\nprobably do is diagnose what is wrong\nwith this patient and if he or she was\ndying, I\u2019d probably only be able to turn\naround and explain what and how\nthis patient is dying from, seeing as I\ndon\u2019t have the necessary equipment\nto provide any help. It\u2019s not as if I walk\naround with a bag of pharmaceuticals\nand syringes and surgical equipment,\nso I re-engaged my brain to try and\nwork out how I can finish the sudoku\nin the newspaper.\nThe small twinge of guilt brought\nabout by my inaction was put to rest\nwhen an unusually pierced woman\ncame through with an air of importance politely ushering us common\nfolk out of the way to tend to this\nemergency.\nI barely had time to write down the\nnext number on my puzzle when I\nheard a booming \u201cGET OUT OF THE\nWAY, EXCUSE ME, MOVE! I DON\u201dT\nMEAN TO BE RUDE BUT THIS IS\nAN EMERGENCY\u201d as three doctors\nliterally shoved those who were too\nslow aside.\nI\u2019m ashamed to say this, but they\nseemed like the adult versions of some\nof my colleagues at ICSM.\nHowever, that was not my first\nthought, as my first thought began with\nW and rhymed with banker. As I looked\naround, people\u2019s faces and mumbling\nwere in sync with my thoughts of dis-approval, but then people began to audibly try to make excuses for such an\narrogantly rude act.\n\u201cHe is a doctor and I suppose he\ncould help\u201d and others along similar\nlines\nBut why should that fact that you\nmay be able to help someone in need\ngive the right to treat the rest of the\ncarriage like a nuisance and to shove\nthem around like they are intentionally\nantagonising your effort to do good.\nWhat I think nailed this doctor\u2019s performance was the fact that he proceeded to voluntarily tell every member of\nthe train on his way back \u201cIt\u2019s only an\nepileptic fit, no need to worry\u201d in the\nloudest voice you could imagine.\nAs a medic, I have had the unique\nchance to observe our species from the\noutside, as it were, and I would like to\ntake this opportunity to say to ICSM:\nbe humble, you\u2019re studying for a job at\nthe end of the day, like every body else.\nYou shouldn\u2019t moan that you\u2019re doing\nsix years because you knew that when\nyou applied, no one surprised you with\nthat information towards the end of\nyour third year!\nAnd to the rest of Imperial: On behalf of all medics, past and present, if\nyou see us act like that, sorry, we don\u2019t\ntry to be arrogant, we\u2019re just simple.\nA lesson for all train-using Medics\nThe Watcher\nSo this is Christmas, tell me what have\nyou done? A year has gone by, you are\nsingle again? If like me, you recently\nbroke up with your girl/boyfriend,\nhopefully not both simultaneously, you\nwould perhaps empathise with me (but\ndon\u2019t sympathise, I\u2019m doing fine\u2026 re-ally). In fact, I\u2019m not lamenting over\nmy ex who shall remain shameless; I\nmeant nameless. I\u2019m here to preach to\nall those chaps left stranded by a cheating and emotionally retarded witch,\nthat it\u2019s perfectly manly to feel down.\nHaving spent five years at Imperial\nas a Medic, I have taken more abuse\nthan you did free pens from the career\nfairs and know our motherland college\nbetter than Obama knows the names\nof plumbers. Over the years, amidst\narticles on the common paraphernalia\nof life, these threads preferred to comment on courting the opposite sex and\nstarting a relationship. But I\u2019m sure\nthat\u2019s not where our problems lie as\nbright motivated Imperial guys (cough\ncough, doctor I have a cold). Keeping\nit (the relationship) up is the difficult\nthing. So this is about things that happen when the romantic bulls**t goes\ncleavage-up. Come on, flowers and\ndinners just don\u2019t cut it anymore.

Of course, this is\nwhat the polls say. I have the suspicion\nthat racism may yet have its Austerlitz and the senile reactionary and his\ninsane religious entourage will punch\nthrough the centre of their enemy\u2019s\nlines and once again be in a position\nto suppress all the benevolent changes\nthat the charming young man of the\nDemocratic Party intends to bring\nabout.\nPersonally, I\u2019m betting on the good\nSenator to win.

A\nfree tip for you: the best time to sell\nwould be during the turnip winter of\n1916.\nCurrently, a thousand weak-willed,\nintolerable and utterly non-American\nliberals are running around telling me\nto vote for that infernal demagogue\nthat has captured their unable-to-vote-in-the-American-election hearts.\nSo desirous are they that the heroic\nand wise old man be defeated by that\ninexperienced parvenu that they are\ndoing everything in their power to tell\nAmericans how to vote. It is on their\nfacebook, it is on their T-shirts, it is\non the tip of their tongues at every\nsingle moment. Like how the Guardian encouraged its readers to write letters to Americans in swing states that\nessentially ordered them to vote for\nJohn Kerry (encouraging most of the\nrecipients to vote for Bush if you did\nnot see that coming), these irrelevant\nxenos are busy trying to do everything\nthey interfere in the national American\ndemocratic process.\nBy the time you read this, those same\nlovely, well-intentioned people will either be in an ecstasy of delight, choking beneath the weight of their own\nsense of self-satisfaction, or they will\nbe distraught, rightly commiserating\nthe loss of a momentous opportunity\nfor America. But whatever their feel-ings, it is none of their business. It\nhas nothing to do with them. The way\nsome people discuss the matter, you\nwould think they would not be content\nuntil the Americans abstained from\nvoting and handed over all responsibility for the appointment of their leaders\nto the international community. Before\nsuch an idea encourages the sort of elation in you that would encourage your\nneighbour to shuffle away (or possibly\nshuffle closer and tell you how they had\nalways secretly hoped that you felt the\nsame way about them) then let me tell\nyou that the Americans are not going\nto do that, at least not any time soon.\nReally, this election is no business of\nyours. If you are not American, please\nin future do not tell Americans what to\nthink or do with their own country. It\nis only giving them attention after all.\nThey were always destined to have awful leaders from the moment they fell\ninto that fit of madness that motivated\nthem to rid themselves of our glorious Monarchy. Let them make their\nbad decisions. Let them vote for the\ngentle elderly gentleman whose reactionary policies will inevitably destroy\nAmerica.

Based heavily\non Fleming\u2019s novel and featuring many\nalluring women and dastardly villains,\nas well as an exciting and hilarious car\nchase, this was the first Bond film that\nhad something for everyone.\nHighlights include: Sexuality shifting Bond girl Pussy Galore, Bond villain\nOddjob with his flying bowler hat, the\nlaser beam scene, an ejector seat in the\nAston Martin, Goldfinger being sucked\nout of an aeroplane, Jill Masterson being painted from head to toe in gold.\nMemorable quote: Goldfinger to\nBond: \u201cNo Mr Bond, I expect you to\ndie!\u201d\nBest Bond bit: Bond\u2019s fight with\nOddjob inside Fort Knox.\nRoger Moore Pierce Brosnan\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFriday 07 November 2008 felix\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n22 felix Friday 07 November 2008\nFilm\nFilm Editors \u2013 Zuzanna Blaszczak and Jonathan Dakin\nBond is back, but this time he\u2019s a bit bland\nGee, I\u2019m starving for more\nHunger is the directorial debut of\nTurner prize-winning artist Steve McQueen. The film is centred around\nthe IRA hunger strikes of 1981, and in\nparticular Bobby Sands MP (Michael\nFassbender), the leader of the hunger\nstrikes. The hunger strikes were the\nIRA\u2019s final effort to be granted political\nstatus, to be recognised as prisoners of\nwar rather than ordinary criminals.\nFrom the mid-1970s the then Labour\ngovernment had withdrawn political\nstatus from Irish republican prisoners\nin order to disguise the true nature of\nthe conflict in Ireland, to depict what\nwas in truth a national war between\nthe British state and the IRA as a\ncriminal enterprise launched by mad\nrepublicans. In fighting for the return\nof political status, Sands and the others were not simply \u2018making a gesture\u2019,\nthey were taking part in a protest of\nprofound historic importance centred around the question of whether\nthe struggle to expel British forces\nfrom Ireland was legitimate. Sands, of\ncourse, thought it was legitimate. The\nBritish government knew it was a serious war but wanted to present it as\ncriminal activity.\nThe action takes place in the bleakest\nof locations, the H-block of Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Maze in Belfast. Despite\nthe dreary setting, McQueen has made\narguably the most breathtaking film of\nthe year.\nMcQueen is every bit the artist in his\ndebut feature; there is a painstaking attention to detail in every shot. From\nthe breadcrumbs falling on the lap of\nthe disgruntled prison guard as he eats\nhis breakfast (an early warning sign of\nthe \u2018hunger\u2019 that will later follow for\nthe prisoners) to the ominous tattoo of\n\u2018UDA\u2019 on a prison orderly\u2019s knuckles,\neach frame of the film is a work of art.\nMcQueen wonderfully portrays the\ndetermination of the prisoners to win\ntheir POW status and thus re-legiti-Quantum Of Solace HHKKK\nDirector: Marc Forster\nWriter: Paul Haggis et al\nCast: Daniel Craig\nOlga Kurylenko,\nMathieu Amalric\nComing soon:\nWhat does everyone need once they realise that they have seen\ntoo many plodding action films or dreary dramas?

The catch? They haven\u2019t\nspoken to each other for over 20 years!\nWith celebrity cameos including R&B singer John Legend, the\nrecently departed\nsoul singer Isaac\nHayes and Will\nand Grace\u2019s Sean\nHayes, expect\nhilarity to ensue.\nThe film should\nalso be a fitting\ntribute to Bernie\nMac, a very\ntalented comedian who should\nhave done more\ncomedy and less\nOcean\u2019s films.\nThe sound of laughter will abound in\nSoul Men\nHunger HHHHK\nDirector: Steve McQueen\nWriters:Steve McQueen\n\tEdna Walsh\nCast: Michael Fassbender,\nStuart Graham\nmise the Irish war for independence.\nYou can almost smell their unwashed\nbodies and the excrement they spread\non their walls as part of a \u2018dirty protest\u2019\nagainst using prison conveniences or\nwearing prison clothes. There are very\nfew scenes of conversation, in fact, McQueen had originally wanted to make\na film with no dialogue at all. Strip\nsearches, prison beatings, mandatory\nbaths - all take place without talking.\nThe main conversational scene will\ngo down as one of the great cinematic\nmoments of recent times. There is a 22\nminute conversation between Sands\nand Father Dominic Moran (played\nfantastically by Liam Cunningham)\nand a full 17 minutes of it is taken in\none shot where the camera doesn\u2019t\nmove once. Cunningham and Fassbender work together incredibly in this\nshot, as Sands convinces Father Moran\nthat the hunger strike must happen.\nHe is finally granted approval from the\npriest (not that he really needed it) after telling a profoundly touching story\nfrom his childhood. Following this\nconversation, Fassbender\u2019s dedication\nto the role of Sands becomes evident.\nFassbender looks horrendous for\nthe rest of the film. Having whittled\nhis body down to a mere 58kg for the\nstarvation scenes, he is a far cry from\nthe muscle-bound warrior we saw in\nthe CGI thriller 300. For the final 40\nminutes of the film we see Sands\u2019 condition steadily deteriorate, with the development of appalling bedsores and,\naccording to the doctor, the shrinkage\nof his left ventricle to 70 per cent of its\nnormal size.

He is likable, unique in\nhis portrayal of James Bond and \u2013 in\nthis age of Jack Bauer, Jason Bourne\nand numerous other imperfect trained\nkillers \u2013 effective in depicting a secret\nagent at the peak of his ruthless profes-sion. Craig has elevated Bond alongside the other big hitters meaning that\nplaygrounds across the land will be full\nof arguments about which \u2018JB\u2019 would\nwin in a 3-way bout of fisticuffs. But\nthe sixth depiction of Bond represents\na significant transformation for the\nfranchise and whether this change is\nwelcome or not basically comes down\nto personal taste.\nWith Casino Royale the camp portrayals of the past were consigned to\nhistory. Hollywood\u2019s version of Bond\nhad evolved into a human being capable of feelings, emotions and love,\nbut in Quantum of Solace they are\nsubstituted with a burning inner rage\nas he tracks down his ill-fated lover\u2019s\nkillers. This serves as a cue to increase\nthe amount of action in the film but\nat a significant detriment to the plot.\nEven then, the action is often melodramatic rather than exhilarating and is\nfrequently guilty of resorting to obvious CGI and cheap usage of fast editing that obscures the fight scenes leaving your mind to stitch together what\nactually happened. Bond never used\nto be about realism but it was Casino\nRoyale\u2019s main hook. During one scene\nin Quantum of Solace, that harks back\nto the frankly preposterous Die Another Day, Bond comes to within an inch\nof a messy demise saved only by the\nincredible stopping power of his late\nopening parachute.\nWorse still, an angry Bond isn\u2019t a\ntalkative Bond, which doesn\u2019t leave\nmuch room for character develop-ment. Casino Royale dared to portray\na James Bond with feelings, a villain\nthat wasn\u2019t simply a caricature and a\nBond Girl that wasn\u2019t purely tits and\narse. Quantum of Solace dispenses\nwith almost all of this: Mr Greene is a\nfeeble bad-guy who occasionally treats\nhis woman badly in an ineffective plot\ndevice to try and evoke a disgusted\nresponse from the audience, whilst\nthe \u2018traditional\u2019 Bond Girl, played by\nGemma Arterton, is made completely\nredundant by the script. This all leaves\nBond with very little to chat about and\nso he gets on with pursuing and killing one henchman, before gaining a\nlead and pursuing and killing the next\nhenchman and so on and so on. There\nare no tense, tactical mind games with\nthe enemy over a round of poker; instead it\u2019s on with the methodical job of\nchasing down contrived bad guys invented especially to fit the convoluted\nplot, before ultimately stumbling upon\nthe head-honcho\u2019s lair to tell him he\u2019s a\nbad man and exploit the patently obvious chink in his armour.\nQuantum of Solace is by no means\nthe biggest disappointment of the year,\nthat title falls to Indy IV. If you can\ntolerate Quantum of Solace\u2019s inept ex-planations, rinse and repeat story telling and substandard action sequences\nthen you\u2019ll find some enjoyment here.\nOtherwise, it largely feels like a step\nbackwards for Bond \u2013 a franchise and\ncharacter that Daniel Craig appeared\nto be taking in a new direction.\nHas the new Bond lost his charm already?\nSean Connery George Lazenby Timothy Dalton\nBest Bond Film: On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service\nPlot: When Bond goes undercover as a\ngenealogist to a Swiss mountain resort\nhe discovers that Blofeld intends on using\nyoung women with sleep disorders to unleash a deadly virus on the world.\nWhy this is the best: Although this\nwas his only outing and therefore has to\nbe his best film, Lazenby delivers as both\na realistic and charming Bond, despite\nbeing panned by both fans and critics.\nThis film is much better than most Connery films and overall is one of the most\nmemorable and exciting Bond outings.\nHighlights include: Bond falling in\nlove with Tracy, Bond sleeping with everyone in the ski resort, the many Alpine\ncar chases, Bond being married and then\nwidowed (sniff).\nMemorable quote: Bond: \u201cHe had a\nlot of guts\u201d.\nBest Bond bit: Bond on skies being\nchased down a bobsled run by Blofeld.\nBest Bond Film: The Spy Who Loved\nMe\nPlot: AcrazymillionairenamedStromberg intends to create a nuclear war in order to destroy the world so that he can\nbegin a new civilisation under the sea.\nWhy this is the best: It was heartbreaking for me to decide which film\nto choose for Moore as almost all of his\nseven Bond outings are excellent. But this\none has everything a Bond film should:\ncar chases, sexy women, huge sets being\ndestroyed, a crazy villain, and of course,\nthe best Bond of all time, Roger Moore\nhimself.\nHighlights include: Beautiful Russian\nsecret agent Anya Amasova (aka Agent\nTriple X), Jaws: the best Bond villain\never, car chases and fights in and around\nEgypt, lots of destruction and explosions,\ntrap doors that lead to killer shark tanks,\nthe underwater car and a very good\ntheme song.\nMemorable quote: Bond: \u201cKeeping\nthe British end up, sir!\u201d\nBest Bond bit: When Bond leaps from\na mountain top and opens his parachute\nto reveal a Union Jack. Rule Britannia!\nBest Bond Film: License To Kill\nPlot: Afterhisbestfriendisalmostkilled\nby a South American drugs baron Bond\nresigns from the MI6 and goes rogue in\norder to exact revenge.\nWhy this is the best: This is Dalton\nbeing a \u2018serious\u2019 Bond and although this\ndoes not always work, the more adult plot\nand down-beat tone add an interesting element to the film, not often seen in Bond\nfilms. Plus Dalton\u2019s other effort, \u2018The Living Daylights\u2019, is pretty dry.\nHighlights include: Two very hot\nBond women, the shoot out in the bar,\nlots of grisly murders including a man\u2019s\nhead exploding and a man being churned\nup in a Cocaine machine, Q, as he has\na large supporting role and the tanker\ntruck car chase at the end.\nMemorable quote: Sharkey: \u201cGod,\nwhat a terrible waste.

It\nwas an excellent choice\nfor a Halloween night ball. Both a\nclassy and simple theme, which elegantly complimented the stylish frocks\nand tuxedos on display.\nThe festivities kicked off at 6.30pm\nwith scientists dining upstairs and\nengineers downstairs. The chocolate\ntorte and wine were firm favourites\nwith many. There was a curious lack of\nafter dinner speeches but \u2018The Boomalaka\u2019 tradition remained strong.\nPost-dinner entertainment kicked off\nwith a Jazz quartet providing a snappy\nsoundtrack to the students useless at-temptsattheroulettewheel. Somekind\nof prize for the chip leader would have\nbeen nice, to make the casino more\nthan just a drunken misadventure.\nDJs from the Music Tech society\nplayed all night. Keeping to mainstream cheese and dance hits, they\npleased the tastes of a varied crowd.\nSomewhat controversially, posters\nadvertising Colin Murray\u2019s DJ slot at\nthe Union were prominently displayed\nthroughout the Sherfield Building.\nMany ball ticket holders took advantage of free entry to the union. Colin\u2019s\nwell attended set of indie dancefloor\nclassics went down a storm.\nMy only qualm was the decor. Maybe\nit\u2019s just me but I felt more could have\nbeen done to hide the unglamorous\nreality of the Sherfield Building. Obviously such a transformation is near\nimpossible. I still felt that a better effort could have been made in terms of\nmore comprehensive music and mood\nlighting linking all areas of the ball.\nOverall it was a pleasant night with\nthe standard fare. It seemed as though\neveryone had a good time, and clearly\nthey aimed to please.\nH\now would you spend\n\u00a325,000 in one night?\nA champagne fountain?\nA unique performance\nby your favourite band?\nWould you rent out the entire Ritz Hotel for one night?

When his plane was shot\ndown over Hanoi whilst on a bombing raid the then young Maverick was\noffered an early bargaining deal to retrieve him from the prisoner of war\ncamp before those who have been in\nthere for longer, due to his father\u2019s status as a top Admiral in the US Navy.\nHis refusal was a testament to his belief\nin the notion of justice and sacrifice for\nhis fellow Americans and his inability\nto wave to the cameras and crowds\nduring the presidential race remains\nas a dark reminder of what his subsequent years in the Hanoi Hilton had\ndone to this man.\nBut the greatest testament of McCain\u2019s character had to be his concession speech, where he told a solemn and at times frustrated Arizona\ncrowd:\n\u201cMy friends we have got to the end\nof a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken\nclearly\u201d and \u201cI urge all Americans who\nsupported me to join me in not just\ncongratulating him but offering our\nnext president our good will and earnest effort to come together.\u201d\nYou could say what ever you like\nabout McCain and revel as much as\npossible on the historic election of a\n\u2018black president\u2019 but one cannot wonder if McCain ran as a candidate for\na party that was not associated with\na leader that has been so ignorant\nand bungling that he brought about\nthe term \u2018Bushism\u2019 whether his fate\nwould have been different on the 4th\nof November.\nFor even before his political career\nbegan and after his campaign for the\nhighest office in the US had ended,\nMcCain has done nothing but put his\ncountry first.\nA man who believes in America\nGilead Amit\nI\u00b4m writing this article today for various reasons, the first if not foremost, as\na reply to Imperial Girl\u00b4s article which\nhas triggered this. First of all I quite\nliked the article, she mentioned of how\nwe live in a superficial society and how\nguys at Imperial should attempt to see\nwomen for who they are rather than\nhow they look like, which leads me to\nthe problem I wish to address.\nImperial College, a University\nstrongly centered on scientific and\ntechnological subjects, however despite the massive union, the many\nparties and all the rest, there seems to\nbe a social problem. Casual meetings\nare frequent, but to truly get to know\nsomeone, or for a relationship to form,\nto bridge the gap between having met\nand knowing one another is all too\nrare. Talk tends to stay far away from\none\u00b4s own persona and at least in my\ncase more thoughts, jokes, ideas etc.\nare filtered out by some irrational inhibition than ever make their way out.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d one might think, and I can\nspeak but for my own experiences and\nfeelings on the matter and deduce from\nthat. Judging from myself, some people\nsimply think too much about the possible outcomes before acting or speaking until the scenario in which it could\nbe misinterpreted pops up and the idea\nis discarded. And there\u00b4s always a scenario like that.\nIntroversion, shyness, lack of cour-age, insecurity\u2026 name it how you will,\nit\u2019s a normal characteristic most often\nfound within academics of\u2026 yes you\nguessed it scientific, technological and\nmathematical subjects. Usually this is\nnot too much of a problem since in\nother environments the large portion\nof more outgoing people tends to pull\nthe rest in, but when we are dealing\nwith Imperial, often whoever you are\ntalking with feels equally uncomfortable to change the subject at hand or\npropose an idea.\nSo is it that people are excessively\nsuperficial (Note that quite obviously\nlooks will always be a criteria, albeit\nthat they shouldn\u2019t be the only one. Few\nwould wish to enter a relationship with\nsomeone that is aesthetically repelling\nto them regardless of their personality)\nor is it the aversion to discussing more\npersonal matters that is the problem?\nHow many people are there that know\n\u201cwho you are?\u201d. How many people have\nyou given a realistic chance of truly\ngetting to know you without expecting\nthem to make a step you can\u00b4t seem to\ndo yourself?\nPhysical attractiveness is a quality that can be noticed immediately\u2026\nwhile personality is more often than\nnot hidden and often very hard to determine and find out about. My guess\nto the main reason why you never felt\nthe same for an imperial student was\nsimply because you as well as him\nopened up more easily through the in-ternet, regardless what you look like.\nI can at least say of myself that the\nnumber of things left unsaid, the\nnumber of ideas left unmentioned, the\nnumber of possibilities left unexplored\nand of chances missed is staggering\nand with time it can become frustrat-ing. Yet really the only one to be able to\ndo anything about that is one self, as a\nwise man once told me.\nSo as I reach the end of my article on\nhow people limit themselves, hoping\nfor others to break out of their shell to\ntake an action they can\u00b4t do themselves\nI am faced with a daunting choice\nwhich I knew I would have to face.\nAm I to truly send this in, or will\nit be another train of thoughts left\nunmentioned?\nWill I hide behind a anonymous writers name or will I sign it with my name,\nregardless of what people\u2019s opinions\nmight turn out like?\nWikipedia, wikipedia: oh, how we need ya\nTick fucking tock bloody tick\nImperial Girl\nI can\u2019t understand where on earth the\ntime goes. It feels like we just finished\nfreshers\u2019 week but now we are already\nmore than half way through the first\nterm and let\u2019s be honest, the only terms\nthat are worth talking about are this\none and spring term. Summer term is\nnot a term, it isn\u2019t even a time, it\u2019s just\na long blur of red/blue bolt smells from\nthe person who decided that sleeping\nin the library will save those precious\nmoments that will allow them to get\nthe ultimate grade. Please, go the hell\nhome and brush your hair!\nBack to where I was, time seems to\nbe slipping away. I am finding it harder\nto get up in the mornings to the point\nwhere I am sleeping straight through\nthe alarm (and that\u2019s really hard with\nmy alarm). In the first week it was all\nbushy tail, red cheeks and ready to go.\nNow it\u2019s just \u2018if I wash when I get back\nI can sleep for another 10 minutes\u2019 or\n\u2018if I plan what I am going to wear in\nmy head whilst I rest my eyes for a few\nmore minutes in bed, I\u2019ll be super efficient when I get up and hence SAVE\ntime. Genius!\u2019\nWhy I am I trying to scrimp and\nsave every minute I have? What am I\ndoing that is making me so busy? I am\nsat here now trying to figure out where\nall the time went. So there are those\npointless lectures that I never listen or\nlearn anything in. That takes a good\nportion of the day. Or maybe the endless time I spend pretending to study\nwhilst on Facebook. The time it takes\nto walk to college. The time it takes to\neat. The time it takes to... I think you\nget my point. Everything happens so\nfast that I often forget to enjoy myself.\nNo, it\u2019s not that as I have come to re-alise, it\u2019s that we do things so fast that\nwe forget to realise how much fun we\nhave doing it. Please excuse the potential innuendo.\nSo talking to a friend of mine recent-ly, I decided that perhaps we should set\naside a certain amount of time each\nweek to do something that we really\nenjoy and whilst we are engaging in\nthat activity, we acknowledge that we\nare doing something not for anyone\nelse but for our pure self indulgence.\nOn another subject, I heard through\nthe grapevine that a right imbecile de-cidedtoleteveryoneknowhowshallow\nhe was in his Entrepreneurship class\nby saying; \u201cobviously a guy knows what\nhe likes about a girl- long legs, blonde\nhair and big boobs\u201d. Listen mate, stop\ndrooling over those pictures pinned in\nthe red phone box down Gloucester\nRoad and get a real girl that responds\nwhen you harass her. But I forgive you\nfor your sin this once; you hadn\u2019t yet\nread my column from last week.\nAmin Elmubarak\nAccept your suffering; joy will follow\nCaz Knight\nSuffering: our conditioning has moulded us into beings who strive to avoid\nthis and any other forms of awkwardness which could induce discomfort.\nOur inherent nature to seek pleasure,\ncomfort and ease above all other forms\nof feeling and emotion is part of our biological instinct to survive. Our minds\nhave learned to associate beneficial actions with pleasure: eating, drinking,\ncoitus. And those which jeopardise the\nsurvival that will in turn lead us to live\nlong enough to generate progeny are\nassociated with fear, the will to flea and\npain. It is amazing how our brains, in\nconjunction with our bodies, will go\nto any length to ensure our morale is\nkept high enough to ensure we have\nthe will to live, because reproduction is\nchallenging once one\u2019s pulse stops. The\nhuman race has undergone a gradual\nelevation from Paleolithic cave dwellers to where we stand now, the implicit\nmeaning being that we have things to\nlive for other than procreating and\nsimply being.\nNow that some of us have evolved\nslightly let us reconsider this \u2018ugly\u2019 notion of suffering and pain. According\nto Schopenhauer, pleasure only exists once suffering ends, implying that\npleasure is nothing in its own right.\nHis rival Nietzsche insisted that joy\nwas much more potent than any pain,\nyet the two were still very much entan-gled- one not being able to exist without the other. And so we have our first\nargument for suffering: we enjoy our\ntimes of happiness all the more after\nbattling adversity to get to them. The\npain makes the two states distinct and\nnot the other way round. If it was joy\nthat defined pain, it would imply it was\npain we strived for and as humans we\nknow that this is not the case, no matter how necessary suffering is.\nNietzsche\u2019s definition of greatness\nwas the ability to endure suffering ef-fortlessly, not a small favour in the\nslightest. His ubermensch (the ultimate form of evolved man) would be\nable to do this as well as accepting\nman\u2019s suffering and to not let the fact\nthat man will always suffer upset them.\nAgain, this is asking a lot of a civilisation whose gut instinct is to try and\neliminate suffering and bring comfort\nto the lives of its people. What other\nreason for council housing and aid to\nAfrica? Pity is commonly regarded as\nsomething virtuous and that we are\nbetter people for wanting to alleviate\nsomeone else\u2019s discomfort. However,\npeople do not often stop to think that\nperhaps these people need their suf-fering. Those reading this will be up\nat arms at my callousness for implying\nthose African orphans require their\nstarvation. If one believes in reincarnation and karma, then yes, those children were obviously hideous people\nin their previous life and got what was\ncoming to them.\nI believe the first step is to accept\nsuffering as a vital part of existence\nand required as part of a balanced life-style, the emphasis being on balance\nbetween joy and pain. I am not advocating perpetual unease! It is so much\nhealthier to let yourself experience the\nwhole spectrum of human emotion\nand not to try to quell or be ashamed of\nany negative emotion we go through. I\nfeel immense pressure from society to\nalways appear in control, happy, strong\nand resilient whereas it is perfectly acceptable to feel anxiety.\nOur conditioning has also programmed us to like things that are\ngood and bring pleasure and to dislike\nthings which cause us pain. The idea of\nliking something that is painful seems\nparadoxical but it is not; the painful\nthing is the cause/stimulus whereas the\npleasure we get from it is the effect. A\ngood example of this would be BDSM\n(bondage-discipline sadomasochism).\nThe pain undergone from physical\nharm (and sometimes from mental\nstress caused by mind games) causes\nthe body to release its pain killing\nendorphins which will in turn bring\nabout a high. The searing pain I felt as\nI thudded to the ground trying to cross\nthe road was extraordinary and at first\nI felt the rising of anger and frustra-tion. The pain kept on but I let myself\nenjoy it as I hobbled along, imagining\nthe bruise that would come.\nGoing for that run may be utterly\nexhausting but we are treated to our\nbody\u2019s natural drugs afterwards, not\nto mention the satisfaction of shedding a few pounds and increasing our\nphysical fitness. How much better that\nchocolate cake tastes after a stint of\nmoderation and how much more potent that first alcoholic drink is when\nwe have battled through a week of abstinence also demonstrates that suffering (in this case denying ourselves)\nmakes us appreciate joy all the more. It\nis worth noting that the anticipation of\nsomething is nearly always many times\nworse than the thing itself: our brains\nare trying to fool us so that we avoid\nthat situation. Conversely, a similar\nphenomenon is true of pleasure; in\nmany cases the further in time we get\nfrom an occurrence the more pleasant\nthe memory of that event becomes:\nnostalgia. I digress.\nBy experiencing pain we also learn a\ngreat deal and come out stronger. I can\nguarantee that the benefit from every\nsituation, no matter how horrific, will\nbecome obvious a while after. \u2018Every\ncloud has a silver lining\u2019 illustrates\nthis.\nArt is fuelled by pain too. Intense\nand original art pours forth when the\nartist is going through a difficult time.\nI find I can only produce what I think\nare effective poems when I am very\nangry, bitter or upset. I gain no inspiration from feelings of mirth or love.\nThat is not to say every artist is this\nway and thank god or all our galleries\nwould be rife with angst. Art requires\nsuffering at the same time as our suffering requires art to help us through\ntough times. Tragedy was a way for the\nGreeks to make themselves feel better\nabout how odious and disgusting the\nworld was. In this day and age we have\nHeat magazine (although not strictly\nart!).\nThe morale of the column is to accept your suffering and know joy is to\nfollow.\nW\ne humans are\nstrange in many\nways. Only the other day, for instance,\nI was watching tel-evision. Crazy, eh?\nAll our strangeness, however, can be\ntraced back to our willingness to forego practicality for spiritual or physical\nenjoyment. We are the most superstitious and ritualistic of beings, deriving\npleasure from common fears, goals and\nexperiences. We have invented weird\nand wonderful things to do with food\nwhere the final energy intake in no way\njustifies the effort expended. We have\nconverted the simple ingestion of nutrients into a social exercise and the act\nof procreation into a recreational and\nromantic one. We spend valuable time\nexpressing our emotions and admiring\nthose who can do it with more honesty\nor skill than ourselves.\nAnd while some of these attributes\nmay be shared by various animals, no\nother creature lives for enjoyment the\nway we do. Survival \u2013 the simple struggle to carry on living \u2013 is no longer\na challenge for us. We\u2019ve moved on\nto level 2. We\u2019re so good at the game\nthat we have to invent challenges for\nourselves just to make it worth play-ing. We form pointless, wasteful, tire-some, irritating and entirely wonderful\nemotional attachments to people and\nto things. We are the most rational of\nanimals and yet simultaneously the\nonly creatures who can afford to live\nfor non-practical goals. This is the dichotomy that sums us up.\nTake Kindle \u2013 Amazon\u2019s new \u00a3360\nwireless reading device, for instance.\nThere\u2019s no getting around the fact that\nit\u2019s a wonderful invention. And I could\nprobably cajole a relative into buying it\nfor me for my generic-non-faith-spe-cific winterval holiday later this year.\nStaggeringly innovative as it is, though,\nI don\u2019t want one. In this, as in so much\nelse, I am precisely that pipe-smoking\ncolonial major with a roaring fire in\nhis darkened, oak-panelled study who,\nwith a red velvet smoking hat on his\nwhitened hair and a snifter of brandy\nin his hand, loudly and imperiously\ndamns those newfangled technowhat-sits. I am now channelling the worst of\nhidebound, anachronistic, misplaced\nnostalgia. But I\u2019m doing it to make sure\nnone of you feels a need to.\nSo here I sit, militarized, musta-chioed and monocled, adamantly saying that I will never give up my books\nfor an electronic reader.\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t recognize and\nappreciate its stunning practicality.\nI\u2019m sure such a machine will be more\nportable, convenient and easier to read\nthan my paperback or hardbound cop-ies. It\u2019s just not a question of logic or\nof weighing up pros and cons. I am\na weak, fickle, emotion-driven human being, and I make weak, fickle,\nemotion-driven, human decisions.\nYoung as I am, I have already spent\nenough time floating around libraries\nand second-hand bookstores to know\nI\u2019ll never be able to break that emotional attachment. In the same way my\ngrandfather point blank refuses to see\nthe advantages of high-speed inter-net, word processing software or, you\nknow, a keyboard, I equally stubbornly\ncling to my precious collection of yellowing paper, cardboard and leather.\nUntil you can get a piece of gadgetry\nto smell of old glue, crack loudly when\nyou open it for the first time, have dust\naccumulate on its spine or deteriorate\nin that delightful, inevitable way that\nbooks do, I will remain proud and colonial in my study. At least it has books\nlining the walls.\nIt occurs to me that we are the last\ngeneration who will be able to remember a time when ignorance was accept-able. To channel Donald Rumsfeld, that\nsublime footnote to history, \u2018there will\nbe a time when we will look back and\nremember a time when we could still\nremember things we\u2019d forgotten\u2019. In\nnormalspeak, we will be able to recall\nthe last days when the World Book of\nKnowledge had any relevance. When\nthe Encyclopaedia Britannica was the\nfirst port of call for those seeking random trivia. Those 30 beautiful blue\nvolumes that contained within them\nthe store of all information anyone\nneeded to know before 2001.\nAnd then, suddenly, along came\nJimmy Wales. And wikipedia made an\nentrance into our lives. Now, true, it\u2019s\nwonderful to be able to find out the\nintricacies of the Namamuga incident,\nwhere a British merchant was killed\nfor refusing to show subservience to a\nJapanese daimyo; to discover the exact\nnature of the foreign policy relationship Palau has with the United States;\nthe names given to various nought-to-infinity integrals; or the list of Rwandan presidents at the click of a button.\nBut taking a heavy, cobalt-blue tome\noff the shelf and leafing through it, before discovering that you\u2019d taken the\nwrong volume and in fact needed the\nindex and a kindly adult to explain the\ndifference between micropaedia and\nmacropaedia and interpret the unusual\ncross-referencing notation used by the\nBritannica editors had a great deal of\nromance associated with it.\nBefore wikipedia, seeking information was something almost glamor-ous. An elitist adventure. Now it has\nbecome a populist commercialized\npilgrimage. The spirit of the \u201849 gold\nrush has gradually morphed into the\nmotivation behind a family trip to\nDisneyland.\nIt takes time to get used to. I don\u2019t\nknow about you, but I liked getting\nmy information from a world-renon-wed expert on a subject, printed on\nalmost transparently thin sheets of\npaper with a gold border, rather than\nhaving it instantaneously revealed to\nme in leetspeak by some spotty teenager in Minnesota with the handle\nOptimus413lolz.\nBut \u2013 and there is no possible way\nI can emphasize that But to the proportions it deserves \u2013 this is the spirit\nthat flooded out of the printing presses\nat Mainz in 1452. These are the ideals that prompted Luther to nail his\n95 theses to the church door in Wittemberg in 1546. Knowledge belongs\nto the people, and the most romantic\nthing about it is being able to spread it\nto the world. Books were nice, vellum\nmust have been remarkable, papyri and\nstone tablets were probably infinitely\nmore attractive. We move on, and we\ngradually lose our reliance on the technologies of preceding generations. The\nonly thing stopping us is sentimentality and emotion. Try as we like to to get\nrid of these irritatingly fluffy aspects of\nour characters, they won\u2019t go away. All\nwe can do is hope our children have as\nlittle patience for our nostalgia as we\nhave for that of our parents. And believe me, they will.\nToday, anyone can access whatever\ninformation they want to, whenever\nthey want to, in the easiest possible\nway. That is amazing in itself, but it\nneeds the new 21st Century mindset\nto appreciate. And I love it \u2013 of course\nI do \u2013 but you can\u2019t expect a cantankerous ex-Army empire-builder to be\ndragged into the 21st Century without\na good deal of kicking and screaming.\nNot when there\u2019s half a pint of brandy\ninside him.\n\n"

What\nfollowed though was one of the most\nmusically mind-expanding TV watching experiences I have ever had.\nThe documentary itself was somewhat mediocre \u2013 an endless parade\nof the friends of Young scrambling to\nconvince the audience how important they were in his musical develop-ment, and Young himself managing\nperhaps half a dozen interesting comments in between long bouts of being a narcissistic prick, but it was the\nmusical soundtrack that made this into\nsomething excellent. Obviously it was\nalmost entirely Neil Young composi-tions, each song played to illustrate\nthe music being made in each era, but\nuntil then I had written him off as a bit\nof a one-trick pony, rising out of the\noften predictable burble of \u2018popular\nrock legends\u2019 to create Harvest, only\nto fall quickly back down again into\nthe homogenous mass of Rock Hall\nof Fame inductees. For this opinion, I\ncould not eat any more of the humble\npie than I did during the course of the\ndocumentary.\nBeginning with tunes by his first\nband \u2018the Squires\u2019 at age 16, the music\nprogressed through compositions during his stints with (fellow Rock Hall of\nFamers) Buffalo Springfield, through\nto Crosby Stills Nash and Young, and\nfinally to his successes as a solo artist\nup to the present day, and I don\u2019t think\nthere was a dud among them. His music is honest, creative, and without a\nhint of pretention.\nIt kind of got me thinking though -when I first started watching it, I was\nalmost expecting uninteresting, samey\ntunes about girlfriends and skateboard-ing, so cynical have I become by the\nstate of popular rock music in modern musical times. There is something\nthat rock from the 60s and 70s has that\nseems to have got glossed out in our\nage of technocratic overproduction.\nWhat that something is is somewhat up for debate. The easy answer\nwould be originality, although I don\u2019t\nthink this is too accurate \u2013 no-one has\ndone exactly what Coldplay or Keane\nor whoever are doing before, but that\ndoesn\u2019t stop it from leaving an un-satisfying, hollow taste in the ears. I\nthink the more worrying deficit is in\nits honesty \u2013 some of these bands almost sound like their music was written in response extensive focus group\nresearch. It begs the question though:\nhow is anyone supposed to relate to\nmusic created to pander towards large\naudiences, rather than challenge and\nstimulate them? How long can this\nindustrialised mass-consumption continue when it\u2019s devoid of any emotional\nstimulus? Answers on a postcard.\nThe Domino State opened the show\nwith an unsatisfying performance that\nwas too easily ignored and forgotten.\nAs an odd choice of support they failed\nto connect well with the crowd, only\nmanaging to raise a slight nod here and\nthere. The generic feel of their set was\npunctuated by a few hints of interesting and unique sounds, but these were\ndiscarded before they gained any mo-mentum, leaving the songs fairly direc-tionless and making The Domino State\na frustrating live act.\nThe main man behind M83, Anthony Gonzalez, came on stage surrounded by his three tour companions\nwho\u2019s help he had enlisted in performing his creations live. Taking his position amongst laptops, keyboards and\nbizarre looking electronics, his album\nvocalist Morgan Kibby stood opposite\nhim ready to provide extra keyboards,\nLoic Maurin brought the drums and\nPierre-Marie Maulini had the bass and\nguitar covered.\nExpectant ears and eager eyes were\nupon the French man as M83 opened\ntheir set with \u2018Run Into Flowers\u2019 from\n\u2018Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts\u2019.\nThe fast pace of the keyboards and\nsampled sounds built with echoing\nvocals, creating a mesmerizing and\nspine chilling performance that set the\nstandard high for the rest of the show.\nAnthony has a way of crafting incredibly epic and amazing songs which\nwork beautifully in the context of an\nalbum but, as they proved, are equally\nJames Houghton\nC\u2019est Chaussure Regarder\nShine your shoes, we\u2019ve got some gazing to do. Jorga Costa spoke with M83 frontman\nAnthony Gonzalez, and James Houghton all\u00e9 down to Scala for their London show\nM83\nScala\n22nd October, 2008\nDamn mobiles! If they weren\u2019t so useful\nto my social life, for listening to music\nand playing games and accessing the\ninternet on the go and waking me up\nin the mornings and stuff, I probably\nwould have chucked mine out of the\nwindow years ago. Anthony Gonzalez,\nfront man of French electronic shoe-gazers, M83, took few minutes out of\na busy UK tour to talk about live shows\nand their latest album, \u2018Saturdays =\nYouth\u2019, but technology had other ideas\nand it wasn\u2019t until we were cut off once\nthat the interview started\u2026\nLooking at your touring schedule,\nyou\u2019re playing in Manchester\ntonight?\nYes, yes we are playing tonight in Manchester. That would be the first time!\nAny Madonna-like pre-concert\nrituals before you guys take the\nstage?\n[laughs] No rituals. We like to have a\ngood meal and go to a good restaurant.\nWe like to have sushi before we go on\nstage and yeah, drink a bit of alcohol!\nCongratulations on your Scala\ngig! I went with a friend who\u2019s\nreviewing the gig and we were\nboth curious as to why your\ndrummer is in a box?!\nBecause I think it looks good on stage \u2013\nI like it! But no, it\u2019s also because otherwise there is too much sound because\nthose drums can be very loud. So it\u2019s\njust a question of sound level.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite song to\nplay live?\n[Thinks for a bit] I don\u2019t know, I like to\nplay \u2018Don\u2019t Save Us From The Flames\u2019\nbecause a lot of people are expecting\nthat song during the live show. And I\nlike \u2018Couleurs\u2019 on the new album.\nIs there one song that you\u2019ll\nnever play live, or do you give\neverything a chance?\nWe never really play songs from the\nprevious albums because it is always\ndifficult to reproduce the sound of the\nalbum live, you know? And it\u2019s quite\ndifficult to play some of the songs from\nthose previous albums. For example,\nwe never play the last song from our\nlast album, \u2018Lower Your Eyelids To Die\nWith The Sun\u2019, because it\u2019s very long\nand very produced so it\u2019s almost impossible to play.\nWhat made you want to make an\nalbum about your teenage years?\nJust one minute! [at this point, something clicks and whirrs in the back-ground]. I mean, yeah, I\u2019ve always\nbeen fascinated by teenagers and also\nbecause I was really happy as a teenager and it was some of the best days of\nmy life so far. So this album is kind of a\ntribute to that.\nWhat kind of music were you\nAnthony Gonzalez looking moody and brooding. What a dreamboat. What I\u2019d give to be that microphone\nlistening to then and how has\nit influenced the music you\u2019re\nmaking?\nOh, mostly rock music like and the\nNew York scene and also a lot of German music from the seventies. Because of the German music, I started\nto buy keyboards and synthesizers and\nI started to play electronic music. And\nbecause of bands like Mogwai who\nhave a lot of guitar, I satarted to learn\nthe guitar and play rock music as well.\nI think that my music \u2018looks\u2019 like my\ninfluences, just a mix of the music I\nlove, a combination of everything I like\nin music.\nGerman music? So like Kraftwerk,\nperhaps?\nNot Kraftwerk in particular. More like\nPopol Vuh and Tangerine Dream and\nthese kinds of bands.\nSo what kind of music are you\nlistening to now?\nI\u2019m listening to a lot of classical music\nand popular music. I\u2019m listening to a\nlot of albums this year; I think it has\nbeen a good year for music. I really like\nthe Fleet Foxes album!\nWhy the 80\u2019s? A lot of people are\ngoing back to that era in terms of\nfashion, films and music. Why do\nyou think that is?\nI don\u2019t know, I think 80\u2019s music is certainly one of the most important for\nthe music industry and for music his-tory. It\u2019s definitely one of the most interesting periods. A lot of bands from\nthe 80s, they have invented something,\nlike a sound that really created something new. I really like the sound production on the albums from the 80s. I\nthink it sounds always amazing \u2013 it\u2019s\nreally different from the 70s. There\u2019s\nthis really big gap for me between the\n70s and the 80s.\nIt\u2019s been over six months since\nS=Y came out. Are you happy\nwith the reception?\nM83, located in the Centaurus group\n\u201cWe like to have\nsushi before we\ngo out on stage\u201d\nYeah! It\u2019s been a while since the previous album and it\u2019s really encouraging\nfor the future. I\u2019m really excited to tour\nfor this album and it\u2019s been very positive overall!\nWould you do anything\ndifferently?\nIt\u2019s very difficult to create and compose\nan album \u2013 the most difficult thing for\nan artist! I spent so much time on it and\nso much energy, but I think it\u2019s a good\nalbum for now and I just can\u2019t wait to\nwork on another one.\nProbably a scary question, but\nyou\u2019ve hinted at it earlier on: any\nideas for the next album?\nIt\u2019s too early to say, because my head\nis so focused on the tour right now \u2013\nwe\u2019re touring until the end of the year\nand at the end it\u2019s going to be very difficult for me to work on anything new.\nBut I have some ideas in my head.\nCan we expect an album based\non 90s youth, maybe?\n[laughs] Yeah, maybe! But it would be\nfor sure different.\nAnd then, just as the conversation\nveered towards their up-coming tour\nsupporting Kings of Leon, the line\ndrops. So we\u2019ll never, ever hear if he\nhas any words of wisdom for the current youth, or whether, as his latest album title indicates, Saturday is still the\nbest day of the week. Perhaps we can\nanswer that last one for ourselves.\nM83\u2019s latest album, \u2018Saturdays =\nYouth\u2019 is out now and they will tour\nwith Kings of Leon around the UK in\nDecember.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always\nbeen fascinated\nby teenagers\u201d\nJorge Costa\nas impressive as a live performance.\nNeglecting earlier work off the\nself titled album, the set is filled predominantly with songs from \u2018Before\nthe Dawn Heals Us\u2019 and \u2018Saturdays =\nYouth\u2019. Despite the differences between\nthese two albums the set manages to\nfit together well keeping the crowd\nenthralled throughout. \u2018A Guitar And\nA Heart\u2019 and \u2018Moon Child\u2019 showed off\nthe band\u2019s more shoegazing-electroni-ca moments while synth-heavy pop\nsongs \u2018Graveyard Girl\u2019 and \u2018Kim and\nJessie\u2019 receive the greatest response\nfrom the crowd.\nAnthony\u2019s softly whispered vocals\ncontrast skillfully with the throbbing\nkeyboards on \u2018We Own The Sky\u2019. It\nwould have been an obvious choice to\nend with \u2018Lower Your Eyelids To Die\nWith The Sun\u2019, one of the most perfect\nalbum closing songs which was sadly\nmissing from their set, but instead the\nencore brings \u2018Couleurs\u2019.\nM83 easily filled the Scala, the venue\u2019s size creating an intimate feel without cramping their atmospheric sound.\nIt will be interesting to see if they manage to stay so engaging and exciting\nwhen they perform in the O2 Arena\nand Wembely Stadium where they are\nsupporting tedious indie pretty-boys\nKings of Leon this December.\n\u201csoftly\nwhispered vocals\ncontrasted\nwith throbbing\nkeyboards\u201d\nSome guy from some band plays some instrument\nThree unrelated single reviews\nDuncan Casey\nDark Horse\nFlat Screen Suicide\nHHIII\nThe introductory EP from Darke\nHorse is a mixed bag \u2013 there\u2019s clearly\na lot of talent there, with a front-man\nyou can almost see jumping around\non-stage despite the studio production\nand an axe-man who\u2019s clearly knows\nhis way round his six strings and isn\u2019t\nafraid to rip out a solo on demand.\nOn the down-side, the songwriting\nWith a name like this, I was expecting\na proper rude-boy two step track, but\nthe combination of soulful vocals, laid\nback brass and electro backing actually creates a sound that belongs firmly\nalongside that Fun Lovin\u2019 Criminals\nCDs you play when you get home after\na late night out. It\u2019s cool without being\nself-conscious, and as a result sounds\nlike they\u2019ve had a lot of fun making it.\nOn the flip side, that\u2019s not always\nDuncan Casey\nFat Freddy\u2019s Drop\nPull The Catch\nHHHHI\nRuby Blevings\nFriendly Fires\nParis\nHHIII\nNME et al drawing the usual parallels between fellow St Albaners Enter\nShikari and linking them with \u2018new\nrave\u2018 clearly hasn\u2019t bothered Friendly\nFires much, as they have retained the\ncowbells and synths from the original\nrelease of \u2018Paris\u2019 last year. In addition,\nthis time round they\u2019ve added some\nbeefed up production which, combined\nwith some girly backing vocals courtesy of Au Revoir Simone, make this\nessentially a mass pleasing pop song.\nOK they might have lost their edge a\nbit, but who can blame them - it\u2019s done\nwonders for their airplay. They were\non Jools Holland don\u2019t you know...\nis what you might describe as \u2018a work\nin progress\u2019. The EP title track\u2019s verse\nriffs are shamelessly lifted from EMF\u2019s\n\u2018Unbelievable\u2019, which is a pity considering that bouncing around to the chorus would otherwise be quite good\nfun \u2013 although that might be because\nit doesn\u2019t have any of the largely banal\nlyrics scattered throughout the rest of\nthe song. The second rack suffers simi-larly: although the chorus is quite cool\n\u2013 \u2018Jack\u2019s My Friend\u2019 referring to boozing your way out of a crisis \u2013 the rest\nof the lyrics are simply awful, and the\nFranz Ferdinand feel across the rest of\nthe track doesn\u2019t help much either.\nThe third song\u2019s a bit more fun,\nthough \u2013 \u2018Reinvent Your Accent\u2019 is a\ntirade against the Arctic Monkeys that\nthey haven\u2019t even pretended to dis-guise, and the result is a much sharper\ntrack, with a hint of real bitterness.\nUnfortunately, the three-chord guitar\nriff makes them sound like a poor Status Quo cover band, which probably\nwasn\u2019t the desired effect. This band\ncould be one to watch over the next\nyear or so, but at the moment they still\nsound like a band playing covers so\nthere\u2019s a fair bit of polishing going to\nbe required before they break the big-time.\nFat Freddy\u2019s drop - just sort of hangin\u2019 out, you know?\nto be encouraged: the job\u2019s to make a\ngood record, not to spend five minutes\nof your life making noodly sounds with\nunusual equipment whilst gazing at\nyour navel, a la recent Radiohead. This\nsuffers from similar problems in patches \u2013 although the electronic kit delivers\na pretty phat bass-line, the 80s synth\nray-gun noises make you wonder what\nthe band were doing when the rest of\nus realised they were naff some twenty\nyears ago (those of you who were born\ntwenty years ago, anyway). Overall, though, the track\u2019s a well-crafted\ncome-down number, best enjoyed on\na beach at sunset. Or failing that, try\nit on your balcony with a crafty joint\nwhen you get in from the pub.\n\u201cthe job is to make\ngood music, not to\nspend five minutes\nof your life making\nnoodly sounds\nwith unusual\nequiptment whist\ngazing at your\nnavel\u201d\nWhat a fucking poncy fucking cunt. Get a real job you fucking shitters\n\n"

This leaves a very basic choice:\nto have cheese, to have bacon or to go\nau naturel.\nSome fans of modern franchise cooking may declare this a violation of their\nright to choice, but fuck them. Just\nout of respect for God\u2019s creatures you\nshould want to taste the beast who had\nits throat slit to make you fat. Mango\nchutney doesn\u2019t feel pain.\nMoving on from such frivolity, I can\ninform you that from the moment the\nburger touches your lips, you know that\nthis is a product of quality. Once again,\nthe key to Byron is the simplicity and\nthe painstaking pursuit of perfection.\nThe beef, naturally Aberdeen Angus,\nis sourced from farmers in Morayshire,\nScotland. It is served with basic salad\nin the classic soft white bun, made by a\nfourth-generation East End baker. In\nwhat could well be a wry homage to a\nL\nast week I mourned the\ndeath of Basil, my pet basil\nand the continued demise\nof Tim the Mint. Tim has\nalways been of a sickly constitution but, as is the norm for mint\nplants, he got too greedy and started\ngrowing roots beyond his capacity. He\nhas been moulting leaves for weeks\nand he will not be with us much longer.\nWith Basil the Basil it was a sudden\ndeath - no-one expected it. His leaves\nwere long and green with a full aroma,\nbut one frosty night last week he just\nwithered and died. Out of my 3 herbs\nonly Clive the Chive survives. The\nhardy herb is withstanding all frosts\nand even my scissor-happy hand as I\nuse him to season salads and fish left,\nright and centre! Bless him, he\u2019s even\nflowered!\nIt\u2019s Friday and we have come to the\nend of Healthy Living Week at Imperial College. I am writing this on Monday so I hope it has not passed in a\nwhisper and that some of you got involved in the free massages or come-and-try-it sports. Particularly, I hope\nyou all managed to scrounge healthy\nfree food on Queen\u2019s Lawn on Tuesday\nor Thursday!\nYou will do a double take when you\nread \u2018low fat\u2019 and \u2018Korma\u2019 in the same\nsentence but somehow I have managed the impossible in this week\u2019s food\npage. Instead of using a curry paste\nwhich has been wallowing in oil all its\nlife the flavours are infused by boiling\na water-based paste. It\u2019s all the rage,\ndaaaaarling. Please give it a go and let\nme know what you think. For dessert\nNatalia Jardon offers up a delish Lime\nCheesecake \u2013 it\u2019s the easiest thing in\nthe world and very decadent too.\nAlso, a little off the \u2018Healthy Living\u2019\ntopic, James Copley reviews the new\nbranch of Byron on Gloucester Road.\nByron\u2019s slogan is \u2018Proper Hamburgers\u2019 which basically means they have\n100% Aberdeen Angus steak in their\nburgers: no hooves, eyes or poo. Byron pride themselves on being simple\nwith no fuss or frills. I don\u2019t know what\nyour opinion is of the GBKs and Union\nHamburgers of this world but with all\nthe multiple wanky toppings you forget there\u2019s a burger in your burger. The\nnew Gloucester Road branch of Byron\nshould keep the local North American\ntourist population happy and I hope,\nreader, you will also partake in the delights of a proper hamburger.\nIf paying \u00a36 for a quality burger is\nnot your bag, baby, why not make your\nown? Mix together a pack of mince,\nhalf a grated onion, one slice of bread\n(grated to make crumbs), an egg and\nplenty of salt and pepper. Shape the\nmixture into patties , then grill or fry\nfor 5 minutes on each side. Serve the\nburgers in buns with whatever else you\nfancy.\nAs per usual, boys and girls, send in\nyour recipes, reviews and rants. I am\nnot one to threaten, but if you don\u2019t\nsend them in I will mix you with egg,\nbreadcrumbs and onion then fry YOU\non 5 minutes each side. You have been\nwarned. Love from Rosie xx\nrather more well-known burger chain,\na gherkin is placed on the side of the\nplate, thus avoiding a restaurant full of\npeople awkwardly attempting to prize\nit from the bun.\nThe thing that must to be questioned\nabout the restaurant is not the quality\nof the food, but the value for money.\n\u00a36-8 may seem steep, considering sides\nsuch as fries, chips or salads have to be\npurchased separately.\nFor some reason, no doubt to do with\nprofit, this has become standard in\nsuch establishments, yet who honestly\nwants to sit down and eat a beefburger\nwith no additional carbohydrate-based\naccompaniment?\nHowever, when you consider the cost\nof generic fast food in London today,\nByron\u2019s prices do seem fairly reason-able. Their direct competitors charge\nslightly more and offer a vastly inferior\nproduct.\nIn a city where every pub serves\nfood, and believes food to be a \u00a310\nbreadcrumb-and-gristle burger hidden\nbeneath a pile of sweet potato chips\nand drizzled with balsamic vinegar,\nByron surprises by offering something\naltogether more honest.\nAll in all, this is a welcome new addition to the armoury of the hungry but\nlazy, Imperial student.\nBoth cheaper and superior to Black\nand Blue just down the road, but lacking the cosy atmosphere of the previously reviewed Caffe Forum, Byron is\nwell worth a go. Just try and swallow\nany qualms you may have about eating\nin a burger joint named after a bisexual\nromantic poet.\nYou don\u2019t need to try and be macho:\nyou\u2019re eating cow for God\u2019s sake.\nIn honour of Healthy Living Week, this version of the artery-blocking popular dish is full of protein, low in\nfat and really, really tasty! Don\u2019t be put off by the list of ingredients: once you buy them, they last ages as\ninvaluable store cupboard ingredients. For example, bash cardamom pods up and infuse them with melted\nchocolate and milk to make a luxurious hot chocolate.

This is your\n\u2018curry paste\u2019. Take a nice big pan and simmer the curry paste for 5 minutes. Add the chicken to the paste and\nstir well making sure the meat is covered. Cook for 5 minutes, and then add the cinnamon, cardamom, sea-soning, lemon juice and coconut milk powder. Stir continuously on a medium heat for 10 minutes then add\nthe yoghurt with 150mL water. Simmer the curry for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve with rice and any\nother accompaniments you fancy.

Press this into\nthe base of an 18cm/7\u201d spring\nsided or loose bottomed cake\ntin. Chill in the refrigerator for 30\nminutes.

    "content": "felix sport Send in your sport reports:\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHigh resolution photos only\nJack Cornish &\nMustapher Botchway\nSports Editors\nSo it is nearly time to start ranking the\nteams against each other, but we will\nwait and keep you on tenterhooks for\na few more weeks.\nYou may see a reverse from last year\nhowever with recently promoted teams\nstruggling and those that have dropped\ndown a league storming through. This\nraises the question, can we sustain our\nposition as 22nd best sporting university in the country, with promoted\nteams taking a battering week in week\nout? Is there enough investment and\nsupport to keep us there? Alternatively is it solely due to the fact we are a\ngeek\u2019s university, and the geek population usually struggle in those cold,\nwet PE lessons with the power hungry\nteacher. This is not only a rant, but an\ninformed rant. The reason we pose\nsuch questions is because from speaking to captains from teams playing in\nBUCS, the opinion gathered is that\nother universities, with not necessarily more quality than us are grinding\nout results. Though we digress. More\non that in the next few weeks... watch\nthis space!\nOur next question is \u2018are you Healthy\u2019\n(capital h required)? We are approach-ingtheendofhealthylivingweekwhere\na host of activities and demonstrations\nhave kept us entertained courtesy of\nthe union and Sport Imperial. However the majority of us are less concerned\nabout body pump class at Ethos and\nare in the union bar planning a Friday\nnight on the town to consume obscene\namounts of alcohol followed by a greasy\nkebab. My point is this: Is the sporting\natmosphere of \u2018play hard, drink hard\u2019\nany more healthy than the \u2018work hard,\nwork hard, work hard\u2019 ethos whereby\nyou sit in front of a computer each day\ndoing no more activity than skulking to\nthe toilet each hour?\nRant over... generally sports are doing well as you can see from all the reports sent in. We am sure they will be\ncelebrating with a gooseberry smoothy\nwhile debating their league position.\nThe Gore-tex transalpine run is an\neight day ultra-marathon stage race\nacross the German, Austrian and Italian alps consisting of 300km of technical trail featuring over 14000m of\nheight gain. For some reason I had entered it... again.\nThe first day was not intended to\nbreak the competitors in gently. It\u2019s\nalmost marathon distance of 37.7km\nand 1200m of elevation gain was about\nequivalent to anything I\u2019d ever run be-fore. Despite this, it went smoothly to\nbegin with, until we reached the first\nhill and most people lessened their\npace, except Hilary, my partner. I could\nsee my week was going to be difficult.\nAs we reached the final checkpoint of\nthe day, my exertion showed dramatically as I collapsed with cramp. The\ntough pace and the blistering heat\nhad taken its toll. The race support\nteam however, were quick to put me\nin the shade and start stretching my\nlegs for me (I felt like a proper athlete\nand everything)! With minor delay we\nwere back on the trail and heading to\nthe end of day one. We finished 16th\nwith a time of 4:28 and discovered that\nover 60 teams had entered the mixed\ncategory \u2013 a large increase on last year.\nI was pleased but we both wanted to\ndo better.\nDay two was the longest day of the\nevent, and something we had been\nconcerned about since the route had\nbeen published months before. It featured 48.5km (30.3 mi) and nearly\n3km of elevation gain. The day was hot\nagain, and the previous day\u2019s exertions\nhad not been forgotten. To cut a story\nshort, half of this day involved me being force-marched by the shouting Sergeant Major Hilary Dyer and wouldn\u2019t\nrank in my top 10 days ever, but easily\nscores highly for memorability. However, many teams found the day difficult and we finished 13th with a time\nof 7:56 and a feeling that we might be\nthrough the worst.\nThe third day demonstrated some\ncompassion from the organisers as the\nshort 27.6km (17.2mi) and only 1504m\nof elevation would allow the competitors to recover. Despite still feeling the\neffects of the previous day, we fought\non to finish 14th with a time of 3:59.\nOn the morning of the fourth day I\nbegan to feel better. The previous day\u2019s\nrecovery had helped and I felt like my\nresting pulse rate was actually back\nbelow 200. The stage had 46km and\n2051m of elevation waiting for us but\nfor the first time, I felt confident I could\ndo it. This confidence turned out to be\nwell placed as I enjoyed the day\u2019s race,\neven getting to play the \u2018encourager\u2019\nfor a section instead of being encour-aged. The day finished well as we were\nplaced 8th to our mild disbelief finishing in a time of 5:37. I shall let Hilary\nfinish the story:\nThe fifth stage had only 1500m climb\nto allow a little recovery from stage 4.\nThe day began with 22km downhill\nalong the Prettau valley, run predictably fast, and then one steep climb up\nto a ski station. The long, winding forest track at the top of the climb played\nhavoc with our tired mental state as it\nseemed to go on forever, and the race\nfinished with a fast zig-zag descent\nthrough forest into Sand-in-Taufers.\nContinued on page 37\nImperial College at the\nGore-tex transalpine run\nRSM win?!\nMining football hits a two year high, see page 38\nNeil Dowse & Hilary Dyer\n\n"

I certainly hope\nit hasn\u2019t been this busy for you. Busy\npeople get stressed, and stressed people do bad things. Bad things lead\nto heart attacks. I can tell you that I\nam almost at that stage. If there is no\nCoffee Break next week then you will\nknow why. Please tell my mother I love\nher. My collection of DVD\u2019s are to go to\nmy brother, and my laptop destroyed,\nmelted down and reformed into a statue of me.\nI am afraid again there will be no\nSikh MC this week. In an executive\ndecision, he\u2019ll appear next term, and\nwe have various ideas for the character to introduce in the third term. The\nFUCWIT league is going strong. I was\nmighty impressed with the number of\nentries this week. You guys obviously\nwant to win an iPod. Why the hell\nnot, it\u2019s all about the reader participation in felix. The more you enter and\nthe quicker you submit your entry, the\nmore points you win. What do points\nwin you? PRIZES!!! Oh yeah. We\u2019ll announce the winner in the first issue of\nthe spring term, so we can have the\nChistmas special crossword included\nin the fist give away.\nAt this point I\u2019d like to thank all of\nyou. Not only for the interest in what is\narguably the best section in any newspaper (puzzles and games. I\u2019m not that\narrogant), but I\u2019d also like to thank you\nforvotingformeintherecentelections.\nNo I didn\u2019t become the president of the\nUnited States of America, but you have\nvoted me in as your Student Trustee.\nAwesome stuff. Almost as awesome as\nthe competition in the nightlife section\nthis week. Flick on over for you chance\nto win a ticket to FABRIC on the 18th\nof November. Calvin Harris and Plump\nDJs will be there, and Plump DJs are\njust plain sick head. Only one way to\ndescribe this awesome night is by saying \u201cBUCK WILD.\u201d Don\u2019t worry if you\ndidn\u2019t win though. Tickets are only \u00a312.\nI\u2019m not sure if what I just wrote counts\nas advertising, but ah well.\nThe ever strong Snaky B continues\nhis reign of terror for another week. I\u2019ll\nbe honest with you guys, we\u2019re starting to run out of ideas. If you have any,\nemail them in to coffee.felix@imperial.\nac.uk and we\u2019ll be more than happy to\nuse them. This week Snaky B is Alex\nMcKee, who to be blunt, a lot of you\nguys won\u2019t know. We down here love\nMcKee for his witty banter, legendary\ncomments and awesome style. Don\u2019t\nworry if you have no clue what\u2019s going\non, we\u2019ll get some one you know next\nweek.\n6. Top Gear:\nOne of the most watched shows\nevery year by student at Imperial College is Top Gear. Every\nwednesday when the new show\ncomes out I see at least 30 people\ncrammed in the common room\nwatching attentively as Jeremy\nClarkson waffles on about new\ncars, has his celebrity in the top\ngea reasonably priced car and sets\nthe Stig around the Top Gear track\nin a new sports car. The most enjoyable part of the well produced\nshow being the random challenges Clarkson, Hammond and May\ncomplete every week. In the most\nrecent episode they became lorry\ndrivers, entertaining up with power slides, races and crashes. It\u2019s\nthe kind of comedy more suited\nto adults, and apparently Imperial\nCollege students. This may be the\nfact student appear more mature\nat IC. Thusly understanding the\ngrumpy old men and their rants.\nCoffee Break\n34 felix Friday 07 November 2008\nThis weeks winner. Team Rubbish Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild.

Rosie and\nthe Goldbug, an up-and-coming band\nfrom Cornwall were set to play at 9pm\nas part of their European tour.\nA delayed start incurred, but when\nthe band finally started their set, they\nwere only met by a small selection of\npeople, the large majority sitting down\nat tables on the near end of the club.\nThe lead singer had to work increasingly hard to coax the otherwise timid\nand unexcitable \u2018crowd\u2019 into looking\nlike they were having some form of\nenjoyment.\nRosie and the Goldbug were of a\nstandard rarely seen of a band playing at the Union, but what seemed like\npoor advertising prior to their event\nmeant they and another support act\nwere given little attention. The main\nfocus of the marketing was solely focused on the DJ set by Colin Murray.\nThis marketing had seemed to work,\nas an influx of people arrived in the\nhour before the start of Murray\u2019s per-formance. However, felix can reveal\nthat the Union took seemingly desperate measures to ensuring that more\npeople turned up. Impromptu posters\nwere placed around and in the Great\nHall, contradicting their own poster\npolicy, indicating that all \u00a315 paying\nguests of the Ball were also invited \u2018free\nof charge\u2019 to the otherwise \u00a36 Union\nevent.\nStewards that were hired by the faculty unions were also reported to have\nbeen telling students to go to the Union, something that greatly angered\nthe faculties as they had hired the very\nsame stewards for the Ball. Several\nmembers of the faculty unions then\nproceeded to go around the rooms and\nremove the posters.\nKatya-yani Vyas, RCSU Vice President (Activities) told felix that \u201cIt was\npresumptuous of the Union to assume\nthat they could automatically override\na faculty union event. They should\nhave had the politeness to at least enquire if it would be OK with us.\u201d\nThis apparent \u2018ploy\u2019 by the Union\nseemed to have worked, with Colin\nMurray playing out to a near full-house\nin dBs, most of which, felix was told,\nconsisted of students from the Masquerade Ball. However after the event\nin the Union, several students were\nheard saying that they preferred the\nBall over the Union event.\nDavid Charles, RCSU President\ncommented on the whole event by saying that \u201cThe tactics used by the UnStudents \u2018stolen\u2019 from\nMasquerade Ball\nion on Friday night were unhelpful at\nbest. I feel that an attempt was made\nto undermine an extremely successful\nevent. It\u2019s a perfect example of what\nwe should avoid as a union. In fact, I\nwould go as far as say that it damaged\nthe reputation of the Union.\u201d\nMr Charles did also propose a possible solution, telling felix that \u201cClearly,\nthe Union is struggling with attendance but has the money to recruit big\nnames. Instead of blocking faculty unions from booking DBs on big name\nevenings, invite us to host them. We\nare on the same team after all. Could\nyou imagine Colin Murray etc at a TriUnion Club Night at DBs. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d\nMark Mearing-Smith, CGCU President had similar views.\n\u201cQuite frankly it is unacceptable that\nthe Entertainment department just\nbudge into our event. One of the members of staff told me during the meal\nthat our ticket holders have free access\nto the Union, which I said thank you to,\nthen he said that I should tell everyone.\nI just smiled, knowing full well that I\nhad a minimum bar spend to reach\nand people moving over to the Union\nwould not help. So I didn\u2019t tell people.\u201d\nMr Mearing-Smith then went on to\nsay: \u201cI do not think that it is fair that a\nclub/society puts in so much time to an\nevent, (also that we are unpaid volunteers still studying) and they just think\n\u2018oh they will not mind, it\u2019s only good\nImperial to set\nup new robotics\ncentre in Qatar\nEarlier this week, Imperial College\nLondon had agreed upon establishing a centre for robotic surgery at\nthe recently opened Qatar Science &\nTechnology Park. This new centre was\nagreed upon with the Qatar Foundation, who host a community of elite\ninternational partners including the\nUniversity of Oxford, and aim to be\nthe Middle East\u2019s hub of education and\nresearch.\nThe work carried out at the Qatar\nScience & Technology Park will focus on commercially-orientated research and development, which will\nbe conducted alongside six leading US\nuniversities.\nThe Qatar Robotic Centre will focus\non medical robotic technology, including the further development of surgical\nprocedures which can be carried out\nto a degree of precision far beyond the\ncapabilities of the human hand. As well\nas focusing on research, the centre will\nalso train students and surgeons alike\non robotic medical technology.\nThe announcement made by the Qatar Foundation coincided with the visit\nof the British Prime Minister Gordon\nBrown to the flagship Education City\ncampus. He was reported saying: \u201cI\nwelcome the increasingly close educational and research links between top\nBritish universities and Qatar Foundation. These two announcements form\nexciting new strands to our shared\npursuit of technological and academic\nexcellence. I congratulate Qatar Foundation, Imperial College London and\nOxford University.\u201d The reference to\nOxford University refers to the creation of an Islamic Studies Chair, which\nis endowed by the Qatar Foundation.\nQatar Foundation President Dr\nMohammed Fathy Saoud said: \u201cQatar Foundation is creating one of the\nworld\u2019s most exciting educational and\nresearch clusters because it knows the\nMiddle East region\u2019s future lies in the\ndevelopment of human capital and the\napplication of knowledge. We are partnering with elite universities that are\nleaders in select areas of education and\nresearch.\u201d\nSir Roy Anderson, Rector of Imperial College London, said: \u201cImperial\nCollege looks to translate research advances into innovations that improve\nquality of life, and we are thrilled that\nQatar Foundation\u2019s appetite for innovation matches our own. The use of\nrobotic devices in medicine is a field\nthat holds a great deal of promise, and\nthis is a wonderful opportunity for Imperial College to help make tangible\ncontributions to Qatar\u2019s scientific and\nmedical development.\u201d\nThe comments made by the Rector\ncoincide with those made at this year\u2019s\nCommemoration Day speech, where\nhe said that Imperial would be establishing \u201cfootprints\u201d overseas, including\n\u201ccollaborative research facilities.\u201d This\nis all in aid of ensuring that Imperial\nremains a world class institution, and\nby creating these \u201cfootprints\u201d it is believed that this will be the case.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nDaniel Wan\nNews Correspondent\nfor them\u2019. Time and time again they\njust f*@$ up with their Union events,\nthey over spend their budget, they get\ns*@$ attendance and annoy one of the\nstrongest part of our union, the clubs\nand societies.\u201d\n\u201cJust because they can\u2019t get people in\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they can stroll in to\nour event and draw people away when\nI gave no permission for them to put\nup any posters.\u201d\nWith the event clearly upsetting a\nlot of the faculty union, Mr MearingSmith asked ICU President Jenny Morgan what was going to be done about\nit, |she responded \u201cIt\u2019s being looked at,\ndon\u2019t worry.\u201d Mr Mearing-Smith told\nfelix that he was effectively being ignored and that the faculty unions were\n\u201cnot important enough\u201d in comparison\nto the activities and events of ICU.\nfelix has attempted to get a comment\nfrom the Union, however was unable to\nget any before the paper went to print.\nThe lack of an audience will inevitably dampen the reputation of Imperial\nCollege Union as event organisers to\npotential bands and other performers.\nWith Imperial College Union evidently\nupsetting so many people, the question that is on the lips of many faculty\nunion officials is what will be done to\navoid this problem in the future. The\npossibility of co-operation has interested clubs and societies, but would\nthat necessarily mean a full house for\nthe Union?\nNo fairytale ending for Zohair yet\nFew roller-coasters have as many ups\nand downs as the story of Zohair AbuShaban. felix first reported on the Palestinian electrical engineering student\non 10th October and since then he has\nhad his offer withdrawn and then re-instated, his dreams crushed, raised\nand possibly crushed again and the\nUnion has debated the issue in a controversial Council meeting on the 3rd\nof November.\nFor much of October there was little\npublic activity regarding his situation.\nThere was no way to know if the Rafah\ncrossing with Egypt would suddenly\nopen and any action on the College\u2019s\npart remained behind the scenes. It\nwould seem that this was simply the\nlull before the storm; in the previous\nweek a flurry of activity and news has\nraised the hopes of Zohair and his supporters at Imperial. Hannah Theodorou, Deputy President Education and\nWelfare (DPEW), received the email\nfrom Zohair that set the weeks events\nin motion. In it Zohair told her that the\nRafah crossing was unexpectedly (the\nfear is that such events would be dangerous if advertised in advance) to be\nopened and that he planned to travel to\nLondon at the first possible opportu-nity. Zohair asked if he could still take\nup his place if he came to London im-mediately. Usually students are given\njust 2 weeks to take up their place and\nso Ms Theodorou re-iterated his offer\nof entry for the 2009/2010 academic\nyear but he later told Islamic Society, \u201cI\nreally wanted to join Imperial this year\nbut I don\u2019t know if the registry will reverse the decision or not. But if I have\nto decide, I will choose to attend this\nyear.\u201d\nZohair did indeed decide to attend\nthis year. He emailed Islamic Society\nand the Union that he would be coming to London even though he had\nbeen told that he didn\u2019t have a place.\nThis risky move forced the College\u2019s\nhand and in a meeting with the Rector,\nJennifer Morgan, Union President, was\ntold that this was a special case and if\nZohair arrived within the week, that\nhe would be allowed to begin his stud-ies. His department, as well as the Islamic Society, have made preparations\nto help him catch up with the work he\nhas missed. Zohair himself was un-pertubed about the work he missed,\n\u201cI\u2019m really sure I can cope with all of\nit [missed work]. Four week of lectures\nis not too difficult to catch up with; 1)\nI have read some of it already, 2) I have\nbeen working as a teaching assistant\nfor two years... 3) I graduated the top\nof my year. I know it\u2019s hard, but I am\ncapable.\u201d\nThe College was expecting Zohair\nto arrive on Wednesday but he contacted Saad Raja, Islamic Society President, to tell him that he did not make\nit through the crossing. For reasons\nthat are as yet unclear, it appears that\nZohair and around 400 other students\nwere sent back across the border after\ninitially making it through. The Rafah\ncrossing was expected to be open for\nseveral days but at the time of writing it was uncertain whether or not he\nwould make it to London. The College\ndescribed the situation as \u2018fluid\u2019 and\ntold felix that eventually his place at\nthe university will have to expire.\nNew Council Chair survives his first test\nT\nhe above information\nwas unknown to Salman\nWaqar and Yoni Weiner,\nproposers of the motion\nheard at Council which\naimed to start a campaign with Union\nsupport that would raise publicity for\nZohair and put pressure on the Israeli,\nEgyptian and British government to\naid his passage from Gaza. It called\nfor, amongst other things, protests at\nthe Israeli and Egyptian embassies if\nprogress was not forthcoming. Over\n200 Imperial students signed a petition in support of Zohair which was\nattached to the motion. Council Chair\nAfonso Campos informed Council of\nthe morning\u2019s developments and advised the proposers that the motion\nwas no longer relevant and indeed\nthat even if it was, it contained certain\npolitical judgements that could not be\nacceptable for the Council to pass. As\nsuch, Mr Campos told Council that the\nmotion would not be voted upon in\nits current form. Mr Waqar, off-guard\nafter being presented with this new\nevidence, maintained that the motion\nwas relevant and questioned whether a\nstudent with extenuating circumstances should be denied a place due to the\n\u2018technicality\u2019 of a few days. After some\nto-and-fro between Mr Waqar and the\nCouncil Chair, Mr Campos decided\nthere was little point in continuing to\ndiscuss the motion and insisted that\nMr Waqar allow the Council to continue with the rest of the meeting. This\ncaused some consternation amongst\nCouncil members with the CAG Chair\nChristoph Aymanns calling out, \u201cWhy\nwon\u2019t you let him speak?\u201d. Another\ncouncil member told felix, \u201cpeople\nare going to have to face up to these\nissues eventually\u201d. Mr Campos even\nreceived a demand for an apology for\nhis handling of the matter but he was\nunapologetic stating, \u201cGiven the facts\nthat came to light earlier in the day, the\npaper became less relevant. As such,\nthere was a general sentiment that\nthe paper would clearly benefit from\nreworking to effectively target an is-Kadhim Shubber reports on the reception of the motion to Council that would give support to Zohair\nsue that is without a doubt of tremendous importance. I saw no point in\nkeeping Council engaged in fruitless\ndebate when there were other matters for decision on the agenda. The\npaper is welcome back at any Council\nmeeting in a reworked fashion. While\nsome questioned my decision, I do not\napologise for my actions and hope they\nare clearly understood.\u201d\n\u201cI really wanted\nto join Imperial\nthis year\u201d - Zohair\nAbu-Shaban\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nZohair giving a speech at his graduation in Palestine\nSalman Waqar, the papers proposer, putting a question to the Council Chair, Afonso Campos last Monday\nStudent Television of Imperial College\nGot an issue with the Union?\nTake it to Jenny Morgan, the Union President, in stoic tv\u2019s exclusive\n\u2018Ask the President\u2019 program, where the President is faced with your\nburning questions.

As sick as you may be of\nhaving the US presidential elections shoved down your throat, I\nfeel that it is necessary to provide some\nkind of conclusion to the American\nsaga that has dominated world politics\nin the recent months.\nWhen America sneezes the world\ncatches a cold, or so they say. This is an\nanalogy that has been reflected in the\ncurrent economic climate. Whatever\noccurs across the pond has a profound\neffect on us, and the election, at the\nrisk of sounding hideously melodra-matic, of the most powerful man in the\nworld warrants extensive media cover-age. Therefore we appreciate this political force-feeding; it\u2019s good for us.\nWell, it is over now, in any case. The\nanticipated triumph of Barack Obama\nover John McCain, the hours of cam-paigning, the descent from civilised\ndebating into a war of political attri-tion; ladies and gentlemen we have\nour victor. I am sure that, like myself,\nplenty of you will be breathing a sigh\nof relief. The Americans were wiser,\nperhaps from experience, voting for\nchange, categorically turning thier\nbacks on their racially discrminatory\npast. Hoorah! Top Hole! etc.\nSo much for the Bradley effect\nthen. I lost count, during the course\nof Obama\u2019s ascent to the forefront of\npolitics, of the number of times a commentator mentioned this. Opinion\npolls are informative, they would say,\nbut how many of these \u201cnew money\u201d\nAmericans would put their ballot paper where their mouth was and actually vote for a black president?\nThe Bradley effect is a theory proposed to explain differences in opinion\npolls and results in elections where a\nwhite and non-white candidate are\nrunning against each other. It is named\nafter Tom Bradley, an African-American who lost the 1982 Californian\nrace for governor despite being ahead\nin voter polls going into the elections.\nApparently we should have been apprehensive of this idea that people\nwould give an innacurate opinion so as\nnot to open themselves up to accusations of racism.\nThere is probably a kernel of truth\nin this analysis. I suppose, however,\nthat it is nothing more that speculative\nhole-picking, Barack Obama has won\nthe election and although I feel the\nutmost sympathy for Tom Bradley, it\nseems that lessons were learned from\nhis situation; perhaps there is hope for\ncivilisation yet.\nMcCain was gracious enough to\nwish Obama luck. there was an air\nof humility about him as he called for\nhis supporters to lend their backing to\nthe new President. A united America\nis fundamental, on that McCain and I\nagree.\nThe political atmosphere is chang-ing, developing even. Obama\u2019s victory\npromises that change is on the hori-zon. If America has given us a cold,\nperhaps the new president can provide\nthe antidote.\nOne of Barack Obama\u2019s great strengths\nhas been missed, under-estimated or\nignoredbymiddle-agedcommentators:\nhis appeal to young voters. This was a\ndemographic derisively dismissed in\n2000 and 2004 by the American Right:\nBill O\u2019Reilly \u2013 Fox News\u2019 prime pitbull \u2013 labelled them the \u2018stoned slackers\u2019, unconcerned about great political changes passing over their heads,\nlamely courted by the Gore and Kerry\ncampaigns, and turned off by conventional party politics, apparent success\nin Iraq and the creepy enthusiasm of\nthe Christian Right. Too many did not\nget involved, ignoring the race and lazily staying at home on election day.\nNow these so-called \u2018stoned slackers\u2019\nhave matured into politically engaged\nand energetic advocates for Barack\nObama, biting back against the far\nright-wing of the Republican party that\nhas insulted their intelligence, ignoring them for years. From watching the\nDaily Show late during lazy nights they\ncame to understand the frequent hilar-ity, hypocrisy and lunacy of conventional media and politics \u2013 especially\nFox News \u2013 that is not obvious buried amidst the boredom of TV news.\nIn part the shift was due to Obama\u2019s\nnatural appeal: the bright young\nSenator with the rhetorical skills of a\nCivil Rights leader casually but forcefully rebutting the Republican attack\nmachine. This is not to mention the\npositive discrimination of voting for a\ndeserving black candidate. But this is\nnot the full story. As Obama acknowledged in his acceptance speech for the\nDemocratic nomination, his rise is not\npurely down to himself, it is down to\nthe American people and this new\ngeneration. His promise of change enthused and inspired a generation that\nreached political maturity watching\nhelplessly as the Bush administration\ndismissed the Constitution, ignore international treaties and run roughshod\nover Congress, leaving America in tat-ters, hated worldwide and in economic\nmeltdown.\nThis generation did not experience\nAmerica\u2019s heyday in the 1980s, as Reagan, Thatcher and neoliberalism ruled\nthe free world and concluded the Cold\nWar. Hardcore Reaganite Republicans\nby now must be getting on; the only\nthing that motivated these social conservatives any more was Sarah Palin.\nThankfully the prospect of her replacing a deceased McCain terrified sane\nAmericans in the same way that it petrified the rest of the world. Like us in\nBritain, this generation is more global\nin its outlook: unlike, say Dick Cheney,\nthey understand for a favourable public image for America worldwide to\nbe favourable, in order to achieve its\ndiplomatic, economic, strategic and\npolitical goals.\nThe influence of the young on this\nrace was profound. Much has been said\nabout Obama\u2019s impressive campaign at\nthe local level. Although the campaign\nis soberly controlled from the top, the\nscale of voluntary manpower illustrates the excitement and enthusiasm\ncoming from the level of the ordinary\ncitizen. Large portions of Obama\u2019s\narmy of volunteers are from this young\ngeneration and predominately student\n(we tend to be the only ones with time\nand without serious responsibilities\nlike earning a living, paying a mortgage\nand other dull, real-life preoccupations\nlike that).\nAt the local level, these numerous\nsupporters spread the enthusiasm.\nThey put forward Obama\u2019s policies\nand promise of change. They criticized McCain\u2019s policies and derided\nhis decision-making and tempera-ment. They mentioned Sarah Palin.\nThey registered new voters in droves.\nThey encouraged early voting. They\nmentioned Sarah Palin. They held fundraising events. They mentioned Sarah\nPalin.\nHow did Obama get this traditionally\napathetic segment of society involved?\nThe Obama campaign skillfully used\nnew technology and social trends: with\nthe Facebook-style my.barackobama.\nDom Mclaver com making it easy to get large numbers of young activists involved from\nbehind their computers. Although local offices were monitored and man-aged, the Obama campaign has largely\ntrusted the \u2018youtube generation\u2019 to its\nown devices: donating their own mon-ey, working in their own time, posting\nvideos on the internet, making calls,\ngoing out and knocking on doors to\nget the vote out.\nEssentially they did the legwork in\norganizing communities, the same responsibility that Palin so gleefully denigrated in her speech at the Republican\nconvention and was met with a rapturous cacophony of hilarity by the Republican rank and file. This post \u2013 also\nheld by a younger Obama in Chicago\n\u2013 was also held by a certain Martin\nLuther King as he sought to mobilize\nlocal black communities in Atlanta.\nPalin\u2019s abuse reflected and embodies\nthe lack of curiosity of the section of\nAmerica she so perfectly represents:\nuncurious about America\u2019s diverse his-tory, uncurious about foreign cultures\nand religions, uncurious about people\ndifferent to themselves.\nThe pragmatic end of the Republican\nparty \u2013 the realists and the moderates \u2013 have recognised Obama\u2019s popularity with the young and some have\nswitched sides to hand over the reigns\nto a new generation. Most admirable\nwas Colin Powell\u2019s change, noting the\nfaulty worldview in both the rumour-mongering that Obama may be Muslim and in John McCain\u2019s reply to the\nwoman who distrusted Obama for being \u2018an Arab\u2019. He did not chide her for\nher casual racism; he did not assert\nthat any American \u2013 Arab, Muslim or\nwhatever \u2013 can become President. He\nmerely said Obama was a \u2018decent family man\u2019, as if Arabs are somehow incapable of this. McCain is not racist; he\nis an admirable, courageous politician\nwith unquestionable centrist creden-tials. If he had said what I just outlined\nabove, he would have been booed and\nprobably bottled off the stage (he was\nnevertheless booed anyway).\nFrom the standpoint of this cynical\nEnglishman, it is pure poetic ironic\nthat the community organizers, the\nstudents, the African-Americans and\nthe stoned slackers combined their\nstrength against a ruling ideology that\nneglected and derided them and, ulti-mately, proved so flawed: scraping its\nway to dominance by dividing America, lowering taxes for cash-hungry\ncorporations in return for their funding and support, supposedly shrinking\ngovernment whilst building an enormous deficit. They turned supreme\nexecutive power into a sycophant for\nthe military-industrial complex. Their\nmessage was propagated by Christian\nfundamentalist activists (partly in return for the spread of Creationism\nthroughout the US education system)\nand led by a ruthlessly effective electoral campaign often revolving around\nbrutal and immoral character assassi-nations. Its legacy is the world\u2019s economy in meltdown, primarily from the\nnon-provision of adequate regulation,\nand America embroiled in two messy,\nmurderous and expensive wars.\nThe joy of the American system is\nthat once every four years they get to\nget rid of governments they don\u2019t like.\nNaturally expectations for the Obama\npresidency are going to be unrealistically high. His administration will be\nconstrained by the economic crisis and\nworld events, not to mention unrealistic demands from his newly dominant party. There should be concerns\nabout his policies, most significantly\nhis populist tendencies towards pro-tectionism, potentially angering China\nand the Third World, not to mention\nworsening the world economic crisis\nas other countries follow suit.\nNevertheless, I am still jealous. Our\nparliamentary races really just don\u2019t\ncompare: in rollercoaster narratives,\nin soaring rhetoric and fiery clashes, in\nleftist media bias, in outrageous right-wingers, and in terms of the emotion,\nexcitement involved. It\u2019s not fair. No\nmatter how hard I try I just can\u2019t get\nexcited about NHS reform.\nThe Youtube generation and the stoned slackers versus Palin and Fox\nObama and the help\nBarack Obama in fine form, the model of modernity and reform is in contrast with Palin\u2019s seeming antiquated attitudes\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFriday 07 November 2008 felix\nPolitics\nPutin acts on economy\nThe name Oleg Deripaska has been\nspread across the news these past few\ndays, and pictures of his luxury yacht\nwhere he held dodgy meetings with Peter Mandelson and shadow Chancellor\nGeorge Osborne - allegedly regarding\nparty donations - have filled the news-papers. The Russian oligarch boasts a\nvast business empire centring around\nhis Aluminium company Rusal, yet despite Forbes Magazine ranking him the\nrichest man in Russia, and 9th richest\nin the world, he is among dozens of\nRussian oligarchs reckoned to have\nseen billions wiped off their personal\nfortunes due to the current global financial crisis. Deripaska may have lost\nas much as $16bn of his $28bn wealth,\nwhile the infamous Chelsea FC owner\nRoman Abramovich has lost about\n$20bn according to Bloomberg, overall\nhalf of Russia\u2019s 87 billionaires will no\nlonger be billionaires in 2009.\nThese losses are part of a wider trend\nin Russia at the moment where the\nmassive decline in its stock market is\ncausing massive upheavals to the political scene. As with Northern Rock here\nin the UK, the Russian government\nis bailing-out crisis-stricken banks\nthrough a $200bn fund, so far four\nRussian banks have been rescued like\nthis, including Globex which actually\nbanned customers from making withdrawals for several days after a bank\nrun in October. But unlike in the UK,\nits not just the banks which are being\nrescued, big corporations like energy\ngiants Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil,\nas well as Oleg Deripaska\u2019s Rusal and\nmany other companies in the mining\nand metals industries are all applying\nfor state assistance.\nThis assistance will come through\nbuying shares in them. At the moment\ncorporations are changing hands very\nquickly, and at rock-bottom prices\nthat would have been unthinkable\nthis time last year. With their $200bn\nfund, President Dmitry Medvedev\nand Prime Minister Vladimir Putin\nare also big players on this frenzied\nbuying-up scene, deciding which companies the government will purchase\nshares in (through the state bank VEB,\nVnesheconombank).\nWhat is significant about this state\nof affairs is that during the 1990s the\nsituation was exactly the opposite.\nThen the collapse of the Soviet Union\nand the communist system sparked a\nmassive sale of state-owned assets to\nprivate individuals, making Margaret\nThatcher\u2019s privatisation programme\nin the 1980s look trivial. It was nicknamed the \u201csale of the century\u201d and\nthese scrappy entrepreneurs made\ntheir fortunes overnight, becoming\nthe super-rich oligarchs of today. With\nliterally too much money than they\ncould spend, this elite class of Russians has become renowned for their\nextravagant spending, investing in\nEnglish Premier League football clubs,\nbuying expensive old Soviet-era art at\nLondon\u2019s Sotheby auction houses and\nindulging in the annual Moscow Millionaire Fair.\nBut picture Gordon Brown having to\nuse taxpayer\u2019s money to buy shares in\nprivately owned British Gas plc or BT,\nand you get an idea of current affairs\nin Russia for the coming few weeks.\nNow in what the Financial Times has\ncalled the \u201creverse sale of the century\u201d,\nMedvedev and Putin can choose which\ncompanies the government will partially nationalise in a selective and non-transparent way, which leaves the door\nopen to favours being made to friends\nin big business, and arms being twisted\nto accept deals. That the culture of corruption is more widespread in Russia\nthan other developed countries is no\nsecret, so many observers believe that\nthe government will use the global financial crisis to consolidate its power\nover Russia\u2019s biggest companies, and\nthat with state assistance may come\npolitical influence for lucky oligarchs.\nBut looking at the bigger picture in\nall of this, no one really knows the extent of the harm done to the Russian\neconomy due to this crisis. When one\nlooks at its $500bn Foreign Exchange\nReserves - the third largest in the world\n- which was accumulated largely from\nits oil & gas exports in recent years, it\nseems Russia is prepared to weather\nthe storm. The official government\nline that the stock market decline is\ncompletely the fault of problems with\nPrime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev are coming under increasing pressure to secure the Russian economy\nHassan Joudi\nAs the chairman of Labour\nFriends of Iraq, what would be\nyour advice to President Obama\non his overall Iraq strategy?\nI think it will be a great thing if he will\nactually go there and see the public\nabout it, meet the people and say that\n\u2018we want to really help you to move\nforward\u2019. I think he should certainly\ngo and see the Kurds, because I think\nthe Kurds set a role model of what Iraq\ncould become.\nI think obviously there are issues\naround the American presence in Iraq\nand the change that should come about\nwhen the top man is being changed.\nClearly, I think the sooner the troops\nare withdrawn from Iraq the better for\neveryone concerned.\nI think also he should say \u2018we are\nnot going to leave the country with\nits reserves\u2019. Whatever the reasons the\npresent administration had for going\ninto Iraq, and that might have included\ntrying to get the reserves of oil, should\nnot be part of the new administration\u2019s\nview of going forward.\nIf that is part of the view, I believe\nthat the potential of good that could\ncome from the new president Obama,\ncould be lost.\nI think he could be a real force for\nchange in the world, and the key place\nwhere he could really make his mark in\nthe world is in Iraq and in Kurdistan.\nThere is a long bad history from UK\ninvolvement in Iraq. We did not create\nKurdistan when we should have and\nthere are a lot of things that have come\nout of that, in the same way that we did\nnot create the Palestinian state when\nwe should have.\nI think it might be hard in these economic times but if the Iraqi government needs economic support Obama\nshould go with that, help them with infrastructure projects, because I believe\nthat in the long-term Iraq and Kurdistan can be real allies, for all of us, as\nthere is certainly a lot of opportunity\nand goodwill there.\nHave you publicly supported\nBarack Obama all along?\nAbsolutely, but I supported the Democrats regardless.\nIn a report of June 2008, one of\nyour recommendations to the\nBritish Parliament was to raise\nawareness of the genocide in Iraq\nagainst the Kurds. What progress\nhas been made in Britain regarding this matter?\nCertainly not very much. I was involved in the Trade Union before I became a MP. And the Trade Union was\nstrongly against the Iraq invasion, as I\nwas at the time and I still have issues\non whether we should have done it.\nBut what I am clear of is that we\nshould have been there with a much\nmore evident role when the Anfal\n[genocide against the Kurds] was going on.\nThat is when we should have really\ngiven the Kurds support. It is trying to\nrewrite history, but having gone and\nseen what happened, having met people who have been through it all and\nhaving seen the Red House in Sulaimaniya, the human race should have opposed it. All we can do now is try to\ncreate space for people.\nWould you consider starting an\ninternational cooperation for this\ngoal? Dutch MPs Harry van Bommel and Fred Teeven have started\na similar campaign. Would you be\nprepared to work with them?\nIf we can do anything to help the people of Kurdistan within reason, I think\nit is important that we give our support to the things that quite clearly\nshould have never happened, more\nthan happy.\nDave Anderson MP talks to felix about Iraq\nDave Anderson, Labour MP and member of committee on Kurdistan\nRaz Jabary\nUS banks and nothing else must also\nbe comforting to Russian citizens. But\nobservers see the government as still in\na state of denial, unable to accept that\nthe political instability, largely due to\nthe August 2008 Russian-Georgian war\nand the apparent return to Cold War\npolitics, has weakened the economy.\nUltimately Medvedev and Putin have\ntwo things to juggle. To competently\nmanage the government\u2019s new nationalised assets, and to the minimise the\neconomic problems of inflation and\nlow wages on a Russian public that has\ngrown used to the 7% annual growth\ntenjoyed for several years. Like so\nmany times in its history, Russia is undergoing a huge amount of change in\na short space of time, the smoothness\nwith which this occurs will determine\nthe impact on the rest of the world.\n\n"

Presented by\nAdam Rutherford and Kerri Smith, the\npodcast focuses on one or two papers\nthat are particularly relevant, well-re-searched or just plain odd.\nThis week research into the 2004 tsunami finds it may not have been as\nunique as geologists initially though;\nmore bad news for amphibians in the\nform of a herbicide that increases susceptibility to disease; and the Antikythera Mechanism \u2013 if it sounds like\na Dan Brown book that\u2019s because it\nprobably could be \u2013 an ancient Greek\n\u2018computer\u2019 thought to be the world\u2019s\noldest. Also, it\u2019s great to hear scientists\nlaying into economists for being as irrational as teenage girls (apologies to\nany teenage girls reading). They pack\na lot into half an hour, and end with\nsome controversial science-related\nnews stories. My favourite was Sarah\nPalin\u2019s anti-fruit fly stance. Yes, terror\nhas a new face...and it\u2019s got compound\neyes.\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/\nScience Podcast\nNature\u2019s main rival also has a podcast,\nand it has the merit of being presented\nby Robert Frederick, who surely has\nthe smoothest voice around since Ron\nBurgundy quit Scotch.\nFollowing a similar format, the podcast showcases a few stories from each\nweek\u2019s magazine along with interviews\nand a smattering of in-depth analysis.\nA thoughtful account of blogging Chinese scientists aside, I found most of\nthe content uninteresting, and at certain points the show took on the air\nof Sesame Street (\u201cHello Bert\u201d; \u201cHello\nErnie\u201d...).

(Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Science, DOI:10.1073/\npnas.0803634105).\nFelix Whitton\nreviews journal\npodcasts\nTonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana)\nuse true vote to decide group move-ments. A new study, presented at the\nEuropean Conference on Behavioural\nBiology in Dijon France, shows for\nthe first time how animals may reach\na consensus by voting before executing behaviour that concerns the whole\ngroup. The study also shows that individuals support the majority vote\neven though they may disagree with\nthe decision.\nC\u00e9dric Sueur and Odile Petit, biologists from Strasbourg University and\nthe National French Centre of Scientific Research say that their \u201cresults\nproved that voting does not exist only\nin humans\u201d.\nTonkean macaques live in groups\nand inhabit islands in Indonesia. Each\nmorning they have to reach a consensus on where to go foraging that day,\nweighing issues such as food avail-ability, predation threat and possible\nencounters with other groups. But instead of an obvious lead from a dominant animal any group member can\nexpress an opinion by showing specific\npre-departure behaviours, indicating\ntheir preferred direction of movement\nthat day.\nSueur and Petit wanted to know how\nthe whole group ends up moving in\na single direction when several individuals suggest different directions.\nThey observed two semi-free groups\nof macaques and recorded which individuals expressed their opinions.\nWalking from 1 to 5m away from the\ngroup counted as a suggestion/opin-ion to move in that direction.\nThe results showed that the group\nalways chose the direction that was\nsupported by the most votes. Individuals that suggested other, less popular\ndirections gave up their choice and\nsupported the majority vote. Sueur\nsays this is the first demonstration\nthat voting is not unique to humans\nand might in fact exist in a variety of\nanimals.\nIn an August\u2019s issue of Science, James\nFowler, a political scientist from the\nUniversity of California in San Diego,\npublished his results showing that the\nhuman tendency to vote is highly he-reditary. Asked to comment on Sueur\nand Petit\u2019s findings, he said \u201cthis is\nan important study for linking voting\nbehaviour in humans to behaviour in\nother primates\u201d. However, he adds that\nhumans vote because different individuals benefit from different things\nand humans think they know which\nchoice is best to achieve those things.\nMacaques all benefit from the same\nthings (surviving, finding food) but\n\u201cgenuinely do not know which choice\nis best\u201d to achieve those things. Hence\nthey rely on the higher probability of\nbeing right if they go along with the\nmajority. He concludes that to really\nsay that monkeys vote like humans\n\u201cresearchers must show that the monkeys achieve consensus even when\nthey would individually benefit from\ndifferent outcomes. \u201cIf these were hu-mans, I would just ask them what they\nwant, but with monkeys I imagine it is\nharder to know what they want.\u201d\nMonkey democracy\nCredit: cedric sueur, strasbourg University\nScientists have identified a new target\nin pain control that could prove more\neffective than morphine.\nA team at the University of North\nCarolina, USA, has discovered that\nthe prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP)\nenzyme, a tumour suppressor found\nin the prostate, is also located in pain-sensing neurons.\nUsing knockout mice, the researchers found that a lack of PAP resulted\nin increased pain sensitivity in chronic\npain states.\nConversely, an injection of PAP into\nthe spine reduced sensitivity to painful\nstimuli.\nWhat is more, the effects of this\ninjection lasted far longer than that\nachieved using morphine, the current\n\u2018gold standard\u2019 in pain control.\nThe PAP enzyme is now thought\nto work by converting an extracellular substrate to adenosine, a known\nanalgesic in mammals. (Neuron,\nDOI:10.1016/j.neuron.2008.08.024)\nLike fingerprints, the whorls of stars\nthat make up galaxies come in an amazing variety of patterns.\nAnd like fingerprints, these patterns\nappear to be largely independent of\nenvironment \u2013 new research suggests\nthat whether a galaxy ends up as a \u2018giant spiral\u2019 or an \u2018extreme dwarf\u2019 can be\npredicted simply from its mass.\nDisney and colleagues scanned the\nsky for 200 galaxies, sizing each one\nup on seven different parameters that\nshould affect morphology.\nAll the parameters correlated with\neach other, agreeing with other recent\nstudies that have found surprisingly\nsmall effects of a galaxy\u2019s interstellar\nsurroundings.\nThis challenges current theories of\ngalaxy formation, which describe a\nchaotic history of collisions, neighbourhood interactions and feedback\neffects.\n(Nature, DOI: 10.1038/nature07366)\nUsing genetically modified nematode\nworms, researchers at Liverpool University have identified gene mutations\nthat they believe cause higher alcohol\ntolerance: shedding light on why some\npeople \u2018hold their drink\u2019 better than\nothers.\nThey investigated amino-acid alterations in two worms carrying mutations\nof the same gene and found that both\nmutations reduced the negative behavioural effects of alcohol, allowing more\nto be consumed before any adverse\nphysical reactions occurred.\nThe gene they investigated corresponds to a gene in humans that performs the same function in the nervous system, making it now possible,\nthey hope, to search the human gene\nfor changes that could help identify\nindividuals with a predisposition to\nalcoholism. (Mol. Biol. Cell published\nonline October 15, 2008, 10.1091/mbc.\nE08-07-0689)\nResearchers at the CIN2 laboratory in\nSpain have developed an ultrasensitive\nmass sensor with resolution of up to 1.4\nzeptograms (10-21 grams) at 5 degrees\nKelvin, five times finer than that of previous silicon resonators.\nThe device consists of a 1 nanometre\ndiameter carbon nanotube attached at\nboth ends to two gold electrodes.\nAtoms directed at the nanotube will\nstick to it, and this added mass causes a\nmeasurable change in the resonant frequency of the nanotube, which is used\nto calculate the atom\u2019s mass.\nThis device can measure the mass\nof proteins with atomic precision, and\nresearchers hope to increase the resolution enough to be able to monitor\nthe change of mass during chemical\nreactions.\n(Nano Letters, DOI: 10.1021/\nnl801982v)\nThere are now twice as many people\nwith peanut allergies than in 1998, with\nabout 1-2% of the population of the UK\nand USA affected.\nThe allergy mostly develops in early\nchildhood, and usually remains for life.\nAside from being a massive inconven-ience, the most severe anaphylactic reaction can be life-threatening.\nNow researchers at King\u2019s College\nLondon and the National Institute for\nHealth Research Biomedical Research\nCentre have found that children that\neat peanuts from infancy have a much\nlower chance of developing peanut al-lergy. This is against the current advise\noffered in the UK- which is for children\nat \u2018high risk of peanut allergy\u2019 to avoid\nthe nuts altogether. The lead authors of\nthe study, Professor Gideon Lack, and\nDr George du Toit emphasise that they\nwould not advise going against Department of Health guidelines \u201cthis study is\nby no means conclusive and that there\nare numerous other factors that could\nnot be controlled for and could have\ninfluenced the results\u201d.\nProf Lack is currently heading up\nanother study that is hoped will give\nmore conclusive results - it is the largest randomised controlled trial of peanut allergy avoidance- with results expected in 2014.\nThis could lead to a greater understanding of how to avoid other food\nallergies, and this possibility for early\nprevention could literally save lives.\nUmia Kukathasan\nReference: KCL press re-lease: 31 Oct 2008 http://www.\nkcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.\nphp?news_id=936&year=2008\nPsychologists at the University of Rochester have published a study in the\nJournal of Personality and Social Psychology, suggesting wearing red could\nmake you more attractive \u2013 if you\u2019re\nfemale.\nThey also found that men were prepared to spend more money on a date\nwith a woman in a red shirt, rather\nthan a blue shirt. The photos were calibrated to exact saturation and bright-ness, meaning the effect could only be\nattributed to hue.\nWomen shown the same pictures\nshowed no such bias when asked to\ngive an attractiveness rating, suggesting an unconscious link in the male\nmind with fertility. This behaviour has\npreviously been observed in nonhuman primates such as baboons and\nchimpanzees, which visibly redden\nwhen near ovulation.\nDeath-star insight on\nglobal warming\nMass Sensor with\nAtomic Precision\nNature, not Nurture\nfor Galaxies\nWearing red boosts\nyour attractivness\nA peanut a day keeps\nallergy at bay?\nMove over Morphine,\nthere\u2019s a new boy\nHolding your Liquor:\nWormy Drinkers\nContrary to headlines in certain national newspapers, a study carried\nout at the Institute of Food Research\n(IFR) does not yet directly point to the\nprevention of cancer by eating jams\nand jellies, the NHS Choices website\nsuggests.\nThe \u2018Behind the Headlines\u2019 guide\nto science draws attention to the fact\nthat the original investigation by Dr.\nPatrick Gunning and his team is very\nearly research, not even carried out\nin living cells and therefore as yet not\napplicable to humans.\n\u201cJamandJellycanhelpfightCancer\u201d\nreported the Daily Express, although\nboth contain a high proportion of\nsugar and are therefore not usually at\nthe top of the list for a healthy diet.\nPublished online in the FASEB Journal, the new study cites previous research which proposed that modified\npectin may \u201cinhibit the function of\nthe protein galectin-3 (Gal3)\u201d, considered to be \u201ca diagnostic marker and\na target protein for cancer treatment\u201d.\nDr. Gunning and his colleagues found\nthat a fragment of potato pectin called\ngalactan can bind to the recombinant\nform of human Gal3 and that this \u201cis\nconsistent with the molecular hypothesis for the observed anticancer\naction of modified pectin\u201d.\nHowever, there is much more research to be done before this can be\nextrapolated to the pectin found in\njam and jelly and the effect it may\nhave on the human consumer.

Innovation.\nEnsuring that the U.S. continues to\nlead the world in science and technology will be a central priority for my\nadministration. Our talent for innovation is still the envy of the world, but\nwe face unprecedented challenges that\ndemand new approaches. For example,\nthe U.S. annually imports $53 billion\nmore in advanced technology products than we export. China is now the\nworld\u2019s number one high technology\nexporter. This competitive situation\nmay only worsen over time because\nthe number of U.S. students pursuing\ntechnical careers is declining. The U.S.\nranks 17th among developed nations\nin the proportion of college students\nreceiving degrees in science or engi-neering; we were in third place thirty\nyears ago.\nMy administration will increase\nfunding for basic research in physical\nand life sciences, mathematics, and\nengineering at a rate that would double basic research budgets over the\nnext decade. We will increase research\ngrants for early-career researchers to\nkeep young scientists entering these\nfields. We will increase support for\nhigh-risk, high-payoff research portfolios at our science agencies.\n2. Climate Change\nThere can no longer be any doubt\nthat human activities are influencing\nthe global climate and we must react\nquickly and effectively. First, the U.S.\nmust get off the sidelines and take long-overdue action here at home to reduce\nour own greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe must also take a leadership role in\ndesigning technologies that allow us to\nenjoy a growing, prosperous economy\nwhile reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels\nby 2050. With the right incentives, I\u2019m\nconvinced that American ingenuity\ncan do this, and in the process make\nAmerican businesses more productive,\ncreate jobs, and make America\u2019s buildings and vehicles safer and more at-tractive. This is a global problem. U.S.\nleadership is essential but solutions will\nrequire contributions from all parts of\nthe world\u2014particularly the rest of the\nworld\u2019s major emitters: China, Europe,\nand India.\n3. Energy.\nAmerica\u2019s challenges in providing se-cure, affordable energy while addressing climate change mean that we must\nmake much more efficient use of energy and begin to rely on new energy\nsources that eliminate or greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. My\nprograms focus both on a greatly expanded program of federally funded\nenergy research and development and\non policies designed to speed the adoption of innovative energy technologies\nand stimulate private innovation.\nFirst, I have proposed programs that,\ntaken together, will increase federal investment in the clean energy research,\ndevelopment, and deployment by $150\nbillion over ten years. Second, it is essential that we create a strong, predictable market for energy innovations\nwith concrete goals that speed introduction of innovative products and\nprovide a strong incentive for private\nR&D investment in energy technolo-gies. These concrete goals include increasing new building efficiency by 50\npercent and existing building efficiency by 25 percent over the next decade\nand increasing fuel economy standards\n4 percent per year.\n4. National Security.\nTechnology leadership is key to our\nnational security. It\u2019s essential to create a coherent new defense technology\nstrategy to meet the kinds of threats\nwe may face\u2014asymmetric conflicts,\nurban operations, peacekeeping mis-sions, and cyber, bio, and proliferation\nthreats, as well as new kinds of symmetric threats.\nThis year, I was encouraged to see\nthe Department of Defense (DoD)\nrequested a sharp increase in the basic research budget for breakthrough\ntechnologies. More is needed. My\nadministration will put basic defense\nresearch on a path to double and will\nassure strong funding for investments\nin DoD\u2019s applied research programs.\nWe will enhance the connections between defense researchers and their\nwar-fighting counterparts. And, we\nwill strengthen defense research management so that our most innovative\nminds are working on our most press-ingdefenseproblems.Astrongresearch\nprogram can also lower procurement\ncosts by reducing technical risks and\nincreasing reliability and performance.\nRenewing DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) will\nbe a key part of this strategy.\n5. Water.\nSolutions to this critical problem will\nrequire close collaboration between\nfederal, state, and local governments\nand the people and businesses affected.\nFirst, prices and policies must be set in\na ways that give everyone a clear incentive to use water efficiently and avoid\nwaste. Regulations affecting water use\nin appliances and incentives to shift\nfrom irrigated lawns to \u201cwater smart\u201d\nlandscapes are examples. Second,\ninformation, training, and, in some\ncases, economic assistance should be\nprovided to farms and businesses that\nwill need to shift to more efficient water practices. Many communities are\noffering kits to help businesses and\nhomeowners audit their water use and\nfind ways to reduce use. These should\nbe evaluated, with the most successful programs expanded to other states\nand regions. I will establish a national\nplan to help high-growth regions with\nthe challenges of managing their water\nsupplies.\nIn addition, it is also critical that we\nundertake a concerted program of re-search, development, and testing of\nnew technologies that can reduce water use.\n6. Scientific Research.\nFederally supported basic research,\naimed at understanding many features of nature\u2014 from the size of the\nuniverse to subatomic particles, from\nthe chemical reactions that support a\nliving cell to interactions that sustain\necosystems\u2014has been an essential\nfeature of American life for over fifty\nyears. While the outcomes of specific\nprojects are never predictable, basic\nresearch has been a reliable source of\nnew knowledge that has fueled important developments in fields ranging\nfrom telecommunications to medi-cine, yielding remarkable rates of economic return and ensuring American\nleadership in industry, military power,\nand higher education. I believe that\ncontinued investment in fundamental research is essential for ensuring\nhealthier lives, better sources of en-ergy, superior military capacity, and\nhigh-wage jobs for our nation\u2019s future.\nSustained and predictable increases in research funding will allow the\nUnited States to accomplish a great\ndeal. First, we can expand the frontiers\nof human knowledge. Second, we can\nprovide greater support for high-risk,\nhigh-return research and for young\nscientists at the beginning of their ca-reers. Third, we can harness science\nand technology to address the \u201cgrand\nchallenges\u201d of the 21st century: energy,\nhealth, food and water, national security and information technology.\n7. Space.\nI will establish a robust and balanced\ncivilian space program. Under my ad-ministration, NASA not only will inspire the world with both human and\nrobotic space exploration, but also\nwill again lead in confronting the challenges we face here on Earth, including\nglobal climate change, energy inde-pendence, and aeronautics research.\nIn achieving this vision, I will reach out\nto include international partners and\nto engage the private sector to amplify\nNASA\u2019s reach. I believe that a revitalized NASA can help America maintain\nits innovation edge and contribute to\nAmerican economic growth.\n8. Stem cells.\nI strongly support expanding research\non stem cells. I believe that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on\nfunding of human embryonic stem cell\nresearch have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations. As president,\nI will lift the current administration\u2019s\nban on federal funding of research\non embryonic stem cell lines through\nexecutive order, and I will ensure that\nall research on stem cells is conducted\nethically and with rigorous oversight.\nCredit: Study Of A Woman In Red, Henner, Jean-Jacques\nDaniel Burrows\nScience Editor\nThe one at the top seems to be confused by the front ones behind\nPresident-elect Obama giving a speech\n\n"
