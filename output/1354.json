    "content": "10\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 1 June 2006\nU\nnless you\u2019ve been under a rock for the\npast couple of weeks, you are likely\nto have had a leaflet for Oxbridge\nEssays shoved in your face as you\nwalked around the South Kensington\ncampus. And for those that have skipped the front\npage story last week and went straight for the\nrugby boys naked centrefold, all is forgiven: I\u2019m\nhere once again to entertain and inform.\nOxbridge Essays is a company whose idea is\nsimple and brilliant: get students at Oxbridge to\nwrite your essays for you, charge extraordinary\namounts of money, pay the Oxbridge student a\nhappy amount so they have money to spend on\nPepsi and Sprite when they\u2019re in need of a tipple at the Advanced Algebra Society meeting on\nSaturday night, and pocket the rest of the money.\nMy initial reaction as I read the flier in a boring lecture was probably the same as the rest of\nthe student population at Imperial: \u201cOxford and\nCambridge\u2026\u201d followed by a few choice words\nwhich I\u2019ve been told by the editor I\u2019m not allowed\nto repeat. Upon closer inspection, however, it\nappears that Oxbridge may not be as guilty as\nthey first appear.\nThe company is actually owned by a student at\nBirmingham University and his brother at King\u2019s\nCollege. The former was recently cleared of bringing his university into disrepute because \u2018what\nOxbridge Essays does is entirely legal\u2019. Okay,\nthey have a sentence on the website stating that\nnobody should hand the essays in as their own\nwork \u2013 but I go on the assumption that people buy\nthese essays to plagiarise. If anybody reading this\nthinks that someone would pay \u00a31,440 for a 3000\nword undergraduate essay to an upper first standard and not hand it in, please write in to Felix and\nstate your opinion clearly, so I can send off your\ncomplimentary tin foil hat.\nSo why is the company so successful in the\nfirst place? It\u2019s reasonable to assume they must\nbe, since they keep recruiting more and more\nOxbridge students to write things for strangers.\nHowever, who in their right mind would pay that\nmuch for someone else to write what you could\nprobably do just as well yourself? And don\u2019t forget,\nthe Rector has made it perfectly clear that anyone caught buying and using these essays will be\nexpelled, which is more than fair. After all, if that\u2019s\nthe best thing you can think of to spend your\nmoney on, I\u2019m more than happy to advise.\nIronically, they even offer services writing\nOxbridge entrance essays to people wanting to get\nin, which means that in a few years\u2019 time, the people writing them for you might not even be good\nenough to write their own.\nAssuming an undergraduate studies a four year\nMaster\u2019s course at the Imperial international rate\naveraging \u00a315,000ish a year, that amounts to about\n60 \u201cguaranteed first\u201d fast delivery essays. The\nlast time I checked, Imperial\u2019s standards haven\u2019t\ndropped low enough that handing in fifteen not-even-upper-second essays a year (while simultaneously flopping your exams) is enough to get you\na degree. So who is actually silly enough to believe\nthat plagiarising ten good essays, which could\ncost the same as a nice new car, is going to get\nyou anywhere closer to success in the real world?\nSomeone must, because the company is making\nmoney \u2013 answers on a postcard.\nI was considering grouping together enough\nmoney to buy a 6,000 word dissertation about why\nImperial kicks Oxbridge into the middle of next\nweek. However, since my wallet can\u2019t support that,\nI\u2019m contemplating setting up my own company:\nImperial Essays, and I\u2019ll happily write your lab\nreport for you for a measly \u00a3500, which is a bar-gain. I\u2019ll even throw in a tin foil hat.\nJohn Sargent\nFormula sheets for a tenner, anyone?\nN\no \u2013 this isn\u2019t a TV programme (yet). Last\nweek, George Galloway said it would be\n\u201cmorally justified\u201d if a suicide bomber\nwere to kill Tony Blair, just stopping\nshort of calling for the assassination himself. But\nhe was not quite so clear-cut when asked whether\nhe would alert the authorities if he knew of such a\nscheme. He remarked what a \u201cmoral maze\u201d that\nquandary was before explaining how he would\nreport an assassination plot \u2013 not because that\u2019s\nthe law but because he feared the murder would\ncause an islamophobic backlash.\nI\u2019m happy to admit I\u2019m not a fan of George\u2019s,\nbut I\u2019ve never had any sleepless nights thinking\nabout whether or not to report anyone conspiring\nto murder. Even if you did follow Galloway\u2019s logic\nthat by ordering our armed forces into action,\nBlair is responsible for the deaths at their hands,\nit still does not follow that his death is in any way\njustifiable. Britain thankfully does not have the\ndeath penalty. By that sort of reasoning, vigilante\nretribution can be argued to be morally just.\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case in our society.\nBut it is far from clear whether Galloway\u2019s\nantics are motivated in the defence of Muslims\nor by his fierce opposition to America. Over the\nyears, he\u2019s been willing to fly as far as needs be\nto make acquaintance with dictator after dicta-tor, so long as they\u2019re hostile towards the United\nStates. After the first Gulf War, Galloway flew out\nto salute Saddam Hussein\u2019s courage, strength,\nand indefatigability. Last year, Syrian president\nBashar al-Assad received Galloway\u2019s praise only\nmonths after the assassination of the Lebanese\nPrime Minister, Rafik Hariri, whose death many\nbelieve to have been at the hands of the Syrian\nregime. But beyond that, Galloway supported\nthe USSR, saying that the \u201cdisappearance of the\nSoviet Union is the biggest catastrophe of [his]\nlife\u201d. More recently, he opposed the military action\nagainst Serbia which stopped the mass murder of\nKosovan Muslims. And now, Castro is the latest\nto get Galloway\u2019s praise, being referred to as his\n\u201cthe living person he most admires\u201d.\nGalloway aside, populist politics is rife in\nRespect. Back when Yvonne Ridley visited\nImperial, she boasted how Respect\u2019s candidates\nwere \u201ca rich multicultural mix of people\u201d. But\nit doesn\u2019t quite seem that way now in Tower\nHamlets. Of Respect\u2019s twelve councillors, all\ntwelve are Bengali. The fallout of their campaigning tactics has resulted in voting on racial\ngrounds. In some wards where only one or two\nRespect councillors were elected, it was the\nKhans, Begums and Munims that were elected\n\u2013 not the Townesends and Empsons that stood\nfor Respect. The likely cause of this is people\nonly voting for the Bengali candidates \u2013 a very\nworrying sign of divisions on ethnic and religious\ngrounds.\nThe far-left is keen to take on racism and populism from the BNP and other far-right parties.\nBut when the effects of racial tensions and religious divisions are evident in their own back yard,\nRespect has decided to capitalise on it rather than\nconfront it. If that\u2019s not the intention, the effect of\ncampaigning that splits the community is devastating and hard to undo. Their strategy to focus\non anti-war campaigning and targeting areas\nwith a high Bengali populations may be paying off\nelectorally. But when the dust has settled, such\ntactics leave a polarised populace, with the danger\nof those who feel disenfranchised voting for the\nfar-right. It\u2019s time Respect showed a little more\nrespect to the communities they now represent.\nAlon Or-bach\nGorgeous George\u2019s moral maze\nCOMMENT & DEBATE comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhis week the Brown Couch looks at student cheating. It was reported last week\nthat essays written by Oxbridge students\nwere available to buy online from upward\nof \u00a3500. The Brown Couch has investigated other\ninternet-based exam services such as Stan's\nExams (www.stansexams.com). Owned by Stan\nKalowski, once a cleaner at Imperial, the com-pany's main service is \"Precision Revision\" - in\nwhich students pay upward of \u00a3200 an hour for\none of Stan's employees (known in the trade as a\n\"Knowledge Man\") to do revision on their behalf.\nDuring the session, the Knowledge Man tackles\nthe difficult revision work facing the student. We\nspoke to Ralph, a 2nd year chemistry student and\none of Stan's current clients. \"I've been working\na lot with Montgomery - an expert Polymath and\nClassicist. When he's doing my work, I generally\nlounge around on Queen's Lawn or traipse around\ncampus. I worked with him a bit in the first year\nbut I didn't do very well in my exams. This year\nI've been working a lot more with him but despite\nthat, my first exam was last week and I still found\nit really hard \u2013 nigh impossible.\"\nFor students with more money to spend,\nthey can purchase the \"Executive Exam Plan\".\nStudents spend the month leading up to the\nexams involved in Precision Revision with\nSir DeVille Saint-Clare \u2013 the highest ranking\nKnowledge Man in the business. When the exams\narrive, Sir DeVille uses a faked swipe-card to legitimately sit all the exams in the student's name.\nWe spoke to Sir DeVille at his London residence.\nWith a grey handle-bar moustache, chained-monocle and diamond cane, he looks every bit the\nacademic Hercules you'd expect. \"I started as a\nknowledge man in the 1950s after obtaining my\n3rd undergraduate degree and 5th PhD \u2013 all from\nCambridge. My work used to take me on excursions all around the globe \u2013 I've sat exams on\nbehalf of the Prince Regent of Papua New Guinea\nas well as Mao Tse-tung's nephew.\"\nSir DeVille speaks 19 languages and is acknowledged as a world leader in almost all fields. He\nmoved to Stan's Exams in 2000 to reduce his workload at the start of his retirement. When asked if\nthere'd ever been any problems with ID checks\nwhen sitting exams, he just chuckled. \"Things\nwere a lot easier 40 years ago. Fashions have\nchanged and I think that now I look a little out of\nplace in my full evening suit [with tails, a cummerbund and silk gloves]. My slow, sloping cursive\nscript and Latin colloquialisms also looks slightly\narcane nowadays. Technology is also making\nthings more difficult. During the last exam I sat,\nthe barcode on my fake swipe card was scanned.\nWhen it registered an error, I had to charm the\nexam invigilator to take a lenient attitude.\" Our\nfinal question was to ask how much Sir DeVille\ncharges for his extraordinary services. He just\nlooked us up and down and laughed.\nMany students are too poor to afford the services offered by Stan's Exams \u2013 they have to rely\non more primitive methods. According to a report\nto be published in the Times tomorrow, the two\nmost common exam cheating methods used by\nImperial students are \"Toilet Breaks\" and \"Non-linguistic Communication\". The \"Non-linguistic\nCommunication\" method mentioned in the report\ndetails attempts made by students to use Morse\ncode, binary code and semaphore to pass answers\nand information around the exam room. Common\nsignalling methods include coughing, table-tap-ping and tribal tongue-clicking. One attempt was\nmade to use the specialist Hamley's teddy-bear\n\"Semaphore Sam\" to communicate circuit diagrams in an electronic engineering exam. The\nbears were brought into the exam under the guise\nof mascots, but the alarm was raised when an\ninvigilator and part-time Navy reservist watched\nthe four-inch flags and correctly decoded the mes-sage.\nNot all cheating, however, is deliberate.\nMillstone Water, a Scottish based soft-drinks firm\nhas released a new brand of water called \"Liquid\nLearning\". The bottle label is packed with scientific formulae, historical dates and passages\nfrom great works of literature. Intended as a\nrevision aid, the new product has caused many\nstudents to be removed from exams and expelled\nfrom their courses for \"possessing prohibited\nacademic material during the exam sessions\".\nMillstone Water is rethinking its product strategy\nand considering withdrawing its \"Revision-aid\nLemonade\". This has not stopped other manufacturers jumping on the revision-aid bandwagon\nwith the appearance of the Maths Mars bar, Smart\nSmarties, cheesy corn-based snack \"Swotsits\" and\nthe difficult to read Cadbury's Cr\u00e8me Egg-heads.\nBrown Couch\nSemaphore Sam\n\n"

I have\na number of points that I want to\nmake about the system and the food\nthemselves.\n1. The Cost \u2013 The the chicken\nskewers cost \u00a32 which is quite\nexpensive under any circumstance\nhowever especially when they are\ncompared with the \u00a31.76 baguettes\noffered by the Tiki Caf\u00e9.\n2. When I actually purchased the\nfood they got stuck in the machine\nand to enable them to be removed\nthe box was squashed beyond repair.\nThis is not an irregular occurrence\nas I have seen on a number of occasions the same thing happening with\nthe machines.\n3. I then chose to have them\nheated. Following the instructions I\nplaced them in the microwave and\npressed start. Indeed a quick 30\nseconds later I removed the food.\nThis was where the real problems\nstarted.\na. The box had started too disinte-grated.\nb. Then I opened the box and to\nmy dismay I found 3 \u201ctiny\u201d pieces\nof chicken. The combined weight\nof which could not have been more\nthen the weight of the money I paid\nStar\nLetter\nBiomedical\nSciences closures\nFelix and, more importantly, the staff\nconcerned remain totally unware\nwhat the future holds for Biomedical\nSciences at Imperial.\nWhen we asked College to provide\nus with full details of the planned\nclosures and job cuts, we were only\ntold that College \u201care protecting\nthe teaching\u2026students and facilities will not be affected\u201d. There was\nno mention as to the job security of\nthose employed in the BMS division.\nFelix is the students\u2019 newspaper, but\nit is read by most staff members at\nImperial.\nWe understand the staff will be\ninformed of the decision today. Felix\nhopes that College has the sense to\ntreat its employees with the respect\nthey deserve.\n11\nfelix\nThursday 1 June 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nLax security in\nCollege, again\nDespite College focusing heavily on security concerns, notably\nOctober\u2019s dress code, this is the\nthird lapse in security Felix has\nuncovered this year.\nOn most occasions we gained\naccess to forbidden areas by simply\ntailgaiting others through resticted\ndoors. Staff and students need to\nbe aware of those around them and\nnot hold doors open for people they\ndon\u2019t know.\nEven though we may not have\naccessed any highly classified\nareas, it still brings into question\nthe security of this campus. Given\na bit more time and effort, we are\nsure we could have gained access\nto even more restricted areas.\nfor them.\nc. The appearance of the chicken\nwas nothing that would inspire you\nto eat it - in fact it wouldn\u2019t be wrong\nto say that it was just revolting.\nd. Then to top it all the food wasn\u2019t\neven what could be considered\nremotely warm.\ne. When I actually tried some of\nthe chicken it was horrible and had\nno flavour, the best part was the\nsauce provided.\nI tried this food to see what I\nthought I would be eating come\nexam time as it has been tipped as\nbeing the food available 24 hours a\nday during the exams. If I had an\nexam any time soon I would have\nbeen very hesitant to even think\nabout eating it due to any possible\nmedical repercussions. I do think\nthat the idea was good however I\njust feel that the action undertaken\nwas very poor and something needs\nto be done.\nEdward Judge\nPlease & thank you go a\nlong way\nDear Felix,\nForgive me for being a nag but I just\nfind it amazing and unbelieveable how\nrude people can be when they don't\nsay \"please\" or \"thank you\". I found\nthis quite a trend when I was helping out with Medical OSCE exams\nrecently, where not one even said\n\"please\" or \"thank you\" to the helper\nwho was going to hand them the needles and gloves. Furthermore, when\nlending pens, I find them handed\nback to me without a word of appre-ciation. I am quite compelled to stop\nbeing generous when I don't hear a\nhe author of the Star Letter received each week wins \u00a310\nWe want to hear your views\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nword of please.\nYou'll find it quite amazing how a\nlittle appreciation for our fellow students can go a long way and make\neveryone's day so much better, considering its rarity nowadays.\nyours,\nAva\n1st Year Medical Student\nPublic transport horror\nDear Felix,\nWhy is public transport so bad? My\nparents live in a hilly little place not\nso far from Manchester. Ordinarily\nI would get the wonderful Virgin\npendolino train from Euston (which\nmakes me feel less bad about the\nprice of the ticket), but the main\nline was closed this weekend, to my\ndismay. The National Rail website\ntold me to get a train to Nottingham\n(or Sheffield) from St. Pancras. This\ndoubled my journey time from a\nbearable 2 hours to more than 4.\nThe last step of the journey\ninvolved me using (gasp) a bus.\nGrowing up in Saddleworth has prepared me well for the terrible bus\nservice, but it has since worsened. It\ntakes another two hours to travel the\n12 miles from Manchester, and these\nbuses run just once an hour.\nReturning to London always\nmakes me think how much better things are here, and it amazes\nme that the government (initially)\nrefused funding for Manchester\u2019s\nMetrolink. I wonder whether the\npeople sitting in Westminster\nknow what lies beyond the limits of\nGreater London.\nDaniel\nThis is the\nthird lapse in\nsecurity Felix\nhas uncovered\nthis year\n\u201c\n\u201d\nOnly a pair of issues left!\nMake your point while you still can. Only 2 issues left.\n\n"

I have to\nsay it\u2019s pretty disappointing that the\nmajority of people are blokes trying\nto claim \u2018we hooked up\u2019.\nFacebook is more homo-erotic than\nspending a weekend camping with\nthe Rugby team. I dread to think how\nmany of you are getting off on these\nvery words, clutching the paper in\nyour sweaty hands, as you enjoy a\nprivate moment with Felix. It makes\na change from the amount of people\nwho use Page 3 for their wank-bank.\nSurely there comes a point when you\nmust realise that there is something\nwrong with you and surely that point\ncomes when your wastepaper bin is\nfull of \u2018used\u2019 copies of Felix and you\ncatch sight of yourself in the mirror,\nlimp, drained, and with ink stains\naround your rapidly fading Johnson.\nWith so many of you getting off on\nthe thought of my manly hairy chest,\nand so many of you getting off on the\nhairy chests on Page 3, I\u2019m beginning\nto notice a theme. Some of you are\nseriously repressed.\nMany times I have pondered on the\nstate of Imperial Boys whilst plowing\naway on whichever tart I happen to\nbe poking at that time (It helps me\nlast longer to think of you lot). Maybe\nyou aren\u2019t so useless with women\nafter all. Maybe the real reason is\nthat you are all Gay.\nNow listen, I am perfectly fine with\nyou being homosexual. I\u2019m a modern\nguy. I mean look at me, look at my fine\ncurly hair, I am clearly in touch with\nmy feminine side. It could be argued\nthat I was the first Metrosexual.\nAnyway, the more of you that are gay,\nthe more minge there is for the rest\nof us. Anything that makes it easy\nfor me to get my end away is okay\nby me.\nIt shouldn\u2019t really come as surprise\nto you all. As well as myself, there\u2019s\nThe Rector, who is clearly a Gay Icon.\nJust look into those eyes and swoon,\nfellas! London also has a thriving\nscene, and in fact, I\u2019m beginning to\nthink there are plenty of advantages\nto being Gay At Imperial.\nFor a start, you no longer have to\ndo all this needle in a haystack bullshit with trying to find a decent bit of\nfanny. You can\u2019t go anywhere without\nbumping into a bit of cock. You no\nlonger have to pretend to understand\nfootball. Girls also tend to be more\ncomfortable with Lance The Modern\nMan than they are with Dave The\nMuff Master.\nI think it\u2019s time\nto bring this column to a close.\nIf you\u2019ve got any\ncomments then\njust use the regular email address.\nI promise to read\nthem all.\nAnd then laugh\nand delete them\nof course.\n\n"

    "content": "8\nrover\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 1 June 2006\nNorwegian fun in Notting Hill\nnightlife nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSome of our more observant readers have noticed that over the past\nfew weeks, the factual content of our\narticles has been in rapid decline. No\nlonger do we dwell on such mundane\nitems as drink prices, entry times,\nor even club locations (apologies to\nall who visited 286 King\u2019s Road for\nMamilanji\u2019s. It is in fact 108.) At this\njuncture, we feel we must apologise\nonce more, as something rather special happened on Tuesday evening.\nWe left our Chelsea residence early\non foot, bound for the eclectic Notting\nHill Arts Club, renowned for its underground music showcases and bohemian clientele. Whilst strolling leisurely through the opulent surroundings of a leafy Kensington Garden\nsquare, we spotted a residents only\nChampagne & Smoked Salmon summer party in full swing.\nIgnoring the rather obvious fact\nthat we were dressed in an antique\nsilk smoking jacket and full fencing\nattire (plus \u00e9p\u00e9e), we walked boldly\nup to the gate and stated merrily that\nwe had just moved in to number 37b\n(We later found out there were only 35\nhouses in the square.) One hour, two\nbottles of Mo\u00ebt and half the salmon in\nLoch Lomond later, we had acquired\ninvitations to various parties from\nour numerous \u2018neighbours\u2019 including\na rather creepy landscape gardener\n(who may/may not be queer) who\ndwells at number 5.\nIt suddenly struck us that we had a\njob to do, so we respectfully bade the\nresidents of Vicarage Gate farewell\nand staggered on up to Notting Hill.\nWithin ten minutes we had arrived\nat the club (very close to Notting Hill\nGate tube) and with bouncers eyeing\nthe \u00e9p\u00e9e warily, we were escorted\nto the manager\u2019s office below. The\nclub was every bit as \u2018arty\u2019 as its\nname suggested, one wall bearing\na photographic exhibition, surrealist sculptures dotted about, and a\nmusic showcase comprised entirely\nof Norwegian bands (yes, you heard\nus correctly, Norwegian). It was upon\nfurther consultation with the management that we realised the house\nwas having a Norwegian night, under\nthe watchful eye of the headliner\n(and master of ceremonies) Dr Filth.\nTowards the end of the evening (after\nseveral beverages) we enquired of\nthe good doctor whether his title was\nindicative of 6 years at medical school\nor a mere PhD. As sensitive journal-ists, good manners preclude us from\nprinting his rather brusque reply (I\nalways thought Cnut was merely a\nmedieval king).\nThe music encompassed a wide\nNotting Hill Arts Club\nCheck day for prices.\nHHHHI\nMore free drinks for Felix at Notting Hill\u2019s most trendy club.\nrange of styles and moods, with one\nunifying core concept: the lyrics were\nentirely Norwegian and therefore we\ncouldn\u2019t understand a word.\nThis may sound hideous, but the\nmusic was fantastic to dance to and\nthe bands were all of a very high\nstandard (it\u2019s by no means a coincidence that those horn-hatted bastards won Eurovision). The house\nhas a long history for spotting rising\ntalents. The club assured us their latest find, Lilly Allen, a female rapper,\nwill soon be a household name. Watch\nthis space.\nAside from the music the bar was\nexcellently priced including a fantastic cocktail bearing the name Die of\nPleasure (\u00a34) (Note the factual infor-mation). The club is also unique in\nrunning a student friendly Saturday\nnight, with admission at \u00a36 (\u00a34 on\nguestlist).\nIf, like us, you prefer Baroque to\nBlur-Rock, a requiem to Eminem,\nor Rachmaninov to, oh fuck we can\u2019t\nfind another pun, the club also runs\na classical themed chill out evening\nonce a month, presided over by a DJ\nfrom Classic FM.\nTo round off, the d\u00e9cor was arty and\ncutting edge, the drinks were both\ncheap and tasty, and we are currently\ncontemplating holidaying in Oslo. The\nclub is affordable for students and its\nsmorgasbord of nights ensure that\nthere is something to suit all tastes.\nSome clubs we review (like Nag) are\nridiculous to the extreme. Some, like\nMamilanji\u2019s, are members only, but\nthis is the genuine article: a good club\nthat welcomes students. Hopefully all\nthe factual information you need!\nMoseli-Lynch and Lowely\nOooh. Norwegianish\nA little intoxicated and more than a\nlittle nostalgic for the days when you\ncould have a good Friday night out in\nShoreditch, our fine nightlife editor\nGregory and I set off on a mission to\ndiscover exactly what had replaced\nthe much-loved And Did We Mention\nOur Disco at Plastic People. We could\nnot have anticipated what horrors\nawaited us.\nOur Disco has been replaced by a\nnight called Spacebase, which apparently consists of a mind-boggling mixture of Jewish salsa and disco-funk,\nmaking for an experience somewhat\nakin to a rather under-attended Bar\nMitzvah.\nThe majority of the clientele seemed\nto have either randomly strolled in,\nlooking for somewhere to stay the\nnight, or were in some way related to\nthe promoters of the clubnight, and\nwere only there to freeload a bunch of\ndrinks. The DJ seemed to think that\nDjing meant playing a track all the\nway through, leaving a 3 second gap\nof silence, then starting the next one\nfrom the compilation album CD he\nfound in the bargain bucket at HMV.\nI would highly recommend this club\nnight if you want to be surrounded\nby predominantly foreign people, and\nlisten to music that is so bad it is an\noffence to your ears.\nAfter fleeing Plastic People in a\nrush, Gregory and I made our way\nround the corner to 333, a popular\nhaunt for people with no taste in\nmusic, but hell, with a queue that big\nit had to have something going for it,\ndidn\u2019t it? A friendly, somewhat scruffy\nlooking man on the door told us we\ncould expect to hear a ferocious mix\nof hard electro and rock and roll! How\ncould we resist?\nHaving queued for what seemed\nlike aeons and parting with an outrageous sum of money, we were finally in! The club has two rooms and\nafter enduring the brain-destroyingly\nhorrendous noise of some live band\nthey had playing downstairs, we settled into the main room where The\nSmiths entertained us briefly before\nthe nightmare began.\nImagine our dismay when the DJ,\nproudly displaying a Metallica t-shirt\non his chest, refused to serenade us\nwith the dulcet tones of Pantera (I\nbegged!) or indeed anything that was\nnot straight up gangsta rap. Having\nbeen promised a night of electro and\nrock and roll, Greg and I were somewhat surprised when the entire cast\nof Prison Break strolled out into the\nclub with microphones, for a live set.\nUpon escaping downstairs it\nbecame apparent that the entire club\nnight was simply an exercise in pairing up inherently incompatible genres of music as we found ourselves\nsurrounded by a sweaty horde of\ncowboys and hillbillies listening to a\ndelightful mix of 50\u2019s rock and roll and\nbluegrass.\nAlthough not quite the same as\nactually being in hell, this club night\ndid come close. However, if like most\nof the people in the club you are\nmore interested in taking drugs in\nthe toilets than enjoying some decent\nmusic, I am sure the whole experience would be a delight!\nAlex Baldwin\nPlastic People: Jewish Salsa party. With attitude.\nSpacebase - Plastic People\n\u00a36/\u00a35 Students.\nHIIII\nWe were\nsurprised when\nthe entire cast\nof Prison Break\nstrolled out into\nthe club.\n\n"

    "content": "The exhibition was divided into\nnine dimly lit galleries which the visitor had to pass through in sequential\norder. Starting with the bare bones,\nthe body is gradually built up by adding various body systems. The displays started off relatively tame, with\nan array of bones scattered across\na few exhibition tables, and a famil-iar-looking skeleton facing visitors\nas they entered the first chamber.\nMaybe this was to \u2018ease\u2019 people into\nthe experience more than anything,\nbut still provided me with an opportunity to show off first-year anatomy,\neven if incorrectly.\nIn the later galleries, the exhibits became much more intense. The\nbodies were arranged in a variety\nof positions, but unlike the previous\nBody Worlds, they were more athletic\nin contrast to their aesthetic coun-terparts. I did wonder how they kept\nthem so immaculately preserved and\nthought back to my days in the anatomy lab where we had to endure the\nsickening smell of formaldehyde the\nmorning after a night out. In fact, the\nbodies had undergone a \u2018plastination\u2019\nprocess, during which fluids were\ndrained and exchanged with plastics\nto make the bodies rigid, odourless\nand permanently preserved.\nSuffice it to say, such preservation\nwas not used to maintain bodies in a\nclinical,\u2018upright\u2019position.Throughout\nthe exhibition, bodies were displayed\nin various poses ranging from one\nman kicking a football to another\nplaying darts. Not a typical finding in\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWaking the dead\nChris Miles spends an unusual afternoon in the company of dead bodies and reflects on\nwhether the new von Hagens-style exhibition is more gratuitous than educational.\nscience\n6\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 1 June 2006\nT\nhe prospect of\nspending my afternoon looking at dead\nbodies at Earl\u2019s\nCourt was strangely\nalluring. This was\nnot because I have\na bizarre penchant\nfor necrophilia or enjoy the company\nof corpses, but more because I find\nthe human body truly fascinating and\nwanted to see whether I could stretch\nmy educational muscles further than\nspending an afternoon in the Felix\noffice.\nSuch eerie thoughts of human preservation instantly triggered visions of\nGunther von Hagens, TV personality\nand anatomist extraordinaire; a person who refuses to shy away from the\ncameras or cower from public scru-tiny. I had vague recollections of his\nChannel 4 series last year, where the\nhacking away of various body parts\nprovided a highlight to an otherwise\nconventional Thursday evening.\nUnfortunately for von Hagens, his\ndemeanour came across as that of a\n\u2018mad scientist with psychotic tendencies\u2019 rather than that of a \u2018humanitarian educator\u2019.\nHis previous exhibition, Body\nWorlds, shocked and fascinated millions of people around the world. Of\ncourse, it was by no means all sunshine and lollipops; the exhibition\ncaused widespread outcry after some\nof the plastinated bodies were found\nto have bullet holes in the back of\ntheir heads and led critics to label his\nwork \u201ca shameless Victorian freak\nshow\u201d.\nWith this in mind, I was shocked to\ndiscover that this year\u2019s exhibition\nwas not the work of von Hagens, but\nof an Atlanta-based company who\nobtained the bodies from a medical school in China. The organisers\nof the revamped Bodies exhibition\nassure us that it has no connection\nwith the original Body Worlds, but it\nhas still managed to invite considerable controversy. The organisers\nhave attracted attention not merely\nbecause of the gratuitous content,\nbut also because many specimens in\nmedical schools in China are made\navailable via unidentified donated\nbodies.\nIt did indeed take guts to go and\nsee an exhibition like this (excuse the\npun), but none of our group seemed\nparticularly concerned, and as the\nonly medic, I felt an obligation to at\nleast sound as if I knew what I was\ntalking about.\nEager and inquisitive, we eventually\napproached the exhibition centre on\na dreary Wednesday afternoon with\nhigh expectations and a fair share of\nanimosity; it took about 10 minutes\nbefore we discovered the way in and\nthen had to navigate past what only\ncould be described as an aircraft\nhangar (the entrance reminded me\nof the queue for Space Mountain at\nDisney World!). The silence was readily apparent. Reminiscent of a Chapel\nof Rest, the people waiting in the\nqueue were conspicuously respect-ful, which made the airport-like bag\nchecks even more peculiar.\nOne of the\nrooms seemed\nto shock more\nthan educate \u2013\nbabies at\nvarious stages\nof development\nwere curtained\nin darkness\nand set out in a\nsimilar fashion\nto watches on a\njeweller\u2019s table.\nOne of the twenty dissected bodies. Most of them come from Chinese medical schools, which has sparked\ndiscussions over the integrity of the organisers\u2019 intentions. (Photo: Vitali Lazurenko)\n\n"

The club\u2019s fortunes have\nchanged a great deal since the start\nof the year when it was divided and\norphaned, struggling to find temporary homes after being ousted from\nthe sports centre. Now training takes\npart three times a week in the plush\nsurrounds of Ethos. Managed by a\ndetermined committee, the club has\ngrown from strength to strength.\nThe skeptic may ask in what ways.\nTo start, members have responded\nenthusiastically. Though free swimming was available, they voted with\ntheir feet to take part in club-only sessions instead. Numbers have doubled\nwith alumni returning to train and\nhelp as skills dictated. Senior club\nmembers have volunteered to coach,\nwith noticeable results.\n\u201cThis year we\ninvaded the ACC\nDinner with the\nlargest turnout\nof any club.\u201c\nImportantly, the new pool has\nallowed swimming and water polo to\nbe reunited.

Team spirit\nhas been strengthened through fundraising ventures (Swim for Malaria/\nBT Swimathon) and rampageous\nsocial events.

Achievements out of the pool\nhave also been remarkable. Sakura\nHingley and Sophie Mitchinson had\nsuccessful Channel crossings, with\nSophie breaking the magic 10 hour\nmark. In doing so, she became the\nfastest UK swimmer of 2005. As this\ngoes to press, others are in preparation for similar attempts this year.\nIn keeping with the cold water\ntheme, we welcome Lewis Pugh,\nor more properly the Ice Bear, to\nPresidency of the club. Over the\nlast twenty years, he has pioneered\nextreme cold water swimming and\nhas a keen scientific interest in the\nsubject, collaborating with a number\nof leading physiologists. We look forward to a lecture on his experiences\nin the near future.\nWater polo has built on lessons\nfrom the IDEA League held in\nZurich last year.

Strong branding has been developed through sponsorship and guidance from Frutina (a\nsports nutrition company) and swim\nkit from Sport and Leisure. We are\nvery grateful to all of the above and\nthe Union for their ongoing support.\nWhat can we expect from the club in\nthe future? In the short term, a summer tour to Croatia is planned where\nlocal teams renowned for their water\npolo abilities will be challenged. A\nswim-tour of London\u2019s lidos has been\narranged to raise funds for this.\nIn the long term, we have only to\nlook at the club\u2019s ambitious mani-festo: a development scheme that will\nraise standards to those of universities competing in the upper third of\nBUSA. In doing so, water polo will\nrepresent the College alone. It is\nclear that the gains made this year\nwere predominantly related to the\namount of training time and quality of\ncoaching. For these needs to be met,\nit is vital that internal and external\nsupport is fostered.\nThe club\u2019s progress has been\nencouraging and members are looking forward to next year, assured that\nthe pattern is set to continue. With\nthe relevant bricks and mortar in\nplace, it only remains to be seen if IC\nSwimming and Water Polo can do its\nnew pool justice.\n\n"

Many people will\nturn around and say that there is\nno such thing as a \u2018league\u2019 but to\nthem I say denial. There are always\nexceptions, although when you look\nat the celebrity list the exceptions\nare normally gold diggers. We all\nknow how a spark is needed for\na relationship to get started, but\nbeauty can sometimes only be skin\ndeep. The solution here would be\nto broaden your outlook and not\nalways be so quick to reject. Now,\nI can\u2019t pretend to be a psychic (I\u2019ll\nleave that to Mystic Stars), but I\ndoubt that your penchant for beautiful women is going to cause you\nto end up all alone. If you\u2019re really\nthat worried though, aim to get\nrich quick. Then you\u2019ll have loads\nof flashy girls running around after\nyou, but they\u2019ll only want you for\nyour money and they\u2019ll either be\ndumb as can be or scarily conniving.\nJust take it slowly, I mean you\u2019re\nstill in uni.

As I didn't really\nknow him, I stopped the chat in\nless than 2 min and left him sitting\non the sofa alone. After that I felt\nguilty, especially when my friend\ntold me that this guy is extremely\nshy and that it is impossible for\nhim to talk to a girl. Like a spy I\ntried to catch the moment when he\nworks, he smiles, etc. Now I think\nI am in love with him. How ironic!\nEvery time he walks past me, it\u2019s\nlike there\u2019s gold on the floor; he\nnever looks up. I tried to join his\nfriends circle, but no luck. I seriously cannot think of any other\nways. Help!\nShySassySillyGirl\nDear ShySassySillyGirl,\nAs much as I want to berate you\nfor you silliness I find myself in the\nawkward position of complete and\nutter sympathy. We have all been\nthere, but first things first you need\nto get over this. Ok, you made a\nmistake, some random guy came\nup to you and you cut him down. So\nwhat? Who wouldn\u2019t? Do you only\nlike him because you think that\nhe likes you? The problem there\nthough is how do you know whether\nhe still likes you? You need to break\nthe ice, become his friend first. Act\nas thought you don\u2019t really fancy\nhim. Sit next to him in the computer room, pretend you\u2019re computer\nleper and need help. Subtlety is the\nkey here. Try tripping him up, and\nthen whilst apologising, confess\nall. Or next time you go out club-bing, dance around him topless. I\nmean come on, if that doesn\u2019t get\nhis attention what will? If all else\nfails I suggest you just go and talk\nto him, something he probably won\u2019t\nexpect. Don\u2019t forget: honesty is the\nbest policy.\nHead on?\nTo Miss C,\nI'm not complaining, but my new\ngirlfriend loves giving me head.\nShe cannot get enough of it. Now,\nI really can't claim to have much\nexperience in these matters, and I\ndon't think it's bad in any way, but\nI've certainly never come across\nthis before. Is this normal?! Do\nmost girls enjoy it quite as much\nas she does?! I have no problem\nreturning the favour but I definitely\ndon't take quite as much pleasure\nfrom it as she does.\nMr. Grateful\nDear Mr. Grateful,\nNow why do I have the feeling that\nyou\u2019re sitting in the JCR surrounded by your group of bloke mates\nwho are praising you and worshipping the ground that you walk on?\nTalk about gratuitous praise. If your\ngirlfriend enjoys giving you head so\nmuch, why are you questioning it?\nEver heard of tempting fate a bit\ntoo much? Don\u2019t forget women are\npretty good at acting, and you\u2019re\nprobably not great at seeing right\nthrough her faking! Hint: this might\nnot be all that she\u2019s faking, ever\nseen When Harry met Sally? If I\nwere you I\u2019d stop analysing the situation and enjoy it while you can.\nLike you said, you\u2019ve never come\nacross this before and you\u2019ll probably never come across it again!\nDear Miss Confidentiality...\nHey guys, I\u2019m about, and as helpful as ever.

Whilst the West largely\nignored the conflict, refusing to acknowledge\nit as genocide, Paul Rusesabagina turned the\nprestigious Hotel des Mille Collines into an\nimpromptu refugee camp. In his new autobiog-raphy, An Ordinary Man, he tells the story of\nhow he saved the lives of 1,268 Tutsi and moderate Hutus.\nThroughout those three months Paul insists\nthat he did \u201cnothing special, I managed the\nhotel like I would every other day\u201d but, to the\npeople in his care his actions were nothing\nshort of extraordinary. Through his bravery and\nselflessness they escaped the rape and slaughter that besieged the streets as soldiers and\nthe government armed Interahamwe militia\nsystematically hunted down the Tutsi 'inyenzi'\n(cockroaches).\nIt is difficult to imagine how he managed to\nsave his own life, let alone those of 1,268 oth-ers, when by rights he should have been on the\ngovernment\u2019s hit-list. Though a Hutu himself,\nhis wife is a Tutsi and as such his children are of\nmixed-race, making him a target. He was also a\nknown dissident who often rebelled against the\ngovernment, refusing to wear badges expressing devotion to the Hutu President and hosting\nthe Tutsi rebel army, the RPF.\nAlthough no other moderate Hutu would have\nbeen tolerated by the regime, Rusesabagina\nwas able to charm and cajole many of the militants and officials. Using a black binder full of\nthe names of Rwanda's movers and shakers -collected during his years of service in the Mille\nCollines' sister hotel the Hotel Diplomates - he\ntraded in those favours for lives.\nHe applied his amazing ability to read people\nmethodically: first, flattery, by implying that\nofficials were \u2018too important to be dealing with\nthis\u2019, second an appeal to their wallet, and failing that, he would play on their fear of doubt\n- \u2018what if the Hutus lose the battle, and you are\nup against the Court of Human Rights, what\nwill you tell them? If you help us I will be able\nto defend you.\u2019\nIronically, the only people who failed to succumb to Rusesabagina charm and persuasion\nwere Western governments. When the hotel\nphones were cut off in April 1994, his black binder and the influential contacts it contained were\nuseless, removing the last lifeline. However, the\never-ingenious Paul saw round this problem by\nusing the fax machine (which had a direct line\nto the national grid). He stayed up late every\nnight firing off faxes to the Belgian Foreign\nMinistry, the White House, and the United\nNations - whoever might listen. One night he\nfollowed up on a fax to the White House only to\nbe told that he \u201cshould contact the embassy of\nthe United States in Rwanda\u201d. He informed the\nWhite House that their embassy left Rwanda on\nthe 9th of April.\nDespite, minimal help from both the UN and\nthe US, Rusesabagina was able to keep the\nrefugees alive until they could be transported to\nrefugee camps around the country. Soon afterwards the RPF took power, forming a Tutsi-only\ngovernment.\nTwo years later after his family were granted\nasylum in Belgium he left Rwanda as a refugee.\nWith little more than a briefcase Paul was able\nto support himself as a Taxi driver. Being a\nnatural businessman he expanded this into a\nminicab firm, and has now started a trucking\ncompany in Tanzania.\nPaul\u2019s story became widely known with the\nrelease of Hotel Rwanda, where he is played\nby Don Cheadle, who Paul says is \u201cmuch better looking\u201d. Following the release of the film\nhe was invited to the White House to meet\nPresident George Bush. When asked about the\nmeeting, in which they discussed the situation\nin Africa, he simply laughed. He holds a lot of\nresentment toward the United States for its\nfailure to intervene or even address the atrocity\nby its proper name - genocide.\nFully aware that the International Genocide\nTreaty would force them to act if they labelled\nthe conflict as genocide, the US stated only that\n\u201cacts of genocide had occurred\u201d, but there was\nnot sufficient evidence to suggest that the acts\nwere targeted at eliminating a specific group.\nSubsequently President Clinton has apologised to the Rwandan people and publicly stated\nthat not intervening in Rwanda was one of the\nbiggest regrets of his administration. Paul told\nFelix, \u201cHe [Clinton] apologised; that is ok, but it\nwould have been better if he had joined words\nwith actions. Those were just words.\u201d\nIt is widely acknowledged that the world at\nlarge made a dreadful mistake by not intervening earlier. A meagre 2,500 United Nations\nPeace Keeping troops were sent to Rwanda\nprior to the genocide but with a pitiful mandate.\nThey were prevented from using their weapons\nexcept in self\u2013defence, and were powerless to\nintervene even when people were being slaughtered directly in front of them.\nRusesabagina heavily criticises General\nRomeo Dallaire, commander of UN forces in\nRwanda, and the UN in general, stating that its\npresence was \u201cworse than useless\u201d, and was\nonly there to appease the world\u2019s conscience.\nEarly on in the genocide, Dallaire submitted a\nproposal to the Security Council for 5,000 well-equipped soldiers. His request was refused. A\nlater investigation revealed that this force would\nhave, at the very least, reduced the slaughter.\nDallaire tried in vain to force the genocide into\nthe forefront of the Security Council\u2019s mind,\ngiving interviews to every major media organi-sation, in which he appealed for more troops\nand a revised mandate. However, Rusesabagina\nbelieves that this was inadequate and Dallaire\n\u201cshould have disobeyed the foolish orders from\nNew York... or if he did not have the stomach\nto do this then I think he should have made a\nspectacle out of resigning.\u201d\nThe timing of the genocide could not have\nbeen worse for the victims. The slaughter began\nin April 1994 just months after the failed operation in Somalia of Black Hawk Down fame,\nwhich left the West extremely reluctant to send\nany more troops to Africa. On the first day of the\ngenocide the militia slaughtered ten Belgian\npeace-keepers to further discourage any intervention by the UN. As a result, Belgium, backed\nby the UK and the US, withdrew its troops, leaving just 260 poorly equipped soldiers, all from\nthe developing world.\nPaul remains critical of the UN's peacekeeping record. He says that in most cases the\n\u2018men on the ground\u2019 are from poorer countries,\nwhose governments are using the UN \u201cas just\na means to an end to improve their 'premium'\nwith the superpowers\u201d and that \u201cthe business\nof peace-keeping is now more of a joke, as\nsuperpowers are no longer involved.\u201d\nIn Rusesabagina\u2019s view the UN\u2019s failure in\nRwanda is just one of the events that has left\nthe UN in its current state of impotence. The\nUN was forged for all the right reasons in the\naftermath of the Second World War, to be an\ninternational body for peace, but Rusesabagina\nbelieves that its very inclusiveness is the one\nthing preventing it from being an effective body.\n\u201cThe UN can\u2019t decide unless they decide by con-sensus. Each and every one of the 150 members\nmust have their say but by then the genocide\nwould have been over.\u201d\nRusesabagina told me that \u201c\u2018never\u2019 and\n\u2018again\u2019 are the two most abused words in the\nworld today\u201d. When President Clinton used\nthose words in an inauguration speech at the\nHolocaust memorial in Washington in 1993\nthere was another genocide taking place on the\nother side of the world.\nThough officially there are no longer distinctions made between Hutus and Tutsis - everyone is simply Rwandan - Rusesabagina told\nme this is just a fa\u00e7ade to keep the West happy.\n\u201cTelling someone \u2018you are not a Hutu\u2019 and the\nother \u2018you are not a Tutsi\u2019 is just like telling\nyou \u2018you\u2019re not white\u2019 and me \u2018I\u2019m not black\u2019.\u201d\nRusesabagina believes that the hatred is so\ningrained that fresh bloodshed in the future is\nnot unimaginable. He says that although there\nis now a multiracial government, with Hutus in\npositions of authority, these roles are largely\njust symbolic, with no effective powers.\nIn the eyes of the Western world the new\nRwandan government is a model of African\ndemocracy, but according to Rusesabagina all\nis not as it seems, as the government operates\nthrough intimidation. Paul explained, \u201cWhen\nthey see the Tutsi survivors they tell them,\n\u2018listen you guys. Your Hutu neighbours were\ngoing to kill you. It was us, the RPF, who saved\nyour lives. Shut up.\u2019 They also come to Hutus\nand tell them \u2018we will kill you anytime we want,\nif it wasn\u2019t for us you wouldn\u2019t be here\u2019. Those\nHutus also shut up.\u201d The Rwandan government\u2019s intimidation does not stop with its own\ncitizens. \u201cWhenever the international community raises a voice the government says \u2018listen\nyou guys. You ignored the fact that there was\na genocide. Don\u2019t give us a lesson. You\u2019ve got\nnothing to teach us\u2019 and the international community just shuts up.\u201d\nWestern nations have tried to press Rwanda\ninto dealing more effectively with the 120,000\ngenocide suspects held in prison, more than\n50% of whom are being held without charge.\nHe told me \u201cit is worse than Guantanamo Bay,\nbecause in Rwanda with the husband in jail the\nwife and children are also in prison\u201d as the wife\nhas to bring the husband\u2019s food to the prison at\n10am every day, preventing her from working.\nThough the legal system is overwhelmed by\nan immense workload, this is not a sufficient\nexcuse for its lack of effectiveness, as Paul\nexplained: \u201cafter the genocide the whole world\nfelt guilty. They said \u2018now we are going to help\nRwanda to rebuild\u2019. They raised $1.2bn. They\nstarted training judges, but those judges never\nwent to courts.\u201d\nInstead of a more formal justice system,\nRwanda has favoured a form of community\njustice called Gaccaca courts, where the local\npeople come together to try and to convict their\npeers. Rusesabagina strongly disagrees with\nthe Gacacca system because \u201ceveryone knows\nthat in the Gaccaca courts those peasant people\nwill be trying and convicting their neighbours.\nThey can convict you to 30 years imprisonment\nor even life. Is that power really to be given to\npeople of such a lower level?\u201d\nPaul is extremely worried about the situation within not just Rwanda but also Africa as\na whole. According to Rusesabagina, the whole\nof Africa is just a \u201cforgotten continent\u201d. He\nreels of a list of other forgotten African horrors:\nUganda, Darfur, Ivory Coast, Somalia. \u201cAfrica\nseems to be very far away from America and\nEurope. Those are the deciders?\u201d He believes\nthat the status quo can be changed but \u201cwhat\nwe need now is to send a strong message to all\nof those dictators who kill their own people, who\nsteal from their own countries. Listen you guys,\nyou are not untouchable, one day you will also\nface justice.\u201d\nToday, we shudder at the astounding rapidity\nwith which the massacres took place. Averaged\nout, 8000 people died each day, meaning more\nthan 5 lives were taken each minute. Paul\nRusesabagina, whose names mean, fittingly,\n\u2018the great communicator\u2019 and \u2018warrior who\ndisperses enemies\u2019 managed to save 4 hours\nworth of people. His autobiography is a tale of\ncourage and human resilience, yet he himself\nis a modest and simple man, who insists that he\ndid nothing extraordinary. He is a modern day\nhero, and an inspiration to all.\nAn Ordinary Man is published by Bloomsbury\nand priced at \u00a316.99 (hardback).\nRupert Neate & Saba Shafi\nNo Ordinary\nNo Ordinary\nMan\nMan\nThe hero of Hotel Rwanda, Paul Rusesabagina, launches a\ndamning critique of the United Nations and the Rwandan\ngovernment, telling Rupert Neate why the world needs to\ntake notice of Africa, the \u201cforgotten continent\u201d\n\n"

Sentencing will occur on 11th\nSeptember.Prosecutorswererelieved\nby the verdict despite a lengthy list of\nemployees and investors who were\ncertain that the two chief executive\nwere to blame. Until Thursday\u2019s rul-ing, no Enron executive had been\nconvicted of any crimes.\nAfter the verdicts were read out, Mr\nLay\u2019s wife and children sobbed while\nhuddling around him. Mr Skilling\u2019s\nwife did not attend the hearing and\nboth men vowed to vigorously appeal.\nThe largest scandal in American corporate history concluded on Thursday\n25th May. A climax was reached with\nformer Enron bosses Kenneth Lay\nand Jeff Skilling convicted for conspiracy and fraud. This came as a\nrelief to prosecutors and the govern-ment, who have been cracking down\nhard on white-collar crime over the\npast five years. These crimes have\nshattered investor confidence, resulted in job losses and have cost the US\neconomy billions of dollars.\nThe notorious case lasted sixteen\nweeks in court, but took only six days\nto deliberate. The jury concluded that\nMr Lay and Mr Skilling had deceived\ncompany-shareholders regarding\nthe true state of the energy-trading\nfirm. The conviction was not easy\nto secure, though, and of the thirty\npeople charged in connection with\nthe scandal, prosecutors had to make\ndeals with over half of them.\nSome of the jurors viewed themselves as key players in the fight\nagainst corporate irresponsibility and\ngreed that prompted US lawmakers\nto pass the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The\nnew laws have increased the extent\nto which executive and directors are\naccountable for company actions. At\na news conference, Kath Harrison\n\u2013 one of the jurors \u2013 said, \u201cThis is\nundoubtedly the most challenging\nand heart rendering experience I\u2019ve\never had, I\u2019ve fought a battle ground\nfor American justice.\u201d\nMr Skilling was found guilty on\neighteen counts of conspiracy and\nfraud but was acquitted from all\nbut one \u2013 insider trading.

For\nEnron fraudsters found guilty\nOverview of week\u2019s business news\nMichael Olymbios\nBusiness Editor\nThe jurors rejected the two\u2019s defence,\nwhich was different from ordinary\ncorporate strategies. Usually, executives accept that fraudulent actions\nhave taken place but deny personal\nresponsibility.\nIn this case, however, it would be\ndifficult to prove that the such large\nfraudulent transactions could have\ngone unnoticed by the chief execu-tive. Instead, the former executives\nclaimed that the company had been\ndestroyed by a market panic brought\non by heightened scrutiny of the\nmedia, regulators and analysts. They\nGlobal equity markets endured another tough week. Shares in London\nand Central Europe were highly\nvolatile. Emerging market equities\nin Russia, India and Indonesia fell\nsharply. Investors ploughed money\ninto US treasuries, which strengthened over the week. Fears over inflation are blamed and were heightened\nlast week with a rise in durable good\nordered and the Federal Open Market\nCommittee signaling that interest\nrates in the US will rise.\nEnergy was at the top of the agenda\nin a Russian-EU summit that took\nplace in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\nRussian President Putin attempted\nto ease European fears over unstable\nenergy sources stating Russia, \u201cwas,\nis and always will be\u201d a reliable supplier to the EU.\nOECD is upbeat on the outlook\nof the global economy. Despite the\ncurrent turmoil in equity markets,\nweakening dollar, inflation issues and\nspiking commodity prices, the Parisbased economic think-tank said that\nthe world\u2019s leading economies are\nlooking strong in the next quarter.\nEuronext, the company that runs\nEuropean stock exchanges and the\nalso claimed that their activities were\nnot abnormal for tech boom companies and if any creative accounting\ndid go on, it was no different from the\nmoney-shuffling policies of similar\nfirms. One of Mr Lay\u2019s lawyers even\nremarked, \u201cwhen did bankruptcy\nbecome a crime?\u201d\nMr Skilling was granted a bond of\n$5 million until sentencing but was\nordered to surrendered his passport\nand have his five children put forward\ntheir homes to guarantee the bond. In\nthe meantime, various hedge funds\nand other investment funds have\nagreed to buy Enron\u2019s remaining $2.1\nbillion assets.\nProsecutors hope that this verdict\nwill satisfy the American people who\nview Enron as the symbol of those\nwho have amassed fortunes through\ndubious means. The trial did help\nemphasise some home truths regarding American business culture, particularly with regards to spin. Mr\nLay was a great fan of spin and this\nis, of course, sometimes necessary\nfor marketing within any company.\nProblem arose when Mr Lay took\nspin to the point of criminal lying.\nHe lied about company earning, not\nonly to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, but also to employees\nwho were told Enron was \u201cgoing to\nhit [its] numbers\u201d when it clearly\nwas not.\nThe draconian measures of\nSarbanes-Oxley, seeking to put an\nend to corporate fraud and bolster\ninvestor sentiment might, in the end,\ndo more harm than good to the capital\nmarket of the US. Initial public offerings that would have normally ended\nup in New York might now gravitate\ntowards London and other financial\ncentres with less stringent rules.

The morale is\nplummeting.\n\u201cWe used to be part of the Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine (ICSM)\nbut were moved into the Faculty of\nLife Sciences. There was a \u00a31.7 million deficit and the ICSM would not\npay for teaching; who are they intending to get to do it in the future?\u201d\nSir Peter Knight, Faculty Principal,\npreviously told staff that the financial state of the BMS division was\nunsustainable and their position was\nuntenable. Deficits of over \u00a3507,000\nwere recorded for the financial\nyear 2005/2006 and projections for\n2006/2007 show a deficit of over \u00a31.4\nmillion on a turnover of \u00a31.6 million.\nFelix took these points to a College\nspokesman, who responded: \u201cThe\nCollege\u2019s duty is to strengthen and\nCollege security flaws\nSecurity at the Faculty Building, hub\nof College academic management\nand workplace of the Rector, has been\nexposed as inadequate and ineffective in light of a Felix investigation.\nFelix reporters were able to enter\nthe \u2018restricted\u2019 building on two separate occasions and were not challenged over their identity, whether\nthey were in fact members of\nCollege or their purpose for entering\nImperial\u2019s administrative headquar-ters.\nEntry to the building is usually controlled by swipe card entry gates\nthat allow access to a select group\nof College staff; these are adjacent\nto a manned security desk at the\nentrance of the modern four-storey\nbuilding and are the main access\npoints for all personnel entering and\nleaving the Faculty building.\nReporters were waved past the\ndesk on entry and left to roam freely\naround the floors coming within feet\nof Sir Richard\u2019s office and mixing\nwith employees at a nearby coffee\nbar.\nEmpty offices with thousands of\npounds worth of equipment and\nconfidential documents were all in\npotential reach of the reporters.\nAfter spending over 30 minutes in the\nbuilding, Felix left and returned an\nhour later to be greeted by a different\nChris Miles & Vitali Lazurenko receptionist who also granted access\nwithout confirmation of prior appointments or identity.\nSimon Davies, a first year physicist,\ntold Felix: \u201cIf College can\u2019t keep the\nRector secure, what hope is there for\nthe student body?\u201d\nSamantha Perera, a second year\nmedical student, said: \u201cPersonally I\nthink far too much money is spent\non security as Imperial College and\nthe Rector are not high-risk terrorist\ntargets. The money could be better\nspent on improving teaching facilities.\u201d\nConcerned with such lapses in\nCollege security, Felix also attempted\nto gain access to restricted areas in\nthe Sir Alexander Fleming Building\n(SAF) and Union offices. Once inside\nthe SAF, we were able to tailgate a\nresearcher into a restricted access\narea without being challenged. We\nsubsequently had open access to\nresearch labs, some of which contained hazardous chemicals, as well\nas expensive microscopy equipment.\nSimilar breaches occurred in the\nSabbatical offices, where no attention was paid as reporters passed\nthe Union reception and into the\nunlocked vacant office of Deputy\nPresident (Education and Welfare)\nSarah Khatib. Various valuables were\nleft unattended in the room, in direct\ncontravention to advice issued at the\nContinued, page 3\nThe Biomedical Sciences division, located at the heart of Imperial\u2019s Sir Alexander Fleming Building.

With\nsets spanning from the pounding beats of the likes of Eddie\nHalliwell, Mixmag's two time\ncrowned \u201cWorld Number One\nDj\u201d. To the Turntablist sounds\nof the Scratch Perverts mixing\nit up in the Urban Arena, right\nthrough to downright dirty Drum\nn Bass, with a Dj set from Planet\nPendulum, followed by Radio\nOne's Fabio and Grooverider in\nthe Raveology Arena, to keep\nyou buzzing hard into the night.\nRadio One will be joining the evenings delights on their own stage,\nboasting the Netherlands Armin\nVan Buuren. He is sure to be\none of my personal highlights of\nthe night, ranked at no. 3 in the\npublic-voted DJ Top 100, he is one\nof the leading lights in the genre\nand the atmosphere is sure to be\nalive and electric, guaranteed to\nput you into a State of Trance.\nSimply unmissable.\nNow for a little peek at the main\nstage, which is throwing out a\nwhole host of stars over the day.\nHeadlining will be Wales very\nown track-suit clad super stars,\nwho need absolutely no introduc-ing. Yes, Goldie Lookin' Chain,\nwill be entertaining us all in their\noh so unique style. I've seen them\na few times before and they get\nbetter everytime, here's what\nthey have to say;\n\u201cThis summer will see the second coming of love. We\u2019re more\nthan overjoyed to be appearing\nat this year\u2019s Escape in the Park\nevent. Not only for the amazing women and tearing party\natmosphere, but because we get\nto party in Wales and also get\nto stay at the Pantycelyn guesthouse on Oyster Mouth road. We\nalso want to see sixty thousand\nravers on the beach at 5am, just\nlike Ibiza, but with better pubs.\u201d\nA brief recap, yes there will be\n\u201camazing women\u201d a \u201ctearing\nparty atmosphere\u201d, and world\nclass acts for 12 jam packed\nhours. How can you not come\nnow?\nAlso on the Main stage, yet\nfrom slightly further afield than\nNewport (Washington DC in\nfact), the incredible, Grammy\nwinning Iranian-American House\nduo Deep Dish will be leading\nup to Goldie Lookin' Chain. A\nmash up of various genres into\ntheir very own deep house sound,\nmakes Deep Dish stand out in the\ncrowd as an original and hugely\npopular act. They've gone from\nstrength to strength since their\namazing debut album in 1998, a\ndefinite one to see.\nAs well as the non-stop music\nthere will be other attractions\nthroughout the day, notably a\nselection of white-knuckle thrill\nrides, dazzling displays, dancers\nand Karaoke if you feel the urge\nand/or are really drunk.\nHaving only mentioned a few of\nthe world class artists performing (and very briefly at that) I feel\nguilty for leaving this preview of\nwhat is going to be a truly class\nA, 12 hours of musical madness\nhere. All I can do is urge you to\nenter the competition, win the\ntickets and rock on down and\njoin the party, what better way is\nthere to end the exam season?\nEmail in to nightlife telling me why you\nshould win two tickets to Escape. Then\nyou might !\n.\nConsidering I have exams tomor-row, I\u2019ve decided to spend the time\nI have left for revision making a\ntwo page spread for Felix. Oh well.\nThis week we\u2019ve got a super special competition giveaway for two\ntickets to the biggest dance music\nfestival in the UK, Escape Into The\nPark in Swansea, the line-up looks\npretty good, so good in fact that\nI may go there myself (purely for\njournalistic purposes) and check\nit out. Simon has kindly written us\na preview on the event and after\nhours of research has created the\nmasterpiece you can see to the\nleft.\nIn other matters, Conor has written us another review. Don\u2019t you\nhave a job or work or something?\nThis time its of sometng a little\nmore suited to student budgets,\nthe Notting Hill Arts Club on a\nNorwegian invasion night, good\nEnd of term is fast approaching, no more work?\nWe\u2019re all doomed!\nstuff as usual and great outfits, as\nexpected.\nFinally, the lovely Alex has been\nkind enough to document our night\nout to Plastic People to check out\nwhat replaced And Did We Mention\nOur Disco. All I can say is that the\nnew club night Lost was absolutely\nawful, and possibly ranks as one\nof the worst nights I\u2019ve ever had\nthe misfortune to visit. Good work\nPlastic People in replacing a sellout club night with something that\nattracted about 15 people.\nRemember to enter the competition this week to win tickets for\nEscape Into The Park, if nobody\ndoes, well you can guess who will\nget the free tickets. Yep, my mum.\nNext week the competition will be\ntickets to Get Loaded In The Park.\nYou should definately enter for\nthose tickets, its in London so you\nwon\u2019t even have to move very far\nfrom college, which I assume you\nwill all be hanging about during the\nholidays, considering how amazing\nit is here (I will be).\nFor upcoming reviews, a brave\nreviewer has volenteered to visit 5\nclubs in 5 concecutive nights. I will\nonly attatch one rule to that, minimum 20 alcohol units per night.\nWe\u2019re also still looking for more\nvolenteers, so I\u2019ll use the rest of\nthe space in my column to try to\nconvince you to write things for us.\nPlease write for us, or Conor and\nMichael will invade the whole of\nFelix! (Not that I would mind). I\u2019m\nnot sure I understand why I all-ways hear complaints from people\ntelling me how expensive the union\nis for drinks, when I offer them free\ndrinks they refuse!\nGreg Mead\nNightlife Editor\nThink you can write reviews ?\nFelix Nightlife is looking for reviewers\nto check out nightclubs, bars and other\nspecial events throughout London.\nIf you want free entry and drinks, email\nin with any ideas.\nUpcoming festivals\nGet Loaded In The Park\nThis year will see the second incarnation of the Clapham\nCommon festival, boasting a line-up that most major festivals would be jealous of.

I have\na number of points that I want to\nmake about the system and the food\nthemselves.\n1. The Cost \u2013 The the chicken\nskewers cost \u00a32 which is quite\nexpensive under any circumstance\nhowever especially when they are\ncompared with the \u00a31.76 baguettes\noffered by the Tiki Caf\u00e9.\n2. When I actually purchased the\nfood they got stuck in the machine\nand to enable them to be removed\nthe box was squashed beyond repair.\nThis is not an irregular occurrence\nas I have seen on a number of occasions the same thing happening with\nthe machines.\n3. I then chose to have them\nheated. Following the instructions I\nplaced them in the microwave and\npressed start. Indeed a quick 30\nseconds later I removed the food.\nThis was where the real problems\nstarted.\na. The box had started too disinte-grated.\nb. Then I opened the box and to\nmy dismay I found 3 \u201ctiny\u201d pieces\nof chicken. The combined weight\nof which could not have been more\nthen the weight of the money I paid\nStar\nLetter\nBiomedical\nSciences closures\nFelix and, more importantly, the staff\nconcerned remain totally unware\nwhat the future holds for Biomedical\nSciences at Imperial.\nWhen we asked College to provide\nus with full details of the planned\nclosures and job cuts, we were only\ntold that College \u201care protecting\nthe teaching\u2026students and facilities will not be affected\u201d. There was\nno mention as to the job security of\nthose employed in the BMS division.\nFelix is the students\u2019 newspaper, but\nit is read by most staff members at\nImperial.\nWe understand the staff will be\ninformed of the decision today. Felix\nhopes that College has the sense to\ntreat its employees with the respect\nthey deserve.\n11\nfelix\nThursday 1 June 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nLax security in\nCollege, again\nDespite College focusing heavily on security concerns, notably\nOctober\u2019s dress code, this is the\nthird lapse in security Felix has\nuncovered this year.\nOn most occasions we gained\naccess to forbidden areas by simply\ntailgaiting others through resticted\ndoors. Staff and students need to\nbe aware of those around them and\nnot hold doors open for people they\ndon\u2019t know.\nEven though we may not have\naccessed any highly classified\nareas, it still brings into question\nthe security of this campus. Given\na bit more time and effort, we are\nsure we could have gained access\nto even more restricted areas.\nfor them.\nc. The appearance of the chicken\nwas nothing that would inspire you\nto eat it - in fact it wouldn\u2019t be wrong\nto say that it was just revolting.\nd. Then to top it all the food wasn\u2019t\neven what could be considered\nremotely warm.\ne. When I actually tried some of\nthe chicken it was horrible and had\nno flavour, the best part was the\nsauce provided.\nI tried this food to see what I\nthought I would be eating come\nexam time as it has been tipped as\nbeing the food available 24 hours a\nday during the exams. If I had an\nexam any time soon I would have\nbeen very hesitant to even think\nabout eating it due to any possible\nmedical repercussions. I do think\nthat the idea was good however I\njust feel that the action undertaken\nwas very poor and something needs\nto be done.\nEdward Judge\nPlease & thank you go a\nlong way\nDear Felix,\nForgive me for being a nag but I just\nfind it amazing and unbelieveable how\nrude people can be when they don't\nsay \"please\" or \"thank you\". I found\nthis quite a trend when I was helping out with Medical OSCE exams\nrecently, where not one even said\n\"please\" or \"thank you\" to the helper\nwho was going to hand them the needles and gloves. Furthermore, when\nlending pens, I find them handed\nback to me without a word of appre-ciation. I am quite compelled to stop\nbeing generous when I don't hear a\nhe author of the Star Letter received each week wins \u00a310\nWe want to hear your views\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nword of please.\nYou'll find it quite amazing how a\nlittle appreciation for our fellow students can go a long way and make\neveryone's day so much better, considering its rarity nowadays.\nyours,\nAva\n1st Year Medical Student\nPublic transport horror\nDear Felix,\nWhy is public transport so bad? My\nparents live in a hilly little place not\nso far from Manchester. Ordinarily\nI would get the wonderful Virgin\npendolino train from Euston (which\nmakes me feel less bad about the\nprice of the ticket), but the main\nline was closed this weekend, to my\ndismay. The National Rail website\ntold me to get a train to Nottingham\n(or Sheffield) from St. Pancras. This\ndoubled my journey time from a\nbearable 2 hours to more than 4.\nThe last step of the journey\ninvolved me using (gasp) a bus.\nGrowing up in Saddleworth has prepared me well for the terrible bus\nservice, but it has since worsened. It\ntakes another two hours to travel the\n12 miles from Manchester, and these\nbuses run just once an hour.\nReturning to London always\nmakes me think how much better things are here, and it amazes\nme that the government (initially)\nrefused funding for Manchester\u2019s\nMetrolink. I wonder whether the\npeople sitting in Westminster\nknow what lies beyond the limits of\nGreater London.\nDaniel\nThis is the\nthird lapse in\nsecurity Felix\nhas uncovered\nthis year\n\u201c\n\u201d\nOnly a pair of issues left!\nMake your point while you still can. Only 2 issues left.\n\n"

The dons have been careful\nnot to enter into the perennial access\ndebate which surrounds the university application process, insisting that\nthe study makes \u201cno comment on the\nintrinsic value of different institutions\nand courses\u201d. Dr Brundin, reader\nin engineering at Oxford, is quick\nto point out that their paper is not a\ndenunciation of the funding council\u2019s\n2003 paper and must not be taken as\nproof across the board: \u201cWe\u2019re saying we can\u2019t challenge their study\nas a whole, but that we cannot say\nit applies to a single institution and\nin particular, it does not apply to\nOxbridge.\u201d\nHowever, the study has received\nsome criticism. John Thompson,\nan analyst for the funding council,\nclaims that the present study fails\nto \u201cfully appreciate\u201d their original\nresearch and maintains that \u201coverall,\nif you make a comparison, keeping\neverything the same, state school\nstudents do a little better\u201d. Although,\nThompson does admit that at the\nmost selective universities the effect\nof a student\u2019s background on their\nfinal classification is less apparent.\nThe publication of the funding\ncouncil\u2019s initial report met with\nmixed reactions upon publication.\nMany supported a system in which\nan applicant\u2019s results were judged\nin the context in which they were\nachieved, but some labelled the move\nnothing more than social discrimi-nation, albeit of a positive nature.\nWhether this latest study will herald the return to a system where\nstudents are measured entirely on\nacademic ability remains to be seen,\nbut as its authors acknowledge this is\n\u201csurely a boost for the use of A-level\nin the admissions exercise\u201d.\nCannabis effective in\ntreatment of post-op pain\nA study at Imperial College has shown\ncannabis to be effective at relieving\npost-operative pain.\nThe trial, carried out by researchers based at Imperial and led by Dr\nAnita Holdcroft, showed that administering Cannador (an extract of the\ncannabis plant) can be beneficial to\npatients suffering from acute pain\nfollowing surgery.\nWhilst this is not the first study\ninto the use of cannabinoids in cases\nof acute pain, it follows widespread\nresearch into the effect of Cannabis\nin various types of pain: mainly into\nchronic pain relief, such as multiple\nschlerosis (MS).\nPatientsathospitalsalloverLondon\n(including Chelsea & Westminster\nand Charing Cross) were given\nCannador in a single pill dose of 5,\n10, or 15mg immediately following\nan operation. The test subjects with\nlarger doses reported a decrease in\npain and an increase in side effects\n(such as nausea and an increased\nheart rate). All patients receiving a\n5mg dose requested additional pain\nrelief. However, only half of patients\nreceiving the 10mg requested additional medication; and of patients\ngiven 15mg, three-quarters required\nno additional pain relief whatsoever.\nThe extract targets the brain\u2019s natural cannabinoid system to relieve\npain, in similar way to morphine\nmimicking the opiates that naturally\noccur in the body. When compared\nto morphine (the conventional treatment for acute pain), the major side\neffects are less dangerous and the\ndrug is far safer. Cannabis is most\nnotorious for its recreational use, but\nthis involves taking a huge overdose\nof the substance, whereas in the levels prescribed it has a far more beneficial effect.\nFollowing successful human trials\nand a \u201cmountain\u201d of animal trial data,\nthere are clear benefits and uses for\ncannabis-based treatments. The lead\nresearcher, Dr Anita Holdcroft, said\nthat this approach has the \u201cpotential\nto become part of normal post-opera-tive care\u201d.\nHowever, licensed Cannabinoid\ndrugs aren\u2019t likely to be available for\nmany years, if ever. A special Home\nOffice licence is required to carry out\ntrials of this nature, and cannabis is\nstill an illegal substance.\nAs Dr Holdcroft states: \u201cThey\u2019re\nfocussing on MS even though it\u2019s\nproven to work on acute pain.\u201d This\nis mainly due to the few available\ntreatments that provide pain-relief\nfor MS, whereas there are several\nother medications which treat acute\npain, and not enough money to make\nits benefits available for acute suf-ferers.\nAndrew Somerville\nContinued from page 1\nstart of term in light of recent hall\nthefts to make sure students keep\ntheir property secure and doors\nlocked.\nCollege told Felix: \u201cIt is vital that\nmembers of the College community\ndo not allow people to tailgate when\nthey enter a building, make sure doors\nare properly closed behind them and\nreport any suspicious behaviour to\nsecurity staff.\u201d\nResponding to the Felix investigators entering the heart of Imperial\nmanagement, College responded:\n\u201cThey were not challenged because\nthey were known members of the\nCollege community and assumed to\nbe there on legitimate business.\u201d\nHowever, no such connections\nwere made when Felix was admitted on two separate occasions by\nreceptionists to the building, believing the reporters were not students\nand had prearranged appointments\nwith members of the Faculty Building\nmanagement staff.\nCollege added: \u201cIt is important that\nstaff and students should not confront\nanyone they believe to be acting sus-piciously, but should contact security\nstaff or the police immediately.\u201d\nLeader, page 11\nCollege\u2019s sloppy security exposed\nDo state school pupils really outshine independent students at university?\nThe widespread belief that state-edu-cated pupils will outperform their\nprivately educated contemporaries at\nuniversity has been challenged this\nweek by Oxford academics.\nOver recent years admissions\ntutors at top universities have adopted a more lenient approach towards\nstate school applicants, under the\npremise that these candidates will\ngo on to achieve higher grades than\nthose from private schools.\nResearch published by the Higher\nEducation Funding Council for\nEngland in 2003 supported this claim\nwith evidence that, given equal Alevel scores, a higher proportion of\nstate-educated graduates achieved\na 2:1 degree compared to those from\nthe independent sector. Further studies by Smith and Naylor, readers in\nEconomics at Warwick University\nhave blamed the so-called \u2018independent school effect\u2019 which describes the\nobservable fact that independent candidates may seem more intelligent\nthan they are due to their school\u2019s\nability to pull everyone through with\nhigh A-levels.\nHowever, a new study conducted at Oxford University by Dr\nN.G. McCrum, Emeritus Fellow of\nHertford College, Dr C.L. Brundin\nand A.H. Halsey, Emeritus Professor\nof Social and Administrative Studies,\nhas found no evidence of this phenomenon within Oxford or Cambridge.\nAccording to their findings, Oxbridge\ncolleges should not make concessions\nfor comprehensive pupils, with the\nexception of males studying science.\nThe study compared the final\nscores of Oxford and Cambridge\ngraduates, from various academic\nbackgrounds, between 1976 and 2002.\nPupils with two A grades and one B\ngrade were compared with entrants\nwho had achieved three A grades at\nA-level.

    "content": "SPORT, CLUBS & SOCIETIES sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nfelix\nThursday 1 June 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nAfter a recent good run by IC 1sts\ntheir spirits were running high into\ntheir biggest match of the season.\nWith the recent dispatch of their\nprevious Stinky captain to foreign\nparts, Batty had been left in charge to\nensure the Medics got a good beating.\nAnd that he did with great success.\nWith earlier talks by Jezzer saying\nthat we were 'gonna beat them psy-chologically' he was obviously up for\nthe job. The psychology worked, leaving the Medics to attempt to warm up\nat the Fortress for hours beforehand.\nMeanwhile the Imperial 1sts had the\nsense to arrive at the pitch just as\nthe whistle was blown, avoiding the\nicy (IC) wind and barren conditions\nfor as long as possible. IC's Batty\ncaptain arrived just seconds before\npushback, having decided a casual\ndrive to Reading and back would be\nthe perfect warm up.\nA rousing call of \"1,2,3 Fortress\" in\nthe huddle obviously had the right\neffect, as despite having nine short\ncorners the 'scum' could only convert one, and soon ran out of ideas\nwhen they realised their fabled drag\nflicker could not put the ball past an\ninspired and often airborne Apu in\nthe IC goal. If only he hadn't been so\npolite, always inviting them to \"please\ncome again\" he may have been up\nfor the 'Best Visual Effects' award in\nHollywood next month. Even in open\nplay the pansies couldn't force their\nway through the brick wall that was\nthe IC Central defence of Date Rape\nand Mountie.\nConfusion and panic swept through\nthe IC ranks midway through the first\nhalf as Blue leader, Flight Lueitenant\nStar Wars appeared to desert his\ncomrades mid-battle. Little did we\nknow it was all a cunning strategy to\ncatch the opposition unaware, as Star\nWars light jumped his x-wing back\ninto the fray, lazers blazing triumphantly as the young padawan fired\nhome another IC goal.\nThe right wing attack combined\nHarvester with the slippery skills of\nToadfish. Although some tackles from\nHarvester were on the agricultural\nside, he ploughed down the flank and\nsowed the seeds for the IC forwards\nto reap the rewards.\nToadfish in the midfield took an ill-deserved and obscene ramming from\nhis ULU chums, but still seemed to\nbe having a whale of a time schooling the scum on how to drag-flick.\nPerhaps it was something Date Rape\nslipped into the oppo's half-time\ndrinks but he certainly managed to\ntake out a few of the ULU boys with\nhis rock-solid tackle throughout the\nsecond half. And we all thought he\nhad a girlfriend?!\nWith Crusty clowning around and\nPhlegm sticking it in yet another\nmedic, the IC attack quashed the\nscum resolve. Both snatched well\ntaken goals, though the actual intent\nof Phlegm's 15-yard loop-deflection\nmust be brought into question.\nCometh the shortie, cometh the\nDrag-Queen, but even Max had to\nstand and watch as Toadfish harpooned the ball into the medic goal,\nleaving the scum keeper flapping\naround like a fish out of water. In\nattempting to find his hat-trick and\ndeserved messy-pint, Toadfish decided the scum deserved a mid-match\ntaster course in open-heart surgery\nwhen he proceded to sling another\nvicious drag-flick into the chest of a\nmarauding medic defender, re-creat-ing a scene similar to the opening\nof Saving Private Ryan. The consequence was that the medic pulled his\nheart-string and the remnants of the\nmedic team followed suit soon after.\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s a good thing\nthey're all medics (if ever that can\nbe a good thing?), cos its gonna take\nsome serious surgery to repair the\nwounds inflicted on that fateful day at\nThe Fortress!\nOne medic scum summarised in\nconfidence to Stinky:\n\"The buggers won 5-2. We played\nlike chumps, converted 1/9 shorties\nand leaked like a sieve. Gay. Also\nLander drag-flicked 2 into the net\nand 1 into my chest.\" Yes Mr medic,\ngay indeed.\nVarsity victory\nMen\u2019s Hockey\nImperial College 1st XI 5\nICSM 1st XI 2\nJez Green\nUltimate Frisbee is a game played\nbetween two teams of seven play-ers, using one disc (more commonly\nknown as a frisbee). Each team tries\nto obtain, and then maintain, possession of the disc by passing it between\nteam-mates, so that they can score\nby catching the disc in the opponents\u2019\nendzone. It is a non-contact sport,\nand players cannot run with the disc.\nLast Saturday KCL and Imperial\u2019s\nUltimate Frisbee clubs joined forces\nto create the mixed team \u201cFlump\u201d,\nto compete at a national mixed tour-nament. 36 teams travelled from\nacross Britain to compete, and some\nof the best players in Europe were in\naction.\nBasic stands for \u201cBrunel and\nSouthampton in Conjuction\u201d \u2013 sorry\nto disappoint all you computer types,\nbut it\u2019s not the language sometimes\npreceded by \u201cVisual\u201d. They entered\ntwo teams into this tournament,\nand split their teams evenly. Both\nBrunel and Southampton have very\nstrong Uni teams, and they dominated the game from the beginning.\nTheir strong handlers were able to\nfire off a worrying number of dangerous break-force throws, and their\nzone defence was equally strong in\nthe wind. We succeeded in breaking through once, with impressive\ncutting by Liza for our first score.\nParticular comedy moments included\nthree pick calls (a type of obstruction\nfoul) by Basic\u2019s JJ in our endzone,\nand stinging horizontal hail stones\nthat sent substitutes sprinting for any\nshelter they could find.\nAfter a long break, and the arrival\nof \u201cMental\u201d Gaz, we played against\nEaling\u2019s ultimate team. The game\nwas characterised by \u201chuck-and-D\u201d\n(i.e. playing for yards, or simply huck-ing downwind and hoping the opposition turnover near their endzone).\nThey caught a slight early lead, but\na switch from zone-D to a straight-up force did the trick, and the game\nwas very close for a long time. Our\nlack of experience of playing together\nshowed through in the later stages,\nand the Herd managed to grab a couple of critical upwind points.\nWe went into this a bit too excited\nfrom the game before, and failed to\nadapt our style of play. The winds\nwere gradually getting stronger (as if\nthey weren\u2019t strong enough anway),\nhuck-and-D failed to work, and we\nturned the disc over too often close\nto our endzone. One highlight which\nhas to be mentioned was Amy\u2019s first\nlayout \u2013 she didn\u2019t managed to get\nthe disc, but it was a valiant effort\nfor someone who\u2019s been playing for\nless than two months, and who had\nnever played a proper match before.\nIt was the most excited I\u2019d seen Sam\nall weekend!\nAfter showering in the dodgiest\nshowers in London we headed off to\nthe \u201cDutch House\u201d pub for the tour\nparty. Only one other team showed-up, but the friendly staff, cheap food,\ncheap drink, good company, and comedy selection of late 80\u2019s and early\n90\u2019s cheese made-up for it. It turns\nout most teams decided to go home\nand watch Eurovision instead.\nFrisbee-tacular!\nFlump All-Stars\nManny Bennett\nUltimate Frisbee\nDiscuits 2 were the highest-seeded\nteam we\u2019d play all weekend so we\nknew it would be tough. Though their\nhandling wasn\u2019t special, they had a\ncouple of very fast receivers, and\ntook an early 6-0 lead. We had a mini-comeback which scared Discuits, but\nthey soon regained their composure,\nand put real pressure on our handlers\nwith their junk-zone-D. The game was\nslightly marred by Discuits\u2019 unsportsmanlike behaviour.\nWe started seeded 33 out of 36, and\nended 35. We didn\u2019t really mind the\nshocking weather, but we did mind\nmissing out on 2 more games because\na team pulled out at the last minute,\nand the UK Ultimate Association\ndecided it was more important for\nhigher seeded-team to have a full\nset of games than for lower teams to\nhave a full set of games, despite us all\npaying the same entry fee.\nBasic 2 vs Flump\n15 - 2\nABH \u2013 Flump\n12 \u2013 6\nHerd 2 vs Flump\n12 \u2013 8\nDiscuits 2 \u2013 Flump\n15 \u2013 5\nSanrizz Education Centre, 5 Cheval Place, London, SW7 1EW.\nHAIR MODELS REQUIRED\nSanrizz.

    "content": "SCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nfelix\nThursday 1 June 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nT\nhe difficult job of a professional science writer got that little bit easier with the launch, last week, of\nWriteSci.com, an internet service\ndesigned to aid the fraught process of turning hard science into\neasy reading. Angela D\u2019Angelo, the\nsite\u2019s founder: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to\nhelp those afflicted with linguistic impediment dis-order, or Writer\u2019s Block, by providing a number of\nautomated tools to help them translate cutting-edge\nscience for the lay reader.\u201d\nThe most exciting tool on WriteSci.com is the\nProminent Scientist Quote Generator (PSQG). The\nservice has been endorsed by dozens of leading\nscientists, science communicators and historians,\nand will provide instant quotations on a variety of\nsubjects from across the Academy. Surprisingly, the\nquotes will be entirely automatically-generated.\nThe PSQG engine allows the user to specify a\nsubject area, a subcategory, and a scientist. \u201cSo far\nwe have Stephen Pinker, Richard Dawkins, Susan\nGreenfield, Martin Rees and many others signed\nup,\u201d D\u2019Angelo said. The entire body of printed and\nrecorded commentary by each Prominent Scientist\nis put on the PSQG system. The engine scans that\narchive for matching opinions and uses a syntactic\nalgorithm to put those opinions into a coherent\nquote. The user can even specify the length and\ntone of the statement.\nHowever, certain opinion topics will be restricted\nto certain scientists. Stephen Hawking will comment on astrophysics, alien life, the Universe, and\nGod. Historian of science Lisa Jardine will comment on the Royal Society, the Enlightenment and\nthe Scientific Method. Dawkins will comment on\nanything. Indeed, the more forthright commentators are proving hard to integrate into the PSQG\nsystem, as chief coder Sam Spode described: \u201cWe\nhad to create a separate subroutine for Richard\nand we ran over a thousand test cycles of the\nDawkinator before we produced a single quote that\ndidn\u2019t libel anyone.\u201d\nAs D\u2019Angelo points out, the service is doubly\nbeneficial:\n\u201cIt helps the science writer and the Prominent\nScientist. The writer gains by being saved the difficulty of tracking down a scientist who tends to be\nunavailable just as the copy deadline approaches.\nThe scientist is saved the trouble of having to\nremember what his or her opinions are on every\nlittle issue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s especially helpful for Stephen [Hawking]\n\u2013 he won\u2019t need to do nearly as much clicking\u2026 In\nfact, we predict that the research productivity of\nour Prominent Scientists will shoot up once we\u2019ve\ngot going \u2013 they will actually be able to do some\nscience!\u201d\nThePQSGwillalsobeaflexibleservice.Prominent\nScientists will be able to log in regularly, edit their\nopinion profiles, and tweak the rules that govern\ntheir automated responses.\nFor instance, Jared Diamond could be pushing\nsome new writing, so he ensures all his automated\nquotes include the phrase: \u201cFor example, in my new\nbook\u2026\u201d, thus ensuring effortless publicity, even\nwhilst he sleeps.\nD\u2019Angelo is negotiating with some older scientists\nto \u201carchive their views before their gene-vehicles\ncease to function. We\u2019ve got Freeman Dyson and\nJames Watson on board, but sadly we missed out on\nJohn Maynard Smith and Fred Hoyle.\u201d\nD\u2019Angelo, however, revealed they are developing\nPoe \u2013 the Past Opinion Extrapolator \u2013 a tool which\ngenerates quotes on subjects many years after the\nsource has died. \u201cPoe will extrapolate an opinion\non a contemporary subject on the basis of what is\nknown about a particular scientist\u2019s historical atti-tudes. We\u2019ll be able to have Marie Curie on nuclear\npower, Galileo on the Mars Programme and Newton\non String Theory!\u201d\nWriter\u2019s\nBlock\nDuncan\nMcMillan\nh\ne\nNewer\nScientist\nCentral London admittedly, but the\ndissection was extraordinary and the\nspecimens were truly flawless.\nAs I continued through the exhibi-tion, I spoke to an elderly couple staring intently at a nearby body. I asked\nthem what they thought of the exhibition and why they travelled all the way\nto Earl\u2019s Court from Brighton, a question which was certainly met by an\ninteresting response. Not attracted\nby the gore and hyperbole, the couple were actually considering donating their bodies to medical research.\nNever before had I met someone who\nwas serious about doing such a thing\n\u2013 I expected the attendees at the\nexhibition to be sensation-seekers,\nnot potential body donors!\nThe educational worth of the displays was forced upon us throughout\nthe exhibition; anatomy snippets of\ntrivia were plastered across the walls\nwith an explanatory plaque positioned\nboldly next to each exhibit. I think the\nline was crossed, however, when we\nfell victim to a room full of foetuses\naround an obscure half-way corner.\nThe room seemed to shock more than\neducate, babies at various stages of\ndevelopment were curtained in darkness and set out in a similar fashion\nto watches on a jeweller\u2019s table.\nMoving through the exhibition,\nhuman interaction returned with\na vengeance. Set out like a market\nstall, a solitary staff member stood\nin wait for passers-by with the aim of\nallowing visitors to feel and \u2018experience\u2019 a selection of specimens. As I\napproached the table, I was offered\na slice of brain and a bone to \u2018play\nwith\u2019. Wrongfully identifying the bone\nas a femur, I was promptly corrected\nand embarrassed by my non-exist-ent level of anatomy knowledge after\nthree years of medical school!\nSurrounding the table were numerous glass cases containing diseased\nbody parts \u2013 a part of the exhibition\nthat forced us to think about the\nimpact of everyday \u2018pleasures\u2019 on\nour own health. A healthy lung was\ndisplayed alongside a diseased blackened smoke-tarnished specimen, and\nclose by was a glass case contain-We tend to\ndesign inefficient\nsystems that\nare uncontrolled\nand lead to\nexhaustion and\ncollapse We\ntend to design\ninefficient\ning hundreds of cigarette packets, a\nstark reminder of the consequences\nof some of our everyday actions.\nThere is no doubt that the exhibition set out to teach us some valuable lessons about the body in both\ndisease and health; however, I could\nnot help but wonder whether such\nelaborate gestures were necessary to\nprovide us with a deeper insight into\nour being. As the boundary between\nscience and art becomes more tenu-ous, it is difficult to comprehend how\nsensationalist displays of bare human\nflesh can help us further our own\nunderstanding of our bodies and convey the sense of respect we naturally\nhold for the dead.\nVisitors at the end of the exhibition were invited to fill out cards\nto describe their experiences during\nthe day. One girl wrote: \u201cTell us a\nbit more about the bodies \u2013 who are\nthey?\u201d She might well have a point.\nBODIES\u2026The Exhibition is now on\nat Earls Court. For more details visit\nwww.bodiestheexhibition.com.\nTop: An exhibit showing the circulatory and respiratory systems. This was achieved by injecting coloured\nplastics into the bodies and then removing all other parts.
