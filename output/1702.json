The dawn\nof science comes swiftly,\nhowever, and you\u2019re\nsuddenly surrounded\nby intricate hand-drawn\nbooks of sunspot obser-vations, and an elegant\nreplica of Copernicus\u2019\nOn the Revolutions of\nHeavenly Orbs \u2013 the\nseminal text in the development of a heliocentric\nmodel of the solar system.\nIn the absence of\nphysical understanding,\none of the major things\nthat could be learned\nfrom the Sun was a\nsense of timekeeping.\nThis is reflected in the\nexhibition via an array\nof clocks, ranging from\ndelicate orreries, through\nto the first accurate atomic\nclock, built at the UK\u2019s\nNational Physical Laboratory in 1955. As always\nwith the Science Museum,\ninteractive displays take\ncentre stage, and at this\npoint we\u2019re treated to a\nfun game involving the\nuse of different kinds of\nsundials.\nNext up, we view the\nSun from the perspective\nof health and medicine.\nSunlight as a treatment for\ntuberculosisisaprominent\nfeature, including some\nquaint advertising campaigns promoting beach\nholidays, and a rather\nhorrific looking mirrored\nsunbed for children,\ndesigned by John Harvey\nKellogg, of Cornflake\nfame. A manmade beach\nin neon and chrome offers\nviewers brief respite and\nthe chance to recline while\nlistening to the sounds of\nbeaches around the world\nthrough handheld coconut\nspeakers. The juxtaposition is frank, however, and\nworship turns to warning\nupon the realisation of\nthe dangers associated\nwith overexposure to\nsunlight. Now the posters\npromote covering up,\nstaying indoors, or better\nstill, buying a range of\nprotective products. This\nculminates in a television\nad from the much-loved\nAustralian 80s campaign\nSlip-Slop-Slap. At the\nclose of this section, we\u2019re\ngiven the chance to try on\nhistorical sunglasses, from\nInuit wooden goggles to\n50s fashion glasses, in a\nvirtual mirror.\nFrom here we enter\nmore modern times, with\ndisplays on how the Sun\ncan be used as an energy\nresource, and our attempts\nto recreate its power in\nnuclear fusion projects\nsuch as JET and ITER. A\nstark yellow \u201csunbeam\u201d\ninstallation punctuates\nand illuminates the room,\nand there are yet more\nhands-on experiences\nsuch as a giant LED screen\nwhere you can watch the\nsun rise in a location and\nseason of your choice, and\na challenge to charge a\ngiant battery by directing a\nbeam across the table with\nrotating mirrors. From\nhere we learn about the\nSun\u2019s structure, and its influence on Earth by virtue\nof its powerful magnetic\nfield. A charming animation tells the story\nof astronomer Richard\nCarrington and the great\nsolar flare of 1859 which\ncaused aurorae so bright\nthat people were able to\nread at the dead of night\nwithout a lamp. The\npotential for a large solar\nstorm to massively disrupt\nall technology on Earth is\nexplained; there\u2019s a game\nwhere you can attempt to\nsave the planet by spotting\nactive regions on the Sun\nwhich threaten to erupt,\nand a \u2018survival kit\u2019 for a\ngeomagnetic storm. While\nthe dramatization is fun, it\nis perhaps overstated to\nthe extent of fear-mon-gering, painting the Sun\u2019s\nawesome power as a\ndeadly threat to life on\nEarth. While not untrue,\nit is perhaps at odds with\nthe tone of the rest of the\nexhibition.\nThis segues into a\nbrief history of space\nmissions to study the Sun,\nincluding Skylab, Helios\nand Ulysses. Perhaps a\npersonal highlight of the\nexhibition was a scale\nmodel of the Solar Orbiter\nprobe which, upon its\nscheduled launch in 2020,\nwill carry a magnetometer\nbuilt here at Imperial all\nthe way to the Sun. Sitting\nfar out on the back of the\nspacecraft, the instrument\nis designed to withstand\ntemperatures ranging\nfrom 80\u00b0C to -140\u00b0C. A\nprototype sits in a glass\ncase, beneath a video\ninterview with instrument\nmanager and department\nof Physics\u2019 very own\nHelen O\u2019Brien.\nThe grand finale is a\ncinema room showing\nstunning footage from\nNASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics\nObservatory, where the\nSun can be seen up close\nin a variety of wavelengths\n\u2013 turbulent and eruptive as\nits fiery plasma coils elegantly around its complex\nnetwork of magnetic field\nlines. While quite short\nfor a relatively steep price,\nthis is an informative and\nenjoyable exhibition that\ncovers everything about\nthe Sun from our earliest\nunderstandings to the\ncutting edge science of\ntoday.\nHere comes the Sun, doo doo doo doo // Solar Dynamics Observatory/NASA\nARTS\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nWhere?

The time for change is now.\nCOMMENT\nAndrew Melville\nComment Writer\nL\nast week,\nLoughborough\nU n i v e r s i t y\nannounced they\nwould be launching an\ninvestigation into two\nof its students, resulting in the immediate\nsuspension of one. This\nwas the University\u2019s\nresponse to what it\nreferred to as a \u201cracist\nand misogynistic\u201d post\non the \u201cLoughborough\nTowersposting\u201d Facebook\ngroup, a student run\nmeme page. The offensive\npicture was posted to the\n\u201cDiscussion\u201d section of\nthe meme page by one of\nthe students, an area where\nthe posts are not vetted by\nthe admins. The student\nthat made the post was\nsuspended, and the other\nstudent was an admin for\nthe page. Should both\nreceive the same punish-ment? Perhaps not, but the\nincident sets a scary precedent for how Universities\nshould deal with student\nFacebook groups made in\ntheir name.\nMemeperial, Imperial\u2019s own meme page, has\naround 10,000 likes at\ntime of writing. College\nis obviously aware of\nthe page, as they have\n\u201cborrowed\u201d content\nfrom them on multiple\noccasions. However,\nno action has ever been\ntaken against the admins\nof the group, nor has\nany contact been made\nbetween the admins of\nthe page and College\nstaff, despite some posts\nerring on the edgy side.\nSimilar to Loughborough Towersposting,\nMemeperial also has a\nvisitor posts section.\nCrucially, posts in this\nsection do not require\nadmin approval to be\nshared on the page, and\nso the same issue could\noccur here. That the\nadmin for the page is\nbeing held accountable\nfor what a user has submitted is ridiculous, but\nuniversities should have\nsome influence in what\nis posted using their\nname and image. That\nthe influence should\nextend to suspension of\nstudents is awful.\nI can understand\ntaking action against a\nstudent who intentionally posts content that\ncan bring the college\ninto disrepute. The\ncollege has a reputation\nto uphold and donations\nfrom alumni and associations with companies\nto protect. But what\nif a graduate posts\ndamaging or offensive\ncontent? How about\na student of another\nuniversity? Without the\noption of suspension,\nwould these institutions\nopt for a legal route to\npunish such pages? The\nlatter example is not just\na thought experiment:\nAnglia Ruskin Memes\n(a page about Anglia\nRuskin University of all\nthings) is run by Cambridge Uni students.\nWho is supposed to\npunish them if they\npost unsavoury content?\nWould Cambridge University take action and\nsuspend the students?\nWould Anglia Ruskin\ntake legal action?\nWhile University\nshould be a place where\nstudents are able to\nexpress themselves\nfreely, an important part\nof being a student is\nbeing treated as a pro-fessional: this is where\nyour career begins.\nStudent activity can and\ndoes affect the bottom\nline of universities,\neither through donations\nfrom alumni or affecting\nadmissions. That pages\nexpect freedom to\npublish anything they\nwant while using their\nUniversity\u2019s crest badly\nphotoshopped to include\nPepe the Frog is unrea-sonable. But freedom\nto criticise the uni you\npay so much to attend\nis equally a vital part of\nthe student experience,\nas shown by the wealth\nof media run by and\npresented to students in\nalmost every university\nin the country.\nIndeed, the content\non many of these pages\nis of a similar nature\nto that published by\nstudent newspapers,\noperating outside the\ninfluence of the faculty.\nOften critical of their\nuniversity, or faculties\nthereof, they are mostly\nfree to post and publish\nwhatever they want. Yet\nthese pages don\u2019t benefit\nfrom the protections\nand rights extended to\nthem by the unions that\nfund these institutions.\nPerhaps unions adopting\ntheir related pages\nwould solve this issue,\nproviding protection for\nthe admins of the pages,\nwhile adding some necessary checks on what\nis and isn\u2019t posted in the\nuniversities name.\nThe actions taken by\nLoughborough University have resulted in\nstudent pages being shut\ndown, and this a trend\nthat we\u2019re beginning to\nsee in universities across\nthe country. That a large\npart of the community\nand modern student experience has been taken\nThe offending meme // Loughborough Uni Memes\n\u201cThe admin\nshould not\nbe held\naccountable\nfor what the\nuser publicly\nposted\u201d\naway is such a shame.\nWith student newspapers and student unions\nseemingly unwilling or\nunable to fill this niche,\nmeme pages are able to\ntap into an undercurrent\nof the student experience that adds a new\ndimension to university\nlife. Perhaps that is why\nImperial is so willing\nto allow Memeperial\nto continue posting its\nshite, as long as it does\nnothing to damage their\nbottom line. Whether it\nis adoption by the union,\nor some other solution,\nthese pages need to find\na way to stay afloat,\nwhile monitoring the\ncontent posted.\nLoughborough Meme Page\u2019s current profile picture // Loughborough Uni Memes\n\u201cPages need\nto find a\nway to stay\nafloat while\nmonitoring\nthe content\nposted\u201d\n\n"

Every week\nI tell myself that it's the\nweek that I will get organised and do things in\nadvance and, every week,\nI flop the set...\nWith the excitement of\ngraduating last week, this\nweek feels like it's been\nreally dull and uneventful.\nI'm genuinely wracking\nmy brain trying to\nremember if anything of\nnote happened this week.\nAs you can probably tell,\nI still don't know how to\nwrite an editorial. At this\npoint, I don't think I ever\nwill. Alas, we ramble on...\nIt's perhaps quite depressing and embarrassing that the most eventful\nthing that has happened\nto me this week is attending my first ever Union\nCouncil meeting. After\nsuccesfully skipping the\nfirst meeting of the year\n(I'm sure I had a good\nexcuse), I could no longer\ndodge my responsibility\nas the resident fly-on-the-wall. With no voting\nrights, I sat there and\nwatched riveting discussions and spirited debate\nabout topics including\nUnion penalties for sexual\nmisconduct and Ethos'\nsquash court pricing. A\nmotiontostopthestocking\nand display of racist\ntabloids, such as The Sun,\nthe Daily Mail and the\nDaily Express, sparked a\nparticularly heated debate\nwhich somehow spiralled\ninto a wider discussion\nabout censorship and free\nspeech on our campus.\nIt made for enthralling\nviewing, with personal\nattacks flying across the\nroom left, right and centre.\nI was on the edge of my\nseat and the only thing I\nregret is not bringing my\npopcorn.

I urge\nanybody reading to get\nmore involved in Council\nand to attempt to effect\nchange. Of course, that\nmeans nothing because\nnobody is still reading\nmy incessant rambling\nanyway...\nI'd like to end my editorial this week by thanking\neverybody that reached\nout after reading my\neditroial last week. The\nkind words, condolences\nand heartwarming offers\nof support have kept me\ngoing through what's been\na tough few weeks. I found\nit incredibly difficult to\nwrite my letter to Lauren\nbut I felt slightly better afterwards and I really hope\nthat it was able to be some\ncomfort to anyone that\nknew and loved her.

Arts Writer Calum Drysdale gives his\ntake on the shortlistees for one of the world\u2019s best known awards for visual arts.\nA\nfriend and I had\na conversation\nrecently about\nwhether there\nwas something fundamental to non-conforming (he\nis into that sort of thing).\n\u201cBy going outside of what\nis socially acceptable one\ndefies. That act of independence and definition\nof oneself not by others\u2019\nstandards but by one\u2019s\nown is the greatest sign of\nself-liberation possible.\u201d\n\u201cSure, I get all that,\nbut don\u2019t you all just roll\nyour jeans up and wear\nnon-functional shoes?\u201d\nReading up about what\nwas on at the Turner prize\nbefore going did give me\na certain sense of valida-tion. All four of the shortlisted artists are exhibiting\nfilms, certainly enough\nto drive the annual Daily\nMail think pieces asking\n\u2018Is this really art? Really?\u2019\ninto overdrive. How dif-ferent, I asked myself, can\nyou possibly be if you all\ninsist on being different\ntogether?\nGetting to the right\ngallery requires further\nhiking than expected,\nthrough ambiguously\nsized rooms that all\nsqueeze in one and a half\nidentical acrylic and steel\nsculptures intended to\nconfound any sense of\ndirection or taste.\nA large, square and\nwonderfully sound-in-sulated room greets you\nas you come through the\ndoors. On the walls are\npanels providing brief\ndescriptions of each of\nthe films and wonderfully suggestive open\ndoorways that lead off\ninto the darkness. It feels\nlike quibbling but I would\nrecommend reading up\nbefore going as the panels\nare rather heavy on niche\nfilm and technical jargon\nand proportionally light\non content, but it is a\nmiser\u2019s complaint.\nThe films themselves\ncertainly showed me the\nerror of my ways. The\nprize, given each year, is\nintended to recognise and\ncelebrate art produced\nor first exhibited the\nyear before. This is art\nas contemporary as it is\npossible to be and, with\na few notable exceptions,\nit bursts with life and\nambition.\n\u201cThis is art as\ncontemporary\nas it is possible\nto be... it\nbursts with life\nand ambition\u201d\n\u201cLike a thriller,\nit jumps\nbetween light\nand dark,\naction and\nsilence\u201d\nThe Charlotte Rogers\nfilm is a bizarre masterpiece of mashed\ntogether footage, but it\navoids sinking into kitsch\nthrough the relentless\nhumanity that powers it\nthroughout. The audience\nis welcomed in to Charlotte\u2019s life and can often\nsee exactly what Charlotte\nxeself saw through xe\u2019s\nuse of small handheld\ncameras that allow a quiet\nto permeate the film, even\nover the amazing sound\ntrack. The long non-mov-ing shots work to draw in\nthe audience and, rather\nthan growing dull (some\ngo on for 10 minutes),\nthey pulsate with tension\nand danger. Add to this\nthe piece\u2019s tying together\nof the ancient Yatesesque\nmagic and myth of Aberdeenshire Scotland with\nmodern gender-question-ing identity and this is a\nfilm that makes worth the\nwhole trip worthwhile.\nLuke Willis Thompson\ntakes a different approach\nin his submission. He very\nclosely examines five\nseparate lives and takes\nthis magnifying glass\napproach to extremes,\ninvestigating human\nbodies \u2013 with an emphasis\non people of colour\nand their historical and\ncurrent reality. In his most\nsurreal piece he moves the\ncamera around and inside\na house-like sculpture\nmade of human skin and\ndressmaker\u2019s pins. The\nsculpture exists as an\nindependent piece of art \u2013\nMy Mother. My Father. My\nSister. My Brother 1996-7\n(The Estate of Donald G.\nRodney, London) \u2013 and is\nmade of the skin removed\nby surgeons during\nRodney\u2019s treatment for\nsickle cell anaemia.\nUncomfortable is not\na strong enough word\nto describe the feelings\nevoked. As the film goes\non, the house begins to\nresemble a body itself,\nsteel bones holding up\nan incredibly tiny and\nfragile creation. Where he\noverreaches is his portrait\nof Diamond Reynolds,\nthe girlfriend of Philando\nCastile, shot at a traffic\nstop in 2016. The film is\nmeant as an accompanying piece to her Facebook\nLive video shot in the aftermath of her boyfriend\u2019s\nkilling, but it feels cheap\nand profiteering.\nForensic architecture\u2019s\nThe Long Duration of a\nSplit Second has the most\nimmediate and visceral\nappeal of the four films.\nLike a thriller, it jumps\nbetween light and dark,\naction and silence, and\nunlike the other three the\ncontent feels necessary\nand even vital. The real\nworld, normally very\nfar away in those dark\nshowing rooms, rushes in\nand cannot be denied.\nThe film tells the story\nof the killing of a villager\nin Umm al-Hiran, a\nBedouin community in\nthe Negev/Naqab desert\nwhich the Israeli army\nwas attempting to destroy.\nThis is modern activism\nwith baubles on.\nFinally, there is Naeem\nMohaiemen.

Watching an\nimmaculately linen-suited\nman smoke cigarettes in\nan abandoned airport,\ncradling dressmakers\u2019\nmanikins \u2013 it felt like there\nwas meaning floating\naround somewhere, but\nit was too amorphous to\ngrasp.

In\nThe Distance You Have\nCome there are plenty of\npositive moments. The\nsinging was pretty good,\nimportant as the whole\n\u2018song cycle\u2019 is done \u2018Les\nMiz\u2019 style, though the\nmusic system sometimes\nfailed to keep up with the\nactors\u2019 gusto.\nThe theatre was close\nand intimate, the stage\nround and simple. The\nprops, a bench and a\nswing, were often well\nused, though there is a\nlimit to how many times\none can stand up on a\nswing and it still be en-dearing. There are funny\nparts and Jodie Jacobs as\nAnna was exceptional,\nfunny and endearing.\nI can\u2019t decide whether\nto include in this list the\nfact that LG and B is\nrepresented in a touching\nand non-tokenistic way.\nShould we cheer when\nwriters do what is right\nand proper? I include it\nas important and relevant\nand in recognition of the\nworld we live in.\nreferences (\u2018Once upon\na time\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m a Star\u2019 and\n\u2018Magic\u2019 to name the first\nthree). This makes the\ncast feel petulant and\nimmature. These are\ngrown adults making poor\nlife decisions and singing\nabout going to Neverland.\nThe first half continues\nin this way, lurching\nbetween the sugar sweet\nhappiness of Brian and\nSamuel as the post-racial,\npost-hetero power couple\nand the unfulfilled misery\nof the rest of the cast.\nWhat is the point being\nmade here? The two\nlesbians sing about one\nof them walking out and\nleaving only a note. They\nstill look pretty happy in\ncomparison to the other\nwoman, who, failing auditions left and right, has\npulled a disappearing act,\nand the remaining bloke\nwho takes his clothes off\nto reveal an incredible\nbody in a lovely set piece\ninvolving generic hooded\nfigures. Depression never\nlooked this good and we\nretire for the interval and\ndrinks.\nThis is a trendy place\nso date and I get a tumbler\nof red on the house. This\nis why one becomes an\nart critic; opportunities\nfor accepting bribery\nabound. Potentially aided\nby the wine or loose\njournalistic morals, the\nsecond half begins strong.\nThe show tunes feel more\nappropriate to the second\nhalf spirit of \u2018it\u2019ll all be\nalright in the end\u2019 and the\ncast actually feel united in\nrecovery, Brianuel having\nfallen into some easily\nresolvable strife. Drunk\ngets picked up and dunked\nin the magic cure-all\nbench whose seat lifts up\nto reveal a trough of all\nthings. Quick wipe of the\nmagic sponge and clothes\nback on and he is ready\nfor a meeting with his ex,\nwho lo and behold is the\nwoman who magically/\nconveniently gets her\nBroadway part.\nLove is amazingly\nrevealed to be the cure to\neverything as Samurian\ncop themselves a baby and\nAnna the \u201cstereotypical\nlesbian in recovery\u201d meets\n\u201cstereotypical alcoholic\nin recovery\u201d. She looks at\nhis arse and, get this, the\nfemale jogger\u2019s and your\nheart melts a little bit as\nthey go for a walk. Top\nthe whole thing off with\nyet another anthem called\n\u2018The Distance You Have\nCome\u201d to tell us all to\nkeep going, find love and\nbe happy. Love Actually\nand Shrek come together\nin the end and we never\nsaw it coming.\nThis could be someone\u2019s cup of tea. The cast\nis star spangled and the\nmusic bounces along.\nSome of the songs are\nfinger tappingly good\n(though I can\u2019t remember\nany of the lyrics) and the\nactors are all very cute.\nThe Cockpit Theatre is\nclose in Marylebone, and\nif the mood took you this\ncould be a very fun night\nout. Go if you want to, go\nif you don\u2019t.\nDepression, alcoholism, and fairytale romance: all this and more told through the medium of song in a star-spangled production of The Distance You Have Come at the Cockpit Theatre.\nIs love really all around?

This is a brief survey - I\u2019ll be back next week with much\nmore detail. The one thing I know is when I come to power Trump\u2019s first against the wall.\nCOMMENT\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nT\nhe midterms are\nnearly upon us,\nand this is no\nfun for anybody.\nAnd before you get excited about a possible radical\nchange in the US federal\ngovernment, take a dose\nof reality, bud. Shit slides\nslowly. But, with luck,\nshit will slide the right\nway.\nQuick refresher for\nthose of you not knowledgeable about the US\ncivic process: the legislature is a bicameral system,\nfeaturing the House (one\nrepresentative per district,\nby population) and the\nSenate (two senators per\nstate; this is the senior\nhouse). Senators are\nelected to six-year terms;\nrepresentatives are elected\nto two-year terms. Hence,\nin these elections, 35\nSenate seats and all House\nseats are up for grabs.\nUnfortunately, the\nelection cycle is not conducive to giving Trump\nthe complete BTFO\u2019ing he\nso desperately deserves.\n23 Senate seats held\nby Dems are not up for\nreelection - compared to\n42 on the GOP side. This\nis problematic - while the\nDems are expected to pick\nup a seat or two in the\nSenate, it\u2019s not looking so\ngood for a majority.\nThe good news is that\nFiveThirtyEight (the most\naccurate and reputable\nelection forecast besides\nthe surprisingly spot-on\nproclamations of the\ninfamous Carl \u201cThe Dig\u201d\nDiggler, a creation of\nsatirists Felix Biederman\nand Virgil Texas) ... ok,\nsorry for the long parenthetical - FiveThirtyEight\npredicts about a 6 in 7\n(85%) chance of Democrats taking a majority in\nthe House. Sorry for the\nrun-on, Charlie, I\u2019m tired.\nThis is good news\nbecause this will be sufficient to produce two years\nof legislative deadlock.\nThe unfortunate game\nof obstructionism must\nWant to be on the Felix team this year?\nFelix is recruiting new section editors and copy editors for this year!\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed reading the paper, and want to help create it each week,\napply to join the team! All training is provided, as well as weekly cake, so\ncome and join us!\nIf you\u2019re interested, please email felix@ic.ac.uk\nbe played - Trump wants\nto bring back asbestos,\nforfuckssake. His administration is a trainwreck,\nobviously. He must be\nrendered impotent as\nquickly as possible; a\nDemocratic house will\nyield this result.\nMoreover, the House\nand Senate intelligence\ncommittees are currently\ncontrolled by Republicans, who so far have\nbeen primarily interested\nin covering Trump\u2019s ass,\nrather than do any kind\nof serious oversight. In\nparticular, Devin Nunes\nis a bastard who should\nbe taken to the wall and\nshot for his abandonment\nof bipartisanship (he and\nranking Democrat Adam\nSchiff had previously\nenjoyed a good working\nrelationship).\nThis means that\nprevious GOP obstruction\nof executive oversight,\nand, say, releasing details\nabout the Mueller probe,\nwill be counteracted. This,\nin turn, will help build\nmomentum for the 2020\nrace.\nSpeaking of the 2020\nrace, candidates are\nangling for their runs\nnow, though nobody will\nannounce until next year.\nThere are tells, though -and it looks like Sanders\nwill run again. This time\nthrough, he\u2019ll curb-stomp\nthe establishment Dems\n(many are running, and\nthey\u2019ll split the field like\nthe GOP did in 2016).\nAnd the orange take\non all this? Trump\u2019s producing some hilariously\nspicy rhetoric because\nhe\u2019s shitting himself about\nthe midterms. Have y\u2019all\nseen that stuff about the\nCaravan? Watch out, there\nmight be Middle Easterners in it. It\u2019s definitely not\njust Hondurans who hope\nfor better living conditions and shelter amidst\nthe growing threat of\nfascism in South America\n(see Brazil).\nIt\u2019s typical Trumpian\nrhetoric, and can obviously be waved off as\nhyperbolic racism. I hope\nhe\u2019s panicking right now.\nCome to think of it, he\nshould be taken out and\nshot, too.\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFRIDAY, 26TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18\nVenom: The Worst Kind of Bad Film\nfound really engaging.\nIt\u2019s the worst kind of\nbad film: passion and\ntalent are on display and\nat some point this thing\ncould have been truly\ngreat. But it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s\ntalk about why.\nThere is some good to\nbe found here. Tom Hardy\nis as brilliant as always,\nand he brings depth and\ncharisma to Eddie Brock\nthrough his performance,\ndespite some poor script-ing. Michelle Williams\ndoes a fine job as Eddie\u2019s\nex-girlfriend Anne. Their\nchemistry is decent and\nis a defiance of clich\u00e9;\nyou never get the sense\nshe secretly wants him\nor would take him back.\nI found Anne\u2019s new\nboyfriend Dan, played by\nReid Scott, to be another\nclich\u00e9 dodge as he seems\nlike a genuinely good\nperson and never feels\nlike his relationship is\nthreatened by Eddie. In\nfact, you get the feeling\nthis new relationship is\nfar healthier than Eddie\nand Anne\u2019s, a dimension\nI\u2019m sure would have been\nexplored if this film had a\nmore adult rating.\nVenom himself looks\nvery comic-esque in a\nreally good way and the\ndesign of the loose symbi-otes is suitably weird and\nalien . There is the occasional animation quality\ndip, but for the most part\nit does the job. There are\nsome solid action beats\ntoo. The motorcycle chase\nfeatured in the trailer is\nexcellent and does an\nadequate job establishing\nVenom\u2019s powers. There\nis also a pretty good fight\nscene with a SWAT team\nlater on, though the films\nclimax is an incomprehensible mess with absolutely\nno stakes.\nAnd with that let\u2019s\nsegue into the bad. A\nhuge amount of this film\nis taken up following\nCarlton Drake, a painfully\ngeneric villain playing the\n\u2018humans are imperfect,\nI will bring a new age of\nevolution\u2019 card. Puddle\ndeep, in no way relatable,\nthe worst type of villain.\nDrake is the head of Stock\nAmoral Corporation\nwho made millions...\nsomehow. Like, they\u2019re\na pharmaceuticals development group who\nillegally test on homeless\npeople, but they also have\nmultiple high tech space\nshuttles that they use to\nsearch asteroids because\nmaybe there is a miracle\ncure in space? It\u2019s clearly\na case of trying to create\nan antagonist more evil\nthan the protagonist so we\ndon\u2019t have to deal with any\ncomplex morality. This is\nalso probably why, by the\nend of it, Venom (a classic\ncomic book villain) is just\nanother defender of earth.\nOh, and the final boss is so\ndull and underdeveloped I\ncan\u2019t even be bothered to\ndiscuss him.\nI could talk specifics\nforever, but I think it\u2019s\nworth taking a look at\nthe tone as a whole. In\nthe Stock Amoral Corporation scenes the film\ntries for that Alien style of\nsci-fi unknown horror, but\nfails spectacularly given\nDrake\u2019s cartoonish level\nof evil.

Yet\nin a world where politics,\ncelebrities and other\nmatters dominate the\nnews and social media,\nrenowned environmentalists and their efforts are\nneither attractive nor offensive enough to garner\npublic attention.\nThis is also the case\nwith Malaysia, my native\ncountry, blessed with\ntropical biodiversity and\nample natural resources\nbut under threat from\ncontinuing urban devel-opment. Although public\nenvironmental awareness has significantly\nimproved in the country,\nthe lack of genuine action\nand individual initiatives\nto address the situation is\nalarming. The few, inef-fective, individual efforts\nto tackle environmental\nissues do not mask the\ngeneral \u201cselfishness\u201d\nregarding the issue, points\nout Gurmit Singh K.S., a\nprominent Malaysian environmentalist and social\nactivist.\nIt was World Environment Day on June 6, 1979,\nwhen he donned a gas\nmask and raced a car with\nhis bicycle for 12 miles\nacross Kuala Lumpur to\nhighlight air pollution and\ntraffic problems in the\nMalaysian capital. Nearly\n40 years later, the photograph of him on his bike\nwith the gas mask became\nhis most iconic photo and\neventually the cover for\nhis memoir, Memoirs of a\nMalaysian Eco-Activist.\nThe book is obviously\nunlike Carson\u2019s Silent\nSpring, which is focused\non environmental science.\nRather, it is an honest\naccount of Gurmit\u2019s\nlife and journey as an\nenvironmental and social\nactivist. While it is a short,\nstraight-to-the-point\naccount of his life, the\nmessage he tries to deliver\nextends far beyond envi-ronmentalism. He took\nalmost five years to finish\nthe manuscript amid his\nbusy schedules, constantly dogged by concerns\nthat nobody would want\nto read such unexciting\nsubjects. He feared that\nthe average individual\nwould turn indifferent\nonce the word \u201cenvironment\u201d is expressed.\nHe tells his tale from\nthe moment he was\nborn in 1942 to Punjabi\nparents in Penang Island,\nduring World War II when\nthe Japanese invaded\nMalaysia (then Malaya).\n\u201cI never really picked\nup Punjabi as a language.\u201d\nHe recalls during an interview in 2009, regarding\nhis roots. \u201cIf you want to\nbelieve in the importance\nof your mother tongue,\nfine \u2013 but I don\u2019t feel\ndeculturalised. In fact, I\nresent being reminded that\nI\u2019m Indian, or Punjabi.\nPeople should be dealt\nwith as individuals.\u201d\nDuring his school days,\nhe was an active scout and\nfrequently went out with\nhis friends on bicycles to\ndiscover new places in\nthe environment. From a\nyoung age he was taught\nby his mother not to waste\nby recycling cloth flour\nbags into bedsheets.\nInitially an electrical\nengineer by profession,\nhe graduated from the\nUniversity of Malaya in\n1970 after encountering\na few impediments due\nto his zealous activism\nin university affairs. By\nthe time the Malaysian\ngovernment enacted the\nCan you see the twin towers?// The Star Malaysia\nBOOKS\nFRIDAY, 26TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nMalaysian eco-activist Gurmit Singh K.S. // ASEAN Affairs\nenvironmental and social activism in Malaysia\n\u201cWith a\npopulation\nof 32 million,\nit takes\ntremendous\ncollective\neffort to\nproduce\nresults\u201d\n\u201cThis is\na sincere\naccount from\none who\nwitnessed\nhis country\u2019s\nmarch towards\nindustrialisation\u201d\nEnvironmental Quality\nAct in 1974, Gurmit had\nmet people from various\nscientific backgrounds\nduring his job at the\nRubber Research Institute\nand was ultimately drawn\nto environmental affairs.\nThat was also the year\nhe founded his first NGO\n\u2013 Environmental Protection Society, Malaysia\n(EPSM), from which he\nofficially began his environmental activism career\nand never looked back.\nAbout 10 years later in\n1985, he would establish\nanother NGO \u2013 Centre\nfor Environment, Technology and Development,\nMalaysia (CETDEM)\n\u2013 which he chairs to this\nday. CETDEM\u2019s slogan,\n\u2018Always Promoting Sustainable Development\u2019,\nsums up their ambitious\nbut challenging objectives\n\u2013 to improve environmental quality through\nappropriate use of technology and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nHis decorated CV\nspeaks for itself; of the\nmany awards he has\nreceived, notable ones\ninclude the 2013 MDG\n7: Ensure Environmental\nSustainability Award from\nUnited Nations Malaysia,\nthe Green CatalystsAward\nin 2015, and most recently\nthe 2018 Merdeka (Inde-pendence) Award in the\nenvironment category.\nHis outspokenness\nabout environmental\nand social causes led to\na turbulent relationship\nwith the authorities;\nnonetheless he maintains\nhis humility outside his\nfield of work. I had the\npleasure of attending one\nof his speeches during a\nCETDEM public forum\nin 2015, and although we\nhad only a brief exchange\nof words, he came across\nas a relaxed and caring\nindividual.\nWhat about the current\nsituation in Malaysia?\nEnvironmental NGOs are\non the rise, awareness\ncampaigns are overflow-ing, and countless projects\nare being introduced to\naddress the unending\nissues. Yet the results are\nstill to be seen. He reiterates that Malaysians are\nvery good at starting new\nthings but are dreadful at\nmaintenance. Perhaps he\nis also pointing out the\n\u201cone-off\u201d projects and\npractices regarding the\nenvironment that have\nsurfaced in the past.\n\u201cEveryone thinks\nplanting trees is great. But\nthey forget that trees have\nto be maintained.\u201d He said\nduring his book launch in\n2017. \u201cI now tell people\nthat \u2018I will support your\neffort if you check every\nsix months to see if your\ntrees are alive\u2019\u201d.\nWith a population\nof 32 million, it takes\ntremendous and dedicated collective effort\nto produce results on\nimproving environmental\nmatters. Beneath the celebrated multiculturalism,\nbiodiversity and great\nfood, there are political\nscandals, discriminations\nand selfishness. How are\nwe supposed to focus on\nmaintaining individual\nenvironmental responsibilities with so many\nother distractions playing\nbehind the scenes?\n\u201cToo many people are\nselfish. But we must look\nbeyond ourselves. And\nwe must all take action\nto solve environmental\nproblems, because governments alone cannot do\nit. The power is with the\npeople.\u201d\nOn social issues, he\nhopes \u201cthat a day will\ncome when we have real\nmulticulturalism, when\nyou don\u2019t have to specify\nyour \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018religion\u2019\nin a government form.\u201d\nNow 75, he is still\nvisible on the activism\nfront and is a man of his\nword \u2013 living a life with\nminimal ecological foot-print. He resides with his\nwife, Tan Siew Luang, an\norganic-farming advocate,\nin a house equipped with\nsolar panels, a rainwater\nharvesting system, a\ncomposting site and\nrecycling spots. Today,\nwith heavy traffic obstructions a trademark of the\ncapital, he owns no car\nand depends on public\ntransportation, walking\nand cycling as modes of\ntravel. Continuing what\nhe started nearly 40 years\nago, this is clearly something close to his heart. Of\ncourse, he doesn\u2019t expect\neveryone to live exactly\nlike he does.\n\u201cWe can all make a difference in however small a\nway. Don\u2019t buy too much\nand refrain from buying\nunnecessary things, bring\nyour own bags when you\ngo shopping and so on.\nPeople always tell us they\nadmire us, but they do not\ndo anything on their part\nto save the environment.\u201d\nMemoirs of a Malaysian Eco-Activist was\npublished almost a year\nago in April 2017, and\nthough concise, the core\nmessage is still significant\nfor readers: Malaysia\nneeds to overcome selfishness and tackle environmental problems with\ndetermination. Whether\nyou are a fledgling environmentalist or someone\nwith an ambition to better\nthe world, this book is\na sincere account from\nsomeone who witnessed\nhis country\u2019s relentless\nmarch towards industri-alisation, and how his\nresolute passion shaped\nhis journey.\nGurmit with his wife, Tan Siew Luang // Sheila Sri Priya\nISSUE 1702\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nNeverending cars// Azhar Mahfof\n\n"

I\u2019m not too\nbig of a fan of the word\neither so please don\u2019t go\nballistic just yet. Read\non, try to keep an open\nmind, which I know\nis crazy hard, but how\n\u2019bout we try for just one\nsec?\nThings are better for\nwomen now. I mean,\nof course they are, any\nwoman can walk to\nthe bank and open an\naccount, any woman\ncan walk up to a university\u2019s admissions\nand apply... I could go\non and on. However,\nI\u2019d first like to make\nsure we\u2019re all on the\nsame page: I\u2019m talking\nfrom limited experience\nas a white woman in\nWestern Europe. I don\u2019t\npretend to know about\nanyone else in any other\nposition. This doesn\u2019t\nmake what I have to say\nany less relevant, but it\nmakes it my own: I just\nhave a thought to share.\nWe keep letting anger\nget in the way of these\nimportant discussions,\ntoo concerned about\nhow we get personally\noffended by what people\nhave to say instead of remembering we all have\nopinions, right or wrong\nas we may consider them\nto be. It\u2019s tiring to want\nto explain something to\nsomeone and having to\nyell to make yourself\nheard, it\u2019s tiring to focus\non the bad and forget the\ngood, and it\u2019s tiring to\nfocus on the good and\nremember the bad.\nI\u2019m writing this down\nbecause I knew if I tried\nsaying this out loud,\nI would probably let\nmyself get angry and\ncompletely ruin my\npoint. This way, I know\nwhere I\u2019m headed.\nI\u2019m going to tell you a\ntrue story. This summer,\nmy sixteen-year-old\nbrother told me with\ndisappointment, and\nsome sadness too, that\nhe didn\u2019t understand\nthe women\u2019s rights\nmovement. He told me\nhe felt a bit disheartened\nthat it was all about\nequal rights but not\nequal responsibilities.\nHe said he had a hard\ntime understanding the\nmovement when every\ntime he looked at the\ntruth, he was faced with\nhatred for being a man\nor the veil of politically\ncorrect limitations that\nhas come to surround\nmost big social chal-lenges. I was sad to hear\nhim say that, but also\nproud to see that he had\nbeen able to, calmly\nand rationally, give\nvoice to the opinions\na lot of people, women\nincluded, hold.\nHe was factual, he\nwas calm, he was also\nopen-minded. When I\ntold him he was mostly\nthinking of what people\nlike to refer to as\n\u201dfemi-nazis\u2019, he kind\nof agreed. I told him\nthe \u2019real\u2019, \u2019original\u2019\nfeminists wanted to\nhave opportunities and\nchoices just like guys\ndid. I told him I was a\nfeminist, and to me that\nmeant being allowed to\ngo out at night without\nbeing scared, sitting\nwherever I want on\nthe bus without being\nsubjected to lecherous\nstares, walking into any\nuniversity (humanities\nand science alike) and\nseeing fifty-fifty ratios.\nIt also means looking\nat the top earners and\nseeing as many girls as\ndudes and not having to\nchoose between career\nand kids. Men never\nhave to, they never\neven consider that pos-sibility! I have nothing\nagainst men, particularly shirtless ones. Oh\nwait... How does that\nfeel? But... I\u2019m not here\nto hate. I really want\nto make a fair, rational\npoint, and if anger is\npart of what sparked\nthis piece, it has no\nplace in its realization.\nI was recently in one\nof the most frustrating,\nanger-inducing, dis-appointing, saddening\narguments I have ever\nbeen in. I was told by\nprivileged white young\nmen that inequality\nbetween men and women\ndidn\u2019t exist anymore.\nI\u2019m going to let that\nsink in. Sunk in? They\nsaid that. Now, I think\nthey meant they didn\u2019t\nunderstand shit about\nwomen\u2019s minds and\nposition in the world.\nI\u2019m not here to hate or\nblame them. I\u2019m here\nto say that it\u2019s sad that\nconversation happened.\nYou see, they told me,\namongst other things,\nthat women made the\nchoice by themselves to\nput family before career\nbecause it ultimately\nmade them happier, that\nit was \u2019natural\u2019 and \u2019biological\u2019 for women to be\ncloser and more involved\nwith their kids than men,\nand that it was OK for\nwomen only to make the\nchoice between children\nand career. They told me\nthe feminist discourse of\nequal rights and opportunities was backwards,\noverturned, antiquated.\nI\u2019m going to give you a\nmoment to let that sink\nin too.\nI\u2019ll admit that sexism\nis no longer an issue of\nmen against women per\nse, and truth be told I\nthink equal rights do\n- theoretically - exist.\nSexism is a matter of\nsociety now, of preconceived ideas that we,\nyoung men and women,\nimpose on ourselves\nfor some reason. I said\nOne of the enduring symbols of feminis, Rosie the Riveter// Flickr\nthat. Those two replied\nwith something similar\nto, \u201csociety? That\u2019s just\nbullshit excuses to fuel\nbullshit causes.\u201d Ain\u2019t\nthat bullshit? It\u2019s like an\nold Dove advert that my\nfriend pointed out: kids\nof both genders were\nasked to run like a girl:\nthe eight-year-olds all\nran the same, and four-teen-year olds ran like\nconstipated dodos.\nI swear to you all\nthose guys assured me\nit was true girls ran\nweird. I don\u2019t know if\nthey thought that maybe\nI just wanted to run their\nfaces through a wall\nat that point? Wait. I\npromised no hate. Much\nless violence.\nThis actually brings\nme to my last point:\nbiology. So yes, there\nis a biological factor\nto the whole male-fe-male dynamic. This is\nImperial, and while we\nlove making fun of our\nbio friends, we do recognise their existence.\nGuys buffing up at\nethos, girls dieting, guys\ndieting, girls buffing\nup at ethos, we do it all\nto be more attractive.\nThat\u2019s true: we biologically want to reproduce.\nOur generation likes\nreferring to it as \u2019being\nhorny,\u2019 but we\u2019re smart,\nevolved creatures too,\nwho can control primal\nbiological needs with\nthis mysterious thing\ncalled reason (also\nreferred to as common\nsense, education or\nnormalcy). I was\nangry, it didn\u2019t mean I\npunched anyone, I was\nsad and disappointed, it\ndidn\u2019t mean I cried or\nshouted. The same way\nthat just because you\nlike someone you don\u2019t\nhave sex in the middle\nof the freaking hallway.\nThe same way that just\nbecause you \u2019think\u2019\nit is manlier to be the\nprovider doesn\u2019t mean\nyou\u2019re emasculated by\nhaving a successful\nwife! I mean, watch the\nIntern! Anything wrong\nwith a stay at home dad?\nLet\u2019s speak the truth,\nboys and girls, we\u2019re\nall at fault here! We\ndon\u2019t have to be sheep.\nBut I mean feel free to\nwrap yourself in curly\nwhite wool and move to\na field of grass and do\nwhat all the others do.\nWell... What the fuck.\nWe can do better. It\u2019s not\neven about rights, re-sponsibilities, choices,\nfreedoms, whatever.\nIt\u2019s about respect. For\nyourself, for others,\nthose who are like and\nunlike you, those who\ncame before and fought\nfor change, those who\ncome now and fight\nfor change, those who\nwill come to fight for\nchange. Because things\nare never fine, they\nnever will be. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean we stop\nmaking them better, and\na little less bad.\n\n"

The murder of Jamal\nKhashoggi reveals the dangers that journalists face everywhere.\nPOLITICS\nJuan Ignacio Rubio\nPolitics Editor\nI\nn 1170, four English\nknights murdered\nthe archbishop of\nCanterbury, Thomas\nBeckett, following the\norders of king Henry\nII. The assassination of\nBeckett had ramifications\nthat reached continental\nEurope, and less than two\nyears after his death he\nwas declared a saint by\nthe Church. Henry had to\npublicly repent, and the\nmurderers were exiled\nto the Holy Land. The\nworship of St. Thomas of\nCanterbury grew strong\namong Christians, who\nsaw him as the poor\nvictim of a ruthless ruler.\nHe became a symbol, a\nmartyr of a bigger cause.\nWhat does this have to\ndo with Jamal Khashoggi,\na Saudi journalist born\n788 years after the murder\nof Beckett? To understand\nthe relationship, we have\nto explore the life of a\nman that had to endure\nthroughout his life the\ntension of being a critical\nvoice of the Saudi establishment while coming\nfrom an elite family\nhimself. A life that was\ncut short in a dark room in\nTurkey on October 2nd.\nJamal Khashoggi\u2019s\nfamily was deeply linked\nto not only the Saudi\nroyalty, but to the master\nclasses of the whole\nMiddle East. His uncle\nwas the infamous arms\ndealer Adnan Khashoggi,\nand among his cousins\none could count Dodi\nal-Fayed, the tragical\ncompanion of lady Diana\nSpencer. During his university years, he joined\nthe Muslim Brotherhood,\na political and religious\ngroup that defended a\nvery rigorist interpretation\nof Sunni Islam. There he\nbefriended Osama bin\nLaden, and defended him\nwhen the future Al Qaeda\nleader went to Afghanistan to fight alongside the\nMujahedeen against the\nSoviet army.\nLater, he moderated\nto more liberal positions.\nA talented journalist, he\nworked with the reformist media of the Saudi\nkingdom, taking important editorial positions in\ndiaries such as Al Watan,\nwhere he achieved the post\nof editor in chief. He was\nhowever under constant\npressure, as the more\nconservative elements\nin the Saudi government\nwere displeased by his\ncriticism of the extreme\nreligious policies of the\nstate. Khashoggi was also\ncritical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s\naction in the Yemen\nWar, which has led to a\nfamine that is threatening\nthe lives of millions of\npeople. He also opposed\nthe attempts to isolate\nQatar from other Muslim\nnations that the Saudi\ngovernment enacted after\nthe schism between the\ntwo countries in 2016, and\nadvocated Saudi women\u2019s\nrights. Thus, he was\nincreasingly becoming\na thorn in the House of\nSaud\u2019s side, and one of the\nbiggest foes of the power\nbehind the throne in the\ncountry, Crown Prince\nand Defence Minister\nMohammad bin Salman.\nHe became a bigger threat\nwhen his international\nprofile started to rise as he\nwas hired as columnist by\nthe Washington Post.\nHe had become too\ndangerous and soon the\ntrap was set. Khashoggi\nintended to marry a\nTurkish national, and in\norder to do so he had to\nobtain a set of documents\nfrom the Saudi consulate\nin Istanbul. It is not clear\nwhat happened once he\nstepped into the building.\nWe know he was killed,\nbecause the Saudi state\nhas admitted it after two\nweeks of waffling. It is\nstrongly suspected that\nhe was murdered in an\nextremely macabre way,\ninvolving tortures and\ndismemberment with a\nbone saw while he was\nalive. He was to become\na warning to other dissi-dents, a reminder of the\nfate faced by those who\ndon\u2019t toe the line of the\nstate.\nBut the action back-fired. Ironically, by\nremoving one of the\nvoices that denounced\nthe corruption and crimes\nof the Saudi government,\nthe perpetrators have\nattracted the attention of\nthe mainstream Western\nmedia, that had till then\nnot given much attention\nto the foreign policies of\nthe kingdom. Khashoggi\nhas become the face of\nSaudi oppression, of the\nmassacres in Yemen, of\nthe plight that the female\nSaudis have to endure\nevery day.\nEuropean governments\nhave started taking action,\nwith Germany leading the\nway to stop the trading of\nweapons to the country.\nThe involvement of\nelements of the Saudi state\nhas become more and\nmore clear, as the suspects\nof carrying out the assassination have been\nidentified as members\nof Bin Salman\u2019s closest\ncircle. The evidence was\nstill denied by Saudi\nArabia, which argued for\ntwo weeks that Khashoggi\nhad disappeared after\nleaving the consulate.\nThey had the support of\nDonald Trump, who has\nnever hidden his disdain\nfor the free press and his\ncosiness to the House of\nSaud. But not even the\nbacking of the American\ngovernment was enough\nto hide the truth. Saudi\nArabia admitted that\nKashoggi died, though\naccording to their version\nof the story it was following a brawl between him\nand the Saudi consul. The\nlatest line of defence is\nblaming the crime on the\n\u201cA talented\njournalist, he\nworked with\nthe reformist\nmedia of\nthe Saudi\nkingdom.\u201d\nSaudi legation, insisting\nthat the Saudi government\nhad nothing to do with the\nmurder.\nIs Jamal Kashoggi\na modern day Thomas\nBeckett? The killing of\nBeckett caused such an\noutrage that it forced\nthe king of England to\nissue a public apology. It\nprovoked universal condemnation in medieval\nEurope, and the kingdom\nwas in risk of complete\nisolation for a time. Centuries have happened since\nthen, centuries that have\nseen massive advances\nin human rights and the\nrule of law. While our\ngovernments comply with\nthe march of progress? Or\ninstead, will they ignore\nthe matter in the long\nterm, proving that they\nhave lower standards than\nthe feudal monarchies of\nEurope. Time will tell.\nUntil then, we aspiring\njournalists can only mourn\nthe life and work of a man\nthat stood against powers\nthat wanting him gone,\nand achieved so in the\nmost gruesome fashion.\nAssalaamu \u2018alaykum wa-rahmatullah.\nA journalist that said too much.// Wikimedia\n\u201cIt is strongly\nsuspected that\nhe was killed in\nan extremely\nmacabre way,\ninvolving\ntorture and\ndisection\nwith a bone\nsaw while he\nwas still alive.\u201d\n\n"

That\u2019s the story of\nCharles Darwin and his\nhistoric odyssey on the\nHMS Beagle \u2013 a fantastic\ntale that receives an enthralling dramatisation in\nThe Wider Earth.\nThe Wider Earth takes\nus back to an age of\ndiscovery and uncharted\nwaters. The coastlines\nwere yet to be fully\nmapped. Photography\nwas not yet invented. The\ntectonic movement of the\nEarth\u2019s crust remained but\nan inkling in the writings\nof Charles Lyell. And as\nfor living creatures? Few\nwould dare challenge the\nbiblical view that God\nhad created each living\nbeing in its present form.\nIt was in this scientific\nand religious climate that\nHMS Beagle set sail, with\none enterprising naturalist\non board.\nThe production, envisioned by the Australian\ntheatre company Dead\nPuppet Society, is a\nmasterpiece of digital\nanimation, soundscape,\npuppetry and traditional\ntheatre. Most of the action\ntakes place atop a large\nrevolving wooden struc-ture, which undergoes a\nbreathtaking number of\ntransformations: from\nbarren rock to Brazilian\nrainforest, from a stuffy\nlibrary at Oxford to the\nstorm-tossed deck of\nHMS Beagle. This is\nmade possible by a wide\nscreen running overhead\nacross the stage, on which\nstunning moving backdrops are depicted \u2013 watercolours of the rolling\nEnglish countryside;\nmaps tracking the journey\nof the Beagle; thunder-storms, volcanic erup-tions, deserts and oceans.\nLighting and sound effects\nmatch the backdrops with\nprecise timing \u2013 a flash of\nlightning is accompanied\nby thunder rumbling\nthroughout the theatre,\nimmersing the audience\nwithin the scene.\nHowever, the most\nunique feature of the production is the inclusion\nof over 30 extraordinary\npuppets, showcasing the\ndiverse animals Darwin\nsaw on his voyage. From\na skittish iguana to two\nponderous Galapagos\ntortoises, the mobile\npuppets are operated\nCast of The Wider Earth // Mark Douet\nYoung Darwin\u2019s odyssey brought to life.\nBeagle. While admirable,\nthis attempt at meaningful\npolitical and social commentary seems somewhat\nout of place. Despite\nbeing based on real events\nand people, the characters\nof the play come across\nas quite one-dimensional.\nDarwin, for instance, is\nplayed with unrelenting\nenthusiasm by Bradley\nFoster, who depicts the\nyoung naturalist as the\nwith lifelike skill by the\nseven-person cast and add\nyet another dimension of\nreality to the multilayered\nscenes. Looking at the\njewel-coloured butterflies\nfluttering around the rain-forest, or the odd shape\nof a duck-billed platypus,\none can almost begin to\nunderstand how awe-in-spiring it must have been\nto encounter these creatures for the first time.\nIn addition to showing\noff the wonders of the\nnatural world, another\ntheme heavily explored\nin The Wider Earth is the\nconflict between accepted\nChristian beliefs and the\nimplications of Darwin\u2019s\nbudding theories. Darwin,\nwho was originally slated\nto become a pastor on his\nreturn from the voyage,\nstruggles internally\nagainst his own religious\nbeliefs and externally\nagainst proponents\nof Christian dogma,\nrepresented by Captain\nFitzroy and Christian\nmissionaries on board the\nstereotypically idealistic,\nenterprising adventurer.\nThis stylised version\nof Darwin, however, is\nsufficient to convey the\nmessage of scientific\ncuriosity and sheer wide-eyed wonder that makes\nThe Wider Earth such a\nmagical experience.\nDarwin\u2019s theory\nopened a path to new scientific discovery. Since\nhis time, great leaps and\nstrides have been made in\nour understanding of life\nand the natural phenomena on earth. Yet with\nall our technological and\nscientific progress, there\nis often a sense of fatigue\n\u2013 the idea that we are\nmaking only incremental\nprogress on theories that\nwereestablishedcenturies\nago.

    "content": "ISSUE 1702\nFELIX\n7\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nHow to avoid a mess like Brexit: let\u2019s adopt\na new voting system\nThecontradictionsinourelectoraltraditionshaveonlybecomestrongersincethereferendum.\nHere is a modest proposal that could help to solve the issue.\nPOLITICS\nDivyen\nSince the Brexit\nreferendum we\u2019ve seen\nBrexit come to dominate\nBritish politics. It has\nbeen incredibly divisive\nand has created more\nproblems than it has\nsolved. It has sent both\nof the major political\nparties into turmoil. We\nneed to ask ourselves\nhow we got here and\nmore importantly how\ncan we avoid this kind\nof anarchy in future.\nThe fundamental\nproblem of Brexit is\nthat there is a clear\ndisconnect between the\nMembers of Parliament\nwho are meant to represent us, and the will\nof the people. The vast\nmajority of MPs are\nnatural remainers and\nyet the public voted\nto leave the EU. This\nrepresents an obvious\nflaw in the system and\nDavid Cameron tried to\nfix this by way of a ref-erendum. This evidently\nhasn\u2019t worked and one\nof the reasons why is\nbecause the UK system\nisn\u2019t geared towards\nreferendums. Referendums introduce another\nmandate which can and\nwill come into conflict\nwith the mandate that\nMPs gain when they are\nelected to the Commons.\nThis can be seen now\nas remainers in the\nCommons are being\nforced to enact something they see as fundamentally wrong and\ndamaging to the country.\nThis is a complete\nanathema under a Parliamentary system and\nwill ultimately lead to\nan outcome that nobody\nwill be particularly\nhappy with. For this\nreason, it\u2019s best to avoid\nreferendums and leave it\nto those who we elect to\nmake decisions on our\nbehalf which is precisely their job.\nThere must be another\nway to avoid this kind\nof problem arising in\nthe first place. The\nsimplest solution would\nbe to make sure there is\na far better correlation\nbetween the views that\nare held by the general\npublic and the views\nthat are held within\nParliament. This is obviously the best way for\na democracy to function.\nHowever, under the\ncurrent UK system\nthis currently doesn\u2019t\nhappen.\nThe system used at\nthe moment is first past\nthe post (FPTP) where\nthe country is split into\ntiny constituencies and\neach constituency elects\none person to represent\nthem in Parliament.\nThis has some benefits\nsuch as ensuring a local\nconstituency link so that\nlocal problems can be\nraised and dealt with\nat a national level. The\nsystem also increases\nthe chances of a single\nparty gaining a majority\ndue to a landslide effect\nwhich in turn should\nallow for the formation\nof a strong and stable\ngovernment, as Theresa\nMay would say. The\nlandslide effect means\nthat the larger parties get\na dividend for getting a\nhigher percentage of the\nnational vote. A simple\nthought experiment\ndemonstrates this; if\nevery constituency voted\n51% for party A and 49%\nfor party B then their\nnational shares would\nbe 51% and 49% respec-tively. However, party A\nwould win 100% of the\nseats and B none. Whilst\nexaggerated this demonstrates the fundamental\nproblem that parties\nthat have a large share\nof the vote will win in a\nhigher number of seats\nat a local level and this\ncan be seen in the 2015\nelection where the SNP\ngot just over 50% of the\nvote in Scotland and yet\ntook 56/59 seats. This is\nclearly entirely undemocratic and a poor way\nof running a country. It\nalso means that minor\nparties such as the Lib\nDems, the Greens and\nUKIP get far fewer seats\nthan they deserve. Even\nif one doesn\u2019t agree with\ntheir politics they still\ndeserve fair representa-tion.\nIt is now time to reconsider voting reform.\nThere are several\nmodels that would lead\nto far more satisfactory\noutcomes. One of these\nis the single transferra-ble vote (STV) system.\nThis system works by\nelecting multiple representatives to represent\none area. On the ballot\nyou list the candidates in\nyour order of preference\nand then candidates\nthat get above a set\nthreshold (i.e. a fifth of\nthe vote if 5 candidates\nare to be elected) and\nany additional votes are\ntransferred to second\npreferences. If at any\npoint no more candidates\nhave crossed the threshold the candidate with\nthe lowest vote share is\nremoved and their votes\nare redistributed based\non next preference.\nThis system has some\nkey advantages. It will\nlead to a far more proportional representation\nof the popular vote and\nmaintain the constituency link. Further,\nif you believe one of\nyour MP is not doing a\ngood job of representing\nyour interests then there\nare other local MPs\nwho should represent\nyou. STV would be far\nbetter at dealing with an\nissue like Brexit which\nhas caused internal\n\u201cBrexit\nhas been\nincredibly\ndivisive and\nhas created\nmore problems\nthan it has\nsolved\u201d\ndivisions within both\nparties. Parties are able\nto stand multiple candidates in one area under\nSTV; therefore, they\ncould stand a leaver and\na remainer and leave it\nto the public to decide\nwhich candidate/opinion\nthey prefer leading to a\nfar better representation\nof people\u2019s views in\nParliament.\nBrexit has been an\nissue which has divided\nboth parties for decades\nand it is time that we\nintroduced a system\nthat can cope with it.\nThe public have a right\nto have their voices\nheard and referendums\nclearly don\u2019t work\neither. The time has\ncome to abandon FPTP\nand to bring in STV as\nour voting system for\ngeneral elections.\nVoting could become a more efficient process // Wikimedia\n\u201cBrexit has\nbeen an issue\nthat has\ndivided both\nparties for\ndecades and\nit is time that\nwe introduce\na system that\ncan cope with\nit !\u201d\nVanniasegaram\nPolitics Editor\n\n"

How do we choose between a juicy burger and\nmouth-watering lasagne? How do we figure out how much of this tempting apple pie is enough?\nSCIENCE\nPaula Rowi\u0144ska\nScience Writer\nN\neuroscientists\nfrom Johns\nH o p k i n s\nU n i v e r s i t y\nstudied how our brains\nhelp us make spontaneous\nfood choices at buffets, in\nrestaurants or in front of\nour own fridge. The research on rats helped them\nidentify a brain region\nthat could be responsible\nfor our food decisions,\naccording to the paper in\nNature Communications.\nResearchers offered the\nrats two types of sugary\ndrinks: one sweetened\nwith sucrose and one with\nmaltodextrin. Rodents got\nmuch more excited when\ngiven the first option:\nthey licked it faster.\nPeople react similarly to\ndelicious food, \u201cthe dish\nthat\u2019s the favourite will\nlikely be eaten faster and\nwith bigger bites\u201d, says\nDavid Ottenheimer, the\nlead author of the paper.\nFor a few days the team\nfrom Johns Hopkins University gave the rats one\nof the two sweet drinks.\nResearchers monitored\ntheir brain activity to\nunderstand which neurons\nget activated when rats\nrealised which treat they\nreceived. They registered\nincreased activity in the\nventral pallidum, one of\nthe pleasure centres of the\nbrain, whenever rodents\ngot excited about sucrose\nand disappointed about\nmaltodextrin.\nIn the second part\nof the study the rats\nwere offered either the\npreviously less-desirable\nmaltodextrin drink or just\nplain water. This time\nthe activity in the ventral\npallidum when animals\nreceived the sweetened\ndrink resembled their\nreaction to sucrose drink\nin the first part of the study.\n\u201cFood choices\nare likely to\ndepend on\nthe context:\nrats picked the\nbest option\navailable.\u201d\nThe researchers concluded that food choices are\nlikely to depend on the\ncontext: rats picked the\nbest option available.\nNeuroscientists still do\nnot fully understand the\npurpose of such ventral\npallidum\u2019s activity. According to one hypothesis,\nit is supposed to reinforce\nour current food choices.\nJust remember: when you eat too many sweets this Halloween, it\u2019s all the ventral pallidum\u2019s fault... // Wikimedia\n\u201cThey\nregistered\nincreased\nactivity in\nthe ventral\npalladium...\nwhenever\nrodents got\nexcited.\u201d\nbe exciting in one scenario\nand disappointing in\nanother, ventral pallidum\ncould be the key.\u201d\nThis study could be\nthe first step to new\ntreatments encouraging\nhealthy eating. For now, if\nyou eat a bit too much at\nthe upcoming Halloween\nparty, you can blame your\nventral pallidum.\nAlternatively, it could\nencourage us to pick one\ntype of food over another\nin the future.\n\u201cOur data suggest that\nfurther investigation of\nventral pallidum will be\ncritical for understanding\nhow we make decisions\nabout eating,\u201d claims Ottenheimer. \u201cIf we want to\nfigure out why a food can\nHi!

Increasing the\ninterest rates directly\nincreases the yield on\nthe cash it holds, and the\nproceeds go directly into\nthe income statement.\nFurthermore, interest rate\nhikes tend to occur in\nenvironments where economic growth is strong\nand consumer and corporate demand for loans\nspikes. It is not surprising\nthat with the current strong\neconomic climate in the\nUSA, powered by the\ntax cuts imposed by the\nTrump administration in\naddition to the recent rate\nhike by the Fed, that bulge\nbracket banks are starting\nto reap the rewards. One\nclear example of this is\nGoldman Sachs. The bank\nreported $6.28 earnings\nper share (EPS) exceeding\nthe $5.38 analyst estimate,\nwith revenue exceeding\n$8.4 billion estimate\ncoming in at $8.65 billion.\nThe business had benefited strongly from high\ndemand for initial public\nofferings (IPO), where\nrevenues for equities\nunderwriting had more\nthan doubled and fears\nthat fixed-income would\nbe hit were cushioned by\nhigher revenues from FX\nand commodity trading.\nDavid Solomon, CEO\nwho took over on 1 Oct,\nis also broadening the\nbanking and trading client\nbase, finding growth in\nsmaller markets including\npushing into retail bank-ing. Marcus, the new retail\nbanking arm of Goldman\nSachs, hit the UK high\nstreets earlier last month\nand it has been announced\nnumber of millionaires\ngenerated record profits\nof \u20ac15.4 billion for 111\nprivate banks in western\nEurope, with an annual\nincrease of 14.1%\naccording to McKinsey\nthe consultancy. UBS,\nthe main player globally\nin private wealth\nmanagement, reported\nthat adjusted pre-tax\nprofits for its non-US\nwealth operations rose\nby 15%. Compare this to\nBlackRock (the world\u2019s\nlargest asset manager with\nmore than $6 trillion of\nassets under management\nbased in the States)\nwhose shares plummeted\nafter its long-term net\nflows- a measure of how\nmuch money investors\nare handing it, excluding\nmore short term volatile\ncash management\nvehicles- have hit a two\nyear low. BlackRock CEO\nLarry Fink, laid the blame\non choppier financial\nconditions, which have\ncaused investors to scale\nback their exposure\nto the market saying,\n\u201cDivergence in monetary\npolicy and macro and\ngeopolitical uncertainty\ncontinues to impact\ninvestor sentiment and\nour financial markets,\nleading clients to reduce\nrisk in their portfolios\u201d.\nHowever, BlackRock\nis facing a seismic\nlonger-term shift in the\ninvestment industry. The\nglobal asset management\nindustry is facing\nintensifying pressure from\ncheap, index tracking\nfunds, which have drawn\nhundreds of billions of\ndollars since the financial\ncrisis.\nI think, however, this\nshows what all investors\nthat it will merge with\nits investment management unit. Solomon\nclaims the new division\nwill launch a \u201cbroader\nwealth-management offering combining Marcus\u2019\ndigital capabilities with\nthe more established sales\nchannels and products\ncurrently housed within\nthe investment management division\u201d.\nOn the other side of\nthe Atlantic, European\nbanks have also recorded\nstrong growth. Barclays\npublished third quarter\nresults with revenues\nfrom equities and fixed-income trading up by\nalmost a fifth. Jes Staley,\nBarclays Chief Executive,\nsaid \u201cThere has been a\ncomment that European\ninvestment banks can\u2019t\ncompete with the US,\nand I would just point\nout that for four quarters\nin a row we have gained\nmarket share\u201d. The strong\nperformance of Barclay\u2019s\ntrading desks compared\nwell with the larger banks\nlike Goldman and Morgan\nStanley, but its revenues\nare still dwarfed by its US\nrivals. However, it looks\nlike European private\nbanks are the highlight.\nSelling lucrative\nproducts and services\nto the world\u2019s growing\nGoldman Sachs quarter 3 earnings exceeded analysts expectation// Daily Crypto\nTrading revenues at bulge bracket banks have increased in 2018 // Financial Times\nInvestment banks relish in hawkish environment\nare worried about at the\nmoment. The business\ncycle peaking. Despite\nstrong growth results\nthere is an underlying\nrealisation that this is no\nlonger sustainable, and\nthat this is as good as it\ngets. What is worrying\nis that the debt load for\nUS corporations has\nreached a record $6.3\ntrillion, with increasing\nyields and what looks like\nchoppy waters ahead will\neveryone be able to meet\ntheir liabilities?\n\n"

Ben\nclaims to have never shed\na tear, and hardly feels\nsadness; he drives a fancy\nsportscar and lives in a\nluxurious apartment, yet\ndoesn\u2019t seem to work;\nhe smokes weed and\nburns greenhouses for\nfun \u2013 one every 2 months\nis his optimum \u2018pace\u2019.\nWhen Haemi suddenly\nvanishes without trace,\nJong-su wonders if Ben\nhas anything to do with\nher disappearance.\nBurning is a reim-agining of the Haruki\nMurakami short story,\nBarn Burning \u2013 the\nfilm takes liberties with\nthe original plot, but\nMurakami\u2019s sombre and\nmelancholic tone survives\nin the already bittersweet\ntale. This adaptation is\nrealised with modern\nnoir-thriller elements;\ntraces of psychopathy,\ndistrust, the unreliable\nnarrator play a big part\nin this film. Moments of\ntension are done effectively \u2013 characters merely\ntalking to each other\nbecome an increasingly\nuncomfortable watch. We\nexpect something to snap\nand the gears to grind into\nplace but it never happens\nin the way we expect. The\nfilm is like a pot full to\nthe brim of water, slowly\ncoming to the boil from a\nlow heat \u2013 before someone\ncomes and turns it off to\nstop it overflowing. It\nliberally takes its time to\nbreathe and ponder, and\nkeeps its cards close to its\nchest throughout; when\nthe moment did come,\nBurning finally revealed\nwhat kind of a film it\nreally is. It subverted my\nexpectations, but not in a\nwholly satisfying manner.\nIn some respects, you\ncould read the film as\na straightforward psychological thriller, but\nit clearly sets its target\nhigher than that. The cinematography for a start,\nis unusual for a noir: its\nmuted pastel tones and\nnatural lighting supports\nits realism, as well as\nemploying a hypnotic\ngaze, especially when\nthe frame dances around\nthe cursed freedom that\nHaemi embodies. Focus\nis tight and intimate on\nthe characters, rarely on\ntheir surroundings, and\n\u201cTop TEN pranks gone wrong gone SEXUAL\u201d// IMDb\nFILM\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Editor\nDir: Lee Chang-dong\nScript: Lee Chang-dong,\nOh Jumg-mi . Starring: Yoo\nAh-in, Jeon Jong-su, Steven\nYeun. 148 minutes\nBURNING\nso succeeds in making the\nmodern Korean landscape\nas big but isolating as\npossible with the limited\ncast. A short motif score\nof a deep bass and hand\ndrums weaves back and\nforth into the story, but\nwhere it is most effective is the silence it lets\noccupy in the scene \u2013 it\u2019s\nsound design done with\nconfidence. Burning takes\na naturalistic approach\nin its production, in line\nwith its central debate of\nwhat\u2019s real and not.\nMany Korean films,\nare rooted in politics and\nBurning is no exception.\nTrump is on the news\nchannel while the protagonist urinates; it\u2019s set in\nPaju,neartheDMZ,where\nNorth Korean propaganda\nbroadcasts chirp in the\nbackground of the sleepy\ncountryside; it talks of the\nrising levels of youth un-employment, while highlighting misogyny and\nmistreatment of women,\nclassism, and hereditary\npersonality traits. While it\nnever succeeds to fully integrate coherent points on\nthese issues into the main\nbody of the film, you can\neasily interpret the finale\nas something other than\nliteral.\nI enjoyed Burning\nthoroughly; it was never\nboring or dull, keeping\nme on my toes until it\nrevealed itself, albeit with\na whimper. Steven Yeun\ngives an impressively\nmeasured performance,\nJeon Jong-seo confidently\nexpresses the melancholia\nof her character, and while\nYoo Ah-in plays to our\nsympathies, his character\nis mostly unlikeable. It\u2019s\neasy to lose yourself in\nthe frame and let the entrancing current take you\non this trip of reflection.\n\n"

The\nuniversal sign of an upcoming hill climb.\nThe BUCS Hill Climb,\nheld this year on the\ninfamous Mam Tor in the\nPeak District, marked the\nend of the road season for\nthe cycling club. People\noften question whether it\nis worth driving 4 hours\neach way for a 6-minute\nrace and, to be honest,\nso we were as we set\noff at 7am. A journey\nmade worse by the fact\nwe couldn\u2019t eat (some\ndubious physics from\nMarcus suggested 100g\nin weight cost 1s on the\nclimb).\nMorale was low and the\nsigns for Woburn Safari\nPark were tempting but it\nonly opened at 10am so\nwe pressed on. Finally the\nclimb crept into view and\nthe mood was summed up\nby Jack who said, \u201cThat\nlooks quite big\u201d. We\nthought this would be a\ngood time to start getting\nthe excuses in and moaned\nabout how Sheffield\nUniversity had an unfair\nadvantage having this on\ntheir doorstep while we\nhave Exhibition Road.\nWe went for a quick\nrecce of the climb which\ndidn\u2019t tell us much we\ndidn\u2019t already know from\nsome extensive street-view-based research the\nnight before. There was\na 18% ramp straight out\nof the start gate, with the\ngradient easing off (by\neasing off we\u2019re talking\nsingle-figure gradient)\nwith the gradient kicking\nto 12% again for a brutal\nmid-section before a\ncouple of hairpins into the\nfinish. Overall stats were\n2.2km at 10% (think Box\nHill but twice as steep) \u2013\nin essence it starts hard\nand gets harder.\nWe headed back to the\nminibus and talked very\nloudly about tactics and\npower numbers to give off\na vibe that we knew what\nwe were doing.\nRoy Miles was the\nfirst rider off for Imperial\nsetting a very quick early\ntime of 7:51, next was\nJulian who clocked 10:35,\nthen Zach at 10:02. Alex\nwas next off stopping\nthe clock at 8:32; at 6\u20193\nAlex was always fighting\na losing battle against\ngravity but averaged\na huge 380W up the\nclimb \u2013 definitely one to\nwatch in the time trials.\nJack Hagger, who had an\nincredibly detailed pow-er-based pacing strategy,\nwas understandably\ngutted to see his power\nmeter decide to re-cali-brate itself on the start line\nthough he still managed\nto clock an incredibly\nimpressive 7:26.\nThere had been a huge\namount of competition\nbetween Imperial\u2019s final\nthree riders (Alan Slatter,\nJohn Shroff and Marcus\nHalson) - beginning on\nthe recent training camp\nto Girona. With one win\napiece in their previous\nthree hill climbs this was\nvery much the decider\nas the last race of the\nseason, and their last hill\nclimb for ICCC. Form\nwas looking good with\nall three clocking Box\nHill PB\u2019s (the universally\naccepted form indicator)\nin the week leading up to\nthe event.\nMarcus was first off\nand, despite making\nit abundantly clear to\nanyone he spoke to that\nthis \u201cwasn\u2019t his sort of\nhill\u201d, clocked a 7:31. Alan\nSlatter was next and on\nthe legendary pink bike\ncould be spotted a long\nway off. Worryingly for\nMarcus he seemed to be\ngoing quite well and he\ncrossed the line in 7:13 \u2013\na standout performance.\nJohn was last off for\nImperial and, after a solid\nride in the hill climb last\nyear, was amongst the\nbig-hitters at the business\nend of the event. Aided\nby some huge cheers from\nthe rest of the team he also\nstopped the clock in 7:31\n(later confirmed to be an\nall-important 0.3s behind\nMarcus).\nThe standard of the\nevent is always very\nhigh, and this year\nwas no exception. The\nwinning time of 6:12 at\nan astonishing average\nspeed on 18.7km/h was a\nnew course record on a\nclimb that has previously\nbeen used for the national\nchampionships.\nPost-race comprised a\nlot of calories and excuses\nand in the manner of Liverpool fans we all agreed\nthat next year would be\nour year. Morale was\nbuoyed slightly by seeing\nthat a UCL rider had\ncome last. We went over\nto offer our condolences\nand ended up getting\nroped into taking one of\ntheir riders back after\nthey\u2019d forgotten to book\ntransport for the return\nleg. The invoice is on the\nway to UCL as we speak.\nIt\u2019s been an incredibly\nsuccessful year for the\nclub. There have been ups,\nsuch as Matt Langworthy\nwinning the BUCS 10\nmile TT, and downs such\nas missing out on the\nglory, and more importantly the \u00a3160 each, of\nwinning the Catford and\nBec Team prize by the\nmerest of margins but\nwe\u2019ll be heading into the\noff season with morale\nhigh ready to push on for\nnext year.\nImperial\u2019s fastest club on two wheels journeys to the oldest bike race in the world\nJohn, Marcus, Alan and Jack at the Catford CC Hill Climb - the oldest bike race in the world // ICCC\nICCC captain John gurning his way to the top // ICCC\nImperial College Lawn Tennis Club heads to Nice for\nsummer tour!\nNice. Very nice indeed.\nSPORTS\nArnaud Legrand,\nDiego Vargas Ortiz,\nBartu Akcaba, and\nPhilip Mogul\nIC Lawn Tennis Members\nT\nhis summer we\nset out to Nice,\nFrance, for our\nsummer tour.\nAiming to experience\nclay-court tennis (a surface we never get to play\non in London) we took\nthis opportunity to spend\nsome time together after a\nsuccessful season.\nThe excitement to play\non the top-quality clay\ncourts in Nice was clear as\nsoon as squad assembled\nat around 9am at Liverpool Street station. But\nthat had to wait, the first\nstop was the Spoons at\nStansted Airport for a pre-flight breakfast. Shout-out\nto the beloved President\nfor being late, thankfully\nwe didn\u2019t miss our flight!\nAdvice to anyone heading\nto Nice, don\u2019t sleep on the\nplane unlike most of us -the landing is spectacular.\nWith the French sun\nshowing its might instant-ly, the team took a bus to\nthe city centre and walked\ndown to the hostel. After\nsome time to relax, Nice\nwas all up for exploring\nbut it wasn\u2019t long before\na hungry bunch of tennis\nplayers wanted to devour\nsome traditional French\nfood. The night carried\nfar after dinner - and what\nbetter way to end it than a\ndip in the Mediterranean\nin the early hours of the\nmorning.\nOn Saturday, southern\nFrench sunshine filled the\nhostel, and we rose up and\nheaded to breakfast. This\nwas followed by a trip to\nNice\u2019s beautiful castle.\nThe team were doubtful it\n\u201cShout-out to\nthe beloved\nPresident for\nbeing late,\nthankfully we\ndidn\u2019t miss our\nflight!\u201d\n\u201cShout-out\nto James\nfor serving\ninto Bartu\u2019s\nhead during\ndoubles\u201d\nwould be worth the steep\nclimb to top of the hill,\nbut the views proved them\nwrong. What followed\nwas a little promenade\naround the gardens, waterfalls and gorgeous views\nof the Mediterranean. On\nthe way back to the hostel,\neveryone was delighted to\ntry Socca, a type of crepe\nmade from chickpea flour\nnative to Nice.\nAs soon as the team\nmade it to the hostel it\nwas time to bash some\ntennis balls. Flip-flops\nwere switched for tennis\nshoes, rackets were\ngathered and heads turned\nwest towards the Nice\nLawn Tennis Club. The\nscorching sunshine did\nnot stop the fierce tennis\nlovers from enjoying two\nfull hours of clay-court\ntennis as everyone got to\nhit with each other. Shout\nout to James for serving\ninto Bartu\u2019s head during\ndoubles. As the whole\nsquad was on the verge of\na heat stroke by the time\ntennis was finished, it was\ntime to hit the beach once\nagain.\nAs the sun set over\nthe French Riviera, the\nclay covered shoes were\ndusted off and shirts were\nworn. The night continued\nas the crew embarked on a\nbar crawl around Nice; the\ndetails of which won\u2019t be\ndiscussed to preserve the\ndignity of certain (all?)\nmembers.\nAs we began the final\nmorning, the sun forced its\nrays through the shuttered\nwindows of the hostel\ndorms. No one stirred:\nthey slumbered on through\nthe first hours of the day.\nAs a few of the chaps\nstarted to slowly wake\nup, heavy-lidded eyes\nwere slowly prised open,\nand hands gently rubbed\nthrobbing heads and\nroiling stomachs. Others\nlay completely still, heads\nheavily slumped against\nthe sides of bins, unwilling to move lest the world\nstart spinning anew. A soft\nstutter escaped from the\nlips of one slumping form:\n\u201cTotally worth it\u201d.\nThe group eventually\nmoved - the tennis courts\nwere booked for 2pm after\nall! On court, movements\nstarted sluggish, weak,\npitiful. But, as the team\nrecovered, the hits gained\nin strength and vigour (if\nnot precision) and balls\nwent zooming through\nthe air in yellow streaks,\nfilling the air with the\ncomforting sounds of\nrhythmic tennis rallying.\nSoon, however, the squad\nfound themselves tiring:\nlegs were slogging,\nshoulders were slumping,\nfeet were dragging on the\nrich red clay of the French\ntennis courts. Needless\nto say, the French were\nthoroughly impressed by\nour grand display!\nFollowing training,\nthe group went for a last\nquick swim in the sea\nand sunbathed, clearly\nuncomfortable on the\npebble beach but too lazy\nto move. The evening\nslowly reared its head and\nthe team finally decided\nto wander the city for a\nwell-deserved last meal in\nFrance. And what better\nto enjoy in this country\nof exquisite local cuisine\nthan a pineapple pizza\nfresh from the oven (the\nman was looked down\nupon and sentenced to an\nevening of judgmental\nlooks).\nAnd thus our trip ended\nhere: the team dashing\nthrough town to grab\ntheir taxis, leaving for\nthe airport, and bellies\nwobbling with their last\nmeal. They accomplished\ntheir mission and brought\nto Nice the best of\nImperial culture: a swirl of\nhigh-performance tennis,\na whole lot of \u201coui-ouis\u201d\nand \u201cOuhlalaaas\u201d, plenty\nof growling stomachs and\nparched throats and, most\nimportantly, a belched\nrendition of Country\nRoads that undoubtedly\nstill reverberates throughout the whole town.\nIf you enjoy playing\ntennis or want to learn\nhow to play, get in touch\nwith us through social\nmedia and we\u2019ll be more\nthan happy to get you\ninvolved in the club - and\nsee you with us next year\nfor our upcoming tour!\nDoesn\u2019t look like a lawn to me... // IC Lawn Tennis\nISSUE 1702\nFELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n39\nSun, sets, and suspicious serves// IC Lawn Tennis\n\n"

The\ninitial reasons provided\nfor cancelling the event,\nwhichhavebeendescribed\nas a \"joke\" by members of\nLeft Forum, were that the\nUnion deemed the event\nto be \"incompatible\"\nwith the society's values.\nHowever, after members\nof Left Forum met with\nthe Union, further reasons\nemerged:\n\"It was too great a risk\nfor the College and the\nUnion, because someone\nmight learn from us how\nto lockpick, then go\nahead and get arrested for\npicking a lock and call us\nout for teaching them, and\nthen newspapers like the\nDaily Mail might pick it\nup.

One thing that\nshould be kept in mind is\nthat there is nothing more\ncertain to cause miserable\nweather than the looming\nadvent of the first cross\ncountry race of the season.\nThis year as the leaves\nturned brown (and wet)\nImperial\u2019s fittest and\nfinest journeyed to North\nLondon for the first in the\nseries of 5 races in the\nLondon Cross Country\nLeague.\nThe grass was definitely slick, but the conditions\n- unlike some races in\nprevious years - were far\nfrom apocaliptic. The\ntrue challenge of the day\nfacing the intrepid ICXC\nrunners was the famous\nParliament Hill, which\nwould need to be tackled\nat least twice by all during\nthe course of the race.\nAfter a hot debate over\nthe route to get to the race\nstart, the runners arrived\nto Hampstead Heath in\ndashing new spikes and\nvests (for those who\nmanaged to snag one\nbefore they sold out!).\nFollowing a brief\n\u201cImperial\n- with over\n50 athletes\n- fielded the\nlargest team of\nany club\u201d\nwarm-up and the traditional chanting on the\nstart line to drown out\nthe health and safety\ninstructions from the\nrace director, the 200-strong crowd of runners\nfrom across the capital\u2019s\nstudent population were\non their way.\nSt. Mary\u2019s (a team\nabsolutely rammed with\ninternational scholarship\ntalent) were on the right\nof the start line, flanking\nthe strong showing from\nImperial who \u2013 with\nover 50 athletes \u2013 fielded\nthe largest men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s teams of any\nclub.\nAs is tradition at the\nannual season opener, all\nthe colleges had selected\ntheir respective \u201cKing of\nthe Hill\u201d contenders.\nThis strange competition involves completely\nruining any prospect of\nhaving a good race for\nthe victim as it involves\nsprinting to get to the top\nof the mammoth first hill\nbefore anyone else.\nInitially it looked like a\nBart\u2019s runner would take\nthe crown, but in the end\nthey were no match for\nImperial\u2019s heroic James\nMillett.

    "content": "ISSUE 1702\nFELIX\n26\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPinter Two: a masterpiece of dialogue and discomfort\nNed Summers\nArts Writer\nI\nf you didn\u2019t know\nthat you were at\nThe Harold Pinter\nTheatre to see \u2018Pinter\nTwo\u2019, a double bill of\nHarold Pinter one-scene\nplays, the monolithic\nstage curtain resembling\na tombstone for PINTER\nwould certainly inform\nyou of that fact. With\nthis introduction, this\nstaging of The Lover and\nThe Collection throws\nitself emphatically into\neverything for which\nPinter is known best. It is\nentirely bizarre, uncomfortable and filled with\nsilences.\nIt is clear why these two\nplays have been chosen to\nbe performed together.\nBoth are wonderful, unsettling examples of the\nfrailty of reality, particularly within interpersonal\nrelationships.\nThe Lover opens with\na husband asking his\nwife with only upbeat\nintrigue, \u2018Is your lover\ncoming today?\u2019. Through\nits twists and pauses, the\nplay delicately paints a\nportrait of the equilibrium of roles between a\ncouple. The bright pink\nset, with flush doors, a\nfold-down bar and an art\ndeco sunburst clock, feels\neerily impersonal; the\nrole of costume further\nstands out in the space.\nThe stage curtain remains\nhalf-closed, leaving it\nfeeling like a sitcom on\na screen but without the\ncanned laughter, just a\nlittle disquieting.\nThe couple played by\nMacmillan and Squires\nmake for an equally uncomfortable centrepiece\nof the performance. As\nthe single act develops,\nthe depth of unexpressed\ntension existing between\nthese two characters\nbecomes clear, and as it\ncomes to a climax, with\ntheir increasingly manic\nattempts through stilted\npauses to find stability,\nit is difficult not to shift\na little uncomfortably\nin your seat through the\nlaughter.\nStill ruminating over\nunsettling questions\nafter the interval, we are\nprojected into a classy,\nposh London; two houses,\none in Belgravia, one\nin Chelsea, coexist on\nthe stage with only one\nconnection point: a black\nrotary phone. Communication, or more precisely\nincommunicability, is\nthe underpinning theme\nin The Collection. An\naffair, a woman\u2019s pride,\na hotel room, sexuality,\nand boredom are the ingredients of this explosive\nstory, whose captivating\nnarration, witty humour,\nand continuous innuendos\nsuccessfully analyse\nthe intricacy of human\nrelations. Written in 1962,\nthis play remains scarily\nrelevant today. No true\nfeeling is ever explicitly\nexpressed, and characters\nregularly refuse to state\nthe crude reality of facts.\nWhat results is a hilarious\ncomedy of errors. Unlike\nThe Lover, the dialogue\nhere is often as playful and\nenergetic as it is witty, and\nDavid Suchet and Russell\nTovey are outstanding as\nthey join Macmillan and\nSquires for a four-person\nact.\nThe Collection, though\njust as full of pauses as\nThe Lover, also has its fair\nshare of longer speeches,\nand Suchet\u2019s silk-robed\nHarry hurls lines with\nvivacity. Suchet shows\nextraordinary control of\ndiction, and, at the same\ntime, showcases Pinter\u2019s\nability as writer. Throughout the performance,\nthis character\u2019s speeches\nare mesmerising and\nRussell Tovey in Pinter Two // Marc Brenner\nOne of the two parts kicking off the Pinter at the Pinter season artfully displays everything that Pinter did so well.\nbetween these characters\nis smaller than between\nSuchet and Tovey, and\nthe choice to ignore that\nis exploited to great\neffect), the play revolves\naround those impacted by\nBill\u2019s carelessness. Tovey\nstretches each action to its\nmaximum, with perfect\nawareness of his physical\npresence. The end result is\na play dripping, in every\naspect, with overt and\ncovert eroticism.\nThe \u2018Pinter at the\nPinter\u2019 is more than a\ncommemorative season\nof one-act plays; it is a\nunique opportunity to\ndelve into the fascinating\nmind of this beloved\nplaywright. Starting now\nuntil February, the theatre\nhosts seven \u2018parts\u2019 or\ndifferent shows, covering\na total of 19 of Pinter\u2019s\nplays, all performed by\nundoubtedly talented and\nwell-known actors. The\nquality of direction and\nthe creative team meet\nthat of the cast. The Jamie\nLloyd Company, thanks\nto the actors\u2019 personal\ntwists and liberties, does\ncomplex. On the other\nhand, Harry\u2019s housemate\nBill, played by Tovey,\nis young, quippy and\nshort. Caught somewhere\nbetween an adolescent\npushing boundaries and\nan adult fully aware of\nhis allure (in the original\nscript, the age gap\na distinguished job, doing\njustice to the complicated analysis which the\nLondon writer carried out\nthroughout his work. In\nPinter Two we see how a\nhigh-level script is complemented by incredible\ntechnical work: from the\nusage of lighting in The\nCollection to create levels\non stage, to that pink set,\nto the prop choices, these\ndetails play a fundamental role in both stories.\nAn honourable mention\nhas to go to the director\nJamie Lloyd himself for\nhis skill in preserving\nand, many times, highlighting the scenic details\nso dear to Harold Pinter.\nAs expected, the cast is\nnothing less than excep-tional: they are able to\nconvey emotions in such\na unique and passionate\nway that it\u2019s impossible to\nremain unmoved by their\ncharacters. Our advice:\nrun to the Harold Pinter\nTheatre and grab a seat,\nyou won\u2019t be let down by\nthis sensational show!\nARTS\nWhere? The Pinter Theatre\nWhen?

Lennon\nhad finally escaped the\nclutches of chronic acid\ntripping, partly due to\nhis burgeoning love for\nYoko Ono, partly due to\nthe retreat the band made\nto Rishikesh where they\nwere meant to have sworn\noff drugs forever in favour\nof transcendental medi-tation. But while the trip\nto India had given them\nnew spiritual \u00e9lan and\ninnumerable new acoustic\nmaterial due to the technological limitations of\nliving in the foothills of\nthe Himalayas, all was not\nwell when they returned\nto the studio. Many of the\nrecording sessions were\ntense, with Lennon and\nMcCartney often pulling\nin opposite directions,\nwhile Ringo even quit the\nband for a short while to\ngo chill out on a boat in\nSardinia (the hiatus yielding one of my favourite\nBeatles songs, \u2018Octopus\u2019s\nGarden\u2019).\nAlthough the spirit\nof The Beatles, their\npenultimate \u201cproper\u201d\nalbum, was borne out of\nthe spirit of revolution,\nthe songs bearing that\nname show that they\nwere not completely in\ntune with what the world\nhad in mind. The French\nstudent protests, MLK\u2019s\ndeath, and the Vietnam\nprotests meant that the\ncounterculture had a new\nurgency which would,\nalmost a decade later, lead\nto the punk counterpunch\nto flower power. But\nLennon\u2019s cheeky treading\non both sides of the issue\n\u201cBut when you talk about\ndestruction // Don\u2019t you\nknow that you can count\nme out (in)\u201d shows that\nthe Beatles were not ready\nto put their full weight\nbehind the aggression\nbrewing in the air. This\nmay have garnered\naccusations from both\nthe radical left \u2013 \u201celitist\nnonchalance in light\nof injustice\u201d \u2013 and the\nradical right \u2013 \u201cMaoists\nin disguise condoning\nthe red apocalypse\u201d \u2013 but\nthey remained unmoved,\nperhaps helped by them\nhaving quit touring. What\nthey would do instead\nof bowing to political\npressures, was produce an\nalbum more varied than\nanything they\u2019d made\nbefore, using it to show\nthat the virtue of music\ncan transcend earthly\nchaos.\nit was, pissing off almost\nas many as Lennon\u2019s\nfamous quip about the\nband being bigger than\nJesus. His arrogance may\nhave been justified by\ntheir past three albums,\nbut the opener on this\none lacks the grandiosity\nto do so, perhaps giving\na jet-engine-roar-tinged\nglimpse at why many\ndoubt this album.\nThe mix of songs is\nalmost kaleidoscopic.\nMany are either stories recounting Rishikesh drama\n(\u2018Dear Prudence\u2019, \u2018Sexy\nSadie\u2019) or echoes of their\nfolky guitar-picking in the\nIndian north, like \u2018Wild\nHoney Pie\u2019, \u2018Mother\nNature\u2019s Son\u2019, \u2018Julia\u2019 and\n\u2018Blackbird\u2019. The last two\nare Lennon\u2019s and McCartney\u2019s respective odes to\nthe opposite sex; \u2018Julia\u2019\nbeing Lennon\u2019s way of\ntelling his mother that he\nhas finally replaced her\nwith Yoko, while \u2018Blackbird\u2019 was McCartney\u2019s\nway of showing empathy\nfor the civil rights\nmovement and helped him\nwin his future wife\u2019s heart\nthe first time she came to\nhis house. \u2018Blackbird\u2019 is\nan especially impressive\npiece as it was recorded\nand mixed in six hours.\nThe poignant simplicity\nof it only underlines\nMcCartney\u2019s genius and\nsingle-mindedness.\nWhile many claim that\nthe mixed bag of songs to\nhave found themselves on\nthe album are the reason\nwhy it cannot be counted\namongst their best, I am\ninclined to disagree. The\nuniqueness of the songs\nmeans that one can pick\nout any one of them for a\nsingle listen and not feel\nlike they\u2019re missing out.\nDespite their ability to be\nstand-alone listens, the\nwhole that they form is\nstill somewhat coherent, if\nnot entirely free-flowing,\nand offers an important\ninsight into a confusing\ntime for the band. Even\nthe songs that many love\nto hate, be it the hard-edged attempts by the\nfoursome to keep up with\nthe heavier, screeching\nsounds springing up from\nthe UK underground in\nthe late 60s, like \u2018Helter\nSkelter\u2019 (which helped set\noff Manson\u2019s killing spree\nin sunny California) and\n\u2018While My Guitar Gently\nWeeps\u2019 (featuring hard\nrock\u2019s morally contentious\ndaddy, Eric Clapton), or\nthe sugary nonsense of\n\u2018Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da\u2019 (a\nsong loved both by me\nand Murakami, isn\u2019t that\nan esteemed fanbase),\n\u2018Rocky Raccoon\u2019 (who\ndoesn\u2019t enjoy a wild west\nlove story) and \u2018Honey\nPie\u2019 (a warm-soup-like\nfeel-good song in the\nvein of \u2018When I\u2019m Sixty\nFour\u2019), are some of my\nfavourite Beatles songs to\nlisten to.\nAn unfair criticism\nlevelled at the album is\nthat all the songs are too\nsimple and complete\nnonsense. \u2018Happiness Is\nA Warm Gun\u2019 stands out\nas an incredibly complex\nand powerful song. The\nlyrics on \u2018Glass Onion\u2019\nare at once revealing and\ncompletely opaque (a\nLennon trademark), while\n\u2018Revolution 9\u2019 was something very revolutionary\nin music indeed \u2013 Ono\u2019s\ninfluence was responsible for this piece which\nbrought the concept of\n\u201crandom\u201d, Dada-like\ncollage art into music.\nOh, and it also features\nRingo\u2019s first composition\nfor the band, \u2018Don\u2019t Pass\nMe By\u2019.\nThe album that developed from a single jam\nsession which was half an\nhour long and powerful\nenough to spawn two\nsongs (Revolutions 1 and\n9), proves that the Beatles\nwere still able to produce\nmagic even when at odds\nwith each other, drugged\nout (the drug hiatus only\nlasted while in Rishikesh;\nLennon actually ended\nup on heroin), and out of\nfavour with the hysterical\npolitical youth. If even\ntheir gibberish ad-libs\ncan have this kind of\npop-culture influence, it\nonly shows why they are\nthe greatest of all time.\nWhite on White - Kazimir Malevich (Oil on canvas, 1918) // Apple\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Writer\n\u201cAn album\nmore varied\nthan anything\nthey\u2019d made\nbefore... to\nshow that the\nvirtue of music\ncan transcend\nearthly chaos\u201d\nContinuing in the\ntradition of all their\nefforts from Help!, the\nmonstrous 95-minute\ndouble album kicks off\non an unexpectedly fast\nthumper of a song. The\ntongue-in-cheek \u2018Back\nin the U.S.S.R.\u2019, which\nhad the working title \u2018I\u2019m\nbacking the U.S.S.R.\u2019,\nincited enough outrage as\n\u201cAn important\ninsight into a\nconfusing time\nfor the band\u201d\n\n"

So\nwhether that's around our\nglobal research position\nor the student experience.\nDoing this is quite an\nexciting opportunity\nIs there a typical day\nfor the Provost or is\nevery day different?\nI\u2019ve only been here\na month so no typical\nday yet! I haven\u2019t got\nto that point yet but, at\nthe moment, what I\u2019m\nspending my time doing\nis going around getting\nto know people, getting\nto know the Heads of\nFaculty and Heads of\nDepartments, visiting all\nthe departments over the\ncourse of the next few\nmonths, academics, junior\nresearchers, students, staff\nand getting a feel for the\nkey issues and aspirations.\nLearning a bit about that\nwill help inform how we\ndevelop the academic\nstrategy in the future.\nHow would you\ndescribe your first\nmonth?\nVery exciting. It\u2019s\nalways great to be in a\nnew place and learn about\nwhat\u2019s going on. But certainly there\u2019s a lot of stuff\ncoming at me so trying to\nget some of that to stick\nand start figuring out how\nthings fit with one another\nhas been the challenge I\nthink.\nYou were a student\nhere.Didyouhaveany\nimpressions about\nwhat the job would\nbe like and have they\nchanged? Have you\nbeen surprised by\nanything since you\nstarted working here?\nIhadhadquiteanumber\nof research collaborations\nwith colleagues, mainly\nin Physics, and also on\nother projects with senior\nleaders here so I had a\nsense of the place and\nthe sort of dynamism and\nagility that it has, which I\nthink was quite attractive.\nLearning about how that\u2019s\nworking and how one\nmight help improve that\nsort of thing has been the\nnew sort of things that I\u2019m\nbeginning to see. In terms\nof surprises, only that it\nalways looks more exciting than you think it\u2019s\ngoing to be but nothing\nthat has made me think\nthat I have at all made the\nwrong decision.\nWhat inspired you to\nstudy Physics?\nCertainly I found the\nidea of learning about\nthe way the world is at\nits fundamental structure\njust fascinating so I got\nreally fired up about it. I\nhad some good teachers\nin school that, when I was\nthinking about what to do\nwith that, pointed me to\nImperial and I\u2019m really\nglad they did because the\nidea of a university where\nyou could study with\nworld leading researchers,\nliving in London, was\nabsolutely the right thing\nfor me to do. The course\nhere, the people I worked\nwith, the people I met,\ncontinued to drive that.\nI felt I had a really great\nstart here and I\u2019m really\ngrateful for that.\nHere at Imperial,\nPhysics has\nunfortunately got\nquite a low student\nsatisfaction. Do\nyou have any plans\nto tackle the low\nstudent satisfaction,\nparticularly in Physics,\nbut across other\nsubjects?\nIt\u2019s really disappointing\nthat we\u2019re in that circumstance and we absolutely\nhavetofixit.Ithinkthere\u2019s\nno reason why every\nstudent here shouldn\u2019t\nreally feel that they are\ngetting not only a good\neducation but are part of\na thriving environment\nand community. I think\nthat\u2019s the way we need to\nroll here. I met with the\nHead of Physics just this\nmorning to learn about the\nplans that she is putting\nin place to really change\nthe dial and engage with\nstudents to understand\nwhat it is that\u2019s missing,\nhow they might fix it and\nI\u2019m impressed that has\nhappened rapidly and\nwith intention to change\nthings. Simone, the\nVice-Provost (Education)\nis also working with that\ngroup to understand how\nwe share best practice\nacross the College. Places\nthat have done extremely\nwell, like some of the\nEngineering departments,\nwhat are the things that\nthey\u2019ve been doing and\nhow do we determine\nwhether those will work in\nother places? That\u2019s now\ngetting underway and it\u2019s\nabsolutely the case that\nwe need to get this right.\nYou say some of the\nplans are already\ngetting underway,\nwhich specific plans\nare already in place?\nLooking at ways to\nchange the workload\nso you still get to learn\nthe things you need to\nbut in a way that gives\na bit more time for\nthinking. Student-staff\ninteraction- making sure\nIan Walmsley, Imperial's new Provost // Imperial College London\n\u201cI think there's\nno reason why\nevery student\nhere shouldn't\nreally feel\nthat they are\ngetting not\nonly a good\neducation\nbut are part\nof a thriving\nenvironment\nand\ncommunity.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at\nour diversity\nprofile in\nacademics, not\nonly in terms\nof race but also\nin terms of\ngender, there's\nclearly much\nwork to be\ndone\u201d\nthat the students and\nacademics are part of the\nsame community and that\npeople know one another.\nFiguring out how to find\nstudy space for students\nand things of that kind.\nAll of these I think are\nabout building the stu-dent-academic interaction\nand making sure that\nwhat is being asked of\nthe students is reasonable,\nwithout shirking on the\nexpectation that they\u2019re\ngoing to have to work\nhard to do well.\nlearning environment and\nan education where the\nbest students and best academics are learning side\nby side. That seems to me\nwhere we should be. We\nalready have a really fantastic set of academics and\nsome really great students\nso I think the core of that\nis there and our challenge\nis now how do we invest\nin that to really ensure that\nwe are globally visible\nand globally competitive.\nIn terms of investing\nin that, what do you\nsee as your input in\nshaping how Imperial\nbecomes more spoken\nabout on a global\nscale\nTaking our academic\nstrategy and vision and\nmaking that into a very\nclear narrative that we\ncan use externally to\nshow how Imperial is\npushing the boundaries\nof knowledge and using\nthat knowledge for the\nbenefit of the world and\nproviding people with\nopportunities to learn\nwithin that is a core\nthing. Drawing together\nthat strategy and making\nit into a strong external\nvision. Also, figuring out\nhow we implement that.\nWe\u2019re not going to be able\nto do everything at once so\nhow do we plan that out,\nprioritise and move along\nthat trajectory? You\u2019ll\nbe aware of the great opportunities around White\nCity, around the Masterplan for this campus and\nall of the plans that the\nfaculties have.\nLast year there were\nthe UCU strikes. What\nare your thoughts on\nthe fallout from the\nstrikes and what is\nthe College doing to\nensurethatsomething\nlike the strikes doesn\u2019t\nhappen again?\nJust as we talked about\nthe student experience and\nthe student community\nneeds to be a valued part\nof the institution, that\u2019s\ncertainly true for the staff\nas well and the pensions\nare clearly a part of that.\nOf course I wasn\u2019t here\nwhen the discussion was\ngoing on earlier but what\nwe\u2019re now going to take\nforward is we\u2019ve got... a\nconsultation from USS\nand UUK coming up.\nWe\u2019re going to talk with\nacademics about their response to the recommendations or the suggestions\nthat have been made and\nhow we respond to that\nconsultation. I think it\u2019s a\nwhole College conversation so that we can come\nup with a plan that is good\nfor individuals and good\nfor the College as a whole.\nHow is the university\npreparing for Brexit,\nwhat do you think\nwill be the effect of\na no-deal Brexit on\nImperial?\nClearly Brexit is a\nmajor change coming\nup in the next year and\nit would be silly to think\nit won\u2019t have an impact\non the College. I think a\nkey issue, probably the\nleading issue, is how does\nit affect people. We\u2019ve\ngot a lot of European\nstaff and students and we\nwant to make sure that\nthey consider themselves\nabsolutely part of the\ncommunity and valued.\nWe will continue to work\nto make sure that happens.\nWe\u2019re going to remain a\nglobally facing institu-tion. That\u2019s not going to\nchange in intent. So all\nwe\u2019re doing is navigating\nour way through when\nthe new legislation comes\ndown the line. In terms of\nother impacts, we do get\na considerable amount of\nresearch income from the\nEU and it may be that that\nchanges in some way. It\u2019s\nstill up in the air entirely\njust what our relationship\nwith the European Union\nwill be. It\u2019s a little bit\ncrazy but the signs from\ngovernment have always\nbeen very positive that\nresearch engagement is\nimportant for the UK.\nWith a forward plan that\u2019s\nbased on an industrial\nstrategy, you just can\u2019t\nafford not to have world\nleading ideas generation\nand exploitation in this\ncountry. So I hope that we\ncome to a position where\nwe can continue to participate in the framework\nprograms in some way.\nDoyouhaveanyplans\nfor Arts at imperial?\nThis morning I was\njust meeting with Ollie\nat the Blyth centre and\nlearning about what\nfantastic contribution that\nmakes to College life. We\ntalked a little bit about\nthat aspect of what the\nBlyth Centre might be\nlooking for in the future\nand may be looking to do.\nI cannot say I have plans\nyet but that part of the\nCollege, coupled with the\nlocation that we\u2019re in, this\nfantastic agglomeration\nof museums and colleges,\nhas got to provide some\nreally cool opportunities.\nThe Dyson School of\nDesign Engineering and\nthat joint masters course\nbetween Imperial and the\nRoyal College of Art is\njust a wonderful example\nof the kind of things we\ncan do. There\u2019s joint\nprograms with the Royal\nCollege of Music, Physics\nand Maths I think. That\u2019s\ngreat as well. The raw\nmaterial we have is really\nfantastic and I\u2019m sure\nthere\u2019s something that can\nhappen.\nWill Freedom of\nSpeech on campus be\nprotected?\nYes absolutely. It\u2019s\ncrucial that people are\nable to speak their minds\nand we should do that in\nan environment of dignity\nand respect for that dis-course.\nOctober is Black\nHistory Month. I just\nwrote about the Race\nEquality Charter and\nthe Equality Diversity\nand Inclusion strategy\n(EDI). For the last\nten years there have\nbeen less than 5 black\nlecturers. In terms\nof speaking more\nbroadly about EDI\nand also tackling this\ndirect issue where\nthere\u2019s not that much\ndiversity in the senior\nlecturerposition,what\nare yours and the\nCollege\u2019s plans?\nI think you\u2019re absolutely right. If you look\nat our diversity profile in\nacademics, not only in\nterms of race but also in\nterms of gender, there\u2019s\nclearly much work to be\ndone. The strategy and\nits implementation I think\nare one way we get started\non that but we do need to\nbe very active in looking\nat ways to change that\nbalance. Again, I don\u2019t\nhave a detailed plan for\nyou at this stage but we\u2019ll\ncertainly do that in the\ncontext of world leading\nexcellence in research\nand education- that will\nbe the benchmark and\nwe\u2019ll work within that\nframework and the EDI\nstrategy to make sure that\nwe increase representation\nfrom those groups\nHow do you spend\nyour free time? Do you\nhave any?\nI like to cycle. I try to go\nout on weekends and ride\naround the countryside.\nMy wife is the Director of\nChapel music at Wadham\nin Oxford so I sing in her\nchoir when I can.\nDo you enjoy being an\nacademic?\nYeah I do. I\u2019ve really\nhad a career that I\u2019ve\nreally enjoyed at every\nstage and the idea that you\ncan think about the world\nand think about the way\nin which your ideas can\nimpact it and work with\ngreat young students and\nWhat would you say\nis the single biggest\nproblem that Imperial\nhas and your biggest\nchallenge in taking\nup the role? How do\nyou see the future of\nImperial and how you\ncan help to shape that\nfuture?\nI think the opportunity\nthat Imperial has is as\na world leading higher\neducation institution that\nreally is globally compet-itive. That\u2019s mentioned up\nthere in the same breath as\nMIT and the places that\nare driving the forefront of\nresearch, coupled together\nwith a cutting edge, really\nvibrant teaching and\nyoung people has just\nbeen fantastic. Wouldn\u2019t\nchange it.\nWhat advice would\nyou give to a student\nor someone just\nstarting out in their\ncareer, in academia or\na wider career?\nKeep at it. Work hard,\nhave confidence in yourself and just push along.\nWhich was your fav\nLove Island couple?\nI have to say I did not\ncatch Love Island so I\ncan\u2019t really address that\nquestion. I have only very\nrecently really briefly\nunderstood the concept of\nLove Island.\n\n"

Last week, new\nstudent reps were elected\nin every department, and\nthough turnout figures are\ncertainly worth celebrat-ing, today I want to talk\nabout what comes next.\nEvery day decisions\nare made in our name\nthat we never really hear\nabout: at College and departmental meetings, by\nUnion Council (made up\nof elected student reps),\nand by the Union\u2019s Board\nof Trustees (a handful of\nstudents and externally\nappointed\u2018laypeople\u2019,and\nour sabbatical officers).\nEven when items are\ntechnically public, there\u2019s\na limit to the amount of\ndigging its reasonable to\nexpect full time students\nto be doing in their off-hours, and mass emails\nare far from perfect (does\nanyone read them?).\nLast year I was elected\nto Trustee Board on a\nplatform of transparency,\nand with that in mind I will\nbe writing articles periodically to let any interested\nstudents know what\u2019s\ngoing on in the Union\nand more generally at the\nuniversity. I won\u2019t pretend\nto be impartial, but I will\ntry to explain things with\nwhich I disagree in good\nfaith. I\u2019d encourage you to\nat least skim these pieces;\nthere will almost certainly\nbe at least one or two\nthings in here that matter\nto you, and it\u2019s difficult to\ndo anything about them\nwithout being informed.\nWhere the union\u2019s power lies // Imperial College Assets\n\u201cProviding\nfairly priced\nservices for\nstudents may\ninvolve a\ndifferent way\nof allocating\nthe budget\u201d\nCourse content in\nevery department is\nbeing reviewed\nI\u2019ve mentioned this\nbefore, but its probably\nthe single most important thing happening on\ncampus this year. Departments have until March to\nfinalise their proposals on\nchanges to their curricula,\nand though your academic\nreps should already be\naware of and involved in\nthis process, it wouldn\u2019t\nhurt to nudge them if you\nhave any concerns. Search\nfor \u201cImperial College\nRepresentatives\u201d if you\ndon\u2019t know who they are.\nRoom bookings\nThis has been the cause\nof a lot of frustration for\nmany societies so far this\nyear. Consternation at the\nslow pace of change here\nis understandable, given\nthat this isn\u2019t the first time\nthere have been issues\naround room bookings.\nI\u2019ve been told that part of\nthe problem this year has\nbeen that clubs\u2019 annual\nbookings took so long to\nvalidate that start of term\nad hoc bookings were\ndisrupted. Conversations\nare currently taking place\naround automating the\nformer to leave more time\nfor the latter. Hopefully,\nthis approach and the\nDeputy President (Clubs\nand Societies)\u2019s focus on\n\u201cimproving processes\u201d\nwill help ameliorate this\nissue, and I intend to keep\nraising it until there is a\nreal solution.\nSquash Courts/Ethos\nA paper was brought to\nthe last Council meeting\ndiscussing pricing at\nthe Ethos squash courts\nrelative to other venues.\nNaturally, the debate\ntouched on the wider issue\nof the Ethos price hike\nwhere (lest we forget) the\nuniversity broke its word\nto all returning students\nand increased the charge\nfrom a one off \u00a340 to\n\u00a330/year. This would be a\ngreat rate for consumers,\nbut we aren\u2019t consumers,\nwe\u2019re students. Imperial\nas a whole, runs a significant surplus (\u00a3119m\nin 2016-17), orders of\nmagnitude greater than\nits projected gains on\nthis price hike. It is also\nworth noting that direct\nstudent contributions still\nconstitute a relatively\nsmall proportion of the\nEthos budget, begging the\nquestion \u2013 why increase\nthese rates at all?\nConsidering this, one\nof the most important\npoints raised at Council\nchallenged the idea that\nin order to fund (for\nexample) cheaper squash\ncourts, Sport Imperial\nwould have to take money\nfrom one of their other\nofferings. These budgets\naren\u2019t zero sum games,\neach service doesn\u2019t exist\nin a vacuum. Providing\nfairly priced, comprehensive services for students\nmay involve reaching\nbeyond preordained de-marcations in the budget\nand questioning the\nunderlying assumptions\nCollege uses to decide\nwhere its money goes.\nPay rises for student\nbar staff\nLast year, the bar staff\norganised a petition for\npay to be increased to\nthe London Living Wage,\nin line with other major\nLondon universities\n(notably UCL, KCL,\nLSE). This petition\ngarnered over 900 signa-tures, though at the time\nthe Union and the then\nDeputy President (Finance\nand Services) rejected the\nmove to a Living Wage.\nTheir rejoinder was that\nmoney could be better\nspent elsewhere and price\nrises should be avoided,\nthough it should be noted\nprices did end up rising\nanyway.\nThis year, agitation\naround pay increases has\nrestarted, citing the taxing\nnature of the work - particularly in conjunction\nwith full time study, the\npay at other student bars,\nand potential alternative\nsources of funding (i.e.\nwithout raising prices\nin the bar). Thus far, the\noutcomes of this remain\nto be seen.\nPostgraduate (PG)\nRepresentation\nPhysics PG Rep and\nNatural Sciences PG Rep\nto Council Lloyd James\nhas been working on the\nissue of PG engagement\nand representation at\nImperial. His proposal\nconsists of steps that\nwould give PG students\nthe opportunity to participate more actively\nCOMMENT\nFRIDAY, 26TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\n11\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhere the real power lies // Imperial College Assets\n\u201cSocieties\nshould be\nable to host\nevents without\ninterfence if\nthey\u2019re not\nviolating any\nrules\u201d\nin the relevant Constituent Unions (CGCU,\nICSMSU, RCSU, RSMU)\nwhich currently solely\ncater to undergraduate\nstudents. This would not\naffect their membership of\nthe GSU. A discussion on\nthis matter will take place\nat the next Union Council\nmeeting November 13th,\n6.30 in RSM G.01. These\nmeetings are public, so\nfeel free to attend.\nGraduation Speech.\nUnion President Rob\nTomkies was prevented\nfrom giving his own\nspeech at the graduation\nceremony this year and\nwas instead compelled to\ndeliver the same prepared\nremarks as in every prior\nyear since 1949. While\nthere\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with tradition,\nthe existing address\u2019\nappeals to monarchism,\nimperialism and nationalism (in both Latin and\nEnglish) miss the mark for\na cosmopolitan university\nin the 21st century. Rob\nis currently working with\nCollege to ensure future\nspeeches of this kind\nbetter reflect our values.\nPenalties for Sexual\nMisconduct\nDaniel Wigh, Chair of\nthe \u2018Knowledge Sector\u2019\n(which handles admin for\nthesetofclubsfocussedon\ncareers, debate and educa-tion, such as FinanceSoc\nand Debate) successfully\npassed a paper at Council\ntoughening punishment\nfor those found guilty of\nnon-minor instances of\nsexual misconduct. Going\nforward, in addition to\nother sanctions, these\nindividuals would be\nprevented from holding\nany elected office in the\nUnion (i.e. as a rep or on\nany society committee).\nGiven issues in this area\nin the past, this is a highly\ncommendable step. As\nwas said in the meeting,\nany student should be\nable to take for granted\nthat their fellow students\nin positions of power\nhaven\u2019t acted abusively.\nStocking of Tabloids\nin the Union Shop\nAnsh Bhatnagar,\nUndergraduate Rep to\nCouncil from Natural\nSciences, proposed\na paper mandating\nthe Union to cease its\nstocking and selling of the\nDaily Express, Daily Mail\nand the Sun, due to their\nexplicitly racist content.\nThis led to an impassioned\ndebate on free speech vs.\nwhat we\u2019re comfortable\npromoting, with a compromise that these papers\nwill remain in stock but\nany proceeds from their\nsale will be directed to an-ti-racist campaign groups,\nand the Union will take\na more active stance in\nraising complaints against\ninflammatory articles.\nDivest Imperial.\nTwice in as many\nweeks, students from\nDivest Imperial, the\ncampaign pushing\nCollege to withdraw\nits investments from\nFossil Fuels, have been\ndisplaced by Campus\nSecurity for handing\nout fliers and holding\nup placards near where\nevents with government\nand fossil fuel companies\nare being held on campus.\nGiven that their protests in\nthese cases were not dis-ruptive, and that we have\na mandate to protect free\nspeech, I will be working\nto lessen this kind of\nundue interference, and\nhope and expect for Union\nbacking to this end.\nLeft Forum Event\nA \u201cLockpicking\nWorkshop\u201d event organised by the Imperial Left\nForum was this week\nindefinitely postponed by\nthe Union. The organisers\nwere told this was because\nthe content of the event did\nnot match up well to the\naims and objectives of the\nsociety, while at a Trustee\nBoard meeting the sabbatical officers also cited the\nlarge number of responses\non the Facebook event\n(1.6K going or interested)\nas a concern, as well as the\nlarge numbers of non-stu-dents responding to the\nevent and the lack of an\nevent budget (though I\u2019m\nnot sure one was necessary in this case). My own\nview is that, once any\npractical considerations\naround e.g. numbers are\nresolved, the event should\ngo ahead. Our societies\nshould be able to host\ntheir own events without\ninterference if they aren\u2019t\nviolating any rules around\n(for example) inclusivity\nor financial responsibility.\nNSS/PTES Response\nResponses to the\nNational Student Survey\nand Postgraduate-Taught\nExperience Survey were\nproduced (in record time)\nby this year\u2019s Deputy\nPresident (Education)\nAlex Luy. The responses\ninclude recommendations\non training for weaker\nmembers of staff and reviewing marking criteria.\nThe full documents are\navailable on the Union\nwebsite.\nSummer Ball\nGiven concerns\naround space and student\nnumbers, it is possible\nthere will be a search for\nan alternative (off-cam-pus) venue for the 2020\nSummer Ball.\nThis is far from a comprehensive list, and some\nkey issues such as the\nfight for a common room\nfor Life Scientists and the\nCounselling Service will\nappear in future articles.\nNonetheless, I hope this\nhas been a useful window\ninto goings-on in the\nUnion. If there\u2019s anything\nyou want further clarification on, or anything you\nwould like me to raise,\nplease get in touch at:\na b h i j a y. s o o d 1 5 @\nimperial.ac.uk\n\n"
