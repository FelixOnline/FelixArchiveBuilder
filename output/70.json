    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE FELIX is now five years old, and sino e everyone will agree this is quite a mature age\nfor a oat it is high time he had a Profile all his own. There was a time when a real FELIX\nexisted, a life sized papier mao he one; but this was too fragile ama soot, and it vanished long\nago, either in. a College rag or at one of the\nmore riotous FELIX Birthday DanoeB, we are not\nsure wh i oh. These days the only trophy in the\nFELIX cupboard is a sign-board advertising books\nsold, which was (borrowed) from a very reputable local bookshop.\nFELIX manifests himself to the Union by\nfortnightly excursions into print, of wh i oh this present issue i a the seventieth. To pro duo e these seventy issues over the years there have\nbeen nine Editors and countless hard-working\nmembers of the Board. Past experience has\nshown that the life of an Editor i a a half year, and that FELIX always outlives its Editorial Boards quite easily. All the present Board\ncame to I.C. when. FELIX waa an. old established friend of the Union. Nowadays he is quite a well-behaved animal, no more oat fights and spitting, although never afraid to reach out a paw\nand give remonstrating scratch to those who deserve it. FELIX has always been, rather like Kipling' s oat, he de ff in at ely likes to walk by\nhimself. This is a reputation to be proud of\nsince it is based on the fao t that I.e.'s newspaper has always supported itself financially, no mean achievement, although it means there is not mu oho avi are and- ore amin the FELIX diet.

DEBATE In hiring the main theatre of the Institut Francais\nfor alun oh time function, the Literary and Debating\nSociety ran a considerable risk of debacle. How-ever, the notoriously fickle common hard turned up\nIn sufficient numbers to justify the experiment and\na successful debate followed.\nMr. James Walters, pro poe ing that \" This House\nHefuses to Toe the Party Line \", pointed out some\nbad results of party management in recent years,and\noccasionally said something relevant to the motion.\nUr.Walters is a Liberal, and like many others has\nstood for Parliament; so It vac ironical to hear\nhim say \" the death agony of the Labour Party has\nbegun.\"\nUr.Austen Albu, U.P.( Labour), an ex-Guildsmam\nturned I.C. Governor, opposed. His line was Practical Government. He described the ln stab il ty of\nthe French system with too many parties, and the\n\u2022 gifting flux of American politics dominated by\nmass clam our and the T.V. screen. Neither method\nsuited us: \" France has gone to the dogs, and U.S.A. is powerful enough to dither safely. Britain needs\na two-party system, in wh i oha united opposition\nattacks the policy of a united government in order\nto probe and expose its weaknesses. While small\ndeviations from the \" party line\" are desirable, there should in general be a united front. Ur. UcCormick of Q.U. C., who spoke very well reo ent ly about the actress and the bishop, seconded\nthe proposition by banging a big Liberal drum with\na red herring. He succeeded in tapping a resonant\nfrequency in Ur. Ibbetson, who mercifully relieved the monotony by Jumping out of his seat in expos tula tory protest towards the end of the speech,\nwhich seemed Very long. Ur. Allen of I.C.( cheers)\nspoke fourth. He appeared nervous, but his delivery was exhilarating, and although the least polished, he was the most attractive speaker. He was very brief his argue ment s having been used by the efficient Mr.Albu, and his principal contribution was to suggest that, as an M.P. is elected entirely because\nof his label, then he must act by it. It is fair to\nsay that such a thin plank held Mr. Allen up only\nbecause he tripped along It so lightly. An intriguing remark from the floor came from Mr.\nIbbetson, who propounded the Logical Dilema that, since the proposer s were acting together on the mot--ion they were in fao t toeing the party line. This\nline was not clear to the Proposers.\nMr. Walters then gained some prestige by con rect ing Mr. Berenbaum, who quoted Gilbert& Sul ii x an. Ur. Berenbaun,has the last laugh however, since Mr.\n\u2022 alters has since been proved incorrect. Ur Bingham suggested that government could only\nbe a compromise between Ethics and Experience, and\nthis idea, echoed by Ur. Albu In summing up, may be\nconsidered an accurate expression of the general\nsentiment. _ Forty six people lost their deposits,\nand seventy two found themselves, perhaps to their surprise, toeing the party line. THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS \"Thou shalt call Hi s name Jesus, for He\nshall save His. people from their sins.\" As\nthe year draws round to Christmas once more,\nmay we a3k how many of us have ever troubled\nourselves to search beyond the facade of\nChristmas, to find the meaning and purpose\nOf that first Christmas. The birth of a great prophet? a teacher? a philosopher? a leader? -- or the incarnate Son of God? This is a question which weu may ignore to our\nperil, for such a momentous question demands\nthat each of us should seek, as did those\nwise men of old, to find that child called Jesus, that we may be able to find the answer\nto that question.\nWe may not be able to look, as they did, upon the newborn infant, but we o an see far beyond that statin. 'Te see the life of one\nin whom the Jews could find no fault. We\nsee him dying, not because he hf.d no other\nchoice, but because it was to die that He was\nborn, to die for you. \u201e ,\nSuch a one demands an answer. Yes or\n\"No\". A life belonging to Him, or to yourself. He cannot accept \"perhaps\".\n\n"

Bar and,\nas such, feel moved to protest at some of the\nirresponsible behaviour we witnessed last Saturday\nduring the Peli x Dance.\nWe were, as is our wont, enjoying a few pints of good English ale when there burst upon ua a crowd of juvenile hop goers who, apart from clogging up the free flow of beer to ex tabl is he d customers, smashed a glass on the floor.

Strange tales were told of the pitfalls lurking within and of the terrible death by ploughing\nwhich awaited those who lost their way through,\nrelying on Cartesian coordinates when they should have been in homogenous polar s, or who got out of their depth in the wave equation. But this was\nas nothing to the horrors reported to await those\nwho at last reached the centre of the Labyrinth. A monster was reputed to live there, who subjected those who met him to a terrible Ordeal by Examinat ion, from which the strongest emerged trembling and babbling incoherently. Their colleagues shook\ntheir heads in distress over the poor, obsessed\ncreatures who were once human beings and called them \"Mathematicians.\" For years this went on,\nthe flower of the land being transformed into subhuman wrecks, until one day there arrived a man\noutstanding among his peers. His differentials were perfect, his functions were not only continuous but monotonic, and the sparkle which came\nand went in hie eyes was indescribable, save as\nthe sum of an infinite series of sines and\ncosines. Now the monster in the centre of the maze\nkept certain hand-maidens to minister to him, for his food consisted solely of punched cards, and it was his maiden's duty to arrange the holes in the\ncards in a pattern calculated to whet his appetite One of these maidens was greatly struck with the\nbeauty of the young man: she admired him as,\nearth stained and spade In hand, he grubbed among\nthe roots of quint io equations: she pitied him\nas, travel worn and weary, he stumbled on to a graph, clutching a unit pole he had brought from\ninfinity. He, in his turn, was not insensible to\nher beauty and at last they declared their love. She Bet herself to help her beloved to the best of\nher ability, so much so that his mentors were\namazed by his firm grasp of the bra function, and\nhis account of the \"Moments of an In pul sive Couple\" was eagerly sought after, especially after it WBS banned in Swindon.\nAt last the time arrived for the student to\nventure to the very centre of the Labyrinth. Before he left, his lover told him what to expect\nand gave him full Instructions on how to deal with It; yet even so he was appalled at the loathsome\ncreature he found there - an Automatic Digital Computer, terrible among its networks and banks of\nvalves. As it caught sight of his shrinking figure, the A.B.C. gnashed its relay single e and\ncried( by means of an Ingenious mechanism fully described in another paper):\n\"What have we here? Another puny mortal oom e to pit Its feeble brain against me; It won't take\nlong to turn you into a raving mathematician.\"\nAnd all its valve filaments glowed with pleasure.\" I'm going to give you a problem\" It said, \"and\nyou must get the answer before I do, and you will stay here until you win. Quick now; a man takes\na random walk on a Euclidean plane and between\neach step he takes a drink of whisky. What is his position after a thousand steps, taking his initial P08 ltl on as origin?\" Almost at once there\nwas a terrible clatter of relays and it gave the\nanswer.\n\"Come, come, you must try harder\" it said smugly. \"Take an easier one . . . \"\nDimly, in his confused brain, the student\nremembered his instructions.\" Isn't it my turn to put a question now?\" he\nsaid. The A.D.C. raised its flip flops in surprise. \"No one else has ever asked for a turn.\nStill,\" it chuckled, \" I don't see why not. Ask\naway, \"\n\"What,\" said the student nervously, \" is the\nexact value of \"JT?\"\n\"3\"1U15...\" began the computer and continued\nsteadily at the rate of two hundred and twenty-two\ndigits a minute. The student listened to it for half an hour and then stole away, e smile on his\nface. The computer would never trouble students\nagain.\nThe student and the maiden lived happily ever\nafter. The Labyrinth still exists, of course, but\nthe monster was finally bricked up; although it is said that if you place your ear to one particular wall you o an even now hear a dull metal li* vole* reciting an endless string of meaningless\nnumerals. The theory that this is merely the\nvoice of a well-known lecturer is, of course,\npurely malicious.\nJonathan Staggers.\n\n"

The premeditated entry was\n\"The Man of Destiny\" by Shaw, acted by Mia ha el Spenoe, Pat Wilton, Dick Saunders and John Hendy,\nand the spontaneous entry was the never-too-frequent \"Phoenix\", re sur reo ted by Pat Wilton, Sheila Taylor and John Aakew.\nThe latter pro du otl on, a hy bl rd between la et Easter's version and that ao ted at Cheltenham,\nhappened because Goldsmiths cancelled tn eir entry of t ne same play VAO days bei'ore the Festival, leaving a nasty gap to be filled. The organisers, lamenting in the Marlborough Arms, met up with someone influential in I.C.U.S. and hence t ne Phoenix rose again, on one rehearsal and a little faith. The happy result very nearly won the first prize, being only very narrowly beaten by\nBlrkbeok'eon arming production of Shaw's\" A Village wooing\"; the official entry was also well received, though more appreciated by the\naud leno e than the adjudicator.
