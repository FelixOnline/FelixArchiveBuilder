The elections have kept\na serious level of betting maintained;\nGuildsheet slags me down for picking\nthree-legged donkeys; and the FELIX\nEditor advises me which horse to\nback (which incidentally, came in at\na very nice 11-4).\nAnyway, next week will prove\neven more hectic with one of the\nhighlights of the racing calendar\u2014The\nCheltenham Festival. Regular\nfollowers of this column will have a fair idea of my recommended\nselections but here's a swift preview:\nThe Gold Cup, March 17\nCavvies Clown has now been cleared\nof all doping allegations by The\nJockey Club and is now free to run.\n1984 winner, Burrough Hill Lad was\nretired from racing last Saturday\nnight, so no winner for Penny Pitman\nthis year. This was much to the\nannoyance of one FELIX candidate\nin last week's election. He denies all\nknowledge of backing it despite\ntipping it three weeks previous. Only\na fortnight ago, Jenny Pitman was\nquoted as saying, 'It's not a question\nof whether or not he'll win, but by\nhow far'. Not far enough by the looks\nof it.\nYahoo is looking good after his\nconvincing win on Saturday at\nHaydock. Watching it on the box, I was very impressed with his\nperformance and he could represent\na nice each-way shot at 20-1. Yahoo\nShan's Racing\nColumn\nonly cost his owner 40,000gn s and\nmay well emulate Alverton (1979) and\nRoyal Frolic (1976) by going on to\nGold Cup success after winning at\nHaydock the weekend before.\nUndeterred by all this, however, I am going to stick with my old\nfavourite Playschool. Superstitious\nreaders may like to know that I was\nlooking for FELIX 750 which\ncontained an article on gambling. I eventually found it. The headline?\nPlayschool. Back it.\nNow, as promised in FELIX a fortnight ago, I can now reveal my\nmain tip for the Festival next week\nDaviil, Elseworth is re-running\nSkevena after he finished third in\nFolkestone in the middle of last\nmonth. Keep your eyes peeled for this\nnag's outing and back it heavily each\nway. I will!\nFinally, for all those interested in\ngoing to Cheltenham next week, here\nare the details:\nA luxury coach leaves Victoria\nterminus at 9am and leaves the\nracecourse half an hour after the last\nrace. The fare is \u00a310. All club badges\nfor the three days are sold out.\nHowever, Tattersalls tickets are still\navailable for the first two days and\nwill be on sale on Gold Cup day from\n(Lian^\nTfl don't see you at the Festival,\nhave a good one.

Mr Peck has not attended a single Rocksoc meeting\nthis term.\nWe would therefore like to object in the strongest\npossible terms to Mr Peck's use of our society to further\nhis political ambitions.\nLove, light and peace,\nThe Rocksoc Committee.\nPS. We shall shortly be reading omens from Mr Peck's entrails.\nSavage challenge\nDear Judith,\nImagine our surprise when we read in last week's FELIX that the Penthouse Club go sharking every Friday\nnight.\nWe of the Gauntlet Club also don our fins every\nweekend and hereby challenge The Penthouse Club to a 'Jaws Evening' on the Friday night of their choosing.\nPolice Chief Brody will be informed.\nA word of caution: One person in Southside last week\ngot severely savaged by a black fin and lost all feeling\nfrom the neck down. Luckily, he saw the funny side of it.\nCheers,\nThe Gauntlet Club.\nSinister CU\nDear FELIX,\nI am glad that questions are being asked about the\n'Christian Union' (FELIX 796). What annoys me most\nabout this movement is its name, presumably adopted in\norder to trick us into believing it represents all Christians.\nThe orthodox Christian view is that Christ founded a movement and left his spirit working in that movement.\nThat movement which became known as the Catholic\n(meaning 'universal') Church, later collected together\nvarious writings which were circulating to form the Bible.\nSo the Bible is the product of Christianity, not vice versa\nas the CU claim.\nTaken outside the context of the Catholic church (which\nI take to include not only the Roman Catholic church, but\nalso the Orthodox churches, and others which maintain\nthe history, traditions and teachings handed down to us\nfrom the first Christians and developed by centuries of\nprayer and contemplation) the Bible is an obscure jumble.\nIf one accepts the Bible as the sole source of authority\n(as every member of the CU must) one is no more a Christian than one would be a true follower of any other\nreligion if one picked up its sacred books and developed\none's own religion based on them. Indeed, what\njustification do the CU have for rejecting the Gnostic\ngospels and other works that were not included in the\nBible, if they reject the Church that compiled it?\nIn fact the CU take a peculiarly selective view of the\nBible. That view started when people like Martin Luther\ncriticised the Church for appearing to sell salvation for\ncash, using flashy imagery, and over-focussing services\non the individuals leading them. It is hard to believe th af people like Swaggart, Baker, Robertson, and the other\nAmerican TV evangelists, of which the CU are the British\nwing, trace their origins to Luther's protests (hence\n'Protestant').\nThe most important Protestant belief is 'justification of\nfaith alone'. This means rejecting the whole of Christ's radical social teaching on helping the poor and so on, as\nuseless (strangely they do not seem to hold the same view\non sexual matters). That is why their declaration is so\nimportant to the CU. If you do not accept it, no matter\nhow good your life, you are doomed. To them, Mother\nTheresa of Calcutta will go to Hell. It is no wonder that\nright-wing politicians the world over have taken up this\nreligion with enthusiasm.\nHaving seen the CU in action at three different\nuniversities, I am convinced they are a sinister force which\nought no longer to be tolerated by other Christians whose\nname they abuse.\nYours sincerely,\nMatthew Huntbach (Dept of Computing).\nMoney takers?\nDear Judith,\n| My attention was recently drawn to the front page of\nlast week's FELIX and the story entitled 'Moonie-rakers'.\nOn reading the story, which purported to be informing\nIC students about CARP, I could not but feel a tinge of\ndeja vu.\nOn checking my archives, I discovered why. Almost\nall the 'factual' material about CARP was lifted straight\nout of a two-year old copy of FELIX; this despite most\nof the material in that copy having been challenged as\ninaccurate or misleading, in a letter from the then UKCARP Director, printed two weeks later.\nTherefore, for the sake of those who were not privileged\nto be readers of FELIX at that time, I'd like to raise a number of points again.\n1. CARP and the Unification Church.\nCARP is a movement for students who are concerned\nabout resolving the problems of society and the world.\nFor this reason, meetings and seminars are organised on\ndiverse issues. Attendance and/or membership is not\nrestricted to members of the Unification Church.\nFurthermore, Reverend Moon is clearly identified as the\nfounder of CARP in two introductory leaflets (copies\nenclosed with this letter) distributed on campus by CARP\nmembers.\n2. The 'Brainwashing' Myth\nThe charge that the Moonies practice brainwashing\ntechniques has been fully discredited by recent sociological\nand psychological studies (see especially 'The Making of\na Moonie' by Dr E Barker of LSE). An attempt to uphold\na similar charge in court (made by HM Attorney General)\nwas recently dropped on account of what amounted to an\nabsence of any credible evidence.\n3. 'CARP is a sinister organisation'\nThere is nothing secretive about CARP. Members are\nalways happy to try and explain aspects of Unification,\nthe philosophy of CARP, to the best of their ability. CARP\nno more 'feeds on the loneliness and unhappiness of\npeople' than the NHS does on their ill health.\nYours sincerely\nDr C Turfus, Director CARP-UK.\nFELIX Friday March 11th198815 "

    "content": "MUSIC\nlew s Luxuria\nUnanswerable Lust\nHoward Devoto, tx-Buzzcocks and\nMagazine frontman is in partnership\nwith guitarist Noko in his latest\nventure Luxuria.\nI'm glad to see he still retains his\nrare grasp of the English language.\nThese songs are narrated rather than\nsung in a whining drawl. Side A contributes nothing being too\ngrandiose and pompous.\nSide B contains all that is worth\nlistening to. 'Celebrity' is the most\noutstanding with its flashing guitar,\nMile however is a bit over the top\nlyrically\u2014quoting Marcel Proust!\nLuxuria are playing the Town and\nCountry Club on March 13, which is\ndefinitely worth going to.\n(Beggars Banquet)\nThe title 'Cuba' may lend your\nrecord collection a bit of credibility\nthough.\n(Ediesta)\nThe Lilac Time\nSilos\nCuba\nThe Silos it would appear from the\nsleeve, (which also depicts a nude\nman playing guitar on the reverse)\nhail from the USA. I'm afraid to say\nthat the sleeve is the most exciting\npart of this album. Drawling\nAmerican vocals combine with simple\nguitar riffs and a monotonous drum\nbeat to produce an almost w impish sound. Bands like this have British\nequivalents in Indie acts of The\nChesterfields ilk.\nWell this is typical Indie pop, light\nand frothy, but unusually the vocals\nare very strong making this rather\ngood. Their style reminds me of\nDeacon Blue charting at present with\n'Dignity', I'm sure the singer is\nSteven Duffy, responsible for the hit\n'Kiss Me' a few years ago.\nThe best track is 'Return to\nYesterday' which is infuriatingly\ncatchy and was I think available on\na single. 'Rockland' is a bit of social\npolitical criticism, but delivered up in\nthis style will anyone notice? I doubt\nit.\n(Swordfish)\nPink Peg Slax\n12 Songs Never Recorded by\nFrank Sinatra\nSimilar to a number of bands, The\nChevalier Brothers and The Jivin'\nInstructors spring to mind, this is pure\nRock 'n' Roll. If your taste is for\nhonky-tonk piano, R'n' Rgu itS r and\na thumping double-bass this will go\ndown very well.\nA band worth going to see because\nof the atmosphere at a gig which can't be captured on vinyl.\n(Ediesta)\nWoodenfoot Cops on the\nHighway-The Woodentops\nIf you have ever seen the Woodentops\nlive you'll know the energy that Rolo\nand his chums can generate. Energy\nthat was not really captured on their\nfirst slab of vinyl 'Giant'. This time\nhowever the boys have come good.\n'Woodenfoot Cops ' is proof\nthat dance music can be tuneful and\ndoesn't have to be cribbed (ie\nsampled) from James Brown. But\nthat's not to say that its dated at all,\nRolo is definitely moving with the\ntimes\u2014this man's no stick-in-the-mud.\nThe surprise track of the album is\n'Wheels Turning' which has a wailing\nheavy-metal guitar over that\nWoodentops' acoustic strum. The\nhighlight for me though is the single\n'You Make Me Feel'. A juicy pedal\nsteel guitar and beautiful lyrics\ncombine to produce a truly heavenly\nsong.\nOh yes, last week's review of\nCleveland contained a comparison to\nMcCarney (who's he?). Thankfully\nthey sound nothing at all like the\naforementioned; it should have read\nMcCarthy, the jangle-pop ster s from\nSouth London. But then you all knew\nthat, didn't you?\nBrad Blundell\nThe Fall\nHMV Oxford Circus\nThis appearance was rather unusual\nfor The Fall who aren't associated\nwith commercialism. The store was\nfull of people packed in between the\nracks of Bruce Springsteen CDs.\nThey played six tracks five from the\n'Frenz Experiment' (Beggars\nBanquet) and one I'd not heard\nbefore.

    "content": "vie\\ A/ STAGE\nOn Tuesday March 15th, at or around\n7.30pm the world will be taken over\nby a mad scientist. With any luck, this\nwill happen nightly, until the 18th when the curtain falls for the last time\non The Physicists, this term's production by the Dramatic Society.\nThe Physicists has a simple plot like\na Bond movie. Three really freaked-out ex-physicists are biding their time\nin a lunatic asylum by killing their\nnurses in order to take over the world.\nAfter that, comparisons with Bond\nmovies are a bit stretched. There are\na couple of guns, an evil villain and\na couple of fights. There is also a particularly blinding love scene and\nquite a few good gags, but you never\nfind these in Bond films.\nAs director of the play, the first\nthree have been more than enough\ntrouble for me. Guns are enormously\neffective stage props; they look evil,\nactors look evil with one, but only\noccasionally do they make the evil\nnoise they were intended for. I remember vividly my experience of\na failing stage gun. After two minutes\non stage as a Nazi, having trained my\ngun on the male lead for the whole\nof this time, I was about to trash him.\nWith an evil smile on my face, I pulled the trigger and the damned\nthing jammed. Quick as a flash. I hurled myself at the still unsuspecting\nmale lead and began choking him with\nmy left hand, beating his head with\nthe gun butt and shouting obscenities.\nLater on, applause all round for quick\nthinking, but the impression left in the\naudience's mind must have been 'do\nyou think the gun didn't go off? If that\nguard had intended to beat that\nprisoner's brains out he really should\nhave come on with a mace.'\nNo such problems with Phillip\nStevens' performance in the Agatha\nChristie thriller put on by Southgate\nAmateur Dramatic Society. Phillip,\nthe evil villain, was about to trash\nsome toad, so he pulled the trigger,\nno bang; Southgate Amateur Dramtic\nSociety\u2014no beginners at the art of\nstanding up in front of a lot of local\ndignitaries with make-up on and\nlooking and sounding like total\ndicks\u2014had a spare gun, which the\nstage manager had backstage. She\npulled the trigger and nothing\nhappened either. Meanwhile, back on\nstage, things are getting a bit silly.\nPhillip in a flash of inspiration starts\ntipping the wink to the other fellow\nwho, after a few words, falls flat on\nhis back. Phillip, with a wry smile,\nspins to face the audience and says\n'poisoned by God!'. That's theatre!\nStage fights can be a trifle\nhazardous too, especially if there's a bit of needle in the cast What with the\nadrenal in of performance, anything\ncan happen and on one occasion it\ndid. Again, it was Southgate Amateur\nDramatic Society who were the\nperpetrators.\nThis was that stupid scene in one\nof those Fling Henry's where Falstaff\nhad been given to George Bailey, a retired actor, who ran five\nhairdressing salons, a couple of\nboutiques and, as was revealed in the\nSunday national papers some weeks\nlater, a small child prostitution ring.\nThe Director who thought a little\ndrunken rough and tumble would\nliven the scene up, hadn't counted on\nGeorge having a grope around the\ncod pieces. Master Snare was played\nby an earnest rugby-playing bank\nclerk called Alan who took his\nmasculinity very seriously. George\nhad made a number of not\nunfavourable comparisons between\nAlan and L 'Escargot, the winner of\nthe 1976 Grand National. George had\noften tried to satisfy his curiosity in\nrehearsal, and Alan had always leapt\nto his feet screaming 'Oi! What's you f game?'. The director hoped that there\nwould be no such repetition on the\nnight. There wasn't. Master Snare hit\nFalstaff so hard his front plate swung\ninto the air as it sailed into the front\nrow and Mistress Quickly had to pour\na flagon of mead over him so he could\ncontinue the scene. That's theatre!\nSo come along and see The\nPhysicists. There's no guarantee\nyou'll get your wing-wang felt, but\nyou'll have a good laugh, and you\nnever know, if you meet some of the\ncast before the show, you might be\nable to appreciate the play's Aristotlean structure, but only if we\nlet you. See you on the night.\nRichard Debris.\nFOOTBALL\nIt is the quarter final of the FA Cup\nthis week, the last home advantage\nround and only two wins to Wembley.\nI must apologise for an error last week\nconcerning Liverpool's fixtures. This\nwas due to false information from\nBryan 'Pompey Biker' Pitts. There\nare incredibly eight matches in\nLondon including five all first\ndivision games.\nArsenal vs Nottingham Forest\nHighbury (Arsenal tube)\nThis is the tie of the round involving\ntwo of the top five teams with a strong\nchance of a Wembley victory.\nArsenal are already there in the\nLittlewoods Cup and after last week's21 win over near neighbours Spurs\nand the exceptional form of Michael\nThomas, they must hope for a win.\nForest haven't won the Cup for 29\nyears and Brian Clough has never\ntaken a team along Wembley way in\nthe greatest football competition in the\nworld. Cloughie's men kept up their\nleague challenge with a win at\nSheffield Wednesday last week, Neil\nWebb's goal fueling more speculation\nof a transfer to Italy. I am going to\nplump for a draw, probably 1-1.\nWimbledon vs Watford\nPlough Lane (Wimbledon Park tube)\nThe Windies had the three W's, well\nthis game pits together two of the first\ndivision's three W's in a Cup clash.\nWimbledon are the only top flight\nteam never to have graced Brent's number one ground. They reached\nthis round last year for the first time\nafter smashing Everton, but a bad\nperformance against Spurs ruined\nthem. A good win, although not\nexciting, against Luton gave the Dons\na grounding for this week, with that\nman Fashanu notching up number\neighteen. Watford sit at the bottom of\nthe first division and should really be\nconcentrating on keeping their top\nleague status instead of flirting with\nCup exploits. Wimbledon should\nmake history and roar into the semis\nand then go one step further.\nLeyton Orient vs Colchester\nBrisbane Road (Leytdn tube)\nOrient lost again last week and their\npromotion hopes seem to be going a burton. They are ten points off the top\nand must finish well to grab a top\nthree spot. Colchester are mid-table\nand lost at home to lowly Wrexham\non Friday night. Frank Clark must be\nhopeful of the points here and he\nshouldn't be disappointed.\nCharlton vs West Ham\nSelhurst Park (Selhurst BR)\nCharlton gained a valuable point at\nDerby last week but their survival bid\nseems impossible. They look set to\nreturn to the Valley next year, their\nold ground may give the team a new\ngoal to sav our. West Ham have a very\ntalented side but have been ho ying some steady crap recently towards\ntheir fans. Injuries have not helped\nand their desperate search for a striker\nto partner Cottee is a real sob story\nsaga. A dismal draw against Oxford\nlast week only typified things, Stuart\nRobson being the only light. I think\nthat the Hammers will get done, for\na change....\nChelsea vs Everton\nStamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)\nJohn Hollins' job at the Bridge is most\ndefinitely on the line, and without a victory since Halloween, times are\nmore than hard. They were 2-0 up\naway at Coventry last week but still\nonly came away with a draw. The\nleague champions are twenty points\noff the top and this must really hurt.\nThey were knocked out of three cups\nin eight days recently, so their season\nis certainly over. They scraped a10 win at home to Newcastle last week\nto keep up a slight challenge. I think\nEverton will take the points but\nChelsea might make them run for it.\nTottenham vs Norwich\nWhite Hart Lane (Seven Sisters tube)\nTwo mid-table sides play for points\nnot prizes with Norwich being the\nmore eager to win, needing the points\nto pull away from relegation danger.\nSpurs lost on TV last week and look\nOK but a little disjointed, Bobby\nMimms in goal having an awful\ngame. The Canaries beat Manchester\nUnited last week with Scot recruit\nRobert Fleck banging home the\nwinner. After a good season last year,\nthings have gone very wrong since\nthen. Tottenham to grab the trois\npoints.\nMillwall vs Crystal Palace\nThe Den (New Cross tube)\nThis is a much awaited game of the\nday in the second division between\ntwo promotion hopefuls from the\ncapital. This division is really hot ting up with play-off places wide open.\nThese sides are third and fourth, so\nthis is a real six-pointer. Millwall\ncould only manage a draw at\nShrewsbury last week whereas Palace\npicked up maximum points at home,\nWright getting one more; that's21 now. This will be a real ding-dong\nbattle and a prediction is only for the\nbrave. A draw!\nBrentford vs Bury\nGriffin Park (Brentford Central)\nSteve Perryman's Brentford have\nthrown away any slight promotion\nhopes they might have had, final ising in a42 defeat at Walsall last week.\nI remember Bury (the shortest club\nname in the league) losing 10-0 to\nWest Ham and are now having a mediocre season. They have ex-international Sammy Mcllroy and old\nbald y Noel Brotherstone in their\nsquad. Brentford to pick up at least\na point.\nMy last four for the Cup\nLiverpool, Arsenal (just, maybe after\na replay or two), Wimbledon and\nLuton. (Bye, bye Pompey).\n6 Friday March 11th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Alternative Andrew Daglish reveals the truth about paper recycling, life,\nthe universe and everything....\nThe truth has been revealed at last!\n'Simply recycling half the paper in\nuse in the world could meet three\nquarters of the demand for\npaper...1\n'. Hence, by recycling all\nthe paper in use in the world, 150%\nof the demand could be met. This\nmeans that, since demand is, within\nthe limits of the Heisenberg\nUncertainty Principle, not going to\nshrink to two thirds of its present level\nin the time it takes to recycle the\npaper, there is a50% increase in the\namount of paper in existence, ie, for\nevery ton, say, of paper recycled, the\nrecycle r receives 1.5 tons. This has\nstaggering implications.\nFirst, on a level of vital importance\nto every student, indeed most of the\npopulation, one need never be short\nof money again! Simply by recycling\ntwo five pound notes one will receive\nthree in return! This should see a huge\nrise in demand for paper money, but\nthis will have no long-term effect on\nour forests because the required\namount will soon be in circulation due\nto students spending 'excess' recycled\npaper money.\nHowever under no circumstances\nshould this be attempted if you are\nalready in debt, since:\nFinal amount = (initial amount x15) \u00b0 when n= number of recycles.\nHence starting in debt only increases\nthe amount of money one already\nowes, at a rate potentially far higher\nthan anything credit card companies\nhave yet been able to invent.\nIt should also be noted that applying\nthe 'recycle' principles to your cheque\nbook will probably only result in\ncatastrophic debt, since cheques have\nstill to be drawn from your account.\nHowever, they could still be useful if\none is the type that insists on writing\ncheques and one is down to one's last\ntwo cheques.\nThis in turn has important\nimplications on Government\neconomic policy. It is obvious that\nany government allowing its citizens\nto recycle money indiscriminately\n(eg, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico,\nIsrael) will be the victim of rampaging\ninflation. It becomes obvious that the\nsuccess of the Government's economic policies are due in fact to\ntheir success in suppressing the illegal\nrecycling of paper money, something\nthat many governments have failed to\ndo (eg, central European nations\nbetween the wars). This also accounts\nfor the increase in general crime: the\npolice forces have been diverted to\ntracking down recycle rs, who take\ngreat pains to conceal their\nendeavours, at the expense of tracking\ndown other criminals.\nFurther proof of this is provided by\nhistory. A study of rates of inflation\nreveals a discontinuity which cannot\nbe accounted for by mere increases\nin prices. For many years historians\nhave thought this indicated the birth\nof inordinate greed in people,\notherwise known as capitalism, but\nrecent studies in the light of the\ndiscovery of recycling has led to the\nrealisation that the discontinuity\noccurred at the same time as the\nintroduction of paper money.\nHowever, this theory has effects\npotentially far more profound than\nthose on mere fiscal policy; it is final\nand irrevocable proof of the type of\n3) the spontaneous generation\ntheory.\nThe third theory is similar to the\nfirst, ie, a universe constantly\nexpanding from its centre. The\ndifference is that the first postulates\nan initial massive explosion followed\nby an increasingly widespread and\nless dense universe, whereas the third,\npictures the universe as constantly\ngently expanding, with more matter\ncoming continually into existence\nspontaneously at the centre. This is\nin fact a special case of the type of\nuniverse we live in.\nIn fact, the universe is constantly\nexpanding but it has more than one\ncentre, and the number is variable.\nThe centres are waste-paper recycling\nmachines, and each represents a universe (microcosm) in its own right,\nwith bodies orbiting it and the other\nheavenly bodies (waste-paper baskets)\nconstantly. The case previously\npostulated could well come about in\ndue course in our own universe when\nthe operation has become centralised\nin the interest of greatest economy\nand efficiency.\nOf course, this all violates the\nconservation of mass, which was\nshown to be a load of bunkum by\nAlbert Einstein anyway. Recall that\nat extremely high velocities the mass\nchanged to negative velocity, ie, the\nparticle does work on itself on\ndecelerating. Of course work has to\nbe done on the particle in the first\nplace to accelerate the rate of\nrecycling to unusually high levels.\nPerhaps the most important\napplication of recycling is to the fossil\nfuel crisis. Even now, chemists the\nworld over are searching for ways of\nconverting paper into oil\neconomically. So long as this can be\ndone without burning more than one\nthird of the paper to provide fuel for\nthe conversion this will be viable, the\nremaining paper being recycled using\nsome of the oil to provide more paper\nthan initially, and the remaining oil\nbeing sold. Ecologists are interested\nin turning excess recycled paper into\ntrees. CERN has shown interest in\ngenerating other elements by nuclear\nfission and fusion, using paper oil to\npower the electromagnetic s in it ally, followed by fission able heavy paper\nelements when enough have been\ngenerated. Again this should be\npossible within current recycling\nlimits (a50% increase) although some\nchemists have recently reported\nimproved yields2. Of course, this has been and is\nbeing opposed by commerce,\nespecially the paper industry, which\nfears a vast slump in trade, and, more\nsinister ly, by governments on\neconomic grounds although the CIA\nis known to be a proponent of\nrecycling, to de stabilise the\neconomies of the target nations. The\nKGB is believed to be behind the\neconomic crisis in Israel, and attempts\nhave been made on the South African\none, which is more resilient due to the\nheavy usage of gold. The Australian\ngovernment has stated it believes itself\nto be the first to take steps to fully\ninsulate its economy following the\nintroduction of plastic money earlier\nthis year, but leading chemists have\npointed out that oil (from paper) may\nbe converted to plastic. This,\nhowever, is just forgery.\nuniverse we live in. The three basic\ntheories advanced thus far were:\n1) the expanding universe, or 'big\nbang', theory\n2) the oscillating universe, or 'big\nbang gn a bg ib' theory\nof a body tends to infinity. This could\nbe due to the increased rate of\nrecycling, suggesting that each\nparticle in our universe is a microcosm. The mass is decreased to\nnormal on slowing down as mass is\nReferences:\n1.

    "content": "Letters -a Wasted energy\nDear Sir,\nI am writing to complain about the large waste of energy\nin the Lyon Playfair Library. As a Life Scientist, I work\non the fourth floor of the library under increasingly\ndifficult conditions. The major problem is the air\nturbulence caused by the electric ceiling fans. These cause\npapers and books to be blown about and make working\nwithin five metres of them impossible. The reason why\nthe fans are employed, and indeed why windows are left\nwide open, is not because of the large mass of bodies\nwithin a small space, but because the central heating\nradiators are too hot to touch.\nThus, large amounts of energy are being wasted daily\nby the College in a pointless manner. Surely this could\nbe avoided by the use of simple thermostats set at a reasonable temperature.\nI cannot speak for other floors in the library, but on\nthe fourth floor, large areas of working desks cannot be\nused because of the fans, rain blowing in through open\nwindows or the intense heat from radiators. Therefore,\ncramping of many people into small areas of desks occurs,\nparticularly on Wednesday afternoons, while other areas\nare completely unpopulated due to the adverse weather\nconditions! The problem is compounded by under educated librarians who do not know how to control the fans. When\nasked politely if the fans could be turned off, a librarian\nreplied, 'they cannot be turned off, they can only be turned\ndown. And I don't know how to do it!' Does this mean\nthat the fans will be left on until Armageddon!\nThis is a very real problem and I know that a lot of\npeople feel strongly about this\u2014not only the poor working\nconditions, but also the energy wastage.\nSomething must be done about it!\nYours sincerely,\nJulian R Henson, Life Sci H. Answering the\nopinion\nDear Judith,\nThe author of last week's opinion article makes a horrific\nand perverted travesty of history by attempting to link the\nNazi policy of systematic killing of the Jews which resulted\nin six million murdered, and the conditions of the refugees\nin Gaza, Judea and Samaria.\nIt is indeed true to say conditions in the camps are poor.\nWhen Israel entered these areas in 1967 the inhabitants\nwere found, after 19 years of Arab rule, to be living in\nthe same abject squall or and misery as had existed in 1949,\nToday the camps are administered by the UN whose\nbudget has been cut in recent years as the Arab countries\nhave refused to pay the sums requested of them. One day's oil revenues of Saudi Arabia could solve the whole\nproblem.\nNotwithstanding this, Israel has engaged in a consistent\neffort to improve the living conditions. Since 1970 every\nrefugee who wishes to leave the camp is given a plot of\nland, chooses his own type of dwelling and construction\nplan and becomes the full property owner once the building\nis completed, his property being registered in the Land\nRegister. The new neighbourhoods are built orr State land\nwith water, sanitation, electricity, roads, Mosques,\nschools\u2014proper housing and infrastructure. To date the\nscheme has enabled 80,000 refugees to leave the camps.\nA little known UN Resolution has been adopted annually\nsince 1971, stating inter alia that 'Israel desist from the\nremoval and re settlement of Palestine refugees'. This year\nonly Israel and USA voted against the resolution. Is it not\nironic that those who preach about the need to overcome\nthe plight in the camps have repeatedly lent a hand to UN\nresolutions which would, if implemented, perpetuate the\nproblem?\nMr Akhtar asks 'What was preventing (Israel) from\nsolving the problems in the last thirty years?'. He\nconveniently forgets that Israel offered Gaza back to Egypt\nas part of a negotiated deal after the Six-Day War. The\nArab response was the three noes of Kartoum\u2014no talks\nwith Israel, no recognition of Israel, no peace with Israel.\nFurthermore, under the Camp David framework signed\non 17 September 1978 the Arabs of the administered areas\nwould live a transitional period of five years under the\nautonomous administrative council. The accords include\nan invitation to Palestinians and Jordanians to enter into\ndirect negotiations aimed at securing peace. Sadly the offer\nwas not accepted.\nThe PLO has eliminated itself as a negotiating partner\nnot least because of some 8,000 acts of terror, mostly\nagainst Israeli civilian targets, causing the deaths of over\n650 Israelis and the wounding of thousands more. Its\ncharter states its aims\u2014'the Arab Palestinian\npeople...reject all substitutes for the total liberation of\nPalestine'. 'Armed struggle is...the overall strategy, not\nmerely a tactical phase'. Today the PLO has not altered\nits goal one iota. It continues to deny Israel's right to exist.\nIts ambiguous rhetoric thinly disguises its glee whenever\nits killers murder Jews\u2014whether they be a crippled\npensioner on a cruise, a defenceless middle-aged woman\nin Larnaca or a baby in Nahariya.\nIn describing the recent unrest in the administered areas\nMr Akhtar does not publicise the murder by Arafat's 'Force 17' of an Israeli salesman, Shlomo Sakal. The car\naccident referred to, happened two days later\u2014the accident\nwas unintentional and the Israeli driver concerned will\nstand trial. Israel is not a totalitarian regime based on the\nrule of gun but a democracy based on the rule of law.\nWhen its security forces are faced by violent mobs, hurling\nfire-bombs, rocks and knives, then self-restraint gives way\nat times to self-preservation. But that too is subject to the\nrule of law. The Israeli soldiers involved in the burial of\nthe Palestinians are being court-martialled. Distressing\ncases of brutality by Israeli soldiers are breaches of and\nrepresent the antithesis of government policy.\nI condemn any and all excessive force. In contrast Mr\nAkhtar condones Palestinian violence. Morality which is\nselective is not morality at all. Where indeed are the\nprotests at the sieges and massacres of refugees in the\ncamps of Beirut and those of Yarmuk, Heleb and Darah\nin Syria? Suffering in Beirut does not of course justify\nhardship in Gaza\u2014but those who omit to mention the\nformer reveal anti-Israeli not humanitarian motives.\nSurely history records few people so consistently misled\nby their leadership as the Palestinian Arabs. From the\nGrand Mufti of the 30s and 40s to Yasser Arafat of today,\nrejection is m and maximal is m have gone hand in hand with\nthreats, intimidation and assassination of Palestinian Arabs\nwho espouse policies of negotiation and compromise. The\none-sided criticism of Israel by Mr Akhtar just fuels the\nobstruction of those who preach violence.

    "content": "When computers want to store large\namounts of information, they almost\nalways have to use some form of\nmagnetic recording medium.\nRecently, however, optical methods\nhave started to become more\ncommon. Recent announcement*\nfrom ICI and 3M are likely to\naccelerate the move to optical storage.\nOptical methods can pack much\nmore information into a given space\nthan magnetic devices. For example,\nan ordinary Compact Disk can store\nalmost a gigabyte (1,000,000,000\nbytes) of information or about 1000\nfloppy disks' worth. This is big\nenough to store a large encyclopaedia\nand a large dictionary, indeed such\nthings are already available for\nmicrocomputers. Disks cost about\n\u00a3100 and the drives (which can play\nyour music CD's as well) about \u00a3500.\nScientists will probably use them to\ndistribute things like Chemical\nAbstracts, which normally takes up\nabout three metres of bookshelf every\nyear. A single CD is rather smaller\nthan this and can be searched rapidly\nby computer.\nThe trouble with CDs is that you\ncan't put your own information on\nthem. You can get writable optical\ndiscs, but they cost horrendous\namounts of money and they still\ncannot be erased (though when you\nhave a gigabyte this is rarely a problem). But 3M have developed an\nerasable optical disk based on thin\nfilms of rare earth metals. Lasers\nwrite to the disk by warming a small\nspot while the disk is in a magnetic\nfield. This changes the magnetic state\nat the spot, which is detected by its\neffect on the polarisation of a weak\nlaser beam. The process is reversible\nand so the disks can be repeatedly\nreused, just like ordinary magnetic\nfloppies. They estimate that the cost\nwill be about \u00a32 per megabyte, about\nten times cheaper than conventional\nhard disks.\nConsidering all this, it may seem\nstrange that ICI has recently\nannounced a new mass storage\nmedium based on paper. Well, it's not\nordinary paper, but a plastic sandwich\nof a dye polymer. It costs about the\nsame as good quality paper to make.\nInformation is stored by burning holes\nin the dye using an infra-red laser.\nThe cost of information storage works\nout at less than lp per megabyte\n(compared to floppy disks at about \u00a31\nper megabyte for very limited\ncapacity). The paper can be made in\nvast sheets and cut into disks or long\nstrips.\nAgain, it is not erasable, but it is\nso cheap that hardly matters. The only\nproblem is that no one has built a storage device based on it yet. When\nthey do, a single reel of digital paper\nUNDER THE MICROSCOPE by Steve Black\nPlastic paper for computers\ntape will store about one terabyte of\ninformation (this is about fifty times\nmore than the sort of magnetic tape\nused as mass storage on mainframe\ncomputers; conveniently, it is about\nthe amount of satellite data NASA\nexpect to process every day by 1995).\nWhether digital paper will ever\nmake its way into the microcomputer\nmarket depends on how cheap laser-based disk or tape drives can be made.\nHopefully, whatever comes along will\nbe cheap and more robust than the\naverage floppy disk.\nPatenting Life\nIf the creationists are right about\nworld history, then American Law\ninsists that all farmers should be\npaying royalties to God.\nThe US Patent and Tradmark\nOffice has recently announced that it\nwill accept patents on genetically\naltered animals and plants. Such\nthings are now possible for ordinary\nmortals as well as the Almighty. This\nhas caused some degree of\nconsternation among religious\nfigures, who reckon that fiddling with\nlife in this way is a breach of God's copyright. However, since He forgot\nto stake his claim with the patent\noffice, no legal action is possible.\nOn the other hand, environmentalists have found other legal ways to\nobject to genetically altered beastie s. They have found various dodges to\nprevent field testing of a genetically\naltered bacterium in California (the\nbug had had its genes altered to\nprevent it making a protein that\ncaused crop-damaging ice crystals to\nform). The environmentalists were\nworried that a Frankenstein bug might\nbe released that could cause more\ntrouble than it cured.\nWe now know how to make\ngenetically altered animals as well as\nbugs. But according to the American\nPatent Office '.. .unauthorised acts of\nreproduction of patented animals\nwould seem to be an infringement of\npatent law...'. This seems likely to\ncause some annoyance to farmers,\nwho will have to enforce strict sexual\nsegregation on their beasts or pay\nroyalties on the resulting progeny.\n(Nature 331 p651) Cancer and the Voters\nThe State of California held a referendum last year on a law that\ntries to completely ban carcinogenic\nchemicals from the environment. It\nwon overwhelming support, despite\nopposition from scientists.\nThe law insists on tight control on\nchemicals known to cause cancer or\nbirth defects (for example, companies\nusing nasty compounds have to post\nwarnings in public places). This may\nseem reasonable, but it is the strict\ndefinitions in the law that make it\ndubious. They may indeed also make\nit ridiculous.\nThe law was promoted by a widespread fear that dangerous\nchemicals were being leaked into\npublic water sup lies, or used as food\nadditives and so on. The ogres of the\nchemical and electronics industries\nwere thought to be taking a cavalier\nattitude to public safety. Such an\nattitude has been worsened by the\nsecretive behaviour of the offending\ncompanies: if they had taken the effort\nto keep people informed then they\nmight never have aroused public\ndisapproval.\nThe strict limits enshrined in the\nlaw are going to make it difficult for\nsome companies to operate at all\n(even though the Governor has\ninterpreted them as loosely as\npossible). The law effectively\nassumes that any compound is\ndangerous if it causes cancer or birth\ndefects in animals at any level of\nexposure. This ignores much of the\nevidence suggesting that animal\nexperiments overestimate the danger\nof many compounds (there are some\nclassic examples of this: penicillin\nkills hamsters and aspirin kills cats).\nThe law's real mistake is that it\nassumes that all nas ties are man-made. There are plenty of pretty\nhorrible compounds that are perfectly\nnatural. Many food products contain\nsmall amounts of deadly natural\nnas ties( but not enough to do any\ndamage) that the law does nothing to\nregulate. Anyway the biggest source\nof man-made cancer is not the\nindiscriminate efforts of the chemical\nindustry, but individual choice.\nPeople choose to smoke tobacco and\nto eat unhealthy diets, they are not\nforced to do either. But no\nenvironmentalist is trying to ban\ncigarettes from sale, or to force\nMacDonalds to put health warnings\non their burgers.\nEditor's Bit\nOne of the problems in California is\nthat the scientists never bothered to\ntell the people what they were doing\nand why, so the people got\nsuspicious. Scientists have got to tell\npeople what they are about or this sort\nof thing is bound to happen.\nA good place to practice is here.\nThis very space in FELIX could be\nyours. If you have a good news story\nor a good feature article, send it to\nme (Chem Eng letter racks, the\nFELIX Office, or phone int 4642).\nSeveral people have promised me\nfeatures on various topics, but very\nfew have, as yet, materialise d. If you\nhave anything, I suggest you get it to\nme before Easter, you won't have the\ntime afterwards.\nAnd, if anyone wants to be Science\nEditor next year, now is the time to\nstart thinking about it.\n4 Friday March 11th1988 FELIX\n\n"

The Student's Union at Silwood Park is fighting to obtain\naccommodation promised by College administration for its full-time\npostgraduates following the sale of Sandyride House. Sandyride, a five acre property, was acquired by the Sherfield Trust in 1970 in\norder to provide accommodation for married overseas students but\nwas sold so that new upgraded blocks could be built. Two of these\nblocks will be completed within the next two months but Silwood\nAdministrator Mr Keith Fisher is no longer willing to guarantee that\nall these places will be available to full-time Silwood students.\nThe two new blocks contain six two- he doesn't feel that the William\nperson flats and sixteen single rooms.\nCollege Secretary John Smith told\nFELIX yesterday that the flats will be\noccupied by married students from\nSandyride and that the single rooms\nwill be used this summer to house\nshort course students. Mr Fisher said\nthat no decision had yet been made\nas to who would live in the single\nrooms after the summer.\nSilwood Union Chairman Willy\nMunro is concerned that Mr Fisher\nis not prepared to guarantee these\nplaces, especially as the Union had\nbeen led to believe that the sale of\nSandyride would create more\naccommodation for full-time students.\nHe wants as many students as possible\nfrom William Penney Hall, another\nSilwood residence which is going to\nbe refurbished this year, to be moved\nto the new block as soon as it is\ncompleted. Mr Munro believes that\nthis will give current Silwood students\nthe immediate benefit of the improved\nfacilities that the new block will\nprovide plus give sufficient places for\nshort course students.\nMr Fisher has told the Union that\nhe will not accept this plan because\nPenney rooms will be of a high\nenough standard to be used for the\npost-experience short course students.\nMr Munro has condemned this\nattitude as the new block has kitchen\nfacilities which the short course\nstudents would not need. William\nPenney, however, has very poor\nkitchens and would be much better\nsuited to short stay tenants.\nMr Fisher will not make a decision\non this matter until the two blocks\nhave been completed. Mr Munro,\nwith the backing of the South\nKensington Union, wants College's House Committee to promise that the\nblock will be made available to the\nWilliam Penney residents as soon as\nit is ready and that priority will be\ngiven to full-time students in the\nfuture.\nMr Smith told FELIX that the\nrefurbishment of William Penney\nwould take up to a year to complete.\nHe also said that there were plans to\nmake the main house into a conference centre when the Biology\nDepartment moves out and more short\ncourse accommodation would be\nbuilt.\nWill we\nCU again?\nChristian Union (CU) were thrown\nout of Imperial College Union last\nMonday when ICU Council ruled that\ntheir current constitution violates ICU\nby-laws.\nAs reported in FELIX last week,\nclauses in the CU constitution had\nbeen objected to. These clauses\nrequired all members to sign a statement of belief, required\ncommittee members to sign a further\n'doctrinal basis', and stated that any\nspeaker at CU meetings had to 'have\nviews in accordance with the doctrinal\nbasis'.\nThe ICU by-laws state that Union\nfacilities should be open to all IC\nstudents, and this had hitherto been\ninterpreted to mean that any student\nshould be allowed to join any club or\nsociety. At the Council meeting, CU\nput the case that an exception should\nbe made to this rule. They had been\nin contact with the University &\nCollege Christian Federation (UCCF)\nwho insist that Christian Unions\nwithin the federation must conform to\ntheir membership and speaker\nrestrictions. Should these be lifted,\nCU could not continue to receive\nUCCF support.\nCouncil also refused to allow the\nCU access to their allotted Union\nfunds for the remainder of the year\nas they were no longer considered to\nbe a valid Union club, but yesterday's Union Finance Committee (UFC)\nvoted to let them keep all membership\nmonies and donations which they had\ndeposited in their account this year.\nCU treasurer, Athos Ritsperis, said\nthat he had heard 'conflicting reports'\nabout the status of CU's funds for this\nyear and would not attempt to\nwithdraw any money until the matter\ncontinued on back page\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION "

The work\nis highly theatrical. The dramatic\nmusic alienated many to whom a Requiem should be an affair of\nsombre sadness and austerity. Most\nlisteners respond to its vibrant\ngrandeur, drama and sincerity. The\nwork contains huge variations in\ncolour and mood, and is highly\ndemanding for both the choir and\norchestra.

A review committee, set\nup to suggest reorganisation of earth\nscience courses throughout the\ncountry, has divided geology\ndepartments into three categories.\nWithin each type, departments have\nbeen split into two groups: the first\nto receive increased resources, the\nsecond to get no increase or a slight\nreduction. Imperial is classed in the\nsecond group of category T, which\nis meant to contribute to interdisciplinary as well as mainstream\nearth sciences, concentrating on\nmultiple rather than single honours.\nEast Anglia and Lancaster are in the\nfirst group of this type. The other\ncategories are ' M', in which\ndepartments provide teaching,\nincluding single honours, and\nresearch in mainstream earth\nsciences, and ' J', which indicates\nuniversities offering joint honours and\nservice teaching but which do not\nhave expensive research equipment.\nGroup T of type ' M' includes\nOxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh,\nLeeds, Manchester and Liverpool,\nwhile Group '2' includes Durham,\nCardiff, Leicester and Glasgow.\nA great deal of controversy\nsu rounds this review. New Scientist\nrecently published a story claiming\nthat some oil companies had been\nshown a letter stating that IC's Geology department was to be axed\ncompletely; and The Guardian,\nMarch 10th, quoted Dr Peter Smith,\nscientific editor of Geology Today, as\nsaying the review had been 'watered\ndown by a few people protecting their\nvested interests'.\nElection results ratified\nWill we CU again?\ncontinued from front page\nwas settled.

As I explained\nin the article which appeared in last\nterm's FELIX, the changes are part of\na wide ranging 'reform' of the social\nsecurity system which among other\nthings will replace supplementary benefit\nwith Income Support.\nAs far as Housing Benefit is\nconcerned, however, the main changes\naffect the method of assessment NOT\nwho is eligible. Most students,\ntherefore, will still be able to claim HB.\n(The main exceptions will be as at\npresent, those living in college halls and\nhouses and most overseas students).\nHow to work out your Housing\nBenefit after April 1st19881) Have you capital (ie savings,\nproperty, stocks and shares etc) worth\nmore than \u00a36,000?

This includes\nmoney coming into you regularly from\nany source (eg grants, bursa ries, sponsorships, covenants, parental\ncontributions, earnings from part-time\njobs, plus any income generated by\ncapital under 1) above).\nIf you are on a standard undergraduate\nmaintenance grant of \u00a32,330, this will\nwork out as income of \u00a352.92 per week\nin 1987/88 once the amounts for books\nand equipment and travel have been\ndeducted.\nAny earnings which you receive from\npart-time jobs will have a certain\namounts disregarded for purposes of this\ncalculation. These amounts are:\nSingle claimant: \u00a35 per week\nCouple: \u00a310 per week\nLone parent\nor disabled: \u00a315 per week\nNow deduct \u00a317.80 (this corresponds\nwith the student reduction in eligible\nrent).\n3) Work out your weekly rent and rates.\nIf your rent is inclusive of heating, you\nwill have to deduct an amount for this\nfrom your rent. If you do not know how\nmuch the heating element is, the local\nauthority will deduct a standard amount\n(currently.about \u00a37).\nFor calculation purposes your rent will\nbe divided into rent and rates. If you do\nnot know how much your rates are, they\nare usually 25-30% of the total rent.\nDeduct \u00a317.80 from the rent element.\nNo deductions are made from the rates.\n4) The amount of Housing Benefit you\nget will depend on the difference\nbetween your weekly income and an\nApplicable Amount which is made up\nfrom two elements.\na) A personal allowance related to\nage; whether the claimant is claiming as\none of a couple or not; and whether the\nclaimant has children or not.\nb)A premium related to family status,\ndisability and whether the claimant is a pensioner.\nIn this article I will not quote the\nApplicable Amounts for those with\nchildren or disabilities; please ask at the\nWelfare Centre for details.\nApplicable Amounts\nSingle claimant:\naged under 18 \u00a319.40\naged 18-24 inclusive \u00a326.05\naged 25 + \u00a333.40\nCouple:\nboth aged under 18 \u00a338.80\nat least one aged 18 + \u00a351.45\nOnce you have worked out your\napplicable amount you will be ready to\ndo the calculation.\n5) The calculation\nIf your income is equal to or below your\napplicable amount, you will be entitled\nto maximum HB. This will be:\n100% of rent\n80% of rates\nIf your income is above your applicable\namount you must:\nDeduct 65 % of the difference between\nyour applicable amount and your income\nfrom the maximum rent HB.\nDeduct 20% of the difference from the maximum rates HB.\nExample\nA20 year old undergraduate student's only income is his/her grant of \u00a352.92\nper week.\nS/ he pays a weekly rent exclusive of\nheating etc of \u00a340, including rates of \u00a310\nper week and is not one of a couple.\n1)Applicable amount:\nin this case it will be \u00a326.05\n2) Weekly income:\n\u00a352.92 - \u00a317.80 = \u00a335.12\n3) Eligible income:\n\u00a340 - \u00a310 - \u00a317.80 = \u00a312.20\n4) Calculation:\nDifference between Applicable Amount\nand Income = \u00a39.07\nEntitlement to Housing Benefit\nHB for rent:\n100% of eligible rent \u00a312.20\nLess 65% of \u00a39.07 - \u00a3 5.89\n\u00a3 6.31\nHB for rates:\n80% of rates\nLess 20% of \u00a39.07\nTotal HB\n\u00a3 8.00\n-\u00a3 1.81\n\u00a3 6.19\n\u00a312.50\nIn this article, I have only been able to\ngive a brief outline of the new scheme,\nif you need further information please\nask at the Welfare Centre at 15 Princes\nGardens.\nFELIX Friday March 11th19883 "

    "content": "Rev i MM.\nBarfly (cert 18)\nBarfly starts with a fight and ends with\na fight. Anything could have\nhappened in the middle and the result\nwould have been exactly the same.\nHenry Chinaski (Mickey Rourke)\nis a society drop-out who prefers the\nlow life of seedy downtown LA to the\n'unreality' of the outside world. His\nlife revolves around the bottle and he\nis at his happiest when attempting to\nbeat his enemy, Eddie the bartender,\ninto a pulp. Understandably these\nfights do not satisfy his artistic needs\nso in his spare time he writes poetry\nand short stories.\nEnter Wanda (Faye Dunaway) a very cynical drunk who is a bit crazy.\nNaturally they fall in love, albeit a strange kind of love, thriving as it\ndoes on infidelity, violence and abuse\n(Wanda must be the most blood thr is ty handbag wi elder in cinema history).\nBarfly is a strange mixture which\nleaves you puzzled at times. It is not\ntypical of the glossy production\naudiences are used to these days,\nreminding one more of a low budget\nremnant from the early seventies with\nthe music of Booker T and the MGs\nand a yellow tinge to the film.\nWhereas there was a kind of glamour\nin Mickey Rourke's sleaziness in\nAngel Heart, here there is none.\nHenry is stark and coarse. He is fat\nand greasy, a modern-day Quasimodo\nwithout the social graces. 'Why do\nyou act like a bum?' asks Tully\nSorenson, a rich literary editor,\n'Because I am a bum,' replies\nRourke. The part must have been\nwritten for him.\nThe idea of reconciling this image\nwith that of a sensitive writer is asking\ntoo much. Likewise, it is impossible\nto believe that the attractive, refined\nTully Sorenson should fall for his\ncharm, or lack of it. Henry beds her\nthen and she comes back clam our ing for more.\nVery little else happens. The\nperformances are good but the film\nis altogether too low-key for there to\nbe much else to appreciate. Ultimately\nit disappoints because so little happens\nand everyone seems quite happy\nabout the fact, especially Henry who\ncelebrates his lack of achievement by\npicking a fight with Eddie.\nDon't waste more than \u00a32 on a Monday night to see this one.\nSteve Roberts.\nSHOWING\nFatal Attraction (cert 18)\nIf you can cope with the initial tedium\nof this film while it (very slowly)\nbuilds up to the exciting if predictable\nclimax then you'll probably come out\nfeeling that it deserves its six Oscar\nnominations. I couldn't and didn't, but that puts me in a minority of one.\nSee it for yourself.\nRobocop (cert 18)\nPossibly the most violent movie due\nout this year, and no doubt the biggest\nhype. A shocking version of 'the\nfuture of law enforcement',\ndestruction interspersed with black\nhumour, sadness and a series of\nemotionally disturbing scenes. The\nonly thing our hero can't deal with is\nthe business politics which created\nhim.\nNo Way Out (cert 15)\nA spy thriller, set almost entirely in\nthe Pentagon, with brilliant\nperformances by Kevin Costner and\nHine Hackman. The nail-biting finish\nwill have you on the edge of your\nseat, and the final scene is a real\nstinger.\nCry Freedom (cert PG)\nAttenborough's poignant study of\napartheid in South Africa,\nconcentrating on the story of Donald\nWoods and his friendship with Steven\nBiko. Everything about this film is\nright, its style and execution\nespecially, and though I found it\nperhaps a touch too long, it is no\nsurprise to see it is still showing in\nLeicester Square after three months.\nWhite Mischief (cert 18)\nA fairly pointless film based quite\nloosely on a true story of murder\namongst the upper-middle classes\nduring their African holiday. Any of\nyou planning a visit to see Greta\nScaachi romping nude for an hour\u2014\nyou'll be quite disappointed.\nAndrew Clarke\nSomeone to Watch Over Me\nSomeone to Watch Over Me is another\nin a batch of recently released sex-related thrillers such as Fatal\nAttraction, No Way Out and Stakeout,\nand it suffers from comparison with\nthe rest of the pack. It hasn't the\nexcitement of Fatal Attraction, has\nnone of the intrigue of No Way Out\nand can't match Stakeout for humour.\nHaving said this, it is the maturi st attempt amongst the bunch, and deals\nwith morality better than Fatal\nAttraction ever pretended to; if not as\nwell as was possible. This makes it\nmore of a pity that it doesn't work,\nas there has recently been a dearth of\nwell-written adult-oriented films\nwhich also manage to entertain as well\nas occupy the mind (a la Angel Heart\nand Mona Lisa).\nThe story concerns itself with the\nrelationship between a newly\npromoted cop (Tom Berenger, last\nseen in Platoon) and a witness to a brutal murder (Mimi Rogers) that\nBerenger is protecting, and how this\nrelationship is threatening Berengers\nmarriage to his cop-wife (a show-stealing performance by Lorraine\nBracco).\nThe problem is that although the\ndirector, Ridley Scott (of Alien, Blade\nRunner and Legend) knows how to\nmake a film look good, he doesn't develop the relationship between the\nworking-class Berenger and the high-class Rogers with enough conviction.\nIt originally resembles Bob Hoskins\nand Cathy Tyson's mis-matched love-hate encounter in Mona Lisa\n(especially when it rips-off the 'lower-class man who doesn't know how to\nlook classy getting bought clothes by\nthe rich fashion-con cio us women'\nroutine). However it improves as the\nemotions simmer below the surface,\nand Berengers wife can detect the\nchange in him, but it finally collapses\nto a level barely above soap opera, as\na weak script finally manages to bring\nit down.\nThe action side is handled more\nconfidently as a villan looking like a psychopathic Victor Mature brings a tension to his scenes, that the rest of\nthe picture sorely lacks. And it is\nreassuring to see the grimy streets of\nNew York back in the thriller after\na period of neglect, but not even they\ncan detract your attention from the\nfact that the plot aspires to the level\nof a run-of-the-mill cop-show.\nThere are treats for the eye\n(especially when the smoke machines\ngo into overtime for the night scenes)\nand treats for the ear (i.e. Sting's rendition of the title song during the\ncredits), but I left wishing that they'd been something more for me to watch\nover.\nNoel Curry\n8 Friday March 11th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "KORFBALL\nGoing to seed\nBritish Student Championships\nOn February 27 London University\nKorfball Team (including six players\nfrom Imperial) travelled to Sheffield\nfor the British Student\nChampionships. Seeded first, they\ncompleted early victories against\nBulmarsh College (who?) 8-0,\nSheffield University 11-1 and\nLancaster University 8-1. UL then\nfaced third favourites Brighton, last\nyear's winners, started well with an\nearly goal and ruffled UL who took\ntheir time to find an equalise r. Goals\nwere exchanged quickly and at halftime UL turned around leading 3-2.\nBy the second half UL had regained\ntheir rhythm and two well-worked\nrunning-in shots produced goals.\nBrighton rallied again but UL kept\ncontrol and ran out winners 6-3 in a keenly contested game.\nIn the semi-finals UL faced Oxford\nUniversity, and, after a tentative start,\nUL romped home by 10-2. The game\nwas no preparation for the final,\nwhich cannot be said of the other\nsemi-final. By common consensus the\ngame between Brighton and York was\nthe most exciting student game seen\nfor a long time.\nAfter Brighton defeated Oxford for\nthird place, the scene was set for the\nfinal everyone was expecting: London\nversus York. York scored,\nimmediately with a long shot,\nalthough London soon equalise d. The\ngame then slowed from its initial\nfrantic pace, with Catherine Foster\nand Jacky Knowles (IC) playing\nbrilliantly in defence to prevent York\nusing their strong girls for goals, and\nthe whole team settling into a more\ntactical game. UL scored goals\nthrough Helen Grainger, top scorer\nof the tournament, Russell Norton\n(IC) and Patrick Wright (IC) and\nturned around at 4-3. At no point in\nthe game was there a difference of\nmore than one goal, and violent\ndefence from all combined with\ncontrolled attacking which resulted in\na65 lead to UL with three minutes\nleft to play. Conscious of the\nbarrack in gUL received for time-wasting at an earlier tournament, UL\ncontinued to attack defensively. The\nlast three minutes were played at such\na pace that no one really noticed the\nfinal whistle go. Relief! We'd regained our lost title, but it was just\ntoo close!\nRIFLE AND PISTOL\nSuch a card\nWednesday March 2, the date for the\nRifle and Pistol Club's match against\nReading University. The first part of\nthe match was to be rifle and shot over\ntwo cards. After the first card time\nwas running short so the second card\nwasn't shot and the scores on the first\ncard were doubled. With the best six\nscores counting this gave a fairly close\nscore out of 1200 of:\nA good all round performance by\nthe team of Paul Deeks, Andrew\nJames, Ian Draper, Mike Lacey,\nNigel Ford, Roger Winskill, AnnMarie Bruinsma, James Primrose\ngiving a final score of:\nIC\nReading\n2040\n1370\nReading\nIC\n1098\n1122\nA quick substitution of Mike Lacey\nfor Anne-Marie set us up for the pistol\npart of the match. This too was shot\nover two cards, the best six to count.\nGood performances by Paul Deeks,\nIan Draper and Roger Winskill and\nscores of 9 and 13 out of 100 by\nReading giving pistol scores out of\n1200 of:\nReading\nIC\n274\n918\nA little bit upset at being so soundly\nbeaten Reading then challenged us to\na rifle match against their ' A' team\nto be shot at Bisley and Reading. This\nwill be shot next term so look out for\nthe report.\nFinally, there are still a few places\navailable for our trip to Bisley on\nWednesday March 16. If you are\ninterested (and a member) come down\nto the range and sign up. If you're\ninterested in learning to shoot we\nalways welcome new members and\nwill be quite happy to teach you the\nbasics so come and join.\nHOCKEY Six of the best\nSix-a side hockey is a game played on\na full size pitch but with only six\nplayers, it is similar in style to seven-a side rugby, requiring a high level\nof fitness and tactical ability, at least\nthat's the theory. IC sent two sides to\nthe ULU sixes tournament (Sunday\nMarch 6), a first team and an 'all star'\nsecond team. The early games were\non a divisional round robin system,\n4 divisions made up of the 20 teams\ntaking part. IC all stars drew their first\ngame against St George's Medical\nSchool and then went downhill not\nwinning a game,\nMeanwhile however IC 1st were\ndoing a little better beating Charing\nCross by 3-1 with a couple of good\ngoals from Paul Skipworth and one\nfrom the dynamic Hari Vamadevan.\nSound defensive play by Guilds\nensured a00 draw and 6 very\nfrustrated players. IC went on to win\ntheir group winning 3 out of 4 games\nand 1 draw. There were however a few tense moments, particularly when\nJohn Stonham scored in a tight game\nagainst St Thomas's II, a good goal\nscored in injury time and one he'll no\ndoubt keep reminding us of. In the last\neight IC pal ye d RHBNC II who they\ndefeated 2-0 in a game which they\nalways had the upper hand in. Of\nparticular note was an aerial shot from\nthe hard working Justin Brooking\nwhich set up a good goal for Paul\nSkipworth. who also scored possibly\nthe best goal of the tournament, a flick\nover his left shoulder and a sweet half\nvolley, into the right hand corner of\nthe goal. The crowd went wild. I was\nunable to see their semi-final against\nQMC I, who are IC's main rivals for\nthe ULU League title this year, but\nit was at this stage that they stepped\nup a gear, scoring 3 good goals and\ntotally out-classing their opposition.\nAnd so to the final against QMC's old\nboys who included a present IC\nundergraduate Brendan Farmer.\nIC went in front early through a goal from Vamedevan, who had been\ncuriously quiet before and then had\nseveral more very good chances to\nseal it in the first half but failed to find\nthe net. Into the second half it became\nmore a game of attrition with few\n. chances and some very hard tackling\nfrom both sides, but the result was\nnever really in doubt. The final\nwhistle went and IC were champions.\nSources close to the side de cri bed their performance as 'masterful' and\nquotes like 'we're all stars' were\naudible in the bar afterwards. My\njuvenile little quips aside, it was a very good victory, something we've\nnot managed recently despite very\ngood sides in the last couple of years.\nIt must in the end go down as a team\nresult although a couple of players.\nJohn Stonham and Paul Skipworth.\nwere outstanding and occasionally\nbrilliant.\nBASKETBALL Inadequate\nThe OSC All Stars have won the first\nInternational Week Basketball\nTournament after beating Greece\n86-55 in the final, while IC Basketball\nconquered the 3rd place by defeating\nCyprus 54-32.\nAll the games were of unusually\ngood quality for British universities,\ndue to the very professional attitude\nof all the teams, referees and officials.\nIt is a shame that the College does not\nhave an adequate gym with the\nminimum required size or. at least,\nthat the necessary equipment is not\nproperly maintained and cleaned.\nThe full results were as follows:\nMonday Feb 29\nIC Basket-38 Greece-52\nOSC All Stars-86 Cyprus-38\nThursday March 3\nCypus-32 IC Basket-54\nOSC All Stars-86 Greece-55\nSAILING\nCrew cut\nIC vs Eyesores\nLast Saturday. IC sailing team raced\nagainst Eyesores at the Welsh Harp\nReservoir in Wembley. Although IC\nwere sailing well, they were narrowly\nbeaten in the morning races b\\ Eyesore's superior racing. However\nafter a change of helms IC managed\nto improve their performance. Some\nstunning sailing b\\ Sam Pace, sadly\nhandicapped b v her inexperienced\ncrew helped 1L^ to pull ahead of\nEyesore's team. Consistent sailing b\\ Jenny Burton then brought IC level\nwith Eyesore, her crew. the captain,\nproved to be rather argumentative and\nhindered Jenny's beautiful hel ming so\nteams were once again changed.\nIC then raced ahead, and thanks to\nApe sailing the correct course, finally\nbeat the Evesores in the last races.\nFELIX Friday March 11th19881 "
