Star-spangled cowboy /\nsauntering out of the almost-/\nsilly West\nYellow is never the colour of melancholy.\nYet, walking upon the Golden Jubilee\nBridges, five minutes late but, in reality,\nfifteen minutes early, a deep melancholy\nbleeds onto the Thames as I look to the\ncolossal concrete mass of Southbank\nCentre, just south of the river. This place\n\u2013 the walk from Embankment Station, up\nthestepsandtothefootbridge,delivering\nyou to a plaza just outside Southbank\nCentre \u2013 is familiar. All the stimuli are\nnow a tired formula. Zombie Londoners\nand statuesque tourists, selfie-takers and\nsaxophonists, ant trails of schoolchildren\nand the ghosts of screaming toddlers,\nand even myself upon this bridge\n(seeking an ever-so-brief respite from\nmy degree) have become wearisome. At\nnight-time however, Southbank Centre\ndoes not appear so much familiar as\nfaintly disappointing, overwhelmed\nby yellow and blue hues running up its\nsides; a commemoration of the invasion\nof Russia into Ukrainian territories.\nThe Southbank Centre is best thought\nof as a complex entity. It was originally built in 1951 as part of the Festival of\nBritain (the name \u2018Southbank Centre\u2019 itself did not come into existence until the\n\u201880s). The Centre was a remedy of sorts to\ncultural, emotional, and economic craters formed in a post-war Britain, but has\nsince evolved and matured its identity. It\nhas survived changes in administration\nand government and cemented itself as a\nplace for the foremost celebration of the\narts \u2013 particularly classical music and literature \u2013 within the continent. Its roster\nof buildings includes Royal Festival Hall\n(the only enduring remnant of its initial\nconstruction), Queen Elizabeth Hall, and\nthe Hayward Gallery, as well as being\nhome to the National Poetry Library. (Fun\nfact: I first visited Southbank Centre as\ncommended prize-winner for a national\npoetry competition).\nI am considering running. The Royal\nFestival Hall is near in sight but with the\ninternal pressure created by my simulated lateness it could be a mile away.\nIt is a building that is both pretty and\nugly. Its brutalist architectural exterior\nis hard to digest at first but creates a\nperfect antithesis to the creativity that\nit houses. It is a genius idea, although\nthe Royal Festival Hall, where I will soon\nbe awaiting Margaret Atwood, does not\nshare many of its initial design choices.\nOutside, a bust of Nelson Mandela sits\nin stoic silence, beautifully in its casted\nwrinkles lie the pledges of a sworn\npursuit to tear down the very institutions\nthat the country it sits in helped to\nconstruct. I once took a bold photo of a\nfriend sitting on a distractingly orange\nbench next to it.\nThis October 17th\n, Southbank Centre\nwill host the sixteenth edition of the\nLondon Literature Festival inside its\ncold exterior. This year\u2019s event has Jada\nPinkett-Smith headlining, with Mr. Fox\nwriter Helen Oyeyemi delivering the\nNew Statesman/Goldsmith Prize Lecture\n(perhaps Felix will fund me to attend this\nevent, having sorely missed the last one\nfeaturing Norwegian writer Karl Ove\nKnausgaard).\nIf I were to somehow miss this event\nthough, sore would not be the word to\ndescribe it. Unfortunate, possible. Frustrating, definitely. But not sore. \u2018Sore\u2019 implies the pain of having known what was\nto be missed.\nSome context for the reader: this is\nnot an event I am attending simply out of\ninterest. It is a reconnaissance mission,\nin its basest form. An opportunity to try\nnew and different things, to expand my\nliterary horizons after having (joyfully,\nI must mention) read many books of\nAfrican/postcolonial origin. Think\nChinua Achebe, Chimamanda Ngozi\nAdichie, Bessie Head. This is an era of\nnew writers I have learned about, from\nGustave Flaubert to George Saunders,\nDavid Foster Wallace to drips of Leo\nTolstoy.\nI haven\u2019t come across much Margaret\nAtwood prior to this, besides an excerpt\nhere and there, and the occasional\npoem. As much as this event exists as an\ninterview to show Atwood\u2019s publications\noff to the public, this is a personal expos\u00e9\nas well. A chance for me to circumvent\nall the writing and get to know Margaret\nAtwood herself, and whether she should\njoin this very masculine list of \u2018new\u2019\nwriters.\nIt is important to mention that the\ntime at which I am seeing Margaret Atwood is tense. On 19th\nOctober, Atwood\ntweeted on X (formerly Twitter) a link to\nan article published by Rose DiManno\non her native-Canadian news site, Toronto Star. This tweet quoted the title of\nMargaret Atwood,\nSouthbank Centre,\nBurning Questions\nA short literary\njourney.\nBOOKS\nBooksEditor\nFIYINFOLUWA OLADIPO\nShot of the Southbank Centre.

K. Rowling over\ncomments made regarding transgender\nidentity.\nNow having arrived; I ask, is Margaret\nAtwood\u2019s status as a beacon of feminism\nand, well, common sense, a question in\nthe balance? An elephant to obstruct the\nview from my seat.\nII. you are innocent as a\nbathtub / full of bullets.\nTo add colour to this (literally), I am\nin a green corduroy shirt with dark\nblue jeans; the overall look is semi-for-mal without speck of pompousness (hi\nMum!). The motif of yellow and blue\nlight shining upwards carries on into the\nRoyal Festival Hall itself, where organ\npipes reach high behind the platform\nwhere Margaret Atwood will soon be taking stage, now only by a couple chairs, a\ntable, a bottle of water that stands as the\ncentre of attention.\nThe room is predominantly female.\nMedian: middle-aged. I awkwardly\nsaunter to my seat, and I am greeted\nby mid-conversational smiles by the\ntwo women I am seated a seat away\nfrom. From here, I can view Atwood in\nher limited glory, but still overlooking\nenough of the auditorium to be able to\ncomfortably stare off into the distance\nwithout looking weird.\nI realise that most of the people are\nlikely fans of the 2017 TV series The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale or its source material\n(the overlap being considerable I\nimagine). However, this event is\nadvertised as a chance to hear Margaret\nAtwood discuss the release of her new\nbook Burning Questions and expand on\nher thoughts in her exemplary nonfiction pieces between 2004 and 2021. I\nalso realise that Atwood in this context\nis possibly fulfilling the role of writer\nmore than celebrity; less a chance to get\nto know her writing than a chance to get\nto know her, and this becomes a possibly\nsignificant confounding factor to my\nreconnaissance mission.\n\u201cThe show will be starting soon.\u201d\nThe lights dim \u2013 applause. It begins.\nEnter acclaimed novelist, Margaret\nAtwood.\nMargaret Atwood with a determined\nshuffle, gentle in her gait, but fully receptive to our wild ovation (myself in-cluded). She is dressed in all-black, a red\nscarf draped around her neck and almost\nreaching the floor. She is 82 and I imagine that the nature of this reaction is\nsomething that she knows not to move\nher core, having been subject to a multitude of awards and praise across her\nyears of writing (recently winning the\nelusive Booker Prize for her novel The\nTestaments, continuing the narrative\nset in motion by the widely adored The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale, 30 years later).\nThe event itself turns out to be not one\ninterview, but multiple. The format goes,\ni. interviewer asks Atwood a question, ii.\nAtwood responds, iii. interviewer does\nthis again, but with more gusto and a\ncurveball, iv. Atwood responds, v. the\nscreens of the Royal Festival Hall project\na famous person e.g., a poet, a politician,\nan actor \u2013 Benjamin Zephaniah, Diane\nAbbott, Ann Dowd (who plays Aunt\nLydia in the television adaptation of The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale), vi. Atwood responds.\nYou could get from this that Margaret\nAtwood is a skilful interviewee. Or that\nshe is just wise. Either one suffices.\nShe weaves Cold War-era stories with\npersonal anecdotes, and crafts each\nanswer to the audience. At some point,\nthe question of Atwood being some kind\nof modern-day Cassandra comes up (a\nfigure in Greek mythology cursed to\nspeak prophecies that would never be\nbelieved by its listeners), and she lightly\ntalks down such sinister perceptions. It\u2019s\na great interview, and one I can\u2019t seem to\ntake enough discrete notes of in a series\nof (now gone) WhatsApp messages sent\nto myself.\nThe question on her tweet on 19th\nOctober comes up, but honestly, I can\u2019t\nremember the words that were said. I\nknow these few things however: that the\ninterviewer tactfully asks the question,\npossibly wary of getting on Atwood\u2019s bad\nside, Atwood responds, and the air of the\nauditorium changes, transitioning\nfromhesitation,todissatisfaction,\nto glib acceptance.\nI particularly remember\nthat glib acceptance. The idea of\nseeking someone, a writer, out for\ntheir opinions when their writings\nprecede them seems odd. In that\ninstance it was as if a pressure had\nbeen applied to the artificiality of\ntheseevents,andtheadvertisedinsight\nit might try and provide to\nthe attendee, and under\nthis pressure it cracked\nat an undetermined\nlocation. For a good\n10 seconds. And\nwithin those\n10 seconds,\nAtwood might\nas well have\nbeen my mother\n(hi Mum!), or the\nlady I was sat a\nseat away from,\nor anybody. A\nbrief moment\nof irony; I have more to learn from my\nmother than from a paid event to see\nAtwood.\nIII. the litter of your invasions\nThe event winds down soon after.\nThings conclude. The fission reaction\nstarts thereafter. A huge congregation\nbroken down into tiny half-heard conver-sations.\nI enjoyed my time visiting Southbank\nCentre; it represented much more than\nthe single event I attended. It was a chance\nat escape, and to try something new. The\nnorthbankoftheThamesisspeckledwhite\nwith city lights.

Generally, we\nget poisoned by the food that we enjoy\ndaily due to undercooking or poor sanitation in the kitchen. Both lead to the\ncultivation of one of many bacteria that\nmakes you want to know where the closest bathroom is, just as a back-up. Since it\nis the beginning of the term, and some of\nthe newest Felix readers may never have\ncooked before, or never cooked alone\nbefore, it seems fitting to educate on the\ncauses, symptoms, and remedies of food\npoisoning.\nImagine this...\nYou have been sitting at your desk for a\nfew hours trying to comprehend triple\nintegrals when you decide to stand up\nfor a cup of coffee in your kitchen. Your\nstomach churns. You feel a pain so endearing you sit back down again. You feel\nhot, nauseous, and perhaps the need to\nvomit. And oh \u2013 you need the bathroom\nquick. You end up spending the rest of\nthe day at home. But how did this hap-pen?\nThree ways to get food poisoning\nA general understanding of food poisoning occurs when food is not safe to eat.\nThis could be due to one of three reasons.\nFirst, the kitchen or area in which the\nfood has been prepared is not cleaned\nwell enough such that the bacteria from\nother foods, hands or objects (phones,\nwallets) are easily spread from the containers to the hands of the people preparing the food to the knives, fridge door,\nlight-switch, or water tap. The bacteria\nstart spreading quickly in the kitchen.\nSecondly, the food is undercooked. Each\nbacterium dies at a specific temperature\nrange (roughly 75\u00b0C for meat) and if the\nfood is prepared below that temperature,\nyou may think your burger is ready, when\nit really isnt. The recent documentary\nPoisoned \u2013 The Dirty Truth About Your Food\non Netflix can give a good explanation as\nto why this may occur when eating out.\nLastly, the food has expired.\nBest Before, Use By and May\nContain\nSimple to explain, the \u2018Best Before\u2019 date\nindicates quality and is often meant for\nfrozen, tinned, or dried foods which can\nlast quite a while \u2013 for example, spices\nor pasta. The \u2018Use By\u2019 date is meant for\nsafety and food should not be consumed\npast that date. This is not a discussion.\nEven if your grand-aunt who has cooked\nfor fifty years, and who has the nose of a\nhunter-dog says the cheese is fine, please\ndo not eat it. If you are interested in this,\ncheck out the start-up BlakBear \u2013 an Imperial start-up developing in-package\nsensor for real-time evaluation of if the\nmeat is spoiled. Furthermore, the food\nneeds to be stored correctly for the \u2018Use\nBy\u201d date to be accurate, so check the label for storage means. The \u2018May Contain\u2019 label on the back of the packet is a\nlegal issue. For companies to avoid being\nsued due to cross-contamination of food\nduring industrial productions, the \u2018May\nContain\u2019 label may say \u2018May contain soya\u2019\nwhen you are eating a simple bag of pop-corn.\nFoul foes\nThe Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that there are four\nprominent bacteria found in our food.\nFirst, the Norovirus and Salmonella are\nsimilar illnesses (though Salmonella is\na bacteria, while Norovirus is a virus)\nas they portray the same symptoms of\nnausea, loose stool, vomiting, headache,\nfever and tiredness. Symptoms appear\nroughly one to two days post infection\nand are easily spread by close contract\nor touching the same surface (e.g. in the\nkitchen or bathroom). Norovirus is the\nofficial name of the winter vomiting bug\nor stomach bug\u2019 and is the most common\nFoul food\nor bad buy?\nFood&TravelEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nLiving by yourself means you should\ntake care of your physical, mental\nand importantly, your gut health.\nFollow these 4 simple steps to help reduce foodborne illnesses\nCLEAN\nCLEAN\nFOOD SAFETY GUIDE\nBefore, during and after\nyou prepare food, wash\nyour hands with soap\nand water for at least\n20 seconds\nWash utensils, cutting\nboards and counter tops\nwith hot soapy water\nRinse fresh fruits\nand vegetables\nunder running\nwater before\neating or cutting\nDo not wash meat,\npoultry or eggs\n40\u00b0F\nSet your refrigerator\nat 40\u00b0F or lower\nRefrigerate perishable\nfood within 2 hours\nDefrost and\nthaw frozen\nfood in the\nrefrigerator\nDo not defrost and thaw\nfood on the counter.\nBacteria can grow rapidly\nwhen food is kept at room\ntemperature\nUse a meat\nthermometer to\nensure food is\ncooked to a safe\ninternal temperature\nbefore consuming\n145\u00b0F\nWhole cuts of beef, pork, veal and\nlamb (allow to rest for 3 minutes\nbefore eating)\n165\u00b0F\nAll poultry, including\nground chicken and turkey\n145\u00b0F\nFish (or cook until flesh is opaque)\n165\u00b0F\nLeftovers and casseroles\n145\u00b0F\nFresh pork, including fresh ham (allow\nto rest for 3 minutes before eating)\n160\u00b0F\nGround meat such\nas beef and pork\nWhen preparing,\nstoring and cutting\nfood, separate raw\nmeat, poultry,\nseafood and eggs\nfrom fruits and\nvegetables\nUse separate cutting boards, plates\nand knives when preparing meat\nKeep raw meat, poultry,\nseafood and eggs separated\nfrom other food in your shopping\ncart and refrigerator\nFOOD SAFETY GUIDE\nAmerican Institute for Cancer Research | PO Box 97167,Washington, DC 20090-7167 | 800-843-8114 | aicr.org\nBuoyHealth.com\nInforgraphic on the 4 principals of food safety.

For new fans, I\u2019ll\ngive you the rundown. In 2018, I saw the band Bad\nSounds, and all the trains home were cancelled. I got\nstuck in Leeds, and it was a nightmare (a more descriptive version of the night can be found in Issue 1788).\nHowever, last night was a dream. The train departed\non time, and arrived on time: and that still wasn\u2019t the\nbest thing to happen all night. The best thing to happen\nall night happened roughly two hours before I entered\nLeeds station \u2013 Slaughter Beach, Dog walked onto the\nstage.\nCreated during the indefinite hiatus of the band\nModern Baseball (MOBO), Slaughter Beach, Dog is the\ncurrent project of Jake Ewald and Ian Farmer (former\nMOBO singer and bassist). The new band has a much\nfolksier sound than Modern Baseball did, with fewer\nsongs resulting in mosh pits yet just as many songs resulting in tears.\nThe set list was bulked out with new tracks from the\nband\u2019s recent album Crying, Laughing, Waving, Smiling.\nConsidering it was only released under a week ago, the\ncrowd got involved. Maybe it\u2019s Northern crowds, maybe\nit\u2019s the undying, endearing community still obsessed\nwith any sign of a Modern Baseball reunion. One thing\ndoes continue from Modern Baseball\u2019s music and that\u2019s\nthe catharsis of watching and experiencing the band\nperform.\nListening to \u201c104 Degrees\u201d in the Leeds Irish Centre the bartenders questioned why people would come\nwatch a band where the drummer can\u2019t drum, the bass\nplayer can\u2019t play, the guitarist only has one riff, and the\nsinger is an utter buffoon, unimaginable amounts of energy were released.\nAll I can suggest is to watch the band live on YouTube\nas Spotify recordings do not do them justice. The community and mythos surrounding the band is so strong\nand I experienced that last night for the first time. Even\nthough I wish I could have seen Modern Baseball per-form, Slaughter Beach, Dog are the natural progression,\nliving up to the hype.\nPhiladelphia Indie\nRock Band Slaughter\nBeach, Dog, killed it\nat Leeds Irish Centre.\nSlaughter Leeds, Dawg\nMusicEditor\nJOE RIORDAN\nMUSIC\nJoe Riordan\nJoe Riordan\n\n"

First of all,\nmost enjoyed when there were more people per stand\navailable to talk to. Since the Union\u2019s policy limited\nstalls to two committee members at a time, it became\nextremely difficult to talk to everyone before some\npromptly turned around and left before even taking a\nsticker. Furthermore, visitors did not enjoy QR codes being pushed into their faces even after expressing their\ndisinterest in a society. Societies aim to get as many\nsign-ups as a way to inflate their importance, but we\nall know that quality matters more than quantity. The\nother issue is funding; the larger the member pool, the\nmore funding a society can claim from the Union, which\nis something we all strive for. Luckily, the Union finds a\nway to finance all societies through various funds and\ngrants, hence we do not need to empty our personal\npockets for our passions.\nThe fair spans all four corners of the South Kensington campus. As usual, the Cultural (Global) and Sport\nsocieties were located outside, as they are the biggest\ngroups to cover. This year, the weather decided to shift\ninto a slight rain at 2pm, dowsing hundreds of students,\ntheir posters, and their food. Luckily, the weather slowed\ndown around 3pm and the sun blessed us all for the final\nhours of the fair. Around 4pm, the hype had died down\nand some societies decided to pack up. The bustle and\nmass movement of the fair always creates a high-energy\nevent that requires lots of socialisation, smiles, repetition of pitches and conversations.\nMost students finish the day with stickers, posters,\npens, and merchandise from at least 10 different societies that they promised to check out later. Their true loyalties will reveal themselves the week after tryouts and\nwelcome socials. I don\u2019t blame any Freshers who may\nhave felt overwhelmed with information and faces after\nTuesday. We all agree that Freshers\u2019 Fair is the most fast-paced day in a full week of fast-paced introductions. So,\nas I mentioned in Issue 1827, try out as many societies as\nyou want this week, but try not to overcommit yourself.\nLast, but most certainly not least, it is never too late\nto join a society. There are more than enough resources\nto by which to contact them (Union pages, email, Instagram, Facebook, X) and get involved. Perhaps you want\nto wait out this year and get settled at Imperial, then join\na society or two next year.

Each society received one\ntable and was allowed two members at a time to pitch\ntheir unique society to anybody passing by. All the societies were split into various zones by theme; Creative and\nHobbies, Global (Cultural), Community, Partners of Imperial, Careers & Skills, Academic, Campagins & Liberation and as usual, Sports and Medics. Compared to last\nyear, more space was allocated to each stall, which was\ngreatly appreciated and hopefully will be improved on\nagain next year. Last year, the walkway across Queen\u2019s\nLawn was as congested as a tube station after a Harry\nStyles concert.\nAs usual, most stands try to present themselves three-fold; their past, their concept, and their future plans.\nThe past might include trophies, successful shows, im-pactful speakers that visited, or competitions that they\nwon.\nConcept is pretty simple; most of the time, the name\nof the society gives away their purpose. However, sometimes that isn\u2019t so clear \u2013 take us for example, as Felix is\nnot a cat food society, but the student newspaper. Pint of\nScience is a society dedicated to going to pubs to discuss\nscientific topics among peers.\nFuture plans most often include a schedule of each\nterm\u2019s major activities, events, and socials. For example,\nthe Volleyball society is already planning a trip to Portugal in April.\nThis year, I decided to interview some of the stallhold-ers and some of the people walking around. When asked\nwhat students focus on when pitching their society, the\nmain one was on promoting social events and explaining costs. With the rising cost of living, a \u00a345 membership may be too much for some students (see News on\np.7). Some societies split their membership into a lower\nannual fee and a higher monthly fee, to give some members flexibility to pay when they can. The most expensive societies are sports societies, as their memberships\ngenerally cover transportation costs, league member-ships, and equipment costs.\nSOCIETIES\nFresher minds, Fresher air,\neveryone\u2019s aboard for Freshers\u2019 Fair\nSocietiesEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nLeft: Dalby Court transformed into a great hall of flags and languages from all around the world.

I\nwas struck by how many students stopped\nby Felix\u2019s stall this year.\nThe Felix society has, at the time of writ-ing, 139 members; over 50% more than at\nthe same point in time last year. I am greatly encouraged by the fact that so many students are interested in learning more about\nboth the paper and news at the College.\nMy own journey to the paper and to the\nposition of Editor-in-Chief was unlikely. I\nhave always loved writing, and was an avid\nreader before joining university, but upon\njoining Imperial, I largely gave up those in-terests, sacrificing them in order to focus\non my degree.\nAfter long days of lectures and problem\nsheets, I had very little motivation to read\nor write. But in my second year, I wanted\nto challenge myself and start writing again,\nand so I joined Felix.\nI joined the paper in late October of\n2020, when COVID-19 was spreading rapidly across the country, and scientists were\npredicting a winter NHS meltdown. The\ncountry was just about to go into a second lockdown, and Imperial was delivering\nits courses remotely. Consequently, I had\nvery little contact with the editorial team\nat Felix; all editing and copyediting was\ndone remotely. We would access the Felix computers remotely using TeamViewer,\nand I remember there being a lag between\nmy computer and the remote desktop that\nmade copyediting very frustrating.\nNevertheless, the role proved to still be\nan excellent introduction to the paper; I\nlearned how to use Adobe InDesign, - the\nsoftware we use to lay out the paper - and\nbegan to understand what goes into producing a newspaper, and the type of content within it.\nFrom there, I took on more responsi-bility, becoming Science Editor, and then\nlast year, a news writer and Deputy Editor-in-Chief. Over the past two years of\nin-person involvement with the paper, the\nthing I have enjoyed most is the camaraderie and sense of community \u2013 a stark contrast from those early pandemic days. I had\nnever been a particularly outgoing person\nbefore joining the paper, nor had I been especially interested in news. But at Felix, I\nfound a friendly group of people who were\nwilling to trust me with responsibility, and\nnurture and foster whatever nascent skills\nI did have.\nThis week, our office in West Basement\n(Beit Quad) was the busiest I have ever\nseen it. The more senior editors among\nus were excited to see so many people\nbrought together over our shared passion\nfor writing.\nI hope that if you visited our Freshers\u2019\nFair stall, heard about Felix at your departmental welcome talks this week, or saw the\npaper in your student halls, you got at least\nsome sense of that passion. If you haven\u2019t\nalready, join our society on the Union\u2019s\neActivities page, and email me (felix@im-perial.ac.uk) if you\u2019d like to write for us.\nEDITORIAL\nVACANCIES\nWe are always looking for new\nrecruits! If you\u2019re interested in\ngetting involved and don\u2019t see\na role you fancy here, drop us a\nmessage at felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCopyeditors\nPhotographers\nNews Writers\nEditors\nScience\nArts\nMusic\nFilm&TV\nSports\nWriters\nScience\nArts\nBooks\nFilm&TV\nSocieties\nSports\n\n"

That doesn\u2019t mean, to search for\naliens in that sense \u2013 but we do have on the Webb telescope equipment that can look for signatures that\ncould enable life to be sustained elsewhere. Bringing\nback samples from an asteroid, which originates from\nthe very beginning of our solar system when our planets were forming - we think it will have signatures in\nthere which maybe will tell us why planets form, and\nwhy we can sustain water and therefore why we can\nsustain life\u201d.\n\u201cWe can look at [OSIRIS-Rex] for many reasons:\nlooking for what are the building blocks for early\nplanet formation, in the 22nd\ncentury Bennu will be\non a close trajectory to Earth \u2013 so learning what the\nasteroid is like means that we could design a mission,\nif we needed to actually move the asteroid away.\u201d\nOSIRIS-REx stands for the Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security Regolith\nExplorer. Each of the words in the acronym was chosen to represent an aspect of this mission. \u201cS\u201d for\nsecurity represents one of the most important aspects\nof the mission, the security of Earth from hazardous\nNEOs. The spacecraft will allow scientists to better\nunderstand the Yarkovsky effect, the force exerted\non an object when sunlight is absorbed and released.\nWhen sunlight hits a rotating object like Bennu, the\nday side heats up; and as the asteroid turns, the night\nside cools and releases heat; resulting in a thrust force.\nThis small amount of thrust can alter the trajectories\nof orbiting bodies over time. Utilising this effect is\none scenario currently under investigation to alter the\ncourse of potentially Earth-impacting NEOs. Possible\nstrategies implementing the Yarkovsky effect include\npainting: the surface of the asteroid or focusing solar\nradiation onto the asteroid to alter the intensity of the\nYarkovsky effect, to diver the asteroid away from a collision the Earth.\nScientists will now analyse this sample at the Natural History Museum. Speaking with BBC News, Prof.\nSarah Russell at the museum adds: \u201cWe know from\nlooking at meteorites that asteroids are likely to contain a zoo of different organic molecules. But in me-teorites, they\u2019re often very contaminated, and so this\nsample return gives us a chance to really find out what\nthe pristine organic components of Bennu are.\u201d\nOn 25th\nApril 2022, NASA confirmed an extension to\nthe mission. After dropping off the sample on Earth,\nOSIRIS-REx became OSIRIS-APEX (\u2018Apophis Explorer\u2019), who\u2019s target is much like Bennu, a near-Earth\nasteroid called 99942 Apophis. Apophis will have an\nextremely close pass by of Earth on 8th\nApril 2029, with\nOSIRIS-APEX planning to rendezvous with the asteroid a few days later, on 21st\nApril 2029.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n6 | NEWS 6 October 2023\nThis year, the show underwent a revamp: long-time\npresenterJeremyPaxmanleft,andwasreplacedbyAmol\nRajan, BBC Media Editor and former editor-in-chief of\nThe Independent newspaper. Paxman was renowned\nfor his withering retorts to participants (\u201cThat is a\ncompletely useless answer\u201d, \u201cOnly out by 600 years or\nso\u201d). Rajan, in contrast, was encouraging, and, behind\nthe scenes, says the team, very nervous.\nImperial\u2019s team has an illustrious past, sharing\nthe record for most series wins (four) with Magdalen\nCollege, Oxford, and the University of Manchester.\nUnlike Magdalen and Manchester, who last won in 2013\nand 2011 respectively, Imperial\u2019s last victories came\nmore recently, in 2022 and 2020. Those wins featured\nUniversity Challenge legends like Michael Kohn and\nBrandon Blackwell. Blackwell built up a following\nduring his time on the show and became affectionately\nknown as \u2018Imperial Brandon\u2019. He was a contestant on\nWho Wants To Be A Millionaire in 2012, winning $43,100,\nand in 2022, starred on The Chase USA as a \u2018Chaser\u2019.\nDid the team feel pressure to live up to this legacy?\nNot initially, says Suraiya. \u201cI just wanted us to enjoy\nthe first round, and not to lose.\u201d\nJustin smiles in agreement. \u201cYeah, the pressure of the\nlegacy might have been stressful, but it\u2019s significantly\nless stressful than worrying about not making a\ncomplete fool of yourself on TV.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough in that first introduction to the team,\nyou don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to say\u201d, continues\nSuraiya. \u201cAnd Amol Rajan said, \u2018Oh yeah, they\u2019ve won it\nfour times.\u2019 It was such a hyped-up introduction to the\nteam that then I was like, \u2018Now I\u2019m a bit more nervous.\u2019\u201d\nIn fact, one previous Imperial University Challenge\nwinner was a big help in training this year\u2019s team, says\nSourajit.\n\u201cEven though she had graduated, Fatima Sheriff\n[a 2022 winner] would come to college for our weekly\npractice session. She was in contact with us all the time,\nand would help us sidestep a lot of the \u2018local minima\u2019\nwe would have been stuck in otherwise. We didn\u2019t have\nto face some of the problems other teams did, because\nwe already knew what to expect and how to go about\nthings.\u201d\nImperial\u2019s quizzing success is all the more\nextraordinary given the College\u2019s focus on STEM. Other\nuniversity quiz teams benefit from a more academically-diverse talent pool, with the ability to recruit students\nstudying humanities and arts subjects.\nAdam sees this as an advantage: \u201cYou\u2019re more likely\nto find STEM students who come home and read a book,\nor watch a film, than you are to find humanities students\nwho get back and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to write some computer\nprograms.\u2019\u201d This, suggests the team, gives each of them\na broader overall knowledge base.\nIn their first round this year, Imperial dominated\nBalliol College, Oxford, scoring 285 to Balliol\u2019s 145. Their\nsuccess came in part due to the speed with which they\nresponded, consistently beating Balliol to the buzzer\nand then capitalising on the bonus questions which\nfollowed.\nUniversity Challenge rounds follow a relatively simple\nformat: each round has its own theme, and teams are\nasked a series of \u2018starter\u2019 questions. The first team to\nbuzz in has the opportunity to answer the question. A\ncorrect answer is rewarded with 10 points, and three\nbonus questions, worth five points each. Interrupting\na starter question with an incorrect answer is penalised\nwith a five-point deduction.\n\u201cYou have to out-buzz the other team,\u201d says Suraiya,\nwhen I ask about the team\u2019s strategy. \u201cBut on an\nindividual level, the calculation we\u2019re all making is,\n\u2018Do I buzz early [before the question has been read out\nin full], or do I wait for confirmation in the stem of the\nquestion and buzz?\u2019\u201d\nReserve Mattia was an important part of the strategy,\nattending the televised rounds and playing the role of\nthe opposition in practice sessions. \u201cI was always with\nthe team,\u201d he says, \u201cIn the studio and out \u2013 constantly\nwriting things down, making notes of weaknesses\u201d.\nDuring practice sessions, the team would watch old\nUniversity Challenge episodes and try to buzz in before\nthose on screen. \u201cIt was basically four against nine \u2013 the\ntwo teams on screen, plus me,\u201d says Mattia.\nThe captain serves a key role, particularly in bonus\nrounds, in which they give a final answer after the team\nconfers, or nominate another member to respond in\ntheirplace.Theyareselectedfortheirabilitytomaintain\na cool head, make good judgement calls under pressure,\nand communicate effectively.\n\u201cAs the captain, I have to assess whether we are\nactually going to get to the answer in time, or whether\nwe should just move on and get a new question that we\nmight get right,\u201d explains Suraiya.\nTogether with the rest of the team, the captain is\npickedbyaselectionpanelconsistingofformerImperial\nUniversity Challenge competitors, and sometimes Quiz\nSociety committee members.\nThe internal selection process consists of two rounds.\nThe first takes place in late October; applicants are\nasked to write down their answers to 100 questions,\nand around 15 high-scoring individuals are admitted to\nthe second round in November. This round mimics the\nformat of the University Challenge show; candidates are\nsorted into teams of four, and team members are cycled\nin and out to see how effectively they work together. The\nfinal four are selected not only for their individual skills,\nbut their ability to function as a unit.\nTheteamistheninterviewedbytheBBCshowrunners,\nwho select 28 university teams to appear on the show\nfrom over 100 applicants.\nFilming takes place over three weekends, beginning\nat the end of February, but competitors are not allowed\nto announce the results to anyone but family and close\nfriends.\nThe team this year comes from a diverse range of\nbackgrounds: Sourajit, for example, worked as an\nengineer for India\u2019s space agency for two and a half\nyears before joining Imperial. They all agree that prior\nexperience quizzing is critical, but whereas Justin first\nstarted quizzing competitively at school in Brighton,\nAdam only began at university.\nBeing inquisitive, they say, is the best way to get better\nat quizzing. \u201cI think the main reason why I\u2019m quite good\nat quizzes in general is just that whenever I hear about\nsomething that mildly interests me, I just look it up on\nWikipedia and immediately go down a vortex of stuff\nwhere you\u2019re led from one thing to another,\u201d says Mattia.\nBeyond that, joining Quiz Society and participating\nin their events is an effective way to build speed and\naccuracy on the buzzer. Not every team member was\npart of Quiz Society before they went to trials, but, says\nJustin, \u201cYou get to know people in the quiz circuit, and to\nfeel your finger on the buzzer for the first time.\u201d\nImperial will appear next on University Challenge in the\nnew year. If you would like to be a part of the 2024 team,\ntrials will be held on 24th\nand 31st\nOctober on the South\nKensington campus, 26th\nin Charing Cross, and 27th\nin White\nCity.

At the same time, this age category is\nmore left wing than any other before it. A recent YouGov poll found a 75-point difference in voting intentions\nbetween left- and right-wing parties among 18\u201324-yearolds. In my own experience\namong students, exhortations on the rights of workers\nare common while radical\nbeliefs such as a call for revolution go unremarked. While\none could argue from these\nstatistics that a hard-core libertarian minority are keen on\nboth Thatcher and ketamine,\nmy experience has been that\ntaking drugs has become associated with the left. The\nmoral and political basis for\nthis however, remains unclear. The few people who\nhave given the matter any thought, claim to channel the\n60\u2019s belief in political psychedelic experience, that drug\ntaking is a path to political and spiritual freedom. I be-lieve, however, that the vast majority simply subscribe\nto a libertarian consent-based view, and that they should\nbe able to do whatever they like with their own bodies.\nThere seems to me to be a fundamental contradiction\nbetween the left wing and pro-drug positions. Drugs\nand the estimated $32 billion international narcotics\ntrade, cause untold damage to people\u2019s live and disproportionately affect the global working class. By purchasing illicit drugs, one is giving money to institutions that\nhave supported guerilla warfare and cartel violence in\nSouth America, the eradication of women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan and closer to home, violent deaths and incarceration of young, often black men, in the West. The vast\nsums of money involved in the trade have been used to\nbribe officials the world over, not only weakening often\nprecarious national bureaucracies around the world but\nalso providing a route for the smuggling of vulnerable\npeople for sexual exploitation and the movement of\nweapons for organised crime. Finally, the widespread\navailability of powerful narcotics has made lives harder for addicts and those inclined to addiction resulting\nin X increase in addicts, many of whom are poor, and\nworking class.\nSo how is it that while cartels and their adjacent organisations cause incredible harm to working class\npeople, the bien-pensant classes refuse to turn against\ndrugs?\nThe common argument\nmade against these claims\nis that legalisation would remove the stain of organised\ncrime from what is essentially a benign and harmless\ntrade. However, the evidence\ncoming out of Oregon, an\nearly adopter of marijuana\nlegalisation and drug de-criminalisation has told a\ndifferent story. Instead of a\nsmoky and giggly utopia, fatal drug overdoses have gone\nup 23% as drugs have flooded into the state. At the same\ntime, legal growers of marijuana have found themselves\npriced out of the market by illegal growers who can now\nmore easily hide their crop. The population of the state\nhas also regretted its decision, with 63% of voters now\ncalling for the revoking of the previous ballot measure.\nIn hindsight it is not difficult to figure out why. When\naddicts and dealers have less reason to be afraid of the\npolice, they will carry more drugs. When police cease to\ntake drugs off the streets in seizures, there will also be\nmore drugs for addicts to take, causing more overdoses\nand family tragedies.\nNo left-winger\nshould ever take\ndrugs\nCommentWriter\nCALUM DRYSDALE\nLittle bit of late night fun. Shravan Sharma\nAnyone who claims\na serious belief in the\ninterests of workers\nshould avoid drugs and\ncondemn thosethat take\nthem as individualistic\nmaterialists\n\u201c\n\n"

Together this works as a\nmechanism for foreshadowing and setting the overall tone for the opera which\nimmediately gauges our interests and\nsets our expectations for the night ahead.\nThis, in tandem with the set design and\nLoy\u2019s choice to use film of the \u2018gunshot\u2019\nscene, provides us with a production that\nreminds us of subtle themes such as reli-gion, absence, and death while we sit and\nindulge in mellifluous arias detailing\nhonour, revenge and love.\nThe roles of Leonora and Don Alvaro\nare played by Sondra Radvanovsky and\nBrian Jagde; of which both show great\nmusicality and fortitude in their singing and acting. However, their particular\nportrayal of Verdi\u2019s classic soprano and\ntenor are somewhat unyielding. They fall\ninto the trap of providing too much force\nwith their singing, and it was apparent in\nthe third act that Brian lacked control of\nhis upper register during the more sensitive passages, leading to two voice breaks\nin his passagio.\nUnfortunately, both must relinquish\npride and place to Etienne Dupuis\u2019 \u2018Don\nVargas\u2019 and Rodion Pogossov\u2019s \u2018Melitone\u2019; Dupuis provides a much-needed\nsentimentality and emotionally-driven\nstyle of singing while Pogossov provides\na more agitated tone that complements\n\u2018Melitone\u2019s sarcastic and grating nature.\nSpecial mention must be given to\nOtto Pichler\u2019s choreography for the pro-duction, which expertly drives the third\nact in particular. The chorus and choreo\ntroupe shine through with their expert\nblend of cabaret and Turkic dance, that\nenergises the scene with both a mystical and sensual quality bestowing a carnal quality to the story to contrast with\nthe more romantic and chivalric love\nportrayed in the music. Mark Elder masterfully directs the Royal Opera House\n(ROH) Orchestra with exemplary quali-ty; his direction of the woodwind section\nand their frequent solos was done with a\ngrace and masterful skill that have come\nto be expected of him.

Dinosaurs shared many similar\nanatomical features with birds, and so\nOstrom became the first to depict a dinosaur as a swift, agile, bird-like creature,\nand soon others, like Robert Bakker and\nSarah Landry (the first to depict a feathered dinosaur), followed suit.\nThese new depictions became what\nis known as \u2018The Dinosaur Renaissance\u2019\nand resulted in an outpour of new dino-saur-related media and interest, such as\nthe 1990 Michale Crichton novel Jurassic\nPark. To top it off, the discovery, in Liaoning Province, China, of a Lagerstatte\n(a rock formation containing extraordinarily preserved specimens) showed\nthat a significant number of well-known\nspecies like the Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor were also coated with feathers.\nThis change in the artistic depiction of\ndinosaurs can be seen when comparing\nthe designs used for Jurassic Park: The\nLost World to Jurassic Park III.\nPaleoart has a powerful hand in how\nwe visualise ancient life; from early depictions of apocalyptic hellscapes and\ndragon-like monsters, to flourishing jungles filled with feathered fauna. With its\npowerful imagery, it led to a resurgence\nof interest in the 1970s, prompting numerous books and films about the ancient world, and it has got to the point\nwhere it is rare for even a child to not be\nexposed to dinosaur depictions. However, the joys of being able to see into this\nworld could not have been possible without the significant artistic contribution\nfrom paleoartists; to be able to visualise\nwhole ecosystems and worlds from nothing but bones and imprints, and depict\nthem on canvas is proof that they hold a\nplace amongst the greatest artists.\nStill from Jurassic Park.

After a rather\nmiraculous application process for medical school, Imperial was the place that offered me the chance to spend the next 6\nyears of my life studying the course I had\ndreamed of as a child. I also got to study\nin London, which was a big bonus for me\nas it meant one thing; I would meet black\npeople.\nDuring my school years, I could count\non one hand the number of people in my\nyear at school who came from a similar\nbackground to me, or looked like me.\nAnd whilst that did not necessarily hinder my social experiences growing up, I\ncould not help but feel that moving to the\ncity where most of the young black population is concentrated would be the best\nchoice for me. Throughout my teenage\nyears I had envisioned what I wanted my\ntwenties to look like. I desired a new environment \u2014 and Imperial was just that.\nI was exposed to a completely new\nworld, a place where I could relate to\npeople \u2014 not just socially or emotional-ly, but also culturally. I felt empowered,\nbeing surrounded by such intelligent\nand creative black individuals. They\nalso knew how to have a good time. The\nevents put on by the University of London Afro-Caribbean society were amaz-ing, I got to dance with my friends and\nenjoy the distinctive sounds of afrobeats\nand amapiano- which was a nice break\nfrom the \u2018oontz oontz\u2019 of a regular night-club. Imperial\u2019s ACS provided me with a\nsense of community and a space to connect with other black students studying\nother courses. Through them I would\nmeet my ACS parent, and now President,\nTani. She gave me encouragement and\nsupport throughout my first year, which\nI am eternally grateful for. It also gave\nme a space to connect with my faith, as\nImperial Gospel Choir held amazing con-certs, with vocals reminiscent of the CDs\nmy father used to play in the car as he\ndrove me to school.\nFootball is a sport I enjoy playing and\nwatching, and so naturally I joined Imperial Medics Women\u2019s Football. It gave\nme insight into the realm of university\nsports and whilst I am still yet to attend\n\u2018Slug\u2019, the nightclub medic athletes attend on a Wednesday night, I am incredibly grateful that I have a space for myself\nto enjoy my hobbies and step back from\nmedicine.\nMoving to London also allowed me\nto try out new things, leading to me developing interests in fashion and mu-sic. Being the creative director and host\nof ICSM Fashion Show was one of my\nproudest moments last year. It encouraged me to leave my comfort zone and\nexperiment with my style. Whilst I may\nnot become the next Martine Rose or Virgil Abloh, I\u2019m very proud of my growth\nin confidence and ability to give things a\ngo. As a black girl, growing up, I felt the\nneed to minimise myself and not take up\nspace. The idea of being visible was uncomfortable to me. Being at Imperial has\ngiven me that confidence to stand out\n\u2014 to defy my subconscious constraints\nand what I perceived as society\u2019s expectations of me.\nAs I embark on my second year, I hope\nto continue down this path of growth and\nself-discovery. I believe my identity as a\nblack person is something to be proud\nof. I want to continue sharing my culture\nwith others and also learn more about it.\nI want to be the type of person younger\nTomi would look up to. I want to enter\nspaces I had never dreamed of entering\nbefore- and I am sure I am at the right\nUniversity to do so.\nBlack, young\nand ambitious\nCOMMENT\nCommentWriter\nTOFUNMI OLOKE\nTofunmi Oloke discusses her\nexperiences at Imperial.\nI hope to continue\ndown this path of\ngrowth and self-discovery\n\u201c\nImperial students know how to party!

Perfringens is a bacterial infection with similar symptoms except for the lack of vomiting and the earlier onset of symptoms \u2013 six to 24 hours\npost infection. Campylobacter is another\nbacterial infection that results more on\nbloody stool and stomach cramps and\ntakes longer to notice \u2013 two to five days.\nAll four illnesses are treatable at home\nwith lots of rest and fluids (tea, water) but\nnot coffee. Coffee is a diuretic (produces\nurine) which increases water excretion.\nLoose stool already drains a lot of liquid\nout of your body, hence drinking a lot of\nwater replenishes your body with the water you lose to the toilet bowl.\nHigh-risk foods\nAccording to the UK Food Standard\nAgency, any meat \u2013 turkey, chicken, duck,\npork,mincedmeat,beeforbird\u2013includes\na low risk of the bird flu (Avian Influenza)\nwhen not cooked properly. Some guidelines are to cook until you can no longer\nsee any pink meat. Unless trained, a rare\nbeef patty should not be cooked DIY.\nFurthermore, stuffing should be cooked\nseparately, as stuffed birds take longer to\ncook and may not cook thoroughly. Now,\nyou may ask yourself: Can I eat meat with\nbacteria on it? Generally, it is the responsibility of the consumer to cook the meat\nto kill all bacteria. Most bacteria come\nfrom the handlers (butcher, industrial\nworkers) and not the meat itself. The bacteria are often on the surfaces, hence cuts\nof meats can be considered safer than\nmixed meats (minced beef or sausages)\nsince the bacteria is purely on the sur-face. Problem solved. But what about the\nvegans and vegetarians?\nStill high-risk foods\nVegans and vegetarians abstain from\nmeat products and vegans do not consume any dairy (milk, cow milk yoghurt,\ncheese, cream etc.), honey, fish eggs, eggs\nor other animal produced foods, hence\nthe chances of them consuming any\nanimal-based bacteria are low. That is,\nif their vegetables are not farmed close\nto an animal farm, where the irrigation\nwater from faeces could contaminate\nthe water for the plants. As a vegan my-self, I started to cook my spinach rather\nthan eat it raw. Bacteria can transfer onto\nthe vegetables, grains or fruits during\ngrowth, harvest, packaging, transpor-tation, distribution, presentation in the\ngrocery store and even by the consumer\u00b4s own hands.\nFrozen\nA general money-saving hack is to buy\nproduce frozen. Frozen peas, for exam-ple, can be bought by the kilo for roughly\n\u00a33 to \u00a34 and stored for a long time. Frozen\nvegetables are amazingly cheap when\nused in soups or stews, as there is not a\nbig difference in nutritional value, but\nonly in texture. Frozen fruits are great\nfor smoothies, yoghurt bowls, protein\nshakes or for any other dish that focuses\non the fruit\u00b4s flavour and not shape, size\nor firmness. The catch with frozen food\nis the time. Frozen food keeps bacteria\n(mould) from growing \u2013 but that does\nnot mean that there are not present. Just\n\u2018asleep\u2019. Chemical reactions within the\nfrozen food are delayed, hence they do\nnot spoil \u2013 but once you reheat your food,\nthe little bacteria awake from their long\nwinter-nap and can become dangerous.\nDefrost slowly for a few hours \u2013 in a separate container in your fridge and not at\nroom temperature or in the microwave\nand cook within a few hours. With meat\nproducts, particularly fish, defrosting\nfast by placing the produce under hot water can start cooking the food, hence be\ncareful and instead wait a bit longer. Do\nyour calculus homework while you wait.\nEggs: fridge or cupboard?\nIn the US, for example, eggs need to be\nstored in the fridge. In the EU, they last\nwell in the pantry. In the UK, it is not so\nsimple. Every box must inform the consumer if the eggs need to be \u2018refrigerated\nor stored in a cool dry place\u2019 .\nRecalls\nIt is unusual to wander the supermarket,\nwhere an empty shelve stands still with a\nlittle A4 paper printed with the word \u2018Recall\u2019 printed on it. This means a product\nthat was there recently has been removed\nfor safety reasons. What sort of safety\nreasons? On 15th\nSeptember 2023, Morrisons \u2013 a chain supermarket in the UK\nrecalled its own Spanish Chorizo Rings\nbecause of salmonella. On 7th\nSeptember, Costa recalled some sandwiches and\nwrap products because some had small\nstones in them that could cause choking.\nTwo days before, on 5th\nSeptember, Lidl\nrecalled McEnnedy Corn Dogs because\nsome were found to have listeria monocytogenes in them, a bacterium responsible\nfor many food-poisoning-like symptoms.\nTwo weeks before, Avoca recalled their\nvegetable lasagne, fish pie, duck liver\npate, carrot coconut coriander soup and\nmore than 20 other items as they may\nhave contained pieces of metal in them.\nThe Food Alert page hosted by the Food\nStandard Agency reports something new\nevery week. Since Febuary 2021, this website has announced 170 recalls because of\nbacterium (Hepatitis A, Salmonella etc.)\nor small pieces (glass, metal, plastic etc.).\nIndustries make mistakes\nNow the question should not be: Is the\nfood in the UK safe? but rather: Do I, as\nconsumer, know if this food is safe for me?\nConsidering the vast demand for quickly\nand cost-effective produced food in our\nsociety, mistakes and errors can occur.\nThe best way to protect one\u00b4s stomach\nand gut is by learning about food safety,\nto avoid blindly following a label that has\nbeen printed more than a thousand time\nand to use our societies most unused\nsixth sense: our common sense.\nStay safe.\nInfographic to answer some common questions.

Students are moving towards\nsubjects which offer a well-paid and\nstable career, in a rapidly-changing job\nmarket.\nImperial\u2019s two undergraduate\ncomputer science degrees (Computing,\nand Joint Maths & Computing (JMC)),\nhave the highest ratio of applicants to\nplaces (20:1 and 22:1, according to 2022\ndata) of any undergraduate course at\nthe College.\nIn related news, Imperial\u2019s Business\nSchool this year launched its first-ever\nundergraduate degree course \u2013 the BSc\ninEconomics,FinanceandDataScience\n(see Felix #1827). Speaking shortly\nbefore the course\u2019s launch, Dr Pedro\nRosa Dias, its academic director, said\nthat the programme was developed to\naddress the need for a \u201cnew generation\nof graduates in economics and finance\nwho are able to use data science to\nguide businesses, public bodies, and\ninternational organisations in today\u2019s\ndigital economy.\u201d\nICUlaunches\nStudent\nExperienceFund\nI\nmperial College Union (ICU) has created\na fund to help students who would\notherwise be unable to afford it, to take\npart in the Union\u2019s activities and events.\nEligible students will receive a sum of\nmoney which can be spent on Clubs,\nSocieties & Project (CSP) memberships and\nevents, in addition to other Union events\nsuch as Summer Ball.\nAll students on an Imperial Bursary,\nwith an annual household income of less\nthan \u00a360,000, will automatically receive\nan allowance from the fund. The allowance\nwill be credited to their Union accounts,\nand can be spent on purchases from the\nUnion shop, with the exception of retail\nproducts such as merchandise.\nThose awarded the highest sum (\u00a365)\nwill receive enough to cover over 98% of\nCSP memberships.\nThe fund is the brainchild of Dylan\nHughes, 2022/23 Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies). Its announcement comes\nafter ICU\u2019s Clubs, Societies & Projects\nCulture Review last year, which set out\nlong-term goals to improve the culture and\nexperience of students at Imperial.\nOne of the goals put forward in that\nreview was to create a fund to give all\nstudents the opportunity to participate in\nhigh-cost activities.\nIn future years, the Union says it intends\nto refine the fund to include all those who\narelessabletopartakeinstudentactivities.\nImperial Computing\ngrads highest paid of any\nUK undergrad degree\nNews comes as\napplications\nfor computing-related\ndegrees surge\nnationwide.\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nSource: The Times and The Sunday Times Good\nUniversity Guide / Higher Education Statistics\nAgency\nSubject Salary\nComputer science \u00a364,000\nEEE \u00a342,000\nMathematics \u00a340,000\nChemical Engineering \u00a338,500\nMedicine \u00a336,000\nAeronautics \u00a335,000\nBioengineering and\nBiomedical Engineering\n\u00a335,000\nPhysics \u00a335,000\nMechanical\nEngineering\n\u00a333,500\nBiological sciences \u00a332,000\nCivil Engineering \u00a332,000\nMaterials \u00a331,000\nChemistry \u00a330,878\nGeology \u00a328,500\nHow does your degree\ncompare?\nMedian undergraduate salary six\nmonths after graduation\nAnnual household\nincome\nFunding per\nstudent\nUp to \u00a316,000 \u00a365\nUp to \u00a350.000 \u00a345\nUp to \u00a355,000 \u00a325\nUp to \u00a360,000 \u00a320\n\n"

Several cohorts have been\nawarded only provisional grades,\nalthough, of the 3,065 students\ngraduating this year, only 15 still await\nconfirmation of their final classification.\nThe MAB, which is classed as action\nshort of a strike, began on 17th\nMay and is\nexpected to continue until 18th\nOctober.\nOnly 55 of Imperial\u2019s 2,107 academic\nand teaching staff are participating in the\nMAB. The action was called in response\nto Imperial\u2019s local pay award. Since 2005,\nthe College has negotiated pay directly\nwith staff representatives from the local\nbranches of three trade unions: Imperial\nUCU, Imperial Unite, and Imperial\nUNISON, together known as the Joint\nTrade Unions (JTU).\nThe College has offered a median\nyear-on-year pay increase of 5.5%,\nup to a maximum of \u00a35,000. The JTU\nargue that this is a real-terms pay cut,\nand have instead asked for a pay rise of\n10.5%, in line with inflation. They say a\n10.5% increase would retain the value\nof Imperial\u2019s median pay since 2005, but\nImperial claims this is unaffordable.\nNegotiations have failed to produce\nan agreement. The College has offered a\none-off \u00a3500 cost-of-living payment in\nNovember, but says it will rescind it if the\nJTU reject its annual pay offer.\nBoycotting staff have been angered\nby the College\u2019s decision to deduct their\npay. Imperial is withholding 25% of pay\nfrom boycotting staff for the period of\ntheir participation in the MAB. Some\nstaff say they have been forced to stop\nparticipating in the industrial action, as\nthey are no longer able to cope with the\nfinancial implications.\nSome staff have reportedly been hit\nwith pay cuts of 125%, when strike days\nhave fallen during the MAB. When on\nstrike, staff are not paid at all.\nStaff have expressed their anger at\nImperial\u2019s response on social media.\n\u201cBullying and punitive pay deductions\nhaven\u2019t worked\u2026if Kings and UCL can\nmake progress on pay negotiations, why\ncan\u2019t Imperial?\u201d reads one well-received\nmessage on the College\u2019s internal Viva\nEngage platform.\nUCL agreed to a demand by its local\nUCU branch to increase its London\nweighting allowance to \u00a34,500 from\nAugust 2023, and Kings College is in\nnegotiations for a similar \u00a34,500 August\npay deal.\n\u201cThe renumeration packages for\nseveral of the institutions that Imperial\nwould regard as competitors have\nnow vastly improved the salary deals\nof their staff,\u201d explains Vijay Tymms,\nImperial UCU\u2019s branch president. \u201cEvery\nuniversity relies on the goodwill of its\nstaff\u2026if that\u2019s no longer there, then it\u2019s\ngoing to be very difficult for them to\nrecruit and retain the calibre of staff they\nwant at Imperial.\u201d\nStudents have mixed feelings towards\nthe MAB; those in the worst-affected\ndepartments in particular feel a sense\nof resentment and worry over the delays\nin receiving results and coursework\nNEWS\nImperial students face delays to\nprogression, grade confirmation,\nand exam results.\nNewsWriter\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nUCU members picketing outside Imperial on Monday 4th October.

If you ever look\nup a route on Citymapper and see that\nthe walk is just 10 or 15 minutes longer\nthan travelling by Tube or bus, why\nnot opt to go on foot instead? Ever so\nslightly cheaper, a good bit of exercise,\nand infinitely more scenic; I promise\nyou won\u2019t regret it.\nAlternatively, pick an area you want\nto explore and just wander through\nit. A few fascinating areas to visit\nthat are relatively near campus are\nChelsea, Hammersmith, Notting Hill,\nand Battersea Park and Power Station.\nYou\u2019re sure to stumble upon excellent\neateries, cosy caf\u00e9s, and splendid shops\nalong the way \u2013 London has loads\nto offer if you take the time to look\naround. The city will look especially\nlovely in the coming months, when\nwinter is on the way and Christmas\nlights start shining.\nHere are a couple of routes I\u2019ve done\nfrom Imperial\u2019s South Kensington\ncampus multiple times, and would\nrecommend. Northwest through Hyde\nPark to Notting Hill Gate, and up to\nNotting Hill and Portobello Road (Walk\nA), or due east along Knightsbridge\nRoad, through Green Park, past\nBuckingham Palace and St. James\u2019s\nPark, and all the way to Southbank\non the Thames (Walk B). These will\nlook like long walks, but, trust me, it\u2019s\nrefreshing (and warming) to get your\nbody moving.\nI\u2019ve had many an engaging and eye-opening conversation with a friend on\nthese walks; it\u2019s an incredible way to get\nto know someone quickly, and without\ndistraction. I implore you to give it a\ntry, and if you find anything exciting on\nyour journeys, let your fellow students\nknow by writing an article about it and\nsending it in to us!\nFOOD & TRAVEL\nCanvassing London\nwhile achieving\nyour 10,000 steps\nDeputyEditor\nZANNA BUCKLAND\nOur Deputy editor explains why you\nshould exchange dinner tables for\npavements, and wheels for sneakers\nGoogle Maps estimates Walk B to be 1h 20 minutes and 3.5 miles (5.6 km).

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n20 | MUSIC 6 October 2023\nR\nising to prominence in 2018 with\nmeme hit \u201cMOOO!\u201d, Doja Cat had\nbeen steadily making her way into\nmainstream media ever since. Her second album Hot Pink spawned hit singles\nsuch as \u201cSay So\u201d and \u201cStreets\u201d which\nwent viral on TikTok and catapulted her\nstatus into a household name. With the\nrelease of her third album Planet Her, she\nfirmly cemented herself as a big player in\nthe pop-rap and R&B space with characteristic candy-coated production, sweet,\nsmooth vocals, and quick-witted, lip-syn-cable flow.\nSo when Scarlet\u2019s lead single \u201cAttention\u201d dropped, she stirred both her\nfanbase and haters alike. The single\u2019s\nproduction grabs you straight away,\nwith arpeggiated harp riffs, 90s hiphop drums, and possibly my favourite\nbassline of the year; a sound I hadn\u2019t\nheardherexperimentwithbefore.Ontop\nof the track\u2019s distinct production, Doja\u2019s\nbars and flow also impressed, riding the\nbeat like a pro with fun rhythms, switching up her intonation between verses,\nand delivering clever lyrics \u2013 it kind of reminded me of J. Cole. It certainly turned\nheads and impressed many people who\nhad brushed her off as a serious rapper\npreviously and it was quite the departure\nfrom her usual pop-dominated sound.\nAside from \u201cPaint the Town Red\u201d\nwhich was quite reminiscent of Planet\nHer tracks, the other singles also teased\nthe new album\u2019s sound well. \u201cDemons\u201d\nshowcased a fast-paced, punchy sound\nfeaturing fragmented stabs of strange\nstring melodies, a gritty, shouty chorus,\nand verses which ranged from soft-spo-ken, almost childlike to very rhythmic\nand filled with attitude. I feel like Doja\u2019s confidence in her own rap skills has\ngrown as her career progressed, and we\ncan certainly hear it more through the\nway she\u2019s playing with her delivery. \u201cAgora Hills\u201d, the most recent single, is Doja\u2019s\nway of showing us she hasn\u2019t forgotten\npop entirely \u2013 mixing an atmospher-ic, ethereal production (think cruising\ndown the highway in California with the\ntop down and your boo in the passenger\nseat). With her signature buttery-smooth\nsinging voice, and an addictive valley\ngirl accent which scratches a spot in my\nbrain I didn\u2019t know existed, I have a feeling it will appear high up in my Spotify\nWrapped this year.\nAs a whole body though, I would say\nScarlet is not Doja Cat\u2019s most cohesive\nnor most exciting work. While I appreciate the need to prove herself to haters by\nputting out an album with no features,\nembracing her rap roots, and showcasing\nher versatility, it seemed like there was a\nlost connection between tracks and yet\nthey also sounded quite similar. I could\nsense the presence of fillers, and it also\nseemed like the album was split into two\nhalves; if this was purposeful it was not\nclear and it just felt like she switched projects halfway through.\nAs for her proving that she\u2019s capable of\nmore than TikTok-worthy bars, there\u2019s a\nsmattering of good lines such as, \u201clost a\nlil\u2019 weight but I ain\u2019t never lost the tushy,\nlooking good but now my bald head\nmatch my...\u201d and \u201csince when was y\u2019all\nmy bastard children, go \u2018head and raise\ny\u2019all self\u201d paying homage to Nicki Minaj\u2019s signature, recurring line \u201call these\nbitches is my sons\u201d. But overall, Doja\nCat\u2019s wordplay, double and triple-enten-dre, and extended metaphor abilities fall\nshort of the greats. Each line is quite on\nthe nose and whilst I appreciate not having to work too hard to get it, give your\naudience some credit, Doja. My favourite tracks which show off her rap skills\nwould probably be \u201cFuck The Girls (FTG)\u201d\nand \u201cOuchies\u201d for the flow and delivery\nand \u201cGo Off\u201d, an homage to a confident,\nindependent girlfriend, for a song with\nlyrics that flow and really tell a story.\nConceptually, the album is right where\nI like it. Maybe I\u2019m still an edgy teen at\nheartbutI\u2019malwaysafanofartistsreleasing albums amidst a period of public controversy (think Taylor Swift\u2019s Reputation);\nDoja\u2019s recent online beef with superfans,\npeople scrutinising her ever- changing\naesthetics, and critics of her rap abilities\nwas apparent in the album. I love it when\nartists clap-back!\nOverall, this is a good album and I enjoyed listening to it. There were certainly\nsome moments where I was a little bored,\nperhaps the order of the tracks placed\nsongs that were too similar next to each\nother, and lyrically I was left a little un-derwhelmed, sonically though I was very\nglad to hear a different facet of Doja Cat\nand get to experience a darker, more nuanced side to her personality through her\nmusic. I look forward to seeing where she\nwill go next.\nKeep up with writer Amanda Paul via her\nInstagram @amanda_p.x\nD, I\u2019m really shooketh\nMusicWriter\nAMANDA PAUL\nDoja Cat departs\nfrom her usual\nbubblegum pop-rap sound to give\nus Scarlet.\nAlbum cover for Scarlet.

However, art can also serve functions from time to time; it can shape our\nunderstanding of society, history, and, as\nyou shall soon find out, science!\nScience and art have been intertwined\nfor millennia: after all, the rendering of\na faithful diagram, schematic, or naturalist depiction requires a certain amount\nof artistic skill. However, when your\napparatus or faunal subject matter is\nright in front of you, you are safe in the\nknowledge that you will know whether\nor not your artistic rendition is faithful.\nIf your subject matter happens to have\nbeen dead for millions of years, and you\nhave little to go on but bone fragments\nand rock impressions, you are left with\nthe daunting task of trying to depict truly\nunimaginable creatures.\nThis was the task set for the artists of\nthe 18th\nand 19th\ncenturies when the subject of palaeontology began to take flight;\nthe understanding that these mysterious\nbones found in caves and holes were in\nfact the remains of creatures from a lost\nworld. However, it was not a task that\nhadn\u2019t been accomplished before; many\nscholars believe that depictions of mythical creatures like dragons, cyclopes, and\nhydrae were in fact based on the remains\nof extinct animals excavated from mines\nand quarries in the ancient era. However, this time, the Victorian artists could\nnot let their imaginations run wild like\nthe ancient Greeks did. With more complete skeletons being excavated, the depictions had to actually be faithful to the\nsource material.\nHenry De la Beche became the first\nartist to portray the lost world with a \u2018A\nMore Ancient Dorset\u2019 which features\ndepictions of Plesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs based on remains found by palae-ontological pioneer Mary Anning. The\nart shows that these animals were very\nmuch aquatic lizards (although the idea\nof them frolicking alongside modern turtles and other such aquatic creatures is\nabsurd).\nAnother example that came along was\nby famous landscape artist John Martin,\nwho created the \u2018Country of the Iguanodon\u2019 which depicts titanic, dragon-like\nlizards battling it out in a hellish landscape (of course, hellish landscapes were\nMartin\u2019s speciality). This would later\nbecome inspiration for \u2018The Iguanodon\nPair\u2019, two sculptures of an Iguanodon exhibited at the Crystal Palace, which can\nbe found today at Crystal Palace Park. Of\ncourse, in both the landscape painting\nand the sculptures, significant liberties\nare taken. A recurring theme of Victorian depictions was that the Mesozoic\nera was an apocalyptic world with monstrous lizards fighting on the regular. Of\ncourse, our better understanding of bone\nstructures allows us to now know what\nan Iguanodon really looks like and so today we can look at these paintings with\nhumour about how 19th\n-century subconscious belief was likely fuelled by protestant ethics and the idea that the lost\nworld was truly Godless and nightmar-ish.\nFor a while, these depictions became\netched in the minds of the youth and the\nacademic.

Written by Rachel Carson \u2013 a marine biologist who\ngraduated from the Pennsylvania College of Women and\nJohns Hopkins University \u2013 the book explains the impacts of widespread synthetic herbicides and pesticides\non humans and ecosystems. She also discusses the reasoning for their continued use at the time and the lack\nof regulation despite recommendations from the scientific community.\nDuring the late 1950s, the United States government\nemployed the insecticide DDT in eradication programs\nfor pests like fire ants and mosquitos. This inadvertently\nled to the deaths of countless wildlife \u2013 particularly birds\n\u2013 as well as mass crop damage; events which were the\nprimary inspiration for Silent Spring. What shocked me\nmost when reading this book wasn\u2019t simply learning of\nsuch horrific incidents, but how little I had heard about\nthem before and how difficult they were to fact-check.\nOne would expect an ecological tragedy of this severity\nto be as well-known as the sinking of the Titanic \u2013 but\nask a random person on the street about them both, and\nthey will almost certainly only know about one.\nThe message of Silent Spring still rings starkly true;\nnot only with toxic chemicals, but also in the case of mi-croplastic distribution. Carson\u2019s discussion of the accumulation of pesticides in living cells and tissues eerily\nresembles the pervasiveness of microplastics in organisms and ecosystems.\nThe knowledge that my bloodstream is presently\nfilled with a myriad of miniscule toxic particles makes\nmy skin crawl more than any fictional horror tale could.\nAnd yet it\u2019s not front-page news, I wasn\u2019t taught it in\nschool, and I didn\u2019t find it out from anyone I know. If\neven the most educated among us are potentially unaware of such things, how can we hope to thoroughly enact positive change?\nLarge-scale conservation efforts are the responsibility of governments and corporations, but the average\ncitizen needs to stay informed and engaged to keep\nthose entities accountable. We all need to be aware of\nwhat\u2019s going on in academic research, what significant\nenvironmental events are transpiring around the world,\nand what governing bodies are and aren\u2019t doing about\nthem. This is why effective education and journalism\nare crucial \u2013 without reliable journalism, all advocacy is\nrendered pointless.\nalso involved in the formation of the principles. The\n[traction has been positive] overall, but the principles are still in the works.\u201d\nOn sustainability initiatives at\nImperial\nWhen asked which sustainability initiatives at Imperial she\u2019d like to highlight, Stephanie points us\ntowards the series of environment-related societies\nand campaigns at Imperial. In particular, she highlights Imperial Climate Action, saying: \u201cThey\u2019ve\nbeen very active in terms of lobbying for change.\nThey have been and continue to stay involved with\nus, and I think their voice has been seen. Having\nthat collective voice there helps the College see that\nchange is needed. It gives us the ammunition to demand change from the College.\u201d\nA monthly sustainability forum is also in the works.\n\u201cThe forum will be a place for students to share their\nthoughts, no matter how small\u201d, Stephanie reveals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for me to have a direct channel with anyone\nwho\u2019s interested. For each forum I\u2019m hoping to set up\na theme so that there\u2019s a central topic to talk about.\nFor the first one in October, I\u2019m hoping to focus on\nthe Union\u2019s plans, how students can get involved,\nand to get student feedback on these initial plans.\u201d\nFuture forums will be centered around COP28, the\nimpact of climate change on health, climate anxiety,\nand more.\nOn her favourite animal\n\u201cI love elephants\u201d, she smiles. \u201cI have a picture of me\nand all my elephant soft toys \u2013 there\u2019s at least 16 of\nthem. I love them, and one in particular is very tat-tered. [Elephants are] such cute, benevolent creatures.\u201d\nEnvironmental education and\nreliable journalism are crucial\nDeputyEditor\nZANNA BUCKLAND\nIn a press conference on Wednesday 20th\nSeptember, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak explained\nthat target dates for several net-zero pledges are\nto be shifted forward (e.g., implementation of\na ban on new petrol or diesel cars moving from\n2030 to 2035). This comes after his approval of\nnew Rosebank oilfield as well as exposure of his\nfamily\u2019s ties to fossil-fuel company Shell. Sunak\ninsists the UK is still on track to meet its original\ntarget of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by\n2050, despite original commitments being tentatively on track at best.\nIf you have a stance on my column, or regarding\nthe UK\u2019s revised climate-action plan, I invite you to\ncontribute to the discussion right here in the Environment section.\nPoster for Environment & Sustainability Forum (at the Union\nBuilding in Beit Quad).

This was what Stephanie had to say:\nOn why sustainability matters to her\nStephanie attributes her enthusiasm for sustainability\nto a science project she conducted when she was eight,\nwhere she first learned about global warming. \u201cIt started with household habits like turning off the lights\u201d,\nshe described, \u201cand making sure we\u2019re not [producing]\nwaste where we don\u2019t need to.\u201d In her school years, she\njoined a competition and pitched for a \u201cgroup that focused on beach cleanups and advocating for general\nplastic waste awareness\u201d \u2013 which went on to receive\nsome seed funding. At her second year at Imperial, she\nwas the Ethics and Environment Officer, and despite\nthis experience being during COVID-19 times, she says\nit has \u201chelped inform a lot of the things [she does] now\nwith regards to sustainability.\u201d\nOn the use of disposable plastic cups in\nthe Union bars\nStephanie sees the use of disposable plastic cups in the\nUnion bars as one of the most unsustainable practices at\nthe Union. She explains that the Union uses plastic because \u201cpeople get drunk and become more clumsy, and\nwe don\u2019t want glass shattering \u2013 it\u2019s a health and safety\nrisk.\u201d However, she has been \u201clooking into options and\ncontinuing discussions with the venues team to see\nwhether we can transition into reusable options \u2013 even\nif it\u2019s still plastic.\u201d\nOn incentivising sustainable modes of\ntransport\nStephanie highlights using trip policies to encourage\nmore sustainable modes of transport. \u201cLet\u2019s say a society\nwants to go abroad to somewhere in France. Rather than\nflying, they can take the train,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if the Eurostar costs more, we would be willing to fund you to\ntake the train. We want to make sure societies have the\noption to choose the more sustainable means of transportation where possible. We want to give incentives for\nCSPs and [give grants accordingly], [which would] make\nCSPs rethink the way they operate \u2013 I think a lot of it is a\nculture change.\u201c\nOn going digital\nThe union is going digital where they can. \u201cThis is one\nof the biggest moves we\u2019ve made in marketing,\u201d she ex-plains. Rather than giving out stacks of flyers, we\u2019re trying to minimise this into QR codes so that people can\naccess information on our website.\u201d\nOn CSP sponsorships\nLast year, Felix published an article revealing the vast\nsums of money fossil fuel companies give Imperial CSPs\n(Issue 1814). When asked about this, Stephanie com-mented: \u201dUnfortunately money is situated with those\nin power and a lot of [these companies] tend to not be\nas ethical or as environmentally friendly as they should\nbe...namely [the fossil fuel giants] like Shell and Chevron\u201d. On the first of August, Imperial\u2019s board of trustees\npassed a new policy on the \u2018Principles of Socially Responsible Engagement\u2019. The aim of these principles is to\nensure that any third-party relationships are consistent\nwith the Union\u2019s mission and values. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying\nto move us into the direction such that we are only partnering with ethical and environmentally-friendly corporations and businesses. We put a lot of money into\nour CSPs and we want to make sure that money goes to\ngood places. [These principles were] passed very recent-ly, so we are navigating how we\u2019re going to encourage\nour CSPs to move away from these partnerships. If any\nsociety wants to [partner with these kinds of compa-nies], there will be a more thorough [questioning pro-cess]: How does this benefit your members? How does it\nbenefit the students? How does that outweigh [the negative environmental effects]? Ultimately, as a union, we\nwant to ensure student benefit. There are some societies\n\u2013 such as Chemical Engineering and Materials \u2013 that will\nbe linked by nature [to these types of companies]. But\nthey are also very open to this discussion \u2013 they were\nImperial College\nUnion\u2019s DPFS on her\nsustainability ideals.\nENVIRONMENT\nStephanie Yeung.
