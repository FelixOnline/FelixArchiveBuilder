The previous occupant of the Villas has been relocated to Bexhillon-sea by the College as part of a planning deal with the local borough\ncouncil.\nOne consequence of the method of deconstruction is the opportunity\nfor souvenirs from the building. Always with an eye on saving pennies,\nIan Caldwell, College's Director of Estates, has suggested that some form\nof fixtures and fittings auction could take place with proceeds going\ntoward the new boat house. \"Perhaps old-boys would like to buy-a brick\"\nhe commented.\nDraconian College\ndiscipline applied\nMARIA IOANNOU\nAn Imperial College student faced\nthe firing squad at a disciplinary\nhearing recently, charged with hurling a full can of beer from the top of\nSouthside and through the window\nof a local resident (Felix 1065). The\noffender, a PhD student, was\ndescribed as \"naturally upset\" by his\nactions, having been invited into\nTizard Hall as a guest during\nFreshers' Week.\nThe wrongdoer was sentenced to\nthe IC equivalent of three years hard\nlabour, as the incident was taken\n\"very seriously\" by the College.\nChairman of the Disciplinary\nCommittee, Professor Rhys\nRawlings, adopted a fair-minded\napproach; \"We had no punitive wish\nto ruin his student career for what\nwas an foolish and isolated incident.\"\nThe student suffered three penal-ties, namely a suspension from all\nCollege premises for two months,\nexclusion from all College social\nfacilities, ie all bars, refectories and\nthe sports centre for the remainder of\nhis time as a student. The third penalty metered was financial, the student\nbeing required to reimburse the resident for the replacement of the glass\nand to give the equivalent to a Union\ncharity (though a maximum limit of\n\u00a3300 has been agreed).\nWhen questioned, the \"upset and\nfrightened\" householder, who by\ncoincidence is a member of the\nKnightsbridge Local Residents\nAssociation, said \"...it's past and\ngone\" and would make no further\ncomment on the matter.\nThe student is unlikely to appeal\nas there is little question of either his\nguilt or the circumstances surrounding the incident.\nUNIVERSITY CHALLENGE This year's Imperial College\nUniversity Challenge team suffered\ndefeat with the very last question of\nTuesday's first round clash with St\nCatherine's College, Cambridge.\nAfter a poor start, Imperial College\nquickly caught up, and went on to\nput up a good fight on the BBC2 student quiz show.\nWhen the gong eventually sound-ed, both teams finished up with 200\npoints. The Imperial team, captained\nby Ian Bayley, lost the unprecedented tie-break question, which was\nswiftly answered by St Catherine's. While Jeremy Paxman's former\nCollege qualify for the second round,\nthe IC team will have to wait and see\nwhether they progress as one of the\nfirst round's highest scoring losers.\nNO SWEAT FUNDING\nConcerns over the failure of Imperial\nCollege to capital is e on their specialist areas (Felix 1068) have been\nrefuted by senior College sources.\nSpeaking to Felix, Professor Bill\nWakeham, Pro-Rector of Research,\nsought to clarify IC's position on\nincome from research. Under the\nclassifications used by HEFCE and\npolling companies, IC carries out little 'applied research' but conducts\nmuch basic and strategic research\nfunded by the national research\ncouncils that brings in considerable\nincome. Studies, such as that published in the Times Higher\nEducational Supplement and quoted\nby Felix show that Cranfield\nUniversity tops the league for\nresearch income. Professor\nWakeham contends that this is due to\nCranfield's reliance on applied\nresearch and industrial earnings and\nnot income from research councils.\nMoving on to the income received\nfrom intellectual property rights, he\nagain highlighted the commercial\nvalue of the researches involved -Institutions which had a large\nincome from this source had almost\nalways got one single large earning\ninvention, rather than a wide range of\nmodest earning items. Although the\nearning from this source at IC has\nfluctuated greatly from year to year,\nProfessor Wakeman stressed that it\nwas on an upward trend, and the\nCollege was still hopeful of the big\nwinner.\nBARMAN INJURED\nGerald Monohoe, Senior Bar\nSteward at IC Union, was taken to\ncasualty last Sunday after injuring\nhis back whilst attempting to pull a pint. Though one of the two Union\nmembers of staff trained in Health\nand Safety, Gerry failed to notice\nthat the pump had not refilled. This\nmeant there was an unexpected lack\nof resistance when he pulled and he\nended up on the floor.\nGerald will be back at work on\nFriday and pulling more than ever.\nMORE FIRE ALARMS On Friday afternoon the Blackett\nLaboratory was rapidly evacuated\nafter fire alarms sounded. College\nSecurity once again demonstrated\ntheir efficiency by ordering all students to cross Prince Consort Road.\nThe alarm had been raised when a group of 3rd and 4th year Physics\nstudents entering Lecture Theatre 2\nfound it filled with a \"very thin\nsmoke.\" That session's lecturer,\nProfessor A McKinnon, arrived on\nthe scene and became so distressed\nthat it was necessary for a nearby,\nquick-thinking student to advise the\nsetting off of the alarm. There was in\nreality no need to panic as the\n\"smoke\" turned out to be steam\nreleased by the ventilation system.\nSCANDAL AT GUYS AND ST THOMAS' S Playing rugby against Guys and St\nThomas's medical school will be\nconsiderably easier for the next six\nmonths after most of the squad were\nbarred from playing after a particularly gruesome tour incident.\nWhilst staying in a hotel in\nPortsmouth during a tour, a morning-after drinking party was in full swing\nwhen somebody suggested Bloody\nMary's. This in itself is not that\nunusual, but these medics, being\nresourceful people, had brought their\nintravenous eq up i ment with them,\ntook the suggestion literally and an\norgy of bloodletting and drinking\nensued. Back at home, nothing was\nsaid until hacks at The Sun got wind\nof the story and exposed the medical\nstudents to the full glare of publicity.\nThe least of the punishments doled\nout by the now irate Dean was a six\nmonth ban on rugby, and many of\nthe medics got severe reprimands.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER LETTERS 11\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nreplied to this week by David Roberts\nA new perspective on\nClayponds spending\nDear Editor,\nI would like to reply to a number of\npoints made by Andrew Payne in his\nletter last week. His general complaint was that the management had\ngot its priorities wrong in spending\n\u00a3160,000 on new carpets when the\nmoney would have been better spent\non security. The point has been made\nby Daniels on a number of occasions\nthat many of the carpets at\nClayponds had become so damaged\nthat they presented a significant safety hazard, particularly on the stair-ways. They clearly needed changing\nurgently. On the other hand, many of\nthe carpets in the study bedrooms\nwere in surprisingly good condition.\nIt is possible that a significant\namount of money could have been\nsaved if a comprehensive survey had\nbeen carried out, leaving some of the\ncarpets to give a few years more ser-vice. This money could then have\nbeen ploughed into security\nupgrades.\nI do however, take issue with\nAndrew's conclusion that the most\nurgent upgrade is in the form of front\ndoor locks. There were 12 burglaries\nat Clayponds in the three month period July-September this year. Of\nthese only one was through a front\ndoor with the kind of lock Andrew\nmentions (in fact, the only burglary\never at Clayponds in which entry was\nthrough a front door). In that case the\nglass panel of the door was broken,\nwhich is very unusual. Of the others,\nin one case entry was through a back\ndoor which had altogether four locks\non it (the flat had been burgled\nbefore and extra measures had been\ntaken) and for all of the rest entry\nwas through windows. I agree that\nthe front door locks are, in principle,\ninadequate but in practice they are\nsimply not our major problem.\nAndrew suggested that money set\naside for our proposed common\nroom would more appropriately be\nspent on security upgrades. It is clear\nto me that Andrew's views are out of\nline with those of the vast majority of\npast and present residents. This has\nbeen made abundantly clear to me\nduring my five years as Warden at\nClayponds. By a mile, the single\nmost frequently voiced complaint\nabout Clayponds is its lack of communal facilities. When the College\nwas seeking planning permission for\nthe 'village hall' project last year\nsome of the residents organised a petition in favour of the village hall.\nAbout half of the residents signed\nthis petition. This represented all but\ntwo of the people who were asked. It\nwould seem that Andrew was either\none of these two or was not at home\nat the times that the petitioners\ncalled. The other possible explanation is that he agreed with the project\nat the time but has since changed his\nmind. If any other Clayponds residents support Andrew's view I would very much like to hear from\nthem. One of our major problems\nwith security derives from the lack of\ncommunity spirit a Clayponds. I am\nsure that a village hall would help\ngreatly in promoting such a spirit.\nDanny Segal,\nWarden, Clayponds\nWilson House wardens an\nendangered species\nDear Felix,\nI have heard tonight that some\nrumours regarding the Wardens and\ntheir lack of impartiality have been\ncirculated to you about allocations of\nstudent rooms at Wilson House.\nThese allegations are untrue. The\nWardens had to do the allocations for\nWilson House due to the lack of\nunderstanding of the special circumstances of Willy House by the IC\nadministration. The Wardens, especially the Assistant Warden at Willy\nHouse, are extremely upset about the\nlack of support from the students on\nthis matter.\nAs both Wardens are only motivated by the welfare of students, having no remuneration for the\nWardenship over and above free\naccommodation, they are at the point\nwhere, if this non-cooperation con-tin u es, they will cease to mediate\nbetween Mary's and IC in respect of\nstudent accommodation and will\nabrogate this task. The response of\nIC to this is likely to be to put professional managers in to do the job of\nthe Wardens and if any students\nthink that managers will have the\nbest interests of the students in mind\nin their deliberations they are seriously naive. The Wardens have bent\nover backwards to try to accommodate the wishes of students, in the\ncase of accommodation spending\nmany unpaid hours of work to get it\nright, and to have unfounded criticism directed against them is deeply\noffensive. If the Wardens of Willy\nHouse leave, as is likely in the present climate, then the students will\nhave to deal with the beau roc racy of\nIC directly. The Wardens have a direct line to the Pro-Rector and the\nDean of Mary's and still have problems fighting the battles on behalf of\nthe students - the students have no\nsuch links. I do not therefore see IC\nadmin v students as an equal contest.\nDo you?\nYours sincerely,\nA mole in the Wardens camp\nUnions call the whole\nthing off\nDear Felix,\nOver the last few weeks, staff in all\neight trade unions represented in UK\nuniversities have been voting on the\ncurrent pay dispute. We've just\nreceived the results, and we thought\nit was important to let students know\nas soon as possible that all eight\nunions have voted \"yes\" to industrial\naction.\nIt has been more than ten years\nsince lecturers at this College have\ngone on strike. We have been driven\nto it this time because the UCEA, the\nbody that negotiates with us on our\nemployer's behalf, has withdrawn\nfrom all discussions.\nThey won't talk about changing\ntheir current offer of 1.5%, or even\nsetting up a pay review body; a maz ingly, they've even refused to discuss - not even to implement, merely\nto discuss - some minor technical\nchanges to pay scales we've pro-posed. Other unions have had similar\nexperiences.\nFaced with this aggressive\napproach we've had no alternative\nbut to take action. Our aim is simply\nto get the employers' representatives\nround the table once more, or at least\nto get the case to arbitration.\nThe first effect of all this is that\nthere will be a one-day strike on 19\nNovember in which all the staff\nunions, both academic and ancillary,\nwill be taking part. We expect a virtual closure of the College except for\nessential and emergency services.\nWe will be asking the College to\ndonate any deducted staff pay to the\nStudent Hardship Fund.\nWe hope that this will be enough\nto get us talking again. But if it isn't, the next phase will consist of a boycott of College bureaucracy. We've\ntaken great pains to minimise the\nharm to students from our action, and\nwe think we've achieved that with\nour current plans. If you have any\nquestions or worries at all, however,\nplease don't hesitate to get in touch:\nwe're in the College phone book.\nPhil Ramsden,\nImperial College Association of\nUniversity Teachers\nSo, the decision would appear to\nhave been made - and despite\nevery effort from the unions, and\nvirtually no effort from the\nGovernment, the strike seems to be\ngoing ahead. Sad to relate, the continued decline in university funding has had just one up-side - it's earn t us an extra day in bed next\nTuesday, and the prospect of many\nmore to come.\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions\nare not necessarily those\nof the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1070\nis Monday 18th November.\nPlease bring some form of identification.

The ideal was that it was\nto be seen as a peace movement,\noperating on a national basis, for students who believed in a better future.\nIn other words, according to the NUS\npress office, \"a forum for nice ideas\n... it is still a fairly intimate organisation *\n\u2022 any idea that a student has may\nend up as a whole campaign.\"\nImperial dropped out in 1977 when it\nbecame dissatisfied with the\narrangement it had, which was a case of give but no take. It was felt\nthat the affiliation fee, now\n\u00a340,000 per annum, could be better used by channelling it directly\ninto ICU. The NUS's mission is to\nrepresent students, locally, nationally and internationally, to promote the\nviews of students on the education\nsystem, promote the interests of students on economic, social and youth\nissues which\nhave a direct\neffect on the\nstatus and welfare of students, promote and assist the improvement of\nStudent Unions and inform and train\nStudent union officers. However\nmany students don't really believe\nthat they are being represented, the\nonly real contact that they have with\nthe organisation is during Freshers'\nweek and through their NUS cards\nwhich offer 10% discount in many\ninstitutions. What many students\ndon't realise is that the majority of\nthese establishments will accept any\nUnion card.

During his career he\nworked alongside many historical figures, including Prime Ministers Atlee, Churchill, Eden,\nMacmillan and US Presidents Truman and\nEisenhower.\nMore widely known as Sir Roger Mellor\nMakins, Lord Sherfield was born in 1904. His\nfather a Brigadier-General and Conservative MP,\nowned a Victorian mansion house on Queens Gate,\nwhere the young Roger Makins spent his child-hood. The house was later demolished to make\nway for the expansion of the College. He went on\nto study at Winchester and Christchurch Colleges,\nOxford, where he later became a Fellow of All\nSouls in 1925.\nIn 1928, Makins joined the Foreign Office, with\nhis first overseas assignment coming just three\nyears later when he was appointed Third Secretary\nin Washington. Makins rose quickly through the\nranks, excelling in a number of positions including\ntime as Administrator of British Affairs in Oslo\nand the prestigious post of British Advisor to the\nLeague of Nations. In 1939, he ran the western arm\nof the Foreign Office before joining the staff of the\nMinister to West Africa in 1942. During the\nSecond World War, Makins headed up\nMacmillan's \"Mediterranean Allied Force\nHeadquarters\" in Algiers.\nAfter the war, the future Lord Sherfield returned\nto the States, this time as Economic Minister in\nWashington, but left within a year to pursue a scientific career. In 1946, he became Under Secretary\nin charge of North American Political and\nEconomic Developments. This involved liaising\nbetween the British and United States\nGovernments during the highly confidential early\ndevelopment of the_ atomic bomb (then known as\n'tube alloys'), preventing a breakdown in communication. In 1953, Makins returned to the USA for a third\ntime, as British Ambassador to Washington. A personal friend of President Eisenhower, his arrival in\nthe US was well-received and he proceeded to consolidate the good relations he had previously established. On his return to Britain, he become Joint\nPermanent Secretary to the Treasury, a post where\nhe found himself out of the public eye.\nBetween 1960 and 1964 he returned to a sci-en ce based position becoming Chairman of the\nAtomic Energy Authority. This and other later scientific achievements led to his nomination to The\nRoyal Society. During this time he forged a formal\nlink with IC, taking on the position of Head of the\nBoard of Governors.\nMakins retired from official duties in 1964 but\nwas far from the end of his career. It was in this\nyear that he was given his hereditary peerage,\nbecoming Baron Sherfield.\nHe took up the position of Chairman of the\nIndustrial and Commercial Finance Corporation,\nfollowed in 1966 by his Chairmanship of a major\nmerchant bank. Lord Sherfield became a Fellow\nand Warden of Winchester College, Oxford, and\nbetween 1990 and 1982 was Chancellor of Rading\nUniversity. He reaffirmed his commitment to science in 1987, by setting up a Select Committee in\nthe House of Lords for Science and Technology.\nHis impact on IC is still visible today. The\nSherfield Building (formerly the College Block)\nwas renamed in his honour in 1975. Bryan Lloyd\nDavis, Deputy College Secretary during Makins'\ntime remembers Lord Sherfield \".. .he was a very\ngood Chairman and a man of considerable presence, physically and mentally. The College benefited greatly from his leadership.\"\nOn his departure from Imperial College in 1974\nit was said of him \"no-one who dealt with him here\nwould imagine that he had any greater concern\nthan the College. His energy and enthusiasm is\nunlimited and he has never grudged time of trou-ble.\"\nRoger Mellor Makins, diplomat: born 3rd February 1904; Fellow All Souls, Oxford 1925-39\nCMG 1944, KCMG 1949, GCMG 1955, KCB\n1953, GCB 1960.

Died 9th November.\n\"Top Flight\" engineering bursa ries cut\nJACKIE S KEA TE The Government is yet again causing\ndistress to Universities across the\ncountry, after making the decision to\ncut the \"top flight\" engineering bur-s aries for promising students. As\nfrom 1997 high-ache i ving students\nwill not receive the \u00a3500 awards,\nwhich are viewed by many in the\nengineering world as essential incentives in a climate where recruitment\nto engineering is proving increasingly difficult.\nThe view shared by many is that\nfor the scheme to have any real\nimpact it would have had to be operated for several more years. Robin\nBond of the Engineering Council\nexpressed his disgust at the the\nGovernment pulling out, \"It is contrary to what is in the best interests of\nthe country. The scheme suceeded in\nwooing bright young people away\nfrom more fashionable subjects such\nas communication studies and leisure\nand tourism whose contribution to\nwealth creation is dubious.\"\nAt Imperial College, about 900\nstudents, from all areas of engineer-ing, receive the extra funding from\nthe Engineering Council on the basis\nof their A Level results - the requirement is two grade As and one grade\nB. Lorna Richardson, Assistant\nRegistrar, was keen to stress that\nthose students already receiving\nthese bursa ries will be unaffected,\nand that only students hoping for an\naward from 1997 onwards will be\ndisappointed.\nThe Government's withdrawal of\nthe funding is in line with their original policy to implement the bursar y for only three years.\n\n"

    "content": "12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 1 5TH NOVEMBER\nCynicism is one of those twentieth\ncentury social diseases that has pervaded almost every walk of life, so it\nwas refreshing to see the letter from\nLinda Hart in Felix that followed up\non her earlier gripes about sandwich-es. She reported that John Foster, the\nHead of Catering, had reassured her\nthat everything was all right and the\nsandwiches aren't really a rip-off.\nWell, that's OK then isn't it. Oh\ndeary, deary me. Dr Hart, you've\nbeen sold a dummy. Given the classic 'don't you worry, it's all right.\nUncle John knows best' line. Of\ncourse, you must realise this, but are\ntoo polite to 'analyse' his response.\nThat's where I 'll pick up the story.\nJohn Foster, who, it must be said\nwas most generous in offering a personal response to the letter, is, I fear,\nliving on a different planet.\nHowever, Linda, you are wrong to\nsuggest that QT sandwiches are on\naverage 15% more expensive than\nsurrounding outlets. They are, to use\nyour figure, 32.5% more expensive.\nThree little letters -V.A.T. We don't charge\nit, they do. Therefore,\nCollege Catering should\nautomatically have an\ninbuilt 17.5% price\nadvantage. The notion\nthat the Sandwich Shop\non Gloucester Rd has\nlower overheads is\nlaughable. How do you\nthink that making the\nsandwiches on site can\nbe cheaper than con\nSimon Baker\nloss of over \u00a3100,000, a pathetic performance flattered by strong results\nfrom Southside Bar (naturally) and\nSouthside Shop (on\ngrounds of failure). I am sure that you are a more effective manager\nthan your reply suggests, but your department is failing badly.\nAs I have said countless times before, you\nshould be able to\nundercut a small shop\nin a high rent area of\nLondon. Should you\nwish to discuss this\ntr acting out the work to a Voice Of Reason with me, as you did\nlarger firm? If you are with Linda, then may I right, then the whole direction of post suggest a lunchtime chat at the single\nwar economic theory appears to be\nmisguided. 'Any trading surplus is\nreinvested'. Correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut the last figures that I saw for the\nnet profitability of Catering showed a jewel in your crown, Southside Bar.\nBest beer in London, nay Britain, at\nsome of the lowest prices. If they can\nmanage it with pints, why can't the\nsame be done with sandwiches?\nI recently heard about something\ncalled 'The Spice Girls.' Sellers of\ncondiments, I thought, but apparent-ly, these charming young ladies have\nformed a beat combo that recently\nreached the top of the hit parade. It\nwas thus with some relish that I read\nVik's excellent review of the said\nartistes album last week. But hark!\nWhat lyrics did I see but 'God help\nthe mister that comes between me\nand my sister.' Having my finger on\nthe musical pulse, I immediately\nrecognised these lyrics as originating\nfrom The Beverly Sisters hit;\n'Sisters', which (much) older readers\nmay care to verify. We at Felix aim\nto be distinctive. Where else do you\nget a Thatcherite, techno loving, real\nale connoisseur with a working\nknowledge of the Beverly Sisters\ncreations. I tell you, lady, there'll\nnever be another one.\nin the course of duty Well, well, well. It seems that the\nso-called 'Russell Group' is in the\nnews again. For those of you who\ndon't know, this is a collection of\npowerful individuals from some of\nthe greater academic institutions of\nthis country; Cambridge, Oxford and\nImperial among them. Their touted\naim is to create a 'superleague' of the\nbest universities and colleges in the\ncountry, to claim the best students\nand the greatest funding for their\nresearch. For some reason many\npeople are completely up in arms\nabout this idea; but to me it seems a very sensible, even vital move. The\nfact is that this country needs a superleague, and needs it badly.\nIn recent years the concept of university education has changed. It is\nno longer 'education' as such, but\nmerely a complicated way of allowing people to find better jobs, without having to prove themselves in\nany real way. As employers demand\ndegree level staff, youngsters have to\nhave a degree regardless of its relevance or importance; and so universities nowadays cater almost solely\nto this need. With the increase of\nstudent numbers and the conversion\nof worthy polytechnics into second\nrate universities, the situation has\ngone from bad to plainly farcical.\nEverybody needs a degree, so everybody must have one. Thus, universities must cater to the lowest common\ndenominator in order to survive.\nThus, those who really do want to\nlearn, who really do want an e duca tion, are left stranded and without a hope.\nThis is why the superleague is\nnecessary. It will not attempt to\nreverse the trend, but will go with it.\nThose universities who are there to\nprovide qualifications can carry on\nwith their task, and hopefully allow\ntheir courses to cater more directly to\nworkplace training (since most\ndegree educated people don't know\nan in-tray from an out-tray, a desk\nfrom a filing cabinet). Meanwhile\nthe superleague can concentrate on\nthe serious task of learning; providing facilities for those who are not\nsuited to the job market, who wish to\ngo into research, or who merely want\nto gain a higher understanding of the\nworkings of the world, and our place\nin it.\nSo we should all support the idea\nof a superleague. If it is created the\nbalance will be redressed, and with a bit of effort university education will\nfinally become once more (or maybe\nin fact for the first time) what it\nalways should have been; education.\nTHE WEEKLY POEM supplied by poetic\nIn my wake...\nIn my wake, I think of you,\nA burn at my heart\nEveryday getting stronger.\nAnd as the wind lifts my soul,\nI wonder how we do\nTo stay apart,\nTo stay alone\nWith fear, I observe what we have done.\nA silence without end where we are both at fault;\nThe will to extend what cannot be.\nA passion destroyed by a dream.\nOur love destroyed by the ocean:\nWe shall stare for days into emptiness,\nWithout sound to reassure,\nAs the last days will leave.\nAshley Herrenschmmidt-Moller\nJune, 1996\nThis poem taken from A Selection of Member's Poetry, published by\nPoetIC, the society for creative writing at Imperial College.\nPoetIC welcomes new members.

    "content": "14 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER\nSport in brief\nBASKETBALL A week of defeats was to follow the\nbrilliant start of the season for the\nBasketball club teams. The ladies\nteam fought well for 35 minutes\nagainst the undoubtedly superior\nteam of Queen Mary, but played the\nprice for a reluctant start to the game.\nAt half-time Queen Mary headed off\n26-16, and an effort of the IC girls at\nthe beginning of the es cond half\nseemed to balance the game. Soon,\nhowever, Queen Mary restored their\nlead to 10 points, and in the last five\nminutes IC gave up, to eventually go\ndown by 59-34.\nOn Friday, the IC Men's second\nteam played their first match against\nSt Georges hospital. A defeat of 72-42 came as a natural consequence of\nthe lack of practice, but there is still\nplenty of time to make up, ready for\nthe next game.\nNETBALL IC netball ladies continued their\ngood start to the season with their\nthird win from four matches. In a very close game, IC fought hard\nthrough three qu at ers, keeping up\nwith Royal Holloway to start the\nfourth and final quarter trailing 6-9.\nIn a majestic spurt from all the members of the team, IC snatched victory\nfrom their old rivals.\nSNOOKER\nFollowing on from last week'sd is sap ointment at Warwick, both IC\nsnooker teams bounced back with\nsolid wins over Southampton in our\nfirst home matches of the season.\nIn the 'A' team, both Simon\nBaugh and Jon Fulcher were unbeaten throughout, and Vay Ly raised a cheer with a stunning 74 clearance\non the way to a14 frames to 6 vic to ry-The 'B' team also did the biz, and\navenged some past memories by\nwinning 14-11.\nCROSSCOUNTRY Richmond Park was the venue for\nthis tragic event. Everything was set\nup with Jennie coming first in the\nwomen's race, but a disappointing\nsecond place for the tactically inept\n\"Elvis\" McCallum left the Gary\nMoare crew distraught after the race.\nThe King's finish marred the performances of the rest of the IC team,\nprobably due to the fact that he ate\ntoo many burgers before the race.\nFischick improved to seventh,\nPonytail was consistent with twelfth,\nand Gaffer came thirteenth. Emily\nwas on top form, and the general performance ensures both the women\nand the men came first.\nIC Fencers demolish all-comers\nMEN The IC men's squad put on their best\nperformance of the season to demolish the Royal Holloway team, just\nmissing out on a whitewash. Again\nour foil team started off and coasted\npast Holloway 9-0, with Dave\nHughes stepping in in place of college no. 1 Henry Morton, and conceding just one hit in his three match-es. The sabre team continued their\nwinning streak, also winning 9-0,\nand finally the e pee team started out\n8-0 up until the final match, where\npartly due to an equipment problem\nwe lost 5-3. This gave an overall\nscore of 26-1.\nHappily, Holloway's fencing ability proved to be inversely proportional to their drinking ability, as they\njoined us for our first social event of\nthe year.\nThe members of our victorious\ndrinking squad were: Eddie, Dave\nHughes and Dave Davidge on foil;\nNigel, Phil, Reuben and Gavin on\ne pee; and Mo, Nick and Thorsten\nwith the sabre.\nWOMEN After a slow start to the season, with\ndefeats to strong teams from QMW\nand UCL, the IC women's team\nfinally got their act together, cr shing Royal Holloway 16-2.\nA couple of injuries left a team of\nthree fencing both weapons. Even so,\nthis was enough for IC to battle\nthrough, winning both the foil and\nthe e pee81. Especially impressive\non the day was Elaine Smith, winning two e pee fights, despite never\nhaving used the weapon before the\nmatch!.\nThe other team members were\nMonica Pingo-Almada and Davina\nWong.\nHockey Thirds march on, aided\nby Digger and Argos\n\"Argos\" proved to be a bargain buy\nin the pre-season rush for quality\nplayers when he hammered in a reverse stick tool kit at 60% of his\nrecommended retail price after just\n12 seconds.\nAfter the six minutes of time-out\nwhilst the Thirds celebrated this miracle from Heaven (in which \"Indian\nCarpet Catalogue\" completed a reverse double summer sault over the\nenemy scum's goal). Jesus rolled\nback the stone and made wine from\nwater by making a goal from nothing\nwhen he dribbled the ball from our\n25 line, with the St Georges defence\nparting like the Red Sea.\nThe \"Virgin\" provided the excitement and tension that was needed in\nthe 24th minute when following a pass from \"Vidal Sassoon\" he\nreverse flicked a blinder from the left\nof the D, confusing all the opposition\nwith his deft handy-work.\nAfter half-time, \"Indian Carpet\nCatalogue\" flew down the right-wing, as if on a magic carpet - he did-n't hang about, putting a goal in the\nright corner.\nSoon after, Skank stole through\nthe George's scum, despite their bad\naromas, taking the power from his\nenchanted woolly hat, and slipped\nthe ball up past the legs of their keep-er.\nBy this time St Georges were fuming at their own inadequacies, and\nwere resorting to abusing the\numpires, thus it was only a matter of\ntime before we were awarded a penalty strike.\nNow, last time our keeper, Digger,\nstepped up to the spot he disaster-ou aly missed, but being the kind soul\nhe is, our captain, Virgin, decided to\ngive him another chance. Digger dug\ndeep, and saw the light at the end of\nthe tunnel. That light was a penalty\nflick so fast the ball ripped through\nthe net, flew skywards and has not\nbeen seen since.\nThe final score, 6-0, was nothing\nless than a triumph.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER\nDrunken antics of senior MP\ncould bring down Government\nSIMON WISTOW\nIt was announced last week that the\nKensington and Chelsea Conservative MP, Sir Nicholas Scott, was to\nbe replaced after a drunken binge at\nthe Tory party conference left him\nunconscious in the gutter. Imperial\nCollege falls within the Kensington\nand Chelsea constituency.\nSir Nick, the former Northern\nIreland and Social security minister,\nhas had previous convictions for\ndrink driving and failing to stop after\nan accident last year that trapped a toddler in his crushed pushchair.\nControversy seems to have followed\nhim throughout his political career;\nhis wife announced that she was\nleaving him soon after his election in\n1974 despite appearing happily married just days before and in 1977 he\nnearly lost his place when members\nbecame worried about his drinking\nproblems and neglect of constituency\nduties.\nKensington & Chelsea constituent-cy executives voted 55 to 45 not to\nendorse a confidence vote in the 65\nyear old MP saying that they were\nshamed by his recent antics and in\nparticular his being found face down\nin a gutter outside the Irish Embassy\nin Bournemouth. Sir Nicholas is to\nspeak at a specially convened meeting of the Conservative Association\nto answer his critics. However, it is\nbelieved that replacements have\nalready been lined up. Fore-runners\nare thought to include Councillors\nJoan Hanham and her Royal\nBorough colleague Daniel Moylan.\nOther possible successors to Sir\nSir Nicholas Scott MP facing a barrage of questions over his dispute with\nthe Kensington and Chelsea Conservative Party. The local party could\nde select him, prompting Sir Nicholas to threaten to resign.\nNicholas include Chris Patten, currently Governor of Hong Kong and a favourite of Conservative Central\nOffice. Sir Nick has indicated that he\nwould stand aside at the next\nElection to allow Mr Patten to run for\nthe safe seat of Kensington and\nChelsea. The seat was returned in\n1992 with a majority of over 20,000.\nSir Nicholas claims that, following\na fall in the shower which resulted in\nan injured back, he was prescribed\npainkillers. \"My wife Cecilia tried to\npersuade me not to go to the party\nconference because I was in so much\npain, but I felt duty bound to go.\" He\nthen, rather stupidly, made the mistake of mixing alcohol and\npainkillers which allegedly caused\nhim to pass out. \"I decided to pop\ninto the Irish Embassy because I have\na lot of friends there from my\nNorthern Ireland days. I had a couple\nof glasses of white wine and began to\nfeel dizzy. I suffered from vertigo. It\nwas the painkillers. The next thing I remember was a policeman helping\nme up. I am kicking myself now for\ngoing to the conference when I was\nfeeling so ill. The publicity thing was\nacutely embarrassing. All this would\nnever have happened if I had listened\nto my wife.\"\nApart form local em baras s ment, the de selection of Sir Nicholas could\nhave far reaching ramifications for\nthe Conservative Government. The\nMP has threatened to resign his seat\nif des lect ed by the constituency\nparty, forcing the Government into a difficult situation with Parliamentary\nmechanics. Currently, the Government's majority in the House of\nCommons stands at two, up from one\nafter the death last week of a Labour\nMP. If Sir Nicholas resigns, the\nGovernment will lose it's majority,\nand will depend on the goodwill of\nthe Ulster Unionist Party to avoid\ndefeat in any Parliamentary division.\nOver the next few months, the\nGovernment's position will become\nmore fragile, and it will depend upon\nsmaller parties for support in important votes or issues of confidence.\nThe outcome of Sir Nicholas's spat\nwith his constituency party could\nwell prove the downfall of the current Government, and trigger an\nearly General Election.\nJerry Hayes breaks Tory line on AUT pay claim\ncontinued from front page\njust don't want it to escalate.\"\nWith the Imperial College Gun\nClub President attending the meet-ing, the former Parliamentary Private\nSecretary was questioned about the\nupcoming Government Firearms\nBill. Mr Hayes expressed his disappointment that the Bill was being\nintroduced but explained its necessity by saying that, \"we would be pilloried in the newspapers\" if the\nGovernment did not react to the\nmedia pressure.\nWith Mr Hayes recently appointed\nas the newest member of the\nStanding Committee on Firearms, he\nwas ideally placed to agree with suggestions that the new measures\nwould affect law abiding enthusiasts\nsaying \"a lot of people will lose their\nsport\". Mr Hayes did suggest that\ncurrent proposals might be watered\ndown during the Bill's passage\nthrough Parliament, expressing his\nhope that \"we can sort it out in\nCommittee.\"\nWith the Government's slim\nmajority, individual Members of\nParliament are able to exert considerable pressure on the Government for\namendments and the Essex MP stated his intention to \"cause trouble on\nthe Firearms Bill.\" Coupled with the\nlimited legislative time in this\nParliament before the Election, this\nwill ensure the Bill will have a rough\nride through the Commons. While\nadmitting that current proposals are\n\"rubbish\", Mr Hayes refused to confirm whether he would be voting\nagainst the controversial Bill but did\nsay that he would \"do what I can on\nthe old gun thing.\"\n\n"

Tuesday's strike has been\norganised by a consortium of eight\nunions with members working in\nHigher Education.\nThe strike has been called as a result of proposed national pay\nincreases of 1.5% for university staff,\nwhich union's insist constitutes a pay\ncut in real terms. This is being hailed\nas the first time in the history of\nHigher Education that every rank of\nstaff from \"Porter to Professor\" are\ngoing to close university gates.\nSupport for the strike has not been\nunam in io us, however, with three of\nthe union's that voted 'yes' only\nachieving a majority choosing industrial action of 2% or less. The turnout\nwas low, with an overall participation of just59%. Bryan Wilson, president of the IC branch of the\nAssociation of University Teachers\nclaimed that, in contrast to the normal turnout at a general election,\nwhich is generally less that 50%, this\nwas a \"reflection of the anger\" felt by\nstaff at \"paltry pay rises\". Mr Wilson\nalso commented that this decision\ncame from a group of people who are\nnormally reluctant to take any form\nof action at all.\nThe form the protest is taking\nincited criticism from both the college hierarchy and Imperial College\nUnion. Eric Allsop, the ICU pre si dent, said that he felt the strike was\n\"almost certainly justified\", but was\nconcerned at the possible effect on\nstudents, particularly that any higher\noffers would lead to a \"financial\nbacklash\" against the students and\nloss of staff. He said that he would\nnot encourage students to cross picket lines.\nThe Pro-Rector for Educational\nQuality, Professor Alan Swanson,\nwent further, dubbing the situation\n\"very messy\". Himself a member of\nthe AUT, he said that he would not\nbe joining the picket line, as he felt\nthe students were losing more than\ncould be gained. He also said that he\nwould be \"surprised if the\nGovernment turned in their tracks\"\nand reversed the decline in funding\nfor Higher Education simply as a result of the forthcoming strike.\nProfessor Swanson said that he\ncould not guess at the likely support\nfor the strike, but believed that\namong the technical staff it would be\n\"pretty solid\". This would mean the\nshutdown of all labs, though he\npledged that students would not be\n\"unjustly penal is ed\" for missing lab\nsessions if there was a strike. He\nwarned, however, that it is not up to\nstudents whether to turn up or not,\nand left it to Heads of Department to\nadvise students about what to do on\nTuesday.\nThe Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh\nhas written to all staff advising them\nof the College's position, and\nreminding them that the strike would\nmean the loss of a day's pay. The\nAUT have asked the College to\ndonate any deducted staff pay to the\nStudent Hardship Fund.\nBryan Wilson appealed to the student population, asking that the strikers have \"if not their support, at least\ntheir understanding.\"\nm\\ Weekend this week,\nwin CDs, read all\ni about duty free\nplus Tricky.\nIC strike bound?\nPHOTO: MATTHEW KEMPTON\nHis Royal Highness Prince Phillip visiting the Royal College of Music on\nWednesday for an evening concert.

In an open and\nfrank meeting arranged by Imperial\nCollege Conservative Society he\nrefused to condemn the action\nplanned for next Tuesday, saying of\nthe striking personnel, \"It is their\ndemocratic right.\"\nEven when urged by the former\nIC ConSoc Chair to condemn the\none day strike, Mr Hayes refused,\nsaying that he was not in the business\nof condemning strikes. While admitting that he had forgotten to \"mug up\non\" the higher education dispute\nbefore addressing the Imperial\nCollege gathering, the 43 year old\nMP said that he could \"understand\"\nhow lecturers feel.\nThe Member of Parliament for\nHarlow did suggest however that,\n\"The worst way of dealing with the\nTory Government is to go on strike.\"\nWith pressure by right wing student\nmembers to oppose the national stoppage Mr Hayes did admit that \"Of\ncourse, it [the strike action] is not\ngoing to work\", later saying that \"we\ncontinued on page four\nMP threatens majority, page four\n\n"

However \"the Slags\" immediately rallied, showing the grit and\nsteel that makes a man - an attitude\nthat says \"You wanna fight? Fight\nme!\" With this attitude, our fortunes\ncan only continue to rise.\nA free kick from the half-way line\ngave debut ant lone-striker Robo the\nchance to lay it off, a mis-hit shot rattled Gold's defence and was neatly\nfinished off by young Dave. At halftime Captain Courageous Steve\nchanged to a flat back four, as the\nright wing-backs had so far failed to\nexploit the space available to them.\nUnfortunately a culmination of\nappa ling refereeing, bad light and\ninspirational finishing from\nGoldsmiths meant that with five\nminutes to go, IC were 5-1 down.\nWith light fading rapidly, and the\ngame descending rapidly into a brawl, the referee awarded a free-kick to IC - and presumably acting\non a new FIFA directive, proceeded\nto strangle the dissenting Golds\nright-back! The home team struggled\nto separate the two, and the match\nwas abandoned five minutes early.\nAn ignominious end to the Seconds\nunbeaten run.\nRugby Thirds\nfinally show\ntheir mettle\nWith a new 15 man composition,\nlast minute preparations were made\nto set plays. The team pulled together from the kick-off, instantly converting effort into points. The fat\nugly lads showed the gir lies what\nscoring tries is all about.\nThe Viking opened the scoring,\nwith his second of the season. The\nreturn of Dan Seaman was christened with a try. Bashari, Yommi,\nCharlie Joint and captain Tom\nHoward also added trys to a magnificent final total. To add to the humiliation, a tactical substitution only\nminutes from the end of the match\nresulted in another two tries, to leave\nthe final score 44-0. Christophe\nSudgen once again demonstrated his\nlack of speed, made up by shear size\nand skill.\nDamn good game.\nRSM Footballers\nvictorious on all\nfronts\nFIRSTS\nA good game, with RSM proving\nthat their first game of the season\nwas no freak. A brilliant goal by\nKersten set up the scoring; goals\nfrom Si, Johan and two by Michael\nf oll wed. Ten minutes into the second-half,\nRSM were down to ten men, as\nKersten went off injured, allowing\nthe defence to earn their keep, as IC\nheld out for the rest of the match.\nFinal score 5-0\nSECONDS UCL proved a difficult team to play\nin the first-half. However the sec-on d half saw RSM playing the opposition out of the game. In the end,\nUCL were lucky to get away with\nonly four against them.\nFinal score 4-0\nIC Waterpolo storm into London\nnumber one spot\nThe first round of the BUSA water-polo competition was played last\nweekend and resulted in a resounding victory for the hosts, IC.\nOriginally planned as a tournament\nwith five teams, three made last\nminute cancellations leaving only IC\nand St Mary's to play off for the\npositions of first and second London\nCollege seeds.\nDespite having only the minimum\nnumber of players allowed, St\nMary's put up spirited resistance to\nan IC team consisting of several\nnational league and international\nplayers.\nGoal followed goal as the medics\nwere unable to meet the superior\nspeed and skills of the home team.\nThe result was a crushing 15-2 score-line which did not really reflect the\neven greater difference in the abilities of the two teams.\nThe result is that both St Mary's and IC go through to the next round\nof the BUSA competition, which\nwill be a tournament against various\nother universities. This is due to take\nplace on the 23rd of November, and\nany spectators would be warmly\nreceived and appreciated.\nIC rule the waves\nIC Boat Club got off to a successful\nstart to the season in the Fullers\nFours Head on Saturday.

    "content": "8 NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 15TH NOVEMBER\nNHS LONDON\nAccording to reliable sources at the University of\nLondon Union, colleges of higher and further\neducation throughout the capital have responded\npositively to the setting up of a new London NUS\nregional representative body. The motion to\ninvestigate the feasibility of such a venture was\npass da the GUC meeting of ULU three weeks\nago.\nTHE PAST\nThe idea of having an NUS regional representative body in London is not new. In fact, it did exist\nuntil last year. Unfortunately, it was the opinion\nof most student representative groups at the time\nthat their views were not given due consideration\nby the regional body. In the end, amidst allegations that the financial regulations laid down by\nthe NUS had not been followed, the organisation\nwas put under severe financial difficulties.\nUnhappy with the situation, some of the bigger\ncolleges withdrew from this pact, and the NUS\nLondon folded soon after.\nIC AND THE NUS\nThe relationship between Imperial College Union\nand the NUS has never been smooth. IC graduates\nhelped found the NUS back in 1922. However, a row over affiliation fee prompted the withdrawal\nof ICU. It rejoined again in 1939, but pulled out a few years later due to their dispute with the NUS\nover the Government's policy of graduate con-script ion. After the war, the Union had r caffi li at ed with the NUS four more times. The most\nrecent walk out dated back to 1977 - scepticism\nover the radical policy pursued by the NUS led to\nthe d is affiliation motion being passed by a narrow\nmargin of 5 votes.\nTHE PURPOSE\nCurrently, 150 colle g cation in London 1\nand further edu-present at ives to\nforum where members from different universities\nin London can exchange their ideas regularly.\nNetworking of this kind not only helps to promote\ninter-college co-ordination in fighting for the\ninterests of the general student population, but the\nsheer number of students represented by this body\n(around 200,000, of which 70,000 arc from\nUniversity of London) will also provide more lobbying power.\nFor colleges already affiliated to ULU, it offers\nthem the valuable opportunity to communicate\nwith people from the further education sector,\nmany of whom will eventually end up studying at\nthe University of London. Concerns over ULU\nover stretching its limited manpower by taking an\nactive part in this forum are unfounded. Sources at\nULU confirmed that only their vice-president,\nPaul Bates, would be involved in this. It has also\nbeen pointed out categorically by Sarah White,\ncurrent president of ULU, that time spent on each\nproject is carefully monitored.\nWhilst nationwide issues such as the threat of\ntop-up fees, poverty among students, and resurgence of extremism on campuses will be dis-With all the recent press concerning the\nNational Union of Students and their change\nof policy over Higher Education funding,\nFelix explores the history of the NUS and its\nill-fated London Region.\nOn this page Kent Yip takes through the\nlast throes or NUS London, and opposite,\nSimon Wistow reveals the extent of discontent across the country.\nCONCERNS\nCynics argue that the NUS has a history of pursuing impractical policy. They came to their sense\nlast year and abandoned their campaign for the\nreturn to full grants after a long fought campaign\nby those espousing free education. The futility of\ntheir effort was evident. Related to this was the\nsuspension of Clivc Lewis, the ex-Vicc-Presidcnt\nEducation who disagreed with this change of pol-icy. The leadership of the NUS was label ld as \"a disgrace to all students\" by Labour MPs Tony\nBenn, Ken Livingstone and Dennis Skinner\n(London Students, volume 17 issues 1 and 2).\nFurthermore, the NUS is also regarded by some as\nmerely al auch pad for future Labour politicians.\nThey pointed to Jim Murphy, the ex-prc sident of\nthe NUS, as an example. His proposal of \"g radu ate tax\", enthusiastically adopted by Labour as\ntheir official party policy, has earned him the candidacy to represent Labour for the parliamentary\nseat for Eastwood in Strathclyde. All of these\nhave led people to cast doubts over the representative nature of the organisation, and wonder if the\nwhole business is merely a big publicity stunt.\nm mm\n4tS~t T/ \u00bb T/ \u00bb yOT \u00ab\nmm\nreflect the views of their students, and the mair\nrole of the NUS regional body will be to rectify\nthis wor rina situation. Moreover, it will also be <\ncussed in their regular meetings, attention will be\nfocused on matters specific to students in London,\neg, difficulties in finding suitable ac como dati on and negotiations for transport discounts.\nTHE TRUTH\nIt is a well known fact that the majority of students are not interested in politics. The discounts\navailable in purchasing food, alcohol and other\nitems is the main reason why most unions choose\nto belong to the NUS. This is also why IC has\nopted out; because we already have contracts with\nseveral big purchasing groups, it would be pointless to switch to the NUS. Their recent call for\na nationwide student strike has been endorsed\nby most student unions across the country,\nut in truth, who in their right mind would\nview it as anything other than an unscheduled\nday-off. If the government is not responding to\npressures from vice-chancellors and principals of the colleges, it there any chance they\nwould even know of such a \"strike\" planned\nby the NUS?\nWHAT NEXT ?\nThe Utopic ideals they hold have somewhat been\novershadowed by their unprofessional attitude\ntowards non-affiliated members. Any detected\nbias against the NUS in this article can partly be\nexplained by their lack of co-operation in answering my questions during my research. Since the\nprevious London NUS regional representative\nbody failed to leave behind an illustrious track\nrecord, it is sad to see them turning down an\n\n"
