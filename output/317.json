    "content": "Page 2 FELIX November 7, 1972\nAbsolutely the last\nIAN MACKENZIE'S PRESIDENT'S COLUMN The last month has not been an easy one for ICU. A Union with a temporary president is handicapped in that there is unlikely to be the\nusual degree of continuity over the year. The lack of a publicity\nofficer and moreover the non-availability of much of the Union building further handicapped the Union. However, the non-election of a President at the last elections must surely be the most severe blow.\nICU vs CCU's Last year relations between ICU and the Constituent College Unions\nwere very good, with the\nCCU's being predominantly social units within\nICU. However, the hand\nthat the CCU leaders took\nin the ICU presidential\nelections has made many\npeople feel that we're returning to the bad old\ndays. I don't believe that\nthis is the case, and expect the CCU's to do all\nthey can to ensure that\nICU gets a good president,\nand to continue to support ICU.\nlAN'S VIEW\nDespite my relatively\nshort stay as President,\nthere are a number of\nideas that I must try to\npass on. Over the last 3\nyears, the Union made\nconsiderable advances in\nboth representation on\ncollege bodies and promotion of Union policies,\noften at a cost of good\nrelations with the admin\nof the College. The Union\nis now settling down to\nUSE its greater influence\nin the College, and relations with admin are now\nvery good. I hope that this\nstate continues.\nAs far as the Union it-self, the most unsatisfactory areas are the old\nstumbling blocks of information, communication\nand Union Meetings.\nUNION MEETINGS\nUnion meetings can\nonly be really meaningful\nif above 600 people at-tend. At present they are\nroughly every two or three\nweeks and are generally\nconcurrent with other\nlunch time events. I would like to see ONE\nUnion Meeting per month\n(with first lecture in the\nafternoon cancelled so\nthat the meeting could\nrun from 1.15 to 3.15)\nwith nothing in competition with it (i.e. STOIC\ncould run from 12.45 to\n13.15). Only then could\nUnion meetings be seen\nto be important, and\nworthwhile.\nINFORMATION And now for a few\nquick ideas. The Room at\nthe Top should be fully\noperative as an information centre, but there is\nstill a need for someone\n(information officer?) to\nspend the first couple of\nweeks of terms compiling\nthe Union Directory and\nthen looking after the information side at the\nRoom at the Top and the\ngreat amount of outside\nbump h sent to the Union\nOffice.\nAlso it is about time we\nhad a NUS secretary\nwhose responsibility is just\nto look after the masses\nof bump h sent by NUS to\neach constitute nt organ-is ation. This burden at\npresent falls on either the\nPresident or the External\nAffairs Officer.\nLastly, communication.\nI 've no doubt a weekly\nFelix is helping greatly\nhere, but ICU still needs\nto improve its use of the\nthree main notice board\nareas.\nFinally, I'd like to wish\nwhoever takes on the post\nof President the very best\nof luck, and to thank\nMCB and PWI for the\nwork they've already put\nin.\nCumberland Lodge \u2014 Garden View\nA way from it all. . .\nYou may have been to a Touchstone weekend at Silwood Park \u2014 but did\nyou know that, only a short distance away in Windsor Great Park, similar weekend conferences for students are held at \"Cumberland Lodge\"?\nAdministered by the \"King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Foundation of\nSt. Catherine's,\" Cumberland Lodge, offers regular Friday evening to Monday\nmorning residential conferences on wide-ranging topics at \u00a34.75. Perhaps a great\nadvantage over \"Touchstone\" weekends is that these give an opportunity to meet\nand discuss with students of other disciplines from other University colleges,\nPolytechnics and Colleges of Education. ^\nForthcoming weekends include \"Chomsky and the Revolution in Linguistics\"\non December l sl3r d, \"The Value of News Film to the Historian\" (December\n15th18 th), a Music Weekend for all amateur student instrumentalists (la nua ry5 th8 th), \"The Sea\" (Fqbruery 2nd5 th), and later ones on Cryptography (codes),\nGenetics and Heretics and several other subjects.\n. St. Catherine's is also open to students for private study. It has well-equipped\nsingle study-bedrooms, libraries, reading rooms and good recreational facilities \u2014\nall for only \u00a310 a week.\nIf you would like further information, send your name and address to Felix,\nUnion, Office, by Internal mail marking it \"St. Catherine's\", and we will pass it on\nwithout delay \u2014 or come and browse through the brochure in the Felix Office.\nMany readers of FELIX will have noticed that there was no MARTIN'S PIT last week. To make up for this loss \u2014 due, I am afraid,\nto a very busy week culminating in my birthday, Commemoration\nDay and the Maths Freshers' Dinner in quick succession, I now offer\nto you, dear readers, a double portion of\nMARTIN'S BIT\non &e \u00a3t gnat i ott \u00a3\nIt may come as a shock to some members of ICU to hear that, at Thursday's UG MI tendered to Ian\nMackenzie on behalf of the Union, my resignation. My resignation, NOT as Secretary to the Union (failed\nagain\u2014Ed.) but as a member and leader of the delegation to the November Conference of the NUS at Margate.\nThe reasons for this resignation are three-fold\nand I feel that the Union\nis entitled to a brief ex-pla nation. FIRSTLY, Ian Mackenzie's term of office as\nActing President, as defined and agreed at the\nend of last year, has now\nexpired and Ian has returned to his structural\nvibrations in the bowels of\nthe Aeronautics depart-ment. This means that, although Ian will be con-tin u ing, pro tern, as the\ntitular head of the Union,\nhe will not be able to devote a great deal of time\nto the job and I will, as\nthe sole sabbatical officer,\nhave to spend much of\nmy time doing the more\nmundane and routine of\nhis duties as well as my\nown. Thus I will not have\nthe time to do the re-searches, background\nreading and to generally\nmake myself au fait with\na good proportion of the\ntopics that will be discussed at the conference.\nIt would be advantageous\nto understand the system\nthat governs the organisation and administration of\nNUS \u2014 a bureaucracy\nthat not even I can\nmatch!!\nSECONDLY, the timetable of the re-election is\nsuch that the ballot will\ntake place on Friday 24th and Monday 27th November; this is the weekend\nof the conference. I could\nappoint an Acting Returning Officer, but would\nnot feel able to accept\ntotal responsibility for the\nrunning of the election unless I organised it person-ally.\nTHIRDLY, I have during the past month received criticism from\nvarious quarters about my\nattitudes to the National\nUnion of Students. IC\nUnion will learn of these\nin due course but suffice\nit to say, at the present\ntime, that I do not think\nthat we get value for\nmoney out of NUS. I, personally, do not wish to\nhelp perpetuate a system\nin which I have no faith.\nI would strongly dispute any suggestion that\nmy resignation is a reaction to the attitude of\nthe Union meeting to Mr.\nCorbyn's proposal that he\nbe allowed to attend the\nconference as a representative of a Union of Students of Imperial College\neven though, at the time\nof the meeting, he was\nNOT a full time registered\nstudent of Imperial College. I realise that my\nactions will be taken by\nsome to be \"sour grapes\u2122\n\u2014 this was at no time in-tended.\non Commemoration \u00a9ap\nTo put the records\nstraight (i)I was no more\nasleep than Lord Sherfield\n(Chairman of the Governing Body) and (ii) Professor Sir Derek Barton\nwas the gentleman wearing the light blue silk hat\nthat looked like the bastard offspring of a liaison\nbetween a chandelier and\na tea cosy.\nThe Commemoration\nBall was an unqualified\nsuccess. For the first time\nin living memory we had\nto turn down applications\nfor tickets because there\nwas not sufficient room in\nthe Dining Hall to accommodate more than 402\npeople. Everybody seemed\nto be enjoying themselves\nand the following day the\nUnion Office was exceptionally quiet, as the Exec,\nemerged from the alcoholic haze into which they\nhad sunk earlier that\nmorning, to which end I insisted that conversation\nshould take place only in\nwhispers and that the\ntelephone bells should be\ndamped.\non Jlotor p tcp tte s People who bring motor cycles into the college precincts are asked by the College\nto register them with the Security Office, Room 164 College Block.

    "content": "FELIX November 7, 1972\nA Message\nfrom the\nManaging\nDirector\nIt has been brought to my notice that, yet again,\nwe have employees daubing graffiti over company\nproperty.\nLet me remind you that this section of property\nhas only just been repainted after a similar incident\nlast year. You must all realise that i am the head of\nthis firm and as such expect to be obeyed\u2014I do not\nwrite these news sheets just to see my name in\nprint. I warn you that unless the culprits have the\ngraffiti removed then I will have it removed and\nsend the bill to the local Trade Union branch. I am sorry for those many innocent people who are\nnot involved but you must keep your black sheep in\ncheck.\nGood Lord, you can't expect me to do everything.\nThe personnel manager, Mr. BERTIE MEEANDHISMISSUSDENYEVERYTH1NG, reports that we\nemploy a substantial number of self-styled artists.\nWell, let me tell you, this company is going to\nthe wall, we're not a benevolent society for out of\nwork artists.\nIf there are people who are not kept busy enough\nabout their work then it's high time that they picked\nup their ideas and moved on. That's the trouble\nwith this generation\u2014no gratitude. I worked hard\nto get where I am and feel that my conscience is\nsatisfied\u2014-I 've done my bit for the country.\nIf there was a little more respect for both the management (who work jolly hard to keep this place\nticking over) and company property then there\nwould be no need for tempers to flare.\nHow many times do I have to remind you about\nmatters.of simple common sense. Talking about\ncommon sense, Mr. JOSHUA MOONEYISTHEROOTOFALLCOOKING tells me that the vending\nmachine in the canteen will be out of action for a few weeks because of gross stupidity on the part of\nthe day shift. When the vending machine starts\nsmoking and making funny noises, you don't all\nstand around pointing and laughing. It was two\nhours before anybody had the good sense to turn the\nwretched thing off.\nWe can't afford to keep replacing items that aren't directly involved in production. Because of this, I am going to have to reduce the management's donation to the workers' an nua! outing.\nif you want a fight, then you have come to the\nright man: but don't complain if you get hurt in the\nprocess.\nKARL DONTBRINGYOURTROUBLESTOMESONI'VEGOTENOUGHOFMYOWN.\nI'm sorry,\nProfessor,\nwe've decided\nyou're obsolete\nIs your lecturer really necessary? Is the guy who's been boring the pants off you for the last hour\nreally indispensable? Whether you're the department whizz-kid or this year's dummy, you don't really need him\u2014let's take a look in the staff\ncommon-room\n\"Right now, lads\", says the Head of Department to his assembled teaching staff. \"Let's see\nwho gets the second year Systems course\". He\ndelves into the hat and pulls out a piece of paper.\n\"Sorry Alistair. That's one for you. Now, there's a fifteen lecture course we're introducing in optimisation. What wants that one, then eh? . . .\"\nThere's an old adage that you go into a lecture\nand write down what the lecturer puts up on the\nboard but the message goes neither through his\nhead or through yours. That's not you? Well, have\nyou ever picked up notes to revise them for exams\nand never remembered writing them a few months\nbefore? No? Yes? If you have, you're with me; If you haven't, if you're destined for a first, if you're\nthe year's whizz-kid, you're with me too.\nRight, a lecturer must do a certain amount of\nteaching. He's researching in some specialised\nfield and he gives a lecture course in a remotely\nallied subject which he vaguely recollects from his\nstudent days. He picks up the appropriate text-book\nand makes notes condensing the subject matter into\nthe required number of lecture periods. In the same\nway that the material, to all intents and purposes,\ndoesn't pass through your head, neither does it pass\nthrough is. It merely follows a rather tortuous path\nfrom the text-book to the student via an ostensibly\nunnecessary middle-man.\nThat is, of course, an unkind generalisation.\nThere are many lecture courses for which no decent\ntext-book exists and the lecture notes are the only\nreliable dossier. But the lecturer is still dispensable.\nHe simply gives out printed notes, the equivalent of\na text-book, and you start from there. To help over\ntroublesome points tutorials and seminars are still\nrequired though these need not be formal and can\nsimply be in the way of advice from others on the\ncourse where necessary.\nArmed with a text-book or series of printed notes,\na resume of the course topics, and a set of past\npapers and examples to aid understanding, you get\nthrough the exam. (Isn't that how we all start, two\nweeks before the finals date?).\nPresupposing that the object of the lecture course\nwas to enable the student to pass an examination at\nthe end (and how many courses at IC are not?) the\nlecturer was, and is, obsolete.\n\"Oh, oh\", says the Professor, as the coin lands\nface-up. \"Old Robert's got that forty lecture\ncourse in materials again. That's two years running now, isn't it, Bob?\". (Consoling laughter).\nMARTIN DOUGHTY.\nImprovisation\non a theme\nSome (many?) people don't know what they're\nmissing\u2014but maybe the quality of fringe happenings in I.C. is in inverse proportion to their\nnotoriety.\nWednesday lunchtime crept into the twi lit afternoon in crescendos of wolf-howling s, recurring images of Oedipean (literally) apprehensions and ancient Athenian hang-ups given the\ncome-down by actors and audience occasionally\nfalling about in in capac it a tory laughter\u2014RADA\nwas loaning I.C. some of its first year talent in\npart-exchange for a stage plus some people to\nwatch them rehearse/perform/interpret \"Oedi-pus Rex\": he was the guy, you remember, who\ntook his mother to bed after murdering his father\n\u2014for those of us who've had the Freudian wool\npulled over our eyes, the message in fact is that\nyou can't sidestep what's lined up for you just\nby knowing about it beforehand (inveterate peru-s ers of Astra Nova, Gipsy Petulengro et al, watch\nout. . .).\nSo it's a good choice of play to take apart and\npublicly re synthesis e anyway, with constant\ntension between suspense and fore known doom,\ncontaining as well some encapsulated scenes of\ncondensed and self-evident conflict\u2014but the\nplay aside, what was happening in front of our\neyes was worth a hundred straight performances.\nProbably some us had preconceptions about\ndrama students\u2014the stereotyped intense intro-vert, maybe, a veritable Hamlet man que, or the\nflamboyant extrovert, laying his trip on everyone\nin sight. Well, forget it\u2014these people worked\nreally hard, not just to perfect a 'technique', but\nto push themselves and each other to the limit of\nunderstanding and of translation of understanding\ninto concrete action. Which is their technique; no\nmagical Method, no dissociation of 'what' and\n'how'. Their director, Angela Langfield, was trying to show how they'd previously developed the\nplay from a naturalistic performance to a formalised one, with the implicit (and plainly visible)\npoint that formality, carefully evolved out of what\nthe students feel while they're rehearsing, elicits\nmore sense and depth from a performance than\nplaying it 'naturally'. It's clear, for instance, that\nif you try putting over a scene without using the\ntext, but barking and growling instead, you're\nmore or less forced into finding out what it is\nyou're really aiming to get across . . . could liven\nup some lectures not a million miles from here?\nMost of the audience was, I gather, from I.C. Dram Soc, so their involvement and interest may\nhave been, appropriately, quite specialised and\ntaken for granted. But for me, it was an unexpected and tangible experience of the exploration and exploitation of things I normally\ndon't question\u2014sounds, words, emotions, inhibitions. Well, there's a lot more I could say, but it's better and more fun to see it. If you want a glimpse of how another half lives, keep a look out\nfor posters later on\u2014they've promised to return\nfor a repeat.\nLESLEY SAUNDERS.\nClassical Concerts\nThursday, the second of November, was a day for\nTchaikovsky and Beethoven lovers. The precincts\nof South Kensington were treated to two very worthwhile concerts. The first, one of the General Studies\nseries, was held in the Maths Department library\nwhich, as usual, was packed with an expectant\naudience.\nIn writing his Opus 59, the three Rasoumovsky\nquartets, Beethoven issued a great challenge to the\nartistic and technical abilities of its performers.\nThe Georgian String Quartet were able to meet this\nchallenge with a truly excellent performance of the\nNo. 1 quartet, in which the warmth of the music\ncame across to a very high degree.\nOne reason for this apparent warmth is, per-hap s, that chamber music was originally written for\nthe private room, rather than the concert hall, and\nn this respect the library at 53 Princes Gate provides the ideal surroundings for such a concert.\nAs to the technical aspect of the performance,\nthe 'cellist, David Smith, was able to produce from\nhis in s rumen t the strong and positive effect which\nis so much a requirement of the Rasoumovskys and\nthis together with the other fine playing resulted in\na most enjoyable lunch hour concert.\nThe Concert Hall at the Royal College of Music\nwas the scene that evening for the Students Association Orchestral Concert. The orchestra, conducted by Russell Harris, played a programme consist ng of the Overture to Rossini's Barber of Seville,\nTchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7.\nAfter a competent performance of the overture,\nthe soloist of the evening, Ronan Magill, sat down\nat the keyboard. In retrospect perhaps this performance of the concerto illustrated how much the role\nof the conductor is taken for granted and how vital\nit really is.\nMr. Magill's interpretation of the concerto was\nnot only original and individual in its tempo but\nalso contained beautiful contrasting between\" the\npowerful and stirring sections of say the 1st movement and the softer more lyrical passages. It is a shame that the orchestra could not match the excellence of his performance, this lack of match becoming more obvious in the slow movement which\nrequires such delicate orchestration and perfect\ntiming.\nIn spite of these difficulties Ronan Magill succeeded in holding the whole work together and\nended the concerto with a very positive and definite\n\"Allegro con fuoco\".\nThe success of and the enjoyment provided by\nMr. Magill's performance was apparent from the\nloud level of applause and numerous calls he re-ce i ved. With such a performance in only his second\nyear at the college there can be little doubt that\nMr. Magill will go a long way in his career.\nAfter the interval Mr. Harris conducted Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, and by the third movement seemed to have regained control of the\norchestra, providing what was also an enjoyable\nconclusion to the evening.\n\n"

    "content": "November 7, 1972 FELIX Page 5\nFELIX FINANCIALLY Last month on this page, Derek E. Cummings wrote a scathing\narticle on the subject of insurance salesmen. In this issue, he\ndeals with the problem of house prices. These are only the first\nof a series of hard-hitting features on the financial world which\nFELIX proposes to feature regularly in future issues under the\ntitle \" FELIX FINANCIALLY \". In view of the interest already\naroused by his last piece, we thought it worthwhile to ask him\nwhat subjects he expects to write about in the future.\n\"// you read my last\narticle \u2014 and I hope you\ndid \u2014 you will have\ngathered that its purpose\nwas to strip some of the\nmystery surrounding the\nbusiness of life assur-ance. Similarly, the feature on house prices in\nthe adjacent columns is\nintended to briefly explain why it is that house\nprices continually rise\nThe aim of \"FELIX\nFinancially\" is to present all such financial\nand commercial problems that are likely to\naffect you in the near\nfuture (if they have not\nalready done so) with the\nsame kind of realism. In\nother words, to remove\nthe mystique and reveal\nthe facts as I see them.\nSo far, we have taken a look at insurance and\nhouse prices. Next week\nI shall be suggesting\nsome of the ways in\nwhich the seemingly impossible difficulties of\nhouse purchase might be\novercome.\nFollowing that, I shall\nhave a few words to say\nabout banks, banking\nand bank managers and\ntheir attitude to stud-ents. We all know what\nthe banks promise, just\nas we know that they do\nnot always live up to\nthem. But why should\nthere be a difference between the wrapping and\nthe goods? What should\nwe \u2014and what can we\n\u2014 expect from a bank\nmanager? Well, read and\nfind out.\nThen there are the\nother institutions . . . the\nBuilding Societies. I plan\nto put the manager of\none of the Big Three\nsocieties through the\nhoop and make him explain to you, in simple\nlanguage, what his business is and how he goes\nabout it.\nWhat about student\naccommodation ? Now,\nthere's a subject to raise\nthe temperature of\nnearly all students. Petitions, strikes, demonstrations and arguments\nfill the air \u2014 while the\nproblem gets worse and\nworse. I believe I know\nwhat should be done,\nwhat can be done\u2014and,\nmost important, how it\ncan be done. It'll take a whole page of \"Felix\",\nbecause it's such a big\nsubject. But it'll be\nworth your while reading it.\nWhat do you know\nabout soliciting ? (or\nshould I say solicitors? ).\nIf you ever buy a house,\nyou'll need one. But is it\nnecessary to get bogged\ndown in words before\nyou get the deeds?\nAccountants are another strange breed who\nprefer to remain\nshrouded in mystery.\nThey may be of help to\nyou one day \u2014 provided\nyou understand what you\nreally need them for.\nFew people do.\nMotor insurance? A necessary evil, perhaps.\nBut why should a motorist insure cheaply with a backyard company and\nrisk following Dr. Savundra down the drain? Or\npay through the nose for\nrespectability? I 've more\nthan a few words to say\non this whole area of\ninsurance.\nSo that's it. These are\nsome of the well-established windmills I shall\nbe tilting my lance at in\nthe near future. My\narticles will be controversial. You may well\ndisagree with some of\nthe things I say. You will\nwant to know more\nabout others. If you write\nto me c/o \"Felix\", I 'll\nattempt to answer your\nquestions. And I 'll look\nforward to seeing you at\nmy General Studies lectures in January.\nNow read on . . .\n12,000 SINGLE\nHOMELESS IN\nLONDON\nIn a recent survey organised by the St. Mungo Community Trust just under 12,000 single homeless men\nand women were discovered in London. 1,400 volunteers, of which 60 were from Imperial College, took\npart in the survey. On the night of Friday, 20th October they searched every street, derelict area and derelict\nhouse in the 15 boroughs of Inner London. Included\nin the figures were the homeless people in lodging\nhouses, prison cells and hospitals.\nOf the homeless people Commenting on the sur-over 1,400 were sleeping vey, Jim Home, director of\nthe St. Mungo Community\nTrust, said \"These figures\ncan only be a guide. In\nmany areas there were less\nmen and women than we\nhave seen on other occasions. We think a number\nof do ssc irs had \"gone to\nground\" knowing of the\nsurvey, and police activity\nalso led to reduced num-be rs\". He also said that the\nsurvey w oui ld be followed\nup by a monitoring in the\nvarious areas to compile\ncomparative figures and\nthe recruitment of volunteers to participate in their\nmobile medical unit and\nAdvisory Centre.\nrough, 470 in Westminster\nalone. The figure for Kensington was 40. There were\n9,000 in common lodging\n\" houses, 500 in prisons,\nover 700 in reception c en tres, 246 in hospital and\n45 in police custody. No\nfigure was available for\nmental hospitals; the last\nsurvey of these inti tut ions was in 1957 when the figure for no fixed abode in\nmental hospitals was 1,500\nBefore the 20th October, preliminary surveys\ncarried out in the individual boroughs. The results\nof these differed from\nthose of the big survey\nquite considerably in some\nareas. For example the\npilot survey in Westminster counted 960 dos s ers. The survey cannot be\nconsidered to be completely accurate since in certain\nareas the number of dos-s ers counted was exceptionally low due to inefficient organisation. For ex-ample, in Southwark, a borough with a high dos-ser population, the derelict\nhouse squad only covered\nhalf its area. Also the figure quoted for the number\nof dos s ers in police cells\ncannot be considered to be\naccurate since, for ex-ample, Bow Street admitted to having 3 dos s ers in custody yet 38 were\nbrought before the court in\nthe morning.\nThe purpose of the survey was to make the General Public more aware of\nthe magnitude of the situ a tion, and the Government\naware of its responsibility\nto alleviate this growing\nproblem. The information\nwill be correlated in the\nform of a paper, to be presented to the Government\nin order that realistic support be given to the homeless single person and to\nthose organisations involved in helping them.\nIt is thus not yet known\nif the survey was a success.\nHouse prices:\nUp, Up and\neven further Up\nHOUSE PURCHASE IN THE FUTURE:\nSome time in the future, we think, the majority\nof you are going to get involved in the business of\nbuying a house. It's going to be an expensive business\u2014in fact, the biggest financial deal many of\nyou will ever do. So it's well worth thinking about.\nYou may have read recently what appears to be\nencouraging news about the future of house prices.\nEncouraging, because the tenor of these arguments\nis that house prices are now s tabi lising and that\nthe boom\u2014or racket, if you prefer\u2014in house prices\nis fading away.\nWell, we're sorry, but we don't agree.\nThere are basic economic factors which govern the price of housing,\nnamely the old bugbear\nof supply and demand.\nAnd those factors still\napply\u2014and they'll go on\napplying for some time\nyet. In short, there are\nstill too many people\nlooking for too few\nhouses, and there will\nstill be more people\nthan houses for at least\nthe next ten years. The\nroot of the matter is\nquite simple. There was\nan enormous population\nexplosion in this country\nat the end of the war.\nThe sociological reasons\nfor that are fairly obvious\nand well known. What is\nnot quite so well appreciated is that this population boom carried on\nuntil well into the 1950s \u2014until 1958 to be exact.\nPRICES . . .\nNow, the parallel between the population\nboom in 1945 and the\ndizzy rise in house prices\nin the late 1960s and\nthe early 1970s is quite\nexact. All those post-war\nbabies born in 1945\nwere, at about 25 years\nyears old, surging onto\nthe housing market \u2014\nand the boom really began to go with a bang.\nOk, so now we know\nwhy houses prices went\nup so steeply. But let's just refresh our memories a moment and look\nat a few figures, showing\njust how steeply they\ndid go up.\nWe'll start with a three-bedroomed, semi-detached house built in\n1938. It sold then for,\nsay, six hundred pounds.\nBetween then and now,\nthere has been a war and\na consequent population\nboom. And this is what\nit did to the price of our\nhouse:\n1938: It sold for \u00a3600.\n1945: The end of t he\nwar. The start of\nthe population\nboom.\n1948: The house sold\nfor \u00a31200.\n1951: The population\nexplosion reflected in the education bulge.\n1958: The house sold\nfor \u00a33,000. The\npopulation growth\nslows down.\n1968: The house now\nworth \u00a36,000.\n1969: Still \u00a36,000.\n1970: Still \u00a36,000, but\nnow the 1945\nchildren are beginning to come\nonto the house\npurchase market.\n1971: The house sells\nfor \u00a37,500. Demand seriously outstripping supply.\n1972: The house which\nsold for \u00a3600 34\nyears ago, now\nfetches \u00a312,000.\nBy 1982, the price of\nthat same house is likely to be something in the\nregion of \u00a330,000. And\nby 1992? Well, shall we\nsuggest \u00a380,000?\nIf you think that ab-sur d, just look back at\nthe figures. What sold\nfor \u00a3600 in 1938, is today going for \u00a312,000.\nIn other words, its value\nhas increased twenty\ntimes in just over thirty\nyears.\n. . . AND PEOPLE\nAll right, so a lot of\nhouses have been, and\nare being built, but not\nnearly enough to accommodate you all\u2014that is,\nyou, who constitute part\nof that vast population\nexpansion. Furthermore,\nthere are other factors\nwhich help keep prices\nhigh. Monetary inflation\nand a shortage of land\nare only two of them.\nBut, in the end, it comes\ndown to people like your-selves, continuing to\ncome onto the housing\nmarket in massive num-be rs. And that's really\nwhere we started. The\nproblems we have outlined are the ones which\nyou are almost certain\nto face sometime in the\nnear future.\nHowever, it was not\nour intention to depress\nyou. Buying a house is a problem: it is a big one.\nBut problems can be\novercome, provided they\ncan be isolated and dealt\nwith properly. Which is\nwhat this series of\narticles is all about.\nIn our next column,\nwe shall deal with the\nbrighter side of the pic-ture. And there is a brighter side. People are\nstill managing to buy\nhouses within their income limits. Just what\nthose limits are, and are\nlikely to be; where to\nfind the money; how to\nbridge the gap between\nthe money you can borrow on a mortgage and\nthe price of the house\nyou want \u2014 all these\nproblems have answers.\nNext time, we'll suggest a few.\n\n"

Sir\u2014It is with some interest that I con the plan of the\nproposed Northside Hall\n\"Flatlet\" layout so thoughtfully provided by your staff.\nHowever, a ripple of disquiet disturbs the mill-pond\nof my mind, a hint of recognition. The source is this\u2014\nwhat is so special about the\nNorthside scheme that the\nstandard Weeks and Linstead Hall layout of eight\nbedrooms, two bogs, kitchen,\ncupboard and bathroom is\nsuddenly transformed into a \"Flatlet\"? The scheme is as\ngood as could be expected,\ngiven the limitations of finance and space, . . . but why\nshould it be eup hemis ed?I am. Sir, your euphemistically, ROB CARTER,\nWeeks Flatlet 2.\nCleaning up\nSouthside\nSir\u2014Further to the letter\nfrom Mr. Leachman with regard to the state of Linstead\ncar park: he may be interested to learn that City and\nGuilds' Motor Club has already been looking into this\nmatter. .\nOver the past few years,\nC6G MC has always taken\nan interest in the conditions\navailable for student car\nparking in college. This year\nthe club has tried to continue\nthe same interest.\nSeveral scrap cars have already been removed to the\nCouncil dump, with the full\napproval and co-operation of\nthe college security depart-ment, and the remainder of\nthe rubbish should follow\nvery soon.\nIn order to move these\ncars the Bo driver has usually kindly loaned Bo's trailer,\nbut of course if anyone has a suitable towing vehicle and\nwould care to help out, the\nclub would be very pleased\nto hear from them via the\nCBG Union Office.\nOne must also pause to\nrecall how this state of affairs\ncame about. If those who use\nthe car parks to do their repairs would have more consideration for others and especially for those who have\nto clear up the mess, then\nthis topic would never have\nbeen brought up.\nPerhaps these communications will make some people\nthink a little more.\nThank you for letting me\n\"Get it off my chest\".\nYours sincerely,\n\"THE GREEN\nSCREAMER\".\n(Name 8 address supplied).\nProtection:\nnot a racket?\nSir\u2014In one of your small\nadvertisements last week\n(Issue 316) it was stated\nthat car vandalism was rife\nat IC and that donations\nsent to Paul Hosking at the\nRag Office would prevent\nthis. I would like to clarify\nthe situation. Neither myself\nnor my committee are in\nany way concerned with the\nrunning of a protection rack-et, which is plainly inferred\nby the advertisement. (Yeah,\nbut does it contravene the\nTrades Description Act? \u2014\nEd.).\nAs I explained in my article\nin the last issue of \"Felix\"\n. . . (the writer here explains\nin great detail what he explained last week.\u2014Ed.).\nThere are 674,675 parking\nspaces at Imperial College\n(incorrect\u2014Ed.) which are\ngiven away free of charge\u2014\na donation of 25p or so for\na year's parking and also\nprotection of your vehicle\ndoes not seem expensive. So\nI would urge all owners of\ncars parked at IC to send\ntheir donations to the Union\nOffice: cheques should be\nmade payable to the Imperial\nCollege Carnival Charities\nAccount. Do not forget the\nnumber of your car: you will\nbe issued with a sticker to\nensure that your car is protected from the ravages of.\nvandals.\nMay I once again stress\nthat neither myself nor the\nrag committee are in any\nway connected with the running of a protection racket in\nIC. Our sole aim is to protect cars against vandals.\nYours sincerely,\nPAUL HOSKING.\nUnclear\nClarification\nSir\u2014/ am writing to you\nas in the future in the hope\nthat this letter will help to\nclarify the situation regarding the Return of the Landsnapper Sneeze.\nWhile the cartoon itself is\nonly likely to have a harmful effect on the few people\nwho have the intellectual\nprowess necessary to read in\nits present abridged form,\nthe real danger lies in the\n\"ramblings\" printed above it.\nAre these really ramblings\nor are they something more\nsinister? The main clue to\ntheir origin lies in the first\nsentence. You too may have\nnoticed that it starts at the\nbeginning. This fundamental\ndiscovery has far reaching\nconsequences (see Psychological Warfare and its application to Suspension\nBridges, Vol. MLXXII page\n12a dated September 31st1635) especially for the inhabitants of the Inner Asteroids. Unfortunately they are\nunable to make a full statement on the present economic situation without a more\ncomplete picture on which to\nbase their assessment.\nOne does not realise the\ntrue subversive nature of the\narticle until a few lines from\nthe end \" . . . including a plot\". The author has the\naudacity to admit to including a plot: planning permission for three bungalows and\nan oil refinery in a compact\narea of approximately\n.000539 acres.

When we issued our letter\nto all our members we did\nat no time order them to abstain from the elections. If,\nMr. Editor, you had read the\nletter you will see that we\nonly asked our members to\nconsider abstaining. We felt\nthat it had not been made\nclear enough to our members\nthat if they did not agree\nwith either candidate they\nwould do better to act positively by abstaining than by\nnot voting at all. After all if all\nthese members had not voted the results would have\nlooked far different and\nwould have been unrepresentative of ICU. Surely, Mr.\nEditor, if any of our members had formed a preference for either candidate\nthey would have voted for\nthem, regardless of our let-ter, so why should the CCU's be accused of what amounts\nto 'rigging' the elections?\nYou yourself stated that\nthere was 'a great increase in\nthe lack of comprehension of\nthe election procedure, since\na third of the electorate had\nonly three weeks experience\nof the College and Union'. So\nsurely, Mr. Editor, we were\nhelping to increase the comprehension of the procedure\nby making our members\naware of their right to ab-stain. You make it appear in\nFelix No. 316 that the CCU's were wholly responsible for\nthe continuing absence of a President for ICU but as\nshown in your own Felix poll\na large proportion ot ICU\nmembers were already going\nto abstain before our letter\nwas issued.\nCity 6 Guilds constitution\nSection 2\u20141 states that 'the\nobject of the union shall be\nthe furtherance of the . . .\nwelfare of the members'. We\ngenuinely feel that the letter\nwas for the welfare of our\nmembers, and that any accusations to the contrary are\ncompletely unfounded.\nFurther we would like to\nstate that at present the\nPresidents of the CCU's are\nworking with the remainder\nof ICU Executive to find a suitable candidate for ICU\nPresident. We hope that the\nnext election will yield just\nsuch a person.\nYours sincerely,\npp the members of\nCB GU\nM.G. NEWMAN\nG. HOPSON\nSociety\nStinks\nSir,\nI feel I must inform you\nthat there is no way out for\nhumanity. Stop producing\njunk, cars, consumer trash.\nSave resources, protect the\nenvironment.

Piers' grant ran out during the summer, and his policy\nhas been that as long as he can continue his studies at the College\nwithout paying his registration fees he will do so.\nPiers thwarted attempts\nby the Union executive to\nsilence him at the meeting\non the grounds that he\nwas not a member of the\nUnion by revealing that he\nhad, that morning, bought\nlife membership.\nHe said that, if necessary, he would go and register with the college\u2014but\npointed out that the Union\nshould honour their election of May last, and accept him as a member of\nthe delegation regardless of\nthis.\nMartin Black had said\nthat Piers had pledged at\nthe May delegation ele c tion, that he would be a registered student at the\ntime of the conference.\nThe arguments were interrupted by Mike Doherty, Academic Affairs\nofficer, who proposed that\nthe Union should accept\nthe earlier election and let\nPiers go to the conference.\nThis motion was passed\nby a sizeable majority.\nVote of Confidence\nImmediately after this\n\"vote of confidence in\nPiers\" Martin Black resigned from the delegation,\nleaving 3 places to be\nfilled from the six candidates standing. The other\ntwo vacancies were caused\nby the non-return to college of Brenda Dilley, and\nthe lack of a President.\nThe delegation consists of\n4 delegates and 2 ob ser v ers: those already going\nwere Rob Armitage (Ex-tern al Affairs Officer), \u2014\nand Piers Corbyn.\nTop of the poll for the\nremaining places was Trevor Phillips, who will now\n(with Rob Armitage) be\none of the only 2 of our\ndelegation who have been\nto Conference before, followed Closely by C.

C,1st XI, with a much-changed side, produced their best performance\nwhen they defeated St. Edmund's Hall, Oxford by 3-1.\nRight from the start of the game I.C. press uri sed their\nopponents, contesting every ball and the IC midfield\nwere soon in control. However, it was St. Edmund's who put in the first good shot, which was well saved\nby Gerwyn Edwards, in the IC goal. However, the hard\nrunning of the IC forwards was soon rewarded when\nAlan Williams headed home after fifteen minutes of his\nfirst team debut. For the rest of the half, IC dominated\nthe field and were unlucky not to add to their score on\nseveral occasions.\nAfter the interval, IC continued to dictate play, with\nthe St. Edmund's midfield being completely subdued by\nJohn Kelly, Byron Smith and Mick McConvey. The\nopposition's defence never really found an answer to\nthe quick thinking Imperial forwards, and the IC defenders had less and less to do as the game progressed.\nThe second goal came when Pete Lonnen converted a penalty, awarded for handball. Soon after this Ian Posthlewaite left the field with a badly bruised knee and\nPete Lonnen took over at centre-half. Barely five minutes later St. Edmund's also lost a player, this time with\na more serious ankle injury. IC were unaffected by the\nlong stoppage which this second injury caused, except\nthat is for Martin \"Gladys\" Manning and Pete Lonnen,\nwho each received a considerable amount of massage\nfrom certain Of the prettier spectators (you mean you\nhave spectators\u2014Ed.) and were never quite as interested in the game afterwards.\nIC's third goal came when Mick McConvey drove\nan awkwardly bouncing ball into the comer of the net\nfrom 15 yards. In the last minute, St. Edmund's grabbed a consolation goal when Gerwyn Edwards, who was\nby now quite cold due to a long spell of inaction, dropped a hard hit cross.\nTeam: G. Edwards, M. Manning, R. Kill, I. Bell,\nI. Posthlewaite, M. McConvey, B. Smith, J. Kelly, P. Lonnen, A. Williams, W. Milne.\nWhile the first team were finding things fairly easy,\nthe third XI were having to play well to survive against\nan unexpectedly strong Hertford College team. Outstanding in defence was Paul Hosking who was perhaps\nthe player most responsible for keeping the score at\n0-0 until the interval.\nIn the second half IC continued to hold out and\nHertford could rightly feel disappointed when, with\nonly a minute to go, Ian Hyslop snatched victory with\na20 yards drive.\nBack at Harlington, the 4th team cruised to a51 win against Royal Holloway College 2nd. To complete\na good day for the club, the 7th team won a well contested game against University College 7th s by 2-1.\nOn Wednesday, 1st November, IC played QEC at\nPetersham. Although IC won, the quality of football\nwas poor and apart from the fact that Byron (where's me-shorts) Smith scored after 15 seconds, there was little\nof merit in the team's performance. With 10 minutes to\ngo, IC were 3-0 up, then Gladys changed sides without\ntelling anyone, and the final score was 3-2.\nAt Shenley, the 2nd came back after conceding an\nunlucky goal to beat U.C.3 rds,31. Also at Shenley\nthe 3rds had a good 3-2 win over UC. 2nds. Playing at Harrington, the 4th s beat QEC 2nds52, and in an entertaining match the 5th s beat Royal Holloway 6-4. The 6th team with a suspect defence (just like\nthe 5th s!) beat RHC 3rds by 4\u20142. The only team to fail\nto win was the 7th s who lost 3-1 to the newly-formed\nQEC 3rd team.\nHockey\nAt last I. C.1st XI have shown they can play hockey;\nunder the renewed leadership of midfield general Dave\nRichman they held Southampton University to a0 \u20140\ndraw.\nSurprisingly, after good wins in the UAU, Soton took\na while to settle down; this seemed to give I.C. confidence, culminating in a fine move up the right that gave\nPete Foxton a chance to open the scoring, but he\nscrewed the shot wide of the left-hand post. However,\nmost of the first half was played between the 25's as\nboth sides generally cleared their lines very effectively.\nAfter the tactical murmur at half-time, I.C. had\ncomplete control of the opening period of the second\nhalf, but failed to convert this into goals although Mick\nDowns had a short comer cleared off the line.\nBut increasing Soton pressure ended in the award of\na penalty flick after a brilliant save by Rich Cameron\n\u2014 he might use his stick next time. Chris Steel had no\ntrouble saving the very weak flick. However, after Mick\nDowns had another short corner stopped on the line \u2014\nthe back used his feet this time \u2014 John Astley also\nmissed a penalty flick.\nTeam: STEEL; EVANS, HANSON, ROBINSON.\nCAMERON; RICHMAN, GAUKROGER; FOXTON,\nGAHIR, ASTLEY, DOWNS.\nOn Saturday, I.C.2 nd and 3rd XI's lost to weakened\nDulwich 2nd and 3rd XI's1 \u2014\n4 and 1\n\u2014\n3 respectively.\nChris Tyler scored for the 2nds, but the best goal in\nthis match was beautifully volleyed into the wrong net\nby 'Ron Palmer. Clive Thompson scored for the 3rd's after good work by Andrew Beal.\nThe Mixed XI went marching on with a1 \u2014\n0 win\nover Heston. \"Wonder-boy\" Richman got on the score-sheet but he managed to miss his usual quota of easy\nchances.\nOh yes, on Saturday, the 1st XI drew 1\n\u2014\n1 against\nU. C.M. in the Middlesex League Mick Downs actually\nscored from a short corner but his night-time activities\nknacker ed him so much that he was unable to write a report.\nBadminton\nIC 1st vs. CAMBRIDGE 1st Team : Dave Ward/Sooty\nChris Forkdodger/A. Shepherd\nRhod. Palmer/B. Slim\nWith ICfieldinga scratch team against the international studded Cambridge tea-tasting society, we played\nfor the draw. However, with Sooty in such fine form,\nDave Ward's indifferent play soon improved, showing\nus just why he is reserve for the IVth's, and they easily\nwiped out a2 \u20140 deficit so unluckily incurred in the\nsecond pair's game, when C. Forkdodger, in attempting\na very difficult shot (the lob), broke the head of his\nracket and his best pair of leg-irons. A. Shepherd came\nto the rescue and Chris played the rest of the match, on\nwheels. Bad luck too for Rhod and B in their first\ngame since being released. With Rhod playing in blinkers due to the amount of male thigh around, B's main\nproblem was watching for the long one down the\nmiddle. After the initial setback of two rapid defeats\nwe changed to what turned out to be the winning tactics\n\u2014 cheating. With more than an ample amount of laxative in the orange juice, CTTS tended to rush their shots\n\u2014 to their downfall. IC won 7\u20142.\nDave, Chris, Rhod, B then went on to play at singles\nR. Soalcs, P. Niss, Mike Hunt, Alf Hooker respectively.\nIC won 3\u20141.\n(Well, at least the scores are right).\nSailing\nMotor Racing\nOnce again, on Wednesday, 25th October, \"Team\nGuilds\" were out in act ipn. This time in their own\ntwelve-car rally entitled \"The Fresher Rally\". The purpose of this event was to introduce rallying techniques,\ntiming and navigational systems. Seven route-cards, each\nof a different type of problem for the navigator, described a route of about 100 miles through the narrow-winding country turnings of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves with\nonly one car having a minor argument with a tree\nstump which unfortunately ended their rally.\nCongratulations go to Jeremy Casson and Mark Coverly of Mech Eng 2, on winning the rally in their MiniCooper by a long lead. Messrs. House and Clemow\nshowed up all mechanics by changing a diff en route\nin 35 minutes. As is usual on Guild's excursions, good\nrelations with the Police were maintained with a friendly\nconstable stopping at a time-control and having a short\nchat with the organisers. Afinalword must be said for\nthose who ventured out to marshal and uphold that\nfamous name in the motor-sport world \u2014 \"Team\nGuilds\".\nKnobbly Knees\nOn 29th October, the team sailed a close match\nagainst Burton S.C. in National 12's. In the first race J. Scott soon took up the lead with all\nboats closely bunched. Simon Briscoe pulled through\nthe fleet after a bad start and eliminated one of the opposition on a port/starboard case only to be put out\nsoon afterwards trying to cut inside a boat at the gybe\nmark. We are now lying first and third against second\nand fourth. Their fourth boat was closing, on the run, on\nNigel Charlwood, in 3rd place but, as he tried to pass,\nhe was lu ffe d out and had to retire. Thus we finished\nfirst, third and retired against second, retired, retired:\na lead of 5J points.\nBy the time the second race started the wind was\nmuch stronger. We rounded the first mark, after a reaching start, in 1st,2 nd and 3rd places but, at the\nwindward mark, we had dropped badly to 1st,4 th and\n5th. Brian Rogers, now in first place, was never chal-leng ed, but Dave Law in 5th place was put out in alu ff ing incident leaving us 1st,4 th and retired against\n2nd,3 rd and 5th. On the run John Labard, in 4th place\nsuffered a gear breakage and had to retire. The race\nthus finished with the positions at the last mark, 1st,4 th, retired against 2nd,3 rd and 5th: that is 11| points\nagainst 10 points, a If pt deficit.\nThus, on aggregate, we won the match by 3^ points.\nThis was our second successive victory this term.\nWinner of the Mr. ICWA contest on Tuesday week.\nFELIX no 317.

(Oxford University Press). \u00a31.00.\nThis, so the cover notes say, is Mr. Porter's fifth collection of poetry. In it he expresses\ncontemporary views contrasted by the use of\nreferences to the art and sculpture of northern\nItaly; a slightly odd and dangerous thing to\nattempt, one might think, but overall the idea is a success.\nThe title of the collection in itself gives a clue\nto the subject matter and its treatment; the 'con-verte d' are the dead, and given that there arises\nconsiderable scope for original imagery related to\nthe timeless conflict between Man and Time. The\ndead are symbolised in the cold marble states que figures in European museums or the paintings of\nthe Masters. (The cover is a photograph of a Bernini work)\n'Preaching to the Converted is preaching\nTime,\nThe only subject that memorials hear';\nPerhaps the best place to begin in order to\nargue the case for this anthology is with the first\nfew lines of a particularly poignant poem called\n'In The Giving Vein' \u2014 an interesting piece by its\nmere form, since it consists of three sonnet-like\nstanzas (combining tradition with experiment)\nwhich gives an insight into the poetic method in\ngeneral and Mr. Porter in particular:\n'The evidence, like the weather, is from\nAn inner storm; the poem, like every poem\nWill be merely a beginning, . . .'\nAnd then (in the title poem again):\n'The Old is painted on an eye, he's Sleep,\nThe shadow of a never-noticed death.\nThe New is pictured on a box, he dreams\nOf Ever-Afternoon, Ego-Eternity:\nGreat Abstracts, which our thin vocabulary\nStrains to make real: and this is poetry'.\nFrom this small evidence one can already discern the morbid and sombre tone which pervades\nthe whole book . . . the search for Immortality,\n(Ego-Eternity), the conflicts between life and\ndeath, old and new, abstract and real, tradition\nand revolution.\n'God is a Super-Director\nwho's terribly good at crowd scenes,\nbut he has only one tense, the present.\nThink of pictures . . . ' he says\nand then finishing in the same poem with a further reminder that\n. . . 'God loves music\nand architecture, pain and palm trees,\nanything to get away from time'.\nThis theme recurs frequently, if not in the words,\nthen in the form of the poems which integrates\nEliotesque free verse and an over-large and esoteric seasoning of name-dropping (in several lan-gu ages, too, which isn't easy for us). But the\nrepetition is hardly noticeable in the boring sense;\nin fact it is one of the most tolerable collections\nof similar-theme poetry I have come across, just\nbecause the images seem so diverse within the\nframework he sets himself.\nIt's not all cadaverous as I 've made it sound,\nhowever. There are a few consciously lighthearted pieces dotted about, 'Sex And The Over\nForties' probably amongst the best, and if you\nlike to laugh at sexual imagery, there's plenty\nabout even if sometimes it does degenerate into\n(patronising?) slang expressions for anatomical\nparts . . . one is tempted to say pricks, genitals,\npump and suck, balls and pox out loud just for\nthe sheer thrill . . .\nOne particularly good couple of lines I cannot help but quote:\n'You set the alarm clock to remind us\nto do it before leaving for the office'\n. . . something you might identify with. But even\nthen at the end of 'Sex and the . . . \" there comes\nthe serious refrain:\n'Back to the dream in the garden,\nback to the pictures in the drawer,\nback to back, tonight and every night'.\nEither this, or superficially light aphorisms which\nslowly sink in:\n'I am the world's digestion, I am love,\nI eat and am eaten perpetually'.\nThe balance is completed by lines of hope like\n'. '. . stay with me my friends; truth and\nlove,\nlike miracles, need nowhere at all to happen\nin'.\nand\n'Wagner wrote 'Tristran' at forty-four . . . .'\nAdd to all this some succinct stanzas separated and given the apt general title of 'Postcard\nPoems' and the thing is complete. It is therefore\nwell worth a read if you're at all into poetry, but\nunless you're really keen not a rush-out-and-buy-it best seller, prices being what they are. I leave\nyou with this thought put into the mouth of\nSchopenhauer, which happily does not apply to\nthese poems . . .\n' Man is ridiculous; if\nit weren't for his death,\nhe'd have no value whatever. . .\"\nG.P. WENHAM.\nThe Reviews Page Discs\nSANTANA. \"CARAVANSERAI\" (CBS)\nOf all the praise that has been heaped on\nSantana in the three-and-a half year recording\ncareer, I don't ever remember their music being\ndescribed as progressive, even by writers who\ngive that description to any group who either concentrates on albums rather than singles and\nmakes their numbers last more than five minutes.\nSantana didn't in the past change their style from\nalbum to album\u2014it's only in the last week, when\nI 've been listening a lot to their first three albums\nas a \"prelude\" to this one, that I 've been able to\ndetect any difference in style between the tracks\non the first and third album.\nHowever, the term \"progressive\" will be applied to a Santana album for the first time in the\ncase of this one. Side one track one \"The Eternal\nCaravan of Reincarnation\" begins with the sound\nof crickets (or eez eet cicadas, mi amigo?); Pink\nFloyd were doing that years ago. Then an avant-garde sounding saxophone grunts a bit and a double bass and \"echo plex ed\" electric piano cut\nin and repeat a rather restricted riff for about\nthree minutes. Miles Davis gets in everywhere\nthese days. Bells jingle in the background just like\na caravan\u2014well, slightly. The best part of the\ntrack is the way it fades out of one speaker and\nthe next track \"Waves Within\" appears through\nthe other. The guitar is preceded by a peculiar\nsound, probably done with reverse tapes, but it\nhas a very pleasing effect. The rest of the track is\nrather disappointing after the superb intro, and\nwhen \"Look Up' 'begins in the same way with the\nstereo fade-out you begin to wonder if it is done\nstrictly for laughs. \"Look Up\" is also, disappoint-ingly, a second-hand Motown funk machine\neffect.\n\"Song of the Wind\" features a long guitar\nbreak from either Carlos Santana or Neil Schon\nwho I think is still with the band, and I think this\nis a mistake. The guitarist has an excellent technique but nothing new\u2014he would (and does)\ndo better in the shorter tracks, although I suppose you can always play it at 78. \"All the Love\nof the Universe\" reminds me of nothing so much\nas Yes. The slightly phased guitar and high-pitched vocal harmonies come straight out of\n\"Heat of the Sunrise\", but I'm sure it wasn't intended and the track is a nice climax to the first\nside. You certainly wouldn't mistake it for anything on \"Abraxas\".\n\"Future Primitive\" on Side Two has more electric piano, with lots of echo and some reverse\ntape guitar. (The future). Then in come the\ncongas and the shouting (The Primitive, pre sum ably) and they fade out once more leaving the\nFuture. Quite clever but not very satisfying\nmusically. \"Stone Flower\" begins in vintage Santana fashion with congas-bass-drums-organ-guitar and has a riff so familiar that it must have\nbeen written by Frank Zappa or Arthur Lee. \"La\nFuente del Ritmo\" is also typical of the group's old style and the speed and dexterity of it is quite\nfrightening\u2014try dancing to it and you'll give\nyourself a hernia. The tune isn't exactly classical\nbut this is my favourite track on the album at\npresent and I'm sure even the Mahavishnu\nOrchestra couldn't go faster.\nHaving heard \"El Fuente del Ritmo\" I'd find\nanything dull and \"Every Step of the Way\" is the\nunfortunate song in this case. It lasts over nine\nminutes but the meat of the track could have been\nplayed in a third of that time. It still snorts along\nat 847 times the speed of sound (after Santana,\neverything else moves backwards) so perhaps\nthat's unfair but the previous track'left me so\nstaggered that I couldn't take this one in.\nThe first three Santana albums took a long\ntime to grow on me, to the extent that listening\nto them pleased rather than impressed, and I think it'll be the same with \"Caravanserai\". I kept stopping the record to play a bit again:\n\"Did they really play that\" or \"What incredible\nproduction\". However, Santana fans won't be\ndisappointed. I should add that the total playing\ntime is over fifty minutes\u2014that's value.\nI think I liked \"Abraxas\" best . . .\nSID AMOR\nPaperbacks\nVENEREAL DISEASES by R.S. Morton\n(Pelican, 35p) Venereal diseases, all right\u2014that's no pro b lem: they can be cured now.\nUnhappily, however, venereal disease is on the\nincrease. Though some 250,000 people seek advice in Britain's special clinics every year, the\nnumbers infected are growing recognisably and\ngonorrhoea has recently been ranking second\namong the infectious diseases. In parts of Asia,\nAfrica and America the position is even worse.\nDr. Morton is aven e reo logi st and his book\nproduces a frank and sober study of syphilis,\ngonorrhoea and other diseases commonly transmitted during sexual intercourse. He treats his\nsubject without emotion and consequently without bias, his tools are the facts and figures, not\nthe yellow press's drive against pornography and\npermissiveness. He does however fill in the personal effects which may become so important to\na patient.\nWhen he discusses treatment this is not only\nviewed from the angle of curative and preventive\nmedicine, but also as an application of social\npolicy which must stem from the science of human behaviour. In the foreword, G.M. Carstairs\nwrites: \"This is a dispassionate study of a theme\nwhich has often aroused strong remedies . . .\":\nhe is very obviously correct. I suspect that this\nwill not be the book that most people are going to\nrush out and buy, but if you really want to find\nout what sexual diseases are and not just swallow\nwhat popular newspapers and magazines have to\noffer, then Dr. Morton is the man to read.\nFigures may often be distorted to tell the story\nthat you want; however, when 110,000 people\nwere treated for some form of venereal disease\nin the early 70's you begin to wonder. Dr. Morton\nleaves one with much food for thought, little\ncomfort for the sexual progressives and awkward\nproblems for the medical profession.\nDAVE HOBMAN\n\n"
