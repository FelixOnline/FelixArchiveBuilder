    "content": "ADDRESS BY THE RECTOR\nChairman, My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI must first express our sorrow at the deaths in\nrecent months of eminent colleagues who\nhave given service to scholarship, to the\nnation and to the College: Emeritus Professor\nGabor, Nobel Laureate, formerly Professor of\napplied electron physics; Emeritus Professor\nSir Ernst Chain, Nobel Laureate, formerly\nhead of the department of biochemistry;\nEmeritus Professor James, formerly head of\nthe department of botany; Emeritus\nProfessor Mitcheson, formerly head of the\ndepartment of hydraulics; and Robert Pryor,\nProfessor of Mining and head of the\ndepartment of mineral resources engineering. We mourn their deaths, but\nrejoice in their distinguished contributions to\nscience and engineering.\nLast year the Diploma of Associateship of\none of our three constituent Colleges was\nawarded to 881 students and the Diploma of\nMembership of IC bestowed upon 695\npostgraduates. We congratulate them all on\ntheir success and welcome their families and\nfriends who are here to join us in wishing\nthem well in their future careers. These will be\nfar more varied than many might imagine for\ngraduates of a College of Science and\nTechnology. For many years now, the\nMerchant Banks and other great institutions\nof the City have recognized the quality of an\nIC graduate. The electronics, mechanical\nengineering and computing industries as well\nas the scientific civil service have also been\nvery active in recruitment of our graduates\nthis year.\nBut despite this munificence of\nopportunities there remain some, as yet\nlargely unexplored, territories offering great\nchallenge. Our first lady Prime Minister, is\nalso that rarest of persons in the House of\nCommons, a science graduate. I hope that a few of you will follow her example and at\nsome stage in your careers desert your\nlaboratories, workshops and boardrooms for\npublic life and politics as members of other\nprofessions have long since done. Science\nand Technology can no more be kept at arm's length from central decision making than\nthey can be confined within rigid boundaries\nof departmental responsibility.\nNobody knows this better than my old\nfriend Sir Monty Finniston, our Special Visitor\ntoday, whose leadership and inspiration the\nengineering profession so greatly respects.\nHe will be pleased to know that among us\ntoday are our first graduates in Total\nTechnology. Their course has been designed\nto equip them to meet the present\nrequirements of a career in engineering in the\nnew Europe to which Britain now belongs.\nWe can no longer look doubt ingly over our\nshoulder with our backs to the Channel.\nAcceptance and understanding of our\nEuropean culture and of the role we have to\nplay within the European economy is an\nessential ingredient of higher education\ntoday. I am, therefore, very pleased to\nwelcome among our new Fellows, M. JeanJacques Baron, President of the National\nCouncil of French,Engineers. If our plans\nprosper, the education of our engineers will\nbecome much closer to that of their European\ncounterparts.\nThis can but give fresh emphasis to our\nlong-established tradition of welcoming\nlarge numbers of overseas students to\nImperial College. There are about a thousand\nof them altogether, and most of them are\npostgraduates under-taking advanced study\nand research. But now the government is\nproposing to charge full economic costs for\noverseas students. They are proposing fees\nwhich will be far higher than those charged\nanywhere else in the world.\nThat we should all be aware of the costs of\nthe services we enjoy is not in question. But I deeply regret that overseas students\nshould be singled out. This distasteful\ndiscrimination belies the moral authority\nwhich has for so long earned respect for\nBritain amongst the community of nations. It\nmakes our partnership in Europe much\nharder to achieve. It removes opportunities\nfor postgraduate work from poorer students\nof the Third World. It belittles the substantial\ncontributions these students make to our\nresearch. It impoverishes our society. It is\nwrong.\nI am glad in this context to report that the\nthat the President of the Students' Union and\nI have launched an appeal amongst staff and\nstudents so that we can award our own\nscholarship to a postgraduate from the Third\nWorld. The first award has been made this\nsession.\nIt is in this context also that I am delighted\nto report the recent award of Nobel Prize in\nPhysics to Professor Abdus Salam who\nbegan his career as an overseas student in\nCambridge. He has brought great distinction\nto Pakistan, to Britain and to IC. We are proud\nto offer him our warmest congratulations.\nThe swing eing increase in fees for overseas\nstudents is, of course, only one aspect of\ngovernment policies designed to cut-public\nexpenditure. I do not question the necessity\nto reduce expenditure. I do not protest that\nuniversities should be excluded from such\ncuts. I am concerned that we should all under\nstand what it means in realistic terms.\nIn a drought you have to channel the\navailable water to where it will do most good.\nSome crops must perish in order that others\nshall survive. You have to be selective.\nDuring the coming months we shall therefore\nbe looking most carefully at our courses, at\nour research activities, at our support\nservices, even at whole departments, to see\nwhether they should all continue. Unless we\nare selective there can be no vitality, no\ngrowth, nor even the maintenance of\nexcellence where as a College we have most\nto offer.\nThe Vice-Chancellor can be assured of my\nfull support in his endeavour to scrutinize in\nthe same way schools and departments of the\nUniversity of London as a whole.\nBut the main task of selectivity lies\nelsewhere. It lies with the government and\nwith the University Grants Committee. The\nfact is that there are a few too many\nuniversities in this country, and far too may\npolytechnics. Some of them must go in order\nthat others shall live. If IC is chosen to go, so\nbe it. Even that would be better than that we\nall sink into the morass of mediocrity.\nMr Chairman, I cannot conclude without\npaying a personal tribute to one of our new\nFellows. Mickey Davies has been a counsellor\nand friend to me since I was appointed\nRector. He is greatly missed by us all and it is\ndelight to have him with us again today\nlooking on from the outside at what he so\nlong ably commanded from within.\nTHE LORD FLOWERS, FRS\nADDRESS BY SIR MONTY FINNISTON, FRS\nIt was George Bernard Shaw who in the\nDoctor's Dilemma wrote, \"All professions are\nconspiracies against the laity\" - a..u no better\nproof of this utterance could be found than in\nmy presence on this rostrum. By a selection\nprocess of which even the political parties of\nthis country would be ashamed, the\nacademic profession seated on the platforms\nhas conspired together and by autocratic\ndecision by person or persons unidentified\ndetermined that I, a lay member of the\nestablishment temporarily invested with the\nflattering ti tlf e of 'Special Visitor', address you\non behalf of the Honorary Graduands any\none of whom as the public orations to which\nyou have listened will confirm, has more\nappropriate credentials than I. Graded grains\nit is said make finer flour, but in this case finer\nFlowers has graded brains.\nBy contrast, whatever you the laity may\nthink, the selection process by which your\nhonorary g radu and s have been awarded the\nFellowship or Associateship of this College,\nis one of which we the recipients all approve.\nWe would express our sincere thanks for\ngranting us this honour which, whatever may\nbe our private view, modesty forbids any\npublic suggestion by us that it is deserved.\nSome it has been said are born great, some\nachieve greatness and some have it pinned\non them. In whatever category you place us.\nwe are grateful.\nThe term 'Fellow' has fortunately been\nmodified in its usage through the ages from\nits attribution to a lower class servant,\npeasant or lout to the polished savant,\ntechnological peer or intellectual of\nacademic society; but in the Oxford\nDictionary 'Fellow' is defined inter alia as\n\"one of a company or corporation who, with\ntheir head, constitute a College and will\nreceive emoluments from the corporation\nrevenues\".

Any credibility\nstill left, must surely have floated\nout of the window now with the\nnews that ICU is fighting the\ngovernment. How spectacular a method. An occupation! Sit-in in\nthe senior dining room. What\ndisruption - what chaos! The\ngovernment trembles surely with\nsuch a convincing opposition, it\nmust fall. Yes, the government will\nbe brought to its knees by ICU's occupation.\nLike hell! The only lasting effect\nthis farce is going to have will be\nto make this college the laughing\nstock of the education system. If\nICU is going to protest at\nanything, then for Pete's sake -MAKE THEM SENSIBLE PROTESTS ones which actually\nstand a chance of working.\nYours sincerely,\nRJ Glass\nMech Eng 2\nDear Sir,\nApparently IC Radio announced\nin their news bulletin last week,\nthat Colin Palmer had not been\nproposed for the sabbatical post\nof FELIX editor. On Friday,\nOctober 12th, at 11:00am,I signed\nthe nomination papers as his\nproposer. I have several witnesses\nto this. Roger Stotesbury has\nverified that Colin had twenty\nsecond ers( not fifteen, as stated\non IC Radio).\nYours,\nJill Dawson\nDear Sir,\nLast year we voted for a balanced\nunion under Chris Fox. However,\nthe evidence of the last union\nmeeting suggests that we were\nbadly misled. At the time of the\nelection, Mr Fox made it quite\nclear, implicitly if not explicitly,\nthat the union should represent\nthe true wishes of the majority of\nstudents at IC.\nDoes Mr Fox really believe that\nthis majority wishes to be\nassociated with such a pointless\nand self-indicting action, as the\noccupation of the senior common\nroom.\nWhile agreeing with the general\nfeeling of the motion, we feel that\nthe action proposed can only\ndamage the reputation of IC and\ncan have no useful outcome.\nYours sincerely,\nD Cornwell and A Gardam\nMe ch Eng 2\nDear Colin,\nWe are disgusted! We were\nsitting in our flat on Saturday\nnight and we read about a concert\nin the concert hall, so we went.\nWe paid two pounds each for this 'pleasure', when we could have\ngone to any number of London\npubs to hear a far better band in a far better environment.\nWe respectfully suggest the\nsacking of IC ENTS committee or\na maximum price of seventy-five\npence for any concert in future.\nThis was a rip-off!\nYours sincerely,\nMike Speight/Jim Cantle\nChem Eng II\nDear Colin,\nAs a customer of the Nat West\nbank in college, for many years\nnow, I have noticed that if s getting\nincreasingly difficult to use this\nfacility without having to wait for\nexcessively long periods. Even\nthe introduction of the quick\nservice till and the mail box have\nfailed to improve the situation.\nThis is particularly noticeable on\nFriday afternoons and lunch-times, when it is exceedingly\ndifficult to get in the doors. I feel it\nis about time the bank's premises\nwere extended to cope with the\nincreasing demand.\nJS Whitehouse\n(Eds note: many people have\nagreed with Mr Whitehouse's comments.)\nDear Editor,\nI am writing to you concerning\nthe report on the U GM, which\nappeared in last week's FELIX. I shall not comment on the general\nquality of this report, but I am\nhowever, very concerned about\nthe paragraph, which referred to a heckler. The reason is, that I was\nin fact, the heckler mentioned,\nand I most certainly did not say or\nimply what was reported. I know a number of people did not hear all\nof what I actually said, so for the\nrecord, for those who did not hear\nthe full text of my statement, here\nit is: \"I wonder if the Irishmen who\nput bombs under cars would\nagree.\" I never used the word\nracism and certainly did not\nimply, that the troubles in Ireland,\ngive us the right to make fun of the\nIrish race. The reason why I in fact\nmade the statement in the first\nplace is that, to me, racial is m is\nindependent of the actual race in\nquestion, so an Irish joke is also\nracialist, like a joke about an\nIndian or a Jew. Therefore I could\nnot understand why the speakers\nseemed to accept the Irish jokes\nand not the other racialist and sick\njokes, that appear in this year's ICU Rag Mag. I did vote in favour\nof it being banned and feel the\nEditor, in the future should be\nanswerable to the Union Exec. As\nwhat he produces, will help to give\na good or bad name to IC\nstudents.\nI feel for too long, the British\nhave aimed a large proportion of\ntheir jokes at the Irish and if this\nstopped, perhaps it could help\nremove the anti-British attitude,\nthat occurs in some Irish people,\nboth inside and outside Ireland.\nThen, with a bit more understanding between both peoples,\nthe tragic troubles in Northern\nIreland could be solved, much\nearlier than seems likely at\npresent.\nI apologize to anybody who\nmight have misunderstood the\npart of my statement they heard\nand been offended by it. I will, in\nfuture, keep\"my mouth shut and I hope that FELIX reports, contain\nonly accurate and not misleading\nsections, as this one failed to do.\nYours sincerely,\nIan Prosser\nChem Eng 3\nDear Colin,\nRe the letter by JC Pearson on\nforeign student's fees (sorry to\nlabour the point, but....). Guys\nwith ideas like Pearsons are the\nmost depressing thing about IC.\nTake the first paragraph, he\nmakes it quite clear from the start\nthat his first concern is himself\nand that \"matters of direct\nconcern to students\" are the only\nones worth worrying about. It\nseems to me that many, if not most\nIC students seem to care about\nlittle more than the size of their\ngrants, because this directly\naffects the amount of beer they\ncan pour down their alimentary\ncanals on pub crawls and pub\nnights. Most rag stunts are\nglorified open air parties where\nsundry idiots can pratt about to\ntheir hearts content, and , except\nfor a few great guys who reason,\nthe students who go on the four-legged races etc., see the raising\nof money as a side issue of little\nconcern to them.\nI cannot comment on the 'facts'\nabout student fees, as most\nsources seem to be out to bend\nthem to suit their point of view.\nBut talking on issues only:\ncompare the few millions spent\non or gained from for ie gn students with the thousands of\nmillions spent on foreign aid, so is\noverseas aid wrong?\nHow many people recently have\nsaid in one sentence what a shame it is that the people of\nZimbabwe and many other third\nworld countries cannot run their\nown societies due to lack of\neducation, and in the next\ndenounce the supposed financing\nof overseas students.\nAnd lastly Mr Pearson say's that\nthis all comes out of taxpayer's money, but I don't see too many\ntaxpayers dying of malnutrition or\nsleeping twelve and thirteen to a one room shack. Come on,\ncollege is not an ivory tower, nor is\nBritain for that matter. Third\nWorld future is our future. Let's see more overseas aid, more\noverseas students, but most of all\nmore ACTION. John Waterworth\nPhysics 1\nDear Colin,\nRe Mr Pearson's letter about the\nstudent fees. I would like to point\nout that there are two views\nregarding this point: the governments and that of\nUK COSA and NUS. Mr Pearson's view is based on the government's view of the 'full economic cost'.\nThe view taken \u2022 by NUS and\nUK COSA is that overseas students shu ld be charged marginal costs. This is based on\nthe concept that the education\nsystem is designed for the home\nstudents and that the overseas\nelement represents extra students\n'on the margin' and it is logical to\nuse marginal rather than average\ncosting in the fees analysis.\nAccording to this, overseas\nstudents bring in \u00a350million per\nyear to subsidize the British\neconomy.\nI think it is about time the two\nopposing parties got together and\ndecided what the full economic\nimplications are for housing\noverseas students in Britain.\nAt the moment universities'\ngrants are going to be cut in direct\nproportion to the number of\noverseas students that they take\nin, thus forcing universities to\ncharge the 'full economic cost'.\nThis would lead to a drastic\nreduction in the number of\noverseas students (and govern-ment s) who would be able to\nafford these fee levels (\u00a32,350 per\nstudent).\nYours sincerely,\nM Fernando\nDear Colin,\nHaving seen an approximately\n4\"x4\" photograph of Professor\nAbdus Salam, semi-pasted onto\nyour prototype cover last week\n(two days before printing), I was\ndisappointed, nay disgusted to\nfind that only the four and a half\nline article appeared on the final\nprint.\nI sincerely believe that the great\nachievement of an IC professor\nbeing awarded the Nobel Prize for\nPhysics, should have been given\nmore coverage in what is, after all,\nIC's most widely read publication.\nWith two pages of letters and a large advert for IC's 'news\nservice', I am sure that alternative\nspace for the eventual bottom-right corner article could have\nbeen found.\nYours, until I unify the strong\nnuclear force with gravity,\nPeter Hewkin\nEd - A Press release, from\nStockholm, arrived after we had\ngone to press.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "ICU OSC TUITION CUTS: THE FACTS\nFEES ISSUE\nIn 1977-78 tuition tees tor overseas\nstudents were raised by 60%. Figures ranging\nIrom \u00a3 tOO million to \u00a3120million were quoted\nas annual resource costs of overseas\nstudents. Though these figures have been\nquoted frequently there is no apparent\nagreement as to how they were arrived at.\nHowever on the basis of the available figures\nthe arithmetic could be: total gross cost of\noverseas students to education budget\u00a3153million less overseas students' fees\u00a330million which leaves a cost of \u00a3123million on 1976-77\n'\"gur es.A report undertaken by NUS and UK COSA used marginal costs as the logical starting\npoint rather than gross costs. The basis for\nthis is the premise of the DES that the UK\neducational system is primarily for home\nstudents and that the overseas students\nrepresent extra students 'on the margin'.\nThey also considered the benefits which\nmight reasonably be deducted to produce e fairer net figure; benefits such as research\ninput, long-term trade benefits and foreign\nexchange brought in by the students, none of\nwhich were considered in the government's calculations. There are other un quantifiable benefits, such as cultural and educational\nadvantages derived from their presence,\nwhich are neither unimportant or\ninsignificant. Using monetary arguments,\nthis report refutes the assertion that overseas\nstudents are 'subsidized'.\nThere are some who hold the view that\neducation is a commodity and it should be\ncharged according to what the market would\nstand. If this view is to be put forward then it\nshould be done bluntly and honestly, not\ncamouflaged or rationalized by baring the\ndiscussion of overseas students fees on a supposed subsidy. The principles behind the\n'market-value' argument are different but\nequally reprehensible.\nLord Ashby wrote: \"At universities fees for\noverseas students are much higher than\nthose for British students - a deplorable\npolicy, a sorT of intellectual import control.\"\nPratt, Travers and Burgess have written in\n'Costs and Control in Further Education':\n' The DES has been simply, visibly and always\nwrong.\" Their policies towards overseas\nstudents is another example of this.\nThe government recently increased tuition\nfees by 33% in 1979-60, adding to the\nimbalance, claiming that 'at least 60% on\naverage of the total cost on tuition will still be\nmet from public funds.' Until the government\nacknowledges the marginal cost concept and\nbenefits of overseas students as recipients of\nsubsidies whereas all the evidence suggests\nthat overseas students are a benefit to the UK\neven on monetary terms.\nMore recently and worrying ly. the UGC sent a letter to the Vice-chancellors of\nUniversities stating that it is the government's intention to move towards a position in which\noverseas students meet the full cost of their\neducation and to reflect this in the UGC grant\nwith respect to overseas students admitted in\n1980-61 and subsequent years. For example,\nthe UGC grant for IC, in clu di hg all fees, is\n\u00a322.37millions at present and for the next\nthree years the grant decreases from\n\u00a320.34million( in 1980-81) to\u00a317.29million in\n1982-83, which includes fees for time\nstudents and overseas students starting their\ncourses before 1980-81. In 1983-84 it will be\nthe same figure and this will include no fees\nfor overseas students, ie, they will pay the 'full\neconomic cost'.\nThe committee of Vice-chancellors and\nprincipals reacted quickly and strongly to this\ncriticising the govern met for threatening the\nfinancial future of universit es whose finances\nare already in a state of grave uncertainty'. Sir\nAlec Morrison. Chairman of the CVC P. said\nthat the government proposed to remove a substantial part of our income under the\nfallacious belief that it corresponds to the\n'subsidy' to overseas students, leaving\nuniversities to recoup whatever they can by\ncharging the so-called 'economic fees' which\nwould have to be at a level far in excess of\nanything charged to students anywhere else\nin the world. In the opinion of the CVC P. the\neffect of these policies would be potentially\ndisastrous and undermine institutions which\nare vital national assets. The committee also\nrequested the Secretary of State for\nEducation and Science to think again.\nIf the fees are raised to the cost suggested\nby the government, there will be a drastic\ndrop in numbers of overseas students in this\ncountry as they will go to other countries,\nsuch as America or decide to stay at home.\nOnly the very rich people or governments will\nbe able to afford the full economic cost. This\nwould be rather a pity as overseas students\ntake an active part in academic and solid\nactivities and provide a valuable glimpse of\ntheir cultures. Only by living together wit l we\nbe able to solve the problems which face us\ntoday.\nQuoting from the London conference on\noverseas students report: \"Universities have\nalways been international communities of\nscholars; academic freedom has meant\nfreedom to share knowledge and ideas as if\nnational frontiers did not exist If\ngovernments and educational authorities\ngenerally accepted such a philosophy today\nsuch a paper would be superfluous and\nirrelevant\".\nAt tab Gujral\n1. A reduction in rate support grant of\n\u00a3300million approximately, 50% of which is in\nthe education sector. The total amount spent\nby local authorities on education is about\n\u00a36.500m' 'lion.\n2. A reduction in * central government\nexpenditure of \u00a355million, of which \u00a38million is in the university sector.\n3. The dropping of the pilot scheme to\nintroduce mandatory awards for 16-19 year\nolds and the loss of many discretion at y awards.\n4. A cut in the nursery sc nool education from\n\u00a35.9million to \u00a34million.5. The increase in school meals by 5p to 30p.6. The reduction in the youth opportunities\nprogramme by \u00a328million.( These cuts were announced in the budget;\nthe details may, be found in the DES press\nnotice (12th June, 1979).\nThese cuts are only the beginning of a long\nprogramme by the government. The Secretary of State for Education and Science\nhas said that local authorities should be\nprepared for at least a further 5% cut in rate\nsupport grant in 1960-81 and a possible'\n71/2% cut which would mean:\ni. A loss of 70,000 teaching staff.\nii. Cuts in books and materials etc.\niii. Changes in statutory regulations in\nschools.\niv. Changes in grants.\nThe RS G affects schools, polytechnics and\ninstitutes of higher education and the\nproposed cutbacks will affect the latter two\nitems regarding reduced intakes, possible\nclosure of under subscribed courses and a reduction in overseas student numbers.\nDiscretionary awards will also be badly\naffected in that LEAs do not have to pay them\nand as such will be cut back immediately. The\nauthorities cannot offset losses by raising\nrates as the government has stated that it will\ntake action against the authorities who do\nraise rates, etc.\nThe reduction in nursery school education\nis important as many parents going to postsecondary education and leaving a child at\nthe nursery may not now be able to do so,\nthus causing further disc r imation and\nhardship.\nIn the university sector, the UGC have\npropose a6% decrease in home student\nintake in 1980-81 from the present figures.\nProspective entry for October 1980 was to\nincrease above that of October 1979 from\n78.000 to 79.000 A6% reduction would leave\nintake in 1980 at 73,320 which is actually\n92.8% of the expected intake for that year.\nTotal university student population would\nonly decrease by 1.89%. However, in order to\npreserve present standards a decrease of less\nthan 1.69% would be necessary in grant\nallocation as many of the costs remain static\n'eg 1.89% of a Rector cannot be removed).\nThus marginal costs must be used. The UGC and CVC P calculate the short-term marginal\ncost at about 50% of average costs, ie 5 x1.89% equalling .95%. The smallest cut\nconsidered by the UGC in recurrent grant is\n21/2%. This would require a5% reduction in\ntotal university student numbers to maintain\nstandards, ie 1980-81 intake would be 80.7%\nof 1979-80 intake.\nHowever from the UGC letter (15th October, 1979) it appears that overseas\nstudents beginning courses from 1980-81\nonwards will be asked to pay the 'full\neconomic cost' and by 1983-84 the UGC grant will only cover home students.\nIn reply to this the CVC P have stated that\nthey are disturbed that the recurrent grant\nwill be held constant in real terms over the _\nnext four years less approximately 13% which\nis regarded as the cost of overseas students.\nHome-student numbers are projected to\nincrease in the n^ xt few years and the 13%\nlost due to overseas students may not be\nrecovered at all for recurrent grant to stay\nconstant in real money terms, it will be\nimpossible to continue to provide an\nopportunity to qualified school-leave rs to\nenter into university education. Inflation and\nprices are not considered.\nThe nation's future depends on these\nstudents and to hinder their education in this\nmanner can only hinder the nation's development. The contribution of research to\nthe nation is vitally important especially in\nmedical, scientific and technological areas\nand reduction in research grants in particular\nand in the university sector as a whole can\nonly do serious damage to the country in the\nfuture.\nMany have said that the cuts are nec es sar/, but the government was elected to cut waste\nin all public areas, ie \u00a360million to help bright\npupils into assisted places in independant\nschools and \u00a3200million increase in the\ndefence budget, it is necessary to ask if these\nexpenditures are essential.\nSo the occupation has ended on\nCommemoration Day, but that does not mean\nthat everyone goes away and thinks that it is\nall over and that they have done their bit,\nbecause this is not the case. The occupation\nhas only provided a springboard from which\nto start an educated college-wide campaign\nagainst the cuts in education. It is necessary\nto continue with more action, eg writing to\nMPs, lobbying MPs, taking part in the week of\naction in November. The next major step is to\norganize that campaign effectively. This will\nbegin at the open meeting on Wednesday,\n31st October at 1pm in the Union. Do you\ncare about the future of the education system\nin this country?\nJOHN PASSMORE OCCUPATION ENDS\nThe Occupation of the Senior\nDining Room ended at 12:15 on\nCommemoration Day.

    "content": "considerable stringency for universities and\ncolleges should relieve you even more, is that\nthey wish to forego their rights to receive\nemoluments from the College. To be\nhonoured and be paid for the honour would\nbe too. much to expect even of a welfare\nsociety!\nIt is a feature of age that whereas the young\nknow everything about little, the more elderly\nrecognize the limitations of their own\nexperience and know little about anything. In\naddressing this audience, therefore, I start\nwith the disadvantage that I do not know what\nto say which would be helpful and if I had\nwords of wisdom to impart whether they\nwould make any impression. Winston\nChurchill, who suffered on neither count,\nonce said that in making any public speech\nthe speaker should concentrate on making\none point only, since this desirably curtailed\nthe length of the speech and at any rate was\nas much as one could expect one human\nbeing to assimilate from another human\nbeing I would like to make two half-points.\nThe first relates to the economic future of\nthis country, a future which is already with us\nand in the hands and minds of those who\nthrough devotion to study during the past few\nyears have gained their first or perhaps in\ncertain cases second degree by examination.\nIt is commonplace to hear that this world of\nchange through political upheaval, but\npolitical revolutions only replace chaos with\nconfusion. The major revolutions of this\ncentury, in Russia, China, Cuba, Iran or\nwherever, and even the demise of an empire\nwhich fathered this College, have affected\nfewer people directly and indirectly and in\nlesser degree than the continuing revolution\nof technology in the same period. The\ndescription of this College - 'Science and\nTechnology' - defines the disciplines from\nwhich change emerges in the modern world.\nEven those who accept the regimes of\npolitical revolutions are only offered as\nrecompense the fruits and benefits of the\ntechnological revolution for which you and\nothers like you will be responsible.\nThe technological revolution which we are\nnow experiencing is, however, of a different\norder of magnitude and kind from those\nchanges which have preceded it. Whereas the\nIndustrial Revolution replaced the brawn of\nman by the power of the machine, today's revolution through the transistor in the\nmicroprocessor and computer is\ntransferring some of the intellectual qualities\nof the human being to the machine. If God made man in His image, man is making the\nrobot in his own. Many look upon this\ncreating conditions fearful to man and his\nwork. This is not my view nor is it in fact the\nlesson of historical experience. The opportunities to relieve man of the burden of\nwork at its worst - the dull, repetitive,\nmindless activities of routine - are a consequence of new technology. Who would\nbuild satanic mills today? Who would\ncondone the inhumanity of the technologies\nof yesteryear? If assembly lines can be left to\nrobots why use human beings? The\ntechnology of the future is about freeing the\nindividual not just to control the environment\nin which he lives, but to engage in pursuits\nmore satisfying to himself and for others.\nIo wever, as a nation we have failed, in\nhuman and technical terms, adequately to\ntranslate into the industrial world the basic\nknowledge and skills emerging from this\nCollege and other places of change; not may I hasten to add because the talent is lacking\nbut because the cultural environment does\nnot encourage our single national asset -educated manpower. Since it is the world of\ntechnological change which maintains us in\nthe style of living to which we have become\naccustomed and which holds out future\nexpectations of the better life - physically less\narduous, aesthetically more pleasing, intellectually more satisfying - what is to be\ndone to correct the present inertia?\nMany years ago, Heine, the German poet,\nwas asked, \"If the world were to come to an\nend where would you like to be?\" and he\nreplied, \"In England\" and when asked why, he\nsaid, \"Because England is always one\nhundred years behind the times.\" Sir, the\nriposte is not true. The gap between us and\nthe rest of the world in standards of living can\nbe bridged by encouragement of the present\ngeneration, but we have to adopt and act\nupon two words essential to the conduct of a modern industrial society; two words we have\nto borrow from other countries because we\nhave no English equivalent (nor for that\nmatter a Scottish one). The first is from the\nFrench - entrepreneur - and the second the\nGerman word 'Technik' defined as the\nsynthesis of knowledge from many disciplines to devise technical and economic\nsolutions to practical problems. In adopting\nboth as part of the culture of our society\ndefined as the beliefs, knowledge and\ntechnology deriving from man's activities and\ncolouring our way of life, lies our material\nsalvation and the response to Heine.\nBy the turn of the century, most of the\ngraduates sitting in this hall will have married\nand have had families, or by judging by\npresent conditions will at least have families.\nThe world in which their children will be living\nwill be different from the one in which the\npresent cohort of graduates seek to progress\ntheir careers, even to the examinations which\nin the year 2000 may well be beyond the\ncomprehension of you graduating today.\nWhich brings me to my second half-point -what kind of society will it be.\nYour Honorary Graduands are of an age\nwhere their contributions to the material\nprogress of society through technology is\nmainly of the past. They would acknowledge\nwith considerable satisfaction and certainly\nconfidence that the talent and character of\nthose newly graduated today to progress\ntechnology will move certainly farther and\nprobably faster than in the past. But when\nyour Honorary Graduands consider the\nstructure and behaviour of society in which\nthese new developments will be assimilated,\nthere is concern and doubt. Society has to\noperate on assumptions of values which are\nnot based on natural phenomena subject to\nexperiment or control in the laboratory. We\nknow the techniques science, technology\nand even industry use to advance themselves\nbut the conduct of society cannot be so\nregularized or regular a ted. The criteria by\nwhich society conducts its relationships\nbetween people whether in the family, in the\ncommunity, at national or international level,\nare based on the concept of order; order\nimplies rules and rules imply values which\nhave to be assumed and tested by\nunstructured experience for their worth.\nThe concepts of science and the\ndevelopments deriving therefrom have\nquestioned some of the recognized values of\nthe past which were based mainly upon\nreligious (or humanist) tenets. Organized\nreligions have lost ground and their tenets\nhave been neglected. Yet it is interesting to\nconsider the chaos which would result if\nthese tenets were rejected or given lesser\nplace in society. A good test of any scientific\ntheory is to determine the implications of\nopposed assumptions. On this test, it would\nbe an odd world if the Ten Commandments\nwere reversed; a sixty hour week instead of\nforty. (Mr Terence Duffy would certainly ask\nfor a return at least to the 4th commandment);\nand what would happen if murder, stealing or\nremoval of sexual restraint of the 6th,7 th and\n8th commandments respectively were the\nnorm?\nBut one asks then, are these values of\nthemselves sufficient or do we need in\npresent society additional values which could\nbe neglected in the past but now have to be\naccommodated in the new world of\ntechnology. Has the changing world to adopt\nnew and additional values not just to the\npresent generation but to future generations?\nCan waste of natural resources for example,\nbe condoned? Where do we look for answers\nto these and similar questions?\nOne obvious place is a university because\nhere is a centre for freedom of thought and\nexpression; it is also the cradle for value\ndetermination because those who attend\nuniversity are in the transition between\ntutelage of the school and the assumption of\nindependence and responsibility of the\ncitizen to come. Attention to the conduct of\nthe society in which you will be living and\nleading is not a first priority one at least which\ncannot be neglected. The American author\nOliver Wendell-Holmes once wrote, \" Our system of morality is a body of imperfect\nsocial generalisations expressed in terms of\nemotion.\" I believe a university or college\noffers not just the prospect of material\nprogress by mankind through the exercise of\nreason not emotion, but the development of a system of values which can also be subject to\nthe exercise of reason and not emotion. Brute\nforce, mob power and self-interest are not the\nweapons of a society in which education and\nintelligence set the standards, and nowhere\nare these weapons less in evidence than in\nthe atmosphere of a college catering to\nlearning youth. We Honorary Graduands\ntherefore offer you Associates and Diplomates our best wishes in the creation of\nan improved world based upon the\nknowledge and as important the values which\nthis College has afforded you - and hopefully\nyou have accepted.\nDo YOU care about\nthe future of the\neducation system in\nthis country?\nCome to an open\nmeeting at 1PM on\nWEDNESDAY, 31ST OCTOBER.\nContact the Union\nOffice for the location\nof the meeting.\n11\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nBY CHRIS WATTS\nDAVID WERNER\n(EPIC)\nOnce upon a time, in the mid-seventies, in\nthe days of the dinosaur rock bands, there\nlived and gigged a band called the New York\nDolls, who used to dress up in ladies clothing\nand go on stage and play heavy rock. They\nweren't very good.\nHowever, there is a happy ending to this\nstory. David Werner was one young\ngentleman that used to play in the aforementioned outfit (sic), and has now produced\na solo album, which is probably the best that\nI 've heard since March of this year. \" Ah,\"I hear you say, \"it's all very well extolling the\nvirtues of this masterpiece, but how do you\nclassify the music?\" Well it seems that you\ncan't classify it, Werner appears to have\nignored all trends towards disco or punk,\nneither has he grabbed onto the recent\nrespectability of 'pop', but produces songs\nthat could have been laid down on a forgotten\nrecord by David Bowie in his 'Man who Sold\nthe World/Ziggy Stardust' era, an almost\nuncanny example of this is 'Every New\nRomance', which was mixed by lan Hunter.\nThe LP opens with a very fast track, 'Can't Imagine', which is almost like a Motorhead\nsingle in its speed, but totally superior in k the resolution between each distinct chord from\nthe lead guitar, but leaving the emphasis on\nthe drumming, care of Tom Monney (no\nrelation).\nThis is followed by a couple of songs that\nsound as though they were at least produced\nby Bowie, five or six years ago, although all\nthe material was written by Werner himself.\nPerhaps the strongest feature of the album\nis the immense variety of style, ranging from\nKinks softies to heavy metal, with an\nexceptionally competent band the music\ndoes not need to rely on one particular\nplayer/instrument to carry the songs\nthrough, for instance on 'Every New\nRomance' the vocals and bass are all that are\nrecalled, whereas on 'Eye to Eye' the slicing\nlead guitar is all that is remembered. Mark\nDoyle plays it like he could have had tuition\nfrom Pete Townsend.\nUnfortunately for Mr Werner, I don't think\nthat there is a track from the record that is\nvery suitable to turn into a single, and without\nthe air play, that a single would bring, nobody\nis going to buy the album. Better luck next\ntime.\nDREAM POLICE\n- CHEAP TRICK (EPIC)\nCheap Trick have found a successful\nformula for selling their records, consequently this album sounds irritatingly\nlike their last studio album.\nThe band have been going for some time\nnow. Tom Peterson and Rick Nielson started\ntogether in the late sixties then split the band\nto play with Tom Mooney and Stewkey, the\nremnants of Nazz after Todd Rundgren gave\nupon them to go solo; then after another split\nthe present line-up got together in the early\nseventies and have been doing the rounds in\nthe US for five or six years.\nSince then they have cracked all the\nsingle/album charts necessary to make big\nmoney, and I expect that they'll do it again\nwith this offering as it sounds an equally\nuni spire d, heavy-metal rip-off as the last.\nBut onto the good points. The eighteen\nmonths old promotional blurb that came with\nthe album held that, as far as I could translate,\nthe great strength of the music must be the\ngreat inventiveness and variety of chords\ncoming from Tom Peterson's bass. If you\nwant imaginative bass playing then buy a Status Quo record instead of this.\nAs for Zander's \"amazing voice\", it sounds\non 'Need Your Love' like Donna Summer's'I Need Love' single played at 33 1/3rpm and I'd agree that \"it's a just indication of what an ace\nrock singer he is\". (Quotes in the above\nparagraph are from the promotional text).\nProbably the best thing about this album is\nthat it is not even catchy. My copy is up for\ngrabs\nLASER LOVE\n- AFTER THE FIRE\n(CBS)\nNow we come to After the Fire and their first\nlong player, which is quite a relief after having\nlistened to Cheap Trick three or four times.\nYou've heard the singles, they came to IC last\nyear so most of you have had the chance to\nsee them live.\nThe album is very much like the singles in\nthat it is professionally played, catchy and\nrevolves around the keyboards. The whole\nalbum is eminently suitable for airplay from\nthat great network in the sky, Radio One as it\nis well played, well produced and contains\nneat 'pop' tunes. However, the material from\nwhich the songs are fabricated just does not\ncome up to scratch. Although producer, Muff\nWinwood (who,in part, was responsible for\nthe phenomenal success of Dire Straits) has\nmade the best of mediocre material. Although\nfun and bouncy, every song sounds as\nthough it was meant to be a single, which is\nno bad thing( remember'Parallel Lines'?), but\njust did not come up to scratch and so got laid\ndown as an album track.\nBut apart from anything else the single\n'One Rule for You' is included on the album,\nwhich must be a bonus for the LP. If you like\nkeyboard music then you will probably enjoy\nthis record immensely, as most of the songs\nrevolve around the keyboard player, Peter\n'Memory' Banks, who is a highly proficient\nplayer.\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THIS KEEN TO GO ON\nA GARDEN PUB CRAWL\n(PLEASE) CONGREGATE IN THE UNION BAR\n6:30pm7:30 pm on FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n(TONIGHT)\nALL THOSE PRESENT AND PAST MEMBERS OF\nTHE HALL WELCOME ,\n(TIES TO BE WORN IF POSSIBLE)\nSihra Self-Mind Control\nteach e* you to\nTake Control\nof\nYour Life\nWe are the oldest and largest mind training system in the world, having successfully taught hundreds of thousands of people to be more effective in life.\n\u00bb RELAXATION AT WILL* SPEED LEARNING* POSITIVE THINKING:* MEMORY IMPROVEMENT* SELF CONFIDENCE* SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS* PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT Free Lectures\n8 pm8 pm Fri\nMo:;\n2 6 th29 th Oct\nOct\n3 & 8 pm Tue s30 th Oct Caxton Hall.S W1 Kensington Town Hall.

    "content": "GOVERNMENT RESIGNS AS UNIVERSITY HALLS OF RESIDENCE OCCUPIED BY REVOLTING STUDENTS by Fanshaw F Love, Head of our Student Affairs Team (^J^\"\"\"^ Today, a world disaster has been averted at\nthe campus of the University of Reddon, near\nJekyll Park in London. Although to the\nuntrained eye, it would appear that nothing\nhas happened; I'm sure that today's momentous events will be inscribed in the\nannals of history. Squashed inside a dug-out\nwith twenty-seven other journalists, I 've\nwatched the unfolding of these events. Let me\ntry to recap them.\nIt all began when the College authorities\nissued a statement claiming that the student's Union had instigated an occupation of the\nHalls of Residence, without their sanction.\nThis was the culmination of two months of\nspeculation, rumour, accusation and\nrebuttal. When I first questioned Miss Foxy\nLady, the student President, about the\noccupation, she denied all knowledge of it.\nClearly, this was extremely subtle diplomacy.\nWhen I urged her to reveal the motives for the\noccupation, she pondered for a while, then,\nalmost as if she was making them up on the\nspur of the moment, told me there were\nthree....at least. The protest was directed\nagainst rising tuition fees, cuts in government\nspending and last, but not least, Soviet\npresence in Mongolia, she said.\nIt's been exceptionally difficult to tell fact\nfrom fiction as all sorts of extraordinary\nrumours have buzzed around the excited\ncampus. It has been estimated that a total of\nsix hundred students, and revolting students\nat that, participated in. the occupation,\nalthough some sources have put the figure as\nhigh as fourteen thousand. This last figure is\nhighly questionable since there are only two\nthousand students in the entire university.\nStrangely enough, most, if not all, of the\nstudents that I 've interviewed today, have\nalso denied the existence of any occupation.\nThis is generally believed to be a tactical\nmanoeuvre on the part of the Union.\nAll the same, the atmosphere here has been\nthick with tension all day. Though nothing\n'revolutionary' has happened, we confidently\nexpected the insurrection to occur at any\nmoment. I was anonymously informed that\nprominent members of the College authorities have been reading the riot act to\neach other in fearful anticipation ofthe events\nto come. This morning I spoke to Don\nGiovanni, the Dean and famous opera, who\nwas terribly anxious because the students\nhad made no further move. Their inactivity,\nhe added, was ominous. Indeed, he said that\nwhat worried him most was that he'd no idea\nhow long the occupation had been going on\nfor.\nSomething portentous did happen at about\nmidday when Miss Foxy Lady left her\npresidential offices and walked over to the\nladies' toilet. What did it mean, we wondered?\nWas this the prearranged signal? It turned out\nto be a false alarm, thank God.\nMeanwhile, the news of the occupation\nspread to the four corners of the globe and we\nbegan to hear the reactions of the Heads of\nState of the leading nations of the world. The\ngovernment of Greenland was one of the first\nto pledge its support, but as yet no-one's been able to determine to which side they\ngave it. At this point, the Danish government\nproclaimed that it would support the opposite\nside to the Greenland government, whichever\nthat was. And of course, the Pope offered to\ntry to reconcile the two parties.\nThe British Premier, who is affectionately\nknown to her comrades as the Tin Lady,\nexpressed acute disappointment in the\n'ungentlemanly conduct' of the students\nUnion for not informing the College\nauthorities of the occupation on the day it\nbegan.\nAs far as the history of student\ndemonstration goes, the occupation of the\nHalls of Residence is a new and previously\nun tired method of protest. Its effectiveness as\na political weapon can be gauged by the trial\nof government emissaries and celebrities that\nhave visited the scene of these tumult o us events during the course of the day.\nAt three o 'clock this afternoon, the Minister\nof Ignorance, Sir Archibald Balderdash,\narrived in his chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce.\nClearly the government expenditure cuts\nhave hit both rich and poor. He hurried into\nthe Union office, wher he consulted with the\nPresident for an hour.\nHe told me afterwards, that their talks had\nbeen 'affable, constructive and promising',\nthough nothing was achieved. After all,\nbecause of this, there was every hope that in\nthe future something would be achieved.\nWhen I asked him what step the government\nwould take next, he replied that he'd first have\nto consult with his minister. Then I reminded\nhim that he was the minister. He scratched his\nhead, got into his car and was quickly driven\naway.\nBy eight o 'clock, still nothing had\nhappened. There had been no riot, no mass\ndemonstration, nor indeed the slightest\nvisible sign of unrest. This made us all the\nmore troubled. The continued silence and\ninactivity of the students was a clear\nindication that the situation was deteriorating.\nAt the same time, Ministers were\nassembling at Downing Street to attend an\nemergency cabinet meeting. By now, the\nhavoc wreaked by the effects of the\noccupation were well known: in the City, gold\nprices quadrupled as the market was smitten\nby a bout of panic-selling; the FU index\nplummeted to an all time low of minus infinity;\nthe Governor of the Bank of England\ncommitted suicide; and Marie Blancmaison,\nthe famous TV personality, gave birth to\nkittens, who were said to be doing well under\nthe circumstances.\nIt was evident to everyone that the nation\nwas looking over a precipice. One false move\ncould set off a chain of events which could\nonly result in bedlam and catastrophe.\nYet as the Cabinet sat in deadlock, all\nremained calm in the Halls of Residence. One\nreally must marvel at the cunning approach\nthat the students have adopted. It has been so\nca sue al that one was almost inclined to think\nthat there is no occupation. But of course this\nis ludicrous.\nThen we heard that the Cabinet meeting\nhad finished. A press release emphasised the\ngravity of the situation that the government\nfaced,and assured the public that it would do\neverything in its power to avert a major\ndisaster. Finally, it said that if the situation did\nnot improve before the opening of the\ngrouse-shooting season next week, a national emergency w oui d be declared.\nAt ten o 'clock, the Fondas and the\nRedgraves showed up at the Halls of\nResidence as a token gesture of solidarity.\nThe forces of freedom began to rally behind\nthe students. Arthur Slagtip, the Miners'\nUnion leader, was heard to mumble\nsomething about 'taking their lead'. An hour\nlater, the radio announced that his men had\noccupied their mines and had already\nformulated a shift system. Apparently, the\nWelsh miners, rather than becoming bored,\nwere passing the time by digging for coal.\nThe NC B were said to be delighted.\nThen a few more celebrities turned up:\nEliot Gould arrive from Jerusalem where he\nwas playing the lead role in the sequel to the\nfilm, 'God'. When I asked him for his frank\nopinion on the students, he said, he'd take his\nhat off to them, while Emanuelle said she'd take off her knickers. This was at about eleven\nthirty, by which time there were only a few\nlights burning in the Halls of Residence. Not a sound could be heard. The silence was\nmenacing. Obviously the students were\ntrying to deceive us into thinking that they\nwere not as revolting as we would believe.\nThen at last, at twelve fifteen in the\nmorning, the drama reached its climax. The\ngovernment capitulated. All was resolved.\nRather than lose face by meeting the\nstudents' demands, they preferred to resign.\nA spokesman for the in-coming government\ndeclared that their first act would be to\nimplement the demands in full.\nWhen I rushed into the Halls of Residence\nto tell the students of their pyrrhic victory, the\nonly person I could find was the night porter,\nwho was fast asleep.\n15\n\n"

    "content": "THREE SHARE NOBEL PRIZE\nKUNGL. VETENSKAPSAKADEMIENITHE ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES/CINA\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\nhas decided to award the 1979 Nobel Prize in\nphysics to be shared equally between\nProfessor Sheldon L Glashow, Harvard\nUniversity, USA, Professor Abdus Salam,\nInternational Centre for Theoretical Physics,\nItaly and Imperial College, Great Britain, and\nProfessor Steven Weinberg, Harvard\nUniversity, USA, for their contributions to the\ntheory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between\nelementary particles, including inter alia the\nprediction of the weak neutral current.\nPhysics, like other sciences, aspires to find\ncommon causes for apparently unrelated\nnatural and experimental observations. A classical example is the force of gravitation\nintroduced by Newton to explain such\ndisparate phenomena as the apple falling to\nthe ground and the moon moving around the\nearth.\nAnother example occured in the nineteenth\ncentury, when it was realized, mainly through\nthe work of Oersted in Denmark and Faraday\nin England, that electricity and magnetism\nare closely related, and are really different\naspects of the electromagnetic force or\ninteraction between charges. The final\nsynthesis was presented in the 1860s by\nMaxwell in England. His work predicted the\nexistence of electromagnetic waves and\ninterpreted light as an electromagnetic wave\nphenomenon.\nThe discovery of the radioactivity of certain\nheavy elements towards the end of last\ncentury, and the ensuing development ofthe\nphysics of the atomic nucleus, led to the\nintroduction of two new forces or\ninteractions: the strong and the weak nuclear\nforces.\nUnlike gravitation and electromagnetism\nthese forces act only at very short distances,\nof the order of nuclear diameters or less.\nWhile the strong interaction keeps protons\nand neutrons together in the nucleus, the\nweak interaction causes the so-called\nradioactive beta-decay. The typical process\nis the decay of the neutron: the neutron, with\ncharge zero, is transformed into a positively\ncharged proton, with the emission of\nnegatively charged electron and neutral,\nmassless particle, the neutrino.\nAlthough the weak interaction is much\nweaker than both the strong and the\nelectromagnetic interactions, it is of great\nimportance in many connections. The actual\nstrength of the weak interaction is also of\nsignificance. The energy of the sun, all-important for life on earth, is produced when\nhydrogen fuses or burns into helium in a chair n of nuclear reactions occurring in the\ninterior of the sun. The first reaction in this\nchain, the transformation of hydrogen into\nheavy hydrogen (deuterium), is caused by\nthe weak force. Without this force solar\nenergy production would not be possible.\nAgain, had the weak force been much\nstronger, the life span of the sun would have\nbeen too short for life to have had time to\nevolve on any planet. The weak interaction\nfinds practical application in the radioactive\nelements used in medicine and technology,\nwhich are in general beta-radioactive, and in\nthe beta-decay of a carbon iso type into\nnitrogen, which is the basis for the carbon 14\nmethod for dating of organic archaeological\nremains.\nAbdus\nSalam\nTheories of Weak Interaction\nA first theory of weak interaction was put\nforward already in 1934 by the Italian\nphysicist Fermi. However, a satisfactory\ndescription of the weak interaction between\nparticles at low energy could be given only\nafter the discovery in 1956that the weak force differs from the other forces in not being\nreflection symmetric; in other words, the\nweak force makes a distinction between left\nand right. Although this theory was valid only\nfor low energies and thus had a restricted\ndomain of validity, it suggested a certain\nkinship between the weak and the_ ele cro magnetic interactions.\nIn a series of separate works in the I960s\nthis year's Nobel prize winners, Glashow,\nSalam and Weinberg, developed a theory\nwhich is applicable also at higher energies,\nand which at the same time unifies the weak\nand electromagnetic interactions in a common formalism. Glashow, Salam and\nWeinberg started from earlier contributions\nby other scientists. Of special importance\nwas a generalization of the so-called gauge\nprinciple for the description of the\nelectromagnetic interaction. This gen realization was worked out around the\nmiddle of the I950s by Yang and Mills in USA.\nAfter the fundamental work in the I960s the\ntheory was made in I97I by the young Dutch\nphysicist't Hooft.\nThe theory predicts among other things the\nexistence of a new type of weak interaction, in\nwhich the reacting particles do not change\ntheir charges. This behaviour is similar to\nwhat happens in the electromagnetic\ninteraction, and one says that the interaction\nproceeds via a neutral current. One should\ncontrast this with the beta-decay of the\nneutron, where the charge is altered when the\nneutron is changed into a proton.\nFirst Observation of the Weak Neutral\nCurrent\nThe first observation of an effect ofthe new\ntype of weak interaction was made in I973 at\nthe European nuclear research laboratory,\nCERN, in Geneva in an experiment where\nnuclei were bombarded with a beam of\nneutrinos. Since then a series of neutrino\nexperiments at Cern and at the Fermi\nLaboratory near Chicago have given results\nin good agreement with theory. Other\nlaboratories have also made successful tests\nof effects of the weak neutral current\ninteraction. Of special interest is a result,\npublished in the summer of I978, of an\nexperiment at the electron accelerator at\nS LAC in Stanford, USA. In this experiment\nthe scattering of high energy electrons on\ndeuterium nuclei was studied and an effect\ndue to \u2022 a direct interplay between the\nelectron magnetic and weak parts of the\nunified interaction could be observed.\nInteraction Carried by Particles\nAn important consequence of the theory is\nthat the weak interaction is carried by\nparticles having some properties in common\nwith the photon, which carries the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles. These so-called weak\nvector bosons differ from the massless\nphoton primarily by having a large mass; this\ncorresponds to the short range of the weak\ninteraction. The theory predicts masses of\nthe order of one hundred proton masses, but\ntoday's particle accelerators are not powerful\nenough to be able to produce these particles.\nThe contributions awarded tr f is year's Nobel Prize in physics have been of great\nimportance for the intense development of\nparticle physics in this decade.\nSheldon L Glashow: Born in New York on\nDecember 5th, I932; PhD from Harvard\nUniversity I959; Professor in physics at the\nLyman Laboratory, Harvard University, since\nI967.\nAddress\nProfessor Sheldon L Glashow\nLyman Laboratory,\nHarvard University\nCambridge, Mass.

    "content": "Dear Colin,\nHere's another letter about the\nFrank James controversy (did he\nreally write his letter just to get a correspondence going in the\nFELIX letters column?).\nI'm a fresher and like SD Goulder\nin last week's FELIX, I have made\nup my own mind. However, I disagree with Frank James main\nconclusions in that, while I think\nthat some of his criticisms are\nvalid, the solutions that he\nsuggests would not, in fact, work.\nStudents seem to need some way\nof 'letting off steam' and how this\nis done varies from one student to\nanother; some listen to loud\nmusic, others drown their academic worries in beer and play\nthe most trivial of childish games\nuntil the early hours of the\nmorning.\nNothing can change this facet of\nhuman nature; so it is only\nreasonable that some form of\norganization is present in college\nto supervise( and even encourage) such recreational\nactivities, and furthermore, to\nensure that they do not get out of\nhand. The CC Us fulfill this\nfunction admirably while at the\nsame time coordinating academic\nproblems and raising a very large\namount of money for charity. I feel\nthat a single central organization\nwould not be able to do this nearly\nas efficiently; because by the\nnature of their purposes the CC Us are each a 'personal' organization\nto which each student can feel\nthat he or she 'belongs'. A large\nbody such as ICU is too immense\nfor the average fresher (et al) to\nidentify with.\nThe CC Us provide a lot of\nenjoyment for their members, and\nwhile being far from perfect (is\nanyone, even Frank James?), I believe they should be retained,\neven if perhaps 'cleaned up' a little.\nSincerely,\nJeremy Nunns ( EE1) PS - Re the infamous comment: I don't particularly like beer, and\nhave the usual male inclinations.\nDear Sir,\nIam indeed disappointed( though not altogether surprised)\nthat the U GM, last Tuesday saw fit\nto reject the motion calling for the\nbanning of the Rag Mag. I found\nits contents polluted with obscene\nand sick 'jokes', and as a member\nof the overseas student community here, I was very\noffended and moreover, disheartened by its racialist\novertones. Despite those cynics\nwho may smirk 'tough' or 'too\nbad', I wholeheartedly agree with\nMr Gujral's condemnation of it.\nMay I also point out that Lord\nFlowers has expressed his disapproval in this matter. In fact, I would be amazed if other IC\nstudents are not themselves of the\nsame opinion.\nThe arguments presented by\nthe motion's opponents struck me\nas being contradictory, facetious\nand even hypocritical. Substantially they were as follows:\ni. The Rag Mag is published with\nthe intent to raise money for\ncharities (a most commendable\ncause which no-one can surely\nbegrudge) and therefore a certain\ndegree of licence in its contents is\nto be permitted( which presumably is as equally commendable).\nii. The magazine had already been\nsold( despite some legal aberrations) and to withdraw or\nban it would cause some inconvenience, especially as the\nmoney raised could be spent\nprofitably by the charities.\nSome of my subsequent comments may appear to certain\nfactions of the student populace\nto be a trifle unrealistic and\nmoralistic, but I feel they are\nnecessary to the issue.\n\"The hallmark of her work has\nbeen respect for the individual\nhuman being, for his or her dignity\nand innate value.\"\nFirstly, the above quotation is an\nextract of a tribute paid by the\nchairman of the Nobel award\ncommittee to Mother Theresa, the\nrecipient of this year's peace\nprize. It stresses the respect one\nhuman being ought to have for\nanother, a respect which should\nnot be diminished by any\naffliction a person may endure.\nClearly many of the 'jokes' are\nhardly respectful of a person's race, creed, colour or situation. It\nis all very well saying, \"no harm\nintended\" or \"it's only a joke,\"\nbut such phrases only belie the\nessential cruelty and insulting\nbehaviour inherent in these jokes.\nOne does not have to suffer from\nparanoia to dislike being ridiculed\nor laugh ted at. I am somewhat\nmystified then, that IC students,\nalbeit not saints, do not share\nMother Theresea's respect for\nindividual dignity, and have\npermitted and even condoned the\nfree licence granted to the\ncompilers (the term editors is I feel, rather inappropriate) of the\nmagazine.\nSecondly, perhaps Iam confused, but I am under the\nimpression that we students are\nfirst and foremost human beings.\nIt is idiotic to suppose that people\nare not offended by certain jokes\nmerely because they are students\nand can therefore adopt such an\nen lighted status and condescending attitude towards this\nRag Mag.\nIt was also noticeable that many\npeople at the U GM believed that it\nwas too late to act after the 'horse\nhad bolted'. This appears to imply\nthat some saw the Rag Mag as\npotentially obscene etc., but\nnevertheless believed it was more\nexpedient to proceed with its\ncirculation. Is this then not\nan irresponsible and hypocritical\nattitude?\nUnfortunately, it seems that the\nmatter has been settled irrevocably and the proceeds\nheading for a deserving charity. I wonder, would it be a fair\nassumption on my part to expect\nthe rag committee to donate a copy of the mag to the recipient\ncharity as a substantive memento\nof their efforts. I am sure it will be\ngreeted with great interest. I would also hope that IC students\nwill ensure that all future Rag\nMags be subject to more stringent\neditorial control to prevent the\npresent situation repeating itself\nand causing further embarrass-ment.\nI must finally add that it is\nunfortunate that in the same week\nas Professor Abdus Salam of the\nphysics department was honoured by a Nobel Prize, the\nname and prestige of our college\nwill inevitably be tarnished.\nYours respectfully,\nRumar SingaRajah\nEE PG ICWA\nFRESHERS\nBALL\nFRIDAY 9TH NOV.\nSherry 7:00 for 7:30 in the\nConsort Gallery, Sherfield.\nWith singer Frankie\nArmstrong and the Mekkers.\nTickets \u00a37.50 (\u00a36.50 for women\nfresher s) from ICWA lounge\nlunchtimes or Annie in the Union\nOffice.\n6\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX me III cry\nAs you may or may not know, depending on\nwhether you managed to grab one of the\nrationed copies of last week's FELIX, ICU has\nbeen in occupation in the senior dining room.\nThis was intended to, and did illicit a response from the outside world. Other\nstudent unions, the college authorities,\npoliticians and the media have all reacted to\nvarying extents. It was intended to increase\nawareness amongst students of this and\nother colleges.\nThe attendance in the occupation\nobviously varied from time to time, generally\nit was fair, sometimes it was either good or\nbad. I am heartened by the number of 'non\nhacks' who care but, obviously not satisfied.\nThe Committee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals (CVCP) upon which such people\nas our own rector sits has reacted with\nunprecedented swiftness and firmness\nagainst recently published plans to charge\nthis legendary full economic cost to overseas\nstudents, and to deduct the appropriate sum\nfrom universities' budget.\nIndeed the CVCP seem much more\nconcerned than many student unions,\nperhaps indicating that the situation is not\njust in the minds of anti-Tory com mies. To\nquote Sir Alec Merrison, Chairman of ViceChancellors Committee: \"....the government\nproposes to remove a substantial part of our\nincome under the fallacious belief that it\ncorresponds to the 'subsidy' to overseas\nstudents, leaving universities to recoup\nwhatever they can by charging so-called\n'economic fees', which would have to be at a level far in excess of anything charged to\nstudents anywhere else in the world.\n\"The effect of these policies upon our\nuniversities and their students - both from\nhome and overseas - is potentially disastrous.\nThey will undermine institutions which are\nvital national assets of international renown.\nWhatever the pressures to reduce public to\nreduce public expenditure the government\nmust sustain such institutions; to do less will\ncause grave damage to the country's ability to\nsurvive in an increasingly competitive world.\nMy committee implores the Secretary of State\nto think again.\"\nOnce again that is not some 'whining lefty'\nbut someone at the top of the educational\nadministration and not given to over-reaction.\nPeople have complained that they voted for\na balanced president and this action is\nsomehow unbalanced. In my manifesto\nwhilst speaking out against politics in student\nunions and whilst being a non-political\nperson, I did say that there are educationally\npolitic issues and I cited overseas students\nfees and grants as such issues.

    "content": "A LETTERS\nM PAGE IL j MORE\n\\ ^ LETTERS\nON PAGE 6\nDear Sir,\nJon Marsden and Jon Fewtrell\nmight be interested to note that,\ncontrary to 'heir misguided\nassertion in FEL.X last week, not\nall who supported the occupation\nmotion did so as they suggested\n(ie by preparing themselves to\nmiss lectures for as long as\ndeemed necessary), but that for\nmany it was a spontaneous\nresponse to a most critical issue. I like many others, had no preconceived notions of the\nmeeting's outcome, but felt\ncompelled to react in this way to\nthe Conservative assault on our\ncountry's educational values.\nHowever, the brunt of my\ndisapproval must fall on Richard\nWormsley whose attack on Chris\nFox' s action can only be\nconstrued as vociferous support\nfor these intolerable government\npolicies. I would ask him; does\nany mandate, regardless of size,\ngive any government, regardless\nof politics, the right to wield its\nlegislative axe unchallenged,\neven if it does so with the blind\nthrashing of the present government. The answer is simply\na vigorous NO, for otherwise a path would be laid conducive to\ndictatorial leadership.\nWe have been confronted with\npolicies which are founded in\nsocial injustice rather than\neconomical necessity. Educational elitism has found a resurgence initiated by sweeping\neducational cuts opposed only by\na financial influx into the private\neducation sector. Foreign students are lambasted by\nproposed massive fee increases\nas Britain slams shut the door on\neducational advancement on\nanything other than on a purely\nintrospective, national level.\nThose cuts threaten to erode the\nBritish educational system whilst\njuxtaposing it with one founded\non privilege. The economics of\nthe cuts are ridiculed by the\ninsidious and massive proposed\nincreases in defence expenditure.\nIf in the light of these proposals,\nthe students of this college still\nfeel indebted to apathy, then on\ntheir own conscience is this\ncountry' s future. Otherwise support our Union's attempts at\nmobilizing student and public\nopinion. IC may yet cat aly se feelings that this government\ncannot suppress and successfully\nforce them, by popular opinion, to\nstep down on the issues in\nquestion.\nRobert Wilson\nPet Eng 2\nSir,\nRe: The current Rag Mag.\nAs editor of this outstanding\nentity, I was shocked, nay mildly\nstunned, to witness the total\ncollapse of sensibilities within this\ncollege. Some particularly nasty\nindividuals seem to have leapt\nupon the bandwagon: \"Let's ban\nthis sexist, racist and depraved\npublication, especially the\nvolks wagon joke.\"\nFirstly, I disagree that this label\napplies and secondly, I have\nneither the time nor the bir o ink to\nspare on the subject of Rag Mag\nmaterial; after all, some of us have\nexcellent degrees to work for.\nA subject worth far more\nconsideration is the intervention\nof the college solicitors in\nconnection with the fact that our\nRag Mag did not boast the\nprinters' imprint.\nThese individuals, in their\nconcern for the financial wellbeing of our union, saw fit to\nwarn our union of the possible\nconsequences of distributing\nsuch an illegal document. A wise\nmove, I say, as they seem to think\n(I have been told that they are not\nabsolutely certain, however) that\nsuch an offence carries a fine of\nfive pounds per copy sold, both to\nthe publisher and the printer. I know not whether this be true or\nfalse; I would appreciate some\ncorrespondence from said college solicitors upon the matter,\nas I have not had the time\n(pressure of academic work) to\ntravel to HM SO in Holborn to\nobtain the relevant printing acts\n\u2022 However, in my South Kensington based search for the\ntruth, I telephoned the managing-director of Chamelion Press (the\nprinters of such publications as\nthe 'Alternative Prospectus'. 'Spanner' and colla tors of the 'IC\nUnion Handbook'), obviously a very distinguished company, who\nrefused to print our Rag Mag and\nwho very nearly always put their\nimprint upon their printed material. Off the top of his head,\nhe informed me that the fine was\ntwenty pounds per copy sold,\nboth to the printer and publisher.\nHe did say, however, that he was\nnot sure of this.\nI next telephoned Private Eye\n(who have contributed to the Rag\nMag) to speak to their legal\ndepartment, but he had gone\nhome. However, another gentleman from the Eye said that\nhe was pretty damn sure that you\ncould be imprisoned for such an\noffence, but he was not that sure.\nSo there we have it: a five pound\nfine (College), a twenty pound\nfine (Chamelion) or imprisonment\n(Eye).\nNow, do you remember 'Jamrag'? This was our Rag Mag\ntwo years ago. Imagine my\nsurprise when I discovered that\nthe printers' imprint was absent,\nthus making all ten thousand\ncopies distributed quite illegal. If\nonly college solicitors had been\nso efficient two years ago, the\nunion would have been saved a possible prosecution resulting in\nan almost .certain fine of fifty\nthousand pounds or perhaps two\nhundred thousand pounds or\nmaybe imprisonment.\nI tremble at the thought that if\nsome particularly nasty individual\nwere to take this year's Rag Mag to\ncourt (number distributed : six\nhundred) then obviously the\nJamrag would have to be cited as\na major previous offence. Gosh!\nHow terrible!\nAlso, isn't it a pity that colleges\nsuch as the South Bank Poly,\nCoventry, Edinburgh (Patron:\nHRH, alias 'the Duke' ) and\nShoreditch (to name four that I have personal knowledge of) do\nnot have such an efficient team of\nsolicitors.\nHowever, two years ago, ours\nweren't particularly efficient\neither. Boy, Oh Boy! AmI glad that\nthey've sharpened their wits over\nthe last two years. Mind you, with\ncollege taking such an active\ninterest in this year's Rag Mag in\ngeneral, especially its detrimental\neffect upon overseas students'\nfees, not to mention the fact that it\nrenders the occupation as totally\nmeaningless, this is understood.\nFinally, anyone wishing to come\nand help stamp ten thousand Rag\nMags with the printers' imprint,\nusing rubber stamps that the\nprinters, Minstral Press, have\nsupplied us with (financial\nsetback of fifty pounds to\nthemselves) will be welcomed\nwith open arms.\nSJ Marshall\nDear Colin,\nI would like to apologize to Rae\nand Steve for saying the Rag Mag\nwas sexist It should have read\n'blatantly crude and racist' as\nelsewhere in the letter. I do not,\nhowever, withdraw anything else\nThere are also inaccuracies in\nRae's letter which I would like to\npoint out:\ni. Raesaidthatthereareonlyeight\nJewish jokes and that the word\nwo g' appears only once Since\nRae took the trouble of counting\nall the jokes, I felt that I could do\nno less. She has got both of these\nfigures wrong. There are also\nother racist jokes or words, which\ndo not fall in these categories, but\nare no less racist for that. Having\nread previous IC Rag Mags and\nthose of other colleges I consider\nit to be more racist than most.\nThere are too many Irish and\nJewish jokes and it is the quantity,\nas well as the quality, which\nmakes them offensive.\nii. If Rae read the letter carefully,\nshe would notice that nobody\naccused her of making excuses -only the exec. If Chris and\nMalcolm had felt that strongly\nabout the mag, they would have\nacted more decisively, instead of\nopting out by disassociating\nthemselves from the Rag Mag.\nThe exec is the caretaker\ngovernment of the union during\nthe holiday and it was up to them\nto act.\niii. Nobody in the letter used their\nofficial position to 'give power to\ntheir personal opinions', apart\nfrom myself. I had the full backing\nof my committee, chair t nen of\nseveral national societies and\nseveral students had expressed\nstrong opinions about it. The\nothers in . the letter signed\nthemselves as ordinary students\nat IC which I thought was their\nprivilege, if they so wished to do\nso.\nAccording to Rae's motion at the\nU GM, the Rag Mag is for\n'broad minded' students. If that is\nthe case, then since Rae, Chris\nand Malcolm disassociated themselves from it does that mean\nthat they are not broad minded? I personally prefer to think that\nthey have some standard of\ndecency that they think should be\nmaintained.\nIC already has a bad reputation\nwith other colleges about its Rag\nMag and this is not going to help\nto improve that image.\nYours since rly, A Gujral\nDear Colin,\nWhen will the officers of IC\nUnion finally realize that they do\nNOT have the support of students.\nAs we are all aware at the last\nUnion meeting the motion on\neducation cuts was railroaded by\nthe Union executive. The amendments which basically said\nthat we do not believe in an\noccupation was defeated by the\nnarrowest of margins. An amendment (which I believe a large number of students supported) asking the Union to\nsupport the cuts in increased\nexpenditure was not even allowed\nto be discussed True demo c racy?\nWe have been told that Ihe\noccupation of the SDR was\ndesigned not for maximum disruption ol College, but\n'maximum publicity' Who rn nll y believes that a few lino s in the\nGuardian and ab rio! mention on\nRadio. London is maximum publicity? Even Sonnet the\nnewspaper of London students'\ndoes not mention the occupation\nBernard Smith\n4\n\n"

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Friday, October 26th,1979 Issue NO. 531\nLord Flowers, Rector of Imperial College of Science and Technology, in his\nCommemoration Day address yesterday called for selectivity in making public\nexpenditure cuts in higher education. Stating that there are a few too many\nuniversities and far too many polytechnics Lord Flowers argued that some\nmust go in order that others shall live ....\n'If Imperial College is... chosen to go ...\nthat would be better than that we all\nsink into the morass of mediocrity.'\nAt a well attended Commemoration Day\nCeremony, the Rector, Lord Flowers spoke\nout against the proposed education cuts.\nHe called it \"Distasteful discrimination\"\nwhich would make our partnership in\nEurope harder to ache ive. The effects of\ncharging the full fees to Overseas students\nare numerous. 'It removes opportunities for\npostgraduate work from poorer students of\nthe Third World. It belittles the substantial\ncontributions these students have made to\nour research. It is wrong,' stated Lord\nFlowers. Professor Abdus Salam, who\nrecently gained the Nobel prize for physics,\nstarted off as an overseas student at\nCambridge.\nHe added that \"I do not question the\nnecessity to reduce expenditure. I do not\nprotest that universities should all understand what it means in realistic terms.\n'In a drought you have to channel the\navailable water to where it will do most\ngood. Some crops must perish in order that\nothers shall survive. You have to be\nselective. During the coming months we\nshall therefore be looking most carefully at\nour courses, at our research activities, at\nour support services, even at whole\ndepartments, to see whether they should all\ncontinue. Unless we are selective there can\nbe no vitality, no growth, nor even the\nmaintenance of excellence where as a college we have most to offer.\"\n\"But the main task of selectivity lies\nelsewhere. It lies with the Government and\nwith the University Grants committee. The\nfact is that there are a few too many\nuniversities in this country, and far too\nmany polytechnics. Some must go in order\nthat some must live. If Imperial College is\nchosen to go, so be it. Even that would be\nbetter than that we all sink into the morass\nof mediocrity.\"\nAt the presentation ceremony, itself, 383\nstudents were granted Associateship of\nCity and Guilds, 388 of the Royal College of\nScience and 110 of the Royal School of\nMines. Five people, including Jean-Jacques\nBaron, \"Mickey Davies and Sir Monty\nFinniston, were made Fellows of Imperial\nCollege.\nFULL TEXT OF THE\nCOMMEMORATION DAY\nADDRESSES ARE ON\nPAGES 10 & 11\n\n"

    "content": "WELFARE\nCOVENANTS - A GIFT FROM THE TAXMAN\nIf your parents contribute to your grant,\nyou can use a covenant as a painless way of\nincreasing the money that they give you by\n43%.\nCovenants were developed as a means of\naiding tax-exempt charities but there is no\nreason why they shouldn't be used to help\ntax-exempt people of which impecunious\nstudents are the prime example.\nThe idea of a deed of covenant in this\ncontext is quite simply that your parents\ncommit to writing an undertaking to pay a certain sum of money each year for a period\ncapable of exceeding six years. After each\npayment you get a form from the tax office, fill\nit in and return it to your tax office and they\nwill then refund you the basic rate tax that\nyour parents have already paid on the money\nthat you receive under the covenant.\nHow to do it\nThe Consumer Association has devised a form of deed which the tax man should\naccept and they have given me permission to\nreproduce it here. It runs as follows:\n/, Edward Smith, of 16 Moon Street,\nBlackburn, covenant to pay my son, William\nSmith, of the same address, a gross amount\nof 116.67 on each of the following dates in\neach year, namely 1 October, 1 January, 1\nApril, for the period of seven years, or for the\nperiod of our joint lives, or until he ceases to\nbe receiving full time education at any\nuniversity, college, school or other\neducational establishment (whichever is the\nshortest period), the first payment to be made\n1 October, 1979.\nDated 1 September, 1979\nSigned, sealed and delivered by Edward\nSmith:\nin the presence of:\n(witness' signature and address)\nIt is advisable to follow this example\nexactly, substituting the appropriate names,\naddresses, amounts and dates of payment.\nThere are certain points to watch out for:\n1. You can't benefit from a covenant unless\nyou are eighteen or married.\n2. The instalments can be paid at whatever\nintervals you like but the first one must come\nafter the date on which the covenant is\nsigned.\n3. Amount - this can be stated either as 'a gross amount of \u00a3x' as in the example, which\nmeans that your parents deduct the tax which\nyou will get back, from the total contribution\nand pay you the rest. This means that they\nhave to alter the amount that they actually\ng. ive you every time the basic rate changes.\nSo if the parental contribution is \u00a3100 and tax\nis at 30% they wo uj d hand over \u00a370 and you\nwould get the other \u00a330 from the tax man. If\nthe basic rate then went down to 25%, they\nwould have to pay you \u00a375.\nThe other way of doing it is to agree to pay\n'an amount which after deduction of tax at the\nbasic rate amounts to \u00a3x'. This means that\nthey pay the same amount all the time, but the\nrefund from the tax man will vary with\nchanges in the basic rate. This second variety\nis apparently the most common.\n4. The formalities. You can copy out the\ncovenant with alterations and it doesn't really\nmatter how you do this. The important thing\nis that it must be signed by whoever is paying\nand witnessed by someone other than\nyourself. It might be advisable if the witness\nwas someone other than your parent\nalthough it probably wouldn't matte.\nHowever, since you don't know whether the\ntax man will query it until the end of the tax\nyear when, in a sense, it is too late, it is best to\nplay safe. The other important thing to\nremember is that THE DEAL MUST BE SEALED. You can do this with sealing wax or\na disc of red paper which you stick onto the\ndeed. Your parents should then hand the\ndeed over to you.\n5. The covenant can be cancelled by mutual\nconsent at any time.\nOther Earnings\nThe amount covenanted - ie what you get\nfrom your parents plus what you get from the\ntax man - counts as earned income. This\nmeans that if your vacation earnings plus the\nmoney received under the covenant total\nmore than \u00a31,165, you will start paying tax on\nthe excess. It is possible, however, that since\nyou recover basic rate tax at 30% and pay\nlower rate tax at 2 5 % on the first \u00a3750 over\n\u00a31,165 that you might still make a profit.\nClaiming the money back\nGet a form R185( AP) from your tax office,\nfor your parents to fill in and send back. If you\nhaven't got a tax office look in the telephone\nbook under Inland Revenue and contact the\none nearest to where you live.\nIf you want any more details on any of this,\nplease come and see me in the Welfare\nCentre on the third floor of the Union\nBuilding which is open from 9:30 to 5:30every weekday.\nMichael Arthur\nWelfare Adviser\nPG\nTIPS\nThe turn-out for the postgraduate group\ncommittee meeting on Wednesday, 17\nOctober, to discuss social events and PhD time lengths was disappointing, so I had\nbetter use these pages to try and get the\nmessage across.\nWe are very concerned at the fact that many\nstudents take longer than three years to finish\na PhD( some students are in their fifth and\nsixth years) and feel that this situation is one\nwhich must be investigated seriously with a view to remedying this blatant defect. All\npostgraduates in the college will be receiving\na questionnaire shortly so that we may find\nout your views on this subject.\nThe Group also has a duty to stage social\nevents throughout the year and possibilities\nwere discussed at the meeting. It was decided\nto look into the possibility of holding a postgraduate dinner sometime and also a barbecue on 5 November with a plough man's lunch as a contingency plan, should either of\nthe first two be found impossible to stage.\nThe response from individual departments\nin claiming grants for social functions has\nbeen almost non-existent. I therefore say\nagain that all departments are entitled to a grant for social functions involving PG s( apply to myself c/o Union Office). Last, but\nnot least, would anyone who is interested in\nplaying football in the park at lunch-times\nplease contact Martin Baggs, who is\ncoordinating it.\nRichard Earl\nPG Group Chairman\nIG\n/LIBERAL\n/ CLUB \\\nThe LIBERAL Club can be contacted at its\nregular informal Friday lunchtime meeting in\nStan's Bar.Southside.\nIC LIBERAL CLUB\nThe fresher s' plough mans supper was a resounding success with all those attending\ntaking part in a lively discussion of relevant\nunion affairs, including the incredulous\nattitude of some members of the Union\ntowards apart eid in general, and the\natrocious rugby match played recently with a South African team in particular. The success\nof the meeting was completed when all those\nattending joined the club!\nIt had been hoped to have David Alton,\nLiberal MP for Liverpool Edge Hill and the\nyoungest MP at Westminster, at the meeting.\nHowever, arrangements are now in hand to\ninvite him (with his radical ideas on student\nhousing) to address a meeting later in the\nterm - so watch out for the posters !\nTwo posts on the committee have yet to be\nfilled. These are secretary and ordinary\nmember, responsible for policy, union and\nexternal affairs. The papers are now upon the\nS CC noticeboard in Southside and come\ndown at 5pm Thursday, 1 November. This is\nan ideal opportunity for all members to\nactively take part in the decision making of\nthe college's most active and radical political\nsociety. Membership of the club costs a mere\n30p, payable to the Union receptionist\n(Annie), or any of the club officers.\nBecky Bryan, UL S political vice-chairman,\nhas kindly agreed to address a meeting on\n'Education' (this is the broad title of the talk,\nbut I'm sure that cuts will be the main issue) in\nthe Union Lower Refectory at 6:30pm on\nTuesday, 23rd October. This meeting is a chance for anyone with an interest in matters\nof education (ie cuts) to come along and hear\na liberal's viewpoint and also to represent\ntheir own point of view. I am sure it will be a lively affair!\n( )\n13\n\n"

    "content": "KEEPING OCCUPIED\nI must admit to being absolutely delighted\nwhen the decision was taken to occupy part\nof College block, not just because I thought it\nwas the right thing to do, but also because I thought it would be great fun. It was a chance\nto do something different, to get out of the rut\nof life at IC, and also a matter of personal\npride because I was jealous of friends at other\ncolleges who had taken part in sit-ins.\nThe atmosphere on the first afternoon can\nonly be describe, as euphoric; it was a thrill\njust to be in the SDR at that time surrounded\nby so much enthusiasm and optimism. The\nearly hours of the morning arrived and the\nplace was still active - who were those two\nguys playing table-tennis at 4am? Those with\nforesight had grabbed sleeping bags and\ncamp beds (although, considering the\nnumber of people who found their beds\nfolding up underneath them during the night,\nI think I was better off on the carpet).\nNext morning I awoke to the sight of bodies\nstrewn all over the place, Jo organizing\npeople into clearing up and Pat playing table\ntennis. Christ, I thought, my room is Beit isn't usually like this. Then cleaners came in,\nlooked around in surprise, exchanged a few\ncomments in Italian and went away again.\nThe staff didn't all accept it quite so readily,\nwhen they arrived for their lunch - we\nexplained the situation and only a couple\nseemed put out by it.\nTheir was a sigh of relief from some\nquarters when table tennis club reclaimed\ntheir table on Wednesday afternoon, so Aftab\ntried to get people to play bridge with him\ninstead; not a lot of hope, really, gambling on\nthree-card brag was far more popular. Life\nwas beginning to become organized; for a while music was limited to five arbitrary\ncassettes because Malcolm kept forgetting to\nbring his Sex Pistols tape (cries of 'Thank\nGod!' from Ian) but he did bring in a kettle and\na hacksaw (a Hack-saw? - in case of fire, he\nassured us). Eric replenished our food\nsupplies by going out busking and buying\nwith the proceeds. Mary provided a couple of\npounds of carrots - Waitrose Class J carrots\nat that!\nI felt sorry for two guys who came over after\nseeing the ENTS film on Thursday evening;\nthey had to watch it for a second time, as we\nhad a free showing of it. It was bad enough for\nthem having wasted thirty pence, but they\ndidn't like 'Emmanuelle 2' the first time. There\nwas always the telly to watch, if we felt really\ndesperate for something to do. Out of\nsolidarity with the ITV Unions it only picked\nup BBC1. During the day times most people sat\naround reading Asterix books and Beano and\nthere was the occasional conscientious\nperson writing up lab reports (Caroline). Eric\nand Mick slept in the corner; a good reason\nfor continuing this occupation indefinitely\nis that it was the most permanent and\ncomfortable place either Eric or Mick have\nhad to live for ages.\nNightimes were far more interesting - say\nno more - although Chris insists that this is a respectable sit-in. It is an acquired art to learn\nhow to get to sleep before three, when there's more activity going on around you than in\nStan's on a Saturday night (Strip Snap'? - the\nmind boggles!). It's nice (!) to wake up on a Friday morning knowing that there are still\nhundreds of FELICE S to be collated,\nsomebody (no names mentioned) was still\ncollating them on Friday afternoon.\nAt the end of my most interesting and\nentertaining week at Imperial College I would\nlike to offer thanks to the following people:\n1. The kitchen staff for providing us with the\noccasional plate of sandwiches and pasties.\n2. Chris for giving me the satisfaction of\nthrashing him at table tennis.\n3. Joe for making innumerable cups of tea\nand allowing herself to be insulted.\n4. Eric for the du lc t tones of his guitar and\nanagrams.\n5. Mick for his even better anagrams-did you\nknow that an anagram of Charles Philip\nArthur George Windsor ( HRH Prince of\nWales) is 'Harrow Sloth Craps Huge Pile\nGrinder'!\n6. West London Chaplaincy for the lunch on\nSunday.\n7. Archie for the music centre - a vast\nimprovement on a crackly cassette recorder.J8. The majority at the U GM who gave us the\nopportunity to miss lectures with a good\nreason.\n9. Mick also for losing to himself at table\ntennis in a needle match with his other half at\n1:30am on Wednesday.\nGary Nichols\nDear Sir,\nI would like to raise a few\npoints with regard to the\namendment to the occupation\nmotion proposed by Sholom\nGodsi. Unfortunately there\nwas insufficient time available\nfor this amendment (which\nsupported the government's policy) to be discussed; some\npeople have described this\ndecision as 'undemocratic',\nbut I should point out that the\nprocedural motion that it be\nnot discussed was passed by a large majority.\nMost of this amendment was\nconcerned with arguing that\neducation cuts are an economic necessity; to the\ncontrary, I would argue that a high standard of education is\nvital to Britain's economic\nfuture. We are a small country\nwith too high a population\ndensity to be able to provide\nenough food for ourselves,\nand precious few mineral\nresources, except for a drop of\noil, which will run out in\ntwenty years. So how is it that\nwe retain such a high standard\nof living and are still one of the\nworld's most influential nations?\nThe answer is obvious; we\nrely upon the high degree of\nexpertise shown by our technicians, engineers, sce inti sts and ad mist rat or s, which is respected throughout the world, and upon the\ntrust and goodwill with which\nwe are viewed by foreign\ncountries as a result of the\nnumbers of their people who\nwere educated in this country\n(and thus increasing our\ntrade). Obviously, all of this is\nbased upon us maintaining a high standard of education\nwhich is freely available to\neveryone, whether they live\nand work in Britain or abroad.\nOf course in the short term\ncutbacks in education will\nsave money (or rather give\nThatcher more to spend on\n'defence') and may make a minor contribution towards\neconomic recovery, but it will\nalso cause unemployment in\nthe education sector, many\ncourses will probably have to\nbe closed down, and less\nvaluable research work will be\nable to be done. Also, at the\nmoment many of the best\nstudents in the world come to\nBritain to do research for their\nPhD; will they still be able to\ndo so if the government\nintroduces fees based upon\nthe 'full economic cost' of a course? I doubt it and we\nwould therefore lose students\nwho are potentially among the\nworld's best scientists.\nI would therefore argue that\nthe present government's education policy is the most\nridiculously short-sighted of\nall time, and is purely aimed at\nproviding a small temporary\nbenefit to the economy in\norder to help themselves get\nre-elected in four years' time,\nand gives no regard whatsoever to the jeopardy in\nwhich these policies may put\nthe economy. i a twenty or\nthirty years' time.

    "content": "THE GANG\nOF SIX\nHi there, bureaucracy lovers! We thought it\nwas time to inform you about ICU's super-quango, the Permanent Working Party.\nThese dedicated people are committed to\nfighting inefficiency and corruption in the\nUnion and College and also hope to bring\nseveral sparks of creativity Into a stale, tired\nUnion.\nWe are elected during the summer term to\nsit on Union Council, and to hold our own\ncommittee meetings. Until recently, the PWP\nhas been thought of as a committee formed\nsolely for the purpose of holding meetings,\nbut this year we want to come out of our shells\nand demonstrate that we really do get things\ndone.\nThis year we epitomize every aspect of\nstudent opinion, containing the fib, lab and\ncon club chairman s, as well as aCC U vice-president. This makes us an eminently\nsuitable forum for kindling new ideas. We are:\nGary Dearmer (Chairman)\nMark Clegg (Hon Sec)\nDave Lyons\nTansy Hepton (Token Woman)\nMick Berry\nColin Palmer (Who?)\nWe are currently reviewing union places in\nhall. Are these the unacceptable face of\n'perks for hacks', designed to keep union\nofficers in luxury for the remainder of their IC\ndays; or are they vital aids to people with\nimportant jobs? We are meeting to decide\nnext Monday lunchtime, and soon hope to\nhave a motion on the subject to present to\ncouncil or a UGM.\nIf you want to contact us about this, or any\nother subject you wish us to investigate, just\ndrop a letter into the PWP pigeon-hole in the\nUnion Office.\nPhoto by Marie-ThSrese\nWould you give money to\nthis man?\nGUILDS\nThank God it's Friday, time for the\nastounding well-written, highly informative\nGuilds article. First, a quick look back at what\nhas happened. Four fresher s dinners have\nbeen and gone, all of which were great, with\nMr Mooney doing his best to provide good\nfood (we had five vegetables with our stock\nand you could hardly tell which was which).\nAll the dinners have been well attended, with\nthose who went enjoying themselves\nthoroughly. There is still time to go to your\nown dinner if you are in CCD( Oct 29) or\nMech Eng( Nov 1). These dinners are an\nexcellent opportunity to meet your staff in an\ninformal atmosphere, have a good meal,\nlisten to some good speakers and find out\nsomething embarrassing about the Exec and\nother people.\nOn Saturday, we went to Harrods on our\nannual Silly Sports. All those who went had a thoroughly good time in participating in\nsome games. Nab really is a sadist, although\nhe does look sweet in a policeman's helmet.\nGuilds took about six hundred and fifty\npounds for Rag, bringing our total to over\n\u00a31,500. Look out for the next Rag events.\nComing up is the1 combined C CU Halloween party on Wednesday the 31st. It is\na ticket only party so get yours from the C CU office. We have a bar until 2am and a great\ndisco. Make sure you get your ticket early to\navoid disappointment as it promises to be a great event.\nOn Saturday the 3rd, we will be having a Rag collection and on Sunday the 4th, it's the\nBRIGHTON RUN. 'Bo', our highly esteemed\nmotorized mascot will be part icp a ting in the\nLondon to Brighton veteran car run and you\nhave the chance to see the start of the run at\n8:20am in Hyde Park. Wearing pyjamas to\nshow that you have only just got up, go by\ncoach to Brighton, leaving promptly at 9:15,\nso as to welcome Bo in Brighton with a rousing Boomalaka.

The beer is more\nexpensive than in most Fullers pubs with ES B over fifty pence a pint. The service in the pub\nis good, a cloudy pint was changed even\nbefore I noticed it. Lager is not sold in the pub\non draught, only as bottled pil s. The pub is frequented mainly by younger\npeople, he nse it has a lively atmosphere, but\nlacks the feeling of a local. It is best to visit the\npub during good weather since it is so near\nthe Thames. The pub is within easy reach of\nHamlet Gardens and Ravens court underground station.\n3\n\n"
