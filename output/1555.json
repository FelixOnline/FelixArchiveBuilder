    "content": "McAvoy\u2019s filthy habits\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nFilth\nDirector: Jon S. Baird\nWriters: Jon S. Baird, Irvine Welsh\n(novel)\nStarring: James McAvoy, Jamie Bell,\nJim Broadbent, Imogen Poots, Eddie\nMarsan\nRuntime: 97 minutes\nCertification: 18\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nThanks for Sharing\nDirector: Stuart Blumberg\nWriters: Stuart Blumberg, Matt\nWinston\nStarring: Mark Ruffalo, Gwyneth\nPaltrow, Josh Gad, Alecia Moore, Tim\nRobbins, Joely Richardson\nRuntime: 112 minutes\nCertification: 15\nWelcome to Scotland: where we are\ngreeted by Bruce Robertson (McA-voy), a coke-snorting, alcohol-addict-ed, sex-loving detective who\u2019s gunning\nfor a promotion to the position of detective inspector. In order to get there,\nhe needs to eliminate his competition.\nAnd by eliminate we don\u2019t mean kill,\nbut rather publicly humiliate so they\u2019ll\nbe out of the running. He\u2019s racist, sex-ist, and every kind of -ist you can think\nof, and as we find out more about this\ntroubled man, you begin to question\nthe narrator\u2019s mental state as he has\ndistressing visions that get in the way\nof his boozy, dopey life. That someone\nlike Bruce is in the law enforcement\nline of work already provides some\nsolid groundwork for the film to build\non.\nRobertson\u2019s visions of disturbing animals (pigs, sheep, you name it) don\u2019t\neven begin to cover how energetically\nbonkers this film is. Why is the narrative interrupted at times by Bruce\u2019s\nwife Carole (Shauna Macdonald) who\nconstantly breaks the fourth wall talking to the audience about her married\nlife to Bruce? Why does Bruce keep\nseeing a tar-stained boy in the corner\nof his eyes? Or how about the nightmarish therapy sessions he imagines\nbeing a part of, where Dr Rossi (Jim\nBroadbent), with a grossly enlarged\nsci-fi alien head, keeps hounding\nBruce with unsettling questions?\nA Japanese student who turns up\ndead sets off the motion of events, as\ntaking the lead on this case could effectively get Bruce a step closer to the\npromotion. But the film\u2019s plot never\nremains solely on solving the case, nor\ndoes it concentrate on Bruce\u2019s sly and\ndevious plans to take down his col-leagues. Filth is really all about Bruce,\nand every single detail of his personal\nand professional life is laid out for the\naudience as we try to piece together\njust what on earth must have happened to create such a person.\nMcAvoy is startlingly good in his\nmentally unhinged role that becomes\nmore and more unpredictable and\noutrageous as time passes by. With\nevery nervous twitch he shows, captured closely by so many uncomfortably zoomed-in close-ups, his extremely physical performance is one\nthing that carries the movie and keeps\neverything together despite the many\noff-beat strands that don\u2019t quite gel\nvery well. Arousal of sympathy for a\ncharacter like Bruce is not the easiest task to convey, but with McAvoy\nshowing a softer, more vulnerable side\nto his unsteady self, which plays a pivotal role in selling the big reveal in the\nfinal scenes of the film.\nThe supporting roles are largely unmemorable (Jamie Bell, Imogen Poots\nboth have relatively thankless roles\neven with their big names), aside from\nBroadbent putting on a performance\ntwice as creepy as the one he showed\nus in Moulin Rouge, and Eddie Marsan, the kind-hearted, rich best friend\nof Bruce who is constantly manipulated and pushed around by his detective friend. Being a sensible, insecure\nsoftie suits Marsan, as he is responsible for bringing out both the best\nand worst in Bruce who, quite frankly\ndoesn\u2019t deserve a friend like him.\nAlthough starting with a cynical,\nblack comedy view of Scotland, the\nfilm winds up in places you never\nthought would go. Word is, the novel\nof the same name the film is based on\nis more daring with even less clear\nboundaries. It feels as though that given the film\u2019s title, the overall content\ncould have been more edgy or darker,\nand not perhaps relying solely on the\ntalent of the film\u2019s leading man.\nThe structure is no doubt a mess,\nbut anchored by a superb performance from an actor whose extreme\nvolatility screams mental breakdown,\nFilth is a wacky, unmissable ride, one\nthat is guaranteed to shock and offend\nand quite possibly make you think\ntwice before visiting Scotland.\nLet\u2019s talk about sex addiction baby\nEverything that Shame was, Thanks\nfor Sharing is not. Whereas we saw\nMichael Fassbender spiral wildly out\nof control in Steve McQueen\u2019s harrowing sex-addiction drama, Ruffalo\nand Paltrow star as the couple to root\nfor in this light and often fluffy romantic comedy dealing with the same\nsubject matter.\nAdam (the effortlessly good Ruffalo)\nhas been \u201csober\u201d for five years now:\nand in sex addiction terms, this means\nno pornography, no prostitutes, and\nno one-night-stands. His sponsor\nMike (Robbins) encourages him to\nstart dating again, given how much\nchange he\u2019s shown over the years in\ntheir 12-step recovery programme,\nwhich is when he meets Phoebe (Pal-trow), a fitness freak, at a bug-eating\nparty (no joke).\nTheir relationship develops, and\neventually the dreaded time comes for\nAdam to come clean about his secret\nto the unsuspecting Phoebe who describes herself as a sexual person and\nwants to give him a cringe-worthy\nlap-dance showing off her impeccable\nfigure. Will they survive this and will\nAdam be able to keep his sobriety going and not resort back to his old habits when there are so many distracting\ntriggers around him in everyday life?\nPhoebe and Adam\u2019s romance is the\n\u201csweet\u201d part of the film. Elsewhere\nin the recovery process is the porn-addicted, stress/guilt-eating Neil\n(Gad, of \u2018The Book of Mormon\u2019 fame),\nwhose friendship with fellow sex addict Dede (Alecia Moore aka the singer P!nk- who, if she ever needs a career transition, should definitely give\nacting a go, given her impressive debut\nperformance here) is where the film\nfinds its space for most of the humour.\nMike, Adam\u2019s sponsor, also has his\nshare of drama to handle mostly stemming from his family. His recovering\naddict son returns out of the blue\nclaiming that he has truly kicked the\nhabit this time. His mother, Mike\u2019s\nwife Katie (Richardson, who looks so\nmuch like her mother Vanessa Redgrave that it\u2019s almost scary in certain\nshots) believes him, but Mike refuses\nto let his son back in. This strand deals\nwith the moving drama as family tension escalates and goes to all the familiar places of loud drama and harsh\nwords.\nOverall the three main plots that we\nfollow achieve what they originally set\nout to do. They generate an adequate\nnumber of laughs and they move. Sure\nit\u2019s often contrived, and doesn\u2019t delve\ntoo deep into the real issue at hand,\naside from Ruffalo explaining a thing\nor two about his addiction. There\nare even a couple of scenes that step\naway from the breezy atmosphere to\nportray something more honest and\npainful about being a sex addict but\nit\u2019s clear from the get-go that this isn\u2019t\nsomething the film wants to spend too\nmuch time exploring.\nUltimately everything means well,\nand by addressing a taboo subject the\ndirector has done well not to make\nlight of a serious condition people suf-fer. It provides a very optimistic, hopeful view for those involved, and whilst\nthe actual recovery process cannot seriously be as sugar-coated and colourful as what is shown here, the certain\nelement of a feel-good factor delivered\nby the stellar cast is worth getting invested in.\nImperial Cinema\nThis week, bald, furrow-browed\nsuper villain Gru and his posse of\nMinions are back in Despicable Me\n2!\nFollowing on from the first\nDespicable Me, Gru is now a\ndevoted father of three and a\nreformed supervillain.

    "content": "COMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\nRory Fenton on Integrated Education\nRory Fenton\nColumnist\n@roryfenton\nFRIDAY 11 OCT\nThe Platonic Merits of a Religious Education\nI\nmmanuel Kant, perennial\nphilosopher of the 18th\ncentury, once made two key\ndistinctions. Firstly, objects\nact in accordance with \ufb01xed\nrules. he latter distinction clari\ufb01ed\nthat rational agents (you and I)\nformulate actions with \ufb02ippant\nregard to mere conceptions of\nthose rules. One would therefore\nconclude that certain elements\nof humanity prove to be \ufb02awed.\nMany would concede that Roman\nCatholicism, in recent decades,\nserves as a \ufb01tting allegory. Be it\nthe sex abuse scandals portrayed\nto perpetuate ad in\ufb01nitum or the\nVatican\u2019s dogmatic condemnation\nof contraception, the church has\nreceived its fair share of criticism\n(as has religion as a whole).\nIt must be made clear, however,\nthat these seeds of imperfection\nwere not sewn in the classrooms of\nRoman Catholic schools; indeed\nI believe that faith-oriented\nacademic institutions share a\ncommon thread, having been\nbu\ufb00eted, tarnished and ultimately\nengulfed by recurrent waves of\nvitriolic demagoguery, which\nfrequently (and often surprisingly)\nremains unchallenged. Having\nbeen educated in a Catholic\nGrammar school I feel that the\ndualism between a religious ethos\nand education can stimulate\nplurality, empathy and tolerance in\nthe mind of a student.\nMany claim that faith-oriented\nschools are, paradoxically,\naligned (particularly in England\n& Wales) with elitism. Anecdotes\nof the middle classes forcing their\nchildren to attend mass and other\nreligious services in an e\ufb00ort\nto secure a place in desirable\nschools are innumerable. I will\nconcede that some parents may\ndo so in a vain and conceited\nmanner, exploiting the educational\nconduits provided by religion.\nDespite this, parents cannot\nbe condemned for harbouring\naspirations for their child. It\nmight furthermore be debated\nthat the skewed abundance of faith\nschools in \u201ca\ufb04uent\u201d areas is but\none of a plethora of imperfections\nin the approach of Government to\neducation as a whole.\nOne might care to consider focus\nas the desirable crux of a religious\neducation. In context of Roman\nCatholic schools mathematics,\nscience, humanities and languages are\nbolstered by an ethos of morality and\nreligiosity. Students are encouraged\nto challenge the Raison d\u2019\u00eatre for both\ntheir hopes and e\ufb00orts. On a regular\nbasis in England and Wales, parents\nsend their children to Catholic\nGrammar schools regardless of their\nsecular background. For these people\nreligiosity is no longer the chief focus;\nrather, it is the moralising framework\nawarded to their children, which\nmay in turn act as a cornerstone for\nthe evolution of their academic and\nmoral framework.\nI attended a Saint Patrick\u2019s,\nDownpatrick in the North of\nIreland. People regularly claim that\nthe regional school system (based\non Catholic and State schools) has\nsectarianized and corrupted the\nminds of our youth, concentrating\nthe embattled mentality between\nnationalist and unionist factions. In\nline with my experience I vehemently\ndisagree with Rory Fenton\u2019s view.\nFor many, like it or not, the\njusti\ufb01cation for our school system is\na question of identity over religiosity\nor faith. he nostalgia invoked\nby my time at school makes it\ndi\ufb03cult for me to fashion a cogent\ncounterargument\u2026but I stand\nresolute on a number of points.\nPrimarily, I \ufb01nd myself at\nImperial College London as a direct\nconsequence of the ethos of my\nschool. My teachers convinced\neach and every pupil (in many cases\nsubconsciously) that their endeavours\nwere for the betterment not only of\nthemselves but their family, friends\nand (most \ufb01ttingly) their community.\nhis extended to interfaith\nrelationships.\nSecondly and to conclude, I\nsuspect that integration does not\nneed to be institutionalised or\nlabelled and \ufb01nd nothing sinister\nin that. While my reservations may\nbe platonic, I am convinced that\nthe retention of a religious school\nsystem can aid con\ufb02ict resolution\nin Northern Ireland. We must be\ncareful not to debase the complexity\nof the problems in the North to\nreligious disparity. If things are to\nmove forward all parties must work\ntogether. his will fail if we are not\ncon\ufb01dent in our own creeds, values\nand beliefs. In the \ufb01tting words\nof Seamus Heaney, valued Nobel\nlaureate, we need \u2018room to rhyme\u2019.\nNote that I disagree with Mr.\nFenton\u2019s depicted demographics of\nBelfast.\nP\nublic services should\nbe open to all people,\nregardless of their\nbeliefs. hat so simple a\nstatement should need\nto be shouted is madness and yet\nthis is exactly what is needed in\nthe UK. he truth is that for all our\nadvances in other areas of human\nrights, when it comes to religious\nand belief discrimination in public\nservices, the UK has scarcely\nchanged in 100 years. Nowhere\nis this clearer than in our state\nschools.\nReligious schools make up a third\nof all state schools in the UK and\nare granted astounding privileges.\nIf they are oversubscribed they\ncan ensure that only pupils of a\ncertain religion, or more precisely,\npupils with parents of a certain\nreligion, can attend. hey are also\nallowed to discriminate in the\nhiring of teaching sta\ufb00. Not just RE\nteachers; history teachers, science\nteachers, geography teachers... Such\ngrotesque discrimination would\nbe illegal in any other workplace\nexcept, of course, in a church. he\nprinciple of employing people\naccording to their ability is thrown\nout of the window.\nReligious schools are also deeply\nsocially divisive. Giving schools the\nability to select along arbitrary lines\nmeans they use this as an excuse to\nselect wealthier pupils. Middle class\nparents are more able to \u201cgame\u201d the\nsystem in knowing which religious\nbuttons to push and being more\nlikely to be free on Sundays to go to\nchurch. Remember I said that a third\nof state schools are religious? Of\nthe 20 most socially exclusive state\nschools in the UK (comparing pupils\nwho receive a free school meal to\nthose who do in the catchment\narea) 18, that\u2019s 90%, are religiously\nselective.\nLastly there is the issue of\npreventing children from mixing\nand meeting with children from\ndi\ufb00erent backgrounds of their own.\nPhilosopher A C Grayling likes to\nsay that the argument against faith\nschools can be summed up in two\nwords: Northern Ireland. I went to\na Catholic school in Belfast. Despite\nthis being a majority Protestant\ncity, I didn\u2019t meet a Protestant\nof my own age until I came to\nImperial, aged 18 (incidentally, he\nis now the editor of this paper).\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s devisions go\nmuch deeper than our schools but\nto argue that deliberately keeping\nthe two communities apart hasn\u2019t\ncontributed to tensions and lack\nof empathy between them is\nludicrous. In England, too, cultural\ntensions are heightened by \u201cfaith\nschools\u201d which can de facto select\naccording to race. he current\ngovernment allowing new Muslim\nand Evangelical Christian \u201cFree\nSchools\u201d can only be a recipe\nfor disaster when it comes to\nintegration.\nWhile my children won\u2019t be\nbrought up in any religion, I want\nto see them educated alongside\nJewish kids, Muslim kids,\nChristian kids, Sheikh kids and all\nother kinds of kids. I want their\nteachers to be the best teachers\nin their subjects, not the ones\nwho ticked the most denominational\nboxes. I want them to learn alongside\npoor kids and rich kids. I want them\nto be a part of their communities. For\nas long as we allow such desperately\ndivisive institutions as religious\nschools to operate, at the taxpayers\nexpense, this vision of education, this\nshared vision, is hopeless fantasy.\nReligious schools are an awful idea\nand an even worse reality. We are\nbetter o\ufb00 without them.\nEoghan J. Totten\n@eoghantotten\nComment Editor\nTotten:\n\u201cThese\nseeds of\nimperfection\nwere not\nsewn in the\nclassroom.\u201d\nFenton: \u201cWhile my\nchildren won\u02bct be\nbrought up in any\nreligion, I want to\nsee them educated\nalongside Jewish\nkids, Muslim kids,\nChristian kids,\nSheikh kids and\nall other kinds of\nkids.\u201d\n\n"

I strongly\nbelieved that good teachers were\nthe leaders of tomorrow and that\nthey were a key element to a strong\nsociety. Ask yourselves this question:\nWould you be here without the one\ninspirational teacher who believed\nin you and pushed you to the top? I\nknow that I would not. My parents\nmoved me around a lot when I was\nlittle and I was educated in French my\nwhole life. When they decided to put\nme in an International school aged\nsixteen - where the main language was\nEnglish - I started to give up on my big\ndreams of making it to a prestigious\nuniversity in France. I was convinced\nthat I would never have su\ufb03cient\ngrades to apply where I wanted (as\nmy English was really poor). My\nliterature teacher believed in me from\nthe start, pushing me to apply to even\nmore prestigious universities; they\nwere not the best in France. hey\nbelonged to the best in the world.\nHe was an exceptional teacher, the\nkind of person that does not look at\nyour academic record alone, seeing\nmuch more in you than a nondescript\nkid with \u2018such and such\u2019 grades.\nSomewhere along the line I grew\nup, became realistic and went o\ufb00 to\nuniversity convinced that I would\nend up working in a fancy corporate\nbank like my mother. I decided to\ngive up on my dream to become, one\nday, one of those inspirational people.\nDespite this, when you really\nbelieve in something, no matter how\nhard you try, you will never be able\nto push it away and pretend it does\nnot exist. I tried to forget about all\nthis until one day, when I met Sophia,\nthe Teach First graduate recruiting\no\ufb03cer on campus at the time. She\nseemed so passionate about her\njob and Teach First\u2019s vision that\nmy drive for teaching immediately\nresurfaced. Her message was simple:\nthe British education system is unfair\nand children with a disadvantaged\nbackground are clearly left behind\nothers who are more fortunate.\nI could drown you with numbers\nto support this claim but let me just\nleave you with a few notable statistics:\n16% of children eligible for free school\nmeals make it to university. Contrat\nthis with 96% of children coming from\nindependent schools! Really? Teach\nFirst\u2019s mission is to change those\nnumbers and turn around the current\nsituation. How do they do that? hey\nempower people like you and I to\ntake action and join their movement.\nhere are many ways in which\nyou can participate and make a\ndi\ufb00erence. You can become a Brand\nManager like me (and write articles\nabout your life at 10pm!), apply\nfor their Leadership Development\nProgramme (if you are into teaching\nor fancy working for their partners\nafter the programme...or both!).\nFurthermore, you can raise awareness\nof all of Teach First\u2019s good work.\nDo you want to change lives and make\nsocietybetter?Areyouinterestedinthe\ncorporate world but feel like you want\nto do something that takes pecedence?\nTake up the challenge. Teach First!\nIf you would like to find out\nmore about Teach First sign up\nto the Employer Presentation\non Monday 28th of October at 6\npm in he Read Lecture heatre,\nSher\ufb01eld Building via JobsLive.\nConfessions of a GTA: Part One\nI\u2019\nve always wanted to be a\nGTA. It wasn\u2019t because they\nwere doing amazing PhDs on\ntheir own desks, in which they\ncured cancer or published\nground-breaking articles which they\npresented at world conferences. his\nwas all pretty cool but actually, it had\na lot to do with them being rubbish\nat teaching. As an undergraduate I\nsaw them turn up late to lectures they\nwere being paid to help with, chat with\ntheir colleagues and completely ignore\nany student of a di\ufb00erent nationality\nfrom their own. hey would stand\nright behind you in an exam breathing\nheavily, or when questioned on\nhow to do the most impossible\nproblem conceived by man, they\nwould ask, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nI always thought that it was\nstartlingly clear that, at this point,\nbeing so confused and exasperated by\nthis stupid question, that all I cared\nabout was them telling me what I\nshould be thinking. If there was one\nthing I was going to get right on\nmy PhD it was being a good GTA.\nhus, on my \ufb01rst day I duly signed up\nforthemostappropriatecoursesformy\nskills which all commenced after the\ntraining dates. I carefully considered\nmy timetable so that I\u2019d have time to\nread through all the lecture notes and\ndo each tutorial from scratch.

At the centre of it all is\nthe impeccably dressed, wigged, and\nmade-up actress (they\u2019ve really gone\nall out in trying to match the appear-ance), who nails the (in)famous Panorama interview word for word, and really captures the essence of a woman\ntrapped, constantly hounded by the\npress who can\u2019t get enough shots of\nher, as well as her desire for helping\nthose in need and most importantly,\nfor this film, her search for love.\nIt\u2019s this love angle that puts such a\ndrab spin on the narrative, as her \u201clove\nat first sight\u201d with brilliant cardiotho-racic surgeon Hasnat Khan (Andrews,\nsurprisingly good) is played out in\nsuch ridiculous scenes of utmost unintentional hilarity that the film fails\nto sell a single thing it has to say about\nthe lovebirds who could have had it all\nhad it not been for Dr Khan\u2019s strong\ndisapproval and distaste towards the\nmedia invasion of his privacy. The romance\u2019s low-point comes when Diana\ncan\u2019t stop talking about how an actual\nhuman heart cannot really be broken.\nHilarity and embarrassment ensue.\nSudden awkward time-jumps play\nan important part in doing some shallow digging into the big achievements\nof Diana and her charity work, but\nthese scenes seem to serve the one\nsingle purpose of recreating some of\nthe famous pictures captured of the\nPrincess of Wales. Most notable is her\nwalk in the Angolan minefield - inspirational sure, but when it translates to\nthe film with very little context to back\nWhat kind of demons can parents\nreally turn into when something\nhappens to their children? According\nto Prisoners, Denis Villeneuve\u2019s new\ngritty, dark, and twisty thriller, anyone\npushed to the limit can be capable of\npretty much anything - which sends\nquite the chilling, disturbing message\nat the end of its lengthy 153-minute\nrunning time. The eternal question\nof \u201cWhat are we really capable of in\ndesperate circumstances?\u201d is explored\nhere, as a number of characters are\nthrown into impossible situations.\nIt was supposed to be an ordinary\nThanksgiving dinner for the Dover\nand Birch families. Keller (Jackman),\nGrace (Bello), Franklin (Howard) and\nNancy (Davis) are friends who get\ntogether for the annual celebration\nwith their children. However when\ntheir daughters disappear, it sends\neveryone into panic, then despair, as\neveryone unravels at the thought of the\nworst case scenario.\nAn obvious suspect is immediately\napprehended, a mentally stunted\nyoung man (Dano) who cannot be\ninterrogated fully due to his lack of\ngeneral understanding. Keller, not\nsatisfied with the limits of the law,\ndecides to take matters into his own\nhands, starting with kidnapping,\nthen imprisoning, swiftly moving to\nviolence and torture. The cold, grey\nsetting certainly help set the tone of\nwhat is to come, and what follows\nmatches up with the bleak build-up.\nInwhatmustbethebestperformance\nof his career so far, Jackman shines in\nthe lead as a regular family man gone\nwrong - as darkness takes over, his\npresence becomes more and more\ngripping by the frame, and if he could\nscore an Oscar nomination with Les\nMis, he certainly deserves one for his\nwork here.\nEqually effective is the rest of\nthe cast: Gyllenhaal, the fiery and\ndetermined detective who tries to\nkeep a clear perspective of what\u2019s\nlegal and what\u2019s not, Bello, Jackman\u2019s\nquietly grieving wife who looks sleep-deprived, Howard, one of the other\nfathers who reluctantly gets roped\ninto Keller\u2019s extreme methods, Davis,\nhis steely wife who encourages her\nhusband to look the other way when it\ncomes to what needs to be done, Dano,\nambiguous in the centre of the did-heor-didn\u2019t-he mystery, and Leo, as an\nelderly lady who knows more than she\nlets on.\nThe plot becomes more and more\ncomplicated as it goes on, and it\u2019s a\nshame the credibility of it all soon\ndrops along with it. The final reveal is\none that shocks but perhaps not quite\nfully explains.\nIt\u2019s not an easy film to watch by any\nmeans, and the film isn\u2019t afraid to show\nsome of the frank brutality displayed by\nthe characters, but this is one that will\nlinger in the mind and spark debates.\n\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d, \u201cWhat do they\ndeserve?\u201d will be interesting questions\nto answer after the credits start rolling.\nit all up, none of it feels as powerful as\nit should have done.\nThat\u2019s the problem with Diana. As\nmuch as everyone tries to give an intimate portrayal, it plays too safe and\nneat with the subject at hand, never\nsteering the narrative to more interesting territory. It goes through the\nlast two years of her life like a history\ntextbook, this happened, then a few\nmonths later this, then she made a\nspeech here etc - which explains why\nthe film feels as dull as reading one.\nPerhaps it is too soon to expect\nsomeone to properly tackle this internationally celebrated figure. There\nmust be a biopic underway, something\nlike My Week with Marilyn , not hugely ambitious timeline-wise, but a suitably poignant and sentimental exploration of an icon\u2019s life. This is sadly not\nthat film, and Watts has quite severely\nburned herself out of this year\u2019s Oscar\nrace with this one.\n\n"

In many ways\nthe concert hall is perfectly suited to\nJaar\u2019s delicate, jazz-infused melodies\nand masterful productions. Indeed,\nthe Barbican is no stranger to hosting musicians strongly rooted in the\nelectronic music sphere; the night before had seen Pantha du Prince grace\nthe stage. I was expecting an evening\nof Jaar\u2019s more laid-back music, hopefully with some guest musicians to \ufb01ll\nthe acoustic slots from Space is only\nNoise. For these regions, along with\nthe promise of a trippy accompanying\nlight show, I was hyped.\nhe night kicked o\ufb00 with support\nact, Evian Christ, weaving the audience through shifting clouds of ambient electronica. he visuals, projected\nonto a huge screen along the stage,\nadded the perfect ocular accompani-ment, entrancing much of the crowd.\nUnfortunately, after a while the audience began to get somewhat restless,\npresumably due to the lack of any beat\nto focus the mind. heir prayers may\nhave been answered in emphatic style\nwhen, halfway through his set, Evian\nChrist began laying the jungle and rap\nsamples on thick. For me, the whole\nthing was slightly too long, with the\naggressive drum and bass samples becoming jarring towards the end.\nAfter the interval, Jaar took to the\nstage and the performance was kicked\no\ufb00 by a young girl sporadically saying \u201cmama\u201d. After the slightly bizarre\nopening, she was whisked o\ufb00 and Jaar\nbegan.\nhe \ufb01rst half of his performance\nF\nwas a mixture of songs from Space is\nOnly Noise and other pieces that are\npresumably unreleased. Jaar manoeu-vred between his laptop, keyboard,\nmicrophone and, extremely brie\ufb02y, a\ngrand piano. Half-way through, the\nyoung girl returned to the stage with\nthree others to lend their vocal tal-ents. his was one of the highlights\nof the show, and it was a shame that\nmore musicians weren\u2019t present to\nadd an extra dimension to the perfor-mance.\nhe second part of Jaar\u2019s performance involved the guitarist and other half of the Darkside project, Dave\nHarrington. Together the two create\nmusic very much in line with Jaar\u2019s\nother productions, however Harrington\u2019s e\ufb00ects-laden guitar work\nde\ufb01nitely adds something new. he\nduo played a few tracks from their\nrecently-released record, Psychic.\nAMS album of the week\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e recently released\nher latest offering; a double album\nconsisting of two so-called \u201csuites\u201d,\nexpanding on the Metropolis conceptual series of her first two re-leases. After a rise in fame due to\nher barely-there feature on Fun.\u2019s\nabysmal hit \u2018We Are Young\u2019, The\nElectric Lady is a wonderful journey through the past, present and\nfuture of R&B, with a nice sprinkling of afrofuturist tinged inter-sectional feminism! Try saying that\nwith your mouth full.\nThe double album features R&B giants such as Prince and Erykah Badu\nas well as newcomers Miguel, Esperanza Spalding and Solange. Despite\nthis, each song remains entirely in Mon\u00e1e\u2019s domain, stylistically and lyrical-ly. However, The Electric Lady is less of an obvious concept album as with\n2010\u2019sThe ArchAndroid,andIfoundhadtodigdeepertofindthecontextof\nthe world within which Mon\u00e1e writes. Interspersed are the hilarious radio\nshow skits, which give further snippets of the man vs. android concept.\nA personal highlight of mine is Mon\u00e1e and Miguel\u2019s take on the traditional 90s slow jam \u2018Primetime\u2019, featuring a crafty and well utilised Pixies\nsample. It seems only fitting that the album has moments that harp back to\nthe classic \u2018Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\u2019, as Hill has just been released from\nprison for tax-evasion. Even \u2018Electric Lady\u2019 sounds just like a TLC song, if\nTLC was two parts Mon\u00e1e and one part Solange.\n\u2018Ghetto Woman\u2019 is perhaps the only low point of The Electric Lady. I think\nthe jumbled Stevie Wonder-esque production really lets the song down, as\nthe lyrical content is socially significant. Aside from this, the production\nwork courtesy of funk act \u2018Deep Cotton\u2019 is pretty awesome.\nI have so much more to say about this great double album, but I\nreally recommend you give it a listen. \u201cWhat an Experience\u201d indeed.\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e \u2013 The Electric Lady\nYasmin Malik\nhroughout the show a team\nof visual artists worked behind the\nscreen, projecting analogue visual de-lights. Di\ufb00erent e\ufb00ects, such as projections of mixing coloured oils with\nwater, were layered upon one another\ncreating an authentically analogue and\nunique visual experience. his was\ngood, as watching a man play with his\nlaptop and \ufb01ddle with a keyboard isn\u2019t\nparticularly entrancing.\nBy the encore people had been\nteased enough and (myself included)\nwanted to dance. Gradually the crowd\nstood up and danced as well they could\nbetween rows of seats and to one of\nJaar\u2019s less danceable numbers. Just as\nthe crowd were really getting into it and\nanticipation was growing for a \ufb01nale\nthat would transform the Barbican into\na club, the performance ended. Disappointment was fairly tangible.\nAnd this was my problem with\nthe concert; Jaar neither performed\nhis more delicate work at its\u2019 expansive best - with live instruments; nor\ndid he whip the crowd up enough to\nturn the Barbican into a dance \ufb02oor.\nInstead, I was sat in some middle\nground, with my leg frantically tapping the beat and wondering how\ngood it could have been had Nicolas\nJaar stuck to one or the other.\nNo Age descended on North London last week to showcase their new\nalbum, \u201cAn Object\u201d. he LA two piece\nwere originally scheduled to play at\nKoko but the gig was downsized to\nthe school hall-esque Dome in Tufnell\nPark. his is de\ufb01nitely a band on the\nway down. he new album, unlike its\npredecessors, has received little hype\nand a fair amount of criticism. I think\na lot of the criticism is over the top,\nbut the live performance doesn\u2019t exactly help my point. here\u2019s no energy\nin any of the new stu\ufb00, and there is a\nlot of uninspiring shoegazey bollocks.\nhe lack of drums on a lot of\ntracks takes all momentum out of the\nsongs in the live arena and, perhaps\neven more importantly, Dean Spunt\ncannot sing for shit. hat\u2019s all \ufb01ne\nwhen you\u2019re belting out noisey punk\nclassics, but without the raw energy\nit just doesn\u2019t \ufb01t. Luckily, they still\nbrought out some of the noisey punk\nclassics. \u201cEraser\u201d and \u201cTeen Creeps\u201d\nwere met with rapturous approval by\na suddenly energetic crowd and old\nfavourite \u201cBoy Void\u201d went down a\ntreat too.\nhe undoubted highlight of the\nnight for me was a storming performance of \u201cFever Dreaming\u201d that left\nme almost dead (freshers' \ufb02u and\nenergetic gig going are not compat-ible) but damn happy about it. No\nAge de\ufb01nitely still have the ability to\nentertain live, it\u2019s just a shame they\ndon\u2019t write the songs to do it any\nmore.\nListen to music? Dance to\nmusic? Sing music?

    "content": "23\nFRIDAY 11 OCT\nTELEVISION\nEmily Fulham Television Editor\nDark Days in Downton Abbey\nLatest episode demonstrates how not to tackle a rape storyline\nAt the beginning of this week\u2019s\nDownton Abbey, there was a\nwarning for \u201cviolent scenes\nwhich some viewers may \ufb01nd\nupsetting\u201d, leading me to wonder\nwhat the cause could possibly be.\nGiven the most signi\ufb01cant crisis\nthus far this season has been a\nmatter of inheritance tax, it was\ndi\ufb03cult to imagine anything\ntoo disturbing: an emergency\nover the spillage of hot tea,\nperhaps? A tear in Lady Mary\u2019s\ndress which leaves her unable to\nmeet some viscount or another?\nYet after an otherwise standard\nepisode, featuring a tense\nscene involving a misplaced\ngramophone, and a truly heart-stopping moment in which a\nfootman drops a jam jar, the \ufb01nal\nfew minutes depicted a fairly\ngraphic rape scene. As the rest of\nthe household sits watching an\nopera singer perform, downstairs,\nladies\u2019 maid Anna is dragged\nscreaming by her hair, and raped\nby a guest servant staying the\nhouse. It isn\u2019t an easy scene to\nwatch, but it was more than just\nthe content of the scene that left\nme feeling uneasy, leaving me\nto question whether storylines\nsuch as these really have a place\nin a show like Downton Abbey.\nRegular viewers of Downton will\nknow that it has a track record of\nmaking miserable things happen\nto its characters. he third series\nhad one of the main characters\ndying in childbirth, which was\nshortly followed by the Christmas\nspecial in which the heir to the\nestate is killed in a car crash whilst\nhis wife is giving birth (the take-away message being, apparently,\ndon\u2019t get pregnant in Downton).\nEven Anna\u2019s character has already\nhad her fair share of di\ufb03culties,\nwith her husband Bates being sent\nto prison for a crime he didn\u2019t\ncommit, so perhaps this latest\ntwist shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise.\nHowever, storylines about rape\nhave become something of a lazy\nplot device, an easy way to shock\naudiences and get viewers talking.\nI\u2019m not suggesting that the\nsubject of rape shouldn\u2019t be\ntacked in TV programmes.\nOnly, it has to be handled with\na degree of care and sensitivity\nabove most other topics, given\nthat a not-insigni\ufb01cant number\nof viewers will have been a\ufb00ected\nto some degree, and I\u2019m not sure\nDownton, which is little more\nthan a glori\ufb01ed period soap\nopera, is best placed to do that.\nhe thing is, there\u2019s no way\nof dealing with the issue with\nthe gravitas it warrants, whilst\nalso following the otherwise\nmundane storylines in the show.\nNo matter how much it likes\nto pretend otherwise, Downton\nisn\u2019t a gritty, high-brow drama. It\ngained its fans through the willthey-won\u2019t-they romance of Lady\nMary and middle-class solicitor\nMatthew, the sharp witticisms\nof Lady Grantham (played by a\nfantastic Maggie hatcher), and\nthe glorious fashions of the early\ntwentieth century. It\u2019s therefore\nnot surprising that viewers were\nshocked after the episode aired on\nSunday evening; ITV apparently\nreceived over 60 complaints\nregardingthescene,withheadlines\nabout the episode appearing in\nmany newspapers the next day.\nhe fallout from the rape will\npresumably be one of the themes\nof this series, with Anna so far\ndetermined to keep her assault a\nsecret from her husband, fearing\nhe will be sent back to prison\nif he attempts to take revenge.\nAlthough it\u2019s too early to tell, it\u2019s\nnot a stretch to imagine that the\nmain purpose of Anna\u2019s rape will\nbe to add a new source of drama\nto the show, in particular to force\na confrontation between her\nhusband and her rapist. his sits\neven more uncomfortably when\nconsidering the other storylines\nof the series so far, which\ninclude Lord Grantham being\ncondescending to his daughter by\nexpressing doubt in her ability to\nmanage the estate, and the Abbey\u2019s\nyoungest resident, Rose, portrayed\nas \ufb02ighty and reckless after daring\nto dance with a man before asking\nhis name. Sometimes, Downton\nveers dangerously between\nevoking a rose-tinted nostalgia\nfor \u2018the olden days\u2019 and pointing\nout, heavy-handed, at how far\nwe\u2019ve come since then. It\u2019s easy,\nwhilst watching, to get a self-congratulatory sense of \u2018but look\nhow things have changed\u2019 (see\nalso: Mad Men), and yet rape,\nsexism and debates over women\u2019s\nsexuality are hardly issues\nrelegated to the past. And there\u2019s\nenough gratuitous rape in \u2018edgy\u2019\ndrama as is, without the likes\nof Downton deciding to join in.\nFor once, there appears to be\na consensus that, this time, the\nwriters have gone too far. It seems\nthis may be a misstep from the\nshow\u2019s creator, Julian Fellowes;\nby attempting to be hard-hitting\nand controversial, the show has\nalienated its core viewers. It will\nbe for them to decide whether\nthe show is worth saving, but\nuntil then, let\u2019s hope Fellowes\nhas learned from his mistake.\nWoman dies in childbirth: just another cheery day at the Abbey\nWoman dies in childbirth: just another cheery day at the Abbey\nEditors: John Park, Emily\nFulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

However,\nonly 2 airlines have signed up for the\npre-departure screenings which are\nessential for such a system to work.\nhe scheme was meant to track the\nmovement of 100% of the passengers\nmoving in or out of Britain but only\nmanages to track about 65% of such\npassengers. To ensure the movement\nof terrorists and other non-state\nactors, the tracking of all passengers\nis essential. he report also expanded\nupon the \u2018poor quality of data\u2019\ncollected from the e-borders system.\nhe UK Border Agency is said to be\nthe most technologically advanced in\nEurope but has clearly shown areas\nwhere improvement is necessary.\nhe main reason for lack of data\ncollection is said to be because of a lack\nof tracking on European routes.

US defence\nsecretary, Chuck Hagel, commended\nthe raid and stated that this showed\nhow America would spare \u2018no e\ufb00ort\nto hold terrorists accountable\u2019.\nhe family of Al-Liby, however,\ncalls the raid \u2018an act of piracy\u2019. hey\nsay that when Abu was coming\nback from Morning Prayer, he was\nmet with \u2018at least 10 men\u2019. hese\nmen allegedly were Libyan and had\nforcibly put this man in a \u2018white\nMercedes\u2019. hey also demand that if\nAl-Liby has done something wrong\nthen he should be prosecuted within\nLibya itself. he Libyan government\nappears to have had no knowledge\nabout this raid and asked for further\nexplanation from the White House.\nHowever, the chances of a\nprosecution in Libyan soil seem bleak.\nA spokesperson from the BBC stated\nthat he was being \u2018lawfully\u2019 detained\nunder the \u2018law of war\u2019 in a secure\nlocation outside Libya. He is also being\nprosecuted in the New York court for\nthe 1998 bombings, which has caused\nthe likelihood of his release from the\nUS authorities to be very low indeed.\nhe Libyan government, however,\nfeels that this event will not erode\nrelationships between Libya and the\nUS. One leading spokesperson from\nthe ruling party stated that the US\nplayed a key role in the revolution and\ntherefore feel that this event would\nnot deteriorate relationships. He also\nadded that although the maintenance\nof relationships was important, the\nsafety and security of the Libyan\ncitizens was of greater importance.\nhisraidhasangeredterroristgroups\nwho have asked for some retaliation.\nLibya intensi\ufb01es\npressure on USA:\nHamid Karzai criticizes\nNATO forces:\nNATO combat forces are planning to\nleave Afghanistan in 2014.

However, President\nHamid Karzai claims that not only have\nthe NATO forces been ineffective but\nhave in fact ended up being damaging\nfor the country. He claimed that the\nNATO had a role to play in the loss of\nlife of Afghan people. He further stated\nthat he did not want a partial victory\nover terrorism but a \u2018clear-cut\u2019 war on\nterror. In the same interview he also said\nthat he would open talks with the Al\nQaeda, as they are also Afghan citizens.\nThis view, however, has brought\nforward criticism from people around\nthe world.

And of\ncourse I must not forget to welcome the freshers who\nwill be joining this brilliant institution and especially\nthe scientists who are lucky enough to be part of the\nbest constituent union on campus. Whether you are\nold or new, everyone loves a good welcome letter.\nFor those that do not know, the RCSU is one of the\nfour constituent unions at Imperial and was founded\nby famous Sci-\ufb01 writer H.G. Wells in 1881. We exist\nfor two reason; social activities and representation.\nRepresentation wise, we have o\ufb03cers that look after\nstudent welfare to help you even out any bumps you\nhit during university. here are also year reps and\ndepartmental reps who keep the lecturers on their\ntoes to ensure you get the world class education you\ndeserve. he Year rep nominations are currently open\nand I would urge the keener ones amongst to get\neveryone\u2019s voice heard and stand for election.\nUniversity is of course more than just about a degree\nand we organize a range of social events such as our\nseasonal balls, bar nights, pub crawls, guest lectures\nand an essay-writing competition called the RCSU\nScience Challenge which boasts a prize pot over \u00a34k.\nhis year, I am also looking to revive RCS Sports\nclubs, rugby and football in particular. I am hoping\nthat we can re-ignite some of our old rivalries and\nput the various trophies behind the union bar up\nfor competition again. If this is something you are\ninterested in, please e-mail the RCSU Sports O\ufb03ce\nOscar Farrell at Oscar.farrell12@imperial.ac.uk.\nEnd of the day, university is what you make of it. he\nrelationship between the union and its member is a\ntwo-way one. If you don\u2019t put some energy in, you are\nunlikely to get a lot out of it. So, get to know the union\no\ufb03cers, come to the RCSU o\ufb03ce for my weekly drop-ins and check what we are up to on www.rcsu.org.\nuk. Our website is currently being re-designed by our\nwebmaster Philip Kent and we hope to get an all new\ninteractive site rolled out in the near future.\nhe best way to keep in touch is to read my e-mails\nand newsletters as they will be full of important tidbits\nabout what\u2019s happening and the opportunities we\nprovide for you. I swear they won\u2019t be as boring as they\nsound!\nHere\u2019s to an amazing year,\nPlabon Saha\nRCSU President\nS\nomeone told me today\nthat you shouldn\u2019t write\nreviews of your own events.\nI obviously didn\u2019t listen to\ntheir advice; after all, who\ncan know better what went down at\nthe RCSU events than people within\nthe RCSU?! My sincerest apologies\nto the other constituent unions\nwho are obviously lagging behind.\nFreshers Fair:\nhree words. Wheel of Fortune. You\nknow how Nando\u2019s always has a prize\nwheel at the freshers\u2019 fairs? Well, this\nyear they weren\u2019t the only one as we\nhired in a massive plasma screen and\nran our own giant wheel of fortune.\nPrizes included Autumn Ball tickets,\ndrink tokens, an 8GB RCSU USB stick,\npint glasses, shot glasses, mugs, RCSU\nlapel badges and RCSU Scarves. Given\nthe crowd at our table throughout the\nday, it\u2019s fair to say the gimmick was\nmore than successful, especially when\nthe CGCU - who were opposite us -got so mad at their empty stand they\nhad to keep shouting to attract people.\nTo top that miserable day o\ufb00 for them,\nwe also nicked the Spanner and Bolt!\nWe also had tons of RCSU sweets\nfor the masses alongside lanyards,\nnotepads and the highlight of them\nall, RCSU condom cases. hese\ndouble up as a key ring and are a\ndiscreet way of making sure you are\nalways prepared. We were very happy\nto see so many eager faces on the day\nand are looking forward to seeing\nyou all again in this coming year.\nRCSU Made in Chelsea Pub Crawl:\nWe started Freshers\u2019 Fortnight o\ufb00 on\nhursday the 3rd with our trademark\nMade in Chelsea pub crawl. As always,\nour beloved 1916 Dennis N-Type \ufb01re\nengine Jezebel was there to transport\nfreshers from pub to pub. Some would\nsayitwasquiteanexpensivepubcrawl,\nbut with student loan cash spilling\nover in everyone\u2019s pockets, there was\nhardly a problem with \u00a34 pints for a\nnight. he night ended at JUJU\u2019s, a\ncocktail bar on King\u2019s Street to end\nthe night on a high. At one point,\nMIC stars showed up and decided to\nbuy everyone drinks at the ba- wait,\nnever mind, that might have been\nme on a di\ufb00erent night out. Oops.\nRCSU Bookshop:\nOn Friday morning with hangovers\nin full force, we set up the RCSU\nsecond hand bookshop in Sher\ufb01eld\nFoyer. he bookshop was an excellent\nopportunity for students to buy\nsecond hand books from other\nstudents at a reasonable price. After\na big rush in the morning the rest of\nthe day was spent quietly behind the\nstand by various committee members.\nRumour has it that someone started\nto eat their own hands in boredom.\nRCSU Tea Party:\nhe second week of Freshers started\no\ufb00 in a truly British manner with the\nRCSU Tea Party. here were various\ntypes of tea on o\ufb00er which were\nprocured from a specialised tea house.\nWith free scones and cakes on o\ufb00er it\nwasofnosurprisethattherewasagreat\nanticipation amongst students. In fact,\na queue built up before the start of the\nparty and hoards of scientists piled in\nas soon as the doors were open. Union\njacks were \ufb02ying high and the tea\nkept \ufb02owing as people relaxed after\na day of lectures. Even if they weren\u2019t\nawake for lectures, the tea ensured\ntheir evening got o\ufb00 to a good start.\nRCSU Autumn Ball:\nPerhaps the most prized event of\nthem all was the RCSU Autumn\nBall which took place on Tuesday\nat Ruby Blue in Leicester Square.\nhere were 3 free double mixers on\no\ufb00er alongside a scoop of nitrogen\nice cream. he Ball managed to sell\nout a day in advance and there was\ngreat anguish amongst the people\nwho missed out on the tickets. But\nfor the people who managed to grab\nhold of one before time ran out, they\nwere in for a treat. he nitrogen ice\ncream proved to be very successful as\nevident by the long queues that were\nforming. Some would say that the\nice cream was so good, it made them\ncompletely forget about the hardships\nof grinding a degree out of Imperial.\nPriced competitively at \u00a312, the ball\nwas organized to ensure it doesn\u2019t\ncut a deep hole in people\u2019s pockets.\nStudent drink prices were in full\n\ufb02ow to ensure that even the hard\nboozers were kept satis\ufb01ed. It was a\nperfect night for the awkward one\nnight stands during freshers to turn\ninto a full blown romance. Near\nthe end, Black Eyed Peas showed\nup and started singing. Maybe.\n\u201cI\u02bcve had the time of my life\nAnd I\u02bcve never felt this way before\nAnd I swear this is true\nAnd I owe it all to RCSU\u201d.\nFamily Bar Night:\nIn RCSU, it\u2019s all about community and\nto ensure the sense of community is\nfully integrated amongst the incoming\nfreshers, a family bar night was held at\nthe Union Bar on hursday the 10th.\nWith free drinks on o\ufb00er for people in\ntheir families, some hardcore family\nbonding was de\ufb01nitely on the cards.\nIt is de\ufb01nitely a great start to the year\nfor us and it\u2019s bound to get better.\nRCSU Freshers Fortnight: Legit\nreview from the RCSU Office\nRCSU\nTOP: Jezebel, the RCSU\u02bcs Mascot; BOTTOM: RCSU Committee Members\n\u201cRCS What?\nWe don\u02bct know\nwho you are!\u201d\nIf this resonates\nstrongly with\nyou, you are\neither a) an\nengineer, or\nb) in need of a\nfriend\n\u201cRCS Ha!\u201d You\nsay?

You\nhave never heard of Felix and you are\nnot sitting here reading this article.\nWhat a dream. No dull lectures, ridiculously di\ufb03cult coursework, or seemingly un-passable exams.

According to UNESCO, this\nis the reality for 57 million primary\nschool-aged and 69 million lower\nsecondary school-aged children as of\n2011 around the world. here are huge\ne\ufb00orts to try and get these \ufb01gures\ndown to 0, but it is still a long way o\ufb00.\nIt is di\ufb03cult to identify the contribution that each barrier has on impeding these children\u2019s rights to educa-tion. Nevertheless, this is not a reason\nto sit back and wait for the statistics to\n\ufb02ow in before we make a move.\nIn line with the Millennium Development Goal that \u201cby 2015, children\neverywhere will be able to complete\na full course in primary schooling\u201d,\nand even beyond, charities all over the\nworld are working to change the current situation.\nOne example is the Paraguayan\nFoundation for Cooperation and Development an organisation which aids\nschools in Latin America to improve\naccess to education for young people.\nBy showing the San Francisco school\nin Paraguay that they do not need to\nsolely depend on external sources of\nincome, the Foundation has managed\nto facilitate it from being previously\ndependent on decreasing government\nsubsidies and facing high dropout\nrates. he San Francisco School is now\na 100% self-su\ufb03cient model that was\nable to generate $300,000 in \ufb01ve years.\nHow? he solution, when expressed\naloud, seems so simple and obvious \u2013\nsuccessful school businesses!\nhanks to this approach, students\nat the San Francisco School pay only\n$10 a month in fees.

In this global business planning\ncompetition, schools are guided during the \ufb01rst stage to think of a business\nidea and write business and \ufb01nancial\nplans.

    "content": "GAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 FRIDAY 11 OCT\nMax Eggl\nGames Editor\nEver wanted to take part into a\ncontinent wide battle for control\nof an entire planet? PlanetSide\n2 (released November 2012) the\nrevamp of the succesful MMOFPS\nPlanetSide allows you to do exactly\nthat! It revolves around the control\nof the mysterious planet of Auraxis.\nFeaturing a gigantic map, which\nis divided into hexagonal areas\nwhere the three di\ufb00erent factions\nvie for control. While in e\ufb00ect you\ncan spawn anywhere on the three\ncontinents, you will only be wanting\nto spawn in to where the actual action\nis taking place. his is easily done\nusing the direct spawn in (which has\na 2 minute cooldown), or spawning in\nfrom your local base. his allows for\nquick entry to gaming which is quite\nsatisfying. he maps themselves are\nbeautifully crafted and even on the\nlowest settings, quite detailed. his\nmakes \ufb02ying, driving or just walking\nthrough the world very enjoyable.\nWhen joining the game for the\nLike a good meal, steak as the main and planets on the side\n\ufb01rst time, you are confronted with\na choice of a faction that you will\nrepresent. here are the Terran\nRepublic (the industrial faction,\nwhich uses bullets and heavy metal\nstu\ufb00), the New Conglomerate (a\nfreedom \ufb01ghter faction, using a\nmish mash of technologies) and\nthe Vanuu Sovereignty (the high\ntech faction, which utilise laser and\nplasma tech). While gampeplay\nis virtually the same within the\nthree factions, the developers\nhave made enough changes to\nlook and feel, that you do feel like\nthere is a signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence.\nhe di\ufb00erent classes themselves are\nalso really fun, and each individual\none makes for a completely di\ufb00erent\ngaming experience. I myself\npreferred the Light Assault class\ndue to the addition of the pretty\nuseful jetpack! However due to the\nmodi\ufb01ability of each weapon and\nability, it is possible to play one class\nalmost like another and do so quite\nsuccessfully. he most fun class is the\nMAX class, which is basically a Iron\nman type suit which you can add\ndi\ufb00erent loadouts to. his suit is quite\noverpowered, meaning that if you do\nit right you can mow down enemies!\nhe gunplay in this game is quite\nrealistic, meaning that for the bullet\nbased guns you will have to account\nfor gravity and the like (however\nthe laser based tech of the Vanuu\ndoes not have this factor). However\nI found that due to the size of the\nmap as well as the large amount of\npeople on the server at the time\nthat it was actually quite laggy. hat\nmeant at some points I would die\neven after I had killed my opponent.\nhis was very frustrating, and even\nsetting the graphics settings to the\nlowest didnt seem to solve that\nproblem. I really hope that this is\nsolved soon as possible, because\nwhen the game play is actually\nlag-free it is really good and fun.\nHowever there are pros to there\nbeing so many players on the server.\nSince this game is a multiplayer\ngame, there is the reasonable\nexpectation that you will be spending\nquite a bit of time playing online with\nothers. Howevever it is perfectly \ufb01ne\nplaying solo, and it will not really\nimpact your gaming experience. On\nthe other hand, it is when you join\na squad that stu\ufb00 goes really well.\nUsually you will be added to a squad\non a random basis (e.g. some random\ndude will invite you to join a squad),\nand the quality of them can vary but\nwhen it goes well, it goes really well!\nhis game follows the fremium\nmodel, meaning that you can play\nfor free, however have to pay for\nadditional content. he developers\nhave pledged that you will not be\ndisadvantaged if you do not pay, as\nthe content that costs is for the most\npart cosmetic/time saving. At no\npoint in the game did I really feel that\nI needed to pay money, and it did\nnot really hamper my ability to play.\nhis is a well crafted game that\nis quite fun, and the fact that you\ncan enjoy the most of it for free is\nexcellent. If you are a fan of Halo\ntype games, you should really look\ninto this. I mean, you might as well!\nhe Lara Croft we see in this game is\nvery di\ufb00erent to how we might usually\nperceive her: con\ufb01dent, strong,\ncomfortable with diving into dark\ncaves or putting bullets into enemies.\nInstead, our main character starts\no\ufb00 as anxious, afraid and averse to\nviolence. his game takes us back to\nthe beginning of the metamorphosis\nfrom Lara Croft to the Tomb Raider.\nInitially the game has cinematic\nscripted sequences that can be\nfrustrating to sit through with\nminimal involvement, but it sets\nthe scene very well and allows you\nto understand that you are about\nto play a very di\ufb00erent game to the\none you might have expected. Lara\nis attacked, stabbed, exposed to the\nharsh elements and the game focuses\non her pain and fear. She shivers,\nsobs, and throws up as she tries her\nbest to survive her situation, and this\nmakes her more than a character in a\ngame. It makes her human, and our\nsympathy goes out to her. If you fail,\nthere are graphic and gory sequences\nof her death, further increasing\nyour incentive\nto keep\nher alive.\nHowever, as\nyou play on she becomes stronger,\nboth emotionally and physically,\nand the game slowly turns into a\nmore familiar adventure that is\nexhilarating, albeit a little typical.\nWeapon and skills upgrades are\ntranslatable into good advantages\nin gameplay, and not prohibitively\ndifficult to acquire. Traversing the\nareas is fast-paced, and \ufb01nding\n\u2018tombs\u2019 where you can solve puzzles\nand earn goodies is rewarding\nand fun. he main downsides to\ngameplay are the occasional times\nwhere you do not\nhave total\ncontrol of Lara\nduring certain\nscenes,\nand feel like\nyou\u2019re just\nholding the\ncontroller\nwhile the\nscript\nplays\nout.\nSecond, the\n\u2018survival\ninstincts\u2019\nmode\nwhere interactive objects are\nhighlighted take some of the\nfun out of the game as you\nimmediately\nknow where\nto go and can piece\ntogether solutions to\npuzzles without much\nthought (though it is\noptional).\nhe graphics and cinematics\nof the game are beautiful.\nhere are a multitude of\ncaches, documents and\nrelics scattered\naround the areas and it\u2019s\nactually a visual\npleasure to look\nfor them. hey also help\nbring out the archaeological side\nof Lara Croft, which is who she is at\nheart, even from the beginning of\nthe game. he overall plot of Tomb\nRaider is also fairly engaging, though\nthe supporting cast are not quite as\nwell-developed as Lara (something\nthe game attempts to \ufb01x by having\nLara randomly \ufb01nding letters that\nreveal their back-stories).\nhe completion of the story is\nas anticipated, and not entirely\nsatisfying.

    "content": "19\nFRIDAY 11 OCT\nFILM\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nBFI London Film Festival\nRoz (Wright) and Lil (Watts) are best\nfriends. Roz\u2019s son Tom (Frencheville)\nand Lil\u2019s son Ian (Samuel) are also\nbest friends. So far so good right?\nNow here\u2019s where it gets weird. Ian\nstarts sleeping with Roz first. Then\nTom starts sleeping with Liz. Yes, the\ntwo female best friends are engaged\nin romantic relationships with each\nother\u2019s sons. It doesn\u2019t take long for\nthem to find out about all of this, and\neven when they do, their reactions are\nshockingly tame. They don\u2019t mind,\nas they want each other to be happy,\nwhich is fine for now, but we all know\nthis arrangement is one that cannot\npossibly have a happy ending\u2026 right?\nMore definitely so since Roz is actually\nmarried.\nBut the way everything keeps its\npeace and quiet for quite some time is\nwhat\u2019s remarkable. The four of them\nare still as chummy as ever, and it\u2019s\nback to their old routines of going to\nthe beach; the two beautiful mothers\nlying in the sand soaking up the sun,\nand the two good-looking sons going surfing, exactly the same picture\nthey\u2019ve been painting over the years.\nAnd for a good hour the pair of relationships goes on without a single\nnoticeable hitch. And with the four\nactors sharing convincing enough\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nAdore\nDirector: Anne Fontaine\nWriters: Christopher Hampton,\nAnne Fontaine, Doris Lessing (novel)\nStarring: Naomi Watts, Robin\nWright, James Frencheville, Xavier\nSamuel\nRuntime: 100 minutes\nCertification: R (USA)\nchemistry, it\u2019s easy to buy into their\nlove, despite how inappropriate and\npreposterous it all may have seemed\nat the start.\nHaving spent so much time on how\nhappy they are, there is an ill-placed\ntime-jump that fast-forwards two\nyears of their lives in which we find\nthat they\u2019re still hopelessly in love and\ndevoted. With hardly any details or\nsignificant happenings to back this all\nup, the narrow scope through which\nwe view the characters does limit how\nmuch of this the audience can actually\nfind believable.\nAll good things must come to an end\nhowever, after more than an hour or\nso, leaving only 40 minutes to come\nto some kind of conclusion for this\ncomplicated situation. Reality sinks\nin for the characters, and one sensible\nperson of the group decides to call it\nquits. What looked so picturesque\nand felt perfect as the four of them\nfrolicked on the beach not caring for\none moment about real-life problems,\nmust finish on a bitter note as the film\nto moves forward. But what should\nhave been the most intriguing part\nof the story turns into a surprisingly\ndry and tepid re-treading of familiar themes for a film that started out\nboldly in its opening.\nThere\u2019s jealousy, younger women\ninvolved, some weddings, and even\nan introduction of a new generation.\nThe mothers officially become grand-mothers. Even all this however, can\u2019t\nliven up the drama or inject any passion to the narrative. It gets more and\nmore ridiculous as the film refuses to\naddress the uncomfortable questions\nin the room, instead showing us endless pretty scenes at the beach that\nstart to have less meaning the more\nwe visit the same thing over and over\nagain. The fact they all remain age-defying is one of many distracting fea-tures, as well as the continued use of\nthe aforementioned time-jumps that\nbreaks any fluidity in the storytelling.\nMuch like what everyone goes\nthrough in the film, the audience may\nfind themselves hooked and intrigued\nin the beginning, only to be left disappointed and empty towards the\nend. The actresses in particular give\nit their all, in playing the indecisive\nwomen of a certain age who simply try\nto embrace love and life for what they\nare, but there is simply not enough\ngoing on here to keep you interested\nthroughout the entire film, which is a\nshame, given the highly unexpected,\nunique nature of the film\u2019s core romance plot.\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nThe Spectacular Now\nDirector: James Ponsoldt\nWriters: Scott Neustadter, Michael\nH. Weber, Tim Tharp (novel)\nStarring: Miles Teller, Shailene\nWoodley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kyle\nChandler\nRuntime: 95 minutes\nCertification: R (USA)\nHere is a delightfully charming highschool drama in which the characters talk, think, and look like teenag-ers. Every now and then we are lucky\nenough to be treated to some excellent films that involve coming-of-age\nstories (Clueless, 10 Things I Hate\nAbout You, Mean Girls, Easy A), so it\nwas about time we had another one of\nthese, and The Spectacular Now certainly fits the bill.\nIt starts with Sutter (Teller) having\nto do what all high-school students\nmust dread: the college application es-say. He\u2019s supposed to write about any\ndifficulties and hardship he\u2019s faced in\nlife. With plenty of examples to give,\nhe starts typing away, giving us plenty\nof humourous insight into his life that\nhas so far been far from ordinary.\nHe thinks he\u2019s happy with his current\ngirlfriend, and he thinks she\u2019s happy\ntoo, until he finds that she\u2019s been going to parties without him and instead\nwith the high-school quarterback. Already quite the big fan of booze and\nhaving a constant light buzz wherever\nhe goes (he has a handy little metallic flask he carries with him), Miles\ngoes through one night of particular\ndrunken debauchery that ends with\nhim passing out on a stranger\u2019s front\nyard, to be awoken the next morning\nby Aimee (Woodley).\nSo now the boy\u2019s met the girl - and\nthe subsequent development of their\nrelationship is quite simply the most\nadorable thing you\u2019re likely to see this\nyear. It naturally progresses from a\nslightly awkward friendship stemming\nfrom the boy\u2019s need to have geometry\nexplained to him, to something more,\nthen to a more romantic one, with first\nkiss, sex, the prom, planning for the\nfuture, all thrown in there.\nAlso helping are the spot-on performances by the two young actors who\nappear so natural and comfortable in\ntheir roles. Every minute they\u2019re to-gether, they seem to be enjoying each\nother\u2019s presence, as is the audience.\nThey laugh, share jokes and family\nstories as they bond, and every minute of their blossoming romance feels\nheart-warmingly genuine.\nYes, family is another aspect that\nplays an important part in fully drawing out Miles\u2019 character. Raised by his\nsingle mother who works as a nurse\n(Jason Leigh) and isn\u2019t always necessarily there, he wonders where his\nfather may be and what he\u2019s getting\nup to. Finding his father, and having a\ndecent conversation is what he longs\nfor, and when he does turn up in the\nform of a scruffy-looking Kyle Chandler, the result is far from something\nhe wanted. The adults surrounding\nMiles, including Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his married older sister who\nhe barely sees, all pitch in brilliant\nperformances that further shape the\nfilm with touching drama.\nAside from being told that she has\nan overbearing mother who wants\nher daughter around forever to help\nwith her newspaper route job, Aimee\u2019s\nfamily life is talked about but barely\nseen, an aspect which should have\nbeen explored more, to give an even\nbalance in the two leads.\nThe bittersweet nostalgia of having to grow up and face the world out\nthere is the inevitable theme the film\nmust address, as Miles is quite happy\nenough sitting back and relaxing in\nhis little town that everyone else cannot wait to leave behind. It\u2019s of course\na familiar message we\u2019ve seen many\ntimes before, but ending the film is a\nbrilliant closing montage with an effective voiceover from Sutter, beautifully weaving together everything he\u2019s\nlearned over the course of the film\u2019s\nrunning time, which is plenty.\n\n"

Punchdrunk\u2019s founder, Felix\nBarrett, became an early champion\nof \u2018promenade theatre\u2019 when he\nfounded the company in 2000, and\nsince then they have been taking over\nabandoned buildings, making visitors\ndon black masks, and leaving a trail of\nglowing reviews in their wake.\nhe Punchdrunk formula is a\nrelatively simple one; a building\nis converted into an interactive\ntheatrical space, and visitors are\ninvited to wander around, explore\nthe environment, and - driven by\ntheir curiosity - discover what has\nhappened. In this case, the company\ninhabit an abandoned Royal Mail\nsorting o\ufb03ce just outside Paddington\nStation, and have transformed it into\n\u2018Temple Studios\u2019, a 1960s \ufb01lm studio\nwith a sinister underbelly. Stripped of\ntheir belongings - phones and cameras\nare forbidden - visitors are given\nmasks that obscure their identity\nbefore entering the service lift, and\nbeing taken down into the bowels of\nthe \ufb01lm studio.\n\u201cThe company stress\nthat The Drowned\nMan is a show that\nshould be explored\nalone - whether by\nchoice or by force\u201d\nhe \ufb01rst surprise comes before\nwe have even left the elevator, as the\nattendant splits our group into two,\ndropping half o\ufb00 at one \ufb02oor, and\ntaking the rest of us to another level.\nhe company stress that he Drowned\nMan is a show that should be explored\nalone - whether by choice or by force.\nOnce we have been freed from the\nelevator we are allowed to wander\naround their creation. One half of the\nbuilding is made up to look like the\ntown around the studios, including a\nforest, a saloon, and a cinema where\nthe horror classic \u2018Eyes Without a\nFace\u2019 plays silently, while the other\nhalf of the building is the studio itself;\na world of seedy dressing rooms and\nresentful production artists.\nhroughbriefsnatchesofinteraction\nbetween the cast members, the\naudience begins to pick up the plot; a\nmodern adaptation of Woyzeck, Georg\nBuchner\u2019s classic tale of jealousy,\npower, and murder, he Drowned\nMan tells two parallel stories: outside\nthe studio gates William watches as\nhis wife Mary is seduced by Dwayne\n- after catching them in the act,\nWilliam kills Mary in the wilderness.\nMeanwhile, inside the studio, Wendy\nis shooting a \ufb01lm and su\ufb00ering from\nviolent hallucinations, and when her\nhusband Marshall falls in love with\nthe studio\u2019s queen bee Dolores Grey,\nWendy murders him. hese two tales\nintertwine, and loop back around\neach other, with parts being repeated\nthroughout the evening, conjuring\nup an unnerving atmosphere of fear,\nparanoia, and confusion.\nHowever, while the atmosphere\nmay be intuitive to those attending,\nthe plot proved di\ufb03cult to penetrate.\nPunchdrunk doesn\u2019t make things easy\nfor the viewers, forcing them on a\nwild goose chase around the studios\nin order to track down the fragments\nof the story, meaning that most people\nwill not see all parts of the production.\nCombine this with minimal dialogue\nand a large dose of interpretive dance\nchoreographed by Maxine Doyle, and\nyou have a pretty impenetrable story.\nI must admit that the plot didn\u2019t\nmake much sense to me until I read\nthe programme in retrospect. Whilst\nin a traditional theatre performance\nsuch a confusing plot would go down\nlike a lead balloon, in Punchdrunk\u2019s\nworld it is the experience that matters,\nand what an experience this is.\nhe set design team, led by Felix\nBarrett, form the cornerstone of\nPunchdrunk\u2019s spectacle; quite literally\nthousands of props have been brought\nin to transform the abandoned\nbuilding into the desolate studio.\nhe themes of decayed Americana,\ncombined with the masks, give the\nwhole thing a Lynchian air, and the\nattention to detail makes me feel like\nI\u2019ve stepped into an actual \ufb01lm. From\nvast forest wilderness to love letters\nhidden in drawers, it feels like nothing\nhas been overlooked, giving every\nobject a sense of importance. his is\nspectacular, but slightly overwhelming\n- you could easily spend a whole day\njust looking through the rooms, never\nmind following the story.\nBeing a relative late-comer to the\nPunchdrunk party, I don\u2019t know how\ntheir previous productions have\ndi\ufb00ered to he Drowned Man, but I\ndo get the sense that the shows have\nlost some of their surprise element.\nIt is clear that a large proportion of\nthe people at the show have been to\na Punchdrunk experience before -determined not to miss anything,\nthey chase the actors around in packs,\nmaking some scenes impossible to see.\n\u201ccombine minimal\ndialogue and a large\ndose of interpretive\ndance and you have\na pretty impenetrable\nstory\u201d\nPerhaps the company are over\ufb01lling the space - and who can blame\nthem when the \ufb01nancial status of\nBritish theatre is considered - or the\nanonymity provided by the masks\nallow members of the audience to\nlive out their anti-social, voyeuristic\nfantasies, but the behaviour of those\nwatching ruins some of the magic.\nSome of the best experiences I had in\nthe show were the ones where there\nwere very few people, and the most\nmemorable part for me was watching\na shrouded \ufb01gure perform a strange\nritual in a tiny chapel. When you\nwatch a scene like that, it feels like\nyou have stumbled across something\nhidden, that many other people will\nmiss, and these experiences are few\nand far between.\nWhile previous Punchdrunk shows\nhave met with near-universal acclaim,\nthis show has left the critics and\naudiences more divided, and it is not\nhard to see why. A dazzling level of\ndetailinthesetisbelittledbythelackof\nattention to the audience experience - I\nget the feeling that this is the company\nat their most introspective, and it\ncould be argued that this is theatre\nat its purest, where the participants\nplay their parts irrespective of the\naudience. It should also be noted\nthat, while any review of a piece of\ntheatre relies upon a single person\u2019s\nexperience, with this show that is\nintensi\ufb01ed; it is entirely likely that I\nhad an experience not only slightly\ndissimilar, but probably completely\ndi\ufb00erent to some other viewers - such\nis the nature of Punchdrunk. But at the\nheart of this production, underneath\nthe stunningly sumptuous production\ndesign, lies an incomprehensible plot\nand a rather uncomfortable viewing\nexperience. I would recommend\ngoing simply for the experience - I\nleave the building feeling bewildered,\nastonished, and ever so slightly\nPunchdrunk.\n\n"

Initially touted as\na benchmark setting nich\u00e9 series of\ndevices, the Nexus series has spawned\no\ufb00 its own fanbase for users who are\ninterested in always having the latest\nversion of Android free from any\ncustom manufacturer\u2019s skins. he\noriginal Nexus 7 released in 2012 was\nlauded as one of the best tablets upon\nits release. However, one year on,\nthe Tegra 3 System-On-Chip (SOC)\nin it has shown its limitation with\nsub-par performance and battery\nlife. Combined with the cheap \ufb02ash\nmemory used in its manufacture,\nthe original Nexus 7 now feels like a\nsluggish monster to use. Google has\nseeked to rectify this with the new\nNexus 7 model. Starting at \u00a3199 for a\n16 GB model, the Nexus 7 is one of the\nmost a\ufb00ordable 7-inch tablets in the\nmarket, if you discount the recently\nreleased budget \u00a3119 tablet called\n\u201cHudl\u201d by Tesco (which apparently\ndoes not suck at all!). he Nexus 7\ntouts an impressive screen resolution\nof 1920 x 1200 pixels at 323 pixels\nper inch (ppi). And thankfully, it has\nditched the Tegra series of SOC for\nthe Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro,\nand comes with a hefty 2 GB of RAM.\nhe display is an absolute treat. With\nsuch an impressive ppi, I can hardly\ntell the pixels apart from each other.\nText looks absolutely crisp and a joy\nto read. With a PDF of my report\nzoomed out to display an entire page\non screen, I could read the text on it\nwithout needing to strain my eyes.\nhe colours do seem a bit yellowish,\nbut that could be due to the poor\ncolour calibration on Google\u2019s part,\nsomething which could be \ufb01xed\nwith some manual user calibration\nif they root the device, (then again,\nthis is highly subjective.) he high\nresolution seems to also have taken\nits toll on the animations of some\nunoptimised applications. Scrolling\nthrough an article on the Guardian\napplication is janky, and the page \ufb02ip\nanimation of my PDF application is\nsimply unusable. Although the battery\nis smaller in size than the original\nNexus 7, the battery life is much better\non this new model. Turning on the\nscreen for prolonged usage, however,\nstill destroys the battery life, although\nat a slower rate. he tablet boosts an\namazing standby power consumption.\nI left the tablet overnight with WiFi\nThe Torrid State of the Onion\nApparently, the best 7-inch tablet you can get\nIt was something like a 90s\ncyberpunk\u2019s dream: an anonymous,\nhidden marketplace on the \u201cdeep\nweb\u201d where everything from research\npsychedelics to stolen credit card\ndetails could be bought. he Silk\nRoad, considered by some a bold\nexperiment in libertarianism, by\nothers the biggest online hotbed of\nillegal trade, was \ufb01nally shut down\nby the FBI last week after over\ntwo years of successful operation.\nTor, he Onion Router, sends\nconnections through several relays\naround the world, hiding users\u2019 ip\naddresses from websites they visit. It\nalso allows websites like he Silk Road,\nknown as hidden services, which are\nonly accessible via Tor and have a\n.onion domain name. Tor is widely\nused by journalists and activists to\nhide their identities and circumvent\ncensorship in oppressive countries,\nbut its hidden services are infamous\nfor piracy and criminal activity.\nhe Silk Road takedown is the latest\nin a recent spate of developments on\nthe Tor network: two weeks earlier,\nanother marketplace called Atlantis\nshut down, seemingly voluntarily. In\nAugust, the hidden webhost service\nFreedom Hosting, which served\nchild pornography, was seized by\nthe FBI. Later that month, millions\nof new clients connected to the\nTor network, far more than natural\ngrowth in the service\u2019s popularity can\naccount for, most likely a criminal\nbotnet. hese events have raised\nconcerns for Tor\u2019s users, especially\nin light of the recent NSA leaks:\nis the network as anonymous as it\nclaims, or has it been compromised\nby law enforcement agencies?\nhe Silk Road\u2019s operator is known\nto its users as Dread Pirate Roberts.\nIn real life, he is 29 year old physicist\nRoss Ulbricht, who lives in San\nFrancisco, and who had earned around\n$80 million from the site. He was\narrested last hursday and charged\nwith narcotics trafficking, computer\nhacking and money laundering, but\nit was human error, rather than any\n\ufb02aw in Tor\u2019s anonymity, which led to\nhis arrest: at the time of Silk Road\u2019s\nlaunch in January 2011, a user called\nAltoid appeared on several forums\nadvertisingthesite.Onepostcontained\nUlbricht\u2019s personal email address,\nwhich led to his being investigated.\nIn the Freedom Hosting case,\nthe owner attempted to set up a\nbitcoin-dealing company using his\nreal identity, which the FBI linked\nto the hidden services. he FBI took\ncontrol of the servers after his arrest.\nBoth of these show that Tor hasn\u2019t\nbeen compromised; however, Tor\ndoesn\u2019t protect from old fashioned\ncracking, an unsecured hidden\nservice, while anonymous, is just as\nsusceptible to attack as something\naccessible from the internet.\nTor\u2019s software is open source and\nextensively vetted, and the Tor Project\nsay, \u201cnothing about this case makes\nus think that there are new ways\nto compromise Tor (the software\nor the network)\u201d. A recent leaked\npresentation from the NSA claims\nthat, \u201cwe will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time\u201d,\nturned on and woke up to \ufb01nd that\nit has drained less than 5% of the\nbattery life. Pretty impressive! On the\nnumber side of things, I can only say\nunscienti\ufb01cally that the device feels\nfast. It is a joy to use. If you are looking\nfor the numbers on the device, I would\npoint you to the excellent review that\nAnandTech (http://www.anandtech.\ncom/show/7231/the-nexus-7-2013-review) has done. My only concern\nwith the device is how it does not try\nto exceed the current hardware norm,\nand break the mold. While the price\nis really great for its hardware, the\nhardware is simply what is current at\nthe time of its release. his means that\nthe hardware will become outdated\nrather quickly. While it is inevitable\nfor devices released today to become\noutdated tomorrow, I was hoping\nthat Google would try and set a\nhigher standard with its current line\nof Nexus devices, much like how the\noriginal Nexus One did. he Nexus\n7 is an excellent device. If you are in\nthe market for a 7-inch device, and are\nunwilling to pay the price that Apple\nhas asked for its iPad Mini, the Nexus\n7 should be at the top of your list. It has\na good price, with excellent hardware.\nhe device is also guaranteed to always\nrun the latest version of Android,\nunencumbered by the lengthy\ndelays that Android devices are\ninfamous for their software updates.\ngoing on to say that with manual\nanalysis they can reveal a very small\nfraction of users, but not on demand.\nStill, the con\ufb01dence of Tor\u2019s users,\nmany of whom are attempting to\nevade snooping by the NSA, has been\nshaken. When the FBI seized Freedom\nHosting, they installed javascript\ncode exploiting older versions of\nthe Tor Browser Bundle which\nrevealed many users\u2019 IP addresses\n,not so much a chip in Tor\u2019s armour,\nbut a complete sidestep around it.\nhe exploit was quickly \ufb01xed, but\nraises deep concerns that similar\nvulnerabilitiescouldariseinthefuture.\nWhile Tor is certainly still safe\nfor its intended purpose, hiding\nyour ip from websites, these recent\nevents show that Tor alone isn\u2019t\nenough to protect you when hosting\ncriminal activity. Paranoid users are\nlooking towards alternatives such\nas i2p and Project Meshnet, but for\nmost, the onion router\u2019s anonymity\nhasn\u2019t yet been peeled away.\nKier Little on the shutdown of the web\u02bcs biggest drug dealership\n\n"

Some of them are studying,\nbut others are doing something\neven better! hey\u2019ve just decided\nto create a new society at Imperial!\nDuring the Summer Term of 2012,\nseveral Mechanical Engineering\nstudents decided to start the Imperial\nCollege Design Collective. Design was\nsomething that was touched upon in\nsome of their classes, and actually in\nmost engineering degrees. However,\nstudents often have to give it a second\npriority compared to the wave of\nworkload of Mathematics, Mechanics,\nDynamics\u2026 well a lot of \u2018ics\u2019\nessentially. hey saw beyond this wave\nand realised that their engineering\nskills were valued in the design world.\nProduct design needs people with\nhard knowledge to manufacture and\nprototype the idea. And in the wide\nrange of design, there is always a place\nfortheideasofpragmaticandeducated\nscientists, medics, and engineers.\nYou\u2019ll ask me: \u201cWhy did they call it\nthe Design Collective?\u201d hat\u2019s quite\nsimple actually. hese entrepreneurial\nstudents decided that although this\ndesign society was born out of the\nMechanicalEngineeringbuilding,they\nknew they wanted to involve as many\nstudents as possible from all possible\ndegrees and backgrounds. hey\nwanted a collective of students that\ncould bring a variety of background\nknowledgeandskillsinordertoinspire\neach other in the design process!\nhe Imperial College Design\nCollective (ICDC) had an amazing\n\ufb01rst year following its genesis. Coming\nfrom all over Imperial College of\nScience, Medicine and Technology,\nand even the Imperial Business\nSchool, 56 members were inspired\nby the themes of Enhancing Cycling\nin London, Sustainability, Toys, and\nInteractive City. Even more attended\nthe talks by architect Andrew Waugh,\nbrand designer Simon Manchipp,\nengineering designer Peter Childs,\nand urban designer Kathryn Firth.\nWith two o\ufb03ce visits to IDEO in\nClerkenwell and Pentagram in Notting\nHill, members were immersed into\na universe of brilliance in creating\nprocesses, objects, projects that\nenhance the human experience.\nhis year, the committee has\nprepared new themes for the\ncollective to build upon. Some\nmembers may come to an interesting\ntalk by a guest, others will favour the\nWednesday afternoon workshops,\nand some will be privileged with\na visit to a London design o\ufb03ce.\nI \ufb01rst came to Andrew Waugh\u2019s\npresentation of his battle to build the\n\ufb01rst multi-storey residential timber\nbuilding in London, and I recognized\nmy need for alternate activities to my\ndegree and sports. I loved attending\nthe evening talks and being inspired by\nthe passion of entrepreneurs who used\ntheir educational and professional\nbackground to create something that\nthey thought could bene\ufb01t society.\nAnd that\u2019s really why I encourage\neveryone to join this energy-fuelled\nsocietythatwilladdaspiceofcreativity\nand a dash of entrepreneurship\nto your Imperial experience.\nJoin the mailing list or email\nicdcollective@imperial.ac.uk\nfor more information.\nJonathan Pratt\nStation Manager\nImperial College Design Collective\nGuillaume Valla on IC\u02bcs hidden group of designers\nSTOIC: Imperial\u2019s student run tv station\n\u201cS\nTOIC, you\u2019re\nthe philosophy\nsociety right?\u201d\nIs a question I\nreceive many\ntimes throughout the course of the\nyear. he latest being at Freshers\u2019\nFair while standing in front of a\nlarge AutoCue, professional video\ncamera and a TV playing a showreel\nof our best bits. While I do have a\nparticular love of 3rd century BCE\nphilosophy that isn\u2019t what the club is\nabout. STOIC in fact is an acronym of\nStudentTelevisionofImperialCollege,\nand that\u2019s exactly who we are. From\nour studios in the West Basement of\nBeit Quad we write, \ufb01lm, present and\nproduce a wide variety of television\nshows that get broadcast online.\nOur longest running show is IC\nNews, which has existed in various\nforms for as long as the society has,\nbut that\u2019s far from all we produce.\nLast year alone we had interviews,\nSTOIC\ndocumentaries, short \ufb01lms and even\nsome Eastern European political\nsatire. his year is looking even more\nexciting than the last, with a few\nexciting press opportunities coming\nup this term alone. he most popular\nshow we currently produce is the\ninfamous Metric Moments videos,\nwhich I\u2019m sure many of you have seen\norevenstarredin.Ifnotthenheadover\nto our YouTube to \ufb01nd out what some\nof the brightest minds in the country\nthink of the important issues in the\nworld, ranging from Barack Obama\u2019s\nre-election to \u201cbrown nipples\u201d,\n\u201ccross-fucking\u201d, and \u201cAmerican \u2018gine\u201d.\nIn the Spring term large amounts of\nour time is devoted to our two biggest\nevents of the year; he Big Elections\nand the JPR Williams Cup match\nat Varsity. For he Big Elections we\nproduce a live hustings show, where\nall the candidates for the sabbatical\npositions get a chance to convince\nyou why to vote for them. Hearing\n20 people talk about \u201ctransparency\u201d,\n\u201caccessibility\u201d and \u201ccontactless\npayment\u201d never gets old. he JPR\nWilliams Cup is contested with a\nrugby match between Imperial and\nImperial Medicals, and last year we\n\ufb01lmed this with a large scale 4 camera\nshoot for the \ufb01rst time. his then got\nreleased as both a highlights package\nand a full match reel complete with\nexcellent commentary from IC Radio.\nGetting involved with STOIC is\nreally easy; absolutely no experience\nis required to jump right in.\nWhether you\u2019re interested in \ufb01lming,\nST IC\npresenting, acting, editing, writing\nor just want to see what goes in in a\nstudent TV station you\u2019re more than\nwelcome to join.

    "content": "29\nFRIDAY 11 OCT\nTECHNOLOGY\n@felixtechnology\nFelixImperial\nOsama Awara, new tech editor, informs you about 3D space printing!\nLaunching a rocket into space is in\nitself a tricky business; well after all it\nis rocket science!\nBeing able to repair one or a space\nstation for that matter is a di\ufb00erent\nball game altogether. NASA has plans\nto launch their very own 3-D printer\nby next year, and for those of you\nwho aren\u2019t familiar with this novel\nway of printing, it basically involves\nmaking a 3-D object of your choice\nand having a machine spew it out for\nyou by simply adding layers of material\ntogether. NASA has been looking at\nways for many years to make the lives\nof astronauts easier, as if having to\nchase their food around isn\u2019t trouble\nenough, astronauts have to worry\nabout repairing faulty components in\nand around space craft/stations which\ncan potentially be life threatening if\nnot attended to. A perfect example\nof this was in 1970 when astronauts\nabroad the fatally struck Apollo 13\nwere forced to jerry rig a carbon-dioxide \ufb01lter using scrap materials\nsuch as a plastic bag and book cover\nand the old classic of DIY: duct tape.\nIf it were not for the ingenuity of crew\nmembers and engineers on ground\ncontrol, this could\u2019ve potentially been\na disastrous return mission. What\nNASA aims to do with 3-D printing\nis allow astronauts to build their own\nrepair tools and replacement parts so\nincidents that happened back in the\nold \u201970s NASA era aren\u2019t repeated.\n\u201cImagine an astronaut needing to make\na life-or-death repair\u2026 Rather than\nhoping that the necessary parts and\ntools are on the station already, what\nif the parts could be 3-D printed when\nthey needed them?\u201d Aaron Kemmer,\nCEO of Made in Space, a company\nwhich is one of Silicon Valley\u2019s new\nmembers and are contracted to\noversee NASA\u2019s 3-D printing space\nprogramme (pretty impressive for a\nstart-up to say the least).\nNow of course it\u2019s not just space\nsafety that 3-D printers will improve\nbut also making the availability of\nspace (if you\u2019d pardon the pun) a hell of\na lot better. Imagine eventually being\nable to launch a printer into space that\nallows you to make virtually anything,\nall you\u2019d need to take up with you\nis just the printer and some plastic,\nobviously I\u2019m exaggerating a wee bit\nbut you get my point, 3-D printers will\nmake sending a rocket into space a lot\nless heavier which for NASA is a big\nbonus because fuel prices just aren\u2019t\nin the favour of anyone these days,\napart from them Saudi oil lords. Scott\nCrump, one of the \ufb01rst developers of\n3-D printing said, \u2018he good news is\nthat you don\u2019t have to have this huge\namount of inventory in space, but the\nbad news is now you need materials,\u2019\nand I get his point: you\u2019 will need to\nbe able to store large quantities of\ndi\ufb00erent types of material (namely\nplastic and metal) but at the end of\nthe day storing them is a lot easier and\nconvenient then storing already built\nand functioning equipment. What\nis more amazing than printing tools\nand parts, is miniature 3-D satellites,\n\u2018what!?\u2019 I hear you shout, yes, NASA\nengineers are also trying their hands\nat 3-D printing these little bad-boys\nthat could shoot out of the space\nstation and transmit signals to earth.\nOf course space printers are going to\nhave to be made slightly di\ufb00erent from\ntheir earthly counterparts as they\u2019d\nhave to operate under zero gravity\nand survive the ridiculous amount of\nvibrations during take-o\ufb00 in order to\nland in one piece, so in terms of cost\nit\u2019d be more than your average $2000\n3-D printer but knowing NASA\u2019s\noutrageous budgets investing in one\nof these would be like us going into\na supermarket and buying a kilo of\ntomatoes. All in all for any remaining\nsceptics out there, 3-D printing is a\nsustainable method for bringing with\nyou what you need when you need it.\n3-D Printers take off!\nBBC iPlayer 30 days!\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nOsama Awara\nTechnology Editors\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to\ndatewith thenewest,wierdestandmostfuturisticthingsaround\n1 millionth Rasperry Pi\nSamsung curved screen\nhe \ufb01rst ever curved smartphone has been launched.

When the show de-buted, Emily\u2019s goal was to take down\nanyone and everyone who played a\npart in her innocent father\u2019s (James\nTupper) unfair downfall and his\neventual death - and at the heart of\nthis conspiracy was the Graysons,\na wealthy Hamptonite family who\nwould lie, cheat, manipulate and\nkill anyone to score an extra buck\nor two. There were mindgames between Emily and the Grayson matriarch Victoria (Madeleine Stowe) as\nEmily worked her magic wrapping\nDaniel Grayson (Joshua Bowman),\nthe Grayson son, around her fingers.\nWithanexplosiveseason1finale,Revenge was supposed to have an even\nbetter follow-up season.\nSo where did it all go wrong? Season2hasended,andthethirdseason\nis well under way, but unless there\nis a serious creative reboot, Revenge\nmay as well call it quits, as the sliding\nratings show the audience wasn\u2019t a\nhuge fan of the second series.\nThe problems started when characters with potential were written off\nwith barely a chance to speak. Most\nnotable was Jennifer Jason Leigh\u2019s\nembarrassingly brief stint on the\nshow as Emily\u2019s biological mother.\nAs a mentally unstable character,\nthere could have been more drama\nto play around with, but sadly after\none brief hostage situation she went\naway for good. Much anticipation\nand hype surrounded what Emily\u2019s\nmother would bring to the overall\nnarrative and what chemistry she\nwould share with the cast but alas,\nthis was not meant to be, and an actress of Jason Leigh\u2019s calibre should\nhave gotten more.\nExhibit B of more useless charac-ters: the men. That is, of course, with\nthe exception of Conrad Grayson\n(Henry Czerny) whose pure evil nature makes him awesome as he gets\nmore deserved screen time. Nolan\n(Gabriel Mann) is also invaluable to\nEmily\u2019s quest, and is excluded from\nthis category. Plus, he\u2019s loaded and\nis a genius. Who can hate a man\nlike that? So \u201cthe men\u201d include Jack\nPorter (Nick Wechsler), his often-invisible younger brother Declan\n(ConnorPaolo),DanielGrayson,and\nanewentrytothecast,AidanMathis\n(Barry Sloane). Jack the lost puppy in\nsearch of a connection only delays\nand derails Emily\u2019s agenda, which\nmakes for more sappy minutes, Declan goes to a fancy posh school and\nfinds that he\u2019s not fitting in so well\n(oh god), and Daniel is stepping up\nto the challenge of becoming a bona\nfide Grayson, plotting and scheming\nalthough still looking like an over-sizedimmature14-year-oldwayover\nhis head. The worst offender of all\nhowever is Aidan - an old classmate\nof Emily. The two of them met whilst\nthey were both in the Japanese Revengey Academy (not a real place).\nTheir sensei saw romance developing between the two, and decided\nto tear them apart. It\u2019s been years,\nthey reconnect, and he wants to help\nEmily. Help her how exactly...? All\nAidan does is create another side of\na love-shape Emily\u2019s rapidly building up for herself, and with another\neligible bachelor comes at least a few\nepisodes of mopey sulking, when\npeople should really be getting their\nact together and launching an attack\non the smug Graysons.\nWant more needless characters?\nCharlotte Grayson (Christa B. Allen) should have stayed dead with\ntheoverdosefromtheseason1finale\nand Amanda Clarke (Margarita Levieva), Emily\u2019s \u201cbest friend aka the\ngirl Emily swapped identities with\u201d\nwants the audience\u2019s sympathy when\nit comes to the mid-season climax,\nand to that I say too little too late.\nOnly Ashley Davenport (Ashley\nMadekwe), the Graysons\u2019 live-in\nslave (not being racist here, she really\nIS a slave), shows potential with her\nduplicitous, selfish side emerging,\nonly for that to go nowhere too (she\u2019s\nalso being written out for season 3 -bye bye Ashley, be a dear and poison\nCharlotte on your way out will you?).\nThings take an even more drastic\nturn for the worse with the introduction of The Initiative, a collection of\nbad guys ultimately responsible for\neverything bad that\u2019s happened in\nEmily\u2019s life. The name is ridiculous in\nitself, and when we get a glimpse into\ntheir offices, oh what a treat we\u2019re in\nfor. They sit in their sci-fi futuristic\nset, one that would most likely find\nits place on the Starship Enterprise,\nthey stare at screens and make decisions to kill people. Yes there may be\npeople in the world who do this kind\nof thing for a living, but given how\nRevenge started, this marked a serious step down for the show.\nPutting a face on The Initiative are\nHelen Crowley (Wendy Crewson)\nand Mr Trask (Burn Gorman), two\nvillains so over the top they make\nDisney baddies look like a real-world\npossibility. Helen eventually clashes\nwith Victoria, the protective mother,\nwho has one highlight episode of actually doing something memorable.\nThat\u2019s right...ONE...out of 22.\nVictoria, as always, is craftier with\nher verbal threats than she is when\nit comes to actually getting things\ndone. She fancies herself as quite the\nschemer and backstabber, but she always finds herself on the losing end.\nBut on the plus side, she always looks\nso damn flawless and outshines her\nyounger co-stars which is a real visual treat.\nComing back to the character who\nstartedallthisinthefirstplace,Emily\nlooks as lost as the writers. She dilly\ndallys with her revenge idea, a huge\nlet-down for everyone who\u2019s been\nrooting for her since day one (i.e.\nme), and with a drewwwwary pace\nthat is more interested in her love\nstories, Emily has very little time to\nflex her action muscles and put her\ntacky martial arts moves to good use\nin dodgy choreography.\nAre things looking better for the\nthird season? Well...to start with,\ntwo of the aforementioned good-for-nothing roles were given the brutal\naxe (not literally - although this is\nan absolutely just cause for celebra-tion: hurrah), but to put a damper of\nthings is the announcement that two\nnew actors have signed on for recurring roles. One, a character close to\nVictoria and another who may or\nmay not have something going on\nwith Daniel. Only time will tell on\nwhetherthereareenoughpeoplestill\ninvested in the show to keep those\nall important 18-49-year-olds\u2019 rat-ings/share, but to not haemorrhage\nviewers, the show needs to go back\nto where everything kicked off so\nwell, and lose all the fancy wannabe\nplot lines to keep everything taut and\nfocused.\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nEditor: Maciej\nMatuszewski, Eva\nRosenthal\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14 FRIDAY 11 OCT\nScalzi\u2019s Old Man\u2019s War\nJohn Scalzi is one of the highest pro\ufb01le\nscience \ufb01ction authors alive. A proli\ufb01c\nwriter, he was also President of the Science\nFiction and Fantasy Writers of America,\nconsulted on the hit TV show Stargate\nUniverse, maintains a hugely popular blog\nand is an outspoken activist for many good\ncauses. It was therefore with high hopes\nthat last year I picked up Redshirts \u2013 one\nof his latest novels, which recently won the\nHugo award. Unfortunately the reality did\nnot live up to the hype \u2013 it was, e\ufb00ectively,\na single Star Trek joke stretched out to \ufb01ll\n300 pages, with uninspired characterisation\nand insipid prose. Over time, however, I\nbegan to suspect that I might have judged\nScalzi too harshly and that it might be\nworth giving a writer of his reputation\nanother chance. herefore, I recently\nread Old Man\u2019s War \u2013 his \ufb01rst ever novel.\nhe book is set in the distant future \u2013\nwith humanity having \ufb01nally reached the\nstars and found out that we are not alone.\nhe various species of the galaxy are caught\nup in a near constant state of con\ufb02ict \u2013\nin many ways the reminiscent of 19th\ncentury colonial wars. While Earth itself\nis isolated from the \ufb01ghting, as well as the\ngreater galactic community in general, by\nits colonies the planet\u2019s citizens when they\nturn 75 may join the Colonial Defence Force\nand receive a rejuvenation treatment before\nStudent picks\ngetting the chance to see the universe. he\nnovel follows John Perry, who makes this\nvery choice, and his fellow new recruits as\nthey go through basic training, have their\n\ufb01rst taste of combat and learn how, in the\ncurrent con\ufb02ict, there are no real \u2018good guys\u2019\n.\nIn many ways this book has many problems\nsimilar to those in Redshirts. he main issue I\nhave with Scalzi\u2019s characters in both books is\nthat they are all essentially the same person.\nhe protagonists may be di\ufb00erentiated\nby gender or ethnicity but they all have\nthe same personality \u2013 smart, outspoken,\ngenerally nice but often sarcastic \u2013 in short,\npeople very similar to Scalzi himself. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong \u2013 Scalzi knows how to write\nthis character type very well but seeing it half\na dozen times in the same novel gets really\ntiring, really fast. Scalzi\u2019s prose is, to put it\nnicely, very utilitarian. It is clear and readable\nbut nothing more. here is no beauty in it \u2013 it\nis used merely as a tool to get the story across.\nAll this leaves are the plot and themes\n\u2013 and here is where my opinion of the two\nnovel diverges. While Redshirts was just, in\ne\ufb00ect, an extended parody, Old Man\u2019s War\nis something more. While focusing mainly\non the personal experiences of John Perry\nit also subtly conveys the far larger and\ndeeper story of galactic con\ufb02ict and, by the\nend, it manages to ask serious questions\nabout the nature of war and colonisation.\nAll the while it remains very exciting \u2013\nboth in the fast paced combat scenes and\nin the tense moments in between them.\nhese positives don\u2019t cancel out the\nnegatives, but they do help me forget them\nand make the book a very enjoyable read.\nhere are novels which explore similar\nthemes in more depth and with greater skill\nbut few which do it in such an engaging\nmanner. I do believe that Scalzi\u2019s popularity\nas a person has arti\ufb01cially in\ufb02ated the\npopularity of his books and Old Man\u2019s\nWar is certainly not a masterpiece but\nthe fact is that I read it in a single day and\nits sequels are already on my reading list.\nIn Henry James\u2019 The Figure in the Carpet, several unlucky people become obsessed with painstakingly unearthing the\nmeaning concealed \u2013 literally \u2013 in the\nworks of a brilliant novelist. The story\nplays easily with the reader; it dangles a\nsomething sweet \u2013 the promise of ultimate knowledge \u2013 in front of us and ultimately disappoints. The after effect is\nwittily insidious: one may start to think\nthat there could be, that there definitely\nis, a golden key, to decoding James\u2019 entire\nbody of work. If one were to look carefully enough, obsessively enough, perhaps it could be found\u2026 James cautions\nus throughout with his sad and unhappy\ncharacters but it is hard to resist his rid-dle.\nThis dilemma, to me, exemplifies the\npower of James\u2019 short stories. More than\njust a writer of impossible syntax, James\nwill drag the reader along with subtlety\nand stealth until they emerge, albeit fully\nsubmerged in the Jamesian world.\nWithin 50 pages \u2013 and sometimes far\nless \u2013 humans are exquisitely drawn up.\nThe characters feel heavy and tangible\nfrom the moment they appear; their ac-tions, however strange, are precisely\nwhat they should be. As can be seen from\nthe few examples below, James\u2019 stories\ncover a wide range of subjects, which he\ntreats with equal care and brilliance.\nDaisy Miller tells of the problems that\na young American girl faces when travelling through Europe. Her personality is\nlost on the Europeans, whom she sometimes understands but who rarely understand her. Her desire for freedom and, in\nmany ways, for simply flitting through\nlife, are misunderstood by even her closest friends, who carelessly and cruelly\ncriticise and abandon her.\nIn La Pension Beaurepas, caricatures of\nrather empty ladies-who-shop, bankrupting their hardworking caretaker in the\nprocess, are juxtaposed with everything\nbeautiful and delicate about desire.\nJames\u2019 In the Cage has the feel of a detective story; here the voyeuristic tendencies and the imagination of a young, unnamed telegraphist, stuck in both a literal\nand a metaphoric cage, combine to conjure up an unexpected adventure. From\nher position as a \u2018nothing\u2019, she achieves a\nremarkable level of knowledge \u2013 perhaps\nreal, perhaps fanciful \u2013 about the extravagantly rich people she comes into contact with. This is a tale which, ultimately\ndisheartening in its outlook, nevertheless\nencourages extravagant daydreaming to\ndeal with the greyer hours.\nShort stories are perfect if you don\u2019t\nhave the time or energy to concentrate on\na longer novel. You can pick the book up\nwhenever you want, sure in the knowledge that you won\u2019t have to leave something unfinished for weeks while you\nwork towards your next deadline. James\u2019\ntales are also something of a \u2018language\nworkout\u2019; they require a little effort but\nthe rewards are copious and the reader\u2019s\nEnglish may become much improved.\nSelected Tales by Henry James; published by Penguin Classics ed. 2001.\nBest of Henry James\nMaciej Matuszewski\nBooks Editor\nEva Rosenthal\nBooks Editor\nHave you ever wondered where your most mundane\nthoughts come from?

Lying on the Hangzhou Bay,\njust southwest of Shanghai, Hangzhou\nhas great economic power. It has\nbeen one of the most renowned and\nprosperous cities of China since Qin\nDynasty, due in part to its beautiful\nnatural scenery. Hangzhou is at\nthe southern end of China\u2019s Grand\nCanal which extends to Beijing.\nhe city \ufb01rst appeared in written\nrecords as Yuhang, meaning \u2018Yu\u2019s\nFerry\u2019, and was incorporated into\nthe Chinese empire as a part of the\nKuaiji Commandery during the\nQin Dynasty. In 589 CE the city\nwas renamed Hangzhou, and a city\nwall was constructed two years\nlater. In 923 CE Wuyue Kingdom\nwas founded, and for the \ufb01rst time\nHangzhou had become a capital of a\nregime. Hangzhou was also the centre\nof politics, the economy and culture in\nSouthern Song. It also gives Hangzhou\nthe prestigious status of being one of\nthe Seven Ancient Capitals of China.\nWe cannot talk about Hangzhou\nwithout mentioning West Lake,\na freshwater lake located in the\nhistoric area of Hangzhou. he lake\nis divided by the Bai Causeway, Su\nCauseway and Yang Gong Causeway,\nwhich made signi\ufb01cant contributions\nto Hangzhou\u2019s prosperity. Marco\nPolo once came to Hangzhou and\nfamously praised it as city of heaven.\nhere are numerous temples,\npagodas, gardens, and arti\ufb01cial\nislands within the lake. It was made\na UNESCO World Heritage Site\nin 2011, and was described as \u201can\nidealized fusion between humans\nand nature.\u201d Almost all of the natural\nparks and museums are free to\nvisitors from all over the world.\nThe West Lake\nIt was a lazy, breezy autumn afternoon.\nhe blue \ufb02agstones were still a little wet\nafter the light rain at noon. he smell of\nperfumehungintheair:osmanthuswas\nblossoming. Hangzhou, the great city,\nwas like a young graceful lady. A thin\nlayer of fog penetrated above the West\nLake, as if the elegant lady was wearing\na veil. Small boats scattered on the lake\nand dangled gleamingly in the fog.\nSometimes, big dragon barges passed\nby before disappearing back into the\nmist again. On the horizon, continuous\nhills merged with the sky and the\nlake. Willows kissed the water. A few\ndilapidated lotuses were whispering\nabout how they had just culminated\nthe summer. Crewmen and teahouse\nclerks were calling for business.\nHot spring water ran into a glass. he\ngreen tea leaves opened their curled\nbodies, stood up and danced in the\nwater. Tiger-dug spring with Dragon\nWell tea: the most perfect match in\nChinese tea history. I held the glass and\ntasted a drop. A fresh smell tinged my\ntongue, and the hot steam blurred my\nglasses. I just closed my eyes, to feel the\nvitality and the spring locked within.\nPieces of sweet Osmanthus cakes,\nlost words, and fond memories were\nwith me throughout the afternoon.\nHangzhou is my beloved hometown.\nI sometimes think it is not blood in my\nvessels, but the water of the West Lake.\nI had been told countless fairy tales\nabout the West Lake since I was a little\ngirl. he most popular one was a love\nstory between a mercy snake banshee\nand a human. he broken bridge on\nthe West Lake was where they met,\nalthough it has not been broken down\nuntil now. I guess it is not the bridge,\nbut the heart that broke, as the snake\nwas not permitted to be with a real\nman. In the end she was locked under\na tower, the Leifeng Pagoda, and\nseparated from her husband forever.\nWhen I grew up, I had read many\npoems about Hangzhou and the West\nLake: great poets have not only given\nus beautiful poetry, but have kept\nthe West Lake a unique treasure that\nwill continue inspire for generations.\nNight began to fall. Small boats were\nback and streetlights were on. Bars,\ncafes, clubs and teahouses began to\nget busy. As I was cycling around the\nlake, a musical performance began:\nthe Impressive West Lake by Yimou\nZhang.

Every French tourist on\nthe tube makes me want to jump on a plane and\nevery mention of cheese, wine or garlic makes\nme more than acceptably emotional. he truth is\nI\u2019ve got Erasmus blues. I met some lovely people,\nsaw new places, lived in a foreign country, learnt\na di\ufb00erent language blah, blah, blah\u2026 Really\nI did all of the things it says on the brochure. I\nalso made friends with people with names like\nPierre-Etienne and Delphine, and spent and awful\nlot of time playing board games with the best\ngroup of French nerds ever. I made friends from\nall over the world and found couches for all my\nfuture interrailing plans across Europe. Even so,\nhappiness is a question of timing, and more than\nonce I have heard fellow students describing their\nErasmus experiences far less enthusiastically\nthan me. For an unlucky Erasmuser, the French\naren\u2019t sophisticated, they\u2019re stuck-up, the Spanish\naren\u2019t friendly they\u2019re loud, the English aren\u2019t\u2026\nwell I don\u2019t know what positive things they say\nabout us, but add your own disgusting food-bad\nhumour stereotype at this point. In order to avoid\nany disappointment, here is a list of some major\npointers to think about if you are considering\nwhether of not you could be an Erasmuser:\nDid you enjoy group holidays as a child?\nErasmus, especially in the \ufb01rst few weeks,\ninvolves a lot of mingling and travelling to places\nwith large groups of people. Usually your host\nuniversity will organize some form of meeting\nor, if the institution isn\u2019t very hands-on, you can\njoin your local Erasmus Facebook page. here\nis usually a lot of souvenir buying, queuing\ntogether for things like banks and phone shops\nand generally awkward interacting (if you are\nunlucky). If childhood experiences like scouting\nand school trips to the zoo didn\u2019t traumatize\nyou, it\u2019s more likely that you will enjoy visiting a\nchurch/random Roman theatre/weirdly shaped\ncave with total strangers. But be aware that this is\npart of the process.\nDo you have your mind set on what you\nwant to do after university?\nErasmus is an academic and professional\nexperience, but don\u2019t be fooled, it isn\u2019t a year in\nresearch or industry. You will grow on a personal\nlevel and you will learn things about yourself and\nwhat you want to do \u201cwhen you grow up\u201d. But if\nyou already know these things, why bother? For\nsome people Erasmus just isn\u2019t the right choice, if\nyou\u2019re eager to \ufb01nish your studies and are scared\nto lose your friends as they graduate and leave\nyou to reach all their goals of wealth and fame,\nyou don\u2019t have to do it. On the other hand, if you\nare so determined, a welcome break before you\nstart your lifetime of achievements could be a\ngood idea.\nDid you miss your parents so much when\nyou came to university that the P&G advert\nfor the Olympics made you cry?\nAgain, I am not saying that you shouldn\u2019t go\nabroad if leaving your parents the \ufb01rst time was a\nbit of a trauma. Some years will have passed when\nyou eventually leave, and you will be older and\nwiser. But if you enjoy the comfort of your home\nand the people you\u2019ve known all your life, there\nis no need to leave, you can make new friends\nanywhere, and new experiences are new and\nexciting no matter what country you\u2019re in. he\nsame thing goes for your boyfriend/girlfriend.\nMost students take a year in another university to\n\u201cget to know\u201d another culture\u2026 one member of\nthe opposite sex at a time. Possibilities are endless\nas well, because Erasmus students (and I am sorry\nto say this but English ones in particular) have a\nbit of a reputation. But if you have someone to\nsnuggle up to while watching TV, then well done!\nYou\u2019ve earned the chance spend as much time\nas possible with them! Go be a smug couple if\nyou are so inclined, because no one will be very\ntolerant of your endless pining for a far away\nloved one once you leave Britain.\nAre you comfortable drinking large\nquantities of local alcoholic beverages in\norder to improve your foreign language\nabilities?\nhis is probably the least worrying of the\nconsiderations: I left London a lightweight\ndrinker who couldn\u2019t have a pint of cider at the\nunion without stumbling home afterwards,\nand I return with the drinking stamina of a\nsmall Australian rugby team. However, feeling\nuncomfortable about the language is a hard part of\ngoing on an Erasmus. he truth is that one never\nreally feels like the same person when speaking\na foreign language: jokes seem lamer; feelings\nappear impossible to translate into phrases, and\noccasionally, or very often, people laugh at your\nmistakes. his is something to consider because,\nif you are a naturally shy person, it is unlikely that\nyou will discover your inner lion while talking\nGerman to a group of Bavarian footballers from\nthe local club. Even so, at the end of the time you\nspend abroad you will have achieved some goals\nfrom a linguistic point of view, and anyway, there\nare always other Erasmus students, and chances\nare that you might be able to sneak a few cheeky\nEnglish phrases here and there.\nHaving considered all these things, you should\nnow consider this: nobody is, ever, ever again\ngoing to sponsor you for meeting lovely people,\nseeing new places, living in a foreign country,\nlearning a di\ufb00erent language and, yeah, doing all\nthe things it says on the brochure. You might get\nthe occasional feeling, reminiscent about the time\nyou were picked last for the volley team in PE, but\nthose passed then, and now the odds are all in your\nfavour. You came to Imperial a scared fresher, and\nnow you\u2019re a cool, easygoing Imperialite and full\nof friends! It\u2019s time to do it again and become an\nErasmuser! If you\u2019re really lucky you might even\nmeet a group of lovely nerds and spend the best\nfew months of your life.\nDisclaimer: students are advised to check out\nthe situation in their own deptartment\nImperial\u2019s Erasmus Mobility\nEvery year Imperial sends students abroad to study with a\nlarge number being sent via the Erasmus scheme.\nFRANCE\nGERMANY\nITALY\nNETHERLANDS\nSPAIN\nSWEDEN\n34\n9\n0\n10\n4\n7\n1\n40\n29\n10\n18\n1\n21\n2\nSWITZERLAND\nFROM IMPERIAL TO IMPERIAL\nB_\u0003rhn\u0003mabgd\u0003maZm\u0003rhn\b]\u0003ebd^\u0003mh\u0003`^m\u0003bgoheo^]\u0003pbma\u0003ma^\u0003>kZlfnl\u0003\nscheme or even meet some Erasmus students, why not\ncontact the Erasmus club?\nOtherwise if you think you could have made a better\ninfographic, contact felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSOURCE: IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON\nGiulia Gabrielli on the Erasmus experience\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCS\n34 FRIDAY 11 OCT\nWhy Volunteer?\nBen Fernando\nCharity Editor\nS\nome people think that charity should\nbe done as a completely sel\ufb02ess pursuit.\nPerhaps it should be! But the reality is\nthat we\u2019re all busy and want to enjoy\nour free time at Imperial, so why\nbother to do not-for-pro\ufb01t work? Here are a few\nreasons. Some of them are obvious, some are not\u2026\n1) You can make a contribution to people\nwho need our help \u2013whether it\u2019s refugees or drug\naddicts or people in extreme poverty; the charitable\ngroups at Imperial o\ufb00er you an opportunity to\nmake a di\ufb00erence. And what\u2019s more, you\u2019ll always be\ngiven the opportunity to see what the di\ufb00erence that\nyou\u2019ve made is, whether that means going to Kenya\nto see the Orphan Project work, or going out to see\nRichard House\u2019s amazing work with terminally ill kids.\n2) You will meet some pretty cool people. Some\npeople see it as a networking opportunity, others just\nlike the socialising. I \ufb01nd that talking to other people at\nRAG helps me stay sane! If it gets you out from behind\nyour desk and your laptop at Imperial, then it is good.\n3) You never know, you might end up \ufb01nding out\nthat you want to go into not-for-pro\ufb01t work. I started\nmy \ufb01rst year wanting go into Physics but now I think\nsomething along the lines of science for development\ncould be interesting. \u2018Social Entrepreneurship\u2019 is one\nof the new big things in the world, and there\u2019s a huge\namountoffundingforpeopleinterestedinsuchventures.\nCharity work can be a great introduction to the \ufb01eld\nand can help you \ufb01nd a product that needs developing.\n4) You can travel loads. RAG organises charity\ntrips to Kilimanjaro; I\u2019ve just got back from an attempt\nat climbing up Everest. hat\u2026 didn\u2019t go so well\u2026 but\nit was still a great experience! Friends of mine have\nbeen o\ufb00 to Kenya, South Africa and there was even\na team that went to El Salvador to volunteer this\nsummer. If you want to see the world and make a real\ndi\ufb00erence too, then sign up for one of these trips now.\n5) Volunteering recognition \u2013 not-forpro\ufb01t work is something that people are sometimes\nuncomfortable being rewarded for, but you can work\ntowards an Imperial Plus volunteering certi\ufb01cate or a\nNational Volunteering Quali\ufb01cation. Whilst these are\njust bits of paper, they recognise the development of\nimportantskillslikecommunicationanddelegationthat\nare key to not just charity work but also jobs in general.\n6) It will make you more employable! I\nhate to use the \u2018CV\u2019 word but you don\u2019t want to be\none of those people that end up sitting behind a\ndesk at their \ufb01rst job and can\u2019t communicate with\ntheir office mate to save their life. Volunteering\nwill expose you to all kinds of situations that are\nunfamiliar and will force you to develop your own\nskills. I don\u2019t think I would be nearly as con\ufb01dent\nwriting for Felix if I hadn\u2019t done any charity stu\ufb00!\nFeel free to email me if you have any questions!\nBen\nrag.treasurer@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cAre you a\npart of a club\nor society?\nOr do you go\nclubbing? Are\nyou sociable?\nDo you like\nprojects? Yes,\nYes, Yes? Then\nwrite in with\nsomething\ninteresting\nabout your\nclub, like a two\npage report\non a Chess\nTour!

If you enjoy riding,\nuse to ride or are looking to start, then\ndon\u2019t hesitate to contact us on Facebook\n(facebook.com/ImperialSb), Tumblr\n(imperialsb.tumblr.com) or Gmail\n(imperialskatebmx@gmail.com). We are\nlooking for new riders, photographers,\n\ufb01lmers, artists and anyone that\u2019s\ninterested in the local skatepark scene.\nLondon already has a large and diverse\nrange of skateparks with many more\nopening every year. he biggest and\narguably the most famous skate park in\nLondon is BaySixty6; now sponsored\nby Nike SB. his park has recently had\na complete overhaul and reopened in\nAugust this year. he new and improved\nskate facility is fully resurfaced and\nredesigned, complete with new gaps,\nhydraulic ledges and a bowl. he park is\nstill open daily, with a full day pass costing\naround \u00a310 and there are, of course,\nconcessions for beginners and for shorter\nsessions. BMX riders unfortunately\nstill have restricted access. Check the\npark\u2019s Facebook page for further details\n(http://www.facebook.com/BaySixty6).\nNew to the scene this month is the\ncouncil-funded \u00a3170k concrete skatepark\nin King George\u2019s Park (on the South\ufb01elds/\nWandsworth border). We had the\nopportunity to quickly session this park\nbefore the start of term and the verdict\nis unanimously positive. Next to the\nsite of the previous skatepark and youth\ncentre, Wandsworth Council has decided\nto invest money in constructing a new\nconcrete skate plaza and BMX track.\nhis park has pretty much anything you\ncould ever want, including: \ufb02at banks,\nquarter pipes, rails, ledges, gaps and\nreally smooth transition. To top this all\no\ufb00, the council has left the old skatepark\nin place, which further adds to the\nvariety on o\ufb00er. To ensure that the park\nhas a successful induction into the local\ncommunity, two members of sta\ufb00 are on\nsite permanently until the end of this year.\nhis park is free to ride and already has a\ngreat community of skaters and BMXers.\nIf you would like to be kept updated on\nopenings like this and what\u2019s happening\nin the local skate and BMX scene then\ncontact us or follow us on Facebook or\nTumblr. We hope to ride with you all soon!\nSkateboarding & BMX\nBART ANDREWS\n\u201c\n\u00a3170k concrete\nskatepark in King\nGeorge\u02bcs Park\n\u201c\nED BRIAL\nED BRIAL\nBart Andrews provides an SB & BMX update\n\n"

One of the escorts,\nan engineer took advantage of the\nRCSU President\u2019s state and was able\nto remove the RCSU mascot, heta\nthe hermometer, from the o\ufb03ce.\nSeveral days later the RCSU\nreceived a note from CGCU attached\nto a bag containing a rubber bolt\nwith the message: \u201chis is the closest\nyou will get this year\u201d. Eventually the\nCGCU sent a list of ransom demands\nto RCSU shortly before the Freshers\u2019\nFair including the donation of \u00a3350 to\nRAG, for the RCSU President to take\npart in the CGCU \u201cslave auction\u201d and\nfor the RCSU to advertise the CGCU\nWelcome Dinner on social media.\nDuring the Freshers\u2019 Fair the\nCGCU antagonised the RCSU by\nsending people over to their stall\nto enquire about the whereabouts\nof heta. However, towards the\nend of the event a large group of\nRCSU Exec committee members\napproached the CGCU table in order\nto steal the CGCU\u2019s Spanner and Bolt\nmascots. he CGCU stand was only\nattended by two members of CGCU\nwhich allowed the RCSU to use the\n\u201coutnumbering\u201d rule whereby if one\nparty outnumbers the other by a ratio\nof four-to-one the smaller party has\nto hand over their mascot voluntarily.\nRCSU\u2019s list of demands included\na \u00a3500 donation to RAG (initially\n\u00a3750), a Faculty email from CGCU\napologising for the theft of heta, for\nbaiting the RCSU with the rubber\nbolt, recognising the superiority of\nthe RCSU and apologising for their\npoor defence of the Spanner and\nBolt during the Freshers\u2019 Fair. he\nRCSU also demands that CGCU\nPresident Lejon Chua, the CGCU\nmascot bearers and the student who\nstole heta are all pied for charity,\nand that the \u201cthief\u201d also embarrasses\nhimself at the next RCSU Bar Night.\nhestando\ufb00betweenthetwoFaculty\nUnions is slightly overshadowed by\nthe long history behind the current\nversionofhetathehermometer.he\ncurrent version of the mascot, heta\nIV has remained \u201cinviolate\u201d a whole\n(i.e. has never been stolen in one piece)\nsince its creation in 1975 representing\nthe longest period an Imperial mascot\nhas ever been inviolate.

We felt that we should begin\nin style, dining on really good food.\nhe food and the service at the\nrestaurant were excellent; and the\nprice of the vast majority of the\nmain courses was reasonable. he\nsteaks were high, but the restaurant\nrose to the challenge. he food\nportions were generous, the waiters\nwere attentive (appearing and\ndisappearing quietly at intervals), and\nthey brought the bill in good time.\nRather oddly for a food review,\nI have nothing negative to say, and\nwe had no bones to pick with the\nrestaurant. All of those present at\nour \ufb01rst meeting would recommend\nthe Green Door Steakhouse; all of\nthe meals ordered looked excellent\n(especially the beef ribs); and\neveryone looked as though they were\nhaving fun. To not have gone there\nwould have been a missed-steak.

BOGOF/BOGOHP (Buy One\nGet One Free/Half Price) deals are\ngreat; but sometimes if they\u2019re on\nfresh produce you may not use it all in\ntime so having a food shopping buddy\nmeans you get to enjoy the deals but\nwithout as much outlay. It works for\nonline food shopping as well get a\nfew more buddies, split the delivery\ncost or try and hit free-delivery spend\namounts.\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t head o\ufb00\nshopping on an empty stomach. Many\nof us can testify that you\u2019ll end up\nspending more...\nSAVVY CHOICES\nYou don\u2019t always have to be a food/\nlabel snob. Sometimes own-brand/\nvalue-brand stu\ufb00 is on par or perhaps\nbetter than the name-brand stu\ufb00 you\n\ufb01nd in supermarkets (Basics digestives\nand smoked salmon trimmings are\nFelix Food favourites). However there\nare times where you do get what you\npay for, so you might have to have a\ntry for yourself. Do keep an open mind\nthough!\nSometimes a simple swap in the\ncut of meat can save you pounds. We\nopt for chicken thigh/drumstick meat\ninstead of breast meat sometimes\nchopped up, it\u2019s more sumptuous in\nstews and has a richer \ufb02avour. For\nprotein \ufb01ends with little to no time,\neggs and \ufb01sh are a great and cheaper\nway to keep going.\nBuy seasonal fruit and veg. We\u2019re\nsometimes guilty of violating this\nas a certain editor is a sucker for\nclementines whatever month of the\nyear we\u2019re in, but it\u2019s a lot better to\nstick to the produce that comes with\nthe seasons. Leeks and potatoes for\nAutumn/Winter, light summery veg\nfor the warmer months... your wallet\nwill thank you, and no one wants to\neat a dense casserole in summer so\nyour stomach will too!\nMake it a point to try something\nnew in terms of fruit or veg (or maybe\neven cuts of meat) once a week. It\u2019s a\ngreat way to broaden your horizons\nand prevent you from being stuck in\na food rut. You never know, you may\nend up liking it, Carol found out that\nway with beetroot! he internet is a\ngreat place to \ufb01nd out what to do with\nnovel (to you) foods/ingredients.\nMAKING THE MOST OF IT\nCook two portions in a go, don\u2019t\nbother with just one, as you\u2019ll be\nmaking and washing up the same\namount of mess. Keep one portion\nfor lunch the next day, or share with\na mate (and get them to cook the next\nday!)\nIf you\u2019re short on dosh, all-in-one\nmeals like soups, one-pan dishes or\nstir-fries are great to save on the cost.\nhere\u2019s still a way to eat cheap and\nhealthy without having to resort to pot\nnoodle (okay, we\u2019ve made pot noodle\ngourmet before in a previous issue but\nyou get our drift!).\nDon\u2019t chuck out sad-looking fruit,\ngive it a new lease of life by blitzing\nit up for smoothies/yogurt sauce,\nor maybe use it in a pudding/cake\n(banana bread, we\u2019re looking at you).\nTo keep it fresh for longer though,\nwe recommend storing bananas away\nfrom other fruit, their gases make fruit\ngo o\ufb00 faster.\nSimilarly for older veg, they tend\nto make great soup or sauce-bulking\ningredients. Or just cook them for\nlonger in a winter stew.\nInvest in a decent grater, for cheese,\nit boosts \ufb02avor and aerates it a bit so\nyou\u2019ll use less and save money. A good\ngrater helps create interest in dishes as\nwell: grated carrot and cucumber in a\ntossed salad, anyone?\nMeasure out pasta/spaghetti to cut\ndown on waste. As a handy guideline,\na standard mugful of pasta is enough\nfor one person. For spaghetti, we love\nthe spaghetti measure from Joseph\nJoseph (check out John Lewis) that can\nbe adjusted to measure out portions\n1-4 servings. It\u2019s 8 quid, but you\u2019ll\nrecoup the cost in terms of spaghetti\n(and other sauce) not wasted.\nAnd of course, the most basic\ntime-saving tip (for you chronic on-the-rush freshers)... food cooks faster\nif you chop it up into smaller bits\ninstead of larger chunks (e.g. carrots\nand potatoes for roasting/boiling/stir-frying). No one\u2019s going to be judging\nyou on whether you\u2019ve presented your\nveg in cubes or matchsticks, so unless\nyou\u2019re cooking for Gordon Ramsay it\nreally doesn\u2019t matter.\nGot a few protips of your\nown for us? We\u02bcd be happy\nto make a compilation.\nSend them over to\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEditor: Carol Ann\nCheah, Michael Yat\nKit Chung\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

He helped discover the\nlikes of Damien Hirst and Je\ufb00 Koons\nas well as giving considerable support\nto Tracey Emin, all of whom have had\nmassive success in the contemporary\nart scene.\nHe is a man who knows what he\nlikes and this is made apparent in his\nexhibition that includes the works of\n43 artists spanning 10 galleries.\nHighlights from the exhibition\ninclude Eric Manigaud\u2019s Portrait\nClinique (graphite on paper) \u2013 a\ncollection of life-size drawings\ndocumenting photographs taken in\na medical facility in Weilm\u00fcnster,\nGermany. hey poignantly depict\nphysically and mentally ill Jewish\npatients who were starved or sterilised\nunder the Nazi regime. Although\nharrowing in nature, Manigaud\u2019s\nexceptional skill brings the drawings\nto life helping to provide an insight\ninto this terrifying world.\nAnother memorable piece is\nMarcelo J\u00e1come\u2019s Planos-Pipas #17,\nliterally meaning \u2018Kite-Planes\u2019 in the\nArtist\u2019s native Portuguese. Taking up\nan entire room, it seemed to spread\nweightlessly across the space whilst\nmost certainly shouting \u201clook at\nme\u201d. A bright and colourful piece,\nconstructed from bamboo triangles\nand tissue paper, it was structured yet\nchaotic and de\ufb01nitely drew the most\nattention from visitors.\nWorth a mention, solely for the\nfact that you cannot walk around\nthe exhibition without noticing it, is\nLerma and Madera\u2019s Bust of Emanuel\nAugustus, a giant sculpture made\nof scrunched, coloured paper. \u201cEyecatching\u201d to say the least, but at over 8\nfoot high how could it not be?\nIt could be a little uninteresting\nat times, but all in all this exhibition\ndeserves merit for the fact that such\nsimple materials were manipulated to\ncreate such inspiring pieces.\nhe gallery is ideally located on the\nKing\u2019s Road, Chelsea, just a 20 minute\nwalk from the South Kensington\ncampus, and its large, bright and\nairy rooms provide an ideal escape\nfrom the frenzy that is London. Some\nmay \ufb01nd it a little pretentious, but\nwhether you are an art fan or just\nwant something to do to occupy a\nlunch break, head down to SW3 for an\ninteresting afternoon out.\n\u201cFor here they talk of nothing but\nFigaro. Nothing is played, sung or\nwhistled but Figaro. No opera is\ndrawing like Figaro. Nothing, nothing\nbut Figaro.\n\u201d\nModest Mr Mozart himself wrote\nthis shortly after the premiere of Le\nNozze Di Figaro, and though it sounds\nrather big headed, it still holds true\ntoday. Le Nozze di Figaro is one of the\nmost performed, established and well-loved pieces of opera repertoire and\nthe current Royal Opera\u2019s production\n(the fourth re-run of the 2006 version)\nperfectly showcases this.\nhe plot is a mix of two classic\nnarratives: the clever servant and\nstupid master, and the husband and\nwife deceit themes, with a good\nsprinkling of bawdy humour, cross\ndressing and proposed weddings.\nSounds like a panto, right? Wrong.\nSet to Mozart\u2019s score, this sti\ufb00,\npredictable sounding story rollicks\nalong, by turns funny, gripping and\nin many cases truly touching, making\nfor an enjoyable and gripping evening\nout.\nhe opera starts with Figaro and\nSusanna, the servant couple, preparing\nto marry, struggling with the dowry\nmoney and the Count\u2019s pervy lust for\nSusanna. he Countess meanwhile is\nfeeling lonely and abandoned and to\nadd to the mix, a teenaged servant\nis running around the castle getting\ninto steamy situations with the maids.\nFigaro, with the help of Susanna and\nthe Countess and the hindrance\nof the Count and many secondary\ncharacters, manages to wriggle out of\nall the situations he gets into, and the\nstory ends with a triple wedding and\nthe Count reconciled and in love with\nhis wife.\nLe Nozze di Figaro is based on the\nBeaumarchais\u2019 \u201cLa folle journ\u00e9e, ou\nle Mariage de Figaro\u201d, a play that\nreceived much attention on account\nof the censorship it was subjected to.\nEmbarrassing monarchs was a bit of\na sensitive subject in the 18th century\n(though possibly Prince Harry is\ntrying to revive this) and the play\u2019s\nemphasis on Figaro\u2019s intelligence\nwas considered inappropriate. he\noperating version played down Figaro\u2019s\nsocialist impulses, thus allowing it to\nevade censorship, though a few royal\neyebrows were raised at the moral\ncontent.\nDespite this, Figaro has remained\nindelibly connected to the French\nrevolution. he real strength of this\nproduction is its ability to transcend\nall of Figaro\u2019s cultural and historical\nbaggage and to revive it as what it was\noriginally intended to be: a funny yet\ntouching human story.\nAdd this to the Royal Opera House\nincredibly high production standards\nWhat: Le Nozze Di Figaro Opera\nWhere: Royal Opera House\nWhen: 2nd - 15th May 2014\nPrice: Various\nMaria Bengtsson as Countess Almaviva and Christopher Maltman as\nCount Almaviva\nand brilliant cast, and it makes Le\nNozze di Figaro a real must see -whether you\u2019re a hardened opera lover\nor a total newbie.\nCouch for a long time (2009) by Jessica Jackson Hutchins\n\n"

    "content": "FILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18 FRIDAY 11 OCT\nFasten your seatbelts... it\u2019s going to be a bumpy night\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nRush\nDirector: Ron Howard\nWriter: Peter Morgan\nStarring: Chris Hemsworth, Daniel\nBr\u00fchl, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria\nLara\nRuntime: 123 minutes\nCertification: 15\nThere is something so intensely vigorous and exciting about Ron Howard\u2019s\nFormula 1 biopic Rush. Focusing on\nBritish driver James Hunt (Hems-worth, excellent) and his rivalry with\nthe German Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl, a worthy opponent), here is a winning film\nthat concentrates on having fun as\nwell as staying on course to develop its\ncharacters.\nIn portraying Hunt and Lauda, that\nthey\u2019re the complete opposite in nature works to the film\u2019s advantage in\ncreating a fun dynamic. Hunt is the\nboozy, womanising, vomits-before-every-race kind of playboy, whereas\nLauda, who seems to know everything\nthere is to know about cars, is a much\nmore grounded, serious, hardworking\ntype, whose only romantic streak with\nthe opposite gender can be hilariously\nsummed up in his \u201cproposal\u201d for mar-riage: \u201cit might as well be you\u201d he says\nto his future wife. So we\u2019re all quite\nshocked when she says yes.\nTogether they start on the lower\nend of the racing world. But slowly\nworking their way up, they eventually\nreach the Formula 1 racetracks. And\nthrough the first act or so it feels as\nthough a lot of the deep-rooted personal histories of the two drivers leading up to this point have been glossed\nover, most possibly in favour of the\nadrenaline-fuelled race sequences to\ncome.\nBut a lot can be forgiven when the\ntechnically sound, highly watchable\nand entertaining scenes hit the screen.\nThe engines start roaring, the tyres\nstart rolling, and backed by the thundering score of Hans Zimmer, off they\ngo, risking their lives on the deadly\ntracks, and it\u2019s this sense of uncertain danger that adds an unbearable\namount of tension, particularly more\nso for individuals not familiar with the\nsport in the first place. The cars moves\nat an immense speed, and with each\ncurve, each near-fatal-crash, the awe-inspiring wow factor is without doubt\nthe film\u2019s highlight. Howard places his\ncameras accordingly for maximum\nviewing experience, sometimes within\nthe driver\u2019s seat as well, so the audience gets a first-hand glimpse of what\nit\u2019s like inside the helmet.\nA major life event the film wisely\nchooses to spend some time on is\nLauda\u2019s catastrophic crash at the 1976\nWorld Championship in Germany.\nWith significant burns and multiple\nserious injuries, Lauda is left fighting\nfor his life. And in a gut-wrenching\nseries of scenes that quite graphically\nshows this struggle, it\u2019s impossible not\nto sympathise for the helpless man,\nmore so when his devastated wife\nMarlene (Lara) looks on from a dis-tance. But without ever milking the\ndense, heavy emotions, the film carefully explores what must have been\nLauda\u2019s most painful, difficult weeks,\nwhilst also reminding the audience of\nthe races that are still happening without the German driver.\nHemsworth and Br\u00fchl don\u2019t share\nas many scenes together as you\u2019d expect \u2013 and frankly there isn\u2019t a lot of\ndramatic showdown between the two\nother than on the racetrack itself. The\nbehind-the-scenes rivalry between\nthe two isn\u2019t well captured initially,\nmostly due to the fact that the film\nalso has their personal lives to juggle\nonce the drivers\u2019 fame and money kick\nin, but their love-hate bromance-type\nrelationship does build up eventu-ally, which leads to some very genuine\nheartfelt scenes in which we realise\nperhaps they did need one another for\nthat extra drive and push.\nThe two women standing by on each\nof the driver\u2019s side is the aforementioned Marlene and English model/\nsocialist Suzy Hunt (Wilde, sporting\na mighty fine English accent), who\ncatches Hunt\u2019s eyes. Together they\nfurther shape the personal lives of the\ndrivers, injecting some fiery drama\nand at times, some well-placed humour stemming from events occurring away from the tracks.\nIn the end with both their likable\nqualities, it doesn\u2019t matter a huge deal\nwhen it comes to who eventually takes\nthe trophy home. Lauda is ahead on\npoints prior to his accident, and during his stay at the hospital for recov-ery, Hunt gains in on the ranks. The\ndeciding race at Fuji in Japan, under\nfrighteningly harsh weather condi-tions, is a final race worthy of putting\na close to such an electric, exhilarating\n\u201cbased on a true story\u201d biopic.\nTurbo\nDirector: David Soren\nWriters: Darren Lemke, Robert D.\nSiegel, David Soren\nStarring: (voices) Ryan Reynolds,\nPaul Giamatti, Samuel L. Jackson,\nMichael Pe\u00f1a\nRuntime: 96 minutes\nCertification: U\nFor Theo, aka Turbo (Reynolds), being\na snail is hardly something that will\nkeep him from dreaming of becoming\na successful, celebrated racer. Staying\nup night after night watching his idol\nhuman driver Guy Gagn\u00e9 (Bill Hader,\neffectively laying on the cheese) spew\nout inspirational monologues, Turbo\ntoo, wishes to compete in the annual\nIndy 500 race.\nAnd of course, due to exceptional\ncircumstances that involves Turbo\ndrinking some dodgy nitrous oxide\nfrom a sports car, he finds a way to enter the competition, which puts him in\ndirect competition with his hero.\nOf course, the plot is as preposterous and laughable as they come, a tiny\nlittle snail whizzing past Ferraris to\nactually compete in the real world, but\nonce you can take in the fact that this\nis a DreamWorks Animation\u2019s movie\naimed mainly for children and hopefully the more open-minded adults,\nthe film succeeds in creating a vibrant,\ncolourful atmosphere for audiences of\na wide demographic to enjoy.\nWhen the race is on, it marks the\nfilm\u2019s finest moment - as Turbo dodges obstacles, slides under cars, and\nskillfully navigates his way around the\ntrack - the camera moves at a rapid\npace to keep up with all the action that\nis happening, and with all the noise\nand excitement, it\u2019s impossible not to\nbe swept up by the sheer level of energy that turns out to become more\ninfectious than you would have ever\nimagined.\nTurbo gets a friendly little support\ngang together prior to his big show-down: snails he meets at a taco truck,\nowned by kind-hearted Mexican Tito\n(Pe\u00f1a) who makes it a hobby to collect snails (and no, never inhumanely\nso) and race them with his friends at\na struggling run-down strip mall. And\nvoiced by the excellent supporting\ncast that consists of Smauel L. Jackson\nwho never disappoints, as well as Michelle Rodriguez and Ken Jeong, Turbo finds room for humour as our lead\ncharacter finds friendship and playful\ndialogue when he isn\u2019t showing off his\nnew skills and his snazzy blue glowing shell (a side-effect of the nitrous\noxide).\nLess fun is the family aspect the film\nfocuses on. Turbo has an older brother\nChet (Giamatti) who constantly tries\nto put a stop to his younger brother\u2019s\ncrazy dreams. This same fraternal relationship is further echoed in Tito\u2019s\nlife story, as he too, has a disapproving older brother who is the sensible\nrealist having to shout at his younger\nhermano for not selling enough tacos.\nWhen the message of following your\ndream, your passion, and your heart is\nhammered home, it\u2019s at times difficult\nto have any sympathy left for the characters when it truly matters.\nBut in the end the message is a\nhealthy, supposed-to-be-heart-warm-ing one, something that can be taken\nin by both children and adults alike,\nwith a voice cast diverse and funny\nenough to entertain throughout, lead\nby the always-reliable Reynolds.\nAside from turning the table on how\none of the slowest creatures on the\nplanet ends up as one of the fastest,\nthere are very few original ideas and\nimaginative developments to make\nthis extra special - but to pass the time\nwith a visually thrilling feature, there\u2019s\nnothing safer than a harmless bit of\nno-thoughts-required animation.\n\n"

Surely it can\u2019t be too early,\nthey do realise we were students right?\nWrong. Alarms set for between 4.30\nand 5 o\u2019clock, we made our way bright\neyed and bushy tailed (okay that was\na slight lie) to catch the \ufb01rst of our\ntwo buses to get to the venue. Now\nnormally bus journeys don\u2019t make it\ninto match reports, but ours makes\na brief appearance for two reasons;\n\ufb01rstly in memory of the much missed\nJean Claude, the \u2018porridge-in-apot\u2019 made several appearances and\nsecondly for the adventures of Sophie\nKirk. Normally the most organised of\npeople, we found it slightly surprising\nwhen she missed our arranged\nmeeting time and thus the 211. Fear\nnot, she will get the next bus and\ncatch the subsequent one to London\nFields? Wrong again. Due to the Royal\nParks half marathon taking place that\nTriathlon Club make a splash at Aquathlon\nICU TRIATHLON CLUB\nJames Ellis documents TriClub\u02bcs trials on land, buses, and water in an epic battle against their competitors\nmorning (shout out to Harriet, a Tri\nmember competing) diversions were\nbeginning to take operation and time\nwas beginning to get short. Having\npulled a sprint out the bag that Bolt\nwould have been proud of, Sophie\njust missed catching us in the walk\nbetween stops and was now in danger\nof missing the event. At this point she\nhailed down a cab and uttered the line\nin true \ufb01lm fashion \u2013 \u2018follow that bus!\u2019\nTo cut to the chase; one cab driver\ndoing a good Lewis Hamilton\nimpersonation, a quick-\ufb01re bit of\ntransition practise between cab and\nbus at one of the stops and a round of\napplause later and the team was \ufb01nally\ncomplete. Drama over, for now at\nleast, we progressed to the venue and\ncompleted the registration process.\nhe swim went o\ufb00 in a staggered start,\nwith the \ufb01rst of the 200 competitors\ntaking to water just after 8 AM with\nswimmers entering at 20 second\nintervals. Done on a \u2018fastest-\ufb01rst\u2019\nbasis, Sophie was the premier member\nof TriIC attacking the 400m outdoor\npool swim. She was swiftly followed\nby Charlie Houston before the trio\nof Vicki Solly, Marcel Admiraal and\nFran Capel all in one after another.\nWith the cluster demonstrating some\nsmooth technique, a bit of intra-club\nrivalry helped to spur them on to\nexcellent performances. Dropping\ndown the order a bit to our slightly\nless gifted swimmers - I can write this\nas I\u2019m very much a \ufb01sh out of water\nin the pool (that sounded better in\nmy head) \u2013 Ed Hallett, American\nnewbie Alejandro Baez and myself\nwere underway. By this point Sophie\nwas coming to the completion of\nher 5 x 1km loops, all of which was\nable to be caught on camera by Mike\nKaye who was timetabled to enter the\nwater 135/200 of the competitors. At\nthis point the starting order system\nshould be explained; during the\nonline registration process you had to\ngive your estimated time for a 400m\nswim and everyone was then ranking\naccordingly. Not knowing his 400m\ntime, Mike \u2013 a PhD student \u2013 scaled\ndown a time from his 750m swim at\nthe BUCS sprint triathlon. Slightly\nsurprised at his position on arrive\nMike rechecked his estimate and\nrealised the 10mins should actually\nhave been more like 6mins 20 which\nwould have him right at the front of the\nrace. hank goodness Imperial isn\u2019t a\nuniversity which relies on numerical\ncompetency\u2026 It should be pointed\nout Mike did give a masterclass when\nhe eventually entered the water!\nMoving onto the run section and\ndi\ufb00erent strengths of the athletes\nbegan to show through, with some\nmuch better runners than swimmers.\nhis, combined with the \ufb01ve lap\nnature of the course, meant everyone\ngets well and truly mixed up making\nit hard to know your true position in\nthe race. hus it was simply a matter\nof grinding it out and making the\nmost of a crisp Sunday morning.\nEveryone showed remarkable grit\nand determination, with the likes of\nCharlie seeming to get round looking\nrelatively (or you could say annoyingly)\nuntroubled. I\u2019d like to say I joined him\nin this, however I took a liking to the\npool water and managed to swallow\nquite a lot of it, which then made the\nrun rather challenging! Ultimately we\nall crossed the line in various states of\ndisrepair, managed to grab a handful\nof complementary cake and stumble\nover to join the rest of the TriIC\nA lot of hard work, multiple bruises, a\ndevilishpubquizandonebrokennose...\nImperial\u2019s Shorinji Kempo club\norganised this year\u2019s highly-successful BSKF (British Shorinji\nKempo Federation) summer camp in\nChiswick. he two-day event in early\nSeptember was attended by more\nthan seventy Kempo practitioners\n(kenshi) and some top Kempo Senseis\nfrom Britain and Japan. Participants\ncrew. Marcel even managed to grab a\nfree massage at the \ufb01nish too, which\nappeared to go down a treat, before\nwe all did the mandatory club photo.\nWhilst staring into the sun caused a\nfew eyes to be forced open, the smiles\nwere not, due to the satisfaction of\ncompletion and the legendry Tri club\natmosphere.\nStill not complete with our day, we\nheaded o\ufb00 to the pub where the prize\ngiving was to take place \u2013 and no\nwe did not have a tipple, we\u2019re elite\nathletes \u2013 with Sophie in particular in\nthe running for medals. Alas it didn\u2019t\nturn out to be the case, although some\nhiccups had already surfaced with the\nresults, which as of writing have not\nbeen released outside the current top\nthree. So I think this should really go\ndown as a TBC. Everyone is eagerly\nawaiting the results so we can analyse\nour times in each section (we\u2019re\nImperial students after all, what else\nwould we do with a load of data?), but\neither way I can safely say on behalf\nof everyone it was a fun event to be\npart of. As a Tri club \ufb01rst-timer I was\nmore than welcomed into the team\n(ignoring the blatant segregation on\nthe bus) and we are very grateful to\nLondon Fields Tri Club for organising\nwhat was a very successful event.\nAppetite suitably whetted for the\nyear, I for one can\u2019t wait to kick on\nwith training and throw myself into\nmore races over the coming term \u2013 as\nsuch, anyone who has ever thought\nabout triathlon, come and try some\nof the sessions out! he club is a very\nwelcoming one, Ed as chairman is\ndoing a wonderful job developing it\nand ultimately it\u2019s a great laugh with a\ngreat bunch of people. Email triath@\nimperial.ac.uk to \ufb01nd out more!\nenjoyed some quality Kempo\ninstruction in sparring (randoori), soft\ntechniques (juho), hard techniques\n(goho), healing massage (seiho), set\nmoves (kata) and philosophy (howa)\nAs well as kenshi from Britain\nand Ireland, we were joined by a\ncontingent of Czechs from Prague\ndojo, which was set up by Imperial\nalumnus Tomas Bystron who gained\nhis black belt (1st dan) at Imperial\nSaturday\u2019s training included teaching\non how to do a perfect ninja\nforward role (mae ukemi) amongst\nother techniques. here was some\nbloodshed as one instructor su\ufb00ered a\nbroken nose that was quickly tweaked\nback into place by Sensei Mizuno\n(8th dan), the BSKF\u2019s chief instructor.\nSensei Mizuno\u2019s later philosophy\nsession talked about the healing\npowers of seiho (kempo\u2019s healing\nmassage techniques) and kenshi were\ninvited to perform some leg seiho.\nOnly on one leg, though, as a test to\nsee by comparing leg aches and pains\nif seiho really works! Reports di\ufb00er...\nSaturday night was (of course)\nspent in the pub. Sensei Sean from\nImperial had devised a \ufb01endish\nmartial arts pub quiz, including a\npicture round (Can YOU recognise\na picture of Chow Yun Fat at \ufb01fty\npaces?) and some very obscure\ntrivia. he winning team received\na bottle of Sake for their e\ufb00orts.\nSunday\u2019s training involved punching\npractise using pads for full-force\nblows, randoori practise and kata\npractise. hat afternoon, kenshi were\ntreated to some demonstrations\nincluding three-against-one \ufb01ghting\nand a skilled pairform demonstration\n(embu) using bo sta\ufb00 (shakujo).\nKenshi departed on Sunday evening\nfeeling tired and bruised, but having\nlearnt some great Kempo. Imperial\nkenshi left safe in the knowledge\nof a job well done. Done so well, in\nfact, that Imperial dojo has been\nasked to organise next year\u2019s BSKF\n40th anniversary celebrations, too!\nhe success of the summer camp for\nus at Imperial completes a great year\nfor ICU Shorinji Kempo. he club\u2019s\nbaking raised over \u00a3400 for charity,\nand we attracted more new members\nthan ever before. Eight new kenshi\ngained their yellow belts and three\nof our instructors, including Imperial\nalumnus Aled, gained their 2nd dan\nin Shorinji Kempo. Former captain\nMaks gained his black belt (1st dan)\nalongside fellow \u2018\ufb02ying moustache\u2019\nand treasurer Aditya. You may\nremember this dynamic duo from\nthe BSKF national demonstration\n(Tai Kai) last November, where their\npairform demonstration (embu) won\n\ufb01rst place. Imperial Shorinji Kempo\nis also now (based on the number of\npaid-up BSKF members) the biggest\nBSKF dojo. All in all a fantastic year,\nlet\u2019s hope for more of the same.\nShorinji Kempo trains on Saturdays\n1-3pm in the Union Gym and\nhursdays 6-8pm in Activity Space 1\nSummer camp success\nfor ICU Shorinji Kempo\nEmma King reports back from the\nBritish Shorinji Kempo Fedoration camp\n\n"

Go you, young fresher,\nmaking friends with other people who like the same physical\nactivity as you- this is going to\nform the best foundation for everlasting friendship!

Philippa introduced\nme as a \u2018bubbling biologist\u2019 last week, which is an exaggeration, but true\nto form this week\u2019s news story that has struck me is a biological one.\nI strongly dislike common wasps. So it\u2019s not di\ufb03cult to understand\nthat the concept of gigantic, venomous, aggressive wasps that can\nkill you make me glad that I live in Britain. Inhabit a place where a\nspecies whose queens can grow to be over 5cm long? No thanks.\nDespitethis,reportsthathornetsareresponsibleforover40deathsandatleast1600\ninjuriesintheChineseprovinceofShaanxithissummerhavemeweirdlyenthralled.\nHornetattacksareafactoflifeinthearea,butthisyear\u2019sattacksareunprecedented\nin number and severity. It\u2019s not hard to \ufb01nd photographs of unfortunate\nvictims on the Internet. heir wounds look like small necrotic bullet holes.\nDeaths are being attributed to both the Asian giant hornet and the Asian\npredatory wasp. he Asian giant hornet\u2019s sting is the most venomous wasp\nsting known. he venom is capable of destroying red blood cells and thus\ncausing kidney failure and death. Even if one hasn\u2019t received a fatal dose of\nvenom many su\ufb00er an allergic response and may die of anaphylaxis. he\nAsian predatory wasp is smaller but incredibly aggressive \u2013 people have\ndescribed being chased for hundreds of metres by swarms of these hornets.\nhere is a lot of blame going around regarding the high number of attacks. he\nauthorities have pointed to a prolonged period of dry and warm weather that\nhas allowed hornet colonies to thrive. Environmentalists blame urbanisation\nof habitat where hornets build their nests. Others have cited additional\necological factors like a reduction in the numbers of hornets\u2019 natural enemies.\nhe combination of these issues has surely led to the situation the Chinese people\n\ufb01nd themselves in this year. Unfortunately it cannot be \ufb01xed peacefully. Hornets\nhave their numbers and their venom. Humans have hospitals and \ufb02amethrowers.\nWho will win? Well, in the end humans always win. As a biologist\nthat saddens me. Yet I can\u2019t help it; the instinctive and sel\ufb01sh part\nof me looks at an Asian giant hornet and thinks, \u201cGood riddance.\u201d\nHype, hope and headlines\nFiona\u2019s science corner\nhe relationship between scientists,\nthemediaandthepublicisfraughtwith\nthe dangers of miscommunication\nand exploitation. he question of\nwhere the responsibility must lie\nwhen a patient becomes a victim\nis not easily answered. his is\nparticularly true of fertility research,\nan area that touches on one of the\nmost profound aspects of all our lives.\nWhile some of us may be more\nimpatient than others for the dawn\nof quantum computing, the wait is\nunlikely to have any personal cost.\nhe same is not true of fertility\nresearch where the cost is the chance\nof parenthood and the temporal\nwindow is not even a lifetime, but\nthe reproductive cycle of a woman.\nNew technologies can take decades to\nbe developed from concept to \ufb01nished\nproduct, for some families waiting\nfor the gold standard of proof in\nclinical trials, randomized controlled\ntesting, this is not an option. he\nurgent nature of fertility treatment\ndemands a more nuanced evaluation\nof evidence. he question is then,\nwho is responsible for this? Should\nscientists and doctors withhold\nunproven results? Is it the role of\na science journalist to identify bad\nresearch? Or is the patient ultimately\nresponsible for their own decisions?\nSome argue that all scienti\ufb01c\nresearch should be open access,\nwe shouldn\u2019t patronise the public\nthrough censorship. he minimum\nrequirement is factual, well referenced\nreporting. It is the patient\u2019s role\nto undertake their own research\nand weigh up evidence against\npotential risk and cost utilising\npublic guidelines such as those\nissued by NICE (National Institute\nof Health and Care Excellence).\nHowever it is doctors who have the\naccess to treatments and the expertise\nto best advise their patients, putting\nthem ultimately in the position of\npower. An uncomfortable tension\nthen arises between scienti\ufb01c integrity\nand good business. Is it exploitative\nfor a clinician to o\ufb00er an expensive\nbut unproven treatment to a desperate\nfamily? Or for a research group to\nportray their results in a favourable\nlight in order to garner more funding?\nWhat\u2019s more private clinics driven\nby commercial interest o\ufb00er many\ntreatments unavailable on the NHS.\nhis creates a consumer-led industry\nthat knocks scienti\ufb01c progress o\ufb00\ncourse, to the detriment of future\ngenerations. If the newest treatments\ncan always be demanded, there is no\nbody of patients to undertake large\nclinical trials and evidence for existing\ntreatments will get weaker and weaker.\nhere is a disjuncture between the\nconception of the general public\nof science as an orthodox body\nof knowledge and the reality that\nclinical trials are extremely sensitive\nand interpreting results is not\nstraightforward. Journalists, hungry\nfor heart-pounding stories of miracle\nbabies and with deadlines to meet,\noften widen rather than resolve this\ngulf. A good science journalist must\ntake some responsibility, as mediator\nbetween expert and lay-person, to\nreport tentative results with caution.\nIt is perhaps the duty of the science\nwriter to report all progress, however\nincremental. But small steps can too\noften translate as a \u2018breakthrough\nnew technology\u2019 in print.\nhese issues were all discussed at\na recent debate held by PET, the\nProgress Educational Trust, who seek\nto in\ufb02uence policy on ethical issues\nin science. he debate concluded that\naccountability must be held by all in\ntheinformationstream.hetakehome\nmessage - pause before you publish.\nJamie Rickman\nScience Writer\nhe Imperial male is very much\na wonder to behold. What this\npopulation lacks in female\ncompanionship is makes up with a\nmultitude of complex social rituals;\nwhether it is the drinking circles of the\nrugby team, the LAN parties of the\ncomputer scientists or the Friday night\npizza fest down in the sci-\ufb01 library.\nIt may not come as a surprise that the\nmating mannerisms of the Imperial\nmale contrasts with a sexual ferocity\nrecently discovered in a much smaller,\nusually more docile species - the\nmarsupial mouse. A study published\nthis week and conducted by the\nUniversity of Queensland, Australia,\nfound that marsupial mice were\nmating with such vigour and intensity\nthat they then died due to disease or\neven just from exhaustion. Known as\nsuicidal reproduction, or semelparity,\nthese marsupials were observed\nkeeling over simultaneously in large\nMarsupials don\u2019t stop until they drop\nnumbers after the breeding season.\nSemelparity is often a mechanism\nadapted for organisms with short\nbreeding seasons or those that\nexperience \ufb02uctuations in food\navailability. Females are thought to\ntime breeding sessions to correspond\nto peaks in certain insect populations,\nto ensure both the maximal survival\nof the mother and her undeveloped\nyoung that will require weeks\nof care. hey therefore are only\navailable for mating once a year,\nand for these mice a year can be a\nlong and perilous road for survival.\nhe male mice therefore put all they\nhave (literally and \ufb01guratively) into\nmating during this temporarily open\nslot (again, literally and \ufb01guratively).\nhey may mate continuously for\n12 hours or more until passing out\nfrom exhaustion - the parallel to this\nbehaviour is often seen in Imperial\nmales as they study throughout\nthe night in the Wolfson suite.\nhe di\ufb00erence is that the e\ufb00orts\nof the mouse are more likely to be\nmuch more fruitful- producing\no\ufb00spring, despite risking death is\nmore rewarding that the low 2.2 the\nImperial male may be laundered with\nafter handing in that subpar lab report.\nDue to such a short fertility\nwindow, female marsupial mice are\nalso highly promiscuous to ensure\nthe production of o\ufb00spring for the\nfuture. Coupled with the competition\nof a whole host of horny suicidal\nmales, this breeding season leads\nto a sexual frenzy, something akin\nto that only seen at seasonal balls\nwith gregariously large bar tabs\nand no 9am lectures the next day.\nhe marsupial males only have one\nshot, and pour everything they have\ninto making it truly deliver. hey\nconcentrate all biological e\ufb00orts into\nproducing particularly potent sperm\nat the cost of their immune system\nstrength, resulting in an increased\nsusceptibility to disease after mating\nseason. his is not experienced in\nthe female population, so males will\ninevitably su\ufb00er and die in large\nnumbers whilst females may live for\na number of years and breed again\nFor these male mice, with there\nAre you dying for sex? Philippa Skett tells us that if you compare yourself to\nmale marsupial mice, you really aren\u02bct\nCathy Wilcox\nbeing no selectional pressure for\nprolonged survival, this pattern of\nsemelparity is set to continue long into\nthe evolutionary future. Fortunately,\nthe same cannot be said for the\nImperial male, as once they leave the\ncon\ufb01nes of the university community,\nthey generally metamorphose into\na more respected, social member of\nthe wider population and can use\nhumour, charm, looks and a large\ncity wage to secure a mate instead.\nIt is debatable as to which male of\neither species is more successful, as\nalthough the marsupial mouse seems\nto have a sex life that is more exciting\nthan an average imperial male,\ntheir lives in general are very much\nshorter. Personally, I think that until\na marsupial mouse secures a graduate\nscheme placement at Goldman Sachs,\ntheImperialmalestilltriumphsoverall.\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.1310691110\nGetty Images\nSCIENCE\n\n"

As more of the characters\u2019 complex, intertwined past\nwasrevealed,themoreenrichedeveryone\u2019s background story became.\nWith enough flashback sequences to\nexplain and unmask various people\u2019s\ntrue intentions, Season 2 was setting\nup as though the residents of Storybrooke were finally ready to move on\nwith their lives.\nWith a flash of mystical-looking\npurple smoke, magic re-entered StorybrookeintheSeason1finale,along\nwith everyone\u2019s memories, and soon\nafter we find that the inhabitants are\nrightly out for blood: Regina\u2019s blood.\nBut hold on, we\u2019re not just interested\nin Storybrooke here.\nBack we go to the magical fantasy kingdom to be introduced to\nPrincess Aurora (Sarah Bolger), aka\nSleeping Beauty, who, as her name\nsuggests, doesn\u2019t do anything, Mulan\n(JamieChung),akatheChinesePrin-cess, who you\u2019d think would be able\nto put up a decent fight, but doesn\u2019t,\nand Prince Philip (Julian Morris), aka\nAurora\u2019s boyfriend, who\u2019s as useless\nif not more so, than his narcoleptic\ngirlfriend. These are the good guys,\nalthough at times it\u2019s hard to see how\nexactly they contribute. The new bad\nguys? Cora (Barbara Hershey), Regina\u2019s witch mother who\u2019s twice the\nbitch her daughter is, and Captain\nHook (Colin O\u2019Donoghue) - these\ntwoareplottingacomeback,eagerto\ntransport themselves to Storybrooke\nto wreak havoc.\nWith two parallel narratives to jug-gle, did we really need a third? Yes,\nwe absolutely did. Piling on to the\noverlong, overly complicated struc-ture, the writers clearly felt there was\na need to link everyone to everyone\nelse, making Lost seem like a trivial,\nsmall-scale drama. With season 1\nthe characters, along with the audi-ence, had no idea who they were.\nNow with everything restored back\nto normal, as well as the audience\ngetting a firm grasp on who\u2019s loved/\nkissed/betrayed/killed whom, the\nwriters could have dialled it back on\nall the highly irrelevant flashbacks.\nThe show never seems to know\nwhen to leave the past alone. It\nwould appear Regina and Snow\nWhite (Ginnifer Goodwin) are constantly trying to kill each other over\nwhat feels like a hundred years, with\nCharming (Jos80h Dallas - dull,\ncorny, and hardly ever heroic) popping by for a few showdowns; but\nthat\u2019s not all, Regina\u2019s past with Cora\ncomplicates things, and so does the\nentrance of Snow White\u2019s mother.\nRegina has a past connection with\nCaptain Hook, he holds a grudge\nagainst Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle), who has a thing for Belle (Emi-lie de Ravin), who is also a target of\nHook, Belle also met Mulan and Red\nRiding Hood in the past, etc, etc. You\nthink you get the full picture? Look\nagain,andyou\u2019llrealiseaslongasthis\nshow goes on, you\u2019ll never know for\nsure just who is involved with what\nwhen and where. Whereas season 1\ntook very neat, clever approaches to\nlinking various characters together,\nnow everything seems far-fetched\nand a touch desperate in an attempt\nto squeeze absolutely everyone into\nthe plot.\nEmma Swan (Jennifer Morrison)\nand her mother Mary Margaret/\nSnow White have some quality\nmother-daughter bonding session\nwhen they inadvertently find themselves away from Storybrooke, al-thoughaftersomehorrendouslybad,\nchildish \u201caction\u201d scenes they\u2019re back\nwhere they belong united with their\nfamily; which is when they really\nstart laying on the cheese. The whole\n\u201cI see good in you\u201d\n, \u201cthere\u2019s good in\neveryone\u201d\n, \u201cyou have a good heart\u201d\n\u201cbe a good person no matter what\u201d\nangle grows more tiresome than\nGlee\u2019s endless weekly message of \u201cbe\nyourself\u201d\n, as residents of Storybrooke\nshow they need a big reality check\nwhen it comes to life in general.\nOn the plus side the one character\nthe show could do without, Rumpelstiltskin/Mr Gold, has every chance\nto flourish in his self-centred, duplic-itous schemes. Although standing\nby his side is the irritating Belle, who\nacts as the lead spokeswoman of the\n\u201cbe good\u201d campaign.\nCora and Hook, who are up to\nno good, add some fresh dynamic\ninto the otherwise dull narrative.\nHershey absolutely nails her role\nas she channels hints of her similar\n\u201cmother-from-hell\u201d character from\nBlack Swan, and O\u2019Donoghue shows\nhe\u2019s more than just a pretty-face eye-candy with a different accent for the\nladies who make up a large percentage of the demographic.\nIt\u2019s a show full of ups and downs,\nbut given the abundance of material,\nit really should be better. Be bold and\nkill off a few characters, less focus\non the past, more driving forward\nwith the present storylines, and who\nknows, some flashforwards, which\nserved Lost so well during its mid-series struggle, might do some good\nfor a series that is growing stale very\nquickly. The season 2 finale promises\nadventure into a new realm, with a\nsuper-villain (who can fly, who can\nfly, who can fly) who is bound to be a\ncunning, conniving man-child (hint,\nhint). So here\u2019s to hoping some mag-icwillbebroughtbackintotheworld\nof OUAT.\n25\nFRIDAY 11 OCT\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\n\n"
