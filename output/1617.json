After an easy ride\nso far in the league, Imperial were\nhoping for an opposition that would\nprovide some serious competition to\ntest the lads\u2019 capabilities. After the\nfirst few minutes it was clear that\nthis was not going to be the case.All\nit took were a few good phases and\nsolid line breaks in the opposition\n22 for IC to cross the white wash\nearly on.\nImperial were up against a side\nwith big runners, but this threat was\ncut off at source with good tackling\nfrom the team all around. We were\nable to punch some holes ourselves,\nwith big running from the back line.\nCaptain Gavin Roberts also proved\nhimself very difficult to stop, with\nhis small stature and quick legs hard\nto follow, sometimes even by his\nown team. Backs moves flowed well,\noften being finished by the wheels\non winger Will Goldberg. The rest\nof the game went on in a similar\nfashion, with four tries completed\nby the end of the first half.\nNominated goal kicker, Kieran\nDonnelly, had a good game off the\ntee, bar failing to slot one directly\nin front of the posts, blaming\nchat from the opposition for his\nmisdemeanour.\nAfter the first half, it was clear\nthat Imperial were the dominant\nside. The second half started with\nImperial tries, and finished with\nImperial tries. IC finally met some\ngood competition in the scrums,\nbut after 60 minutes they went\nuncontested following a knock\nto the head taken by opposition\nhooker. A clean sheet was kept\nthanks to a solid D all around from\nthe boys, and in particular, good\ncover tackles from Carlos Sheppard.\nThe forwards played well as a pack,\nbeing dominant in the lineouts in\nboth attack and defence, and also in\nthe scrum with awesome steals from\nhooker, John Welsh.\nTowards the end of the match,\nImperial were playing against a\n13-man side after two opposition\nplayers went off with injury with no\none to replace them \u2013 perhaps an\nunnecessary additional advantage\nfor College. To everyone\u2019s relief, the\nmatch was called off five minutes\nearly after two tries in quick\nsuccession from IC, and that was it.\nFinal score 65-0.

The end-of-winter term is when this becomes\nmost apparent, with almost every\nroom on campus filled with\nperformances put on by our myriad\nsocieties.\nFor most groups, this will be the\nfirsttimetheyarelettingtheirnewest\nmembers loose on a live audience,\nso it\u2019s all a healthy mix of nerves\nand anticipation. This is especially\nthe case for certain groups with\nmembers who have just graduated,\nleaving only half of their previous\nmembership intact. For many, this\nwill be the first performance that\nreally shows how well they\u2019re doing\nwithout old members.\nMany of you must have\nencountered the talent of Musical\nTheatre and DramaSoc with their\nperformances in the Union Concert\nHall (shows on 2nd\n- 4th\nDecember\nand 7th\n- 12th\nDecember respectively),\nand the more classically-oriented\nSymphony and Sinfonietta with\nperformances in the Great Hall\n(27th\nNovember and 4th\nDecember\nrespectively). However, it\u2019s the\nwhole host of groups that disappear\noff campus you should look out for\ntoo, as you might miss a real treat\notherwise.\nFor example, both Chamber\nChoir and Choir have their Autumn\nconcerts in the Holy Trinity Church\non the 19th\nand 22nd\nNovember\nrespectively, and that\u2019s not even\nhalf of what to expect. Make sure\nyou indulge yourself in the ultimate\nend-of-year line-up!\nBrace yourself for End-of-Term\nAbigail de Bruin\nClubs & Societies Editor\nMusical Theatre Society living it up in last year\u2019s show.

If\nyou think of \u2018that\nguy\u2019 at a party, sloppily doing lame\ntricks he learnt an hour ago from\nYoutube, then I\u2019m here to change\nthat. If you imagine a sad man in\nhis thirties doing kids\u2019 parties, filled\nwith self-loathing due to poor life\ndecisions, then I\u2019m here to change\nthat too.\nUnfortunately, these common\ngeneralisations of magic are mostly\ntrue, but I\u2019d like to attempt to show\nyou a glimpse from deeper inside\nthe rabbit hole. There aren\u2019t any\nflying broomsticks, but hopefully\nthere\u2019s something you\u2019ll find cool,\nperhaps even beautiful.\nI\u2019ll attempt to show you some\npowerful magic, not by showing you\nthe coolest trick,but by showing you\nthe kind of wonderful experience\na spectator can have. If you type\n\u201cDerren Brown mystery box\u201d into\nYoutube, then you\u2019ll find a two\npart video of a routine from one of\nDerren\u2019s brilliant stage shows. Pay\nspecial attention to the spectators\u2019\nreactions, and don\u2019t read the\nYoutube comments unless you want\na thousand incorrect theories about\nthe trick\u2019s method.\nI\u2019m almost certain that you won\u2019t\nhave bothered to actually go to\nYoutube to look up the video, so\nI\u2019ll attempt to describe it in words.\nDerren invites a random member of\nthe audience who has lost an older\nrelative on stage. The spectator\u2019s\nname is Emma, and the relative is\nher grandmother, Doris. Derren\nthen tells a story in which his own\ngrandfather kept an old wooden\nbox on his shelf, and told Derren\nthat he should never, under any\ncircumstances, open the box. We\nalways want what we can\u2019t have,\nand obviously he wanted more than\nanything to know what was inside.\nAfter a couple of years, his\ngrandfather passed away, and\nDerren was left with this box, and\nwas finally able to see what was\ninside. To his surprise, the box\ncontained a coin, made of solid\nsilver, with 7 words engraved on it.\nThe words were, \u201cDerren I told you\nnot to look\u201d.\nYou can imagine why this became\none of Derren\u2019s prized possessions,\nand this story becomes the catalyst\nfor the magical plot about to follow.\nOn stage is a locked box,and Emma\nis given the key. She opens the box,\nand inside is another silver coin.\nThis time, engraved on the coin, are\nYou mean this wasn\u2019t your card? Nooooo! Photo Credit: Infamous PR\nJonny Zheng\nWriter Hopefully\nthere\u2019s\nsomething\nyou\u2019ll\nfind cool,\nperhaps\neven\nbeautiful\nDo you want to see a magic trick?\nMagicians, assemble!\nthe words, \u201cIn loving memory of\nDoris\u201d.\nThis magical climax, combined\nwith the backstory of Derren\u2019s\ngrandfather, causes a flood of\nemotions to rush through Emma.\nThe fond memories of her own\ngrandmother are mixed with the\nsurprise of the impossible coin, to\ncreate a truly unique experience\nthat can\u2019t be had elsewhere in the\nentertainment world.\nNot bad right? Different from\nthe awful, tuxedo-wearing, wand-bearing stereotypes you\u2019ll find if you\nsearch \u2018magician\u2019 on google images.\nBut an interesting fact about every\nmagician, even the good ones, is\nthat we all go through the exact\nsame journey.\nThe reason someone starts learning\nmagic is almost always a lack of\nself-esteem. Why else would you\nwant to learn a skill that basically\nsays \u201cplease look at me, aren\u2019t I\namazing\u201d? Learning sleight of hand\nrequires a good amount of practice,\nand only those who don\u2019t have the\nchance to do more fun things, like\ngoing to parties or having friends,\nhave the time to spend their teenage\nlives practising in front of a mirror.\nAnd then, even after you\u2019ve spent\nfar too much time learning your\nnew abilities when you could have\nbeen developing genuine social\nskills, then you\u2019ve got to be \u2018that\nguy\u2019 for at least two years. The guy\nwho carries four decks of cards and\nsix pieces of rope everywhere; who\ncrowbars a magic trick into every\nsocial interaction; who wears mostly\nblack and maybe even,God forbid,a\nplaying card tie. Welcome to magic\npuberty.\nAt this point most of your friends\nhave probably disowned you, but\nif you\u2019ve made it this far then\nyou\u2019ll now have the experience to\nperform tricks that won\u2019t cause your\nspectators to roll their eyes, and\nperhaps even provoke a genuine\nsmile in the right people.\nIf this all sounds good to you, god\nknows why it would, then maybe\nyou have what it takes to become a\nmagician yourself. If you stick with\nit long enough, then who knows,\nmaybe you\u2019ll become so remarkable\nthat you\u2019ll change what people\nthink of when they hear the word\nmagician, to you.\nI\u2019m looking to start a magic\nsociety, so if you\u2019re already\ninto magic, or if you\u2019re keen to\nlearn, then drop me an email\nat jxz12@ic.ac.uk with a link to\nyour Facebook, and I\u2019ll add you\nto a group where I\u2019m gathering\nanybody who would consider\njoining.\nMagicians are sexy now.

George\nOsborne, everybody\u2019s\nfavourite tax-credit-for-the-disabled-cutting, pro-taxing-tampons chancellor of the exchequer\nwas back at Imperial. Hoorah!\nHe was here to promote the latest\nspending review. After spouting\nsome shpiel about the NHS and that\nwe need to hire more spies because,\nlike, the internet exists, George-O\nwent on to say that Imperial \u201cdoesn\u2019t\njust represent the future of science\nin the world, it represents the future\nof the economy here in the UK\u201d.\nFirst of all, congrats to us. We all\nattend the university that represents\n\u2018future science in the world\u2019, a\nsoundbite so muddled it could be a\ndodgy pitch on The Apprentice.\nAs much as it pains me to say,\nImperial could end up looking a\nlittle like the economy quite soon.\nThis week we\u2019ve seen the release\nof a new green paper on higher\neducation, setting out what will\nprobably become law within this\nparliament. If everything in the\npaper does happen, which is pretty\nlikely, we\u2019d see the top universities,\ndoing STEM subjects (two ticks\nfor us, then) being allowed to\nsignificantly bump up fees.\nA word from the Editor\nEditor-in-Chief\nGrace Rahman\nNews Editor\nCecily Johnson\nComment Editors\nTessa Davey and Vivien Hadlow\nScience Editors\nJane Courtnell and Lef\nApostolakis\nArts Editors\nIndira Malik, Jingjie Cheng and\nMax Falkenberg\nMusic Editor\nCale Tilford\nFilm Editor\nFred Fyles\nWelfare Editor\nNoor Mulheron\nSports Editor\nJosh O\u2019Donnell\nPuzzles Editors\nHamish Beck and Roxana Radu\nCopy Editors\nMattin Mir-Tahmasebi, Henry\nLloyd Bates, Anthony Long,\nAlexandra Lim, Francesca\nSiracusa and James Bates\nCover Pictures\nby Imperial College London and\nCale Tilford\nNews\nComment\nFeatures\nScience\nGames\nMusic\nFilm\nArts\nMusic\nClubs & Societies\nPuzzles\nHangman\nSports\n3\n5\n9\n10\n13\n14\n18\n22\n29\n27\n29\n30\n32\nThe paper\u2019s already been damned\nby unions, academics and students\nacross the country for treating\nstudents as consumers.\nThe biggest threat here is\nattaching a commercial price\nto quality of teaching. Only the\nwealthiest can afford the best\neducation, or aren\u2019t frightened off\nby the doom of huge loans. Do\nwe want the best universities to be\neven more socially exclusive? The\ngovernment\u2019s only just realised that\nethnic names on UCAS forms are\nsubject to unconscious negative\nbias during the selection process,\nand now they\u2019re trying to make it\nharder for the poorest to get the best\neducation.\nWe\u2019ve got a pretty rage-y\ncomment piece about ghettoisation\nof halls this week, but it\u2019s much\nthe same story as this one. If you\ncharge for the good stuff, all the\nrich people will end up in one place,\nand the poor in another. This is an\nestablished model for business, but\nshould publicly funded universities\nbe adopting it too?\nIt all comes down to the question\nof whether students should\nbe treated as consumers: their\nemployability like the interest rate,\nUCAS points your credit score and\nan education the big old payday loan\nyou\u2019re getting.\nPlease write in if you go to the\nbusiness school and that metaphor\nis so factually incorrect, it upset\nyou. Write in if you liked it, because\nit\u2019s mid-term, and everybody likes\ncompliments.\nIf anything here riles you, makes\nyou angry, or better, makes you\nwant to put pen to paper or stylus\nto tablet, let me know, and we\u2019ll\nprobably flipping publish you. It\u2019s\nlike having a blog, except people\nbesides your mates might read it.

This new body\nwould also be in charge of\nranking institutions based on\nstudent satisfaction, teaching,\nand something the green paper\nputs particular emphasis on:\nemployability.\nA \u2018green paper\u2019 is the\ngovernment\u2019s way of reviewing\nlegislation before it becomes law.\nAt the moment, the Department\nforBusiness,InnovationandSkills,\nthat manages higher education,\nis asking for feedback on the\npaper. Professors from Warwick,\nNewcastle and UCL, amongst\nothers, have signed an open\nletter, published in the Guardian,\ncondemning the proposals. The\ngroup of professors are worried\nthat this legislation would allow\n\u201cmarket forces [to] permeate\u201d\nthe sector. They also dispute the\nrelaxation of rules for private\nsector companies becoming\nuniversities. Comparing the new\nstrategy to the model that \u201ccaused\nthe financial crash\u201d, they also\nreport dismay at the green paper\u2019s\nemphasis on what employers\nwant, rather than the opinions\nof those working within higher\neducation institutions. Indeed, the\nNUS reports that \u2018what employers\nwant\u2019 is mentioned in the paper\n35 times, as opposed to \u2018what\nstudents want\u2019, which is brought\nup 23 times.\nThe National Union of Students,\nwho are affiliated with student\nunions across the country, but\nnot Imperial\u2019s, say the paper is\nunfortunate in that it only focuses\non \u201centry and exit to the system\u201d.\nThe NUS closed a press release\non the paper saying, \u201cthis is the\nuniversity hunger games and the\nones losing out are students and\nacademics.\u201d\nThe paper touches on the future\nof student unions, saying they will\nbe subject to trade union reforms\nthat will \u201cimprove union practices\nand increasy transparency\u201d. The\nopen letter in the Guardian\nexpressed fear that these changes\nwill risk unions\u2019\u201cautonomy\u201d.\nJennie Watson, Imperial union\u2019s\n\u2018What\nemployers\nwant\u2019 is\nmentioned\n35 times\nGovernment unveils university funding changes\nDeputy President (Welfare), said,\n\u201cEven at this early stage I am\nextremely concerned about the\nimpact the proposals will have on\nstudents, fees and the future of\nhigher education.\u201d\nAnImperialcollegespokesperson\nsaid, \u201cThe College is considering\nthe Green Paper carefully and\nwill respond to the consultation,\u201d\nadding that, \u201cthe independence\n\u2022 Universities would be allowed\nto raise fees with inflation\n\u2022 Easier for institutions to get\nuniversity status\n\u2022 Plans have been called \u201cTrojan\nhorse for raising fees\u201d\nof universities should be fully\nrecognised by the Government as\nit develops these proposals, and\ndecisions on the future allocation\nof funding to universities should\nremain independent of Ministers\nand Government departments.\nWe look forward to discussing the\nkey issues with Imperial College\nUnion, and to sharing our draft\nresponse with them.\u201d\n\n"

Like his\nprevious work, they are full of\nalien sounds, but this time they\u2019re\ncombined to form something that\nfeels a lot more whole.\nFrom the grungy depths of \u2018Sdfk\u2019\nto the anthemic heights of \u2018I Bit\nThrough It,\u2019Garden of Delete takes us\non a journey through an otherwordly\nlandscape that few musicians are\ncapable of constructing.\nI\u2019ve spent the last week almost\nexclusively listened to the record;\neach listen allows me, for short\nmoment, to escape the reality of\neveryday life. It has guided me\nthrough the streets at night as I walk\nthrough dark, isolated pathways and\nit has kept me awake on late, lonely\nbus rides home. It is far more than\na companion. From the beeping\nof closing tube doors to midnight\nconversations in McDonalds, the\nSomeone has discovered how to use Microsoft Paint.

Photo Credit: Warp\nalbum perfectly blends in with\nthe sounds of travel and the bustle\nof the inner city. It is cinematic\non a personal level, making every\nmoment feel like the prelude to an\nominous threat.\nWhile it is by far Lopatin\u2019s most\nwelcoming collection of songs,\nthere is still a lot of experimentation\nacross the twelve tracks that make\nup the record. While it may not\nhave been his intention, the themes\nof deletion and negative space are\nessential to much of the appeal of\nGarden of Delete.\nAt the beginning of \u2018Ezra\u2019 it\nsounds like the artist has selected\nparts of the track and pressed delete\non a keyboard;it is in these moments\nof silence that he evokes far more\nemotion than many artists can in\nthree entire minutes. Time stops\nand then starts back up again, like a\nnightmarish, glitched rollercoaster.\nThere is much about Garden of\nDelete to fear; the gargles, asthmatic\nwhimpers, and high-pitched\nsqueams of its vocal samples quickly\nbecome rival voices in your head.\nSometimes you can hear words\namong these warped growls, and\namusingly, Lopatin has released a\nset of lyric sheets for the album.\nAs always, Lopatin creates an\nelectric range of synthesiser sounds.\nThere are the usual hard-hitting\ncrashes and some are grainy and\nuncomfortable to listen to. These\nare matched by the dulcet tones of\nstrings, which at times sound like\nweird imitations of Arca.There\u2019s one Lopatin uses the iTunes visualiser to advertise his new music. Photo Credit: Warp\nsynth on the album shimmering; if\nwe could hear the sun shining, this\nis would what it would sound like.\n\u2018Mutant Standard\u2019, an eight\nminute epic, stands out as the most\ncinematic piece on the record. It\nstarts off like a thumping, violent\nheartbeat and evolves into a richly\nlayered anthem.\nTo fully appreciate Oneohtrix\nPoint Never\u2019s latest work, listen to it\nin the darkest corner of the darkest\nalleyway in the worst part of town.\nLose all illusion of safety and allow\nit to guide you through through the\nnight. By the time you arrive at your\ndestination, the music is over, but\nyour mind and body are ready.\nGarden of Delete by Oneohtrix Point\nNever is out now on Warp\nA journey\nthrough\nan\notherwordly\nlandscape\nListen to it in\nthe darkest\ncorner of\nthe darkest\nalleyway in\nthe worst\npart of town\nGrimes\u2019 radiant Art Angels\nW\nith Visions, Grimes\n(the stage name of\nClaire Boucher)\ngave us an album\nthat combined the danceable sound\nof synthpop with introspection\nand the sorrow of dark-wave.\nAs one of the defining albums\nof 2012, it was celebrated and\nadored by many, including myself.\nUpon first hearing \u2018REALiTi\u2019(the\noriginal version), I felt confident\nthat Boucher would deliver another\nsonically impressive album, distinct\nand radical when compared to her\ncontemporaries. This feeling soon\nbegan to fade with the release of her\nnew singles, \u2018Flesh without Blood\u2019\nand \u2018Life in the Vivid Dream\u2019,\nthe first we would hear from the\nrecord. I was ready to let my own\nexpectations inhibit my ability to\nform a fair opinion of Art Angels,\nbut after seeing how they fit into\nher new work, it\u2019s obvious that\nGrimes hasn\u2019t completely left her\nold sound behind. Her music is now\nmore guitar-driven and borders\non bubblegum pop \u2013 somehow it\nworks. Art Angels is full of bangers\n(and I say that un-ironically).\nGrimes returns three-eyed and chirpy.

The drawn out \u201cCalifornia\u201d\nin the chorus turns the song into\none of the year\u2019s biggest anthems.\nGrimes crushes it on the unhinged\n\u2018Kill V. Maim\u2019, a song \u201cwritten from\nthe perspective of Al Pacino in\nThe Godfather Pt 2. Except he\u2019s a\nvampire who can switch gender and\ntravel through space.\u201d It\u2019s one of\nthe many songs from the album that\nforces your body to wiggle and jerk\nin ways Drake would be proud of.\nJanelle Monae\u2019s guest vocals on\n\u2018Venus Fly\u2019 turn it into strange\nfuturistic pop. It lures you in\nwith a trap-like beat and then\nsurprises you with a beautiful\nviolin solo. It\u2019s easily the most\nexperimental track on the album.\nLike an angel from heaven, Art\nAngels,glows with a radiance.It stays\nwithin the confines of pop music but\nis able to transcend the tired tropes\nof the pop industrial complex.\nWhile it might not be as coherent\nas previous albums, the songs stand\non their own. They are notably\ncatchy, uplifting, and accessible.\nArt Angels by Grimes is out now on\n4AD\nDon\u2019t listen to the harsh editor.

That is\nwhy I applaud Nikolai.\nPerformed in a secret location as\npart of their \u2018Staging a Revolution\u2019\nfestival, the evening simulated what\nit is like consuming art in a repressive\nregime. The crowd assembles at\nan undisclosed location before\nbeing taken in small groups to the\nperformance space. The audience\nare given blankets, soup and a drink\nand we all squeeze together on\nthese long benches. For \u2018Generation\nJeans\u2019 we\u2019re sitting in a Westminster\ncar park. It isn\u2019t exactly flattering,\nbut the whole process gives so\nmuch more weight to the political\nmessage behind BFT\u2019s production.\nThere is a genuine vibe to the event,\na vibe even the few hotspots left in\nLondon can\u2019t recreate. This isn\u2019t just\none man and his audience, but a\npowerful communal movement.\nbut much harder to do. Regardless,\nwhether we act or not, art might\nnot confront a regime directly, but\nit is a constant reminder of what\nwe are missing, and the issues we\u2019ve\nforgotten about.\nThe night I went to see the\nBelarus Free Theatre, we were\nin Westminster alongside the\n\u2018Million Masks\u2019 march. As we left\nthe car park, we walked past the\nlast remnants of the Met\u2019s kettle.\nLooking at the regimes abroad, it\nis so easy to feel safe at home, but\nseeing the Government\u2019s treatment\nof protesters and the unsettling\ntribal tactics of the police is just a\nreminder of how thin the line is.\nWe can sit back, passive, and let\nthe protest movements walk by, but\ndon\u2019t complain when in thirty years\nyou\u2019re not happy with the regime\nwe\u2019ve built.\nIt is protest\nart whose\nvoice shouts\nthe loudest\nand echoes\nthe longest\nThe first\ndrowned\nSyrian child\nsparks\noutrage, but\nthe next falls\non deaf ears\nthe media carries far greater weight\nwhen delivered through art.

For all the\nsunflower seeds Ai Weiwei could\npossibly carve, the actual difference\nto people\u2019s lives under a repressive\nregime feels insignificant. Despite\nthe protest anthems of Billy Bragg\nand co, the wars in the Middle East\nwent on. What does art actually\nachieve? Is awareness enough? It\nis because of this that we find it\nso easy to fall into the usual cycle\nof disillusionment whereby the\nfirst drowned Syrian child sparks\noutrage but the next falls on deaf\nears.Will we ever get more engaged,\nI hope so, but I say this with the\nfull knowledge that it\u2019s easy to talk\ncurrent. In their one-man show\n\u2018Generation Jeans\u2019, BFT\u2019s cofounder and political activist\nNikolai Khalezin tells his story of\njeans and rock music as a symbol of\nfreedom in Belarus.\nWhile the work in itself doesn\u2019t\nblow me away, the play has a far\ngreater symbolic importance.\nWhile the spirit of protest and\nresistance is embodied across a\nwhole spectrum of disciplines and\nactions, it is protest art whose voice\nshouts the loudest and echoes the\nlongest.

An\neccentric fellow in\nhis oriental attire, elongated fingers\nreach out to something behind\nthe curtain. His eyes wrinkled\nfrom laughter, mouth wide open,\nrevealing a missing tooth.This is my\nfirst impression of him.As I glanced\nat those 18th\ncentury aristocratic\nelites arrayed on the walls of Royal\nAcademy, Liotard\u2019s self-portrait,\nlaughing, still managed to impress.\nBorn in Geneva and trained in\nParis, Liotard was one of the most\naccomplished portraitists of the\nEnlightenment era. He earned a\nreputation for his meticulous pastel\nportraits, and was commissioned in\nroyal courts across Europe. Styled\nhimself in an exotic manner,Liotard\n\u2018the Turk\u2019 fuelled the fashion for\nturquerie, or Orientalism, that\nindulged the European society. Yet\nnowadays his name only evokes\nunfamiliarity.\n\u201cTruth prevailed in all Liotard\u2019s\nworks,\u201d marked an art historian.\nIndeed, gazing down at me with\nher imposing look, the Countess of\nGuildford is a perfect illustration of\nverisimilitude.She is garnished with\ngleaming velvet and lace, diamond\non her neck sparkles from a distance.\nBut is she flattered by the ruthless\ndepiction of her double chin? I don\u2019t\nknow; I am amused.\nThere is candour in Liotard\u2019s\nseemingly extravagant paintings,\nbut it did not set him apart from\nRembrandt or Durer.In my opinion,\nLiotard\u2019s speciality lied elsewhere \u2013\nhe caught fleeting moments with\ntender, sympathetic eyes. After\nbeing snared onto vellum for two-and-a-half centuries, his sitters\nare still alive with pastel warmth.\nAmong them all, the portrait of\nSuzanne Curchod is my favourite.\nSeated by a lavishing array of fruit\nand glassware, she looks up as if\ninterrupted in her reading, eyes\nflickering with delight. And what\na dress she is wearing! Opaque,\nradiant blue heightened with\ngouache; intricate, transparent silk\nembroidered on her sleeves.\nIn the next room, hanging next to\neach other are the double portraits of\nJulie and Issac-Louis de Thellusson.\nThe newly-weds stare admiringly\ninto each other, faces illuminating\nwith joy. Beside them, the frail\npainting of Princess Louisa-Anne\ngazes at me with anxious, curious\neyes \u2013 a little girl dwarfed by an\noversized dress. Liotard painted\nher hair so soft that it begs to be\ncombed.Very few artists can capture\nsuch heartbreaking tenderness, and\nhe succeeded with a humane touch\nrarely found in royal portraitures.\nHis characters are not social ciphers;\nJean Etienne Liotard, Portrait of Mrs Jacquet (pastel). Photo Credit: artfund.org\nLiotard\ncatches\nfleeting\nmoments\nwith\nsympathetic\neyes\nthey are ordinary, likeable people we\nmeet everyday.\nWhy have such works disappeared\nfrom public attention? This is a\nquestion easy to ask, but tricky\nto answer. Unlike the man\nhimself, Liotard\u2019s works do not\nmake a proclamation. They were\ncommissioned as private collections,\ntreasured by their owners without\nmaking a public appearance. His\nchoice of medium, the versatile\npastel, gave these paintings vivacity\nand luminosity, but also made\nthem extremely fragile and almost\nimpossible to transport.\nMoreover, art is often evaluated\naccording to contemporary taste.\nIn a world filled with abstract and\ncontroversial art, Liotard\u2019s calm\ncontentment may be too subtle\nto be fully appreciated. Yet there\u2019s\ncharm in every portrait \u2013 they will\nput up a smile on your face.\n250 years\nlater, his\nsitters are\nstill alive\nwith pastel\nwarmth\nA\nll the world\u2019s a stage. If\nonly it was one decked\nout by the NT\u2019s set\ndesigners for their\nproduction of \u2018As You Like It\u2019.\nDirected by Polly Findlay, this\nlatest performance of Shakespearian\ncomedy gives us a handful of gags,\nawe-inspiring stagecraft and a\nsoundscape that eclipses both \u2013\nbut all at the expense of examining\nRosalind and our own gender\nzeitgeist.\nWe walk in to a colour-charged\ntrading floor and an already bustling\ncast throwing up some definite Star\nTrek vibes.Rosalie Craig as Rosalind\nsurveys her uniformed office drones,\nfor a second suggesting that she may\nlive up to the role as Shakespeare\u2019s\nmost-developed female lead (albeit\none that spends half of the play\ndressed as a man). This space(ship)\nthen ascends in one of my favourite\nStyle over substance in As You Like It\nJenny Lea\nWriter\nThe National Theatre throws the heft of its big budget behind Shakespeare\u2019s classic\nis it an unwritten rule that in all\nShakespeare they must attempt as\nmany regional dialects as possible?!\nIn many past performances and\nnow. we see a Scot, a Welshman and\na hybrid of the two, just to make\nthe 16th\nCentury verse a little more\ndifficult. This was all accompanied\nby Touchstone\u2019s adoption of a\nsomewhat Geordie accent. I wonder\nif Old William was thinking of his\nlikeness to a particular Hairy Biker\nwhen writing the play\u2026\nWhen you find a free computer in labs but someone\u2019s locked it. Photo Credit: Johan Persson\nThere must be a word for the\nscore; a choir nestled in furniture\nwilderness provide backing for Fra\nFre\u2019s magnificent earthy vocals (and\njawline). As well as the occasional\nowl noise and rain shower, to revert\nonce more to my theme of being\nmore enamoured by the actors\u2019\nset than their speeches, the close\nharmonies were exquisitely judged\nand at times could have formed a\npiece in itself.\nOne thing that I have noticed:\nAwe-inspiring\nstagecraft\nat the\nexpense of\nRosalind\nOverall however, a pleasurable\nproduction. A slapstick and self-aware nature avoids the cringe factor\nthat is all too often served with the\nmodernization of a classic tale, but\nin turn simply not enough was done\nfor the audience to leave the theatre\nwith \u201cBut heavenly Rosalind!\u201d\nresonating in their minds.\nUntil March 5th\nat the National\nTheatre\u2019s Olivier Stage\nTickets from \u00a315\nA slapstick\nand self-aware nature\navoids the\ncringe factor\nset transitions of all time, as bonsai\ntrees fall to the floor and darkness\ntransports us into a forest of\ndangling desks.\nUnfortunately, the magical\nmysteryofthesurroundingsdoesnot\nbleed into the dynamics of the two\nmain characters. Rosalind is quickly\nreduced to giddiness by Orlando\u2019s\nlove, whilst he rarely hints at her\ncross-dressing and continues to woo\nvia the age-old correspondence of\npost-it notes. A seemingly bizarre\noccurrence considering the text\u2019s\nreliance on homosexuality being\ninherently \u2018funny\u2019 for comedy.\nKieran Hodgson doping his way to the top\nI\nn 2003 a young, frail lad from\nWest Yorkshire had only\none idol \u2013 the great Lance\nArmstrong. Inspired by the\nserene, omnipotent cyclist come\nlying bastard, Kieran Hodgson is\ntaking the world by storm with his\ncompletely honest, unadulterated,\ndope-free journey. Fun and easy-going, Hodgson\u2019s set is smooth\nand simple, effortlessly offering\nhis joyous accounts of cycling\u2019s\nfavourite bad guy.\nThe talk of the town since\nhis lauded performance at the\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nEdinburgh Fringe, Hodgson is\nthe latest young comedian on the\nroad to hitting it big. His brand of\ncomedy isn\u2019t wildly smart and his\nimpressions aren\u2019t hugely refined,\nbut he offers a laid back,engaging set\nwhich is wonderfully easy watching.\nOddly for a northerner, he sounds\nas southern as you can get, but\nthat doesn\u2019t hold back the endless\nquips on his homeland. Throwing\nin musical numbers and a cracking\ncameo from Opera, Hodgson has\nan eye for picking out the audience\u2019s\nmemorable Armstrong moments\nand he plays on it with ease, but not\neveryone is quite so tuned in.\nIt is funny how a figure like\nArmstrong has such a comic\nappeal \u2013 the jokes seem endless\nand continually hilarious. The\naspirations of a young mountain\nbiker and his uninspired stray into\nNot quite Armstrong\u2019s physique but almost...\nthe world of rowing only leads\nback to a greater, more wonderful\nreminder of Armstrong\u2019s honest\nways. A moral tale Hodgson\u2019s\nevening is not, but through all the\nsatire it\u2019s not too hard finding one.\nYet, to use a term I never thought\nI would, Hodgson is missing his\nX-factor.\nAlthough I had great fun, I get\nthe feeling that Hodgson\u2019s show just\nwon\u2019t satisfy our generation.Despite\nhaving grown up with an awareness\nof Armstrong, his story and his\nactions seem to mean more to\npeople in their late twenties than to\nus.A rubbish reason,I know,but the\nresult is that for me Hodgson never\nhits the heights I was promised.\n\n"

Who do they trust when\nthere is a conflict of evidence? How\napplicable is this knowledge?\nTo ensure politicians can\nunderstand the fields of science\nrelevant to their work, policy\nbriefings are written. The most\nwell know of these are POST\nNotes, which, as the name suggests,\nare written by the Parliamentary\nAndre Arroja Neves, winner of New\nHorizons in mathematics.

Whilst\nthese are supposedly neutral in\ncontent, as they are produced by the\ngovernment, other briefings can be\nmuch more targeted.\nScience-focused think tanks\nand lobby groups also summarise\nevidence from the literature,but they\nuse it to make suggestions for future\npolicy choices. The papers produced\nby these institutes are presented\nto policy makers, and become part\nof the body of knowledge they\nuse to make decisions. One such\nthinktank is based here at Imperial\n\u2013 the student-run London Forum\nfor Science and Policy, which\nanyone can get involved with. They\nhave already published a number\nof papers, and even presented at\nBrussels.\nInterested in getting involved\nwith a thinktank, or want to learn\nmore? Come along to the launch\nof LFSP\u2019s most recent paper,\nImproving the Visibility of Women\nin STEM, at 6.30pm today in the\nPippard Lecture Theatre, or like\nLFSP on Facebook. We are looking\nfor enthusiastic people to get\ninvolved in writing policy papers,\nso if you are interested in what you\nhave just read, get in touch!\nC\nancer is one of the\nscourges of humanity.\nTwo trillion cell\ndivisions take place in\nthe average human body every\nday. Every time a cell divides,\nroughly three billion genetic base\npairs distributed throughout 23\nchromosomes need to be copied,\nand sometimes our bodies get it\nwrong.Usually,these poor copies are\nautomatically destroyed by the body,\nbut from time to time, a mutated\ncell slips through and continues to\ndivide. If this goes unchecked, a\nbenign tumour may form. If that\ntumour begins to spread to other\ntissues, it is known as malignant,\nand this is cancer.\nWhile scientists have developed\ntreatments for various cancers,\nmortality rates still remain high, at\naround one in five. Because cancer\nis caused by abnormal cell division,\nthe more cells a person has, the\nmore likely they are to get cancer.\nTaller people, for example, are at\nhigher risk than shorter people.\nSo what about huge animals,\nlike whales? Animals get cancer in\nmuch the same way humans do, and\nSamuel Lickiss\nWriter\nConservation in aid of cancer research\nCutting corners in conservation may cost us the cure\nwhales are no exception. However,\ncancer in whales very rarely spreads.\nAt the other end of the spectrum,\ntiny animals with short life spans,\nlike mice, are cancer prone.\nThis lack of correlation is called\nPeto\u2019s paradox. Larger animals\nseem to have evolved mechanisms\nfor effectively combating cancer;\nessential to ensuring their survival.\nConsequently, whales may hold\na key to learning how to beat\ncancer. Researchers are looking at\nthis seriously. But, as many aspects\nof nature, one unlikely animal so\nspectacularly violates Peto\u2019s paradox\nthat a cure for cancer may be held in\nits genetics.\nThe naked mole rat is sufficiently\nugly to be featured in The Ugly\nAnimals: We can\u2019t all be Pandas by\nSimon Watt, published by the\nUgly Animal Preservation Society.\nBut the naked mole rat is far more\nthan meets the eye. One mole rat\ncan live for up to 30 years without\never getting cancer. A 2013 study\nin Nature found that naked mole\nrats produce a gloopy, sugar-rich\nsubstance called hyaluronan. This\nforms a kind of seal around cells,\npreventing the runaway cell division\nthat causes cancer. The same\nchemical is produced by humans,\nbut not in high quantities, and the\nnaked mole rat\u2019s version is also a\nlonger chained form.\nHyaluronan is already used as a\ncancer treatment. Researchers are\nnow looking to use the naked mole\nrat\u2019s version to find out if it is more\neffective. They may find that it is\nineffective: that it fails to have the\nsame effect in humans as it does in\nthe naked mole rat. Many clinical\ntests that are effective in animal\ntest subjects fail to have any effect\nin humans, due to differences in our\ngenetics. However, there\u2019s a chance\nthat it could substantially improve\nsurvival rates of cancer in humans,\nespecially when combined with\nother, more widespread treatments.\nUnfortunately for species like\nthe mole rat, some scientists have\nposited that the earth is on the brink\nof a sixth mass extinction event.\nClimate change, loss of habitat, and\nvarious other factors have made\nconservation ever more challenging\nand ever-more crucial. This week,\nUN officials have announced that\nplans to tackle climate change\nare not enough to keep the global\ntemperature increase below the 2o\nC\ndanger threshold. Later this month,\nUN nations will meet in Paris to\ndiscuss plans to tackle climate\nchange.\nThe effects of climate change\nand habitat loss are showing\nalready in the UK. Four UK bird\nspecies, including the puffin, are\nnow at serious risk of extinction.\nEight British species are on\nthe International Union for the\nConservation of Nature\u2019s Red List\nof threatened species, and a further\n14 species considered to be \u2018nearthreatened\u2019.\nWhy does this matter?\nFor Simon Watt at the Ugly\nAnimal Preservation Society, the\n\u2018pretty\u2019 animals like pandas get all\nthe attention, and all the money.\nH\now many species do\nyou think exist on\nplanet earth? 100\nthousand, one million,\nten million? Recent estimations\nhave induced a species count of\n8.7 million. More than 1000 years\nwould be needed to catalogue such\na vast number. It\u2019s really a question\nof \u2018where do we start?\u2019\nFrom the depths of the icy\nAntarctic waters, this answer is\nliterally being called out to us.\nRecently tuning in to \u2018What\u2019s going\non in the Antarctic\u2019, astonishment\ncirculated with the identification\nof a unique whale song and with it,\nperhaps a new species. But how can\nwe not have already catalogued all\nwhale species? Let\u2019s face it; they\u2019re\nnot exactly small!\nThe mysterious Antarctic habitant\nis thought to be from the family\nZiphiidea, otherwise known as\n\u2018Deraniyagala\u2019s Beaked Whales\u2019.\nThey are renowned for their shyness\nand thus a poorly-known animal\ngroup. Deraniyagala\u2019s beaked whale\nwas identified as a new species only\nlast year, bringing the total number\nof species in the beaked whale\ngroup to 22. Diving out of the sight\nof any on-looking scientists, it is\nsuspected that the Ziphiidea family\nharbours more unknown relations\nto Deraniyagala.\nWe bias our conservation towards\npandas, tigers and elephants, while\nthe naked mole rat, blobfish and\nassorted other ugly animals are\nneglected.\nSome of these animals, like\nthe naked mole rat, could hold\nimportantsecrets.Bylettingthemgo\nextinct, we could be losing valuable,\nirrecoverable information. While\nthe naked mole rat\u2019s population is\nhealthy, it\u2019s clear that we need to\nwork to be indiscriminate in our\nefforts to conserve life on earth.One\nday, we may find ourselves indebted\nto the naked mole rat.\nJane Courtnell\nScience Editor\nLonely wail might indicate new species\nYet, echolocation of this new\nspecies is difficult. The unique\nsignal, named BW29, has been\nrecorded fourteen times on separate\noccasions. Tracking down the\nanonymous composer is proving to\nbe problematic. Timing and sound\ntypes separate the signal from others\nknown. Suspicions lie with the\nstrap-toothed southern bottlenose\nspecies, however, sightings of this\nspecies are rare south of latitudes\n60o\nS in the Southern Ocean, giving\nthe strap-tooth a strong alibi.\nAnother suspect is the Gray\u2019s\nbeaked whale, commonly sighted\nin the region. However, frequency\nof the latter species\u2019 calls differs\nfrom the BW29 signal frequency,\nremoving the Gray beaked\nspecies as a culprit. Adding to the\nconfusion, another unique call,\ndubbed Antarctic BW37 has also\nbeen recorded, a higher frequency\nthan the first, but these two unique\ncalls could actually belong to the\nsame species. However, given the\nocean covers 70% of our planet, it\nwould be surprising if these signals\ndidn\u2019t belong to two new species.\nScientific community torn over a unique recording from elusive whale\nBehold the glorious mole rat.

The Party seeks power; not\nto improve the lives of others,\nbut entirely for its own interests.\nFrom the transceiving television\nsets used to monitor the citizens\u2019\nthoughtcrime (the act of socially\nunacceptable thoughts), there are\nmany areas where Orwell\u2019s fiction\nnow overlaps with the reality of 21st\ncentury Britain.\nWith the introduction of the\nInvestigatory Powers Bill, Theresa\nMay aspires to become much more\nthan Big Brother, and as a result our\nfuture has the potential to be far\nworse than Orwell\u2019s dystopian novel\never predicted.\nThe extent to which we have\nsubmitted ourselves to the internet\nhas left us exposed. If this bill\nsucceeds, security forces will be\ngiven new powers to examine our\ndigital footprint from the last twelve\nmonths. It will enshrine in law the\nbulk collection of personal metadata,\nthe hacking into and bugging of\ncomputers,and will force companies\nto assist in bypassing encryption.\nAny curiosity or \u201cextremist\u201d\nintrigue could be used against\nus without our knowledge and\na simple spelling mistake when\nentering a URL could now make\nyou look suspect. By only keeping\nyour history up to the first forward\nslash of each website address,\nsecurity forces lose the context of\nwhy someone is visiting a specific\nsite. It could be entirely innocent.\nThe people of Britain seem all\ntoo eager to sacrifice their right\nto privacy in order to protect\nthemselves from the supposed\nthreat of terrorism. Andrew Parker,\nthe chief of MI5, has been vocal in\nthe need for more powers to assist\nin fight against those who oppose\nour \u201cgreat\u201d nation, claiming that\nwe are now facing the most serious\nthreat of a terrorist attack since\n9/11. Mention ISIS and al-Qaeda\nenough times and you can make\nthe public believe anything. For the\nestablishment, fear has always been\ntheir most powerful tool.\nIt would be naive to believe that\nthese powers would be only used\nprobably get a warrant for the\nQueen\u2019s browsing history.\nPersonally, I think that the\nConservative Party is a serious\nthreat to our national security,\nour economic security and your\nfamily\u2019s security. I could probably\neven find evidence to support this,\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean I should be\nallowed unbounded access to their\npersonal data. While this argument\nmight be reductive, it illustrates that\nthreats are often entirely subjective,\nespecially to those trying to cling to\npower.\nAs well as the far right, it\u2019s often\nthe \u201cextreme\u201d left that are most\nvulnerable to surveillance.\nIn the nineties, police conducted\nspying operations on a number\nof Labour politicians. They\nexamined their political beliefs, the\ndemonstrations they attended, and\nthe people they met with.\nWhile the new bill places\nrestrictions on the surveillance of\nMPs (the Prime Minister must be\nconsulted in all cases),it could easily\nbe used to undermine activists and\nanyone the establishment disagrees\nwith. So, it\u2019s not ridiculous to think\nthat these powers could one day be\nused by a ruling party to quell the\nopposition.\nObviously,if you\u2019ve got nothing to\nhide, you\u2019ve got nothing to fear. It\u2019s\nonly metadata that the government\nis asking for, right?\nWe\u2019ve probably all looked at some\nkinky shit online that we\u2019d rather\nnot let other people know about. If\nyou\u2019re going to use that line, I look\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nYou should be more worried about Theresa May\u2019s new Investigatory Powers bill\nMention ISIS\nor al-Qaeda\nenough times\nand you can\nmake the\npublic believe\nanything\nforward to the moment when an\nentire year\u2019s worth of your browsing\nhistory is dumped on the internet;\nbecause all of the data that internet\ncompanies will be required keep on\nyou is unlikely to stay safe for long.\nYou only have to look back a few\nweeks to the TalkTalk hack and it\u2019s\nobvious that it probably won\u2019t just\nbe the government looking through\nall the porn sites you\u2019ve been on.\nThen there\u2019s the whole problem\nof encryption which makes the\nentire thing essentially useless\nagainst anyone actively hiding their\nactivities. If you\u2019re serious about\ncausing harm or committing an\nact of terror it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re\nencrypting your communication.\nMaking encryption illegal will do\nnothing to stop that.\nI wish there was something we\ncould do to stop this bill passing,\nbut in reality we\u2019re powerless. No\none voted for the Conservatives in\nthe hope they would pass a bill like\nthis (if you did, then you\u2019re an awful\nperson).\nYou have to start questioning\nwhetherwereallyliveinademocracy\n(the answer is no). I just hope that\nsomeone leaks all of Theresa May\u2019s\nmetadata, then she might begin to\nunderstand the true nature of what\nshe is proposing.\nIndira\nMalik\nagainst those who wish us harm.\nOur government\u2019s definition of a\nthreat extends to anyone opposing\nBritish values: democracy, the rule\nof law,individual liberty,and mutual\nrespect and tolerance of those with\ndifferent faiths and beliefs. It\u2019s a\ndefinition so loose that you could\nThe North South divide is part of being a Brit\nWhy can\u2019t we stop making fun of each other\u2019s accents and get along?\nJennifer Eden\nWriter\nW\nhere I come\nfrom, in rainy\nold Manchester,\nI\u2019m considered\nrelatively posh. Hop across the\nimaginary divide though, and I\nmight as well have just come up\nfrom the mines with a pie in one\nhand and a ferret in the other.\nVisits to see the family in Sussex\nare always a reminder of this, as\nmany a time my mild \u201cNorthern\naccent\u201d has been pointed out, badly\nimpersonated and then ripped to\nshreds. A Northerner, that\u2019s what\nI am. And people who live in the\nSouth are Southerners.Two separate\npeoples, within the same country.\nGoogle the North-South divide\nand it gives you a spiel about\ncultural and economic differences.\nEconomics helps to explain some of\nthe origins of the divide; the South\nbeing where the money flowed\nand the North being left with the\nequivalent of the Bountys in a box\nof celebrations. But there\u2019s more to\nit than that.\nDebates can go on for hours over\nwhose way is better and why. You\u2019ve\nheard it all before, but essentially\nthe bread and butter of the debate\nis that southerners are snobs, and\nnortherners are rough. Southerners\nshoot pheasants, northerners shoot\nrats in the kitchen. Southerners\ndrink Chai lattes (no fat, no foam,\nno point), northerners drink tea.\nSoutherners actually see the sun,\nnortherners don\u2019t. But why do we\nso often feel the need to point out\nthese differences? Can\u2019t we all just\nget along?\nThe simple answer is no, not\nfor now. For guidance, look at\nsomething like the Tribal Instinct\nHypothesis, where it\u2019s stated that\nas a tribal species we are capable\nof extreme compassion towards\nmembers of our own groups, and\nhostility towards others. A bit like\ntwo separate ant colonies (also a\ntribal species), North and South\nare rival tribes. Thankfully there\u2019s\nno physical rivalry (i.e. punch ups\noutside a chippy in Birmingham),\nit\u2019s just a subtle, underlying\ncompetitiveness.\nAnd of course there\u2019s the element\nof wanting to stick to what we know.\nSuch high\nrents will\ncreate\n\u2018ghettos\u2019 in\nhalls\nFor example, I know that I want my\ntea in a mug, not a pissing teapot\nand china.\nHowever, although small cultural\ndifferences will probably always\nremain, the economic balance\ndoes seem to be improving. With\nGeorge Osborne\u2019s plans for the\nNorthern Powerhouse, the North\nis proposed to have as large a role\nin the economy as London and the\nSouth East.\nNot only will this impact the\nNorth for the better, it will make\nBritain stronger as a whole country.\nOnce united and free of the\neconomic divide, we can start to\nembrace the quirks of where we\ncame from with much less of the\nsimmering resentment.\nDespite this, Northerners and\nSoutherners will always feel\nthe need to comment on one\nanother\u2019s pronunciation, eating\nhabits, drinking habits and general\nexistence. It\u2019s part of what being\na Brit is all about. If we were all\nexactly the same life would be a\nlittle dull, and that\u2019s something\nneither side wants to be.\nImperial\u2019s halls solution is a travesty\nThe accomodation rent hikes are extortion, plain and simple\nPhilip Kurukgy\nUnion Council Member\nF\nor the past five years,\nwhen it comes to handling\naccommodation issues,\nImperialhasbeenfollowing\nthe mantra that two wrongs make\na right and fixing problems by\ncreating new ones. Last year prices\nwere hiked in the South Kensington\nhalls by 10% to compensate for\nthe low rents in Woodward, since\nFreshers need to pay for a zone\n3 travel card. In what seemed a\nvictory last year, the Union Council\nwas allowed to set the rents, but the\nCollege had a fixed bottom line, so\nrents had to be hiked somewhere\nelse. The logic behind the increase\nin fees in Beit and Prince\u2019s Gardens,\nwas that if a fresher wants to live\nclose to campus, let them pay a\npremium for it.\nThe issue was raised in the last\ncouncil meeting and as a member,\nI am putting a motion forward for\nthe union to start lobbying college\nto change rents. Such high rents\nwill create \u2018ghettos\u2019 in halls, since\nonly people from the same class and\nsame background will be able to\nafford the rent. This endangers the\nvery essence and purpose of living\nout, which is learning to live in a\ndiverse environment.\nAs a hall senior this year, I can tell\nyou that current prices are seriously\naffecting students\u2019 ability to go out,\ndrink, and party. In certain cases\nsome of them had to rely on the\n\u00a32000 emergency fund the college\nhas in place for students in difficulty.\nAt a starting price of \u00a3224 a week,\nthat\u2019s the equivalent of \u00a38500 a year\nwhich a maintenance loan cannot\nfully cover. With further cuts in\nmaintenance grants next year, there\nis a genuine concern that people\nfrom poorer backgrounds will never\nbe able to afford to live in a South\nKensington hall. Why are students\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds\nbeing pushed out of central London\nby the college and given an 80\nminute daily commute? Why does\nliving in a hall close to campus\nneed to be considered a \u201cluxury\u201d\nthat justifies a premium, which has\nrecently turned to extortion with a\nhike every year?\nFundamentally, why are students\u2019\nopinions being disregarded?\nFrankly the answer is that we\nwere passive, we didn\u2019t protest\nagainst mistakes that were made\nby college. We just read about it in\nFELIX when the halls closed and\nwhen the new ones opened, we\njoked that we wouldn\u2019t want to be\na fresher this year. The union came\nup short in mobilising students and\nraising awareness amongst them\nconcerning these issues. And then\ncomes mismanagement and flawed\nlogic from the College.\nI find it surprising that a university\nthat\u2019s been performing so well\nacademically is so badly managed\nwhen it comes to student affairs.\nPeople will desire an Imperial\neducation no matter what, but the\ncollege has to learn not to take this\nfor granted.\nThere\u2019s no need to argue over hot beverages.

From the\nrecent uproar regarding VAT on\nsanitary products, to men, mental\nhealth and suicide, you must have\nbeen living in a pineapple under\nthe sea to be oblivious to the media\nfrenzy surrounding gender equality\nlately.\nI\u2019ve had countless conversations\nwith my friends about feminism,\nand I\u2019ve been struck by some\nserious misunderstandings of what\nfeminism is. And I want to clarify\nthis: it wasn\u2019t just my male friends\nwho seemed misinformed.\nI\u2019m fully aware that I\u2019m not an\nexpert on the issue, and I\u2019m far\nfrom what one would call an ideal\nadvocate for gender equality.Yet, it\u2019s\nan issue that, I believe, needs more\npublicity, more support, and most\nimportantly, clarification on what it\nstands for.\nFirst things first. I am a feminist,\nand I am proud to say so. This\nhowever, does not mean I host\nhead-shaving parties in my garden,\ncomplete with a burning bin in\nthe centre, which myself and other\nfeminists gallop around, flailing\nour bras like lassos, chanting\nman-hating Sanskrit mantras and\nengaging in voodoo on Ken dolls.\nSince when has being a feminist\nafraid of the connotations associated\nwith the title.\nPretty much every type of\nmovement that exists has some\nbarbaric fanatics,and feminism is no\nexception; man-haters are out there,\nand I acknowledge this. But these\nindividuals are a far cry from what\nfeminism represents.The movement\nrepresents a fight for equality, and\nlast time I checked, the notion of\nequality wasn\u2019t a radical one.\nFor the record, feminism is not\nsynonymous with man hating. It is\nnot about fighting for a matriarchy.\nIt is not a thinly veiled attack on\nmen, in order to undermine and\nsuppress them in society. Rather,\nit\u2019s a movement with re-thinking\ngender roles at the forefront of its\naims, for both men and women.\nRegarding women, the issues that\ndemonstrate that we need feminism\nare endless. I obviously will not\ntouch on everything, but a couple\nof issues really peeve me. As I\u2019ve\nmentioned, we\u2019re taxed for having\nsomething that closely resembles a\nmurder scene in our pants once a\nmonth. Apparently cleaning up a\nbleeding vag is a luxury these days.\nCombined this with the searing\nback and stomach cramps, my, aren\u2019t\nwe ruddy pampered!\nLet\u2019s not forget issues with\nour personalities too; my drive,\nmotivation and determination are\nactually \u201cbossy,\u201d and \u201cintimidating.\u201d\nHell, we can see this in action at\nImperial itself, which houses a load\nof successful female scientists and\nprofessors. I\u2019ve heard these women\ntalked about as \u201ccontrolling, shorttempered,\u201d and when they\u2019re a\ntad blunt with their orders, \u201cshe\nmust be on the blob.\u201d Their male\ncounterparts however, well, they\u2019re\ndriven, changing the game, and a\nrole model to look up to.\nWhat the hell is this all about?\nI, myself, am guilty in perceiving\nwomen like this, which is pretty\ndisgusting. There\u2019s no point in\nmotivating more young girls to get\ninto STEM subjects, if when they\nget there, their authority is belittled.\nI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to go\nabout changing this and I cannot\noffer any ground-breaking solutions.\nBut I guess recognition of our biases\nis a great way to start \u2013 next time\nyou deem a girl bossy,think whether\nyou\u2019d call a dude the same thing.\nBut why do we need to re-think\ngender roles for men? Men seem to\nhave it easier compared to women,\nright? They generally hold greater\npositions of power, earn more, and\naren\u2019t thought to be suppressed in\nsociety. Patriarchy is pretty neat for\nyou guys isn\u2019t it?\nFrom young boys shamed for\nbeing weak and expressing emotion,\nto grown men, expected to be the\nprovider and emotional rock for\ntheir families, patriarchy imposes\nridiculous pressures on men of all\nages to conform to its ludicrous\norder.\nI\u2019ve seen young men \u2013 my friends\n\u2013 suffering from mental illnesses,\nunable to express their emotions\n49, eclipsing cancer, road accidents\nand coronary heart disease. Yet,\nliterature shows that women suffer\nmore from depression. But it\u2019s\nnot un-womanly to seek help, and\nit\u2019s not un-womanly to cry. The\ninfatuation with being macho, the\nobsession with the stiff upper lip \u2013\nthese things evidently contribute to\nthe fragility of the mental state.\nMen are imprisoned by gender\nstereotypes too,and what constitutes\nmale success is in desperate need\nof reform. Men would clearly reap\nthe benefits of gender equality as\nwell, and it\u2019s now imperative that\nmen are invited to and become\nadvocates of feminism \u2013 not just to\nempower women, but to break free\nof the irrational gender stereotypes\nthemselves.\nThe Angry Grad\nColumnist\nEvery\nmovement\nthat exists\nhas barbaric\nfanatics\nEmma Watson persuaded Malala to be a feminist, but Angry Grad persuaded Watson. Photo Credit: Fox Searchlight\nIt wasn\u2019t just\nmy male\nfriends who\nseemed\nmisinformed\nalso meant that you\u2019re a radical?\nSome women would rather have\ndaily bikini waxes than associate\nthemselves with feminism, not\nbecause they are non-believers in\ngender equality, but rather they\u2019re\nand robbed of their right to be\nsensitive, in fear of being perceived\nas less manly, or God forbid, a girl.\nIn fact, suicide is the biggest killer\nof men between the ages of 20 and\n\n"

It\u2019s far from being\nthe be-all-and-end-all romantic drama, but it\u2019s by no\nmeans awful. However, it has always\nconfused me as to how that film has\nbecome the quintessential example\nof romantic cinema. It is, to a lot of\nburly men, \u2018that film she made me\nwatch one time\u2019. It may then please\nyou to know that there are much\nbetter alternatives that everyone\ncan enjoy snuggled up in bed this\ncoming winter.\nAbout Time (2013)\nRichard Curtis \u2013 it\u2019s probably\nfair to say \u2013 is something of an\nicon when it comes to romantic\ncomedies. From Love Actually to\nNotting Hill, the rom-coms he has\nwritten and occasionally directed are\ntrue classics. About Time is an often\nforgotten-about film of his, telling\nthe story of Tim who, at the age of\n21, discovers he can time travel and\nuses this to better his every day.The\nfilm\u2019s messages on life and love find\nthe director at his most sentimental.\nMamma Mia! (2008)\nMamma Mia! is probably the\ncheesiest film that I will admit to\nliking (and seeing multiple times\nin the cinema. Please don\u2019t tell\nanyone).The weight of an emotional\ndrama film seems wholly uninviting\nwhen you could have the kind of fun\na combination of ABBA songs and\nHollywood A-listers pissing about\ncan give you. With its gorgeous\nGreek island setting, Mamma Mia!\nis sure to fight the winter blues.\nWall-E (2008)\nTheysaytosavethebestforlastand\nWALL-E could well be the perfect\ndate night movie. Yes, I\u2019m serious.\nA gorgeous sci-fi epic, it boasts\nbrilliant action and fun alongside\nhonestly touching moments. The\nromance between WALL-E and\nEVE is always believable and never\ncheap \u2013 more than can be said for\nmost romantic films. The feel good\nending following some genuinely\nsad moments throughout will leave\nboth of you smiling.\nThe five most iconic moments of\nTilda Swinton\nLast week saw the 55th anniversary of the birth of the saviour of\nmodern cinema, Tilda Swinton. To celebrate, we take a look back\nat her legendary career; choosing what to feature was difficult, but\nwe have managed to narrow down five of her most iconic moments,\nand what they teach us about life and art\n1. Her\nCollaborations\nwith Derek\nJarman\nIt could be said that the die was\ncast as soon as Swinton appeared\nin her first film. Caravaggio, a\nfictionalised retelling of the Italian\npainter, was directed by Derek\nJarman, and would be the first of\nseven collaborations made until\nJarman\u2019s death in 1994. Resolutely\nart-house, but completely grounded\nin English temperament and history,\nJarman\u2019s work seemed to perfectly\n2. GenderBending in\nOrlando\nIf one was to make a list of\nunfilmable novels, Virginia Woolf\u2019s\nOrlando, a masterpiece of modern\nliterature, would be high on the\nlist: the story of a nobleman who\nsomehow lives for more than three\ncenturies, and changes sex half way\nthrough the plot, it is a complex,\nnuanced, convoluted exploration of\nthe messy nature of gender \u2013 and\ncompletely unfilmable. At least,\nuntil Sally Potter came along. Her\nOrlando, released in 1992, is one of\n3. Sleeping in\na Box in the\nName of Art\nSwinton\u2019s talents and interests lie\nbeyond the screen, as seen in her\n1995 collaboration with Cornelia\nParker RA, The Maybe. Coming\nto Parker with the idea for a\nperformance piece in which she\njust slept, the artist designed a glass\nvitrine, forming the centrepiece of\nthe Serpentine exhibition, in which\nSwinton slept (or at least appeared\nto) for seven hours a day.The Maybe\nhas since been restaged, in Rome in\n1996, and most recently at MoMA\nin 2013. For most actors, their\nactivities outside cinema lie mainly\n4. Learning\nNew\nLanguages for I\nAm Love\nI Am Love, Luca Guadagnino\u2019s\n2009 film about a Milanese\nindustrial family, saw Swinton\n5. Being Normal\nin Trainwreck\nWhen Amy Schumer wrote the\ndescription for tyrannical magazine\nboss Dianna in her film Trainwreck,\nshe described her as \u2018dressed like\nTilda Swinton would at an airport\u2019.\nLittle did she know that they would\nsoon have Swinton on board as\na collaborator; but more shocked\nwere the audience members \u2013 used\nto seeing Swinton as some kind of\nmercurial ice goddess with cropped\nperoxide hair, in Trainwreck she\ndons a long flowing wig, and hella\nmake-up in order to look\u2026 well,\npretty normal actually. She pulled\na similar trick in Lynne Ramsey\u2019s\nstarkly powerful We Need To Talk\nAbout Kevin, where she plays the\nmother of a boy who commits a\nschool shooting. Split between\nbefore and after the shooting, we\nsee her character of Eva physically\ntransformed by the immensity of\nher grief and guilt. It\u2019s a travesty\nthat she wasn\u2019t nominated for an\nAcademy Award for what is a career\nhighlight.\nWhile Trainwreck is perhaps the\nmostextremeofhertransformations,\nSwinton has a long history of\ndisguising herself before the camera.\nIn Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s masterfully dark\nmachinery dystopia Snowpiercer she\nplays Mason, the cynical enforcer of\norder on a train carrying the last of\nhumanity;devoid of human warmth,\nand given a horrible set of fake teeth,\nshe\u2019s channelling Margret Thatcher\nwith prosthetic floppy breasts.\nElsewhere, in Wes Anderson\u2019s\ndelightful The Grand Budapest Hotel,\nshe has a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it\ncameo as Madam D, the part-time\nlover of Ralph Fiennes\u2019 Gustav\nH \u2013 aged thirty years through the\nuse of elaborate make-up effects\nand cloudy contact lenses. Swinton\nclearly delights in messing around\nwith her appearance, eschewing the\ntraditionally enforced Hollywood\nnarrative of younger equals better,\nand striking a blow for equality.\nFRED FYLES\nsuit the ethereal qualities Swinton\nbrought to the screen; perhaps the\nlast great English auteur, his death\nwas a blow for experimental cinema,\none that \u2013 with the rise of Joanna\nHogg and Clio Barnard \u2013 we are\njust about getting over.\nThis early work grounded Swinton\nresolutely within the world of\nexperimentalism, and whilst she has\nmoved on to numerous big-budget\nproductions, she never seems to\nhave lost her original approach to\nthe medium: one of curiosity, love,\nand generousness. Without the\nattention of Derek Jarman back in\nthe 1980s, the Tilda Swinton we\nknow of today would probably not\nexist. As she said: \u2018he opened the\ndoor with a camera on me, and\nnever turned it off\u2019.\nthe cleverest adaptations of a novel\never to grace cinema; a sumptuous\nwork, the look and tone of the film\nis one of ravishment.\nAnd who else would be able to\nplay Orlando, the gender-switching\nimmortal, than Tilda Swinton?\nWith her angular face and beguiling\nair, Swinton displays the true spirit\nof androgyny. As Patti Smith said,\n\u2018she is both princess and prince\u2019, a\nquality she displayed when playing\nthe Archangel Gabriel in the 2005\nfilm Constantine, and will display\nagain next year in the upcoming\nfilm Doctor Strange, in which she\nhas not decided whether to play\nher character as male or female.\nSwinton has managed to transcend\nthe binary, showing us all that\ngender is truly performative.\nTilda\nSwinton is\ncinema\u2019s\ntrue\nmodern-day\npolymath\ntaking on perhaps her greatest\nchallenge yet. Playing a Russian\nEmigre\u00e9, she speaks Italian for\npretty much the entire film, with a\nfew scenes showing her speaking\nRussian. For any usual actor who\nwas not brought up bilingual (or\nat least learning a second language\nfrom an early age), such a prospect\nwould seem daunting, but Swinton\ntook to it like a duck to water,\ncrafting in Emma Recchi one of\nher most nuanced, rich characters\nto date.\nHer second feature collaboration\nwith Guadagnino, A Bigger Splash,\nsees her playing the famous rock\nstar Marianne Lane, and appearing\nin the latest issue of AnOther\nmagazine in character. A Bigger\nSplash was shown at the London\nFilm Festival last month and will\nA mercurial\nice-goddess\nwith great\nhair\nTilda Swinton serving face in Derek Jarman\u2019s 1988 film, The Last Of England.

But\nSwinton clearly knows how to pick\nher collaborators well, and stick\nwith them for the long haul: she\nfirst met Guadagnino over 20 years\nago, when he had only just finished\nfilm school. Not afraid to take on\ndangerous roles, Swinton appeals\nto other actors to raise their game,\nand bring the art of cinema up as\na whole\nin the fashion world, acting as\nmuses to designers, or appearing in\nhigh fashion advertising campaigns.\nSwinton has \u2013 of course \u2013 done her\nfair share of this, advertising for\nChanel and Pringle, and modelling\nin Viktor & Rolf shows. But her\ntalents and interests are diverse,\nwhether it\u2019s appearing as David\nBowie\u2019s wife in the video for The\nStars (Are Out Tonight), or helping\nto start an alternative school in rural\nScotland, Swinton is cinema\u2019s true\nmodern-day polymath.\nBEN COLLIER\n\n"

He spoke about about\nsecurity, both financial and national,\nreminding the assembled gaggle of\njournalists that despite the internet\nbeing \u201ccentral to modern life\u201d,\nits existence and use by terrorists\njustified the need for an increase in\nthe number of spies the government\nemploys.\nHe also mentioned that four\ngovernment departments \u2013\ntransport, food and rural affairs,\nlocal government and the treasury \u2013\nwill have their spending cut by 30%\nby the end of this parliament.\nHealth and international aid\nbudgets will be protected.

Call me\nmisanthropic if you want, but I\nthink my heart is at a perfectly\ngood temperature, thank you. If I\nwanted a heart served warm then\nI am more inclined to speak to\nFergus Henderson than to head\ndown to the cinema. Now, even\nthose patient readers amongst you\nwould now be inclined to throw\nup their hands and refuse to read\non: \u2018what kind of miserable review\u2019,\nthey may cry, \u2018could we expect from\nsomeone whose idea of a fun night\nis watching Michael Haneke films\nand contemplating death?\u2019 But fear\nnot, dear readers; as you may have\ngleaned from the rating above, I\nactually found Brooklyn \u2013 despite\nthe bright colour palate, the syrupy\nscore, despite, in other words, of its\nobvious heartwarming qualities \u2013\nreally pretty enjoyable.Trust me,I\u2019m\njust as surprised as you.\nAdapted by Nick Hornby from\nthe Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn novel, Brooklyn\ntells the tale of Eilis (Saoirse\nRonan), a young shop-worker from\na small Irish town, who is instructed\nby her mother to pack up her bags\nand travel across the Atlantic to\nAmerica, leaving behind her only\nsister. Beginning her life again\nin Brooklyn, with a job at a large\ndepartment store, she begins to\npiece things together; overcoming\nthe crushing homesickness she\nfeels, she enrols at night college,\nand meets Italian-American Tony\n(Emory Cohen), with whom she is\nsoon deeply in love. Of course, any\nplotline that carried on in such a\nsweet manner would be unpalatable,\neven to the normal movie-goer,\nand just when it seems that all is\ngoing well, disaster calls her back\nto Ireland, where she falls in love\nagain \u2013 this time with a native Irish\nlad, who has a modest fortune,\nand is played by handsome rogue\nDomhnall Gleeson to boot.\nSo now our Eilis is faced with\na crushing choice: be appallingly\nsatisfied in Brooklyn, or be\nappallingly satisfied in Ireland.\nAs you may guess, this film is\nfar from Sophie\u2019s Choice. Indeed,\nthe unquestioning nicety of her\nsuitors begins to get a little grating,\nand this reviewer longed for the\nmuch-needed injection of drama\nan unwanted pregnancy or backstreet abortion could bring. So, we\nunderstand that the film suffers\nfrom a serious lack of bleakness,\nwhich is for me a serious defect \u2013\nbut what about it is good? Well,\nfor starters there\u2019s Saoirse Ronan,\nwho is fast becoming one of the\nmost exciting Irish talents to grace\nour screens. Eilis is constantly\ntroubled by the situation around\nher, and Ronan\u2019s face conveys the\ntumultuous emotions churning\ninside as she struggles to adapt\nto her situation state-side. Julie\nWalters is cast well as Eilis\u2019 terse\n(but also warm, obviously) landlady.\nLike the cannon at the end of the\n1812 Overture, someone of Walters\u2019\ncalibre is wheeled on is when the\naudience demands a big, bombastic\nshow, and she certainly delivers,\nwith jokes about Jesus and nylons\ncoming in quick succession.\nThe cinematography is handled\nexcellently by Yves B\u00e9langer, who\nwas responsible for Wild and Dallas\nBuyers Club; interior scenes are\nSaoirse Ronan\u2019s resilient shopgirl Eilis, in John Crowley\u2019s Brooklyn..

Director\nJohn Crowley does a solid job, and\nwhile there are no shots that are\nespecially memorable, or would\nseem out of place in any number of\nhistorical dramas, the performances\nteased out of his cast reveal a sure\nand steady hand behind the camera.\nUltimately, however, Brooklyn\nloses out because of its leaning\ntowards sentimentality. T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s\nnovel does not shy away from\nthe sheer psychological trauma\nmoving half-way across the world\ncan wrought, and his handling of\nthe Irish diaspora experience never\nfeels celebratory, but is instead\nshot through with a searing sense\nof melancholy. In the film, such an\nissue does not seem to present itself.\nEilis seems to \u2013 apart from an early\nscene of homesickness \u2013 be equally\nat home in both worlds. We hear\na lot of the destitution in Ireland\nfrom the characters themselves,\nbut the pretty village streets of\nEilis\u2019 native town belie this fact.\nSapphic indications in the book\n\u2013 an important theme of T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s\n\u2013 are removed in favour of a much\nmore straightforward missionary-style approach to sexuality. Eilis\u2019\ncharacter is so incredibly passive \u2013\nshe leaves home nearly immediately\nat her mother\u2019s request, and there is\nthe sense that Tony isn\u2019t actually her\nsoul-mate, but instead the first man\nin Brooklyn to take an interest in\nher \u2013 that the fact we go along with\nher for the ride shows the strength\nof Ronan\u2019s talent.\nWhile Brooklyn is nothing but\nheartwarming,the efforts of the cast\nand director manage to stop it from\nmelting into unappealing mulch \u2013\nJohn Crowley is no Richard Curtis,\nthankfully. Saoirse Ronan is by far\nthe most interesting aspect of the\nfilm, which only cements her well-founded reputation for nuanced\nperformance. If you need a film to\ntake your granny to this week, or\nsomething to put in a loved one\u2019s\nstocking come Christmas,you could\ncertainlydoalotworsethatBrooklyn.\nViewers of a Bergmanesque\npersuasion will probably avoid the\nfilm at all costs, but if \u2013 like me \u2013\nthey go along for the ride, chances\nare they will shamefully, appallingly,\nshockingly come to enjoy it.\nDocumentary corner: Bowling for Columbine\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nM\nichael Moore\u2019s\ndocumentaries have\nalways been divisive.\nFor the most part,\npeople\u2019s opinions of his films seem\nto be based on their pre-existing\npolitical leanings; it\u2019s no secret that\nMoore, as a documentarian, is far\nfrom objective. But opinions aside,\nwhat makes Bowling for Columbine\ngreat is the depth and complexity\nwith which it explores its chosen\nissues.\nFrom the title, one might expect\nthe film to be solely a focused\nexploration of the Columbine High\nSchool massacre. This is far from\ntrue. The shooting merely acts as\na jumping off point for Moore to\nexpertly explore a number of other\ntopics, primarily the dangerous\ncombination of firearms and fear in\nmodern day America.\nOn the 20th\nof April 1999, the\nsmall county of Jefferson, Colorado,\nwas subject to one of the worst mass\nshootings in American history.High\nschoolers Eric Harris and Dylan\nKlebold shot and killed 13 students\nand teachers before turning their\nguns on themselves. Unfortunately,\nColumbine is now just one in a long\nline of gun massacres in the U.S.:\nfrom the Aurora shootings to Sandy\nHook, the debate around gun-control continues to this day. This\nspeaks to the continued relevance\nand importance of this film.\nWith a British anti-gun mind-set\nit is often infuriating to see Moore\ndebate with NRA members and\ngun advocates. If anything, the film\nperhaps places too little emphasis\non the link between gun ownership\nand gun-related homicides. Moore\nis clearly more focused on his main\nargument \u2013 the one against fear-mongering in the American media.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing\nhowever, and Moore should be\napplauded for the sheer breadth\nof interviews and segments he has\nassembled in order to make the\nargument.\nTwo interviews that really stand\nout, and place this film amongst\nsome of the best documentaries of\nall time, are those conducted with\nMarylyn Manson and Charlton\nHeston. Manson\u2019s interview in\nparticular is such a highlight that\nif you don\u2019t have time to watch the\nwhole film I\u2019d advise seeking it out\non YouTube.\nThe interview itself follows a\nsection discussing the various\nscapegoats used to explain the\nbehaviour of Eric & Dylan with\neverything from violent video games\nto action films being blamed by\nAmerica\u2019s conservative news media.\nIn his interview Manson gives us\ninsight into accusations made about\nhim at the time whilst making some\nof the best points in the film. When\nMoore asks Manson what he would\nsay to the boys if he had the chance\none quote in particular stands out;\u201cI\nwouldn\u2019t say a single word to them,\nI would listen to what they have to\nsay and that\u2019s what no one did\u201d.\nBowling for Columbine is\nincendiary, thought provoking, and\nyet very watchable. Ironic, dark\nhumour is sprinkled throughout as\nMoore retains his unique style of\nfilm-making.It would be impossible\nhere to touch on even half of the\npoints made in this film \u2013 Bowling\nfor Columbine really is essential\nviewing.\n\u2018From my cold, dead hands\u2019.

And you thought managing\nto put your underwear on the right\nway round this morning was an\nachievement.\nFollowing the publication of her\nmemoirs two years ago \u2013 a children\u2019s\nversion of which came out last year\n\u2013 it seems that a film was somewhat\ninevitable, and Davis Guggenheim,\ndirector of Oscar-winning An\nInconvenient Truth, has stepped up\nto the plate.\nHe Named Me Malala takes its\ntitle from the fact that Yousafzai\u2019s\nfather named her after an Afghan\nfolk hero who stood up to British\ninvaders, and paid with her life.\nIt seems to have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nHer father, an educator in\nPakistan, obviously encouraged her\nfrom an early age, and while the\nextent to which her father shaped\nher destiny is somewhat explored\nhere, it never really digs too deep,\nremaining firmly on the surface.\nTaking as its starting point\nMalala living safely in Birmingham,\nthe film then follows a looping\npattern, weaving in and out of\ndifferent points of Malala\u2019s life. In\none scene we find out about the\ncampaigning Malala did in her\nnative Swat Valley; in the next we\nsee her in Kenya, asking schoolgirls\nabout what they want to do when\nthey\u2019re older; in another she\u2019s\ninterviewed about why she can\u2019t\nhave a boyfriend. Unfortunately,\nthis means that the film lacks an\noverall narrative structure, inching\nslowly forward towards the Nobel\nPrize announcement, which is only\nrevealed over the credits.\nThe film does well to flesh out the\nMalala narrative, which \u2013 without\ncaution \u2013 could easily go down as\njust another heart-warming story of\ngood triumphing over evil. We see\nthe very real effects that the attack\nhas had on her life; not only the\nfact that she can\u2019t hear in one ear, or\nmove one side of her face properly,\nbut also her life-long struggle for\na normality that has eschewed\nBrooklyn\nDir: John Crowley Script: Nick\nHornby Starring: Saoirse Ronan,\nDomhnall Gleeson, Emory Cohen,\nJulia Walters 112 minutes.\nHe Named Me Malala\nDir: Davis Guggenheim.

Similarly, it\nhighlights the fact that this denial of\neducation is not a one-off situation,\nbut instead one that happens to\nchildren all over the world. One\nmemorable sequence takes place on\nthe Jordan-Syria border, and serves\nto remind us of the human factors\ninvolved when we pontificate about\nrefugee asylum. It is at points like\nthis the film is at its most real.\nA pity then that most of the film\neschews such realism, with Malala\nproviding the voiceover to mawkish\nanimation, or reconstructed\nsequences. Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 it is not\n\u2013 a sentiment that is only enforced\nby the end credits, which urge us to\nvisit the Malala Foundation website,\nand use the hashtag #withmalala.\nSuch aspects only support the idea\nthat we are, in essence, watching a\n90 minute advert for an education\ncharity. Brand-charity synergy may\nbe laudable, but it does not make a\ngreat documentary.\nFRED FYLES\nDo you stand #withmalala? Watch the film and find out. Photo Credit: Fox Searchlight\n\n"

I am only\ntoo content to flip a coin to match\nsocks, and wear stripes with plaid.\nI felt, going into The Fabric of India\nmuch like the fictional Bertram\nWooster, confessing to his trusted\ngentleman\u2019s gentleman: \u201cThere are\nmoments, Jeeves, when one asks\noneself, \u2018Do trousers matter?\u2019\u201d\nUltimately,this exhibition was not\nreally about India, but about why\nfabric matters, on a global scale.\nThe Indian subcontinent merely\nhappens to be one of the biggest\nplayers in the game. The first part\nof the exhibition focuses on nature.\nFor all that is materialistic and manmade about the world of garments\nand garb,it is inextricably tied to the\nnatural world for inspiration and for\nthe pillaging.The glorious tone that\nis Indigo \u2013 taking its name from\n\u2018India\u2019 \u2013 has been extracted from\nplants for millennia to colour yarn\nand fabric. And where else could we\nturn to for the bright exuberant reds\nbut the lac beetle, whose secreted\nresin is still used these days to make\ndye? Curiously, there is no efficient\nnatural source for green, a colour\nalmost synonymous with nature \u2013\ninstead, one combines yellow and\nindigo.\nBeforetheworldofthemechanical\nJacquard loom, it was up to the\ntalent and craftsmanship of weavers\nto make exquisite garments. On one\nhand, the perfection and intricacy\nof the designs are a testament to\na great art that has been lost with\nthe advent of machines, but on the\nother hand, there a sense of great\npoignancy to our proud exhibitions\nof imperfection: The pre-industrial\npoppy shawl demanded two days of\nwork from three craftsmen for every\nfew inches of fabric,and in this scale\nof effort and sheer hard work there\nis something other than mechanical\nperfection or a polished finishing to\nappreciate.\nIt is no wonder, then, that fabrics\ncame to represent a microcosm of\ncultural identity \u2013 the hopes, dream\nand fears of an entire people. It was\na stab at immortality,an opportunity\nto preserve for antiquity one\u2019s most\ninner identity in a piece of fabric.To\nuse the word \u2018antiquity\u2019 may seem\nlike a venture into hyperbole, but\nwhen I stand before a 6000-year-old piece of Indian fabric excavated\nin Jordon \u2013 intact and bursting with\ncolour \u2013 it appears as though the art\nof making and decorating fabric has\noutlived the majority of literature,\nsculpture, and visual art.\nThe oldest religious stories have\nbeen encoded in fabric, such as the\nKanamaraju epic, the Ramayana,\nand the Mahabharata \u2013 a 2,500 year\nold epic narrative (one of the oldest\nin the world) that is told and retold\nthrough countless metres of cloth.\nFabric is also central to Hindu\ntradition in the form of the sacred\nthread of the priest, the upavita.The\nculturalidentityofIndianChristians\nis also preserved in fabric; South\nIndian craftsmen drew on imagery\nfrom Armenian manuscripts to tell\nBiblical tales. Jain embroideries are\nembedded with sacred Kusha grass,\nand Tibetan lotuses line Buddhist\nprints.Often,words from the Quran\nare written into the fabric \u2013 the so\ncalled \u201cTalismanic shirt\u201d was worn\nunder battle dress and during times\nof illness. Islamic prayer mats are of\ngreat cultural importance because\nthey facilitate the touching of the\nforehead to the floor during prayer.\nIt is hard to imagine religious life\nin India without the significance\nof fabrics, and this point is driven\nhome rather well.\nOne of the biggest sections of the\nexhibition focuses on trade \u2013 there\nseems to be no country that India\nhas not borrowed from, or has not\nborrowed from India. Thanks to\nthe miracle of carbon dating, we\nknow that more than a thousand\nyears ago, Gujarati block prints\nwere a part of daily Egyptian life.\nMughal embroidery from the\n1600s depicts lilies, derived from\nEuropean botanical illustrations,\nwhile some hangings have cranes,\npine trees, oriental dragons, and\nintricate waterfalls all reminiscent\nof Japanese art. In Japan, Indian\nunder-kimonos were all the fad in\nthe 1800s, and in the same century\nEuropean men wore gaudy chintzes\nin public. An entire room is devoted\nto a 17-metre wall hanging from\nrural Gujarat that was found\ndumped on a New York pavement\ntwenty years ago outside a Brooklyn\nwarehouse. There is a breathtaking\nserendipity to it all \u2013 how did it get\nthere? How did it get back to the\nV&A? Moreover, there is a sense\nof humanity \u2013 a tall wall hanging\ndepicting European men was made\nto be hung together with two other\nhangings of Indian men and women,\nto create via dramatic juxtaposition\na gallery of human figures.\nThe climax of the exhibition\nappears to be with the political\nstatement made in 1920s India by\na certain weaver and cotton-spinner\nwho went by the name of Gandhi.\n\u2018Khadi\u2019 is the name of a type of\ncloth, but has come to represent\nan entire political movement,\nwhere the central ideology was\nthat Indians could be self-reliant\nand independent from the highly-priced British clothes (made from\ncheaply bought Indian cotton that\nwas exported to Britain to be woven\nand brought back to be sold at hefty\nprices). Central to the freedom\nstruggle was the symbolic act of\nrejecting foreign-made garments\nand wearing only hand-spun,\nhand-woven fabric. When Gandhi\ntravelled to the United Kingdom,\nhe continued to dress in khadi, fully\naware of its symbolism \u2013 Churchill\nbelieved that his style of clothing\nwas akin to political manipulation,\nDo trousers matter?\nThe V&A\u2019s Fabric of India reveals stories of culture and politics behind the woven craft\nAbhinav Varma\nWriter\ndescribing him as a \u201chalf-naked holy\nman\u201d. Gandhi would hold great\nspinning-wheel demonstrations\nwhere he not only taught the masses\nto make their own cotton thread\nbut also galvanised them to revolt.\nThe spinning wheel found its place\non the flag of the Indian Congress,\nthe first democratic political\nparty to come into power post-independence, and is symbolised by\nthe wheel on the flag even today.To\nthis day, the Indian flag continues\nto be made from hand-woven khadi\ncloth.\nIn these pieces of fabric, there is\nnothing less than a microcosm of an\nentire culture, an entire civilisation,\nand the lasting traces of their most\nbeautiful, and most important ideas.\nOverwhelmed by the powerful\nstatement of art, culture and the\nidentity made by something as\ninnocuous as a piece of cloth, I\nam forced to consider that there\nis a distinct possibility that when\nI reach for my coin and fumble\nthrough my wardrobe in the dark, I\nmight reconsider my callous pairing\nof socks and think to myself that\nperhaps, after all, trousers really do\nmatter.\nV&A until 10 Jan.

Those staff are sadly no longer\nwith us, but I would like to wholeheartedly\nencourage anyone with concerns to drop\nme a line at our special complaints address,\ndisciplinaryproceedings@imperial.ac.uk.\u201d\nThe weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building\nBlue3\nProvost Post of\nthe Week\nEach week, we like to\nprovide the opportunity for\none of our Vice Provosts to\nwrite a column on a topic of\ntheir choice. Providing our\nstaff with the opportunity to\ncommunicate to the masses\nin such a highly respected\norgan as Blue3\nis key to our\ncontinued commitment to\nstaff development here in the\nCube, which is why we\u2019re very\nproud to confirm that this\ncolumn \u2013 a popular feature\nin the old Blue News \u2013 will be\ncontinuing.\nIn a fond nod to those\ncolumns of old, we had tried\nto invite Al Pologies, the Vice\nProvost (Arbitrary Excuses),\nback for another pop at\nthe column, but when we\ntried to send him an email\n(a.pologies@imperial.ac.uk) we\ndiscovered he\u2019d been involved\nin the latest staff reshuffle, and\nhad actually been promoted\nto Vice President (Inadequate\nExplanations).\nIn his new role he is\nunfortunately far too busy to\nbe troubled with addressing\ncustomers, I mean students,\nand as such was regrettably\nunable to provide us with a\ncolumn for this week.\nAl has assured us (via his\nPA) that he will certainly be\nlooking into his current policy\non interacting with the \u2018plebs\u2019\nat some point in the near-to-far future, and will probably\nget back to us with some sort\nof answer within the current\nstrategic plan.\nOf course, Al\u2019s hectic work\nschedule (typical of the hard,\nlong hours carried out by all\nof our benevolent leadership\nteam) does still leave us without\na column for this week.\nFortunately, these editors\u2019\nnotes should have filled the\nwhole thing, so not to worry!\nNext time, look out for a special\ncolumn from the Vice Provost\n(Staff Management), Reese\nHuffle!\nHello, hello, hello and welcome back to Blue News! Or, should I say, hello3\nand welcome (for the first time) to Blue3\n\u2013 that\u2019s \u2018Blue Cubed\u2019, for all you\nmathematically-challenged folks out there! \u2013 our all-new newsletter for\nmembers of the Faculty Building.\nThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s out with the old and in with the new(s), as we\u2019ve given our\nbeloved workhorse newsletter a fresh lick of paint (blue, naturally) and sent\nit on its merry way into the big, wide world. We do hope you like what we\u2019ve\ndone with the place \u2013 the lovely boys (and girl!) in Comms assured me that\nBlue3\nwill look better than Blue News ever did, and should rightfully claim\npride of place in Imperial\u2019s arsenal of wonderfully-designed publications\n(except that rag Felix, of course).\nRe-branding and re-vamping is of course something we are very much \u201call\nabout\u201d, as the kids say here at Imperial. Our ability to continually reshape and\nreform our appearance in the face of unyielding expectations is one of our\nproudest assets, and has repeatedly proved essential to our survival. When\nconfronted with (unjustified) criticism, the capacity to change our appearance,\nand thus change the conversation, is vital to our wonderful successes here at\nImperial, and I\u2019m pleased as punch to include Blue3\nin this fine tradition.\nThis redesign has been in the works for several months now, with a regrettable\ndelay in publication meaning we missed the start of the undergraduate\nterm (and thus the chance to introduce the wonderful sources of delicious\ntuition fees to the vital work we do here in the Blue Cube!). However, the\nlovely boys (and girl!) in Comms assured me at the time that this was due\nto an unforeseeable issue with the espresso machine vastly restricting their\nworkflow. Understandable.\nNonetheless, this delay did give me a chance to discuss Blue3\nwith my good\nfriend Xi Jinping (the President of China, for the politically-challenged). When\nI told him about our dream of communicating all the vital work we do to the\nhuddled masses, yearning to pay more tuition fees, Xi laughed heartily. \u201cAlice,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cI admire your commitment to a state-run press. But why on earth do\nyou allow those filthy students to publish their own newspaper too?\u201d\nAlways one to ask the important questions, is Xi. But when I asked the lovely\nboys (and girl!) at Comms, they pointed out that we let the students publish\nthat rag Felix so we can print Blue3\nin it for free. Sounds like a good enough\nreason to me!\nHave a happy, prosperous, wonderful and collaborative week!\nFormerly \u2018Blue News\u2019\n\n"

Many\nof them only take minutes to\nplay; however, in these vignettes,\nFreeman pushes the boundaries\nof the medium more than any ten\nhour epic has ever been able to do.\nMuch of the appeal of Freeman\u2019s\nwork stems from her willingness to\nexplore themes that most developers\nfind uncomfortable. Take \u2018how do\nyou DO it\u2019 for example; it\u2019s a game\nabout a young girl trying to work\nout how sex works by positioning\ntwo dolls. In \u2018Freshman Year\u2019, she\nexplores the much more serious\nissue of unwanted attention. For\nsome, her games can be triggering\nor painful, but for others they\u2019re\noften comforting.\nFreeman offers a refreshing\nfemale perspective in an industry\ndominated by men. And by\nfocusing on her teenage years and\ntime at college, she is always able\nto make something that is easy for\nany millennial, regardless of sex, to\nengage with.\nHer latest game, \u2018Cibele\u2019, follows\nher online relationship with Blake,\na man she met while playing Final\nFantasy Online.

They paint a picture\nof a young women struggling with\nher own self-image and sexuality.\n\u2018Cibele\u2019 focuses on the awkward\ninteractions and self-confidence\nissues that are intertwined with\nonline communication and\nrelationships. Discovering your\nsexuality online in the 21st\ncentury\nis a far different experience from\nthat of our parents.\nAs a teenager, I always struggled\nto reflect on my own life quite like\n\u2018Cibele\u2019.\nThe flirting, sexting and awkward\ncompliments that take place online\nare no replacement for physical\nintimacy. And when we do extend\nan online relationship beyond\nthe web, it rarely lives to our\nexpectations. It\u2019s sad that future\ngenerations might discover their\nsexuality entirely through the\ninternet.\nWhile Freeman never expresses\nthis concern explicitly in \u2018Cibele\u2019,\nit\u2019s painfully obvious from\nthe disappointment that her\nrelationship ends\nThe power of sex plays an\nincreasingly important role\nthroughout the game and its ending.\nBut for a piece of work that Nina\nherself describes as being about sex,\nthe act itself is surprisingly absent.\nI have a lot of respect for Freeman.\nBy putting per own personal\nexperiences in a game she allows\nus to reflect on own lives in ways\nfew games have done in the past.\nThere were many times where I saw\nmyself in Blake and Nina.\nThere was a moment where I was\nreminded of the first time I told a\ngirl over Facebook that she was\n\u201ccute\u201d (a fact which she quickly\nrefuted).\nA game has never done that to me\nbefore.\nCibele by Star Maid Games is\navailable now on Steam\nNina Freeman\u2019s Cibele is a deeply personal vignette exploring the awkward sensuality\nof online relationships in your teens\nFreeman\npushes the\nboundaries\nof the\nmedium\nmore than\nany ten\nhour epic\ninteracting with the opposite sex\nin and outside of school.

After telling students\nthat Yale \u201cvalues free expression as\nwell as inclusivity,\u201d it went on to\nremind students to be aware that\ntheir costumes could be interpreted\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nRumbling racial tensions over Halloween costumes, censorship, and safe spaces\nhave caused some students to take direct action at the Ivy League school\nAmerican universities were once a safe space not only for\nmaturation but also for a certain regressive, or even transgressive,\nexperience; increasingly, it seems, they have become places of censure\nand prohibition. And the censure and prohibition come from above,\nnot from yourselves! Are we all okay with this transfer of power?\nHave we lost faith in young people\u2019s capacity \u2013 in your capacity \u2013\nto exercise self-censure, through social norming, and also in your\ncapacity to ignore or reject things that trouble you? We tend to view\nthis shift from individual to institutional agency as a tradeoff between\nlibertarian vs. liberal values (\u201cliberal\u201d in the American, not European\nsense of the word).\nNicholas says, if you don\u2019t like a costume someone is wearing, look\naway, or tell them you are offended. Talk to each other. Free speech\nand the ability to tolerate offence are the hallmarks of a free and open\nsociety.\nBut \u2013 again, speaking as a child development specialist \u2013 I think\nthere might be something missing in our discourse about the exercise\nof free speech (including how we dress ourselves) on campus, and it is\nthis: What does this debate about Halloween costumes say about our\nview of young adults, of their strength and judgment?\nIn other words: Whose business is it to control the forms of\ncostumes of young people? It\u2019s not mine, I know that.\nas offensive to marginalised groups.\nFour potentially problematic types\nof costume were named; \u2018funny\u2019,\n\u2018historical\u2019, \u2018religious\u2019 and \u2018cultural\u2019,\nwith each followed by questions\npotential party-goers should ask\nthemselves. Under the cultural\nbanner, the administrative staff\nasked, \u201cIf this costume is meant\nto be historical, does it further\nmisinformation or historical and\ncultural inaccuracies?\u201d\nWhile classic examples of\ndistasteful and downright offensive\ncostumes,like feathered headdresses\nand blackface, were named, the\nemail generally advised students\nto consider whether their costume\ncould potentially cause offense\nbefore they wore it.\nIn response, the Associate\nCollege Master of residence, Erika\nChristakis, sent out an email\ncomparing dodgy costume-wearing\nstudents to toddlers playing dress-up, mourning the lack of free\nspeech and questioning the validity\nof some points in the initial email\nasking for sensitivity when choosing\nHalloween costumes. She also\nquoted her husband on the matter,\nsaying, \u201cNicholas says, if you don\u2019t\nlike a costume someone is wearing,\nlook away, or tell them you are\noffended.\u201d\nIn response, 740 students signed\nan open letter to Christakis, calling\nher email \u201coffensive\u201d, berating her\ncomparisons between pre-schoolers\nand students, and for comparing\ncultural sensitivity with censorship.\nA thousand students took part in\na \u2018March of Resilience\u2019 on Monday,\nwith hundreds missing lectures to\nshow support.\nIn a heated exchange between Yale\nstudents,her husband,quoted in the\nemail, was filmed by a passer-by.\nAfter saying he didn\u2019t think his\nwife\u2019s email was making the college\nan unwelcome space for minorities,\none particularly upset student was\nfilmed screaming \u201cwhy the fuck\ndid you accept the position?\u201d at the\nprofessor.\nThe last few weeks have been\nmarred by accusations of racism at\nYale, after a Halloween frat party\nallegedly refused several black\nstudents entry, on account of it\nbeing a \u201cwhite girls only\u201d event.\nSigma Alpha Epsilon, a fraternity\nNicholas Christakis responds to\nstudents.

    "content": "PAGE 9\nfelixonline.co.uk FRIDAY 13th\nNOVEMBER 2015\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFEATURES\nV\nice President of Virgin\nGalactic and Imperial\nalumnus, Jonathon Firth,\nis involved in developing\nthe first commercial spaceflight\ncompany. He attended the 2015\nSpaceLab conference last month,\nwhere he cornered him for an\ninterview.\nFELIX: Would you mind telling\nus a little about your background,\nand how you ended up at Imperial?\nJF: I studied Mechanical\nEngineering at Imperial, and\nam actually a fourth generation\nmechanical engineer. I was born\nin Cumbria, and grew up in\nManchester. Imperial seemed like\nthe place to go when it came to\napplying to university, so I ended\nup here. My son is actually also\na mechanical engineer, so it\u2019s\nsomething of a family profession,\neven though I didn\u2019t steer him\ntowards it.\nFELIX: During your time at\nImperial, is there anything in\nparticular that you learnt that\u2019s\nstuck with you?\nJF: I think I learnt how to enjoy\nmyself. I went to an all boys\u2019 school\nbefore university, but coming here\nreally opened me up.I did IC Radio,\nand was on the publications board\nwhilst here. In my third year I also\nchaired the Union general meetings.\nOverall, it opened up my social\nside and some of the things that\nI did were very good experience;\nfor example public speaking and\nworking with limited finances.\nFELIX: Is there anything\nparticularlycrazythatyouremember\nhappening whilst here?\nJF: The most memorable thing\nwas definitely the Iranian Embassy\nHostage Crisis. I was in Weeks Hall\n[a former Imperial hall of residence\nin Princes\u2019 Gardens, now closed] at\nthe time, revising for exams, and it\nwas Easter of 1980. After the first\nhostages were taken there were\nsecurity people everywhere \u2013 asking\nus who we were, where we were\ngoing, and so on.\nIt ended with the Embassy\nbeing stormed, and a huge fire. We\nwatched from the warden\u2019s flat at\nthe top of the hall as the SAS took\nthe building.\nFELIX: And after Imperial, how\ndid you end up at Virgin Galactic?\nJF: After graduation I ended up\nworking in oil and gas. I\u2019d always\nliked doing \u2018projects\u2019, and the oil\nindustry had plenty of those for me\nto do.I started out as a pressure vessel\nengineer, but knew that I didn\u2019t\nwant a technical career. Rather, I\nwas more interested in how people\nwork together on projects, and so\non. However by 1981 the business\nwas starting to tail off a little, as the\noil price began to fall.\nSo, I ended up working on\nmass-transit projects for London\nUnderground, specifically on the\nmodernisation of the Central and\nNorthern Lines. This included\nsome interesting ideas, for example\na joint public/private partnership\nto fund the rolling stock. Virgin\nwas looking at this model after the\nprivatisation of British Rail, and\napproached me to work on the West\nCoast Mainline and Cross Country\nfranchises, which they had just won.\nTheindustrywasintransformation,\nbut it wasn\u2019t an area I\u2019d worked in\nbefore. After time with the railways\ndivision of Virgin, I ended up\nworking for Virgin Atlantic, and\nthen someone asked me if I wanted\nto move to Virgin Galactic \u2013 and\nthat\u2019s how I ended up there.\nFELIX: Did you have any\nparticular interest in space before\nthat?\nJF: I didn\u2019t have any particular\nprofessional interest in space, but\nthere was definitely a casual interest.\nI knew lots of space scientists,\npeople who remembered watching\nthe Moon landings in the 1960s,and\nHelen Sharman getting selected as a\nUK astronaut in the 1980s was also\nquite exciting. Besides, at Virgin we\nnever quite knew what was going to\nhappen in the next week!\nFELIX: Richard Branson \u2013 what\u2019s\nit like working with him?\nJF: He\u2019s always interested in\nwhat\u2019s going on, but he does make\nsure to let the management team\nrun things. It\u2019s a bit like branded\nventure capital in a way? It is good\nthough that he keeps in touch and\ncomes to milestone events, and he\u2019s\nalways said that he\u2019ll be on the first\ncommercial flight.\nFELIX: So what would you say\nthe fundamental reason for Virgin\nGalactic\u2019s existence is?\nJF: Well, it is in effect customer\nexperience driven engineering. Our\nproduct needed to be something\nthat satisfied the pilots who wanted\nto fly in space as well as in planes,\nthe baby boomers who remembered\nthe Apollo missions, and also the\nthrill seekers.\nInitially, the company was\nstructured to do just this. We\u2019d\nrefined the model over time, for\nexample moving away from the idea\nof having a single-person spaceship.\nNow we also plan to branch out\nand launch small satellites off of the\nparent vehicle. We want to make\nsure we accommodate the customer\u2019s\nneeds, rather than making them\nconform to our specifications in the\nway that most other space launch\ncompanies do. Fundamentally, we\nwant to be flexible and available \u2013\nsomeone once used the phrase the\n\u2018Uber of Space\u2019 to describe us.\nFELIX: For someone looking\nto go into the space industry as a\nAlumnus goes Galactic\nJonathon Firth used to go to Imperial, now he\u2019s busy building\nRichard Branson\u2019s commercial space travel business\nWhen your boss is so hands on, he offers to fly in your first spaceship. Photo Credit: Virgin\nSomeone\nonce used\nthe phrase\nthe \u2018Uber of\nSpace\u2019 to\ndescribe us\ncareer,is there anything in particular\nthat you would recommend?\nJF: The UK has great ambitions to\ngrowitsspaceindustry\u2013forexample,\nit wants to have 10% of the world\u2019s\nmarket share by 2030. It won\u2019t be\nable to do this unless it can attract\ntalent. So I would say follow your\ninterests and passions, but overall I\nwould recommend engineering. It\ngives you a wide range of areas to\nwork in and does not predestine you\nto a particular field. I also think it\ngives you sound judgement \u2013 you\nmight not know the right answer,\nbut you know the sounds that the\nwrong answer makes.\nFELIX: So what should people\nfollow \u2013 passion, or interest?\nJF: It has to be a balance. You\nhave to make a living as well, so I\u2019d\nsay think about the salary but don\u2019t\nmake it all about that.\nFELIX: And what is it that\ninspires and motivates you?\nJF: I think I\u2019m one of those people\nwho are self-motivated, in a way it\u2019s\nbaked in. That\u2019s partly a product of\nmy upbringing and partly a product\nof coming to Imperial. I never wait\nto be asked to do something. I can\nsit read a book to relax, but will\nnever do nothing.\nFELIX: Okay, so what would a\ntypical day look like for you?\nJF: To be honest, it probably\nwouldn\u2019t be particularly exciting!\nThere\u2019s normally something on the\noutreach side every other day, which\nis good. Our spaceport is out in the\nMojave Desert in New Mexico,\nbut occasionally I find myself back\nin London which I like. I spend a\nlot of time on reports, talking to\nstakeholders and customers and in\ndiscussions with employees, just the\nsame as everyone else.\nFELIX: Would you want to be\non one of Virgin Galactic\u2019s first\ncommercial flights then?\nJF: Absolutely, I always assumed\nthat I would be. Once upon a time\nwe all thought that we were going\nto be flying, back when it was just\nfive or six of us. Now there\u2019s 520\npeople in the company, so we won\u2019t\nall be flying. Possibly after testing\nis completed but before entry into\nservice we\u2019ll a chance for some\nemployees to try it out.\nFELIX: That sounds very cool.\nAnyhow, thank you very much for\nyour time!\nBen Fernando & Parikshat\nSingh\nWriters\n\n"
