    "content": "TELEVISION\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nA bewildering journey into Ancient Greece\nWith the demise of Merlin, the\nBBC were clearly in the market for\na new family-friendly fantasy drama to fill the Saturday evening slot.\nEnter Atlantis, a retelling of the\nlegend of Greek hero Jason, best\nknown as leader of the Argonauts\nand slayer of the minotaur. Well,\n\u2018retelling\u2019 is perhaps a slight ex-aggeration: in reality, Atlantis features a bizarre mish-mash of Greek\nmythology with real historical fig-ures, with an extra dash of time\ntravel to keep things interesting.\nIf the above sounded confusing,\nthen welcome to my reaction as I\nsettled down to watch the first epi-sode. We open in the present day,\nwith our young hero Jason preparing to journey underwater in\nsearch for his father, lost at sea in\na submarine accident. As the underwater vehicles ventures into the\ndepths, Jason finds himself sucked\ninto an oracle (helpfully labelled\n\u2018Oracle\u2019) which is apparently a\nportal to the ancient city of Atlantis - before it sank into the sea, that\nis. This portal has the additional\nfeature of stripping its user of all\nclothes, leaving Jason washed up,\nstark naked, on an empty beach.\nJason, although having a body\nsculpted by angels, is apparently\nnot too bright, as upon entering Atlantis (now, unfortunately,\nclothed) he manages to piss off a\ntwo-headed lizard into chasing him\naround the marketplace, leading to\nmuch unnecessary destruction and\ndisruption. He\u2019s finally rescued\nby a young man his own age, who\nintroduces himself as Pythagoras.\nIt\u2019s at this point that the show\u2019s\ndecision to conflate the entirety of\nGreek mythology with actual ancient history becomes jarring: I\u2019m\ncompletely on board with magic\nunderwater portals to legendary\ncities, but Pythagoras was a real\nhistorical figure born circa 560\nBC, whereas the story of Jason\nand the Argonauts is set around\n1300 BC, a generation before the\nTrojan war, and was already being\ntold as a bedtime story in 800 BC.\nAny further semblance of adhering to historical accuracy is thrown\nout of the window when Pythagoras introduces his housemate, the\ndemi-god Hercules - now a washed\nup, chubby alcoholic, played by\nGame of Thrones\u2019 Mark Addy.\nJason and Pythagoras become\nbest mates after a Hunger-Gamesstyle ceremony to select the annual sacrifices to the local minotaur results in Jason volunteering\nin the young mathematician\u2019s\nplace. After slaying the minotaur\nwith some help from a beautiful princess, Jason is accepted as\nthe hero and saviour of Atlantis,\nshowing remarkably little concern\nwith getting back to everyone he\u2019s\nleft behind in the modern world.\nPresumably, at some point the\nshow will build up to Jason\u2019s epic\nquest sailing around the Mediterranean in search of the famed Golden\nFleece which will restore his rightful throne. Personally, I\u2019d like to\nsee the episode where, according\nto legend, Pythagoras goes mental and kills a load of his followers because he can\u2019t get his head\naround irrational numbers (to be\nfair, I struggled with the concept\nas well), but I have a feeling that\nthis is another part of ancient Greek\nhistory which will be shelved.\nFor anyone who watched Merlin,\nthe similarities are plain to see - lots\nof talk about destiny, a vaguely ho-moerotic friendship between two\nyoung men from different walks\nof life, some less than stellar CGI\nmonsters - and at times, Atlantis\ndoes seem to be lacking in original-ity. Perhaps I\u2019m being too harsh on\nwhat is, after all, the first episode\nof a family show designed for light\nentertainment; The Iliad it ain\u2019t,\nbut Atlantis is entertaining enough,\nif you\u2019re prepared to throw logic\nout of the window and go along\nwith the ride. For that reason, the\nshow may be worth sticking with\nfor a few more episodes to see if it\npicks up; if nothing else, to see how\nmany other Greek mythological figures they can fit into the one show.\nEmily Fulham reviews the latest fantasy offering from the BBC\nA friendly conversation takes a sudden turn for the worst when Pythagoras gets asked to find the square root of two...\n21\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\n\n"

If this is your \ufb01rst time\nreading these pages then congratulations are in order;\nmanaging to tear your eyes away from the centrefold\nand pursuing something a bit more academic, and so\nearly on in the year too, is no mean feat. To all our\nregular science enthusiasts (we know who you are,\nall ten of you) welcome back - we are hoping to hit\nharder than ever this year and make sure we deliver up\nto date science with a minimum of one pun per title.\nI\u2019m Philippa and I make up a third of the science\neditorial team alongside Keir, a charismatic chemist\nand Fiona, a bubbling biologist like myself. If you are\na physicist, a mathematician or even an engineer,\nget in touch and start writing for us! Otherwise it is\ngoing to be articles alternating between the ecology\nof guppies and scandals involving titration curves.\nMy top science story this week is that of the chemist\nwho was recently jailed for killing her husband. Akin\nto the Breaking Bad storyline in that basically lab\nsupplies were stolen and someone then dies, Tianle Li\nfrom New Jersey slowly poisoned computer engineer\nXiaoye Wang when their marriage disintegrated.\nUnlike Breaking Bad, this chemical crime did not pay\no\ufb00 in thousands of dollars and hundreds of Emmy\nnominations, but instead resulted in a life sentence for\nthe mother-of-one after a science-savvy nurse worked\nout that his symptoms pointed to thallium exposure.\nhallium ions are chemically similar in size to\npotassium ions, rendering the cellular channels for\npotassium useless in distinguishing between them both.\nhallium is able to enter cells and disrupts the normal\nion movement of potassium, causing a whole host of\nbiochemical issues. Only one gram of thallium can kill\na human, and as it causes a large range of symptoms,\npoisoning may not be diagnosed until it is too late.\nAlthough Li pleaded not guilty, the research\nshe conducted with biopharmaceutical company\nBristol-Myers Squibb was centred on the e\ufb00ect\nof thallium on humans, so accessing the banned\nsubstance would have been just too easy. hallium is\nsoluble in water, so administration would have been\nstraightforward, too: a slip of the wrist by seemingly\ninnocent Li would have been all it took to get the\nsubstance into her husband\u2019s drink with dinner.\nSince it can be di\ufb03cult to diagnose, by the\ntime Xiaoye\u2019s symptoms were linked to thallium\npoison there was no time to get the rare antidote,\nPrussian blue, and the damage was done.\nSo if writing about that latest pathogen pathway\ndoesn\u2019t \ufb02oat your boat, consider diving into the\ndecidedly dark side of science instead. Get in touch,\nwrite about your favourite toxin and share your science\nstories:anythingthatpacksapunchissuretobeprinted.\nBlood, snot and students\nFiona Hartley tells us why scientists will soon be\nadding a new weapon to our arsenal against flu\nI\u2019m sure several of you are su\ufb00ering\nwith freshers\u2019 \ufb02u by now, as I am, because sharing your germs via sniffling\nand/or coughing on your unfortunate\npeers in lectures is akin to physical intimacy here at Imperial. You\u2019d rather\nbe healthy, or at least in bed, as you\nsip your Lemsip Max and wish that\nyou hadn\u2019t shuffled through crowds\nof virus-laden students in the QTR at\nFreshers\u2019 Fair.\nWhile Freshers\u2019 \ufb02u is basically a bad\ncold that makes us feel a bit shit right\nwhen we want to be out on the town\nenjoying ourselves the annual \ufb02u epidemic is a much more serious a\ufb00air.\nIn\ufb02uenza always poses a potentially\nserious risk to our health and that remains a fact despite sensationalised\nnews reports claiming the latest pandemic will kill millions of people. (I\ndo realise that I\u2019m guilty of the same\nthing, referring to war in the title\nof this article \u2013 but how else do you\nmake a future \ufb02u vaccine sound excit-ing? Please tell me\u2026)\nA vaccine that is e\ufb00ective against all\nstrains of \ufb02u is described as the \u2018Holy\nGrail\u2019 for in\ufb02uenza researchers. Last\nweek Imperial demonstrated its dedication to this goal when Professor Ajit\nLalvani and his team published their\nconclusions from a two-year long\nstudy of the health of 342 sta\ufb00 and student volunteers in Nature Medicine.\nhe study began in the autumn of\n2009 when the swine \ufb02u pandemic\nwas starting. Previous models had\nsuggested that T-cells, the little lymphocytes which are crucial in the cell-mediated immune response, could\nrecognise core proteins within the in\ufb02uenza virus and perhaps confer some\nprotection against symptoms of \ufb02u.\nhe team used the pandemic to explore this theory. Once the volunteers\nhad donated blood samples and nasal\nswabs, they were sent a health survey\never three weeks and asked to donate\nanother nasal swab if they su\ufb00ered\nfrom any symptoms of in\ufb02uenza.\nhe group found that the volunteers\nwho su\ufb00ered from milder symptoms\nof \ufb02u when infected had a greater\nnumber of CD8+ T-cells in their\nblood at the beginning of the study.\nProfessor Lalvani called the \ufb01ndings\na \u201cblueprint\u201d to guide future vaccine\ndevelopment. heir study contains\nprecise information about the characteristics of the protective T-cells\nand this can be incorporated into the\ntesting of novel in\ufb02uenza vaccines, as\nwell as potentially leading to a vaccine\nthat stimulates a T-cell response large\nenough to have the desired protective\ne\ufb00ect.\nSo your nasal secretions contain\nmore value than you might \ufb01rst think.\nAnd while I\u2019d prefer a greater number\nof volunteers to have been part of the\nstudy, I think it\u2019s great that students\nwere indirectly involved. Imagine being one of them, smug in the knowledge that the disgusting river which\ndribbled out of your nose four years\nago in\ufb02uenced the advancement of\nscience\u2026\nhis is good news for the future of\n\ufb02u vaccination and our general health.\nIt will be many long years before in\ufb02uenza is a thing of the past, however; I\nsuppose it will be even longer before\nwe see the back of freshers\u2019 \ufb02u.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an\ninapt analogy\nto compare\nthis to light\nsabers\u201d\nNew form of matter created from photons\nKeir Little\nScience Editor\nhe Harvard-MIT Center for\nUltracold Atoms has created\n\u201cphotonic molecules\u201d by binding\nphotons together, as published in\nNature last week.\nhe team, led by Harvard\u2019s Professor\nMikhail Lukin and MIT\u2019s Professor\nVladan Vuletic, \ufb01rst cooled an\nextremely rare\ufb01ed gas of rubidium\natoms to a few degrees above absolute\nzero, then used weak laser pulses to\n\ufb01re single photons into the gas.\nIn this medium, the photons are\nslowed considerably by interacting\nwith and giving energy to the rubidium\natoms. \u201cWhen the photon exits the\nmedium, its identity is preserved,\u201d\nLukin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same e\ufb00ect we see\nwith refraction of light in a water glass.\nhe light enters the water, it hands\no\ufb00 part of its energy to the medium,\nand inside it exists as light and matter\ncoupled together, but when it exits, it\u2019s\nstill light. he process that takes place\nis the same, it\u2019s just a bit more extreme\n- the light is slowed considerably, and\na lot more energy is given away than\nduring refraction.\u201d\nWhen two photons are \ufb01red in,\nthey exit joined together, as if in a\nmolecule. his is due to an e\ufb00ect\ncalled the Rydberg blockade, which\ndisallows atoms near to each other\nbeing excited to the same state. When\ntwo photons are in the rubidium\ncloud, one must move forward after\nexciting an atom so that the second\none can move in and excite other\natoms nearby. hus, the photons pull\nor push on each other as they move\nthrough the medium.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a photonic interaction that\u2019s\nmediated by the atomic interaction,\u201d\nLukin said. \u201chat makes these two\nphotons behave like a molecule, and\nwhen they exit the medium they\u2019re\nmuch more likely to do so together\nthan as single photons.\n\u201cWe do this for fun, and because\nwe\u2019re pushing the frontiers of science,\nbut it feeds into the bigger picture of\nwhat we\u2019re doing because photons\nremain the best possible means to\ncarry quantum information. he\nhandicap, though, has been that\nphotons don\u2019t interact with each\nother.\u201d\nhe e\ufb00ect could be used to make\nphotonic switches or logic gates for\nuse in quantum computers, or for\nlaser cooling and information transfer\napplications in current computers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an inapt analogy to compare\nthis to light sabers,\u201d Lukin added.\n\u201cWhen these photons interact with\neach other, they\u2019re pushing against\nand de\ufb02ect each other. he physics of\nwhat\u2019s happening in these molecules is\nsimilar to what we see in the movies.\u201d\nMIKHAIL LUKIN, VLADAN VULETIC/NATURE\nWant to write for us?\nEmail to get involved:\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Because of the\noverlapping lifestyles that can be associated with both cocaine use and\nHIV infection, this is a particularly\nworrying new piece of research, and\nindicates that cocaine users are more\nat risk than previously thought of contracting the deadly disease.\nUsually, HIV functions by infecting\nCD4 Cells, which are a type of T helper cells. T helper cells are white blood\ncells that, upon detecting infection,\nactivate other immune cells around\nthem by releasing chemical messengers known as cytokines. hey trigger\na cascade of immunological activity,\nbringing together other components\nof the immune system to remove any\nthreat as efficiently and as successfully\nas possible. hey \u201chelp\u201d the immune\nsystem in getting its act together, to\ncombine forces and tackle the infection head on.\nHIV is so potent because it breaks\ndown the prime defence mechanism\nthe body has against infection, e\ufb00ectively bringing the enemy down from\nthe inside. HIV infects the CD4 TCells, causing them to burst or be targeted by other cells for degradation.\nhis causes the number of CD4\nCells to decrease, weakening the ability of the di\ufb00erent cells within the immune system to join forces together\nand \ufb01ght o\ufb00 future infections. his\nis why HIV doesn\u2019t kill patients directly Acquired Immunode\ufb01ciency\nSyndrome (AIDS) is when the CD4\nT-Cell count drops so low the patient\nhas, as the name suggests, a de\ufb01cient\nimmune system and cannot \ufb01ght o\ufb00\ninfections. hese opportunistic infections can be caused by a whole host of\nmicroorganisms, and lead to adverse\nsymptoms when there is no immune\nsystem to sti\ufb02e them.\nhe scientists who conducted the\nstudy collected blood from human\ndonors that were healthy, isolated the\nCD4 T-Cells and then exposed them\nto cocaine over a period of three days.\nhen it was simply a case of watching\nand waiting- the researchers monitored the progression of the HIV life-cycle, and saw that in cells bathed in a\ncocaine-derived solution, there was a\nsigni\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence in infection rates\nand subsequent new viral production\nto those that remained cocaine free.\nhis may be facilitated by receptors\non the CD4 cells that are agonists for\ncocaine, rendering cells more susceptible to HIV infection, but as is the\ncase with many of these things, more\nresearch is needed. Worryingly, these\nreceptors are agonists for a plethora\nof other drugs too, and as of yet it is\nunknown if these too may increase the\npossibly of HIV infection for such essential immunological cells.\nDOI:10.1189/jlb.1112566\nLink found between HIV and cocaine\nThe HIV virus.\nFORCOLLEGEANDCOMMUNITY\nICRADIO.COM\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE RADIO\nWant to get involved?

Viewed as a collection, rather\nthan individual artworks, the pieces\ngive a coherent view of the human\nqualities that we attribute to natural\nmaterials.

    "content": "COMMENT\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\nM\nost students at\nImperial are men. I\ndon\u2019t imagine this\ncomes as much of\na surprise to most\nFelix readers. While this gender\nimbalance is obvious from the\n\ufb01rst day of Freshers Week, what it\nmeans and how to talk about it can\nbe more challenging. Whispered\nremarks about \u201che Ratio\u201d can be\nheard on most courses and jokes\nabound about the sexual frustration\nof Imperial\u2019s males; the straight ones\nat least. But beyond this, any serious\ndiscussion of gender among students\ncan often be dismissed. We can be\npretty poor at talking gender and\nit\u2019s we men who seem to do it worst.\nhe low proportion of women\nstudents at Imperial is not the\nCollege\u2019s fault and in fact when\ncompared to the science, engineering\nand medicine departments in the\nrest of the UK, we have slightly more\nequal gender ratio than average. his\ndoes not mean, however, that there\nis nothing to be discussed. When\nposters went up last year in the\nchemistry department showing the\nproportion of female researchers in\nthe di\ufb00erent groups, it was graffitied\nwith \u201cSo? Problem?\u201d Posters inviting\nfemale physics students to a female-only event were graffitied with\ncomments calling the event \u201csexist\u201d.\nhese comments are massively\nunhelpful and entirely miss the point.\nIt can be tempting to think that simply\nremoving legal barriers to female\nacademics is sufficient to right historic\nwrongs. A glance at the progress of\nAfrican Americans since the end of\nlegal segregation in 1954 suggests\notherwise. It is quite right that we\nmake a particular e\ufb00ort to encourage\nschoolgirls to be interested in science\nand for women undergraduates\nto pursue their subjects further.\nWhen we men are dismissive of\nthe idea, we serve the status quo.\nLast week a mini Twitter storm\nbroke out over an upcoming science\nevent in the Excel Arena of Olympic\nfame. he event features 6 panelists\nincluding Richard Dawkins and\nBill Bailey, which is a very cool and\noriginal combination. Less original\nis the gender makeup of the panel,\nall 6 speakers are men. As with\nImperial, it is not the fault of the\norganisers if these were genuinely\nthe best candidates. Where they\nmessed up was with the FAQ on their\nwebsite, which addressed lack of\nwomen. hey said; \u201cI am a fanatical,\nmisandristic \u2018feminist\u2019. May I drone\non about the lack of women in the\nline-up and despatch bigoted, mis-spelt, ungrammatical missives to\nthe organisers and presenters?\u201d \u201cNo.\nPlease save your talents for Twitter\nand Facebook, that\u2019s what they\u2019re\nfor. We\u2019re actually very disappointed\nthat none of our female invitees\naccepted, but that is just how it was.\nAs scientists we have no choice but\nto accept reality. Wanting something\nto be otherwise does not make it so.\u201d\nYes, this is supposed to be\ncomically exaggerated language\nbut even ignoring the labelling of\nthose who complain of the lack of\nwomen speakers as \u201cbigoted\u201d and\n\u201cmisandristic\u201d, the FAQ\u2019s message is\nquite clear; put up and shut up. We\nshould do neither. It is quite right\nand reasonable to wonder why the\norganisersfailedto\ufb01ndasinglewoman\npanelist. It may indeed be the case that\nthey really did try, but this is hardly\nthe \ufb01rst panel event on science to be\nall male, and maintaining the status\nquo allows a self ful\ufb01lling prophesy\nwhereby men gain higher pro\ufb01les\nfrom speaking at events which leads\nthem to be invited to more events.\nIt may not be up to this particular\nevent to \u201c\ufb01x\u201d this, but to brush it away\nas a non-issue is wilful ignorance.\nMen of Imperial, we can do better\nthan this. To question why the gender\nimbalance is as it is not to question\nwhether any one of us deserves to\nbe here or to suggest that College\ndiscriminate in favour of women\nstudents and employees. Students\nare right to challenge the status quo\nand make active e\ufb00orts to encourage\nwomen scientists in College and\nfurther a\ufb01eld. Dismissing these\ne\ufb00orts as \u201csexist\u201d is lazy. he Excel\nevent told us that \u201cas scientists we\nhave no choice but to accept reality.\u201d\nhis is a strange de\ufb01nition of science.\nRather, as scientists we examine\nreality, come to understand how it\nworks and \ufb01nd out how to change it.\nScientists do not simply accept reality.\nImperial Men: How To Talk About Gender\nNew courses to broaden your education and enhance your potential\nFor all irst year undergraduates.

    "content": "FILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRunner Runner, this film is a mess\nI was reasonably hopeful going\ninto the cinema. Ben A\ufb04eck has\nbeen very cautious choosing which\n\ufb01lms he acts in lately; since 2010 he\nhas only been in \ufb01lms he directed\nhimself and a Terrence Malick drama.\nJustin Timberlake hasn\u2019t quite had a\nbreakout performance, but he\u2019s been\nconsistently solid in every \ufb01lm he\u2019s\nbeen in. And director Brad Furman\nhad previously directed the very well\nreceived thriller he Lincoln Lawyer.\nhere was nothing to suggest this \ufb01lm\nwas going to be as awful as it turned\nout.\nRunner Runner is the story of Richie\nFurst (Timberlake), a savvy university\nstudent who tries to win enough\nmoney playing online poker to pay for\nhis tuition fees. But then it isn\u2019t. hen\nit\u2019s the story of how he is cheated out\nof his money and has to go to Costa\nRica to \ufb01nd the poker website\u2019s shady\nowner Ivan Block (A\ufb04eck). But then it\nisn\u2019t. hen it\u2019s the story of him having\nto work in the corrupt, Costa Rican\ngambling-based economy. But then...\nyou get the point.\nWith seemingly no focus on\nanything resembling a plot the \ufb01lm\ntrudges along, scene after scene in\nwhich stu\ufb00 happens but none of it\nmatters. Characters jump in and out\nMichael S. Martin\nWriter\nRunner Runner\nDirector: Brad Furman\nWriters: Brian Koppelman, David\nLevien\nStarring: Justin Timberlake, Ben\nAffleck, Gemma Arterton\nRuntime: 91 minutes\nCertification: 15\nof the plot, relatively important events\nare either forgotten or postponed to\naccommodate another scene of Richie\nand Ivan having a party. he one\nplotline that stays consistent is one\nof the dullest romantic subplots ever\nput on \ufb01lm, between Richie and Ivan\nBlock\u2019s colleague Rebecca Shafran\n(Arterton).\nhere is at one point a small sliver\nof hope that Ivan Block will turn out\nto be a sociopath, which would make\nit somewhat interesting to see how\na sociopath would operate within\nthe extreme corruption and brutal\npolicing of Costa Rica. But then he\ndoesn\u2019t. Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake\nplays the same character he played in\nhe Social Network without the sharp,\nAaron Sorkin dialogue that made\nhis scummy persona entertaining.\nWithout it he puts on a performance\nso wooden he should\u2019ve been credited\nas Justin Timberocean.\nIn the end, while some bits of it\nare abysmal, nothing in the \ufb01lm\nis o\ufb00ensively bad. At least in that\ncase there would be some reason\nto recommend it. Instead it is just\nvery, very dull. I have a soft spot for\ngambling \ufb01lms, even ones that are\nadmittedly not good. But at least\nthose \ufb01lms have a clear idea of where\nthey start and where they want to go.\nRunner Runner starts everywhere and\ngoes nowhere.\nThe Blue Woman Group\nMichael S. Martin\nWriter\nBlue Jasmine\nDirector: Woody Allen\nWriter: Woody Allen\nStarring: Cate Blanchett, Sally\nHawkins, Bobby Cannavale,\nLouis C. K., Alec Baldwin\nRuntime: 98 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nJasmine French (Blanchett) is a hard\ncharacter for Imperial students to\nrelate to: she\u2019s rich, she wants to go\ninto interior decorating, she knows\nnothing about \ufb01nance, and she\u2019s a\nwoman. he \ufb01lm intercuts scenes\nfrom two periods of her life; one shows\nthe ostentatious life she leads paid for\nby her banker husband Hal Francis\n(Alec Baldwin). he other happens\nafter her husband is sent to prison\nfor fraud and Jasmine \ufb01nds that she\nis useless without him, or rather his\nmoney. She\u2019s then forced to move in\nwith her sister Chili (Cannavale) and\nlive modestly while she tries to get her\nold life back. Meanwhile, Chili has\ntrouble with her many relationships\n(something Imperial students will also\nhave trouble relating to).\nIt\u2019soneofWoodyAllen\u2019sbestabilities\nto make the audience identify with\na character who would normally be\noverly irritating. Impressively, he does\nthis here with every character. his\nestablishes an interesting problem\nfor the audience as we sympathise\nwith everyone despite the fact that\nthey all hate each other. Woody Allen\ndirects a good cast, but in this case\nit\u2019s his fantastic script that has to be\ncredited for establishing convincing\nrelationships between the \ufb01lm\u2019s many\ncharacters quickly enough that the\nstory keeps moving forward.\nBut the \ufb01lm\u2019s success lies squarely\non the strength of Cate Blanchett\u2019s\nperformance. She\u2019s vapid, elitist, and\nself-absorbed and it\u2019s these traits\nwhich make her entertaining to watch,\nbut they aren\u2019t so overpowering that\nit completely dehumanises her. In\nthe end we -maybe not like her- but\ntolerate her and want her to turn her\nlife around. It\u2019s this subtle balance\nwhich makes the \ufb01lm. here are times\nthough when the \ufb01lm feels like it is\nstuck and the characters\u2019 development\nisn\u2019t progressing, something that\u2019s\ncrucial in a \ufb01lm that\u2019s exclusively\nabout character development. Not\nthat the \ufb01lm is too long but a couple of\nscenes, particularly in the last third of\nthe \ufb01lm, could\u2019ve been cut.\nQuirky characters (like a loveable\nsound engineer played by the brilliant\nLouis C.K.), funny dialogue, upper\nclass white people drinking martinis...\nit\u2019s a very Woody Allen \ufb01lm, but it\u2019s\nalso accessible. After a very bumpy\nride with him over the past decade,\nhis fans will appreciate it as one of his\nrecent best though I fear that the level\nof his earlier work is sadly behind him\nnow. For someone who isn\u2019t familiar\nwith his work, this is a very good place\nto start.\n24 FRIDAY 04 OCT\n\n"

    "content": "9\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\nBUSINESS\nPushing for cheaper food and drink in pubs and restaurants!\nannum, there would be less under-reporting of cash receipts (\u2018Tax Gap\u2019)\nand as such higher income tax yields\nas a result of less under-reporting.\nhe question we must ask is:\nHow much will a reduction in VAT\ncost the economy?\nA reduction in VAT from 20% - 5%\nwould result is a direct loss of \u00a35.5\nbillion (excluding alcohol). However,\nthe research suggests that once the\nindirect gains from the reduction of\nVAT has been taken into account, the\nnet \ufb01scal cost would be between \u00a30.7\nand \u00a33.1 billion. he research also\nsuggests that the reduction in VAT\nwould create between 290,000 and\n670,000 jobs. An example of this was\nin early 2012, when President Nicolas\nSarkozy declared the VAT decrease\nhad saved 30,000 caf\u00e9s and restaurants\nthat were struggling \ufb01nancially.\nOne other sector which could\nbene\ufb01t enormously from the decrease\nin tax is hotel accommodation. As\nof January 1st 2012, 22 European\ncountries had a reduced rate of\nAxe VAT for the hospitality industry\nEditor: James Tsim\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow can reducing VAT help the\neconomy?\nWith high unemployment levels and\nincreasing difficulty in \ufb01nding jobs,\nthe job market in the UK along with\nthe economy needs boosting. One\nmethod suggested by the VAT club\nfounded by Jacques Borel is that a\nreduction in VAT would increase\nsales and employment, bringing\nlong term bene\ufb01ts to the economy.\nVAT (Value Added Tax) is the tax\non the purchase price of goods.\nhis is an indirect tax, which is\nenforced on all people regardless of\ntheir wealth; a poor person would\nbe taxed the same amount on a\nproduct as a rich person would be.\nAccording to Jacques Borel, one\nsector which would bene\ufb01t widely\nfrom reduced VAT is the hospitality\nsector. his particular sector mounts\nan incredibly strong argument for the\nreduction of VAT. he total number\nof jobs in the hospitality sector in the\nUK is approximately 2 million and the\nindustry is particularly important in\nproviding \ufb01nancial stability to young,\nunskilled, and disadvantaged workers.\nhe Association of Licensed Multiple\nRetailers job tracker research showed\nthat licensed hospitality created 1 in 6\njobs for 18-24 year olds. he expansion\nof this sector is relatively easy, with\npubs, bars, and cafes with low barriers\nof entry. Lower VAT rates would be\nable to stimulate the creation of new\nbusinesses and jobs in the sector.\nOn top of that, the VAT reduction\nwould lead to lower prices in food,\npossibly higher salaries for employees\nand better training, therefore\nincreasing the quality of service.\nAnother argument for the reduction\nof VAT for the hospitality sector\nis to keep it fair and in line with\nsupermarkets. Currently pubs and\nrestaurants pay 20% VAT on food\nand drinks, whilst supermarkets pay\n0% VAT. his has led to many people,\nespecially students deciding to eat\nin rather than out, meaning fewer\npeople supporting the on-trade and\nthe jobs created there. hey claim that\nit is not fair that supermarkets pay a\nfraction of the tax pubs pay per pint.\nHowever, a reduction in tax would\nlead to a direct decline in income for\nthe treasury via VAT receipts. Jacques\nBorel suggests however that this\ndi\ufb00erence would be made up for by\nhigher income tax, National Insurance\npayments, higher corporation tax\nreceipts, saving in unemployment\nbene\ufb01ts and through the fact that\nmore businesses will end up paying\ntax. his is because there will be less\nincentive for small businesses to stay\nbelow the tax threshold of \u00a377,000 per\nBusiness Editor\nJames Tsim\nVAT for hotel accommodation,\nwhile 13 countries had a reduced\nrate to caf\u00e9s, pubs, restaurants and\ncatering services. he cost of living in\nhotels is a danger to the UK tourism\nindustry and we must keep prices\ncompetitive with those abroad.\nIn order to bring this campaign\nto light, the VAT club organised a\nTax Parity Day. his was held on the\n25th September 2013, where over 44\nbusinesses (15,000 outlets) across the\ncountry took part in campaigning\nand participating in Tax Parity Day.\nhese included JD Weatherspoons\nand Punch Taverns. All businesses\n(40% restaurants, 60% pubs) which\ntook part in the event lowered their\nprices by 7.5% in support of a VAT cut.\nBorel claims \u201cIf we compare with what\nhas happened in Germany, Finland,\nBelgium and France, if you make a\n7.5% price cut, you will have 25% more\nclients, which is very signi\ufb01cant.\u201d\nBorel also says that 10,000 pubs have\nclosed and many others are su\ufb00ering\nthrough insufficient investment.\u201d\nhis project however has not had\nmuch reception by the treasury.\nIn short, we should all consider\nsupporting lower VAT for food and\ndrink in the hospitality industry, as\nthis promises to boost the size of\nthe industry whilst lowering the cost\nto us customers. So join supporters\nof this campaign such as Pret a\nManger, Weatherspoons, Subway,\nand TGI Fridays, Pizza Hut etc,\nand campaign for fair VAT rates.\nDeveloping your skills\nImperial Plus\nGet recognition for your volunteer achievements.

After\nwriting an exclusive guest editorial in\nan American newspaper the Hangman\ntook the liberty of inviting me to\ndiscuss the plans for the upcoming\nHomophobic Games that I\u2019m hosting\nin my domain. hat\u2019s right, I said it out\nloud, there\u2019s nothing you can do about\nit.\nhe theme for the Winter\nHomophobic Games 2014 is of course\nhatin\u2019 on people with sexuality I just\ncan\u2019t understand. Now don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I do enjoy a bit of Supermarket\nSweep and the Graham Norton Show\nis simply divine, however I strongly\nbelieve that we should make sure\nthat these people do not in\ufb02uence\nour children while they are growing\nup and developing. Instead I believe\nthe best policy is to give them strong\ngender roles to learn from, which is\none of the reasons I like to publish\nFirst black Felix Editor awarded Nobel Prize for Literature\nBUSINESS INSIDER\ntopless pictures of myself doing very\nstereotypical male things like riding\nhorses, chopping down trees and\n\ufb01shing.\nIn order to reinforce these\ngender stereotypes I plan to release\nnew pictures of my topless body\nsurrounded by other men dressed\nin the uniform of traditional male\nworkers, such as a police officer, a\ncowboy and of course a construction\nworker. In this way I plan to guide our\nchildren towards a more \u201cnormal\u201d\nperception of human sexuality.\nEventually our children will grow to\nunderstand to see a \u201charmless\u201d male\ncouple holding hands as dangerous\nwhile they will grow to look forward\nto seeing bigger and better pictures\nof me in various poses, occasionally\ncovered in oil.\nI also had the opportunity to come\nalong to the Freshers\u2019 Fair in your\ninstitution (I have to admit the name\nis fantastic, \u201cImperial\u201d presents a very\nstrong presence) and I was surprised\nto see some of my old Stonemason\nfriends.

Of course the next day once\nI realised that they had tricked me\ninto spending the evening with some\nactors they had hired I was annoyed,\nbut eventually I realised that they were\njust playing around, the ultimate Lads!\nIt is unfortunate that the female\nLode couldn\u2019t join us, but we still had\na lot of fun on our exciting adventures\naround London. Seeing them again\nmade me realise how much my life\nhas changed in the last 15 years since\nI stopped wearing my dungarees and\nstraw hat while going clubbing to\nthose specialist all-male clubs. It\u2019s a\nshame those times had to end, but it\u2019s\nall part of the experience I want for\nthe next generation: A strong sexual\nidentity and an ability have a lot of fun\nwith your peers, both in a physical and\nemotional sense produces mentally\nhealthy adults who are able to engage\nin ful\ufb01lling lives \ufb02avoured with the\ninsecurity and sense of unease that\nhas helped me become the person I\nam today.

To\nmy surprise, I had not heard of even\none of these games, but this is probably because I have never played a\nSimulator game before. I didn\u2019t know\ncodes and passwords, select a route\nand which direction you will drive it\nin, partake in the complex setup of\nturning on the engine and on board\ncircuitry, take the parking breaks o\ufb00,\nchange gear and drive o\ufb00\u2026 Sadly this\nis where I met my \ufb01rst di\ufb03culties. For\nhalf an hour I sat, refusing to open\nthe detailed 30 page pdf that comes\nwith the game. Why wouldn\u2019t my bus\ndrive o\ufb00? After all, I had completed\nthe in-game instructions, which currently told me to accelerate. I had a\nlook around my bus and eventually\nrealised the door was open. OK, I say,\nall I need to do is close the door, that\u2019s\nnum pad 1, which my laptop does not\nhave. So I change the binding to left\nclick as there seems no other key that\nisn\u2019t bound to a control in the bus.\nOnly later would I realise that whenever I clicked on a button in my bus\nthe doors would open. Nevertheless,\ndoors closed, I drive my bus away,\nwhich I have chosen to be a school\nbus. After driving around the German town I run into more di\ufb03culties.\nI can\u2019t seem to \ufb01nd any children or\nanyone in the game that will in fact\nget on my bus. his problem took\na signi\ufb01cant amount of time to \ufb01x;\nhowever, 2 hours into the game, and\nno longer a school bus, I was ready\nfor my \ufb01rst route as a bus driver.\nAs you might be able to tell, every\ndetail to do with the bus can be con-trolled, down to the air conditioning\nwhich needs careful control so the\nwindows don\u2019t fog up. I didn\u2019t know\nmuch about bus driving before this\ngame but I\u2019ve come away feeling edu-cated. Driving around my route and\npicking up passengers while wearing\nmy pyjamas (in real life), gives me a\nsense of achievement. European Bus\nSimulator is a relaxing game once you\nget the hang of it, but is not without\nsome pretty major faults. he \ufb01rst\nglaring mistake for me is that you can\nchoose your name, your age and your\ngender, but once the game starts my\ncharacter really doesn\u2019t strike me as a\n1 year old girl called Frank Schmidt.\nIn fact I look like a 40 year old man.\nWhile driving the bus I got points\no\ufb00 for being early, and also points\no\ufb00 later on for being delayed, but I\ndidn\u2019t get points o\ufb00 for running over\nmy passengers, driving on the wrong\nside of the road, \ufb02ipping over a car in\na pretty severe car crash, charging my\npassengers the wrong amount or giving no change from 20 Euros. I would\nhave thought a game which relies\non accurate simulation would have\npayed close attention to these details.\nAlso it\u2019s a German town and so all the\nconsole controls are in German, but\nall the passengers speak perfect English to me. Since when did German\npeople say \u201cGood Evening Sir\u201d? Since\nwhen were bus customers so polite?\nOverall all I can say is,\nit\u2019s been an experience.\nthat there was a demand for games\nsuch as Chemical Spillage Simulator, Stone Quarry Simulator or Truck\nSimulator. Keen to dive in to this new\nworld of Simulator games, I picked\nup European Bus Simulator 2012\nand began my educational journey.\nhe premise of European Bus Simulator is that you are a bus driver in a\nlarge German town. his game succeeds at being a Simulator as everything to do with the bus is very real-istic. You\u2019ll be required to walk over\nto it in the garage, type in your driver\nDazed, Mary decides to call the police after the bus driver refused to give her a ticket\nA low drone sounds. \u201cDadddy,\ndaddy, please don\u2019t kill me.\u201d\nChildren begin to sing and a\ngreat machine starts up. \u201cDaddy!\nDaddy!\u201d\u2026 You awake in your bed,\nand go o\ufb00 in search of your children.\nhus begins the 5-6 hour horror\nexperience that is Amnesia: A\nThis world is a Machine. A Machine for Pigs. Fit only for the slaughtering of Pigs.\nMachine for Pigs, an indirect sequel to\nFrictional Games he Dark Descent.\nAfter a short period in which you learn\nthe games only controls; crouching,\npicking up items, opening doors\nand running (which you will do if\ncrouching fails), you are immediately\nthrust into a world of terror. Unlike\nthe original this game is developed by\nhe Chinese Room (who previously\ndid Dear Esther). his is probably\nresponsible for the di\ufb00erence between\nthe two games. Many of my favourite\ngame mechanics from the original\nare not present in the new one. Even\nmechanics that I thought made he\nDark Descent the great game it is!\nA Machine for Pigs o\ufb00ers very little\nin terms of puzzles and gameplay.\nGone are he Dark Descent days of\nhaving to light candles, and \ufb01ll up\nyour lantern to keep your sanity levels\nup. Your inventory is gone, and now\nyou must carry around various items\nmuch like you would in Portal. You\ncan even use your lantern as much as\nyou want without worrying about it\nrunning out (although you will want\nto turn it o\ufb00 nearly as much as you\nwant it on!) A Machine for Pigs does\nnot satisfy my needs for another he\nDark Descent, but it does provide a\ngripping interactive horror story that\nwill keep you entertained, terri\ufb01ed\nand, at times, a little disgusted.\nhis game handles very smoothly,\nwhich is important for a game\nthat relies almost solely on you\nexperiencing the world. Everything\nfrom opening doors, to turning wheels\nand picking up fuses feels intuitive and\nsimple. here is even has controller\nsupport should you want to use it. he\nworld is as beautiful as it is horrifying\nwhich keeps you immersed and keeps\nyou with a feeling of unease. Not once\nin this game did I feel safe. I was always\nexpecting things to jump out at me but\nwas never ready for them when they\ndid. You will jump and more than once!\nNearly everything about this game is\nterrifying, down to the amazing music\nwhich suited the game perfectly. From\ncreepy orchestral music, to children\nsinging nursery rhymes, the organ in\nthe chapel and the sounds of the great\nmachine (which you spend most of the\ngame interacting with), it all adds to\nthe experience. hroughout the game\nyou travel through many locations;\nyour house, the attic, the roads of\nVictorian London, and then the meat\nprocessing factory that hides a terrible\nsecret as you descend into it and come\nto meet the machine. he story is told\nthrough voice acting, which is superb,\nand hidden diary entries which slowly\nilluminate you to the terrible things\nyou\u2019ve done but can\u2019t remember\u2026\nA Machine for Pigs is a very story\ndriven game. None of it is particularly\nhard gameplay wise, but when you\nare scared it\u2019s very easy to panic and\nmake mistakes. he story is excellent\nand alone is enough to make you\nwant to play on despite the challenge.\nFor one play through the price of\n\u00a312.99 is good, although I\u2019m sure\nmost people will play through it more\nthan once which makes the price\neven better. I would get this game\nif you are a fan of horror, and like\nthe idea of an interactive terrifying\nexperience. From a gameplay point\nof view, this game isn\u2019t challenging at\nall. If you are looking for a challenge\nI would recommend the original,\nwhich also has user made stories\nand the mini expansion Justine.\nI\u2019ve forgotten why I like Amnesia...\nCalum Skene\nGames Editor\nDid you brave Amnesia without\nscreaming?

    "content": "Editor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nMUSIC\nSimon Hunter reports on the band keeping Bob Marley\u02bcs legacy alive\nOn Monday night I spent the evening\nin the Millennium Dome and came to\nthe conclusion that it should be lev-elled. It may no longer be called the\nMillennium Dome and it may now\nhave an array of soulless bars/restau-rants, but the fact remains: it\u2019s a large\ntent with the character to match.\nhis was rather unfortunate as the\nWailers played here (in the IndigO2)\non Monday, and a band with such history really deserved a venue with a\nbit of soul. Last time I was at the IndigO2 I saw Westwood play about 30\nseconds of lots of songs at a student\nradio awards show. Continuing with\nthe bizarre range of musicians that\nthe venue attracts, both Hanson and\nChas & Dave are to grace the stage\nbefore Christmas.\nhe Wailers originated as the band\nbehind Bob Marley but over the decades the band has morphed, with only\nthe bassist, Aston Barrett, remaining\nfrom the original line-up. his isn\u2019t\nnecessarily a bad thing; there\u2019s little\nmore awkward than watching a gang\nof septuagenarians holding themselves up with mic stands while crooning breathlessly.\nWe arrived in time to catch the last\nfew chords of the support act and take\nour place at the bar. Unfortunately,\nour spot prevented any sight of Barrett, or \u2018king of the reggae bassline\u2019 as\nwe were frequently reminded by Bob\nMarley\u2019s 2013 replacement. On the\nplus side, we had a great view of the\naudience. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been\nto a gig with such a range of ages in\nthe audience; a testament, I suppose,\nto Marley\u2019s music. Having said this,\nthe median age\nupstairs where\nthe seats are located was de\ufb01nitely somewhere north of\n50.\nhe show\nstarted slowly\nwith renditions\nof Is his Love\nand No Woman, No Cry. It\nwasn\u2019t until\nthe bassline of\nCould You Be Loved\nsprung from Barrett\u2019s\nguitar that the crowd\nbegan to rise from\ntheir seats. Up stood\na girl, dancing away\nbut watching the show\nthrough an iPad that\nwas held 5 inches from\nher face. However, at\nleast when she occasionally put the thing\ndown she knew how to\ndance.\nBy half way through\nthe show, most people\nwere on their feet. At\nleast, the people round\nthe edges were. hose\nthat had obviously\nbeen online, hammering F5, when tickets\nwent available and had\nbagged themselves\nnice, central seats didn\u2019t budge for the\nentire show. Bizarrely, it seemed that\na cross-section of the most rhythmically challenged people in London had\ndecided to turn out. From a lady who\nlooked to be undergoing some kind of\nvertical electric shock treatment, to a\nguy who was \ufb02ailing about like it was\n3am in TigerTiger. iPad girl, they were\nnot. But who am I to judge? hey were\nloving it.\nRegardless of what you think of reggae music, it\u2019s impossible not to \ufb01nd\nit infectious. Bu\ufb00alo Soldier had me\nbouncing along, but the highlight of\nthe night really was the encore. here\nwas an energy in those last few songs\nthat for some reason didn\u2019t seem to\npervade the rest of the performance.\nExodus and Punky Reggae Party were\nparticularly good. A mention should\nalso go to Cegee Victory, the female\nvocalist who added some beautiful\nharmonies to the songs, but who I\nthought should have been used more,\nsuch were her obvious vocal talents.\nI still believe that the IndigO2 isn\u2019t a\ngreat venue for the Wailers. he level\nof corporate bullshit that comes hand-in-hand with the O2 seems to detract\nsomewhat from what Bob Marley and\nhis music stands for. However, at the\nend of the day, it may be what is needed when a large proportion of their\nfans now prefer a comfortable seat\nover a beer and a blunt.\nA Punky Reggae Party\nThe Wailers, including original member Aston Barrett (front).\nOn tour with the National Youth Choir\nI spent the \ufb01rst two-and-a-half weeks\nofAugustsinging.Well,notconstantly,\nbut almost. Now, this was not just a\nvery long rave, although I certainly\ndid have a lot of fun. No, this was\nperfectionist music making with the\nNational Youth Choir (\u2018NYC\u2019 amongst\nfriends) where singing a note with the\nwrong vowel placement was just as\nbad as singing the wrong note. I have\nbeen involved in this organisation for\na long time now, but what was special\nabout this course is that it was truly\nnational. During our 19 days together\nas a choir of about a hundred, we\nexplored York, Londonderry, Belfast,\nLondon, Cardi\ufb00, Edinburgh and\nSu\ufb00olk, performing in seven concerts.\nFor our \ufb01rst few concerts, we\ncombined forces with a couple of\nIrish choirs and the National Youth\nOrchestratoperformthemonumental\nBeethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony and\nthe slightly-easier-to-sing Toward\nthe Unknown Region by Vaughan\nWilliams. We performed these\nboth in Northern Ireland and in the\nBBC Proms at a packed Albert Hall.\nIf these concerts were characterised\nby their energy and excitement, the\nnext few concerts were all about\nintimacy and blend. Without the\nIrish choirs and with no orchestra, we\nwere a much smaller group and we\nset about achieving our characteristic\n\u2018NYC sound\u2019. his abstract concept\nis one we are always trying to chase\nand we literally spend hours trying\nto reach this goal. It is not unknown\nfor us to spend an hour or so just\nworking on a couple of lines of music,\nbut at the end it really is transformed.\nhere was a lot of work, but plenty\nof play too. I recall with fondness a\ngreat evening at a funfair in Cardi\ufb00\nbay. Banter was abundant, both in\nour free time and in rehearsals, and\nthere were far too many in-jokes\nto keep up with. I have no doubt\nthat I shall remember the great\ntime I had for many years to come.\n\u201cWant to write for music?\nemail us at music.felix@\ngmail.com with a review\nand we\u02bcll get in contact!\u201d\nDaniel Marx\nMusic Writer\nThe NYC singing during the Royal Albert Hall\u02bcs summer Proms\n19\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nEditor: Kartikeya\nRana\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 FRIDAY 04 OCT\nhe non-essential services provided\nby the US government have grinded\nto a halt as there is disagreement in\nCongress about the current budget.\nhis not only weakens the country\n\ufb01nancially but also shows the inefficiency US congress has to deliberate\nand compromise in situations where\nideologies clash.\nhe main cause of the budget not\nbeing passed is Obama\u2019s new health\ncare reform which has been abbreviated to \u2018Obamacare\u2019. he official name\nof this reform is Patient Protection\nand the Affordable Care Act. he act\nis designed to give those Americans\nwho are not covered by private health\ninsurance coverage. By doing so, the\ngovernment plans to prevent malpractices of various insurance companies.\nhe plan is also meant to provide coverage that could not be provided with\nprivately bought health insurance.\nhese include plans to provide yearly\ncheck-ups and maternity care. People\nwho are part of Medicaid (poor and\ndisabled) have added bene\ufb01ts from\nthis law. Anyone earning less than\n31,000$ per year receives free Medicaid.\nHowever, people who do not qualify\nfor Medicare (senior citizens) and\nMedicaid, and don\u2019t have private insurance have to pay for Obamacare.\nhis is the part of the reform which\nhad to be passed through the 2013-2014 \ufb01nancial year budget. Even then,\n20 million people will not be covered\nas the law exempts those who are in-carcerated, who belong to certain religious groups, illegal immigrants and\nthose who are willing to pay the penalty for not subscribing.\nWhy are the Republicans against Obamacare?\nhe opposition has given a number of\nreasons as to why they are against this\nnew Law. Firstly, they believe that the\npassing of the bill will increase health\ncare spending for the government.\nhis will mainly be caused by the coverage provided for the poorest 18 %.\nFurthermore, they believe that it is\nnot right for the government to force\npeople to subscribe to something that\nthey may not particularly want.\nHowever, supporters of Obamacare\nstate that the Republicans are opposed\nto it because they fear that it may actually work. he people who bene\ufb01t\nthe most from Obamacare belong to\nred states such as Texas.\nAs a result, the opposition has shown\nserious outrage towards the budget\nand has prevented it from passing\nthrough the Senate. Since the deadline\nfor passing the budget was missed, the\ngovernment has been put through a\npartial shutdown as per the American constitution. his has resulted in\nvarious non essential services being\nclosed. hese include museums and\nnational parks.\nAn estimated 700,000 people will face\nunpaid leave if a compromise is not\nmet on the budget. Senior officers of\nAmerican spy agencies have shown\nsome fear due to this shutdown.\nAbout 70% of intelligence workers will\nlose their jobs. his will cause, they\nbelieve, a grave danger to American\nnational security.\nPresident Obama can decide on a\n\u2018stopgap\u2019 budget to prevent such a\nshutdown from taking place. his will\nbe a one-week spending bill which\nwill allow the non-essential services to\nfunction. However, he refused to go\nwith this proposal when he stated that\nthe \u2018stopgap\u2019 budget will only delay the\ninevitable \ufb01ghting.\nhis shutdown not only a\ufb00ects the US\nbut also the international community\nas a whole. As a result of globalisation,\neconomic problems faced by the US\nhas had the tendency to cause trouble elsewhere as well. A lot of countries have shown fear as a result of the\nshutdown.\nMy take:\nI am disgusted to see how the US congress has dealt with the budget. Just\nbecause of an ideological standpoint,\ncongressmen seem to be ready to allow a large part of their population\nto be rendered jobless. I don\u2019t believe\nthat the Republican Party has provided any concrete reasons to be fuming about the health care reforms. If\nthey feel that the scheme will cost too\nmuch, they should provide with e\ufb00ective measures to reduce such costs.\nAsking for a further delay on this is-sue, however, is simply a means to\nprevent a solution. hey already had\na year to provide e\ufb00ective alternatives\nto the so called- \u2018high cost measures\u2019\nbut decided not to provide them.\nA devastating attack in a shopping\nmall in Nairobi took place on the 23rd\nof September. Gunmen killed 67 peo-ple, according to government sources\n, in the Westgate Mall. hese militants\nwere said to belong to the extremist\ngroup originating from Somalia called\nAl Shabbab.\nBut who are these peddlers of terror?\nhe Al Shabbab is the political wing of\nthe Somali Council of Islamic Courts,\nwhich took over much of Somalia in\n2006. he government and other interim forces eventually defeated these\nforces but the group still remained as a\nterrorist force. hey have planned and\nsuccessfully executed various insurgent and other suicide attacks.\nAccording to various sources, they\nrecruit people, sometimes forcibly,\nto take part in these terrorist attacks.\nSome claim that young men are forced\nby circumstances to join this group to\nconduct their operations rather than\nbecause of an ideological support.\nhe Al Shabbab is more nationalistic in nature than other terrorist or-ganisations. hey tend to have most\nof their operations against the TFG\n(Transitional Federal Government of\nSomalia). he Al Shabbab has bitter\nsentiments against the KDF (Kenyan\nDefence Forces) for being present in\nSomalia. his animosity has led them\nto attack innocent civilians in Nairobi.\nIn fact, they have promised to intensify their attacks in Kenya if the KDF\ndoes not budge from Somalia. \u201chere\nwill be pools of blood\u201d, one spokesperson for the Al Shabbab stated.

    "content": "29\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Yong Wen Chua\ntechnology.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\nTECHNOLOGY\nMax Eggl ruminates on the repercussion of our device addiction\nhis is a very interesting question\nI found myself talking about with\na friend recently. Is technology\nreally making us weaker, mentally\nand physically? If you consider that\ntechnology is part of the human\ncondition, then you would disagree\nand I would be on your side. All the\nbrilliant things that humans have\ninvented really do make everything\nbetter (or do they? Sorry just had to\nput that clich\u00e9 in). However if we only\nconsider the human as the biological\nentity that makes him, is there a\ndi\ufb00erent story?\nAnytime new technology has come\nalong, it has eased the segment of lives\nit a\ufb00ects, otherwise it would not really\nhave been invented. hrough making\npretty much everything easier and\ndoable, some people say that it has\nexpanded the human border as well\nas enhanced the every day persons\ncapabilities. Airplanes and cars have\nrevolutionised travel, Internet has\nchanged the way we communicate\nand exchange information and\ntablets have changed the way we\ninteract with media. hese are just\na few examples of how certain areas\nthat are a fundamental part of the\naverage human life have been a\ufb00ected\nradically. In fact most of these e\ufb00ects\nhave been very positive, giving us\nthe possibilities to travel, talk and\ndo things that would not have been\npossible in such scale even 50 years\nago.\nhe big question I always have in\nmind though is that, has technology\non its own made the human being\nfundamentally weaker, more\ndependent on the devices and\nmachines that surround them?\nProbably one of the most obvious\nones is probably the e\ufb00ect that cars\nhave had on the human body on\nthe whole. here have been some\ninteresting studies that seem to show\na link between driving and obesity.\nOverlaying a map of obese adults\nin the US as well as the map of the\npercentage of commuters that drive,\nshows some striking trends. Is it\nthen that perhaps due to the ease and\nspeed of driving a car, that exercise\n(e.g. biking, walking) is shunned and\nthis leads to a negative impact on the\nhuman body? I think that most of\nyou would agree. However driving\ncannot be solely credited with causing\nobesity. Other factors also often\nlinked with obesity like eating habits\nand lifestyle. However there also other\ntechnology factors that I could have\nmentioned instead, which would have\nshown similar trends!\nGiven that nomophobia, a now\nrecognised phobia that can lead to\nstress and anxiety in those that are\nwithout their phones, was prevalent in\nroughly half the population sampled\nby YouGov, implies a interesting\ntrend, since the smartphone as such\nonly really exists only about 10 years.\nhe smartphone has become such a\nuseful appendage that, even though\nit really does not add anything new to\nour lives, the lack of it is very apparent.\nAnother interesting aspect of the\nsmartphone with respect to our\ndependency on tech and perceived\nresulting weakness is related to how\neasily everything is accessible from\nliterally everywhere. Some studies\nclaim to show that this leads to a\nlower attention span. When you have\ninstant access to anything you want,\ngames, blogs, facebook pro\ufb01les etc., as\nwell as it being short and snappy, then\nwhen you really have to concentrate\non something that may not be done\nin a similar manner may be very o\ufb00\nputting.\nhe last thing I would like to point\nout is the e\ufb00ect that the internet,\nand its easy sharing has had on our\ncommunication skills. Firstly, due\nto a rise of text speak, which I know\nall of us use, this current generation\nis more accustomed to using these\nabbreviations than the correct\nEnglish. I have stopped counting how\nmany times I actually had to correct\nmy \u201cyou\u2019s\u201d from \u201cu\u2019s\u201d in proper emails\netc. . Maybe this is just the evolution\nof the English language, but it does\nseem to be leading to a weakening\nof the beautiful vocabulary that each\nlanguage possesses. Another aspect of\nbeing on the internet permanently, is\nthe fact that avoiding confrontations,\nis so much easier. If you want to escape\na \ufb01ght you just leave the site. his\ncan lead to an erosion of real con\ufb02ict\nThe crippling effect of Technology\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nTechnology Editors\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, BlackBerry has \ufb01nally bitten to\nthe bullet to the glee of this editor.

Overall, it was a\nstrong showing from the team, with\nImperial 2 topping their group and\nsecuring their progression to the\nknock-out stages. Undoubtedly the\nstar of the weekend though was Mr\nSpeller who reached the semi-\ufb01nals\nof the Individual Championship\nonly to be beaten by the eventual\nrunner-up, Jin Foulger (Exeter 1).\nMany of these star performers will\nbe returning for the coming season\nso the team can take great con\ufb01dence\ninto next season\u2019s competitions!\nhe same month brought a trip to a\nbitterly cold Great Yarmouth with the\nVauxhall Holiday Park providing both\nthe venue and accommodation for the\n8-ball team competing in the BUCS\n8-ball English Pool Championships.\nhis proved to be a surprise-\ufb01lled\nweekend with the narrative of the\ntournament dominated by missed\nclearances, tactical errors and pot\nluck. When the tale of the tournament\nwas \ufb01nally told, Imperial had narrowly\nmissed out on a place in the knock-out\nstages of the Team Shield, \ufb01nishing 3rd\nin their group. However, a young side\nwith a much improved performance\nfrom the previous season gained\ninvaluable experience in the BUCS\nformat. For the guys involved, it was\nan unforgettable experience (although\nnot necessarily for the right reasons!)\n\ufb01lled with great banter. his proved to\nbe a necessity to survive the freezing\ncold caravans, as most of the team\ncozied together by the warm \ufb01re in\nthe living room, while only the elder\nstatesman of the club, Elwin Carlos,\nbraved the unheated bedroom!\nOnto an enthralling weekend\nin Leeds for BUCS Snooker\nChampionships where Max Chalmers,\nmaking his snooker debut for Imperial\n2, had the longest run of all Imperial\nplayers in the individual event.

As a group of keen run-ners, we naturally considered jogging\nthere, but soon decided to travel the\n240 miles by minibus instead. he\nvan, e\ufb00ortlessly navigated and driven\nby Matt Douthwaite, was loaded up\nwith trainers, sports bags, games and\ntwenty odd obligatory contributions\nof home baked goods.\nUpon arrival we were welcomed by a\nspacious, seven bedroom house; with\ntwo sitting rooms and two kitchens,\nattached to a backyard with a terrace,\na lawn and a pond. Not to mention the\npool, optimal for resistance training\nand the hot tub, ideal for muscle re-covery. All this and only minutes away\nfrom coastal running paths!\nAlthough the focus throughout the\nweek lay with running, we had many\nactivities unrelated to XC on o\ufb00er\ntoo. Everyone was keen to contribute\nin whatever way they could to \ufb01ll our\ntime with fun and new experiences.\nVicki Solly held an introductory yoga\nclass, in which she had us bending\nand stretching in ways previously unknown to many of us. As relaxing as it\nwas at the time, this session left most\nof the participants sorer than after the\n12 km run from the previous day -proving to all sceptics that yoga is not\njust posing as a sport.\nJames Ellis conducted hill reps and\nAlwyn Elliot taught some basic Kung\nFu, as well as the vital skill of lighting a\nlog \ufb01re. Sophie Kirk planned the dinner menu for each day of the week and\nit goes without saying that we were\nvery well fed!\nIt is always fantastic to see the level\nof commitment and enthusiasm that\ngoes into a club tour. Cross Country\nand Athletics captain Chris Bannon,\nwho was unable to run, came along regardless of his injury and his upcoming exams. Harriet Nerva and Antoinette Hardijzer, both also had other\nimportant commitments that week,\nbut didn\u2019t want to miss all of tour and\nso ended up staying for half the time.\nDespite having to make their way back\non their own, they are both insistent\nthat the long train journey was worth\nit!\nhere was so much hype about this\ntour, we even had triathlon committee\nmembers, Si\u00e2n Morgan and Ed Hallet,\njoin us. Peter Spence also deserves a\nspecial mention here.\nAs our designated cameraman, he\nwas bold enough to take his camera\neverywhere we went and even faced\nruns along the steep, rocky coastal\npaths, with only one free hand.\nHowever we witnessed another type\nof commitment on tour too, namely\nthe commitment to the sport. While\nthe rest of us were playing beach vol-leyball; or in the case of Richard Bennett, who was merrily letting himself\nbe buried in the sand, Liam Smith was\nengaging in interval training alongside the water. Similarly while some\nof us were having a lie in and recovering from a late night, Laurence Tse\nand Matthias Knop were already tying\nup their trainers and getting ready to\nhead out on a morning run.\nIn total six out of the twenty two\ntour participants were freshmen. Andreas Ekholm and Duncan Ingram\nboth joined XC&A at the start of autumn term 2012. Equally Harveen\nHayer, Oliver Ashe and I joined at this\ntime and have now all taken on committee positions. his goes to show\nhow quickly one feels integrated in\nthe club and just how welcoming the\nmembers of XC&A are! Having said all\nthis, it would be great to see some new\nfaces at our runs.

    "content": "CAREERS Editors: VACANT\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n36 FRIDAY 04 OCT\nIAESTE - A journey without a\nI\nt was something as innocuous\nas an online search where I\ndiscovered the International\nAssociation for the Exchange of\nStudents for Technical Experience\n- or IAESTE (eye\u2219ee\u2219es\u2219ta) \u2013during\nmy second year reading Chemistry at\nImperial College London. I\u2019d already\nconsidered a number of similar\nschemes, all o\ufb00ering undergrads\nthe opportunity to work abroad\nfor 6-12 weeks during the summer\n(sometimes a year) with full pay,\nbut often only in business, language\nassistance, the tourism industry or\nwith some other caveat or restriction.\nIAESTE on the other hand, which\nis run by the British Council in the\nUK (the same folks who manage the\nwell-known ERASMUS) is focused\non science, technology and applied\narts placements i.e. exactly the kind\nof work experience that is relevant to\nme. IAESTE has been running for 65\nyears, operates in over 80 countries\nand organises more than 4,000 student\ninternships every year at over 1,500\ncompanies and institutions globally.\nManyoftheseorganisationsareleading\nuniversities and industrial \ufb01rms.\nFast forward a year, my plane is\ndeparting from Copenhagen airport\nand my eyes are glazed over thinking\nabout the summer I\u2019ve just had. Two\nmonths earlier I had started at the\nDanish Technical University (DTU).\nMy project concerned molecular\nmodeling of the energetics of the\ninteraction between an enzyme and\na variety of lipid substrates. It was\nmy \ufb01rst exposure to working in a\nresearch group, to interdisciplinary\ncollaboration and to the challenges\nposed by approaching a new\nresearch \ufb01eld. It introduced me to\nComputational Chemistry, a \ufb01eld\nthat I knew little about. I had the\nopportunity to compare the British\nuniversity system with the Danish\none, to converse with local PhD\nstudents about their motivation and\nambitions and to make friends with\nstudents from around the world.\nMy accommodation was in the\nuniversity student halls, which were\nconveniently located on campus. I\nwas surprised to \ufb01nd that Danish\nhalls of residence provided every\nkitchen utensil that a professional\nchef could dream of. And that all\nstudents enjoyed en suite rooms\nfor a very reasonable price.\nOne of the biggest challenges of\nliving abroad is the isolation one\ncan face upon arrival. I was certainly\ndisheartened during my \ufb01rst couple\nof days and I experienced culture\nshock, but it was a challenge that\nIAESTE helped me to overcome.\nhe Danish and UK IAESTE o\ufb03cers\nwere on hand for any occurrence\nand every other international trainee\nin Copenhagen was only alone for as\nlong as it took to discover one another.\nIn each major IAESTE city there\nis a Local Committee (LC) made up\nof local students, typically IAESTE\nalumni, and Copenhagen was no\ndi\ufb00erent. Every Tuesday the DTU\nLC organised a social event for the\n20 international trainees to mingle\nand meet with local students. Each\nweekend involved a Danish-inspired\nactivity, ranging from a stroll through\nthe capital, making the most of the\n\ufb02at landscape to cycle or visiting the\nmuseums around town. he rain\nnever stopped us from attending the\nmany festivals which Copenhagen is\nfamous for: we listened to everything\nfrom live jazz to punk-rock beats,\nlearned how to dance to the rhythm\nof salsa and stood silently before the\nbeauty of the moonlit Kronborg castle.\nhe person that landed back in\nLondon was not the same one who had\nleft eight weeks earlier. his person\nhad a newfound understanding of\nother cultures, a clearer idea of the\npath they wanted their academic\ncareer to take and the knowledge\nthat IAESTE could o\ufb00er even more.\nMy experience was unique, yet not\nsingular. I discovered that a group of\nlike-minded IAESTE alumni were\nsetting up a Local Committee in my\nvery own city. he group shared the\nsame IAESTE spirit and I\u2019ve since\nfound myself carried away by the\nambitious project of setting up the\ngroup in London, expanding it in\nsize and endeavoring to instill the\nsame IAESTE passion in UK students\nand those international trainees\nlucky enough to land on our shores.\nIf you\u2019re interested in experiencing\na new culture and applying yourself,\nthen look out for us at your next\ncareer\u2019s fair or on our website. During\nthe autumn term we allow students to\nregister their interest on our website\nbefore the December 10th deadline.\nhen in February, we contact those\nwho have registered with a list of\navailable overseas job placements,\nand applicants submit a complete,\nformal application including CV and\nreferences. Finally, those who succeed\nin their application are helped with\nany visa, travel and accommodation\nissues and given pre-departure\ntraining prior to their placements.\nLocal Committee: an experience\nworth a thousand internships\nI like to refer to my involvement\nas a volunteer in the London Local\nCommittee as my IAESTE Plus\nexperience. My internship was the\ntip of the iceberg; the organisation\nitself holds an enormous amount of\npotential for a person. he scope of the\nLC is wide-ranging. Our immediate\nrole is as an \u2018on-the-ground\u2019 outpost\nof the British Council IAESTE\no\ufb03ce, being the faces and smiles of\nIAESTE in welcoming new students\nand preparing those who are leaving\nto go abroad. During the summer,\nwe take care of the international\ntrainees resident in the UK, arranging\nsummer trips, weekly socials and\ncultural events. For the remainder\nof the year, you\u2019ll \ufb01nd us at careers\nfairs promoting IAESTE, networking\nwith employers and institutions\ntrying to secure new placement\nopportunities and working in\ncollaboration with the British Council.\nJoining the LC is a \ufb02exible\ncommitment. A big reason to be a\npart of it is that committed members\nare rewarded with a guaranteed\nIAESTE internship the following\nsummer, which is signi\ufb01cant given\nhow competitive securing placements\ncan be. However, the majority of our\nmembers are drawn to the LC simply\nbecause the experience is fun: besides\nbeingrewarding,thespiritofthegroup\n\u2013the\u201cIAESTEspirit\u201d\u2013isopenlysocial.\nLast year the London LC organized\nexchange trips (\u201ctwinnings\u201d) with\nIstanbul, Zagreb and Split; we held\nbarbecues, a New Year\u2019s Eve party, a\nChristmas dinner, attended festivals\nand concerts and many more events.\nThe LC is \ufb01rst and foremost a group\nof friends that is open to everyone.\nWhat\u2019s more, the London LC is an\ninternational organization. It has a\nworldwide reputation and is proud\nto attract members from other LCs\nglobally, giving all of its members\nendless opportunities to experience\ndi\ufb00erent cultures, to challenge\nstereotypes and to obtain \ufb01rst-hand\nglobal experience. his results in an\nLC that is dynamic, rich in perspective\nand ideas and a skills-enhancing,\ninternational working environment.\nBuilding a network, building skills\nPart of the package that comes with\nLC involvement is the gargantuan\nnumber of international contacts\nthat one builds: from peer students\nacross many disciplines to IAESTE\nalumni that are now leaders in\ntechnical and non-technical \ufb01elds;\nfrom the British Council sta\ufb00 to\nmany academics and industrial\nemployers around the globe. We\nspeak to people, we work with them,\nwe exchange ideas and build trust.\nOn top of that, those of us involved\nin raising placement opportunities\ngain valuable experience in selling\nIAESTE to potential employers.\nIn the London LC we are heavily\ncommitted to improving the skills of\nour members. A training weekend is\nheld in October annually, introducing\nattendees to the organisation of\nIAESTE and the London LC and\nteaching them how to communicate\nwith employers. Moreover, we\nfund our members\u2019 attendance at\ninternational seminars throughout the\nyear \u2013 last April we were in beautiful\nsnowy Oslo courtesy of the Norwegian\nIAESTE team and in September we\u2019ll\nbe sunning ourselves in Malta. Aside\nfrom the fun, cultural activities that\nthese trips involve, their purpose is\nalso to instruct attendees on how the\ninternational organisation IAESTE is\nrun and to help foster international\nrelations. Upon returning from\nthese seminars, members are highly\nenergized and ready to get hands-on\nexperience building IT platforms,\npromoting, marketing and raising\nplacements in a time and cost-e\ufb00ective\nmanner, organizing large events,\nbudgeting, recruiting and selecting a\nstrong team of volunteers and so on.\nhe LC is a volunteer-led\norganisation that is run professionally,\nrequiring a talented team comprising\na number of di\ufb00erent skillsets. Being\npart of the LC leads to numerous\nchances to practice public speaking\nand presentation skills, it teaches\nhow to report and to draw statistics\nbased on one\u2019s actions, how to\naccount for expenses and to plan\na budget. he LC uses modern IT\nsystems to exchange information,\nplan meetings, keep records and\nto communicate transparently.\nBeing a member of the LC isn\u2019t\njust about improving your internship\nchances or \ufb02eshing out your CV, we\nare an ambitious group that does\nreal work that shapes our members\nand their futures.

You will be surprised\nby how much fresh vegetables and\nfruits this is. Apart from the expected\nEnglish strawberries, raspberries,\nblueberries, plums, apples and pears,\nthere are also Downland Pigs famous\nfree range hog roast, Brambletye\nFarm\u2019s organic eggs and sweet and\nsavoury goodies from Queen of\nCakes. None of which you will be able\nto get from your local Sainsbury\u2019s.\nAndwithmygoodiesfromthemarket\nI made something special for dinner:\nPan-seared Pigeon Breast with\nStuffed Courgette Flowers and\nOven Roasted Potatoes\nIt\u2019s simple, yet it looks restaurant-level gourmet due to the not-quite-common ingredients - you get\namazing \ufb02avours and a mix of colour.\nYou also get to experiment a bit with\npretty che\ufb00y techniques, so this recipe\nis perfect for those who\u2019ve never tried\nstu\ufb00 like deglazing pans to make gravy,\netc. We\u2019re in-between seasons at the\nmoment, so sadly courgette \ufb02owers\nare sort of on their way out (they\u2019re\na summer thing) - but gamey pigeon\nbreastisperfectfortheautumn/winter.\nhe beauty of this dish is its\n\ufb02exibility - there are no food police!\nIf you can\u2019t \ufb01nd courgette \ufb02owers,\nsub with your own veggies (preferably\nthe stu\ufb00 that\u2019s more in season) -no need to pan-fry with egg wash\nnecessarily. Or for something just as\nimpressive, blackberry and game are\nknown to go quite well together so\nyou can toss blackberries and salad\nleaves, dress, and serve with this\ndish. Adjust amounts for a starter or\nmain, tweak it to make as \ufb01lling or\nas light as you want depending on\nhow in-between-seasons you feel.\nIngredients\n2 potatoes\n4 small pigeon breasts\n4 courgette \ufb02owers\n1 egg, beaten\nPlain \ufb02our for egg wash\nA tart berry jam (we used IKEA\u2019s\nLingonberry, but raspberry works)\n\u00bd ball mozzarella\nRed wine for gravy\nSalt and pepper to season\nPreheat your oven to 200 degrees\nCelsius, popping a tray of olive oil\nin to heat through. Peel and dice\nthe potatoes into medium chunks,\nthen parboil in salted water to give a\nheadstart on cooking, but not until\nfully tender. Drain and toss with\nthe heated oil + desired seasoning\non your tray to give a nice light\ncoating, then return to the oven.\nWhile waiting, lightly season the\npigeon breasts with salt and pepper,\nthen place skin side down on a hot pan\nandcookforafewminutes.Don\u2019tmove\nit about after it \ufb01rst makes contact\nwith the pan; you want it to develop a\nnice sear and colour. Like duck breast,\npigeon should not be cooked to death/\ngreyness - you still want it pinkish, and\nit\u2019s not going to take long. Turn over\nafter a few minutes and cook the other\nside in the same way, then remove\nfrom pan and let rest on a plate.\nDeglaze the pan with a splash of\nred wine, then add a bit of the\nlingonberry/raspberry jam and stir\nuntil well combined. Continue to\nheat on medium until it reduces,\nadding some of the resting juices from\nthe pigeon breast midway through\n(you\u2019ll see them seep out - just throw\nthem back into the pan.) You want\nthe gravy to be a bit tart and thick,\nso adjust jam amounts with care.\nWhile your gravy slowly reduces,\nrinse and dry the courgette \ufb02owers.\nCut up your mozzarella ball and stu\ufb00,\nthen dip in beaten egg wash, drip o\ufb00\nany excess and dust with seasoned\n\ufb02our (it\u2019s easy - just mix plain \ufb02our\nwith salt and pepper.) Heat a second\npan with a bit of oil and pan-fry the\ncourgette \ufb02owers until the coating\nis golden brown. Cheese should be\nheated through and somewhat melty-ish, but don\u2019t cook these veggies to\ndeath! Remove and arrange on plate.\nBy this time the potatoes should be\nready as well - you should time the\ncourgette \ufb02owers to be cooked a few\nminutes before the potatoes are done.\nhe sauce should have su\ufb03ciently\nreduced as well, so turn o\ufb00 the oven\nand the stove, take everything out\nand just plate up - then tuck in!\nWith special thanks to Wild Country\nOrganics for providing the courgette\nflowers. Pigeon meat from the South\nDowns Venison and Game stall.\nBloomsbury Marina O Connell talking to customers at the stall.

Highlights of this\nmatch include Gandal\ufb01ano \u201cgrinding down his opponent, until he was\nin an utter desperate and hopeless\nmess\u201d; Sporter coming from completely lost with a few pawns down,\nto swindling himself up a rook and\nwinning the game in the end and Luke\nbeating his opponent in 18 moves,\nsaying: \u2018she basically couldn\u2019t play\u2019.\nhe general consensus after the\ngame was that we had been domi-nating, and in fact should have won\npretty much on all boards. his conclusion and the fact that we were\nnow North Atlantic Chess champions allowed us a heightened sense\nof achievement and were looking\nforward to our next opponents.\nSince our game took quite a bit of\ntime we arrived returned rather late\nto Princeton and missed out on their\nclub night! However this was no big-gie, as we would be meeting them the\nnext day in the match that was billed\nas the one to end all Chess problems.\nAfter a good night\u2019s rest, and a hoagie (an absolutely better version of\na subway sandwich) we were ready\nto play Princeton. However it seems\nwe became overcon\ufb01dent. Losing\nsomething embarrassing like 12-6\nover two matches, we were quite\ndown after this episode. When asked\nabout their games Baron Luke re-marked: \u201cNot enough time to press\nhome an attack against the \u2018thug\nlyfe\u2019 \u201d and Adi attributed his loss\nto \u201che women\u2019s charm\u201d... ohh Adi!\nHowever we quickly had to prepare\nourselves for a bigger loss, because it\nwas time not only to leave Princeton,\nbut also to give up the Knight Rider.\nOur big baby couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t \ufb01t\ninto the New York parking spots, and\nso with some reluctance we gave the\nKnight Rider back to Hertz, and then\nmade our way to Columbia University, for our second stage of the tour.\nVery well organised and friendly,\nwe were met by Matthew, the Columbia Chess President, at the Columbia\nss Takes the Americas by storm\neros\u02bc campaign in the land of Freedom. Ah, \u02bbMurica\nCafe, and then were split up once\nagain. he Guptas (El Presidente and\nAdi) stayed together, and the rest all\nslept in Matthew\u2019s Dorm. Before we\nhit the hay, we had a pretty amazing time chilling and playing Chess.\nhe \ufb01rst thing on the agenda on the\nnext day was waiting for the Guptas\nto \ufb01nally wake up. Once they did we\nhad a very enjoyable breakfast consisting of pizza provided by Columbia before we commenced our game\nwith two time Ivy League champions\nColumbia. Sadly we lost 7-2 yet, however given the nature of the games, we\ncan say we actually did rather well. I\nmyself was playing a much higher\nrated player, and, until I started having time problems had him very\nwell contained. All our resident FM\nwould say though is: \u201cBanter right...?\u201d,\nwhich pretty much sums up his game.\nAfter this somewhat disappointing loss, where the result belied the\nactual performances, we rushed over\nto Washington Square to play NYU.\nHowever on the train, Sporter got\na message that they could not get a\nteam together, and thus conceded\ndefeat against the superior British\nopposition! In actuality this was a\nblessing in disguise as we were still\nknackered from the previous match\nso we made our way to Times Square\nto do some good-old fashioned site\nseeing! Congratulations should go\nto Alex and Luke for remaining unbeaten throughout the whole tour.\nTimes Square, while very impres-sive, was extremely packed for some\nfestival, so after a quick stroll and peak\naround the area we decided to vacate it\nand look at other things. At this point\nSporter (actually the Chess club) was\nfeeling very generous, so it was decided that $10 would be subsidized to every player for their dinner. he chosen\nvenue was Applebee\u2019s and we were not\ndisappointed! With pretty much the\nentire table ordering the 1800 calorie\nMac and Cheese with bacon, as well\nas another diabetes inducing dessert,\nwe were pretty much all very sated!\nSince the next day would be our\nlast in the beautiful US of A, everyone agreed that we should get up as\nearly as possible (AKA 8 O\u2019clock),\nso we could see as much as possible.\nHowever that plan was shot, when\neveryone decided that 8:00 was way\nto early, and the Guptas decided that\nin fact 10:30 itself would be too early\nas well. After several threatening Facebook messages, as well as going o\ufb00\nwithout them, they managed to sprint\nand catch up to us at the amazing\nBagel place we went to for breakfast.\nhings we did on that day includ-ed: Brooklyn bridge, Wall Street and\nGround Zero. However it was the\nStaten Island Ferry (free by the way)\nwhich stood out. However on the jour-neyback,mostoftheteamdecidedthat\na game of Secret Queens was in order\n(which Baron Luke won against Akshaya) or some much needed nap time,\ninstead of having a second look at the\nStatue of Liberty! What an outrage!!!\nAnyway, after this really outstand-ing, yet tiring day we had our last meal\nin the US, which was none other but\nsome classic McDonalds yet again!\nhereafter, we trudged over to Newark Airport once more. Without much\nhassle we boarded the plane, and\ncommenced once again in using and\nabusing the in-\ufb02ight entertainment!\nBefore you knew it, the Knight Riders\nhad touched down in Britain again!\nMuch thanks goes to Matthew, Austin, Johnny and all the other hosts and\norganizers of the US Universities as\nwell as Stu from the Marshall chess\nclass! Lastly I would like to thank all\nmy brilliant tour mates, as well as Sam\nSporter Porter who did so much to\nmake this possible! Till next year folks!\nY\nou \ufb01nd yourself in the\nlibrary; you have an exam/\ndeadline tomorrow that\nhas made your stress levels\nreach a new high. Hyped up on pro\nplus and red bull, a heavenly chorus\ndrifts in from Queens Tower and the\nmelodic chiming of the bells makes\neverything seem alright\u2026 Who am I\nkidding? Anybody with Facebook or\nTwitter is accustomed to the tirade\nof complaints about \u2018noise pollution\u2019\nand their suddenly sensitive ears. But\never wondered what is really going\non up there? What is change ringing\nand who are the mythical bell ringers?\nhe ancient English art of\ncampanology involves bell ringers\npulling ropes. hese are attached\nto wheels to turn bells through 360\ndegrees, not like the Mars advert.\nhis mechanism allows the ringers\nto control the bell, allowing them to\nring the mathematical permutations\nthat form change ringing.\nMost towers have 6 or 8 bells though\nsome, such as Queens Tower, have\n10. hey are arranged from smallest\n(\u2018the treble\u2019) to largest (\u2018the tenor\u2019),\nusually in a diatonic scale. he more\nbells you have, the possible changes\nand methods grow exponentially;\nas anyone who has done statistics\nwould know. his means that even\nthough bell ringing was started\nin the 17th century there are new\nmethods discovered every day and\nmany, many more yet to be realised.\nFounded in 1945, the University of\nLondon Society of Change Ringers\n(ULSCR) is the only bell ringing\nsociety available for students in\nLondon. And yes, even though it\nis UoL, Imperial students can join.\nWe practice on a hursday evening\nat the Church of St Olave\u2019s, Tower\nHill, though there are constant\nweekday and weekend quarter peals\norganised throughout the year. If you\nare wondering, a quarter-peal takes\napproximately 45 minutes, 1260\nchanges to be precise, and is rung for\nimportant occasions. A full peal is\n5060 changes and is usually reserved\nfor very special moments, such as the\nRoyal Baby, due to the colossal stamina\nrequired to concentrate for 3 hours.\nHowever, it\u2019s not all about ringing!\nPractises are always followed by\nvisits to a variety of pubs (sometimes\nconsecutively) and Sunday morning\nringing is usually followed by a\n\u2018Spoons breakfast and more drinking.\nWe also hold several ringing tours and\nsocial events over the year, the climax\nbeing the swanky annual dinner.\nSo do you \ufb01nd ringing a-peal-ing?\nInterested in learning the ropes? If\nyou like it, why not put a ring on it?\nOkay, I\u2019m all out of puns.

Along with stunning\ncinematography and special e\ufb00ects,\nwhat elevates Man of Steel from\nbeing a formulaic origins story is the\nexcellent casting. Boardwalk Empire\u2019s\nMichael Shannon is perfect as the\nmalicious Zod and Amy Adams\u2019 Lois\nLane is brilliantly feisty (a welcome\nbreak from previous incarnations).\nWorld War Z stars Brad Pitt as a UN\ndo-gooder trying to defeat a global\nzombie pandemic. Director Marc\nForster puts the \ufb01lm\u2019s astronomical\nbudget (reported to be $200 million)\nto spectacular use; depicting scenes\nof anarchy and carnage on a colossal\nscale, they feel chillingly authentic.\nWhilst the \ufb01lm may require a little\n\u2018cognitive estrangement\u2019 there is\nan overpowering sense of suspense\nlacking from many summer\nblockbusters.\nTuesday 8th October\n18:30-World War Z\n20:45-Man of Steel\nhursday 10th October\n18:30-Man of Steel\n21:15-World War Z\nTickets for individual screenings\nImperial Cinema\nAutumn Line up:\n15th/17th October: Despicable Me 2\n22nd/24th October: Paci\ufb01c Rim\n29th/31st October: he World\u2019s End\n5th/7th November: Elysium & he\nWolverine\n11th November: Kick-Ass 2\nare \u00a33 for members and \u00a34 for non-members, buy on the door.\nTickets for a double-bill are \u00a35 for\nmembers and \u00a37 for non-members.\n\u00a35 Membership includes one free\n\ufb01lm and cheaper ticket prices all year!\nBuy it here:\ntickets.imperialcinema.co.uk\nBFI London Film Festival: it\u2019s a New World after all...\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nNew World\nDirector: Hoon-jung Park\nWriter: Hoon-jung Park\nStarring: Jung-jae Lee, Min-sik\nChoi, Jung-min Hwang, Sungwoong Park\nRuntime: 134 minutes\nCertification: 18\nEven from its opening scene, New\nWorld means business. An already\nbloodied man gets further beating\nwhilst being interrogated. Those holding the hammers and crowbars are\nconvinced that he\u2019s a snitch, reporting their gang\u2019s activities to the po-lice. And herein lies the film\u2019s main\npremise - shifting loyalties between\ngood and bad, and a lead character\nreluctantly stuck in the middle of an\nimpending war.\nA cross between Infernal Affairs/\nThe Departed and The Godfather,\nthis highly sophisticated and stylish gangster film is the latest offering\nfrom South Korea, a part of the Asian\nmarket that excites the international\nmovie industry with some excellent\nnew offerings - of which this is certainly one.\nJa-sung (Jung-jae Lee) is an undercover police offcer who for the past\neight years or so, dedicated his life infiltrating one of the biggest, most dangerous crime syndicates in Korea. His\nhandler Chief Kang (Min-sik Choi)\npromises an end to this delicate nature\nof his job - but everything turns upside\ndown when the syndicate\u2019s boss dies\nin a sudden traffic accident.\nWith no clear sign of leadership or\nguidance, an internal power struggle\nsoon ensues, something the police are\nalso interested in - as they also have\na stake in who they can control more\nconveniently with whatever leverage\nthey have up their sleeve.\nSuddenly Ja-sung is thrown into\neven more backstabbing and betrayal\nthan he is prepared to handle, as even\nthe good guys appear rather shady\nwith their own intentions and mind-games with the syndicate members.\nThe two big names eyeing a potential takeover for power are Jung\nChung (Jung-min Hwang) and Joonggu (Sung-woong Park), and this competition is headed for disaster from\nday one as old rivalry resurfaces, one\nthat can only be settled when blood is\nspilled.\nAnd yes, plenty of blood is spilled\nthroughout, but the film is more interested in dialogue between these\nfascinating, layered characters played\nby some of the top acting names in\nKorea.\nMin-sik Choi is excellent at keeping\nhis cool even in the most unfavourable scenarios for his character, and\nwith his suave demeanour he rattles\nthe criminals - he is an actor of pure\ncharisma, something he puts to good\nuse here. Jung-jae Lee also shines in\nthe lead, as a man ready to crack under\nthe enormous pressure.\nBut the actor taking the acting cake\nis without doubt Jung-min Hwanghis unmatchable knack for handling\nthe outrageously hysterical as well as\nthe deadly serious in one clean swoop,\nis a talent showcase for Hwang who\nconsistently steals every scene he\u2019s in.\nWhen it comes to the action that\nno doubt got its 18 certificate from,\ndirector Park dreams small, but is always intricate in his design and set-up.\nEven the briefest moment of stand-off\nis a hugely tense one, a gun-fight of\na few minutes is extraordinary, and a\nknife-fight in a parking lot is a sight to\nbehold.\nThe closing scene is one that is\nhugely reminiscient of The Godfather,\nand much like its inspiration, here\u2019s\na gangster/crime film that delivers\nmuch of its power through words.\n25\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\n\n"

Totten\nComment Editor\notten\n@eoghantotten\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\nT\nhis article was catalysed by\nthe recent conference of\nhe Conservative Party held\nin Manchester, where voluminous Government policy\nwas proposed and discussed. he\n\u2018Work for Bene\ufb01ts\u2019 plan proved to be\na topic of discussion as Chancellor,\nGeorge Osborne, revised the criteria\nfor Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance Quali\ufb01cation.\nHis proposals (in relation to long-term unemployed British citizens)\nwere threefold. First o\ufb00, he intends\nto galvanise candidates towards work\nplacements, including roles such as\n\u201ccleaning up litter\u201d. Secondly, provided that this measure failed to be embellished and augmented, daily Job\nCentre visits would become compul-sory. he \ufb01nal proposal encompassed\nparticipation in compulsory skills\ntraining. To cite George Osborne,\n\u201chere is no option of doing nothing for your bene\ufb01ts, no something-for-nothing anymore.\u201d\n\u201chey will do useful work to put\nsomething back into their commu-nity; making meals for the elderly,\ncleaning up litter\u2026and for those with\nunderlying problems, like drug addiction and illiteracy, there will be an\nintensive regime of support.\u201d\nTo my mind the Chancellor\u2019s comments appeared condescending to\nthe many millions of people beneath\nthe breadline across the UK. While\nhonouring the mantra of he Conservative Party (\u2018For Hardworking\nPeople\u2019) they unilaterally demon-ise those people receiving bene\ufb01ts.\nhere is no mention of the thousands\nof overly-quali\ufb01ed denizens (with in\ufb01nitely many pre\ufb01xes to their names)\nwho, locked into the bene\ufb01t system\nby circumstance, \ufb01nd that there is no\nplace for their skills within a fragile\nBritish economy. George Osborne\nhas instead chosen to uniformly\ndenigrate the \ufb01nancially unfortunate,\ncaricaturing them as unskilled and\ndebauched; all because they are dependent upon the State.\nWhere unemployment bene\ufb01t was\nonce conveyed as a compassionate,\nhumanitarian safety net, it is now\nmisconstrued as a burden to the British taxpayer.\nMeanwhile the Health Secretary,\nJeremy Hunt, addressed the Forty\nGroup (MPs with slender majorities\nin their constituencies), putting forward a \ufb01ve point plan for \u2018routing\u2019 the\nopposition. To quote Mr. Randeep\nRamesh of he Guardian,\n\u201che most striking thing was the\nTory recasting of Ed Miliband\u2026the\nmessage of the labour leader had to\nshift from him being \u2018hopeless to dangerous\u2019 as the public has sympathy\nfor \u2018hopeless\u2019 people because they are\nseen as underdogs.\u201d\nIt could be argued that the meeting\u2019s focus typi\ufb01ed the crux of modern Tory politics, where voters are\nregarded as pawns on a political\nchessboard. his is evident in context\nof many initiatives spearheaded by the\ncoalition. David Cameron\u2019s veto of the\nrecent European Treaty, attempts to\nredact the Human Rights Act, zero-hour contracts, the bedroom tax and\nthe trimming of disability allowance\nconvey to voters that there is always\nsomeone beneath them, burdening\nboth themselves and the UK \ufb01scally,\neven morally.\nhe e\ufb03cacy of these initiatives can\nalso be called into question. Department for Work & Pensions \ufb01gures\ndemonstrate a 10% success rate for the\n2011 \u2018Compulsory Work\u2019 scheme. It\nis possible that intricate layers of bureaucracy serve as a bu\ufb00er, preserving the true wealth among the few. By\nadhering to the party and not to the\npeople, politicians may be perceived\nto be laying the seeds for a British plu-tocracy.\nIn my opinion this provides a crucial opening for Labour politics and\nits leader Ed Miliband. With twenty\nmonths to go until the 2015 general\nelection his opinion polls are beginning to gain momentum. Despite\nmany accusations that he is un\ufb01t to be\nthe next Prime Minister, he continues\nto weather the political storm.\nIn spite of this one cannot ignore the\nsevere implications of the Falkirk seat\nrow regarding Labour\u2019s crucial link\nto trade unions. Allegations that the\nUnite union recruited upwards of one\nhundred members in an e\ufb00ort to install Katie Murphy as party candidate\nresulted in a major rift between Labour and Unite. he comments of union General Secretary, Len McCluskey, cemented the rift. He announced\nthat he was, \u201cobliged to uphold the integrity of Unite and I can no longer do\nso on the basis of\u2026Labour\u2026in which I\ncan place no trust.\u201d\nEd Miliband\u2019s speech at the recent\nLabour party conference in Brighton\nalso sparked controversy. His pledge\nto impose two year energy price freezes from 2015 to 2017 kick-started a\nwelcome surge in opinion polls (Labour\u2019s UKPR polling average of 39\nwith respect to the Tory\u2019s 32). Indeed\nwhen commenting to he Guardian the chief executive of Lightsource\nRenewable Energy, Mick Boyle, commended Ed Miliband\u2019s e\ufb00orts to rumble the oligopoly of \u2018the big six\u2019.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t agree with his price-freezing proposals\u2026but a breakup\nwill see more investment in the UK,\nnot less.\u201d Similar sentiments partially\nassisted the Labour leader in evading\nthe anti-business label stamped on\nhim by the Government. It proved insu\ufb03cient to stave o\ufb00 the scepticism he\nreceived from many quarters. Many\npragmatists, including students of Imperial College London, will be acutely\naware of the projected energy surplus\nof the UK (marginal, less than 2%) by\n2015/16. Some may even harbour a\ngrave concern for impending \u2018blackouts\u2019.\nIn sum, it is Ed Miliband\u2019s evasion of\nconcrete statistics that may prove to\nbe the fatal wound to his election cam-paign. On the \ufb02ip side his ethics, combined with his academic background,\nmay prove to be his saving grace. his\nwas highlighted by the recent slander\nof Ralph Miliband (prominent Marxist thinker and father to Ed) by he\nDaily Mail. hey released an article\nentitled \u201che man who hated Britain\u201d.\nKen Livingstone and Alistair Campbell (former Director of Downing\nStreet Communications under Tony\nBlair) were among the politicians to\njump to his defence. Ed Miliband\u2019s anger was plain to see in a televised interview with the BBC. It harmonised\nwith his letter to Labour newsletter\nsubscribers. He stated,\n\u201chis isn\u2019t about me and my family \u2013 this is about doing what\u2019s right.\u201d\nRoss Hawkins, a BBC political correspondent reported that there was no\n\u201csure-\ufb01re way of knowing\u2026how many\nvoters share his outrage.\u201d\nFor me, it was good to see some\ngenuine emotion from a politician; if\nanything, I found it endearing. Recent\npolitical developments on the global\nplatform, capped by the shutdown of\nthe US Government, prove that politics is a delineated and complex collection of catacombs where an individual is hard pushed to adhere to his\nor her fundamental principles. his\nis an accepted reality and one that\nfuelled Ralph Miliband\u2019s pioneering\n1972 work \u2018Parliamentary Socialism\u2019.\nHe believed that Labour was rendered\nine\ufb00ective by the con\ufb01nes of Government, forced to adopt increasingly\nempirical politics.\nEd Miliband, di\ufb00ering from his father by moving towards the centre\nleft, accepts this empiricism as a good\nthing. Time has told us that an individual entering politics will always\nsuccumb to compromise and, ulti-mately, disrepute. If Ed Miliband can\ncontinue to reveal his ethics at a distance from politics and display genuine concern for the needs of the UK\nelectorate, Labour opinion polls may\nfurther surge.\nFreshers week\nThe great equaliser\nDo you think you can write better than\nme?

    "content": "31\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\nFOOD\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nCarol Ann Cheah got the answer through the post\nIt\u2019s not everyday that the Felix Food\ncrew gets to review something that\nwas featured and acclaimed on BBC\u2019s\nDragons\u2019 Den. Back in August I was\ntrawling through FEAST at Battersea Park with the just-as-much-of-a-foodie (if not more) boyfriend (in fact\nBattersea was his idea, I was busy revising for resits and UROP-ing at the\ntime to think of Food-related press.)\nPrior to that we\u2019d heard of Gousto\nbeing mentioned on the interwebs a\nfew times, and decided to drop by the\nstall to leave our contact details. hey\nsoon got in touch, and we agreed to a\nreview box - not long after, we were\nwatching Duncan Bannatyne display\nhis cooking prowess with one of the\nrecipes we\u2019d picked. Talk about striking gold, we say!\nFood delivery boxes - be they snacks\na\u2019la Graze or fresh fruit/veg/meat\nboxes by the Riverford crew - seem to\nbe gaining quite a bit of traction with\nus Brits. Now I really should use \u201cus\u201d\nloosely, not being actual Brit myself;\nbut I digress - when you\u2019ve lost count\nof the number of friends using such\nservices (a former Food editor being a Riverford customer, and a bajil-lion mates including your housemate\nbeing massive Graze fans), it\u2019s hard\nto not pay attention to this concept\nmushrooming about.\nGousto (pronounced goo-stow) is\none such company, but instead of just\ngiving you a ton of purely fresh produce like Riverford, they\u2019ve gone the\nextra mile of portioning it up with\nother ingredients/seasonings - and\ngiving you recipes to cook it with. he\nbest part? Little to no food waste, so\ngood for those of you who are clueless\non portion sizes and need a bit of hand\nholding (new fresher cooks, I\u2019m looking at you.) You don\u2019t need to provide\nmuch apart from salt, oil, pepper and\nmaybe a bit of milk/butter depending\non the recipe, but they\u2019ll tell you if you\nneed to have anything extra (and it\nwon\u2019t be a huge ingredient.) It\u2019s quite\nsimple - you go on their website, order your box by picking your 3 recipes\nfor the week (they list ingredients so if\nyou don\u2019t eat meat/\ufb01sh you can avoid\nthose) and Bob\u2019s your uncle - just wait\nfor your box. Like Graze, you can\npause deliveries if you\u2019re away, or stop\naltogether whenever you feel like it.\nIt seemed after that Dragon\u2019s Den\nepisode the excitement over our box\u2019s\narrival was infectious - when we collected our box from the Felix office,\nit was already open...a certain Union\nsta\ufb00 member had been too eager to\nsee what was inside that she got our\ned-in-chief to open it and let her have\na peek. Nevertheless the packaging\nwas impeccable - produce and ingredients arrived pretty much intact, all\nthe fresh stu\ufb00 stayed nicely chilled until I managed to fridge it up, and we\nall agreed it looked fantastic. It was\nonly after bringing the box home that\nI\u2019d noticed one of the Dijon mustard\nmini-containers had somehow come\napart and left some mustard inside\none of the ingredient bags (boo!), but\nit wasn\u2019t the end of the world. Everything came nicely labelled (with the\nodd bit of wit, not unlike Innocent\njuices), so there was no reason to goof\nup with the wrong ingredient - or\nwrong portion sizes for recipe, as two\nof our recipes shared a few ingredients\nlike potatoes.\nWe had a 2-person box and picked\nthree recipes: Bavarian Fleischp\ufb02anzerl (fancy way of saying meatballs)\nwith sauteed rosemary potatoes,\nrump steak with roasted potato wedges and Italian gremolata, and *that*\nfamous honey mustard glazed trout\n\ufb01llet with summer salad, a\u2019la Duncan\nBannatyne/BBC. All the portioned-up\ngrub came with their corresponding\nrecipes in the form of lovely cards,\nwhich can be kept and re-used should\nyou like the recipes enough.\nOn day 1 I was alone, so I made the\ntrout salad in one go and decided to\ntest how well it kept the next day. Sure\nenough Duncan and the fellow Dragons weren\u2019t amiss when they lapped\nup the salad, and I discovered with\nthis recipe that I actually like beetroot (having never tried it before,\nhow odd!) hat and Dijon mustard\n- the recipe broke whatever misconceptions I had about crappy yellow\nmustard, as I didn\u2019t like it much when\nyounger. It should also be said that the\nsalad tasted just as great (if not bet-ter) the next day, as the \ufb02avours had\nmore time to mingle - I had fridged it\nand brought it with me to get through\nmy UROP lunch hour. he salad itself\nwas fresh, zingy and appetising, full of\nyummy stu\ufb00 to hit your 5-a-day without making you feel like a wannabe\nWAG pushing a lone leaf about on\na plate. It\u2019s actually a salad for salad-haters.\nA few days after we test-drove the\nBavarian Fleischp\ufb02anzerl, with my\nhousemate Phil as a willing guinea\npig. Now Phil eats a bit more than I\ndo (and I can eat quite a bit), but we\u2019re\nhappy to report that the portion sizes\nwere just nice. I do wonder how they\u2019d\ncater for customers who are bottomless pits of huge appetites, but I suppose these customers have their ways!\nWe\u2019re not too sure what we could\u2019ve\ndone about the meatballs falling apart\na bit, but they were still yummy - and\nthe recipe did get you making them\nfrom scratch, which is a nice therapeutic plus.\nNot too long after we had the \ufb01nal\nmeal of the pack - rump steak with\ngremolata. Phil likes his cooked a bit\nmore towards medium/medium well,\nbut I like mine medium rare or rare;\nthe instructions only covered cooking\ntill medium rare. Luckily this wasn\u2019t\nquite my \ufb01rst steak, and I do cook\nquite a bit of it with my boyfriend\n(well he cooks it more), but it would\u2019ve\nbeen nice to see a bit more detail on\ngetting di\ufb00erent levels of steak done-ness. Can\u2019t however fault this being a\ngreat recipe to introduce steak virgins\nto cooking and prepping it.\nAll in all we did come away with a\ngood impression of Gousto, and we\nthink it\u2019s a great product - but it might\nnot be for everyone in our readership\ndue to cost (students, I\u2019m looking at\nyou.) Some of us would also like to see\nsome one-person boxes happen in the\nfuture, though personally as a \u201ccook\nahead and eat leftovers for lunch\u201d\nperson (and because cooking for one\nproduces just as much mess) I\u2019m not\nsure how feasible that might be. Below we\u2019ve made a bit of a pros and\ncons list/recap, but it\u2019s up to you. We\u2019d\nlove to see where the Gousto boys -Timo and James - take this concept\nto...g\u2019luck, chaps!\nWhat we loved\n- Little to no food waste. It\u2019s probably\nthe key selling point here.\n- Quality produce and ingredients.\nhey just speak for themselves - I\u2019m\nnot a food snob, I\u2019d happily eat not-quite-organic/free-range produce (I\nknow my budget, but I buy as local\nand as not-chemically-laced as I can);\nbut this is a major plus.\n- Great balanced recipes that change\nwith the season - extremely well-written, concise, but doesn\u2019t skimp on\ndetail like prep/cooking time + background info to help you plan ahead.\n- Nothing crazily fussy, so they\u2019re not\nforcing you to use insane che\ufb00y techniques or spend hours in the kitchen\n(30-40 mins most from start to \ufb01nish, then however long you take to\neat). Just the kind of food that\u2019s simple\nenough to get you cooking regularly,\nyet great tasting to keep you from a\nrut.\n- Good way to try something new,\nbe it an ingredient or recipe or tech-nique. here\u2019s always something new\nto learn!\nWhat we didn\u2019t dig\n- You only get 3 meals for 2 people (6\nportions) per week (there\u2019s a 4-person\noption though) - though if you\u2019re willing to fork out a bit more, you can privately arrange for a 5-meal box\n- It\u2019s 42 quid a week for the above box\n(vegetarian boxes cost 3 quid less),\nwhich comes up to 7 quid a meal -quite a hefty tag, though the premium\nis because all the ingredients are or-ganic/free-range and you\u2019re also paying for someone to do the legwork of\nportioning/thinking what to cook for\nyou.\n- It\u2019s not as spontaneous (Kelly Hoppen, you read my mind) - you have\nto decide by Wednesday night what\nyou want for the next Tuesday, which\ndoesn\u2019t help if you then change your\nmind - but it\u2019s only because they need\ntime to source and prepare ingre-dients. Understandable, but if there\nwere some way to reduce how far\nahead people need to decide (even if it\nwas a few days less), it would be even\nbetter. You can\u2019t have it all though,\nwhich is fair.\n- Not every recipe is next-day-friendly,\nbut they\u2019re operating on the impression that you\u2019re cooking for two and\neating it all there and then! However if\nyou\u2019re buying the box just for yourself,\nthat\u2019s the only thing you can do atm.\nhey\u2019re hoping to o\ufb00er single-person\nboxes though, so watch this space\u2026\nGeneral verdict\nWould heartily recommend, but not\nfor everyone. Perhaps ideal for busy\nImperial sta\ufb00 who don\u2019t like thinking\nabout food shopping or portioning\nthings up, but still want to cook. For\nstudents, maybe a once-in-a-blue-moon thing only because of budgetary\nreasons (it\u2019s cheaper to do your own\nfood shop and put a bit more fore-thought/learning) - Carol will however certainly be on the lookout to see\nif something unique comes up on the\nweekly recipe rotation...\nDislaimer: Gousto sent us a complimentary box back in Sept 03 for\nreview and consideration - special\nthanks to Aidan Willcocks at Gousto\nfor arranging this for us! All opinions\nhowever are our own - our duty is to\nyou, the reader.\nLearn more: www.gousto.co.uk\nWhat does Gousto mean?\nExtra points for environmental friendly box and the lovely message!\n\n"

Instead of agreeing to a bill to fund the\nstate, every one of the 100 Senators\nand the 435 Representatives decided\nto simply let the October 1st deadline\nrun out. \u201cWe realised we were becoming obsessed with the new budget. It\nwas unhealthy\u201d said speaker of the\nHouse, John Boehner. President of\nthe Senate, Joe Biden was similarly effusive \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get all het-up about\nthese things. Taking a step back and\nletting the current deal expire will really allow us to chill out\u201d. \u201cI think we\nreally deserve that\u201d he added. Whilst,\nthere has been a split amongst elected\no\ufb03cials as to whether to go on a holiday or simply lounge around at home,\nall were agreed that the downtime\nwas well-earned. \u201cYou know, we can\u2019t\nagree on all the details\u201d said Minority\nLeader Mitch McConnell before adding \u201cthe important thing is that we all\nget a decent rest\u201d. At press time, President Obama has been seen taking\nsome time to mow the White House\nlawn. Vice-President Biden, however,\nhas been sighted getting o\ufb00 a plane in\nIbiza.\nAs the traditional IC Union Mingle\nwas going on, so was a so-called\n\u2018Alternative Mingle\u2019, for people who\ndon\u2019t like the sort of music played\nat the Mingle, hosting a series of\nlive music acts instead of a DJ who\nstill insists that he is 27 despite\nhis grey hair and faded tattoos.\nhe Union was not best pleased with\nthe presence of the Alternative Mingle.\nA Union spokesperson said, \u201chis is\ncompletely missing the point of the\nMingle. he Mingle has been carefully\ndesigned by a team of sociologists to\ncreate an environment in which people\ncan make as many friends as possible.\u201d\n\u201chis is achieved by making the\nnight as awful as we can so that\npeople have no choice but to buy\ndrinks and talk to one another.\u201d\nOur Hangman journalist Timothy\nMcSweeney asked one of the\norganisers of the Alternative\nMingle exactly how a separate event\nencouraged people to mingle, and\nwe received the following statement:\n\u201che Alternative Mingle is for\npeople who don\u2019t want to go to\nthe Mingle because they might\nnot like it. We understand that\nit\u2019s all about meeting new people,\nbut really, who wants to meet\nsomeone that likes di\ufb00erent things?\u201d\n\u201cNext year, we\u2019re hoping to have\nseveral alternative alternative mingles\nso that people can only go to things\nthey like with people that like the same\nthing. It\u2019s the best way to meet people\u201d\n\u201che long term goal is to have an\nindividual mingle for each person,\none that is tailored to their favourite\nactivities. You know, a bit like the\nMirror of ERISED from Harry Potter.\u201d\nFRIDAY 04 OCT\nARIES\nTAURUS\nGEMINI\nCANCER\nLEO\nVIRGO\nLIBRA\nSCORPIO\nSAGITTARIUS\nCAPRICORN\nAQUARIUS\nPISCES\nThis week, you\u2019re a super awesome RAG committee member\nwelcoming fresher students.\nAs you hug some drunkard,\nhe slowly gurgles snakebite-tainted puke down your back\nthat blends in perfectly to your\nviolently pink polo shirt. You\ndon\u2019t realise until two days\nlater when you feel a pigeon\npecking chunks of it from your\nshoulder.\nThis week you go to Reynolds for the first time. You\nfind yourself actually enjoying sitting on vomit stained\nfloors, chanting in unison\nwith other air-headed \u201cmedical students,\u201d as some guy\ndowns a litre of Tesco value\nvodka. Expect to be hated by\nhall mates for the rest of the\nyear when you fail to shut up\nabout it.\nThis week, being the crazy\nfresher that you are, you decide to steal a traffic cone.\nWhilst heavily intoxicated you\ncarefully select your roadside\ntrophy, drag the dead weight\nback to halls and triumphantly pass out. You wake up\nsearching for your prize, only\nto find you dragged home\na dead tramp in a sleeping\nbag by mistake.\nThis week you\u2019re too shy to talk\nto people so start chatting to\nyour illegal rice cooker instead.\nYou name it Wilson, and tell it\nthe hopes and dreams you harbour of getting that first. A Subwarden finds you dry humping it four days later, whilst it\nboasts a face made out of your\nblood...\nThis week you return from your\nyear in Industry, flashing your\neasy-earned cash from being\nthe Goldman Sachs coffee\nbitch. You attempt to pay for\nyour coffee (espresso) with a\nfifty in the library cafe, only to\nhave some PhD student steal\nit from you, manically cackling\nafter not eating properly all\nsummer.\nThis week, you find the fabled\nfresher on your course that\n\u201ctotally rejected Oxford,\u201d and\nlisten to how he just can\u2019t wait\nfor the awesome London party\nscene that Oxford could only\ndream of. You find him later\nafter a night in Metric, slowly\nsobbing into his framed acceptance letter as he tries to\ntransfer back last minute.\nYou read out the previous horoscope to your kitchen as you\npredrink for another wild night\nat Fabric, and you all laugh at\nhow untrue it is and how you\nare all going to be friends for-ever. An awkward pause fol-lows, whilst you all contemplate\nthe utopia of true friendship you\ndesperately hope to discover\none day.\nThis week you form vapid,\nempty, temporary friendships\nwith the people in your kitchen\nby bonding over A-level exams\nand failed Oxbridge interviews.\nYou change your profile picture\nto one of 200 group photos from\na night out, with the caption\n#Freshers2013, whilst secretly\nhoping to meet better people\nand dump this group of airheads\nThis week, you proudly hang a\nred lanyard around your neck.\nYou\u2019ve made it! You can fully\nbuy discounted coffee! Imperial is the best place ever! A\ncynical second year student\njumps you and cuts it off,\nsevering your carotid artery\nin the process. Red spreads\nfrom the lanyard through that\nfreshly ironed shirt.\nThis week finally met the Doctor at the Freshers\u2019 Fair! Go\nyou! You ask him to take you\naway to a distant place and\ntime only to find out that you\nhave to do him a favour first.\nAfter you climb out of the Heart\nof the TARDIS, remove your\npink tutu and stop shivering\nhe takes you to the future. Welcome to Exam Week!\nIt\u2019s been a long week and\nyou\u2019ve almost done an all-nighter. As you walk back towards your room at 7 AM you\nsee the eager Sabbs arriving\nfor work. Oh wait, they\u2019re going home as well, having been\nkept awake all night by their\npink t-shirts. They jump you\nand fight over the scraps of\nyour fashionable shirt.\nThis week you search in earnest for the Masturbation Soc\nat Fresher\u2019s Fair, after some\nsecond year told you it was a\nkey part of the Imperial way of\nlife. After asking everyone you\nmeet where the stall may be,\nyou finally realised you misunderstood just what that student\nsaid, and shuffle sadly to your\nbedside drawer instead.\nHangman\u2019s Finest College News Source\nthe turnip\nUS Government to Treat\nItself to Autumn Getaway\nMIKE SEGAR/REUTERS\nAlternative Mingle\nMisses the Point A\nfter months of heady banter,\nsecond and third year\nstudents have set their targets\nfor just how many freshers they plan\nto sleep with during fresher\u2019s week.\nUnfortunately, the Hangman can\no\ufb03cially report that every single\none of these students has failed\nto hook up with a fresher despite\ntheir Shakespearean chat-up lines:\n\u201cSo, what do you study?\u201d\n\u201cYou look foreign, where are you\nfrom?\u201d\n\u201cWhat hall do you live in? Does your\nwindow face the street?\u201d\nBritain\u2019s leading expert, Dr. Tom\nPerignon from the Institute\nfor Pretend Sociology says that\nthis is to be entirely expected.\n\u201cOur latest research shows that\neven a few months at Imperial is\nenough to cause a person\u2019s social\nskills to completely atrophy. Like\na muscle, social skills waste away\nif they are not used often enough.\nInterestingly, many students develop\na coping mechanism known as \u2018Nerd\nElitism\u2019 where they refuse to talk about\nanything that does not interest them. In\nsevere cases, these students arbitrarily\nhate those that do not know how to\nplay all of the songs from Ocarina\nof Time on a touch-tone phone.\n\u201d\nEVERYONE TOO AFRAID\nTO TALK TO FRESHERS\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCS\n32 FRIDAY 04 OCT\nVolunteering @ Imperial\nBen Fernando\nCharity Editor\nSo no doubt you\u2019ve been accosted by various charities\nat the Freshers\u2019 fair. If, like me, you signed up to all\ntheir mailing lists and are completely lost as to who\ndoes what and can\u2019t decide what to do because you\u2019re\nnot sure what they do and don\u2019t do, then this is article\nis for you.\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of not-for\npro\ufb01t work that go on at Imperial. I have about 400\nwords left to describe them all so apologies if I miss\nanyone out!\n1) RAG\nRAG is the largest student group at the\nunion \u2013 you\u2019re all members! (we don\u2019t give you a\nchoice - we just sign you up, muhahahaha). We\u2019re\nresponsible for the fundraising at the Imperial. We do\nthis through the traditional pounce-on-you-in-the-street-until-you-beg-for-mercy-and-give-us-your-change method, but most of our funds come from our\nevents like the Freshers\u2019 Ball, the Bungee Jump, Rubix\nCube party and so on. We also take care of a number\nof smaller groups on campus like Save the Children\nand UNICEF, and the challenges abroad (like Kili).\nIf you\u2019re interested in what we call FUN-raising then\ndrop us a line at rag@imperial.ac.uk.\n2) CAG\nCommunity Action Group is responsible for\nthe volunteering at Imperial, that is, things that don\u2019t\nexplicitly involve raising money. You can volunteer to\ndo just about anything through one of their projects -from gardening, teaching, helping refugees, teaching\nkids to code to building schools and designing\nsolutions to environmental problems. Lots of their\nactivities are similar to the Imperial Hub\u2019s, so contact\neither of them at iccag@imperial.ac.uk or president@\nimperialhub.org\n3) Everything else!\nhere are a huge number of miscellaneous\nnot-for-pro\ufb01t activities that go on at Imperial. Some\nare run by departments (i.e. Physics\u2019s \u2018Communicating\nPhysics\u2019 course); others by faith groups (Islamic Society\nare insanely good at raising money!) and a few are run\nby random individuals. We\u2019re planning to put together\na full database of these programs in the coming year.\nIn short you can do just about anything. he various\ngroups help people from all over the world, ranging\nfrom Kensington to Kenya and from El Salvador to\nEast London. If you \ufb01nd that something that isn\u2019t\nsupported, no worries! Anyone can set up a society\nor project at Imperial, and there is funding to help\nworthwhile causes.\nI suspect that many of you have got to the end of this\nand have decided that it sounds really cool but you\u2019re\njust too busy. Or not! You can\u2019t get away that easily!\nBoth RAG and CAG can take people for shorter\nvolunteering stints, from half an hour a week for the\nsuper-busy up to about \ufb01fteen hours a week (yes, that\u2019s\nhow long I was spending on RAG in the run-up to\nRAG week!).\nNext week I\u2019ll go through some of the reasons why\nit\u2019s worth joining in the volunteering at Imperial, but\nuntil then email me if you have any questions! rag.\ntreasurer@imperial.ac.uk \u2013 I promise I don\u2019t bite.\nhere\u2019s a brief guide to charity at Imperial in 529\nwords. Do get involved!\n\u201cAre you a\npart of a club\nor society?\nOr do you go\nclubbing? Are\nyou sociable?\nDo you like\nprojects? Yes,\nYes, Yes? Then\nwrite in with\nsomething\ninteresting\nabout your\nclub, like a two\npage report\non a Chess\nTour! Who\nknew these\nguys were so\ngood?\u201d\nA\nfter a very successful\nyear dominating British chess, the British\nUni and London Uni\nChampions (your resident chess team) decided that they\nneeded a new challenge. So when ex-President Sam \u201cSporter\u201d Porter began\norganizing the trip to the US, a lot of\nexcitement and anticipation started to\narise. With big names like Princeton\nand Columbia on the menu, Imperial Chess was really looking forward\nto making a name for themselves out\nthere in the land of opportunity. In\nfact we set out with a very strong team\nwith big ambitions, including our\nown FIDE Master (FM) Ryan Grif\ufb01ths and El Presidente Arijit Gupta.\nhe night before was spent in\npreparation, with a gathering of half\nthe team: Sporter, Baron Luke Barron, FM Ryan and myself playing exchange (a very enjoyable variation of\nchess which allows even the weakest players to beat extremely strong\nplayers) and drinking in the Union,\nand generally just bouncing strategies o\ufb00 each other that we would use\nto destroy our opposition. However\nsince our \ufb02ight was relatively early\non the next day, we decided to call it\na day and reconvene in the airport.\nhe next day dawned rainy and\ncloudy, however that did not dampen the spirits of the Chess team as\nwe all arrived early (or perhaps not\nso early in some cases) and without\nmuch hassle we all boarded the plane.\nSoon the in\ufb02ight entertainment system was discovered, with its option\nof multiplayer chess and movies,\nand the \ufb02ight was soon played away.\nOnce we arrived in the US things\nquickly became more complicated.\nDue to a very absent-minded border\nsecurity guard, Sporter, El Presidente,\nAditya (Adi) Gupta and Akshaya Ahuja all took at least 30 minutes to pass\nthrough, while the rest of the team\nslowly got more and more worried that\nthey had all been interrogated. However after that slight complication,\n(plus a few more), we \ufb01nally made it to\nour monster of a minibus which was\nsubsequently named the Knight Rider.\nWith some trepidation we approached\nthe twelve seat, 4 meter beast, and, as\nI was the one who had to drive it, with\na lot of fear. A lot of trouble was had\ngetting out of the parking lot, however\nonce all the start-stop crap had been\novercome it was as smooth as a pawns\ntop. hus the knight riders were born!\nWe duly arrived in Princeton, after\nhaving our \ufb01rst real American meal,\nnamely McDonald\u2019s, and were met\nby Austin and George, two members\nof the Princeton chess club. We were\nput into di\ufb00erent dorms of various\nhosts, as well as the house of one of\nthe student\u2019s chess tutors Johnny (who\nturned out to be an absolute legend).\nhe morning after, still in\ufb02uenced\nby severe jetlag (at least some of us),\nwe found each other and recounted\nof our nights escapades, for me this\nincluded a surprisingly comfortable evening spent next to Luke,\nwho went as far as calling it roman-tic, on a sofa bed. We spent the day\nchilling, chilling Princeton style. A\nbreakfast of pancakes (which were\namazing), a visit to Walmart, as well\nas some games of footie and chess\non the beautiful Princeton campus\nwere all used as welcome relaxation\nand were drumming up quite a lot\nof local interest. After a rather \ufb01lling burrito and an introduction to\nthe triangle game (which to my absolute delight has still not been solved\nby some), we once again separated\nto return to our beds/sleeping bags.\nhe second day saw the Knight Riders take on New York. After some\ninitial di\ufb03culty parking the Knight\nRider (resulting in a $115 \ufb01ne,\nYOLO), we started our tour of Manhattan. We did do the obligatory walk\nthrough Central park, however the\ntwo things that were on every Chess\ngeek\u2019s mind were: 1) Chess Hustlers\nof Washington Square and 2) he\nMarshall Chess Club. herefore without much further ado (and with the\nclich\u00e9 panorama picture), we made\nour way to the Chess Hustlers. What\nwe saw there did not disappoint. We\nwere pretty much overwhelmed by\na circle of Chess tables with various\npeople in di\ufb00erent states of disarray sitting at these tables crying out:\n\u201cChess Plaayyyyers, 3 Dollars a game,\n5 for 2!\u201d nicely complemented by some\nsoft jazz playing in the background.\nSo with quiet con\ufb01dence FM Ryan\nsat down and destroyed his opponent,\nupon whose face you could slowly see\nthe dawning realisation that he had\nabsolutely no chance. Next Baron\nLuke decided to give a chess hustler\na try. While his win was less assertive (he was shaking and with less\nthan 30 seconds on the clock) he\nnonetheless managed to beat his op-ponent. However once El Presidente\ntried to win some actual money, his\nchosen opponent decided to meditate instead of lose his money! What\nan outrage! Another bene\ufb01t of our\nstay at Washington Square was the\nfact that Alex (Gandal\ufb01ano) Galliano (our second board) managed to\njoin us. Without any hesitation he sat\ndown at one of the tables and superbly checkmated one of the hustlers.\nAfterourdominatingdisplay,noneof\nthe hustlers wanted to play the Knight\nRiders anymore, so it seemed like the\ntime to leave. Luckily Baron Luke had\nmet and talked to (as he does with every stranger) the president of the Marshall chess club, who luckily enough\ninvited us to a tournament there.\nhe Marshall is a world famous club\nwhich boasts several famous personages throughout its illustrious history,\nincluding Stanley Kubrick, Hikaro\nNakamura and Bobbie Fischer. In fact\nit is also the location where Fischer\ncontested the game of the century!\nSadly we were not able to make the\nbeginning of the tournament itself,\nafter failing to park the Knight rider\nin the busy New York streets. However we did manage to see the last\ntwo rounds, and in fact there were 4\nGrand Masters in attendance, so we\nwere not disappointed! Since it was\ngetting late though, Princeton was a\nbit of a drive and the fact that we were\ngoing to play the current Ivy League\nchampions, the big match of the tour,\nthe next day led to the decision that\nthe knight riders should call it a day.\nAnd without much further ado (how-ever a stop for greasy New York pizza\nwas included), we made our way back\nto Princeton and split up once again.\nhe next day arrived duly, and even\nthough some people (Adi and El Presidente) had problems getting up, the\nHardcore Pawn: IC Ches\nMax Eggl tells the tale of Imperial Chess He\nRAG Treasurer\nICU CHESS\nDid I ever tell you about the time I was arrested in the USA for graf\ufb01ti?\n\n"

After sitting\nempty for over 150 years due\nto \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d, since the\nlate 1990s it has been home to\nsome of the most talked-about\ncontemporary artworks that\nLondoners have ever had the joy\n(or despair) of witnessing, from\na life-sized \ufb01gure of Christ to a\ngiant ship in a bottle. he Fourth\nPlinth Commissioning Group\nannounced last week the 6 piece\nshortlist for the 2015/16 display,\nfrom which two will be selected.\nSo which is your favourite? Do\nyou prefer Leckey\u2019s surrealist\nstructure or Lijn\u2019s dancing duo?\nOr perhaps you\u2019d give Shrigley\u2019s\nidea the thumbs-up? Visit the\nwebsite or scan the QR code\nto cast your vote now \u2013 results\nannounced in next week\u2019s Felix!\ntinyurl.com/ofqfwhn\nModels of the six proposals are on\nshow in the crypt of St Martin in the\nFields church in Trafalgar Square\nuntil17thNovember.Admissionfree.\nReally Good \u2013 David Shrigley\nA 10m tall elongated thumbs-up sign,\ncast in bronze. What\u2019s not to like?\nReally Good is a brilliantly sarcastic\nidea from David Shrigley, a\nGlaswegian artist known for his\ndeliberately naive deadpan humour.\nApparently Shrigley hopes that the\nsculpture, if made, will become a\nself-ful\ufb01lling prophecy, and \u201cmake\nTrafalgar Square, London, the\nUK and the world a better place\u201d.\nBut there\u2019s always something a bit\nunnerving about aspects of the\nhuman body taken out of proportion\nthat means it might not be popular.\nIt\u2019s also possibly, for the younger\ngeneration at least, a bit too \u2018Facebook\u2019.\nThe Dance \u2013 Liliane Lijn\nTheDanceistheonlyworkinthecurrent\nshortlist created by a female artist.\nhe brainchild of American-born\nartist Liliane Lijn, The Dance would\ninvolve two identical aluminium\ncones powered by motors, their\nsections slowly moving and\nrotating towards and away from\neach other, as though dancing.\nhe faux-futuristic materials and slick\nspaceagedesignmakeitoddlybeautiful\nto watch these two beings engage with\neach other in such a peaceful way.\nBut there\u2019s some tricky logistics to\nconsider. For example, what happens\nwhen one cone inevitably breaks\ndown and \u2013 heaven forefend \u2013 the\nother ends up dancing on his own?\nGift Horse \u2013 Hans Haacke\nSome critics are calling GermanAmerican artist Hans Haacke\u2019s horse\nthe most suitable idea, as it references\nthe statue of William IV astride a\nhorse that was originally intended for\nthe fourth plinth all those years ago.\nMeanwhile the electronic ribbon\ntied in a bow around the horse\u2019s\nfront leg displays a live ticker of the\nLondon Stock Exchange, bringing the\nsculpture \ufb01rmly into the 21st century\nand turning it into a gift for the nation.\nHaacke\u2019s works are often political,\nas he examines the relationships\nbetween art, power and money in\nhis art. It seems this Gift Horse,\nwith the somewhat grave and\nlonely imagery, is no exception.\nUnmade Monument \u2013 Marcus Coates\nhe seemingly random rock\nformation proposed by Londoner\nMarcus Coates is in fact an exact\nreplica of a stone outcrop that the\nartist spotted in Yorkshire. he\noutcrop, formed over hundreds of\nmillions of years by natural processes,\nwould contrast with the rigid, manmade stone structures in the square.\nAlthough abstract, it is practically\nimpossiblenottoseefeaturesor\ufb01gures\nin the rock, as it is human nature to\nsearch for such patterns in an attempt\nto make sense of the natural disorder.\nhe sculpture would be a monument\nto creativity and power of nature,\noutside of a human context. Or\nperhaps it would just be a lump of rock.\nMoon Mask \u2013 Ugo Rondinone\n\u2018Our connection to other people is\nour face. Our alternate self is a mask\u2019,\nsays Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone.\nhat\u2019s why he proposes a giant mask,\nmodelled by hand, as a universally\nrecognisable icon for Trafalgar Square.\nhe mask is intentionally abstract\nand basic, with no speci\ufb01c cultural\nreferences or origins. Viewers are free\nto identify any artistic associations or\npersonal emotions in the mask\u2019s blank\nsteel face, from African tribal masks,\nto Cubist in\ufb02uences, to their own\nindividual projections, as they peer\nthrough the window-like apertures.\nHowever this simplicity is also\npossibly its greatest failing, as it may\nrender the structure bland, and rather\nuninteresting to view from behind.\nLarger Squat Afar \u2013 Mark Leckey\nFor Larger Squat Afar, Turner Prize\nwinner Mark Leckey has combined\naspects from across Trafalgar Square\nto make one single structural entity.\nDetails from the James II and Admiral\nJellico statues, the central fountain\nand the plinth itself have all been\nincorporated into the absurdist\ndesign. Even the title is actually\nan anagram of Trafalgar Square!\nLeckey has often used elements of\ncollageinhisartwork,butmoreusually\nin video and music installations.\nHowever here he has attempted to\ncreate an actual physical structure,\nthat is visually and emotionally\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\nWe will one day have\nto say goodbye to the\nbig blue cock currently\non display\nWe w\nWe will\nill one\none day\nday have\nhave\nto s\nto say g\nay goodb\noodbye t\nye to th\no the\ne\nbig\nbig blue\nblue coc\ncock cu\nk curren\nrrently\ntly\non d\non displ\nisplay\nay\n16 FRIDAY 04 OCT\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nEditor: Maciej\nMatuszewski, Eva\nRosenthal\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMaciej Matuszewski discusses an entertaining and interesting event\nSoho Literary Festival\nRather embarrassingly for the editor of the books\nsection, I had never before been to a literary festival.\nI therefore jumped at the opportunity to visit the Soho\nLiterary Festival, a small event being held, for the third\ntime in as many years, at the Soho heatre.\nHaving never really been that much into modern\nliterary \ufb01ction I stuck mainly with the more historical\nand political talks \u2013 see the other side of the page for\nmore detailed reviews of the events that I attended. he\nprogramme, however, had a far greater breadth \u2013 with\nevents ranging from Quentin Blake\u2019s talk on he Uses\nof Illustration to John Sweeny\u2019s investigation into the\nChurch of Scientology.\nI was greatly impressed by enthusiasm and eloquence\nof all the speakers. Most of the events that I attended\nwere packed with people and seemed to go down well\nwith the audience \u2013 I found them all both engaging and\ninformative.\nI am sure that the general atmosphere of this event\nwas very di\ufb00erent to that of larger literary festivals.\nhere were certainly fewer high pro\ufb01le guests and\nside events than at, say, Edinburgh or Hay-on-Wye.\nAn advantage, however, of being small is that Soho\nLiterary Festival was far friendlier and more intimate\nthan you would expect such an event to be. here was a\nvery refreshing air of informality and the speakers were\nmore than happy to mix with the audience in the bar\nbefore and after the talks.\nAll in all, this was a very pleasant experience \u2013 one\nthat I would be very keen to repeat next year.\nThe Age of Profumo: Sex, Class\nand Power\nPanel Chair: Piers Brendon\nPanelists: Richard Davenport-Hines and\nChristopher Hampton\nhe Profumo A\ufb00air is now regarded by\nmany as a little more than a historical foot-note. However, when it broke, the scandal\nhad a profound and long lasting e\ufb00ect on\nthe political establishment. In 1961 British War Secretary John Profumo began a\nsexual relation with the socialite \u2013 and alleged mistress of the Soviet spy Yevgeny\nIvanov \u2013 Christine Keeler. Profumo would\nlater explicitly deny the relationship before\nParliament but when the truth came out he\nwas forced to resign and the public\u2019s con\ufb01dence in the Conservative government was\nfatally wounded.\nhe panel discussion was a fascinating\nlook at the A\ufb00air. All of the participants\nwere keen to stress its importance \u2013 not\nonly in helping to bring down the beleaguered Conservative government, which\nhad already been weakened by the earlier\nSuez Crisis \u2013 but also as a start of a new,\nless deferential era towards the political\nestablishment. he discussion also pointed\nout parallels to contemporary events \u2013 both\npolice corruption and press sensationalism\ngreatly helped to exacerbate the A\ufb00air.\nhis was a fascinating panel \u2013 making an\nevent that took place long before I was born\nseem fascinating and relevant.\nThe History of Syria\nDan Snow\nTragic recent events have turned the eyes\nof the world on Syria. However, as historian Dan Snow \u2013 fresh from making a BBC\ndocumentary on the country \u2013 explained,\nthe roots of the con\ufb02ict are deep and com-plicated.\nSyria has always had an advantageous\ngeographic position. Boasting much fertile\nland and located at the crossroads of several\ntrade routes made it, for several millennia,\nan extremely rich land. However, this has\nled many empires to see the region a valuable prize \u2013 leading to much strife and political instability. he region has been ruled by\ncountless powers but Snow traced the most\nimmediate cause of the recent problems to\nthe British and French colonial e\ufb00orts in\nthe Middle East. Both countries deliberately created unstable conditions in the region\nto bene\ufb01t their own interests and, after de-colonisation, Syria was left with no legacy\nof self-governance or democracy \u2013 a recipe\nfor disaster.\nhis was a very complicated topic to cover in an hour and, by his own admission,\nDan Snow is not an expert in the region.\nHowever, in my opinion, he performed ad-mirably. he talk covered, in a clear man-ner, all the most important points of Syria\u2019s\nlong history. It gave me a new perspective\non the current con\ufb02ict and made me want\nto learn more.\nThe Classics Quiz\nQuestionmaster: William Fitzgerald\nTeam Captains: Harry Mount and Rachel\nJohnson\nI was somewhat apprehensive going in to\nthis event \u2013 having not studied Classics for\nover \ufb01ve years. And while it did turn out\nthat I had forgotten almost all of my GCSE\nLatin it was still a lot of fun, and probably\nthe best event that I attended at the Festival.\nhe quiz consisted of two teams of four\nanswering questions on the Latin language\nand ancient Roman history. It was, how-ever, a very informal a\ufb00air with wit, both\non the part of the questioner as well as the\ncontestants, counting for at least as much\nas the facts.\nA particular highlight was the Latin\nmotto\u2019s round, in which contestants were\nasked to identify, among others, the motto\nof Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; and in which I found out that the\nmotto of the Carlsberg Brewery is \u201claboremus pro patria\u201d \u2013 \u201clet us work for our\ncountry\u201d. Another highlight was the round\nasking contestants to identify the unpleasant means of death of Roman Emperors.\nWhile Rachel Johnson was unable to provide the answer to which Roman Emperor\nwas eaten by worms she was able to give\nthe Ancient Greek for the phrase \u201ceaten by\nworms\u201d.\nhis was a great event, reigniting, for one\nhour at least, my passion in the Classics.\nWant to see your name in print?\nSend your book reviews to books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNotes from my first\nliterary festival\n18 FRIDAY 04 OCT\n\n"

Wrong. Networking is all about\ncreating a mutually bene\ufb01cial web of\nrelationships, which is transparent,\nhonest and allows you to re\ufb01ne your\ncareer ideas and help you \ufb01nd suitable\nopportunities. Simply, it involves\ndeveloping your own personal\nbrand and raising your pro\ufb01le, and\nconnecting with professionals in your\n\ufb01eld of interest to learn more about\nyour sector, career paths, quali\ufb01cation\nroutes and potential vacancies.\nMake the most of campus events\nMaking contact and networking\nwith employers couldn\u2019t be easier\non campus, where a wide range\nof careers talks, skills sessions,\npresentations, fairs and forums are\norganised by the Careers Service on\na daily basis. Employers are actively\ntargeting and speci\ufb01cally interested\nin networking with Imperial students:\n\u2018Imperial is one of the top universities\nin the country, it makes sense to build\na relationship with students, go to the\ncareers fairs and presentations, where\nthose targeted group of students are\u2019\n(Luisa Dunn Graduate Recruitment\nat Cisco).\nIt is vital though that students\napproach employers in a way that is\nboth constructive and professional\nwhen attending a careers fair or forum:\n\u2018We recommend that students\ndo their research and find out\nwhat the companies do so you can\nspend your time wisely at the event\u2019\n(Emma Britton, Graduate\nRecruitment at Citi)\n\u2018It is imperative that you have\nquestions ready when networking so\nthat it is obvious to the employer that\nyou\u2019re interested\u2019\n(Steph Ahrens, Graduate Recruitment\nat Morgan Stanley)\nSo, think about the type of\ninformation and insights you\u2019re\nhoping to gain, as well as the\nimpression you want create. Plan\nyour questions in advance and make\nsure present yourself as professional,\ncon\ufb01dent, engaged and positive.\nIt pays to prepare\nAlways read the programme for an\nevent as soon as it is available, usually\na week before the event in hard copy\nor on the careers website. It will\nusually give you some background\ninformation on the companies\nattending,whattheydo,whatgraduates\nthey recruit and into which roles.\nIt is also a good idea to check out\ntheir website, especially their graduate\ncareers pages. When approaching a\ncompany representative at a fair it\ndoesn\u2019t give a great impression if your\nopening gambit is \u201cwhat does your firm\ndo?\u201d or \u201cso what kind of jobs do you\nhave?\u201d Getting this basic information\nin advance means that when you\ndo speak to the representatives\nyou can have a more meaningful\nconversation and come away with\nthe added detail to help you with\nany applications. his background\nresearch can also help you to decide\nwhich companies you really want to\ntarget. At very large events it may not\nbe possible to speak individually to\nevery company so a \u201chit list\u201d is a good\nidea so that you maximise the time.\nOn the day\n\u2022 Remember that \ufb01rst impressions\ncount.\n\u2022 hink of some questions that you\ncan ask the company representatives.\n\u2022 Avoid questions that you should\nalready know the answers to.\n\u2022 Remember the company\nrepresentatives are often recent\ngraduates themselves so now is the\nideal time to \ufb01nd out what their\nexperience has been so far, what the\ntraining programme was like, what\nsupport were they give, what is it\nreally like to do that role, work for\nthat company etc.\n\u2022 First impressions also include\nappearance so if you are serious about\na company or are in the middle of\nan application process with them\nit might pay to turn up at the fair\nlooking smart and presentable.\n\u2022 Remember fairs are not a\nuniversity version of a supermarket\nsweep. hey are not organised for\nyou to see how many freebies you can\ngrab in the shortest space of time.\n\u2022 Even if you haven\u2019t started to\nactively job hunt you will be surprised\nhow well recruiters remember names\nand faces.

Remember who got you that Lambourghini... -Ed.\nCareers Service\nImperial College\nAlumnus Profile\nWhat did your PhD involve?\nSimulations and R&D of a future project (cooling\nchannel of a Neutrino Factory). I had to learn many\ndi\ufb00erent programming languages and softwares. Also\nhad the chance to participate in other experiments (like\nMICE) that were ongoing and thus had the chance to\nparticipate in shifts and work on hardware, in addition to\ndata analysis\nDescribe the career path you took to your current\nrole.\nI had my BSci in Physics in Cyprus (that lasts four\nyears). For my \ufb01nal year project I was chosen to go to\nFermilab for a few months and worked on a particle\nphysics experiment (\ufb01nished the project back in Cyprus).\nI have no Masters. hen I applied for PhD\u2019s in the US/\nUK/Italy and chose to come to Imperial. here we (my\nclassmates and I) started with MPhil (6 \ufb01rst months,\nthis is why a Masters is not required) and then got into\nresearch. My research partially involved accelerator\nphysics and partially particle physics. Before the end of\nmy PhD I started applying for post-doc positions in the\nUS/UK/EU and was hired as a CERN fellow at CERN (i.e.\nI am not a\ufb03liated with any university). Here I work as an\naccelerator physicist on a future project called LAGUNALBNO (i.e. working on R&D and simulations) while at the\nsame time getting involved with other small projects that\nrequire me to do some shifts and data analysis.\nHow has what you learnt at Imperial helped you\nin your career so far?\nDuring my PhD at Imperial I learnt not to give up no\nmatter how hard a project seems/is; that I should keep\nworking until a problem is solved. My self-motivation\nskills were improved signi\ufb01cantly and this had a direct\nimpact at my work now; many times you feel you are at\na dead-end and you need to \ufb01nd ways to get out. Having\na PhD is completely di\ufb00erent than having a BSci. You\nare required to work alone, to come up with ideas, to\nbe motivated and organised without necessarily having\nsomeone telling you what to do. You don\u2019t have one text\nbook that you have to study from in order to do well at\nthe exams. You have to think on your own what steps are\nneeded to \ufb01nd the solution to a problem that has not been\nencountered before. he PhD experience in total was very\nbene\ufb01cial as it helps you become stronger, work well as\na team-member and deliver what you are required to by\na speci\ufb01c deadline. What I learnt that has been the most\nuseful to me is that no matter how di\ufb03cult things seem to\nbe, you have to keep swimming with the head outside the\nwater and you will (sooner or later) \ufb01nd the shore (or a\nrock to relax for a bit before starting to swim again).\nDr. Androula Alekou, Physics PhD\nAccelerator Physicist at CERN\nthe sense of working towards a\ngreater understanding of the world,\nempowering other students and\nallowing people to create bonds\nacross international boundaries\nis what makes it worthwhile.\nTo get involved, contact one of the\nUK Local Committees:\nLondon and England\n(info@iaestelondon.org.uk)\nWales\n(info@iaestelondon.org.uk)\nGlasgow and Scotland\n(info@IAESTEGlasgow.co.uk)\nEdinburgh\n(abi.johnston@iaeste-edinburgh.\nco.uk)\nBelfast and Northern Ireland\n(iaesteni.lc@gmail.com)\nVisit www.iaestelondon.org.uk and\n\ufb01nd out how to join our Welcome\nEvent at the beginning of the new\nacademic year.\nFor more information on the IAESTE\nprogramme, both if you are a student\nor an employer you can also contact:\niaeste@britishcouncil.org\nIAESTE LONDON\nIf you would like\nto \ufb01nd out more\nabout IAESTE\u02bcs paid\ninternships why not\ngo to their London\nwelcome event this\nSunday (6th Oct)?\nDetails available online.\n\u201cDid you\nknow that\nIAESTE was\nfounded at\nImperial in\n1948 as oart\nof a postwar effort to\npromote culture\nand learning\nexchanges\nbetween\nuniversities?\u201d\n\u201cIAESTE has\nexchanged\nover 300,000\nstudents in\nmore than 80\ncountrries\u201d\n\n"

Help\nan Editor out, yo!\nhe fa\ufb04ess foursome (Alby, Tom,\nReece and Patrick S.) had arrived in\nBovec at 2PM and had already proceeded to buy beers and paddling per-mits, paddle a grade 3 river, and make\na start on the \ufb01rst and certainly not\nlast conspicuous looking meal, just\nin time for the minibus to arrive later\nthat night.\nhe next few days in the beautiful\nSoca valley of Slovenia were savoured\nby all, as they brought a real relaxation and joy to some of the kayaking\nthat would ensue. On day 2, a four\nman mission to take on a section of\nthe river the locals regarded as deadly,\nCanoe Club Summer Tour\ntravels to 3 countries\nICU CANOE CLUB\nPresident Reece Blunt reveals all\ngave us our \ufb01rst chance to see what\nthese parts of Europe had to o\ufb00er, and\nnotably this early success had to have\nrepercussions, as only later that day, a\nbandy group of wanderers went loco\nand walked several kilometres down a\nroad, notably never heading towards\nthe river. When we had \ufb01nally reunit-ed, carnage commenced, and alongside early face plants, we also managed longs swims of rapids (Helen)\nand not one but two losses of paddles,\nwhich inevitably meant more swims\nfurther down.\nBefore heading o\ufb00 on leg two of\nour adventure, it has to be noted Jake\nReynolds had an awful time caught\non a branch underwater after he\nswam, and our e\ufb00orts on rescuing him\nseemed to cause more distress, until,\nman of the hour, Alby Roseveare live\nbaited himself out to perform a res-cue. I myself can\u2019t wait for the GoPro\nfootage.\nWe left Slovenia with warmth in\nour hearts, with its only setbacks the\nlanguage barrier, and its odd choice in\nroad signs. On arrival in the Isel valley in Sud Tirol in Austria, a surreal\nencounter with the campsite owner\nwho was clad in lederhosen, red faced\nand stumbling around with alcohol\non his breath lead to a great camping\ndeal being struck. his also marked\nthe welcome arrival of the Clissold\u2019s.\nIt was July the 4th, and an overly patriotic Joe Bibby seemed to be the only\none in the party mood as his annual\ncelebrations began. Not forgetting his\nYeti costume. he next day can only be\ndescribed as one of the most exciting\nof the tour for most people, since it\nwas their \ufb01rst experience of the truly\nbig and bouncy white water that this\npart of the world is known for.\nAfter another day of boating and ad-venture, the car of Alby, Ally, Rachel\nand Rik, came across the minibus left\nvulnerable to attack in the car park of\na Spar, seeing that the only sensible\nthing to do would be to use their spare\nkeys to manoeuvre it to another more\nsuitable location, a marvellous joke\nthat left half the club in tatters, others\nin stitches, and the local Police laughing and mocking us in their native\ntongue, after it had eventually been\nfound. We moved to the Innsbruck\narea to paddle the well-known section\nof the Inn, the Imst gorge and other\ntributaries, but left after two short\nnights after \ufb01nding it not very viable\nfor club paddling.\nWe drove to Switzerland where we\ncame to a crossroads in our journey,\nwith the minibus preparing for its \ufb01nal few days in the Alps, and Messrs,\nRalph Evins and Alex Robinson coming out to meet us for the extra week\nof gnarl that was set to follow.\nEngadine, an area \ufb01lled with gorgeous gorges of di\ufb00ering variety, was\nthe scene for the end of the trip, and\nboy did it deliver. An epic adventure\ndown the 4+/5 graded Giarsun Gorge\nset the mark for some of the most\ncommitting rapids the country has to\no\ufb00er, followed by the S-Chamf Gorge\npast the campsite, a stunningly scenic\ngorge with technical rapids, and beautiful overhead rocks, before our \ufb01nal\nsection on the Schuls section of the\nInn. With some short grade 4 rapids\ndotted throughout before a \ufb01nal serious grade 4 rapid \u2018against the wall\u2019 that\ndemonstrated a real testament to club\npaddling, and showed how ICCC once\nagain pushes the boundaries.

To make up this\nde\ufb01cit, they put forward a proposal\nto build a 700-bed accommodation-only campus in North Acton, which is\na 40 minute commute each way from\nSouth Kensington.\nhe College claimed that it would\ncost around \u00a310 million to refurbish\nthe hall for students, and thus the\nconversion into a care home was more\n\ufb01nancially viable. It is well known\nthat Fisher Halls\u2019 current state is less\nthan adequate and could be seen as\nunsuitable for the elderly and disabled.\nhe director of Campus Services,\nJane Neary, told Felix in 2011 that\nthe reason for the closure was \u2018not\nthat [the hall isn\u2019t] good enough, it\u2019s\ncompletely legal [in terms of upkeep]\u2019,\nadding that \u2018we\u2019ve done all the urgent\nwork\u2019.\nUpon inspection by an Imperial\nstudent, it was noted that there was\na large area of exposed wiring on\none of the stairwells. A large number\nof electrical components did not\nappear to have been tested in line\nwith these regulations. he testing\ncerti\ufb01cates indicated that they were\ndue for testing in August 2012, but as\nof June 2013, the certi\ufb01cates had not\nbeen replaced. Some appliances were\nthree years past their due date. he\ncollege states that \u201call college owned\nappliances are tested annually and all\nwiring is tested every \ufb01ve years\u201d.\nAsbestos is another concern in\nFisher hall. A second year Physicist\nexplains that he is uncomfortable with\nthe asbestos-\ufb01lled \ufb01re doors. \u201cYou\npush them and they bang against the\nwall and then hit you in the face\u201d he\nsays, explaining that he\u2019s not sure that\nBen Fernando\nReporter\nThe expiry date is older than the milk in the fridge of Felix Of\ufb01ce\nthe asbestos is safe in doors which\nreceive such strong knocks and are\ndamaged in places.\nIn addition, the lack of central\nheating means that many of the\nrooms are heated with wall-mounted\nfan heaters, which are past their PAT\nThis looks quite like the inside of an Imperial engineer\u02bcs brain\n\u2018The Jail\u2019 halls get secret inspection\nAemun Reza\nNews Editor\n70m from South Kensington tube\nBEN FERNANDO\nBEN FERNANDO\nMaybe the engineers were too busy volunteering at the Olympics?\nBEN FERNANDO\nnot currently unsafe despite the date\nhaving passed. All circuits and fuse\nboards are scheduled to be tested this\nterm, and any remedial work will be\ncarried out as required.\nFixed appliance testing was carried\nout in Fisher hall in September 2012,\nincluding on the wall mounted heaters shown in picture 2. he next test\nis due later this month. It appears that\nthe heaters have not been stickered\ncorrectly. Imperial\u2019s electrical contractors now tend to keep electronic\nrecords/registers rather than apply\nstickers, which tend to fall o\ufb00. he\naccommodation team should have arranged for old stickers to be removed,\nhowever.\nhere were a number of telephone\njunction boxes in the Hall that are redundant (photo 6). hese have already\nbeen removed or are in the process of\nbeing removed, as per picture 4.\nDamage to the window frame pictured is due to condensation. Accommodation sta\ufb00 continue to monitor\nthe situation and students with any\nconcerns can contact their Hall Supervisor if they have any concerns.\nSimilarly damage to the ceiling, as\nshown in one of the photographs, was\ndue to a defect on the roof, allowing\nwater through. hat defect has been\n\ufb01xed, the peeling paint removed and\nthe accommodation team are closely\nmonitoring it.\nCollege Spokesperson\ntesting date. hey become extremely\nhot to the touch and when left on,\nsmell distinctly smoky and are even\nreported to have set o\ufb00 the \ufb01re\nalarms.

She stated\nthat they were \u2018very dangerous\u2019 and\n\u2018must be removed immediately\u2019. All\nother serious issues with the room\nwent by unnoticed.\nIn addition to not adhering to the\ncollege\u2019s promises on electrical safety,\nFisher Hall currently presents a poorly\nkept environment for students to live\nin and is a completely di\ufb00erent image\nfrom the immaculate rooms in Prince\u2019s\nGardens that are shown to prospective\nstudents on Open Days.\n(As of June 2013)\nUpdate from Campus Services\nhe College routinely carries out\nmaintenance to ensure students\u2019 accommodation meets required safety\nstandards.\nUpdates on some of the issues identi\ufb01ed in the photographs:\nhe date shown on the 2012 sticker is a recommended timeframe.

    "content": "TRAVEL\nEditor: Chris\nRichardson\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28 FRIDAY 04 OCT\nSome guys just can\u2019t handle La Paz\nB\nolivia isn\u2019t exactly a\nfresh addition to the\nLatin American gringo\ntrail \u2013 it features heavily\nin countless itineraries\n(indeed, I even ran into an old Felix\neditor whilst there) \u2013 yet it\u2019s managed\nto retain an essence of individuality\nwhilst neighbouring countries have\nstarted to subside. he population of\nthe entire country is barely larger than\nLondon\u2019s, with 60% of the population\ncalling themselves indigenous: it is a\nvibrant place bursting with culture\nand epic, Martian landscapes.\nClose to the northern border with\nPeru sits La Paz, the world\u2019s highest\nadministrative capital. he city is\nsituated in a crater, the surrounding\nhills of which are sprinkled with\nsuburban dwellings, and framed\nby massive, snow-capped peaks,\nwhich one can climb if one is so\ninclined. As with most cities, La Paz\ngets an incredible range of reviews,\ndepending on who you\u2019re asking, and\nhow bad the weather was when they\nwere visiting. Personally, I found that\nit sucked me in, until I eventually had\nto throw myself on a bus just to get\nout and see more of the continent.\nA discussion of the city would be\nimpossible without at least a passing\nreference to cocaine. San Pedro\nPrison, situated in a beautiful plaza in\nthe centre of the city, rose to notoriety\nthanks to Rusty Young\u2019s book\nMarching Powder, which outlines the\nlife of convicted trafficker homas\nMcFadden, highlighting the extreme\nlevels of corruption, as illustrated\nby the fact that he was able to o\ufb00er\ntourists excursions inside the jail.\nMore recently, Route 36 has been\ndubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s \ufb01rst cocaine\nbar\u201d, allegedly o\ufb00ering backpackers\nthe sort of service you could expect\nfrom any of the pretentious west\nend London clubs, but with even\nmore cocaine. But one would hope\nthat for the seasoned traveller, the\nendless legitimate attractions on o\ufb00er\nwould be incentive enough to visit.\nU\nrban Rush\nI feel obligated to go\nbeyond a glowing TripAdvisor review\nand give the guys at Urban Rush a\nspecial mention here. If you\u2019re in\nthe neighbourhood, put this on your\nto-do list. And if you\u2019re not in the\nneighbourhood, get rerouting. he\nconcept of Urban Rush is simple: dress\nupinaridiculouscostume,clipyourself\nto a rope, and throw yourself face \ufb01rst\nfrom a seventeen storey building. he\nowners assure me that nobody has\nsustained any injuries to date, but I\u2019d\nhighly recommend getting your eight\nhours before giving this one a go.\nhe costumes on o\ufb00er cater to most\ntastes, whether you fancy yourself as\nSpider-Man or a deranged patient\nfrom Amityville, but if you\u2019re not\n\ufb01xated on travelling light you could\neven pack your own and add a bit of\nvariety to your photos. After a quick\nbut informative training session,\nyou suddenly \ufb01nd yourself dangling\nfrom the building, about to embark\non your forward-facing abseil. And\nwhen you get to the tenth storey,\nit\u2019s time to leap out from the wall\nand let go of the rope, putting your\nlife in the hands of a stranger as\nyour plummet to your death. he\nsensation is pretty bizarre, but it\u2019s\nperfectly safe and makes for some\npretty sweet photos (as well as boring\nstories to share with strangers in the\nsmoking area of your next night out).\nT\nhe death\nroad\nOf course, no trip would be\ncomplete without mountain biking\ndown the world\u2019s most dangerous\nroad. Dubbed so because of the\nhundreds of travellers who would\nfall and die annually whilst using\nthe road, it now mostly serves as a\ntourist attraction that still has its\nfair share of fatalities, which is why\nagain it\u2019s important to get your eight\nhours, and even more important to\nidentify a reputable company with\nsolid equipment that won\u2019t fail you\nas you zip along the cli\ufb00\u2019s edges.\nhe whole trip takes a day, starting\nwith an early morning bus ride that\ndumps you at the top of a huge,\ncontinuous downhill stretch that\nbegins in the cooler altiplano before\ndescending into rainforest. he\nmajority of the route is single-lane,\nand runs alongside drops of hundreds\nof metres, all without the protection\nof guardrails. hat said, most people\nwho avoid excessive recklessness\nmanage to complete the route without\nas much as a graze. Most tours\nconclude at Senda Verde, an animal\nrefuge where volunteers can work\nwith a variety of animals including\nseveral species of monkey, and/or\na booze-fuelled pool party where\nrevellers bask in the fact that they\u2019ve\nactually managed to survive the day.\nH\nuayna\nPotosi\nIf jumping out of buildings or\ndownhill biking isn\u2019t your sort of\nthing, then you probably won\u2019t be\nkeen to tackle Huayna Potosi, the\n6110 metre mountain situated just\nnorth of the city. he peak has been\ndubbed \u201cthe easiest 6000er in the\nworld\u201d: not a re\ufb02ection of a lack of\ntechnical difficulty, but due to the ease\nof acclimatisation thanks to La Paz\u2019s\nstaggering altitude. In any case, it\u2019s\ncertainly not for the faint-hearted. he\nonly reason I bothered was because I\nwas waiting on a custom-made leather\njacket from the blue market and had\nthree days to kill. Not that I regret it,\nbut I de\ufb01nitely should have looked\ninto what it entailed a little more.\nhe entire excursion takes three\ndays. Day one is strictly for training:\ngetting accustomed to using your\ncrampons and pickaxe on a glacier\nclose to the lower base camp. Day\ntwo involves lugging all of your\nequipment (travel light) to the upper\nbase camp in time for sleeping at\nthe upper base camp at 6 p.m. Day\nthree begins at midnight, when\nyou wake up and climb in order to\nsummit for sunrise. he views were\nspectacular, and there\u2019s a certain\ncredibility about completing a 6000\nmetre peak at a time when too many\npeople are raving about Kilimanjaro.\nS\ntannum\nBoutique\nHotel\nOne of the fantastic perks of visiting\nan up-and-coming destination like\nLa Paz is that there are still priceless\ngems to be found at ridiculous prices.\nForget the hustle and bustle of the\ncity\u2019s dingier hostels and opt for\nStannum. Despite being in its infancy\nit\u2019s already the top rated hideaway\non TripAdvisor, and boasts elegant\ncontemporary design combined\nwith classical details, not to mention\noutrageous views over the beautiful\ncity from its endless glass panels.\nhe rooms are comfortable, the sta\ufb00\nare friendly, and the bartenders serve\nup some truly lethal concoctions\n(especially at that price). Check out\nstannumhotels.com for more details.\nLa Paz rocks. Too many people\nmarginalise it as a stopover between\nUyuni\u2019s salt \ufb02ats and darkest Peru, but\nit\u2019s great in its own right. Admittedly\nthe handful of activities described\nhere are a limited selection: I haven\u2019t\neven discussed the colourful markets\no\ufb00ering everything from high\nquality crafts to llama foetuses, or\nthe availability of Michellin-starred\nrestaurants that\u2019ll set you back as\nmuch as an Orange Wednesday at\nPizza Express.

    "content": "GAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 FRIDAY 04 OCT\nCalum Skene\nGames Editor\nFor a long time Awesomenauts had a\nlonely existence in my Steam library.\nI picked it up in a sale and then there\nit sat unplayed. One day prompted\nby fellow editor Max I \ufb01nally played\nit and realised the mistake I had\nmade! Straight from the opening\ntitles I knew I would love this game\nso sit tight for my \u201cAWESOME!\nAWESOME! AWESOME!\u201d review.\nAwesomenauts is a side-scrolling\nmultiplayer battle game developed\nand published by Ronimo games.\nhis is a game unlike any I have\nplayed before, but immediately I\nam a fan. he premise is that you\nare a mercenary hired by a drilling\ncompany to mine solar. However\nanother drilling company has also\nhired mercenaries so it quickly\nescalates into a battle for control. It\ncombines strategy with some real\ntime \ufb01ghts, and does so successively.\nThis side-scolling sci-fi adventure shooter is amazeballs!\nIn each battle the goal is to destroy the\nturrets of the other team, with your\n3 teammates, while defending your\nturrets. Drones are also spawned to\nhelp you out. As you destroy and kill\nthe other team you will earn solar\nwhich you can use to upgrade your\ncharacter. Once the turrets have\nbeen destroyed you work to destroy\nthe drill core of the other team\nwhich wins the game for your team.\nhere is a short tutorial which\nteaches you the basics, after that you\ncan choose to play against AI, but the\nreal fun is online. Finding a game is\nshort! I hardly had to wait anytime at\nall. he game gives you a lot of options\nfor personalisation. From choosing\nyour character (and skins that you\ncan purchase for them) to special\nabilities you will be able to spend solar\non in the game you can really \ufb01nd\nthat perfect combination that works\nfor you. Completing games earns\nyou XP which enables you to level\nup which unlocks more characters,\noptions for your characters and\nmaps. his helps you to not feel\noverwhelmed at the beginning by all\nthe options. As you learn by playing\ngames you also get better characters\nand more options. Besides all this\nlevelling up is always a satisfying\nexperience. Visually Awesomenauts\nis a very pretty cartoony game. he\nmusic, also great, helps to give it\na kids TV battle programme kind\nof theme which really works well!\nWhere this game really stood\nout for me was playing with your\nfriends. hree people on each team\nmeans you can easily get two other\npeople to game with you and this will\nprovide hours of fun. I enjoyed a very\neventful session of being shouted at\non Skype, sadly a game experience\nI am used to when playing with this\nparticular friend, while being killed\nin increasingly embarrassing ways.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you are\nwinning or losing, Awesomenauts\nis always hilarious. Even when my\nkeyboard broke I was able to keep\nplaying thanks to the controller\nsupport. Playing with a controller\nis intuitive and easy despite the fact\nthat aiming is done with the same\ncontrols as walking. I\u2019m not usually\na fan of multiplayer battle games but\nAwesomenauts is both casual enough\nfor me and competitive enough for my\ncritical friend that we both enjoyed it.\nI would recommend this game to\nanyone who wants a fun multiplayer\nexperience. It\u2019s a great game to have\nfor just killing 30 minutes here and\nthere or for an evening of fun. For\nthe price of \u00a36.99 this game is a steal!\nWin something\nFelix Games has 2 copies of\nthis game, so do you want to\nwin a copy of Awesomenauts\nfor yourself? Describe in 300\nwords your most interesting\ngame experience of the\nsummer. Send it in to games.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk and get\nyourself published as well!\nFelix Games Team\nEvery so often a steam discount/sale\ncomes along and I see a game for a\nprice I cannot refuse. Surprisingly\nenough this happens more than I\nwish it would, and so I end up with\na boatload of games that I have\nabsolutely no time or energy to spend\non them. Game Dev Tycoon was one\nof these games. An absolute bargain at\nthe time (\u00a37), I had seen lots about this\ngame on the internet and so I decided\nto buy it. However it was lying around\nin my library for about a week before\nI even had the chance to start it up.\nGame Dev Tycoon is a indie game\ncreated by Greenheart Games last\nyear, and revolves around you creating\na successful games studio. Starting\nout in your parents garage in the 80s\nit is your mission to make a successful\ncompany that can withstand pretty\nmuch anything. Pretty much\neverything is up to your imagination,\nyou can name your company, the\ngames you want to develop, etc.\nhe gameplay itself is very simple\nand intuitive. I did not need any sort\nof tutorial to \ufb01gure out what was going\non from the start. he game creating\nMax Eggl discovers that, woah, he can totally develop games\nprocess is very clear and enjoyable.\nYou basically just click on your sitting\nguy, get some options and then choose\nfrom those options. You can choose\nanything from the name to the layout\nof the quests for your game. his lead\nme to create some really hilarious\ngames (e.g. A time travelling adventure\ncalled \u201cSave Jesus\u201d, for some reason it\nbombed...I still haven\u2019t \ufb01gured out\nwhy!). Furthermore this complete\nmodi\ufb01ability allows for a lot of replay\nvalue, for if you want to go through\neach di\ufb00erent combination (let\nalone come up with names) it\nwill take you a very long time!\nhe \u201cstory\u201d, if I may call it\nsuch, is quite immersive\nand the releases of actual\nreal consoles over the\nyears really does make\nit feel like you are a\ngame developer who\nis struggling to make a\nmark. he progression\nof research is also brilliant,\nas it makes you work for\nsomething as well as allowing\nfor a goal. I mean the moment you\nare able to release your own console\nafter your h u m b l e\nbeginnings is one of the most\nsatisfying things I did!\nI do have to say though that the\nreviewers criticism seems a bit\nrandom, in the sense that I had two\ngames with all the same options\nhowever one bombed, and one\nsucceeded. here was only minimal\nvariation between the two and yet they\napparently totally di\ufb00er in success.\nHowever once I checked out the wiki\n(there is an entire wiki!), it made a\nbit more sense to me. here are\nsome neat algorithms behind\nthe reviewing process.\nHowever since this game\nis quite repetitive, in the\nsense that you are pretty\nmuch doing the same\nthing over and over\nagain, I can see a\nlimited amount\nof hours that you\ncan pour into it.\nFurthermore with\nno updates or DLC\nplanned, the original is\nwhat you are stuck with.\nherefore I don\u2019t see myself pushing\n20 hours, if even that. However\nconsidering the price I paid for the\ngame, it was completely worth it.\nhe graphics of this game are quirky\nand cartoony, meaning that while you\nwillnotseeanythingthatwillblowyour\nmind, it will run pretty much on any\ncomputer without any problems or lag.\nOn a positive note, this game runs on\nPCandMacandisavailableonsteam,so\nit easily accessible and downloadable.\nIt seems that Felix Games editors\nfall to the curse of the indie game\naddiction, and I can already see the\n\ufb01rst symptoms. his is already my\nsecond indie game review, and to my\ndismay I am hoping it is not my last.\nIndie games like this blow originality\nand new ideas into this stagnating\n\ufb01eld, where only certain formulas\nseem to be released annually. Anyway,\nif you are a fan of the indie game\ncommunity check it out. Otherwise,\nhave a look anyway and you may be\npleasantly surprised! I mean, when\nare you ever going to get the chance to\ncreate a game, name it whatever you\nwant (and I mean WHATEVER you\nwant) see it become ultra successful?\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny h\nh\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\nb\nb\nb\nb\ns\ns\nt\ns\ns\ns\nm\nm\na\na\nl\nl\nl\np\nAwesomenauts!
