Unfortunately with DJ'ing\nbecoming everyone's favourite past-time, many forget this. There are\nthose into the scene who play out\nand aim to do as many events in a night as possible.\nNowadays, with the amount of\ncompilations coming out, there's little or no chance of finding a top quality house compilation. That's why when I first heard this I had to listen to it again and again. The\nDistinctive Sound Of House Vol.2 is\nan outstanding 2 x CD package\nwhich covers all genres of what used\nto be called House.\nCD1. Concentrates on the\nbassi er, lighter sounds of both UK\nand \"speed\" Garage, with Housey\nmore familiar beats coming a little\nlater. Huff ' n' Puff's Help Me Make It, along with Din DaDa by Kevin\nAviance starts the epic combination,\nfunky Garage beats with catchy\nlyrics. The bassline soon comes in,\nand the beats continue to roll on in\nthe form of the Headcrash's Give It\nTo Me, and Hyper's Go Go, both\nabsolutely banging tunes, well worth\na place on this CD. Then Dj Supreme Tha Wildstyle\nis probably the weakest tune on here, but it dose what is needed to\nchange the flavour from Garage to\nHouse. The House featured here is\nnot the cheese y Pete (can't be bothered (or just can't) mix) Tong, radio\n1 style, but the form which house\ntook up before commercialism.\nAdeva's Don't think about it gets\nplayed twice, with the Nu Birth\nVocal mix being the harder, reflecting the change of pace.\nCD2. Carries on where the previous hour left off, with P.O.W by\nMike Crawley. The first few tunes on\nthis CD have a fair amount of catchy\nlyrical content which combines with\nthe familiar hard house beats. Hot\nShot 9 7 ' by Karen Young has an old\nskool feel to it, and is probably the\nlast breather you'll get before the\nfinal half hour kicks in with an extravaganza of fast, hard, house beats.\nWalk with me by Helicopter combines a massive breakdown with\nover seven minutes of pure sex, in\nmusical terms of course.\nAll in all this compilation contains 24 top quality tunes, truly capturing what is happening in club land\nall expertly &. seamless mixed\ntogether by Richard Ford, a man\nwho been on the scene for longer\nthan most of us new it existed.\nThose lovely people at Phuture\nTrax have some copies of the compilation & some T shirts to give\naway, can't be bad.\nThe three first people to drop\nname and contact no into Felix\noffice will win.

    "content": "NEWS 23 January 1998\nDrug Problems forLi nste acf Warden NEWS TEAM\nMonday night saw yet another\ndrugs related incident in Linstead\nHall. At around midnight security\nguards were alerted after a smoke\nalarm was activated in a stu-dent's room.\nFelix was told that security\nentered the room and found what\nwas later claimed by security to be\ncannabis. Security was also alleged\nto have had trouble opening the\ndoor, and accused the room's occupants of barricading the\nentrance. According to one of the\nstudents there were six people in\nthe room at the time, including one\nre-app and one non-Imperial stu-dent. The students neither confirmed nor denied that they were\nsmoking cannabis - two of them\nhave also claimed that they were\ntoo drunk to notice what was going\non. After entering the room, the\nguards noticed the smell of\ncannabis, although the students\nclaim that they didn't notice for \"a couple of minutes\". One of the students indignantly complained that\nhe were subjected to an intrusive\nand intimate search, to which he\nhad not given consent. Keith\nReynolds, Imperial College's Head\nof Security confirmed that a guard\nmust obtain consent in such a situ-ation. All students were searched,\nwith protocol forcing a female\nmember of security staff being\nbrought over to assist with a suspected woman. One of those present alleged no evidence was found\non any suspect, although one of the\nsecurity staff found minute traces\nof what was claimed to be cannabis\nin a \"mix\" with tobacco which had\nbeen swept to the floor. The students have been told to expect a disciplinary hearing, although the\ncharges against them have yet to be\nrevealed. IC Security said that they\nwere unable to comment further on\nthe matter, saying that the incident\nwas now being looked into by col-leg e. This is the second time in a month that Linstead residents have\nbeen involved in a drugs scandal.\nDecember saw two students fined\n\u00a3 7 5 each for smoking cannabis.\nWhen asked if he was alarmed at\nthe apparent increase in drug abuse\nwithin Linstead, the Assistant\nWarden, Mr. Richard Hamilton,\ndeclined to comment, stating only\nthat \"the law is the law\".\nALong Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far, FarAway... DAVID ROBERTS\nThe government of Imperial is to\nundergo a radical shake-up next\nterm under plans announced by\nthe governing body.\nFor the first time ever student\nrepresentatives will be given a vote\nat the highest levels of College\nadministration, bringing IC in line\nwith most other universities in the\nUK, a move described by ICU\nPresident Andy He eps as \"Excellent\nnews\".\nThe sovereign body of College\nwill become the \"Imperial Court\", a much larger version of the present\nGoverning Body, which will meet\nonce a year (as opposed to the\npresent six). Included in the membership of this body will be seven\nvoting members from ICU - the\nPresident and Deputy Presidents of\nthe Union, and the four Constituent\nCollege Union Presidents.\nMost decisions will then be\ndevolved down to the much smaller \"Imperial Council\", which would\nbe equivalent to the present IC\nExecutive. Again, this will contain\nstudents as voting members for the\nfirst time, which will allow the two\nrepresentatives - the ICU President\nand DP(F&5) to table motions and\nspeak on all issues (although only\nthe President will have a vote).\nFinally, the \"Imperial Senate\"\nwill replace the Board of Studies,\ncontinuing to include the President\nand two other students amongst\nits number.\nNews in Brief. LETTER OF FATE On the weekend of 10 and 1 1\nJanuary, 120 members of the college were anonymously sent malicious chain e mail. The message,\nentitled 'Letter of Fate' told recipients to forward the e mail on to\nfive others within three days to\navoid bad luck, a common ploy\nused by internet 'spammers' to\nspread junk mail. Prof. R.J. Hynds, Head of the Centre for\nComputing Services, explained\nthat most of the recipients' e mail\naddresses could have been\nextracted from legitimate mailing\nlists managed by the CCS. Investigating the logs of electronic requests for the addresses and\ncollaborating with AOL, the CCS have managed to narrow down this spammer to only a few sus-pec ts. The CCS, collaborating with\nU KERN A, who manages links\nbetween UK university networks,\nhave since restricted the requests\nfor addresses to combat future\nmalicious mailers.\nLOW PAY LEVELS Academic salaries have hit an\n18-year low, according to the\nAssociation of University\nTeachers. In a speech yesterday\nAUT President Penny Holloway\nsaid that the last three years had\nseen inflation go up by 9.2% but\nHigher Education staff wages\nincreased by only 8.7%. \"Nowhere\nelse in the UK economy... has\nsuffered a more consistent downward pressure on costs,\" she\nadded. She cited the increased\nstaff workload, such as administering tuition fees, encouraging\nwider access to HE, and the continuing cuts that the sector has\nhad to face. Laura Barker,\nGeology Department librarian and\na member of the AUT National\nExecutive, added, \"The level of\nsalaries are scandalous... there's been a massive increase in pro-duct iv it y. There does seem to be\na blinding lack of appreciation of\neducation, education and e duca tion.\"\nSABBATICAL ELECTION JOY Papers will go up on Monday for this year's round of sabbatical\nelections. Four posts are up for\ngrabs - President, Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services),\nDeputy President (Clubs &.\nSocieties) and Felix Editor. The\nposts will be of a year's duration\nstarting next July. Each candidate\nrequires twenty second ers and\ncan sign up on the notice board\noutside the Union Office. Anyone\ninterested is welcome to speak to\nthe current incumbents.\nKuntinee Maneeratana, a Mechanical Engineering post grad, has won\na computer in a competition organised over the web. Dave Mutton\nand Emma Warner of the Internet Bookshop (IBS), presented her with\nthe prize in dB's last Tuesday. \"We have competitions all the time,\nand this time Kuntinee was our lucky winner,\" said Ms. Warner. Ms.\nManeeratana, who entered the competition after buying books from\nIBS, said, \"It was great...I 've never won any prizes before.\" IBS can be\nvisited on www.bookshop.co.uk.\n\n"

Marco reluctantly stood upland took the\nspade off Dan. \"Explain it^Jgaia, J M,\" he said as\nhe started to dig.\nZed brightened up i^ B^|iM ely and adjusted his glasses again. \" Look it's quite simple. You\ntake a ball made of glass and then you coat the\ninside of it with the stuff they use to make one\nway mirrors. Then you\"\" How would you do that?\" Asked Marco, looking across at Dan.\n\"I don't know, but I 'll think of a way.\nAnyway, you coat it with this stuff entirely and\nthat would mean that you' d be able to look into\nthe ball but not out. Then, you take a torch and you shine it in.\" \"So what?\"\n\"Well, the light would go into the ball,\nbecause of it being a one way mirror, but it\nwouldn't get back out. It would just be reflected,\nagain and again and again.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"Don't you understand? You would still be\nable to look into the ball, and you' d see the light,\nbut the light would never get out. It would just\ncarry on glowing and glowing.\" \"Look, Zed,\" said Dan,\"1 asked my father\nabout it and he said it couldn't work. He should\nknow.\"\n\" Oh God, it's Plug,\" interrupted Marco sud-den ly. Dan and Zed both turned round to look in\nthe direction he was pointing. A young man was front of him with an expr ej pPl i of*g1f et ration q jR go J ted up at^ jpl rf and a foolish gr irt split his face. H<' waved. Reluctantly Marco, Zed, and Dan waved back.\n\" now the hell J fid he In T M\"^rt fr here?\"\nHissed Dan.

Dan's mother, who was a nurse, had told them that he\nhad a mental age of ft ve js All. of their parent's had\ntold them that if they ever made fun of him there would be severe trouble. Ron's physical\nage was IB and he was heavily built. He was six\nfeet five tall and had very%|bard: shoulders!,He,\ncould have looked quite intimidating if his\nmouth wasn't almost perpetually open revealing\na line of very crooked teeth. His hair was scraped across his head from a parting that was| barely an inch away from his right ear. \"Daniel,\nyour mother said where you are and said I could\nhelp you,\" he said hopefully.\n\" Oh,\" said Dan.\n\"Sure you can help,\" said\"N&rc J jP& re need\nsomeone strong like you.\" Ron grinned again and for a moment it\nseemed like he would clap his h|fl g \u00a3 r le didn't but instead asked what they were doing.\nZed explained that they were digging four\nholes to put four posts into. The posts would\nbecome the corners of their hut. He showed\nRon the one hole that had the big stone in it that\nthey couldn't move. They were intending to get\na crowbar to move it later. \"Or maybe you could\nmove it?\" asked Dan.\nRon's face became very serious and it\nlooked as if he was in deep thought. \"1 think I can move it,\" he said after a long while just as\nDan was about to make a comment. He slowly\nand precisely rolled up both the sleeves of his\ntrack suit top and then got onto his knees. Dan\nnoticed that he had perfectly manicured fingernails and felt a twinge of shame; Almost automatically he clenched his own hands to hide his\nown fingernails which were brutally short and\nragged. He had bitten them from a very early\nage but ha his life w out it until\nthis mm cn t.He was surprised to find that he\n^ ft' af j^r^^^ fe irn self.

Ron's face turned red and his whole body\nbegan to quiver. Then, quite suddenly, with a kind of ripping sound the rock came upwards\ntaking a large chunk of the earth and grass with\n\" Awesome,\" exclaimed Dan, putting a lingering emphasis on the first syllable. For a moment he was again angry with himself for letting the admiration become so evident in his\ns voice, but when he saw the expression on Ron's face he couldn't help but genuinely grin along\nwith the rest of them. Ron had fallen flat on his\nface, and was wiping dirt from his clothes. He looked like he had single-handedly-moved a mountain, which was not that far removed from\nthe truth. \" A crow bar would not have helped a lot there. That was bloody amazing, Ron,\" remarked Marco. Ron looked like he was going to float away,\nbut quite suddenly his face became contorted\nwith a mixture of shock and pain. He yelped and\ngrabbed violently at the back of his neck. Marco, Zed, and Dan simultaneously leapt backward in\nfright.\n\"What's wrong, Ron?

The energy that oozed through the punk, inspired rebellious roots of The Jam which is still\nflowing vigorously through the\nveins of their old frontman, Mr Paul\nWeller.\nWeller takes to the stage amid\nrapturous applause, and rather\nappropriately kicks off with The\nChangingman, aptly describing his\nmusical genius that's more diverse\nthan a Cadbury's selection pack. In\nline with the album, the concert\ncontinues on a electric guitar based\nroller coaster ride, through Friday\nStreet, Science, Golden Sands and\noccasionally nipping back to\nStanley Road or Wild Wood for a tune or two. Sunflower arouses the\ncrowd and is followed by Brushed\nwhich gets the mosh-heads at the\nfront jumping.\nAs they switch to the acoustic\npart of the show, the spl iff s come out. Launching into Driving\nNowhere, You do Something to Me\nis quite literally breath-taking (pos-si bly because you're trying not to\ninhale any illegal substances!)\nAll this time a black cased piano\nhas been standing ominously at the\nside of the stage and as Weller\napproaches it, he is joined by an\nimpromptu string quartet and the\nsound of Broken Stones fills the air.\nPink on White Walls raises the\ntempo and it's back to the guitars\nfor Mermaids, one of the best off\nthe new album. The set winds\ndown with an extended version of\nHeavy Soul, Paul's personal\nfavourite and they troop off stage,\nonly to return for a phenomenal\nStanley Road. I Walk on Gilded\nSplinters caps off a truly remarkable concert.\nWeller is an artist who is at his\nbest when putting 100% effort into\nhis performance. With a sweat\npatch on his back the size of Africa,\nhe knows the punters have had\nvalue for money tonight. Proof\nthat, despite what NME reckon, the\nModfather can still rock. CI Elliot\nSUPERCHUNK\nThe Garage\nGrunge is dead (isn't it?) It\nseems such a long time\nsince Nirvana, Pearl Jam,\nAlice in chains et al were the bands\nof the moment. There no longer\nseem to be any true masters of that\nfine art form called feedback.\nAhhhh - feedback....It brings it all\nback doesn't it! But can you name\na band still playing true grunge?\nEven the remaining members of\nNirvana no longer have the grunge\nmuse, Grohl playing increasingly\nmore conventional rock (and very\ngood it is too) and Novoselic developing his strange and unique\nform of 'lounge grunge'.\nAnd so to the Garage in\nHighbury. The first band I saw, having missed the opening act, certainly tried to resurrect the genre\nbut seemed too young to have\nlived through and understood the\ngrunge attitude. All the same, it\nwas good to hear some good ole\nfeedback; the last couple of songs\nwere actually fairly good and it was\na shame we weren't told who the\nband were.\nMoving swiftly on to band two\n(Umbrella) and another beer\n(Guinness), we had a complete\ncontrast to the previous band. They\nwere polished where the last band\nwere more ragged but Umbrella\nlooked far too old to be still doing\nthis touring lark. Initial hopes of\ng rung in ess collapsed after the first\ncouple of songs and they lapsed\ninto a putrid pit of staid, lifeless\nrock. Disappointing isn'ta strong\nenough word for it... The person I really felt sorry for was their\nbespectacled lead guitarist who kept trying to put some life into the\nsongs but was thwarted by the terrible acoustics of the Garage; he\nand was obviously playing with\ngreat restraint, his frustration quite\nevident. So far, so mediocre.\nNow for the main draw of the\nevening - Superchunk - who' d come recommended to me by one\nof my esteemed colleagues as one\nof the classic grunge bands and I suppose they weren't bad, quite\ngood in fact, but they weren't grunge. A few of the older songs\nshowed that they used to be but\nthe newer songs we/e progressively smoother, more restrained,\nmore conventional and lacking in\noriginality. It seems that\nSuperchunk, like bands such as the\nSmashing Pumpkins and Pearl Jam,\nhave obviously felt the need to\nchange. Understandable but I felt I a little disappointed as some grunge would have provided a refreshing change to the normal\nindie and rock that dominates the\ngig scene. Still, Superchunk were\nfairly good and are the first band\nI 've ever heard to actually get a decent sound out of the Garage.\nUnfortunately neither this not the\ndelicious female bassist (in cide n tally, called Xena) managed to\nignite the crowd or to dispel the\ngeneral aura of disappointment\ninherent in an audience seemingly\ncomposed of a large group of fans\nof the band from \"the good old\ndays\". Shame. H Martin\n\n"

    "content": "23 January 1998 COLUMNS\nIn any organisation, the relationship between the Chairman or\nDirector and the man responsible\nfor the money is always a central\npart of its running. Splits here have\nthe potential to be extremely dam aging to the organisation, and it is\ncommon for leaders to be felled by\ntheir financial colleagues. When this\norganisation is Her Majesty's Government, the situation is even\nmore serious.\nOn the face of it, the present\nspat between Prime Minister Tony\nBlair and Chancellor of the\nExchequer Gordon Brown doesn't look too serious. Things were\nstirred up by publication of Gordon Brown's biography, written by Paul\nRoutledge. Although Brown's contribution was apparently minimal,\nhis brother had extensive interviews\nwith the author, and it is considered\nrelatively accurate. The main subject of media attention was his\nopinions of the 1994 Labour leadership contest, which you may have\nguessed Tony Blair won. At the time\nBlair and Brown were the foremost\ncandidates, with Blair additionally\nsome way ahead. Brown agreed to\nstand aside for his friend and colleague to run, allowing him to win\nthe election with little trouble. At\nthe time this was said to be a reasonable agreement between\nfriends, but has now been revised\nto suggest that Gordon Brown was\ndeeply upset and resented his colleague taking the prize by which\nsome accounts should have been\nhis. The biography also suggests\nthat even now Brown is not entirely\nen amour ed with Blair.\nSpats between Prime Ministers\nand Chancellors are as old as the\nExchequer itself. Perhaps somewhere in the world there will be a' Number Two' in politics who deeply loves and respects his superior, but none have come to light as\nmisconception. Labour chose Blair\nwith little fuss, for the first time in\naround thirty years choosing someone who appealed to the public\nrather than to its own extremities.\nDoubtless visions of the election of\nMichael Foot as leader in the early\neighties, purely to placate their own left wing, without a thought for\nwhether the public liked him, flashed through their mind. He led\nHamish Common\nWestminster Eye yet. This same resentment, if\nallowed to build up, can precipitate\nthe downfall of the leader. Geoffrey\nHowe' s public showing of resentment of Thatcher caused her down fall soon after. Macmillan disagreed\nwith and fired two chancellors over\ninflation, with his authority fatally\nundermined as a result. However\nthe difference between these cases\nand this one was the Prime Minister\nwas to blame. This time it is the\nChancellor. He had given the\nimpression that he thinks he should\nhave been Prime Minister. He thinks\nthe Labour Party wanted him as\nPrime Minister. He probably thinks\nthe public want him as Prime\nMinister. He is labour ing under a them to a disastrous General\nElection in 1983, when Thatcher's previously unpopular Government\nextended its majority in Parliament.\nBlair has been running the agenda:\nClause Four, no increase on income\ntaxes, the position on Europe, all\nthis has been of Blair's doing. The\npublic voted for Blair just as much\nas they did for Labour last May. So\nwith this backdrop Brown's com plaints seem all the more ridiculous.\nBlair was provoked into slapping\nthe Chancellor down, even removing him as Chairman of the Cabinet\nWelfare Reform Committee, with\nhimself in the chair and Prescott\n(who let him be reminded is the\nDeputy Prime Minister and the real\nNumber Two) as deputy.\nTogether with his recent\nspin doctoring disaster\nwhen badly-managed news\nreleases ensured a view of Brown\naddressing the Stock Exchange in\nfront of a sea of red figures. Soon,\nboth men saw sense and lavished\npraise on each other to calm the cri-sis.\nThe Times may have done its\npart of the story, public ising and\nthen publishing a serial is ation of the\nbiography, and then filling column\ninches with reports of the backlash.\nBut however one may want to\nblame the media, they were simply\nbringing to public attention something which should be in the public\ndomain. Any bitterness that the\nChancellor has about his overlord is\nworrying for the rest of us who have\nto live under their rule. As one\nLabour MP said \"I'm astonished that\npeople at the very highest level cannot be more disciplined. They are\nletting this run out of control. We are only eight months in govern-ment. They have got to get a grip.\"\nThere is no question of Brown going\nin the short term - indeed he has\ndemonstrated competence in his\nposition. But he would be wise to\nremember that Prime Ministers usually outlast Chancellors, and making\nhimself look silly in front of his party\nand the public will further reduce his\nown leadership chances or survival\nin post.\nTHE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO GETTING A FIRST with COLIN DALE\n\u2022 Over the next four weeks I will be presenting\nI a practical, step-by-step guide to help you\nI achieve academic success. If you are rea-Is on ably intelligent you should have no pro bI lem putting my ideas into practice and get-| ting a good degree. If you are unreasonable\n| intelligent you won't need to bother reading\n| it, as you are probably at Cambridge\nI already.\n\u2022 Cut out and keep the set, and for best\n\u2022 results file them in the special binder which\n\u2022 is available for just \u00a3 2 . 5 0 from the Felix\n\u2022 office. In tasteful black vinyl, it comes with\na complimentary \"I an so gullible I will buy\nanything\" T shirt.\nBefore I start dispensing my in des pensi ble advice, I'd like to point out that I take no\nresponsibility whatsoever for exam failures /\n'suicides / increases in the staff mortality\n\u2022 rate. This is partly who takes this seriously\nI is so stupid that they will fail their exams\nI anyway; and partly because I don't give a I toss. So, without further ado, here we go...\nPart One: Motivation\nIf you get a first from Imperial College, you will\nbe much sought-after. People from many\nestablishments will want to see you and will\nprobably be very keen to hang on to you. But\ndon't let this worry you, you may eventually be\nreleased back into the community if they\ndecide that you're not too much of a threat.\nThe route to academic success is long and\nhard, and requires a great deal of de termina tion. Your intelligence and commitment will be\ntested to the limits, and you will be assessed\nagainst the highest, most rigorous academic\nstandards. On the other hand, you might be\nstudying materials.\nThere will be many setbacks. For IC students,\nthe main obstacles to successful study are:\na) Unrequited love (does not apply to female\nstudents)\nb) Alcoholism, especially due to a)c) Attempting to get a degree in physics.\nThese difficulties can all be conquered. All you need is motivation, a reason to get out of bed\nin the morning (and at this time of year, it has\nto be good). If you are driven by intellectual\ncuriosity for your subject then you should have\nno problem. Those that are not suffering from\nmental illness, however, will need to train\nthemselves. Remember your new year's resolution (not the one about mixing your drinks\nbefore lunchtime; the other one about working\nhard and going to all your lectures)? Before getting up in the morning, try repeating to yourself\n\" My subject is really interesting\", until you feel\na spontaneous desire to leap out of bed and\nrush to your department. If it hasn't worked by\ndinner time, it's time to see the senior tutor.\nAlternatively, try reminding yourself of the\nrewards that your hard work will bring: \"In five\nyear's time I will be earning \u00a3 100,000 a year /\ndriving a flash car / the world's leading expert in\nnon-linear effects in bi ref in gent crystals at liquid helium temperatures.\" If this still doesn't work, there's always the fear of failure to drive\nyou on. This can be very effective, and has kept\nme going for two and a half years.\nPerhaps, at the end of the day, the best thing is\nto stop reading this nonsense and just buckle\ndown and work.\nColin Dale\n\n"

Even if you're headed for the more al turistic pursuits\nof medicine or research, the fundamental aim is self improvement.\nHave you ever stopped to consider\nhow selfish this is?\nNow, stop and ask you self the\nquestion \"Is Imperial College\nideal?\" If your answer is \"yes\", it\nmay be time to pay a visit to the\nfriendly health centre psychiatrist.\nIf it's \"no\", then why aren't you\ndoing something about it?\nOn Monday, nomination\npapers for the ICU sabbatical elections will appear on the notice\nboard opposite the union offices.\nThis initiates the annual campus-wide elections to decide who will\nhave the combined p rival edge and\ncurse of running the union next\nyear. There are four positions avail-able; the president, two deputies\n(one responsible for the finances\nand services, one for the clubs and\nsocieties) and, listed last as always,\nthe editor of Felix. YOU can stand\nfor these positions. Try to stop and\nthink about that; what would it be\nlike to actually do these jobs?\nSabbatical positions should not\nhowever be considered as job\nopportunities - they are rather a chance to break your selfish and\nuncaring habits, and make a real\npositive contribution to the life of\nstudents at Imperial College and\neven elsewhere. So, are you really\nin such a hurry to get that big-money city job and flash car that\nyou can't spend a year doing\nsomething genuinely valuable and\nworthwhile? You can't?So d you,\nthen.\nIf you are considering standing,\nas I hope you are, please remember that the current sabbaticals\n(Andy Heeps (President), Rob Clark\n(DP FSS), Charlie Joynt (DP C&S) and Jeremy Thomson (Felix Ed)) are\nmore that happy to offer good and\nbad advice about the positions.

    "content": "23 January 1998\nAWAY WITH THE FAIRIES\nARTS 19\nVICTORIAN FAIRY PAINTING\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nT his small magical mystery\nexhibition invites the visitor\nto penetrate the realms of\nthe enchanted kingdoms - or not\nalways so...\nThe passion for fairies and\nspecific interest in the supernatural,\nwhich took hold of and animated\nartists and writers from the early\n19th century, is a specific British\nextension of the Romantic move-ment, which was surging through\nEurope.\nThis passion contributed to\nstimulate imaginative powers and\ncelebrate the untouched kingdom\nof childhood, as well as to develop\na fascination for the occult.\nThe translation into English of\nthe Brothers Grimm' s and Andersen's tales was of capital\ninfluence, as was the strong popularity of Shakespeare's dramas.\nFairy tales were read by all ages.\nDickens wrote in their defence that\n\"in a utilitarian age, of all times, it\nis a matter of grave importance\nthat fairy tales should be respect-ed\".\nThere was an unprecedented\nrenewal of interest for fairy themes\nin the dramatic arts, especially bal-let. However, this ard our to depict\nin the most credible ways these\nfantastic worlds reveals the nostalgia of a world which is rapidly disappearing and the fear associated\nwith the unknown. These paintings\nare a protest against the defacing\ngenerated by industrialisation,\nas well as a way of refusing the\nsquare, scientific and rational view\nand interpretation of the world.\nThey are an ultimate attempt at\nallowing the possible existence of\nan invisible world, at giving a little\nspace to its fragile creatures.\nThe works presented are peopled with strange and surreal little\nbeings, birds, butterflies, trolls,\nko bold s,ni xie s, pixies, wood sprites, sylphs... absorbed in their\nprocessions or ritual dances. There\nare many scenes of evening gatherings in the forest, of vol up to us dances in the skies. Their worlds\nare reproduced in minute details.\nFrom many canvasses escapes a magical glow, a unique luminescence. Sometimes, fairies appear in\nthe human meditation and dream,\nbut explicit connection is also suggested between apparently drug-induced nightmares and this other\nworld.\nThe most striking exhibition is\nprobably Joseph Noel Patton's painting of \"The Quarrel of Oberon\nand Titania\", inspired from \" A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\n(A little revision of Shakespeare\n: Oberon, traditional King of Fairies,\nquarrels with his Queen Titania and\nresolves to torment her because\nshe will not surrender to him a changeling he desires to raise. He\ngives her a dose of a magic a phr odi asia c which enchants Titania with\nBottom until she has surrendered\nwhat Oberon sought. However, at\nthat point, he feels sorry for her,\nlifts his spell and reconciles with\nher - as shown in the 2nd of\nPatton's paintings on this theme).\nThe Scottish artists was associated with the Pre-Raphaelites,\nwhich indeed reflects in his meticulous attention to detail. The painting is fascinating in its intricacy.\nOne can spend hours looking at it -discovering something new each\nminute. Rarely have you been given\nsuch an in vita it ion to penetrate a painting.\nThere are numerous secondary\nscenes taking place around the\nmain one, many of which are very\nerotic.\nFor the Victorian period, this\ncanvass is indeed rather explicit. In\nmany others, er otis m is present as\nan undercurrent, such as in Thomas\nHeatherley's \"Golden Age\", always\ntrying to outsmart the moral and\nreligious interdicts of the age.\nThe nature of fairy painting\nchanged after 1880, the representation of great Shakesperian characters gave way to more generic\nfairies, to the personification of\nseasons and stars.\nHowever, not all displays are of\npure light and angelic sweetness.\nThere is a darker side to this world.\nSome of John Anster Fitzgerald's characters seem truly evil, and\ndirectly inspired from Jerome\nBosch's monsters. There, fairies do\ndie and carry grief. But it is through\nRichard Dadd that this representation is led to its climax. An atmosphere of threat and fear haunts\nsuch works as \"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\".\nThe enthusiasm for fairy painting was brutally and rather tragically ended with the beginning of\nWorld War One. The horrors that\nfollowed were such that they banished to childhood what had been\ndeemed, for a time, suitable for the\nadult's world.\nDanuta Pieter\nRoyal Academy of Arts,\nPiccadilly.\nTube : Green Park\n\u00a3 3 . 8 0 students.\nOpen daily 10am6 pm until 8 February.\nPAINTINGS MADE FROM PAINT[ PAINTING]\nBrendon Lyons\nI like being a quasi arts journalist.\nEven though few people actually read my stuff, it's worth it\njust for the perks of the job. One of\nthese has to be cycling through the\nrain to Maida Vale, knowing that\nyour carefully crafted hairstyle has\nbeen flattened and that your mascara is now on your cheeks, then\narriving at the pristine, clinical\nwhiteness of the Saatchi Gallery to\nbe greeted by a bunch of im mac u lately dressed real arts journalists is\nalways fun.\nSo it was a nice change to go\ninto a terribly run down basement\ngallery, where the lights weren't working, and the pervading impression was of rising damp. This is the\nBasement Gallery, Boundary Road,\nMaida Vale. 1 was handed a flyer\nfor this exhibition at random, and\nafter embarrassing myself in front\nof the massed art-people of\nLondon, I thought this would make\na nice change. It was.\nThe exhibition is a hundred\nmiles from the flat grace of Alex\nKatz's work, which is not to say\nthat it is bad. It's not, it's just different. Brendon Lyons is a youngish\nartist from Liverpool, who graduated from Arts School eighteen\nmonths ago. His work is very solid,\nit's painting made from paint.\nReally paint. He constructs shapes\nfrom solid paint. Examples of his\nwork includes paint hooks made\nfrom paint. These were positioned\non the walls at the distance where\nyou would expect to see paintings.\nBut the hooks themselves are the\npaintings. They look as if they could\nsupport a painting, but they can't. Obviously. They're made of paint.\nHis work is intended to fool the\nbrain, by showing something that\nthe eyes reject. Another painting is\na still life, a collection of objects on\nwhite stands. You can walk around\nthe painting, look at it from many\ndifferent angles, but it is still a still\nlife. Again, this is made from solid\npaint. But it's a painting. Got that?\nBrendon was very keen to point\nthis out to me, time and again. It\nreally is the most important part of\nthe exhibition. His work is very\ngood. Forget what 1 generally write\nabout modern art, this is really\ngood. Can we have this in the Ante\nRoom Gallery, please?\nJulia H Brendon Lyons: [painting]\nBasement Gallery\nBoundary Road\nMad i a Vale\nFree\nART WORLD When the new Chairman of the\nRoyal Opera House can say \"I don't want to sit next to somebody in a single t,a pair of shorts\nthen where the hell dow c go\nfrom here?

Cyyjiy yy i byu y BITCH IN' Dear Ed,\nDoes anyone know the collective noun for 'security dog with\nhandler? If not, might I suggest\n'waste'.\nYours,\nPaolo Cuomo( EEE3)\nSTRAW INNOCENT Dear Simon Baker\nAt he the end of the liberal\nSwinging Sixties, the student\nleader, Jack Straw campaigned against cannabis and now, he continues to oppose de criminal is ation or legal is ation of 'soft drugs'.\nWhatever, your personal beliefs on\nthe subject, he must be respected\nkeeping true to his. In the case of\nhis son, he took appropriate action\nimmediately when informed of the\nsituation. He acted in a wholly\nresponsible manner and without\nhypocrisy, and should be applauded for doing so.\nIt was unfortunate that Robin\nCook's marriage breakdown had to be played out in public. However,\nthe Government was bounced by\nthe tabloids into having to deal\nwith a matter that was of no consequence to the general public\nwhatsoever.\nIt is widely acknowledged that\nConservative MPs were hounded\nout primarily due to their macro-economic ineptitude and to a lesser extent by financial sleaze.\nWhere there was Tory sexual scandal in the last parliament, Labour\ndid not goon the attack as Simon\nBaker suggested. Again, it was the\npress that dictated public mood. I may not agree with Simon on many matters, but I had always\nthought that he was above using\n'trial by tabloid' as a critique of new\nLabour. The personal lives of all\npoliticians and their families should\nnot be fair game as they do not\naffect the competencies of the\npoliticians and are not in the public\ninterest. Okay, this may sound a bit post Diana touchy-feel y but\nwould you really like your personal\nlives dissected by the general pub-li c?I don't think so. No one, not\neven those who choose to be in\nthe public eye deserve this sort of\nintrusion. I'm sure that their jobs\nare difficult enough without having\nto deal with this sort of crap.\nNew Labour's mission is to transform and modernise the approach of the Labour Party while\nremaining true to its socialist ethic\n- an approach which I remind\nSimon Baker won Labour an extraordinary election victory.\nThe Christian values of the Labour leadership are the same as\nthose of ethical socialism and are\nquite different from the hypocritical 'Remember the Good Old Days'\nattitude of 'Back to Basics'.\nAshton McGregor Biochem III\nDOH! Dear Felix,\nFirst I must apologise for yet\nanother complaint hailing from St.\nMary's. This time, however, it is not\non the subject of union politics\nthough in this case I wish that it\nwas. Iam writing to express my disgust at the sports editorial featured last week. I will not repeat it\nbut for those who were fortunate\nenough not to read it I will merely\nsay that it conveyed the tragic\nnews of a colleague's death in a manner which was frivolous, disrespectful and inappropriate. The writer (Jacob) clearly has no feelings beyond his desperate wish to\nentertain readers de sp pite such an aim being entirely repugnant in this\ncase. Iam at a loss to know exactly why this piece was allowed to be\npublished with the insulting juxtaposition of sad news and upbeat\ntone. I was under the impression\nthat it was medics who lost respect\nfor human life but clearly I was wrong. I hope that no-one close to\nSimon read this piece. I'm sorry to\nbe so sombre but perhaps some consideration may be used in the\nfuture.\nYours,\nNick Oliver.\nAs I was with Mr Dunsby at\nthe time of his tragic death in the\nGuadalajara House of III Repute,\nI feel it is only correct that 1 com-ment. Simon's demise at the\nhands of the knife-wielding pimp\nwas sad, untimely and extremely\namusing. Ed.\nIC RED TAPE? NEVER! f Dear Felix,\nLast year I was away on exchange to Germany, and spent a lot of time getting annoyed by the\nbureaucracy. Now I 've come back\nto IC, and if anything it's become\neven worse over here!\nI'm on the committee of two different societies that have had to\nbook lecture theatres and in both\ncases have wasted hours trying to arrange this. Two years ago we would have gone to the person in\ncharge of organising lecture theatres in a particular department,\nchecked which lecture theatres\nwere free and booked them. This is\nnow impossible.\nInstead we have to go there\nand find it's free, then go and find a member of staff willing to take\nresponsibility, then goto the Conference Office and book the\nroom, then somehow get something from the Union so that we don't have to pay( although the\nUnion said they knew nothing\nabout this when we asked) and soon! Of course, none of these 4\npeople are there when we want\nthem to be, so everything takes 3\nor 4 trips. Why does everything\nhave to be so complicated?\nIn the year that I 've been away\nthis College has got noticeably\nmore bureaucratic and less efficient. I'm sure there are lots of\nexcuses but these come from people whose role in the College or\nUnion depends on the levels of\nbureaucracy\u2014I wonder whether it's really necessary.\nIs it surprising that we \"can't be\nbothered\"? Iam sick of this and after this week's organising, I 'll join\nthe apathetic majority.\nEmma Hobbs Physics 4\nThanks to everyone who\nwrote in with regards to the creationism feature / issue. Sadly we\ncan't fit them all in, but you can\nsee them in full on our web site\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix.\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday.

    "content": "12 MUSIC 23 January 1998\nTHABO MBI \u2022wE ff l Milen is back with his RnB crew, with a review of last years news and tastiest\ncuts.\nWhat up IC !! 1997 has come to an end,\nlots of shit has happened and Tha Bomb has\npulled out all the stops to bring you a whole\npage (yes, a whole page!) of the wicked goings\non as we review the year nine seven.\nThe big story in 1997 was the death of\nBiggie (RIP) on 9th March, having just attended the Annual Soul Train Music Awards, the\nbig man was gunned down and died almost\nimmediately. The hip hop world had just suffered a major loss with the death of Tupac\nand with the loss of Biggie many commented\nthat the East-West war had gone too far.\nUncertainty still surrounds both murders, but\none thing is for sure - death increases sales\nand Biggies' second LP, the double album Life\nAfter Death went on to be hugely successful.\nIt was even given the full five mic s by The\nSource, whether the LP deserved the full five\nis up to debate; my stand point is that it was\ngood, but five mic s? get real, there were\nother albums more deserving. To cap it off\nPuff released the tribute single /'// Be Missing\nYou, which went to number one over here and\nin the States; making loads of dollars. The\nBad Boy onslaught continued with Puffy\nbring in' out his own album (why? He can'tr1_____ rw'_______b P rap) called So Way Out. Meanwhile, the situation on the West Coast goes from bad to\nworse, with Suge Knight in jail Death Row was\nnot as prominent as it once was. Snoop's second album The Doggfather wasn't in the same\nleague as his first, the classic Doggystyle.\nMost people put it now to the loss of Dr Dre,\nwho left to form Aftermath Records; so far\nonly two releases from Aftermath, the compilation album Aftermath Presents... and the\nhigh profile Firm project The Firm. Death Row\nmade a comeback late on in the year with the\nrelease of the soundtrack album Gang\nRelated, most of the success was put down to\nthe number of Tupac tracks present. Tupac\nremains a huge draw as the release of the\ndouble album RU Still Down showed; the LP\nwas made up of old stuff from his days with\nInterscope Records and wouldn't have been\nreleased if he was still around.\nLots of stuff came out during the year as\nthe market was flooded with albums. The\nmost eagerly awaited was the Boyz II Men\nalbum, their follow up to II was Evolution, had\nthe boys evolved into men? Well I don't really\nknow what happen but they have certainly\nchanged, this is not as good as either\nCooleyhighharmony or //, the main problem\nbeing the collaboration with Puffy. They can\nsing better than most, but they can't sing\nevery style. Mary ) Blige, the queen of hip hop\nsoul returned with her third album, all the\ningredients were there, big time producers,\ngreat voice and yet this didn't seem to be\nenough. Perhaps its just that My Life and\nWhat's the 411 can never be topped. Still,\nthough Mary is the queen. My favourite of the\nyear was tha Missy album Supa Dupa Fly, this\ngirl can do it all, she's big all over. She writes,\nproducers, raps and sings! She has penned\nand produced numerous hits for Ginuwine,\nSWV, Aayihah and many more. Her album\nblew up huge, the two stand outs being the\ninfectious Supa Dupa Fly and Sock It To Me.\nShe's gonna me around for a time, so watch\nout. Speaking of SWV, they also brought out\nan album Release Some Tension, this was one\nof Puffy's disasters and certainly SWV\nshould've stuck with their former producer,\nthe album consisted of purely guest appear-ances, they should be renamed SWLOF\n(Sisters With Lots Of Friends). At the start of\nthe year Foxy released her III Na Na set and Lil\nKim dropped her Hardcore album, question:\nare they successful cos' they good rappers or\nbecause they remove nearly all their clothes?\nStaying wit the ladies, two nu soul acts\nappeared on the scene, one of dem blew up\nhuge while the other got lots of props, but not\nthe around commercial success of that other.\nThe two are Erykah Badu and Adrianna Evans,\nthe former blowing up while the latter had a better all round album and yet the success\ndid not come. Erykah's album Baduizm was\nphat and deserve the hype, but Adrianna\ncame correct with an even p hatter album\n(number one). The most surprising thing was\nthe jo dec i wannabes Dru Hill, they can from\nnowhere to release one of the most wanted\nalbums, the remix of In My Bed blew up big,\nbut can they sustain it - I think not.\nHaving actually read all of dis it seems like\nthere is nothing on the British crew, so lets\ncorrect that right now. This side of the\nAtlantic has got it going on too, in fact it was\nthe Americans who decided that London is\nthe coolest city on the whole damn planet.\nThe British crew are represent in' as good as\nall dem Americans, but for some reason all\nhere we don't seem to realise that our people\nare as good as them. If the artist is American\nwe seem to immediately believe they're class\nand if British then we don't consider them\ngood. Our boys and girls got all tha skill/, and\nthey bin showing it, we all got to buy the stuff,\nBritish is best. The best example is\nD' ln flu en ce, now on their third album they're\na class band, both Prince and Michael Jackson\nhave specially requested them to perform at\ntheir concerts as support and yet their success still remains limited. D' ln flu en ce are\nhype, their album's called London, buy it you\nwon't be disappointed. Next up we have Lyden\nDavid Hall, this man has just released his first\nalbum Medicine For My Pain its described as\nNu Soul and is as good as D 'Angelo. He says\nhe's been making this type of music for years,\nbut couldn't get signed till the scene took off\nbig, i.e. Maxwell and D 'Angelo. 97 was also\nthe year of Shola Ama, this young lady really\nblew up this year storming the charts and\nreaching the great highs of number one on\nmore than one occasion. You're the One Love\nreached number one and stayed there for an\nage, Shola must beware though that she is\nnot turned into a pop icon. As well as the\nemergence of exciting new acts we also had\nthe return of an old one - the Mack returned,\nMark Morrison. I really don't know what to\nsay about him, but sort it out. I just got to flip\nthe switch real quick and give big props to\nRoni Size, I ain't into drum and bass, but for\nsomeone to come from nowhere and win the\nMercury Music Prize deserves recognition.\nThere was lots of other shit happening\nthru' the year that I didn't cover, that wasn't cos I didn't rate the other stuff, but because I didn't have the time or space. Anyway that's all from me and the whole Felix RnB crew.\nPeace.\nMilen\nTha Bomb! - Tha Future\n97 over and 98 coming along thick and\nfast, there's a load of new people to look out\nfor in 1998. First up we got Jagged Edge, they\nain't as old as Blackstreet or as feeble as 112,\nbut these guys can sing for real and with the\nright marketing could blow up huge. They've\nalready dropped the first single The Way That\nYou Talk, which has been doin\u00b0 it on the dance\nfloors now we're just waiting for the long play.\nMyron is a young man with all the skill z, what\ncan I say, two promos released and blow in' up\nbig on the down low, whens the album drop-pin' y 'all. As well as all the new people we\nalso got some old heads drop in' again. The\nmost wanted and my tip for album of the year\nbefore I even hear it is the Faith Evans joint.

Some stupid play\nby the defence- Paul must have\nbeen thinking of his failures at the\n'Theatre' the night before and Andy was playing with his, already\nstrained banjo. They scored , but it\nwasn't long before we decided to\ngo back to our best skills and get\n\"stuck in\". Dazzler \"Babyface\"\nBoland finishing off a shit move\nfrom 25 yards and then went off at\nhalf time to be breast fed. The\nfourths came out in the second\nhalf with only one thing on their\nmind, so Swifty told us to stop\nthinking about sex and concentrate\non the game. This we did equal is ing through a fine move on the left\nand with the touch of the ground\nhog Phaedon scored a great goal.\nThe midfield all battled well and in\nthe last two minutes the fourths\ngot the lucky break they deserved,\ndazzle r scoring with a clinical finish\nfrom just inside the box. Special\nmention must go to STU who played an excellent second half\nand Morgan Roy Hill who has\ncome out of the desert and admitted his homosexuality.

This\ngame was no different from previous years as Imperial, though\noccasionally looking good when\ngoing forward, looked weak at the\nback. Midfielders like Foulstone\nand Pratt were clearly lacking\nmatch fitness. Ricky Gibson was\nrecalled as Tip pay a wong and Marcos were missing, while captain Chris Soberg put in a terrible\nperformance of which The Duke of\nPrague would be truly ashamed.\nIndeed his performance was so\npoor that he substituted himself\nmidway through the 2 nd half, then\nlaid most of the blame on Patsy\nGreen, a3rd year chemistry UG, who had refused to let Psycho\ndrink champagne out of her shoe\non the night prior to the game.\nQ MW, the League leaders,\nshocked the hosts as they took the\nlead in the first minute of the\ngame. Imperial showed character,\nhowever, and equalise d when Stewart rose to meet Brayn's left\nwing cross. IC then took the lead\nwhen Brayn coolly slotted the ball\ninto the top left hand corner.\nQ MW were given a lifeline\nafter Foulstone's fowl gave them a penalty, then went 3-2 up just\nbefore half-time after 'keeper\nKeane misjudged a corner. Hopes of a come-back were dashed when\nQ MW got a fourth at the start of\nthe half, even though Pratt pulled\none back. Italian whizz-kid Roberto\nreplaced Gibson, and was given a harsh introduction to the English\ngame as he was brutally brought\ndown twice. Eventually Amo pulled\none back. Towards the end, German Shanidze was sent off for\nthe most blatant foul ever seen at\nHarlington.\nFollowing this set-back it is better to read the League table upside\ndown as far as Imperial are con-cern ed. Indeed it's a bit like\nPrague's situation under German\nterror during WW II. But, just as\nthe Allies turned the tide and carp et bombed Dresden there are\npositive signs, too. Next month the\nFirsts play UMD S in the Cup semifinal as well as taking on UEA in\nBUSA.

It warms my heart\nto see how the nation has united\nin a display of the grief over this\ntragic loss.\nAcross the country, thousands\nare queueing to sign books of\ncondolence and leave flowers and\ncheap trinkets at the many Simon\nShrines. To commemorate his\nremarkable life, the band Black\nLace (close friends of Simon) are\nreleasing Aga doo'98 featuring the\nmodified chorus:\nSimon D.D.D. He was wounded fatally.\nSimon D.D.D. Now he's in the cemetery.\nAll profits go to the Simon fund\n(proprietor J. Thome), order yours\nnow!\nAs for my tribute to him, Simon worked ceaselessly to dig up stories for the Felix sports\npage. He truly was our Prince of\nSpades.\nThe fascinating story of\nSimon's life is documented in my\nbook Simon - His True Story\n(unlike all the other Simon books\nwhich are complete fabrications\nand not worth the paper they're\nwritten on).\nJacob.\nPS It is my pleasure to introduce\nmy new collaborator Niall Darwin.\nI tried to pass on my extensive\nknowledge to him but it seems he\nis already well versed in the art of\ntea making.\nNew Formula 1\ncontender revealed.\nSchumacher\nHaving ga wp ed&. gasped at the\nfeats performed by two \"Cirque de\nSoleil\" contortionists 1 was now being amazed at the timing &. acrobatic skills of their many tramp olin is ts. Performing on an \" X\" shaped\ntrampoline sunk into the Albert\nHall's stage they somersaulted &.\nflick-f lacked around, over &. under\neach other at ridiculous speed.\nCome the end of the performance Iam suddenly reminded\nwhat I came here for as a huge\nscreen drops down out of the ceiling &va video of yellow racing cars\nscreaming around a circuit starts\nplaying. I'm here to see the launch\nof Jordan's attack on the 1998\nFormula 1 World Championship.\nFollowing a short animation introducing their dramatic new wasp logo, the new car is dropped out of\nthe rafters &. stage hands go to\nwork removing its supporting chains. Damon Hill &. Ralf\nSchumacher (Michael's younger\nbrother) then appear & start posing\nwith the car for the paparazzi, smiling broadly.\nLater, in the press conference,\nwhizzes about in the new Jordan.\nthe driver's smiles are still present\nas they answer questions about the\nnew car & their chances of winning\nin it. They appear fairly confident\nof bringing the team its first ever FI\nwin this season.\nThe car they hope will bring\nthem these race wins outwardly\nseems little different to last year's design despite rule changes resulting in less effective wings &. tyres.\nThe most obvious difference is\ntheir new logo replacing the snake\nof last year. Under the skin they\nhave an entirely different engine, a Mugen Honda, changed from last\nyear's Peugeot. This could prove a mixed blessing, the deciding factor\nbeing whether the engine is mostly\nMugen or mostly Honda. If championships were decided\nby launch parties then Jordan\nwould have this year's sewn up,\nwith bonus points for omitting the\nSpice Girls. Unfortunately they\naren't, but with the help of\nDamon's experience look out for\nJordan winning a couple of races\nthis year.\nNiall.\n\n"

If this\ntrack is anything to go by it's gona be absolutely tearing.\nStarts off with plenty of atmospheric als, dark\nstepping beats roll-over the moody strings, with\nbeats cut in 8. out over the top.

    "content": "SY Issue110423 January1998 NEW FICTION NEXT WEEK Raising Demons\nWin Tickets to\nBoogie Nights\nSpecial Bumper\nIssue\nHybrid Sportsmen KENT YIP\nThe Executive Committee of ICU\nreversed the decision reached by\nthe council last term to submit\njoint IC-ICSM entries into BUSA\ncompetitions for all sports.\nThe new \"hybrid\" proposal,\nwhich allows selected teams to\nenter separately, was backed up by\n24 votes to 17. Should this bid be\nrejected by BUSA, the official position of the Union is to support dual\nentries for the next three year.\nAt present, only five clubs have\nclear ideas on the mode they will\nadopt next year. Whilst separate\nentries will be submitted by the\nhockey, rugby, and football clubs,\nthe rowing and fencing teams will\ndefinitely field a combined squad for\nBUSA events. The respective clubs\nfrom IC and ICS M must agree\nbefore they can submit a single\nentry. However, once this decision\nhas been taken, they cannot turn\nround to demand for separate\nentries the following year. In con-tra st, clubs which originally go for\n\"dual\" mode but subsequently fail to\nput up two teams will still have the\noption to turn \"single\".\nMost departmental representatives from the Royal College of\nScience Union voted against the\nmotion because it stipulated \"dual\nentry\" as the back-up should the\n\"hybrid\" proposal be rejected by\nBUSA. Katie Nolan, Broadsheet editor and RSCU member, said smaller\nclubs would lose out. She argued a combined IC team would perform\nbetter nationally to attract private\nsector sponsorship. This would reduce their financial dependence\non the Union to the benefit of smaller clubs.\nHowever, there is no evidence\nthat this would be the case with the\nrowing and fencing teams, the two\nsports most frequently cited as the\npotential victim of medics non medics separation. At the executive\ncommittee meeting, Natasha\nNewton, member of the 1C women's rowing squad, expressed\nthe indifference towards BUSA com petitions held by her team. Since the\nwomen's squad are made up entirely of students from St Mary's, its\nstrength will be unaffected. On the\nmen's side, only one member will be\nexcluded.\nAndy Heeps, president of ICU,\nsaid that a hybrid entry would allow\na smoother transfer to single entry:\n\"It would come together naturally\nrather than being forced.\" He added\nthat most medics at present do not\ntruly regard themselves as part of\nIC. The situation will be different\nnext years, since the new intakes will\nbe based at South Kensington. He\nalso disagreed that the Union's determination to work towards a single BUSA entry for sports clubs\nhad implications for other societies.\nIt is unlikely that the Orchestra,\nOpera, and Rag, will be under pressure to merge with their non-medics counterparts in the future,\nand furthermore such mergers\nwould lead to im practically large\nsocieties anyway. \"Certain societies\nwill be easier to be merge than o th ers, with sports so ce i ties, things\nwere complicated with BUSA.\"\nThe World According to Benn HAMISH COMMON &. BUZ\nBARSTOW\nOn Monday 19 January Rt Hon\nTony Benn MP gave a speech in\nthe Mech Eng Department, hosted by ICU Labour Club. Mr Benn,\n73, showed a remarkable insight\ninto the problems of the modern\nworld: He warned that if the pleas\nof the poor and unemployed were\nnot heeded, the world could see\nanother rise of fascism as seen in\nthe 1930s, born out of the extreme\npoverty in Europe.\nMr Benn became an MP in\n1950. Though forced to step down in 1960 after inheriting a title, he\nre-entered the Commons in 1963\nand has remained there since. He\nonly left the House briefly in 1984\nafter losing his Bristol seat to a Conservative - he is currently MP for Chesterfield.\nHe spoke of the current global\npolitical climate, saying that soon\nthe world would be at the same\ncross-roads it faced in the 1930s, choosing social justice and freed om rather than the easy answer of\ndictatorship. The social insurance\nthat safeguarded everyone, he\nadded, was now either too expensive or uneconomical. However, he\nfelt that social welfare was vital,\nproviding social cohesion and a backdrop to the lives under it, in\nspite of its vast cost with no immediate return. The system self-per-pet u at es through education, in providing a new generation of people\nembedded with a sense of social\nresponsibility. He admitted that\nthis system had come under pressure from economic and media\nforces, but their influence could be\ncountered by society contributing\nto building a better future. The\nstruggle, he foretold, could be long\nand painful, hinting nothing short of\ndeconstruction of the modern world will ensure its future.\nTony Benn's speech was heard\nby about 100 people, and was\nforthright and typically off the cuff.\nThroughout his talk he demonstrated a 'healthy disrespect' for the\nLabour leadership without criticising them personally, saying that he\nabhorred personal insults.\nAnswering questions at the\nend, Tony Benn continued to display a wide knowledge of a number\nof fields. However, Tony Benn still\nseems optimistic: Whatever the\nway of the world, he stills believes\nhumanity will do the best it can.\n\n"

    "content": "23 January 1998 MUSIC 13\nALBUMS THE HIGH LLAMAS\nCold And Bouncy\nThe Llamas: Sorry, hut I just\ndon't understand.\nI 've never had a lot of time for\nthe High Llamas since they\nremixed a favourite Boo Radleys song Find the Answer\nWithin a few years ago. The 'remix'\nconsisted wholly of slowing the\nsong down a little, adding some\nirritating dog-whistle style organ\nover the top and altering Sice's voice so that he ended up sounding as if he was singing down a scaffold tube.\nBut, like everyone else, once I heard the single Tilting Windmills\non the radio a dozen times I ended\nup thinking ' Hmmm, that'sO K,1 quite like that1, rather like someone\nlistening to a new Beautiful South\nsong might. Next thing I know, I 've\ngot sixteen tracks to write intelligently about. Here we go then with\nthe compulsory trivia section:\nBy my count, Cold and Bouncy\nbrings the Llama-factor up to six\nalbums, not including Sean\nO 'Hagan's solo effort The High\nLlamas (I), the handful of\nMicrodisney jobs or those rather\nhalf-arse d mini albums that bands\nseem to love so much. And yes,\nfive points for recognising Sean\nO 'Hagan as the keyboard player on\nmany of the finest Stereolab\nalbums.\nSadly, though, it's easy to lose\ncount. After all, how do you know\nwhich record is playing in the lift in\nKwiksave on a particular day? What\ncan I mean with that backhanded\ninsult? Well, simply that this album\nsounds much like the others; seventy four minutes of background\nmusic. It's pleasant, well-produced,\neasy on the ear, a little trip py even,\nbut will all the bumps and edges\nsmoothed out 1 just can't seem to\nget enthusiastic, as you can probably tell from this incoherent review.\nSo, before this piece totally falls to\npieces in my hands, let's have a look at the tracks:\nThe Llamas kick off with a rather nice little ditty Twisto Teck,\nwhich lasting just forty-five sec-on ds, is quite bearable. They\nlaunch straight into The Sun Beats\nDown, a gentle track with a soft\nbeat, inoffensive backing chords,\nxylophones and strange bubbly\nnoises that sound like a bong played through a Moog. Occasionally, some vocals break in,\nfollowed by a strings break, as\nnight follows day. It's hard to say\nexactly when track two ended and\nthree begun, but before you know\nit Tilting Windmills is half way\nthrough, and it is the liveliest track\non the album. Songs five to ten\nglide by while you are making yourself quick cup pa, with only Showstop Hip Hop living up to its\nname, at first anyway. Jolly jingle\nbells accompany a relaxed reggae\nbeat, which speeds up to a break\nand then it's back to - can you guess? Inoffensive backing chords,\nxylophones and strange bubbly\nnoises...\nIf you're a Llamas fan, I 've probably irritated you so much by now that you'll buy the record out of\nspite.

It's got some great stuff on it,\nespecially Julianne and Song for\nthe Dumped, but as live albums\ngo, it's fairly average. It can't com pare to Ben Folds Five, the first\nalbum, or to Whatever and Ever,\nAmen, but then, I never expected\nit to. I wasn't expecting the sheer\nrubbish of For Those of Ya'll Who\nWear Fannie Packs, which apparently is a Beastie Boys piss-take,\nbut quite frankly, it's not big, it's not clever and it's certainly not\nfunny. Before I listened to this\nalbum, I read the. Independent's review, which said that Ben Fold's Five were a band completely without soul. This was after having listened to the sheer beauty of\nPhilosophy and Alice Childress.\nThat's a very harsh view, and also\nan unfair one. This album isn'ta good representation of their work,\nbut it'll do until they release a new\none. It would get five stars,\nbecause I love them, despite their\nphotos, except 1 hate that Beasties\nBoys song. H Julia\nBOOGIE NIGHTS\nOriginal Film Soundtrack\nT he Seventies. What an era.\nSome will ask why fashion\ntook the course it did back in\nthe days of the side burn. Why were\npeople allowed to wear bright\ngreen satin shirts along with brown\ntrousers that flared over twenty\ninches? And not only that, why were they allowed to wear ties that\ncould have wallpapered a small\nroom along with mohair jackets\nthat looked as though the wearer\nhad a Van de Graaf generator\ntucked underneath? The answers to\nthese questions are academic really but whatever they did a bit wrong with their fashion, they never did it\nwith their music. I mean, this was\nthe decade of bands like Funkadelic\n(space age sets and, again, stupid\nclothes), Kool and the Gang (vocals\nthat resembled someone or gas ming - all before nosediving into\nthe horrible quagmire that was the\neighties) and Hot Chocolate( mmm, you know what 1 mean...).\nWell, this album doesn't contain\nany of those names and prefers to\nstay with the more popular and\ntypically Fame-esque songs. It\ndoes, however, contain classics\nsuch as Best Of My Love by The\nEmotions, Ain't No Stoppin' Us\nNow and the Beach Boys' God Only Knows, described once by\nJohn Lennon as the nicest song\never written. There's also a helping\nof some quirky pop too with the\nlikes of Brand New Key by Melanie,\na strange little track which has\nsomething to do with girls on roller-skates. But it's not all brilliant as it\ngets into an early eighties phase\nnear the end with songs like Livin'\nThing by ELO. Eeurghl!\nDisgust aside, this album is a pretty good collection of some of\nthe (camp) best of the '70s... viva\ndisco! CI\nAlok\n\n"

The first is plenty\nof dirt and juicy gossip. The\nsecond is that it's so bad that the\nsubject didn't want anything to do with it.\nIt doesn't take long to place\nthis in the second category. The\nauthor begins with a nauseatingly\nsycophantic description of the\nLeicester Square premiere of\nColdeneye and manages to irrelevantly include how much more\nregal Brosnan is than the future\nKing of England. The narrative\nremains at this level throughout.\nThe writing is reminiscent of pre-GCSE essays when one is still\nlearning to master onomatopoeia s and simile. To be fair a lot of\ninformation has been collected but\nmost of it is based on remarks\nmade by neighbours, distant family\nand numerous magazine and\nnewspaper reviews.\nA picture of Brosnan does\nslowly evolve and for somebody\nwho felt abandoned by his parents\nand picked on at school for being a tall skinny runt, he has done quite\nwell for himself. However, one\ncannot help but feel that any valid\nbiography should include a substantial input from the subject him-self.

Keener is in a worse situation still - even the ugly blok e from the local video store has\ndumped her and she's worried\nthat her friend will forget her\nonce the wedding day arrives.\nThis is an observant but gentle\nfilm with likable characters. There\nare one or two interesting subplots along the way but the\nhappy ending is never really in\ndoubt. This video is thus only\nworth buying if you are fascinated\nby insecure females and their\nrelationships. II Chris\n\n"

The \"face a face\"\nbetween Nicolas, the state official,\nplayed by Nick Roberts and Victor,\nthe father of the persecuted family,\nplayed by Qh yg oem* z, was laden\nwith a strong intensity. Without\nwords, Victor transmitted, by the\nconvulsion of his face and limbs,\nhis rage, the unbearable helplessness of his situation, the atrocious\nmental torture inflicted upon him\nand the disgust of a man who is\nbeing afflicted more each second,\nall of which enhanced Nicolas' sadistic enjoyment and per sever ance.\nCaroline Baillie interwove the\nplays in such a way that the second\nplay directly followed this confrontation. There was a brief\nswitching back to the former,\nbefore the last play. Finally, it is the\nlast scene of the first play which\nends this trilogy, very originally put\ntogether to emphasise the various\n......\nThe Kid in \"Gotcha!\": Physics\npostdoc Matthew Williams\npotential links between the three.\n\" Got cha!\", by Barrie Keefe,\nfocuses on a different kind of individual freedom; freedom within the\nschool system and how quickly you\nare excluded if you do not fit into\nthe mould. An educational system\nwhich lacks\nnot only the\nability but also\nthe will to\nmake the\nmost of individual capabilities, quickly\nmarginal is es the 'different'\nand the weak-er.\nIn an extreme situ a tion, following\na strange turn\nof events, the roles of au-thor it y are re-versed and the Kid (physics\npostdoc Matthew Williams) confronts his school teachers and\nheadmaster. His desperate cry for\nattention ends dramatically, as he\nis thrown back, banished forever to\nhis status of outcast in society.\n\"Hell is others\" - probably one\nof the most famous lines of French\nTheatre, summarise s Sartre's\" NoWay Out\". Upon their deaths, two women and a man arrive in Hell,\none after the other. There is no fire\nnor a torturer as they would have\nexpected but they rapidly realise\nthat the greatest torture that could\nhave been imposed upon them was\nto be confined together for e terni ty. Unable to free themselves, by\ndeath, of the ever growing torture\none inflicts on the other by pressing\nupon him for what he will never\nget, there is no possibility of\nescape.\nThe actors, Ron Irwin, from the\n\" European Administration Office, as Garcin,\nN 'Diorel Ba, a final\nyear chemist, as\nEstelle and Caroline\nBaillie as Inez, succ e deed with brilliance in developing\nthis infernal spiral\nwhose culmination\ngoes beyond human\nperspective.\nAmongst the various links between\nthe three plays was\nthe closed room, with the locked\ndoor. All the time, the audience too\nwas locked in. Tying the plays\ntogether so closely was an invitation to draw the different characters together in one way or a no th er. It left open the possibility for the\nspectator to imagine a character\nfrom one play developing into that\nof another and relate a certain\nbehaviour to its possible evolution\nunder new conditions.\nThe production was put on in\nthe Union, without a stage, making\nuse of the entire space of the room with the audience seated all around\nit, very close to the actors.\nThe music was produced in\nAustralia by Solange Kershaw. She\nworked on it in conjunction with\nCaroline Baillie via email. Caroline\nwould email her every night after\nthe rehearsal and explain her exactly what had been done, how the\ngeneral feel for the production was\nprogressing. \"The other day I explained how1 needed to create\nthe idea of a child's spirit floating\naround the parent's heads\" she\ntold Felix.\nAnd the result was a wonderful\nachievement, music that formed\none body with the acting. But she\nadded : \"Solange and I understand\neach other well - we wouldn't have\nbeen able to do this if we had not\nworked together for a long time\".\nHow did she go about directing ?\n\"I tend to go by intuition\"she said,\nemphasizing that she is very conscious of not changing that\napproach.\nDr. Baillie indeed leads a dou ble career - as scientist and engi-ne er, she understands the constraints of rigorous ness, and as\nactor and director, she wishes to\nleave an open space for creativity.\nOften asked whether she sees\nherself always having these two\nseparate strands in her life, she\nreplies that she believes that \"soci-e ty is beginning to understand the\nneed to develop cross-disciplinary\nskills, in ancient times, engineers\nwere also artists and musicians.\nWhy should this be so strange\ntoday ?\"\nDanuta Pieter\nMARIO BENZEDRINE'S POP-UP APOCALYPSE\nEtcetera Theatre, Camden\nT his is an unnerving, vicious\nand shockingly funny play. It\nis performed with spectacular power by the lone Rhodri Hugh,\nin a gargantuan physical display of\nemotive violence, exploring with\nuncontrolled savagery the crisis-ridden modern psyche.\nMario Leonardo Benzedrine, as\nhe introduces himself, is a soul on\nthe very edge of the abyss. The\nmonochrome set consists on a ring\nof fairy lights, an ethereal door and\nan item of strange wheeled monogrammed furniture which Mario later introduces as his wife. The\nroom is entered by Mario, hyperactive, be suited, addressing the audi-en ce, rolling, jumping, pacing every\nsquare inch of the lit circle. Hugh's portrayal is m esme rising; each biting phrase given full treatment, the\nslightest shudder made brutally\napparent for the invasive ly close\naudience.\nThe play consists of a single\nfifty-five minute monologue, broken only by the increasingly large\nmood-swings of the increasingly\nmanic performer. The more\nderanged he becomes, the more\nanimal his motions become, the\nfurther we delve into his soul to his\nprimal fears, the more Mario' s physical appearance mirrors what\nis going on; his pinstripe suit altering into a mental patient's romper\nsuit and his pleasant features contorting in unfathomable emotion\nand dazzling verbal torrent. His\nmood swings coincide with crisp\nsound and lighting effects and 180\u00b0\nturns in subject matter; a laying\nbare of the layers of the troubled\nbeing before the audience, culminating in a desperate whirling\ncrescendo and stark bleak snapping\nfinish.\nWhen Hugh returned to the\nstage for the curtain call it was disturbing to see a normal human\nbeing at the end of it, the audience\ntemporarily frozen before tearing\ndown the curtain of tension with\nwarm relieved applause. Only then\ndid I realise that I had possibly not\nbeen breathing for the last two\nminutes and that I couldn't remember the first thing he had said for\nthe last hour. No matter, it is the\njourney that is important here, the\nroute taken is riveting but ultimately unimportant, taking you through\npain, exultation, fear, compassion\nand hatred, drawing you ever clos-er. I recommend this play without\nreservation. I'm paying to see it\nagain next week. If you think that\nyou can take Mario Benzedrine's terrifying pace, I 'll see you there.\nMr. Trout\n\n"

    "content": "23 January 1998 NEWS\nDAVID ROBERTS\nThe next stage in Imperial's \"Campus Renaissance\" has now begun, with the refurbishment of\nthe college power-plant getting\nunderway. The four existing heavy\noil burners, which are reaching the\nend of their economic lifetime, will\nbe replaced with two gas fired\nengines which will produce both\nheat and power. The new plant\nshould be more environmentally\nfriendly than conventional genera-tors, as all waste heat will be recycled. Emissions of carbon dioxide\nshould fall by 7 5 0 0 tonnes per\nyear.\nTo maintain the supply of\nsteam to 1C, the first stage of the\nproject is the construction of a temporary boiler house on Dalby\nCourt. This plant will be gas-fired,\nand requires a new gas main to be\nlaid. Once operational, at the end\nof March, the existing boiler house\nlocated beneath the basements of\nthe Electrical Engineering department will be disconnected and\ndismantled, and work on the\ninstallation of the new boilers will\nbegin. Speaking to Felix, Ron\nJeeves, the project manager, said\nthat he hopes the project will be\ncompleted by the end of 1999,\nallowing the new plant to become\noperational for the millennia.\nMr Jeeves estimated the total\ncost of the project at \u00a3 8 million,\nwhich should be repaid \"over eight\nor nine years\". Considering the\nestimated thirty year life for the\nnew engines, he felt that the project represented a sound eco no mic and environmental move.\nTiger Trouble WILLIAM SMITH\nThe recent turbulence in South\nEast Asian economies could force\na decline in applications to\nBritish Universities from\nOverseas students.\nAs a whole, the UK stands to\nlose \u00a3 3 0 0 million if applications fall\nas predicted.\nMalaysian authorities have\nwarned that up to 80% of students\nmay now study locally instead of\nabroad. The average drop is\nexpected to be around 40%. Many universities are expected to shift\ntheir recruitment efforts to the\nMediterranean, South Africa and\nEastern Asia to make up the deficit.\nOthers, such as Warwick, have set\nup schemes to give financial aid to\noverseas students wishing to study\nhere.\nDespite fears over some Eastern economies, applications\nfrom Singapore and Hong Kong are\nexpected to continue to rise at a steady rate. This was backed by\nSingapore's Deputy Prime Minister,\nTony Tan, who pledged ongoing\nsupport for those wishing to study\nabroad.\nIt is far to early to have any\naccurate idea of the number of\napplications this year, but many\nuniversities could find a gap in their\nincome to the tune of millions of\npounds.\nRussell? Russell Who? ANDREW OFORI\nThe mystique of the Russell\nCroup has recently been dispelled\nby a leaked letter to the Secretary\nof State.\nWith the group's pro-fees\nobjectives clearly exposed various\nstudent bodies are organising\nopposing initiatives in an attempt\nto keep higher education access i ble.\nThe Russell Group, similar to\nthe American Ivy League, consists\nof 17 of Britain's most prestigious\nHigher Education Institutions represented by their Rectors and ViceChancellors. The group, which includes universities such as\nOxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and\nImperial, has been shrouded in\nsecrecy and consequently attracted\nthe attention of related student\nunions. The Group was formed in\n1994 to prior it is e and concentrate\nresearch efforts amongst institutions; the discussions have subsequently progressed to the issue of\n'top-up' fees which entrants would\nneed to pay for the privilege of having what is deemed to be a better\nstandard of education by attending\na Russell Group university.\nDespite the fact that many\nRectors and Vice-Chancellors have\nconsistently denied the existence of\nthe group, a shadow group was\nformed to oppose the top-up fees.\nThis committee, known as the\n'Aldwych Group' is made up of the\npresidents of student unions, UL U and the NUS. It had been set up in\norder to directly counter the Russell\nGroup's pursuit of top-up fees and\nis leading the battle with positive\naction. The Group also plan to highlight the threat of top-up fees more\nopenly, thus high lig h ing the existence of the Russell Group.\nThe controversy is currently\ncentred around the 'Teaching and\nHigher Education' bill that Labour\nwill introduce to Parliament on the\n26 January. It currently contains a clause that prevents universities\nfrom any financial gain as a result of\ncharging higher fees than the prop o sed Government levels. The\nRussell Group are pressing for an\namendment that would enable\nthem to profit from whatever fees\nthey decide upon.. Sir Colin\nCampbell, Vice-Chancellor of\nNottingham University, wrote to\nthe Secretary of State on behalf of\nall the Russell Group, describing the\ntop-up fees as a necessary aid in\nthe preservation of autonomy and\nstandards in UK higher education.\nChina was cited as an example\nwhere paying fees privately was\nstandard; \"Only substantial increases in public funding can avert such\na scenario here unless quality is to\nbe rapidly and irretrievably dam aged\". The letter alluded to a meeting between the Department of\nEducation and the Russell Group,\nand confirms the existence and the\nactions of the Russell Group.\nIn opposition, the Aldwych Group are also formal ising and\nestablishing a secretariat in the UL U building. They are planning to book\na room in the House of Lords, inviting MPs and Lords to lobby for the\ncontinuance of the current clause in\nthe higher education bill. Siva\nGaneshanandan, treasurer of the\nAldwych Group, explained how the\nRussell Group were now \"coming\nout of the woodwork\" compelling\nmany institutions to fight for an\neducation \"without financial restrictions\". The NUS refuse to condemn\nthe Russell Group outright but supported actions of the Aldwych Group when they take effective\naction against fees.\nAndy Heeps, ICU President and\nactive member of the Aldwych\nGroup, explained how the top-up\nsystem could lead to the development of an elitist culture within\nHigher Education. He saw the current situation at Oxbridge where\n50% of students are from private\nschools as a depiction of what\ncould occur in the Russell Group\nUniversities. He predicted top-up\nfees would place all universities in a 'win-win' situation where the members of the Russell Group would\nreceive all top-up fees (which is not\nthe case with Labour's tuition fees)\nand the \"lesser, newer universities\"\nwould benefit as a result of applications from top students that could\nnot afford to enter the Russell\nGroup. Mr Heeps stated it would\nonly be the students that lost out\neven with the \"bursa ries and scholarships\" suggested by Sir Campbell\nin his letter, and denounced top-up\nfees as \"detrimental to Higher\nEducation in this country\".\n\n"

    "content": "8 COLUMNS 23 January 1998\nReligion is, and always has\nbeen, a funny old game. It\nleads people to believe all sorts of\nodd ideas both for and against the\nproposition. It even has me agreeing with that fellow right-winger\nKarl Marx insofar as it is in major\npart a doctrine of social control\nthat has assured the dominant\nposition of the Church in most\nsocieties. Sadly, it does not make\nfor scintillating letter page\ndebates; those of you who have\nbeen here longer than is healthy\nwill recall such an episode in 1993.\nWhich brings us to last week's edi-tion. Normally I can see no justification for anonymity on the Felix\nletters page, but when one writes\nsuch an astonishingly ill-construct-ed letter as our 'astonishingly\npissed-off biochemical friend, I 'll\naccept that there are when one\nshould hide one's light under a bushel. Though I agree broadly\nwith what was said, you are only a slightly sticky wicket criticising the\ncoherency of Wes Hinsley's article.\nThere is also little point getting\npersonal when you are criticising\nan article as flawed as the one in\nquestion. I have no intention of\nentering the debate, but I must say\na few words about Mr Hinsley's letter. The style of it started to set\nalarm bells ringing- dissect the\npoints exhaustively, intersperse\nvagueness with accurate ir re le vance. The lad's a professional, I thought, and, would you believe it,\nwhat did I see on the walkway i today? A poster Qj\nfrom 'His People \\y Religious^ Ministries' offer y^ ing Bible studies*\"L4\ngiven by none\nother than W. Hinsley. It is\nindeed a small\nworld, whether or\nnot you believe!\nHe created. In\nshort, my Felix\ncolleagues have unwittingly given a platform to an evangelical tambourine operator. Knowing what\nfine chaps they are, I know this will\nnot happen again. Religion is fine\nfor discussion, but unlike politics,\ncannot be discussed usefully by\nco;u o those at either end of the spec-t rum.I will stop short of suggesting that Christian fundamentalism\ndisrupts normal intellectual\nprocesses. You've had your fifteen\nminutes of fame, Wes. This is not\nthe forum for religious zealot ry, I'm afraid.\nThe dear old\nfIN US seems to\nmaking waves\nagain. Firstly,\n^ they are suggesting that we f+ drink less,\n1 adhering to the\nf Tv Department of\nHealth figures,\nwhich have been\ncalled into ques-tion, particularly\npf with respect to\nthe low recommended intake for women. Secondly, the NUS President,\nDouglas Trainer is arousing opposition within the ranks. Though not\na member of this august body, 1\nalways avidly follow and ignore\ntheir edicts; if a bunch of self-important, ideologically bankrupt\nmuppets think they can reduce my\nforays into Southside Bar, which\nhas started the year in characteristically magnificent style, they are\nsorely mistaken. Ideological bankruptcy partly explains the second\nissue. Time was when the NUS spouted utter drivel, but drivel that\nhad conviction. Nowadays, the\nposition of President is simply\nused as a stepping stone to a safe\nLabour seat. Though the idea that\nthe NUS are in the pocket of New Labour is hardly a startling revel a tion, it never ceases to amaze me\nthe lengths to which people like\nDouglas Trainer will go in order to\nfurther their own interest, with virtually no regard for the people\nwho foolishly elected them.

Those who do not fancy\nthemselves as Sigmund Freud\nwould put this rather more simply:\nall people worry occasionally.\nSome people worry a lot.\nEverybody knows a neurotic.\nThey live inside a self-fabricated\npadded cell. (No, that's not a stylish new piece of IKEA furniture.)\nThey distort knowledge, enhance\nits negative characteristics and then use it to destroy their own happiness. Their minds are black\nholes of worry; singularities whose event horizon pulls misery from the\noutside world and traps it forever\nin an infinitely massive point of\nconcentrated pain.\nShakespeare knew. (But he still\ncouldn't spell his own name.) Have\nnot generations of neurotics sym-pathis ed with Hamlet's dilemma of\nlife and death, suicide or revenge;\nhis lonely vigil of patient consider a tion. The science of self-analysis\nwill be familiar to every chronic\nworrier; an endless circle of con-temp la tion, looking for the bright\nside and never finding it; drowning\nmen never finding that elusive\nstraw. For the most extreme cases,\nparanoia creeps in. Many find\nsolace only in death.\nIam a self-confessed neurotic;\na black body radiator of negative\nvibes. Misery is my only real companion. Many hours of my life have\nbeen spent in reclusive isolation,\nsuffering over potential risks that\nothers would dismiss immediately,\nand get on with their everyday\nlives.\nStill, never mind.

To compliment the House of Horror competition,\nhere is a friendly guide on how to avoid\nthe pitfalls of flat hunting and a quick\nadvert for the places you can get help.\nThe essential tip has to be don't panic!\nMistakes are only really made when\npeople jump into arrangements they\nlater regret or sign contracts they can't get out of.\nHere are a few pointers:\nIf you want to start looking early, that's OK, but be aware that prices will go up\nfor the summer and back down in the\nautumn. Start by getting a general idea\nof which estate agents are dealing with\nyour price range. Ask them what they\nnormally have to offer for students. An\nIC list of agents will be available after\nAccommodation Week, try to stick to\nthis.\nWhen you start looking:\nDo not believe agents who say they'll\nphone you back - keep phoning them!\nNever visit a property by yourself, with or\nwithout the agent. Remember, within\n. o<;o^ X&1L uf^ rated,Vteeiiifteamvml\n\u2022 BRIXTON, R001\nfrom Itt December t reason you can look for as long as you\nlike and ask anything you like.\nDo not sign anything unless you are\nreally sure you know what and why you\nare signing, how long will you be\ncommitted to it? e.t.c. When you decide you've found\nthe right place:\nYou can put down a holding deposit to\nthe agent which stops him/her giving the\nflat to anyone else. But, although the\ngood news is that this will be part of your\noverall deposit not an extra payment,\nthe bad news is that you can't change\nyour mind without losing the deposit.\nWhen signing, ideally you should have\nat least one parent or someone who\nknows what they're doing with you.\nTrue or False favourites:\n1. \"I have to pay agents money before\nthey'll check if they have any lets avail-able\" FALSE\n2. \"The inventory is normally signed at\nthe agent's office without checking the\nflat\" FALSE\n3. \"The agent may not let me sign the\nletting agreement\ninventory\" TRUE\nif I don't sign the\n4. \"There is nothing I can do about signing a contract I don't fully agree with\"\nFALSE - limited changes can be made,\nsee below.\n5. \"There is basically only one tenancy\nagreement in use\" TRUE\nIt's the 1988 version but it should say\nFeb. 1996 amendments somewhere\non the front, your agent should supply\nan up-to-date copy.\n6. \"My landlord can let himself in and\nout of my flat as he chooses\" FALSE\nIf you need any more help with\nany of the above contact your\nAccommodation Officer or the\nUnion Advisor - see the back\npage of this newsletter for\ndetails.\nThe Spring edition of the ICU Welfare Newsletter was produced by the Welfare Committee, with assistance from\nMartin Thomson.
