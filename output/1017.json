The call\ncomes two weeks before the\nHouse of Commons is to debate\nstudent hardship.\nLucy Chothia, ICU President, was approached by the\nPresident of the Edinburgh University Students' Union, on\nbehalf of the Ancients\nCampaign, asking students to\nwrite to MPs, before the issue is\ndebated in the Commons.\nThe Ancients Campaign is a pressure group whose membership comprises all those universities established before 1960.\n(elections continues from page one)\nlikely to be difficult. \" The logistics are a nightmare,\"\ncommented Dan Look, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services).\n\"The only sensible option seems\nto me to use the swipe card\nsystem as efficiently as possible.\"\nHowever, the decision will be\nmade by the elections committee, a subcommittee of ICU Council who have full responsibility over the forthcoming\n3-5 callers a day to the new line.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Liz Lanka from the NUS explained\nhow the service works: \" If a student calls up to report an\nincident of fascism, such as\noffensive graffiti, we can give\nadvice on how to get rid of it and\ngive information on how to\nchange policy in their student\nunions so that all graffiti is\nremoved as soon as possible.\"\nMs Lanka said that whilst\nthey hoped to be able to offer\nhelpful counselling and advice,\nthe service was primarily designed as a monitoring service.\nAs part of the continuing NUS Though only part of the\nUniversity of London, the\nAncients Campaign has found\nthat they got a better response\nwhen going straight to Colleges\ninstead of through the\nUniversity of London Union.\nPresenting the motion to\nICU Council last Tuesday, Ms\nChothia suggested that Council\nmembers also bring the rising\nprices of the London Underground to the attention of\nMPs. She hoped that London Underground might consider\noffering student discounts on\nmonthly or weekly travelcards.\nHowever, Council thought that\ndiscussing the London Underground would take\nattention away from other\nelections.\nThe problems stem from the\nmerging of the ICU card and\ncollege security pass. Introduced\nby Rick Bilby, Deputy President\nfrom 1992-1993, the move was\nseen as a way to reduce the\nadministrative burden on ICU staff, although some cynics saw it\nas a way to safeguard ICU in the\nrun up to Government reforms\nof student unions. The result has\nbeen that all students arriving at\nImperial from October 1993 have\nanti-fascism campaign, the\naccumulated information will be\nused to draw attention to the\nscale of the problem on campuses\nthroughout the country.\nEmphasising that the service\ndid not exist to put pressure on\nstudent unions, she said that\nthey hoped to provide an\nenvironment where students\ncould air problems in confidence.\nAlthough Imperial is not an\naffiliated member of the NUS, they have said that calls would\nbe welcomed from students at\nIC. The number to call is (0426)\n942826.\nstudent concerns and the\nsuggestion was thrown out.\nTuesday's Council meeting,\nthe first since the Governing\nBody passed most of the new\nconstitution, brings to an end\none and half years of\nconstitutional change in ICU. The 'Mary's Amendment' was\npassed by an overwhelming\nmajority. Claire Moloney, speaking at Council, said: \"We\nsaw the amendment before it\nwent to the Governing Body and\nwere happy with it.\" Council,\nwhose membership is very\nsimilar to the ICU Council that\nexisted two years ago, replaces\nthe Union General Meeting as a once monthly, sovereign body of\nICU.\na joint ICU/ college security\ncard, whilst new ICU cards are\nissued every year for everyone\nelse.\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool students will be\nunaffected by the trauma at\nSouth Kensington. Due to\nincompatible swipe card systems\nat the South Kensington and\nPaddington campuses, St Mary's students have been issued with\nseparate ICU cards which will be\nhole-punched at ballot boxes.\nStudent\nFraud\nBY RACHEL WALTERS Universities nationwide have\nbeen asked to increase checks on\nstudents as reports of grant fraud\non a 'massive' scale have\nemerged.\nThe Universities and\nColleges Admissions Service\n(UCAS) has identified 700 fake\napplications in the past year as\nfraud ster s attempted to obtain\nthe necessary paperwork to get\ngrants and student loans. These\ncould have netted \u00a31.5 million in\ngrants alone, and UCAS believes\nthat there may be thousands\nmore illegal applications going\nundetected.\nDescribing the fraud as 'big\nbusiness', Tony Higgins, Chief\nExecutive of UC AS, said: ' An individual will register at\nperhaps half a dozen universities\non the same day and then collect\nthe grant. They have computer\nequipment producing high\nquality examination and birth\ncertificates.' He also pointed out\nthat universities themselves\nstood to gain from the fraud, as\nthey would end up receiving\ntuition fees for students that did\nnot attend.\nThe problem is known to\nhave originated in London, but\nit is not clear whether Imperial\nhas been subject to any\nfabricated applications.\nIn a separate development,\nthe beleaguered Student Loans\nCompany (SLC) has come in for\nfurther attack. Already under\nofficial investigation for\nmalpractice, the remit of the\ninquiry has been extended to\ninclude allegations of corruption.\nRon Harrison, the former chief\nexecutive recently replaced by\nex-Imperial rector Sir Eric Ash,\nis thought to have come in for\npersonal criticism. Last year\nclaims emerged that he had\nspent \u00a3600 on whisky for the\nboardroom. However, company\nofficials have insisted that the\nbills were part of legitimate\ncorporate entertainment.\nCouncil to Lobby MPs\nlil B FELIX20 J MI95 "

    "content": "BackChcit\nThe United Colours\nof Sporting Rebellion\nAfter spending his first sixteen years in South Africa, Peter Hain\nmoved to Britain in 1966. He studied Mechanical Engineering at\nImperial for a year before moving to Queen Mary College. He\nbecame the Labour MP for Neath in 1991.\nIt is nothing to be terribly surprised about in\nretrospect. I mean where else would you\nexpect to see Members of Parliament walking\naround except outside the Houses of\nParliament. I'm actually there to interview\nPeter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath but\nbeing early I hang around for a while. Neil\nKinnock motors passed with a big grin and a secretary in tow. On the other side of the road,\nGerald Kaufman sidles by. It's the first time\nI 've seen either man in real life and despite\ntheir numerous telly appearances, they look\nsomehow different in the flesh. Maybe it's that\nthey seem to have human traits instead of\nbeing just party ciphers. Just then Big Ben\nstrikes and it's time to go.\nAfter several different doors, an X ray\nmachine and two guard houses I'm in. I meet\nPeter's secretary and we go into his office. It's a cosy room, smaller than I imagined and the\ndominant feature is the small tv screen bolted\nto the wall. This appears to be for the purpose\nof telling MPs when votes are taking place so\nthey can do their stuff whilst missing out the\nboring speeches. However it doesn't seem to\nchange whilst I'm in the room so I can't be\npositive about that. Peter's on the phone -taking to some journalists as chance would\nhave it. So I get to look around his office some\nmore. There's a large poster of Nelson Mandela broadly smiling and the new South\nAfrican flag in the background. A few pictures\nof Peter in action are dotted around, probably\nengaged in MP business. He finishes with the\nphone and we get started.\nPeter Hain was born in Kenya but his\nparents were leading activists in the South\nAfrican anti apartheid movement who\nhappened to be out of the country for a year.\nHe grew up in South Africa in what could be\ncalled rather trying circumstances. \"Well it\nwas different,\" Peter says. He still has a definite accent and his voice is quiet and slow.\n\"But it was a very happy childhood, which I think is a great tribute to my parents,\nalthough it was unusual in the sense that they\nwere jailed for eleven days at one stage.\"\nIndeed by 1964 both his mother and\nfather were issued with banning orders which\nrestricted their movements and eventually led\nto the family moving back to the UK in 1966.\nSo did he experience political culture\nshock on coming to Britain? \"There was a cultural culture shock\", he laughs. \"I mean for\na start it was cold and wet and I was surprised,\nam nn man mna. Slil i nnnn iiii iii iii iii iii iii ilk i un nil| in in miH[ imi\u00bbHffli\n(iv**\"'!''^\"' \u2022\n<\nit shows you the kind of romantic ignorance\ninvolved, but I was surprised how rundown\nLondon seemed.\" \"Politically it just seemed\nless serious\" he adds, \"politics seemed less\nserious, it was not as life and death as it clearly\nwas in South Africa\".\nFollowing 'A' Level choices of pure and\napplied maths and physics, it seemed that\nPeter was well on the way to becoming an\nengineer. Indeed before coming to Imperial to\ndo Mechanical Engineering he spent an\napprentice year at Lucas. However he was still\nactive in political circles especially in the\nYoung Liberals Movement. So it was that\nwhen it was announced that a( white) South\nAfrican Cricket team were going to tour\nBritain, Peter, also a keen sportsman,\nproposed that the Young Liberals should take\ndirect action to stop the tour taking place.\nFrom that point in January 1969 things\ndeveloped very quickly and by August an\nofficial group was formed. The Stop The\nSeventies Tour (STST) committee was set up\nto organise disruption to the tour. Peter was\ninitially only the spokesman but he soon\nbecame seen as the chairman - at least the\nnewspapers said so.\nHowever at the same time as he was\nrunning around the country disrupting the\nSpringboks' rugby tour, Peter was also a studying at Imperial. Considering our\nreputation as a right wing college, what was it\nlike then? \"Well, you know, I enjoyed my\ntime there\" he says. \"I had an excellent tutor\nand people in my tutor group and my lectures\nwere always friendly although I have to say for\nme Imperial was an academic sort of existence.\nI never spent any time socially there\".\nHowever he did retain some affection for part\nof the Mech. Eng building. \"I'd spend my\nlunch hour on the phone in a call box just\nopposite the mechanical engineering building\n... I used to literally spend every lunch hour with a couple of sandwiches, being phoned\nback by newspapers all over the country and\nby organisers all over the place.\"\nYet after one year Peter decided that\nengineering and Imperial was not for him so\nhe moved to Queen Mary College and studied\nEconomics instead. However the ST ST campaign had been a great success. At its\nheight it had attracted over 3,000 protesters to\na single match and a total of 50,000 over the\nperiod of its organisation. It gained the\nsupport of major unions, caused international\nconcern about the status of the 1970\nCommonwealth Games, created a political hot\npotato within the UK and then finally\nfulfilled its aim. On the 21 May, 1970 the\nM CC finally withdrew their invitation to the\nSouth Africans.\nTwenty five years on, Peter Hain the\nradical student has become Peter Hain the\nrespectable MP. Does he feel limited by the\nfact that he has to work within the system\nnow? \"I was never content with only holding\nup a banner or pursuing a single issue\ncampaign\" he says. \"I always believed in a general political approach because that's the\nway you change society\". So are you still\ninspired to get things done? \"I think it's an\nfantastic job\" he ends. \" My colleagues find it\nvery frustrating but I think it depends as to\nwhether you have any illusions about it ... my\nmoto is you can only get disillusions if you\nhave illusions in the first place.\" Q FELIX "

After the\ndepartures and soloing sabbaticals\nof the last eighteen months, the\ncrowds are split into the Belly and\nKristin Hersh camps. Numerically\nthe Belly camp are much larger,\nbut if the Hersh camp attacked it\nwould probably win, thanks to its\nage and sexual advantages. What\nis more interesting is that both\n'star' and 'hips and makers' sold\nmore copies than any of the\nThrowing Muses albums did when\nboth Tanya Donnelly and Kristin\nHersh played the same drum.\nSo what can Kristin now offer\nher new fan base? Well the\nThrowing Muses are more than just\nKristin with a bassist and drummer.\nBernard Georges and David\nNarcizo are certainly not pretty\nfaces but they flesh out the sound\nthat dominates the heartland of\nthe album. The lyrical tautness\nmaybe characteristic Hersh but\nhere that's less than half the story.\nPersonally I find myself at\nodds with too many single\nselections and the opening 'bright\nyellow sun' is no exception in this\ncase. It's labour ed in tone and the\nchoice of imagery, guns and\npoison, seems to be too obviously\nlinked to hang on the Hersh's schizoid hook. But after this\nmiscreant, you're find little to\nregret in the next eleven tracks.\n'Start' crashes in with a reprise most writers would pay for.\n\"I 'll start at his knees and I 'll end\nin his dreams\" could be about\nalmost anything but if it's seduction you're after, I don't think\nit will fail you. And as single word\naffirmations such as 'shimmer' and\n'hazing' intersperse with delicate\nvignettes like 'calm down, calm\ndown', it becomes easy to get\nswept away.\nThe most obviously Kristian\ntracks are the twin peaks of\n'crab town' and 'that's all you\nwanted'. Where 'crab town' lazes\ninto the distant poignancy that was\nso earnestly displayed on 'hips and\nmakers', 'that's all you wanted'\nraises angelic wings whilst\ncovering its ambiguous meaning.\nYet these two apart, the\nconsistency of 'university' is\nunderpinned by the presence of a band. The downwards rhythm\nprogression of 'hazing' is perhaps\nthe singular example but you get\nthe impression that the slow\nswagger of 'teller' and force of 'no\nway in hell' will give an equally\ngood return with persistent listening as the more accessible tracks.\nPerhaps the overall moral to\naccept is don't live in the past. The\nThrowing Muses are dead. Long\nlive the Throwing Muses. (8)\nKim Gordon is about to take\nthe stage and I'm squashed\nbetween a forest of very tall guys\nand four hundred people who\ncame just to see her. Because Kim\nGordon is such a symbol to me: of\nwomanhood, of age in the youth\nbusiness, of selling rather than\nselling out, I'm terrified that she'll\nbe somehow wrong. Too fat or too\nboring or too young or even too\nugly. All very incorrect of me, all\nvery true. But she's wonderful.\nHandsome at 40, impossible thin\nsnake lidded eyes, dressed in her\n'x girl' brand (pink skirt and black\nfishnet stockings) and purring into\nthe microphone with regal\ncertainty. She's the 'super' in this\nsupergroup, although the others\nplay their part. Julia from Pussy\nGalore provides frenetic polemics,\nMarc from Pavement a loose bass\nand the drummer girl from The\nBoredoms also plays a silver horn.\nThe music is conceptual and free-form: I wouldn't listen to it at\nhome, as they say, but here it\nmakes perfect sense. The mosh\ngets quite violent as does the\nstage. After a poem castigating\nseveral hostile NME hacks, Julia\nlater accepted the challenge of\ncreating a song about ugly men (a suggestion from the floor). After\nciting William Burroughs and\nEverett True as good examples,\nJulia stares out Kim. \"No!\" cries\nKim in mock horror, \"Thurston's cute!\". We all laugh at this little in\njoke, but then all pop music is\ncodified isn't it?\nFree kitten attempt to crack\nthe code with their bit-on-the-side\nproject and succeed, partially. The\nmusic is new, more then a combination of the disparate\ngroup members. But the reason\nwe're ail here is the same. Very\nImportant Indie.\nWhat do Cheap Trick, Syd\nBarrett, a brilliant title track and a crud band name have in common?\nLiving room scene, the new album\nby di il on fence, that's what. For\nfour minutes they breeze their\nCarolina way through an\ninvigorating piece of loud but very\nmelodic guitar rock leaving you\nwith the pleasant premonition that\nyou're going to see two superb\nbands when they support the Black\nCrowes at the Royal Albert Hall.\nOh, and it sounds like Cheap Trick\n(with a soup con of the Faces\nthrown in).\nAnd then, no more. 'Laughs'\nis an instant contradiction - a lackadaisical guitar jangle and\nsweet harmonies providing the\nbackground before the insertion of\na moody, crescendo-ing guitar\nsolo. It's still refreshing though and\nleads into the very Gigolo Aunts-y( and hence Cheap Trick-y again)\n'queen of the in-between'.\nElsewhere, the Syd Barrett\nconnection is consolidated (think:\nGigolo Aunts) via the lilting, early\nFloydian psychedelia of 'high\nschool sap', and that previous\npremonition begins to blossom.\nAlas, it never actually\nmanages to bear fruit because for\nthe last third or so they decide to\ngo lilting a tad too much and end\nup wilting instead. Not that we\nshould end on a negative note. Try\n\"a rather good\" band instead of a \"superb\" one and go to see them\nanyway... (7) 0\nFluffy bras on the Word are where\nit's at. Or so it seems as people\nfrom all walks of life have been\noverheard saying \"fluffy under-wear!\" in varying tones of shock\nand derision. The best (the only?)\nin High St fluffy couture is at AdHoc, where bras are \u00a338 and the\ntheme is extended to dresses\n(snake skin, patent, plastic, rubber\nand leopard) at an equally\nlengthened price. If the student\nloan is looking drained, I say style\nrequires that you grab a Evostick\nand slaughter your teddies.\nUnderwear does seem to be\nthe thing d la moment. Post-war\nslim line dressing in smooth fitting\nmaterial mixes raises the question\nof the Dreaded VLP (visible pantie\nline). Whole shelf units in M&S and\npages in fashion mags are being\ndedicated to the ultimate desire\nicon - the G string. Or, as skirts\nlengthen (to the knee) and tighten,\nthe obvious new alternative is to\ngo without...\nCatwalks this season\nsuggested the renewal of an age\nold concept to ensure a smoother\noverall line, whip out your\ngrandma's long line girdles. For\nthe 90's twist, add a transparent\ndress, stilettoes and little else.\nLovely. What this has done,\nhowever is to potentially\nrejuvenate hot pants. The smaller\nand shinier the better, displayed\nunder the new minis with waist-high front slits (and no thighs!).\nThe post-war influence is\nmassive this spring. Red lips,\ncropped pastel twin sets with\nelbow length sleeves, sleeveless\nshifts and cardigans - tight around\nthe neck or dropped into aV. Cigarette pant trouser suits and\nskinny patent belts emphasise the\nwaist and legs, while rich\ncashmere mixes are on their way\nto supply the glamour. Rustic and\nneutrals are at last pass e( hurrah!!), and replaced with\npastel plastics. Palest lilac, pretty\npinks and luminous transparency\nare set fair as the ways ahead. \u00a9\nE0J009 S FELIX HD "

    "content": "Cat's Tale\nTea For One by Mimi Chakra bor ty There are four waiters in the room\nand precisely two tables are\noccupied. I am at one, and to my\nleft on a raised dais on which the\ngrand piano stands, and reflected\nby a large gilt mirror which fills the\nwall behind them, are a retired\nAmerican couple, Bill and Barbara,\nwhose argument about their\ndaughter Rebecca currently holds\nthe room.\nBetween several pots of tea\nand silver stacks bearing tiers of\nbridge rolls, crumpets and cream\nfancies - \"they're so delicious\",\n\"they're darn small\" - some trifling\nelements of their life history\nemerge. Rebecca has abandoned\nWisconsin in favour of Chicago,\ntaking her two-year-old daughter\nNora but leaving her husband\nMichael behind. The argument\nappears to be an ongoing one, and\nat any rate the fundamental thesis\n- an acceptable degree of juvenile\nfreedom - is left unresolved.\nIn fact, Bill and Barbara and\na third person at the table, a woman, would attract attention\neven without their ongoing narrative because they are, quite\nstrikingly, attired in the same white\nand purple flash shell suits with\nReebok trainers. On the handles of\nthe one unoccupied chair hang two\nmatching travel bags, also in\nexactly matching white purple, one\nfor Him, one for Her. On its seat\nyet another has tipped over,\nrevealing its contents: a packet of\nHandi-Wipes, a make-up bag and\nsome Evian facial spray.\nBetween them a trio of waiters perform an elegant gavotte of\npouring, serving and replacing. The\ndevice of afternoon tea is a complex one requiring separate spoons,\nforks, tongs and tea-strainers. The\nsilver pots have hot handles and\nemploy white linen napkins in\norder to be lifted, likewise the\nslightly smaller pots of water.\nPart of what is striking about\nthis incidental theatre is that it\ninvolves a quite serious effort of will\nto be any one of the parties involved - in other words to ignore completely the presence of the others.\nThe waiters, one can imagine,\nwould execute the same series of\nmovements if they were serving an\nempty table, while the diners must\nbehave as though the cups and\nsaucers are moving themselves. Of\nthe three at the table, only Bill\nsucceeds at the game; both his\nfemale companions snag the\nrhythm with anxious shifting and\nmurmured thank you's and attempts to do things for themselves.\nWhen the bill arrives,\nenclosed in an embossed leather\nwallet, Bill reaches for a brown\nleather body pouch and hands a credit card to the waiter without\nlooking at him. The waiter is young\nbut tall with dark hair and slender\nhands. He helps Barbara with her\njacket, the zip of which has got\ncaught up in her hair.\nAs it happens, the particular\nenvironment which yields this\npattern of manners is the Chinese\nconservatory at the Lanesborough\nHotel, on the corner of Hyde Park\nCorner and Park Lane. It is four-thirty, it is a bank holiday, it is\nraining. As the afternoon light slips\nfrom blue to yellow to grey, fat\ndroplets slap against the conservatory roof which looks up into an\ninternal courtyard. The enforced\nhumidity of the room and the\nresulting condensation have provided fertile corners for mildew and\nmoss which, although cleaned\naway on the inside, have taken\nhold of the exterior, and which,\nwith a necklace of weeds, frame\nthe sky.\ncourt of George IV the Prince\nRegent, which is now the Brighton\nPavilion, a building whose curlicues\nand Turkish verandas might also be\nconsidered oxymoron ic against the\nlocal colour.\nUntil 1980, the Lanesborough was the site of the old St\nGeorge's hospital, and before that\nit started life in 1719 as James\nLane's design for a town house for\nthe second Viscount Lanesborough.\nThe hotel has been open only four\nyears, but has the distinction - at\nfive thousand pounds per night - of\noffering London's most expensive\nsuite (a single room for a single\nnight will put you out by one hundred and fifty pounds, by the way).\nIt is possible to walk past the\nbuilding several times without\nnoticing it and several times more\nwithout identifying it as a hotel;\nthere is no choice of a swing door\nor a rotating one, there are no\nsteps leading upwards, no signs for\ncredit cards accepted or AA stars\naccrued. It could be mistaken, in\nsombre Belgravia cream, for an\nembassy or a club or even a private\nThe hotel has the distinction of offering London' s most expensive suite, at five thousand pounds per night. The conservatory has an\nunusual, Oriental design, enhanced\nby painted paper lanterns and\nChinese baskets which hang from\nthe sky. In fact it is quite possible to\nimagine brightly coloured exotic\nbirds flapping and crowing in the\nupper branches of the trees and\nhuge bowls of flowers which sit in\nbrass bowls across the room.\nAt eye level, however, the\ncarpet of white linen and sparkling\nglassware prevails. The gliding\nwaiters and china cups and the\ndiscreet twinkle of silver on glass let\nslip an ambition for a very\nparticular European aristocratic\ndecadence, which is visceral ly at\nodds with William Wilkins' lush\nManchurian suggestion.\nThat this is not really a problem, that a contradiction of\narchitecture and design is in no\nway out of character with the\ncontradictions of the hotel itself, is\nthe unintentional message which\ntime spent in the conservatory\nconveys. (As it happens Wilkins'\ndesign was after the style of the\nhouse, but what it resembles most\nexactly is one of those anonymous\npalla dian mansions like the\nMansion House or the buildings\nframing Admiralty Arch, whose\npresence is tolerated by the tax-payer, but whose function is never\nfully explained.\nActually there is only one\ndoorway, small, and one doorman,\ncourteous. The marble hall is\nnarrow - more than two people\ncould not walk in comfort - and\npasses an open fireplace, above\nwhich a dark oil painting depicting\nan English racing scene looks\nacross to the dining room which,\nalthough partly closed off, reveals\nthat the dominant theme is Parisian\nboudoir pink.\nThe accessible parts of the\nhotel attempt to retain the style of a large formal house. The bar is in\nThe Library, and has the Brooke's Brothers style of an Ivy League\nclub. The books in the floor-to-ceiling bookcases are, in a way\nwhich might prove disappointing,\npainted boxes in the style of first\neditions. Scotch on the rocks arrives\non a silver tray with a plate of hors\nd'oe uvres and minute linen napkin.\nThere are no public tele-phones, no newspaper stand, and,\nquite disabling ly, no kiosk where\none might nip in to buy emergency\nTampax, Nurofen or condoms. In\nfact there is no evidence that money changes hands anywhere at all.\nIt strikes, finally, that the kind\nof people who might find security\nat the Lanesborough - as opposed\nto its flashier Park Lane neighbours\n- might be the kind of people\nwhose lives accept a degree of\npretended status, and who, in fact\n,infer it as real. Who require, to oil\nthe wheels between meetings and\ndrivers and wives and airports, the\nlubricant of one-on-one deference\nfrom a sequence of attentive\ninferiors. The kind of people who\nmight not, as it happens, spot the\nerror in placing an English racing\nscene above a roaring fire opposite\na pink boudoir and looking down\non a red, green and gold rug\nbearing a pattern of Oriental\ndragons.\nThe design of the hotel,\nthough empirically haphazard, is\nquite specific in its intention, and\non the evidence, quite successful.\nWhere it most succeeds is in\nsupporting a particular self-deception, deriving from the belief\nthat rank and status are essentially\ndeserving, and it is the purveying of\nthis, finally, which is being paid for.\nAs it happens it is not true.\nAs it happens, to interpret the\nconflicting messages of the\nLanesborough Hotel and therefore\nto fully derive its pleasures, it is\nnecessary to be quite seriously\npoor. It is necessary, on the\ngrounds of a quite appalling credit\nrating, to have been denied any\none of the credit cards which the\nhotel is happy to accept. It is\nnecessary to have been toying, over\na period of several hours, with a single pot of tea, long gone cold.\nAnd to have omitted, on the\ngrounds of an over-familiarity with\ntea bags, to make use of the tea-strainer (an action which results in\nimmediate confiscation by a waiter\nof the cold cup with bits floating in\nit, and the production of a fresh\none by another).\nWhat results is a particular\ntype of understanding, and\nconsequently, of security, which\nyields only out of having nowhere\nreally to go on a wet misery-soaked\nday, in a sleep walking city with\nproblems one would rather forget,\nand bills unpaid.\n2 0 J195 FELIX MM\n\n"

What\nnext? Turn the Queen's tower into\na beacon to guide planes down to\nHeathrow? The Union move not\nonly exemplifies the general trend\nin this College for increased\ncentralised control, but also bodes\nof an ill future for the students. A future which may well be devoid of\nany student control over the\nservices we pay for, such as the\nUnion entertainments and Sports\nCentre facilities (The Union lent the\nCollege over half a million pounds\n- at a non-existent interest rate -with which to renovate!) It would\nbe an easy step for the College to\ntake full control of the Union's services and eventually disband it\nentirely. Gone are the days of the\nrebellious student spirit, I grant you\nthat. But Beit Quad is more than\njust a symbol for the\nstudent/college separation - it\ndefines the autonomy we are\nentitled to and stands as the last\nbastion of student independence.\nDan Look (Deputy President\nFinance) told FELIX that a referendum is possible. I say he\nowes it to the student body to\ndecide such matters, although I hope it never has to come to that.\nDavid Cohen\nDoC PG\nWell, the removal of the post of\nCollege Managing Director and the\nnew Deputy Rector may hint at a brighter future.

    "content": "Feature\nOne Hundred Years After The\nDestruction of Imperial\nMike Newman celebrates the life and character of T.H. Huxley One hundred years ago, 1895, three significant\nevents took place. As always, with events that are\nchosen as triplets, they contained both\ncontradiction and irony. One was the birth of a man as a writer; his first novel was published, and it\ncould be seen as one of the first great modern\nscience fiction books. In the same year his greatest\nteacher died at the age of seventy. The writer's later\nnovels were to celebrate this teacher, a brilliant\nscientist and educator.\nThe third event links the two; the disturbing\nimage of the first motorised flight. Two scientists,\nintrepid inventors, Monson and Woodhouse, fly the\nfirst aeroplane over London. As they pass over\nKilburn and Hampstead they lose control of the\nplane and...\n\"So swiftly had the thing happened that\nbarely a quarter of the people going to and fro in\nHyde Park and Brompton Road, and the Exhibition\nRoad saw anything of the aerial catastrophe...\nFor perhaps half a minute, the pointed stem\nof the big machine still raised vertically upward, the\nscrew spinning desperately. For one brief instant,\nthat yet seemed an age to all who watched, it hung\nmotionless in mid-air. Then a spout of yellow flame\nlicked up its length from the stern engine, and\nswift, swifter, swifter, and flaring like a rocket, it\nrushed down upon the solid mass of masonry which\nwas formerly the Royal\nCollege of Science..\"\nThe short story,\n'Argonauts of the Air', published in 1895 by an ex-student of Imperial College,\nends with the devastated\nruins of the college and its\nStudent's Club as a monument to the 'gallant\nexperiment a lists' and to 'the\ndesperate struggle for man's right of way through the air'.\nThe writer was H.G. Wells, and his teacher was\nProfessor T.H. Huxley, Dean of the Royal College\nof Science. The book was 'The Time Machine'.\nWhy did Wells celebrate the image of his\ncollege by destroying it in 1895? This image of\ndestruction was a reversal of the view Wells had of\nhis a i mer mater. To him the College destroyed\nscience by training students as technicians in the\nskills of science, and cramming them with\nknowledge, meanwhile destroying its heart and\nsoul. This heart and soul, was represented by his\ntwo heroes, with their imaginative creativity.\n'Argonauts of the Air' has true scientists accidently\ndestroying the threat to their science.\n...it is true now, as\never it was, that the\npeople perish for\nlack of knowledge.\"\nWells' image of science can be found\npervading nearly all his short stories and novels.\nThe background to this is his student days at the\nRoyal College of Science, then called the Normal\nSchool of Science, and a place dedicated to\nproducing science teachers for the newly created\nstate school system. Wells was a trainee science\nteacher, having won a scholarship while teaching as\na junior master.\nT.H. Huxley taught Wells during his first\nyear. Their classroom and laboratory, described in\n'Love and Mr Lewisham', is situated on the top\nfloor of the 'Henry Cole Wing' of the V&A. This\nbuilding was the Normal School of Science. Here\nHuxley taught with great enthusiasm, refusing to\naccept more lucrative teaching jobs at other\nUniversities, and in America. He believed in the\nfuture role and importance of Imperial College and\nSouth Kensington.\nIn his teaching he used beautiful models,\nmade in Paris, that can still be seen in the College\nArchives. He believed it was the responsibility of\nthe teacher to free the minds of students from\ndogma and lack of thought.\n'The politicians tell us, \" You must educate\nthe masses because they are going to be masters\".\nThe clergy join in the cry for education, for they\naffirm that people are drifting away from the church\nand chapel into the broadest infidelity. The\nmanufacturers and the capitalists swell the chorus\nlustily. They declare that ignorance makes bad\nworkmen; that England will soon be unable to turn\ncotton goods, or steam engines cheaper than other\npeople; and then, Ichabod! Ichabod! The glory will\nbe departed from us. And a few voices are lifted up\nin favour of the doctrine that the masses should be\neducated because they are men and women with\nunlimited capacities of being, doing, and suffering,\nand that it is true now, as ever it was, that the\npeople perish for lack of knowledge.' - A Liberal\nEducation and Where to Find it, 1868 (Professor T.H. Huxley)\nHe worked on Government committees on\neducation, he wrote textbooks, one of which was for\nLondon schools, on how to use the local landscape\nto teach geology, geography and human geography.\nHe believed you teach the child by starting with\nwhat they already know, using what is familiar to\nthe child, and by the child actively doing things.\nHe was on the first London School Board, despite\nprotests from the Church. And he even successfully\nthreatened to resign if the Board agreed to fund\nChurch Schools. For this was the man that coined\nthe term 'Agnostic' for his beliefs. He believed in\nthe idea that truth was something you should\nalways be able to test, open to scrutiny and\n0\n1\n2 FELIX20 JAI195 "

    "content": "ultimately to verification. God and the afterlife\nwere not open to testing and therefore not a part of\nknowledge.\nAfter his first son had died at the age of four,\njust after Christmas (indeed near the date when he\nhad been born - his name was Noel) and with\nHuxley's wife being a devout Christian, Huxley\ncorresponded with the vicar and writer, Charles\nKingsley. Kingsley, who admired Huxley enormously, wanted to convert him and wrote soon\nafter Noel's death to this end. Huxley's response, a few weeks after this tragic bereavement tells us of\nthe nature of this man;\n\" My Dear Kingsley - I cannot sufficiently\nthank you, both on my wife's account and my own,\nfor your long and frank letter, and for all the hearty\nsympathy it exhibits... My convictions, positive and\nnegative, on all the matters of which you speak, are\nof long and slow growth and are firmly rooted. But\nthe great blow which fell upon me seemed to stir\nthem to their foundation... I have searched over the\ngrounds of my belief, and if wife and child and\nname and fame were all to be lost to me one after\nthe other as penalty, still I will not lie.\n... But the longer I live, the more obvious it is\nto me that the most sacred act of a man's life is to\nsay and feel, \"I believe such and such to be true.\"...\nThe universe is one and the same throughout; and\nif the condition of my success in unravelling some\nlittle difficulty of anatomy or physiology is that I shall rigorously refuse to put faith in that which\ndoes not rest on sufficient evidence, I cannot believe\nthat the great mysteries of existence will be laid\nopen to me on other terms...\nAs I stood behind the coffin of my little son\nthe other day, with my mind bent on anything but\ndisputation, the officiating minister read, as part of\nhis duty, the words, \"If the dead rise not again, let\nus eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\" I cannot\ntell you how in express i bly they shocked me...\n...As our laws stand, if the lowest thief steals\nmy cost, my evidence (my opinions being known)\nwould not be received against him.\nBut I cannot help it. One thing people shall\nnot call me with justice, and that is - a liar. As you\nsay of yourself, I too feel that I lack courage; but if\never the occasion arises when I am bound to speak,\nI will not shame my boy...\"\nHuxley represents a symbol of science as\nenquiring of truth but reflecting upon what truth\nmeans and how it affects the rest of our lives. He\nwas a great writer; a biography of Huxley was\nincluded in the series of volumes on ' Modern English Writers', published by Blackwood,\nalongside George Eliot, Browning and Dickens.\nHis life is about the relationship between education,\nscience, art and politics. He, of all people,\nencompasses the history and meaning of the South\nKensington complex of museums and institutions.\nHis student, Wells, has left us the romantic legacy\nof his novels and short stories that examine these\nissues.\nThere can be no finer opportunity for\nImperial College and all the other institutions to\nreflect upon themselves, their past and their present\nrelationships, through a celebration of Huxley and\nWells.\n\"The longer I live, the more obvious it is\nto me that the most sacred act of a man's life is to say and feel, 'I believe such and\nsuch to be true/ \"\nI urge those students who are excited about ;\nthe nature of science and its relationship with i human knowledge and creativity, as celebrated by I the buildings, if not the institutions of South i Kensington (read the inscription around the roof of j the Albert Hall and you will be surprised!) to help i organise events for next year. We need the re- j starting of the Huxley Society, which I founded in i1992. Leave your names in the Students Union j Office and sign a motion asking for the society to be i refounded. It needs only 20 signatures, I think. ;\nMichael Newman, Imperial College Alumni, Science \\\nTeacher, Teacher of English in Italy.

It's okay, but original is not a word that s(i. ly to mind.\nThe Martyrdom of St. Erasmus [1628-29]\nThe most arresting sight in this\nexhibition is the first painting on\nshow. One entering the circular\nanteroom at the Royal Academy,\ndown looms Poussin's the martyrdom of st. erasmus. A christ like figure falls out of the canvas as a group of men crowd about the\nsaint. They are slowly pulling out\nhis intestines and winding them\naround a windlass. It's not what\nyou expect from Nicolas Poussin,\n(1594-1665), considered the\ngreatest French painter of his age.\nYet the choice of subject is not at\nvariance with the rest of the\nexhibition. After failing to win\npublic acclaim with this work (it was\ninconceivably ordered as an altar-piece), Poussin had to paint for\nprivate patrons. Therefore he\npossessed a much freer rein to\nexpress his own choice of topics\nthan other artists of his day.\nAlthough born in France,\nPoussin spent most of his working\nlife in Rome, drawing heavily on\nthe Renaissance and antiquity as\nsubject matter. Indeed of the nine\ngalleries making up this exhibition\nall but one fall into the categories\nof biblical or scenes from antiquity.\nPerhaps it was his early work\nthat is now most admired. Taking\nsuch stories as Venus and Adonis\nand Echo and Narcissus, Poussin\npainted scenes of tragic and futile\nhumanism. Within such works,\nrivers are personified, the cherubic\nput ti float about the skies dropping\nflowers and satyrs drunkenly fool\nwith bac chant e. To that extent both\nthe stories and Poussin's portrayals\nof them are laced with the wi ff of\ndecadence. This too is reflected in\nthe biblical scenes as the classical\ntouches are introduced as allegories ie in the triumph of david a winged victory hands him an oak\nwreath as cupid plays the harp!\nHowever Poussin is best known\nfor his classical landscapes. They\nstill retain the previous themes but\nenhance them by placing the much\nsmaller figures within the realm of\nnature. Yet for Poussin this nature\nwas as domestic as the architectural details he often used both on\nfore and backgrounds. It has been\nwell said that his world was \"all\nsolid, cubes and cones of landscape\nand cloud ... everything remains\ngrasp able by man\".\nThe last works he carried out\nwere a series on the four seasons\nwhich highlighted biblical themes\nsuch as winter - the deluge. It was\nan appropriate end to his career.\nYet Poussin seems to be best\nplaced as a precursor to others.\nCertainly this is an interesting\nexhibition but this would seem to\nbe more for historical reasons than\nthe deeper excitements that are\ngenerally associated with Art. 0\nMM FELIX20 JIH195 "

    "content": "Standby\n\u00a9 the ravings of a demented irishman?^ class Judging from this latest rendition of\nthe Dracula myth, vampires are\nkeen on theatrical s. Avoid dark\nstreets on the way home from\ninterview with the vampire, because your vampire film-goer will\nbe a cross vampire.\nIt's1791, and Brad Pitt is Louis,\nthe disconsolate owner of a New\nOrleans plantation. He's lost his\nwife in childbirth, and has little to\nlive for when an extrovert but lonely\nvampire offers him eternal youth.\nSo Louis becomes a reluctant\nvampire in the graveyard where his\nwife is buried. Vampire vision shows\nhim the statue on her grave slowly\nopening its eyes, but the film never\nmakes anything of this aspect of\nAnne Rice's novel.\nThe two hungrily cruise New\nOrleans' bars by night. Tom Cruise,\nexcellent as Lestat, concentrates on\njuicy women, with gorgeous young\nmen for seconds, but for a long\ntime Brad's conscience allows him\nonly rats, chickens and poodles.\nTheir relationship's less father-son\nand more camp, except that Brad\nPitt's rather dreary. He pines. To\ncheer him up, Lestat makes a vampire out of Claudia, a tattered\norphan of the plague slums. Brad\nhas torched his mansion in a fit of\nthe blues - and the first of many\nglorious fires in the film - but they\napparently have sufficient funds for\nClaudia's education (and boy does\nshe run through piano teachers).\nInitially she's a vile lisping brat, but\nyou warm to her because she gets\nall the best gags. Anyhow, Lestat\nruns the household, but gets rather\noverbearing, and positively unsympathetic when Claudia realises\nshe'll never grow up. (All vampires\nhave long hair, apparently, and I thought this a good gap in the\nmarket for a specialist hairdresser\nFELIX until Claudia's ringlets sprung right\nback the moment she cut them off.)\nClaudia masterminds an\nescape by tempting Lestat with\nblood from dead meat, an absolute\nno-no for vampires. She and Brad\ntip his body into a swamp and whisk\noff to Paris in time for the next\ncentury. This is an opportunity for\nlots of Les Liaisons Dangereuses\noutfits and the 'French Accent\nDepartment', as Claudia has a fabulous time social ising and Louis\nsearches high society for European\nvampires. However, when they turn\nup, they're a bit too naughty for\nBrad, the vampire with a human\nsoul. In fact, Brad's rather drip py, and we never see him eat in public\nagain. In the book, Louis has an\naffair with Armand, a cultured\nParisian vampire; in the film they\nmeet a couple of times before Brad\nmopes off to the rest of Europe on\nhis own, upset with all that old\nworld decadence.\nBack in the twentieth century,\nBrad returns to America. He follows\na faint sniff of vampire, which turns\nout to be Lestat, alive after all, but a bit shaky. Leaving Lestat hiding out,\nBrad decamps to San Francisco and\ntells his story to journalist Christian\nSlater. Slater's excited by the scoop\n(suspense-lovers stop here), jumps\ninto his car, and guess what?\nThe scenery's lush throughout,\nbut the film jumps from rioting\nslaves to sucking prostitutes' blood\nto doll shops to vampire gang-rapes\nto parent-child scenes, which rather\nwastes the audience's feelings.\nLouis' first rat-eating attempts are\nfun, like the Claudia scenes,\nmaking the film agreeable, if jerky.\nIt's certainly a blockbuster - from\nNeil Jordan, director of 'Crying\nGame'( arthouse turned big\nsuccess) - but would probably have\nbeen better if Anne Rice hadn't written the script. Authors never\nhave the guts to edit firmly. Tom\nCruise is almost un recognisable and\nsuperb as an antidote to Louis'\ndreary narrative; a more interesting\nactor than Brad Pitt might have had\ntrouble with stodgy Louis. Neither\nCruise nor Pitt are likely to\nan tag on is e female fans with the\nsupposed homo erotica: it's hardly\ndeveloped and easy to miss in all\nthe scene-shifting. As for the film\nbeing a lament for the days when\nyou could suck all the blood you\nwanted without getting AIDS, give\nme a break.\nIn shallow grave, Alex, Juliet\nand David are looking for a flat mate. However, shortly after he\nhas moved in, they find him in bed\ndead, naked, and in possession of a suitcase containing a large amount\nof money. They decide to keep the\nmoney and conceal the body by\ndismembering and disfiguring it\nbefore burying it in a \"shallow\ngrave\".\nThe film begins with an\namusing scene in which the three\nmain characters are interviewing\nprospective flat mates. However,\nafter the discovery of the dead\nbody, the film suddenly becomes\nvery bleak; the proposal and\nexecution of the plan to mutilate\nand bury the body leaves the\naudience feeling uncomfortable (at\ntimes, the audience may feel that\nthey are laughing in the wrong\nplaces)\nWithout 'big name' actors and\nbecause of its storyline, Shallow\nGrave undoubtedly lacks the\ncommercial appeal of some of its\nAmerican competitors currently on\nrelease. Nevertheless, it's a well-made film which is extremely well\nacted. 0\n[nb due to unforeseen stupidity, the author of the\nInterview with the Vampire review was not tintin but KC We apologise to everyone - alright now?]\nPolish food is not just potatoes. In\nfact very few potatoes appear on\nthe menu at Ognisko Polskie in\nSouth Kensington. Instead you are\npresented with an enticing but\nexpensive insight into the delights\nof Polish food.\nThe setting is stunning, fit for\nany Polish aristocrat who happens\nto walk by. The pink and gold\ndining room with windows onto\nthe lawn outside sets off the\nbeautifully presented and served\nmenu.\nThe pickled herrings with sour\ncream, sweet onion and black\nbread (\u00a32.50) provide a staggering start to the meal. The\nherrings are soft, salty and\nsucculent, making the English roll\nmop look like a peasant in\ncomparison.\nFor main course the choice of\ntraditional Polish fare is infiltrated\nby an occasional continental dish.\nHowever, the roast goose served\nwith red cabbage and potato\ndumpling (\u00a311.50) was unquestionably Eastern European. Its\ncombination of flavour, texture\nand colour went straight to the\ngastronomic G spot. This was\nexciting food, perfectly cooked and\npresented in large, attractive\npotions.\nLeaning towards the\ncontinental side of the menu, the\nbeef with potato roast and\ncaramelized shallots (\u00a311.50) was\nsimple cooking, elevated to\nexceptional heights. The beef was\nbeautifully pink in the middle and\nextremely light on the jaw. The\npotato roast was disappointingly\nsoggy but still highly enjoyable\nand the shallots added a sweet\nedge to the meal.\nFor dessert the cheesecake is\npossibly the best in London. This is\na traditional cheesecake, baked in\nthe oven and served in a satisfying\nwedge big enough for two. Its\ntexture was scrumptious: light but\ncreamy with a sweet, cheesy, melt\nin the mouth taste. With sultanas\ndotted throughout and a crunchy\nchocolate coating, this provided\nthe perfect end to an almost\nperfect meal.\nTo fault the food at Ogniska's is extremely difficult. The prices\nreflect the skill, time and effort\nthat go into each dish. It is an\nabsolute pleasure to eat here, so if\nyou want a treat, go along and for\na couple of hours you can be that\nPolish aristocrat. \u00a9\nOgniska Polskie, 55 Princes' Gate,\nExhibition Road, SW7\n\n"

    "content": "News and Editorial\nImperial College Top Funded\nBY ANDREW LONG Imperial students have the most\nfunding, according to a report in\nlast week's Times Higher Education Supplement. IC, receives \u00a3404 per student above\nthe average level of support, \u00a371\nmore per student than 2nd placed Oxford and a massive\n\u00a3998 more per student than\nLuton.\nThe Higher Education Funding Council for England\n(HEFCE), regulates the funding\nby assessing each university in\n15 subject groups. Following the\npublication of their latest\nassessment, HE FCE have come\nunder fire for using a seemingly\nunfair system. Critics say that it\nis difficult to gauge the real size\nof the discrepancies, as\nuniversities teaching predominantly science and technology courses are clearly going\nto receive more funding than\nthose which centre on the\nhumanities.\nNonetheless, there is a remarkable variation in financing levels within specific\nsubjects. While each of our\nengineers rake in a most\nwelcome \u00a32738, Bournemouth\nengineers are allocated just\n\u00a31362 per student.\nThe figures are drawing\nconsiderable censure from the\nuniversities which appear at the\nbottom of the table. HE FCE is\napparently attempting to narrow\nthe range of funding by applying\nharsher efficiency criteria to the\nmore generously funded\nuniversities, but it will be 15-20\nyears before the current range\ndrops to within5% of the\naverage. Commenting on the\nsituation, Peter Knight, ViceChancellor of the University of\nCentral England, described the\nstrategy as, 'one of HEFCE's less\ndynamic policies'.\nSpeculation within IC is that\nimpoverished Imperial students\nwill be considerably consoled,\nknowing that the college receives\nsuch great sums of cash on their\nbehalf.\ne< ii/. riaLA Willful Week\nIt has been one of those weeks\nthat weekends were designed for.\nOn Monday I decided to increase\nthe number of pages to twenty\nfour which was possibly over-stretching our second week of\nterm capabilities. (Careful\ninspection of the newspaper\nbefore you will reveal that any\npage increase must occur in increments of four). It's a FELIX editor's worst dilemma - jump or\ncut? Being a brave lad I jumped.\nThanks fate. This week news\nwas largely elsewhere and if sport\nhappened we didn't hear about it.\nAn article was cut at the last\nminute and the white space piled\nup. To top it all, the coll at or( the\nmachine that folds and staples) is\nbroken and the supposedly\ncourier ed part replacement that\nour skilled technicians (ie. a post grad with a talent for taking\nthings apart, and an optimistic\nview towards his re-assembly\nabilities) eagerly await is yet to\narrive.\nIf this issue reaches you\nwithout staples I fear there has\nbeen a motorway collision of\nsome sort.\nI know no-one likes a moa ner but it's been a good few\nweeks since I last w hinged so\npoor me, poor me, boo-hoo-hoo.\nPlee for more people\nFollowing on from my tantrum\nabove, I'd like to extend the\nwarm hand of friendship to\nanyone who has any ideas they\nwould like to implement in FELIX. Do you have an\nunbeatable column concept or a series of features you'd like to\nwrite? Perhaps you're a photographer or an illustrator\nwho would like to see his work in\nprint? You' ll find I have an\nenthusiastic ear towards all\nsuggestions - and have a few\nideas I'd like to see achieved if\nanyone feels they'd like to write.\nCome in and make a change.\nOwain's Curse\nI think I may have a gift for\nbringing out the worst in people.\nConsider my flat mates. All extremely able and intelligent\npeople. All completely clueless as\nto what they will be doing next\nyear.\nThe first to suffer was ' PD'.P D had a promising career in\nfront of him as a capitalist and\nmaterialist: the future looked\nbright. Foolishly in a moment of\nweakness I read him 'Aubade' by\nPhilip Lark ena mature\nadolescent's poem about death\nand pointlessness. \"It's all\npointless,\" cries PD.\" I don't want a high powered job - I just\nwant a job as a cinema\nattendant.\"\nI met JJ last year in this\noffice. As well as taking my own\nlife down a dubious course, my\nsabbatical has allowed this young\nfirebrand (with a Masters and\nholder of a first class degree in\naeronautics) to charge around all\nday producing work for spurious\npublications and listening to the\n'witless jabbering s of indie-music' (Alexander, 1994).\nMaybe it's the hair. MA should at least have been\nimmune. This high flyer had his\nsights set on the horizons where\nmy sun sets. Surely he'd be\nimmune to the Mcjob syndrome?\n(Mcjob - Menial, low wage, low\nprospects employment). Apparently not. He's decided MIT is\nnot for him and has considering\nstarting a business with me at the\nend of the year.\nA Mcjob if ever there was\none.\nThe Veal Deal\nSo people are sitting down in front of lorries to save veal calves\nare they? Does anyone else find it\ndisturbing the lengths the British\npublic will go to to be the most\nhypocritical nation on Earth? A French politician apparently\nsmirked with a sigh of 'Ah, those\nBritish', when told of our sudden\nhorror at the treatment of the\ncalves. I have nothing against\ncampaigning for animal rights\nbut couldn't the campaigns\nbecome a little less erratic? At least the continentals seem to\nhave some consistency in their\ntreatment of animals.\nIt is well known that Hitler\nwas a vegetarian: I wonder\nwhether the Germans and\nScandinavians also consider\nthemselves to be the kindest\nnation to animals. There is an old\ntheory in art that the English\nRomantics painted landscapes\nbecause they sym pathis ed with\nnature whereas to the south, the\nRomantic latin artists of Spain,\nFrance and Italy avoided\nlandscapes to paint human\nfigures. It was at best useful for\nstopping their human subjects\nfrom dropping off the canvas.\nDoes the same hold for\nanimals - are they just props and\nchops those countries?\nSituation Vacant FELIX requires a new Seven Day Diary sub editor after the current one fled due to other commitments.

Silence prevails in and around Beit\nhall, the Union office is\nclosed, there are a handful\nof people in Da Vinci's.

But\nas soon as I reach the Concert Hall, all worries die away as I am about to enjoy a three-hour rehearsal to its full, while my voice is\njoining the other low-voice men in\" Oh Fatherland...\"\nAll those of you who have noticed the\nposters around College know what \"Cabaret\",\n\"Le Cabaret\" or \"Das Kabarett\" is. The\nmajor Operatic Society production for this\nyear, scheduled for five performances from\nthe 31st of January till the 4th of February\ninclusive.\nCabaret. The word itself in everyday\nusage usually conjures up pictures of seedy\nstrip joints on dimly lit streets, or night-clubs\nwhere the ex h orbit ant price of drinks is\nrarely linked to the meagre stage fare. To these images, the musical and the film\nCabaret have added a grim aura of Weimarian\ndecadence and a hint of satire. These versions\nof Cabaret are distant relatives of the literary\nCabaret which emerged in France in the 19th century and blossomed into a unique medium for political and cultural satire in Paris\nand (later on) Berlin, Munich and elsewhere\nin Germany. Common ground is the presence\nof spectacle and an intimate space in which\npeople can smoke and talk, eat and drink.\nOur team has been aiming to mix all flavours\nin various ways and proportions, and thus to\nFELIX produce something unique, and very enjoy-able!\nThe action opens in a Deutsche\nReichsbahn train from Paris to Berlin at the\nbeginning of the Thirties when Clifford\nBradshaw, a young American writer, meets\nErnst Ludwig, a pleasant man who surprises\nCliff by putting his briefcase among Cliffs\nluggage when they reach the German border.\nIn return for Cliffs discretion Ernst gives\nhim an address in Berlin where he'll definitely find a room, Fraulein Schneider's house.\nCliff begins teaching Ernst English and, on\nthe New Year's Eve they go to the Kit Kat Club, where he meets Sally Bowls an English\ngirl working there as a dancer.\nThe KitKat Club is now the stage, where\nthe Master of Ceremonies along with the\nKitKat Girls (who are neither respectable nor\nwearing much!) take us through the story.\nCliff and Sally fall in love, and she moves into\nFraulein Schneider's house with him, where\nthey meet Herr Schultz, a Jewish fruit seller courting Fl. Schneider, Fraulein Kost, an\namiable mistress who specialises in sailors,\nand other characters of a fairly sleazy period\nin Berlin's history. Gradually Cliff begins to\nsee the black clouds of Nazism gathering, and\nat the same time everyone else has a funny\nfeeling that something very bad is about to\nhappen...\nI would tell you more but I have the feeling that the tall, thin fellow with the black\ncape and the scythe who is shadowing me is\nnot Death, but my Director!\nSeriously though, Amanda is not such a frightful person at all (believe me) and she\nhas been the driving force behind this pro-duct ion, as has Jonathan, our Musical Director. Our team of actors and dancers\nhave been working very intensively to produce a good show. The fact that we all had an\nenormous amount of fun in doing this\nensures that the show will be a success. Above\nall I'd like to thank everybody involved for\nsome of the most brilliant evenings at College\nthis year. Guys and Girls, warm up for the\nfinal rehearsals and the performances! As for\nyou, we'll be waiting to serve you at the\nKit Kat Club the nights of 31st of January,\n1st,2 nd,3 rd,4 th and 5th of January...\nMLJUQOG\nFilm Society Update Keys: Pulp Fiction, Exorcist The next films to be shown at ICU Cinema\nwill not be until February, due to the production of Cabaret by Opsoc.

Other benefits do exist, since we do\nget to see the occasional preview; a few of us\nsaw the new Star Trek film the other week.\nIt's a cracking film, but you will have to wait\ntill February to see it in the West End.\nWeek's Entertainment Guide Keys: Comedy, Disco, Bar, Quiz Tonight (Fri 20th) Comedy, Atmosphere\nThe events lounge is converted briefly into a laid back cabaret venue for the return of the\n\"Bust-a Gut\" comedy club with Dan Freedman, mast ur bator y insight from Tony\nBurgress, and that infamous raconteur\nMatthew Hardee.

Novels arrived via\nbiography to provide us with the most\nincisive form of self-contemplation the\nhuman race has yet discovered. In the\ncourse of time words have assumed a pre-eminent place in society as the\nrepository of'truth': in the courts, the\nschool room and the paperback. But\nwriters such as James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and \u00ae Jaqu.e s Dem da have seen through\nthe veneer of authority carried by the\nliterary cannon and attempted to find\nnew ways of writing. In addition\nt Q post'modern theory has undermined\nthe traditional view of the author-reader\nrelationship. Books are on the run.\nThe De const mc tion is t accepts that only\nby reading a book is the book completed.\nThe reader brings to the work his own\npersonal lexicon: his own ways of\nunderstanding words, his own history,\nin short his own set of life experiences.\nHowever skillful the author, he is always\nwriting in a shared and confused\nlanguage and must always rely on his\nreader to interpret the work as best he\ncan. For this reason it has\nbeen proclaimed that the\nauthor is dead. More\nrealistically, the author is\nneatly de mystified. Hypertext is a paradigm for writing\nthat explicitly makes use of the human\npresence of the reader. Like the ancient\noral tradition, the reader is able to probe\nhis storyteller by the use of link words\n(currently selected using a mouse and\nembedded into the text as a different\ncolour or font). The author may write\nseparate threads of narrative to be used\nin different situations - rather like the\nFighting Fantasy novels of your childhood.\nThus, different people may read the\nsame book but reach different destinations. The computer, using hypertext,\nallows the author to escape the tyranny\nof chronological order and relate events\nor 'happenings' in a more digressive\nway, allowing the reader to move\nthrough the landscape of text in his own\nfashion. Only via this 'dynamic text' will\nwriting assume its next, post-post-modern incarnation.\nSilicon Semantics\nWhilst the French have been de constructing J the Q Semantics of language, the rest of\nthe world has been building computers.\nAnd whilst literary theory may justify the shift of power to\nthe Power-Hlac, the truth is that it would probably have\nhappened anyway. Survival of the fittest.\nComputers have been used as text engines for\ndecades already, in the shape of Word Processors. Word\nProcessors derive their power from their ability to keep text\n'alive' by translating it through various functions into hard\nstore. Whereas writing words on a page results in\nperm a nance that only replacement can overcome,\ncomputerised text is open like any other form of data to\nwell defined functions. The most obvious of these are spell\ncheckers and the mere ability to re-edit text. More powerful\nprograms, such as the QuarhExpress package I'm using\n| now, allow great control over the finished appearance of\nthe word! Finished - does it have to stop here?\nObviously not. Hypertext is a term first coined in the\n60's by \u00ae Ted lle lson. By retaining the words in the machine,\nhypertext is able to support cross reference linking to other\n'nodes' of text. i.e. It is reactive, it is dynamic. The\npossibilities open to authors are enormous and range from\nmultiple plots and multiple characters to whole new writing\nstyles. But the real authors of change are the computer\nprogrammers who bring hypertext bundled with the\nMacintosh and the html hypertext system which is helping\nto fuel the internet explosion.
