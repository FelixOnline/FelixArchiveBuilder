    "content": "ra JL i A EXPEDITION\nICELAND The small geological expedition to the east\nj f Iceland this summer was a complete success,\nand the four members returned from the eight\nto ten weeks' visit with the conviction that\nit had been an experience not to be missed.\nThe expedition car, an Austin A40 Countryman,\ncovered 4500 miles over roads that were at\ntimes extremely poor, and gave very little trouble. Now we have returned to Bngland and\nhave commenced examination of the 600 rock-specimens collected.\nThe first fortnight was devoted to a tour\nof the classic geological localities in S.W. and N. Iceland. We visited Hveradalir where\nthe natural steam is used to heat glasshouse s and grow tomatoes and bananas, and saw steam\nemerging from the ground where a telegraph\npoi e had been driven in. We tried to ascend\nthe famous volcano Hekla, but after trudging\nfor some hours over the incredibly rough surface of the 1947 lava were forced to abandon\nthe attempt. To our disappointment the volcano\ndid not erupt this year. We visited an ice-cap\nand a most impressive valley-glacier, and saw\nsome of the waterfalls for which Iceland is famous. We also saw a fascinating profusion of\nvolcanic feature* . and visited one area of hot\nsprings where dirty socks disintegrate an b sing washed in the hot water.\nThe rest of the time was spent making a geological map of part of the fiord country in the east of Iceland, and on the whole the rocks\ndid what was expected of them. The expedition\nmembers camped for practically the whole of the\nstay in Iceland, and various members took differing periods to become acc lim at is ed to a life in a small tent and a diet in which milk, macaroni and 'pom' occupied prominent places. One\nperson was unlucky enough to have his tent\ncollapse on him one cold, wet and stormy night,\nbut he has now recovered from the shock.\nG.P.L. W. NORWAY The expedition to Norway this Summer was\nhighly successful and enjoyed by all who took\npart. The two main objects of the expedition\nwere the investigation by the geologists and\nmeteorologists of the area round the Alfot\nglacier and the surveying o/ the Grondalen\nvalley but as no information has so far been\nobtained from expedition members about their\nscientific work, this report briefly describes\nsome of their other activities. Chief among these, probably, was eating.\nReaders may have imagined that explorers have\nto be content with dry biscuits washed down\nwith mugs of cold cocoa and an occasional hunk\nof reindeer meat, but this is not how I.C. organises its expeditions. We had a carefully planned diet about which a learned panel of\ndoctors had sat in consultation, and our every\nwant was catered for. Unfortunately the doctors do not allow for the large appetites of\nthe local cows, who once made away with a large\npart of our stores. Also, we were not provided\nwith any vitamin C it being assumed that large\nquantities of bil berries would be available at\nGrondalen, but in actual fact the season did not\nREPORTS\nCAM ARGUE The party made up of ten botanists and zoologists started out for the Rhdne delta on\nAugust 14th. and were away for a month. Their\ntransport consisted of two taxis, one of which\nhad been adapted as a small lorry, and both\nwere grossly overloaded. Although these two\nvehicles did not seem safe, most of the adventurers travelled quite comfortably. Exceptions\nwere the driver and co-driver of the small\nlorry who were subjected to continuous vi brat ion, nauseating fumes and noise caused by a faulty exhaust pipe.\nThe Great Camargue - the Rhone Delta - destination of the expedition, was found to be\nhot, sticky and populated by enormous mosquitos.\nThe combination of these factors, together with\nthe local wine (drunk because of the trouble\nthat had to be taken to sterilis e the drinking\nwater before use), unsettled all the travellers. They learnt quite a lot about living in adverse\nsurroundings and in carrying out ecological\nwork under difficult conditions.\nThe Great Camargue was later quitted for the\nPetit Camargue with its islands of umbrella\npines among dry salt lakes. Vegetation in the\ndelta area being controlled by salty conditions\nand thus being somewhat atypical, the expedition moved to Meome, north of Toulon, and spent\nthree days among pleasant Mediterranean oak\nand pine forest at about 800'. The birds studied in both areas were impressive, ranging from\nflamingos and egrets to hoopoe s, and some truly delightful specimens discovered in Stes. Maries.\nThe Journey cost each member less than 224\nfrancs a day in food (4/2d). Petrol cost each\nperson about \u00a32 for the round trip. The two\ntaxis which gave such sterling service are now,\nto the chagrin of the party, to be sold to the\nhighest bidder.\nIt is now the opinion of the team that in future expeditions of this nature fewer people, say\nabout six, would work better as a team. They r egret that they paid little attention to the cond it ion of their tyres before taking the two\ntaxis on to the Continent. They would have preferred faster and more robust transport even\nthough travelling around in old taxis dressed\nin Bohemian attire seems to be the \"done thing\"\nthese days i The members of the expedition wish us to record their thanks to all members of staff and the\ndepartment at Silwood for making the tripa success.\nstart until we had been there five weeks, an\nexample of the best laid plans going astray.\nThere was no outbreak of scurvy however, al though one of the symptoms, chronic somnolence,\nwas often in evidence.\nAn official film was shot of the expedition\nand it is rumoured that as a result of some of\nthe activities recorded in it, one member is already in serious trouble with his girlfriend. To prevent any further incidents of this nature\nthe film is now to be a closely guarded secret\nuntil it has been adequately censored\n\n"

    "content": "6 FELIX A FRESHMAN' S FIRST VIEW OF I.C.I had been told how to get to the Freshers\nReception but directions were quite unnecessary\nas the Union was admirably signposted1, by the\nfully-rigged sailing dinghy that stood outside the\nentr an oe, and the glider sitting on the sidewalk of\nImperial Institute Road.\nJust inside the building a number of bored looking\ngentlemen were sitting around in large arm o hairs reading\nsmall magazines and pointedly ignoring the stream of\nfresh faced young men passing through. Obviously post-grads waiting for the fresher s' free tea, I decided and\nhurried on up the 3t airs, though not before being coerced into buying a copy of Felix.\nOn first entering the reception the scene was\nquite amazing. At first the room seemed nothing but\na moving mass of people. Gradually it was. possible to\nmake out the various club stands round the walls and in\nthe o entre of the room, and my fellow freshmen eagerly\npushing their way from one stand to another. It was\nmore reminiscent of the January sales of Selfridges and\njust as easy to tell customers and salesmen apart by\ntheir dress, for whilst moat of us sweated in stiff\ncollars and best suits the various o lub organisers\nrelaxed in old jackets and flannels. Probably it reflected our respective attitudes to the occasion.\nUnfortunately^ the Boat and Rugger clubs had their\nstands just inside the door and people like myself (I am only 5' 5\") had the greatest difficulty in pushing\nour way past their large and beefy followers.\nOnce past this obstacle, however, it was little easier to make any progress and I found myself being\ncarried by the crowd first to this club stand, then\nthat, and on each occasion had various pamphlets and\ntyped sheets thrust into my unwilling hand and I was\nimplored ta sign an imposing looking form, being all the while assured that it didn't mean a thing. I'm sure no small boy ever collected train numbers more\navidly than some committee members were collecting\nsignatures that afternoon.\nThe photographic society were installed in a corner and advertising itself by an array of port-ra its, all of beautiful young girls it se. I joined on the spot. A little further on, a sartorial\nyoung man in a gay che ok waistcoat was enquiring of\neverybody whether they were conservative. I felt like\nexplaining that those of us living on University\ngrants had little chan oe of being anything else, but\ninstead I hurried past looking intently in the other\ndirection. Politics, I felt, was not quite the thing\nto get mixed up in at IrC. The Debating society were attracting a good deal\nof attention, main7 y due to some slick talking by one\nof their old hands, but I thought they might have; made\nbetter advertising use of their famous fresher's tea.\nThe Dramatic Society, on the other han* had been very\ningenious and made a model of their fn ture home in the\nnew Union with which to interest people. As I passed\nI overheard one of their numbers explaining that they\nhad two potential new members from Mines, apparently a an unheard of thing before. It made me wonder why\nminers should be less dramatic than the rest, of the\ncommunity at I.C. Probably something to do with the\nboots they had to wear I decided.\nBack once more at the door I considered that I had\nhad quite enough of the Fresher's Reception for one\nday. Once outside I found that I was just in time to\nqueue for the Fresher's Tea but prefer ed instead to pay\nfor and enjoy the relative peace and quiet of e&<( \u2022\n\u2022\nKensington cafe.\nBOYS CLUBS\nSeven members of the I.C. branch of the S.

    "content": "FELIX5 P.G' S A HIRE\nThe origin of the idea for this particular\nholiday is rather obscure, but was probably a> flash of inspiration occasioned by the brilliant\nweather in early May and the desire of two overworked goon-type mechanical P.G.\"a to cool off in quantities of water.\nFrantic; searching in boating magazines in the\nlibrary, followed by the expenditure of much cash in the Guild'3 'phone box - suitably punctuated with pauses\nfor fresh air and impatient demands of \".he\" intending\nusers - elicited the information that the . st, week in August was within then pst expensive season and +\nhr.t there appeared to be only one boat on the Thames\narai il able for hire. In the backwaters of Thames Iotton,\nand just about afloat, we found a \"cruiser' o ap able of\nacc somo dating only two at a time at night - and; then in\nseparate berths - that want by the doubtful name of\n\" 'Maid' Marjory\".\nThe original idea had included our respective\nfiancee s, the most recent of whom had been the subject\nof a lost bet and a round of sherry in the early hours\nof the ncr ning at the Engineer's Ball. But nothing ventured etc. and completely undaunted your scribes left a deposit on Marjory and departed, only to return on\nthe last Saturday evening in August - arriving between\nthe showers - complete with baggage, and one tent to\nfill the gap in the berthing arrangements.\n\"Strewth that ours ! ?\" was the general eminent.\nOld it looked and old it was, as her subsequent whims\nand fancies proved. At least, the paint was watertight,\nbut there was nothing we oo ul d do - especially when the\nroof let in the rain - except satisfy the furious demands of an inefficient bilge-pump. Old though Marjory\nwas she was capable of in a in tain inga steady 6 amps -5 knots by rough calibration - or even eight when\npushed, sufficient, with the aid of wind and patient\nlock-keepers, to swamp the stunts in the punts and\nkeep up with far more modern, larger and powerful\ncraft.\nSo it was that with L plates all but\nflapping in the breeze, we set out from Thames\nDitton, feeling our way in the fast approaching darkness, described a figure-of-eight and\n3pent the night in complete respectability\nbeneath the walls of Hampton Court.\nThe next morning, of course, pro duo ed our first\nbig teat. With heart in mouth, hands on throttle and\nclutch, instruction manuals spread before, the crew\nat the ready with ropes, fenders, boat-hook and mop,\nMaid Marjory successfully negotiated Hampton Lockmore by instinct on her part than skill on ours 1\nAnd 30 all went well for the whole of one week\nin quite fair weather. Of course, there were the odd\nscrapes, as the concrete embankment at Sconing - now\nsporting some curious streaks of green paint - and\nthe fender wrenched bodily from the gunwale \u2014 screws\nand all at Henley, will testify. Then there was\nthe boat-hook left at Shepperton on the way back\nwhilst hurried attention was paid to the rules relating to toilet disposal.\nThe scenery along the Thames is really worth\nseeing and it gets prettier the further you go. It is;\ntypical pastoral England at its best, and is full of endless interest and variety. For those who are\ninterested, tn ere are pubs galore and many have a quaint, olde-world e, unspoilt charm of their own.\nEspecially do we recommend 'The Swan' at Streatley\n- 10 varieties of Harveys' Sherries J Plenty to do ? Yes, especially with the boat\nto attend to in many ways and the needs of the crew,\nand locks every few miles. From first-hand experience we can provide you with a guide entitled\n'Gents we have known along the Thames.' But beware\nthe agony when you arrive at the fortunately very\nrare look where there are no facilities. We did hear\nthat there is one good one for the ladies at Caversham Bridge, but apart from that - it's very much\na case of 'wait and see'.\nFor those contemplating a cheap holiday in new,\nexciting, amusing and interesting novel circumstances\n- try a boat on the Thames, It oost four of us \u00a38.10a. each - all in. And for the fun you get out of it, it's cheap at twice the price.\nP.R. R.& J.A.K. WLSIIVS (Mlll.V PRESS FREEDOM The strict editorial supervision\nof FELIX was usurped by none other than the I.C.

Not only\nis the new building not ready, but many of temporary facilities available last year have gone.\nSeveral clubs have had to accept emergency measures and have done so with admirable tolerance.\nAdded to the temporary arrangements listed in the last Felix is a Committee Room on the Fourth\nFloor (Sast side) of the New Hostel. This can be\nreached by entering the Staff Billiards Room\nand going through the door on the left. The\nStaff Billiards Room is available to students\nafter5 p.m. bookings can be made in the\nbook by the Hostel letter-rack.\nProgress in the rest of the new building is not electrifying. In fact, it is pathetic. The\nnext noteworthy advance will be on Tuesday,\nNovember 6th. when the Dining Hall, Senior\nCommon Room, Reading Room and I. C.W. A. Lounge\nwill be opened. Unfortunately the list of\nrooms to which top priority should be given,\ndrawn up by Union officers last July, seems to\nhave been ignored. A request was. then made\nthat, in the event of an emergency, efforts\nshould be concentrated on the ground floor and\nthe dining-hall. With refectories, lounge,\nbar, notice-boards and cloakrooms at least the\nUnion Centre would have been back in Its rightful abode, without the need for a great upheaval in the middle of the year. The three rooms\non the Bast side of the 1st. floor which are\nto be opened on Nov. 6th. are non-essentials,\nand workmen will be above and below them for\ntwo or three reeks.\nThe remainder of the building ( it is all eg ed) will be finished by the end of November,\nIncluding the Gymnasium and Upper Refectory.\nAlthough rea&on p. ble progress is apparent in the Concert Hall (which may even be in a sufficiently advanced stage to be used for the\nUnion meeting on Oct. 23rd.) and the lounge,\nthe top floor (Bast side) and Bar have jolted\nto a complete standstill. Apparently it is impossible to engage enough workmen to finish off all the rooms simultaneously. The top\nfloor was so nearly finished last July that it seems incredible that it is still' in the same\nstate now. The table tennis and billiards rooms\nwould have been particularly welcome.\nDuring these months of agonising ly slow\nprogress the unenviable task of being the di rect negotiator with the contractors has fallen on Dr. Sparkes and Mr. Briggs of the Planning\nearn* chosen\nffe congratulate those who have been selected to go to the Karakoram.

This was despite a series\nof setbacks which would have surely de moral is eda lesser man.\nMr. Mooney is one of those comparative\nrarities among administrators who realise that\nstudents are the one essential ingredient of\na college and that their needs and welfare\nmust come before all else. He accordingly set\nabout his colossal task with his characteristic\nrefusal to be flustered.\nMr. Mooney had been informed that the\nkitchens said Refectory would be available for\nhim to move in on Thursday, October 4th., thus\n.giving him reasonable time to prepare for the\nfollowing Monday.

A senior member of the\nI.C. Administration informed the President\nthat he could not see how the Refectory could\npossibly be used until Friday, 12th. However,\n\"cometh the hour, cometh the man.''\nBut even worse was to come. On Sunday morning the kitchens and the serving hatch were\nstill swarming with workmen. Mr. Mooney could\nnot start until4.50 p.m. The \"working squad\"\nwho were to carry the heavy packages of equipment from their storing place in the Snack Bar\nacross to the Refectory packed up their bags\nand went home. Not until about 6 p.m. could\nMr. Mooney and his kitchen staff begin their\nmove, and they were assisted by eight volunteers from the Hostel.\nProfile of the Union ex cut l ve IG AND THEM it\nOn Monday morning the kitchen was a scene\nof chaos. Remnants of painters and tile rs were\nfinishing off their work. The only sign of food\nwas a huge bowl of steaming soup being vigorous-ly stirred by \" Kit\", who has been a cook at I.C. for thirty years and who knew of worse times\nthan this during the war. She shouted cheerfully\n\"Don't worry dear, the lads'11 have their lunch\nat 12.\" Meanwhile dusty plates had been stacked\ninto the new washing machine. The switch was\npressed, the brushes revolved - but unfortunately in the wrong direction, and their effect\nwas not to clean the plates but to fling a spray of water all over the kitchen. Elsewhere\nMr. Mooney was peering into a large pan of fat. Dense black smoke rose into his face and more\nfat was flung in to avert a conflagration. With\nthe kitchen awash in one comer and threatening\nto become aflame in another, Mooney and Co.battled on, and so over four hundred people obtained their lunch little realising the drama that\nhad gone before. It is as well to retain a sense\nof humour In such troublesome times as this !\nThe Union will make some official recognition of this tremendous effort by the kitchen\nand counter staff, and by Mr. Mooney himself,\nin due course.

All18 fresher s spoke thus\nproving it wasn't just the tea that attracted\nthem.\nThe standard shown augurs well for debating\nat I.C. this year, for although the motions\nwere difficult and the time short, most of the\nspeakers combined substance and gloss fairly neatly and definite style could be seen in many\nof them. Debating had a good season at I.C. last year, there seems to be no reason why this\nyear shouldn't be even better.\nThe Eighth Imperial College\nCOMMEMORATION BALL Thursday, 25th October, 1956\nCLARIDGB'S HOTEL\nDancing from 8.30 p.m. until2.30 a.m. to the\n|music of THE BILL SAVILL ORCHESTRA\n2ign s. in cl. buffet - Evening Dress\n|0r der before the 19th October to make sure\nof a ticket.\n\n"

    "content": "8 FELIX SWIMMING CLUBS\nSUCCESSFUL TOUR IN DEVON\nOn Tuesday 26th. June, eleven members of the\nSwimming Club departed from I.C. hostel in very sunny\nweather, excellent spirits and ancient cars, to test\nthe beer and water of the South Vfest.\nFive water polo matches were played, of which three\nwere won, one drawn and one lost. The first game at\nn'e yai out h took place in tii e coldest water the team has\never been subjected to, ruin being necessary to revive\nthe team. This latter item wa3 responsible for our\nfinal victory of 5 goals to 4. In swimming the\ncollege was too strong for the opposition winning\nthe one match easily and all the invitation relays\nat the other matches.\nThe next day the waters were warmer at Minehead and\nthe team had little trouble in winning by 6-0 before\nan audience of at least 600.\nAt Barnstaple Clarke and ii c Chesney won an exciting\nrace in the freestyle, Robinson broke the bath record\nin winning the breast stroke and with Clarke and\nDavidson showing a clean pair of feet to the opponents\nin the back stroke, the swimming was one easily 20-10\npoints. Barnstaple had their revenge 7-1 in the polo\nand although the college deserved to lose, some very\ncurious local rules invoked by the man with the whist\nspoilt what could have been a good game.\nOur opponents at Bxmouth were all county players,\nI.C. having but two with such experience, R. King (UC)\nwho guested for us on this occasion and our skipper\nM. Clarke. A very fast and exciting game followed ,\nwith the college leading by the odd goal for most of\nthe match. Exmouth were not to be denied however\nand equalise d in the last seconds of the game with a final score 4-4.\nThe tour was completed in typical I.C. fashion\nir. the local hosteler ies. SQUASH CLUB\nThis year we are again fortunate ir. that four of last\nyears 1st. to am are still with us. John Hart, John\nBraithwaite, David Stevens and Brian Hill. John Hart\nour secretary has been elected University Captain\nand we wish him well in this post Trials have been\nheld and most of the players were of good average\nstandard and it is probable that we shall be able to\nfield one of our strongest second teams ever. The\nla-d der system is now in operation and all players\nare encouraged to play ladder matches as this helps\nin team selection.\nGOOD ATTENDANCE\nAT HOCKEY TRIALS\nI.C. hockey club trials took place last week and\nwere well attended. Over 40 players came on each day,\nand although there was no one outstanding, the general\nstandard bodes well for the future. In the past the\ndifference in the standard of hockey between the 1st. and the other elevens has been considerable, but now\nthe club looks to the fresher s to improve the record of\nthe 2nd. and 3rd. elevens.\nAll 3 elevens go into action on 20th. Oct. against\nOld Dunstablians.\nForthcoming fixtures of 1st. XI are;-Sat. 27 Oet. Ashford.\nWed. 31 Oct. University College.\nII. C. Ai\u00a3l hille iE@$ in Norway\nOur ten day tour of Norway commenced on July 1st. The party r which included one lady (sport) flew from\nSouthend by chartered Dakota to Fornebo airport outside Oslo. We were met there by a young lady (more\nsport) who conducted us to the city centre.\nThe team spent three days becoming acc lim at is ed in Oslo, staying at a Youth Hostel, before moving\nsouth to Fredrikstord where our first match took place\non a rain sodden track.\nHighlights of this match, which as a spectacle wa3 ruined with the incessant downpour, were Bill Pain's and John Conway's struggle in the 3000m against the\narea champion Lars Comeliussen. Pain covered in mud\nheld off numerous chal langes before galloping home to\na30 yard win. Henry Pinsent ran gallantly in 400m hurdles to finish 2nd to Jan Borgersen who is the\nNorwegen record holder. The 800m was won by Le3 Locke\nwho allowed the four Norwegians to set the pace before\nstriding past in the last 150m. The 400m was quite\nfarc i al as Pinsent and Locke disappeared in ac lou a oi spray and mud on the last bend when leading.\nOur field events men, Phil Teyribee and David\nLangden, found the conditions exceptionally trying,\nand as a result their performances were below what\nwas expected. Tony Watts made a welcome return as our\nguest on the tour to partner John Hobson in the 100m where they finished 2nd. and 3rd. At this stage the\nmatch was abandoned with the promise that we would\nreturn to complete the relay programme on the following\nMonday. This promise was kept and we won both relays\nin the evening of that day.\nOur next match took place at Holden on the Swedish\nborder. By this time the weather had changed fortuna t ly for the better. The match was almost similar in content\nto the previous one except that with the improved form\nof David Langden and Phil Toynbee we managed to reverse\nthe result. Here again John Hobaon and Tony Watts\ntook 2nd and 3rd in the 100m. Richard Hicks came 3rd. in the 400m won by Henry Pinsent in a very close\nstruggle. Les Locke again won the 800m to set a new\nI.C. record, whilst Bill Pain arid John Conway eclipsed\ntheir opponents in the 3000m to establish a new record.\nThe last event, the 1000m relay was won by I.C. in a very fast time. This was a new event which should\nbe run here more often as it tests both speed and tact-ics.\nThe rest oi our stay was spent in drinking, dancing\nand sport making. It was a most enjoyable holiday\nin a beautiful country and plans are now in hand to\ninvite both Fredrikstord I.F. and Holden I.F. over\nnext summer.\n\n"

This heartfelt plea is issued jointly by the Sports Ed. and a\" friend of his.\nTwelve members of I.C. met in Saas Fee in Switzerland this summer for the Karakoram Expedition Training\nMeet. The main object was to get experience in high 1\nlevel camping on glaciers and snow fields and to get\nto know the other members of the team. For the first week one party of six did a high level traverse from\nSaas Fee to Zermatt via the Alphubeljock, Allalinpass\nand Adlerpass, several camps being only just short of\nthe 4000 meter mark. Peaks climbed included the\nAll al in hom, Alphubel, Strahlhorn, Adlerhorn and Himpfischorn. The other party climbed from the Mischibel\nHut on the Dom Leinspitze ridge but were severely\nhampered by deep snow.\nAt Zermatt we exchanged equipment and the camping\nparty set off in the Monte Rosa area. They traversed\nunder lion te Rosa, along the frou n tier ridge and down to\nthe Fluhalp and Zermatt, climbing on the way Castor,\nthe traverse of Monte Rosa, Gimma de Jazzi, Strahlhorn\nand the Rimpfischhorn. The other party climbing from\nhuts did a partial traverse of the Briethorn (not\ncompleted because of bad snow), Castor, Dom, and the\nfirst ascent of the Taschhorn that 3e as on. For the third week we interchanged parties and all climbed from huts. Peaks climbed included the Zinal\nRothorn, Obergablehorn, Matterhom and an unsuccessful\nattempt was made on the Weisshorn. At the end of the\nweek we met in Brig railway station, all very happy,\ndirty and well sunburnt after a most successful alpine\nseason.\nRUGGER CLUB'S TRIALS\nThe club having lost many members of last years\nsuccessful 1st. XV, finds itself in a position where\nrapid team building is necessary. A record intake\nof fresher s many of whom show great promise together\nwith those remaining from last year should however\nensure another good season for all the teams. Club\nofficials watched 60 fresher s playing in the 3ix trial teams which turned up at Harlington on Saturday,\nbut due to the enormity of the task it will be some\nweeks be lore the merits of the respective players\nget sorted out.\nOur first match was on Sunday 14th October against\nthe London Springboks. This team i3 well known to\nprevious members of I.C. teams, as much for the feverish\nactivity in the bar after the match as for the high\nstandard of the opponents.\nCROSS COUNTRY CLUB\nThe Cross Country Club trials are to be held next\nWednesday and Saterday at Petersham and thus it is\ndifficult at present ot assess our potentialities for\nthe coming season. If however U.G' s relay race on\nSaturday is any guide we should have a very strong\nteam.\nThe U.C. relay,6x1*7 miles, had a large entry\nincluding most of the London teams as well as those\nfrom Provincial Universities. Loughborough soon\ntook the lead and held it throughout the race. Behind\nthem a fierce battle developed between I.C.,U. C. and Kings. Bonnet a fresher ran for the I.C. second\nteam and put up a particularly fast time wh i oh looks\nwell for the future. I. C.1st. team finally came in\n4th behind Loughborough, U.C. and Kings.\nAt the time of going to press there is an air of uncertainty surrounding the Boat Club.\n\n"
