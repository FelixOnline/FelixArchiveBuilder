    "content": "Two pints of\nlager and a packet of crisps...\n\"Food, glorious\nfood.\" How many of\nyou can't sym pathis e with this sentiment?\nBut a look at our\ndiets reveals them to\nbe anything but\nglorious. Among the\nmaze of 'discoveries'\nand theories about\nwhat we should be\neating, a few facts\nstand out as (almost)\ncertain. Most of\nus\u2014that is, in the\nwestern society\u2014are\neating too much fat,\ntoo little fibre, and\ntoo many calories.\nOther, more doubtful\nsuggestions\u2014that\nmost diets contain\ntoo much salt, too\nfew vitamins, too\nmuch meat...\nUnfortunately, the right answers are\nsimply not all known: experts and\ncommentators are still at the stage of\ninterpreting\u2014each in their own way,\nof course\u2014interim results from newly\nstarted research.\nEating patterns have changed over\nthe years.- Rather than three 'proper'\nmeals a day, people eat when they feel\nlike it, often far more than three times\na day. As many snack foods are very\nhigh in fat, sugar and salt, but poor\nin vitamins, this may be a reason why\nheart disease kills 180,000 people a year in Britain; or why by middle age\n50% of men and 33 % of women are\ntoo fat. More bad news; some forms\nof cancer are becoming more\ncommon. This may be diet related;\nbut diet must also play some part in\nthe fact that more people than ever\nbefore are living to the age of 80 and\nover.\nSo don't panic and start one of the\nmany fad diets. Each of the vital\ningredients in any diet can do harm\nwhether eaten to excess or in too\nsmall quantities. There's nothing\nwrong with individual foods, either;\ntheir effect will depend on how you\ncombine them to form your total diet.\nAnd the big question is: how do you\neat healthily on a student-sized bank\naccount?\n'Fibre' seems to be the word of the\nmoment. Found only in plants, it is\ncredited with reducing risks of\ndivert i cul it is and colon cancer;\npossibly of heart disease; hiatus\nhernia and constipation. But watch\nit\u2014too much reduces absorption of\nsome nutrients and may cause\ndiarrhoea. Your average intake\nshould be about 30g per day (see table\nfor nutritional value of several\ncommon foods). If you think your diet\nlacks fibre, increase the amount\nslowly\u2014over 2 to 3 weeks. Bran in\nbreakfast foods (read the packet), and\nwhole meal bread are good sources.\nFruit and vegetables also help, these\ncan generally be bought cheaply,\nespecially in the markets. Brown\npasta and brown flour in cooking may\nalso be useful.\nFat, of course, is the main villain\nin our diets. It is an important\nsubstance as the main energy source\nand a component of every cell in the\nbody, besides helping in the\nabsorption of important fat-soluble\nvitamins (eg vitamins A, D,E and K). But it is beneficial only in the right\nquantities. One can suffer ill effects\nfrom too little fat, but you'd have to\ntry very hard to achieve this. No one\nover the age of five should get more\nthan 35% of their energy from fat; for\nwomen this usually means 60 to 85g per day, for men 70 to 1 lOg per day,\ndepending on energy intake. Basic\nsteps to reduce your fat intake start\nwith eliminating as much 'visible fat'\nas possible\u2014no meat fat, no chicken\nskin, less butter or margarine. Then\ngo on to cut down on 'invisible fat'.\nThis means grilling (or other fat less cooking techniques) instead of frying\nfood. Switching to semi-skimmed or\nskimmed milk will help still more.\nCholesterol is a problem associated\nwith fat in a diet, so keep an eye on\nwhat type of fats you're eating-animal fats have generally high\ncholesterol values, egg yolks are\nparticularly notorious. (Cholesterol,\nas everyone knows, can build up in\nthe arteries, leading to heart disease.)\nCarbohydrates are mainly\nrepresented in food by sugars and\nstarch, both of which, like fat, are\nconverted to body fat if eaten in\nexcess. Unless you have a weight\nproblem (too much or too little)\nyou're probably getting enough. Note\nthat some people divide this class of\nfood into 'valuable' and 'empty'\ncarbohydrates. The former deliver,\nbesides the carbohydrate, some\nvitamins, minerals or fibre, and\ninclude such foods as whole grain\nproducts, fresh and dried fruits,\npotatoes and other vegetables. The\n'empty' carbohydrates comprise,\nnaturally, many of the snack foods\u2014\nchocolates, sweets, jams and other\nconfections including white bread.\nProtein\u2014vital for the growth of\ncells and muscles\u2014is another material\nof which an excess is converted into\nbody fat. Most people are probably\ngetting plenty. Vegetarians, if they\ninclude milk and cheese in their diet,\nprobably also get enough protein.\nVegans, on the other hand, have to\ntake special care. Important to their\ndiet are pulses (beans, lentils), grains,\nnuts and potatoes. Meat eaters, for\nvarious reasons, are advised to\nconsume more fish and less red meat.\nSalt, vitamins and minerals are also\nan important part of the diet. A total\nlack, or more likely, low levels of any\none of a dozen vitamins or minerals\ncan lead to constant tiredness and lack\nof enthusiasm for life, at the least.\nMore severe shortages cause such\ndeficiency diseases as scurvy or\ngoitre. But any moderately sensible\ndiet is likely to contain a reasonable\namount of each vitamin so if you feel\nunder-dosed don't head for the\nvitamin tablets; readjust your diet.\nTake the 'recommended daily\nallowances' (RDAs) with a pinch of\nsalt (not literally, please...high salt\nintake helps raise blood-pressure).\nNine years ago they were set too high,\nto ensure that no-one suffered\ndeficiency diseases,and if you know\nwhether they've been lowered since,\nyou should be writing this article.\nSpeaking of recommended\nallowances, the average energy intake\nrecommended by the DHSS has been\nfound to be too high as people are\nnow less active in general than was\nthought when the figures were set.\nWomen need about 1750 kcal; men\nabout 2000 kcal per day. It is possible\nto keep to a balanced diet within these\nlimits whatever your eating patterns,\nthough it is harder when you're eating\nlots of small snacks. Just remember\nthat your diet stands the best chance\nof being healthy if you eat a variety\nof foods, ranging from bread, rice and\npasta (preferably whole meal/ whole\ngrain), oatmeal and high fibre\nbreakfast cereals, and pulses, to lean\nmeat, (skinless) poultry, fish, eggs,\nlots of different vegetables including\npotatoes, fruit, and skimmed milk.\nFor more extensive, expert, and\npossibly controversial, advice on\nhealthy eating, consult any of the\nnumerous diet books. McDonalds\n(remember hamburgers?) even\nproduce their own 'Nutrition Guide'.\nVery sensible stuff, but watch the way\nthey carefully avoid the word 'fibre'.\nBon ap petit..........; vegetables, nuts and cereals.\nAlthough the amount different\nI people need vat tes a great deal,\nmany medical authorities betto ve that the national average intake of\n20g3 day should be increased to\nabout 30g.

    "content": "Union W vW Wt *S Hello everyone, welcome or welcome\nback to IC. I am not going to write\nanything about IC and the first weeks\nhere, as the fresher s among you will\nhave handbooks and the rest of you\nwill know it all anyhow. I'd just like\nto remind you about the tiddlywinks\ndown Oxford Street on Saturday,\nwhere we all have our first chance of\nthe year to raise money for charity.\nAt the same time don't forget\nFreshers' Fair on Tuesday, cos\ngetting involved in clubs after that\npoint can be quite hard, but don't let\nthat deter you.\nNow we've got the drivel out of the\nway, here's a quick update on the\nsummer.\nResidences\nWhen you left last year, ICU had\ndecided not to recognise the Student\nResidence Committee (SRC) as a valid decision-making body. Well,\nover the summer, the S RC had\ndecided to and is in the process of\nreassessing its terms of reference, the\nstructure of the committee and the\nmanagement structure in the\nresidences. It would appear at present\nthat the Union will do well out of the\nreorganisation although these are\nearly days yet.\nAt the end of the year it was\nreported that College rents will rise\nby \u00a37 per week over the next three\nyears. This is a direct result of\nCollege purchasing an extra 200\nplaces. It is interesting to note that the\nrevised College plan indicates that\nthere will be an increase in student\nplaces with College-owned\naccommodation of 250 places per\nyear for the next four years, yet there\nis no indication of where the money\nis going to come from to pay for this.\nSurely they cannot expect it come out\nof rents? Still on accommodation, the\nUnion has held the first meeting of the\nUnion Accommodation Committee in\n12 years which strangely had no\nmatters arising from the previous\nminutes. We will be looking for one\nstudent representative from each hall\nor house to sit on this committee and\nlook at the general problems of\nhousing as well as independent\nproblems in Imperial accommodation.\nSo if you live in IC accommodation\nand are keen to look after the wellbeing of your friends as well as\ngetting involved in hall or house\nactivities speak to your warden or\nsub warden as soon as possible.\nIntercollegiate Halls\nSome quite interesting information\nabout intercollegiate halls has come\nto light over the summer, but we will\ndiscuss this at the U GM, so you'd better be there.\nThe Junior Common Room\nThe J CR problem has not yet been\nresolved but rumour has it that we are\nlikely to be given a new J CR somewhere else in College, probably\nin the basement of Mines. Having\nbeen down and looked around this\nbasement I could not see any suitable\narea. Perhaps I just have a very poor\nimagination?\nDamages\nHaving talked about residences and\nthe JCR, I would like to point out that\nthe College has spent quite a lot of\nmoney and effort on bringing these\nareas up to standard with a few\nexceptions in residences. Last year\nLinstead Hall was brought up to\nscratch and it was so badly treated that\nit had to be repainted this year. Within\na week of the J CR refurbishment\nsomeone was found stubbing a cigarette out on the wall to see if it\nmelted. These areas are put there for\nyour good, treat them well and if you\nsee anyone abusing them tell them not\nto, after all it will come out of your\npockets in the end either as increased\nrents or increased food prices.\nCollege is not rich, in fact it is very\npoor and they cannot afford to pay for\nthese things every year. As far as halls\nare concerned, I will be pushing\ncommunal area damage and that\nmeans repainting, to be costed at the\nend of the year and taken out of\neveryones' deposits. I'm sorry about\nthose of you who treat the place well,\nbut if it doesn't come out of your\npockets it will only have to come from\nyour successor's and they are\ndefinitely innocent.\nPublic Relations\nCollege has made one of the most\npositive and forward- looking moves\nin years by appointing a public\nrelations officer (Ian Moore). At the\nlast College Finance and Executive\nCommittees his budget for the next 5\nyears was approved. This included an\ninput of \u00a3169,000 next year, this is\nexpected to be recovered by 1989\nwith a net profit of over \u00a3320,000 by\n1990. In this I wish Ian Moore the\ngreatest success.\nLast Point\nAs a last point I'd like to say farewell\nto Stagefright who are turning\nprofessional and leaving IC. I wish\nthem all the best with this and must\nsay they show more promise than any\nband I 've seen before. At the same\ntime I would like to thank Jason, Nass\nand especially Peter for running the\nSnack Bar so well over the summer\nas they are leaving us.\nYours, Ian\nPS. Remember to enjoy the\nentertainments lined up for the\ncoming week.\nHowgate's hangover\nWomen only\nDuring Freshers' Week most events\ngo on until the early hours of the\nmorning which leaves many women\nstudents with the choice of whether\nto miss the parties or to brave London\nat night.\nWith the high rents around\nKensington, many students are forced\nto live out in Wandsworth, Putney or\nNorth London. It is a sad fact that\nmany women have very little choice\nwhen faced with problems such as no\ntransport or the likelihood of getting\nstuck late at night alone. Most women\nknow better than to walk London's streets alone at night unless absolutely\nnecessary.\nThis may all seem a little dramatic,\nespecially if you come from a quiet\nneighbourhood, but attacks are\nreported daily so there is certainly\nsomething for women to be scared\nabout.\nThe police advise young women not\nto wear expensive jewellery or\nfashionable clothes because that\nwould just be asking for trouble so\ndon't be surprised if there are a large\nnumber of nuns at the Freshers'\nevents!\nLuckily the Union have decided to\nprovide a minibus service after the\nNew Year's Party and Freshers' Ball\nto take women students home, this\nwill come as a great relief to those\nwho would have stayed at home\notherwise.\nThe minibuses will be leaving from\nBeit Arch from 2.00am on Tuesday\nand Saturday mornings to coincide\nwith the shutting of the Union Bar.\nThis service is for women students\nonly.\nSomething\nfor nothing\nStudents are eligible to claim for free\nprescriptions on the grounds of low\nincome. You apply by filling in form\nPI 1, available from the Post Office,\nDHSS or chemist.\nRefunds\nTo get a refund you must retain your\nreceipt from the chemist and send it to\nthe DHSS with a letter explaining your\ncircumstances.\nDental Treatment & Glasses\nIf you have a certificate of exemption\nentitling you to free prescriptions then\nyou automatically qualify for free dental\ntreatment and NHS glasses. You must\nfill out a claim from (FID at the dentists\nor Fl at the opticians) and send it to your\nlocal DHSS Office.\nOverseas Students\nOverseas students are eligible to claim\nfor these health benefits if they are\nenrolled on a full-time course.\nSPORTS FACILITIES\nBOOKINGS\nWould all clubs and societies who\nwish to use gym facilities this\nterm please collect a Gym\nBooking Form from the Union\nOffice and return it at the latest\nby 14th October. Gym bookings\nwill then be notified to those\nconcerned on Monday 19th October. Gyms include volleyball\ncourt. Union Gym, Weights Room,\nSouthside Gym, Tennis/Netball\nCourts.\nRob Gee, ACC Chairman\n10 Monday October 5th1987 FELIX\n\n"

I hope you'll like the brand new format\nand enjoy reading all the features\nwe've lined up for you this year.\nNight of the Long Knives\nIt looks as though the Student\nAccommodation Office is going\nthrough another metamorphosis.\nCollege administration finally realised\nthat the Accommodation Office was\nstill unable to cope with all that it had\nbeen expected to. I fail to understand\nthe reasoning behind sending caring\nex-Student Accommodation Officer\nLesley Gillingham over to College's Finance Section and allowing Michael\nArthur, who never seemed to give a damn about students when he ran the\noffice before, take charge for the\nbusiest period of the year.\nRector\nAn invitation was extended to the\nRector to write an official welcome\nto, or back to, College in FELIX. He\nfelt that this was not necessary and\ndeclined the offer. This puzzles me,\nas the Rector is continually\ncomplaining about his lack of contact\nwith the rest of College and how he\nwishes he could bridge the gap. Over\n4,000 students and staff read FELIX each week. Surely FELIX is the ideal\nway to close that ever-widening gap.\nHamlet Gardens\nLast week I joined IC Chief Engineer\nDavid Evans, Brian Lloyd Davies and\nICU President Ian Howgate for a trip\nto Hamlet Gardens. The purpose of\nthe visit was to show senior College\nofficials the state of some flats which\nFresher students would be moving\ninto this week. What confronted us\nwas rising damp, mouldy old mattresses, dead mice, broken\nfurniture and curtain less rooms. The\nvisit obviously did the trick, because\nboth officials were suitably disgusted\nand promised as much money and\nmanpower as was needed to repair the\nFresher flats. The flats which second\nand third year students are to rent\nhave been given a lower priority as\nthese students apparently 'know what\nto expect'.\nThe question which begs to be\nanswered is, why must the Union\ndraw such things to the attention of\ntop College officials? Why was the\nStudent Accommodation Office\nprepared to leave the flats in such a state? News\u2014or the lack of it\nIt has become harder and harder to\nremain the newspaper of Imperial\nCollege Union. With so few people\nwilling to talk to us, it's not surprising\nthat the FELIX staff find it more\nrewarding to write features rather\nthan news. This edition has been\nincredibly frustrating. The main story\nshould have been based on the\nCollege Finance & Executive (one of\nthe highest committees) held a few\nweeks ago which discussed such\ntouchy subjects as departmental\nautonomy and the fate of the money\nraised from the sale of Harlington\ngravel. FELIX was not allowed to\nobserve at this meeting as all College\ncommittees are closed. For some\nreason, the Union Executive have\ndecided that they are not going to tell\nFELL X what went on in this meeting.\nIt seems that they have told every\nother Union officer the tale but on the\nunderstanding that the information is\nkept secret. Every person I have\nmentioned Harlington gravel to has\nshied away, muttering that they swore\nthey wouldn't tell! It's the first time\nthat I have encountered anything like\nthis from the Union Executive. Every\nUnion member has a right to know\nwhat any Union officer is doing on\nour behalf. I hope to be raising this\nquestion at Thursday's Union General\nMeeting. Watch this space for more\ninformation as the saga unfolds!\nTouch not the Cat\nFELL X has a motto which has always\nbe\u00abn held dear by its staff: Keep the\nCat Free. We put great importance on\nour editorial freedom. Our place is to\ncriticise if criticism is due\u2014whether\nit be College administration or Union.\nI heard today that our Union President\nbelieves that he alone should have the\nright to censor FELIX. He has said\nopenly that he thinks that Union\nOfficers are there to do the work and\nit is his place to make decisions. If\nMr Howgate were to put his ego away\nfor one moment, he would realise that\nit is not he that is The Union but every\nstudent that is The Union. He is\nmerely a representative. We are the\nones who make the decisions. I hope\nthat you will all attend the Union\nGeneral Meeting on Thursday and use\nyour vote to vote for editorial\nfreedom.\nK8F\nEditor-in-Chief Judith Hackney\nBusiness Manager Chris Martin\nNews Editors Kamala Sen and Pippa Salmon\nReviews Editor Ashley Niblock\nScience Editor Steve Black\nClubs Editor Kamala Sen\nTypesetting Rose Atkins\nPrinting Shane and David\nContributors: Bill Goodwin, David Williams, Chas Brereton, Chris\nMartin, David Jones, Adrian Bourne, Kamala Sen, Pippa Salmon,\nChris Jones, Rose Atkins, Ian Howgate, Chas Jackson, Andy\nBannister, Linda Simmons, John Noble, Alan Rose, Liz Holford,\nNigel Whitfield, Kathy Tait, Steve Kilmurray and Jane Spiegel.\nPrint Unit\nDue to unfortunate circumstances, the Print Unit will not be\nable to print private work until the middle of November\nAll publicity required for clubs should be booked in well in\nadvance\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW72 BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "Union Cards\nDue to the rather par lou s state of\nresidence security in College, it has\nbeen decided to revise completely\nsecurity arrangements in the Halls of\nResidence, particularly Southside\nHalls. The upshot of this is that\nwhereas previously the Union Card\nhas been just one colour, this year\nanyone in College residence will have\nthe privilege of a two colour Union\nCard, on one side the Union colour\nand the opposite face being the\nresidence colour.\nIn order to get your new style all-singing, all-dancing Union Card, you\nwill need to collect a slip attesting to\nyour residence at the same time as\ncollecting your keys. You then bring\nthis along with your registration slip\nin order to obtain your card.\nThis year is just a trial run for the\nnew style card, but College Security\nwill be testing the new security\narrangements for one week in November.\nInsurance\nI require an inventory for insurance\npurposes from every club or society.\nThe forms are in your pigeonholes,\nso please collect them as this is a very\nimportant matter. Remember, if you\ndon't it'll end in tears.\nTransport\nThe new van has now arrived,\nhopefully by the time of printing,\nTransport Committee will have\napproved some minor changes to the\noperation of the van fleet, so watch\nout for any changes which will be\npublicised fully.\nParking Permits\nThe application forms can be\ncollected from the Union Office and\nmust be returned by 5.30pm, this\ncoming Friday (9th October). The list\nof allocations will be printed in F ELK, and any applicant not granted\none can fill in an appeal form to fight\nover a few permits kept behind for\nthat very purpose.\nLate Night Drinking\nI have negotiated a deal with the\nowners of 3rd Street (once the\nCromwellian), which is opposite the\nNatural History Museum. We get free\nentrance to the club (open till 3am) on 3 nights a week, plus reduced\nentrance on the other nights. Also on\nWednesdays, the booze will be kept\nat pub prices, between 11pm and\n3am.

    "content": "*S* \u00a3Mftg\nF\" EEl _ 1\nas the DDR gradually increased the\nwall's defences, escape became more\ncomplex and more expensive.\nThere were always those in the\nWestern city who were prepared to\nhelp those trapped in the East, often\nat great personal risk to themselves.\nMany of these were students incensed\nby the inhumanity of the wall. They\nwere helped financially by right wing\npolitical parties, anti-communist\ngroups and the press who were always\nhungry for a good escape story.\nInevitably there were those who\nentered into the escape business for\ntheir own profit and during the 1960's a large number of 'escape firms' grew\nup. Not all of the firms were reliable.\nOften customers in the East would\npay extortionate amounts of money\nfor a half baked escape scheme which\ninvariably resulted in imprisonment\nfor the unfortunate defectors. It\nbecame commonplace for rival firms\nto betray each other to the East\nGerman authorities; premises were\nburgled, forged papers stolen, and\nlists of contacts confiscated. To make\nmatters worse, West Berlin was\nriddled with informers and East\nGerman agents.\nThe Wall was responsible for\ninspiring some weird and wonderful\nschemes which put even Colditz to\nshame. One of the strangest occured\nbetween October 1971 and April\n1973, when twenty nine people\nescaped in a converted welding\nmachine which was being regularly\ntransported across the border. The\nmachine had been cleverly\nconstructed so that guards, on\nremoving the panels were confronted\nwith a tangle of wires; the secret inner\ncompartment remaining hidden from\nview. This compartment could only\nbe opened by the simultaneous\noperation of two mechanical switches\nand an electric relay. In 1977, the\nEuropean singer, Thedorus Kerk\nsmuggled Renate Hagen over the\nborder inside a one and a half foot\nsquare loudspeaker case, and in 1941\na girl, acting on the spur of the\nmoment, escaped inside a radiogram.\nOne of the wackiest defections was\ninspired by the Trojan Horse legend.\nInstead of a horse, however, the\nescapee hid inside a model cow which\nwas being transported to the West,\nostensibly for theatrical purposes.\nIn his excellent book 'Escape From\nBerlin' Anthony Kemp tells the story\nof Wolfgang Fuchs, head of an escape\n'firm' known as 'Klunte and Klunte',\nand perhaps the greatest hero in the\nescape business. Staffed by\nvolunteers, Klunte and Klunte was\nfinanced by outside donat or s and\nduring its time managed to rescue\nwell over five-hundred East Germans.\nFuchs' speciality was tunneling and\nbetween 1963 and 1964 Fuchs\norganised the construction of no less\nthan seven tunnels. His last and\ngreatest tunnel became known as\n'tunnel 57', after the 57 people who\nwere brought to West between the 3 rd\nand 5th of October 1964. The tunnel\nstretched for 130 meters between a bakery in the FDR and a disused\napartment in the DDR. It was\nequipped with lighting and ventilation\nunobtrusive groups could be released\ninto the city.\nDisaster struck on the morning of\nOctober the fifth.. .Two men appeared\nat the door to the ap partment and\nbecause they were obviously very\nfrightened the students assumed that\nthey were genuine refugees despite\nthe fact that they did not know the\npassword. The men explained that\nthey would like to go back and collect\na friend who had apparently lost his\nI*[\"AC \u2022\niii <:<\u2022:I''.'> The Brandenburg Gate\nand took a team of forty helpers six\nmonths to construct.\nThe escape operations were carried\nout in strict military style; only those\nindividuals recommended by people\nalready known to the organisation\nwere offered help and potential\ndefectors were rigorously vetted.\nCouriers met their East German\ncontacts at Friedrichstrasse station\nwhere passwords were exchanged. As\nthey made their way to the derelict\napartment, Fuchs watched through\nbinoculars from a roof in the West.\nWhen he was certain that they had not\nbeen followed he radioed the go ahead\nto the student volunteers waiting in\nthe ap partment to open the outside\nnerve. They returned a quarter of an\nhour later with a uniformed soldier.\nOne of the students fired a warning\nshot to give his companions a chance\nto escape; the soldier opened fire and\na fusillade of shots opened out\nthroughout the apartment, which by\nnow was surrounded by the East\nGerman guard. In the crossfire the\nsoldier was killed.\nAlthough it was unclear whether or\nnot the soldier had been killed by the\nstudent or by the crossfire from his\nown people, the DDR extracted the\nmaximum publicity from the case. In\nthe East, civilians were moved out\nfrom houses close to the border and\na wide death strip was established\nThe Isetta bubble car\ndoor. Further passwords were\nexchanged before the escapee would\nbe led to the concealed tunnel,\nentrance. The West lay only a ten\nminute crawl away; once on the other\nside they were scrubbed clean and\ndetained for up to six hours until small\nclose to the wall. Meanwhile,\npreoccupied with negotiations for a day pass system which would allow\ncitizens in the West to visit East\nBerlin, the Western government also\nbegan a clamp down on escape\nactivities.\nFor Fuchs, this was a minor setback\nand he continued with an incredible\nplan which involved driving up to the\nwall in a specially equipped van and\nlowering steps to the other side. After\nmonths of planning, and searching for\na suitable location the stunt was\ncompleted succes fully. Later, Fuchs\nbribed a Syrian diplomat to smuggle\nout refugees. Because the East\nBerliners were anxious to maintain\ngood international relations,\ndiplomatic vehicles received little\nattention at the border, and the Syrian\nmade a number of runs before being\ndiscovered, or more likely betrayed.\nFuchs, however, arranged for the\nSyrian to be given false documents\nwhich enabled him to escape the death\nsentence which would otherwise have\nawaited him on his deportation back\nto Syria.\nWolfgang Fuchs under the guise of\n'Klunte and Klunte' went on to\norganise even more sophisticated\nescapes until his retirement in 1973\nwhen he decided to devote a sensible\namount of time to his family, his\nactivities having already cost him his\nfirst marriage.\nMany of the relics from the more\nsuccessful escape attempts are on\nshow at The Museum Of The Wall\nnear Checkpoint Charlie. One of the\nmost striking exhibits is a tiny Isetta\nbubble car which managed to make\nnine escape runs across the border.\nBecause of their size, bubble cars\nwere never properly searched by the\nVopos guards who assumed that they\nwere too small to contain hidden\npassengers. However, one Westerner\nfound that a small person could be\nsecreted above the engine when the\nair filter and heater were removed and\nthe petrol tank replaced with a small\ncanister. An adjustment to the\nvehicles suspension meant that the\nweight of the extra passenger went\nunnoticed by the Vopos.\nAlso on show are photographs of\na very low slung Austin Healey Sprite\nsports car, with a detachable\nwindscreen. Much to the sup rise of\nthe guards the car was driven\nunderneath the barrier at Checkpoint\nCharlie with a passenger hiding\nbehind the rear seat. The escape\nreceived massive publicity in the\npress, and yet only a week later the\nsame car was successfully used by an\nArgentinian in a repeat performance\nof the same stunt.\nThe lengths to which individuals\nhave gone in the quest for freedom are\nastounding. Balloons, hang-gliders,\nforged passports, and death slides are\njust a few examples. One of the more\nreputable 'escape firms'' even\nmanaged to smuggle out refugees\ncontinued on page 33\nFELLX Monday October 5th19879 "

    "content": "Super discovery\nScientists have still not sorted out the\nmechanism of superconductivity in\nthe new generation of high\ntemperature superconductors. In fact,\nthey do not even seem to understand\neach other's theories.\nHowever, they do now understand\nthe structure of the new compounds.\nX ray diffraction studies have shown\nthat there is a plane of copper and\noxygen atoms with each copper\nsurrounded by four oxygen s( each\noxygen is shared between two\ncoppers). Superconductivity is\nthought to occur in this plane. Various\nstudies (for example, studies of how\nmagnetic fields affect the\nsuperconductivity) have shown that\nthe superconducting bits are highly\nanisotropic\u2014superconductivity\noccurs in the same crystal planes as\nthe CuCh layers.\nThe theoreticians were surprised by\nthe new superconductors: the theory\nthat satisfactorily explains the\nphenomenon in metals breaks down\nin the new ceramics for two reasons.\nFirst the old theory runs into trouble\nbecause of the high temperatures\ninvolved (if you can call - 1 8 0 \u00b0 Ca high temperature), second it predicts\na significant isotope effect on the\ntransition temperature and this has\nbeen sought but not found.\nPhysicists proposed a new model\ninvolving the motion of correlated\nelectron pairs between copper and\noxygen without realizing that their\nmodel was exactly the same as Linus\nPauling's model which involves\nmoving chemical bonds. But what are\nchemical bonds but correlated\nelectron pairs? The trouble is that\nphysicists and chemists do not read\neach other's journals even in fields\nwhere they are both equally\nnecessary. Ceramics are midway\nbetween the world of the physicist and\nthe chemist and both will be needed\nif the new technology of high\ntemperature superconductivity is to be\nunderstood and exploited.\nFeathers fly over Archaeopteryx\nJust down the road from College the\nNatural History Museum has put its\nfossil Archaeopteryx on display in a UNDER MICRO by Steve Black\nYou can help\nThe FELIX Science Page\u2014\nFELIX needs eager readers of the\nscientific pages to compile news\nstories and features for our weekly\nscience page. We will have both short\nnews items and longer features on\ntopical or important subjects. We\nneed contributors from all departments to help us keep everyone\ninterested. If I am the only person to\nwrite this stuff then the science section\nwill be heavily biased towards\nchemistry, and everyone else out\nthere will be bored stiff. Anyway\nworking for FELIX is good for your\nsocial life and looks good on your CV when you want a job (scientists who\ncan string more than two sentences\ntogether without a serious\ngrammatical mistake are still rare\nenough to be valuable).\nHere are some of the things I would\nlike to see features on:\n-Food additives\u2014are they really\nbad for you?\n-How intelligent are intelligent\ncomputers?\n-Chemistry as molecular lego.\n-Quantum mechanics: we\nunderstand the equations, not what\nthey mean.\nYour ideas for features will be\ntaken seriously if you can find\nsomeone who knows enough to write\nthem. Most of all we need people to\nlook out for stories for us. Also, if\nthere are any PGs or members of staff\nout there who have just made some\nearth-shaking discovery, drop us a line before you tell anyone else so we\ncan report it before New Scientist get\nhold of it.\nbullet-proof glass cabinet. Fred Hoyle\nis not pleased.\nArchaeopteryx was a creature with\na reptilian skeleton but well-formed\nfeathers. It is a fairly good example\nof an evolutionary 'missing link'\nbetween birds and reptiles. Fred\nHoyle and his colle ages do not like\nthis as they do not believe in gradual\nevolution.\nHoyle et al are astronomers (some\nunkind biologists say they disbelieve\nevolution because they don't understand it) but they proposed some\nphotographic evidence that the\nfeathers were fake. They wanted to\nperform other tests but these would\nhave required bits of the fossil to be\nknocked off (\"but we only want small\nbits\" Hoyle and friends say) and the\nmuseum have refused their repeated\nrequests. There are only a handful of\nthe fossils in the entire world, so the\nmuseum's stand is probably fairly\nreasonable (would they let Hoyle hack\nbits off the Mona Lisa if he said it was\na fake?).\nThe museum have performed\nvarious tests of their own involving\nspectroscopy\u2014to test for modern\ncement or artificial rock supposedly\nglued to the original reptile\u2014and\nmicroscopy\u2014 to prove that small\ncalcite-filled cracks in the rock carry\nthrough the feather impressions. They\nare convinced the fossil is genuine and\nthey present their evidence in their\nnew display. Hoyle thinks they are\nnot fair to his case: the bullet-proof\ncase is probably a precaution to stop\nhim redressing the balance.\nI would recommend a visit, but you\nhave to pay to get into the museum,\nand I disapprove of that.\nDAT versus CD\nEarly in September a European\nconsortium was set up to develop\noptical disks for computer\ninformation storage; they may be\nwasting their time.\nOrdinary CDs can already hold\ncomputer information, but what\npeople are really waiting for is an\noptical disk that can be written on\nand, preferably, erased as well. Such\ndisks would hold Gigabytes of\ninformation (ie about as much as 1000\nstandard floppy disks). Such disks and\nthe machines are likely to be fairly\nexpensive (IBM are talking about\n\u00a3125 per disk and \u00a34000 per drive.\nRecent advances in DAT( Digital\nAudio Tape, which is based on cheap\nvideo technology) are likely to\nproduce machines at less than \u00a3400\nand cassettes holding 1.2 Gigabytes\nat \u00a38. The only reasons to prefer\noptical disk storage are that the\ntechnology is more elegant and the\ndisks may be much faster if good\nsoftware can be written to get at the\ninformation on them. My bet is on\nDAT: I might at least be able to afford\nit.\nMcDonalds stop poisoning world\nThe world's most famous hamburger\nchain is doing its bit to stop pollution:\nit will soon stop using expanded\npolystyrene containers that contain\nchlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs for\nshort).\nCFCs are common inert chemicals\nused frequently as propellants in\naerosols and in expanded plastics.\nThey are now thought to destroy the\nozone in the upper atmosphere, but\nthe extent of the problem has only\nbecome obvious recently with the\nobservation of a large hole in the\nozone layer over the Antarctic.\nA treaty is now being prepared to\ncommit the world to a drastic\nreduction of CFC use. Without such\na treaty the ozone layer may be\nseriously damaged and more\nultraviolet light from the sun will\nenter the lower atmosphere. This\nwould cause a serious increase in skin\ncancer and cataracts.\nMacDonald s are voluntarily\nabandoning CFCs before they are\nforced to, unfortunately they are not\nabandoning hamburgers as well.\n34 Monday October 5th1987 FELIX\n\n"

The\nHall is situated near Harrods and was\nbought by College 6 years ago.\nHowever, except for a quick flit with a hoover the place hasn't been cleaned\nproperly since. There was however\na fat chance of getting the \u00a34,000 to\nclean it from College. So warden\nKevin O 'Connor negotiated with.'\nsome residents so that they could have\na guaranteed place in Hall for\ncleaning it. A team of 12 have been\nbusy this week working flat out\nwashing and cleaning. The reward for\nmost is their place but some other\nvolunteers are simply being taken out\nfor a meal. Mr O 'Connor said that\nMontpelier Hall residents have been\nrenowned for their good nature, this\nyear they converted a rubble-strewn\ncourtyard into a garden and provided\na large team for last year's Family\nDay.\nHELP AMNESTY!\nAmnesty International will be holding its\nNational Door-to-Door Collection\nbetween 4th and 11th October.

    "content": "Radio GaGa When compared to the relative scarcity of radio\nstations elsewhere in the country, the choice in\nLondon is almost overwhelming. However, it can\nbe surprisingly difficult to find something worth\nlistening to.\nLondon's radio stations can be divided into three\nmain categories\u2014BBC stations, independent\nstations and pirates.\nThe BBC stations are the most well known, and\nmost people will be familiar with the four national\nstations. There are also two London-based\ncommercial stations, Capital and LBC, plus several\nwhich can be picked up from the Home Counties.\nThere is an ever-increasing number of pirate\nradio stations and it is almost impossible to keep\ntrack of them all. Most are concerned chiefly with\nmusic, though there are some that cater for specific\nethnic groups, such as London Greek Radio. Some\nof the stations, such as L GR or Kiss FM are quite\nwell known and of reasonably high quality, but a large number appear only sporadically and suffer\nbadly from poor presentation or poor facilities.\nMost of the London pirate stations are on VHF, and the best way to find them is by slowly turning\nacross the whole band. Even the established stations\nchange their frequency from time to time.\nRadio One's output consists almost entirely of\nmusic, with news at half-past most hours, and a fifteen minute fast-moving programme called\n'Newsbeat' at 12.30pm and 5.30pm. The daytime\nprogrammes are mostly orientated towards popular\nmusic, with the evenings having a few more\nspecialist shows. The BBC chart show is broadcast\neach Sunday between 5pm and 7pm. Radio Two broadcasts twenty-four hours a day;\nmostly 'easy listening' music with news on the hour\nand a sports round-up at 8.50am. The station shares\nits VHF/ FM frequency with Radio 1, so it may not\nalways be possible to hear what you want on\nVHF/ FM. Radio Three is well known for its classical music\nprogrammes, but it also broadcasts plays and\ndiscussions, as well as some Open University\nprogrammes. Overseas students will be glad to\nknow that they can hear the world service news at\n9am and 5pm, with reception considerably better\nthan the World Service medium wave transmitter.\nThere is more to Radio Four than just the\nArchers. It is easily the most informative radio\nstation on the air at the moment. Each day there\nare four main news programmes, plays,\ndocumentaries, magazine programmes and some of\nthe best radio comedy available.\nRadio London is the BBC's local station for the\nLondon area, with a high music content featuring\na wide range of musical styles, including Tony\nBlackburn's soul music programme. Radio London\nalso provides a very good travel information service\nand some programmes for London's ethnic\nminorities. When it is not putting out its own\nprogrammes it relays either Radio 1 or Radio 2\ndepending on which is using the shared VHF/ FM frequency.\nOverseas students may be familiar with the BBC through World Service broadcasts to their own\ncountries. The medium wave service in England\nis broadcast almost entirely in English, and is\nlargely 'speech-based'. The news bulletins give\ndetailed reports from all round the world. All the\nprogrammes on the World Service use GMT, so\nyou have to make allowances for this during British\nSummer Time.\nCapital Radio, which is the most popular\nindependent station, puts out a lot of high quality\nmusic, but has been criticised as being too\n'housewife orientated'. Besides music, there are\nsome comedy programmes, and a fair amount of\nnews is broadcast. On top of this, Capital Radio\npublishes a flat-share list and gives information on\nthe availability of student standby tickets for\nLondon theatres. The Network Chart comes from\nCapital Radio each Sunday, between 5pm and 7pm. LBC provides London with a very\ncomprehensive news and information service, and\nfollowing a recent revamp now has more music than\nit used to. However, the bulk of its output is still\nspeech-orientated, with plenty of phone-ins and\ndiscussions. Sport is well represented with a four\nhour programme at 2pm on Saturday. Geet Mala\nat 9pm each Saturday caters for the Asian\ncommunity, with an Afro-Carribean news\nprogramme at 9.30pm on Sundays.\nRadio Luxembourg is the oldest and largest\ncommercial station in Europe. The English service,\nwhich has been running for more than fifty years,\nbroadcasts from 7pm to 3am each night, though the\ntimes sometimes vary, especially on Sunday\nevenings. The station output consists almost entirely\nof current popular music, with quite a few phone-in competitions, though be warned that these\ninvolve making international calls! Unfortunately,\nreception is not always as good as some of the other\nstations.\nImperial College Radio broadcasts to the\nSouthside halls on medium wave, and by cable to\nmany other places. Programmes consist mostly of\nspecialist programmes together with news and\nfeatures. The exact style of programmes depends\na lot upon who's presenting them. The station is\nrun entirely by students, and definitely has a character of its own.\nOf course this is only a very brief guide to some\nof the stations you can discover on your radio in\nthe London area. If you are new to London it is\nprobably a good idea to turn you dial across the\nwhole range of fr que nci es until you find a station\nwhich suits your taste. Remember that one of the\njoys of radio is, discovering it for yourself.\nRadio Station VHF/FM AM (Medium Wave)\n(MHz) kHz/metres\nRadio 1 89.1* 1089/275\nRadio 2 89.1* 909/330\nRadio 3 91.3 1215/247\nRadio 4 93.5 720/417\nBBC World Service - 648/463\nBBC Radio London 94.9 1458/206\nCapital Radio 95.8 1548/194\nLBC97.31152/261 Radio Luxembourg - 1440/208\nIC Radio 999/301\nLaser - 576/521\nRadio Caroline 558/538\n*Denotes a shared frequency.\nFELIX Monday October 5th198727 "

    "content": "News New school\nopens for\nbusiness\nThe new Imperial College School of\nManagement (ICSM) opened for the\nfirst time this summer under the\ndirectorship of Professor Norburn.\nThe School is a result of the merger\nbetween the Social and Economic\nStudies and Management Science\ndepartments.\nProfessor Norburn intends to make\nICS M one of the top business schools\nin Europe and aims to teach over 400\nstudents how to manage technology\neffectively.\nAt the moment all the courses are\npostgraduate but it is planned to\nintroduce innovative teaching to 300\npostgraduates and around 150\nundergraduates by 1990.\nProfessor Norburn is very keen to\ntake technology-sponsored students\nand proposes that a large degree of\nfunding for the new school comes\nfrom industry. He also wishes to set\nup three research centres jointly with\nindustry and will even have tailor-made courses for the school's sponsoring company.\nLexham\nmoney and\nmail stolen\nA large amount of money was stolen\nfrom electricity meters in Lexham\nGardens flats this summer and several\npeople have complained that mail has\nbeen stolen. The trouble is believed\nto have been connected with a group\nof illegal residents in House 54. A student, who had paid for her flat\nthroughout the summer, let it to a group of men she had met casually.\nThey wrecked the flat and refused to\ngo when Lexham Student Manager\nAaron Kotcheff asked them to leave.\nIt was around this time that money\nand mail were stolen and another flat\nin the same house was burgled.\nAmongst the mail stolen was Mr Kotcheff s new cheque book and bank\nstatement, with which the robber\nwithdrew his entire bank balance. The\nmatter is currently in the police's hands.\nThe illegal residents finally left\nafter Mr Kotcheff switched off their\nelectricity.\nCollege insurance mix-up\nThe Student Union Office is still\ndealing with claims on the Halls\nInsurance Policy. The Policy covers\nthe belongings of all students in\nCollege Residences and Head\nTenancies, and has been administered\nby the Union Honorary Secretary in\nthe last few years.\nOn average there are about a dozen\nclaims every month but last year there\nwere difficulties with claims on the\nPolicy. Paperwork was held up in\nCollege Finance Section and some\nclaims are 11 months late. Student\nResidence Committee (SRC) recently\nhas agreed 'in principle' that the\nadministration of the scheme should\nbe moved away from the Union, but\ndid not decide who should take over\nthe responsibility.\nLesley Gillingham (then Student\nAccommodation Officer) agreed that\nher office should take it over but\nManaging Surveyor Residences Peter\nHallworth later said she had had no\nauthority to make such an agreement.\nIn view of the recent ' re organisation' in the Student\nAccommodation Office, current IC\nUnion Hon Sec Chas Jackson is\ncontinuing to do the job. He told\nFELIX:\" If it wasn't my students\nputting claims in, I would dump it on\nsomeone else's desk right now\", and\nsaid that he was \"not at all happy\".\nHe hopes that once the Student\nAccommodation Office situation\nsettles down they will still be able to\ntake insurance over.\nAnyone who wishes to claim on the\nPolicy should, for the moment,\ncontact Chas Jackson in the Union\nOffice (ext 3503).\nData\nprotection\nImperial College has been issued with\nguidelines on the use of computerised\ninformation outlining the\nrequirements of the Data Protection\nAct. The guide is mainly concerned\nwith access to examination results. It\nsays that candidates should be allowed\n\"the maximum reasonable\" access to\nassessment and examination marks\".\nIt stresses the need to tighten security\nover the information stored,\nespecially of a personal nature.\nBusiness\ninnovation\nThe Student Industrial Society has\nrecently launched its annual\n\"Innovation for Business Award\". The organisers are looking for fresh\nideas which are both creative,\npracticable and have the people\nbehind them to develop the ideas to\ntheir full potential.\nAnyone who would like further\ndetails should contact IC Industrial\nSociety's Chairman Gary Monoghan,\nMaths III.\n\u2022 mm mo\n5 TM\nGeoff Parsons, this year's President of RSMU, was part of the British\nteam sent to the World Athletics Championships in Rome this summer.\nHe achieved tenth place with a jump of 2.25m, behind P Sjoeberg of\nSweden (2.38m), two men from the USSR, I Paklin and G Avdeako (2.38m) and P Moegeburg of West Germany (2.35m). From Rags to\nriches\nAgain this year there will be no Rag\nMag to start the new year. Although\nRag Mag Editor Gehan De Silva had\nmost of the material in time, the\ncensorship put a stop to it. The Board,\nconsisting of the Rag Committee and\nthe Exec, decided that the material\nwas 'unsuitable' with most of it being\ntoo sick or so clean it was unfunny.\nA further problem was encountered\nwhen Mr De Silva had to leave the\ncountry as part of his course. This left\nthe Rag Mag without an Editor, the\nproblem was overcome by forming an\nEditorial Committee with ICU President, Ian Howgate, at the helm.\nThe situation was then exacerbated\nwhen the Rag Chairman, Nigel\nBaker, disappeared with most of the\nrevised material.\nHowever, Mr Howgate told FELIX that the Exec, and anyone else they\nfound in the Bar, had been working\nhard collecting new material which\nthey were very happy with. They\nalready had nearly enough for a complete Mag which included many\noriginal ideas for the layout and\ngeneral concept of the Mag, such as\nforeign language jokes. Nevertheless\nthey would still be grateful for any\nfurther contributions.\nMr Howgate did promise that the\nRag Mag would be ready for Rag\nWeek in mid-November and that it\nwould be a jolly good Rag Mag.

    "content": "Wifa&imu\nThere is a certain monotony in\nlooking back through past years'\nfresher s' FELIX's. Contained within\na sponge of \"welcome to fresher s\" all you can find are the odd currents\nof \"Publications Banned\" and \"New\nBuilding Opened\" flavoured sultanas,\nprecious little else.\nA few dates for your diary: Mech\nEng was completed 1964, Linstead\nDebt: the\nmillstone\naround our\nnecks\nMost students will go overdrawn at\none time or another. With the ever-reducing grant, debt has become a fact of life. A few of you may find\nyourselves going deeper and deeper\ninto debt with easy-to-use credit\ncards and easy-to-sign credit\nagreements.\nIt's a good idea to take some time\nbefore deciding on signing any\nagreement. Don't sign unless you\nunderstand everything in the\nagreement and you're sure you are\ndoing the right thing. Every\ncan cell able agreement must include a box entitled 'your right to cancel' on\nthe form you sign, which will tell you\nthe procedure. Don't forget that you\nmust get a copy of the agreement\u2014\nyou are entitled to this.\nYou can end a hire purchase\nagreement when you have paid back\nat least half the total amount payable\nand you return the goods, as long as\nand the Sports Centre in 1968,\nSherfield in 1969 and Huxley in 1978\n(and already falling down!). The new\nPenney (computing) building was due\nto be ready by the start of this term,\nthe latest estimate is that it will be\nopen in November.\nyou are up to date with the\ninstalments. On the other hand, if you\nwant to settle the account early, you\ncan do so at any time. The goods will\nbe yours and you should also be\nentitled for a rebate.\nAnother way of regulating your\ncash flow is a credit card. These\nusually either require you to settle\nyour account each month or to pay off\na set minimum account at the end of\nthe month, interest being charged on\nthe balance remaining. Either way\nyou have the advantage of a month's free credit. However, some people\nrefuse to have a credit card on the\ngrounds that it's too easy to get deep\ninto debt. You have to be sensible if\nyou leave a lot of money unpaid it is\na very expensive way of borrowing\u2014\nif you're charged 2% interest per\nmonth, for example, you will be\npaying 26.8% in a year. That's about\ntwice the overdraft interest rates!\nCredit cards have other advantages\nlike foreign use and acceptance in\nother countries.\nThere are still more ways of getting\ncredit, which can be useful if you\nwant to make a 'major investment' for\nexample. Always shop around for the\nbest interest rates (usually known as\nthe Annual Percentage Rate\u2014APR).\nIt's a mistake to over-commit yourself\nand don't forget to check every bit\nof small print, because once you sign\na credit agreement it is legally\nA number of student publications\nare produced over the summer,\nparticularly the Rag Mag, and the\nUnion Handbook. Recently there has\nbeen much discussion, once the\nstudents have returned after the\nvacation, as to the rights and wrongs\nbinding\u2014you'll be liable whether you\nread it or not. Only use reputable,\nlong-established companies and don't take any salesperson's/ advisor's word\nfor granted. Check it out yourself:\nAlso keep a copy of the agreement\nand any other papers, in a safe place.\nIf you are offered free credit, also\ncheck that the individual payments\ndon't add up to more than the single\npayment price.\nYou don't have to live very\nextravagantly to get into debt.\nUnexpected or just under-estimated\nexpenses can make all the difference\nbetween having things under control\nand an ever-increasing overdraft. The\nmost important thing to do is to act\nimmediately.\nA good way to start is by listing all\nyour outgoing s and income. Calculate\nyour disposable income (the amount\nleft after really essential expenses)\nthen work out the hightest debt\npriorities. It's most important to keep\na roof over your head. Then sort out\nfuel bills and hire purchase debts, as\nyou could be cut off or have your\ngoods repossessed.\nTell your personal tutor if you are\nhaving serious money problems and\nhave a chat with the Welfare Advisor,\nLinda Simmons.\nTry to cut down on non-essentials.\nYou may be able to sell something to\nbring in some extra money, but never\nsell anything for which you still owe\nof the censorship imposed by the\nsabbaticals. Two years ago the Rag\nMag was banned by the sabbaticals,\na ban which was then lifted by aUG M, but this isn'ta recent\nphenomena, in 1967 the Rag Mag was\nbanned; FELIX reported brisk sales\n'under the counter' in an attempt to\nrecoup the losses.\nEven the welcome stays the same.\n1961 President 'Seaforth Lyle'\nwarned, on the front page of FELIX, that \"the dislike of apathy is not just\na whim of the senior students\". The\nmajor change seems to be that in those\ndays there were was not \"Freshers\"\nbut \"Freshmen\".\nThe tasty bits of icing include the\nagenda for fresher sU GM in 1981,\nwhich contained a motion proclaiming\nthe Chairman aba ff o on, and\ninstructing him to wear a \"clowns \"red\nnose\" at all meetings and in 1968,\nwhen the then RCS Vice President\nwas arrested on a Peace March after\nallegedly throwing a stone at the\npolice. His alibi was that he was\nwalking away, composing poetry at\nthe time.\nFinally though, perhaps the most\nsignificant item to appear in a Freshers' F ELK must be a news item\nfrom 1965, announcing \"Natural Gas\nhad been found in the North Sea\".\nmoney. See if you can end any hire\npurchase agreements you have.\nNow you should deal with your\nother creditors. Be honest with them.\nGo and see your bank manager and\nsee if you can arrange an extended\noverdraft, if necessary. Never take out\nan extra loan to pay off all your debts\nat once, such as those advertised in\nnewspapers. Even if you can get the\nloan, you will almost certainly end up\ndeeper in debt as the terms are less\nthan generous.\nSending your creditors a financial\nstatement would show that you are\nbeing realistic. You could offer to pay\nback a smaller amount regularly\u2014but\ndon't offer more than you will be able\nto afford. Keep a copy of all the letters\nyou send as well as keeping any you\nreceive.\nIf you are being harrassed by your\ncreditors, contact the Welfare\nAdvisor. Creditors are allowed to\nremind you of your debt occasionally\nbut they may not phone late at night,\ncall every five minutes, station\nconspicuous 'Debt Collection' vans\nnear your home and so on.\nIt's most unlikely you will have any\nmajor problems with money, but if you do there are always plenty of\npeople who are in a good position to\nadvise you. If you keep an eye on\nyour finances you will be able to spot\nany worrying trends and put a stop to\nthem!\n12 Monday October 5th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The National Portrait\nGallery\nALTHOUGH portraits have never\nbeen my favourite form of art, the\nNational Portrait Gallery is definitely\nhigh on my list of favourite museums.\nUnlike other galleries, the portraits\nhave a short explanatory note about\nthe subject which is a godsend for\nanyone who isn't well versed in\nfamous people. The mixture of media\nincludes photographs, paintings,\ndrawings and cartoons and helps to\nincrease the interest. The 20th Century gallery provides an\ninvaluable history lesson on notable\nfigures of our time from the fields of\nart, science and politics. In addition\nto the numerous permanent\ncollections, there are usually one or\ntwo special exhibitions on at any one\ntime. At present there are two\u2014Clive\nBarker's Portraits and In Close\nUp.Laurence Olivier, both relatively\nsmall exhibitions which can\ncomfortably be viewed in an hour or\ntwo.\nIn Close Up:\nLaurence Olivier\nTHE OLIVIER exhibition is again\ncompact, but contains some delightful\nfilm stills and posed portraits (the\nresemblance of the young Sir Larry\nto Timothy Dalton is uncanny). The\nRoyal Dalton porcelain, model is an\ninteresting novelty. Showing some of\nhis film work is a good idea, however\nthe addition of a small television\ndelivering tinny monologues is too\nmuch of a gimmick and distracts from\nthe main exhibition.\nPortraits\nCLIVE BARKER was previously\nnoted for his pop art, detailing\ncrushed cigarette packets and chrome\nplating coke bottles. In this collection,\nhis 53 oil pastel portraits of fellow\nartists, critics and friends are rather\nhit and miss. They employ a variety\nof bright contrasting colours which\ncan work very well as shown by the\nportraits of George Melly (used to\nadvertise the exhibition) and Peter\nBlake. However, in the main they fail\nto please. In addition to the portraits\nthere are four examples of his\nsculpture on display which are a welcome bonus, in particular his Selfportrait with bananas.\nIntroducing Sculpture\nDOWNSTAIRS in the basement is an\ninteresting little exhibition giving an\nintroduction to sculpture. This is well\nworth a visit as it provides a guide to \u2022\nthe various techniques involved,\ncarefully distinguishing between\nsculpting (working down from a lump\nof stone or wood to the finished article\neg marble busts) and modelling\n(working up from a frame adding\nmaterial to make a likeness eg clay\nmodels from which bronze casts are\nmade). Notable exhibits include the\ndeath mask of Oliver Cromwell and\na wonderful wooden statue of James\nJoyce. A.N. Albums\nWonderful Life\u2014Black\nSelf confessed crooner Colin Vearmombe has crammed a pretty\nmixed bag onto Wonderful Life. The\nvariety is good ignoring the empty\npop of songs like / just grew tired,\nwhen things get rather tedious.\nSmarmy American female backing\nsuggests a funky Phil Collins, while\nin some places the sound is\nreminiscent of Culture Club or\u2014dare\nI say it\u2014Tears for Fears.\nHowever, all is not lost. There are\nsome real gems amidst the striking\ncontrasts of the brilliant title track and\nthe classy, melancholy Sweetest\nSmile. PS.

    "content": "FELIX Cookery Club\nKATHY TAIT\nUnion Receptionist\nWhilst inter railing last year, one of\nthe countries I visited was Hungary.\nAs I like food very much, I stayed\nthere for quite some time! I absolutely\nloved their goulash, but as I 've never\nbeen very good at remembering\nrecipes I 've adapted the goulash a bit.\nSo it's a mixture between my mam s broth and a cassa role. I call it Kathy's Special! Another one of my faults is\nthat I never measure anything, so I suggest you adapt the quantities to\nyour own taste.\nThe Ingredients\nServes 4\n1 carton of sour cream (you can\nuse natural yogurt)\n1 small tin of tomatoes\n1 medium onion\n1 red pepper\n1 tablespoon of tomato puree\n5 or 6 small mushrooms\n2 cloves of garlic\n3 small carrots\n1 small courgette\n1 handful of frozen peas\n1 slash of Worcester sauce\nA good helping of black pepper\nPinch of salt\nPinch mixed herbs\n1 bottle of wine (red)\nYou can make this with any bit of\nmeat you fancy. I usually use stewing\nsteak, and cut it up quite small. But\nI have used chicken and even\nsausages. Even if you're not a meat\neater, why not add more vegetables\nwhich I 've done when we've been a bit hard up!\nThe Method (I think)\nUse medium size casserole dish. Fry\nyour meat first, coat the meat in\nseasoned flour. I use a little butter to\nfry in. Don't over fry it, just brown\nit a little. When done, pop it in your\ndish and bung in the oven to keep\nwarm. Oh I forgot, set your oven at\nno 6. Then fry your roughly cut\nonions till they are soft. Same with\nthe red peppers. Put them both in the\npot. Now for the carrots and\ncourgette s, fry them with a little\nbutter and add a little water just till\nthey are a bit soft. Add them to the\npot.\nPut the tomatoes and puree in the\npot together with your roughly cut\ngarlic. Mix them all together. You now can add the rest of your\ningredients. Be very careful when\nadding your wine, as you have to reassure your guests that a bottle of\nwine has gone into your dinner, when\nin fact, you only need to put V* of a70 cl bottle in, the rest you can drink!\nAdd the sour cream last or yogurt\n(Greek yogurt is the best).\nThis dish doesn't always turn out\nnecessarily the same every time, but\nit's interesting finding out what it\nactually does taste like!\nI usually serve it with boiled rice,\nbut it's nice with roast potatoes. The\nbest thing about it is when you've got\neverything in the dish, you can almost\nforget about it for VA hours apart\nfrom the occasional stir.\nThe British Red Cross Society\nwill be running a standard\ncertified first aid course starting\non Monday October at 6pm. The\ncourse will run each Monday at\n6pm until the examination night,\nMonday 14th December. The\ncourse will be held in the Holland\nClub. The course is limited to\nabout 20 members, and the cost\nof the course (including book and\nexamination) is \u00a312.\nDie Mauer-continued\nusing forged United Nations\npassports. Incredibly this ploy\ncontinued successfully when the East\nGermans discovered that the United\nNations did not issue these particular\ndocuments\u2014so concerned were they\nto avoid a diplomatic incident. One\nEast German engineer managed to\nmake a small fortune by patenting his\nescape apparatus in the West. In fact\nthe engineer had managed to build the\nworld's first mini submarine which he\nused to power his way to the West\nunderwater, after having first\nremoved some of the spiked sub-aqua\ngrids which were installed to protect\nthe waterways.\nYet for every successful attempt\nthere are a far greater number of\nfailures. According to Western\nfigures seventy five people have died\ntrying to cross the wall, but the actual\nfigure is probably much higher.\nHundreds more have been injured or\nimprisoned. The brutality of the\nEastern Regiem was brought sharply\ninto focus by the protracted death of\na seventeen year old boy. Peter\nFecher, a Red Youth leader and a friend decided to make a dash for it\none night at a point close to\nCheckpoint Charlie. Under a hail of\nbullets, Peter's friend managed to\ndiplomats were the subject of verbal\nabuse and stoning for some time\nafterwards.\nEscape is regarded as a serious\noffence by the East German\nauthorities, with the penalty for\nfleeing the Republic Republicflucht\u2014set at six years. Westerners\ncaught aiding escapees are invariably\naccused of kidnapping the citizens of\nthe DDR against their wishes; they\nare said to be agents sent by Bonn to\nde stabilise the border. After a trial of\nsorts a long prison sentence and\nenforced labour await, though, for\nWesterners at least, there is always\nthe possibility that Bonn might buy\nthem out of jail. Conditions in East\nGerman prisons are decidedly\nunpleasant; the food is barely edible\nand medical treatment is available\nonly on a six week waiting list\u2014even\nthen the treatment is usually wrong.\nThere is however a glimmer of hope\nfor those trapped behind the wall. In\nthe wake of the recent summit\nbetween the leaders of East and West\nGermany new hopes have been raised\nfor greater freedom for the East\nGermans. Senior officials in the\nDDR's SED( Socialist Unity) Party\nhave hinted that greater priority might\nbe placed on reuniting divided\nStiXs\nE Li\ns if!|f B*B haul himself through the barbed wire\nabove the wall, but Peter, hit by\nseveral shots, fell back into the East.\nThen, in an incident recorded by\nWestern TV cameras, the Vopos\nsurrounded the dying boy, but made\nno attempts to answer his cries for\nhelp. It took one hour for Peter\nFecher to bleed to death before the\nvo pos removed his limp body. It was\nnot surprising large scale\ndemonstrations followed in West\nBerlin, nor that Russian troops and\nfamilies and Mr Honnecker has called\nfor greater unity between the two\nGermanies. Yet it is clear that the wall\nis here to stay. The economic and\nidealogical differences between the\ncultures on each side of the wall\nleaves the DDR with no alternative\nother than to maintain the Status Quo.\nCredits; thanks to The Museum ofthe\nWall in West Berlin, and Kamala Sen\nfor German translation and some\nexcellent artwork.\nFELIX Monday October 5th198733 "

The best meals are the BBQ ribs\nwhich come with a salad and a choice of potatoes.\nEverything's guaranteed to add inches to your waistline.\nBetween 9pm and 11pm they usually have live Country\n& Western music which competes with the numerous TV sets showing ghastly spaghetti westerns.\nSouth Ken Pasta Bar\n60 Old Brompton Road, SW3\n7 days, noon-3pm,5.30 pml1.30 pm Walking distance\nThe garlic bread is quite delicious as are the mouthwatering starters. They do extra large portions for \u00a31.00 I extra if you're feeling really piggish.\nHenry J Bean's54 Abingdon Road, W8\nMon-Sat, 11.30am11.45 pm Sunday, Noon-10.30pm Tube: High Street Ken\nThis is another American restaurant, perhaps even more\ngenuine than the Texas Lone Star, as it imported all the\npine fittings from Chicago! You order your food at a counter as you buy the drinks and then pick it up a few\nminutes later. The food's great! The atmosphere is\ndefinitely 'loud' American. There's also a sister restaurant\nin King's Road, Chelsea, which maybe nearer for Evelyn\nGardens residents.\nSeafresh Fish Bar\n80-81 Wilton Road, SW1\nMon-Sat, noon-3pm,5 pm ll pm Tube: Victoria\nThis place does sell very fresh fish unlike most of its\ncompetitors.

There is a large menu with glories such\nas stuffed onions and boiled ox tongue. If you don't fancy\nsuch meals then you must try it, if only for the delicious\ncontinental pastries it serves.\nAmbrosiana Creperie\n194 Fulham Road, SW10\n7 days, noon-midnight\nWalking distance\nA French Creperie with hot, wide and juicy crepes\nfeaturing exotic fillings such as mozzarella & artichoke!\nAstrix\n329 Kings Road, SW3\n7 days, noon-midnight\nWalking distance\nSlightly better than Ambrosiana's because all the\ningredients are fresh where possible.

For \u00a32.60 you\ncan have pasta and one of their ten sauces and between\nMonday and Thursday they keep on filling up your plate\nat no extra cost! Consequently, this restaurant is very\npopular. If you don't like queuing then try Fatso's in\nRichmond or Queensway as their atmospheres are much\nmore pleasant.\nLidos\n41 Gerrard Street, Wl\n7 days, 4pm4.30 am Tube: Leicester Square\nIf you ever feel peck ish in the early hours of the morning\nthen just hop on a night bus to Soho and visit this\nrestaurant. It serves Cantonese food until 4 in the morning\nand the portions are enormous. Watch out tor the type\nof customer at that time in the morning though\u2014we did\nwarn you.\nUpstairs\n8 Basil Street, SW3\nMon-Sat, noon-3pm Walking distance\nThis restaurant is a bit up-market as it lies in the heart\nof Knightsbridge. The best choice is the salad, which you\ncan pile onto your plate until it begins to fall off. Definitely\na place to practise your salad architecture.\nDiwana Bhel Poori House\n121 Drummond Street, NW1\n7 days, noon-ll pm Tube: Euston Square or 73 bus\nAnother Indian vegetarian but one of the best in London.\nIt's very popular, so you'll have to queue at peak times.\nMost snacks cost in the region of \u00a31.25 and the\n'Annapurna' includes a dessert for under \u00a34.\nFELIX Monday October 5th198725 "

This\nevent was even filmed by the BBC this summer.

We all\nlook forward to Friday mornings, because FELIX is the\nonly place where we can find out what is going on in\nCollege at the human level.\nBecause Imperial College is so large, FELIX provides\nwhatever there is of a College spirit. Naturally this comes\ninitially from individuals like the Rector, the Students'\nUnion President and so on, who have a role to play, and\nfrom those members of College who have ideas which they\nhave expressed publicly or in the form of reviews or\narticles in your columns.\nIn my opinion this admittedly elusive spirit is worth a great deal more than all the spirit you find in the College\nbars. It is the only antidote we have for the depression\nthat the universities are subjected to these days. And you\nare its custodian. So please do not waste your golden\nopportunities to help Imperial College by playing silly\ngames. By all means publish the truth, so that real\nincompetence will be exposed, academic shortcomings put\nright, and administrative errors corrected, but please spare\nus the excesses of your 'libel' page, as in your first issue\nof 14 August, 1987. (Is it a coincidence that no mention\nwas made of the Phalix Editor, Miss Hack?) The Baron\nof Cheapskate was often very funny but its successor\nsimply left a bad taste.\nWhich, if you will permit, brings me to my last point.\nAs Chairman of the Students' Residence Committee for\nthe last three years, I have worked closely with Michael\nArthur, and have come to respect his ability and\ncommitment for the College's good. It has therefore been\na matter of great surprise to me that Michael persistently\ngets such a bad press. Ian Howgate was gracious enough\nto say some kind things in the last FELIX about me as\nChairman of SRC. In my turn, I would like to say that\nImperial College is lucky to have such a competent and\ndedicated administrator as Michael Arthur.\nYours sincerely\nRichard H Clarke\nElectrical Engineering Department\nWarden of Linstead Hall\nFor those of you who didn't catch the Postgraduate issue\nof FELIX, the Libel page consisted of several gossipy\nanecdotes, each having at least two different sources. It\ncontained a piece on the President's bad taste in clothing,\nseveral Evelyn Gardens stories and one regarding Mr\nArthur's failure to add VAT on the cost of renting rooms\nfor the Summer Letting Scheme. I consider the last of these\nto be genuine incompetence. Perhaps the 'excess' you refer\nto was the obviously fictional story we printed on the same\npage. Please do not make the mistake of confusing fact\nwith fiction.\nPresident's ignorance\nDear Judith,\nHowgate's Half Hour (Issue No. 777) was read with\nalmost as much humour as Hancock's original 30 minutes.\nHis comments concerning the University of London's Management Audit Offices draft report on the\nintercollegiate halls are extremely short-sighted and he is\nobviously subject to the same ignorant and blinkered\nimpressions of the intercollegiate halls as are many IC\nstudents.\nSome of the report's recommendations are\ncommendable\u2014centralisation ef purchasing certain\nadmins t rational duties particularly\u2014however there are also\nsome proposals that will prove extremely detrimental to\nthe life of students in the halls.\nThere is a plan to merge all three halls of Cartwright\nGardens into one hall, more than twice the size of the\nwhole of Southside. To introduce first year students into\na hall with no identity smaller than 1000 students would\nbe disastrous. Experience has shown that large halls do\nnot work well for the student. I am not aware that any\nof the seven intercollegiate halls shut for half the summer.\nGrants continue to be cut and halls live on the bread line. The proposals also put the decision-making in the hands\nof the bursars rather than the part-time wardens who\ngenerally d is gard the more dangerous proposals from the\nUniversity. The Bursars do not do this and put in a position\nof power would exercise a general disregard for student\naffairs.\nAll the halls should not be tarred with the same brush.\nIt is true, some are inefficient and wasteful but in my\nexperience the majority are still better run than we are\nled to believe most Imperial halls are.\nIn short, Howgate, how about checking the views of\nsome of the students involved before mouthing off in the\nmagn amino us manner for which you are well known.\nLook at the problems of our own halls before you start\nbranching out to the University as a whole\u2014or is this part\nof your campaign to become UL U President?\nYours,\nJon Wurr\nUseful tip\nDear Judith\nHere is a useful tip for your readers. I have discovered\nthat many of the letters I send through the College internal\nmail do not reach their destination. I have solved this\nproblem by writing the name of the person to whom I wish\nto send the letter on the envelope. This useful technique\nhas saved me hours of wasted time.\nYours\nBill Goodwin\nWealth jeo pardi sed Dear Judith\nI am shocked and appalled at London Regional\nTransport's latest decision to ban eating and drinking on\nthe tube. What will students do? The Circle Line Party,\nan annual event of note at College, is in jeopardy. Many\nstudents will arrive in College without breakfast, which\nthey would normally have eaten On the tube. The resulting,\ndangerously low blood sugar levels will seriously effect\nstudents' academic performance and hence the wealth of\nthe nation.

    "content": "FELIX Letter\nAC battery shocker\nAcademics at Imperial College are yet\nagain at the forefront of a new\ntechnology. Most of you will have\nheard of Zinc-Carbon, ManganeseAlkaline and Nickel Cadmium\nbatteries but soon they will be\nsuper seeded in some applications by\nZirconium-Technetium cells. FELIX spoke exclusively to the head of the\nproject, Prof E Verreday of the Dept\nof Physics.\nCan you tell us about Zirconium\u2014\nTechnetium cells?\nYes.\nPlease will you?\nThe different combinations of chemicals in a cell produces a different form of energy release curve\nlike this:\nZirconium-Technetium cells behave\ntotally differently in that instead of\nmaintaining a constant voltage which\ndrops off, the voltage drops\nimmediately and continues through\nzero to a negative voltage of the same\nmagnitude, it then reverses and flows\nback to + VC. This oscillation\ncontinues with a fractional energy loss\neach time so that the energy release\ngraph looks like this:\nIn other words, you have invented\na.c. batteries?\nYes. Although strictly speaking they\nare alternating voltage cells (AVC's). What frequency do AVC's oscillate\nat?\nnormal modes of oscillation but we\nare working on producing different\nfrequencies by altering the relative\namounts of each constituent and-trying small quantities of other\nsubstances to see what effect they\nhave.\nWhat voltages do the cells have?\nThey have been made in all popular\nsizes; HP7, HP2, HP11, etc.\nIn what applications will AVC's be\nused?\nThe main use we see for them is that\nthey will allow ac motors to be used\nin much smaller applications than is\ncurrently available. Your readers will\nprobably notice them first in things\nlike personal stereos and cassette\ndecks. There are literally thousands\nof applications for the AVC.\nAre any companies funding your\nresearch?\nWe are currently negotiating with\nmany people about financial\nassistance to continue the project.\nWhen are we likely to see AVC's in\nthe shops?\nWe anticipate commercial production\nby 1991.\nAnd they will presumably make you\na very rich person?\nAt the moment we only have two Hopefully.\nWhereas Manganese-Alkaline and\nNickel-Cadmium cells produce a much sharper cut off of voltage like\nthis:\nI should like to take this opportunity\nto reiterate my tedious opinions about\nanonymous letters in FELIX. I may\nbe completely out of touch with the\nstudents at this College, and I may\nhave no idea what complete bastards\nsome senior tutors are, but there is\nabsolutely no excuse for the sort of\nletter you carried in your Easter\nedition. If any students have problems\nwith their course they should follow\nthe normal channels for making\ncomplaints. Firstly, they should\ncontact their academic year rep or\nDepartmental Representative.\nNormally both of these people can be\nrelied upon to forget about such\nmatters, and clearly this is the\nsimplest and most efficient way to sort\nout any difficulties. On the off chance\nthat the matter is raised at the\ndepartmental staff-student committee\nwe can normally rely on the Director\nof Undergraduate Studies to dismiss\nthe plaintiff with patronising remarks\nabout lack of commit t ment from their\nstudents. In the very unlikely event\nthat some self-important Academic\nAffairs Officer brings the matter to\nthe College's Board of Studies,\nImperial employs a College Tutor\nwho will always display a great deal\nof sympathy for the Students' course,\nand will recommend that a subcommittee be set up to look into the\nissue. Hence there are three levels of\nrepresentation which may be used to\ndiffuse any academic problems. If any\nstudent is dissatisfied, my wife and\nI are fully prepared to meet them for\nan informal discussion over dinner.\nThere is and cannot be any\njustification for any spineless jerk to\nwrite anonymously to FELIX. We must all be careful to protect the\ninflated reputation of Imperial College\nin case the UGC discovers what a shitty life most students lead.\nI hope that you will pay more\nattention than your predecessor to this\nmatter.\nYours\n32 Monday October 5th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "the loan\narrangers\nOnce upon a time\nwhen things were what\nthey used to be,\nbanking was a straightforward affair.\nAs a customer, it was\na matter of handing\nover the cash and\nletting the experts deal\nwith it. Nowadays,\nhowever, audience\nparticipation is called\nfor. First you select\nthe financial institution\n(don't forget building\nsocieties). Then you\nare confronted by a barrage of 'five star\ncurrent twenty-seven\nmonth dual\ncheque book accounts';\n'student piggy bank\nunder sevens \u00a35,000\noverdraft' accounts\nand the like while\njuggling various pieces\nof plastic, before you\nmeet on of a collection\nof advisors who will\neventually consent to\ndeal with your money.\nUnfortunately, it seems likely to get\nmore rather than less complicated.\nStudents are very good business for\nbanks: they have aten dancy to get\nexecutive jobs with executive salaries\nand may even need the odd loan on\nthe way. In order to get these student\naccounts, the banks pull out all the\nstops to appear friendly, legal, decent,\nhonest, truthful, etc, etc, as well as\nshowering the hapless individual with\nenough free gifts to set up a small\nretail business. In fact, the various\naccounts on offer are fairly similar as\nregards services: a cheque guarantee\ncard once your grant cheque has been\npaid in, a cheque book and a cash\npoint card, statements, standing\norders and so on are all standard.\nWhat's really worth\nconsidering is how\nmuch it's all going\nto cost.\nIt's a sad fact that\nabout 5 0 % of students overdraw\nat some time.\nIf you are likely\nto do so, you will\nprobably want a bank which offers\ncheap overdrafts.\nMost banks will\ncharge students a low rate of interest\nand waive bank\ncharges on pre-arranged, limited\nloans. Exceptions\nto this are The Bank\nof Scotland and\nAllied Irish. Two\nbanks, Midland and\nClydesdale, will\neven give interest-free overdrafts of\nup to \u00a3100 if arranged before-hand.\nWARNING: if you don't arrange\nyour overdraft before going into the\nred, or if you exceed your overdraft\nlimit, you will have to pay some\npretty steep charges.\nSome banks/building societies give\ninterest when your account is in\ncredit. This could be worth quite a lot,\nbut check the overdraft policy before\ncommitting yourself. The Nationwide, for example, gives free\nbanking on an agreed overdraft, but\ndoes have cheap interest rates for\noverdrawn students. It could work out\nmore expensive than a normal account\nwith lower interest rates, depending\non the average state of your bank\nbalance.\nJust about every current account\nen tides you to a cash point card. It's very handy to be able to get cash\noutside the amazingly inconvenient\nbank opening hours. All the major\nbanks except Lloyds operate twenty-four hour cashpoint service, but be\nprepared for cashpoint s which have\nrun out of money or generally don't work.\nAs well as dispensing cash, the\nmachines have other facilities. You\nshould usually be able to find out your\nbalance as at the end of the previous\nday, at least. The Royal Bank of\nScotland (RBS) even provide a mini\nstatement with your last three\ntransactions, although you can't order\nfull statements there. You can also\nmake deposits at the cashpoint s of\nsome banks (including the RBS).\nNot only can you use your bank's amazing cashpoint facilities, but if\nyou're a long way\nfrom a branch\nwith a machine or\nif the nearest one\nis broken down,\nyou can use the\nmachine at another bank. There\nare three main\ncashpoint groups,\nas follows: Bank\nof Scodand (BS),\nLloyds, Barclays\nand Royal Bank\nof Scotland;\nClydesdale, Mid land, NatWest,\nNorthern and\nTSB are to join;\nNationwide, Coop and Girobank.\nYou can use a card from a particular bank at\nany of the others\nin the same\ngroup, although\nyou may not be\nable to use all the\nnormal services.\nA word of warning about cheque\ncards which also act as cashpoint\ncards: it is less plastic to carry around\nbut if you lose your card or a machine\neats it, you might have trouble getting\nhold of money.\nFELIX Monday October 5th198713 "

    "content": "News Hamlet house of horror SUMMER Letting Scheme (SLS)\nguests caused serious damage to head\ntenancy flats in Hamlet Gardens this\nSummer. As well as disturbing\nnearby residents and throwing litter\nout of the windows, some of the\nguests had as sul ted the SLS Managers, damaged parked cars in\nthe area and one group had sold\nfurniture from their flat.\nHamlet Warden Geoff Hungerford\nsaid that SLS guests gave the flats a \"real beating\" each year. The guests\nwho had caused most trouble were\nstudents from a University in the\nRepublic of Ireland. Mr Hungerford\nsaid that although he had warned the\nStudent Accommodation Office, the\nsame people who had created major\nproblems last year had been allowed\nto return. Even some students who\nwere evicted after throwing a television through a window were\ngiven flats again this year.\nMr Hungerford said that the\nstudents had known that a court case\nagainst them would take more than\nthree months, and so they could not\nbe evicted even though they had not\npaid their rent. He said this summer\nhad been particularly bad now that the\nstudents knew what they could get\naway with. The SLS Managers were\nshocked to discover the condition of\nthe flats when the guests had moved\nout. Mark Cottle, one of the\nManagers, commented: \" if we hadn't been there, there wouldn't be any\nbuildings left\".\nA visit by senior College officials,\nChief Engineer David Evans and\nCollege Deputy Secretary Brian\nLloyd Davis, was organised by ICU President Ian Howgate when he was\ninformed of the extent of the\nproblems. Mr Lloyd Davies and Mr Evans were reported to have been\ndeeply concerned and Mr Evans\n'if we hadn't been there, there wouldn't be any buildings left'\nimmediately arranged for the flats to\nbe put in good order.\nMany of the flats have been\ncompletely repainted and a lot of furniture has had to be replaced. Mr Hungerford was very pleased with the\ncondition of the redecorated flats and\nwhen asked on Friday, he said that he\nwas confident that they would be\nready for the students to move in to\nat the start of term.\n\u2022 Ninety seven new students were\ndue to move into Hamlet Gardens\nover the weekend, although there\nwere only ninety two places available.\nMr Hungerford said that he thought\nthis would not present a problem as\nthere are always some students who\ndo not take up their places.\nThere will be more than twice as\nmany fresher s in Hamlet this year\nthan there were last year. Some\nconcern has been voiced about the\nsuitability of Hamlet for Freshers.\nSubwarden Chris Griffen said that he\ndid not think the accommodation or\nsocial life was appropriate for first\nyears, many of whom had just left\nhome.\nAccommodation Office shake-up\nSTUDENT Accommodation Officer\nLesley Gillingham was removed from\nher post by College Managing\nSurveyor, Peter Hallworth two weeks\nago. Assistant College Secretary\nMichael Arthur has been left in\ncharge until a new Student\nAccommodation Manager has been\nfound. The position is to be linked\nwith that of a Senior Housekeeper to\nprovide a closer link with hall\nadministration and a more \"smooth\nand efficient service\".\nMr Hallworth said Ms Gillingham\nwas removed after a series of\ncomplaints including those from\nseveral Wardens. It appears that\nletters had been sent out late, resulting\nin anxious Freshers telephoning\nbecause they had only two days in\nwhich to reply. Some letters contained\nno reply slips and non-existant\naccommodation had been offered. Mr Hallworth said that staff morale had\nbeen at a low ebb and there were\nnotices in the office which he\nconsidered to be \"offensive\" and\n\"not welcoming\". He said that such\na drastic decision had been a hard one\nto make but it had \"proved to be the\nright one\". He wants the post to be\nfilled by \"somebody who cares\".\nGravel money to be invested\nIT has been decided by the Finance\n& Executive (F&E) Committee that\nmoney raised by the sale of gravel at\nHarlington will be invested over the\nnext few years. It was initially\nbelieved that College administration\nwished to use the money to back up\ntheir cash flow reserve. This was\ndiscovered when Harlington income\nfigures appeared in cash flow\ncalculations in the appendix of a paper\nwhich was presented to the\nCommittee. After the\nmisunderstanding was cleared up, it\nwas decided that a separate\ninvestment fund would be set up by\nthe Investments Committee of Governing Body to be jointly\nadministered by the Chairman of\nGoverning Body and the President of\nthe Union.\nIt has been rumoured that the Union\nExecutive wish to set up a Union\nInvestment Committee to advise the\nPresident, and that ex-ICU President\nNick Norton may be asked to Chair\nthis Committee.\nA final decision will be made at the\nnext F&E in November.\n'Irresponsible' Ian attacks planned\nFreshers' Week entertainment\nENTERTAINMENTS Officer John\nNoble has slammed comments made\nby ICU President Ian Howgate as\n\" irresponsible\". John was\nresponding to comments made in an\ninterview Ian Howgate recorded with\nIC Radio before the start of term and\nwhich is due to be broadcast on\nWednesday.\nIn it Ian pays tribute to the hard\nwork put in by John, but says \"I don't think we have a terribly good\nselection of bands in Freshers'\nWeek\". He admits \"it's better than\nother London colleges\" but adds \"I don't really think it's good enough\".\n' T have'', he continued ' 'plans afoot\nto re vital is e the entertainments\nsystem; I'm talking about getting us\nup into the big time. How I'm going\nto do that is something I really can't say at the moment\".\nJohn Noble told FELIX\" I hope no\none will listen to him; we have a brilliant Freshers' Week, and lots of\npeople were consulted over which\nbands to have, he shouldn't make\nirresponsible statements like that\". It\nwas, he added, the first time he had\nheard the statement.\nThe two other Union Sabbaticals\nsaid Mr Howgate's views on the\nbands were not Union policy and\nwere his own opinion. ICU Deputy\nPresident Alan Rose said \"as far as\nI know all these bands are supposed\nto be great fun and that's what\nFreshers' Week is all about.\nBands playing in Freshers' Week\ninclude Voice of the Beehive and the\nBlue Aeroplanes, along with Rent\nParty and Salvation Sunday.\nJohn Noble later made the\nfollowing statement:\n\"I think an important point to make\nis that what Ian is trying to say is that\nin a perfect world everything would\nbe sweetness and roses. We would not\nhave the restriction of a closed club\nlicence on our hands, we would not\nhave problems with apathy and we\nwould not have problems concerning\nour venue size. However the reality\nof the situation is that we have these\nproblems and many more. My duty\nis to operate within the bounds laid\ndown by Council and most\nimportantly not to overspend my\nbudget. Bands of the ilk of Dire\nStraits etc charge fees in excess of\n\u00a3100,000, if you're lucky, a figure 32\ntimes my budget. Personally I don't think Ian should make high fantastic al statements about a subject which he\nknows little, especially without\nconsulting the Ents Officer.\"\nFELIX Monday October 5th19873 "

    "content": "La Bamba\nA FILM about music, love, success\nand sorrow. It portrays the 8 month\nrise to stardom of Ritchie Valens (Lou\nDiamond Phillips), one of the three\nrock and roll stars to tragically die in\nthe plane crash which killed Buddy\nHolly and inspired Don McLean's American Pie.\nUnfortunately, unlike American Pie\nthe film does not live up to the\npotential of the history behind it, nor\ndoes it do real justice to the many rock\nand roll stars whose music is re in acted within it. The whole film seemed to\nlack a feeling of realism which is\nexceptionally sad as it is a true story.\nTacky production, unimaginative\ncamera shots and poorly picked props\n(including a1980s guitar in a1950s set) all let down what could have been\na very good story.\nOne performance of note is Esai\nMorales (Bob Morales) who plays\nValen's rebel half-br of her. Inevitably,\nMorales is involved in the more subtle\nand striking parts of the film although\nit must be said that his part did hold\na resemblance to a1950s version of\nPrince in Purple Rain. All this aside\nit must be said that it was fun, I found\nmyself singing as I left and must\nadmit I shed a tear at the point when\nValen's death is heard over the radio.\nIt is worth seeing if only for the\nbeauty of the story.\nAs Don McLean said,\n' 7 can't remember if I cried,\nwhen I heard about his widowed bride,\nbut something touched me deep inside,\nthe day the music died. \" /,//.\nFull Metal Jacket\nStanley Kubrick's latest production\nfollows such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork\nOrange. It is another attempt to\nexpose the reality behind America's self-conscious war in Vietnam. The\nquestion still remains though: can any\nsingle film successfully convey all\npoints of view? This is surely an\nimpossible task, yet Kubrick rises to\nthe challenge admirably.\nAdapted from Gustav Hasford's The Short Timers the film is neatly\nsplit in two. Firstly we are taken\nthrough rigorous basic training.\nDespite repetitive drills and iron\ndiscipline the various characters\ndevelop, each coping in their own\nway. Bullying and victim is ation are\ninevitable, with dramatic results.\nRecruits, affectionately known as\n'maggots', pray nightly to their rifles\nas they are gradually turned into\n'killing machines'.\nIn the second part we focus on the\nfortunes of Private 'Joker' (Matthew\nModine) as a field reporter on the\nStars and Stripes, a morale boosting\nrag for the grunts. Following the\nbattle for Hue city, the climax of the\n1968 Tet offensive, Joker opts for\naction in the front line over the\nrelative safety of the rear.\nKubrick's transformation of the\nDocklands into a Vietnam war zone\nin never wholly convincing, but here\nlies the turning point of the film as\nthe characters are forced to accept\ntheir hopeless position. A dramatic\nencounter with a sniper brings home\nthe tragedy and cost of war in human\nterms.\nUltimately a thoughtful and\nintelligent production\u2014the very\nantithesis of Rambo\u2014the film remains\na clinical, if very worthwhile,\ndocument. A.N. The Big Easy\nSET IN New Orleans, The Big Easy\nis a familiar story of drug barons,\npolice corruption and gumbo. Based\non the tried and tested Tracy/Hepburn\nstyle of romance, it tells the tale of\nRemy McSwain (Dennis Quaid),\nhomicide chief in the New Orleans\npolice department who is\ninvestigating a gangland drug war.\nAmidst the killings of rival gangs\nAssistant District Attouniey Ann Osborne (Ellen Barkin) arrives to\ninvestigate police corruption.\nInevitably the two plots fall neatly if\nsomewhat predictably together.\nAt times the Big Easy (a colloquial\nterm for New Orleans itself) seems\nmore like a high budget pilot for a television series a la Moonlighting,\nbut thankfully refrains from being\nover sentimental. There are some nice\ntouches of humour notably Ms Osborne's introduction to McSwain's younger brother.\nThe New Orleans setting with its\nlaid back lifestyle makes a refreshing\nchange from the usual New York/California cop movies, and at\ntimes the scenery is breathtaking..\nNothing new, but enjoyable all the\nsame.

    "content": "News Feature THE FIFTH COLUMN If you take an underground train from\nLeopoldplatz in West Berlin and head\ntowards Alt-Mariendorf, you might\nbe surprised to see armed guards\npatrolling a string of derelict stations\nas the train drives slowly by. At one\nof the stations, known as Friedrich\nStrasse the train will stop and looking\nout onto the platform you might notice\na number of duty free shops. Four\npassport checks later and you could\nbe enjoying a surprisingly cheap\nshopping spree in East Berlin (if you\ndon't mind queueing that is).\nTo the citizens of Berlin the\ndivision between the Eastern and\nWestern halves of the city is a fact of\nlife. The Berlin wall for the most part\ngoes unnoticed except by fascinated\ntourists. Yet it remains a symbol of\nthe tremendous political and\neconomic division between the\nCommunist East and the Conservative\nWest. To the Federal Republic of\nGermany (FDR), the wall is a barrier\ndesigned to keep the East Germans in.\nFor the Democratic Republic (FDR),\nthe wall is an 'Anti-Fascist Protection\nBarrier', designed to keep the West\nGermans out.\nSince its construction in 1961 the\nwall has progressed through four\ngenerations. Starting life as a barbed\nwire barricade it developed into a crude breeze block wall, before\nreaching its current incarnation\u2014a prefabricated concrete structure some\n111km in length. As the years\nprogressed defences along the wall\nwere gradually improved with the aim\nof reducing the steady trickle of East\nGermans defecting to the West. A 'death strip' containing alarms, trip\nwires and bunkers was established.\nDog runs and anti-vehicle ditches\nwere constructed and 295 watch\ntowers were erected. Until 1982 when\nthey were removed because of\ninternational protests, the death strip\ncontained 54,\u20ac00 shrapnel firing\ndevices. These devices, each packed\nwith explosive were triggered by a series of trip wires and launched 110\nsteel cubes in the general direction of\nthe victim. The injuries produced by\nthe shrapnel were invariably horrific\nand at least eleven people are known\nto have died because of these\nmachines.\nThe political climate which led to\nthe construction of the wall has its\norigins in recent history.\nNineteen eighty-seven is a historic year for Berlin. In the midst of the\ncity's? S0tfe anniversary celebrations, and for tine first time since the\ndivision of the country after the war. the East German leader Erich\nHonmtker has been of fl daM? received by the West German ChaaceSor.\nDuring a week of negotiations, Mr Homseeker gave assurances that\nEast Germany would relax its restrictions on travel to the West.\n\"The day will come when the borders will not separate as but unite\nus, as the border between the DDR ami Poland unites\" be said.\nChancellor Hold's response was cool and guarded as be reminded\nbis audience that Socialism and Capitalism were as separate as fire\nSignificantly both politician's speeches were gives unedited TV and\nnewspaper coverage in the East. Yet in spite of the concessions offered\nby both sides it seems unlikely that Boon Is any closer to its dream\nof a united Germany. The fact that Mr Bonneckcr\u2014until no*\nunrecognised by the FDR\u2014was received at all underlines the division\nbetween the two Germasies. The German Press are also sceptical. Mr\nHonnecker's desire that the East-West border should one day em ami ate the \"peace boundary' between Poland and the DDR is less optimistic\ntb an it appears, according to Stern magazine. Ever since the uprising\nof the Solidarity Trade Union, travel between the DDR and Poland\nhas been heavily restricted and immigrants are expected to prove, to\nthe satisfaction of the police, that they save bees invited into the\ncountry. The border itself is marked by a meter high fence equipped\nwith observation towers and warning signs which state \"Stop. State\nboundary\nThe fate of Germany after the\nSecond WorldWar had been\ndetermined by the Foreign Ministers\nConference, held in Moscow in 1943.\nGermany was to be divided into\noccupation zones controlled by the\nBritish, Russians and Americans.\nWhen France was later given a share\nin the division, it became apparent\nthat Berlin would be left stranded\nwithin the Russian zone.\nIt was agreed that the city itself\nwould also be divided into occupation\nzones and governed jointly by the\nAllied commandants. Although it was\ndecided to establish three air corridors\nthrough the Russian zone, for the\nmost part reliance was placed on\nAllied goodwill for the rights of\npassage to Berlin. This, as it was to\nturn out was the Western Allies' first\nmistake.\nOn June 24th1948 the Russians\nclosed off the road and rail links\nbetween Berlin and West Germany.\nTheir intention\u2014to cut off West\nBerlin's food supply and win the\neconomic battle by offering cheap\nEast German supplies to the West\nBerliners. The Allies responded with\nan airlift on a massive scale. For ten\nmonths aircraft landed in Berlin's main airports at ninety second\nintervals to supply the city with the\n12,000 tons of goods it required each\nday. Meanwhile the West Berliners\nstoically resisted the offers of cut\nprice food from the East.\nBy May 1941 the Russians had\naccepted defeat and the blockade was\nlifted. Because of labour shortages in\nthe Western half of the city a large\nnumber of East Germans commuted\nfrom East Berlin. To the\nem baras s ment of the newly\nrecognised German Democratic\nRepublic (DDR) the border crosser s, known as the Grenzganger, were paid\nin D Marks and were thus able to\nenjoy cheap rents in the East whilst\nstill being able to purchase luxury\nWestern goods. Things came to a head in 1953 when the Kremlin\nordered the establishment of 'Collective Farms'. Soon afterwards\nfood supplies in the East dwindled and\na steady stream of refugees began to\nleave for the West. The combined\neffects of food shortages and demands\nfor a10% increase in workers'\nproductivity sparked a general strike\nin July of that year. Throughout the\nDDR the strikers demanded free\nelections and the resignation of the\nGovernment. Soviet troops managed\nto quell the demonstrations, though\nthree hundred people were killed and\nthousands injured in the process.\nThe increasing unrest led to more\nand more refugees crossing the\nborder. In an effort to put a stop to\nthis the DDR placed fortifications\nalong the border between East and\nWest Germany. Berlin, however,\nremained unrestricted and by 1961\ntwo thousand refugees were arriving\nin reception centers in the Western\nhalf of the city each day.\nAmid increasing tension the head\nof the East German Socialist Unity\nParty (SED), Walter Ul b rich, reassured the West that 'nobody had\nany intention of building a wall'. Less\nthan a month later, under the auspices\nof the Secretary for National Security,\nErich Honecker, twenty thousand\ntroops of the New People's Army\nentered Berlin. Under the cover of\ndarkness, coils of barbed wire were\nplaced over the crossing points\nbetween East and West and the\ninterconnecting roads were dug up,\nunderground stations were padlocked\nand guards were placed at strategic\npoints. The wall had arrived.\nFamilies and friends were separated\novernight, workers and managers\nwere unable to turn up to work and\nthe lecture theatres in Berlin's university were half empty.\nIt was therefore left to the\nindividuals affected to cope as best\nthey could; ever since the first strands\nof barbed wire were laid there had\nbeen a steady trickle of refugees\nescaping over, under or through the\nwall. In the early days, wall hopping\nwas relatively easy and often took\nplace on the spur of the moment. A number of East German guards\nsimply lifted up the barbed wire and\nwalked to freedom in the West.\nOthers swam across the canals which\nmarked the East-West border or\nstrapped themselves to the underside\nof Western bound trains.

    "content": "News UPDATE\nTax probe:\nRefectories cook the books\nAN INVESTIGATION by the Inland\nRevenue could cost IC more than\n\u00a3100,000 in unpaid tax. The problem\nhas arisen because of the Refectories\nSection's fail iure to pay tax and\nNational Insurance for casual\nworkers. It is likely that the cost will\nhave to be covered by price increases\nin refectories and bars.\nThe College is claiming that the\nworkers are self-employed and are\ntherefore responsible for their own tax\nand National Insurance. If the Inland\nRevenue does not accept this claim,\nCollege may have to pay up to seven\nyears' tax.\nAlthough Refectories will be the\nhardest hit, other parts of the College,\nincluding the Union Bar, are also\nunder scrutiny. This is not expected\nto reveal any major problems, since\nthey keep better records of casual\nlabour. The Holland Club may be also\ninvestigated.\nA spokesman from the Finance\nSection said that there had been\nefforts to reform the system and that\npeople who undertook a lot of casual\nwork were put onto the payroll. He\nadmitted that the investigation had\ntaken the College by surprise and that\nit was causing the administration\nsome concern.\nIf the College is faced with a large\nbill, it may consider suing the\nauditors, who have passed the College\naccounts every year.\nThe Special Office of the Inland\nRevenue carried out a check of the\nCollege's books about two years ago,\nas part of a general investigation into\nuniversity finance. The check did not\nresult in any further action against the\nCollege. The current investigation is\nbeing undertaken by the Inland\nRevenue's local office and was\nprompted by a DHSS check on part\ntime College workers who were also\nclaiming the dole.\nBoat Club victory\nBOAT CLUB'S1 st IV won the\nprestigious Henley Regatta Challenge\nCup, beating top university and\ncollege teams and cutting six seconds\nfrom the course record in the process.\nDue to the Club's Henley success,\nseveral members were selected to\nrepresent the Britain in international\ncompetitions, including the World\nStudent Games and the World\nChampionships. Nicholas Burfitt,\nwho was selected for the World\nChampionships, also has hopes of\nrowing in next year's Olympic\nGames.\nCheap Beer\nIMPERIAL College's beer supplies\nare to be controlled centrally by the\nUnion, following discussions between\nthe Refectories Manager, Holland\nClub Manager and ICU Deputy\nPresident. The idea of a combined\nbeer order was suggested last year by\nRob Northey, the Refectories\nManager. Both the College and the\nUnion stand to make substantial\nsavings from the increased barrel l age discount and if St Mary's Medical\nSchool choose to join the new system,\nthe order will be the largest in\nLondon.\nCollege puts students on the streets\nTEN students who had been allocated\nCollege accommodation over the\nSummer were given only three days\nnotice that their bookings had been\ncancelled. The problem was caused\nby overbooking of rooms in the\nSummer Accommodation Centre.\nThe students were not on academic\ncourses and six of them were\nsubsequently offered alternative\naccommodation. De-allocation was\nnecessary to accommodate\npostgraduates who were guaranteed\none year in hall.\nMost rooms had to be vacated by\n10am on Saturday 27th June so that\nconference guests could move in on\nthe following Monday. This was to\nallow time for the rooms to be\nthoroughly cleaned.\nOne student called the weekend as\na\"gin or mou s farce\". He described\nstudents who got up at six o 'clock to\npack and parents who drove from two\no 'clock in the morning in order to\nbeat the deadline. Southside looked\nlike a refugee camp, he added.\nAfter rumours that College\nAssistant Secretary Michael Arthur\nhad made the decision that students\nhad to leave on Saturday, anonymous\nnotices appeared around Southside.\nThe notices claimed that\naccommodation was available and\ngave what was in fact Mr Arthur's home number. He later stated that the\nrumours were \"not in the slightest bit\ntrue\" and said that he had received\n\"one or two\" calls.\nNUS boycott SA\nscholarships\nSTUDENTS are being dissuaded\nfrom accepting scholarships from\nIBM, Shell and Plessey, due to their\nSouth African links, in the latest NUS anti-apartheid campaign. They are\nalso putting pressure on students not\nto work in South Africa and are\nasking unions to stop buying Shell\nPetrol for their minibuses. This new\ninitiative follows the success of the\nBarclays campaign last year, which\nforced them to withdraw after an\nestimated loss of \u00a336m student\ndeposits.\nHamlet trashed\nRESIDENTS in Hamlet Gardens\nSummer Letting Scheme were evicted\nhaving caused \u00a31,000 worth of\ndamage.\nNeighbours had complained about\nbottles being thrown out of windows\nand excessive noise. The residents\nwere also falling behind with their\nrent and they were even tully asked to\nleave. They decided to become-squatters, but left of their own accord\nwhen their possessions were removed\nby the managers. Inspection of the flat\nrevealed that the cooker had been\ntaken. Manager Symon Corns later\napprehended two intruders,\npreventing them from entering the\nflat.\nExpedition\ncancelled\nTHE MOUNTAINEERING Club's Karakoram expedition was called off\ndue to illness. Some members of the\nteam had already arrived at Karachi\nand were making final preparations\nfor the ascent, when one of them\nbecame ill and had to be flown back\nto Britain. Expedition leader Jerry\nHasnip decided to cancel the rest of\nthe trip.\nPrayer Room\nTHE ISLAMIC Prayer Room in the\nbasement of Princes Gardens is being\nextended after money was raised from\nthe Kensington Committee of Friendship for Overseas Students and\nImperial College Union. This will\nallow an extra 40 students to pray at\nany one time and provides additional\nwashing facilities.\nFELIX Monday October 5th19877 "
