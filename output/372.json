    "content": "FELIX SPORT\nMORPHY RUSBV\nRACES'74 The traditions! 3 races\nbetween constituent colleges\n(Morphy, Lowry *i Rugby 8'sl\nhad an addition this, the\nwomen's fours. This is due 1\n0\nIC women's enthusiasm in\nforming a 'Women's Boat Club'\nsince Morphy day last year.\nThey rowed for the Flowers\nCup (surprisingly enough\nawarded by Lady Flowers).\nThe first race was the\nLowry race, rowed from the\nMile Post to the University\nStone (1 mile). Guilds' steadily\ngained water at the beginning\nof the race RCS were about\n!6 length down until someone\ncaught a crab and they were\n5 lenght s down. Guilds' kept\nthis lead, and took it easy\n(Simon Baker stroking well\nbelow 30) through the finish.\nMines followed 2 leng his behind RCS.\nThe official umpire managed\nto arrive in time for the next\nrace, the women's restricted\nfours. This race was more\ninteresting as the crews were\nmuch more evenly matched.\nAfter a somewhat controversial\nstart Mines were in the lead.\nROS had about \" 2 length on\nGuilds but before half way\n(i ui lds overtook them, but then\nfailed to take advantage of the\nstream. Mines won by a convincing 3 lengths and although\nthey had a slight advantage at\nthe start they rowed well\n(especially since two of them\nhardly rowed before).\nAs soon as the Lowry\nCrews left their boats, the\nRugby 8's took their place.\nThey had virtually no experience (the cox was supposed\nto have some for safety's sake)\nthe crew zigzagged their way\nslowly past the fight, up to\nFulham Football Stadium. One\nguy smashed his finger on the\nside of the boat and the crew\nstopped at the bank to let a stinking polythene sack row in\nhis place. The race was short\n(1200m) but dramatic. Guilds\nstarted way out of the stream\nbut their cox played well and\naimed straight for the other\ncrews. By half wah cox es were\nscreaming obscenities through\nthe flying spray and sweat.\nTension was mounting as- the\ncrews drew closer and closer\ntogether, the blades were\nmissing by millimeters,\nCharlie (the boatmen) was\ncringing. But Guilds' Cheni.\nl. ng. Rent-a C'rew were increasing their half length lead\nall the time. Past the boat house Guilds glided at Charlie\nWrigley's Sunday Afternoon\nrating while lesser mortals\nsplashed behind. But then the\nother crews made a comeback,\nat every stroke Guilds were\nlosing water. Paul (whatever\nyou do, don't panic) OTIara\nwas panicking, Charlie (can't get the f 'ing thing out) Wingley\nhad most definitely lost his\ncool. But with 10 gigantic-strokes Rent-a Crew nearly\ncapsized the boat and won the\nrace by over a length. Mines\nand RCS lost (well, you ought\nto write your own article).\nThe Morphy Race (1st8's) followed later. Although\nGuild's had to substitute one\nof their Lub.Lab.internationals\n(Tim Crookes) at the last\nminute, it was still expected\nthey would win.\nAt the start of the race\nGuilds were in fact, slightly\ndown on RCS. But when (i ui lds passed Mines (who had the\nstream), Pete Hughes steered\nthem (successfully cutting up\nMines) into the fast water.\nWith this advantage Guilds\ntook 3 or 4 lengths. No Sweat.\nPast the boat house it looked\nas though Mines * RCS were\nneck and neck but it was an\nillusion since RCS came in\nsecond with a length of clear\nwater over Mines. (Never mind\nMines, at least you didn't have\nto stop and row backwards this\nyear).\nThe man at the finishing\npost was Haydn Thomas\n(Guilds) so don't blame me.\nWinning crews:\u2014\nLowry: J. Wilkinson, P. Tomkins\nT. Lancaster, M. Hill, M. Downey\nJ. Fitzgerald, S. Baker,\\4.Jones.\nWomens: Helen Natrass. Julia\nplus 3 others.\nRugby: S. Hoyle, T. Hanson,\nR. Jones, R. Sutton, P.

Winglev,\nP.O 'Hara (Cox).\nAfter the grounding of the\nnew style IC team the previous\nSaturday the same side was\ngiven the chance to shine in\nthe first round of the (iut te ridge Cup. Despite the visit of the\nLondon fire brigade to Harlington the game took place on\na pitch which was in s uprising ly good condition.\nFor the first time this season\nIC were unfortunate enough to\nlose the toss but this did not\nstop IC from playing in the\nopposite direction to normal.\nThe match started on a fairly even basis with QF.C tackling the IC players with\ngreat spirit. Nearh . all the\nearly pressure was from IC,\nhowever, but we were reward ei only by a( rank Forbes penalty\nafter about twenty minutes. The\nmuch bigger IC players were\nbound to come out on top\neventually and soon after this\npenalty the muscle did, in fact\npay off. For the first time this\nseason the tea and biscuits\nbrigade supplied some quick\nloose possession and the backs\nwere not slow to capital is e. 'The Prisoner\", at outside,\nhalf supplied quick ball to the\ncentres and the Frog entered\nthe line with excellent timing,\nthe result of these manoeuvres\nbeing the creation of a great\nnumber of overlaps.\nA few strange faces turned\nup in the lower lounge last\nSaturday which meant that\n2 late comers for the A's and 2\nfor the extra's did not get\ngames. The Hxtra Ist's went to\nHarlington for a return match\nwith Belsize Park, who beat\nus earlier this season (I'm sure it has nothing to do with\nthe fact that I wasn't playing).\nThe game started at a fast\npace which never lowered and\nitis some surprise that D. Turner\nkept going. The Hxtra's scored'\nearly on by a try from G. Patterson which M. Spencer\nconverted and then Spencer\ndropped a goal to give u'sa90 lead arid the possibility in\nour minds that we were going\nto walk away with the game.\nHowever, after A. Clapham (he\nput footwear on for the game)\nlaid out one of the opposition\nthings started to swing away\nfrom us and Belsize scored\n(\u00a3-4). After an interception by\nC.(I haven't scored this\nseason) Whiteley, T. Fearn\nscored to> give us a134 lead\nwhich Beisize took from us and\nleft the half-time score as\nA succession of tries were\nrun in the last twenty minutes\nwith the wings Zappa Williams\nand Bo Bo Furter both running\nwell, the fon ner scoring the\nodd try. Mitch Hinstien also\nscored a good try after a peel\nwhich was superbly taken by\nfrank Pants. The hall time\nscore was 23-0.\nThe second half saw the\nconsolidation of the IC dominance and several more tries\nwere scored. The line\ncontinued to move well bu; the\nodd tea cup was seen 10 be\nsecreted in some of the\nforwards belly buttons. Tries\nwere scored by Bo Bo Hurler,\nMitch Hinstien and Frank\nPants (2) and 'The Prisoner'\nconverted some.\nAn all round good performance was given by the\nplayers and spectators both\nduring and after the match.\nAfter our visit to F.ar ls Court\nflights to Australia were\nbooked up for the next six\nmonths. The star of the show\nmust have been 'Mad' Mitch\nHinstien.\nTeam: F. Rog, Z. Williams,\nF. Gilbert, F. Stern, B. Furter.\nP.F Forbes, I'. Harn, I. Pants,\nF. Austin, F.f api' i r.f. Booth,\nF. Lipscombe, /\u2022\"*, M. Finsiien,\nF. Smith.\n(13-18).\nPlaying against the conditions the Hxtra's made the\nbetter of the halves and\nT. Fearn put us within sight of\nvictory again with a50 yd run\nto make the score (17-18). At\nthis the extra's pulled out the\nslops and the game livened up.\nAfter some excellent backing\nup play by the whole side,\nS. Churdy went over to put IC\nin the lead, M. Spencer converting to make it 23-18. The\nlast 10 minutes were tense\nwith Belsize trying to retake\nthe game and the extra's trying\nto make sure of the game.\nFinally J. Rose, working a scissors with M. Spencer, went\nover with half the team at his\nshoulders to clinch the game\nwith a final score of 27-18.\nTeam: D. Turner. Ned, J. Rose,\nG. Patterson, C.

    "content": "mix s Jeff Lewis Michael Austin: Organ Music of KargElert (Polydor).\nSIEGFRIED KARG-ELERT (1879-1933), although a German by birth, was a composer of extreme popularity in England\nand the United States during the early\npart of this century. After his death his\nmusic appears to have been deserted by\nits erstwhile advocates and it consequently became submerged into the almost\nun plumb able depths of musical oblivion:\na far cry indeed from the Karg-Elert\nFestival held in London at the church of\nSt. Lawrence Jewry in May, 1930, which\nled to the foundation of the Organ Music\nSociety in February, 1931.\nThe most interesting piece, Kaleidoscope (Opus 144), starts off an amazing\nmixture of rhythmical quirks and nuances\nwhich establish the work as one of\ncontinually changing mood.\nUndoubtedly Karg-Elett was an assiduous experimenter as regards the\nversatility of an organ and this record is\na fair representation of his highly\nimpressionistic results.\nAnthony Rolfe Johnson: Vaughn\nWilliam's settings of 'The House of\nLife' and 'Songs of Travel'. (Select)\nI HAVE never gone a bundle on music\nwritten for tenor and piano, but for\nVaughn Williams, I'm prepared to make an\nexception \u2014 and a well-deserved exception\nit is too.\nBoth these song-cycles were written\nin 1904 at a time when VW was busy\nlecturing, teaching, collecting folk songs\nand contributing to Grove's Dictionary of\nMusic and Musicians.\nThere is a sensuous imagery about\nThe House of Life which overflows with\nheartfelt beauty. The songs tell of loves\nlost and found plus other associated\nromantic ideas. Perhaps 'Silent Noon' is\nan exception, however, for the people in\nit are portrayed not as tapestry figures\nbut as real people.\nSongs of Travel, in contrast, are\nhighly impressionistic pieces which\nclearly remind one that Vaughn Williams\nonce studied under Ravel in Paris. 'The\nInfinite Shining Heavens' is a perfect\nexample with major sixth and seventh\nspread chords abounding.\nTo all VW fans, (especially since\nthis is the world premier recording of\nThe House of Life), I thoroughly\nrecommend this record.\nJohn Purcell & the Cathedral Strings:\nThe World's Most Beautiful Music\n(Super)\nA RECORD definitely aimed at the\nmass market: those who enjoy superficial,\n'easy listening' music. Now by no means\nis the music itself on this record super-fic i al; it is just that it is scarcely\nrecognisable under the sugar-coating of\nmessy re-orchestrations indulging in the\nsickly sma lU of overripe strings.\nThe worst atrocity is inflicted on\nBach's Sheep May Safely Graze, The\nopening Recitativo is sacrilegious ly omitted and Bach's intimate thirds which\nwould normally dance so crisply over the\nsublime middle texture are blandly\nJames Wilkinson sm armed into something coming from\nMantovani on one of his off days. Give it\nto your a untie for Christmas\nTONTO: It's About Time (Polydor).\nIT HAS been three years since the\nfirst TONTO ('The Original New Timbral\nOrchestra') album Zero Time, exceeded\nall expectations by selling 20,000 copies.\nBut now the much improved computer-synthesis er Ms back with lbs best\nsynthesised music around at the moment.\nHaving added a digital memory and\ncontrol unit to the basic aggregate of\nMOOG and ARP synthesis er components,\nthe two men behind it alI, Robert Margouleff\n(a singer with the Boston Symphony\nOrchestra) and Malcolm Cecil (a bassist\nfrom the BBC Orchestra) have improved\nthe stability of the voltage-controlled\noscillators (used to generate pitch), and\nare now able to operate several synthesisers at the same time. Also by pre-programming the digital memory and\ncontrol unit, the number of voltage\nfunctions that can be controlled simultaneously is increased so that attention\ncan be devoted to other controls.\nThe music itself is by no stretch of\nthe imagination a dull vehicle by which\nthe versatility of the electronics can be\nexplored. 'Beautiful You' stands out as a classic in the style of a steel band and\n'The Pyramid Suite '\u2014 The Pharoah's Journey from Death to Life' evokes an\nintense feeling of mysticism and dark\nd is gui et. Buy this record and you certainly\nwon't regret it.\nBOOKS\nPaul Kocher: Master of Middle Earth\nSUBTITLED 'The Achievement of\nJRR Tolkien', this book sets out to\nenlighten its readers on possible ideas,\nthe thoughts, and the philosophy of the\ncelebrated author of the 'Lord of the\nRings'. Not surprisingly an in depth\nsurvey of the ring trilogy takes up most of\nthe book. As I enjoyed the 'Lord of the\nRings' I found this book opened up fresh\nideas and insights into its themes.\nPaul Kocher sets out to dispel the\nsuggestion that the ring trilogy is directly\nallegorical while maintaining there is\nrelevance to be found in it. Part of this\nis his demonstration of Tolkien's hate\nof our mechanistic society and feeling of\nour alienation from nature. Individual\nsections contain discussions on 'The\nHobbit'. Sauron and the Nature of Evil,\nElves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Ents and Men.\nAragorn also receives a full chapter's discussion on his character and role in\n'The Lord of the Rings'.\nTolkien's other main works are also\nexamined: stories and poems. Again\nhighlighted is Tolkien's concern for our\nalienation with the 'realm of f aery', and\nwhether a writer can contribute in any\nreal manner to reverse this trend.\nAll in all, a book that I found entertaining and would recommend to any\nTolkien admirer. It would certainly\ninspire re-reading of 'Lord of the Rings'\nwith fresh insight. It also interested me\nin his other works. To those who have\nnot read Tolkien I have one word:\u2014\n'Do!' - then buy this book.\nPakistan Society Imperial College\npresents\nA Musical Variety Programme\nFeaturing: Mohammed Kassim & Party\nand several other weil known BBC Radio and TV Asian artists\non Saturday 4th January, 1975 at 8.00p.m.( sharp) in the\nGreat Hall, College Block, Exhibition Road SW7\nAdmission: 50p Tickets From: Ram (Internal 2707)\nI.C.P.

    "content": "ft KC Of tMS Jack Llewellyn Hues Corporation: Rockin' Soul (RCA)\nWORDS SEEM almost . inappropriate\nwhen trying to describe the latest album\nfrom the Incredible Hues Corporation,\nfeaturing two of the biggest soul hits of\nthe year - the title track 'Rockin' Soul'\nand the unforgettable 'Rock the Boat'.\nThe kind of soul that this trio produce\njust bursts with an increasingly insistent\noptimism which cannot be ignored. Track\nafter track just pours out, each sporting\nthe stamp of quality, but it just does\nseem after a while that the formula used\nto create these arrangements is perhaps\nfalling into the trap of becoming a little\ninflexible. A driving beat, a strong\nmelody and a catchy rhythm are OK, but\nnot all the time. Definitely worth buying\nthough.\nJefferson Starship: Dragon Fly (Grunt)\nALTHOUGH THIS is the fourth album\nproduced by the various musicians who.\nin one way or another, have evolved from\nthe original Jefferson Airplane, it is,\nnevertheless, their first as a self contained unit featuring all seven members.\nI never really went in for the Airplane's lyrics very much \u2014 melodies always\nseemed to be their strong point, but there\nare two tracks 'Be Young You' and 'All\nFly Away' which have instantly shattered\nthose illusions. The former is essentially\na medium pace ballad for piano, electric\nviolin and the voice of Grace Slick. The\nlyrics take a lot of beating. The latter,\nhowever, does just that: from a slow,\nmoody, almost metaphysical beginning,\nthe song grows in lyrical strength and for\nme is the highlight of the album. Although\nthe 'Starship' was originally the brainchild of Paul Kantner as a means of\nexpressing his musical ideas outside the\nband, it has now materialise d as something as high-powered as the 'Airplane'\nused tc be.\nDefinitely an album not to be missed.\nLindisfarne: Happy Daze (Warner Bros)\nTHIS ALBUM shows exactly what\nLindisfarne are capable of when they\nreally get down to it. All their lyrical and\nmelodic strength is here, tightly strung\nagainst a background of crisp acoustic\nguitars all of which adds up to superb\nmusic.\nUndoubtedly the best track for me is\n'River', a ballad of lyrical beauty'which\nis very introspective in nature. It shows a maturity in composition which is so often\nlacking in many of the current 'pop'\ngroups of today.\nAnother one surely destined for\nrecognition as a Lindisfarne classic is\nthe final track of the album: 'Tomorrow'.\nIt's a melancholy number where the\nsinger pictures himself as a loser, a drop-out who is oppressed by society and\nis condemned to 'wake and carry on\ntomorrow'.\nSad really. Get it.\nRichard Warm Jo Jo Gunne: So Where's The Show\n(Asylum SYL 9019)\nJo Jo Gunne were formed in '71 and\nhad a hit soon after entitled 'Run, Run,\nRun'. Since then they have changed their\nline up a couple of times before coming\nout with this album. According to the\nbump f sheet: \" 'Show where's the show'\nagain focuses on Jo Jo's tight, direct\nrock 'n' roll attack. But studio experimentation has been minimise d and the\nband feel that the record's great strength\nis its economy\". Well that seems a pretty\nfair summary.\nThe album is competent rock 'n' roll\non the heavy side 'Jo Jo Gunne are the\nshow \u2014 b once 'breakers supreme!'. So if\nyou like heavy rock maybe this album's for you. Personally I filed it away to the\nback of the drawer lab led boredom (but I file Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath there\nas well).\n'Where is the Show?' the first track\nhas been released as a single and might\nstand a chance, there's a continuous beat\nand some good guitar work not to mention\nnot to much repetition of the lyrics. The\nrest of the tracks are OK but contain\nnothing to even slightly jar a rock\nignore r like me out of a lethargic d warm. For me, not a significant album.\nJackson Browne: Late for the Sky\n(Asylum SYL 9018)\nJACKSON BROWNE puts most of the\nemphasis on his voice with his piano\nplaying often lost in the pleasant but\nunobtrusive background. The easy ballad\nstyle is maintained consistently in all\nbut one. track on the album.\nThe'album kicks off pleasantly but in\nlow gear with 'Lafe for the Sky'. This\ntitle is the first sign of what seems to be\nsome sort of obsession on Jackson's part\nwith the sky, though was kept in suspense\nas to what the title had to do with the\nsong until the last tune. Next a very nice\ntrack entitled 'Fountain of Sorrow',\n'Farther On' and 'The Late Show' complete the first side of the album.\n'The Road and the Sky' (see what I mean) opens up the second side_ of the\nalbum. This is the outstanding track on\nthe album not only by its quality but its\nchange in pace. 'For a Dancer' is the\nsecond track which (you guessed it) also\ncontains several references to the sky.\nI didn't like the next track 'Walking Slow',\nI found the lyrics silly in places, witness:\n'I'm putting down my left foot....I'm putting down my right foot'. The album is\nclosed by 'Before the Deluge' which has\nagain pleasant thought, in this case, more\nmeaningful lyrics.\nQuite a pleasant album \u2014 a good buy\nif you like easy ballads.\nTony Preston Bachman Turner Overdrive: Not\nFragile (Mercury 9100007)\nBachman Turner Overdrive are big\nname in America but as yet have failed\nto create the same impression here. This\ntheir third album opens with real\nmachine gun playing from Randy Bachman\nand Blair Thornton on the title track.\nThe song breaks in the middle to allow\nthe drums' and bass to set the rhythm\nwhilst the lead guitars gradually come\nin weaving their way round the beat\nbefore the punishing finale. The high-spot of the set is the fourth track,\n'You ain't seen nothing yet', which\ncomes as light relief from the earlier\nheavy guitar work. The three guitarists\nplay in close harmony giving a smooth,\ngentle, perfect sound with lines like,\n\"she looked at me with her big brown\neyes and said 'You ain't seen nothing\nyet'\".\nBTO are a very polished group with\nyears of experience showing through\ntheir play. If you are driving somewhere\nfast, this is the album for you. I predict'\nthat BTO will be a big name next year,\nand I was right about 'Bowie' and 'Mott'.\nOne might describe them best as a cross\nbetween 'Deep Purple' and 'Wishbone\nAsh' if that is possible.\nCont. on page 5\n\n"

He is concerned\nthat many clubs and societies\ndo not use his services. He is\nthere to be consulted before\nany party, show, etc. on any\npossible fire risk. He would\nalso be happy to advise\nindividual students on fire\nprevention and precautions\nwhere they live at college.\nWOULD LIKE TO WISH ALL ITS READERS\nA VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3 UGM Report\nA UGM was held on the 5th December at 6.00p.m. in the\nlower Union refectory^\" The first attempt at this new time and\nplace was thought to be a success.\nThe latest 'softening up'\ntechnique used on the sometimes ill-behaved floor\n(remember all the paper dart\nthrowing in the Great Hall) was\nthe showing of three cartoon\nfilms prior to the meeting albeit\none black and white. The\nPresident seemed pleased\nwith the result as he kept\nmuttering loudly 'Good, they\nare behaving themselves' or\nwords to that effect, for the\nfirst part of the meeting.\nThe sorting out of red tape\n(minutes, matters arising,\nquestions, President's report\netc.) was done with amazing\nspeed; the only thing of note\nbeing the ratification of the\nlast set of elections \u2014 two\npublications board members\nand a couple of departmental\nreps. We now came to the\nsubstantive part of the meeting:\nthe motions on policy. The\nfirst opposing the proposal that\n'sixth form students should\npay \u00a32 upon entering the VCCA\nscheme' was carried after some\ndiscussion. The second motion\nwas passed, declaring ICU's opposition to recent cuts in\neducation and their effects\nupon students and the qua if cy of education, this followed an\namendment by Mr. John Lane\nwhich read: 'Since the cuts\nwill mean a worsening of both\nthe conditions of those working\nin College and the quality of\neducation of students, they\nmust be fought in a united way\nby all the unions in IC. ICU\nshould as soon as possible,\ncall a meeting of the JCU\n(consisting of ICU, ASTMS,\nNUPE. AUT) with additional\nrepresentatives from NALGO\nand ICPGG'.\nThis amendment was put in\nplace of the original section 4\nand was accepted by the\nproposer Tom Abraham. The\nmotion was passed with minor\ndeletions.\ni The real bone of contention in the meeting was, of\ncourse, the third motion on\nterrorism proposed by Mr. Kill,\n'This motion noted and believed\nin the need for Mr. Jenkin's BUT. The President (having\npassed the chair to Pete\nTeague) proposed a 'delete\nall. insert all' am mend ment declaring ICU's support of the\nNUS motion and opposing the\naforesaid legislation. The\nPresident'sam mend ment was\ndefeated.\nIn all eleven amendments\n(which took up one and a half\nhours to discuss), in total were\nproposed, which- varied in\nimportance. Several of these\namendments were only passed\nDID YOU KNOW THAT THE REVD. B.K. TE TTE Y,B.A. CHAPLAIN TO GHANAIAN STUDENTS AND NURSES44 CA UTLEY AVENUE LONDON. SW4 9HUT EL:016734831 Would Like To Hear From Ghanaian Students In London? after a show of hands.\nOne of these amendments\nwas, 'ICU instructs the\nHonorary Secretary to write to\nthe National Council of Civil\nLiberties and the national\npress expressing their disgust\nat the NCCL's statement\ncondemning the BUT. At this\nthe President intervened to say\nthat he felt that this amendment would be undermining his\nposition and that it was his\nduty to represent the views of\nIC students regardless of his\nown opinions. He proposed an\namendment to this amended\nmotion which had the words\n'Honorary Secretary' replaced\nby the 'President'. The amendment in this form was overwhelmingly carried.\nA 'move to the vote' cry on\nthis motion (motion 3 \u2014\ndealing with ICU's views on\nAlbert' s Plum(S. Ken. Stn.)\nCut Price 55p3 course meal to\nIC Students\n(Discotheque till 3a.m.) terrorism) was immediately\nfollowed by a challenge to the\nquorum at 8.46p.m. which was\nupheld by Pete Teague who\nwas in the Chair. The meeting\nthen closed with thanks, from\nPete Teague to the members\nof the floor. A meeting of\nImperial College Students was\nnot held as usual due to the\nfact that everyone left\nimmediately the UGM ended.\n[ w \u00a3 TO W5T AN< EY PO \u00a3 T4<E<4ST TIMC Tws\nT0t-MJ^ Ffe\u00abjA/f THe f+ AA/Sove*.

    "content": "READ THE OTHER SIDE FIRST\nDo I qualify for a Grant? Only students following a full-time Higher Education course at a University or College within the U.K. Foreign nationals included subject to evidence that\nthey can remit premiums.\nWhere does the money come from?It is the major part of the commission intrinsic in all assurance\npremiums. Normally this pays salesmen, advertising, etc.; in S. L.A.S.( which now has a large Graduate clientele coming back for further insurances) these costs are minimise d, and the resultant surplus passed back to the individual student. Thus S. L.A.S. helps you\nto create a proper financial security as early as your non-student contemporary who can\nafford to pay premiums out of income.\nHow much will my Grant be? This depends on the policy you take: the present figure* is \u00a315\nfor every \"thousand pound policy\", minimum two thousand (so, min. Grant \u00a330).\nThe maximum is \u00a3150, on ten thousand or over. An average student takes a \u00a34000 whole-life convertible policy where the outlay is about \u00a332 p.a. and the Grant \u00a360.\n(*the rate may vary in future with circumstances: with our Full Details comes a letter quoting the current rate\nand guaranteeing it for proposals completed within 3 months)\nHow is the money paid? We can hand over the money as we receive it, but not in advance:\nnor if you cancel your premiums meanwhile! So the Grant is paid in two/three annual\ninstalments, starting when the policy has been in force 12 months. As soon as the policy\nstarts, we send you a Voucher guaranteeing these repayments.\nWhat Policies qualify for the Grant? Any whole-life or endowment policy with most of the\nleading Companies: and policies preparing for House-Purchase; or to assist Doctors/\nVets/Dentists to purchase their practices; or on the life of your wife or parent; if in doubt,\nask in the space below. But NOT policies of \"term insurance\" because there is no surplus;\nnor policies you have already signed up elsewhere, because the commission has already\nbeen allotted; nor policies commenced after your Final student Term, so if you are in your\nlast year, write at once. (Exception: if you already have aS. L.A.S. policy on the old basis,\nkeep this form and when you want to increase your cover, we will allow the Grant at whatever\nrate is then current).\nWhat is my actual net outlay going to be? This is up to you. You have the whole field of Life\nAssurance, including Unit-linked policies, to choose from; and our Full Details give some\nrecommendations. The popular \"whole-life convertible\" scheme asks, for a \u00a32,000policy, only about \u00a317-18 a year . . . And with a \u00a330 Grant, as you can see, nearly all your early\noutlay is refunded by S. L.A.S. Do please note: the Grant has no strings at all: there are\nno \"extras\" to pay for: the S. L.A.S. service and advice both now and later are entirely\nfree.\nThe S. L.A.S. Grant is a natural outcome of 24 years student concessions by Harrisons of\nCambridge.\n(.the following questions occur to me:\nPiggott Ltd., CwnbridE<r "
