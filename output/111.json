    "content": "2 FELIX JOCK WALLACE\nJock is one of the two Wallaces on\nthe Mines Executive (not to be confused with Brian who is the Secretary).\nHe spent most of his childhood in India\nwith his parents and was educated at\nprep, school and Oundle. At Oundle he\nlearnt among other things to row. They\nmust have taught him pretty well as he\nstroked the first Eight in his first year in College, and in his second he\nwas Captain of I.C. boats.\nTo hi a many accomplishments he has\nrecently added that of being able to\ndrive that prehistoric monster, Clementine; his official chariot. He hopes\nthat he will not be called on to drive\nher when he gets married next summer.\nWhen asked about his likes and dislikes he said, \" I like the Tuba to be\nPLAXSD, and I do not like young ladies\nwho ask me if I am a Minesman\". He\nalso lists \"Hops\" among his dislikes\n( I believe he meant the \"dance\" type\nhop, not the type which i3 fermented. )\nDAVE STEVENS\nThe President of Guilds, known to\nall as Dave, was at the time of being\ninterviewed lying in bed having succumbed to the Lurgi. This was very unfortunate as he v/ as strike n down in the\nmidst of Guilds Fresher's Dinners.\nHe has played squash for I.C. but\nhas given it up thi3 year. It is recollected that towards the end of last\nyear everyone he met was greeted by the\ncry of \"Have you played squash?\" If the\nanswer was in the affirmative then he\nexhorted the subscription from the poor\nunfortunate.\nBo', his official chariot, is causing a little worry at the moment. Will both cylinders be firing when she attempts\nto go to Brighton?. That is the 64,000\nquestion. When, with his coat of many\nstripes, he sits in her it should be\nquite a magnificent sight.\nHe feels that some mention should be\nmade of his fiancee, Judy, whose latest\nclaim to fame is the reclaiming of the\nSpanner at the beginning of the session,\nhaving followed an arduous trail round\nLondon's main line stations.\nTubas played on Sundays, and I.C. men\nwearing jeans, sweaters and gaudy socks\nto College are among his pet dislikes.\nPROFILE UNION EXECUTIVE DEREK BUTTERS\nDerek, who is President of H.C. S. this\nyear, has worked his way up from the\nbottom. Last year he was Hon. Sec. and\na very hard-working one at that. When\nnot busy being President he relaxes playing golf, rather like a more elderly\nPresident. His handicap, when he is cn\nform and hitting the ball straight, is12. If he cannot hit a stationary golf ball straight the writer has difficulty in visual ising Derek getting his hockey\ncolours for R.C.S. He is in the Chemistry department,\nand is lucky in having left the last\nof the exams behind over a year ago.\nHe is doing research at the moment into\nthe behaviour of detonators when heated\nto 200\u00b0 C. According to his latest\nstatement they do not often explode.\n\"Tubas should only be played by\nGerard Hoffnung* were his last words\nas I left. RICHARD GARNETT\nRich, our gay handsome Union Secretary,\ni a going to be in for a heavy time this\nyear.both academically and in the Union.\nThere seems to be more to getting aD.I.C. than he originally thought. However he\nis used to hard work having been Chairman\nOf the Entertainments Committee last year,\nand despite this getting a1st.in Mining.\nWhen he has finished here he hopes to go\nto Canada,where about a year ago he found\ngold lying about in a mine waiting for him to take it. During the last three years he has\nplayed rug ger for various teams in th-College, but he is afraid that he cannot find time this year.\nAmong his dislikes are cliques and\nmen who play tubas at night.\nJENNIFER HEYWOOD\nJennifer, the President of I. C.V/. A. for those who do not know her, is in t third year of her Physics course (her\nfourth year in College). She seems tbe doing some interesting courses at\nthe moment which involve Engineering\nDrawing in the Guilds one afternoon a week, and glass blowing. She says till\nthis is almost certainly her final yea\nhere, which seems to confirm our op in ii that there may be a man looming large\non the horizon.\nIn the line of sport she has represented I.C. W.S.C. at badminton, 3quash, netball, tennis and table tennis, aa\nwell aa leading I.C.A. in that gran*?\nold sport of water throwing. On this\nlatter activity the following state meri waa secured - \" First floor people can\nuse the balcony in safety as long as\nthey act in accordance with our principles. When questioned cn I. C.W. A. policy for this year she said that they intend to\nstay where they are and enjoy their beau-ti ful fish tank.\nAmong her dislikes are men who play\ntubas.\nHave you ever taken a girl out for\nan evening, then taken her home, and\nfound yourself stranded, miles from your\nown bed, with no transport on hand but\nyour feet? From the sad tales that reach\nour ears we gather that this is not an\ninfrequent occurrence. So, in order to\nsave.you time and trouble, to tell where\nyou may or may not go, and how far (geo-graphically speaking), we present the\nLw.\nglobetrotters' guide In this series we shall detail the\na e an s of getting back to I.C. and all points central from those out-lying parts\nin wh i oh women are wont to have their\nhabitat.\nFURZE DOWN S.W.I7 Pursedown Training College is situated one mile from the nearest Underground station, which is Tooting Broadway. The last north-bound train leaves\nat 12:11 a.m., Monday to Saturday.\nAllowing 8 minutes for the mlle(the\nauthor has been known to do it In 7:50)\nand 30 sec a. for the descent to the\nplatform, farewells must be concluded\"\nby 12:02} a.m. The booking clerk is a very decent chap and will probably let you right through, but in order to allow\nfor the train being early, you are advised\nto leave another 30 sees, or to clearance.\nThis train connects with the last Ealing\ntrain from Charing Cross, and will get you\nback to I.C. by 1 o 'clock.\nShould you miss the 12:11, however,\nwe recommend the following course of act-ion. Take the first available south-bound\ntrain to South Wimbledon (4 mins.). Go\nalong Barton Road, opposite the station,\nuntil you reach the Broadway, then turn\nleft. Keep going until you come to Wimbledon station. The total distance is about a mile, for which par is8:30.( It\nla slightly uphill. The author usually\ntakes a taxi). From Wimbledon station\nthere runs a District Line train to Earla\nCourt only at 12:41 a. a., or, failing that, a Southern Region train at 12:51\nthat reaches Waterloo at 1:05. This leaves\n4 minutes in which to nip smartly over\nHUngerford Bridge to oat cha no. 9 'bus\n(which departs from Ludgate Circus at\n1:03). Tads is a very handy little 'bus,\nalthough it doesn't run on Sunday nights.\nInstead there is an extra one at about\n1:30 on Saturday, ao then you can take\nyour time crossing tee bridge.\nAllowing one minute for tickets at\nWimbledon, you therefore need to get\nyour south-bound train at Tooting Broadway at or before 12:39, but on no account catch a later one (since Wimbledon\nla even worse than Tooting to walk back\nfrom). This procedure thus saves you at\nfrom). This procedure thus gains yon a good 20 minutes.\nOn Sunday, the last tra ln s* les ve about aa hour earlier te an on week-days,\nwh i oh role* them out for our purpose.\nHowever, there Is aa all-night 'bus,\nroute no. 287, which runs every nigh)\nof the week EXCEPT SATURDAYS, that amy\nbe of assistance. These \u2022buses stop at\nTooting Broadway at 12:58 and 1:03 a.m. They both go to Charing Cross Underground station, but in opposite directions, so watch it l They arrive at\nCharing Croat at 1:32 and liS S re a ys it,\nlv ely, so there is plenty of time la which to walk up to the Strand a at e*t the 297 'bus at 1:53 to South Eeasiagtoa.\n\n"

    "content": "VIEWPOINT POVERING IN\n\u2022Manners make t.h man', thus says the\nenigmatic statement whose author is lost in the depths of time. Good manners are\nan essential part of the Gods of Conduct\nthat all well-educated persons should\nfollow. The purpose of an University is to educate its members. This does not\nmean just 'getting a degree'. An\nUniversity should not spoon-feed its members, they should be taught to think\nfor themselves, and to follow the examples set by their superiors.\nLet us stop and think for a moment;\nare we doing ourselves, and our Alma\nMater justice; can we hold the job\nwhich has been offered on the strength\nof our degree? Can we represent our\nfirm at conferences and dinners without\nappearing uneducated and ill-mannered?\nManners and education go hand in hand,\none without the other is a rare event;\nnot everyone is fortunate in having been\nto a Public School where in general good\nmanners are a sine qua non, but some\nGrammar Schools also have this facility for imparting manners and bearing. Even\nif you have not had these advantages at school, your presence at an University\nshould enable you to right these wrongs\nas soon as possible. It is the duty of all old lags to set a good example to freshmen. Do you?\nIn the first few weeks of this term\nwe have had many examples of bad behaviour by persons who should have known\nbetter. At the second hop of term, a post-graduate student (now in his fifth year at I.C.) offered to hold open the\ndoor to the upper refectory so that a lady member of the Entertainments Committee could carry a large and heavy tray\nof cups of coffee through. As she was\npassing through, this lout let. go the\ndoor; the coffee, cups, tray and an were\nspilt on the floor. What apologies did this young lady get? Not a word. This\nlong-haired individual had disappeared.\nI suppose at the time he thought this was amusing. We don't. Often when in the Union, you see\nanother member following behind you;\nbeing polite you hold the door open for him, with what result? More often than\nnot-you get no thanks, not even a cursory\n'nod, and the said creature stalks straight\npast you, and, if it is the refectory\ndoor you have held open, the odds are\nthat you will have to join the queue\nbehind him as he is so bad-mannered as\nto make his way in front of you. Would\nyou do this at home in front of your\nguests and friends? I doubt it, for if you did they would not remain your\nfriends for long.\nWhat is the proper dress for a large\ndinner? Lounge suits of course, unless it is formal and dinner suits are called for. At recent fresher s' dinners, it has been\nnoticeable that quite a few people went\nin sports jackets and blazers. I suppose\nthat if these people were invited out to lu noh by the Managing Director of the\nfirm unfortunate enough to employ them,\nthey would go dressed in their same\neveryday attire. Everyone is entitled to drink if he\nwants to, but there is absolutely no\nreason whatsoever why he should make\nhimself unpleasant and objectionable to his fellow men. Nothing is mare repulsive\nthan a drunken man; why is it necessary\nto drink to excess? No reason at all, it is purely a sign of lack of common-sense,\nit does no one any good; and often causes\nsomeone harm or damage. And why must bar\nglasses be smashed for no reason at all; accidents can happen, but in many cases\nit is sheer bad behaviour and an infantile complex which makes these children delight\nin \u2022the sound of breaking glass. In the\nlong run all such damage has to be made\ngood, and the price falls on everyone and\nnot just on the bad-mannered hooligans\nwho caused the damage.\nMake full use of the Union and its facilities, and further your education to the fullest of your ability, and don't leave here as a moronic uneducated ignoramus so that everyone can say 'Oh he's just another of those poor technological\ngraduates who only thinks by his slide\nrule'.\nC01E ON I.C. YOU'HE BEING GOT AT.\nNelson.\nSWITZERLAND\nVictoria Station was assured of a place in history when, on June 23r d.1957,I.C. Hover Crew assembled there\nen route for summer camp at Kandereteg\nin the Bernese Oberlsnd. The party was\nsixteen strong and was well provided\nwith an assortment of tents, ice-axes,\nropes, cramp on s and sundry other items,\nnot to mention well filled ruc sao s, most of wh i oh proved singularly awkward\nto manage on the train journey across Europe, and singular y useless in Switzerland \u2022\nHowever, Kandersteg was reached with the\nparty still whole, the only mishap\nbeing the leaving behind of two members\nof the crew in the middle of France, due\nto an unfortunate misunderstanding\non the length of time that the train stopped in the station. Fortunately\nthey caught up again with the main party\nin Basel.\nArriving at Kandersteg station, the.\nHovers soon had an opportunity of testing\ntheir hiking muscles on the two-mile walk\nto the International Boy Scouts1\nChalet\nlying at the head of the steep-sided Kander\nvalley where they were to camp. The\nchalet was reached without loss of life however, and almost immediately the previously fine weather changed to a torrent i a downpour. This persuaded the crew that\nit was better\u2022to sleep in dry bunks\ninside the chalet than in wet tents out-side, especially as the river flowing\npast the camp-site was dangerously near to\noverflowing. As things turned out, except\nfor an occasional thunderstorm of short\nduration, the weather for the whole of\nthe sixteen day stay was absolutely clear,\nthe sun being at times almost too hot\nfor hiking.\nAfter two days walking in the mountain!\naround the chalet it was unanimously decide\nthat no attempt would be made to rival the I.C. Norwegian and Kar&kora m expeditions in their mountaineering exploits,\nthe normal alpine paths providing quite\nstrenuous enough exercise. However the\nRover crew can now claim that some of\nits members have climbed the Hockenhorn\n(10,000 ft.) by the efforts of their bod le* and the Jungfraujoch (11,000 ft.) by\ntrain.\nOom \u2014i OT>C \u2014 I zm< PRINT IN MOTION\nWe notice that the magazines have disappeared from the upper lounge.\nThey have reappeared in the writing-tor to T.V. fiends the \"Tele-\") room.\nThe reason given for ths change is that\nthe upper lounge was being used ss a bar\nby pe op ls wishing to sip Mooney's Upper\nRefectory coffee when reading. Presumably the carpet has been suffering.\nSo now what was Initially intended\nas a reading room Is T.V., waiting, s nd reading room. Are you as eh lso phr sn loT HERE WE GO AGAIN\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX5 GYMNASIUM\nDear Sir,I am afraid you have made a great\nmistake in publishing the article about the\nGymnasium in the last issue. You do not\nknow all the facts and some of those\nyou state are incorrect,\nSuperficially, it does appear that the i has been a lot of time spent in preparing\nthe Gymnasium. But that is not the whole\nstory.\nIn the beginning there was to be no\nCymnasium.This facility was to be and\nwill be included in Princes Gardens,\ntogether with squash courts, a swimming\npool and other amenities. These should\nappear by 1960.\nThe Gymnasium, as it now stands, was\nintended to be a small hs.ll, an overflow\nfrom the Concert Hall, which you must\nadmit, is needed on large functions.\nWhy it was considered that a small dance\nfloor was more important than a Gymnasium\nwas due possibly to a member having a stronger say in the House Committee at that\ntime.\nFortunately, with great persuasion by\nsame students, It was permitted to convert\nthe small dance floor into a Gymnasium,\nafter it had been completed.\nSo there was the task, of turning an\nexcellent and well-designed dance floor\ninto a robust gymnasium. All the fittings for the apparatus had to be remade so\nthat they could be used In this gymnasium;\nthis takes time. Hew equipment had to be\nCLOTHES AND\nDear Sir and Mr.'Christian Dior'-vid\nStevens,\nI must admit that the wearing of\nJeans, check shirt, baggy pullover and\nfluorescent sook s does not make an engineer, but on the other hand I defy anyone\nto prove that white\u2014eo llar and tie out-fits make engineers. Surely It could be\nwithin the realms of possibility that in this rather unreal student world of ours,\nsome people by dressing in a more casual\nfashion, might find it easier to live and\nwork. % personal experience is that the\nwearing of such o lot he s breeds in me a state of mind that accepts the*very serious'\ntrivialities of student organisations, and\nmakes me was t to help in the work Involved\nin these.\nOf course, jk. cannot claim that others\nwould find the same, but I think that our\nPresident was mistaken to express such a private opinion at the Freshers' Dinners.\nOn these ooo as ions he is unassailable as\nfar as argument is concerned, and he also\npossesses a far greater sway over new\nstudents, nervously groping their way\nthrough the first few weeks at College .\nHoping, then, that inthe future Dave will confine his 'criticisms' to the well-worn\nbut increasingly acute problem of the 10-5\nbrown-bag ger,I remain\nYour faithful friend,\nSyd Lenssen.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR bought, from balls up to the complete fit tings of ropes and beams. This task of\nconversion is not only dealt with by\nmembers of I.C. but also the organisers\nof the U.L. U. Gymnasium. It is not an\neasy problem.\nBesides taking time it also takes\nmoney, and money does not flow rapidly when\nthere is a large programme in Princes\nGardens. When it was decided to turn the\ndance floor into a gymnasium, most of the\nmoney allocated for that part of the\nUnion had been used. To convert and\ncompletely equip the hall was not favourable from the financial point of view.If\nit had not been for the generosity of the\nCollege, the tolerance of the Planning\nOffice and the forethought of some students\nabout a year ago you would not have had a gymnasium at all, yet.\nYours etc.,\nI.J. Flint\n(Gymnasium Organiser)\nEditor's note:\nMr. Flint has not corrected a single\none of the facts stated in our art iole. He makes no mention of our main point,\nthe unfortunate installation and subsequent boxing-in of the radiators.\nThe fact that it was only recently\ndecided to have a gymnasium (although\nthe plans published in1954 showed it) has not previously been made public. If it be necessary to make 'mistakes' in order to uncover the facts of the matter,\nFELIX will be making many more.\nCRITICISM\nDear Editor,\nI address my letter thus because I do not wish ?T. Lenaaen to consider my\nremarks at the Fresher's Dinner to be\ndirected towards him in particular.\nI must admit that in !y. Lenssen's letter I have read for the first time\nthat o are less nes and casualness go hand\nin hand with efficiency - the opposite\nis always the case.\nAs for his criticism that I should\nnot use my position as President to\ninfluence the easily impressionable\nfresher s,I should like to point out\nthat there ia little point in taking\nup such a position if one does not in tend to exert any influence, so long\nas one is sure that one's influences\nare directed towards the right end.\nAlso I had hoped that everyone had\nnoticed that I gave first place to\nadvising the fresher s on the more\nobvious subject of the 1 0 - 5 brown-bag gers. And now to turn the tone from defence\nto attack: this is the first criticism\nI have received on this subject and to\nJudge from the reception my remarks\nreceived at the dinners I feel that the\nvast majority of the College agree with\nme. Freshers, pless e draw your own con-clu s ions! Yours, in bed with ' flu, F. David Stevens.\nE.C. REPLIES\nDear Sir, On behalf of the Entertainments\nCommittee I feel I must take this opportunity to reply to the criticisms\nlevelled at the Committee in a letter\nto your paper last issue.\nFir Bt lyI must point out that the\nEditor failed to notify the Entertainments Committee of such criticisms thus\npreventing us replying in the same\" issue.\nAlthough the Entertainments Committee\nwas, at the time, and still is reduced to\nthree members instead of six this Committee was set the task of running no fewer than four functions in a fortnight.\nNot only was this done to the satisfaction\nof the majority of da no ers, but the amenities\navailable were also improved.\nWith regard to the authors* remarks about\nan East-End working -mens club, I feel this\ncan be attributed rather to the behaviour\nand dr ese of certain students than to the\nmanner in wh i oh the dances are organised.\nSurely it is not too much to ask that a man wears a tie, a jacket and a pair of\ntrousers with some form of vertical crease\nin them.\nI agree that it Is far better that a student acts as Master of Ceremonies\nrather than the band leader, but if one\nmember of the Committee had not to spend\nthat complete evening asking \"Non-paying\nguests \" to leave it would have been pos-sib le. The Committee regret that not all students\nwho wish to attend Saturday-night dances can\nbe accommodated, but have done their utmost\nto increase the number of dancers by opening\nthe Upper Eefectory.\nI therefore feel that In the light of these\nfacts the authors should reconsider their\nstatements and promptly offer their apologies\nto the few people who have worked so hard to\nmake these dances possible.\nYours faithfully Gil Streets.\nEditor's note:\nWe apologise to the Entertainments\nCommittee for not giving them the opportunity to reply in the last issue. It is not our poll oy to serial is e correspondence of this nature.\nDear Sir, We appreciate the difficult conditions\nunder which the depleted Committee has been\nworking, and we were glad to notice a marked improvement in the organisation of the\nlast two E.C,ho ns. We suggest that the tickets axe collected\nat the door to prevent the entry of 'non-paying guests' as the present system is not\nfoolproof.\nYours faithfully, f.S. Smith\nF. Porgess.\nEditor's note:\nThe past experience of the Enter*\ntain ment a Committee leads them to\nbelieve that the system in use at the.\nmoment is the most practicable.\nCAHTOOKS. cartoonists and ideas for\ncartoons required by Pellx.

ISOO\nDAY TO REMEMBER PRACTICAL POLITICS\nFELIX is a non-political newspaper.\nNo-one tells us what to print, and we\nhare no party axe to grind. We would\nrather stand aloof, and examine the poli t ical world with a completely open mind,\nas if surveying the moon through a mammoth telescope, ascertaining the facts\nobjectively and basing our opinions ac-cord ingly. Let us, then, turn our mammoth\ntelescope on the latest political development in the University. Some pamphlets have recently been distributed\nIn I.C. and other colleges by the National Guardian Ifcvement. At the same\ntime, there appeared in SENNET a front\npage leader on tho subject of this\nmovement.\nIn the pamphlets that have appeared is advertised a meeting to commemorate \"The 40th. Anniversary of the destruction of a Democracy1\n! Let us ask\nexactly what was destroyed in October\n1917.\nIn SENNET we read:n After all this\nwe still could not discover how the\norganisation can justify its claim that\n23* of the lecturers are Communist but\nwith such a charming set-up as we hare\nhere, who cares?\" Let us ask what they\ndid to find out, as well as what the\nhauls of the original statement is.

The 23rd. of October is the first anniversary\nof the Hungarian Revolution. Nearly a year has passed, though it seems that it happened only yesterday. Recalling our\nmemories, there are two main points\nto think about .\nFrom one hand we thank the free world\nfor their moral support of our struggle\nagainst the ruthless suppression of\nour freedom and independence, and for\nthe economic aid and ho a pili ty. From the other hand; some time passed\nand the Hungarian problem was not a headline any more. The refugees found\nnew homes, started new lives. A small\nbut enthusiastic group of the newcomers\ntried to pick up the western way of life at the famous I.C. Hostel (starting with\nthe sherry party at I. C.W. A.). After\na few any steps they became quite familiar\nwith the Union facilities( including\nthe bar, hops, the dropping of milk\nbottles etc).\nBut while enjoying the wonderful,\nfreedom and democracy of this country, one\nmust not forget that life is not the same\nfor everyone in the world.\nT.S. \u2014 L.K. EXCHANGE STUDENTSHIPS\nI.C. has arranged with three European technological institutions, two in Germany, one in Switzerland, for the exchange of students for the session 1958-59. Details can be obtained from the Regi s try. ACLAND ESSAT PRIZE\nReaders are reminded of the Sir Arthur Acland English Essay Prize, which\nwas instituted to encourage the good\nwriting of English. The competition is open to all undergraduates, and a total\nof 25 guineas Is available for p rises. Entries should be submitted by\nJanuary 15th,1958. Further particulars\nmay be seen in the Registry.\nSPOOR T Remember, remember, the 5th of November \u2014 at the time of going to press\nit seems likely that there will again\nthis year be a bonfire and hop at Harlington, with coach transport from the\nUnion provided.\nOther events of a social nature\nscheduled for this term are the Guilds\nCarnival (Nov.22nd), on an Ancient Greek\ntheme this year, we hear; the Mines Ball will be held a week l ster, on the 29th, and FELIX'S own birthday hop will take\nplace on the 30th. Morphy Day is on November 4th this\nyear. Mines will be defending the Mbrphy\no up, and Guilds the Lowry. It is hoped\nthat as many members as possible will travel down to Putneyto support their\nrespective teams and drown their rivals. SHIPTON PRAISES I.C, MEN (cent.)\nThe Siechen glacier, the biggest in the world outside Polar regions, has been\nvisited only twice before, and very little is known about It, The party split up into\ngroups, which each carried out various\ngeological and other scientific invest-ig at ions. They were helped by eight local\nmen, who carried equipment.\nThe medical member of the expedition,\nDr. Graham Budd, had little in the way of\nsickness or injury to deal with, apart\nfrom a oas e of stomach disorder. Lying in his tent, the invalid would start to mutter \" I must get out; and then a moment\nlater: \" It's too late1; Any highlights? Brian Amos hung upside down in a crevasse for about an hour\nbefore the others could pull him out, and\nthen they spent the rest of the day recovering his load, which he had dropped\non to a ledge. Entertainment was all home-made, of course. Pete Grimley'a extensive\nsong repertoire was called upon, while for\nthe benefit of the local people, Eric himself performed the Charleston.\nAll in all, a valuable and enjoyable\nexpedition. But, as Mr. Shipton, pointed\nout, \" it's very much of a continuous\nthing? It must be followed up soon so\nthat the experience gained is not wasted\nas far as the College iso ono er ned. SALVATION\nMy dear Editor,\nOver the past year I have\nexamined the many philosophies offered by\nthe religious, political and other soci e ties of the Imperial College, but none\nof them has been able to answer my quest-ions, to offer the secret of a happy,\nuseful existence, the ultimate purpose and\ndrive behind human endeavour. It would\nseem that we have become so sophisticated,\nso out of touch with the good mother earth,\nthat we must run blindly from artificial stimulant to official boredom, regency\narchitecture and potato crisps. I think, I hope (and who would dare to claim mors in this unbalanced and crisis-ridden world)\nthat I Lave, in my personal meditations,\nfound what may, after all, be the final salvation of mankind. Ws must, in some\nmeasure, look back to our happy, uncomplicated, arboreal culture.\nThose who are Interested in the rediscovery of this, our heritage, may find\nout more about the proposed \"I.C. Tree\nClimbing Society\" from me, through the\nUnion Rack,\nI am, sir, Buster Cole.\nFIFTEEN I Dear Sir, How can the Hugger Club hope that\ntheir First team will be as str on c as\never if they are going to decrease the\nnumber of players in the team from f if teen to ele ren. We can only hope that their optimism\nwill make up for this lack of numbers.\nYours faithfully, Jennifer Heywood,\nPresident, I. C.W. A. Noellne Cowgill,\nPresident, I.C. W.S.C. P.3.

BABY FOUND IN QUADRANGLE UNFORTUNATE EPISODE MAPS FRESHERS' NIGHT\nAt 11 o 'clock on the night of the first R.C.S. Freshers' dinner, a baby\nwas found in the middle of the Union quadrangle. The President of the Union\nand the Warden of the Hostel quickly arrived on the scene and supervised the\nremoval of the baby, whose name is believed to be Austin, to Prince Consort\nHead, where it was left for the night. By the following morning it had dis-appeared. Several such episodes have occurred recently; it is reported that\nsteps are being taken to discourage the offenders.\nEarlier in the evening the E.C. S. Freshers' dinners got off to a roaring\nstart, the lively and enthusiastic atmosphere being marred only by \"a couple of\nshockingly weak stories, which were, how-ever, dealt with in suitable manner. The\ndinner itself was of a high standard,\nand this was maintained by J*. Ifconey for\nthe following nights.\nSpeaking at Wednesday's dinner, Br.\nAtkinson counselled fresher s to exercise\ngreat care in choosing digs. He himself\nhad found (later, he said) that MB landlady was running a house of ill-repute.\nAdvice on this matter could be had from\ntutors.\nA bout of lusty singing in the Bar\non Thursday was terminated when some\nMiners present challenged B.C.S. to a 'game' of buk-buk. The design of the Bar\nproved ideal for this purpose, and the\nR.C.S. men equal to the occasion, trouncing both the Mines and Guilds teams\ntwice. The Scientists were then also victorious in a boat-race Khngellal\nOn Friday t ne R.C.S. women descended en masse on the Upper Dining Hall.\nIn her speech, Was Haywood said that Mr.\nButters had given her only one hour's notice, and this had quite spoiled her\ndinner. To rectify this small matter, she\nsuggested that Mr. Butters should take\nher out to dinner. They were later seen\ncomparing diaries.\nFRESHERS GUILDED\nIn a characteristically happy atmosphere, the ritual Guilds Freshers dinners\nwere held In the Upper Dining Ball on\nfive evenings last week.\nFor the first three evenings, President Dave Stevens took the chair, before\nsuccumbing to the dreaded ' flu. On the\nother two evenings the chair was taken by\nTioe President John Sheldon. ( All tbe\nchairs were eventually recovered).\nThe President's speech contained the\nusual advice and ad\u00bbnish a ent to be heard\non this occasion, although his scathing\ncomments on brown bagging and personal\ndress were in a rather more serious vein.\nAs of yore, the after-dinner speakers\nsaid absolutely nothing in a highly amusing fashion, ending with their usual\n'jokes'. Age old gambits were employed:\n\"Mr, President, Gentlemen and Chemical\nEngineers....\" (cheers, groans and genes al disorder). When the speakers were dry, the\nSpanner was shown to the fresher s, the\n\"Boomalaka\" rendered with great gusto, and\nthe adjournment moved to the usual place.\nThe singing in the Bar was of a very\nlusty nature, being remarkable for its volume, quality (I) and versatility. Accounts of after events are naturally\nincoherent, seeming to indicate that extensive inebriation was attained with un-failing consistently.\nSHIPTON PRAISE SI.C. MEN The see on d part of the Karakoram expedition team has now returned to England.\nAt an exclusive FELIX-PHOENIX interview,\nour reporter was able to talk to Mr. Erie\nShipton, the leader of the expedition and\na very experienced explorer and mountaineer who has taken part in several Everest\nexpeditions, and has established a strong\nreputation for work that he has previously\ndone in the Karakoram.\nThe idea behind the expedition was to\nbuild in the College a nucleus of men with\nexperience of exploration who would be\nleaders of further expeditions, all with\nthe same object of Scientific Investigation\nof \"new\" territory. In this, Mr. Shipton\nsaid, the expedition had been entirely successful. Although the party was very young\nand had had comparatively little previous\nexperience, they made up for this by their\nkeenness and enthusiasm. Indeed, there had\nbeen far less friction than he had ever\nknown before on an expedition.\nUnfortunately, the expedition was delayed for three weeks, which were virtually wasted, by the non-arrival of their baggage,\nand later on the weather became very bad;\ndaily snowfalls hampered them considerably.\nThe baggage apparently arrived outside\nBombay harbour three weeks before the ex-p edition, but it was not possible to get\nit ashore for six weeks'. This state of\naffairs appears to be quite usual in Bombay, and it is quite inconceivable that\nthe College agents did not know of it. If the expedition had been informed, they\ncould probably have taken their equipment\nalong with them, but they were taken completely unawares.\n1 8 , 0 0 0 FT. UP\nIn order to reach the scene of op-e rations, the Siechen glacier, the party\nhad to cross an 16,000' pass. One of the\nstrange sights they a aw was an eagle, apparently exhausted, also crossing the past\non foot.\ncontinued os page A. Wednesday distinguished itself with\nan at tes n it by several obstreperous B.C.S. men to whisk away the Spanner, but thanks\nto the instantaneous reflexes of a prominent member of the Guilds' staff, their\neffort was in vain. One of the bandits\nwas sei sed; he ended the evening with\nnothing but a shirt to e over his\nrass sm nt. Several incidents by a minority oar-red the festivities. On Thursday fireworks\nwere thrown in the lounge, while on Friday\nchairs were thrown about in the lounge aria\ndamaged, and glas aes were thrown against\nthe ceiling. Drunkezmeaa is no excuse for\nvandalism. It la incredible that in an\nUniversity, where people profess to bo ed-uc a ted, such hooligan behaviour should\noccur.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX1. i THE REFECTORY\nSITUATION\n\"The College refectories are now\nBarring approximately 1500 lunches daily, an increase of 450 over the corresponding\nfigure a year ago! This surprising fact\nwas disclosed by sr. Ifconey, I.C, Refectory Manager, in an exclusive interview\nwith FEUS reporters. Mr. Mooney pointed\nout that the kitchens in the Onion are\nnow turning out 1000 lunches daily, as\nagainst 500 last October, The inadequacy\nof the kitchens and staff shortages are\nthe two main problems facing the Refectory today.\nWHERE DO THET GOT\nOn analysis, the number of lunches\nserved dally in the Loser Refectory is500, the same as last year. The Upper\nDining Hall and Upper Refectory, neither\nof wh i oh was in operation last year, are\nnow serving 400-500 between them. Against\nthis, there has been a slight drop in Queenie's, from 600 dally to about 530.\nThe kitchens in Queenie's, however, are\nfar larger than those in the Union. The\nrefrigerator space, for instance, is four\ntimes the size.\nPRICES\nIt is being found necessary to raise\nprices slightly. The refectories lost\nmoney last year. As a result of this and\nincreased payments to staff, there will be fewer 1/9 dishes available, for ex*\nample, and the prices of special dinners\nare also being raised. The refectory wage\nbill is now 30% higher than it was a year\nago, and the income has to follow suit.\nAs members of the Union will have\nobserved, prices are in rather a state\nof flux at the moment. The profit needed\nto cover wages and overheads is40% of\nthe oost price of the food. If this be\nexceeded, the prices will be reduced ac-cord ingly. However, in the oas e of the\nCornish Pasty, the fluctuations between\n1/9 and 2/0 are governed by the o on te 'nts,\nand not by the slide\u2014rule computations\nof the cashier.\nHOT OR COLD?\nThe most unfortunate feature of the\nkitchens in the Union Is the perpetual\ndraught that whistles through, and Is\npartly responsible for the rapid cooling\nof food when it Is removed from the ovens.\n(The 297 is also a non-starter on Saturday, unfortunately.) If the \"Gyre sad\ntumble? Just off Timers Street, is\nstill open, you ean always drop in for\na cup of o of fee. Footnotet\nIf something does go wrong, the\nnicest walk back ia along the Vest Side\nof Clapham .Crtsmen and over the Albert\nMage.\n* au cU ab te please. It is a result of the design of the kitchens: it cannot be eradicated \u2014 only\nmitigated. In an effort to do this, new\nmethods of keeping the food warm are\nconstantly being tried. One infra-red\nheater has already been installed; the\npurchase of another is contemplated.\nHOW TOU CAN HELP\nOne of the ways in which you can\naid the efficient running of the refectories is simply by not removing their\ncutlery and crockery. The losses last\nyear were Immense, and much was not recovered \u2014 it all contributes to the\nrise in prices. Mr. Mooney has also\nbeen aggrieved lately by the disappearance of pepper-pot-tops \u2014 it should be\nperfectly possible to obtain the goods\nthrough the apertures provided.\nWe discovered that not even Mr.\nMooney knows what goes into the Mulligatawny soup. On being asked, he\nsmiled his enigmatic smile:\"Tour guess\nis as good as mine. We try to make the\nfood interesting?\nWINE TASTING SOCIETY\nThe first, meeting of the Session was\nwell attended - too well,in fact, 70\npeople being present, ll any latecomers\nwere refused admittance as both sherry\nand seating were insufficient for a greater number.\nMr. MsKenzie, who lectured at the\ninaugural meeting of the Society, introduced the tasting with an informative\nlecture on the production of sherry.\nHe emphasised the special system of\nblending the wines - the Solera system\n- which ensures a continuity of style,\nquality and age.\nFour kinds of sherry were tasted:\nManzanilla Finn (a dry wine with a salty tang)\nAmontillado (a young and old variety)\nOloroso (a very sweet wine)\nthe special characteristics of each\nbeing indicated by the speaker.\nSeveral lively questions terminated\nthe a ee ting. The next meeting will be on Oct. 29th when Italian wines will be tasted.\nQuote: \"Sweetness often covers a multitude of sins.\" - - - Baa 1\nBO' PEEPS OUT\nAfter months of comparative inactivity\nBo' has a busy time ahead of him. He now\nsports a current licence, the absence of\nwhich prevented his appearance earlier this term.\nOn test last week after a preliminary\n\"Tune-up\" he was put through his paces\ncareering around the block and making\nseveral circuits of Hyde Park at speed.\n(Onlookers rumoured that he had been\nsupercharged, but thi3 is not correct)\nBo's busy period commences on Sunday\nNov. 3rd. when he participates as usual\nin the annual London to Brighton Vintage\nCar Rally, ( its non-appear an oe last\nyear was due to secretarial and not\nmechanical in ne ff ici eno y) Travelling\nin Bo' will be C. and G.

In\ntwo weeks the club has played nineteen\nmatches, winning seventeen, drawing\none and losing one with a goals tally of 87 against 35.\nThe first XI has won all its matches to date. The results have been\nachieved because the team has played\neffective football. At most times the\ndefence has played soundly, covering well,\nand tackling hard, and there has been a good understanding with the goalkeeper,\nThs forwards have combined well, genera ll y kept the play open and have accepted\nmost of their chances.
