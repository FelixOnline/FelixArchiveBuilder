    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 1 7TH IANUARY\nIC Biosphere research into ecosystem\nUMBAR SALE EM International scientists have built a biosphere at Imperial College's Silwood Park research centre which\nwill allow scientists to simulate conditions in the environment caused by\npollution. For the past three years\nProfessor John Lawton has been\nleading a research team investigating\nthe effects of global warming on\nagriculture and animal life.\nThe biosphere has many eco-chambers where sunlight is simulated using powerful halogen lamps,\nand various gases are added to create\nan environment that has been subjected to the equivalent of seventy\nyears of pollution. Professor Lawton\nexplained that good as well as bad\nconclusions have been drawn from\nthe study. The project revealed that\nthe soil absorbed carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere which accelerated its decomposition and would\n\"increase the rate of global warm-ing,\" yet \"the effects on plants and\ninsects were much less dramatic than\nexpected.\"\nThe results from the \u00a31 million\nEcotron experiment, to be published\nin April, will add new flavour to the\ndebate on the long term effects of\npresent day pollution. Professor\ndecreased rainfall over the past ten\nyears. Even though it is difficult to\nmake very accurate predictions, Dr\nHefin Jones, also working at Silwood\nLawton is convinced that the effects\nof global warming can be seen\nalready with warmer summers and\nPark, is confident of the results.\n\"There is now enough research data\navailable to leave no doubt of the\nchange,\" he stated.\nSome ecologists and climatologists also agree that recent anomalies\nobserved by plant growers in Britain\nare an indication of very gradual\nchanges taking place in the world's climate. For the first time ever, plants\ntraditionally grown in warmer countries are surviving in Britain. We can\nnow grow peppers, melons, bananas,\nFrench beans and outdoor cherry\ntomatoes. As a consequence of this,\nDavid Jeffery from Unwin's Seeds,\nHiston, warned that \"Many of the\nvegetables now grown in the South\nof England may disappear in time.\"\nVegetables such as sprouts, cabbage,\nrunner beans and turnips are finding\nit harder to compete, possibly due to\npoisonous chemicals in the atmosphere which weaken the plants making them susceptible to disease.\nThis debate rages on. Climate\nchanges that are attributed to pollution could be due to other factors.\nThe Ecotron experiment is the first of\nits kind in the world and will be able\nto predict the consequences of\nhumankind's actions today on the\nTesting mad cows at St Mary's KENT YIP\nProfessor John Collinge and his\nPrion Research Group at St Mary's Hospital Medical School may pave\nthe way for developing a new test\nwhich allows early diagnosis of the\nnew strain of CJD, according to the\nlatest edition of the medical journal\nThe Lancet.\nAt present, confirmation of the\ndiagnosis of CJD can only be done\nin a post-mortem examination.\nConducting a, his to logical exam in a tion, an examination of the morphology of the cell, on brain tissues\nprovides the only alternative. Beside\nthe obvious risks involved in carrying out a brain biopsy to obtain the\ntissues, this method is also unr eli able. Test on tissues from the ton-sil s, which can be removed under\nlocal anaesthetics by a relatively\nsimple procedure, may bring new\nhope to clinicians in making a more\nconfident diagnosis.\nPrevious attempts to employ antibodies for a similar purpose proved\nunsuccessful because there are not\nenough structural differences at the\nmolecular level for the antibodies to\ndistinguish between the normal prion\nprotein, which is present in healthy\nindividuals, and the abnormal prion\nprotein, which causes CJD. At St\nMary's, an abnormal prion protein\nassociated with the new strain of\nCJD has recently been identified in\ntonsil tissues. This finding is further\nsupported by his to logical analyses of\nthe tonsil tissues.\nThe new strain was discovered by\nthe same group in October last year,\nand its resemblance to the protein\nthat causes BSE is closer than any\nother previous strain. This reinforces\nthe popular belief that the recent outbreak of CJD is caused by the consumption of BSE contaminated meat\nproducts. In contrast to classical\nCJD, the new variant arises in\nyounger patients, affecting people\nunder the age of 50, has a longer\nduration of illness and presents different path o logie s. The implication of the new test is\nprofound. Symptoms of CJD, which\ninclude depression and sensory dis-turban ce, are similar to other treatable degenerative diseases. Writing\nto The Lancet, Professor Collinge\nexplained that if there were to be an\nepidemic of CJD, and if the new\nstrain of CJD was indeed caused by\nBSE, early markers would be essential for differential diagnosis as the\npresenting features are non-specific.\nSpeaking to Felix, Andrew Hill,\nco-author of the letter published in\nThe Lancet, stressed that at the\nmoment the abnormal protein has\nonly been identified in the tonsils of\na dead patient. However, the protein\nresponsible for scrap ie, the equivalent of CJD in sheep, has been reported by a Dutch research group to present in the tonsils of infected sheep\nwhen they are still alive. In fact, it\ncan be detected long before the\noccurrence of early symptoms.\nThe research group at St Mary's hope that samples of tonsil tissues\nfrom living patients suspected of\nCJD can been sent in from other hospitals to confirm their finding. The\nmajor difficulty in turning it into a routine clinical test would be the\nrequirement of special containment\nlaboratories, due to the highly infectious nature of the prion protein. He\nwent on to explain that the same procedure might be of use in diagnosing\nother variants of CJD.\nCurrently, while only a small proportion of all the CJD cases are suspected to be linked to BSE, 15% are\nthought to have arisen as a result of\ngenetic mutation with the majority\noccurring sporadically with no\nknown cause.\nFunding - RAE\nlink\nJACKIE S KEA TE Following the results of the national\nResearch Assessment Exercise published last week, some universities\nhave expressed uncertainty about the\nslightly different score system and\nits link with future HE research\nfunding.\nImperial College was ranked\nfourth in the UK, with almost all\ndepartments receiving a score of 5 or\n5* (on a scale of 1, 2, 3a,3b,4,5 and\n5*). The results of the RAE are used\nto determine the levels of funding\nallocated to each department.\nDespite the fact that College\nstands in a good position to be\nawarded more research funds overall\nthan most other universities, there\nhave been fears expressed that this\nmay not be enough. Dr Rodney\nEastwood from the Financial\nPlanning department indicated that\nCollege \"was expected to do at least\nas well as in 1992\", but as yet, the\namount of funding attached to different ratings is unknown, as the scoring system has changed since 1992,\nwhen departments were assessed on\na scale running from 1-5.\nThe Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England committee will\nmeet next week to decide the basis\non which funding is allocated.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 1 7TH JANUARY COLUMNS11/ Westminster Eye - Hamish Common\nm Teaching If unions broke\na prolonged\nhabit recent-ly, praising\nConservative\neducation policy at the expense of\nLabour's 'nanny state' plans to\ndemand half an hour's homework per\nnight in primary schools and an hour\nand a half's worth per night in secondary schools. Nigel de Gruchy,\nGeneral Secretary of the NASUWT\ndeclared that \"the Government's approach will commend itself more\nto the profession than the high-hand-ed dictatorial 'we know best'\napproach from Tony Blair.\" A similar view was expressed by the NUT.\nThe School's Minister, Robin Squire\nrather enjoyed the rare union support,\ncriticising Labour's policy as \"insult-ing teachers\". Stealing thunder from\nLabour, Mr Squire also announced a \u00a360,000 provision for 12 pilot projects for encouraging homework,\nincluding a 'homework hotline', saying that he agreed with Labour on the\nprinciple of homework, but that\nschools and teachers should have discretion in setting work. Alluding to\nJack Straw's proposals for curfews\nand bedtimes, Mr Squire said that \"a few months ago there was a suggestion from Jack Straw that children\nshould be tucked in bed at a particular time. Presumably David Blunkett\n[the Shadow Education Secretary]\nwould be going round checking they\nhad done their homework first.\"\nThe three main political parties have\nbeen desperately scrambling over\neach other to convey themselves to\nthe public as 'the party of education'\never since the Liberal Democrats\ncommitted themselves to raising tax\nto increase education spending by\none billion pounds a year. The\nGovernment have done their level\nbest to privat is e schools in all but\nname, introducing the internal market and allowing increasing levels of\nselection. Since Tony Blair's proclamation at the party conference that\nhis first three priorities were \"e duca tion, education and education\",\nLabour's contribution consisted of\nscrapping assisted places, and lots of\nhot air. This finally culminated in a White Paper promising a giant\nEducation Act, to be passed early on.\nin a Labour term, which would\nreverse much of the present\nGovernment's policy. There is less to\nbe found on Labour's intentions with\nHigher Education: their main intentions are to replace the\nloan/grant/parental contribution with\na loan, saying rather patronising ly that students would be grateful for\nthe increased simplicity of the s ys tem. Nor will any more favourable\npolicies be found in the other parties'\nmanifestos, the Conservatives for the\nmain part keeping the status quo, and\nthe Liberal Democrats' ten figure\nsum is to be spent on nursery and primary education. Sadly, there are few\nvotes in Higher Education: the young\ndon't vote and all the parties know it.\nThe renewed political emphasis on\neducational matters has been brought\nabout by three factors: the constant\nembarrassment as Britain is shown\nagain to have low academic standards on the international stage, the\nimportance of a skilled workforce in\nan increasingly technological age\nand by far the most important for the\npoliticians, the enormous potential\nfor votes from people in their 30s and\n40s with children at school, from\nwhich there is a high turnout at elections. Labour intend to build on the\nGovernment's campaign to increase\nthe standards of the teaching profession with the creation of a General\nTeaching Council to promote professionalism and regulate discipline,\nand a new \"advanced skills grade\" to\nreward the best teachers who wish to\nstay in the profession. It seems\nLabour intend to address what I believe is one of the most serious\nproblems with the teaching profession today, in that it still considers\nitself a 'workforce' that requires to\nbe union is ed, rather than a profession\nto which people can aspire to. When\nteachers are seen in the same professional light as doctors or lawyers, the\npowers that be, including the\nGovernment and parents, may treat\nthem with the respect that many of\nthem deserve.\nThe most worrying and contentious\naspect of Labour's plans were\nexcluded from Labour's weekend\ntrumpeting of their new White Paper.\nThe proposal followed standard\nLabour practice, which is to look\nmore Tory than the Conservative\nParty, but with the slightest inspection of the document one can see the\ntrue Labour policies buried within.\nThis is not to say that I think they're\ndire, but it would be nice for them to\nbe honest about what they really\nwant to do once in while! The issue\nat hand is the reinstatement of Local\nEducation Authorities as the final\narbiters in school matters - they will\nregain control of selection and spend-ing. Plenty of legislation will be\ndevoted to cosmetic changes, such as\ncalling them 'Foundation Schools'\nrather than opt-out schools, and is\nthis already drawing fire from parents one hand and left-wingers on the\nother, who justifiably say that the\nsystem will remain two-tier.\nAs with the usual vogue issues, there\nhas been political point-scoring and\nmisleading statistics as the parties vie\nfor this juicy political opportunity. It\nseems Labour may have overreached themselves this time: union\nleaders do not find themselves condemning Labour whilst agreeing\nwith Conservative policies very\noften. The Guardian had a leader\npraising Labour's policy - not a rare\noccurrence - using rather irrelevant\nstatistics to back it up. According to\nthem homework is a better indication\nof success than social class, justifying this with the fact that children\nwho do lots of homework do well.\nAny sensible person can see that children who do lots of homework and\nstudents who study hard will be more\nlikely to succeed. The Conservatives\nare missing a an opportunity to take\nsome credit for this: they have broken much of the \"we're working\nclass and proud of it\" attitude that\nholds down people who consider\nthemselves part of such a group and\ntherefore unable to break out. It has\nshown that many people from poor\nbackgrounds can succeed - indeed it\nused this very fact to devastating\neffect in the 1983 and 1987 election\ncampaigns. There has been a culture\nchange during these years of\nConservative Government, and it is\nnow assumed that people who do\nwork hard may well be rewarded at\nthe expense of those who don't. This\nis at the root of Conservative education policy. The Labour grass roots\nbelieve in opportunity for all, on an\nequal basis, which is not what their\nleadership is proposing. There may\nbe a battle within a future Labour\nGovernment, with the leadership\nclaiming that they're scrapping ide-ology, and the rank and file claiming\nthey're more Tory than the Tories.\nAn Explanatory Sonnet\n(for Simon Baker)\nIn general, life's swell at IC,\nApart from the poems in Felix weekly,\nWhy should the writers seem so down at heart\nWhen college is un alloyed joy from the start?\nAfter all, there's no reason for w hinges or moans,\nNow we've got access to student loans.\nWell, as students we 're cheerful and uncomplicated,\nDespair is pass e and depression outdated.\nBut poems require a different view,\nMost poets are miserable (and most poems too)\nTo succeed in this field angst you should nurse,\nSo would-be poets write disconsolate verse.\nThe moral I'm sure is easy to see,\nWe 're only happy to a degree.\n(or PhD, I suppose)\nLaura PoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial College, and we are always\nhappy to greet new members.

    "content": "6 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 17TH IANUARY\nGun$ or Brfad?\nKelly Robinson looks into a recent Government\npolicy on the vetting of Overseas students at UK\nuniversities.\nA former Imperial College student is\ncurrently serving the first month of\nher twenty year sentence for her part\nin the Israeli Embassy bombing.\nSamar Alami graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering and\nproceeded to use the knowledge she\nacquired during her studies to wreak\nhavoc in central London during\nNovember 1994.\nThis incident prompted Parliament\nto take swift action. The Foreign and\nCommonwealth Office implemented\na voluntary agreement with universities to consider carefully applications\nfor PhD and research placements\nfrom some overseas students.\nIn a letter to the Chairman of the\nCommittee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals, Mr Tim Boswell, MP,\nstates that \"...the Government attaches great importance to preventing the\ntransfer of technology related to the\ndevelopment of mass destruction.\"\nInstitutions are now asked to volunteer details of the candidates'\nemployment and academic background to the Government, along\nwith information about their proposed course and its length.\nUniversities are then advised of the\nrisks involved in admitting a particular student, though the final decision\nis left to their discretion.\nOnly students from certain countries designated by our Government\nare subject to such vetting. The\nGovernment have stressed that the\nlist is \"subject to amendment in the\nlight of changed circumstances.\"\nThe success of this policy is still\ndoubtful as only 7 8 students have\nbeen reported by universities since\n1994\nAs of this month, universities will\nhave no choice as to whether to submit the details of such students to the\nForeign Office. The morality of such\na policy has been called into question\nby many, and the whole issue is a potential ethical minefield. This\ndilemma has particular resonance at\nIC, where over 30% of students come\nfrom overseas.\nThe majority of the students ques-tio ned, those from Britain and the\n\"Most research at IC is\nconsidered., to be\npotentially dangerous\nknowledge.\"\ncountries listed, see the vetting of students as both a violation of human\nrights and unfair. They feel that all\npeople are equally capable of using\nknowledge to the greater good or\nindeed to the detriment of society.\nThis being the case, it is not the\nGovernments\nplace to decide\nwho is and who\nis not a caring\nenough person\nto study in this\ncountry.\nStudents from the countries involved feel they have been\nsingled out and as left bewildered as\nto why their homelands and people\nconsidered irresponsible. This is\nespecially so because of the elusive\nnature of the criteria used to compile\nthe list of dangerous countries means\nthat it is impossible to tell exactly\nwhy each individual country was pin-pointed.\nThere are also those students who\ndeem the process to be a necessary\nevil, which, if implemented correctly,\ncould prevent the needless death of\ninnocent civilians in the future.\nAmongst these students it is generally considered that, although the system may be unjust, it is preferable for\none foreign student to suffer than to\nrun the risk of letting he/she cause the\ndeath of others.\nMore again felt\nthat the only fair\nway to set about\nmonitoring students would be to\nensure all students\nwere included,\nthus increasing the\nlikelihood of nipping any dark aspirations in the bud.\nA small minority supported the\npolicy whole-hearted ly, stressing that\nthose with nothing to hide should\nhave no cause to object to it being\nimplemented or to themselves being\nvetted.\nSome members of the IC staff feel\nthat the whole system is seriously\nCOUNTRIES CURRENTLY\nON THE VETTING\n\"BLACKLIST\":\nIsrael, Libya, Iran, Iraq,\nSyria, Cuba, Egypt and\nNorth Korea as well as\nCommonwealth members\nIndia and Pakistan.\nflawed. Dr Hassard, the Post\nGraduate Admissions Tutor in the\nPhysics Department expressed concern over the Government's list of\n\"risk\" countries \"...it requires amend-ment. Many of those on the list are\nsignatories of the Nuclear Non-pro1 if e ration Treaty. Dr\nHas s ard believes a certain amount of\nracism is\ninvolved, with\nBritain making\njudgements as\nto which countries are suitable to\nown nuclear weapons. He believes\nthat Parliament needs to address the\nbroader issues, with curbing the\nspread of nuclear materials taking\npriority.\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, the Rector,\nhas said that the policy serves the\npurpose of reassuring those universities which feel ill at ease with the\nwhole subject. It is his belief that it is\npart of a much larger initiative by\nboth the British and other govern-ment s. The general consensus of opinion\namongst those officials available to\ncomment at the embassies involved\nis that the system is inherently\nwrong. The Israeli Embassy see it as\nan infringement of the human rights\nof the individuals\ninvolved. It felt that\nthe Government\nwere unjust in their\nimplementation of\nsuch a policy.\nThere are however,\nno plans in\nprogress to see this\nruling repealed.\nThe situation\nraises a barrage of controversial\nissues and there are many questions\nwhich appear to be left unaddressed.\nBritain, for example, saw fit to sell a vast quantity of missiles and various\nother military dangerous articles to\nIraq when the Government were\naware that the Gulf war was imminent. Effectively, British soldiers\nwere killed by weapons sold to their\nenemy by their own country! How\ncan such a country deem some countries worthy of nuclear weapons and\nothers unworthy?\nWhy is it that Middle Eastern\ncountries are allowed to buy weapons\nof mass destruction from Britain, but\ncannot be trusted to make their own\nusing British know-how? Why is\nPakistan black-listed, for example, as\na country held firmly in the pocket of\nthe United States, do they pose a serious threat to British, or indeed\nWorld, peace? The present political\nunrest in Pakistan may amount to a civil war - is this the reason why\nfuture Pakistani students are subject\nto Government vetting? If the answer\nis yes, why is it that students from\nother countries experiencing civil\ndisturbances - for example Nigeriaare not also vetted?\nAlso, can it be fair to deny anyone\neducation on the grounds of their ethnic background; is Britain in a position to make such judgements?\nIn addition to this the effectiveness\nof such a procedure must be called\ninto question. Is it possible to judge\nthe terrorist tend an cie s of potential\nstudents given only such surface\ndetails as academic and employment\nrecords, especially considering that a person applying for a post in a British\nUniversity is highly unlikely to have\na criminal record or to have been\ninvolved in any documented\n\"affray\".\nThe Government's fears regarding\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons\nare not unfounded, however. In 1979\nan Iraqi Post-Doctoral student, who\nhad carried out research in ICs High\nEnergy Physics group, returned to\nIraq and established it's nuclear\nweapons programme. This is not the\nend of the story however; IC can still\nbe linked to this nuclear programme\nwhich does provide a risk to the rest\nof the world; the current leader of this\nprogramme is also an ex-IC student!\nIn the light of such evidence, the\nlast question posed by the vetting of\ncertain students must be: Do we have\na choice?\n\n"

    "content": "12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 1 7TH JANUARY\nLike shooting fish in a barrel. Such\nwas my reaction to reading Friday's Felix and planning this week's col-um n.I almost feel guilty about how\neasy this is to write. When you have\nquotes like 'College hasn't shot itself\nin the foot; just maybe shot the\nUnion', one feels tempted to ignore\nthe bookstore issue and pick something more challenging. My job is\nnot to do the Union's bidding, nor\nanyone else for that matter, but I have to say that the bookstore tendering process leaves a soup \u2022 on to be\ndesired. My concern is that we get a good bookstore and the College, and\nthus the taxpayer, gets a good deal. I must say that either Waterstone's or\nthe Union would satisfy the former.\nThe good deal question is not so clear\ncut.\nProfessor Alan Swanson, a key\nfigure in the proceedings is on the\nrecord as saying 'another group of\npeople might have made a different\ndecision.' This does not fill me with\nconfidence. A word to the wise,\nAlan: don't let the National Audit\nOffice catch you using phrases like\nthat, it makes them very twitch y. It\nimplies a myriad of undesirable practices, most of which I shall refrain\nfrom mentioning since I rather fancy\nfinishing my PhD. I 'll play Devil's advocate and suggest that an auditor\nwith a keen fiscal nose would say\nthat this implies incompetence, a failure to select the bid that was indisputably in the best interests of the\nCollege/taxpayer. If a local council\ndid this, councillors could find themselves surcharged, as has happened\non several occasions. It has also been\nbeen stated by Prof Swanson that the\nCollege will make up the Union's loss. The lost profit is put at \u00a370,000.\nThe rent for the new bookstore is\n\u00a360,000. In addition, IC will take 3%\nof gross sales. The current bookstore\nhas a turnover of\n\u00a31 million.\nAllowing for\nsome expansion in\nbook sales and\ndeduction of stationery and other\nlines not provided\nby Waterstone's,I would imagine the\nfigure to be \u00a30.9 to\n\u00a31 million. Total\ntake by College\nequals \u00a385,000.\nStrip out the\n\u00a370,000 pledged to\nthe Union and you\nhave \u00a315,000\nper year A VOlCC OI\nprofit for the\nCollege, you cry. Makes a pleasant\nchange, you say. But let's not forget\nthat you still have the Union book-store, albeit not selling academic\nbooks, occupying a prime site on the\nwalkway. Had ICU won, the College\nwould have received \u00a360,000 rent\nand presumably the cut of the sales.\nThey would also have freed up a second retail site, ideal for the proposed\ntransformation of the walkway.\nBaker The College may well say that it\ndoubted the Union's ability to cover\nthe rent, but this ignores the broader\nremit that they have over\nWaterstone's. WH Smith, under their\nnew chief executive Bill Cockburn,\nare anxious to boost margins and\nrefocus a vast undisciplined product\nrange group-wide. This is wholly\nlaudable- you\nwouldn't expect\nme to come out\nagainst the notion\nof shareholder\nvalue. This all\nmeans that you\nwon't be buying\nyour bir os and\nMagnapads in the\nnew bookstore.\nThe Union, how-ever, could sell\nanything incidental to academic\ntexts, and the\nexpanded premises and a little\nmore of the\nmanagement\nacumen that turned the existing outlet from a Sherfield-run loss-maker,\nfor which you will never be forgiven,\ninto a nice little earner, would easily\nenable this. Existing lines could be\nexpanded and floor space could be\ngiven to new products. Don't get me\nwrong, Waterstone's will offer a first-rate bookstore, like their other\nbranches; the \"powerful\" IT investment is a bit of a mystery, though.\nReason Don't think that I 've been got at by\nthe Union. ICU does a good job, but\nis far from perfect. Yes, the Ents\nlounge refurbishment was a great\nsuccess, but the money spent on\nDaVinci's was farcical. In its\ns tri vance to be democratic, it has\nmore committees than the EU, which opens it up to the influence of\npeople who like the sound of their\nown voice more than is helpful. Give\nthe Sab's more power I say. On the\npositive side, it makes a lot of money\nfor us through its trading activities,\nhas a huge number of supported\nclubs and societies (too many some\nwould say) and about the only weekly student newspaper in the country.\nTrying to 'shoot' it just as IC is about\nto expand seems very short-sighted,\nand a move that looks set to be a net\ncost to the College, precisely the\nopposite of what they were trying to\nachieve. They'll get it right one day,\nwon't they?\nThis has all taken up more space than\nintended, so no time to mention the\ngrant cheques fiasco, of which I was\na victim, other than to question Tony\nCullen's comment 'not least the stu-dents' being affected. Who else, for\nGod's sake? I promise I shall get all\npolitical on you next week after far\ntoo long a gap. Oh, and for the final\ntime, it is NOT compulsory to sleep\nwith boys or wear stockings to be a Conservative MP. The subject is\nclosed.\nPersonally Speaking\nHappiness is not a human condition.\nThis is the big mistake people make.\nTelevision and other media try hard\nto convince us of the contrary, but I doubt there is one person reading\nthis article that considers themself\ntruly happy with their lot. Whether it\nbe discontent nie nt with the course,\ntrouble with relationships, crises of\nconfidence in the way you look,\ndress or act, personal tragedy, ill-ness, financial worries or whatever\npeople find to disquiet themselves,\nhappiness is at best a transitory experience, at worst a concept as alien as\ncheese and marmalade sandwiches.\nOne thing we tend to exchange for\nhappiness is hope or optimism, failing that, psychological drugs of a more tangible form. But when that is\ngone, what is left? Do you hope for\nhope? It seems that the pessimists of\nthe world have got it right; that's probably why they call themselves\nrealists.\nMy theory on the Universe has\nbeen reinforced over the last few\nweeks. It states\nthat the\nCartesian God\nis not one that can be viewed as good\nor bad, only indifferent. I believe that\nthe way that physical reality fits\ntogether, interrelates, and indeed\nexists, can be seen as proof of some\nkind of creative and infinitely powerful force. The laws of the interactions between space/time and\nmass/energy are what creates and\nsustains the Universe; it is the creator\nof these laws to whom we should\nrefer to as a God.\nAnd there seems very strongly\nindeed that there is no part of these\nlaws which relate to the human senses of justice, morality or happiness,\nand thus no innate justice, morality\nor happiness exists in the way the\nUniverse works, only indifference.\nBut, because it is the human wont\nto expect, demand and strive for hap-pines s, justice and goodness, we are\nnecessarily going to be disappointed,\nas there is all too yawning a chasm\nbetween our desires and this grim\nreality.\nJonathan Trout has not got a girlfriend.\nFELIX needs: |\nnews reporters\nfeature writers\nsports editor\nsports reporters\nillustrators\ndesigners\ntheatre reviewers\nbook reviewers\nfilm reviewers\npuzzle compilers\ncome in and see\nus in the corner H\" w?? f3Es it'/' TM ML mB of be it quad.\n\n"

    "content": "14 LETTERS & EDITORIAL FELIX FRIDAY 17TH JANUARY\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nreplied to by David Roberts\nBookstore: too little,\ntoo late\nDear Felix,\nLike many other people I am\ndeeply concerned about the effects\nthat closing the ICU bookshop will\nhave. I notice that the new\nWaterstones bookshop is to sell sec-on d hand books... what will happen\nto the excellent second-hand bookshop which is run as a non-profit\nmaking service by staff in the\nphysics department? I find it hard to\nbelieve that Waterstones would pay a student the cash value of a used text-book, and then sell it on for exactly\nthe same price.\nI am also concerned about the fate\nof the ICU newsagents - it has been\nmentioned that the new Waterstones\nwill be the only retail outlet on campus allowed to sell books, but what\nabout magazines, papers, greetings\ncards and stationery? If college\nauthorities are genuinely concerned\nabout minim ising the losses to the\nUnion, they will allow the\nNewsagents to expand into the \"old\"\n(at the moment, current) bookshop,\nand allow them to continue selling\nnewspapers, magazines, snacks and\nchemist goods as at present, and\nallow them to extend their range to\ncover the stationery items and greetings cards currently sold by the\nbookshop. If Waterstones is to take\nover the newsagents as well, I for one\nwould seriously consider a boycott.\nAnd I'm not a particularly political\nanimal.\nYours sincerely,\nHelen-Louise Windsor\nDear Mr Feakes,\nHow is it that your paper only\nreports important issues (ie. your\nrecent mournful piece about the closure of the Union Bookstore) when\nthey are dead and buried? Though it\nis generally made out that all us IC\nstudents are extremely apathetic, I, for one, would have protested very\nstrongly against the tender of the\nbookstore going to someone other\nthan our Union...but I didn't know.\nSurely, your job is to keep the student body of this college well-informed....in advance.\nYours sincerely,\nJoseph Sorenson\n(See editorial, right)\nDear Felix,\nI'd like to express my c once r rn at\nthe reported closure of the Union\nBookstore. I agree with the ICU centre pages {Felix 1074) \"The First\nNail in Your Union's Coffin?\" I found this article to be a purely negative one however....the question is\nsurely \"How can we turn this\naround?\" The Union will have my\nfull support in actions opposing the\nclosure.\nYours Sincerely,\nGeorge Constantinides\nFor once campus opinion would\nappear to be of one mind, with the\nclosure of the Union Bookstore\nuniversally condemned. This\nstrong feeling now needs to be\nturned into action, to ensure that\nother Union retail outlets - notably\nDa Vinci's and the Newsagentsdo not befall the same fate, leaving\nUnion funding totally at the discretion of College. After all, if you\nwere trying to attract overseas stu-dents, would you rather spend\nmoney on refurbishing dB's or on\nprestige groups like the boat club? IQ needs you\nDear St Mary's, The point of this letter is to sell\nourselves to you and to get as many\nof you to come as possible.\n\"Ourselves\" are IQ (Imperial\nQueers), the lesbian gay and bisexual society at IC, and we'd like to see\nmore of you medics. This term,\nwe've got a speaker from Stonewall\ncoming, and video evenings and\nnights out planned. You've already\nmissed our pub crawl, and last\nTuesday we had a blinding party at\ndB's, with all the other London university gay socs. Our regular meetings are on\nTuesday evenings at 7.30pm in the\ncharmingly titled Brown Committee\nRoom, on the top floor of the Union\n(in Prince Consort Road).

Letters may be e mailed to our address:\nfelix@ic.ac.uk\nFfU.r x Student Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Fe a kes/ Advertising Manager Mark Baker BOOKSTORE COVERAGE\nIt was not my original intention to\nweight the content of last week's issue so heavily in favour of the\nevents surrounding the Bookstore\ntender, but with the addition of the\nUnion's advert it was unavoidable.\nHowever, it does seem to have elicited a response, not only from those\nwhom have written letters, but also\nin a number of people who have\napproached members of the Union\nstaff to express their sympathy.\nIn answer to Joseph Sorenson's point (see letter, left) that there\nshould have been more coverage\nbefore, rather than after the event, I would say that it is easy to be wise\nwith hindsight. This is something\nthat ourselves at Felix, and the rest\nof the Union, should have pursued;\nhighlighting the repercussions of not\nwinning the tender (and the benefits\nof being successful), and generally\nraising the Union's members'\nawareness of what the Union actually does.\nThis obviously didn't happen.\nThe Union's approach to the tender\ncould be described as \"play by their\n[the College's] rules, and hopefully\nthey will make the right choice [ie,\nus]\", though I should stress that I have no idea what their actual policy\nwas, it merely seemed \"softly, soft-ly\" (though again this could be with\nthe benefit of hindsight). As for\nFelix, I can make the feeble excuse\nfor the news team that the ongoing\ntender negotiations were not really\n'news' as such. A new development\nor a shock revelation would have\nmerited column inches, but a dull\nreport that \"all is quiet on the\nBookstore Front\" would hardly have\nadvanced Felix's readers knowl-edge.\nAn investigative feature detailing\nthe pros and cons of the tender\nprocess, what would happen if we\nwon and what would happen if we\nlost would have been better. It would\neven have been interesting, perhaps.\nBut, unfortunately the time has past\nand now the Union must be forward\nlooking in its actions and trading\nactivities.\nOne last word on this subject. All\nof those who say that they would\nhave joined in any action that\nopposed the closure of the\nBookstore, to what lengths would\nyou have been prepared to go?\nFANTASY SABBATICAL\nLEAGUE\nIn the centre pages of this week's issue you may have noticed a bold\nfeature entitled \"Fantasy Sabbatical\nLeague\" offering prizes to the those\nwho can pick a winning combination of candidates in the forthcoming\nsabbatical elections (yes, it's that\ntime of year again).\nThis is not a joke feature, as some\npeople who have seen the concept\nthought. It is quite genuine, as are\nthe prizes; I'm sitting here now\noccasionally thumbing the tickets. It\nis meant to be a fun competition\nthough, similar to certain lesser\ngames run in other newspapers.

In the cold, dark chambers of the\ncomputer support services at IC, conversations turn to the so-called\n\"Millennium Bug\", now made infamous through the media bombardment it has received in the past few\nmonths courtesy of most leading\nbroadsheets.\nThe Millennium Bug is purported\nto arise due to the \"dd/mm/yy\"\n(day/month/year) date format used in\nmany computer systems, whereby\nthe date is displayed in a two digit\nformat. Thus, the year 1997 appears\nhire/rental) fines being charged for\ntitles on loan over the new year,\nincorrect interest calculations on\nloans and savings and discrepancies\nin computerised company accounts.\nAlthough this all sounds rather\napocalyptic, the reality is rather less\ndisastrous. Far fewer systems will be\naffected than the broadsheets would\nhave us believe, since many computers do not calculate the date in the\nsame way humans do. Rather, they\nstore the date in terms of the number\nof seconds since a set date, in many\ncases 1971. The year 2000 should\ntherefore have no effect on the com-put er's perception of the date.\nas \"97\" and the year 2000 appears as\n\"00\". Computer systems using the\ntwo digit date format may be unable\nto cope with 2000 and beyond,\nrecognising it as the year 1900\ninstead. This, it has been claimed,\ncan lead to many faults and anomalies appearing in otherwise stable\nsystems. These could, for example,\ninclude excessive library (or other\nThe real problems are more likely\nto arise in certain software packages,\nwhere the date is stored amongst\nother data, for example in a database.\nMore simple systems would both display and store dates, held in accounts\nfor example, as two digit numbers -producing the potential results men-tio ned. Many larger companies and\norganisations have already produced\nreports and begun to check their systems. Sadly, it appears that smaller\ncompanies are more likely to suffer,\nsince they do not have the financial\nor technical resources to draw from,\nin order to verify and adapt their systems if necessary.\nConcerned at the potential implications on Imperial (and whether,\nmore importantly, students living in\nhalls, could hope to see their rent\naccidentally waived), the bug is \"cer-tain ly being discussed\" by relevant\nauthorities at IC. Apparently, the\naccounting package currently in use\nwill \"probably\" be affected.\nHowever, this system is due to be\nreplaced \"around 1998\" and any\nreplacement will, by then, certainly\nbe able to handle the year 2000.\nTop-up fees threat\nUMBAR SALE EM The prospect of undergraduate students in the UK facing an annual\ncharge of up to a \u00a31,000 towards\ntheir college fees came closer after\nthe Russell Group of top universities\nadvised this month that some institutions would charge fees in the future.\nAt present, the government reimburses local education authorities for\npayment of university tuition fees,\nbut this form of higher education\nfunding may become a thing of the\npast. The Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England awarded universities \u00a33.1 billion for this academic\nyear, a \u00a30.4 billion decrease on 1995.\nWith increasing numbers of students\nentering higher education each year,\nmore universities are looking at top-up fees as a realistic option for\nobtaining necessary funds.\nImperial College had been reported in The Sunday Times to have been\namong those universities considering\ntop-up fees. The article stated that IC\nwould mention top-up fees being\ncharged in its 1998 prospectus. Dr\nRodney Eastwood from the\n[Financial] Planning department\ndenied this, insisting that \"IC currently has no plans to introduce top-up fees.\" He also explained that if\nCollege did introduce such a charge,\ndependent on government funding,\nmore mechanisms to offer students\nfinancial assistance, such as scholar-ships, awards and bursa ries, would\nbe introduced. Dr Eastwood also\nassured Felix that the financial status\nof prospective students would not\naffect their likelihood of gaining an\noffer.\nColleges that will be charging top-up fees are legally required to inform\napplicants prior to enrolment. The\nLondon School of Economics have\nalready warned undergraduates in\ntheir prospectus that they reserve the\nright to charge fees for tuition.\nUnion proposes C&S Resource centre\nPAUL SQUIRES\nImperial College Union is planning\nto build a new Clubs and Societies\nResource Centre to make administration of Clubs and Societies more efficient. The new Centre is likely to be\nin a refurbished Senior Common\nRoom, adjacent to the Union Office.\nIt is hoped that some of the money\nfor the project will be provided by\nthe Harlington Trust, a fund set up on\nthe proceeds from gravel extraction\non Imperial College's athletic ground\nat Harlington, near Heathrow. The\nTrust considers applications for\nfunding of various projects such as\nthis though in the past the fund has\nenabled the Union to purchase\nminibuses.\nThe reasoning behind the plans is\nfor the largely inadequate current\nfacilities for clubs and societies be\nupgraded to meet ICU's new Health\nand Safety policy's standards. The\npolicy requires ICU to undertake to\nprovide first aid training for at least\none member of each club and soci-e ty. The policy also requires that\nExternal Activities forms be completed before any trip may proceed,\nthat all potential hazards and dangers\nmust be assessed beforehand and that\ngroup leaders be better trained and\nmore experienced in general.\nIn order to meet such demands, the\nUnion requires more efficient fac ili ties. At present, only one computer in\nthe Union office is permanently\navailable for the use of clubs and\nsocieties. Departmental computing\nfacilities are inappropriate since they\nare primarily for academic usage and\npayment is required for print-outs of\nany material the club wishes to issue.\nThe new Resource Centre, however,\nwould contain many computers\nexclusively for clubs and societies.\nAnother reason for the plans is the\nchange to the structure of the British\nUniversity Sports Association's fixture listings. Previously inter-university sports tournaments were organised as block fixtures, in which universities would only play universities\nand hospitals only hospitals. The current BUSA system is a more complex league system, in which each\ninstitution has a ranking and fixtures\nare arranged accordingly, thus\nrequiring a more efficient system for\nsuch things as booking coaches for\naway matches. This side of administration is currently handled by the\nDeputy President for Clubs and\nSocieties, Sarah Corneille, but bookings are often made by other Union\nofficers, resulting in confusion. It is\nanticipated that the proposed\nResource Centre would employ a full-time administrator to handle\nsuch administrative matters allowing\nSarah Corneille to concentrate on her\nother duties.\nMs Corneille has high hopes for\nthe plans; \"It would both improve\nefficiency and bring different Clubs\nand Societies together more, hopefully breaking down the barriers and\nprejudices which sometimes exist\nbetween them.\"\n\n"

The decision means\nthat the Union will no longer be able\nto sell academic texts from its current\nSherfield walkway site, and may\nhave serious repercussions for the\nway the Union operates and the\nscope of its activities.\nDuring the meeting, student representatives from clubs, societies,\nConstituent Colleges and academic\ndepartments discussed the problems\nfacing the Union in the light of the\nloss of its largest trading outlet. They\nidentified the principle challenge to\nbe raising the Union's profile among\nIC's student population, and\nexpressed fears that many students\nmay be wholly or partially ignorant\nof the three key tenets of ICU's oper-ation. Firstly, the wide range of free\nservices, opportunities and activities\nthat the Union provides; Secondly,\nthe fact that campus facilities such as\nthe bars, disco, bookstore and catering in Beit Quad are managed by the\nUnion, and thirdly that the trading\nsurplus from these outlets is used to ,\nfund the Union's other services and\nactivities. By raising student awareness of these facts, the Union aims to\nincrease its trading activity and,\nmore importantly, mobil i sea body of\nopinion in order to protect its existing outlets against further attack.\nA variety of measures were suggested by members of the Council to\ntackle the problem, principally\nincluding a \"petition of concern,\"\nconsisting a standard letter to be\nsigned by students and presented to\nthe Rector. Further actions may\ninclude the re-naming of all clubs\nand societies, to include the word\n'Union'; IC boat club, for example,\nbecoming ICU boat club. In addition,\nthe Union may seek to 'brand'\ngoods, services and events in order to\nremind students that profits from\nthese outlets are reinvested in the\nCollege community. A campaign of\nposters and flyers around the cam-pus, and of letters to College governors is already being brought into\neffect.\nCouncil members fell short of convening a 'protest committee' or similar body, instead entrusting implementation of the new measures to\nICU's Executive committee, normally responsible for the Union's day-to-day running.\nStudent officials present at the\nmeeting conceded that there would\nbe little to be gained from any campaign targeted directly at Waterstone's or the new store itself.\nSpeaking to Felix, Piers Williams,\nICU Deputy President for Finance\nand Services, admitted; \"I don't think we're under any illusions as to\nthe r ever sibi lit y of the College's decision.\"\nAlthough traditional means of student protest, such as a strike or boycott of the new store, are unlikely to\nbe supported by Union officials, the\nstaging of events to attract national\nmedia attention has not been ruled\nout.\nIn Something for the Weekend: how to keep your New Years resolutions and a preview of\nft N lE's Brat Awards.

The PPO is\nresponsible for the production of IC\nReporter, the College's staff news-sheet.\nWorkers in the PPO have\nexpressed fears that they may have\nbeen \"blacklisted\" by thieves as this\nis the third time in six months that\nthey have been burgled, this latest\nincident putting the total loss at over\n\u00a337,000. The thefts may lie behind\ndelays in the release of the latest\nissue of the Reporter.\nSome sources claim this burglary\ncomes suspiciously soon after the\ncirculation of new pages of the internal telephone directory last week.\nThe same intruders may be responsible for all three break-ins and\nSecurity are investigating this alongside other possibilities.\nBurglars forced the door of the 5th floor office, very near to the Rector's Suite, and removed three computers.\nLinda Davies, Head of Press,\nPublications and Public Relations at\nIC, expressed her annoyance over the\ntheft. \"It's not only a waste of\nresources. It is extremely frustrating\nto be so disrupted, especially at this\ntime of the year when we are really\nstretched\" she said. PPO workers\nwere temporarily barred from the\noffice until police officers had taken\nfingerprints. However, when staff\nwere forced to return on Wednesday\ndue to work pressures, the Police had\nnot yet arrived.\nThis incident has intensified calls\nfor individual departments within the\nSherfield Building to be protected by\ntheir own swipe card entry systems.\nThe Rector's Suite already benefits\nfrom such a system.\nAddressing the effectiveness of\ncurrent security measures, Director\nof Estates Ian Caldwell admitted\n\"...obviously Sherfield is not as\nsecure as we might like... We are\nlooking at options, methods of pre-caution, sensor detectors and security camera networks.\"\nMr Caldwell explained the difficulties of incorporating an open,\nworking environment into a secure\nbuilding and confessed; \"odd bits of\npilfering go on all the time\"\n\n"

    "content": "16 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 1 7TH TANUARY\nFelix sport Christmas excesses fail to halt IC Hockey\nAfter an excess of pork-pies over the\nChristmas vacation, the slightly more\nrotund Mens 1st XI rumbled back\ninto form with a41 demolition of\nUCH in the London League. Despite\nthe adverse foggy, and an extra 2.4\ninches around the waist-band, IC\nstarted brightly and never looked\nback. An early goal mouth scramble\nresulted in Sid the Sexist netting for a10 lead. However, a momentary slip\nin our rock-like defence allowed\nUCH to equalise from a short corner.\nFurther IC pressure produced another\ngoal mouth epic, with Plasticman this\ntime benefitting from UCH's defensive ineptitude. This lead was not further increased before the half-time\nbreak.\nThe second period began in much\nthe same way as the first had ended,\nwith constant IC pressure. UCH were\nunable to withstand our overwhelming attacking talent, and eventually\nfolded. This allowed Indiana Jones,\nour ming er cum-ginger, to score his\nfirst goal for the College, courtesy of\nsome sloppy defending and several\ndeflections off his chest and chin.\nThere was no stopping the IC\nsteam-train now. Chicken Bol was\ndetermined that our supremacy\nshould continue. So he swapped his\nstick for an axe and produced the\nworst tackle seen anywhere - far\nmore suited to a Vinny Jones compilation video. Had it not been so\nFoggy, Basil (the bird behind the\nwhistle) would surely have sent him\nfor an early bath, but leniency was\nthe result, and only a green card was\nproduced. Undaunted, IC ravaged on,\nand despite several wasted chances,\nRent Boy fired in for a fourth goal\nfrom a short corner.\nThe performance as a whole was\nimpressive, with Porn-O always running around like a headless chicken,\nand the back four doing a sterling job.\nMention must be made of Golden\nBoy for occasionally roaring into the\nopposition circle, a phenomenon usually seen only when retrieving stray\nballs during the warm-up.\nThanks to Basil for coming along\nto peer through the gloom, and 2.4\ninches for deciding to watch a group\nof sheep molesters ahead of representing his College. Hopefully, he\ncan fit us into his social calendar for\nfuture away fixtures.\nMedals all round for IC fencing squad\nMost of the ICFC fencing team travelled up to Nottingham last weekend\nlooking for results in the individual\nchampionships. Last year IC fencers\nwon a gold and a bronze and made\ntwo other finals. The first weapon\nwas e pee, in which we had Eddie\nRysdale, Reuben Kalam, and Phil\nMiller competing. Eddie amazed\neveryone - including himself - beating two national level e pee is ts on his\nway to the final, which he lost 15-14.\nSaturday saw a strong men's team\nfor IC, and again Eddie made the\nfinal, this time winning the gold\nmedal with a1514 victory. Henry\nMorton was also a finalist. On the\nSunday, IC was defending the men's sabre title, but this year could only\nmanage one final place, thanks to Mo\nMansoori, who ended up seventh. So\noverall we came out better than last\nyear, with one gold, one silver and\ntwo other finalists.\nFull Results:\nEpee: Eddie Rysdale 2nd Reuben Kalam L32\nPhil Miller L32\nFoil: Linda Little L64\nVivian Ting L64\nDave Davidge 11th Henry Morton 8th Eddie Rysdale 1st Sabre Thorsten Meyer 10th Eddie Rysdale 9th Mo Mansoori 7th Sports Editor needed!\nIf you have some knowledge (and\ninterest) in sport and are ready to\ngive-up your Wednesday nights for\nFelix, then you are just the kind of\nperson we're looking for - so why\nnot drop into the office in the corner of Beit?\nFull training and regular cups of j coffee provided.\n\n"

    "content": "8 FANTASY SABBATICAL LEAGUE FELIX FRIDAY 1 7TH JANUARY\nThis year, for the first time, Felix brings you an unrivalled opportunity to share the success of next year's sabbaticals with Felix's Fantasy Sabbatical Ie ague \u2122.\nFor those not in the know, each year Imperial College Union holds a campus wide ballot to elect new sabbatical officers. There are four sabbaticals at ICU:\nPresident, Deputy President (Finance & Services), Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) and Felix Editor. They hold their position for year while taking\na break (a sabbatical) from their studies. During this time, each is ultimately responsible for running the services and performing the duties under their remit.\nThe sabbatical elections will take place in early March, however, the papers for nominations go up on February 3*. Any full member of Imperial College\nUnion may stand for any of the positions listed above. To be able to run for election, however, each nominee must have a proposer and twenty second ers, all\nof whom must also be full members of the Union. After the papers come down on February 14'\\ campaigning proper can start, and the 1996-97 sabbatical race\ncan begin. If you have any queries about the elections or wish to find out more about any of the posts, contact the President, Eric Allsop, via the Union.\nNow you too can join in the cut and thrust of the sabbatical race by playing Felix's Fantasy Sabbatical League\u2122. Read on, and you could be a winner!\nPrizes to be won!\nTo the winners, the spoils, to the losers, ignominy.\nFirst Prize: two return tickets to\nParis and a bottle of\nChampagne\nSecond Prize: \u00a3 3 0 of music vouchers\nOther prizes to be announced depending on stock\nACRONYM CHASER\nAAO Academic Affairs Officer\nACC Athletic Clubs Committee\nDcp Rep Departmental Representative\nICCAG Imperial College Community Action Group\nOSC Overseas Sub-Committee\nPub Board Publications Board\nSCAB Social and Cultural Amusements Board\nsee Social Clubs Committee\nRCC Recreational Clubs Committee\nRSC Refectory Services Committee\nThe aim of the game\nTM\nThe object of Felix Fantasy Sabbatical League is to predict the outcome\nof the 1997 ICU Sabbatical Elections. Using your skill and judgement,\nyou must choose which four people you think will be elected to each of\nthe four sabbatical positions, and which four will be runners-up (ie lose\nand come second). First and second place positions are simply determined by who wins most (and next most) votes in the eventual elections.\nTo win, you will have to guess not only who will be elected, but also who\nis likely to stand for election.\nIncluded opposite is a list of possible 'players.' These are people who\ncurrently hold positions on Council (the governing body of the Union)\nplus a few wildcard s. They are the people closely involved with the\nUnion whom we feel are most likely to stand for one of the four sabbatical positions. We have placed them in divisions, according to the seniority of their position within the Union, and assigned a points value to the\nplayers in each division. THE POSITION OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN\nTHE LEAGUE REFLECTS ONLY THEIR CURRENT STATUS\nWITHIN THE UNION: IT DOES NOT REPRESENT HIS/HER LIKELIHOOD OF STANDING OR BEING ELECTED.\nThere are two other 'players'; you should enter 'New Election' as a second choice for a position if you think that only one candidate will\nstand for that post, or if you think people would rather vote for a new\nelection than any of the candidates. If you think someone other than those\nincluded on our list will stand for a particular post, then include the\n'None of the above' player in the relevant place on your team. You do\nnot have to state who you think 'None of the above' will be. If 'New ele c tion' or 'None of the above' finishes in the place you have guessed, you\nscore the same points as if you had guessed an actual individual's result.\nRemember, you are strictly limited in the number of points you can\nspend on players, and so may not be able to field your first choice team...\nThis is where the element of chance comes in; Good luck!\nThe small print\n\u2022The closing date for entries is 5.00pm, Monday 3rd February.\n\u2022Competition results will be determined using 1997 ICU Sabbatical election results, as confirmed by ICU elections committee.\n\u2022The highest-scoring entry, as calculated by Felix, will be the winner. In the unlikely event of a tie, the winner will be the entrant whose original team had\nthe lowest combined points value. Failing this, the winner will be selected at random from those sharing the highest score.\n\u2022The competition is NOT open to the following groups of people:\n\u2022All those listed as 'players' opposite.\n\u2022Current sabbaticals.\n\u2022The Felix staff.\n\u2022Any unlisted 1997 sabbatical candidate.\n\u2022Anyone who is not a UG, PG or member of staff at Imperial College.\n\u2022Anyone acting on behalf of those above.\n\u2022The Felix Editor retains the right to declare the competition null and void at any time and to amend the rules without notice. Any change in rules will be\npublished in Felix.\n\u2022The results of the competition, and the points value assigned to each player shall have no bearing whatsoever upon the results of the election. Anyone suspected of contravening ICU sabbatical election rules, as laid down in the ICU constitution, may be subject to ICU disciplinary procedures.\n\n"
