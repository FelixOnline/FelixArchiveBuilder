It follows the story of Romy\nHill, a 29-year-old single mother serving two\nconsecutive life sentences for killing her stalker.\nC\nritics have unanimously acknowledged\nthe power of Esi Edugyan\u2019s tale of slavery\nand escape. The eponymous protagonist,\nWashington Black, was a slave on\na 19th\ncentury sugar plantation in Barbados\nbefore escaping and hopping from continent to\ncontinent, job to job. This is less a book about\nslavery than the burden, responsibility and guilt\nof personal freedom in a time of slavery, and later,\nThe Man Booker Prize 2018: a rundown of the shortlist\nThe Man Booker Prize is one of the most prestigious and closely-watched literary prizes in the world. The 2018\nwinner was announced on Tuesday, and goes to Anna Burns\u2019s Milkman. Felix Books editor Jingjie Cheng gives a\nrundown of this year\u2019s six shortlisted books.\nA\nnna Burns is the first Northern Irish writer to\nwin the coveted prize \u2013 previous Irish writers\nhave all been from the Republic. She is also\nthe first female writer to win since 2013,\nwhen Eleanor Catton won for The Luminaries. The\nBooker\u2019s chair of judges, philosopher Kwame Anthony\nAppiah, called her book \u201cincredibly original\u201d. Indeed,\nit is the most experimental of the shortlist. The story\nis narrated by an unnamed 18-year-old girl, known as\n\u201cmiddle sister\u201d, who is being pursued by a much older\nparamilitary figure, the\u201cmilkman\u201d.

It remains to be seen if Milkman\nbecomes widely popular, but it has certainly shaken\nthe conventions of genre.\nafter abolition. Based on a true story, this novel\nis as much of a page-turner as it is sensitive and\nambitious in scope. Edugyan was last shortlisted\nfor the prize in 2011, for Half Blood Blues, which\nwas about a black teenage music genius in Hitler\u2019s\nGermany. If the Booker is increasingly seen as\nlosing touch with what might be popular on\nthe ground, the shortlisting of this book proves\notherwise.\nMilkman, by Anna Burns\nKushner is well-researched, and describes prison\nlife with sensitivity and detail. This book is less\nabout the individual lives as a comment about\nthe American justice system, where no one has\nchoices and everyone is guilty, especially the poor\nand socially disadvantaged. Everyone is trapped\nin their circumstances.

Robertson is a celebrated Scottish\npoet, and The Long Take has the quality of an epic\npoem. It is a poetical fiction narrative of over\n200 pages modelled after the black-and-white\nHollywood films produced around the 1940s and\n1950s, such as Out of the Past and Kiss Me Deadly.\nE\nverything Under is Daisy Johnson\u2019s first\nnovel, and had she won, she would have\nbecome the youngest-ever winner of the\nprize.Shedidn\u2019t,butthisisstillanincredible\ndebut novel, a reworking of the Oedipus myth\nin the context of a troubled mother-daughter\nrelationship.

It was something of a bittersweet\nmoment for me. Although\nI was obviously extremly\nhappy to collect my\ndegree and finally see the\nfruits of four years' worth\nof hard labour, the day was\nalso tinged with extreme\nsadness. I couldn't stop\nthinking about one person\nthat should have been\nthere celebrating with us\nall; my close friend and\nthe strongest person I\nknow, Lauren Dennis.\nOn the evening of\nMonday 15th October,\nI was told of Lauren's\npassing after an 18-month\nbattle with bowel cancer\nand, if I'm honest, I\nhaven't been able to think\nof much else since. Lauren\nwas a Chemistry student\nat Imperial. I wanted to\ntake this opportunity to\ndedicate my editorial to\nher memory with a letter\nto Lauren:\nYoo Lauren, wys?\nI wanted to start this\nhow I started every conversation with you. Don't\nworry, I won't be sharing\nany memes this time.\nTo be honest, I'm still at\na loss for words. There\naren't any words that can\ndo you justice, nor are\nthere words to describe\nhow I'm feeling right now\nbut it's somewhat cathartic\nto put what's in my head\ndown on paper. It doesn't\nreally feel real. It was less\nthan two weeks ago that\nwe were planning how\nto celebrate graduation\nand you said you would\nuse it as \"motivation to\nimproving fam\". Even\nwhen I came up to visit\nyou in hospital in Wolverhampton last Tuesday\nafter you called and let me\nknow the doctors had said\nthe cancer was terminal,\nI was almost certain the\ndoctors had got it wrong.\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed \u2013 we\u2019ll teach\nyou everything you need to know. If you\u2019re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk\nHow could someone have\nthe strength to keep that\nbeaming smile on their\nface at all times? How\ncould someone going\nthrough so much still\ncare enough to ask me\nhow my day was going?\nOr how the next issue of\nFelix was coming along?\nIf you were here today, I'd\nprobably be complaining\nabout the parking ticket\nI got this morning while\nyou laughed, saying\nsomething like, \"Read the\nsigns Andy...\"\nYou touched so many\nlives and you will be\nsorely missed by everyone\nwho had the pleasure\nof knowing you.

I will\nforever be grateful and\nblessed to have been able\nto call you a friend. Thank\nyou for allowing me to get\nclose to your family and\nfriends, who are some of\nthe most amazing people\nI'ver ever met. Thank you\nfor everything.\nThe world was lucky\nto have you.

You may want\nto think twice...\nH\ney, could you\nplease grab a\nGreek yoghurt\nwhen you\u2019re in\nTesco? Just make sure it\u2019s\nthe low-fat one - thanks!\u201d\nSound familiar?\nNowadays, we\u2019re constantly surrounded by a\nmyriad of fat-free, low-fat\nand reduced fat products\nas the food industry\u2019s\nattempt to maximise\nprofits gains momentum \u2013\ntaking a toll on our health.\nBut why? Weren\u2019t we\ntaught that the less fat you\neat, the more weight you\nlose, while reducing saturated fat improves cardiovascular health? In theory,\nkind of. In practice, with\nall the emerging products\non the market promising\na \u2018healthier lifestyle\u2019,\nthis turns out to be more\nof a misconception than\nsomething to preach.\nThe first problem is the\ndifference between the\ntypes of labels (who am\nI kidding, does anyone\ncare about wording when\nyou want whipped cream?\nAnyway, read on to find\nout).\n\u2022 \u2018Reduced fat\u2019 foods -25% less fat than the\nregular counterpart\n\u2022 \u2018Low-fat\u2019 \u2013 less than\n3g of fat per serving\n\u2022 \u2018Fat-free\u2019 \u2013 less than\n0.5g fat per serving\nLabelling can hence\nbe extremely misleading\n\u2013 take cream cheese, for\nexample. A reduced fat\none still contains more\nthan 3% of fat (and thus\na high fat food), but we\nbuy it, thinking it\u2019s a lean\nchoice.\nNext: what do these\nmodified foods really\ncontain? Since the fat\ncontent is limited, they\nmust be prepared differently than the original.\nA common technique is\nreplacing animal fats with\nunsaturated vegetable\noils; sounds healthy, right?\nHowever, their structure\nis often altered in order\nfor their properties to suit\nthe product\u2019s purpose, in a\nprocess called hydrogena-tion.\nThis greatly increases\nthe levels of trans-fats:\nthe unhealthiest kind due\nto their artificial nature\nand lack of potential to be\nutilised in the body.\nYou may be wondering\nwhy modified products\nstill taste good \u2013 after all,\nflavour is eliminated.\nWell, to keep the food\nedible, sugar levels are\namped up like crazy in\nreduced fat products.\nThis results in not only\na potentially higher\ncalorific content, but also\nin elevated blood sugar\nlevels and subsequent\nrisk of type II diabetes or\ncardiovascular disease.\nVarious additives and\nchemicals may also be\nincorporated. So much for\n\u2018healthy eating\u2019.\nThe simplest argument\nfor avoiding these\nproducts is that fats\n(despite all those Daily\nMail rumours), are\nactually good and neces-sary, as long as they\u2019re the\nright type.\nHealthy fats provide\nessential fatty acids such\nas omega-3 or -6, which\nare used for making cell\nmembranes, hormones,\nneurons in the brain and\ncentral nervous system,\nand more. Ingestion of\nthese is vital because\nthe human body cannot\nsynthesise these itself, so\nif you\u2019re trying to lose\nweight this way, you\u2019re\nlosing your mind. Literally.\nThe conclusion? Read\nthe label before you buy\nmodified fat options to see\nwhat it is being replaced\nby, and decide whether\nit\u2019s worth it.

Glenn Close, as\nthe eponymous \u201cWife\u201d\nproves to be the most\nstunning and transcendent\nfeature of the film.\nAs opposed to Frances\nMcDormand\u2019s explosive\nperformance last year\nwhich won her an Oscar,\nGlenn Close in The Wife\nportrays a collected and\ninternal character. Joan\nArcher has a very conflicting personality. She is\nregularly shunned aside as\n\u201cthe wife\u201d, both publicly\nand domestically. \u201cI am\na kingmaker,\u201d she says\nwithout hesitation. She\nnever doubted her own\nability and she knows that\nher husband will never\nhave a career without her,\nand she wants to be recognised for that (\u201cEveryone\nneeds approval,\u201d she tells\nher husband). However,\nat the same time, her love\nand respect for her spouse\nbecomes an obstacle for\nher. When Nathaniel\nBone (Christian Slater),\nthe journalist who keeps\ntrying to persuade Joan\nto let him write about her\nhusband\u2019s fraudulence,\nshe firmly forbids him.\nThis may be testament to\nher unwavering respect\nfor her husband\u2019s legacy,\nor she simply does not\nwant to be in the spotlight.\nIn any case, she struggles\nto gain the approval she\ndoes not know she needed\nuntil her husband gets a\nNobel Prize. Glenn Close\ndelivers this dissonance\nof emotion very clearly\nthrough a calm facade.\nAnd that\u2019s the brilliance\nof her performance,\nbecause despite all the\nsuppressed emotions, the\naudience never fails to understand her. Her presence\nis like waves which grow\nin magnitude as the film\nprogresses until it builds\nup into a tsunami and all\nthe suppressed energy is\nreleased volcanically in an\nemotional and absolutely\nenthralling finale.\nThat is not to undermine the rest of the cast\nand crew. Jonathan Pryce\nis great as the narcissistic husband, and Max\nIrons, who plays the son\nof Joseph Castleman,\nportraying an aspiring\nwriter with desperate need\nof a father\u2019s approval\nwith quite some shining\nmoments. Together, the\nentire cast\u2019s performances\ncreate a very engaging\nchemistry which successfully carries the film\nthrough its slower and\nmore dragging parts.\nIn terms of the direc-tion, for me, the camera\nis mostly a relatively\npassive and conservative\npresence, which in my\nopinion augments the performances and captivation\nof the film. Especially\nat times when the story\nseems to wander a bit,\nputting Glenn Close at the\ndead centre of the frame\nis a very correct choice.\nBecause her dedication to\nthe character and meticulous performance alone\nis enough to provide the\nfilm a burst of momentum\nfor it to hit its final high\nmark.\nMasters of the Melancholic Movie Music\nA\nmonth ago, in\nthe throes of\nfeeling ill and\nin the dumps, I\nturned not to Netflix but\nmy old DVD collection.\nAfter wiping away the\ndust and sifting through\nthe selection, I found,\ntightly tucked at the back\nof the drawer, a bunch of\nDVDs all created by the\nmost celebrated Japanese\nanimation studio.\nAt some point in your\nlife I\u2019m certain you\nwill have seen or heard\nabout a Studio Ghibli\nmovie, most likely\nSpirited Away or Howl\u2019s\nMoving Castle. They are\nincredibly well-crafted\nstories with exceptionally\nbeautiful visuals and\ncharacters you\u2019re immediately invested in. I still\nremember being dragged\nalong to a showing of\nSpirited Away by my dad\nand becoming hooked.\nI pop in the first DVD,\nthe title comes up and it\nhits me like a train. That\nmelancholic feeling in my\nchest warms just from the\nmusic in the title screen.\nAs the movie goes on I\nrealise that despite it being\nyears since I\u2019ve seen it,\nthe music is still burned\ninto my memory. At one\npoint I even muted the TV\njust be sure, the moment\nthe music left the feeling\ndid too.\nThe mastermind behind\nthe studio\u2019s scores is\nJoe Hisaishi. He\u2019s had\na lifetime of awards for\ncomposition and musical\ninfluence, including\nwinning the Japanese\nAcademy Award for Best\nMusic seven times.\nThe beauty of Hisaishi\u2019s scores stems from\nthe motifs he crafts and\ntheir constant appearance\nat just the right moments.\nThe motifs always\nmanage to perfectly match\nthe theme of the story and\nchange in their intensity\nand tone as the characters\ngo on their journey.\nIf it\u2019s a story about a\nwoman breaking past the\nexceptions society has of\nher, then the score is a\nwaltz \u2013 perfectly representing the dance she is\nstuck in where she does\nnot lead. Then in her most\npowerful moments the\nscore swells with a full orchestra behind it demonstrating her newly found\nstrength. Or a story about\na boy having to triumph\nover an evil he doesn\u2019t\nunderstand. Start with\nthe motif being dark and\nsinister and as the movie\nprogresses have it become\nlight and triumphant.\nI\u2019ve specifically not\nmentioned any names of\nthe films I\u2019ve seen because\nthey are all exceptional.\nThis is just my opinion\nso I encourage you to go\nwatch one for yourself,\nand you may even feel\nmelancholic despite never\nhaving seen one before\n(true review from my\nmate Liam).\nI watched all the\nmovies I had on DVD\nand by the end, the warm\nmelancholic feeling was\nalmost like a burning. So\nmuch emotion is packed\ninto so few melodies and\nthemes. The simplicity\nand power is exactly\nwhy over a decade from\nmy first viewings I still\nremembered every last\nnote, and I\u2019m sure that\nanother decade from now,\nI still will.\nFILM\nAidan Chan\nFilm Editor\nFILM\nGuthrie Ruby\nFilm Writer\nThe Wife// IMDb\nSpirited Away // IMDb\n\u201c...all the\nsupressed\nenergy is\nreleased\nvolcanically in\nan emotional\nand absolutely\nenthralling\nfinale\u0007\u201d\n\u201cThe motifs\nalways\nmanage to\nperfectly\nmatch the\ntheme of the\nstory and\nchange in their\nintensity and\ntone as the\ncharacters\ngo on their\njourney\u201d\n\n"

When the authorities threaten to close down\nthe hospital in order to\nconcentrate resources and\nservices, she finds herself\ncampaigning against\nits closure, becoming\nsomething of a national\ncelebrity in the process.\nShe succeeds, the hospital\nis saved, and now as an\nangel of the NHS, Pauline\nfinds a political career\nbefore her, first becoming\nan independent MP and\nthen considers running for\nLabour leadership.\nThis, however, is\ncomplicated by Pauline\u2019s relationship with\nan old boyfriend from\nuniversity, Jack Gould,\nwho has worked his way\nto material comfort as a\nlawyer, become an MP,\nand is now also eyeing\nthe Labour leadership.\nTheir divergent paths\nand on-and-off fraught\nrelationship is the vehicle\nfor many an exposition\nabout the issues raised in\nthe play.\nI\u2019m Not Running is\nDavid Hare\u2019s 17th new\nplay for the National\nTheatre, a thinly-veiled\nparallel universe that\ncomments on and sometimes satirizes the current\nstate of British politics.\nWith wide-ranging issues\nsuch as the state of the\nNHS, single-issue politics,\nthe Labour party, domestic\nabuse and feminism all\njostling for attention in the\nplay, watching it felt like\na quick browse through\ntoday\u2019s newspaper.\nThe downside of addressing so many issues\nin two and a half hours\nis that inevitably, each\nissue is not explored\nsufficiently. For a play\nthat is so overtly political\nand puts a touchy political\nsubject \u2013 the direction of\nthe NHS \u2013 at its centre, it\nis disappointingly shallow\nin its portrayal of these\nissues and is one-dimen-sional in its commentary.\nIt is happily assumed that\nsaving a small provincial\nhospital with limited\nresources is the right thing\nto do, when there are, in\nfact, many good reasons\nto concentrate specialist\nresources in healthcare.\nThese were hardly mentioned in the argument\nbetween Jack and Pauline,\nwhere Jack raises only\nsimplistic economical\nreasons for his support of\nthe hospital closures.\nOther issues were only\ntouch and go, which made\nthe play feel like it lacked\ndirection and was trying\nto take on too many things\nat once. It is hinted that\nthere was some violence\nin Jack and Pauline\u2019s relationship back in univer-sity, and some domestic\nabuse between Pauline\u2019s\nparents. Meredith, a polit-ically-conscious aspiring\njournalist, has an extended\nconversation with Pauline\nabout female genital\nmutilation. These are\nimportant issues, which\nmeans that throwing them\nin without further exploration seemed cursory,\nand detracted from the\nfocus and momentum of\nthe play.\nWhat the play did have\ngoing for it, however,\nwas the characterisation\nof Jack and Pauline\u2019s re-lationship, and their individual characters. One of\nthe earlier scenes, of when\nthe two were arguing in\na university dormitory\nroom, was perhaps one of\nthe more sensitive ones in\nthe play. We get a sense of\nhow emotionally guarded\nPauline is, her difficult\nrelationship with her alcoholic mother, and Jack\u2019s\ntendency towards control.\nAs their paths diverged,\nwe see Pauline standing\nfor her principles, headstrong and stubborn, while\nJack strives for material\ncomfort and an outward\ndisplay of stability and\n\u2018perfection\u2019. \u201cI love my\nwife very much and she\nis perfect,\u201d he declares,\nright after sleeping with\nPauline while his wife\nwas away.\nSian Brooke does a\ngood job as Pauline,\nbringing out her transformation from idealistic university student to realising\nthat in order to change\nthe world, she has to\nstep into partisan politics\nherself. Alex Hassell is\nslightly affected as Jack,\nbut Joshua McGuire puts\non a strong performance\nas Sandy, Pauline\u2019s loyal\npress secretary and the\nonly easily likeable character in the play.\nIt seems to me that\nthe concrete issues of the\nplay and the interpersonal\nrelationships portrayed\nare two distinct matters \u2013\nit does well painting the\ncharacters but falls short\nin exploring the issues\nthey are embroiled in with\nany insight. The character\ndevelopment, which is\nfairly well done, fails to\nintegrate itself seamlessly\ninto the political commen-tary, which is a shame.\nTherearealsosomescenes\nthat are curiously improb-able, such as Meredith\nsuddenly having a heart\nattack mid-conversation\nwith Pauline due to a\ncongenital heart condition\nthat no one knew about\nbefore. She dies, which is\nalso curious considering\nsomeone of her young\nage, right next to a qualified doctor, should be the\nexact kind of candidate\nfor successful CPR.\nI\u2019m Not Running is a\nplay that tries to do too\nmuch all at once. While\nthe cast is strong and the\ncharacters relatable, its\nskirting over a wide range\nof political issues does it\nno favours. The result is\na structure that has too\nmany weakly-related\ncomponents for its own\ngood, lacking momentum\nand focus.\nI\u2019m Not Running will\nbe broadcast by National\nTheatre Live on 31\nJanuary 2019.\nToo many issues, too little time.\nSi\u00e2n Brooke and Liza Sadovy // National Theatre\nISSUE 1701\nFELIX\n21\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Writer\nWhere?

In her new\nstaging of Measure for\nMeasure at the Donmar,\nin which Hayley Atwell\nand Jack Lowden alternate their roles, director\nJosie Rourke sets to out to\nshow that some things are\nuniversal.\nDuring an evening\u2019s\nperformance, the stage \u2013\nwhich is dominated by a\nbackdrop of bars, recalling\nthe literal and metaphorical imprisonment of the\nplay\u2019s characters \u2013 is both\n17th\ncentury Vienna and\nmodern day London. We\nfirst meet the characters\nin 1604, the year of the\nplay\u2019s first performance.\nIsabella (Atwell), a young\nnun pleads with Angelo\n(Lowden), the recently\npromoted judge, for\nclemency on behalf of her\nbrother who has been sentenced to death for sexual\nmisconduct. Angelo, who\nhas a reputation of being\nan austere and pious man,\nagrees, but only if Isabella\nyields her virginity in\nexchange. At first her\nsaviour appears to be the\nDuke (Nicholas Burns),\nwho has promoted Angelo\nin order to test him. When\nthe Duke, disguised as a\nmonk, witnesses Angelo\u2019s\nabuses of power go un-checked, he is determined\nto thwart him using any\nmeans possible.\nThe character of the\nDuke is seen to be something of a divine intervention in most performances\nof Measure for Measure,\nbut here Rourke turns the\ncharacter on its head. We\ncome to realise, that far\nfrom being altruistic, the\nDuke only helps Isabella\nin order to ingratiate\nhimself with her and ultimately to hold his power\nover her. Having helped\nIsabella indict Angelo in\nopen court, he propositions her. Realizing that\nshe is once again trapped,\nher answer is a howl of\ndesperation and anguish.\nThe stunned theatre\nis pitched into darkness;\nwhen the stage lights flash\n\u201cCloisters\nbecome court-rooms, and the\nchains of office\nare metamorphosed\ninto red\nlanyards\ncarrying the\nkey cards of\npower\u201d\n\u201cThe modern\nretelling goes\nsome way in\nhighlighting\nthe plight of\nmale survivors\nof sexual\nassault\u201d\non again, Isabella has been\nreinvented as a deputy\nprosecutor in the modern\nday who is to be promoted.\nThe story is retold, with\nthe roles of Angelo and\nIsabella reversed; cloisters become courtrooms,\nand the chains of office\nare metamorphosed into\nred lanyards carrying the\nkey cards of power. Now\nit is Isabella \u2013 renamed\nIsabel \u2013 who has the upper\nhand and Angelo, a young\nChristian, finds himself as\nher victim.\nWhat this second half\nrole reversal is meant\nto highlight is a bit of a\nmystery. In some respects\nsion, the play is more than\na little muddled. In the\nperiod staging, the narrative is taut and incisive.\n\u201cWho will believe thee,\nIsabel?\u201d counters Angelo\nin one scene when Isabella\nthreatens to expose him.\nPresent day headlines\necho in those words. With\n#MeToo, Harvey Weinstein and the Kavanaugh\nhearings so fresh in the\npublic consciousness, the\nperformance feels very\ntimely. When left to draw\nour own modern parallels\nfrom the period setting,\nthere is far greater clarity\nof intent than when the\nnarrative is transposed to\nthe present day.\nThe modern retelling\ngoes some way in highlighting the plight of\nmale survivors of sexual\nassault. It\u2019s a subject that\nneeds tackling, a fact\nmade abundantly clear by\nthe audience\u2019s laughter\nat the scenes in which\nAngelo struggles to tell his\nbrother that he cannot give\nin to Isabella\u2019s demands\nto save his brother\u2019s life\n(the reaction to the same\nscene when it was Isabella\nwho was being exploited\nwas not so dismissive).\nYet the staging does not\ngo far enough \u2013 Angelo\nthe novice is never put\nin the same position of\npowerlessness as Isabella\nthe novice; we never hear\nhis howl of pain when re-her trial takes on a nasty\nmisogynistic edge when\na recording made without\nher permission of her\nhaving sex is uploaded to\nthe internet to humiliate\nher. Rourke brings up interesting questions about\nfemale rage, revenge and\nwhat it is to be a woman in\npower, but does not give\nthe themes enough space\nto develop.\nNevertheless, there is\nlittle fault to be found\nwhere the acting is\nconcerned. Atwell is a\ncommanding presence\nand even as the naive\nnovice, holds sway over\nthe stage. In both incarnations of Angelo, Lowden\nis splendid, his charm\ncurdling into sleaziness in\nthe first half, and cracking\ninto vulnerability in the\nsecond.\nRourke\u2019s staging is\na complex, immersive\nretelling. Even with its\nmissteps, it\u2019s well worth a\nwatch.\nRourke seems to be saying\nmen too can be victims of\nsexual assault, and that\npower corrupts irrespective of gender, though it\ncould be read as Isabella\u2019s\nrevenge fantasy \u2013 her\n\u201cmeasure for measure\u201d.\nI considered the former\nmore likely as I watched\nthe play unfold, but in\nhindsight the latter has\nseemed more plausible.\nIn either case, there is\nno getting away from the\nfact that after the intermis-The Modern World// Manuel Harlan\nalising that he has escaped\nthe deputy only to be\nexploited by the Duke.\nSimilarly Isabel the\ndeputy never commands\nthe same power as\nAngelo in the same role.\nHer juniors mock her,\nA Power Play// Manuel Harlan\nARTS\nIndira Mallik\nArts Writer\nWhere?

It has notched a\n4.1% annualized growth\nrate for Q2, which is\nconsiderably faster than\nthe 2% growth rate that\nhas been standard since\n2001. Then in mid-August\nUS stocks hit an all-time\nhigh as the S&P 500\nbroke its longest Bull run\nin history. Naturally then,\nthe Federal Reserve and\nmany investors became\nsceptical that this growth\nwas sustainable, and\nthat the US economy\nwas \u2018overheating\u2019. So,\nit didn\u2019t come as a surprise when The Federal\nOpen Market Committee\nincreased the Fed funds\nrate by 25 basis points\nto 2.25%. However, the\ndawning realisation that\nthe Fed could increase\nrates further was met\nwith anxiety. A ferocious\ngovernment sell off of\nsovereign bonds that\nstarted at the beginning of\nthis month, has started to\npinch at the equity markets\nas investors are worried\nabout the implications of\nhigher treasury yields.\nLast week what began as a\ngradual sell-off escalated\ninto a violent dive causing\nbrutal losses in Asia, in\nparticular the tech-heavy\nTaiwanese market, trickling through to Europe\nand then coming back\nto the US market again.\nAt the market close last\nThursday $1.7trn had been\nwiped off the S&P 500.\nCuriously, the emerging\nmarkets remained un-af-fected which is surprising\nas they have been battered\nby the rising strength\ndouble digit increases in\ninflation. Despite this this\ndoesn\u2019t mean investors\nshould completely exit\ntheir positions in EM\neconomies. Prices for EM\nstocks are plummeting\nto fresh lows and the\nbrave investor could\nfind a bargain. Equity\nvaluations are trading in\nexcess of 40% discount\nto the US market in term\nof P/E ratios according to\nMobius Capital Partners.\nThis may be the time as\nwell with the European\nbond market looking\nprecarious with the Italian\nyield crisis. The European\nCommission and Rome\nare currently in a spat and\nthe new Italian populist\ngovernment plans to run\na higher budget deficit.\nAfter officials agreed a\ndeficit target of 2.4%,\nbusting the 2 % maximum\nthat Finance minister\nGiovanni Tria said he\u2019d\naccept, yields on the\nItalian bond soared a\nwhopping 40 basis points\nto 3.3%. Consequently,\nInvestor\u2019s negative bets\non Italian government\ndebt have peaked, indicating that these new budget\nproposals have fuelled\nconcern. Filippo Lanza,\nchief investment officer\nat London based hedge\nfund Numen Capital, said\n\u2018Italian bonds are already\ndiscounting downgrades\nfrom Moody\u2019s and S&P\u2026\nThe market believes that\nthe government has set\na spread of 400bp as a\ntarget, but at 3235bp to\n350bp we expect to see\nshort covering as the\nmarket discounts the\ngame plan and we think\neventually a comprise will\nbe found between government and the European\nCommission\u2019.\nSo is an economic\ndownturn approaching.\nYes. Inevitably there will\nbe a market correction at\nsome point, whether that\ntriggered by the growing\nliabilities of governments\nor the effect of struggling\nemerging markets\nslumping world growth.\nHowever, currently I\nthink the market is strong.\nCentral banks have started\nto increase policy rates\nand we are beginning to\nreduce our dependence\nof quantitative easing,\nbut the greatest threats\nto the global economy is\npolitical. Ironically, the\nTrump administration is\nnot only the cause of the\nbooming economy but\nalso its biggest threat.\nBy imposing tariffs not\nonly on China but on\n\u201cEquity\nvaluations\nare trading in\nexcess of 40%\ndiscount to\nthe US market\nin term of P/E\nratios\u201d\nof the dollar and US\neconomy. EM fared well\nafter the financial crisis\nwhen record low treasury\nand Eurobond yields\nas well as programmes\nsuch as quantitative\neasing caused investors\nto flood money into EM\neconomies as they sought\nhigher returns. However,\nrecent tightening of US\nmonetary policy and the\nsubsequent rise in the\ndollar has caused money\nto flood out. Furthermore,\nwith the majority of EM\u2019s\nhaving debt denominated\nin dollars rather than the\nlocal currency, means that\nas the dollar strengthens\nit becomes harder and\nmore expensive to pay\nback their debt. This has\ncaused EM with large\ncurrent account deficits\n[a high dependency of\nforeign investment] and\nhigh external debt like\nSouth Africa, Turkey,\nBrazil and Argentina to\nsuffer considerably. So\nfar this year the Argentine\npeso is down 50% against\nthe dollar, the Turkish lira\nis down almost 40% after\nPresident Erdogan raised\neconomic tensions after\nhis controversial comments on interest rates\nwhich he called a \u2018tool of\nexploitation\u2019 making the\ncentral bank wait months\nto raise rates, despite\nFed will increase rates to an estimated 2.5% next year // Fortune\nEmerging market currencies are suffering from a strong dollar // Financial Times\nRising Fed rates puts pressure on markets\nits strongest allies it\nthreatens to break up\nglobal cohesion that is\nneeded to maintain a\nstable economy.\n\n"

As an ex-ample, this week featured\nan announcement that\nthe Brexit negotiations\nwill be extended, that\na Saudi journalist was\nkilled and two Royal\nannouncements. One\ncan only admire the\nmedia obedience as they\ndesperately chased any\nshred of story about our\nscaly overlords. At this\npoint the only image that\nadequately represents the\nBritish media would be\na man with his testicles\nnailed to his forehead\nas the Queen belabours\nhim about the face with a\ncricket bat, demanding to\nknow whether he put in at\nleast a page about Diana.\nFuck.\nIn case you didn\u2019t\nknow, the Royals are\nlizards.\nHow the fuck did it\ncome to this? At this point\nin time we have been\nobsessing over the mating\nrites of Princess Eugenie\nand faceless white guy\nno. 2779000. I mean, no\nnewspapers have talked\nabout the post-nuptial\nceremony where bride\nand groom sacrifice the\npoorest person in the land\nbetween them in an orgy\nof lizard related violence.\nWith the current high\nrates of homelessness, it\nis often hard to determine\nexactly who the poorest\nis, but compromises are\nmade. It is of course only\nthe financially poor that\nthe reptiles can consume\nin this way. If it were\nemotional poverty, Britain\u2019s CEOs would have\nsomething to worry about.\nHowever, as most of them\nare at least admirers of\nthe cult of Royalty, it is\npossible that they would\nnot object too much.\nAt the same wedding,\nas most of you are\nprobably aware, Meghan\nand Harry announced that\nthey will be expanding\nthe Royal bloodline by\nbeginning a brood of their\nown. No one really knows\nexactly how many eggs\neach Royal queen lays in\na single batch, but what\nis known is that only the\nstrongest survives each\nhatching, with the other\nhatchlings providing the\nfuel for it to reach it\u2019s\nfirst moulting. This is the\npoint where the official\nphotos are taken, as the\nreptile puts on its first\nhuman skin. A significant\namount of speculation\nhas been made as to the\nskin colour of the next\nRoyal baby. As always the\ncolour will mostly depend\non what other infants are\navailable. The Royal\u2019s\npreference for white skin\nmostly stems from the fact\nthat broods are hatched at\nthe exclusive private wing\nof St Mary\u2019s. The real\nquestion is what colour\nthe crest will be. Most\nRoyals seem to be born\nwith a brunette colour,\nexcept for Harry that has\na ginger skin and bone\nstructure. Although this\ncalls into doubt his noble\nlineage at least one thing\nis certain: he is a dangerous man-eating lizard.\nSome people might say\nthat this is a pure fantasy,\nand I am imagining things\npurely for my own gratifi-cation. Well, if there was\none thing that the Brexit\ncampaign taught me,\nit\u2019s that the electorate is\neasily fooled. Not me, not\nthis time.

Following a strong\ndefensive effort and a\nback, making it 10-5 at the\nbreak (I think).\nAfter SOAS took the\nlead early in the second\nhalf with a converted try,\nImperial found themselves back on the front\nfoot.

The majority\nof the information we\u2019ve\ngot here is straight from\nthe horse\u2019s mouth, in\nparticular the developers\nthemselves, with news\nof the game having over\n300,000 animations,\n500,000 lines of dialogue\nand 1000 voice actors for\nNPCs, suggesting that\nRDR2 has a good chance\nof being Game of the Year\nby sheer amount of effort\nput in.\nHowever, no matter\nhow much effort was\nput in, there are growing\nconcerns over how much\nstorage space this will\ntake up on the PS4 or\nXbox One, with rumours/\nleakers stating that the\ngame takes up over\n100GB of hard drive\nspace; so you may have to\nsay goodbye to 1/10 or 1/5\nof your console\u2019s storage.\nBut for such a blockbuster of a game it seems\nlike there\u2019s not going to\nbe many big name voice\nactors, with Rockstar\nco-founder Dan Houser\nstating \u201cWe don\u2019t bring\nin named actors anymore\nbecause of their egos\nand, most important of\nall, because we believe\nwe get a better sense of\nimmersion using talented\nactors whose voices you\ndon\u2019t recognize.\u201d .\nStory\nWith already so much\nbeing mentioned it\u2019s time\nto take a look at what\nthe single player has to\noffer, with Dan Houser\nalso stating that the final\nscript for RDR2 spans\n2000 pages and if the\ndialogue for additional\ncontent was included and\nstacked, the paper stack\nwould reach eight feet\nhigh (15cm taller than\nbasketballer Yao Ming).\nBut even better than this,\nRockstar recently released\na description of the plot:\n\u201cAmerica, 1899. The\nend of the wild west era\nhas begun as lawmen hunt\ndown the last remaining\noutlaw gangs. Those\nwho will not surrender or\nsuccumb are killed. After\na robbery goes badly\nwrong in the western town\nof Blackwater, Arthur\nMorgan and the Van der\nLinde gang are forced to\n\u201cDan Houser\nalso stating\nthat the final\nscript for RDR2\nspans 2000\npages\u201d\nflee. With federal agents\nandthebestbountyhunters\nin the nation massing on\ntheir heels, the gang must\nrob, steal and fight their\nway across the rugged\nheartland of America in\norder to survive. As deepening internal divisions\nthreaten to tear the gang\napart, Arthur must make\na choice between his own\nideals and loyalty to the\ngang who raised him.\u201d\nFeaturing a young\nJohn Marston in the gang,\nthe story does seem like\nit\u2019s going to be quite the\nrodeo. I\u2019ll see myself out.\nGameplay\nRDR2 brings back all\nthe gameplay elements\nyou loved from RDR\nand puts you into a much\ngrander expansive world\nto explore. We can only\ntease some of the new ad-ditions, but these reveals\nwill keep you waiting in\nanticipation.\nBe prepared to dive\nfully into this world as\nyou can play the game\nliterally through the eyes\nof Alex Morgan with\nthe first-person option.\nWith this feature you can\nappreciate the 200 species\nwhich will populate the\nworld as you try to hunt\nfor food or avoid getting\nbitten by a poisonous\nsnake.\nMerchandising\nSet to release for\nOctober 26th, RDR2 will\nbe released on PS4 and\nXbox One. Unfortunately\nthe game will not be on\nPC, so say goodbye to\nyour fantasy of using a\ntexture pack of Thomas\nthe Tank Engine on trains,\nwith the Biggie Smalls\nremix of its corresponding\ntheme. Teetering away\nfrom such a depressing\ntopic, the game will be\npriced at \u00a350 upon release,\nwith the special edition/\ncollectors edition being\npriced at \u00a375 which also\nincludes a special edition\nprinted map and various\nother content. There is\nalso an ultimate edition\nwhich is priced at \u00a390\nand contains a plethora\nof story mode and online\ncontent, along with a\nprinted version of the\nworld map and a steelbox\nversion of the game. But\nthe pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is\nthe Red Dead Redemption\n2: Collectors Box which\nincludes the game and is\npriced at \u00a3179.99 , which\nincludes a metal lockbox\nwith a lock and key, collectable challenge coin,\ndouble-sized puzzle, six\nshooter bandana, treasure\nmap, pin set, catalogue\nfrom ingame and collectable cards.\nControversy\nFor the fantastic content\nthat seems to be coming,\nthere are indeed some\nrising scares about the\npresence of microtrans-actions in RDR2 . Given\ntheir overabundance\nin Rockstar\u2019s previous\ngame GTA V, which has\nmade $6 billion off of\nits original $265 million\nbudget since its release in\n2013. Fingers crossed that\nthe game isn\u2019t a complete\ncash grab, however, considering recent news of\nhow much effort is being\nput into the story it\u2019s a\npossibility that the single\nplayer at the very least is\nlikely to be spared from\nmicrotransactions.\nMoving on from one\nproblem that is plaguing\nthe gaming industry to\nanother; Telltale as many\nknow, recently went\nbankrupt which resulted\nin the mass layoff of\nemployees many of\nwhich without severance\nand no payment for their\novertime! A similar fright\nwas given when Dan\nHouser tweeted a statement that included \u201cWe\nwere working 100-hour\nweeks\u201d, resulting in a\nmassive backlash as\npeople speculated that\nemployees were being\nforced to do overtime in\norder to finish the games\nbefore its release, similar\nto that of Telltale. Dan\nHouser promptly responded with a tweet, a section\nof the tweet reads \u201cAfter\nworking on the game for\nseven years, the senior\nwriting team, which\nconsists of four people,\nMike Unsworth, Rupert\nHumphries, Lazlow and\nmyself, had, as we always\ndo, three weeks of intense\nwork when we wrapped\neverything up. Three\nweeks, not years.\u201d, the\nrest of the tweet then goes\non to discuss how that\nthe 100 hour work weeks\nwere a decision made\npurely out of affection\nfor the series and by their\nown volition.\n\u201c300,000\nanimations ,\n500,000 lines\nof dialogue\nand 1000 voice\nactors for\nNPCs\u201d\nWhat\u2019s that coming over the hill? // Rockstar\n\n"

After all, you\ndon\u2019t notice if the water in\nyour sink has gone from\n35 \u00baC to 35.5 \u00baC when you\nare washing the dishes.\nBut half a degree is much\nmore important than what\nyou may think. It is the\ndifference between being\nable to save 25% of coral\nreefs or none at all. The\nfate of millions of people\nin the most vulnerable and\npoor regions of the world\nrely on half a degree. And\nwe are now surer than\never.\n1.5 \u00baC in the global mean\ntemperature compared to\npre-industrial levels, and\nthe feasibility of limiting\nthe increase to \u2018just\u2019 that\nvalue. The report also\nincluded as a terrifying\nreference the theorized\nimplications of the temperature increasing half a\ndegree more, to 2 \u00baC.\nWhat are the main\ndifferences between the\ntwo? Well, 1.5 \u00baC will be\nbad, but is pretty much inevitable at this point. 2 \u00baC,\nwhich isn\u2019t, would be cat-astrophic. For starters, we\ncan look at the probability\nof extreme weather events\n(i.e. droughts or torrential\nrains) occurring under the\ntwo temperatures. While\nthe exact figure could not\nbe calculated, scientists\nknow with high confidence that such events\nwould be much more\nfrequent if the world heats\nup to the higher tempera-ture. In more quantifiable\naspects of nature, it was\nalso reported that sea\nlevel, while still above\npresent level, would be 10\ncm lower under a 1.5 \u00baC\nwarming compared to a 2\n\u00baC warming. This would\nbe quite a difference for\nthe numerous inhabitants\nof many coastal com-munities, the difference\nbetween staying in their\nancestral lands or being\nforced to flee.\nSo, after understanding\nthe implications of all\nthis, what can humankind\ndo to avoid reaching the\nfeared 2 \u00baC warm? Well,\nwe would have to change\nour entire production\nmodel, our lifestyle and\nour consumption choices,\nin addition to embarking\nin profound changes to\nour infrastructure, all in\nthe span of less than 15\nyears. The report concluded that for the increase to\nbe stabilized around the\n1.5 \u00baC value, CO2 emissions will have to be cut\nto 55% of what they were\nin 2010 (!), transitioning\ninto a gradual phase out\nthat eliminates emission\naltogether by the time we\nreach the equator of the\nmillennium. If these plans\nare not carried out, it will\nbe impossible to stop at\n1.5 \u00baC without engaging\nin colossal projects of\ngeoengineering, like solar\nradiation managements,\nwhose potential side\neffects are not yet well\nunderstood. that our generation does\nnot resign to the fate of\na ruined planet, where\nmany species and ecosystems have been wiped out\nand hundreds of millions\nof people have become\nvictims of global warming\nor the conflicts provoked\nby it. What can you do?\nWell, the most important\nthing to remember is\nthat individual action,\nwhile important, won\u2019t\nbe enough to stop climate\nchange. So yes, it will\nhelp if you decrease your\nconsumption of meat\n(specially beef) and you\navoid using private cars or\nplanes. But you have to do\na lot more for it to make\na difference. You have to\nput pressure on your poli-ticians, especially in these\ndays as climate change\ndenialism has become\nthe standard position of\ngovernments of countries\nof the magnitude of the\nUSA. You have to demand\nthat further regulations\nare applied to companies,\nas 70% of all global emissions are caused by them.\nYou have to engage with\nyour friends, and family,\nand the wider members\nof society, and convince\nthem of threat that climate\nchange poses to all of that.\nThe transformation that\nwe will have to make in\nour lifetimes cannot and\nmust not be curbed by the\nactions of a few greedy\nindividuals. Because\nremember, the world is at\nwar, and our enemies are\npresently in power.\nRetreating glacier// Wikimedia\n\u201cThe fate\nof millions\nof people\nin the most\nvulnerable and\npoor regions\nof the world\nrely on half a\ndegree\u201d\n\u201cThe report\nalso included,\nas a terrifying\nreference,\nthe theorised\nimplications\nof the\ntemperature\nincreasing half\na degree more,\nto 2 \u00baC \u201d\nLast week, the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (an UN\naffiliated organism that\nmonitors climate change\nand its potential effects\non all aspects of human\nsociety) released a report\non the potential consequences that an increase of\n\u201cSo, after\nunderstanding\nthe\nimplications\nof all this,\nwhat can\nhumankind\ndo to avoid\nreaching the\nfeared 2 \u00baC\nwarm?\u201d\nScary, isn\u2019t it?

These include the\npositive carbon feedback\nas the retreating Arctic\nice releases millions of\ntonnes of methane to the\natmosphere, or the melting\nof Siberian permafrost.\nSome studies suggest that\nwe may already be too late\nto avoid that, which would\nlead to an outcome where\na 2 \u00baC increase would be\nthe optimistic scenario.\nBut one cannot lose\nhope.

To create is to\nliberate. To break rules is\nto break free. Bach should\nbe terrified of Ornette\nColeman, and I\u2019d reckon\nChaplin would be dizzy\nafter a Harmony Korine\nfilm.\nAmbient music exists\nat the very end of the\nspectrum, and by definition alone, it is fiercely\npost-modern and non-mu-sical in every traditional\nsense. Coined by Brian\nEno, it disposes of structure and composition in\nfavour of features it deems\nmore important, such as\ntexture and atmosphere.\nBizarrely, such an obtuse\nform of music would\nbecome near ubiquitous\nas it got relegated to the\nfunction of background\nmusic. It\u2019s mood music,\nsomething to relax to. It\u2019s\nsoft and simple.\nYou wouldn\u2019t hear\nTim Hecker playing at\nan airport or the dentist.\nHecker eschews the\nidioms of ambient music\nwhich easily cast it, by\nthe disinterested listener,\nas muzak. Throughout\nhis career, spanning\nvarious albums and styles,\nHecker\u2019s brand of ambient\nmusic is loud and pur-poseful, strictly requiring\nyour attention. His music\nis amorphous, almost as\nif it were the mutation of\nsound as music. Perhaps\nit is even lazy to characterise his brand of music\nas \u201cambient\u201d. Hecker\u2019s\noutput, as he states, is an\nextension of his \u201cobsession with ether and things\nthat aren\u2019t fully formed\u201d,\nand is \u201cfog-based\u201d,\nalmost embodying a life\nof its own. His albums\nare entirely encapsulated,\nalmost as if it is one song,\nas he conjures abstract\nsoundscapes with what\nseems like an endless\npalette of sonic textures.\nWith the seminal\nRavedeath, 1972, we saw\nHecker incorporate more\nlive music into his compo-sitions.Among the distorted drones and aggressive\nsynthesisers, we occasionally caught glimpses\nof a piano - though disfigured and mutated. Each\nrelease thereafter would\nseek to feature more\ninstrumentation and live\nrecordings, with Virgins\n\u201cA dramatic\ndeparture\nfrom the\nsound that\ndominated\nthe majority\nof his previous\noutput\u201d\nbeing centred around\nhaunting piano phrases\nand Love Streams manipulating choral samples.\nKonoyo takes this one\nstep further, stepping into\nelectro-acoustic territory,\nwith its music heavily\ninfluenced by Gagaku, the\nimperial court music of\nJapan that had its heyday\nin the Heian Period, in the\n9th Century.\nKonoyo\u2019s stylistic\norigins are traceable to the\nlate J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson,\nas Hecker revealed in an\ninterview with The Japan\nTimes. During his recording sessions with J\u00f3hannsson, who provided choral\narrangements for Love\nStreams, the composer introduced him to the music\nof Gagaku. With this\nalbum Hecker sought to\nsubvert the \u201csuper-dense,\nkind of effect-laden\u201d\nsound he had put forth in\nalbums prior, and explore\nnotions of negative space,\nas inspired by the ancient\nJapanese art form. \u201cThere\nwas so much restraint in\nthe music of Gagaku, and\njust this kind of power.\u201d\nKonoyo sees Hecker\nworking with the improvisational compositions\nof a group of Gagaku\nmusicians. Recorded in a\ntemple in Tokyo, his latest\nalbum is a dramatic departure from the sound that\ndominated the majority\nof his previous output. On\nKonoyo we are equally\nprivy to passages of\nlive instrumentation and\nsynthesised distortions.\nThe Canadian musician\u2019s\nnew-found compositional\nlanguage is profound\nand abstract, as he pieces\ntogether a collage of\nsharp, glassy synthesisers\nwith ominous ceremonial\ninstrumentation, narrating\na disorienting, dissonant\nrendition of the apoca-lypse. The soundscapes\nswirl patiently while\ngliding synthesisers\nwail. For Hecker, the\nworld does not end in a\nblinding blaze of heat. It\nis however, cold, and we\nsuffer slowly, and accept-ingly.\nAn impressionist mas-terpiece, Konoyo stands\ntall amongst the rest of\nthe year\u2019s music. Hecker\npulls more from the post-rock cookbook than ever\nbefore and presents one of\nhis most thought provoking and complete works\nto date. Konoyo is futuristic while nostalgic, it is\nhopeful yet despondent,\nforeboding yet majestic.\nHere, he perfects what he\nultimately failed to do in\nLove Streams. The music\non Konoyo wails painful-ly, but I\u2019m not quite sure\nwhat Hecker is trying to\ntell us. Perhaps that we are\nslowly crumbling away,\nday after day.

Everyone\nhere is united in their\ndetermination to win the\nbattle against cancer.\u201d\nVice President Biden\nalso detailed how the\nBiden Cancer Initiative,\nestablished in 2017, is\nbuilding on the work of the\nObama Administration\u2019s\nCancer Moonshot that\nraised billions of dollars to\nrapidly accelerate cancer\nresearch. The Bidens\u2019 son\nBeau, a decorated Iraq\nwar veteran and attorney\ngeneral of Delaware,\ndied in May 2015, aged\n46, after being diagnosed\nwith a brain tumour.

The Centre, which\nbrings together interdisciplinary experts, has two\nkey themes: reducing\nthe burden of cancer and\nincreasing the precision of\ncancer treatments.\nAfter his talk, Vice President Biden stopped to take a selfie with Imperial students // Owen Billcliffe\nand had helped foster new\ncollaborations with countries all over the world.\nThe former Vice President urged scientists to\ncollaborate in ways that\nhaven\u2019t existed before,\ncalling for data to be made\nmore widely accessible\nand for the creation of a\ncancer research and care\nsystem that the public\ndeserves. He then went on\nto compliment Imperial\u2019s\n\u201cimpressive\u201d work in\nthe fight against cancer,\nsaying: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen\nfolks as bright and who\nwork as hard as all of you.\nYou are the most talented\ncommunity in the world\u201d.\nVice President Biden\nwarnedthat,by2025,there\nwill be almost 20 million\nnew cancer cases and 11.4\nmillion deaths around\nthe world every year. He\nadded: \u201cWe need to use\nall the expertise we have\nworking together to take\ndown this disease\u201d.

    "content": "A coming of age play about the queer experience // Pleasance Theatre\nBottom: A queer bildungsroman\nB\nottom. A term\nused to describe\na person in a\ngay relationship\nwho prefers to be the\none penetrated. However,\nthis simple expression of\nwhich sexual position one\nprefers has many other\ndeep rooted connotations\nand assumptions within\nqueer culture. And it\nis these themes which\nWilly Hudson brilliantly\naddresses in his one man\nshow Bottom.\nPerformed in a small\nroom at Pleasance\nTheatre, and also at Edinburgh Fringe, the intimate\nsetting allowed Hudson to\nconnect with the audience\nmore easily and involve\nthem as part of his show.\nHe begins the show\nimmediately breaking the\nfourth wall, by popping\nhis head out of the curtain\nand stopping the music\nas he says he\u2019s not ready\nyet. He shuffles onto the\nstage through a side door\nwearing nothing but a\nneon pink towel wrapped\naround his waist and\ndragging in a big pink bag\nwith his props. Joining his\nsimple set of the lower half\nof a mannequin wearing\nboxers on one side, and a\nmicrophone stand on the\nother side, the focus is\non the partially nude man\nstanding in front of you.\nHe proceeds to ask an\naudience member to pass\nhim his underwear from\nunder their seat, and gets\ntwo other people to hold\nhis towel tightly as he\nstarts getting dressed. We\nwait as we watch him\nget fully clothed, making\nlittle jokes about the\npattern on his socks, until\nhe proudly dons a t-shirt\nwith a head-to-toe picture\nof Beyonc\u00e9 printed on\nit. Within these first few\nminutes, the general\ntheme and nature of the\nplay has been defined as a\ncomedic display of queer\nculture.\nhe made the action, the\naudience was transported\ninto the scene as panic\nrises over the character\nabout why he is unable\nto get stimulated. The\nlights change and Hudson\nmoves from centre stage\nto stage left where he\nbegins to speak into the\nmicrophone about erectile\ndysfunction disorder. This\nchange in tone where he\nspeaks about a topic from\nhis life or queer culture\nis a theme which carries\non through the play and\nallows Hudson to have\nmore flexibility about the\nrange of topics he can\ntouch upon.\nThe play continues to\ndescribe Hudson\u2019s story\nof meeting up with a guy\non the gay dating app\nGrindr, and explaining\nhow the date had gone\nterribly wrong, especially\nas he, who has only\nbottomed in the past, now\nfails to get an erection in\nthe one situation where\nhe tries to top. Whilst this\nmay seem like a raunchy\ntale of sexual crisis and\ntrivial matters of preferred\nsexual position, Hudson\nwas able to hit many key\nnotes about the LGBT+\nexperience and queer\nculture.\nThroughout the play he\ntouches upon topics such\nas how straight women\nsometimes use gay men\nas toys for their own entertainment (referred to as\nfag hags), the concept that\ntops or bottoms can be\npredicted based upon their\nexternal appearance and\nattitude, and the internal-ised homophobia within\nthe queer community\nwhen it comes to giving\nmore respect to \u2018straight\nacting\u2019 butch gay men. I\nfeel that in some respects\nviewers who are not part\nof or closely related to\nthe LGBT+ community\nmay not understand the\nfull depth of the topics\nbeing discussed. Particularly focussing on the core\ntheme of the play which\nis bottoming and sexual\npositions, Hudson is\nsomehow able to address\nthe issue with an air of\nhumour yet seriousness\nat the same time. He\nhumour, integrated with\nconsistent and high quality\naudience participation,\nmade the experience\nmuch better than anything\nI would have expected.\nMy only qualm was\nthat at points the flow of\nthe otherwise amazing\nplay was interrupted and\nmay have caused some\nconfusion. I was unsure\nwhether Hudson purposely broke character as part\nof the play or if it was by\naccident.At certain points,\nthe lights changed and lit\nup a different part of the\nstage, and Hudson made\nan audible realisation that\nhe was supposed to move\non, but this didn\u2019t register\nas smoothly as it could\nhave done. However, I\ndo commend the use of\nbreaking the fourth wall.\nDuring one scene the\ncharacter is attempting to\ndemonstrate his desire for\nbeing a top on the mannequin on the stage but is\nunable to do so. Hudson\nbreaks character and asks\nthe tech director for what\nhe was supposed to do\nand she replies from the\nback of the room asking\nwhether he would like\nto try again, to which he\neventually asks to move\non. This seemed very real\nin the moment and added\na new layer to the play.\nOverall, this was one\nof the best amateur plays\nI have seen, and was very\nwell suited to the small\nsize of the theatre. It was\nhonestly a pleasure to\nwatch!\nWritten and performed by Willy Hudson, his one-man show Bottom shares funny, awkward and entertaining\nexperiences.\nISSUE 1701\nFELIX\n20\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nGurdip Uppal\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "ARTS\nFRIDAY, 19TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\n22\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDRAG at the Hayward Gallery\nOver the past few years,\nthe concept of cross-dress-ing and the art of drag\nhas become a popular\ntopic and, indeed, almost\nmainstream. With the\nincreasing popularity of\nthe TV competition show\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\nthe audience exposed to\nthe once underground\nculture of drag has rapidly\nincreased. However, the\nmultifaceted world of\ngender-bending is perhaps\nnot effectively portrayed\nthrough a TV show which\nfocuses primarily on drag\nqueens and the drama\nwhich ensues between\nthem. This was the exact\nissue which I felt the\nDRAG exhibition at\nHayward Gallery handled\nvery well.\nNot knowing\nmuch about what the\ngallery was displaying,\nI was taken aback by the\nsimplistic, minimalist\nlayout of the exhibition\nroom which wasn\u2019t something you would usually\nassociate with drag. With\nbare white walls sparsely\ndecorated with simple\nblack line art, the room\ndesign offset the eccentric\npieces being displayed,\navoiding complete\nsensory overload. The\npieces were not set out in\nany kind of chronological\norder or themes, which\nI felt was fitting given\nthe free and unbounded\nnature of drag. I felt that\nthe choice of art being\ndisplayed was enjoyable\nnot only in the variety of\nmediums being used, but\nalso the range of themes\nwhich were tackled.\nThis was truly an\nexhibition about drag and\nnot just drag queens. The\nconcept of drag is to have\nfun and make a mockery\nof the unstable societal\nstructure of gender and\ngender roles. This is not\nlimited to gender-bending\nmen as is often portrayed\nin mainstream media.\nThis exhibition included\na plethora of different\ntypes of drag, displaying\nboth drag kings and drag\nqueens, androgynous\npieces of work, over-the-top performance drag as\nwell as more politically\ndriven types of drag.\nWhilst the majority of the\nmedia used in the exhibition was photography and\nvideos, the odd painting\nand even a makeup wipe\n(with a face of drag\nmakeup painted on) was\nalso displayed. This\ndiverse range of themes\nand art styles made the\nexperience non-repetitive,\nand much more enjoyable.\nThe beautiful\nphotographs ranged from\nstunning self-portraits to\nstrange, conceptual pieces\nwhich had been heavily\nedited. These often\nintimate pictures added a\nnew layer of closeness to\nthe topic of drag within\nthe exhibition, where\nit was not being used\nmerely as performance,\nbut explored artistic\ndepth and sometimes\nthe political motivation\nbehind the pieces. Along\none wall of the exhibition\nwas a series of TV screens\n(some older box-style\nTVs) which integrated\nthe crucial feature of\nperformance drag into the\nshowroom. One played\na part of Rose English\u2019s\ncomedy performance \u2018My\nMathematics\u2019, where she\ndonned excessively long\nfalse eyelashes and went\non to offer members of\nthe audience a gentle\nbutterfly kiss or \u201cviolent\nlashings from her lashes\u201d.\nOther videos included\nfunny drag makeup tu-torials, weird black and\nwhite silent films, and a\ncollection of performance\nart by the legendary Leigh\nBowery. However, my\nfavourite by far was the\nspoken word performance\n\u2018Tell me everything you\nsaw, and what you think\nit means\u2019 by Victoria Sin\nwho is a hyper queen\n(a cis-gendered female\ndoing drag in the style of\ntypical male drag queens).\nIn this piece, Sin poses\nlying down, propped up\non one arm, remaining\nincredibly still aside from\nthe gentle blinking of her\neyes. This is accompanied\nby a spoken word piece\nencouraging the viewer to\nlook carefully at her body,\nthe softness in her posture,\nand the exaggerated\nfeatures of her makeup.\nShe warns the viewer that\nyou will soon no longer\nbe able to see her, and to\ntake a final look. Yet once\nthe screen goes black, you\nremain entranced by the\nsoft voice of the narrator\ndescribing how she exits\nthe frame and walks out\ninto reality.\nWhilst I did enjoy the\nexhibition, I found that\nI left seeing some very\npretty pictures and being\nentertained but not much\nmore than that. According\nto the exhibition descrip-tion, the pieces touched\nupon many topics such\nas the AIDS crisis, gay\nrights and many other\npolitical movements from\nthe 1960s to the modern\nday. Unfortunately, I felt\nthat this was not clearly\nexplored when viewing\nthe pieces of art, leaving\nthe viewer bewildered\nabout the meaning behind\nthe pieces. This was a\nparticular problem with\nthe abstract pieces, which\nwould have benefited from\nsome commentary about\nwhat the artist was ultimately trying to explore.\nAs no such commentary\nwas provided (other than\na few guided tours), I left\nfeeling slightly under-whelmed, not having fully\nunderstood the meaning\nbehind all the pieces. All\nin all, I felt that while\nDRAG was successful in\nshowcasing many features\nof the drag world, the lack\nof explanation made it\ndifficult to enjoy the exhibition to its full potential.\nA wide-ranging exhibition that showcases the variety to be found in the art form.\nQueen // Victoria Sin\n\u201cTruly an\nexhibition\nabout drag\nand not just\ndrag queens\u201d\nARTS\nGurdip Uppal\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Imperial Dominates Duathlon with VeloPark Victories\nSPORTS\nMark Pollock\nTriathlon Treasurer\nT\nhe morning\nstarted with an\nalarm sounding\nat 6:30AM \u2013 not\na particularly cruel time\nfor a triathlete, but for\nmany students it was a\nrelaxed Sunday morning\nlie-in. Undeterred by the\nrain and forecast thunder-storms, they made their\nway over to the Velopark\nin Stratford. Travelling on\nthe tube with a non-folded\nbicycle was experienced\nfor the first time by\nmany, with a few hardy\nmembers seeking to save\nthemselves the hassle and\ncycle the twelve miles to\nStratford instead. Imperial\nTriathlon had twelve\nteams of three entered into\nthe competition, which\nmeant that just shy of half\nthe field was filled with\nImperial\u2019s finest.\nMany of the Imperial\nathletes had never done\na duathlon before, with\nmost coming from a\nbackground in only one of\nthe triathlon holy trinity\nof swimming, cycling or\nrunning. Some had never\nraced running or on a bike\nbefore (special mention\ngoes to Liv Papaioannou\nwho was unable to change\ngear for the first two laps\nof her bike leg), and many\nhad never done a triathlon\ntransition before \u2013 yet\neveryone learnt on the job\nand finished the race!\nDespite the course\nbeing suitably saturated\n\u201cWith\nthunderous\nsupport from\nthe crowd,\nImperial were\ndominating\u201d\n\u201cIt was no\nsurprise that\nthey took\nhome more\nthan their\nfair share of\nmedals, with 6\nImperial teams\nappearing in\nthe top 10\u201d\nwith water, the rain fortunately held off for the start\nof the race. The duathlon\nconsisted of a two mile\nrun, six mile cycle, one\nmile run for each person,\nmeaning the team of\nthree would complete the\none-mile circuit a total of\n27 times.\nThe first leg began\nat 9:30, starting with\nthe run. Pre-race hype\ncombined with thinking\nthe course was shorter\nthan it was (figure-of-eight courses can be\ndeceiving) meant pacing\namong the front-runners\nwas somewhat optimis-tic. After two laps of\nthe course the first few\nentered the transition area,\nwhich can either make or\nbreak a multi-event race.\nThis time everyone\npassed through transition\nwithout trouble and\nmounted their bikes\nwithout hiccup or hesita-tion. Six bike laps were\nnext on the agenda for\nthe duathletes, with the\nwet conditions and tight\ncorners making this a\nrelatively technical ride.\nYet with thunderous\nsupport from the crowd,\nImperial were dominat-ing.\nIC were holding first\nplace in the men\u2019s, mixed\nand women\u2019s teams. Club\ncaptain Edmund Jones\nwas first into the final\ntransition of the first leg\nathletes, where he (and\neveryone behind him)\nnow faced another run.\nMercifully this run was\nhalf the distance of the\nfirst.\nThe first-timers to\nduathlon quickly noticed\nthat running after cycling\nis much more difficult\nthan running before\ncycling, and the phenomena known as \u2018heavy-leg\nsyndrome\u2019 was experienced by all.\nWith the expected\ndownpour still to materi-alise, the relay transitions\nbegan to occur, at which\npoint everything became\na lot more confusing.\nAs competitors were at\ndifferent stages of the\nrace it was not really clear\nwho was beating who, or\nwhich lap they were on,\nwhich made for some\nunexpected surprises later\non. Imperial\u2019s \u2018all the\ngear and no idea\u2019 team\nfeaturing Edmund Jones,\nEd Clark, and Romain\n(the Rocket) Barnoud\nthought they had the win\nin the bag when they were\nover one lap ahead of 2nd\nplace. Only problem was\nthe 2nd place team (which\nwere sadly not Imperial)\nwere actually on the\nsame lap and it became\napparent the men\u2019s race\nwas going to come down\nto a photo-finish.\nRomain was living up\nto his nickname on the\nbike with his fastest lap\naveraging 38km/h, but\nit was only just enough\n\u2013 Imperial came out on\ntop with a two-second\nwin in a staggering time\nof 1:45:50. The women\u2019s\nrace was still led by\nwho both produced star\nperformances despite\nlearning it all on the go.\nThe fastest mixed team\nwenttoGregJones,Fergus\nJohnson (who had the\nfastest run split of the day),\nand Liv Papaioannou.\nAfter the first few teams\nhad finished, everyone\ngathered together to cheer\nthe remaining duathletes,\nwith a particularly ebullient applause for the last\nrunner to finish.\nWith everyone home\nand dry, the medal\nceremony followed. With\nsuch breadth and depth in\nthe Imperial cohort it was\nno surprise that they took\nhome more than their fair\nshare of medals, with six\nImperial teams appearing\nin the top ten.\nThe team then began\nthe long journey home \u2013\ntired, proud, and in want\nof a shower. Overall, a\nhighly successful outing\nfor Imperial Triathlon\nboth in terms of experience gained and medals\nwon.\nThe next duathlon is\nHillingdon Duathlon on\nSunday 11th November,\nemail the club account\ntraithlon@imperial.ac.uk\nif you want to join in the\nfun!\nThe squad that set out to the duathlon // Triathlon\nFRIDAY, 19TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n32\nThe winning womens team! // Triathlon\nMarion Artigaud, Marena\nGray and Alex Mundell\nwho held their lead and\nended up winning the\nrace.\nThe club wishes to\ngive a special mention to\nthe fastest freshers Angus\nPhilips and Emma Walsh,\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 19TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\nBirth of words\nSCIENCE\nPaula Rowi\u0144ska\nScience Writer\nA\nteam of linguists\nand geographers\nfrom the Centre\nfor Corpus\nResearch at the University\nof Birmingham traced\nthe geographical roots\nof emerging words in\nAmericanEnglish.Among\n8.9 billion words used in\n980 million Tweets posted\nin the US they identified\n54 new words, which\nwere rare in October 2013\nbut common in November\n2014.\nEvery time you tweet,\nthe app records your\nprecise location as well\nas the posting time. This\nallowed Professor Jack\nGrieve and his group to\nidentify the birth regions\nof emerging words: the\nWest Coast, the Northeast,\nthe Mid Atlantic, the Deep\nSouth, or the Gulf Coast.\nResearchers observed\nsome interesting patterns\nof linguistic innovation.\nNew words tend to appear\nin densely populated areas\nof a particular region and\nspread to similar areas\nin other regions of the\ncountry. For example, Los\nAngeles and San Francisco are the most creative\nparts of the West Coast,\nfrom which words diffuse\nto Seattle and Portland\n(the Northwest) as well as\nSan Diego, Las Vegas and\nPhoenix (the Southwest).\nAlthough it might seem\nthat we can predict the\npatterns of word creation\nand migration by the population density, the Deep\nSouth is an exception. In\nthis region the linguistic\ninnovation is mostly\ndriven by the culture. For\nexample, Atlanta, a city\nmuch smaller than Los\nAngeles or New York,\nshows a lot of creative\npower. Scientists attributed this effect to a large\nAfrican American population in the capital of\nGeorgia, as they observed\nthe quick spread of words\nbetween areas with large\npopulations representing\nthis culture, irrespective\nof their geographical\nproximity.\nProfessor Grieve and\nhis team acknowledge\nthe main limitation of\nthis study: Twitter represents only one variety of\nAmerican English. New\nwords created for example\nin science cannot be reflected by this analysis.\n\u201cThis is the first time\nthat such a large sample\nof emerging words or any\ntype of linguistic innovation has been mapped\nin one language\u201d, commented professor Grieve.\nModern data science and\ncomputational tools are\nchanging the field of lin-guistics, so in the future\nwe can expect more large\nstudies answering many\nburning questions about\nDark cores (not a new Ben and Jerry\u2019s\u2122 flavour)\nI\nn day to day life we all\nencounter people who\nconsistently exhibit\nmorally questionable\nbehaviour. Psychologists\ndescribe these individuals\nas possessing one or more\n\u201cdark\u201d traits. Previous\nstudies have shown that\nthese traits relate to one\nanother - but do they\nshare a common denominator \u2026 a \u201cdark core\u201d?\nRecent research from the\nUniversity of Copenhagen\nhas found evidence that\nthis may actually be the\ncase!\nThe presence of nine\ndark traits was identified\nin over 2,500 participants\nusing questionnaires.\nAnalyses of these data\nidentified positive correlations between all\nnine traits, signifying a\ncommon origin, or \u201cdark\ncore\u201d. Importantly, the\nobservation of any individual trait can predict\nwith equal certainty the\npresence of other dark\ntraits, an incident termed\nthe \u201cindifference of the\nindicator\u201d.\nThe dark core is defined\nas the general tendency\ntoward maximising one\u2019s\nown goals at the expense\nof others, accompanied by\nbeliefs that justify these\nbehaviours. The dark core\ncan manifest in many\ndifferent forms, including the nine dark traits.\nHowever, the Copenhagen\nstudy demonstrates that\nthese are all expressions\nof the same dispositional\nTwitter users see a great number of new words//Flickr\ntendency.\nThe nine traits are conceptually distinct, but in\npractice they have many\nmore aspects in common\nthan aspects setting\nthem apart. Some dark\ntraits may seem more\nacceptable than others,\nfor example narcissism\nversus psychopathy,\nbut people possessing\neither trait have the\nsame disposition to\nSCIENCE\nPhotini Knoyle\nScience Writer\nBaeless, faved and yaas \u2013 if you use Twitter, you will have already seen some of these newly created words. But\nwhere do they come from?\n\u201c\u2026I know they seem a little narcissistic, but they\u2019re actually a really good person...\u201d \u2013 maybe not, states recent\nresearch from the University of Copenhagen, which identifies a common denominator across many malevolent\nhuman behaviours: a dark core.\nRotten to the core: nine malevolent human traits found\nto be correlated in a recent study by the University of\nCopenhagen //Photini Knoyle\nthe language.\ncarry other malevolent\ntraits. The researchers\nnote that this finding has\nimportant implications for\ncriminology, in particular\nascertaining whether an\nindividual will reoffend,\nor even partake in more\nharmful behaviour. This\nresearch can also inform\nfuture studies into the\ncognitive patterns and\nbrain physiology of individuals possessing dark\ntraits and help identify the\nrisk factors and triggers\nfor their development.\nThe nine dark traits\nresearched in this study:\n1. Egoism: motivation\nto only serve one\u2019s own\ninterests;\n2. Machiavellianism:\ncallous manipulation of\nothers;\n3. Moral disengage-ment: belief that moral\nstandards do not apply to\noneself;\n4. Narcissism: self-ab-sorption, a sense of supe-riority;\n5. Psychological enti-tlement: consistent belief\nthat one is entitled to more\nthan others;\n6. Psychopathy: superficial charm, lack of\nempathy;\n7. Sadism: deriving\npleasure from inflicting\npain;\n8 . S e l f - i n t e r e s t :\nambition to better one\u2019s\nstatus, without regards for\nothers;\n9. Spitefulness: mali-ciousness even at personal\nexpense.\nWant to know the extent\nof your own dark core?\nHead on over to http://qst.\ndarkfactor.org/\n\n"

You don\u2019t have to prove guilt.\nAlso, did I mention he sucks ass?\nTheodor Videnberg\nComment writer\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic editor\nT\nhree weeks\nago Henry\nEshbaugh wrote\nan article titled\n\u201cStuck in my Kavacraw\u201d about US supreme\ncourt nominee Brett\nKavanaugh. In the rather\npolemical piece he\ncalled Kavanaugh \u201cnonhuman\u201d, \u201ca nympho\nwho raped people\u201d\nand a \u201cperv\u201d. Henry\nclaimed that there were\nmultiple credible and\ncorroborating witnesses\nagainst the US Supreme\nCourt nominee.\nI want to get the\nfacts straight: On\nJuly 9, US president\nTrump nominated\nJudge Kavanaugh to\nthe US Supreme Court.\nKavanaugh had served\nthe previous 12 years on\nthe 2nd most important\nUS court, was a lecturer at\nHarvard Law School and\nhad otherwise flawless\nacademic credentials and\na brilliant CV.\nHe had passed 6 FBI\nbackground checks\npreviously and answered\na total of 1297 questions\nin the Supreme Court\nhearings. On July 30,\nDr. Christine Blasey\nFord, a professor of\nwere high schoolers in\nMaryland. She asked to\nhave the issue treated\nconfidentially and remain\nanonymous. The case\nremained secret until 13\nSeptember when her letter\ngot leaked to the media (by\nFeinstein?) and several\noutlets like Washington\nPost, New York Times\nand The New Yorker\nran stories on her. Since\nthen two other witnesses,\nDeborah Ramirez and\nJulie Swetnick came\nforward with allegations\nagainst Kavanaugh who\nvehemently denied all\naccusations. In the wake\nof the #metoo-movement,\na media spectacle started.\nBoth Dr. Ford and\nJudge Kavanaugh made\nstatements in front of\nthe US Senate Judicial\nCommittee, repeating\ntheir initial statements.\nAmidst the controversy,\nthe senators decided to\nopen a FBI investigation\ninto the matter and find\nT\nhree weeks ago,\nI wrote an article\ntitled \u201cStuck in\nmy Kava-craw\u201d\nabout how badly this\nCHUD sucks at his job.\nAnd yeah, I hit the notes\non his multiple accusers\npointing to sexual misconduct in multiple cases\nover many years. This\nisn\u2019t a criminal case. He\u2019s\nnot going to go to jail. This\nisn\u2019t a matter for the fucking justice system. He\u2019s\njust not going to get the\njob. Or, he wouldn\u2019t, if the\ngovernment wasn\u2019t full of\nspineless partisan hacks\nacting in bad faith and\ntrying to cover their own\nass with a SCOTUS ap-pointment. There\u2019s clearly\na much lower standard for\ndisqualification here than\nmy comment compatriot\nwould lead you to believe,\nand the whole complaint\nis essentially that the\ngovernment is currently\nmade up of unprincipled\ndipshits.\nFurthermore, the FBI\nprobe he points to was\nlimited in scope to the\npoint where corroborating\nwitnesses were barred\nfrom testifying by the\nexecutive that nominated\nhim. Folks from the FBI\nin senate testimony essentially noted that this probe\nwas a farce, politically\nmotivated to the core, and\nessentially useless insofar\nas \u201cproving guilt\u201d goes.\nThis was obvious to any\nspectator not marinading\nin Breitbart.\nBut hey, if you wanna\nregurgitate alt-right\ntalking points you licked\noff the grass: we don\u2019t\neven need to talk about\nthese allegations. There\nare fairly trivial points\nagainst him.\nHow about the fact\nthat Kavanaugh was the\nonly guy on the Federalist\nSociety shortlist who\nbelieves that 1. there\nshouldn\u2019t be federal\nprobes into misconduct by\nsitting presidents (conven-ient for Agent Orange),\nand 2. there shouldn\u2019t be\ndouble-jeopardy state-wise (in other words, the\nSDNY probe into Trump\u2019s\nshitty finances is barred\ntoo). If he gets his nomination he\u2019ll have a free\njudge in the pocket. Real\nnice, guys. I wonder why\nTrump, a president who\u2019s\nfacing a state and federal\nprobe into his shady\ndealings, and a guy with\nauthoritarian leanings,\nwould want to stack the\ncourt in his favor?\nDoesn\u2019t it seem strange\nthat this is his unique\nselling point over anyone\nelse on the shortlist, and\nit would\u2019ve been cake\nto retract his nomination\nand vomit up some other\nnitwit, but the Republicans decided to fight a\npitched battle to get him\nappointed?\nBut we don\u2019t even need\nto go there. How about the\nfact that Kavanaugh was\na part of the Bush white\nhouse - a dude who wrote\nlegal briefs defending\ntorture? Don\u2019t tell me\na guy like that deserves\na place on the Supreme\npsychology at Palo Alto\nUniversity and registered\nDemocrat, wrote a letter\nto Democratic senator\nDianne Feinstein,\nclaiming that Kavanaugh\nhad tried to rape her in\nthe 1980s when both\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\nKavanaugh\u2019s accuse, Christine Blasey Ford swears at her testimony // Flickr\n\u201cThe FBI\nproduced\na several\nhundred page\nlong report\nthat found:\nnothing!\u201d\nUS Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh (centre) is sworn in by Chief Justice\nJohn Roberts (right). He is surrounded by his wife and daughters // CNN\nCOMMENT\nFRIDAY, 19TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\n9\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ncorroborating witnesses.\nAfter a thorough and\ndeep investigation, the\nFBI produced a several\nhundred page long report\nthat found: nothing! No\ncorroborating witnesses,\nno evidence, if all\nKavanaugh\u2019s credibility\nwas strengthened and\nthe credibility of the\nthree accusers severely\ndamaged.\nDr. Ford had named 3\nwitnesses of the alleged\nparty where supposedly\nKavanaugh tried to rape\nher: Mark Judge (he\ndenied that the party\nhad ever happened), PJ\nSmyth (also denied this\nparty ever happened) and\nher best friend from high\nschool, Leyland Keyser.\nKeyser responded under\noath she did not even\nknow Kavanaugh and had\nnever been at a party with\nhim. Dr. Ford could not\nremember any details of\nthe party: Where was the\nhouse? Which year did it\nhappen? Who brought her\nto the house?Who brought\nher home? Whose house\nwas it? Did she confide\nin anyone? Nothing. Only\nthing she remembered: it\nwas Kavanaugh and she\nhad one beer.\nThe second accuser,\nJulie Swetnick, said\nKavanaugh was the leader\nCourt - they\u2019re supposed\nto have something of a\nmoral compass. Funny\nhow that was sealed and\nnever a matter of discussion for the senate.\nHow about the fact that\nif you really wanted to\nrepeal Roe v. Wade, you\ncould just appoint Allison\nEid? Just play the idpol\ngame, you nitwits. Watch\nthe libs squirm - this\nis the American \u201cleft\u201d\nwe\u2019re talking about, and\nprivileged as they are,\nthey seem incapable of\ntalking about economic\ninjustice in any fucking\nform. Y\u2019ever wonder why\nHillary lost?\nWe don\u2019t even need to\ngo there. How about the\nmatter of judicial temper-ment? \u201cI\u2019ve never blacked\nout, senator. Have you?\u201d\nFucking please. I get to\nspout shit because this is\ntheFelixcommentsection,\nand being entertaining is\ntherefore something of my\njob. Does this seem like\ntemperment worthy of the\nhigest court in a nation\nof 300 million people, a\nlifetime appointment? He\nobviously doesn\u2019t have a\nsuitable temperment. Hell,\nit\u2019s kind of ironic that this\nportion of the testimony\nwas about his drinking,\nbecause it seemed to me\n(a student, and thereby\none who drinks) like he\nknocked some scotch\nback over lunch. How do\nyou make these comments\nsober?\nHell, how about the\nfact that he perjured\nhimself multiple times\nduring his testimony?\nThere are supposedly\ncriminal consequences to\nthis. What do you think\nthey wrote up Bill Clinton\nfor? He should have been\ncensured by the senate\nand summarily dismissed,\nbut unfortunately, we live\nin Hell.\nWhat about the shady\nway in which these pro-ceedigns started? Why did\nAnthony Kennedy resign?\nSomething smells; he\nhired clerks for next term\nalready, so this was clearly\na spur-of-the-moment\ndecision. It definitely\ndoesn\u2019t have anything\nto do with the fact that\nhis son was at Deutsche\nBank (recently fined a\nhistoric sum for laundering Russian money), in\ncharge of the real estate\ndivision, during the Great\nRecession. Trump was\nat the time well-known\nto be a bad businessman;\nhe was on the verge of\nsinking, and he was saved\nby - guess who? There\u2019s a\nfunny clip where Trump\u2019s\njust finished a State of the\nUnion address -- he shakes\nAnthony Kennedy\u2019s hand\nand mostly talks about\nhow great his son is. Does\nsomething smell funny to\nyou?\nOr what about the\nobscene debts developed\nfrom \u201cbuying season\ntickets to baseball games\u201d\nthat definitely weren\u2019t\ngambling debts? Does it\nseem strange to you that\nthese were paid off by a\ndark-money group (like\nthe one that paid Collins\nsix figures for her vote up).\nWhere was the pointed\nline of questioning?\nI know Latin too, you\nknow -- to close, I\u2019ll\nprovide my own; thank\nHenry Beard for the trans-lation. Te oportet futuere\ntete. Tu tibi futuendus es.\nVelim te futuas. Te rogo ut\nfutuas te ipsum.\nCheers, bud.\n\u201cThe burden\nof proof is on\nthe one who\ndeclares, not\non the one\nwho denies\u201d\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\nProtesters supporting Christine Blasey Ford // Flickr\nof a gang rape ring and\nnamed 4 witnesses: 2 of\nthem did not respond to\ninterview requests, one\nwas already deceased\nand one plainly denied\nknowledge of any such\nring or incidents.\nSimilarly, the FBI\ncould not find any\ncorroborating witnesses\nfrom an incident at Yale\nUniversity that Deborah\nRamirez had described.\nThe interviewees that the\nFBI asked, denied any\nknowledge of any incident\ninvolving Kavanaugh and\nRamirez. Requests by\nFBI officials to give more\nevidence, were ignored by\nRamirez\u2019s lawyers.\nAll accusations against\nKavanaugh came down\ncrashing like a house\nof cards. On October 6,\nJudge Kavanaugh was\nconfirmed with a senate\nvote of 50-48 to the US\nSupreme Court amidst\nhostile and violent\nprotests of #metoo-activists. Meanwhile Dr.\nFord has backed down\nher claims and does not\nwant Judge Kavanaugh\nto be impeached should\nthe Democrats win the\nUS House elections.\nShe has now walked\naway with 700 000 USD\nfrom the GoFundMewebsite. It is unlikely\nshe will be prosecuted\nfor her uncorroborated\naccusations.\nThe justice system is\nbased on the principle of\n\u201cinnocent until proven\nguilty\u201d (Latin maxim:\nei incumbit probatio qui\ndicit, non qui negat; the\nburden of proof is on the\none who declares, not\non the one who denies).\nI would like to ask\neveryone to adhere to that\nprinciple and give Brett\nKavanaugh, a man of high\ncharacter and academic\ncredentials, whose name\nand reputation were\nwrongfully demolished\non the altar of vile,\nheinous, unsubstantiated\nund uncorroborated\naccusations and whose\nwife and daughters got\ndeath and rape threats,\nwhat he deserves: respect\nand an apology.\nTheodor Videnberg\nComment writer\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic editor\nTrump and Kavanaugh shaking hands// Vox\n\n"
