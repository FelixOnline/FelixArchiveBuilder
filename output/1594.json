This\npage was especially slanderous, with\nthe admin also being particularly vile\nto students voicing their complaints\nand refusing to take posts down that\nwere mentioning their name if the\nadmin thought the offensive posts\nwere justified.\nBoth the admin and the page\nwas reported to both ICT and the\nCollege Tutors, and although College\nCommunications could not discuss\nindividual cases to us, as far as we\nare aware, nothing was done to the\nindividual despite his full name\npassed over to this board of senior\nstaff that deal with disciplinary\nprocedures and are also there to keep\nthe welfare of the student body in\ncheck.\nStudents are joining these pages\nbecause of the sense of community\nthey emulate, not just for the joke\nposts and the humour. They join\nbecause they see a page named after\ntheir university, and, as a student\nbody that is often criticised as being\nfractured and divided, enjoy these\nonline windows that capture the ethos\nof Imperial so succinctly.\nLiking it takes no effort at all, and\nsuddenly any post from that page is\ncatapulted straight to their timelines.\nDespite College offering all of\ntheir policies on IT, branding and\nimage use, in their responses to our\nquestions this week, in practise no\npage has ever been shut down or any\naction taken against students running\nthese high-profile platforms. And\nwe are not saying they should; most\npages and their posts are amicable\nand are not a cause for concern at all.\nHowever some posts tread a thin\nline, and with such a large audience\nand seemingly no consequences\nfor what is posted and when, and\nImperial seemingly powerless to\nintervene, these pages are almost a\nticking time bomb. With admins\nchanging as people graduate, and\nsome pages taking content from\nanyone through those Google\nsubmission forms, one pressed button\nor poorly worded message can reach\nthe corners of campus in a matter of\nminutes, including the student it may\nbe about.\nIf people are joining a page because\nthey are using the Imperial name to\ndraw that large audience in, Imperial\nshould also be intervening when\nstudents come to them for help over\nthe posts. It\u2019s all well and good to have\nthese policies, but when College is\naware of the pages and they are still\nposting defamatory posts and even\nattacking students, College is failing\nin keeping their students safe.\nFor now though, there seems to\nbe nothing more threatening than\nstudents attempting to organise a\ndistasteful orgy, along with some\npretty dodgy science chat-up lines.\nEnjoy them, even post to them\nif you like, but remember that\nanonymity can make people feel\neven more alone and compound\nthat feeling of being targeted. People\nmay be more brazen on one side\nof the screen, but they are equally\nmore vulnerable when on the other,\nreceiving side.\nFelix News Reporter Workshop\nMonday 26th January\nMeeting Room 3, Union Building\n12.30pm until 1.30pm\nAttendance is free and snacks are\nprovided.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 21\nFELIX 23.01.2015\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park and Jack Steadman\nChandor\u2019s trifecta\nChandor has a faultless record\nas a writer/director with his\nprevious films Margin Call\nand All is Lost. The record continues\nunblemished with his newest\nsimmering crime drama. This time\nhe is tackling 1981, statistically the\nmost violent year in New York City\n\u2013 hence the title. Trying to expand\nyour business, and wanting to make\nit to the very top is a dangerous\nambition to have, even more so when\nthe climate is this volatile. Yet this\ndoes not stop Abel Morales (Oscar\nIsaac) from pushing forward with\nhis plans. He puts in a significant\namount of deposit for a new oil\nrefinery, with big dreams to get\nahead\nAbel faces a lot of challenges to be a\nsuccessful businessman. His sinister\nrivals look as though they are up\nto no good, there is a particularly\npersistent District Attorney (David\nOyelowo) who is investigating Abel\u2019s\ncompany for illegal activities, his\noil truck drivers are constantly\ngetting attacked and the oil itself is\ngetting stolen left and right. Who\nis behind this attempted sabotage?\nIt is difficult to tell or pinpoint\none person given how many would\nprofit from seeing Abel fall from his\nposition of power. As a hard-working,\nidealistic immigrant, Abel wants to\nkeep things all legal and clean. He\nwants to have nothing to hide but\nwhen the atmosphere is this corrupt,\nhe soon learns that it becomes\nincreasingly difficult to have his\nmorality intact. His wife Lady\nMacbeth Anna (Jessica Chastain), on\nthe other hand, is more realistic in\nher vision of the world, seeing it for\nwhat it truly is. She laughs and scoffs\nat her husband\u2019s naive beliefs.\nAlways impeccably dressed and\naccessorised, Chastain\u2019s supporting\nperformance is a real treat. \u201cYou\u2019re\nnot gonna like what\u2019ll happen once\nI get involved\u201d she says, and she\nmeans every word. She also has\nno trouble facing off against the\nDistrict Attorney, insisting that\nhe should treat her family with a\nlittle more respect. Abel\u2019s struggle\nto keep everything under control as\nan upstanding citizen is captured\nimmensely well by Isaac, an actor\nwho has racked up a number of\nimpressive roles in a variety of\nrelatively smaller, independent\nfilms, largely in supporting roles.\nHere, he makes for a very engaging\nlead, and his charismatic presence\nfits in well with the smart narrative.\nChandor is not interested in\npacking the film with big, showy\nscenes that tend to make their\nappearances during the annual\nawards seasons. Even in a story\nthat could call for a big bust-up\nbetween competitors and a neverending body count, the film remains\nintimate, staying as close to the\ncentral characters as possible. What\nsecrets, if any, is Abel hiding? Is he\nreally as honourable and trustworthy\nas he claims to be? Running into\nfinancial troubles, and an imminent\nthreat that puts him, his wife, and\ntheir daughters at risk, will no doubt\npush him into the ambiguous, hazy\nzone of moral values. Keeping the\nviolence mostly at bay, despite\nthe title, delivers further shock\nto the audience when blood is\neventually and unavoidably spilled.\nThe story keeps you guessing, and\nthat is because even the characters\nthemselves cannot figure out just\nwhat they are ultimately capable of.\nA MOST VIOLENT\nYEAR\nDirector: J. C. Chandor\nScreenplay: J. C. Chandor\nCast: Oscar Isaac, Jessica\nChastain\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: J. C. Chandor, FilmNation Entertainment\nMark Wahlberg goes for\nthe most serious, scruffy\nperformance of his career\nso far, playing a gambling addict\nwho just cannot help himself go on\na majorly self-destructive path that\naffects not only him, but also many\nof people around him. Jim Bennett\n(Mark Wahlberg) loves the rush of\nplaying blackjack, betting on roulette\ncolours, and even going so far to cut\ncards with loan shark Neville Baraka\n(Michael K. Williams), the kind of\nperson who does not look kindly\non late payments. Taking part in an\nunderground gambling ring owned\nby violent Koreans only takes up the\nnight time of his life. When he is not\nbusy losing money and owing a lot\nof important people lots of money,\nJim is a literature professor who is\nstruggling to keep his class interested\nin the subject he is teaching.\nIs he purposefully setting himself\nup to hit rock bottom? It is an entirely\nconceivable theory, given the way\nhe is acting. His shockingly cavalier\nattitude towards everything certainly\nsuggests that whatever harm that\nmay come to him is of absolutely no\nconcern to him whatsoever. Threats\nfrom both the Koreans and the loan\nshark seem to have unfazed him.\nWhen he is given the deadline of\nseven days to come up with a grand\ntotal of $260,000, he has no trouble,\nnor any sense of shame in strutting\nWahlberg\u2019s gamble\nTHE GAMBLER\nDirector: Rupert Wyatt\nScreenplay: William Monahan\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, Jessica\nLange, John Goodman\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nback to his wealthy mother Roberta\n(Jessica Lange) to beg once again\nfor money. Another very unwise\nplan of his includes approaching\nyet another loan shark, as if he does\nnot have enough of those in his life.\nFrank (John Goodman) is quite an\nindividual who enjoys talking the big\ntalk, and showing to everyone who is\nboss, and Goodman has fun with this\nlarger-than-life character, despite his\nlimited screen time.\nWahlberg is in a highly dislikeable\nrole, and seeing him as a supposedly\nintelligent English professor, who is\nquite possibly a genius as is hinted at\nthroughout the film, talking about\nShakespeare to a classroom full of\ncollege students is not without its\nawkward moments. His portrayal of\nan addict is never given enough room\nto breathe, which does nothing for the\nactor to show anything unique in his\nperformance. Gambling addiction,\nlike any addiction, can be seen as\na disease, and the protagonist\u2019s\nrelentless effort to do nothing about\nit, provides interesting opportunities\nfor the writer to explore in depth just\nwhat on earth is going on inside his\nhead.\nSadly director Rupert Wyatt is\ninterested only in stringing together\none implausible subplot after\nanother. Jim\u2019s blossoming romance\nwith his genius student Amy (Brie\nLarson) marks a particular low, as is\neverything that comesfrom it, and yes\nthat includes that final clich\u00e9d scene\nof a last-minute dash. The talented\nJessica Lange deserves a meatier\nsupporting role than this, one that\npreferably includes something more\nthan slapping Wahlberg across the\nface for being an ungrateful brat. The\nfilm also dabbles in sports betting,\nand an intentional rigging of scores\nto satisfy powerful betters. The\nwell-intentioned message is clear: an\naddiction affects more than just the\naddict. The final execution however\nfalls short of delivering it.\nPhoto: Rupert Wyatt, Paramount Pictures\nThe Babadook\nThis week,Imperial Cinema are\ntaking a trip into the depths of\nyour nightmares,and into one of\nthe greatest horror films of the\npast few years.\nWritten and directed by\nJennifer Kent,this is the story\nof the widowed Amelia (Essie\nDavis) and her son Sam (Noah\nWiseman),who find a popup storybook about\u201cMister\nBabadook\u201d.As Sam\u2019s behaviour\ngrows more erratic,and\nterrifying events with no earthly\nexplanation begin to consume\ntheir household,Amelia is left\nto fight for her sanity and for her\nson.But you can\u2019t get rid of the\nBabadook.\nTuesday 27th and Thursday\n29th January,19:00\nTickets are \u00a33 for members and\n\u00a34 for non-members.Doors open\n15 minutes before the advertised\nstart time.\n\n"

    "content": "12 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n23.01.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCharlie Hebdo just isn\u2019t funny enough\nLet\u2019s face it, 2014 was not a\ngreat year. Tragedies ranging\nfrom epidemics to political\ntension to aviation mysteries to\nreligious extremism defined those\ntwelve depressing months. Even the\nsupposed sporting highlights were\novershadowed by allegations of greed\nand corruption. At best, it was a 3/10.\nEveryone is hoping that 2015 will\nbe different. Is a 6/10 too much to\nask? Only seven days in, however, the\ndream suffered a huge body blow. The\nCharlie Hebdo attack has been widely\ncovered and I\u2019m sure you all know\nwhat happened.\nThe mass shooting was as moronic\nas it was despicable. To kill over a\ncartoon is the kind of improbable\noverreaction that you only see\nin a cartoon. The attackers\u2019 plan\nwas deeply flawed and the assault\non Charlie Hebdo\u2019s head office,\nconsidering their motivations, was\nincredibly counterproductive.\nI doubt that many Muslims have\never read Charlie Hebdo. It was not a\nhugely popular publication, with a\ncirculation of around 45,000 a week.\nThe left-wing magazine describes\nitself as strongly anti-religion.\nThis makes the paper very easy for\nMuslims to avoid. But after the attack\nthe paper became the most talked-about publication in the world, and\nthe subsequent edition increased\nits print run to 7 million in order to\nmeet demand, and it seems that an act\nof savage terrorism has temporarily\nsaved the print industry.\nUnsurprisingly, the Prophet\nMohammad made an appearance on\nthe front of the magazine. It is now\na lot harder for those who will be\noffended by the publication to avoid\nthese cartoons, and support for the\nsatirical newspaper has increased\nexponentially. This attempt to\nsuppress freedom of expression has\nseriously backfired.\nLike most people, I had never\nheard of Charlie Hebdo before news\nbroke of the senseless killings, and\nknew nothing of their controversial\ndepictions of the Prophet\nMohammad. After the unforgivable\nshootings, I had a look at the\ncartoons, and if I\u2019m honest, I had a\nproblem with them: they just weren\u2019t\nthat funny.\nCharlie Hebdo\u2019s portrayals of\nMohammad are clich\u00e9 and stale, and\ndon\u2019t even attempt to make any kind\nof point about Islam. Any satirical\nmessage is undercut by juvenile\nhumour, and this makes reasonable\nfollowers of Islam less likely to\nunderstand the majority of the West\u2019s\npeaceful position.\nMost Brits want to coexist with the\nIslamic world but these images will\nnot get us any closer to this ambition.\nI whole-heartedly support Charlie\nHebdo\u2019s right to publish the cartoons;\nbut that does not mean that I like\nthem.\nSociety functions best when citizens\ncan have reasonable debates about\ntheir views, and challenge each\nother\u2019s opinion. One such vehicle\nfor this is satire, but it seems to me\nthat the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in\nquestion barely qualify as satire. It\u2019s\njust a dumb picture of Mohammad\n\u2013 a lazy caricature devoid of wit and\ncommentary. The correct response\nto these cartoons is to voice your\nopinion about them, or write a\ncolumn like I have here, not to shoot\nthe people responsible. People who\nwill kill others over a joke, no matter\nhow offensive, are sick in the head.\nIn order to prove the terrorists\nhave lost, we must go back to business\nas usual. When I heard that Charlie\nHebdo was going to print the next\nedition only days after the brutal\ndeaths of their colleagues I applauded\ntheir courage and perseverance. The\n\u2018Je suis Charlie\u2019 demonstrations that\ntook place reassured me that people\nare ready to protest against threats to\na free society. I just think it\u2019s a shame\nthat the cartoons provoked a lot of\nhatred without making many people\nlaugh, or even think.\nCharlie Hebdo increased their print run dramatically in light of the attacks, but it's a shame\nthat it had to be over something so unfunny. Photo: The Independent\nJOSHUA RENKEN\nCOMMENT WRITER\nPublish offensive material if you like, just make it good!\n\"Charlie\nHebdo\u2019s\nportrayals\nof\nMohammad\nare clich\u00e9\nand stale\"\n\"...the\ncartoons\nprovoked a\nlot of hatred\nwithout\nmaking\nmany\npeople\nlaugh\"\n\n"

It includes a major\nrevamp of the way it works, adding\nbenefits both in its user interface\nand in its engine for the user. Today\nFelix Technology takes a look at what\nwe should expect from the latest\naddition to Felix\u2019s digital \u201cempire\u201d.\nFor those who had either of last\nyear\u2019s versions of the iPhone app,\nthe difference is obvious from the\nstart. The user interface has been\ncompletely changed. Gone is the\nsplash screen that prompted the user\nto \u201cClick on the cat to launch Felix\u201d.\nNo, the user is sent straight into the\naction of the news page. Users are\ngreeted with the top three articles\nfor the section, and an easy to read\ntable of the remaining articles for the\nsection.\nOne of the first things you notice is\nthe speed. Previous versions of Felix\nhave been designed in a way that they\nalways download the latest content\ninstantly, images and all. This takes\ntime. Precious time. Now it\u2019s all\ndifferent. The Felix app downloads\nthe article once and saves it. Beyond\nthat, you can manually refresh to\nget new content. This has many\nbenefits, but speed is a major factor.\nNow that all your articles are already\ndownloaded, the app doesn\u2019t try and\ndownload them again whenever it\nloads. It\u2019s just there, instantly.\nBut these benefits obviously have\nthe occasional sacrifice with them.\nIn order to ensure that the app loads\nas quickly as possible, images are\nnot downloaded together with them.\nThis means that the app downloads\nthe images again each time it\nloads. This has both advantages\nand disadvantages. The major\nadvantage is that it saves memory,\nensuring that the Felix app doesn\u2019t\ntake an unreasonable amount of\nspace on your phone. The obvious\ndisadvantage is that images don\u2019t\nappear instantly.\nOne big change to the new edition\nof the app is the ability to read articles\nwhile offline (without images).\nAs long as the article has been\ndownloaded to the app (the latest\ncontent can be downloaded using the\ntraditional \u201cpull-to-refresh\u201d feature\nin the table), you can relax with the\nknowledge that it can be read even\nwhen you aren\u2019t connected to the\nInternet.\nSo what else can you do on the new\nFelix app? You can access profile pages\nfor all of the Felix section editors, and\nuse that to contact them with any\ncomments, feedback or suggestions\nthat you may have for their section.\nIt\u2019s easy to get to this page; just swipe\nto get to the right sidebar, and click\non the section editor you wish to talk\nto.\nThere is a search feature, which\nallows you to search for articles based\non article name, article teaser, author\nname or author username. To access\nthis incredibly useful feature just\nswipe to get the left sidebar and click\non \u201cSearch for an Article\u201d.\nWhen viewing an article, there are\nmany things you can do. You can\nsend the link for the article by email\nto a friend. There is also a button\nthat opens Safari and takes you to\nthe comment section of the article,\nso that you can have your say, or\nsee what others are saying about the\narticle. And of course, you can access\nprofile pages of each of the authors of\nthe article.\nFelix is always looking to improve\nthe way that it presents content to\n\"The\ndifferences\nare obvious\nfrom the\nstart\"\n\"One of the\nfirst things\nyou notice\nis the\nspeed\"\nyou, our esteemed readers. If there is\na change you want us to make to the\napp, or indeed anything we do, please\ndon\u2019t hesitate to contact us. The best\nway to offer feedback about the app\nwould be to leave a review on Apple.\nBut if you want your comments\nto be aired in a slightly less public\nenvironment, please email kmw13@\nimperial.ac.uk with any suggestions.\nThe Felix app is available to download\nfrom the iPhone App Store. If you have\nyour smartphone handy, you can get it\nfrom the QR Code in the advert below.\nKUNAL WAGLE\nFELIX DEVELOPER\nGet the new Felix\nApp for iPhone\ntoday!\n\n"

Photo: climatica.org.uk\nLauren Ratcliffe on doom, gloom and the sixth mass-extinction\n\"The start\nof the\nAnthropocene\nwas at the\nstart of the\nIndustrial\nRevolution.\"\nSunset for the Holocene\nLast week scientists confirmed\nthat we have entered a new\ngeological era called the\nAnthropocene. To put this into\ncontext the last epoch, known\namongst geologists as the Holocene,\nbegan around 11,700 years ago after\nthe Pleistocene, whose beginning\nwas punctuated by the wide-spread\nmass extinctions of large megafauna\n\u2013 animals weighing over 40kg \u2013\napparently due to the synergistic\nimpact of both climate change\nand the colonisation of mankind,\nwhose populations during this time\nquickly spread across the world from\nAfrica across to South America and\nAustralia.\nLike an invasive species mankind\ngradually dominated the landscape,\nspecies therein and Earth\u2019s energy\nfluxes. The proposed current\nAnthropocene epoch is defined as an\nage where this spread and expansion\nof human populations during the\nHolocene and present day has had,\nand continues to have, a widespread\ninfluence over the planet. The precise\nbeginning of this era, however, has\nbeen heavily debated. Exactly when\ndid humans start being the main\ndrivers of environmental change?\nA destructive new dawn\nSince the late 17th\ncentury it has\nbeen recognised that mankind has\nhad a disproportionate effect on\nEarth\u2019s systems, but pinning down\na precise turning point along the\nplanet\u2019s timeline has proved to be\ndifficult.\nMany geologists have suggested that\nthe beginning of the Anthropocene\nwas at the start of the Industrial\nRevolution, while others suggest it\nstarted even further back during the\ndawn of agriculture.\nLast week a group of scientists\nagreed that the HoloceneAnthropocene boundary should be\ndefined by the first A-bomb test in\n1945, which carried radionucleotides\ninto the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The\npresence of these radioactive\nelements ties closely with other\nlarge-scale changes brought about by\nmankind.\nTriggered after World War II, the\nGreen Revolution pushed to intensify\nagriculture and converted pristine\nhabitats to crop and pasture land in\norder to crank up food production.\nThe global transformation of land\nfor agricultural use has been forecast\nto take up over half the world\u2019s land\nsurface by 2050.\nTo increase efficiency and yields a\nmyriad of fertilisers, insecticides and\npesticides began to be mass-produced\nand extensively used with disastrous\nconsequences for native wildlife.\nThe imprint of these agro-chemicals can still be seen today;\nrecently corn farming in the USA has\ntaken over the landscape to meet the\ndemand for biofuel production.\nThis in turn has caused fertiliser\nrun-off into the Mississippi River\nand the mass deaths of marine life in\nthe Gulf of Mexico due to nutrient\nenrichment. Furthermore, a rise\nin commerce and international\ntransport has relocated non-native\nspecies into new habitats, such as\nthe infamous Cane toad in Australia\nwhich has since dominated and\ndestroyed native communities.\nEn-route to a sixth mass\nextinction?\nYou don\u2019t need much imagination\nto envision how humans have\nappropriated the landscape \u2013 just\nlook around you. Mankind has\nhistorically exploited, manipulated\nand destroyed parts of Earth, often\nwithout thought of the consequences\nfor other species or long-term\nrepercussions for humanity. This has\nled to what scientists suggest is the\nbeginning of a sixth mass extinction.\nAgain, let us put this into context.\nAs a whole, over the last 3.5 billion\nyears since the beginnings of\nphotosynthesis and life on earth,\napproximately 4 billion species have\nroamed, swum, flown and giggled\ntheir way across this planet. 99%\nof these species have subsequently\ngone extinct, demonstrating just how\ncommon extinction is; however, this\nis over a very long time and is usually\nbalanced by speciation.\nIn contrast, the \u2018big five\u2019 mass\nextinction events are times in Earth\u2019s\nhistory where extinction rates\nwere far greater than normal, often\ndefined as times where over 75% of\nspecies were lost. These include the\ninfamous Cretaceous-Tertiary mass\nextinction event around 66 million\nyears ago, when we waved goodbye to\nthe dinosaurs and around a quarter of\nall other species.\nNormally extinction rates are\nactually much lower than this, with\nan average 1 extinction/million\nspecies/year. However, estimates of\ncurrent extinction rates range from\n100-1000 times this background\nrate and are projected to reach the\nsame magnitude as the \u2018big five\u2019 mass\nextinctions within three centuries.\nSo the future is not looking so\nbright, and the rapid expansion of\nmankind\u2019s populations and our\nexploitation of Earth\u2019s resources\nhas continued mostly unchecked,\nbringing us all into a new era of global\ndestruction.\nSunrise and sustainability\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom,\nI hasten to add \u2013 and you probably\nknew most of this already, or at least\nhad a hunch. The introduction of\ngovernment environmental policies\nand monitoring is reducing the\nimpact of some of mankind\u2019s damage\nto the planet, for instance in the case\nof agro-chemical regulation.\nIn addition, increased\nunderstanding is enabling scientists\nto better inform global decision\nmakers. The Lima Climate Change\nConference in Peru late last year\nreached an agreement to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions, in order to\nlimit the global temperature increase\nto 2\u00ba Celsius above current levels.\nFurthermore, the Convention on\nBiological Diversity have set out\nspecific targets \u2013 Aichi biodiversity\ntargets \u2013 to be achieved by 2020.\nThese include the transformation\nof 17% of terrestrial land and 10%\nof coastal and marine areas into\nprotected areas.\nSo we now know that the\nAnthropocene era has arrived. What\nhappens next will depend on our\nresponse to environmental change\nand a movement towards a geological\nera defined not by mankind\u2019s\ndestruction but by our sustainable\nuse of the planet.\n\"Current\nextinction\nrates are\nprojected to\nreach the same\nmagnitude as\nthe 'big five'\nmass\nextinctions.\"\n\n"

So I decided\non Mount Rinjani on Lombok, a\ntreacherous three day hike, to be\ncompleted before passing out on the\nneighbouring Gili islands.\nLombok is just a couple of hours\neast of Bali by speedboat, and a lot\nmore chilled. Truth be told, I think\nthis is the Indonesia a lot of people\nare seeking when they head to Bali,\nbut miss as they remain too glued to\nthe buzzwords and trodden paths.\nMany make it as far as the Gilis,\nthree small islands just off Lombok\u2019s\nnorthwest coast, but venturing\nfurther out is certainly worth the trip;\nthere\u2019s excellent surf and beaches,\nuntouched villages and countryside,\nand \u2013 of course \u2013 a massive looming\nvolcano to be climbed. Some would\nargue that Balinese hospitality is\nunrivalled, and appears to dissipate\nquite quickly as you move away from\nthe island, but I didn\u2019t find this to\nbe the case at all. After sparking up a\nconversation with a couple of Polish\nmedics on the boat over from Bali we\nheaded to book the tour and retired\nearly ahead of a 4am start.\nThe first day was a somewhat\nforgiving seven hour stroll, partly\ndown to the stretch being non-technical, but mostly down to us\nbeing well rested, having exerted no\nenergy over the days leading up to\nthe trip. It\u2019s mostly gentle incline\nthrough meadows and forest until the\nlast couple of hours up to the crater\nrim, which is slightly steeper incline\nbut still perfectly doable. Here we\nset up camp for the night, indulging\nin tasty food by a roaring campfire,\nsoaking in the views of the gorgeous\ncrater lake below over a tasty sunset.\nI\u2019ll admit that from here the summit\nlooked pretty close, and as the day\nhad been almost too easy, I heavily\nunderestimated what was yet to come.\nAfter a solid eight hours sleep it was\n2am, and so we began to work towards\nthe summit in time for sunrise. To\ndescribe this final stretch will still\ndo it no justice: despite being only\n3800 metres, I\u2019d say it rivalled the\n6200 metre Huayna Potosi climb I\ncompleted in Bolivia last year. The\nstretch to the summit from the crater\nrim is essentially a massive volcanic\nsand dune; for every three steps you\ntake up, you side back down two, a\ndisheartening state of affairs lasting\nthree to four hours. In any case, the\neventual views are worth it, as you\u2019re\nrewarded with epic panoramas on\nboth sides \u2013 Bali and the Gilis behind\nthe crater lake to the west, and a\nscorching sun rising over Sumbawa to\nthe east.\nFollowing the summit is the gleeful\nskip back down to the crater rim\ncamp. From here it\u2019s possible to bail,\nbut we opted to venture inside the\ncrater rim, adding an extra night to\nthe trip that was certainly as much\nof a highlight as the summit itself.\nAfter three tough hours downhill,\nwe eventually reached the ethereal\nlake that had caught our attention\nsince we first made it to the rim on\nthe previous day. This was the perfect\nplace to camp, as behind the lake were\nsome picturesque hot springs, ideal\nfor chilling after nine hours of hard\ngraft.\nThe final day involves climbing\nback out of the crater and heading\ndown the other side, continuing along\na different path to avoid any route\nrepeating. It\u2019s a tolerable eight hours\nthat pass by fairly quickly, assuming\nyou\u2019re still running on the high\nfrom having managed to summit.\nFinishing up puts you in the perfect\nspot to carry on to Lombok\u2019s famed\nSenaru waterfalls, where you can kick\nback and relax. Alternatively, you\ncould head hop on a boat to another\nisland to sink a few beers and revel in\nthe fact that you survived, which is\nwhat I did. It certainly scratched my\nhiking itch and also helped to keep\nthe Bintang-induced beer belly at bay;\nif you\u2019re heading to the archipelago\nbe sure to make conquering Mount\nRinjani a top priority.\nRinjani Trekking Club \u2013\nLombok\u2019s hiking specialists\nWhen I first docked in Lombok I\nwent to have a chat with Mr Ronie\nand the gang at Rinjani Trekking\nClub (RTC), whom several sources\nhad told me were highly reputable.\nI\u2019d stress that this is the most\nimportant step that you want to get\nright; you need a reputable agency\nwith knowledgeable guides, reliable\nequipment, and decent food to keep\nyour energy levels high. RTC has all\nthree. Furthermore, they are \u2013 to my\nknowledge \u2013 the only organisation on\nLombok dedicated to conservation\nwork, organising sustainable hikes\nand also cleaning up after less\nenvironmentally-conscious groups\nalong the way.\nThey\u2019ll also give you options when\nit comes to crafting your route. If\nyou\u2019re opting to go to the summit,\nwhich I\u2019d strongly suggest, then\nyou\u2019ll want to take the route outlined\nabove: commencing in Sembalun and\nfinishing in Senaru. The great thing\nabout this route is that it\u2019s so well\nstructured; you get the summit out of\nthe way while your energy levels are\nhigh, get to camp at the crater lake\n(not possible otherwise), and finish\nat some serene waterfalls rather than\narid savannah. Hiking with RTC\ncertainly made this experience; their\nprofessionalism coupled with their\nethical approach to hiking makes\nthem the obvious choice for your hike\nup Mount Rinjani.\nFor more information visit\ninfo2lombok.com or contact the Editor.\n\"Adding an\nextra night\nto the trip\nwas certainly\nas much of a\nhighlight...\"\nAn extra day brings you to the gorgeous lakeside completened with hot\nspring Photo: Chris Richardson\n\n"

Factors in this\nyear\u2019s survey include water and\ncarbon reduction, staff and student\nengagement, sustainable food\nsourcing, and ethical investment\npolicies.\nThis year, Plymouth University\ncame top of the table, while Imperial\nCollege ranked 112 of 151. Last year\nImperial came 113rd of 152. In a\nbreakdown, People & Planet gave\nImperial a score of 0% in categories\nof \u201cEnvironmental Policy\u201d, \u201cEthical\nInvestment\u201d, \u201cWorkers Rights\u201d,\n\u201cSustainable Food\u201d, and \u201cWaste\nReduction\u201d.\nInstitutions are allocated \u2018degree\nclassifications\u2019, with Imperial\nattaining a \u2018third class\u2019.

There,\nI\u2019ve said it. When you grow up\nspending every waking moment\nwith \u2018theatrical types\u2019 who sit around\nreciting ballads from Les Miserables,\nmusicals can make you hate them.\nListening to song after whiny song\nwhich all fail to add any story to the\nshow, and with music which is at\nbest a notch above mediocre, for me,\nmusical theatre is a curse.\nThat said, as much as I despair\nadmitting it, there is the odd bit of\nmusical theatre I\u2019m quite partial\nto (big U-turn I know, bear with\nme). Chicago can\u2019t really go wrong;\nBilly Elliot was a good tory-bashing\nlaugh, and Cabaret, well that\u2019s just\npretty awesome (although it\u2019s a push\neven calling it musical theatre). The\ndifference is that in these musicals,\nthe scenes between the songs don\u2019t\nfeel like they\u2019ve only been included\nto give the band a break. A real plot,\nwith interesting characters and,\nto top it off, good music is such a\nrarity in musical theatre. So, with\nall that considered, this week I went,\nvoluntarily, off to see the Morphic\nGraffiti production of Batboy.\nBatboy is about a boy, who is a bit\nof a bat, and a bit of a boy. In what\nfeels like the deleted scenes from a\nlow-end episode of South Park, the\nshow opens in the beautiful town of\nHope Falls (or High Falls\u2026 I can\u2019t\nremember), and a delightful group of\nfundamentalist Christians stumble\nacross what can only be called a mini-Dracula. Right from the get go we\nare greeted to a huge, spectacular, if\npretty dull opening number. With a\nset not far off a west end stage, and\nthe costume and lighting to match,\nall the indicators are that of a high\nend production. Directed by Luke\nFredericks for Morphic Graffiti and\nproduced by Paul Taylor-Mills Ltd,\nthe team behind Batboy is stunning\nfor a small theatre show.\nThe problem is that in musicals,\nall the singing and the dancing and\nthe band mean that actors have to\nwear microphones (another thing I\nhate). In principal this would have\nbeen ok, but, whether it was the fault\nof the American accents or the tech,\nI couldn\u2019t understand a word. For\nanyone who has ever been on stage,\ntwo of the first things you are taught\nare to perform towards the audience,\nand diction. Not for the sake of it,\nbut because above everything else,\nthe audience have to understand\nwhat you are saying. So it was for the\nwhole first half, in which we see a\ntypical American family take in and\nteach Batboy, that all the big musical\nnumbers sounded like a glorious\nchorus of mumbling.\nSomewhere between a college\nhumour sketch and a tame version\nof the Book of Mormon, the first\nhalf of Batboy doesn\u2019t really know\nwhat it wants to be. Having jumped\naround the stage with almost no\npurpose for the first thirty minutes\nof the show, in the space of one song\nBatboy suddenly develops into a well-spoken, intelligent and (somewhat)\ncaring member of the family. With\nhis newfound wisdom, Batboy\ndesperately wants to be accepted into\nthe community, but of course not all\ngoes to plan.\nUsually, I\u2019d leave out the rest of the\nstory not wanting to spoil it, but this\ntime there isn\u2019t really much plot to\ntalk about. The first half continues\nin much the same vein, stuck in\nsecond gear with little prospect of the\nshow picking up. It\u2019s a shame since\nthe production value of the show\nis particularly impressive for such\na small venue, but the mixture of\nrandom serious moments and a white\nguy rapping (badly) makes the whole\nfirst half feel oddly ridiculous.\nAs you can imagine, I did not have\nhuge hopes for after the interval\nbut remarkably, the second half\nopened with vastly more energy and\nenthusiasm than before. A number\nof particularly funny moments and\nan almost interesting story finally\ngave me something to smile about.\nAlthough the Christian revival scene\nfits all the secular clich\u00e9s, the music\n(a jazzy number with a bit of life) had\nmy foot tapping away to the almost\ncertain irritation of the guy sitting\nnext to me (he seemed to enjoy the\nshow even less than I did). Followed\nby a few raunchy scenes between\nBatboy and his pseudo adopted\nsister, and a hilarious appearance by\n\u201cmother nature\u201d, the show reached\na somewhat sexual climax that the\nsecond half certainly deserved.\nTopped off by an amusing twist at\nthe end, the show finished on a high\nwith the only regret being that it took\nthem over an hour to try and impress\nus.\nThe cast need to be given their due\ncredit when it comes to performing\nin musical numbers. Although few\nperformances really stood out, more\nexperienced members of the cast such\nas Lauren Ward and Matthew White\nplaying Mr & Mrs Parker came across\nas more comfortable on stage and\nfelt more convincing when singing\nand acting. That is not to say that the\nperformances of Batboy, played by\nRob Compton and of Shelley Parker\nplayed by Georgina Hagen did not\nimpress. However, too many musicals\ncompromise on a performer\u2019s ability\nto sing, act or dance. It takes an\nincredible performer to pull off all\nthree parts of musical theatre well\nand although the cast of Batboy gave\nit a good shot, such performers are in\nparticularly short supply.\nSo the question is would I go see the\nshow again? No, probably not. I hate\nmusical theatre and Batboy really\ndoesn\u2019t fulfil many of the criteria\nwhich would make me change my\nmind about a musical. It is funny, and\nat times even the music is good. But if\nyou\u2019re like me, as good as the second\nhalf was, the first is just too boring to\nvoluntarily sit through. As is often\nthe case, large chunks of the audience\nabsolutely loved the show; I guess I\u2019ve\njust got too many of the critical genes\nin my family. I\u2019m just way too boring\nfor musical theatre (give me Hamlet\nany day). But if you\u2019re not like me\nand actually like to have a good time,\nshould you go see Batboy? I don\u2019t\nknow. Go watch it and if you loved it,\nI will happily take the credit - if you\nhated it, I told you so.\nBat Boy: The Musical runs until\n31st\nJanuary.

    "content": "6 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n23.01.2015\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe rise of Imperial Facebook\npages spans several years, but\ndespite sprouting a number of\ndifferent pages they are all for pretty\nmuch of the same audience. These include such as Imperial College Secrets,\nSpotted: Central Library and Humans\nof Imperial, some of which allow students to anonymously submit content\nto be posted on the page, with others\nhaving admins that track down and\ncurate content themselves.\nThe first page to gain serious\ntraction was Imperial Memes back\nin 2012, with posts accumulating\nup to 200 likes apiece and students\ncommenting and submitting\nconstantly. The page became inactive\nwhen the moderator graduated the\nfollowing year, although by then\nmore pages were springing up and\nattracting thousands of likes by\nstudents across campuses and year\ngroups.\nThe pages\u2019 popularities seem to\ncoincide with holidays or revision\nperiods, and understandably so.\nImperial College Secrets, which\nbegan in September 2013, has only\nrecently exploded as the Christmas\nholidays came to an end, with posts\ndramatically increasing in frequency\non the page and the number of likes\nincreasing by a few thousand in a\nmatter of weeks.\nThe obvious draw of these pages are\nthe sense of community they provide:\nImperial College Secrets in particular\nhas attracted a lot of students posting\nabout mental health difficulties, with\nother students posting comments of\nsupport.\nSlightly more bizarre was also the\nattempt to organise some sort of\norgy for students complaining about\nsexual frustration, but generally\nthe posts have been sincere, if not\nsaddening to hear about students\nstruggling with various issues.\nOther posts have not been so\nsavoury or positive: one included a\nlink to a photo of someone\u2019s faecal\nmatter in a sink, which was viewed\nhundreds of times. Another post is\nabout medical student who admits to\nsleeping with a consultant, with many\nmore posters admitting to drug use,\nillicit sex, hatred for room/hall mates,\nand a general apathy for Imperial as a\nUniversity.\nA shocking number seem keen to\ndiscuss ejaculate, whether it is in food,\nshampoo bottles or a jar kept on the\nwindow shelf.\nIt is easy to underestimate the\nnumber of students that are actively\ninteracting with the page; despite\nmany posts on Imperial College\nSecrets attracting tens of likes, some\nof the polls posted, such as \u201cWhich\nBiology lecturer would you sleep\nwith?\u201d have seen over two hundred\nvotes (Tim Simpson was the winner of\nthat, by the way).\nThese admins can also be held as\nliable for the content posted online,\nas propagating lies or slander to an\naudience is considered defamatory\nand can even be sued as a result.\nEven if the admin doesn\u2019t write the\ndefamatory comment, the fact that\nthey republished the material to an\naudience, regardless in size, leaves\nthem liable under the Defamatory\nAct 2013.\nFelix investigated exactly what\nCollege could do about these pages\nshould they become unsavoury.\nA spokesperson said that users\nof College\u2019s IT facilities must not\n\u201cdisplay, store, receive or transmit\nimages or text which could be\nconsidered offensive e.g. material of\na sexual, pornographic, paedophilic,\nsexist, racist, libellous, threatening,\ndefamatory, of a terrorist nature\nor likely to bring the College into\ndisrepute.\u201d\nThey continued: \u201cWhere\nappropriate, the College will\ninvestigate and may take action\nunder its procedure for dealing with\nstudent disciplinary offences.\u201d\nThey also told us that written\nconsent should be sought from\nCollege to use \u201cImperial College,\u201d\neither alone or as part of a longer\nname. This also extends to the crest,\nand applies to both commercial uses\nof both of these elements and social\npurposes too.\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of all\nmembers of the College to ensure that\npublications and communications\nbearing the name Imperial College\nLondon should not contain material\nthat is inaccurate or detrimental to\nthe good reputation of the College.\u201d\nSuch pages are not unique to\nImperial, and in fact, some aren\u2019t\neven run by Imperial students. The\npage Things Imperial Students Don\u2019t\nSay is ran by the Tab HQ, the national\nstudent tabloid group, alongside\nImperial Facebook pages: the good,\nthe bad, and the downright hilarious\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF\nmany other \u201cThings students don\u2019t\nsay\u201d pages for other Universities.\nSome have also attracted a lot of\nbad press in the past, especially those\nthat became popular nationwide.\nLaura Bates, the founder of the\nEverydaySexism project in the\nGuardian last year, called out the\n\u201cSpotted\u201d pages, which were very\npopular with Universities nationwide.\nThese pages often contained posts\nfrom students about others, they had\n\u201cspotted\u201d in the library, although\nmany people were photographed\nwithout permission and then posted\non the page for thousands to see.\nBates said the pages were\ndemonstrative of \u201cObjectification,\nharassment and misogyny.\u201d She\noutlined how female students felt\nawkward or nervous going to places\nwhich had these pages associated with\nthem.\nRate Your Shag pages also attracted\nthe attention of the national media in\n2013 after Facebook removed them\nbecause of naming students in full.\nLoughborough University warned\nstudents that they would be kicked\noff their course if they were found to\nbe posting on the pages.\nThe pages aren\u2019t limited to\nFacebook either: there has been\nseveral Twitter pages of the same\nnature, although it seems students\naren\u2019t ready to move to Twitter just\nyet. The anonymous twitter account\nImperial Gossip Girl (@ICGossipGal)\nhas currently 54 followers, and has\nonly tweeted 23 times.\nNo doubt more pages will spring up\nin the future, probably in conjunction\nwith the exam season, although for\nthe time being it seems that the\nniche is pretty saturated with pages\naddressing pretty much all aspects of\na student\u2019s life at Imperial.\nThat\u2019s not to say the majority of the\nposts on the Imperial Facebook pages\naren\u2019t funny or entertaining. Many\nof the posts on Imperial pages seem\nto capture the ethos of the university\nvery well and make for a great\nprocrastination tool, if nothing else.\nIf you ever wanted to scroll endlessly\nthrough snippets into the lives of\nImperial student, these pages are\nprobably the best place to start.\n\n"

    "content": "42 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n23.01.2015\nTravel\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk Travel Editor Yung Nam Cheah\nChris Richardson ditches the beaches and heads for the hills\nUp in Ubud: Dabbling the delights in\nBali\u2019s undisputed cultural capital\nBali: the four letters roll\neloquently off the tongue, and\nimmediately conjure up images\nof beautiful beaches, bronze bods, and\nbottled Bintang. But a stone\u2019s throw\n\u2013 literally one hour by shuttle bus \u2013\ninto the island\u2019s core teleports you\nto a different kind of paradise: the\nkind that featured heavily in Eat Pray\nLove, and the kind that continuously\ncaptures the imagination of yogis and\nchill-seekers from across the globe.\nAnd with its seas of green, cooler\nclimates, and cultural delights, it\u2019s\neasy to see why. Welcome to Ubud.\nThere\u2019s much to be said for Balinese\nculture; the rich history, exquisite\ncuisine, and warm hospitality are\nall internationally renowned. They\ncertainly set Bali aside from other\nobvious tropical holiday destinations,\nand help attract repeat visitors in\ntheir droves year-on-year. With\nthat in mind, Ubud is undoubtedly\nthe island\u2019s cultural capital \u2013 a far\ncry from scruffy Kuta and trendier\nSeminyak in South Bali \u2013 and is thus\nthe obvious location in which to\nexplore the island\u2019s cultural offerings.\nSights and attractions are dotted\nover a large distance in the town and\nsurrounding villages, and given the\nlack of resident metered taxis the ojek\n(motorcycle taxi) rates are heavily\ninflated. So when you arrive, the first\nthing you\u2019ll want to do is source a\nmoped, which your accommodation\nwill be more than happy to help\nyou with. This should set you back\naround \u00a33 per day, and is the perfect\nmode of transportation for getting\nlost in Ubud\u2019s beautiful countryside,\nor stopping to check out whatever\nlocal art studio catches your eye.\nFurthermore, the area doesn\u2019t have\nthe usual reputation for bribe-thirsty\npolice officers looking to extort cash\nfrom innocent tourists, so you should\nbe able to explore unmolested.\nOnce you\u2019ve dumped your bags\nand sorted a ride, Ubud\u2019s your oyster.\nFill the sunlit hours with the area\u2019s\noutdoor sights. Start off your day with\na morning stroll along Campuhan\nRidge, a beautiful and relatively-chilled hike that stalks two rivers\nwhich eventually converge. This is\nthe infamous spot where a Javanese\npriest once sat and meditated before\ndeciding to construct a temple,\naround which the main town was first\ndeveloped. The short walk concludes\nin a small village hosting several art\nstudios offering more unique wares to\nwhat you\u2019ll find in town, and at much\nbetter rates. You should also take a\ntrip up to the Tegalalang rice terraces,\nwhich offer spectacular views of palm\ntrees set against an epic backdrop\nof staggered rice terraces. Here it\u2019s\npossible to take a tour or just amble\nthrough the paddies at your own pace.\nNo trip to Ubud would be complete\nwithout the obligatory visit to the\nSacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, a\nnature reserve and temple complex\nthat\u2019s home to countless long-tailed\nmacaques. Don\u2019t let the \u2018Sacred\u2019 or\n\u2018Sanctuary\u2019 in the name fool you: I\nthink of this more as chaos among\ntranquillity. While the temples\nand forest are certainly serene, any\nattempt at a peaceful walk is almost\nalways interrupted by one of the\nfour tribes of monkeys on regular\npatrol. Attacks occur daily, as a quick\nYouTube search will attest, and many\nof the monkeys are chock full of\nherpes B virus. Why parents let their\nyoung children feed the monkeys\nbananas is totally beyond me, but\nI guess this is just Darwin\u2019s theory\nat work. On a related note, simian\nobesity in the forest has now reached\nepic proportions. It certainly is a\nspectacle; go and check it out, but be\nsure to keep any valuables secured.\nMoving away from activities\nrequiring zealous physical exertion,\nUbud has a seemingly endless supply\nof galleries to keep you entertained.\nYour best bet is to amble through\nthe side streets and see what you\nstumble across. Of note, the Agung\nRai Museum of Art has an impressive\ncollection of Walter Spies\u2019 works,\nwhile the Neka Art Museum will\ntake you on a journey through the\ndevelopment of Balinese artistic\nstyles. Traditional Balinese dance\nshows can be found from a multitude\nof companies every night of the\nweek; these are the perfect blend of\ncostumes, choreography, and comedy,\nbacked by the sweet sounds of\nBalinese gamelan. Obviously, yoga is\none of the star attractions in Ubud; if\nyou\u2019re that way inclined, you\u2019ve come\nto the right place. Competition is\nfierce, keeping prices reasonable and\nquality high; your best bet is to find\nout the situation on the ground once\nyou arrive.\nSo that\u2019s Ubud in a nutshell. These\nare, of course, just the highlights.\nThere\u2019s many a hidden gem to be\nfound, especially if you\u2019re feeling\nadventurous. I\u2019d also say that the\nrainy season is somewhat underrated;\nthe area is a lot less crowded, room\nrates are remarkably lower, and the\nrain itself is a minor inconvenience.\nOh, and the rainy season coincides\nperfectly with the Christmas break\nand end-of-exams. For me it was\na true highlight of Indonesia, and\na destination I\u2019d strongly suggest\nmaking a focal point of your next\nholiday agenda.\nYour luxury retreat in the hills. Photo: Chris Richardson\n\"There\u2019s\nmany a\nhidden\ngem to be\nfound.\"\n\"Amori\nVilla is\nnothing\nshort of\nstunning.\"\nAmori Villa\nWith seven gorgeous suites and\nvillas set around a luscious infinity\npool that cuts dramatically into a\nplush forest, this boutique resort is\nluxury at its finest. Carefully crafted\nto provide breath-taking panoramic\nviews of the surrounding valley,\naccompanied by the soothing sounds\nof the river below, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat this paradise is a TripAdvisor\nTravellers\u2019 Choice 2014 Winner. And\ngiven it\u2019s the brainchild of a couple\nwell-versed in world travel you can\nrest assured that attention has been\npaid to the smallest of details.\nThe team of butlers provide\noutstanding personal service, whilst\nthe chefs prepare a wonderful\nselection of local and international\nfare at bargain prices. The infinity\npool is the perfect place to unwind\nafter a stroll through the rice paddies,\nbefore retiring for a massage or\nJacuzzi session. Individual villas\ncan be booked but I\u2019d recommend\nbanding together and booking out\nthe entire retreat; during my recent\nvisit I ran into a group of young\nprofessionals who\u2019d done just that\nfor an extended weekend and seemed\nto have had the best time. Look no\nfurther for somewhere to unwind for\nholiday bliss: Amori Villa is nothing\nshort of stunning.\nFind out more at amorivilla.com.\n\n"

So there was one thing\nabout them that really surprised\nme, and I possibly only noticed it\nwatching them back to back. Though\nthey are set at different times, in\ndifferent places, with vastly different\nplots, they are exceedingly similar.\nThe first and most obvious point is\nthe theme of these films. All feature\na male lead, trying desperately hard\nto be the best that they can be, to be\nsomeone who will be remembered.\nIt\u2019s the same fear that fills all three\nof these men, and the same hope.\nThe hope that after they die, they\nwill be the sort of person who is\nworth remembering, the sort of\nperson to be discussed around the\ndinner table.\nWhich is pretty similar to what\nyou find in The Theory of Everything.\nStephen Hawking\u2019s search for the\neponymous theory is portrayed\nas not only wanting to find it for\nscience, but as way to be remembered\ntoo.\nIt\u2019s a well known fact in the film\nworld that pretty much every film\nis the same. This was first made\nfamous by Blake Snyder, who wrote\na beat sheet in his book Save the Cat\n(if you\u2019ve got a free moment, take a\nlook. You will never look at films the\nsame way). It\u2019s a plot template that\nbreak films up into a nice three act\nstructure. And it can be applied to\nalmost every film, often down the\npage number on the script.\nThe thing that surprised me\nabout the three films is the not only\nhow similar they are in reaching\ntheir climactic moments, but how\nsimilar they are too. You could\nliterally switch the two scenes from\nFoxcatcher and Birdman over and the\nfilms would still make sense.\nOne of the big issues that plagues\nall three is the lack of strong females\ncharacters. It becomes harder and\nharder to make an acceptable film\nthat doesn\u2019t really feature any\nwomen. Look at the Hobbit trilogy.\nYes, there were a lot of complaints\nabout the addition of Tauriel, but\nthere would have been even more\ncomplains about the lack of females.\nSome of the Oscar nominees are\nfine, look at Felicity Jones in The\nTheory of Everything for example,\nor Keira Knightly in The Imitation\nGame. Both played strong female\ncharacters, and both received a Best\nActress nomination for their efforts.\nI was less than impressed by the\nthree I saw. Emma Stone in Birdman\nis wonderful as an actress (and a Best\nSupporting Acctress nomination\nto boot), but is not particularly well\ncharacterised. As for every other\nfemale, they barely exist other than\nfor convenience.\nIn Whiplash there is one female\ncharacter, and I still haven\u2019t worked\nwhat she added to the film, if\nanything. The only thing worse than\na bland character is a pointless one.\nFoxcatcher manages to have a\nhealthy two, but I\u2019m fairly sure\nthey were only there because this\nwas based on a true story and they\nthought they couldn\u2019t really get away\nwith not adding the characters.\nThe soundtracks are oddly similar\ntoo. All are incredibly drum heavy.\nThat makes sense in Whiplash, it\u2019s a\nfilm about a drummer after all. But\nall three films? Solo drumming is\nsomething that you don\u2019t normally\nfind in a film score, after all you\nnormally have access to an entire\norchestra so why would bother only\nhave one instrument. I was bemused\nby the fact that three films released\nat the same time had such similar\nmusic.\nI feel that it wouldn\u2019t be fair\nto pick apart these films without\nmention how wonderful they are.\nThey are well made, interesting\nand enjoyable, fully deserving the\nrecognition that have received.\nEach takes a subject with a fairly\nlimited fanbase (drumming, theatre\nand wrestling respectively), and\nmake them interesting to much\nwider audience.\nPerhaps it is only because I saw all\nthree at the same time that the seem\nso similar or perhaps I am just being\npedantic, but the more I think about\nit, the more similar they seem to me.\nPhoto: Alejandro G.

As the queue\nof hopeful students extended onto\nthe Sherfield walkway, members of\nIE handed out flyers \u201cguaranteeing\u201d\nentry to the event.\nOnce first year Maths students\nfinally left Clore lecture theatre, the\nroom was inundated with students\nfrom all courses and years.\nThe ambience was decidedly electric\nand students were very excited. Some\ntried to save seats for their friends,\nonly to be told by members of IE that,\ndue to high demand, no seats could be\nsaved for anyone \u2013 places were to be\nallocated on a first-come-first-served\nbasis only.\nOnce the crowd was finally seated,\nNick began his inspirational talk.\nHe came across as laid back and\nconfident, and was clearly used to\nspeaking in front of large crowds of\npeople.\nThe 30-minute speech saw Nick\ntake the audience on the journey\ntowards the highly successful\ncompany that ASOS is today.\nThe fashion retailer, established in\n2000, was originally called As Seen\non Screen, which featured links to\nwebsites where people could buy the\nfurniture and clothes featured in\ntheir favourite movies and sitcoms.\nAt the time, Nick bought the domain\nname for just \u00a350. The website gained\nrevenue from featuring relevant\nbrands on the website. Eventually,\nNick and his business partner (his\nbrother) decided to source the actual\nproducts and sell them for a mark up.\nASOS saw a big change in its\nbusiness model after it hired a new\nbuyer, who used to work for Topshop.\nThe new buyer sourced the most\ndemanded items from wholesale\nstores around London to be sold\nonline.\nWith growing success and noticing\nthat the fashion side of the business\nwas performing better, the firm saw\na transition from retailing clothing\nand homewares to just accessories and\nclothes.\nThe brand encountered a setback\nin 2005 when a nearby fuel depot\nexploded near the ASOS warehouse,\ncausing the online business to close\nfor six weeks, with a loss of stock\nworth \u00a35 million.\nASOS\u2019s target customers are young\npeople in their twenties, particularly\nwomen, who are fashion conscious.\nSince its founding, the business has\nslowly accumulated an impressive\nportfolio of huge brands.\nDuring the Q&A session after\nHundreds queue to see ASOS CEO\nNick Roberston give a talk in Huxley\nCecile Borkhataria goes to the event hosted by IC Entrepreneurs\nhis talk, Nick Roberston said \u201cfive\nyears ago, if you\u2019d have told me that\nRiver Island would be sold at ASOS, I\nwouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u201d\nIndeed, the fashion retail website\nstarted out supplying smaller,\nindependent brands (such as Lipsy\nwhen it was first introduced),\nand as traffic grew, the business\ngained traction and larger global\nbrands began to join the businesses\nrepertoire.\nThe ASOS \u2018free returns\u2019 policy\nhas been a significant aspect of the\nbrand\u2019s success, and Nick said the\ndecision to implement it in 2006 was\nsimple, as he thought he should \u201cgive\nthe customers what they want\u201d. Nick\nemphasised that this was a marketing\nspend that improved customer\nloyalty, and is important as 35% of all\norders are returned.\nThe next priorities for ASOS are to\noptimise its app, as 30% of its sales are\nmade through a mobile device.\nAlong with mobile device\noptimisation, Nick hopes to\ntransition from spending huge\nsums for Google search engine\noptimisation, to building the ASOS\nbrand and media even more.\nWhen I asked Nick if he would\nconsider opening ASOS stores in the\nfuture, he said that he\u2019s been tempted\nto secure attractive retail spaces,\nbut would prefer to stay online, as\nmost young people spend a large\nproportion of their fashion budgets\non the internet.\nNick proves that you don\u2019t have\nto be a whiz kid to found a hugely\nsuccessful business: he got a D and\nan E at A-Level, yet ASOS has an\nestimated worth of \u00a3159 million.\nAs the UK\u2019s largest independent\nonline and fashion retailer, ASOS has\nrevolutionised the fashion industry\nand continues to grow rapidly.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\nFELIX 23.01.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWe are not standing up for free speech\nThe Comment section of\nlast week\u2019s Felix made\nfor interesting reading,\nunsurprisingly, the writers for the\nmost part choosing to focus on the\nCharlie Hebdo massacre, which has\nbeen dominating headlines these\npast weeks. I\u2019ll start by saying that\nthere were good ideas expressed in\nthose articles, and in the centre-left\u2019s\nmedia response as a whole, however,\nI believe that Felix and the rest of the\nmainstream media is wrong not to\nstand up for freedom of expression\nand publish the cartoons.\nFirstly, there\u2019s no question that\nCharlie Hebdo is a crass and offensive\npublication \u2013 albeit that particularly\ndelightful brand of crass and\noffensive, reminiscent of South Park,\nwhich achieves impartiality through\nindiscriminate lampooning. They\nshine a light on hypocrisy, whether\nit can be found in synagogues (they\nwere ferociously critical of Israel\u2019s\nbombing of Gaza), churches or\nmosques. They have also always been\nextremely disparaging of the far right\nbigotry which many seem quick to\nassume they represent, few having\ntaken the time to look at anything\nother than their cartoons of Muslims.\nA quick perusal of their past\npublications is enough to reveal that\nthe magazine \u2013 whilst undeniably\nunsubtle \u2013 is satirical, as well as\nmorally sophisticated and consistent,\nmeaning that obtuse comparisons\nof the cartoons to Nazi propaganda\nare neither apt nor helpful. I\u2019m not\nhere primarily to defend Charlie\nHebdo, however I think that the\ninterpretation of the \u2018Je suis Charlie\u2019\ncampaign as agreement with\nanything in particular published\nby the magazine would be a\nmisunderstanding.\nI feel that the mistakes that liberal\njournalists and intellectuals have\nmade can often be traced back to\ngood intentions \u2013 they are wary of\ncriticising the beliefs of minorities\nfor fear of inciting or contributing to\npersecution, and are very conscious\nof the historical (and contemporary)\noppression of foreign peoples by\nWestern powers. This attitude\nbecomes dangerous when it stifles\ncriticism of virulent ideologies\nthrough reflexively and uncritically\ndefending any position, simply by\nvirtue of the fact that it is held by a\nminority. Basically, the existence of\npersecution against Muslims doesn\u2019t\nmean that Muslim ideologies and\nsensibilities need defending at every\nturn.\nCharlie Hebdo satirises anyone and\neveryone, and I think that it\u2019s plain\nto see that the groups which show the\ngreatest resistance to that practice,\neven going so far as to threaten and\nexact violent retribution, are those\nmost in need of it. Not only because\ntheir sensitivity is usually a product\nof the weakness of their position, but\nbecause if men with guns tell us not\nto do something perfectly harmless\nand we comply \u2013 even though it\u2019s\nclearly the safest and easiest option,\nand many of us may not even have\nthought to perform the offensive\naction in the first place \u2013 we have\ncapitulated.\nThey go away (for now) secure in\nthe knowledge that violence has\nonce again trumped peaceful debate.\nOthers watch, and eagerly load their\nweapons. The cartoons may not mean\nmuch by themselves, we may even\nfind them distasteful and crude, but\ndemonstrating to the world that the\nwestern media can be silenced with\nsuch threats weakens our credibility\nwhen it comes to criticising extremist\nMuslim ideology on other topics \u2013\nhomophobia, misogyny and sectarian\nconflict to name a few \u2013 of far\ngreater importance. It is important\nto try to get along with people and\nembrace their ideas, but some ideas\nare genuinely terrible and need to be\ncriticised, whether in cartoon form or\nany other, and doing so isn\u2019t bigotry.\nI am sure that many will object to\nmy assertion that publishing these\ncartoons is \u2018perfectly harmless\u2019.\nOf course they don\u2019t exactly fly\nin the face of visual stereotypes,\nand it would be something of an\nunderstatement to say Muslims\nhave objected to them on religious\ngrounds. But the truth is it isn\u2019t\nreasonable to be offended by satire\nto this extent. Relative to the violent\nresponse amongst extremist Muslims\nto offences of this kind \u2013 and the\n\u2018deafening silence\u2019 in the wake of\nthat violence we see all too often in\nmoderates \u2013 the drawing of satirical\ndoodles is completely harmless, and\nasserting anything else is lunacy.\nIt doesn\u2019t make ethical sense to\ncomplain that a murder victim was\n\u2018needlessly offensive\u2019 for insulting\ntheir attacker\u2019s haircut, and doing so\nwould veer dangerously close to an\nattempt to justify the crime. And yet\nwe see this being argued all too often,\nin the Felix last week as well as in the\nliberal media as a whole.\nThose moderate Muslims who\nshare our desire for freedom should\nunderstand why we have to make this\nstatement and print these cartoons,\nand that we mean no particular\noffence to them in doing so. I would\nsay the same thing to moderate Jews\nor Christians if terrorists of their\nfaith were willing to kill journalists in\nthe name of censorship.\nIn the long run, if we don\u2019t stand\nup for the ideals that our society has\nstrived to institutionalise over the\npast centuries then we risk losing\nthem. And if we don\u2019t defend them in\nprint or by other peaceful means then\nwe allow it to get to the stage where we\nmust do so with police snipers, as was\nthe case in France. So that\u2019s why Felix,\nand every media publication with any\nrespect for the enlightenment values\nso central to our society, should have\npublished those cartoons.\nMany publications, including Felix, chose not to print the cartoons. Photo: ddinews.gov.in\nTHOMAS MANFORD\nCOMMENT WRITER\nThe mainstream media is not respecting the enlightenment of society\n\"They shine\na light on\nhypocrisy\"\n\"...if we\ndon\u2019t\ndefend\nthem in\nprint...\nthen we\nallow it\nto get to\nthe stage\nwhere we\nmust do so\nwith police\nsnipers\"\n\n"

Positively\nsteeped in history and tradition, it is\none of the capital\u2019s oldest music halls,\nand one of the very few surviving\nones that retains its original features.\nWith such an illustrious legacy, it is\nunderstandable that some musicians\nmay feel nervous when they emerge\nonto the stage.\nHowever, last week saw the London\ndebut of a performer who is no\nstranger to treading the boards, and\ncommanded the audience with poise\nand grace.\nMichael Malarkey may be best\nknown for playing the role of Enzo,\nthe handsome anti-hero of the\nAmerican drama series The Vampire\nDiaries, but has actually been writing\nmusic for the best part of a decade.\nWhile this combination of music and\ndrama may sound strange, Malarkey\nis part of a rich tradition of actor-musicians; after all, what would Kylie\nMinogue be without Neighbours,\nDrake without Degrassi?

It\nliterally blew my mind when I first\nheard \u2018Rain Dogs\u2019.\nAs far as acting inspiration goes,\nI\u2019ve had the pleasure of working\nwith a wealth of incredible actors,\ndirectors and mentors over the years\nand it\u2019s fair to say that they have all\ninfluenced me in different ways.

Trust me when I tell\nyou that I wasted an extraordinary\namount of my school years playing\nthis game. It was a pretty epic game.\nHowever, it was released back in\n2005, 10 years ago. Therefore the\nannouncements that the next\nBattlefront is coming this year have\nfilled me with excitement as well as\ntrepidation. Excitement, because\nobviously I get to see a new version of\na game I hold dearly and trepidation\nbecause this new version is going to be\nproduced by EA.\nThe teaser trailer really did a lot to\nhype the game, and I just hope that\nthis won\u2019t be a re-skin of Battlefield 4.\nThis game is expected on all platforms\nand will be released with the new Star\nWars film in late 2015.\nThe Next Big Gaming Trend: Space Simulations\nMaximilian Eggl on why No Man\u2019s Sky, Star Citizen and Elite are the future\nThe past few years, ever since\nthe release and subsequent re-release of DayZ, we have had an\nexplosion of Zombie survival MMOs.\nIn fact, I am surprised when there is\na month when I don\u2019t see news about\na new one. However, it has become\nquite tiring, since there are only\nso many times I can wake up on an\nabandoned beach. It seems that most\nof the gaming market is coming to\nthis conclusion, as we have reached a\nsaturation point. Looking at upcoming releases, I feel that the next big\ngaming will be the open world Space\nSim.\nBeing an astronaut is a dream that\nmost kids have, and I can promise you\nI was one of them. However, given\nthat most of us enjoy a pint or two/\ndon\u2019t have a pilot\u2019s license or enjoy\n20/20 vision it is not really that likely.\nFurthermore, the kind of space travel\nas repeated in the science fiction\nJust Cause 3\nThe grappling hook, parachute\nand crazy physics have all\nentered gaming culture. Now\nit seems we will get to use them once\nagain in the newest Just Cause, in\naddition to a wingsuit. While the\ngame mechanics will remain mostly\nthe same, the location and story are\ncompletely new. The new map is on\npar in terms of size with that of JC2,\nbut you now have the ability to explore\nsubterranean caves. Furthermore, its\nlocated in the Mediterranean and you\nreturn as Rico to battle against the\ndictator General Di Ravello.\nGiven the stance that there will be no\nmicrotransactions in this game, I have\nhope that this game will deliver on all\nits promise. This game will be available\non all platforms with no exact release\ndate at the moment.\nZelda Wii U\nLegendofZeldaisthatone\nfranchisethateveryonehas\nheardof,andanyonewhocalls\nthemselvesagamerhasplayedatleast\noneoftheentriesofthisjuggernaut.\nThereforealotisridingonZelda Wii U\n(theofficialtitleisstillunknown).The\nhypetraininghasjustbeengoingon\nandon,andeversinceitwasknownthat\nitwouldbeopenworld,beengathering\nspeed.Thedescriptionthatitlookslike\ntheSkyrimversionofZeldadoesseem\ntohavesometruth,andallthebetter.\nHopefullythisgamewillbeableto\nfullyutilisethehardwarethattheWiiU\nhastoofferandincorporatethesecond\nscreeninameaningfulway.\nThisgamewillbeonlyavailable\nonWiiU(kindofobvioussinceit\u2019s\nNintendo),howeveramorespecificdate\nisnotknown.\nnovels is not really the kind stuff you\nwill be getting up to. Therefore at this\ngiven time the only way to experience\nspace and everything beyond is\nthrough your computer.\nHowever, up until just a few years\nago the computing power to galaxies,\nsolar systems and even planets\nwas not really in the hands of the\naverage Joe. Therefore the games that\nallowed you to truly feel like you were\ncruising out in space, in terms of raw\ncomputing power as well as virtual\nreality accessories, weren\u2019t being\ncreated. The dreams just didn\u2019t have\nthe tools to become reality.\nUntil now. The ability to\nprocedurally generate billions of\nplanets, each one of them unique is\none of the key features of the game\nNo Man\u2019s Sky which will be released\nin 2015. However, this isn\u2019t even the\nentire story. In addition to planets,\nsuns, black holes the entire surface of\nthe planet, with oceans, mountains,\nplants and animals will always be\ncreated in your computer. This is\nonly ONE of many games coming out\nin the next few years.\nOthers in the list include Elite:\nDangerous and Star Citizen, both\ngames that were funded on\nKickstarter. In fact, Star Citizen\nmanaged to garner of $60,000,000.\nThat if anything shows that there is\ninterest out there for an immersive,\nalmost infinite universe that you can\nexplore in your own spaceship.\nBoth these games will feature a\npervasive multiplayer galaxy that is\nmuch larger than anything you could\never explore. Furthermore, they focus\non realism so that the orbits of the\nobjects you will fly around will be\nas close to real data as possible. You\nhave the ability to play the game the\nway you want, as a smuggler, pirate\nor trader with hyper realistic game\nmechanics and come the closest to\nliving out your dream of being an\nastronaut.\nWe were all born too early/ too late\nto really have any part in any large\nexplorations. We cannot rediscover\nAmerica or be the first to see things\non Pluto that no one ever has.

Black and White\nGothic offers both of these and more.\nPairing personal artefacts with pieces\nboth polished and in progress, this\nexhibition provides a rare glimpse of\nnot only of the works of a first rate,\nyet little known artist, but also an\nopportunity to examine something of\nboth the process of their creation and\nthe character of their creator. Despite\nthe fact that more than two thirds of\nthe members of the Royal Academy\nhave worked as illustrators in the\npast, this art form has remained\nunfairly neglected. This one room\nshowcase focuses largely on Stewart\u2019s\nillustrations for an edition of Joseph\nSheridan Le Fanu\u2019s 1864 novel Uncle\nSilas; a series of darkly evocative stills\nbrimming with barely contained\nmotion, it is well worth a visit for\nanyone with an interest in the gothic\nor in illustration and its influence on\nmodern cinematography.\nCharles Stewart was born in 1915 on\nthe island of Panay in the Philippines.\nDue to poor health and questionable\nlogic on the part of his parents, he\nwas shipped off to the \u2018restorative\u2019\nclimes of Scotland as an infant. The\ninfluence of Shambellie House,\nthe family\u2019s baronial estate near\nDumfries is unmistakable throughout\nhis work. A turreted, gothic house\n\u201clit by oil lamps and candles\u2026 [that]\nto a small child\u2026 seemed a giant\u2019s\ncastle\u2026 [in which] ghosts were\nlargely taken for granted by the\ninhabitants\u201d, Stewart\u2019s formative\nyears were heavily influenced by his\nphysical environment. A series of\nbeautiful, though haunted landscapes\nprovided a dark frame for his\ndeveloping artistic vision. As an air\nraid warden in London during World\nWar II Stewart endured a world of\nterror and darkness on a day-to-day basis. These experiences lend\nhis work a power that elevates his\nillustrations from purely decorative\naddenda to the novel\u2019s text into the\nrealm of independently gripping\nworks as atmospheric as any of the\naccompanying prose.\nDescribed by a colleague as a\n\u201cneat, rounded man with a gentle\npink face and snow white hair\u201d\nwho was often to be spotted dressed\nin tweeds lunching at the Royal\nOverseas League in nearby St\nJames\u2019, he approached his work in\na scholarly fashion. Meticulous\nresearch of Victorian costume\nand artwork was integrated with\na lifelong appreciation of both\nBlack and White Gothic \u2014 Redemption through Darkness\nWilliam Gewanter explores the importance of Charles Stewart\u2019s works\nCharles Stewart, The figure of Uncle Silas rose up, with a death like scowl.\nImage: Royal Academy of Arts\nCharles Stewart, Uncle Silas: Frontispiece, 1947. Image: Royal Academy of\nArts\ncinema and the stage. A number\nof visits to the set of a 1947 film\nproduction of Uncle Silas were to\nbe highly influential upon Stewart\u2019s\nwork, as his illustrations in turn\ninfluenced the cinematographers.\nThe artist\u2019s profound understanding\nof movement on stage and its\ndepiction in still art stems from his\nballetic training, undertaken while\nsimultaneously studying at the Byam\nShaw School of Drawing and Painting\nin the 1930s. Learning quickly,\nStewart went on to perform with\nthe corps de ballet at Covent Garden\nduring the 1936-37 season under the\ndirection of Sir Thomas Beecham. It\nis clear that he was in a particularly\nadvantageous position to marry still\nart with that of the theatre. This\nnaturally led him into the company\nof cinematographers, especially those\nwho shared his passion for tales of\ngothic horror. This is reflected in the\nwide range of media on display in\nthe exhibition, ranging from a scene\nfrom the 1947 film, through many\nof Stewart\u2019s original drawings to a\n1953 watercolour of a larch tree in\nthe grounds of Shambellie. The tree\nimmortalised in an instant, darkly\nsilhouetted against a bright winter\nsky. Stewart feared in later life that\nan increasingly competitive world\nwould induce the corralling of young\npeople\u2019s interests into an overly\nnarrow focus in order to drive up\nacademic or professional standards.\nThe frontispiece for Uncle Silas\n(1947) is convincing argument against\nany such a shift in educational\npractice. Whirling figures straining\nwith movement speak volumes of\nthe influence of his balletic training,\nsomething he suspected that he would\nnot have been able to pursue had he\nbeen born today into a more limiting\nenvironment.\nToday, many find themselves\nalienated from fine art by the\nperception of the culture that\nsurrounds its appreciation. The\nstream of seemingly randomly\nassigned symbolic meanings and\ninterpretations that bear little, if any\nresemblance to the works on display\nleaves many cold to the prospect of\ngiving galleries a chance. I would\nlike to think that Stewart would have\nsympathised with this position. The\nindifference of most art critics was\nsomething he faced throughout his\ncareer and was something that seems\nto have left him largely unmoved.\nGothic art at its best speaks to us on\na visceral level, evoking the creeping\nsensation present at the back of every\nmind that all is not as it seems. Much\nof his work is simple, but rather\nthan a weakness this represents its\ngreatest strength being indicative\nof the universality and importance\nof the themes he explores. There\nare few works of art that manage to\nengage with humanity\u2019s universal\nterror at its inescapable mortality\nwhile concluding on a fundamentally\ninvigorating note. The fact that\nStewart has achieved this is as\nimpressive as it is important. In 1976\nStewart gave Shambellie House to\nthe government, which was soon\nreopened as the National Museum of\nCostume. In 2013 it was announced\nthat the museum was to close despite\nintense local opposition due to\nfinancial pressures.\nThe underlying message of\nStewart\u2019s work is simply too\nimportant to be allowed to similarly\nfade into oblivion. At times we are all\nof us beset by horrors, but more often\nthan not the key to our salvation\nlies in finding the strength within\nourselves to slay our demons, once\nand for all.\nBlack and White Gothic runs until\n15th\nFebruary 2015.

It turns out that the\nLondoner\u2019s assumption of \u201coh, they\u2019ll\nprobably take card\u201d does not extend\nto ushers on doors at theatres \u2013 and\nalso that I get disoriented very easily\nin circular buildings. Nevertheless,\nglossy purple programme in sweaty\nhand, we made our way to the Grand\nCircle.\nKooza last played at the RAH in\n2013, as part of its continuing world\ntour. It is the 20th show that Cirque\nhas produced, and is described by\nGuy Lalibert\u00e9, one of the company\u2019s\nfounders, as \u201cthe return ... to the\nroots of Cirque du Soleil\u201d. David\nShiner, the director, describes it as \u201ca\nshow ... devoted to the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the\nclown\u201d.\nAs such, the show contains all of\nthe circus staples: high wire, swinging\ntrapeze, unicycles and people\nstanding on other people (standing\non a third person). It also features\nno less than three clowns, and a full\nbody puppet dog that caused no end\nof laughter from the various school\ngroups in attendance.\nThe storyline follows a central\ncharacter, Innocent, as he discovers\nthe mysterious world of Kooza.\nPlayed by St\u00e9phan Landry, he is led\ninto a mysterious world of acrobats\nand wonder, controlled by the\nmysterious Trickster. In the second\nact, entrusted with the power to\ncontrol the world, he discovers a\nmore sinister and unsettling world\naltogether. But there is beauty here\ntoo, and during the second act, he is\nappointed King of the realm by one\nof the clowns.\nLandry gives an excellent\nperformance, and acts as the\naudience\u2019s perspective on the show.\nHis status as a clear Mary Sue is a\ndevice also used in Cirque\u2019s feature\nlength retrospective, Worlds Away,\nbut it is not tired here.\nThe three clowns pervade the\nperformance, and are in general\nvery loud and slightly irritating:\na quality that good clowns should\naim for. Despite being stymied by\na sound operator who could have\nbeen watching far more closely, they\npulled off some excellent audience\ninteraction, especially during the\nsecond half and their dance break\nwith \u2018some guy called Chris\u2019.\nHowever, the standout\nperformance came from Barry\nNathan Lowin as the Trickster, the\nruler and controller of the world\nof Kooza. Effortlessly poised, and\npossessed of an unsettling ability to\nflip upside down without warning,\nhe has been with the production\nsince its inception in 2008. It is\nperhaps reasonable that he\u2019s got\nhis act down flat, but from his\nemergence from a jack in the box\nat the beginning to the ceremonial\nclosing of the curtains in the finale,\nhe is a pleasure to watch.\nLowin also proves himself as a\nperformer in his own right as the\nSkeleton King in the second act.\nIt is rare to find such a talented\ndancer in the circus community,\nand Clarence Ford\u2019s 40s and 50s\ninspired choreography give him the\nchance to show up his compatriots in\nappropriate style.\nKooza, quite sensibly, uses the\ntradition of making sure that the\n\u2018most stupid\u2019 things to do happen at\nthe beginnings and ends of acts. The\nbeginning and end of the show are\nperformed mostly by a single group\nof acrobats \u2013 the Charivari. Threehigh shoulder stands and an early\nman-supported trampoline establish\nthe show as classic circus.\nTo end the first half, we are treated\nto a circus staple \u2013 the high wire act,\nin this case involving 4 acrobats.\nStarting fairly lightly, with some\nfake fencing, runs and skipping(!)\non the high wire, the act culminates\nin one acrobat, standing on a chair,\non a pole, on two more acrobats\nriding bikes. On a high wire. It was\nunfortunate that the apparatus took\nso long to set up, though, and the\nuse of a confetti cannon on various\nsections of the stalls didn\u2019t do much\nto pass the time.\nThe Wheel of Death, the first\nacrobatics of Act 2, also disappointed\nme slightly. Having seen what is\npossible on the apparatus in the\nrecording of Worlds Away \u2013 it\u2019s on\nthe US Netflix, I highly recommend\nhaving a look \u2013 it was a shame not\nto see any somersaults outside of\nthe wheels. The performance, by\nits very nature, also lacked a strong\ncharacter, and unfortunately it felt\nrather too much like an exhibition\nand not enough like a masterclass.\nOther weaker performances were\nthe contortion, unicycle and hoop\nacts. I am increasingly convinced\nthat all hoop artists look almost\nexactly the same, and despite the\ncircus adage of \u201cthose in the first\nfew rows, may get wet\u201d, I do feel that\nmany within the auditorium might\nhave wanted to see the sweat \u2013 or at\nleast the performer\u2019s faces.\nI did, though, highly enjoy the\nswinging trapeze and hand-on-hand\nacts \u2013 and not just because they\u2019re\nstyles I love to watch in any forum.\nThe acts were seamless, and the\nemotional love story in the hand-on-hand was truly excellent.\nThe Charivari return at the end to\nperform a teeterboard act. For those\nof you who don\u2019t know, this consists\n\"The range\nof acts is\nhuge, and\nthere is\nsomething\nfor\neveryone\"\n\"It is rare to\nfind such\na talented\ndancer in\nthe circus\ncommunity\"\nof something that looks very like a\nchildren\u2019s see-saw. An acrobat places\nthemselves at one end, and then\ntwo to four more jump on to the\nother end. The flyer is catapulted\n5-6 metres into the air, and flips\noccur. Occasionally the acrobat being\nthrown starts on one or two stilts.\nOne of my favourite aspects\nof the production was in the\nnon-traditional treatment of the\nringmaster. The show is started\nby one of the clowns, a ridiculous\ncreature, before being superseded\nby the enigmatic Trickster. In a rare\ntwist however, Innocent makes most\nof the decisions in the second half;\nindeed, by the finale the show is\nplaced firmly into the hands of the\naudience.\nThe range of acts is huge, and there\nis something for everyone in the\nshow, completing Shiner\u2019s aims of\n\u201c[revealing] the interior life af the\nclown\u2026 his hope, innocence, fear,\nsolitude, joy, and above all his love\u201d.\nKooza is emphatically a Western\nproduction. Despite visually\nengrossing costumes and set,\nimplementing Indian and Eastern\nEuropean influences, the style,\ncharacter, and indeed language\nare agressively North American\n\u2013 specifically, Canadian. It leaves\nbehind abstraction to return to the\nfun-loving circus of Cirque\u2019s early\ndays, and is well worth the price of a\nticket.\nChinese Chair at Cirque du Soleil's Kooza Photo: Owen Carey\n\n"

The Moon Stage is the main\nstage, catering for arguably-bigger\nnames including Above & Beyond\nand Steve Aoki on the Friday, and\nMartin Garrix and Skrillex on the\nSaturday. But my focus at the festival\nwas the smaller Star Stage, which\nhosted the likes of Loco Dice and\nRichie Hawtin on the Friday, and\nMaya Jane Coles and Nina Kraviz\non the Saturday. During the festival\nthere was the typical snobbery found\namong the dance music crowd, with\nsome at the Star Stage disregarding\nthe Moon Stage \u2013 as one reveller put\nit \u2013 as \u201ccommercial shit that\u2019s ruining\ndance music culture\u201d. A far cry from\nthe \u2018one tribe\u2019 idea put forward by the\nfestival\u2019s promoters.\nAnyway, I can confirm that the\nVIP areas at both stages were full to\nthe brim with barely-dressed girls\nand peacocking meatheads more\ninterested in scoring than enjoying\nthe music, so both sides certainly\nhave their vices. I personally view the\nMoon Stage as a great introduction\nfor those previously unacquainted\nwith the dance music world: a gateway\ndrug to darker sounds, if you will.\nThroughout the weekend many made\nthe trek to the Star Stage, with most\nof them mesmerised by unfamiliar\nsounds, a trend towards musical\ndiscovery that\u2019ll no doubt continue\nin the festival\u2019s wake. And surely\nopening people\u2019s eyes to new sounds\ncan only be a good thing. That said,\nI\u2019d much rather have Richie Hawtin\nsmash a speaker in my face than get\ncaked by Steve Aoki.\nThe festival went in hard on the\nFriday night, as party goers waved\ngoodbye to the working week and\nput on their dancing shoes. After a\ncouple of striking opening sets that\ngot everyone in the mood, Detroit\u2019s\nMagda hit the decks to pick up\nthe pace with some rich industrial\nvibes, which segued into Loco Dice\u2019s\nestablished brand of groovy bass,\nbefore Richie Hawtin closed the\nevening with a hefty dose \u2013 he had the\nlongest set across both stages and days\n\u2013 of dark minimal techno. Saturday\nnight was equally strong, with rising\nstar Mano Le Tough and veteran\nDamian Lazarus delivering quality\nperformances, setting the scene for\na delicious deep set from Maya Jane\nColes that coincided with beautiful\nfireworks over the water behind\nboth stages. Next, Grammy-winning\nDubfire spun a seamless funky set\nbefore stepping down to make way\nfor techno goddess Nina Kraviz, who\nabsolutely killed it as always.\nI was particularly interested in\nthe presence of home-grown talent,\nof which the Star Stage at ZoukOut\noffered plenty, both behind the decks\nand grooving on the sand. Red Bull\nhave spotted the potential in Debbie\nChia, while Zouk resident Jeremy\nBoon has already made it as far as\nAmsterdam Dance Event. A special\nshout-out also goes to Hong: Kraviz\nis undoubtedly a tough act to follow,\nespecially at 7 o\u2019clock in the morning,\nbut he managed to creatively\nprevent a mass exodus by spinning\nthe latest Caribou effort \u2018Can\u2019t Do\nWithout You\u2019, which kept revellers\nglued for the final hour. It could be\nthe mixing skills, sure, but this was\nobviously aided by dropping this\nbelter from Imperial\u2019s most beloved\nmusical alumnus (sorry Brian May).\nIt was also refreshing to see a solid\nrepresentation of Singaporeans in the\ncrowd, proof of the unabating power\nof the internet to deliver fresh beats\nto anyone interested, irrespective of\ngeographical location.\nYou might think that Singapore\u2019s\nharsh drug laws would be a double-edged sword, and you\u2019d be wrong.\nThe logic of drug advocates usually\ngoes that alcohol brings out the worst\nin disgruntled young men and ruins\nthe vibe of the party, although my\nexperience at ZoukOut and recent\nreading of Mark Easton\u2019s Britain\nEtc. would lead me to believe that\nthis is probably just a British (or,\nat best, European) phenomenon.\nWhile it would be difficult to\nseparate narcotics from western club\nculture, there was a distinct absence\nat Singapore, which was extremely\nrefreshing to see. Rather than\nlooking around to spot young minds\nlosing their shit to pretty much\nanything blasting out of the speakers,\nSingapore\u2019s sober crowd required a\ncertain level of finesse in order to\nbe entertained. There were no fights\nbreaking out or casualties arising\nfrom tainted batches of pills, just a\nbunch of young people there for a\ngood time. This adds a huge degree of\ncredibility to a subculture that for too\nlong has been tarnished by stimulant\nuse; for this I believe ZoukOut is\nworthy of some bonus points.\nAll in all, ZoukOut was executed\nwith perfect precision. The organisers\ndid a fantastic job on every front,\nincluding free transport to and\nfrom the venue, reasonably-priced\n(by Singapore standards) food and\ndrinks, and a blinding array of\nfireworks. But, most importantly,\nthe artists were at the top of their\ngame; every set was flawless and\nbrought unique magic to the dance\nfloor, projected far and wide by the\nepic sound systems. Whether you\u2019re\ninterning, travelling, or heading\nhome for the holidays, be sure to\nhave ZoukOut on your cards for next\nyear.\nThey don't have palm trees at Glastonbury.

Unlike\nthe stereotypical loud, busy and\nsomewhat overwhelming African art,\nTokoudagba draws from influences\nother than the continent\u2019s rapid\nurbanisation and explores aspects of\nthe region\u2019s rich cultural and spiritual\nhistory. Harking from Benin, the\nhome of Vodun (voodoo) and the\npowerful Kingdom of Dahomey, the\nsculptor and painter established his\ncareer as a restorer of traditional\nroyal palaces and temples and hence\nhad unprecedented access to the\ndying traditions of the Fon people.\nCreating surreal works steeped in\nVodun symbolism, his works leave\nyou with a sense of unease, haunting,\nas if left in a trance by the creatures\nsuspended on the cream background.\nHis works paint a different picture of\nAfrica, one of its too often overlooked\nhistory, as opposed to its perceived\npresent of corruption, war and\nfamine.\nUnlike Tokoudagba, the young\nIvorian artist Aboudia forces Africa\nto confront its dark present. Taking\nthe stylised image of the mask, he\nadds violence to it with his harsh\nbrushstrokes, ripping apart this\nromanticised symbol of African\npride. He shows that the world\nthat is represented through these\nmasks no longer exists, replaced\nby a cruel world of death, violence\nand destruction. With his heavily\noverlaid collages, he creates conflict\nand confusion, dark colours and\nskeletal figures draped in AK-47\u2019s. He\nprovides a rare critique, a rare protest\namongst artists who force themselves\nto be positive whilst ignoring Africa\u2019s\nugliness. These two artists are nothing\nlike what you would expect from\nAfrican Art.\nMuch like the internationally\nrenowned human-rights lawyer and\nactivist Amal Ramzi Alamuddin is\nnow forever known as \u2018Mrs Clooney\u2019,\nCamille Claudel has gone down in\nhistory as \u2018Rodin\u2019s lover\u2019. The truth is\nso much more interesting than that;\na French sculptor and artist, Claudel\n\u2013 barred from attending the \u00c9cole des\nBeaux-Arts due to her gender \u2013 took\nit upon herself to learn her craft,\nstudying under Alfred Boucher, and\nrenting a workshop with other young\nfemale artists. Her work is dramatic,\nheroic, romantic, and tragic. What\nlittle of her work survives today\nreveals a true artistic talent, whose\nability to transfigure a block of onyx\ninto a living sculpture is nothing\nshort of astonishing. In 1913, at the\nrequest of her brother, Claudel was\nThere\u2019s More to Art than White Western Males\nFred Fyles and Kamil McClelland give five overlooked artists that you should know about\nadmitted to an insane asylum; she\nnever left, dying there in 1943. Her\nremains were buried in a communal\ngrave, am insult to her legacy and\ntalent.\nA lot of art is about empowerment,\nabout representation. It is this\nthat makes the work of Zanele\nMuholi so important. A South\nAfrican photographer who mixes\nin activism with her work, Muholi\ndocuments the lives of innumerable\nSouth African lesbians who live in\nfear of corrective rape, assault, and\nmurder. Mapping the identity of\nher community, Muholi documents\nan unsteady course through post-apartheid South Africa, a country in\nwhich equal marriage is enshrined\nin the constitution, but the LGBTQ\ncommunity is constantly under\nthreat. Although active for more than\na decade, her work is still highlighting\nthis tragedy that is often ignored by\nthe Western media.\nOk, so Anni Albers may not be an\n\u2018unknown artist\u2019 \u2013 her Wikipedia\npage describes her as the best\nknown textile artist of the 20th\ncentury \u2013 but her medium is grossly\nunderappreciated in an art world\nthat tends to be hostile to anything\ndeemed \u2018decorative\u2019 or \u2018trivial\u2019\n(never mind the fact that such fields\ntend to be those in which women\nare most prominent). Studying\nat the Bauhaus during its golden\nera under Walter Gropius, Albers\nimmediately displayed a strong skill\nwith textile work, particularly her\neye for repeating geometric patterns.\nMarrying fellow artist Josef Albers,\nthe pair fled to North Carolina in\n1933 to escape the Nazis \u2013 once there\nshe began to teach at art schools,\nand published numerous articles\non modern design. Passing away in\n1994, at the age of 94, Albers has\nleft a legacy in textile design that\nis unmatched by any other artist;\nher striking patterns, which take in\nRussian constructivism, German\nmodernism, and pre-Columbian\nartistry, are ground-breaking in their\nfreshness, looking just as new as the\nday they were woven.\nClockwise from top left: Untitled by Cyprien Tokoudagba; Detail from Spiritual Conversations by Aboudia; Bongiwe Twana Kunene by Zanele Muholi;\nStudy Rug by Anni Albers; Waltz by Camille Claudel\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 15\nFELIX 23.01.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week, The Times reported that\nThe Sun had dropped their Page 3\nfeature. Following the writing of this\narticle, the naked ladies were reinstated\non Thursday.\nThe Sun dropped its Page 3\nfeature this week, ending a\n40 year tradition of featuring\nyoung, beautiful women on their\nthird page, mostly topless and\nwith suggestive headers or sidebars\nwith \u201cThe News in Briefs\u201d. The\nchange comes following a 28 month\ncampaign by No More Page 3, lead\nby Lucy-Anne Holmes. The No More\nPage 3 website states, \u201cThis is not\nabout censorship, or passing an Act of\nParliament to force Dominic Mohan,\nthe editor of The Sun, to scrap Page\nThree. We are asking him \u2013 politely \u2013\nto remove it voluntarily.\u201d\nThis week they succeeded in their\naim, but the response hasn\u2019t been\ntotally supportive. Some women\nhave accused the movement of being\nanti-sex-worker, of being prudish,\nand of opposing the free press. Past\ncampaigns to remove the pictures\nhave led to women being branded\n\u201cfat and jealous\u201d, and as \u201cbattleaxe(s)\u201d\nby the newspaper itself, which\nhas maintained silence over the\nsurprising decision not to feature the\npictures since last Friday. Why the\nfeature was removed from print is\nstill a mystery, but since new topless\nphotos are available on the Sun\nwebsite daily, something tells me it\nwasn\u2019t a sudden feminist epiphany.\nPersonally, I think the removal of\nPage 3 is just a small step towards a\nfairer representation of women in\nthe media. Whilst I am in favour\nof the freedom of women to utilise\ntheir bodies in any way they would\nlike without reproach, from glamour\nmodelling to serving in the army, I\nbelieve that while the British media\ncontinue to underrepresent the words\nand actions of women in the news,\nand focus instead on looks and boobs,\nthey are still upholding sexism and\ninequality in our society.\nIn a 2012 study on women in\njournalism, it was found that 84% of\npeople mentioned or quoted in front\npage articles were men. Only 24% of\njournalists at daily newspapers are\nwomen and male experts who were\nquoted or interviewed in science\npieces outnumbered women 4 to 1.\nWomen will have fewer mentions in\npolitical and scientific news, because\nof the dearth of women in these\nfields, but the refusal of national news\nto acknowledge the opinions and\nactions of half the population leads in\nturn to the view that women do not\nbelong in these spheres.\nNo More Page 3 has got into trouble\nwith some critics due to members\nof the campaign shaming the Page\n3 models, and extending this shame\nto all female sex workers. It is this\nside of the campaign which lead\nmany members of Imperial Feminist\nSociety, including myself, to decide\nagainst supporting the campaign,\nbecause we believe that sex workers\ndeserve the same respect as any\nwomen, and that the Page 3 models\nare not the people acting in ways that\nwe should be campaigning against.\nPage 3 in isolation would be mere\nPage 3 has been a long-running feature in The Sun, used to front many\ncampaigns such as breast cancer awareness. Photo: The Independent\nELIZABETH CAMPBELL\nCOMMENT WRITER\ntitillation, but with the backdrop of\nthe continuing absence of women\u2019s\nvoices in British news it takes on a\nmore serious role.\nIf we can work towards a more\nequal media representation then by\nall means plaster erogenous zones (of\nall genders!) all over your tabloids.\nUntil then Page 3, scantily clad celebs\nin \u201ccandid\u201d photographs and the lack\nof women\u2019s voices in the daily news\nall simply seek to reinforce the idea\nthat women have no more to offer\nthan their looks, and that is what we\nshould really be campaigning against.\nThis goes out to all the bad\npeople. This is for the\nterrorists and the murderers;\nfor those who are violent and\nbigoted, or ignorant and entitled;\nfor the unscrupulous businessmen\nand the hypocritical prigs; for the\nunrepentant criminals and the self-righteous moralisers. To you, I want\nto say thank you.\nYou bad people make my life\nso much easier. You see, I\u2019m not a\ngood person by any stretch of the\nimagination. I\u2019m lazy, self-centred,\npretty arrogant and spoiled. I\u2019ve been\nknown to not recycle, and I demand\nof others more than I ask of myself.\nI\u2019ve never volunteered, I barely ever\ndonate to charity, I struggle to eat my\nfive-a-day and I once killed a puppy.\nI lie a lot and spend too much time\nplaying video games. But, I\u2019m not a\nbad person. Not while people who are\nworse than me exist.\nIt\u2019s really, really easy to destroy any\nfeeling of self-improvement when I\ncompare myself to you, bad people.\nI may not spare two thoughts for\nimpoverished girls in Africa, but at\nleast I didn\u2019t kidnap them and force\nthem to marry me. I may have vague\nand ill-informed opinions about\nsociety and gender roles, but I have\nnever harassed someone over the\ninternet in the name of abolishing\nthe patriarchy or defending ethics in\ngame journalism.\nWhen I look at my failures and\nmy faults, they all seem small and\ninsignificant when measured against\nthe enormities that other people\ncommit. It becomes clear to me that\neven if I did try to improve myself,\nI\u2019m still better than many others\nthrough inaction. By simply minding\nmy business, I do not harm other\npeople, which is more than can be said\nfor those who are bad. Sure, I don\u2019t\nhelp other people either, but indolent\npassivity seems like an acceptable\nsecond to being a good person.\nBesides, the modern age has made\nPIETRO ARONICA\nCOMMENT WRITER\nit all the easier to be good. Donating\nto most charities takes a few clicks\nat most, and simply hashtagging the\nbuzzword of the week shows that I\ncare. If I\u2019m feeling extra-helpful, I\ncould even change my profile pic on\nFacebook to something like \u2018Je suis\nCharlie\u2019 or whatever will be the next\ncatchphrase in order to \u201cincrease\nawareness\u201d and \u201cshow solidarity\u201d.\nI mean, I haven\u2019t done any of those\nthings, but it\u2019s good to know that\nthere\u2019s always the option in case I\nneed it.\nIn a better society, I would be a bad\nperson. I would feel forced to improve\nmyself, to sacrifice something to\nhelp others, to stop wasting time and\nmoney for selfish reasons, to try to be\nsomething more than I am right now.\nBut that would take effort. So I\u2019m\nglad I live in this society, where I can\njustify my flaws by saying, \u2018at least\nI\u2019m not as bad as those guys\u2019.\nAnd for this, I have to thank you,\nbad people.\nShould we celebrate the\nloss of Page 3?\nI want to say thank you to the bad people\nMaybe it isn\u2019t good to compare myself to them, but I do\n\"I\u2019ve never\nvolunteered,\nI barely ever\ndonate to\ncharity, I\nstruggle to\neat my five-a-day and I\nonce killed a\npuppy.\"\n\"I\u2019m glad I\nlive in this\nsociety,\nwhere I can\njustify my\nflaws...\"\n\n"

So what is all the commotion\nabout?\nThe play tells the story of Martha\n(Juma Sharkah), a fresh-faced\nfourteen-year-old girl on the cusp of\nwomanhood, who lives in a village\nwith her grandmother, Mamie\nEsther (Cecilia Noble). When rebels\nattack, the two head for Monrovia to\nfind refuge with a relative, Martha\ndisguised as a boy so as to not distract\nthe gaze of the coked-up soldiers.\nBut when they are separated at a\ncheckpoint, Martha finds herself\npropelled into the surreal world of the\n\u2018Small Boys Unit\u2019, stuck in her false\nidentity as a man. From then on, you\nwatch as Martha, now named Frisky,\nloses her childhood and becomes\nnumb to what she experiences, a sad\nreflection of the other children in the\nunit, now hardened, who must have\ngone through the same traumatizing\nprocess. Whilst at the start you\nfelt fear towards these soldiers,\nconfronting you and shouting you,\njust under the skin lies a child,\nterrified of the situation they find\nthemselves in.\nThis insight into the Liberian Civil\nWar and the perverse press-ganging\nof child soldiers certainly did leave\nan impact on me. Set designer Anna\nFleischle wanted to create a space that\n\u201cphysically infringes on you, as if you\nare somehow complicit\u201d and, as you\nare herded around the space, at one\npoint split into males and females,\nyou cannot help but feel privy to what\nwas happening, totally immersed in\nthis horrifying world. Shockingly\nimmediate, you are verbally\nconfronted by the child soldiers but\nare powerless to intervene in the rape\nand murder on the red earth in front\nof you.\nFrom 1989 to 1996, a civil war that\npitted Charles Taylor against rival\nPrince Johnson ravaged Liberia,\nleaving 200,000 dead and millions\ndisplaced. But what particularly\nstood out about this conflict was the\nrecruitment of children into \u2018Small\nBoys Units\u2019, separated from their\nfamilies and forced to fight in a\nworld of rape, death and destruction.\nAlthough Atuona doesn\u2019t particularly\ndwell on the circumstance of the war,\nwe are given insight into its terror\nthrough the story of these children,\nrobbed of their childhood but\nyearning for a father figure in their\nleader Taylor, whom they call \u2018Papay\u2019.\nBut because of this, the story becomes\nless about the particular historical\ncontext but more one of the way\nwarfare distorts of childhood, one\nthat could be applied to any conflict\naround the world.\nThis play represents Sharkah\u2019s\nprofessional stage debut, impressive\nseeing the quality of her acting\nand that of the rest of the cast,\nespecially the younger members,\nsuch as Weruche Opia (Finda) and\nMichael Ajao (Double Trouble). Her\nstony fa\u00e7ade as Frisky as she slowly\nbecomes incorporated into the unit\ndoes not stop her true inner self,\ndelicate and caring, to shine through,\nespecially in her relationship abused\nand imprisoned Finda. I only wish\nthere was more in-depth analysis of\nthe psyche of children in warfare,\nmore quiet moments between the\ngun-wielding bravado to explore the\nbackground of these children, their\nmentality and how they yearn for\nnormalcy.\nBut the work did get most other\nthings right, helping you understand\nthat the world of drugs, violence and\nmisogyny was not the fault of these\nignorant, lost children, but the work\nof the adults who manipulated them\ninto committing atrocities through\nthe promise of a father figure and\nsome kind of stability.\nIt really was an excellent play. You\nfelt affronted by the intimacy and\nviolence yet you could empathise\nwith the perpetrators, knowing,\nthrough the story of Martha, that it\nis not their fault but out of necessity\nthat they act this way. And whilst the\nproduction might not be everyone\u2019s\ncup of tea, I think it does an excellent\njob in demystifying this world\nthat superficially seems utterly\nunbelievable to outsiders.\nLiberian Girl is on until the 31st\nJanuary, at the Royal Court.

Mitchell was also keen to\nemphasise the benefits that foreign\naid spending can bring to the UK:\nhelping British business and reducing\nthe risk of conflict and terrorism.\nTurning to his record in\ngovernment, Mitchell said he is\nproud of pushing through the Bribery\nact that prevents companies engaging\nin corrupt practices abroad that they\nwould never consider doing in the\nUK.\nHe was also keen to stress the\ndecisions made at DfID to ensure\nefficiencies and value for money\nfor the taxpayer, often, for instance,\npaying charities and NGOs to carry\nout operations, rather than using an\nalready overstretched military.\nMitchell also defended the UK\u2019s\nhistoric aid to India. Although\nthis funding is now being wound\ndown, the government has been\ncriticised for still providing aid to a\ncountry, which now has its own space\nprogramme.\nIn response, he pointed out the\nlevels of poverty that still exist there,\nand that the space programme is\nprivately funded, and will aid India\u2019s\ndevelopment through improved\ncommunications across the vast\ncountry.\nMitchell was also keen to\nencourage students to get involved\nin international development, and\noffered advice to those considering a\ncareer in the sector.\nWhen asked how he would respond\nto those critical of funding projects\noverseas in a time of difficulties in\nthe UK, he replied: \u201ccharity begins at\nhome, but it doesn\u2019t end there.\u201d\nMr Mitchell has had a varied\ncareer including spells as an army\nofficer and an investment banker\nbefore first entering parliament in\n1987, before eventually rising to the\nposition of Conservative chief whip.\nRAG chair Ben Fernando said:\n\u201dI'm really glad Mr Mitchell could\ncome along and engage in a really\ninteresting discussion with us about\nInternational Development.\nIt was also good to see how many\npassionate people there are at\nImperial on this subject.\u201d\nAndrew Mitchell,\nMP, speaks at\nImperial\nJAMES BEZER\nNEWS REPORTER\nAnother broken coach\nwindow and a suspension\nfor the ICSM Boat Club\nAnother sports club tour has\nresulted in a broken coach\nwindow, with the club now\ncurrently suspended as a result.\nThe incident happened on the\nmixed Medics Boat Club tour to\nLeuven, Belgium, last weekend, as\nthe coach was waiting at Dover to\nboard the ferry. The coach was not\nin motion, and as we understand no\nstudents were hurt.\nThe low quality CCTV shows a\nmember of the party falling against\na window, and they either broke the\nwindow as they fell or they may have\nused an emergency hammer. It is\nbelieved that the person responsible\nis a qualified doctor.\nFelix understands that the coach\nalso required valeting as, allegedly, 25\nbottles of port were recovered from\nthe floor of the vehicle, eight seats\nwere covered with vomit and three\ncondoms were found down the side of\nsome of the seats.\nSources also have said that during\nthe journey many students were\nout of their seats, which may have\nincreased the risk of a student falling\nagainst a window in the first place.\nFelix has also been told that the\ntotal damages amount to \u00a33,075,\nwhich the company are currently\npursuing through Imperial College\nUnion. This includes the cost to\nrepair the window, valet the coaches\nand also the loss of earnings after\nhaving to take the coaches off the\nroad to be cleaned properly.\nThe club were suspended on\nMonday (yesterday), and were told\nin a club email that they are banned\nfrom any sort of training and\nsocial activities until \u201cthey are told\notherwise.\u201d They have been advised\nto not wear any kit with their logos or\nbranding on them, and refrain from\nposting on social media in regards\nto the tour. They have also been told\nnot to \u201cdiscuss what happened with\nanyone not involved.\u201d\nAnother email, sent to the mailing\nlist shortly after, advised students not\nto attend a suggested party after the\ntour, and also thanked students who\nhelped to clean up the coaches after\nthe journey.\nThis year\u2019s tour to Leuven, Belgium,\nknown as the 10+1 Tour since it is now\nin its eleventh year, was organised last\nterm, and both students and doctors\nwho had recently graduated were in\nattendance. The tour consisted of 100\nstudents, spread across two coaches,\nand each coach ticket cost \u00a355 per\nstudent, with the club paying \u00a35,250\nin total to book the coaches and the\nferry trip.\nThe students left Hammersmith at\n11pm Friday night en route to Dover\nto catch a ferry. However the coach\ncompany had to send another vehicle\nto Dover at about 2am to take the\nstranded students to Leuven, after\ntheir previous vehicle was rendered\nunsafe due to the broken window.\nThey arrived in Leuven around\n1pm on Saturday, remained\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\novernight in a hotel then returned\nSunday evening. The coach arrived\nback in Hammersmith at 9.15 pm.\nThe coach company had previously\ntold the students it was permitted to\ndrink on the vehicle.\nTom Wheeler, Imperial College\nUnion President, when asked for a\nstatement on the matter, told Felix:\n\u201cDuring a 48-hour Medics Boat Club\nTour to Belgium, damage was caused\nto the rear window of a Coach. The\ndamage was caused by an alumnus\nof the College. It is believed that the\nwindow became damaged following\ncontact with the member\u2019s body. The\nClub has been suspended pending a\nUnion investigation.\u201d\nDariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli, the\nPresident of Imperial College School\nof Medicine, told Felix: \u201cThe incident\nthat occurred recently is not being\ntaken lightly by ICSMSU. We are\ncurrently investigating the incident\nin order to get a full picture. ICSMSU\nBoat have been co-operating fully\nsince the incident was reported.\u201d\nThe club declined to comment on\nthe incident.\nThis comes only months after\nthe Imperial Medicals Rugby team\nsmashed a coach window last term\nwhilst on tour too, that time to\nBristol. The team was also suspended\nas a result.\nNOTE: This article has been edited\nfrom the original online version to add\nin Dariush\u2019s statement on the matter,\nand redact any direct quotes made by the\ncoach company on their request.\nPhoto: ICSM Boat Club\n\n"

Two\npeople leave. Anyone who is\nfamiliar with the BBC show\nThe Apprentice, in which a collection\nof terminally unlikable corporate\ndrones are paraded in front of the\ncamera, will be familiar with this\nformat; every week a contestant is\nsent packing, the grizzly tones of Sir\nAlan\u2019s catchphrase \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d still\nringing in their ears. In the Young\nVic\u2019s latest production Bull, this\nformat is brought to the stage, and we\nare presented with a similar dilemma.\nWith the recession causing their\ncompany to downsize, three office\nworkers must compete for the two\njobs that will remain after (in business\njargon-speak) the \u2018restructuring\u2019.\nOver the course of a mere 55 minutes,\nwe watch as simple power plays \u2013\n\u2018Why aren\u2019t you wearing your nice\nsuit?\u2019 \u2013 turn to something much more\nsinister, with two corporate sharks\nripping apart their limp colleague.\nSam Troughton plays Thomas, the\nunfortunate pawn in this game of\nsocial Darwinism; with his receding\nhairline, wire-frame glasses, and\nslightly-too-tight shirt that does\nlittle to hide a developing paunch,\nThomas is a difficult character to\nlike, let alone sympathise with.\nSweating under the stage lights like\na televised Richard Nixon, Thomas\nis like a deer in the headlights before\nhis colleagues: the stereotypical\nhigh-flying ice-queen Isobel (Eleanor\nMatsuura) and the horrifically \u2018alpha\u2019\nTony (Adam James), described as a\nperson who \u201cruns marathons to sleep\nwith the charity workers\u201d.\nSlowly and surely, subtle digs and\nmisinformation turn into something\nmuch darker, with a clear conspiracy\nemerging between Tony and Isobel;\nThomas can only watch as any\nchance he had of remaining in the\njob slips away from him (this isn\u2019t\na spoiler \u2013 the game is fixed from\nthe very beginning). Troughton\nplays the part with aplomb, his\ndesperation eventually spilling over\ninto sheer physicality as he charges\naround the stage. However, while\nhis performance is simultaneously\nheart-breaking and revolting, there\nare moments where the dialogue feels\nslightly stilted; in some parts of the\nplay, what should be lightning-quick\nwitticisms are delivered somewhat\nlaconically, disrupting the tensions.\nThat being said, as individuals,\nall the actors are fantastic; even\nNeil Stuke, whose role as the CEO\namounts to little more than a cameo,\nmanages to imbue his short time\non stage with a sense of sadistic\npower. Special mention, however,\nmust go to Matsuura, who inhibits\nher character with a cold, clear-cut sensibility; quite the opposite\nof Troughton\u2019s bumbling stature,\nshe manages to maintain a ramrod\nposture throughout the performance,\nheightening her frigid physicality.\nIt is also Matsuura who delivers the\nstunning closing monologue, giving\na bravura performance in which she\nremorselessly shreds any dignity that\nThomas was clutching onto.\nDirector Clare Lizzimore, working\nwith designer Soutra Gilmour, has\nmade the bold choice of presenting\nthe action in a boxing ring; in one\ncorner ominously sits a monolithic\nwater cooler, while the audience\nis divided into tiered spaces, both\nseated and standing. This gives us a\nmuch greater sense of a spectacle, and\nalso makes us somewhat complicit\nin the torturing of Thomas; as\nobservers we are also collaborators,\nespecially when barbarous taunts\nare flung from Isobel and Tony. We\nreally shouldn\u2019t be laughing at such\na pathetic creature as Thomas, but\nMike Bartlett\u2019s witty script makes it\ndifficult to resist.\nUltimately, while Bull is certainly a\nstrong play, held up by a terrific small\ncast, there is a feeling that something\nis missing.\nBefore the play starts, while\nthe audience is assembling,\nloudspeakers blare out Frankie\nGoes To Hollywood\u2019s Two Tribes,\nand Survivor\u2019s Eye of the Tiger,\npsyching up the audience in a way\nthat the play never quite lives up to.\nWhilst watching, I was reminded of\ntwo similar plays, which tackle the\nsame themes: firstly Yasmina Reza\u2019s\nGod of Carnage, in which two sets\nof suburban parents try and settle\na dispute between their sons, but\nend up drunkenly hurling insults\nat each other; and secondly Lucy\nPrebble\u2019s Enron, which exposes those\nresponsible for the Enron scandal of\nthe early-noughties.\nWhilst Reza\u2019s work bristles with a\nslowly mounting tension, Prebble\u2019s\nsacrifices tension and reserve for\nlarger-than-life characters, who\nbecome horrific near-caricatures\nof actual financiers (although, the\nplay is that much more chilling\nbecause even then the characters\nare completely believable). Bull\ntries to do both, oscillating between\na mounting suspense and outr\u00e9\nmoments in which the characters are\nunbelievably revolting. As a result,\nwe never really get a full picture of\nwhat is trying to be done; are things\nsupposed to be tense, or horrifically\ncomic? At one point, a bit of dialogue\nabout sexual abuse gives us hope \u2013 if\nthat is the right word \u2013 that things\nwill take a much darker turn; but\nthen this is simply dropped, and\nnever mentioned again. Rather than\ncharging around in the dark, Bull\nwould surely be better if it had a clear\ntarget and vision that it could aim\nfor. Despite the great cast and the\ninnovative direction, it is difficult\nnot to get the sense that something\nmore could be done with the plot\nto elevate it beyond a simple tale of\noffice politics.\nSam Troughton, Adam James and Eleanor Matsuura Photo: Simon Annand\nNeil Stukew in Bull at the Young Vic Photo: Simon Annand\n\"While Bull\nis certainly\na strong\nplay,\nthere is a\nfeeling that\nsomething\nis missing\"\n\"Oscillating\nbetween\nmounting\nsuspense\nand outr\u00e9\nmoments\"\n\n"

Its location is also\nunique: just off Cable Street,the\nhall is at the junction between the\ncity and the East End,an area that\nhas been dynamically changing for\nyears,and is now rapidly gentrifying.\nWith many original features still\nremaining,Wilton\u2019s Music Hall is a\none-of-a-kind venue,and certainly\nworth checking out for anyone\ninterested in culture,architecture,\nand even the history of the city we\nall live in.\nNext: LaServaPadrona(TheMaidas\nMistress)\n3rd\n-8th\nFebruary\nA Rococo romp through Marylebone\nin the mid-18th Century,this\nproduction should serve as a\nperfect introduction to the world of\ntheatre and opera for those who are\nintimidated by their reputations.\nPerformers bring life and laughter\ninto this magical venue.

As a result, they are kept\naway from their close friends, and\nindeed their friends may have\ngraduated by the time they are well\nenough to resume education, which\nposes an additional difficulty.\nThe truth is that mental illnesses\nare more common than people think,\nespecially in an intense environment\nthat strives for academic excellence,\nwhere competition between peers\ncan be a contributing factor. People\nwith mental illnesses may never fully\nrecover, despite the best medicines\nand talking therapy. Their condition\ncan relapse unexpectedly. Mental\nillnesses are unpredictable, much like\nthe British weather!\nMental illness sufferers are\nvulnerable. They are more likely to\nbecome victims of physical, sexual,\nand drug abuse. The chances of\nthis are further aggravated by an\nunsupportive or unknowing college\ncommunity.\nThe same goes for students whose\nA lot of people have started admitting that they need help after long periods of silence.

People\nwith chronic physical illnesses often\ndevelop mental health problems in\nthe long term.\nIn this New Year, there ought to\nbe actions taken by the student body\nto address this matter of concern.\nMental Health Awareness Week is\nonly the start of a long road ahead.\nImperial College students should\nembrace colleagues with mental\nillnesses and support their study at\nuniversity. It is time to break the\nsilence.\ncapitalise on this.\nThis failure is worth reflecting\non; with the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion, the traditional socialist and\ncommunist parties were decisively\ndiscredited. Subsequently, the\n90s were, following an influential\narticle by political theorist Wendy\nBrown, a period of melancholy for\nthe left, with the most trenchant\nintellectual example probably being\nEric Hobsbawm\u2019s magisterial but\ndeeply pessimistic Age of Extremes.\nIt was probably this collapse more\nthan anything else that allowed \u2013 to\nagain reference Hobsbawm \u2013 the\nneo-revisionism of a \u2018Thatcher in\ntrousers\u2019 to completely bankrupt the\nsocial democracy of the Labour party,\nself-advocated until 1995.\nThis neo-revisionism has deeper\nroots, however; Eduard Bernstein\nwas the leading intellectual light\nIt\u2019s time for action on mental illness\nWhy are university students still so afraid to admit they need help?\nSome brief notes on Labour\nChristy Kelly discusses whether votes for Labour mean social change\nfor the early Labour grandees \u2013 Keir\nHardie and Ramsay MacDonald \u2013\nwhile the Labour party was formed\nin opposition to, or at least as distinct\nfrom, Hyndmann\u2019s Social Democratic\nFederation and William Morris\u2019\nCommunist League. This gave\nLabour a reformist tendency from its\nconception which it has never lost.\nThis reformist instinct pushed\nLabour to the right over the course\nof the 20th\ncentury. The tendency\nwas neither uniform nor total: the\ngrowth of Communist parties \u2013\nimmediately after 1917, just after the\ndepression, just after WWII \u2013 tended\nto act as a countervailing force for\nLabour pushing it left to preserve its\nelectorate, while the great advances\nof revisionism were in the 50s\nunder Gaitskell, due to the success\nof capitalism in the period and cold\nwar tensions, as well as the late 80s\nand 90s, in response to persistent\ndefeats at the hands of a new global\nneoliberal ascendancy originating\nwith Thatcher.\nThe problem with Labour today\nis that it has remained insensitive\nto the ideological currents of recent\nyears. There is much overblown\ntalk of a \u2018return to socialism\u2019 from\nLabour but alas, the most depressing\nmoment of the Labour party\nconference was not the spectacle of an\nincompetent party \u2018leader\u2019 delivering\nan embarrassing speech, but an Ed\nBalls whose economic proposals rang\nout in a Tory register, the occasional\ndissonance \u2013 say, the mansion tax \u2013\nserving only to highlight the essential\nharmony. It is perhaps high time to\nface the fact that Labour is not a party\nof the left, and voting for them serves\nmore to settle our own consciences\nthan help promote social change.\nI\u2019ve never been a good writer, and\nhave never before written for\nFelix. However, I have lately felt\na strong desire to write, as a voice for\nthose who may be suffering in silence.\nThroughout the last couple of\nmonths, and up to the turn of 2015, a\nsmall but highly significant number\nof people I have become acquainted\nwith have revealed that they have\nbeen suffering from mental health\nproblems in one form or another.\nThese shocking stories are often\nrevealed in personalised narratives\nto friends, via Facebook, after a long\nperiod of silence. I daresay those who\nare brave enough to do so represent\nonly a minority.\nWhy does it take people so long\nto tell someone that they need help?\nAnd what about those who have never\ntold anyone? The reason is people are\nscared. People are afraid that they will\nbe judged. People are fearful of being\nlabelled as \u2018mad\u2019 or \u2018not normal\u2019. The\nconsequences and stigma associated\nwith mental illness lead to many\npeople preferring the option to suffer\nin silence. They should not be. After\nall, we all have different personalities.\nOur experiences shape our individual\nselves. Therefore university students\nshould not be afraid to speak out.\nWithout support from college, and\na caring community, however, people\nYIFEI WANG\nCOMMENT WRITER\nImight characterise a typology\nof reactions by us, on the left,\nto the three-main parties in the\nforthcoming election as follows:\nfirstly, repulsed by the Lib Dems\nfor the betrayal of much of their\nelectorate at the last election and\ntheir hypocritical self-righteousness\nin their moral criticism of the Tories,\nwhich tries to cover up their support\nfor the same austerity economics.\nThe Tories are even worse, if that\u2019s\npossible, in their banal nationalism,\ntheir hatred of education and their\noffensive neoliberalism; while the\nincompetence of Labour leaders and\ntheir mild economic reformism can\nonly come as a remarkable let-down\nin the face of a genuine radicalisation\nof the British public over the past few\nyears or so.\nAs a sad aside, I will mention\nhere that the biggest beneficiary\nof this radicalisation has been\nUKIP. UKIP perform the tried and\ntested techniques of all right-wing\npopulisms: a fairly abstract, and thus\noften reasonably accurate, criticism\nof existing political institutions and\nstructures, followed by a short-circuit\nmediated by some \u2018enemy\u2019 \u2013 in this\ncase \u2018immigrants\u2019 or EU bureaucrats\n\u2013 to conservative \u2013 in the sense of\nconserving the current status quo \u2013 or\nreactionary policies.\nUKIP\u2019s economic policies are\nlargely conservative (although in\nanother sense, the current neoliberal\ndogma is radically utopian and\nnot conservative in the least), their\npolicies on immigration reactionary.\nThe prime reason for the growth\nof UKIP, however, is not the\nradicalisation of the British public as\nsuch, however, but the failure of the\ntraditional parties of the left to\n\n"

A patient suffering from\nrenal failure received her kidneys,\nwhile another received a donation of\nhepatocytes, which are cells that make\nup the bulk of liver tissue.\nDr Gaurav Atreja, consultant\nneonatologist at Hammersmith\nhospital said: \u201cIt is due to the extreme\ngenerosity of the parents and\nwonderful professional collaboration\nbetween the neonatal team and the\norgan donation team that this process\nwas successful.\n\u201cWe know for many families who\nsuffer the heartbreaking loss of a\nbaby or any family member, that the\ndonation of organs, which could help\nother sick patients to lead healthy\nlives, can provide a huge sense of\ncomfort.\u201d\nThis is the first time in the UK that\norgans have been donated from an\ninfant who was under 2 months old,\nalthough similar operations have\npreviously been performed in the\nUS, Germany and Australia, where\nguidelines differ.\nPeople who have suffered brain\nstem death, but whose heart is still\nbeating, are often suitable organ\ndonors. If the heart has stopped the\nbody is no longer receiving oxygen,\nand tissues will become irreparably\ndamaged very quickly. Donors are\noften kept on a ventilator to prevent\ndamage to their organs until they can\nbe transplanted.\nIn the case of very young children\nhowever, doctors are required to wait\nfor their heart to stop beating before\ncarrying out the transplant, as their\nnervous system is not sufficiently\ndeveloped for doctors to be certain\nthat their brain is no longer\nfunctioning. Unfortunately, this\nmeans that the blood supply to their\norgans is cut off for a time, risking\nlong term damage that would make\nthem unsuitable for transplanting\ninto another patient.\nAlthough it\u2019s extremely rare for\napproval to be obtained to use organs\nfrom very young babies, a 2014 study\nby Great Ormond Street Hospital\nfound that up to half the newborns\nwho died in their intensive care\nfacility could be eligible to donate\norgans. A review into the current\nguidelines, which prohibit doctors\nfrom diagnosing brain death in\nnewborns, will be published by the\nRoyal College of Paediatrics and\nChild Health later this year.\nHammersmith hospital: Two patients received tissues from the donor, a baby girl who died six days after birth.\nPhoto: Imperial\nJames Bezer on the new procedure performed at Imperial\nHubble takes 1.5 billion pixel photo of Andromeda\nJAMES BEZER\nSCIENCE EDITOR\nThe Hubble space telescope has\ntaken the highest resolution\nimage ever made of a galaxy.\nThe image is so detailed that it\u2019s\npossible to resolve individual stars in\na 61,000 light-year wide panorama.\nAndromeda is the Milky Way\u2019s\nnearest neighbour, 2.5 million\nlight- years away from us.

The LEGO Movie\ngot completely snubbed for Best\nAnimated Feature, and a lot of people\ngot very angry, very, very quickly.\nThe directors (Phil Lord and Chris\nMiller) responded in their typically\nwonderful style, with the former\nposting a picture of an Oscar statuette\nmade of LEGO, and the latter issuing\nheart-felt thanks to all involved in the\nfilm, as well as noting that \u201ceverything\n[was] not awesome.\u201d\nBut with the obvious outrage over\nan animated snub aside (even though\nit\u2019s true, The LEGO Movie has been\npre-emptively robbed), there\u2019s been\na more pressing and glaring issue, in\nthe complete overlooking of Selma\n\u2013 or, for that matter, any actor or\nactress of colour. Selma\u2019s Best Picture\nand Best Song nominations feel like a\ntoken gesture \u2013 a vague gesture in the\ndirection of a film that has won near-universal acclaim. Morten Tyldum\n\u2013 the director of The Imitation Game,\na film that was good because of its\nstrong lead performance, not its weak\ndirection \u2013 was nominated over Ava\nDuVernay, who produced something\ntruly incredible in Selma.\nElsewhere, there were some\ngenuinely valid nominations \u2013\nMichael Keaton\u2019s turn in Birdman\nis almost a dead cert, and rightly so,\nwhile Wes Anderson finally gets a\nnomination for his directing work\nfor The Grand Budapest Hotel, his\nfinest film to date.

Simmons nominated\nfor his appearance in Whiplash just\nfeels right.\nGuardians of the Galaxy sneaks\nin with two nominations \u2013 Visual\nEffects and Make-Up & Hair, while\nthe film that it was hoped would\nfinally mark British director\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s embrace by the\nAcademy falls a little short, with\nInterstellar only making appearances\nin the technical categories, albeit\ndeservedly so.\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag of nominations,\nall in all. There are some very, very\nright calls, and there are obvious\nfront-runners for the awards. But\nthere also some worrying omissions,\nwith the fact that the Academy is\npredominantly old, male and white\nbeing more obvious than it has in\nyears.\nFelix Film\u2019s Guide to Oscar betting\nAs the awards season builds up to its maximum climax that is the Oscars,\nit becomes increasingly easier to predict the winner. And so here are\nsome of the predictions in the popoular categories. Bet at your own risk.\nBest Picture: As shown in the poster above, the clear frontrunner here is\nBoyhood, a film of remarkable achievements that was made over the period of\ntwelve years. The only real competitor this faces is Birdman, but given how Boy\nhas triumphed over Bird in pretty much all the important awards thus far, the\ntop prize of the night is likely to go in favour of what has been dubbed 12 Years\na Boy, taken after last year\u2019s winning picture, 12 Years a Slave.\nBest Actor in a Leading Role:\nMichael Keaton, in his fantastic\nreturn to form in Birdman is bound\nto take home his first ever Oscar\nof his career. He does face stiff\ncompetition from audience-favourite\nEddie Redmayne of The Theory of\nEverything, but the Brit actor is far too\nyoung to be winning in this category.\nBest Actress in a Leading Role:\nJulianne Moore, believe it or not,\nhas never won an Oscar. She has\nbeen nominated a bunch of times\nand has sure been snubbed over the\nyears. 2015 will be her year, in her\nheart-breakingly real portrait of an\nearly-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patient, in\nStill Alice.\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role:\nJ. K. Simmons, who has long been\nworking as a character actor\nappearing in bit parts, finally has\nthe chance to shine as a ruthless,\nterrorising conductor of a jazz\nband. His supporting performance\nin Whiplash is winning all sorts of\naccolades, and rightfully so.\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role:\nPatricia Arquette\u2019s beautifully\nnuanced performance, spanning a\nperiod of over a decade, is a part of\nwhat makes this ambitious tale of\nBoyhood work so well. With a Golden\nGlobe already in the bag, an Oscar is\nlooking very much a likely scenario\nfor this underrated actress.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 19\nFELIX 23.01.2015\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk Tech Editors Jamie Dutton & Osama Awara\nThe art of war for faceless people\nThe previous few weeks have\nseen a surge in cyber warfare\nlike no other. From the\nSony Pictures hacking over The\nInterview \u2013 a satire film depicting\nthe assassination attempt of Kim\nJong-Un, to the ISIS hacking of US\nCentral Command Twitter account.\nThe hacktivist group Anonymous\nhave vowed to take down pro-Islamic\nextremist websites and social media\naccounts in light of the recent Paris\nattacks on Charlie Hebdo. The main\nobjective that all these hacks have\nin common is not necessarily to\nundermine security, but to create a\npsychological impact.\nTowards the end of November,\na group known as the \u2018Guardians\nof Peace\u2019, or GOP for short, were\nable to sneak into Sony\u2019s computer\nsystems and obtain ultrasensitive\ninformation. This ranged from top\nmovie casts\u2019 salaries, such as Seth\nRogan and James Franco, to private\nemails regarding Hollywood actor\nAdam Sandler\u2019s performance with his\nmovies described as \u201cmundane\u201d and\n\u201cformulaic\u201d. But by far the biggest\nweight these hacks had on Sony\nPictures and theatres across the US\nwas the fear factor of the 9/11 style\nattack threatened by GOP. It seemed\nthat GOP did not want the movie\nto be released at any cost which led\nmany to believe that North Korea was\nbehind the attack due to the leader\u2019s\nreverence by the regime. The US\ngovernment claimed that all evidence\npointed towards North Korea as the\nculprit with methods used in this\nattack similar to those used in a 2013\nhack on South Korean companies.\nAfter the terrorist threat made by\nGOP, theatres at the time chose\nnot to screen the movie and quite\nrightly due to fear for viewer safety.\nArguably the hackers had won in\nforcing The Interview not to be aired\nthrough their methods of coercion.\nNaturally this led to the criticism of\nSony for backing down, with Sony\ndefending itself by stating that it\nwas the theatres\u2019 choice to screen the\nmovie or not.\nWith regards to their actions,\nGOP were quoted as saying: \u201cWe\nwill clearly show it to you at the very\ntime and places The Interview be\nshown [sic], including the premiere,\nhow bitter fate those who seek fun\nin terror should be doomed to. Soon\nall the world will see what an awful\nmovie Sony Pictures Entertainment\nhas made. The world will be full of\nfear. Remember the 11th\nof September\n2001. We recommend you to keep\nyourself distant from the places at\nthat time.\u201d\nOne of the most important aspects\nof terrorism is the mental impact\nthat the aftermath of an attack\nhas. Regardless of the physical\nconsequences, if the terrorists see the\nreaction they desire then they have\nachieved their main objective. In the\ncase of the GOP attacks, the cyber-terrorists managed to obtain their\ndesired response. In order to salvage\na comeback over GOP, Sony decided\nto air the movie in select theatres\non Christmas day, making it also\navailable online for purchase or rent\ngrossing $17.8 million overall.\nAnother hack with a similar\nfear-inducing agenda was the most\nrecent cyber-attack from pro-ISIS\nhackers who dubbed themselves as\nthe Cyber Caliphate. They managed\nto compromise the Twitter account\nof US Central Command, filling\nthe account with ISIS propaganda\nand threats to US soldiers. The\nsignificance of this was that one of\nthe most feared groups in the world\nhad seized control of one of the\nmost prominent US government\norganisations and despite their reign\nlasting a mere 30 minutes, they\nwere able to deal significant mental\ndamage. The US Central Command\nwebsite commented in response:\n\u201cI recognize that this has caused\nsignificant angst among family and\nfriends who are understandably\nconcerned about their loved ones\u2019\nsafety. I want to personally reassure\nyou that we are taking this matter\nvery seriously and we continue to\ntake all possible measures to keep our\npersonnel safe.\u201d\nThe recent Charlie Hebdo attack\nin Paris, where 12 journalists were\nmurdered by two brothers claiming\nto avenge the Prophet Muhammad\ndue to cartoon depictions of him,\nbrought the concept of freedom\nFrom left to right: James Franco and Seth Rogen pick a poor time to announce their bromance, someone's getting sacked in the morning at US Central Command and people commemorating\nthe victims of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Photo credits: filmschoolrejects, ITV, The New Yorker.\nOsama Awara discusses the modern weaponisation of hacking\n\"Anonymous\nis looking\nto not only\ndo mental\ndamage but\nphysical\ndamage to its\nopponents\"\n\"The world\nwill be full of\nfear. Remember the 11th\nof September\n2001. Keep\nyourself dis-tant\"\nof speech into the spotlight. Many\npeople believed that this was a direct\nattack on their freedom of expression\nand went out in the streets of Paris\nto express solidarity with the Charlie\nHebdo victims. In response to the\nattack, Anonymous hacktivists have\ndeclared a cyber-war against terrorists\nnaming it \u201cOperation Charlie Hebdo\u201d\nor \u201cOpCharlieHebdo\u201d as its social\nmedia hashtag. The first website\nreported to have been taken down\nwas ansar-alhaqq.net, with the result\nof the attack posted on Anonymous\u2019s\nTwitter account. Anonymous is not\nout just to undermine the extremists\nthrough social media and website\nhacks but to also expose individuals\nwho are involved with extremism.\nAnonymous is looking to not only do\nmental damage but physical damage\non its opponents also, through their\nveteran experience in cyber warfare.\nAs we enter the second half of the\ndecade, it becomes ever clearer that\ncyber-attacks are more prominent\nin social media websites, illustrating\nthat hacking is no longer used merely\nfor obtaining sensitive information\nbut also for undermining the attacked\norganisation on a psychological level.\nCyber warfare is no longer about\nthe material gain. If you are going\nto keep up with the battle of minds\nyou are going to have to keep up with\nthe battle of tweets and posts. If you\ncontrol your opponent\u2019s tweets and\nposts, you will have a major advantage\non the mental platform.\n\n"

    "content": "36 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n23.01.2014\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis January sees the opening\nof the Gilbert & Ildiko\nButler drawings gallery\nat the Courtauld. The wonderful\npurpose built gallery, designed\nby 2013 Stirling prize winners\nWitherford Watson Mann Architects,\nfinally gives the public a chance to see\none of the most celebrated collections\nof drawings in the country. With\nover 7000 works, this is a remarkable\nopportunity to see a glimpse into the\noverlooked riches of the Courtauld\nInstitute.\nIn this first exhibition in the new\ngallery, Unseen presents a small\nselection of works, all of which have\nnot been exhibited at the gallery in\nthe last twenty years. Predominantly\nby lesser known artists, the works\nrange from the renaissance to the\ntwentieth century with a remarkable\nbreadth of subject matter and style.\nAlthough the works of some well-known artists are presented including\nRubens and Henry Moore, the true\ndelight of this exhibition is the\nnumber of works which show styles\nand technique often centuries before\ntheir time.\nCaricature of three Ecclesiastics\nby the high baroque painter Pier\nFrancesco Mola (1612 - 1666) is one\nof the most captivating works I have\nvery come across. In this highly\nstylised caricature, Mola depicts\na fattened bishop begging from\nhis comparatively malnourished\ncardinal. With the pope seated in\nthe background, this profound\nsatirical image not only feels like\na work from the 20th\ncentury but\ncould comfortably be shown in any\nsatirical magazine today and not\nfeel out of place. A sketch which\ncouldn\u2019t have taken the artist more\nthan ten minutes, the image gives\na remarkably deep insight into\nreligious tensions throughout Mola\u2019s\ncareer.\nShown by Mola\u2019s caricature\nand a number of other works, the\nexhibition is particularly successful\nin highlighting the artistic freedom\ndrawing offers artists.\nAt a time where the majority of\nmajor works were produced for the\naristocracy or the church, sketches\ncould often touch on subjects that\nlarger works couldn\u2019t. This is why\nMola\u2019s incredibly modern caricature\nis so profound.\nOther pieces such as Valentin\nKlotz\u2019 1675 work View of Grave\ngraphically depicts the destruction\nfollowing a siege against the heavily\ndamaged church of St. Elizabeth\nin the background. With the\nforeground littered with a number\nof cubic houses, delineated with\nnervous pen, the work shows a\nfascinating combination of realism\nand impressionism. Like Mola\u2019s\ncaricature, the modernity of Klotz\u2019\nstructures seem to be from another\ntime, not reflecting what is typically\nexpected from the late 17th century.\nThe exhibition also displays a\nnumber of more typical works\nincluding a number of including a\nstudy of the female head and a 1962\nwork by Larry Rivers, the \u201cgodfather\u201d\nof pop-art. While beautiful in their\nown right, they do not offer quite\nthe same surprise that a number of\nthe lesser works do. However, as a\ncollective, the pieces exhibited are a\nchristening for this wonderful new\nspace at the Courtauld. Spacious\nand incredibly well lit, the new\ngallery fills a gap in the Courtauld\u2019s\nrepertoire and will give the public\nanother gem to see when visiting the\ninstitute.\nUnseen \u2014 The Hidden Wealths that\nLie in the Depths of the Courtauld\nValentin Klotz, View of grave on the Mass after a siege, 1675. Image: The Courtauld Gallery\nAhipster little theatre in\nKilburn. A cast of young\nactors. An improvised piece\non the meaning of life. As far as hints\ngo, the Secret Theatre production\nof A Series of Increasingly Impossible\nActs hadn\u2019t got me too fired up. And\nyet, despite my initial reticence, I\nwas completely blown away by what\nproved to be a brave, hilarious and\nheart wrenching show.\nThe Secret Theatre formed a few\nyears back when the Lyric Theatre in\nHammersmith was undergoing huge\nbuilding works. In order to continue\nputting on shows ten young actors\njoined up to create unusual shows, in\nwhich the audience would turn up not\nknowing what would be performed or\nwhere it would be performed within\nthe building site. It turned out to be\na huge success and the company has\ncarried on producing shows in much\nthe same way, despite the fact that\nthey know have a fully-constructed\ntheatre.\nConfusingly, London has another\nSecret Theatre company (Secret\nTheatre London) which veils its\nshows in mysteries and forbids\nreviews from spilling the beans.\nPrepared for total secrecy, I was\nsurprised to see that a quick Google of\nA Series of Increasingly Impossible Acts\nreturned reviews openly sharing the\nmain outline was being referred to\nopenly: a cast member gets chosen by\nthe audience to undertake difficult,\nunpleasant or impossible tasks on\nstage.\nWhat\u2019s the point of a secret if\neveryone knows it already? Perhaps a\nbetter name would be the Unexpected\ntheatre \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the show\u2019s\nformat which was a surprise, but the\nemotional charge it carried.\nOn the night I went, Leo Bill\u2019s\nname was drawn out of the hat, and\nhe proceeded to be subjected to a\nfarcical fitness circuit: bending iron\nbars, licking his elbow, eating lemons.\nThis lap was repeated throughput\nthe show, a symbol of the change\nthe actor was undergoing under our\neyes. He was assaulted, offended,\nhurt, helped, teased, embarrassed and\nkissed by the rest of the cast, as the\nperformance turned into a journey\nof discovery of the actor. The journey\nwas subtle and natural, with moments\nof comedy punctuating an otherwise\nvery moving and touching show. By\nthe end of it I really felt as if I knew\nLeo very intimately \u2013 his hopes and\nhis humour, but mainly his fears,\ninsecurities and wounds, which he\nhad laid bare in front of the audience.\nYes, of course I know that the\nshow was semi-rehearsed, and that\nthe spontaneity stemmed from the\nactors\u2019 talent rather than from them\ntotally opening up on stage, but the\neffect it had was nevertheless truly\npoignant. The real physical duress\nthe actor undergoes strengthens the\nemotional upheaval you seem them\ngo through \u2013 the dialogue may well\nbe contrived, but you can\u2019t fake the\nacidity of a raw lemon, the cold of an\nice bucket or sweaty, shaky muscles\nafter a wrestling match.\nSomehow, through all the silliness,\nthe Secret Theatre has managed to do\nwhat all theatre strives to do \u2013 they\nstruck on something true. Something\nthat resonates at some deep level,\nby showing you that this is life.\nThis chaotic, difficult, loving, scary,\npointless and beautiful thing is life.\nThe Secret Theatre will perform all\nof their 6 shows between the 12th\nof\nFebruary and the 1st of March at the\nLyric in Hammersmith, as a farewell\nbefore the company parts. Tickets\nare \u00a315 and I really urge you to get\nyourselves some!\nThe Peculiar and Unexpected World\nof Secret Theatre\nA Series of Increasingly Impossible Acts.

What do you see?\nConsidering that all of you are\nstudying at Imperial College, there\nwill probably be people of different\nraces, nationalities, ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds all packed\ninto one room. Now take a closer\nlook. I\u2019ll wager that there will be a\ngroup of Chinese students bunched\ntogether in the front. the Indians will\nhave congregated somewhere around\nthe back. There will be a whole bunch\nof Europeans scattered around the\nroom, sitting together according to\ntheir nationalities, and the English\nwill probably be found all around the\nroom in two\u2019s or threes.\nAlthough the arrangement of the\ndifferent nationalities might vary\nfrom class to class, there is one thing\nthat will not; people from the same\ncountry will invariably end up sitting\ntogether. This national unity will\nnot be confined to the lecture hall;\nstudents will usually eat, live, go out\nand in general spend their entire\nuniversity lives with a small number\nof people and these people will in all\nlikelihood be from the same region,\nif not the same country. Don\u2019t believe\nme? Look closely at your own circles\nand you will know that I am right.\nThe single most important selling\npoint of an international education\nis the opportunity to meet and\ninteract with people from different\nbackgrounds and cultures. It is the\npromise of making friends with\npeople from all around the world\nand opening your mind to different\nto things that you would never have\nconsidered before and experiences\nthat you would not have otherwise\nhave had if you hadn\u2019t come to live\nabroad. By interacting only with\npeople from our own countries we are\ngreatly reducing our chances to grow\nand develop.\nI get it. Living thousands of miles\naway from your friends and family is\nscary and you are seeking comfort in\nthe familiar. There is nothing wrong\nwith that. Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s easier to\nmake friends with people from the\nsame culture as you because you\nprobably have experienced the same\nthings, celebrate the same holidays,\nhave watched the same movies or\nshows, eat the same kind of food and\nprobably have similar worldviews and\nopinions. Given all the similarities\nit\u2019s easier to bond and talk to people\nfrom the same country.\nAfter a point though, by spending\na point with a homogenous group\nof people your worldview becomes\nlimited and narrow. To really make\nthe most of your education you have\nto make an effort to overcome your\nfear and anxiety and move out of\nyour comfort zone to talk to people\nwho are different from you. Even if\nwe put personal growth aside for the\nmoment, the world of work today is\nbecoming increasingly globalized.\nIf we are even to survive in a global\nwork environment the ability to\nwork and make friends with people\nwho are different from us will be an\ninvaluable skill.\nNow that we have the why covered\nlet\u2019s move on to how you can make\nfriends with people from different\nbackgrounds.\nThe first and easiest way to meet\nnew people is by joining a society.\nSocieties are usually organized\naround an interest or hobby, allowing\nyou easy access to people from all\naround the world with whom you\ncan bond over your shared love of\nwhatever it is. Societies also tend to\norganize fun mixers and socials to\nmake it easier for their members to\nget to know each other in a relaxed\nenvironment.\nIf you are feeling particularly brave\nyou can even join a cultural society\nof a completely different culture. I\nonce knew an Indian girl who joined\nthe Cypriot society simply because\nshe was curious about Cyprus and its\nculture. She got on so well with the\nCypriots that she eventually went\non to become the social exec for the\nsociety.\nThe second way to meet new people\nis to not form a group with your\nfriends for class group work. Opt,\ninstead, to be randomly allocated to a\ngroup. When you enter the world of\nwork, you are not going to be able to\nchoose your team so why not try and\nwork with strangers and see how you\nhandle the challenge.\nLastly, and this is my personal\nfavourite, travel! Go to a new place\nand explore its history and culture.\nTry local foods and learn a bit more\nabout its folk art and stories. If\nmoney is an obstacle there are plenty\nof cheap deals for students that can\nbe found on the Internet. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter really where or with whom\nyou go but only that you do go and\nvisit as many places as you possibly\ncan.\nIt\u2019s human nature to be scared of\nthe unknown and the unfamiliar, but\ndon\u2019t let that fear stop you breaking\nout of your comfort zone, I can\npromise you from experience that\nyou will never be the same once you\ndo!\nMental illness affects a\nquarter of the population,\nyet at Imperial it\u2019s swept\nunder the rug. Alongside a small\ngroup of fellow students Bethany\nDavison is aiming to change this.\nThe new group Mentality is going to\nbe campaigning throughout the term\nto raise awareness, reduce the stigma\nsurrounding mental health and, most\nnotably, help people to seek support\nfor their problems. Suffering from\nmental health problems can be scary,\nisolating and confusing, especially\nMentality: IC Anti-Stigma Campaign\nwhen you feel there is nowhere to\nturn. Mentality seeks to highlight and\nclarify key points of access within\ncollege when seeking help.\nAdditionally, Mentality hopes\nto reduce the stigma surrounding\nmental health and educate students\nEMILY CRAMPHORN\nabout the importance of mental\nhealth. They aim to do this in\nnumerous ways including some\nactivities at an upcoming stall in\nSherfield. Why not come along to\nsee what it\u2019s about?\nNot sure how relevant this photo is, but I couldn't find anything more adorable to get the message across.\nCredit: Kerry Clark\n\n"

It\u2019s all properly wood-fired\u2013yes,from that\nlittle truck! He also has an adjoining stall selling\nlittle food tidbits like buffalo mozzarella,amaretti\nbiscuits and pecorino flown in from Italy...as well\nas my Achilles\u2019heel: home-made nduja sausage.If\nI weren\u2019t skint at the time I would\u2019ve bought their\nwhole stock; at \u00a32.50 for a decent-sized portion,\nthough,I managed to get enough.Call me biased,\nbut I find even Whole Foods\u2019offering just isn\u2019t spicy\nenough for me.\nImperialites living near these areas can check\nthem out at Brook Green Market and Kitchen on\nBolingbroke Road (Saturdays 10am-3pm),and The\nFood Market Chiswick on Grove Park Farm House\n(Sundays 10am-2pm).All 9 inch pizzas are a fiver; tell\nBruno or Silvio that Carol sent you\u2013enjoy!\n\"One\nadvantage\nyou\u2019re going\nto have here\nis that you\ncan add\nlots more\nunprocessed\ncolour and\nflavour.\"\nHappy 2015, everyone! Between\ndeadlines in early January,\nprepping for new module\nlectures this term and catching up\nwith the stuff I missed last term\nwhen the Vile Bug of Winter \u201814 hit\nImperialites (and their dogs...) finding\ntime to cook decent meals has been\nrather difficult: So difficult that the\nheadline pun this week is an awfully\npoor reference to what most of us\nhave been doing during the exam\nweek just gone.\nI digress. As the academic year\nresumes and speed picks up, I\u2019ll gladly\nadmit my meal routines easily suffer.\nThough thanks to the combined\ngenius that is Hugh FearnleyWhittingstall (the River Cottage\nbloke, yes!) and J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (of\nThe Food Lab on Seriouseats.com),\nI may have found one of my new\nfavourite fallback lunches. It\u2019s even\neasier and quicker than my favourite\nmushroom and cream pasta, or my\nfried rice mainstay \u2013 these being my\nusual no-brainer solutions to a quick,\nhealthy and filling meal.\nLadies and gents of the Imperial\nrealm, I present to you a somewhat-instant noodle solution that\u2019s full\nof POTential, yet only requires\nyou to Just Add Water(TM)\nwhen it\u2019s\nmealtime. (No, I\u2019m not apologizing\nfor this pun either.)\nBut first: why even bother?\nYou don\u2019t need me to tell you\nabout the perils of conventional\npot noodles: everything from the\nnutritional value (or lack thereof),\nto the fact that it\u2019s not the most\nappetizing-looking thing you can\nhave; two things which the solution\nI\u2019m about to show you fixes very well.\nFelix Food published an \u201cEpic(ally\nBroke) Meal Time\u201d feature in the last\nissue of Summer 2013, with ideas on\nturning boil-in-the-pot instant ramen\ninto a cheap gourmet meal.\nThat\u2019s all and well when you have\naccess to a stove, but how about if\nyou\u2019re constantly at your desk? It\u2019s\nactually easier than you think to DIY\nsome cup noodles to your tastes.\nThe best way to come up with\na variety of flavour options is to\n\u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the components\nof your \u201cpot noodle\u201d meal, and then\ndo a bit of mixing and matching.\nWe\u2019ll go over each component\nseparately; think of this as a method\noverview rather than a recipe per se.\nThe soup (base)\nFull disclosure: this is the bit that is\ngoing to contribute the underlying\nflavour and salt to the whole meal, so\nit\u2019s wise to be prudent with the base\nthat you end up using. The Food Lab\nswears by Better Than Bouillon soup\nbase (available on Amazon), which\nhas quite a substantial meat content;\nour River Cottage master uses good-quality bouillon powder/cubes. The\nkey takeaway is that it has to be\nconcentrated to save space, and as dry\nas possible so it stays fresh for longer.\nIf you go down the bouillon route,\nyour OXO and Knorr mainstays\njust aren\u2019t going to cut it here. The\nflavour quality just isn\u2019t up to snuff,\nand the salt content is going to give\nyou a heart attack in more ways than\none. I\u2019ve found that Kallo isn\u2019t too\nshabby for this; they make \u201cvery low\nsalt\u201d versions that don\u2019t skimp on\nthe flavour. In the meantime though\nI\u2019m actually coming up with a base\nalternative to Better than Bouillon;\nthere will be a sequel to this article \u2013\nwith other ideas \u2013 when it\u2019s perfected!\nMost of the time, I tend to amplify\nthe bouillon base with other sauces\nand pastes in my larder. Miso,\ngochujang, black or yellow bean...\nthere are loads of options out there. It\njust adds that much more complexity\nto the dish. I\u2019ve even used homemade\nkimchi as a flavour booster before!\nYour meat and (two) veg\nOne advantage you\u2019re going to have\nhere is that you can add lots more\nunprocessed colour and flavour.\nIt\u2019s important however that you\nNEVER use raw meat; it\u2019s not going\nto properly cook when you add water.\nMeat plucked from a supermarket\nroast chicken (or from leftover\nSunday roast) works well, though you\ncan get amazing results with beef\nbiltong/jerky.\nFor the veggie component, small\ndiced frozen veg is great for this. I\u2019ve\nused everything from grated carrot\nand julienned bell peppers to raw\nsliced mushrooms.\nThe freshness doesn\u2019t stop there. I\nalmost always keep a plastic packet\nof chopped herbs/scallions to garnish\nwhen the noodles are \u2018done cooking\u2019.\nThe noodle noggin\u2019\nSo now you\u2019ve eschewed the pre-fried\nramen, the easiest noodles to use\nin these are rice noodles \u2013 namely\nvermicelli, or the flat stuff used in\npad thai. After that, fresh egg noodles\n(the \u2018straight-to-wok\u2019 kinds in chiller\ncabinets) work well.\nIf you really must use dried noodles\nor pasta, it\u2019s definitely worth par-cooking them a bit, then shocking\nthem in cold water to stop them from\ncooking any further. You might find\nsome of the straight-to-wok noodles\nmight need a bit of help as well.\nFrom here, I\u2019ll drain and toss them\nin a wee bit of oil (sesame preferred)\nto stop them from sticking, then add\nthem to the jar I\u2019m using.\nThe vessel\nYou want something that\u2019s pint-sized\nonwards. Glass jars are great; recycle\na mason/jam jar if you have one that\nsize. I\u2019m a sucker for loads of veggie\nin my dish though, so the volume\nof my clip-top jar (Kilner and Tala\nmake loads of them) is more like\n700ml. Just be careful of the amount\nof boiling water you add if you use a\nbigger jar; it\u2019s easy to add too much\nand over-dilute your soup.\nAll in all...\n...I love these because I still get a fairly\nbalanced meal that doesn\u2019t skimp on\nthe convenience, and forces me to get\ncreative while \u201cthinking inside the\npot\u201d. Over to you guys now!\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 27\nFELIX 16.01.2015\nTelevision Editors Guila Gabrielli & John Park\nTelevision\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine: For Your Consideration\nSitcoms are notoriously hard to\nget right; and cop genre comedies\nespecially so. TV history is full\nof huge success stories and miserable\nfailures. For every triumphant series\nthere are four or five flops, many\nof which never even make it to the\npilot stage. But despite the significant\nchallenges involved in creating\na popular situational comedy,\nthe occasional show is destined\nto succeed. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is\none such success story. Created by\nMichael Schur and Daniel J. Goor,\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine is arguably 2014\u2019s\nbest new comedy series and has only\njust premiered in the UK.\nThe single-camera series follows\na team of detectives and a newly\nappointed captain in the fictional 99th\nPrecinct of the New York City Police\nDepartment in Brooklyn. Captain\nRay Holt (Andre Braugher) takes\nover the precinct, which includes\nJake Peralta (Andy Samberg), a gifted\nbut childish detective whose nonconformist practices inexorably\nbecome questioned by his new\nCommanding Officer. The main cast\nincludes Detective Amy Santiago\n(Melissa Fumero), Jake\u2019s driven and\ndiligent partner; Detective Charles\nBoyle (Joe Lo Truglio), Jake\u2019s people-pleasing and hardworking friend;\nDetective Sergeant Terry Jeffords\n(Terry Crews), a keen bodybuilder\nwho recently left field work after\nthe birth of his baby girls; Detective\nRosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), a\nrugged and mysterious coworker;\nand Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti),\nthe precinct\u2019s cynical yet perceptive\nadministrator.\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine packs in the\njokes, ranging from very smart\nto very stupid. The series seems\nrefreshingly playful and there\nJOSHUA RENKEN\nSECTION WRITER\nis a noticeable effort to get in a\nsubstantial amount of character\ndevelopment for by sitcom\nstandards. For instance, Captain\nRay Holt is one of the most nuanced\nand multidimensional gay men\nI\u2019ve ever seen on television. Holt\nsuffered in the NYPD and despite\nmany years of outstanding service\nto the department, has only just\nbeen promoted to the position of\nCommanding Officer. He ascribes\nthis to prejudice against his\nhomosexuality and created a group\nthat supported gay African-American\nNYPD members to address the\nproblem. The Captain himself shows\nlittle in the way of outward emotion\n(something which the cast regularly\nrefer to) but proves to be an attentive\nand considerate boss who cares deeply\nfor his team.\nDespite the core power struggle\nbetween Holt and Peralta, Brooklyn\nNine-Nine is very much an ensemble\nseries. In shows of this kind, it is often\nthe case that the group will feature\none or two characters that aren\u2019t quite\nas funny or developed as the others.\nHowever, each actor seems perfectly\ncast for the part and they all get a\nshare of the big laughs.\nThe series employs flashbacks\nthat make for interesting pacing\nand character advancement. If\nthe dialogue contains some highly\nconvenient piece of information,\nyou can bet someone will point out\nthat it was far too convenient. Yes it\u2019s\nAmerican and yes it\u2019s a little corny\nat times, but far less cheesy than\nthe likes of The Big Bang Theory or\nsome other cringe-inducing sitcom.\nTo be clear, I admire the writing of\nThe Big Bang Theory, but somehow I\ncan\u2019t stand watching it. I\u2019ve probably\npolarised the audience there. Okay,\nI (don\u2019t really mind/honestly loathe)\nThe Big Bang Theory. Delete according\nto your prejudices. Happy now?\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine grows on\nyou like any effective sitcom until\nyou crave the sense of warmth and\nfamiliarity that the characters give\nyou. It is this emotional investment\nin the characters that makes a\npopular sitcom look like gold dust to a\ntelevision network. An added benefit\nto well defined characters is that the\nplot can occasionally be less engaging\nin and of itself and the quality\nwon\u2019t suffer. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is\nan example of one such series and\nthe quality over the first 22 twenty-minute episodes only improved as it\nwent on.\nIt goes for more enlightened jokes\nand often deals with topics such\nas race, gender and sexuality in an\nintelligent manor. All this, combined\nwith the motley crew of personalities\nand the peculiar scenarios they\nare put in, makes for high quality\namusement that warms the cockles\nof our cold, cold hearts. If you are\nlooking for an entertaining and\nuplifting sitcom to watch during a\nbreak from revision or just to relax,\nthen Brooklyn Nine-Nine might just be\nfor you.\nThe first series is now on Netflix and\nthe show premiered in the UK on E4\nJanuary 15th.\n2015 Golden Globe winning television stars\nThe Winners:\nKevin Spacey, House of Cards\nRuth Wilson, The Affair\nJeffrey Tambor, Transparent\nGina Rodriguez, Jane the Virgin\nBilly Bob Thornton, Fargo\nMaggie Gyllenhaal, The Honourable\nWoman\nMatt Bomer, The Normal Heart\nJoanne Froggatt, Downton Abbey\nBest Drama: The Affair\nBest Comedy: Transparent\nBest Mini-Series: Fargo\nPhoto: Dan Goor, Michael Schur, Universal Television\n\n"

The\nsurvey asked students where it should\ntake place, attendee eligibility, and for\npotential theme suggestions.\nOver 200 people replied to the\nsurvey. The gender split of those that\nreplied was reflective of the Imperial\nratio as a whole.\nSubsequent comments promoting\nthe survey on the Imperial Secrets\npost was made by a fake profile,\nnamed \u201cThe-Orgy Master.\u201d The\nprofile photo was a rather erotic snap\nof what appeared to be an eastern\nAsian family in their underwear,\npotentially taken in the eighties.\nThe Facebook profile, and the\nsurvey asking people to take part in an\norgy, were managed by four first-year\nstudents of Imperial. The students\nare a mixture of males and females\nfrom the chemistry and engineering\ndepartments, but they are unaware of\nwho runs Imperial Secrets.\nThey spoke to Felix about the stunt,\nand why they did it. \u201cOn seeing the\nImperial Secrets page we saw there\nwas a high demand of students with\nfrustrated sexual needs.\u201d\n\u201cAt first it was just a joke but after\nseeing 200 people sign up to the event\nwe thought it might be interesting to\nsee if people would buy tickets, 4 of\nwhom did.\u201d\nStudents who signed up through\nthe survey were sent a confirmation\nemail from imperialorgy@gmail.\ncom, which is jointly run by the four\nstudents. The email stated that the\ntheme of the orgy would be \u201cJIHAD.\u201d\nIt also informed them that tickets\nwould be below \u00a315 and would cover\nthe costs of a hotel room, condoms,\nmasks and alcohol.\nThe email also requested that people\nsend photos \u201cfor judgement NOW,\u201d to\ndecide on who could take part. It went\non to gallantly state that \u201cjudgement\nof girls will be very lenient but still\nsend a picture!\u201d, though the authors\nwere also generous enough to offer\nfree tickets to those that send in\n\u201cfemale jihad costume pictures\u201d.\nThe students told us that the \u201cJihad\u201d\ntheme was not the only preference\ncited by those that filled in their\nform. They said to Felix: \u201cMany [of\nthe themes suggested] were worse\nthan jihadi. We just found that one\nhumorous - plus we don\u2019t stand for\nterrorism so why not ridicule it?\u201d\nThe students told us other themes\nsuggested via the online survey\nincluded, but were not limited to,\nHitler, a Children\u2019s party, S&M,\nTeletubbies and, the most Imperialsounding of them all, one based\non the Periodic Table of elements.\nApparently those who are lonely\ncould have attended as \u201cone of the\nnoble gases.\u201d\nThe fake Facebook profile later\nconfirmed that \u201cfour people had\npurchased tickets,\u201d and stated the\nnames of the students in full. These\nwere taken down a few days later,\nalthough were publically viewable\nfor anyone who clicked on the profile\nthrough the Imperial Secrets page,\ncurrently approaching 3,000 likes.\nFelix contacted the students\nnamed as ticket buyers, and those\nthat replied said they were unhappy\nbeing named in full on such a public\nprofile. The students have also said\nthat as far as they are aware, no\nmoney has changed hands. Some told\nus that they were just signed up by\nfriends as a joke.\nHowever two were particularly\nupset, as they didn\u2019t think their\nnames would be made so public. Said\none: \u201cI am frankly annoyed that any\ninformation was released. It\u2019s really\nnot okay to do this kind of thing.\u201d\nThe students behind the page said\nthey were sorry for publishing the\nnames, and \u201cAs a group [we] apologise\ndeeply for any harassment or abuse\nthat may have ensured.\u201d\nThe final question is, will the orgy\nbe taking place? Sadly it seems, it will\nnot. Concluded the four students\nbehind the stunt: \u201cLogistics would\nhave been too difficult.\u201d\nBack to the drawing board then.\nMain Photo: The final confirmation sent that first mentioned the \"Jihad\" theme.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 7\nFELIX 23.01.2015\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFelix investigates: the admin that\ndidn\u2019t remain anonymous\nFelix has reason to believe that\na single student may be behind\nmany of the popular Imperial\nFacebook pages.\nWe suspect the individual has\nnow graduated, after completing\nan undergraduate degree in\nAeronautics. Felix has managed to\nprocure email correspondence and\npersonal anecdotes from a number of\nstudents, giving us more information\non the individual behind many of\nthe popular pages that students are\nposting to currently, and that were\nactive last year.\nThe student started at Imperial\nin 2008, and has been intrinsically\nlinked to the now defunct Tell\nSomeone Something (TSS) page,\nHumans of Imperial (HoI) and 4th\nFloor Central Library. Felix also\nsuspects he was also behind Imperial\nSecrets in its infancy, although we are\nyet to confirm he is still the admin of\nImperial Secrets this year.\nThe individual was first linked to\nthe Imperial TSS page after making\nan admin post during the last RAG\nWeek, asking for sponsorship under\nthe name \u201cTSS Admin\u201d to take part\nin their annual bungee jump. After\napproaching the stall and presenting\nthe funds raised through a post on the\npage, he had to give the committee\nhis full name and CID number.\nThe same student was also\nidentified as the photographer, and\nand probably the admin, of Humans\nof Imperial last year, as he would\napproach students and staff himself\nto post their photos on the page. The\nposts on HoI though are all amicable\nand friendly, and ownership of the\npage has since been transferred to a\nteam of five students still at Imperial.\nFor the TSS page, members of\nImperial could anonymously send in\nmessages via a Google form, which\nwere then collated and published. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for the TSS page to\ncome under fire for its content, which\nranged from racist and sexist posts to\ndefamatory ones.\nThese included posts labelling\nan individual as a \u201cn*****r\u201d and\n\u201c[smelling] awfully bad\u201d, accusing a\nhall warden of sniffing the underwear\nof students, and asking a student with\na \u201cfugly Indian-Chinese\u201d partner\n\u201cwhat\u2019s it like putting a piece of s***\ninto your vagina every night\u201d.\nComplaints made by students\nabout objectionable content, as well\nas requests to remove said content,\nwere repeatedly defended under a\n\u201cfreedom of speech\u201d banner. This is\nin spite of the fact that legally, the\nadmin of a page is responsible for all\npublished content under defamation\nlaws. At this point, the page had\namassed just under 3000 likes.\nSeveral people whose full names\nwere published on the page made\nuse of Facebook\u2019s \u201cReport Abuse\u201d\nsystem, as well as directly messaging\nthe admin of TSS to remove the\nposts. These were met with threats\nand a spike in the targeted bullying\nmessages on both the page and an\naffiliated Twitter account.\nIn one instance, when asked by one\nstudent to remove defamatory posts\ntowards them, the admin became\ndefensive and threatened to post\nmore. When asked for the name(s) of\nthose posting the abuse, the admin\nreplied: \u201cDon\u2019t bite the hand that\nfeeds, dear lady. Do what you think is\nright, we know we will.\u201d A post from\nthe admin subsequently appeared on\nTSS, encouraging those who authored\nthe threats to confront the victim\ndirectly.\nFollowing this, they continued\nto post abusive and upsetting posts\nconcerning that student on a daily\nbasis before the group was shut down.\nHypocritically, while the admin\nrefused to censor offensive remarks\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nNEWS EDITOR\nagainst students, comments that\nquestioned or were critical of the page\nwere swiftly moderated. At one point,\na student\u2019s complaint regarding an\ninsensitive joke about the missing\nMH370 flight was removed, but the\npost containing the joke was allowed\nto remain. A post with the same\nMH370 joke is still visible on the 4th\nFloor Central Library page.\nThe issue was escalated to ICT, with\nscreenshots of their conversation\nwith the admin included in the\ncomplaint. However, ICT dismissed\nthe complaint and said there was\nnothing they could do, as Facebook\npages were beyond their control.\nRAG released details of the admin\nto Imperial College Union to aid\nwith their investigation into abusive\nFacebook pages. The individual was\nreported to the College Tutors, a\ngroup of department-independent\nsenior pastoral advisers, in a series\nof emails sent from the Union. No\nformal action was taken against\nhim, however meetings were held\nbetween College Tutors, the Union\nand students affected by the cyberbullying posts on the page.\nWhile College and the Union were\ncollating evidence against the admin\nresponsible, a number of the more\noffensive posts and comments started\nto disappear from the TSS page. The\npage admin then published an open\nletter, seemingly speaking out against\nbullying. However, students believed\nthis was an attempt by the page owner\nto whitewash their actions.\nDespite the Union advising against\nit, following an article by The Tab\nImperial during the course of the\ninvestigation, the Imperial TSS page\nwas removed from Facebook, leading\nto the investigation being suspended\nindefinitely. The Tab were unaware\nof the progress of the Union\u2019s\ninvestigation, with the reporter in\nquestion later saying that they were\nnot aware that the College had been\ngiven a name from the Union.\nAll three pages cited here (Imperial\nTSS, 4th Floor Central Library, and\nHumans of Imperial) feature(d)\nidentical posting styles, graphical\ndesign and use of language. These\nfeatures are also consistent with the\nImperial Secrets page.\nLastly, Imperial TSS and Imperial\nSecrets bore huge similarities in how\ntheir header graphics mimicked the\ngraphic identity of Imperial College,\nespecially in font and colour scheme.\nFelix has spoken to those who\npreviously lived in halls with the\nstudent believed to be behind the\npages, and also cast a net further to\nfind more out about his background.\nThe individual has been confirmed\nas suffering from a number of health\nissues, and often exhibited irrational\nbehavioural patterns.\nThose in halls reported that he\nwas asked to move out due to a long\nstint of thieving food and equipment\nfrom the kitchens over an extended\nperiod of time. The individual was\nonly caught once, as those who shared\na kitchen with him planted a camera\novernight, and repeatedly caught him\non film emptying the fridges and\ncupboards.\nThere are also a number of reports\nin the public domain about the\nindividual being involved in multiple\ncases of theft in his home country\nduring a year out from Imperial,\ncomplete with pictures. This has\nsubsequently led to a criminal record,\nas well as a fine and jail time.\nCollege were unable to provide us\nwith a reason for the suspension of\nthe investigation, stating that \u201caction\ntaken by the College is considered\non a case-by-case basis. It would\nnot be appropriate to comment on\nindividual cases.\u201d\nWe emailed the individual in\nquestion for comment, although they\ndid not respond. Separate attempts to\ncontact the Imperial Secrets and 4th\nFloor Central Library pages also went\nunanswered.\n\n"
