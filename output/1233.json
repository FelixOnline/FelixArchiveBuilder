He also throws in\nsome sampled speeches and quotations,\nwhich sustain the feeling of era and\nplace - the album is lodged squarely in\nsixties America.\nUnfortunately, whilst the album starts\nwith very distinctive, exciting tracks, the\nnovelty wears off. Whilst it undoubtedly\nhas cohesion, it doesn't possess the stylistic variety of, say, the Pulp Fiction\nsoundtrack, which is perhaps its closest\ncounterpart in terms of celebrating the\nmusic of sixties America. Even as the CD\nfinishes, I can't help feeling that there\nshould have been a more significant ending - a twist, a curve-ball that the listener would never have seen coming.\nThat aside, Come Get It I Got It does\ncontain some of the finest songs known\nto humanity and fully deserves your\nundivided attention.\nID Cornershop\nHandcream For A Generation\nOut now on Wiiija records\nBefore I begin, why not take a minute to\nlisten to the music press as they gush\nabout Cornershop's latest offering:\n\"warm and righteous sunshine...\"\n(NME); \"an early contender for album of\nthe year\" (The Independent). Now, I 've\nnever been one to fly in the face of public\nopinion, but on this occasion, I will have\nto give it a beating, dress it in a clown\noutfit and leave it lying in the gutter.\nAfter 1997's eclectic and satisfying\nWhen I Was Born For The 7th Time, this\nnew release comes as a disappointment.\nWhile When I Was Born... was inventive\nin a number of senses (the rhythms,\nmelodies and general vibes were a real\nassortment), this is a same y and over-catchy turkey of a record.\nThe good points first - no track on its\nown sounds particularly bad. Lessons\nLearned From Rocky I To Rocky III is\nfunky and bizarre, Music Plus 1 is good\nfor the dancefloor, and Heavy Soup is\npleasant enough. The best track is probably Spectral Mornings, which features\nNoel Gallagher's indifferent strumming.\nBut as a whole, Handcream For A Generation is not much more than i rr it at ing. Motion The 11 is possibly the lowest\npoint, but when singing children turn up\non Staging The Plaguing Of The Raised\nPlatform, I know I 've had quite enough.\nPatrick ODD Derek\nCOMPETITION\nWe've got a copy of Come Get It I Got It (see review, above left) to give away.\nQUESTION: David Holmes wrote the soundtrack to which recent film?\nPlease email your answer, along with your name, year and department, to\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday 2 May.\nThe winner of the A album (Issue 1231) is Emily Yeomans of Biology I. Cyclefly\nCrave\nOut now on MCA records\nCyclefly are a bit of a mystery. Comprised\nof two Irishmen, two Frenchmen and an\nItalian, the Cork-based quintet have definitely got something strange going on.\nTheir last album Generation Sap was\nreleased three years ago, and fans have\nbeen waiting anxiously to see if the\nmulti-national boys can come up with\nthe goods again. And have they?\nThankfully, the answer is a resounding\nyes.\nFor owners of Generation Sap, a warn-ing: this album is nowhere near as punk\nas the last. In fact, the appearance of\nLinkin Park's Chester Bennington on the\ndesperately tense track Karma Killer\ndemonstrates that Cyclefly have almost\nturned to nu-metal.\nThe album begins with No Stress, the\nforthcoming single. This is amet ally track, with plenty of low-pitched guitar\nriffs and gravelly vocals. Then, Cyclefly\nprogress through slightly darker territory\n(Karma Killer and Selophane Fixtures),\ninfluenced perhaps by Tool and the early\nSmashing Pumpkins.\nThen we come to the title track Crave,\nwhich is surprisingly different from the\nfirst three tracks on the album, being\nvery soft and tender. Other recommendations include the quiet, almost gothic\nCrowns and the very dark Weary, which\nfeatures some interesting chord progressions. This is definitely no \"difficult second\nalbum\", but it is perfectly possible that\nold fans could be slightly disappointed.\nThen again, they could be thrilled - as I am - that Cyclefly have found a few new\ntricks and are using them with gusto.\nD Jess\n\n"

    "content": "union talk\nThe Union - A New Beginning\nThe last few months have seen a great\ndeal of change for the Union and College.\nUnder the stewardship of the Rector, the\nCollege has undergone many changes. We\nwill see the creation of four Faculties, a sustained drive towards improving the\nglobal brand of Imperial, fund raising to\ndevelop our estate and setting up an\nendowment to provide scholarships to the\nbest students. These changes have been\nimplemented to ensure that Imperial\nCollege continues to be one of the leading\nhigher education institutes in the world.\nThe Union too has taken the opportunity\nto review its operations. After one of the\nwidest consultation process in recent\nyears we have a new way forward. Gone\nare the old Constituent College Unions and\nin come Student Faculty Associations.\nCouncil has been changed to allow more\nordinary students to participate in the governance of the Union and a new information policy will allow for more transparency in the Union a drm nist ration. This represents a new beginning for the\nUnion and a new direction for our mem-be rs. One of the biggest challenges we\nface is to ensure that we work more effectively to deliver practical and tangible benefits to students.\nFunding\nOne of the key issues the Union faces is\nfunding. It is clear that funding from the\ngovernment is not enough to support the\nactivities of the College and consequently\nthe Union. We are still heavily reliant on\nCollege for provision of funds. The Union\ngets some \u00a3885,000 from College, it uses\nthis to provide a wide range of facilities\nand services for students and this figure is\ngenerally tied with the rate of inflation.\nHowever, more and more students are\nparticipating in the Union and using its\nservices. If we want to continue to sustain\nthis growth, we have to seek funding from\nelsewhere. I believe the Union has to\nactively engage in partnerships with external organisations and individuals.\nRecent examples have been the\nGoldman Sachs support of the night bus\nservice and the collaboration with the\nCollege Wider Participation programme to\nsuccessfully bid for over \u00a3350,000 for volunteer support over the next three years.\nThese partnerships represent the way forward and over the coming months the\nUnion has to increase these types of partnerships in all its areas of operation.\nVolunteers\nEarly on in the year we made it clear that\nvolunteer support is crucial to the future of\nthe Union. The Union has more student\nvolunteers than any other in the country\nand we are heavily reliant on the support\nof these volunteers to conduct our act iv i ties. However we have very little in place\nto support volunteers in the Union. One of\nthe most important priorities for the next\nfew months is to establish a volunteer\nmanagement programme, one that will\nactively look at how we recruit, train and\nreward the volunteers in the Union. We\nhave taken the first steps in this process;\nthe Union has appointed a new member of\nstaff to co-ordinate student activities and\nanother will be appointed shortly to coordinate volunteering in the community. In\naddition a new rewards scheme will be\nlaunched later this term, but this is just the\nstart, we have a long way to go to deliver\na comprehensive and integrated pro-gram me. Sites\nOne of the other key challenges for the\nUnion is the way we deal with the many\ncampus sites. Imperial has a large number\nof sites dotted around London and the\nSouth of England and ensuring good communication between them is crucial.\nThe Union needs to dedicate more\nresources towards integrating the sites\ninto the centre. There is no doubt that\nSouth Kensington will continue to remain\nthe headquarters for the Union, but we\nmust continue to develop facilities and\nservices on other campuses such as the\nnew bar at Charing Cross and the gyms at\nWye and Silwood.\nThe culture\nIn addition to these new strategies, the\nUnion has to introduce a more dynamic\nand pro-active culture. The environment in\nwhich we operate is changing rapidly, we\ncannot simply wait for things to happen\nand react to them, we must learn to anticipate situations and act appropriately. This\nis of course not without its risks and\nindeed pursuing such a policy will lead to\nsome mistakes being made. We will have\nto accept them and move on because in\nthe end I believe that we will deliver a better Union to our members.\nHere at Imperial there has been constant\ntalk of apathy amongst the student populous. I do not believe that is necessarily\ntrue. Recently the Union called for a referendum on our affiliation to the NUS. After'\na hard campaign fought by both sides, we\nhad one of the largest turnouts for any col-leg e wide ballot in recent years, showing\nstudents care about the issues and will\nparticipate in the governance of the Union.\nWe must continue to build on this and it\nis important for students to realise that\ndecisions made v nth in the Union can have\nan impact on life at Imperial.\nThe future\nIf we are going to pursue with the development of the Union then we must face up\nto our challenges. It is important that the\nUnion clarifies its vision and develops long\nterm strategies to meet these goals. For\nthe first time we have two year sabbaticals which I believe will be crucial to\nensuring continuity and development of\nthese strategies.\nThe year ahead promises to be an interesting and challenging one. We have\nachieved a lot this year, but there is much\nmore to do. The way forward will rely on\nimproving services to our students, forming external partnerships, integrating\nsites and building support for volunteers.\nIt is important that students continue to\nplay an active part in this process to\nensure that the Union fulfils its aim in\nmeeting the needs of the students.\nSen Ganesh, Union President\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nINTERVIEW with\nManu Chao\nCompared to my usual hungover Wednesdays, chasing the elusive French pop star Manu Chao around London was quite a turn-up for the books.\nAfter I'd found the right venue - changed by Manu - and waited half an hour, the man himself walked in, looking like any ordinary blok e you'd sit next to on the tube, with his ever-present\nbeanie. Some jumped up to greet the musician with the fer v our of teenage girls at a pop concert. Maybe they were just his\nfriends. Anyway, Manu sat at the corner of a large table, surrounded by the groupies, while journalists from student and\nnational media jostled for his attention.\nThe slightly strange interview began with the predictable\nquestions about his \"inspiration\", before progressing to the\nsubject of his two recent UK gigs.\nFELIX: How does the English crowd compare to France and\nSouth America?\nMANU: Really well. They were really excited on both nights,\nand I was surprised that people actually know my stuff here.\nWere you surprised that the crowd knew the songs you did\nwith Mano Negra [his old band]?\nYes, it was a great to see that people knew that stuff, but I think\na lot of the crowd were from South America and so had heard a lot of my other music.\nDid the time you spent in Brazil make your music sound more\nBrazilian?\nYes, it did influence me a lot, but I think Brazilian music has\nbeen ... [speaks in Spanish for a bit] ... pigeonholed too much.\nThey are making so much music and such a wide range that you\ncannot just say it sounds Brazilian. But yes, I loved a lot of the\nmusic I heard out there.\nWhat do you think of the state of latin music worldwide?\nThe music in South America is really exciting, but the \"latin\"\nmusic coming from Miami has nothing to do with it. They have\nleft behind their roots and changed to an American way of life,\nand they aren't making real latin music any more. It is a shame,\nbecause everyone in South America wants to go to Miami - they\nall see it as some sort of paradise. The same thing happens in\nAfrica - the people I know there all want to get to Europe, which\nin their minds is this paradise.\nSince you seem to have strong views on these topics, have\nyou ever considered moving into politics?\n[Looks offended] No, not at all, I am not interested in politics. It\nis all corrupt - all of Miami is run by the mafia, and the governments no longer have any control over what is going on. It is all\ncontrolled by organised crime or large companies. I am only\ninterested in affecting the neighbourhood where I can see\neffects of what I do. My neighbour in Barcelona was a fascist,\nand would not talk to my girlfriend [who is black], but now he\nhas changed and he always speaks to her in the morning. He\nsaw me the other morning and came to say how beautiful he\nthought she was!\nOUT THIS WEEK\nThe following are due for release on Monday 29 April:\nALBUMS\nBLUE LIGHT FEVER Blue Light Fever\nDAN THE AUTOMATOR - Wanna Buy A Monkey?\nFISCHERSPOONER - #1\nPITCHSHIFTER - PSI\nREDEFINE - The Daisychain Cycle\nTHE SUICIDE MACHINES - Steal This Record\nSINGLES\nTIMO MAAS feat MC CHICKABOO - Shifter\nMOBY - We Are All Made Of Stars\nTHE MUSIC - The People EP\nSingles\nRoundup\nKOSHEEN - Hungry\nSome of the drum 'n' bass hard heads out there who particularly enjoyed Kosheen's Hide U might find this a bit tame for\ntheir liking. On the other hand, if you prefer beats which haven't come out of the jungle, this may well tickle your fancy. With\nacoustic guitars, inoffensive beats and a vaguely Corrs-like\nvocal, Hungry is about as hard as a walnut whip, but it's short,\nsweet and perfectly nice.\nDerek\nBILAL - Fast Lane\nThis is fun. Bilal's scatting falsetto swoops over a funky Dre\nproduction, with Jadakiss along for the ride providing an enjoyable cameo. Bilal sounds like a young Prince, with, bizarrely,\nsomething of a Jeff Buckley feel, which is of course a Very Good\nThing\u2122.\nToby G HAVEN - Til The End\nThis is one of the softer songs from the album, gradually\nbuilding up momentum as it reaches the chorus. Gary Briggs'\nheartfelt vocals work very well with the guitars. Unfortunately\nthough, it sounds a bit too much like Coldplay.\nTank\nHOOBASTANK - Crawling In The Dark\nHoobastank are yet another Californian nu-metal band to be\nlaunched this side of the pond, but with one difference: they are\nactually quite good. They manage to get the mix right between\nrock noise and noticeable lyrics, and (whisper it!) they actually\nsing, rather than shouting or rapping over loud guitars. The harmonies are clear, even when they're rocking out. Let's hope that\nthere's a lot more to come.\nNick Tank\n\n"

    "content": "club active\nYacht Club Misadventures\nIt all got off to a bad start. It\nwas the weekend of the yacht\nclubs annual mad dash across\nto Cherbourg and back again.\nThe plan was to leave\nLondon early Friday afternoon,\nleave Portsmouth around nine\nthat evening, get to Cherbourg\nfor a late breakfast on Saturday,\ngo to the hypermarket and pub\nand then leave on Saturday\nevening to be back in Portsmouth on Sunday after-noon. Sadly this was not to be.\nWhat with leaving London over\nan hour late, the mini bus\nbreaking down and not buying\nquick cook pasta for dinner we didn't leave until midnight.\nHaving left the lights of\nPortsmouth Harbour behind\nwe found that the wind was not in a direction suitable for\njust pointing at France and hoping we got there, and a more zigzagged approach was\nrec rui red. We started on a westerly\ntack and stormed along at\nabout seven knots for a few\nhours, three of the ten crew on\nwatch and the others fast\nasleep, apart from the skipper\nwho had chosen to sleep next\nto the chocolate and was therefore frequently disturbed by\nmembers of the watch. Three\nhours later the first watch went\nto bed and the next took over.\nUnfortunately at some point in\nthe next three hours the wind\nalso decided to change and it\nbecame clear that we wouldn't get to Cherbourg until dinner\ntime on Saturday, which would\nleave us with only a couple of\nhours there before the long trip\nhome. It was therefore decided\nat a very sleepy six in the\nmorning that we wouldn't bother, and instead we continued on our circumnavigation of\nthe Isle of Wight, heading for\nPoole which we reached nine\nhours and a fine cooked breakfast later.\nWe stayed in Poole just long\nenough to shower and go to\nthe pub, and then headed for\nalong the coast to Lymington.\nThe trip out of Poole harbour\nwas an exciting hour of spotting flashing lights and matching them to those on the chart,\na task somewhat complicated\nby a random cardinal buoy, and\nthe difficulty of dist mg^ shing\nbetween a light flashing every\nfour seconds and one that\nflashed every five.\nWe arrived in Lymington at\nhalf past midnight, with the\nintention of leaving again at 5\nam, however, for reasons that\nare unclear, this didn't happen.\nInstead we left at half past\neight and went the short way along the coast, reaching\nrecord speeds of over ten knots\nand finding ourselves outside\nPortsmouth Harbour very much\nahead of schedule for the first\ntime all weekend. So we found\nourselves a quiet spot and threw a buoy called John overboard until he was rescued\nafter spending hours in the\nfreezing water and losing both\nlegs. We then headed to the\nIsle of Wight for lunch and a quick drink before heading\nback to Portsmouth to hand\nback the boat, having had a fantastic weekends sailing\neven if everything hadn't gone\nto plan....\nIn slightly more serious\nYachting news, over the final\nweekend of last term a Yacht\nClub crew, out to prove that\nthey weren't quite as incompetent as the first half of this\narticle suggests, enjoyed an\neventful two days of one-design racing in the Solent.\nThe company organising the\nregatta has recently purchased a fleet of brand new Sunfast 37s and so we had the\npleasure of racing a boat that\nhad only been sailed once\nbefore.\nConditions for the weekend\nwere forecast to be excellent\nfor racing with calm seas,\ngood visibility and moderate\nwinds. Despite the fine\nweather and the new boat we soon encountered a problem.\nDuring a downwind run shortly before the start of the race a shackle broke, dumping our\nspinnaker in the water and\nsending its halyard to the top\nof the mast. Quickly we recovered the sail from the sea and\nhoisted a willing volunteer up\nthe mast to retrieve the hal-yard, completing the task in time for the start. After a reasonable start we worked our\nway up the fleet of 23 other\nyachts and, despite a close\nencounter with the London\nBusiness School boat, finished\na respectable 11th. Following\na long lunch break, for repairs\nto be made to other yachts,\nthe second race went ahead\nwith no problems and we finished 10th. Encouraged by the\ndays performance we returned to Portsmouth and hurried to the pub for food and\nbeer.\nSunday's weather was better still, as was our perform-ance. During the first race of\nthe day some superb teamwork and crafty tactics meant\nwe crossed the line in a very\npleasing 6th position. With\nthis encouragement the final\nrace of the weekend started\nsuperbly putting us in the top\nfive for most of the race.\nUnfortunately as the saying\ngoes it isn't finished until the\nfat lady sings and the saying\ncouldn't be truer for sailing\nand we finished the race in7 th position.\nImperial College\nrr S.'3~K: T.m' tri JO^.

We are\na Union that takes part, that\nhas debate, that is political\n(small \"p\") if you will. This can\nonly bode well for the future.\nSecondly, I would like to\nrespond to a few of the letters\nyour paper received. It was always my intention to invite\nnon-Imperial people to this\ndebate, and I make no qualms\nabout it. The campaign of the\n\"Yes\" team was always one of\neducation. The students I spoke to knew nothing about\nthe NUS. They had many many\nquestions regarding the\nNational Union, including\n\"Why is it that every other\nUniversity in the country bar\none is a member, even though\nthey all hold referendums\nevery 3 years?\", \"What are the\nbenefits\" and a whole stack\nalong the lines of \"Is it true\nthat...\" The only way these\nquestions could be answered\nwas through experience.\nExperience of dealing with the\nNUS. Hence I invited people\nwho were a) London-centric\nand b) experienced in dealing\nwith the National Union.\nPeople who attended included\nthe UL U President, UL U Vice\nPresidents', a large proportion\nof the UL U Exec as well as officers from Kings College, UCL and Thames Valley. The feedback obtained from those students who actually stopped to\nspeak to these people was very positive. If I was to re-run\nthe campaign, I would do\nexactly the same thing again,\nas I believe it to be in the best\ninterests of the students here.\nThirdly, I would like to thank\nall those that took part in the\n\"Yes\" campaign. Much fun was\nhad, talking to people, rebuffing lies, designing websites\n(www.nus at imperial. co.uk).\nFrom what I can gather, there\nare still a lot of people asking\nquestions. Asking what ICU does for them. Asking how much of the \u00a3900,000 a year\nthey see of the money that\nCollege gives ICU. Asking why they don't get discounts.\nAsking when the next referendum will be. To those people, I urge you to keep asking. Ask until you get an answer that\nyou're happy with; not one\nthat will rob you of a vote for\nanother seven years.\nThanks,\nDavid Francis,\nChairman, Campaign for Reaffiliation to the NUS\nThe Nays have it\nSir\nWhat part of 'No' does David\nFrancis not understand?\n(Imperial rejects NUS, 20\nMarch 2002).\nYours etc.,\nAndy Heeps,\nChairman, The NUS 'No' campaign\nLetters aren't usually edited\nfor spelling and grammar, but\noften for length - keeping them\nto the style of Mr Heeps' contribution certainly helps.

They have no right to\nbe here, the referendum\nshould be for students to\ndecide upon for themselves,\nwithout external influence by\npeople who have nothing to do\nwith College. They have also\nbeen telling people that beer\nwill be cheaper if we join the\nNUS. If the reports in Felix are\ntrue (saying that beer will go\nup in price by 10-15p per pint\nwith the NUS), then they\nappear to be spreading lies.\nOn top of this, they seem to be\nquite offensive little self-important people, who don't actually have any answers to\nquestions such as what the\nNUS has ever achieved.\nUnfortunately, it is too late to\ndo anything about them, but\nhopefully, no one has listened\nto the yellow shirted prat s and\ntheir little bits of yellow paper.\nSid, Aero\nJust to be clear, Felix did not\nsay that beer prices would definitely go up - we merely compared prices with another\nUniversity of London bar,\nwhere beer was more ex pen sive.

    "content": "talk 7e//x The Colossus' at Thorpe Par\nJohn Clifford encounters the worlds only\nten loop rollercoaster, as well as the\nworld's most ominous queue\nPinned to my chair, I could see the surreal calm of Staines laid out in front of me,\ndrifting placidly over trees and steeples.\nSuddenly breathing became an effort, as\nclouds and grass all blurred into one and\nshot past me at a terrifying speed, turning my head into my feet and my spare\nchange into a memory. I had another 9 of\nthese to go, and I couldn't wait.\nWhilst taking advantage of the free bar,\na terrifying thought occurred to me. With\nalbums, gigs, plays and such, it's easy(ish). But what do you say about a rollercoaster? Cute girl from another student newspaper suggested filing the six\nwords \"It had its ups and downs\" before\ngetting drunk. But, I explained, this is\nFelix, and whilst you might not have anything useful to say, the primary rule is to\nbe drastically verbose and to employ generously a multitude of synonyms where a singular might notwithstanding suffice.\nRemembering I wanted Will to print\nthis, I headed off to the main event, and\nprepared to be amazed. There's no doubt\nabout it, Colossus is an intense experience and at only fifty seconds, if you blink\nyou'll miss it. Once I'd retrieved my contact lens from my neighbour's forehead it\nwas time to experience it a second time,\nin order to analyse the experience fully\nand give a balanced review. Actually it\nwas far too much fun to only go on once.\nBy the third ride, I'd concluded that the\nfirst half of the ride is fantastic. You don't even have a chance to work out where\nyou are as you hurtle past passers-by,\ndive underground, resurface and loop\nagain. Around the fifth loop we're treated\nto the surreal sight of a bored looking ride\noperator in a warm, calm room narrowly\nshooting past our heads at fifty miles an\nhour. The corkscrew bit, which takes up\nthe last fifty seconds, consists of being\nturned upside down four times in a row,\nwhich to a speed freak like me isn't quite\nas exciting.\nYou see, for all the looping and the\nscreaming, it's surprisingly short. Even\ngoing round twice would make it a bit\nmore of an experience, which was fine for\nme as I didn't have to queue (and had got\nin free). Riding that coaster 3 times in a row was the most fun I 've had in a while.\nBut if I'd paid to queue for up to an hour\n(and the queuing provision was certainly\ngenerous) for a single, 50 second ride, I'd be very disappointed. So while Thorpe\nPark have certainly put a lot of effort into\ndesigning an expensive and impressive\nride, coming up with a name with ten\nloops (COLOSSUS count them if you\ndon't believe me), and dazzling the press\nfor an evening, like most theme parks\nthey haven't really thought about the\nexperience, which will involve a minute\nstanding in a distraction less queue for\nevery second spent on the coaster, which\nisn't good enough for the fleeting attention span of the average TV viewer.\nSee www.thorpe park. com for more.\nAdmission: \u00a317-23 depending on demand.\nMcKinsey&Company\n\n"

    "content": "Michael Connelly always wanted to be a crime fiction writer\nafter reading the works of Raymond Chandler while attending\nthe University of Florida. Once he decided on this career path\nhe majored in journalism and when he graduated in 1980,\nMichael worked at newspapers in Daytona Beach and Fort\nLauderdale, Florida, primarily specialising in the crime beat.\nIn 1986 he and two other reporters wrote a magazine story\non an aeroplane crash and the survivors that was later shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize. Michael then moved to the Los\nAngeles Times as a crime reporter. After three years in LA,\nMichael started to write The Black Echo, a novel featuring\nLAPD detective Hieronymus Bosch. Since then Michael has\nwritten a further ten novels, seven of which feature Harry.\nThese works are reviewed below and an interview with\nMichael appears on the next page.\nMichael Connelly Novels\nPublished by Orion\nIn 1992 Michael Connelly wrote his first novel, The Black Echo,\nwhich later went on to win the Edgar Prize for Best First\nMystery Novel. The Black Echo introduced us to LAPD detective Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch and saw him investigating the\ndeath of Billy Meadows, a former colleague of Harry's during\nthe Vietnam war whose body was found in a drain pipe at the\nMulholland Dam. From the beginning Harry was very much a maverick whose conflicts with his Lieutenant and the hierarchy of the LAPD would constantly see him in trouble but apart\nfrom this Harry was regarded as a first-class detective. Instant\nsuccess with The Black Echo was followed with the next three\nBosch novels The Black Ice (1993), The Concrete Blond (1994)\nand The Last Coyote (1995). The Last Coyote being one of my\nfavourites (and also Michael's) in which Harry deals with his\nsuspension from the LAPD by re-opening a thirty-year-old\nunsolved crime: the murder of his own mother.\nIn 1996 Michael wrote the stand alone novel The Poet which\nconcerned crime reporter Jack McEvoy and the death of his\nbrother, a homicide detective. Jack finds that the best way to\ndeal with the death of his brother is to investigate and write an\narticle on suicides in the police force. When he begins his\nresearch he soon makes the shocking discovery that maybe not\nall of these officers committed suicide.\nIn 1997 saw the release of the next Bosch novel, Trunk Music,\nand in 1998 came the novel Blood Work. In Blood Work,\nConnelly introduces, Terry McCaleb, a former FBI agent whose\nheart ailment forced his early retirement. When Graciela Rivers\nasks him to investigate her sister's death, her story hooks him\nimmediately: the new heart beating in McCaleb's chest was\nhers. In 1999, Angels Flight (Bosch) was released and in 2000,\nVoid Moon hit the shops. Void Moon features Cassie Black a former burglar who would rob wealth gamblers in Las Vegas finds\nherself returning to Vegas for one last job. In 2001 saw a Terry\nMcCaleb and Harry Bosch novel, A Darkness More Than Night,\nin which Terry investigates a murder and finds that Harry\nBosch is the prime suspect. April 2002 saw the release of City\nOf Bones, the latest Bosch novel and a full review appears on\nthe next page. \u2022\nbook reviews\nCity of Bones\nOrion, Hardback, \u00a317.99\nOn the first day of the New Year, Detective Hieronymus (Harry)\nBosch is called out when a man reports that his dog has\nunearthed a number of bones in the Hollywood Hills. The dog's owner, a retired doctor, informs Harry that the bones are human\nand it is soon determined that they are the twenty years old\nremains of a twelve-year-old boy. Harry is drawn into a case\nthat evo cates memories of his own past and for him this is one\ncase that he is determined to solve.\nMost crimes that have gone undetected for twenty years\nnever get solved but Harry is confident that he will bring this\nkiller to justice and after much detective work he discovers the\nchild's identity and the background to his turbulent life.\nAt the same time as the case is unfolding, Harry starts an\naffair with a rookie female officer, Julia Brasher. After being\nemotionally hurt when his wife, Eleanor, suddenly left him,\nHarry is once again starting to open up to someone.\nWhen a supposedly straight forward meeting with a former\nfriend of the murdered boy goes hideously wrong Bosch begins\nto doubt his beliefs in both his actions and the job he holds. As\nthe investigation heads towards its startling conclusion Harry\nis on the verge of an almost unimaginable decision.\nWith the Harry Bosch novels, Michael Connelly created one of\nthe greatest crime fiction series of the nineties. With City of\nBones (and last years A Darkness More Than Night) this belief\ncan be carried into another decade as well. Michael is one of\nthose rare writers that manages to never write a bad book. His\ndescription and feel for Los Angeles is haunting and the dialogue that his characters purvey is realistic and never over the\ntop. The plot to this and all his novels show a mind that is both\nmethodical and he is constantly asking his reader to think about\nthe images that his work portrays.\nAs the Bosch series continues we've been witness to both the\nhighs and lows in Harry's life and this is one thing that keeps\nfans returning to these works. With everything that happens in\nCity Of Bones, Harry has some big decisions to make about his\nfuture and if Michael Connelly writes (and I'm sure he will) more\nbooks of this standard there will be a lot more people following\nHarry too.\n\n"

    "content": "reviews book\nMichael Connelly Interview\nFirst of all, can you tell us about your background and what\nyou did before you became a crime fiction writer?\nI was born in Philadelphia but I say I'm from Florida because\nmy family moved there when I was small and that's where I grew up. For the last fifteen years I 've lived in LA although\nrecently I moved back to a part of Florida where my wife is from\nand we'll probably move again in a couple of years. I moved a lot\nin Los Angeles, seven times in fifteen years but it seems to be in\nmy blood and it kind of helps me with my writing and I find it\ninvigorating.\nI decided in school that I wanted to be a writer and hopefully\nwrite some crime novels but I knew that at that point in my life\nit seemed a long shot so I went to journalism school and hoped\nthat that would be a means to an end. When I left school I became a police reporter and after a number of years of doing\nthis I started to write books and for a while the two over-lapped.\nThese days I'm no longer a journalist but it seems that I 've been\nwriting in some form my entire adult life.\nHow do you go about writing a novel?\nIt has changed a lot over the years but in general and definitely more recently I do a lot of thinking before I even start to sit\ndown at the computer to start writing. For me the thinking and\nplanning is the best part of writing as it can get you really excited and then you have to sit down and start writing it which is\nless so. In general I know the beginning and the end of a novel\nand the three hundred pages in between I make up as I go. It's hard to have the beginning and the end planned without having\nsome idea of how the middle will shape out, for example, I might\nknow what clue will put the detective on the right track so I'm not totally in the blind when I get to the middle.\nIn your first novel, The Black Echo, you introduce us to\nLAPD detective Harry Bosch. How did you come up with the\ncharacter of Harry?\nHe is definitely an amalgamation of many different things and\npeople. Real cops that I know or knew, fictitious cops from books\nand movies. The aspects of his personality even come from other\nwriters such as James Ellroy who has a similar background to\nhim. At the time of putting Harry together Ellroy was getting a name for himself and it was clear to me that this guy was working out whatever baggage the murder of his mother had left with\nhim by writing mystery novels. I thought then about a detective\nwho has the same sort of baggage but works it out by solving\ncrimes. Harry really does come from all over.\nHow has Harry Bosch changed over the years?\nI think that he has become gentler and more inward thinking\nand assessing of stuff he did. In Black Echo he was too stuffy, too\nmuch of an unyielding tough guy. By the time he got to Angels\nFlight he had learned more about the world and realised that\nthere is more grey in the world than black and white. In City of\nBones we come to an ultimate evolution I think with him, he is\ncoming to a realisation that he may have been using the wrong\nfuel in his engine. For a long time, Harry held to the belief that\nhe needed the badge to go out and conduct the mission which\nin his mind is solving murders to make up for the big one that\nchanged his life. There is nothing wrong with this mission or\nthat it is still intact in Harry's mind, but he sees another way of\ngoing at it now.\nSo what is City Of Bones about?\nI think it is about that on a character level. It is about him coming to a conclusion that it is time to turn his life in a different\ndirection and not lose the emotional mission in his life. I'm lucky\nbecause I write from a big picture view so I know what I'm going\nto do next. I think this is a story about a guy coming to some conclusions and changing his life and that is the very subtle part of\nwhat is pinned to the mystery that he is investigating. The part\nabout the bones is something that I 've wanted to write about for\nsome time. I came across some academic literature on anthropology and child abuse and it was something that I wanted to\nwrite about. The challenge was to get Harry emotionally\ncharged with a victim were there is no victim just bones. There\nis no flesh and blood he can look at to get him angry to find the\nkiller. That is why there is a pretty tough scene in the coroner's office when the doctor is going over the injuries with Harry and\nit gets to him because it could have been him. He was a thrown\naway child so there is a connection between Harry and the boy.\nWhat is going to happen to Harry?\nHe is definitely coming back. I 've just finished a stand-alone\nnovel and I'm getting back into Bosch. Basically, I 've rocked his\nworld like I 've rocked mine with moving three thousand miles.\nThe next Bosch is written in the first person and he is not a private detective but he is going to get involved with solving those\ncold cases he walked out of the door with. He will get a private\ndetective license about a month after he retires because it is a routine for cops in California to do so once they retire. Harry does\nthis, and what I 've written so far, is it's now eight or nine month\nafter he retired and he is opening those boxes and looking\ninside. My aim is to write two books with him on his own and\nthen I'm going to have him join the newly formed homicide\nsquad that is being set in LA to solve cold cases that is going to\nbe run by talented, retired detectives. My goal is to write two\nHarry's in private and then bring him back into a bureaucratic\nsetting because he is interesting to watch in this way.\nJonathan\n\n"

I can tell you that last\nyear was a distressingly NonPolitically Correct affair, with\ndifferent divisions for each sex.\nOf course that kind of old fashioned out-mode d thinking was\nright out at this year's event,\nand the foolish complaints of\nmany that 'Girls aren't as\nstrong as boys' was bitterly\nignored, and quite rightly so.\nThis sport isn't about mere\nstrength: this is a game that\ncan be played on a mental level\nas well as utilising speed,\ncourage, and a vicious desire to\nexpose your enemy's genitals..\nThe rules are complex, and\ncan't be explained in detail\nhere, but it's fair to say that the\nfirst person who finds themselves butt-naked up to their\nneck in mud lost. Imagine, if\nyou will, a love child of rugby,\nwrestling and strip poker.\nA Personal Plea\nAs you may have noticed by\nthis point, the sports section\nthis week consists solely two\narticles concerning yachting. I know that this will seem less\nthan fair to some of you, but I would like to point out - so I don't get too much abuse from\nthose of you who are not fans\nof the nautical arts - that there\nwas nothing else to publish.\nThis is not a complaint\ndirected at the ICYS, to whom\nI am indeed most grateful, but\nat the rest of you bastards\nwho didn't send us anything\nat all. I know that the summer\nterm is a busy and stressful\ntime for us all but it's also a time for some of the finer\npleasures in life: cricket, and,\ner, swimming, and all that\nkind of stuff.\nSo get out there and play\nfrisbee, you lovely people. Get\nout there, enjoy the sun, and\nthen come back and write me\nsome 'we're enjoying the sun'\nreports, and I can have a whole new section that entirely relates your lazy afternoons\nsat in the park with your\nfriends rather than revising.\nWhich is great. Let me repeat\nmyself once more: there's more to life than a degree, you\nknow. Like sunburn.\nSo as this, possibly the\nweirdest issue of Felix ever\npublished, draws to an end, it\nmerely remains for me to fill\nup the rather large empty half-page above my head. To do\nthis, I 'll tell you about my\nenjoyable time at a certain\nrapidly growing sport's finals.\nSuffice to say I won't mention the bizarre incident with\nthe goat, the lightning and the\nsmall kitchen utensil used for\ncrushing garlic, but the goat is\nhappily living in Brighton with\nthe utensil, and I'm off to have\na nervous breakdown.\nThis year's first bout (sorry,\nbut I just can't resist this) was\nbetween Doug 'Pretty Filthy,\nReally' Williams (seeded 4) and\nMary 'Slightly Soiled' Dane (6),\nwhich passed relatively\nuneventfully, apart from some\nslightly suspect play from Mary\nthat seemed to suggest a swift\nkick between Doug's legs.\nHowever, never one to give up,\nhe came back to eventually pin\nher down and claim victory.\nThe next three first round\nmatches all went as expected,\nwith the higher seeds all winning their matches. This led to\nDoug 'Really Quite Filthy, Now'\nWilliams (4) being up against\nAli 'Nasty Mucky Threesome'\nTehran (3), and current champion Penny 'Dirty Filthy Dirty\nDirty Little Vixen' Monsoon (1)\nwas to play Fryn 'Could Be\nMuch Dirtier, But Is\nNonetheless Pretty Manky'\nFarrer (5).\nAfter much to-ing and fro-ing, Fryn beat Penny using a surprise headlock, and went on\nto face Ali, who had overcome\nDoug using his patent 'Four\nFooter' Manoeuvre.\nThis final match lasted several hours, and both players\nlooked like they enjoyed every\nmoment, but all good things\nmust eventually climax, and\nonce the mire had cleared, it\nwas found that Ali was up to\nhis neck in it, leaving Fryn 'We\nKnew She Had It In Her To Be A Really Really Dirty Little\nDeviant' Farrer as the winner.\nRest assured: I will keep you\ninformed of future games...\nimperial Presents mJ| A JHBB1IA\n'..college \u201e ve sport | | Q5C RE ENS union\nBARS\non the\ni Ik )\ni A J Saturday27 th April Spurs v Liverpool 12pm Ipswich v Man Utd 5.35pm \u2022' imperial\n* \u2022 \u2022 college\nunion\nCHARINOCKOSS BAR\ne^l We d.1st May f Ik \"\nJ!

    "content": "this week\nEditorial\nWell, boys and girls. What an\neventful time it's been for your\nfriendly neighbourhood editor.\nWould you like a full rundown\non the happy events that have\nled to my mental downfall? Of\ncourse you wouldn't, but as\nusual, I have nothing better to\nwrite about, and I 've felt less\nbitter in the past, and quite\nfrankly, what's the point of\nediting a student newspaper\nif you can't exploit it in such a way as to perform self an aly sis, and achieve some kind of\ncathartic closure, resulting\nfinally in issue resolution and\na positive personality out-come? Eh?\nSo, first you may have\nnoticed that Felix is tiny. This,\nI'm afraid, will probably be an\nongoing problem throughout\nthe rest of this term, since we have no money. I have been\nreliably informed that this is\ndue to the tragic events of\nSeptember 11th, which has\nled to a record low in graduate\nrecruitment, and thus the\nadvertising on which I depend that funds this august\norgan. Basically we're out of\ncash, so I'm cutting back.\nNot to mention the fact that\nnobody ever wants to help\nduring the summer term, due\neither to exam revision,\nexams, or the fact that they've\nfinished their exams and are\ntherefore sitting in a hole\nsomewhere, surrounded by their own excrement and evidence of a significant amount\nof drug abuse. Which is\nalways my favourite option.\nTo be honest, given half a chance, I wouldn't be here\neither, but then I'm paid, so I suppose I should do something to justify that.\nSo that's one thing. The\nnext thing I have to talk about\nis more personal, but then I 've\nnever been one to shirk from\nexposing myself in public\n(giggle). You see the problem\nis holidays. I made the foolish\nerror of going away for a whole eight days, and I have\nnow learned that that is significantly longer than the\nattention span of certain people who shall remain nameless because while I'm bitter\nI'm not a complete bastard.\nWell I am, but not like that.\nAnyway the upshot is that\nwhen I went away I was happy and had a girlfriend,\nand when I returned I was\nunhappy and did not. This\ndoesn't sound too complex,\nbut it wasn't actually my girlfriend who had the short\nattention span, she was merely the unfortunate injury in an\nemotional crossfire I couldn't keep together. (Sorry.)\nSo that's a fairly cryptic ref-e rence, and I realise that you\nall think I'm probably very\nsilly, but you wouldn't believe\nhow relieving it is to publicly\nair your sorrows. I hope I haven't made myself out to be\nsome unfortunate soul who\nhas been trampled on,\nbecause that's not true. I suspect I deserve everything I get, but I'm still allowed to\nfeel sorry for myself, so raspberries to you.\nAnyway, on a more cheerful\nnote, it's summer, so at last I can go out and look like a tit\ntrying to play frisbee, not to\nmention wandering around\nsubtly enjoying the lovely\nskirts that people (girls, usu-ally) start to wear this time of\nyear. And I don't have to do\nnasty things like exams, so\nthat's a bonus too.\nGood luck, however, to all of\nyou who are sitting them this\nterm. However, as I 've said\nbefore, you're going to work\nfor the rest of your life, but\nyou're only a student once.\nThis\nWeek\nFriday Weekend\nUnion\nEvents\nDolly Mixtures\nOoh err.

    "content": "back talk\ngrad and you don't get much\npublishable mail.\nOh, and why have you\nstopped sending Felix to\nHammersmith? It's one of the\nfew good things to read\naround here.\nI'd like to say that the election,\nand referendum, were a farce.\nI was not sent an e mail telling\nme of the referendum, like I heard other students were,\ntherefore I didn't get to\nappoint a proxy in time, as the\ntimes of proxy allocation were\nnot communicated to me and\ntherefore didn't vote in either.\nBit crap really.\nSo, the issues are:\nWhy do medics only have one\nballot box? Who decided this?\nWhy is there a serious communication problem with getting\ninfo to students located at\ncampuses other than South\nKen? Who should pay for this?\nI know that it is too late for the\nelection, or referendum to be\nre-run (I am personally quite\nhappy with the result thank\nyou) - but for next year, something should be done about\nthis.\nNed Laver\nWe're glad you liked the Easter\nEgg review. As for deliveries of\nFelix to Hammersmith, we do\nsend copies on Friday every\nweek, so they should arrive by\nMonday. If they appear to be\ngoing astray, we shall certainly\nfollow it up. AW\nHi Will,\nNow I'm no political expert,\nand I'm writing on Thursday\nmorning, when the polls have\njust opened, so I 've no substantial evidence to go on,\nonly my judgement. But I'd like\nto raise a point: What does it\nsay about the state of our\nUnion, and the IC student\nbody in general when we\nstruggle to have a10% turnout\nfor an election, but we flock to\nthe polls to vote on the\nNUS??? Having spoken to people and o bse ved the queues at\nthe ballot boxes, I'm expecting\na previously unheard-of ridiculously high turnout for this\nvote by IC standards. The reason - people actually care and\nwant to express an opinion.\nBe it student discounts or club\nfunding (seemingly the only\narguments for and against) we\nhave a view.\nSo why don't we care about\nwho doles out the funding??\nI'd hazard its because we don't notice any changes from one\nyear to another, we don't know the candidates (so who\nknows what job they will do)\nand so none of us care.\nIs every Uni as apathetic as\nwe are? Why do we care so\nmuch about a card? And why\ncouldn't the s a bbs sort out\ntwo votes on the same day?\nAnswers on a postcard..?\nLibby Jackson\nPhysics 3\nSobering thought\nDear Felix,\nWe thought it was important\nthat our customers read the\nfollowing letter from the\nMetropolitan Police.\nYours,\nMick (Union Bars Manager)\nThe purpose of this letter is to\ninform you of the Metropolitan\nPolice strategy towards dealing with drunkenness in and\naround licensed premises in\nWestminster.\nThere are Government statistics to show that there is a significant correlation between\npersons who are drunk and\ngon on to commit crime or\nbecome victims of crime.\nThe city of Westminster is one\nof the most popular areas for\nvisitors and for Londoners to\nenjoy a night out. However it\nmust be acknowledged that\npeople do get drunk and cause\nproblems for residents and\nother visitors to the area.\nThe Licensing Act 1964 makes\nit quite clear that permitting\ndrunkenness, serving a drunk,\nor allowing a drunk to remain\non licensed premises is an\noffence.\nWith these points in mind it is\nfelt that positive action needs\nto be taken to deal with drunkenness and the issues arising\nfrom drunkenness. As such\nthe Metropolitan Police in conjunction with the Portman\nGroup and the British Institute\nof Innkeepers intend to launch\nan anti drunkenness strategy.\nThe purpose of this partnership is to provide awareness\nfor drinkers, a proactive police\nenforcement regime, and an\neducation programme for\nlicensees and their staff. We\nfeel that this holistic approach\nis the most appropriate\nmethod for dealing with a burgeoning problem in London.\nWithin the next few weeks\nthere will be a police enforcement programme aimed at\ndealing with drunkenness in\nlicensed premises.\nWe hope that you will join us\nin tackling the problem of\ndrunkenness and making\nWestminster a safer and more\nenjoyable environment for its\nresidents and visitors.\nYours faithfully,\nChristopher Bradford\nChief Inspector\nH1U rg\nX fill /ort/ of your\nfavourite music\n^ Eye ru f rid duc) Bs Bar open/ ol8 pm Barbeque from 10pm Tree before 9pml.50/ \u00a3 2 guests after 9pm/) Friday Night Out * , .\n^ Supported by * impeNd l college\n\n"
