In addition, whole groups\nof instruments have been out fo\norder.\nOf the 38 outside lines serving\nthe College, 23 were out of action\nwhen the system became fully\noperational on 15 September.\nThis led to long delays in\nanswering incoming calls.\nMany users have also experienced difficulty with their new\ntelephone instruments. In many\ncases British Telecom, who installed the system, gave phones the\nwrong category, preventing au th Pictured above is the computer in the telephone exchange which records\ninformation about each call made, and acts as a directory for the\nswitchboard staff when connecting outside callers.\nCareering\nAlong\nThoughts for Finalists\nThere are about 155 term days until you cease to be a final year\nstudent at Imperial College and start to be a well what? It\nmay seem premature to start thinking about your future now,\nbut those 155 days will zoom past and before you know it you\nmight be sitting in my office saying, 'I wish I'd started earlier, I 've\nmissed two closing dates already and it's hard to make a decision so quickly.'\nThe Careers Advisory Service is here to help you avoid last\nminute 'panic buys'. For the totally clueless, 'I haven't the\nfaintest idea what I want to do, or when to start' we run two\nseminars on Wednesday afternoons entitled, inspiring ly, 'Career Choice A and B'.( You have to book for these so check\nyour notice board for details). Throughout the Autumn Term\nspeakers from a whole range of organisations will give lectures\nabout general areas of employment like management, scientific\njournalism, design and development etc.\nIf you feel the need of a personal interview with a Careers\nAdviser, you have to book one in advance but, if you just have a quick query, one of us will be available in the Careers Library\n(Room 311, Sherfield Building) between 4.30pm and 5.30pm Monday to Friday.\nOh and by the way, if you think you might want to teach, join\nthe fast stream of the Civil Service or study abroad, you should\napply early in October.\nAnnie Martin\nCareers Adviser\nor is ed users from obtaining\noutside lines. Other phones have\ngone completely dead as engineers have made adjustments to\nthe wiring.\nSome users without a recall\nbutton fitted to their phones have\nbeen over-eager to try the new\nfacilities, and have found their\ncalls forwarded to a another\nextension with no way of cancelling it.\nPeter Burridge, in charge of the\nCollege telephones, said that the\nproblems stemmed from the fact\nthat the system was delivered five\nweeks late by BT. If it had been\non time, he went on, the teething\nproblems would have been sorted\nout well before the start of term.\nDeposits\nDeposits paid by residents in\nCollege Halls and Houses are to\nbe increased by up to five times, it\nwas decided at an emergency\nmeeting of the Student Residence\nCommittee (SRC) during the\nvacation. The new deposit of \u00a325\nwill be held against damage as\nwell as being a key deposit.\nLast year there was a deposit of\n\u00a35 in Halls of Residence and \u00a3 10\nin the Evelyn Gardens Houses,\nwhich was described as a key\ndeposit although there have been\ninstances of it being wit held for\nreasons other than loss of keys.\nThe special meeting of the SRC\nwas called by the Chairman, Dr\nDon Munro, on the insistence of\nStudent Services Officer Michael\nArthur who had decided that the\ndeposit should be raised to \u00a325 in\nboth Halls and Houses. In future,\nresidents who cause damage to\ntheir rooms or common areas or\nleave their rooms in an\nexcessively untidy state when\nthey leave, will have deductions\nmade from their deposits. The\nintroduction of the new deposit\nwas supported by Union president Ian Bull.\nAnother increased charge on\nresidence bills will be the\ninsurance premium, which as a result of the introduction of a new all-risks policy will go up\nfrom \u00a34.50 to \u00a39.50. The cover\nafforded by the new policy will,\nhowever, be much improved on\nlast year's insurance. Details of\nthe policy, which covers\nresidents' personal property, will\nbe circulated along with the first\nterm's rent bill.\nChoir romp home! Ex-FELIX Editor Martin S Taylor led 'The Choir Team' to victory in the\nannual FELIX Motor Club Rally on Sunday 24 June.\nSeven teams set off from the FELIX Office in vehicles ranging from\nJez, the RCS fire engine, to a humble mini. Their quest was to answer the\nseries of questions set by Pallab Ghosh and puzzles editor Ulysses, and to\ncollect various items of treasure from all over London. The rally took\nteams as far away as Greenwich.\nPoints were awarded for items of treasure and questions correctly\nanswered. The team that amassed the largest number of points is pictured\nabove, I to r, Martin S Taylor, Amanda Laurence, and Tony Moorby.\n24 Monday 1 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBSD\nAMNESTY\nStudent\nprisoner\nreleased\nImperia! College Amnesty group has been\ncampaigning since 1981 for the release of the\nBeninese student Firmin Awadon who, with\nother students, had been detained without\ncharge or trial since 1979, probably on\nsuspicion of participation in a strike at the\nnational university. In 1983 Amnesty\nInternational accepted an invitation from the\ngovernment of Benin to send a mission to the\ncountry to investigate abuses of human\nrights, but the government failed to answer\nfurther correspondence and the mission had\nto be abandoned. The authorities also failed\nto send a representative to the United\nNations in February 1984 to answer\nallegations made to the Commission on\nHuman Rights. However, several temporary\nimprovements were made in the prisons,\nperhaps in preparation for Amnesty's visit,\nand after many protests from the IC group\nand the prisoners themselves about the\nillegality of their detention an official order for\ntheir admin in strat ive internment was\nprepared(four years after the event) and\nshown to them.\nOn 1 August this year the presidential\noffice of Benin declared an amnesty for all\npolitical prisoners('except those who had\nparticipated in the ignoble and barbarous\nimperialist aggression of Sunday 16 January\n1977'), and Mr Awadon was released next\nday. He had been kept in a prison containing\nfour times the intended number of inmates,\nwhere several people died every month, with\nno food except that provided by relatives. He\nsuffered from head injuries received in a beating in 1980.\nThe group's action, performed in\ncollaboration with Amnesty groups in two\nother countries, consisted of sending\nhundreds of letters to the authorities and\nsome parcels to the prisoner, together with\nsome attempts at publicity and a consultation with the cultural attac he to the\nembassy of Benin in Paris. In December 1983\na petition was sent from the college to Benin\nand many members of staff wrote to the\npresident of the country.\nWe can only guess whether the group's activities contributed to Mr Awadon's release. The actions of the government\nduring the past year suggest that the\npresidential amnesty was prompted by\nsensitivity to campaigns and publicity about\nhuman rights generally. Mr Awadon wrote to\nthe group after his release: 'I shall keep up my\ncontacts with Amnesty through you, my\nfriends. As I always promised during my\ndetention, I shall commit myself with you to\nthe noble task of helping the voiceless\nthousands imprisoned purely for their\npolitical or religious convictions or their\nrace.'\nICCND\nThe Facts\nof...Life?\nFact: Eighty percent of Imperial College\nstudents would not survive a nuclear attack\non London.\nFact: Research into new and more deadly\nweapons takes place at Imperial College.\nFact: The Government intends to spend\n\u00a311 billion on a Trident nuclear missile'\nsystem at a time when education spending\nhas been cut to the bone.\nThe Facts of Life are revealed in full at\nICCND's stall in the Union Dining Hall at\ntomorrow's Freshers' Fair.

    "content": "SPORTH\nSport at IC\nNormally FELIX will offer a comprehensive results service and detailed reports\nof matches played by IC\nsports teams. In this first\nissue of term Sports Editor\nAndy Whitehead explains a bit about sport at Imperial.\nImperial College joined the\nUniversity Athletics Union\n(UAU) last year and finished up\nNational Champions in water\npolo and volleyball, and runners-up in six-a side cricket.\nU AU is a national union of\nuniversities organising competitions in numerous sports. In the\ninitial regional competition IC\ncompetes in the South West\ndivision. This means that all IC\nteams competing will play f Qur fixtures during the Autumn term,\nagainst other Universities i\" the\nSouth West region. The top two\nteams in the regional league go\non to the National Championships.\nThe University of London\nUnion (ULU) offers a wider\nrange of sports than that\navailable at Imperial. If your\nparticular sport is not catered for\nat IC then UL U may be able to\nhelp. In previous years UL U has\nalso offered a higher standard of\nsport, but now that IC has joined\nU AU the standard here is at least\nequivalent to that at UL U. If you are considering playing\nfor UL U, remember that in many\nsports you will not be able to play\nfor IC either because of club\npolicy or fixture clashes.\nSPORTS\nTRIALS\nWednesday 3 October\n\u2014Imperial College Sports Ground\u2014\nHarlington\nSee sports clubs at Freshers Fair on\nTuesday.\nMeet 12.30pm, Beit Arch for the trials on\nWednesday. Coaches will convey to\nHarlington.\nRecipe cf the \\flee k The British seem to be either potty or pig-ignorant about\nvegetables, and usually both. Even vegetarians seem to\nproduce lots of dishes called 'nut cutlet' or 'vegetable hot-pot.'\nMost meat eaters seem to think that half-a packet of frozen peas\nis a good enough accompaniment to the Sunday Roast.\nThe Indians are very good with vegetables, but there are also\nsome terrific European dishes. This one comes from Southern\nFrance. Aubergines (called eggplants in the States) are in\nseason now. Buy them from a Greek or Indian greengrocer\nwhere they're about half the supermarket price.\nThis dish tastes better with 8oz of fresh tomatoes, peeled, but\nfor simplicity use tinned.\nIngredients\n\u2022 a14 oz can tomatoes\n\u2022 2 aubergine s \u2022 bunch of spring onions\n\u2022 2 tablespoons olive oil\n\u2022 salt and pepper\nFELIX Monday 1 October 1984\nMethod\n1 Cut the stalks off the aubergine s, cut in half lengthways and\nscoop out the seeds and pulp.\n2 Drain the juice from the tomatoes and drink with a shot of\nsherry or vodka (cook's perk). Remove the coarse green stalk\nand the beard from the spring onions and chop into 3 or 4\npieces.\n3 Mix the aubergine pulp, tomatoes, onion and salt and\npepper and fry in 1 tablespoon of olive oil until the pulp begins\nto brown.\n4 Scoop the mixture into the aubergine shells. Wrap the\nbottom of the shells in foil smeared with the remaining olive oil.\n5 Bake at 375 degrees fahrenheit (gas mark five) for 35\nminutes.\nServes four\nNick Gillies\n17\n\n"

    "content": "EFELIX;\nFelix Photo File\nAmong the hordes of new faces to which you will be exposed\nin your first week at Imperial, there are a few that belong to\npeople who are more important (or think that they are more\nimportant) than the others. Here, then, is FELIX'S guide to\nsuch big-shots, big-heads and busy-bodies. (It's up to you to\ndecide which is which!)\nKEY\n1. Lord Brian Flowers,. Rector of Imperial College.\nThe Rector is academic and administrative head of\nthe College, and probably spoke to you at the\nFreshers' Reception. He was a Physics don at\nManchester. Brian is the SDP's spokesman on\nEducation in the House of Lords, and is Chairman of\nthe Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.\n2. Ian Bull, President of Imperial College Union. Like\nDeputy President and Hon Sec, Ian was elected last\nterm to represent us for 1984-85. Authoritarian,\nimpulsive, pig-headed and ugly, likes to show who's in charge. Fond of Guinness, and last year's president.\n3. Dave Parry, Deputy President of IC Union. Dave is\nin charge of finance, fixtures, furniture and fittings,\nand occasionally turns his hand to females, felony\nand photography. Fond of beer.\n4. Eric Da r by shire( with an 'a'), Honorary Secretary ol\niC Union. Eric takes care of insurance, transport and\noperating the toy printing machine in the Union\nOffice (when he remembers to put any paper in it).\nFond of beer.\n5. Lester Kershenbaum, Senior College Tutor. Lester\nhas recently taken over this job, but has been Senior\nTutor in Chemical Engineering for some time, so he\nknows what he's talking about.\n6. Sean Davis, UGM Chairman. Sean is Chairman of\nthe Union General Meeting (UGM), the sovereign\nbody of the Union. A UGM chairman requires a distinct voice and a clear style of delivery.\nUnfortunately Sean has neither of these, but he does\nhave a good knowledge of the Constitution.\n7. Kathy Tait, Union Receptionist. Kathy is the first\nline of defence in the Union Office. She is the one\nwho will help you, in the first instance, if you come to\nthe Union with a question. If she doesn't know the\nanswer then she'll almost certainly be able to find\nsomeone who does.\n8. Don Adlington, Student Counsellor. Don is the\nman to see if you have any problems. He is the\nstudent counsellor and his office is at 15 Princes\nGardens. The strictest confidence is guaranteed.\nMonday 1 October 1984\n\n"

    "content": "SINGLES\n45 rpm\nIn this regular column super-DJ Pete Coleman\nreviews the single releases of the week from his\nunrivalled position as head of IC Radio.\nAdam Ant: Apollo 9\nNo longer a teen idol,\nAdam's career is on a real\ndowner. However, in 'Apollo\n9,' he regains some of the\nenergy of 'Ant Music' and 'Dog\nEat Dog.' Producer, Tony\nVisconti, manages to make\nmeaningless lyrics and a one\nline tune seem really good.\nWatch out, this one is catchy.\nFreddie Mercury: Love Kills\nWhen I first heard this I had\nno idea who it was. For the\nfirst time recording outside\nQueen, Freddie Mercury has\nproduced this for Giorgio\nMoroder' s new album \"Metropolis.\" Bound to be a hit, but would it have been if\nnot for Queen? I'm not so\nsure.\nMusic From A Small Planet:\nLove Sacrifice\nTake an African Rhythm:\nstick a disco mix on it with\nplenty of synths: add steel\ndrums for extra flavour, and a wailing voice. Mix them all\ntogether and you get 'Love\nSacrifice.' Sounds awful? It is\nn't. The twelve Inch especially\nprovides an explosive contrast to some of the pop\npop in the charts. Get up and\nRhumba!!\nGeno Vess: Why Are You\nCrying?\nDerby band's debut release\nis a five track twelve Inch EP,\nfeaturing 'Why Are You Crying.' Lacks the together\nfeel you get used to on\ncommercial records, but more\nthan makes up for this with a biting Indie edge, and excellent keyboard work from\nJohn Crossley.\" Sounds\" describes them as a Jazz\nCrossover band. Since I don't know what that means, I 'll say\nthis is well worth giving a listen to.\nJohny Mathis: Simple\nPretty much what we've\ncome to expect from Mr\nMathis. Lots of Dum Do Wah's from the background vocalists, and not a lot more to\nlisten for in JM's lyrics. The\npress people at CBS tell me\nthis is the best thing for years.\nDon't be fooled. If you can\nstand more than two or three\nlistens to this, I despair of you.\nIan Page & Bop: Unity Street\nThis is good. Got my feet\ntapping within seconds. Good to see Ian enjoying his music\nagain instead of p ratting around with Secret Affair.\nVery hum mable tune; you can\nbe a pain to others for hours\nafterwards if you keep whistling it! Just try.\nReviews:\nFELIX will contain a varied\nselection of theatre, film, book\nand record reviews. Anyone\ninterested in writing reviews\nshould call in to the Office\nZZREVEWS3\nBode m Wooleny\nHello and welcome to a new\nconcept in FELIXjournalism\u2014a weekly column with items about\npeople and events in the Union\nand in College, giving an incisive\n(and often amusing) insight into\nthe personalities and stories\nbehind the news. It aims to\nprovide an independent commentary on important\nmatters, to highlight some of the\nmajor cock-ups in College, and\nto ridicule those incompetent\nenough to deserve it. In order not\nto compromise the author, an\nexperienced observer of College\nand Union affairs, he or she will\nremain anonymous, but the\ncolumnist can be contacted c/o The FELIX Office if you have\nany tip-offs concerning events\nyou feel deserve to be related to a wider audience.\nAn illuminating insight into\nthe workings of the Refectories\nsection was offered by the\nUnion's takeover of the refectory\nin the Union building. Shortly\nafter it closed for good under\nCollege management last term\nUnion Officers and Victor\nMooney, College Refectory\nManager, agreed that several\nitems of equipment would be left\nbehind for use in the new snack-bar. However, this gentlemen's agreement was apparently not to\nthe liking of Mr Mooney's deputy, Martin Parsons. As soon\nas Victor was off for a few days\non his yacht\" at Southampton\nParsons hurri d ly despatched a van to put a 'scorched earth'\npolicy into effect removing every\nlast nut and bolt from the place,\nand coating the floor with half an\ninch of grease in the process.\nEven the sink was unplumbed\nready for removal. When Victor\nreturned from his holiday he had\nto order that much of the\nequipment be returned. Union\nOfficers were treated to the sight\nof Parsons himself returning\nitems he had refused to leave in\nhis boss's absence. This incident\nfurther re-in forces the belief that\nwhoever replaces Mr Mooney on\nhis retirement next year it\nshouldn't be Martin Parsons\nPictured above are Geno Vess, the Derby band whose debut EP 'Why are you crying' is newly\nreleased.\nFELIX Monday 1 October 1984 21\n\n"

To\nsubject students, including first years,\noverseas students and those of a nervous\ndisposition innocently visiting the Union\nOffice to get their Union card, to the sight of\nthe External Affairs Officer dancing around\nfestooned with 'I love Red Ken' badges,\nstickers and balloons is enough to put them\noff ever coming near the Union building\nagain. No doubt they will also get the\nimpression that Union General Meetings will\nbe taken up with similar time-wasting issues\nof no direct relevance to students, and so not\nbother to turn up.\nYours sincerely\nJ Martin Taylor\nChem Eng PG\nHere we go again\nDear Sir,\nOn Monday 1st October at each of the\nFreshers' UG Msa motion will be proposed\nthat tries to encourage students to think\nabout the issue of equality in their Unions.\nThese motion, if not stopped by the Union\nPresidents, will probably be shouted down,\nor ridiculed.\nFreshers will soon discover that the\nCollege they have joined is full of political\nand philosophical apathy, that their student\nleaders lack initiative and any political drive.\nAt a College where nuclear weapons,\napartheid, sexism, pornography, animal\nrights, human nature are far more than just\ntheoretical ideas in an abstract argue ment. Where students are faced with these issues in\ntheir studies, research, future jobs and social\nlife we are told naively that this Union is non-political.\nOver this academic year there will be a campaign to change the attitudes of students\nat Imperial, to get them to apply their reason\nand thought outside their academic fields.\nWe do not aim to create a left-wing or a right-wing Union, we want it simply to be one\nthat is intellectually active and aware.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael P Newman\nSorry state\nDear Sir,\nDuring the last twelve months two serious\n(and potentially very dangerous) accidents\nhave occured within my department.\nThe first accident involved a cylinder head\non an oxygen cylinder releasing a jet of flame\nout of the back plate. The head was\neffectively destroyed and so as an in term measure the metal gas distribution manifold\nwas replaced by lengths of rubber tubing. It\nwas possible that the gas cylinder or its\ncontents were at fault and so the cylinder was\nkept in order that it could be sent away for\nanalysis. All this was ten months ago and the\nrubber tubing is still there\u2014as for the gas\ncylinder it stands in a corner gathering dust.\nIn the second accident, a glass vessel\nexploded with appreciable force whilst being\nworked on by a glass blower. I believe that\nwhen College officials were investigating the\nevent their whole attitude was blas e and,\nrather than leave the case open for further\ninvestigation, they preferred to laugh it off as\na joke saying that it seemed like they had a mystery.\nIf this is the attitude of College to incidents\ninvolving employees\u2014incidents where sight,\nhearing, even life itself could have been\nlost\u2014how would they react to ones involving\nstudents?\nI strongly suspect that double standards\nwould come into play and, bearing in mind\nthat students are second class citizens at IC, I shudder to think which way they would fall.\nFinally let me say that in no way is the\ndepartmental safety committee to blame for\nany of the above\u2014I believe that it is wholly\nthe indolence and attitude of certain Staff in\nSherfield that have caused this sorry state of\naffairs.\nYours sincerely,\nHugh Stiles\nChem Eng PG\nOptimism\nDear Sir,\nCongratulations on your first issue of\nterm!\nI hope that FELIX will differ this year from\nissues of previous years in that it will be frey\nfrom hypo crap h ical err ers. Yours s iii ince rely i Lancelot Wake\nChem Eng 3\nSpace filler\nDear Sir,\nIt has always been a source of interest to\nme as to how it is that the last letter in the\npage always takes up exactly the right\namount of\ncontinued page 94\nFELIX\nThe financial\nquestion\nIt would be reassuring if Ian Bull, Union\nPresident, were to make a categorical\nstatement at Thursday'sU GM that Clubs'\nand Societies' finances will not suffer as a result of an oversight by last year's sabbatical\nofficers.\nContrary to Union By-Law 6, (which states\n'the finance of the Union shall be administered by the Council which shall allocate\ngrants to the sub-Committees and authorise\nother Union expenditure') the financial\nestimates for this year, which should have\nbeen presented to last year's. Council in May,\nhave not been put forward. This is probably\ndue to an oversight by Christine Teller, last\nyear's Deputy President. Consequently the\nfinances of every Club and Society in the\nUnion are now in question. This reflects\nbadly on last year's sabbatical officers and\nlast year's Union Council.\nSuch an oversight is symptomatic of a disregard for proper financial procedures;\nsomething that the College will be quick to\npoint out and take advantage of when the\nUnion negotiates it's annual sub vent ion. If the President does not give such an\nassurance it can only be assumed that he is\nwilling to misuse his position as the most\nimportant man in the Union Office to oversee\nthe perpetration of financial mis demean ours which will work to the detriment of both\nUnion Clubs and Societies and the Union\u2014\nthat is to say us\u2014as a whole. '\nTo ignore this oversight in the hope that it\nwill go away would be an ostrich-like\nabdication of his Presdential position.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Tony\nthe printer, Rosemary the typesetter, J Martin Taylor, Hugh Stiles, Hugh Southey,\nDave Jones, Nick Maxwell, M Newman,\nDiane Love, Jon Burgess, Chris Hendy, Pat\nPocock, Ian Bull, Pallab Ghosh and Patrick\nColl.

    "content": "EPOSTGRADS~\nAlpha not\ngood enough\nA recent Science and Engineering\nResearch Council report entitled 'Support of\nResearch Grants' has highlighted the\nincreasing inability of the Council to fund all\nof its highest priority research projects.\nThe SER C is one of the quasi-governmental bodies responsible for funding\npostgraduates in the UK and it is the\nResearch Council that Imperial has most\ndealings with. Academics submit research\nproject proposals to the Council in the hope\nthat they will be accepted for funding. The\nCouncil grades the projects according to\ntheir likely contribution to the subject, their\nlong term industrial applicability and\nrelevance to in dust i al needs. Those projects\ngraded 'alpha' are the highest priority\nprojects and it is these which are suffering.\nFor the science board the number of\nun funded 'alpha' projects has increased from\nfifteen (1.4% of the total) in 1977/8 to 274\n(26.3% of the total) in 1982/3. In Engineering\nthe decline has been more sudden with all\n'alpha' graded projects funded in 1977/8 but\nin 1982/3 149 (27.8% of the total) went\nun funded. The report indicates that this funding\nshortfall has resulted in many older\nacademics stopping research work and in\nyounger intellectuals leaving the UK for\nEurope and America in order to obtain\nresearch funding. It is concluded that unless\nail 'alpha' projects can be funded the\ninstability of higher education in Britain will\nbe lost resulting, in a reduction in the quality\nof trained manpower in science and\nengineering.\nProfessor G Bull of Metallurgy and\nMaterials Science acted as one of the\nconsultants to the report's Steering Group.\nPG Tips First of all, may I, on behalf of the\nPostgraduate Group, welcome all new PG's starting at Imperial College this week. By\nnow you've no doubt heard a thousand times\nhow wonderful IC is, it's all true!!! Be you\nMSc or PhD, I hope you have a happy and\nsuccessful stay.\nAs you will soon find out IC has an\nunusually high proportion of PG s about 30%\nat present, rising to 40% over the next few\nyears. Unfortunately, what with the pressure\nof work and a diversity of outside\ncommitments, a large number never see the\nCollege outside of working hours. This is a great pity as the College and particularly the\nStudents Union has many facilities to offer.\nFrom some of the best College Sports Clubs\nin Britiain to a wide range of recreational and\nsocial activities. I Urge you to get involved.\nThe biggest independent group in College\nhowever is the Postgraduate Group, you are\nall automatically members. I hope you will\ninvolve yourselves and help organise its\nactivities. We can only provide events if we\nget support. Our first General Meeting will\nbe at 4.00pm in the Holland(along the\nwalkway towards the Huxley building) on\nTuesday 2 October. This will be followed\nlater by a disco at 8.00pm with a cheap bar.\nTickets will be free but limited in numbers. I suggest you attend the meeting if you want to\nguarantee getting in as there will be very few\ntickets on the door.\nAs Chairman of the PG group I sit on the\nGraduate Studies Committee and IC\nCouncil and we also have a representative on\nthe Safety Council. So if you have any\ncomplaints or suggestions about your\ncourse, working conditions, or the running of\nthe Students Union, please drop me a note\nvia the IC Union Office or the Subwardens\nFlat, Falmouth Hall. I shall see what I can do!\nThis year we have an exceptionally strong\nPostgraduate Committee. Who will give you\nas much support as you give them. We'd like\na busy year. Chris Hendy\nPG Chairman 1984/85\nSil wood Sports1 st annual PG-Silwood Sports Day\nThe first annual Silwood Park\u2014South Ken\npost grad sports day took the form of a13 \u2014a \u2014side cricket match; that is the South\nKen captain took 13 'players'and informed\nthe Silwood skipper once it was too late to\ndo. The date was the first cloudy Friday of\nSeptember, the venue: Silwood Park,\nSunningdale; transport: minibus. The\njourney was rapid, with only one stop\u2014on a roundabout, to avoid a car which had right of\nway. It was still early morning without a Silwood soul stirring as practice started and\nlunch was taken until it was time to start.\nBeing impoverished post grads, there was no\ncoin to toss with, so the Silwood skipper,\ncovering his watch, asked our captain\nwhether the second hand was closer to the\nsix or twelve. He must have pondered for half\na minute before guessing correctly, to field\nfirst\u2014a sensible decision since Silwood were\nstill missing men, and since he was providing\nthe new ball and knew how it was likely to\nswing in such conditions. Too right, 23 wide s were bowled\u2014but it certainly fooled the\nopening batsmen and exhausted the\nsignalling umpire who would still have to bat.\nSo despite the potential penetration of the\nstrike bowlers, quick bowling changes were\nmade, with the skipper himself coming on to\nbowl. By the fourth ball of the over the non-striker was falling asleep, mes meri sed by the\nflight of the gently lobbed ball, and by the\nwhistle as the leather spun wicket wards through the air he rested on his bat while his\npartner, at last making contact with the ball,\ndashed up the wicket attempting a quick run.\nReliable Smith returned the ball to the\nwicket keeper, a simple run-out, and first\nblood to South Ken\nProgress was slow against tight bowling,\nwith Barnett, the leg-spinner and yarn-spinner, keeping one end wider control, and\nRynbeck taking the next two wickets to fall.\nA couple of hookers were soon together in\nthe middle, but with a fielder placed square\njust beneath the horizon, Barnett knew how\nto tempt them; and before long Smith and\nJones were beneath mistimed shots. Jeynes,\nIslam and the skipper then took control of\nthe situation, and brilliant captaincy brought\nthe run-rate to a standstill\u2014by constantly\nmoving fielders around and forgetting about\nbowling the ball. And when the bat-flinging\nfinal overs arrived, Baggs behind the stumps\nbagged two stumping s off Graham, with the\nhome finishing on 136, Larter swinging his\nbat, and scoring 15 in 24 balls, and Day\nhaving a good afternoon with 29.\nAt tea, South Ken were 23 without loss,\nalthough Collins went soon after: but Jones\nand Chew punished anything short, hitting\nhigh over the rabbit-droppings on either side\nof the wicket. The all-rounder, Ellison, who\nwas imported for the match (recognise that\nname?) replaced Larter after a spell of six\novers of left-arm lobs, after he had taken a wicket in the 5th and the 6th; with Le\nMesurier bowling a good length, at 53 for 3\nSilwood were in a healthy position. But\nwait\u2014isn't that Ian-Botham-give -it-a wallop-Richard striding to the wicket. In three steps\nhe's out there, hits a six off his third ball, and\nSouth Ken are whirl winding to victory\nWhen the rain began, play continued.\nWhen the sky blackened, and the heavens\nopened, and the wicket keeper couldn't see\nthe ball, Richard hit another six. But at that,\nthe fielders ran for cover, still40 runs needed\nin 20 overs.\nJones by now out, but still punishing\nanything short, sent the captain to the\nminibus to collect a few bottles of beer to\nhelp pass the time. The umpires made an\ninspection and decided it was fit for play, and\nshortly afterwards the rain relented, the sun\nshone, casting long shadows. A few, fielding\nslips occurred as not even Adams' pace\nbowling could stem the flow of runs, and\nSouth Ken duly won at, 6.20pm. Drinks followed, until about 10.15,and\nWarwick Road was sighted at 11.30. The\npetrol-station 'mastermind' card gave the\nanswer 'Colin Cowdrey', and the empties\nwere taken away by Dave's girlfriend who\nteaches in an infants school, she thought the\nchildren might like them. Final thanks go to\nJeremy Rudd, their captain, and to Chris\nHendy who couldn't turn up.\nSilwood 136(Extra 29, Adams, 29 Day 21,\nBarnett 3-24, Rynbeck 2-14, Islam 2-17,\nGraham 2-28)\nSouth Ken 137-5 (Jones 30, Chew 37,\nRichard 44 not out; Larter2-29, Le Mesurier\n2-29)\nSouth Ken won by lots of wickets.\nPat Pocock, Physics Dept\n4 Monday 1 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

The two\ngunmen, one wearing what\nappeared to be a policeman's uniform, fought with the guards\nas they were about to enter the\ncorridor leading from the rear of\nthe Sherfield building to the\nbank.\nA shot was fired by one of the\ngunmen who then made off with\nthe cash. One of the guards gave\nchase while the other alerted\nbank officials who phoned for\nthe police.\nThe gunmen split up after the\nshot was fired. One ran around\nthe back of the Lyon Playfair\nLibrary towards 170 Queensgate\nwhile the other ran through the\ncorridor in the basement of\nSherfield.\nA student eye-witness who was\non the Walkway at the time of the\nincident also gave chase. He ran\nthrough the Huxley Building,\nhoping to intercept the robbers in\nQueensgate. They had already\nmade their get-a way, however,\npossibly by means of a waiting\ncar.\nThe robbers were described as\n1) white, apparent age 40/42,\nstocky build, 5'11/6', black hair,\nstraight moustache, dressed as a policeman. 2) white, apparent\nage 30/35, dark clothing, white\ncrash helmet.\nAnyone who saw either of the\ntwo men above, or who saw\nanything suspicious, should\ncontact Chief Security Officer,\nGeoffrey Reeves.\nThe crime-rate at College is\nfalling, according to a recent\nreport by the local police.\nOnly 66 bicycles were stolen\nfrom within \u2022 the College last\nsession, a drop from 102 in 1982-83. Local police see this as\nvindication of their cycle coding\npolicy, where owners have their\npostcode and house number\nstamped on their bicycle frame.\nMany people are unable to give\nthe frame number of a bike after\nit is stolen, so the coding gives an\neasily remembered number.\nFree cycle coding sessions will\nbe held this year on the ground\nfloor of the Sherfield Building\nthroughout the first week of\nterm, from 9.00am to 5.00pm( Tuesday 12 noon to 5.00pm). The new policeman for the\nCollege, PC Andy Bennie, can be\ncontacted through the Union\nOffice, the Security Office, or by\nphone at Gerald Road Police\nStation on 434 6533.\nMicro s missing Micro computers worth around\n\u00a38,000 have been stolen from the\nCollege during the summer\nvacation.\nA total of ten machines, all\neither BBCs or Apples, have been\nreported stolen, mainly from the\nChemical Engineering and\nAeronautics Building.\n'The first theft occured in late\nJuly when three micro s were\nstolen',said Mr J Boroughs,\nSecurity Officer.\n'Five more went during\nAugust, and two during September.'\nMost of the missing micro s were situated in laboratories. It is\nthought by administrators in the\nbuilding that the thefts occured\neither soon after 5.30pm or in the\nearly hours of the morning.\nThe number of thefts, and the\napparent ease with which they\nwere executed, highlights the\nproblems with security on the\ncampus. The whole question is\ncurrently under revision by\nsenior College officials. One\ncourse open to them is to secure\nhigh-risk areas with a new,\nimproved 'Assa' lock that has\nrecently come on the market.\nI \u2022\nNorman Jardine, the new Union Catering Manager, was confident last\nweek that the Union Snack Bar would open today, on schedule.\nThe small refectory in the Union Building was run by the College until\nthe Union's successful take-over bid in August this year.\nThe snack bar, open from 10.00am to 3.00pm, plans to sell a selction of\ncold and hot food including salads, pies, quiches, filled sandwiches, soup,\nand deserts such as cheesecake and gate aux. This is in contrast to the\ntraditional 'meat and two ve g' meal available from the College\nrefectories.\nThe snack-bar will also provide cold drinks and freshly-filtered coffee.\nMr Jardine, pictured left, was appointed by the Union on September 1\nto establish the new snack-bar. He comes to Imperial College after doing\na post-graduate catering course at Sunderland Polytechnic.\nFree! Monday 1 October 1984 No 680\n\n"

    "content": "FCLUBS\nRCC Vacancy\nThe Recreational Clubs Committee (RCC)\nneeds a Vice-Chairman (who also serves as\nFinance Officer). A Vice-Chairman is vital to\nthe smooth running of RC C and an election is\nbeing called immediately. Election papers are\nnow up on the Union noticeboard on the right\nhand side ofthe main Union Entrance. Papers\ncome down at 5.30pm on Monday 15\nOctober, and the election will be held at an\nExtra-ordinary General Meeting of RC C on\nThursday 18 October in the Union Upper\nlounge at 6.00pm. Candidates need a proposer and two\nsecond ers, who must all be full members of IC Union.\nGLIDING\nGliding 1st for IC\nImperial College came 1st2 nd and 3rd in the\n'Wooden' class of the Inter-University\nGliding competition during the summer.\nIC Gliding Club hosted the 'Task Week' at\ntheir home airfield of Lasham near\nBasingstoke. The competition involved flying\na preset cross-country circuit (a 'task'), by\nriding currents of rising air, or thermals.\nThis year ten universities took part, with a total of sixteen gliders com petit ing in two\ncategories, Wooden and Glass. In the Glass\nClass Surrey University came 1st and 3rd, and Reading came 2nd. Here Malcolm Andrews of the Gliding\nClub describes a typical flight. Gliding Club\ncan be contacted at Freshers' Fair, or on\nThursdays at 5.30pm in Aero 254.\nHaving been towed to 2000 feet we caught\nseveral fairly weak thermals taking us\ntowards Greenham Common airbase. By\nluck we stumbled into stronger lift taking us\nup to 4000 feet, and on to Newbury race\ncourse.\nAt the race course we found more lift,\nmanaging to scrape our way up to 3500feet. Back down to 2000feet and we were looking\nfor a landing field, but our unpromising cloud\ngave us the best lift of the day to 5000 feet.\nWe used the extra height to round the point\nat Newbury and head off back to home.\nBack down to 2000 feet again and we\nchoose a landing field. The landing involved\na tack alongside the field to look for\nobstructions (and the local pub) in losing the\nremaining height with the air brakes, and a final circuit into the landing.\nWe found our way to the pub, phoned our\nretrieving crew, and had a bite to eat. Once\nthe crew arrived we packed the glider away,\nand arrived back at Lasham just after\nmidnight. The flight lasted 2 hours, fairly\ntypical for the week.\nSTOIC\nStudent TV Ah! So you've got here at last! I expect you\nhave been idly flicking through the pages of\nFELIX while the Rector has been droning on, and I hope you found it more interesting than\nhis speech usually is (we had a new one two\nyears ago, so an update isn't due for about\nanother eight!), While I have your attention\nthen, I would like to tell you about one of the\nUnion's other media, STOIC \u2014 STUDENT TELEVISION OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE. STOIC provides a colour television\nservice to students at IC, broadcasting twice\na week over a campus-wide cable network\n(cable television is not new around here!). If\nyou live in a Hall of Residence, then you can\nwatch our programmes on your Hall TV Set.\nYou can also watch in the J CR and the\nSouthside TV lounge.\nProgrammes are shown on Tuesday and\nThursday lunchtimes at 1.00pm with a repeat\nshowing at 6.00pm. On Tuesdays, we show\ndocumentary-type programmes or interviews with celebrities\u2014Cliff Richard, David\nAttenborough and Gordon Jackson have\nrecently been guests\u2014and on Thursdays\nNEWS BREAK is shown. NEWS BREAK is a news magazine programme covering subjects involving, or of interest to, students,\nincluding the lunatic antics of Rag Collectors;\nthe perennial (and more serious) complaints\nabout poor refectories and accommodation;\nthe latest film releases\u2014with clips\u2014in 'Film\nReview'; Theatre Review, and many other\nitems. STOIC also maintains an extensive\nvideo archive stretching back over the past\n15 years,and sabbatical officers have been\nknown to subsequently regret certain\nstatements made during their election\ncampaigns. All our broadcasts are followed\nby up to the minute weather forecasts,\nillustrated by animated sequences from\n'Meteosat' supplied by the Atmospheric\nPhysics Department(as used on 'Breakfast\nTime').\nOn Tuesday we will be showing a special\ncompilation from last year's programmes,\nand on Thursday, the first edition of\nNEWS BREAK will be on the air, with a round-up of some of the goings on around\nCollege over the Summer, coverage of\nFreshers Fair, plus most of the regular\nfeatures mentioned above. Incidently, if a motley crew of scruffy individuals waving aTV camera bear down on you at the Fair, the\nsafest thing to do is to answer the questions\nand hope that they will then go away!\nIf you are, or might be interested in joining\nSTOIC, you can see us at Freshers Fair(in\nthe Sherfield lower Refectory), from where\nwe will be running tours of the College TV Studio which is situated on the walkway,\nunderneath the Elec Eng building. If you can't make it then, below is a list of introductory\nevents for the first two weeks.\nWhether or not you are interested in\njoining, we hope that you will enjoy watching\nour productions this coming year as much as\nwe will enjoy making them for you.\nThursday 4 October\nCome to the TV Sudio at 6.00pm to see the\ntransmission of the first edition of NEW SBREAK for this academic year. Afterwards,\nwe will be holding an informal gathering in the\nStudio, where you can find out more about\nSTOIC.\nTuesday 9 October\nFor those who could not attend last\nThursday, we will be repeating our introduction to STOIC. If you did come on\nThursday, you will be able to take a more\ndetailed look at the equipment.\nWednesday 10 October\nWatch NEWS BREAK being recorded in the\nStudio at about 5.00pm. The programme is\nalways produced during Wednesday afternoon and evening.\n'DuracelP\nThe Studio Control Room during a recording session\n18 Monday 1 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"
