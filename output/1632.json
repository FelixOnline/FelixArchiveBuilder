This many years on, it\u2019s still as popular as ever, with many\nvariations available.\nI\u2019m not going to lie; it\u2019s as loud as it is powerful. This is not one to use with\nyour housemates chilling out in the next room, unless, like me, you\u2019re a bit of an\nexhibitionist. Considerate usage aside, there are justified reasons that women have\nraved about this for decades. Being mains powered, this magic gadget can deliver\nincredibly powerful vibrations for as long as you desire, although you\u2019ll probably\nfind yourself getting into multiple orgasm territory within a f ew minutes.\nAlthough I\u2019ve had some amazing orgasms with the Magic Wand, and have found\nmyself at near-addiction levels of distraction by having it in the house, I do find\nthat the vibration can be too intense, sometimes preventing me from seeing my\nclimax through to the end. The strength of the vibration can, with prolonged use,\nlead to short term loss of sensation in the stimulated area, which isn\u2019t necessarily\na bad thing if you\u2019re using it solo, but can sometimes lead to a temporary loss of\nappreciation for other stimuli.\nI would recommend it for anyone who finds it difficult to achieve an orgasm\nconsistently, or who wants to get themselves off, hard, in a very short amount of\ntime.\nTested for your\npleasure\nI\nf there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019ve learnt over the course\nof my adult life, it\u2019s how to get myself off, and I\ndon\u2019t think there\u2019s any shame in admitting that. In\nrecent years, more and more women have begun\ntaking control of their sexuality, and although there is\nstill a huge stigma attached to female masturbation, the\nsex toy market has silently turned into a huge industry,\nwith thousands of products to tickle your fancy however\nyou like it.\nFrom the early days of Ann Summers parties, to the\nadvent of (discreetly packaged) internet shopping, to\nvibrators being stocked on the shelves in Superdrug,\nwe\u2019ve come a long way. This revolution is unquestionably\nthanks to certain iconic gadgets that have made women\nso excited that they\u2019ve broken down social boundaries to\nshare them.\nSex toys these days range from the cheap to the\nhigh-end \u2013 from those who want to get themselves off\nrepeatedly with a vibrator that cost a fiver to those who\nwant to drop a ton on a more luxury glass dildo. Some\nare made from cheap plastic, and others are pieces of art\nin themselves, designed to be displayed when not in use.\nThese don\u2019t always have to be solo escapades either. I\u2019ve\nused every sex toy that I\u2019ve ever owned with a partner, to\nvarying degrees of success: from the guy so intimidated\nthat he only wanted to go near small clitoral vibrators\n(but appreciated the break they gave to his fingers and\ntongue) to the guy who kept stealing them for his own\npersonal use.\nThe world is starting to realise that women love to\nrub one out as much as men, and whether you\u2019re already\nacquainted with battery-powered pleasure,or just starting\nto look around, there\u2019s always going to be something new\nout there for you to try.\nThe Magic Wand\nThe bullet vibrator\nT\nhe bullet vibrator has revolutionised discreet masturbation for women\nall over the world. Coming in many different designs, including some\ndisguised as lipsticks, the bullet is subtle, and can bring quick and\nsilent pleasure. Being so small, the bullet is only really good for clitoral\nstimulation, but is great if you want to get yourself off quickly. You can easily use it\nwith other toys to customise the experience.\nI\u2019ve owned many of these, and they definitely have different vibrational intensities,\nso depending on what you like, it might be worth spending an extra couple of quid\non this. In my experience, these things eat through the batteries, and there\u2019s nothing\nworse than having the power wane when you need it. Even so, one of these comes\nwith me in my make-up bag whenever I travel, and in all the years I\u2019ve been doing\nthis, I\u2019ve never had any awkward discovery moments.\nHonestly, I think that everyone should own one of these, and take the time to\ndiscover all the different ways that you can use it.\nN\now available with as many features as you can imagine, the rabbit\nvibrator was dreamed up in the 1990s, following demand for sex toys\nthat provided simultaneous vaginal and clitoral stimulation.\nI have several friends who claim to have been sexually awakened, and\nto have had their first orgasms by the ownership of a rabbit vibrator, and based\non such recommendations, I\u2019ve bought several. While I can\u2019t argue that they don\u2019t\nwork, they always end up languishing in my drawer, taken out only for a very\noccasional craving.\nAlthough more luxurious versions are available, most rabbit vibrators are made of\nthis jelly-like, plasticky material, which never loses the smell of rubber (even after\nyears). I\u2019m definitely a hard-and-firm-vibrator kind of girl, so these just don\u2019t tick\nmy boxes. Aside from the texture, I\u2019ve always found it a bit of a faff to correctly\nalign the different parts of the vibrator to get the stimulation that really does it for\nme.\nI recommend this for anyone who\u2019s new to using sex toys for vaginal penetration.\nYou can get ones that are a bit smaller for beginners (there\u2019s nothing wrong with\nbeing nervous!), and there are so many varieties out there that there\u2019s one to suit\neveryone.\nThe Rampant Rabbit\nI wasn\u2019t allowed to include photos of eerily realistic dildos.\nPhoto Credit: flowerpicturegalery.com\nI\u2019m a slut and\nproud\nI\n\u2019ve been called a slut more\ntimes than I can count, both as\nan insult and as a compliment.\nWhilst some people recoil\nfrom the notion of a sexually\nempowered female, many celebrate\nus girls who openly love sex.\nI\u2019ve long felt the idea that men love\nsex and women need love is absurd.\nI\u2019d rather have steamy sex than\ncuddle watching The Notebook. I\u2019d\nrather fuck than make love.I\u2019d rather\nmy partner call me a little bitch than\nhis little princess. Not all girls like\nhearts and flowers, lots of us like\nprimal, raw and outright dirty sex.\nAnd that is totally okay. I\u2019ve slept\nwith many people, both male and\nfemale. I\u2019ve kissed even more. New\nsexual experiences are exciting and\nI love exploring new things. What\u2019s\nthe harm in trying? After all, you\nnever know unless you try; a bit like\ntrying new foods. That is not to say\nyou should be reckless or take risks\n\u2013 contraception,protection and self-care are necessary.\nI have a regular partner with whom\nI explore the limits of sexuality in a\nsafe and controlled way. Sometimes\nwe get it wrong but we have been\non an incredible journey together,\nwhich would have been impossible\nwithout trust. Trust, respect and\ncommunication are so important\nwhen exploring sexuality.\nI embrace my sexuality and\nunashamedly own it. It is liberating\nto love sex and not give a damn\nwhat anybody else thinks. Go\nalong to a fetish party and you\u2019ll\nsee orgies, naked bodies and\ncouples having sex publicly. It is not\nintimidating, disgusting or wrong.\nOn the contrary, it is liberating,\nempowering and accepting. Society\nfrowns upon both nakedness and\nsex, yet they are not bad: after all it\u2019s\nonly natural.\nWe live in a society that celebrates\nmale players and shames female\nsluts, but that need not be the\ncase. Increasingly we are accepting\nfemale sexuality and those who\ndon\u2019t are jeered at. Western society\nis a long way from perfect, but it is\npossible for us girls to be sexually\nempowered. If we refuse backward\nnotions of smothered female\nsexuality and openly embrace\nourselves we can shake the stigma\nof being a slut.\nI don\u2019t feel judged for being a\nslut, nor do I take offence when I\nget called one. Not because people\naren\u2019t judging me, but because I\ndon\u2019t accept it.The word slut should\nnot be derogatory. I\u2019m proud to be\na slut because it means I\u2019m sexually\nempowered.\nThe G-spot vibrator\nT\nhe elusive G-spot, located somewhere on the front wall\nof the vagina, is traditionally ignored during sex and\nmasturbation, probably because it\u2019s awkward to get to,\nand it might not occur to you to go poking there for\nspecific pleasure. In this era of a vibrator for every occasion, one\ntype that has really made the difference to many women\u2019s orgasms\nis one that specifically targets the G-spot, precisely stimulating it\nto give powerful orgasms with or without the need for additional\nclitoral stimulation.\nG-spot stimulation can take some getting used to. With any sex\ntoy that stimulates your G-spot, it will take some practice to figure\nout the positioning that works for you, and G-spot stimulation, in\nany context,can be an intense new sensation that might feel strange\nat first. With some perseverance, recognising these sensations and\nbuilding on them has given me some of the strongest orgasms that\nI\u2019ve every experienced.\nVibrators and dildos designed to stimulate the G-spot come in\nmany shapes, designed for use with and without a partner. Anyone\nwho has never experienced the arousal and pleasure arising from\ntheir G-spot should be encouraged to experiment and seek it out \u2013\nit\u2019s worth the effort!\nE\nven in this enlightened age, many people are still afraid\nto talk about anal. While it may not be everyone\u2019s cup\nof tea, if you use plenty of lube, and take your time, it\ncan be something that both men and women can enjoy.\nButt plugs have been commercially available for more than a\nhundred years,demonstrating that there is nothing new or strange\nabout wanting to fire up these often ignored nerve endings.There\nare dozens of kinds of anal toys out there, but beyond a cheeky\nfinger, butt plugs are what usually first sell the intoxicating world\nof anal play.\nIn women, anal toys add a feeling of fullness, heighten\nsensitivity, and provide additional stimulation both in the ass and\nin the vagina through the walls. For many women, this can be\neye-opening,and enhance other sensations.Contrary to what I\u2019ve\nbeen told my whole life, I can assure you that the butt is not just\nfor the boys.\nThere\u2019s nothing strange of unusual about enjoying anal play\neither with a partner or as part of your solo routine, and by using\nanal toys such as butt plugs instead of going in all guns blazing,\npeople are starting to realise how much fun it can be.\nThe butt plug\n\u201cWho here has ever been called a slut?\u201d Photo Credit: Sire Paramount Pictures\nAnonymous\nWriter\nWe need to end the trope that\nwomen make love, and accept\nthat they like sex\nDO THE SEX SURVEY\nCloses this Thursday\nfelixonline.co.uk/go/sexsurvey\n\n"

Even\nif you\u2019ve got an exam that day,\nflying home to recover from one,\nor like me, are furiously cobbling\ntogether a newspaper, you can\nnominate someone to vote on your\nbehalf.

The answer is, well honestly,\nyou\u2019re way more likely to now than\nyou were in 2009. We explore some\nof the reasons why, but essentially,\nmost, if not all, departments are\ntrying their best to keep degrees\nconsistent whilst changing them\ncontinuously to make sure students\naren\u2019t penalised by variations in\nexam difficulty between modules.\nSo if you are freaking out about\ngetting that coveted first, just\nremember that higher marks are so\ncommon now that employers are\ntending to look for graduates with a\nlittle more to offer.

When this came\nup at council, the rep said she would\n\u201clike all our organisations to become\nliving wage organisations\u201d.\nAlthough council was not quorate,\na straw poll vote was taken, and\nthere was a general consensus for\nsubscription to the service. The\ndecision, like all, will ultimately go\nto Trustee Board, which consists\nof the full time sabbatical officers,\nunion management staff and other\nnon-student members.\nDuring discussions, one council\nmember asked whether or not this\nwould overlap with hirings the\nunion had made two years before.\nThe sabbs said that training wasn\u2019t\ncurrently being offered in the\ncapacity that they\u2019d like. Others\nquestioned whether there was a\ndemand amongst Imperial students\nto even instigate campaigns.\nWhen asked, no one quite knew\nwhich budget the subscription fee\nwould come from, if the deal went\nahead. It seemed likely that it would\ncome from the student development\nfund, but full union budgeting for\nnext year is yet to take place.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nCitizens UK charge \u00a35000 a year for campaigns training for sabbs and volunteers\nUnion may affiliate with campaigning charity\nOthers\nquestioned\nwhether\nthere was a\ndemand for\nthis London Living Wage is one of their famed campaigns.

Spoilers\nahead (obviously).\nThis being the first season to\ncompletely overtake the books in\nnearly every plotline did fuel some\nspeculation that this season would\ncontinue a downward trend after\nthe relatively mediocre season five\nbut this episode, at least, was pretty\nokay, if a bit slow. If nothing else\nthere wasn\u2019t any \u2018bad poossy\u2019 level\nwriting at least.\nNot shying away from the events\nof last season, the episode opened\nwhere we last left off, with a shot\nof Kit Harrington\u2019s Jon Snow\nlying dead in the grounds of Castle\nBlack before being scooted away by\nDavos. No resolution or progression\non that plot thread just yet then.\nMoving a little further south to\nRamsay freaking out after his wife\nand buddy ran off together, we\nsee him showing a rare display of\nemotion at the death of Myranda\nbefore sending her body off to feed\nhis dogs. Classic Ramsay.\nTheon and Sansa finding Brienne\nand Podrick was a pretty good\nscene. As always, it\u2019s a pleasure to\nsee Alfie Allen in this role as well\nas Pod finally learning to fight. It\u2019s\ngood to see Brienne finally getting\nto fulfil her oath after a season and a\nhalf of hiking around the continent\nand occasionally getting the shit\nkicked out of her.\nVarys strolling around Meereen,\nbuying babies, listening to Red\nPriests. Nothing much going on\nhere other than a dick joke and a\nport fire.\nDaenerys\u2019 scene, surprisingly, was\nthe main source of comic relief in\nthe episode with a conversation\nbetween two of the Dothraki that\ncould have come out of a Seth\nRogen movie and then a Monty\nPython-esque squabble with Khal\nMoro and his bloodriders: \u201cOk,\nseeing a beautiful woman naked for\nthe first time is among the five best\nthings in life!\u201d\nArya\u2019s training continues, albeit\nwhile blinded and homeless. Girl\ncan\u2019t catch a break. On the plus side,\neventually she\u2019ll get Daredevil like\nskills.\nMelisandre\u2019s scene at the end\nproved to be the most intriguing of\nthe episode (and not because of the\nobligatory HBO toplessness) with\nher transformation into a withered\nold woman. Where this leads\nremains to be seen.

On Saturday 23rd\nApril, 15 runners from the\nImperial College Cross\nCountry and Athletics Club\nromped home to fourth place in\nthe Batavierenrace. With 348 teams\ncovering 172km through Holland\nand Germany, the race demanded\nhigh levels of speed, endurance,\nstrategy,and tolerance to Dutch rave\nculture from the teams. Finishing\nthis strongly in the world\u2019s biggest\nrelay race represents one of the\nclub\u2019s finest collective achievements\nin recent years.\nThe Batavierenrace kicked off at\n12.45am, and was divided into four\nstages: Night, Morning, Afternoon\nand Finale. Athletes were paired up\nand assigned to a set of two legs,\nwith one running and the other\ntaking on cycling duties, before\narriving at the end of the first leg\nand swapping over. The pairs would\nattempt to finish together at the\ncheckpoint, handing over to two\nmore athletes, who would vest and\nsaddle up before heading into the\nDutch countryside.\nThe surrealism of plunging head\nfirst into the inky blackness was\nnot lost on the night team. Bicycle\nheadlamps and minibuses that\ntwinkled in the distance were the\nsole sources of light for the majority\nof the route, and techno music\nblared from every available output\nwithin the Dutch border. Leanne\nLyons was the star of the evening,\nputting in a storming first leg to\nsecure the overall lead, running\n3.6km in 14:08. From then on,\nit was a fight to stay afloat. As we\ncrossed in and out of Germany, a\nnumber of chaotic changeovers and\nmisdirection from a marshal meant\nthat the team found themselves\ndown in 28th\nposition by the end\nof the night stage, a rapid fourth-fastest Leg 8 from Anna Lawson the\nremaining highlight of an otherwise\ndifficult night for the team.\nThe sun rose, the techno grew\nlouder, the trailing minibuses\nregrouped and the morning team\nwas loaded. Our athletes responded\nwell to the sunlight, with Matt\nDouthwaite, Anna Lawson, Chris\nThomas,MaddieWhybrow,Michael\nCrone and Alwyn Elliott putting in\ntop-10 performances in their legs to\ndrag Imperial up to eighth position\nin the standings. Dutch athletes,\nweakened from a night of heavy\nraving,brass music and an admirable\nrefusal to sleep, were left in our\nwake as Michael won his 7.6km leg\nin an eye watering 26:56 minutes.\nFatigue and merciless amounts of\nBasshunter began to take their toll\non the teams, with minibuses seen\ndriving off in different directions\nand Imperial losing time over a\nbotched changeover. The ability to\nmaintain composure and execute\nour strategy and logistics grew in\nimportance, with Matt and Alwyn\nholding on masterfully in cramped\nconditions and without sleep to\nensure the team was always on track.\nWithout this aspect of our game,we\nwould have finished nowhere near\nthe front of the pack.\nThe afternoon team, by this\ntime rendered half-deaf by Avicii,\ncontinued our ascent to the giddy\nheights of fifth on the leaderboard.\nChris Thomas and Matt\nDouthwaite ignored the changing\nweather conditions to deliver first\nand third places respectively, with\nSusanna Tabor and Alwyn Elliot\nhanding over strongly to Alex\nWarnakulasuriya and Leanne\nLyons, who powered into the\nrapturous crowds of Enschede with\na pair of ninth places between them.\nThe team had done their job and\nset the stage for a barnstorming\nevening finale, with fourth place the\nobjective.\nEnter Nuria Devos. Our\ndiminutive Spanish exchange\nstudent was born for the weekend\nof no sleep, high voltage thunder-trance that crushed a number of\nher British teammates. The gun\nsounded and Nuria was released\nfrom her cage, eyes lit, teeth bared,\nan inextinguishable fire that tore\nacross the Dutch cobbles to 12th\nplace. Michael Crone followed\nin typically electrifying fashion,\nescaping the furious beats of\nEnschede at breathtaking pace to\narrive at the University of Twente\nin fourth place against fearsome\nopposition. At the death, it was\nMichael\u2019s leg that earned Imperial\nfourth place in the Batavierenrace.\nWith the exception of the few\nwho had participated in this race\ntwo years ago, no athlete could\nhave anticipated the physical and\nmental mill we were put through\nthis weekend. No runner could have\npractised racing through what was\nfor one night the world\u2019s biggest\nnightclub. Yet it was the closeness\nof this team, and their resolute\nspirit, that carried the runners, bikes\nand buses towards near-victory at\nthe Batavierenrace. Every member\nplayed their part, every runner\nran as hard as they could through\nunfamiliar and uncompromising\nconditions, and everyone who\ntook part will hold this race up as\na highlight of their athletic careers\nand time at Imperial College. The\nBatavierenrace is to be feared,\nrespected,and ultimately conquered,\nand no amount of electro-musical\ntorment from the Dutch could\nprevent us from achieving our goal.\nFatigue and\nmerciless\namounts of\nBasshunter\nbegan to\ntake their toll Waiting for the action to begin.

I\u2019m not saying that all\nFrench films are bad \u2013 that would\nbe ridiculous. My argument,\nwhich I would hope is at least\nsomewhat informed, is that the\nFrench \u2018style\u2019 of filmmaking is\njust something I cannot stand:\npretentious dialogue, a penchant\nfor lengthy, static shots, and a\nweird fascination with narratives\nfocusing on young women falling\nin love with old men. You may\nhave started it France, but the rest\nof Europe is going to finish it:\nThe Hunt (2012)\nStarting on a high,The Hunt is a\nDanish film focusing on Hannibal\nstar Mads Mikkelsen who, when\nfalsely accused of molesting a\nyoung girl at his primary school,\nis made an outcast and a villain\nin his local community. It is far\nfrom the cheeriest film in the\nworld, but the sympathy it elicits\nand the flawless performances of\nthe deeply complex characters\nset it apart as a masterpiece. The\nScandinavians are just so bloody\ngood at this.\nBicycle Thieves (1948)\nBicycle Thieves is a classic Italian\nfilm most often found on the\ntop ten lists of desperately elitist\nfilm critics. Looking past this\nhowever, it\u2019s still rather good, and\nwhat makes the film stand out is\nthe unique snapshot it gives us of\npost-war Italy. The rather simple\nstory here simply serves, to me, as\nan excuse to lose yourself in the\nbuzzing atmosphere of Italy just\nafter WWII.\nChico and Rita (2010)\nChico and Rita is a vibrant\nand exciting Spanish/English\nanimated feature showcasing\nthe brilliant world of 1940s\nCuban jazz. From its unique and\ngorgeous art style, to its music\nand settings, Chico and Rita is\nabsolutely captivating \u2013 gorgeous\nfrom start to finish.\nBEN COLLIER\nDocumentary corner: Blackfish\nBen Collier\nWriter\nB\nack in November of last\nyear I wrote one of my first\n\u2018Documentary Corner\u2019\nfeatures on the film The\nCove \u2013 a powerful environmentalist\npiece which showcased the grim\nreality of dolphin and whale\nhunting in Japan. As I mentioned\nin that review, The Cove remains\none of a relatively small list of\ndocumentaries which have made me\nproperly address and re-think some\nof my own opinions and actions.\nOne section of the film which really\nstood out to me was the discussion\nof where dolphins and whales who\nwere caught in the wild were sent:\nocean parks, it seems, pay top dollar\nfor healthy Cetaceans to showcase,\nwith little concern over their\nwellbeing. Therefore, it\u2019s probably\nfair to say that my opinion of places\nlike SeaWorld was already quite low\ngoing into this week\u2019s film, the 2010\nOscar-winner Blackfish; it doesn\u2019t\nget any better.\nHere, the focus is entirely on\nthese parks, and the multitude of\nethical and safety issues they pose.\nThrough the film, we track the\nlife of one captive whale, Tilikum,\nand the viewer really gets to see\nthe increasing mental toll that\ncaptivity takes on his wellbeing,\nas well as the danger he poses to\nothers. What one learns by the time\nthe end credits are rolling perhaps\nshould be obvious from the get-go:\nKiller Whales are prone to killing.\nThis not-so-shocking revelation is\nhandled with a fitting seriousness,\nand developed upon with a breadth\nof stories of trainers being injured\nor killed at the hands of their orca\ntrainees. Then, come the third act,\nthe focus switches to outlining the\nlengths these water parks will go to\ncover this all up.\nThe investigative journalism\nperformed by the film is perhaps\nits strongest feature: for each attack\nshowcased, several close friends and\ncolleagues of the trainer affected\nare interviewed \u2013 often the same\nfaces return for multiple cases \u2013\ngiving a genuine emotional edge\nto the reporting, that never feels\nmanipulative. Interestingly, most\nof the people interviewed are ex-trainers at places like SeaWorld.\nFootage of them in their younger\nyears, bright and enthusiastic,\ntraining with some of the eventual\nvictims, is effectively juxtaposed\nwith footage of them today \u2013 older\nand more experienced. What they\n\u2013 as well as the audience \u2013 now\nunderstand is that the supposed\n\u2018connection\u2019 they had with their\nwhales was never real.\nAs a film with a message, Blackfish\nis a masterclass. But unlike many\nsimilar films, it actually managed to\nspur on real-world change, playing\nan essential role in getting SeaWorld\nto announce the cancellation of its\norca breeding programme.\nIt\u2019s rare to see a single film have\nthat much effect. We can only\nhope this will see an end to whale\nshows too. As I have mentioned\nbefore, I don\u2019t necessarily mind\na documentary with an agenda,\nprovided it doesn\u2019t twist the truth\nand (most importantly) isn\u2019t\nboring. Blackfish is not only a vitally\nimportant film, but one that is\ngripping and interesting from start\nto finish.\nDoes Blackfish mark the beginning of the end for SeaWorld? Photo Credit: Blackfish PR/Reuters\nKung-Fu, Kickstarter, and how\ncrowdfunding is changing cinema\nS\ntruck by lightning and bitten\nby a cobra, Kung Fury is a\nkung-fu freak of nature and\nthe chosen one. Working as\na cop on streets drenched in neon\nand soaked in synth pop, he defends\n1980\u2019s Miami. Enter Adolf Hitler,\nA.K.A. the Kung-F\u00fchrer. On a\ntemporal murder spree to prove his\nsupremacy, Hitler must be stopped.\nWith the help of his friends\nHackerman, Triceracop (it\u2019s exactly\nwhat you think), and the Norse god\nThor (to name but a few) Kung Fury\nmust travel back in time to defeat\nthe Third Reich and take down the\nworst criminal in history.\nIf any of that got you thinking\n\u201cthis is ridiculous, I love it\u201d, then\njoin the crowd. Specifically, the\nalmost eighteen thousand others\nwho, like you, thought this thing\nshould be made, and crowdfunded\nDavid Sandberg on Kickstarter. On\nthe strength of a short trailer made\nwith his friends, online backers gave\nthe Swedish filmmaker $630,019\nto make a 30 minute long movie ,\njust because they thought it looked\nawesome.Their faith was rewarded.\nKung Fury is an homage and\nloving parody to the totally over\nthe top, enthrallingly ridiculous cop\nshows of the 80\u2019s. It\u2019s cheesy, and\nit knows it. At its core, it\u2019s a piece\nof meta-cinema that just wants to\nhave a blast, and pokes fun at the\nvarious tropes and cinematographic\nconventions of shows like Miami\nVice and Hawaii-Five-0 to hilarious\neffect. Indeed, its indulgence of\ntropes means it\u2019s entirely predictable\nin the final story outcome, but of\ncourse that\u2019s not what matters \u2013\nwhat matters is the journey, and\nmaking that journey as crazy and\nentertaining as possible.\nCrowdfunding has already altered\nthe bounds of what\u2019s possible\nin many industries. For those\nunfamiliar with the concept,the idea\nis simple: someone with an idea puts\ntheir proposal on a crowdfunding\nsite, and when people see an idea\nthey like, they pledge an amount\ntowards the project, sometimes in\nexchange for rewards such as a copy\nof the finished product. Many times\nthis simply boils down to people\nwanting to support a worthy cause,\nor just thinking something is too\ncool to not have it exist.\nThis simple idea has been made\npossible by the internet age, but\nwhen it\u2019s potentially so easy for\npeople to make their own videos\nand get funding, you\u2019ve got to\nask: what does this mean for the\nmedium? When will we see a totally\ncrowdfunded feature length film on\nthe silver screen? The answer is, we\nalready have, and more are on the\nway. Around half a dozen movie\nprojects have received backing of\nover $1 million. The biggest of\nthese, Super Troopers 2, is the sequel\nto the 2001 cult classic crime-comedy detailing the antics of five\nprankster Vermont state troopers\nbattling budget cuts, Super Troopers.\nSmashing its $2 million benchmark\nto end up with almost $4.5 million,\nit\u2019s scheduled to open sometime in\n2016.\nMore broadly, crowdfunding has\nhad a greater effect on the scale of\nsmaller independent filmmakers,\nmany of whom produce videos on\nYouTubewithhighproductionvalue.\nOne such channel, CorridorDigital,\nhave produced multiple short films\nand are currently working on a\nproduction of their own movie.\nAnother,RocketJump,has produced\nthree seasons of the series Video\nGame High School (VGHS) with\nKickstarter backing.\nThe upshot of this is that it\u2019s a great\ntime to be a talented filmmaker. If\nyou\u2019ve got ideas and guts you\u2019re no\nlonger obligated to go through film\nexecutives and large production\ncompanies to realise your vision.The\nconsequence? Creators can reach\na wider audience and still retain\ncreative control over their projects,\nleading to a diversification of the\nstories being told in the cinematic\nmedium. Nowadays, it\u2019s a lot more\nlikely that there\u2019ll be something out\nthere to fit your exact tastes, though\nyou may have to do a little digging\nto find it.\nCrowdfunding has and will\ncontinue to change what can\nfeasibly be achieved in cinema,\nmaking the production of movies\na process more intensely involved\nwith its audience. For those with a\nspare half hour I highly recommend\ngiving Kung Fury a watch and\nseeing for yourself the first tremors\ntravelling through the world of film.\nWhatever happens, its sure to be\ninteresting.\nTHOMAS CARROLL\nKickstarter is one of many crowdfunding options for budding creators, looking to shake up the world of cinema.

Photo Credit: New Statesman\nI\nf you\u2019re somehow reading this,\nyou\u2019re probably taking that\nsmall break in the library caf\u00e9\nbefore coming back upstairs\nfor your revision. Here we are! It\u2019s\nthe final term! You\u2019re probably, like\nme, starting to feel the library is not\nyour second, but your first home.\nIt is where all your life, aspirations,\nand social interactions will exist\nuntil you\u2019re done, and you\u2019re totally\ncool with becoming a completely\ndysfunctional piece of pseudo-zombie,trying to overstimulate your\ncaffeine-addict brain for the next\nfour weeks.\nAs you\u2019re sucked into the exam\nperiod lifestyle, you might believe\nthis is fairly normal behaviour. But\nit is not. Not even for classic top\nuniversity standards. This student\ngeneration is probably the most\nserious, diligent and hardworking in\nthe history of modern mainstream\nuniversity.Ifyou\u2019reunsureaboutthis,\nask your parents. The three to four\nyears of state-sponsored hedonism\nhas become a \u00a39,000 a year product\nyou buy in order to survive in the\novercrowded graduate job market.\nNever-ending bar nights are\noutnumbered by library all-nighters.\nStudent activism and fights with\nthe police are replaced by petitions\nto our unions to keep libraries open\nall night.And the idealist,politically\nengaged student is replaced by the\nnetworking-obsessed, internship\nseeking student.\nAll of this is part of a greater\ncultural shift.\nThink about what defined people\u2019s\naspirations before our times. There\nwas always some glue that made\neveryone, especially young people,\nconnect, and gave them a sense of\ncollective purpose. I can throw in\nsome examples. Centuries ago we\ncan talk about religion,or defending\nyour country, as something that\nmoulded this collective sense of\npurpose.\nAt the start of the last century, we\ncan think of socialists, anarchists\nand fascists around Europe.\nHowever you might feel about\nthem, you can see that they had\ntheir own mutual purpose, and an\nethos to look forward to (a world\nwithout government, a world\nwithout bourgeois oppression, a life\nsolved by your charismatic, overlord\ndictator).\nIn the 40s in Britain, the defining\nissue of their time was to win the\nwar against totalitarianism. In the\n60s, the hippies dreamt of a more\npeaceful, less restrictive and more\nloving society.\nAll of these examples have\nsomething in common. There\nwas always a sense of direction.\nWhether it was fighting for your\ncountry, fighting for the workers,\nfighting for peace and love, young\npeople had some ideal to look up to.\nA world to look forward to.\nThere is nothing like that today.\nNo higher ideal to look up to. The\ndefining issue of our time is a lack\nof sense of direction. This sense of\ncollective purpose is gone, absent,\ndead. It\u2019s been fully replaced by\nthe individual. Society, as a whole,\ndoesn\u2019t know where it is going since\nthe Berlin wall fell and the whole\nnotion of \u201cgood ones\u201d and \u201cbad\nones\u201d disappeared.\nThe end of collective ambition\nculturally leads to the postmodern\n(or post-postmodern) world we live\nin today. Art and creative expression\nis shown as a skeptical and playful\nresponse to any established\nconcept. It is defined by confident\nuncertainty about the world, a self-conscious, self-referential, skeptical\njudgement of today\u2019s culture. And\nthe perfect embodiment of this\ndeath of purpose is the figure of the\nhipster.\nYes, hipsters. The 60s gets hippies,\nthe 70s gets punks. And we get\nhipsters. By all means, I don\u2019t mean\nto complain about their existence,\nas so many people do. I\u2019m not some\nkind of subculture racist. I just tend\nto think of the hipster \u201cmovement\u201d\nas the perfect personification of\nour postmodern struggle to find\npurpose. The hippies wanted a\npeaceful world, punks wanted to\nliquidate the government. What do\nhipsters want?\nNothing. Or maybe something.\nWho knows? They don\u2019t know.They\nare inherently contradictory. They,\nlike postmodern artists, revolve\naround avoiding mainstream\ndogma, which ends up becoming a\ndogma in itself. They enjoy things\nironically instead of effusively.\nAny attempt to define how they\nusually dress will, as any attempt\nto define, look for common traits\nbetween hipsters, which will then\nbecome too mainstream for them,\nand will immediately make them\ndepart from those traits. And this\nlack of purpose is also a lack of\ncollective purpose, because the\nhipster is much more about the\nindividual than about the collective.\nIt is an empty, ironic, self-conscious\n\u201cmovement\u201d.\nThe loss of collective purpose,\nof that glue that would hold a\ngeneration together, is lost within\nour generation (or millennials, as\nbig companies like to call us). We\nare strangely individualistic. Maybe\nthe only dream we can think of for\nmillennials is building your own\nstartup and getting rich quickly.And\nfor the rest of us, securing that pre-internship, internship and graduate\njob we need to keep ourselves up to\nsocial expectations.\nI am not saying this situation is\ninherently bad. God, I sure prefer\nan individualistic, aimless and\nlost generation than a collective,\npurposeful Hitler Youth movement.\nBut there is something about the\nloss of any collective aspiration that\nis inherently sad in our apathetic,\nonline-petition-activist students.\nWe have become obsessed about the\nindividual.\nThere is some good news, though.\nAccording to Deloitte\u2019s Millennial\nsurvey 2016, millennials want a\njob that gives them purpose, not\njust a big salary. Companies are\nattempting to adapt to this whole\nnew workforce that values crazy\nthings like \u201cwork-life balance\u201d and\n\u201cjob satisfaction\u201d more than money.\nMaybe this is a good consequence\nof this lack of collective purpose\namong our generation. We attempt\nto find purpose individually, within\nour jobs. And hell, who am I to\njudge.\nIn the end, we are all here, at the\nedge of modern culture, trying to\nfind meaning, to make our own\nmeaning, or just to accept there is\nnone and desperately attempt to\nfeel something as we fuck our way\ntowards the end of days.\nHere we\nare! It\u2019s the\nfinal term!\nI\u2019m not\nsome\nkind of\nsubculture\nracist\nYou have bad taste if you like ales\nI\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m not from a country whose culture relies on such awful drinks\nPietro Aronica\nWriter\nNone of these are any good..

I thank\nthem because I have much more\ninternational football to remember\nfondly. I thank the gods because my\nPrime Minister isn\u2019t someone who\nput a private part of their anatomy\ninside a dead pig (although I curse\nthem because a former Prime\nMinister of mine put a private part\nof their anatomy inside an underage\ngirl).\nEvery day\nI wake up\nI thank the\ngods I\u2019m\nnot English\nI thank the gods because I wasn\u2019t\nborn somewhere where the phrase,\n\u201cit\u2019s a lovely sunny day today,\u201d is\nsaid far less often than, \u201cthis pasta\nis awfully overcooked,\u201d but most\nimportantly of all, I thank the\ngods for not making me from that\nnation that inflicted ales upon the\nworld. Maybe my wallet and my\nliver thank them less, because if I\u2019d\nthought that all beer tastes like ale, I\nwould\u2019ve enjoyed a lot less drinking,\nor pubs, or life in general.\nAles are awful. They\u2019re less\npleasant than strained sock juice\nand far more expensive to acquire.\nThey are the gustatory equivalent\nof a butchered pig\u2019s dying wail.\nThey taste like the tears of a bitter,\nimpotent man, and if you ask me\nhow I know what that tastes like\nI can tell you I know because I\u2019ve\ntasted ales, and there\u2019s no doubt in\nmy mind it\u2019s the same flavour.\nAnd they ruin nights out!\nSpecifically, mine. Every once in\na while, a friend will offer to get a\nround and bring me a pint of ale,\neven though pouring that swill on\nmy trousers and pretending I\u2019ve\npissed myself is a source of more\nenjoyment for me and everyone\naround me.\nI\u2019m not even safe if I order other\nbeers, as there\u2019s been this perfidious\ntrend of \u201ccraft lagers\u201d, which are just\nales trying to escape the curse of\ntheir name. And on those occasions\nthat I\u2019m tricked into drinking an ale,\nmy taste buds will be tainted for the\nrest of the evening, distorting every\nflavour afterwards and ruining beers\nthat had no crime other than being\ndrunk after spider-infested mildew.\nIn most bars, there will be several\n\u2013 too many \u2013 ales on tap, despite\nthe fact that the selection is like\nchoosing between different puddles\nof rainwater on a muddy road\nleading to a horse crematorium. To\nsomeone who hasn\u2019t acquired the\ntaste for slightly acrid windshield\ncondensation, the only options\navailable are the usual suspects of\nHeineken, Stella and Fosters, but\neven their bland,uninspiring flavour\nis a godsend if I get to avoid having\nan ale.\nThey taste\nlike the tears\nof a bitter,\nimpotent\nman\nAt this point you may say, it\u2019s just\na matter of taste. And yes, that is\ncompletely true:I don\u2019t like ales.And\nit\u2019s not for lack of trying. On more\nthan one occasion I\u2019ve thought to\nmyself,\u201cMillions of people like ales:\nthey can\u2019t all be wrong. Now you\u2019re\ngonna get yourself an ale, and you\u2019re\ngonna enjoy it.\u201d Then I got myself\nan ale, and I didn\u2019t enjoy it. I could\nleave it be, but for every round that\nhas been ruined for me by a damp\nloincloth rinsing, for every night\nI\u2019ve been forced to stay on Carlsberg\nfor four pints, I ask of you, I beg of\nyou, English people, cease this love\naffair with tepid backwash spat out\nby a coffee addict.\nI\u2019m real happy for you, people\nwho love ales and can somehow\nfind joy in them. I just hope that\nyou never have something that\nactually tastes better, like Erdinger,\nor Hoegarden, or Blue Moon, or,\ngods forbid, Chimay, or literally\nany lager ever made; I fear that the\nsuperior flavour might just destroy\nyour poor inexperienced tongue and\nmake your head explode for all the\nyears you could\u2019ve been having good\nalcohol instead of watered down\nmosquito distillate.\nFor the rest of us who aren\u2019t\nliving in a perpetual Stockholm\nsyndrome from pulped corrugated\ncarton fluid, please stop being so\nmuch in love with ales. It\u2019s making\nme legitimately concerned for you,\nand, more importantly, limiting my\nchoices at the pub. Please.\nYou can have an ale every once in a\nwhile if you want to remind yourself\nthat we live in an uncaring world of\nstrife and misery, but, on most days,\nstick to drinkable liquids. Life\u2019s too\nshort to spend it on ales.\nThere\u2019s\nbeen this\nperfidious\ntrend of\n\u201ccraft lagers\u201d\n\n"

I try, like I\u2019m\nsure most of you do,\nbut there are grey\nareas for me.Food can contain many\nof them. Like all transcendental\nideas, it is sometimes easiest to\nsimply pick and choose them as you\nlike, but when they tie in to the very\nsubstance we consume every day\n(out of pleasure or necessity \u2013 but\nthat\u2019s another thing entirely), I try\nto adopt a more rigid line: I will eat\nanything, as long as no unnecessary\nsuffering was caused to provide it.\nI can already hear the carrots\nbeing sharpened as the dozens\nof vegans from around Imperial\nlaunch to brand me an abuser of\nmy stewardship of the planet, a\nbastard, or even worse a sadistic\nanimal slaughterer. But relax! This\nisn\u2019t aimed at you \u2013 it\u2019s addressed to\nall those who eat meat, be it fish or\nflesh, and do not have the stomach\n(heh) to participate in, or worse\nacknowledge, the production of so\nmuch of what we eat.

I had to make the\nchoice myself, when I pulled the\ntrigger or broke the neck. Why\nshould you feel better for passing\nthat on to someone else, and then\nenjoying the end result nonetheless!\nBesides, as barmy as it can sound,\nyou experience a great attachment\nto any creature when you take its life\n\u2013 something quite spiritual, as it\u2019s a\ngreat honour to be able to.\nStill, I can understand people\u2019s\nreservations,as we didn\u2019t all grow up\nsurrounded by life and death, other\nthan the family pets. I certainly\ndidn\u2019t. Born to a family in the\nsuburbs, we stayed there. When\nwe did make trips to the coast\nfor holidays, fishing was seen as a\npleasant (or not) way to read a book,\nwith little intent to actually catch\nanything, let alone have to kill it.\nMy father, raised as a (semi-)devout\nHindu, still struggles to kill fish to\nthis day \u2013 and I admire that he sticks\nto his morals. Somehow, my parents\npassed on none of that to me \u2013 I\nwill happily end the brief suffering\nof a hooked fish or a downed bird,as\nlong as I can feel safe in saying that\nthe most will be made from it. For\nexample, I would never kill a non-edible species without a very good\ncause, as what\u2019s in it for me?\nIf you\u2019re not going to kill the beast,\nyou should at least appreciate what\nit is. This is an issue that has been\nfocused on by so many \u2013 that people\nare disconnected between pigs in a\npen, and pork in a packet. This, for\nme, is the most woeful dishonesty\nto yourself. If you\u2019re going to\nconsume meat, you need to accept\nwhere it came from \u2013 a real, living,\nbreathing animal that was killed and\nbutchered. The conditions animals\nare raised and are slaughtered in can\nvary massively, but I think that\u2019s an\narticle for next week.\nSo please,the next time you wax on\nabout how cruel or savage hunters\nare, just remember \u2013 if you want to\neat meat,an animal will have to die.*\nWhy not just do it yourself?\n*obviously, this ignores lab-grown\nmeat.

It was directed\nat my very recent ex-boyfriend, and in it I attempted to\nverbalise the pain I felt and some\nof the things I realised in the wake\nof our breakup. It wasn\u2019t something\nthat I wrote originally with the\nintention of publishing it in FELIX,\nbut for me, the act of editing it for\npublication and seeing it printed\nwas incredibly cathartic.\nAfter FELIX hit the campus\non the Friday morning, I started\nto receive messages. Messages of\nconcern, messages of admiration,\nbut overwhelmingly, messages\ntelling me that I shouldn\u2019t have\npublished it, or at the very least,\ntelling me that I shouldn\u2019t have\nput my name to it. It wasn\u2019t, I was\nrepeatedly told, appropriate to air\nmy feelings so publicly. Personal\nmatters, it was emphasised, should\nbe kept private.\nThis sentiment is not one shared\nby Beyonc\u00e9. In Lemonade, Beyonc\u00e9\nshows us the very raw emotion\nMessages\ntelling\nme that I\nshouldn\u2019t\nhave\npublished it What\u2019s worse, lookin\u2019 jealous or crazy? Photo Credit: Beyonc\u00e9\nof marriage post-infidelity. Many\npeople are calling it a publicity\nstunt, or saying that it isn\u2019t real.\nWhile that may be true, why is it so\nhard to believe that a woman would\nstand up and say that her heart has\nbeen broken?\nAs women, we are socialised to\nmask any pain that we experience.\nWomen are taught that if they show\nfeelings, you look crazy. We are\nexpected to stay silent and apologise\nfor every emotion that escapes us,\nbecause surely we must be the ones\nwho are at fault. We are told that\nto be successful we must only show\nThere is as much dignity in being honest as in staying silent\nShe is my\nqueen\nthe aspirational aspects of our lives.\nEven positive sentiments, such as\nthe ones expressed in my letter, can\nbe lost in the discomfort caused by\nbeing upfront.\nBeyonc\u00e9 shows us that it is\nnot undignified to feel. Whether\nLemonade is about her life, her\nmother\u2019s, or any one of the billions\nof heartbroken women throughout\nhistory, Beyonc\u00e9 is acknowledging\nthe pain and anger that is felt by\nwomen but so often dismissed.\nAs well as the beautifully lit,\nfiltered images we post on Facebook\nto advertise our lives, there are real,\nmessy emotions, which we should\nnot have to apologise for. Beyonc\u00e9 is\nowning her emotions, and handling\nthem with absolute dignity. She is\nan inspiration to all women who\nare made to feel ashamed of their\nfeelings, and for that, she is my\nqueen.\nGiacomo Boscaini-Gilroy\nWriter\nThe NUS doesn\u2019t represent Jewish students\nO\nn Wednesday 20th\nApril,\nthe NUS voted in Malia\nBouattia as the first\nfemale black Muslim\npresident. It is great that at a time\nwhen Islamophobia is increasing\nand London mayoral candidate\nSadiq Khan is pettily attacked\nover past acquaintances, the largest\nstudent body stands together\nwith it\u2019s minorities by celebrating\ndiversity, voting in someone with\nimmense life experience in wartime\ntroubles.\nHowever, the Jewish community\nis fearful. In fact, our own Jewish\nSociety co-presidents were two of\nthe signatories of an open letter\nbringing past comments made by\nBouattia into question. The letter\u2019s\naccusations did not convince me\nthat Bouattia is anti-Semitic, but\nthey were a worry that needed\naddressing. It is beyond dodgy to\ncall the University of Birmingham a\n\u201cZionist outpost\u201d because there are\na large number of Jews.\nThe comments were made several\nyearsago,soifBouattiaacceptedthat\nshe expressed herself badly, I would\nlet it go.However,it is disconcerting\nthat her first reply on twitter was\nunconvincing and defensive. If the\nNUS president truly understood the\nJewish community, she would have\nused a reassuring tone. However,\nrather than accept that many of the\nstudents that she will represent are\npro-Israel, she defended her right to\ndisagree with them.\nIt irritates me that she falsely\nclaimed that her faith is being used\nas \u201can opportunity\u201d to accuse her of\nanti-Semitism. The allegations are\nlegitimate,no matter whether or not\nshe is Muslim.\nWhat is perhaps more shocking\nis that Bouattia believes that think-tank The Henry Jackson Society\nshould not have influence over\npolicy making in the UK because\nit is \u201cpro-Zionist\u201d. It does not\neven identify as Zionist. I can only\nassume that she thinks that the only\nthink-tanks that should be allowed\nto promote policy are the ones in\nline with her opinions.\nTo the successful candidate\u2019s\ncredit, she has since written a more\nreconciliatory piece for the Guardian\nsaying she would take back these\nwords if necessary.\nI believe the controversy boils\ndown to the fact that many young\nMalia Bouattia needs to accept\nthat some will disagree with her\nVirulently\nanti-Zionist?\nReally?\nJews do not feel represented by the\nNUS. The issue goes further than\nthis,because plenty of other students\ndo not fit into NUS ideology either.\nThis is a reason why Imperial\ndisaffiliated in 2008.There are many\nright-leaning students out there,\nand their opinions are not reflected\nin the radically left-wing union that\nstands up for them. You could argue\nthat Conservative government is\nbad for British further education,\nso a student organisation might be\njustified in speaking out against it,\nbut virulently anti-Zionist? Really?\nTo end on a positive, I am uplifted\nby those youth leaders,such as Rabbi\nLeah Jordan, student chaplain at\nLiberal Judaism, who are aware of\nthe precarious situation and who\nare ready to work with the new\npresident to ensure she understands\nwhat Jewish people expect of her.\nMalia Bouattia said she has already\nheld a meeting with the Union of\nJewish Students, so progress is\ncertainly possible.\nCheck your privilege\nIt\u2019s time to recognise that it\u2019s not an expression\nof your freedom of speech to make jokes about\nmarginalised parties\nSimran Kukran\nWriter\nYAS QUEEN! Photo Credit: Imperial College London\nT\nhis piece is something of\na sequel \u2013 the aftermath\nof a Women@Imperial\nweek interview in\nFELIX about a month ago. I spoke\nabout my experience at Imperial as\na woman of colour, my reaction to\nsexist comments that were made\nas \u201cjokes\u201d, as well as the issue of\ngendered insults, particularly when\nit comes to female lecturers. I\ndid this so I could tell those that\nparticipated that it was not okay. It\ndidn\u2019t work.\nEncouragingly, the department\nreacted well; there were discussions\nabout the topic in the student-staff\ncommitteemeeting,andourclassrep\nsent an email asking anybody who\nfelt as if they\u2019d been marginalised\nto report it. The issue was more to\ndo with ignorant behaviour and\ncomments being normalised and\naccepted, but the recognition of it\u2019s\nexistence was a start. In any case,\nthe email didn\u2019t go down very well\nwith many people \u2013 they reacted by\nmaking jokes about marginalisation,\nwhich have continued even since\nI\u2019ve made it clear I did not like them.\nI\u2019m still not sure whether\nthese comments were sarcastic\nor ignorant, or maybe a bit of\nboth. Generally, I think it comes\nfrom a misunderstanding of what\nmarginalisation is, the effects it\nhas, or the fact that it is subtle\nand pervasive. To understand\nmarginalisation, we need to\nunderstand privilege.\nWhat does it mean to be a\nminority? From a young age we\nconsume images of \u201csuccessful\npeople\u201d from every field, and\nthe default person represents an\nunrepresentative sample. In Britain,\nthese are usually white males from\nthe Home Counties, because even\naccent plays a role in perception.\nSomebody speaking the Queen\u2019s\nEnglish comes across as intelligent\nand well-reasoned, while Essex\naccents are seen as \u201cchavvy\u201d. Having\na European accent of any kind is\ninteresting and sounds \u201ccultured\u201d,\nbut Asian or African accents are\nmocked. This is just one small\nexample of how privilege affects the\nway you are perceived.\nHow does privilege manifest\nitself? Getting to Imperial can\nbe considered to be the result of\nprivilege. The way your family\nencouraged you, even passively, by\nbeing a certain class. The school\nthat you went to, and the support\nyou had is all a privilege, and not\nsomething that everybody gets to\nexperience, which limits access to\nthings. This happens to different\nextents for different people, and it\nis important to remember that we\nare not on a level playing field. Not\neverybody is lucky enough to have\na smooth path to university, or to\nget a second chance if there was\nadversity along the way. (Shout out\nto Materials Dept, I appreciate it).\nIt\u2019s difficult to accept the fact that\nour successes may not be entirely\ndown to personal responsibility, and\nare more a product of circumstance.\nThey are only slightly due to hard\nwork, and are mainly a result of\nliving in a privileged world. I\u2019m\nnot saying that you should give\nup all your privileges, or that a\nprivileged person is not worthy of\ntheir successes. What I am saying is\nthat you should acknowledge your\nprivilege, and understand you are\nnot better than somebody who is\ndisadvantaged.\nPerhaps if this was considered,\npeople would understand why\njokes about suicide, disability,\nAIDS, socioeconomic background,\nor race are not okay if made by an\nuninformed privileged observer.\nWhy having a \u201cslave auction\u201d\nfor fun is twisted, or why \u201cjokes\u201d\nabout women making sandwiches\nare sickening. If your \u201cjokes\u201d are\ntrivialising or laughing at a struggle\nthat is not your own, they are not\nfunny. Jokes like this foster a culture\nwhere disadvantage, prejudice and\ninequality are made light of,and can\ncontinue.\nRefusing to recognise the effect of\nprivilege and how it disadvantages\npeople, and exacerbating it with\nignorant comments, leads to entire\ngroups of people being made to\nbelieve their contributions are not\nimportant or necessary. That is\nmarginalisation.\nIdeally, just saying this would be\nenough to open the eyes of those\nthat don\u2019t believe they were ever\nwrong, misinformed or ignorant\nabout anything. People would\nunderstand why it is important\nto be empathetic towards others,\nand would stop talking over other\npeople. Regardless of any social\nawareness, wouldn\u2019t this just be\ngood sense?\nI wish that people would enjoy\nsupporting and helping others when\nthey can, rather than tearing them\ndown for fun. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t\nbelieve that\u2019s the case, and a few\npeople will actually be encouraged\nwhen they see people react adversely\nto offensive comments; they thrive\noff being \u201coutrageous\u201d. When\nthey are actually criticised for\nthis behaviour, they will play the\nvictim and say that they are being\nconstrained.\nSaying that these \u201cjokes\u201d are\nunacceptable is not a restriction\nof your freedom of speech, it\u2019s an\nexpression of mine.\nOur\nsuccesses\nmay not\nbe down\nto personal\nresponsibility\nIt\u2019s not just Imperial that has a problem.

While that\nmay not be true in life all the\ntime, in photography at least,\nintroducing a new observer to a tired\nscene can definitely produce some\nfresh perspectives. It is with this\nnotion that British photographer\nMartin Parr curates Strange and\nFamiliar: Britain as Revealed by\nInternational Photographers, a\nphotography exhibition of British\nsubjects by foreign photographers.\nKnown for his work scrutinising all\nmanner of British clich\u00e9s, Parr now\nturns his attention to what Britain\nmight look like to an outsider.\nThe exhibition held special\nsignificance for me, as a foreigner\nand an amateur photographer.\nWhen I first stepped into the UK\nin 2006, and then again in 2011, the\nkind of pictures I took with my then\ncamera (a compact \u2013 how quaint!)\nwere of all the things I now find\nabsolutely quotidian, having lived\nhere for three years. Red telephone\nboxes, pub signs, tubes pulling into\nthe station, squirrels in Hyde Park\n\u2013 these are things that now go as\nunnoticed as queueing up on the\nright on escalators.\nIn a similar vein, the selected\npictures show us a side of Britain\nfrom an outsider\u2019s perspective,\ndrawing our attention to the little\nquirks of British life that we so\noften overlook and corners that we\nneglect to acknowledge.\nFor example, American\nphotographer Bruce Davidson had\na keen interest in photographing\ncommonplace things that were\nrepresentative to foreigners, such\nas formal dress codes and British\nstoicism \u2013 things locals would\nhardly bat an eyelid to. Yet, his\npicture of women having tea in a\ncar (pouring it into teacups from\na thermos flask) and another of\ncouples basking on the beach in\nformal dress encapsulate so much of\nwhat is unique to British culture.\nTwenty-three international\nphotographers are featured in the\nexhibition, all of whom travelled to\nStrange and Familiar is a unique take on the British way of life. Photo Credit: Barbican Art Gallery\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nThe\npictures\ndraw our\nattention\nto the little\nquirks of\nBritish life\nGreat Britain, strange yet familiar\nMartin Parr brings together pictures of Britain as seen through outsiders\u2019 lenses\nBritain for varying lengths of time\nspanning the 1930s to the present\nday. Some, like Cas Oorthuys, were\nhere briefly with an express mission\nto capture the character of British\ncities, while others, like Edith\nTudor-Hart,eventually married and\nsettled in the country.\nShinro Ohtake on the other hand,\na 22-year-old scrapbook enthusiast\nwho had never previously been out\nof Japan and spoke no English,\ncame to the UK to document the\nexperiences of a transient traveller.\nWhat he produced was a body\nof work almost like a stream-of-consciousness observation of his\nperegrinations through various\nBritish towns and cities.\nIt is precisely the varied\nexperiences and purposes of the\nphotographers featured that made\nthe exhibition interesting. Laid out\nacross two floors, the photographs\nare arranged in chronological order,\neach individual photographer\u2019s\nbody of work getting a section to\nitself. While some common themes\nran through the exhibition, no two\nphotographers were the same.\nAkihiko Okamura dedicated\nhimself to documenting conflict in\nNorthern Ireland, and on display\nis an almost matter-of-fact look at\nthe sense of ordinary lives disrupted.\nGian Butturini and Frank Habicht\nproduced work that looked at the\nsexual freedom and psychedelic\noptimism that permeated London\u2019s\nyouth culture in the 1960s \u2013 the\nlatter\u2019s book \u201cYoung London:\nPermissive Paradise\u201d is on display in\na nearby case.\nWhile the older photographs\ngive a more general take on Britain,\nthe more recent works seem to\nfocus on one or another aspect of\nlife in particular. One of the more\nmemorable projects is American\nphotographer Jim Dow\u2019s Corner\nShops of Britain (1994), the result of\nhis fascination with local vernacular\narchitecture and their uncertain\nfuture. He photographs the shop\nfronts in taxonomical detail, and\nthey are printed on large, richly\ncoloured canvases. There is a sense\nthat it is only with his outsider\u2019s\neye that the unique historical and\ncultural value of the British family-run corner shop is highlighted and\ndocumented for posterity.\nStrange and Familiar is a\ndelightful romp through the history\nof Britain in the last century as seen\nthrough foreign eyes. Although it\nis made up of a patchwork of very\ndifferent perspectives, the vignettes\ncome together beautifully to tell the\nstory of what it means to be British.\nStrange and Familiar is on at the\nBarbican Art Gallery until 19 June.\nAn elderly gentleman blows bubbles in London, 1953.

She is\nalso a Muslim.\nThe tabloid news has been quick\nto demonise Bouattia. Two years\nago, she delayed a NUS motion\ncondemning ISIS to change\nthe wording. In a piece for The\nGuardian, she says the paper\u2019s\nmotion appeared to \u201ccondemn all\nMuslims, not just the terror group\u201d.\nAfter changes, the motion passed\nwith her support.\nThere have been accusations from\nthe mainstream media, students,\nincluding Jewish Societies from\naround the country, accusing her of\nanti-semitism. A two year old video\nof her making a reference to the\n\u201cZionist-led media\u201d, and an article\nin which she calls Birmingham\nuniversity \u201csomething of a Zionist\noutpost\u201d have not helped her\ncampaign. Bouattia has since\nmaintained that her problems with\npolitical Zionism should not be\nconfused with anti-semitism.\nMembers of Imperial College\nUnion\u2019s own Jewish Society signed\na letter addressed to Bouattia before\nher win, asking her to clarify why\nshe saw a large Jewish population\n\u201cas a problem\u201d.\nIn attempt to prove the critics\nwrong, as soon as she was elected\nshe held a meeting with the Union\nof Jewish students, and has said she\nwill continue to work to show she is\nnot anti-semitic.\nMany have pointed to the media\nuproar concerning her election as an\nexample of Islamophobia.\nImperial is not currently a member\nof the NUS, and has a tempestuous\nhistory with the nationwide\nstudents\u2019 union.\nMalia Bouattia is their first female black Muslim leader\nICU has left\nthe NUS a\nwhopping six\ntimes\nDespite being a founding member\nwhen the organisation began in\n1922, ICU has left a whopping six\ntimes.\nThe college was a member for\na number of years, despite several\nreferendums at to whether we\nshould stay. In 2010, we voted to\nleave and stop paying the \u00a340,000 a\nyear subscription fee.\nDespite receiving some bad\npress in recent years, the NUS\nwas responsible for much of the\nlobbying that led to council tax\nexemption for students and the\nlowering the voting age to 18 as\nwell as spearheading a Barclays\nboycott to protest its involvement in\napartheid South Africa.\nLet\u2019s start our own NUS with blackjack and hookers! Photo Credit: NUS\nM\nany of us suspect that\nImperial\u2019s concerned\nmore with its image\nthan ever before, and\nnow it has hired a \u2018Vice President\nfor Communications and public\naffairs\u2019. From September the new\npost will join the highest managers\nat Imperial, including the VPs for\nAdvancement and Innovation.\nThere is no doubt that successful\nPR is needed to secure valuable\nfunding for research, improving the\nuniversity buildings and equipment,\nas well as providing for student\nbursary funds.\nAlice Gast, Imperial\u2019s President,\nsaid it was necessary to \u201cforge\nconnections across disciplines,\ninstitutions and borders\u201d and to\ndo this we need \u201cexcellent and\nthoughtful communications\u201d. Upon\nhis appointment, Blair said that\nImperial had a \u201csimply amazing\nbrand\u201d.\nImperial\u2019s name and branding\nchanged in 2010 from a more\ntraditional crest to the current blue\n\u2018Imperial College London\u2019 logo.\nBefore crossing over to PR, Blair\nwas a political correspondent at the\nEvening Standard. Now, at the top\nof his field, he is part of the London\nCommunications Agency and has\ncommanded over communications\nfor parts of the NHS, TfL and the\nImperial appoints new VP for communications\nEx-journalist, Luke Blair, will be in charge of the college\u2019s PR machine\nBlair said\nthat Imperial\nhad a\n\u201csimply\namazing\nbrand\u201d\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nFictional head of communications, Malcolm Tucker.

Muslims were interviewed\nin areas where a minimum of 20%\nof the population practice Islam,\nwhich are also home to some\nof the poorest and religiously\nconservative Muslim families. This\narguably isn\u2019t a representative view\nof Muslims living throughout the\nUK. The control group given the\nsame questions were also only\ninterviewed on the phone, rather\nthan face to face.One of the most\nmisleading answers was that about\nreporting terrorism. Although 34%\nof Muslims said they would report\nsomeone to the police who they\nknew was involved with people who\nsupported terrorism in Syria, this\nfigure was only 30% in the control\ngroup. Despite this, Philips called\nthe stat \u201calarming\u201d.\nOthers have commented that any\nvery religious groups, including\nOrthodox Jews or Catholics, would\nlikely have similar opinions on\nhomosexuality and separatism.\nTrevor Philips did a Chemistry\ndegree at Imperial before becoming\nICU President in 1974. He\nlater headed up the NUS before\nbecoming a TV researcher. After\nstints in the volunteer sector and a\nposition on the London Assembly\nfor Labour, Philips became the\nchair of the Equality and Human\nRights Commission.\nIn 2007, he was awarded\nImperial\u2019s \u201chighest honour\u201d by\nbeing admitted to the Fellowship\nof Imperial College London during\nthe Postgraduate Graduation at the\nRoyal Albert Hall. This was whilst\nhe was chair of the Commission for\nEquality and Human Rights.\nIn an interview with the college\nfor its alumni webpage, he said\nthat after graduating he was told\nby a graduate employer: \u201cGet real.\nRadical leftie. Black. And let\u2019s be\nhonest,not really much of a chemist.\nWe can see trouble coming, and\nyou\u2019ve got it written all over you.Try\nsomething else\u201d.\nPhilips has long spoke out against\nmulticulturalism, so much so that\nthe London mayor at the time, Ken\nLivingstone, accused him of being\nso right-wing that he \u201cwould soon\njoin the BNP\u201d.\nHe has also previously spoken\nat Imperial as part of its Diversity\nLecture series, which aims to\npromote \u201cknowledge,awareness and\nunderstanding\u201d of diversity.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nAny first year statistician would think this poll was dodgy.

If\nFELIX doesn\u2019t do this or breaks\nthis rule in any way, the candidate\nthemselves (rather than FELIX)\nwill be punished. This could mean\na temporary campaign ban, a\nreduction in campaign budget or a\nwithdrawal of the candidate from\nthe elections.\nAny kind of perceived\nendorsements within FELIX are\nbanned, however, other sabbatical\nofficersarefreetoendorsecandidates\non their own social media pages, as\nwas seen during this year\u2019s elections.\nWe weren\u2019t allowed to print this\npicture we drew as part of last term\u2019s\nelection coverage as the union said\nit endorsed one of the candidates.\nPhoto Credit: FELIX\n\n"

Tshembe, the protagonist, is a black intellectual, the son of a revolutionary who\nhas been living in England. The play is an exploration of the cost, and the joy of revolution for a state, and a\nfamily, both in the process of carving out an independent identity. Les Blancs marks the National Theatre debut\nof the multi-award-winning director Ya\u00ebl Farber, whose productions include The Crucible (Old Vic) and the\ninternationally-acclaimed Mies Julie and Nirbhaya.Tickets from \u00a35 with NT Entry Pass.\nLes Blancs at the National Theatre now until 2nd\nJune\nIn a luxurious bedroom, two maids played by Uzo Abuda (Orange Is The New Black) and Zawe Ashton\n(Fresh Meat) fantasize about killing their employer, Mistress, played by Laura Carmichael (Downton Abbey),\nwhom they both despise and love. Whilst she is away they plot and play-act increasingly violent scenarios\nin which they ritualistically kill her. The Maids is the translation from the French - Les Bonnes by the French\ndramatist Jean Genet. In director Jamie Lloyd\u2019s production, the play seethes with the anger of the oppressed,\nand in an incisive psychological thriller skewers the class system and race politics. In particular, Uzo Abuda\u2019s\nperformance of Solange has been critically acclaimed as a performance of searing ferocity.Tickets from \u00a315.\nThe Maids at Trafalgar Studios now until 21th\nMay\nSpanning 75 years across the Victorian and Edwardian ages, Painting with Light celebrates the dialogue\nbetween early photography and traditional painting. Pre-Raphaelite, Aesthetic, and British impressionist\nworks by Whistler, Turner and others are shown together with the work of pioneering photographers, such\nas Julia Margaret Cameron, who inspired and were inspired by them. In a series of stunning juxtapositions\nwe see how photographers and painters borrowed from each other and inspired each other to reach greater\nheights in their work. A must-see for those interested in the ways artists use tone, light and shade to create\nstriking work during this nascent period for photography as an art form.Tickets from \u00a314.50.\nPainting with Light at Tate Britain 11th\nMay - 25th\nSeptember\nThis often neglected George Enescu opera, acclaimed as one of the finest works of the 20th\ncentury but\nsporadically performed since it\u2019s 1936 debut, is revived by the Catalan theatre group La Fura dels Baus (Le\nGrand Macabre, ENO). The story is an adaptation of Sophocle\u2019s Athenian tragedy Oedipus tyrannus, telling\nthe tale of a man who inadvertently murders his father and marries his mother in an attempt to escape that\nsame fate. The present staging takes place in a post-apocalyptic world rooted in mud and clay. The stripped\nbare production, monochrome in design but lavish in scale, allows the score to soar.Tickets from \u00a317.\nOedipe at the Royal Opera House 23th\nMay - 8th\nJune\nThe 1960s was a decade in which British artists began put ideas and issues at the centre of their work,rather\nthan more traditional representative approaches. Many of the artists featured, including Michael CraigMartin, Margaret Harrison, John Latham, Conrad Atkinson and Keith Arnatt, pushed the boundaries of\nwhat of what art could be; their innovation still informs the way we think of art. In particular, these artists\nwere interested in what impact their art could have outside of exhibitions and studios, and whether artistic\noutput could have an influence in how society viewed itself.The result was art that engaged in the politics and\nsocial reform of its time, from feminism to conflict in Northern Ireland.Tickets from \u00a39.50.\nConceptual Art in Britain 1964\u20131979 at Tate Britain\nnow until 29th\nAugust\nThe State Tretyakov Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery,both celebrating their 160th\nanniversaries this\nyear, have staged this exhibition as part of a cultural exchange. The London exhibition showcases paintings\nof Russian artists, philosophers, composers, writers and actors spanning 1867-1914, highlighting an artistic\ngolden age for the nation. Many of these paintings have never been seen outside Russia - thus this exhibition\nis a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.The 30 paintings on show include portraits of Tolstoy shown in the study\nof his Moscow home working on manuscripts, the composer Mussorgsky, and an introspective portrait of\nDostoevsky.The exhibition also showcases the works of some of the best Russian artists including Vasily Perov\nand Ilya Repin.Tickets from \u00a34.\nRussia and the Arts at the National Portrait Gallery\nnow until 26th\nJune\nhot in art this term\nThis interactive installation invites visitors to add their portrait and their voice to an evolving work.Designed\nby Marianne Holm Hansen in association with Seth Scott, and electronic musicians from the Guildhall\nSchool, this installation acts as a response to the Martin Parr exhibition Strange and Familiar (see review)\nwhich is already running at the Barbican.The installation aims to create a tangible representation of national\nidentity in a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, and globalised world.The portraits and voices of the visitors will be\nmanipulated into an evolving British \u2018average\u2019.This is an opportunity to not just view art, but become involved\nin the process of creating conceptual, thought-provoking artwork. Free.\nTowards the Mean: Sampling Britishness Today at Barbican\nnow until 19th\nJune\nThis is Royal Ballet\u2019s Artist in Residence Liam Scarlett\u2019s first full-length work for the main stage.With music\nby Lowell Liebermann, this adaptation strips away the decades of horror movie associations with the gothic\ntale to take a fresh, sympathetic view of the relationships between Victor Frankenstein, his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth,\nand the Creature he created. In particular, Scarlett aims to do more than dismiss the Creature as the cardboard\ncut-out villain portrayed in past productions. In the three-act piece he will explore themes of betrayal, revenge,\nand acceptance, promising that by the end, we as the audience will be torn as to where our loyalties lie.Tickets\nfrom \u00a327.\nFrankenstein at The Royal Opera House 4th\nMay - 27th\nMay\nExam season is just another excuse to get out and de-stress with the great shows on offer this term\n\n"

The\n\u2018visual album\u2019, directed by seven\ndirectors including Kahlil Joseph\n(Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u2018m.A.A.d\u2019), and\nMelina Matsoukas (\u2018Pretty Hurts\u2019,\n\u2018Formation\u2019) is something special.\nBeyonc\u00e9 has previously spoken\nabout her habit of rooting her songs\nin imagery throughout the creative\nprocess, and in Lemonade she has\ncreated music to be watched.\nIt is not just visuals; spoken\nword also informs the experience\nof listening to Lemonade. In\n\u2018Formation\u2019, released earlier this\nyear, Messy Mya, and Big Freedia\nvoice clips provided punctuation to\nthe melody, in Lemonade, Beyonc\u00e9\nevolves the concept by reading\npoetry written for the album by the\nSomali-British poet Warsan Shire\n(London\u2019s Young Poet Laureate)\ninterspersed with the songs.\nThe album is stunningly\nambitious. Just as the camera\nseamlessly shifts from bayous, to\ndrowned mansions, to downtown\nNew Orleans, to underground car-parks, vast plantations, weaving\nthrough the urban and rural Deep\nSouth, so does the music. Twelve\nsongs, split into chapters which\nstage the unravelling of a marriage,\neffortlessly skip through genres:\nfrom rap, to soulful ballad, by way\nof country, and dance. In lesser\nhands, it might have come across\n\u2018Don\u2019t Hurt Yourself\u2019 which is raw,\nrap heavy, and rage fuelled; \u20186 Inch\u2019,\na collaboration with The Weeknd,\nis gritty and layered; James Blake\naccompanies Beyonc\u00e9 in a short\nlyrical ballad; and in \u2018Freedom\u2019,\none of the last songs of the album,\nKendrick Lamar stars in a song that\ncould easily be a bonus track on To\nPimp a Butterfly.\nOn the surface,Lemonade is a very\nspecific, seemingly autobiographical\nnarrative of a marriage under strain\nof secrets and betrayal. Her lyrics,\nwhich specifically reference Jay Z,\n(\u201cBig homie better grow up\u201d) and\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of home videos in the\nfilm, seems to lend credence to the\nrumours of Jay Z\u2019s affair that have\ncircled ever since 2014, when her\nsister, Solange, attacked Jay Z in an\nelevator at the Met Gala.\nLook a bit deeper, however,\nand Lemonade is about a lot more\nthan infidelity. If \u2018Formation\u2019 is a\ncelebratory anthem of self-love for\nher identity as a black woman, the\nreward of self-acceptance and pride,\nLemonade charts the journey it took\nto get there.\nAt times, early in her career, with\nthe release of albums I am\u2026 Sasha\nFierce, 4, and even the 2013 hit\nBeyonc\u00e9, Beyonc\u00e9 was accused of\ndismissing her blackness, neatly\nsidestepping any attempt at political\nstance in favour of drawing in a\nwider, whiter, fan-base. \u201cI tried to\nchange / closed my mouth more\n/ tried to be softer / prettier / less\nawake\u201d, she confesses. As the album\nprogresses,she\u2019s done trying.\u201cI don\u2019t\ngive a fuck, chucking my deuces\nup / suck on my balls, pause, I had\nenough / I ain\u2019t thinking \u2018bout you\u201d,\nthe expletive laden line from \u2018Sorry\u2019\nis about a cheating man, but as well\ncould be about the mainstream\nviewers. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s message is clear:\nif you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m saying,feel\nfree to leave.\nIn \u2018Formation\u2019, Beyonc\u00e9 sang\nabout her love of her black features\n\u201cI like my baby heir with baby hair\nand afros / I like my negro nose with\nJackson Five nostrils\u201d, Lemonade\nreveals that such a declaration is not\nfree from a hinterland of hurt, and\ndoubt; featuring the fantastically\nshade-throwing line \u201cbetter call\nBecky with the good hair\u201d, using\nthe name \u2018Becky\u2019 as a shorthand for\n\u2018white woman\u2019 as she calls out her\nhusband for cheating on her. In a\nheart wrenching, chilling lyric that\nfollows, Beyonc\u00e9 tells her lover \u201cIf\nthis what you truly want, I can wear\nher skin\u2026 over mine / Her hair,\nover mine / Her hands as gloves /\nHer teeth as confetti\u201d. In doing so,\nshe articulates a sentiment that has\nbeen explored by many black artists\nbefore her. In a deeply moving\narticle, Jezebel\u2019s Clover Hope draws\nparallels between this line, and Toni\nMorrison\u2019s novel\u2018The Bluest Eye\u2019.In\nthe novel, a young black girl, Pecola,\nis continually told she is \u2018ugly\u2019, and\nwants more than anything to have a\npair of blue eyes so she can live up to\nthe white standards of beauty. Toni\nTime to join the Beyhive. Photo Credit: Beyonc\u00e9\n#slaaaaay. Photo Credit: Beyonc\u00e9\nissues. In Lemonade, Beyonc\u00e9 aligns\nherself with this self-doubt and\nthe pain and humiliation it carries,\nsinging \u201cI\u2019m not too perfect / to ever\nfeel this worthless\u201d.\nLemonade is a body of work\ndetermined to overthrow that\nmantle, not just from Beyonc\u00e9, but\nall black girls. The videos are filled\nwith black women, some faces more\nfamiliar than others. In \u2018Sorry\u2019,\nBeyonc\u00e9, in a head full of cornrows,\ndances on a bus with women in\nYoruba body paint, a celebration of\nthe African diaspora. In the same\nsong, whilst Beyonc\u00e9 reclines on a\nthrone,Serena Williams twerks next\nto her.There aren\u2019t many artists who\ncould inspire one of the greatest\nliving athletes in the world to twerk\nfor three minutes, but Beyonc\u00e9\nis one. Later, Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis\n(Beasts of the Southern Wild, Annie)\nappears with Blue Ivy, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s\ndaughter. Also present are actresses\nAmandla Stenberg (The Hunger\nGames), Zendaya, model Winnie\nHarlow, singers Chloe and Halle\nBailey. Ballet dancer Michaela\ndePrince performs beautifully to\n\u2018Freedom\u2019, even Leah Chase, the\n\u2018queen of Creole cooking\u2019, a New\nOrleans institution unto herself,\nmakes an appearance. Of course,\nWarsan Shire is ever-present, whose\nwords, evocative, punchy, and brave,\nsculpt the narrative throughout the\nalbum.\nThe most poignant appearances,\nhowever, are by Michael Brown\u2019s\nmother, Lesley McSpadden,\nTrayvon Martin\u2019s mother, Sabryna\nFulton, and Eric Garner\u2019s mother,\nGwen Carr, all holding portraits of\ntheir sons who were killed in acts\nof police brutality. They hold their\nheads up, and look defiantly into\nthe camera as Kendrick Lamar raps\n\u201cEight blocks left, death is around\nthe corner / Seven misleadin\u2019\nstatements \u2018bout my persona / Six\nheadlights wavin\u2019 in my direction\n/ Five-O askin\u2019 me what\u2019s in my\npossession\u2026 mama, don\u2019t cry for\nme, ride for me / Try for me, live for\nme / Breathe for me, sing for me\u201d.\nThe Malcolm X speech sampled\nearlier in the album, \u201cthe most\ndisrespected person in America\nis the black woman, the most\nunprotected person in America is\nthe black woman,the most neglected\nyour mother / you look everything\nlike your mother\u201d. Oppression is\ngenerational, \u201care you thankful /\nfor the hips that cracked, the deep\nvelvet of your mother / and her\nmother / and her mother / there\nis a curse that will be broken\u201d. The\ncamera pans to a Nina Simone\nrecord. The inference to be made\nis clear. Nina Simone, one of\nthe most incandescent talents of\nthe twentieth century, lived in a\nphysically abusive relationship with\nher second husband, a man who\nbeat her, held guns to her head, and\nthen laughed it off; her talent, her\nstrength, her charisma could not\nsave her from violence, from pain.\nIn Shire\u2019s poetry, men are\n\u201cmagicians, able to exist in two\nplaces at once\u201d, across generations,\nthey \u201ccome home at 3 AM, and lie\u201d,\nthey betray, disappoint. Those with\nreal magic are the women, cursed,\nand yet, able to save themselves;\n\u201cgrandmother, the alchemist / you\nspun gold out of this hard life /\nconjured beauty from the things left\nbehind / found healing where it did\nnot live / discovered the antidote in\nyour own kitchen / broke the curse\nwith your own two hands\u201d. The\ncamera cuts to a home video of Jay\nZ\u2019s grandmother, Hattie White\u2019s,\n90th\nbirthday. \u201cI had my up and\ndowns,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I found the\ninner strength to get back up. Life\nhanded me lemons, but I made\nlemonade\u201d.\nLemonade, plantations, southern\ngothic, cowboys, shotguns, seedy\nstreets in New Orleans, churches,\nparades; these are all images rooted\nin the cultural landscape of the\nDeep South. In Lemonade, this\nlandscape is populated with black\nwomen surviving, thriving in a life\nthat keeps handing them lemons;\nthey keep making lemonade. This\nis Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s love letter to these\nas confused, but Lemonade is tightly\nstrung and expertly cohesive.\nIn one of the first songs, \u2018Hold\nUp\u2019, Beyonc\u00e9 throws open the doors\nto a courthouse, emerging arms\noutstretched, resplendent in yellow\nfrills, floodwaters cascading around\nher down the steps, Botticelli\u2019s\n\u2018The Birth of Venus\u2019 made flesh.\nShe struts down a downtown street\nswinging a baseball bat named\n\u2018Hotsauce\u2019, murderous smile fixed,\nsmashing classic cars. The song,\nwith writing credits as varied as\nVampire Weekend\u2019s Ezra Koenig,\nMNEK, and Father John Misty,\nborrows heavily from The Yeah\nYeah Yeahs\u2019 \u2018Maps\u2019; and Soulja\nBoy\u2019s \u2018Get My Swag On\u2019. What\nresults is a catchy song with a\ndistinct reggae twist, reminiscent\nof Rihanna\u2019s \u2018Man Down\u2019. From\nthis, we are launched into a series\nof songs which sample everything\nwomen, to their whole selves; to\ntheir anger, their joy, their love, their\ntalent, their magic, their beauty, and\nabove all, their resilience.\nBeyonc\u00e9 has sung about girl power\nbefore. \u2018Irreplaceable\u2019, \u2018Independent\nWoman\u2019, and \u2018Run the World\n(Girls)\u2019 come of age as \u2018Don\u2019t Hurt\nYourself\u2019: \u201cI\u2019m a fire breathing\ndragon / Beautiful mane, I\u2019m the\nlion\u201d, \u201ckeep your money, I got my\nown / Get a bigger smile on my face,\nbeing alone / Bad motherfucker,\nGod complex\u201d.\nThe world is waking up to the\nreality of Beyonc\u00e9 as a black artist,\nan experience skewered brilliantly\nin a recent SNL skit. Of course, she\nhas always been black, but like so\nmany minority women, she diluted\nher blackness to fit into the cookie\ncutter mould society expected\nher fit, in order to succeed. Nina\nSimone sang \u201cI wish I could break\n/ All the chains holdin\u2019 me / I wish\nI could say / All the things that I\nshould say / Say \u2018em loud say \u2018em\nclear / For the whole \u2018round world\nto hear\u201d and this Beyonc\u00e9 taking up\nthe mantle in the way she knows\nbest. If Beyonc\u00e9 ever feigned being\n\u2018less awake\u2019, she is plenty woke now.\nMore personal than Beyonc\u00e9, as\nLEMONADE\nIt\u2019s been 0 days since I last cried to Lemonade. Photo Credit: Beyonc\u00e9\nIn\nLemonade\nshe has\ncreated\nmusic to be\nwatched\nfrom Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u2018When the\nLevee Breaks\u2019 to Tchaikovsky\u2019s\n\u2018Scene from Swan Lake\u2019, with\ncollaborations that reads like a\nwho\u2019s who of exciting new musical\ntalent.Jack White lends his voice to\nBeyonc\u00e9\naligns\nherself with\nself-doubt,\nand the\npain and\nhumilation\nit carries\nMorrison writes: \u201cThe master had\nsaid, \u2018You are ugly people.\u2019They had\nlooked about themselves and saw\nnothing to contradict the statement;\nsaw, in fact, support for it leaning at\nthem from every billboard, every\nmovie, every glance. \u2018Yes,\u2019 they had\nsaid. \u2018You are right.\u2019 And they took\nthe ugliness in their hands, threw\nit as a mantle over them, and went\nabout the world with it.\u201d\nYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find any\nminority girl, surrounded by the\npredominantly white mainstream\nmedia, not struggling with these\nThe world\nis waking\nup to the\nreality of\nBeyonc\u00e9\nas a black\nartist\nperson in America is the black\nwoman\u201d, echoes throughout the\nalbum. Beyonc\u00e9 acknowledges that\nsometimes even black communities\nare complicit in the oppression of\nblack women, \u201care you a slave to the\nback of his hand? / Am I talking\nabout your husband, or your father?\u201d\nand she can hardly fail to recognise\nthat many black male artists, Jay\nZ included, rap about racism, and\ndiscrimination even as they rap\nabout women in demeaning terms.\nIn Lemonade, patterns keep\nrepeating. \u201cYou look nothing like\nI\u2019ll say it;\nBeyonc\u00e9\nis a grown\nwoman;\nshe can do\nwhatever\nshe wants\npolitical as \u2018Formation\u2019, Lemonade,\na glorious celebration of healing,\nof self-love, and sisterhood, is in a\nclass of its own. Lemonade proves\nBeyonc\u00e9 to be an artist at the top\nof her game. Others have created\nautobiographical music, they have\neven brought along their famous\nfriends for the ride, but most seems\npedestrian, stuck in the little league;\nalright, I\u2019ll say it; Beyonc\u00e9 is a\ngrown woman; she can do whatever\nshe wants.\nLemonade is out now on TIDAL\n\n"

Twice-elected\nConservative Boris Johnson has\nmoved onto bigger and better\nthings, and now Labour\u2019s Sadiq\nKhan and the Conservative Zac\nGoldsmith are going head to head\nbelow in this: our comparison of the\ntwo frontrunners.\nNot discussed here are the Green\nparty\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry or the Lib Dem\nCaroline Pidgeon, because we\u2019re\nbeing realistic.\nAs usual, it\u2019s very freaking difficult\nto find any information in the run\nup to elections about politicians\u2019\nactual policies with specific figures\nto back them up. We\u2019ve tried to do\nour best. What we have covered\nis both candidates\u2019 fuck-ups,\nupbringings and what they were\ndoing before they became MPs.\nDoes knowing the eastbound route\nof the central line make you a better\nmayoral candidate? That\u2019s for you to\ndecide, friends.\nZac Goldsmith\nFuck-ups\nSo far in this campaign, Zac\u2019s\nbeen accused of\nwading into\nrace relations\nwith all the\ns u b t l e t y\nof, well,\na white\ng u y\nfrom Eton\nwading into\nrace relations.\nIt all started\nwhenhiscampaign\nteam sent leaflets\nout to London\u2019s\nTamil and Indian\nresidents based on their\nsurnames.The Tamil-targeted\nleaflet warned recipients that\nKhan hadn\u2019t used \u201chis position to\nspeak about Sri Lanka of the Tamil\ncommunity in Parliament\u201d.The\ntext was slightly changed\nfor the leaflet targeting\nIndians, which\ntalked about Jeremy\nCorbyn wanting\nto ban Indian PM\nModi from the UK. Voters that the\nGoldsmith camp had identified as\nHindu were told that Zac would\nchampion family-owned businesses,\nand protect them from Labour\u2019s\n\u201cwealth tax on family jewellery\u201d. As\nwell as buying into pretty tired racial\nstereotypes, the surname-based\nimplementation of these leaflets\nleft Sikhs getting leaflets aimed at\nHindus. Many branded the attempt\nat securing the \u2018ethnic\u2019 London vote\npatronising and ill-informed.\nOn more light-hearted territory, a\nsuper awkward video of Goldsmith\nbeing interviewed by the BBC in\nthe back of the cab surfaced a few\nweeks ago,and was a bit of headache\nfor the Conservative candidate.\nHe stumbled over questions\nabout what football teams play at\nwhat stadiums, where the British\nMuseum was, and didn\u2019t know\nwhich stop came after Tottenham\nCourt Road on the central line\n(Holborn by the way). In his\ndefense, he said he only ever takes\ntwo routes on the underground, and\nrelies on Citymapper.\nUpbringing\nHe went to Eton (duh),doesn\u2019t have\na degree and his father was a knight. What did I freakin\u2019 get?! Photo Credit: FELIX\nPolicies\nOne of Goldsmith\u2019s biggest boasts\nis that he\u2019ll wrangle better deals for\nLondon from his compatriots in the\nConservative government.\nHe\u2019s also promising to double\nhouse building in the capital, put\n500 extra police officers on the tube\nand create \u201cmore green spaces\u201d.\nHistory\nDespite being chums with Boris,\nZac has a bit of a reputation for not\nquite toeing the party line. Against\nthe whip, he\u2019s voted for terminally\nill people being allowed to end their\nlives, creating financial incentives\nfor low carbon emission electricity\ngeneration, and various cases for\nconstitutional reform.\nHe was Editor of The Ecologist\nmagazine (a publication founded\nby his uncle) before reviewing\nenvironmental policy for the\nConservatives. In 2010 he followed\ntwo of his grandfathers in becoming\nan MP.\nBefore standing for Mayor,\nGoldsmith sent out a ballot at his\nown expense asking his constituents\nwhether they would be happy with\nhim running for this second role.\nWith a stunning majority, they\nconsented. Like Boris, he is pro-Brexit.\nSadiq Khan\nFuck-ups\nA pretty scary 20-year-old video of\nKhan\u2019s ex-brother-in-law shouting\nabout the evils of the west surfaced\nonline earlier this year. The man in\nquestion, who hasn\u2019t seen Khan in\nyears, is now a high-flying media\nlawyer and dismisses the video as\ndated but foolish.\nAnother accusation of\nconnections to extremists came\nwhen it was discovered Khan\nhad \u201cshared a platform\u201d with an\norganisation backed by extremist\nimam who recruited for al-Qaeda,\nwhilst speaking out against the\nUK\u2019s extradition deal with the US\nin 2005. Both Boris Johnson and\nZac Goldsmith were against this\nextradition arrangement at the time,\nbut did not attend said event. Khan\nhas since distanced himself from the\ngroups, saying the events he spoke\nat had nothing to do with the \u201cvile\u201d\norganisation.\nW h i l e\nGoldsmith\u2019s camp\ncontinued to find\nextremist \u2018links\u2019,\nKhan\u2019s sassy social\nmedia team reacted\nby not shying away\nfrom his faith. An\nexample from his\nTwitter page: \u201cHey @\nZacGoldsmith. There\u2019s\nno need to keep pointing\nat me and shouting \u2018he\u2019s a\nMuslim.\u2019 I put it on my own\nleaflets.\u201d\nUpbringing\nHis dad was a bus\ndriver (he talks\nabout this a\nlot). His\np a r e n t s\nw e r e\nPakistani\nimmigrants,\nand he grew\nup in his\nconstituency.\nPolicies\nAs many a wannabe London\nMayor has proposed, Khan is a fan\nof the \u00a31.50 hour bus ticket, so you\nwouldn\u2019t be penalised for taking a\ncouple of short trips on buses in a\nrow. He\u2019s also promising a four year\nfreeze on tube and bus fares.\nAs far as housing, one of the most\ncontentious points in this election,\nKhan is proposing a \u2018London\nLiving Rent\u2019based on the value of a\nthird of local income. Probably not\nvery promising if you\u2019re living in the\nnice side of Fulham, though.\nHistory\nKhan was a solicitor and chair of\nhuman rights group Liberty, and\nthen became a Labour councillor\nbefore his MP stardom. He used to\nbe the Labour whip and manned\nEd Miliband\u2019s party leadership\ncampaign. He was one of the 35\nMPs who nominated old Jezza\nCorbyn for party leadership last\nyear, but didn\u2019t vote for him in the\nend.\nAccording to theyworkforyou.com\nhe has consistently voted against\nuniversity tuition fees and as for the\nanswer to the question we ask of all\nLabour candidates in a post-Blairite\nworld, he voted against the war in\nIraq.\nLast time Labour were in power\nhe was transport secretary but now\nhe\u2019s a plain old shadow minister and\nMP for Tooting.\nSince we discovered last year that\npolls can\u2019t really be relied on,the race\nhas become a lot more interesting.\nCurrent forecasts do predict a win\nfor Khan and despite Labour\u2019s poor\nperformance in last year\u2019s general\nelection, the party saw a seven seat\ngain in the capital, and now has\nMPs in 45 of London\u2019s 73 seats.\nThe deadline for voter registration\nhas now passed, but it\u2019s pretty easy\nto check if you are registered to vote\nin Thursday\u2019s elections if you haven\u2019t\nreceived a polling card in the post.\nGo to aboutmyvote.co.uk, hammer\nin your term-time postcode, and\nthey\u2019ll give you your local electoral\nregistration office and all of its\ncontact details.Then all you need to\ndo is call or email to check you\u2019re on\ntheir list.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nWhat\u2019s your degree worth now?\nImperial is giving out more firsts and 2:1s than ever\nW\ne\u2019re constantly\nbeing told that\ndegrees aren\u2019t as\nvaluable as they\nused to be. And fair enough. Your\nmate from home\u2019s 2:2 in film and\nmedia studies might not expect\nto be as valuable as your mum\u2019s\ndesmond in computing from the\n80s, but an Imperial degree is an\nImperial degree, right?\nPerhaps not. FELIX took a look\nat the number of grades awarded on\nindividual courses and departments\nbetween 2009 and 2014 and found\nthat there was a significant increase\nin the proportion of 2:1s and firsts\nawarded across most subjects.\nThe biggest leaps have been in\nAeronautics, Mathematics and\nMechanical Engineering, but\nstatistically significant increases\nin the best grades have been seen\nacross most undergraduate courses.\nSo why is this happening?\nThose who graduated in 2009\n(having done a four year course)\nwere the last students to pay the\nnow eye-wateringly low \u00a31175\nannual fees. Students graduating\nfrom 2010 to 2014 were almost\ncertainly paying \u00a33000 a year.\n\u00a39000 fees were introduced from\nSeptember 2012, and these students\nwouldn\u2019t be graduating until 2015\nat the earliest, the data from which\nwas not available.\nWe looked at this difference\nbetween the proportion of 2:1s and\nfirsts earnt in 2009 and compared\nthis to the proportion of these\ngrades awarded in 2014, taking into\naccount the increase in students on\neach course.\nOut of the courses we tested, only\nBioengineering, Computing, Earth\nScience and Engineering, and\nPhysics grades have not increased\nwith any statistical significance.\nNo course has decreased in\nnumber of firsts and 2:1s awarded.\nEvery course has increased in size\nsince 2009.\nThe effective tripling of fees for\nthose who graduated after 2009\nmay mean that subsequent year\ngroups took their degrees a little\nmore seriously, and really felt the\npressure to reach a safe 2:1 or get\nthat holy grail first.\nIt may help to look at the\nmarking policy of the departments\nwhere the degrees awards hasn\u2019t\nchanged. Physics, for example,\nintroduced a scaling algorithm\nback in 2009 to level the playing\nfield. Part of the reason for scaling,\nin the department\u2019s own words,\nis to \u201cprevent the distribution\nof degree classes from changing\nunacceptably\u201d. The algorithm was\ntested on past papers before being\nimplemented,and should not nudge\na student\u2019s final degree classification\nup or down. The system is more a\nway to combat inconsistency in the\ndifficulty of exams between years,\nrather than to bump up individual\nmarks.The algorithm is complicated,\nkind of beautiful if you\u2019re into that\nand is published on the physics\ndepartment\u2019s website. Physics has\nonly seen an increase from 82% to\n84% over five years, which in this\ncase is statistically unexciting.\nThe computing department,\nwho also use a scaling algorithm\non exams, have not given out\nparticularly more firsts and 2:1s\nsince 2009 either.\nThe Mathematics department,\nwho have seen a steady climb from\n62% to 82% over the five years, had\na change in weighting before 2009,\nwith the aim of better reflecting\nstudents\u2019success in the wider choice\nof modules in their final years.\nBefore this, Maths were actually\ngiving out fewer 2:1s than other\ndepartments.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that any courses are\ngetting easier, and everyone we\nspoke to agreed that students are\nworking harder, but some said there\nis variation year on year as to what\nkey topics students have covered in\nschool.\nCould students simply be\ndoing better nowadays? Taking\nMechanical Engineering as an\nexample, the ratio of applications to\nadmissions for those who graduated\nin 2009 was the same as for those\ngraduating in 2014,at 5:1.However,\nthe average A Level tariff score on\nentry jumped from 356 to 557 in\nthat time, probably partially down\nto the introduction of the A* in\n2010. Perhaps it\u2019s simply harder to\nget onto Imperial courses now.\nIt\u2019s also important to remember\nthat there is distinct variation in\nability between year groups. Any\nchange to weighting or scaling takes\na few cohorts before change can be\nseen and methods can be assessed.\nTherefore, there\u2019s a limit to how\nmuch insight we can gain from a five\nyear sample. Regardless of the good\nreasoning behind these changes,\nemployers in 2014 could pick more\nImperial Mech Eng grads with 2:1s\nand firsts than in 2009, and so we\nshould still be interested.\nHow does this compare to the rest\nof the country? Figures gathered\nby the Higher Education Statistics\nagency show that in 2014, there had\nbeen a general trend of increasing\nnumbers of firsts and 2:1s being\nawarded across disciplines. With\nthis, recruiters are looking towards\nstudents who not only have the\ngrades but have experiences beyond\nacademia, for example writing for\ntheir student newspaper. Just saying.\nChun-Yin San,the union\u2019s Deputy\nPresident (Education) told FELIX\nit was: \u201cimportant to emphasise\nis that there\u2019s nothing necessarily\nwrong with more students getting\na first or 2:1 classification, and\ngiven the reputation of Imperial\nI don\u2019t see there being a serious\nrisk of \u2018devaluation\u2019 as a result\nof more people attaining good\nresults. Students are certainly not\nworking any less hard, and courses\naren\u2019t getting less difficult \u2013 if\nanything they are becoming more\nchallenging\u201d.\nWe used a cheeky z score\ncalculation to check whether\nthese differences were statistically\nsignificant, which is standard in\nthe social sciences for comparing\nthe proportions of two different\npopulations. If you really want to\nhave a look at the data we were\nworking from, email the editor,\nalthough it\u2019s all freely available to\nanyone on Imperial\u2019s website.\nThis is a continuing investigation.\nAre you a professor, a dep rep, or\njust an interested party? If you think\nyou know why grades have changed,\nemail the editor at felix@ic.ac.uk.\nThere is\nvariation\nin ability\nbetween\nyear groups\n\n"
