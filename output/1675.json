Tate Britain\nWhen? Until May 7th\n, 2018\nHow Much? \u00a317.70; \u00a315.90\nstudents\nIMPRESSIONISTS IN\nLONDON\nW\nith the news\nfixed on the\nmovement\nof refugees\nin Europe, the Tate has\nturned to an earlier period\nin the continent\u2019s history\nwhen war and political\ninstability caused a surge\nof migration into London.\nBrexit in their crosshairs,\nthe curators preface\nthe new exhibition on\nImpressionists with the\npointed: \u201cthese artists\nfaced no entrance restric-tions; anyone, regardless\nof nationality, could come\nand stay indefinitely\u201d.\nThis seems to be a masterclass in preaching to\nthe choir; few diehard\nproponents of Brexit are\nlikely to be persuaded by\nthe Tate\u2019s history lesson.\nNevertheless, the works\nthe curators have put\ntogether provide a fascinating narrative on the\nFrench artists who came\nto London as refugees\nand how the experience\nshaped their work.\nIt would be a mistake\nto consider this exhibition\nas revision of art history\ncanon: it doesn\u2019t claim,\nand rightfully so, that it\nwas London smog, not\nthe French countryside,\nthat birthed Impressionism, instead it frames\nthe collected works as a\npictorial \u2018Notes from a\nSmall Island\u2019: giants of\nImpressionism shining a\n(mostly) flattering light on\nthe British landscape with\ntheir outsider\u2019s eye.\nPissaro is a particular highlight, his deft\nbrushstrokes elevate a\nsnow covered street in\nSydenham to a glittering\nidyll. In another, a steam\nHampton is transfixing;\na explosion of pointillist\ngreen. These parochial,\npeaceful scenes are placed\nin sharp contrast to Siebe\nJohannes Ten Cate\u2019s\npaintings of Paris burning.\nIn La Place du Carrousel\n: The Ruins of Tuileries,\nstrong lines of duck egg\nblue and deep burnt sienna\ncollide on the canvas\nevoking the acrid smell of\nsmoke and a biting winter\nchill.\nElsewhere James\nJacques Joseph Tissot, not\nstrictly an Impressionist,\nbut one of the French\nartists who settled in\nLondon following the\nFranco-Prussian war,\nturns his keen caricaturist\u2019s\u2019 eye to English high\nsociety. His canvases, far\nfrom mocking (as he was\nsometimes accused of\nbeing) cast a humanising,\ngently teasing eye over\nthe Victorians and their\nfamous stiff upper lips.\nHis work is richly, often\namusingly detailed: in\nToo Early figures leans\nagainst the doorway awkwardly having gotten to a\nparty before it\u2019s started,\ntheir faces frozen in a\ngrimace of social anxiety,\nin another painting, this\none of a violin concert, a\nyoung woman, carefully\nexpressionless, eyes\nglazing over, sinks into\na chaise longue, body\ndisappearing into a swathe\nof bows.\nDespite the prominence\nplaced on the artist in\nthe Tate\u2019s advertising for\nthe exhibition, Monet\ntakes up relatively little\nspace in the gallery. In\nLeicester Square at Night\na storm of slashes of deep\nultramarine and indigo\nare intercut with vibrant\nlemon yellows and tangerines and ceruleans, it was\npainted in 1901 but could\njust as well be last night.\nThe beauty of Monet\u2019s\ncanvases of London seem\ntantalizingly close. Step\nout of the Tate at sunset\nhave slight modulations\nof perspective and colour:\nwhorls of dusky plum melt\ninto violet, mustard, peach\nand scarlet, in each the sun\nburns fiercely, each glows\nwith an inner light. For\nall the fervour of Monet\u2019s\nvision of the Thames, the\nmost powerful depictions\nof the river belong to\nWhistler.\nIn the series Nocturne:\nBlue and Silver, Whistler\npaints the Cremorne\nLights, Old Battersea\nBridge, and Chelsea in\nwashes of ultramarine.\nLayers of the palest,\nloveliest blues and greys\nmeld into each other,\nwavering droplets of gold\nrepresent the lights on the\ndistant shore. Oscar Wilde\nsummed up the visceral\npower of Whistler\u2019s\nwork with characteristic\nflair: \u201cto whom if not to\nWhistler do we owe these\nsilver mists that brood\nover our river. There\nmay have been fogs for\ncenturies... but no one saw\nthem... they did not exist\ntill art invented them\u201d.\nStanding in front of these\nquiet deeply intense paintings I felt the same sense\nof magic I sometimes feel\nwalking home alone late\nat night, the same magic\nVirginia Woolf conjures\nup in the opening pages\nof Mrs Dalloway as she\ndescribes the capital\nwaking up: London for all\nits famous bustle is often\nits most seductive when\nthe crowds have left.\nIt\u2019s a pity then that\nWhistler doesn\u2019t feature\nmore heavily, a greater\nshame that the contribution of British artists to\nImpressionism, particularly that of J.M.W Turner is\nleft unexplored. At times\nthe curation feels a bit\ntoo focused on the artists\u2019\nstatuses as French emigres\nthan the nature of their\nwork; as a love letter to\nthe London of the time\nhowever, it is marvellous.\n\u201cThe works\nprovide a\nfascinating\nnarrative on\nthe French\nartists who\ncame to\nLondon as\nrefugees\u201d\nengine powers through\nrolling hills, his painting\nof cricket match in sunny\n\u201cStep out of\nthe Tate at\nsunset, and it\ncould almost\nbe into Monet\u2019s\npaintings of\nWestminster\u201d\nand it could almost be into\nMonet\u2019s paintings of the\npalaces of Westminster\nseen through smog rolling\nover the Thames.

KWEENS EVERYWHERE! // Indira Mallik\nHome Is the Place\u2026\nYas! \u2013 Kweens take the stage as part of TEDxUCL Women 2017.\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nARTS\nI\nf weeks had themes,\nthe theme of last\nweek would\u2019ve been\nempowerment. On\nWednesday I ventured\ndown into Imperial\u2019s\nEnterprise Labs as part\nof the WE Innovate\nscheme and met dozens\nof inspiring, amazingly\nambitious women just\nat the beginning of their\ncareers desperate to make\na difference in the world.\nOn Sunday, slightly\nfurther afield, in the\nPeople\u2019s Palace \u2013 a part of\nQueen Mary\u2019s \u2013 I met an\nequally amazing group of\nwomen assembled for the\nTedxUCL Women lineup.\nThe theme for this year,\nthe fourth iteration of the\nTEDxUCL Women format\nwas \u2018home\u2019 - a subject\nthat each of the speakers\nexplored with a different\nlens. For Dr Olesya\nMyakonkaya, \u2018home\u2019\nmeant looking beyond the\nreaches of our planet and\nconsidering how the future\nof human colonisation on\nMars (an event she considers inevitable) could\ngo beyond technology for\ntechnology\u2019s sake. Similar\nthemes of humanist development were explored\nlater by Shelley Sacks.\nSacks, a \u2018social sculptor\u2019,\nspoke movingly of her\nchildhood in apartheid\nSouth Africa, and the rift\nthe racial division created\nin her early life, even situations as banal as dinner\ntime. Using the example\nof their family kitchen\nin which these tensions\nwould boil over, Sacks\nspoke on the theme of\nimagining a future where\ningrained biases are challenged and overcome.\nHalima Hussain\nexplained how the transformative experience\nof participating in a\nmixed-gender prayer\nbehind a female imam\nbroke down her preconceptions what a Muslim\nprayer could look like.\nFollowing this, Hussain, a\ntheologian with an interest\nin feminist readings of the\nQuran, founded the Inclusive Mosque Initiative\n(IMI) with Dervla Shannahan and Tamsila Tauqir.\nHussain described IMI as a\nplace where inclusion, regardless of gender, sexual\norientation, or disability is\nat the forefront of religious\npractice. In one of the most\npowerful moments of the\nday, Hussain decried the\nmedia\u2019s propensity to pit\nIMI against the more traditional interpretations of\nin Subhadra Das\u2019 witty,\npassionate talk. Das, a\nhistorian and curator of\nthe Francis Galton collection at the UCL Pathology\nand Science Collections,\nspoke about exposing the\nracist history of UCL \u2013 an\ninstitution essential to the\nestablishment of eugenics\nas an accepted science in\nBritain in the 19th\ncentury,\nand a place Das considers\nhome after spending the\nvast majority of her adult\nlife there, first as a student,\nthen as an educator.\nQuoting Robert Frost she\nsaid \u201cI used to consider\nhome as a place they had\nto take you in... [but now]\nI like to say home is the\nplace, when I got there, I\ntried to make better\u201d.\nTED talks as a format\nare so popular and so\nengaging because it is a\nchance to gain a primer\ninto a complex subject\nwithin a few minutes, the\nbrevity proved a curse\nas well as a blessing\non Sunday however. I\ncould\u2019ve easily listened to\nanother hour of the playwright Jules Orco who\nspoke with verve about\nnegotiating the London\narts scene as a Filipino\nwoman and the importance of recognising that\nmere representation \u2013 as\ndifficult as it is to achieve\n\u2013 is useless without real\nand actual power: there\u2019s\nno point having a seat at\nthe table if you cannot\nthe shape the discussion.\nWhere Orco shone,\nthe format completely\nobscured the brilliance of\nother speakers \u2013 Ashleigh\nBoyd who was presenting\nher own stem cell research\npost-it notes where delegates were encouraged to\nwrite their own definition,\nthe descriptions varied\nfrom the single word\n\u201cdoggies :)\u201d to \u201cthe place\nin which your existence\nneed not be justified\u201d.\nOn a day where the talks\nwere truly intersectional,\ncentered just as much on\nrace, religion, and economics as on feminism, where\nthe speakers spoke pas-sionately, movingly about\nhow their experiences has\nshaped their worldview, I\nkept thinking of a line from\nLittle Gidding: \u201cthe end of\nall our exploring / Will be\nto arrive where we started\n/ And know the place for\nthe first time\u201d. Home, so\ninextricably linked to our\nchildhood seemed to be\na thing always changing:\nalbeit with a constant,\n\u201chome,\u201d said Grace\nVictory during her spoken\nword performance, gesturing towards herself \u201cis\nthis \u2013 home is me\u201d.\nIn giving women from\nall different fields and\nviewpoints a platform,\nthe TEDxUCL Women\nteam are doing something\nworthwhile, something\nessential: long may they\ncontinue.\n\u201cHome was\na subject\nthat each of\nthe speakers\nexplored with\na different\nlens\u201d\nIslam and extended a hand\nof solidarity to her Muslim\nsisters who choose not\nembrace IMI\u2019s ideals\u201cwomen who do not want\nto pray behind women\nimams are not in need of\nreform... plenty of strong\nwomen and feminism\nexists in the spaces of our\nparents\u201d.\nHussain\u2019s quiet revolution borne out of love for\na community was echoed\n\u201cThe speakers\nspoke about\nhow their life\nexperiences\nhad shaped\ntheir world\nview\u201d\nfor treatment of diabetes\nhad barely gotten past\nexplaining what diabetes\nwas and its devastating\nimpact before her time\nwas up.\nHome.

Lord\nWinston was speaking\nwith Professor Gary\nButler, consultant in\npaediatric and adolescent\nmedicine and endocrinology at University College\nHospital.\nLord Winston, who\nis best known for his\nsecurity professionals are\nlocated on both sides of\nthe Metric door on busy\nevenings, monitoring and\ncontrolling capacity and\ncustomer flow.\u201d\nThe Union added:\n\u201cThe doors from Metric\n[leading] directly to the\nquad are readily available\nfor temporary use to ease\ncapacity issues whenever\nrequired.\u201d According to\nour source \u201cbar staff are\ninstructed not to open\nNo risk of any harm at Metric, says Union\nthe fire doors on the side\nunless it is an emergency\u201d.\nThe Union said that the bar\nsupervisor may \u201coccasionally\u201d temporarily open the\nside doors to ease crowd\nflow but the doors are\nnormally kept closed to\nreduce noise levels in the\nquad (as per an agreement\nwith Beit Hall). It added\nthat in an emergency, \u201cbar\nand security staff would\nlead a swift evacuation\nthat would use all doors to\nsafely relocate our guests.\u201d\nThe Union also said:\n\u201cThe safety of our\nmembers is paramount to\nImperial College Union\nand we would simply\nnever operate a venue or\nevent that posed a risk\nto our guests. All of the\nrelevant authorities are\nconfident that Metric is a\nsafe venue with effective\ncrowd management.\u201d\nDiscussions, which\nbegan before inquiries\nby Felix, are underway\nbetween the Union,\nEstates Facilities, and\nother College teams to\nfind ways to \u201cpermanently\nupgrade our abilities to\nmanage Metric\u2019s access\nand egress capacity\u201d. Suggestions include reviewing where security staff\nare located throughout the\nevening and expanding the\nMetric doors. According\nto the Union, \u201cthe Fire\nOffice is clear that Metric\nhas enough doors to significantly exceed the legal\nrequirements for safety.\u201d\nNames have been\nchanged.\nNEWS\n(cont.)\npioneering in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques\nand his media career,\nsaid he was concerned\nabout epigenetic factors\ninvolved in the perception\nof gender, as well as long-term effects on fertility.\nHe said: \u201cif you look at\nthe results of gender reassignment [surgery], the\nresults are horrendous in\na big proportion of cases.\u201d\nHe also said \u201cabout 40%\u201d\nof people who undergo\nvaginal reconstruction will\nrequire further surgery.\nHe said he had spoken\nto people who had undergone such surgeries, and\nwere now \u201cquite unhappy\npeople who now feel\nbadly damaged\u201d. Professor Butler advised that\nthe medical sector should\nproceed with caution,\nsaying \u201cthere are a lot of\nfactors we haven\u2019t untangled\u201d\nFollowing the pro-gramme, there was strong\ncriticism of Lord Winston\nfrom a number of Twitter\nusers, who disputed the\nsources he had cited. One\nsaidthathisuseoftheword\n\u2018horrendous\u2019 \u201cis wrong\nand discredits you as a\nfellow academic\u201d, while\nRachel Evans, a software\nengineer for the BBC, said\nshe was \u201cdisappointed that\nmy employer has, once\nagain, apparently just\nbroadcast an inaccurate,\nmisleading attack on trans\nkids\u201d. Zoe O\u2019Connell, a\nLiberal Democrat Cambridge city councillor, said\nit was \u201ceither cluelessness\nor dishonest use of statistics to prop up a political\nviewpoint.\u201d\nFelix spoke to one\nstudent, who said they felt\nit was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for\nLord Winston to speak\non a topic in which he\u2019s\nnot an expert, and it was\n\u201cirresponsible\u201d of him to\n\u201cto emphasise the negatives of transition without\nacknowledging the positives.\u201d They expressed\nthat \u201cwhile Lord Winston\nwas arguing that we don\u2019t\nfully understand the aeti-ology of gender dysphoria\nso we should be cautious\nin treating it, there are\nplenty of things we don\u2019t\nunderstand in medicine,\nand that doesn\u2019t mean we\ndon\u2019t treat those issues.\u201d\nLord Winston later\nstated on Twitter \u201cI have\nnothing against transgender [sic]. But I object when\nI have cited independent\npeer reviewed papers\nwith full evidence for\nwhat I said\u201d. The Mail on\nSunday then published an\narticle by Lord Winston,\nin which he said he found\nit \u201cdisturbing to be called\nbigoted and homophobic\u201d,\nand said that \u2013 while many\npeople are \u201chappy and\ngrateful\u201d for gender reassignment surgery \u2013 \u201cuntil\nwe understand the underlying reason for gender\ndysphoria...we must be\nextremely cautious.\u201d\nIn a statement, a College\nrepresentative told Felix\n\u201cThe College upholds\nacademic freedom within\nthe law. We fully support\nthe rights of our staff and\nstudents to participate in\nfree and open discussion\n\u2013 particularly on complex\nissues where their knowledge and expertise can\nhelp inform debate.\u201d\nData from the Tavistock\nCentre\u2019s Gender Identity\nDevelopment Service\n(GIDS), which was\nestablished for children\nand young people experienced difficulties with\ngender identity, showed\na marked rise in referrals\nover the last five years.\nFrom 2009/10 to 2015/16,\nthe number of under-11s\nbeing referred to GIDS\nhad increased from 23 to\n217.

The last few\nweeks with the servers\nbeing down has really\nshown me that, in the\nwords of Joni Mitchell,\n\u201cyou don\u2019t know what\nyou\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone\u201d.\nWhile putting together\nthese issues on a single\ncomputer has been stress-ful, what I really found\ndifficult was being out of\nthe office, and not chatting\nwith any of the great team\nwho make up Felix (shout\nout to you guys!). They\u2019ve\nbeen super patient while\nwe\u2019ve been having these\nissues, ensuring they get\nall their work in super\nearly, and sending supportive emojis. They\u2019re\nalso the only ones who\nread this editorial, apart\nfrom my mum, so props to\nthem for that.\nThis week Felix has\nbeentakingalookatwhat\u2019s\nbeen going on around\ncampus \u2013 for once, it\u2019s an\nissue without any mention\nof a survey! Blimey! Our\nmain story of the week is\nabout crowding at Metric.\nIt\u2019s not something I would\nknow a huge amount\nabout to be honest, since\nI spend most of my day\nin the West Basement,\nand only nip out to make\na beeline to the Central\nLibrary for my muffin fix.\nBut I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a\npretty popular place, and\nthe whole Union Building\nis gonna be even busier\nonce Blackett introduces\npre-poured pints, so it\u2019s\nsomething that needs\nto be sorted out. While\nthe Union says that the\nsituation isn\u2019t unsafe, it\u2019s\ndefinitely not pleasant for\nthose trying to get through\nthat tiny door to the dance-floor.\nWe\u2019vealsobeenlooking\nat the Bottle Match \u2013 the\nannual rugby (and other\nteams, yeah, but mainly\nrugby) match between\nRoyal School of Mines\nand Camborne School of\nMines, which reportedly\nwas being threatened with\ncancellation. Naturally\nthis upset CSM and RSM\nquite a lot, to the extent\nthat CSM students made\na petition against it being\nshut down, but in the end\nit was all put down to a\n\u2018communication error\u2019,\nand the match will be\ngoing ahead. I got quite\ninto this drama, and was\nplanning on going to the\nmatch this year to report\non it, but then I found out\nit was in Cornwall. I don\u2019t\ngo outside the M25, so\nthat\u2019s a no-no for me, but\nmaybe next year!\nFinally, we\u2019ve reported\non some of the comments\nmade by Lord Robert\nWinston about gender\nreassignment surgery,\nwhich he said can leave\nmany people \u201cquite badly\ndamaged\u201d. For many\npeople, this was a classic\ncase of \u2018stay in your lane\u2019:\nLord Winston is a fertility\nexpert, and not an expert\non gender dysphoria, so\nmany questioned whether\nhe should be commenting\non the topic. It\u2019s one thing\nto encourage healthy\ndebate on important issues,\nbut when trans youth are\nat a much higher risk of\nsuicide than the rest of the\npopulation, hearing such\nviews being endorsed on\nthe radio can be incredibly\ndamaging.\nOf course, what I\u2019ve\ngone through here is just\nthe tip of the Felix iceberg.\nThere\u2019s a full 40 pages of\ngreat quality #content for\nyou to go through, put\ntogether lovingly by the\nFelix team, who were\nwarmly welcomed back\ninto the office this week\n(although our Sports\nEditor has some strange\nopinions on figs). So go!\nExplore! Enjoy! Just don\u2019t\n@ me.\n2\nComment article got you irate? Want to score some free tickets\nto the theatre? Excited by some new scientific developments?\nWe want to hear from you!\nWe're always looking for writers to contribute to the paper. If\nyou're interested, drop us a line on felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

I am sure\nmany students, including\nmyself, wonder whether it\nis possible to eat a healthy,\nbalanced diet while also\nliving on a shoestring.\nFor me, the supermarket\nis none other than the place\nfor distraction and procrastination after spending\nhours and hours camping\nout in the library. As part\nof this retail therapy, I\nenjoy pulling my cart\nthrough the winding aisles\nof my local Sainsbury\u2019s,\nimmersing myself with\nthoughts of the scandal-ously-indulgent array of\ncakes, the luscious semi-sweet Lindt chocolate, or\nmy favourite: Jaffa Cakes.\nOr maybe I\u2019ll conveniently reach for the ready-to-bake fish cakes, crispy\nthick-cut chips, or packs\nof microwaveable ready-made meals. I\u2019m not trying\nto deny that there are days\n(or most of the days)\nwhen we, as students, are\nrunning against time and\nthe best solution to satisfy\nour hunger is any food that\ncan be sorted out quickly:\nfood without much preparation and cooking, which\nalso means less washing\nup.\nBut at the other end of\nthe spectrum, following a\ndieting trend mindlessly\nand overly-focusing\non the numbers on the\nweighing scale doesn\u2019t\nonly affect the metabolism\nrates of our bodies, and\nour general well-being,\nbut can inadvertently lead\nto destroying a healthy\nrelationship with food.\nWhen I think about\nkeeping up a sustainable\nway of eating, I think\n\u2018could I follow this plan in\nthe long run?\u2019 I know with\nmost diets I will possibly\ngive up well before I\nachieve my \u2018diet goal\u2019.\nHence, I learned to eat\nin moderation \u2013 eating\nwhat is right for my body\nand adhering to a mindful\nway of eating.

If you\ncompare Felix to Pi Media\nat UCL or The Beaver\nat LSE they\u2019re of pretty\nsimilar quality.\nA: Because we at Imperial haven\u2019t been\ntaught a formula for\nhow to write an article\ndo you think that\u2019s an\nadvantage we have,\nto avoid everything\nbecoming stale?\nF: Speaking from experience in medicine \u2013 and\nI think it\u2019s pretty similar\nfor other disciplines as\nwell \u2013 you spend a lot of\nyour time reading and\nanalysing data and the\nscientific literature. I\nthink that tempers your\nmind to going through a\nlot of material and then\ndistilling it down to your\nlab report or coursework.\nSo, I think that\u2019s one thing\nthat scientists have that\nisn\u2019t as prominent in other\nsubjects.\nI think as well, for me\nit\u2019s really important as\nan editor that, although\nyou obviously want your\nwriters to be good and\nup to scratch, you also\nwant them to have their\nown personal style and\nyou don\u2019t want to impose\nyour style on them. So,\nthroughout my editorial\ncareer I\u2019ve always been\nvery careful to look at\na piece and think \u201cAm\nI changing it because it\nneeds to be changed? Or\nam I changing it because\nthis is how I would\nwrite it?\u201d It\u2019s a fine line\nbetween those two. Since\nthe students we have here\nhaven\u2019t been taught \u201cHere\nis the style that you should\nbe writing in\u201d it frees them\nup a little more to write in\ntheir own way.\nA: Normally at this\npoint, I\u2019d ask if you\u2019re\ninterest in the arts is a\nhobby, or if they want\nto pursue it as a job,\nbut Editor in Chief of\nFelix is, in fact, your\njob. Was there an experience or an event\nthat motivated you to\nrun for the position?\nF: To be honest, I\u2019d been\nthinking about it for three\nor four years \u2013 when you\ndo a medical degree, you\nhave a massive amount\nof time to dwell on stuff\n\u2013 and I\u2019d always planned\nto run in this year. I think\nthe most formative experience was in my third year\nwhen I was running the\nArts section with Kamil\nMcClelland, another\nmedic in my year, and\nduring that year we both\ngot really involved. Our\nstudies probably suffered\na bit, but we were putting\nout six to eight pages\nof Arts a week, and we\nedited three editions of the\nPhoenix arts magazine on\ntop of that. It was a really\nrewarding experience and\nprobably the trigger point\nto get more involved in\nFelix. And here we are\ntoday.\nA: And how are you\nenjoying the job so\nfar?\nF: We\u2019ve had some IT\nissues over the past few\nweeks. We\u2019ve had no\ncomputers [in the Felix\noffice] so I\u2019ve been putting\neverything together which\nis not as fun. The first few\nweeks before that were\nreally good and I think we\nwere really bonding as an\neditorial team and learning\ntheir skills. For the past\nfew weeks we haven\u2019t\nbeen able to do that so\nit\u2019s been quite frustrating.\nApart from that it\u2019s been\nvery good. Oh, and people\ncomplaining have not been\ngood either, but I think I\u2019m\nstarting to develop a thick\nskin.\nA: Do you have any\nplans for the paper\nthis year that you\u2019re\nexcited to enact?\nObviously, the style\nof the paper has\nchanged this year.\nF: Last year it was a very\nfree layout and I think it\nwas quite ambitious. This\nyear we\u2019ve got a lot of\nnew people in who haven\u2019t\nused InDesign before and\nI think last year\u2019s layout\nwould have been really\ntough on them. So, we\nsimplified it and stripped\nit back down.\nIn terms of future\ndevelopments, one\nthing I\u2019m really trying\nto push this year is the\nLongread. We\u2019ve had two\nso far; they\u2019re three to\nfour-thousand words on\na single topic and people\ncan go really in-depth.\nWe\u2019re going to be trying\nto publish more of those\nthroughout the year. More\ngenerally, holding the\nCollege and the Union to\naccount more, and doing\nF: What appeals to me\nmore is writing the interesting pieces: it\u2019s the\nsexy bit of journalism\nthat everyone\u2019s interested\nin. The New Yorker, for\nexample, does a lot of\ninvestigative journalism\nwhere they get all this\ndata and all these different\nviewpoints and draw\nit together into a really\nwell-written narrative. It\ngoes back to the New Journalism School in the \u201860s\nwhere you have people\nlike Joan Didion, and\nTruman Capote writing\nIn Cold Blood. That kind\nof journalism I find really\nexciting and something\nI\u2019d like to pursue more\nof. I\u2019m not saying Felix\nis going to be as good as\nJoan Didion\u2019s work, but\nwe have high aspirations.\nA: Looking to the fu-ture, there\u2019s a chance\nthat in the next ten\nyears Felix will change\na lot, especially in\nterms of how it\u2019s published with a battle\nbetween print and\nonline. How do you\nsee the paper chang-ing?\nF: I\u2019m a strong proponent\nof print and print media,\nbut I think it\u2019s a really\ndifficult time for print and\njournalism in general. In\nterms of Felix I\u2019d love it\nto carry on in print, but\nI think there\u2019s general\npressure to move uni publications to online-only\nplatforms. This year the\nUnion is carrying out a\nFelix Review where they\nlook at the funding model\nand the aims of the paper;\nit\u2019s not being done with\nthe goal of moving away\nfrom print, but one of the\nfindings might be that the\npaper is not cost effective\nand having it in print\ndoesn\u2019t bring a particular\nvalue. I\u2019d disagree and\nsay it has a lot of value,\nbut you can\u2019t measure the\nmonetary value of print\nand the benefits it brings,\nyou can only measure the\nnegative, which is how\nmuch it costs.\nThat being said, print\nmedia is a bit like vinyl\nrecords, in that it\u2019s experiencing a bit of a surge\nright now, especially with\nmicro-publishing. And I\nthink people are getting\ntired of online journalism.\nIf you look at a website\nlike The Independent and\nthe amount of advertising\nthey need to sustain that\nmodel, I think that\u2019s\nturning a lot people off\nand turning them back to\nprint media.\nWe\u2019ll see what happens,\nbut whatever comes of the\nFelix review I\u2019m going\nto be pushing to keep the\npaper in print.\nA: Whether it\u2019s physical or digital, how do\nyou see Felix\u2019s role in\nthe future changing?\nF: The motto of Felix is\n\u2018Keep the cat free\u2019 and\nI think that\u2019s going to\ncontinue.Ithinkhaveafree\npress is the cornerstone of\nany democracy, especially\na student democracy. The\ncore aims of Felix are to\nrepresent the student voice\nand to ensure their views\nare heard by the College\nand Union and ensure no\nchanges are made about\nyou, without you. That\u2019s\nsomething I strongly\nbelieve in and I think\ngoing forward if Felix\nloses that, there\u2019s no point\nin having it anymore.\n\u201cWhatever\ncomes of the\nFelix Review\nI\u2019m going to\nbe pushing to\nkeep the paper\nin print\u201d\n\u201cOne thing\nwe\u2019re really\ntrying to push\nthis year is\nthe longread,\nwhich lets you\nget really in-depth on a\nsingle topic\u201d\nsome more investigative\njournalism. I feel for the\nlast couple of years there\nhasn\u2019t been a huge amount\nof that done at Felix.\nA: When writing an\nInvestigative journalism piece are you\nmore interested in\ngetting a scoop, or\nwriting an interesting\npiece?\nFelix team about to drop the hottest mixtape of 2k17 // Seb Gonzato\nArts Editor Adam Gellatly talks with Felix\u2019s very own Editor in Chief Fred Fyles to chat about arts at Imperial and\nhis current and previous roles at the paper.\nARTS\nAdam Gellatly\nArts Editor\n\u201cI think in all\nsubjects there\u2019s\na minority\nthat are into\nthe arts, but\nthose that are\ngo deep. No\nmatter what\nsubject you\u2019re\nin you can find\nyour niche\u201d\nAdam: Readers will\nknow you as the current Editor of Felix,\nbut you were involved\nin the Arts Section at\nthe paper before that.\nCan describe how that\ninvolvement came\nabout?\nFred: I\u2019ve always been interested in arts and culture.\nI grew up in London and\nwhen I was younger I went\nto the theatre a lot and my\nparents would take me to\nart galleries. Coming to\nImperial, I knew I wanted\nto write for the paper and\nget involved with the Arts\nsection. I mainly started\ndoing reviews of visual\nculture \u2013 I think my first\narticle was about the\nTurner Prize \u2013 and theatre.\nTowards the end of first\nyear I started really getting\nintofilmandinsecondyear\nI took a Horizons course\nthat introduced me to the\nphilosophy and theory of\nart. Then in third year I\nstarted editing on Felix\nand that got me interested\nin graphic design. It\u2019s been\nbits and bobs throughout\nthe years leading to an\naccumulation of interests.\nA: Were you interested in\nthe arts at school?\nF: At A-Level I did\nBiology, Chemistry,\nMaths, and Further Maths,\nso not very arty at all. I\ndid History AS, but that\nwas as humanities as it\ngot. Coming to university\nchanged that a lot. I grew\nup in North London, but I\nwent to school near Hertfordshire where there\u2019s not\na huge amount of cultural\nstuff to do. In first year,\nliving in South Kensington\nwhere the South Bank and\nthe Tate are just a bus-ride\naway, it really opens up\nhow much you can go\nand do and see. That\u2019s\nalso when I started getting\ninto the student discounts.\nWhen I was in first and\nsecond year, Barbican\nused to run the FreeB\nscheme \u2013 every single\nmonth they\u2019d release loads\nof tickets \u2013 and I\u2019d go to\nfive or six things a month\nfrom that.\nA: Do you think\nMedical students\nhave more of an\nopen-mindedness\nwhen it comes to interests in the arts,\ncompared to those\nstudying a natural science or engineering?\nF: My impression of\nImperial is that all subjects\nare pretty similar in terms\nof how artistic people\nare; I think in all subjects\nthere\u2019s a minority that are\ninto the arts, but those that\nare go deep. No matter\nwhat subject you\u2019re in you\ncan find your niche and\npeople who are interested\nin arts as well.\nI guess with medicine,\nthere\u2019s more of an opportunity to bring what\nyou do in arts into your\nvocational practice. Last\nyear I did six weeks in a\npsychiatry placement and\none of the consultants\nthere said, \u201cEverything\nyou do and everything\nyou see can feed into your\npsychiatry practice\u201d. You\nhave to understand where\nthe patient is coming from,\nwhere they\u2019re located in\ntheir cultural context.\nA: As we\u2019ve discussed\nbefore in this seg-ment, there\u2019s the perception from outside\nImperial \u2013 and from\nperhaps the inside \u2013\nthat we\u2019re all about\nSTEM here as that\u2019s\nall we study. Do you\nthink the quality of\nthe arts output at Imperial suffers from the\nlack of, say, English\nstudents?\nF: Focusing on Felix\nspecifically, you might\nlook at the fact we have\nno English, Journalism, or\nHistory students and think\nthat means very few people\nare going to get involved,\nor that there\u2019ll be very few\nwriters of quality. That\u2019s\ndefinitely not the case.\nThe writers and editors\nwe have are top quality\nand really committed. I\nactually think it\u2019s a benefit\nthat we don\u2019t have English\nor Journalism students\nhere; it means the people\nwho get involved in arts\nat Imperial are not getting\ninto it with the mind of\ndoing it as a career and\nbuilding up a portfolio,\nbut because they really\nenjoy it.\nBut if we did have those\nEnglish students, I think\nthe team would be bigger.\nIt would relieve some of\nthe pressure on the section\neditors \u2013 they\u2019d definitely\nhave more contributors.\nSo, in some ways you\ncould say the quality does\nsuffer a little. If we had a\nwhole raft of Journalism\nstudents I think we\u2019d\nprobably have a bigger\npaper with more content,\nFred taking notes on how to be a proper journalist, like Mark Ruffalo in Spotlight // Joseph O\u2019Connell-Danes\nClash of Cultures: Can the arts thrive in the science\ndominated campus of Imperial?\n\n"

Most films\nthat deal with war often\ntend to hover around a\nparticular incident during\nthe conflict. Whether\nthat be the evacuation\nof Dunkirk (Dunkirk),\nthe Battle of Okinawa\n(Hacksaw Ridge), or the\nstruggle to bring a fellow\nsoldier back home (Saving\nPrivate Ryan). These films\ntell the story of war as a\nhero\u2019s journey to overcome enormous obstacles\nand complete their mission\nin service to their country\nand fellow soldiers.\nOther war dramas\nhowever, shoot with a\nmuch wider lens and tell\ntheir stories as a series\nof episodes in the main\ncharacter\u2019s life. American\nSniper and The Hurt\nLocker are two examples\nof such films; First\nThey Killed My Father\nis another. The film has\nno definitive three-act\nstructure, but instead\nrolls along from scene\nto scene, portraying the\nimmense fortitude that\nallowed Loung Ung and\nher siblings to survive\nthrough the some of the\nmost trying experiences of\ntheir lives.\nWe are introduced to\nLoung Ung (Sreymoch\nSareum) as a seven-year-old girl living in a modest\nPhnom Penh apartment\nwith her parents and six\nsiblings. At the time, her\ngreatest bother seems to be\nwhether she can dance as\nwell as her older brother,\nKhouy (Khoun Sothea).\nThat all changes when a\ncompany of Khmer Rouge\nrevolutionaries march\ninto the city and begin a\nforcible evacuation. The\nKhmer Rouge claim that\nthe United StatesAir Force\nwill be bombing the city in\nthree days, and therefore,\nthose who wish to survive\nmust leave immediately.\nWe see parents carrying\nbabies in bedsheets, men\nthrowing luggage onto\ncarts, and others leaving\nwith nothing more than the\nclothes on their backs. As\nLoung\u2019s parents desperately stuff their suitcases, her\nolder brother, Meng (Heng\nDara), yells to her \u201cGo and\neat something\u201d, knowing\nthat they will likely not\nhave food for several\ndays. Loung\u2019s parents,\nwho only moments earlier\nseemed as happy as a\nhoneymooning couple,\nare now gripped with\nfear as they are marched\nalong an open highway,\nout of the nation\u2019s capital\nand into the countryside.\nChild soldiers line the\nstreets with AK-47s in\ntow as they yell orders at\nthe fleeing citizens. Jolie\ndepicts these scenes from\nthe perspective of the\nyoung and na\u00efve Loung,\nthus injecting them with\na mixture of confusion\nand tense uncertainty at\nwhat the future bodes for\nthis family. Not a single\ngunshot is fired throughout this entire ordeal, but\nthe frenzied, turbulent and\ngenerally chaotic atmosphere perfectly captured\nthrough the eyes of 7-year-old Loung, leave you in no\ndoubt as to the brutality of\nthe Khmer Rouge regime\n\u2013 the regime infamous for\nperpetrating the Cambodian genocide that wiped out\nroughly a quarter of the\ncountry\u2019s population.\nThe film then proceeds\nin an episodic fashion,\nwith each chapter bringing\nmore challenges than the\nlast. First, the family must\nsurvive starvation as they\nmarch endlessly along\nopen roads. Then, after\nbeing taken in by relatives,\nthey are once again forced\nto flee when said relatives\nbecome anxious about\noffering shelter to Loung\u2019s\nfather (played by a humble\nand taciturn Phoeung\nKompheak) because he is a\nhigh-ranking government\nofficial and therefore, a\nprime target for the hatred\nof the Khmer Rouge. After\nthat, they are captured by a\ncompany of Khmer Rouge\nsoldiers and sent off to a\nlabour camp, where they\nmust fight disease, hunger,\nheat and misery to stay\nalive. Perhaps the only\nthing truly keeping them\nalive is the bond they share\nwith another. But even that\nbegins to break when three\nof Loung\u2019s siblings are led\naway by Khmer Rouge\nofficers, presumably to\na \u201cre-education camp\u201d\nwhere they will be trained\nto become child soldiers.\nThe entire film is\ntold through the eyes of\n7-year-old Loung, but\ndespite that, her lines are\nfew enough to fit onto\ntwo sides of A4. This is\nbecause Jolie and Loung\nUng herself, have chosen\nto dispense with dialogue\nand instead tell the latter\u2019s\nstory as a sequence of raw\nand unfiltered emotional\nreactions to the atrocities\nthat took place around\nher. As a result, the film\nis an entirely experiential\nnarrative of how Loung,\nand several other children\nlike her, managed to\nsurvive through one of the\nworst genocides in human\nhistory. In the film, Loung\ncannot comprehend the\nlarger meaning of all the\nwarfare unfolding around\nher, and so responds to\nit with a kaleidoscopic\nmixture of fear and confusion \u2013 the reflection\nof a desperate attempt to\ncomprehend a world that\nhas turned upside down.\nThis is important, because\nas adults viewing the\neffects of warfare through\nthe eyes of a young child,\nyou begin to see just how\nsuch violence feeds off\nthe destruction of entire\nfamilies and in particular,\nhow it destroys the lives\nof the children who die as\nwell as those who survive.\nChildren who were once\ninnocent and joyful souls,\nare indoctrinated with a\nfanatical ideology and\ninspired to perpetuate\nthe cycle of violence that\neffected the destruction\nof their own families.\nThis is most evident\nwhen towards the end of\nthe film: Loung, having\nescaped the Khmer Rouge,\nis given an opportunity to\nexact revenge on one of\ntheir captured soldiers.\nHer fist clenches and her\njaw tightens, but at the last\nmoment, she relents and\ndecides to spare the man\n\u2013 as do the other refugees\nencircling him. A testament of Loung\u2019s strength\n\u2013 even as a seven-year-old\n\u2013 to reject self-indulgent\nviolence and choose peace\ninstead.\nWith First They Killed\nMy Father, Angelina Jolie\nand Loung Ung have put\ntogether a five-star cast\nand crafted a tour de force\nthat is undoubtedly one of\nthe best films of the year.\nJolie\u2019s decision to focus\non the eyes and raw facial\nexpressions of Loung\nand her siblings, raises a\nmirror to boundless cruelty\nof the Khmer Rouge,\nand paints a captivating\nyet agonising portrait\nof the devastation that\nwar inflicts on children.\nLoung\u2019s confusion as her\nfamily is driven out of\nPhnom Penh; her sorrow\nwhen her father is dragged\naway; and her fear when\ncautiously navigating a\nminefield, earnestly reflect\nthe endless life-defining\nchallenges that millions of\nCambodians faced under\nthe callous savagery of\nthe Khmer Rouge. First\nThey Killed My Father is\na tale of intense hardship\nand miraculous survival;\na tale that honours both\nthose who died and those\nwho survived during the\nCambodian genocide. It\nis a strikingly honest and\nvisceral account of a story\nthat needs to be heard,\nand one that hopefully,\nwill inspire others to tell\nsimilarly important stories\nin the future.\nFirst They Killed My Father\nhas been selected as the\nofficial Cambodian entry\nfor \u201cBest Foreign Language\nFilm\u201d at the 90th Academy\nAwards, and is currently\nstreaming on Netflix.\nA Daughter of Cambodia Remembers // Jolie Pas\nFILM\nMark Aduol\nFilm Editor\nDir: Angelina Jolie.

They were\nwrong. Barry Lyndon is a\nvisual and philosophical\nmasterpiece that, in my\neyes, is Stanley Kubrick\u2019s\ngreatest work.\nAdapted from a 19th\ncentury novel, Barry\nLyndon follows the rise\nand fall of Redmond\nBarry, a young Irish man\nof humble origins who\nmarries into an English\naristocratic family. At the\nbeginning Barry is forced\nto join the British army\nand fight in the Seven\nYears\u2019 War, but he deserts\nthe British and joins the\nPrussian army. After\nfleeing Prussia, Barry\nobtains large amounts of\nwealth through crooked\ngambling and consequently woos and marries an\nEnglish aristocrat, Lady\nLyndon, thereby adopting\nthe name \u2018Barry-Lyndon\u2019. He spends all the\nnoble family\u2019s money on\nalcohol, gambling, and\nexpensive artwork, and\nis ultimately exiled after\nlosing a leg in a duel to his\nstepson.\nKirk Douglas\u2019 character in both Spartacus\nand Paths of Glory is a\nhero driven by idealistic\nmotives, and we can\nresolutely say that he is\nmorally sound. Humbert\nHumbert in Lolita and\nBarry-Lyndon, however,\nis Kubrick\u2019s most\nthought-provoking and\ncomplicated character: it\nis extremely difficult to\nform a resounding opinion\nabout his character as our\nperception and attitude\ntowards him changes\nfrequently and with great\nintensity throughout the\nfilm. Kubrick attempts to\nmanipulate our perception\nof Barry using two simple\nyet ingenious techniques.\nFirstly, a narrator\nconstantly depicts Barry\nin a cold and narcissistic\nlight; he implies that\nBarry lies and deceives\nto fulfil self-aggrandising\nmotives such as when he\nover-spends the Lyndon\nfamily money to gain\na title. However, Barry\nis only deceptive when\nattempting to survive\nand achieve acceptance\nfrom his peers \u2013 from the\nbeginning of the film he is\nan isolated character who\ncraves intimacy and is\nforced to commit immoral\nacts to achieve this.\nSecondly, the camera is\nrepeatedly positioned from\nthe view point of those\nwho surround Barry. We\nare encouraged to adopt\nthe perception of the aristocrats who look upon the\nprotagonist as an outsider\nwho is not worthy of ac-ceptance. Kubrick tries his\nbest to invite us into the\nworld that rejects Barry,\nbut coincidently arouses\ndeep feelings of sympathy\nby displaying Barry as an\noutcast involved in a series\nof ill-fated outcomes. The\nvery name, \u201cBarry-Lyndon\u201d, illustrates the duplicity and lack of identity\nof the protagonist: he is\nboth Irish and English,\nrough and sophisticated,\npoor and rich.\nKubrick masterly\nemployed modern special\neffects in 2001: A Space\nOdyssey \u2013 no other film at\nthe time could create such\nelegant and mesmerising\nportrayals of outer-space\n\u2013 and while the \u201cwarroom\u201d in Dr. Strangelove\nis a relatively simple set,\nevery shot was dramatic,\nunnerving, and at times\nhumorous. Kubrick\u2019s\nfilms all involve incredible camera-work, but the\naesthetically spectacular\nBarry Lyndon is visually\nsuperior to all others.\nThe grandiose and ornate\nrooms of the palaces in\nBarry Lyndon are depicted\nas dark and lifeless, in\ncontrast to the shots of\nrural Ireland, Germany,\nand England, which are\nportrayed as sun-blessed\nagrarian paradises. This\nskilfully illustrates the\ncontrast between the\nsimple, yet naturally beau-tiful, life Barry was born\ninto and the detached, cold\nlife of which he craved to\nbecome a part. Kubrick\nrefused to use artificial\nlight on set and the only\nillumination came from\ncandle-light; this, coupled\nwith frequently motionless\nshots, created scenes reminiscent of an 18th\ncentury\noil painting. The camera\nis briskly taken from the\ntripod during periods of\nviolence, such as when\nBarry brutally flogs his\nstepson in the Lyndon\nestate, highlighting how\nquickly civility can shift\nto barbarism.\nBy creating the\nmonolith in 2001, Kubrick\nportrayed the universe as\na Godless vacuum that is\ncontrolled by an ambiguous mystical force. These\nconcepts of godlessness\nand mysticism are again\nreintroduced into the\nworld of Barry Lyndon but\nin a much subtler respect.\nThe very first scene shows\nBarry\u2019s father dying in a\nduel, and thus throughout\nthe film Barry lacks the\nomnipresent support and\ncomfort that is associated\nwith having a father or\nhaving a God. Barry\u2019s life\nevents are so extraordinary\nthat it impossible they\nhappen by coincidence:\nthere may not be a God\npresent in Barry\u2019s world\nbut there is unquestionably a supernatural force\npulling strings in the\nbackground.\n18th\ncentury Europe\nwas a tumultuous and\nrapidly changing place.\nThe French Revolution\nwas about to give birth to\nthe concepts of equality,\nfraternity, and liberty\nwhich would create the\nopportunity for common\nman to obtain a share of\nhigh society\u2019s wealth.\nBarry possibly represents\nKubrick\u2019s belief that this\nopportunity was a fallacy,\nand if an 18th\ncentury\ncommon man searched for\nwealth they would end up\nisolated, detached and \u2013 in\nthe director\u2019s own words \u2013\n\u201ccut adrift in a rudderless\nboat on an uncharted sea.\u201d\n\u201cRedmond\nBarryLyndon is\nKubrick\u2019s most\ncomplicated\ncharacter\u201d\nAlex in A Clockwork\nOrange may be humorous\nand charming, but they are\nsociopaths driven by their\ninstincts to commit profoundly disturbing acts,\nand it is easy to conclude\nthat they are morally\ncorrupt people.

What\nan absolute\nshame, the\nmess you\u2019ve\nended up in. Weezer was\nhot shit in the \u201890s. The\nBlue Album spoke to a\ngeneration of individuals\nwho felt introverted and\nalone. It was a dorky,\nconfessional, energetic\nmess \u2013 and never once\ndid the heart fail to shine\nthrough. Then, the story\ngoes, you got bored of\nlaying groupies, you were\nlonging for something\n\u201cdeeper,\u201d and you put out\nPinkerton, your last good\nalbum (though it was\nskewered by the critics\nof the day). But, Rivers,\nyour goofy attempts to\nreanimate the band have\nthoroughly alienated your\noriginal fans. If you were\nso aghast at the idea of\nselling out, why did you?\nAfter Pinkerton, the\nband broke up, a hiatus\nthat lasted for five years.\nBut their return, and\nsubsequent albums, were\nnever the same. They seem\nto have lost their target de-mographic, focusing their\nefforts instead on trying\nto make songs that would\nchart \u2013 except they never\nreally did. The dorky fun\nof their old albums was\nabandoned, and replaced\nwith straight-up medioc-rity. The albums are limp\nand flaccid, and have\nnone of the spark that\ncaptivated so many so few\nyears earlier. The lyrics\nwere watered down and\nmeaningless. The guitar\nhad none of the appealing\nquirk. The introduction of\nsome electronic textures\ndid little to appeal to their\nold fanbase and were too\nforced to make it mainstream (and that was a low\nbar in the mid-00\u2019s). They\nwere making music for\nnobody, and they knew it.\nCatching word that a\nnew Weezer album is out\nsoon brings me an eerie\nsense of the passing of\ntime, a kind of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nAt first, there\u2019s a pang of\nexcitement, a nostalgic\nwhat-if-the-old-Weezer-is-back hope that they\u2019ve\nshitcanned their generic\nwashed-out pop sound,\nand are going back to their\nroots, to the ethos that\nmade their first two albums\nso close to my heart while\nI was growing up. Then\nthe singles roll out (strike\none), they post some dorky\nshit on their Facebook\nabout how they\u2019re going\nback to their old sound for\nreal this time (strike two),\nand finally the album in its\nentirety is here, and it\u2019s a\ngeneric washed-out poppy\nmess with no appeal to\neither the mainstream or\nthe last desperately-cling-ing-on fan (strike three).\nThe new album is a\nmess of generic lyrics that\nappeal to nobody, featuring no new musical ideas\nfor the band besides trying\nto sound like a washed-up\npop star trying to mount a\ncomeback, and incorporating absolutely nothing\nappealing to any person\nwith working ears. Try and\nfind a target audience for\nthis album \u2013 you can\u2019t. It\u2019s\nan uncompelling, boring,\nmediocre medley of bland\nguitar sounds and sappy,\nsaccharine, vomit-induc-ing lyrics, with few, if\nany redeeming moments\nin sight. Listening to this\nalbum felt like trying to\nmove my bowels during\na round of intense consti-pation, without the sense\nof accomplishment that\ncomes with finishing up.\nI\u2019d almost, almost rather\nread Atlas Shrugged.\nHere\u2019s a taste of the\nblandness: Rivers collected random snippets\nof lyrics over the past ten\nyears, stuck them into a\nspreadsheet, then hired\nprogrammers to figure out\ninformation like possible\nprogressions and beats\nper minute. This is how\nhe wrote the album. Quoth\nCuomo: \u201cInstead of trying\nto force myself to feel\ninspired, I can just go into\nthe spreadsheet and search\n...I just try them out to see\nwhich ones work magically.\u201d Fuck you, bud.\nPacific Daydream exhausted me to listen to. It\u2019s\nphoned-in pap. I\u2019d rather\nlick roadkill than listen to\nit again. The album has\nless flavor than a cheese\nsandwich, ready-salt-ed crisps, and water\nmeal deal from Tesco.\nThis album is another\nstepping stone in the\nband\u2019s slow march to\nobscurity. Godspeed.\n... and an aktual-ly good album this week\nB\norn in Iran\nand raised in\nLondon, beat\nwizard Ashkan\nKooshanejad, better\nknown by his alias Ash\nKoosha, broke into the\nelectronic scene with\ndebut album Guud in 2015.\nTaking the freneticism of\nFlying Lotus\u2019 signature\nLA beat weirdness further,\nit seemed to spectators\nthat Koosha could do no\nwrong. Guud was a mon-olith, dark and brooding,\ncomplex and suffocating,\nlike Godspeed You! Black\nEmperor ditched the\ninstruments for a MIDI\nkeyboard and a DAW.\nKoosha continued these\nmotifs on his sophomore\neffort, IAKAI, but at a\ndecidedly lower energy\nlevel, without moving\nthe sonic palette forward.\nOn AKTUAL, Koosha\nchannels the earlier energy\nof Guud, while exploring\nnew ground through vocal\nperformances. These sonic\ntextures enable Koosha\nto accomplish more than\nhis earlier efforts \u2013 he\nhits his highest high with\ntrack \u2018TrappistOne\u2019, a\npoised, delicate, and\nslowly-evolving piano\ncomposition that ebbs and\nflows its way to a subtle\nclimax \u2013 denoted by the\nsubtle introduction of a\nsynthesizer into the bass.\nHowever (and unlike\nearlier efforts), the inconsistent textures, sounds,\nand ideas do not complement the disjointed nature\nof this LP. The juxtaposition of more complex IDM\npieces versus the sombre\nvocal performances makes\nAKTUAL feel more like\na string of demos, with\nhighs and lows, but a\ndistinct lack of coherence.\nThe album has lush sonic\nhighs, but entirely misses\nany sense of binding theme\nor narrative, a context for\nany of these compositions.\nAs such, the album is\nreducedtoasetofsketches,\na B-side album from a\nman without the reputation to get away with it.\nI wasn\u2019t sure about the art, but the Japanese writing sold me. // Crush Management\nMUSIC\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Weezer Label: Crush\nManagement / Atlantic\nRecords.

When asked\nabout the rationale behind\nthe changes, he said \u201cwe\ncarried out some research\non Central Library over the\nacademic year 2015/16,\nand found that nobody\nwas actually carrying out\nanything even remotely\napproaching productive\nwork.

For those of\nyou who don\u2019t know, the\nDyson Award is an international award for current\nand recently graduated\ndesign engineering stu-dents, coordinated by the\nJames Dyson Foundation.\nThe main purpose of the\naward is to inspire people\nand get them interested in\ndesign engineering.\nHere is a run through\nmy favourite entries in\ntheir respective categories:\nSustainability\nName: Petit Pli\nDesigner: Ryan Mario\nYasin, Imperial College\nand Royal College of Art\nThe fashion clothing\nindustry is hugely wasteful\nand unsustainable,\nparticularly in terms of\nchildren\u2019s clothing as they\noften grow very quickly -children grow through 7\nsizes in their first 2 years!\n\u201cThe Dyson\nAward is an\ninternational\naward for\ncurrent and\nrecently\ngraduated\nengineering\nstudents\u201d\n\u201cThe cup is a\ndesign that\neffectively\naddresses a\nsimple but\ncommon\nproblem for\nthe elderly\u201d\nPetit Pli is a children\u2019s\nline of clothing, specifically designed with the aim\nof making the children\u2019s\nclothing industry more\nsustainable. It grows\nbidirectionally thanks to\nits permanently pleated\ndesign, expanding up\nto 7 sizes as children\ngrow. Petit Pli is made of\nmachine washable fabric,\nhas a packable one size fits\nall design, and is rain and\nwind proof.

This cup is designed\nto alleviate some of these\nproblems, making daily\ntasks like drinking tea - a\nBritish tradition - easier.\nThe cup is made of\ntwo parts; the lid and the\ncup body. The lid has an\nopening that allows for\nflow controlled drinking,\nminimising the risk of\nspillage. It also includes\na wooden dowel that acts\nas a liquid level marker -floating when the cup is\nfull. The dented middle\nreduces the need for tilting\nwhen drinking, perfect for\nthose with chronic neck\npain. The cup includes a\nweighted base, allowing\nfor greater stability when\nlifted, minimising the\neffect of tremors that are\noften experienced by Parkinson\u2019s patients.\nIt also includes a rubber\nbase, to prevent sliding\nwhen on a surface and\ncushioning if dropped.\nThe cup itself is designed\nto be easy to hold in the\nhand with a rounded lip\nto facilitate comfortable\ndrinking. It is a design\nthat effectively addresses\na simple but common\nproblem for the elderly\nand something the rest of\nus take for granted!\nLifestyle\nBump Mark - bio food\nexpiry label\nDesigner: Solveiga Pakstaite, Brunel University\nThis is one for the\nfreshers out there. Are\nyou tired of buying fresh\nmeat, then forgetting to\ncook it and wondering if\nit\u2019s still safe? We all forget\nthings at the back of the\nfridge and this leads to a\nlot of wasted food. Spare\na thought for those with\nvisual impairments, too.\nHave you noticed that\nalmost all food labels are\nprinted, in tiny ink none-theless? Not great if you\nhave a visual impairment!\nThe Bump Mark design\nhopes to make a tactile\nfood expiry label for meat\nprotein foods.\nThe label has 3 layers:\na bumpy plastic layer\ncovered by smooth set\ngelatin jelly which itself is\ncovered by a plastic layer.\nThe principle is, because\ngelatin is a protein, it\ndecays at the same rate as\nthe meat product within\nthe packaging.

This\ndesign is ingenious\nbecause, not only is it ideal\nfor people with visual im-pairments, it also provides\nfar more accurate expiry\ninformation compared to a\nprinted date!\nThat\u2019s a selection of a\nfew of my favourites from\nthis year\u2019s shortlist for\nthe Dyson Award.

We are determined\nto do just as well this year\nagain, and return to playoffs for another chance\nto move up to the next\ndivision. Unfortunately,\nwe suffered a loss of 42-0\non our first game of the\nseason against the Kent\nFalcons. We gave 100%\non the field and tried our\nbest to push back the Kent\noffence, but with our new\nteam consisting of mostly\nrookies, some mistakes\nwere inevitably made. We\nare, however, taking this\nloss as a learning opportunity to better ourselves\nfor next time. Ben \u2018wears\nred jeans, not a medic,\nstill a\u2019 O\u2019Brien led the\ncharge on offence, doing\nthe best he could to read\ngame and make crucial\ndecisions. He was able to\nlead our offence to gain\ncrucial yardage, but sadly\ndid not manage to attain a\ntouchdown.\nOur defence was also\nstill finding its footing in\nthe first half of the game,\nwith Kent scoring 32\npoints before half time.\nNonetheless, after the\nsecond half we came into\nthe third quarter looking\nstrong; by improvising,\nadapting, and overcoming,\nwe pushed back in the\nsecond half of the game,\nonly letting Kent score 10\npoints.\nTom \u2018where\u2019s your\nball pump\u2019 Smith won the\ndefensive MVP award for\nhis constant hard work and\nperseverance on defence,\nplaying as an outside\nline-backer and stopping\nmany outside runs and\npasses. Tom even played\nvarious offensive downs\nto help the offence. Defensive prowess aside, Tom\u2019s\noffensive plays were also\nincredible, catching out\nKent many times with his\ngreat timing on the rocket\ntoss play.\nGreat consistent plays\nwere also made by David\n\u2018whiffy Dave\u2019 Rovick,\nplaying both offence and\ndefence up until the first\nhalf. However, after the\nfirst half our quarterback\nwas unfortunately injured,\nand David stepped up\nto the role, leading the\noffence. Using his veteran\nknowledge of American\nfootball, David made\ngood reads and lead major\ndrives for the offence.\nA big shout out to\nHarry \u2018Mr. steal your ex\u2019\nLawrence for going 100%\nall game and showing\ngreat leadership in times\nof need for both offence\nand defence. Harry played\noutside line-backer and,\ndespite having an injury\nscare in the third quarter,\nhe gave all he had and\nmanaged to make plays up\nuntil the end of the game.\nThis dedication, paired up\nwith the plays he was able\nto make, managed to win\nHarry overall MVP for the\ngame.\nSPORTS\nInes Ullmo\nWomen\u2019s Team Captain\nSPORTS\nFrancisco Costa\nPublicity Officer\nFrom left to right, back: Coach Marek, Alex, Dan, Florian, Daniel, Francesco, Michael.\nFront: Ezer, William, Valentin, Luca, Bouke.

Great setting from\nLucia Cilloni was key in\nmaking those amazing hits\nhappen.\nDuring the third set,\nsome rotations took\nplace, allowing a newly\ntrained setter, Gemma\nPitotti, to do an amazing\njob at distributing the\ngame, especially between\npositions 4 and 2. Even if\nsome mistakes kept LSE\ncloser during this set, the\nteam stayed confident\nthroughout the whole time\nand ended up winning this\nthird and last set.\nThis first victory was\nextremely important for\nthe team, since they need\nto finish first in the league\nto be promoted to first\ndivision.\nafter multiple potential re-scheduling, ICVC Men\u2019s\narrived at Britannia LC for\nwarm-up at 17:30.

With warm up done,\nthe team ready and a timekeeper with stopwatch\nin hand, it was time for\naction\nWell known for their\ncheerleading skills,\nImperial set off a new\nstandard this year with the\nraucous team cheering the\nteam\u2019s every move at the\nend of the lane, and each\nindividual race seemed\nthe climax of the event.\nEvery time, the excitement would appear to\nbubble on at every photo\nfinish, before being forced\nto reset on the official\u2019s\nseemingly impossible\ndemand for silence at\nachievement for a new\nteam with early-season\nfitness.\nA good swim meet\nwin through Bryce Puszet.\nThis was quickly followed\nby back to back wins by\nCaptain Clara Bachorz\nand Rhys Rickard-Frost,\nand in no time Imperial\nhad already won three\nout of the first six races!\nElectrified by the team\ncheering and carried away\nby impressive victories,\nthe swimmers gave it all\nthey had.

Quickfire relays in every stroke\nwere next up on the list.\nSome expert takeovers,\nspeedy swims including\nor not rubber ducks,\nand slippery swimwear\n(@Richard Prior) saw\nImperial take victories in\ntwo of the races, beating\nUCL in the process. Final\nfinishing position for\nICSWP was 4th\n; a great\nin fact 19 and had just forgotten his ID was clearly\noff. Settling in for the\nbackup plan did include\nsome whining from senior\nmembers of the team (I\u2019m\nlooking at you David), but\nthe meal ended up being\na complete success as the\nteam filled their bellies\nwith tasty pizza from Zizzi\nrestaurant.\nThose leaving already\nloaded onto the train (good\ntry Clara & Clemency), it\nwas time for a night out\nback in the local Spoons.\nPints were drunk, VK\u2019s\nwere downed, and the\ndancefloor gave birth\nto very promising new\ntalents just a few weeks\naway from BUCS. The unexpected news of having\nto push back the leaving\ntime by an hour due to our\ndearest London colleagues\nforgetting about the time\nchange did not affect the\nmood in the slightest.\nIt did however lead to\nadverse consequences\nsuch as \u2018extra dancing\u2019\nand \u2018a dodgy kebab\u2019, as\nwell as a very sleepy bus\nride home.\nArriving back to\nLondon at 4am, everyone\nwas ready for bed. A long\ntube ride home for the\nbravest of the team, or\nelse an Uber, followed by\ncup of milk, and a night\ncuddled up in bed was\nnecessary to recover from\na very exciting day. The\nnight was spent dreaming\nof the next swimming\ngala ICSWP will go to \u2013\nSheffield here we come!\nGreat job to everyone who\nswam, amazing result for\nour first gala, we can\u2019t\nwait for the next one!!\nWant to improve your\nfreestyle technique, or\nsimply try out something new?

In general, the\npath is considered difficult\nto follow, especially its\nascending part, since the\nsurface can be slippery.\nFor me, a beginner hiker,\nvisiting on a late afternoon\naround 6km, which takes\nabout 3 hours in total.\nThe Kalidonia Waterfall\nis two-thirds of the way\nalong the trail \u2013 that\u2019s 2km\nfrom the starting point (or\n1km if you start from the\nother side). The complete\ntrail descends about 350m\n12m, is one the highest\nwaterfalls in Cyprus. The\nname originates from the\ntime the British settled to\nthe island, in 1878. When\nScottish people found\nthe waterfall, they gave\nit the Latin name of their\nhomeland, Caledonia\n(today\u2019s Scotland).\nKalidonia Nature Trail\nThe Cypriot Tourism\nOrganisation has many\nsign-posted natural trails\nin Cyprus, and the Kalidonia Trail is one of them.\nIt\u2019s a linear trail of 3km\nthat starts from an old\nroad between Troodos and\nPlatres, and ends at Psilo\nDentro in Pano Platres.\nYou can also hike the other\nway round if you want,\nbut the signs will show the\nopposite direction. Since\nit\u2019s a linear path, the\ndistance of completing the\ntrail and coming back is\nThe hidden side of Cyprus\nin September, it was just\nabout manageable.\nImpressions\nThe thing that impressed me the most was\nthe fantastic natural beauty\nof the place. I didn\u2019t expect\nit to be so breath-taking. It\nwas terrific walking along\nthe Cold River (Krios\nPotamos) the entire time.\nI wanted to photograph\neverything, and for this\nreason, it took me more\ntime to descend than to\nascend. The only thing\nthat I wished I had done\nearlier was to plan the\nwhole excursion to have\nmore time there. But since\nI hadn\u2019t done that, I didn\u2019t\nmanage to finish the trail:\nI continued my walk only\nuntil I found the Kalidonia\nWaterfall and then started\ncoming back because I\nwas afraid that I wouldn\u2019t\nhave time to return before\nsunset. The whole walk\ntook me almost 2 hours: 1\nhour to reach the Falls and\nthen 45-50 minutes to go\nback.\nEd: For more travel\nstories and tips, visit\nElina\u2019s blog at https://\nempnefsysandtravel.com/.\n\u201cBatman\u2019s Cave\u201d.

There\u2019s no good argument for tuition fees.\nPOLITICS\nAbhijay Sood\nPolitics Writer\nT\nhere is no more\nobvious hot-but-ton issue for UK\nstudents at the\nmoment than tuition fees.\nTheir trebling in the past\nfew years was met with a\nwave of student anger, and\nLabour\u2019s position at the\nlast election \u2013 abolishing\nfees, though not cancelling past debt \u2013 doubtless\nhelped them curry favour\nwith students (though\nit would be ridiculous\nto assert this was the\nsole reason for their\nelectoral success among\nyounger demographics).\nIt\u2019s obvious why students\nmight oppose fees \u2013\nthey\u2019re the ones who end\nup saddled with debt.\nHowever, there are many\nstrong moral and economic arguments against\nthem: reasons to oppose\ntuition fees on the grounds\nof principle rather than\nself-interest.\nThe most obvious\nthing to point out is that\nyou, me, and pretty much\nany other reasonable\nperson already agree that\neducation should be free,\nbut for some reason we\nexclude higher education\nfrom this. As a society, we\ndecided it was better to\nhave a literate population\nthat an illiterate one, and\nprimary education became\nfree and mandatory. We\nthen decided an educated\npopulation would be preferable to an uneducated\none, and so secondary\neducation became free and\nmandatory, and the age at\nwhich we are expected to\nremain in education has\nincreased in proportion to\neconomic advancement.\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen the\nopposite trend in higher\neducation. Both for individuals and for wider\nsociety, this could be extremely damaging; some\nform of higher education\n(though not necessarily\nformal university educa-tion) is steadily becoming\nincreasingly necessary for\ncitizens to compete in an\nadvanced economy.\nThe facile argument that\nit\u2019s somehow fair to charge\nstudents high fees because\nthey have a higher earning\npotential can be dispensed\nwith on individualistic\ngrounds \u2013 students end up\npaying for their education\ntwice, once through fees\nand again through general\ntaxation (fees don\u2019t cover\neverything, and a lot of\nstudent debt gets written\noff). The minimum threshold to pay back tuition fees\nis \u00a321,000, by no means a\nhigh salary, so it\u2019s difficult\nto argue that if you don\u2019t\nreap the financial fruits\nof your education you\u2019ll\navoid debt \u2013 to do so you\u2019d\nhave to live on a wage no\ngraduate would consider\nsufficient, for 35 years.\nHowever, the earning\npotential argument is\nflawed in its premise,\nsince it implies that\neducation has no value\nto anyone other than the\ndegree holder (note the\naforementioned emphasis\non \u2018citizens\u2019 not \u2018graduates\u2019). Everyone benefits\nfrom having an educated\npopulation. You wouldn\u2019t\nexpect firefighters to pay\nfor their training, why\nexpect medics and engineers to do so? Though the\nbenefit of other degrees\nmay be less obvious, it\u2019s\nstill tangible, and thus it\nwould be fairer to fund\neducation as we do almost\neverything else: through\nprogressive taxation.\nThe common argument\nagainst this is the \u201cwhy\nshould people who aren\u2019t\nusing it pay for it?\u201d trope,\nbut ask yourself \u2013 why\nfund roads if you don\u2019t\ndrive a car? Why fund\nhospitals if you\u2019re young\nand healthy? Because\nsomeday, you might need\nto use those services, and\neven if you don\u2019t, you\nbenefit from living in a\nsociety that has them. If\nthat leap can be made for\ninfrastructure and health-care, it should be easily\nenough made for education (perhaps even leading\nus to a National Education\nService). Where do you\nthink the people required\nfor the former are trained,\nanyway?\nThe reticence to fund\neducation through taxation\nrather than fees rests in\nthe commonly held sentiment that the former is\nsomehow more punitive\nthan the latter, but in fact\nthe reverse is true, since\nover the former democracy has some sway, and the\npublic interest, rather than\nindividual interest, can be\nnullified, underscoring\nthe ridiculousness of our\ncurrent high fees.\nThe arguments made\nthus far have rested on\npragmatism, but other\npoints are relevant. For\none thing, tuition fees\nweren\u2019t instituted until the\nlate 1990s: almost all the\npoliticians who now say,\n\u201cit\u2019s impractical\u201d to fund\nhigher education themselves went to university\nfor free. For another, we\nhave to ask ourselves\nhow we want to approach\neducation \u2013 do we believe\nlearning holds any value\nin and of itself, and do\nwe as a society want to\nencourage it wherever\npossible, or only where\nthere is economic benefit\nto be derived. These points\naren\u2019t required to argue\nagainst tuition fees, but\nshould nonetheless not be\nneglected when contemplating education policy.\nArguments for tuition\nfees are rested in the fallacious \u2018fact\u2019 that education\nis only a benefit to the\nholder of the degree and\nnot to the rest of society.\nExamining things holis-tically makes tuition fees\nmuch harder to defend.\nBased on the effect of\ndebt and the benefit an\neducated population has\nfor the economy, it should\nbe argued not that we can\u2019t\nafford to abolish tuition\nfees, but that we can\u2019t\nafford not to.\nIf you agree with this\narticle, or want to berate\nme for my na\u00efvet\u00e9, why not\njoin us at the Free Education Demo next week.\nOur Facebook event is\nImperial Bloc at Free Ed\nDemo.

In an era\nwhere consumer spending\ncould be encouraged\nto stimulate economic\ngrowth, we\u2019ve instead\nseen policies deliberately\ncrafted to increase debt\non students, with ever\nincreasing fees and the abolition of grants.

There is no one\nforcing you to pursue\na higher educational\ndegree, and taking on the\nfinancial responsibility is\na choice that you make.\nWhen you choose to\npursue a degree, you are\nadding significant value\nto your future earnings,\nwith graduates earning an\naverage of \u00a310,000 more\nper year than those who\ndo not attend university.\nIf this experience \u2013 which\ncosts the University a\nsignificant amount to\nprovide \u2013 hands you a\npiece of paper that allows\nyou to command a higher\nsalary for most of your\nworking life, and have a\nfaster and broader career\ntrajectory, why on Earth\nshould it simply be handed\nout? University education\nadds real monetary value\nto your life, and to therefore pay for a high-quality\neducation seems entirely\nreasonable. Again, this is a\nchoice that you make \u2013 if\nyou want a certain career,\nor to earn more money,\nthen you can choose to\npay for three years of University education to fulfil\nthese plans. To selfishly\ndemand that someone else\nshould hand out whatever\nyou think you deserve,\nand fund it by \u201ctaxation of\nbusiness and the rich\u201d (a\nmoronically meaningless\nassertion) is abhorrently\nself-centred. If you think\nit is of value to your life,\npay for it; if you don\u2019t,\nthen don\u2019t. Make no\nmistake that education is a\nprivilege. The fact that we\nare lucky enough in this\ncountry to have primary\neducation and secondary\neducation provided\nfor free has apparently\nnumbed selfish students to\nthis fact, and they are so\nblinded by their inflated\nparameters of what they\ndeserve that they demand\nto have it paid for indeter-minately.\nThe calls in this country\nto abolish university\ntuition fees have outraged\nme beyond just the fact\nthat I think fees are a\nreasonable proposition.\nThe United Kingdom has\nsome of the top universities in the world, and their\nannual costs in relation\nto similarly high quality\nestablishments is eye wa-teringly low. The top four\nuniversities in the world\n\u2013 MIT, Stanford, Harvard,\nand Caltech \u2013 all charge\nin the region of \u00a338,000\nper year. Compare that\nto the next four \u2013 Cambridge, Oxford, UCL, and\nImperial (I think they must\nhave made a mistake in the\nordering of those last two)\n\u2013 which charge \u00a39,250.\nThe standards of learning\nand research across these\ninstitutions is roughly the\nsame, and the career prospects are commensurately\nexceptional. Yet we pay\nover four times less for\nthis privilege \u2013 and we\nthe rich\u2019 \u2013 those fairytale\nbogeymen who already\ndisproportionately prop up\nthe NHS and the welfare\nsystem - to pay for your\ncareer advancement and\nhigher salary.\nTo top it all off, this\ningratitude comes in the\nface of what must be the\nmost generous student\nloans system in the world.\nNot only are our fees\nincredibly low relative to\nthe quality of education,\nbut everyone, no matter\nwhat they study and\nwhere, is guaranteed a full\nloan covering tuition fees\nby Her Majesty\u2019s Government. Then, we only end\nup having to start paying\nthese off once we earn over\n\u00a321,000, and, even once\nthis starts, the repayment\nis capped at 9% of your\nsalary. This means that you\nare only paying back the\nuniversally-granted loan\nyou have been given once\nyou begin to personally\nreap the rewards of the\neducation you have been\nhanded. \u2018Yes\u2019, you might\nargue, \u2018but what if your\nearnings don\u2019t increase?\nThen the education has\ndone nothing for you!\u2019.\nThis may unfortunately\nturn out to be the case,\nbut, if that happens, guess\nwhat? All your debt is\nwritten off after 30 years.\nSo, if your earnings don\u2019t\nrise sufficiently for you to\npay back your education,\nyou just\u2026 don\u2019t pay it\nback. In essence, all you\nare paying for, eventually,\nis the premium value\nadded to your career by\nyour degree.\nTo give you an example\nof just how low the repayments end up being,\nconsider the following\nstudent: they graduates\nfrom a globally-leading\nuniversity, say, Imperial\nCollege, and have total\ntuition debt of \u00a329,485,\nincluding interest accrued\nfees, and the extraordinarily favourable conditions\nunder which we repay\nthem, provide all students\nin this country with an unparalleled opportunity to\npursue a higher education,\nshould they choose to do\nso. Consistently jumping\non the socialist bandwag-on, and demanding more\nand more at someone\nelse\u2019s expense, reflects an\nattitude of entitlement, and\nfrankly total ingratitude\nfor the privilege we are\nbeing offered by our Government and educational\nsystem. I implore you,\ntherefore, not to go to the\naforementioned rally, and\nto appreciate the fortune\nwith which you have been\nbestowed by our University system.\nEducation can serve as a ladder to a higher salary // Pixabay\n\u201cMIT, Stanford,\nHarvard,\nand Caltech\nall charge in\nthe region of\n\u00a338,000\u201d\nduring studies. They get\na great job at the Imperial\naverage graduate salary at\n\u00a337,006 a year. This means\nthat they are paying back\nroughly \u00a3120 a month, or\n\u00a31,440 a year. Assuming,\nextremely conservatively,\nthat their earnings don\u2019t\nincrease at all, they will\npay back the entirety of\ntheir tuition in these small\ninstalments after a little\nover 20 years. In all like-lihood, of course, Imperial\ngraduates will get jobs in\nhigh-trajectory fields, and\nearnings will hopefully\nbe rising of the course of\ntheir careers. If so, they\nwill pay off their debt even\nsooner \u2013 in the region of\njust over 10 years.\nHopefully, it is clear\nthat the size of the total\ncontinue to moan about it?\nHow long will the selfish\ndemands for endlessly\nfree things go unchecked?\nThink about the privilege\nyou are being afforded,\nat relatively nominal\ncosts, and consider how\njustifiable it is to demand\nthat you tax \u2018business and\n\n"

What more\nof a life that was tragically\ncut short, and has remained\nan enigma since?\nIn a newly-published\ntome of never-before-seen\nletters by 20th\n-century\npoet Sylvia Plath, we\nsteal glimpses of a young,\ngifted poet in the making,\nand the window through\nwhich she saw the world.\nThese letters published in\nthe first volume cover the\nletters written from the\ntime Plath was seven years\nold, to her marriage to\nTed Hughes in 1956. The\nsecond volume, covering\nher marriage and separa-tion, up to her death, is due\nnext autumn.\nAs part of the recent-ly-concluded London\nLiterature Festival at the\nSouthbank Centre, four\nwriters gathered on stage\nto discuss the new letters,\na selection of which was\nread by Lydia Wilson.\nThe letters read ranged\nfrom the first one written\nto her mother when Plath\nwas seven, observing the\ndifferences in writing\nwith different coloured\npens, to the one detailing\nthe events surrounding\nher first suicide attempt\nat 20, up to several letters\ndescribing how deeply\nin love she was with Ted\nHughes.\nThe event was chaired\nby writer Lavinia\nGreenlaw, and she was\njoined by writers Eimear\nMcBride, Max Porter, and\nSarah Howe. The writers\ntook turns to discuss\nthe letters, giving their\npersonal takes on what\nthey thought the letters\nrevealed, and how they\nwere relevant to Plath as a\npoet. Each writer then read\ntheir favourite work of\nPlath\u2019s, which turned out\nto be a beautiful juxtaposition of her literary output\nwith the epistolary form.\nThe evening was\nopened with a speech by\nPlath\u2019s daughter Frieda\nHughes, the special guest\nat the event. Reading\nfrom her foreword to\nthe volume, Ms Hughes\npointed out the irony that\nher father has been blamed\nand criticised throughout\nhistory for her mother\u2019s\ndeath, considering that\nhe chose to publish the\ncollection of poetry, Ariel,\nthat would make Plath\nfamous, out of a \u201cmoral\nduty\u201d to the brilliance of\nher work.\nThat all her letters\nin this period has been\npublished unabridged\ninto a huge tome running\nat a whopping 1424\npages, is a testament\nto the high public and\nacademic interest in her\nlife. These volumes aim\nto be a complete, unedited\ncollection of Plath\u2019s\nletters \u2013 a significant effort\nconsidering that most of\nher work was published\nposthumously, edited by\nthe various people close\nto her, including Hughes\nand her mother. Ariel, for\nexample, was edited and\npublished by Hughes after\nher death, and controversy\nhas always surrounded\nhis choice of poems to\ninclude. An earlier volume\nof letters was published by\nher mother, but was put\ndown by critics as being\ntestament to the efforts of\nan overbearing mother,\nwhom Plath, they sug-gested, struggled to free\nherself from.\nAgainst this backdrop\nof strong public and\nacademic interest, The\nLetters of Sylvia Plath:\nVolume 1 seems to rebel\nagainst her cultural image,\nand instead focus on her\nyoung, developing voice,\none that reveals a maturity\nof thought and observation\nwhile dealing with the\nregular events of youth.\nThis volume only hints at\nthe more major events of\nher life and her matured\npoetic voice \u2013 aspects that\nare likely to be the focus\nof the second volume.\nIn a way, this first\nvolume seems to normal-ise the young Plath and\nprovide us with some\ninsight into her developing\npersonality and how it\nmight have contributed to\nthe tragic trajectory of her\nlife.\nFrom the letters, we find\nthe voice of an ambitious\nyoung writer, eager to\nmake it in the world, and\ndetermined to do all she\ncan to succeed. The dark\nside of this drive, however,\nis the self-criticism, the\nhigh expectations, and\nthe inability to cope with\nperceived failure. This\nwas obviously a young\nlady who was aware of her\npotential, and uncompromising in her standards.\nIt reminded me greatly of\nher novel The Bell Jar,\nwhich, of course, is based\non her own experiences.\nAmong these more\nserious issues, however,\nwere more light-hearted\nletters, such as ones\ndescribing how miserable\nEnglish weather was,\nwritten home when she\nwas on a Fulbright scholarship at Cambridge. Apparently, Plath also found\nthe teeth of British men\nappalling.\nLetters are intimate\n\u2013 they are written for a\nspecific audience, and\ncan reveal the writer\u2019s\ninnermost thoughts\nand emotions, giving\nus glimpses of their\ninner lives. But they are\nalso performances in\nthemselves, a selective\ndistillation of one\u2019s life\nand contemplation into\ncrafted pieces that carry\nacross a particular way the\nwriter wants to be seen. It\nis evident even within the\nselection of letters read\nduring the evening that\nPlath became increasingly adept at shaping her\nwritten persona.\nOne never learns about\nPlath\u2019s writing without\nlearning something\nabout her history and\ncultural dominance as\nwell. Her image has been\nmythologised, beatified,\ndemonised, and altogether\nsensationalised across\ntime. If this book does one\nthing, it is to hopefully\nrestore some balance to\nher story, and include her\nvoice in the events of her\nlife that have captured the\npublic imagination.\nNew volume of Plath\u2019s complete letters reveals the mind of a young poet hungry for success\nSylvia Plath with daughter Frieda and son Nicholas, in 1962 // Siv Arb/Writer Pictures\nThe koala bear as a metaphor for life, death, and the\nstruggle to survive\nSwiss writer Lukas B\u00e4rfuss tackles issues of mortality and the meaning of life in his third novel Koala\nBOOKS\nClemens Jakubec\nBooks Writer\nT\nhe animal was\nnot black. It was\nnot strong. It\nwas lazy and had\nfurry ears, a creature, that\npeople laughed about. The\nbest one could say about\nthe animal was, that it\nwas cute.\u201d The koala is\nusually not an animal that\npeople tend to spend a lot\nof time thinking about.\nNevertheless, swiss author\nLukas B\u00e4rfuss decided to\nput it in the center of his\nlatest novel Koala, for\nwhich he was awarded the\nSwiss Book Prize in 2014.\nIt tells the story of an\nauthor who tries to deal\nwith the suicide of his\nbrother. Although they\nhad not been very close,\nhis brother\u2019s sudden death\nstrikes him as something\nincomprehensible. He\ntravels to his hometown,\nwhich he left many years\nago, in order to talk to his\nbrother\u2019s friends and to\nmake sense of what has\nhappened. In his memories\nhe travels back to their\nchildhood. They grew up\nin separate families with\nthe only thing they had\nin common being their\nmother. He recalls how\nduring their teenage years\nat a scout camp his brother\nwas given a nickname:\nKoala. The name that\nwould prove to be an\nomen for the rest of his\nbrother\u2019s life.\nThe storyline then takes\nthe reader back in time, to\na period when the people\nin North America started\nto fight for their independence and the British began\nto colonise Australia. The\nbook gives an account\nof the first settlement of\nBritish criminals who\nwere sent to Australia,\ntheir hopes and fears, their\nsuccesses and struggles.\nAnd amidst all of this\nruns the story of the Koala\n\u2013 the story of an animal\nthat lived unchanged and\nundisturbed for millions\nof years until the first\nhumans arrived and began\nto hunt it.\nB\u00e4rfuss\u2019s precise and\neloquent style, combined\nwith the usage of short\nsentences with very few\nadjectives makes it a\nrelatively easy read. He\ndoes not waste words on\nlengthy descriptions, but\nrather sticks to simple\nstructures. Nevertheless,\n\u201cIt drags the\nreader out of\nhis comfort\nzone and\nforces him to\nface a lot of\nuncomfortable\nissues of life\u201d\nnone of this diminishes\nthe message he tries to\nconvey. In fact, boiling the\nstory down to its essence\nappears to make it even\nmore striking.\nB\u00e4rfuss uses the\nhistory of the koala as a\nmagnificent metaphor for\nour lives or rather for the\nmeaning of life in general.\nHe is not afraid to tackle\nthe big questions. In his\n1942 essay The Myth of\nSisyphus French Nobel\nPrize winnerAlbert Camus\ncomments that whoever\nattempts to explore the\nultimate meaning of our\nlives must inevitably deal\nwith all the discoveries he\nor she makes, regardless\nof whether or not they are\npleasant or not. This is\nexactly what B\u00e4rfuss does.\nHe bravely ventures into a\nrealm that many people\nprefer to leave untouched\nand he confronts the reader\nwith all the consequences.\nOne of the taboos\nB\u00e4rfuss addresses openly\nis suicide. The main character in the book cannot\naccept the suicide of his\nbrother for an almost\nselfish reason. He is a\nfamous and accomplished\nauthor living a fulfilling\nlife, so it is not only\nincomprehensible for him\nhow anybody can commit\nsuicide, but it actually\nupsets him and makes him\nangry, as if his brother\nwould have been under\nsome kind of obligation\nto stay alive, so as not to\nperturb the protagonist\u2019s\nperfect life. On the other\nhand, he also experiences\nhow the people surrounding him deal with the loss.\nWhen the conversation\nshifts to the suicide most\nof them fall silent.

A koala does not\nlive what most people\nwould call an interesting\nlife. It spends the majority\nof its time sleeping, it\nhardly moves, and is not\nconsidered to be highly\nintelligent, not unlike the\nprotagonist\u2019s brother. He\nis unemployed, has never\nleft his hometown, and\nsmokes a lot of weed.\nYet the main character\ncomes to realise that there\nis essentially nothing\nthat makes his life, a life\ngoverned by career goals\nand productivity inherently superior to a \u201cwasted\u201d\nlife like the one lived by\nthe protagonist\u2019s brother.\nTowards the end of the\nbook he thinks: \u201cThe cure\nfor fear is industriousness.\nThe one who is ambitious\nneeds a pair of good legs\nand all those who want to\nbe ambitious but do not\nhave them, must explain\nthemselves. Only the\nstrong ones are able.\u201d By\nfear he means the fear of\nbeing forgotten after death.\nProductivity and ambition\nare the cure prescribed by\nsociety. However, they\ntend to be used as distractions rather than solutions.\nAnother way out of the\nmisery, he realises, is\nlaziness.

When we opened\nlast week\u2019s edition\nof the Felix, we were\ngreeted by an article\nentitled \u201cThe Balfour\nDeclaration: A Century\nOn\u201d. We were eager\nto read on: an opinion\nmost likely opposing our\nown, and written by an\nImperial student \u2013 thus\npresumably logically\nthought out and supported by evidence. What\nbetter way of challenging one\u2019s own beliefs?\nUnfortunately, we got\nas far as the second\nsentence, before I began\nto find unsubstantiated\narguments and sweeping\ngeneralizations.\nThe extent to which the\nauthor misses the central\nbasis of Zionism is clear\nfrom the outset, when\nshe defines Zionism as\na \u201ccause, which aims to\nestablish a safe, Jewish\nhomeland.\u201d Find us\nanother definition of\nZionism that excludes a\nmention of the land of\nIsrael. She goes on to say\n\u201c[Zionism] does not take\ninto account the fact that\ntheir homeland of choice\nwas already inhabited by\nthe Palestinians.\u201d The as-sertion, as it comes across,\nis that the Jewish aspiration for a homeland just\nhappens to focus on Israel.\nIt fails to recognise the\ndeep emotional connection\nbetween Jewish people\nand the region that spans\nmillennia. There is no\nmention of the undisputed\narchaeological evidence\nof Jewish statehood there\ntwo thousand years ago.\nNo mention of the thousands of years for which\nJews have prayed the\nwords \u201cl\u2019shana haba\u2019ah\nb\u2019Yerushalayim\u201d \u2013 \u201cnext\nyear in Jerusalem\u201d.\nOne of the most troublesome tropes the author\nuses, not once but three\ntimes, is the phrase \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d. Not only is this\ndemonstrably incorrect,\nbut it is shamefully hurtful\nto those who have suffered\nsuch atrocities. If Israel\nfollows a policy of ethnic\ncleansing, how would you\nexplain a nearly five-fold\nincrease in the Palestinian\npopulation since 1948? If\nfingers are being pointed,\nthen how do you reconcile\nthe expulsion of 850,000\nJews from nearly all Arab\ncountries in 1948 (leaving\nunder 4,000 remaining),\nwith the 1.4 million Arab\ncitizens that now make up\n20% of Israel\u2019s popula-tion. The author refers to\nthe founders of Zionism\nas \u201cthose who wished for\nthe ethnic cleansing of\nindigenous Palestinians\u201d.\nCan these be the same\npeople that, in 1948, put\ntheir name on the Israeli\nDeclaration of Independence, which states that\n\u201cWe appeal\u2026 to the Arab\ninhabitants of the State of\nIsrael to preserve peace\u2026\non the basis of full and\nequal citizenship and due\nrepresentation\u2026\u201d What\npossible basis does the\nauthor have to make the\nunfounded claim that the\nearly Zionists wished to\ncreate a \u201csolely Jewish\nstate\u201d? On the contrary,\nDavid Ben Gurion (the\nfirst prime minister of\nIsrael) wrote in a letter\nin 1937 \u201cWe do not wish\n\u2026 to expel the Arabs and\ntake their place\u2026 there\nis enough room in the\ncountry for ourselves and\nthe Arabs.\u201d To falsely\naccuse these founding\nfathers of the horrendous\ncrime of ethnic cleansing\nis an inexcusable offense\nto the truth, a commodity\nso precious in the pursuit\nof peace and justice.\nThis forms the basis\nof the problem with the\nother common buzzword\nthat the author brings\nup \u2013 the libellous accusation that Israel is an\n\u201capartheid state\u201d. As\nKenneth Meshoe, a black\nSouth African who lived\nthrough apartheid, puts it,\n\u201cbecause it is so inaccu-rate, it betrays the memory\nof those who suffered\nthrough a real apartheid.\u201d\nThe inconvenient truth is\nthat Israeli Arabs enjoy\nfull and equal rights \u2013\nthere is not a single Israeli\nlaw that singles out Israeli\nArabs, or treats them in\nany way differently from\nother Israelis. It is a frequently ignored fact that\nout of 120 seats in Israel\u2019s\nKnesset (parliament), 13\nbelong to an Arab party,\nthe Joint List. In what\nexample of apartheid does\none see those that are supposedly being discriminated against in positions at\nthe highest levels of law,\nscience and media?\nThe crux of the problem\nissignifiedwhentheauthor\nclaims that the Balfour\nDeclaration supports \u201ctwo\nconflicting and mutually\nexclusive movements.\u201d\nUnfortunately, it is this\ntype of narrow minded\nthinking that presents a\nreal barrier to peace; to\nbelieve that your very\noffer of peace and good\nneighbourliness, and\nappeal to them to establish\nbonds of cooperation\u2026\u201d\nMeanwhile, at the 1967\nArab League summit,\neight Arab leaders agreed\nupon the Khartoum Resolution, which contained\nthe Three No\u2019s: \u201cno peace\nwith Israel, no recognition\nof Israel, no negotiations\nwith it\u2026\u201d\nThe author asserts that\nthe Balfour Declaration\ndid not help those fleeing\nanti-Semitism. Tell that\nto the Jews worldwide,\nincluding those who have\nalready fled anti-Semitism\nfrom across Europe and\nthe Arab Nations, who are\ncelebrating the centenary\nof Balfour, in the knowledge that they are now\nsafe from persecution.\nRather than lamenting\nBalfour, we would argue\nthat we should celebrate it\nfor what it has created \u2013 a\nbeacon of hope for Jews\nworldwide \u2013 and what,\nwith a bit of work, it can\ncreate \u2013 a peaceful contribution to the region.\nReferring to sweeping\ngeneralisations as \u201cwidely\nagreed\u201d facts, and basing\narguments on emotive\nbuzzwords might make\na good story. But when\nsolving a centuries-old\nconflict, that affects the\nlives of millions of people\nevery day, arguments must\nbe based on facts. From\nfirst-hand experience of\ndealing with peacefully\nminded Palestinians and\nIsraeli Arabs, there is no\nneed for Zionism and\nthe quest for Palestinian\nsovereignty to be conflict-ing. Finger pointing and\nlooking for a fight gets\nus nowhere \u2013 working\ntogether, building bridges,\nand seeing each other for\nwhat we are truly worth is\nthe only basis for a lasting\npeace in the Middle East.\nA centuries-old conflict is still raging, despite multiple think-pieces // Flickr/Dennis Jarvis\n\u201cNot only is\nthis claim of\nethnic cleansing\ndemonstrably\nincorrect, but\nit is shamefully\nhurtful\u201d\nexistence must be at the\nexpense of your enemies\u2019\nprecludes any chance of a\npeaceful resolution. Furthermore, it must be noted\nthat in the Israel-Palestine\nconflict this hurtful belief\nis very much one-sided.\nThe Israeli Declaration\nof Independence states\n\u201cWe extend our hand to\nall neighbouring states\nand their peoples in an\n\n"

Joey\nuses the rest of this track\nto expand further on this\nconcept of staying woke,\nwith lyrics like, \u201cSome\nof us woke while some\nstay snoozed// Zombies\nwalkin\u2019 around trippin\u2019\nover issues\u201d serving as a\nmessage that there needs\nto be an awakening of the\nmass consciousness to\nthe social ills prevalent in\nmodern America.\nFOR MY PEOPLE\nfollows and we hear Joey\nembrace his position as a\nleader of the people and\nseek to encourage those\nAmericans afflicted by\nthe corrupt system with\nthe uplifting chorus, \u201cThis\nfor my people, trynna\nstay alive and just stay\npeaceful// So hard to\nsurvive a world so lethal//\nWho will take a stand and\nbe our hero, of my people,\nyeah?\u201d. In an era where\ncountless young artists\nonly rap about women,\ndrugs and money, it\u2019s both\nrare and refreshing for a 22\nyear old to be so socially\nconscious. Joey recognises that a lot of his young\nfans pay more attention\nto rappers than to their\nparents and teachers and\nhe has previously spoken\nabout feeling a sense of\nresponsibility as a young\nartist to therefore spread a\npositive message through\nhis music. Joey\u2019s acceptance of this responsibility\nas a young artist separates\nhim from the other young\nrappers coming up in the\ngame and bars like, \u201cSo\nI thank the Lord when I\nwake up in the morn\u2019//\nCause to inform the world\nthe very reason I was\nborn\u201d allude to this.\nAnother thing that\nsets Joey apart from\nhis contemporaries is\nhis appreciation of 90\u2019s\nhip-hop. I would argue\nthat Joey\u2019s admiration for\nthat era of hip-hop has\nhim described as a \u201cboombap revivalist\u201d whose\nold-school style would be\nmore at home in the 90\u2019s.\nRegardless, Joey stays true\nto his Brooklyn roots on\nthis album by spitting over\nclassic boom-bap beats\non tracks like RING THE\nALARM, which features\nKirk Knight, Meechy\nDarko and Nyck Caution,\nand the Styles P assisted\nSUPER PREDATOR.\nJoey\u2019s old-school vibe\nparticularly shines through\non TEMPTATION. The\nalbum\u2019s third track is one\nofthestandoutsandwefind\nJoey confronting racism,\nprejudice and bigotry. The\ntrack\u2019s intro and outro\nsample a speech given\nby nine year old Zianna\nOliphant at a council\nmeeting in the wake of the\npolice shooting of Keith\nLamont Scott and her\nwords resonate to provide\none of the more poignant\nmoments on the album.\nThe next two tracks,\nLAND OF THE FREE and\nDEVASTATED, were its\ntwo lead singles and they\ncarry on in much the same\nvein sonically as the other\ntracks at the start of the\nally prefer when Joey is\nmore aggressive with his\nflow and spitting bragga-docious, almost ignorant,\nbars (for instance, \u201cGot\ndragon balls like my name\nwas Vegeta\u201d on Christ\nConscious and \u201cCheck\nmy style, check, check,\ncheck it out\u201d on Big Dusty\nfrom his 2015 album,\nB4.DA.$$). This aggressive style of rap is almost\ncompletely neglected in\nthe first half of this album\nand isn\u2019t really heard until\nROCKABYE BABY, the\nScHoolboy Q assisted\nseventh track on which we\nhear Joey proclaim \u201cAnd\nif you got the guts, scream,\n\u2018Fuck Donald Trump!\u2019\u201d.\nRING THE ALARM, the\neighth track and one of\nmy favourites, sees Joey\nat his most boastful and\naggressive as he takes a\nbreak from discussing the\nalbum\u2019s central themes to\ntake aim at trash \u2018SoundCloud rappers\u2019 and the\ngeneral lack of lyrical\nskill in the rap game right\nnow.

For Fans Of:\nA$AP Rocky; ScHoolboy Q;\nKirk Knight. 50 minutes\nALL-AMERIKKKAN\nBADA$$\nand its opening lines,\n\u201cYeah (wake up, wake\nup)// Free your mind (I\nsaid wake up)// Good\nmorning Amerikkka//\nGood morning Amerikkka\n(I said wake up)\u201d. The\necho of these lines sounds\ninnocuous and subtly\nintroduces the album\u2019s\ncentral recurring theme of\n\u2018staying woke\u2019. \u2018Staying\nwoke\u2019 is defined as \u201cbeing\nalbum. That\u2019s to say that\nall the tracks in the first\nhalf give more relaxed,\nreflective and nuanced\ncritiques of the American\npolitical establishment.\nHowever, in my opinion,\nthe first half of the album\nis markedly weaker than\nits second half. I person-perhaps worked against\nhim in the past and seen\n\u2018Dis Generation\u2019 from\nA Tribe Called Quest\u2019s\n2016 album We got it from\nHere\u2026 Thank You 4 Your\nservice and he\u2019s already\ncemented his place as one\nof the most skilled lyricists\nof our generation, going\ntoe-to-toe with the elusive\nJ. Cole with ease on the penultimate track LEGENDARY. In my opinion, Joey\nhas the potential to reach\ntop five status in today\u2019s\nrap game but, in order to\nreach the upper echelon\nof rap (with Kendrick\nLamar, Drake, J. Cole and,\nmore recently, Chance The\nRapper to name a few),\nJoey needs to find a way to\nbetter marry his reflective\nside with the boisterous\nbars featured in the second\nhalf of the album. He does\nthis to perfection on the\ntenth track, the Chronixx\nassisted BABYLON. Joey\u2019s\nanger and sheer emotion at\nthe injustice dealt by the\nAmerican government can\nbe felt through every bar as\nwe hear him scream, \u201cTurn\non CNN, look at what I see\nagain// It\u2019s another black\nman, died at the white\nhand of justice// To tell\nthe truth man, I\u2019m fucking\ndisgusted\u201d, \u201cNowadays\nthey hangin\u2019 us by a\ndifferent tree// Branches\nof the government, I can\nname all three// Judicial,\nlegislative and executive\u201d\nand \u201cIf black lives really\nmattered, you niggas\nwould do something\u201d.\nJoey concludes the\nalbum with AMERIKKKAN IDOL, a six-minute\nthriller on which he\ncompletely denounces the\nmedia, American government and criminal justice\nsystem and delivers a\nchilling warning to the\nlisteners- \u201cDevisin\u2019 plans\nwhile you sleepin\u2019, I\u2019m\njust trynna stay woke\u201d.\nThe track is effectively\nthe culmination of Joey\u2019s\nmusings on the themes\nand subject matter\ndiscussed throughout\nthe album, with Joey\ntouching on everything\nfrom police brutality and\npolitical corruption to\ngangs, black-on-black\nviolence and mass incar-ceration. The last verse in\nparticular is outstanding\nand it arguably carries the\nmost important message\nof a mainstream hip-hop\nverse thus far in 2017.\nThis message highlights\nthe conspiracy theory that\nthe U.S. government is\nusing media and political\npropaganda in an attempt\nto \u201cstart a Civil War\nwithin the USA amongst\nblack and white and those\nalike\u201d, and serves as a call\nto action to those young\npeople experiencing\nsystematic oppression in\nAmerica.\nOnly time will tell\nwhether this album will\nprove to be a \u201ctimely and\ntimeless masterpiece\u201d, as\nJoey described it in his\nHot97 interview. Although\nhe could stand to make it\nmore cohesive to better\nreflect all aspects of his\nartistry (he almost sounds\nlike two different artists\nat different points on the\nalbum), in ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$ Joey\nsucceeds in delivering an\nimpressive sophomore\neffort with an important\nmessage.\nhimself as \u201cthe double\nentendre monster\u201d and de-claring, \u201cResurrection of\nreal, you niggas fake\u201d on\nthe chorus. In an interview\nwith Hot97, Joey describes\nthis album as \u201cvegetables\u201d\nin an industry with a lot of\n\u201ccandy and fast food\u201d. He\nsees his peers producing\neasily digestible music\nwhich lacks substance but,\nin ALL-AMERIKKKAN\nBADA$$, Joey has chosen\nto craft a project which is\n\u201cgood\u201d for the listener.\nJoey was ordained as\none of this generation\u2019s\n\u201cgatekeepers of flow\u201d by\nthe legendary Q-Tip on\nALL-AMERIKKAN BADA$$ // Pro Era/Cinematic\n\u201cWe hear Joey\nproclaim\u201cAnd\nif you got the\nguts, scream\n\u2018Fuck Donald\nTrump!\u2019\u201d\nLike what you see?\nWant _more_?\nTune into 2 Gs in\na Pod - a new weekly\npodcast \u2013 bringing\nvibes and discussing\nall things culture\nFridays at 3pm, or\ncatch up on SoundCloud or IC Radio!\n\n"

Bring a large pan of salted water to the\nboil\n2. Cut off the florets of broccoli and slice\noff the woody outer layer of the stem. Cut\nthe stem into small chunks.\n3. Place the broccoli into the boiling water\nand cook for around 10 minutes, until tender.\n4. While the broccoli is cooking, heat the\noil in a frying pan and gently fry the garlic and chilli until the garlic is aromatic and\ngolden \u2013 don\u2019t let it burn!\n5. Remove the broccoli from the pan with a\nslotted spoon or sieve and add to the hot oil,\nstirring around to break it up.\n6. Boil the pasta in the broccoli water according to packet instructions. Continue to\nstir the broccoli until it breaks down into a\nsmooth sauce. Add some pasta cooking water if it looks dry.\n7. Drain the pasta and toss through with the\nbroccoli sauce. Serve with parmesan.\nI\nf there was ever an\nargument for the\ninherent goodness\nof humanity and the\nprogress of mankind, it\ncan be summed up in a\nsingle word: pasta. This\nhumble staple of our diet\nis probably one of the\nbest reasons to be alive\non this earth. Whether it\u2019s\nlong, worm-like spaghetti\ndrenched in a carbonara\nsauce, or the old workhorse penne paired with\nbasil pesto, there is little\nthat\u2019s more comforting\nafter a long day.\nPasta can even have\nProustian qualities:\nnothing takes me back to\nchildhood faster than a\nbowl of delicate farfalline\ncoated in my mum\u2019s\ntomato sauce. We used to\ncall it \u2018baby pasta\u2019, and it\nwould be a special treat\nto comfort us on cold\nnights, or after time away\nfrom home. And the time\nI ate so much lasagne I\nmade myself physically ill\nhas gone down in family\nhistory.\nI am sure that pasta has\nsuch associations for a lot\nof people, evoking a sense\nof warmth and familiarity.\nWhile pasta can hold\npersonal meaning for the\nindividual, it also takes on\na wider cultural meaning:\ngeographically, you can\ndivide Italy into different\npasta regions, from Sardinian fregula \u2013 round\nballs of semolina similar\nto couscous \u2013 to the\nTuscan pici, whose thick\nshape resemble small\nsnakes; you can also travel\nthrough history, seeing\nhow pasta reflects the age\nin which it was made,\nwith sheets of lasagne\nemerging very early, and\ncomplex shapes like radi-atori and rotelle \u2013 almost\nFuturist in their evocation\nof machinery \u2013 requiring\nsophisticated equipment.\nFinally, there\u2019s the\nsheer linguistic joy that\ncan come from pasta\nshapes: you may know\nthat penne comes from the\nword for pen, and farfalle\nis named after butterflies,\nbut what about gigli, ziti,\nor \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 strozzapreti, which\nmeans \u2018priest-stranglers\u2019,\na name whose etymology\nremains hotly contested.\nNow that I\u2019ve finished\nthis little ode to my favourite carb, it\u2019s time for\na few recipes that can help\nyou shake up your pasta\nroutines:\nBIGOLI IN SALSA\n\u2022 One white onion,\nthinly sliced\n\u2022 One tin of anchovies\nin olive oil\n\u2022 Splash of vermouth,\nor other dry wine\n\u2022 Knob of butter\n\u2022 Long pasta, e.g.\nbigoli, spaghetti,\nlinguine\n1. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil.\n2. Heat the olive oil from the anchovy tin\nin a frying pan over a low heat and add the\nonions.\n3. Fry the onions gently until very soft \u2013\nabout 15 mins \u2013 and then add the anchovies,\nstirring so they melt.\n4. Once the anchovies have melted, add a\nsplash of vermouth and reduce down. Meanwhile, cook the pasta to packet instructions.\n5. Drain the pasta and toss through with the\nanchovy-onion sauce, plus a knob of butter.\nPUTTANESCA\nAn alleged favourite of\nItalian courtesans (this\nis in no way true, but\nyou can\u2019t beat a good\norigin story), it\u2019s been a\nlong staple of mine for the\nsimple reason that most of the\ningredients come in tins.\n\u2022 One tin of anchovies\nin olive oil\n\u2022 2-3 cloves of garlic,\ncrushed\n\u2022 Pinch of chilli flakes\n\u2022 One tin of tuna\n\u2022 Handful of black\nolives, sliced\n\u2022 Handful of capers\n\u2022 One tin of chopped\ntomatoes\n\u2022 Your favourite kind\nof pasta\n1. Begin by heating the anchovies slowly\nin a frying pan, with their oil. Once they\u2019ve\nmelted, add the chilli and garlic, and fry until aromatic.\n2. Add the drained tuna, the olives, and the\ncapers. Stir until it is all mixed up.\n3. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes, turn\nthe heat to low, and simmer for 30-40 minutes until the sauce is thickened and re-duced.\n4. Cook pasta according to packet instruc-tions, and toss through with the sauce.\n5. Serve with plenty of parmesan.\nFOOD\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\n30\nThis is a classic dish\nfrom the Veneto region of Italy, which\nmakes liberal use of\none of my favourite\ningredients: ancho-vies. Traditionally it is\nserved with bigoli \u2013 long,\nhollow tubes of pasta. They\u2019re found\nin specialist shops, but if you can\u2019t get\nany spaghetti is a good replacement.\n\n"

She is also one of\nthe most prolific, having\nappeared in more than\n110 films since her debut\nin 1971. The superlatives\ncontinue ringing, with\nHuppert also the most\nsuccessful actress in the\nhistory of France\u2019s Cesar\nAward, with 16 nomina-tions, as well as the most\nnominated in history for\nits theatre equivalent, the\nMoli\u00e8re Award, with 7\nnominations (Huppert is\nactually a very prominent\nstage actress too, and\nappeared in a 2014 Sydney\nTheatre Company production of The Maids opposite\nCate Blanchett, which just\nsounds to die for). 2016\nwas the year that Huppert\ncame to prominence with\nmainstreamaudiences,fol-lowing up her role as professor redefining herself in\n\u201cBlanchett\ndelivered\ntwo of the\nfinest lead\nperformances\nin recent years\nwith 2013\u2019s\nBlue Jasmine\nand 2015\u2019s\nCarol\u201d\nAlejandro Gonzalez\nInarritu, Steven Soderbergh, Terrence Malick,\nand Ron Howard.\nthe face of divorce, with\none of the greatest performances of the century\nas the \u2018post-feminist\u2019\nowner of a video game\nproduction company who\nrefuses to allow her rapist\ncontrol her life and shape\nher world, fighting back\nto devastating effect.\nHuppert\u2019s filmography is\nintimidatingly brilliant\n\u2013 this woman is literally\ncapable of anything.

Nicole Kidman\nBest Performances:\nTo Die For, Birth, Dogville, Moulin Rouge!,\nThe Others, The Hours\nBorn in Hawaii, Australian Nicole Kidman is\none of the busiest actresses in the world, and is at\nthe peak of her powers\nright now in 2017. Her\ncareer began in the early\neighties, and she made\nher Hollywood debut\nopposite Tom Cruise in\nDays of Thunder in 1990.\nThe two would fall in love\nand were quickly married.\nWhile there were some\ngood performances from\nKidman in the nineties,\nmost notably her Golden\nGlobe-winning turn in Gus\nvan Sant\u2019s To Die For and\nanother role with Cruise in\nthe great Stanley Kubrick\u2019s\nfinal film, Eyes Wide Shut,\nit was always felt that she\nwas performing within\nherself, and that she was\ncapable of much more. It\nwas only following her\ndivorce from Cruise in\n2001 that she really began\nto explore the depths of\nher talent. While still\nstarring in commercially\nsuccessful films, Kidman\nbranched out into daring\nindependent dramas with\ninteresting international\nfilmmakers, working with\nthe likes of Lars von Trier,\nJane Campion, Park Chan\nWook, Werner Herzog,\nSofia Coppola, and Yorgos\nLanthimos. This brave\nattitude gave her instant\nsuccess, earning back-to-back Oscar nominations\nfor Moulin Rouge! and\nThe Hours, and winning\nfor the latter. She is currently enjoying a renais-sance, and in the last year\nalone she has dominated\ntelevision with Big Little\nLies and Top of the Lake,\nas well as returning to the\nacademy circle with a supporting actress nomination\nfor Lion. At the Cannes\nfilm festival this year she\nhad three films debut, as\nwell as a television series,\nleading her to receive a\nspecial award for its 70th\nanniversary, in recognition\nof her incredible form.\n\u201cWe never\nquite know\nwhat\u2019s going\non beneath\nher expressive\neyes \u2013 she\u2019s\nalways in\ncontrol\u201d\ndouble amputee, a factory\nworker plagued by mental\nhealth issues and desperately fighting to keep her\njob, a devious World War\nII spy, a Polish immigrant\nin 1920s New York and\nLady Macbeth. Cotillard\nis able to play the weak\nand the strong with equal\npoise, each and every one\nof her characters laced\nwith a mystery. We never\nquite know what\u2019s going\n4. Julianne Moore\nBest Performances:\nBoogie Nights, Magnolia, Safe, Far From\nHeaven, Still Alice, The\nHours\nJulianne Moore first\ngrabbed critics\u2019 attention\nin Robert Altman\u2019s Short\nCuts, and managed to establish herself as a leading\nlady in Hollywood in the\nlate nineties, with her best\nperformances coming\nunder two very different\nfilmmakers: Todd Haynes\nand a young Paul Thomas\nAnderson. Specialising\nin portraying sensitive,\ntroubled women, Moore\nwas perhaps at her best in\n2002, when she garnered\nOscar nominations for\nboth Best Actress and\nBest Supporting Actress,\nfor Far From Heaven and\nThe Hours respectively.\nShe has continued to\nalmost always be the best\npart of the films she was\nin throughout her career,\nworking with prestigious\ndirectors in Anderson,\nAltman, Haynes, the Coen\nBrothers, Alfonso Cuaron,\nand David Cronenberg.\nShe had a second peak of\nsorts in 2014 when she\nwon the best actress award\nat Cannes for Maps to\nthe Stars, and then finally\n\u201cMoore plays\nseventies porn\nstars, paranoid\nhousewives,\nand ailing\nprofessors with\nequal aplomb\nand her own\nunique voice\u201d\non beneath her expressive\neyes, and that\u2019s because\nshe is always in such\ncontrol of that information\n\u2013 a puppet master posing\nas an actress.\nclaimed an Academy\nAward at the fifth attempt\nfor Still Alice.

FXU apologised\nfor any confusion.\nenjoyed for many more\nyears to come.\u201d\nThe Bottle Match is\nan annual varsity match,\ntraditionally held in February, between CSM and\nRSM, one of Imperial\u2019s\nsix constituent unions. It is\nthe second-oldest varsity\nmatch in the country, with\nthe first match being held\nin 1902. The petition says\nthe match has been held\neach year, except during\nWorld War I.\nThe petition, which at\nthe time of writing had\nmore than 3,500 signa-tures, states that playing\nunder CSM \u201cgives us a\nsense of belonging to a\nwider community\u201d, and\nthat the Bottle Match is \u201ca\nculmination of over 100\nyears of a legacy which\nunifies both players and\nsupporters alike\u201d. It also\nsays the Bottle Match\n\u201chas become a huge part\nof Cornish history\u201d, and\nit holds importance for\n\u201cevery Cornish rugby\nplayer, CSM alumni, and\nspectator\u201d.\nThe petition attracted\na number of supportive\ncomments: one signator\nwrote \u201cI competed in the\nBottle Match twice (in\n2010 and 2011) and it was\none of the highlights of my\ntime at university\u201d, while\nanother described participating in the Bottle Match\nas \u201cone of my fondest\nmemories with friendships\nformed that have stood the\ntest of time\u201d.\nInitially only the rugby\nteams participated, but\nover the last ten years the\nnumber of teams included\nhas increased, including\nhockey, netball, and foot-ball, among others. The\nmatch takes its name from\na three-foot tall tin bottle\nthat was taken from the\ntop of a Bass-Charrington\nlorry by RSM students in\n1926. The rugby match\nalone determines which\nside will take home the\nbottle: this year the bottle\nwas won by RSM, following a 36-19 victory over\nCSM.\nCSM was founded in\n1888 in Camborne, Cornwall, which was formerly\na centre for the Cornish\ntin-mining industry. It was\nmerged with the University of Exeter in 1993, and\nmoved to a new campus\nin Penryn, Cornwall, in\n2004.\nIn a statement, the\nFXU said \u201cthere is much\nconfusion over how clubs\nbrand themselves\u201d, with\na number of names being\nused by sport teams and\nclubs. They said: \u201cIn any\nmoves forward, FXU will\nbe considering our various\nclubs and societies\u2019\nhistory, heritage and the\nviews of all our students\nin order to find a solution\nthat works and supports\nthe overall student experi-ence. We look forward to\nhaving these discussions\nwith our many stakeholders.\u201d\nFXU also said that the\nCSM Student Association\nhad been temporarily\nsuspended, pending investigation into the \u2018PPE\u2019\nsocial, which saw students\nwearing high-vis jackets\nwith slogans such as \u2018I\nlove rape\u2019.\nThe bottle is back (it never left) // RSM RFC\nBottle Match to go ahead, following uncertainty over\nits future\nIn a statement released\nfollowing the announce-ment, CSM RFC said:\n\u201cOne thing is clear: we\nmade a loud statement and\nit was heard. Everyone\nat CSM sport would like\nto thanks the amazing\nsupport and kind words\nfrom the student body,\nalumni, local community,\nand beyond.\u201d\nA representative of\nRSMU spoke to Felix,\nsaying \u201cwe couldn't be\nhappier that such a historic\noccasion has not only been\nconfirmed for this year,\nbut \u2013 with nearly 3600 signatures on the petition \u2013 is\nnow in a stronger position\nthan ever to continue on\ninto the future. Bottle is\nalways a highlight for\nundergraduates, postgrad-uates, and alumni alike ...\nWe hope it can be something that continues to be\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

Playing\nlacrosse of course!\nThe Men\u2019s 2s gathered\nat around midday, ready to\ngrab their sticks and take\nthe banter-filled minibus\nup to Hertfordshire.\nHaving forgotten the\ncold rains of Saturday\u2019s\ntraining, the squad descended upon the pitch\nand set themselves up\nagainst their first opponents in their league of\nfive: UEA. After bagging\nthe equaliser for the 2s in\nhis previous BUCS game,\nKhris Delizo marked his\nreturn to the lacrosse pitch\nby scoring twice against\nUEA, winning us our\nfirst game. The victories\nfollowed quickly: another\nwin against Warwick, with\nMike McGill scoring his\nfirst goal of the season,\nand Khris backing himself\nwe held Brunel to a draw.\nOne may argue that these\nvictories were a result of\nour two coaches Ben Reed\nand Ross Unwin, players\nfrom the Men\u2019s 1s who\ncame to see how the 2s\nhave progressed so far in\ntheir first month.\nWith a speed gun\nhanded over to the men,\nit was only natural that\nwe would stroke our\negos, having smashed our\nleague, and compete to see\nwho had the fastest shot.\nBen proved he had\nthe fastest shot with an\n89-mph shot and the 2s\nresident shot maniac,\nKhris came second with\nan 80-mph shot.\nThe time had come \u2013\nunbeknownst to the Men\u2019s\n2s, this semi-final would\nbe their final game of the\nday. But against the might\nof the home team, the\nHertfordshire Comets, the\nMen\u2019s 2s put up a valiant\neffort. There were some\namazing checks from the\nfresher long pole Sebastia\nRamon, who is shaping\nup to quickly steal the\nclub spot of best d-pole,\nand quality dodges from\nCharles Ingham as he\ngracefully dodged the\nopposition\u2019s defence. Matt\nCowley also stepped up\nto be our face off and get\noff (FOGO) champ as he\nstepped up to do the face-off.\nWith the day drawing\nto a close, the skies were\nalight with fireworks,\nbrightening up the night\nsky as the Men\u2019s 2s\nreturned to London, filled\nwith the pride of their\nvictories and the drive\nto smash the rest of their\nseason.\nWomen\u2019s Lacrosse at the Jan Kiddle Cup\nT\nhe Jan Kiddle\ncup is a development tournament\naimed at players\njust starting out at lacrosse,\nencouraging improved\nstick skills and game play.\nIn the early hours of\nSaturday, 4th\nNovember\nstood a crowd of lacrosse\nfreshers, ready to smash\nthe day ahead. Morale\nstarted out low as we\narrived in muddy Hitchin\nwith torrential rain. But as\nthe tournament began, the\nweather was forgotten and\nlacrosse was the only thing\non our minds. Our first\ngame against Kent saw\nfirst-time goals from many\nof our freshers \u2013 leading\nto a glorious 3-2 victory!\nThe matches following\nare a little unclear, as the\nadrenaline and excitement\nof each game fogged the\nmemory. After our initial\nvictory, we won another\ngame, drew one and lost\none \u2013 making it into the\nsemi-finals!\nThe final five minutes\nin our semi-final game\nagainst Kent was one of\nour most intense plays to\ndate. The desire for victory\nwas clear. With only a\ncouple minutes remaining,\na phenomenal goal from\nour fresher secured our\nplace in the final against\nCentral London.\nThe final game against\nCentral London was the\nbest both freshers and\nseniors had played in a\nlong while. Our defence\nboxed out the other team\nfor the entire match,\nleading to overtime, then\ngolden goal. Eventually\nthe strain of an entire day\nof lacrosse hit and our wall\ncracked, letting Central\nLondon take the cup.\nAs the day ended, the\nskies lit up as brightly\nas our smiles. It was\na phenomenal day of\nlacrosse, which saw such\nan improvement in game\nplay and stick skills\nalike from all players.\nA massive shout-out to\nHitchin for such a fantastic day, the other teams for\nSPORTS\nAnthony Onwuli\nMen\u2019s 2s Captain\nSPORTS\nZoe Chu\nWomen\u2019s 2s Vice Captain\nMen\u2019s 2s after smashing their league // IC Lacrosse\n\u201cThe final five\nminutes in\nour semi-final\ngame against\nKent was one\nof out most\nintense plays\nto date\u201d\ngreat games, and \u2013 most\nimportantly \u2013 the Imperial\nLadies\u2019 2s for such great\nlacrosse!\n\u201cThe iron\nwall of the\nlong pole\ndefence shut\nout any shots\nfrom Brunel\u2019s\nopposition\u201d\nwith two more goals\nagainst Lincoln.

After\ntwo close losses last\nseason, the squad was in\nthe mood for revenge.\nKicking off at a delayed\ntime of 15:00, the match\nstarted perfectly: a reclaimed kick off, followed\nby a barrelling run by\nresident sleeve-stretcher\nMartin Head, led to us\nmaking quick inroads into\nthe Brunel half. Several\nphases of linking play\nlater and Marin Tuleu\nwent over in the corner.\nWith Field adding the\nextras, we were 7-0 up.\nHowever, we could not\nmaintain the high work\nrate and were soon back\ndefending in our own half.\nBrunel\u2019s wide attacking\nplay was proving effective\nin piercing our line, and\nafter some forward pod\nphases they whipped the\nball out and went over in\nthe corner. The kick was\ngood, and we were all\nlevel. At this point Brunel\nhit their stride, and the\nlast 20 minutes of the half\nwent in such a manner\nbest not described here, or\nat least not by me. Let\u2019s\njust say that, as half-time\narrived, Brunel had built\nup a 21-7 lead, and we\nwere not happy.\nWhat followed was the\ngrittiest half of rugby the\n1st XV has played in many\na match. 20 minutes of the\nsecond half went by and\nBrunel didn\u2019t have a single\nphase of possession. The\nline-outs were firing on\nall cylinders, the driving\nmauls were tearing them\napart, and the backs were\ninterlinking perfectly.\nWith the constant thought\nof maintaining his wavy\nlocks with curl cream\nno longer on his mind,\ncaptain-of-the-bench\nAllingham burrowed over\nfrom short range for a\nclassic front-row-union\ntry. Marin dotted down for\nhis second before Brunel\nfinally got the ball back.\nAt this point, the tries\nwere flowing, and Brunel\nattempted to reassert their\nhold on the match with a\nconverted try followed by\na penalty. They led 31-21.\nHowever, the momentum\nremained with us; DPFS\nBlackett, spurred on by\nhis indignation at the\nhate he has received for\nthe introduction of Bud\nLight, sniped around the\nruck and went over. 31-26.\nSeveral minutes later and\na peel from the back of\na mall saw Will Aynsley\nbust over the line. With\nthe conversion, we now\nled 33-31. However, it\nwas not to be. A late try\ndown the blindside, compounded by a last-play\ninterception try by Brunel\nsaw them snatch it away\nfrom us, final score 43-33.\nSo close but yet so far.\nTo stay up to date with\nthe team, follow us on\nInstagram @IC_rugby\nO\nn the 20th\nof\nOctober, the\nImperial windsurfing Team\nadventured to the confined\nlands of Devon to participate in the biggest Student\nWindsurfing Festival\nof the year: the Student\nWindsurfing Association\u2019s\nAussie Kiss!\nEverything looked\nperfect \u2013 360 windsurfers\nfrom all over the UK were\nabout and ready to go. But\nit wasn\u2019t until we got there\non Friday night that we\nrealised just how muddy\nand windy it was \u2013 a classic\nBritish camping weekend.\nBut the big party tent was\nready and so were we! The\nnight was starting to get\nenergized and the team\nwere enjoying themselves,\nbut it was an early-ish\nbedtime as the forecast for\nthe weekend was BIG.\nSaturday morning, we\nrigged up the kit up and\ndonned our wetsuits. The\nwind was howling and\ngusting at 40 knots, with\nthe forecast only set to\nget worse. Everyone was\nhyped, and suitably scared\nfor their lives, but the team\nwent out and had some fun\nin a rather windy lake. We\ncould see windsurf freesty-lers spinning and turning\nand landing moves, miraculously keeping their\nfeet on the board. Unfortunately, the tents were not\ndoing so great in Storm\nBrian and half the team\nwere preparing to sleep in\nthe minibus. This was not\ngoing to stop us \u2013 we came\nhere to windsurf!\nThe day ended without\ncasualties and with big\nsmiles on very tired faces\nas we headed to the local\npub to dry up a bit. We\nknew it was going to\nbe a rough night on the\ncampsite with many tents\nblown down. But after\ndrying up we were ready\nto get on the fancy dress\nand head to the main party\ntent. This year the theme\nwas Sweet 16: Spoiled\nRotten. The team always\nlikes to be noticed and\ncertain (male) members\nlooked dashing in some\ndresses! We celebrated\nand partied like there was\nno tomorrow, happily in\ndenial that Sunday existed.\nCome the last day, competition time. The wind\nwas not as extreme as\nSaturday, although people\nwere quite happily blasting\nalong. The Imperial\nAdvance Racing Team,\nconsisting of Horacio Cox,\nRaph Zufferey, and Alix\nFouche, took to the water\nand completed their heat\nin second place, but did\nnot make the final. Finally,\nthe freestyle racing took\nplace, unfortunately\nwithout any big planing\nmoves as the wind didn\u2019t\npick up.\nAll in all, it was a\nfantastic (and quite wet)\nweekend; a fantastic start\nto Imperial\u2019s windsurfing\nseason!!\nIf you want to get\ninvolved (no prior experience needed), on the\n24th\n-26th\nof November\nthe Team are heading to\nLiverpool to compete in\nbeginner, intermediate,\nadvance and team racing.\nTuition is also available\nfor all abilities.

This\nresearch is the first of its\nkind to determine whether\ninjection of plasma from\nyoung individuals to the\ncognitively impaired can\nimprove the symptoms of\ntheir disease.\nPreviously, work has\ntypically focused on mice\nin parabiosis studies,\nwhich is when the circulatory systems of two mice\n(old and young) are joined\ntogether. The results of\nthis initially suggested the\nrejuvenation properties\nof young blood in older\nmice. Research published\nin 2014 then went on\nto show that parabiosis\nstudies were unnecessary\nand when aged mice were\nexposed to young blood\nplasma, brain ageing was\nreversed at a molecular,\nstructural, and cognitive\nlevel.\nThis new human\ntrial was conducted by\nAlkahest, based in San\nCarlos, California. The\nclinical trial was led\nby Tony Wyss-Coray,\nfounder of Alkahest and\nneuroscientist at Stanford\nUniversity in California,\nand Sharon Sha, another\nStanford neurologist.\nTheir aims were to\nresearch the feasibility of\nsuch a study in humans by\nmonitoring the tolerability\nof the infusions from 18-30\nyear old donor patients\ninto patients with mild\nto moderate Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease. Cognition, functional ability, and mood\nwere also monitored to\ndetermine if there was any\nchange.\nPatients were either\ninfused with young\nplasma over four weeks\nor a placebo containing\nsaline. Initial results\nsuggested that the young\nplasma was safe and well\ntolerated in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients. In\nstudy highlighted that\nresults should be considered with caution due to\nthe small size of the trial\nconsisting of only 18 par-ticipants. Despite this they\nremain hopeful that these\nfindings show significance\nand that we may be one\nstep closer to improving\nblood transfusion trials\nin humans. They say \u201cthe\nresults are promising and\nwarrant further exploration of young plasma\nin future, larger, double\nblinded clinical trials.\u201d\nDespite the positive\nfindings there have been\nethical concerns about\nsimilar trials charging high\nparticipatory fees. One\nsuch company, Ambrosia,\nis charging $8,000 for\nover 35s to receive blood\nfrom under 25s, even\nthough it is far from clear\nwhether this method\nwill work. Additionally,\nblood supplies are usually\nrequired for more immediate causes such as medical\nemergencies and surgery.\nEwe look familiar\nR\nesearchers at the\nUniversity of\nCambridge have\ndemonstrated\nthat sheep have face\nrecognition abilities, comparable to those of humans\nand non-human primates.\nEight sheep were\ntrained to recognise\nthe faces of actors Jake\nGyllenhaal and Emma\nWatson, former US President Barack Obama, and\nBBC newsreader Fiona\nBruce. The sheep chose\nthe familiar celebrity\nimage over an unfamiliar\nface. They could also recognise the celebrity faces\nwhen they were presented\nin different perspectives,\nan ability previously only\nshown in humans.\nPrevious studies had\nshown that sheep could\nidentify other sheep and\nhuman handlers that they\nalready knew. But what\nthe study\u2019s lead author\nJenny Morton asked was\nwhether sheep could learn\nto recognise someone\nfrom a photograph.\nShe said that the team\nof researchers \u201cfocused on\nwhether or not an animal\nwas capable of processing\na two-dimensional object\nas a person\u201d.\nEight female Welsh\nMountain sheep were\nshown different photos on\ntwo computer screens. The\nsheep made their choice\nby breaking an infrared\nbeam with their noses to\nrelease a food pellet as a\ntreat. The sheep were able\nto recognise the faces of\nthe four celebrities 80% of\nthe time.\nThe next stage was to\ntest whether the sheep\ncould recognise the four\ncelebrity faces if they\nwere presented in different perspectives. This\nability has previously been\nshown only in humans.\nSheep successfully recognised the four celebrity\nfaces from tilted images.\nWhile there was a drop\nin performance with the\ntilted images to 67%, this\nis a magnitude similar to\nthat seen when humans\nperform the same task.\nFinally, the researchers\nwanted to know if the\nsheep could recognise\ntheir handlers from a\nphoto. Images of their\ncustodians were randomly\ninterspersed in a sequence\nof unfamiliar faces shown\nto them on the screens.\nThe sheep were not pre-trained to recognise their\nhandlers\u2019 face as they\nwere with the celebrity\nfaces, but the sheep were\nstill successful, identifying their handlers 72% of\nthe time.\nAll good for the sheep,\nbut why is this research\nuseful to us? Researchers\nsay it could help investigate cognitive dysfunction\nin humans.\nMany diseases, such\nas Huntington\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, impair face per-ception, as do some psychiatric disorders such as\nautism spectrum disorder\nand schizophrenia.\nHuntington\u2019s disease\nhas been modelled in\nsheep, but higher order\nbehavioural and cognitive\nprocesses, such as face\nrecognition, have not\nbeen tested in sheep with\nHuntington\u2019s disease. The\nsame face recognition\nexperiment could be\nrepeated on sheep with\nHuntington\u2019s to study the\ncognitive decline associated with the disease.\nSCIENCE\nMeesha Patel\nScience Writer\nSCIENCE\nHenry Bennie\nScience Editor\nBlood could provide an answer to disease in the future // Creative Commons\nSheep can recognise\ncelebrities including\nBaa-rack O-baa-ma.\nNothing but respect for my President // University of Cambridge\nNew trials aiming\nto treat Alzheimer\u2019s\npatients using blood\ntransfusions\n\u201cThe authors\nremain hopeful\nthat these\nfindings show\nsignificance\u201d\ncomparison to the control\ngroup there was even an\nimprovement in functional\nability, although mood and\nglobal cognition weren\u2019t\naffected.\nThe authors for this\n\n"

These companies are\ncentred around geographical locations where tax can\nbe more easily avoided,\nsuch as British Crown Dependencies, US states like\nDelaware, and small countries such as Mauritias or\nPanama. Firms work out\nof these locations as they\neither provide very low\ntax opportunities, such\nas the Isle of Man, where\ninheritance tax does not\nexist, or allow for the\neasy creation of shell\ncompanies, which make\nthe accounting process\nmore opaque and help to\nconceal the true extent of\nhow much an individual\nor company owns. It also\nallows for the provision\nof a certain amount of\nanonymity by allowing\nthe individual or company\nto disassociate themselves\nfrom their wealth whilst\nstill benefitting from it.\nThis is a huge issue for\nevery single individual\nthat does not benefit from\nthese schemes.\nThe nations and dependencies that tax havens\nare set up in rely upon the\nvery wealthy depositing\ntheir funds with them\nand then profiting from\nthe legal, managerial, and\naccounting fees. They\ncannot envisage another\nway of doing business\nthat would provide them\nwith a similar GDP and\nstandard of living for their\nresidents. One investigative journalist, Nicholas\nShaxson, describes these\nlocations as \u201ccaptured\nstates,\u201d in which private\ninterest forms the basis of\npublic policy. The British\nCrown Dependencies have\nbecome important tax\nhavens due to their lack\nof financial solvency. This\nlack of a second option for\nmany of these tax havens\nensures their presence in\nthe world for a long time\nto come.\nThe very rich paying\nlittle to no tax is not a new\nphenomenon. Individuals\nwith the majority of the\nwealth have often possessed an undue amount\nof influence with the body\nthat sets the tax. In today\u2019s\nworld the relationship\nbetween the very wealthy\nand the political bodies\nthat set the tax is very\ntight \u2013 often being the\nsame people \u2013 but public\nscrutiny and influence\nlimits the amount of\nacceptable cronyism,\nhence the existence of\ntax havens. The estimates\nfor how much money is\noffshore vary wildly, from\naround $7 trillion up to\n$36 trillion, but no one\nreally knows for certain.\nFor comparison US GDP\nis estimated at $18.57\ntrillion. Of the money\nconcealed offshore, it has\nbeen proposed that 0.01%\nof the world\u2019s wealthiest\nown 50%, with 0.1%\nowning 80%. This demonstrates the tiny number of\nindividuals using these\ntax havens and begins to\nreveal the extent to which\ntax havens contribute to\ninequality.\nIn an attempt to ethically justify their existence,\nthe companies that run\nthese offshore schemes\nhave posited that they\nare necessary to prevent\ngovernment over-taxation.\nGiven that these schemes\nare exclusively for the very\nwealthy, I would dispute\nthis, as it does not so much\nprevent over-taxation as\nprovide an option for individuals and companies to\navoid their obligations to\nthe societies in which they\noperate. The net result of\navoiding their obligations\nis an overall reduction in\nthe funds available to pay\nfor public services and\ntherefore a requirement\nto increased taxation of\nthose who cannot avoid\ntax: the poorer members\nof society.\nOffshore finance\nfound that hundreds of\nmillions of pounds worth\nof property was used\nby offshore companies\nto launder money for\ncriminals and corrupt of-ficials. In a market where\nhundreds of millions is an\ninsignificant amount there\nis undoubtedly far more\nwealth hiding from the\ngaze of officials.\nA further effect of tax\nhavens is to force other\nnation states to lower\ntheir taxes in an attempt\nto obtain some revenue\nfrom wealthy people.\nIreland is an example of\none such nation taking\nthese measures, but it was\nforced to pay $15 billion\nin back taxes for providing\nApple with illegal state\naid. This has provoked\ncontroversy in the US, as\nit believes that these back\ntaxes should be paid there\nand not to the EU.\nThis raises the ultimate\nquestion: how to reduce\nthe use of tax havens?\nAlthough various nations\naround the world now\ntrack the amount of wealth\nhidden offshore there has\nbeen no serious attempt by\nthe UK or any other major\nplayers to increase the\namount of regulation. A\nproposed solution would\nbe to track all wealth and\nassets around the world,\nbut the level of transparency required for this is\nlikely unattainable. The\nonly main intervention on\nthe behalf of transparency\ncomes from these irregular\nleaks. Offshore is a thorny\nproblem, and one that will\nnot disappear as long as\nwealthy individuals do not\nfulfil their obligations to\nsociety.\nThe net result of\noffshore has been a contribution to the ever-increas-ing inequality between the\nrich and poor. If they don\u2019t\npay, we will have to.\n\u201cSiri, find me a creative commons photo of money\u201d// Flickr\n\u201cEstimates\nfor offshore\nwealth vary,\nfrom $7 trillion\nto $36 trillion,\nbut no one\nreally knows\u201d\nfurther damages states\nby allowing criminals\nand corrupt officials to\neasily hide their ill-gotten\ngains in shell companies,\nwhich provide complete\nanonymity A Met Police\ninvestigation in 2015\n\n"
