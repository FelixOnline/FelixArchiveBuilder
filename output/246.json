    "content": "This was not actually the sailing club on an Easter cruise, nearer the\nGoon Show on safari. The cruise was better nl an ned, and eau ally enjoyable.\nCRUISING\nALONG Over the Easter vacation, about 37\npeople put out to sea in various small\nboats under the auspices of the Deep\nSea Section of the Sailing Club. This\nsection has recently expanded rapidly,\nseven boats being charter ecr^ this\ntime from Lymington, Salcombe and\nMaldon in Essex, the cruises covering a total distance of nearly .3000\nmiles.\nFLAG PLANTED\nAmong other things, the Torrey\nCanyon was visited, the Scilly Isles\ncircumnavigated and the French\ncanals and rivers sailed upon. The\nImperial College flag was planted on\nmost of the Channel Isles, and the\nSouth and East coasts, of England\nwere thoroughly explored. One boat\ndefied nature by beating into a force\n8 gale, whilst the crews of the two\nEast Coast h pats witnessed, another\nyacht blow up and sink at close quarters, fortunately no one being injured\nCHARTER FEES\nThe main object of the section is\nto give members experience of deep-saa sailing, navigation and seaman-ship. The only difficulty is one of\nmoney\u2014the charter fees are all paid\nput of members' pockets. The Union\nhas gone someway towards alleviating\nthis by generously providing money\nfor safety equipment and charts, but\nthe ultimate goal must still remain\na boat of our own with which to win\nocean races.\nDOING ANYTHING THIS\nVAC?\nAEGENA CLUB\norganises student travel, villa\nparties, tours and cruises in\nGREECE TURKEY\nCYPRUS\nDetails from: 25 Hills Road,\nTel. 63256 Cambridge\nEASTER HOCKEY TOUR On Friday, March 24th, fifteen\nmembers of the club left England by\nthe night boat from Harwich to the\nHook of Holland. Arriving W'6.30 a.m., we took a train to Amsterdam\nand thence to Alkmaar, about 30 kilometres away. We remained there for\nthree days and took part in an international festival. The games were\nplayed on Sunday and Monday. On\nSunday, I.C. played against Lyons\nUniversity, an Alkmaar side and a side from the Hoek, H.D. M. Drawing the first game against Lyons, I.C. went on to win the next two games\nand this half of the draw. The final\nwas . played on Monday against\n\" Clipper \"Hamburg, a side containing three internationals. This game\nwas played in very wet conditions and\nI.C. held their own, but for one total\nbreakthrough of which Clipper took\nfull advantage. We thus lost 1\u20142\nand came second in the festival.\nWhile in Alkmaar, the sides stayed\nwith members of the home club and\nwere showered with an embarrassing\namount of hospitality. No one was\nallowed a second's boredom.\nGRONONGEN\nOn Monday evening, we left with\nour hosts for, the next three days,\nForward, the Gronongen University\nside, who had also been at the fest i val. Unfortunately, due to the rain,\noutdoor hockey was out of the ques-tion, so Forward took us sailing,\nsightseeing, wined and dined us in\ngreat style and arranged some indo dr hockey. We took to this game very\nquickly and in a friendly tournament\ndid not disgrace ourselves, nor that\nevening did we disgrace our hosts\nwhen they provided us with a limitless supply of liquor.\nHOMEWARDS\nOn Friday, 31st March, we returned\nto Amsterdam where we visited the\nHeineken Brewery and did some\nsightseeing. The night was spent in\na hotel recommended to us by Forward and we left Holland the ne x\\ day with many very pleasant memo-ries.\nU.L. CHAMPS\nI.C. take Womens Athletics Cup\nThis year'sU.L. Championships,\nJd last Friday and Saturday, pro-iced some twenty contested events.\nThere were some outstanding results,\nand I.C. ended with three cups in its\npossession\u2014two individual and one\nteam. The latter\u2014the Sherwood\nChallenge Cup for Women \u2014 is\nawarded on a factor basis. Thus the\npoints scored are multiplied by a factor, based on the number of\nwomen in each college\u2014so I.C. had\na generous allowance. However, this\nin no way detracts from the meritorious achievement, particularly as\nour points were scored by only two\ncompetitors. Ann Burrell, who retained her high jump title, gained the\n80m. hurdles and was second in the\nlong jump-y and Margaret Lumley\nwas second in the hurdles.\nBARTON WINS\nIn the competition for the remaining three cups, I.C. were un placed in\nthe \"Men's Factor Cup,\" were third\nin the \" Roseberry Men's Cup,\" only\na few points behind U.C., but some\nway behind Guy's Hospital (last\nyear's winners), and were third in the\n\" Imperial College Women's Cup,\"\nbehind Royal Free Hospital and\nRoyal Holloway College.\nIndividual cups were won by Nick\nBarton, in the 880, and Mike Evans,\nin the high jump. N. Barton recovered well, from being boxed in at\nthe start, to take the lead during the\nfirst lap, and hung on to win in 1 min.\n58.5 sec. This was slightly slower\nthan his last time, and by no means\nas easy a race. As expected M. Evans\nmain rival was team-mate Mole\nWeaver, and a close competition re-sul ted. Both cleared 5 ft. 10 in., and\nfailing at 6ft \u2014M. Evans won with\nfewer failures.\nCONVINCING WIN\nFOR BECK\nFrom I.C.'s point of view, the performance most worthy of a cup was\nby Richard Beck, in the 440. How*\never, there is no cup for this event.\nR. Beck won convincingly, beating\n:hampi on I. Morgan (Guys), and\nachieved a personal best of 49.4, just\n0.3 sees, outside the College record.\nThis was after running two fast 220s \u2014finishing second in the final.\nAnother College athlete who\nachieved a personal best was Paul\nJones, who increased his best triple\njump to 45 ft. 1 in.\u2014this with a below\nfull offered attempt, to end a sequence\nof no jumps. However, John Myers\n(St. Mary's) won with a jump of\n48 ft. lin.\u2014this beating the University record, held by ex-I.C. jumper D. Smith. Former Cambridge athlete,\nDwamoa Adu, now of U.C.H. was\nsecond on 46 ft. 9in. LONG JUMP\nIn the long jump, a disappointed\nDerek Wade managed only 21 ,ft.\nHi in. and had to concede victory\nto his Belgrave Harriers club mate John Mitchell (Royal Free Hospital).\nThe latter also found time between\njumps to win the 100 yd s., but, due to\na blustery headwind, his time was\nonly 10.4 sees. I.C. produced three\nof the placed runners in the steeple-chase. Howard Smith finished 3rd, and Tony Mason, running his first\nsteeplechase, finished 5th. Dave\nDownie cleared only 9 ft. 6 in. in\nthe pole vault\u2014a foot below his best\nwinter jump\u2014and finished4 th. With\ntraining his form should begin to re-turn.\nSUCCESS\nUnexpected points were gained in\nthe 120 yd s. hurdles, where College\nchampions (Ten Weh Sam), after\nleading all the way, lost to Domaigne\n(Guys) in the finishing straight. Neil\nJohnson (I.C:) ended in fifth place.\nAs expected, the College results in the\nfield events were poor\u2014there was only\none thrower competing. With more\ncompetitions in this sphere, I.C. might\nwell have won the championships.\nThis was one of I.C.'s more successful championships, and as a result I.C. should now be providing a proportion of the U.L. team. Consequently\nthe college team, for this term's matches, will be somewhat reduced in\nstrength. Thus new members will be\nneeded \u2014\u2022 anyone interested should\ncontact the club and watch the notice\nboard.\nI.R.

    "content": "2 FELIX\nHas Muggeridge had\nenough ?\nThe latest obsession with Malcolm Muggeridge seems to be\nChristianity. This was the chief\npoint emerging from his very\ninteresting General Studies lectures on the last day of the last\nterm.\nBeginning his talk after a very loud\nround of applause, Mr. Muggeridge\nstarted off by talking about his\n\" medium \"\u2014the \" telly \" as he called\nit\u2014which, as he later admitted, he\nfrequents so often to bolster his ego.\nBut some points made by him were\nperhaps frightening, and certainly most\npertinent, to the subject in question.\nHe began by citing \" Wagon Train \"\nand \" Peyton Place \" as examples of\nthe Western world's chief exports to\nthe developing countries. This he\nthought symbolised the failure of\nWestern civilisation and technology.\nHe claimed, I think correctly, that\nour knowledge of ourselves has remained almost stagnant while technology has overtaken us\u2014one only has\nto go to Montreal's Expo. '67 to\nrealise this. His view seemed to\nimply that the growth of advanced\ntechnological methods and products(\nall material goods, somehow hamper,\nor have hampered till now, the parallel growth of spiritual humanitarian\nknowledge and that it leads to the\nsuffocation and stagnation of culture.\nMr. Muggeridge's fears stem in the\nmain from his basic belief that something has gone wrong with western\ncivilisation and that it will continue\nto decline. He asserted' that the main\nfault in the Utopia as imagined by\nour forebears\u2014and almost accomplished by the Scandinavian countries\n\u2014was the basic assumption that the\ngratification of the need for material\ngoods and sensual pleasure is the prerequisite to human happiness. His\nanswer to everything lay in a\" return \" to Christianity as the guiding\nlight of people's lives.\nMr. i Mug ge ridge now seems to be\npreaching complete puritanism: the\nrestraint of bodily desires as the path\nto \" happiness.\" This he calls Christianity. In view of his derision of the\n\" establishment\" Christian Church,\nand despite his qualifying statement,\n\" I say Christianity, being a Western\nEuropean,\" I would still attack him\non being narrow-minded, especially\nsince this comes from a person as\ncosmopolitan as he. The principles\nhe holds form the basis of\nmost religions \u2014 certainly Hinduism\nand Buddhism\u2014and the keystone of\nYoga : in short a\" Mind over Matter.\" So what new has Mr. Muggeridge to offer 7\nR.

Nobody\nexcept the lecturer in charge knows\nwho he is. He comes to lectures completely covered by a black bag except\nfor a pair of bare feet sticking out of\nthe bottom. In conversations with\nstudents and newspaper reporters he\nsays he is doing it as a philosophical\nexperiment.\"\nMICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, after two students\nwere disciplined for kissing each other\nan campus, 600 students took part in\na mass kiss-in.\"\nAt FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY an 18-year-old girl\nstudent was disciplined for posing\nnude for photos in a university\nadministrative building. A banner\nwas seen saying \" nude power.\"\nAt FORDHAM UNIVERSITY (N.Y.) an experiment in\nteaching is to be carried out in the\nnewly-formed Bensalem College.\nThere will be 30 students and staff in\nthe college. No formal classes or\nexams are planned. Students and\nstaff will plan the syllabus together\nand will be free to go on foreign ex-changes, civil right and peace corps\nwork. The only entrance qualification is to have a working knowledge\nof URDU, of all things. \" We hope\nto make life so interesting that students won't need LSD,\" said the or-gan is er. At PRINCETON UNIVERSITY a survey of 150 undergraduates by a student group indicates\nthat up to 15 per cent of Princeton's3,500 students may use mild drugs\nsuch as Marijuana, LSD and Hashish.\nNo evidence of \" hard \" drug taking\n(heroin, cocaine, etc.) was found.\nAtom Power\nis cheaper\nsays Penney\nHe then gave a brief outline of the\nuse of the moderator to transfer neutron energy to thermal energy, and the\neffect of increasing fission s probability by slowing the neutrons. Next\nhe described the principles of several\ntypes of reactor as developed by the\nU.K. A. E.A. He started with the\nBoiling Water Reactor and its low\nefficiency of about 30 per cent, and\nincluded a mention of the methods of\ncontrolling the speed of reaction. He\nthen went on to describe the press uri sed water reactor, with about the\nsame efficiency, and the gas-cooled\nreactor, with an efficiency of up to\n43 per cent. He explained that one\nlarge cause of the low efficiencies with\ngas-cooled reactors was the use of\nheat exchanger s and steam turbo-alternators. He predicted that this\nwould give way to gas turbines delivering up to a hundred megawatts.\nHe finished this section of his talk\nwith an outline of the fast reactor at\nDounreay, with its double heat exchanging system using 1000 tons of\nliquid sodium, and its ability to breed\nfuel at a greater rate than it uses it.\nSex\nchange\nin IC\nExec.\nThose of us who, having nothing\nbetter to do di/ring Tuesday lunch-time, read SENNET, will, no doubt,\nhave noticed some controversy recently over I.C.'s men-only bar.\nIn last week's issue, our beloved\npresident defended this practice of\nsegregation ; thus one would assume\nthat in this, a year of strong presidency, former traditions\u2014especially\nthis one\u2014would be upheld.\nThis being the case, it is the unpleasant duty of FELIX to reveal to\nits readers a sad increase in the sex-ratio at IC.\nLast Sunday evening, any self-re-spec ting member of the Union, in\nentering this male preserve, would\nhave been shocked to observe that\nthree former members of ICWA (in-clu ding their president Ann Hay)\nsupping in the bar. Since Howard\nmade no attempt to remove these\nthree one can only assume that he was\n\" in the know\" concerning this sad\nbiological state of -affairs. Djai\nHowell, strange to relate, seemed unperturbed by the affair.\nHowever one shudders to think of\nthe consequences if the change had\noccurred after the Carnival Queen\nelections\u2014that is, if Ann Hay had\nbeen elected.\nNone of these ex-Icwarians has yet\ndisclosed which Sunday newspaper\ngets their story.\nThe other section was a brief talk\non the economics, where Sir William\nsaid that cost considerations are far\nmore involved than is usually realised\nin such effects as production costs for\nvery large structures, methods of\ntransportation of such structures and\nthe safety standards imposed. He\nclaimed that nuclear power stations\nnow provide electricity at a cost 25\nper cent cheaper than coal-fired\nstations.\nHe pointed out that these stations\nare economically affected by commer-cia l, political, and scale considerations. During coffee after the lecture, Sir\nWilliam exposed the apparent greater\nefficiency of the Tennessee valley\nstations as a mathematical trick on the\npart of the Americans, which makes\nabout 70 per cent, difference in the\ncost of electricity.\nThe lecture, which was attended by\nabout one hundred people, was illustrated by a set of slides, showing\nBritish nuclear power stations.\nR. BASS.\n\" It is possible to prove anything,\" said Sir William Penney, the\nnew Rector of Imperial College, on, the economics of nuclear technology at the Wells Society on Monday, 1st May.\nSir William started his lecture by running over the basic fission\nprocess used in all nuclear reactors, and! the processes necessary in\norder to get enriched fuel.\n\n"

The article and facts had' been. edited to misrepresent the total story. What' s the point of allowing a\" FELIX reporter into the May Ball if he isn't going to report it? The May. Ball did not stumble from mishap to mishap due to c ii a a tic organisation as the article infers,'. There were two mishaps, neither having anything to dp With the Ents Committee. The money was my own responsibility, and the onus forgiving free tickets to Carnival Queen finalists lies with the President. Chapman( myself) spent three hours imagining about the\" fate of.. his girlfriend\". When the cash was finally necessary; I took. a taxi to her home on hearing how si clc she had been. This year's May Ball was regarded by most people as being the most entertaining and trouble free for several jr ears. This was due mainly to Ents Committee anticipating the problems and averting on the night those that could not before seen, i.e. arranging another band^ at thirty minutes notice, to play in place of one who had not turned up, persuading a group to play the contracted time. I consider the article grossly unfair to the Ents Committee. R.S. Chapman( Chairman... of Ents) Editor( PELI X):; Apart from the loss of money, for which Mr. Chapman has himself... accepted responsibility, no blame was apportioned in the article concerned to anyone, let alone the Entertainments Committee, for the mishaps that occurred at the Ball,( Further letters held over to next issue) Union Meeting In cuo rate C.I.A..

When, at about1.20 when only100 people had turned up, Tony Duke. suggested that a motion that I.C.U, should apply for a grant from the C.I.A. should be discussed as a debate, the meeting agreed. The motion, which was originated by PeteR u he man, was lighthearted and was meant to. reduce political tension in the Union. The motion was proposed by Mike Edwards and opposed by Pave Reich. The debate was most amusing( Debate es please take note) Proposing the motion. Mike Edwards suggested that, since the Union was in financial difficulties, the C.I.A. was a good source of money as it tied few strings to it,, unlike the X.3.B.

At the Customs certain members of the group had to pay\nimport duty on their breath alone.\nAfter a couple of hours sleep the\nfive healthiest members were dragged\nout of bed by Fagins to play against\nGuinness Brewery. The rest of the\nteam could only summon the strength\nto locate the bar. While Rayner and\nO 'Reilly had been dragged out by\n\" Boo-Boo\" Smith to locate Trinity\nCollege to arrange Tuesday's game it\nwas at 6.30 a.m. the following morning that Guinness scored a tech ni cal(?) knock-out over Smith in the\n21st round, Trinity having been forgotten long ago.\n9-8 WIN\nSunday saw the visit to Navan\nRugby Club for the first game of the\ntour. After travelling through a snowstorm en route the players found a pitch in similar condition to them-selves. However, with Pine in his\nusual sparkling form, the tough\nNavan forwards were gradually overcome by a recovering I.C. team. Despite a gale force wind the ball was\nthrown around with gay abandon and\nI.C. eventually ran out worthy winners by 9\u20148, thanks to tries by\n\" Doddy,\" Riley and Bell.\nAt the dance that evening Powell\nand Vickerstaff indulged in a highland fling that had Robbie Burns\nturning in his grave.\nFAST T.C.D On Monday the team travelled to\nTrinity College to face a big, fast experienced Trinity XV. The events of\nthe previous night solved the problem of team selection and it was 15\napprehensive black and blue jerseys\nthat took the field. However, last\nnight was soon forgotten and I.C. opened with some of their finest\nRugby of the season, treating the\nlarge number of spectators to a feast\nof open Rugby. However keen\nT.C.D. tackling prevented a rout,\nand I.C. were unlucky only to have 11\npoints on the board at half-time, due\nto Bell, a hard-working forward,\nDodson and Earl, none of which were\nconverted thanks to some inglorious\nshots at goal. Unfortunately halftime brought snow, hail and anything\nelse the heavens could offer. The\ngame then closed up some and after\nVickerstaff had put one of the T.C.D. second rows to sleep, some time\nbefore his usual bedtime, the game\nwarmed up to offset the effects of the\nsnow. However Irish tempers proved\nnothing to match the soothing effect\nof the I.C. pack and order was soon\nrestored. Doddy then went on to\nscore another fine try which Riley\nconverted with a magnificent kick\nfrom under the posts.\nRECORD BROKEN ?\nTuesday was the I.C. Sabbath and\nthe day was spent trying to break the\nGuuinness drinking record. As the\nrecorder was the first to fall the\nrecord was only broken unofficially.\nIn the evening Williams, suitably\naided by Kelly, entertained the Limelight Club to the green green grass of\nhome and many other Welsh ditties.\nShe was closely followed by that\nmerry plough boy John Lum with a selection of Irish ballads, though the\nIrish didn't seem to recognise them\nas such.\nU.C.D. BEATEN\nThe final game against U.C.D. was\nnearly a tragedy due to their turning\nout a young, fit, extremely keen side.\nHowever the old old hands in the I.C. front row \u2014 Casson, Powell and\nO 'Reilly\u2014soon subdued the fiery Irish\nforwards with their experience and\nwith Lum dominating the line-outs,\nI.C. managed to provide ample ball\nfor the three-quarters. John Earl\ndropped two beautiful goals and\nJohn Kelly, showing all his early fire\nand determination went over for a magnificent try. Time after time I.C. were saved , by Pine whose defence\nwas as secure as the Rock of Gibraltar and I.C. eventually ran out worthy\nvictors by 9 points against 3.\nOn the whole a grand tour was enjoyed by the College and the behaviour and spirit, both on and off\nthe field, left behind with the Irish a very favourable impression of I.C. MEMBERS ONLY\nThere are some people who have\nnot handed in their Rugby Shirts or\nDinner Money. These must be in by\nNEXT MONDAY AT.THE LATEST\nPlease give either to J.O 'Reilly or\nleave at the Cloakroom.\nTo get the most\ninto the least\nR. CS. MOTOR CLUB NEED A MINI\nR.C.S.

Everything suddenly, frighteningly ^pensive. Ends\nhardly ever seeming to meet. The Westmiast r can help\nyou, as it helps thousands of young people cve iy ear.\n1. As you get into your stride. You'll soon have money\ndecisions to make (types of insurance, mortgage problems,\nand so on). Your local Westminster Manager has immense\nexperience of such problems. Let him help you draw up a personal budget that will give you a chance to build up a small reserve of capital.\n2. The price of success. The more successful you are, the\nmore expenses you will have. And the more you'll need\nto keep track of where your money's going. Clothes,\nentertainment, foreign travel, children's education. The\nWestminster gives you a precise record of how you spend\nyour money and will pay all your regular bills by ' standing\norder'.\n3. When you reach the top. Sooner or later you'll have to\ninvest quite substantial sums of personal capital. The quality\nof your life after retirement depends on how you do it. The\nbest advice comes from someone who knows you. That's when you're doubly glad you joined the Westminster early,\nand built up a good relationship with your Manager.\n4. A word about your Manager. His instinct is not to\nwarn, but to help. Call in on your local Westminster\nManager\u2014you'll see what an up-to-date bank can do. And\nyou'll probably find he is prepared to reduce the cost of your\nbank charges in the early years of your career.\nHave a talk this week with your local Westminster\nManager. Ask how he can help you in your career. The\nWestminster has over 1,380 branches in England and\nWales. Head Office: 41 Lothbury, London, EC2.\n\n"

Beginning his career as an instrument repairman in the RAF, he didn't discover electrical engineering\nuntil he was 21. Since then, he has never looked back. He is now\nwell known for his work on the linear induction motor and his \" Propulsion Without Wheels.\" He is married with four children.\nPROF ESS OR LAI THWAITE One hears a lot in this country\nabout ideas which die at the experimental stage without being\ndeveloped commercially. Do\nyou consider this a serious problem ? If so, what is being done\nabout it ?\nThis is quite a serious problem.\nHowever, quite a lot is being done\nabout it, particularly by Lord Jackson who is pushing for greater cooperation between university departments and industry. It doesn't affect\nme personally, because I seem to be\ngetting my ideas developed by indus-try.\nDo you think that money for\ndevelopment is more readily\navailable in America ? Have you\nbeen tempted to go there ?\nYes, it is. And I have had offers\nto go to America. But I have never\nbeen tempted to go. I am very English, I suppose.\nYou have described the job of\nengineering as the economic exploitation of observed phe no mena, the main objectives of the\nengineer being to make money.\nWhat, then, does an engineer do\nin a university besides teaching ?\nWell, my kind of engineer spends\nhis time inventing. An engineer actually is not so much concerned with\ntruths as he is with concepts. He\ntries to devise new concepts and to\nselect from them those which are profitable\u2014both for himself, and for his\ncompany. I am Very interested in en-Gregarious\nGraduates\nand other young professional\npeople all join the\nSAMOVAR CLUB\nWine and Music evenings,\ntoffee parties, swimming talks,\ntennis, etc. S. a&, Samovar\nClub. 13 Lloyd Square, WJC4\ng in ee ring in industry, and assist by\nconsulting for several organisations.\nWho would own the development rights on a device of some\nsort discovered or invented by a professor at a university in the\ncourse of his work ?\nLet me answer this by saying what\nhappens in a case in point. At the\nmoment I happen to have a couple of\npatent able ideas. The National Research and Development Corporation\nwill finance the patent, which is taken\nout by three parties : the inventor,\nthe college, and the Corporation. The\nN.R. D.C. will then try to exploit the\nidea commercially. There is a revenue sharing agreement between\nthe college and the N.R. D.C., and the\ncollege decides what the inventor's share will be. An engineer is actually better off financially as an academic than he would be in industry for\nthis reason. In industry his ideas\nwould belong solely to his company.\nWhat qualities do you think\nmake a good engineer ?\nPrimarily an awareness of three\ndimensions, an intuitive consciousness\nof three-dimension ed objects, and the\nability to correlate the feel and sight\nof objects. Some of this is inborn,\nand some acquired early in life. A good engineer may be made or\nbroken as a small child depending on\nwhether he acquires this feel for solid\nobjects or not. He must also be\nsound in logical argument of the sort\nused in mathematics, although he\nneed n't be a good mathematician.\nBut most of all he must have enthusiasm for his subject and the will to\nMind over matter ?

    "content": "1\nFELIX\nUtUw to FELIX\nThe meaning of a University Education\nSir,\nIn the present issue of \" Phoenix,''\nMr. Mike Edwards, in an article on\nthe responsibilities of a Student\nUnion, suggests that the prime function of such a body should be to\npartner the staff of the University in\nthe planning and execution of academic teaching. This view if implemented would, it seems to me, soon\ndestroy a large part of what is to be\ngained from a University education\nand reduce a university to a machine\nfor mass producing academic knowledge implanted in human brains (a \u2022description often applied to technical\ncolleges and colleges of advanced\ntechnology in this country).\nA university has always had a corporate identity and character in\nwhich teaching function plays only a part; even with to-day's emphasis on\nthe importance of teaching the undergraduate session occupies little more\nthan half the year. A university\ncharacter stems from the personalities\nand experiences of generations of its\nacademic and administrative staff and\nfrom their original work. Experience of a university atmosphere is ava lua ole par i ot education and students should not expect to be able to\nchange it to suit them during their\nbrief undergraduate stay. The recent\nfur ore at the L.S.E. over the appointment of a new Principal was quite\nunjustified.\nThough the Students' Union has a valuable part to play in academic\nliaison with the staff (i.e. in the academic s uh committees existing in several\ndepartments at I.C.), its main function\nshould be to create \" potential leaders\nin society,\" as suggested by Mr.\nEdwards, provided the opportunity\nfor experience outside academic work,\nand interaction with other students.\nOwing to its limited range of academic studies, I.C. is particularly vulnerable to those who would make it\na mere teaching machine. Let us\nhope that our Union will continue to\npay sufficient attention to the other\nhalf of our education.\nYours faithfully,\nPaul V. Briscoe\nSchool of the Architectural Association\nA PLACE IN I.C? The Architectural Association shares, with Oxford and Cambridge, a unique beginning. All three were initiated by discontented\nyoung men striving to teach themselves a discipline. They themselves\nfounded the A. A. in 1847 to hire and hear lecturers^ to discuss papers\nand to hold design classes. From this small but spirited beginning, the\nA. A. has grown into an institution embracing over three thousand\npractising architects and containing a school of international reputation. Tne School has strong links,\nthrough its membership and through\nteaching, with tropical centres. Led\nby its students between the wars it\nhelped to pioneer modern architecture\nand the new approach to design that\nthat entailed.\nThe School has 380 students, the\n\" undergraduates\" pursuing a five\nyear course. Their education is divided\nbetween studio design projects and\nlecture courses involving the fabric\nof buildings, communications and services (history of architecture, sci en to fic and economic ideas, etc.), and professional studies. Although they are\nstudents in the sense that they are\nlearn i'1' and have examinations to\npass ./ have an extraordinary\namount of power. Theirs is the role,\nnot of the glorified schoolboy with\nbook in front and university rod be-hind, but of partner in the educational system. Student and lecturer\nshare responsibility. The students can\nrid themselves of incompetent lecturers and tutors : they have an effective vote and are probationary members of the Architectural Association.\nIt is this close link with the practising\nprofessional body of architects which\nis unique and which they value\nhighly. The intimate link between\nstudent and practising architect is\nmutually stimulating, especially so\nsince their lecturers are practising\narchitects themselves.\nWhat then is the plan for the incorporation of the school in IC ? The\nSchool would become the fourth Constituent College of IC and have equal\nstatus with RSM, RCS and C&G. Graduates of the School would then\ngain University of London degrees,\nand the School would be represented\non all the relevant governing bodies\nof IC. It would have an academic\nstaff of 39 including four professors.\nHaving University status its operating\ncosts would be paid by the University\nGrants Committee.\nThe present premises of the Association and School are in Bedford\nSquare, W. C1. A site in the immediate vicinity of IC, for the construction of a new building to house the\nSchool and its parent body is being\nnegotiated at present. For the School,\nthe advantages of the am alga tion are\nimmense. It will gain University\nstatus so that the main burden of\nfinancing the School will pass from\nthe student pocket to the U.G.C. The\nteaching will benefit by contact with\nother university teachers in allied\ndisciplines. Finally the students\nthemselves will benefit by living in a University environment and meeting\na wider range of students.\nIn fact, however, it was IC who\nmade the initial approach to the A. A., proposing the amalgamation, and for\nIC, the broadening in scope of its\ncharacter, disciplines, and undergraduate body is vital. In one step\nIC will gain 400 students, different\nand refreshing in their approach, to\ntheir work and lives. IC can only\ngain by their admission.\nThe present premises of the Architectural Association in Bedford\nSquare\nPhoenix\nreviewed\nby\n* Edward Pank\nImperial College has need of a magazine like this. The idea of the\nPhoenix is right, but the present management is not developing it. There\nis a real danger of the magazine dying\nout through lack of good advertising,\nbut above all lack of the organisation\nto tap whatever writing talent that we\nhave at I.C. The high quality of the\nactual production is unfortunately belied by its contents.\nThe editorial is on an interesting\nsubject, namely our relations as students with the state and the brain-drain. This is a large and complex\nmatter, but one is left with a series\nof only half-drawn ideas and undeveloped comparisons which are rather\nunsatisfying.\nThe best article in the magazine is\nthat on the psychology of \" Westerns.\" But even here one is disappointed by seeing the earlier psychologists swallowed whole in a welter of\nJungian and Freudian an lysis. It is\ninteresting that the author saw fit to\nenrich our language by the addition\nof the word \" ir reality.\" The subject of \" Welfare and Taxation \" is given most cursory treatment\nby David Reich. This article attempts to demolish the political ideas\nof centuries with a few awkward\nstrokes. Even outrageous statements\nare little supported by argument or\nfacts.\nThe only poem of any note is \" The\nChess Match,\" but unfortunately the\nreligious theme is brought in too late\nto be effective. Would-be poets\nshould be reminded that blank verse\nis probably the most difficult form\nto use effectively.\nThe article on the history of science\nis definitely on the right lines, but is\nrather too like the prospectus for a course at I.C., and the author's good\nideas die of neglect.\nThe stories might best be described\nas unfortunate. The \" gj m mick\" is\nalways the weakest way to end a short\nstory. \" An Ordinary Mortal \" lacks\naction and is rather mundane.\n\" Harold be Thy Name \" is just the\nthing for nostalgic Dan Dare fans.\nOne would tr rnk that someone at the\nbest Tech in Lritain could do better.\nThe photograph of the old man\nopposite \" Lai\" on page 29 is the\nmost striking feature of the magazine.\nThe composition and technical\nachievement add richly to the theme.\nIt is unfortunate that those put off by\nthe over hairstyle d woman on the\ncover will not see it.\nThe magazine ends with a semi-hysterical outburst about students'\nrights and responsibilities. This article\nbelongs at a stretch in FELIX\u2014not in\na literary magazine. One cannot escape the impression that \" Phoenix \"\nwas too hastily assembled. \" Phoenix \" should play an important role\nin the life of a College of Technology ; let the literate among us step\nforward.\n\n"

Most of the audience seemed dissatisfied with this. For residents, there are planned some all day meters, but these will not be sufficient togo round. Residents will have to obtain permits to use these places. Asked if people in Hall were residents, Mr. Bannister readout the City of Westminster definition of residents.

    "content": "4 FELLX\nCEDITOR'Somme nt A FOURTH CONSTITUENT COLLEGE\nWe are a limited College at present. Academically and within\nour range we can compare our standards favourably with those of\nany other similar academic institution in the world. Financially we\nmust be one of the most affluent in Europe. And yet outside the\nlaboratory our graduates exercise little power in Britain. As Prof.\nSalam has pointed out, consult Anthony Sampson's\" Anatomy of\nBritain \" and you will find Imperial College mentioned once whereas\nOxbridge has half a chapter. This is because in the past IC has pro-duce d, technologists and scientists and in general, fewer men of note\noutside the laboratory. Now, it is the role of IC to aspire to the finest\nacademic level. This is achieved through our academic staff and\nour research students. The majority of undergraduates however never\ngo on to higher degrees. They leave to fill the gaping stomach of\nindustry, and industry and the nation require organisers, managers,\npeople with ideas but people with the thrust to push those ideas\nthrough. How many highly qualified graduates after ten years are\nactually using their disciplines directly. Very few.\nThis rote\u2014to fit graduates for management\u2014IC has also to fill.\nTo achieve the maximum in this sphere requires a broad \" university\nenvironment.\" IC must not merely be a\" super-tech,\" it must be a university too.\nThe amalgamation with the Architectural Association is a first\nand major step in this broadening. In the words of the late Rector,\nSir Patrick Linstead :\n\" Architects and engineers have much to learn from each other\nand proper collaboration between them can be of great value to the\nnation. Moreover, it can broaden the intellectual horizons of the\nindividuals concerned. . . . To share expert teaching is valuable, to\nbe thrown into social contact at the undergraduate stage is eQually if\nless obviously so.\"\nIf the amalgamation fails at this stage; either through a lack of\nfinance from the University Grants Committee, or through the dissatisfaction of the students at the Architectural Association, it will be a crucial blow not only to the Architectural Association but above all\nto Imperial College. It could well be a mortal blow to the aspirations\nof the College to become more than a \"super-tech,\" as envisaged in the\nphilosophy of our late and inspiring Rector Sir Patrick Linstead.\nWe sincerely hope that no effort is spared by the College authorities in forcing this plan to fruition.\nBANNING THE RAG MAG\nOur Rag Mag is banned for \" obscenity in the extreme \" and is\nthen sold with tacit approval under the counter. The whole idea\nof obscenity is a subjective concept and unique to our Western\nChristian philosophy. It depends on we the readers, rather than they\nthe writers, whether we see an article, photograph or film as obscene.\nAnd if we in Imperial College were an isolated community and had\na more enlightened attitude, there would be no need to ban the magazine as obscene.\nHowever, we exist in The British and supposedly Christian community and an obscene Rag Mag would lower the-name of our College. The Executive have therefore acted in the right manner in\nbanning the Mag.\nIf they had not banned the Rag Mag for obscenity, they would\nhave done as well to ban it for the sheer incompetent production it\nis. It is an abs y mal, humour less and puerile effort at a comic maga-zine* and we could not afford to have such a pathetic and unsophisticated rag j bearing the name of our College, in circulation.\nIt is as well too, that Carnival has recouped some of its losses on\nthe magazine by selling it under the counter to internal students only.\nIf they wish to waste 5/- or 7/6 in the purchase of such drivel, they\nare welcome to.\nBut how did the whole situation of the banned Rag Mag arise\nin the first place ? Why was its production not organised and\nwatched continually by the Executive ? This is incompetent. It\nwill probably cost Carnival approximately \u00a3300, when loss of revenue\nfrom the magazine is considered. The Executive complain that additional and more obscene material was added after they had read and\ncensored the proofs. According to the printers this is not true, and\nin any case it is no excuse. Carnival would have a greater financial\nsuccess with a less casual approach by people who have contracted\nto do the job.\nSYNDICALISM\nA world student\nmovement\nby FRED GAULT\nIn some parts of the world\nStudent Activism is a rule of life\nrather than a shocking exception,\nIn the Canadian Province of\nQuebec, for example, the Student\nSyndicalist Movement has long\nbeen a popular one on French\ncampuses and fashionable, during\nperiods of national en tnt e, among\nperiods of national entente,\namong the English.\nThe Syndicalist see himself as the\nmember of a trade union movement\nrather than the carefree youth revelling in the college \" experience.\" A student, he feels, is a\" young intellectual worker,\" whose task it is to\nlearn, and thereby make himself a more productive member of society.\nIf you acknowledge that increasing t your productivity potential is\nitself a productive occupation, then\nthe student may be considered a worker little different from a farmer\nor a plumber. And, is it not discriminatory to deny a person engaged\nin a socially useful occupation the\nrights of other workers ; the right to\norganise and to engage in collective\nbargaining for grants, or, if you pre-fer, salaries ?\nThe concept of salary rather than a grant carries with it the advantage\nthat the students is no longer kept or\ntolerated by the society he lives in but\nis actually serving it. As an integral\npart of society, and as an intellectual\nworker, it is his duty to examine his\nsociety and its government and to\nspeak out loudly when he see social\ninjustice. As a member of a trade\nunion movement he is naturally\naligned with the people. His production will ultimately benefit.\nOver the past year in Quebec the\nsyndicalist Union des Etudiants\nGenerate de Quebec has held at least\none major show of solidarity with\nthe Quebec labour movement when\nhundreds of intellectual workers\npoured out of the universities to swell\nFRED GAULT\nis a Canadian now working\ntowards the D.I.C exam in theoretical physics.

G.G. would\nalso provide the initial capital for the\nsite\u2014on the IC \" campus \"\u2022\u2014and the\nconstruction of a building to house\nthe school. The sum required, is estimated at \u00a3670,000.

However, the implementation of the proposals has\nalready dropped behind schedule\u2014for\nto quote from a paper setting out the\nproposals at that time\u2014\n\" It is hoped that the proposals set\nout in this paper might be progressively implemented so that they would\nbe fully operative at the beginning of\nthe 1967-72 quin que n niu m.\" It is vital to the Architectural Association that a positive decision from\nthe U.G.C. be obtained within the\nnext six months.

In fact this\nproves to be so difficult, in some\ncases, that they do not find time\nfor any work and they do not\neven bother to take their exams\nat all. But not to worry, they\nrest safe in the knowledge that\nthey can plead severe mental\nstrain, and then the college can\narrange for them to repeat the\nyear with a renewed grant. This\nis becoming particularly common\nin certain departments of RCS\nand whilst there are, no doubt,\ngenuine cases of mental strain,\nfor many it is just the easiest way\nout. The worst feature of all is\nthat the people who run the\nUnion or take any active part in\nUnion activities are usually so\noverworked that their academic\nwork suffers. Such people are\nnot likely to miss their exams,\ntaking them with a \"Death before dishonour\" spirit. This\nmeans that, in many cases they\neither fail or get a worse degree\nthan they otherwise might have\ndone and because they have taken\ntheir exams they have no chance\nto repeat, or if they do, it is\nwithout a grant. All this makes\nFree\nUniversity of\nWest Berlin\nfrom FACTOR\nThe West Berlin City Authorities\nwere made to look slightly ridiculous\nwhen students were accused of plotting to kill Hubert Humphrey, the\nU.S. Vice-President. Eleven people\nwere arrested including eight students.\nA court later ruled that the students\nshould be freed for lack of evidence.\nThe students are now being called\n' The Custard-Pie Assassins \" in West\nGermany. The \" Chemical Bombs \"\nthat the city authorities said were to\nbe used to kill the Vice-President were\nharmless smoke bombs. The students\nsaid that the smoke was to be used\nto d is organise the police while they\nplastered the Vice-President with bags\nof flour, yoghourt, cream cakes and\ncustard pies.\n1,000 students staged demonstrations\nduring the visit.\n\"RED \"PROVOS ?\nThe arrested students belong to a pro vc type organisation that has contacts with the Chinese Embassy in\nEast Berlin. Both the East Germans\nand the West Berlin authorities are\ntrying to crush them.\nWest Berlin authorities are anti-student anyway. Free University students were recently called \"the red\nlouse in_ the fur of the Berlin Bear,\"\nand the city authorities have recommended to the University Administration that any student taking part in\ndemonstrations against U.S. policy in\nVietnam should be expelled at once. \"\none wonder whether, in the less\ngenuine cases, the college isn't taking child psychology a little\ntoo far.\nThis year, thanks to the courage of people like Jerry Stockbridge and his men, the Carnival\nBoard has at last broadened its\noutlook. It has realised that the\nway to make a lot of money is\nnot by taking it from the same\nfaithful few who support most\nUnion activities, but to appeal\nmore to the general public. They\nhave also spread the work more\nevenly over the three constituent\ncolleges, and at last the Carnival\nlooks like making a substantial\nprofit. The Folk concert in the\nAlbert Hall is a step in the right\ndirection, and perhaps next year\nthe more useless functions like\nthe garden fe te will be dropped.\nThe efforts of this year's committee are self-evident. There is a spate of little green posters radiating out from the college in all\ndirections; not even Harrods'\nwindows are inviolate, and nor\nit seems were the twenty or so\nstudents who had their names\ntaken by the 'bu les. But still the\nfact remains that the majority\nof students in this college, especially the P.G. s, do not support\ncarnival at all, and most of the\nwork is done by the same faithful\nfew.\nThe owners of the following cards\neach won a share in the Carnival\nTreble prize-money over Easter :\nNos. 662, 873, win \u00a37 10s. each.\nNos. 1932, 1059, 1101 win \u00a32 10s. each.\nNos. 615, 711, 715, 761, win\n\u00a31 17s.6d. each.\nNos. 46, 112, 136, 385, 510, 825,\n841 win \u00a31 Is. each.\nThe Treble, which has now finished,\nmade a profit of \u00a355 lis. 6d. Participation in the competition\u2014its first\nyear of existence\u2014was very encouraging for future years. Estimates show\nthat around 10 per cent of I.C. Undergraduates bought shares although\nIt was, no doubt, this that\ncaused the overworked people on\nthe Carnival Board to slip up\nover the production of the carnival mag. This remarkable work\nseems to have been printed wit iT its destination on the cover. It's a pity that Mr. Peter Potter\ndidn't think of the waste of Carnival funds before he inserted his\nlavatory-wall sections. It seems\nthat the original draft was carefully vetted by the Carnival\nBoard and certain sections re-moved. Instead of replacing them\nwith less \" blue\" material, the\neditor choose to replace them\nwith sections that were humorless and obscene. Presumably\nthe Carnival Board didn't have\ntime to re-check the proofs and\n\u00a3140 worth of magazines were\nprinted. Tony Duke quite rightly\nwithdrew them and ordered their\ndestruction, and that was supposedly that, but it is a well-known fact that many copies are\nstill in existence and are being\nsold for about 7/6 each. A prominent member of the Union was\nheard to remark Well, at least\nwe've recouped about \u00a350.\" I 've\nalways thought that destroyed\nmeans \"burnt\" and not \"dis-posed of in an underhand man-ner.\" If you want a copy try\n122, 362, or 612, but don't tell the\nPresident about it.\nrelatively small interest was shown\nby P.G. S.F MORRIS\n(Pool Promoter).\nC ND: Bob Orr\nelected\nAt the CND Annual General Meeting, Bob Orr was elected unopposed\nto succeed Malcolm Duckett of\nICCND.\nAfter greetings had been exchanged\nwith the Socialist Society it was decided that more joint action should\nbe promoted on issues like Vietnam.\n3\nPhoenix has been published at\nlast, despite the lack of support\nfrom most of the college. Mike\nWilson has managed to put together one of the best issues in\nrecent years. He is now faced\nwith the problem of selling it\nwhen nobody wants to help. Perhaps the President should ban it\nand then it would sell itself.\nSorry, Robb, banning FELIX\nwouldn't have the same effect,\nThe Maths department has just\nfitted new locks on its doors'as a result of the long-distance phone\ncall farce. It was supposedly from\nthis department that somebody\nspent most nights phoning Norway and running up a large bill.\nSo far the only people who have\nsuffered in any way are the Profs,\nin the department who are locking themselves out. Meanwhile\nrumours are still going around\nabout who was responsible and\nanybody who is known to have\nspent a few weeks in Norway\nseems suspect. A well-informed\nIcwarian seemed to think that she\nknew the culprit. She would not\nsay who, but merely inferred that\nit was a well-known figure in the\nUnion. The college might have\nbeen better employed trying to\nfind the culprit, rather than locking the stable doors. . . .\nP.S.^I haven't thought of a Presidential candidate yet, unless\nKen Weale can be persuaded to\nstand.\nRag Mag cont. from p.1s ceni ty and libel.\" Potter agreed to\nthese cuts, but later without a consulting the Committee, inserted a further\nbody of more, rather than less, obscene material, resulting in \" Bog's\" final form. The copies were printed\nover the vacation. Jerry Stockbridge\nhas since received a bill for 3,000\ncopies, although several informed\nsources consider that 4,000 were pro-duce d. SOLD IN MINES\nThey were delivered to the Union\nOffice at the beginning of term.\nIt seems that the original plan was to\nsell as many -as possible for a limited\nperiod of two days\u2014at least to cover\ncosts\u2014and then to have it banned ,to\nprevent it spreading too far. Be that\nas it may, on Tuesday, as reported in\nthe last issue of FELIX, Duke, together with the Executive, decided to\nban \" Bog \" for obscenity in the extreme\u2014apparently too late and in-completely. On Tuesday afternoon\nMines Vice-President John O 'Reilly,\nunaware of the ban, removed the\nMines quota from the Union office.\nOn hearing of the ban O 'Reilly\nhanded practically all of his stock to\nCarnival man Frank Morris. It is\nsaid that three were sold for the\nstated price of 2/6 in Mines. The immediate effect of the ban was to raise\nthe price, in a few cases to 10/-, before it settled to a steady 5/-.\n\u00a3100 TAKEN ?\nAlthough Potter will now have to\npay for the printing by further, stunts,\nit is certain that the total of \u00a3123 will\nin any case be offset by sales of\nbanned copies\u2014if only to a limited\nextent. Tony Duke has made some\neffort to burn as many copies as possible\u2014a few were even retrieved from\nearly buyers\u2014and puts the takings at\naround \u00a340. Others consider \u00a380 or\neven \u00a3100 more likely and it is not\nimpossible that the full cost could be\nfound. 500 copies seemed to have\nescaped incineration. If each is sold\nthe magazine could break even.\nTreble Results\n(GREECEj\n\\ for Students f\\ from\n\u00a319\n! \u00a319 |\ni LONDON\u2014 j ATHENS\u2014 \\\nLONDON \u2022\n& *\n\u00a3 iJ Weekly departures' J1 throughout \\\n5 '\n{ the long vacation %\n\\ toy special \u00a3\n\\ Express Train {\n2 to Italy and t fi en ce Jj by Cruise Liner. \\\n5 *\n* ?ost this coupon 5\n% for full colour jj brochure to Dept 55, |\n\\ \\\n\\ TYPALDOS LINES, \\\n| 12, Old Bond Street, %\nI London, W. l.I\\J| Name ff vim\n\n"

These\nare the things I demand from a potential research student.\nIn educating potential engineers, do you believe in giving\nthem as general an academic and\npractical education as possible (at\nthe undergraduate lev r..)? Or do\nyou believe in early \u00ab 1\nintensive\nspecialised study ?\nOne can over general is e education,\nbearing in mind that a seventeen-year-old in general doesn't know what\nhe wants t q do. I believe in the in d liv i dual: if a chap knows what he\nwants to do it is tragic if the sharp\nedge of his enthusiasm is blunted by\nextra courses on topics which do not\ninterest him. My personal ambition is\nto raise another Maxwell or Faraday,\nnot just a generation of good engineers. My department subscribes in\nthe main to broad education. I have\nbeen accused of lecturing only to potential research students \u2014 perhaps\nfairly, but it annoys me that a third\nyear specialist in my subject gets only\neleven lectures from me and forty-four from L.S.E. In America a large number of\nengineering graduates go into\nbusiness and civil administration.\nIs this a trend in Britain ?\nAmong the people who run\nBritain's industries to-day, there are\nstill many who are self-made men.\nBusiness management, for instance, is\noften composed largely of men who\nhave risen from the shop floor. Unfortunately their minds are for the\nmost part not formally trained, and\nthey are handicapped by a lack of\nrespect for academic's. In a sense,\nBritain is waiting for these men to\nretire. Engineers should then fill\nsome of these managerial and administrative posts, but whether this is a trend or not, I dont know. It should\nbe.\nDo you think it is the job of\nthis college to produce engineers\nand scientists\u2014or technologists in\ngeneral\u2014for industry, or people\nwho are more generally qualified\nfor management and the civil\nservice ?\nFirst of all, let me say that engineers and scientists are the same thing.\nI feel quite strongly about this, for\nmany people in high places are stating\npublicly that an engineer is not a scientist.\nNationally speaking, the Germans\nand the British are best at producing\nnew ideas, and these are what we\nshould try to export. To do it, we\nmust be good at engineering. Thus\nthe most important thing for this\ncountry is to encourage the best\nstudents to study applied science at\nuniversity. At the G.C.E. level, the\nonly sciences they know are physics,\nmaths and chemistry. And this is all\ntheir teachers know. Thus if senior\npeon le keep emphasising that engineering is not science, the brighter\nscience students in schools will simply\nnot choose it as a career and the\ncountry will suffer. I am sure that\ntoo often the advice of a careers master is : \" If you are not good enough\nto read physics, you can always do\nengineering.\" They should explain\nthat there is engineering science and\npure science.\nI try to attract good students from\nthe schools into applied science\nthrough my membership of one of the\nG.C.E. Examination Advisory Boards,\nwhich advise on syllabus revision.\nOne of the main io bs of the college\nis to encourage the best students we\nhave. If we don't, no one else will.\nAfter that we can also hope to produce good people for industry including management.\nHow would you feel about the\nintroduction of schools of business administration and of the\nsocial sciences into Imperial\nCollege ?\nThis will be all right if the people\ntaking business administration are\ndoing it instead of, not as well as, en-g in ee ring. Our students are busy\nenough as it is; they don't have\nenough time to pursue their own in-te rests. That is partly inevitable because of the amount to be learned\u2014\nwe can't teach them all they have to\nknow in three years. It all goes back\nto the will to learn : oppose the stu-dents' wishes and you'll make them,\ndull boys. Tell them what's good for\nthem and they won't like it. I think\nengineers should be given the option\nof not doing general studies, for ex-ample. Let the bright students specialise ; if a student has brains, he will\nlearn about things outside his own\nfield of special is ation anyway.\nDo you conceive Imperial College as expanding eventually into\na university with a full spectrum\nof humanities ?\nNo. Other parts of the University\nof London do this ; why should we ?\nBesides we haven't enough space for\nour existing facilities, let alone room\nfor expansion. 1 would like to see\nI.C. become the M.I.T. of England\nby concentrating on being best at\nwhat we are already doing.\nWhat is your principal problem\nin organising research at the present time ?\nI think perhaps, getting enough\nhands and brains to do the work. In\nthe last few years none of our new\ngraduates have stayed on for research.\nIt is hoped that after a period in industry they will return, but once a man has worked in industry and got\nmarried, he's not going to come back\nto do postgraduate work at \u00a3800 a year or so. As a result, we have not\nenough people to try out all the ids as we should like\nIt is relatively easy to get money\nfor research equipment but incredibly\ndifficult to get a man's salary and this\nseems to be a very curious national\npolicy.\nMartin Walker, who has\nwritten this series of articles on\nprominent academic figures in\nIC. is a Canadian and graduate\nof Carlton University, Ottawa,\nwhere he worked on the student newspaper. He is now a postgraduate in physics.\nA CAREER IN\nTha KaJdo steel-making process. Today, o yer half of Britain's steel comes from processes developed within the past ten ye an.
