If so you\nare invited to have a German measles blood\ntest at the Health Centre\nIn the summer of 1983 there was a marked\nincrease in the number of cases of German\nmeasles in the UK. The importance of this\nrelatively trivial disease is the effect it has on\nthe foetus of a woman who contracts it in the\nfirst three months of pregnancy. The baby\nmay be born blind or deaf or with a heart\nabnormality or any combination of these.\nOnce a woman has immunity to the disease\nit is very unlikely that she will contract it\nagain. Many women may have been im munis ed against the disease at the age of 12 or 13\nand many others may believe they have had it\nand so be immune. Unfortunately there are\nother virus infections which may appear indistinguishable from German measles and\nsome women mistakenly believe they have\nhad the disease. A simple blood test can\ndetermine whether you have rubella (Germ-an measles) antibodies and thus are immune\nfrom further infection.\nIf you are not immune you may be im munis ed with a single injection with no serious\nside effects. You should not have this injection in early pregnancy or within 3 months\nof conceiving. An ideal time to have it therefore is at a time when there is no chance of you\nbecoming pregnant. All women under 40 are\nwelcome at the Health Centre for such a blood test and im munis ation as ne cesar y. Please come to see the nurse on Wednesdays or Thursdays between 9:30 and 11:30am for the rubella blood test. You will be informed within 2 weeks whether you have\nimmunity or whether im munis ation is indicated.

    "content": "Letters H Large Bore\nSlug\nDear Pallab\nRe last week's letter by 'Slug':\nfor those not in the know, 'Slug'\nis Steve Bishop, who as ex-President of City and Guilds\nUnion and a prominent member of Links Club probably\nknows as much as anyone at\nImperial about bar nights and\ndrinking clubs.\nUnfortunately on this occasion Steve has got hold of the\nwrong end of the stick and\nchewed it into a pile of verbal\nsawdust. What he seems to be\ntrying to say (and it really is not\nclear) is that in the Handbook I should have described the\nUnion Bar as it was five years\nago or as it could, with luck, be\nlater this year but certainly not\nas it was at the time of writing.\nNothing (well, almost nothing)\nwould have pleased me more\nthan to have been able to\ndescribe the bar as \"the lively,\nknock-about bar of y ester year\". Unhappily, it wasn't, it\nstill isn't, and as I had no reason\nto tell fresher s otherwise, I didn't. Steve does not suspect that 1\nwrote parts of the Handbook;\nhe knows it perfectly well. But\nin a confused kind of way, he\nimagines that as I was Editor,\nactually writing things as well\nwas somehow cheating, and\nthat therefore I am not to be\ntrusted. Oddly enough, as\nFELIX News Editor last year I wrote quite a lot of news, and\nnobody complained then.\n(Wanna bet?-Ed.)\nBut if Steve is really sure that\nI have forced a nasty, warped,\ndepraved view of Imperial upon\nunsuspecting fresher s he might\nread page 6, on which Hugh\nSouthey. the Chairman of the\nInternal Services Committee,\nhad independently reached the\nsame conclusions as I did not\nonly on the Union Bar but also\non the other bars and re fec tories.\nOther than a few predictable\ncomplaints from people who\nview the Handbook as a free\nadvertising service, I have so far\nreceived very little useful feedback from those for whom the\nHandbook was actually writ-ten.\nAnyone with criticism, suggestions or (unlikely, this) praise\nfor the Handbook can contact\nme directly via physics UG letter-racks or the FELIX Office.

This was sad considering the\nimportance of encouraging as\nmany new people as possible to\nget involved.\nThe Union is important as\nthe decisions that it takes affect\nall the students in the College,\nbut to make it democractic it\nneeds to be seen to be relevant\nto a complete cross-section of\nthe College which is not the\npresent case.\nYours hopefully\nRoger Preece\nSilver\nMachine\nDear Pallab\nWe feel that Urgent (if not\nimmediate) action is required to\nchange the Union games machines so that any member of-our illustrious, free and democratic Union can enter the\nUnion games room and pur-chase, with a single two shilling\ncoin, a one player game of\neither Space Dual or Centipede,\naccording to his right as a citizen of this ancient and\ndistinguished realm, instead of\nhaving to use, one of those p oxy5 p imitation, twenty pence\n'coins'.\nChristine Teller is (irresponsible as usual.\nYours distraught lyS Little\nT Hird\nS Turton\nJ McPhee\nJ Mocek\nPS: Don't forget the Badgesoc\nBilingual Banana-Feast (free\ndrink y poo s and grub) 1:00pm Upper Lounge, Friday 14 and\ndemonstration.\nAmewsed\nResident\nDear Sir\nI was sorry to see, in your\nedition of 3 October, the headline \"No fun in Southside\u2014\nOfficial\", above an article\nwhich might give the impression that Mews residents are a lot of humour less killjoys.

I'm depressed by the total\nabsence of black and white holiday snaps\nwith the Spanish Inquisition in the back-ground. I want the office flooded with\nsports photographs by 5:00pm next Monday.\nFootball Club, you've been very\nnaughty children. I said no lists of teams.\nI 've let you off this time but if it happens\nagain you will be edited.\nAs for the clubs that didn't even send in\narticles, I denounce you as contemptible.\nWhose fault do you think it is that the\nignorant plebs are forced to read such a load of boring crap. Speaking of boring\ncrap, next year's President Ian Bull, you\nknow-the one with the funny face, is going\nto put in an article explaining details of our\naffiliation to the Universities Athletics\nUnion. This should make next week's FELIX much more exciting!\nFinally, it's my birthday today, so if\nanyone wants to buy me a drink or two,\nI 'll make it worth your while!\nJohn Scott\nIC3 v IC2 3-0\nThe new season began at a windy Harlington\nlast Saturday with a well contested friendly\nbetween the thirds and the seconds. A slightly\nflattering score line perhaps but the thirds well\nworth their victory in terms of commitment\nand work rate. Steady performances from all of last year's thirds encouraged new players Tom Dutton.\nMartin Barnes and Mark Whitehead to show\nwell but it was old hands (feet?) Torsten\nBehling and Anton Milner (2) who provided\nthe goals in this game. With the welcome\nreturn of a Speedy Stevie (Coussens) we only\nawait the re-emergence of Big Ron from the\ndepths of chemistry to complete the rebuilding of this once famous outfit!\nTeam: P Simpson, J Barden, C Gordon\n(Capt). D Kelland. R Heath; T Dutton. A Milner. P Snedker. M Barnes. M Whitehead, T Behling. S Coussens.\n-Flash\nAnd God spoke saying: \"The thronging multitudes which did join the Cycling Club hath\nsinned greatly, and hath fille th their glasses at\nthe fountain of all evil, the Union Bar. Yea.\nverily shalt they be punished. 1 shalt cause\ntheir surroundings to spin dizzily about them\nthat they shalt not be able to stand eth.\" But lo, six dared oppose His will and\ncometh to Beit Arch. So the Lord in his anger\nsend eth forth storms and water pour eth from\nheaven. But they continue th on their way to\nEpsom ceasing only to negotiate the one way\nsystems the Lord had placed in their way.\nAnd yea, the Lord see-eth their determination\nand had mercy upon them, and He hold eth back the floods, help eth them on their journey to the winding lanes of Box Hill. And so\nthe six return eth with tales of wondrous\nlands to be explored. Details of the next\nexodus to these fertile lands appear eth on the\nnoticeboard on the Sherfield Walkway.\n(Well copied from last year's Badminton's report-Ed.)\nAll those of you who signed our list at\nFreshers' Fair legibly will by now know two\ndetails. For the rest of you, here they are:\nThe club will be organising a trip to Risail\nin the French Alps leaving 18 December and\nreturning 24 Dec. Cost will be approx \u00a3122.\nThis includes coach fare, self-catering accommodation, equipment hire, ski school and ski\npass. Obviously, it won't cost as much if you\nhave your own boots/skis or want to live in a snow cave.\nWe need deposits (\u00a326.85) as soon as pos-sib le. In addition, we will be doing some dry\nskiing at Hillingdon on Tuesday evenings.\nContact A J Harpham. Mech Eng 3 or Room\n5843. Southwell House for details etc.\nTrack and\nill te g Field\nEver had sand kicked into your face? Are you\nlacking in awesome super-human powers?\nIf these are your problems then the Track\nand Field Athletics Club will work wonders\nfor you.\nThe club has been out of action for a year\nand so needs hundreds of new members, male\nand female.\nTo start the shot rolling, we are having a short meeting at 12:30pm today in the Union\nGym (2nd level, Union Building, Beit Quad)\nso we want to see you there to start the\nprestige club of IC. (Who are you trying to\nkid?-Ed.)\nIf you can't make it contact me in the\nPhysics letter-racks.\nYou want fame? Be there!\nWe are starting informal coaching sessions on\nFridays practice nights from 6:30 to 7:30 in\nthe Volleyball Court. First session is tonight.\nMatches start tomorrow, so it's important\nthat any of last year's players who haven't come along to a practice, get in touch soon, or\nwe'll assume you've left.\nFirst impressions are that the club is nowhere near as strong as it was last year, but\nwe'll probably still win everything.\nI 'll be organising far more social events this\nyear, so any suggestions for something different will be most welcome.\nThe Chess Club seems to have conveniently\nforgotten that it is due to be drunk under the\ntable and thrashed at darts, due to its impertinence last year. If they want to be branded\nas cowards and Horlicks drinkers by the rest\nof IC, then I suggest they contact us as soon as\npossible.\nLast Saturday witnessed the first outing of the\nCross Country Club. Eight members of the\nclub made the trip to a windswept course at\nBristol. In the Ladies Race Mandy Tindall\nran well to finish third. The Mens Race saw\nthe emergence of a new star, Sam Carey, who\ncame 25th, followed home by Jon Lea and\nGraham Harker. The 'practical joker of the\nweek' award must go to Bob Morrison, who\ntried to convince everyone it was a two-lap\nrace, instead of three, and 'sucker of the week'\naward goes to the two or three who believed\nhim!\nThe Golf Club must be one of the smallest\nsports clubs at IC. Sad really when you look\nat what the club can offer the golfer. Apart\nfrom the usual \u00a32.25 fee, there are no particular entry requirements. Any gung e you may\nhave read about just people with good handicaps playing are out of date, and sad reminders of better days. The club at present is\nnot affiliated to any local club. A player goes\nalong to one of the local clubs and pays the\ngreen fees, keeps his receipt and sends it to the\nCaptain or Treasurer of the club who arranges for reimbursement of the fees. This is\nhow the club has operated over the past few\nyears and because of this there has been a lack\nof club atmosphere with players remaining\nanonymous. This year I propose to arrange\nsome 'social' events and at least one club\ntournament. So anyone who is interested, but\ndid not come to the stall at Freshers' Fair fear\nnot you can get in touch via the letter-racks.\nMartin Ross (Roscoe)\nChem Eng 3\n(Captain 1983/4)\nPage 12 Friday, October 14, 1983] FELIX\n\n"

The 'Moonies' are an\ninsidious religious cult who prey on lost or lonely young\npeople. They will seem very friendly and will probably\ninvite you back to their place for a meal. Do not go. They\nare very dangerous and are out to make you part of their\nsect. Once you get involved they make it very difficult for\nyou to leave.

However, the problem can\nbe solved as follows:\nSince no-one can deduce their own, no-one has\nbeen told of the two firsts. If Alan had got a first, then\nsomeone would have been told of the two first, since\nall but Alan were told of his mark and no pair was\nrepeated. Therefore Alan got a third.\nAlan was not told of two firsts but can deduce all\nnonetheless. So he was told of two thirds other than\nhis own. As soon as he knows he got a third, he\nknows that the two he was not told about got firsts.\nBarry is told by Alan that he (Alan) was not told his\n(Barry's), so he (Barry) got a first.\nChris knows his now, so he must have known of\nAlan's third and the first of someone other than\nBarry, hence Chris got a third.\nThey all know now that Barry got a first and Alan\nand Chris got thirds. Since this is enough to tell\nElaine what she got, then she must have been told of\nAlan's and Diana's result. Chris was told of Alan and\nthe person other than Barry to get a first, and since\nno two people were given the same pair of results,\nChris could not have been given Alan's and Diana's, as Elaine got them. Therefore Diana did not get a first so she got a third, leaving Elaine as other one to get a first. I think the answer is more baffling than the\nquestion!\nNobody got the crossword totally right, but the\nbest was only one mistake. The randomly selected\nwinners are Caroline and Sara of Physics 2.\nThere were eight correct answers for the exam\nresults questions. Thanks to those who explained\ntheir reasoning; I hope those who got it wrong can\nnow see why. The randomly selected winner was A Shiekh, a Physics PG.

Unfortunately the\nsoulless san it is ed sound didn't offer\nmuch temptation to do this and they\nlacked the imagination to inspire with\ntheir seemingly improvised sound.\nHowever at least they were trying\nsomething new which is more than can\nbe said for the Blue Orphans who stood\n'in for the Watuzi Brothers at the last\nminute. 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration they may have been but genius\nthey 'certainly were not. Apparently quite\na few A&R men from various record\ncompanies had come to see them but I doubt if they will be appearing on vinyl in\nthe near future. An almost note-for-note\ncopy of the Stones' '19th Nervous Breakdown' was one of the few highlights in\ntheir set.\nTne best received of the support\nbands were The Slide from Cardiff but\nunfortunately for both us and them this\nwas their last gig. This band played a J CR party during Freshers' Week last\nyear but have been unable to find a record deal in the meantime. They included a version of Patti Smith's 'Because\nthe Night' in their set and their punk ish energy and vitality won them a well-deserved encore.\nClint Eastwood and General Saint\nweren't breaking up as the pre-gig rumour had suggested, they hadn't got lost\nbeforehand as they said on the stage and\nit was a night to remember as FELIX\npromised last Friday.\nBacking group the Inity Band took the\nstage around 12:30 and immediately\nThe Primary\nThe Slide\nshowed they could win over the crowd\nwithout the help of the front two. The beauty with reggae music when it's this\ngood is that you don't have to have heard\nit before to enjoy it. The music is exuberant and when it's sung by a duo as\ndynamic as CE and GS it's unbeatable.\nThe performance was not totally\nreggae and that was its only fault: rock\ninfluences such as the extended buildups at the ends of songs and drum solos\nduring introductions tended to lesson\nthe impact of songs.\nThe show was mostly uptempo and\nonly during the slow 'Nuclear Crisis' was\nthere any sign of crowd unrest but this\nwas only because the band had\nproclaimed their support for C ND. However the song ends superbly with the\nkeyboards echoing apocalyptic ally of\nDoors of all bands.\nThe band have been together for\naround five years now and released two\nalbums on the Greensleeves label: Two\nBad DJ and Stop that Train\u2014although\nthey are now being courted by some of\nthe majors. Last Friday was the first date\nin a nationwide tour and considering\nthey have already reached the stage\nwhere their audience is principally\nwhite, been one of the headliners at the\nBrockwell Park peace concert in front of\nabout 40,000 people and possess songs\nof the popularity and calibre of 'Another\nbites the dust' it can't be too long before\nthey're too big to play Imperial College\nagain.\nPage 6\nClint Eastwood and General Saint\n\u2022HBBFriday.

    "content": "Bmmm\nKm* V'<4 WRITE REPLY\nAnti- Porn Crusader\nMichael Newman writes\nto protest about the\npeddling of pornography\nby the Union.\nA motion was defeated at\nthe U GM on Thursday 6th October by mano eve rings using a wild interpretation of\nthe Union standing orders\nand the now famous Mines\nblock vote. The motion sought to stop the Union\nselling pornographic entertainment. FELIX has been\nprinting drawings and photographs seeking to provoke\nemotional replies and fill the\nletters page. Is it not about\ntime we heard the rational\narguments!\nI issue a challenge to the\nMines Union and to Imperial\nCollege Union to defend their\nposition, not with boos and\nhisses from a 'Save Mines\nAction Squad' or misuses of\nthe U GM standing orders,\nbut in a formal debate\nchaired by Debsoc. I personally do not think they can\nsucceed.\nBritish society restricts the\nsale of pornography. Its laws\ndo not allow anyone under\neighteen to buy such material.\nShops are not allowed to\nexhibit such goods in their\nwindows. The production\nand importing of pornography is severely restricted.\nIt is widely recognised that\nporn is degrading and even\ncorrupting. Most debates\nrevolve around freedom to\nbuy and sell, not the consequences of doing so.\nThe debate within college,\nan unavoidable debate so\nlong as Mines continue to sell\nporn, is whether the arguments behind the British laws\nare correct. It is not about the\nindividual freedom to buy\nand sell this material. Students, along with ali other\nBritish subjects over the age\nof 18, have the right to buy\nporn. It is about a democratic\nbody selling pornographic\nenter rta in ment. This means\nevery single member of the\nUnion is a party to its sale. If\na Union sells pornography\nthen the organisers cannot be\nheld entirely responsible, for\nthe Union is responsible and\nthe Union is its members, you\nand me.\nOnce this is made absolutely clear, the 'fight for\nfreedom' argument is dis-f missed and all of us are left\ni with the question 'do I want\nto sell pornography?' To consciously say yes is to\nignore the arguments put\nforward by all governments\n(including the present one)\nand this society in general.\nYour answer cannot be the\nsame as the pornographic\nindustry's as you personally\ndo not benefit from the sales.\nThe only rational motive can\nbe that you wish to further\nthe interests of the industry\nbecause it is good. You wish\nto tell everyone 'I am for\nporn because it is good.'\nSo long as Mines and\nImperial College Union express their active support\nfor this industry, then we as\nindividuals do. So long as\nthis situation remains we\nshould do our utmost to\nchange it. We should express\nin words what is expressed so\nwell in actions, that our\nUnion supports pornography.\ngp ME MlNE-KS be Mg TH lS IMAC,Er\\ NP m\\ \u00a3 R^H? pi t3>o S oF y THE HS LL Vfl S TfOiNQ To MAlMTWrVfT\n\\FELIX\nTHE DF HoMANSetNC;\n' EO Eec VF THr S VeRY QUICKLY\nAND F \u00a3-MAL& M/k/ GES?\n(i DON'T WAKITTO\"^\nWITH Tw IS.'BuN GH\nOF STfeip/o Type x> The. fia oT.

Under the new captaincy of Pete\nCunningham the 1st XI fell foul of NPL,\nlosing 3-1, though had a few early chances not\neluded conversion the game may have acquired a different hue. Conducive to defeat\nwas the neophyte nature of the team; the play\nat times was frenetic and lacking in pattern,\nand this, combined with a shaky defence lead\nto a half time deficit of two goals, despite the\nleviathan Geoff Ayres. Keen fresher s bolstered all XI's, their enthusiasm meant a second half recovery in both the 1st and 2nd XI games, sustaining the action to the very\nend. Undoubtedly the teams will build on the\nfoundations already laid and the results can,\nand will, only improve. Personally I leave the\nrest up to the more acrostic among you.\nThe London Student Ten Pin Bowling Club is\nbased at Imperial College. However, the centre of the club's activities is situated at\nTolworth Bowl, south west of London. A coach leaves Imperial College at 2:30pm every Wednesday during term time.\nIn addition to bowling every Wednesday,\nthe Club selects its best players to compete in\nthe National Universities League, bowling at\nhome and away to Brunei, Southampton and,\nPortsmouth in the Southern regional league.\nThe winners of this section go on to the\nnational finals.\nEven if you are not good enough to be\npicked for the club, you can still bowl in the\ntournaments organised by many universities\nand colleges over the country, all of which are\nhandicap\u2014so you could be the worst player\nin our club and still win a tournament with\nnot too great a performance.\nSo, even if you have never played before,\ncome along on Wednesday (or any Wednesday for that matter). You'll probably see\nplayers who've been for years and still look as\nthough they've just started!\nThe meeting place is Chem Eng foyer.\nLooking forward to seeing you.\nWmWkWmW Spo\nf SOUTHSIDE BAR\nEvents This Week\nEvery Friday\nDisco in the Real Ale Bar\nComing Wednesday\nSam Smiths promotion-55p!

    "content": "Twisted Mind\nTwisted Body\nCriminal\nRecord\nMore\nMoonies\nMembers of the United Unification Church, or Moonies us\nthey are better known, have been\nattempting to recruit IC students\n;i round campus and the Halls of\nResidence throughout the past\ntwo weeks.\nThe sect have not revealed\ntheir name to the people they\nhave approached but have merely\nasked them to fill in a question-n aire. An invitation to a free meal\nat their Lancaster Gate headquarters is then offered.\nFreshers\nBalls Up\nTwo Albert Hall Mansion residents were up in arms over the\nfull-blooded reggae sound of\nClint Eastwood and General\nSaint as they blasted out during\nthe small hours of Saturday morning at the Freshers Ball.\nThe band were playing well\nafter they were supposed to stop\nbecause they started their session\nan hour late due to General Saint\n'getting himself lost'.\nThe residents called in the po-lice, who warned President\nGaynor Lewis of possible legal\naction. Miss Lewis defused a potentially explosive situation by\nkeeping the police away from the\nUnion Building while the band\nwere playing.\nAlarm in\nMines\nThe Royal School of Mines building was evacuated on Tuesday\nmorning as hordes of gas-masked\nfiremen leapt through the windows in a fire drill.\nThe firemen entered a third\nfloor window and successfully\nbrought out a dummy from\namidst the smoke and flames.\nThe firemen were hindered in\ntheir daring rescue by hundreds\nof students congregating in the\ndoorways.\nThe College fire officer, Mr\nBob Foggon pointed out that this\nwas a major safety hazard and\nappealed to students to stay well\nclear of buildings in a event of a fire alert.\nMr Foggon denied that the incident was a cleverly disguised\nmascot ry raid by QMC.\nA scientist from the Metropolitan\nPolice Forensic Science Department gave an entertaining,\nthough rather gory, lecture to an\naudience of over 70 in Elec Eng\nlecture theatre 408 at the invitation last Monday of the HG Wells Society.\nThe talk was illustrated by\nslides from the Department's files\nshowing bodies which had\nsuffered horrific injuries, such as\nsmashed skulls or abdominal\ntwisting. Others showed maggot-eaten corpses and the aftermath\nof an attack by alsatian dogs.\nSick bags were unfortunately not\nprovided.\nThe talk also covered the latest\ntechniques used by the police\nsuch as laser interference\nmethods for detection of footprints on carpets and other\nsurfaces long after they were\nmade.\nMeanwhile, controversy continued to rage over the design of\nthe poster advertising the event.\nThe poster depicted a naked man\nwielding an axe over two naked\nwomen, one of whom has been\ndecapitated. If a formal complaint is made to the Union.\nWellsoc could face a fine as they\ndid last year for producing\nobscene publicity. However, the\nman from the Met apparently\napproved of the design and took\none away with him to show his\ncolleagues at Scotland Yard.\nNew Sport\nShop\nThe sale of sports goods and\nregalia has been transferred from\nSouthside Shop to a new Union\nShop on the Shcrfield Walkway.\nDeputy President Christine\nTeller said she felt that a better\nservice could be offered by\nhaving separate outlets for groceries and sports equipment.\nThieves started early this session\nin the College libraries. Thefts of\nwallets, purses and other personal belongings are an all too\nfamiliar occurrence here as in all\nthe other colleges of the University, but on Tuesday 27 September a more daring raid was made\non the Haldane Music Library.\nWhile the Music Librarian was at\nlunch a thief climbed through the\nenquiries window from the Music\nLibrary into the locked office and\nstole the cartridges from the two\nrecord decks used for the Listen> ing Room, together with a cash-box containing money belonging\nto the Youth and Music group\nrun by the Music Librarian to\nobtain discounts on concert\ntickets.\nSince the theft occurred al the\nbusiest time of day, it is possible\nthat someone saw the thief. Any\ninformation would be welcomed\nby the Haldane Librarian and\nwould be treated in confidence.\nWham Bam Thank you Mam!\nImperial College Rag got off to a flying start with City and Guilds and the Royal College of\nScience Unions taking over Covent Garden and Halls of Residence respectively. Guilds raised the\nincredible sum of \u00a3359 by allowing members of the public to splatter them with flan s and shifting 600\ndubious Rag Mags. STOIC, the under watched College TV station with their usual panache also\nmanaged to get totalling covered in shaving foam. RCS not to be outdone raised a meagre \u00a385 by\ncollecting in UL U Halls of Residence.\nFELIX Friday, October 14, 1983 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nWALKABOUTLONDON\n\u00bby Mobile Optics lee.\nb1. Covent Garden\nWalkabout London was born in a pair of\ncomfortable shoes on an afternoon of excruciating lab work. I set off with no very\nobvious end point in mind, ie went\nWALKABOUT. Armed with this column\nyou will discover un dreamt of bits of\nLondon, visit the odd museum or picture\ngallery, find a source of cinnabar green\nartists' paint, the best espresso coffee in\nLondon and much, much more!\nIn the midst of theatre land lies fashion-conscious fitness land. Between the craft\nstalls and bus kers of the redeveloped Covent\nGarden Market, and the amusement arcades\nand hot-dog stands of Leicester Square, run\nLong Acre and Floral Street. They are the\nnatural habitat of stylish street athletes and a happy hunting ground for people-watchers\nand flan eur s alike.\nAerobics\nMedical evidence has shown, so we are\ninformed, that there is a need regularly to\nwork the heart up to a 'training zone' level:\n150 beats a minute-and to maintain this level\nfor around 15 minutes: this is 'aerobic'\nexercise. It's all about sustained effort, rather\nthan the short bursts of'explosive' movement\ninvolved in squash or in fast-moving team\nsports, which are primarily anaerobic.\n\"Regular aerobic exercise is one of the best\nways of keeping our body in an optimum\ncondition\"\u2014I'm quoting, sitting cross-legged on my bed, where I 've been firmly\nplanted for the last three hours doing nothing\nmore strenuous than drinking coffee and\nscribbling\u2014I'm full of good intentions! The\nspirit is willing but the flesh is\nweak...tomorrow maybe?! A workout? A dance routine?\nOut in the sunshine on Floral Street, I sought inspiration at the Dance Centre. Open\nseven days a week, the Dance Centre runs\nclasses for absolute beginners to\nprofessionals. They range from New York\nStretch to Contemporary Jazz and most last\none hour. Cost is from \u00a32 upwards, paid to\nthe teacher in the studio. A daily membership\nfee of 35p covers use of showers, changing\nrooms and the health bar area, which sounds\nlike it could be friendly as well as healthy. The\nDance Centre also has its own shop, carrying\na range of striped and shiny-bright leotards,\nT shirts, shorts and dance shoes.\nAs an alternative way to aerobic health and\nPage 8\nwell-being, by jogging. The necessary gear\nwill be found at the London Runner, 119\nLong Acre (open 7 days a week) or at Cobra,\nno 38. Select shorts, vests and the essential\nrunning shoe that will absorb the shocks of\nconstant pounding on city streets.\nPedal Power\nThe London Bicycle Company, 41-42 Floral\nStreet, offers an escape to fresh air. Their\n'own brand' bicycles range from the bestselling Londoner 'Black Diamond 10' made\nby Falcon Cycles and based on the Black\nDiamond (\u00a3139.95), to the top model\nLondoner 'Dalesman' (and 'Ladydale'): the\nframe is a Reynolds 531 butted throughout,\nfitted with Campag Rally gears and Wolber\nInvulnerable tyres (\u00a3299). Bike Events has its\nLondon Office in one corner of the shop and\nwill take your registration for any of their\nsponsored rides. Recently the Bath-London\nBike Ride on 28 August helped raise funds for\nAction Research for the Crippled Child;\nHadrian's Ride (25 September), in aid of the\nBritish Heart Foundation, followed the\nspectacular route from Carlisle to Tyneside,\nalong the military road parallel to Hadrian's Wall.\nThe cartographic ally minded can buy maps\nat Stanfords, 12-24 Long Acre. The World's largest map shop supplies travellers with\nguide books to the four corners of the earth,\nand sells such daydreamers' delights as the\nChina Railway Map (\u00a31.25).\nHaving shed a pound or two and gained in\nsuppleness and muscle tone,find vitamin rich\nrefreshment at the entrance to the tube\nstation.\nNeed the fitness freak live in\nrunning shorts?\nSports-related aren't out, just rather\nobvious\u2014the body-conscious silhouette is\nbuilt from supple style\u2014a mixture of\ncomfortable basics and casual fashion.\nFeature\ntorn\nFlip Clothing Warehouse, 125-6 Long\nAcre, is open seven days a week (until\nmidnight Mon-Sat). New and used American\nclothing is imported directly and sold at\ndiscount prices. All is cleaned and freshly\npressed for sale, though the odd button may\nbe missing. Hunt out garish Hawaiian shirts\n(\u00a36.99), khaki army shorts from \u00a34.99, and\npale pastel overalls (\u00a311.99). Pristine Fruitof-the-Loom T shirts, printed with a discrete\nFlip logo, are \u00a33.99.\nWhen elegance, rather than thrift, is the\naim, invest in classic chic at Blazer, 37 Long\nAcre. Pleated cotton trousers by Egon von\nFurstenburg, have a diagonal weave or hairline stripe, from \u00a335.\nCut a dash in Madras check cotton shirts\n(from \u00a320) pleated and tapered cotton\ntrousers and, in case of summer\nthunderstorms, a feather weight rubber is ed cotton raincoat (\u00a363)\u2014all from Paul Smith,\n44 Floral Street. At No-Yes, on the corner of\nLangley Court, girls find designer cottons,\ninspired by the desert colours and\nFriday, October 12, 1983 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 BB archaeological discoveries in the Nile Valley:\ncity-black T shirts, printed with palest blue\nand sand squiggles, are \u00a36.99; crisp cotton\ndresses from about \u00a340.\nThus elegantly attired, pose in style at the\nCafe des Amis du Vin, 12-13 Hanover Place,\nopen from noon till 11:30pm. With Juan\nGris' Cubist collage in the mind's eye, order\nespresso, or smooth milky ca pucci no coffee\n(50p), and Croque Monsieur (\u00a3 1.55). The Bar\ndes Amis is open during normal licencing\nhours: Les Amis Claret (\u00a35.25 bottle) heads a comprehensive wine list.\nWhat to do at sunset?\nRound the corner, at 48 Floral Street, book\nseats at the Covent Garden Box Office. The\nRoyal Opera House is sub sidi sed by the Arts\nCouncil of Great Britain, whose shop is at 8\nLong Acre, open 10:00am7:45 pm Mon-Sat.\nThe culturally inclined select from a wealth of\nbooks on the performing and visual arts,\ncollect picture postcards from regional\ngalleries (15p), and catch up on missed\nexhibitions with British and international art\nexhibition catalogues.\nNight owls have more fun than just\nshopping at the Covent Garden General\nStore, open till midnight Mon-Sat opposite\nCovent Garden tube. Baskets, Moses-sized or\nminiature (from 20p), will accommodate all\npurchases. Cafe-style china jostles for shelf-space with enamel mugs and coffee pots.\nPaper, in rainbow colours, is sold by\nweight\u2014loz sombre grey envelopes (27p) to\ncamouflage exuberant yellow paper (18p for\nloz). Albany Orchards Original English Jelly\nBeans are justly as brightly coloured\u2014try\nlime green or raspberry pink, at 55p for lOO g. The amateur barman will find everything\nnecessary for the well shaken cocktail, down\nto the essential paper parasol.\nThose more intent on consuming than\nproducing might, at this point, retire to\nGiordano's Antipasto Bar. Tehre, indulge in\na Harvey Wallbanger or Tequila Sunrise; all\ncocktails are \u00a31.50 during the 'Happy Hour',\nfrom 6:00-9:00pm Mon-Sat. After an\nexhausting day spent ache i ving fitness and\nclothing the new-look, lean-line body,\nGiordino's plate of assorted salamis, served\nwith crisp salad and fresh bread seems very\nmodestly priced at \u00a32.50.\nCafe Breakfast, by Juan Gris..\nHH HH HH HH HH H Pa\n9* 9\n\n"
