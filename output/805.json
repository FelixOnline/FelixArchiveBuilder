    "content": "Letters\nSabbatical\ncredibility\nDear Judith,\nThanks for your full page editorial of last week. It does\nserve to explain a little of why you do things the way you\ndo. It does not however absolve you from what a number\nof people feel you have been guilty of, which is unfair\nand biased reporting.\nI agree entirely that FELIX should 'inform, entertain\nand criticise'. FELIX has been informative. FELIX in\ncertain editions has even been entertaining. Above all\nFELIX certainly has been critical. Congratulations, Judith,\nyou've achieved your aims, but what good has it done?\nIn answer, none whatsoever! You know as well as I do\nthat the Union without the support of its students is almost\npowerless within College. In fact at this point in time\nCollege dictates to the students how they should live, what\nthey should study, what they should eat, how their money\nis spent etc. Can I take it that all the students are happy\nwith this because they don't voice their opinions? Or is\nit that the students don't have the interest or the confidence\nin the Union to support it fully? My guess is the latter.\nIt's not only inside of College that the Union has to have\nsome kind of credibility. Potentially, with the facilities\nand resources it has available, ie rooms, trading outlets,\nvans etc, the Union could almost be self-funding. To\ncompete it has to appear professional and organised. In\nfuture, with the introduction of Gerbill, the Union may\ncease to get funding from College, isn't it wise that\nsomebody should be trying to ensure the future of the\nUnion. The aim of the new job descriptions and the\nemployment of the new Union staff is to try and portray\nan air of professionalism and organisation. Against a lot\nof inertia from people who would like to discuss things\nyear in, year out, before anything is done, Sydney\nHarbour-Bridge (ne Howgate) has finally got the ball\nrolling. You may feel it's going in the wrong direction,\nit's up to the students to direct it.\nYou have been very critical of the Union and especially\nof Sydney but has this criticism been at all constructive?\nHas it hell! You've taken relations between the Union,\nFELIX and the students quite a few steps backward and\nin so doing have made the Union a laughing stock within\nCollege. Now, I believe that you're only trying to point\nout the many things that are wrong with the Union by your\ncriticism but the manner in which you've criticised has\nbeen totally destructive. Your citi c is m has been levelled\non quite a personal basis, it has been quite often unfair,\nthough not always unjust, and it has been too selective.\nWhy is it that Sydney's received all the shit for not having\nwritten to FELIX when Alan Rose has written just as little\nand has received no 'criticism'? This is one but longstanding affair.\nI agree FELIX should not be solely a mouthpiece for\nthe Union but it should be aiming to promote the Union\nas a body of students with the potential to twist the arm\nof College so that actions are taken to benefit the students\nas a whole as those students feel fit. You're right the\nPresident is a puppet but he's a puppet of the students'.\nA puppet is useless without the right people pulling the\nstrings, ie the students. A puppet is also useless without\nthe right character and personality to perform in every\nsense of the word.\nJudith you are the biggest mouthpiece in College (and\nby that I mean through FELIX). You may not have a vote\non'any committees but that's because you have to be seen\nto be impartial as an editor. Please use the opportunity\nwisely and criticise constructively. You know full well\nthat Sydney has the ability to sway meetings to his favour.\nWhy not coordinate the students into using this ability to\nexpress their views to the College? It's true Sydney does\nhave his own ideas about things and he does get a little\nupset when people disagree or dislike his ideas, doesn't everyone. But, Sydney does open himself up to suggestions\nand advice. I'm saying to you and to all the students, it's OK trying to correct the faults of the Union but it would\nbe a lot more beneficial to use the potential within the\nUnion. The students should start to use the Union and the\nsabbaticals instead of allowing College to use and abuse\nthem.\nYours sincerely,\nNeil McCluskey, Internal Services Officer Elect.\nMega-objection\nDear Judith,\nI must object to the suggestion in your mega-editorial\n(FELIX 804) that The Baron was dropped because 'it is\nthe letters page that should be used to point out\ninaccuracies'. It is clear to anyone who read the 'official'\nlast episode, printed in Broadsheet on March 21, that you\nscrapped The Baron because it ridiculed your election\nresults editorial. You rightly defend your editorial freedom\nto 'point out the mistakes, inadequacies, dod gy dealings\nand dirty tricks' of Union officers and College\nadministrators, but place yourself above this. Whether you\nare technically a Union officer or not, why should FELIX\nstaff not have the freedom to criticise you?\nThere was never any question that The Baron should\nbe scrapped while it ridiculed Ian Whygate, Derek Dash,\nChas Takeiteasy, or anyone else, but as soon as it featured\nJudith Largeamounts un favourably it was out.\nThis is the most blatant act of censorship this year.\nThe Baron was always intended to be mainly\nhumourous, whilst making caustic observations about life\nat College. It was never meant to be offensive. In reinterpreting the events of the previous week, the obvious\nsource was FELIX, otherwise most students would not\nhave understood it. I could have written about Councils\nor UGMs, but that would have made The Baron truly\nclique y, something I tried to avoid. On the day of the\nelection results FELIX the overwhelming topic of\ndiscussion was not the results themselves, but the cynical\ntreatment given to Mr Goodwin in your editorial. Hence,\nit was natural that The Baron should reflect this feeling\namong the student populace. It was not a personal attack\non you.\nIn the last issue before Easter you said that you would\nconduct a straw poll on whether the readers wanted The\nBaron or not. Was this poll every carried out? If so, what\nwere the results?\nIf The Baron is every resurrected, then I hope that the\nnext author will be able to entertain FELIX readers without\ncensorship.\nFinally, The Baron's review of the year will be available\nfor the last issue of term. Do you dare print it?\nYours, name withheld by request.\nPS. Point of information: You have not printed every\nletter that you have received this academic year.\nPPS.

    "content": "This week's FELIX may seem\nunusually big for this time of year but\nit's only because we've cheated and\ninserted the last issue of the Phoenix \u2022\ninto the middle. Due to aUG M cock\nup. no papers went up for the election\nof next year's Phoenix Editor. Liz,\nthe present Editor, is very keen to\nmeet anyone who is remotely\ninterested in working on the Phoenix\nnext year. She can be contacted via\nthe Life Science pigeonholes.\nWot no Welfare?\nI realised the other night that I needed\nto talk to somebody about my\naccommodation situation next year.\nIn the good old days I would have\ngone straight to the College Welfare\nAdviser, who would cheerily\nprovided me with answers to all my\nquestions. However, College no\nlonger has a Welfare Adviser. I rang\nup the Student Accommodation Office\nto ask if anybody there could help me\nwith my problems. They suggested\nDon Adlington. the Student\nCouncellor\u2014but it wasn't that sort of\nproblem. I didn't want to discuss my\nproblem with any old person in the\nAccommodation Office because they\ndon't have the time to listen to my\nminor queries when they're running\naround trying to house two thousand\nstudents. The Union also has no\nWelfare Officer. Welfare Officers\nhave aten dancy to get disgruntled\nwith the lack of support they receive\nfrom College and the Union and\ndecide to resign.\nA long, long, long time ago the\nWelfare Adviser used to work from\nthe Union Building but some bright\nspark moved him into Prince's Gardens and created 'Student\nServices'.\nFor four years we had the situation\nwhere Student Services (now called\nthe Student Accommodation Office)\nwas the effective landlord for 1800\nstudents and at the same time was the\nplace you had to go to if you had any\nqueries or problems with your\nlandlord. At least there was someone\nto talk to then! Now there is a void\nwhich still has to be filled, despite\nbeing highlighted in FELIX three\nweeks ago.\nIf we are going to make the Union\nmore 'user friendly' perhaps it's time\nto take back the Welfare Adviser for\nourselves and start concentrating on\nreally helping the students of\nImperial.\nThe Last Issue\nWe are currently preparing the last\nedition of FELIX, which is due to be\npublished on Wednesday 22nd June.\nIf you want to sub m if letters for this\nedition, the deadline is still Tuesday\nlunchtime the week before (14th June). Now's the time to let me know\nif you are writing a feature or an\nopinion so I can reserve you some\nspace.\nI'm very keen to receive more\nopinion articles. HG Wells is quoted\non page three this week. That was his\nopinion of Imperial College in 1934\nso what's yours in 1988?\nBound Editions\nLast year's bound editions are going\nto be picked up from the book binders\ntoday. If you've paid your deposit,\nyou can collect your edition anytime\nfrom about 4pm onwards.\nThis year's bound editions will be\nsent off at the end of July. I estimate\nthat they will cost in the region of \u00a3 3 0\nto bind. It sounds a great deal of\nmoney, but a bound edition of FELIX\nmakes excellent reading when you're\nold and grey and telling the\ngrandchildren about the good old days\nat Imperial.\nSummer T Shirts\nWe've ordered some more t shirts\nwith a wacky new summer design on\nto coincide with the last edition of\nFELIX.

    "content": "9\nA PERPLEXING\nDREAM\nIt was morning. The sun was shining\nthrough chinks in the drawn curtains,\nbright beams of sunlight were landing\non my be dc loathes. I lay in bed lazily,\nhalf asleep and half awake.\nThen I heard someone at the front\ndoor. Bobby answered it. I could hear\ntalking: then footsteps, two pairs,\nmounting the stairs up to my attic\nroom.\nThere was a knock, and my door\nswung open.\n'Here is somebody who has come\nto see you' said Bobby and he\nwithdrew.\nAt the door was a young boy of\nabout four years old. I made no\nattempt to rise from my bed because\nthe child was happy to jump on it\nimmediately he saw me.\nNeedless to say I was very charmed\nby this ingenious young visitor. He\nseemed absolutely content to play\nabout on the bed for a while; between\nthe sun beams and the shining sheets.\nI'm always good with children. They\nlike me\u2014and I like them very much\ntoo. I don't know why it is but I 've\nnoticed how a young child will almost\nimmediately start treating me like an\nolder brother.\nThis was certainly a nice way of\nstarting the morning. Now the child\nwas at the end of the bed next to my\nlegs. We looked in a friendly manner\ntowards each other.\n'So who are you?' I asked.\n'I'm playing the part of Jane Eyre,'\nhe said, obviously a little embarrassed\nat having a girl's part, even if it was\nthe title role, for his cheeks shone\nbrightly and he began to go shy.\n'Oh yes,' I said, then encouragingly\nadded 'It's very good to have such an\nimportant role. It means everybody\nlooks upon you highly, and values\nyour contribution.'\nThe child hugged my knee in a childish gesture of gratitude for my\nreassurances; and I said again how\ngood was his part. Whilst saying so\nI thought how nice it would be to\nwatch this angel of a boy in the play\nwhen it was performed.\nI slid round on the bed and upset\nthe child playfully from my knee.\n'So why have you come to tell me\nall this,' I asked with a smile.\n'Because you're playing the other\nlead role' he replied, crawling\ntowards me and being careful not to\nslip off my bed.\n'What? I'm playing the other lead\nrole?' I exclaimed in surprise. 'But\nhow coul t that be?'\n'Because you are the one who has\nwritten a play,' he replied.\n'Yes, but you see I haven't written\na play,' I began. 'Well not a proper\nplay anyway...just a small thing, a long time ago...you can't mean that\ncan you?' I was genuinely surprised.\n'So who says that I have written a play,' I finally asked.\n'Everyone,' said the child,\nwithdrawing a little. 'Everyone says\nso.'\nThe child could see that I didn't understand it.\n'Everyone says it is you who has\nwritten a play,' he repeated, this time\npleading for me to understand, and\nlooking as if he might become upset\nat any moment if I didn't. 'Oh well...that's odd,' I said at\nlength. Ile ant back on my pillow, I really couldn't understand a thing.\nThe child started crawling about\nagain, like a little beetle: Up and\ndown the folds of the white sheet, his\nsmall legs sometimes being caught in\nthe rays of the morning sun; and it\nwas nice enough for me to lie back\nand watch him. Presently I was falling\nback to sleep...but I jumped up with\na start when I realised he was crushed\nunderneath a rind of honey. I could\njust see his legs wriggling weakly. I freed him from the wax. At first he\nlay on his back and didn't move.\nThere was gooey honey caught\nbetween the segments of his body.\nThen he began to wriggle again and\ngain strength.\n'I'm sorry' I said, as if it was my\nfault, forgetting that it wasn'tI who\nhad crushed him underneath the\nhoney rind.\n'Are you alright?',\n'Yes' he said shortly.\nI said nothing more, then it\nsuddenly occurred to me that I knew\nnothing about beetles.\n'Good Lord,' I said to myself 'Here\nI am with a beetle and I don't know\nhow to look after one or anything. I don't know how heavy that rind of\nhoney seemed to the poor fellow. I don't know how long he'll live, or\nwhat he eats...\nDear, dear me...I don't know a thing.'\nI resolved to exercise great care and\nto be on the alert for all sorts of\nunexpected incidents. Then Ile ant forward on all fours in my pyjamas\nto have a closer look at him. When\nmy nose was almost touching I began\nto hear something. It was very\nsurprising. From inside him was\ncoming the broadcasting of one of\nthose taxi-cab operators. I could hear\nlots of crackling and interference, and\na voice giving instructions for a cab\nto go to Hope Street.\n'A radio,' I said aloud and got to\nmy feet and drew the curtains.\nIt was a nice looking day. I started\nto dress. Then I remembered the\nradio.\nI went over and picked it up: I tried\nto get it to make some sound again.\nThere were holes, with matches\npoking out. I tried twisting the\nmatches, or pressing their heads. I couldn't get a sound. Then I idly\nrealised it was just an empty\nmatchbox I was holding, so I cast it\naside...and I don't remember\nanything else.. .and I suppose that was\nthe end of the dream.\nAdrian Francis Wells.\n\n"

The animosity, the immaturity and above all the\npettiness do not befit those who have been elected to\npositions of responsibility in the student body of a renowned academic institution. Let us leave such\nbehaviour to the likes of Ronald Reagan and 'The Sun'\nand show ourselves to be worthy of greater respect. The\nability to rise above the level of personal bickering and\nconduct truly objective arguments is a rare but highly\ndesirable quality. We are perhaps influenced too much\nthese days by advertising and party politics (a rather\ncynical form of advertising) to realise that the most\nconvincing disputant is the one who acknowledges the\nother's point of view, whilst still believing theirs is more\nvalid. Maybe we suffer from a lack of History and Law\nstudents but scientists should themselves know more than\na little about 'truth' and the deduction of 'facts' from\nevidence.\nAt the start of the year my dealings with both FELIX\nand the Union, mainly in connection with the Music Room\nsaga, left me with a positive impression of competent\npeople doing a good job. Now it seems that the obsession\nof both parties with a personal dispute has left them blind\nto their own faults and incapable of clear judgement.\nYours disgruntled,\nAlan Downie.\nI totally agree with everything you have written. I also\nregret that everything has been so 'personal' this term.\nI don't believe that it has ^clouded my editorial\njudgement. My only obsession is to produce the best\nFELIX possible each week. ^ ^^te^\nYa, boo, sucks!\nDear Judith,\nIt is with regret that I must write to complain about the\ncontent of last week's FELIX. I refer, of course, to the\nletters page, notably the two by Mr Neil McCluskey and\nMr David Clements.\nMr McCluskey: I'm not aware of any anonymous\ncontributions I 've made to FELIX, short of the odd small\nad. If you do know of any, however, please don't hesitate\nto contact me, either via 'UGM Chairman 88/89, Union\nOffice' or 'Editor's Floozie, FELIX Office'.\nThe reason I quoted from Council is because it was both\ncurrent and topical. If I had to wait for the production\nof minutes, then I'd be waiting till eternity.\nI do not doubt Mr Bridge's( name changed in aid of\nComic Relief) enthusiasm for one moment, however\nmisguided it may be. What I object to, is the way he\npersuaded Council to adopt a particular view by feeding\nthem half-truths and half-baked logic.\nOne final note: Charisma is a rare quality and a term\nthat should be used sparingly. I do not feel that a President\nwho alienates 99% of the student population possesses such\na gift.\nMr Clements: Item one: As mentioned by Judith last\nweek, Mr Bridge made no objection to the amount of social\ncolours awarded when they were originally brought before\nPublications Board\u2014a meeting he was present at. His\nobjection was only made at Council when he saw who\nhad received colours. As I mentioned in my original letter,\nthis list included those who had been critical of The Bridge\nin the past year. This is where I believe the deception lies\n(sic).\nPoint of information: Less social colours were awarded\nby Publications Board this year than in any year since\n1984.\nItem two: You miss the point. Council decided to add\nnot only preparing papers to Council/UGM Chair but also\nupdating policy. This is a decision that was previously\nthrown out by a UGM\u2014a higher body than Council.\nRequest for information: What right has a Counciltotal maximum membership 50\u2014got to alter a decision\nmade by a UGM\u2014total maximum membership of 5000?\nThe main point of both your letters, I gather, is to point\nout that a majority decision made at Council means that\nit is a correct one. Question: How can Council members\npossibly vote on a motion if they are not presented with\nthe full facts and are told pork ies by the Union President\nand/or his minions? The expression 'blind faith' springs\nto mind.\nOh and Sydney, remember the Tacoma Bridge...\nCheers, Paul Shanley/Shan the Man/Judith's Floozie.\nP.S. Which is better-Jacket?\n-to be Judith's floozie or Zev-Green\nLegal eagle\nDear Judith,\nI have always been reluctant to criticise FELIX because,\non the whole, it is extremely good. 'Blackmail', however,\nhas become so unpleasant recently that I feel I must write.\nFirstly, 'Delator' is breaking the law in threatening to\npublish names if money is not received. Section 31 of the\nLarceny Act, 1916 states that it is an offence (punishable\nby up to two years in prison) to: 'Threaten to publish,\nor propose to abstain from publishing libellous or other\nmatter with intent to extort.'\nIf Delator's allegations are true then FELIX would\ncertainly have a defence against Libel but not (it would\nappear) against blackmail!\nSecondly, I am concerned as to the accuracy of the\ninformation 'Delator' receives. Generally such information\nwould be second or third-hand and difficult to check. I cannot see what is to stop unscrupulous people\nanonymously using this column to get at those they dislike.\nLastly, I strongly object to 'Chris Jones' smarmy\napology on page five of last week's edition. (In case\nanyone still doesn't know, Chris Jones is a pseudonym.)\nEven if the allegations about Mr Motteram were true\n(which I doubt) FELIX has still broken the law on\nblackmail, as described above. If the allegations are\ninaccurate then FELIX has libelled Mr Motteram as well!\n'The 'apology' published by 'Chris Jones' was thus as\nunwise as it was unpleasant to read.\nI have asked several students for their view on\n'Blackmail'. The overwhelming feeling was that 'The\nBaron' had been much better. Please could we see his\nreturn in place of 'Blackmail'?\nYours sincerely,\nNigel Stokes.\nThanks for pointing it out, Nigel. I have decided to drop\ni Blackmail for the time being for the reasons you state\nThe Baron will be appearing in the last issue\nFELIX Friday 3rd June 1988 ii "

    "content": "SOMETHING BREAKING\nI look outside. The sun is shining\nbrightly; I feel its warmth on my\nback, an invitation to enjoy life. The\nheat is rendered bearable by an\noccasional light gust of wind, and the\nref e shing coolness of the grass. I am\nsitting on the edge of a cliff. Below\nme, sea d birds whirl and dive and\nclimb on unseen currents of air, their\ncries all but drowned out by the\nrumble of the angry deep blue sea\nbattering against the rocks. At the\nbase of the cliff the waves are flecked\nwith white foam; further out the swell\nis unnoticeable. and the water is just\na uniform carpet of blue-green. Near\nthe horizon two yachts are sailing. At\nthis distance only their sails are\nvisible.. .fleetingly I wonder what the\npeople on board them are doing at this\nmoment...what they are saying,\nthinking...\nThe sky is an immense ceiling of\nazure blue; in it, the sun stands alone.\nThe clouds have fled elsewhere. The\ngrass around me has been cropped\nshort by rabbits. It appears lifeless,\nbut behind me grasshoppers chirp\noccasionally, and further off a lark\nsings. The day is serene; everything\nwelcomes me. Nature beckons to me,\ninviting me to become a part of it.\nThat I cannot do...I do not belong\nhere, with this grass, with this sea,\nwith this sky. My ancestors shunned\nnature many ages ago, creating an\nartificial world of houses and streets\nand shops...that is where I belong,\nwith my fellow people. If I had a choice, I would turn away from them,\nand become a part of nature. Because\nnature makes no judgements; nature\naccepts things, beings, as they are...it\nscorns nothing and no one. Nature\nwelcomes anything that choses to\nfollow nature's way. If I had a choice;\nthe decision has already been taken\nfor me.\nI am sitting on a cliff top. The\ngeographical location doesn't matter...it could be Cuba, New\nZealand, Canada, Easter Island or the\nUK... it's just a cliff top like any other\nin the world. And I don't belong\nthere.\nI look inside. There is turmoil; inside\nme everything is twisted up.. .it's been\nlike this a long time and it hurts. I feel\nlike an outcast inside. If I go back to\nthe place I call home, no one will\nnotice I am back because no one will\nhave noticed my absence. I know\npeople, but they do not know me. I have friends, but they would not call\nme their friend. Nobody cares for me;\nnobody cares about me; nobody\nrecognises me. When I am with\npeople I feel invisible, because no one\nsees me. All I want is to be accepted\nby the society I was created by...and\neven if that is not possible, then at\nleast let me know why I am not\nacceptable. For I see no difference\nbetween myself and other people; yet\nother people are accepted, and I am\nbut tolerated.. .1 am a stranger to my\nown kin. I ask myself why. The\nquestion burns deep inside me like a fiery coal, night and day, causing an\naching pain that grows and grows\nuntil only tears can extinguish it.. .for\na while. I watch other people talking,\nlaughing, and I am jealous. What I say does not interest them; when I laugh I can only laugh at my s lef. I am\nan island in a sea of despair. My life\nis a desert visited only by the harsh\nwinds of the thoughts in my mind.\nMy world lies in the direction of the\nsun that beats do ww on my back. It\nis a world of people. It is a society\nof which I am not a part. It refuses\nto acknowledge me. I don't belong\nthere.\nI look down. The gun rests in my\nhand. It is heavy, smooth, and warm\nin the heat of the day. It feels like a friend...something that will do me a favour...something that will selflessly\ngive a part of itself to help me in my\npredicament.\nThere is more to life than just\nstaying alive. Life must have a context; if life and environment are\nnot in harmony then the life is futile,\na simple squandering of resources that\ncould better be used by others, or an\ninterminable journey with no goal in\nsight. My life is out of context with\nmy world.\nThis is not the first time I have\ncome to the cliff. Many times before,\nwith the pain welling up inside, I have\ncome to this place to seek the reason.\nSometimes in the face of harsh winter\ngales, carrying the sting of salt spray;\nsometimes in the quiet of night, with\nonly the moon as a witness. The cliff\nis a lonely place, always providing me\nwith the solace I needed to decide that\nI could give my world one more try.\nAnd so I would stare out to sea for\na long time, and then wend my way\nback down the path to the town. But\nnot this time. This time, something\nis different; something, that would\npreviously stretch but then relax, is\nbreaking, about to snap. Inside, the\nfires of loneliness have almost\nconsumed me now, leaving the shell\nwith no desire to live.\nI am more at home on the lonely\ncliff top than I am with the few people\nI see in the town. But if I live, I have\nno option but to live in the town, in\nthe world that I am supposed to be a part of. If I live.\nI close my eyes. The gun, my only\ntrue friend, lightly touches my\ntemple. I feel happier than I have ever\nfelt before. Inside me, something has\nbroken.\nJ.D. "

In the first round, the third\npairing of Hideo Takano and Chris\nTomdgidi did well to force a draw\nagainst the UCL thirds. After a spirited first set, the second pairing\nof Peter Hunt and Dhnusha De\nLanerolle lost to the formidable UCL second pair, and the first pairing of\nKen Cheung and Roy Harrison were\ndisappointed with a draw against the\nUCL first pair. In the second round\nour second pair beat the UCL third\npair as did our first pair in the final\nround also in the last round the second\npair did well to force a draw with the\nUCL firsts. So, after three and a half\nhours of tennis under blistering heat,\nwe had another whole match to play\nwhich we had to win.\nCareful pacing and plenty of liquid\nintake ensured that we all felt capable\nof lasting the day. Essex had had an\nafternoon's rest but were a fairly\nweak team and after the second\nround, Cheung and Harrison were\nheading for a clean sweep with De\nLanerolle and Hunt unbeaten, but it\nwas 8 o 'clock in the evening and\nEssex decided to give up.\nConsequently UCL and IC went\nforward to the last sixteen of the U AU 'Junior' Competition.

    "content": "Editorial:\nJudging science\nLast week the Department of Geology\nreconciled itself to its downgrading by\nthe UGC. The Department will, in\nfuture, get less money and will not be\nexpected (or funded) to do a broad\nrange of research. The Department\nwill fight for more money by asking\nits industrial sponsors to make up its\nlosses, but there is no guarantee that\nthis will save the day. The supposed\nreasons for the UGC's decision are\nworth looking at since they raise\nimportant issues about the way\nscience is done. Other subject areas\nare now under review and the\ndecisions made about them may affect\nall the departments at Imperial\nCollege.\nPublication counting\nThe primary rationale for the UGC's reorganisation seems to be related to\nthe Department's publication record.\nIn their review of research excellence,\nthe UGC asked departments to\nnominate a handful of their best\npublications in the previous few\nyears. The poor geologists only came\nout of that review with an average\ngrade, so the UGC was out to get\nthem even before the country wide review of all geology departments.\nWhen the full review was started a slightly more rational assessment was\nmade of departmental research\nexpertise based on overall publication\nrecord. Unfortunately the geologists\nstill looked fairly average.\nAnother failure of the Department\n(in the eyes of the UGC) was its\napparent lack of cooperation with\nother departments. However, what\nthey actually meant by this was\ncooperation with other Science\ndepartments such as Chemistry or\nPhysics. The geologists have very\ngood relationships with the other\ndepartments in the Mines building,\nbut the UGC was, apparently, not\nvery interested in this.\nI will come back to the issue of\ninter-departmental cooperation later,\nbut, first, it is worth looking at the\nusefulness of publication records as\nan indicator of scientific worth.\nThe geologists have complained\nthat their publication record is but a UNDER\\ THE MICROSCOPE\nby Steve Black\npale reflection of their true scientific\nworth because they do a lot of\n(unpublished) consult a a cy work for\nindustry. Indeed, industry is supposed\nto think very highly of the department\n(though how much money they will\nbe prepared to contribute is another\nissue). It could be argued that if the\ndepartment is that useful to industry\nthen it ought to get its money from\nindustry and not the UGC.\nHowever, the more important point\nis that sheer number of publications\nis a terrible guide to scientific merit.\nSome assessors prefer to use weight\nof publications since this takes fair\naccount of long papers, but most\nofficial statistics just count numbers.\nThis drives scientists to cut all their\nwork down to the minimum\npublishable size (unfortunately this is\nusually well below the minimum\nscientifically useful size). It makes\nlittle sense to publish a long coherent\nand well argued piece of work after\nseveral years, when you could publish\nit in fragmented d ribs and drabs and\nget four times as many brownie points\nwith your paymasters. Also, rapidly\nto publish a poorly thought out bit of\nwork and to later have to publish a retraction, is twice as good for your\npublications rate as taking your time\nto get it right in the first place. In\neffect the UGC's criteria for\nmeasuring scientific excellence and\nencouraging just the reverse: an\nexplosion of scientific hot air designed\nto impress the bosses rather than to\npush back the frontiers of science.\nIf we do have to judge scientists and\ndepartments, then we should look for\nmore objective measures of their\nquality. The Institute For Scientific\nInformation (ISI for short) publishes\nan index of scientific citations. Using\nthe index you can count how many\npeople read your publications (since\nthey will put references to it in their\npapers). So if a department only\npublishes a few papers each year, but\nthey are all classics of their field (and\neveryone else cites them in their\nwork), then the department's citation\nindex will be good despite an\napparently poor publication record.\nAlso, your citation record cannot be\nimproved by publishing vast amounts\nof garbage, since other scientists will\nnot refer to dud work no matter how\nmuch of it you produce.\nCitation Indexing is not perfect. It\nis, for example, biased against very\nnew areas of science that have not yet\nbecome popular. It will also miss\nconsultancy work for industry.\nConversely, it gives a high rating to\nwork in trendy areas whether or not\nit has any real significance or\nimportance. However, despite its\nproblems citation indexing has been\nsuccessful at some things: it is fairly\ngood at predicting Nobel Prizes, for\nexample. Of all the 'objective'\nmethods we have to assess scientific\nquality, citation indexing is the best\nand the one which causes least\ndistorting of the scientific enterprise.\nConstituent Colleges\nand the failure to\ncooperate\nWhether the geologists would have\ndone any better under citation\ncounting is difficult to say, but the\npowers that be would clearly have\nlooked more favourably on them if\ntheir record of cooperation with other\ndepartments was better.\nUnfortunately their bad record on this\nis not their fault: it is inherent in the\nway Imperial College is structured.\nThe historic division of the College\ninto three segments my be loved by\nthe (handful) of CCU activists, but it\nperpetuates an illogical separation of\nsimilar departments and it gets in the\nway of inter-departmental\ncooperation.\nTake the departments of Chemistry,\nChemical Engineering and Material\nScience: there are good historical\nreasons for their present place in the\nCollege structure (RCS, C&G and\nRSM respectively), but in any other\nuniversity the overlapping areas\nwould have been rational is eda long\ntime ago. As it is their cooperation\nacross the constituent college\nboundaries is almost non-existent. So,\nthere is substantial overlap in terms\nof research interests but little actual\ncooperation. Good management\nwould have sorted out this problem\nlong ago, but British academics are\nnotoriously conservative. They seem\nto resist change until it is forced upon\nthem and this only makes the whole\nprocess more painful.\nThe poor geologists suffer from the\nsame problem: they cooperate well\nwith the other RSM departments, but\nthey hardly talk to the scientists or the\nengineers. The anachronism of our\ntripartite constituent college system\nhas now cost us a considerable\namount of UGC money. When the\nUGC start to look at our other\ndepartments, the same thing may\nhappen again. Three constituent\ncolleges may give some people a good\nsocial life, but it's a stupid way to run\na university.\nManaging universities\nThe basic problem with British\nuniversities is that they have never\nhad to be well managed. The\nGovernment has (until recently) been\ngenerous enough to academia for the\nuniversities to do what they want\nwithout having to be well organised.\nNow, with the Thatcher squeeze, they\nare having to make hard decisions\nabout the allocations of resources:\nthey will soon have to be well\norganised to get anything done.\nPeople in industry have to be well\norganised: badly run companies go\nbankrupt. Universities have not been\nforced to live with such a harsh\nselective pressure: they usually\nsurvive whether or not they are\ninefficient, wasteful or badly\norganised.\nIf the universities are going to\nsurvive Thatcher, they will have to\nstart learning how to manage. So they\neither have to teach academics the art\nof organisation or they have to attract\ntop managers from successful\nindustries to run their departments.\nThat wouldn't be such a bad idea\nsince managers are well equipped to\nmake objective judgments about the\nrelative merits of academics' work\n(whereas academics can be just a bit\nbitchy about the merits of their rivals'\nresearch).\nThe sooner we get our act together\nthe less painful it will be in the long\nterm. We can't buck Thatcher\nforever.\nFriday 3rd June 1988 FELIX\n\n"

'We can design and build aa\nindividual for a particular job. instead\nof relying on the hazards or biological\nchance like you primitive Earthlings.\n\"We do not waste energy and time on\nsex and love as you obsessed people\ndo.\"\n'It's not a waste of time!' Premium\nprotested vigorously. 'It's great fun.\nAnd with your mechanical lives you\nmiss the fascination of individual\ndevelopment from babyhood to youth\nand maturity. You miss the superb\nvariety of unplanned human\npersonality and appearance. How can\nyou do without love, the centre piece of my existence?'\nE3 answered her gently.\n'We avoid its pains as well as its\npleasures. We were organic like you,\nmillions of years ago, but that is\nfragile, unreliable and unstable\u2014no\nbasis for prolonged survival. By\nbecoming electro-mechanical we\nbecame masters of ourselves and of\nthe Universe.\"\nPremium thought how dead they all\nlooked, with no breathing, no\nfid getting. no moving lips when\nsound emerged from the invisible\nloudspeakers. With eyes in six\ndirections, they did not even turn their\nheads to look when another alien\nspoke. Only their eye units swivelled\noccasionally, and she was still a little\nunnerved to have so many eyes\ntrained on her from different angles.\nShe re crossed her legs, smoothed\ndown her skirt, the continued her\nquestioning.\n'You still have not told me the\npurpose of your mission,\" she\nreminded them sternly.\n'I was coming to that when you\ninterrupted me,' said Al, moving a little closer on his multi-jointed legs,\nin our enormously long history, we\nhave learned to succeed materially.\nWe have philosophy to give us\njudgement, but philosophy is sterile:\nit is analytical and destructive, rather\nthan constructive. Always we have\nfelt that something was lacking from\nour existence, some higher purpose.\nOr some aspect of being which cannot\nbe reduced to equations and sub-molecular particles.'\ni knew it!' exclaimed Premium.\n'You lack a soul. That's obvious from\nyour attitude to love.\"\n'Yes. We lack a soul.\" agreed Al, as his companions at last moved their\nheads in agitation.\nH7 spoke for the first time.\n'We had great difficulty in\nmonitoring your broadcasts as we\ncame through space. Our radar\nstealth-shield interferes to some\nextent, but the main problem is this:\nAs the Earth spins on its axis, so the\nTV signals beamed up your\ngeostationary relay satellites also\nrotate in space, so we only caught a tiny fraction of each programme. And\nvery few of those programmes\nmentioned souls.'\n'What is worse,' interrupted B5,\n'your multiplicity of to un gue s and\ndialects confused our language\ndecipher ment computers for a long\ntime. Normally on a planet, a dominant language eventually\nextinguishes all others. Yet we learnt\non landing yesterday that a single TV\nwavelength from London carries\nprogrammes in English. Welsh,\nFrench, Gujerate, Bengali and Urdu!'\nA2 now continued: 'Not only was\nthere the intermittent signal problem\nand the different languages, but you\neven seem to have different religions\nco-existing, with quite different views\nabout God and the soul. There was\none American religious broadcast\nwhich we were able to analyse in\ndetail two days ago, with a fairly\nsimple message. It told us about .\nChrist's second coming, and about the\nprofits. When we first monitored you\nin the crowd, we hoped that your\nstrange white headdress indicated a head nun, or a high priestess of\nreligion. We would like you to bring\neach of us a soul, if you can obtain\nthem.\"\n'That is our purpose,' agreed Al. 'Give us a soul, and we will leave\nyour planet in peace.\"\nUsing all her powers of self-control, Premium just managed to\nsuppress an outburst of laughter at\nbeing mistaken for a head nun. She\nthought deeply for a while, bent over\nin the glass chair, then sat up straight.\n'Your stay here is causing great\nworry and disruption of everyday\nlife,\" she admonished. 'The people\nfeel afraid in the presence of such\nsuperior beings and such advanced\ntechnology. At his first coming,\nChrist did not seem a threat to the\nhumans around him. He was born of\na woman; he looked like the people\nand seemed humble, sharing their\ntroubles. Your spaceship seems alien\nand hostile.\nT will make a bargain with you. I will take me a day to accomplish what\nyou want, but tomorrow I will bring\nyou five of the best souls available.\nIn return, I ask that you leave as soon\nas you receive them. You must also\ntake off without harming anything.\nYou must un convert those religious\nzombies, too. I should warn you that\nany attempts to examine the souls I bring could easily damage or destroy\nthem\u2014just reverently put them in\nyour heads, un analysed. They will not\nall look alike, as they are very\nindividual. They will not harm or\nattack you.'\nAl advanced smoothly to within a yard of Single 0-1 's chair. 'We are\nnot used to hearing inferior beings\ntelling us what we must do, but we\nare desperate for souls, your terms\nseem fair, and we think that you are\nhonest. H7 will prepare a de-conversion tape for our recruits whom\nwe shall no longer need after take-off.\nIf we had required them for military\npurposes against your armies, you\nwould have found them supermen and\nsuper women, not zombies, once\nactivated by our signal.\n'As for our take-off tomorrow, we\nwill use our anti-gravity shield, so\nthere will be no radiation or flame\nhazard, though you should keep\neveryone well clear. You should stop\nthe tube system below and empty the\nunderground car parks near here.\nDoes that satisfy you?'\n'Almost,' Premium answered.\nShe stood up, put her mouth near\nhis head and whispered briefly.\nAl drew back sharply, then\nstopped. After a moment's though, he\nsaid: 'Why not? It sounds harmless\nenough. So we will see you\ntomorrow, Premium, without fail.\nWe shall not see you again after that\nas we are planning the difficult\ntransition to a new and better\nUniverse, but the souls you bring will\ngive us fresh confidence for such a task. You can leave now, by the way\nyou came up.'\nAfter Premium's brief visit to the\nspaceship the next day, she waited\nwith L in the crowd to watch the\nexpected take-off. Knowing that the\naliens would be watching her\nespecially, single 0-1 waved and blew\na kiss as the tall metal cylinder began\nto rise. Perhaps they might even\nreplay the film one day she thought.\nSoon the spaceship had completely\ndisappeared from sight, ending its\nmonitoring of the crowd.\nThus on the third day of their\nmission to Earth, the visitors from\nspace departed as promised. They\nascended into the heavens almost\nnoiselessly, except for a great rushing\nwind.\n'Mission accomplished L,' said\nPremium wearily. A tear spilled down\nher cheek. 'You know, I was growing\nquite fond of the simple-minded\naliens.\"\n'Don't tell me that you made love\nto them just now?\" her boss asked\nsharply.\n'No\u2014but I did kiss them all, by\nmutual agreement. The first aliens\nI 've ever kissed. And dear old Al even pinched my bottom!\"\n'What did you take them in that\nstainless steel casket, Premium? The\nPrime Minister and I were furious that\nyou wouldn't take us into your\nconfidence yesterday. We have to\nreport immediately to the PM's Office\nfor debriefing. But why are you\nlaughing now, single 0-1?'\nPremium was giggling almost too\nmuch to answer.\ni was just imagining those poor\ndeluded aliens solemnly sitting in\ntheir spacecraft with their souls\nstuffed into their brains! 'is so funny!'\n'Kindly explain to this less\nperceptive mortal just what bargain\nyou struck yesterday with th os all-powerful aliens, with absolutely no\nauthorisation from me or the PM?'\n'That's easy,' Premium replied.'\n'You remember the miracle of the\nleaves and fishes, and my little lecture\non homonyms? Well, I gambled on\nth os much too logical aliens still not\nhaving solved the problem of our\nillogical language. I'm sure that A2\nsaid profits, not prophets, yesterday.\nThey wanted souls, so I gave them\nsouls\u2014or at least soles, as that is what\nI actually promised.'\n'Premium\u2014you didn't \u2014you don't mean...'\n'Yes, L. That casket I delivered\nthirty minutes ago contained three of\nthe best flat fish and two expensive\nleather stick-on soles. And they just\nstuffed them into their brains as I watched! Isn't that priceless?'\nL turned even more scarlet.\n'So you mean that you gambled the\nentire safety o of this planet on a stupid\npun, Premium?'\n'Well, it worked,\" said the\nunrepentant secret agent, 'They\ndeparted happily for a better\nUniverse, and I'm still enjoying this\none. Let's take that taxi over there to\nDowning Street. If the PM's private\nsecretary can make one, I could do\nwith a stiff bloody Margaret!'\nDr Bernard Lamb.\n\n"

    "content": "TWO DAYS\nIN THE LIFE\nThe story starts on a Saturday\nmorning, and it starts badly, as for\nonce my body clock failed me, and\nI didn't wake until almost eleven\u2014\ndisgracefully late. This, and the recent\ndemise of an affair of the heart which \u2022\nhad been inconclusive from day one\nleft me bleary, and rather depressed,\nso after breakfast I decided to go to\nCamden Market to cheer myself up,\nand for the sake of the exercise I decided to walk from Fulham. As an\nadditional pick-me-up, I put on my\nnew leather jacket and black 501s, as\ndressing in glad rags usually helps my\nmoods.\nAll went well until somewhere near\nthe top of Oxford Street, when my\nmind wandered and my feet followed\nit\u2014I wound up in the Aldwych on the\nsteps of St Clement Danes. This part\nof the City is very quiet and lonely\non a Saturday afternoon, and did my\nmood no good at all; I couldn't help\nthinking of the unfortunate Dane who\ngot nailed to the door of the then St\nClements. I expect he didn't like the\nAldwych either.\nWith the directions of a passing\ncopper I found Camden, and went for\na wander, finally ending up in the\nZipper store on the high street where\nI spent too much money on a rather\nnice tee-shirt with a very sexy man\non it, and the message, T can resist\nanything except temptation'. Then\nbegan the sequence of events which\nled to my downfall. I remembered a friend I hadn't seen for a long time\nwho lived close by, and decided to\npay him a visit. He was pleased to see\nme, and after a few drinks he and his\nboyfriend asked me out for the night.\nThe booze made me careless\u2014I agreed.\nThe evening started well. We did\nthe rounds of the gay pubs in\nCamden, and towards eleven we\nheaded into the West End, and to a club called Napoleon's. This is very\nexclusive, and very expensive\u2014it is\nthe place where well heeled, middle\naged City Queens go to drink the\nnight away. Being the youngest man\nin a gay club is rather ex hi le rating, and oh boy did I live it up. I danced\nlike a dervish until 2am, drank\nenough to rupture my liver, and got\nchatted up by the pianist, an engaging\nman in his thirties who called me\nDarling.\nI finally left Napoleon's at about\n2.30, woozy and alone, and set\nmyself to walk back to Fulham. My\nmemory is perfect until I reached\nSouth Kensington, but after that there\nis a blank, at the end of which\u2014to my\nutter self-disgust\u2014I woke up at\n4.30am in a strange bed with someone\nI didn't know, and had to ask him the\nworst question of all: 'What's your\nname?'.\nI got home at dawn, still drunk and\nfeeling physically and mentally\nsoiled, had a bath and went to bed.\nMy body clock has an odd sense of\nhumour\u2014it woke me punctually at\n6.30. Sober at last, but completely\nashamed of myself, I dressed and\nwalked up to Hyde Park, and spent\nthe morning smoking and watching\nthe geese on the Long Water. It was\nearly in the afternoon when I got up\nto leave, still feeling lousy. I turned\ntoward the Albert Hall, and saw\nsomething which stopped me in my\ntracks, and made me forget all my\ntroubles as if they had never existed.\nIn front of me stood an old man,\nshabbily dressed. He could only\nmumble at the passes by, and my\nheart went out to him, living in his\nlonely world for one. As I watched,\nhe extended his arms above his head,\nand spread his fingers apart, giving\nan odd little chirruping whistle, and\nto my complete astonishment\nsparrows started to appear and perch\non his hands, first by ones and twos,\nand then in tens, until he looked like\na large impression of a scarecrow. A small group of people gathered to\nwatch him, at first completely silent\nuntil a little boy gave a gurgling\nlaugh, and clapped his hands in\nadmiration. The old man turned his\nface to us, a king crowned with\nsparrows, and slowly broke into such\na gentle, happy smile that it made you\ngrin to see him.\nEven in the lowest days of my life\nto come, I know I will remember that\nmoment. I don't think I can ever be\ndepressed again without seeing the\nvision in my head of the old King of\nthe Birds, and the little boy that\nlaughed.\nWINDOW SHOPPING\nManikin model\u2014positioned perversity,\nmanikin model\u2014ecstatically nude.\nManikin model\u2014er otis m suggested,\nmanikin model\u2014immodest extrude.\nPlastic thrift.\nClothes grafted;\nsenses censored\u2014\nshapely soulless nothings\ncreated and destroyed\nat inforced public taste's demands.\nManikin model\u2014serene sociology,\nmanikin model\u2014painlessly posed.\nManikin model\u2014society's acceptance,\nmanikin model\u2014painfully closed.\nExpressionful pout\nBreasts moulded\nLimbs joint less \u2014\nshapely soulless nothings\nsparsely clad in merchandise\nas inforced fasion markets demand.\nManikin model\u2014supreme sensuality,\nmanikin model\u2014silently burn.\nManikin model\u2014arsonist's daydream,\nmanikin model\u2014murderer's yearn\nMolten plastic\nJewellery stained\nClothes charred-shapely soulless nothings\nbeauty in nih al ation as inforced madman's will demands.\nT.H.

    "content": "4\nThe teachers were the same as ever.\nPerhaps slightly greyer, and more\ntired looking, more furrows on the\nbrow, but bearing welcoming smiles\nand being sure to remember\neveryone's name. 'How are you;\nStephanie?' How's it going, Melissa?'\nThey proffered glasses of wine on\ntrays. This recognition of our passage\ninto adulthood, since leaving school\nthree years ago, concerned us.\nAlcohol was not a thing associated\nwith school common-rooms, except\nunder giggly secrecy at end-of-term\nparties, and the notion of the teachers\nactually condoning our alcohol\nconsumption was a curious one.\nNeedless to say, we didn't refuse, sat\nback on the fading, jaded Habitat\nfurniture, so pristine and new in our\nmemories, and, sipping wine and\nmunching sausage rolls, observed the\nfriends and enemies of bygone days.\n'There's Fiona, Doesn't she look a sight?'\nT wonder if RosalindTl turn up?'\nT think Danielle looks nice. I wish\nmy hair would go like that.'\n'Corinne hasn't changed\u2014just as\nt arty as ever.'\n'Do you think Andrea'll come with\nthe baby?'\nThe arrival of a teacher, smiling\ningratiatingly and hovering\napologetically as if not wishing to\nintrude, yet desperately desirous of\nour conversation, forced us to break\nthe knot of sharp cynical observation.\nWe exchanged pleasantries, yes, yes,\nwe'd loved being at university, well,\nyes, we were sad to leave, no, we\nwere glad we were not continuing\nwith postgraduate studies\u2014and then,\nwell, it had to come, the dreaded\nQuestion\u2014what were we going to do\nnow?\nKate piped up first. It was fairly\neasy for her. 'I'm having a year out\nand going to Australia,' she said. 'I'm saving up for my air fare.' This was\na lie from the start. No doubt she\nwould accrue about fifty pounds, the\nrest to be paid by her father. 'I 'll get\na job when I get there, and I 've got\nsome relatives in Melbourne...' She\nchattered away happily and we seized\nadvantage of this to move away from\nthe kind yet inquisitive approaches of\nanother staff member.\nThey were all there, the tall, the\nshort, the thin, the fat, the pretty and\nthe ugly, in the same cliques as ever.\nI suppose we were just the same, but\nwhereas the others held court in the\ncentre of the room, we clung to the\nwalls, content merely to observe\nbefore we in turn had to be observed.\nThey all had their futures mapped out,\nthis great clan of smartly-dressed,\npearl-beaded young ladies, with their\nstriped shirt collars upturned,\nTHE QUESTION\nperching on the edge of their seats,\nignoring all the free food and drink\nthat was the prime reason for our\npresence. 'Sindy dolls'\u2014that was\nwhat we used to calf them, and I despised them still, with their\nexcessively pretty names\u2014Lucinda,\nAnne-Marie, Corelia, Francesca,\nYvette\u2014and their silly, affected\nmanners\u2014'Jo-Jo! How nice to see\nyou!' and lots of hugging and\nembracing. The fact that Jo-Jo and\nLu-Lu were bosom companions and\nhad probably seen each other virtually\nevery day since the end of term was\nirrelevant. But their futures were\ncertain\u2014they had chosen sensible\ndegree courses, and were to be\ndentists, lawyers, physiotherapists,\neconomists. They knew how to\nanswer that dreaded Question.\nThere were others, of course, but\nthey weren't here, most of them. The\n'failures' and rejects, the office-girls\nand shop assistants, Liz who worked\nin a printer's, Louise who was a cook\nin the Army, Pauline w worked\nalternately in a pub and c hippy on the seafront, and, of course,\nAndrea with the baby.\nThey couldn't satisfactorily answer\nthe Question, so they hadn't come.\nBut, to the school, they were failures,\nthey hadn't gone into higher\neducation, or, if they had, they had\ndropped out. We' weren't failures,\nwe'd got our degrees\u2014but what else?\nWe couldn't answer the Question.\nWhat would we do with our lives? At\nleast most of the 'failures' drove\nsmart cars and could afford to go out\nmost nights.\n'Of course, some of the people here\nmust be lesbians, you know.'\n'Well\u2014girls. According to the\nnational average, there should be\nthree lesbians from our year.'\n'Three?'\n'How do you know?'\nWe'd never really considered this\npossibility before. Of course, there\nwas the Home Economics teacher\nwho shared a country cottage with the\nGames mistress; our adolescent minds\nhad concluded that homosexuality\nwas therefore rife in their household,\nand th t the Games mistress, who\nmade us run once round the hockey\nHIGH COUNTRY\nThe wind has teeth\nAnd in its bite I feel my folly\nAhead, far in the cloaking mist,\nFar, as my faint heart tells me,\nThe hill men go;\nThat special lucky breed\nAs if by right race up\nForbidden crags, and little dream\nThat some\nFeel every step a privilege\nAnd every clawing hold\nA prize hard earned\nAnd proudly count each\nSmall horizon won.\nAnd yet we have something\nIn common\u2014the high country\nCalls, like the fatal siren\nHiding her peril with her charms.\nIn truth the hills lack\nAll the lushness, the easy\nGrace of sweet fields rolling\nTame from town to town.\nSteep crags, they show; proud rock\nThat dares the solitary fool\nTo try his strength.\nAnd deep within me that\nStrong lure strikes strong response\nSo that some crazy part\nOf me cries out 'Go on,' though\nMuscles creak, and sane mind fears\nOblivion. But on the peaks\nWith frozen flesh but heart\nFlushed warm with selfless love,\nI think back to the city's Press of people and I know\nThat what I have to fear is not\nThe high ground, but the low\nKeya Schmiechen.\nfield for every item of kit we left\nbehind, obviously 'wore the trousers'.\nThe possibility that two spinsters\nmight share a beautiful residence for\ncompanionship and sound economic\nsense simply did not interest us.\nBut the idea that some of our\ncontemporaries could be was a new\none. Would it interfere with their\ncareer prospects? Was there anything\nabout it in the Hippocratic Oath?\nWhat if a prospective client found\nout?\nIt didn't matter to us, anyway. The\ndesultory conversation and snide\nspeculation were fun, but the ultimate\noutcome was the same. They could\nanswer the Question\u2014some were\ncurrently doing so, smiling prettily,\npreening their hair, digging their heels\ninto the carpet and chatting politely\u2014\nand we couldn't. This wasn't our\nscene. We decided to leave. Hastily\nconsuming a last pizza square, we\ndelved beneath a mountain of green\nwaxed 'Country Jackets' for our\ncoats, said the goodbyes... .then went\ndown the pub.\nMadeline Slatford\n\n"

Whenever danger\nthreatened, the coveted single 0-1\nprefix licensed her to kiss for her\ncountry's honour!\n'Not really.' said Premium.

That\nRed Rostov\u2014the randy Russian\nbear\u2014caught me a dreadful clout\nacross the ear with his claws before\n1 killed him. I smothered him with\nRaisa's best fur coat!

And they're\nquite irrational. By the way, did you\norder the usual res or at ive on arrival?\nGood. Ah yes. do come, in Mr\nCashpound. That's right, two blue-blooded Margarets. That will be all,\nthank you.'\nL picked up a large tumbler for\nherself and gave Premium the other.\n'How well the Parfiat d 'Amour\ngoes with gin,' said L, relaxing for\na moment. 'And such a pretty\nmauve y blue colour\u2014it matches your\neyes, Premium. Now, what have you\nheard of our latest troubles?'\n'With these bandages, hardly\nanything. But I got the RAF boys at\nBrize Norton to fill me in when my\nplane landed this morning. It seems\nthat a fairly large spaceship of\nunknown origin touched down in\nHyde Park yesterday, while I was still\nin Moscow. As it went undetected by\nour defence systems, its technology\nmust be way ahead of ours.'\n'Yet no one\u2014or nothing\u2014has\nemerged from it since it landed. Or\nnothing visible. I should say,' added\nL.. 'The Russians were as surprised as\nthe British,' Premium informed her.'\nThey do not believe that any nation\non Earth could have launched a spaceship undetected by their\nsatellites, or landed one here without\ntriggering all the early warning\nsystems. And if we're up against little\nmen from space\u2014and I hope they are\nmen\u2014then my usual seduction\ntechnique will be of no avail.'\nShe smoothed the rumpled red,\nwhite and blue miniskirt down over\nher gold tights, then continued: T suppose the technical boys have\nmonitored the ship by all possible\nmethods?'\n'Yes. it's no discharging any kind\nof detectable vapour, either from\nchemical fuels or biological activity.\nNeither is it transmitting\nelectronically, although it is picking\nup all kinds of TV wavelengths from\nthe air.'\n'Poor devils if they've got nothing\nbetter to do than to watch that trash,'\nmuttered Premium, pushing a stray\nlock of blond hair back under the\nbandages. 'But how did they turn 0-2\nand 0-4 into religious fanatics if the\nship is inactive? Do speak up a bit too,\nplease.'\n'Ah, we didn't let the media\ntransmit, this, but just before the ship\nlanded, it ejected a whole lot of small\npackages over London. Each\ncontained a Walkman-type portable\ncassette player, complete with\nbatteries and tape. Not realising that\nthey came from space, people picked\nthem up and used them. They play\nsome kind of percussive pop music\nand turn the listeners into zombies.'\n'What's new about that?' asked\nPremium, finishing her bloody-Margaret with an appreciative swig.\n'Have we had one of these tapes\nanalysed?'\n'Several\u2014they are all the same, but\none of the Q Branch girls, Cathering\nGoodeve, was converted while\nlistening d ruing the analysis. She's under close observation and keeps\ntalking a bot the second coming!'\n'The second coming?' Premium\nexclaimed. 'Christ!'\n'Christ is not known to travel by\nspaceship,' said L drily. 'These\nzombies don't seem dangerous yet,\nbut that might be part of a careful plan\nto fool us, and to divert attention away\nfrom the spaceship. The converts\npreach a sort of low-grade, simplified\nChristianity\u2014the kind of thing an\nAmerican Bible-puncher might\nbroadcast to less educated people. But\nit is all rather garbled. The os cill os cpe analysis of the tapes shows interesting\nhigh and low frequency subliminal\nsignals amongst the pop music, but\nno one can see how they work.'\n'Can I interview Christine?' asked\nPremium.\n'Yes\u2014not if you like. The converts\ndon't seem able to recruit others\ndirectly, fortunately for us. If the\nspaceship starts to broadcast such\nsignals, we're ready to jam them\nimmediately. The PM agreed to\nprovide the most powerful jamming\ntransmitters the army has got, because\nshe doesn't want any bunch of aliens\nspoiling her third term of office.'\nTwenty minutes later. Premium and\nher boss returned to L's office. As\nthey passed Mr Cashpound's desk,\nPremium noticed the wistfully\nadmiring looks he gave her over his\nencrypt o typewriter.\n'Another blue-blooded Margaret?'\nhe suggested.\n'Yes, please,' said L, firmly\nushering 0-1 into her office as\nPremium blew a kiss to Mr\nCashpound.\n'Well,' asked L. 'What did you\nmake of the convert? She said more\nor less the same when I saw her\nearlier. What on earth does she want\npictures of pale roses for, and why\ndoes she ask how much money we\ngain? And what has it got to do with\nreligion?'\nPremium hardly seemed to hear L's deep contralto voice, as her mind\ngrasped at straws.\nSuddenly she raised her head ans\nasked:\n'Do you know what homonyms are,\nL?' 'No\u2014something to do with men if\nit starts with \"homo\" and interests\nyou. Perhap's men's names?'\n'Wrong this time, L. \"Homonym'\ncomes from the Greek homos, alike,\nnot from the Latin homo, man.\nHomonyms are words having the\nsame sound but different meanings.\nThey may be spelled the same or\ndifferently. It those aliens intercepted\nTV and radio signals from here as\nthey approached Earth, they might\nknow only the sounds of our words,\nand could easily confuse words of the\nAfter a short visit to Q section, who\nfitted a small two-way radio under her\nhead bandages, Premium was driven\nin an unmarked car to Hyde Park\nCorner where she joined the crowd\nof curious onlookers. She worked her\nway up Park Lane, which had been\nclosed to traffic, until she reached the\ncordon of soldiers and police\nsurrounding the alien ship.\n'Strictly no one to be allowed\nthrough, that's our orders,' said the\nharassed young sergeant. He blushed\nas Premium stroked his smooth pink\ncheek with her fingers. She showed\nhim her special WI5 pass with the\nother hand.\nTil have to check with\nheadquarters,' he said, putting his\nhand to his radio.\n'You will not!' ordered Premium.\n'Don't you realise th t the aliens\nmonitor all our radio signals and\nunderstand our language? This pass\npermits me to go anywhere, without\nquestion.'\nThe sergeant draw back in\nconfusion as Premium's carmine lips\nsame sound and different meaning.\nBeing more advanced than, us, they\nhave probably got rid of such\nconfusions from their own language\nand might not expect them in ours.'\n'Ah, then they could have put the\nwrong message on the tapes prepared\nfor use on Earth? Good thinking, yes\ndo come in, Cashpound, just leave the\ntray there please. Thank you. Go on,\nPremium.'\n'With these wretched head\nbandages, I 've mis heard quite a lot of\nsimilar-sounding words in the lat two\ndays. That made me think about\nhomonyms and near-homonyms.\nReligious fanatic's obsession with\n1\n-BLONDE\n5\u00a3CcoyfjD\npictures of pale roses could arise if\nthe aliens instructed he to seek out the\nprints of peace, the rose, instead of\nthe Prince of Peace, meaning Christ.\nSimilarly, she could have been told\nto worship the profits, instead of the\nProphets. That mind-numbing pop\nmusic could stop the listeners from\nfinding these errors for themselves.'\n'That's so absurd that it just has to\nbe true, Premium! So what do you\nthink the aliens are after?'\n'They could be trying to raise\nreligious consciousness, to make sure\nof a friendlier rect pion when they\nemerge\u2014my instincts tell me it's not\nan unmanned probe. Perhaps they aim\nto use religion as a tool of power, as\nmany humans have done before. If\nthey can turn people like Catherine\ninto zombies with one tape, you can\nimagine what more thorough\nconditioning could do. Then again, it\nreally could be Christ's second\ncoming, in a form appropriate for\n20th century man\u2014but I doubt it.'\n'And what do you suggest we do\nnext, single 0-1?'\n'When I 've finished my drink, I think I'l pay a social call on those\naliens. These mental efforts exhaust\nme\u2014I'm a woman of action at heart.'\nHi approached his thin moustache.\nShe das e hd past, vaulting the metal\nbarrier in one easy movement.\nIgnoring the shouts from behind, she\ndarted ahead towards the sleek\ncylinder, which stood vertically on its\nfour tail fins near Speaker's Corner.\nIts smooth surface gleamed in the pale\nApril sun.\nThe crowd watched in awe as she\nsi owed down, walking casually but\ngracefully towards the two hundred\nfoot high space ship.\nWhe she was only a few feet away,\nshe raised her open hands in a friendly\ngesture and called out:\n'You are welcome here, aliens. I salute the prints of Peace and worship\nthe Profits. I come without weapons\nto talk to you, to find out the purpose\nof your mission and how we can help.\nWe know that you understand spoken\nEnglish and come from a very\nadvanced civilisation. Let us talk\npeace together, face to face, if your\nbodies and mine can live in the same\natmosphere.'\nA gasp went up from the astonished\ncrowd as a panel near the base of the\nship slid noiselessly back. A shimmering silver ladder was lowered\nto the ground, emerging from the\ndarkness within.\nKeeping her two-way radio\nswitched off in case its activity was\ndetected by the aliens, Premium\nscrambled nimbly up the ladder. Her\nred, white and blue miniskirt fluttered\ngently in the breeze.\nShe strode boldly into the dark\nhold, peering into its gloomy\nrecesses. The door closed quietly\nbehind her, cutting off any retreat.\n'Greetings,' she called into the utter\ndarkness. 'Greetings and peace.\nWelcome to our visitors from outer\nspace.'\nHer heart hammered at her ribs as\nshe waited for a response. His now\nclammy hands toyed with her\nbandages, through which she could\njust hear the distant him of\nmachinery.\n'Greetings, single 0-1!'\nPremium looked up, startled by the\ndeep yet mechanical voice. It came\nfrom a long way up, in the total\nblackness.\nSuddenly a screen lit up brightly,\na few feet above her head. The image\nfaltered for a moment, then focussed\nin brilliant colour.\nThe image was of herself.\nAghast, Premium watched a slow-motion replay of herself addressing\nthe police sergeant. The frame froze\nfor a moment as she flourished her\npass. A zoom enlargement showed\nevery word crystal-clear on that pass.\n'I 'll have to check with\nheadquarters,' she heard the\npoliceman say.\nThe film showed her almost kissing\nthe officer, and even she had to\nadmire the graceful way in which her\nimage vaulted the grey metal barrier.\n'Yes, Premium,' said the alien.\n'Our vocal and visual monitoring all\nround the ship is quite effective, at\nleast where we have direct line of\nsight. You have now been checked\nfrom all angles.'\nShe blushed,pushing her skirt closer\ngain st her thighs, as the film ended\nwith her ascent of the ladder.\nDarkness returned.\nT think you might prefer some\nlight,' continued the metallic tones,\n'so let there be light.Our purpose is\npeaceful, not hostile. We admire you\nfor approaching us so openly, even\nagainst the wishes of your\ngovernment's poli c/ force. Any\nmilitary threat against us would be\nvery foolish, as our weapons and\ndefences are infinitely superior.'\nA soft pink light suddenly suffused\nthe ship's interior, revealing fixed\nladders ascending the smooth metal\nwalls. There were no aliens in sight,\nto Premium's dia spp ointment. 'May I come up and meet you, face\nto face?' She called, i have no hidden\nweapons, and doubtless your\ndetectors will already have told you\nthat my concealed radio is switched\noff.'\ni admire your honesty, Premium,\nand it w oud be foolish to try to\ndeceive us. We know more about you\nthan you might think. In space we\nintercepted part of a film about your\nfather, the celebrated secret agent,\nJames Bond. You are like him in\nmany ways. Now you can climb the\nladder on y or left, to the conference\nchamber\u2014it is the third room up, the\none with the open door.'\nPremium eagerly climbed the softly\nshimmering ladder, he inquisitive\nfingers probing every surface as she\ndid so. Inwardly she laughed at the\nalien's simplicity, his naive\nassumption about her ancestry, when\nthe two names, Bond and Blonde,\nwere only homonyms! She thought\nfondly of the days gone by when the\nageing James had been one of her\nearliest lovers. Poor clumsy James,\nbut he had never, never been her\nfather!\nThe small, curved conference\nchamber was bathed in a gentle\namber light.\n'Please sit down,' said the central\nalien. He was flanked by four similar\nfigures with hexagonal metal heads\nand hexagonal metal bodies. The\ncentral alien had two arms and two\nmulti-jointed legs, ending in magnetic\nclamps. The other aliens had two,\nfour or six arms, and an incredible\narray of legs. Premium stared at their\nlower limbs, which varied from one,\nending in the caterpillar-track\nmovement, to six jointed, flexed,\nmetal rods, like legs on a fly.\nEach alien had what appeared to be\na pair of eye units in each of the six\nvertical head facets, perhaps with\nothers she couldn't see. It seemed to\nPremium that the aliens stared back\nat her legs as she crossed them high\non the th ich, after sliding into the soft\nbut transparent glossy chair, she was\nquite used to being stared at, but not\nby more than one pair of eyes per\nhead.

    "content": "OPINION\nChris Martin is the Publications Board Chairman and FELIX\nBusiness Manager. He has been heavily involved in the running\nof Imperial College Union for several years whilst per suing a Computing PhD. He received a Union General Award last year.\nWhat is consensus? Quite simply,\nwhen everyone involved agrees with\na decision, that's consensus. Does it\never happen? It does\u2014it's the way we\nmake decisions every day, with our\nfriends, our colleagues and our\nfamilies. We all get together and\ndecide what we are going to do...if\nwe're going for a meal, and one of\nus doesn't care for Chinese cooking,\nwe all won't go to a Chinese\nrestaurant. There's no question of\nvotes for, votes against and 'the ayes\nhave it'; no 'procedural motions', no\nspeeches, and no time limit. We keep\ntalking until we decide where we all\nwant to go.\nThe problem with a vote is that\nthere are winners and losers. In every\ncase, one side comes out on top. The\nwhole way, for example, that motions\nare debated encourages this\n'ad verso rial' idea. You do battle with\nyour opponent, and one of you is the\nvictor. The loser always feels, in\nsome sense, beaten; they aren't encouraged to take part in whatever\ndecision has been taken. They\nsometimes may even work directly\nagainst the decision.\nWhat effect does this behaviour\nhave? We go along to a committee for\nthe first time, and see two groups of\npeople bashing each other with\nimpassioned speeches and vote upon\nvote. There's shouting and yelling\u2014\nhave you ever been to a UGM?\u2014and\nconfusion upon confusion of standing\norders and procedural motions.\nWouldn't it be nice to have a single\nThen as Now?\nIn 1934 HG Wells wrote of Imperial College:\nIt is today a huge fung oid assemblage of buildings and schools\nwithout a visible centre, guiding purpose or directive brain. It\nhas become a constituent of the still vaster, still more\nconspicuously a cephalic monster, the University of London.\nThe thumbs y wisdom of the practical man, with a conception\nof life based on immediate needs, un analysed motives and\nheadlong assumptions, and with an innate fear of free and\nsearching thought, is still manifest at a hundred points in the\nstructure and working of this great aggregation.\nThe struggle to blend technical equipment with a carefully\ncherished illiteracy, an intact oafish ness about fundamental\nthings, has been well sustained. South Kensington will still tell\nyou proudly, 'We are not literary,' and explain almost anxiously\nthat the last thing it wants to impart is a liberal education.\nThe ideal output of the Imperial College remains a swarm of\nmechanical, electrical and che mi mechanical, electrical and\nchemical business smart ies, guaranteed to have no capacity for\nsocial leadership, constructive combination or original thought.\nThe Imperial College was and is still in fact not a college but\na sprawl of laboratories and classrooms. Whatever ideas of\npurpose wrestled together in its beginnings are now forgotten.\nIt has no firm idea of what it is and what it is supposed to\ndo. That is to say, it has no philosophy. It has no philosophical\norganisation, no social idea, no rat ionised goal, to hold it\ntogether.\nI had come up to South Kensington persuaded that I should\nlearn everything. I found myself in South Kensington lost and\ndismayed at the multitudinous in consecutive ness of everything.\nUGM where we stick exactly to the\nagenda, with no procedural motions\nat all?. There are rules at these\nmeetings intended to allow the\nmeeting to proceed in an orderly\nfashion. Yet time and again we see\nthe professional hacks, who know the\nrule book back to front, cause the\ndebate to disappear behind walls of\nprocedure. They forget, or perhaps it\nisn't in their interests to realise, that\nthe debate should come before the\nprocedure.\nImagine the advantages if every\ndecision we took had the support of\neverybody in the Union. No one\nwould be alienated or feel left out, and\nthey might even be encouraged to join\nin themselves.\nIt's important to realise that this\nisn't as difficult as it sounds. Of\ncourse, if you're familiar with the\nprocedure, it's relatively easy to push\na vote through a committee or two.\nBut what have you gained? If your\nidea is really going to catch hold, you\nhave to persuade not just the people\nthat might agree with you anyway,\nbut also, and perhaps more\nimportantly, those that don't. Forcing\na vote only alienates these people\nfurther. Persuading them to agree\nwith you gets them on your side.\nIf you have an idea, then, the\nquestion shouldn't be \"what,\ncommittee can I force this through\",\nbut \"how can I best get people in\nsupport of this\". There is nothing\nworse than turning up to a meeting\nwith a bunch of papers, talking for\nhalf an hour, and then passing the\nwhole lot on the vote. What you\nshould do is talk to the people\ninvolved before you start writing the\nfirst word: they might have some\nbetter ideas than (even!) you. You get\nthem involved in drafting a proposal;\nyou consult all those concerned. Once\nyou reach the stage of presenting your\nproposal to a meeting, ideally you\nhave a consensus. The meeting then\nconcentrates on how it can best\nimplement the ideas.\nWhy am I talking of consensus and\ndivision? Well, in our own Union, the\nPresident is a person with strong\nviews and a will to get things done:\nto him, it appears, the ends justify the\nmeans. If he has to force votes to get\nthings through, he will. I 've locked\nswords with him on more than a few\noccasions myself. I agree with a lot\nof what he has done. I disagree with\njust about every way he has gone\nabout it.\nThe first time we battled was over\nthe censorship of the Freshers'\nHandbook. I proposed a motion\nwhich clearly was contentious; we\nhad a debate and, more by luck than\njudgement, the motion was ref en x back to the next meeting. Before the\nnext meeting, we got together, we\ndiscovered on what we agreed and on\nwhat we differed; I then drew up\nanother motion on which we both\nagreed. This was passed at the next\nmeeting without further ado. That\nmotion is now Union policy and\neveryone is happy with it. A far better\noutcome than if the original motion\nhad been voted for, or against.\nThis has been the exception rather\nthan the norm: since, then we have\nseen many things, most notably the\nnew Union job descriptions, pushed\nthrough with only cursory debate and\nconsultation. Ian (or Sydney, or\nwhatever) has had a great deal on his\nagenda and it was inevitable that\ndecisions which, with time, could\nbeen unanimous, have instead been\ndivisor y. Again, when it comes to FELIX,\nwhen the Union disagrees it doesn't try (as once it would have) to get\neveryone together and sort the\nproblem out. Instead we have division\nand another newspaper.\nI am sure the President would say\nthat the votes that have been taken are\nnecessary, that there was no other\nway and whatever division they\ncaused is unfortunate but\nunavoidable. He may be right\u2014it all\ndepends on where you draw the line\nbetween getting things done and\nkeeping the Union together. I hope\nthat he isn't right, and that the 'new\nbreed of student activist' he claims to\nbe, isn't the same species as\ntomorrow's City whizz kid, raking in\nthe \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s without regard to the rest of\nsociety.\nFELIX Friday 3rd June 1988 3\n\n"

The pasta\nis rolled out into big sheets and cut\ninto rectangular patches. A specially\nprepared stuffing is placed in the\nmiddle of each rectangle which is\nfolded into shape to fit the navel of\nVenus\u2014the Goddess of Love, Sex\nand the Joy of Life. So, when you\nmen eat the exquisite tor tell in i imagine that it has been graced by\nVenus, if you are a woman think of\nthe torrid Mars (God of War) as\nVenus would no doubt have done\nwhile eating this creation.\nVenice\nIC's resident expert on many aspects\nof Italian gastronomy warns that\nVenice is the classic tourist trap over\nthe summer months. The expensive\nrestaurants are out of the range of\nmost students but are the only ones\nthat maintain high culinary standards.\nThe other establishments raise their\nprices but lower their stand rad s.I suggest that you eat sandwiches\nfor lunch and go to 'terra ferm a' to\nhave dinner. Venice is connected to\nMestre by a bridge. Take a bus and\ngo to at rat tori a in Mestre. Those who\ninsist on eating in Venice should try\nthe tr at tori as in Guidecca (the former\nJewish quarter). This quarter is\nlocated in the island across the water\nfrom San Marco's Square and is\nclearly visible in the distance.\nGuidecca is relatively unspoilt by\ntourists and the prices will be lower.\nSpecial tips\n'Do Ferni' (the two ovens) is\nrecommended for those willing to\nspend \u00a325 per head, you will undergo\nan adventure in Venetian cuisine\ninvolving 10-15 courses of fish\ndishes. You can expect a mussel dish\nand spaghetti per scat or a( fisherman's style spaghetti) amongst the courses.\nUniversal points\nBuying icecream\u2014The best icecream\ncan be got at places that display the\nGelateria Artigianle or Produzione\nPropria signs. It would be wise to go\nto places which only sell icecream.\nDrinking coffee\u2014It might be worth\npointing out that Italians drink\nCapuccino for breakfast and Expresso\nafter dinner. The term 'cafe\nmacchi e to' should be used when\nrequesting coffee with a drop of milk.\nOrdering wine\u2014 'Vino de la Cassa'\nwill be the cheapest wine you will be\nable to order to accompany your food.\nThis will be decanted into a carafe\nthen served to you. Never accept any\nother wine that is not uncorked in\nfront of you.\nEating in a pizza ria \u2014This\nmagnificent creation of Italian\ncooking must be cooked in an oven\nfired by wood. The places where you\nget take-away pizzas will be using\nelectric ovens mostly. Those seeking\nthe authentic pizza experience should\nonly eat at establishments where one\ncan see the 'Pizzaiolo' preparing the\npizzas and using a wood fired oven.\nSeasonal dishes\u2014Cook out for\n'Rissoto con i Bruscandoli' when\neating in at rat tori a. This r is so to dish\nuses a wild vegetable gathered in\nJune/July.\nAt rat tori a \u2014Trattorias are often run\nby a family. You will find plenty of\nopportunity to sample what is\neffectively home cooking. A wide\nselection of dishes cooked to a good\nstandard can be expected.\nRecipe by special request\nROGAN JOSH\nThis familiar Indian meat dish is a classic that is easy to prepare. Its\nsecret lies in the reddish colour\ndeveloped from the paprika and the\nslightly sour taste of the yogurt.\nI have been requested to include\nmore rec i pies. Two people in Holbein\nHouse asked that I include my Rogan\nJosh recipe which has been admired\nby a number of people.\nIngredients\n2lbs boned lamb cut into cubes\n'A pint of water or chicken stock\nVi pint of whole milk set yogurt\nSpices: 2-3 bay leaves, 6-10\ncloves, 2 large c in amon sticks, 2\nblack cardo mom pods (optional), 1\nheaped tsp cum min seeds, 5 tsp\npaprika, 1-2 tsp chilli powder, 1.5\ntsp garr am massa la.8 cloves garlic\n1 inch piece of ginger\n3 medium size onions.\nMethod\nChop the garlic and ginger very finely\nor blend them with a little water into\na paste. Chop the onions finely. Grind\nthe cum min seeds. Fry the lamb\npieces in vegetable oil until lightly\nbrown. Remove from the frying pan.\nHeat up a little oil, add the bay leaves,\ncloves, cinnamon and cardo mom pods. Fry until the bay leaves change\ncolour and the cloves swell up. Add\nthe cum min, immediately followed by\nthe onions. Fry on medium heat until\nall the onions become soft. Add the\nginger and garlic and continue the\nfrying. Add the fried lamb cubes and\nfry for a few minutes. Lower the\nflame. Add a little yogurt and\ncontinue stirring. Add more and more\nyogurt gradually until all of it has\nblended in with the sauce. Add the\npaprika, chilli powder and chicken\nstock or water. Bring to the boil,\nsimmer the meat for Vi hours stirring\nin term it tant ly. Examine the thickness\nof the sauce. Remove the lid of the\npot if it is looking water. Continue\nsimmering until the lamb is tender.\nNever thicken the sauce by vigorous\nboiling but by gentle reduction.\nAdd the garam massa la a few\nminutes before serving this dish with\nsome rice. Add salt and freshly\nground pepper to taste.\nI would like to dedicate this article to\nLuca Zullo. Thanks to him a number\nof pasta and risotto dishes will always\nbe served at my dinner table. I hope\nthis article managed to reflect the love\nLuca managed to convey to me when\ntalking about Italian food.\nNext week\nThe gastronomic survey takes a look\nat eating in Verona, Florence and\nRome.\nCiou,\nYishu.\nFELIX Friday 3rd June 1988 7\n\n"
