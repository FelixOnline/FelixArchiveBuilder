    "content": "LCLUBS\nSF SOC\nWho's at IC?\nThe Doctor climbed out from beneath the\nTardis' console and peered into the rear\nscanner screen. They were still there \u2014 a vast hoard of lavishly be weapon ed Liberoid\ncollection cruisers. 'Lets see what they make\nof this then', he thought as he reversed the\npolarity of the neutron flow in the temporal\nstability matrix disc on mo gri fier. He felt\nreality fade out for a moment and then he\nwas back in the Tardis again. Another glance\nat the scanner \u2014 no they were still there.\n'Hmmm! Their time distort drive seems\nhighly advanced. Perhaps they've been\nreading some of their books.\nHe cast his mind back to the event that\nhad caused his current predicament. It was\n1985, Earth, London, Imperial College\nScience Fiction society, and he had\nborrowed a book. Then, back at UNIT\nheadquarters, the Tardis had thrown a fit\nand plunged him into the future. There he\ndiscovered this fleet following him and\nrealised the full horror of what had\nhappened. The gnomes of IC had finally\ntaken over the world. Aided by their newly\nacquired sci en fit ic knowledge they leapt\nahead in technology and, after a few hundred\nyears, decided to check up on past\noffenders. Fleets of specifically engineered\nships scoured the universe seeking all those\nwho had broken standing orders\u2014 the\npublicity violators, those who were not\ndiscrete or unavoidable, but worst of all were\nthe surrogate librarians; genetically\nengineered to locate, at five spaces, an\noverdue book and immediately home in onto\nits target. Due to an unfortunate time\nparadox, the doctor had only had the book\nfor five hours, but according to the librarians'\nframe of reference, it was 10,000 years\noverdue. Now they were coming, forcing\ntheir way through the spacetime continuum,\nto repossess the book and, worse still, to\ncollect the fine.\nThere was one hope left, a slim one, a desperate one. He set the co-or dina tors on\nthe console and, hoping beyond hope that\nthe Tardis, just once, would do what it was\ntold, pressed the button marked 'go'.\nSeconds later the Tardis materialise d. 'Not bad,' thought the Doctor, as he checked\nhis position; 'almost right'. He opened the\n(door and stepped out into...pitch dark.\n'What's happened now? I bet the bloody\nthing's broken again', he thought. But then\nlight appeared in front of him, gradually\nresolving itself into a picture. 'Oooh Goody,'\nthought the Doctor, 'it worked. And it's one\nof my favourites'. The white screen before\nhim read EXCALIBUR. He had made it to\nthe SF soc film on February 5 \u2014 Excalibur\ndirected by John Boorman, and could now\nwarn himself not to borrow the book. But\nwait, that would mean he wouldn't get\nchased by the librarians so he wouldn't have\nto come back and warn himself which meant\nhe would borrow the book and so would\nget....\nCome along to the SF Soc film Excalibur\non Tuesday Feb 5 \u2014 a fantastic film and you\nnever know who might drop in.\nPS. if you've got any books overdue from\nour library bring them back to a library\nmeeting any Thursday lunchtime in The\nGreen Committee room in The Union\nBuilding. We don't want to have to send the\nsurrogate librarian out to get you...we'd have\nto take over the world first.\nCIV ENG SOC\nMore Boring\nThere are several events we are organising\nfor this term, all of which promise to be\nsuccessful. The first event will be the site visit\nto the Humber Bridge on Wednesday 13\nFebruary organised by Vernon Gaskell our\nsite visit rep. The cost should be between \u00a33\nand \u00a34 for the travel costs (we hope to go by\ncoach if there is enough support).\nThe next event is the next day, Thursday\n14 February, to the Institution of Structural\nEngineers, who are holding an open week.\nFor the above two events see the Civ Eng\nnotice board (opp 201) for more information\nand to sign up for the trips\nThe main event of the year for Civ Eng Soc\nis the Annual Civ Eng Dinner, which will be\nheld on Thursday 14 February at a cost of\napproximately \u00a310.

    "content": "FELIX\nCLETTERS\nOUR\nRight Human\nRight's wrongs\nIRAte\nDear Sir,\nJudging by last week's FELIX letters and a number of other sources there seems to be\nwidespread misunderstanding of Cathsoc's Human Rights Week article on Nothern\nIreland. No-one is condoning the IRA's activities: I detest terrorism just as much as\nanyone else. However, calling the IRA\npsychopaths and doing nothing achieves very\nlittle except to harden attitudes and makes\nprogress harder. The British government\nmakes the situation worse by fueling the hate\nthat the IRA feed on. One example of this is\nthe use of plastic bullets which do kill and\ninjure. Everytime someone is killed by a plastic bullet the IRA gain aps cho logical victory \u2014 they have a 'martyr' so can stir hate\nand continue their bloody violence.\nYours sincerely\nMark Alderton\nCathsoc Secretary\nPS The European Parliament is to debate the\nPrevention of Terrorism Act when only 3%\nare prosecuted.\nBad taste\nDear Sir,\nI feel I must complain in the strongest\nterms possible about the thoroughly tasteless\nand disgusting publicity gim mik ry employed\nrecently by Ents to promote the very last\nnight of their Lounge 'Nightclub' as it is\nrather ambitiously called.\nI am referring of course to the recent\nposters and articles which have been\npolluting FELIX and the rest of College (ie\n'The Lounge is dead' and so on).\nEvidently Ents seem to think it amusing to\nput on such a tasteless event as a 'Funeral\nParty' (and I am told that they have even\ngone to the extremes of hiring in special \u2014\npresumably fun e rial ha-bloody-ha-lighting\neffects and silent horror movies to be shown\nduring the night) but personally I find the\nwhole thing thoroughly distasteful.\nI trust that no-one who has any pride in\ntheir inestimable position as students in\nImperial College would be sufficiently sick\nminded to attend such a degrading event.\nYours angrily,\nHorace Limey\nDear Sir,\nI feel moved to say that I do not believe\nHuman Rights Week, in this present regular\nform, is the most effective way of promoting\nknowledge and concern about human rights\nat IC. Politically partisan groups should\neither not be allowed to stage Human Rights\nWeek events, or they should be much more\nclosely supervised when they do. At the JCR\nexhibition last Thursday, for example, I saw\nprecious little material on the Consoc stand\nwhich had direct relevance to human rights;\nmuch more in evidence was a poster\npromoting nuclear deterrence. The small\ndisplay mounted by the UNA failed to\nmention human rights as far as I could see,\nalthough this group has a quite valid (and\npreferably much larger) role to play in any\ndiscussion of human rights. (I should say that\nI visited the exhibition in the mid-afternoon:\nif UNA had by that time dismantled part of\ntheir display I apologise, and withdraw my\ncomment).\nThe in advisability of allowing political\ngroups to participate independently in\nHuman Rights Week was also demonstrated\non Tuesday. Anybody who arrived early at\nthe U GM would have witnessed what\nappeared to be a 'full and frank discussion'\nbetween members of the college Amnesty\ngroup and the real sponsors of the motion on\nIraq. The original motion condemned the\nIraqi Government itself (rather than certain\nof that government's actions, as amended)\nand even in its amended form, the motion,\nlike the posters which festooned college,\ndescribed the Iraqi Government as fascist:\nhardly tactful considering that the welfare of\nnumerous political detainees, whose interests\nthe motion is intended to further, rests in the\nhands of that government (and the Iraqi\nEmbassy is only the other side of Queensgate,\nso this 'fascist' slur could easily come to their\nnotice).\nIf Human Rights Week is to continue as an\nannual event, I believe that Amnesty\nInternational and other groups whose prime\nconcerns include human rights should have a more prominent role. However, I think there\nare strong arguments for discontinuing the\nevent; individual groups could probably\nproduce a greater impact if their efforts were\nspread throughout the year. Perhaps those\nresponsible for organising last week's events\ncould consider this.\nPS I do not represent the college Amnesty\ngroup.\nPeter Hobbis\nLast week's comments about the College's laissez-faire attitude to repairs in Willis\nJackson revealed a serious lack of planning.\nAlthough Estates knew in May 1984 that\nrepairs had to be done in Evelyn Gardens, the\nwork will not begin until next month.\nSo far the Kensington and Chelsea Council\nhas only served a 'notice' on Willis Jackson\nHouse. Inevitably they will serve notices on\nthe other, identical houses in Evelyn Gardens\nin due course. But the Estates Department\nhave decided not even to plan to do work on\nthese other houses until notices are served.\nWhat is more they aren't going to set aside\nany money for the work to be done. So the\nCollege could suddenly be landed with repair\nbills of up to \u00a3250,000.\nWhy hasn't the Estates Section planned a phased repair programme for the next few\nyears? This could be arranged to cause least\ninconvenience to students, and would allow\nfor the financial burden to be spread out. But\ndoubtless this is to ascribe too much sense to\nEstates. Doubtless they will wait until the last\nmoment. Doubtless they will again force\nstudents out of their rooms during exam\ntime. Doubtless they will arrange for the\nwork to be done at the maximum possible\ncost.\nIn short, they will doubtless ensure, as\nalways, that the 'students interests are of\nprime importance'.\nJust a brief word about FELIX Diary entries.\nThe forms for the Diary are kept in the\nFELIX Office, and should be completed and\nhanded in on Monday to ensure publication\nthe following Friday. You may, if you wish,\nobtain a small supply of Diary forms if\nyou,make many entries.\nFinally, I must confess that this issue hasn't received my fullest attention. I was admitted\nto ho spiti al last Friday and only got back\nyesterday. The credit for this issue goes, then,\nto those who stepped into the breach,\nespecially J Martin Taylor and Hugh\nSouthey, without whom this issue wouldn't have appeared at all.

    "content": "REVIEWSD\nSINGLES\nFlash and The Pan: Midnight\nMan\nIn the three years since\n'Waiting For A Train', Flash\ndoesn't seem to have\nprogressed very much. A very\n1982 sound in fact. Pleasant\nenough but certainly nothing\nspecial. I can imagine Rod\nStewart doing this song, but I wouldn't buy his version\neither.\nGeorge Benson: 20/20\nI have to admit I know very\nlittle about George Benson's music. I was expecting an 'In\nyour eyes' ballad sound, but\ninstead I was treated to a feast\nof synth-funk. The pro duc tion, particularly the stereo-imaging, is superb; the feel is\ngreat. The song however, is\nunmemorable.\nI Start Counting: Letters To A Friend\nA typical Mute sound (ala\nDepeche Mode) with lots of\nkeyboards and choral vocal\nharmonies. This is the debut\nsingle from Dave Baker and\nSimon Leonard, and as such is\nvery impressive. Can't wait to\nhear the12 inch extended mix.\nWatch this band \u2014 they're\ngonna be big!\nThe Colourfield: Thinking of\nYou\nWell, despite my pleas, noone bought the first two\nsingles from the Colourfield. If\nthis one doesn't at last break\nthe band into the charts I shall\nbe most pissed off. It is the\nbest of what was the voice of\nthe Specials and the Funboy\nThree, without the\ndepression.\nBOOKS\nJobs Abroad\nWorking Holidays in 1985\nIf you want to do something\ndifferent on the cheap as well\nas filling up one of those\nem baras sing holes on your\nCV you could do a lot worse\nthan going on a working\nholiday abroad. There are\nquite a few books trying to\nhelp you in your quest for\nemployment overseas. Some\nare very expensive, some have\ndod gy chapters on forging\nwork permits, and some are\nrather thin. Thankfully\n'Working Holidays in 1985' is\nnone of these. Published by\nthe Central Bureau for\nEducational Visits and\nExchanges it kicks off with\ntwenty-odd pages of general\nadvice, and then launches into\nnearly 300 pages of listings of\nopenings country by country,\nwith other useful information\nsuch as where to get a Polish\nrailway ticket and how to get\nin touch with the local British\nconsulate. The jobs range\nfrom grape picking in France\n(yawn...) to the trendy\nBulgarian work camps which\npromise discussions on the\ntheme of East-West detente\nand solidarity (whatever that\nis).\nUnlike most of its kind this\nbook concentrates on\ngovernment-run schemes and\ncommunity projects, not\ncommercial employers. Although the pay may not be\nas good, or.even non-existent,\nit does mean that a330 page\nbook can contain many\nthousands of opportunities.\nThere are some jobs in the UK\nas well, but for the reasons\nmentioned above you might\nwell be better off financially if\nyou get a job in C&A in Oxford\nStreet.\nGo to Collets Travel\nBookshop in Charing Cross\nRoad tomorrow and get\nyourself an interesting\nvacation. Make sure you have\na look at 'Working Holidays\n1985' when you're browsing. It\nmay turn out to be the best \u00a34\nyou spend all year.\nBEVEIOTJPlLLS\nBeverly Hills Cop\nEddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Lisa\nEilbacher.\nDirected by Martin Brest.\nEddie Murphy is on the\ncrest of a wave. After 'Trading\nplaces' and '48 Hours', two\nfilms which set him up at least\nin this country, if not in the\nStates, as the funniest\ncomedian since Richard Prior,\nhis reputation as much as\nactor as funny-man, relies\nheavily on the success of this\nfilm.\nHere, Eddie Murphy plays a young overzealous detective,\nAxel Foley, supposedly 'on\nvacation' in Beverly Hills.\nSecretly investigating the\nmurder of his companion, ex-convict Mikey Tandino\n(Jonathan Banks), and tailed\nby the Beverly Hills Police\nDepartment, Foley uncovers\nthe inevitable drug ring which,\nafter a larger shoot-out than\nmost, (they do things big out\nthere), he single-handedly\nbrings to its knees. What a hunk!\nRather than being a simple\nshowcase for the young\ncomedian, 'Beverly Hills Cop',\nas with the two films before it,\nrelies very heavily on a substantial, although barely\ncredible , plot. But the drama\nand the humour rarely mix.\nThe humour belongs exclusively to Murphy, (at the\nexpense of the rest of the\ncast), and Brest's attempt to\nreturn to the plot tends to\nbreak the balance rather than\ntilt it. The net result is a soap\nbox thriller, and a poor one at\nthat, but interspersed by some\nsimply brilliant humour and\naction in a variety of different\nsituations. Of course, after all\nthe pre-publicity, it's easy to\nexpect too much of this film,\nbut if you've never seen Eddie\nMurphy, you'll love it. What\nthe hell, go see it.\nFELIX Friday 25 January 1985 9\n\n"

    "content": "LZFEATURE:\nCHRISTIAN UNION\nThe Christian Union is one of IC\nUnion's largest societies. However,\nthe average IC student knows little\nabout the CU. In this series of short\narticles CU members describe their\nactivities.\nThe CU, as the Christian Union is more\npopularly known (and although not to be\nconfused with the 'Commercial Union', I reckon that the life assurance policy we offer\nis the best available!) has been around a good\nmany years. Records go back as far as 1937,\nwritten in delicate and faultless copper plate handwriting, telling of cream teas with local\nvicars, budgets noted in shillings and\nadjourn em ents to committee meetings due\nto wartime bombings. Today the Christian\nUnion is as dynamic and in step with the\ntimes as ever seeing growth both in numbers\nand in the level of involvement with College\nlife. One of our primary reasons for being a Christian Union is to draw together people\nwho want to share with others some of the\njoy and excitement of the Christian life and to\nbe available as such to those who are\ninterested in discovering just what it means\nto be a Christians. It is as much, indeed more\na giving of a special love and of sharing of a life as it is prose ly ti singa religious truth.\nToday , many are unaware of these truths\nlacking knowledge of even basic Christian\nteaching. For this reason we look to bring\npeople to an awareness of the existence of a loving God-a God who became a man to live\nand then to die on this earth. A God who\ndesires above all things for us to come to\nknow him in a real and personal relationship.\nGod is Dead!\nThe cry of the 60's that 'God is dead' finds\nlittle to support its claims in a Church that\ntoday is seeing rapid growth in many parts of\nthe world and is beginning to experience\nagain many of the more spectacular events\nseen in the life and ministry of Jesus and of\nthe early Christian church (events recorded\nin the Gospels and Epistles of the New\nTestament part of the Bible). As Saint Paul\nwrites in one of those epistles, 'The Kingdon\nof God does not consist of words but of\npower. 'It is that power that continues to\nchange us as people, that releases us from\nthe pressures and anxieties of this world and\nwhich brings a new and dynamic lifestyle that\nencourages us to step out with greater faith\nin a God who is truly 'Alive in '85'.\nBible\nStudy\n.. .Members of the Christian Union on one of\ntheir weekends away.\nBy the time you have read this ari tic le it will\nbe clear that the Christian Union does not\nconsist just of a group who meet on Friday\nevenings and whose notices you see around\nCollege. There is a group who meets each\nweek in your department. As the title\nsuggests these groups are known as the\nBible Study groups and their main aim is to\nmeet and study the Bible and discuss what it\nhas to say to us today. You may not believe\nwhat the Bible says or perhaps you have\nnever read it. The groups could provide the\nopportunity to make a start.\nNot only do the groups meet to study\nGod's word but also to have a chat and\nenjoy good company. Most groups provide\nsome kind of lunch as in most departments\nthe meeting take place on either a Tuesday\nor Thursday lunchtime.\nIf you are interested and would like to\nmeet more Christians in your department or\nyou would like to know more of what\nChristianity is and of how it CAN totally\nchange your life, then contact your\ndepartmental group.\nPrayerthe CU\nPower-House\nPrayer is a vital and integral part of the life of\na Christian reflecting the intimacy of\nrelationship with a God, of love. So it is for\nthe Christian Union as a group. Almost daily\nmembers gather to pray with and for each\nother \u2014 not only as a CU but in\ndepartmental, hall and house groups. Most\nhalls of residence and student houses have\nor are in contact with a prayer group which\nmeets regularly.

Evidently\nDave Parry called it 'ill\nconceived, ill timed and ill\nworded' a motion was passed at\na UGM in early November\nthreatening refectory boycotts if\narb it ary price increases were\nimposed. Despite Dave Parry's reservations, the pressure seems\nto have had an effect and the\ncollege has now put someone to\nwork on the refectory pricing full-time in an attempt to iron out\nsome of the anomalies.

Boil\nfor ten minutes and leave to cool. Meanwhile prepare the fruit. (Boil blackcurrants\nfor ten minutes and sieve, peel kiwi fruit, remove the stones from cherries.)\nReduce the fruit to a puree by any means available. Combine with the syrup, and\nthen add lemon juice bit by bit until you can just taste it. Blend thoroughly and\nplace in a sealed container in the freezer.\nThe secret of all sorbet and ice-cream making now follows. After about two\nhours, the mixture is at the stage where it is just beginning to go solid. If you tip\nthe container, it won't run, but it's still quite soft. Now whisk the egg whites until\nthey are stiff but not dry, and fold them into the sorbet mixture. Keep mixing\ngently until the sorbet is uniform. Return to the freezer and leave for at least two\nhours (but probably longer). If you like you can give it a third stir after a couple of\nhours.\nThe double-freeze technique, the syrup and the bubbles all help to prevent the\nsorbet fr dom becoming brick-hard. It should be easy to serve no matter how cold\nit is. Once you have used the process a couple of times, you can experiment.

This is necessary\nbecause of the impending loss of the Fremantle Hotel,\nIn order to meet the guarantee\ngiven by the College to house all\nnew undergraduate and overseas\npostgraduate students it has been\nnecessary to use about fifty of the\nplaces in the Fremantle Hotel,\nwhich is leased by the College on\na head tenancy basis. The three\nyear lease expires at the end of\nthis session, meaning that if it is\nto maintain the guarantees the\nCollege will have to reduce the\nnumbers of non-guaranteed\ncategory residents in College\nowned accommodation. The\nStudent Residence Committee\ndecided on Wednesday that the\nshortfall will mainly be met by\nreducing the number of re-applicants, students who spend a second year in a Hall or House to\nprovide some continuity in social\nlife, by at least thirty. This\nrepresents a reduction from 10%\nto about 8% of places, although\nthe cuts may not be implemented\nuniformly since Wardens are to\nconsider each residence\nindividually before final\ndecisions are taken.\nThe remaining shortfall will be\nmet by a combination of extra\nplaces in College flats and\nexisting residences and\nreductions in other categories\nsuch as Union places, which ICU\nhas agreed to reduce from sixteen\nto twelve for next session. It is\nhoped the extra places generated\nwill be sufficient to avoid cutting\nthe, already very low, number of\nhome postgraduates who can be\noffered places.\nEvelyn Gardens\nDespite the problems caused by\nbeing compelled to carry out\nwork on Willis Jackson House\nduring term-time (reported in\nlast week's FELIX), the College\nis not planning to carry out\nsimilar work on the remaining\nhouses which will be required by\nKensington and Chelsea Council\nuntil it is again forced to do so.\nAfter inspections by the\nCouncil last year a notice was\nserved for work to start on 69 and\n64 to 66 Evelyn Gardens.\nHowever, since all the Evelyn\nGardens houses are in a similar\ncondition it seems that in due\ncourse all will require\nimprove m nts.

John\nNiland, from Essex University,\ndescribed the history of his party\nfrom the early 1900s until the\npresent day. In the early sixties,\nhe said, the policy of Sinn Fein\nhad been revised from a generalised nationalism to a' stat is t' one, which visualise d three stages in the future of the\nIrish peoples.\nFirst, the Northern Irish\nworking class would be\nmobilised by 'civil rights action',\nhe said, and a similar process\nwould follow in the Republic.\nFinally, because the workers of\nNorth and South would be\nunited, the bourgeois capitalist,\nwhom Mr Niland said were\ncontrolling the public, would be\noverthrown.\nHe maintained that the current\ntroubles are due to discrimination against Catholic Nationalists in the North,\nespecially in housing and\npolitical representation, and\nwere triggered by the RUC\nremoving a Republican flag from\na Nationalist meeting in\nNorthern Ireland. He went on to\ndescribe the IRA in conjunction\nwith the people 'on the streets'\nperforming a 'police' role in\nkeeping the B Specials and the\nBritish Army out of the\nNationalist ghetto areas.\nForty-five students were\npre se 'nt at the meeting, including\nsome from other colleges.\nCollege security chief Geoffery\nReeves was said to be annoyed\nyesterday that posters\nadvertising the meeting had been\non show to the general public on\nExhibiton Road and Prince\nConsort Road.\nPhones fiasco\nThe new College electronic\ntelephone exchange developed a major fault this week, making\noutside calls impossible from\nmost instruments.\nCallers had to route urgent\ncalls through the switchboard,\nleading to extensive delays in\nanswering incoming calls.\nEngineers hope to rectify the\nerror 'as soon as possible'.\nRCS Rag Mag success\nRag Mag sellers who raised \u00a31800 last weekend -full story page 3,\nFree!

    "content": "FEATURED\nBookstall\nAs you may have noticed the Christian\nUnion is running a books tr all in the JCR,\nSherfield at lunchtimes each day this term.\nThis aims to provide general information\n(what's on guide, FELIX, bus-maps, details\nof our CU meetings etc) and Christian\nliterature that is not generally available in\nthe Bookshop.\nWe hope to supply books that describe\nthe basics of the Christian faith and the\nreality of God, together with\nautobiographies and those which deal with\nspecific and rel event issues - social, political\nand religious. In connection with the\nlunchtime discussions we hope that we can\nmake available books which give a Christian\nperspective and wider on the topics of\nabortion and clinical experimentation, the\noccult and on Northern Ireland (available\nnearer to the meeting-event in ques it on). For overseas students there are a number\nof publications in different languages and\nsimilar material can be obtained in most\nlanguages if required. Please ask.\nAside from the books it will provide an\nopportunity to meet and discuss question\nand or queries of those Christians on the\nstall. Any suggestions of how to improve the\nbooks tall as a service to students would be\nvery welcome.\nOverseas\nWe are instructed in the Bible to pray for\ngovernment and all those in authority, that\nwe may live in peace. A small group within\nthe Christian Union have taken this to heart\nand meet once a week to pray for the nations\nof the world. We also pray for missions and\nnational church work. We have a particular\nconcern for Africa and Eastern Europe at\npresent as some of the group were born in\nthese areas and others have visited there.\nWe are able to supply Christian literature\nin most languages to anyone who is\ninterested. Do ask.\nOverseas group presently meets each\nTuesday in the Green Committee room in\nthe Union Building. If you are interested in\nthe groups concerns and would like to take\nan active participation then contact either\nCheryl Howard-Gibbons (Botany 3) or Nick\nGardiner (Civ Eng 1).\nThe Eighties\nThe first four years of this decade have seen\nmany important moral and political debates\ngrow and flourish with little hope of early or\npeaceful settlements. As Christians we\nbelieve our faith is directly relevant to the\nissues that cont ant ly fill the front-pages of\nour newspapers, and that perhaps in this\nradically alternative lifestyle based on a belief\nand dependance on a loving God lies the very\nreal possibility of a solution that will bring\nabout the recon c il ation of men.\nBy the time you read this article the first of\na short series of lunch-talks will have taken\n1 lace. This first one will have taken a look at\nthe controversial Government paper 'The\nWarnock Report', considering the\nimplications of the Warnock Committees'\nsuggestions. The area of experimentation on\nlive, human embryos alone raises serious\nmoral questions and ones that MPs will have\nto face and debate when Enoch Powell's 'The\nUnborn Children Protection Bill' receives its\nsecond reading in three weeks time. The\nlunchtime talks will include a buffet lunch and\na talk given by an invited speaker who will\ngive a Christian perspective to the topic in\nquestion. After this talk there will be\nopportunity for questions and discussion in\nan informal atmosphere.\nFuture meeting hope to look at such topics\nas the Occult (Feb 2.1) and Northern Ireland\n(March 7). Details of these and other events\nwill be available shortly \u2014 or for further\ninformation about any of these meeting then\ncontact either Mark Mabin, Elec Eng 1 or\nPaul Townsend , Chem 1.\nEcumenical\nCONTACT WEEK FEB 4-8\nJust a brief mention to look out for details of\nthis week-long event run jointly by the\nCollege Christian societies and to encourage\nyou to get involved in some way. There are\nmany various and interesting discussion\ngroups running each lunch-time together\nwith evening 'so i rees' organised mostly on a hall/house basis. An ideal opportunity to\nmeet with people and to share your view on\nthe many social and even political problems\nthere are together with religious idea logie s. The week is opened on Saturday the 2\nFebruary with a meeting addressed by\nCardinal Hume.\nSpring Term Programme\nJan 25 - A 'Celebration' - prayer and praise with an invitation to all Christian Societies as\nwell as the rest of College: Consort Gallery, SherfieldS.OOpm (Supper inc).\nFeb 1 - 'Prayer and Fasting' (speaker meeting)\nFeb 8 - 'Contact Week Party' brings to an end on a lighter note a week full of discussion.\nFeb 15 'The Great Commission' - taken by student members of the CU.\nFeb 22 - 'Salvation' (speaker meeting)\nMar 1 - The Christian Message' - a chance to hear the message of the Christian Gospel\npresented through song and drama and an informal address given by a local curate,\n(speaker meeting)\nMar 8 - 'The Second Coming' (Speaker meeting)\nMar 15 - Lead by some members of the CU.\nMar 22 - 'End of term party'guaranteed to be something 'different' - but fun. THE\nWARNOCK\\\nREPORT\nCONCERT HALL\nLUNCH\nPROVIDED\n...One of the events organised by the CU\nthat considers issues of the eighties.\nFriday,\nFridayI\nProbably the focal point of the Christian\nUnion's week is the regular Friday evening\nmeeting. Then members can come together\nin the relaxed and informal surroundings of\n53 Prince's Gate (opposite the Mech Eng\nbuilding in Exhibition Road). This is an\ninvaluable time for chatting and sharing\nexperiences over a cup of coffee-especially\nwith people from so many different\nbackgrounds. The main feature of this\nevening is the time of worship when we offer\nto God our thanks and praise and allow\nourselves to be filled with his love and power. Often this time is followed by a short talk\nfrom a visiting speaker. This term the topics\nunder discussion fall under the general title\nof 'What Jesus had to say about..', looking at\nvarious issues concerning our faith and\nchallenging us as to whether we are living as\nJesus expected us to.\nAfter a break for coffee we come together\nagain this time primarily for prayer - prayer\nspecifically for each other - to heal those\nwho are sick, to encourage those who are\ndown hearted and empower each of its in\nthe work that we do by the power of the Holy\nSpirit.\nThese meeting are free and open for\nanyone to attend. We begin at 6.00pm for\n6.30pm with coffee and break at about\n8.00pm. This term's programme is printed\nbelow (a programme card is available from\nmost CU members) or if you have any\nenquiries then see Richard McCallum,\n-'la ry19857 "
