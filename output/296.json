A letter had been\nreceived about Oxfam collections in local pubs and\nanother bringing notice of an\nanti-apartheid petition, which\ncould be signed by members\nof the union.\nAt1.10 p.m., Ken Weale\nhad not arrived to give the\nannual union accounts, so\nGeoff moved the meeting onto the first motion. This\nwas proposed by George\nAssimakis; \"No resident\nshould ever be punished for\nnot informing the Warden of\nan offence that another resident has committed.\" A logical and humanitarian argument put most of the meeting\non George's side, and the\nmotion was passed over-w helm ingly. Accounts\nAfter a general acceptance\nfrom the floor, Ken Weale\nwent on to present the union accounts. The Union has\na cash balance of just over\n\u00a31,000, \u00a312,000 in negotiable\nassets and total assets of approximately \u00a331,000. Further details and a breakdown of last year's income\nand expenses are posted up\naround the college. The\nonly query was from Ken\nHeron who was concerned\nthat \u00a3229 was spent in sending delegates to N.U.S. conference Dave Hobman\nanswered that if people\nweren't sent then we were\nwasting our time being\nmembers of the NUS.\nPiers\nSecond motion to be presented was one from Piers\nCorbyn; an incredibly long\nand diverse motion supporting the Dec 8th strike. Terry\nStephenson immediately proposed that the motion be not\nput. Geoff asked Piers to substantiate the motion which\nhe did so, and the chair decided that the motion was\nto be put. After Piers'\nlengthy proposal, John Mc Cullough suggested that the\nmotion be taken in three\nparts concerning (1) ICU declares support (2) Vicious\nattack on British workers\n(3) Students strike.\nLost\nProperty\nMany items of property,\nsome fairly valuable, are\nhanded into the security\noffice after having been\nfound on the College cam-pus. Many such items are\nnot claimed by the losers\nand are eventually returned\nto the persons who found\nthem. Any student or member of staff losing property\nshould contact the security\noffice, room 163 College\nBlock (ext n.2741). Carnival Walk\nThis year's26 mile round\ntrip via Harrow took place\non the night/morning of\n27th/28 th November. 150\nintrepid walkers did a great\njob, collecting just over\n\u00a31,050 for Carnival, and a few blisters for themselves\ninto the bargain.\nNow, to continue this success, I ask all walkers to read\ntheir Walk Sheet 3 and send\nus a cheque or postal order\nfor the sum for which they\nwere sponsored BEFORE the end of term (pre-dated\nto the beginning of next\nterm if need be) and made\npayable to \"Imperial College Carnival Account\".\nCheques or postal orders\ncan be handed in at the Carnival Office (by steps near\nUnion Bar), and Constituent\nCollege Union Office, I.C.

Harry Fairbrother, head of the TU in\nthe college, spoke on the\nmotion and showed that he\nwas in favour of taking the\nmotion in parts. Support the\nfirst part, he said, and then\ndecide for yourself. But confusion over the various parts\nreduced the meeting to a mak is speaks\nshambles, one that was never\nreally put in order. A call\nwas made for a proper bal-lot; the chairman was forced\nto organise a vote to suspend\nstanding orders and the ballot was thrown out.

    "content": "Page 2 FELIX Thursday, December 10, 1970\nREFECTORY The St. Mungo Community\nTROUBLE?\nThe Rector's special review of Refectories last Friday was not so much of a review of services as a dis-cuss on of the sudden and\nunexpected financial crisis\nfacing the Refectories.\nThe 15% price increase\nat the start of term has already been absorbed by a steep increase in food prices,\nand the Refectories are now\nrunning ait a loss, estimated as amounting ito\n\u00a310,000 over the coming\nyear. The Rector announced\nthat the College (and the\nUGC!!) could not tolerate\nanother loss of the magnitude of last year's whacking\n\u00a328,000.\nMr. Mooney said that\ndespite attempts to improve\nthe efficiency of the Refectories, and bulk food buying\nin co-operation with other\nLondon Colleges, the only\nalternatives he could see\nwere either to increase prices\nby 5% or else close the\nUnion cafeteria and / or\nSouthside Staff Dining Room\n(though he later said that in\nhis opinion ALL the Refectories were needed).\nAfter nearly two hours\ndiscussion, the meeting got\nnowhere, and the Rector\nsaid that much though everyone disliked the idea, and\nunpopular though it would\nbe, he could see no alternative at present to a price in-crease. He asked everyone\nto think of ways to avoid\nthis before his next special\nmeeting next term.\nNo doubt many of you who were here last year will remember the centre page spreads in Sennet and suchlike pub li city, given to the St. Mungo Community. (For those w| hoi\ndon't know, this is an organisation that provides a form of\nsocial contact with the 'dos ser' of London, the old man or\nwoman that you will see sleeping on a bench in a park, \\pr\nrummaging around in the dustbin looking for something to\neat). What has been happening since then?\nIn the first instance the size of the community has trebled,\nthere is a regular soup run to the East End as well as to the\nWest End and Charing Cross embankment, and there are now\nfour houses to provide accommodation of sorts to a few of\nthose found on the soup run. A shop selling second-hand\ngoods (a la Oxfam) has been opened up ait 300 'Battersea\nPark Road.\nIt is now envisaged to conduct a thorough survey of the\nSouthwark area to find out just how many people there are\nsleeping rough. This will entail a detailed search of all the\nderelict buildings in the area, carting off the seriously ill to\nhospital and informing the police of any corpses that we find.\nThe essentially brief meetings on the soup run cannot form\nsufficient contact to influence the most isolated down-and-outs, those who have succumbed to utter hopelessness. To\ncater for this group an all night shelter is to be opened.\nNow we come to the nitty-gritty of this article. Although\nthe actual soup run is fully manned, there is a vast number\nof auxiliary jobs that need to be done that are being neglected due to lack of manpower. These jobs include collecting\ncoffee cups, shoes and old clothes, mending large tears in these\nclothes, going tin-rattling in the pubs and so on. We have\nsome help from Maria Assumpta, but there is still a lot to\ndo. If you feel that you would be interested in partaking in\nany of this, whether lor an hour per week or a day per week,\nthen please contact me as soon as possible, further details\nwill be given without any obligation on your part.\nOn Tuesday, December 8th, at 6.00 p.m. in EE408, the\n'World in Action' film of the St. Mungo Community will be\nshown. This will be followed by coffee and general chit-chat\nwith St. Mungo and I.C. social workers in the Elec. Eng.\nSenior Common Room (EE606). Please make an effort to\ncome and see the film, with friend(s) if possible, even if you\ndecide that you cannot afford the time to take a real part in\nthe Community organisation, just the seeing of the film will\npoint out al dt about this land fit for here os to live in' of\nwhich you were probably unaware.\nBrian Hains\nNews in Brief\never a righting system was\nproduced from cooking oil\nand py jama cord, and only\ntwice the amount of food\nwas dropped on the floor.\nWHO\nis alive and well\nbut still wants\nmore recruits.\nApply union rack.\nAt last, forward looking\nItalian architect and impresario Otto von Clap, has released his comprehensive\nplan for the new Northside.\nHere superimposed upon\nhow the sight will look after\ndemolition is an artist's impression of this stunning\nbuilding.

However not\nonly good results should be reported but also the many un-rewarded efforts of so many people that go on every week.\nLast week's B.U.S. F.

Still, such is competitive sport with its\npeaks of heady glory and depths of' bitter disappointment.\nIn contrast of fierce competition, I must mention the\n2 constituent college Rugby Seven-a side competitions which\nhave been held on the previous two Sundays. In the C+G sevens, Chem Eng III took the First Cup (and 8 galls\nof beer!) and the result of the RCS Sevens were not available at the time of going to press.

He also starred as\nSuperintendent Nicholson in the stage version of 'Ned Kelly'.\nHe doesn't approve of audience participation and thinks it\nis a passing phase; a well constructed play has and always\nwill have more effect than stray actors making lines (he's obviously been to R.C.S. Smoking Concert).\nAt the moment the Studio is working on 'Bar in Tokyo\nHotel', a slapstick tragedy by Tennessee Williams. The students at this institution come from all over the world, from\nvery different backgrounds and have to withstand the rigorous training they get in Classical Technique, improvisation,\nthe study of Classic roles, movement and speech control. It\nis a three year course they have to do and are expected to\nappear on stage right from the beginning, together with professional actors. They realise that the profession is overcrowded and that the cost of running a theatre is higher than\never. But they are not worried about this and don't think\nthere will ever be a drift away from the theatre.\nMr. Henderson and colleague.\nInside the Pheasantry . . .\nThe interview came to an abrupt halt at 5.20 p.m.... The Pheasantry Club\nThis club is located centrally on Kings Road and as its\nlocation suggests, it caters mainly for 'trendies'. It is a disco-the que, but a restaurant and bar facilities are available at\n\"reasonable\" prices.\nMr. Sam David is the manager and makes no bones about\nthe fact that he is in the business only for the money, and has\nforegone pleasantry to this end. The decor is reminiscent of a bomb shelter and no attempts are made at hospitality: just\na brusque and impersonal greeting as they pocket your\nmoney.\nDespite the fact that it is a discotheque, live groups are\noften featured. Music-lovers note that the music played is\nteeny bop perish to the extreme and 'heavy' sounds are not\nfeatured. Jazz or folksongs are sometimes played.\nIf any unruly or troublesome behaviour breaks out the\nfuzz are immediately summoned; no shadows of bouncers\nmar this convivial scene. \"There have been no fights here\n(touch wood) for the past two years.\" This lack of unruly\nbehaviour is probably due to the fact that applicants for\nmembership are scrutinised before they are bestowed this\nhonour. They are then subject to a membership fee of 4 gn s., and pay 10s. entrance for every visit. They can then enjoy\nthe wonderful music, bar facilities (double whiskey lis.) and\nthe restaurant (six oysters for 12/6) with its attractive wait-res ses, up to 2 a.m. Mr. Sam David escorted us round the establishment which\nwas rather deserted on a Tuesday night (\"it is very crowded\non weekends\"). This bearded gentleman with a foreign accent\nwas always the businessman who remarked about the reason-Shekhar (right) in the projector room\n. . . and one of the waitresses\nable ness of his prices and how much better his establishment\nwas compared to others. (No\u2014he was not an East African\nJew!). His act of the professional charmer had procured\nover one thousand members and he left it to them to perpetuate the club and did not believe in advertising.\nThe Kensington Odeon\nThis cinema on High Street Ken is not just a place for a quiet s nog with your girlfriend (boundary conditions); it is an\ninstitution. Most Kensington residents regard it as their own\nlocal cinema from the local shopkeepers and students right up\nto the top brass in the film world including the director of\nRank Organisation. (Soc Soccers note).\nBut this institution is coming down! Though renovated\nonly six to seven years ago a plan exists to tear down it ha whole ka boodle and build a new hotel, with two cinemas.\nThis might offer more choice of viewing but in the years it\nwill take to build this rather ambitious structure (if one\nknows the British Workman) the people will be left with no\ncinema at all.\nMr. Pearce, the manager, seems rather saddened at this\nprospect as he has become rather attached to the place, but\nsheer business sense must override sentiment. After all, the\nforecourt alone is worth \u00a3100,000 and in these days when\nreal estate in the city is at a premium we must step aside for\nprogress.\nA tall, genial family man with three children, Mr. Pearce\nhas been in the cinema for 30 years\u2014three years at the Ken.\nOdeon. He started off playing the organ at what the Americans call a nick le odeon. After the war it was suggested that\norgan players actually kept people away and the practice de-c lined. He then turned to management and hasn't looked\nback since.\nThe two principal releases in this country are made by\nRank and ABC each week. These are circulated in North\nLondon, then the South, and finally all over the country. The\ntrend these days is to show historical films, although a few\nfilms about American youth are doing commercially well at\nthe moment. The manager doesn't have much say in the\nchoice of films he shows, but what he does have is freedom\nin the choice of films for special presentation. The Kensington Odeon has been showing a few old films for a one day\nrun between major releases and these have proven to be very\nsuccessful.\nThere is very little contact between the Censor Board and\nthe managers. It is usually the film-makers who are interested in this curious body. The secretary of the board, John\nTrevelyan is considered to be THE CENSOR, although the\nname Lord Harlech is familiar to everyone.\nMr. Wheeler is the projection manager and certainly knows\nhis job. He clued us in on the physical principles used in the\nmaking of projectors as well as the transformation the projector room has gone through in four decades. This information was well spiced with good humour, which gave him a head start on any of our lecturers.\n\n"

LISTEN TO IT\u2014I can't really do it justice.\nSide one has three tracks\neach emphasizing one member of the group although\nEmerson is plainly evident\non all three. Side two begins\nwith some dramatic work on\nthe Royal Festival Organ\nby Emerson who then flips\nthrough some brilliant piano\nplaying to a track called\nTank. This track is good\u2014I played it at a disco the day\nit was released and people\ngot so involved with it they\neven danced with it.\nThe whole album is one\nof involvement; subtle, persuasive with sudden excite-ment, the music absolutely\nrefuses to be ignored.\nKeith Emerson was asked\n(why the Nice split up. 'Be-cause on 'Five Bridges\nSuite' we had gone as far\nas we could.' Well O.K. but\non this album Emerson has\nboth gone back a way and\nforward again to reach new\nheights. With Greg Lake on\n,bass (ex King Crimson) and\nCarl Palmer (ex Atomic\nRooster and Crazy World\nof Arthur Brown) Keith\nEmerson has produced a startling new album with\nthe influence of the Nice\nshowing only sub t ely. There\nare only a few well placed\nAND FILMS electronic gimmicks like\noccasional drum phasing and\na Moog synthesis er; and the\nvocals are rare, which perhaps is as well since they\ntend to be weak.\nIt has been said (Island\npress release) that 'Emerson,\nLake and Palmer are potentially the most important\ngroup to emerge in the world\nthis year'. I agree, they certainly have the potential,\nbetween them they play or-gan, piano, bass, guitar,\ndrums, Moog and an assortment of other noise and\nrhythm makers. I hope all\nthe potential hasn't yet been\nfully realized, the second\n.album is already planned,\nJ for one will be waiting for\nit.\nFigures, Scrooge\nand the LFF.\nJoseph Losey has not fared well with film distributors recently. \"Secret Ceremony\" was well received, but hardly found its way out of London. The American\ndistributor apparently thought it too ambiguous for the audiences there, and accomplished a mixture of surgery and addition. Losey's work is not the only to suffer in\nthe USA. Peter Hall's \"Three Into Two Won't Go\"'... had ambiguities about Miss\nGeeson's character and motivation . . . clarified for TV audiences in a prologue in\nwhich officials explain why they are looking for the girl.'\nIt seems surprising that the film makers seldom have much say over alterations\nto their finished work. Joe Losey describes film direction as 'total freedom to make\nsomething for someone else to destroy', but he should be better treated with his latest\nfilm, \"FIGURES IN A LANDSCAPE\" which opened in London recently. Barry\nEngland's novel, on which it is based, tells of the desperate flight of two escaped\nprisoners-of-war\" across 400 miles of alien territory. The chief menace is a helicopter,\nseldom far away, directing their pursuers ever nearer, the pilot playing a brutal and\ncynical game as the helicopter swoops low like a mechanical bird of prey whose only\ninterest is to harass.\nIn the film the two fugitives, Ansell and MacConnachie are played by Malcolm\nMcDowell, who previously appeared in \"If . . .\", and Robert Shaw, who also adapted\nthe book for the screen. Losey thought the book's ending, in suicide just before inevitable capture, 'unduly pessimistic\u2014such a film would be futile' and the film ends\nin AnselPs escape over the friendly border as MacConnachie, overcome with hatred,\nturns back to shoot at the approaching helicopter; shots where the reply is his death.\nThe tension achieved in the book, and the film, largely derives from the lack of\nspecified cause, time and place. If anything, the film seemed to give away a little\nmore, and perhaps this contributed to the screenplay's often falling short of the book's intensity. However, the menace of the helicopter, sometimes observed from within, but\nmore often from the perspective of the fugitives, is superbly captured. One can only\nadmire the actors' nerve during the shooting of scenes in which their fear could hardly\nhave been much less than quite genuine.\nThe LONDON FILM FESTIVAL is something of a model film festival. Ticket\nprices, at 10/-, are favourable compared with West End cinemas. It is far from a black\ntie scene, selection of films is unrelated to national quotas or likewise irrelevant cri-teri a, and it is non-competitive. Thus, from its inception 13 years ago it has avoided\nthe eruptions and accusations of festivals elsewhere.\nThis year's festival, which finished last week seems to be well up to par. For the\ncinema-goer it is a chance to see what is usually the first screening of a film in London,\nand one may often wait a year or more before further public screening. Unfortunately\nwith so many films concentrated into only a fortnight, one can only sample.\n\"DEEP END\", an English film by Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski, reminded\nme of \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\". It too is about the problems of growing out of adolescence, and is quite engaging. The humour and confident progression\nof the story should assure its release, and it's well worth looking out for\n\"QUIET DAYS IN CLICHY\" has already been refused a certificate by the BB FC and hopes of a GLC licence seem improbable. Hence you're unlikely to see this adaptation of the story by Henry Miller except on the club and film society circuit. The\nlechery of Joey, Miller's self portrait, and Carl in Paris, accompanied by the apt music\nand lyrics of Country Joe, and, apart from Joey, handicapped by generally poor and\ncontrived acting, is shown without the slightest regard to sensibilities and decorum. This\nis a film to disturb the squeamish and to outrage Mrs. Tilney and fellow travellers. Often\ndisjointed, and perhaps overlong, nevertheless a blue movie with artistic merit!\nWhilst the London Film Festival is a forum where distributors can look out for\nfilms they think potentially profitable (however exasperating their frequent myopia regarding the market), there are some films which presumably can't go wrong in the box\noffice. \"SCROOGE\", obviously released as a pantomime-substitute, based on Dickens'\n\" A Christmas Carol\", is such a candidate. Rifi reports that, unlike many musicals in\nwhich dialogue and set-piece songs form a hapless concoction, the screen-play and\ndirection of \"Scrooge\" have led to an excellent integration of the spoken and sung.\nAlbert Finney, in the title role, should receive special praise, promulgating the discovery that the actor with restricted singing ability will often give the more convincing\ncharacter is ation. Rifi also mentions the excellent portrayals by Edith Evans, as the\nGhost of Christmas Past, David Collings as Bob Cratchit and Richard Beaumont as\nTiny Tim, but found Kenneth More's Ghost of Christmas Present disappointing.\nJOHN ACKERS\nSANTANA ABRAXA\n(CBS 64087) i If you haven't turned on\nto, got in to, or heard Santana yet, you are badly missing out. Their first album\ncame out a year ago and was\nheld as a priceless possession\nby its owners at that time;\nthe second album is as good.\nIt's not the same yet it's not\nentirely different, it's not\nbetter, it is certainly not\nworse. Whereas on their first\nalbum Santana seemed to be\nintroducing a new sound to\nRock, they now seem to be\nintroducing a new atmosphere. Some of the tracks, particularly 'singing sind s, crying beasts' seem to pervade\nthe room and your mind with\nthe gentleness and peace of\n.a warm summer's day on\nthe beach, but all the time\n/with an underlying menace\nmaintaining excitement and\ninterest. Some of the tracks\nare straight Latin jazz/Rock\nlike the first album but\nagain\u2014with something else\natmospheric, intangible almost ethereal, added.\nMuchly recommended al-bum.\nI don't enjoy reviewing\ngood albums\u2014prefer just\nlistening to them\u2014so we repeat last week's invite\u2014come\nup and listen to the music\u2014\neither 577 Selkirk or at Disco\nT or OCTOPUS SOUNDS\nINC. playing in and around\ncollege.\nNow by way of a change\n\u2014here are some quick reviews of recent bad records.\nMelanie\u2014Ruby Tuesday\u2014\npretentious rubbish.\nFree>\u2014The Stealer\u2014ridiculously unoriginal.\nDave Edmond\u2014I hear\nyou knocking\u2014boring.\nMost the Hoople\u2014Mad\nShadows \u2014 Don't know,\nhaven't heard it yet.\nNeil Young\u2014After the\nGold Rush \u2014 heard one\ntrack, heard it all.\nPink Floyd\u2014Atom Heart\nMother\u2014sounded like I need\na new stylus.\nCurved Air\u2014Air Conditioning\u2014I did need a new\nstylus.\nVoices of East Harlem\u2014\ndidn't even bother looking\nat the title.\nSome girl came up to the\nDisco last week and said\n'Have you got Clarence\nCarter\u2014Patches?'\n'No' I said.\n'Thank God' she said.\nMore next issue,\nCHRIS AND T IM.P.S.

We were, to say the least, disturbed by recent developments in Imperial College. Both as\nrecent graduates and taxpayers, we felt it to be our duty to\nbeg the courtesy of your columns to make certain timely\ncomments upon the current distressing state of affairs.\nWe would like to remind Mr. Cooke that the student union\nfees are provided by the taxpayer. Is it, then, too much to ask\nthat the taxpayer should have a voice in the use of this\nmoney, which Mr. Cooke seems to regard as his?\nDoes he seriously think that we pay our taxes solely for\nthe entertainment of students? No, we pay student grants in\nthe hope of achieving some benefit for the nation (and, in-deed, the empire) thereby. In our day, students were in the\nforefront of the struggle for freedom, equality and democracy\nat home and abroad. Where are they now? They are in industry earning money so that the struggle can continue via\npo licit al work on all fronts.\nWe pay our taxes, we pay your grants, why aren't you\nbloody well out on the streets, demonstrating? Ah, that it\nshould come to this!\nWe remain,\nYours etc.,\nJ. Martin Bland, M. Sc, D.I.C., A.R.C.S., F. S.S.D. V. Wield, B. Sc., A.R.C.S., Grad. Inst. P.,O. B.E.( failed)\nor burning.\nSir,\nUnder the heading 'the cultural revolution' the writer\nmakes some comment about students despairing at voting a lefty back for a second year. This is certainly not true. The\nR.C.S. president is merely airing his own opinion (and perhaps his cronies' too). However he may rest assured that noone in his right mind would ever vote the present R.C.S. president back to his useless post for a second year. He also\nmakes it clear that he is not as concerned about the mental\nstate of the student here, as he, is about the reputation of\nthe college abroad. It is a shame he couldn't make it to\nOxford or some such 'reputable' place, but then I suppose\nsomeone with his selfish attitudes shouldn't expect any better.\nPerhaps he needs a' revive r' of some sort. It is painfully obvious that he is politically impotent; the potential of the\ncollege as apo licit al hammer to straighten out kinks in the\nsystem must be realised and not scorned at.\nIt is our duty as the 'educated' minority in society to assist\nin correcting political issues if they are morally wrong. The\nI.C. Union does not exist for the students entertainment\u2014\nthat's what the constituent college unions are there for.\nThe writer also seems incredibly ignorant about the N.U.S. If he ever bothers to read 'Times Educational Supplement',\nhe will find that the name Jack Straw is rather well known\nby people actually interested in education. Jack Straw's ideas\non reform in the educational and political sphere are respected and respect is something Steve Cooke will never get\non the R.C.S. stage.\nYours faithfully,\nRify Abdulla\nLAMLEY'SAM LEY for your\u2014\nBOOKS\nAKT MATERIALS\nPAPER BACKS\nSTATIONERY\nrem on R0AO, S.W.7 Are you interested in\nbooks by:\u2014\nJoseph |-|eller\nEdward ^Ibee\nJohn Le Carre\nRonald Qahl\nJohn Arden Harold Nicholson\nGavin gwar t Get them from the\nHaldane Library\nLevel 2, Library Block\nOpen Mon. to Fri. 10\u20145.30\nDear Sir,\nI am an atheist and there-fore, presumably, one of the\npeople the recent 'One Way'\ncampaign has been aimed at.\nThe following comments are\nby way of a constructive\ncriticism to enable any future\nefforts along the same lines\nto be more effective and less\noffensive.\nLeaving aside for a moment the philosophy\nguiding the campaign, the\npublicity side of it, which is\nboth the first and in many\ncases the only contact made\nwith the student body, was\nless than totally professional.\nThis would not matter so\nmuch were it not that the\ncampaign was obviously setting itself high standards\n(worthy of printed posters,\nfor instance). But while we\nwere assailed from all sides\nwith these neat, expensive\npictures, the actual content\nwas doubtful. 'One Way'? A neat gimmick; one hopes.\nAnd is it really intelligent to\nexpect non-believers to be\n'enlightened' by quotes from\na book of sectarian gospels\nthey have already rejected?\nThen there was the alienation\nproduced by excessive pub li city, which I.C.C. U. must\nhave realised by the end.\nNext time, less and better\nplease.\nThe choice of 'One Way' as\nthe theme may not have been\nvery good. I accept (reluctantly) that some people are\nnot only sure that their way\nis the only one way, but that\nthey have a duty to convert\nothers to it. Blandly stating\nthat they have the key to all\nunfathomable mysteries, and\nthat all other claims to this\nare false, with all the Calvinistic fire and brimstone that\nthis implies, will appear to\nthe infidel as unspeakable ar-rogan ce. When persuading, it\nhelps if you appreciate the\nopponent's own views, even\n\u2014dare I suggest it\u2014to the\nextent of conceding that there\nmay be something in them.\nI remain, Sir, res peet f ul of\nthe personal beliefs of others,\nP. Lee,\nDept. of Computing &\nControl.\nMADNESS Dear Sir,\nWithout doubt many of\nyour readers will have been\nnauseated by the spurious,\nand totally unscientific, racial\nviews expressed by B. Hollins in the last edition of\nFELIX. Many will have been\nreminded by his perverted\nreasoning of Hitler's views,\nequally unscientific, about\nAryan superiority. At best\nHollins' abbe rations can be\ndescribed as a form of mad-ness.\nOf more interest must be\nthe question of how your\ncorrespondent could have\nbeen reduced to such a level.\nI would dare to suggest he is\nthe victim of false ideologies\nwhich are coming increasingly into vogue in this country.\nTwo such ideologies were\nwell presented in the same\nissue of your paper. The\nmaterialist idea that money\nis the only thing of value in\nthis world and that personal\nrelationships should be ruled\nby financial considerations, a view vital to the survival of\ntechnological capitalism, was\npersuasively peddled by\nSteve Cooke in his 'Cultural\nRevolution.\" The second pre-sent ation, although obviously\nwell meant may be equally as\ndamaging. Geoff Needham\nis obviously sincere in his\n' A Humanist Point of View'\nbut could it be that nega t iv ism often to be found in British Humanism has undermined the Christian ethic. In\nparticular the Christian belief that all men are equal in\nthe sight of God is a powerful corrective to the madness\nof Mr. Hollins' pr p* apartheid group, who seem to\nregard one group of men as\njust a particularly useful species of animal.\nYours faithfully,\nLes Ebdon,\nChem. P.G. SUBLIME Dear Sir,\nMr. Hollins' letter in the\nlast issue of FELIX was definitely the creation of a sublime intellect. The brilliant\nlogic much in evidence\nthroughout this circumspect\nand right-minded analysis defies description. His well substantiated statements especially those about 'Satchmo'\nand 'Indian hockey teams' as\nwell as poignant analogies\nabout lions and zebras' added spice to the missive. The\nlanguage was rather zest y throughout and clumsy\nphraseology and inept pu c tu ation cleverly avoided. After\nall, every war in history (ex-ce pt Civil ones) have been\nforeigners fighting people.\nIf I was the editor of\nFELIX, I would certainly\nagitate to get this perspicacious gentleman to edit a regular column entitled\n'Racism can be Fun' (but\nsurely our imaginative friend\ncould think up a better\ntitle).\nSigned,\nBulldog van Grote\nEDITORIAL\nDespite difficulties and crises met daily by FELIX staff, we're\nstill here, returning this issue with stacks of free gifts and goodies.\nI trust these will warm the hearts of (those Who have recently\nheld a lot of criticism for the paper. And here, for all to see, is\na potted defence of this issue:\u2014\n(1) Why is there so much space devoted to Carnival? (a) Carnival\nis one of the few \"good\" Causes alive in the 'College (besides OSS),\n(lb) it can involve everyone in the College, (c) Carnival realise\nthe value of publicity, and consequently make sure we get plenty\nof material.\n(2) Why is there so much free gung e and so little news? It's Christmas and nothing's happened.\nBack to reality, the editor welcomes any constructive criticisms,\nschemes to improve and change FELIX. Did you think the front\npage of this issue was a good idea, for example? I may be contacted at 432 Tizard or at any press meeting, but please remember\u2014\ntry and keep political dogmatism from spoiling your ideas.\nWhen considered as a whole, last Thursday's Union meeting\naccomplished very little. The effectiveness of such meetings to\ndecide basic issues Which really concern the Union appears to be\nrapidly decreasing. Two thirds of the allotted time was spent discussing a motion which even Piers Corbyn, the proposer, could\nnot 'have thought had a fair chance of being passed. I'n ough l am\nnot speaking against the motion as such, worded as it was, it\nimmediately had an overwhelming block of voters, typified by Terry\nStephenson, against it Between them, they are wasting too much\nof the Union's time.\nlust as effective in disrupting the meeting are characters who\ninsist on shouting for order or propose paper 'ballots, of Which\nthere is surely little point unless personal allegiances are involved.\nThe Constitution and Standing Orders are tools to promote intelligent discussion and should not 'bog us down in time-wasting procedural trivia.\nPARANOIA Dear Sir,\nSpare me space to answer\nyour correspondent B. Hollins letter. On analysing it, I found it to be most illogical\nand seemed to be the work of\na paran oic mind. (I am an\nAston University undergraduate doing my industrial training in London, and in the\npast have written frequent\narticles on racism for the\nUniversity paper, 'The Sun').\nHow can one condone\napartheid when in South\nAfrica as a direct result of\nthis inhumane and diabolical\ndoctrine, 50% of the black\nchildren die before the age of\nfive, and the life expectancy\nof a black African is 34\nyears.\nTo say that whites and\nblacks cannot integrate is\nsheer nonsense. One only has\nto look at Holland where\nthe Dutch have absorbed\n180,000 S.E. Asians (blacks)\ninto their society without the\nemergence of 'Powellism' or\nshould I say 'Hollinism'. To\nquote Julie Tweed of the\nGuardian, who visited Holland, 'In Holland a marriage\nbetween a black and a white\nis a marriage and not an\nintermarriage.'\nHe further argues that\n'whites' are more intelligent\nthan blacks.' This is merely\na racialist clich e \u2014there are\nno statistics available. Unfortunately his paran oic mind fails to grasp the idea\nthat one's I.Q. depends\nlargely on sociological fac-tors, not on the pigmentation\nof one's skin; and furthermore one's pig me nation is\npurely due to geographical\nfactors. To use India as an\nexample to illustrate the\npoint; the Indians living in\nKashmir, where it snows\nvirtually all the year round,\nare as 'white' as Europeans\nif not 'whiter'. In the south\nwhere there is oppressive\nheat all the year round, the\nIndians are very dark.\nIn fact, although Kashmiri's are white, with all respect to them, they are the\ndullest among the Indians\npurely because they shrink\nfrom civilisation. Further it\nwill be valid to assume that\nthe Eskimos in spite of their\nwhite skin will have the same\nI.Q. as the Africans, and an\nAsiatic will have a higher\nI.Q. than them both purely\nbecause of sociological rea-sons. (Just for the record, the\naverage Asiatic brain has\nnineteen million brain cells\nand an average British brain\nhas seventeen million brain\ncells).\nIt is surprising that an I.C. student would have to f aS J back to the absurd clich e 'quite a number among them\nare spongers on society,' because surveys on racism have\nshown this to be a myth.\nFinally with reference to his\nidea of first and second class\ncitizenship, how unfair it\nwould be for two persons\nmaking the same contribution\nto society to be given different status in the same society simply because of their\ncolour.\nThe analogy he uses, 'a lion and a zebra' is absurd. I wonder how violently he\nwould object if he saw a black stallion and a white\nmare copulating. Even if he\nobjected, the white mare\nwouldn't particularly be interested in his 'superior' sense\nof reasoning.\nThe essence of a society\nshould be humanity not apartheid. Yours faithfully,\nJaved S. Khan,\n(University of Aston)\n\n"

Maybe I could con Paul and Andy into helping.\"\n\"Just two points,\" he said, stamping out our names on\nDymo badges. \"Show them the steam engines lab 'cos it's most impressive, and don't over-emphasise the failure rate.\"\nSo, stuffing the remains of the fruit-cake and biscuits\ninto our pockets, we set out on the expedition; first stop the\nsteam engines lab.\n\"See that big thing over there \u2014 that's a boiler. Impressive, isn't it? \"\n\"Yes,\" responded a studious-looking character. \"What's this thing here? \"\n\" Ah, hmm, yes . . . Andy, what's this? \"\n\"Oh, I think it's a turbine.\"\n\"Ah, yes, this is a turbine. Let's go and see something\nelse. I wonder what's through here . . . er, this is the fluids\nlab.\"\nSuddenly I realised I didn't really know the purpose of\nany of the systems of ducts, etc. at which some of the more\nenthusiastic candidates were gazing interested ly. Quickly, we\nhustled them off towards the Applied Mechanics lab. Here\nwas a place I really knew well and could describe in tell i gently. Unfortunately, however, there was already a character\nthere who knew far more about the whole thing than I did,\nand I couldn't really say anything.\nWondering what I had ever learned at this place, I shepherded the herd in the direction of Southside, via the\nUnion office (\"Buy your Carnival tickets here\") and the\nlibrary.\n\"This is the library, which lis supposed to be quiet.\"\n\"Sshhh\".\nArriving at Exhibition Road, the hitherto quiet crowd\nsuddenly burst into a chorus of questions.\n\"Do you have to cross this road all the time? \"\n\"Isn't there a subway? \"\nImportant questions indeed.\n\"This is the South Side Union Building. There's supposed to be a refectory here, but I'm not sure where, because\nit keeps moving about.\"\n\"What's the food like here? \"\n\" Ah, yes, down here is the bar,\" I rushed on, feeling\nthirsty. \"I think we've got time for a quick half. Hands up\nwho wants a drink.\"\nOne tentative hand went up, as I realised that most of\nthe party were probably under 18.\n\"Still half an hour before the interviews. What would\nyou like to see? \"\nNo reply.\n\"Why not show them a typical hall room.\"\n\"Good idea.\"\nJust my luck to encounter the housekeeper as I was\nabout to fit all 14 people into the hall lift! After a brisk walk\nacross Princes Gardens (\"Notice the superb stereo effect.\")\nwe shuffled into the sports centre.\n\"Down here is the swimming pool \u2014 oh no, sorry, it's the weight-training room. I didn't know we had a weight-training room.\"\n\"Oh, yes.\"\nAndy always did know too much.\nAnd so finally, after braving the traffic again, we rolled\nback into the department, ten minutes late due to the clocks\nbeing ten minutes fast, and while I unknowingly ambled off\nto consume the contents of my pocket, Andy proceeded to\nentertain the girlfriend of one of the candidates while he was\naway at the interview.\nSo if you ever wonder next year why there's nobody in\nMech Eng I...

Person to contact - Malcolm Bailey\n- Tizard 434,\nGen. Studs.\nCurrently in progress on Tuesday lunchtimes is a series\nof lectures by Kevin Gough-Yates, of the British Film Institute, on the subject of famous film directors. The approach\nadopted by Mr. Gough-Yates is to let the films speak for\nthemselves as much as possible; two or three selected extracts\nare shown during each talk, the effect of which is to leave\nmost people wishing they could have seen the whole film.\nThe first of the series, on Alfred Hitchcock, was particularly\ninteresting in that the extracts shown were from some very\nearly films, including \"Blackmail\", and the first British-made\n\"talk ie\". The second of the series, on Tuesday 24th, concerned\nJean-Luc Godard, a French director who, although less well-known to the British public, is considered by Mr. GoughYates to be one of the greatest of all. Two clips were shown,\nfrom films made in the early Sixties, revealing Godard's somewhat weird approach to filming \u2014 using available light\nonly whenever possible, including very long takes, etc. I came\nout of the lecture fascinated, but slightly bemused.\nA further series of lectures related to the Cinema has\nbeen given by Kenneth Roland, a director of films on art.\nHis technique in film-making is to include only shots of the\nwork of a particular artist, blending together different works\nto give a \"short\" of 10-40 minutes duration on the work of\nthat artist. The films are accompanied by modern music, but\nMr. Roland prefers to show the extracts in silent form, 'to be\nfair to the composers.'\nThe talks are accompanied by a mixture of rather\nbadly-mounted slides and short film clips, a technique which\ndoes little for Mr. Warner's blood pressure, and tends to lead\nto mishaps and hold-ups. Not recommended as light enter-tain ment, but at least not in French.\nPIER'S PIECE What is the connection between IC's increasing links\nwith industry and the Dec.\n8 National Day of Strike and\nother action by workers and\nstudents against the anti-union laws and the recent\nmini-budget?\nLast issue I showed how\nthe attitudes of the Chieftains of Industry who sit on\nour Governing Body and\nprop o gate their industrial\nlinks moulded the 'hier arch i cal, autocratic, narrow,\nmoney before culture'\nethos of IC.\nThis ethos and these links\n\u2014 in various aspects \u2014\nhave been in Imperial College since its inception in\n1907, but have taken interesting developments in the\nlast two years.\n18 months ago \u2014 when\nthe Parliamentary Select\nCommittee on \"Student\nRelations' visited IC, Lord\nPenney \u2014 Rector \u2014 said he\ndid not want IC to imitate\nindustrial factory type relations and conflicts but preferred to see 'participation'.\nAt the same time he, and\nthe Governing Body, decided to increase IC's links\nwith Industry.\nNot surprisingly, as these\nlinks increased, industrial\nmethods and attitudes have\nbeen increasingly applied in\nIC. Last year a Work Study\n(Speed up) was carried out\non the cleaners, and attempts were made to make\nthem believe it was all because of the Prices and Incomes Board. Now the\ncleaners are unhappy and IC\nis dirty.\nIndustry orientated\ncourses have increased in IC\nand work-load (or 'modern\ndetail') has gone up. An Industrial Liaison Officer was\nappointed; Professors were\nencouraged to take up industrial Directorships and consultant posts. A private company (IC Optical Systems\nLimited, in Physics) has\nbeen set up \u2014 and the profits are being used to line\nthe pockets of various people\n\u2014 instead of for more re-'\nsearch. So these staff and the\nothers who hold directorships and consultant posts\nwill become more profit-motivated and 'buy else-where' rather than 'freely\nseeking after knowledge', or\ngiving you decent lectures.\nRecently a Personnel Secretary (Mr. Malone an ex-NAL GO official) has been\nappointed to confuse and\ndivide the ASTMS, Maintenance Men and Clerical\nWorkers, (who will be encouraged \u2014 it is rumoured\n\u2014 to join NAL GO)... Mr. Malone's stalling and 'con-sul tat ions' might result in a strike soon. The ICRC\n(slandered by Broadshit) is a way we can organise against\nthis 'divide and rule'.\nThe point is all these developments are an inevitable\nresult of the pressures of\nmodern Capitalism (call it\nby something else if you\ncan!) on this College, as are\nthe mini-Budget and the\nanti-union Laws. Who are\nthe Tories after all if not the\nChieftains of Industry (like\nour Governing Body) and\ntheir cronies?\n\n"

SOC Educational Thoughts from Steve Cooke.\n1960's The Educational System of this country is perhaps the\nmain factor in the preservation of our abominable class-system. Born into a working class family and your education\nwill more than likely be primary \u2014 secondary \u2014 leave at\n16 and remain in working class. Born in the upper middle\nclass family and your education will more than likely be private preparatory school \u2014 public school \u2014 University and\nremain in upper middle class. Basically the working class\npupil has a chance to do well by either passing the atrocious\n11 plus (an institution we can well afford to do without) or\nby working very well during the secondary education \u2014 by\nno means an easy task; the private and public school education wins here for no matter how intelligent you are, provided\nyour parents have the money then you can travel the s imp je path up the educational ladder completely avoiding the 11 + .\nHowever the narrow mindedness of the system doesn't end\nhere. It is extremely difficult, in many cases impossible, for\nmiddle aged people to take advanced courses and in fact no\nincentive exists for the average person to leave his job for a year or so to study. Admittedly the Open University may\nbridge this gap a small way but there are many other forms\nof education difficult to receive and then, of course, there's always the financial problem.\nGrants are awarded by Local Educational Authorities for\nstudents on higher educational courses. A simple and good\nidea in theory; however in practice it is largely abused by the\nco-called 'means test'. Under this system the more the parents\nearn the less grant the student receives down to the minimum\n(\u00a350) grant i.e. it is the poor students who can easily survive\neconomically during their course and the students in supposedly 'better off' families that suffer financially because\ntheir parents cannot or will not pay their contribution. The\nstudent is of course perfectly entitled to take his parents to\ncourt to claim their grant contribution, however this could\nlead to family friction!\n1970's So what is to be done far education in the la it e nineteen\nseventies. One thing is certain, a major change to a comprehensive system must and will take place soon. This is* a change for the better but it is not complete as at present\nplanned. The Tory Government have called a temporary\nhalt to this change and now is the time to give it a bit more\nthought. Taking into account that everyone should receive\nthe education that they require and that there should be opportunities for anyone to leave or join the sy tem at will it is\nrelatively easy to see that the simplest form of education\nwould be the following.\nUp to five years old play school would be available for at\nleast two half-day sessions a week. All Monte Sore and pre-.sent play schools and recreational groups would be eligible\nWhat'son? Today, Thursday, 10 December\nDRAM SOC: \"Juno and the Paycock\" by Sean O 'Casey.\n20.00, Concert Hall.

Friday, 25 December\nChristmas (Merry).\nfor grants from the Government. No Fees. Non-compulsory\nattendance.\nSchool level 1. From 5 years onwards until age 13. This\ncourse provides the basic school work as at present but from\nage 11 to 13 academic records of students are kept and depending upon how the student does he will be placed in either\na2 year or a3 year stream to the level 1 examinations (O level). The 3 year stream covers ground in more practical\nsubjects\u2014needlework or metalwork whereas the 2 year\nstream will deal mainly with academic subjects.\nAt completion of this stage the student is free to leave the\nsystem if he so desires i.e. at age 15 or 16 and from this stage\nonwards the system becomes highly flexible. The principal\nidea being that a student would be welcomed to level 2 from\nlevel 1, or after a year V. S.O. say or after 15 years as a lorry\ndriver.\nSchool level 2. Age flexible. Non compulsory attendance.\nNo fees. This is a three year course leading to a secondary\nlevel certificate\u2014obtained on course work on any subject\n(maximum 5). At this stage only students who have done\nsufficiently well at level 2 will be permitted to travel to level\n3. It would be encouraged for a student to do a year or so or\nany length of time in industry or business in the subject he\nintended to pursue at level 3.\nSchool level 3. Age flexible. Non compulsory attendance.\nNo fees. Students at the level 3 educational establishment 'the\ncomprehensive university' would be given a weekly wage of\n\u00a315, out of which they would be expected to pay N.H. Contributions etc., but which is tax-free. Entrance qualification\nwould be a pass at level 2.\nSo where does the money come from? In the long term\nfrom the student as part of income tax there would be educational tax i.e. taxing those students who have lived off\nothers for a certain time this would probably be in the region\nof 6d. in the \u00a31 for level 3 education. In the short term in\naddition to the educational allowance taken out of the income tax it would be necessary to raise taxes or rather sort\ntii em out. Ideally i then tin i mum taxable amount ought to rise\nto at least \u00a3650 and after that rise to a standard tax at level\n\u00a31200 of 9/6 in the pound. This would have little or no effect\non anyone earning up to say \u00a32000 and would add an extra\n\u00a360 to someone earning \u00a33000 and an extra \u00a31000 to someone earning \u00a311000. This would in fact adequately support\nthe system and fairly finance it.\nThis resume has been greatly shortened and I 've had to cut\nsome sections. I hope to cover 'the Comprehensive University'\nin an addition to 'the Cultural Revolution.'\npostman\"3 tft ije psi ut j> ou lint b paper;\ntori tt tr je oilier to ap.\" FABER PRIZE In 1943, Dr. Oscar Faber, OBE, a well known member of\nthe Civil Engineering staff, endowed the Society with a sum\nof \u00a3200 to be invested in trust, the annual interest of which\nwas to provide a prize\u2014to be known as the FABER PRIZE \u2014to be offered annually for the best student paper presented\nbefore the Society.\nThe object of the Prize is to encourage students to take an\nactive interest both in the Engineering Society and in writing\npapers and presenting them before the Society for discussion.\nAt the moment, the annual prize amounts to \u00a38, but the\nwinner also receives the distinction of \" FABER PRIZE MAN\", and this fact is included in the student's academic\nrecord. The winning paper is usually published in \"Spanner\".\nAl members of City and Guilds College Union are invited\nto submit papers which can discuss any subject connected\n(however vaguely) with engineering. For example vacation\ntraining, group or individual projects, and topics prepared\nfor colloquia all make excellent subject material. The paper\nshould be less than 3,000 words, and suitable for presentation in about twenty minutes, as the best three papers will be\npresented at a meeting of the Engineering Society in the\nSpring Term. Entries should be submitted by 5th February,\n1971, to the Chairman, Barry Brooks, Elec. Eng. 3.\nPapers are assessed in two parts:\n(1) for technical content, by the Dean and City and Guilds\nCollege, Prof. A.W. Bishop, PhD, FICE, who will co-opt\nother members of staff as necessary.\n(2) for presentation, by the Society.\nRecent winning titles have been: \"The strength of trees\",\n\"Design of a flying submarine\".\nDo not he st it ate to ask me for further information or\nadvice. BARRY BROOKS AND MORE\nMay I first remind all members of C&G Union that they\nare members of the ENG SOC, which holds meetings during\nTuesday and Thursday lunch breaks, organises various visits\non Wednesdays and above all has an Annual Dinner in the\nSpring Term.\nThe Society invites a distinguished engineer (usually from\nindustry) to be president for each session. This year's President is Mr. G.B.R. Feildon, CBE, FRS, who is Director\nGeneral of the British Standards Instution. He will be giving\nhis Presidential Address on Tuesday, 19th January, 1971, entitled \"Invention, Innovation and Design.\"\nThe first meeting of the year was a well illustrated talk by\nDr. Grootenhuis of the Mechanical Engineering Department\non the \"Vibration problems in the turbines of the QE2\". We\nheard a very interesting treatise of the development of the\nturbines, their \"testing\", failure and subsequent analysis. It\nproved to be a very good example of the role of the engineer\nin industry today.\nOur second talk was given by Mr. Haslam, of the UK A EA, when we learnt about \"The Steam Generating Heavy Water\nReactor\". Not only were newcomers to the subject of nuclear\ns engineering well catered-for by this excellent lecture but we\nbecame aware of the engineers' socio-economic problems, e.g. whether or not to replace coal-fired power stations with this\nsplendid new equipment, with the coal mining industry set\nagainst the idea.\nWe were very fortunate to hear Prof. Thring of QM C discuss \"Robots\" and show a film of some of his ideas and designs for our third meeting. He too emphasised that it is the\nengineers who must think carefully about the effects of their\nnew ideas on society. He suggested that it was the engineer\nwho cause large numbers of people to have to work in repetitive, de-human ising conditions as a result of the \"industrial\nrevolution\", and that it is up to the engineer to end this by\nimproving automated production of goods so as to free people\nfor more leisure.\nThe rest of this year's programme includes: \"The Hovertrain Project\" (Tracked Hovercraft Ltd.) on 8th December,\n1970; \"Developments in Power Engineering (large generating\nsets)\" (CEGB) on 16th February, 1971; \"Helicopters\" (RAF)\non 4th February, 1971; \"Dams and Reservoirs\" (Binnie and\nPartners) in March, AND a scoop to scoop last year's scoop\n\u2014details later!\nOur visits programme is also developing apace: Rolls\nRoyce, London Fire Brigade HQ, Concorde at Filton (next\nterm), Decca Navigator, Road Research Laboratory (Sum-mer term), a colliery and possibly a brewery.\nThe big event of the year is the Annual Dinner which will\nbe held on Wednesday, 10th February, 1971, in the Union\nDining Hall. The success of the evening depends on the number of students who come along to this affair. We hope to\nhave quite a few OCs and members of staff as well as guests\nfrom other College's EngSocs.\nRemember that the Engineering Society aims to provide\nlectures and visits to show students what is being done in engineering in that outside world. Further details of EngSoc\nactivities can be found on the notice board on Level 3 of\nMech. Eng.\n\n"
