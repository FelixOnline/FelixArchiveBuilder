If there\u2019s\none thing that unites us it\u2019s that.\nTake away our clothes and pack\nus in a room and soon enough,\nwe\u2019ll turn into one big mass\nof flesh, individuality stripped\naway along with the fabrics we so fondly wrap\nourselves in. Maybe that\u2019s why nudity has so much\npower still. Power to shock, move, inspire. Nudity\ncauses a reaction, which is why we use nudity to sell\nproducts, ideas and papers *wink*.\nSo, it\u2019s interesting to see how social factors affect\nthe acceptance of nudity, how some naked bodies are\nmore welcome than others. The social perception of\nnudity reveals many things about our social condition.\nLet\u2019s take the humble nipple, a tiny flap of skin which\nhas been causing so much controversy. Despite the fact\nthat nipples don\u2019t look particularly different across the\ntwo sexes, female nipples receive radically different\ntreatment. While male nippels are a casual feature\nof everyday normality, female nipples are censored,\nrefelcting the treatment of women in our seemingly\nprogressive western society,\nThe free the nipple movement has come under a lot of\ncriticism, but the critics fail to understand that despite\nthe name and campaign strategy, the movement is not\nabout nipples; it\u2019s about freedom.\nThe nipple is just a symbol. Freeing the nipple is not\njust about flesh, it\u2019s about changing a mindframe. It\u2019s\nabout freeing women.\nThis week, just like every other week we have\nproduced a centrefold. Some nipples are visible and\nsome are not. Nothing has changed.\nSo, if you find our centrefold offensive in any way,\ntake a hard look at the reasons driving your feelings.\nIf you don\u2019t, and find the #freethenipple campaign \u2018so\n2014\u2019, well \u2013 good.

Ahead of the\nlaunch of the second season\nthis Sunday, felix lets you\nknow if it retains the quality of\nthe first.\nA\nfter Humans\nfirst premiered\nin the summer\nof 2015, few\nknew what\nexactly to\nexpect. The show clearly had\nsignificant acting clout behind\nit, and its subtle marketing\ncampaign was quick to\npique the interest of the\nviewing public. Sure enough,\nthe series managed to live\nup to, and even surpass,\nits hype: an increasingly\nuncommon feat these days.\nIt rapidly became one of the\npowerhouses of Channel\n4\u2019s prime-time arsenal, and\na second season was soon\nin the works. felix had the\nopportunity to watch the first\nepisode of season 2, ahead\nof its airing this Sunday. You\nmight be wondering how\nwe managed that. Well, it\u2019s\na long and fascinating tale\ninvolving laughter, adventure,\nand signing lots of NDAs.\nAnyways, how does it hold\nup? Well, from what I\u2019ve\nseen, season 2 raises the\nstakes without compromising\nthe quality. \t\t\nEpisode 1 picks up the loose\nplot threads from the first\nseason, as both the Synths\nand the Hawkins family\nattempt to construct some\nsemblance of normal lives\nfollowing their ordeal. The\nSynths stop running and begin\nto discover the complexities\nof both the outside world and\nthemselves. On this front, the\nwriting is subtle and layered.\nExperiences and exchanges\nare constructed to evoke\nmemories and a realisation\nof what the Synths are\nentering; adolescence. The\npoignancy of these moments\ncomes precisely from the\nfact that tropes are leaned\ninto gently, and the point\nis not shoved in your face.\nThe performances on this\nfront, as you might expect,\nare by-and-large beyond\nreproach. The Hawkins\nfamily plot-line, for its part,\nbrings from season one the\nundercurrents of human\nresentment for increasing\nworkforce mechanisation into\nthe limelight. To the show\u2019s\ncredit, it uses quite a variety\nof plot points, some quite\ninsidious, to address these\nconcerns. However, it does\nstray a bit into clich\u00e9 when\ndealing with this storyline.\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a\nbad thing though, and\ngiven the overall strength\nof the writing, I\u2019m willing to\ngive the writers the benefit\nof the doubt. In addition,\ncertain events towards the\nepisode\u2019s close ensure that\nLaura Hawkins will have a\nmajor part to play in events\ngoing forward. It seems\nas if Katherine Parkinson,\nwho by the way is fantastic\nin person, will have ample\nopportunity to flex her acting\nmuscles. Lucy Carless, Pixie\nDavies, and Theo Stevenson\ndon\u2019t, unfortunately, get\nmuch to do this episode but\nturn in typically high-calibre\nperformances, regardless.\nPixies Davies in particular,\nconsidering her age, is one of\nthe strongest child actors I\u2019ve\nseen, right alongside Mad\nMen\u2019s Kiernan Shipka or the\nstars of Outnumbered.\nConsidering that Humans was\na joint production between\nAMC and Channel 4, season\none was relatively UK-centric.\nIts excellent performance last\nyear has clearly bolstered the\n\\\\ It\u2019s a long and fascinating tale involving laughter, adven-ture, and signing lots\nof NDAs \\\\\nBest part of a screening is free beer \\\\ A Deshpande\nApparently being a Synth lets you\nstare directly at the camera \\\\ Channel 4/AMC\nfinanciers\u2019 faith, as the series\nplays out on a much more\nglobal scale this time. The\never-versatile Carrie-Anne\nMoss takes on the recurring\nrole of Dr. Athena Morrow, a\nleading AI researcher. While\nher plot-line was certainly\nengaging, and shows much\npromise, it was a bit lower on\nthe philosophical metaphors\nthan the others. None of that\nis to knock Moss herself, who\nconducts herself with enough\nduplicity and flexibility to\nensure that Morrow will be\nsomeone to keep an eye on\nthis season.\t\t\t\nThe sublime and heavy\non synths (no pun intended)\n80s retro-futurist soundtrack\nmakes a triumphant return.\nThere\u2019s also the great\ncinematography and\ndirection to mention. The\nimagery in this episode is\nrich and makes extensive use\nof visual metaphors. One\nparticular such metaphor\nnear the beginning, involving\na mine-shaft, is particularly\nworth praising.\t\t\nThe first episode of this\nseason throws up a number\nof balls into the air for the\nseries to juggle alongside\nthose still left from season\none. It is fast-paced,\ninteresting, and manages to\nsuccessfully set-up and tease\neven bigger things to come.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Humans,\nor just considering checking\nit out now, you will not be\ndisappointed.\nThe Kardashians\nhave a multi-million\ndollar empire,\na successful TV\nshow, and several\ninfluential brands.\nSo why are they so\nresented?\nAnurag Deshpande\nThe Kardashian kingdom\nT\nhe Kardashians\u2019\nlong standing\naffair with the\nmedia began in\n1994, when Robert\nKardashian Sr. thrust\nthe family into the limelight\ndefending his friend O. J.\nSimpson. In the following\ndecades, members of the clan\nhave appeared sporadically\nthroughout various\nmedia. Kim Kardashian,\nin particular, was always\nquick to maximise her media\npresence, garnering mild\nbuzz by positioning herself\nas Paris Hilton\u2019s supposed\nconfidante and stylist. Kim\nand the family, however, both\nmanaged to fly relatively\nunder the radar of the\ngeneral public until 2007.\nThis was when a sex-tape,\nfeaturing Kim and her then-boyfriend Ray-J, leaked,\nthrusting the family into the\nlimelight. Incredibly, and to\nKris Jenner and Kim\u2019s great\ncredit, they capitalised on this\nnew found infamy with the\nproduction of a reality show\nbased on their lives. Fast\nforward to today, Keeping\nUp with the Kardashians is a\nstaple of the TV zeitgeist and\nthe archetype that springs to\nmind when someone mentions\nthe term \u2018reality show\u2019.\nKim\u2019s net-worth alone has\n\\\\ Keeping up with\nthe Kardashians\nis a staple of the\nTV zeitgeist, and\nthe archetype that\nsprings to mind\nwhen someone\nmentions the term\n\u2018reality show\u2019 \\\\\nexploded from an estimated\n$4.4 million in 2007, to $150\nmillion today. That\u2019s more\nthan Kanye, Drake, and Miley\nCyrus. There\u2019s a reason Kim\ntakes the lead in \u2018Kimye\u2019.\nSo given how successful\nthe family has been, why is\nthere so much ill-will directed\ntowards them, and why do\nsentiments still pervade that\nthey don\u2019t deserve it, or\n\u2018aren\u2019t intelligent enough\u2019\nto have earned it?\nSome people may suggest\nthat they\u2019re vapid or shallow\nbut is this really such a big\nissue? Sure, they can be\nnarcissistic at times, but that\u2019s\nsomething we\u2019re all guilty\nof. They are reflections of\nourselves, our obsessions with\nsocial media and trivialities.\nSurely we can\u2019t hate them for\nbeing extrapolations of us.\nEven then, their perceived\nshallowness never manifests\nitself aggressively, or with\ngreat ignorance. The family\nand series has even made\nefforts to highlight the\nArmenian genocide.\nInstead, perhaps, an\nalternative criticism that can\nbe proposed is that they\ndon\u2019t really \u2018do\u2019 anything.\nThey simply exist as a family,\nand they get paid for it.\nOf course, this is probably\nthe easiest one to debunk.\nYou don\u2019t make that much\nmoney without being a\nshrewd businessperson.\nLooking around, it quickly\nbecomes apparent just\nhow many different pies\nthe Kardashians have their\nfingers in. There are two\ndifferent apps dedicated to\njust Kim, God knows how\nmany perfume and fashion\nlines, and even a colouring\nbook. All that probably takes\na lot of work. \t\t\nOne could rightly take issue\nwith their confused stance on\nbody image positivity. While\nthey certainly promote a\nwide range of body shapes,\nit could be argued this is\nsomewhat inauthentic, given\ntheir reliance on cosmetic\nsurgeries. Although the\nshow does occasionally and\nsuperficially touch on issues\non insecurities, it is usually\nin a very cursory manor.\nThe show is also, largely\nspeaking, empty and\npossessing of little intellectual\nvalue, but it still provides\nentertainment. It\u2019s something\nto have on in the background,\nor if you want to just be\nentertained without thinking\ntoo much. The often dry and\ndeadpan delivery of the\n\u2018actors\u2019 coupled with the often\nridiculous situations they find\nthemselves in makes for great\ncomedy. In addition, anytime\nKanye appears on the show\nis a treat, since his complete\nunwillingness to cooperate\nwith the tone of the show,\nand his frequent incredulity at\nKim\u2019s excesses make for good\nTV.\nAt the end of the day, the\nshow isn\u2019t particularly revolutionary or insightful, but\nit doesn\u2019t really need to be.\nIt does its job, as is clearly\nevidenced by its continuing\nratings success. There\u2019s much\nto be said for the shrewdness\nand capability of the titular\ncast, and certainly a few\nvalid criticisms to be made.\nAll things considered though,\nmaybe it\u2019s time to set aside\nsome of the Kardashian\nhate. They don\u2019t need our\nvalidation, which is why they\ndeserve our respect. Renaissance chic \\\\ E!\nChevrons are the new stripes \\\\ NBCUniversal\n\n"

But then Queen of\nKatwe isn\u2019t your average\nDisney material. It tells the\nstory of Phiona (Madina\nNalwanga) and her family:\nher mother Nakku Harriet\n(Lupita Nyong\u2019o), Night\n(Taryn Kyaze) and her toddler brothers. Their lives,\nlike the lives of everyone\naround them, are a dead-end struggle; sell maize at\na higher price than what it\nwas bought for or the rent\ncannot be paid and their\nfamily cannot eat. There\nis from time to time some\noversimplification of life\nin Katwe \u2013 a wound goes\nuntreated to no conse-quence, for example \u2013 but\nthis is a very impressive\nmovie in that it is not willing\nto sacrifice a sense of place\nand reality for a more\nuplifting story. In fact, it is\nthis commitment to the portrayal of the slum residents\u2019\nhardship that ultimately\nelevates the film above\nits moments of potentially\nclich\u00e9 Disney underdog\ndrama (perhaps it could\neven be called a sports\ndrama, though the game of\nchess may lie outside the\ntraditional boundaries of\nas she starts defeating each\nand every one of them at\nchess.\nIt\u2019s odd here that\nmessages such as \u201cthe\nlittle person can become\nthe big person\u201d don\u2019t feel\nanywhere near as eye-roll\ninducing or hackneyed\nas they might seem on\npaper.

When she\nfollows them in she meets\nRobert Katende (David\nOyelowo), participant in a\nlocal missionary program,\nfootball coach, and chess\ncoach, the latter being\nthe task Phiona finds him\nperforming in this hall. He\nencourages her in, and\nanother young girl Gloria\n(Nikita Waligwa) teaches\nher the basics. She is captivated when Gloria explains\nthe concept of \u2018queening\u2019 to\nher (when a pawn reaches\nan opponent\u2019s side of the\nboard and can be swapped\nout for a more valuable\npiece), because as Gloria\nexplains, it means that \u201cthe\nlittle person can become\nthe big person\u201d From then\non she continues to return\nto the hall to practise chess\nwith all her friends, and\nthough the other children\ninitially tease her for her\nsmell as she can\u2019t afford to\nwash herself, they get their\ncomeuppance one by one\n\\\\ Messages such\nas \u201cthe little person\ncan become the big\nperson\u201d don\u2019t feel\nanywhere near as\neye-roll inducing as\nthey might seem on\npaper \\\\\nNot quite fit for royalty, but pretty darn\nclose \\\\ Walt Disney Pictures\nQueen of\nKatwe\nclear through his confident,\nenchanting directing and\nstunning cinematography\nwhich uses an abundance of\nbeautiful lingering fixed shots.\nThe minimalistic camerawork\nis compounded by a quiet\npiano soundtrack, played\nat various points throughout\nthe film. One can argue that\nno soundtrack would have fit\nthe premise of the film better,\nbut to its credit, the sprawling\nbeauty of a film does end\nin silence. It allowed a short\nperiod of reflection. A film\nwith such subject matter is\nalways at risk of being called\npretentious, and at the risk of\nsounding so myself, the film\ndoes leave you with a sense\nof calm and a reassurance\nin something deep down you\nbelieved is true: life is becoming very busy and you need\nto take yourself out of it every\nnow and then. That might\nhave just been me, though,\nas once the credits finished, a\nwoman behind me whispered\nto her partner \u2018well that was\nunsubstantial twaddle\u2019.\nL\noosely based on a\nbook by George\nProchnik, In Pursuit\nof Silence is a film\nabout how noise has\novertaken our lives and\nwhy we need to treasure and\nvalue silence. The opening\nsequence conveys the level\nof noise saturation in our\ndaily lives well. Various shots\nof nature, still and quiet,\ntransition to a mass of people\nin a public building observing\nsilence for Remembrance\nDay, also still and quiet. At\nthe end of the two minutes,\nthe scene transforms. People\nwalking, talking, phones\nringing, escalators working,\ndoors opening, and traffic\nmoving lead to a sharp\ncontrast to what was just\nobserved. This is our daily\nbackground noise, noise\nwhich we have gotten used\nto, noise we filter out, noise\nwe cope with.\nThe importance of silence\nhas been noticed by people\nfrom all over the world and\nfrom different walks of life,\nranging from Japanese monks\nand tea servers to musicians\nand environmental scientists.\nThe film uses their observations to convey how silence\nbenefits us both psychologically and physiologically,\nwhereas constant exposure to\nnoise is shown to be detrimental to our health. This noise is\nalso shown to be metaphorical in the sense of constant\nmovement and doing. In an\nage of constant connection to\neveryone and everything, the\nvalue of solitude and isolation\nhas been lost and the importance of this is highlighted.\nAs Pico Iyer said in the film, it\nhas gotten to such an extent\nthat we live \u201cin a world of\nmovement, where stillness is\na luxury.\u201d However, the film\nputs across a strong argument\non why this is a luxury that is\nnecessary, and one everyone\nshould invest in. It is after all\na luxury that is free, you just\nhave to want it and set aside\ntime for it.\nPatrick Shen\u2019s belief in\nwhat\u2019s being conveyed is\nMeryl Anil\nIn Pursuit of\nSilence\nWe are surrounded by overpowering noises\nand we need a break \\\\ Transcendental Media\nDOCUMENTARY OF THE WEEK\nBroadcasting\nyour degree\nAt Imperial College London, a \u2018science, technology and medicine\u2019 university, conveying scientific\ninformation to the public and other academics\nis an important part of the research conducted,\nboth for receiving more funding for further research and to showcase major discoveries and\nbreakthroughs made.

The\ndocumentary was filmed\nover two weeks and follows\nan international energy\nconference in Nepal as well\nas interviews with officials\nand locals to highlight the\nissues and needs of a country\nthat has so much potential for\nclean energy generation. It\nwon a prestigious TVE Global\nSustainability film award in\nthe Community investment\ncategory.\nWinds of Change\n(2015)\nThis documentary created\nby two Imperial Physics\nresearchers, Alex Bak and\nTomos Thomas, explores the\nissues of climate change and\nuse of renewable energy\nsources in Peru.

Perhaps\nthis is again down to the\nsense of the realistic hardship of the characters\u2019 lives\nportrayed throughout the\nfilm.\nIt could also be due\nto the script\u2019s greatest\nstrength: its construction of\na complete and nuanced\nnetwork of characters.\nThough Nalwanga\u2019s performance as Phiona is maybe\nnot the most gripping I\u2019ve\nseen this year, we get a\nfull picture of her as a\ndetermined, quietly strong\nyoung woman, with the\ninsecurities that keep her\nrelatable, understandable\nand human. Her relationship with her often-absent\nsister is fantastically done,\nbut the dynamic between\nher and her chess-playing\nfriends is even better. The\nconversations they have,\nthe jokes they make, and\nthe struggles they pull each\nother through never feel\nforced, but as natural as a\ngroup of friends in the real\nworld.\nBest of all are the performances of Nyong\u2019o and\nOyelowo. Robert Katende\nis a truly kind man, one\nthat may have seemed too\nunrealistically perfect if\nnot for David Oyelowo\u2019s\ntreatment of him \u2013 he is\nnot some inconceivable\nliving angel, but simply\na teacher who is good at\nhis job, dedicated with\nall his heart to improving\nthe lives of others. There\nis a scene (grounded in a\nmoral lesson, naturally) in\nwhich he tells the children\nthe story of a dog chasing\na cat that plays out in\na single unbroken take,\nand throughout the scene\nI could not stop thinking\n\u201cgood god, he is a fantastic\nactor\u201d. Lupita Nyong\u2019o on\nthe other hand sheds herself of identity altogether\nand truly becomes Phiona\u2019s\nharsh, overbearing mother.\nMuch the same can be said\nof her performance that\nwas said by Roger Ebert of\nAl Pacino\u2019s performance\nin Scent Of A Woman:\nit is excellent yet \u201crisky,\nbecause at first the character is so abrasive we can\nhardly stand\u201d her. (Like\nmost things about movies,\nRoger Ebert said it better\nthan I ever could.)\nA sense of sterile\nproduction above all else\nkeeps this good film from\nbeing a great one. It is\nafter all a Disney film, and\nI\u2019ve always found that\nthere is something about\nthe best Disney classics\nthat never quite translates into the live-action\nworld. We empathise with\nthe characters, but never\ngrieve for their troubles.\nBut director Mira Nair has\ncrafted an impressive twist\non the underdog sports\ndrama that is powerful in its\nrealism.\n\\\\ Walk Disney Picutres\n\n"

The\ndelight of seeing\nmovement and music\nperfectly aligned?\nOr even the\ndazzling costumes\nthat the dancers\nwear? \\\\\nof the superstars competing\nin the championships such as\nRiccardo Cocchi and Yulia\nZagoruychenko, or Victor\nFung and Anastasia Muravyova. Naturally, the judges of\nthese amazing dancers would\nhave to be even more illustrious \u2013 one of my personal\nidols, Donnie Burns (who held\nW\nhat is it\nabout\nballroom\ndancing\nthat so\nenthrals\nus? The public\u2019s fascination\nwith ballroom dancing began\nyears ago in Hollywood,\nwith Fred Astaire and Ginger\nRogers lighting up the silver\nscreen. And as the wild\nsuccess of TV programs like\nStrictly Come Dancing and\nDancing With The Stars\nshows, its glamour and\nwear?\nWhatever it is, the craze for\nballroom dancing has spread\nover the globe. I myself am\nno stranger to its charms,\nhaving started dancing\nat Imperial on a whim in\nfirst year. One thing led to\nanother, and before I knew\nit I had five pairs of dance\nshoes and was spending most\nevenings a week practicing in\nthe JCR! Incidentally, one of\nImperial\u2019s best-kept secrets is\nthe second life the JCR takes\non after dark. The tables are\npushed aside, the floor swept\nclean of the day\u2019s dust, and\ndancing couples trace figures\nacross the room till security\ncomes to chase them away.\nFor those unfamiliar with\ndancesport, there are two\nbroad styles of ballroom\ndance: Standard and Latin,\nwith five dances in each style.\nStandard (slow waltz, tango,\nquickstep, foxtrot and Viennese waltz) is characterised\nby elegant sweeping steps\ndanced in closed hold across\nthe dance floor, whereas Latin\n(cha-cha, jive, samba, rumba,\npaso doble) is known more\nfor its sensuality and energy.\nAs the two styles are quite\ndifferent, each style is judged\nseparately in competitions,\nand couples \u2013 especially at\nthe professional level \u2013 often\nchoose to specialise in one\nstyle or the other.\nOne of the most important\nevents in competitive danc-esport was held at the Royal\nAlbert Hall a fortnight ago.\nOnce a year for the last 64\nyears, the best ballroom\ndancers from around the\nworld gather to vie for the\nhonour of being crowned\nWorld Champion. I had\nsecured my tickets before\nsummer, and was immensely\nexcited to be attending the\nInternational Championships\nlive for the first time! Anyone\nfamiliar with competitive\ndancesport would have heard\nthe World Professional Latin\ntitle for 14 years), was on the\njudging panel, as were many\nother renowned dancers\nwho had moved to judging\nand teaching after their competitive heyday. I was quite\nstar-struck to be in such close\nproximity to these legends,\nseeing them live and even\nbreathing the same air.\nYes, one would almost have\nenvied the RAH floor, such\nwas the number of incredible\ndancers that graced it that\nevening. But for me there was\none couple that really mat-tered. Marika Doshoris and\nGunnar Gunnarsson, representing the United Kingdom in\nthe Latin Professional Championships! Amazingly enough,\nMarika is the Latin coach at\nIC Dance Club; it is quite an\nhonour to have been taught\nby her since I was a beginner\nin first year. The Marika we\nsee at regular dance practice\nis an incredible dancer, but to\nsee her dancing competitively\nwas truly something else.\nSmall wonder, then, that IC\nDance team members were\nout in full force to support her\nat the Internationals. It was\nrather amusing to hear our\nenthusiastic roars of \u201cMarika!\nGunnar!\u201d resound through\nthe Royal Albert Hall despite\nthe stares from the more\nsedate and proper audience\nmembers.\nIn addition to the\nprofessional category, the\nInternational Championships also include a second\ncategory for amateurs. This\nrefers to dancers who do not\ndance full-time and teach\nprofessionally for a living.\nWhile professional ballroom\ndancers, the sort one sees on\nStrictly, often begin dancing\nat the ridiculously early ages\nof five or six, the amateur\ncategory encompasses those\nwho might pick up ballroom\ndancing later on in life or\nwho cannot do it as a full-time\nInternational dance championships\n\\\\ Maurizio\nVescovo, one of the\nmost well-known\nLatin dancers from\nacross the pond,\nannounced his\nofficial retirement\nfrom competitive\ndancing in an\nemotional letter \\\\\nseemed as unreachable as\ndistant stars, the competitors\nin these amateur rounds\nreminded me of what I as\na student dancer might still\nhope to achieve.\nThe World Championships\ntraditionally concludes with\nthe jive of the final Latin\nround, it being the fastest,\nmost upbeat and energetic\ndance. But the mood after the\nfinal jive took a sombre turn\nthis year. Maurizio Vescovo,\none of the most well-known\nLatin dancers from across the\npond, announced his official\nretirement from competitive\ndancing in an emotional letter\naddressed to the dancesport\ncommunity. Having seen him\nfirst in videos and then live\nduring Internationals, I felt\nthe floor would not be the\nsame without his presence.\nHe was a unique character,\nwith a playful, interactive\nstyle that contrasted with the\nclassic Latin dancers around\nhim. Though opinion on him\nbeauty has captured our\nimagination ever since. Is\nit the beauty of the figures\ndanced in tandem? The\ndelight of seeing movement\nand music perfectly aligned?\nOr even the dazzling\ncostumes that the dancers\ncommitment. This would\ninclude students who started\nballroom dancing at univer-sity, like myself and many\nother members of IC Dance.\nIn fact, two couples from the\nIC Dance Team went to the\nearly rounds of the amateur\nInternationals! Unlike the\nprofessional dancers who\n\\\\ Once a year for\nthe last 64 years,\nthe best ballroom\ndancers from\naround the world\ngather to vie for\nthe honour of being\ncrowned World\nChampion \\\\\n\\\\ The amateur\ncategory\nencompasses those\nwho might pick up\nballroom dancing\nlater on in life or\nwho cannot do\nit as a full-time\ncommitment \\\\\nmay be divided, there is no\nquestion that he managed to\ndefine a strong personal style\nthat stood out on the dance\nfloor. And this is something\nthat I feel is important, especially in ballroom dancing.\nWith all the strict rules in this\nform of dance (Feet turned\nout! Lift that hip higher!) it\nis all too easy to forget that\ndance remains intrinsically a\nform of expression. I like to\nthink of ballroom dancing as\none would think of a sonnet.\nDespite the fixed structure, it\nis within these confines \u2013 or\neven using these confines \u2013\nthat one finds the freedom to\nbe oneself.\nAnd the results of the\nChampionships? Marika\nand Gunnar were ranked\nin the top ten in the world\n\u2013 no mean feat! Riccardo\nand Yulia won the World\nProfessional Latin Championships for the 3rd\ntime, while\nVictor and Anastasia were\ncrowned World Professional\nBallroom Champions for the\nfirst time. Yet these results fall\nflat on paper. How can one\ndescribe the flashes of Yulia\u2019s\nexquisite footwork, or the\nway Victor and Anastasia\nswept gracefully across the\nfloor? Watching them, I was\nreminded once again of the\nmagic behind why I, along\nwith so many other people,\nlove ballroom dancing.\nFor those wanting to give ballroom dancing a whirl,\nIC Dance can be contacted at dance@imperial.\nac.uk or through the Imperial College Dance Club FB\npage.\n// Rob Ronda\n// Paul Hudson\nPst.\nPssssssssst.

The\nsteps along the\nway have been\nsmall but have\nadded towards\nthe big picture\nSaad Ahmed\n\\\\ In general female\ncharacters are\ndefinitely portrayed\nmuch better today\ncompared to\nprevious times \\\\\nin general as they cannot\nrelate to how the females are\nportrayed.\nFocusing on the more\npositive aspects though,\nmore female characters have\nstarted to show up in more\nproactive roles as time went\non. Lara Croft might have\nbeen sexualised but she was\nthe main character of her\nstory in her own right. The\nSuper Smash Brothers series\nwent from only having one\nplayable female character to\nO\nnce upon\na time, Pac\nMan was as\nadvanced as\ngames got,\nwith basic\ngraphics and simple controls.\nWe\u2019ve definitely come a long\nway since then with regards\nto designs, gameplay and\nmuch more. With the change\nand progression of games,\nwe\u2019ve also seen a change in\nhow female characters have\nbeen represented, and for the\nbetter.\nLet\u2019s face it, games never\ndid treat females the same\nway they treated men,\nespecially in the past. Video\ngame development used to\nbe a predominately male\nrescues the damsel in distress,\nplayed out multiple times.\nLook no further than Super\nMario just to get what I\u2019m\ntalking about.\nWe then look a little further\nin time to when graphics were\ngetting better and people\nwere growing up. Around the\n90\u2019s, gaming became a more\nmature business, with a lot of\nyoung gamers now entering\nteens and early adulthood.\nBut as you might expect, the\nfemale characters that were\nintroduced were heavily\nsexualised with bodies way\nout of proportion. The first\ncouple of Tomb Raider games\nfor instance, sure they had\na main female protagonist,\nbut one with large breasts\nand always wearing tight,\nrevealing clothes. The number\nof female characters and\nprotagonists was also a bit\nlacking; some of them had\ngood qualities about them\nbut there was more much\nemphasis on their bodies than\nanything else.\nThings weren\u2019t great with\nregards to representation\nof women. Their very few\ndepictions and appearances\nwere heavily stereotypical.\nThey had hyper-sexualised\nbodies and little to no character development. They were\ndepicted as being helpless or\nvictimized, needing a strong\nmale character to rescue\nthem, and sometimes, fall\nfor. Representation like this\nis harmful. It perpetuates a\nmisogynistic picture to males\nand females, where males\nsee women as objects and\nwomen, either think they\u2019re\nonly supposed to look pretty,\nor stay away from games\na significant number; Princess\nPeach can now beat up\nBowser for all the times he\u2019s\nkidnapped her!\nMoving on to more recent\ntimes, trends have been\nchanging. While game\ndevelopment may still be\nmale-dominated, it\u2019s less so\nthan before and gaming itself\nisn\u2019t. Currently, there\u2019s roughly\nan equal number of females\nwho play games as there are\nmales. With the advent of\nthe internet, it\u2019s also become\neasier to raise your voices at\nanything unfair and absurdly\nridiculous.\nIn general female characters are definitely portrayed\nmuch better today, as compared to previous times. Lara\nCroft now has more practical\nclothing as well as body\nthat is actually realistic. The\nleading female characters in\nthe new Call of Duty games\nare also all strong charac-ters, equally as dominant\nas their male counter parts\nwith proper padded and\narmoured soldier uniforms.\nEven sporting games are\nshowing this trend, with the\nupcoming Don Bradman\nCricket 17 games confirmed\nto have both female players\nand teams, ensuring that the\nwomen\u2019s game is just as fair\nand true as the men\u2019s game.\nThere are also a fair number\nof customisable options where\npeople can choose female\ncharacters and attributes for\ntheir avatars.\nAre things fine then? Is\neverything good? Come on,\nThe evolution of female characters in games\nlet\u2019s be real here, there\u2019s still\na long way to go. In spite of\nthe increase in the number of\nfemale protagonists in games,\nthey are still in the minority\nand not rpughly split 50/50.\nIn some games, sexualisation\nis still present, where the\nfemale \u2018armour\u2019 barely covers\nhalf of a woman\u2019s body. Also,\ndon\u2019t forget the #GamerGate\nscandal in 2014 which started\nas an attack on a female\ndeveloper and escalated into\na shitstorm.\nIt\u2019s nice that Games are\nadjusting for the better. Things\naren\u2019t perfect yet, but they\u2019re\ngetting there, and that\u2019s what\ncounts.\n\\\\ Things aren\u2019t\nperfect yet, but\nthey\u2019re getting better\n\\\\\nprofession, with games catering to the male audience.\nLooking at the very first few\ngames, we had the stereotypical story where the male hero\nFemale characters act as role models and inspiration for other girls; like cosplayers for instance \\\\ Leonardo Veras\n\n"

Turning\nnegative dreams into positive\nexperiences is not a new idea\nin the field of psychology,\npreviously shown to be fairly\neffective in treating PTSD\nsufferers.\nImagery rehearsal therapy\n(IR) is one technique already\nbeing used to help turn bad\ndreams caused by traumatic exposure into positive\nexperiences. It is still unclear\nhow the therapy works or\nhow lucid dreaming may\nbe involved. Although a\ncomplicated concept, lucid\ndreaming is described by\nthe authors of this particular paper as the \u201creflective\nawareness and metacognitive\nmonitoring of an ongoing\ndream\u201d. In other words, it is\nthe ability to become aware\nhad some level of passive\ndream awareness during their\ndreams. The results showed\nthat during IR therapy the\nlucid dreamers who could\ncontrol the content of their\ndreams had significantly\nreduced nightmare distress\ncompared to other groups.\nThis may indicate that \u2018dream\ncontent control\u2019 is underlying\nthis and that there is some\nconnection between lucid\ndreaming ability and the\neffectiveness of this therapy.\nDespite this, the study was\nquite small (only 33 people)\nand lucid dreaming is difficult\nto measure. Although only\none small study, it brings up\ninteresting questions about\nthe power of the human mind\nand the elusive line between\ndream and reality.\nAmy Thomas\n\\\\ Lucid dreamers\nhad significantly\nreduced nightmare\ndistress compared to\nothers \\\\\nwhile you are dreaming and\nto use this to navigate the\ndream world as you please.\nHow subjects achieve this\nand how evidence for success\ncan be harnessed are more\ncomplex questions.\nIf this kind of control is\npossible, it would make sense\nto use it to re-program disturbing dreams and thereby the\nunderlying emotional state\nof individuals, especially in\nPTSD or other psychological conditions that cause\nnightmares. In this study, the\nauthors aimed to investigate\nhow lucid dreaming may be\ninvolved in IR therapy by comparing \u201cnightmare distress\u201d\nin groups with differing lucid\ndream constructs. One group\nhad actual control over their\ndream content, others just\nIs lucid dreaming a cure for nightmares?\nT\n-cell acute\nlymphoblastic\nleukaemia (T-ALL)\nis a fast progressive\ntype of blood\ncancer that affects\nwhite blood cells, especially\nthose activating antibody-producing cells. It affects both\nchildren and adults and since\nit is in the blood, cancerous\ncells can also move to and\naffect other organs of the\nbody.\nDespite chemotherapy\nbeing the most common\ncancer treatment, it is not\nfully effective, with relapse\ncommon in leukemia patients\nspecifically. Dr Christina Lo\nCelso, a researcher at Imperial College London in the\nDepartment of Life Sciences\nexplains: \u201cRelapse is caused\nby cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapy and we\nhad thought that there would\nbe a special place in the\nbody where these cells would\nreside.\u201d Her group is trying\nto understand the interactions\nof leukemia cells with their\nsurrounding micro-environ-ment within bone marrow,\nbuilding on previous studies\nsuggesting they may evade\nthe body\u2019s immune system\nby \u2018hiding\u2019 amongst blood\nstem cells. New research in\nmice, validated with human\nscientists and as Dr Lo Celso\nadds, \u201cNow that we know\nthat the cells don\u2019t hide, we\ncan explore why that is and\nhow their movement helps\nthem to survive. Ultimately\nwe want to find out whether\nwe can stop the movement,\nand whether this could kill the\ntreatment-resistant cells.\u201d\nThe study is still at early\nstages but it may justify why\nprevious attempts to treat leukemia have failed, suggesting\na change of approach in the\nfield.\nFuture research at Imperial\nwill be focused on understanding whether slowing\ndown the chemo-resistant\ncells makes them more likely\nto be destroyed and whether\ncontinuous migration across\ntissues is a hallmark of other\ntypes of leukemia too. This\nwill shed light on the interaction of cancerous cells with\ntheir environment, potentially\nlead to new therapeutic\napproaches.\nNefeli\nSkoufou-Papoutsaki\n\\\\ We want to\nfind out whether\nthis movement can\nbe stopped, and\nwhether this could\nkill resistant cells \\\\\nsamples, has revealed that certain leukaemia cells are more\nmigratory than previously\nthought, they don\u2019t hide in one\nplace.\nThe leukemia cells were\nseen to be actively moving in\nbone marrow, with movement\nspeeding up post-treatment.\nThis came as a surprise to the\nThe race to understand leukaemia cells\n//masha krasnova-shabaeva\nAn Imperial-led team found blood cancer cells actively move rather than hide in bone marrow\n\n"

Hence, virtually no\nmoney was allocated to local\ngovernment, companies, or\norganizations.\nSecondly, the US\ngovernment and organisations\nsuch as USAID spread their\ninvestments in a rather strange\nmanner. Over a $ 100 million\nwas allocated to housing\nprojects, including luxury\ntownhouses with swimming\npools for the staff.\nAs though to further mock\nthe suffering, $ 18 million was\nspent on the construction of\nan Olympic-style sports and\nrecreational centre adjacent\nto one of the largest tent cities,\nwhere clean running water\nand plumbing was alien to\nmost. Even more,$ 260 million\nfunded the completion of\nCaracol Industrial Park, which\nis located over 150 miles\nnorth of where the earthquake\nstruck.\nI\nf you were to hear mention\nof Haiti in a conversation,\nwhat would your initial\nthoughts be? Some of you\nwould likely confuse it with\nTahiti or have no clue as\nto what Haiti actually is. For\nmost of you, though, I am sure\nthe first thing to pop into your\nmindswouldbethedevastating\n7.0 magnitude earthquake\nthat hit the impoverished\ncountry in January 2010,\nkilling an estimated 300,000\nand leaving over two million\nwithout homes.\nmost of the livestock and,\nin some areas, 90% of the\ninfrastructure was destroyed.\nYou may be surprised to learn\nthat this is simply due to the\nfact that almost all the houses\nare essentially tin-roof shacks.\nDespite global awareness\nof the earthquake and its\naftermath, I was shocked to\ndiscover that most remain\ncompletely oblivious to the\npopulation\u2019s current living\nconditions. They assume the\nvast influx of emergency aid,\nwhich I would like to note was\nso highly advertised in the\nmedia, would have repaired\nsome, if not all, the damages.\nNonetheless, over 80% of the\nrubble is unmoved and millions\ncontinue living as refugees in\ntent-cities outside the capital,\nPort-au-Prince.\nIn fact, take a short drive\nthrough and you would be\nastonished at the seemingly\npost-apocalyptic landscape\nthe city became, and still\nremains, since that fateful\nafternoon on the 12th\nof\nJanuary 2010.\nThis begs the question: Why\nare Haitians still living in such\ndire conditions? Conditions\nthat should have been dealt\nwith years ago? One answer,\nhowever paradoxical, may\nlie with the humanitarian aid\ncommunity.\nIn Haiti\u2019s case, external aid\noriginating from NGOs to\nentire governments resulted\nin a plethora of unintended\nconsequences. Few may be\naware of it, but is an issue\nwhich arose long before 2010.\nIn the early 1980s, Haiti\nwas self-sufficient in rice\nproduction. Though, due\nto a growing population,\nthe International Monetary\nFund (IMF) proposed new\ntrade liberalisation policies\non rice imports, aimed at\naffecting mainly peanut, and\nsugar cane cultivation. Thus,\ndespite the well-intended\nnature of this gesture to the\ncountry, the long-lasting result\nwas further destabilisation of\nan already fragile economy.\nAfter the earthquake struck,\nmillions of individuals donated\nto various charities providing\nimmediate emergency aid. A\nwhopping $10 billion were\nraised from these efforts\nand promised to the Haitian\ngovernment. Yet, less than 1%\nreached its designated target.\npreventing famine. Once\nimplemented, import tariffs\nwere subsidised from 35% to\na mere 3%. A wave of rice\nimports from the United States\nfollowed, commonly known\nas \u2018Miami Rice\u2019. Competition\nwith domestic production\nincreased and by the late\n1990s, imports outpaced\nlocal production, and those\nemployed in the sector were\nforced to abandon work and\nmove elsewhere. This created\na dependency on imported\nrice, and this pattern rippled\nacross the agricultural sector,\nAs for me, Haiti is simply\nhome. I am often approached\nabout my origins, and I can\nsay from personal experience\nthat only after my mentioning\nthe natural disaster are people\nable to place it on a map.\nOn the 4th\nof October, Haiti\nwas once again ravaged by\nmother nature, only this time,\nthe culprit was the category\nfour hurricane Matthew. The\nsouthwest region received the\nbrunt of the blow. Crop fields\nwere swept away along with\nNot only has the distribution\nof foreign aid to Haiti after the\nearthquake been conducted\nin a most bizarre fashion,\nwhatever efforts actually did\nreach the Haitian people\npurely involved giving. This\ndid provide immediate and\neffective results in the short\nterm. Nonetheless, after six\nyears of aid influx, it does not\ncome as a surprise that the\ninhabitants\u2019 living conditions\nremain unchanged as they\ngrew dependent on foreign\ndonations.\nTo summarise, aid has\nbecome a self sustaining\nindustry,promotingpermanent\ncharities, particularly in places\nlike Haiti, driving out local\nbusinesses and preventing\ngovernments from progressing\non their own terms. But\nhow can a government be\nexpected to progress when\nexternal influences (e.g.\ncharities) reduce the pressures\nof certain issues (e.g. poverty),\nthereby distracting from a truly\neffective solution? Though\nthere is no correct answer, a\nstepping stone would involve\nefforts aimed at increasing\npressures on local government\nto instil self-sustained change,\nthrough local job creation,\nreconstruction of infrastructure\nand, finally, on education.\nThe Donald was\nnot created in a\nvacuum \\\\ It is, essentially, the\nRepublicans\u2019 own fault\nthat they are stuck with\nThe Donald \\\\\nShaul Rosten explains why Donald\nTrump\u2019s candidacy isn\u2019t much of a\nsurprise after all\nD\nonald Trump\nis, as a bullyish\ntoddler of a\nman, a hugely\na m u s i n g\ni n d i v i d u a l .\nExcept, perhaps, to those in\nthe US whose lives may be\na little more impacted by his\npolitical parties?\nLots of people, over lots\nof conversations, have their\nown answer for this. Bruce\nSpringsteen, for example,\nthis week said that he thinks\nit\u2019s to do with The Donald\npretending to \u2018left-behind\npeople\u2019 that he is listening\nto them when others aren\u2019t. I\nthink that is a short term and\ninaccurate view. In order to\nunderstand the phenomenon\nthat is Donald Trump, in my\nopinion, we have to look\nmore deeply at the root of\nthe problem: The Republican\nParty itself.\nThe Republican Party\ntraditionally stands on\nthe Conservative Right of\nAmerican politics, espousing\npolicies such as free markets,\nderegulation and traditional\nChristian values, against the\nDemocrats, who believe in\nliberalist policies of mixed\neconomies, civil liberties, and\nsocial justice. These divisions,\nand the arguments on both\nsides, are important ones,\nand it is the political wrestling\nof nations between a range\nof approaches that results in\ncountries taking steps forward,\nusing a diverse collection of\nideas and methods.\nThis election, however, is\nnot about these issues. This\nelection is the inevitable\noutcome of years of what I\nwould term \u2018Republican LowRoad-ism\u2019. That is to say, the\nRepublicans abandoning\nreason for madness, slinging\nmud desperately at the\nDemocrats, and appealing to\nthe insecurities and unfounded\nbeliefs of the American people\nin a shameless attempt at\nscooping as many votes as\npossible. This policy, and\nthe post-truth America it has\ncreated, has paved the way\nfor a Donald-like character to\nmarch into the Oval Office.\nThe Republicans have gone\nwith this for so long because,\nthanks to underlying beliefs\nand heavy propaganda,\nAmericans have been coaxed\ninto rejecting rationalist\nobservation, and give their\nvotes to people who defend\ntheir right to stupidity. But even\nthe Washington Republicans\nhave their limits: they are\nbound,atleasttosomedegree,\nby political correctness, and to\nplay to American weaknesses\nsuch as racism and fanatic\nxenophobic patriotism is a\nstep too far.\nBut not for Trump. He is\nhappy to stick his silly face on\nthe news and announce that\nMexicans and Muslims should\nall leave the US, that the US\nshould \u201cscrew\u201d foreign people\nlike he screws them, that\nBlacks have ruined Baltimore,\nand that women are just things\nfor him and other men to play\nwith. This, clearly, resonates\nwith some Americans, and\nhas rocketed his non-existent\npolitical career to where it is\nnow.\n\\\\ This election\nis the inevitable\noutcome of years of\nwhat I would term\n\u2018Republican LowRoad-ism\u2019 \\\\\nThe Republican Low-Roadism has seen some strange\npolicies adopted, such as the\npublicdenialofclimatechange\nand global warming, and the\nfrank and angry rejection of\nevolutionary theory in favour\nof creationism. With due\nrespect to all beliefs, it seems\nodd that a modern, Western\ncountry, that houses such\ngreat intellectual institutions\nas Harvard, MIT and Yale,\nshould have politicians\nclaiming that climate change is\na \u201choax\u201d, and, on the theory\nof evolution, stating \u201cI don\u2019t\naccept it\u201d.\n\\\\ We have to look\nmore deeply at the\nroot of the problem:\nthe Republican Party\nitself \\\\\ncaricature lunacy.\nHe is, at heart, a TV\npersonality, guffawing and\ngrimacing his way onto\nthe news until he becomes\nan ever-present part of the\npolitical atmosphere. But if we\nstop and think for a moment,\nit is startling to conceive that\na man who is openly racist,\nis caught bragging about\nabusing women, and wants\nto throw his running rival in\njail is in contention for the US\npresidency. The fact that he\nsurvived the release of the\ngenital-grabbing comments\nis testament to the fact that\nnobody expects any better of\nhim.\nYes, he\u2019s not the first\nAmerican Right Wing loony,\nand he probably won\u2019t be the\nlast, but how can it be that such\nan individual actually holds\nthe presidential candidacy\nfor one of America\u2019s largest\nIt must be said that there\nare most certainly other\nreasons why Trump has done\nso well: Clinton, although\nvastly more experienced, is\neasy to dislike, and her smug\ndismissal of Trump and his\n\u2018deplorables\u2019 won her few\nfriends. Nonetheless, the\npre-disposition of millions of\nAmericans, particularly white\nmen, to support Trump is\nindicative of the Republicans\u2019\nhaving deepened the furrows\nof systemic racism, violent\nxenophobia and denial of\nbasic science that have cut\nthrough America\u2019s potentially\nbright future. Whilst Hillary\nhas her drawbacks, she is the\nobvious candidate of choice\nfor all rational human beings\nand, as such, I hope it is not\ntoo presumptuous to proclaim:\nwe\u2019re with her.\nAll he\u2019s done is continue\nthe Republican Low-Road\napproach, but take it\nfurther than his rivals were\nwilling to. It is, essentially,\nthe Republicans\u2019 own fault\nthat they are stuck with The\nDonald. The fundamental\npoint is this: Trump is not a\none-off nutcase, but is the\nbed that the Republicans have\nbeen making for the past few\ndecades \u2013 and now they have\nto lie in it.\n\\\\ All he\u2019s done\nis continue the\nRepublican LowRoad approach,\nbut take it further\nthan his rivals were\nwilling to \\\\\n\n"

Women now more\nthan ever are tired of the\nidea that first and foremost\nthey must be likeable. They\nare tired of the concept that\nhaving opinions, being clever\nor funny, or having the audacity to stand up for your beliefs\nmust first make the concession\nto whether we appear to be\nagreeable. In television, particularly in comedy, women\nwho don\u2019t conform are\ndismissed as \u2018shrill\u2019 or worse,\nand clips on YouTube are\nflooded with comments along\nthe lines of \u2018who knew a chick\ncould be funny?\u2019 (When will\nthis myth die?!)\nThankfully, there are a few\nshows (noticeably often those\nwhich are female-led and\ndirected) that buck the trend,\nportraying women neither in\nthe \u2018likeable\u2019 role, nor in a\n\u2018strong independent woman\u2019\nrole. The latter is a trope\nthat substitutes a propensity\nfor violence as a substitute\nfor building a nuanced\npersonality.\nBroad City began as a\ncomedy webseries produced,\nwritten by, and starring Abbi\nJacobson and Ilana Glazer.\nStill available on Youtube,\nthe webseries followed the\ncharacters, Abbi and Ilana,\nthrough life in New York. One\nepisode featured Ilana entering into a relationship with a\nman solely because he had a\nwasher/dryer in his apartment\n(they have previously been\naccustomed to taking clothes\nin bulk to their parent\u2019s home\nin Pennsylvania), another was\nin set in yoga class: \u2018I already\nfeel so much taller, leaner,\nand more organic\u2019 mused\nAbbi as she settled into an\nupwards facing dog pose.\nChampioned by Amy Poehler,\nthe show transitioned into a\nhalf hour show on Comedy\nCentral in 2014.\nThe TV series, with its\nhigher production values,\nhas nevertheless retained\nits rough-around-the-edges,\nimprov feel. The episodes\nmeander through loosely\nsketched plots, falling down\nseveral rabbit holes along\nthe way. In one episode,\nAbbi has dental surgery;\nhigh on painkillers and weed,\nshe wreaks havoc in Whole\nFoods, egged on by the hallucination of a giant stuffed\ntoy named Bingo Bronson. In\nanother, Ilana and her mother\ngo to Chinatown in search of\nknock-off designer handbags and are led through a\nmanhole into an underground\nbunker; in the same episode,\nIlana bursts into joyful twerk-ing at her grandmother\u2019s\nShiva when she hears Abbi\nhas pegged her boyfriend.\nBroad City female leads\nwould be the first to reclaim\nthe title of \u2018nasty women\u2019;\nthough they might prefer\nthe urban dictionary defi-nition: sexually liberated,\nand incredibly cool. Abbi\nand Ilana live pay-check\nto paycheck in rat infested\napartments, have regular\n\u2018weed dudes\u2019, hustle for Lil\nWayne concert tickets, and\nbring pillows into work so\nthey can fall asleep crammed\ninto a bathroom cubicle. They\nhave little or no ambition\nbeyond making the most of\nBed, Bath & Beyond coupons\nthat never expire. They aren\u2019t\nrole models, they\u2019re not\nmeant to be.

The\nBroad City women for all their\nwackiness feel real, dialled-up-to-eleven, responsibility\nand ambition free versions of\nthe smart, hilarious women\nwe all know.\nBroad City above all is\nso exuberantly joyful, it\u2019s\naddicting. It has perhaps\nthe best portrayal of female\nfriendship on television right\nnow (Brooklyn Nine Nine\u2019s\nRosa and Amy have lately\nbeen giving the two a run for\ntheir money). In one particularly iconic scene, Abbi and\nIlana, dressed in homage to\nMissy Elliot and Nicki Minaj\nrespectively, burst into a bank\ndancing to Drake\u2019s \u2018Started\nfrom the Bottom\u2019 to cash\nAbbi\u2019s check for \u2018eight fucking\nthousand dollars\u2019.

The premise of\ntwo best friends living in New\nYork is hardly revolutionary stuff, and yet it\u2019s quite\nunlike anything else. It defies\nexplanation. It should be on\neveryone\u2019s to-watch-list; come\nfor the low-key feminism, stay\nfor the incredible fun.\nBest Buds \\\\ Comedy Central\n\n"

Before you skip ahead (if\nyou haven\u2019t already done so)\ntake a moment to read why\nthis centrefold should not be\nviewed differently to nipple-free centrefolds and why this\nis so important. the survival of the human\nrace for aeons? Without the\nfemale nipple we would not\nbe here today \u2013 historically,\nfemales born without nipples\nfailed to nurse their offspring\nand so were unable to pass\non their genes into the next\ngeneration. But we live in a\nsociety within which breasts\nare hypersexualised and\ntheir function is forgotten. We\nuse breasts to sell everything\nfrom phones to diets, whilst\nbreastfeeding in public is\nreproached. Why remind the\nworld of the existence of your\nnipples when you could just\nuse a bottle, eh?\nThis sexualisation of breasts\ndetracts from their beauty,\nas we are taught that breasts\nshould look a certain way or\nthey are bad. However, in\nreality, breasts are not there\nto be perky, they are there\nto feed young and sustain\nlife. Notwithstanding this,\nsexualisation is not always\nharmful \u2013 embracing and\nexperiencing sexuality can\nbe both empowering and\nliberating, but it\u2019s important\nthat women\u2019s bodies aren\u2019t\nsexualised without their\nconsent. We\u2019ve created a\nworld where breasts are\nsexualised to the point that\ntheir simple exposure is seen as\nsexual, as opposed to natural\nand beautiful. Which is really\nwhat breasts, bodies and this\ncentrefold are. Beautiful.\nThe Free the Nipple\ncampaign began four years\nago, when Lina Esco created\nand featured in a film named\nFree the Nipple. Its aim was to\nraise awareness of everyday\nsexism that exists within our\nsociety by highlighting the\nabsurdity of censoring female\nnipples not only within media\nbut generally within society.\nIn subsequent years the\ncampaign has gained both\nsupport and momentum, with\nparticipation from famous\nfigures including Miley Cyrus\nand Cara Delevingne.\nchose nipples over silicone\nteats. It is about every person\nhaving ownership of their own\nbody and celebrating humans\nof all shapes, sizes, genders\nand races. It\u2019s about quashing\nrape culture and the notion\nthat breasts are simply there\nto look good or please others.\nAnditisforthesereasonsIam\nso passionate about freeing\nthe nipple \u2013 it represents true\nequality for women in our\nsociety. If women are able to\nvote, lead nations and go to\nspace, why on earth must they\nhide their nipples? Exposure\nof the male nipple, which is\nthe vestigial twin of the female\nnipple, has not caused the\nworld to burst into flames,\nso why are we so afraid that\nwomen\u2019s nipples might?\nHaving said all that, after\nleaving the shoot I started\nhaving doubts. What is the\nlaw surrounding this issue?\nCan it impact my future or my\nability to do my job? Will it\ncause me ridicule and shame?\nWill people think my boobs\nare bad or ugly or that I don\u2019t\nhave the right body for public\nexposure?\n\\\\ We live in a\nsociety within\nwhich breasts are\nhypersexualised\nand their function is\nforgotten \\\\\nThe campaign, whilst\nfocusing on nipples, is about\nso much more. It is about\nequality and respect for all\npeople irrespective of gender.\nIt is about mothers around the\nworld who are forced to feed\nbabies in toilet cubicles if they\nWhen I was asked if I would\nlike to take part in a Free the\nNipple centrefold, my first\nreaction was \u201cYes, it\u2019ll be\namazing.\u201d I\u2019ve always been\ntaught to be comfortable\nwith nudity, and I\u2019ve never\nunderstood the stigma\nassociated with breasts and\nthe female nipple.\nSadly, my excitement isn\u2019t\nmirrored by society. We are\ntaught that the female nipple\nis dirty, x-rated. That if we\nslip a bit of nip we are being\nprovocative or disrespectful.\nBut what is so provocative\nor disrespectful about\nsomething that has ensured\nme to do so? Western society\ndenounces Sharia Law for\ncensoring women\u2019s bodies\nthen continues to do the same.\nFundamentally, censorship\nof nipples is no different\nto censorship of faces, but\nsomehow society fails to\nrealise this. Moreover, my\nbody is not an item to be\njudged on its appearance.\nIt should not have to look a\ncertain way to be beautiful;\nthe sheer fact that it is a\nvehicle for my being makes\nit both beautiful and worthy\nof respect. For this reason,\nI resolved with myself that I\nwould not backtrack on my\ncommitment to this centrefold.\nIt is because of the stigma\nsurrounding women\u2019s nipples\nthat I decided to bare all in the\nfirst place. Deciding to back\nout simply adds to the idea\nthat women\u2019s bodies must look\na certain way and that breasts\nand nipples are shameful and\nneed to be hidden. Unless of\ncourse they are both perfectly\nplump and perky, and on\nthe pages of Playboy for the\npleasure of men.\n#FREETHENIPPLE\nThe fact that I was so\nvulnerable to such thoughts\ninfuriates me because nipples\nshould not be criminalised,\nthey should not impact my\ncareer and they should not\nbe a cause for shame. Yet\nbecause I am a woman they\nare. If I had a penis I wouldn\u2019t\nthink twice about whipping\nmy top off for a centrefold, so\nwhy should my vagina cause\n\\\\ Exposure of the\nmale nipple has not\ncaused the world\nto burst into flames,\nso why are we so\nafraid that women\u2019s\nnipples might? \\\\\nFree the\nNipple\nand me\nSebastian Gonzato offers the green\nargument for nuclear power\nA report by Zero Carbon\nBritain in 2007 predicted that\nwhile total wind resources\namount to 3,212, TWh/year,\nonly around 14% of this could\nrealistically be tapped. The\nUK\u2019s energy consumption\nwas 2,249 TWh in 2014, so\neven with other renewables\nsources, meeting this\ndemand is impossible without\nconverting vast swathes of the\ncountryside into wind farms.\nI\n\u2019mcurrentlyinSwitzerland,\nwhich is about to have its\ntwelfth referendum this\nyear (and you thought\nBrexit was bad). Having\nrejected a minimum\nliving wage, the Swiss will be\nasked to vote on an initiative\nproposed by the Greens\non whether to speed up the\nclosing of nuclear power\nplants. Unlike with Brexit, the\nSwiss government is unlikely\nto follow through with this\nproposal no matter the result\nof the referendum, and I\u2019m\ntempted to agree with them.\nThis referendum is actually\nasking when Switzerland\nshould shut down its nuclear\npower plants as opposed\nto whether or not it should.\nHowever, it serves to highlight\na trend in Europe towards\nphasing out nuclear power.\nSwitzerlanddecidedtophase\nwith nuclear power and also\nby legitimate concerns on how\nto dispose of nuclear waste. In\nthe case of Germany, Belgium\nand Switzerland, the choice\nto eliminate nuclear was also\ndue to pressure from green\nparties.\nThis is all well and good\nif it leads to more use in\nrenewables, and in the case of\nGermany at least, it has. (Best\nnot mention Belgium\u2019s track\nrecord.)\nGermany\u2019s Energiewende,\nor energy transition policy,\nhas led to a tripling in the\nelectricity provided by\nrenewables in the last ten\nyears to 31% of the total. Most\nof this comes from wind and\nsolar photovoltaics (PV) rather\nthan dubious renewables such\nas biomass, whose green\ncredentials are questionable.\nIt is hard to argue that this isn\u2019t\na step in the right direction,\nbut that isn\u2019t the whole story.\nThe problem is that coal\nconsumption in Germany has\nstayed constant thanks to its\ndecision to phase out nuclear.\nIn fact, its emissions actually\nincreased some years and\nhave stayed roughly constant\nsince 2009.\nA similar situation has\noccurred in Sweden, where\na tax on nuclear power\nhas allowed for a laudable\nincrease in investments for\nrenewables. Sweden also aims\nto have 100% carbon free\nelectricity production by 2040,\nwhich is simply not possible\nsolely with renewables. A\npaper that appeared in the\nEuropean Physical Journal\npredicted that CO2 emissions\nwould actually double if\nSweden phased out its nuclear\nreactors, principally because\nthe best way to deal with\nintermittency issues would be\ngas fired power plants.\nIn short, going carbon free\nwith only renewables is not\npossible. This is due principally\nto intermittency issues as\nmentioned earlier, but also\nbecause of the sheer amount\nof energy we consume. At\nlast year\u2019s Imperial Climate\nChange Symposium, Asad\nRehman from Friends of the\nEarth stated that there\u2019s more\nthan enough wind and solar\nenergy to satisfy the UK\u2019s\nelectricity demand, which is\nquite simply not true.\nout nuclear after Fukushima\nwhile Germany, Sweden and\nBelgium have been doing\nso (or at least attempting to)\nsince Chernobyl, and Italy\nbecame nuclear free in 1990.\nIn all these countries, the\ndecision to opt out was driven\nby the fear factor associated\nThen there are the problems\nwith intermittency.\nGermany actually causes\nblackouts in Poland and\nthe Czech Republic due\nto the inconsistency of its\nwind power. This is not an\ninsurmountable problem, but\ngiven that storage solutions\nare costly (and come with\ntheir own significant carbon\nfootprint), it\u2019s likely that the\nsolution will come in the form\nof some form of fossil fuel.\nGiven all this, my own\nopinion is that nuclear is a\nnecessary part of the energy\nNuclear power\nis not part of the\nproblem, it\u2019s part\nof the solution\n\\\\ The problem\nis that coal\nconsumption in\nGermany has stayed\nconstant thanks to\nits decision to phase\nout nuclear \\\\ \\\\ Sweden also\nclaims to have\n100% carbon\nfree electricity\nproduction by 2040,\nwhich is simply not\npossible solely with\nrenewables \\\\\n\\\\ Stubborn anti-nuclear\npolicies and wishful\nthinking can be as\ndamaging to the green\nmovement as climate\nchange denial \\\\\nmix, at least until we are able\nto reduce demand to the point\nthat we can meet it with only\nrenewables. On this point at\nleast I agree with the Green\nParty, whose energy policy\naims to reduce electricity\ndemandbytwothirdsby2050.\nCall that target ambitious or\nna\u00efve, but at least it recognises\nthat reducing demand is more\nachievable than meeting it\nwith renewables.\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not\nparticularly pro nuclear and\nmy opinion of Hinkley Point\nis ambivalent at best from\nreading the Private Eye so\nmuch. I do, however, think it\u2019s\nimportant to be practical, and\nstubborn anti-nuclear policies\nand wishful thinking can be\nas damaging to the green\nmovement as climate change\ndenial. This is a view shared\nsurprisingly by the inventor of\nGaia theory, James Lovelock,\nwho has come out as pro\nfracking and nuclear in the\nlast decade. Unlike Lovelock,\nI am not as pessimistic about\nour future as a species, but we\nneed to be more pragmatic\nand less ideological if that\u2019s to\nremain the case.\n\\\\ Nuclear is a\nnecessary part of\nthe energy mix,\nat least until we\nare able to reduce\ndemand to the\npoint that we can\nmeet it with only\nrenewables \\\\\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n404\n- FILE\nN\nO\nT\nFO\nUN\nD\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n\n"

She perfectly captures the character\nof Katie; she\u2019s calm on the sur-face, but the second it even\nbecomes a possibility that\nshe might be under attack,\nshe is ready to fight back,\nand it\u2019s clear that this warrior\nmentality that she has had to\nadopt to keep her family alive\nis taking a hard toll on her.\nBut Squires and Loach also\nmaster the intimate moments,\nand perhaps the most credit\nis deserved by Johns for\nhis beautifully restrained,\ndown-to-earth portrayal of\nDaniel, bringing a light stroke\nof comedy and tenderness\nin perfect balance to every\nscene. Daniel Blake may be a\nlittle old, but he\u2019s sure as hell\nstill determined to make his\nmark, and succeeds in doing\nso; with this film, it\u2019s clear that\nexactly the same can be said\nof Ken Loach himself.\nA\nlot of jimmies\nwere rustled in\nthe film critic\nworld when I,\nDaniel Blake,\nthe latest\nfeature from director and\noutspoken Labour supporter\nKen Loach, took home the\nPalme D\u2019Or (the Cannes Film\nFestival\u2019s highest honour)\nthis year. I was, then, a little\nworried when going to watch\nit; did the Cannes jury just get\na little overexcited about its\nanti-state, anti-Tory message?\nHaving watched the film\nnow, I feel stupid for ever\nhaving such worries. This\nis late-period Loach at his\nabsolute finest. He is never a\ndirector to make a film about\na subject he doesn\u2019t care\nabout, but you can sense the\nrelevancy and urgency in I,\nDaniel Blake more than in any\nother film he\u2019s produced for\nyears. A far cry from his last\nfeature, the rose-tinted rural\nNorthern Ireland tale Jimmy\u2019s\nHall, it tells the story of an old\nman (Daniel Blake himself,\nplayed by Dave Johns) with a\nfailing heart being shafted by\nthe state and being told he is\nfit for work, against medical\nadvice. When he meets Katie\n(Hayley Squires), a single\nmother of two from London\nwith her own story of betrayal\nby the man upstairs (being\nmade homeless because of a\ncomplaint about a leak that\nwas making her daughter ill,\nand finally being allocated\na flat all the way up in Newcastle where the film is set),\nthe pair help each other try\nto make ends meet with what\nlittle time they might have left.\nLoach reinstates himself\nwith this film as the master of\ncapturing the escalation of a\nsmall scene into a catastro-phe; the scene in which a\ncharacter has a breakdown in\na food bank is Loach\u2019s equivalent of an immense cinematic\nset-piece. However, his kitch-en-sink style of realism and\nuse of naturalistic speech by\nscreenwriter Paul Laverty elevate scenes like this until what\nwe are watching becomes not\nTom Stephens\nI, Daniel\nBlake\nA heart-rending cry for justice \\\\ Wild Bunch\nDoctor\nStrange\nJenny Shelley\ncharacter feels only partial-ly-formed at best.\nThe Asian adventure is okay,\nas long as you accept that \u2018Asia\u2019\nis one place with one mishmash\nculture. Despite travelling to\nKathmandu for training, the\nnearest capital for the sorcerers\nis listed as Shanghai and the\nstyle of training feels like that of\nShaolin monks \u2013 meanwhile the\nthree lead gurus have English,\nNigerian and Chinese heritage.\nFrom this confusion, however,\ndoes come a wonderful score by\nMichael Giacchino. The sitar melodies weaving through the film\nare elegant and enjoyable, even\nif it feels a little odd in a potentially kung-fu-esque film. There\nwas also a great risk of making\nthe recovery of Strange from\ncrippled car accident survivor\nto sorcerer a bit insensitive, but\nthe struggle of rehabilitation was\nportrayed relatively well, albeit\nsomewhat montage-ish.\nOverall, the film was an entertaining two hours. There are few\nstudios who could provide a\nsarcastic sidekick in the form of a\ncloak, constant explosions and a\nghost fight (yes, really) in a film\nthat is worth watching \u2013 Marvel\nhas managed it.\nW\nhen\nCumberbatch\nwas\nannounced\nas the newest\nMarvel\nsuperhero, everyone had their\ndoubts. His usual often rather\nsociopathic characters didn\u2019t quite\nseem like they would fit with the\never-growing Marvel universe.\nHowever, with a turned up collar\nreminiscent of Sherlock (he clearly\nknows which looks work for him)\nand a slightly dodgy American\naccent, the newest avenger was\nborn to surprisingly enjoyable\neffect.\nDoctor Steven Strange (Benedict\nCumberbatch) is a neurosurgeon who gets into a nasty car\naccident resulting in his hands\nbeing irreparably mangled. In a\nbid to by-pass the limits of modern\nmedicine, he leaves on-again,\noff-again flame Christine (Rachel\nMcAdams) and turns to \u2018The East\u2019\nfor mystic powers of healing from\n\u2018The Ancient One\u2019 (Tilda Swinton),\nMordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and\nWong (Benedict Wong). While\nStrange is perfecting his magical\nand martial art skill, villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) aims to\nunleash the dark realm upon the\nworld. The character arc consists\nof an arrogant genius suddenly\nbecoming selfless when neces-sary, leading Iron Man, sorry,\nDr Strange, to save the day.\nThe most notable part of this\nfilm, naturally, is the visual\neffects. If you didn\u2019t like the\nfolding buildings from Inception, you will hate this film. It\nbends and twists in fantastic\nways, pausing only for a self-aware reference to LSD \u2013 look\nout for the book in Stan Lee\u2019s\ncameo. But thankfully, the\nstudio didn\u2019t allow this to overtake everything else; the trap\nof using visual effects to compensate for a boring plot-line is\none that they have keenly side-stepped. The jokes are funny,\neven if the many explosions\nare over-loud and overused.\nThe supporting cast are also\nmostly interesting. Once you\nget past \u2018The Ancient One\u2019\nbeing an actual name, Swinton\noffers a noteworthy guru,\nproviding deadpan tongue-in-cheek lines with great effect.\nConflictingly, the love interest is\nhorribly two-dimensional, with\neven less character development than Spiderman\u2019s Mary\nJane or Superman\u2019s Lois Lane.\nAlthough she manages the\noccasional joke, McAdams\u2019\nVisually stunning yet rather baffling - like Cumberbatch himself \\\\ Marvel Studios\nG\nL\nE\nN\nD\nO\nW\nE\nR\nP\nL\n.\nB\nU\nT\nE\nS\nT\nR\nE\nE\nT\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\nHARRINGTON ROAD\nOLDBROMPTONROAD\n5 minutes walk from Imperial at 39 Old Brompton Rd, SW7 3HZ\njust past Starbucks, the Lamborghini showroom and next door\nto the post office\nMEN \u00a324 SHAMPOO, CUT AND STYLE\nWOMEN \u00a330 SHAMPOO CUT AND ROUGH DRY\nWOMEN \u00a340 SHAMPOO CUT AND SALON FINISHED BLOWDRY\nor book online at\nwww.freshhairdressers.co.uk/student-discount\nCall 0207 823 8968 or 07881 991 705\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY, CASH ONLY\nOFFERS A FANTASTIC\nDISCOUNT\nFOR ALL STUDENTS\nOFFERS A FANTASTIC\nDISCOUNT\nFOR ALL STUDENTS\nStock up on chocolate, bob some apples and\ncut eye-holes in the sheets, because a pumpkin\nspice latte won\u2019t save you from those meddling\nkids battering down your door for a candy bar\n- Halloween is upon us. Costume parties will be\neverywhere this weekend, but if you\u2019re anything\nlike me, when you\u2019re at one of these parties\nsurrounded by people dressed as characters\nfrom your favourite movies you\u2019ll wish you had\njust organised a Halloween movie night instead.\nBut what\u2019s stopping you from doing just that? As\na wise man once said, \u201cDon\u2019t let your dreams be\ndreams\u201d If you\u2019re looking for the kind of film that\nwill not just creep you out but deeply unsettle\nyou, here are five (not necesarily horror) films\nthat are perfect for a spooky night in.\nFive alternative\nHalloween\nclassics\nThe closest to traditional horror that you\u2019ll\nfind on this list, Silence of the Lambs is one\nof the handful of films to take home the Big\nFive awards at the Oscars: Best Picture, Best\nDirector, Best Screenplay, Best Actress (Jodie\nFoster), and Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins),\nand deserves each and every one of them. It\nplays out as a psychological thriller in which\nFBI trainee Clarice Starling (Foster) is tasked\nwith tracking down a serial killer who refers to\nhimself as Buffalo Bill. Her first investigative act\nis to question ex-psychiatrist and incarcerated\nserial killer Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) \u2013 a character far more terrifying than any character has\nany right to be. With about twenty minutes of\nscreen-time in a two-hour movie, Hopkins steals\nthe entire show in one of the most compelling\nand unnerving portrayals of a psychopath ever\nput to the screen \u2013 but that\u2019s not to say that the\nrest of the movie isn\u2019t packed wall-to-wall with\nhair-raising sequences delivering psychological\nthrill after psychological thrill, with a terrific\ncentral performance from Foster.\nSilence of the Lambs (1991)\nAlien (1979)\nThe original definitive sci-fi horror, not to mention the film that first introduced the world to\nthe definitive sci-fi heroine in the form of Ellen Ripley, Alien is an essential for geeks and movie\nbuffs everywhere. Awoken from stasis by a mysterious signal from a nearby planetoid, the\ncrew of the spaceship Nostromo stumble upon what appears to be the remains of a mysterious\nalien spacecraft, and a chamber containing a huge number of eggs. Through a series of twists\nand turns the crew end up with a monster on their ship, and not just any monster; the Xenomorph alien is one of the most iconically gut-wrenching sci-fi aliens to have ever been created,\nand is bound to have you screaming in terror during the final spine-chillingly tense sequences.\nCoraline (2009)\nWhat? A children\u2019s film on a Halloween movie list - an animated one, no less?! That\u2019s\nwhat I would have thought if I hadn\u2019t already seen Coraline. Restless 11-year-old Coraline\nJones moves into the Pink Palace Mansions apartment complex with her parents, and soon\ndiscovers a portal to the Other World, the inhabitants of which all mysteriously have buttons\nfor eyes. At first this new world seems awfully cosy, but as time passes and the true nature\nof Coraline\u2019s Other Family is revealed, the film becomes more and more chillingly unsettling.\nHave you ever been afraid of spiders? Thanks to the stunning stop-motion work by the film\u2019s\nanimators, you will be now.\nIt\u2019s a rare occurrence for me that I ever see a film that makes me as consistently uncomfortable and as constantly on-edge as Prisoners makes me. The subject matter itself should\nindicate enough; the worlds of the Dover family (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello) and the\nBirch family (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) are overturned when their children are\nabducted on Thanksgiving, and one of the affected parents decide, against the advice of\nthe investigating detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), to take matters into their own hands, with\nkidnap, interrogation and torture. Who says you need a monster to make a movie scary?\nPrisoners shows that sometimes human beings are terrifying enough.\nWhen Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) and Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) meet, sparks fly\nand their attraction to each other grows more and more with each time they bump into each\nother. Then one night, when Melanie is staying over at a new friend\u2019s house, they\u2019re awakened by a loud thud; a gull has flown straight into the house\u2019s front door and killed itself. The\nnext day, Mitch\u2019s sister\u2019s birthday party is derailed as the guests are attacked by seagulls.\nSparrows plummet down the chimney of Mitch\u2019s home the following evening. These seemingly\nunrelated incidents slowly escalate further and further in this all-time old-school horror classic\nby the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock. Expect a perfectly constructed rising\nsense of dread, a fear of birds that you seriously didn\u2019t need, and one of the most ominous\nendings in film history.\nTom Stephens\nThe Birds (1963)\nPrisoners (2013)\nTell me, do you like fava beans? \\\\ Steven\nLam\n\n"

It took place\nin the Olympic Copperbox\narena and hosted teams\nfrom London\u2019s top handball\nuniversities: University\nCollege London (UCL), King\u2019s\nCollege London, Brunel,\nMiddlesex and of course,\nImperial. Despite its friendly\nnature the tournament\npresented some intensive\ngames.\nThe Eagles started with a\nvery physical game against\nMiddlesex. The team\u2019s\noffensive worked very well\nthroughout, however the\nlack of experience playing\ntogether in defence led\nto a well fought-out draw\n(6-6). The second game\nwas against UCL: despite\nplaying brilliantly in attack\nand fighting well in defence,\nImperial\u2019s team managed\nto get their first win of the\nnight (6-5). Next up were the\nEagles\u2019 fiercest rivals, King\u2019s.\nImproved communication\nbetween players was instrumental in the victory (8-7) that\nnearly secured the title. In the\nlast game of the tournament,\nImperial faced Brunel. A win\nwould secure the trophy, how-ever, losing by no more than\none goal would also suffice.\nAfter an intense game, Brunel\nmanaged to steal a victory\n(3-4), but since the loss for\nImperial was by only one\ngoal, it was enough to secure\nthe trophy for the Eagles.\nThe victory came despite\nan injured team captain,\nJakub Szypicyn. Resembling\nCristiano Ronaldo during\nthe recent European football\nchampionship final, he played\nthe role of a coach and navigated the team throughout\nthe tournament. His actions\non the sideline were key to\nICWomen\u2019sSICK-Operformance\nXinjin Ho\nloss to finish 5th\nout of 14 in\nthe women\u2019s division.

With looming\ndeadlines, housing issues and\nFreshers\u2019 week hangovers\nweighing us down, it was\nhard to get excited for a\nweekend of Ultimate Frisbee.\nHowever, we rose above\nsuch downtrodden attitudes\nand pushed forward with a\npaper thin squad of eight.\nOn day one, we played two\npool games, our first being\nagainst team IRN BREW\n(yes, the Scottish orange\ndrink) which comprised of\na healthy amount of very\nexperienced players. They\ntook the first half from us with\nease, but we came back with\nvengeance and finished just\ntwo points behind. Shortly\nafter, we played the Brighton\nUniversity alumni who go by\nthe name Retired Squaws.\nUsing our young, fresh legs,\nwe scored quickly and took\nthe lead early on in the game.\nDespite a scrappy second\nhalf, our initial lead helped\ncarry us to victory. The third\nand final game we played\nwas a crossover match versus\nthe Skunks, which we calmly\nplayed and eventually won\nto secure our place in the top\neight.\nOn day two, we fiercely\ncontested all our games,\ncoming home with a final\ntally of two wins and one\nStrong wind no problem for IC Windsurfers\nJanice Pun\n\u2018Up the Brum\u2019 in Birmingham\non the 28th\n- 30th\nof October.\nStay in touch with Imperial\nwindsurfing club on Facebook\nif you would like to join us.

The event was hosted\nby the Student Windsurfing\nAssociation (SWA) and is\nthe first of six core events. 18\nImperial windsurfers joined\nin the festivities, breaking\nall past attendance records\nof the club. More than 350\nstudents from 30 universities\nup and down the UK were in\nattendance.\nWith strong winds on\nSunday and mild ones on\nSaturday, both advanced and\nbeginner windsurfers enjoyed\na great time on the lake.\nSusie McAllister, Charlotte\nFlower, Jon Platts, Ryan\nDooze and Athena Wang all\ntook part and impressed the\ninstructors, including our very\nown President, David Salmon.\nDavid was awarded \u2018Best\nInstructor\u2019 of the weekend\nand was gifted a free\ninstructor course and some\ngreat products.\nThe rest of the group\ncomprised a mixture of\nintermediate and advanced\nwindsurfers who took full\nadvantage of the demo kit\nBoardwise brought to the\nevent. The racing was held\non Sunday. Imperial entered\nthree members into the\nteam race: Artur Banach,\nDolores Garcia and Jerome\nde Chillaz.

The Front Row\nUnion were heavily involved\nfrom the start with neat\nhandling along with debutant\nAdam Dowkes, making some\nstrong carries.\nThe IC pressure eventually\nbegan to tell, closing in on\nwhat would have been a\nfirst score, despite a dubious\nknock-on decision. Strong\ncarries from Jerome Hallet,\nJack Dunning and Charles\nPrice-Smith, an audacious\nbetween-the-legs pass from\nHenry \u2018The Horse Master\u2019\nAllingham, and great calls\nfrom James \u2018The Field Ratio\u2019\nField edged IC closer to the\nline, leading to Oli Parker\ncrossing following a grubber\nthrough from Field. However,\nhe was unfortunately pulled\nback for being offside.\nThe pressure was\nmaintained with IC winning\na penalty and the ball being\nsent into the corner. The\nlineout, which has been\ndysfunctional at times this\nseason (this, of course, has\nWe want to hear about your\nmatches, but most importantly,\nwe want to hear about YOU!\nYes that\u2019s right, you, the rugby\nplayers, the badminton play-ers, the dodgeball players and\nthe beyblade players.

Constant pressure\nresulted in infringements and\nmore IC lineouts. The score\nwent to 10-0 when Wright\nscored from another lineout\nafter peeling away from a\nmaul and crashing over from\nfive metres out.\nIC substitutions were made\nwith forgotten man Tom\nMarvin entering the fray.\nSurrey were growing into the\ngame late on just as IC\u2019s structure was falling away.

The pills are, nat-urally, swallowed but the powder can\nbe taken in a number of ways. These\ninclude, but are probably not limited\nto: snorting, smoking, and dabbing (not\nthat kind of dab) it onto your gums. You\ncan also wrap the powder in a cigarette\npaper and then swallow that, essentially\nmaking your own pill. Because of the\ndelayed impact of the high, users often\ntake a second dose presuming the first\nhasn\u2019t worked leading to a double\nwhammy when they both kick in. Mo\u2019\nMD, mo\u2019 problems.\nLegality\nMDMA in any of its forms is straight-up illegal. In the UK it\u2019s a classified drug\n(Class A), meaning you can\u2019t possess it, sell it, or even give it away. Simple\npossession can result in a prison sentence of up to seven years, in addition to an\nunlimited fine, and the police are pretty much obligated to give you some form of\nformal caution regardless of how much you have on your person. This is the norm\nworldwide, with Ecstasy falling under a UN agreement. Funily enough, a slip-up\nin Ireland last year meant that for a day it was legal to possess and buy Ecstasy as\nwell as a whole host of other drugs before emergency legislation was passed.\nThings to do when you\u2019re high\nDo\n\u2022 Keep some chewing gum\nhandy (you grind your teeth\nwhen rolling)\n\u2022 Listen to music\n\u2022 Channel that impulsive twitch\ninto creative and erratic\ndancemoves\n\u2022 Make new friends\n\u2022 Express your feelings\nand partake in bonding\nexperiences (not bondage\nexperiences)\nDon\u2019t\n\u2022 Drink too much water (might\ncause brain swelling)\n\u2022 Do any tasks that require\nsitting still\n\u2022 Tell people you love them\n(because you probably don\u2019t)\n\u2022 Eat like a horse (you\u2019ll likely\nthrow up)\n\u2022 Mix with a downer (a\ndepressant drug) or alcohol.\nAlthough, this is controversial\nadvice.\nGlossary\nBomb \u2013 MDMA wrapped up in paper, packaged up for ingestion\nRolling \u2013 to be high on MDMA\nMunday Blues \u2013 the comedown caused by\nMDMA the day after use. It will make you feel\ndepressed and generally like shit.\nBuzzing \u2013 to be high on MDMA\nafter smoking weed\nCuddle Puddle \u2013 a clump of ecstasy users on\nthe floor sharing feelings\nComing up \u2013 starting to feel the effects of\nMDMA\nBean \u2013 a capsule containing drugs\nDropping \u2013 Consuming MDMA\nCandy Raver \u2013 the sort of people you will\nencounter at a rave, popping pills and\nadorned with colourful beads.\nWhat it does\nFirst thing\u2019s first, 3,4-Methylenediox-ymethamphetamine (which is handily\nabbreviated to MDMA) is the active\ningredient in ecstasy pills. Within half\nan hour the buzz kicks in and can last\nanywhere from three to six hours. This\nenergy buzz is what caused E\u2019s rise\nto prominence in conjunction with the\ndance and rave culture of the 80s and\n90s, allowing all night parties to live up\nto their name. Bucketloads of serotonin\nand dopamine are released, generally\nmaking everything feel better.\nCareful though, as this energy buzz can\nsubside rather quickly, resulting in anxi-ety, paranoia and generally not a great\ntime. Word to the wise :what you take is\nusually nowhere near pure and is likely\n\u2018cut\u2019 with some nasty stuff which could\nhave any number of side effects.\nSome statistics\nAccording to the crime survey of England and Wales, roughly 1 in 20\npeople consumed the drug in the past year, with it being the third most\ntaken drug behind cocaine and cannabis. MDMA-related deaths are\non the up in the UK with 50 people dying last year, linked to a rise in\nstronger, more pure pills and powders.\nDisco Cokies\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug use, visit talktofrank.com\n\n"

Women have\ntraditionally been a marginalized and oppressed social group and\nin our modern society, we still face prejudices unknown to our male\ncounterparts. In the spirit of \u2018Imperial Girls Can\u2019, I\u2019ve listened to the\nfiery Felix Feminist Power Playlist and here are my first impressions\nand what I\u2019ve learnt from these songs.\nFelix Feminist Power Playlist\nChristina Aguilera\nCant\u2019 Hold Us Down\nAbigael Bamgboye\nListen to this when: you\nwant to refute someone\u2019s\n\u2018witty\u2019 remark. As females,\nthere\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019ve\nall experienced some kind\nof sexism. Sometimes, it\nfeels easier to ignore the\nstupidity after a long day.\nHowever, we have to tackle\nthe underlying issue. After\nlistening to this song, you\u2019ll be\nready to obliterate whatever\nnonsensical stupidity comes\nyour way.\nListen to this when: someone\n(or you yourself) tries to\ndevalue your achievements.\nAs an eight year old, I\nremember listening to this and\nthinking nothing of the power\nrhetoric this song relates. But\nnow, ten years later, it has a\nwhole new meaning \u2013 while\nyour achievements in life are\nyour own, the obstacles may\nnot be. However, you have to\nbelieve in yourself before you\ncan overcome whatever lies\nin your way. When you take\nresponsibility, you ultimately\nsee results.\nListen to this when: you\u2019re\nfeeling sassy. This song never\nceases to send chills down my\nspine. At some point in life, it is\ninevitable that we will encounter\nrude, obnoxious or arrogant\nbehavior (it\u2019s everyday on\nLondon transport). Instead of\nfighting fire with fire, put on\nthis song and simply outclass\nthe source of offence. Integrity\nsimply attracts respect.\nListen to this when: life\u2019s\nchallenges make you want to\ngive up.\nNobody starts from the top.\nIn classic early 2000s style, in\nthis song Nicki Minaj iterates\nthe importance of sharing\nthe story of your journey,\nstruggles, tears and sweat. It\u2019s\nso easy to look at the finished\nresults and forget the pain it\ntook to get there. Whatever\nyou want to do, you can do\nit and you will do it. Go forth\nand make it happen.\nListen to this when: you\u2019re sick of watching the news. How do\nyou deal with something hideously absurd? With something\nwonderfully so. Russian feminist punk rock protest group\nhave struck back at Trump with an instant classic. \u201cThe\nowner of vaginas is not some narcissistic stupid orange\nape who\u2019d claim that he could easily grab women by their\npussies. The owner of vagina is a woman. Who wears her\nvag as a badge of honour.\u201d\nDestiny\u2019s Child|\nIndependent Woman,\nPt. I\nAretha Franklin |\nRespect\nNicki Minaj | I\u2019m the Best\nPussy Riot |\nStraight Outta\nVagina\n4\n1 3\n5\nListen to this when: someone\nmakes a idiotic or ignorant\ncomment. Hard Out Here is a\nrather comedic rebuttal to the\nobjectification of women. After\nall, when you can laugh at\nthe labels people give to you,\nyou\u2019re a million times closer to\novercoming them.\nLily Allen |\nHard Out Here 6\n2\n// YayA Lee\n//Peter Sekesan\n//Eva Rinaldi\n//Pussy Riot\n\n"

Harambe\nhas become the subject of\nvarious internet memes since\nhis controversial death,\nincluding the popular \u2018Dicks\nout for Harambe\u2019. Many have\nnoted the surprising longevity\nthe meme, which has been\nattributed to the reluctance\nof corporations to co-opt\nhis image as part of their\nmarketing campaigns.\nSpeaking to felix, Paul\nBalaji described his initial\nexpectations for the event:\n\u201cIt was literally just a bit of\nbanter, maybe I could invite\na couple of hundred friends,\n20 show up and we can chill\nin Hyde Park for a bit and\nthen head to the Union or go\nout somewhere.\u201d Despite the\npopularity of the candlelight\nvigil on Facebook, it\u2019s possible\nthat the event could run into\ntrouble with park authorities;\nRoyal Parks policy requires\nthat any gathering over 40\npeople must contact the park\noffice. However, Paul was\n\\\\ It was literally\njust a bit of banter,\nmaybe I could invite\na couple of hundred\nfriends, 20 show up\nand we can chill in\nHyde Park for a bit\nand then head to\nthe Union \\\\\nmore optimistic: \u201cThe event\nis so big people are actually\nquestioning whether it\u2019s\ngonna happen or not \u2013 it will\nhappen.

(exclamation\nmark and everything)\nlast Monday, at an event\nthat saw seasoned as well as\nnovice entrepreneurs, take\nto the stage and share their\nexperiences in the Union\nConcert Hall.\nNas Andriopoulos, Union\nPresident, started the event\nwith a warm welcome in\nwhich he outlined the aims of\nthe ACT Now! scheme which\ninclude creating \u201cthe hub\nfor all enterprise activity at\nrecent endeavour to create\na company aimed at fast\ntracking medical examinations\nthrough the drone facilitated\ntransportation of samples.\nThe team talked about the\nhurdles they had to overcome\nand the difficulty of trying to\nrun a business during their\ndegrees, but ended on a high\nnote, encouraging aspiring\nentrepreneurs to believe in\ntheir ideas.\nIlana Taub runs a viable\ncompany which consciously\nmanufactures snacks in an\neffort to reduce global food\nwaste. Like Dell and Debesh,\nTaub talked about the\ninspiration behind her business\nas well the challenges she has\nhad had to overcome, some of\nwhich she\u2019s still facing. These\nincluded financial viability\nof the product as well as the\nethical complications that\narise when trying to create a\nsocially conscious business.\nDespite the quality of the\npresentations, the event left a\nbitter aftertaste and some of\nus wondering whether social\nwork and entrepreneurship\nshould ever be marketed as a\npair.\nImperial\u201d. The scheme involves\na series of workshops, pitches,\nand sessions with people\nwithin the Union to help\nfurther social enterprise ideas\nyou might have.\nThe first speaker to be invited\non stage was Paul Barlow\nfrom Creative Conscience,\na company which tries to\nconnect \u201cyoung designers\nwith a problem and [unite]\nthem to change the world\u201d.\nThe Unilever-sponsored not-for-profit holds annual awards\nfor \u201csocially valuable, human\ncentered design\u201d, the winners\nof which get \u201cmentorship or\ninternships (through the CCA\nnetwork) and profile building\nPR activities\u201d. Sadly the prizes\nmade the awards feel more\nlike a way for companies to\npoach talented, driven and\nsocially conscious individuals,\nrather than promote social\nentrepreneurship.\nTalks from a number of recent\nentrepreneurs followed,\nincluding Tristan Dell &\nDebesh Mandal from IRIS\nDrone Technologies, current\nIC undergrads, and Ilana\nTaub from Snact who eagerly\nshared their experience.\nThe former talked about their\nPaul may or may not sleep with this on his bedside \\\\ Cale Tilford\nStudent accommodation situation dire\nStudent Accommodation Awards refuse to choose winner\nAbigail de Bruin\n\\\\ Our student\njudges have sent a\nclear message that\nthe industry needs to\ndo better \\\\\nlisted on the College website\nconsists solely of GradPad.\nThere is a Union Council paper\nthat handily sums up the issue:\n\u201cThe basic PhD stipend is less\nthan a years rent at GradPad\u201d.\nIt also appears Postgraduates\nwill remain unable to use\nCollege as a guarantor until\nthree years of international\nundergraduate students have\nbeen trialled successfully.\nT\nhe skyrocketing\nprice of student\naccommodationhas\nbeen an ongoing\nissue in the minds of\nstudents, one that\ncertainly feels all too familiar\nfor Imperial students living in\nLondon. This week saw the\npublication Property Week\nbeing forced to withdraw a\ncategory from their Student\nAccommodation Awards after\nthe panel of student judges\nrefused to choose a winner\nfor Student Experience in a\nprotest over increasing rent\nprices.\nThe panel consisted of\nstudents from a broad range\nof institutions including UCL,\nBristol and Manchester\nMetropolitan University. In\nan open letter tweeted by\nJenny Killin, welfare officer at\nthe University of Aberdeen\u2019s\nStudent Association, the panel\nexplains the decision they\ntook: \u201cNone of the entrants\ncould demonstrate that\nthey are meeting the urgent\nneed of students to live in\naccommodation that will not\nforce them into poverty\u201d.\nThestudents\u2019openlettergoes\nmuch further into explaining\nquite how dire the current\nsituation is, stating that one\napplicant \u201cputs shareholder\nsatisfaction before student\nsatisfaction and boasts \u201c\u00a320\nmillion revenues\u201d and ends\nresoundingly in the statement\n\u201cUnless all students have\naccess to safe, affordable\naccommodation at every\ninstitution and the means to\npay for it, there is no cause for\ncelebration, nor the ability for\nus to award a for-profit sector\nfor failing so many of our\npeers.\u201d\nThe decision by the student\njudges has been treated\nrespectfully by Property\nWeek, with a spokesperson for\nthe Student Accommodation\nAwards saying in a statement\nto The Guardian: \u201cOur student\njudges have sent a clear\nmessage that the industry\nneeds to do better. In light of\nthis,wehavetakenthedecision\nto remove this category for\nthis, our inaugural event, and\nreview it for 2017. We will\ncontinue to encourage the\nindustry to raise its game and\nput the student experience\nat the centre of everything it\ndoes.\u201d\nIt is a hollow comfort to hear\nhow universal the situation\nis across other institutions.\nThis is an issue that has been\ndiscussed frequently over\nthe last few years at Imperial\nCollege Union, featuring\nheavily in many DP (Welfare)\nmanifestos. Last year saw\nJennie Watson\u2019s proposal\nfor College to act as a rent\nguarantor for overseas\nstudents being accepted and\nagreed by the Provost, a clear\nwin. That said, there is clearly\na lot further for College to go\nwhen it comes to affordable\nstudent accommodation.\nThe primary target for\nfurther action here surely\nhas to be for postgraduate\nstudents, whose current\naccommodation offering as\nIC Girls Can - only do girl things\nCellebrate women\u2019s sport by \u201cjumping away the calories\u201d Lef Apostolakis\nC\nontinuing on from\nthe successful\nThis Girl Can\ncampaign, Sport\nEngland have\njoined forces with\nBUCS to promote female sport\nparticipation at universities\nnationwide between 31\nOctober and 6 November.\nThis means the Union is\nlaunching Imperial Girls Can\nagain this year in an attempt\n\u201cto encourage and celebrate\nwomens sport\u201d.\nThe initiative sees twelve\nevents at various locations\non and off campus (but\npredominantly at Ethos),\nplaces on which can be\nreserved for free by quoting\nIC Girls Can.\nInterestingly, half of the\nevents are dance or aerobics\nclasses, two are lectures\nincluding a lecture on healthy\neating, and one is the ACC\nSports night.

On Tuesday\nmorning, it was announced\nthat Emma Rice will be\nstepping down from her role\nin April 2018, following the\nclose of the 17/18 season.\nNot only this, but with Rice\ngoes \u201cthe current nature of\nwork, which has characterised the period since Emma\nassumed the position\u201d. That is\nto say, all of the modernising\n(new lights and actual sound\nsystem), the shaking up and\nreinventing of the texts, it\u2019s all\ngoing away in April 2018.\nThis decision has been\ndressed up as a decision\npurely about the intended\npurpose of the Globe vis\nIn a time when all-female casts are still seen as a gimmick Jack Steadman discusses the\nimportance of bending and breaking original texts and taking gender off the list of casting\nspecifications\n\\\\ Does that then\nmean that all of\nShakespeare\u2019s roles\ncan be played by\nanyone, of any\ngender? It\u2019s a\nquestion that has an\nobvious answer \u2013\nyes, of course they\ncan \\\\\nthe question. Do Lloyd\u2019s three\nproductions, all part of one\nbig project, really work as\nevidence for women being\nable to play male roles? Just\nbecause it was successful in\nthis case, and an extreme\ncase at that, does that then\nmean that all of Shakespeare\u2019s roles can be played\nby anyone, of any gender?\nS\nhakespeare. \u201cWho\nowns Shakespeare?\n\u201c. This is the idea\nPhyllida Lloyd and\ncompany set out\nto challenge with\nher all-female production of\nJulius Caesar at the Donmar\nWarehouse in 2012.\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss that\nmove as a gimmick, a knock-off copy of the all-male\nShakespeare productions\nthat pop up like clockwork,\nbut with none of the historical\nauthenticity those productions claim to wield. However\nsuch dismissal would be mis-guided, both when it comes\nto intentions and results. Lloyd\naccepted that first directing\njob at the Donmar Warehouse on the basis that she\nwould like to direct something\nwith a cast that would be\nat least half female, before\nrealising that she actually\nwanted to go even further in\naddressing theatre\u2019s gender\nimbalance. And as for results,\nby virtually all accounts, the\nplay was a success, with winning reviews and contented\naudiences across the board.\nOf course, success doesn\u2019t\nactually make all-female\nShakespeare not a gimmick\nper se. But it does make it\nsuccessful, on this occasion\nanyway. Regardless, Lloyd\nand company returned to\nall-female Shakespeare\nin 2014 with a production of Henry IV (also at\nthe Donmar), which was\nannounced to be the second\npart in what would now be\na trilogy of all-female productions directed by Lloyd.\nSimilarly praised, similarly\nsuccessful, and (depressingly)\nstill seemingly against the\nnorm.\nAnd now, two years later,\nwe\u2019re at the final part: Lloyd\u2019s\nall-female The Tempest has\nopened \u2013 not at the Donmar,\nbut at a new, purpose-built,\nin-the-round theatrical space\nat King\u2019s Cross (if you want\nyour gimmick, there it is. Popup, purpose-built theatres). All\nsigns so far point to a similar\nresult of critical praise and\naudience adulation. But does\nthat mean they can be taken\nas proof that women can\nhandle Shakespeare\u2019s biggest\nroles as well as the men?\nMichael Billington, The\nGuardian\u2019s lead critic, in\nhis mostly positive review\nof that 2012 production of\nJulius Caesar, suggests that\nits success doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwe\nshould get carried away and\nstart arguing that single-sex\nShakespeare is the only way\nforward.\u201d He does have a\npoint. All-male Shakespeares\nrun the risk of dissolving\ninto what can only be called\nhistorical intellectual mastur-bation, becoming trapped\nby their slavish loyalty to the\noriginal production. There\nis nothing more boring than\na Shakespeare with nothing\ninteresting to say, and you\ncertainly can\u2019t accuse an\nall-female Shakespeare of\nthat.\nBut \u2018not boring\u2019 alone\ndoesn\u2019t really help answer\nIt\u2019s a question that has an\nobvious answer \u2013 yes, of\ncourse they can \u2013 but it seems\nto have taken the world of\ntheatre an awfully long time\nto get there.\nJulius Caesar was a theatrical revelation when it landed,\nbut it\u2019s hard to escape the\nsense that it still feels like an\nabnormality in the general\ncurrents of male-drive Shakespeare. The words \u201call-female\nShakespeare\u201d do not feel\ninstantly at home, do not\ninspire the general indifference that greets \u201call-male\nShakespeare\u201d. The all-female\nTempest still feels like a big\ndeal. But it\u2019s not like females\ntackling Shakespeare is new.\nTake Hamlet. The Crown\nPrince of Denmark is quite\npossibly the goal in theatre\nfor any young, aspiring\nactor. But that hasn\u2019t stopped\nHamlet being played by\nwomen \u2013 as early as 1777,\nSarah Siddons was playing\nthe prince in Manchester,\nwhile in the same year as\nLloyd\u2019s Henry IV, Maxine\nPeake appeared as Hamlet\nin a production at the Royal\nExchange, in Manchester\nyet again. It can and does\nhappen but it\u2019s not exactly\na daily occurrence. Peake\nwas the first female Hamlet\nin thirty-five years. That\nbeing said, the current crop\nof shows in London theatres\ndoes seem to suggest that\nthings might finally be on\nthe mend. As The Tempest\nplays in the Donmar\u2019s new\nKing\u2019s Cross theatre, over\nthe river in Waterloo the Old\nVic is staging King Lear with\nveteran actress Glenda Jackson in the title role. Billed as\nJackson\u2019s return to the stage\n(after a good few decades\naway serving as an MP), the\nproduction goes up against\na more traditional one by the\nRoyal Shakespeare Company,\nwith Anthony Sher in the\nsame role. Neither production\nreduces the other \u2013 if any-thing, the prospect of seeing\ntwo titans of the field try their\nhand at the role should have\nShakespeare-loving audiences salivating.\nFurther east along the river,\nover at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe,\nthings have ventured even\nfurther from the traditional \u2013\nand, admittedly, away from\nthe subject of women playing\nmen (and instead into the\nrealm of just redefining the\ntexts around the women).\nUnder new artistic director\nEmma Rice, the theatre has\ntaken a bold new approach\nto the texts, unafraid to try\nunconventional approaches\nwhere previously they followed a more softly authentic\napproach (particularly under\nCastingwomeninmalerolesisnotagimmick Mark Rylance). This has thus\nfar culminated in Imogen \u2013\na production of Cymbeline\nthat shifts the focus onto\nKing Cymbeline\u2019s daughter,\nImogen (who actually has\nmore lines than the king in the\noriginal text, since you didn\u2019t\nask), and renames the whole\nthing more appropriately in\nthe process. And if the Globe,\nthe very home of Shakespeare in London and (along\nwith the RSC) the authority on\nShakespearean productions,\ncan pull off something like\nthat, then why can\u2019t everyone\nelse? When will we see the\nlikes of Ophelia? Actually,\nthat\u2019s a bit of a trick question:\nwe already have seen it in the\ncase of Ophelia, in a production by Katie Mitchell at the\nRoyal Court earlier this year,\nbut I digress.\nWe are still in the phase\nwhere seeing women play\nthe likes of Hamlet, Lear,\nProspero and Macbeth does\nstill feel, despite itself, a little\nlike a gimmick. It\u2019s ultimately\nan unfortunate side-effect\nof their rarity, and until such\ngender-blind casting becomes\nthe norm, it\u2019ll probably continue to feel that way. But that\ndoesn\u2019t diminish the power,\nurgency, and thrill of the\nswitch, and it certainly doesn\u2019t\nrender them innately bad or\nwrong. And sure, there will\nbe the odd bum performance,\njust as there is with their\ncountless male equivalents.\nOne of the many joys of\ntheatre, but especially of\nShakespeare, is the way the\noriginal text can be bent,\nbroken, and reforged into\nsomething new with every\nproduction. The story may\nstay the same, but through\nchanges in setting, in casting,\n// Rafael Mart\u00ednez\nin any one of many factors,\nthe play can be found anew.\nCasting women in the \u2018male\u2019\nroles of the play is just one\nway to achieve that \u2013 but it\u2019s\nalso a way that provides the\nadded bonus of seeing some\nof our greatest actors tackle\nsome of our greatest roles.\nSeeing women take on the\nmantles previously expected\nto be worn only by men feels\na vis Shakespeare and his\noriginal productions \u2013 \u201ca\nradical experiment to\nexplore the conditions within\nwhich Shakespeare and his\ncontemporaries worked\u201d, as\nthe board\u2019s statement put it.\nSuch a claim \u2013 coming as it\ndoes with remarks that future\nprogramming \u201cshould be\nstructured around \u2018shared\nlight\u2019 productions without\ndesigned sound and light rigging\u201d \u2013 feels an awful lot like\nwindow-dressing for a sadly\nbackwards attitude from the\nGlobe.\nThis is all despite\nacknowledging that the\n\u201cmould-breaking work\u201d of\nRice had achieved \u201cstrong\nbox office returns\u201d, which\nis no mean feat in a theatre\nlike the Globe, which sells\nabout 90% of the available\ntickets as standard, and the\nnew, diverse audiences being\nattracted there.\nFundamentally, while the\nGlobe\u2019s board may have a\npoint in there somewhere \u2013\nspecifically the one about\nbeing founded to explore\nthe original circumstances\nof Shakespeare \u2013 this can\u2019t\nhelp but feel like a mixture\nof a complete cock-up and\na missed opportunity. The\nboard inescapably knew\nwhat they were getting when\nthey appointed Rice \u2013 you\ndon\u2019t appoint an artistic\ndirector without coming to\nsome kind of agreement on\ntheir vision for a theatre. To\nback down now, like this, is\njust cowardly and pathetic.\nAnd that\u2019s all before you get\ninto the fact that Rice is \u2013 was\n\u2013 one of few female artistic\ndirectors in the country, and\none in charge of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe at that. You\ncouldn\u2019t have made a better\nstatement about how theatre\n\u2013 all theatre \u2013 is for every-one, of all genders, at a time\nwhen it feels like theatre might\nfinally be moving towards\nredressing the balance.\nNow, of course, that\nstatement just starts to feel\nlike maybe theatre is the\nsmall-minded, boys-only club\neveryone thought it might be.\n// marsroverdriver\n\\\\ Within hours of\nthis article being\ncompleted, the\nGlobe\u2019s board went\nand pushed out\ntheir female artistic\ndirector \\\\\n\\\\ We are still in\nthe phase where\nseeing women play\nthe likes of Hamlet,\nLear, Prospero and\nMacbeth does still\nfeel, despite itself, a\nlittle like a gimmick \\\\\nmore important than ever,\nespecially in a year where\nwe might \u2013 finally \u2013 see a\nwoman take on the ultimate\nmale-only mantle: President of\nthe United States. Try and call\nthat a gimmick.\n\\\\ One of the many\njoys of theatre,\nbut especially of\nShakespeare is the\nway the original text\ncan be bent, broken,\nand reforged into\nsomething new with\nevery production \\\\\n// Joel Honeywell\n\n"

The only\nmorning in the week\nwhen it is entirely\nappropriate to put a\nhush to the endless\nlist of unwatched Panopto\nrecordings, lie-in until the\nchurch bells ring, then lazily\nroll out of the house in time\nfor grocery shopping. Aside\nfrom snatching the half-priced flowers from Waitrose\nto adorn my ill-maintained\nwindow sill, another one\nof my weekend leisures I\nhave grown to appreciate is\nbrunch.\nBack in Hong Kong,\nbrunch is an odd trend\nreserved for those hipster\ncaf\u00e9s and high-end hotels,\nnormally populated by\nexpats, upper-middle class\n20-somethings or those who\nprefer soggy, overpriced\nPain Perdu over the Hong\nKong style French toast. (A\ndeep fried, inch-thick slab of\nwhite bread drenched in egg\nmixture, condensed milk and\ngolden syrup, plus a knob of\nbutter and a wallet-friendly\nprice of \u00a32. What were they\nthinking?)\nLuckily in London, I\u2019ve had\nmore than my fair share of\ngood brunches, from British\negg benedicts to American\npancakes, Indian naan rolls\nto Israeli shakshuka. Here,\nbrunch isn\u2019t a trend that will\ndissipate after a few months\nunder the attack of some rain-bow-coloured grilled cheese,\nbut simply a meal for one to\nrelax, catch up with friends\nand getting ready for another\nweek (of 9 am lectures stuck\nin a warm, stuffy lecture hall\nlike sardines) to come.\nTwo Sundays ago I had\nthe lucky opportunity to\nbe invited to Camino, a\nmini-chain of Spanish tapas\nrestaurants, to review their\nbottomless brunch menu.\nKnowing that tapas are never\nreserved for lonely diners,\nI requested a plus one and\ndragged my friend in the\nwind and rain to Bankside,\nwhere they have a branch\nlocated conveniently in the\nshadows of Tate Modern.\nThe exterior was exactly\nwhat you\u2019d want for the\nwindow and studied the menu\nwhile savouring their juicy,\nhome-marinated manzanilla\nolives. We chose 3 tapas\neach, and were presented\nwith our own bottle of cava to\nshare plus a carafe of orange\njuice for mimosas.\nThe tapas arrived quickly\nand filled the surface of the\ntable, transforming it into a\nproper feast. The view, or\n#tablesituation in Instagram\nlanguage, was spectacular.\n6 tapas dishes in total with\na generous addition on the\nhouse of a beautiful char-cuteria platter with slices of\nIberico Cebo and Serrano\nham. Our gossiping was\nreplaced by a speechless\nawe; we couldn\u2019t wait to\ndig into the arrangement of\ncolours, textures and smells\ndisplayed before us.\nThe Crispy Baby Squid\nwas served as tender, lightly\nbattered bites with the cutest\npot of aioli on the side. My\nfriend couldn\u2019t get enough\nChristy Lam\n\\\\ In Hong Kong,\nbrunch is an odd\ntrend reserved for\nthose hipster cafes\nand high-end hotels,\nnormally populated\nby expats \\\\\n\\\\ Churros were\nfried to order, dusted with icing sugar,\nserved with a pot of\nrich, velvety, dark\nchocolate sauce \\\\\n\\\\ Potatoes are cut\ninto precise cuboids,\nwith crispy edges\nsoaking in a slightly\nspicy brava sauce\nand mellow aioli \\\\\nperfect chilled hang out under\nthe wet rays of October\nsunlight: a few shrubs here\nand there, comfortable sofas\nand red blankets laid out\nthoughtfully to fight against\nthe chilly breeze. Upon\nentrance, we were greeted by\nan unexpected serenity for a\nSunday afternoon, which was\nthen broken by the cheery\nmanager, waiters and relaxed\nmusic.\nAfter a quick introduction,\nwe chose our table next to the\nof this even when we were\nabsolutely stuffed towards the\nend. The Arroz Negro, their\nsignature dish, was a creamy,\ncomforting risotto in an enticing jet black sauce \u2013 made\nwith squid ink, which gives\nfavourite. My friend crowned\nthe juicy, flavourful Iberico\nMeatballs while I took the rest\nof the Tortilla de Patatas, with\nits slightly sweet, runny eggs\nsandwiched between layers\nof potatoes. Two hours in\nand we were still eating; the\nexcited munching turned into\nnibbles between sips of cava\nand gossip, dictated by our\nsatisfied stomachs.\nWait. Did I say we were\nstuffed?

As such, Council\nrequires they produce reports\non what they\u2019ve been up to.\nAfter apologising and\nreassuring council of his\ncommitment to prevent this\nfrom happening again in the\nfuture, he presented verbally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable that I was\nunable to present a written\nreport at the Council meeting\nthis week,\u201d he later told\nfelix. \u201cRest assured this is a\none-off occurrence and I will\nguarantee that a full written\nreport will be presented at the\nnext meeting in two weeks\u2019\ntime.\u201d\nThe absence of a written\nreport didn\u2019t go unnoticed\namongst the other members\neither, with one anonymous\nCouncil member saying \u201cthe\nwhole concept of a council\nreport is that you are elected\nas a student and throughout\nyour time as an elected\nofficial you are accountable\nto them. Part of that is telling\nthem what you\u2019re doing. If\nyou\u2019re not writing a report\nyou have closed all channels\nof communication and you\nmight as well be a member of\nstaff. That\u2019s the whole point\nof having elected sabbatical\ncomplications with the room\nbooking, and there was no\nconfirmation of whether\nthere\u2019d be a Union staff\nmember to take minutes until\nthe very last minute.\nIn fact this is actually the\nsecond scheduled Council\nmeeting of the year, but the\nfirst one to be realised, as\nan earlier meeting had to\nbe cancelled due to lack of\norganisation (in particular\nissues with room booking).\nCouncil Chair, Abigail de\nBruin, had wanted to start\noff the year by providing\ntraining for Council members\nand inherent within that was\nthe assumption of having\nthe Governance Manager\u2019s\nsupport. But the Union role\nwas made redundant earlier\nthis July so Council members\nwere only sent a powerpoint\ninstead. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had\nthe authority to summon 16\npeople to listen to me talk,\nwhereas if there is a staff\nmember there\u2019s an element of\nvalidation to it\u201d, says de Bruin.\nThe removal of the role\nand the perceived failure to\nreallocate most of the duties\nthat came with the position has\nmade many students unhappy.\nThe role of Governance\n\\\\ No one really\ncares what happens\nthere. Just let the\nstudents be angry\nsomewhere \\\\ Manager encompassed things\nsuch as organising minutes\nand agendas for all the major\nmeetings in the Union, being\nthe deputy returning officer\nfor the Big Elections, as well\nas being an integral part of\nthe Governance Committee,\namong other things.\nThis has led some to believe\nthat the removal of the\nGovernance Manager role\nis a symptom of a general\ndisregard for democratic\nprocesses. As de Bruin\nexplains, \u201cThere\u2019s been\na fundamental issue that\nI\u2019ve definitely felt since I\u2019ve\nstarted. Because attendance\nwas repeatedly poor last year,\nUnion Council, despite being\nour greatest democratic tool,\nhas been really disregarded.\nIt\u2019s thought of as this thing like\n\u2018It happens but noone really\ncares what happens there.\nJust let the students be angry\nsomewhere.\u2019\u201d\nShe concludes, \u201cIt\u2019s just\nthe same issue we\u2019ve faced\nin the Union for years:\nCommunication with the\nmembership.\u201d\nJust look at how \u2018packed\u2019 it once was (c.2013) \\\\ Cem Hurrell\nofficers.

Densely\npacked nutrients\nbind to colour pigments,\nhence why colourful veggies\nare thought of as bright\nbundles of nourishment.\nMost white or pale foods\nare overlooked, with many\nlacking fibre and nutrients.\nHowever, a few of these pasty\nprovisions lack the attention\nthey deserve.\nOne in particular starts with\na \u2018C\u2019, and should be your\nnext study buddy due to its\nimpressive brain-boosting\nproperties. I\u2019ll give you the\nrest of the article to try and\nguess it. Most of the foods\nmentioned in this article\nare an anti-cancer army,\ncontaining the body\u2019s master\nantioxidant, glutathione.\nIn particular, they contain\nphytochemicals that inhibit\nmutation-causing enzymes,\nreducing the chance of\ncancer.\nWe kick off with alliums,\nnamely onions, garlic and\nchives. Many people think\nof them as flavour enhancers\nrather than what they really\nare \u2013 gleaming nutritional\nkingdoms. Warding off old-age and disease, these guys\nmake other vegetables look\ndownright lazy. They are\nrich in sulphur, protecting\nus against cardiovascular\ndisease, chronic inflammation\nand microbial infection. Fun\ntip: after chopping garlic,\nwait for 10 minutes before\nadding it to whatever you\u2019re\ncooking. This makes it more\nheat-resistant, and enhancing the flavour and effect of\nnutrients.\nAh, the magic of mush-rooms. With more than\n2,000 varieties out there, the\nmost commonly consumed\ninclude button mushrooms,\ncrimini and portabella. They\ncontain a compound called\nErgothioneine, that humans\ncan\u2019t make but can be found\nin fungi, kidney, red beans\nand liver. It\u2019s been found to\nhave profound anti-inflam-matory and antioxidant\nproperties. A popular use for\nshrooms, and one I strongly\nsupport, is a total substitute\nfor meat. This reduces calories and salt whilst adding\nfibre, nutrition and flavour.\nIf you really need meat, try\nadding chopped mushrooms\nto your mince.\nThe special C-word? If you\nguessed cauliflower, you win\nthe prize of my gratification\nfor reading this whole article.\nNot only does cauliflower\nfight cancer, it enhances cognitive function and memory,\nlowers blood pressure and\nimproves kidney function. Not\nsure what else you could ask\nfor in a vegetable. My last\ntip: to preserve cauliflower\nnutrients content, do not boil\nthem for more than 3 minutes.\nAntioxidants are found in\nthe outer layer, making full\nimmersion in boiling water a\nblow to all its efforts.\nNow go forth, steam your\ncauliflowers, stuff it in your\nsandwich, and head to the\nlibrary. Bask in the little \u2018thank\n-you\u2019s your brain, heart, and\n(abused) liver murmur.\nWhyvegetablesaresavingtheplanet\nT\nI can already feel\nthe eye-rolls. The\n\u201cOh, this vegan\nhippy nonsense\nagain\u201d eye-roll, so\nbefore I lose you\nall, let me promise that I\u2019m\nnot going to preach about\nanimals\u2019 feelings or inform\nyou how tasty avocado is.\nWhat I am going to tell you\nabout is a VegFest-induced\nrealization of how easy it\nis to make a difference to\nthe environment and how\nmany people are doing so\nalready.\nRoughly speaking, VegFest,\nwhich takes place in London\nOlympia every year, is one\nof the biggest congregations of vegans you will see,\nspanning over 250 stalls.\nThe result? 15,000 people\ngetting excited about hemp\nburgers, coconut yogurt and\ntables full of vegan cake.\nWhat made me excited,\nhowever, was not the fact\nthat some vegan scientist has\ninvented milk free Camembert (exciting as that is), but\nthe realization that so many\npeople are making a stance\nin trying to lead a more\nsustainable lifestyle.\nWe\u2019ve all been told from\na young age about waste,\nrecycling and taking public\ntransport but how does\nbeing vegan, veggie or\neating less meat make a dif-ference? Raising animals for\nfood, in fact, produces more\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nthan all cars, planes and\nother transport combined,\nand uses 30% of the Earth\u2019s\nland mass. In the US alone,\n70% of all grown grain\nis fed to farmed animals -grain that could be used for\nmillions of starving people.\nIn terms of deforestation,\nnearly 80% of land deforested in the Amazon is used\nas cattle pasture. Now isn\u2019t\nit a happy thought that just\nby having almond milk with\nyour cereal or switching to\nQuorn once a week you\u2019ve\nled to the production of 13\ntimes less fossil fuel and 15\ntimes less water usage than\nyou would have by having\nan animal-derived product?\nIt\u2019s been a good-news-filled October for the\nenvironment: more than\n150 countries reaching a\ndeal to cut hydrofluorocar-bons, Spain announcing\nwind energy is sufficient\nto meet 70% of it\u2019s energy\nneeds and researchers at\nthe University of Wisconsin\ninventing eco-friendly floor-ing. Seeing the amazing\nturnout at VegFest however,\nproved that the environment is not something only\ngovernments and eccentric\nscientists are worrying\nabout, but thousands of\npeople worldwide too.\nF\nact: pineapples are\nthe only food to try\nto eat you while you\neat them.\nYou read that\nright: pineapples are\nactually flesh eating monsters.\nThe zombie apocolypse is\nupon us.\nPineapples contain an\nenzyme, called Bromelain,\nwhich is released when you\nchow down on your favorite\ntropical treat. It targets and\nbreaks down a range of proteins in your mouth, and can\ncause anything from strange\nsensation to bleeding gums.\nGiven that Bromelain is also\nused to tenderize meat, you\ncould call this the equivalent\nof punching yourself in the\nmouth repeatedly.\nIn fact, if you left a slice of\npineapple on your tongue for\na week it would completely\ndissolve it (disclaimer: do not\ntry this at home). Luckily, most\nof us can chew faster than\nthat, and once you swallow,\nyour stomach acid inactivates\nthe enzyme, rendering this\nfoul beast harmless. Even\nbetter, the body will quite\nhappily replace the damaged\ncells in your mouth, leaving\nno lasting damage. Man 1,\nPineapple nil.\nSo there you have it. Pineapples: Delicious, nutritious and\nsurprisingly aggressive.\nAnother one of Mr Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\npineapples\nfight back\nWhen\nNutrition writer Alexandra Lim encourages\nus to eat more pale vegetables\nSara Hamilton reviews London\u2019s biggest vegan festival, commenting on how\ncutting down on meat may be the answer to our environmental problems\n\n"

It\u2019s clear to me now that\nactive participation does not\nequal consent, and I know\nnow that something was\ndifferent from the moment I\nwoke up.\nI don\u2019t think that any of\nmy friends thought that I\ndeserved to be raped, that by\nbeing too drunk or generally\npromiscuous I was asking\nfor it. They just didn\u2019t believe\nthat I hadn\u2019t given consent.\nThe grey area that surrounds\nexactly when someone can\ngive informed consent is difficult to navigate, and crossing\nthat line can be easier than\nyou\u2019d think. There are so\nmany people who have been\nin a situation where they\nfelt uncomfortable about\nsomething that happened,\ngrey area that they\u2019re damaging and traumatising.\nFor me, it was difficult to\ncome to terms with how much\nit had upset me. How can you\nbe traumatised by something\nthat you can\u2019t remember, or\nsomething that maybe wasn\u2019t\neven unpleasant at the time?\nThere wasn\u2019t anything to have\nflashbacks about, just an\nintense feeling of unease and\nunfocused anxiety.\nIt took a long time, a lot\nof evidence, and an astute\ninterpretation of an offhand\ncomment I made to a sexual\nhealth doctor to make me\nrealise that I did have a\nright and a reason to feel\ndistressed, and to release\nsome of the guilt that I\u2019d been\nfeeling.\nI like to think that now I\u2019m\nokay. I no longer freak out\nwhen I see him on Facebook,\nand I could probably interact\nthrough the college on\nevery level. Every day in my\nacademic career, I am forced\nto fight and defend myself\nas equally competent as my\nmale counterparts. Imperial\nstrives to achieve equality for\nall genders, and for the most\npart, things are improving.\nBut it is horrifying to find\npeople in this environment\nwho feel that it is my fault that\nsomeone chooses to have sex\nwith me without my consent,\nbecause I made the decision\nto drink too much at a party.\nIt is appalling that there are\npeople here that think that\nI no longer have ownership\nof my body if I have slept\nwith more than n people in\nthe past. At Imperial, the\nsexism that I face every day\nmanifests itself in a rape-and-control culture that is subtle\nand pervasive.\nI didn\u2019t expect to be in the\nsituation where my friends\nwere slut-shaming me after\nbeing sexually assaulted. I\nthought that these were lib-eral, good people, who were\ntwo and a half years in prison\nfollowing his conviction in\n2012. For victims of sexual\nassault and rape, it is very\ndifficult to report the crime,\nand this is reflected in the\nnumbers of unreported cases.\nFor the accused, it can be\nincredibly damaging, as this\nis one of the few parts of the\nlaw where guilt is assumed\nover innocence, regardless\nof the outcome of the trial.\nAlthough I feel strongly that\nhaving had his conviction\noverturned, he should now\nbe treated as innocent, I was\nhorrified to read about the\nline of questioning that the\nvictim (who made the accu-sation) was forced to endure.\nShe was subjected to an\nexamination of her sexual his-tory, with her previous sexual\npartners giving evidence as to\nwhether they thought that this\nparticular sexual encounter\nthe words of Donald Trump,\n\u201cgrab her by the pussy\u201d, and\ncontrol her however they\nwant.\nIt\u2019s funny when you know\nthe person who assaulted\nyou so well, when their lives\nare so intertwined with yours;\nextracting yourself from this\ntangle is complicated and\ntraumatic. After enduring\nmonths of having panic\nattacks whenever I could not\navoid returning home, I managed to move out. Filtering\nout my cutlery, books, and\ngames consoles from his room\nwas painful, and the stupor\nthat I was in while packing\ncost me a lot of my stuff, that I\nwas long resigned to losing.\nTo get my coat back feels\nlike it\u2019s come full circle. Along\nwith the coat comes a rush\nof memories and emotions\nsurrounding how I lost it. I\ndon\u2019t think that I\u2019m the same\nwith him face to face without\nhaving to take the next day\noff to lie in a dark room. I\nstruggle to remain friends\nwith people who still see me\nas simply regretting having\nsex with him, who have told\nme to stop making excuses\nfor my decisions, and who\ncontinue to reference it. I\u2019m\nno longer friends with my\nother housemate, who it turns\nout questioned my ability to\nconsent at the time, but didn\u2019t\nthink to intervene.\nThe repeated surveys and\ncampaigns that take place at\nImperial reveal an undercurrent of sexism running\naware of the subtleties of\nconsent. Imperial being Imperial, I think that in general we\nexperience less widespread\nlad culture than the average\nuniversity. But what I learnt\nfrom this is that misogynistic\nlad and rape culture is deeply\ningrained in everyone, even\nhere, and we need to actively\ntry to correct it. Having a\nperipheral awareness of the\nexistence of rape culture, and\nacknowledging that it is a bad\nthing is simply not enough.\nIn a recent retrial, footballer\nChed Evans was found not\nguilty of raping a girl in a similar situation, after spending\nwas something that she would\nhave enjoyed and wanted.\nThis questioning sets a\ndangerous precedent, as it is\nhorrendously discouraging\nto victims of sexual assault to\nknow that they may have to\ntolerate public questioning of\nthis level in order to enforce\nthe law. I know that my previous sexual behaviour does\nnot contribute to whether or\nnot I am giving consent in\nsituations like this, and that\nallowing the consideration\nthat it might merely serve\nto perpetrate the idea that\nif a woman is promiscuous,\nanyone has a right to, in\nbut never acknowledged that\nthey could be faultless.\nConsent classes are being\nheld all over the country to\ntry and tackle the vast gap\nbetween what films and\ntelevision, pornography, and\n\u2018lad culture\u2019 tell us is a normal\nsexual encounter, and what\nactually constitutes informed\nconsent. This isn\u2019t to dampen\nanyone\u2019s fun \u2013 you can have\nsex when you have been\ndrinking \u2013 but we all need\nto reconsider whether what\nwe often think of as casual\ndrunken flings are making us\nand our partners feel good,\nor if they\u2019re so far into the\n\\\\ I don\u2019t think\nthat any of my\nfriends thought\nthat I deserved to\nbe raped, that by\nbeing too drunk\nor generally\npromiscuous I was\nasking for it. They\njust didn\u2019t believe\nthat I hadn\u2019t given\nconsent \\\\\n\\\\ I didn\u2019t expect to\nbe in the situation\nwhere my friends\nwere slut-shaming\nme after being\nsexually assaulted.\nI thought that\nthese were liberal,\ngood people, who\nwere aware of\nthe subtleties of\nconsent \\\\\nperson who lost this coat,\nwho felt safe enough among\nfriends to get that drunk. To\nbe assaulted cost me friends,\npossessions, and eventually\ncontributed to the end of my\nrelationship, and these consequences are not something\nthat I can easily forget. But\nafter I get it very thoroughly\ncleaned, I\u2019ll put the coat back\non, and each day I wear it\nI\u2019ll remember, and every time\nI remember it will get a bit\neasier. After losing so much,\nto get something back feels\nlike I\u2019m finally taking back\ncontrol.\nDrunk consent is not consent. My rape story\nT\nhis week the coat\nI lost on the night I\nwas raped found its\nway back to me.\nHaving lan-guished, dirty and\nunloved, at the back of a\ncupboard in a house I occasionally visited for parties,\nit was unearthed in a start-of-year clean and returned\nto me. I had been there a\nyear and a half ago for a\nclub social, where I\u2019d drank\nway beyond my limits, and\nthe night had gone terribly\nwrong.\nI had amazing friends there\nan Uber and taken home.\nI\u2019m told it was difficult to\nget me in an Uber. At home,\nmy friend and my housemate\npoured me into bed, noting\nmy badly bruised and bleeding knee as I uncoordinatedly\nwriggled into pyjamas. I was\nconfused, begging for my\nboyfriend. One of them made\na joke that he wasn\u2019t there\nbecause he didn\u2019t love me.\nI believed him when he said\nwe\u2019d broken up, and cried.\nThey later told me that I was\ntoo scared to sleep alone,\nand that I insisted that my\nother housemate, who had\nhave consented to it. Extra-relationship sex wasn\u2019t exactly\nsomething that I could claim\nto be unfamiliar with, and\ndespite the unfamiliar gnawing feeling I had, I trusted that\nmy housemate had not taken\nadvantage of me. My casual\napproach to sex was always\nsomething that I\u2019d had control\nof; when I\u2019d had sex it was\nalways on my terms. I\u2019d never\nregretted or felt ashamed of a\nsexual encounter before, and\nit was disconcerting to have\nto ask a third party what I\u2019d\ndone, and simply not know\ncondition in which I would\nhave consciously agreed to\nhave sex with someone, much\nless someone who I would\nhave to live with for another\nsix months, and who I hadn\u2019t\never actively considered\nsleeping with\nBut, before I fully under-stood, while I was still\nprocessing my hazy idea of\nwhat had happened, word\nspread to our mutual social\ncircle. On top of having to\npatch over the deep wound\nthat my apparent choosing to have sex with this\njust arrived home from a different party, get into bed and\nsleep with me so that I didn\u2019t\ndie in my sleep.\nWhen I woke up in the\nmorning, naked, with this\nhousemate in my bed, and\na pool of vomit staining my\nsheets, I had to ask my other\nhousemate what had hap-pened. We\u2019d had sex, he told\nme. He\u2019d heard. Twice.\nI don\u2019t remember what\nhappened. I don\u2019t remember\na lot of the night leading up\nto this, and it took months\nto piece together what had\nhappened. Months where I\nconvinced myself that I must\nhow I\u2019d felt at the time.\nI later found out the extent\nof my memory blackout. I\u2019d\nbeen totally out of control. I\nhad thrown up in at least two\nlocations, as well as being\nvomited on by someone else.\nHe later told me that I was\nawake and actively partici-pating, and I believe him, but\nI like my sexual encounters\nwith a bit of dignity, and\nthat does not stretch to\nbeing covered in blood and\nvomit. Without the memory\nof what happened, I have\nthe more evidence-based\nassertion that this was not a\nwho offered to take care of\nme, but I had drunk so much\nthat I was out of my comfort\nzone, and drunkenly created\na Facebook group chat to\nmy most spoken-to contacts\n(including my mother) begging someone to come and\npick me up. One friend lived\nnearby, and he came and\ncollected me, and took me to\nhis flat.\nOnce I was there, I was\ndisoriented and scared.\nI thought I was at my\nboyfriend\u2019s house, and\ndemanded to know where he\nwas. I demanded to be put in\nparticular person gored in my\nrelationship, I found myself\nexpected to joke about it\nand laugh along. After all, if\nyou\u2019re someone in an open\nrelationship who occasionally\nhas sex with friends, no one\nthinks that any sex you could\nhave with a friend could be\nnon-consensual, no matter\nwhat state you might have\nbeen in. It seems that most\npeople really do believe that\nif you\u2019re someone who \u2018gets\naround\u2019 when you drink,\nyou\u2019re probably always up\nfor it.\nThere\u2019s such a grey area\n\\\\ I\u2019d been there a\nyear and a half ago\nfor a club social,\nwhere I\u2019d drank way\nbeyond my limits,\nand the night had\ngone terribly\nwrong \\\\\n\\\\ When I had\nsex it was always\non my terms. I\u2019d\nnever regretted or\nfelt ashamed of a\nsexual encounter\nbefore, and it was\ndisconcerting to\nhave to ask \\\\\n\n"

I had to go\nto Guangdong, China and\nfind the village from which\nmy ancestors left China\nL\nast Tuesday I watched\na viral video showing\nSocial Justice Warriors\n(SJWs) at the University\nof Cape Town, South\nAfrica, decrying\nscience as racist because it\nwas developed by European\nscientists and isn\u2019t applicable\nto Africa. Also, magic is real\nand science cannot explain\nhow witch doctors can call\ndown lightning bolts from\nthe sky. When one scientist\nin the audience said that it\nwasn\u2019t true, the SJWs berated\nand scolded him until he\napologised. They ended by\nsaying that people should\ndecolonise their minds and\nreject Western modernity.\nI stopped going to lectures\nand made it my life mission to\ndecolonise the world around\nme. #endwesternhegemony.\nI was dressing when I\nrealised that T-shirts and jeans\nare American inventions.\nHow dare the Americans\ncolonise my clothes?

I turned off all the\nelectrical appliances and\nhuddled underneath a blanket,\nannoying my flatmates. When\nthey complained about the\ncold, I bought a sack of coal\nto burn for warmth and they\npromptly threw me out of the\nflat.\nI first went to the Chemistry\ndepartment at Imperial and\nloudly demanded that they\nstop teaching it since the basis\nof Chemistry was discovered\nand advanced by the Arabs.\nAlas, their colonised minds\ncouldn\u2019t take the truth and the\nsecurity guard evicted me.
