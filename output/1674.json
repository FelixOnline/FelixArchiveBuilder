Pay no mind\nto anyone who claims\n\u201cthere is no good music\nanymore\u201d. At Felix we unfortunately don\u2019t have the\ntime to review everything\ngood that comes out,\nso curated here are ten\nfantastic releases from the\nlast month that you can\njudge for yourself.\nArtist: Kelela. Label: Warp.\nFor Fans Of: Arca; FKA\nTwigs; Jessy Lanza. Release\nDate: October 6th\n. 54 minutes\nTAKE ME APART\nIf you travelled back to\nthe 90s and told a Warp fan\nthat their favourite label\nwould be releasing R&B\nthey\u2019d laugh you back\nto the present. Although,\nafter one listen of Take\nMe Apart it\u2019s obvious the\nalbum is a perfect fit for\nthe IDM powerhouse.\nKelela\u2019s voice cuts\nthrough a rumble of drum\nmachines and sub-bass to\ncarry messages about sex,\nlove, and the difficulties\nthey create. Take Me Apart\nis a classic in the making.\nArtist: Kaitlyn Aurelia\nSmith. Label: Western Vinyl.\nFor Fans Of: Suzanne Ciani;\nAnimal Collective; Holly\nHerndon. Release Date:\nOctober 6th\n. 51 minutes\nTHE KID\nDo you like analog\nsynths?The correct answer\nis yes, and on her latest\nrelease composer Kaitlyn\nAurelia Smith proves\nthey\u2019re not just instruments for chin-stroking ac-ademics. The accessibility\nof The Kid is impressive,\nparticularly when Smith\u2019s\nweapon of choice remains\nher Buchla synthesiser.\nThe machine\u2019s organic\ntextures are melded into\na psychedelic pop-opera\ntracing out a cycle of birth,\nlife and death, all in the\nspace of less than an hour.\nArtist: Lil\u2019 Pump. Label:\nTha Lights Global/Warner\nBros. For Fans Of: Lil\u2019\nYachty; Lil\u2019 Uzi Vert; Chief\nKeef. Release Date: October\n6th\n. 36 minutes\nLIL\u2019PUMP\nMumble/Cloud/Soundcloud rap may have a\nreputation for trashy bars\nand rushed beats\u2026 but\nthat doesn\u2019t necessarily\nmean it\u2019s bad. Lil\u2019 Pump\nis crammed with guilty\npleasures. Gucci Gang\ncontains the lyric \u201cMy\nlean costs more than your\nrent\u201d. What more do you\nneed to know?\nArtist: Zi\u00far. Label: Planet\nMu/Objects Ltd. For Fans\nOf: Ellen Allien; Ash\nKoosha; Steffi. Release\nDate: October 6th\n. 41 minutes\nU FEEL\nANYTHING?\nTechno tends to stick\nto repetitive kick drums\nfor a reason. Having a\nrigid skeleton means\nyou can experiment with\ntexture until your ears\nbleed, but you\u2019re always\ngoing to find someone\nwilling to dance to it. Zi\u00far\nthrows this mantra out the\nwindow, instead opting\nfor cascades of sampled\ncrashes, hisses and\nscratches. Guest vocalists\nsometimes coast atop this\nto add to the chaos, completing a release certain to\nshake-up the Berlin scene.\nArtist: King Krule. Label:\nTrue Panther/XL. For Fans\nOf: The Pop Group; PJ\nHarvey; Fela Kuti. Release\nDate: October 13th\n. 66\nminutes\nTHE OOZ\nArchy Marshall\n(a.k.a. King Krule, a.k.a.\nZookid, a.k.a. Edgar the\nBeatmaker, a.k.a. DJ JD\nSport, a.k.a. The Return of\nPimp Shrimp) is a unique\nvoice in contemporary\nUK music. Raised in\nPeckham, his tales of woe\nin life and love are translated through the sounds\nof punk, jazz, hip-hop,\nblues, and afrobeat. The\nOOZ further broadens this\nscope of influences, but\nstill sounds greater than\nthe sum of its influences.\nFew artists can carve out\na unique sound nowadays,\nbut Marshall has proved\nhimself capable of this\ntime and time again.\n\u201cKaitlyn\nAurelia Smith\nmelds organic\ntextures into\na psychedelic\npop-opera,\ntracing out the\ncycle of life and\ndeath\u201d\n(Clockwise from top left) Kelela\u2019s Take Me Apart; Kaitlyn\nAurelia Smith\u2019s The Kid; Zi\u00far\u2019s U Feel Anything?; King\nKrule\u2019s The OOZ; Lil\u2019Pump\u2019s eponymous release // Warp;\nWestern Vinyl; Tha Lights Global/Warner; Planet Mu/Objects\nLtd.; True Panther/XL\nArtist: Floating Points.\nLabel: Pluto. For Fans Of:\nFour Tet; Caribou; James\nHolden. Release Date:\nOctober 19th\n. 19 minutes\nRATIO (12\u201d)\nIn 2015 Floating Points\nreleased Alaenia, a meticulously engineered masterpiece divorced from\ntime. Ratio sees him take\nthe experimentalism he\u2019s\nfocused on from Alaenia\nonwards, honing it into\na spectacular club opus.\nThe expansive 19 minute\nsingle carves out a middle\nground between his earlier\ndusty house tracks and\nhis more recent jazz-fu-sion experimentations.\nAnalogue synths wobble\nover a pulsing beat. The\ntrack constantly leaps\nforwards, anxious to reach\nthe next bar. A fantastic\npiece to round off any\ngreat night-out.\nArtist: Invisible Church\n& Marie Davidson. Label:\nYerevan Tapes. For Fans\nOf: Umfang; Karen Gwyer;\nWolfgang Voigt. Release\nDate: October 20th\n. 19\nminutes\nWHATEVER MAKES\nYOU FEEL SAFE (EP)\nQuebec native Marie\nDavidson takes a turn\naway from her starker\nEBM-revivalism on this\ncollaborative release\nwith Invisible Church.\nCrisp drums and synths\nare replaced with liquid\nelectronics and crackling\npercussion. Synths swell\nto give the impression\nof drowning. Davidson\u2019s\nvocals haunt the tracks,\noften being elongated\nor reversed, creating an\nambient techno sound too\nunsettling to be relaxing.\nArtist: Lee Gamble. Label:\nHyperdub. For Fans Of:\nBurial; Actress; Special\nRequest. Release Date:\nOctober 26th\n. 43 minutes\nMNESTIC\nPRESSURE\nDespite a disappointing\nlive set (reviewed in last\nweek\u2019s edition), Lee\nGamble has put together\na fantastic album, tying\ntogether over 30 years of\nthe UK underground. The\nmusic flutters between\na variety of bass-driven\nstyles. Dark ambient melts\ninto dub techno which\naccelerates into jungle. All\nof these elements are glued\ntogether by Gamble\u2019s\npeculiar approach to\ntexture, increasing the\naccessibility of his album\nwithout damaging its\nexperimentalism. \u2018Ghost\u2019,\nwith its masterful chops,\nmay stand as one of the\ngreatest jungle tracks\nreleased in the last decade.\nArtist: John Maus. Label:\nRibbon Music. For Fans Of:\nAriel Pink; Molly Nilsson;\nTonstartssbandht. Release\nDate: October 27th\n. 38\nminutes\nSCREEN\nMEMORIES\nSix years on from\nhis last album, John\nMaus has built his own\nmodular synthesiser\nand completed a PhD in\npolitical philosophy. Both\nof these advances serve\nas a bedrock for Screen\nMemories. Maus\u2019 music\noften sounds like in-uni-verse pop music from a\ntrashy 80s cyberpunk TV\nserial. But he deftly uses\nthis minimalist new-wave\nsound to provide a\nretro-futuristic protest\nagainst our own dystopian\nshade of hypercapitalism.\nBecause is our reality\nreally that different from\n80s science-fiction at this\npoint?\nArtist: Fever Ray. Label:\nRabid Records. For Fans\nOf: Alice Glass; Bj\u00f6rk;\nR\u00f6yksopp. Release Date:\nOctober 27th\n. 47 minutes\nPLUNGE\nKarin Dreijer\u2019s has\ndominated the sounds of\n21st century pop simply by\nbeing herself. Her twisted\nelectropop compositions,\nboth as brother-sister duo\nThe Knife and as solo act\nFever Ray, have made pop\nweird again. Plunge serves\nas just another bullet point\non an already impeccable\nCV. Moving away from\nthe themes of isolationism\nand motherhood of her\nself-titled debut, Fever\nRay\u2019s sophomore release\nis an exclaimed worship\nof all things kinky. Sex,\nflesh and leather are orchestrated as pitch-shifted\nlayers of vocals, frantic ar-peggiators, and bombastic\npercussion. Lyrics about\nthe mundanities of life are\nreplaced with expressions\nof carnal desire which\nDreijer somehow makes\nsound deeply moving. If\nthere\u2019s one album from\nthis year worth hearing,\nPlunge is undoubtedly it.\n\u201cJohn Maus\nprovides a\nretro-futuristic\nprotest against\nhypercapitalism\u201d\n(Clockwise from top right) Fever Ray\u2019s Plunge; Lee Gamble\u2019s Mnestic Pressure; Floating Point\u2019s Ratio; Invisible\nChurch and Marie Davidson\u2019s Whatever Makes You Feel\nSafe; John Maus\u2019Screen Memories. // Rabid/Mute; Hyperdub; Pluto; Yerevan Tapes; Ribbon Music\n\n"

The venue\nincludes the \u2018Reach Out\nMakerspace\u2019, which\nallows young people to\nhave access to equipment\nfor design and manu-facturing, and will host\ncollaborative programmes\nwith schools from the local\narea, teaching them how\nto develop and produce an\nidea.\nThe Invention Rooms\nwill also play host to\nthe Imperial College\nwill be more hotly contested in future, hopefully\nhelping to attract better\nquality candidates.\u201d\nThe College said that\nthis decision was made \u201cin\nrecognition of the valued\ncontribution that the GSU\nPresident makes to enrich\nthe experiences of postgraduate students, as well\nas the responsibility and\ntime-commitment that the\nrole involves.\u201d\nIn a statement, a Union\nrepresentative told Felix:\n\u201cImperial College Union\nGSU stipend raises funding questions for other CUs\nand the Graduate Students\u2019\nUnion work in partnership\nwith the College\u2019s Graduate School to improve\nthe experience of our\npostgraduate members.\nThe value of this collaboration is demonstrated\nby the Graduate School\u2019s\ncommitment to provide an\nannual stipend to the GSU\nPresident to enable them\nto work even more effectively on behalf of their\nmembers as well as continue on their research.\u201d\nIt is not clear what this\ndevelopment will mean\nfor the Presidents of other\nConstituent Unions (CU).\nCurrently, the only paid\npositions are the GSU\nPresident, and the Imperial College School of\nMedicine Students Union\n(ICSMSU) President, who\nis an elected sabbatical\nofficer. Felix spoke to a\nnumber of CU Presidents,\nwho said that they would\nbe interested to see what\nit means for their roles:\nClaudia Caravello, President of the City and Guilds\nCollege Union (CGCU)\nsaid \u201cI think it will be\nexciting to see how this\ngoes. While the position is\na voluntary role, it is very\ntime demanding, regularly\nexceeding the hours the\nUnion expects of a vol-unteer, making it hard to\nhold down other part-time\njobs. Being paid ensures\nthat the GSU President\ncan do their job to the best\ncapacity without having\nto compromise their own\npersonal life too much.\u201d\nMichael Edwards, President of Royal College of\nScience Union (RCSU),\ntold Felix \u201cI welcome\nthis development and\napplaud the Union and\nGraduate School for this\nvital change identifying a\nsignificant student leader.\nI look forward to opening\ndiscussions of my own\nwith the Union and the\nFaculty of Natural Sciences to negotiate a similar\narrangement.\u201d\nHowever, a Union\nrepresentative told Felix\nthat \u201cneither Imperial\nCollege Union or any\nCollege faculties has\nplans to make any other\nConstituent Union roles\npaid at this time. We are\nalways working to support\nour Constituent Unions\nas part of our ongoing\ncommitment to a strong\ndemocracy and are excited\nto see the conversations\nthis may start with other\nFaculties.\u201d\nImperial\u2019s Graduate\nSchool provides a number\nof professional skills\ncourses and coaching.\nThey say they aim to\nensure \u201call postgraduate\nstudents are provided with\nexcellent professional development training complementing their academic\nstudies and providing opportunity to develop skills\nfor a range of careers.\u201d\nThey also undertake research projects in higher\neducation studies, which\nguide College policy.\nNEWS\n(cont.)\nAdvanced Hackspace\n(ICAH).

Imperial\nCollege first bought land\nin White City back in\n2009; the northern half of\nthe campus was granted\nplanning permission in\n2012, and construction\nhas been progressing\nsince then. The Molecular\nSciences Research Hub is\nset to open in 2018, and\nwill provide a new home\nfor the Department of\nChemistry.\nThe campus is dominated by a 35-storey tower,\nwhich saw its topping out\nceremony in September.\nThe tower, whose \u00a376.2\nmillion contract was\nawarded to Laing O\u2019Rourke, will provide 133\nprivate housing units, and\n59 units available to Imperial \u2018key workers\u2019.

The\ngeneral idea \u2013 and I\u2019m\nparaphrasing here \u2013 is\nthat the students of today\nare too soft, and too\nmollycoddled, they\u2019re\n\u2018special snowflakes\u2019 who\ndon\u2019t understand the \u2018real\nworld\u2019.

Just this past week,\nwe\u2019ve had a couple of\narticles in our Comment\nsection that have prompted\na very strong reaction. I\nthink that this is a great\nthing \u2013 the reactions we\nget to our Comment pieces\nshows that the stereotype\nof apathetic Imperial\nstudents is not the case.\nWith that in mind, I\nwant to make an appeal\nto any students who\nare outraged or upset\nat things we publish:\nplease get involved!\nDrop us an email, write\na response article, start a\nconversation. Felix is only\nbiased in one way, and\nthat\u2019s towards those who\nactually write for us \u2013 we\ncan\u2019t promote your views\nif you don\u2019t let us know\nwhat they are.\nHowever, if you\u2019re a\nmultinational tech giant,\nthen please stay out of\nmy inbox. Earlier this\nweek, we published an\nonline-only long-read by\nour Politics Editor Avi\nBanerjee, about the rise\nof the tech monopolies.\nIn the piece, which is\nabsolutely fantastic, Avi\ndescribes the rise of tech\ngiants like Facebook and\nGoogle, and compares\nthem to the monopolies\nthat existed in America\nduring the Gilded Age.\nBack then, the dangers\nof such powerful organisations was recognised,\nand they were broken up,\nbut today we seem to be\nsleepwalking into exactly\nthe same situation.\nOne of the companies he\nmentioned was Amazon.\nYou know, the place you\nget all your worldly goods\nfrom, who pay a miniscule\namount of tax in proportion to their size, and who\n\u2013 I would argue \u2013 have\nput extreme pressure on\nindependent booksellers\nand music stores. The\narticle wasn\u2019t even up\nonline for 12 hours before\nI got a voicemail and an\nemail from someone in\nthe Amazon press office,\nasking I get in touch with\nthem as soon as possible.\nIt seems they\u2019d taken issue\nwith some of the things\nwe\u2019d published, and asked\nfor clarifications.\nThe guy I spoke to was\nperfectly nice, but the\nwhole thing was extremely unsettling \u2013 if they can\nget in touch less than 12\nhours after an article has\ngone online, from a small\nstudent paper (we\u2019d like\nto big ourselves up, but\nhey, we\u2019re small fry), then\nI doubt they\u2019d have any\nqualms about beginning\nlitigation. The article has\nsince been taken down,\npending amendments, but\nit will be back up very\nsoon, and I urge you all\nto check it out. In many\nways, this just proves\nAvi\u2019s point that the tech\ngiants could soon stifle\nanything that resembles\ncriticism of their business\npractices.\nIn the meantime, I know\nwhere my Xmas presents\nare going to come from:\nmy local independent\nshops, with nary a delivery\ndrone in sight.\n2\n2\nListen to the Felix Podcast!\nFelix have teamed up with IC Radio\nto bring you a weekly round-up of\nall the news, plus interviews with\ncontributors and editors.\nTune in at\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/ICRadioPodcasts/\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\nFRIDAY, 3RD\nNOVEMBER, 2017 FELIX ISSUE 1674\nFELIX\n26 27\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk FOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGrub\u2019s up! Felix Food\u2019s guide to campus food\nIt\u2019s just gone midday, campus is heaving, and you\u2019ve got a fiver burning a hole in your pocket. Let our Food Editors\nAlice Davage and Chun Yuan Hii take you on a culinary tour of where to get some decent food.\nOne of the few locations on campus that actually serves barista coffee. Perfect for\nthose all night study sessions when the instant (well, automatic-machine produced)\ncoffee that is most commonly found on campus just doesn\u2019t satisfy the needs of the\ncaffeine addicts. They are easily spotted in a crowd: look out for the people that walk\naround campus like zombies if denied their daily fix. Thank God the Library Caf\u00e9 is\nopen until 23:00 on weekdays. Lots of last minute lab reports and group work would\nsuffer were it not.\nTheir range of sugary treats is also surprisingly good. My personal\nfavourite is the red velvet cheesecake. It is, however, deceptively named: it is in fact\na (delicious) red velvet cake with the buttery biscuit base of a cheesecake (subtle\nthrowback to that vintage meme). Admittedly, the name \u2018red velvet cake:cheese-cake hybrid\u2019may be too long to fit on a label, so I\u2019ll forgive the mislabelling on this\noccasion and praise the culinary creativity instead. The triangular chocolaty, nutty,\nfruity, caramelly things are also yummy.\nIf you find yourself staying back unexpectedly late on campus (poor you), you\nmay be heading to the Library Caf\u00e9 to fill a hole in your rumbling stomach. For best\nvalue for money, opt for a jacket potato. Warming, filling, and cheaper than buying\na sandwich if you choose to only have butter with it (costing just over \u00a31). The full\nmeals are far more expensive, costing in excess of \u00a34.\nShout-out to the staff who make an effort to decorate the place for special occasions. This\nweek you will find a real Halloween pumpkin on top of the dessert glass cabinet and spider web paper chains\nhanging up. Cheers for that.\n2. LIBRARY CAF\u00c9\nA popular lunch venue for students of all disciplines, not just the medics and life scientists (yes, it is their building\ntoo). Although, this is mainly due to the lack of needing an ID card to enter the building and the comfy sofas\nhidden behind the staircase. Its popularity has led to massive queues at lunchtime. So a word of advice, buy your\nfood before the stampede of medic freshers descend the front staircase at 12 o\u2019clock and please, oh please, have\nyour ID card ready at the till.\nThe coffee machines have had an upgrade since last year and with it comes an upgrade in prices too. Personally, I think the fancier machines are worth the slight added cost. The coffee tastes better and the cappuccinos have\nbetter foam. Plus, the hot chocolate, weirdly named \u2018dark chocolate\u2019, is very rich and therefore better than most\nmachine hot chocolates, which can be tasteless/taste of powder, if powder can have a taste.\nFor the healthier amongst you, the SAF Caf\u00e9 also sells a range of smoothies. One of them features kale. No\nsurprises there really.\nA friend of mine made the following bold claim, \u201cthe cheese Cornish pasty is better than Greggs.\u201d\n5. SAF CAF\u00c9\nJust for postgrads, so sadly\nI have never eaten here. Apparently, the lecturers eat here to avoid\nbumping into their students over\nlunch. Fair enough.\n4. H-BAR\nPeople are still bitter about the\nremoval of cooked breakfast.\n3. SCR\nThe canteen with blue tables has a standard deli selling fancy baguettes and a\ncanteen with all the normal lunch grub (boxed sandwiches, crisps, etc.).\nPieminster sells gourmet pie and mash. A little pricey but sometimes they do\ndiscounts so look out for those. They offer a range of gravy, including vegetarian and red wine flavoured. Apparently, \u201cthe mash is lit\u201d \u2013 not my words.\nI pretty much survived off the steamed buns that Far East sold for \u00a31.80ish\nduring first year. Cheap, filling, and healthy. So popular that it always had a\nridiculously long queue at lunchtime filled with loyal customers. I am sad to\nsay that Tanpopo has now replaced it, which is good in its own right, but just\nnot the same. The snacks, such as Gyoza (Japanese dumplings), will set you\nback about \u00a32.50. For a more filling lunch you can pick up some Katsu curry or\nteriyaki salmon, which of course is more pricey than the snacks, but perhaps worth it\nif you\u2019re a big Katsu fan. Tanpopo also display their menu on TV screens: how high-tech of them.\n1. JCR\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n5\n8\n9\n11\nThe overflow caf\u00e9 for business\nschool students when they want to\nbranch out from their underground\nBusiness School Caf\u00e9 next to\nthe metal cylinder. It has outside\nseating on Dalby Court, which is\nwell-used when the sun is shining\nand therefore not very often. Good\nbarista coffee.\n10. COLLEGE CAF\u00c9\n2-course meal for \u00a36?\nQueens Tower Room is famed for its value for money \u2013 where\nelse could you get a main, a side, a drink and a dessert/soup for\nunder a tenner? There are several counters: Wok, Main, and Copper\nPots, where they sell differently themed food. Quick review: Wok is\nedible but meh, rice from Copper is disgusting, criss cross fries are\namazing. The desserts are the best part \u2013 all the cakes and fruit bowls\nyou can choose from. QTR\u2019s daily menus are posted on Imperial\u2019s\nwebsite and a great way to try to stay awake in a boring lecture is\nbrowsing through them. Thinking about lunch will keep you awake.\nWait, maybe that\u2019s not such a good idea\u2026\nWhat\u2019s that queue for? You might have never heard of it before, but I\nbet you\u2019ve seen the long queue snaking out of a little outlet right opposite\nthe Union shop, squeezed between JCR and SCR. Aptly called Fusion,\nthis shop sells a variety of Western and Eastern food with a heavy Indian\nnote. Meal options include pasta, fried rice, and biryani rice. If you\u2019re a\nvegetarian, fret not: vegetarian dishes are served every day, varying from\narrabbiata penne to pilau rice with lentil curry. The menu changes every\nday so you\u2019ll never get bored! A box costs \u00a33.95 and you can mix and\nmatch whichever dishes tickle your fancy, even if it\u2019s pouring a spoonful of\nchicken curry over the creamy pasta. No judgement at all. Sandwiches and\nwraps are also available and will be toasted on order. Favourites include\nbeef pasta bake, coconut rice, and shashlik wraps.\n9. FUSION 54\nSimilar to the union but with\na classier vibe and a bit more\nexpensive. If you fancy a break\nfrom the chaos of the union and\nhave the urge to eat somewhere\nwith a more defined restau-rant-like ordering system, then\nEastside may just be the place\nfor you.\n7. EASTSIDE\n8. QUEENS TOWER ROOMS\nThey sell a large range of food from curries to burritos. The cheesy curly fries have\na cult following. Members of arts societies that rehearse in Beit practically live off\nthem. It was actually suggested that I write \u201cAn Ode to Curly Fries\u201d to accompany\nthis article; not this week I\u2019m afraid, but watch this space. The nachos come covered in\na mountain of dip and cheese. I am rarely able to finish the nachos-for-one myself, and\nusually end up sharing it with friends who eagerly reach for the bowl when I admit defeat,\nso I can\u2019t imagine how big the nachos-for-two is. How do they fit it in a bowl?\nRemember your table number when you go to the bar to order and bring your ID card. They will ask to\nsee it and it is no fun pushing back through groups of people in order to fetch it from your bag, just to dive\nback through the throngs to return to the bar.\n11. BEIT: 568/UNION BAR\nUnfortunately, the farmer\u2019s market only takes over the area around the Queen\u2019s Tower\non Tuesdays, but I thought it deserved a mention regardless. Calling it a \u201cfarmer\u2019s\u201d\nmarket is a bit of a stretch as it doesn\u2019t sell very much fresh farm produce i.e. fruit\nand veg. Instead, it sells fancy lunch street food (similar to the food markets found\nat Camden Lock and by the live music venue on Portobello Road), which we all\nprobably prefer anyway, so no harm done. Like most trendy markets, there is a bias\ntowards organic, vegan, and gluten free food.\nIt can at first seem a bit expensive, but most of the portion sizes for meals are big,\nparticularly for the curries, paella, and other foods cooked in a wok. So either go hungry\nor share with a friend is my advice. It also offers seasonal food, for instance the autumnal\npumpkin lasagne, which has an oddly sweet edge but is balanced with savoury parmesan cheese which\nsomehow works. The pizza is tasty but messy, so get a paper plate and sit down; otherwise, you are going\nto end up with toppings all over your t-shirt.\n6. FARMER\u2019S MARKET\n7\n10\n\n"

FUTURE is\na seventeen-track trap\noffering that went straight\nto number one in its\nfirst week. However,\nalthough Future\u2019s fans\nwere satisfied, Future was\nnot. A mere seven days\nlater, Future went on to\ndo the unheard of and\ndropped his sixth album,\nHNDRXX. Future shows\nhis more sensitive side on\nHNDRXX and the album\nalso debuted atop the\nBillboard charts. In having\ntwo different albums\ndebut at number one in\nconsecutive weeks, Future\naccomplished a feat that\nno other artist in music\nhistory has. He swiftly\nfollowed up this success\nby announcing the Future\nHndrxx Tour, which concluded in London\u2019s O2\nArena last Monday.\nFuture had Zoey Dollaz,\nRich The Kid, and Stefflon\nDon in support but all\nthree acts failed to sufficiently raise the crowd\u2019s\nenergy levels. The crowd\nwas subsequently restless\nby the time Future took to\nthe stage (20 minutes late,\nI might add). However,\nFuture turned things\naround with his strong\nopening performance\nof FUTURE album cut,\n\u2018Draco\u2019. Future has built\na reputation as an artist\nwith a seemingly tireless\nwork ethic, dropping\nmixtapes and albums at an\nalarmingly rapid rate over\nthe last 5 years. There was\nalso a period when Future\nwas hip-hop\u2019s go-to guy\nfor a hook or feature and,\nas a result, the man simply\nhas an insurmountable\nmass of music to perform.\nHe had the whole arena\nrocking with fan favourites \u2018Thought It was a\nDrought\u2019, \u2018Stick Talk\u2019,\nand \u2018Sh!t\u2019.\nAlthough this show\nwas supposedly in support\nof his two 2017 albums,\nFuture effectively turned\nit into a showcase of his\ngreatest hits, stretching all\nthe way back to the start\nof his career. It was disappointing that he didn\u2019t\nin the arena but, instead,\nFuture bombarded us with\nhigh energy bangers all\nnight. There were times\nwhen Future appeared\nto be lacking energy\nbut he performed with\nfour dancers who hyped\nthe crowd during those\nperiods when he was\nstruggling to keep up. He\nalso brought Rich The\nKid, Stefflon Don, and\nWizkid out during his set,\nwith Wizkid in particular\nreceiving a rapturous\nreception. Future returned\nto perform \u2018Mask Off\u2019,\nhis viral smash hit off of\nFUTURE and ended his\nset with \u2018March Madness\u2019\n(arguably the best song\nof all time). Overall, the\nshow was fun but there\nwere times when the\nenergy felt a bit lifeless\nand it raises the question\nof whether it\u2019s worth\nseeing artists like Future,\nwho have countless high\nenergy bangers but whose\nmusic arguably lacks sub-stance, in concert. In this\ncase, I would have to say\nno \u2013 save your \u00a355.\nperform any of HNDRXX\nas this would have been\na welcome switch of vibe\n\u201cThere\nwere times\nwhen Future\nappeared to\nbe lacking\nenergy, but\nhe performed\nwith dancers\nwho hyped the\ncrowd\u201d\nGet involved with Felix!\nWe\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, illustrators, grammar nerds, and\ncomputer whizz-kids\nIf you\u2019re interested, drop us a line on felix@ic.ac.uk\nFuture keeping the vibe alive at the O2 // Andy Djaba\n\n"

As Fellini reportedly said: \u201cNever trust a\nwoman who doesn\u2019t like\nto eat. She is probably\nlousy in bed.\u201d\nLuca Guadagnino is\na filmmaker well versed\nin the erotic qualities of\nfood and eating: his 2009\nbreakthrough I am Love\nbegins with an elaborate\ndinner being prepared\nat the house of Emma\nRecchi, a Russian emigre\nto Milan who has married\ninto a wealthy industrial\nfamily. The film then takes\nus through a technicolour\nwhirlwind of delicate\ndishes, which serve both\nas drivers of the plot and\nas conveyors of sensuality,\nas Emma begins an affair\nwith a chef, Antonio.\nFood took on lesser but\nstill central role in his\nfollow-up, A Bigger\nSplash, where Guadagnino swapped out the bustle\nof the city for sun-baked\nisland of Pantelleria,\nlocated between Sicily\nand Tunisia. However,\nA Bigger Splash, which\ntook its inspiration from\nJacques Deray\u2019s thriller La\nPiscine, was a dry piece\nof filmmaking, as flat and\nsun-baked as its island\nsetting.\n\u201cAs in\nGuadagnino\u2019s\nprevious work,\nfood takes on a\nstarring role\u201d\nIn comparison, Call\nMe by Your Name, which\nis based on the novel by\nAndr\u00e9 Aciman and forms\nthe final instalment of\nGuadagnino\u2019s \u2018Desire\u2019\ntrilogy, is near-obscene\nin its fecund vibrancy.\nTaking as its setting a\nsumptuous villa in the\nnorthern Italian countryside during an early-80s\nsummer, Call Me by Your\nName tells of the growing\nattraction between Elio\n(Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), a\nprecocious 17-year-old\nwith a talent for music, and\nOliver (Armie Hammer),\na graduate student in his\nmid-20s, who comes to the\nvilla to assist Elio\u2019s father\nLyle (Michael Stuhlbarg)\nin research.\nFood again takes on a\nstarring role, standing in\nfor thwarted desires and\ntempestuous attraction,\ntaking on a fetishistic-like\nquality: soft-boiled eggs\nspray bright orange yolk\nacross starched tablecloths\nwhilst mounds of ripe\napricots pile up in bowls,\nto say nothing of a certain\nscene involving a peach,\nwhich set the internet\nchattering last month.\nMusic also plays a key\nelement in Call Me by\nYour Name, as it did in\nhis last two films: John\nAdams returns, evoking\nthe marriage between his\nminimalist bombast and\nGuadagnino\u2019s well-tem-pered camera that caused\ngreat effect in I Am Love,\nbut the soundtrack on the\nwhole is softer, and more\npiano-led. Sufjan Stevens\ncontributes with an alternative take on his haunting\ntrack Futile Devices,\nadding to the affective\natmosphere.\nHammer continues the\nindie run he has enjoyed\nwith Free Fire and Nocturnal Animals, delivering\na performance that is\nbrimming with confidence\nand energy, yet conceals\nhidden depths. Even more\nengaging, however, is\nChalamet\u2019s turn in the\nfilm; his Elio is sensitive\nand vulnerable, tentatively\ncaught between adolescence and adulthood. Chalamet\u2019s features perfectly\nresemble those of Greek\nstatuary, but any concerns\nthat he might have been\nchosen for his looks rather\nthan his skill are quickly\ndashedaway,ashedelivers\nan emotionally-rich\nperformance. Both have\nbeen tipped for Academy\nAward success later in\nthe year, and for good\nreason. The supporting\ncast is small, but Michael\nStuhlbarg is captivating as\nElio\u2019s father, delivering an\nemotive speech at the end\nof the film that forms the\nheart of the two-hour-long\nwork.\nIn a number of ways,\nCall Me By Your Name,\nwith its sun-dappled,\nnorthern Italian location,\nand its air of insouciance\nand endless days, brings\nto mind Vittorio de Sica\u2019s\nThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis, adapted from\nGiorgio Bassani\u2019s 1962\nnovel. While Call Me by\nYour Name doesn\u2019t have\nthe ominous threat of\nFascism in the background\n\u2013 which draws shadows\nacross the life of the\nJewish family in de Sica\u2019s\nfilm \u2013 there are similar\nthemes centring around\nthe loss of innocence:\nGuadagnino has spoken of\nthe decision to transpose\nthe events of the original\nnovel from 1987 to 1983,\na year in which he argues\n\u201cthe \u201970s are killed, when\neverything that was great\nabout the \u201970s is definitely\nshut down.\u201d And thus\nthe summer of Call Me\nby Your Name must also\ninevitably come to an end,\nwith a winter scene at\nthe end of the film that is\nastonishing in its intensity.\nWith Call Me by Your\nName, Guadagnino\nreturns to the northern\nItalian climate where his\ninspiration grows best. It\u2019s\na coming-of-age tale that\navoids all the trite cliches\nfound in other films; an adaptation of a much-loved\nbook that has managed to\nretain all the wonder that\nmade Guadagnino one to\nwatch when he released I\nAm Love. It\u2019s a postcard\nfrom an eternal summer,\nthe kind that you only\nmiss once it\u2019s gone \u2013 rich\nand heady and full of raw\nemotion.\n\u201cI saw Armie Hamer was wearing a Star of David pendant, so I bought a Star of David pendant\u201d // Sony Pictures Classics\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Luca Guadagnino.\nScript: Luca Guadagnino;\nJames Ivory; Walter\nFasano. Starring: Timoth\u00e9e\nChalamet; Armie Hammer;\nMichael Stuhlbarg; Amira\nCasar. 130 minutes\nCALL ME BY YOUR\nNAME\nAn exercise in unremitting tension and horror\nYorgos Lanthimos returns with The Killing of a Sacred Deer, which cements his reputation as a master of unease\nFILM\nI\nt seems that for Greek\ndirector Yorgos\nLanthimos, who\ndirected Dogtooth\nand The Alps before\nmaking his move into\nEnglish-language cinema\nwith 2015\u2019s The Lobster,\nthe term \u2018clinical\u2019 may\nbe a compliment. Since\nhis breakout feature\nback in 2009, Lanthimos\nhas ploughed the same\nfurrow, excelling in cold,\nflat affect and a unique-ly-awkward dialogue he\ncreates with writer and\nfrequent collaborator\nEfthymis Filippou. It may\nbe described as detached,\ncerebral, or, perhaps,\n\u2018clinical\u2019. In The Killing of\na Sacred Deer, Lanthimos\npicks up this descriptor\nand runs with it, opening\nthe film with a direct shot\ninto the chest cavity of\na man undergoing open\nheart surgery; his ribs are\ncracked open, jacked apart\nwith a retractor, revealing\na grotesquely pumping\nheart, almost obscene in\nits perpetual motion. The\nwhole scene, in classic\nLanthimos fashion, is\nsoundtracked to Schubert.\nThe bloody gowns\nand gloves are removed,\nrevealing Colin Farrell,\nin a spotless button-down\nand fancy watch. But this\nis not the warm Farrell\nof Winter\u2019s Tale, nor the\ngruff and grizzled Farrell\nof The Beguiled or In\nBruges, oh no. This is the\nquietly rational Farrell of\nThe Lobster, a figure who\nonly comes out under the\nwatchful eye of Lanthimos\u2019camera. He is playing\nSteven, a cardiac surgeon,\nwho lives in a beautiful\ndetached house with his\nophthalmologist wife\nAnna (Nicole Kidman),\nand their two children,\nKim (Raffy Cassidy) and\nBob (Sunny Suljic).\nHowever, things are\nnot all right in paradise,\nand soon Martin (Barry\nKeoghan) comes onto\nthe scene \u2013 a strange and\ndelivers a horrifying piece\nof news to him: either he\nmust kill one of his family\nmembers, or they will all\nbegin to wither away and\ndie before his very eyes.\nThe choice is his.\nKidman, who has for\na number of years been\nperfecting an exacting,\nglacial persona (which\nshe has the skill to turn\noff at any minute \u2013 see her\nperformance in last year\u2019s\nLion for proof), comes\ninto her own in the role\nof Anna. Lanthimos pulls\noff a similar trick to what\nhe achieved with Rachel\nWeisz in The Lobster,\nlimiting an actor\u2019s emotional palette so they must\ngo deep rather than broad.\nKeoghan is similarly\naffecting, delivering a performance with an uncanny\nsense of otherness and\nnaturalism: he is here to\ndisrupt simply because\nthat is in his nature.\nWhile Dogtooth\nand The Lobster were\nbroadly comedies \u2013 jet-black comedies with a\nnerve-wrenching intensity\nthat set the teeth on edge\nperhaps, but comedies\nnone the less \u2013 The Killing\nof a Sacred Deer veers\nmuch closer to horror.\nThere may be comedic\nelements, most notably in\nFilippou\u2019s script, but at its\nheart the film is an exercise\nin relentless tension and\nbody horror. This intensity\nis aided and abetted by the\nsoundtrack, built heavily\naround the haunting works\nof Russian composer Sofia\nGubaidulina, which are\nreliant on shrieking strings\nand ratcheting stabs of\naccordions.\nIn The Killing of a\nSacred Deer, Lanthimos\nis drawing on a deeper\nand darker wellspring\nof inspiration than ever\nbefore. The title refers to\nthe Greek tragedy of King\nAgamemnon, who \u2013 upon\nkilling a deer and angering\nthe goddess Artemis \u2013\nmust kill his daughter if he\nwants his ships to sail to\nTroy. Lanthimos is telling\non the role of Artemis,\nin reality he is more akin\nto the Greek chorus,\ncommenting on the action\nwithout influencing it.\nSteven may believe that\nbluster and brute force\nmay allow his family to\nescape their curse, but in\nreality there is only one\nsolution: an inescapable\nethical decision whose\nendpoint is a bullet, lodged\nin the sternum of a family\nmember.\nIn many ways, The\nKilling of a Sacred Deer\nreminds me of Jonathan\nGlazer\u2019s Under the Skin,\nnot only for the similarities in the score \u2013 although\nGubaidulina\u2019s work is far\nmore intense \u2013 but in the\nway both films reflect\nhuman behaviour back at\nthe audience, in a way that\ncauses a profound discom-fort. In Lanthimos\u2019 work,\nthe dialogue appears like\na paranoiac\u2019s imitation of\nhuman speech; it\u2019s like a\nfunhouse mirror projecting back a simulacrum of\nlanguage.\nIf Greek drama can\nteach us anything, it is\nthat violence rarely means\nthe end of the story: in\nThe Oresteia, Aeschylus\u2019\nretelling of the story of\nIphigenia, Agamemnon\u2019s\nactions result in his death\nat the hands of his wife\nClytemnestra, who is\nkilled in turn by their son\nOrestes. While Lanthimos\ndoes not end the film with\nmore overt violence, it\nis clear that the events of\nthe film will exact a form\nof psychic pain upon the\nfamily. Similar feelings\nwill be evoked in the\naudience. The Killing\nof a Sacred Deer is not\nan enjoyable watch, but\nin the most interesting\nand \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 enjoyable way. It does what\nall great horror films do,\nand delivers a shock, one\nakin to being left in an\nicy bath: while the initial\nchill might fade, the cold\nremains in the marrow,\ndeep inside the viewer.\nNicole Kidman is one BAMF // A24\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Yorgos Lanthimos.\nScript: Yorgos Lanthimos;\nEfthymis Filippou.\nStarring: Colin Farrell;\nNicole Kidman; Barry\nKeoghan; Raffey Cassidy\n121 minutes\nTHE KILLING OF A\nSACRED DEER\n\u201cKidman, who\nhas perfected\na glacial\npersona,\ncomes into her\nown as Anna\u201d\noff-putting teenager, who\ncrashes down on the family\nlike a giant, menacing\ncuckoo. He is intimately\nlinked to Steven, and\n\u201cThe tension\nis aided and\nabetted by the\nsoundtrack,\nwhich draws\nheavily on the\nwork of Sofia\nGubaidulina\u201d\na tale as old as human\ncivilization, of outcomes\npredestined to occur, of\ninescapable fated to which\ncharacters are drawn with\na steady inevitability.\nLike many protagonists\nof Classical drama, Steven\nis a man blinded by\ncowardice and a sense of\nself-importance, refusing\nto tell his wife about the\nterrifying prophecy until\nboth his children are made\nbed-bound.

Sunlight\nServices \u2013 the branch of\nCollege that deals with\nartificially manipulating\nthe weather \u2013 reported\nthat Imperial has finished\nconstruction on its sun-disk: a large circular solar\npanel, measuring 1.2 km\nin diameter, which will\nperpetually hover above\nthe South Kensington\ncampus.\nAs a result of the sun-disk, the College will\nbe cutting the available\nsunlight hours down to\nthree: sunlight will\nbe available between\n10-11am and 2-4pm each\nday. In a statement accompanying details of the\nchanges, the College made\nit clear that \u201csince our in-ception, Imperial has not\nmade any direct money\nout of the sun, so we are\nexcited for this new development.\u201d They also stated\nthat the new solar panel\nwould \u201cprovide all the\nenergy needed to power\nour world-class research,\nwhile also allowing us to\ndivest from fossil fuels.\u201d\nFelix spoke to Harry\nThibault, Vice Provost\n(Cloud-Seeding and\nSunshine), who explained\nthat the reduction in\ndaylight hours would\nbe a benefit to students:\n\u201cnumerous studies have\nfound that students will\ninnately seek warmth and\ncomfort. By reducing both\nthe levels of sunlight and\nthe temperature across\ncampus, students will be\ndriven by instinct towards\nthe warmest place on\ncampus: Imperial Central\nLibrary, which will be\nfloodlit at all times. We\npredict that these changes\nwill result in a sharp\nimprovement in exam\nresults.\u201d\nThe Deputy President\n(Welfare) will be distributing vitamin D tablets\nto all Constituent Union\nPresidents later this week,\nto avoid another outbreak\nof rickets across campus.\nAn artist\u2019s impression of what Imperial\u2019s sun-disk would look like // Flickr\n\n"

Top\nTracks: Last Night in LA;\nRobbery; Same Shit. For\nFans Of: Cadet; Yungen;\nNines. 78 minutes\n7 DAYS\n7 NIGHTS\nKrept & Konan abandon the London underground in\ntheir new mixtapes 7 Days and 7 Nights\nThe new work shows they\u2019re shifting towards the mainstream, but they haven\u2019t chosen the right direction.\nK\nrept and Konan,\nthe established\nrap duo from\nSouth London,\nput out a pair of albums\ntwo weeks ago in their\nfirst major releases since\ntheir return to the London\nmusic scene. The albums\nare drastically different in\nstyle: 7 Days feels more\nlike a compilation of\ntheir attempts at different\ngenres (with a few bangers\nthrown in), while 7 Nights\nis a collection of R&B\nslow jams. These albums\ndemonstrate a commitment to their departure\nfrom the underground\nscene to pursue mainstream success.\nFor background, the\npair started out in the\nLondon rap scene \u2013 a\ncouple of youngers in polo\nshirts rapping about gang\nlife in Thornton Heath.\nThese early tracks and\nfreestyles were angry and\ngritty; although not being\nheavily involved in gang\nactivities, they shared\nexperiences and stories of\nthe people around them.\nAnd these raw lyrics\n(often set to an American\nhip-hop beat, or, very\nrarely, a grime instrumen-tal) connected with some,\nand shocked others. The\nduo gained notoriety and\neventually became one of\nthe biggest names in the\nunderground London rap\nscene. Their lyrics were\nsmart and the wordplay\nwas clever, referencing\nmore and more obscure\nparts of London culture,\nendearing them to people\nsympathetic to their\nstruggle. They received\na lot of attention through\nYouTube channels like\nSBTV, and through their\nearly mixtapes, some of\nwhich attained notoriety\nin the mainstream.\nWhat really helped\nthem blow up was the\ntrack \u2018Don\u2019t Waste My\nTime\u2019, in particular the\nline \u201cExcuse my French,\nI ain\u2019t worried \u2018bout\nnothin\u2019\u201d, which brought\non an all-star remix with\nCoke Boys. The song\nto return to London with\ntheir original flow, with\nthe respect and weight of\nhaving made it globally.\nIn fact, you get some\nimpression of this on 7\nDays: the track \u2018Robbery\u2019,\nreleased last summer, felt\na lot like their old tracks.\nThe play on \u2018Jack in the\nBox\u2019 in the first verse\nand even the reference to\ntheir first mixtape were\nreminiscent of Krept\u2019s\nclever, cheeky wordplay.\nAnd when that came out, it\nfelt like they had a sort of\ngodfather status, putting\nthis unknown rapper Abra\nCadabra on, and surrounding themselves with the\nbest in the scene. The\npenultimate track, \u2018Last\nNight In LA\u2019 (which is my\nfavourite on the album,\nalso released a year ago),\nhad the sense that these\nlegends had returned to\ntheir domain, equipped\nwith better production and\na taste of fame. Konan\ntalks about their progression from the road to the\nstage, referencing the\npeople he made it with and\neven the beef with Church\nRoad.\nUnfortunately, the\nrest of the album doesn\u2019t\nmake sense. Krept starts\nrapping in a silly Vybz\nKartel style accent on\nthe \u2018Controlla\u2019-sounding\ndancehall track \u2018For Me\u2019,\nwhich I don\u2019t think he\u2019s\never done before, and is\ncertainly not known for.\nAnd \u2018WoWoWo\u2019, which\nthey are trying to push as\none of the main bangers\nof the album, has such\na dull, plain hook; even\nin the verses they keep\nrepeating those three\nmeaningless syllables.\nThe whole album feels\nlike they\u2019re just trying to\ncreate bangers in every\ngenre possible: trap,\ndrill, dancehall, afrobeat.\nAnything. Maybe they\u2019re\ntrying to hedge their bets\non current trends, or just\nchurning out generic\ntracks because it\u2019s easy,\nthis sense, it feels very lost\nand empty as an album\n\u2013 more like a top 11 UK\nmusic compilation.\n7 Nights is more\ntogether: the PARTYNEXTDOOR vibe combined\nwith Nines-style vocals\nruns throughout. Actually,\nit does feel a lot like Nines\u2019\n\u2018One Foot Out\u2019, even featuring the same vocalist\nHudson East heavily on\nboth albums (which feels\nlike a betrayal to their\narea). And the topics of\nthe tracks depart from the\nusual grimy gang stories to\nstories of ladies and their\npromiscuous relationships\nwith them. None of the\ntracks particularly stand\nout, but the consistent\ntheme and interesting\nfeatures don\u2019t make it a\nterrible album.\nI guess my main issue\nwith these albums is the\nfact that they have abandoned the London underground scene to pursue\nfame. It seems that they\nwant to change directions\nas artists to something\nmore suitable for main-stream, although they\nhaven\u2019t really chosen the\nexact direction yet. It\u2019s a\nshame as they are amazing\nlyricists, and it\u2019s frustrating that they chose to\nlimit their talent in a trade\noff for catchy hooks and\npalatable verses. They are\ndefinitely still in it for the\nhustle, which is admirable,\nand they have achieved a\ntremendous amount from\nhumble beginnings. But\nhopefully we\u2019ll still see\nthem on those Link Up TV\nfeatures now and then.\n\u201cWhile some\ntracks mark a\nreturn to their\noriginal flow,\nthe remainder\nof 7 Days\ndoesn\u2019t make\nsense\u201d\nbrought them worldwide\nattention, with the likes of\nFrench Montana, YG, and\nJeremih looking to col-laborate. From there, they\nsigned with Def Jam and\ndid a heavily trap-inspired\nalbum, with features from\nloads ofAmerican rappers,\nslowing down their flow to\nappeal to their global fans.\nAnd this worked for them\nin terms of popularity: the\ntrack \u2018Freak of the Week\u2019\nwas blowing up every-where, even if the signature Krept and Konan flow\nwasn\u2019t that prominent.\nSee, I thought after\nthe previous album in the\nStates, they were going\n\u201cMaybe Krept\n& Konan are\ntrying to\nhedge their\nbets on current\ntrends, but it\ndoesn\u2019t feel\nlike they care\nfor the quality\nof the music\u201d\nbut it certainly doesn\u2019t\nfeel like they care for the\nquality of the music. So in\nThe ting goes skrrrrrr... // Virgin EMI\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFRIDAY, 3RD\nNOVEMBER, 2017 FELIX\n8\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWant to make the world a better place?\nBecome an effective altruist\nEffective altruism is an approach to doing good that will help you maximise your impact on\nyour charitable goals\nCOMMENT\nLouie Terrill\nComment Writer\nM\nost of us\nwant to make\na difference\nand have\na positive impact. Even\nthe most selfish, mon-ey-and-status-seeking\nstudent has issues they\ncare about. However, in\nsuch a complicated world\nit\u2019s hard to know where\nto start. You may have a\ngood heart, but without\ndirection you might end\nup donating to the first\ncharity fundraiser who approaches you on the street.\nWhile this is definitely\nwell-intended, it\u2019s not\nalways the best option, as\nsome charities can do far\nmore good than others.\nThere are clearly other\napproaches to channelling\nyour good intentions, and\ncurrently one of the most\nsuccessful ones is effective altruism. Effective\naltruism is a movement\nthat applies evidence and\nreason to look for the best\nways of helping others. In\nother words, if altruism is\nthe idea that you should do\ngood, effective altruism is\nthe idea that you should do\nas much good as possible,\nbased on the best information available to you.\nEffective altruists\nconsider a variety of things\nwhen trying to achieve this\nlofty goal. It seems trivial\nto point out, but high-im-pact causes that make a\nbigger difference, all else\nbeing equal, are obviously\npreferable. Similarly,\ncauses in which progress\nis easier to achieve are\nbetter than ones where the\nsame achievements will\ntake longer and cost more.\nIn general, causes which\nare more neglected may\nbe better opportunities\nto do good, as they will\nbe further from the point\nof reaching diminishing\nreturns.\nA key theme here is that\nin order to do the most\ngood, one must first ask\nhow much good can be\ndone \u201con the margin\u201d, by\nadding another donation\nor hour of work on top of\nwhat each cause already\nreceives. This is much\nmore useful to individuals\ndeciding what to do with\ntheir own contributions. It\ncan be easy to assume that\nany do-gooding is good\nenough, but by taking\nthe time to consider the\noptions you can achieve\nso much more.\nFor example, if you care\nabout improving people\u2019s\nhealth, it\u2019s much easier to\nprevent well-understood\nwidely available.\nFor these reasons, the\nSchistosomiasis Control\nInitiative (SCI) here at\nImperial is considered by\nmany charity evaluators\nto be one of the most\ncost-effective charities\nin the world \u2013 1000s of\ntimes more cost-effective\nthan the average charity.\nThey provide deworming\npills donated by pharmaceutical manufacturers to\nthe regions that suffer the\nmost from this neglected\ntropical disease. This\nintervention has been the\nsubject of multiple studies,\nand the SCI are committed\nto rigorously evaluating its\neffectiveness.\nThat\u2019s not to say that\ndonating to SCI is definitely the best way to do good:\nfor example, the Against\nMalaria Foundation is also\nbelieved to have cost-ef-fectiveness in the same\norder of magnitude, but\nit\u2019s challenging to make\nthese estimates precise\nand reliable enough to tell\nwhich charity is definitively better.\nBoth of these charities assume that our\ntop priority should be\nthe health and physical\nwell-being of people alive\ntoday. Perhaps a key distinction between effective\naltruism and other social\nmovements is that EA\ndoesn\u2019t dictate the values\nyou should hold. Instead,\nthe focus is on helping\nyou to further your own\nvalues, whatever they may\nbe.\nIf you think animal\nlives are also worth preserving and improving,\nthen you may find that\nthe best way you can do\ngood is by working to end\nfactory farming, which\ncauses suffering on an\nindustrial scale. Beyond\npersuading people to go\nvegetarian, one promising\noption is to develop better\nmeat substitutes that can\nbe produced much more\nhumanely and outcompete\nthe farmed equivalent.\nOn the other hand, if you\nthink the lives of people in\nthe future are also worth\nconsidering, in addition\nto everyone alive today,\na common conclusion is\nthat it is very important to\npreserve human civilisa-tion. Depending on your\nevaluation of the different\nthreats and your own\ntalents, this could involve\nworking with emerging\ntechnologies in order to\nguide their development,\nfinding a job in government where you can\nimprove prevention and\nresponses to pandemics,\nor limiting catastrophic\nclimate change through\npolicy work.\nIn order to do the most\ngood you possibly can,\nyou must first decide on\nyour goals. Once you\u2019ve\ndone that, using scientific\nevidence effectively to\ninform your decisions can\nmake a big difference in\nhow much good you do,\nwhether it\u2019s by considering which career paths can\nhave the most impact, or\nby comparing the charities\nthat attempt to achieve\nyour goals. The effective\naltruism movement can\nallow you to save more\nlives and help more people\nthan you could ever have\nmanaged otherwise.\n\u201cUsing\nscientific\nevidence to\nevaluate your\ndonations can\nmake a big\ndifference\u201d\nconditions, and much\ncheaper to focus on doing\nso in the developing world\nwhere cheap medicine and\nhealth care aren\u2019t already\nNext time someone corners you outside SK station, ask about effective altruism //\nFlickr/Gary Knight\nThe Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) is one of the most effective charities // SCI\n\n"

And travelling\nis one of the best ways\nto do that, am I right? I\nassume you agree since\nyou\u2019re reading the Travel\nsection. Well, lucky for us\ntravellers, it\u2019s possible to\nvisit most European cities\nin just one weekend, since\nthe distances are relatively\nshort and flights are af-fordable. Just earlier last\nweek, Ryanair released\ntickets between the UK\nand some European destinations starting from just\n\u00a35 one way. The offer was\nvalid until midnight only,\nbut Ryanair releases such\ndeals from time to time, so\nit\u2019s possible to score cheap\ntickets if you keep an eye\nout.\nThere are plenty of\ninteresting weekend-trip\ndestinations, but this\ntime let\u2019s talk about\nRome \u2013 one of the most\nfascinating cities I\u2019ve\nvisited. I went there on\na cold weekend in early\nDecember last year. Well,\nit was cold in London,\nbut Rome welcomed me\nwith mild Mediterranean\nweather and unforgettable\nsights. What amazed me\nthe most were the majestic\nremains of ancient\nbuildings, distributed all\nacross the modern city and\nresponsible for its charm.\nImpossibly grand, they\nwere built without any\nmodern technology and\nmanaged to survive for\ncenturies.\nSince I arrived in Rome\non a Saturday afternoon\nand had to leave Sunday\nnight, I didn\u2019t have much\ntime to explore the city.\nBut I was determined\nto make the most of it\nand committed to a busy\nweekend. I wasn\u2019t going\nto miss out on anything\n\u2013 this might be my first\nand only time in Rome\nfor all I know! The very\nfirst place I visited was the\nVatican City \u2013 the smallest\ncountry in the world\nand home to the Pope. It\nboasts St. Peter\u2019s Basilica,\nthe Sistine Chapel, and\nmuseums with famous\nworks of art. Since the\nplace was closed for sightseeing on Sunday, I rushed\nto see everything on the\nshort Saturday afternoon\nI had left. Unfortunately,\nbeing a still-inexperienced\ntourist, I managed to fall\nstraight into a tourist trap.\nIt was one of those guided\nwalking tours, advertised\non the street: I was told\nthe lines to Vatican are\nvery long and there was no\nway I could see everything\nby the closing time. So I\ntour wasn\u2019t really worth it\n(or at least I was unlucky).\nThe guide would just\nmumble something,\nwhich was impossible\nto hear most of the time,\nand still didn\u2019t manage to\nshow us everything in the\nmuseums. So coming in\nlate and without a guide\nmight have been the same\nexperience, only much\ncheaper! Regardless, the\nVatican was very pretty\nand well worth seeing,\nespecially if you\u2019re into\nart. You can also participate in Sunday Mass with\nthe Pope in St. Peter\u2019s\nBasilica or Square. The\ntickets are free but need\nto be collected at the\nticket office in advance.\nHowever, the museums\nare closed on Sundays,\nexcept for the last Sunday\nof every month, when the\nentry is also free.\nBut my Sunday was\ndedicated to sightseeing\nin Rome. Coincidentally,\nI was there on the first\nweekend of the month,\nwhen entry to Coliseum\nis free. The queue was\nvery long but moved quite\nswiftly. The Coliseum was\nworth the wait anyway,\nespecially given the free\nentry, which also included\nentry to the Roman Forum\nand Palatine Hill. I also\nvisited the Museum of the\nRisorgimento that offers\na mesmerising panorama\nof the city. Since I had\nsome time left, I walked\nthe lively streets in the\ncity centre, and visited the\nfamous Trevi fountain and\nthe Pantheon on my way.\nHowever, the visit\n\u201cI arrived\nin Rome on\nSaturday, and\nleft on Sunday,\nso I was\ndetermined\nto make the\nmost of a busy\nweekend\u201d\ngave in and bought a \u20ac40\ntour instead, which was\nsupposed to let me cut the\nline and give me enough\ntime to look around\nproperly. However, the\nvariety of delicious pizzas.\nIt\u2019s more popular amongst\nthe locals than tourists and\nis therefore cheaper. Since\nthis place was close to the\nRiver Tiber, I completed\nmy trip by taking a walk\nalong the river and back to\nthe Coliseum, which was\nbeautifully lit up for the\nevening.\nBEWARE: tourist\ntraps! I cannot stress this\nenough. Street sellers are\nvery persistent and will\ndo anything to get your\nmoney. During my visit,\nmany were pestering the\ntourists in the queue to\nthe Coliseum, offering\nthe overpriced \u2018jumpthe-line\u2019 tickets, when\nthe entry was free that\nday anyway. Though the\ntours were real, it\u2019s still a\nhuge rip-off. But the most\ninfamous example is the\npeople aggressively trying\nto sell flowers, souvenirs,\ntoys, and whatnot to\nanyone passing by. If you\ntouch any of that, you\u2019ll\nbe pressured to pay. Some\nmight even start a friendly\nconversation with you, try\nto shake your hand and\nslip something in it, and\nthen demand money. So be\nvigilant and stay safe!\n\u201cI completed\nmy trip by\ntaking a walk\nalong the river\nTiber after a\nslice of pizza,\nand back to\nthe Coliseum,\nwhich was\nbeautifully lit\nup\u201d\nto Italy wouldn\u2019t be\ncomplete without feasting\non pasta and pizza.

She was bold\nand passionate; she stirred\nthe audience, received a\nstanding ovation, and later\nthe video of her speech\nwent viral. She was certainly much braver than\nme aged sixteen: to stand\nup in front hundreds of\npeople and communicate\nher views with such raw\nemotion is something that\nhas to be commended.\nHowever, while her convictions are honest, she\nmissed the point.\nShe described \u201cseas of\nspaced out, stressed out,\ndepressed kids\u201d where a\n\u201cgood half, if not more\u201d of\nthem have a mental illness.\nThis, she thought, is for\nthe most part down to the\nnew GCSE system, with\nnumbered grades, tougher\nmaterial, Ofsted, and of\ncourse \u2013 the government.\nThe Tories are out to ruin\nchildren\u2019s lives for the\nmany political gains that\nwill come of doing so. She\nmade a \u201ccall to arms\u201d on\nthe matter. Sharpen your\npitch forks and burn an\neffigy of Theresa May,\nthat kind of thing.\nWhat she completely\nbypassed is that the rise\nof mental health problems\n(that being a broad\numbrella term for such a\nmultitude of issues) is a\nglobal phenomenon, not\njust for children in formal\neducation but across\nthe entire demographic\nspectrum. Depression and\nanxiety in particular have\nseen the sharpest increase\nin recorded cases.\nAccording to the World\nHealth Organisation,\nbetween 1990 and 2013\nthe number of people\nsuffering with anxiety or\ndepression increased from\n416 million to 615 million\nworldwide. That\u2019s 8.1%\nof the world\u2019s population\nburdened with one of\nthese health issues in\n2013. No doubt that figure\nis higher now, but perhaps\nmost telling is the fact\nthat many of the nations\nblighted with these particular illnesses are those\nwhich generally have high\nliving standards. Those\nwhich should, theoreti-cally, have the happiest\npopulations. America is\nthe ultimate example; the\nworld\u2019s largest economy,\nyet 1 in 5 adults have\nmental health condition.\nJapan faces suicide rates\nof 70 per day. In South\nKorea, a country which\nhas fanatically adopted the\nwestern lifestyle, suicide\nis the leading cause of\ndeath for anyone between\nthe ages of 10 to 30.\nEuropean mental illness\naccounts for 20% of total\nhealth problems. This,\ntherefore, is a pandemic\nand it is affecting the most\ndeveloped, modernised\nnations first.\nWe all have a vague\nidea of the causes \u2013 social\nmedia, poor diet, 24 hour\nnews to name a few. In the\ncase of Lauren Stocks and\nher fellow 21st century\nclassmates, I would argue\nit\u2019s the internet, more\nspecifically social media,\nmaking them miserable.\nNo one finishes a day\nof staring at their phone\nwith a sense of accom-plishment. Satisfaction\nmaybe, but certainly not\nhappiness.\nStocks blames the\ngovernment for her generation\u2019s unhappiness, when\nin fact this is something\nfar beyond the scope of\ncurrent policy. The rise of\nsocial media, social pres-sures, social anxiety, is\nnot really Theresa May\u2019s\nfault. Yes, more could be\ndone by her government\nto mitigate the damaging\nimpacts of modern life.\nBut if there is to be a \u201ccall\nto arms\u201d against anyone,\nsurely it would be against\nthe Silicon Valley giants?\nOf course, Silicon\nValley can\u2019t be held responsible for every case\nof depression or anxiety.\nNobody could have anticipated the adverse effects\ntechnology and increased\ninterconnectivity can have\non a person. Equally, the\ngovernments of developed countries cannot be\ndemonised for failing to\ngrasp the full scale of the\nproblem. This is a new\nglobal issue which needs\nto be tackled by politi-The inability to put down your phone can have a serious negative impact // Flickr/Donna Cleveland\n\u201cThe increase\nin mental\nhealth issues\nis a global\nphenomenon\u201d\n\u201cUltimately\nthere need not\nbe political\npolarisation\nover mental\nhealth\u201d\ncians, spanning all parties,\nwho have a better working\nknowledge of modern\nmental health.\nUltimately there need\nnot be political polarisation over the matter, no\n\u201ccall to arms\u201d as Stocks\nwould urge. We need\nto be cooperating \u2013 not\njust from left to right,\nbut on an international\nlevel \u2013 to encourage more\ncollaborative research into\nthe detrimental impacts\nof the internet and the\nvessels through which it\nreaches people. We need\nto be helping those school\npupils, as described by\nLauren Stocks, to cope in\nthe online world in which\nthey have grown up.\nSelf-help books are absolutely terrible, and\nI\u2019ll fight them to the death\nEven if self-help books are well-written, and their authors are people with good intentions,\nthinking you know the best way I should live my life is offensive\nCOMMENT\nAnonymous\nComment Writer\nI\nn my three years at\nImperial I have had\nmany opportunities\nto be triggered\nby Felix\u2019s Comment\nsection \u2014 Brexit, two\ngeneral elections, and\nnumerous terrorist attacks\nhave produced articles that\nmanaged to properly rustle\nmy jimmies. The piece in\nlast week\u2019s issue, howev-er, extolling the virtues of\nself-help books managed\nto push me over the edge,\nand I felt compelled to\nrespond.\nI must confess that the\nonly self-help book I have\nread from cover to cover\nwas Bertrand Russell\u2019s\nThe Conquest of Happiness, arguably the first\nof its kind. Like all good\nself-help authors, Bertrand\nRussell struggled with\ndepression for most of\nhis life and decided that,\nhaving overcome it, he\nwas qualified to tell other\npeople how to live their\nlives. This was the 50\u2019s\nso it\u2019s filled with lots of\nlovely Freudian bollocks\nthat naturally passed as\ncommon-sense at the time.\nAll this is to say that\nwhile I would love to go\non a rant about how all\nself-help books are written\nby sinister people who\nwish to make money from\nother people\u2019s misery, I\nwant to say that calling\nthese books literature\nis misleading, since it\nimplies that they\u2019re worth\nreading, but I have no\ndoubt that some of them\nare well written.\nI do however have one\nquite justified gripe with\nself-help books, and that\nis that they imply that\nyou are not living your\nlife correctly: \u2018are you depressed?\u2019 they ask, \u2018well\nthat\u2019s because you\u2019re not\ndoing it right, you should\nbe meditating and trying\nto live in the moment.\nRead my book and I\u2019ll let\nyou in on THE secret.\u2019\nThis annoys me on one\nlevel because I dislike\npeople who are too sure\nof themselves. If someone\ntells you they know how\nyou should be living your\nlife, they almost certainly\ndon\u2019t and are, in all likeli-hood, a terrible person.\nBut more importantly,\nI dislike this because\nfeeling like I should be\nliving my life differently\nis the number one cause\nof me being unhappy.\nWhether I feel like I\nshould be spending more\ntime with my family,\nreading, or doing sports,\nthe feeling that I should\nbe doing something inevitably makes me sad. Selfhelp books feed on this,\ncreating a vicious cycle of\nmaking you feel bad about\nnot doing something, and\nthen selling you the cure to\nyour unhappiness, which\nyou inevitably don\u2019t do\nbecause not everyone has\ntime to go to retreats in\n\u201cIf someone\ntells you they\nknow how\nyou should be\nliving your life,\nthey almost\ncertainly don\u2019t\u201d\nTibetan monasteries.\nWhile I doubt the author\nwas serious about making\nself-help books compulsory reading at Imperial,\nfor the reasons outlined I\nwould fight such a move\nto the death if needs be.\nThankfully that won\u2019t\nhappen, so I can continue\nreading Private Eye and\nbeing miserable.\ndon\u2019t know much about\nany of these authors. I\nwish I could froth with\nrage describing the pseu-do-scientific bollocks\nthat riddles the pages of\nthese awful books, but I\nhave only skimmed over\na couple of them.

I\nwas prompted to write this\narticle because of a one-star Goodreads review of\nThomas Pynchon\u2019s The\nCrying of Lot 49. It began:\n\u201cA classic English\nmajors only book, aka\npeople like talking about\nthis book and that they\n\u2018get it\u2019 make you feel like\ntheir intellectual inferior.\u201d\nReaders and non-read-ers alike may describe\nbooks as dull; some refuse\nto approach \u2018classics\u2019\nsince they are dated\nwhilst others, like our\nreviewer, will not touch\nmodern literature because\nit is overcomplicated and\nself-congratulating. My\nhope is to show that often\nthese are not bad books but\nthey instead reveal fault in\nour way of reading them.\nEach of these descriptions veil a common\ncriticism: difficulty. To\nsay a book is dull is to say\nthat it is harder to absorb\nyourself in reading than\nin other media. Many old\nbooks are dated. Dickens\u2019\nvocabulary is unusual,\nhis settings Victorian, and\nhis ghosts are far from\nfrightening but his stories\nresonate today as they did\none hundred and ninety\nyears ago \u2013 A Christmas\nCarol was even adapted\ninto a movie by The\nMuppets! So datedness\nis not in itself a criticism\nbut instead hides the fear\nthat it is too difficult to\ndistill Dickens\u2019 stories\nfrom his language. Many\nmodern classics are\novercomplicated. Authors\nlike Pynchon have written\nbooks that stretch the definitions of a novel but these\nare often books where\ndifficulty is necessary in\ntheir aims.\nThere are bad books but\nin many cases the difficult\nbook is not written poorly.\nThe fault often lies with\nus in our approach to\nreading these books. For\nthis I return to my angry\nPynchon review which\nends with:\n\u2018If you enjoy art that\nmakes a statement, try\nthis book. If you enjoy\nbooks for the story they\ntell and the messages you\ncan extract from that story,\navoid this book. It\u2019s up to\nyou.\u2019\nGiventhegreatdiversity\nof authors and their books,\nthe greatest determining\nfactor for our enjoyment is\nhow well our expectations\nmatch the book we end up\nreading. The books I\u2019ve\nfound most difficult have\nnot been bad ones but\nones that were not right,\nat that time, for me. These\nbooks either challenge our\nexpectations of writing or\nchallenge our expectations\nof the world.\nNo one can read Harry\nPotter and Oliver Twist\nin the same way. To\nexpect to breeze through\nDickens at the pace you\nwould read Rowling is to\nset yourself up for disap-pointment. He is not so\nhard when you read him,\nas originally intended, in\nan environment without\nother distractions, such as\nto pass the time on Sunday\nafternoons. The reviewer\nabove likes to read other\nthings and writes that\nPynchon is a bad writer\nfor writing differently.\nHe may indeed be a bad\nwriter, but it would not be\nbecause of the difficulties\nthis reviewer had.\nFinally, there are books\nthat weren\u2019t written for\nyou: books addressing\nissues you do not care\nabout, have overlooked or\nstruggles you do not un-derstand. In One Hundred\nYears of Solitude, Gabriel\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez grants us\ninsight into the Colombian\nculture rarely discussed\nin the UK. He opens a\ndoor for insight, but that\nrequires empathy from a\nreader too. Books dealing\nwith issues of oppression,\nlike institutional racism,\nare often written for those\nwithin the community.\nThose of us outside the situation who attempt to read\nthem should be aware that\nthese works are not always\nwritten for us. These can\nbe the most difficult books\nto read. A book is not bad\nfor challenging your base\nbeliefs, nor for asking\nyou to empathize with\ncharacters different to\nyourself. When read con-siderately, these books can\nbe far more enlightening\nand memorable than any\n\u2018easy\u2019 novel.\nThe relationship\nbetween book and reader\nis deeply personal and\ndifficult to deconstruct.\nOur fault, as readers, is\nin expecting books to\nconform to what we want\nthem to be before opening\nthem, instead of allowing\nthem to suggest different\napproaches. The perfect\nrelationship is that of\ncompromise, where you\nallow a book to change\nyour perspective and\ngrow from it. Sometimes,\nhowever, as with relationships between people,\ncompromise is difficult. It\nis important to remember\nthat often compatibility\nisn\u2019t possible even when\nthe other has few objective\nfaults. Sometimes, the\ntiming is just wrong.\nIn defence of \u2018difficult\u2019 books\nIs a book \u2018bad\u2019 because it is \u2018too difficult\u2019 to read? Felix writer Ned Summers thinks the issue is in our approach.\nEven The Muppets can take on Dickens \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t you? // L. B. Lippincott Co.;Penguin Books;Disney\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nFRIDAY, 3RD\nNOVEMBER, 2017 FELIX\n18\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImmerse yourself in the tumultuous sea of this 20th\ncentury historical drama\nBooks writer Pavan Inguva explains why Yukio Mishima\u2019s Sea of Fertility tetralogy is an exciting blend of history,\npersonal experience and philosophy.\nBOOKS\nPavan Inguva\nBooks Writer\nA\nlot of great literature has served\nas excellent\nsnapshots into\nthe culture and attitudes\nof the society that the\nauthor describes. Yukio\nMishima\u2019s Sea of Fertility\nTetralogy is a perfect\nexample of that. The tetralogy consists of Spring\nSnow, Runaway Horses,\nThe Temple of Dawn, and\nThe Decay of the Angel,\nin that order, and while I\nhave sadly only read two\nof the four thus far, that\nwas enough to leave a profound impression on me.\nMishima constructs\na narrative centred\naround the characters\nof Shigekuni Honda, an\naspiring law student who\nbecomes a respected\nlawyer then judge, and\nKiyoaki Matsugae, who\nappears in the first book\nas a fellow student born\nto an aristocratic family,\nbut is reincarnated as\nvarious other characters\nin subsequent books. In\nconstructing the story,\nwhat I found remarkable is how Mishima\nweaves both strands of\nhis own personal life\nand the flavour of Japan\nthroughout the 20th\ncentury into a sublime\nread. Mishima\u2019s prolific\noutput of great works\nand standing have led\nto him being nominated\nfor the Nobel Prize in\nLiterature twice and\nthe Mishima award was\nnamed in his honour.\nSpring Snow was set\nin 1912 \u2013 the beginning\nof the Taisho period,\nwhich followed on from\nthe Meiji era, a time of\nsignificant change to the\nfabric of Japanese society\nthrough modernisation\nand the increasing influence of Western thought.\nThe details and broader\nanalysis of the Meiji\nera are well explored\nand documented in\nvarious works, but any\nmeaningful discussion\nof it would be beyond\nthis review. However,\nI encourage interested\nreaders to review 20th\ncentury Japanese history\nfor their own pleasure\nand perhaps an enhanced\nappreciation of the\nseries.\nMishima developed\nan ensemble of characters in the entire series\nbesides Kiyoaki and\nHonda, and these characters and their own attitudes and actions shed\nlight on the spectrum of\nopinions held towards\nthe zeitgeist of the series\u2019\nsetting (1912-1975). For\ninstance, we can see\nhow Kiyoaki\u2019s father,\nMarquis Matsugae,\ninitially a preeminent\nnobleman in Spring\nSnow, goes on to occupy\na much humbler status\nin Runaway Horses and\nsubsequently even loses\nhis estate, demonstrating\nthe changing fortunes\nof different characters\nand reflecting the state\nof flux of 20th century\nJapan.\nMishima\u2019s own life is\nalso quite fascinating,\nto say the least, and\nthis translates into his\nwriting. He was born\ninto an upper mid-dle-class family and\nhad a strong footing in\nthe samurai ethos. The\nsetting for first book was\nin his own alma mater,\nthe Peers School, and\nKiyoaki\u2019s proclivities\nto \u2018beauty\u2019 in existing\nare clear references to\nhis own life. Mishima\u2019s\nromantic life was not\nso straightforward,\nhaving been temporarily\ninvolved with the current\nempress of Japan and\nalso being reported as\nbisexual. His sexuality\nwas explored in his other\nwork, Confessions of a\nMask, though his wife\nconsistently denied this\ncharge. Within the Sea\nof Fertility tetralogy,\nelements of his own\nromantic experiences\nare quite evidently used\nin developing the plot of\nthe first book where Kiyoaki\u2019s romantic interest\nwas betrothed to a prince\nin the royal family which\nthen catalysed his own\npassion. As is with such\nfiery passions, it eventually consumed him,\nresulting in his death.\nMishima\u2019s own\nthoughts and ideologies\nmore significantly shape\nthe narrative of the\nsecond book. Mishima\nheld strongly nationalistic views and firmly\nbelieved in the divinity\nof the Emperor of\nJapan. He also felt that\nmodern developments of\nindustry had pernicious\neffects on Japan.\nAfter submitting\nthe final chapters of\nthe entire series to his\npublishers, Mishima\nproceeded to attempt a\ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat to inspire\nrestoration of power\nto the Emperor on the\nsame day. Ostensibly the\ncoup failed and Mishima\nproceeded to commit\nritual suicide after\ngiving a speech to troops\nin a Japanese military\nbase that his militant\ngroup had occupied. In\nRunaway Horses, Kiyoaki\u2019s reincarnate, Isao\nIinuma, also develops a\nsimilarly strong nationalistic fervour and plots\nto launch a campaign to\n\u2018purify Japan\u2019, failing\nwhich Isao also commits\nsuicide in a dramatic\nfashion. Runaway\nHorses was published\nin 1969, more than a\nyear before Mishima\u2019s\nown suicide, giving the\nimpression that Mishima\nhad foreshadowed his\nown death.\nThe series also\ncontains a strong philosophical bent, with\nMishima exploring\nhuman nature through\nthe characters and how\nthey react to the events\nunfolding. Honda for\nexample was initially\ncharacterised as a highly\nlogical person, which\nmanifested itself in his\nchoice to pursue law.\nHowever, when confronted with Kiyoaki\u2019s\nreincarnation, his person\nwas profoundly altered\nand his thought process\nwas well documented\nthroughout. Aspects of\nZen Buddhism and the\nphilosophy of reincar-nation, among other\ncomplex ideas, are\nexplored, particularly\nin the third book \u2013 I\nam very excited to get\nstarted on that.\nAdmittedly, I am\nunable to do justice to\nthe intellectual force of\nthe series in this short\nreview but I hope Mishima\u2019s own words will\nspeak for themselves:\n\u201cIf we look on idly,\nheaven and earth will\nnever be joined. To\njoin heaven and earth,\nsome decisive deed of\npurity is necessary. To\naccomplish so resolute\nan action, you have to\nstake your life, giving\nno thought to personal\ngain or loss. You have\nto turn into a dragon\nand stir up a whirlwind,\ntear the dark, brooding\nclouds asunder and soar\nup into the azure-blue\nsky.\u201d \u2013Runaway Horses\nMishima speaking at the University of Tokyo // KYODO\n\n"

The result of this poorly-worded document, which did not help\nPalestinians, nor those fleeing anti-Semitism? A century of conflict and misery.\nPOLITICS\nAida Manzano\nKharman\nPolitics Writer\nW\nhen people\nhear about\nP a l e s t i n e\nand Israel,\nthey usually know \u2018something\u2019s going on there\u2019 but\nfew seem to understand\nwhat exactly is happening,\nand most importantly how\nthe conflict originated.\nThere are many factors,\nbut it is widely agreed\nthat the Palestinian-Israeli\nconflict can be traced back\nto the Balfour Declaration,\nwhich was signed 100\nyears ago this week. And\nso, with a century passing\nsince the beginning of a\nlong and tragically painful\nconflict, it might be about\ntime to actually take a\nstep back and understand\nthe repercussions of this\nthree-paragraph long document and what it meant\nfor world history and\nsettler colonialism.\n\u2018So what exactly is the\nBalfour declaration?\u2019 you\nmay be asking yourself.\nWell, it is quite literally\na page-long document\nsigned by the British\nForeign Secretary at the\ntime, Sir Arthur Balfour,\nin which he states that his\ngovernment \u201cexpresses\nsympathy with Jewish\nZionist aspirations\u201d and\n\u201cview with favour the\nestablishment in Palestine\nof a national home for the\nJewish people\u201d, essentially signing off the land of\nPalestine to Jewish people\nfleeing anti-Semitism and\npersecution in Europe,\ndespite Britain not owning\nthis land in the first place.\nThis was vital to the\nZionist cause, which aims\nto establish a safe, Jewish\nhomeland. And although\nit is true that Zionism is a\nmethod through which the\nJewish people may escape\nanti-Semitism, it does not\ntake into account the fact\nthat their homeland of\nchoice was already inhabited by the Palestinians,\nand thus would require\nextensive ethnic cleansing\nwere it to become a solely\nJewish state.\nHowever, even when\nthey were giving away a\nland that was not theirs to\ngive in the first place, the\nBritish government was\nstill vague and inconclusive even in doing that:\nthey also stated \u201cnothing\nshall be done which may\nprejudice the civil and\nreligious rights of existing\nnon-Jewish communities\nin Palestine\u201d. By taking\nthis document, and thus\nestablishes precedent for\nboth involved parties to\nargue that they are the\nones that the imperialistic\npower is supporting.\nDespite the lack of\nawareness with which this\nsituation was handled, this\ndeclaration was not merely\na careless mistake made\nby the British government.\nSupporting the Zionist\ncause and allowing the\noccupation of Palestine\n(and hence the development of an apartheid state\nin the Middle East that\neconomically and politically depended on Britain)\nallowed them to maintain\ncontrol the area, without\nbeing called an imperialistic state \u2013 officially, they\nwere no longer colonising\nPalestine themselves. It\nwas the perfect method,\nnot only for Britain but\nfor Europe too, to avoid\nmaking any effort to fight\nthe ongoing anti-Semitism\nthat dated back to the\n1400s and beyond \u2013 from\nthe Spanish inquisition\nand persecution of\nSephardic Jews, going\nthrough the infamous\nRussian pogroms, and\nfinally reaching breaking\npoint after the Holocaust.\nJewish people have\nbeen through years of\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s time\nfor a big pull-quote. We love\nthese things,\nbut don\u2019t\nforget to make\nthem short!\u201d\nunjust persecution, and\nit is because of this that\nthe Zionist ideology\nblossomed. However,\nthis persecution does not\njustify the Israeli government\u2019s occupation of\nPalestine, and the resulting ethnic cleansing and\nhuman rights violations\nthat have been reported\nby the United Nations, as\nwell as by Humans Right\nWatch. We let down both\nPalestinians and Jewish\npeople fleeing persecution\nby failing to address the\nissue of anti-Semitism,\nand by partitioning Palestine in such an unaware\nmanner. A century later,\nwe have failed to carry\n\u201cWith a century\nof conflict, it\u2019s\ntime to take a\nstep back, and\nunderstand the\nrepercussions\nof this\ndocument\u201d\na look at the population\ndistribution in Palestine,\nwe can see that, even up\nuntil 1945, the Jewish\npopulation was clearly\na minority, so the real\nquestion is: how did\nBritain intend to support\nthose who wished for the\nethnic cleansing of indigenous Palestinians, whilst\nalso ensuring the Palestinians\u2019 civil and human\nrights were not com-promised, and that they\nwere protected? Britain\nmanaged to support two\nconflicting and mutually\nexclusive movements in\n\u201cWe let\ndown both\nPalestinians\nand the Jewish\npeople fleeing\npersecution\nby failing to\naddress anti-Semitism, and\nby partitioning\nPalestine in\nsuch a manner\u201d\nout any sort of meaningful\nreflection on the situation,\nBalfour\u2019s signature set off a chain of events, which are still causing anger today // Wikimedia\n\u201c100 years on,\nwe have failed\nto carry out\na meaningful\nreflection\u201d\nand the conflict remains in\na painful status quo.

She has worked\nwith a number of notable\nfilmmakers, including\nBesson, Michael Mann,\nWong Kar Wai, George\nLucas, Terrence Malick,\nDarren Aronofsky, Pablo\nLarrain, Wes Anderson,\nWoody Allen, Tim Burton,\nAnthony Minghella,\n8.

Anyone who has\nseen the best of Cheung,\na woman renowned for\nher elegant portrayals\nof fierce women in simmering dramas, would be\nsomewhat surprised that\nat the beginning of her\ncareer she was typecast\nin comedic roles as weak\nand clumsy women. That\nall changed when she was\ncast in Wong\u2019s As Tears\nGo By, a moment Cheung\nherself cites as the true\nbeginning of her serious\nacting career. This would\nbe the start of a fruitful\ncollaboration, with the\n7. Naomi Watts\nBest Performances:\nMulholland Dr., 21\nGrams, Eastern Promises, Funny Games,\nThe Ring\nEnglish Watts struggled\nto gain any traction in the\nentertainment industry\nuntil her thirties. Her early\ncareer consisted mainly\nof Australian television\nspots, including a recurring stint on Home and\nAway, and a number of\nnear misses, including auditioning five times for the\nfemale lead in Meet the\nParents before being told\nshe was \u2018not sexy enough\u2019\n(ugh). Then, at the turn of\nthe century, the legendary\nDavid Lynch picked up\nWatts\u2019 headshot, and in a\nturn of events that eerily\nresembles a famous scene\nin his surrealist neo-noir\npsychological thriller\nmasterpiece, cast Watts\nas the lead in Mulholland\nDr. Watts is astonishing\nin what is an incredible\nfilm, and this dichotomous\n6. Amy Adams\nBest Performances:\nThe Master, Junebug,\nDoubt, American Hustle, The Fighter, Arrival\nBorn in Italy, American\nAmy Adams\u2019 entire\nfilmography is from the\n21st century, with her\nfirst major role coming\nin Spielberg\u2019s Catch Me\nIf You Can. However, she\nbecame unemployed a\nyear later, and her breakthrough role didn\u2019t arrive\nuntil 2005\u2019s Junebug, for\nwhich she garnered his\nfirst Oscar nomination.\nSince then, these nods\nhave been a regular\noccurrence, and yet for\nsome reason the Academy\nseems to hate the extremely likeable Adams. Five\nnominations and no wins.\nAnd she wasn\u2019t even nom-9. Tilda Swinton\nBest Performances:\nWe Need to Talk About\nKevin, Michael Clayton, Orlando, Burn After Reading, Only Lovers Left Alive\nThough Brit actress\nSwinton\u2019s career spans\nback to the mid 80s, she\nhas only really began to be\nnoticed in the 21st\ncentury\nwhen she began taking\nsupporting roles in more\nmainstream films. Even\nthen, she only truly came\ninto the public eye with\nher Oscar-winning supporting role as a ruthless\nlawyer on the verge of\na mental breakdown in\nMichael Clayton. Make no\nmistake though \u2013 Swinton\nis far more than a supporting character actress,\nwell capable of seizing\nthe reigns as a lead, best\ndemonstrated in Lynne\nRamsay\u2019s We Need to\nTalk About Kevin and Jim\nJarmusch\u2019s Only Lovers\nLeft Alive. A rock star, an\nunfulfilled wife searching\nfor more, a vampire reconciling with her partner,\na mother battling to love\nher strange child \u2013 Swinton\u2019s filmography is one\nof the most diverse in\nthe industry. Also an ac-two teaming up on Days of\nBeing Wild, Ashes of Time,\nIn the Mood for Love, and\n2046. Though she has\nworked very infrequently\nthis century, she makes\nthis list on the strength of\nthe few projects she does\ntake. Cheung acts with\ngrace and fire in equal\nmeasures, and it is always\nspellbinding to watch her\nbalance these elements in\neach one of her delicate\nperformances.\nperformance alone is\ngood enough to warrant\na place on this list. Since\nthen she has been best\nin her Oscar-nominated\nturns in 21 Grams and\nThe Impossible, as well\nas under the wing of great\ndirectors David Cronenberg and Michael Haneke\nin Eastern Promises and\nFunny Games respective-ly. Yet it is her character\nin Mulholland Dr. that\nwill stick long in the\nmemory, demonstrating\na truly remarkable range,\nand making one think that\nWatts could convince in\nany role.\ninated for a terrific performance in Arrival last year\nwhile Meryl Streep was\nonce again invited to the\nDolby Theatre for singing\nbadly in Florence Foster\nJenkins, a film where she\nwas heavily outshone by\nHugh Grant. To be fair,\nshe has always been up\nagainst solid opposition,\nlosing to the likes of Cate\nBlanchett, Penelope Cruz,\nRachel Weisz, and Melissa\nLeo. That being said, she\nshould surely have won\nfor her tremendously\ncontrolled performance in\nThe Master ahead of Anne\nHathaway in Les Miserables. Though Adams has\ndabbled in blockbuster\nfayre in her role as Lois\nLane in the Superman\nfilms, she has largely stuck\nto working with artistic\nauteurs, such as Paul\nThomas Anderson, David\nO. Russell, Spike Jonze,\nMike Nichols, Denis Villeneuve, and Tom Ford. So\nlong as she continues this\ncareer path, surely she will\none day get up on stage\nto collect a golden statue.\nHer next opportunity will\ncome in Adam McKay\u2019s\n2018 Dick Cheney biopic\nBackseat, starring Christian Bale.\nWe will be concluding\nour countdown of the\ngreatest actresses working\ntoday in next week\u2019s issue\nof Felix\n\u201cTilda\nSwinton is far\nmore than a\nsupporting\ncharacter\nactress\u201d\nMike Nichols and Milo\u0161\nForman. Her ability to mix\npowerful performances\nin the work of critical\ndarlings with lighter roles\nin commercial blockbust-ers, including the Star\nWars prequel trilogy and\nthe first two Thor films,\nhas made Portman a\nhousehold name and recognisable face. She is best\nknown for her Academy\nAward-winning turn in\nBlack Swan, but was\nequally as mesmerising in\nlast year\u2019s Jackie.\ncomplished performance\nartist, Tilda Swinton is\na remarkable talent who\nwill likely never gain the\nacclaim she deserves,\nbut so long as she keeps\nmaking bold choices and\ndelivering smolderingly\nintense performances,\nwe\u2019ll keep tuning in to her\nrecognisable face.\nWonder Women: who rules the silver screen?\nInspired by the discussion on who will succeed Sir Daniel Day-Lewis as the best actor in the world, we look at the\ngreatest actresses on the planet. Our first part is this week \u2013 tune in next week to see who made it to number one!\nFrom ravishing romance to unsettling intensity // Universal; BBC Films; Universal; Fox Searchlight; The Weinstein Company\nFILM\nAshley Luckyram\nFilm Editor\nF\nollowing the release of the trailer\nfor Sir Daniel\nDay-Lewis\u2019 final\nfilm, Phantom Thread, last\nweek, I looked at who may\nattempt to fill his enormous boots as the finest\nactor in the world. There\nwere a number of excellent candidates, and in the\nend Day-Lewis\u2019 fellow\nPaul Thomas Anderson\ncollaborator Joaquin\nPhoenix came out on top.\nWhile thankfully there is\nno such retirement from\nour female thespians to\nspark a similar discussion,\nI have decided to pose the\nquestion nonetheless. We\nare in a golden age for\nactresses, with the number\nof elite female screen stars\nat the very least matching,\nand quite probably outnumbering the quantity of\ntheir male counterparts.\nIt has been posited\nby some that awards\nfor acting should not be\ndivided by gender, in the\nsame way that they are not\nfor directing or writing, or\nany other category for that\nmatter. The only reason\nthe divide stills exists is\nlead performance in years\ngone by. Take last year\n\u2013 the two best lead performances by some distance\nwere Isabelle Huppert in\nElle and Casey Affleck in\nManchester by the Sea (if\nin this hypothetical situation there were still only\nfive nominees then the rest\nof the field may well be\nmade up by actresses considering the accomplishments of Natalie Portman\nin Jackie, Annette Bening\nin 20th Century Women,\nSonia Braga in Aquarius\nand Sandra Huller in Toni\nErdmann, though Adam\nDriver was a delight in\nPaterson). An intriguing\nbattle, and as devastatingly\ngood Affleck is at communicating emotional turmoil\nin his stooped posture and\nmumbled speech, Huppert\u2019s performance was a\ntour de force that surely\nwould have come out on\ntop (although considering\nshe lost the actual real-life\nAcademy Award to Emma\nStone for La La Land,\nshe would probably be\nunjustly beaten again \u2013\nyou can\u2019t escape fuck-ups\nby the Academy even in\nthe hypothetical realm).\nIt is difficult to determine whether this\nprominence is down to\na particular purple patch\nfor women acting in film,\nin the sense that many\nhave emerged together\nby chance, or whether\nthere have always been\nvast quantities of great\nactresses, and that in the\npast we were only able to\nsee a few due to limited\nopportunities in a historically sexist industry. It\ncould be argued that were\nthere more substantial\nroles written for women\nover the past fifty years,\nwe could have seen twenty\nHepburns instead of just\ntwo. Or more contemporaries to the likes of Taylor,\nBergman and Leigh. Our\npig-headed discrimination\nby gender has robbed us of\ngreat art. That is not to say\nthat enough female characters are being scripted\nin the present day. Far too\nmany times we see these\nincredible talents have to\nplay second fiddle to their\nmale colleagues, often\nsubmissively portraying\nthe object of love and lust,\nrather than a fully fleshed\nout human being with\ntheir own ideas, thoughts\nformers, the industry will\nsoon be left with no choice\nbut to bow down and give\nthem the significant roles\nthey deserve, and have\ndeserved for a very long\ntime.\n(Note: This is a list of\nthe best actresses working\ntoday. It was incredibly\ndifficult to whittle it down\nto just ten, and the difference between some on this\nlist is negligible. That is a\ntestament to the astounding talent of the women\non screen that we have the\npleasure of watching work.\nHonourable mentions:\nJessica Chastain, Viola\nDavis, Kate Winslet,\nSaoirse Ronan, Michelle\nWilliams, Rooney Mara,\nKristen Stewart, Juliette\nBinoche, Penelope Cruz,\nMeryl Streep, Charlize\nTheron, Judi Dench,\nScarlett Johansson, Laura\nLinney, Laura Dern, Greta\nGerwig, Rachel Weisz,\nJacki Weaver, Charlotte\nGainsbourg, Kirsten\nDunst, Elle Fanning, and\nAnnette Bening)\n\u201cWe are in a\ngolden age for\nactresses, with\nthe number\nof elite female\nstars quite\nprobably\noutnumbering\ntheir male\ncounterparts \u201d\ntradition. It is interesting to\nconsider what would have\nhappened were there just\none Academy Award for\n\u201cFar too many\ntimes, these\nincredible\ntalents play\nsecond fiddle \u201d\nand feelings; their own\nstory. I think this time of\ngreat actresses has arisen\ndue to a combination of\ngood fortune providing\nus with more talented\nartists than ever before,\nand meatier parts finally\nbeginning to appear,\nallowing a platform for\nthem to showcase their\nabilities.

Smith\nTV Writer\nCreator: Joe Penhall.\nStarring: Jonathan Groff;\nHolt McCallany; Hannah\nGross; Anna Torv.\nMINDHUNTER\nSEASON 1\nM\nindhunter is\na gritty 10\npart Netflix\ncrime drama\nset in 1977, based on\nJohn E. Douglas and\nMark Olshaker\u2019s book of\nthe same name. Listing\nCharlize Theron and\nDavid Fincher among\nits producers, the show\ntakes tips from both stars\u2019\nprevious work, most\nnotably the camera work\nand atmosphere, which\nwere perfect in Fincher\u2019s\nZodiac. Jonathan Groff\nplays Holden Ford, an FBI\nagent who is motivated to\nunderstand why it is that\ncriminals act the way they\ndo, and the motivations of\nserial killers in particular.\nThis leads to Ford joining\nup with the behavioural\nsciences solo unit at the\nFBI, run by Bill Tench\n(Holt McCallany). Agents\nFord and Tench want\nto expand the unit from\nbeing just \u201cprofiling road\nschool\u201d to a scientific inquiry of what causes these\nrandom killings. There is\nconstant internal scrutiny\nfrom the FBI about the\nworth of this unit from\ntheir boss, Shepard (Cotter\nSmith).The series then follows these characters try\nto learn why \u2018spree killers\u2019\nexist, and to understand\nthe psychology of their actions by interviewing them\nin prison. Subsequently,\nthe team expands, with the\nunit hiring Wendy (Anna\nTorv), a Boston University\nsocial sciences professor,\nand further characters appearing later in the series.\nThere is an over-arching\nplot at the beginning of\nevery episode showing\nan unknown serial\nkiller (well, unknown to\nto do well is the intense,\nintimate interview scenes\nwith the serial killers the\nagents are studying. Most\nnotably, the recurring\ncharacter and real-life\nkiller, Edmund Kemper,\nportrayed brilliantly\nby Cameron Britton.\nBritton\u2019s portrayal of the\nsociopathic killer is well\nexecuted and probably the\nstand out performance of\nthe series, with the effects\nof his visceral explanations of his crimes causing\npsychological damage to\nthe agents investigating\nhim throughout the series.\nThis is not to mention the\nstriking resemblance that\nBritton holds to the man,\nproving that casting is a\ncrucial element of a good\nbiopic.\nTench is a highly mas-culinised agent, visiting\nlocal police departments\nto teach them techniques,\nbut mainly socialising\nand having a laid-back\napproach to the job.\nHowever, we see that\nthese interviews detailing\nthe heinous crimes have a\nlarge psychological toll on\nhis character, leading his\nfamily life to be strained,\nand even causing him\nto take a break from the\ninterviews. The idea that\nthis seemingly granite\nplot device allowing us to\nsee how Groff\u2019s character\nchanges from an upstanding member of the agency\nto somebody who has\ngotten in too deep with the\npsyche of the serial killer.\nHowever, this is clunkily\nimplemented into the\nshow and it sometimes felt\nthat these scenes were just\njammed in as time fillers.\nThis is perhaps because\nthe viewer just sees her as\nFord\u2019s student girlfriend\nrather than a complex\ncharacter of her own.\nThe show approaches\nits setting and time period\nquite well, giving an authentic feel of a time when\nthere was much hostility\ntowards the FBI in the\nUSA. It also shows how\nthe agency wanted to shed\nits image of \u2018Hoover\u2019s\nboys\u2019 to a world leading\nhighly successful special\npolice force. It deals with\nthe stigma of homosexuality within government\nagencies at the time\nthrough Wendy\u2019s character as she is led to live a\ndouble life at home and at\nwork.

The National Portrait Gallery\nWhen? Until 11th\nFebruary\n2018\nHow Much? \u00a318; \u00a316.50\nstudents\nC\u00c9ZANNE PORTRAITS\nT\no be honest,\nI\u2019ve never really\nunderstood the\ngreatness of\nC\u00e9zanne. Another big\nmale artist, but with an\nImpressionist style not as\nfairy-like as Monet and a\ntechnique not as cubistic\nas Picasso. An in between\n\u2013 someone who never\nreally dedicated himself to\nany specific style.\nWithout any expectations to have my mind\nchanged I enter the\nNational Portrait Gallery\nand the first thing I can\u2019t\nhelp but notice is the\ngrandness of the museum.\nI find my way to the\nexhibition and walk in.\nCrisp white walls, high\narches, and staff walking\naround in black uniforms,\nmaking sure that no one\ntakes a photograph nor\ntouches the art. The halls\nare not only filled with art,\nthey are also filled with\npeople. People of all ages,\nof different styles and na-tionalities. It did not take\nlong for me to realize that\nit\u2019s not just any exhibition\nI\u2019m entering \u2013 rather, it\u2019s\nan exhibition of one of the\nbiggest artists of the 19th\ncentury.\nWe walk through\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s life and artistic\ndevelopment. We meet\nmore and less important\npeople in his life through\nhis portraits, people who\nhave been there for longer\nand for shorter periods of\ntime. Most importantly,\nwe meet an ever changing\nC\u00e9zanne \u2013 from rough\nportraits in earthy colors\nto paintings full of play-fulness. The exhibition\nstarts off with some of his\nearlier works, paintings\nthat are characterized by\nfast strokes made with a\npalette knife. The technique that he developed\nduring this phase of his life\nis often referred to as one\nof the major contributing\nfactors to the Expressionist\nmovement, characterized\nby magnified emotional\nexpressions, often communicated through colors\nand shapes. At first glance\nthe paintings feel pretty\nbrown and colorless, but\nas you step closer to the\nframe a palette full of color\nstarts to reveal itself. Blue,\ngreen, and yellow, all\nperfectly clear and distinct\nat a near distance but\nfrom afar creating a unity.\nThere is something wild in\nthis way of painting; the\nmovements of the knife\nare easily distinguished\nand create a storm of dull\ncolors.\nThe color palette intensifies as we continue\nour tour to the next\nroom. Portraits in bright\nturquoise, pink, and red\nshow a distinct change in\nflamboyant. The palette\nknife phase is over, but\nthe geometrical shapes\nthat he used to create with\nthem live on as blocks of\ncolor. The playfulness and\nbeauty in this part of the\nexhibition can easily be\nappreciated, even by those\ndragged here by their\ngrandmothers.\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s later years\nwere filled with hardships,\nas reflected in the last\nroom, where portraits in\ndark colors and self-por-traits of an elderly, gloomy\nversion of his old self\nall contribute to a more\nobscure atmosphere.\nC\u00e9zanne did not want\nto flatter people in his\nportraits, and he refused\nto paint anyone who\nexpected an improved\nversion of themselves. The\npeople in his portraits are\nnot exceptionally beautiful\nor interesting to look at.\nBeneath the technique and\ncolours they are normal\npeople portrayed as their\ntrue selves. The wish to\ncreate a realistic interpretation of his models\nbecomes clear in the portraits of Hortense Fiquet,\nmore commonly known as\nMadame C\u00e9zanne. Several\ncanvases are dedicated\nto her quite grumpy face.\nShe is not being painted\nas a muse, not idolized or\nembellished. We can see\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s objectivity in\nthese portraits as they lack\nany tendency of facial\nexpressions or emotions.\nThis objectivity follows\nthrough in all of his work:\nunlike his colors and\ntechnique the faces remain\nplain. C\u00e9zanne is known\nfor his still life paintings,\nand the way he has chosen\nto portray his models is\nmore like how you would\nportray a bowl of fruit\nrather than a human being.\nInstead of focusing on the\nface, the emphasis is on\nthe details around: a pipe,\nhat, or a not-fully-painted\nskirt are all details that\nattract the eye \u2013 the details\nthat make the audience\nsearch and look around for\nmore.\nI have always believed\nthat C\u00e9zanne\u2019s work is\njust plain and boring. This\nhas been proved wrong.\nAfter visiting the National\nPortrait Gallery I have\ncome to realize that he is\nmuch more than an in-be-tween: he paved the way\nfor the Cubist movement\nwith his graphic and\ngeometrical technique,\ninspired Expressionism\nwith his palette knife\nphase, and is still considered an Impressionist. But\nthere is also a curiosity, a\nplayfulness, and a desire\nto keep trying new things\nin all of his paintings. It is\nthe small details, the half\npainted skirt, the pipe,\nand the hat, that reveal the\ncurious artist in search of\nexpression.\n\u201cIn the\nexhibition,\nwe meet an\never-changing\nC\u00e9zanne \u2013\nfrom rough\nearly portraits\nto playful\npaintings\u201d\n\u201cBeneath the\ntechnique\nand colours,\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s\nportraits reveal\npeople as their\ntrue selves\u201d\nstyle. The intense colors\nare weighed down by\nmore gentle brush strokes\nthan seen before. It creates\na more impressionistic\nfeeling which is not only\nby chance: during this\nperiod of his life C\u00e9zanne\nencountered several soon-to-be famous Impressionist painters such as\nPissarro and Monet. Their\ninfluence on C\u00e9zanne\u2019s\nwork is clear, with the\nbrush strokes and colors\ngoing from earthy and\nharsh to light, graphic, and\nMadame C\u00e9zanne in a Yellow Chair, 1888-90 by Paul C\u00e9zanne // Wilson L.

    "content": "ISSUE 1674\nFELIX\n9\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe darker side of human data\nWhat are the implications of a near future in which humans will be rated on their behaviour and relationships?\nSCIENCE\nHenry Alman\nScience Writer\nI\nn 2014, the State\nCouncil of China\nannounced the development of a digital\n\u2018citizen rating system\u2019 to\ndetermine each citizen,\ncompany, and local\ngovernment\u2019s \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d, with the intent of\nbuilding social trust and\ncrushing China\u2019s rampant\ncounterfeiting and fraud\nissues.\nTo Westerners it may\nsound like an Orwellian\ndystopia. For the Chinese,\nhowever, it is soon to be a\nreality, and participation\nwill be compulsory by\n2020. The idea is already\nbeing implemented by\neight private Chinese\ncompanies, one of whom\nis the financial wing of\nAlibaba, China\u2019s largest\nonline shopping platform.\nAlthough the form of\nthe government system\nis uncertain, cues can\nbe taken from Alibaba\u2019s\nsystem, Sesame Credit\n(SC). Users are given\na score based on five\nfactors: credit history, fulfilment capacity, personal\ninformation, behaviour\nand preferences, and interpersonal relationships.\nThe first three may sound\nfamiliar: they are similar\nto a credit score, and are\nbased on financial information and basic personal\ndetails.\nThe last two are factors\ncurrently unaccounted\nfor in western big data\nsystems. They indicate\nthat what you \u2013 or your\nfriends \u2013 buy online or say\non social media can and\nwill affect your \u201ctrustworthiness rating\u201d.\nSC scores do not take\ncontent into account:\nusing Alibaba\u2019s services,\nor having friends who\nuse SC, will increase\nyour score, but what is\nactually bought or said has\nno effect. It resembles a\nloyalty scheme more than\na social credit system.\nThe implication, however,\nis that it could consider\nthese factors, and that the\ngovernmental system will.\nData is drawn from\na variety of sources:\nChina\u2019s corporate giants\nare worlds apart from their\nwestern counterparts. SC\nalone draws information\nfrom all of Alibaba\u2019s\nbranches, from shopping\nto taxi services to Alipay,\nChina\u2019s ubiquitous online\npayment platform. Alipay\nis used for everything\nfrom bills to bus tickets,\nand so Sesame Credit\nalways knows where you\nare and what you buy. Big\ndata is simply a fact of\nChinese life.\nThe government has\naccess to all of this infor-mation, atop of that from\n\u201cYour personal\nscore will\nhave tangible\nconsequences\nin reality\u201d\n\u201cThe\ntechnological\nlimitations of\nsuch a system\nare important\u201d\nother mega-corporations,\ndue to the Chinese government\u2019s long-standing\nhistory of demanding\nusers\u2019 personal data from\nprivate companies.\nYour personal score will\nhave tangible consequences in reality. Those with\nhigh SC scores can book\nhotels without a deposit,\nor even get fast-tracked\nfor visas. The future\ngovernment system would\neven incorporate punish-ment: a 2016 document\nsays that low scores could\nresult in ineligibility for\ncertain jobs, lower internet\nspeeds, and barring from\ncertain restaurants.\nChina already severely\npunishes dissenters: 6.3\nmillion people who defied\ncourt orders are on a public\nblacklist, banning them\nfrom buying plane or train\ntickets and limiting the\npurchase of luxury goods.\nInternet access or social\nmedia accounts are often\nsuspended for expressing\ndissent.\nAmplified by their\nbig-data rating system,\nthe potential for absolute\ntotalitarian control is real.\nTechnological tampering\nis also a threat: if the\nsecurity of the system is\never breached, the damage\ncaused by hackers could\nruin lives.\nDespite this, the system\nis being welcomed by\nmany Chinese citizens.\nChinalacksthewidespread\ncredit score systems that\nare well-established else-where, making it difficult\nto obtain loans. Fraud and\ncounterfeiting are daily\ngrievances. The Chinese\nare sick of the absence of\nreliability in their society.\nFurthermore, there are\nthose that argue that the\nnew system offers more\ngovernmental transparen-cy. China rewards loyal\ncitizens, too: hundreds of\nthousands of honours and\ntitles are given every year,\nalong with other benefits.\nHowever, the criteria\nfor these are arbitrarily\ndecided by officials: at\non friends or family, and\nthe fact that any dissenter\nwill drag down the scores\nof those around them encourages ditching \u2018risky\u2019\nfriendships.\nThe issue with the\nsecond is that a human can\napply context to a situa-tion, whereas an algorithm\ncannot. Under China\u2019s\nautomatic digital rating\nsystem, missing a bill\ndue to being in hospital\nand missing a bill due to\nunreliability are counted\nas exactly the same.\nThe technological limitations of such a system\nare important. Black\nmarket score manipula-tion, by buying different\npersonal details, or the use\nof VPNs for undetected\nonline activity, would\ntamper with the data. The\ndata and analysis on which\none\u2019s score is based could\nbe flawed: nobody knows\nwhether the suggested\nsystem is really feasible.\nThe fact that the\noriginally caused by the\ngovernment\u2019s intolerance\nof any external institution\nthat might enforce ac-countability.\nRather than allow for independent watchdogs and\nincreased transparency,\nthey instead opt for greater\ncontrol. As put by Foreign\nPolicy, the government\nis \u201censuring that the only\nmonitor will, once and\nforever, be itself.\u201d\nEven Charlie Brooker might call the developments in China a bit trite // Creative Commons\n\u201cAmplified by\ntheir big-data\nrating system,\nthe potential\nfor absolute\ncontrol is real\u201d\nleast a rating system\nwould rely on a suppos-edly-predictable algorithm\nwith defined criteria.\nBoth points have their\ncounterarguments. For\nthe first, the new system\nundermines trust in other\nways \u2013 there will be\nrewards for informing\nChinese government wish\nto try regardless is telling.\nThey have many options\nto consider as remedies for\nsocial mistrust, an issue\n\n"
