    "content": "NIGHTLIFE FELIX NightLife mam \u00ab'\u00abWltUM t uu*t t BROOKS\nHarlem Nights hU Je Friday @ The End While The End usually offers the only real\ncompetition to the international behemoth that\nis Fabric on a Friday night, they have recently\nintroduced something which is a slightly different kettle of geese - Harlem Nights.\nAn opportunity for the increasingly successful Steve Lawler to heavily experiment with a finger mangling six hour set of deep and funky\ntribal house, he has risen steadily and is now\noften referred to as the UK's answer to Mr.\nDanny Tenaglia.\nI had thought that departure from the usual\nFriday night format might confuse the core regulars of The End, but the main dance floor was\nthe heaving mass of flesh and perspiration that\nit always is, Lawler having clearly attracted a large fan base of his own.\nSyncopated beats flowed a little faster in the\nlounge, where Paul Arnold and friends laid\ndown some inspired breakbeat and catered for\nall. Unfortunately, this meant there wasn't really a chill out area.\nAs dawn approached I found myself fanta-s ising of mermaids, clear waters and snow.\nAnother good night at The End then.\nDan Bush\nEQ Warehouse\nhU Je is definitely aimed at a very particular\ncrowd. The music is at the manic end of\ntrance, and it's very, very hippie - stoner s, organic juice bar, massage, a crusty doing\nluminous face painting, and lots of dreads and\npiercings. If you've ever been to Undertow at\nthe same venue, it's a very similar vibe. Not\ngenerally my thing, but I had a really good\ntime, and if it's your thing, you will love it.\nThere are lots of reasons to go. A free\nminibus from the nearest station, cheaper\nentry before 11.30pm if you dress up (colour-ful/costumed/outrageous), and a very friendly\ncrowd. The three DJs I heard were all good,\nStelvio, Jari, and particularly Mad Theo who\nwill be appearing at the next event.\nThe only problem was that as it was only the\nsecond hU Je ever, there were nowhere near\nenough punters to fill the club. As the advertising is also very narrowly targeted - to attract\nexactly the crowd they want - numbers may be\nslow to build. Don't let this put you off though,\nit won't get full until people take a chance and\ngo, and I have no doubt that when they do,\nthis night will really take off.\nJosie Harral\nMovement\nThursday @ Bar Rumba\nOf the drum 'n' bass nights currently running in\nLondon, the award winning Movement is without doubt amongst the best of them.\nThis comes as no surprise considering the\nquality of the resident DJs and MCs, including\nthe Brazilian, DJ Marky, whose an the mic 'LK'\nhas been smashing it on the dance floor for\nalmost 2 years now. This night was not going\nto let the club's reputation down, with the\nBrazilian in question and his fellow resident,\nRuffstuff, behind the decks.\nBy midnight, the intimate dance floor was\nrammed with r avers thriving on the party\natmosphere down in the Rumba basement.\nMarky didn't disappoint, mixing his own material with the freshest tunes currently on rota-tion, with the occasional scratch thrown in for\ngood measure. His set went down a storm.\nRuffstuff was impressive as ever, and with\nhis quick and innovative mixing style we\nshould be expecting him to be making more\nregular appearances at the likes of Fabric and\nthe End.\nOnce again, we were reminded why\nMovement is the best d'n'b night in London.\nTim Manuel\nFriday 29th November\nSteve Lawler 6 hour set\n10pm5 am \u00a38 Conc/\u00a310 guests;\nThe End, 16a West Central Street, WC1\nwww.the-end.co.uk\nFriday 22nd November\nMad Theo plays The Gathering\n9pm6 am George IV, 144 Brixton Hill\nFor hU Je listings keep an eye on\nwww.hu je. co.uk\nThursday 28th November\nAdam F8.30p m3am \u00a33 before 10pm, \u00a36 thereafter,\nBar Rumba, 36 Shaftesbury Avenue, W l www. bar rumba. co.uk\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk Become a Felix reviewer to have your say on all the latest entertainment\n\n"

    "content": "2 0 MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX I Live Re\nMillionaire\n100 Club, Oxford Street\nSiamese make you want to join a band there and\nthen. That, or simply pogo insanely around your\nroom. With alternating female and male lead\nvocals, dressed in purposely un cool self-cut jeans,\nthey provide the simple passionate rhythms of King\nAdora and the raunchy strength of Elastica.\nThe band enjoys the short set un fathom ably more than the crowd and dance manic ally across\nthe stage. They transmit Brit-pop energies with a twist of more original concepts among their songs.\nThe love for what they do powers the excitement of\ntheir set. The band is so together, so neat; it's easy\nto imagine them spending every weekend in their\ndad's garage until they get it right. Bless.\nSpan are also a band who love what they do but\nunfortunately all they do is play over-used chord\nsequences and bash away at a defenceless drum\nkit. They have a rock bass which could make your\nslightly inebriated self scream out to your metal\nsoul but standing sober it's not all that impressive.\nSigns of hope do rise at points with promising\nguitar riffs and gentle vocals, but in all honesty, this\nis nothing new. Here are another group who think\nthat louder plus faster automatically equals better;\n3/5\nand like all who think that way, they're wrong.\nBy the time headliners Millionaire approach the\nstage, Span has managed to frighten off half the\ncrowd. It's just wrong.\nThe deliciously droning melodies, simple (and\nrightly so) drum beats and utterly delectable electronica combine to produce a work of rock funk art.\nAnd a beautiful one at that. The six Belgians on\nstage are full of power, spirit and the knowledge to\nentertain. An amalgamation of rousing voice distortions, a Cooper Temple Clause-esque drum\nmachine and vigorously dynamic bass create a near\nperfect sequence. The classic guitar and drums\ncombination develop into layers of rock mayhem\nand electronica madness.\nThe lights, the front, and the sound all work\nincredibly well together to give what remains of the\ntiny 100 Club crowd a real treat. Such a treat that\na guy notices me frantically making notes and\ncomes darting over. \"Just write 'BRILLIANT' in big\nletters!\" he screams, before running back to swing\nhis stuff to the funk metal act that is Millionaire.\nSo there you have it. BRILLIANT.\nKeira\nQueens Of The Stone Age\nThe Forum\n5/5\nImagine if you will a great big\nROCK, a really, really big ROCK,\nsomething like Gibraltar is about\nthe right size.\nNow imagine this large ROCK\nbeing stuffed full of high explosives and blown into the next\ndimension while you stand 20ft away. Got that image? Good.\nNow multiply the experience by\nabout... lets say 20. That should\nnow be pretty close to the general\nfeeling of a Queens of the Stone\nAge show.\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThey are PHENOMENAL, to put\nit in simple terms, phenomenal.\nThey play with enough power\nand force that, if channelled prop-e rly, could send a small country to\nthe moon and back via Valhalla\nand still have enough left over to\nbeat James Dean Bradfield in a race for the pies. Not that there's an ounce of extra fat in the show:\neverything is stripped down to the\nessentials (except - unusually -Nick Oliveri who remains fully\nclothed throughout), ie. lots of\nguitars, big drums, flashing lights\nand an occasionally screeched\nvocal. They sound like Thor and\nhis mates jamming with Pete\nTownshend after Led Zepellin\npopped round with some Black\nSabbath records. Yes, that heavy.\nBut heavy in a good way.\nThey manage to maintain a very\nraw rock sound without losing\nmuch of the sheen from the studio\nversion. Current single No One\nKnows keeps its tune fulness and\nmelody yet still feels like it could\nbring a venue twice the size to its\nknees and give it a good beating.\nCrowd favourite Lost Art of\nKeeping a Secret shows why it\nwill continue to be a favourite as it\nstampedes its way through the\ncollective psyche like a raging bull\nin the proverbial china shop, while\nFeel Good Hit of the Summer\ntakes on behemoth proportions as\nit is stripped down to its birthday\nsuit and given a good flogging in\nfront of a few thousand crazed\nfans. Even the cello accompanied\nMosquito Song feels enormously\nbigger than its two acoustic guitars tonight.\nEverything is held together in\nastonishing fashion by Joey\nCastillo, the replacement for Dave\nGrohl. Attacking his kit like a man\npossessed, he truly looks like he\ncould kick Dave's ass with his\nhands tied behind his back, and is\nactually the driving force behind\nthe juggernaut.\nIn fact, forget bombs, send in\nthe Queens and the sheer brutal\nforce, passion and volume should\nbring Iraq to its knees. Dom\nSummer is\nhere\nSomeone remind me what\nmonth it is. People keep trying\nto tell me that it's winter but\nI'm sure that can't be right.\nThere's just so much sunshine\neverywhere. Honestly.\nSummery happy sunny tunes\nmaking people smile and\ndance madly: that's what\neveryone should be listening to\nnow. It doesn't matter that it's raining outside. It doesn't even\nmake me sad that the days are\nlong, dark and grey. Not with\nthe sunshine that keeps playing from my stereo.\nYou may think I'm mad. The\neighth wonder of the world,\naka The Polyphonic Spree,\nhave enlightened my philosophy of our dreary winter\nnights. They dance, they smile,\nthey shine. How could 25 people in white tunics shouting,\n\"Hello to the sun!\" exist anywhere but summer?\nLemon Jelly are also spreading the joy using their latest\nbox of happy treats, Lost\nHorizons. It truly is an album\nto make you warm inside.\nGentle electronica and rolling\ninstrumentals will have you\nback in a summer meadow in\nno time.\nThen there's Athlete. Aw,\nlovely little Athlete. \"We\nshould be laughing about it,\nmaking the most of the true\nBritish climate\", the cheery\nLondoners advise. YOU MUST\nBUY THIS. It will make you\nsmile; it will make the world\nseem right. The hailstorms will\ncease, the clouds will part and\nthe sun will shine down. Trust\nme.\nDon't be fooled by what\neveryone says: now is the time\nfor summer. Thanks to the\nlikes of Simple Kid, A Million\nSons and Nightmares On Wax,\nwe need never be afraid of the\nsnowy months again.\nAs an alternative, visit\nwww.rather good. com/vines\nand laugh for hours. Genius.\nKeira\nI \"You shine with the light of a million suns.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX BOOK REVIEWS17 Welcome to the books page. This week I 've decided to put an end to my hermit ways and emerge from the shadow of my crack team of reviewers. I'm trying to prove that no, I'm not scary and so yes, please send in reviews, comments etc to me at books.felix@ic.ac.uk. Pretty please.\nThere's something for both sides of your split personalities this week. If you're feeling brave there's Touching the Void - one of those books that everyone\nraves about, even if they've never even seen a mountain. For your arm-chair side, there's a follow-on from two weeks ago when we reviewed Tony Parsons\nfirst book Man and Boy. Watch a hard man weep... Roz\nTouching the Void is the account of an\nexpedition to the Andes by two\nclimbers, Joe Simpson and Simon\nYates, and their attempts to reach the\nsummit of the Siula Grande mountain.\nTheir decision to climb the West Face\nof Siula Grande without any technical\nsupport is ambitious, and very nearly\nTouching The Void\nJoe Simpson fatal. Joe suffers a horrendous fall, and\nafter several further accidents, and a heart wrenching decision by Simon,\nhe is left for dead. Joe is the author of\nthe book so we know for sure he sur-vives, but the tale of his escape is\nmade none the less dramatic.\nThis is a stunning book. I was\ngripped from the very first page and\nthe pace meant I'd finished it within\n24 hours. That all of the events are\nreal, and that the story is being told by\nthe people involved, gives a strong\nsense of immediacy and feel of\nauthenticity. Joe Simpson also writes\nextremely well, a rare talent among\nauto biographers. The book is written\nas a real-time account of the events\nthat took place, and Joe's style brings\na range of emotions to the story. I especially liked the background he\ngives to their hitchhiker friend - a well\nexperienced and hardened traveller,\nbut a fish out of water on the freezing\nslopes of the Andes - and the chilling\nanecdotes about the horrors of past\nclimbing trips and the perils of third\nworld travel. Both serve to bring home\nthe message that the two climbers are\ntaking their lives in their hands. Death\nis a very real consideration for all three\nof them in this harsh environment.\nIn fact, my only criticism is the constant mention of impending doom - it\ndoes diminish in impact each time it is\nmentioned. Then again, when your life\nis in danger and any mistake could be\nyour last, death must be on your mind\njust a little! This is the only minor\ncomplaint about an otherwise excellent book - READ IT! {Against the\nWall is an account of Simon's side of\nthe story).\nRebecca Wood\nVintage; ISBN: 0099771012\ntony pars om one for my baby\nDo you believe in love?\nCourse you do - we all do. Ever\nbeen in love? Most of us have, I guess. Ever thought you'd never get\nover it? That's me every time. Alfie\nBudd's the same. He's just like the\nrest of us, searching for happiness\nand a meaning to existence. He was\nhappy once, happy beyond belief; his\nlife was complete and full of purpose.\nBut then it all suddenly went away,\nand there was nothing in the world\nanybody could have done to stop it.\nAnd Alfie doesn't think he'll get another chance at happiness.\nA couple of weeks back, Tony\nParson's debut, Man and Boy, got a rave review in Felix, and I have to\nagree. It was wicked; down to earth,\nbeautifully written and full of laughs.\n(The televisa tion of the book, how ev One For My Baby\nTony Parsons\ner, made me want to repeatedly hit\nmy head against something very hard\nwhilst biting on a sheet of glass) One\nfor My Baby, Parson's second\nattempt, although less well received\nby critics, is surprisingly even better\nthan the first.\nI think this novel exceeds its predecessor in many aspects. Although the\nscope of the story may not be as dramatic or theatrical as the first, it is\ndefinitely more focused and realised.\nThis novel is even funnier, more iron-ic, and more poignant than the one\nbefore, if that's possible.\nIt's about a man's personal struggle\nthrough a difficult period in his life.\nPerhaps struggle is not the right word;\nhe's trying to get away from the mun-dani ty of it all. He's stuck in a rut and\nhe doesn't know the way out. He's reached a plateau and he's looking for\nchange. Returning back to England\nafter living abroad, Alfie tries to find\nsome balance and normality, and\nattempts to renew his life. But he just\ncan't let go of what he once had, he\ndoesn't want to let go of the other life\nhe led in a place far away.\nBut hey, it's not all as gloomy as I make out. It's not like he spends the\nwhole book feeling sorry for himself\nand reeling in a gon is ed depression or\nanything. Far from it; that's not\nParson's style at all. It's funny. Damn\nfunny. Real damn funny. Funny in a way that makes you laugh out loud\nand giggle to yourself like a freak.\nBut it's also tear jerking. I cried\nmany times throughout this book. I got some weird looks when my bottom lip quivered and I blubbered on\nthe tube to and from college. It really\nis impressive how it could make a grown man cry ( but then again, I have to admit I cried when Spiderman's uncle died). But you cry not\nbecause it's depressingly sad or morbidly sombre, it's simply that it's very\ntouching. There are themes here that\neveryone can relate to, and emotions\nare painted in such a way that just a few lines of prose can bring even a kung-fu hard man like myself to tears\n- be them of sadness or joy.\nEverything is fantastically illustrated with words; from the nostalgic\ndescriptions of the quaintness and far\neastern exotic is m of Hong Kong, to\nthe urban sprawl of instantly recognisable parts of good old London\ntown.\nThe characters are beautifully\nexplored and immediately ident if i able; Alfie himself, his stranded\nMother, the midI if e crisis-thinks-he's twenty-again Father, the loving and\nfragile yet tough-as-nails\nGrandmother, the satirically toffee-nosed best pal, Alfie's string of inappropriate girlfriends, and the hilarious\nand enigmatic Chang family.\nThis book is all about love, family,\nsex, Tai Chi and the human heart.\nIt's a book that just has to be read.\nI can't express how much I enjoyed it\nand how I just couldn't restrain myself\nfrom reading it during lectures. If this\nwas in primary school, I'd give it a gold star, a smiley face badge AND a packet of wine gums. That really is\nhow good it is. Enjoy.\nWai-Wai\nHarperCollins; ISBN: 0002261820\nbooks.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX We did go to the moon - honest!\nIn 1969, Neil Armstrong took man's first step\non the moon. It was a pivotal moment in\nhuman history, except that some people still\npersist with the view that man never landed on\nthe moon. Such people claim to have convincing evidence to back up their views. In this article I'm going to look at some of this \"evidence\"\nwith a scientific eye to show once and for all\nthat we did go to the moon.\nMany of the \"moon hoax\" theories are based\naround anomalies in the photographs taken on\nthe moon and are due mostly to a lack of\nunderstanding of photography. The cameras\ntaken to the moon were not significantly different to standard professional cameras and so are\nsubject to the same problems. I will answer\nsome of the common questions asked about the\nNo stars?\nmoon photographs.\n\"Why can't you see the stars in the photographs on the moon?\"\nThis can easily be explained if we consider\nhow bright the surface of the moon is compared\nto the stars. The moon has no atmosphere and\nso its surface is much brighter than the Earth's. Any photographer will tell you how difficult it is\nto take a picture of dim and bright objects at\nthe same time - you either have to set the exposures for the bright objects or the dim objects\nand cannot do both. It is hardly surprising\ntherefore, that the Apollo astronauts chose to\nopt i mise their camera settings for the moon's surface and not for the stars.\n\"The cross hairs on this photograph appear\nto go behind the objects in the photograph.\nDoes this suggest that the photograph is a faked \"pasted together\" image?\nThe cross hairs on the photographs were also\non a glass plate between the camera lens and\nCross-hairs behind subject?\nfilm. They stop the light from reaching the film,\nresulting in cross-hairs on the photographs.\nWhen taking a picture of a bright object the film\nwill be overexposed in the bright areas and can\n\"bleed\" into other areas of the picture. So if a cross hair appears in a really bright area of one\nof the moon pictures, the bright area can bleed\nover the cross hair.\n\"This photograph shows, like many other\nApollo photographs, strange blobs in the sky.\nWhat are they?\"\nThe blobs are due to flare, which occurs\nwhen a bright light shines into the camera lens\nand reflects off its interior.\n\"The temperatures on the moon reach 280\ndegrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn't this have baked\nthe photographic film until it frizzled?\"\nThe moon has a day that lasts two Earth\nweeks and yes, the maximum temperature can\nget to 280 degrees Fahrenheit, but the film did\nnot spend two weeks sitting in the sun. It spent\nmost of its time either in the camera or in the\nlander, both of which are shielded so as to\nreflect as much heat as possible.\n\"If the sun is the only source of light on the\nmoon, why do lots of the photos, like this one,\nshow shadows at different angles and lengths?\nDoesn't this show the use of more than one\nspot light?\"\nAliens above the moon?\nStrange shadows...\nThere is actually a dip in the surface between\nthe two men and so the shadow on the right is\nsloping downhill while the shadow on the left is\nsloping uphill. Also, if there was more than one\nlight source, everything would have more than\none shadow, but no photograph shows this\nhappening.\nHopefully now you will be able to laugh,\nalong with me, at anybody who claims we did\nnot go to the moon. Let us not remove from our\nhistory one of our greatest achievements.\nRosie Chandler\nReducing childhood asthma\nResearchers from Imperial College London and\nSt. Mary's NHS Trust have discovered that\nkeeping people with coughs and sneezes away\nfrom young babies may cut the likelihood of\ndeveloping wheeze or asthma later in child-hood. Results of the researchers' study, published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine,\nshow that by simply delaying when an infant\nsuffers from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-the major cause of common cold in adults -may make the difference.\nRSV will infect most children during the first\nyear of life and can keep re-infecting, as it is\nable to get around the immune system. For\nsome infants RSV leads to bronchi ol it is, one of\nthe major causes of infant hospital is ation in the\nWestern world. And around 40 percent of\ninfants who experience bronchi ol it is as a result\nof RSV infection are subsequently affected by\nrecurring wheeze and asthma in childhood.\nProfessor Peter Openshaw from Imperial\nCollege London at St Mary's Hospital says:\n\"Although there is still no way to prevent babies\nbeing infected by RSV, keeping people with\ncolds away from young babies could reduce the\nchances of infection. Merely delaying infection\nbeyond the first six months could have a significant impact on the later health of a child.\"\nIn tests carried out in mice, researchers were\nable to show that delaying RSV infection can\nhave a significant effect on cytokine production\nand lung pathology during subsequent re-in fec tion.\nDr Fiona Culley from Imperial College London\nat St Mary's Hospital says: \"What is interesting\nfrom the point of view of our understanding of\nimmunology, is just how differently the immune\nsystem deals with RSV infection at different\nages, and the long-term consequences that\nneonatal infection can have on immune\nresponses and pathology later in life.\"\nPrimary RSV infection in newborn mice followed the same viral kinetics as in adults but\nwas associated with reduced and delayed IFNy responses. For the study, mice were infected\nat one day, or one, four or eight weeks, and re-infected at twelve weeks (adulthood). Neonatal\npriming produced more severe weight loss and\nincreased inflammatory cell recruitment to the\nlungs (including T helper 2 cells, neutrophils\nand eosinophils) during re-infection whereas\ndelayed priming led to enhanced interferon\ngamma production and less severe disease during re-infection.\nThe research was made possible through\ngrants from the Wellcome Trust.\nFrom: Journal of Experimental Medicine,\nVolume 196, Number 10, November 18,\n2002.

    "content": "FELIX NIGHTLIFE NightLife Paul van Dyk\n@ Gatecrasher Transmission\nEven though I come from Manchester I'd never been to Gatecrasher (it always seemed\ntoo much of an effort to go over the Pennines\njust for a night out) but knew of its reputation\nas a world leader in upcoming trance and\nknew that it attracted an extremely mad-for-it\ncrowd not averse to painting their hair yellow,\nwearing pink body suits and waving glow-sticks around as if in some kind of fit. I was,\nhowever pleasantly surprised with a very\nfriendly crowd, a very London crowd (i.e. not\nmuch pink hair) and some amazing music.\nAshley Casselle started the night off with\nhis trademark mixture of progressive-tech-house-breakbeat with some hard trance\nthrown in for good measure. He was loving it\nand the crowd responded accordingly, cheering as anthem was mixed seamless ly into\nanthem. By the time he left, the room was\ncompletely packed and you could feel the\nanticipation. As he handed over the decks to\nPaul van Dyk the crowd went wild. This was\nwhat we were here for.\nHe certainly didn't disappoint. I heard a few\npeople say he was too cheesy and some even\nused negative expletives, but for me he did a brilliant job. He played a well paced OV2\nhour) set with periods of uplifting techno followed by periods of sublime melodic trance.\nHe would bring the crowd through a long,\nslow build and then hold them at the point of\nrelease for what seemed like hours. When the\ncrescendo finally exploded into torrents of\nbeats and blips the whole room went insane.\nIt was hands-in-the-air hero worship for all\ninvolved.\nAt the end of his set the room visibly emptied as people decamped to the bars and chill\nout areas, whoever was up next would have a tough job to keep the crowd going.\nLuckily, Nick Riley was totally up to the\ntask. He started his set at a blinding pace to\ntry and keep the crowd interested and they\ndid. Those that left missed a fantastic mixture\nof uplifting trance and techno with some hard\nhouse tucked in there for those that were still\ngoing strong and it was Nick that made my\nnight.\nJust as I had picked up my coat I heard the\nopening lines from \"Music is the Drug\" which\njust happens to be my favourite tune of the\nmoment and has everything good about music\nencapsulated in one song. After that I had to\nleave because whatever came next couldn't have matched the high, it was the perfect end\nto an amazing night.\nI 'll definitely be going again. I seriously recommend you do too.

As you can see (and have\nprobably seen) at the moment we have two\npages to fill a week, and while that may not\nseem like a lot to you, it's amazing how difficult it is to get people to write good stuff and\nactually send it to us. Plus, we want to make\nthis section the biggest and best section in\nFe//x and we can't do it without your help.\nSo, if you've had a brilliant weekend at an\namazing club somewhere and you can't bear\nthe thought of people not knowing about it,\nwrite a review (150-200 words), send it to us\nand we'll do our best to fit it in.\nAlternatively, if you simply have a story that\nneeds to be shared with the rest of the student populous regarding clubbing in some\nform or another (any debauchery, random\ndrinking related injuries, embarrassing\nencounters etc - you get the idea) send it in\nand if we get enough we can start a letters\npage.\nThe third option is to join the reviewing\nteam. This means you can get guest list entry\n+ 1 (usually) to whatever it is we have available that week or if you fancy going to an\nevent, let us know and we'll see if we can sort\nit out for you. All we ask in return is a150200 word review telling us what it was like.\nIt's not hard at all and you get the ultimate\nsatisfaction of seeing your work in print.\nIf you want more information, or have anything to give us, email:\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nTim and Dom\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk Become a Felix reviewer to have your say on all the latest entertainment\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX COMEDY PREVIEW Ray Peacock09 Ray Peacock is vicious, an tag on is tic, \"I go on, banter and try to\nstart fights, I love it\". Not just\namongst the few to have provoked\nglassware to fly stage wards, but\npossibly the only performer to\nhave caught the offending\nobjects. His act is solely about the\ngeneration of anger, within himself and his audience by \"that\nthing of saying unsay able things\".\nTo an American in the audience:\n\"They (the twin towers) used to\nbe the tallest buildings in the\nworld, well now they're the\nwidest\". The only other notable\naspect to Ray Peacock is his arrogance,\" I do talks, public speak-ing,... I educate people. It's my\nduty as an intellectually superior being\". He is as one-dimensional as he sounds,\nwith reason.\nRay Peacock was created\nby Comedian Jon Williams\nas an alter-ego for his friend\nIan Boldsworth. It's clear that\nWilliams used little imagination,\nBoldsworth often displaying the\nstaggering lack of self-awareness\nthat Ray Peacock thrives on. \"You\ncan't teach it\" this former\ndrama student says of act-ing, missing the irony.\nFor such an unreserved,\nalmost aggressive per-son, whose comedy is so\nconfrontational, his in flu Ien ces are surprisingly\nI placid. His hero is Les\nI Dawson. Boldsworth has\npenned both his official biographies, book and film. More\nrecently his inspiration has been\nJohnny Vegas, whose passion he\nparticularly admires \"Johnny just\nhits it. He puts his heart and soul\ninto it, which is really important\".\nIt was perhaps this emphasis on\ncommitment that led Boldsworth\nto enter Ray Peacock as a candidate to be Lord Mayor of London.\nHis campaign slogan: \"Bringing\nmy warm Northern Sensibilities\ninto your cold fucked up shit\nSouthern lives!!\" was predictably\nrobust. Typically though he didn't capital is e on a promising start\nand Peacock failed even to gain\nany meaningful publicity, let alone\nvotes.\nBoldsworth has other high\nambitions for his character, hoping that Ray Peacock will soon\nemulate the \"brilliantly per-formed\" exploits of American\nScott Capurro. With what might\ncharitably be called misplaced\nconfidence, he has put little effort\ninto developing any depth to Ray\nPeacock - he's Northern, cross\nand supercilious, that's all - and a transformation of some proportions will have to occur before he\npossesses even half of Capurro's wit and skill. Boldsworth's technique is simple \"I jig people up in\na funny way,., they get giddy, and\nyou get them giddy, and you're\nkeeping control on stage, but\nlooking like you're giddy, and you\nget a really good feeling in the\nroom, and then you can say anything to anyone.\" As such, an\nevening with Ray Peacock is at\nit's best when he garners a strong\nresponse. Most comedians do not\nrisk this total reliance on circumstances beyond their control, and\nPeacock's hit-and-miss performances show their wisdom.\nThis act is not a smooth progression building laughter along\nthe way, it fluctuates severely,\nPeacock never managing to sustain the energy he creates with his\nsudden outbursts, perhaps just an\ninevitable penalty of their extreme\nnature, but a drawback none the less. Ultimately this man's performance depends on the volatility of his audience, so if you go see\nhim, don't hold back, he loves\nnothing more than a heckle and a knifing.\nPhoto shows bloodstained hands of Arab after\nlynching two young Israelis in Ramallah12/10/2000\n\"The young man was very ill when he was a baby, he stuttered, he was shy ... maybe it\nreally wasn't him photographed in the\nwindow... he was a calm, good-natured and\nathletic kid... \"\n- Article by Daniel Hockstader in the Washington Post, 7 July\n\"Israel simply has no right to exist\"\n\u2022 Article by Faisal Bodi, 23 Jan 2001 Infamous New Statesman cover\n- Jan2002 Why is the Media so anti - Israel?\nMichael Gove - Assistant editor of The Times\n\" Israel, the Media and the Truth\" Tuesday 26th Nov at 6.30pm in the Read Lecture Theatre - Sherfield building\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "COLUMN Going to Church You're at University! You're free,\nanything is possible, no parents, no\nfamily, none of the shackles of that\nplace that you used to live. This is\nLondon, Baby, land of opportunity,\nmost happening centre on the plan-et, place of freedom; kick off your\nshoes, relax your feet and lay back.\nIt's different now, you make the\ndecisions, you write the rules.\nQuestion: where does church fit\ninto all of this? Actually, more\nimportantly, where does God fit into\nall of this?\nLots of people reading this probably call themselves Christian in\nsome way shape or form, and as\nsuch, God and therefore Church\nplay or have played some part in\ntheir life.\nSo where does this fit in your\n'new' life?\nAn often spoken phrase is 'Show\nme your friends, and I 'll tell you\nwho you are'. This can also be said\nlike: 'Show me your five closest\nfriends / the people you spend most\nof your time around, and I 'll tell you\na lot about the life you are living'.\nAnd that says a lot about what\nchurch is.\nIf you call yourself a Christian,\nyou can't do it by yourself. You need\nother Christians around you in a real way. To read and pray is not\nenough, and what's more, you\nbecome like the people you hang\naround with. Not to say you only\never hang around Christians, but\nyou need to be around them.\nAll this said, church does not\nmake you Christian, it however provides a family. We as Christians\nneed a family. Someone to pray for\nus, to encourage us, to pull us up\nwhen we are down, to make us see\nmore of how great God is.\nHopefully you know now why you\nneed to be in a church, and more\nimportantly, you feel the need. You\nwant to be in a church.\nThe second problem is actually\nchoosing a church to go to. In truth,\nLondon has got many brilliant\nchurches, so what to do? How do\nyou choose one? Do you have to\nchoose one?\nHere's a couple of pointers:\nSD G Strategic Decisions Group\nDecisions, Decisions... As you move closer to a decision about your future, you will\ndoubtless have questions about how to satisfy your professional\nambitions while enjoying personal fulfillment. Strategic Decisions\nGroup (SDG) invites you to learn about our rapidly growing global\nstrategic consulting practice and to discover how its distinctive\nculture and excellent opportunities for advancement can match\nyour aspirations.\nWe are seeking candidates for the positions of Business Analyst\nand Associate Consultant. Business Analyst candidates may\nbe undergraduates from any discipline. Associate consultants have\nfurther degrees.\nApplicants for the position of Business Analyst and\nAssociate Consultant for our London office should send a CV and covering letter stating any visa requirements no later than\nJanuary 3, 2003.\nSiona Gehr\nRecruitment Coordinator\nStrategic Decisions Group\n22 The Green\nRichmond\nSurrey TW9 IPX\ns ge hr@s d g. com\n020 8940 7000 Main\n020 8940 0404 Fax\nwww.sd g. com\nDo look around, but don't look\nforever. The temptation can be to\nstick with the first place you come\nacross, don't settle for convenience,\nlook at the different ones you could\nend up in. On the other hand,\nspending your time at university flitting from church to church will get\nyou nowhere. You eventually have\nto choose one place.\nWhen looking, look for Family. A place where you feel at home. Ask\nyourself: are there people at this\nchurch that you feel you can get\nalong with? After all without people\nthe church cannot exist and that\ncan be one of the biggest contributing factors to whether or not you\nfeel at home.\nPay a lot of attention to the teach-ing. Look for teaching that you\nagree with, a good start is to examine their statement of faith. This\nalways reveals a lot.\nThink Vision! Does the church\nhave vision? i.e where they are\ngoing and what they intend doing.\nYou will be going where the church\nis going, so it is important that you\nknow whether that is where you\nwant to go.\nCheck out the worship. What's your flav a? Happy clapp y, Hymnbooks and Organs,\nSomewhere in between? Do you\nfeel comfortable in the way the\nchurch expresses worship to God? If\nnot, would you like to? Worship is a very important part of our walk with\nGod, and the church you join can\nhave a great effect on your worship.\nAnd the most important factor:\ngo to the place that God wants for\nyou. It is worth looking and holding\non for. God doesn't force you, he\nwill not send you to a place that is\ngoing to do you no good, he will put\nyou where you will find out the\nmost about him and get closer to\nhim, so ask him to show you.\nDon't join some cult (there's some out there). What do we\nmean? Some churches have characteristics like claiming to be the\nonly true Christians, an \"If you're\nnot in our church, you're going to\nhell\" attitude. Another trait is a reluctance to let you go.\nThe following is Daphne's story of\nfinding the church God meant for\nher in London. This illustrates many\nof the points that have been raised.\nSee if you can spot them.\nAfter coming to England to study,\nI got involved with a church. A bible-based, definitely Christian\nchurch, passionate about living for\nGod. I got involved, made a lot of\nfriends. The church I was in back\nhome then informed me that there\nwas another church in London that\nwas of the same family as my home\nchurch. This wouldn't have made\nmuch of a difference, but I knew\nthat my church back home was\nwhere I had been put by God for his\nreasons. The knowledge that the\nfamily I had was extended over here\nleft me with a dilemma. To stay\nwhere I was: I had friends, I was\ninvolved, I loved it, or to go to where\nI felt God was calling me to. I mean\nafter all, one church is as good as\nthe next, it's the same God we\nserve, why does it matter which one\nI go to? Also, if I left where I was,\nwhat would happen to all the\nfriends I made? Would they under-stand? Would they think I was just\nbetraying them? It was all too\nmuch, and so for a while I did no th ing. I just kept on as usual, but I didn't feel entirely happy. I knew\nthere was something I was ignoring.\nAfter speaking to my close friends\nabout it, I eventually attended a service at the other church. From\nthe moment I walked through the\ndoor, it felt like home. This is where\nI belonged. I knew this is what I'd been bothered about, and I knew\nwhat I had to do. So, I am now in\nthe church that I believe God has\nput me in, and it's wonderful. As for\nmy fears about my friends, they\nwere not founded. They are still my\nfriends, they are happy that I 've\nfound the place God wants for me.\nAll in all, I'm glad I took the step\nand went where God wanted me.\nWe hope this has been helpful to\nyou. If you need to speak to someone about finding a church or anything Christian, contact: john.her-mes@ic.ac.uk (His People), chaplaincy\u00a9^.ac.uk (Chaplaincy), con-rad_ chan81@ hotmail.com\n(Christian Union).\nWe pray that you will soon be in\na church enjoying everything that\nGod brought you to this great city\nfor.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS mums& Singled* Various 4/5\nShifty Disco -They Actually Like the Records They Release\nAnd so we come to this, a compilation album, by a label that\n\"loves its work\" and \"the records it\nreleases\", or so we are informed.\nWhich seems strange as I would\nassume all labels like their records\nbecause they make money from\nthem in almost all cases.\nShifty Disco seem to think they\nare unique in this attitude and so\npack their compilation with such\nrevolutionary, forward thinking\nand fabulously well known artists\nlike Jackdrag(?) and Schwabd?).\nDespite being a quite obviously\nindependent label from the mecca\nof astonishingly cool nu-music\nthat is, Oxford, they manage to\nput together a pretty solid album\nthat you could easily pass off as\nMutations-era Beck only with\nmore shoe gazing, Quaaludes and\na touch of el c tro clash. Sounds\nbizarre? Its amazing how right\nmost of it sounds.\nWe kick off with AM60, presumably named after a road somewhere in the midlands, who start\noff with a promising drum roll but\nthen become the Beach Boys\nsinging songs by N 'Sync. They follow this with a \"tune\" that would-n't be out of place on an episode\nof Andy Pandy (Younger readers\nmay not understand this refer-en ce. Ask your grandparents). A pleasant enough start, but we\nwant something a bit meatier.\nSo we get Jackdrag, who apparently enjoy getting high with Jesus\nand sound much the same as you\nimagine the twelve disciples\nwould have done just after the\ncrucifixion and some good strong\nherbs. Note good use of the electronic wobble board here.\nFollowing them we get Elf\nPower, who in between fighting\nfor the rights of the magic\nmunchkins among us and having\nafternoon tea with hobbits, manage to sound exactly the same as\nthe last two bands. Amazing !!\nNext up Beulah, who appear to\nhave been named after a vomit\nand claim they had their hearts\nstolen by punk rock.\nUnfortunately, unsubstantiated\nclaims like that won't hold up in a court of law and neither would the\nmusic, especially if the case was\n\"The artists featured on Shifty\nDiscos' compilation versus Beck\nand Brian \"Hey everybody I 've\ngone insane\" Wilson\". Onwards\nthen...\nTo The Young Knives, who win\nthe award for \"Artist most unlike\nBeck on this album\". Bizarrely,\nthey sound a bit like the Sex\nPistols, only much friendlier, and\nbetter at playing instruments.\nExtra points for getting in the\nlyrics to Nick Nack Paddywhack\nas well (people from the South,\ndon't even try and understand this\nreference). All in good fun. Dom\nCave In\nTides of Tomorrow\nPicture the scene, you're a young\nband in Methuen, Massachusetts,\nyou've been playing with your\nmates for a few years now, doing\nit the hard way, gigging constant-ly, taking your music to the masses and trying to build up some\nkind of loyal fanbase who will buy\nyour self released EP's. Eventually, you sign to an independent label and put out an\nalbum that is welcomed with\nopen arms.\nPeople start to listen to your\nspaced out, dizzy, prog-hardcore,\nemo and talking about it in a flattering light, things are going good.\nThen, all of a sudden, Dave Grohl\nannounces that you are his new\nfavourite band and invites you to\nsupport the Foo Fighters on a tour\nof Britain's arenas. Wham!! There\nyou are, straight into the public\n2/5\nconsciousness, people outside\nyour home town start talking\nabout you, people in the media\nwant to do interviews and start\nhyping you as the saviours of\nmusic. In short, you become\nfamous overnight.\nSo what then? Where to go?\nDo you make an album for the\nfans or the record label? Luckily,\nthe decision faced Cave In after\nthey had finished recording this -their third album. Otherwise\nthings could so easily have been\ndifferent. You feel like they're\ndoing it because they want to get\ntheir message (whatever it is) to\nthe kids, they just love playing\nmusic and they don't want the\nhype or attention. \"We just got\nlucky. Don't shoot us!\". It's a very\nmature sounding album for ones\nso young though, kind of like\nRival Schools doing King Crimson\nbut through a Yes filter.\nWhile they may have been hit\nby the press' \"prog\" stick, it's possibly slightly unfair to burden\nthem with that career-killing term\nat this stage. Sure, they don't sound like your average run-of-the-mill emo band, but then who\nwants to listen to something aver-age. Of course, it can be a dangerous game this being different\nthing and its one they don't win\nconvincingly. There isn't enough\npassion in what they do or say\nand sometimes they just fall flat\non their faces, getting bogged\ndown with being clever instead of\nplaying with the passion and honesty that they are capable of. Mr\nGrohl, time for a new favourite\nband.\nDom\nSingles\nNu - Disco Hurts\nClever name, snappy title and a blistering song. Everything is in\nplace for this 4-piece championed by Lauren Laverne and\nClaire Sturgess. Riding along on\na resurgence of (that's right)\nnew-wave, an electronic back beat gives way to a chugging\nBlondie-esque tale of nightlife\nlow life before we hit a wall of\nsound and chorus which many\nthought had been copyrighted\nby Bellatrix. Factory Girl is a2 minute trash in the style of The\nHives - ragged guitar breaks\nand howling harmonies. No\ndoubt this lot will fit in well with\nthe current scene. The thing is,\nwith the likes of the excellent\nYeah Yeah Yeahs around, is\nthere any need for them? We\ncan only wait to see how they'll\nfollow this up.\n4/5 Deepesh\nCorrigan - We're The Wire\nPredictable riff-driven action\nfrom new Irish lads Corrigan.\nPounding bass and crunching\nchords drop to an insistent and\nbarely restrained verse of dark\nlyrics sung through clenched\nteeth, before leaping headlong\ninto desperate bouts of frantic\nshouting, mangled guitars and\nventing of spleen, repeated until\ntedious. Quoting obvious influences like Jesus Lizard and the\nless expected Johnny Cash,\nwhose dark lyrical humour is\nreflected in Corrigan's own,\nthey have the frustrated energy\nof teenage youth confined to\nsmall town life, and have found\nan outlet for it in the cathartic\nrebellion of garage punk.

With this staggering thought in mind,\nwhat could be better then, than an all-informing financial column to keep\nour flock of bourgeois up to scratch?\nSo here it is, debuting three weeks later than first planned, Imperial's very own financial pages. What is it, really? A plethora of boring charts,\ncrunching numbers and frivolous headlines it is not. A wealth of cheesy-yet-pertinent news covering economics, business, finance and politics, as\nyou will find, it very much is. This column will bring you the breaking news\n(albeit constrained somewhat by the time delay caused by me reading it in\nthe FT, putting it in print, getting it into Felix and waiting for Felix to be\nprinted) from the City, get you your IPOs and your MBOs the right way\nround, get you using words like 'leverage', 'yield curve' & 'FTSE', turn your\nmoney into mountains of cash and even do your dishes for you!\nSo! Read what the bankers read, hear what the CEOs hear and see what\nyou fellow job hunters see, right here.

This bit of fun will not come\ncheap for UBS, who will have to take a SFr 1\nbillion in write down f ll. Subsequently, UBS\nalso announced a4% hike in its earnings for the\n3rd quarter, to SFr 942m.

Our\nfirst win of the season was,\nunfortunately a friendly, but has\ngiven us a lush base on which to\nbuild many many more lush\nwins. And all because of the\nMONKEY.\nSussex, an unknown quantity\nto the Virgin's, turned up early,\nin numbers and with a couple of\nbig fat props, but nothing too\nscary.\nKick off led to the first 15\nminutes or so, and we were\ncamped firmly in their 22, giving\nus time to build up essential\nconfidence. Eventually, after\nmany scrum s both ways due to\nlots of poor handling skills giving\nway to knock-ons galore, the\nball made it out to our right\nwinger, Trev. She ran down the\nside-line and, when she was just\nabout to put it over the line was\ntackled, resulting in spillage and\nlost ball trauma. But all was not\nlost, when Ling with some lush\ninsight kicked the ball in the\ndirection in which Priya was\nrunning. Priya scooped up the\nhobbling ball and put it over the\nline for her first try of the sea-son. Yeah baby, lush.\nIn between our moments of\nglory, they slipped one past us to\nscore. Off the back of a scrum,\ntheir fly half received the ball\nand after a couple of mis-tackles\nand some good palming off, she\nmade it to the line. Luckily due\nto some lush intimidation, their\nkicker could not convert the try.\nOur next try involved lots of\nspeed and agility. Helen - our\nlush fly half - took the ball into a maul, this resulted in Ling getting the ball out to Charlotte in\nthe line. She quickly passed it to\nJess at outside centre, who got it\nSport Shorts\nRSM 4 - 2 Holloway\nNo one needed reminding that the\nwe are steely competitors with\nbrass balls, and expecting victory\nto feather the nest they had created at the top of the league, Tailing\nhad watched his vaunted defence\nget torn apart in the first half.\nThen came the resurgence. The\nmighty wind of justice swung in\nfavour of RSM wiping the smiles\noff the Holloway faces. On the\n52nd minute Kan bent one in from\nlong range. Cashback.\nSoon after El Gringo penetrated\nforcefully and popped up\nunchecked to finish calmly at the\nback post. RSM continued to\npress with dangerous Dino removing the aerial threat throughout\nthe midfield. On 67 mins he\nstruck with a finish reminiscent of\nDavid Piatt's goal against Belgium\nin Italia 90.\nDespite the referee's ineptitude,\nwith the last kick of the game Paul\nexploited the moist box by planting his 'seed' deep within the raptures of the gaping net.\nDirty B bought a bit of French\ncomposure to the back line, with\nBen and James providing support.\nToby was sacrificed for Dingo\nwhose enormous towering frame\ninstilled fear into the average ly height ed opposition back four.\nIC I173 GKT\nFrom next week there will be\nnotices up throughout the Union\nBuilding, in Beit Quad, for all\nteams to write their scores on.\nThese will come down when the\nbars close on Wednesday\nnights, for publication in the following Friday's Felix, so make\nsure you add them before then if\nyou want to see your team's scores in print.\nJust remember to add your\nteam's details, those of the\nopposition, and the result.\nout to Priya who ran at least half\nof the pitch avoiding numerous\ndefenders to score under the\nposts. The conversion didn't quite make it, but let's face it,\nwe can't all be perfect.\nThe second half led to them\nmanaging to hold us up more\nbut they still didn't manage to\nput any real pressure on us. This\nbrings us to out last try. After a good afternoon of back's work,\ncredit must go to the good quick\nhands down the line. The ball\nwas passed from the back of the\nscrum ending up in Priya's hands, yes she was there again,\nbut she was deprived of a hattrick by a tackle, the ball went to\nground but was picked up by the\nagile Ash who put the ball right\nin the corner.

    "content": "MUSIC FELIX RABID SPOUTING FR DM THE EDITORS... It's been a tough week for your favourite edi-tors. Deadlines, vivas and a distinct lack of\nFelix editorial drinks have taken their toll,\nwhich may explain the slightly shorter film sec-tion. But I did manage to drag myself to an arthouse cinema. I'm not entirely sure about such\nplaces. They always seem a little weird. The\nGate in Notting Hill is no exception. All the\nbeautiful people of Notting Hill queue up outside for ages before paying full London prices\nfor the privilege of sitting in an uncomfortable\nseat positioned directly behind unnaturally tall,\nwide men with hats on. There's no doubt the\ntheatre itself is beautiful, in that k itch gold-span gly way that many auditoriums are, but\nfrankly when I'm paying 7 quid a pop I would\nlike to see more than half the screen, so a little angling of the floor wouldn't go amiss. The\nscreen was smaller than your average Odeon,\nand the sound system was the country bumpkin cousin of Dolby Surround Sound, but since\nI wasn't watching a blockbuster it didn't really\nmake a difference. However, as far as cinema\naudiences go, they were fantastic. More used\nto the kind of crowd who are smoking spl iff s before the trailers are through and laugh\nthroughout regardless of what's on, I was very\npleasantly surprised by the posh, wannabe-Bohos. And they clapped at the end! I have\nexperienced this before, but only with Star\nWars, and that's different. Maybe there's something in this arty lifestyle thing. I'm not\nplanning to move to Hoxton just yet, but I might consider the occasional return to an arthouse cinema. Now I just have to find one\nshowing something I might actually want to\nsee... Liz\nBFIeugh. This Week has been far too much\nlike hard work. I promise far more content next\nweek, but for now BOBBINS!

BUSH, CHARLTON HESTON, LOTS DF DUMB AMERICANS WITH GUNS MICHAEL MOORE151 ZD MINS15 TH NOVEMBER whether to take the piss out of the Yanks for\nbeing that dumb or cry because these are the\npeople who populate (and run?) the last\nremaining superpower.\nMichael Moore could be seen as the equivalent\nof our own Mark Thomas, a quirky blok e who\nuses political satire and documentary-style\nfilming to get laughs. Except, this blok e is actually funny, and what's more, he says some pretty important stuff in his new, Special-JuryPrize-at-Cannes-winning documentary on\nschoolyard shootings in America.\nThe idea of going to see a2 hour documentary at the cinema (and a ponce y art-house one\nat that) did not inspire me that much, but I figured a15 minute standing ovation at the\nworld's premier film festival must count for\nsomething, so off I trotted. And I have to say, I have never been so glad I ignored my gut\ninstincts. The film was utterly fantastic.\nIt began with a series of clips and interviews\nestablishing the ridiculous nature of America's gun culture. Moore waltzed into a bank offering\na free gun with every account opened, where\nthe staff did not seem to share his concerns\nabout arming strangers inside a building containing vast sums of money. Then he went for a haircut, and got something for the weekend at\nthe same time. No party popper s here, nor condoms for that matter - the barber handed over\nbullets for Moore's newly acquired gun. Cue\nsome footage of the \"Michigan Militia\" who\ntouted guns but couldn't do up their own belts,\nand an interview with the brother of one of the\nOklahoma bombers (who himself was ques-tio ned, but let off for lack of evidence), and we\nwere all squirming in our seats and laughing\nwith that slightly incredulous, embarrassed\nlaugh. You know the one - you're not sure\nAn American. With a gun.\nThe laughs kept coming - a blind man with a gun licence?! A man accidentally shot by a dog?! Surely only in America. Well, yes, actual-ly. That's the point Moore is making - only in\nAmerica. What the rest of the film tries to\nanswer is why America has over 11,000 gun\nkillings each year when other countries rack up\nless than 200. He uses video footage, interviews and news clips to suggest the currently\nfavoured reasons behind such a huge death\ntoll, expertly, wittily denouncing each one,\nmainly through reference to other countries\nwho face the same sociological evils (video nas-ties, computer games and the beast everyone's parents love to hate, Marilyn Manson). They\ndon't go around killing each other, why should\nthe Americans?\nCombined with the sharp and humorous\nsocial commentary is a more harrowing element - the schoolyard killings of Columbine and\nBuell. The use of actual CCTV images and real\n911 calls is crushing - the audience's laughter\nwas quickly reversed to tears, and I actually felt\nthat cold wave of horror ripple through me.\nGoing from side-splitting to tear-jerking is not\neasy, but Moore manages to do so smoothly,\nretaining the narrative framework he has established through the juxtaposition of images and\nmusic. There is a little use of narration - the\nexpert editing and weaving together of snippets\nof film from Moore's own investigation, news\nreports and vox-pops requires little in the way\nof augmentation.\nThe ideas and theories Moore presents are\ngenerally sound and always thought-provoking.\nThere are a few instances where he seems to\nlose his edge and appears to be almost playing\nfor laughs, something which detracts from his\notherwise precise comedy. There are also a few\ncringe-worthy moments, including the interview with pro-gun lobbying Charlton Heston,\nwho is stooped and frail as he dodders away\nfrom an increasingly ardent Moore. Some\nwould argue that if Heston is to continue to head\nthe National Rifle Association, he ought to be prepared to take on such discourses, but it was\nuncomfortable to watch, especially in light of the\ndifficult emotional ride Moore had already orchestrated. Nevertheless, a similar scene, where\nMoore took two Columbine survivors to the convenience store where the bullets were bought,\nwas satisfying and heartening, a far cry from the\nirritating guerrilla documentary making so often\nseen.\nMoore's film is intense, and a difficult cinema\nexperience, but it is also important and funny and\nmoving. Perhaps the laughter was harder and\nlouder because of the uncomfortable subject mat-ter, the tears silent and shocking because of the\nhumour. I don't know, but I do know that this film\nis spectacular. No special effects, no famous cast,\njust a guy with something to say. And everyone\nshould listen.\nLiz\nWHAT TO WATCH....

    "content": "1 4 ARTS& THEATRE FELIX An Evening of Blues Sammy\nTheatre Royal Stratford East\nIf like me, you go expecting the\nstory of Sammy Davis Jr to be\ntold in chronological order you\nwill be surprised. The story\ntelling tool used is unconventional and revolves around the\naudition process for a forthcoming fictional musical about\nSammy Davis Jr. At times the\nlack of actual story line can\ncause your attention to waver as\nthere is no suspense or intrigue.\nIt is however an inventive idea.\nThe facts, where you learn\nabout his life, are from the snippets of conversation exchanged\nbetween the hopefuls who are\nauditioning for the main part\nand the passionate man, Hillard\nElkins (portrayed by Peter\nStraker) who is putting them\nthrough their paces. You learn\nwhat Sammy Davis Jr meant to\nblack performers at the height of\nhis fame and what his memory\nmeans to a new generation of\nperformers.\nHis songs, including 'Rhythm\nof Life', 'Mr Bojangles' and 'That\nOld Black Magic', and the tap\nperformed by this young group\nof actors gives you an insight\nand understanding of the mind\nof a man who has been credited\nby some with inventing the\nblues.\nAt times the voices chosen\nmay not give these amazing\nsongs the justice they deserve.\nHowever, Peter Straker has an\namazing blues voice which\ntransports you to a different time\nand place.\nThe skills of the pianist and\nflutist/saxophonist, which are on\nthe stage and as much a part of\nthe action as the actors, are also\namazing. There is a particularly\ninteresting scene where Lolade\nFalana (portrayed by Ngo Ngofa)\nand the pianist have a tap-piano playing battle - it has to\nbe seen.\nThis all paints a picture that\nallows you to see how Sammy\nDavis Jr battled against convention to achieve what was considered at the time unreachable:\nfame as a black performer to be\nenjoyed by black people.\nDespite not learning many historical facts you gain something\nmore important, hearing his\nlegacy of amazing songs, brings\nalive the mood and culture of\nthe time and illustrates how one\nman can change provide inspiration across generations.\nShowing from the 11th November 2002.\n23rd Rooms Full of Colour Masters of Colour: Derain to Kandinsky\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nQuick, quick, quick! Although you\ndon't have much time left to catch\nthis exhibition it is definitely worth\nrushing for.\nThe exhibition includes outstanding examples of European\nand North American painting and\nsculpture from Impressionism to\nAbstract Expressionism, concentrating on the work of painters who\nwere chiefly concerned with colour\nand its effect. Indeed the dominant theme of the entire collection\nis the development in the way\ncolour was used in twentieth century art. The exhibition is a clear\ndemonstration of how vibrant\ncolour can be used for a direct\ntranscription of light, as a vehicle\nfor powerful emotions, or as a means for conveying abstract\nideas.\nIt is interesting in itself to see\nnearly a century of artwork, by\nmany different artists brought\ntogether under one heading, and\nwith each of the four galleries\ndevoted to the work of a different\ngroup of artists you can piece\ntogether the historical context of\neach work.\nGallery one features the\nImpressionists, who were the first\nto take full advantage of the many\nbright pigments that had recently\nbecome available. Artists like\nMonet and Sisley endeavored to\ncapture the vibrations of light by\napplying these bright colours\nun mixed, this spontaneous style\nchanged the definition of a finished work of art.\nGallery two is dedicated to the\nFauves, the best known of whom\nare Matisse, Derain, Vlaminck and\nBraque. All employed colour\nwhich was unnatural, aggressive\nand even savage. This gallery also\ncontained the painting that has\nstuck in my mind was 'Form of\nYellow (Notre Dame)' by FrantisekKupka, it is a highly abstracted,\nexciting work which can be read in\nmany different ways and is perhaps reason enough to go and\nexperience the flood and wash of\ncolour which will surround you.\nThe last two galleries contain\nwork by Der Blaue Reiter and\nGerman Expressionism.\nSplitting the galleries into particular artistic movements provides a brief introduction to art\nhistory for those who are unsure,\nas well as providing clarity to what\ncould have been an over w helm ing experience.\nShowing from the 27th July until\n26th November 2002. You have\nto be quick!\narts.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "3 0 SPORT FELIX Level at LSE\nIC I11 LSE\nWe were really fired up for the\ngame - LSE had beaten us 10\ndays previously - and couldn't wait to get into it get ours back.\nThey decided to turn up half\nan hour late, which pissed us off\neven more, so as soon as the\ngame started we showed our\nintentions. Going totally into\nevery challenge, we established\nour superiority, from the start.\nWe looked solid at the back,\ngood going forward, were creating chances and looking more\nlikely to score. Joss's volley went\njust wide, and his header deflected off a defender. Then they\nstarted coming forward and got a penalty when their striker stumbled on to Hendrik. Carlos\nthough knew where their man\nwas going for, making a great\nsave in the bottom right corner.\nAfter about 5 minutes a great\npiece of play by us, involving\nabout 6 players, switched play to\nthe left, for a spot-on cross by\nAnt to Joss who headed it coolly\npast the keeper. Almost straight\nafter a cross came in from the\nleft, but Dave put it wide, then\nHendrik's header forced their\nkeeper to a magnificent save.\nWe decided to keep the lead at\nhalf time, we stepped out again,\nnot looking as sharp though for\nthe first 15 minutes which\nallowed them to settle for a bit\nthen after a blatant push on\nAlan,which the referee never saw\ntheir striker managed to score.\nThat woke us up, and we\nstarted battling, and missed even\nmore chances. Oli's shot going\njust wide, when everyone\nthought it was in, Mark's free\nkick that their keeper just saved,\npushing the ball on the bar, and,\nfollowing some great football by\nus, Mark one on one with the\nkeeper, putting the ball just wide.\nDon't think he can miss that\nagain, even if he tries.\nWell, sometimes, some things\nare just not meant to be.\nRH Cut Down\nIC 135 - 87 RHUL\nA relatively small but perfectly\nformed fencing team made their\nway to deepest darkest Eghamin the dark heart of Surrey - to\nthwart the threat of the 'almost\nlondon' wannabes.\nDue to careers fair and some\nextremely strange fixture planning this was the first match\nthat we had played for four\nweeks, since our trouncing of\nthe novice Sussex team 135-53,\nwhich is a massive margin in\nanyone's estimation.\nAfter arriving - and just about\non time too - we were greeted by\nwhat seemed to be a seriously\nunder-strength Holloway team.\nAnd so it indeed proved to be, as\nwe managed to win the first\nweapon, sabre, without a single\nsabre ur. Big Daddy Rob, Yugo\nHugo and Handbag Hughes all\nturned their hands to an unfamiliar weapon and their winning\nwas clearly a good omen.\nEven better than these first\nsteps to victory was the crippling\nhead shot dished out by Yugo\nhalfway through the second\nweapon that reduced their\nalready seriously under strength\nteam to a mere pair of fresher s. This left a victory in the foil\ninevitable, with Yugo, Handbag\nand Genius Phil ensuring a wide\nvictory margin.\nAfter an deeply uncharacteristic surge of compassion on our\npart, we decided to let them\nsubstitute on the only other\nfencer present before the e pee encounter took place.\nUnperturbed by the uncharacteristic pair of X chromosomes\nthat were on offer, we stuck to\nthe task at hand, as we were\neager to get to the pub as quickly as possible.\nSolid performances all round\nagain from Big Daddy, Yugo and\nHandbag sealed the victory and\nit was off down the bar to eat,\ndrink and prove our ignorance of\ngeneral trivia.\nKent Defeated LSE Thrashed\nIC I20 Chichester\nAfter practising our cricket skills\noutside the union we headed\noff, once again, to defend our\nseemingly impregnable fortress\nat Harlington.\nThe IC Cavaliers started like\nan absolute bunch of muppets,\nbut fortunately for us Kent were\neven worse. The early\nexchanges seemed to go to us,\nwith Stinky, Toadfish and\nBoyzone looking imperious in\nthe midfield.\nThe - much better looking - IC\nteam continued to improve and\na period of immense pressure\nresulted in two penalty flicks\nbeing awarded in our favour.\nThe first stormed past the keep-er, skillfully glancing off the\ninside of the post. The second,\nhowever was an absolute and\ntotal ball monkey of an attempt\ngoing wider than anyone ever\nthought possible.\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nWith the score at 1-0\nGeography Teacher put Gump\nthrough, who slipped it to Star\nWars on the flick spot. The Kent\nkeeper went down quicker than\nStar Wars' bird, allowing him to\nmake it 2-0.\nWith Boyzone and Trailer no.\n2 screaming like girls we somehow managed to let two goals in\nto let them claw it back to 2-2.\nAfter Star Wars put IC back on\ntop in the last few minutes nut-m egging the keeper from three\nyards, Villager decided to pass a ky r der straight to their centre\nforward - tw at on the top of the\nD with a double hit/slap. He\nalso managed to collapse on the\nastro, though we have no idea\nhow. Luckily the Ump blew for\ntime just as he was striking the\nball but he still missed - lucky\nVillager.\nSo, despite the Fortress being\nViolated twice we came away\nwith a legendary win - the legend continues.\nIC I110 LSE I Well, today the IC goal machine\nwas well and truly up and run-ning, hammering LSE 11-0. We\nwere unstoppable from start to\nfinish, and LSE really had no\nclue how to stop a legendary\nperformance.\nBoyzone bundled past the\nodd defender before unleashing\na legendary reverse-stick effort\nto nudge the well oiled machine\ninto a deserved lead. Zoolander\nthen came up with two of his\ntrademark looping drag-flicks to\nput IC into a commanding 3-0\nlead. Some more seriously slick\nbuild up play led to star wars\ngetting a shooting opportunity.\nHe duly let fly and such was the\npower of the shot that\nZoolander could have flown to\nPoland before the ball 'hit' the\nback of the goal. Boyzone then\nmashed another from the edge\nof the D to make it 5-0.\nAfter the half time break and\nVillager's bunch of bananas the\npace was kept up and some\nastonishing moves were put into\nplay. Boyzone led the band by\nexample, and knocked another\nreverse stick shot into the goal\nto complete his hat-trick.\nThe next deposit into the IC\ngold card account came from\nStar Wars who simply walked\nround the keeper. Gump decided to fight back, putting one\nshot straight under the keeper\nand 'square cutting' his second\nto assure us all that he should-n't get a jug for not scoring.\nThen LSE somehow managed to\nmiss Stinky's stench, as he\nunleashed Hell from the top of\nthe D and neatly into the top\ncorner.\nFinally old GT managed to finish from his third attempt and\nscore from three yards and the\nmatch was complete. Wonder if\nthey'll bother to turn up next\ntime... the legend continues.\nMy brain is the consistency of semolina...\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX COLUMN Editorial\nBurble burble burble. I 've just\nbeen informed that I always end\nmy editorial by spouting bollocks\nfor the final few sentences, so this\ntime I thought I'd save us all the\ntime and get it out of the way at\nthe start. Then I can write whatever I want to my heart's content,\nwithout fear of retribution.\nI 've been away, editorial-y speaking, for the last few weeks,\nand now I'm back. I feel rather like\na rapper who has just released\ntheir second album, the title of\nwhich is obviously Rap-Attak. The\nfirst song would probably have\nlyrics along the lines of:\n\"Big up to my bitches, and big\nup to my boyz: with top up fees\nand mergers, it's time to make\nsome noise. To get all yo' at ten tion, I don't even have to cough;\nI'm white, I went to Eton, and my\nname is MC Toff...\"\nNot that this has any bearing on\nanything, of course, but I feel it\nimportant not to ignore my artistic\nside. I 'll say something useful in\nthis column, though, don't you\nfret.\nSo yes. You may have read or\nnoticed or been informed that this\nmerger is now off. I personally\nthink this is a great shame,\nbecause I was getting all sorts of\nadvertising and letters and stuff\n(which means I have to write less\nmyself), and I was also very excited to see that students actually\ncared about something. It's a shame, admittedly, that we all\nhave to be so negative: I have\nnever seen such a level of reaction is m in all my life. \"Merger?\nWith UCL? I'd rather eat my personal tutor\" I heard. \"We know\nwhat's best for students. We are\nstudents!\" Was another classic.\nThis from the demographic of individuals who class a double shot of\nvodka as the best cure for a hang-over.\nBut anyway, it's all over now. I quite liked the idea: the only way\nit could have worked, as far as I can tell, is that each college would\nhave gone on very much as\nbefore, and we would have only\nbeen the same uni from an administrative point of view. What does\nthat mean? Well, if you'd decided\nthat you should have been doing\nEnglish Lit as opposed to Elec Eng\n(and a lot of people do), you could\nchange without having to change\nuni, whereas now the best you\ncan do is go to Materials.\nBut as I say, that's all gone, and\nso we can now all close ranks and\nfight the evil oppression of top up\nfees. Unusually for me I do agree\nwith the masses that they're a bad\nidea, although I don't think that\nfree university education is necessarily a right: I like graduate tax\nmore, or even free education to\nthose who agree to do something\nuseful (like become a teacher) for\na couple of years after graduation,\nand those of us who go to the city\ncan pay graduate tax.\nThere's an interesting story\nassociated with this, actually. I was talking to one of the heads of\nthe 'No To Top Up Fees' protest\nthat happened a few weeks back,\nand he (that's all you're getting\nout of me) was telling me that\nwhat he called 'vocational\ndegrees' such as media studies\nand fitness should be charged,\nand that 'academic' studies\nshould be free. The justification,\napparently, being that physics and\nengineering are practical, whereas\nthese other degrees are not.\nTherefore all these people who do\nphysics and then go and work in\nthe city (nothing to do with\ndegree) have a right to free education that those who do media\nstudies and then go and work in\nthe media (everything to do with\ndegree) do not. Call me old fashioned, but it sounded like intellectual fascism to me. If someone\ncan reasonably explain this to me,\nplease do write in.\nMy point? Well, be careful\nunder whose banner you protest,\nbasically. And also: you're probably not cynical enough.\nm per iai liege\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The rector sent a letter to all\nstudents and staff on Monday outlining his reasons for the collapse of talks at this preliminary\nstage.\nWhile Sir Richard claimed that \"it has\nalready become clear that the best interests of\nour two institutions are not served by a formal\nmerger\", he went on to say that this had been\na useful exercise, hinting that informal collaboration with UCI may still be a very real\nprospect.\nThis break may have come as a surprise to\nsome, since many of the papers presented by\nacademics at Imperial have seemed quite positive. However, Felix has learned that many senior academics claim that the papers were motivated far more on a political level, than by true\nrepresentation of the average staff member. On\ntop of this, upon reading several of the papers\nthat Felix acquired, it was clear that they were\nArtist's Impression of Merger Breakdown\nbeing written within the framework of an\nImperial takeover rather than a true merger.\nIt would seem, however, that the real reasons\nfor the breakdown are mainly within the executive of UCL. One senior academic source\ndescribed the situation as \"More of a rape than\na marriage\", and it is clear that this feeling was\nechoed all the way down through the college\nhierarchies.\nOne reason for the different feelings between\nthe two academic bodies may be due to the relative stability that Imperial enjoys compared to\nthe scientific departments within UCL: if the\nmerger was attempted and failed, Imperial\nwould suffer considerably less.\nIn the past UCL academics have been instrumental in the ousting of a provost, and it is\nclear that whatever the true situation at this\nend, they were not happy with the idea of a merger, and thus presented a serious risk of not\ntaking this lying down. Rumblings within\nCollege have suggested that Sir Richard decided that going against such strong opinion may\nnot be worth the effort, when a more subtle\napproach may yield better results.\nIf this is true, we can expect to see much\ngreater collaboration between the two universi-ties' departments, and this may well be just the\nbeginning of something that will happen over a much longer time scale.\nwill\nFelix Website Launch\nAfter eight weeks of intensive pro-g ramming, the Felix website is\ngoing to be launched on Monday.\nThe new site will be a comprehensive web version of the paper\nissue, and will have many added\nfeatures as well.\nWhile the site has been up for\nsome weeks now, it has been\nmainly a reproduction of the paper\nissue, and was being used primarily as a testing ground for new\nideas.\nThe new site has been built by\nAlisdair Wren, a final year computing student. It has been constructed with ease of use for both\nreaders and editors in mind, and\nmany of the features are back\nend, allowing editors to enter their\ncontent in both the weekly issues\nand in web-only sections.

Remember that we strongly recommend that any Nigerian, Japanese, Korean or\nBrazilian students follow suit by Tuesday\nafternoon, as the BIGs (see below) are revving\ntheir typewriters and are carefully abstaining\nfrom research in an effort to prevent Prejudice\nDispellation (a BIG working hazard).\nDiary: The Spanish society seem to be having their annual Fiesta soon. (4th of\nDecember) - see the walkway for more\ndetails. Whilst you're there, keep your eyes\nskinned for the Singaporean Soc advert for\nthe RaRa show. This seems to be in February;\ncheck their website nearer to then for details.\nhttp://union.ic.ac.uk/singapore\na nous Molesworth I say \"down with uni!\"\nOnto non-IC events. A couple of films at the\nICA look very worthwhile. Sans Soleil\n(France,1982) by Chris Marker comes with\nlots of plaudits, and I 'll certainly try to get\nalong to it. The director of Santa Sangre\n(lt aly,1989), Alejandro Jodorowsky apparently asks \"of film what most North Americans\nask of psychedelic drugs\" which sounds\nrather entertaining. (Though does he mean he\nwants a war declared on it?)\nMeanwhile if you're interested in things\nrelated to Africa, the Africa Centre in Covent\nGardens is worth a look. They have a couple\nof music events on soon. Ayetoro, Afro Beat\nJazz from Nigeria is on tonight (Nov 22nd), whilst on Nov 29th they have Ziwawa Stovkel\nNight: apparently a showcase of South\nAfrican musical styles. In both cases, see\nwww.africa centre. org.uk/ for more details and\nfor future events.\nMoving on from diary matters, any remaining international societies who haven't heard\nfrom us yet should email us; we don't have\nup-to-date contact details for all of you, so\nyou may not be aware that we're trying to get\nin contact. If you let us know when you're\nhaving events we can put them in the Diary,\nand we'll try to send someone along to review\nthem. Incidentally, we're also looking for\nmore reporters, so anyone interested in\nreviewing the international societies' events\nshould also email us.\nOn the BIG's hit list for the week after next\nare Sri Lanka, Cyprus, Malaysia and Finland.\nResidents of these countries (or anywhere\naltruistic) are advised that they have until\nTuesday the 3rd of December to write something to prevent a BIG review. Edmund\nFirst things first: Trinidad is not\nanother name for Jamaica, nor is\nit in Jamaica, or even near it\n(about 1000 miles away)!\nThe twin island republic of\nTrinidad and Tobago, is located in\nthe Caribbean, just off the coast\nof Venezuela. Area: about 5000\nsq km; Population: 1.3 million\n[c.f. U.K.=244,820 sq km;\n59.8 mil]; capital: Port of Spain.\nAbout 40% of the people are of\nEast Indian descent, another\n40% of African descent, and the\nremainder are mixed, white and\nChinese.\nWe were a British colony for\nmore than 150 years, and gained\nindependence in 1962, hence\nthe official language is English.\nEnough boring facts for one day.\nFor the prospective tourists\nwho smoke, NEVER ask for a 'fag', because in Trinidad, a 'fag'\nis a gay person, and you may be\nsubjected to physical abuse. A pack of cigarettes only costs\nabout \u00a30.90 though. Those into\nthe harder stuff should ask for\n'ses', 'ganja', 'greens' or 'herbs',\nand a spl iff costs about \u00a30.70:\nall grown locally with no threat of\nGenetically Modified grass. (I assure you this is \"based on second hand information\", and marijuana is illegal in Trinidad). Our\nnational beer is called 'Carib',\nT II [ J!|i DAD with an ABV of about 6%. A pint\nwill set you back about \u00a30.60.\nMany nightclubs in Trinidad offer\nfree drinks all night (or until you\nare totally hammered!) to university students for a mere \u00a32.\nOur national festival is called\nCarnival. Yes, it's similar to\nNotting Hill Carnival and Rio\nCarnival, but we have the honour\nof inventing it. It's usually a few\ndays before Lent begins, and has\nall the worldly delights of Rio's carnival. Be prepared to gyrate\nand 'wine' (no other explanation\nbut sex with your clothes on,\nwhile on the dance floor) to the\nbeat of 'calypso' (our national\nmusic), and Jamaican dancehall.\nAs a Caribbean island we are\nsurrounded by sun, sea and sand,\nand if you are lucky [or fast - Ed]\nyou may catch some of the nude\nsunbathers.\nSome of our more famous\nnationals include cricketer Brian\nLara, sprinter [& sunbather\ncatcher] Ato Boldon, and Dwight\n'Jordan's baby isn't mine - I swear!' Yorke, of Manchester\nUnited fame.\nFor more Trinidad info go to\nhttp://www.visit tnt. com/\nHope to see you in Trinidad\nsoon, and don't forget your sun-block! Reza Mohammed\nLast week I forgot the William\nBrown books, by Richmal\nCrompton. Set in the 1930s, they're aimed primarily at children. Genuinely funny, they'll\nalso improve anyone's vocabulary no end. This is not the case\nwith another series to deal with\n\"skool s\" and small boys; the\nMolesworth books (Geoffrey\nWillans with brilliant illustrator\nRonald Searle), a great satire of\n1950s public schools. (NB: in\nBritain, a fee paying institution,\nnot a state school) The eponymous hero of the Adrian Mole\nbooks (Sue Townsend) starts as a schoolboy, but rather older that\nMolesworth and at a more representative type of school. Twinges\nof embarrassment are liable to be\nfrequent, as Adrian's \"painful\"\nadolescence sparks memories [of\nthe \"they'd be sorry if I died\"\ntype]. In film, Kevin and Perry Go\nLarge, with comedians Harry\nEnfield and Kathy Burke also\npokes fun at adolescents, with a rather large stick.

    "content": "1 8 MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX It Bjork\nGreatest Hits\nBjork's not the first artist you'd think of, when it comes to releasing 'Greatest Hits' albums, and\nthis surprising move from the\nadorable Icelandic pixie has\nraised the age-old question -cash-in or definitive collection?\nWith less than a hint of bias,\nI'm gonna go for definitive colle c tion. It's been nine glorious years\nsince she left the Sugarcubes and\npunk behind her, and since then\nshe has continued to make beautiful and challenging music, a tricky mix by anyone's standards.\nThe record opens with the\nuplifting All Is Full Of Love.\nFleeting strings merge with subtle\nkeyboards, the ambience perforated by a heavily filtered drum-beat. Then Bjork starts singing.\nAnd you float. The music is\n4/5\ndensely layered and yet it feels so\nlight and airy. Her vocal style,\nunparalleled, unmistakable, inimitable, is particularly strong on\nthe an the mic Play Dead. Opening\nwith a scream/sing/thing of unbelievable emotional intensity, she\ngoes on to whisper, sing and\ngrowl her way through the track -aspiring female vocalists take\nnote. Her stirring and evocative\nlyrics couple seamless ly with the\ntheatrical orchestral arrangement.\nAdd this to the impressive percussion and bass lines and you have\na song that is very hard not to feel\na part of.\nBjork is indeed the complete\nartist and she shows her ugly side\non the merciless Army Of Me. A distinctly vitriolic tune composed\nof dark bass lines, lo-fi metallic\nbeats and distorted guitars.\n\"If you complain once more,\nyou'll meet an army of me\". One\nangry pixie.\nEvery song on this album\nstands out like a neon sore\nthumb. Despite the fact that the\ntracks all have very different\nstrengths they do have unifying\nfactors. Firstly and obviously, her\nvoice; secondly and somewhat\nironically, their eclectic it y( made\nthat up). Bachelorette is tango\nwith electronica beats - awesome,\nbut honestly, where did that come\nfrom? Hidden Place is another\nexample; Inuit choir + strings +\nbeats + Bjork = Stunning. You\nknow a record is good when an\nartist claims that All Is Full Of\nLove, and you start to believe\nthem. Dr Monkeez\nTLC\n3D3/5 Let's get right to the crux of the\nissue - TLC's new album 3D released a few months after the\ndeath of member Lisa 'Left Eye'\nLopes - is thankfully low on sentiment and high on beats. With\nmen of the moment The\nNeptunes on board, they look\nforward to reclaiming the title of\nWorld's Best Girl Group from\nDestiny's Child.\nTheir mission gets off to a good\nstart - Quickie takes the sass of\nCrazysexycool and welds it to the\nmusical innovation of Fanmail, in\nthe form of twisting, spiralling\nR'n' b mini-epic. Forthcoming single Girl Talk does a good job of\nmatching its billing as \"the new\nmillennium female anthem\" with\nits funky chorus and clever\nhooks; it picks up where No\nScrubs left off, and is the kind of\nthing Ashanti, Maya et al. would\ndo if they were any good.\nThe obligatory tribute to Lopes,\nTurntable, comes from the pen of\nschmaltz king Rodney Jerkinsso no need to describe what that\nsounds like. However, it is certainly a heartfelt song and\ndeserves respect.\nIn Your Arms Tonight is the\ntrack produced by the current\nrulers of the pop landscape The\nNeptunes, and is completely different to Turntable. It's cutting\nedge and sexy, thanks to the\ntrademark synths that did so\nmuch for Britney, Justin and\neveryone else riding the coat tails\nof Pharrel Williams and co.\nDamaged is what Turntable\ncould've been - essentially\n\"Unpretty - version 2\". It's just a very sweet pop song.\n3D is far from perfect. Dirty\nDirty is a below par shot at the\nMissy Elliot sound, and Hands\nUp is plodding and dreary, as is\nthe tail end of the album, which\nunfortunately lacks fresh ideas.\nArtists such as Alicia Keys and\nthe aforementioned Elliot are\nreinventing the urban female\nsound originally pioneered by\nTLC. Where they were once the\nleaders of a movement, they are\nnow merely worthy disciples -this is the ultimate conclusion\ndrawn from 3D. That said, Lopes\nwould be proud of the girls - for\nthis is a strong and admirable\nstatement in the face of fierce\nadversity. Robin Som\nCOMPETITION TIME\nFelix has five copies of J Walk's A Night on the Rocks album to give\naway.\nAll you have to do is tell me\nwhere both they, and labelmates\nRae and Christian hail from.\nEmail your name and department to the usual address.\nGood Luck!\nSingles\nA Something's Going On\nListening to A is a bit like\nwatching (old) repeats of The\nSimpsons. You pretty much\nknow what to expect; but that\ndoesn't stop it being great.\nAlthough the band have\nstressed that their current\nalbum is a more serious affair,\nthat still hasn't stopped them\nbeing labelled as the fun-lov-ing scamps of rock. They're\ncertainly not helping their\ncause by releasing bouncy\npop-punk like this.\nA chugging base line is followed by Jason Perry's trademark squawk, and the rest is\nas you'd expect from A; name-ly, an instantly memorable\ntune that you'll need an industrial sized crowbar to remove.\nThey say familiarity breeds\ncontempt: If this is contempt,\nI'd like some more!\n4/5 Deepesh PateI\nSI Futures - Eurostar\nThe 3rd single from the Mark\nRadcliffe favourites sees them\nditch their ultra-minimalist\napproach for something that\nyou could actually foresee\npeople taking notice of.\nAfloat y, voc oder tinged\nvocal is laid over the top of a beat that is close to drum 'n' bass proportions. It's sort of\nwhat you'd expect if Air and\nFrou Frou mixed up their master tapes.\nThe track bounds along\nwith intent but is missing that\nspark which made debut single We Are Not A Rock Bond\nsuch a pleasure. Their singles\nshow that the duo are full of\nideas. Hopefully, with the success of contemporaries My\nComputer, they'll be able to\nput them on a great album.\n3/5 Deepesh Patel\nFeatures and Interviews are\ncoming your way next week!\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk One quarter of my ceiling fell down and nobody cares!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX COLUMN07 Wye 'Sup\nCharity Week 2002\nGreetings again Londoners. Since\nI last did a little article, I 've had\nexactly... let me count... one item\nsent to me to put in and even that\ndidn't reach my email. I think this\nmust be tainted. Anyway, before I get started, I have some ranting to\ndo. The last article I wrote didn't have my name attached to it. And\nthat annoyed me somewhat. So\nthis time, instead of waiting to be\nmissed out again, I'm going to tell\nyou who I am. I am Beci. There\nwe go! Wasn't that difficult now,\nwas it? There's a good little\nEditor.\nRight. Down to it. We've just\nhad our Charity Week (or Rag\nWeek to some). This year it was\nfor two fantastic causes, namely\nKent Air Ambulance and the\nCambridge University Department\nfor Brain Tumour Research. Both\nof these causes have supported\nex-students of ours, one of whom,\nEd Notts, sadly passed away\nrecently.\nThe week started with a rather\nwet bang. We had our traditional\nBonfire and Fireworks. This took\nplace on the Crown, a( yes, you\nguessed it) crown carved into the\nNorth Downs. This was completely lit up with hundreds of\nscrounged industrial-sized baked\nbean cans, that Sarah (our Union\nVice President) had been trying to\nget hold of for days. As you've\nprobably realised from the first\nsentence though, the weather\nwas complete pants. The Torch\nProcession was a soggy traipse up\nthe hill, watching people set trees\nand each other alight, then we all\nhuddled together in the name of\ncharity to watch the fireworks.\nHaving said that, they were good\nand our thanks go to the guys\nfrom 153 (Ben, Henry, Charmer\nand Adam) as well as Dave (!)\nand Mike (Hunt) West in the fore-ground, as well as all those little\npeople in the background. You\nknow who you are.\nMonday night was our Charity\nand Salve Auction (Muhahaha!!!).\nThe highlights had to be JT's chest waxing (we know it hurt\nreally), Charmer buying his battered old car back for \u00a31.5 million and the (lucky) slaves being\nauctioned for a bit of do sh. Good\ngoing guys.\nTuesday's Tug of War was\nrained off (I wasn't going out in\nthat if someone paid me), but we\nprobably wouldn't have made it\nanyway (well, I wouldn't have).\nThis is because of Tuesday morn-ing. Champagne Breakfast. What\na wonderful idea. Having been to\na car park for last year's, we did-n't have a lot to beat. But, none\nthe less, it was bloody brilliant. At\n6 in the morning, we were all\npiled on two coaches with no idea\nwhere we were off to. Turned out,\nwe were headed to a dry ski\nslope, so by 7o 'clock we were\nsledging down the p iste, champagne bottles in hands. The best\nhad to be the JSF (dressed as\nSantas for the week) going down\nbutts open, the Garters (dressed\nas Superwomen) flying down\ncape open or Fish going down in\nfull James Bond style e, legs\ncrossed, drinking champagne and\ncoming to a gentle stop at the\nbottom. Best injury for this week,\ngoes to Hettie who broke her toe\nand giggled the whole way to hospital in an Ambulance.\nAccompanying her was Adam\nHansen who attempted to slash\nhis wrists on the slope, but failed\ndue to our faithful First Aider in a luminous jacket (yes, Lee, that's you as he reads this over my\nshoulder). Special mentions have\nto go to Little Bex and Sarah for\norganising it and coming back to\npick up yours truly when the\ncoaches left me behind, also the\ncanteen ladies in Withersdane for\ndoing all the egg and bacon\ns arnie s which were lovely at that\ntime after a good bottle or two of\nc hampers. Tuesday night was Band Night\nand the Hog Roast, the remainder\nof which Andy (our Pres) was still\nmunching through at the end of\nthe week. The Band (Karl, Lucy\nLocket, Pauline and Yaz) were\nfabulous (as always) and it was a very well deserved, relaxing\nevening.\nWednesday evening saw the\ninfamous Canterbury Pub Crawl\nand, although I didn't go, I'm told\nit was a pretty boring one, so\nthere's not a lot to write about.\nExcept, Miranda Warren pulling a local p iki e and telling everyone he\nwas \"very intellectual\". The words\n\"beer\" and \"goggles\" come to\nmind. Oh well.\nThursday. Oh, Thursday. I would say it was the Druids disco,\nbut the Druids don't exist, as I'm constantly reminded, it was the\nMeterological Society Disco.\nBasically, an excuse for a group of\nn utters( I can say that as \"noone\nknows who they are\") to dress up\nin balaclava s, dirty lab coats and\nget absolutely wasted. A very\nmessy evening and very cold\n(speaks she who was shivering\nbehind the bar wearing 7 layers of\nclothing) but a damn good laugh\nand enjoyed by all. Well, most. I do have to mention one stupid\nsod that was given a glass of chilli\nvodka, drank it trying to be hard\nand then ended up throwing up\nand crying in a corner. Don't know\nwho that could be, eh Ned?\nFriday saw the first kidnapping\nof a lecturer, sorry, two lecturers.\nThey both seemed to enjoy it and\nI ought to thank the kidnappers.\nYou know who you are.\nFriday was also the Charity\nBall, this year with a1920's theme. As your illustrious author\nwas working again due to a desperate need for money, she didn't see many of the goings on.\nHowever, being a bit of a nosey\ncow, I find most things out any-way, although many of them I am\nunable to scrawl here out of pure\nsympathy and fear. We played\nhost to a group of strange Agrics\nfrom Reading who didn't understand the \"no more snakebite\"\nroutine. Once again, everyone\nwas out in their finest, and full\nrespect to the Garters and the\nBeaus, who were still in their\nweek old costumes at the ball.\nSaturday saw us being beaten\nby the Reading lot in a Rugby\nmatch and I was hoping to have a review of the match from one of\nthe lads, but, as you can tell, my\nhoping is to no avail, so they're\ngoing to have to put up with what\nI write. At the end of the match,\nwe (the intrepid supporters) reckon only two of our team weren't injured. Not a good tally. You\ncould almost sing \"Heads, shoulders, knees and toes\" to the team\nand get a response for each bit.\nConsidering the fact they all\nlimped off, I thought they battled\ndamn well, although the captain\n(Adam) will no doubt disagree\nwith me as he was out injured\nand jumping up and down like a lunatic on the touch line. Yes, they\nlost, but they turned out and gave\nit a shot. Well done fell as. At the end of the week, we'd had a good laugh, drunk loads\nand, most importantly raised\nshed loads of money for two good\ncauses. Thanks to all those who\nhelped out and I haven't men-tio ned, like Heena Patel, John the\nPorter, Emily Williams, and everyone else I 've missed off. Thanks\nguys.
