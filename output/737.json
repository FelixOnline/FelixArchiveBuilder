Result: yet more\nwastage of time and\nmoney.\nLack of cooperation\nleads inevitably to chaos.\nCarl Burgess has shown\nthat, no matter how\ncharismatic the union\npresident, attempting to\ndeal with college alone is\ndoomed to failure. And the\nCC Us seem currently to be\nno better, being orientated\ntowards people with\nparticular traditional views.\nProtestations about events\nnot having to involve\ndrinking seem to rather\nmiss the point. Certainly\nwould be reluctant to go to\nthe Union Bar for fear of\nfinding it full of tie club\nmembers and obnoxious\ndrunks.\nImperial College Union\nand its three const it ment unions have a great\npotential for truly involving\nthe vast majority of the\nstudents here. We have at\nleast avoided the situation\nin some of the arts ridden\nuniversities where people\nhave to be members of a small political clique in\norder to have a say in the\nunion. But there still seems\nto be a problem of terminal\nmass apathy.\nI had always thought that\npr t of union meeting\nevents organised in the first\nfew weeks of the year by\nthese people provide a vital\nway for new students to\nmix socially\u2014but by the\nmiddle of the second term\nthose attending C CU events are generally the\nhabitual inhabitants of the\nvarious union offices and\ntheir immediate friends.\nIt seems that very few\npeople in the union are\nprepared to take serious\naction on matters such as\nwelfare, challenging college\ndecisions or response to\ngovernment cuts. Why is it\nthat only places like\nDurham, with a letter\nwriting campaign aimed at\nstudents parents, or\nOxbridge, from where\ncoincidentally the vast\nmajority of national\npoliticians come, make\nnational headlines? Yet it\nseems that if some poor\nunfortunate should try to\nraise a faintly political point\nor critics e some tradition\n'ridden item such as\nmascot ry or rag, they will\nmeet a barrage of derision\nworthy of Militant at its\nmost fac is t The best claim to fame of\nthe unions this year is that\nthey have gained control of\na bar which was a liability\nto the college catering\noperation. Hopefully the\nlower floor of the union\nbuilding can now be\ndeveloped as a regular\nevening social centre. But\nMoore Lyttle has a difficult\ntask when many people in\nmy department, for one,\na science or engineering\nbased education ought to\nbe the best way to teach\npeople to think logically\nabout problems of all types.\nI thought I might find\npeople in a student union\nwho were interested in\nwhere the world is going.\nAlas I'm exposed as a hopeless dreamer because\nsuch people are few and far\nbetween. There are a vast\nnumber of students who\nshow far more concern\nabout where they are going\nout on their free evenings\nthan they would about, say,\na significant increase in the\nnumber of reported rapes\nin London. In many ways\nwho can blame them\nbecause they are simply\nconsidering their own\nimmediate problems in a world that becomes daily\nmore bewildering. Perhaps\nalso students are forced to\nbe rather more conservative\n(small c) in today's Britain\nwhere the promise of a secure future is not as\nsecure as it used to be. But\nthat seems to bring to mind\nthe argue ment about the\nreputation of your degree.\nI doubt whether there are\nun iver i sites where the\nproblem of apathy is\nstartlingly better than here.\nBut the handbooks and\nprospectuses portray\nImperial as a leader and a centre of excellence. Surely\nthe union ought to ensure\nit lives up to this image.\nHaving seen the turnout\nwhich elected Duncan\nRoyle as next year's Guilds\npresident and the success\nof Christine Taig I think\nthere is hope. But I also\nthink that it is time for the\nunion to take a strong\nobjective look at itself. It\nseems for example that\nthere are some ludicrous\ncases of competition where\nthere should be co-operation. There are three\nCC Us plus the IC Ents\nCommittee all organising\nevents largely separately\nfrom one another, and\napparently with little\naccountability. There are\nsome clubs and societies,\nparticularly departmental\nsocieties and less\n'glamourous' sports and\nsocial clubs who's activity\nis restricted by lack of\nfunds while some 'prestige'\nclubs and events attract\nlarge amounts of money\nrelative to the numbers of\npeople involved. Perhaps it\nis time for people like\nCC Us and IC ents to be\nmade more accountable for\ntheir spending.\nFurthermore executives\nshould be precisely what\ncan live up to my own\ncriteria. It seems there are\npeople wanting to revive\nthe issue of NUS\nmembership and I suspect\nthat this is a topic which\nwill see considerable\ndebate, I hope it won't be\njust the same old\ncharacters voicing their\nregular opinions. I think in\na lot of other areas the next\ntwelve months will also\nprove crucial to the long\nterm future of Imperial\nCollege Union. If we do not\nproduce proposals for\nchanges of our own accord\nthey will be forced on us.\nThe only way to achieve\nthis is for next years\nexecutive to consult as\nwidely as possible.\nAlthough it may be too late\nto get the best possible\nagreement over the future\nof the FELIX office there\nwill be other issues to\nfollow.\nThere is one final\nrequirement both for the\nunion and the college to\nhave a healthy long term\nfuture. That is that you\nAnother sort of union meeting\ntheir definition entails-ie\nthere to take care of day to\nday running and\nrepresentation-not\ndictatorships however\nbenign. It is not the job of\nunion presidents to make\npolicy alone, neither is it\ntheir job to reach\nagreements on matters of\nsignificant consequence\nwithout consultation. It was\nonce suggested to me that\nthe most important\nrequirement of a president\nwas that they should be 'a leader of men' but it is\nmuch more important, I believe, to have a person\nwho can inspire debate and\nlisten. The way to improve\nthe union is not through\ngi micky ideas and rhetoric\nbut through people elected\nto positions of\nresponsibility being\nprepared to listen to\nopinions other than their\nown.\nI hope next year as\nExternal Affairs officer I reading this should take an\ninterest and form and voice\nyour own opinions from\nwhat you see and not what\nyou are told. It is not\nimportant whether you\nagree or disagree with what\nI may say but whether you\nchallenge it. If you fail to\ntake an interest in\ninforming yourself about\nwhat is going on in the\nworld around you then you\nare doomed to be some\nsecond class technical\nnobody in whatever\norganisation you find\nyourself. If you are content\nto let things run as they will\nthen you deserve to be in a union that finds itself losing\nfunds and facilities, you\ndeserve second rate\nteaching, you deserve to\nend up forced to live on\nstudent loans and you\ndeserve when you leave to\nbe passed over in favour of\ngraduates from some\nprovincial university.\nFELIX Friday 25 April 11\n\n"

He warned that the\nRag Mag would attract\nsimilar bad publicity for\nImperial.\nMr Rose has been proved\nright. National newspapers\nhave carried articles that\ndone serious damage to\nImperial College's image. .\nTony Spencer, the Rag\nMag Editor, may think its\nfunny to be have his\npublication attacked in the\nnational press it may, as he\nhas suggested in the past\nincrease sales of the Rag\nMag to have it attacked in\nThe Daily Mirror: it won't increase applications to\nImperial; it won't improve\nour chances of getting a decent grant next year.\nApplications to Imperial\nCollege are dropping\ndramatically. If this trend\ncontinues the value placed\non your degree by industry\nwill be lowered. Publicity\nabout 'sick' Rag Mags will\nonly encourage parents to\nsend their sons and\ndaughters to 'nice'\nuniversities like Bath and\nExeter rather than 'sick'\nones like Imperial.\nNext year your grant is\nbeing cut in real terms\n(surprise, surprise). One of\nthe reasons the\nGovernment can\ncontinually cut grants is\nthat the public have a very\nlow opinion of students.\nTheir opinion will be lower\nwhen the read about the\nRag Mag.\nRag is an important part\nof student life. Events like\nRag Fete on Saturday allow\nstudents to enjoy\nthemselves and raise\nmoney for charity. The Rag\nMag is an important part of\nRag at Imperial College.\nRag Mags should appeal to\nthe student sense of\nhumour. They shouldn't attract bad publicity for the\nCollege. Rag Mags are\nprimarily mean't to raise\nmoney for charity. This Rag I Mag wouldn't have worse\nsales if the Bradford fire\njokes had been removed.\nUnion President Carl\nBurgess had the\nop pur t unity to remove the\nBradford jokes before the\nRag Mag was printed. I hope Christine Taig learns\nby Carl's mistakes.\nIran\nIn the letters page this\nweek you will notice\nseveral letters this week\nattacking opinion article\nabout Iran that FELIX\nprinted last term. I 'll leave\nyou to decide which side is\nright or wrong. I'd just like\nto defend the an on imo us writer of that article. In the\npast Iranian students who\nhave attacked the regime in\nIran have been beaten on\nthe campus of their British\nuniversity. The author of\nthat article wasn't keen to\nrisk being beaten up. They\nwere brave enough to trust\nme not reveal who they are,\nthough.

Perhaps Mr\nMartin refers to the\nintroduction of the\ncoloured and Indian houses\nof par li amant set up to\nadvise the white house on\nmatters relating to the\ncoloured and Indian\ncommunities; the election\nfor which had the support\nof less than 18% of the\nelectorate in each case.\nThe black community\nwhich accounts for just\nover 70% of the population\nstill had no say what s over in the government of South\nAfrica.Perhaps, instead, he\nmeant the repeal of the law\nbanning inter-social sex,\nwhich means that black\nand white South Africans\ncan now marry each other,\nalthough because of the\nGroup Areas Act, they are\nnot allowed to live in the\nsame part of town.\nEven'the proposed\nabolition of the pass laws,\nwhich prevent black South\nAfricans from being in any\npart of the country unless\nthey have a stamp to prove\nthey live or work there,\nrepresents little more than\na political sleigh t of hand.\nThe 'orderly urban s at ions' system which is due to\nreplace them will have as\nits only stipulation for\nurban right the condition\nthat an individual must\nhave accommodation. That\ncondition alone smacks of\nthe influx control which is\nsupposedly being\nabolished. Apartheid\ncannot be reformed,\nmodernised or streamlined;\nit needs to be completely\ndismantled.\nThe only reason that\napartheid has survived for\nso long is because of the\nmassive financial support\nfor South Africa from the\ninternational community.\nUnless this support is cut,\nthere will be no incentive\nfor the white community in\nSouth African to mend its\nways. Therefore the best\nway that we outside of the\ncountry can oppose\napartheid is to, as Mr\nMartin has suggested,\nrespect the views of Bishop\nDesmond Tutu and call for\nfull mandatory sanctions\nagainst South Africa. One\nof the largest British\ninvestors in South Africa\nover the years has been\nBarclays Bank, which via it\nSouth African subs i du aries has \u00a36 billion worth of\nassets in South Africa and\ncontrols 30% of the\nbanking there; hence the\nreason for the motion to\ndiscourage students from\nopening accounts with\nthem.\nBishop Tutu is not the\nonly prominent South\nAfrican church leader to\ncall for sanctions; Rev\nBeyers Naude, president of\nthe South African Council\nof Churches repeated the\ncall on national television\nonly last week\nCould Mr Martin please\ntell me which African\ncountries he says have,\nafter overthrowing\napartheid or foreign\ncolonial systems, became\nless representative and\nmore brutal? Could he\nname one which is the last\nyear detained over 20,000\npeople without trial for\nspeaking out against the\ng oven ment, or one in which\nover 1400 people according\nto government figures have\nlost their lives in the last 18\nmonths!\nI would like to ask one\nfinal question. If more of\nthe members of Con Soc\nwho had been asked to\ncome along to the U GM on\n13 March had done so, so\nthat they were in the\nmajority, and yet the\nmeeting was still clearly\nin quo rate, would the\nmeeting have been\nrepresentative enough for\nMr Martin not to have been\nprepared to challenge the\nquorum, or does\ndemocracy just work in one\ndirection?\nShaun Dunlop\nIC Anti-Apartheid Soc\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College\nUnion Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union\nPrint Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW72 BB,( Tel 01-589 5111\next 3515) The Editor of FELIX is Hugh Southey and The Business\nManager is J Martin Taylor.

In a field of over\ni400 British and European\nI crews, the first VIII came\neleventh, losing only to\nI international crews.\nThe second VIII came\nthird in the Senior B Category and 41st overall,\nThe Snenior C crews, put\ntogether on the day, came\n250th overall. The Novice\nI crew came seventh in their\nevent and 222nd overall.\nThe Fifth VIII racing in the\nElite class, came 72nd overall, despite starting one\nfrom last.\nThe first VIII were the\nhighest placed university or\ncollege crews, and the\nsecond VIII were the\nhighest university or\ncollege second crew. These\nresults show the excellent\ndepth of talent in the club\nand hopes are high for a successful regatta season.\nThe first VIII and fifth VIII\nwere racing in the 'Eric\nAsh', the boat purchased\nlast summer.\nBadminton\nImperial Beat UCL\nAn impressive victory saw a strong Imperial team beat\nUniversity College by 7:2\nafter UC had conceded the\nfinal rubber.\nThe first game on was\nmixed and Sean and Sarah\nhad a tough time beat nga UC pair boasting a national\nplayer, In fact Imperial lost\nthe rubber having won a fast and furious first game.\nSean staggered off,\nabsolutely knacker ed, and\nblamed their demise on a piece of mince pie he'd scoffed earlier and Sarah's addiction to wispa bars.\nFirst blood thus went to\nUC but they had to wait\nuntil the mens singles.\nWhen Tan narrowly lost to\nthe-above UC players for\ntheir second and final\npoint.\nSuper star Robin had a couple of easy matches.\nFirst in the singles and then\nin the ladies doubles\nwhere, partnered by our\nin tre pio(?) captain, Susan,\nshe overwhelmed a potentially strong UC pair.\nIn her excitement Susan\npromptly scoffed half a packet of biscuits before\ngoing on court with Helen\nfor the last ladies doubles.\nAfter a good start (Helen\nwon the knock-up) the IC '\npair soon got confused ano\nit ended up with Helen\nrunning in circles round\nSusan and Susan running\nround herself.\nMeanwhile, back in the\nmixed doubles, Sarah had\njust made a meal of the\nremaining biscuits and\nSean was making a meal of\nthe match. Again the\nrubber was decided over 5\ngames but the IC pair came\nout on top after an easy\nlast game. Sarah promptly\nleft to go flying and Sean\nwas left to crawl off court.\nIn the mens doubles Tan\nand Bahret had little\nproblems winning both\ntheir matches. A usual Tan\nlooked half asleep, a casually prancing around\nthe court leaving all\ndifficult shots to Barket.\nInfact Bharet gave an\nimpressive display on how\nto cover the court without\nactually returning a shuttle.\nIn the other mens match\nBia Dave Heaps got\nlumbered with Sean who\nhad decided he ws a going\nto stand at the net and get\nthe 'd rib bly ones'. Dave was\nleft to do all the running\nand his fanatical\nscreaming, though\ndisturbing the opposition, it\nkept his partner awake.\nNeedless to say, Sean was\ncarried off after yet another\n3 game rubber\nFootball\nTour Defeats\nZu i lichen Rotterdam 1\nImperial College 0\nHaving suffered a nigh mare crossing and the inevitable\nlengthy delay at Customs\nthat seems to afflict all\nBritish teams in Europe,\nIC's sporting ambassadors\nfaced a tough assignment\nagainst the crack Rottedam\noutfit.

The young FIFA\nofficial was given the\nDutchmen more protection\nthat in the Mafia, and\nsuspicious that his\ninterpretation of physical\ncontact was more Netball\nthan Football were\nconfirmed when Barvery\nwas cautioned for a copy book slide-tackle.\nOn 20 minutes, Van der\nSlappkopf, the balding\nDutch schemer, unleashed\na vicious shot which moved\nso many ways it could have\nknitted a jumper before\nWhitehead une as i yl pushed\nit round the post. This\nscare seemed to inspire a Dunkirk type spirit from IC\nand they soon began to\ntake control on a soggy,\nbeach-like pitch.

Mr George\nGallagher Daggitt of the\nMinistry of Defence has\n;sent letters to the Vice\nChancellors of every British\nUniversity. In the letter he\nstated that 'adequate\nprovisions' had been made\n'for the protection of British\n'intellectual property rights.\nThe funding for research,\nhe said would come from\nthe Americans Innovative\nScience of Technology\nprogramme, which has a budget of 2.7$billion.\nSeventeen areas of\nresearch have been listed\nas being applicable to SDI.\nA number of items\nincluding composite\nmaterials, parallel high\nspeed computers, and\nlasers are relevant to\nImperial. Applications will\nbe handled though the\nresearch contracts office,\nwhich will sc rut in is e any\ncontracts made\u2014'no\ncontracts have been\naccepted yet' said Mr\nLobbette from the Research\nContracts Office, 'although\nseveral people have\nexpressed interest'. The\ndeadline for applications is\nMay 3rd. The Pro-Rector Dr\nPhelps was anxious to allay\nfears that the publication of\nresearch work would be\nrestricted by classification.\n'There is no way that\ncollege will sign anything\nwith classification clauses'\nhe said. He said that\nImperial, would be a 'premier leader in the\ncompetition' and could\nhope to gain 'an upper\ntarget of $20 million' from\nStar Wars research.\nMr Gallagher-Daggit told\nFELIX that work on the\nInnovative Science and\nTechnology program would\nnot be classified. He said\nthat assurance to this effect\nhad been made in congress\nby General Yonas the\nDeputy Director of the SDI\norganisation. He refused to\nelaborate on the details of\nwhat Mr Yonas said as the\ndetails were apparently\nclassified.\n'Any authority which\nawards grants from Science\nand Engineering research\nplaces an obligation on\nresearchers to publish\nresults', said Mr Gallagher\nDaggitt.\nHe was unable to say\nhow much money British\nUniversities would receive\nbut warned 'any ideas that\nthere will be millions of\npounds coming over are\ncrazy'. He went on to say\nthat Britain would face\nstrong competition from\nthe USA, Germany, France\nand Israel.\nA source in the American\nEmbassy told FELIX that\nthe financial rewards for\nUniversities were likely to\nbe small during the first\nyears. He said that\n'upwards of 10 or 12'\ncontracts were under\nnegotiation including one\nuniversity, Heriott-Watt (for\ntheir work on optical\ncomputers). He felt the\nclassification would occur\non a case by case basis in\nboth industry of\nuniversities.

It is\nrumoured that there will be\nshocks for some\nuniversities which have\nbeen well-funded in the\nJvpast.\nThe changes are the\nresult of a report to the\nUGC by management\nconsultant Roger McCure,\nwho received the plans of\nall British Universities with\nthe help of UGC Staff. Mr\nMcCure concluded that the\nuniversity system is near to\ncollapse, with several\ninstitutions facing\ninsolvency. Although\nincome could be increased\nby recruiting more overseas\nstudents and attracting\nmore research money, he\nwas concerned that this\nwould not make a significant difference. All\nUniversities compete for\nthe same pool of overseas\nstudents, and research\ngrants are determined by\nthe Government. However,\nthe report recognised the\ndiffering plans of each\nuniversity, some of which\nhad taken the worse\npossible choices.\nThe UGC hopes that\nsome institutions will be\ncapable of support, but\nthey will have to decide\nwhether to continue\nfunding particular\nuniversities on their costs.\nOnly 17% of students\nwould vote Conservative in\nan immediate General\nElection according to a Marplan pole for NUS. This\nis compared with a claimed\nstudent vote for the\nConservatives of 42% in the\n1983 General Election. The\nsurvey gave Labour the\nI lead with 35%.

    "content": "O Intelligent Robots?\nAn opinion article by ex-Guildsheet editor Mark\nCottle.\nTowards the end of last term I was involved in the\nproduction of a spoof Guildsheet which had been\nintended to satirize various aspects of student unions at\nImperial College. Some people were offended by some of\nthe contents, I was offended by bits of it myself.\nNevertheless I had become so disillusioned in my time\nat college that I felt something needed to be done to\nshock people with the sort of hypo c is y which goes on. At\nthe time it was rather difficult to write a serious criticism\nopenly, but it's no good pouring out derision without\ntrying to say something positive as well. I 've been an\nactive supporter of things like CC Us and Rag in the past\nand so maybe its slightly hypocritical for me to write some\nof the following. But looking around me I see the same old\nfaces having their say.\nThe word 'hack' is normally used to mean anyone who\nis involved with an organisation (often newspapers) at a basic level, but at Imperial it seems to be an insult. I asked\nmyself why this is so. Why don't the vast majority of\nstudents seem to care. Why is it that obnoxious extroverts\nso often end up running things? Why in an institution that\nis supposed to have such a formidable academic record, is\nit, that the usual method for showing discontent with your\ncourse is to talk loudly in lectures, lob paper darts or go\nto sleep? Seeing as FELIX is open for anybody to air their\nopinions and at the risk of being considered an obnoxious\nextrovert I decided to have my say.\nmore space, and you get a set of reasons why\napplicants with good 'A' levels are beginning to go\nelsewhere. In fact whereas\nlast year for science and\nengineering as a whole\nthroughout the country\nUCC A applications fell by\nSometime earlier this\nyear during a discussion on\nteaching at College the\nsuggestion was made to me\nthat \"IC produces very\ngood technicians but poor\nscientists\" Now as a( supposed) engineer I'm not really qualified to talk\nabout teaching on Science\ncourses, but it seemed that\nthe point of the comment\nwas that while Imperial\nproduces people with a high standard of\ncompetence in the basic\ndisciplines of their subject\nit fails to teach them to\nthink for themselves. The\nconcensus seemed to be\nthat we are at an institution\nwhich has taken to heart its\nbrief to produce\ntechnological graduates for\nindustry at the expense of\nteaching you to ever\nchallenge what you are\ntold- to ever be anything\nbut apathetic about the\nworld beyond your own\nimmediate life. When I came to Imperial I did so\nbecause certain points had\nbeen made to me by\nprospectuses and staff. I now find that I'm not the\nonly one to be d is ll usi one d by the reality behind some\nof these expectations.\nTeaching methods and\nstandards are one area\nwhere a lot has already\nbeen said but little has yet\nbeen done. A college\nworking party on schools\nMason noted last May that\n\"There is evidence that IC\nhas a bad reputation in\nundergraduate teaching\".\nYet only recently has the\nUnion been seen to take\nany sort of coordinated\ninterest in academic affairs.\nIn fact many well\nintention ed committees\nseem to have acted, as Pete\nKlemperer suggested,\nmerely to keep student\ndiscontent quiet. It needs\nabout 3%, applications to\nIC fell by 8%. More than\nthat, according to the\nCollege Admissions Policy\nCommittee, the College\nScholarship exam, an\nindicator of high potential\nstudents, will probably not\nbe run in future due to a lack of candidates.\nImperial depends on a more than motions at\nin quo rate UGMs to have\nmuch influence when\ncollege policy appears to\nbe dominated by\neconomics and orientated\ntowards industrial research.\nThen there is the\nquestion of the ratio of\nsexes which, to judge by\nthe pages of FELIX, is\ntreated in some quarters\nwith far less than the\nseriousness it deserves.\nAdd to this the worsening\nproblems of\naccommodation, the ability\nof many universities\noutside London to offer\nmore modern facilities and\nhighly qualified and highly\nmotivated intake to\nproduce high quality\ngraduates\u2014it, would have\nto given the limitations of\nits teaching! Ultimately if\nthe standard of applications\nto IC is seen to fall so will\nits reputation and the\nreputation of your degree.\nThere are staff who are\nconcerned about student\nproblems, the new rector,\nfor one, seems keen to\nimprove matters. But the\nunions seem to consistently\nlet their members down.\nStudent unions will always\nhave certain inherent\nproblems. The officers will\nalways be amateurs in\ncomparison to the\nprofessional administrators\nthey may deal with. There\nwill always be a lack of\ncontinuity as officers\nchange each year, those\njust taking over will take a large part of their term of\noffice to become\nexperienced. Quite often if\ncollege get an unfavourable\nresponse from one set of\nofficers all they need to do\nis wait for the next set.\nAgainst this Imperial has\nhad certain strengths,\nsignificantly national party\npolitics and all its inherent\npola rising of debate has\ntaken a back seat in union\nbusiness. But in striving to\nmaintain a 'vehemently\nmoderate' image\nanachronisms have arisen.\nIn fact in many respects the\nstudent unions at Imperial\nare an extremist farce. It is\nmy personal disillusion with\nsome of the people\nresponsible for\nrepresenting students and\nthe failure (largely) of the\nunion to contain their\nincompetence or self\ninterest that has really led\nme to write this.\nThe union is currently\nfacing problems of limited\nmoney and demands on\nspace. This is not a sudden\nproblem it is a crisis which\nhas been brewing slowly\nfor years. The plan for\nexcavating gravel at\nHarlington was uncovered\nat least three years ago, the\nneed for the Life Science\ndepartment to find more\nspace is not something\nwhich suddenly happened\nhalfway through this year.\nYet has the union had any\ncoherent reply to college\nplans? It hasn't even\nmanaged to make the full\nfacts of the proposals\nknown. This year's chairman of the Athletics\nClubs Committee was given\nvirtually no information at\nall about the way the\nHarlington gravel\ndevelopment will affect the\nnumber of pitches\ndestroyed and he is\nprobably the guy whose\nbusiness it is most of all.\nThen there is the old\nchestnut of C CU finance\nand how justifiable some of\nthe spending is. From the\nmir ky depths of some\ncompromising brain came\nphrases like 'integral but\nautonomous' which mean\n'you have to give us money\nbut we can spend it how\nwe like'. The point of this is\nto show what happens\nwhen an organisation is run\nby lots of people who all\nwant to be in\ncharge\u2014everyone ends up\nlooking after their own\n10 Friday 25 April FELIX\n\n"

In\ndramatic fashion Whitehead\nand the Dutch Keeper\nreturned to the pitch, only\nfor IC partly and partially\npissed penal t ly King to\nplace his shot wide. The\nBritish Bulldog was not the\nonly can didi ate for\ncastration that evening!\nOlympia Rotterdam5 Imperial College 3\nAs the British media har led their anger at the Zuilichem\ndefeat, attacking the\napparent carefree attitude\nand slack discipline of the\nIC tourists, the captaincy\nwas taken away from the\nlaid back Lunghi, and for\nthis final game was given to\nthe more belligerent\nBravery.\nHowever, a heavily-sanded artificial surface,\nwhich resembled, in parts,\nthe glassy remains of a road accident, as well as\nmaking IC realise that the\nslide tackle ban was not\nsuch a bad idea after all,\nalso meant that controlled\nfootball was impossible. A ridiculously light ball\nbobbled, bounced and\nballooned all over the\nplace, the tackles were as\nartificial as the pitch, and\nwithin half an hour, the\npan to mine had reached 3-3, Lunghi, Lynne and\nRhodes netting for the\nvisitors.\nAmid an unreal, almost\nfarcical atmosphere,\nBravery's travelling Circus\nplunged to new but\nentertaining depths, and\nkeeper Whitehead thrilled\nan open-jawed crowd with\na sensational fifty-yard\ndribble up the touch line. The confident Olympia\noutfit, perhaps sensing the\nunusual lack of British grit,\non such a gritty pitch,\nproceeded to tear IC apart\nin the second period with\nsome marvellously skilful\nball controls and flick inter-passing. Baffled, bemused\nand bewildered, old pros\nlike Goldsworthy, arrow,\nand Barnes were given a harsh footballing lesson,\nand it was more through\nluck than judgement,\nincluding a missed penalty,\nwhich kept the score down\nto 5-3 in favour of the home\nteam.\nNevertheless, that\nevening as reporters arrived\nat the IC hotel for the after\nmatch inquest, it was clear\nthat many of the squad,\nbusy with hair dryers, deodorants, and clean\nsocks, were far more\nconcerned with feasting\ntheir eyes on foreign\nfrau le in s than fretting over\nfailed football fixtures.\nAs the team returns\nhome after such poor\nresults, surely it is time for\nus to consider appointing a tough Ron Saunders type\nsupremo, to prevent our\nsportsmen treating future,\ntours as an excuse for\nholiday fun and frolics.\nf%\\ \u2022\nheat re Don't forget the Dramatic\nSociety Auditions for our\nshows at the Edinburgh\nFringe Festival in August.\nThis year we are\nperforming three plays: The\nRhyme of the Ancient\nMariner, by Samuel\nColeridge-Taylor, the\nWoman in White by William\nWilkie Collins and the\nLucky Ones, By Neil\nMarchant.\nThe auditions take place\non Friday 25th April at\n7.00pm and on Sunday at\n2.00pm.

    "content": "Size Isn't Everything\nThe size of human testicles\nmay be more important than\nwas previously thought.\nRecent studies have shown\nthat there may be a relationship between racial\nvariations in testicle size and\nthe incidence of dizygotic or\nfraternal twins (which develop\nwhen two ova are fertilised at\nthe same time).\nMeasuring testicle size is\ndifficult in living specimens,\nand results aren't very reliable;\nthe weight at death is a more\naccurate measure. The large\ndifferences found are rather\nsurprising: Caucasians have\nmuch bigger testicles than\nAsians, and the difference is\nquite out of proportion to the\nLeft\nTesticle\nHong Kong Chinese 7.98g Danes 20.40g Right\nTesticle\n8.57g>21.60g differences in body size.\nIn apes, large testicle size\ncorrelates with high\ncopula tory frequency and nigh\nprobability that a female wMi\nmate with several males\nduring one ov ul a tory cycle.\nBut the same does not apply\nto humans.\nThe variation in the\nincidence of fraternal twins\nfollows the same direction as\nthe variation in testicle size. In\nJapan, for instance, about 2\nbirths per thousand result in\nfraternal twins. In Caucasians\nthe figure is more than 8 per\nthousand, and in the Yoruba\ntribe in lle sha it is nearly 50\nper thousand. The testicle size\nfor Yorubas is not recorded.\nBut so-called causal links\nlike this need to be treated\nwith caution. It has been\nshown that the concentration\nof sulphur dioxide in the\natmosphere is directly\nproportional to the rate of\nillegitimacy...\nThe Week In Science\nA new feature that looks at what's been happening in Science.\nEmbryo Auction\nThe first international embryo\nauction was held in Sydney,\nAustralia this month, with 89\nembryos auctioned in 51 lots\nby video links throughout\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nGCHQ Lies\nThe government has\nannounced that as a security\nmeasure it is going to\nintroduce polygraph lie-detector equipment at the\ngovernment spy station,\nGCHQ Cheltenham. The\nBritish Psychological Society\n(BPS) has warned its members\nthat if they operate the\nequipment they will lay\nthemselves open to\ndisciplinary action.\nResearch by American\nscientists, published in The\nLancet last month, reported\nthat the use of the lie detector\nThe safe raised A$304,750. Apart from their use in\nresearch, the attraction of\nembryos over the newly born\nis that they are much easier to\ntransport from Australia to\nNew Zealand.\n(All the lots were cattle\nembryos).\nwas based on a very weak\nscientific foundation . The\npolygraph is more likely to\nincriminate truthful people\nthan liars, and is unlikely to\nhelp prove a person's innocence, they say.\nThe polygraph was invented\nby Sir James Mackenzie, a London heart specialist who\ndied in 1925. The device\nsimultaneously records pulses\nin various veins and arteries,\nand so identifies disturbances\nin the heart beat. Mackenzie\ndesigned it for use in\ninvestigating heart disease,\nbut it was soon replaced by\nthe electrocardiograph for that\npurpose.\nTo Drink their answers.\nCould the piss artist jn the\nUnion Bar really be more\nartistic than the rest of us?\nProbably not, but many\ncreative genii have also been\ndrunkards. Take for instance,\nDylan Thomas, Brendan\nBehan, WC Fields and\nSibelius. All were creative\npeople. And all drank\nthemselves to death. There are\nmany more examples.\nNow there is some scientific\nwork going on to try to\nestablish a connection. Geoff\nLowe, of Hull University, took\n16 men and 16 women aged\n18-30. Each subject came in to\nthe laboratory on two\noccasions a week apart. At\none visit they were given\nalcohol and on the other\noccasion a control nonalcoholic drink made to taste\nthe same. The subjects has no\nway of knowing what they\nwere drinking. On both\noccasions they had to\ncomplete a creativity test after\ntheir drink. Typical questions\nwere 'How many uses can you\nthink of for a cardboard box?'\nand'What if clouds had long\nstrings attached to them,\nhanging down to earth?'\nThe results do not show a direct correlation between\nalcohol consumption and\ncreativity. What they do show\nis that those who did very well\nwhen sober did worse when\ndrunk, and those who did\nbadly when sober did a bit\nbetter when drunk.\nLowe believes that the\nreason may be as follows: the\nlow scorers were stressful and\nanxious when sober, and\nalcohol made them relax a bit;\nthe high scorers were\nperforming at their peak when\nsober and alcohol numbed\nOr Not To Drink\nMore than 20 people are dead,\nand 50 are blind, after drinking\nItalian wine laced with\nmethanol. Nine winemakers\nare in prison charged with\nmurder, and four wineries\nhave been closed down.\nMethanol (CH3 OH) is related\nto ordinary alcohol, ethanol\n( CH3C H2OH), but it is very\nmuch more toxic.\nAbout 100ml of methanol is\nsufficient to kill, and 30ml can\ncause permanent blindness.\nThe contaminated cheap red\nItalian wine has sometimes\ncontained as much as 170ml methanol per litre bottle,\neasily a lethal dose.\nWhat is confusing experts is\nwhy anyone would add such a toxic substance to wine. The\nanswer probably lies in the\nway in which cheap Italian\nwines are priced. The value of\nsuch wines depends on the\nalcohol content, which is\ndetermined by measuring\nspecific gravity or density.\nMethanol (density 0.7915g/l) artificially lowers the density\nand so increases the value\nwhen sold to distributors.\nOne immediate effect of the\nscandal has been to reduce\nItaly's wine exports to almost\nnothing. Which is quite\nserious for a country where\nexports earn about \u00a3625\nmillion a year in foreign\ncurrency.\nTogether with the lethal\nnature of methanol, this makes\nthe problem much graver than\nthe Austrian scandal last year,\nwhen di ethylene glycol was\nfound in wine. (Diethylene\nglycol is not antifreeze, by the\nway. Antifreeze is mainly\nethylene glycol.)\nLess Than Likely\nProbabilities have to be\npositive, don't they? The\nlikelihood of 'tails' is roughly\n0.5, and the likelihood of\n'heads' is also roughly 0.5 and\nif you add'them together you\nget exactly 1; which is the\nprobability of getting an\noutcome at all. The idea of a negative probability would\nseem to be outside everyday\nhuman experience. Things are\neither certain (1), impossible\n(0), or more usually\nsomewhere in between.\nBut negative probabilities do\nseem to keep cropping up. In\nquantum mechanics, for\ninstance, relativistic\ngeneralisations of classical\nquantum theory often yield\nnegative energies, and with\nthem, functions that can be\ninterpreted as being\nprobability distributions that\nare capable of being negative.\nIn attempting to give some\nmeaning to negative\npro bab lit y, Professor MS Bartlett, formerly of\nManchester University,\nsuggests the following\napproach. If a coin is biased,\nthen the pro bab lit y of tossing\n'heads' can be expressed as\n0.5+x. Clearly x can be\npositive or negative,\ndepending on which way the\ncoin is biased. So here we\nhave a probability term that\ncan take a negative value.\nAnd now for our\ncom petit on. Bartlett believes\nthat most of the problems\nposed by negative probability\nstem from people's rash\ndetermination to follow Born\nin treating the square of the\nwave function as a probability\ndistribution. Bartlett sees no\nphysical justification for this\nassumption. The best\njustification submitted by a reader (less than 300 words\nplease) will be published next\nweek.

    "content": "More rag\nmag damage\nAnger was expressed in the\nNational Press last week at this\nyear's Rag Mag following a longer article published in a local Bradford paper.

Mr\nRenshaw described the\nBradford fire jokes as 'grossly\noffensive' and expressed his\nbelief that 'Students in Bradford\nwant to disown themselves from\nthis publication and it's sick\njokes'.\nAs well as press coverage, IC\nUnion have received four letters\nof complaint concerning the\nracist and sexist nature of some\njokes. Professor Ash told FELIX\nthat he shares these feelings\nand said that he thought the\nRag Mag was pathetic and that\nthe 'overwhelming majority of\n(IC) students must resent it'. He\nalso felt that the Rag Mag and\nthe subsequent publicity it\nreceived would dissuade girls\nfr or n applying to IC, and\nparents from allowing them to.\nAs yet, all complaints have been\nreceived from women.\nWhen asked to defend his\nposition, Rag Mag Editor Tony\nSpencer told FELIX that not\nonly had his Rag Mag made a profit for the first time in recent\nyears but that they sold more\nmagazines to Bradford students\nthan anyone else.\nSome of the money raised\nfrom the sale of the magazine\nwill be donated to the Bradford\nCity Disaster Appeal.\nMore cuts are\non the cards\nImperial College Union is\nsupporting a campaign being\nrun by the University of London\nUnion (ULU) which aims to\nblock the current Government\nproposals to cut student\nbenefits.\nULU has devised the\ncampaign in conjunction with\n'Camden Action On Benefits.'\n10,000 protest postcards have\nbeen printed, and distributed to\nconstituent colleges within the\nUniversity ,one of which is\nImperial, for students to\ncomplete. They will be delivered\nto the House of Commons in\nmid-May. The proposals are\ncurrently being studied by a government committee and will\ncost students at Imperial at\nleast \u00a3200 per year. The\nGovernment claims that the\n'simplifications' of the method\nused to calculate benefits are\nnot cuts but merely ways of\nmaking savings on\nadministrative costs. However\nthe local authorities, who\nadminister the systems on\nbehalf of the Government,\ncannot give figures on exactly\nhow much will be saved.\nThe cards are currently in the\nIC Union Office, and anyone\nwho wants may complete one to\nregister their opposition.\nMystery intruder found in Southside Following an alert to Southside\nSecurity over Easter that\nsomeone was living rough\nsomewhere in the building a man was found sleeping in the\nladies lavatory on the\npenthouse level.

It is now believed\nhowever that the name he gave\nis false and that he is in fact a failed MSc student attempting\nto avoid being forced to return\nto Iran where he would be\nforced to fight in the war there.\nWhen questioned he admitted\nto stealing food from fridges. It\nis not known whether this\nincidence can be linked to the\ntheft of mail in Falmouth-Keogh\nover Christmas.

The income from\nthese schemes is essential\nif reasonable rents in the\nresidences are to be\nmaintained. The various\nSummer Letting Schemes\noffer a number of jobs for\nthe vacation period. These\nvary from challenging full-time managerial posts to\npart-time cleaning work. In\ngeneral the work is well\npaid and interesting and\nfree accommodation is\nprovided.\nThe scheme falls into two\ndistinct categories. The\nSAC Schemes operates in\nLinstead Hall and part of\nSouthside and provides a standard hotel bed and\nbreakfast service catering\nfor conferences and other\nshort stay visitors. This is\nrun under the auspices of\nthe Conference Office. The\nother categories includes\nEvelyn Gardens, Hamlet\nGardens and Beit Hall and\nprovides a more basic and\nless expensive form of\naccommodation where the\nclients tend to be students\nfrom other colleges staying\nfor fairly long periods.\nThese schemes are run by\nStudent Services. For all\nthe schemes, marketing is\ncarried out centrally but\nduring the actual period\nmost of the work of\nrunning and maintaining\nthe schemes is carried out\nby students.\nThe Schemes\nSAC This is the most prestigious\nof the four schemes and\nrequires a large work force\nnecessary to maintain high\nstandards. The office and\nreception desk is based in\nthe foyer of Linstead Hall\nand is run by a member of\nthe Conference Office staff\ntogether with Assistant\nManagers, Night Managers,\nCashiers and Receptionists.\nThe reception desk is\nman ed day and night\nthroughout the Summer\nvacation. Guests are\nwelcomed, registered and\nbilled on arrival by the\nreception team and shown\nto their rooms by a porter.\nBehind the scenes, the\ncleaner prepares up to 400\nrooms which involves\nchanging and making beds,\ncleaning wash basins and\nbathroom and vacuuming\ncarpets. All this has to be\ndone in the morning in four\nhours. Cleaners work in\npairs, under the supervision\nof the Housekeeper and a co-or d in at or, servicing 24\nrooms and three sets of\nbathroom facilities on a star i case. Evelyn Gardens\nThis is the largest of the\nthree schemes operated by\nStudent Services, with up\nto 400 guests at anyone\ntime. All three schemes are\nrun by assistant managers\nunder the supervision of a co-or d in at or. The Evelyn\nGardens schemes is staffed\nby four assistant managers\nand eight cleaners. The\nassistant managers run an\noffice, act as receptionists,\nmaintain booking charts,\ncollect rent, operate the\nacc outing system and\nsupervise the cleaners. The\ncleaners clean rooms,\nchange sheets and act as\nporters.\nHamlet Gardens\nAt Hamlet Gardens three\nassistant managers run 39\nflats which provide\naccommodation for around\n250 guests. There are three\nmanagers and two cleaners\nwith full time duties similar\nto those of Evelyn Gardens\nmanagers. Many of the flats\nare organised so as to\nprovide fairly basic\na com mod ation but a number of the best flats are\nlet fully equip ted to families\nat a higher rent.\nBeit Hall\nBeit Hall is somewhat\ndifferent from the other\nschemes in a number of\nways. In the first place it is\nmuch smaller with only 110\nrooms. Also, the\nhousekeeper of Beit Hall is\nheavily involved with the\nVacation Lettings and the\nSAC office provides the\nreception facilities for the\nBeit Schemes. As a result\nof these factors we only\nneed one assistant\nmanager and two cleaners\nfor Beit. The assistant\nmanager is responsible for\nraising all invoices, making\nsure that guest pay on time\nand also co-ordinating with\nthe housekeeper\nAll students who work in the Summer Jetting schemes are offered free accommodation and\na competitive wage. Those who work for the whole Summer, are e lig ile for a bonus.\nWages, hours and bonus rates are as follows\nPosition\nAssistant Managers\nNight Managers\nReceptionist/cashiers\nCleaners and\nCo-or dina tors Porters\nHours/week\n39(average)\n33(average)\n35(average\n24\n14\nWages\n\u00a390pw \u00a374pw \u00a369\n\u00a31.90/hr\n\u00a31.90\nBonus\n\u00a3100-\u00a3300\n\u00a3100-\u00a3300\n\u00a370-\u00a3200\n\u00a330-\u00a3100\n\u00a330-\u00a3100\nCo-or dina tors receive a \u00a310\nper week responsibility\npayment in addition to the\nabove rate. The hours given\nfor co-or dina tors, cleaners\nand porters represent a guaranteed minimum; it is\nanticipated that additional\nhours will be available for\nthose who require them.\nThe hours given for other\nstaff represent normal\nhours but there will be time\nwhen extra hours are\nrequired. Although\novertime is not paid for\n14 Friday 25 April\nthese, extra hours will be\ntaken into account when\nassessing bonuses.\nThe Summer Lettings\nschemes offer an inter sting and generally rewarding\nkind of vacation work. At\ntimes the work is very hard,\nparticularly at the\nbeginning and end of the\nschemes. Those working\nthe management type jobs\nneed a lot of stamina and\npatience to deal with large\nnumbers of guests while\nworking under considerable\npressure. At the same time,\nmost people who work on\nthe scheme tend to enjoy\nthemselves as well as\ngaining useful work\nexperience.\nApplication forms and\nthe answers to any\nquestions you may have\nare available from student\nServices, 15 Princes\nGardens.\nClosing date Monday\n12th May.\nFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Islam\nDear Sir,\nWe would like to clarify\nsome points about ISLAM\nand the ISLAMIC revolution\nin Iran. The Islamic\nRevolution in Iran was not\nsimply a change in a regime and cutting the\nhands of both superpowers\nfrom the fate of a nation,\nbut it was a turning point in\nthe recent history of the\noppressed people of the\nworld. By ex cerci sing Islam, this revolution has lit\nup a luminous torch\nbeyond the path of each\nmovement, aiming to\nache ive liberty, greatness,\nhonour and dignity for\nhuman beings.\nThe oppressed people of\nthe world who have\nrealised the true nature of\nthe so called Eastern\nsocialistic and Western\ndemocratic or nationalistic\nman-made idea logie s, are\nnow practising Islam\nsuccessfully in sorting out\ntheir problems. Islam has\noffered them all the values\nwhich other idea logie s had\nfailed to provide.\nOne of the major social\nand political values offered\nby the comprehensive\nIslamic program to promote\nhuman beings is the\nmobil is ation of the masses\nto take their own right and\ncut the hands of\naggressors. In Islam, in the\nprocess of an oppression,\nthe passive oppressed\nperson is blamed as much\nas the oppressor.\nRevival of these aspects\nof Islam by Islamic\nRevolution in Iran is not\ntolerated by any of the\nplundering superpowers\nand their puppets. This\nexplains the unified, coordinated and mutually\nagreed conspiracies of both\nsuperpowers against Islam\nby attacking Iran in all\naspects and by all available\nmeans in spite of all their\nfundamental differences.\nDirecting, sponsoring and\nsupporting an unequal\nimposed war and wave of\nmurders of about 20,000\nIranian people from the top\nranks in government to\nordinary people by blind\nterrorist ic action of their\nmercenaries, economical\nsanctions and freezing\nmost of the external Iranian\nassets and an effective and\nprogrammed propaganda\nscheme against Iran are\nparts of the superpowers\ncampaigns to abort or at\nleast stop the widespread\nIslamic movements of\nabout one billion moslems.\nIn this huge evil\ncampaign the articles\nsimilar to the one published\nin the FELIX no 736 are so\nworthless and indignant to\nbe referred to.\nIn spite of all\nconspiracies made by\nsuperpowers and killing of\ntheir puppets and\nmercenaries the message\nof the Islamic Revolution\nhas been received by their\nconsciences of the\noppressed people of the\nworld and it will not be too\nlong that its flames burn\nthe roots of oppression and\ninjustice all over the world.\n'Some members of the IC\nIslamic Society'\nIran\nDear Sir,\nI did not really think FELIX\ncould also became a propaganda mouth. In your\nlast issue, (Wed 19.3.86), in\nthe Opinion column,\nsomeone, who did not even\nhave the courage to sign\nhis/her name, managed to\npour out some of the most\nincoherent rubbish that I have read the western\npress about Iran. It was\nalso childish and cowardly\nto publish such one-sided\n'opinion' in the last issue of\nterm, so as to delay the\nopportunity of an\nimmediate response.\nTo answer each and\nevery one of those fatuous\nremarks needs a book and I hope somebody throws\nsome light on the other\nside of the story in a similar\nopinion column. Let me\njust say that seven years\nago, the people in Iran\nmanaged to overthrow one\nof the mightiest dictators of\nour time, the Shah. In\ndoing this, they received\nprecious little help or\nen coura g ment from the rest\nof the world. They learnt\nhow sacrifice alone could\nbring about concrete\nresults, and they paid with\ntheir blood in order to\nestablish a government of\ntheir own-a rule that\nbrought their culture and\nvalues in to practice since\nthe capitalist and socialist\ndoctrines had failed to\nprovide an acceptable\npolitical solution, they\nwished to give their own\nidea logy l slam a chance.\nThey did so by an over\nw hel ming majority in a referendum. But from the\ntime of the 'crusaders'.\nIslam has always had a bad\npublicity in the west. Hence\nthe government in Iran is\nalways presented in the\n'dark ages' mentality, which\nIranian women in pur dah is in fact a reflection of the\nsubjective attitude of the\nwestern media. If a whole\nnation has decided to\npractice Islam, who then\nare westerners to pass a judgement? If they want to\nfight with immorality in\ntheir society, what right\ndoes the western man have\nto criticise them, given the\nconditons of his own\nsociety?\nIn any case, if the people\nin Iran felt any type of\nrenewed oppression, there\nis nothing to stop them\nrevolting again. After all\nthey defeated a mighty\ndictator, and his brutal\nsecret police seven years\nago, single-handed. This\ntime they would even get\nthe combined support of\nthe CIA and KGB!!\nMeanwhile those few who\nhave preferred the comfort\nand luxury of lives in\nEuropean capitals and dare\ncall themselves 'exiled\ndemocrats' are only day-dreamers. Every nation gets\nwhat it deserves as a ruler,\nthe brave nation of Iran\ncertainly does not deserve\nsuch deluded and arrogant\nostriches.\nTruly yours\nHamid M Elec Eng Dept\nMore low cost fares\nmore\nGo v our own way^ ULU Travel\nImperial College, Sherfield Building,\nPrince Consort Road, London SW7 Tel: 01-581 8882\nhA Service of\ng lg tBm mk~* ST A Travel the world sm i^F^^ to j* leading organisation form I/ ULWJL independent youth and \u20221*11 Br^^ k^ student travel TheWorldbeaters 40 = T \u00bbIf you're crossing the finals\nfrontier remember STA Travel is for\nGraduates too!

    "content": "<\nThe Normal Heart arrives at\na time when the prejudice\nthr pwn at us by the\nmajority of the media is\nsadly beginning to sink in.\nThis is an important play,\nnot only for the issues of\nAIDS and the hidden\nhomophobia of the masses,\nbut for the way in which it\nillustrates the power of the\npress and the beau roc rats, and the abuse of that\npower.\nThe play is set in New\nYork City over a period of 3\nyears. The action takes\nplace within the confines of\na simple geometric set\ncovered with banner\nheadlines from the tab lio ds. Apart from a large white\nbox, which serves a multitude of functions, the\nlo or, like the surrounding\nwalls, is featureless, matt\nwhite, and serves to\nintensify the action.\nSuspended above the set\nhangs a large white cross.\nI felt that the\nperformances of Martin\nSheen, who plays Ned\nWeeks a character based\non Kramer's own story, and\nFrances Tomelty as the\ndisabled Dr Brookner were\nparticularly good. They\nt jo th sustained an inner\nintensity and conveyed\nfeeling. The part of Ned's lover, Felix (!) is played by\nPaul Jesson, who I am\nreliably informed is an\nAmerican, despite the fact\nthat his accent see me to\nvary according to his\nemotional state. The\nstandard of the rest of the\ncast varied greatly, almost\nas if they were at times\nrelying too much on the\nplay itself, not being\nbelievable in their parts.\nDespite the inevitable\ntragedy, there is a great\ndeal of typically New York\nTheatre\nThe Normal Heart\nby Larry Kramer\n(Royal Court until May 2nd opening at the Albery later\nin May).\nhumour which I feel has\ntravelled well. The action\ntakes place in a variety of\nsettings, moving from the\nangry Dr Brookner's office\nto Felix's desk at 'The New\nYork Times' to Ned's apartment. Throughout, the\nrealisation of the pending\nepidemic, (pandemic?) is\nseemingly denied by all but\nDr Brookner and Ned, and\nin the end, Ned's anger and\ndrive to tell the world, to\ntake direct action, causes\nhis own alienation from the\ngay community. He\nbecomes the outsider\nwithin the group of\noutsiders.\nThere is much more to\nthis fine piece of writing\nand production, too much\nto fit in here, go and see\nThe Normal Heart.\nto -\u00bb c33 n>o \u2022 H<3 \u00bb o2o>_2o> CD\n_ m QS s8 iS \u2022O^EcD^^ M< EST\n= Q. \u00ab . - J TP rt 3 \" B CD\nCD CD 3 CO\n3 \" 3\nCD \u00a3\n3 ?> \u00a30\no CD\n\u2022 3\na.z to o q \u00a3 cr \u2014\nJ OoO0 \u2022 -* \u00bb\n3 \" 3 rt.

The RSC specialising in staging\nmodern productions of\nShakespeare and new\nclassics. The standard of\nproductions is almost\nalways high. I saw their\nproduction of the The\nMerry Wives of Windsor. If\nyou talk about Shakespeare\nmost people complain and\nsay that it's boring.\nShakespeare wrote his\nplays for the common man\nnot the intellectual.\nUnfortunately the middle\nclasses and university\nlecturers have created an\naura about Shakespeare\nthat means most people\nthink Shakespeare is a boring old fart who they\nhave to read about for\nEnglish O level. The RSC manage to make\nShakespeare approachable.\nThe production of The\nMerry Wives was set in the\nfifties the set was excel lant. The cast included one of\nBritian's most talented\ncomediennes Sheila\nSteafel. All the other lead\nroles were taken by very\nexperienced actors and\nactresses.\nThe wonderful thing\nabout this production was\nthat it was funny and it\npreserved Shakespeare's wonderful English. One can\nmake comments about the\ndirection and the action but\nessentially it's worth going\nto see the play because it\nreminds one how enjoyable\nShakespeare can be.\n8 Friday 25 April\nThe Girl in the Picture\nJohn Gordon Sinclair\n(previously Gregory of\n'Gregory's Girl') returns to\nplay a similar character,\nthis time a photographer, in\nthis gentle comedy about\ntrue love.\nVery much in the vein of\n'Gregory's Girl', it paints an\nattractive picture of both\nGlasgow and the two stars.\nCharming.\nNo Surrender \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n(Odeon Haymarket)\nA very black comedy\ncentred around a nightclub\nin Liverpool and involving\ntwo groups of Protestant\nand Catholic old age\npensioners double booked\non the same night.\nAlan Bleasdale's targets\ninclude old age, conflict\nand reconciliation and\nhuman nature in general. A very sharp and funny\ncomedy, with some\nexcellent acting from the\ntwo leads especially.\nA Room with a View \u2022 + * \u2022 \u2022\n(Curzon)\nA completely flawless film\nof EM Forster's book. Every\nsingle character is ation by\nthe brilliant cast is without\nfault and the direction is\nunobtrusive and skillful.\nHighly recommended.\nHigh Noon \u2022 \u2022 * * (Cannon)\nA chance for all those who\nhave not seen it to catch up\nwith the rest of us. Made\ntowards the end of the\nHollywood Western era it\nconcentrates on the moral\ndilemmas of pacifism and\nstanding up for what is\nright. It also is famous for\nit's skillful pacing and\nhandling of suspense, the\nlength of the film being\nexactly the same as the\ntime in which the action\ntakes place.\nDARYL (Cannon)\nSurprisingly anti-government film for the\ncurrent Reaganite America.\nThe local community fights\nhard to prevent the evil\nauthoritarian military from\ndestroying cute boy-robot.\nCaravaggio \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 * (Lumiere)\nDerek Jarman's personal\nview of the life of the Italian\npainter Caravaggio, and\none of his more accessible\nfilms.\nFilm\nThe costumes, sets and\nphotography are excellent,\nvery much in the manner of\nthe original paintings and\nthe anachronistic devices .\n(see the film and you'll\nknow what are mean) are\nvery clever. From Thursday\nall anti cal Eye's cinema's Lumiere, Chelsea, Camden\nPlaza and soon the Renior,\nformerly Gate Bloomsbury,\nhave half price tickets for\nstudent for the first\nperformance every day.\nThe Man with two Brains\n(Scala)\nVery silly but pretty funny\nstory of a brain surgeon\nwho falls in love with a brain in a jar and becomes\ninvolved with the seductive\nKathleen Turner who gets\nthrough a large number of\nrich husbands.\nComedy very much in\nlove w th Steve Martins\nusual out put, which is\nsimilarly to the Airplane\nsort of humour.\nAbsolute Beginners * * *\n(Odeons)\nCurrently London's most\npopular film, it is a lively,\ncolourful but ultimately\nrather empty musical set in\nthe the 50's at the.time of\nthe race riots (but you must\nknow that).\nMost of the stars play\ntheir come os well and\nEddie O 'Connel is very\ngood, but Patsy Kensit\nvaries from being bad to\npretty good. It is, however,\nnever boring and there are\nsome audacious set pieces.\nFun but cluttered.\nMarie (ABC)\nA state officials fight\nagainst corruption of the\ndepartment around her and\nthe Governor himself.\nSissy Spacek is very\ngood as usual, but the\nstory has a tendency to be\noverly melodramatic and it\nloses momentum towards\nthe end.\nHeatbreakers \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 (Can-non and ICA)\nSexual rivalry and jealousy\nbetween two long time\nbuddies. The superb acting\nand intelligent script raise it\nabove the usual film about\nthis well-run theme.\nUnjustly critics ed for its\nport ral of women, it's a film\nthat is worth considering\nmaking a detour for.\nCrimewave *\nA comedy (supposedly)\nabout two unpleasant\nexterminators hired to\ndispose of a greedy\nbusiness partner. \u2022\nThe attempt to copy\nfifties thrillers is awkward\nand just serves to highlight\nthe shortcomings of the\nfilm. Surprisingly unfunny\nfor a comedy.\nI*9 "

I hope you\nenjoyed trying them\nanyway\u2014I know lots of\npeople tried the crossword.\nI know a lot of you will\nhave exams this term, but\nI 'll keep setting problems\nas long as there's some\nenthusiasm. I 'll try to make\nthem a little easier, though,\nso as not to take up too\nmuch of your precious\ntime.\nA Cable of Cables\nI received several solutions\nto this problem. Two\npeople entered correct\nanswers but with no\nex plant ion as to how they\ngot their answer. I will only\nexcept these solutions if\nthe relevant people send\nme their explanations. I 'll\ngive you until the next\ndeadline on Wednesday at\n1.00pm. Of course, anyone\nelse can enter a solution\nduring that time if they\nwant to.\nSolutions\nQuickies\nWhat costs ten pence for\none, twenty pence for ten,\nand thirty pence for a hundred?\nFront door numbers.\nCorrectly label the boxes.\nTake a marble from the box\nmarked red and blue, say\nit's blue. Since the box was\nwrongly marked it must\ncontain blue marbles only.\nNow, the box marked red\ncannot contain either red\nonly or blue only, so it\nmust be red and blue, and\nthe remaining box is the\n1\none containing reds only.\nHow can you average\n30mph on a journey after\nyou have completed the\nfirst half of the distance at\n15mph? Impossible, you would have\nto complete the second half\nof the journey in zero time.\nScore three consecutive\ngoals without anyone else\ntouching the ball.\nStart by scoring an own\ngoal and then take the kick\noff. Kick the ball forward\ninto the opposition penalty\narea and run after it. Before\nyou touch the ball again\nyou're brought down inside\nthe penalty area and you\ntake the penalty and score.\nAt this point the whistle\ngoes for half-time, take the\nkick off and repeat the\nlatter procedure. It is a bit\ncontrived, but it's only way\nit can be done.\nTriangle Groper Not Hieroglyphics\nThe code is simply based\non noughts and crosses, as\nshown below.\nabc J.k Is tude fm nw \u2022Xi hiP' qr yz First add the extra lines\nshown. The triangles A BF, ADC, BEC Must each have\narea 1/3 by similar tr angles( assume the whole triangle\nhas area 1). Now\nABF+ADC+BEC+x=1+( ar-ea where they overlap).\nThis means that\nADH+JEC+BFG=x. By simla r triangles\n2 XB GF= GF C,2X J EC= JEA,2 X DHA= BDH. Now put all\nthis information onto the\ndiagram:\nIt reads: 'If music be the\nfood of love..' you know the\nrest!\nWrong long division\nThe correct sum is:\n1222\n47|57434\n47\n104\n94\n103\n94\nNow by using similar\ntriangles between HFC and\nHBF and repeating on the\nother two sides we can\nshow that z=y= w= x. Thus\nadding up;\n4x+3X( a+b+c)=7 x=1. Thus x is one seventh of\nthe total area.\n94\n94\nIC Occupations\nAlan is the Mechanical\nEngineer and is 23.\nBob is the Electrical\nEngineer and is 20.\nClair is the Physicist and is\n28.\nDebi is the Chemist and is\n19.\nThis week's problem Shagar s Sheep\nFarmer Shagar's square\nfarmhouse is surrounded\nby a large garden in which\nhe keeps a small flock of\nsheep. He has invented an\ninteresting method of\ncounting them. Every\nevening he goes to the\nwindows in each of the four\nsides of his house and\ncounts all the sheep he can\nsee from the window (he\ncannot see around the\ncorners of the house). I pointed out the stupidity of\nthis since he obviously\ncounts some sheep twice.\n'Ahh', he said ' but\nsometimes I can work out\nexactly how many sheep I have. For instance, the\n, other night I counted the\nsame number of sheep at\nevery window, it was nine.\nTonight I also counted the\nsame number of sheep at\nevery window, and it was\nfive. Now if I tell you that\nneither time did I count all\nthe sheep twice, but neither,\ntime did I count none of\nthe sheep twice, you\nshould be able to tell me\nhow many sheep I have.'\nBut I couldn't. Can you?\nAssume the sheep don't move while he's going from\nwindow to window.\nAnswers to the FELIX\noffice by Wednesday\n1.00pm for the \u00a35 prize.\nComments and ideas\nwelcome as always.\n\n"
