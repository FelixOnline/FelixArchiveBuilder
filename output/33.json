    "content": "2 FELIX\nFIRST NEW STEEPS IN MALAYA\nThis heading appeared recently in a national paper, let us say the\" Morning Press\". The article beneath illustrates the reason why\" Felix\" will never be a popular weekly or two weekly newspaper. Look through this issue, except for this particular article the headline gives a fair idea of the context of the article. This means you can decide to ign q re it. Not so with the\" Morning Press\". The ignorant reader maybe forgiven for assuming that\" First New Steps in Malaya\" might concern Stalin ovsk i1s agricultural scheme for converting the jungle to steps. An informed and intelligent reader would dismiss this idea in favour of its concerning General Temple r's appointment. Maybe the writer was wishing him every success in his roundup, and perhaps recalling some past escapade. It is rumoured that the feet of one of his ancestors, Knights Templar, left their mark in Palestine. A gay Gordon might infer that the\" Two Elegant S a livers\"( that prominent team who so recently rode the storm of London nightlife with marked success) had shot into the public eye by their declared intention of removing to Malaya to teach the natives a new dance step, the\" Bar Bazooka\". It will be remembered that the local chief said, \"We want no spats here.\" You, dear reader, have probably assumed that the Malayan birthrate is going up by leaps and bounds. It would take a fellow reporter to get somewhere near the truth. The article( believe it or not) reads\" Kuala Lumpur, Wednesday.\" Noticing that the villages round here only contain one storey houses a local window cleaner has sold his ladder and bought a pair of steps.\" NEWS IN BRIEF News has re ao he dour ears of a possible change in the name of Clog's College, Caapden Kill Road. Coinciding with the extension to the buildings, a change in the course is anticipated, involving the abolition of the so ei al aspect in favour of nutritional training. Thus the name will as longer be King's College of Household sad So ei al Science, but, it is anticipated9 it will' be-e hanged to Queen\nElizabeth' s College. The offset of all these changes on\nthe social and eating habits of X.G. students has yet to be seen, but is expected that as long as there is an excuse...? A RECENT SATURDAY NIGHT HOP saw the introduction of Square-Dancing to I.C. appropriately enough with the' Virginia Reel At a lecture In the R.C.A.

The exact nature of- their advent must be forever shrouded in mystery as far as FELIX is concerned, for two different and equally reliable eyewitnesses have described them to our reporter, the first as\" a pair of bouncy red haired twins\", the second as\" two little grey mice'.\" We are personally inclined to the first account, but record both for the sake of historical integrity. These twins are still with us, though Ann( who we understand on good authority to be the younger) has now retired to Sil wood to study the more revolting aspects of weevil psychology. A fresher, on seeing Ann at College for the first. time is reported to have expressed delight that there were two of them; we understand the Dip,lomat ie Corps has its eye on him. Ann' s most prominent characteristic is, perhaps, the Catholicism of her activities. Besides the extraordinary attribute of still being interested in the subject in which she graduated( top of her year incidentally) she is also interested in photography and music, and took part, while in London in all the more strenuous diversions associated with the hallowed name of I.C. W.S.C. She may\" sti ir' be observed, on occasion, projecting a missile which we imagine to be not essentially dissimilar from a football with considerable velocity and accuracy from one end of the netball court to the other, accompanied by the frenzied baying which characterises this mystic rite. Ann has also a purple for Women's Cricket, having been Secretary of U.L. W. C.C. The purple blazer over at an frock forms a useful Identification for either twin at ranges up to half a mile. Ann can cover ground on foot at high speed, and once ran for the College, achieving, we believe a pla oe. She covers ground with slightly greater speed in a oar, both she and her sister belonging to the school of lady drivers which is( loosely speaking) competent behind the wheel, but wh i oh when anything mechanical goes wrong,s its pathetically tinkering until a Big StrongMan comes along to put it right.( The other school of lady dr i v&rs of course, comprises\" those who are( strictly speaking) utterly incompetent.) Ann has very decided religious views, being a keen member of the College Christian Union. Her views on any subject are usually very much to the point, and thoroughly practical. She is essentially the kind of person who, without ostentation, contributes much to the College, academically, socially,~ and personally./ Ann has Just succeeded\" Joan Slow as Chairman of the Sil wood Park Committee, having been Secretary for, the. firstterm of the session.

Rugger eup match against L.S J5. sill be\" fene tm and celebrations\" duly completed.\nI.C. gained a convincing win over St. John's Cambridge\nwho in spite of their reputation and speed never recovered from the shook of I.C.'s opening attack which gained 6 points( albeit in well kicked penalty goals) in as many minutes. For any who might still be unaware of the fast, Ballerina Knox\nreached his century this season from his own most atrocious cross kick from which only he could have fielded and scored. The Soeeer team gained a40 win over Wadham College Oxford. The tranquil air of lunch hours has been rent by \"Take\nthe Strain\" and \"Heave\" as the respective colleges have been\ncoaxing and ( s)training their larger members in the gentle art of\" tu go' war\". Guilds who still have most of last years team and own the only rope are firm favourites. It is rumoured that they will run backwards this year. for Guilds are also to be congratulated on having two entrants the Inter-fl olDs go Boxing Tournament.\nCROSSCOUNTRY THE IMPERIAL COLIEGE ROAD RBIAY.\nOn S at. liar, l st the I.C. Cross Country Club is holding it's4 th annual road relay in Hyde Park. Twelve London colleges are competing, and other university teams competing are Durham, Nottingham, Manchester,\nBirmingham, Liverpool, Loughborough, Reading, Southampton\nand Leicester. There will also be a team, which will not\nbe seo ring, made up from some well known athletes, possibly including Roger Bannister, John D isley and Mike Barrett, and\nsome ex University runners Although the I.C. team is stronger than last year,, and have won the London University Championships this season,\nthey will have to do well to gain third position this year. The main opposition comes from Kings, L.S.E., and Loughborough,\napart from the other Universities. The course record, held by\nJohn D isley, may well be broken again this year. The race starts at 2.45 p.m., adjacent to the west end of Rotten Row, and will last about 1} hours. LOUDON COLLEGES TROPHY RACE.\nRun at Walthamstowe, over 4 | miles, Wedi 13th February.\nIt was hoped in this race to win one more Trophy and\nthe Club fielded what they thought to be their strongest team.\nThe start was shockingly managed, in that everyone was away\nexcept I.C. who were left very badly. However, Bill Pain woke up suddenly, knocked over two opponents in the first twenty yards, and ran through the field to come 5 th. Ted Whitlock ran usual excellent race to come 3 rd, whilst Hike Garrod\nran his best this year to come 7 th. All these three broke\nthe existing course record of24 min.7 sees, and I.C. won\nthe team race by a very narrow margin. I.C.59, KINGS 67 L.S.E.70. On Saturday 23rd Feb.

Born lethargic, he has never tried to overcome this handicap yet somehow he managed to occur at Guilds in1948, equipped with an engineering degree which he found qualified him for a postgraduate course in cement mixing. Despite the unaccustomed manual labour involved he still had suf fic i ent energy left to join the Judo Club, where his rotundity was at a premium, for who o an upset a sphere?\nAfter as om nambu lent session as secretary he became\ncaptain in1950, which allowed him full scope for his unrivalled organising ability. The Club's tour of Holland last summer was arranged by means of a single letter which arrived at its destination only a short time after the team.\nHe was hastily elected president. Although somewhat preoccupied with his thesis this year\nhe still strove to turn out for contests. Half the team who\nremained to escort him to the match with Oxford ( Felix18/2/52) were delayed three hours through his late arrival. His close friends will particularly remember his characteristic bluntness of address and his ability to bestow apt\nnicknames with the aid of as light medical knowledge. In retaliation one of his victims referred to him as \"Podge\" a name which has clung to him ever since. It must not be thought however that ho confined his college activities entirely to Judo for he was largely responsible for more than one edition of the Guild's Engineer. In conclusion we would like to take the opportunity of wishing him every success in his new job in Jamaica and to offer him the heartiest congratulations on his recent engage-ment.\nC&G TENNIS The C.& G.L. T.C. completed its winter fixture list on\nSaturday 23rd February with an 8-1 victory against Kings II. Six matches have been played during the Autumn and\nSpring terms, with only one defeat. The Captain, David Dean, would like to thank the members\nfor their enthusiasm and support. The big event \"The Brown Challenge Cup\" (C.&G. vR.S.

Played on the first firm ground this year and fine day\nfor s> me weeks, the opening game of the inter college proved\nas dull and uninteresting as all three matches last year. The R.C.S. pack led by Smith and amongst whom black bearded Hague was prominent, completely subdued the Mines\npack, but having gained possession of the ball little else was done. Although on paper the R.C.S. backline is the most\npowerful of the three colleges they lacked the thru fct necessary\nto take them over the line. Edward's sound kicking was a great asset to the Mines\niii io, on the few occasions when they had the ball were uncertain as to what to do. The only score of the match came\nhalfway through the second half when a loose pass between\nthe Mines halves allowed Jaeobson to swoop into score close to the post^ Coppleman converting. IET BALL There is perhaps at least one reason why the Netball team justifies a mention in\" Felix\" this term, and that is that it has scoured its first resounding victory of the season in the match of S at.9 th Feb., when it beat Q.M. C. II by 28-6. This was at least partly due to unusual accuracy on the part of the shooters, but also by much\nbetter team work in the rest of the players. In the other match of the term the team was soundly\nbeaten 26-8 by U.C., thus continuing last term's grim\nrecord. With only eight regular players, the team manages\nto provide good opposition for most teams and though the3 cores have usually been disappointing it has always had an\nenjoyable game. Thi3 seems to be the main reason for its continued existence. Published by the FELIX Board, Imperial College Uni oh, London, S.W.7. Printed by-S 'il Vous Plait Ltd., , 2, Exhibition Rd., S.W.7. "

    "content": "Viewpoint-FELIX\nTHINKING CR1TJCALLY*\nWe have had in Felix recently a plea to students to adopt a more unorthodox style of dress so that they may express their individuality. This article is a plea for the student to carry this nonconformity several stages further into the realm of the mind. It may be believed that in this College the habit of enquiry and intellectual criticism would be very strong as a result of' the scientific discipline undergone by students. Unfortunately it is in. the lecture theatres, in which the student's day is passed, that these critical faculties begin to be atrophied. All too often science is presented as a dogma and the parts of the subject which are under active criticism are not discussed with the student. Even if there was time for the undergraduate to analyse the underlying assumption of his subject he would find himself ill equipped as the spirit and technique of enquiry are buried under the accumulation of facts necessary for the passing of examinations. When it comes to subjects outside the student's particular special is ation the same attitude of intellectual apathy is apparent. This acceptance of ideas without adequate enquiry into assumptions and implications is one of the blights of modern life. If a system of ideas is held by the' right people' it is accepted, not on its intrinsic merits but for reasons essentially extraneous to its own terms of reference. This applies in all spheres, politics and the arts being particularly susceptible, and to all shades of opinion. A supporter of Picasso can be as non critical as a supporter of Mun ning s, and as much swayed by fashion. There was a time when all university students were believed to be ' red'. This term was not limited to its present exclusively political meaning although that too was included. Bather it implied that the student was in the frontline of contemporary thought, acquainted with all that was new in the arts, philosophy and politics and making his own contribution to them. This no longer seems to be true, the student conforms as much as any other member of the community. But students are still, in some respects, a privileged class in that they have very few responsibilities to tie them down and to force them to conform. All that is necessary is for the student to take advantage of this freedom and liberate his mind. What is needed is a more critical examination of current ideas leading to more independence of thought. We should welcome some of those extravagant flights of fancy, popularly associated with the student mind, which would do much to liven the intellectual atmosphere. Where are the anarchists, the d is tri but is ts, the bi metal lists of yesteryear? from our Music Correspondent On Thursday21 st., the Musical Society, in their lA inch hour recital, departed from the usual run of concerts, and presented a programme of poetry and music. The note supplied intimated that the music and poetry of any period\" reflect the values and temper of the society of the time1; I would contest this statement. The great composers have been men of such genius that they have found their inspiration in things quite apart from their social surroundings, i.e. their inspiration has come from within themselves. I have Beethoven in mind atl write this. Mozart and Haydn do not apply to these remarks, nor do the more nationalistic composers such as Chopin. But what of the concert? Let me say at first that the idea of mixing poetry and music is a good one if the works are Carefully chosen. Shame to us the n,asa Musical Society, that although the poetry was admirably selected and read, the music did not come up to standard, either in choice or in performance. In trying to show\na progression from Haydn to Chopin, It W \u00abS hardly wise to include two movements of the relatively early\" Moonlight\" Sonata I0p27 j, preceded\\!7 by two of the0 pl26. Bagatelles. surely some Brahms or. Schumann should have been included in preference to one of the Beethoven items. However, much could be written on this topic and I will leave readers with the question,\" Do you think that tau sic and Poetry depend on the social surroundings of their age, and if you went to the Thursday Concert, do you think the Society proved their case?\" Is hall be interested to learn. cum mm\nSOCIAL FRIDAY, FEB.29 TH.

    "content": "FELIX\ncritic: at the open lectures Two weeks ago. Professor Levy gave the first of the' open lectures' which will beheld every Friday this terra, and the three early next terra,in the J ux ley Building at4.15 p.m. His talk was entitled\" Scientific influences in Literature\". He first pointed out the necessity of language to science, for the exchange and expression of ideas, and the contribution made in turn by science to the general vocabulary with such expressions as\" going of fata tangent\", etc. His main theme\nwas that creative literature of this age, the industrial and scientific age, should be judged by its progressive ness its use and expression of modern ideas and ambitions. It is always well worth going to hear Prof. Levy on\nthese occasions, although he was more quiet and thoughtful in his remarks, the same principles governed his opinions as\nalways, typified by the words ' progressive', and ' out of date* used as' good', and' bad'. Quotations from poems by\nTennysson, Whitman, Spender, and others, were read by Miss Spalding. Professor Levy also referred to Aldous Huxley and\nShaw, the latter being,\" despite his opinions on some bra no he s of science\", the progressive and optimistic ex a a yle. It was unfortunate that the lecturer gave the impression that his quotations were not chosen from a great experience of literature: but rather that his opinions sprung from those very authors. The time limitations did not help him in this. Other lectures for this term include \"The Impact of Science on Music',' \" Science and Architecture',' and \" Structure, in Musical Composition\" ( today). The first three next\nterm area group on \" Scientific Writing and Reporting\", and\nwill be given by Professor Levy.\nWe hope that the use of the tape recorder at these met tin go will be extended. They already have Professor Weiner' s address to the Guilds' last year on record; all that is needed is a cheap and popular journal for publishing the lectures. FELIX has not the space. PHOENIX is not\ncheap. This system could also include contributions by\nthe distinguished visitors who give the opening addresses\nat Touchstone meetings.\nimp FELIX STAFF\nEXPAND our News Service join FELIX as a reporter j be one\nof the News Editor's trusted writers. FELIX is hoping to expand its outlook by increasing its in look. We also require Dramatic, Debating, Social and Political Correspondentsp refer ably people not fully involved in the parent I.C. organization. PRODUCTION\nA production staff has been set up under the production manager. More volunteers are required for inclusion in this staff so that no person need be overworked.\nFelix makeups take place every alternate Sunday during term time( that is twice per month). Three shifts of hour\nduration are organised, in the morning,afternoon and evening,\nand ideally no one person needs to do more than one 2-J hour\nshift. A rota is placed on the Phoenix x notice board a week\nbefore the make-up is due; the list bears the names of those\nwho have already volunteered and there is also space available for other volunteers. All volunteers are asked to attend a production staff meeting to be held on Monday 1 0 th. Marsh 1952, at1.15. p.m., in Committee Room ' A'. Finally if you have already volunteered please remember\nto look for the Felix make-up rota on the Phoenix notice board\nand TICK OFF YOUR NAME.\nx Editor's note \"SharasJ\"\nTHE GUILDS' ENGINEER\nSome journals, of this and other Colleges, point with pride to the length of time that they have been established. This, however, will not be a failing of the Guilds' Engineer for some time to come, as this May will see only the third issue. The Guilds' Engineer is the Journal of both the City and Guilds Engineering and Radio Societies, and so, with the exception of Chemical Engineering, it has the whole field of Applied Technology as its system. The journal has three main functions. It provides a record of those proceedings of the two societies which are worthy of transmission to posterity; it encourages the presentation of papers which are of general or particular interest; and it provides a report on the research work being undertaken in each department. It therefore helps to keep Old central ien s in touch with the technical progress at College, and also gives to the undergraduates some idea of what actually does goon in the peculiar laboratories of the other departments. It is useful too, if they wish to find out what the research work in their own department entails but are too bashful to make a direct enquiry, for fear of committing themselves. It might be imagine a that the chief worry of the Editorial staff would be the obtaining of copy. Actually, this is not so, as quite a large number of students are generally prepared to contribute,' provided they obtain enough notice. The chief problem is financial, and although the journal is just about paying its way, each annual production is still an anxious affair. \u2022When Guilds men become Old Central ian s, they will have the privilege of buying the Guilds' Engineer at five shillings a copy, thus reaping the benefits already enumerated. To enable them to part regularly with this sum, and with the minimum of anguish, all students before they leave will be asked to sign a Bankers' Order form for five shillings a year. This will provide the Guilds Engineer for them throughout their future career, with no further action on their part, and it will also ensure a guaranteed income for the Journal. G.P.A.

Entertained at an informal buffet by the I.C. R.F.C. on the eve of their return home, after nearly six months touring, Stephen Fry, the wing forward( whose brother is fly half) and Ben My burgh displayed that charm which seems to be so natural to South Africans. No subject was\ntoo trifling or so of t discussed not to be treated with consideration, while players about whom\nthere is much controversy in Britain, came through with never a hard word. A.E.R. Fry the eldest of the family was a Guilds man, being a member of the Links club, Capt. of U.L. R.F.C and VicePresident of Guilds in'37'38. He\nwas killed on active service during the war All to o3o on the evening sped by with many a tale and yarn until it was time to bid our guests and all the\" Springbok s\" bon voyage. DOODLING FOR DELINQUENTS THE STATE OF THE STATES On the evening of Tuesday11 th. February the I. C.W. A. lounge, with a fire burning in. the grate, was both warm and comfortable, and members and guests gathered there for tea followed by a discussion. Miss Prudence Hill, This year's hon. VicePresident gave a very stimulating and enthralling talk about her recent. three months' visit to the United States. She de\u00bbcri bed with great vividness her journey by oar from New\nYork south through the states of Virginia and the Caro Un as down to Hew Orleans and up through the Wealth of Texas\nthe monotony of Mexico, the barren and\nprimaeval mountains of Arizona, through\nCalifornia and up to San Francisco. Throughout this journey she had made\na searching study of the vastly varying peoples and the country she saw, and collected astore of lively impressions of the way of life and the modes of thought\nof the American peoples. By talking with those she met, attending university lectures, visiting schools, art galleries and museums, His sHill obtained a varied and fascinating insight into American\nSociology. She gave a thoughtful and liberal analysis of the American outlook as\nit appeared to her, a foreigner in their country j but she was careful to stress that these were her own opinions and\ntherefore subject to errors. Though handicapped by a severe cold, Miss Hill's obvious interest in her subject, and her aptitude for transmitting her enthusiasm, aroused everyone present into a discussion in which prejudices and notions about the ' States were re examined and much revised. As this was such an interesting evening, it is hoped to hold a similar I function early next term. NINETIES\n- MARCH14 th.or How Not to be Browned Off ski,,,\" Mathematics is a very simple subject, and interesting mathematics is very simple indeed.\" Those present at the last meeting of the R.C.S Maths, and Physical Society who survived the shock of these introductory words were then entertained to an exceedingly interesting and well presented lecture on \"How to Doodle\" by Dr Bron own ki. Soon after his marriage Dr. Bronowski became a temporary civil servant and,\nfeeling a little doubtful as to the correct training for the job, he sought his wife's! advice.\" Learn to doodle\", was the reply. Or Bronowski being a mathematician was not]\ncontent just to doodle, but having doodled wanted to know whether ' his doodle had any\ninteresting properties. The question he asked himself was what sort of doodle can be\ndone whit h out taking the pencil off the paper. Having proposed such a question, the lecturer then, with some disagreement from the audience, defined a good mathematician\nas one who can not only solve the problem, but one who thinks the problem is a good\none. For the benefit of those not covered by such a definition it was then shown how\nto solve the problem Bradshaw's rule, viz. th \u00bb t the number of trains arriving at a junction must exactly equal the number of trains leaving that junction. Solutions of this sort of problem had been given by Euler who was prompted by\nthe cite zen s of Koenigsberg asking if they could cross each of their7 bridges once\nand once only on their Sunday afternoon walks. The problem which is much more common\nin England is that of how to lay water, gas, and electricity mains to three houses\nwhit h out any of the lines crossing. Dr. Bronowski ended by saying that the study of topology - the technical name\nfor the study of a doodle - wu old give great aesthetic satisfaction. It was in fact the answer to those people who thought scientists but dull being*. The lecturer, who was introduced by Professor Levy, was giv on an enthusiastic welcome by some 250\nand guests present. An Evening Standard reporter also attended.\nHABLEQUINADE\nLast Saturday evening the Dramatic\nSociety add ad originality to their dance by presenting during the course\nof the evening \" Harlequin a de\", a one-act play by Terrence Ratti gan.' The audience was appreciative and sym-pathetic, and enhanced the performance\nwith improvisations in the I.C. manner.\nThis ti lay was to be their contribution to the L.U.D. S. festival, and we\nare glad to know that this may yet be\nheld. I tried a rhyme rIt would not do.I tried another; that was two. I tried a third; it was rejected. I went off home, far too dejected.

WSAHNE\nWh ile it is beyond our powers to expand the Union accommodation, we might pause and think how best we can use what is available: of how collectively we o an least hinder the individual, and how individually we can best fit into such makeshift arrangements as must be made. It seems unlikely that the ba sio problem of space will be solved within our time at college, or that of anyone here now. The bad period of the day is the middle of the lunch hour; in the two Lounges( total seating100) and the Union Entrance Hall. At this time the Refectory queue forms spirals through lt and well in t6 the Old Lounge. This Is already overcrowded by the informal meetings and games, Bridge in particular, which have nowhere else togo; exo ep t to the two committee rooms. But one of these houses the Soo i al Clubs' lockers, two large cupboards, an unusable full size billiards table and some\ngym mata, and the other is infrequent use for committee meetings, and is also the FELIX Office in between time Whilst those aware of these detail so ando nothing more than protest, and meanwhile watch the progress of the new Aeron aut io al Department building, the restoration of another hotel In Queens gate, etc., lt Is up to us to look after what we have got: not to leave it untidy, not to dominate the Lounges with our game, not to spill beer on the table s,eto. The Old Lounge Is the' only general room available for S nter tal n lng yourselves or guests in the evening; the Bar should keep its special celebrations within its walls, and at the same time the Lounge should not be, used as a general lovers' lane for those without a better place to pursue those without better boyfriends.

Appeal Fund. This month the British student Tuberculosis Foundation comes into being. Sponsored by the National and Scottish Union of Students, the' British Medical Students Association and the world University service, the scheme aims at providing, in a converted mansion near to both a large sanatorium and a University, a centre to which tuberculous students could go when they were well enough to restart study during gradual re habitation. The first report on the progress made by the Appeal has now been published. This shows that the average sum contributed by Universities, Colleges and Training Colleges is at the rate of6/ per head. The highest individual rate was obtained by the County Training! College, Crewe who with only100 members, turned in over \u00a3 7 0 . So far a tI.C., in the summer term of last year, \u00a3237 were collected. It is hoped, before sending in our contribution, to raise it to a figure comparable with the national average. We fell that the time has arrived for another whip round:2s.6 d. from those who did not contribute before, and6 d. from everyone else. The longer the raising of the Capital takes, the less is its purchasing power, and the smaller the national recognition of the appeal. Your set c.,C imp AT.

N.B. The* is very difficult to do also. Dear Sir, DSaATBS REPORTS\nAn old boot lace to Felix for the report, or lack of it in your last issue, on the American Debate held a tI.C. Union on the31 st. January. My complaint is not so much against the length of the paragraph devoted to it5 i lines, as against the sentiment expressed in it. It was not by an attitude of this sort that Felix grew to popularity. It is odd that while a whole column on the frontpage was devoted to the U.L. U. debate, which also had an attendance of150 p* ple,a similar function inside our own Union should be given such deplorable mention. Your seto. B.R. V. walker.21.2.52 Our correspondent replies i 'The reply lien in the defense of the critic* right to express his opinions of an event in as original and\nenterprising a manner as possible. When a debate of no\nspecial significance in itself occurs , the critic o an either write columns of rather insipid commentary , or dismiss the thing in a few well chosen phrases. If my\nphrases are_ not well chosen the Editor will sack me, fc utI feel\" quite sure that my impression was clearly expr es sed; that the debate was well worth attending, but not worth more than& J lines of column space . As for the U.L. debate, that was important. The-Amsrioan debate\nwas not. "
