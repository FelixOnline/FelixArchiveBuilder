The Caving Club has\na long history of expeditions including places\nas far afield as Peru, Mor rocco and the\nHimalayas.\nLast Summer a group of undergraduates\nand postgraduates spent six weeks exploring\nand mapping previously unknown potholes\nin a remote high altitude plateau of the Julian\nAlps (North West Slovenia).\nDue to the difficulty in reaching the\nplateau it was necessary to live on the\nmountain top in a bivouac where there were\nno rivers and the only source of water was\nfrom snow plugs. Three new cave systems\nwere discovered and a further two were\nextended significantly. The talk will include\nphotographs of these new caves.\nIn February four members of the\nexpedition left their caving equipment and\nput on their winter mountaineering gear in\norder to visit the plateau while under deep\nsnow in order to search for holes blowing\nthrough the snow which are a clue to as yet\nunknown cave systems.\nWhat they found was much better than\nthey had expected and will be the key to this\nyears Summer expedition back to the plateau.\nThe talk is on Thursday, 8 June at 12.30pm in the Biology W2IW3 lecture theatre.

Why is\nthe Collector after Brayker? Well,\nBrayker has an ancient key, that\ncan unlock the universe and the\nCollector wants it - simple really.\nBrayker, however, is only mortal\nand his sole weapon against the\nCollector is the blood contained\ninside this key. Originally if was the\nblood from a carpenter - crucified\nat Calvary, but each dying keeper\nreplenishes the key before passing\nit on to the next chosen one.\nFortunately Demon Knight\ndoes not become an Alienesque\nkilling demon scenario or a Friday\nthe 13th. It's a film full of excellent\nideas. However close attention\nneeds to be paid to avoid confusion\nin some scenes, as you may start\nasking yourself, how could that\nhappen?\nCollector Billy Zone is\ncharismatic throughout the film, a fact that allows his character to\nseduce all the boarding house\nguests in the attempt to retrieve the\nkey. His character is very much\nalong the lines of Beetlejuice\n(comically frustrated) and the Joker\n(the devil with a big smile), which\nproves to be effective.\nDemon Knight is not\nparticularly scary; there is less\nshock and more special effects\ndemon knight\ngore, perhaps in an attempt to\nmake some people feel a tiny bit\nnauseous.

He wants to\neliminate the Rich family so that he\ncan take over Rich Industries.\nMysteriously, Richie's parents go\nmissing leaving Richie in charge. To\ndefeat Van Dough, he seeks the\nhelp of a group of city kids who\nbefriend him.\nAs a Macauley Culkin film,\nRichie Rich is predictable. It's very\nmuch in the same vein as his other\nfilms with plenty of slapstick\nhumour and Macauley Culkin\nattempting to save the day.\nHowever it also has vomit-inducing ly sentimental undertones\nwith the moral of the story being\nthat true friendship should be\nvalued more than money.\nUndoubtedly Richie Rich is by\nfar inferior to Home Alone and\nUncle Buck, the main problem\nbeing that Culkin's cuteness is\nrapidly diminishing. But as the idea\nof being the richest kid in the world\nis every child's dream, it will\nprobably be readily lapped up by\nthe pre-pre-pubescent audience.\nAdults, on the other hand will find\nit a silly but harmless film, which is\nmildly amusing in places and just\nabout bearable.

Every traveller must consider the same questions. Where should I go, and\nwhy? How should I travel? How will I eat and live? In this week's S files we\nI take the theme of travel and look at three scientific expeditions, in 1831, in\n1957 and in 1994.\nIn 1831, Charles Darwin, then little more than a beetle collector, was\nengaged as a ship's naturalist on the Beagle which was on its way to map the desolate coast of\nSouth America. He didn't see England again for five years, and in the time he was away, he\ncollected plants, animals and also fossils, writing in his journal: \"a fine group of fossil bones\ntell their story of former times with almost a living tongue\".\nIn 1957, Imperial's Natural History Society gained funding from the Exploration Board\nfor the first time to make an expedition to a region of tropical rainforest in Ghana, West\nAfrica. They studied the changes in food crops caused when forest was\nfelled, and the report about this trip,\nalong with others to Greece (1959),\nIran (1960), Ethiopia (1962), Uganda\n(1965), Greenland (1966) and many\nother places, are in the Haldane\nlibrary (General Books 910.4).\nBelow, find out what Darwin ate,\nwhere he slept and what he thought\nabout it all as he sailed towards the\nGalapagos Islands. See how the IC\nteam felt about West Africa, and\nwhat they did there. And on the right, hear first-hand about one IC student who, last year,\nwent diving off a tiny Tanzanian island to help save the coral reef.\nIn comparison with the exotic locations in Africa, Asia and India visited by many\nImperial expeditions, two reports look slightly different. They are from the teams which\nvisited Cornwall. It just seems to prove the point made in the introduction to Ghana 1957:\n\"Exploration indicates doing something new, and exploration in the biological sense is\npossible anywhere in the world - even in one's back garden\".\nS files\nTypical menu:\nMwtfon and corned beef,\n!lf|f^.

In that area, there are\nproblems with people coming down to the sea and\n\"dynamite fishing\" - blowing the fish up so that they\nfloat to the surface. Also the reefs are being\ndestroyed by people paid to collect coral and sell it\nfor trinkets.\n> What is being done?\nThe project I worked on is organised by Frontier,\nwho have also done conservation projects in rain\nforests in Vietnam, game parks in Uganda and the\nRufiji Delta near Chole. They only go in when the\ngovernment of the area invites them. Frontier is\ntrying to turn the area into a multi-user marine park\nwhich the locals, the tourists and the\nconservationists will all be happy with. So they're\nteaching sustainable fishing and doing research\nprojects about the area.\n> How did you help?\nOur job was to dive around the reefs in pairs, and\none of us would count the number and type of fish -there were about 60 species - while the other one\ndid a Benthic survey, looking at the surface of the\nreef and seeing whether it was rock, coral, sand or\nsea grass. We had plastic slates and pencils to write\nit all down.\n> What did you eat?\nGenerally what the locals ate: rice, fish and kidney\nbeans, although we did have the luxury of a bottle\nof soy sauce. There was lots of fresh fruit, bananas\nand green oranges. We took it in turns to get up,\nstart the fire, and cook breakfast, which was Ugisort of maize porridge with sugar.\n> What sort of place did you live in?\nChole is a really idyllic island, and we lived in long\nopen huts made of mangrove poles and woven\npalm leaves. We slept on the floor, and our\nindividual spaces were marked out with mosquito\nnets hanging from the ceiling. We dug our own\ntoilets - a pit six feet square and ten feet deep with\nmangrove poles across it. Then you squat - it was\nsurrounded by a fence, though!\n> What was the atmosphere like?\nAbsolutely superb. Nobody knew anyone else\nbefore they went but it was excellent. There's a real\ncommunity aspect to Chole and the locals accepted\nus being there. There's a hotel being built on the\nisland now, and tourism is developing. Eventually I think people who visit places like Kenya will also\nhear about Chole.\n> Was the project part of your degree?\nIt's certainly helped with my degree - not directly,\nbut I was in Tanzania learning how to sample and\ncollect data, while half of the people on my course\nwere on a marine ecology field trip in Cornwall.\nFrontier are at 77, Leonard Street, London\n(Old St Tube)\nf FELIX D2JUR95\n\n"

We\nchose Air France and thought we'd picked well - the bag of in-flight\ngoodies under the seats in front\ncontained toffees and games\ncartridges. Later, realising the\nbags belonged to the children\nsitting in the seats, we guiltily\nreplaced them, sans toffees.\n\"We ate fish fresh from the lake and\npersuaded ourselves\nthat seeing dawn\nfrom the top of the\nvolcano would be\nworth the climb\"\nLanding at Kuta beach at t le\nsouth': end of t lw island, wo found\na taxi and got stuck in a huge\nt raff i. int. It\nga v us a chance to watch the\nAustralian surfers on one side of\nthe road and the restaurants on\nthe other, and wonder whet' er the\nrest o* Bull was like this\nWe made our escape to\nDenpasa*, the capital s town, the\nnext day Were the hawkers were\nincredible, making you feel guilty\nfor not stopping, then guilty for not\nwanting to buy anything, then\nguilty for haggling, and finally\nguilty for paying what was\nprobably far too much for\nsomething you didn't really want. .\nIn Ubud, the artistic central\nregion of Bali, we ate nasi gore ng in one restaurant ranged down the\nside of a gorge and in another\nsurrounding a pool covered in\nlotus. The galleries were full of\nvivid black-outlined green and red\npaintings of men and women\nworking in the rice paddies\ncul itv a ted on every sloping surface.\nWe met one elderly Spanish artist\nsitting in his gallery: something of\na shock, as from the sign outside I had thought that the establishment\nwas a memorial to someone long\ndead. He talked about his recent\nmeeting with Michael Jackson in\nSingapore with peculiar excite-ment.\nWe took a be mo local\ntransport - north to Penelokan at\nthe foot of Mount Batur, the\nremaining active volcano around a much larger crater now filled by a lake. We ate fish fresh from the\nlake and persuaded ourselves that\nseeing dawn from the top of the\nvolcano would be worth the climb.\nNext morning at 3.30am, Made, our local guide, arrived and\nwe and the two Germans who\nwere also making the ascent\nstruggled to the foot of the\nmountain. The honeycomb rock\nwas loose and very sharp, and\nMade, the shortest and lightest of\nthe party, dragged me up the\nsteep places. Two and a half hours\nof climbing found us at the top,\nwatching the sunrise, eating eggs\nboiled in volcanic steam, and\ncongratulating each other. We\nbought some Coke from a friend\nof Mode's who had apparently run\nup the mountain behind us\nwearing flip flops.\nOn the way back to Kuta we\ndrove along roads now fringed\nwith pe jong poles, long bamboos\nfrom which hung flowers and\nwoven offerings. The dashboard of\nthe be mo displayed pink flowers\nand a little tray of joss sticks. Kites\nflew in the distance: it was a day\nof celebration.\nWe left Bali knowing that\nwe'd have to go back. My\nphotographs are filled with rice\npaddies and sun which spills out\nevery rainy English day that I open\nthe album.\nRebecca Mileham\nSouth Africa\nIf you want a real adventure\nholiday why not try South Africa. I did and loved every bit of it. I stayed there for three weeks with a friend from College: if you intend\nto see all of it you definitely need\nmore time. We hired a car in the\nfirst two weeks and drove a total\ndistance of three thousand miles,\nmuch to the hire company's horror. The last week was spent on\nSafari in South Africa's famed\nKruger National Park.\nOur first stop in South Africa\nwas Jan Smuts Airport and it didn't take long to find our bearings, sort\nout a car and a place to stay. The\ntourist industry in South Africa is a little immature but because of this\nall the tourist businesses are very\nfriendly and helpful.\nJohannesburg is not a city for\nthe timid. It has the highest\nmurder rate in the world but this\ndidn't stop us checking out the\nnight life. Caesar's Palace was our\nfirst sample of South African\nculture and we were very imp-res sed. For the price of pizza in\nLondon, we got our entry tickets\nand unlimited free food.\nEverything seemed so cheap. One\npound goes a long way and,\ndespite the price of the air ticket,\nthe holiday turned out to be a bit\nof a bargain.

A quick dash for the car stopped our\nwallets being pinched.\nSouth Africa has still got a long way to go before it can claim\nit is a racially equal society. The\ngeneral attitudes of both whites\nand blacks seemed like an\napartheid still existed. For this\nreason we spent most of our time\nassociating with the whites.

We spent the next\nweek and a half driving down the\n'Garden Route'. This route takes\nyou through many black\nindependent states (now a part of\nSouth Africa) and finding camp\nsites near the beach was easy. The\nbeaches were deserted and\nbreathtakingly beautiful and we\ncertainty were in paradise. The\nend of the first two weeks was\ndrawing too close too quickly.\nDrifters Adventure Holidays\nsupplied us with entertainment for\nthe last week.

We were lucky enough to\nsee something very rare on our\nsafari, a lion and lioness making\nlove.\nThe role of the lazy lion in his\nhabitat is simply to reproduce and ,\neven this takes some encouragement from the lioness.

Oh,\nwhat's this? It's the early '80s and\nthe police are live! in america.\nSting is disarming ly free of\npretension, Stuart Copeland is not\nwriting film scores and Andy\nSummers is as anonymous and\nextremely old as usual. I can take\nin the profound social and political\ncommentary that is 'de do do do,'\nde da da da' and while away my\ntime pondering its significance. I can chuckle at the pseudo-r egg a isms of 'roxanne' (but enjoy\nit all the same) and cast a nostalgic\near back to the perennial classics of\n'don't stand so close to me', 'so\nlonely', 'message in a bottle' and\nbest of all, 'every breath you take'.\nHey, this isn't bad - they knew how\nto get a crowd going and in those\ndays the only stress I had came\nfrom worrying whether Optimus\nPrime was going to recover from\nhis near fatal clash with Megatron.\nMaybe they should reform so that I can be forever sentimental. Then\nagain, why should they when Sting\ncan write manifestly inferior tosh\nand earn copiously greater\nquantities of cash? Like exams,\nsome injustices never go away. (6)\nSituated in the armpit of\nCamden Town's trendy anatomy,\nthe Laurel Tree pub is a haven for\nthose in the know. Owain assured\nme that \"that's where Blur hang-out\", so I was rife with excitement!\nAfter a15 minute brainstorm trying\nto remember what the street was\ncalled, we arrive. But Blur? Blah!\nUpstairs at the Laurel Tree is a room the size of yer average\ndouble-bedroom. Still it was where\nthe psy clone rangers make their\ndebut London appearance.\nMy ears were feeling quite\ncathedral thanks to the supports,\nbut that wasn'ta problem; the\nrangers decided to go one notch\nhigher. Not a band for the faint\nhearted. Jonathan Valania (lead\nguy) conceded they were not a hip\ngrunge band from Texas (actually\nAllentown, Pennsylvania?), and\nthen kicked into 'feel nice', their\nfirst single released back in 1993.\nThe set also includes tributes to;\nDick Dale - \"Dick Dale, Dick Dale,\nDick Dale, Dick Dale!\", bassist P.R Behler's Father (for his tips on\nBritish girls, chocolate and plastic\ngloves), and a quick word from\ntheir sponsors, Honeycombs\nbreakfast cereal, who have been\nreplaced by Kellogs in the UK.\nFar from making some huge\nstatement about modern society,\nthe Psyclone Rangers are simply out\nto do what they want. Like Valania\nsaid, \"one day you wake up and\nrealise you don't want a Merc and\na condo in the suburbs, then it's time to say 'f*k it!' and just go for\nwhat you really want\".\nThere seems to be some\nconfusion on this one; is electro pura yo la ten go's seventh or\neighth album? Not one for the faint\nhearted I'm sure you'll agree. What\nis certain though, is that Yo La\nTengo have been around for a long, long time with little of the\nrecognition that some would\nsuggest has been their due.\nBut it is slowly changing,\nparticularly after the warming,\nstorming tsunami of an album that\nwas 1993's 'painful'. Now 'electro pura' sees a louder band getting\ns cu zz all ed in form and function.\nIra Kaplan's voice still drones,\nGeorgia Hubley occasionally takes\nvocal control with shy confidence,\nbut the group's driving force\nremains their love of some good\nguitar reverberation and semi-inane odd-ball attitude that\nprovides us with a running\ncommentary of the album on the\nsleeve notes. And as far as they\nmay seem to head into Sonic Youth\ncountry, Yo La Tengo never end up\nalienating or attempting to spook\ntheir audience with art school\nangst.\nAs they write about their\ncurrent single, 'torn courtenay' - \"a group is like a jig-saw puzzle,\neverything must fit into the\ngroove\". 'Electr-o pura' has no\nmissing pieces. (9)\nyo la ten go postage stamp Not impressed?

Loosely autobiographical in respect to growing up\nin Bombay and then Karachi,\n'Midnight's Children' is in actuality\nfar broader - the history of an\nentire subcontinent wrapped up in\nthe brief span of four hundred and\nsixty three pages.\nAnd yet the amazing thing is\nthat it works on both these two\nlevels, macro and micro, as they,\nin turn, work together and apart.\nThe currents of an independent\nIndia, breaking into Pakistan and\nBangladesh, and the labyrinth ian roots of its politics, shape a family\njust as the members of that family\nshape countries by their actions,\nthoughts and most bizarrely,\nphysique.\nIt would be wrong to limit the\nwork to the East though.\n'Midnight's Children' has as much\nrelevance to western ideas of\ncitizenship and state as to the\ngreen chutney munching fraternity\nof the Bombay middle-class. It's also dazzling read. O FELIX "

He acknowledged that the police would be\nunlikely to deal with small time\noffenders, but said that the local\nconstabulary were concerned\nabout the scale of the problem at\nImperial. Last week there were\nmore drugs related incidents at\nIC than in all of the rest of\nKnightsbridge.

The\nComputing Department side of\nthe Huxley building has been\nfree from thefts since the\ninstallation of infra-red detectors\nearlier this month, but the\nPhysics Department is not\nequipped with the sensors.\nThe man arrested on\nExhibition Road in April for\nthefts from the Huxley building\nover the Easter holiday was\ncharged and released on bail last\nFriday.

    "content": "Travel Special\nLeave this City When Jack Kerouac wrote ' On the Road' he redefined a feeling\nthat, despite the press spin at the\ntime, is probably as old as man\nitself. We are wanderers: our vast\nspread across the planet is\nprobably as much an indication\nof the need to move as of that for\nspace to live and stand still in.\nAnd those weary levi'd travellers\nof America's fifties share much in\ncommon with the hordes of\nbackpackers that shift across the\nplanet like locusts, devouring\nculture and spending dollars.\nEveryone is looking for the\nand sometimes the next\nmountain, range can be enough lo\n\"i you on. Our l;:<r fcd led with signifiers of^the\ni rap or.'. freeways', the myth of the\nfrontier, i he priceless \"passport'.\nBui equally, by definition, navel\ncan only lie a temporary solution.\nWhen the travelling stops the\nliving begins again and whe the i(H?'i \u00abi$ j|a*h on fe ore x&i grc tet* disappointment can only follow\nthe excitement of the road.\nAgain, the bohemian leaving\nPrague or Bali is only a little\nremoved from the silence in a family car driving back from\nHeathrow after two weeks in the\nSouth of Spain. Anyone who\nfinds his happiness walking to\nthe greener grass will never smile\nover the final pasture.\nAnd so to this issue. We\ndecided that, rather than attempt\nto provide an all-too-slight\noverview of travel options and\nticket prices, we would present\nin sie ad experiences. Individual\n'postcards' that, we hope, might\nlus i in you or, better, to lake a vague already present notion and\ns pui11 into action.\nThe selection of articles are\nare a reflection oi the feelings\nthey inspired in those who went\nto i he m. As such, I hope they\nprovide a brief insight into i he surprising how easy it was to get\npeople to write about their\nfavourite destinations, it was\nastonishing how many of them\nwanted to simply return to the\nsame place again.\nAs for my own voyages,\nnothing\"prepared me for my\nmodest escape last summer.\nDespite being born in Australia\n(emigrating at nine) my family,\nhas in the main, led a land locked\nexistence. In fact, I could never\nreally understand i he concept ol\n8:w.: that\nthere were places where people\nspoke differently to us, but the\nstrange language of Chaucer and\nelectromagnet waves seemed far\nmore down to earth.\nIt was only when my plane\ndisgorged me at Charles de\nGaulle i hatI realised there really\nwere other lands and other\npeoples. They say that travel\nexpands the mind; i he vast\ndiversity ol human culture was\ninstantly forced upon me and my\nworld view changed. I ran about\nthe airport and the metro looking\nat words in French, amazed that\nthey meant something to the\npeople around me. And then, less\nobviously I met some French\npeople and found them, corn i ly, not that different from myself.\nAn alien and unknown city,\nthe helplessness of a divorce ment from language, the solid reality of\nhitherto mythical places like the\nLouvre and the the Seine - they\nin turn made the whole world\nseem real in some way. Behind\nevery postcard now there is a real\nplace, with a million intersecting\nlife-lines crisscrossing via the\nmail and the aeroplane.\niiS; I know now that I must travel\n!|il4 see something of the world,\nbut my greatest fear is of\n, the vacuous country-iio drinks McShakes\nfrom Peru lo Portugal. I hate the\nr its own sake; it\n\u2022st. But\nas I ponder trips I know too that\nthat's my only reason for going.\nWell here we are, with only three\nterm and only two more issues ol\nLIX. Uoo-hou.

    "content": "Postcards\nl/ ou have probably heard\ntales of cheap beer, cigarettes, food and all night\nparties in We nc square. But Prague is a city of beauty and culture, its atmosphere unique, un sullied by the\nWestern ethos.\nA twenty three\nhour coach journey\nwith just one stop\n(twenty minute break!

There was a tense silence as\nwe drifted past the crumbling concrete factories into the\ndilapidated bus\nstation, each passenger fearing they\nhad made a terrible\nmistake but unable\nto face the stupendous deflation of admitting it. We left\nthe coach, got our currency (you\ncannot buy Kronas in England so\ntake pounds) and flopped onto a patch of grass by a tiny food van. We\nhad arrived.\nWe had, however, seen only\nthe worst of what the city had to\noffer. Things looked up when we\nfound a fantastic campsite, a small\nplace run by a friendly young man who gave us a discount and had\nfruit trees and cats.\n( Camp Dana\nTroyska 1) It was a mile or so out of the centre, but \u2022 >\nPrague's public transport system is\nexcellent, costing 6K cs(~13p) to go\nanywhere at any time on bus, tram\nor underground. Camping is the\nbest option as hostels are over\ncrowded and have strange rules.\nI don't remember our first trip\nto the centre, except our stupid\nattempts to pay the tram driver.\n(You are supposed to buy tickets in advance and punch them in one of\nthe pleasantly\n\"Prague 10 ac it p of me c han ica 1\nbeauty and\nculture...tte\na tr/ to&p/> ere 10\nunique\"\nEcuador\nI recently worked on a four month\nexpedition to Ecuador in South\nAmerica. The country crosses the\nequator and that is what gives it its\nname. We raised most of the\nmoney for the expedition from\ngrant-giving bodies such as The\nImperial College Exploration Board\nand The Royal Geographic Society,\nas well as through personal\ncontributions.\nThe capital city is Quito. It lies\nalong a valley, surrounded by\nmountains. The houses extend up\nthe mountain slopes. In one town\nthat I visited there was a house on\nthe top of a hill, with farmland all\naround it stretching down the hill.\nPloughing is done using oxen and\nmay be on slopes that are at forty-five degrees to the horizontal.\nQuito is the second highest capital\ncity in the world at about 2400m above sea level. We were there\nfrom the end of September to the\nend of January this year.\nMost days the sunshine was\nhot and bright, and it usually\nrained in the early afternoon at\nabout two or three pm local time.\nThere were many bars and discos\nwith chart music or salsa and even\na hippy pub called \"Pobre diablo\"\n(The Poor Devil) with candles and\nrelaxing blue walls where you\ncould drink some great cocktails.\nGenerally only South\nHJ9 FELIX American music is heard on the\nradio and in the buses and houses.\nThey drink rum and coke, or beer\nor if you befriend the locals they\nwill give you some of their punto\nwhich is a very strong spirit that\nthey flavour with cinnamon or\nliquorice (it is actually quite tasty\nand potent enough that the flavour\nsoon becomes unimportant).\nIn Quito the buses have a tv\nand video, so that you can watch\nthe news as you travel through the\ntown. I was very lucky because I went with a couple of\npeople^ \u00b0fr j end ly to women and it\nusually obvious that you are a foreigner. There are jumpers,\nponchos, shirts, hammocks and\nbags and other arte sani as, few of\nJMtfairh the locals wear or use.\nWe had\n\"the men are often very jabs before\n|ye went.

The\npeople were very friendly,\nalthough the men are often\nfriendly to women and It could be\ndaunting to a woman on her own,\nif she was unsure where sn|f|l| as\ngoing.\nPeople do get mugged,\nparticularly if they are carrying a camera or have been seen to pull\nout an inflated wallet. The wages\nthere are a great deal lower than\nin the West and even if you do not\nthink that you appear rich, it is\nBritish Ainways travel bureaus.\nMoney went further in the\nsouth of the country where prices\nwere half that of Quito and there\nare fewer foreigners. You could\nget a meal for about \u00a32 in Quito\nand \u00a31 in the south.\nBest memory/souvenir: There\nare too many good memories such\nas learning to salsa, swimming in\na tropical river on Christmas Day\nand discovering Quito'sla und ret te;a large room full of women\nand about fifty sinks!\nJenny\ndevices onboard). It was\nsomething of a revelation though. The streets resemble,\nI'm told, Paris,\nwith artistically patterned cobbles,\nfew cars, noT shirt shops, large\nplazas and handsome old buildings\njuxtaposed with ambitious new projects. Unpretentious cafes and\nbars spill onto the streets and the\nwhole place has an optimistic air \u2014\nrefurbishment is everywhere and\nthere is a wonderful lack of advertisements and tacky outlets.\nTime for a little of the Czech Republic's history:\n/J z echo slovakia was formed\nIfc^ shortly after the first World\nWar by gluing together three\nsmaller states, and was under Russian communist control by\n1945. It then drifted along an\nin ore xi ble path of corruption leading to the installation of a tin\npot dictator. However, the country\ndid not fare as badly as it might\nhave, receiving useful Russian\nattention in the capital (such as the\nsubway) and little interference\nelsewhere. Being by definition a Bohemian lot, Prague's population,\nespecially the young, eventually\nmade a bid for independence.\nThey held an all out strike and\nvigil in Wenceslaus Square for days\nuntil the capital was paralysed.\nVaclav Havel, a political prisoner\nand p lag wright, was installed as\npresident and the communist rule\nwas overthrown incredibly peacefully in what is now known as the\nVelvet Revolution. It separated back\ninto Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\nThe capital today is in a fine\nposition, with a liberal and wise\ngovernment, a good infrastructure,\nan artistic attitude and a happy\npopulace. The change so far has\nbeen encouraging, a careful balance\nbetween pleasure and tacky ness, between growth and burgeoning\nexpansion.\nPostcards\nHitching in France\nHitchhiking is dangerous, make\nmistake!

There are many restaurants\nand even the best are affordable.\nCzechs take their main meal at\nlunch times and some restaurants\nare a little reluctant to serve large\nevening meals.

Then there is the well\nknown Pat Pong: the go-go bars\nand clubs welcome all tourist and\nex-pats for friendly entertainment.\nFor the serious club ber, you\ncan find the young, beautiful and\nfashionable at So/ 4, Silom Road,\njust along from Pat Pong. This is\nthe place to hang out, is seriously\ntrendy and you'll find the strangest\nmix of people.

Thailand is very cheap\nso it is possible to over shop and\nhave too much to bring back\nhome. The best time is at the\nweekends at Chatuchak Market. It\nis great for the usual tourist goods\nfound in the Far East, handicrafts,\nantiques, and clothes; Next on the\nlist will probably be MBK (Ma Boon\nKrong), a Thai style chee zy shopping mall. Locals shop here\nfor fashion imports and so it caters\nfor rockers, rappers and the usual\nc lubbers. For sightseers the main\nattraction in Bangkok is the Grand\nPalace; stunning architecture\neverywhere you look, and every\nitem seems to be laid with gold\nleaf. There is a strict dress code in\nthe palace so no shorts or\nminiskirts, otherwise you may end\nup in a long queue for a pair of ill\nfitting jumpsuit trousers. Another\npopular tourist attraction is a river\ntrip on the river Ton, however\ngoing during midday is not the\ncottages piled high with cardboard\nboxes containing plastic toys, the\nboxes stamped 'Made in China'\nand realise that this is where they\ncome from. Industry extends down\nto the person in the street; the\nnotion that everything is made in\nlarge factories entitled 'The\nNumber Thirteen People's Plastic\nFootball Factory' or similar is a fallacy.

Also consider Pattaya:\nmany international travel agents\npromote sex tours to this small\nbeach town which is 2hours from\nBangkok. Krabi has cheap\nbungalows or the exclusive 5 star\nDusit Hotel.

In the\nsri u ller cities the foreigner is still all D ve ii y, ana as such is considered\nfair game for surrounding and\nstaring at; also the treatment you\nreceive from officialdom often\nseems hostile.

It has been\nthe setting for many films, perhaps\nmost notably for the gondola\nchase scene in Moonraker, in\nwhich James Bond (aka Roger\nMoore) powers a high-speed\ngondola through the back-waters\nof Venice, only to change into an\ninflatable-car thing ie and drive\naway to safety.

Most visitors do not actually\nstay in Venice, but at a nearby\ncamp or hotel as I did, and catch a bus and ferry to the city. The ferry\nitself is something of an antique,\nbut does provide excellent views\n(and photo-opportunities) when\nleaving the city near sunset.
