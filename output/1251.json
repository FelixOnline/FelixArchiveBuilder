    "content": "I1&k lO FILM FELIX LYRICAL WAXING SF RPM THE EDITORS... So, our final issue of term. It's kind of sad in a way, because we're clearly not going to be able\nto get you the Two Towers review that we were\nlooking forward to. We wanted to do an entire\nfour page spread on the Christmas TV movie\nofferings. BUT NO!! You ski ving undergraduates\nall want to run off home for festive celebrations\nor something. Bah humbug to the lot of you!\nSemi-seriously though - we sincerely hope\nthat you've enjoyed (or at least been able to\nbear) our mildly insane and incoherent ram-bling s, as well as our inept (but strangely com-for ting) take on movie reviews. We are still yet\nto receive a single complimentary email, but\nwe'll forgive you - mainly because we haven't received any derogatory ones either. So have\ny 'all a fine fun-filled holiday, a cracking new\nyear and best of luck in any exams you may\nhave. 'Till January folks!!\nSi\nWell here we are again, boys and girls...in the\nimmortal words of Slade, IT'S CHRISTMAS!!!\nwhich is always fun. Or filled with pointless\npresents you never wanted in the first place and\ncopious family arguments. Whatever. It is the\nseason of much drunken ess and crap ness of TV.\nGo forth, while away the hours between the\nover consumption of food and sleep with terrible films and cuts ie Spielberg repeats. But don't forget that the New Year is but a sparrow's spit\naway, and we'll be back with a vengeance, irritating you with our vitriolic spouting s and giving\nyou the chance to watch films for free. We are\nstill looking for writers, and hope to be adding\nlots of fun new features, including competitions\nand cool stuff like that. I know we've been saying this for ages, but the Felix editorial meetings\nhave been slightly more traumatic and time-consuming than we initially envisaged. Profuse\napologies and festive fuzzy thoughts.\nLiz\nMR DEEDS STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: RELEASE DATE: ADAM SANDLER, MICHAEL TY LO,W IN DNA RYDER STEVEN BRILL12 A96 MINS OUT ND W Ah, Mr Adam Sandler. Not many men are\nmore hated by most film critics. As far as\nthey're concerned, he's the film equivalent of\nS Club 7 - derivative, formulaic, unoriginal,\nand most infuriatingly, he keeps raking the\nmoney in. Must be those uneducated gutter\npeople who go to see his movies, because\nanyone with a full complement of brain cells\nwould surely rather slide down a banister\nlined with razor blades.\nThe thing is, in the right circumstances -and I'm going out on a limb here - S Club 7\ncan actually be enjoyable, and not just\nbecause Rachel is incredibly fit either. Sure,\nI wouldn't confess to actually owning any of\ntheir music, but if all you're after is a bit of a drunken boogie, there's arguably not much\nbetter. And such is the case with Mr Deeds.\nGo to watch it expecting a profound, thought-Mr Deeds, about to hit someone. You can\nsee it in his eyes\nprovoking experience, and you'll hate it. The\ndeepest thing you'll come out of the theatre\nwondering is if Australian accents that bad\nshould carry the death penalty. However,\ntreat this film as a slice of light entertainment and you might just enjoy yourself.\nAt this point, there would normally be a brief plot summary, but the less said about\nthat the better, so let's just take the opening\nscene. It starts with an octogenarian standing 100m from the summit of Everest, wearing a coat and some goggles. A storm forces\nhis group to turn back, he continues alone,\nand is later found frozen to the summit, from\nwhich he is subsequently removed by he li copter. Now, you're all bright Imperial pe o ple, so I don't need to point out the glaring\ninconsistencies there. But who cares? As\nlong as it's funny - and it is in part this blatant disregard of reality that makes you\nchuckle. It's the Starship Troopers factor;\nwhere something is so bad that it becomes\ngood. Don't get me wrong: some of the gags\nerr on the 'nul points' side of hit and miss,\nand this isn't the new Austin Powers. If\nyou've seen The Waterboy or Happy Gilmore\nyou'll know that Sandler's brand of comedy\nfalls squarely within the slapstick bracket,\nbut there's nothing intrinsically wrong with\nthat. As long as you like goofy humour, that\nis.\nIf there's one thing that this film will be\nnoted for when people look back on it, it will\nprobably be the return to the fold of Winona\nRyder, following her recent extra-curricular\nexploits in court. It would be unfair to judge\nher on a production where character is ation and insightful dialogue are way down the list\nof priorities, but she's certainly a cut above\nthe rest of the cast. Which is not saying\nmuch. At all. But, hey - this is comedy, pe o ple...\nBy no means the best movie of the year.\nHowever, go with no expectations and you\nmay find yourself pleasantly entertained.\nDavid Roberts\nWHAT TO WATCH....

    "content": "FELIX FILM11 JACKASS: THE MOVIE STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: RELEASE DATE: JOHNNY KNOXVILLE, BAM MARGERA, CHRIS PONTIUS JEFF T REMAIN E1BB7 MINS24 TH JANUARY(2003) Jackass the movie - literally a load of bollocks.\nAnd arse s, cocks, tattoos, sick, beer...\nIf you've seen the tv series then you pretty\nmuch have the gist of the film. Johnny Knoxville\ntakes a break from Hollywood schmoozing to\nreunite the Jackass team, and lets them loose\ndoing what they always do but in a bigger, better and grosser way than ever. The sketches are\nnumerous and the pace is such that no jokes\nwear thin. Like the series, the content is a mix\nof visual humour, mindless destruction and idiotically dangerous stunts. Particularly surreal\nand entertaining scenes include a panda-medi-a ted vandalism spree launched in nocturnal\nTokyo and the world's bumpiest tattoo, carried\nout in the back of a jeep being driven off-road\nby Henry Rollins.\nBringing out the S&M voyeur buried deeply\n(or not so deeply) in all of us, this film is addictive and impossible to look away from.\nAlthough you may spend the entire time curling\nup your toes in horror and suppressing your gag\nreflex, you might be surprised at how entertaining the whole thing actually is. Believe me, I wasn't exactly relishing an hour and a half\nwatching overgrown skaters shitting in panda\ncostumes and FlexiToning each other's per-in eum s( at least not on a week night) but still, I have to admit, it was good.\nThis film is definitely one for the boys. That's not to say, of course, that it can't also be\nenjoyed by the fairer sex. Girls, if you can stomach the copious amounts of blood, sick and shit\n(not to mention the inherent homo eroticism), then this film may be just the thing for you to\nget in touch with your (testosterone-ridden-15-year-old) masculine side. If you can't, then the\nfrequent shots of a half naked Johnny Knoxville\n(plus other assorted male body parts) and a fantastic soundtrack will go some way to make you\nfeel better about the cost of the cinema ticket.\nIf you're looking for an intellectual and cerebral\ncinematic experience then Jackass The Movie is\nnot the one for you. But if you want to watch a group of men old enough to know better doing\nHeeere's Johnny...\nwhat any teenage boy worth his skate shoes\ndreams of, then see this film. Just a warning\nthough, if you are a collector of matchbox cars,\nor hold a deep psychological dependency on\nthem, do not see this film. You'll never look at\nskid marks in the same way again.\nChrissie Giles\nSPIDERMAN STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: RELEASE DATE: TD BEY MAGUIRE, WILLEM DA FDE, KlRSTEN DUNST\nSAM RAIMI12 A121 MINS\nOUT NOW DN DVD\nOk, not that I 've had this bloody movie on\norder for six months or anything, but I was\never-so excited when I wearily returned from\n(yet) another day of demonstrating to find my\nproverbial box bulging with at anta lising pack-age. Finally. Finally I could watch the film\nevent of the year. The heir apparent to the billion dollar grossing movie throne. The most\nspecial special effects ever. And Spider-man which was a plus I guess.\nI missed this in the cinemas and haven't really forgiven myself since. Sure, I was working 24/7 trying to write a PhD thesis, but I ask you honestly - is even that worth missing\nthis movie during its time on the big screen?\nWell, suffice to say the box office release of\nSpidey passed me by so I was forced to await\nthe DVD, while determined ly fending off the\ntemptation of a \"pirate\" version which by this\ntime had achieved a circulation close to that\nof the film itself. No camcorder-ta stic experience for me - I needed to see this movie in its\npure, virginal state.\nSo. Yes. I realise it's an overly large preamble (even for a pro rambler like myself) but I felt it necessary to try and give you an insight\ninto just how much I was looking forward to\nwatching this movie.\nShort and simple - its great fun, with a heavy dose of spectacular thrown in. Sam\nRaimi has really set the standard for the coming glut of super-hero flicks (Daredevil, X2,\nThe Hulk) with this excellent adaptation of\nthe Spider-man story.\nThe clothes make th the Spider-man\nRemarkably (in this day and age at least)\ncharacter development is not only present and\ncorrect, it is positively enthralling, to such an\nextent that I found myself going back over the\ninterplay between Tobey Maguire's Peter\nParker and Kirsten Dunst's MJ more than I did\nthe action sequences. Which, as it happens,\nare shockingly good. I do admit that there are\nflaws in the CGI, but they are nowhere near\nas apparent as those that have cropped up in\nother recent blockbusters (Blade II for exam-ple). The comic-book purists have had\n\"issues\" with some features of the adaptation\n(organic web slingers, the costume of Dafoe's Green Goblin to name but two) but I really\ndon't think there's a great deal wrong with\nthis movie. Particular scenes that have\nbecome fast favourites of mine are the excellent back story and the final breathtaking shot\nof Spidey making his way across New York as\nonly he can. If you haven't seen this, add it to\nyour Chrimbo list now - I can't see anyone\nbeing disappointed with this DVD.\nWhich brings me nicely onto the extras.\nNow, not having infinite time to digest these\nnuggets of DVD goodness (owing to the arrival\nof the extended LOTR DVD...) I will have to\nskim over some bits. Two commentaries, the\nusual director plus stars one (great but for\nKirsten Dunst) and one from CGI guru John\nDykstra. There's a few out-takes (no deleted\nscenes), documentaries and screen tests but\nthe stand out piece is the documentary on\nSpidey (the comic-book character), featuring\nsuch luminaries as Stan Lee, Todd\nMacFarlane, Kevin Smith (whose recently\ntrodden ground I happen to worship) ...the\nlist goes on. Anyone who knows more than a touch about comics will recognise this as a stellar cast, all assembled to pay tribute to\nour costumed hero. Great stuff to watch.\nSo, all in all its a pretty damn fine DVD.\nWith LOTR and Episode II competing with it\nfor a place under the Christmas tree it has to\nbe. My only regret is that Stan Lee still hasn't seen a penny from this movie - the genius\nbehind Spidey, The Hulk, The Fantastic Four\nand many, many more instantly recognisable\ncomic-book heroes has been (allegedly)\nstiffed by the film's financier. Which for me\nsours the flavour of the best super-hero film\nyet.\nSi\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "Monsters Of Rock\nWembley Arena\n4 / 5\nNever try and paint your nails on\nthe Metropolitan line: however\nadept you may be, you'd have better luck trying to do so while having particularly violent, passionate\nsex with someone three times\nyour size. However, if you ever get\nthe chance to go and see Alice\nCooper live, take it up: I can't remember the last time that I left\na gig with a smile quite as wide as\nthe one that had spread across my\nface by the time we staggered out\nof Wembley Arena.\nI arrived a fashionably late -well, two hours late isn't too bad -and so missed the first two support acts - the LA Guns and the\nQuireboys - but if the third support act, Thunder were anything\nto go by this was probably a very\ngood thing. The band did seem to\nfit the aging rocker mould fairly\nwell, wearing black and having\ndod gy mullets, but the entire\neffect was ruined when the lead\nsinger minced on stage, looking\nlike in the intervening years\nbetween now and their heyday\nhe'd settled down in Surbiton and\nbecome an accountant. To make\nthings worse they sounded like the\nmutant child of Chesnay Hawkes\nand Jon Bon Jovi... as you can\nimagine most of this set was spent\nat the bar, in a vague attempt to\nkeep what little sanity I had left\nnicely pickled and incapable of\nescape.\nFortunately they didn't hang\naround for too long, and we staggered back into the Arena, still\nclutching a few precautionary\npints, for The Coop'. He really did-n't disappoint, and even made the\ntorture of the previous act worth-while, which is no mean feat I can\nassure you. To be fair, this wasn't really a night of highbrow musical\nappreciation: it was the musical\nequivalent of a nice large lump of\nextra mature cheddar: old and\ncheesy, but really nice with crack-ers. Maybe that's pushing the\nmetaphor a bit far, but I'm sure\nyou get the idea.\nAlice Cooper may have been\ndoing this sort of thing for well\nover 20 years, but he's not lost his\ntouch, and really does know how\nto put on a show: at how many\nother gigs are you likely to see the\nvocalist be executed, resurrected\nFrankenstein-style and then chase\nBritney Spears off stage with a huge axe as a finale? Poison was,\nas expected, the highlight of the\nevening... we were not di sap pointed.\nStraight after this gig, I went to\nsee Bomb 20, at Electrowerkz.\nAfter seeing them about a year\nago, and loving it, but not having\nheard much new material since\nthen I was really disappointed:\ntheir edge had totally gone, and it\nhad drifted from proper evil noise\nand Digital Hardcore into awful\nquasi-industrial hip-hop.\nBastards.\nAlex\nFoo Fighters\nWembley Arena\nThis is the Foo's first arena tour\nin the U.K, and as such they\nhave chosen their support care-fully. Cave In certainly produce\nsome exquisite sounds from\ntheir position on stage finishing\nwith a cover of Led Zepplin's 'Dazed and Confused', but the\nstanding crowd do nothing but\nnod their heads - perhaps saving their energy for the main\nevent.\nI 'll be honest, this isn't the\nfirst time I 've seen the Foo\nFighters. It's not even the\nfourth, so you'd be forgiven for\nthinking I'd seen it all before.\nHowever, I think Dave Grohl\nhimself said it best during a chat\nwith the spectators...\"We try to\nmake every f*** ing show differ-ent\". There is a considerable\namount of truth in this remark.\nFor a start off, I 've never before\nheard the alternate heavy metal\n5/5\nending to 'My Hero', nor the\nsimilarly crafted interlude during\n'Stacked Actors'.\nThese are not the most\nnotable pointers towards Grohl's time with Queens of the Stone\nAge though. In fact if you closed\nyour eyes during renditions of\nsome of the new material you'd be hard pushed to remember\nyou hadn't wandered into the\nwrong venue...still, the Foo's inimitable style gives it the hallmarks of a classic Foo fighters\nconcert, complete with\ngrotesque belching into the\nmicrophone.\nIn truth this is turning into\n(another) very special Foo's con-cert. They play a lot of older\ntracks I 've never heard live\nbefore including 'Aurora' to kick\noff the encore, along with the\nnew tracks such as 'The One',\n'Times like These' and 'Tired'\nwhich fit in effortlessly amongst\nthe familiar. The whole experience is one of the best gigs I 've\nbeen to.\nAnd just if you thought it\ncouldn't get any better, 'Monkey\nWrench' kicks in and Dave goes\nwondering. Not just down to the\nbarriers in front of the stage -heck, that's been done before.\nThis time Dave pays a visit to\nthe multitude in the stalls.\nPicking his way along he selects\na spot that towers over the mob\nstanding below, (also, conveniently, straight in front of where\nI was sitting - I have the photos\nto prove it) and serenades them.\nThe crowd seem to jump for\ndear life to Grohl's every note..\nSo what if this was the fifth time\nI 've seen them? There's only one\nthing to say when it come to the\nFoo Fighters \"/ won't go getting\ntired of you\". Alison\nAthlete\nJoel Pott, Carey Willetts, Steve\nRoberts and Tim Wanstall - better know to some as the delectable ATHLETE - are four\nLondon lads bringing sunshine\nto the masses.\nAthlete have been working\nhard this year radiantly filling\nthe support slots for the likes of\nMercury-nominated Electric\nSoft Parade and the all-singing,\nall-dancing, all-tunic-wearing\nPolyphonic Spree.\nThe forthcoming album has\nalready been written and should\nnow have been mixed and otherwise completed for its release\nin a few months time.

    "content": "My Computer\nThe Monarch\n3/5\nThe Monarch at Camden is a great place for indie music. The\nlittle venue of Camden began to\nbe fill with a crowd of fans,\nfriends and curious people.\nThe four members seemed to\ndo their best in their allocated\ntime, 45 minutes and not\nmore...It was impressive to see\nthe crew of the Monarch change\nthe stage between two sets.\nBands helped them and you saw\nall that people plugging key-boards, trying to get their gui-tar... It seemed to be done without organisation but it was efficient! And here were My\nComputer on stage. Not less\nthan seven keyboards, a drum\nand guitars: the combo couldn't move, there was no space left.\nI only knew one track from\nthe band, which was released,\non a HMV playlist this summer.\nMoreover I was curious to see\nthe band that some people compare to Radiohead for the Kid\nA/ Amnesiac period.\nIt is true that the mix of electronica, vo coders, and strange\nnoises reminds you of\nRadiohead. But at the same\ntime it is far from Radiohead!\nHowever, we are quickly\nentranced by this chilled music,\nvery peaceful, which is quite\nunusual for the Monarch. The\nsinger is very focused on his job,\nit is an important tour for the\npromotion of their record\n'Vulnerabilia'.\nPerhaps they are too serious,\nforgetting that they play live and\nnot in a studio...Obviously not\nused to playing live, the band\njust reproduce the album and\nnot more.\nI was waiting for something\nbetter but it's a new band we\nhave to leave them time. It was\na good concert music musically\nbut I regret that the band, didn't make it something spectacular.\nMike\nBritish Sea Power\n93 Feet East\n5/5\nI am going to tell you about a very strange evening...\nAll began when I arrived at the\n93 feet east venue to see British\nSea Power. After a little queue at\nthe entrance, I listened to the\nfirst band: 4 young guys on\nstage who played a strong punk-rock closer of the Sex Pistols\nthan Blink 182. I am not a fan\nof this kind of music but they\nseem to made the concert of\ntheir life, jumping around the\nstage, giving their all, whereas\nthere was nobody in the place.\nAfter this, I was waiting for\nsomething similar for the second\nband called Florida. Not at all, I was firstly surprised to see a Yamaha keyboard on an iron\ntable with plastic tulip lights. It\nwas a totally different atmosphere than the former band...\nAnd it began 2 boys and a girl\nwho was performing in front a half-full venue. It is hard to\ndescribe the style of music: perhaps a kind of easy listening.\nSometimes CD flew over the\nspectators or the singer stopped\nhis song to dance with the girl at\nthe keyboard... It was an unusual performance for sure and it\nwas nothing compared to the\nnext band! At ten, 93 feet east\ncrews started to prepare the\nstage for British Sea Power,\nthey placed some bits of tree,\nfoliage, plastic owls and herons.\nI thought I was in a forest\nbecause of the smell of fresh cut\ntrees.\nSuddenly, they cut off the light\nand a communique introduced\nthe band: \"once placed upon the\nconcert stage they are remarkable in their actions - quick of\nfoot and unafraid in their move-ment s.\" Strange, isn't it?\nAnd five guys arrived dressed\nin quasi-military uniforms, there\nwere the four members: Yan on\nvocals and guitar his brother\nHamilton on bass, Noble on guitar and Wood on drums plus an\nother guy who engaged songs\nwith \"hubbubs\".\nBritish Sea Power plays indie-rock music with heavy guitar\nand drums. It sounds good and I spent great time to see them.\nBut I think I will long remember\nthe end of the concert: the band\nbegan to fight with the bits of\ntree, one guy on a loudspeaker,\nHamilton on shoulders of his\nbrother fighting with Noble and\nWood who continued to play\ndespite the chaos around him. I had never seen such a disaster\nafter a gig. The stage was totally destroyed, everything was at\nthe wrong place: the plastic\nheron on the drums, foliage\neverywhere and guitars among\nbits of tree.\nIn conclusion, even if you\ndon't like this style of music, you\nhave to see British Sea Power\nlive because they have an attention to details and a big sense of\nshow.\nMike\nThank you for reading our\nhallowed pages. Hope you all\nhave a very merry Christmas,\nand I hope to see you all here\nin the New Year. Sajini\nSingles\nRikki and Daz - Rhinestone\nCowboy\nThis record is comedy genius. If\nthere is any justice in the world,\nthis will be Christmas number 1\nthis year. What is this musical\nepiphany? I hear you cry. Well.\nTo try and explain, these are\na couple of Northern lads, who\nstate PJ and Duncan as huge\ninfluences on their work. They\nare pioneers of 'scum pop' which is, in their own words\n'pop music made by Northern\nScum for Northern Scum.' Oh\nyeah, and it features Glen\nCampbell. Only the most\nseverely depressed students will\nnot have a giggle at this. Buy it\nnow.\n5/5 Sarah\nMew - She Came Home Fo,\nChristmas\nSuch is the bliss ed out nature\nof acts from Scandanavia, you\nsometimes wonder if the people there really are living in a Utopian state. From Royksopp\nto Kings Of Convenience and\nSoundtrack Of Our Lives to\nSigur Ros; all the bands seem\nto produce music which you\naspire to live your life to. I have\nto report that Mew have nothing to do with either Pokemon\nor the keyboardist from\nElastica. Instead, this seasonal\noffering gives a nod to '60s west coast bands along with\nthe melancholy of Smashing\nPumpkins and REM.\nThe jarring point is the shaky\nbaritone vocals it uneasily\nmixes with a sparse backing\nand confused lyrics of lost love.\nFrom this song, you sense they\ndon't quite have the eye for a tune like their peers, although\na few more listens allows this\nstrange cacophony to gel.\nAfter a spell in hibernation,\nlet's hope these creatures\ncome back with something to\nroar about!\nDeepesh\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SCIENCE09 We did go to the moon - part II\nApparently some of you were not satisfied with\nmy previous article debunking the various\nmoon hoax theories. That article was mainly\nbased around the photographic \"evidence\" that\nwe did not go to the moon. In this article I will\nlook at some of the other \"proofs\" that we\ncould not have been there. I will start by looking at some of the theories surrounding lunar\ndust.\nOne of the commonly asked questions is\n\"why doesn't the dust stay in the air longer\nthan on the Earth? Surely with the lower gravity it would float around for ages?\"\nOn the moon there is a vacuum and dust\ndoes not float in a vacuum - it will fall very\nquickly. On Earth the atmosphere causes dust\nto blow around despite the stronger gravity,\nbecause an atmosphere has a stronger effect\non the motion of dust than gravity. There is\nnowhere on Earth where dust could behave\nthis way, so the film of the lunar landing could\nnot be faked on Earth.\nAnother question often asked is \"why does\nthe dust clump together like wet sand?\nEverybody has seen the pictures of the astro-naut s' footprints but should the dust have left\nany trace of the footprints? Would they not\nhave disappeared like footprints in dry sand\ndunes?\"\nLunar dust particles have not been subject to\nweathering processes like they would be on\nEarth, so they are smaller and more irregular.\nThey are a product of asteroid collisions and so\nare tiny jagged shards of broken rock that have\nnot been smoothed off because there is no\n\"weather\" on the moon. As a result they would\nnot have been compressed by the boots of the\nastronauts. Instead they gripped together and\nLunar footprint - why does it look like it was\nmade in wet sand?\nretained their shape, hence the \"wet sand\"\nappearance of the footprints.\nNow I will discuss supposedly the most convincing argument of the moon hoax theorists -that of the Van Allen radiation belt: \"The Van\nAllen belts are a band of concentrated radiation around the Earth. It's been estimated that\nyou'd need a foot of lead casing to protect\nyourself from this, which the Apollo crafts did-n't have. Why didn't this kill the astronauts on\nthe way to the moon?\"\nThe Van Allen radiation belt concentrates\nradiation in space to surround the Earth and\nthe Apollo crafts had to go through this belt\nand could not take the weight of all the lead\nshielding with them. So yes the astronauts\nwere exposed to radiation, but how serious\nwas this exposure?\nCalculations show that travelling through the\nVan Allen belt would expose astronauts to 1\nrem of radiation. It takes 25 rem for a person\nto exhibit symptoms of radiation sickness and\n100 rem before they get really ill, so the Apollo\nastronauts had a pretty mild dose. They considered that the experience of going to the\nmoon was worth taking a risk for. However it is\ntrue that the issues related to radiation will\nhave to be solved before any attempts at long\nterm space travel are made.\nHopefully even the more sceptical of you are\nnow convinced that we did go to the moon. I invite any \"unbelievers\" to write a convincing\nscientific article to go in these pages, if you still\nthink that I am wrong.\nFor more information see: http://www.red ze ro.demon.co.uk/moon hoax/ Rosie Chandler\nIC Scientist Profiles\n#3 George P Thomson (1892 -1975)\nGeorge Paget Thomson was the\nson of the famous Physicist and\nNobel Prize winner Sir JJ Thomson, who discovered the\nelectron. George was born in\nCambridge in 1892, where his\nfather was Professor of Physics at\nthe university. He later graduated\nfrom Trinity College, Cambridge,\nand immediately went to work for\nhis father until war broke out in\n1914.\nDuring the First World War\nGeorge worked mainly on problems related to aircraft stability for\nvarious institutions. When the war\nended he briefly was a Fellow and\nLecturer of Corpus Christi College\nin Cambridge before being\nappointed Professor of Natural\nPhilosophy at the University of\nAberdeen, where he stayed for\neight years. During his time in\nScotland George\nThomson carried\nout work on the\nbehaviour of\nelectrons incident on thin\nmetal films. It\nwas this work,\nwhich showed\nthat electrons\ncould exhibit\nwave like behaviour as well as\nparticle behaviour, that earned\nhim a Nobel\nPrize in Physics,\njointly with CJ Davisson of the Bell Telephone\nLaboratories. It is ironic, perhaps,\nthat JJ Thomson received a Nobel\nPrize for saying that the electron\nwas a particle, whereas his son\nreceived a Nobel\nPrize for saying\nthat the electron\nwas a wave.\nThomson was\nappointed a Professor at\nImperial College\nin 1930, where\nhe stayed until\n1952 when he\nwent back to\nCorpus Christi\ncollege until his\nretirement in\n1962. At\nImperial Thomson worked\non nuclear physics and after the\ndiscovery of uranium fission in\n1939 he started to carry out\nexperiments researching into its\nmilitary applications.\nAfter war broke out again\nThomson went to work for the\nRoyal Aircraft establishment and\nthen was made chairman of the\nBritish Committee investigating\ninto the possibility of an atomic\nbomb. The committee established\nthat a bomb was possible and\nThomson went to work as\nScientific Liaison officer at Ottawa\nwhere he kept in touch with the\nAmerican atomic bomb research.\nAfter the war Thomson worked\nat Imperial doing theoretical\nresearch into obtaining nuclear\npower from deuterium. This work\nwas concluded at the Associated\nElectrical Industry's Research\nLaboratories where Thomson\nbecame a consultant.\nFor more information see the\nNobel e Museum.\nRosie Chandler\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

I therefore see no point in\nspending time and money on\nmaking the LEQ's completely safe\nand geeky hack proof. My reasoning is that no-one outside Imperial\ngives a shit about our LEQs, they\nprefer more challenging and interesting targets. Also Imperial stu-dents, rather than priding themselves on proving how good their\nhacking is against poorly defended\ntargets, should be filling the forms\nin instead.

Our previous meeting saw us snatch three\npoints at their ground against the\nrun of play, so this time they were\nsuitably pissed off and ready for\nsome bloodshed.\nThe match started under a storm of controversy, with their\ncaptain claiming his team was\nplaying \"under duress\" as the referee was not official. Still, the\ngame got underway, and right\nfrom the start we signalled our\nintentions to dominate with Alex\nand Dom initiating flowing moves\ndown the wings, and with Matt\nand Dan solid in defence.\nAfter 10 minutes we took the\nlead, with a sweet passing move\nresulting in Dom smashing the\nball past the flailing keeper. After\nthis they got more pissed off and\nstarted coming back into the\ngame, with crunching tackles flying in on Simone and in particular\ncaptain Henry, but by the end of\nthe half we were back in control\nand looking good.\nWe started the 2nd half the\nway we finished the 1st. Frenchy\nwas everywhere in midfield, and\nthe pace of Chris and Simone\nworried their sluggish back line.\nSoon our superiority paid divi-d ends, with a cross whipped in by\nAlex resulting in Chris popping up\nat the near post for a rare headed\ngoal. After this we got complacent\nand they pulled one back.\nThis inspired them to claim\nthat we were \"worse than Barts\",\nwhich we were unimpressed by,\nand made this clear by proceeding to outplay them all over the\npitch. Jim came on for Frenchy,\nand Henry started to make skilful\nruns through their midfield. They\nnever really looked like they\nwould pull it back, and 10 minutes before the end Simone\nscored a sweet tap in to make it\n3-1 to us.\nIn conclusion, they weren't very\ngood, we were better and so won\ndeservedly, our eyes now firmly\nset on our BUSA group top spot.\nOn Wednesday afternoon,\nHackney Marshes provided a platform for Imperial's most\nactive to retain their University of\nLondon Cross Country crown.\nDefying the weather, we\narrived to find a course devoid of,\nwell, everything - no mud, no\nhills no nothing. This is not necessarily a good thing in cross-country, as it usually tends to\nmean that everyone just runs\nfaster. Several laps of a suspiciously football pitch shaped\ncourse later and the places were\ndecided. Imperial's men - Dave\nMulvee, Ollie Thwaites, Andy\nGreenway and Chris Mullingtonfinished first from the University\nof London, holding off Royal\nHolloway to take gold. The second team only just finished outside the medals, coming in 4th. IC's women's team - Emma\nCalderbank, Louise Dulley and\nMinna Kane - stormed home to\nwin the women's competition\nfrom King's and LSE, for the first\ntime in living memory!\nThe day was pretty much completed with Dave also taking\nbronze in the men's race, though\nhe swapped the awards presentation for the pub and his medal\nis still in Hackney. The Champs\nwere run as part of the fourth\nLondon Colleges League race,\nand both men and women have\nnow soared to the giddy heights\nof the top three, with two races\nto go. A good turnout always\nhelps the cause, so in the (some-what unlikely) event that any of\nthis has inspired you you'd be\nmore than welcome to turn up on\nWednesday at 1pm in the Union\nfor a jog in Hyde Park.\nIn other news, four ULU teams\nwent to the Luton Marathon\nRelays and came back with\nthree trophies. A confusing lack\nof opposition - or maybe we're\njust improving - meant that the\nmen's team - all from Imperialfinished first.

    "content": "FELIX NIGHTLIFE19^' fe fr NightLife\nProgression Sessions\nMonthly @ The End\nFriday, midnight. I 've been standing outside\nThe End for about forty five minutes now\nwith two free guest list places (cheers eds!)\nto the Progression Sessions - the night which\nintroduced me to London drum 'n' bass and\nwhich features the man himself - LTJ Bukem.\nDescribed by his label as \"the living\nembodiment of the post-acid house entrepreneurial creative spirit\" he is accompanied\ntonight by his \"Good Looking\" colleagues -the more than able Nookie, Makoto and MC\nConrad. This leaves me in no doubt that I will\nbe witnessing some general magnificence.\nI am not disappointed - Bukem plays a fantastic set and keeps me on my feet and moving for a good couple of hours (a feat which\nmany people have failed at in the past).\nUnfortunately, I didn't wait around to see\nGoldie, who cut his set from two hours to one\nhour at 4 a.m. for some undisclosed reason.\nI left with this message in my head for you:\nif you like jazz, soul or drum 'n' bass, then\nget your ears, your heart, your hands and\nyour feet down to the Progression Sessions as\nsoon as possible.\nDan Bush\nFriday 13th December\nLTJ Bukem, Nookie, Five Alive\nThe End\n16A West Central St, WC1A\n\u00a310 members, \u00a312 guests/NUS\nwww.the-end.co.uk\nKinkymalinki\nMonthly @ Various\nBefore you even get through into the main\nroom you're struck by the beauty of the\nplace. An immaculately decorated entrance\nis staffed by possibly the most attractive\nbouncers ever. Once inside it gets even bet-ter. Everybody is beautiful, even the least\nattractive people could be models.\nIn such a beautiful venue it could be easy\nto feel out of place but nobody does, everybody looks at home here. The main room is\nfull of leather seating, oak panels and plants\nand is filled by an impressive sound system\nwith a gorgeous mix of deep, soulful and\nvocal house (and a man on bongos !!). Its a very easy going, friendly atmosphere.\nUpstairs in the smaller Room 2, equipped\nwith a big leather bed, things are pretty\nmuch the same but with a few more breaks,\na bit more funk and a bit more attitude.\nIt's a little on the expensive side but completely worth it because you are not likely to\nbe surrounded by as many beautiful people\nagain in such a plush environment without\njoining some ridiculous members club. Its\ncertainly an experience.\nDad\nSaturday 7th December\nJay Friction, Sharp Boys, Space Brothers\nAquarium\n256-260 Old Street, EC1\n\u00a312 members, \u00a315 guests\nwww.club aquarium. co.uk\nEditorial\nHere we are again then kids, the end of the\nfirst term. Doesn't time fly when you're having fun?\nIt seems like only yesterday that all the\nfresher s were arriving, looking lost and wondering if there was anything better to do\naround here than the Union or Hombres.\nThen they picked up their first copy of Felix\nand as they were carelessly flicking through\nit they came across these hallowed pages.\nSuddenly, life seemed to take on some mean-ing, there came the realisation that there was\nin fact a lot to do in London and that most of\nit was amazing, something for all tastes. Full\nof youthful exuberance and joy at their new\nfound knowledge they went out and they partied hard. Then, after flooding our inbox with\nreviews of where they had been they went\nout and they partied some more.\nOK, maybe that last bit was made up, and\nsome of the middle bits were possibly fabricated as well, and we may have overestimated our influence slightly, but they were definitely looking lost. We do hope though, that\nwe have at least provided you with an idea\nand a taste of what London has to offer, that\nis what we're here for after all.\nThis term has been pretty amazing for\nclubbing and the new year promises to be no\nexception. So go forth, \"have it large\", report\nback to us with all your New Year stories and\nwe'll see you in January with more reviews,\nmore competitions, more fun and many more\nrandom ramblings.\nRemember kids,\n\"it's about the music\"\nTim and Dom\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk \"...it's like getting a personal visit, from God ! \"\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT FELIX Virgins Creamed LoSErs\nLadies Rugby\nIC Virgins I1014 Royal Vets\nWhat a blinding match! We really\nweren't sure what to expect from\nthis friendly, especially having lost\ntwice to the Vets last season.\nThe Virgins were a bit slow off the\nmark, conceding two early tries, due\nto crap tackling and a general lack\nof with-it-ness. These were combined with conversions by their Big\nFat Ugly prop, who was to be fair a good kicker. For the rest of the\nmatch, however, we held them back\nand really took the game to them.\nOur first try was off a penalty, with\nAoife passing it to Gemma who ran\nblind through at least three tackles,\nbut was unable to sidestep the last\ndefender and off loaded the ball to\nAoife who put it down over the line.\nThe next try came in the second\nhalf after a maul practically on their\ntry line. Ella - who was forward of\nthe match again - placed herself just\nout of the mall waiting for the pop\npass. When it eventually came she\npowered over the line to glory... oh\nyes, there was much glory.\nOur open play was good and flu-ent, especially amongst the backs,\nwhat with our ringer and all. If we\nalways played this well we'd be winning our league hands down.\nSo, to the gossip. Ella, our blond\nprop, who seems perfectly innocent\nbut is really a sly dog - you've got to\nwatch the quiet ones - crossed to\nthe dark side last week to pull a certain footballer. I'm informed he's called Barry, and that he may be a hand me down from the infamous\nAleks Corr, but who isn't these days?\nShiner number three of the season is worn by Gaffa Charlotte\n'Muttley' Miller. Pre match frolicking\nled to a knee in the cheekbone from\nSpatchcock. To compound the\ninjury a ball came straight off their\nfly half's boot into her face, causing\nbruising and a bloody nose.\nIn order to raise their reputations\nAsh has requested that she be\ncalled Lush, and Dappy would like\nto point out how beautiful she is.\nYou can't say we don't try!\nFitzpatrick are proud sponsors of Imperial College Rugby Club\nSports Shorts\nLadies Hockey\nIC II 6 - 0 Essex\nAnother outstanding performance\nfrom the ladies seconds. We dominated the game and ran rings\nround the opposition. Our goalie\nYsanne only had to move three\ntimes during the game: once to\nsave their one shot - when a rogue\nball dribbled into the D once to\nchange ends at half time, and\nonce to leave at the end.\nJenny and Ana scored two of\nour six fabulous goals in the first\nhalf, but in the second we really\nbegan to shine. A superb strike\nfrom Ashleigh bounced off a defenders foot and landed in the\ngoal. This was followed up by\nClare with a goal from the top of\nthe D, which was set up beautifully by Kate. Marianne then\nmade a fast drive up the wing to\nmake it five nil, and then Ashleigh\nfinally took us up to six.\nWell done to all the backs,\nSarah, Katherine, Belinda and\nBrenda, who fielded back into our\ngoal end and saved Ysanne from\ndoing too much work.\nFinally thanks to John and\nGibbo for gimp ing for us - cheers\nguys.\nLadies Hockey\nIC II 0 - 6 Kings II\nWe don't do ULU cup!\nLadies Hockey\nIC II 2 - 0 Goldsmiths\nTrue champions.\nThanks for all your reports this\nterm: we've printed every single\none that's been submitted - I think - so keep them coming\nnext term.\nI know there are far more\nteams playing than there are\nreports printed, so those of you\nthat aren't writing, get to it!\nAlex\nJPITZrATIUCK\nCHi AT lV fCO ItS Tft UC T lOU Rugby\nLSE I1023 IC I Despite Mo's efforts to lead us\ndown the long and winding road\nto Harlington, we all had suspicious minds about the absence of\nchunky Dune. So, two tribes go to\nwar, we all made sure not to look\nback in anger at the ref who was\ngoing slightly mad when he\nthought that our coach was just\nan over competitive dad. Jon's charged down kick was followed\nup by Bobby who ran like a bat\nout of hell to score.\nAfter sustained IC pressure, the\nLSE flanker lost the plot and started kung fu fighting (but not quite\nas fast as lightning). Fortunately\nthe ref was not colour blind and\nshowed him the yellow card. The\nIC pack took full advantage of the\nextra man and after pushing it...\npushing it real good, Enrico\ncrashed over in the corner. LSE\nwere knocked down but they got\nback up again and scored a try\njust before half-time to leave IC\nwith a slender 3 point advantage.\nIn the second half, with the\nwind beneath our wings, we\nsearched for the heroes inside\nourselves and demonstrated\namazing defence. After some fantastic running lines from the\nbacks, Mo drove over to touch\ndown for the very first time this\nseason. Despite Rich Waller's one\nvision chip, the backs showed\ntrue class and man-of-the-match,\nAlex James weaved his way\nthrough with pointed wings after\ngood hands from Mark and\nTimplicity. Enrico, the dancing\nqueen, then scored his second try\nto complete the rout.\nSome might say we are simply\nthe best - except Will who wasn't sure if we had won or not.\nLive foot bal on the Bl* imperial\n' \u2022 \u2022 college\nunion \\i irk \\'l \u2022* Imperial\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 college\nunion\nCHARING CROSS BAR\n(WEEK DAYS ONLY)\nSat 7th December\n12\u202215pm Man Utd v Arsenal\n83\u00a9pin Seville v Real Sociedad\nSun 8th December\n4pm Tottenham v W.B*A.6 pm Mallorca v Real Madrid\nTues 10th December\nMem Utd v la Coruna 7.45pm Hied 11 th December\nArsenal v Valencia 7.45pm Thurs 12th December\nLiverpool v V.

    "content": "MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX ShyFX and T Power\nSet It Off\nAlbums & Single\n4 / 5\nKnown for bringing Drum and\nBass to the mainstream last year,\nShyFX and T Power return with\nanother slice of urban life. And\nbelieve me, after listening to\nthem, you have the most affable\ndance album since the Artful\nDodger's 'It's All About the\nStragglers'.\nSetting it off with Intro, is the\nsurprise inclusion of chart RnB\nstyle MC versus girl ie vocals from\nFallacy, which sticks out like a sore thumb in an array of party-friendly urban tracks. The first\nhighlight, is track two, the famous\n'Shake Your Body'. It's infectious,\nit's catchy, and irresistible to\ndance to, 'those garage tunes are\nso fine, they just blow my mind'.\nThis is what Lonyo should've\nmade!\nSpanish guitars and salsa beats\nbring in the infamous Kele Le\nRoc, of lisp, limp ballads and\nmadonna piercing fame. Her\ntrademark breathy vocals, showcased back in 98, and on\nDamage's 'Maria' are conspicuously absent in this irresistible\ntrack,'Feelin' You' displaying her\ntrue vocal talents. A jazz band\nover shifting drums being in the\nmost 'garage' track on the album,\n'Calling'. And this is about as\nunderground as it gets, garage to\nchill out to. There's more of where\nthat came from on 'Don't Wanna\nGive a Damn', another laid-back,\nfunky tune.\n'Shake UR Body' Part II arrives\non 'Don'f Wanna Know', a good\nenough effort, but overly reminiscent of track two. Luckily, 'I 've Got\nan Idea' with it's sexy vocals\narrives, and leaves, to distract me\nfrom this. I even find myself\nsinging along, and it ends, cruelly,\nI think, just as it gets going. Ragga\ncomes on the scene, in the form of\nElephant Man, and successfully\njuxtaposes itself next to the sexy\nsounds of Damage's resident\nsmoothie, Coree Richards (barf!\n:P). Thankfully, Coree's vocals are\nas hardcore as his endless, rippling torso. He gives us a clear\nindication of where Sean Escoffery\nshould be, where Lifford David left\noff, and where Lynden David Hall\nwants to be.\nThe album falls flat from this\npoint on. Only the interlude from\nFabio, with his passable yet amusing Del Trotter impression and the\nlast track, 'Everything' a chilled-out masterpiece that every self-respecting MOS album should\nhave, saves the day, but only just.\nOnly just. By the skin of it's teeth,\nthis album just about makes it\ninto my top ten of the year.\nSajini\nBlondie\nGreatest Hits\n4 / 5\nSo it's Christmas time - let's cash\nin. This is probably why this new\ncompilation, which follows in an\nextremely long line of Blondie hits\nand remix albums. I start to wonder if the band is benefiting or\nhurting from this constant stream\nof such albums. But okay, why am\nI here? To review the album itself.\nPackaged rather nicely, with\npictures of the band at their\nprime, it contains some well\nresearched liner notes by Steve\nPafford. The selection itself?\nActually pretty well paced, I nice\nmix of albums tracks and hit sin-g les, with all the famous songs\nrepresented - 'Atomic', 'Heart Of\nGlass', 'Rapture', 'Call Me', 'One\nWay or Another' and 'The Tide is\nHigh'. Having not having listened\nproperly to Blondie before, and\nhaving heard cover versions of\n'Call Me' and 'The Tide is High', I have to admit the covers outdo\nthe originals, partly because they\nseem to have more energy (especially in Nikka Costa's version of\n'Call Me') in comparison to Debbie\nHarry's cool y reserved vocals. The\nactual song the Kittens almost\nmurdered is markedly superior to\nthe cover, giving the reggae beat\nand trumpet playing first preference over Harry's vocals.\nThe rest of the album, is\nstraight-forward, good-time guitar-pop. Songs like 'One Way Or\nAnother' and 'Maria' show\nHarry's versatility as a vocalist,\nworking effectively against the\nalmost dance-able background.\nShe does menacing, dangerous,\ntough, tender and plaintive equally well, as we see on 'Heart of\nGlass' and 'Denis'. The songs are\nenjoyable, twenty-five years later,\nbut as there's been a lot of newer,\nheavier guitar and dance music,\nthey don't stand up in my opinion\nas well as they should do according to how Blondie are perceived\nas legends in the eyes of older lis-ten ers. However, they keep selling\nwell these days, and that's one of\nthe testaments of Blondie's music,\nits endurance. Sajini\nSingles\nAvril Lavigne - Skater Boi\nExcellent stuff this. Real\ngenius, real audio brilliance:\n\"He was a Skater boy, said see\nyou later boy\"\nOne of the diamond pivots in\nthe cocktail of everything\nunmusical and wrong. I concede that the talent that is Avril\nLavigne is of very specific taste\nand that as such it should not\nbe reviewed next to anything\npassable as music. However\nsince Felix has not been allocated space for a \"Rare Arts\" page,\nthis is where you are condemned to read about them.\nThe one thing I can say about\n'Skater Boi' is that it is upbeat.\n- I guess to some people this\nmaybe uplifting or an the mic. Probably not though, I really\ncouldn't see that being the case\n- instead I think the phrase\nuncomplicated \"chick rock\" will\nhave to suffice. Imagine a run of\nthe mill Blink 182 song, but\nwith a girl singing and less\nthought put in.\n0/5 Sach\nWyclef Jean feat. Tom JonesPussycat\nTaken from the current album\nMasquerade, Wyclef has this\ntime teamed up with the ol'\nunderwear king himself to produce a dismal hip hop remix of\nWhat's new Pussycat? In, his\nattempt to be eclectic, or\nec left ic( his previous album\ntitle), this ex-fu gee seems to\nhave forgotten that he also\nneeds to produce a decent\nrecord. In desperate attempts\nto fill the colossal void between\neach chorus (the Tom Jones\nsample), 'clef raps about 'g he t to cats, alley cats, freaky cats,\nkit kat s' whilst stressing the\nimportance of 'paying child\nsupport to your kittens'.\n1/5 Radha\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk It's comforting to know that someone who messes with you has a strong chance of being born a sea cucumber\n\n"

    "content": "It's been a busy week really. Working all the\nhours the Gods have sent and more is no fun,\nwhich I why I don't do it all that often, but sometimes you just don't have a choice.\nI do have to say though, that the \"artists\nimpression of a Champagne Breakfast\" in the\nlast article is complete bollocks. If there's ever\nbeen any Wye champagne breakfasts that tidy\nthey must have been fakes. I also have to make\nan apology to Ben \"Charmer\" Palmer. Apparently\n\"the Charmer is now the Calmer this year\". Sorry\nBen.\nI 've been asked to explain a few little things\nabout the main drinking clubs we have here.\nThis could be dangerous. Now. Do I be nice or\ndo I be the cow everyone knows me to be? I 've\nnever been the nicest person so I 'll go for being\na bitch. It's more natural.\nStarting with the JSF then. Jock Strap\nFarmers. Fucking n utters. Dirty bastards. Can be\ngentlemen when they want to be though. Can\nalways be recognised by the green and gold\njumpers, grandfather-type white vests, usually\nwith complimentary stains down them and green\nties. Lovely. Usual haunts are the Union s lagging off the Garters, any local pubs and the Josh.\nInitiation involves loads of alcohol (of course),\nmaking a mess, drinking piss and a goldfish.\nThis club generally consists of the loudest\n\"gents\" in the place who consider a night a good\none only if they have absolutely no idea what the\nhell happened. Potential members have to be\nCOLUMN Wye 'Sup\nloud, arrogant, have a book of bad jokes ready to\nhand and an ability to consume twice as much\nas the rest of the clubs put together.\nNext, the Beaus. When not up their own arse s, the Beaus (all two of them at the moment) are\nusually found in the Union having \"a few quiet\ndrinks\" and any clubs that Ben \"do you know\nwho I am\" Palmer hasn't been banned from\n(Sorry Ben, but I have to be brutal. Love you\nreally). Always recognised by the turned up\nnoses, smart suits and bow ties, the Beaus are\nthe complete opposite of the JSF. General lady\nkillers, but always well turned out and nice to the\nBar Staff. Initiation involves fire, a brandy glass\nand considerable amounts of pain. Aspiring\nBeaus are recognisable as being highly cultured,\ncivilised and usually alcoholic gentlemen.\nThe Garters are always well dressed too.\nRecognised by the garter round the left leg (I think) and bottles of Passoa or Malibu, they usually start in the Union and work on to the clubs\nafter a few bottles of wine. Can't really w hinge FELIX about the Garters. Nice girls, but just don't get\non the wrong side of them. From past experiences though, they can be a bit dangerous.\nPotential candidates need to have a good friendship with a good wine and be able to smell a shopping bargain from 20 feet away.\nThe Druids don't exist, so I have to write about\nthe Meteorological Society. If I told you who was\nin this elite group, I'd have to kill you, if they\ndon't kill me first, so I'd better keep my mouth\nshut on this one. Except to mention that they\nhave a habit of kidnapping anyone they can\nwhich usually pisses the Garters off to no end\nwhilst everyone else just pisses themselves\nlaughing.

REFERENCE\nCOLLECTION\nImperial College and\nScience Museum Libraries\nTop Up Fees Abandoned?\nIn a dramatic about face the government\nappears to have backed down over the issue of\ntop up fees.\nSomewhere between ten and twenty thousand students from all over the country gathered in London on Wednesday to protest the\nfact that the government seemed to be on the\nverge of forcing top up fees upon students, and\nthat evening Tony Blair, the Prime Minister,\nseemingly signalled a drastic policy reversal.\nThis was due, he said, to such a policy possibly\nleading to a divisive and elitist system. It may\nbe closer to the truth, however, that he backed\ndown over growing fears that the issue could do\nto his government what the poll tax did to that\nof Margaret Thatcher.\nThe education secretary, Charles Clarke,\nechoed the words of Tony Blair by stating that\nstudents would only have to pay 'hundreds\nrather that thousands of pounds' upfront. This\nwould certainly put many restrictions on the\ndirection that our Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,\nWestminster U Turn\nmay now take, and strongly implies that the\nplans outlined in the paper that was presented\nto College council a matter of weeks ago will\nhave to be rethought.\nA final decision on the subject is not expected until after the publication of the\nGovernment's much discussed white paper on\nhigher education funding in January, but this is\nthe first clear sign that the government is listening to the concerns of students. It is expected that this paper will - rather than giving the\ngreen light for top up fees as had been feared -suggest the introduction of a graduate tax combined with an extended loans system. This will\nhopefully deal with the financial crisis currently\nfacing our entire higher education system.\nVery few Imperial College students attended\nthe march, with the exception of a large group\nof medical students, reported to number three\nhundred and fifty. The poor attendance has\nbeen blamed on a lack of publicity from the\nUnion, which is believed to be due to the fact\nthat they did not feel that funds should be\ndirected towards an NUS event, after the\nresounding 'No' vote in last year's referendum.\nThis has caused a certain amount of anger\nwithin the student body, as it is felt that the\nissue of fees and student financing should be\ngreater than that of student politics. Alex\nSummer Job Centre\nOver 1000 students passed\nthrough the first ever Internships\nFair held at Imperial College on\nWednesday, organised by the City\n& Guilds College Union Internship\nCentre. Unlike the Careers Fair,\nthe Internships Fair was organised\nentirely by student volunteers and\nwas specifically aimed at non final\nyear students and designed to\nhelp students obtain summer\nplacements rather than jobs after\ngraduation.\nStudents could visit around fifteen stands in the Great Hall with\nthe companies ranging from giants\nsuch as UBS and JP Morgan\nthrough to small engineering firms\nsuch as Energy Scitech as well as\nthe Undergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme (UROP)\nfrom within college. \"This event\nhas been a phenomenal success\nand I'm very pleased with the\nturnout both from students and\ncompanies,\" said C&G Internship\nCentre Co-or d in at or Shrenik Patel.\nThe fair also hosted the launch\nof the Internship Centre (on-line at\nhttp://www.cgc u. net/interns hi ps/)\nthough the presentations by City &\nGuilds College Union President\nSumeet Bhalla and Engineering\nFaculty Principal Professor John\nPerkins were a mixed success\nwith the microphone volume a little low to be heard over the\ncrowd,\nNevertheless, well over 500\nstudents had logged onto the\nInternship Centre site by\nWednesday evening. The site is\ncurrently listing over 150 placements at different companies\nopen to Imperial College students\nwith more expected to be added\nas the year goes on.\nOliver Pell\nAlex gets festive.

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS13 il fo um s& Singles,\n2002 - The Year of the Devil\nReview of the Year\nWhen BBC2 screen 'I Love 2002'\n(it'll probably be on next week) no\ndoubt music will be represented\nby Pop Idol. Perfect smiles and\nsaccharine ballads will be made\nout to have been the flavour of\nthe year, but thankfully, true\nmusic fans know that this vacuous dirge was the low point in\nwhat has been a year full of\ndelights; if you stay away from\nthe charts!\nIn terms of quality releases, the\nyear can be divided into new acts\nand artists who made a successful return. In the former, we saw\nsuperb comebacks from Coldplay,\nDoves, Idlewild, Feeder, Flaming\nLips, JJ72 and Delgados to name\nbut a few. Even David Bowie,\nOasis and Paul Weller showed\nthat they still had something to\noffer.\nThe hype machine was mostly\nspot on this year, with lots of\nexciting new and young bands\narriving on the scene with particular mentions to The Music, The\nCoral, TCTC, ESP, Datsuns,\nJames Yorkston and Polyphonic\nSpree.\nIn the world of metal, QOTSA\nfinally lived up to their potential\nto produce the monstrous 'Songs\nFor The Deaf whilst Foo\nFighters, Audioslave, A and Korn\nalso enjoyed success.\nDance fought back after a somewhat barren 2001. Leading\nthe charge were the chilled-out\nlikes of Lemon Jelly, Boards Of\nCanada and FC Kahuna, along\nwith Royksopp's Melody AM at\nlast getting its due rewards.\nHowever, acts creating new\nwaves included My Computer,\nMedicine8 and Faultline, but\nDavid Holmes and 808 State\nshowed that the old-timers still\nhad a few tricks up their sleeve.\nHip-hop saw sterling efforts\nfrom Herbaliser, The Aspects,\nMissy Elliot and Eminem (twice)\nbut we bid a sad farewell to The\nAnti-Pop Consortium as well as\nTLC and Run DMC after the\ndeaths of Lisa Lopez and Jam\nMaster Jay. Other bands splitting-up included Miss Black America,\nSnow Patrol and Regular Fries,\nas well as us having possibly\nseen the last of Pulp, Cornershop,\nSix By Seven and Charlatans.\nWeird goings-on included\nEminem's spat with Moby, Ozzy\nOsbourne getting a family TV\nshow, the making of the new Blur\nalbum and anything involving\nMicheal Jackson.\nHowever, it was Pop Stars that\ngave us the musical highlight of\nthe year. Hearsay announcing\nthat they would be splitting up\nbecause they were sick of being\ncalled wan kers by small children\non the street! Perhaps a sign that\npeople are tiring of production-line puppets and want music with\nsome substance. Here ,we have\nhigh hopes for 2003.\nDeepesh\nVarious\nBoom Selection 2\n3/5\nBoom Selection? Boom Selection?\nImagine the look on this cynical\nhack's face as he picks up this CD\n- on the front there's two female\nhands caressing a tattooed six\npack. The words \"essential urban\nsoundtrack\" are emblazoned\nacross the middle. One of the\ntracks is called 'The G Spot'. One\nthing's for sure, this is as far from\nMogwai as you could possibly get.\nThe things I 'll do for Felix...but\nit doesn't matter what type of\nmusic you're into, Missy Elliot is\nundeniably a genius, and any CD\nthat starts off with her inspired\nnew single, 'Work It' is a worth a listen. Next up is the ubiquitous Ja\nRule, with his dance floor filler,\n'Livin' It Up'. Black Twang make a surprise but fantastic choice for\nthis compilation with 'So Rotten',\na true street anthem in the mould\nof the Specials. I'm sure I'm not\nthe only one who thinks 'Nu Flow'\nfrom Big Brovaz has become as\nannoying as that Ketchup Song,\nand so should be promptly\nskipped over. 'Boogie 2Nite' by\nTweet and 'Word Love' by\nRhianna are noteworthy tracks;\nDanni Minogue and Fabulous are\nnot. The latter half of CD1 turns\nout to be very good with some\nexcellent drum 'n' bass and garage\ncuts from Jammin', Klute, Po\nSyndicate and Agent X, proving\nthe \"urban soundtrack\" can be\noriginal and innovative.\nCD2 is much better with artists\nsuch as Shy FX and Holly Valance\nalongside the Fugees, Jill Scott\nand the always outstanding Wu\nTang Clan.\nThere is over three hours of\nmusic - and fortunately there are\nmore than misses, and yes, there\ncertainly are some misses here -see the remix of the Streets' 'Has\nIt Come to This?' - it's a dreary,\nplodding dance track, wringing\nthe original completely of it's lyrical genius. \"Boom Selection 2\" is\na decent compilation, not as original as it could be, nor entirely\ncomplete (Justin Timberlake and\nNelly are two significant missing\nnames). Anyway, this CD has\ninspired me to give up my rock\nstar dreams, and make an attempt\nto MC for Blazing Squad...Boooo!!\nRobin Som\nSingles\nKinesis - Billboard Beauty\nIt's only in recent times that\nwe've begun to experience early\nManic Street Preachers influences reaching new bands. Of\nthe more popular ones, King\nAdora are purveyors of glitter\nand sleaze, the sadly departed\nMiss Black America mixed ferocious live sets with staunch politics and now Kinesis have\njoined the fray with their spiky\nguitar anthems and sneering\narrogance.\nLike The Manics, the band\nhave claimed that they'll split\nup after their first album. It\nwould be a huge pity if this is\nanything to go by - A bile-filled\nrant against the media for promoting matchstick-thin models.\nWhilst there are probably more\nimportant things in the world to\nbe worrying about, you would-n't believe it from the passionate lyrics and rampant guitars\non a song with more bite than a million Nickelbacks.\nAlthough not as good as last\nsingle 'Everything Destroys\nItself, this is a more than worthy follow-up and proves\nKinesis are a band to watch out\nfor:\nIf they choose to hang\naround!\n4/5 Deepesh\nStag: Low Watt Glow/Money or\nYour Life\nStag have released two promotional songs in advance of some\nsingles to be released next year.\nThe first of the two is Low Watt\nGlow.\nIf the aim of music is to trigger an emotional response then\nthis song fails. It isn't even any\ngood for dancing to. The song is\nalso boring. More sort of average or un character ful. Perhaps that is too harsh.\nThe lyrics aren't too bad, but\nthere doesn't seem to any message to the listener. The rest of\nit is ok. Robin\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk Darius is Dead! Dead! Dead!\n\n"

Camden (the\nIndie Vegas) is as hit hole, but it's a good, honest to god, shit hole. Islington looks like it's been made\nout of candy. Neon facades of\ntasteless yet boring boutiques and\ntwee, overpriced restaurants line\nthe streets of this once bohemian\nlocale. We pass the Screen on the\nGreen, 'Bowling for Columbine' is\nshowing: The thought of running\namok through the surburb an streets, pumping round after\nround of semi-automatic fire into\nthe Slug and Lettuce until the floor\nis piled high with a bloodied mass\nof casually understated corpses\nseems extremely appealing right\nnow, but alas, we're already late\nfor the gig.\nThe Marquee Club was the hip\ndive where, to the amphetamine\nanthems of the Yardbirds, the\nStones and most notably, the\nWho, brutal battles were fought\non the dance floor between mods\nand rockers. Two viciously sharp\narmies of pilled-up kids with nothing to lose who lived and died for\ntheir clothes, their rides and their\nmusic. Now it's in a shopping c en tre. A FUCKING SHOPPING\nCENTRE! It's in between Next and\nMonsoon. Now, the only possible\nadvantage I can see to this is that\nhoards of drunken teens will\nmaybe pour out of some gig and\nlay waste to the lame and tepid\npieces of shit that pass for style\nand fashion in this san it is ed hellholes of a shrink-wrapped 'mar-ket', typifying of the turd that\nNorth London is becoming.\nThe inside of the club isn't any\nbetter: when we enter, they're\nplaying Gorillaz. Fucking Gorillaz.\nClinical, brightly lit hallways and a slick soulless live room which\nresembles a cross between a hip\nminimalist bar and your school\ndisco. A bunch of be-mullet ed indie kids are play fighting, WWF\nstyle. Compared to outside, it's danger and excitement.\nSo what of King Adora then?\nTheir first gig in ages, God it feels\ngood to have them back. Like a temper tantrum throwing neurotic\nteen, who doesn't know whether\nto tear himself to pieces or go out\nand party, then plumps for both,\nKing Adora's filthy glamour is\noverblown and preposterous, yet\nlife-affirming. All the new songs\nsound just like the old songs, but\nthat's all right, c oz all of King\nAdora's old songs were fucking\ncool. The Law', possibly the only\nsong to mix Chaz'n 'Dave and the\nManics opens. 'Big Isn't Beautiful' - a piss-take song about\na male anorexic - I was doing\npress-ups to this song in the\nmorning, how post-modernist is\nthat for you, trendies? Art imitating life, or life imitating art? King\nAdora - a ray of sunshine in a world of shit (that's London Nl, incase you hadn't guessed).\nRaoul Duke and Dr Gonzo\nGemma Hayes and Suede\nShepherd's Bush Empire\n3/5\nThe Empire is a really good gig\nvenue, the acoustics are good\nand everyone can see the bands.\nI say this because I 've heard\nthat the powers that be want it\nshut down. This should not hap-pen. Damn the Man, Save the\nEmpire.\nNow the minor protest is over\nwith, I can mention the nights\npopular music offerings. First up\nwas Gemma Hayes. She is very\nslight, with messy blond hair\nand seemed to be slightly\nswamped by her electric guitar.\nWhen she started singing\nthough, she sounded like a star.\nThe best way to describe the set\nis rock songs sung by a folk\nsinger. Her voice was sometimes\nhalf hidden by the guitars and\nthe music kind of swirled round\nthe venue.\nHer live performance was\nmarred by a lack of interest from\na large portion of the audience,\nwho chatted loudly through even\nthe quietest songs. I doubt that\nthe gig will go done as a favourite in Gemma Hayes'\nmemory. It was however, a pleasure to be there.\nWhen I chatted to some of my\nmates about Suede I got two\nmain responses:-1) Haven't they split up?\n2) Who are they?\nAnyway, they are still around,\nand in fact have a new album\nout. This has prompted a tour,\nreminding everyone who they\nare.\nThe set was perfect. Suede\nare not the kind of band to play\ntheir entire new album and\nannoy the hell out everyone who\njust wanted to hear the old\nsongs. They played 'Animal\nNitrate', 'She's In Fashion',\n'Everything Will Flow',\n'Beautiful Ones' the hits just\nkept coming.\nBrett was the consummate\nprofessional front man, the\ncrowd were expertly coaxed into\nsinging along. An excellent\nreminder of who Suede are, and\nwhy they are still around.\nSarah\nAlbums\nThe Used - The Used\nAs the name suggests The\nUsed is a compilation of\nrehashed second-hand tracks.\nThe LP has that non-too rare\ncharacteristic of being over\nstyled melodrama in a semi\nmetal wrapping. Targeted well\nat the thirteen year old who\nhave yet grown the ability to\nrecognise a tune, it serves its\npurpose immaculately. If the\nband can ever get passed the\nfact they sound like an Early\nIncubus rip-off Warner Bothers\nshould be shifting millions of\nthese things.\nThe \"poetic\" lyrics are a joke. My full admiration goes to\nthe man with the voice (Bert\nMcCracken) who seemingly\nputs his full emotion into the\nnasty words he wails. My\nfavourite would be:\n\"He feels alone\nHis heart in his hand\nHe's alone\nHe feels alone\nI feel...\"\nObviously real heartfelt bal-la dry here, The Used kindly\npublish all their lyrics in the\ninlay cover and on the website\nfor the added humour of the\ncustomer. This segment was\ntaken from the song \"Poetic\nTragedy\", which says more\nabout what we're dealing with\nhere than I ever could.\nInterestingly enough there\nare highlights to be found in\nthe folds of whining and feed-back. \"Greener with the\nScenery\" has flashes of\nmelody, and John Feldmann\ndid excellently with the string\nparts.\nThe rhythm section also displayed fragments of ability, and\nindeed I sometimes found\nmyself tapping along and wondering how they would be if\nthey found themselves with\nsome decent songs.\n1/5 Sach\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX COLUMN03 AS'132?\nAnd Alex Said...\nChristmas is a coming and I 'll be\ngetting even fatter. I 've dispensed\nwith the usual rubbish chocolate\nadvent calendar this year and built\nmy own. Behind every window is a sausage roll, a mince pie, a small\nbottle of whisky and a selection of\ncrisps.\nYou see, Christmas is a time for\ngorging yourself into a stupor, and\nthe normal little chocolates would-n't be enough to stretch my stomach enough for Christmas dinner.\nIn the Middle Ages, Britons used\nto consume so much food on\nChristmas Day that their sleep\nafter lunch would last until March,\nthereby omitting those crappy\nmonths at the start of the year,\nand handily in time to stock up on\nEaster Eggs.\nThese days Christmas isn't half\nas much fun. The trouble starts\nwith Christmas Shopping. The\nshops have had festive stuff in\nthem since July - last year. So\nmany people take to Oxford Street\nthat the heat generated is enough\nto form its own micro-climate,\nwhich is probably why it's always\npissing with rain whenever I go.\nThe reason there's a McDonalds\nevery 200 yards is because, by the\ntime you've pushed your way\nthrough 200 yards of people, it's time for your next meal.\nIt's a hellish experience just\nmoving about, but then you've got\nto try and find some presents. I'd love to be able to buy my dad that\nperfect gift, but I haven't got\nenough money to buy Nicole\nKidman, so he'll have to make do\nwith another pair of Homer\nSimpson socks. It's the thought\nthat counts.\nIf you're sensible, you'll have got\nall your shopping out of the way by\nthe end of October, which means\nall you have to do is look forward\nto the big day. One thing you won't be looking forward to, though, is\nhaving relatives coming to stay.\nWe only narrowly avoided having\nour elderly Aunty Mabel stay last\nyear, but the day before she was\ndue to come she ended up in hospital after dropping the bumper\nChristmas Radio Times on her\nfoot, completely flattening it, and\nso I was spared receiving yet\nanother garish knitted jumper and\nputting up with her funny smell.\nAunty Sue likes to think of herself as sensible. She likes to save\nmoney by buying all her presents\nin the January sales, and then hiding them for the whole year in her\nkitchen cupboards. Whenever we\nvisit her, it is a family tradition to\ntake a peek and try to guess who'll\nget what - whoever gets the 2002\nCutesy Bunny Wabbits calendar\nshould find it serves them well for\nthe whole six days of 2002 which\nremain after December 25th, but I pity whoever gets the chocolate\nSanta as it's probably going to be\npast its best.\nHopefully this Christmas will be\nquieter for our family. In previous\nyears, the Twatt family next door\nhave irritated the whole street with\nover-enthusiastic carol singing at\nall hours of day and night, and the\nilluminations in their front garden\nconsisting of ten thousand flashing\nlights. They were so bright I actually found it much easier to sleep\nduring the day, but fortunately last\nyear our prayers were answered\nwhen a Boeing 747 landed on top\nof their house.\nIt's now the time to get your\nChristmas tree sorted, but as a student you're not going to be able\nto afford one to rival the one in\nTrafalgar Square. Just use your\nimagination. Last year in my room,\nI cut the largest piece of green fungus from some old bread I'd been\ncultivating, and decorated it with\nleftover meatballs and an assortment of dead insects. It certainly\nbrought a bit of festive cheer to all\nwho saw it, even if it did smell like\na corpse.\nSo, that's the preparations sort-ed. If you've managed to survive\nthe build-up, brace yourself for\nChristmas morning. Last year, at\nabout 3am,I heard footsteps\ndownstairs, so I went down to see\nwhat was going on. I found an old\nman with a white beard, drinking\nsherry and eating mince pies. I do\nwish Uncle Pete wouldn't get up\nso early and eat all the bloody\nfood. \"I'm so excited I can't sleep!\"\nhe said, as I wafted a chloroform-soaked rag under his nose. I carried him back up to his bed, and,\ntwelve months later, he's not\nwoken up yet.\nEverybody loves opening their\npresents on Christmas morning,\nexcept for my brother - he's always\ndisappointed because he makes\nsuch a colossal Christmas list.\nWhen he was six years old, my\nmother tried explaining to him that\nSanta couldn't possibly bring a Formula 1 racing car, a horse and\nan Apache helicopter down the\nchimney. At the age of 27, you'd really think he'd have learned by\nnow.\nBy mid-November we've usually\njust about finished off last year's leftover turkey, so it's good to look\nforward to Christmas dinner. In our\nhouse we keep everything left over\nfrom Christmas dinner until it's eaten - we've still got some\nBrussels sprouts from Christmas\n1984, but hopefully they'll be off\nto university soon and the\nChristmas pudding from 1987 can\nmove into their bedroom.\nAfter dinner, you can regale your\nfamily with the same tired double-entendres about \"pulling crack-ers\". Well, anything to take the\npain away from the feeble\nChristmas crackers themselves I suppose. After exploding with a noise about as loud as amos qui to's heartbeat, out pops a feeble\nhat, a deformed plastic frog and a joke which has been badly translated from the original Japanese,\nwith all the wit of Bobby Davro.\n\"What do you call an Imperial\nCollege rector on a bicycle? Sir\nRichard Bikes!!\"\nAfter dinner, you can spend the\nrest of Christmas Day watching\ntelevision. It's hard to tell the\nrepeats from the new shows usually - this year BBC1 is offering us\nyet another new episode of Only\nFools and Horses. In this episode\nDel Boy flogs a dead horse.\nThen it's time for bed, and it will\nbe all over for another year.\nAlex Warren\nHo ho ho!\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The senior crews were having their hair done and so unavailable for the other divisions.\nWith atrocious rain soaking\neveryone in the morning heats,\nthe women's eight terrified their\nopposition into a no-show, but the\nlong, cold and wet wait nearly\ncaused hypothermia all round.\nHowever, dried up and warmed\nup, they did actually have to do\nsome rowing in the afternoon.\nThey followed last week's success\nin Cambridge with a convincing\nwin in the semi-final and then\ndelivered an assured performance\nin the shortened final to beat UCL\ncomfortably.\nThe men's'B' team were forced\nto stop half-way after an unlucky\nincident in their heat. They did,\nhowever, stay to support the other\ntwo crews - mostly from the bar! -which was greatly appreciated.\nOn the other hand, the men's' A' team were indomitable. After a mismatch, their quarter-final was\nagainst St George's. A calm start\nwith a good rhythm left them as a small speck on the horizon to the\nopposition by the finish line and\nwith a feeling it wouldn't be so\ntrivial next time. Without a change\nof kit or food the team spent time\nwarming bits of themselves under\nthe one hand dryer in the changing rooms during the lunch break\n(with Russell concentrating on the\nimportant parts). Meanwhile, hot\ntea and coffee from Bill and Ian\nprevented pneumonia.\nThe next phase of the after-noon's racing was against a good\nUCL team, who made a frenzied\nstart but wore themselves out by\nthe halfway mark and were then\nonly able to chase the IC steamroller that cruised on to victory.\nThis was effectively the final, as\nthe 'real' final was against ICSM.\nEnough said. Threatened with\nexpulsion from IC boat club if they\nlost to medics, the team rose\nadmirably to the occasion, de moral ising their opposition with a dominant lead before the halfway\nmark and then cruising to the fin-ish, again winning 'easily'.

    "content": "BUSINESS07 After rich promises of better things to\ncome last week, I now present the first\ninstallment of our series of profiles on\nspin outs from Imperial College.\nUnknown to many, Imperial students have been plotting away in little\nwar rooms of their own, concocting up\ndevious little plans to take over the\nbusiness world. Some have been heralded as tomorrow's entrepreneurs\nwhilst most, like myself, are confined\nto indulging in pride salvaging exercises like writing for Felix.\nBut little do they know, that from\nmy new found prerogatives, I am now\nable to bring into light their little deeds\nof roguery. So, I bring you, TBsC tech-no logy... Spin outs Profile #1: TBsC Technology\nWho are they?\nFormer PhD Mech Eng students Jdrg Feist, Simon Hubbard and MBA student Udo Dengel, who won the\nImperial College Business Challenge in 2001 with their business plan.\nWhat do they do?\nHigh temperature gas turbines need a layer of Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) which is vital protecting the\nmetal underneath. How long the coating lasts depends on the heat influx. TBsC, with advance doping (or\nsomething like that) is able to produce temperature sensitive TBC, which would allow engineer to predict the\nlevel of destruction and avoid downtime in the turbines.\nWhere are they now?\nRenamed themselves to Southside Thermal Technologies, and have since won PWC's 'European Awards for\nthe Spirit of Enterprise' and Wall St. Journal Europe's categorical innovation award. They have received\nresearch funding, but will need to secure commercial interests in the product from turbine giants like GE,\nAlstom and Rolls Royce for capital funding. The idea has passed initial US and UK patent screening though,\nand they are talking to the major players in the industry. Once the research is successful, STT will be ready to\nfly.\nThis week in the City..\nOh Dear..\nIn his pre-budget speech,\nChancellor of Exchequer\nGordon Brown admitted to\ngetting his numbers wrong\nin the April budget, and\nhave had to downgrade his\neconomy growth forecast\nfrom 2%-2.5% to 1.6%.\nAdditionally, the public\nsector borrowing will also rise to \u00a320bn, \u00a39bn more than Mr Brown had expected. He blamed\nthe shortfall in tax revenues as the main reason,\nwhere the ailing financial sector have seen capital gain and income tax shrink to almost half of\nwhat it was at its peak. In a futile attempt to\ncover this blunder, Mr Brown pointed out that\nU.K is faring better than the likes of Japan and\nU.S amidst the worst global economic depression\nsince the 70's. Abbey National, Britain's sixth largest bank is to\nbecome the first U.K bank for a decade to slash\nits dividends. After several profit warnings this\nyear, a new management have been installed to\nrestructure Abbey, concentrating on its core businesses of retail banking and mortgage. These\nrestructuring have resulted in a raft of write down\nand goodwill charges tl], which could see Abbey\nannounce an estimated \u00a31.5bn lost.\nAnalysts suggest that the bull run[2] in government bonds is set to end soon. The global economic and stock market slump have seen\ninvestors shy away to the safe haven of government bonds. This surge in demand has pushed\nyield[3] to a historic low, but with the recent rally\nin the UK and US equity market, it is likely that\ninvestors would make a turnaround. What this all\nmeans is that governments around the world will\nhave to pay a higher interest or yield to borrow,\nnot that you care.\no vodafone\nEnfant-Terrible\nThe continuing saga\nbetween Vodafone\nand Vivendi\nUniversal, the French\nconglomerate is set to\nend soon with Vivendi\nexpected to take a controlling share in\nCegetel. Here's how the story goes. Cegetel owns\n80% of SFR, France's3 rd largest mobile opera-tor, France is the only major European market\nVodafone is yet to penetrate. Vodafone already\nowns 20% of SFR and 15% of Cegetel, but\nwould require the 28% of Cegetel that BT owns\nto gain overall control in Cegetel and hence SFR.\nVivendi meanwhile, would like to keep the miserable English off their backyard, and they hold a large share in Cegetel and pre-emp tion right over\nany bids for BT stakes. This means they can\nblock any move for BT's Cegetel shares by buying it themselves instead. Vivendi can't afford\nthis, but might be able to find enough banks to\nback it. Having just rejected Vodafone's bid for its\nown share in Cegetel, Vivendi is expected to go\nahead and acquire Cegetel this week. You're not\nfollowing this are you?\nMyTravel have plunged into the red for the first\ntime in 31 years, which has been brought about\nby a disastrous trading year and changes to\naggressive accounting policies, which have seen\nextra expenses charged at \u00a370.6m, amounting to\na loss of \u00a372.8m. However, having secured an\nextension to its \u00a3250m loan facility from a consortium of banks, new CEO Peter McHugh promises a review of the business in the coming\n[11 Goodwill Charges: Goodwill is the extra\nmoney a company pays for an acquisition\nabove what that company is worth. This goodwill is an asset, but has to be written off slowly as expenses. However, some company writes\nthis down all at once, since investors don't care\nabout goodwill charges, as it's not cash expenses and does not affect shareholder's value.\n[23 Bull Run-. When investors expect a particular market or sector to do well, they call it a bull\nrun, or a bullish market. The opposite of a Bull,\nfor some reason is a Bear.\n[31 Yield: Normally, this means the return an\ninvestment can make over a fixed period. But\nfor bonds, it is the coupon rate/interest payable\ndivided by the market price.\nmonths, which could include disposals of some\nof its loss making units.\nSir Terence Conran, founder of Habitat and\nConran Shop is to launch his first furniture collection since selling Habitat to Ikea in the 70's. The new range, Content by Conran is to be\nlaunched for Christi-Tyler the furniture manufacturer and will bear the Conran name.\nDeloitte & Touche will split a \u00a3100m windfall\namongst its 400 or so partners. This windfall\narose from the fact that the partners had accepted share offers as bonus in Liberata, D&T' s former outsourcing arm, which is now being sold to\nGeneral Atlantic for \u00a3100m, which would see\n\u00a3240k down each partner's pocket.
