    "content": "2 FELIX TALES FROM THE HOLS!\nWe asked students to tell us about any\nactivities of theirs during the summer holidays which they thought might interest our\nreaders. Here are some of their reports, collected verbatim.\n1. From Miss Jossie Delgado, Chem 11.\nT think that some of your readers might\nbe interested to hear of my experiences this\nlast summer in the glamorous world of films.\nIt all bee an one bright summers's day as I was strolling through the park in my mink\nbikini admiring the flowers. A man came up\nto me and i told me that I had a nice figure,\nfor which I thanked him. Are you interested\nin Art he said. Well, yes I said. Being at uni-vers it y, one is naturally, isn't one. I'm glad\nof that, he said since I can visualise you in\nmy next film, which will be very artistic. The\nhuman body, young lady \u2014 he\u00bb was a very\nfriendly man and always calling me young\nlady and putting his arms around me and \u2014\nthe human body, young lady, is the most\nbeautiful creation in this world, more magnificent than even the greatest painting of\nAnnigoni or any other famous artist, more\nwonderful than even the greatest miracle of\nmodern science. We are going to immortal is e the human body, young lady, young lady, you\nand I, though in a tasteful way. We shall cast\naway shame and proclaim to the world the\nbeauty of the human figure unadorned. It'll\nbe a sensation. Since he was such a nice refined man, and had such a lovely way of\ntalking, I accepted. Not every girl would have,\nbut in the cause of Art who could refuse.\nAnd if by any chance the film in which 1\nappeared, \"Nudist Reverie\", should be showing at your local cinema, look out for me\nI'm the third pair of breasts from the left, the\none tastefully holding a suitcase in front of\nher middle.\n2. From Ralph Dashwood. Civil HI.\n...well, there we were, sitting in this Berlin\npub, sampling the local brew, when this German blok e came up to us. He spoke English\nperfectly by the way. Why more of these\nfore ig per s cant take the trouble to learn the\nlingo. I don't know. And he asked us how\nwe'd like to earn a spare bit of bier money.\nWell, alright we said, being low on the old\nhard stuff at the time. What gives. It's brick\nlaying, he said. Anything for a giggle, so we\nall agreed. There was this wall see, had to\nbe built four feet high...\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nCOMMEMORATION DAY THURSDAY,26 TH OCTOBER19613 P.M. Special Visitor:\nTHE RT.

    "content": "by COLCUTT\nLife at College during the vacation is not\nso very different from life during term-time;\nnobody has seen the President for weeks, the\nSecretary is still running round in little\ncircles with his leather brief-case tucked neatly under his left arm, and the usual figures can\nbe seen running straight from their departments to the bar and returning (not quite so\nstraight) some time later. There is somehow\nan air of farcical scholarship about the place.\nOne is at first surprised and pleased to see\npeople moving with a definite aura of purpose,\ntheir faces shining with the yearning for\nknowledge, only to find the only knowledge\nthey yearn for can be summed up in the oft-repeated question, \"Where's the television set?\nIf we don't find by Friday we'll miss Yogi'.\"\n\u00a9\nIt is interesting at this time to wonder what\nsort of year the Union will have. That it will\nbe different to last year is undoubted, but\nhow drastic will the change be? After the terribly English approach of last year's Union\nExecutive, the aloof efficiency of President\nHill, the down-to-earth-spade-is-a spade semi-efficiency of Secretary Carter, and those three\ntrue Englishmen, Buet the talker, Greaves the\ndreamer, and business man Logan, the transatlantic approach of Si Lyle and Martin Stacey\nwill inevitably make a great difference. That\nthe Union business will be done with great\nefficiency beyond doubt. The vast executive\nexperience of Lyle will stand him in good\nstead, and after the terribly efficient way that\nStacey handled the Carnival accounts, no-one\ndoubts his competence. But what of the life\nin the Union?\n\u00ae\nNeither the President or Secretary has been\ninvolved in the social or administrative side\nof the Union to any notable degree, but their\nbrilliant organisation of the Carnival indicates\nthat they have ability and imagination. One\nhopes that they can use their independance to\nalleviate some of the strain between those\ngroups labelled \"the boys\" and \"the politic-ian s\" and the President can have a tremendous influence on the life in the Union. In fact\nsome old hands at the Union game say that\nlife in Union is reflected in the life of the\nPresident and his a soci ate s.I wish him the\nvery best of luck for a lively and happy term\nof office.\n\u00a9\nTHIS SPACE COSTS ONLY6 s. TO UNION SOCIETIES;\nFIFTEEN INSERTIONS ONLY \u00a3 3\nAdvertise\nin FELIX\nKENSINGTON ROUND POND\nCongratulations to Mike Breggazzi, for not\nonly did he win the Union General Award\nthis summer, but he has become the father\nof a baby girl. Our best wishes go to Mike,\nJan and the baby.\n\u00a9\nThe retiring President of the Union is stilt\n'to be seen around the place occasionally,\nwe wonder if he is going to get a job after\nall. The incoming President seems to be lying pretty dog go, but he has had some contact with the Editor so perhaps, he can fill\nus in. Perhaps Si has been keeping a constant watch on the chairs in the hall of the\nGeographical Society building. He may not\nwish to repeat the performance given by\nPresident Hill with a collapsing chair at last\nyear's Freshmen's Reception.\n\u00a9\nWe overheard a strange remark in the Ennismore the other evening. Mr. Loome was\nsaying, in the eve of his departure for Africa,\nof himself and Mrs. Cox. \"We are just good\nfriends!\"\n\u00a9\nMr, Stacey and the College architect had\nhad a tour of South Side one afternoon last\nweek, ostensibly to study colour schemes.\nJudging by his comments he expects to see a new race of moles created in that warren rather\nthan a new species of avant garde scientist.\nHis views seem to echo those given by the\nretiring Union Secretary, \"What with hidden\nlighting, shared lighting, half lighting, full\nlighting and concealed lighting some of the\nrooms have no bloody lighting at all.\"\n\u00a9\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Re-Colcutt'B ambiguous remark about filling! in, the only contact I have\nhad with the President has been by the once-weekly pony express to the Pack Horse at Widdop, where I have been lying dog go.I can only\nsay that the President has not been there.\nIt is a little early for me to think of filling in\nColcutt, though things may -reach this pass\nlater in the session.\nby John Jennings\nCROSS COUNTRY\nCLUB\nRunners of any standard are warmly welcomed by the club. Fixtures for three regular\nteams are held every Wednesday and Saturday, both in London and throughout England.\nFor those who like to train there are frequent\nruns in Hyde Park from the Union as well\nas weight and circuit training facilities.\nThe club are present University of London\nChampions and League winners with many\nmembers in the U.L. teams.

The very\nsmall type in last session's issues came in for\na good deal of criticism, and we think that\nthe present size is a definite improvement.\nAnother innovation is an article by an ex-editor of Phoenix; we hope that those rude\npeople who maintain that Felix' staff are\nilliterate will be able to tell the difference.\nFreshmen may be a little confused over\nthis PhoenixvFelix business so perhaps, explanations would be welcome. Phoenix was\nfounded by H.G. Wells many years ago and\nis now a mainly literary journal appearing four\ntimes a year, whereas Felis is a mere twelve\nyears old and is a fortnightly newspaper.\nThese two publications are in de pedant and\nare not subject to the censorship of the College or the Union, though the appointment\nof their editors must be approved by the Union\nExecutive.\nFinally, and to Freshmen in particular, before succumbing to the many societies passionately urging you to join their ranks you\nmight consider joining the staff of these news-paper; there is room for talent and/or enthusiasm in every department and no previous experience is necessary. We have vacancies for\ntypists, reporters and salesgirls, and in particular the Editor would like to engage the services of a Sports Editor and someone to assist\nhim in setting up the pages at the printers'\non alternate Wednesday evenings.

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OP IMPERIAL COLLEGE ONION NO. tt* IT4. OCT.2 ND1961 PRICE4D A WELCOME TO ALL FRESHMEN It soon became apparent as I sat down to\nwrite this article that I had three alternatives, a humourous article, a description of the Union,\nor a lecture. After further thought humour\nseemed out of my field, a descriptive article\ncould only hope to summarize the speeches\ngiven by the clubs committees chairmen, and\nconstituent college presidents \u2014 so a lecture.\nWhy a lecture? Please read on for the an-s wer. Apathy \u2014 the disinterest of students in\ntheir college \u2014 is common to all colleges\nand universities, and unfortunately Imperial\nCollege is not an exception. The dislike for\napathy is not just a whim of the senior stud-ents, but it is an indication of the fact that\nstudents are not getting the most out of their\ncollege.\nMost of us prefer to have some time to\nrelax, and many of us have to watch that\nthis rest period does not become extensive so\nthat it const it u at es wasted time. One way to\navoid this is to participate in other activities,, as here you can find not only a change,\nwhich in many ways is another form of re-lax ation, but you will also reap the benefits\nof learning how to meet and work with other\npeople; and handle business and financial\nmatters.\nNaturally, this participation cannot be expected of all members of the student body.\nThere are those whose ambitions are set ->na career of post-graduate studies and research,\nand it is only sensible for these people to concentrate on their academic ce re ers. However,\nthe vast majority of students will enter industry where the demand is for a person with\na broader outlook, and one who can feel confident in an atmosphere of business matters.\nSo to these students), and this most like lv means you, I recommend that all temptations\nto waste time or make excuses for being disinterested be overcome and you make the\neffort to participate actively in the Union\nactivities. You will find no better place 1 0\ndevelope the confidence I referred to above\nas here in the Union, where you will learn\nthese things in a friendly and congenial, but\nbusiness-like atmosphere.\nWhile disc using the appropriate use of your\ntime it is worth mentioning one fact of the\nby\nI.C. PRESIDENT\nSI LYLE Union set up which might appear to demand\ntwice your time if you were to become an\nactive member of the Union. This fact is the\ndual Union system which exists. That is, each\nof you are members of both a constituent college Union and the Imperial College Union.\nHowever, the I.C. Union is basically an amalgamation of the interest of the three constituent College Unions, thus participation in\none Union leads to or constitutes participation\nin both. The only sphere where this is not true\nis that of Union Meetings. The meetings held\nin your constituent colleges should be a must\non your attendance list as here you get the\n\"spirit\" of your college. This in turn leads\nto friendly rivalry and enthusiasm amongst\nthe three constituent college Unions. The I.C, Union meetings on the other hand are of a different nature as they are the forum of opinion\nand discussion of matters and policy which\naffect all the students regardless of in which\nconstituent college they have membership.\nThus you can see that taking an active part\nin both Unions is not twice as time con sum ing, but you will find it is definitely twice\nas rewarding.\nWell, I have told you only a few of the\nreasons why you should take an active part\nin your College affairs, but I hope they are\nsufficient to encourage you to derive as much\nas you can from your college career.\nHow do you show this participation?\nDuring the afternoon of Oct. 2nd all of\nthe major clubs will have information booths\nset up in the Union Building, and here you\ncan learn what each club does, and join those\nthat suit your interests. However, join the\nathletics teams and/or clubs with the intention\nand ambition that the captaincy or presidency\nis your goal. As your ambitions grow you\ncan expand your interests to a wider scope.\nBut remember such activities are a two way\nstreets as your participation in the Union\nbrings to it new ideas and enthusiasm, thus\nnot only do you benefit from its experience,\nbut the Union expands and becomes a stronger body of students.\nSo do participate, but do so with properly\nappropriating your time so that in three years\ntime when you graduate you can look back\nto both a successful academic and extracurricular career.\nMay 1 wish you all the very best in your\nstudies and I hope to see you around the\nUnion. Remember if you cannot find any information you want in the Blue Book the\nUnion Office is always open at lunchtime,\nand somebody there will always try to help.\nSincerely,\nYour President\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Your\nPresident\nSEA FORTH LYLE It undoubtedly came as something of a surprise to many members of the Union to\nlearn late last term that a Canadian had been\nelected President of the Union. For Seaforth\n'Si' Lyle, although well known about the\nUnion for his highly successful management\nof last year's Charity Carnival, had rather\nbelatedly decided to throw his hat into the\nPresidential election ring.\nLyle was born in Montreal, Canada, in\n1936 and since then has been accumulating\nan impressive record in both the academic\nand social spheres. While earning his Bachelor of Engineering and later his Master of\nEngineering degrees in Electrical Engineering\nat McGill University, he found time, at the\nexpense of considerable sleep to be on the\nBoard of Managers of the McGill Students\nUnion, and was elected Chairman of the\nStudents' Union Committee in 1957. Those\nwho are familiar with the North America\nfraternity system will be able to appreciate\nthe significance of Lyle's election as President\nof the Phi-Kappa-Pi in 1957, an office which\ncan be compared with his present post. He\nis still, reluctantly, editor of the {National\nFraternity Handbook, and was, until recently,\nand much less reluctantly. Chairman of the\nAdvisory Board of the Fraternity. For the\nsake of the record, it should be added that\nfor three years he was responsible for the\nlighting displays of the very elaborate McGill\nUniversity Carnivals ,and took a hand in organising University and Fraternity social act-iv i ties. During his summer vacations he put\nin some time with 'industrial organisations,\nand was credited with two scientific papers\nwhile working with Westinghouse.\nSi came to Britain on an Athlone Fellowship to work on automatic control, and will\nstay for two years. It is perhaps, only natural\nthat he has already made his mark in this\nCollege, but few will know that he is President\nof the Overseas Science Students' Association,\nand also edits i the 'Athlone Observer. He\nfinds English life very agreeable, clearly enjoys English beer, likes English girls, and has\nbeen known to join in distinctly English songs.\nIn his rare moments of free time, he plays\ntennis, is a demon on an ice rink, and can\ngive anyone a good game of bridge.\nLyle has no burning ambitions to revolution is e the Union, firmly believing that a smoothly operating organisation is best left\nto itself. To confuse this attitude with apathy\nwould be a grave mistake, for Lyle is convinced that our existing facilities must be\nused with the greatest efficiency to ensure the\nmaximum benefit to the student body as a whole. He has a watchful eye, and efficacious\nremedies, for wasteful or obstructionist pr act ices.\nHis energy, determination to get things\ndone, and his extensive view of current developments within the College amply qualify\nLyle for the Presidency, and the Union can\nhave confidence in his experience and ability\nto handle its affairs for the coming year.\nYour Secretary\nMARTIN STACEY Martin Stacey, this year's Secretary of the\nUnion was born in Bristol in 1939. At a tender age he, (and his family, moved ito\nU.S.A. Then they moved to Canada in 1949,\nNew Zealand in 1952, and returned to\nEngland in 1954.\nMartin completed his schooling at Wallington Country Grammar School, Surrey, and\ncame to Imperial College in 1957. Martin\nalways an enthusiastic student applied him sell diligently to his academic work and graduated in 1960 with an honours degree in Chemical Engineering. During this time Martin\ntook little interest in Union activities, but\nlast year as Carnival treasurer he proved that\nthese years of non-participation did not in\nany way handicap his capabilities. It soon became evident that these years must have added\nto his enthusiasm and energy as he fulfilled\nall the responsibilities given to him with the\nutmost dexterity.\nOnce he had found a balance between his\nPhD research project and his Union activities\nhe promptly set about to enhance ('??) his\nsocial reputation. His social career has now\nbecome widely de versified. and an appropriate part of it is now on the classified list.\nWe might now say that he is indeed ready for\nthe position of Secretary of the Union. He is\nstill enthusiastic, and capable to perform this\ntask, so he will undoubtedly uphold the traditions of the Union.\nI. C.W A. PRESIDENCY VACANT Because she is unable to hold a grant for\nher research work in Micro-biology, Anne\nHodnett will not be returning to the College\nfor this session. This means a new President\nwill have to be elected for I CW A early this\nterm.\nThe death occured on September 25th of\nthe Secretary of the College and Clerk to the\nGovernors, Mr. J. M. Corin.\nJohn Madan Corin was born in Capetown\nin 1907. He was educated at St. Paul's School\nand Magdalen College, Oxford, and in the\nyears 1930 to 1946 he was in India as a member if the Indian Civil Service. In 1949 he joined\nthe Ministry of Town and Country planning,\nand in 1949 he came to the College as Financial Secretary. Mr. Corin became the Acting\nSecretary of the College in 1957, and in 1958\nhe took the post which he held at his death.\nTo his wife and two children the Union\ntenders its deepest sympathies.\nIF YOU WANT TO PLAY A WINTER SPORT PLAY\nHOCKEYTRIALS\nWEDNESDAY & SATURDAY\n'SEE NOTICE BOARD\nFelix\nneeds staff:\nREPORTERS TYPISTS\nSALESGIRLS\nADVERTISING MANAGER SPORTS EDITOR\nPRODUCTION MANAGER CONTACT THE EDITOR\nRoom 88 New Hostel\nor\nvia Union Rack\n\n"

A.'s and Bugattis can be seen at our f ii hn shows.\nWe try to suit all tastes \u2014 road racing rallies\nand trials.\nAmong our other activities we have table-top rallies for Mie potential navigator and\nquizzes for the student of motoring history.\nAs for visits, we have been to Lotus, Jaguar,\nCoventry-Qimaxj, M lG. and i the Montague\nMotor Museum in the past.\nWe must also introduce you to our college mascot, Boanerges. We are his guardians,\nhe is our pride and joy. Who is Bo? He is a1902 James and Browne veteran car, and as\nIthe President's official carriage he attends\nmost Union functions. Only once in the past\ndecade has he failed to make 'The Run' to\nBrighton. His un keep involves much labour,\nespecially in maintaining the polish on his\nlarge acreage of brass work. Enthusiastic\nhelpers are rewarded by an unrivalled ex-per ie nce,a ride in a veteran car.\nIf our activities interest you come along,\nwith no obligation, to our first meeting this\nsession on October 13th at 5.15 p.m. in Room\n664, E.l block.\nTHE ART CLUB During the next few days you will probably\nbe overwhelmed by requests, imploring s,\">r direct orders as the case may be. from the\norganisers of the various college clubs and\nsocieties to join their numbers. This tends\nto produce confusion and even a temporary\nloss of identity as the strain of imagining yourself successively as rugby player and poet,\nmarxist and conservative, humanist and christ-ian, becomes too much. Only the most confirmed believer in the superiority of his own\ntaste is likely to come out of this unscathed,\nand $he alternative forms of hysteria that\noccur are the JOIN THE LOT TO HELL WITH WORK I'M GOING TO BE A WELL ROUNDED SOCIALLY INFORMED POLIT1CALLF ACTIVE CULTURALLY AWARE SPORTING LY ABLE NON SCIENTIFIC SCIENTIST and the IAM UNWORTHY OF ALL THIS ATTENTION UNSUITED AND INCAPABLE FOR ALL THESE CALLINGS PERHAPS, I'LL TRY NEXT YEAR. The first hallucination seldom last more than a few weeks, never longer\nthan a year; the second all too frequently\ncontinues for the full three years.\nWhat has all this to do with the Art Club?\nWell, this club offers certain advantages, the\nfirst being the most opposite to my first paragraph of thumping digression. It isn't really\na club, you don't pay a membership fee,\nand you are entirely at liberty to come once\nand never again, to drift in and out or to\ncome every week as the fancy takes you.\nSecondly, this is an active rather than a passive\nclub, not concerned Kvith appreciation but\nwith doing. Too much of this College is spent\nin imparting knowledge to the passive, and\nby implication stupid mind. This is a chance\nto do, to feel, to create for yourself. Thirdly,\npainting is for enjoyment for us, not the serious pursuit of aesthetic achievement. It\ndoesn't matter if you have never picked up\na paint brush before in your life or if all\nyour drawings turn out like stick men. There\nwill be somebody there to help you if you\nwant it and nobody will laugh at you because you aren'ta Rembrandt.\nWhy painting particularly? It's always\ndifficult to rational is e anything you do but\nthe best way of putting it is roughly this \u2014\nby photography you record a sense, by painting you feel it. In a monochromatic flat\nWorld, colours and shapes become apparent.\nAfter the talk the details. The Art Club\nwill meet every Wednesday afternoon, beginning on the the second Wednesday of term.\nThe meetings will provide an opportunity to\ndraw and to paint, under professional tuition\nand with a model. The cost of each class,\nwhich will last from 2.30 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. will be 4/\u2014, this covering the cost of paints,\nbrushes, and all other necessary materials\nwhich will be available to everybody who\ncomes along. The classes will be held in Room\nB.3. in the Royal College of Art. behind the\nHuxley Building. (Details of how to get there\nwill be put on the Union notice board.) It's also hoped to have at a later date meetings\nmit coffee, social rather than intellectual, on\na Tuesday or Thursday lunchtime. If you want\nany further details or if you'd just like a talk,\nplease get in touch with me through the Union\nrack. TONY MUSGRAVE\nTHE IMPOSSIBILITY OF AGNOSTICISM HEARD R.
