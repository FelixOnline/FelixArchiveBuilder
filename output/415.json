    "content": "MU X11 FOOTBALL\nRUGBY\nEarly birds just\ncatch the worm\nImperial College A25 Centaurs 10\nTHIS TIME, the A's assembled\nat the unearthly hour of nine\non a very cold Saturday\nmorning anticipating a ten-thirty kick-off at Harlington.\nIn fact, the game was delayed\nbecause the Centaurs arrived\nlate, and then with only\nthirteen players. No\nexplanation was offered to the\npunctual, but frozen A's. Anyway, it was a relief to\nsee them arriving by car and\nnot by horse box.\nThe game started well for\nthe A's with Steve Block scoring an early try in the\ncorner. Then the lead was\nincreased by a penalty from\nDick Pullen. Having started\nso well the A's felt no need\nto get on with the game and\ntheir relaxed attitude was\nsoon punished by a try and\npenalty from Centaurs.\nHowever, the A's managed to\nreach half time with a lead\nof 10\u20147 following a second\nDick Pullen penalty.\nA change around in the\nforwards meant a much more\nsettled pack in the second\nhalf but shortly after the\nrestart a Centaur penalty\nlevelled the scoring and\nthe A's found themselves\nstruggling with the last\nquarter of the game approach-ing. A little more effort and\nco-ordination brought seven\npoints in two minutes. A. quick passing move down\nthe backs, following a penalty five yards out, gave\nChris Becque the chance of\na try in the corner. That\nwas followed by Dick Pullen monotonously kicking a penalty. Two more tries\nthen followed. The pack won\nthe ball near the Centaur\nline, John Thomas took off by\nhimself (he is a modest chap).\nAfter breaking through two\ntackles and diving for the\nline he decided to pass, by\nbouncing the ball off the\nground l Chris Becque gathered,\nsat down, and scored! A superb forward pass by\nSteve Block put Chris over for\nhis third try.\nA hat trick of tries by\nChris Becque saved what\nmight otherwise have been a dismal morning. In the end it\nwas a victory for the A's, but\nby an un flatteringly small\nmargin, considering the state\nof tITe opposition. There was\nlittle co-ordination, too much\nindividual enterprise and too\nmany mistakes. But it was,\nafter all, a victory.\nTeam:- R Pullen, S Block, C Becque, R Leeson, J Pitcher,\nM Gibson, J Thomas, B Bubb,\nJ Day, R Oyler, R Porter, C Cuthertson, J Fishburn, R'e nner, T Griffiths.\nChris Cutherbutson\nLADIES ROWING\nHEAD'S ROLL\nLAST WEDNESDAY, the\nLadies' Boat Club claimed\ntheir first head, when the\nsecond crew surprisingly won\nthe UL IVs head, beating the\n1st crew by 11 sec, over a17 min row. Due to illness a substitution had to be made\nin the first boat and the third\ncrew had to be scratched.\nThis was. the first ladies\ntrophy to be won, and now\nholds pride of place in the\nBoathouse trophy cupboard. As usual UL organisation was\nnon-existent, and the crews\nwere kept waiting IVihours on\nthe river before they were\nfinally started, by what\nturned out to be the finish\nboat as we 11.\nUnfortunately the second\nhead, at Bedford on Saturday\nwent to Cambridge I. IC\nladies rowed well however,\nbeating UL II by over a minute, although unfortunately\ncoming in 20secs behind ULI who were in a superior boat.\nThis Saturday see ea third head, which we hope\nwill be won by IC. Thanks\ngo to Charlie, the boatman\nfor his encouragement, and\nto Nigel and Gary for co xing us so we lI.U L/ Vs Head\nI Bow A Heap\n2 I Pollock\n3 C Hodgson\nStroke G Taplin\nCox N Williams\nII Bow S James\n2 S Massey\nStroke B Ness\nCox G Nolan\nEulogy on a win\nON WEDNESDAY IC 1 St XI\nscored their second victory\nin a row, thanks mainly to\nthe LSE goalkeeper.\nFresh from their easy\nvictory over QMC IC started\nhesitantly and the game was\nscrappy until a piece of sheer\nindividual genius from Terry\nLindon raised the standard\nof the game. Pulling down his shorts for the fullback, he\ncut inside and hit an unstop-able shot which travelled ten\nfeet before dribbling towards\nthe goalkeeper who almost\nthrew it into his own net.\nLindon, 1 - 0 . Before half\ntime Terry Grirnwades' shot,\nafter a cross from the right,\nwas deflected by a defender\nthrough the goalkeeper's, hands; 2 - 0 .\nOn the restart with IC\nstill licking Terry's oranges\nfrom their teeth LSE scored.\nThis caused IC to at last\nstart to play football. Within\nfive minutes Terry Grimwade's shot from Terry\nLind on' s cross was guided\nin by Pat Frampton; 3 - 1 .\nFive minutes later a good\nmove sent Pat Frampton\n. chasing goal wards to' slot\nin the fourth as t tre goalkeeper\ncame out. A bullet header\nfrom Pat Frampton after a pin-point cross from limping\nBobby Dutton completed his\nhat-trick and made the score\n5\u20141. (Truth from Mick Popper:\nGood cross, header, cobb ed up and the goalkeeper pushed\nit into his own net). There\nthen followed a long period\nwith Ian Huntington trying\nto make Dick Has ler let in.,\nanother goal, but Dick was\nup to it, coming out well to\nstop the LSE forwards.\nMike Popper bustled\nineffectively in - midfield,\nJun l ley overlapped well, Dave Brabbin and Chris Howley looked safe at the\nback and Phil Singleton ran\nwell in midfield. The highlight\nof the game: seeing Concorde\nbefore the start. Another\ngood performance from IC. Team:- D Hasler, J lle y,D Brabbin, I Huntington, C Howley, M Popper, T Grimwade (1), P Singleton, T Lindon (1), P Frampton (3),\nB Dutton.\nPF ramp ton\nSPORTING MOTORCYCLE CLUB\nTrial by error\nTHE COLLEGE racer, a Honda CB72, was due to\nhave its first outing of the\nnew season on 6th March.\nDuring practice however, it\ndeveloped lubrication problems.\nThe result was that the race\nat Snelterton, Norfolk was\nnot entered. It was then\ndecided that the club should\nhold a trial between ours elves. By chance we managed\nto find some suitable terrain\nnearby in a wood.\nThe trial consisted of 4\nsections, three of which\nnecessitated riding for a short time in a muddy stream.\nThe sections were devised by Tim Saunders' warped\nmind. The last section\nentailed passing piles of\nrandomly placed logs.\nAlthough the college's\" trials\" bike is not a trials\nbike because some of its\nphysical dimensions and\nengine characteristics are\nnot those of a genuine\nmachine, the event did\nprovide an introduction to\nthe art of trials riding.\nThe word art is used\nvery loosely.

    "content": "REVIEWS cont'd Theatre\n'Watch 5t Come Down' by John Osborne\nAt the National Theatre\nJOHN OSBORNE' S newly performed\nplay opened at the Old Vic last week\nand can be seen in the National Theatre's repertoire from March 20th. The title\ncomes from a demolition company's advertising motto: \" We do it: You watch it come down\"; and by the end\nof the evening you feel that the\ndemolition experts have done a pretty\nthorough job. I cannot claim to be an\nOsborne expert, but I could not help\nthinking that here were Jimmy and\nAlison Porter, twenty years later,\nwith the roles reversed.\nBen Prosser is an English Oscarwinning film director who hopes to\nescape from the unpleasantness of\ntown dwelling by setting up house in are dun tant country railway station,\nsumptuous ly furnished with the latest\nfrom Heal's. Unfortuna'ely he bargains\nwithout the local country vandals whose\nidea of a good time is to spend it with\na shotgun. Meanwhile his wife keeps\nup a fairly steady stream of vituperation\nwhich occasionally flares into the row\nto end all rows. Amongst their co-mates\nin exile are Glen, the dying writer, who\ncompletes his twelve hundred page\nbook as his ingenue admirer prepares\nhis herbal tea, and Raymond, the\ncamp escapee from Leicester and the\nrag trade, who tries to keep the peace\nwith lavish helpings from the well stocked drinks trolley.\nThe central feeling that the play\ngives is one of hope in the strength\nof personal relationships despite the\nturmoils of the public world. Whilst\nBen and Sally (admirably played by\nFrank Finlay and Jill Bennett) row\ntheir way thro j gh the evening, mi.re\npositive relationships are being worked\nout between all the exiles, the prime\nmover in these multifarious activities being Jo, in a glorious performance\nby Susan Fleetwood, who loves every-body.\nThe setting is by Hayden Griffin,\nwho has shown a remarkable attention\nto detail. The disused railway station\nstill houses some of the relics of its\nformer glory; the platform ticket machine,\nthe booking office hatch; whilst the\nmodern additions provide what mj st be a property master's nightmare, in\nterms of sheer numbers.\nThomas Stevenson\nOld Flames By EA Whitehead\nEDWARD TREATS women very badly,\nbut it does not bother him. As soon as\na situation becomes too difficult to\nhandle, he walks away from it, leaving\nothers to pick up the pieces. Thus, at the\nbeginning of the play, having been\ninvited by his girlfriend to an intimate\nsupper on her houseboat, he makes no\nmention of the two wives he has deserted,\nor the cruel way he has treated his\nparents. These episodes in his life\nare irrelevant to the business in hand.\nHowever, when his ex-wives and mother\nturn up on the boat for supper, he\nfinds himself floundering, unable to\nreconcile his relationships with these\nthree. And then they eat him.\nFeasting upon cheesecake in the\ntheatre's coffee bar, I wondered how\nrealistic the character of Edward was\nmeant to be. Someone who so totally\nignored the feelings of women would be\nhard to find. But, as the conversation in\nthe second act moved on to men in\ngeneral it became clear that the women\nmix considered all males to be just as odious as Edward, who was clearly\nmeant to be a personification of the\ndefinitive male chauvinist stereotype.\nBut the female characterizations were\nscarcely more sympathetic. They seemed\nto regard sex as a mere exercise in\nwhich each side is out for what they\ncan get.\nI do not think I have ever seen a production which love is so totally\nabsent, when the subject matter is\ncontinually crying out for a touch of\nhumanity which never comes. So what\ndo we have left? A lot of fruity language\ncertainly, and moments of genuine\nhumour, some of which stirred the\nladies in the audience to bursts of\nsympathetic applause while leaving\nthe gentlemen bewildered. All of this\nadds up to give a very entertaining\nplay laced with bitter cynicism and a touch of cannibalism. Something for\neveryone.\nSteve Randal I IDOMENEO English National Opera\nColiseum\nIn rep until March 26th IDOMENEO, first performed in Munich\nin 1781 was Mozart's first major opera\nand while unquestionably a masterpiece\nhas been relatively neglected, it has\nless immediate theatrical appeal than\nthe later operas, being partly rooted in\nthe older opera seria tradition. The\nfirst half of the work is largely a succession of solo recitatives and\narias, in effect sung declamations\nwhich give a severe formal and static\nimpression; a sort of dramatic costume\noratorio. The question arises as to\nwhether the theatrical trappings really\n9 _ enhance the musical experience.\nIn the English National Opera\nCompany's production, three of the\nfour principals are dramatically con-vinci ng, the chorus hams valiantly, but\nthe costumes and sets are if anything\nrather distracting. In Homeric Crete,\nbulls' horns and dolphin motifs are\nindeed to be expected but the down-at-heel followers of Lorenzo di Medici\nand soldiers who have apparently\ndeserted from the army of Ghenghis\nKhan are puzzling elements. Elektra\nseems to be moonlighting from a Wagnerian production (an illusion to which\nthe person of Rita Hunter lends powerful\nsupport) and the also-ran s and other\nranks are kit ted out in ultra-drab all purpose me daeva l peasant garb so that\nit comes as no surprise that they are\nsoon ravaged by plague and, towards the\nend of Act Two by a fearsome monster\nfrom the region of the Dress Circle. This creature is acting on behalf of\nNeptune who finally appears in person\n(in the form of the largest and ugliest\nstatue in the ancient world) to prevent\nKing Idomeneo from sacrificing his son\nIdamante and thus facilitating a happy\nending, very much against the run of\nevents.\nThe slightly ludicrous elements of\nthis production are however, made to\nseem trivial by the splendour of the\nmusic; the score is sublime (inviting\ncomparison with no other Mozart opera\nbut rather with Fidelio) and the performance under Charles Mack eras s went\na long way towards doing it justice.\nRita Hunter sung superbly while John\nMitchinson (Idomeneo) and Lois Macdonall (Ilia) were impressive. One\nwondered however, whether a concert\nperformance with substantially the\nsame cast might not have been an\nequally satisfying experience.\nMichael Barrett\nProust by Roger Shattuck (Fontana).\nMa^ce! Proust spent half his li'e writing a book which, when finished,\nwas long enough to make 'War and\nPeace' look like an ambitious paragraph.\nAs it is based on the experiences of\nthe first half of his life, it is unavoidably\nquasi-autobiographical,and Prof. Shattuck\nhas in fact written this book more about\n'In Search of Lost Time' than the life\nof its author, these two things being\nmore or less inseparable. When tackling\na work of this length (about 3000 pages)\nits handy to have some idea of what is\ngoing on before you start, or you could\nall too easily become rather lost in the\nmultitude of ideas and concepts which\nrun through the book. This new explanation gives a concise analysis of Proust' so eu vre and, if you are going to attempt\nthe great marathon, is an essential\nlimbering \u2014 up exercise. The Poor Mouth, by Fann O' Brien.( Picador)\nIF YOU EVER get invited to a literary\nluncheon party, darling, a safe name to\nspout over your gin and tonic is Flan nO' Brien( real name Brian Nolan). As he wrote largely in Gaelic his work has\nbeen rather inaccessible until recently,\nbut now you can sample him in Picador, and anyone who's anyone thinks he' s great. None of this is much use to\nMr O' Brien because he died ten years\nago, but you can't have the cake and\nthe ha'penny can you?\nThis book is a collection of stories\nabout a young man in Ireland; pigs, potatoes and poverty all play a large\npart. It's rated as funny, which it is, in a dry, surreal way; and he doesn't mention Guinness once.\nThe Forest People. (Picador)\nby Colin Turnbull\nTHE FOREST PEOPLE are a tribe\nof pygmies who inhabit a dense, almost\nunexplored forest in the depths of the\nCongo; not the most hospitable place\nin the world, no Wimpy bars or other\nsigns of modern civilisation. The\npeople who live here, the Bambuti, are\neven less civilised than the inhabitants\nof IC. Colin Turnbull, an anthropologist,\nwent to live with and study these\nunique folk, and managed to get accepted\nby them, no mean feat in itself.\nAt the end of his stay there he wrote\nthis fascinating book about a race\nwhose lifestyle is as different from\nours as little green men. And yet the\nquestion asked by the book is at first\nsight almost ridiculous; are these\npeople really any different from us\nfundamentally? It appears that the way\nin which man thinks and, indeed, runs\nhis life, is essentially the same throughout the broad spectrum of present day\n' civilisations', and arguably, throughout\nhistory; only the external trappings\ndiffer.\nAnother point, possibly a disturbing\none, is that despite (because of?)\ntheir simplicity, people such as these\nare more at peace than us. Some might\nargue that as a race they are more\nmature; but you can form your own\nopinions on that after reading this\nthought - provoking, well written book.\nMore than just presenting a case history of some obscure society with no\napparent relevance to our world, it acts\nas a valuable tool in understanding the\nworking of civilisations with which it\nappears to have nothing in common.\nJohn Andrews\n\n"

    "content": "JULIA IC Second at Inter Varsities Competition\nIC dancers excel\nTop team in Latin-American\nIT IS NOT often that you see\nten students with highly\ndecorative dresses and suits\nwaiting on Exhibition Road.\nIndeed, anyone passing the\nMechanical Engineering building\nat 10 o 'clock last Saturday morning might have been forgiven for\nthinking that a Rag Collection\nwas about to begin - two of the\nten were dressed remarkably\nlike Laural and Hardy.\nCloser inspection and questioning\nrevealed that the group was, in fact,\nthis year's team from imperial College Dancing Club, ready to take on the\nbest of the country's student dancers\nin the t nter Varsities Dancing Association Annual Ball and Competition.\nThis year the venue was\nExeter University (last year\nNewcastle), and the\nfeelings, wondering\nwould bring\nhave had, unfounded, as\nthe best that\nyears. Overall\n(to Liverpool\nteam\nwhat\nAny worries they might\nhowever, were totally\nto be\nit was had mixed\nthe night\ntheir performance was IC has offered for many\nthe team came second\nthe firm favourites and\nlast year's winners). In the Latin American dances, they were unsurpassed,\nand individually scored two 1st's, two\n2nd's, one 6th place, and the two\nremaining couples both got into the\nsemi-finals.\nThe team events., where each college is allowed to enter just one couple,\nare the Quickstep, the Jive, the Waltz,\nand the ChaCh aCha. Then, in addition,\nthere is the individual event, this\nyear the Paso Doble, where three\ncouples may be entered by each college. Our team, regularly to be seen practicing\nin the J CR, included two couples new\nto competition dancing, Les Harris and\nRosE mps on, and John Scouthem and\nMarie-Claire Bell izzi, whose performances\nagainst experienced opposition were a credit to them and IC. In the waltz, Alan Attwood and Jane Patti son took a second to Manchester's couple, and\nTim Rodemark and Sue Venner positively\nexcelled in the Jive, storming home to\nvictory ahead of the hot favourites,\nLiverpool (on account of his straight\nRight-arm?) ( Ed's note: that was an\nin-joke.). Brian Percival, President of\nthe IC Dancing Club, and his partner,\nSandra Tate, took an equally deserved\ngold in the ChaCh aCha, again pushing\nLiverpooHnto second place.\nThe Paso Doble (dance Of the\nBullfighers) was chosen by the IVO A as this year's individual event, and we\nentered the maximum of three couples. Here Liverpool did come out on top,\nand our couples could manage only\nsecond and sixth places, the third\npair (John and Marie-Claire) doing\nvery well for their first competition by\ngetting a place in the semi-finals.\nThen there was the 'Offbeat' \u2014' a free\nchoice of movement, with or without\nmusic, and where (quite literally) 'any-thing goes'. This is usually considered\nthe most entertaining part of the\ncompetition, and entries this year\nincluded routines to ' The Entertainer'\n(by Cambridge), ' Big Spender' (by\nLiverpool), and our very own, ' Trail of\n\"NAG\"-a student campaign for a new world order\n\" THE WAY BRITAIN trades\nwith other countries allows us to live well while others\nstarve.\" That assertion, quoted\nfrom their own leaflet, is\nthe motivation for a new\ncampaign entitled \" NAG \u2014\nthe New order for the world\nAction Group. It is a timely\ncampaign because this May\nin Nairobi, the 147 members\nof the United Nations will be meeting to discuss all\naspects of international\ntrade, especially as they\naffect the development of the\nnon-industrialised nations.\nThese countries are of\ncourse the ones with the\nmost intense and chronic\npoverty, and with the most\nfragile economies, often\nbased on the export of only\none or two raw materials.\nUnfortunately their share\nof world trade has drastically\ndeclined in the past twenty\nyears, as described in the\nNAG leaflet: \" In1950, the\nThird World, with two-thirds\nof the world's population,\nhad one-third of the world's trade. By 1971 their share\nhad shrunk to less than a sixth. Meanwhile, the prices\nthe poorer countries were\npaying for their imports rose\nfaster than the prices they got\nfor their exports. Tanzania, for example, had to sell5.3 tons of cotton and 17.3\ntons of sisal( a fibre used\nfor making rope, mats, etc) in\n1965 to buy one tractor; by\n1972 that same tractor cost\nher the equivalent of 8 tons\nof cotton and 42 tons of sisal.' That is the kind of problem\nbeing confronted by NAG, along with several organisations in Britain such as\nThird' World First, Christian\nAid, War on Want and the\nWorld Development Movement,\nall of whom are taking\npolitical or educational action\nto ensure that the British Government plays a fuller\nrole at that conference\nthan it might otherwise do,\nand that more and more people\nin Britain become aware of\nthe importance of the conference 'or them in the light\nof the needs and the rights of\npeople elsewhere.\nThere is little doubt\nthat the present system of\nworld trade will be changing\ndrastically, if only because\nof the power and inspiration\nof OPEC. The whole rusty\nand unjust machine needs\nto be dismantled and rebuilt\nto serve the needs of the\npoorest nations. Britain is\nmore likely to recommend a new coat of paint and a touch\nof oil here and there, and\nthat is where NAG and the\nothers come in. For details\nof what Britain could and\nshould do, and what you\ndo to promote it, contact\nPaul Hodges, NAG260 High\nRoad, London N154AU.T el.8 G853411, or John Shade,\n(National Secretary, World\nDevelopment,), Room 45 Beit\nHall.

Added to this,\nstrong finishing by the second\nteam enabled them to move\nabout Vets into a respectable\neighth position, so retaining\ntheir status for another season\nas a first division team. The\nfate of the third team was\nsealed; relegation a fait\nac comp li, though they did\nmanage to raise themselves\noff bottom place.\nThe race itself was run in\nnear perfect conditions, and\nmost runners took the\nopportunity to record personal\nbests. Rob All in son won his\nsecond league race on the\ntrot(sic), in 26.52, winning\nby over half a minute. Steve\nWebb (28.22) and Ian Ellis(28.55) were other first\nteam ers recording best times.\nFor the second team, Ian\nIsherwood (30.48) and Alan\nLeakey (39.59) clocked times\nwhich were some way beyond\ntheir previous bests. Even\nthe third team, whose\nphysical fitness is usually\nproportional to the week's alcoholic consumption,\nshowed that they too were\nnot averse to stretching their\nlegs faster than walking pace.\nNotable was Martin Tarnowski\n(33.33) and Pete Johnson,\nwho reserves his better runs\nfor worse conditions. They\nsaw to it that the third team\nhad some moral support at the\nback of the race. PS Thanks\nto Squeeler Morrison and Bill Jackson for officiating.\nOne could have been\nexcused for thinking that the\norganisers had changed the\ndata and venue of the annual\nBrighton run, if one had\nwitnessed the veteran cars\nwhich conveyed us to the\nfinal Courages League\nfixture at Oxford, on Saturday.\nThis league comprises\nuniversity and college teams\nfrom all over the South of\nEngland, the standard being\na couple of notches above\nthe London Colleges League.\nThe course consisted of 2\nlaps of 2Vi miles, a long\nlevel stretch followed by a plunge down the side of a hillside and the final mile\nof the lap consisting of\nseveral steep ascents in order\nto get back to the top of the\ndamned hill and then to repeat\nthe same dose.\nThe race was won in\n23.10, Rob All in son being\nfirst IC runner home in 6th place \u2014 fortunately, a couple\nof guest Frogs had j ux tu posed themselves between 1st and\n6th, and hence did not count\nin the individuals overall\npositions. This devious ploy\nenabled Rob to gain the\ntrophy as the leading overall\nrunner in the four league\nLACROSSE\nNo shame in defeat\nCambridge Eagles 18 v Imperial College 7\nAFTER THE victory against\nBuckhurst Hill, Imperial\nCollege travel l led to Cambridge. For a pleasant change we\nhad a full team.\nThe match got underway\npromptly at 2.45, and within\nthe first minute it was\nobvious who' was going to\nwin. Although Cambridge's stick handling was not much\nbetter than IC's, they fought\nso hard for every ball that\nit felt like playing a team of\nfifteen players. At the end\nof the first quarter Cambridge\nled 5 - 1 .\nIn the second quarter the\ndefence tried as hard as\npossible but they found it\nvery difficult to get the\nmatches. George Si veil\n(Gateshead N, QE C& IC) ran\nhome in 20th closely followed\nby Ian Ellis(21) and Steve\nWebb (25). This close packing\nenabled the first team to\nfinish fourth in the league,\nand after much discussion as to whether we were a college/ university we were\nawarded lots of trophies for\nbeing the leading college,\ntho' no-one really wanted\nthem. The evening was spent\nsampling Hook Norton,\nMorlands, Wadworths, Morrells,\nand probably a few others\n(but I can't remember).\nBoom careers\nTHERE IS a big future for\nthose who like making booms:\nsonic booms, atomic booms,\nfinancial booms. The career\nracks glisten with seductive\npamphlets attracting the\nfinal year student into\ndesigning missiles, nuclear\nreactors and a few other\nthings we would arguably\nbe better off without like plastic food, faster cars etc.\nThe cheap labour rates\nand repression in South Africa are still enough tor tor tunes to be made in mining and so\na few white experts will be\nwelcome there every year, or\nin London where, lor example,\nthe delightful Consolidated\nGoldfields have their base,\nnicely remote from the\nmisery they are involved in. Everyone no doubt has\ntheir own personal list of\n\" nas ties\" \u2014 areas in which\nthey will not work for love\nor money. It would be\ninteresting to find out how\nfar such lists would overlap\nat Imperial College, and\nperhaps an inkling of this\ncould be gained through the\ncolumns of FELIX? What\nwould be your \"top ten\" of\ncompanies or other institutions\nor fields which you consider\nLEAST WORTHWHILE and\nfor a second list, what are\nthe ones you consider to be\nlikely to make the MOST\nWORTHWHILE contribution In\nsolving present or future\nproblems facing the planet,\nyour continent, country, race,\netc.\nSo write in to FELIX with\nyour lists. If enough are\nreceived to warrant it, an\ninterim pair of \" top tens\" will be published to invite\nfu/ther controversy!\nCROQUET\n'na few months time the\nBritish summer will be with\nus and once again Queen's Tower will echo to the crack\nof croquet mallet against\nball, followed by a few well\nchosen words as a player\nfai Is to make a hoop.\nThe Clubs playing season\nstarts in the summer term\nwith. coaching sessions, informal matches . between\nClub members and for the\nmore enthusiastic, team\nmatches against other clubs\nin the London League. I might add, one of those well\nknown provincial universities,\nOxford, have challenged us to\na match.\nWe are very fortunate in\nhaving Professor BG Neal\nfor our president, for he was\nopen Champion in 1972 and\n'73 and must be one of the\nball into attack. The attack,\nwhen they got the ball, didn't fare much better and had\nlots of problems keeping\npossession. So it turned into\na very defensive game on\nIC's part. The Six Million Dollar man scored three\ngoals, but un fortuna tpi v his\nbionic brain then seized up.\nRichard Forster and Mike\nBurke did manage to save\nIC's face, both of them\nscoring a couple of good\ngoals.\nMeanwhile back in defence\nBill Jackson and Rob\nMorrison did very well, breakin q up many of Cambridge's attacks. But not\ne nou gti. Finally in the last\nquarter Pete MacDonald in\ngoal got back to his usual\nform and made some excellent\nsaves.\nThis left the final score\n18\u20147 in Cambridge's favour.\nHowever I think IC did very\nwell against a side who\ncould hold their own in the\ndivision above. Everybody\ndid as well as they could\nand there's no shame in\nthis defeat.\nTeam:- P MacDonald, B Jackson, Ft Morrison, B Strangeway (Capt), R Forster,\nM Smeaton, S Austin Mark 547,\nP Jepson, M Burke, P Watson.\nCongratulations FELIX, on behalf of its\nreaders, would like to\ncongratulate MR RI ZSH A KIR and M 'SS ALISON YEOMAN S on their recent\nengagement and wish them\nevery happiness and success in the \"u ture. best players of the game\ntoday.

He may\nnot appreciate that I was responsible for\norganising the debate and that I did\ncheck that Mr M inn is was available a few days before. In the intervening\nperiod however he received a mandate\nfrom his Council or U GM not to attend\nmeetings outside Aston when there\nare University Committee meetings.\nHe could not come after this, and he\nfailed to notify me.\nSecondly may I assure you that had\nthe vote looked close to me, or had it\nappeared that the count was inaccurate\nI would not have hesitated to ask for a recount. Finally I am a little disappointed\nthat Mr Stuart chose to air this in\nFELIX rather than come and talk to me\nMutters\nHAVING been snowed under with work\nrecently, FELIX has been ignored by\nyours truly.

There is just\nSOMEONE said to me a few days ago.\n\" You know, this is the biggest load of\ntroublemakers IC has sent to an NUS conference for some time\". I can see\nwhat he meant. Pete Teague, the\nbiggest stirrer around and an excellent\npublic speaker, Nick Brayshaw, an\nindividual never afraid to speak his mind (loudly) - it is rumoured that he\nwill be taking the Mines brain cell to\nconference. Tony Fitzgerald, who\ncaused a bit of trouble at the last\nconference in the debate on NUS Travel\nRick Parker, our A AO, who caused some\ntrouble for Ms Sue Slipman, NUS national secretary, at the Postgraduate\nconference and was then elected to the\nNUS Postgraduate Advisory Group. I am\nsure that he will have something to say\nabout PG grants and on his education\nmotion. The fifth delegate, sometimes\nknown as \" The Mole\", tells me that he\nintends to dig deeply into the NUS Constitution (again).\nOur observers are Nigel Miller,\nAdrian Sudworth and Hugh Barrett,\nnext year's External Affairs of tice r. They will keep an eye on the NUS Executive while the delegates are\nmano eur ve ring in smoke-filled rooms to\n\" composite\" motions, that is,\namalgamate motions with common\nviewpoints.\nThe motions on which IC has\nspeaking/compositing rights are:- NUS Constitution, Grants, Hall Fees, Welfare,\nEducation and the Bucharest Beano.\nFeel free to discuss with the delegates\nany of these matters; they are all very\napproachable and mine is a pint of IPA please. about it. I do not feel that a college wide ballot would be useful unless accompanied by a lengthy publicity\ncampaign so that people could make\nan informed decision. Anyone can of\ncourse propose a motion to aUG M that\nwe hold a referendum, and we will. Hall Rents\nThe annual round of estimates for\nthe coming session has started, and\nincluded in this are the residence\nestimates. No decision has yet been\ntaken on rent levels for next year but\nif the accounts are to break even it\nseems that another increase of about\n2 0 - 2 5 % will be necessary. I have\nadopted the attitude that any charges\nmade should be consistent with the\nstudent grant, and I intend to maintain\nthis position. I will keep you informed\non how things are going. Pete\none batch of elections to go through,\nand the posts concerned are:-Floor Reps: These \" officers without\nportfolio\" sit on ICU Council, and do\nnot have specific areas of responsibility. UL U Rep: He/ she sits on UL U Student\nRepresentative Council as IC's rep.\nThere are also vacancies for members\non the Haldane Library Committee,\nPublications Board and Accommodation\nCommittee.\nThe papers go up today in the\nUnion Lower Lounge. If you want a strong Union next year, please think\nabout standing.\nWorking Party on Union Response\nThe next meeting of interested\nparties will be on Tuesday next at\n12.35pm in Pete Teague's office. If you\nare concerned over whether the Union\nis responsive to your needs, come\nalong and voice your opinions.\nThat's it for now. My thanks to\nJune and Georgia in the Health Centre\n(things are happening).\nCheers, John\nRegarding the NUS Constitution, I received a visit last Friday from a member of Exeter College, Oxford.\nThe object of the visit was to convey\nthe thanks of the Oxford Colleges for\nthe IC motion on Central Representation.\nICU has thoroughly discussed direct\nelections and a number of other issues on which we feel that NUS could be\nimproved, that is, made to represent\nus and fulfil its proper role. This was\nendorsed at the last Union meeting by\nthe motion that the ICU Executive should\ndo all in its power to get these changes\nthrough conference. The Executive\nand myself are devoting a lot of time and\neffort to this campaign.\nI was pleased to see a few more\npeople on the last NUS demo, and I would like to point out that it was condemned by a number of Conservative\nStudents) makes an annual submission\nto the DES on the matter, but because\nthe demo was also said to be a protest\nagainst the Government's economic\nPolicy. The fact that the NUS Executive oppose the policies of the Labour\nParty shows that the Broad Left are\nnot as broad as they pretend to be.\nOne amusing incident from the\ndemonstration; we were marching down\nOxford Street chanting \" Charles Clarke out\" when a young lady from the group\nin front turned round and asked \"Who\nis Charles Clarke?\"!! The NUS are currently very worried\nabout Scottish Universities after the\nfirst \" Broad\" Left \" controlled\"( ie\ninfiltrated) Union, Strathdyde voted to\nleave NUS, they being the third union\nto d is affiliate in Scotland. NUS intend\nto set up a Scottish Union, which\nprobably explains the occur en ce of\n\" devolution\" motions at a number of\nrecent policy conferences \u2014 grasping\nat straws, perhaps?\nOne source of worry for both NUS and IC Union is the problem of communicating its activities to students. At the\nsuggestion of Rick Parker, you should\nnow find photocopies of NUS Main\nMailings on Union and J CR notice\nboards. Pla se read them \u2014 in the\ncurrent issue there are a number of\njuicy items, viz, the free booklet\nissued by NUS explaining why Iceland\nshould have a200 mile fishing limit.\nThere is also the usual stuff about\nexpenses paid (by us) trips to Eastern\nEurope by NUS hacks such as Charles Clarke. There is also some data on\nOverseas Students which you may find\ninteresting.\nI should also like to point out that\nmeetings of all IC Union Committees\nand Council meetings are open to all\nstudents, unless we vote to go into\nclosed session which is very rare,\nsince very few observers ever attend.\nAll of you are welcome to External\nAffairs meetings. Unfortunately these\nare usually called at short notice so\nit is rather impractical to advertise\nthem in FELIX, although I shall try to\ndo so; therefore you should phone the\nUnion and ask Jen, who has the information on all meetings at her fingertips.\nThe next Council is on Monday at 6.00pm and the next External Affairs meeting\nis on March 22nd at 1.00pm. At the end of a week of several\nsocial functions and both pre \u2014 and\npost - electoral consumption of alcohol, the one event which stands out is the\nICWA Ball and I would like to express\nmy appreciation of the work put in\nby the ICWA committee to make this\nsuch a success, and to Enid Glitter\nfor bringing a hip flask of Southern\nComfort with which to sustain the\nrevellers after the bar shut; and congratulations to Paul on his new haircut\n(who said \" what about yours''\")\nDerrick Everett\n\n"

    "content": "FOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCITY BOY AT RCS FANCY DRESS PARTY No. 415 Friday 12th March, 1976 FREE! NUS hits\nout on fees\nrefund\nTHE NUS (National Union of\nStudents) today demanded\nthe refund of tuition fees\npaid by students on teacher's training courses. This follows\nthe decision by Birmingham\nPolytechnic to return fees\npaid by second and third\nyear students. Last December\nthe students received letters\ndemanding payment of tuition\nfees within ten days. This\nfollowed the re-classification\nof the grant status of trainee\nteachers in 1975.\nPreviously, tuition was free for trainee teachers\nprovided the student fulfilled\nthe conditions for receiving\na grant. After September\n1975, students in colleges\nof education had the same\nentitlement to a grant as those\nin Universities and Polytechnics. One side effect of\nthis change is that student\nteachers in residence at\ncolleges of education are\nexpected to pay tuition fees\nif their parents earn in\nexcess of \u00a34000.\nDearing for C&G Morrell for RCS\nUpon learning this,\nBirmingham Polytechnic Students' Union occupied\ntheir college last December\nand also sent a solicitor's letter to the Polytechnic authorities saying that they\nbelieved a breach of contract\nhad taken place, by levying\nfees half-way through a course,, The Polytechnic agreed, and has refunded\nfees to second and third\nyear students. What angers\nthe NUS is that only those\nstudents who protested will get any money back.\nCharles Clarke, NUS president said today \"It is yet another example which\nwe will use to persuade the\nGovernment to accede to our\ncase for giving full cash grants to all students \"\nHe added, \"It is quite\nindefensible for the poly-technic. author i ties to refund\ntuition fees to some students\nand not to others. To refund\nonly those students who\nprotested against the charge\nin the first place and\nexclude those who paid\nwillingly, but with difficulty,\nis a travesty of justice. Levy for Mines\nTHE THREE C CU presidents\nfor the academic year 1976\u20147\nwill be Steve Dearing of City and Guilds; Martin\nLevy RS M and Chris Morrell\nof RCS. Mr Dearing and Mr\nLevy were elected by General\nmeetings of their respective\nUnions yesterday. A meeting\nof R CSU, on the same day, ratified the election of Ms Morrell, who was unopposed.\nThe other C CU officers\nelected were as follows; Vice President of Guilds, D Lord; of RS MU,M Osborn\nand of RCS U,S Braund.

    "content": "Inconsistency cause of poor season\nTHE END of the UC TBA league saw\nBrunei as winners and Portsmouth as\nrunners-up in the Southern division. After last terms defeats IC were\ndetermined to make a greater effort in\ntheir two remaining home games. For the Portsmouth game IC were fortunate\nto have John Ba colin i for UC to play\nfor the first' s. This allowed other players\nto play in their true positions, in the\nseconds. Both UC players showed\ntheir class. John scoring a607 series\nand Derek Mills a499. Unfortunately\nthey were not backed up by the IC players\nand as a result the first's lost all\nthree games.\nHaving John Dereck to play in the\nfirst' s, released players to the second's and this, combined with consistent\nplay from other players, meant that IC\nwon two games and the series giving\nthem two points on the UC TBA league.\nRob Sharman displayed the style now\nexpected from him and finished with a490 series, truly a first team performance.\nThe third teams performance was\nless than spectacular. In fact three of\nthe team did not even beat the blind\nscore series; in other words IC would\nhave done better with a two man team.\nAll teams are capable of 400 series\nand this kind of play has cost IC\nmany points this season.\nThe Ladies team were once again\nunder strength. The four regulars Anne,\nMans y, Julie and Briony started slowly. They lost the first game but came back\nto win the second. Unfortunately they\ncould not muster the same hatred for the\nopposition as they did against Brunei\nand lost 2 games and the series. The\nlack of several reliable lady bowlers\nhas plagued IC this season. These four\nhowever, with their vastly different\nstyles have been IC's most successful team this season and thanks are\nextended to them for their regular\nappearance.\nThe result of the Pompey match was\ntherefore 2 - 8 , which could easily have been reversed if the rp had been\nAnne Holt and Alison Halstead about to roll\nMansy Laine in action\nsome consistent bowling. Having been\nso close to beating Portsmouth it seemed\nthat with one last effort IC could beat\nSouthampton the following week.\nAll IC teams arrived in good time,\nsuitably kit ted out in our new shirts,\non lanes, ten minutes before the\nscheduled roll-off. Although the opposition had confirmed the fixture long in\nadvance they just did not turn up. So\nIC decided to play out the game without\nthe opposition.\nThe final league position showed\nIC with 13 out of a possible 60 points\nand last in the southern division of the\nUC TBA league. Our lack of success s, could be due to many reasons but it is\nblatantly obvious that the inconsistency\nof some players has resulted in many\nlost matches. If all IC's players were\nsimply to bowl their usual average\nperformances then they would have\nwon many more points on the league.\nAnother reason was that IC lack three\nor four really good bowlers. To win\nfirst team matches, five bowlers scoring\n500 series are essential. The top\nscoring bowler in our league has an\naverage of around 150 and this is simply\nnot first team standard.\nThe following week saw the Brunei\ndoubles competition in which IC entered\nfour teams. Some above average play\nmeant that all three teams in the\nhandicap section finished within the\nfirst ten. The first place had been\nawarded to the captain and Peter\nHulatt but unfortunately a mistake had\nbeen made by the organisers who\ncredited them with 100 pins too many.\nHaving pointed out this fact, the\nappropriate corrects were made and\nthey finished sixth, just seven pins\nabove Ann Holt and Paul Bart left.\nAnne playing with her usually high\nstandards, reached fourth position in\nthe ladies game and a marvelous second\nIn the ladies series table.\nDuring the Annual General Meeting\nthe new constitution was accepted and\nnext years committee was ratified.\nThen followed the presentation of\nof achievement awards. Paul received\na225 chevron, Clive and EffnnHi\n200 chevrons and\nfriTo^or s lf of s badges.\nwere awarded to bowlers who, \u2022 the\ncaptain felt had made a notable\ncontribution to the club. They were\npresented to the four regular ladies\nteam members, Anne for her 470 series and Mansy and Julie for their 164 and\n163 games respectively. For his consistently good work in the firsts, so\noften with no reward, Dereck also received an award. Paul won the\nhigh game award and Clive the high\nseries. Last week in the internal league,\nwhen the first's played the second's Clive, Julie and Nigel became this\nyears league champions. The averages\ntable was won by Paul Bartlett with an\naverage of 150 over the series.\nCongratulations to all who won\nawards and best wishes to the club for next year.\nSometime bowlers:-DMills, JBaccolini, PBartlett, C Dutton,\nT Phillips, F Karimadeh, P Russet, J Mason, J Pridham, A Conway, R Neal,\nE Rahman, S Spurrier, C Nlkel, R Sharman, C McCulley, R Mundy;\nLadies: A Holt, B Marsden-Jones, J Robinson, M Laine, A Halstead, S Wilson.\nDavid Zaborski\nPublic auction\nLET IT BE KNOWN that the Editor\nof FELIX, being shorn and devoid\nof hair, shall offer, for SALE BY AUCTION, that which has been\nremoved'.

    "content": "8 FIIIX\nReviews\nCinema\nALEXANDER WALKER, in his book\non Stanley Kubrick and his films,\nattributes this director's undoubted skill to a unique conceptual ability which\nmakes each of his films a new concept\nIn cinema. 'Barry Lyndon' has made\nuse of some innovator y techniques,\nnotably in photographing scenes lit\nby candle-light alone, but I have failed\nto see any new concept emerging from\nthis film. It is very beautiful, indeed\nit has been described as being like a moving Gainsborough picture, and I agree. Running through this is a deliberately simple story. Ironically\nthe film is so perfect that it appears\nalmost mechanical, but there again all\nthe characters are rather nasty stereo-types. This may seem rather retrospective\nas 'Barry Lyndon' has been out for some\ntime; another film that has been 'out'\nfor some time (1954 in fact) but is only\nnow being shown in this country, is\nthe Japanese classic\"S an shoD ayu\"( Sansho the Bailiff) by Kenji Mizo g uchi. Like Kubrick' s film it is very\nbeautiful and tells a simple story, set\nin the barbaric, feudal times of 11th century (Heian Period) Japan. The Mechanical, haunting, convincing\nlegend is an heroic tale of a brother\nand sister kidnapped whilst travelling\nwith their mother, and sold into slavery\nunder the savage tyrant, Sansho. After\nten years in captivity, the brother, now\nadult, escapes and goes in search of his mother. Although heroic, it is also, as\nthe film's introduction tells us,a pathetic tale \u2014 whatever they do,\nwhatever principles they try to uphold,\nthey eventually and sadly, become\nvictims of the period they live in. Mizoguchi's atmospheric use of landscape\nis, to use ac liche, haunting. Throughout\nthe film he uses the subtle tones of\ngrey (for it is in 'black and white')\nin the benign and tranquil scenery, as\ncontrasting backdrop to the malignant\nand bestial behaviour of man. The scene I most remember is where the\nchildren are separated from their mother;\nthey are tricked into getting into\ndifferent boats floating on a mirror-calm sea and, to the sound of each\nothers screams, disappear in opposite\ndirections into the mists. 'Sansho\nDayu' is showing at The Gate, Notting\nHill \u00a31.30 or 80p before 3pm.( You\nget a short too - an artistic experiment\nDavid Thompson\nin colour environment; music by Pink Floyd \u2014 interesting).\nThe Electric Cinema Club usually\nshows films for two or three days only,\nbut on March 7th it began a season\nfeaturing a film that had its British\npremiere at the 1975 London Film Festival; 'Story of S in' by the Polish director, Walerian Borowczyk. This is the first film by this director that I have seen - I hope it's not the last.\nHe had one other film at this year's festival \u2014 ' The Beast' and one at\nlast year's 'Immoral Tales'. As you\nmight have surmised from these titles\nthe theme is sex, and how it controls\npeople. Briefly (and un shamed ly plagiarist ic ally) 'Story of S in' is the\nstory of a fallen virgin, a victim of\nevil people and a dirty world filled\nwith ineffective social workers, dukes,\ncheats and pimps. A world where any\nstep from the accepted moral values\ncan never be retraced and each step\nleads further into the murky depths.\nI was not entirely convinced that the\ngirl is the trapped innocent she appears\nto be, but the stages from virgin to\nwhore are so well Dlended, that they\nmake the whole very convincing. Music Deodato - First Cuckoo (MCA)\nGood music\nANOTHER DE ODA TO ALB U Mreleased about a month ago \u2014 and, as\nusual, it's a good cut above the rest\nof the debris getting released. A few unnecessary tracks, a few goodies,\nand one superlative number. Of course\nit receives as much publicity and\nattention as his previous four albums \u2014\nnegligible.\nThe unnecessary tracks are the\nripped-off \" Black Dog\", transferred\npractically note-for-note from you-know-where and supposedly written by Gene\nPage, Robert Plant, and John Jones( Tch, T chl), and the title track by one\nFrederick Delius, again sticking very\nclosely to the original and sounding\nout of place on the LP. The goodies include\" Funk Yourself\",\" Crab walk\", and \"Watusi\nStrut\" (Deodato Compositions) and\nOgden Nash/ Kurt Weill is\" Speak low\" all well up to his high standards in\ngently-jazzed sophistication whatever\nthe songs' original backgrounds.\nThis is easy listening of the highest\nquality. Like a long smooth drink, you\nknow it's there all the time but without\nunpleasant jagged edges or after-tastes.\nThen there is the one truly superb\nsong. This is Marcos Valle is\" Adam's Hotel\" and it immediately stands\no \u00bbt as something special. One of the\nsoftest, most delicate songs, beautifully\nflowing and fragile, words don't do it\njustice. The uncluttered electric\npiano solo is a pure delight. You could play this song on almost any\ninstrument and it would sound great.\nSo, another one passes on it's way, barely noticed but leaving the\npleasure of \" Adam's Hotel\". Some\npeople make music, some become\nfamous. The lucky few achieve both.\nEumir Deodato just makes good music. Leon Red bone \u2014 On The Tracks\n(Warner Bros.)\nThe ultimate\nlong shot\nWHAT IS THIS?? You may well ask. And I did. Answer: It's just a standard\ntwelve inch record, round, although the\nhole doesn't seer ff quite drilled in the\nmiddle, black (no reference whatsoever\nto it's ancestors), and fashioned in the\nmodern style (ie warped and razor-thin).\nOh, and it's positively horrible.\nLeon Redbone comes on like an\nelderly Southern states yodeller intent\non becoming irrefutable proof, of life\nafter death, but he' d settle for the\nposthumous \" Groucho Marx sings Ring\nCrosby\" award for 1837 (a good year for\nstiffs). Looking like a cross pollinated\nhybrid of Frank Zappa and General\nCuster sporting an oh so nouveau chic railway man's cap and wall to wall\ncigar smoke he croons and warbles his way through the most spl end if ero us selection of your favourites and mine,\nvisa vi s,\"Ain't Mis be ha v in'\",\" Lazybones\", ad nausea m. He sounds bored,\na hardly surprising state of the nation.\nOn the sleeve is an acknowledgement\ncredit to Jelly Roll Morton and Jimmy\nRodgers \" for their music' , who presumably\ncould do better than this. If you want\nto hear some serious blues/ gospel sounds, then Taj Mahal, on say \" A step further\", would be amply more\nrewarding than the aural wonderment\nhere displayed. To think that Warners have put money\nbehind such a project is pretty mind-boggling and as far as albums go,\nthis is the ultimate long shot. Of course,\nthe whole dilemma would be explained\nif it were Jonathan King in disguise. But then some unfortunates would\nprobably listen to it.\nHIC\nBooks\nSolzhenitsyn. Matryona's House\nand other stories'. (Penguin)\nSOLZHENITSYN is now a household\nname In both the West and the East by Virtue of his criticism of Soviet\nRussia. This notoriety has possibly\nbeen to the detriment of his reputation\nas a writer; another reason is that\nhis best known works, for example the\nGulag Archipelago, tend to be rather\nlong and, arguably, heavy going.\nHowever, anyone who in the past may\nhave been reluctant to sample his large-scale books can now try this\nselection of short stories and prose-poems, and realise what an amazing\nwriter this much-persecuted blok e is. He writes with a deep-rooted affection\nfor the country he has been expelled\nfrom, and seems to understand the\npeople more than any other writer on\neither side of the Iron Curtain. Each of\nthese stories and reflections is a separate chunk out of his vast experience\nof the Russian development; experience\nwhich includes eight years in prison\ncamps. Solzhenitsyn is a writer in the\nmodem vein (which possibly started\nwith James Joyce) in that he seeks\nto portray a certain section of civilisation as completely as possible; and if this\nincludes facets which are shocking or\nunpleasant in any way, then they have\nto be included along with the good\nsides. As his society has had a difficult\ndevelopment there is more of the bad\nand the ugly in these pages than the\ngood; but do not let this deter you. This is writing of distinct worth; a huge perceptiveness coupled with an\nequally huge feeling for language.\nFurther book reviews\nand the theatre reviews\ncan be found on p10. "
