Inspired by this\nRSM started to play some decent football and\nbar a few misunderstandings between the ref\nand the laws, RSM managed to score the first\ngoal, well taken by T Hanker. This brought\nRCV (and the ref) to action and for a while\nRSM defended well though not well enough\nsince RCV scored to make the goal tally\nequal. With the ref now venturing from the\ncentre circle both teams were spurred on to\neven greater efforts by this show of\nconfidence, and soon after RSM got another\ngoal, this time from James W. Football Seconds\nTWO BEDFORD goals mid-way through the\nsecond half made IC fight to win a match\nwhich should have been won easily.\nIC dominated the first half, without creating\nmany clear cut chances and at half-time the\nscore was 0-0.\nSoon after the break, however, Clarke shot\nfiercely from a narrow angle to give IC the\nlead. The team began to play with confidence\nand went further ahead when Veenman\nslotted his shot past the approaching keeper.\nTwo well taken Bedford goals, drew the\nscore level at 2-2.\nWith the possibility of a draw against such\nmediocre opposition, IC stepped up the effort\nonce more and regained the lead when Carr\nheap fe'd a lose ball over a stranded keeper. IC\nfinally finished off the opposition when a shot\nfrom Niccolls entered the net.\nTEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,\nMacDonald, Griffiths, Carr, Niccolls,\nVeenman, Clarke, Saunders.\nGuilds Hockey\nAFTER a well-contested start in which\nGoldsmiths looked a competent team, Forbes\nopened the scoring with rather a limp shot. In\nminutes, Guilds were two up with a short\ncorner put away by Andy Liles. Guilds\npressed forward and were rewarded by a somewhat dubious goal from Gray. Goldsmiths lost a man at half-time and Guilds\ncontrolled the game for the rest of the match,\nwith Andy Liles completing his hat-trick from\nshort corners. Andy Garms and Chris Liles\nalso netted in neat solo efforts. Guilds missed\na lot of chances but overall it was a good team\neffort.\nTEAM: Hancox, Shaw, Rao, Black, Eldridge,\nLiles A, Forbes, Garms, Gray, Liles C. Driver\nand ref, Webb P. Compiled by\nPhil Webb,\nSports Editor.\nSaturday, Nov 1\nRCS Rugby\nSINCE so many people want to play in our\none team, it was decided to play a Saturday\nmatch for those people who weren't regulars.\nA team of 12 eventually took the field\nagainst an ageing 14-man BP team. Phil\nMorgans and Ian Mawer proved to be too fast\nfor the opposition backs, and were rewarded\nwith three and one tries respectively.\nMorgans proved as elusive in the bar as he\nwas on the field, and avoided buying a hattrick jug. Dave Fenton scored his first (and\nprobably last) try of the season, three\nconversions and a penalty were kicked by\nSkipper Latham. Chris Boyd made his\npresence felt in the back row, and was not\nresponsible for either of the two tries scored\nagainst us.\nWe spent a pleasant hour in the clubhouse\nafter the match, and my thanks to those\nheroes who turned out: Edwards, Curnock,\nO 'Doherty, Pilgrim, Morgans, Mawer,\nLatham, Pearce, Fenton, Ellwitt and two\nSmiths.\nFootball Sevenths\nTHE NEWLY FORMED IC VII team slammed\nseven goals past LSE Vths in a73 victory.\nThe team quickly began to perform as a well\ncoordinated unit, putting LSE under pressure. IC went two nil up with fine goals\nfrom Bartolomasi and Martin. At this stage\nLSE staged a comeback, and as IC relaxed\nthey scored three quick goals to lead 3-2 at\nhalf-time, having forced Rijnbeek into making\nto fine saves.\nAs the second half wore on IC gained a stranglehold on midfield, where the main\nbattle was being fought, and were able to set\nup many attacks with only twenty minutes\nremaining Caseau levelled with a header.\nThen Milner put IC 4-3 up. Further goals from\nMilner and centre-half Haberlin (2) ensured\nan emphatic win for IC. This was a good,\nconfident display from IC VII and demo-st rates the high quality of football at IC this\nyear.\nTEAM: Rijnbeek, Wilson (sub Bird),\nMaynard, Know, Haberlin, Caseau, Gaskill,\nMartin (sub Twyford), Milner, Bartolomasi,\nCoussens.\nHockey Firsts\nICS THIRD GAME this season in the\nMiddlesex League turned out to be their\ntoughest fixture so far.\nFrom the start O MTs were obviously\ndetermined to get a result from this game and\nattacked hard and fast. But for the first ten\nminutes IC gave as good as they got and\n| eventually scored through a well struck shot\ncorner from Ian Crowe.\nThen IC made the mistake of relaxing and\nby half-time OMTs had been allowed control\nof the game and had scored twice to take the\nlead.\nPositional changes at half-time strengthened IC's midfield and saw them gradually\nclaw their way back into the match. About\nfifteen minutes from the end, IC levelled the\nscore with a perfectly executed short corner\nthrough Ian Crowe.\nFor the last ten minutes IC really dominated\nthe match and were unlucky several times not\nto score the winning goal.\nTEAM: Webb, Crowe, Hughes, Coatesworth, Riley, Whitaker, Clarke, Franklin,\nGatley, Ayres, Rich.\nHockey Seconds\nTHE SECONDS extended their 100% record\nlast Saturday in a hard fought match in which\nthe IC goalkeeper was constantly kept under\nheavy pressure. IC had great difficulty in\nbreaking down a well regimented Howden\ndefence, and it was not until after thirty\nseconds that we managed to open the\nscoring.\nAfter this, despite centre forward Spanker\ndoing his best to miss the goal, IC soon\nincreased their lead, with Streaker scoring aston ker of a goal.\nThe second half started much like the first,\nwith the IC goalkeeper again being kept very\nbusy.\nFull time came with relief, the 13-0\nscore line telling the full story of what a hard\nfought battle it had been.\nSpecial mention must go to Mike Chew and\nAndy Garms who scored five goals each, ana\nto Lloyd Williams who sporting ly played in\ngoal for the opposition.\nTEAM: Williams, Parker, Rampton, Bird,\nShaw, Chew, Garms, Rao, Streaker, Gray,\nShindter, Masom.\nSquash\nAT LAST, IC Squash Club has four good\ncourts. We have four teams in the UL U leagues with a ladies' team hopefully joining\nthe ladies' league after Christmas. The\nstandard of all the teams is, as usual, fairly\nhigh, with the thirds making a very good start\nto the season. However, we have still to\nassess the ability of several people, so don't despair if you haven't played for a team yet.\nThanks to swift Jacqueline Chandler for\norganising the ladies and to all the squash\nsocialites of last Thursday.\nRichard Thompson\nIC Squash Captain\nTennis\nTHE RULES and groups for the winter round-robin tournament are now on the tennis\nnoticeboard in the Sports Centre, so get your\nmatches arranged as quickly as possible. (If\nthere are) any queries about either groups or\nthe rules please contact Tony Tsoukkas, Civ\nEng 3.\nSnooker\nTHE B TEAM returned to form and beat\nCharing Cross 3-2. S Bennett managed to\nextend his unbeaten run to two frames and is\nconfident about this week's encounter with\nthe C team. Training for all B team members\nstarts at 8:30am on Sunday morning.\nThe A team just managed to win against\nLSE 3-2. They are now in danger of early\nmorning training and losing their prestigious\nposition in the snooker league.\nA 'Doubles Tournament' is being run within\nthe next few weeks and entrants names are\nnow being taken.\nFELIX, November 7, 1980 Page 1 1\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nIt is always difficult to defend\nany illegal activity \u2014 anyone\nwho feels slightly affronted\nimmediately has a very big stick\nto beat you with. CB is illegal,\nand will remain so for a while\nyet, and I fully realise the\nimplications of its use. However,\nI am sure I am not alone in\nthinking of 'he benefits a legal\nCB would bring to the country as\nit has in many other countries.\nMy personal use of any equipment is my look-out, as I can,\nindeed, be prosecuted \u2014 just in\nthe same manner as I can be\ndone for speeding.\nMy original intention was, and\nstill is, to form a social club of\npeople interested in CB radio to\napply pressure for its legal is ation on 27MHz as soon as possible,\nrather than promote illegal\nactivity, which is up to the\nindividual.\nI have said all I want to say-about the technical side (FELIX\n564) and shall conclude this letter\nby saying that if anyone is\ninterested they can put a letter in\nthe Meeh Eng letter-racks \u2014\nunder lF\\ This is the Ferret\ngoing 10-8, 10-10.\nThe Ferret (Esq)\nReal name and address supplied.\nDear Sir\nI have been following the\ncorrespondence on CB with some\ninterest, and having strong\nfeelings on the matter actually\nwrote a letter on the subject last\nweek. As this would have required\na99 page FELIX supplement, it\nwas not printed, and so I would\nlike, having squeezed as much\nvenom and contempt out of them\nas possible, to present the main\npoints here, in the hope that they\nconstitute a reasonable summary ,\nof the pros and cons.\n1) If some form of radio\ncommunication between private\ncitizens was legal is ed, it would\nnot only be fun, but useful.\n2) The operation of imported\n27MHz CB equipment causes\ngross interference to the legal\nusers of not only the 27MHz band, but to many services\nI outside it, e.g. aircraft landing\n1\nsystems, etc (see Government\ndiscussion document ' Open Channel*).\n3) Channel 16 is not the only\none causing trouble.\n4) Radio Amateurs do not\nparticularly want \"to dominate\nthe airwaves\". We haven't got all\nthat much frequency space\nanyway, considering the number\nof people in the world who use it.\n5) For simple, friendly local\ncontacts, 2m FM should suit the\nCBers perfectly. A suitable\nlicense is very easy to obtain.\n6) Police do not automatically\nturn a blind eye to CB operation.\nIf anyone is really interested in\nradio communication and would\nlike to get involved without\ncrashing aeroplanes or old people's alarms, I would invite\nthem to come along one Wednesday afternoon to HAM SOC's little abode in the Union Building.\nTours faithfully\nJ Savage\nPhysics 3\nG8R RD Dear Sir\nI have been asked to reply to\nMatthew Hunt bach' s letter,\nprinted in FELIX no 565.\nHis letter is a hot-pot ch of\ndisconnected jottings that served\nto warn me of how liberally\nafflicted with tunnel vision a student politician can become.\nHe writes that the Government\nis not 'putting much priority on\nprofit-sharing' and 'that workers\ndo not get any direct benefit from\nbeing competitive and thus do\nnot have any incentive'.\nTraditionally firms have paid\nhigher rates for overtime and\nnow many are trying to introduce\na productivity element into their\npay se it lem ents. This is a type of\nprofit-sharing and certainly\nprovides an incentive to be\ncompetitive. There is little more\nfor the Government to do. It has\nhowever enhanced the value of\nsuch arrangements by reducing,\nat all levels, the rate of direct\ntaxation.\nHe goes on to say that monopolies can exist under private\nownership and competition under public ownership. I agree\nbut feel bound to point out that,\nin this country at least, the\nopposite is more likely to apply.\nWhere this is happening the\nGovernment is aiming to allow\nprivate enterprise to compete.\nBritish Airways is facing competition from British Caledonian anu\nair fares on national routes have\nfallen, making prices compare\nfavourably with corresponding\ntrain fares. This Government has\nalso given private coach operators\nthe chance to compete with the\nNational Bus Company. 'Inter-City' coach prices have been\nreduced, demonstrating that\nfaith in private enterprise does\nnot go un rewarded at least not\nfor you or me \u2014 the consumer.\nMatthew then goes on to say\nthat Sir Keith Joseph was\ninhumane to suggest 'that people\nshould accept lower wages to get\njobs'.\nNow an employee is unlikely to\nmove to a lower paid job. Maybe\nSir Keith meant that an unemployed person should accept\nlower wages to get a job. But an\nunemployed person receives no\nwage so, that doesn't hold. The\nimplication must therefore be\nthat an unemployed person\nshould expect to receive a lower\nwage than had previously been\nanticipated. This might be good\nadvice to those who read or hear\nabout how wage 'claims' 'could'\nresult in . . . etc. Expectations are\nbound to be raised by such\nreporting and by the exaggerated\ntalk of associates. If someone\nunemployed pays heed to Sir\nKeith's advice then his words will\nhave borne fruit indeed. Because\nthere is, as I hope Matthew is\nwell aware, more to a job than\nfinancial reward.\nIn the final paragraph it was\nclaimed that Conservative policies are 'designed to ensure\nthat real power and ownership\nlies in the hands of a small and\nprivileged elite' \u2014 rubbish.\nThe continuing intent to sell\ncouncil houses, the aim to allow\nprivate enterprise to challenge\nstate monopolies and the desire\nto switch from direct to indirect\ntaxation show that the Government is trying to give the\nconsumer more economic freedom, more choice and therefore more control. The Government still has a long way\nto go but it has set out in the\ncorrect direction.\nTours faithfully\nMark Clegg\nChairman of IC Con Soe\nDear Steve,\nI would like to reply to Mr Teeloek's somewhat emotive\nletter last week with a few points\nI consider relevant to the\nsituation:\n1) As I have previously ex-plaine d, both decisions regarding\nthe TV Lounge were made\nduring Malcolm's term of office\nand thus I had assumed he had\ninformed Snooker Club.\n2) He states \"for a long time\nnow, the room has been the\nmeeting place of Snooker Club\".\nI was not aware of this, and indeed, it should not have been so. Snooker Club have their own room, can book a committee room for an official meeting like any. other club, and certainly have no right to the room simply because it is next door to their s and was not used at lunchtime stora longtime.3) He gives the arguments used in the past and states that he\" was given a distinct impression last year that the Club would, probably begetting a table this\nyear\". I'm afraid he was misled, as last year's officers cannot control what this year's Union Finance Committee will decide after due consideration of the circumstances.4) House Committee are not my' bosom friends'( very witty!), the members are elected, two from Council, and two from the student body, i.e.. any member of Snooker Club( orI CW A for that matter) could have stood. If the committee's intention was to get rid of I CW A,I'm sure it could have done better, i.e. the ladies' toilets conform exactly to the relevant clause in the Bylaws:\" A portion of the Union Buildings shall be set as idel or the use of the members of the Imperial College Women's Association\". Iam also sure any of them is capable of proposing the appropriate By law change at aUG M.5) Union Finance Committee( of which Iam also the Chairman, i. e.Ido not have a de liber at ive vote at either Committee) is\ncomposed of the presidents of the CC Us, the Chairmen of the major subcommittees, and two ordinary members( which again anyone can stand for). All are elected by their various bodies, who presumably considered them responsible enough to\" handle roughly \u00a3 1 2 , 0 0 0 of your\nmoney\"' when they voted for the m.6)I would suggest that calling the committee\" self centred hacks\" and\" tw at s who really gel up my nose\" is not going to\npersuade them to spend \u00a3 2 , 7 5 0\non Snooker Club' stable at Major Claims on Tuesday.1 ours s inter ely Rachel S nee Dear Mr Marshall\nIam writing on behalf of Mr Morton in reply to the letter from Mess rs F'ox andO' Boyle. Mr Morton would reply himself, but he is currently attending BRAIN( British Race goers Association Inquiry on No b bing).

We would wish to\napologise for any confusion that this may have\ncaused.\nCB Radio\nThanks to the Ferret and G8RRD for their\nsumming up letters on the CB issue. The topic\nwas a new one to me and I now feel quite well\nJ formed on the subject. However, the topic is\nnow closed in the letters page.\nAunt Died re\nPlease find enclosed a new cartoon series\nentirely created from next to nothing by myself\n(artist) and Simon Turner (writ is t). We hope\nyou will find it stimulating for the rest of the\nyear and advise you to keep your back issues\nto be able to appreciate it fully. Hope you enjoy\nreading it as much as we enjoyed creating it.\nWe need you\nIf you want to come and join the happy bunch\nworking on FELIX, don't get thinking it's too\nlate, we always need people.\nWe need more people who take photos and\ndevelop them. We need photos quickly which\nmeans films have to be developed and printed\nup almost immediately. We do, of course, pay\nexpenses.\nWe need people to write news stories, paste-up pages, typeset, collate on Thursday, etc.,\netc. You need n't have any prior experience,\nyou'll pick at us as you go along.\nI would ask, though, that you bear with us;\nproducing a paper every week is very hectic \u2014\nwhile we want to attract and encourage staff\nwe also have to get the paper out. We need\nhardened souls who can cope with deadline\npanics.\nOn Thursday night, we collate FELIX, this is\nusually quite sociable (shouting above the\nnoise of the folding machine, s lagging off the\nUnion Exec, etc., etc.). Let's face it, putting\ntogether 4,000 copies of FELIX by hand is so\ndeathly boring that we have to do something to\nrelieve the tedium. This will undoubtedly\nexplain the topless dancer many of you will\nhave seen if you have passed the office on\nThursday night.\nJoin the 24-hour, nearly 7 days a week club.\nJoin FELIX and see the sun rise!\nSouthside Security Survey\nLast Monday morning at 4:00am,I conducted\na security survey of Southside. The freedom of\naccess to the building has been the subject of\nmuch discussion following the violent incident\nin Keogh last week and the rape last term.\nI have concluded that it is extremely easy for\nanyone (without a key) to gain access to\nSouthside at the moment.\nThe Keogh/Selkirk main door was locked\njust as it usually is, but the Falmouth/Tizard\ndoors were not; efficient door-closer s must be\nfitted to these doors.\nI was very surprised to see the fire escape\ndoors at the Falmouth/Tizard end actually\nback on their hinges after my editorial\ncomplaint last week. I was even more\nsurprised to see how they were locked. In the\npast, the two fire escape doors at each end of\nSouthside automatically unlocked when the\nfire bell was triggered. However, on Sunday\nand at the time of writing (Wednesday\nevening) these doors were fastened shut with a bolt attached to the inside of the door. These\nbolts were easily unlocked by slipping one's hand through the door slats from the outside,\nthus offering 24-hour easy access to\nSouthside.\nMonday morning, I phoned Captain Lindley\n(Domestic Secretary) who was unavailable for\ncomment. I then phoned Bob Foggon, Fire and\nSafety Officer who didn't like the arrangement\nfrom a safety point of view as the doors should\nautomatically open in case of fire, and not be\nbolted up. Mr Reeves, Chief Security Officer,\ntold me that all doors in College were being\nimproved from a security point of view and the\nfire-bell-triggered opening of these doors was\nat present being improved by the Estates\ndepartment, hence the temporary bolts.\nIN CONCLUSION; I find this whole\nsituation totally unsatisfactory. At the\nmoment, the doors pose a safety and security\nhazard to Southside residents. While\naccepting maintenance is necessary, it is\ntaking far too long for the Estates department\nto pull their fingers out. And putting a bolt on\nthe inside which one can open from the\noutside seems, to me at least, a pretty poor\nsubstitute for security. It would be a simple\nmatter to prevent access to the bolt from the\noutside.\nSouthside Plant\nWell, that was a wizard wheeze last week\nwasn't it? Within two hours of FELIX 'hitting\nthe streets' the offending plant had been\nwatered and someone had cut all the dead\nleaves off.\nTalk about 'Power of the Press'. Wow!\nStop Press:\nBob Foggon has informed me (Thursday) that\nis likely that the fire bell triggered doors will\ncome into operation from early next week, and\nthe bolts will be removed.\nTo meet the occasion of a fire where the\nfire bell is not triggered, a fire alarm will be'\nsituated near the escape doors.\nBlood Doninq\nI forgot to include a blood do ning ad last\nweek. Doning took place yesterday and will\nbe on today in the Union Dining Hall until\n12:00 noon and in the afternoon from 2:00pm to 4:00pm.

Beingcertain he has lent it to ot,e of his final year students, he asked\nthem about it.\nAmble said: I borrowed it from Eager at\nleast t\\ Ace, and lent it to Clumsy once. I never lent it to Bumble.\nBumble said: Whenever I lent it to Amble\nor Clumsy (and I'm not sure that I ever did) I had just borrowed it from Eager.\nClumsy said: I lent it to Bumble, Eager,\nand Fumble just once each.\nDrudge said: It passed once between each\nof the others and me.\nEager said: I lent it to Fumble once. I'm not sure if he gave it straight back, but he\nnever gave it to me on any other occasion. I never borrowed it from Bumble, but if I lent\nit to him, then I never borrowed it from the\nman who has it now.\nFumble said: It passed between me and\nBumble once. I never lent it to Amble or\nClumsy.\nThe professor drew a deep breath and\nseveral complicated diagrams, finally\nconcluding that a certain number of his\nstudents could be excluded from his list of\nsuspects.\nWhich ones?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me\nc/o FEUX Office. There will be a prize of \u00a32\nfor the first correct solution opened at noon on\nTuesday.\nLast Week's Solution\n10 and 11.\nSince Splinter could not solve the problem\nhe'was set, there are two solutions to x2+y2= k for k fixed, not divisible by 5, and less than\n260. 102\n+ ll2=142+a2=221 is the only\nsolution. If anyone can explain to me why\nthere are so many values for k which are\ndivisible by 5 (50, 65, 85, 125, 145....) but only\none value which isn't,I will be most grateful.\nIt helps to find the solution if you notice that\na2+ b2=c2+d2 if a2c2=d2 b2=(a+c)( ac)=(d+ b)(db). Lots of people assumed that \"roughly the\nsame age\" meant \"the difference in ages is one\nyear\". Although it isn't necessary to assume\nthis to solve the puzzle, it does lead to the\ncorrect answer, and offered a short cut which I hadn't bargained for. Consequently several\npeople submitted corrected entries.

Hope you missed me.\nI notice that while I 've been away\nthe RCS Broadsheet mob have snatched the op port unit v to start up their\nRumour, Crud, Scandal column. Well,\nwhat can I say? They seem to have a preoccupation with people who wear\nyellow trousers. They claim this is the\nlatest trend. Hogwash Sir! Why, I was\nwearing yellow trousers when I was in\nnappies!\nAn interesting snippet came to light the other\nday. It was learned that the Department of\nComputing owns a kosher gown for use at\nsuch occasions as Commemoration Day. We\nwere intrigued, firstly, that there is such a thing\nas a kosher gown (made of synthetic fibres)\nand, secondly, why the DoC should want to\npurchase one.\nNormally, all gowns for Commemoration\nDay are borrowed from the University of\nLondon's store; however, when Professor\nManny Lehman, head of DoC, insisted on a kosher gown they were a little slow on the\nuptake. Consequently, the DoC bought Prof\nLehman the gown out of departmental money.\nAmazing!\nA rather amusing incident occurred in dear old\nWeeks Hall recently. A Chinese student with\nan obvious concern over the scarcity of such\nwonderful accommodation had allowed a friend to share his humble abode. Not content\nwith merely risking detection of the offence, he\nmade absolutely certain that his charitable act\nwould be revealed by moving a second bed\ninto his room.\nEagle-eyed warden, Dr Don Monroe, was\nquick to catch on. He swooped (hawk-like)\nand removed the offending item while the\nculprits were away.\nIntending to have a firm word with the\nchap pie( and presumably to reprimand him)\nDr Monroe re-visited the room later and\nrapped smartly on the door. He was admitted\nfollowing a series of suspicious noises from\ninside and was aghast to see a guest. Two\npillows lay adjacent on the floor.\nOn asking to inspect the wardrobe, Dr\nMonroe was hastily drawn into a discussion\nby the occupant involving at least four different\nexcuses. He feigned interest, but in an instant\ndeftly flicked open the wardrobe door. Imagine\nhis surprise when a third Chinaman fell onto\nthe floor!\nSubsequently the founder of the commune\nwas fined \u00a325 and coughed up without\nargument. Well done, Don! That's one in the\neye for Maoism!\nB of tcfa ma RMk\nThe FELIX Office has recently received a copy\nof Sphinx, the Liverpool Arts Magazine. Considering that Sphinx was a runner-up in\nthe NUS/ Guardian best magazine awards, it is\na pity that the issue we received contains such\na glaring boo-boo.\nOn the back is a Barciaybank Cash Around The Clock advert. At the end it says: \"You'll\nfind your nearest Barciaybank machine at 30\nMarket Hill or35 Sidney Street, Cambridge\".\nSome of us sitting around in the FELIX Office\nhad an amusing thought the other day. Heard\nof Trevor Phillips? Big. Trev was sabbatical\nICU President in 1974/5. Then he was\nsabbatical UL U President, then he was\nsabbatical president of the London Students'\nOrganisation (LSO). After that, he was a sabbatical member of the NUS Exec later to\nbecome sabbatical NUS President.\nSomeone had the bright idea that he might\nactually have a year of his chemistry degree\nstill to complete.\nTHIS Dennis Afolabi chap pie seems to be\nacting like a man who is going to die of an\nincurable disease within a couple of months\nand wants to go out with a bang. He is going\nout of his way to be as objectionable as\npossible to as many people as he can in a very short space of time. Not only is he\ngetting up Steve Marshall's nose, he's getting\nup the Haldane Librarian's as well.\nRichard Williams (the Librarian) has\nrecieved a letter from Mr Afolabi on behalf of\nthe /.''ro-Carib Soc demanding that the\nlibrary stock the following journals: Africa\n(60p monthly), West Africa (30p weekly),\nRoot (75p monthly), and West Indian World\n(30p weekly). The thought behind this is that\nas th j Chinese, Turkish, Greek, Arabic, and\nSwedish readers have journals in the library,\nso should Afro-Carib Soc.\nMr Williams wrote back informing Mr\nAfolabi that these Societies bought the\njournals themselves and the library very\nkindly gave them shelf space; he offered shelf\nspace to Mr Afolabi for his journals. This was\nnot good enough for Danny though, who\nwrote back asking Mr Williams to justify the\nHaldane's subscriptions to Punch and Gay\nNews in preference to, for example, Root.\nTo quote his letter:\"...we would be most\nobliged if you could kindly let us know the\nreason for taking Gay Neujs but not West\nIndian World, and Punch but not Root.\"\nIs this jerk for real?\nStop Press\nI have just heard that Diogenes has taken his\ncause to the Internal Services Committee.\nHe is demanding that out of the \u00a3120\nallocated to the Haldane for subscriptions,\n\u00a347.40 should be devoted to his Afro-Carib\njournals.\nPunch readers unite to stamp out this\nverminous filth!\nHoM feat Jc fee Scourge of the Nat West Bank, John\nWhitehouse, has been complaining to the\nbank's student lias on officer, Tom Cottrell.\nJohn's been wing eing about waiting two weeks\nfor his service till card. Tom didn't have the\nheart to tell him he's been waiting three weeks\nfor his.\nS fes Scuidwick\nMr Mooney, Dietician-In-Chief (DIC for short)\nhits the headlines again. Victor Mooney first\nfound fame with our \"Mouldy Chickens\" story,\nthen the rotten food in Southside due to the\ncook-freeze abuse.\nRecently, a young lady was surprised to find\na slug wriggling about inside a sandwich she\nhad just purchased from the Union Lower\nRefectory. The person at the till tried to calm\nher down: \"Don't make a fuss, love, just take\nanother one\". Reticent at the thought of\nfinding half a slug in her next choice, she\nrefused and left in disgust.\nAfter she had gone, the person at the cash\ndesk deftly removed the slug, rearranged the\ntomatoes and lettuce and subtly, replaced the\noffending sandwich. Just think, YOU may\nhave eaten that s arnie, nice thought, huh! I don't want to cast aspersions, but just how\nmany of Mooney's sandwich makers roll\nbogies mid sandwich or don't wash their hands\nafter going to the toilet?\nIn my time at College I 've found one hairpin,\nfive hairs (and dandruff), 27 assorted pieces of\nplastic, one cockroach leg, three pairs of false\nteeth, a nail file, two big toe nails, one false\neyeball, an Irish 5p,a3a mp fuse, a ball point\npen refill, a cabbage white pupa, a false\neyelash, a contact lens, a golf tee, and a small\npiece of paper with the word BOAZ written on\nit. Is this a record?\nPage 10 FELIX, November 7, 1980\n\n"

Yet, as far as Shell is concerned,\nnothing could be further from the truth.\nYou will find the wide range of work of many\nMechanical Engineers described in our booklet\n'Opportunities for Graduates, 1981', and this should\ncome as no surprise if you think about the technical\nscope of our activities. Spread more widely across the\nworld of Shell than probably any other group of\nprofessionals, we have a good few hundred Mechanical\nEngineers with virtually unlimited scope to move into\nany sphere, and there are scarcely any activities\nequivalent to the 'shop floor'.\nEarly management involvement\nRight from your early months you will be involved in\nthe management of engineering projects, for with Shell\nyou are emphatically not someone who just solves\nproblems on paper. Planning and co-ordinating\nprogrammes and negotiating with contractors will all\nbe part of your task, working in small teams.\nWe shall expect you to do your problem-solving in a context of great autonomy, while you are quite likely to\nfind yourself having to work out your own technology.\nAnd you are certain to meet human problems as well as\nmechanical ones.\nMost people seem to like it that way.\nOpportunities to acquire new skills\nWhatever your engineering interest at University,\nShell can offer an enormous variety of possibilities,\nparticularly as we diversify our worldwide business.\nThe training and scope for career development,\nincluding senior management opportunities, match the\nwealth of experience we provide so that with Shell you\ncan be qualified for any field. And you will be\nencouraged to acquire Chartered Engineer status in\nyour early years, doing professional work that satisfies\nthe Institution's requirements. We believe in growing\nbur own leaders and in making the fullest use of the best\nbrains around.\nIf you're among the best of Undergraduates, and\nparticularly if you're in your final year, you could well\nfind it worthwhile considering Shell at least to the point\nof looking at our 1981 booklet now at your Careers\nService.

It would appear that the entire occasion was a great success from almost everyone's point of view \u2014 the Duke's and the delegates' arrival at and departure from College being so\nwell organised as to be almost unnoticed by the majority of students. Indeed, when FELIX asked Captain Lindley how many visitors had been here, he said:\" I don't know, I don't stand and count' em, and it's not up tome to count them either\". When pressed further on the point, he said,\" Oh God, I don't know\". FELIX would like to apologise to Captain Lindley for thinking that he should know.

Judge by the event, Fox and\nO' Boyle.

In the\ndiscussion that followed (over the\nphone and in the Union Office\nless than five minutes later), I did\nNOT say, or give the impression,\nthat Mary Attenborough had\nbacked out' of anything. There was a witness present. I therefore\nchallenge you to substantiate your aspersion that the contrary\nis true.\nMary herself sav s she did not\n'back out'. You have alleged in\nprint'that she did. Therefore, the\nonus is on you to produce any\nconcrete evidence you may have\nto support your position. By publishing the damaging statement in your Editorial, you have\nerred on points of fact and of law.\nAnd if you have any knowledge\nof ICU constitutional documents\nat all, you would accept that the\nFELIX Editor is responsible for\nfacts in his Editorial, irrespective\nof the initial source of his alleged\nmisinformation. It is un believable that an Editor should\nclaim he is not responsible for a statement he wrote and published!\nAny decent Editor, if he committed the blunder at all, would\nhave apologised to Mary by now.\nSince you have so far not\nproved yourself sufficiently conversant with the basic principles and practice of responsible\njournalism, one should not take\nseriously your latest attempt to\ndabble in matters of law.

On the\nlast day for accepting motions, Liz Lindsay received a call from you in\nwhich you said that although you\nhad not asked Mary Attenborough\n\" you felt sure she would agree to\nsecond the motion\". Liz tried to\nphone Mary, but was unable to\ncontact her. Just before the closing\ndeadline you rang back and withdrew Mary and suggested\nsomeone called Fernando.\nI resent your letter and all of\nyour other letters, and I don't like\nthe way you have treated Mary in\nthis matter; I think you owe her an\napology.\nI too have no time for trivialities\nand hence I have no wish to discuss\nthe matter (whatever it is!) any\nfurther.\nYO LJ elected me to Office and\nYOU have the power to remove\nme, why don't you exercise your\nrights?

It's written\nby David Watson, and the question is addressed\nto the supernatural realm, where many people\nmaintain that God exists. The book looks at\nwhether, with mankind and the world in its\npresent state, it is reasonable to take seriously the\nsuggestion that God does exist. It also examines\nthe ways that Christians claim that God has\ncommunicated with us, predominantly through\nJesus Christ. If God does exist, and is interested\nin people, this has important consequences for\nus, and the book looks at how we can relate to\nGod, and how He has made this possible, and\nwhat we should do about it.\nYou've probably guessed by now that the book\nin being distributed by IC Chrisian Union; we\nhave found in our own experience that what\nDavid Watson talks about is true, and we don't want to keep it to ourselves, so why not get hold\nof a copy?

    "content": "GO BACK HOME\nThis article is written to reveal some of the difficult situations\nthat overseas students, graduates in particular, are now\nfacing under the present system. Although my own experience is being referred to, some points like high tuition\nfees and the work permits are relevant to most overseas\nstudents.\nMark Wong outlines the difficulties faced by\noverseas IC graduates when applying for a job\nin this country.\nI came to Britain four years\nago from HongKong( a British\ncolony). As I was born in HongKong I have a British passport\n^i.e. British nationality) but I am a British subject, not a British\nc it rj n: therefore Iam classified\nas an overseas student. I came\nto Imperial College to do chemical engineering alter I finished myA levels in one year. I have learnt a lot, not 1\nonly academically, these four years. I like this country and I have made a lot of friends. I feel\naccepted by most of the people\nI have met, so I think I could\nsett'\" in this country. In my final year, I decided to settle\ndown here and make a career in\nchemical engineering. It is not\nonly because there are more opportunities for a chemical engineer here than in HongKong, hut I can also contribute\nmore from both my education\nand cultural background.\nI joined the milk round and\nlooked for a suitable job. After\nsome consideration, I chose a list of nine companies, all of\nthem were oil companies, chem ical manufacturers or chemical\nengineering contractors. How ever, I encountered a problem\nin getting a job, and that is, I have to have a work permit in\norder to be employed. An employer who is interested in\nemploying an overseas worker\nlike myself can apply to the\nHome Office on behalf of the\noverseas worker for a work permit. However, the overseas\nworker has to at least satisfy a list of regulations laid down by\nthe Home Office. In the past, it\nwas difficult but still possible to\nget a work permit. In 1979, a new legislation came in meaning that the applicant overseas worker of the work permit must\nbe over the age of 23. This rule, to\nme, is put in just to stop most of\nthe overseas graduates getting a job here. There are other regulations like the employer has to advertise the job in Britain and other EEC countries\nand show that he has no suitable\ncandidate from this country or\nother. EEC country.\nI was warned many times that it was likely to be extremely\ndifficult to obtain a work permit. Despite this, I went to\nthe first round of interviews. A couple of companies didn't even\ngive me a first interview. One of\nthese companies stated clearly-in the letter that it was because\nthey would not be able to get\nme a work permit. I was turned\ndown by another two companies'\nafter first interviews probably\nalso because of the work permit\nproblem. Nevertheless, I received\nseven invitations from five companies (some of these companies have subsidiaries and divisions) so, the first round of\ninterviews 'was successful given\nmy problem. The second round\nof interviews was also reasonably\nsuccessful although the work permit issue was inevitably raised\nand discussed. This issue was\ncertainly taken into account by\nthe employer before they decided\nwhether to offer me a job or not.\nAt the end, I had three offers of\nemployment: one from an oil\ncompany and the other two from\nthe same but different parts of an\ninternational oil and chemical\ncompany. I then made up my mind to join the international oil\nand chemical giant. A good deal\nof effort was then put in by the\ncompany to prepare for the\napplication of my work permit. I remained in London after the\nthird year exams to wait for the\noutcome of the application. The bad news came in early july when\nthe Home Office turned down my\napplication. The company informed me of the result and that\nwe had the right to appeal against\nthe Home Office decision. A week\nlater, I got in touch with the\ncompany again and I was surprised and disappointed to\nhear that the company, after\na week of careful consideration\nwould not appeal on my behalf\nbecause the chance of success\nwas extremely slim. They could\ndo nothing but to withdraw the\noffer of employment.\nI just don't understand why I should not be allowed to take\nup the job here when I have\nhad four years of good education.\nThere are employers looking for\ngood graduates, there are employers who could not find suitable candidates for their vacancies and there are people\nlike myself being offered a job\nbut not allowed to take it. Even if there were no shortage of\nchemical engineers, some large\ncompanies can certainly absorb\nmore than they need and manpower is one of the most important assets of a company.\nThe fact that I was offered a job did not mean that a British citizen was thrown out of work\nor prevented from taking up a job.\nDespaired with the Home Office decision, I came back to\nCollege and tried to obtain a scholarship or sponsorship to do\na further degree; by this time,\nmy degree was known \u2014 a very\ngood second upper.\nIran into difficulty again because Iam not eligible for aS RC grant and my fa mily cannot afford my fees and living\nexpenses (Tuition fees for overseas students at Imperial College\nare \u00a33,000pa for session 198071,\na minimum sum of \u00a32,700pa as\nliving expenses is recommended\nby the London Conference on\nOverseas Students in consultation\nwith the British Council.) It\nwould be difficult to ask an industrial sponsor to pay \u00a3 5 , 7 0 0\na year to support a student for a further degree, as he might as\nwell employ the student and give him \u00a35,500pa salary. I was\nfortunate enough to get a fees\nremission from the Overseas Student Fees Support Scheme.\nPractically for the1980/1 session I had only need to pay\n\u00a3 l,105p a, as the tuition fees as I limited myself to those projects\nand courses which have money\nattached to them. Iam grateful\nthat I could find something interesting and be sponsored to\ndo it.\nHowever, there are many sell-sponsored students, both post- \u2022\ngraduate and undergraduate, who cannot afford the high fees.\nIt means that many capable students who are interested in\ndoing research and being edu-cate d are losing their opportunities. From the College point\nof view, it may mean a substantial decrease in the intake of\noverseas students. Currently 46%\nof postgraduate students at\nImperial College came from overseas. Can the College afford\nlosing half of this 46% of overseas\nstudents?\nSmall Ads\n\u2022Cooker, 1 ring electric cooker with\ngrill. Perfect for preparing all your\nmeals. \u00a322 or best offer.
