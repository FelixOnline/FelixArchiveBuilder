    "content": "2\nFELIX PROFILE I.C. DEBATE R.H. KINGDON\nPRESIDENT OF\nR.S. M. UNION\nRobert H. King don was born in London. Unfortunately he arrive data noisy part of the day and did i't hear Bow. Bells. This was a disappoint ment so he returned to his family home in Cornwall. It was here, in this, oo un ty that cradled European. mining, that he developed an interest in mining engineering. Bob, as he is more generally known, has many\nof the characteristics of his native oo un ty. An agreeably strong personality, buttressed by principles. With these he is proving a competent\nChairman. It is interesting to uncover his past. He\nattended Bradfield College where asia usual in most Public School she endured the hardships of games, every afternoon. He eventually found this enjoyable and played Soccer for the( School l. During his last year he became distinguished, he was made a prefect. In these s teD s followed National Service. He was commissioned in R.E. M.E. and posted to foreign parts Honiton, Devon, during this exile he turned recruits into soldiers in the space of six. weeks.\nHis entry into the Mines was quiet. He still distinguishes himself as being a Miner whose best time for the Yard' is not less than25 sees. He\nhopes with practise to improve on this. As a Freshman he played football for the R.S. M. but later fulfilled a childhood desire to play with water when he joined the Boat Club. Last year he won our admiration by rowing in the Morphy or ew after only a month's experience and later stroking an eight which became known as the\" Flying Fifth\" renowned for its rao ing ability and high rate of striking. This summer he ventured abroad to mine and prospect xn Canada. He now talks loquacious ly of his experiences and hopes to return. A man of varied tastes i he enjoys Greek drama\nand music, has a special interest in Cornish Engines and a Traction Engine and hopes to. follow Orpheus.. A. man of few dislikes, foremost among the seo eing male secretaries, days after, honeymooners\naad 3. King don. BOM CLUB DINNER Even as night follows day men follow Monroe,\nso,on Morphy Day, does the Boat Club Dinner, follow the racing, On November 1 0 th, therefore, the mem-be rs and their guests gathered in the Upper Dining Hall to eat, drink and talk of rowing. This year it is pleasant to record that the actual food was con cider ably better than on certain previous ocoa s ions which added greatly to the enjoy ment of the evening. Throughout the proceedings the beer flowed freely, if not free, being brought up from the bar by a steady ferry service, which grew slightly less steady as the evening wore on. There was, however,\na \u2022 suspicion that certain members of the company\nhad been consuming beer, and even Merrydown,' before the dinner itself started. But, if the occasional table mat did curve gracefully through the air such phenomena have been observed on considerably more\nformal occasions... The speeches were good, though perhaps notable for the fact that they contained only three stones, one of which is repeatable in( almost) any company,\nand it is' probably some time since the Boat Club were last collectively referred to as \"my dears\". After the dinner the company retired by the conventional stages to the bar, the entrance hall, the tennis courts and the hostel, where the evening drew more or less peacefully to a close. Guest speakers were in vit f cfd from '^u een Mary\nCollege on Tuesday 1 6 th. Nov. to oppose the motion that:\" This house denies that the Actress said any-thing to the Bishop\". This debate was characterized by the usual apathy Trom the floor. Miss Osborne, who proposed the motion, frustrated the hopeful from the start by refusing to give any example of what the Actress is actually supposed to have said to the Bishop. She waa convinced that the whole affair was due to Punch in it she avi our humour ed days. Her contention that all actresses are nice girls at heart, and therefore can say nothing mm ch to anyone, out of place, was greeted with doubt from the f loir. Mr. McCormick, President of t ne U.L. Liberal Society, opposed the motion. He first expressed his delight at finding that we were not Westfield, as he had been led to believe; and then proceeded with his attack, its main object being to prove that as women are in the ascendancy, and the people on top may say what they please, there is every\nlike le hood that the Actress expressed herself vividly to the Bishop. The'1001 nights' was a striking example of the drift of woman's imagination. His personal op pinion \u2014 very well ree i ved by the house \u2014 that the moral standards of \"omen today are exceedingly low; one is not to approve or disapprove; one is merely to take advantage. Mr. Bernstein, following up Miss Osborne\nw tih quotations, attributed to the Actress, \"Have I come all the way for this?\"( Haystack in Floods). He also voiced the view that Newton's Laws of Motion were merely an incorrect translation of the Actress' s remarks.\nThe opposition then roared home on wheels\nably greased by Mr. Martin F foulke s,our second\nguest from Q.M. C. He was convinced that the Actress and the Bishop were \"on the right road\"; and he was sure that the house with its\" true liberal spirit\", would agree. \"No smoke with out fire, particularly smutty smoke J\" The one point on wh i oh his small section of the liberal party were agreed, was that intercourse between A and B was to be encouraged. He hoped\nto live to see the transference of Aunt Agony's column to the Parish Magazine, with eminent B is hops doling out advice based on person alex per ince. There being not much comment from the floor, a vote was taken, and the motion almost unanimously defeated..

The weather was cold and somewhat wet with a stiff southeast wind making the half ebb stream very rough indeed be tween Harrods and the Fulham Poo t ball Ground. Tne Morpny Oup was raced on smooth water with a strong fol lb wing wind from the Bandstand to Hammersmith Bridge.R. S.M. drew the Surrey station R.C.S. the centre station and C&G the Middlesex\nstation. Prom the start the rao e became a text book example of one cox imposing his will by j virtue of his experience and reputation on the other two cox es and gaining for his or ewan inestimable: advantage by keeping both the other crews in the sla ok water. Paul Harding went a very long way\ntowards winning the rao e for Guilds on his own.\nAll three crews got away well, Guilds striking34 strokes in the first minute to32 by R.C.S. and30 by Mines. Harding, determined not to be left wide on the outside of t ne bends atC his wi ok Steps and from the bottom of the Island to Hammersmith\nbridge at once o a me over to Surrey. Guilds took\nan early lead and with his bows in front their cox challenged. t.c. S. fort ne centre station. R.C.S. and Mines both gave way towards the Surrey shore and Harding was given a clear run through to take up a position ahead of' the other two crews and to the surrey side of the river. The R.C. S.o ox challenged too late, having let Guilds go a length aue ad before attempting to for oe them bao k to their proper s tui o.i. AS a result R.C. S.'weatier owing for long stretches in the Guilds wash and Mines were so near snore taut hey had lost the Surrey e stream altogether. however, not, w th standing this, the rowing of all three crew* as of a high standard and the R.C.S. and Mines rowed a very fine hard fought rao e side by side nearly all the way with Mines just getting home by a canvas. Guilds won by nearly two length sAith Mines second a canvas ahead of i i.C.S.3 y the. ime .he or ews had changed boats wi tn\nthe Lowry crews, both wind and tide had dropped and the Lowry Cup was rowed over he usual course from the MilePost to University Stone, Putney. Again the cox es made the race extremely exciting: o watch from he Umpire's launch. Guilds were again on the Middlesex station with R. C.S.ce n. re andR. S.M. Surrey. The o ox of the Guilds had a difficult job; Bow side were being\" carted\" and the boat tended to\ngo against. he rudder towards the Surrey shore, whilst at the same time the stream was running fast off the mud flats above the Poo t ball Ground and also helping to for oe Guilds towards the other two\ncrews. A3 a result, soon after the start, the Guilds ore w,ins pi it e of their cox' s efforts, began to go over to the other two boats. The R.C.S. cox stuck to his water and a clash seemed inevitable, but somehow the Guilds rudder managed to pass across the bows of the R.C.S. boat with less than a foot to spare. All three crews rowed well and the result was\nGuilds first by four lengths, with R.C.S. second\ntwo lengths ahead of Mines. SOCCER\nThe last three games played by the1 st XI show that the form of the team is somewhat variable I.C.1 WADHAM (OXFORD)-1\nST.MARY'S1 READING 2\nI.C.I. C. Against Wadham the I.C. team had more than\neighty percent, of the game but the shooting of the forwards was entirely ineffectual and Wadham\nescaped what should have been a heavy defeat. Ih the match against St. Mary's the I.C. XI played a similar roll to Wadnam in the previous match. St. Mary's a fitter and faster team\nshould have won quite comfortably but luck was\non the \u2022 side of I.C. and the winning goal was\nscored against the run of the play. Reading University who usually field a far stronger side than I.C. narrowly defeated us by\n2 goals to1 after a fast open game. Reading won because their forwards accepted the open-in gs. created, by their halfbacks. I. C.had plenty of chances, 'but allowed the fruits of their labour to be lost to the winds. The' old adage \" Its goals that count,\" should be hung up in the. dressing room a tH arlington before the next cup mato h with Westminster. CROSS COUNTRY CUUB.\nI. Oi V. KING'SV. LINCOLN COLLEGE, OXFORD.\nIn this triangular nat ch held over tra a I.C.5i \u2022 ilea course in Richmond Park, King's were winners\nwith90 point stoI.C' a37 and Lincoln's60. This i a a considerably better result than the last fl x ture with King's produced, even though I.C. were\nthen without Evans.\nConditions were almost perfect for running, although the course was rather wet( and most members\nof the I.C. team recorded their fastest time s.T. Bailey of I.C. parted company with the rest of the field after the first mile and won with a time of27 min45 secs,, equalling the course record already held jointly by himself and D.J. Pain. King's then\npacked in their three University runners who were\nfollowed by the first Lincoln man. Me ller rana very good race to take6 th pla oe, with Dearden\nand Oldfield backing up well in8 th and 9 th places. SQUASH.\nIn the first round of the U.L. Cup competition Imperial College narrowly defeated the Wye College by 2 matches to1. Hart and Bra it ri waite were I.C.' opening players and both lost their first games.\nPlaying before a group of excited spectators they fought bacK and bot n levelled their games to22. Bra i thwaite then went on to win his match, although Hart lost his, leaving the game still in the balance. Mao Bean secured the mato h for I.C. by winning\nhis game 3-0.\nI.C. WSC \u2014\n4 4 * The-women's hockey team ha a now Just if led its existence by beating Royal Holloway 2nd XI\nby 6 goals to1, two of the a e being hard circle shots by Mies Wendy Pipe, a welcome addition to tha\nteam.

In spite of the hi gner grading of many of the\npolice team the match was drawn, one policeman retiring hurt.' All retired later to the bar where mutual sympathy and consolation was expressed over the lack of the normal Nov. 5 th activities. CONING EVENTS.

    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nThe Editor, Felix. City and Guilds College, London, S.W.7. Dear Sir, Ur. A. Kitchener, this page, Friday12 th November, deplores that he and other members of the various athletic clubs should contribute some effort to the Guy Fawkes night celebrations a tH arlington. It waa with great sorrow that I read this letter. Perhaps he has no recollection of one certain even in gat the beginning ef term when he and a colleague, after the bar had refused to support them any\nlonger, toured the notice boards proposing each\nether for office in half the social clubs in the\nUnion. It is very sad that this fine example of pure altruism, this earnest desire to serve his fellow men in the Union, has been so short lived. Yours faithfully, D.V. Finch. The Editor, FELIX. New Hostel, Bear Sir, True to the first principle ef Journal la a \"Don't get it right, get it written\" you\nhave, in the last issue1 ef FELIX, got several things written. First of all, what is the \u00bbunofficial\nR.C.S. firing squad\"? We were members of the group\nbelow the balloons firing upwards - and we sear no\nothers there. Than again, some ef eur colleagues\nshot dawn one balloon with their first sighting shot ( a meat praiseworthy effort) from oat on the Rugger pitch; in addition to cutting freese me more\nballoons later., All this i a by the way. One thing we did notice, was that i a all the praise for the organisation ef the R erling ton \"Do\", no one has mentioned the hopelessly Inadequate, inefficient and in u tile bar facilities. We, Sir, object to Joining a six-deep crowd between rounds. The beer was go ed, but\nwe couldn't enjoy it when quiet, steady drinking time times were punctuated with a scrum reminiscent of Pic cn dilly at closing time. In addition, the bar men were definately not up to the strain of continuous serving, and this was aggravated by the length Of bar available. May we, Sir, put it on record that we think that at future \"Do's\" of a similar nature, great care and attention should be paid by\nthe responsible committee to these facilities. Youra etc. U.

The Editor, FELIX.\nDear Sir, t fe read in the last number of FELIX a fitting profile of Andy La vine, our beloved President, but alas, a lack, when we came to the last line we\nfound the vital ending was missing! Pray, Sir,I beg you to in form me whether\nyou intend to issue the remainder of the s again serial form, 01 perhaps you intend to hold a compet;Ition to find a suitable ending? I, and doubtless many hundreds of other Guilds a en are awaiting this Chance of proving to the world that Andy is a man,\nand a fitting President for Guilds. Yours faithfully,' Bogen arian' Ed:We apollo gi seto Ur. Levine for having lost the\nlast word of his profile.

Seven minutes late already at Westminster; hardly surprising, for the traffic is very heavy.

The Guilds carriage left South Kens- in gt on furnished with a weighing machine for the amusement of its occupants. Acquired from South Ken. station, this machine was Jettisoned a tSar is Court when the remarks of a zealous porter caused\na little disturbance. However, as some o on pens ation for the loss, the aforesaid servant of London\nTransport donated his cap which was passed on to the lost property department at Parsons Green. An\nassurance that the train would stop at Putney was\nobtained in the usual manner. The Putney Bridge station master, not quite entering into the spirit of the thing, conducted the nearest participant to a small waiting room in an ungentlemanly fashion for the purposes of an interview. The Oui lds man, one Mr.Brown, did not feel like discussing Mechani cal Engineering from a railway aspect, and left in haste with the station master inside the room\nand t1r to or locked on the outside. The w.ow d outside the Boat house, incidentally almost devoid of R.C.S. men, resembled a grumbling appendix in the belly of the embankment until the Morphy crews took to the water and appropriate cheering from both camps took to the air. Then the THE HAPPY WATCHERS ON THE TOWPATH\nfun started I A small body of Itinera conducted, in funeral procession, a full size replica of the Guilds spanner to the waters edge where, with appr opr i ate disrespect, the obj eot was snapped in two and the pieces thrown to the Thanes. At this the Guilds arose and, outnumbered by more than three to one, the Miners formed a thing old line across the road to face the Guilds charge. The\nresulting battle raged fast and furious; some of the contestants took an Involuntary bath, and\noutstanding was the notorious miner,B11H ds-n, with his flaming red hirsute growth, who dl st ingui shed( and nearly extinguished) himself. Towards the close of the engagement when many\nMiners had decided to retire, as c rummage of Guilds men were left fighting each other l Armistice proceedings were conducted in a friendly spirit, and both sides sang compliments to each other in pleasant fashion. That was the finale to the major ragging of th a day. The Presidents warned their flocks that the constabulary disapproved of abnormal travel by\ntube and threatened to take action in the event of a rowdy return Journey. The spectators were\nlate in realising the change of the Uorphy course but the gradually worsening weather did not damp--en their further enthusiasm.\" T~ december4* ticket(?)21 "

VIEWPOINT OVERSEAS STUDENTS Every year nearly two hundred overseas students\ncome from all parts of the world to take up courses of study in this college. Almost twenty per cent\nof. our students are not normally resident in Great\nBritain. Such figures may surprise many a. id\nshould demand our attention as to what is being \u2022 done to make our friends from overseas welcome.\nWhat conclusions must they inevitably come to as\nthey meet the cold reserve of the average English man, t ne businesslike and often unfriendly attitude of many London landladies coupled with changes in climate, custom, language, surroundings and so\non? What impressionist he student body a tI.C. giving to them? -vh at are they going to' say aboutus on their return home? Su cn questions are imp-or tant and it is about time we shook of four comp lace n cy and male real efforts too e friend and\nhelp them.\nAll too often the sum total of the overseas. students knowledge of England and our way of life revolves around a laboratory In which to v.or k and\na small room in which to rest. Wno is to blu\u00abe. for.such isolation? Ve are. Our attitude is not one of unkindness so much as\ndisinterest and the Union is the worse for it. The large majority of overseas students are postgraduates and many of them have taken an active part in the social life of the colleges from which-they come. 'He have seen the. capabilities of one\nor -Vwo who nave succeeded xnor eai cx ng. down t ne barriers and have obtained high position's of responsibility in our student life. are there not\nmore potential college presidents and council officials a nio ag overseas students? Last term a committee was set up to try and\nhelp the overseas student to settle down quickly into the English student way of life. An attempt \u2022was made to provide temporary ac como dati on with some patents of I.C. students who live in or around London. As a result seventeen. overseas students were helped in this way although many more had to\nbe refused be o a use of the lack of response. It' is appreciated that not everyone is in a position. to help in this very practical way and thanks are\ndue to the people who did offer. Another part of the committee's work is to',\norganise trips to Oxford and Cambridge. Recently\ntwo bus loads of students were shown around the\nmany places of interest in Cambridge by members\nof. the Christian Union there.\nSomething is being done but real friendship's cannot be offered by a committee ao ting on behalf\nof the students but by each student himself\nattempting to befriend and help our colleagues. from abroad; so that their stay here may not ,\nonly be profitable from the academic viewpoint '\n\u2022\n\u2022\n.but also from t ne much more important one of\nincreased friendly relations between the nations.\nJ.
