    "content": "20 Febrauary 1998\nIS IT ART OR SCIENCE I ARTS\nIMAGES FROM NATURE\nAn Exhibition from the archives of the Natural History Museum\n23\nI ts object is to induce the young\nto betake themselves...to the\nfields and woods, the mountains and shores there to examine\nfor themselves the rich profusion of\nnature and instead of vaguely\nadmiring the diversified scenery of\na district, to be able to mark its\nminutest features\" William MacGillivray\nThe Natural History museum may not be the most obvious origin\nfor art exhibitions. This fascinating\ncollection, however, proves that\nthe divide between art and science\ncan be easily bridged. Although\nmany of the pieces in this presentation are of great scientific value,\ntheir aesthetic qualities cannot be\noverlooked. The exhibition features\nover 70 works by a variety of artists\nwith a combination of drawings,\nwatercolours and prints originating\nfrom around the globe. The muse-um has amassed the third largest\ncollection of Natural History Art\nthrough donations, bequeath als and purchases of collections; this\ndisplay features a fragment from\nthis treasury.\nArtworks from the 18th and\n19th century expeditions and voyages are particularly well represent-ed, but the exhibition extends to\ncontemporary pieces. This provides a number of interesting comparisons and leads to an amazing\ndiversity of colour and style. A single theme which links all the work\nin this exhibition is attention to\ndetail. Some of the older specimen\ndrawings have been preserved\nfrom an expedition after the true\nspecimens have been destroyed or\nlost. The intricate brush strokes\nallow the viewer to experience\nalmost photographic accuracy. This\nhas been achieved by the persistence of artists such as Brian\nHargreaves who would spend two\ndays on a single butterfly study.\nArthur Harry Church has painted flower studies with a sharp\nvi bran ce that couldn't ever be associated with textbook pictures.\nUsing Chinese white paint to produce texture and form he would\npainstakingly shave away at the dry\nsurface to realise definition; even a white water lily on a pale sheet of\npaper gains an added dimension\nfrom this technique. At the same\ntime, each flower is scientifically\naccurate with a precise magnification for every piece.\nIn another field, the pebble\ndrawings of John Fullwood take on\nan extra-terrestrial feel as the mysterious contours collide in an array\nof colour.\nEach painting shows an appreciation and respect of the subject,\nand the excitement of discovery is\ntransmitted through the artwork to\nthe viewer. Olivia Fanny Tonge\nincludes a commentary in her\nsketchbooks with descriptions of\nthe taste of the fruit she is drawing.\nHenry Walter Bates introduced the\nconcept of insect mimicry after a series of studies that are considered to be further inspiration for\nDarwin's theory of natural se lec tion.\nThe association of these pieces\nwith scientific research is continual.\nAmadeo Terzi was part of a Malarial transmission theory test in\n1900. His paintings of a horse-fly\nand a mosquito are symmetrical\nand precise, each hair finely bristles\nout from the page with an aspect\nthat would seem hard to achieve\nwith watercolour.\nSome of the paintings have\nbeen enhanced over time producing stunning developments. A print\nof Sydney Parkinson's original\nwatercolour of an Indian tulip tree\nrevealed heightened detail of the\nvein network, and then Daniel\nMacKenzie transformed this into an\nelaborate engraving on copper in a final embellishment.\nHaving been brought up as a Quaker, William Bartram avoids the\nextravagance of many colours and\nuses a simple scheme. However,\nhis eccentricity lies elsewhere, in\nparticular with his use of scale.\nLooking at one piece, which at a first glance appears to be towering\nwater plants, discloses in one tiny\ncorner the first ever recorded drawing of a Venus flytrap.\nThe subjects in this exhibition,\nwhich have inspired so many artists\nin the past, ate at last given the\nchance to display their full\nglory...and it's free!\nDemelza\nMore information on diary pages\nFRANCIS BACON: THE HUMAN BODY\nHayward Gallery, South Bank\nOften considered the greatest British painter of the\ntwentieth century, Francis\nBacon has amassed a formidable\nreputation throughout his career,\ncoupled with international recognition somewhat amplified by the\nartist's death in 1992. The current\nsubstantial exhibition, devoted exclusively to full-length portraits\nand studies of the human figure,\ntherefore bears the momentous responsibility and challenge of living up to the public's tremendous\nexpectations - a task successfully\naccomplished judging by the unanimous acclaim bestowed by the\nreviews.\nDisplayed within spacious yet\nneutral surroundings, the dimensional appreciation enhances the\nstriking intensity of the canvases. A severe self-critic, Bacon destroyed\nthe bulk of his early work rendering\nhis artistic origins and initial influences highly enigmatic. Although\nthe comparative evolution of his\nvibrant personal style is impossible\nto establish, the brutal distortion of\naccentuated features remains a consistent trait. Indeed, his innovative existential approach renounces\nthe necessity of imagery, opting\ninstead for the figurative emphasis\non materials and texture. The\nastonishing depth captured by his\ncentral poses marks the pronounced transition towards a sculptural interpretation of the\npieces, the uniform backgrounds\nappearing to complete the work as\na mere afterthought. The exploration of colour is geared towards\nthe expression of movement, either\nthrough the sharp, passionate contrast between complimentary shades or the subtle, spectral gri-sail le tones.\nBacon represents a pioneer of\nmodern art; the sentiment of independence and isolation is reflected\nby the distinct alienation of the\ndepicted figures. Enclosed in cage-like structures, segregated by pleated curtains and screens, trapped in\ncorners or even elevated on plat-forms, the relative positions of the\nmodel and the environment reveal\nprofound confinement, the characteristic open mouthed poses of the\nhaunting figures also suggesting\nextreme anxiety and suffering. A bleak fantasy, Bacon's emotionally\ncharged work demands profound\nreflection as well as satisfying the\nmysterious visual curiosity of the\nobserver.\nHelena Cocheme\nMore information on diary pages\n\n"

    "content": "ELECTION INTERVIEWS\nSabbatical\n^ '(It r views<^ Interviews by Mark Baker\nFelix Editor\nAlok Jha\nEd Sexton\nPicking up on point from your manifestos - Alok, you've said repeatedly\nthat you want to make Felix into a mag-a zine. How will this be different when\nyou read it on Friday morning?\nAJ: The way a magazine is laid out is\nperhaps different from a newspaper. The\nway 1 want to make it a magazine is to\ngive it a front cover, simple, possibly a full\ncolour front cover depending on how\nmuch we can get in terms of money, etc.\nand I also want to make it look really\ngood so that people will be happy to pick\nit up, would like picking it up. But of\ncourse style isn't the only thing as far as\nFelix is concerned. I want to make it\nmuch more diverse in its layout and stuff\nwhich a newspaper I don't think allows.\nES: My experience of IC students is\nthat they pick up Felix on a Friday morning regardless of how glossy, how much\ncolour or how it looks. They pick it up\nregardless, and what keeps them reading\nis a simple, consistent layout more than\nanything, so that the articles are there,\nthey can see what they're about and they\ncan read them. I think it's very important\nthat Felix has a very simple layout and\nkeeps its newspaper format, because the\nmost important thing is news and sports,\nwhich are best presented in newspaper\nstyle.\nEd, bearing in mind that we are in\na science and technology college with\nno humanity at all, how do you plan to\nimprove the quality of writing in Felix?\nES: It's not a case of getting the people in the office at the moment and saying \"write better\". I think it's a simple\ncase of having more articles, because\nthen you can choose which ones are better and which ones maybe aren't so\ngood. The more people we get involved\nwith Felix, the more choice you've got\nand the better quality it can be.\nWe all know that the Felix editor\ndoesn't write it all himself, there's a large amount of organisation and also\na large amount of administration,\nespecially in the running of the finance.\nHow can we trust you to run the news-paper?\nA): I must admit that I really don't have much experience in the finance side\nof Felix, so I hope to learn over the next\nfew months, or the hand-over section.\nBut I feel I am a trustworthy person, I have the best interests of Felix at heart,\nand the Union for that matter.\nES: I'm going to come straight out\nnow and admit, when it comes to\nfinances, I'm really s pod dy in that I keep\na strict record of all my personal finances,\nand probably know better than Barclays\nwhat my bank balance is, so I can't really see the finances issue being a problem.\nI'm quite careful when it comes to\nmoney.\nBriefly, is advertising a good or a bad thing?\nA): Advertising, as far as I'm con-cern ed, is a good thing. It provides us\nwith more money to do more interesting\nthings with the Felix next year. I dispute\nthe fact that advertising makes Felix a worse newspaper, because as far as I'm concerned, if we get more advertising we\ncan produce more colour, more interesting layout and design. This is not to say\nthat advertising produces better articles\nbecause that comes from more people\ncontributing to us, but the fact is that\nadvertising brings in more money and\nbrings a better quality looking Felix to us\n- style as well as content is important.\nES: I see advertising as a necessary\nevil. We have to have advertising because\nthe Union can't provide all the money\nthat's needed to produce Felix on a yearly basis. However, I'd like to keep the\nadvertising to a minimum because, at the\nend of the day, the IC student on a Friday\nmorning would rather pick up a newspaper with the minimum amount of advertising but full of content than pick up a paper that's glossy but that's got lots of\nads in it.\nIf companies want to give us lots of\nmoney to advertise, I'm welcome to take\nit, but I want to keep the amount of\nadvertising in the newspaper to an\nabsolute minimum.\nCan you both name three of your\nfavourite magazines or newspapers\nthat you think will influence you in the\nJob?\nES: This is a tough one. Private Eye,\ndefinitely. Viz, maybe. And the Daily\nTelegraph, because its crosswords are\ngreat - not that I agree with its political\nstance.\nA]: Well, it's well documented that I want to make Felix into a magazine, so\nI'd like to mention three magazines,\nmaybe. The first on is The Edge, because\nI think it has the best styling in the world\nand I like to take a lot of influence from\nthat. The content from magazines like\nNew Scientist, which has a really great\nnews section as well as having a front\ncover which is maybe dedicated to its\nfeatures but has a really interesting and\ndiverse news section as well as everything else. And also the student magazines like the Graduate, which is a magazine aimed at students which has\nrecently come out. Its articles are aimed\nat students, who have recently graduated admittedly. They're interesting and\nrelevant to students.\nPresident\nDave Hellard\nJon Lambert\nWhy we should vote for you?\nDH: For years now, the position of\npresident has purely been something to\nboost people's egos, CV and power and\nI want to change this. I'm coming from an\noutside position actually want to make\nthe change, unlike previous candidates\nwho have stood purely for their own ben-ef it. As we've seen from C&.G, candidates\nwho stand just for themselves rather than\nwanting to do the job and really wanting\nto go through with it, there's problems.\nSo that's why you should vote for me.\nJL: Throughout my time here, I 've\ntaken part in all aspects of the union, I 've\nbeen involved in clubs, used the bar and\ncatering extensively and been employed\nby the union as well, both as a minibus\nsteward and to work in the resource c en tre. I'm on council at the moment, and\nIVe seen how to do the job, how people\nhave done it well and badly, and I think I can do a good job and I 've got a lot to\ncontribute.\nDave, obviously you're perceived as\nthe non hack' candidate. Now, what\nhave you actually done in Imperial\nCollege Union, and how do you think\nyou can compensate for your lack of\nexperience?\nDH: I 've spent a lot of time in the\nunion. I feel I can compensate for this\nlack of experience of college politics by\nthe fact that I 've got a vast experience of\ngeneral politics, including Politics A level,\nWorld United Nations discussing world\nevents in Holland, Dublin with over three\nand a half thousand students, discussions\nwith such people as John Prescott, Sir\nEdward Heath and Bruce Kemp, who's the CND founder.\nOK, Jon, in your manifesto, you\nmentioned the dep rep system, and\nhow it might be failing. What would you\ndo to change and improve it?\nJL: I think you'd have to start again\nwith fairly basic steps, just to make the\npeople who stand for the posts aware of\nthe sort of thing they need to do. Simple\nthings such as putting a job description\nnext to the papers when they're put up\nwould be a good start and from there we\ncan only build.\nMoving onto the wider political\narena, obviously tuition fees are likely\nto be introduced soon. What will you\ndo to prevent them adversely affecting\nstudents?\n20 February 1998\nDon't forget that if you don't like any of\nthe candidates for a post you can always\nvote New Election - if 'he' wins there\nwill be another election in which different candidates may stand.\nDH: Well, obviously everyone who\nstands is going to be for, er against,\ntuition fees, and it's a terrible they've\ndone, the Labour Government, not that I want to talk about them, but as a President the main things I can is to try\nto do is to work in conjunction with the\nCFE, although they're seen as radical,\nthey're what we've got, and also to a lesser extent the NUS, and just try and tell\npeople in Imperial to go to marches, and\nfor example to attend the walkout on 4\nMarch.\n|L: Well, I'm obviously against tuition\nfees as I'm sure most students are. I attended the march last term, where my\nvoice may not have been heard, but it\ncertainly joined the masses. I think that\nthe CFE should be encouraged in their\naims, but not the way they're achieving\nthem. I think realistically the group with\nthe biggest chance must be the Aldwych\ngroup, made up of the biggest and most\nrespected student unions in the country\nand I think they're the sort of people that\nmight be listened to.\nWhat do you see as being more\nimportant as Union President: campaigning on national political issues or\nlooking at the day to day running of ICU?\nJL: I think certainly the day to day\nrunning of the union, that's what affects\npeople that elect me, if they were to elect\nme, and I think that you can achieve a lot\nmore for Imperial College than you can\nfor the country or the world.\nDH: It's quite similar to the case of\nBill Clinton, where he spends most of his\ntime in Israel and Palestine and trying to\ncampaign for world peace, when at\nhome his domestic affairs are in a terrible state. I think that the time is obviously spent majorly on Imperial College,\nwhich is what people want generally\nbecause the influence we have to change\ndomestic affairs is, even though quite\nstrong, is limited compared to the\nchanges we can make to Imperial.\nAnd lastly, a slightly fatuous ques-tion. Do you think that fatness and\nchunky knit blue jumpers are vital qualities for a Union President?\nJL: I don't think it necessarily has to\nbe a blue chunky knit jumper, I think any\ndark colour will do.\nDH: The waistline is a very big thing,\ngeneral chunkiness is probably alright, but\nthe waistline is the most important part.\nFind the full transcript on the Felix webpages at www. su.ic.a c.uk/ Felix/ "

    "content": "NEWS 20 February 1998\nKing's Court for London Student\nANDY OFORI\nAn enraged King's College Union\nare on the warpath over a front\npage article in last weeks ' London Student' paper. The controversial\narticle, written by editor John\nHandelaar, informed of the Union's \"unplanned loss which might be as\nhigh as \u00a3 2 0 , 0 0 0 \" , relating it to the\nhighly sensitive suspension of the\nKing's Union Manager, James\nChirgwin, who has apparently been\ngranted sick leave since December\npending investigation (Felix 1 102).\nThe item incited immediate libel claims from King's Union leading to threats of legal action. Facts\nand figures quoted were censured\nas \"unfounded\" by an Union representative in the aftermath of the\narticle's release, and it was further\nclaimed the piece would \"affect\ndisciplinary proceedings\" surrounding the General Manager's case.\nFelix were the first to inform\nJohn Handelaar of the legal hostility he could. The self-assured edi-tor, although surprised, was unruffled in his response, commenting in\nreference to his article, he was\n\"extremely careful to make sure it\nwas not libellous\". The article was\ncarefully constructed around\nleaked information from the King's Union and Handelaar defended his\nsources as people who \"would\nknow one way or the other\".\nThe article signifies the first\nmajor outburst in an atmosphere of\nescalating tension over the issue;\nvarious interested parties, including\nFelix, have been compelled to fall\ninto line with King's 'self imposed\ngagging order' until a conclusion\nthey view as satisfactory has been\nreached. John Handelaar spoke of\nthe numerous phone calls he had\nregularly received on the matter\nsince news of the suspension circulated seven weeks ago, stating\n\"Something involving large a amount of student's money is very\nwrong and students down at King's have a right to know\", he went on\nto describe the Union's actions as\n\"fundamentally an attempt to\nsmoke out what really is\". London\nStudent is owned by UL U, leaving a query over King's seemingly paradoxical intention to sue a body of\nwhich they are an integral part. The\nLondon Student editor has adopted\nthe \"wait and see\" approach on the\nlegal front and was amenable to\ncompromise, explaining he was\nprepared to print corrections along\nwith an apology if King's could present proof contrary to his article\nMatt Davies, president of King's Union president viewed the article\nin Britain's largest student paper as\nan affront to the union, objecting to\nthe \"total factual inaccuracies of the\nwhole thing.\" In answer to the criticisms depicted in the article, Matt\nDavies counter claimed the issue\nhad been dealt with openly and\nestimates for any unaccountable\namounts were wildly exuberant.\nHe saw the piece as \"pretty much\ndeformation\" of the union and\nexplained the report has lead to\ntheir \"seeking top legal advice\".\nJohn Handelaar was officially\ninformed of King's Union intentions\nat last Tuesday'sULU council\nmeeting where he suffered a torrent of aggressive questioning as\nwell as threats of a ruinous legal\naction that could seriously jeo pardi seU LU's financial situation.\nLook at the Size of My Policies!\ncontinued from front page\nalready available at IC, and suggested that \"Positive steps should be\ntaken toward value for money\". Mr Wharton echoed these sentiments,\nadding that if the Union were in a position where d is affiliation would\nincrease their funding, then ICU\nshould quit UL U. Both James and\nDave pledged to keep the Med school bars open, with Mr Carter\npromising no price rises if ICU were\nto take over their running as \"It\nwould make no difference if the bars\nwere run from South Kensington\".\nThe third pairing of hopefuls\nwere those for Deputy President\n(Clubs &. Societies), Adam Cherrington and Simon Cooper. Questioned on the future of the\nC CU structure, Simon saw the\nConstituent Unions as \"Providing\natmosphere and spirit\" in the Union,\nwhilst Adam commented that there\nis huge potential for the CC Us giving 1C SM Students' Union as his\nexample. On the issue of BUSA,\nwhen asked whether single entry\nwould ever be viable Adam answered that \"It needs to be viable\nif the teams are to be competitive,\neven if they are all-medic sides\"\nadding that he would encourage the\nextension of the inter-CCU Sparks\nCup to cover the medical teams and\nthus aid interaction. Simon replied\nthat \"Two years on campus together will make them play together\".\nHowever, both candidates denied\nthat they would force mergers for\nnon-sporting clubs within ICSM,\nAdam feeling \" No need to force a join\", and Simon suggesting that all\nsocieties should be allowed \"Self-determination\" over their future.\nwho knows how the Union works,\nand could be taken seriously, whilst\nDave saw his lack of experience at\nICU as a positive trait, giving him an\ninsight into \"the feelings of average\nstudents\". When questioned, both\nClockwise from top-right: (on Lambert; Dave Hellard; Alok |ha; Ed Sexton; and Simon Cooper and Adam Cherrington go the full monty.\nPhotos: Mark Smith, David Roberts and Matt Kempton\nFinally, the two Presidential can-di dates, Jon Lambert and Dave\nHellard presented the strongest\ncontrast. Jon portrayed himself of\nthe voice of experience, someone\ncandidates advocated free e duca tion, with Dave supporting the work\nof the Campaign for Free Education\nand the proposed national student\nstrike. Ion however, felt that \"Sit-ins\ndon't achieve anything, and whilst\nagreeing with the aims of the CFE,\nhe did not advocate their methods.\nOn the subject of accommodation,\nDave proposed an \"ICU standard for\napproved landlords\". Jon saw the\nproblem as \"A fundamental lack of\nHall space\", and agreed that all first\nyears, across the College, need to\ncontinue to be housed in Halls.\nWednesday saw the candidates\nplaying to a packed bar at St Mary's, with medical issues being the hot\ntopic. Both Presidential candidates\ndenied there was no time scale on\nthe existence of the ICS MSU President as a sabbatical role, and\npromising to keep the medical bars\nopen. They also promised extra\nevents for the new medical students\nduring fresher s' week, to ensure the\nsense of unity between the medics\nwill continue.\nHowever, most other answers\nwere drowned out, and instead\nreplaced by a torrent of fl anning, pint-downing, singing and arse-waving. As a result, the most frequently asked question of the night\nrevolved around how far any of the\ncandidates would go to win the\nmystical 'medics block vote'.\nAnswers varied, with both of the DP\n(C8JS) candidates denying they\nwould sell their soul to Satan, but\nDave Hellard admitting that he\nwould willingly sleep with the 1C SM SU President to win the election.\n\n"

    "content": "20 February 1998 BOOKS\nFICTION\nTHE BEAUTY OF MEN\nAndrew Holleran\nT he Beauty of Men is a novel\ncatering to a niche audience.\nThe central character, \"Lark\",\nis a middle-aged homosexual, and\nthe book deals with his day-to-day\nlife and pondering. He is obsessed\nwith ageing and death, the two\nextremes of this scale examined by\nhis relationship with his paralysed\nmother and with the young man he\nfinds himself captivated with, having met him at another focus of the\nnovel, the boat ramp. The boat\nramp is superficially a place the gay\ncommunity silently agree on as a meeting place, but to the more\nastute reader it will be something\nmore. Many of his friends have\ndied of AIDS, and AIDS hangs as a grim spectre over many of his\nthoughts, as he ponders his own loneliness and the emptiness of his\nlife.\nOn occasion the courageous\nportrayal of homosexuality in the\nnovel is brutal, and a large number\nof homophobic students at IC will\nfind themselves unable to accept\nthe stark and unsubtle activities of\nthe homosexual community as\nHolleran shows them. However, if\nthe reader can approach this with\nan open mind they will find Andrew\nHolleran's writing style to be\nsmooth and flowing; his prose is\nprofessionally written and accordingly no effort has to be put into\nreading it, making the grains of wis-dom and comments on society\neasier to find and understand. The\nchapters are discrete sections of\nhis current life, and each is to a degree a self-contained entity,\nmaking the novel easier still to\nread.\nThis should not be seen as a portrayal of the gay community, as\nthe individuals of that group are as\ndiverse and varied as any other\ngroup; the homosexuality in the\nbook is not the focus, but rather a detail, of the novel's message.\nAlmost certainly though, what\nhomosexuals will get out of this\nnovel that will differ from what heterosexuals will; both will find new\nperspectives and views, and both\nwill finish having gained something.\nMany authors shy away from these\nissues, and it is refreshing to see an\nauthor deal with the undoubtedly\nangst-ridden life of such people in\nour not yet accepting society.\nHolleran has gained high praise\nfrom critics for his previous works,\nand this groundbreaking novel\ndeserves no less praise.\nRob ]. Cwinn\nPublisher: Picador\nPrice: \u00a3 6 . 9 9\nOut: Now Sally Beauman\nSextet is billed as a sexy thriller.\nIdeal Home says of it, \"A dark concoction of sexual obsession and\nromantic love... Compulsive read-ing.\"\nHowever, I found the story\ncontrived and an attempt to entangle two essentially unlinked plots\nweakens an otherwise enjoyable\nbook. The stereotypes littered\nthroughout are the most striking\nthing about the novel. It is a piece\nof light entertainment, to be read\nand disregarded. The readers who subscribe to \" Good Housekeeping\"\ncould use it to take their minds off\nthe pile of ironing that must be finished before their man returns\nhome from a hard day iit the\noffice. A harsh stereotype maybe,\nbut this portrayal of women is no\nworse than the ones we are presented with by Beauman herself.\nThe oversimplified characters\nemphasise these stereotypes fur-ther. We see the empty shell of\nwomen who are incomplete without the love of a good man, and\nmen driven by obsession. We have\na single parent whose life lacks\ndirection since her only son, her\nreason for living, flies the nest. His\ngirlfriend, a young, headstrong\nOxford student who falls for an\nolder man. There is a successful\nactress whose producer, ex-hus-band still has an unnatural and\ninexplicable hold over her life. An\nugly, overweight Sicilian virgin of\nfifty-five who believes her curses\nand prayers will rid their lives of\nthe tormented joe King, a stalker.\nThere is even an eccentric old aris-to crat, a spinster of course.\nThe male characters are even\nless developed than their female\ncounterparts. There are token\ngays, one of whom is psychic, and\nan English landowner who is still\ndeeply affected by the death of his\nbrother twenty-five years earlier.\nThe narrative moves you between different characters' perspectives too often to really understand the persona of any one per-son. Although an intriguing love\ntriangle provides a situation in\nwhich we seek an exciting climax, I was left unsatisfied.\nThis is a book to pick up after a hard day and read to numb the\nmind after excess usage. Reading\n\"Sextet\" is a good way to relax, but\nnot a good way to broaden your\nmind.\nXena\n\u00a3 5 . 9 9 from Bantam Books\nTHE NOTEBOOK\nNicholas Sparks \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nT he cover bills this book as a \"bittersweet and irresistibly\nromantic love story\", so I was a bit sceptical at first. It is,\nhowever, a lovely story\nabout Noah Calhoun, a native of North Carolina,\nand Allie Nelson, who meet one summer as\nteenagers when Allie's family comes to Carolina\non business. Allie's parents\ndisapprove of her relationship with Noah, as they\ncome from a moneyed background where every\nacquaintance must be of\nequal social status, so it is\nno sup rise when they prevent further' contact\nbetween the couple at the\nsummer's end.\nEven though both carry\non with their lives, neither\nforgets the other, especially Noah who prefers to live\nwith his memories of Allie\nrather than commit himself\nto another woman. They\nnext meet 14 years later\nwhen Allie discovers his photograph in a newspaper. Although\nshe is engaged to Lon, a successful\nlawyer with an eye on a political\ncareer, and it is only a few weeks\nbefore her wedding, she feels compelled to see Noah and settle the\npast. The resulting story is of Allies\nchoice of who to marry: Noah, aTl iF PI fK NO MF. NAl.1 NTER NAl' JON ALB K STS III IR man who leads a simple life but is a poet at heart, or Lon, a man with\nconsiderable standing in her community. While this book is not a huge\ntome, the author manages to say\neverything that needs to be said\nwithout cutting the novel too short;\neven though the narrative does\nabruptly stop at the point\nwhen Allie makes her choice,\nthe reasons for this are\nexplained later on. Sparks\nwrites convincingly of the\nyoung, idealistic love found\nbetween teenagers through to\nthe enduring kind experienced\nbetween a couple who have\nbeen happily married for many\nyears. He does, however, use\na tired old clich e in his description of Allie - a stunningly\nbeautiful blonde who still manages to be attractive as an old\nwoman. As for the significance\nof the title, I can't tell you about it without giving away\nthe ending. This book will\nprobably appeal to women rather than men, although if a man manages to write about\nemotions, I'm sure there are\nguys out there who would enjoy it.\nNicole\nPublisher: Bantam\nPrice: \u00a3 6 . 9 9\nOut: now\n\n"

So hopefully we'll be offering\nthem the opportunity to allow that development as far as possible.\nAC: Student development, in particular the H&S aspect of Student develop-ment, is something that is being revised\nby Charlie at the moment. And I 've been\nreliably informed that there is a lot of\nwork that will be needed to be done next\nyear, including sorting out risk factors for\ncertain sports clubs. It's a lot of bureaucracy but its something that has to be\ndone for the whole health & safety\naspect of the clubs and societies as well.\nI wonder what you think of the current activities card system and perhaps\nhow we might do better?\nAC: The current system is very\ncheap. Although the cover you get for\nsome of the injuries isn't that great.\nHowever, it does provide insurance for\nactivities which otherwise wouldn't really be insured, and no matter how mundane and risk-free your club and society\nis, everybody should have some in sur ance. So I feel they are necessary, but\nthey could be improved in some aspects,\nsuch as the amount of cover.\nSC: I feel that they were introduced\n- only last year - as a very sort of panic\nmeasure. And I think there is no real need\nfor them. A proper insurance system\nshould sort it all out anyway. There's no\nneed to charge the students directly for\nthem.\nMoving on to the CCU clubs, which\nis obviously going to be a big issue, we\nhave a lot of CCU clubs, especially with\nthe ICSM. How do you think CCU clubs\nshould be funded, and what do you\nthink is the best way that we can\nenable them to run on all the different\ncampuses?\nSC: There's obviously a fair degree of\ndiversity of CCU clubs and spanning the\nrugby clubs to things like the RCS run an\nastronomy society. The funding for these\nis not quite the same as a standard union\nsociety, perhaps to run as a CCU society\nthey ought to essentially use the same\nfinancial guidelines. Other than that,\nthere's no reason to transfer them to\nbecome a straight ICU society.\nAC: There is a lot of duplication. With\nthe CCUs on the South Ken campus there\nis very little duplication with the large\namount of time there is in the ICU and\nCCU structures. However with the emergence of the new medical school there is\na lot of duplication, in fact there is around\n91 CCU clubs - most of which belong to\nthe School of Medicine at St Mary's. A lot\nof these clubs could, if they wanted to,\nmerge with their counterpart on another\ncampus. However this is not something\nthat I would actively force people to do.\nIf people within a society decide \"oh,\nthere's no point in having two - let's form\none club.\" Then I 'll be supporting them all\nthe way.\nThere is the mooted possibility of\na fifth sabbatical. What do you think\ntheir role should be and when would\nyou like to see them introduced?\nAC: I think that some sort of welfare\nofficer would be the best option to go\nfor. It should come in once the whole\nICU CCU structure has settled down, that\nis to say once the full integration of the\nmedics has happened, which is going to\nbe at least three years time. Once the\nclubs and socs have come together -those that will be coming together, such\nas the BUSA ones - and the whole\nICU/medic situation has totally settled\ndown, welfare is definitely the way to go.\nSC: I'd like to see perhaps a student\nbar manager, perhaps a student enter-tain ment' s, or alternatively perhaps a student sports sabbatical. With the significant increase in the number of students\non the campus, it would be nice to see a further student representative on the\nunion.\nAC: I don't really feel that a specific\nsports officer would be fair on the entire\nstudent campus, because we are there to\nrepresent all students and to have a specific sports officer that would surely benefit the sports clubs more than it would\nany other society, of which there are\nmore societies that are non-sports, than\nthere are those that do competitive and\nnon competitive sports.\nSC: However the current position of\nclubs and societies accounts for both the\nsports and non sports societies and to\ndivide it into two - for sports and non-sport would be a very easy step to take.\nWe'll finish up with some simple\nquestions. Adam, if I wanted to set up\na club, what would I need to do?\nAC: well the best person to talk to\nwould be either be the current DP(C&i>) or alternatively Mr O 'Shaunessey behind\nthe resource centre. They would give you\nall the relevant information you need. You\nthen need to apply to the CSC - the clubs\nsociety committee - which would best\nrepresent your club. For example, if you\nwere setting up a Bangladeshi society\nthen you'd be joining the Overseas\nStudents Committee.\nSimon, some possibly very simple\nones. What does BUSA stand for?\nSC: Oh, British University Sports\nAssociation [correct]\nCSC?\nSC: Err... Clubs Sub Committee?\n[wrong, Clubs and Societies Committee]\nWho is the CASA?\nSC: [long pause] Clubs And Societies\nAdministrator? [correct]\nDeputy President\n(Finance CK Services)\nJames Carter\nDave Warton\nDo you think that ULU is value for\nmoney and can you see a time we\nmight disassociate from it?\nDW: I'm not up to date on the entire\nULU situation. I don't think that we're\nfully using ULU, as in the actual building\nitself, the union building. We shouldn't be\npaying for it if people aren't using it. But\nthen again, it does have its advantages\nwith affiliations for sports and clubs\nthere.\nJC: The college actually give this\nmoney almost directly straight to ULU for\nthis. The union - aren't getting value for\nmoney out of ULU. And the question to\nask is really is college going to - if it does-n't give this money to ULU will it going to\ngive it to the union? If it wants to give it\nto the union, the that's what we want.\nTalking briefly about the multi-campus\nnature of imperial today, we obviously\nhave bars at the different campuses.\nWho do you think should run them?\nJC: The bars are very much an independent entity in such that the line managers of those bars actually take a big role\nin running the general finances of them.\nIts a question of is where the accounts\nare going through and who's seeing to\nthem. Next year I would hope that all\nbars at Imperial are financially managed,\nnot in the end of line sense, but the actual accounts are run through the South\nKensington campus. This is just a matter\nof simplicity, really and efficiency. But\nthey'll run very much the same as usual.\nDW: The union's job is to make sure\nthat the medics do have their bars run by\nsomeone, it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe the union itself, it's their job to make\nsure that someone's doing it. It's very\nimportant for the medics to have their\nbars, to keep their bars - its a big social\ngathering, but they also use it to meet\nclinical students and speaking to medics\nthey all want to use it for - to keep first\nand second years interested in the\ncourse, because some of the stuff they're\ndoing, and they want to know its all\nworth their while so the bar is an important place and with the medics coming\nover here next year, they're going to be\nwanting to use their one over at Mary's and Charring Cross one, they'll all be\nthere anyway. If the union decides to run\nit we'll have to have a we'd have to\nemploy a full time line manager over\nthere which is going to cost money and\nthen we'll have to have full time staff.\nMary's bar is run - the assistant bar managers are students, who aren't paid -they're paid in beer tokens or something\nand then you've got staff who are paid\nnormally. And that's not the way we want\nto run it because the accounts, I don't think, will be that accurate. And that is\none of the things which is causing problems with the union taking over. But 1\nthink its up to us as a union to\nmake sure that they are - the ^^LB\nbar is kept there and the service ISHM\nprovided by someone, not necessarily us.\nA few test questions now to see\nhow well you understand your financial\nmum bo jumbo.\nWhat sort of people, who are\nmembers of a club, can we actually\nsub sid is e the activity for, legally?\nDW: You can't sub sid is e political or\nreligious activities.\n[incorrect; we can sub sid is e political\nclubs, but can't sub sid is e non-members\nof ICU]\nCan you spend money on food and\ndrink, as a club?\nJC: You can if you want but you're\nnot necessarily going to get subsidy for it.\nthere's legal regulations governing subsidy on this matter. You can sub sid is e food and drink for entertainment purposes - for example an external speaker,\nwhat have you, up to 100% in terms of\nentertainment for the students that is\nlimited, there are currently regulations to\ncontrol that but I mean clubs and societies can spend whatever they like on\nentertaining people, they just can't necessarily get ICU subsidy for it.\n[partially correct - you can pay\nspeaker's expenses, and normally you\ncan't get any subsidy for food and drink]\nWhat event are you actually\nallowed to spend money on food and\ndrink for?\nDW: You can spend money entertaining a guest lecturer - you're allowed\nto spend up to \u00a325. Apart from that...\nannual dinners?\n[incorrect; you can spend money\nonly on fresher s' events, at a maximum\nsubsidy of \u00a3 1 a head]\nIf you have to get \u00a3200 in membership and you expect to have 100\nmembers, how much membership do\nyou charge?\nJC: That's quite a complicated e qua tion, because its very much dependant\non the various proportions of funding -funding for general equipment or non-general equipment and it vary much\nvaries - the income a club generates from\nmembership is brought by - made up of\ntheir total, is a proportion of their total\nbudget.\nIgnoring fractions of budgets, if\nyou know that you definitely need \u00a3200\nhow much do you charge?\nJC: You get \u00a3200 in membership?\nNo, you have a \u00a3200 budget, you have\n100 people. It depends what that \u00a3200\nis for, honestly.\nDW: What kind of clubs was it? a sporting club?\nNo, ignore all the other calculations.\nYou need \u00a3200 membership from 100\npeople.\nDW: [long pause] if you charge them\n\u00a32 you'd be sorted. You'd take, erm... 1\ncan't remember it.\n[oh dear, both getting confused! -the answer is \u00a32 each plus VAT, although\nVAT is more complicated where sports\nteams are involved]\n\n"

(London Records) \u2022\u2022\u2022\u20221/2\nG oldie, probably best known\nby most for being Gold, is\nback; one of the biggest\nnames in the D&B scene, founder\nof the hugely successful\nMetalheadz label and responsible\nfor some of the most cutting edge\n&. influential tunes over the past 5\nyears or so.\nFinally Saturnz Return is here, a follow up album that has been 2\nyears in production, not as long as\nit sounds when you take into\naccount the vast amount of tour-ing, DJ'ing, etc, Goldie's been up to\nover this period. And after all the\nhype I was unsure what to expect,\nwould it be watered down, to try\nand get mainstream coverage ?\nWell, I'm glad to say I didn't find\nany evidence of this, just innovative, deep, futuristic breaks ' n' beats.\nYou can ether buy this as a dou ble CD, with one CD containing just\none track, which is over one hour\nlong, including of a30 piece\norchestra, as well as loops, breaks\n& vocals. Entitled Mother, Goldie\nsays this track is like his childhood\nfull of pain. Or you can get the\nquadruple vinyl pack, which does-n't contain this extra track.\nRight, /'// Be There For You,\nstarts us off in a fine style, with a journey deep into the sub-concise-ness, full use is made of time-stretched beats, dark atmosphere-seems to completely change style\ninto a fat stepping.\nFury The Origin, sounds pretty\nmuch like a remix of Sinister from\nical s and a groaning b line. ChicoDeath Of A Rockstar, starts with\nclever use of an electric guitar, and\nquickly drops into a fast break-beat/spin back onslaught, with beats\ncoming in 'n' out and from speaker\nto speaker, then suddenly the track\nhis previous album ?, with Goldie's masterful use of sound in full\neffect. Demonz, is a fast paced\ntrack, futuristic sounds, excellent\nfilm vocal sample and clashing\nmetallic beats, as hard as you like.\nCrystal Clear changes the style\nto an up-beat roller, reminiscent of\na DJ Krust style. With a rolling jazz\nlick and OK female vocal. There is\nan adequate down beat number\nhere as well, with strong vocals that\nwork quite well. Temper Temper\nand Digital you should already\nknow about, so I won't go it them.\nFinally Dragon Fly brings the ,\nalbum to a close, with one final\nchange of style, a pleasant track,\nwith strong strings and tight drum\npatterns, just underlying the diversity of production techniques he\nhas mastered, a highly impressive\nalbum that seems to cover all the\nemotions, dark moody, then lighter\nrelaxed flavours, deep &. soul\nsoothing. Most of the tracks having\na definite dark old skool feel, which\nis probably because Goldie invented the sound in the first place.\nSo this album can be listened to\nas a complete album and you're\ntaken on a pleasant, sometimes\nintimidating journey through what\nis known as drum &. bass. And for\nall the Dj's out there, there are\nplenty of playable singles on here\nas well, ncl Jo Public\n\n"

    "content": "16\nCLUB SCENE THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE MUSIC 20 February 1998\ntrie cam\nHi and welcome to another edition of the\nElectric Cafe. Lots to tell you this week, so I 'll\nget straight on with it!\nFirst up I want to plug a one-off night that 1\nam doing next week at Imperial. Many of you have said that if there was an alternative club in\nthe area to visit, that you would be there. In the\nnear future a few of us are thinking of putting on\nsome parties for students who are into anything\nelectronic. As a prelude to that the Electric Cafe\nwill be stepping out of the radio studio and into\nSouthside next Thursday 26 February. I 'll be the\nDJ from 7 pm until I1 pm. The first two hours will\nbe a chill-out selection, but then I 'll be upping\nthe tempo to play my favourite house / techno /\nd'n'b/ breakbeat s of recent shows.\nThere are two reasons for this. I want to provide an alternative for people who are interested in different types of music. Other people are\nunable to do this through no fault of their own, but simply because they are under the pressure\nof having to please the majority of people and\nkeep a profit coming in. Also Southside disco is\nunder the care of IC radio and we want to show how it can be used. For example we want to\nmake it into a chill-out area to make it a relaxed\nplace to drink in if you are already in Southside.\nIt seems really negative that people have been\ncriticising the place since it was first used as a disco, but no one really wants to do something\nabout it. It has potential and we aim to use it. If\nyou're interested in or curious about underground electronic music with plenty of funk, the\nI'd love to see you there!\nIf you read the column last week you will\nremember that I wrote about Air Liquide from\nCologne. On Friday night I was lucky enough to\ngo and see them play live at the 333 Club in Old Street. It seemed the whole of underground\nCologne was over for this. The flyer boasted\nover 10 DJs and live acts from Liquid Sky (Air\nLiquide's own club night in Germany). It was not\neasy to tell in advance whether they would be\nany good. Unfortunately we never seem to see\na lot of visiting DJs in London, except the big\n\"names\". So this party turned out to be a refreshing change.\n1 started off upstairs in the chill-out room. Despite being part of a commercial nightclub, it\nhad the appearance and feel of a room in some one's flat. The atmosphere was very relaxing\nand friendly. Most of the Liquid Sky DJs were\ncamped out there all night, giving us a display of\nsome excellent music. From deep Detroit to\nexperimental Cologne; abstract breakbeat s and\nsome light drum'n 'bass, just about everything\nwas represented!\nThe ground floor of the 333 is a large bar\narea. It is not the most glamourous or well-dec-orated club in the world, but it certainly gives\nthe occupant the feeling of space. There was\nroom to breathe and it was well-ventilated. A Cologne DJ called Strobocop was my personal\nhighlight in that area, playing a set that lasted\nmost of the night. He produced an awesome display of records and a well-thought out style\nin the way he put everything together. For me it\nwas also a musical education, because I hadn't heard many of the records he played. The beauty of his set was that it didn't fit inside any\nboundaries or fall into a category. If you wanted\nto analyse him, you would be asking yourself, \"Is\nthis house or techno or breakbeat or electro or\nwhat?!\" Strobocop really did keep the crowd on\nhis side throughout, and even got into it. You\ncould tell he was enjoying himself!\nAir Liquide - Live and Dangerous\nDown in the cellar we were faced with the\nprospect of a live \"jam session\" between Air\nLiquide and the Bionaut and Frank Heiss. The\nmajority of the London underground had\nassembled for this. What a treat it turned out to\nbe for most people! On the whole 1 thought\nsome parts were awesome, for example a really\ndark and rhythmic techno encounter that led\nstraight into a salsa-fueled number. The techno\nwas still underneath so this was latin funk, but it\nwas hard, and it was fast. The crowd were really going crazy here. There were many other\nthings that had a similar effect. At certain points\nI did feel a bit lost and switched off to the\nmusic. All in all however, everyone involved put\non a fantastic show. Well done to Phuture Trax\nfor the organisation.\nThis week's Electric Cafe radio show will feature the work of Si Begg. Si Begg has recorded\nhis own inimitable style of electronic funk for a variety of labels, under a multitude of guises.\nWhether it be the quirky techno of Bigfoot\nL \u2022 '\n(Eukatech records), the hip-hop/breakbeat mad ness of Cabbage Boy (Ninja Tune) or the crazy\nfreestyle funk of Buckfunk 3 0 0 0 (Language) this\na guy who just believes in throwing it all in and\nseeing what comes out. The show will mostly be\nconcentrating on Buckfunk 3000. This week\nsees the release of a new album by Si under this\npseudonym. Called First Class Ticket to Telos, it\nis inspired by the episodes of Dr Who that Si\nused to watch as a kid (the Cybermen came\nfrom a planet called Telos!).\nThe album is worth checking out. In my\nopinion it is a reflection of Si's persona. He has\nbecome known as a techno artist in techno c ir cles, as a funk artist in the ranks of tech-house,\nand as a hip-hop/scratch DJ in the Ninja/Mo'Wax\ncommunity. But his style is never one nor the\nother. Si just does what he does and doesn't care whether people are able to label it. In his\ninterview for the Electric Cafe, Si talks of his\nboredom with the whole minimal techno thing,\nwhere everything is becoming very contrived. Si\nsees his mission as just recording the music he\nlikes, not the music that people want him to\nmake in order to keep a certain scene \"alive\".\nThe show will also feature a half-hour mix\nfrom Si Begg, who is quite comfortable on the\ndecks or playing out live. The playlist for this mix\nreads like a who's who of house and techno.\nWhat sets it apart from other mixes is the way in\nwhich it has been designed and constructed. Si\nadmires current artists from the hip-hop scene,\nwhom he explains can actually create original\nmusic from scratching records. He cites Kid\nKoala and the Invisible Scratch Pickles.\nSi claims that he still has a long way to go to\nreach that level, but his mix gives an indication\nof his direction. Scratching and cutting and pasting techno? This will probably not please the\n\"establishment\", but having spent time with Si 1\nnoticed a very independent streak in him. He certainly believes in himself, and will set modesty aside if he honestly believes that he has\ncreated something that is good.50 listen to the Electric Cafe for some news\nfrom the very edge of electronic music and\nsome views from an artist who is on a mission\nto boldly go where no cyber funk er has been\nbefore. 1998 will be the year of the Buckfunk.\nYou have been warned!\nYou could win a copy of the Buckfunk 3000\nalbum (First Class Ticket to Telos) if you answer\nthis simple question.\n51 Begg has recorded some EPs for a label\ncalled Tresor. Can you name the country of\norigin of Tresor? Is it (a) Germany, (b) Holland, or (c) Ecuador?\nAnswers by email to a. seth i@ ic.ac.uk or by\nhand to the Felix office.\nListen to the Electric Cafe for the full interview with Si Begg, his half hour freestyle mix and\na selection of his music.\nSunday / Monday22 February midnight-2am or Tuesday 24 February 10-1 1pm. al;ck.\n\n"

Both are\nslightly out of the ordinary but\nshould be fairly simple and their methods are nearly the\nsame.\nCarrot Cake\n\u00ab\" 6 oz carrots\n\u00ab\u2022 4 oz brown sugar\n\u00ae\" 3 fl oz sunflower oil\n4 oz whole meal self raising flour\n*\u2022 2 eggs\n*\" 1 tsp ground cinnamon\n:\n*' 'A tsp ground nutmeg\nGrate the carrots using the\nspiky side of a cheese grater.\nTry not to grate the ends of\nyour fingers as well, it hurts\nlots and just isn't worth it.\nWhisk the eggs and the\nsugar together until all the\nsugar is dissolved. Slowly dribble the oil in, whisking away all\nthe time. The oil should be\ncompletely incorporated so give it a good whirl. Next add the grated carrots and all their\njuice and mix well. Finally fold\nin the flour and add a pinch of\nsalt for good luck.\nPour the mixture into your\nwell-greased cake tin (anything\nwill do but you should end up\nwith about an inch of slurry in\nthe tin) and place in you preheated oven (190\u00b0C, gas mark\n5) for 2 0 to 25 minutes. To\ncheck if the cake is cooked,\nstick a clean knife blade into it\nand bring it out slowly. If any\ndough sticks to the knife the\ncake isn't cooked yet. If it\ncomes out clean, your masterpiece is ready.\nPoppyseed Cake\nThis one has a nice crunchy\nfeel to it and could even get\nyou high if you eat several\ntonnes of it (don't try this any-where, kids!).\n* 3 oz poppy seed \u00ae 4 oz brown sugar\n\u00bb 8 oz whole meal self raising flour\n\u00ae* 1 '/z oz milk powder\n\u00ae- 1/3 pt milk\nsr> 2 eggs\n\u00bb\" Vi tsp almond essence\n*\u2022 1 tsp ground cinnamon\nSoak 2 oz of the poppy seeds in the milk for about 1\nhour.\nWhisk the eggs and sugar\ntogether until they are creamy\nand then add the oil and essence just as for the carrot\ncake. Incorporate the milk and poppy seed mix and then fold\nin the flour.2\nPour into your cake tin,\nsprinkle with the remaining\npoppy seeds and put in the\noven (190\u00b0C, gas mark 5) for\n20 to 25 minutes.\nEnjoy with a dab of cream.\nAntoine\nThought for the Day:\nSportsmen of the World Ignite\nYes! We won! I'm so great! The\nnation is a better place!\nAs1 write this, Butcher and Cad dick have just run\nEngland to victory in the\nblooper-dominated and crushing ly tense second Test match against\nthe West Indies; as the distinguished gaffe r Christopher MartinJenkins reliably informs us, it is the\nfirst time in several decades that\n\"us lot\" have won a Test match in\nthe Carribean. In the dying seconds\nof all-pervading, pure, white-hot\ntension that pervaded dBs, the\ncheer arising from the assembled\nthrong was that of sheer blood-lust,\nwhen at any other point in the\ngame, the quality of the scoring\nwould have induced little more\nthan a groan. It occurred to me, then and there, that sport in mo dern times occupies a social, even\nphysical, niche, which may be satisfied by nothing else.\nI wouldn't have cared to have been\nMark Butcher half an hour ago. I wouldn't have been very happy filling Atherton's shoes either. The\nhopes of a nation rested upon\nthem; men with power to make or\nbreak the days of tens, even hundreds of thousands of fans. My mind, however hard I try to stop it,\nflips painfully back to Gareth\nSouthgate's missed penalty.Few\nconcepts ever induce such ecstasy,\nsuffering, fury and relief; the male,\nhis natural instincts stifled by soci-e ty, has just one outlet left. This is\nwhy we stand in front of the big\nscreen, screaming obscenities, as\nthough it were some Druidic altar\nof emotion, bringing bliss and disappointment in equal measures, a furiously addictive drug, in toxic at ing, infatuating, and legally injected\ninto our homes and pubs from\nabove, at the speed of light. All else\nis forgotten; pints are dropped in a creamy shower of ale as the ball\ncurls, parabolic ally, into the top corner of the net...In fact, I strongly suspect that when Moses disappeared up Sinai to receive the Ten\nCommandments, the divine thunderbolt heralded little more than\nthe Jerusalem United score.\nSociety truncates mankind's gut\nfeelings and emotions. As we become more civilised; as atrocities ate systematically eradicated;\nas cruelty, in all its forms, is slowly\nmade illegal; and in the absence of\nlive executions, we have just one\noutlet left; the organised war of\nsport. In both participation and in\nworship, the fetters of reality, of\nwork and daily humdrum, are bro-ken.\nWhy do we have the phrase \"foot-ball hooliganism\"? Why is soccer\nlinked so readily to violence? The\nclich ed arguments are manifold;\ncowardly safety in vast numbers,\npeer group pressures, drunken ness. No. People fight because of\nunadulterated hatred; often xe no phobic, even racist; induced, provoked and unreal, yes; but it exists,\nand it can occasionally kill.\nSo the job of our poor sportsmen,\nit seems, is an important task\nindeed. You think their wages are\nextortionate? You think they have it\neasy? I think not. They carry the\nsanity, maybe even the safety of\nmillions in their muddy gloved\nhands.\nAli Campbell\n\n"

Ben Ferry took over, driving\ncleanly &. bringing us back from\neighth to fourth. Next up was Niall\nDarwin who brought us back to\nsecond but got us another penalty\nby speeding in the pit lane (Doh!)\nat the end of his stint. Phil took\nover again, sat out Niall's one\nminute penalty then went &. moved us up into first place!\nDuring re-fuelling &. driver\nchanges we traded the lead with\nthe best Cambridge team (No. 5).\nTowards the end of the race,\nPhil while leading attempted to lap\nteam 5 but was blocked by their\ndriver. This cost them a stop-go\npenalty and handed us a four lap\nlead. Ben had an uneventful final\nstint handing over a kart with truly\ncooked brakes to Niall. This\ncaused Niall a change-of-under-wear situation when the kart\nrefused to stop at the hairpin, but\nhe survived this and went on to\ntake the chequered flag, seven laps\nclear.\nThe champagne was sprayed\nby Phil over two pissed twelve year\nolds that Niall was chatting up &.\npoured over Ben.

We totally dig\nthis so keep them coming. I must\napologise if reports appear late or if\nthey are edited to the point of\nin comprehensibility. But you know,\nfortunes of war and all that.\nWhilst I would I would sooner\nmurder my grandmother than tell\nyou how to go about your bus i ness, Ido ask that reports are\nhanded in as soon as possible and\nare legible, particularly the \"hilari-o us\" nicknames that you see fit to\ngive one another. Also, and this is\npurely my own opinion, I think that\nfar too many clubs seem to insult\ntheir opponents, particularly when they are victorious. Whilst in many\ncases it may be appropriate, it's not terribly sporting.\nWhile I'm in a critical mood, I'm shocked and saddened by the\ntreatment of former shooting club\nstalwart, Lee Clements at the\nhands of her Majesty's Customs\nand Excise Department. During a recent return from his Swiss tax-haven, he was cruelly detained at\nthe airport after ridiculous claims\nthat he was smuggling in his body,\nparts necessary for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.\nThis was of course ridiculous.\nX rays showed that the \"suspicious\" artefact was merely a harmless electric whisk. It is my sad\nduty to tell you that the fascists\nwho run customs offered no apology. Indeed they even cast ugly\naspersions as to how the whisk\ncame to be lodged up his rectum\nin the first place. Such behaviour is\nunacceptable from public servants\nand I urge everyone to complain\nto their MP. Never let them take you alive.\nThe sports team.\nP.S. For the benefit of Mr Nick\nOliver, the last part of this editorial is not true.\nYou Can't Hyde\nOn a glorious Saturday afternoon,\nover 750 runners gathered in Hyde\nPark to compete in the 50th Hyde\nPark Relays. At 2 o 'clock the men's race began.The women's race started 5 minutes later, with Imperial\nleading the way.\nThe first leg went well for the\nImperial A teams, with the women in first place, and the men in 8th. The remaining Imperial\nteams sprinkled strategically through the field.\nOver the course of the following 4 8 minutes the\nmen's race hot ted up and\nthe women's team battled\nfor places. The winning\nwomen's team was Oxford\nA, with Imperial A coming a more than respectable\n4th, and Jennie Cox running the fastest lap of the\nday.\nWhilst the women relaxed in the\nsun, the men pushed on, with\nLeeds A team storming home. They\nwere led home by Mick Hill, who posted the fastest men's lap of the\nday. Imperial A were not far behind\nfinishing in 8th place.\nFormer Olympian Peter Elliott\nrepresenting the sponsoring company View From, was on hand to\npresent the impressive array of\nprizes (including the Gary Hoare\nwooden spoons). For the first time\nin since 1968, the Sir Roderic Hill\ntrophy could again be presented,\nalbeit briefly, to the winning men's team. This trophy awarded at the\nfirst ever race has been recovered\nfrom Edinburgh after a long holiday.\nPresentations are notoriously\ndry events, but this one was brightened by the fastest foreign\nmen's team lead by the\nperpetual student joo s de\nBaaker, who chose to\nthank Dawn (event organiser and Superwoman) in\nhis own special way! The\nslowest women's team\nfrom Maastrict University\nwere slightly bemused by\ntheir wooden spoon....\nAll that remained was\nto party the night and\nunfortunately not the\nmorning away in the Union. Much beer was drunk, thrown and worn\nby all (disturbing considering the\nlarge number of supposedly highly\ntrained athletes). Even the stewards\nagreed that it was one of the best\nnights at the Union for a long time!\nMany people have expressed their\nappreciation, and at the end of the\nday it was all worth it!\nBEST TIMES\nMens Teams\n1 Leeds A89:072 Oxford A90:033 Brunei College 91:48\n4 Cambridge A92:41 Womens Teams\n1 Oxford A48:262 Brunei College 4 9 : 4 6\n3 Cambridge A50:454 Imperial A50:55 Fastest Lap\nMen: Mick Hill (Leeds) 14:26\nWomen: Jennie Cox (Imperial) 1 1:42\n\n"

Chan and the said\nAccommodation Officer, however,\nsuch disputes are rarely one-sided.\nAlthough I can understand that the\nstudent was clearly very upset Iam diss a pointed that the Editor\nallowed publication of this com plaint given that it was of such a personal nature.\nSurely the student would have\nbeen far better advised to seek help\nfrom a tutor or their\nAccommodation Union Repin order to resolve this matter. Public\nslang ing only perpetuates hurt and\nresentment and rarely resolves any-thing.\nClive Wells\nA Hall of Residence Warden AND FOR THE\nLAST TIME: OIL.\nDear Felix,\nOnce again I find myself reading Simon Baker's column( issue\n1107) and realising how ill informed he is about the oil indus-try. To suggest that the oil industry\nin general is not responsible for\nenvironmental damage and denial\nof global warming is foolish. One only has to read Roger Geffen's article in Felix (issue 1 1 0 1 , 5 th of December, still available on the\nFelix web pages) to learn of the\nattempts and success of the Global\nClimate Coalition (GCC) to scupper\nthe Kyoto Climate Change\nConference held in December of last year.\nThe GCC is an organisation\ndedicated to discrediting climate\nchange by funding the minority of\nscientists in the field of climate\nchange who are skeptical of climate\nchange and public ising their findings in a way that will make people\nbelieve it is the opinion of the whole scientific community. The\nGCC funded a huge advertising\ncampaign on American television\nduring the run up to the Kyoto\nConference to create a fear of a possible fall in living standards due to curtailment of the use of oil. I would consider moving away from\noil and towards renewable energy\nsources would raise living stan-dards. When1 come out of\nGloucester Road tube station every\nmorning on my way into college I have to put up with the foul stench\nof exhaust fumes. Is this really\ngood for us, is this price worth paying for the freedom to drive, or\nwould we be better off if there was\nno traffic, belching noxious fumes\ninto the same air we have to breathe? Surely a life without oil\nwould be a better one.\nSo who are the members of\nthe GCC? Shell, Exxon (known as\nEsso in Europe), Mobil, Texaco and\nChevron to name a few, but also\nthose reliant on oil like Ford,\nGeneral Motors( known as Vauxhall\nin Britain) and the American Automobile Manufacturers\nAssociation. The likes of BP and Shell UK may admit to a link\nbetween the burning of fossil fuels\nand global warming but the American companies are still firmly\nin denial. As for the issue of environmental destruction, at every\nstage of oil use from exploration,\nextraction, transportation, refining\nand consumption there is pollution\nall the way. As for BP trying to look\n'green' with its solar division, a little\nfurther reading reveals that BP actually spend more money public ising their research facilities for\nrenewable energy than they spend\non the research itself. This leads\nme to believe that BP solar is little\nmore than a PR stunt. But don't just\ntake my word for it, have a read:\nhttp://www.oneworld.org/cw/mag-a zine/ issue4/ oil.html\nB. Canning, Chem2 IN DEFENCE OF\nTHE UNIONS\nDear Jeremy,\nWhilst Iam grateful for your\ndrawing attention to the great need\nfor better student academic representation (\"Time to abolish CCUs\",\neditorial, Felix issue 1 106), 1 think\nthat you are wrong to call for CC Us to be got rid of.\nThe CC Us help to provide an\nimmediate sense of identity and promote a feeling of belonging.\nThey are more able to do this than\nICU because they are so much\nsmaller and because, due to the\nlayout of the college, one is far\nmore likely to meet up with students from the same C CU than\nfrom others in the course of a normal college day. The bar nights\norganised by the CC Us are also\nmore intimate and conducive to making new friends than the events\norganised by ICU Ents (conducive\nto pulling someone you've never\nmet before rather than someone\nyou've been after for a while).\nIn academic and welfare issues,\nthere are likely to be significant\nsimilarities between the problems\nwhich students from a particular\nC CU face. There are, of course, difficulties we all have such as ac como dati on: these are a job for ICU.\nICU provides valuable facilities,\nwhich allow us to meet up with\nother students from all areas of the\ncollege. This integration is obviously desirable, but so is the developing of contacts within subject areas\nsimilar to our own.1 agree that some aspects of\nthe CC Us are currently archaic (e.g. mascot ry) but, as I have just\nexplained, there are also some very\nimportant functions, which they\nperform. We should modernise and\nimprove upon the good work,\nwhich many CC Us do, rather than\nreject them because they're not yet\nas good as they could be. As to\nyour specific example - a student\nhas problems with a lecturer; what\ncan he or she do? Your suggestion\nis, \"At present, not much.\" I would\ninstead give the answer- speak to\nyour year reps/ dep rep/ academic\naffairs officer. They should be able\nto address the problem at the next\nstaff/student committee meeting at\nthe very latest. (External assessors\nevaluating a department often ask\nto have a look at the minutes from\nthese meetings to check\nthat problems are being dealt with-this should encourage the department to act.) If you receive no help\nfrom any of these people, tell your\nsenior tutor and/ or your C CU or\nICU that the representatives aren't doing their jobs properly. You could\ntry talking to the lecturer involved-some of them do pay heed to the\npeople they are being employed to\nteach!\nYours sincerely,\nDebbie Middleton.( joint R SMU academic affairs\nofficer)\nP.S.A reminder to all stu-dents... the time for election of\nnew C CU officers is upon us. If\nthere's anything you think they can\ndo better, share your ideas and get\ninvolved.\nHAIR SALON\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT& BLOW DRY BY OUR TOP STYLISTS \u00a3 1 5 LADIES \u00a3 1 3 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nTelephone 0171 823 8968\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES "

For an absolute food lover\nlike myself, it's nice know that once a year the\nrefractory won't smell of burgers, chips and\nbelow average school dinners replaced by a multitude of authentic meals from around the\nworld.\nAnd so to the\nsaviours of my\nempty stomach, the\nItalian Society\nThe only catch was that, with only two food\ncoupons, the decision of which food to try from\na dozen different nationalities was not going to\nbe easy. However 1 was guaranteed something\ndifferent as my taste buds cried out for something other than Union's \u00a3 1 . 1 0 curries and\nSCR's salad and soup. The first choice was a simple one, as there is something endearing\nabout Japanese food. My introduction to\nJapanese food last year by a good friend had\nme making ab line to the Japanese Society\nstall. After handing over my coupon1 was close\nto heaven experiencing the exquisite taste and\ntexture of the rice and seaweed, a prawn and\nslice of meat.\nJapanese food is beautiful but seriously\nlacks that filling factor. And so to the saviours of\nmy empty stomach, the Italian Society. They\ngave the best deal of the night, those who stuck\naround were repaid with generous helpings of\nfree pizza and alas Basics will never taste the\nsame again. The only problem with having a small number of coupons is that it limits the\nnumber stalls you can visit. 1 would personally\nprefer smaller portions with the chance of trying out a larger ranger of foreign delights.\nThe food fair, rather more diverse than the\nlocal take away, seemed a little quiet this year.\nThere were some fears that not enough tickets\nwere sold, but price reductions towards the end\nof the evening soon e livia ted some that pro b lem. At least, my fear of a huge mad rush for\nthe best food never materialise d and it was still\npossible to find a snack well after the first hour\n- chance to sav our rather than scoff.\nExperiencing a different culture is one thing but\nbeing at odds with your own traditions was\nflavour from the Indian Society with their marital problems sketch, while the Bangladeshi\nSociety really hit home the highs and lows of\nexperiencing a different culture with their story\nabout two brothers. The best act has to go to\nSingapore Society whose Rasa Sayang song and\nkindergarten look (even with students dressed\nup as flowers) still sticks in my head.\nI was not disappointed with any of the acts\nthis year, I saw a bewildering amount of raw tal-ent, live origami folding on a huge scale, folk\nstories, folk dances, belly dancing, and even a song about a cactus plant care of the newly\nformed German Society. The night generally ran\nwithout incident, except for one no show,\nthough the hosts Elaine, Ben and Rathna kept\nup the comic relief.\nLondon is a truly international city, and from\nthe 100 different nationalities at IC we have the\nbest of the whole world.\nWriting by Wei Lee, Pictures by Ivan Chan and\nThomas Deltombes.\nIBSiB\nMy thanks go to all at the\nOS C for satisfying the general public and my stomach (for free). Especially to\nall the societies, their talent is unbelievable, to\nTanya Siraa - Vice Chair,\nfor all the her funny comments that unfortunately\ncan't be printed.\n\n"

    "content": "20 February 1998 MUSIC 15\nALBUMS THE CHARLATANS\nMelting Pot * * * *\nSo, they've decided to release\na 'best of album. \"They've\nsold out to the worst commercial trick in the book\", many of\nyou may cry. Well, the Charlies may\nalso have surprised themselves,\nbecause around the time of the\nrelease of their third album, Up To\nOur Hips, they were pretty noncommittal about anything of the\nsort, nearly angry that anyone\nwould date mention such a thing.\nWhy have they done it then?\nWell, it can be looked on as good and bad. Firstly, the Charlies only\ntruly achieved true mass recognition after the release of The\nCharlatans (album number four),\nand further increased their popularity with the most recent one, Tellin'\nStories (number five). With the\nrelease of this greatest hits effort,\nmany fans who have only heard the\nlast two albums will get a taste of\nthe material on the previous\nalbums, probably the stuff the\nCharlies reckon is the best. From\nthe first album, which debuted at\nnumber one, they've included the\nsingles (The Only One I Know, etc.\nfrom the baggy days of indie) and\nthe psychedelic, Opportunity\nThree, a non-album version that\nspans a whole nine minutes.\nEven if you' re a diehard Charlatans fan with all the records,\nthis album is still worth a listen or\nthree because it contains moments\nof brilliance unlike any previous\nwork. Songs like Over Rising, one of\nthe EPs released between their first\nand second albums, and the\nChemical Brothers remix of Patrol\n(previously aB side) particularly\nstand out.\nThe Charlatans are probably the\nonly band still around today that\nemerged f tom the Manchester baggy indie scene. Most of their\nfellow bands have long since disappeared, think of famous examples\nsuch as the Stone Roses split, the\nnon-event of the Inspiral Carpets\ndemise, and the Happy Mondays morph os is into Black Grape, whose\nfuture doesn't exactly look too rosy\neither. Tim Burgess and co were\nnever considered the pioneers of\nthe baggy scene, and were always\nrated second best to the Stone\nRoses, yet they have stuck through\nit all, even though they were being\nwritten off after their seon d LP.\nSomehow, they have managed\nto develop a new sound with each\nalbum release, and we can only\nhope that they carry on long\nenough to bring out another 'best\nor. ra Jason\nVARIOUS\nRide - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack * * * *\nAnother fantastic soundtrack\nto represent a film that\nprobably no one will see.\nHowever, to counteract this 1 am going to play a game to give a possible insight into what the film may\nbe like. Artists in bold, track titles\nin italics...\n\"...The Weekend was where it\nall began. Erick Sermon and Redman were rapping and rhyming, pushing the heat up. NoS INGLES one recognised the Symptoms of\nwhat was about to happen.\nBackstage Rufus Blaq was Outta Sight trying to sort out the\nBlood Money for Nas and Nature.\nThey had sorted out some Soldier\nFunk for him and were Callin' for\nthe Came to be sorted. No-one\nknew who had started 77re Came,\nbut it was clear that if word of it\never reached the Wu-Tang and\nOnyx, who were at this time colla b orating, The Worst was sure to\nhappen.\nRufus knew he had only one\nreal choice. He had to escape, and\nget over to where the Eastsiders\ncould protect him. The Eastsiders\nwere lead by the Black Caesar and\nhis right-hand man Phife, a mem ber of the infamous Tribe Called\nQuest. The only thing stopping him\nwas his Never Say Goodbye pact\nwith Adrianna Evans.\nAdrianna was trouble, but she\nhad a way of making Rufus feel\nhigher than ever before. She was\nthe ex-girlfriend of Eric Benet, and\nhad split with him aft et his run in\nwith Trina and Tamara. Eric, how-ever, still wanted her and therefore\nwanted Rufus dead...\"H James\nSnow Patrol - Little Hide\nInitially pleasingly reminiscent of My Bloody\nValentine but they don't build on this. Thin\nvocals and a lack of imagination make for a worthless pile of poo. Nick Heyward - Stars In Her Eyes\nThis is good for a whole five seconds before\ndescending into the type ponce y pap with dull\nvocals and the requisite piano. Let's just say that\nthis song wouldn't be out of place in an\nelevator....\nUltrasound - Best Wishes\nReally rather pleasant and very atmospheric with\nan odd but likeable singer. Not truely outstanding but is certainly worth looking in to.\nUltrasound could well be one to watch.\nJames lha - Be Strong Now\nAnyone expecting Smashing Pumpkins-esque\nguitar work outs are going to be majorly disappointed with this lifeless, light, country-type\nsong. It could have been written and played by\nanyone and though his voice is actually fairly\ngood I expected much better from such a talented guitarist\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Stereophonies - Local Boy In The Photograph\nReally catchy quality indie-pop which will do well in the charts and will be played all day on\nMTV I expect. Unintentionally an the mic, bouncy\nstuff. Thick but light guitar with strong, distinctive vocals.\nDaytona - American Disco Dancer\nStraight forward light, puerile, radio-friendly\nindie which uses too many clich es for its own good. Not te trible enough to slate with my normal glee but hardly the best thing since that 98p burger offer.\nNovocaine - Million Miles\nUnsurprising and st taigh t forward processed\nrock with \"en vogue\" distorted vocals in an\nacceptable attempt to be dark and menacing.\nVaguely catchy for some reason but it really isn't very good at all.\nWubble U Petal\nAt last! A really crap single to review. Some\nweird blok ej ibb ers over random crap which is a larger cheese test than when they opened the\nEU cheese mountain to the public. Never before\nhave I heard such a pile of pants as this.\nRegurgitator - / Sucked A Lot Of Cock To Get\nWhere I Am\nThe girls in my flat wanted this to be single of\nthe week because they could emphasise with\nthe title... Anyway, it is actually rather good and\nthe B side is even better with some incredibly\ncool heavy sections. A very original sound and\nstyle. LTI\nMartin\n\n"

SLIPPERY TOPIC\nDear Felix,\nIam writting to comment on this weeks (Feb 13th) Simon Baker\ncolumn, for Mr Baker to complain\nof someone 'clogging up Felix with\nsilly distortions' is one of the blatant cases of the pot calling the\nkettle black I 've read in a long time.\nDismissing what S uz zane Aigrain as a 'dubious, sweeping\nstatement' that 'is rubbish' is obviously the comments of someone with a strange view of reality or the\nfacts. If you agree or disagree with\nthe practises of the oil industry,\nthere can be no doubts on the\nenvironmental impact of oil ex plo ration. )ust look at the effects that\noil industry has had on the environment and people in areas of\nNigeria, Columbia and Peru or,\ncloser to home, last years spill off\nthe Pembrokeshire coast.\nIt may not be the role of the\nsupplier to suppress its sales, but\nevery supplier / manufacturer has a moral and legal duty of care for the\nhealth, safety and general wellbeing of their employees, their working conditions and the local\nenvironment that they effect\nthough there action or inaction.\nThe oil industry could, very rightly,\nbe accused of neglecting this duty\nof care, parti cully in developing\ncountries.\nWhile it is obvious that the only\nreason that the column ex sits is to\nstir up controversy, it would be\nnice if Mr Baker occassional y checked his facts before putting\npen to paper. Finally I must say\nthat the position of the Simon Baker column directly opposite a full page advert for Shell travel bur-s aries sums up the colleges\nposition quite eloquently.\nKeith Hatch\nChemistry\nThe irony of the placement of the\nShell advert was not lost on me. I had seriously considered refusing\nthe advert, but 1 decided the benefit of what amounted to 'free\nholidays' to IC students outweighed the desire to avoid pub-li c ising this company of dubious\nreputation. Ed\nIT'S THE OLD\n(YAWN) APATHY\nDEBATE AGAIN\nDear Felix\nI 've been thinking lately about\nthat old bugbear I.C. Apathy, and\nwondering how much Felix is to\nblame. Normally I hate the old\ngrannies who write in to points of\nview moaning about how the news\nis always bad... but after a year of\nbookshop takeovers, exams in\ntents, conference centre management problems, I begin to wonder\nwhether we go looking for things to\ndepress us. You'll have to excuse\nthe out of date examples - I'm in\nFrance, and have only rare net\naccess so haven't got round to\nreading this year's Felixes - and\nwho knows, maybe they're full of\njoy. But my point, and yes, I did\nhave one, somewhere, is that we tend to walk around with our eyes\nclosed and our ears blocked. Yes\nwe all know that I.C. produces fantastic scientific research - after all that's supposedly while we're here\n- but what else do we know about\nour college. I'm sure that in infact\nits a hive of interesting activity -O.K. maybe the bees aren't making\na lot of noise, but they're still\nbuzzing. In one single issue of I.C. reporter over the summer, I disc over ed that Dr David Phillips\nholds the prestigious Faraday Prize\nfor Science Lectures, that Dr\nCaroline Baillie has been awarded\nmillenium funding for her work in\nscience theatre, and then in passing I heard that the Great Hall is\none of the most coveted concert\nvenues in London...why aren't we inspired by these kind of things in\nour daily college life?\nFortunately, some of us are -and here comes the usual Dramsoc\nplug - If you want to break the\nmould of the stereotypical scientist\nslowly wasting away from bored om, come and find out about A we the new ICUDS science theatre\nproject for 7-9 Year olds - we're\ngoing to be creating theatre which\nreveals the magical in the everyday\n- a magic where the rules of science are the spells and under-Deadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday.

It is also important\nfor those who do not agree with\nthe policies and ideas of the speakers in question to attend events,\nensuring a good balance is struck.\nAlun Hart\nChe mI GIVE A DOG A BONE\nDear Editor,\nI would like to write in support\nof the good( and often thankless)\njob that the Accommodation Office\nprovides to Imperial College stu-dents. I was dismayed by the article from C. Chan (6 Feb 1997) [try\n1998 - Ed] which was extremely\noffensive and frankly racist. What\nmany people may not realise is the\nconstant abuse that members of\nthe accommodation office have to\nendure during their normal working\nday.

The\nevent, to be held in Alexandra\nPalace, is open to all stu-dents, graduates and staff of\nIC and is set to rival the well-known Oxbridge May balls.\nIncluded in the evening's entertainment will be a string\nquartet reception, a three-course meal, drinks, a headline band and other entertainments such a casino and possibly a bouncy castle.\nTransport to and from ICU\nwill also be included in the\nticket price.\nThe project is the brainchild of four 1SE students\nwho, disappointed at the lack\nof an established summer event, \"thought we should\nget off our arse s and do it our-selves.\" They have attempted to\ngain support from Imperial College,\nICU and outside companies since\nlast term. The turning point came\nlast Tuesday, when an emergency\nmeeting of the Union Finance\nCouncil was called and the organisers announced that they had\nsecured \u00a3 1 5 , 0 0 0 corporate sponsorship. UFC then voted unanimously to underwrite the event. A Summer Ball Committee was then\nset up to deal with the finances this\nyear. Members were also pleased\nto learn that the event may not be\nsubject to VAT, depending on the\nfunding structure.\nThe sponsorship money has\nbeen pledged by the firm EDS and\nwas obtained via the 1C Alumni\nRelations Office, the Managing Director of EDS being an IC g radu ate. \"EDS came to college wanting\nto sponsor something\", revealed\nLing Li, one of the four initiators,\niB \"eight proposals were given to\nHHSHHI them, including minibus sponsor\u2122 ship, but EDS themselves chose\nthe summer ball\".

Mr Sexton responded to\nthis, pointing out that whilst vast\nnumbers of magazines are available with reviews and features,\nonly Felix carries IC news.\nQuestioned on the subject of\nfunding, Alok felt that accepting\nmore advertising would allow Felix\nmore freedom from the Union,\nand provide more money to produce a better magazine. Mr Sexton, however, suggested that\nstudents didn't want a paper cluttered up with pointless ads. Both\ncandidates promised to target\nmulti-campus involvement, with\nEd proposing reps on each site,\nwhilst Alok pledging to visit both\nCharing Cross and Mary's fort-nightly.\nMoving on to the two candidates for Deputy President (Finance\n&.

So make\nup your own mind.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNo Stars\nALBUMS LIBIDO\nKilling Some Dead Time. * * * *\nLibido: You may be familiar\nwith Overthrown, as it's Libido's current single. It's a guitar-pop rush to the veins of student radio stations. You only have\nto hear it a few times before the\njaunty rhythm and iy ric s go bouncing round your sonic memory cells.\nIf it's a quick shot of guitar pop that\nyou're after, then listen to Cod's Guest List, the lo-fi-ish Molest Me\nand Blow which is probably the\nbest song of its type on the album.\nThe calm delivery of the verses\ncontrasts well with the explosion of\nfrustration that is the chorus, where\nEven Johansen rasps, 'When I try\nand tell you, you just smile at me\nand say, won't you leave it 'til\nsome other day.'\nHowever, the album's standout\ntrack is Remarkably Abnormal.\nEssentially, it is two different songs\ntitled as one. The first part is a slow, dark, deep and swampy affair\nwith a solid funeral march-type-rhythm. The mounting paranoia is\naccentuated through the 'coming\ndown' delivery and the chant-like\nechoes of the chorus. The second\npart is still, in a way, dark and\ndirge-like but is musically more\nhopeful, as Even is told to give up\nhis 'unconditional love'. It sounds\nnot unlike a Nine Inch Nails slow\nnumber, really.\nKilling Some Dead Time is a great debut album that is in no way\nsame y. At various stages of listen-ing, 1 was reminded of Thorn Yorke,\nThe Smashing Pumpkins and Blur;\nthere was even a hint of the Stone\nRoses on the spaced-out Magic\nMushroom Night. My own personal favourite moment was the\ncroak y and laconic delivery of the\nsomewhat bizarre lyrics of the\ncreepy Strange News but this is a refreshing album that people are\nsure to find their own favourite\nmoments on. One press report\nstated that this was the only rock\nband to get excited about in 1998.\nThere's no doubt that that could be\nseen as corporate hyperbole but it\nshouldn't detract from the fact that\nthis is a fine first album, d Dennis\nPROPELLERHEADS\nDecksandDrumsandRockandRoll * * * *\nT he Propellerheads have\nbecome big cheeses now,\nand not only in the big beat\nworld. That much you can tell by\nthe people who want to work with\nthem: Shirley Bassey, David Arnold,\nAdidas... So successful was '97 for\nthe Props that they could even\nafford to refuse permission for their\nLethal Cut track to be used in a lucrative global ad campaign for\nCoca-Cola.\nIn all likelihood you will have\nheard their music, but do not be\nmislead into thinking that the\nalbum follows the same design as\nthe singles. In fact, some of the\nversions included are totally different to those previously released.\nMuch of the album is significantly\nharder than the music that brought\nthe band their fame; something to\nbe expected from a band who essentially make music to dance to.\nHowever, this does mean that it is\noccasionally difficult to sit and concentrate on the record throughout\nits duration.\nBut the club roots also provide\nthe Prop's strength; they know when to hold back on the beats and\nhow to create maximum effect\nwhen they are unleashed again. In\ninterviews, they have claimed that\nthat the album was built from the\nbeat up, a fact which is audible.\nHowever, the record is also permeated with funky tunes and amusing\nsamples. There is even (Oh Yeah?)\na bit of a rare groove influence in\nthere.\nFrom the title down, DecksandDrumsandRockandRoll is\ninfected with a humour that will\nkeep the listener entertained.\nSpecifically, A number of microphones shows that the band do not\nput themselves above including a bit of a joke on the album. For me\nthough, Velvet Pants is the outstanding track of the record. It is\nboth funky and groovy with cool\nvocals and an addictive bassline. In\nshort it is everything the Props\nwant to be and, at their best, are.\nEH Tom\n\n"

    "content": "20 February 1998\nCLUB SCENE COMPILATION MUSIC 17\nMURK.\nMIAMI DEER The ESSENTIAL MURK and FUNKY GREEN DOGS Mixes. (Harmless)\nMurk, hailing from Miami, are Oscar Ga eton and Ralph Falcon. Their individual style of melodic, deep rolling\nbeats combined with rumbling basslines and funky lyrics has been\ndescribed as 'bitter, twisted garage'.\nThis album from Harmless takes a definitive look at their story\nto date, combining the early mate-rial, such as Some Lovin by Liberty\nCity, to present day remixes and\nproductions. Miami Deep is unique\nin that it contains all of Murk's own material, including various remixes.\nIt is a two hour extravaganza and\ncomes as either a superbly packed\nclosed slip case double CD,a4 record un mixed set, or (did I draw\nthe short straw?!) a double cas-set te. Probably the best known and\narguably the most recent tune is\nthe first to be aired. Funky Green\nDogs' Fired Up sets the scene for a raw, floor-quaking house journey\nwhich expertly combines both the\nold and new.\nThis album is not on the same\nwavelength as many house compilations that have emerged in recent\ntimes. Murk's laid back, original,\nfunky grooves transcending\nbetween the hardest tracks, such\nas The Way from the Funky Green\nDogs, and the garage-ta stic and\nlyrical-loving, such as Oh Yeah by\nD.O.P., ooze a class not often\nfound.\nTape 1 concentrates on the\nmore house orientated side of\nthings. After Fired Up, we have\nclassics such as Donna Summer's State of Independence, along with\nKeep Pushin' by Boris Dlugosch\npresents Boom! Side B is a mix of\neight top quality tunes from Funky\nGreen Dogs including Liberty City's That's What I Cot. The mix shows\nhow accomplished the duo are in\nthe remixing stakes, with a Funky\nGreen mix of Miracle by Olive and a Funky Green dub of Jaydee's Plastic\nDreams.\nThe first hour passes quickly,\nwith the tape demanding to be put\non and played again. This temptation must be resisted (!) as we now\nenter a period in which a blend of\nRalph's disco background and Oscar's hip-hop roots take control.\nTape 2 contains the Liberty City\nclassic, If You Really Love\nSomeone. This is remembered more than anything for its stunning\nlyrical content. However, the style\nthen fades into something that can\nonly be described as having a very\nsame y feel to it.\nSide B of tape 2 is a pure\ngarage-cum-soul event from which\nI was not left begging for more.\nHowever, it would be too easy to\nbe critical without considering that\nall 27 tunes were either produced\nor remixed by Murk; an outstanding\nachievement in any producer's life-time, let alone in only 7 years.\nThe compilation is labelled 'The\nEssential Murk and Funky Green\nDogs Mixes'. On this I would agree,\nalthough at times an open mind is\nessential to fully appreciate the\nfuturistic, haunting and often\nrefined sound of Miami' s Murk.\nEE Chris.\nCLUB SCENE SINGLES Garage The Prisoners Of Technology (P.O.T)77 M Boogie (Fresh Kutts) 16th Feb.\nAnother fresh biscuit from P.O.T and much better than their last effort. This one seems to have\nmore depth to it. Totally rinsing bass-line. I don't know where they find them from; they\nmust have a secret stash of fat bass-lines\nsomewhere. Strong strings, kut t up beats and\nthen it drops in, massive track, once again\nblowing up clubs everywhere, one for the jump\nup crew.\nJohn B. Starburst / Slam Funk.\n(Formation Rec) 23rd Feb.\n2nd Album Sampler From Visions\nThe long awaited album Visions from John B looks as though it's almost here at last, aft et being delayed more times than a BR train.\nStarburst is a fast tempo, dark acid b line, sort\nof number that just seems to keep on building.\nSlam Funk starts off with stabs of flutes, double\nbass trumpets given in a jazz style, then in it\ndrops, in a jump up style, beats come in &. out,\nsquelch yb line. Two styles from what looks\nlikely to be a very impressive &. diverse album.\nLook out for review in coming weeks.\nCourtney Pine. Trying Times remix.\n(Talkin Loud) Out Now.\nPeshay starts off with long tight drum pattern\nthat breaks down into a full on trumpet jazz solo,\nalways on the edge of being overpowering, the\nbeats come back in stronger than before and the\ntrumpet plays second fiddle to the rolling breaks\nn' beats in a intelligent style. Roni Size gets on\nthe mix of Don't explain, and I was disappointed\nas I expected him to do a much harder re-work-ing, but instead goes for a laid back, even beat i ful roller. Exquisite lyrics and voice, but it could\nhave been so much more than just a nice tune.\nSadie Glutz. Strong Language EP.\n(Silver Planet) Out Soon.\n2 0 0 0 AD's club mix is a hard 'n' fast house\ntrack, driven by bass drums, strong keys and\na hypnotic array of atmospheric als. Sadie's mix is a more tr an cy affair.\nA excellent deep break-beat mix of Crazy\nSadie comes from Starecase, that builds nicely to end in a more standard house style. One for the DJ who likes to put some variation in\ntheir sets.\nGearwhore. The Passion EP.\n(Astralworks) Mid March.\nGearwhore come straight out of Chicago, the\nhome of house, and this latest release is in a deep house/techno style. Gearwhore is a truly\ndiverse producer and a master of all genres of\nelectronic music. This shines through in this\nlatest offering, with D& J5 break-beats creeping\nin here ' n' there and strong acid tendencies.\nAll this is kept at a steady pace with a hard\nedge to it. Dare I call this intelligent house\nmusic?\nMadley. Marakesh.\n(Bosca Beats) 2nd March.\nThis one starts off with bass-drum & bongo\nsetting the pace, fast 'n' furious. Tight percussion and a banging bassline soon join in to\ncreate a full on no messing banging house\ntrack. Flip-side is more minimal again banging\nbass-drum, bouncy b line and wig ge rly acid\nsounds, reminiscent of Jon The Dentist style.\nFlex kru. Watch the Flex\n(p hutu re trax) Mid March.\nThis one's been working it in the clubs, to great\nsuccess, for a while now and is being released\nwith 3 very impressive and different mixes. At\na push I'd have to say 1 favour Andy mow at s mix, which totally dispenses with the rag ga lyrics and loops Suzie Q's exquisite vocal \"Anit\ngot the love\" to great effect with funky stepping beats and bouncy sub-bass. This tune just\ngrows and grows on ya. Other mixes take it in\ndifferent directions; one in arag g arge style and\nthe other in a more deep dub by variation.\nPiece by Piece. Nobody's Business.\nDreem Teem Mixes. Early March\nYou get two mixes to choose from; one more\nvocal, the other less vocal, more club orientated with tuff er beats and fatter b line.This is\nanother quality Dreem Teem track (remix),\nusing a broken beat (2 step) sort of style.\nExcellent use of Piece by Piece vocal talents,\nstabs of this &. that and a humming bass-line,\nanother guaranteed floor filler.\nUnderground Solutions Feat. Colour Girl.\nTears (4 Liberty) Early March.\nThe debut release for Colour Girl on 4 Liberty\nrecords and is tipped by many for great things.\nI'm beginning to see why, as she has a distinctive voice and writes her own lyrics! Dreem\nTeem get on the mix here, and give it that two\nstep treatment, and deep sub-bass. However, I prefer Underground Solutions' dub mix. With\nstabs of the vocal keyboards working together and excellent chopped up beats and a dub by bassi in e you can't go wrong.\n|o Public.\n\n"

The first is to hunt me\ndown and listen to me rant on for\nhours about the shop, the label, the\nradio show, the club nights etc. If,\nhowever, this prospect for some\nreason sounds unappealing, I suppose you could join the fair sized\nqueue on Old Street to witness the\nwicked ones in action.\nI suppose it was inevitable that\nI was going to love this place. With\nthree floors of such high quality on\noffer you really could be spoilt for\nchoice. Ion the other hand had no\nsuch dilemma, knowing full well\nthat all my needs would be catered\nVery occasionally, I 'll get a CD sent through the post,\nand when1 look at it, it\nmeans nothing to me. Spiritual\nCleansing was like this, and I therefore expected little of it, only to be\nblown away by the sheer array of\ntalent and quality of music coming from this little known label.\nThis reinforces my opinion that\nthere is much quality music out\nthere going unnoticed, without the\nrecognition that it so rightly\ndeserves.\nClean Up records are the label\nthat discovered the highly successful Sneaker Pimps; Roll On, (fold\nmix) is featured on this compilation\nalong with a collection of limited\nedition vinyl releases from Clean\nUp since 93'. Iam glad to say that\nevery single track on here is packed\nfull of emotion and feeling, and all\nexhibit top class production.\nThe best way to describe this\nmusic is as an experimental, yet\naccessible, blend of eclectic styles\nincorporating hiphop' n' down beat; the sort of styles Patrick\nfor down in the basement.\nUp in Manchester there are a few tunes that are almost guaranteed to rock a crowd. An example\nof such a tune would be KR S ONE's Sound of da Police, another would\nbe Mr Scruff's Chicken in a Box. In\nmy time in London I had yet to hear\nthis latter tune being played in any\nclub, but barely had I even begun\nmy first drink in 333 when my ears\nwere filled with that familiar flute\nriff.\nI was not convinced that everyone in the place truly appreciated\nit, but when Mr Scruff himself\nstepped to the ones and twos I think they got the message. As he\neffortlessly fused all that is good in\nForge &. Giles Peterson champion\non Kiss 100 FM. I could go through trying to\ndescribe what each track sounds\nlike, but I won't. Let's just say that\nthis is probably the best selection,\nboth individually and as a whole, of\nthis type of music, that I 've ever\nheard. It is totally fresh; it would be\nso easy for these tracks to be bor-ing, and for each track to sound\nlike the one before, if not created\njust right. Each track, however,\ngrabs your attention with its own individual style and attributes; they\nall have their own distinctive feel &\nsound that differs from the rest.\nThey all have the same result - that\nof taking your mind far away, to the\ndistant realms of musical experience. For those of you who read my\nreviews regularly, you may have\nnoticed that I don't particularly like\nsongs with my electronic music,\nbut here most of the tracks have a fair sized lyrical content. I don't mind this at all, though, because\nthey all work so well. There are a vast range of vocal styles used,\nwith some of the most beautiful\nvoices you're likely to hear, just\nadding to the depth of the experience. Here the vocals are used as\npart of the sound, rather than for\ncommercial recognition and expectancy, as so many artists do.\nI can't big up this definitive collection of urban street sounds\nenough, so open your minds, open\nyour wallets and go ' n' buy it. del jo Public.\nthe world of music the time just\nflew by.\nTo all those wanting an overall\nreview of the club, I'm sorry. I only\nventured onto the other floors to\nget to the cloakroom, but the overall vibe seemed pretty much spot-on. I feel confident in wholeheartedly recommending the club to\nanyone who has a taste for beats\nand basslines, or is disillusioned\nwith the world of attitude-filled\nclubs.\nNow may I conclude by giving\nout my thanks to the ot gan is ers of\nthis night, for letting a sad old\nNortherner forget briefly that he\nwas in London?

The\nWinner gets free V. l.P entry to\nNo.4. Kingston, It's A London\nThing, Scott's exclusive London residence, on any Friday for themselves and3 friends, plus a copy of the album. Two runners up will get\ncopies of the album. All the\nwinner has to do is answer the\nquestion at the end of the review and take me with you!. Scott shot to fame, in the\ndance scene when his last vinyl\nrelease, It's A London Thing, a massive club tune, blew up and\nentered high in the national charts.\nWith so many mixed house ' n' garage CDs out at the moment,\nwhat make this one different, and\nworth buying? Well, the mixing\nsounds lively, and as if some effort's gone into it, which often\nisn't the case with these big name\nmixed compilations. Alos, the\nselection of tunes is slightly different to most of the albums already\nreleased.\nThe first half of the CD focuses\non what I would call a more classical garage style of music, but still\nfull of energy and big b lines, such\nas It's A London Thing, Timmi\nMagic' s Get Freaky, and tunes by\nBaffled &. Norris ' Da Boss'\nWindross to mention a few.\nThe second half focuses on the\nJUN GARAGE styles that are getting\nrinsed in the clubs, where jungle /\nD& J3 collides head on. Some of\nthese collisions produce some excellent tunes, most of which are\nfeatured here, for the first time\nshowing the jungle side of garage\nin full effect. Tunes such as\nKatrina's jah Rasta Pari (Dubplate\nstyle), KM A Production's Cape\nFear, Feel Real Good remix and\nDread Bass/ Devotion remix, highlighting the jun garage style.\nSo this is a more than adequate\ncollection of tracks, that should\ncater for the traditional garage\nclub ber as well as the new breed of\nold skool rave r/ jungle recruits.\nWith good mixing I'm glad to say,\nthis will make a welcome addition\nto any collection. FTTcl\nNow for the competition\nquestion, Who's the MC on\nScott's Garage hit It's A London\nThing, A.MC. Sharkey.\nB.MC. Styles\nC.M C.

    "content": "20 February 1998 NEWS\nArcher Aims at Mayorship\nDAVID ROBERTS\nDick Raynsford MP, Minister for\nLondon, and Lord Archer, former\ncabinet minister, spoke of their\nviews for the future of London\ngovernment at a debate organised by Con Soc and Lab Soc on\nWednesday. Both speakers advocated the proposed mayor for\nLondon, and urged those present\nto vote 'Yes\" to the Government's proposals, in the referendum to be\nheld on 7 May. Speaking first, Mr Raynsford\nnoted London' s place as the\nworld's only major capital city not\nto possess it's own city-wide gov-ern ment. Instead, strategic planning for the capital (transport, the\npolice, the environment etc) is con trolled by what he described as\n\"unelected, un-democratic, quan-gos\". Thus, as part of the\nGovernment's plans for devolution\nacross the country, \"It is necessary\nto create a new type of authority...\nwith a directly elected, fully\naccountable leader\". Alongside this\npresidential-style mayor, Mr Raynsford proposes an Assembly,\nelected from 72 constituencies,\nwho would act as a check on the\nMayor's actions. All this, he hopes,\nwill be in place in time for the first\nelections to take place in 2000.\nLord Archer of Weston-SuperM are admitted readily that he is\nalready beginning the campaign\nwhich he hopes will make him\nLondon' s first directly elected\nMayor. Speaking of his time working on the Greater London Council,\nhe explained that the new authority\nshould be far more effective thanks\nto it's streamlined approach. Where the GLC was all-powerful,\nemploying 17800 staff, the new\nAuthority will have specific, strategic powers and a maximum staff of\n250. Thus, whilst the new mayoral\nrole will be extremely hard work,\n\"There is the potential to get a phenomenal amount of work done\".\nLord Archer compared the new role\nwith that of Mayor Guiliani in New York, who \"makes mistakes, but\nmakes a lot of decisions and gets a huge amount done\". However, he\nrefused to be drawn on his policies\n\"I 've got a lot of ideas - you'll be\nblown away... but with two years to\ngo I'm not going to give away all\nmy secrets\".\nThe most surprising aspect of\nthe discussion was the level of\nagreement between the two speak-ers. Both Mr Raynsford and Lord\nArcher highlighted transport and\nthe disparity in the economy across\nthe capital as their primary goals\nfor the new Authority, and Lord\nArcher commented that \"Unless\nLabour or the Tories put up extremist candidates, 1 can't see there\nbeing many differences between\nthe two\". This provoked suggestions that the role would be more\nabout personality than politics, to\nwhich he readily agreed \"It needs to\nbe someone who can use the\npower, the tte men dous voice\nwhich being directly elected by five\nmillion people gives you\". However, he did point out that if he\nfailed to garner the official\nConservative candidacy, he would\nnot tun as an independent.\nThe only noticeable difference\nbetween the two candidates came\nover the form which the referendum itself should take. Mr Raynsford has forced through just a single question, as he believes that\n\"Two questions wouldn't cover\nevery option. The only other solution would be to have lots more\nquestions, to cover every pos sibi li ty, but then no option would get\nmajority backing\". Lord Archer,\nhowever, would prefer a second\nquestion on tax-raising powers, \"A' No' would force the Mayor to\ntightly control expenditure\". This,\nhe explained, would be important\nas the Government have stated\nthat there will be no increase in\nfunding for London. Both candidates urged everyone at IC to vote on 7 May on a decision which will mould the\nshape of London government for\nthe next millennia.\nULU May Sell Out to Take Pharaoh'\nDAVID ROBERTS\nFears for the future of the\nUniversity of London Union's sports ground at Motspur Park\nwere the primary\nconcern when ULU\nCouncil met this\nweek. Rumours have\nbeen flying for the\npast weeks, suggesting that UL U were\nplanning to sell-off\nthe ground to one of\nwest London's major\nfootball teams, with\nChelsea and Fulham\nthe prime targets.\nChelsea FC has\nrecently been purchased by a major\nproperty developer,\nwhile Fulham is\nowned by con travers i al Harrods tycoon,\nMohammed Al Fayed.\nThe ground, near Kingston, provides facilities for all of UL U's outdoor sport's teams, and includes a recently installed artificial hockey\nground, cricket, rugby and football\npitches, tennis courts and an athletics track. It is thought that it is\nthe presence of the artificial pitch\nwhich has triggered off interest\nGo on, Siva - you won't even have to pay the fu gg in' VAT\nfrom the millionaire owners of the\nclubs.\nMonday's meeting of UL U Council consequently moved to\nend concerns that the Union Management Committee, which consists of UL U's officers and\nsenior staff, might not secure a fair\nprice for the ground, which has\nbeen valued in the\nregion of one and a half million pounds.\nAccording to the\nUL U Constitution,\ndescribed by UL U President Siva\nGaneshanandan as\n\"written on the back\nof a bit of bog roll\",\nUM C are allowed to\nmake a decision on\nthis key issue without reference to\nUL U Council.\nConsequently, whilst accepting that negotiations\nshould be allowed\nto continue, the\nCouncil insisted that\nthe final decision on\nwhether or not to accept any offer\nshould be referred back to them, as\nthe sovereign body of UL U.

This was a nervous\nmoment but she placed the ball\nwith perfection, high in the top\ncorner.\nIn the end we lost 4-3 on\npenalties - a cruel way to leave the\ncup.\nICUWAFC 1 - I Kings\n(Lost 3 - 4 on penalties)\nResults\nHockey\nICU HC III 1 - 1 RS MIC UH C IV 0 - 1 UMD SR SM HC4 UCH II 1\nFootball\nICUWAFC 1 -1 Kings\nSaturday\nICUAFC III 3 - 1 ICAFC IV\nICUAFC V23 Royal Holloway\nWednesday ICUAFC II 2 - 1 UCL111 ICUAFC III 1 - 1 Wye ICUAFC IV 2 - 0 Charing Cross III\nICUAFC VI 2 - 4 Goldsmiths\nRugby\nICURFC I1138 DeMontfort\nICURFC 1\n1 31 - 5 Q MW II\nICUWRFC 0 - 1 1 Holloway\nHockey\nICUHC IV v UMDS\nLast week, ICU HC IV played\nUMD S at the Oval, Kennington.\nClearly outnumbered, we arrived\nwith only eight players so we\ndecided to concentrate on our\ndefence. We also got one player\nfrom our opponents who were one\ntoo many.\nIt soon became clear that we\nwere dominating most of the tack-les. Unfortunately, still lacking two\nplayers, we had to concentrate on\nshort passes for safety's sake, so\nthat most of our attacks came relatively slowly and were usually\nintercepted by hordes of opposing\ndefenders. After no more than ten\nminutes, UMD S scored. For the\nremainder of the match, our\ndefence allowed only two more\nshots at our goal. One of them\nmissed, the other was deflected by\njim.

On the\nmorning of Sunday 8 February our\nteam piled onto a minibus to meet\nHolloway Ladies Rugby team on\nthe field of play\nThe atmosphere was filled with\nnerves and excitement, however\nonce we arrived we settled into the\nserious task of warming-up, tap-ing-up and smearing various body\nparts with Vaseline.\nOnce the initial nerves were\nover we settled into a superb\nmatch of rugby. All that training\nand practice came in useful, Heads\nwere kept in the scrum and some\nbrilliant breaks were made by the\nvice-captain, Anna, playing No.8.We never lost moral what with\nMo and Jo yelling on the field and\nour \"trainer\" waving his can of John\nSmith's on the side lines, we had\nto enjoy ourselves.\nAmong our assets was the\nexcellent jumping by Kryzi (aided\nby the props) ensuring that we\nwon not only our own throw-ins\nHolloway's too. A mild lack of\naggression was soon over following the somewhat over exuberant\nslamming of Holloway's scrum-half into the posts by Mo in a failed\nattempt to prevent a try being\nscored.\nThe match ended on a high\nwith a marked improvement in\nplay for the Virgins. At the end of\nthe day we're all feeling pretty\nproud of ourselves for getting out\na team and giving Holloway a good match roll on the next challenge!\nICUWRFC 0 - 1 1 Royal Holloway\nBUS A Quarter finals.

The illiterates\nwere rattled resulting in a yellow\ncarding, but came back and scored but just before half time\nChris weaved his magic and we\nled 6 - 5 at the half.\nThe second half started explosively with those illiterates getting\na lucky push over try. Huge tackles were being made by everyone,\nespecially Lionel and Hu w. Then\nDave o dazzled everyone with a fantastic slight of hand and sliced\nthrough their defence, chipped, collected it and scored. By now the illiterates had enough and\nsubbed on6 ringers. The lads held\nout but the onslaught got the better of us and we gave away three\nsoft tries. Final score 38 - 11 but\nall the lads played like bastards\nand De Montfort are still wan kers.

    "content": "20 February 1998 COLUMNS\nTo quote a famous sage from the\nNorth, there's trouble at mill.\nThe student unions at IC, particularly but not exclusively, the CC Us appear to be in disarray. Now to\nanyone who has been here for a while, this may not come as a complete surprise. They have had a poorly defined role for as long as\n1 have been here, but lately they\nhave seemed to be become more\nirrelevant. My esteemed colleague\nHamish Common made some valid points about them last week,\nwhich I shall come to later. Stuart\nJenkins, on the hand, did not. To\ndescribe his contribution as a rant\nwould still imply more coherence\nthan was the case. His apparent\nilliteracy, which further undermines his pitifully weak case, may simply be due, however, to the difficulty of transcribing letters written in crayon. Of him, 1 shall say no\nmore.\nThe problems of the CC Us are\nmany, but one of the more major\nissues, as Hamish suggested, is\none of definition- what should they\nreally do? Some officers in these\norganisations have considerable\ndisdain for ICU and feel that they\ncan do it better. The newspapers\nare a classic example. For countless years, many Broadsheet staff\nhave had nothing but contempt for\nFelix, despite the paucity of their\nown efforts. 1 assume that such an\nattitude pervades the other pub li cations, but I can only speak from\nmy own experiences. Beyond sheer bloody-mindedness, I can\nsee little reason for the CC Us to\nlavish money on publications of\ndubious quality,\ntiny circulation\nand minuscule\nimpact; a rant\nabout College in\nBroadsheet carries as much weight as an\nopera review in\nExchange and Mart. The CC Us should concentrate on academic\naffairs, the odd bar night and maintain links with the alumni\nassociations. Beyond that, most of\ntheir current activities are inferior\nduplications of ICU. If the CC Us did not try to cast their net so widely, they would find themselves\nmuch more effective. ICU may also\nhave a stronger bargaining position\nwith College if money were not frittered away in such a manner.\nStranger things have happened.\n00\ncoL>0 The second problem is not\nmerely limited to the CC Us, but\naffects all the Unions at Imperial. It\nis also more serious. With the\nexception of the Sabbaticals,\nUnion officers and committee members are not paid. This creates a big difficulty, highlighted by\nShin Yi Jeng's excellent letter last\nweek. As the\nsalary bill is, in\nthese cases,\nzero, there is no financial need to\nkeep staff to a minimum. The\nresult is that all\nof these organisations are\nbursting at the\nseams with people doing jobs\n^ \"| that are at best\nquestionable and often, as Shin points out, highly counter-productive. The pathetic vacillation over which body should encompass his Anglo German Society shows beautifully\nhow overloaded our Unions are\nwith people that have far too much free time, far too great a love of\ntheir own voice and an obsession\nwith rules, regulations and committees that could teach the\nEuropean Community( or\nSherfield) a thing or two. The RCSU, for instance, currently has 25 officers, including\nPublicity Officer (Internal) and Publicity Officer (External). This\nmay simply be breathtaking hubris,\nbut serves to make it look ridiculous, clique y and distinctly unattractive to the majority of\nstudents. The behaviour of the\nOCS and CSC( apologies for all\nthese bloody acronyms) has been\npathetic. People forever moan about student apathy, yet when\nsomeone decides to do some-thing, he finds himself messed\nabout by two groups of self-opinionated pedants, doing their\ndamnedest to scupper his plans.\nOne expects shoddy treatment\nfrom some elements in Sherfield,\nbut when it comes from student\norganisations, it is totally outrageous. I would demand the resignation of those concerned, but\nthey would only be replaced by\nanother tranche of bureaucratic\nmuppets. [Easy tiger - Ed] Our Sabs have done a good job so far\nthis year. Why not end on a high by\nclearing out the forests of dead-wood in ICU's middle mis-management?\nmks. es. nts' at the end of it all disappearing into a hole, nothing more than a pawn for the to fund your ri Science is about wir j^e ip dre*i and excitement, understanding our world, manipulating and being controlled.
