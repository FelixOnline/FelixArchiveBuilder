    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198710 Just who is this David Jones chap? Known by millions\nas the man who brought homosexuality out of the\nImperial College closet and into our lecture theatres.\nMild-mannered or arrogant? Soft or stubborn? He is all\nthings to all people. Read on....\nJones came to Imperial four years ago\nto become a Mechanical Engineer.\nAfter his first year it was quite\napparent that this was something he\nwould never be able to achieve so he\ndecided to opt for a career in\njournalism instead.\nThe highlights of Jones' early life\nwere attending a wedding in\nOrpington at the age of 8 and scoring\na goal direct from a corner at the age\nof 11. At secondary level he made\nlittle mark and left with 12 O 'Levels\nand 4 A 'Levels (but one of those was\nGeneral Studies, so it doesn't count).\nJones was glad to see the back of\nCrewe as it contained memories of\nseveral disaster o us teenage love\naffairs.\nJones spent his first year in Evelyn\nGardens, gaining a reputation as a rebellious Socialist and as a drunkard.\nHe was only to finally settle down in\nhis second year, taking an active\ninterest in the College Dramatic\nSociety as actor extra ordinaire and\nholding the terribly important position\nof Fixtures Secretary for the ICU\nCricket Club. All his dramatic parts\nwere those of old men, due to his\nrugged features, deep, resonant voice\nand his receding hairline. A sort of\ncross between John Noakes of Blue\nPeter and Prince Charles.\nJones had been involved in FELIX\nas an occasional news reporter and\ngeneral dogs-body under Pallab\nGhosh and slightly more than that in\nDavid Rowe's year. The ne ext Editor,\nHugh Southey, was to offer him the\njob of Sports Editor (the naf fest job\nin FELIX) but Jones sniffed at this\nand offered himself as News Editor.\nHugh, who had already been turned\ndown by better men, could do nothing\nbut accept.\nThat year he gained the reputation\nfor being the miserable one who sat\nin the corner of the Office and told\npeople who wanted to use the\nphotocopier to 'piss off. He also\ndecided to run for Editor despite the\nstaff backing of the ever-popular\nNigel Atkinson. It was during this\nthird year at IC that he disappeared\nfrom the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment between Tuesdays and\nFridays to concentrate on news\ninvestigation and production. He was\nnow gaining mounting support from\nthe newer members of staff for his\nelection campaign due to his hard\nwork, easy manner and belief in\nFELIX and its ideals.\nWhilst Jones prepared to fight a bitter battle with ever-popular Nigel\nover the post of Editor, he was\nunaware that Nigel was to retire from\nthe race following 'a message from\nGod'. This left Jones fighting for an\nuncontested post, much to his\nannoyance as he was confident he\nwould have won the battle and felt\ncheated by Nigel's withdrawal.\nIt was around this time that College\nwas making overtures about taking\nover the old FELIX Office for\nBiology. Jones was vehemently\nopposed to the plans, which proposed\nthat the Office be moved to the\nopposite corner of Beit Quadrangle.\nHowever, College's carrot of \u00a335,000\nfor the purchase of a new litho and\ntypesetter was too much for the rest\nof the staff to resist and Hugh Southey\nfinally agreed to the move. This left\nJones with the une viable task of\nmoving during the first few months\nof his term as Editor. As well as this\nboth the permanent staff decided to\nleave.\nBy some miracle Jones managed to\nobtain a pass degree that Summer,\nand sulked because he wanted a third.\nThe rest of the staff, however,\nsecretly breathed a sigh of relief as\nthey all thought he was going to fail\nand had formulated 'Plan B' to cover\nsuch an eventuality.\nIt was during his first few weeks\nthat the staff realised just what sort\nof Editor Jones was to be. Miserable\nand mixed up. It took him four weeks\nto bring out an 8 page FELIX, and\nthey still had to collate at six on the\nFriday morning. He was soon to\nexhibit his infamous talent for\ncreating four page lists of work to be\ndone and adding more to them than\nhe took off. The staff were also aware\nof his staggering body odour\nproblems, brought on by his\nreluctance to stop wearing the same\nclothes day after day after day after\nweek. The problem became so bad\nthat a motion was passed at a Publications Board meeting that any\nold clothes that members had should\nbe donated to a special David Jones\nFund.\nDuring the Autumn Term chaos\nreigned as new staff were found and\ntrained. Also, the new Office took\nmuch longer to finish than\nanticipated. No edition of FELIX was\nfinished before Bar closing time and\nJones spent many nights catching two\nhours sleep in the Editor's Office.\nJones showed us all his famous\nstamina when producing the\nChristmas Issue. He spent over 50\nhours without sleep, only to collapse\ninto an exhausted heap on the Print\nRoom floor when the printing had\nbeen finished. This was not well-received by the col later s as it was 5\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nThe sign of a misspent youth\nNearly four years ago I arrived at Imperial\nCollege to read Mechanical Engineering, but\nwithout any real intention of pursuing an\nengineering career. Three years later, after\ndrifting aimlessly through the last eighteen\nmonths of a three year course, I was quite\nrelieved to pick up a lousy degree result and be\nof \"good academic standing\", and therefore able\nto take up a sabbatical post. Over the last few\ndays I have looked back at all this year's issues\nof FELIX, and to be honest I found most of them\nrather tame. On occasion FELIX has attacked\nCollege administration for dragging its feet over\nthe accommodation issue and focussed more\nattention on the poor teaching standards in\nCollege, but there has not been much to reflect\nthe rather desolate experience that I remember\nfrom the previous three years.\nLike many students who came to Imperial, I was attracted by the College's world-wide\nreputation. I remember particularly the advice\nof several friends over forty years of age, mostly\nfrom the teaching profession, who all enthused\nat length on the merits of Imperial College. Now,\nafter following their advice, there is no way that\nI would recommend IC to any prospective\nuniversity entrant. In fact, I think I would go\nfurther and actively discourage any sixth former\nwho was considering applying.\nI wouldn't write this if it were based on my\nown experiences only, as I have to confess I was\na lousy student. The majority of the students who\ntook the course with me were of a similar mind;\nthe number of graduates opting for careers in\naccountancy and similar professions is a joke at\nImperial College, but it is a measure of how\ncompletely their time at College drained them\nof the enthusiasm which they (mostly) started out\nwith.\nThe biggest barrier to effective undergraduate\nteaching is not the lack of an ability to teach,\nin terms of \"communication skills\", etc. What\ndestroys the enthusiasm of students is the almost\ntotal lack of concern which some departments,\nnot just Mechanical Engineering, have for their\nstudents. I know several people who have been\nthrough a degree course at Imperial College and\nonly spoken to their personal tutor on two or\nthree occasions. Certainly, the onus is on the\nstudent to seek help when he needs it, but this\ndoes not absolve academic staff from the duty\nto supervise.\nOver the past few weeks I have seen several\nsenior academics react in a very paranoid manner\nto any hint of bad publicity for the College, either\nin FELIX or elsewhere. The letter which a group\nof postgraduates sent to me before Easter is a prime example. Though I understand that there\nare a number of Civ Eng staff who were\ngenuinely upset, I also know some students from\nthat department who thought that it was fair\ncomment. The College's recruitment\npublications are another issue. The Imperial\nCollege prospectus, like most university\nprospectuses for that matter, paints so rosy a picture that it is hard to reconcile with the grim\nreality. I would not expect the College to produce\nanything else, but for the administration to be\nupset that the Union media are giving a fairer\npicture is absurd. It appears that a proportion of\nall the Governing Body gave the letter from our\ngroup of postgraduates no c rede ance at all. This\nis a pity, because letters of that sort are going\nto become more frequent rather than less.\nThough eyes are constantly being opened to\nthe teaching standards problem, it is difficult to\nsee how any major advances can be achieved in\nthe current climate. There are few people in this\nCollege who seem to be full of hope for the\nfuture, and when the College as a whole is\nfeeling the pinch (or, as the Rector would put\nit, \"we're broke\") there's not much chance for\nimmediate progress. Yesterday's meeting of ICU\nCouncil noted that student representation on\nCollege committees was becoming less and less\neffective, as decision making was in reality,\nbeing moved away from the committee level and\nentrusted more and more to central College\nadministration. Imperial is concentrating on\nsurvival, and the needs of \"Joe Student\" are an\ninsignificant consideration.\nFELIX, Wednesday June24 th19872 Ring in the new\nHistory would seem to suggest that FELIX has\nits most memorable years when the Union is\nweakest, or at least when the sabbaticals are a bad crop. Put another way, a decent set of\nsabbaticals is a curse upon the FELIX Editor.\nThough I have probably missed opportunities to\ncriticise the running of the Union this year, it\nis certainly true that the Union leadership has\nbeen as successful as any other in recent years.\nThe Union sabbaticals still seem rather remote\nto most students, however, and I do not believe\nthat this has changed much this year. There have\nbeen several new initiatives which have deserved\nwider support, and we seem to be facing up to\nthe usual financial constraints with a little more\ncalm than has been usual. In a sense it is an\nindication of failure for the Union President to\nreport that \"the relationship between FELLX and\nthe Union central has been excellent this year\",\nand I would not ideally have chosen to adopt such\na united front with the Union Office. On the\nmajor issues however, the Exec have had my\nvehement support, and if FELIX has lacked an\nanti-establishment approach, then it is too bad.\nI would have much preferred to have been either\nlast year's or next year's Editor.\nOn the more general question of the role of\nFELLX, I am beginning to change my view quite\nradically. I have tried to make FELIX as much\nof a \"normal\" newspaper as possible; if I was\nto go back to the start of last July I would put\nmuch more effort into providing an entertaining\nFELIX. That said, I am really rather proud of\nthis issue. 40 pages is probably a contender for\nthe biggest FELIX ever\u2014I hope it makes up for\nall the thin ones we have been producing\nrecently.\nOne more cup of coffee...\nThe annual lament of the outgoing FELLX Editor\nis that he/she feels they have hardly started, and\nhave just about managed to get to grips with the\njob. The turmoil which the office was in at the\nstart of the year has made me regret the rapid\npassing of twelve months even more than usual.\nI still have a folder full of good ideas; projects\nwhich were forever being put off 'till the\nweekend. For all that it has been tremendously\nenjoyable to bring out FELIX, and, for all the\ndisappointment, I am sure I would choose to do\nit again.\nDavid Jones\n\n"

Harold Larwood (later of the infamous 'BodyMae' series)\nwas driving through Staffordshire with another member of\nthe 1932 Nottinghamshire side. It was a Sunday afternoon,\nso neither of them were too surprised when they happened\nupon a village cricket match and, being true Englishmen\nand true cricketers, they decided to stop for half an hour\nto watch the game. The home team, they gathered from\nan aged spectator, hud won the toss and were about to\nstart their innings. As the other side took the field, the\nopposing captain noticed the two figures watching from\nthe boundary and hurried over to them. He explained that\nhis team were one man short and, not having recognised\neither Larwood or his colleague (this was 1932.\nremember) asked if either of them would like a game of\ncricket. After some hesitation, Larwood admitted to having\n\"played a little\" and volunteered to make up the numbers\nfor the away team. He was given some third hand whites\nfrom the pa villi on and despatched to long leg to field.\nThe home side's opening batsmen were in good form,\nand after an hour and a half they had put on 135 without\neven offering chance. The captain of the fielding side had\ntried all his bowlers, but none of them had caused the\nbatsmen any trouble. In desperation the captain approached\nLarwood, t Ji in king that some fourth rate bowling might\ntempt the batsmen into giving a chance, and asked if he\nwould like to try an over. Larwood rather sheepishly\nagreed, took the ball, and, set the field for an off spin attack. From a three pace run up he moved gracefully\ntowards the popping crease and delivered a perfect off-break: the ball pitched on a length, just outside the off\nstump, and cut back in, trapping the batsmen Jbw right in\nfront of the stumps.\nLarwood, forgetting briefly that he was not playing in a first class match, turned back to the umpire and yelled\n\"Owzat?!?\" at the top of his voice. The umpire, not\nfalling into the trap of being impartial (he was also the\ngroundsman) kept his hands in his pockets and remained\nsilent. With a little more malice in his stride, Larwood\nwent back to his mark, and from another three paces\nbowled a beautiful leg-break: the ball pitched in front of\nthe stumps, drew the batsman forward, took the outside\nedge and went straight into the keeper's gloves.\n\"Owzat?\", demanded Larwood and the rest of the\nfielders. \"Not out\" replied the umpire. Larwood, after a venomous look at the umpire, calmly paced out his full\nrun up of 35 yards, which took him to the steps of the\npa villi on. The fielders scattered as Larwood thundered in\ntowards the wicket and delivered a full length ball at his\nnorma! pace (about 94mph). The batsmen never saw\nLarwood's arm, yet alone the ball, which took all three\nstumps out of the ground and knocked one of the bails\no yer the boundary.\nLarwood admired his work for a few moments, turned\neo i eij fej fp the umpire, and remarked: \" Aye well, we bloody\na eW i^ had him that time, didn't we?\"\n\n"

FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198715 the College Secretary, to the\ndetriment of almost everyone in\nCollege: the Union lost money and\nspace, and the staff lost the only place\nin College where they could get away\nfrom all the students for an hour. On\nthe last Tuesday of the Autumn term\nthe Rector, and John Smith, called a meeting which was packed out with\nhostile academics, where Mr Smith\ngave a long presentation showing how\nthe refectory system had developed\nand how it stood today; facts which\ncould be found out by the simple\nprocess of having lunch. (Is this the\nfirst FELIX news round-up that\ndoesn't mention Victor Mooney?)\nThe audience was so hostile that at\none stage it looked as though Mr Smith himself might end up on the\nmenu of an impromptu staff\nbarbeque.\nAn emergency U GM voted by an\neasy majority to boycott the QT snack\nbar, until College started to admit that\nthe Union was being diddled out of\ncash and space. Surprisingly the\nboycott worked, despite the\ncarniv our o us cravings of many\nstudents who were forced to forgo\ntheir daily dose of animal flesh by\neating 'tofu' (which is made from old\ncopies of the Guardian, incidentally)\netc, at the ideologically sound Union\nSnack Bar instead of revelling in the\ntaste of animal flesh at QT. Only a few people crossed the picket lines,\nand the snack bar was shut in two\ndays. Negotiations started in earnest,\nand the boycott was called off: a complete success. Meanwhile, the\nRector started to investigate plans for\nsetting up a field station in Siberia\n(Deputy Head of Cleaning Services:\nMr J Smith).\nThe University of London Union\nwas also having its problems. They\nwere threatened with a massive cut in\nfunding by the UGC, which would\nbasically force it to shut, despite the\nfact that it provides a very useful\nfacility for somewhere in the region\nof 40,000 students. They too started\na campaign, but as there was no food\ninvolved the response from IC was\nless impressive. A few crackpots held\na 'pram race', although the 'pram s' turned out to come from those well-known Mothercare rivals, Waitrose,\nSainsburys and Safeways. Whether\nthe IC contribution helped the\ncampaign or not we shall never know,\nbut thankfully the UGC relented and\nthe cuts never took place.\nThe year's successes include Rag,\nwith Tiddleywinks raising over \u00a33000\nand Monopoly raising \u00a32400, and for\nthis the Rag Chairman, Man Tai,\nmust receive some congratulation.\nThe Phoenix, the IC literary\nmagazine, managed to reach its\ncentenary, despite the many\nprophecies of its demise, and there\nwas a week of events to celebrate this.\nThe Boat club also had success. With\nBoat Club around, IC Union will\nnever be taken over by red activists,\nbecause within two months it will\nbleed the Union white again.\nFailures include the morons who\npoured scorn on the concept of lesbian\nand gay rights, and the Labour Party.\nIt is the end of term. In a few days\nthe undergraduates will start leaving\nCollege. The staff and PGs can get\nback to doing some work, while the\nundergraduates move away: some\nleaving for three months, some for a lifetime. The dream is over, and\nreality beckons. Some things will be\nthe same next year and every year.\nNext year's grant will be 3.75%\nhigher, so once again it will be\ninadequate.

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Wednesday June 24th19879 the working day. I think it would be a disaster as there is a very obvious limit\nto how useful you can be in a day.\nI think the idea of lack of lecture space\nis somewhat exaggerated. The UGC\n\u2022 (University Grants Committee) say we\nhave too much of it! We have to start\nlooking at ways of utilising it more\nefficiently. I think it could be less of an\nissue than people think.\nEric Ash doesn't think very much of\nanonymous letters in FELIX, like the\nCivil Engineers' letter. He called them\n'diabolical'. Do you share his view?\nI think that's total crap and I think that\nFELIX should go on printing\nanonymous letters when it's necessary.\nIt's very easy for someone in Eric Ash's position, or even my position, to say\nanonymous letters are a bad thing\nbecause we've got nothing to lose. But\nfor somebody who is already feeling that\nthey are having a hard time in their\ndepartment, there's no way that they are\ngoing to write to FELIX saying 'my\nsupervise r is a heap of..whatever' and\nthen stick their name at the end of it. I think it's quite right that people should\nbe able to put their views out publicly\nbut remain anonymous.\nIt did seem to cause an awful lot of\nembarrassment to the Civil\nEngineering Department.\nIt did, and I'd like to think that we\nwere instrumental in that. The day it\ncame out there was a meeting of the\nGoverning Body (the House of Lords of\nImperial College) Dave Colley (ICU\nHon Sec) and I had been reading this\nletter and decided that maybe we ought\nto bring it to everybody's attention.\nDave went out and brought back about\n40 copies and told them to read the\nletter. This caused absolute uproar but\nI'm glad we did it. Certainly, some of\nthe people who read it were absolutely\nhorrified. Quite a few dismissed it out\nof hand but some of the ones who didn't were quite important people. For\ninstance, the Government's Education\nDepartment Representative was\nhorrified by it and took people to task\nabout it.\nOne of the complaints many people\nhave voiced about the Union recently\nhas been that there was no Union fight\nover the massive rent increases facing\nstudents living in College\nac como dati on next year due to the\npurchase of the new houses in Evelyn\nGardens.\nI realise that people think we've done\nthem badly wrong. It's a very difficult\nquestion and it's one that I tried to bring\nto light several times. No doubt I didn't try hard enough to get a proper reaction\nabout it but there isn't an awful lot else\nwe can do about it. I think that the\nCollege will probably be forced to find\nthe money from somewhere else. But if\nthe money couldn't have been found we\nwould have come to a situation next year\nwhere the College couldn't have housed\nall the people it promised to. A property\ncame onto the market which was really\na once in a lifetime opportunity. Most\npeople agreed they were houses that had\nto be bought. The money had to be\nfound from somewhere. I must add that\nI am not happy about the rent increases,\nbut we have to be realistic to a certain\nextent. I know that I probably sound like\nthe opposition speaking. Property prices\nin London are such that to retain a differential that large between what the\nCollege provides and what the private\nsector provides is just not feasible.\nThat's something which is going to\nbecome more apparent as student-type\nCommittee Chairman expressed\nconcern that overseas students seemed\nprimarily to be viewed as just a source\nof income.\nThis is a huge problem, and a lot of\npeople within College do see overseas\nstudents in that light. I think that's one\nof the points that the Union is going to\nhave to work very hard on in the future\nto make sure that anything that can be\ndone to lessen that effect and to make\nlife better for overseas students is done.\nThere's also the prospect of student\nloans.\nUnder the present system most people\noperate their own student loan anyway!\nI think if it can be done formally with\naccommodation in London becomes\nmore and more difficult to find. The\nincreases are very unfortunate for those\nwho have to live in College\naccommodation next year, but looking\nfive years hence there was absolutely\nnothing else that could be done. But I do feel that there are enough strong-minded, strong-willed people to ensure\nthat if money does become available\nfrom any other source it will be used to\npay off that loan and decrease the burden\non students.\nYou mentioned the difficulties of\nraising money. I gather that the\nCollege is doing this by increasing the\nnumber of overseas students in every\ndepartment. The Overseas Students\na low interest rate and a long pay back\nperiod then it's the best we can hope to\nget out of this Government.\nI do believe that education should be\nfree. I think that a mandatory grant is\nthe only way to do that, but we're never\ngoing to get that under the Conservative\nGovernment. Top up loans are probably\nthe next best thing. I certainly would\nhave got one rather than having to rely\nheavily on my parents.\nBanks are invidious to start off with.\nI find the whole thing quite a palling. I remember Nat West coming over and\nrubbing their hands over us all the time.\nThey will do anything, literally\nanything, to get their hands on students'\nbank accounts basically. I could not\nbelieve how much money the banks are\nwilling to put forward to have a stall here\nin the hopes of catching a few students\nand getting their grant in their account.\nWho has been the least helpful College\nofficial that you have encountered this\nyear?\nThat is a very difficult one to answer.\nThe most obvious one to say is Michael\nArthur, isn't it. Everybody wants me to\nsay Michael Arthur and to be quite\nhonest he has wound me up more often\nthan any other College official.\nSometimes he's been quite reasonable\nand quite helpful, though, which is why\nI can't actually say that it was Michael!\nI honestly don't think he is quite a bad\nas he is made out to be. But I 've\ncertainly sworn more at him than an\nother College official.\nTo a certain extent you have to play\nthe game a bit and you have to be\nprepared to...well if other people are\ngoing to be a bit devious, you have to\nbe a bit devious with them. You can't afford to be too upset about that. I find\nit quite possible to work with most\npeople in College, although there have\nbeen times\u2014the JCR thing was a classic\nexample. All the people involved just\nseemed selectively deaf to everything we\nwere saying and attempted to confuse the\nissues everytime we tried to put them\nforward. It's not just one person, more\nthe way the administration is set up\nwhich is frustrating and the number of\ndifferent committees; anyone you try to\npin down can pass the buck. If someone\ndoesn't like what you're trying to talk\nabout, they can quite easily refer it to\nanother body or another person and just\nkeep you running about in small circles\nfor a long time. I think that's something\nthat the College itself suffers from. It's very inefficient and very slow. My\nadvice to anybody who's in this place\nis to go straight for the person most\nlikely to be in charge of the subject and\ntry and bypass as many other committees\nas possible.\nSo do you have any advice for next\nyear's President, Ian Howgate?\nKeep calm! Try and get lots of sleep.\n' Don't fly off the handle when you think\nsomething's going wrong because,\nunfortunate as it seems, if you give\nyourself a reputation as somebody who's slightly hysterical people will never take '\nyou seriously.\nDo you have any political ambitions?\nOf course I do! But you don't just go\nlaunching into something like that next\nyear. I 've got very strong political\nambitions. Eventually I want to go into\nteaching at secondary school level.\nEverything in the education system is\nvery, very depressing. From my point\nof view anyway. You need teachers who\ncan inspire and you need teachers who\ncan really put something across and\nthat's what I want to do eventually.\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198735 Soup opera\nMost people should by now have heard of the Soup\nRun. The actual experience, though, is more than the\nsimple dishing-out of soup that it sounds like. Kamala\nSen reports.\nThe evening starts innocuously\nenough, at 9.15 in the Weeks Hall\nBasement, with a handful of people\nloading the van with the urns of soup\nand sweet milky tea, loaves of\nbread\u2014both white and brown\u2014and\ndigestive biscuits. Even the slightly\nmanic drive through London is\nnormal by College standards. The\nfirst note of strangeness appears when\nthe regular \"Soup Runners\" give\nbeginners the introductory speech.\nMost of this is straightforward.\nUnlike the food and tea, which is\nfreely distributed, the few blankets\nare given only to those who\nspecifically ask for- one. You're\nwarned not to wander off on your\nown, or to tell anyone your name and\naddress\u2014Soup Runners have had\ntrouble with people camping on their\ndoorsteps. And the final word of\nadvice\u2014if a fight starts, stay clear and\nget in the van; the Soup Runners\naren't going to stay around. This\nspeech gives one something to think\nabout until at last the van grinds to\na halt at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and\ndumps everyone into a completely\ndifferent world\u2014that of London's down-and-outs.\nAfter the brightness of the streets,\nthe pitch blackness here is an\nunpleasant surprise. Even when your\neyes adjust, there's nothing to see but\ndark blurs against a dark background.\nAs soon as the van stops, shadows\nswarm around it\u2014the Soup Run is\nexpected. There are about 30 people\nhere, many of whom are regulars;\nsome claim to have lived here for as\nlong as seven to nine years. Most of\nthe Soup Runners and down-and-outs\nrecognise each other\u2014and their\nfoibles. For example there's the man\nwith a craving for biscuits, stalking\nanyone with a pack. In another corner\nthere's an informed discussion on\nearly British cars and motorcycles\ngoing on. The whole affair seems\nslightly unreal, like hosting a very\npolite tea party in a parking lot, except\nfo- the occasional bout of coughing\nbreaking into the conversation. But\nthe illusion is well and truly shattered\nwhen one takes cups of tea into the\nshelter. The floor is packed with\npeople sleeping in elaborate\narrangements of cardboard boxes.\nThe more experienced Soup Runners\nassure me that these are sophisticated\nstructures, with flaps cut to form\ncomplex ventilation systems. Still, the\nsight suddenly brings home to me\nhow little these people have.\nThe next stop is a completely\ndifferent place: Embankment.\nRelatively brightly lit, and infinitely\nmore noisy, with the trains running\noverhead every few minutes, this is\na favourite stop for numerous\ncharities. Indeed, the down-and-outs\nwho sleep under the bridge here are\nsaid to receive several meals a day\nfrom various sources. The atmosphere is somehow rougher; the\nrange of people seems wider. There\nare-, the quiet ones, like a former\nelectrical engineer who sat working\nhis way through a stack of paperback\nwesterns\u2014his family had been killed\nin an accident and he didn't see the\npoint of struggling on in\n\"respectability\" on his pension. The\ncardboard boxes are as much in\nevidence here, but the structures are\nsimpler. Some people have sleeping\nbags\u2014American Army ones are said\nto be barely adequate!\nThere are some startling views to\nbe heard. One man perked up when\nhe heard I am German. Hitler, he\nsaid, was one of the greatest heroes\nof his time. After all, didn't he create\njobs for thousands? Certainly he did\nmore good than harm. And, cheered\nup by this little argument, he gave me\none of his \"heat packs\"\u2014a device\nwhich when rubbed gives off a mild\nheat for several hours (though not as\nlong as claimed by the manufacturers). Others recognised the pack\nand greeted it with enthusiasm when\nthe blankets ran out. Not surprisingly,\nMrs Thatcher is not a popular figure\nin these circles. \"What she wants is\nto put us all into forced labour\ncamps\", said one man.\nEqually startling statements appear\nin general conversation. The \"professor\" held us spellbound while\nhe explained how plutonium is\nformed by the fermentation of oil,\nwhich in turn develops, via the\nfermentation of coal, from dead trees.\nSomewhat rotund, he waved away\noffers of biscuits, indicating he was\nwatching his figure. But he was more\nthan happy to carry on talking about\nanything, including his views on\nmarriage. These were rather old fashioned \u2014that the man should work\nand the woman should look after\nhim\u2014but that didn't stop him\nproposing to all us prospective\nprofessionals on the Soup Run.\nThe reasons people wind up\nsleeping at Embankment are as varied\nas their characters. One was a psychiatric nurse who lost his job in\nIreland due to alcoholism, but says he\nis now cured and hopes to get his job\nback. Then there was the woman who\nhad been raped, and never recovered\nfrom the experience. The smell of\nalcohol hanging in the air over some\nareas suggested a reason for those\npeople's presence. Several people\nlimped heavily; sickness is, not\nunexpectedly, common. Coughs are\nheard all over; on one occasion we\narrived to find a couple of police\nofficers hovering anxiously over a huddled figure. Then there was a worrying case of the young man who\nwas confused and dizzy, but refused\nmedical help. Incidents like this make\nfor an anxious evening, as do those\noccasions when someone becomes\nunpleasantly aggressive. The Soup\nRun isn't all sweetness and light and\ngrateful recipients of our\n\"goodies\"\u2014there are those who are\nobviously hostile or merely silent and\nunresponsive; perhaps they've had an\noverdose of charity, an\nunderstandable point of view. But\nwhat makes it worth trying is talking\nto people who seem to enjoy the\nconversation and attention, and\nsupplying some comfort to those who\ncome back again and again for the\nsoup and biscuits.\nAt about eleven o 'clock we were on\nour way back. Besides mulling over\nthe events of the evening, I spent the\ntime asking my companions how and\nwhy they'd joined the \"Soup Run\". Most had heard about it from friends,\nmany of them in the Christian Union.\nThis probably accounts for the image\nof IC Community Action Group as a Christian organisation, but religion\ndoesn't come into the dic us sion at all,\nso don't let that put you off. If the\nSoup Run doesn't appeal, ICCA G organises other activities such as\ndoing odd jobs or visiting the elderly.\nIts main problem seems to be a lack\nof active members\u2014last year it had\na mailing list of about a hundred, of\nwhich only a dozen or so people\nregularly helped.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Wednesday June24 th19876 Israel: Operation for Peace\nDear Dave,\nI feel it is most important to correct\nthe inaccurate and misleading remarks\nof last week's 'Opinion'. The author\nof the article began with the premise\nthat the State of Israel has no right to\nexist, and developed from that\nposition a twisted and distorted\nargument.\nLet me first consider the necessity\nfor Operation Peace for Galilee. This\nwas a response to fourteen years of\nPLO terrorist warfare launched\nagainst the northern settlements in\nIsrael such as Kiryat Shmoneh. The\n7,000 PLO terrorists were well\ntrained and highly armed with\npowerful weaponry from all over the\nworld, including BM21 rocket\nlaunchers capable of firing 40 rockets\nsimultaneously with a range of 22km. On July 15th1981 a systematic\nrocket and artillery barrage of\nnorthern Galilee began. In order to\nprotect its citizens, Israel mounted\nOperation Peace for Galilee on June\n6th1982. No country except Israel\nhas ever taken so many precautions\nto avoid civilian casualties. Israel\nprovided medical aid to Lebanese\ncivilians which cost $40,000 per day\nand included flying patients with\nkidney disease to the Haifa Carmel\nHospital. Indeed the figure quoted in\nthe article of 50,000 casualties in\n1982 is totally meaningless. Since the\nnumber of Lebanese civilian\ncasualties was of the order of 1,000,\nI presume the 50,000 is a very\nconservative estimate for the number\nkilled in the Lebanese civil war from\n1975 onwards.\nNow I should like to describe the\nactual situation in Judea and Samaria,\nwhich has recently been coined the\nWest Bank. In discussing Bir Zeit and\nother universities, the author has\nconveniently forgotten that until 1967\nJordan had forbidden the\nestablishment of any universities. The\nIsraeli Government, however, has\npermitted not only Bir Zeit and Beith\nLahem, but three others to be built.\nFar from restraining civil liberties the\ncivilian administration has been\ndeveloped. It now numbers 17,000 of\nwhom 98% are Arab residents. Israel\nhas invested heavily in water\nresources, living conditions, and\nhealth facilities. The life expectancy\nhas risen from 48 to 62 years, infant\nmortality is now one quarter of the\n1967 level. The Jewish settlement in\nJudea and Samaria is only an issue\nbecause the State of Israel is at issue.\nThe Jewish population is less than 4%\nof the total and owns just 60,000 out\nof 1.5 million acres. Arab settlers\nhave successfully won land disputes\nin the Israel Supreme Court.\nThe figure of 4 million refugees is\nagain an ex age ration. There are\n1,800,000 Palestinians registered as\nrefugees, of whom only about\n625,000 live in camps. Yet even those\nin camps, according to UNRWA\ndoctors, have low levels of\nmalnutrition and high levels of\nliteracy. These Arabs share a common language and culture with\nthe citizens of the Arab states.\nHowever, their refugee status has\nbeen calculated ly maintained to serve\nthese countries' political aims. The\nJordanian daily newspaper Falastin\nstated, in 1949, that \"The Arab states\nwhich had encouraged the Palestine\nArabs to leave their homes\ntemporarily, in order to be out of the\nway of the Arab invasion armies,\nhave failed to keep their promise to\nhelp these refugees.\"\nIsrael is a peace-loving democratic\ncountry; helping the Arab refugees\nmore than their own countries have,\nshe demands no more than the right\nto exist. This is the truth.\nYours sincerely,\nNeville Nelkon, Computing I The President talks bollocks\nDear Dave,\nI have just returned from abroad,\nto receive a copy of FELIX and read\nthe opinion article by Al Roberts (Doc\n1).\nAl seems to have some strange idea\nthat I was trying to insult him in my\nlast letter, when I referred to AIDS\nin the same sentence as\nhomosexuality.\nI must agree whole hearted ly with\nmany of the statements in his article\nas they are identical to those\nmentioned in my previous letter. At\nthe same time I must point out that,\nbeing homosexual, he must come to\nterms with the fact that AIDS will\nhave a large effect on his life.\nHe claims that promiscuity is a problem of heterosexuality; this I must disagree with. He goes further,\nto suggest that I am promiscuous and\nsex-starved. Well, I have to say that\nI am neither, and how he might know\nany different I would be interested to\nhear.\nIn his article he states that 60% of\ngay men have sex with 0 or 1 person\na month and that only 2 % ' 'make it\"\nwith between 11 and 20 people a month. This presumably leaves 38%\nwho \"make it\" with 2 to 10 people.\nSome of these people are sleeping\nwith more people in a month than I have in my entire life. I fail to see how\nthis cannot be promiscuous.\nI estimate from his figures that 30%\nof gay men have sex with 1 person\na month and note that 40% of all gay\nmen are promiscuous (ie have sex\nwith 2 or more people a month; my\npersonal definition). From these facts\nit can be estimated that around 10%\nof gay men are having sex once a month with a promiscuous person. As\na result it will take less than 12\nmonths for nearly every gay person\nto have had sex with a promiscuous\nperson. Taking this into account any\ngay person, who is not celibate or\ndevoted to an AIDS free partner who\nis devoted to him, must take AIDS as\na serious threat.\nWhether Mr Roberts believes it or\nnot, I take AIDS very seriously. My\nsecond-to-last relationship was last\nsummer in Africa, this put me in a very low risk group, but none-the-less\na risk group. As a result I have had\nan AIDS test this year. I feel that\neveryone is obliged to go and request\nan AIDS test, it's not a lot of fun\nsitting and waiting for your results,\nnot knowing if you are going to live\nor die; but at the end of it you know\nthat you are not going to kill the next\nperson you make love to.\nIf members of Gay Soc are not\nwilling to take the threat of AIDS\nseriously then the society itself\nbecomes a health hazard to its\nmembers and its existance needs\ncareful examination.\nMr Roberts' article has made me\nreconsider my viewpoint on the Gay\nSoc. I shall without a doubt be having\nfurther in depth conversations with\nAndy Bannister about the matter,\nmaybe so should you, Mr Roberts.\nYours,\nIan Howgate.\nN.B. For information on the sexual\nactivity, or lack of it, of IC students,\nI suggest we all watch these pages for\nthe imminent Welfare Questionnaire\nresults.\nDear Dave,\nAlthough Ian's interpretation ofthe\nfigures given by Al Roberts could be\njustified, bear in mind that such\nsurveys by low-circulation papers\nsuch as Capital Gay are actually very\nunrepresentative: I too would be\nastonished if 35% of the Gay\npopulation had 2 to 10 partners per\nmonth!\nAndrew Bannister.\nSay no to conformists\nDear Dave,\nI'm always very suspicious when\npeople use phrases like \"It's not\nnatural\". What are they saying? A friend of mine once complained about\na German girl having hair under her\narms because \"It's not natural\",\nwhich of course it is. However, this\nshows what people really mean when\nthey say that homosexuality isn't natural. They mean they don't approve of it. In the same way that\nsome religious people can't rest until\neveryone loves the same god as they\ndo, these people want to stamp\neveryone conformist.\nIn some ways, the labels 'gay' and\n'straight' aren't helpful, as they imply\nthat everyone is one or the other,\nwhich isn't the case. 'Straight' is\nespecially unhelpful, as it is the\nopposite of 'bent', and therefore leads\nheterosexuals to think of themselves\nas 'untainted'. Why not just aim for\na society in which adults can do what\nthey like with a consenting adult\npartner?\nI think IC's gays are likely to have\nvery limited success at changing\npeople's attitudes here, as most\npeople's prejudices are well dug-in by\nnow. Not until homosexuality is\ntaught as a part of sex education in\nschools will many adults refrain from\ntalking about gays in the same way\nas they did in the school playground,\nwhere they first learnt about them.\nAfterall, sex education that only\nmentions heterosexuality is like\nreligious education that only mentions\nChristianity. The implication is 'This\nis what we do and everyone else is\nwrong'. Parents who claim that for\na teacher to admit that gay people\nexist would be to damage a child's development, are quite happy to have\nthe same children watch mindless\nviolence and death on video.\nA catholic a quaint ance of mine was\ninforming me of the damnation gays\nwere destined for, when I asked him\nwhat someone was supposed to do if\nthey were born gay. He replied he\ndidn't believe people were born gay,\nbut that they chose to act\n'unnaturally'. As I pointed out, they\nwould be choosing intense\npersecution, and why would they do\nthis? His reply was 'Because it's trendy'. Make of that what you will.\nWhen I see two gays holding hands\nin the street, I can feel happy for them\nin a way that is difficult when I see\na man and woman together, as this\njust reminds me that it's ages since\nI had a realy close female friend\nmyself. My own fault for coming to\nImperial perhaps, or maybe most\nwomen would prefer people such as\n'Mr Dork'.\nYours,\nRichard G Fincher\n\n"

At Headingley in Yorkshire England and\nPakistan are playing cricket from July\n2nd to 7th, starting at 11am, with\nother matches at Edgebaston in\nBirmingham from July 23rd to 28th and in London at either Lords or The\nOval from August 6th to 11th. Also\nin northern lands there's a race\nmeeting at York from August 18th to\n20th, and from September 9th to 12th there is the St Leger at Doncaster.\nPlaces to see include the Island of\nLindisfarne, off the coast of Northumberland, which can be\nreached by bus when the tide is out\nand the ruins of Fountains Abbey\nwhich stand in a beautifully\nlandscaped garden with lake,\nwater garden and deer park and can be\nreached from Ripon by bus or foot.\nIn Cleveland (North Yorkshire), the\nformer Spanish-Armada-beacon site\nof Roseberry Topping rises a fifth of\na mile high. Across the Pennines in\nCumbria there is so much to see and\nwalk on that my puny pen feels\ne mbar assed to write about it. but of\nparticular interest is the steam launch\nGondola which sails five times a day\non Coniston Water to show off the\nsights in a55 minute round trip,\ncosting \u00a33. Further South, in\nCheshire and Merseyside are two\npicturesque half timbered houses,\nLittle Moreton Hall and Speke Hall,\neach with a garden and the latter with\na park, and in Derbyshire between\nMansfield and Chesterfield stands\nHardwick Hall, built for a contemporary of Elizabeth I, Bess of\nHardwick, who married five\nhusbands each of whom was\nsuccessively richer. There is also a park and a walled garden with a scented herb and flower garden\nrecommended for visually\nhandicapped visitors.\nThere is quite a lot going on in the\nMidlands. From July 6th to 9th the\nRoyal Agricultural Society are having\na fair at Stoneleigh in Warks, just off\nthe A444, near Coventry. The site is\nso large they need barrage balloons\nto show people the way back to the\ncar parks. There'same tee of events;\nshow jumping prize cattle and\nvegetables, children's farm of young\nanimals, stands for different countries\nwhere you get free food samples as\nwell as being able to buy you\nbier wurst and croissants (this year\nNew Zealand, France and Germany\nare participating amongst others), and\nlast time I was there, a whole marquee\ndevoted to new strains of strawberry,\nwith plates strategically positioned for\ntesting. It's a lovely day out, not just\nfor ye var mers, the only drawback\nbeing that it costs \u00a37; \u00a33.50 for under\n16s, and after 1pm( it opens at 10am) it is \u00a33.50 and \u00a32 respectively. The\nsame people are organising a Town\nand Country Festival from August\n29th to 31st. A Grand Prix is taking place at\nSilverstone near Northampton on\nJuly 12th \u2014formula one no less, but\nunless you're an a ff ici on a do these\nevents seem very expensive.\nBirmingham is having its very own\nrace-round-the-tower blocks Grand\nPrix on the August Bank Holiday; lets\nhope the weather is kinder to them\nthis year. Also on August 28th to 31 st\nis the mega Christian Arts Festival,\nGreenbelt, at Canons Ashby Park in\nNorthamptonshire, with bands,\nmime, dance, seminars fine art etc,\nbring your own camping gear.\nBaddesley Clinton is a particularly\nbeautiful manor house built from\n1300\u20141634 and run by the National\nTrust, set in a small park with\nfish ponds and woods\u2014quaint and\nrelatively undiscovered by the tourist\ntrade. It costs \u00a31.80 and is open\nWednesday to Sunday and Bank\nHoliday Mondays, from 2pm until\n6pm, and can be found just off the\nA41 between Birmingham and\nWarwick. The National Trust also\nown part of the Long My nd in\nShropshire, and if you want to prove \u00bb\nhow tough you are, climb it!\nEast Anglia is almost synonymous\nwith the Norfolk broads, but if you\nwant to get away from the g rock les then there's the marshes and salting s at Brancaster, or Morston Marshes or\nStiffkey Salt Marshes, in Norfolk or\nthe cliffs and heaths of Dunwich in\nSuffolk, or you can watch the fallow\ndeer from a hide in Hatfield forest on f the Hertfordshire/Essex border.\nNorfolk also has a moat edme die vel manor house owned by the National \u2022\nTrust; Oxburgh Hall near Kings S Lynn, which is \u00a32 a throw for house,\ngarden and park but probably gets\nrather crowded. In Kent is the\nRomantic Scotney Castle Garden,\nwhere the castle ruins surrounded by\na moat, can be seen from Wednesday Iv. to Sunday for the paltry sum of \u00a31.90, fr f jI which includes a herb garden for\nthose with dim vision. Over in the\nCotwolds is the fantastic Westonburt\nArboretum with its thousands of acres\nof trees...and more trees.\nWales is full of lovely countryside,\nas well as large stone castles built by\nthe nasty English when they were still\nonly experimenting with Imperialism;\nConway, Har lech, Caer nav on. There's a military tattoo being held\nin or near Cardiff Castle from August\n5th to 15th, and appropriately enough\nit is largely musical.\nDespite a long run of bad summers\nthe West Country gets infested by\ntourists every year, and it is possibly\nto impress these that the locals put on\nRegattas, where they dress up in\nfunny costumes, have raft races, boat\nraces, pelt each other with flour, do\nthe Cornish floral dance, and in the\ntown of Fowey, cook and eat a10ft long pasty. Good clean family\nentertainment, and while you're there\nwhy not see St Michael's Mount\nwhich can be reached by ferry or foot\nat low tide, or Cotehele, an unspoilt\nmedieval manor with dove cote, working cider press, quay on the river\nTamar and its own sailing barge.\nThere is a great deal of coast under\npreservation orders or owned by the\nNational Trust, and it is possible to\nwalk round the whole SW peninsular.\nThere are tons, or even tonnes, of\nthings to do\u2014you could walk the\nRidgeway, the South Downs Way,\nThe Pennine Way, the Wealdway, the\nOffa's Dyke Path, Cotswold Way,\nIckneild Way or go Ascot on July\n25th or Glorious Goodwood from\nJuly 28th to August 1st. If you get\nbored with the UK slip over to Calais\nor Holland. So what do you think\nnormal people do in the Summer?\n\n"

Amongst the business was\nthe award of Union pots and\nHonorary Life Memberships for\ncontributions to the running of the\nUnion. In addition several elections\nwere held for non-officer posts in the\nUnion for next session.\nPossibly the most important\ndiscussion was about the Student\nResidence Committee (SRC). Ian\nHowgate presented a graphic and\nrather worrying account of some of\nthe recent SRC meetings. College\nAssistant Secretary Michael Arthur,\nhe reported, has overruled several\nSRC decisions, and has been known\nto alter minutes to suit his purposes.\nAs a result of this it was felt that SRC\nhad become totally ineffective. It was\ntherefore decided that Union reps on\nthis committee should observe at the\nmeetings but refuse to use their votes\nin protest at Michael Arthur's and\nCollege's conduct.\nAlso discussed at the meeting was\nthe use of the gravel money from\nHarlington. Several members thought\nthat the money could be used better\nif invested so as to use the interest\n(which could be quite substantial).\nHowever, it is uncertain how much\nmoney will be available due to\nfluctuating gravel prices. The money\nwill be held in trust by College, who\nare unlikely to release it in the near\nfuture. It was suggested that they\nmight even use it in the short term to\nboost their own cash flow.\nAt the meeting it was also decided\nto combine the posts of UGM and\nCouncil Chairpersons, and to make\nthis new officer responsible for Union\npolicy. Although this new post will\ncome into being at the end of next\nyear, incoming U GM Chairman\n'Ala;*\">ir Seymour was also elected\nCouncil Chairman and agreed to lay\nthe groundwork before the two posts\nofficially become one.\nAmongst the Honorary Life\nMemberships awarded were two for\nKevin Buckley (Bar Manager) and\nPete Hartley (Snack Bar worker),\nwho have both contributed beyond the\ncall of duty towards the smooth\nrunning of the Union Trading\nServices.\nNorburn\nkeeps quiet\nProfessor David Norburn, currently\nProfessor of Strategic Planning at\nCranfield, is to become Director of\nthe Imperial College School of\nManagement. The School of\nManagement is to be formed by the\nmerger of the Departments of\nManagement Science and Social and\nEconomic Science.\nProf Norburn refused to talk to\nFELIX on Tuesday.\nTower tours\nThe Queen's Tower will be opening\nto the public again this summer\ndespite mixed success last year.\nCollege Assistant Secretary Michael\nArthur told FELIX that a larger\nadvertising campaign, including\nposters on the Tube and reduction in\nTower staff (from 7 to 2) would make\nthis year's scheme more profitable.\nThe Tower is expected to attract\n5,000 visitors, who will pay 60p for\nviewing the Tower and an exhibition\non the Imperial Institute.\nCrofton\nc langer There were red faces all round in the\nMechanical Engineering Department\nwhen one of this year's examination\npapers was made available for sale to\nstudents in advance. Because of an\n\"administration error\" the 1987\nMaterials multiple choice paper was\nincluded amongst past papers on sale\nin the undergraduate office. Although\na replacement paper was written at\nshort notice, many candidates were\nstruck by the similarity between the\nreplacement and the original paper.\nDr Seamus Crofton, who was\nresponsible for writing both papers,\nsaid that the mistake would not give\nany candidates an unfair advantage\nbecause the answers were not\nincluded with the paper on sale.

    "content": "Union FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198712 Highway 61 Revisited\nLast week I was interviewed by one\nof the compilers of the Sunday Times\n\"Good University Guide\". It was an\ninformal interview, during which we\ntalked about many aspects of life at\nImperial. After a while my\ninterviewer turned to me and said,\n\"Now can you think of anything\npositive to say about Imperial\nCollege?\" Up until then I had thought\nI was being quite even-handed in\npresenting both sides of the\nargument\u2014something I always try to\ndo when I'm asked about Imperial.\nMaybe it's just that, after four years\nhere, and like most people who are\nabout to leave the place, I'm feeling\na little jaded. On the other hand many\npeople are genuinely surprised to hear\nan \"insider's\" view of a place with\nsuch a high academic reputation.\nOne thing this year has done for me\nis to give me a broad view of life at\nImperial, and to compare it to other\nLondon Colleges and to a lesser\nextent universities nationwide. I have\nfound that a view which was certainly\npresent in my own department is very\nwidespread\u2014that is, that this College\nproduces graduates by a sort of\nextrusion process; hard work and\nslog. Learning of reams of facts is the\nkey; the emphasis is not on original\nthought, creativity or intellectual\nstimulation. This is not only a great\ndisappointment to those who come\nhere filled with enthusiasm for their\nsubject (and perhaps having rejected\noptions like medicine as being\nlearning \u2014based rather than thought-based) but also seems to contradict the\nvery essence of a good scientist or\nengineer; that is, someone with a lively mind, ideas and commonsense.\nIs this really what a good education\nis about? I very much doubt it.\nImperial's high reputation\u2014which is\nwell-founded on its excellent research\nrecord\u2014continues to attract\nemployers and, to a certain extent,\npotential students. But how many\nstudents derive a great deal of\npleasure from their degree course, or\nfeel that they are left with much of\ninterest and relevance at the end of it?\nIt is immensely sad that so many end\nup studying only for the sake of\nachieving the final qualification and\nthen head off as fast as possible into\nfields far removed from their degree\nsubject.\nEverybody knows about the social\nimbalances of Imperial College; the\nlack of women, the disproportionate\nnumber of public school students.\nThis creates problems which we all\nknow about and which affect\neveryone. However, I often feel that\nthe social atmosphere here is not as\ndesperate as it's made out to be. There\nare still friends to be made, there are\nhuge numbers of sporting,\nrecreational and cultural clubs and\nfacilities available; the whole of\nLondon is there to be sampled. It's not really all that bad. What really\ndistresses me about this place is that\nImperial, for all its \"academic\nexcellence\" and wonderful\nopportunities for postgraduate\nresearch, continually fails to inspire\nits students; in fact in many cases it\nmanages to rid them of any\nenthusiasm they once had for their\nsubject. I for one do not call that\neducation.\nSo, will things improve? Who\nknows? It does seem that departments\nwill have to broaden their courses,\nmake them more flexible and\naccessible to students from a wide\nrange of academic backgrounds\npurely to fill places. Entrance\nstandards will have to become wider,\nif not lower. These facts have good\nimplications for the social life and\npromise to make courses more\nenjoyable\u2014who knows, perhaps even\nmore relevant and inspiring.\nHowever, even as departments realise\nthat this direction is necessary for\ntheir survival, they will find it\ndifficult to implement the changes. At\na time when the Government judges\nthe education system largely by the\ncost involved in churning out one\nstudent; at a time when competing for\nresearch contracts becomes more and\nmore important; at a time when\ndepartments are having to cut their\nacademic staff numbers, it is difficult\nto see how they can possibly find the staff and resources to make courses\nmore flexible and interesting.\nTo me, one of the most depressing\nthings about this election is its\nprobable effect on education. True,\neducation does cost money and it is\nan investment which does not show\nfinancial returns overnight. However\nwithout that investment a generation,\nindeed the country as a whole, has a very gloomy future. In fact education\nas such appears to be going out of\nfashion. Narrow, rapid, low-cost\nchurning out of fodder for industry\nand commerce is the current aim.\nWhose interests can this possibly\nserve?\nI am sorry to end the year on such\na bleak note. However I am only too\nwell aware of the changes those\ncurrently in the education system will\nexperience during Thatcher's third\nterm. Changes in the grants system\nand loss of state benefits will be the\nobvious, immediate effects. Expect\nalso to see departments contracting,\ngood staff leaving for a less pressured\nenvironment and resources\ndwindling. I can only wish everybody\ninvolved in managing and coping with\nthese changes the best of luck. As far\nas the Student's Union goes, I suspect\nthe time has come to take the blinkers\nfrom our eyes and to start looking\noutwards. There is more to student\nissues than the price of beer. How can\nwe remain apolitical in days like\nthese? As for me, for the first time\nin my life I am prepared to join the\nLabour Party for all its faults and to\ndo anything I can towards changing\nthe course of the next government. If\nnothing else, I would like to think that\nif I do ever have children there will\nbe an education for them worthy of\nthe name.\nThe Final Bit\nThis year has been both good and bad\nin parts. There's not much more to\nsay that I haven't already said in my\nAnnual Report; I'm looking forward\nto leaving, but not without twinges of\nregret and nostalgia. It only remains\nto say thank you once more to Jackie\nand Gutman for being excellent\ncolleagues and wonderful friends; to\nJen, Pat and Kathy for making the\nUnion Office both successful and\nhugely enjoyable; to anyone in\nCollege or the Union who has helped,\nadvised, or just been kind; to all our\nstaff and Union officers; to Dave\nJones for getting FELIX out every\ntime, for printing all my drivel\nunedited and for consistently putting\nhis neck on the line in support of\nworthy causes; to Chris Martin for an\nincredible amount of help when and\nwherever necessary, not to mention\nfriendship; and finally to Alan Clarke\nfor giving me more love and support\nthis year than I can possibly have\ndeserved! To everyone else, have a wonderful Summer, and the best of\nluck in the future.\nGoodbye,\nLove, Christine\nTRAINEE ACCOUNTANTS\nInitially \u00a38,500 rising to \u00a310,350\non completion of level 2 professional examinations\nThe College wishes to recruit a number of graduates as trainee accountants,\nworking in the central administration.\nThe trainees will be expected to undertake a wide range of accounting duties,\naimed at giving them the fullest practical experience in all aspects of financial\nmanagement. They will be given progressively increasing responsibility within\nthe College as a preparation for eventual management roles. The experience\ngained will fit the trainees for accountancy posts at a responsible level within\nthe public sector or in industry.\nThe trainees will be expected to pursue courses leading to membership of the\nChartered Association of Certified Accountants, normally obtainable within\n3 or 4 years. Day release (one day a week during term-time l and financial\nassistance with tuition/examination fees, text books etc will be given.\nFurther particulars from Jason Gold (01-589 5111 ext 3108)\nor Malcom Aldridge (ext 3135), or call in at Level 4, Sherfield Building\nWalter Returns\nFor reasons to be explained later, this\nis likely to be Walter's last\ncontribution to these pages for a considerable number of years. One\nhopes the next one will be worth the\nwait. And now:\nWalter was delighted to receive an\ninvitation to that most august of\nannual events, the President's Dinner.\nHe found himself sharing a table with\nHurricane Christine, past President\nMary Attenborough, and some\nchap pie called Eric Ash, and the\nconversation flowed as freely as the\nRoija until well past midnight. By the\ntime the port had been passed round\nfor the third time, Walter was well\nimpressed with the Ash fellow, and\nhe suggests that the governors of\nImperial College employ him in some\ncapacity as soon as possible.\nPerhaps the high point of the\nevening came with the toast proposed\nby the Deputy President, Jackie the\nBeanstalk: 'Up yours, Christine!' Mr\nHowgate cleverly avoided the whole\nthing by being in Sweden, an excuse\nwhich apparently had not occured to\nCollege Secretary John Smith\u2014a worrying lack of imagination in one\nwho holds such a position of power.\nFinally, Walter regrets that, owing\nto the over-zealous activities of the\nInland Revenue, he expects to spend\nthe next fifteen years in a large house\nin the Wormwood district, with no\ntime off for good behaviour.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198730 It has always been noticeable that\nthose who regularly pour scorn on\nFELIX have little idea of how much\nwork is involved in its production. A brief analysis of how much time is put\ninto the paper may be an eye-opener\nfor one or two of our readers.\nTo deal first with the professionals:\nthe Print Unit has two permanent\nmembers of staff, a typesetter\noperator and a printer. Each of them\nwork 35 hours per week. The\nsabbatical Editor nominally works a35 hour week as well; the reality is\nsomething more like 75 hours.\n145 hours so far. Of the student\nstaff, there is a nucleus of about six\nwho regularly put in 20-25 hours each\nweek; 135 altogether, say. The\nremainder of the regular staff (another\nsix people or so) probably notch up\nabout 10 hours per week; in addition\nthere are many more occasional\ncontributors and production\nconsultants (colla tors) who give up\n2-3 hours each week; 30 hours total\nis a reasonable average.\nThis makes a total of 370 hours.\nGiven that the FELIX print run\naverages slightly less than 4000, this\nmeans that for every man hour that\ngoes into the production of FELIX, ten copies are printed. If this seems\nrather labour-intensive, then at least\ntry reading FELIX for more than the\nsix minutes it took to produce your\ncopy before you throw it away!\nThe cost of each copy of FELIX is\nalways a favourite topic of discussion.\nThere are usually 32 issues of\nFELIX each year; the average\ncirculation is slightly under 4,000.\nLet's take 4,000 copies of 30\nissues-a total of 120,000 FELICE S. FELIX receives a grant of \u00a310,777\nfrom the Union's central sub vent ion. In addition there are the salaries for\nthe two permanent members of staff\nand the sabbatical Editor (slightly less\nthan \u00a320,000), making a total cost of\naround \u00a330,000. Hence this familiar\ncalculation (\u00a330,000+120,000) gives\nyou a cost per copy of 25p. Expensive, perhaps. However, this\nignores the work that FELIX does as\nthe Union Print Unit\u2014producing\npublicity material for many of the\nUnion clubs and societies. This year\nwe have brought in about \u00a310,000 of\nincome for printing work within the\nUnion, at our cut-price rates. To have\nthis volume of work done at a professional London printer would\nprobably cost about four times as\nmuch. A saving of \u00a330,000 meaning\neach copy of FELIX is effectively\nfree. If this seems like a rather\ninflated claim, it might be interesting\nto note, for example, that at a recent\nprinting show a \"budget\" print shop\nquoted typesetting at \u00a32.80 per foot.\nThe FELIX charge is 40p per foot.\nEnjoy the holiday!\n\n"

All they needed was\nthe 'big break' the chance to play\nalongside Ian Gillan, say, or take over\nfrom Randy Rhodes with Ozzy\nOsborne; just like Bernie Torme.\nHowever, neither of these were to\nwork out for Bernie, and it was back\nto his long standing personal projects.\nThe past couple of years have seen the\nrise of Torme, the band; there was\neven keen record company interest,\nwhich sadly came to nothing. The\nbiggest blow came a few months ago\nwhen ex-Girl vocalist, Phil Lewis,\ndeserted to America and the LA Guns.\nThe new band has emerged under\nthe guise of the Gypsy Cowboys. The\nline up features Chris Heilman (bass),\nSteve Dior (vocals) and A Random\n(drums), but I have been told Steve\nis only temporarily up front.\nAll of the old faces were in the\ncrowd, ready for the return of their\nhero, who arrived casually onto the\nMarquee stage and not surprisingly\nused Wild West as an opener. In fact\nthe show was to see only three songs\nfrom the Torme era, the most notable\nof these being Star, a perfect mixture\nof hard rock guitar riffs and pop\nmelody.\ncan often get best value for your\nmoney from the New World. Among\nthe whites, the Austalian Hunter\nValley Semillon Chardonnay from\nPenfolds is \u00a38.15 a bottle and well\nworth a try. Also from Aus is the red\nKoonunga Hill 1985 at \u00a38.95.\nThe food at the launch party last\nweek was excellent, as you'd expect.\nIt remains to be seen how the quality\nkeeps up. The sample menus look\nexciting, though. Apple and stilton\nsoup; sau teed duck's livers, chicken\nand artichoke pie; fresh pasta with\nbasil, bacon and cream; blackcurrant\nand mint pie.\nA long way from the Ploughman's lunch. But, of course, it's a bit more\npricey, too. You don't have to have\na three-course meal, so if you just\nwant a starter and a glass of wine,\nallow a minimum of \u00a35 a head.\nFor a three course meal with wine,\nallow at least \u00a315.\nThere are few more pleasant ways\nof sliding inexorably further into debt\nthan in the consumption of fine wines\nand good food in pleasant\nsurroundings.\nBernie's work tonight seemed more\nrelaxed and flowing than of late. He\nthrew solos and riffs at the audience\nin a manner which showed he was in\ncontrol and was not holding anything\nback to soothe a Phil Lewis ego,\nindeed the vocalist Steve Dior didn't seem to have a personality, never\nmind an ego!\nMr Dior was the one disappointment of the show. He was totally\nlost in the sound mix and what was\naudible was little more than average.\nAdd to this his lack of stage presence\nand it all comes to a dead end\ncareer-wise.\nThe rhythm section of the band\ncould not be faulted, in fact the\ndrummer was a good deal better than\nBernie'sold drummer, Ian\nWhitewood. As ever, Chris Heilman\nprovided a good solid and relevant\nbass line.\nIn its present form, ie with that\nvocalist, the band is not as strong as\nthey were with Phil Lewis. However,\nthe band is more comfortable without\nhim and, given a vocalist with\npersonality but no ego, this could well\nbe the line up that gives Bernie his\nchan'ce, perhaps his last chance.\nDavid Williams\nRock\nRock. Riff and a random\nBooks\nThe silent\ntwins\nIn the spring of 1982, two girls were\nsentenced to an indefinite period of\ndetention at Broadmoor. Their names\nwere Jennifer and June Gibbons,\nnineteen-year-old twins. The incredible story of their lives and the\nevents leading up to their trial and\nincarceration is told in a new book by\naward winning campaign journalist of\nthe Times and Sunday Times,\nMarjone Wallace.\nThe story is one of the ultimate\nlove- hate relationship between\nidentical twins, the struggle for\nindividuality and recognition in an\nuncaring world, and their final cry for\nhelp and downfall.\nThe twins were born daughters of\na Service family in Aden, and their\nearly lives were characterised by the\nendless moving associated with\nForces life. However, it soon became\nclear that they were not destined to\nbe normal happy children. They were\nslow to start speaking, and as soon as\ntheir schooling began, their speech\ndevelopment ground to a halt. They\nbecame shy, introverted, speaking\nonly to one another, in private, while\npresenting a wall of silence to the\noutside world. Incredibly, this went\nunchecked, and by the time they\nreached teenage life, they were\napparently totally uneducated. In\nprivate they had lived on a diet of pulp\nfiction and television, developing a love of writing tainted by all that is\nworst in the distorted view of life\npresented by romantic novels and\nAmerican television. Locked away in\ntheir room at home they took\ncorrespondence courses in writing,\nspent what little money they had on\nattempting to get their work\npublished, and wrote endless diaries.\nTragically, they developed a deadly\nlove-hate relationship, competing to1 be best in whatever they did. This\nballooned in their liaisons with US Air Force servicemen at the base\nwhere they lived. Jealousy between\nthe two led to fights and even attempts\non one another's lives. Realising that\nthey were paradoxically inseparable,\nbut unable to exist together, the twins\nset out on a course of destruction and\ncrime as a cry for help.\nThe tale is riveting, but the style of\nwriting can be annoying. In an\nattempt to prevent the story being\nrecounted as a medical case history\nit hops between excerpts from the\ntwins' diaries, interviews with\nconcerned par lies, and a presentation\nof the story in novel form. Despite\nthese distractions, the book is\ncompulsive reading, and a fascinating\ninsight into the psychology of twins,\nwith an ultimately tragic ending.\nDavid Burns\n\n"

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198734 THE\nCATCH IN\nTHE RYEBREAD\nIn a century which has seen the fall\nof Slater-Walker, insider trading\ncarried on routinely, and the\nlaundering of millions of pounds from\nthe Brinks Mat robbery, one\nremarkable con trick has made all of\nthese pale into insignificance. A fraud\nso audi a cio us that it could only have\nbeen carried out with the billions of\ndollars available to the largest of the\nmultinationals.\nThe number of people to have been\ntaken in must now run into the\nbillions. Whole nations have been\npossessed by the promises of these\ntricksters, and convinced to part with\nvast sums of their money.\nThere can only be one thing that be\ndescribed this way; it is not the\nadult e ring of petrol with peanut oil,\nnor the imagined harvest of jojo ba nuts in Paraguay but that\"passport to\na better life\", the health food boom.\nEven the most elaborate con tricks\nof the past have never involved the\ncomplicity of so many of the medical\nand nutritional fraternity. Each had to\nbe expensively bought off and\nextensively briefed by a team\ndedicated to carrying off their fraud\nand the money that came with it.\nIt was in 1973, with the beginnings\nof the oil crisis that the thoughts of\ntwo of the largest fast food\nmanufacturers turned to increased\nprofits. In America the huge consortia\nof Global Foods Inc and International\nCatering, responsible for 90% of the\nWestern fast food network, became\nincreasingly concerned with the\nsaturation of the hamburger market.\nThey were making new inroads into\nEurope as they set about replacing\nfish and chip shops and cafes, but it\nwas readily apparent that once those\nmarkets were taken up, no amount of\ncheap Coke would help them.\nWith this in mind they recruited\nSteve Chlebowski, leading business\nconsultant and pioneer of computer\nfraud. Born Steven Martin Bowie, he\nchanged his surname to Chlebowski\non the advice of his manager when he\nwas harbouring ambitions of becoming a rock guitarist. However\nhe soon found that his destiny was as\none of the kingpins of the American\nBusiness System\u2014a covert action\nconsultant.\nGeorge Sand, who has spent much\nof the last decade researching into\nChlebowski's career, takes up the\nstory:\n\"Chlebowski was a master; while\nthe companies could only think of\nexpanding fast food into the\nCommunist bloc, he came up with the\nidea of a competing principle\u2014the\ncompanies would set about marketing\nhealth foods. He would harness the\nforces of the hippy era, pretend to\nturn them against the giants, and in\nturn make them vast profits from the\nsale of ad uki beans and lentils.\n\"It was simple, while the hippies\nand natural food freaks suffered from\ndiarrhoea and digestive problems,\nvast amounts of money would be\nspent convincing doctors and\nscientists that junk food would kill and\nhealth foods would save them.\n\" OK, you m might think that if you\ngot chronic diarrhoea and all you\nwere eating was vegetables, you'd put\ntwo and two together and figure that\nthis health food stuff wasn't so\nwonderful. Then words like\n\" cholesterol\" and \" hardened arteries\" came along as if by magic,\nor in Chlebowski's case, as if by\nbribery. Suddenly meat, not to\nmention hamburgers and deep fried\nchicken, was a passport to the\nmortuary. All they had to do was\nconvince the public at large that eating\njunk was naughty and that bran\nenriched lentils were where it was at.\n\"It was making junk food taboo\nthat proved to be Chlebowski's masterstroke. It's like sex, once you\ntell people that they shouldn't do it,\nand should beat themselves with birch\ntwigs instead, you get a couple of\nmugs who get into self-flagellation,\nbut the rest think that it must be\nsomething really good and will do\nanything to get it. Likewise, when\neveryone started to hear that junk was\ngoing to kill you, they figured that it\nmust be like snorting coke, and they\nall went out and got into burgers.\n\"What the companies had to do\nwas to make sure that they controlled\nthe supplies of all the health foods as\nwell. It actually turned out to be quite\na simple operation. In the early days\nthe only people who actually grew\nthings like ad uki beans, lentils and\nsoya beans were those hippies that\nhadn't become accountants and\nstockbrokers. Buying them out\n\"They figured that it\nmust be like snorting\ncoke, and they all went\nout and got into\nburgers.\"\nproved to be no problem, all\nChlebowski had to do was tell them\nhow the CIA had planned to\nassassinate the Grateful Dead and they\ngave them the lot. Of course they got\nthe hippies to farm the plantations.\nThey also got a couple of lucrative\ndope farms while they were at it,\nwhich brought in a few extra\ndollars.\"\nIt was after this that Chlebowski\nwas deemed to be too dangerous to\nthe companies, and had to be taken\nout. However, he guessed that the\natmosphere was turning against him\nand he disappeared. George found\nhim again two years ago:\n\" Yeah, he was making a living\nfrom selling ground up OXO cubes\nto high school kids at ten dollars an\nounce. But he got found out when one\nof the teachers took a drag. He was\ntalking about going into politics. I think he's running a chain of singles\nla und ret tes for American troops in\nLebanon, now.\" It was towards the end of the\nseventies that they discovered an\nincreasing trend among health freaks\nto eat a diet of all-bran and soya\nbeans, and then every month they\nwould binge on quarter pounder s, fries\nand hot apple pies. Not only were the\ncompanies making vast profits from\njunk, and selling carr away seeds at\nvastly inflated prices, but people were\nnow swallowing both.\n\"They would eat only health foods\nfor ages and then once they thought\nthat they were healthy enough they\nwould pig out on junk food,\" claimed\nfood-market analyst John Stuckley.\nHe has been studying the health food\nboom since he discovered the strange\ncorrelation between the expansion of\nfast food chains and the growth of the\nhealth food industry. Thinking that\nthere seemed to be no obvious way\nthat the two could go hand-in-hand he\ndecided to investigate further.\nHe found that nutritionists all over\nthe world had either been selectively\nhoodwinked or bribed by middlemen\nacting for the companies:\n\" A whole new corporation was\nformed to deal with the problem of\n'convincing' that many people that\nhealth foods were not a giant con\ntrick. However, if the fag companies\ncan manage to get their tar tables\nwidely accepted I suppose health\nfoods can't be too difficult. I mean\nthere is a certain grain of truth in the\nhealth foods idea, the sort of natural,\nno additives thing is quite attractive.\n\"In fact the whole story has been\nmade so plausible that it is probably\nGifficult to stop now. How do you set\nabout discrediting that many medical\nminds? If people start to scream\nconspiracy now they're liable to end\nup in a padded cell, all financed by\ngiant food multinationals.\n\"Rumour has it that the new boss\nof Global Foods has recently gone\nover to a soya/bran only diet\u2014he\nwon't touch junk. The files from the\nseventies seem to have disappeared\nsomewhere, and the old bosses aren't saying anything. It has reached such\nproportions that junk joints are\noffering burgers in brown bread with\nfree nutritional information. It's all\ngone mad.\" George Sand had one final thing to\nsay when we last contacted him:\n\"Apparently all the old directors of\nGlobal Foods and International\nCatering have left or retired. I rang\none of them up, Geoff Schmidt, and\nhe just muttered something about\noverseas singles la und ret tes being the\nthing to get into. Food seems to be\ngoing out of fashion.\"\n\n"

Finally, in\nJanuary of this year, the Student\nResidence committee announced that\nit was going to replace the locks, over\na year and a half after the master key\nwas went missing.\nPersonal possessions weren't the\nonly things to go missing from Halls\nof Residence. In Weeks Hall the\nwater supply went missing in January,\nwith residents having to flush toilets\nusing fire hoses. The residents\ndecided to take direct action, and\nvoted unanimously for a rent strike.\nStudent Accomodation Officer Lesley\nGillingham said this move was\nunconstructive. although one week\nlater they were all told that all their\ndemands had been met, with repairs\nbeing done and \u00a38 rebates given as\ncompensation for inconvenience.\nMeanwhile FELIX was receiving\nwhispers about a College bid to get\nan extra 200 places in Evelyn Gardens\n(whispers which would have gone\nunheard in Beit Hall as the builders\nprepared to do lots of noisy things\nwith hammers during the exam\nrevision period). This was\nun doubt ably A Good Thing,\nproviding basic accommodation of the\ntype the many students need.\nUnfortunately the property was not\ncheap, and to fund it rents would have\nto hit the roof. Also hitting the roof\nwas the carpet (in Southwell and\nHolbein House). This is an oblique\nreference to the two occasions this\nacademic year when large lumps of\nplaster have dropped from the ceiling\nin College accommodation. Water\nloosened a ceiling in Holbein in the\nAutumn, and in May a3' by 2' lump\nof plaster fell to earth for no apparent\nreason at all, landing on someone's bed. Miraculously the bed was not\noccupied, despite the fact that the\nstudent was timetabled to have\nlecturers at the time.\nMessing around: Flan fun at the\nFreshers' Reception\nAcademics had accommodation\nproblems too. Members of staff in the\nDepartment of Computing had offices\nwhich were so cramped that they were\nbeing adopted as prisoners of\nconscience by Amnesty International.\nA new building was needed, and work\nstarted in the Autumn term, with a planned construction time of just 12\nmonths. Speculation about the name\nwas rife: the Department of\nComputing bookie was giving 3:1 on\n'The Sayers Building', after the\ncurrent head of the Computing\nStreaking ahead: Robin Andrew, Alistair Seymour; Murray Williamson\nand Stuart Brooks raised \u00a3500 for Rag in a sponsored streak in\nNovember\nStanding out: Deputy President Jackie Peirce shows her originality\nDepartment, Prof Sayers.

In fact, it is to be called 'The\nPenney Laboratory' after Lord\nPenney, the Rector of IC during the\nhippy days of the late 1960s and early\n1970s. Talking of new erections, the\nscramble to be a sabbatical started\nearly in the academic year. As usual\nchaos reigned, with the ballot for\nPresident being re-run after the\ncandidates were caught doing naughty\nthings with each other. If you want\nto refresh your memory on what\nhappened, I suggest that you look\nback through some old copies of\nFELIX, as there isn't the space to go\nthrough the whole sorry tale again.\nOr you could just wait until next year,\nbecause it will be exactly the same.\nConSoc continued to provide a useful social role within IC by\nattracting a very high proportion of\nthe pl on kers in College, and therefore\nleaving the rest of us free to have a good time without them. Contrary to\nmyth, IC ConSoc are not a bunch of\nfrothing fascists but are largely wets\nwho would join the SDP but are\nfrightened of being laughed at. This\nyear their moment of glory came\nwhen they invited a speaker from the\nSouth African embassy. However,\napparently fearing the appearance of\nrent-a mob, they kept the whole\nmeeting utterly, utterly top secret and\nall crossed their hearts and hoped to\ndie if they told anyone. Unfortunately\nthe word did get out, and it became\nobvious that a big demo would occur.\nThe speaker contracted a mysterious\nand highly convenient illness which\nprevented him coming, and the\nmeeting was postponed for a fortnight. It was rumoured that the\nspeaker desperately tried to give\nConSoc some hints on how to prevent\na demo taking place, which included\nshutting FELIX and invading France.\nWhen the speaker finally did turn up\nthe 'rent-a mob' reception turned out\nto resemble 'rent-a terribly-concerned\nperson', and apart from a few chants\nnothing very much happened.\nIf the protestors really wanted to\nmount a demo they should have\nprovided free food (presumably\nvegetarian whole food with no\nadditives), because this year has\nproved that IC students have their\nbrains in their stomachs, not their\nheads. In 1983 plans were unveiled\nfor a complete re-vamp of the catering\nfacilities in the Sherfield Building,\nwith the JCR, SCR and the kitchens\nall being shuffled round to create a dietary Disneyland of grills, bars and\ndiners. Unfortunately, cash became\nshort (no sup rise here) and they were\nmodified, reputedly by John Smith,\nMessing around: Bill Goodwin\n(above) and Ian Howgate (below)\n\n"

Other attractions included violin playing by the Rector for\na game of musical bumps, an auction run by John Smith in fancy dress,\nfree tours of the Queen's Tower by Michael Arthur, and others and\nbeefburger s barbequed personally by Rob Northey.\nThe weather remained fine all afternoon and the event was generally\nfelt to be a great success.

He was\npreviously involved in the repair of\nBig Ben whose speed governor shaft\nsheered in 1986 causing a dangerous\nincrease in the speed of the\nmechanism.\nThe professors had no hesitations\nin accepting their awards, and they\nwill both be presented to the Queen\nin the near future.\nlater this year.

This\nprevents Consoc from using their\nsub vent ion to pay for the booklet.\nSince there was not enough\nadvertising to cover the production\ncosts, the only apparent solution is to\nraise money from Consoc members.\nHowever, this possibility has been\nrejected by Consoc Chairperson Dave\nBurbage, who had previously checked\nwith Richard Eccleston (SCC\nChairperson) whether Union funds\ncould be used. However, it is believed\nthat Mr Eccleston was not informed\nthat the booklet would essentially be\na Conservative Party election\ndocument.\nAlthough the Ultra Vires laws\nwhich apply in these instances are\nvery vague, the Attorney General's guidelines suggest that Union funds\ncan only be used where a political\nmatter directly affects students. They\nalso state that Union Officers \"might\nbe at personal risk\" for being\n\"party\" to misuse of funds.\nUnion Deputy President Jackie\nPeirce said yesterday that she thought\nthat the editor of the booklet and the\nConsoc Chairperson would be\npersonally responsible for the\npayment if the account were not\nsettled. They would then become\n\"debtors to the Union\", which could\nlead to legal action.\nRCS keep old\nrecipe\nRCSU voted to stay with tradition\nonce again at the Gen Com on\nMonday night, when a motion\nproposed by Fiona Nicholas on the\nsubject of the 'mix' used in the Exec\ninitiations, was defeated. Ms Nicholas\nproposed that the mix should not\ncontain any animal, human or dairy\nproducts, except for fresh milk, due\nto the potential health risk involved,\nbut the committee rejected this.\nAnother motion, which prohibited\nthe practice of throwing RCS\nwrongdoers into the Round Pond in\nHyde Park was passed. RCS Vice\nPresident Judith Hackney, who\nproposed the motion told FELIX that\nthe Round Pond is quite shallow, and\nit is not unknown for there to be\nbroken glass on the bottom.\nInformation\non AIDS\nAIDS leaflets have now been\ndistributed to undergraduates\nthroughout College. The leaflets form\npart of an AIDS information\ncampaign, which also includes\npostgraduate students and all staff.\nICU President Christine Taig, who is\norganising the campaign, called for\nhelp 'stuffing envelopes' so that\npostgraduates could receive the\ninformation this week.\nUndergraduates had been a priority\nsince most will be leaving at the end\nof term, she explained.\nChris Martin, a concerned student,\ncommented yesterday: \"I think it's a jolly good idea.\"\nSDI film at\nIC\nImperial College has provided the\nlocation for an \"Open Space\"\nprogramme on the star wars initiative.\nThe programme features interviews\nwith a number of academics,\nincluding the Rector, Professor Eric\nAsh, and suggests that technology\nshould be used for more peaceful\npurposes.\nIn the film, which will launch a new\nseries of Open Space on July 14th, the\nRector gave assurances that Imperial\nwould only accept SDI funding\nprovided there were no classification\nclauses and no discrimination against\nRussian, Chinese or other foreign\nresearchers in the contracts. He\nexpressed his unhappiness with the\nSDI programme in general and his\nconcern that it would draw resources\nfrom civil projects. The film also\nfeatures interviews with Professor\nManny Lehman of Computing who\nexplained his reasons for accepting an\nSDI contract, Dr Jerry Legget of\nGeology and VERTISC (Verification\nTechnology Information Centre) who\ncondemned the use of \"rigged\nexperiments\" in the American\ndemonstration videos, and Mr Harry\nFairbrother of the Maths Department,\nwho carried out research into the first\natomic bomb.\nASTMS leader John Fecamp, who\ncompiled the programme, told FELIX\nthat he was unable to find anyone at\nImperial publicly in favour of SDI,\nand said that he hoped the film would\nwiden the issues to industry and the\nrest of society.\nFour universities are currently\nengaged in SDI research: Herriot\nWatt is working on optical computers,\nand Aston, Newcastle, and RHBNC\nare working on electrical insulators.\nNo contracts have yet been awarded\nto Imperial, though several academics\nare understood to have applied for\nresearch.\nBoaties to go to games\n\n"

The\ncities visited \u2014 Moscow, Leningrad and\nWarsaw \u2014 and the concentration camps\nwere fascinating places which could not be\nsummarised in a thousand pictures or a million words. One can only hope to impart\na flavour of the trip and to give the historical\nbackground of the images.\n1. These portraits were taken of women prisoners in Auschwitz, near Krakow, at the\nbeginning of the war. Each photograph is\ncaptioned by the name, occupation, date of\nentrance to the camp and date of death.\nThose who looked most defiant in the\npictures tended to have the shortest camp\nlifespans. Later in the war, the Nazis were\nunable to keep such records as too many people were being killed too quickly.\n2. In 1917 Lenin returned from exile to lead\nthe revolution in Russia. He arrived at\nFinland Station in the capital, St Petersburg\n(Petrograd, now Leningrad), where he made\nhis famous 'Peace, Land, Bread' speech The\nstatue which now stands in front o*v.e station commemorates this event.\n3. These murals are typical of those which can be found in many places in Moscow and\nLeningrad. Painted in striking colours they\npromote the slogan of the day while\nbrightening dreary walls.\n4. The Exhibition of Economic Achievement in Moscow has many buildings\ndevoted to different areas of industry,\ntechnology and agriculture. This picture\nshows the exhibition on Atomic energy with\na model of a Light Water Cooled, Graphite\nModerated Reactor to the left. Two months\nafter 'Chernobyl', however, there was little\nreference to the disaster.\n5.This poster was an exhibit at the Museum\nof the October Revolution in Moscow which covers political and economic events from\nthe revolution in 1917 to the present day.\nPrinted during the war, the poster is a reminder that the 'Western' and 'Eastern'\nblocks have not always existed \u2014 we were\nall on the same side once.\n6. While we were in Warsaw, Comrade\nGorbachev was also there for the Party\nCongress. The 'People's Palace' in which it\ntook place had been given to Warsaw by\nStalin who had had seven similar buildings\nconstructed in Moscow.\n7. This is a photograph of a hut at Birkenau,\na Nazi concentration camp just along the\nroad from Auschwitz. When the Nazis\nrealised that defeat was inevitable, they\nmurdered as many Jews and Poles as they\ncould and then burnt Birkenau to the ground\nto destroy the evidence. Of the scores of huts\nwhich had existed, only the brick chimneys\nnow remain. This hut was reconstructed after\nthe war.\n8. Warsaw was completely destroyed\nduring the war but was subsequently rebuilt\nso that one can still walk through the 'old'\nparts of town. There were many open fruit\nand vegetable stands in Warsaw, like the one\non the left, which sold goods which were\nprobably slightly radioactive. There were no\nsuch stalls in Moscow or Leningrad. The strawberries were delicious.\n\n"

This showed how\ndesperate the accommodation crisis at\nIC really was: there was a grand total\nof three home PGs in Hall last year.\nAs usual, the solution to the whole\naccommodation problem appeared to\nbe the building of a new Hall of\nResidence above the swimming pool\nin Northside. However, the massive\ncost of this scheme has always made\nthis something of a impossible dream.\nEven if the money could be found to\nbuild it, there is no doubt that the non-student inhabitants of the area would\nobject to its construction, fearful of\na further invasive wave of acne-covered students, vomiting on the\npavements and wandering around\nwith no trousers at 3-o clock in the\nmorning. With this in mind, the\nRector took the opportunity to ask all\nthe new students to turn down their\nhi-fis and not to indulge in late-night\ndrunken orgies (unless he was\ninvited).\nThere were problems even with the\naccommodation that the College had\ngot, most notably security. College\nofficials spend so much time\ncongratulating themselves for\nproviding students with a roof over\ntheir heads that they forget that they\nought to provide doors as well. IC\nHalls of Residence have always been\ninsecure, and everyone who has ever\nlived in them is aware of this.\nHowever, when a woman was\ntragically raped on College premises\nin Hamlet Gardens in October some\nCollege officials seemed genuinely\nsurprised that such a thing could\noccur. Perhaps one way of waking up\nthe Imperial Bureaucracy to the\nproblems would be to set aside a room\nin one of the Halls of Residence, and\ninvite every official who has to take\ndecisions about security to leave some\nvaluable item of theirs (camera,\ncompact disc player etc) locked in it\nfor a term. After a term the room\nwould be unlocked, and lo! all their\nstuff would have been nicked \u2014 then\nperhaps something might be done.\nThe College did respond to the rape,\nalbeit in a bumbling way, getting the\nlocks in Hamlet Gardens changed.\nUnfortunately they did not give new\nkeys to the residents or the warden,\nwho arrived back after a day in\nCollege to find themselves locked out.\nThe warden ended up doing an SAS\nact and climbed in through the\nwindow, while the students, lacking\nfinesse, smashed the doors in.\nStill the charade continued, with\n\u00a32000 worth of personal stereos, etc\ngoing missing from Linstead at the\nend of November, and another \u00a31000\nworth two weeks later.

    "content": "Feature. FELIX, Wednesday June 24th198722 The United Nations:\nTwo years ago on October 24th, the)\nUnited Nations celebrated its fortieth\nanniversary. Created after the Second\nWorld War \"to save : succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge or\nwar...\", it has since expanded its base\nand now countenances 40 years of the\nmost turbulent change in history. The\nchallenge for the UN now seems to\nbe to justify to the developed world\nthe very need for its existence.\nThe general attitude towards the\nUN among western student\npopulations is, I have found, one of\nindifferent ignorance. Enquiries\ngenerally produce vague descriptions\nof \"something to do with human\nrights\". Where people are slightly\nmore informed, the picture is of \" a group of overpaid individuals who\nmake up the greatest and most\npowerless bureaucracy ever; an\norganisation which squanders\ngovernments' money on endless\nconferences and adopts innumerable,\nlargely-ignored resolutions in political\nmatters over which it has no control''.\nThe disparity between the public\nopinion of the United Nations and the\nfacts is alarming, and seems to be at\nthe root of recent criticism directed\nat the organisation.\nThe Facts\nThe United Nations system is a nongovernmental organisation,\nregrouping 159 member countries. It\nconsists of the United Nations\nOrganisation ( UNO) and its\nspecialised programmes, and of 18\nspecialised agencies and autonomous\ninternational organisations. The UNO consists of the General Assembly, the\nSecretariat, the Trusteeship Council\n(concerned with de colonisation matters), the International Court of\nJustice, the Security Council and the\nEconomic and Social Council,( ECOSOC). The latter controls the\nUNO' s14 specialised programmes\nand funds, such as UNICEF( the\nUnited Nations Childrens Fund)\nUNDP( the United Nations\nDevelopment Fund) and UNHCR( the\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees).\nECO SOC also deals with the\nspecialised agencies such as the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO)\nthe Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organisation ( UNESCO), the Food and Agriculture\nOrganisation ( FAO) and the\nInternational Labour Office (ILO).\nLess prominent agencies include the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA), the World Meteorological\nOrganisation ( WMO), the Universal\nPostal Union (UPU) or the World\nIntellectual Property Organisation\n(WIPO).\nAs it appears from this brief sketch,\nthe United Nations is involved in\nevery possible aspect of society, and\nthe bulk of the UN has nothing to do\nwith politics. Over 80% of the\norganisation's time and energy is\ndevoted to economic, social and\nhumanitarian issues, which tend to go\nlargely in noticed in our society\nbecause they lack the media appeal of,\nfor example, Live Aid. The UN is\nassociated with political conflicts,\nhuman rights, the global economic\nsituation or the eradication of\nsmallpox, yet there are few who\nwould link it with the preservation of\nScandanavian countries train\ntroops specially for UN service.\nrelics, the control of illegal drugs, the\nallocation of radio frequencies or the\nprotection of patents on records; all\nthese come within the scope of UN activities.\nIt seems the sheer size and scope\nof the UN have engendered feelings\nof distrust or hostility within the\nWestern public, feelings which are\nnurtured by various clich es and\nmisconceptions concerning the\norganisation.\n\"The United Nations is\nan independent\narb it ary body\"\nIt is not. As its name implies, the\nUnited Nations is its member states;\n159 governments which together\nj tna ke decisions on important issues,\neach nation being expected to fulfill\nthe commitment it made to complying\nwith the UN charter.\n\"The UN is a bureaucracy\"\nThe United Nations Organisation uses\n2,205 tons of paper every year (less\nthan The New York Times uses in a single Sunday Edition). This amount\nof paper may sound phenomenal, but\nlarge organisations or governments\nneed to keep accurate records and\nreports; in the UN many of these have\nto be kept in the General Assembly's six official languages; Arabic,\nChinese, English, French, Russian\nand Spanish. Nevertheless, intense\nefforts are being made to restrict the\nsize of documents.\n\"The UN places unfair\nfinancial burdens on\ngovernments, and the\nmoney is inefficiently\nspent\"\nIn 1985 the United Nations and its\nrelated agencies spent $5.4 billion. Of this, $2.1 billion (39%) was spent on\nrelief activities, $1.8 billion (33%) on\nhealth and $1.4 billion (26%) on\nagriculture, forestry and fisheries.\nThe expenditure of the UN is often\nbranded as unjustified, an incredible\nattitude given that, for the same\nperiod, the world spent over $1000\nbillion on armament alone.\nThe UNO regular budget is of\n$840billion pa and is paid by member\nstates. It constitutes one third of the\nsystem's income, the other two thirds\ncoming from voluntary contributions\nby governments, non-governmental\norganisations and individuals.\nThree countries, (the United States,\nJapan and West Germany), contribute\n29% of the UN budget. This may\nsound unfair, but although these three\nnations make the largest cash\ncontributions, a different picture\nemerges when contribution as a percentage of national income is\nconsidered; the three top donors are\nnow Gambia (0.6%), Equatorial\nGuinea (0.44%) and Comoros\n(0.31%), with the States, Japan and\nWest Germany not even appearing in\nthe top 20s list. The principle is\nsimple; the richer nations have more,\nand therefore give more.\nFeature FELIX, Wednesday June 24th198723 Image vs Reality\nAgricultural development: A major\nstep towards ira dic a ting hunger\nand malnutrition.\n\"The UN is dominated\nby Third World\nNations which try to\nuse it against the\nindustrialised world\"\nIn reality, developing countries are\ninadequately represented in the\nSecretariat, as they occupy 42% of\nprofessional posts. The aforementioned misconception seems to\nstem from two main factors: Firstly,\nthe one country, one vote system in\nthe General Assembly actually allows\nthe position of developing countries\nto be represented even if, due to many\nof these countries being non-aligned,\nthe overall vote of the General\nAssembly does not necessarily\nsupport Western views on political\nissues. (Note that a different voting\nsystem operates in the Security\nCouncil, with China, France, the\nUSSR, the UK and the USA having\nveto power). Secondly, poorer\ncountries have since 1974 been calling\nfor the establishment of a New\nInternational Economic Order; this\nwould change present unfair patterns\nof world trade, which consistently\nbenefit richer nations at the expense\nof the poorer ones, and thus aid their\ndevelopment efforts.\n\"UN staff members are\noverpaid and\nover priv il edged\" The United Nations system employs\n50,000 people worldwide. The\nprofessional category, excluding\ndelegates from member countries, are\ninternational civil servants, and\nconsequently their salaries are\ndetermined by the member\ngovernments and the General\nAssembly, the reference being the\nUnited States Civil Service. A deliberate policy of providing higher\nsalaries is used as an incentive to\nattract high quality professionals,\nespecially as, more often than not,\nworking for the UN involves\nexpatriation.\nAs one would expect, all UN staff\npay taxes to their home countries\nthrough the UN, and only delegate\nand high-ranking professionals are\ngranted diplomatic immunity.\n\"The UN is virtually\npowerless\"\nThe role of the UN in international\nrelations has been the main target of\nanti-UN criticism for years. The fact\nthat warfare, injustice and blatant\ndenial of human rights still persist in\nthe world is equated with the failure\nof the United Nations to fulfill its\ncharter. This attitude is based on the\nassumption that the UN is a world\ng over ment, endowed with sovereign\npower to enforce actions, which it\ncertainly is not. Its member states\ncommitted themselves to the charter\non joining the UN, and its respect is\ntheir duty; whether they chose to\nfulfill their duties is beyond UN control. In this context the main role\nof the UN is as a forum where\nnegotiations between countries\u2014even\nthose engaged in warfare\u2014can be\npursued and peaceful solutions to\nconflicts found. On a multitude of\noccasions, such as the Berlin crisis in\n1948-49, the Cuban missile crisis in\n1962, or the Middle-East crisis in\n1973, the organisation has\nsuccessfully intervened in potentially\nexplosive conflicts; it seems the UN will again have a role to play in the\nresolution of the latest Gulf crisis\nbetween the USA and Iran.\nIt can never be over emphasised that\nthe United Nations is a human\norganisation and is no less prone to\nhuman error than any other\ninstitution.\nDespite this, the UN works, and its\nwork is invaluable. Where it seems\nto have failed miserably is in\ncommunicating its achievements to\nthe general Western public, which, as\na result, is mis-informed and\nindifferent. Several reasons have been\nput forward to explain this\ninformation gap; firstly UN activities\nin the developed world are not as\nfundamental as in the Third World,\nand hence are less visible; examples\nbeing the standardisation of agricultural produce quality or the\ncleaning up of the Mediterranean.\nFurthermore, UN activities tend to\nbe long-term projects and hence lack\nmass-media appeal.\nThe problems the world faces today\nextend beyond national scope to\nencompass humanity as a whole. It is\nmore vital now than ever that a collective conscience is raised and\ncountries collaborate closely to\ncounteract the present frightening\ntrends in the world today. The United\nNations was created to fulfill this role\nand it is equipped to do so, but above\nall it needs the support of all its\npeople. In the words of former\nSecretary, Genera! Kurt Waldheim:\n\"...the public image of the United\nNations and the way it is viewed in\nthe world at large is important, for\nwithout popular understanding and\nsupport it will be difficult, if not\nimpossible, for governments to make\nthe United Nations work.\" Reducing adult illiteracy in\nColumbia.\nSundiatu Dixon-Fyle\n\n"

In an effort\nto find out what normal people do,\nyour intrepid FELIX reporter dressed\nup as Norman Bates' mother and\nsupplies the following suggestions.\nLondon, as usual, is best off with\nactivities and theatres and cinemas\nand parks, with jazz concerts on at\nthe Barbican such as Count Base on\nthe 9th July, and also the Beatles\nplayed by the LSO on the 18th and\nGershwin on the 19th July. The Royal\nShakespeare Company are\nperforming a Romeo and Juliet in\nmodern dress where Tybalt comes on\nstage in a red sports car, and Niamah\nCusack plays Juliet, to rave reviews.\nMacbeth is less enthused about, and\nonly lasts until July 4th anyway, and\nRichard II with Jeremy Irons in the\ntitle role is also on until July 8th. Someone suggested Ronnie Scott's in Frith Street W l as a fab place for\na night out, but it is exorbitantly\npriced in entrance, food and drinks\nand the chatter of the punters ruins the\nmusic, so why not go to Tottenham\nCourt Road Tube for a cool night\nlistening to jazz. Alternatively the\nNotting Hill Carnival, August 30th and 31st,11am to 9 pm or thereabouts, will supply anyone's needs in music and visuals with the\nusual floats and bands, described by\nits organisers as \"grand and large\nscale\". It starts from Ladbroke\nGrove.\nSummertime\nand the livin' is easy\nFish are jumpin'\nand the cotton is high\nYour mamma's rich\nand your papa\nhe's good look in' So hush UV baby\ndo-ow-own't you cry\nCheapo classical music can be\nheard at the Proms, held right next\ndoor at the Royal Albert Hall during\nthe summer months, with tickets at\ndirt cheap prices for those prepared\nto squat on the floor and maybe queue\nfor a couple of hours. Also in\nLondon, in June, the V&A are\nopening the new Pirelli Garden\nwhich rumour has it will be\naccompanied by music (well they\nhave to spend the entrance money on\nsomething, though at least they could\nhave bought flower pots for the\nflowers instead of old tyres).\nIf the weather is fine then Regent's Park Zoo and the nearby open air\ntheatre are interesting\u2014the Zoo costs\n\u00a33.50 and is well worth it for a day,\nthe threat re costs \u00a35.50, \u00a34 or more\nand is performing A Midsummer\nNight's Dream, Bartholomew Fair\nand the Two Gentlemen of Verona.\nIf it rains you can re-book tickets.\nThere are also open air concerts held\nat Kenwood House near Hamstead\nHeath, and the London Tattoo at\nEarl's Court from the July 8th to\n31st \u2014you know, the one where they\npretend to carry the field guns over\na river.\nThe Royal Academy of Arts is\ndisplaying paintings by amateur and\nprofessional artists from August 6th to 23rd. You can get in for \u00a31.70 with\nyour student union card and try and\nspot the ones by Prince Charles.\nThere is all sorts of artistry; sculpture,\noils, watercolours. From July 10th there is an exhibition of old masters,\nand on 20th September there is the\nBurlington House Antiques Fair\n(two-fifty to anyone else, but to you,\ng uv, one seventy) where old things\nare auctioned and I was assured that\nmuch of it will go for less than \u00a350\na throw.\nFor the rest of the Isles\u2014well\nstarting at the top and working down,\nthere is of course the Edinburgh\nFestival and Fringe, graced by the\npr sence of Theatre West End, which\nlasts from August 9th to 30th. It is\ndifficult, nay impossible, to get\naccommodation in Edinburgh at the\ntime, so it would be wise to sort it out\nnow. The Edinburgh Tattoo is held\nbeneath the castle in the second week\nof August.\nGlascow boasts a new art gallery,\nthe Burrell Collection, which people\ncome from as far afield as Germany\nto see, and if you're still bored, why\nnot visit Hadrian's Wall? It's big\n_no ugh, you can't miss it.\nThe Youth Hostelling Association\nhas hostels all over the UK at the\nlovely prices of \u00a34 outside London\nand \u00a37 in London, plus \u00a36 pa\nmembership, and the Ramblers also\noperate all over the country with\norganised walks and advice.

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198738 If you feel lost without Fido or\nTibbies, why not get a plant? Plants\nhave many advantages over animals\nas pets\u2014they don't for example wake\nyou up in the middle of the night, rip\nyour wallpaper or need cleaning out.\nIf you get bored with your plant you\ncould even eat it (providing it is not\npoisonous).\nHaving decided to keep a plant, the\nfirst thing to do is to choose what it\nis you wish to grow. If you want to\nbe able to eat it eventually, it is\nusually best to choose an edible\nvariety. Since apple trees tend to take\nup a lot of room, many people decide\nto grow mustard and cress. This can\nof course be grown in a wide range\nof amusing places, like used\neggshells, lecture notes and other\npeople's carpets. More adventurous\nplant lovers could try sewing a row\nof lettuce along their windowsills or\nattaching runner bean strings to their\nwardrobes but permanent damage to\nfurniture should be avoided if at all\npossible (even if it is in the name of\nhorticulture).\nAs many students have discovered,\nthere are many interesting plants\nwhich one can grow without a large\ninitial capital outlay. One of the more\nsuccessful of these which I have tried\nis the orange plant. For best results,\nthe pips should be soaked in water for\na week and put in the fridge for a similar length of time. They should\nthen be transferred to a pot of soil,\nkept in an airtight plastic bag in a warm dark airing cupboard and left\nuntil the shoots are about a centimetre\nlong. At this stage they can be put in\na light airy position.\nOther 'plants for free' include\nacorns, carrot-top ferns and potatoes.\nIt may be necessary to obtain soil and\na suitable container, but the cost of\nthis is usually within the budget of\nmost people. Another possibility is\nthe growing of 'cultures' of fungus or\nmould, for example in old, unwashed\ncoffee cups. The method may be\nlearned from any 'genuine' student.\nThe eventual washing up of such cups\nis thought to be the origin of the\nphrase 'culture shock'.\nOf course, a serious plants person will be inclined towards more\nextravagant undertakings. The choice\nis very wide. A trip to any nursery\n(and there is a very good one on the\nEarl's Court Road) will reveal a wealth of attractive pot plants and\nseeds. There are annuals, perennials,\nflowering plants, foliage plants and\nso on, to choose from. Anything from\na poinsettia to a pansy will make an\nexcellent pet plant. If you are feeling\nrich, spider orchids can be grown\nwith surprising ease in normal room\nconditions. If you wish to grow such\nunusual plants, however, I would\ndefinitely recommend that you invest\nin a good plant book, as it is important\nto get the soil and other conditions\nright.\nAnother interesting development in\nplant-growing is to find unusual\ncontainers. It is now somewhat old hat\nto put a herb garden in an old\nVictorian sink, but why stop at such\ntame receptacles? Metal should be\ntreated with caution as it tends to rust,\nand don't forget to ensure your plant\nhas adequate drainage (this is helped\nby lining the bottom of the container\nwith broken plant pots, for instance).\nCardboard boxes have obvious\ndisadvantages, but anything plastic is\nworth considering. There was once a craze for melting old records and\nbending them to form plant pots, but\nThe Day of\nthe Triffids\nPippa Trout\ndon't play them any faster than 33 %\nrpm once the plant is in the pot. One\nsuggestion I have is to line a drawer\nor even a used grapefruit tango can\nwith a plastic bag. Alternatively, you\ncould try decorating a standard plant\npot with paint or anything else that\ntakes your fancy.\nOnce one has a plant well\nestablished in a satisfactory container,\none should turn one's attention to\nmaintenance and long-term plant care.\nThe most important thing to\nremember is to water the soil. Exact\nwatering requirements vary from\nplant to plant, but as a general rule,\nthe plant will appreciate room-temperature water whenever the soil\nstops feeling moist. Many plants\nrequire less water in the winter\nmonths. The plant will also benefit\nfrom being transferred to a larger\ncontainer (with enough soil to fill up\nthe gaps round the edge) when its\nroots just show through the drainage\nholes in the bottom of the container.\nWhether to use fertiliser or insecticide\nis a rather contentious issue:\npersonally I prefer the 'organic'\napproach, which has the added\nattraction that, in general, you simply\nignore such complications.\nOccasionally I like to pour weak tea\nover the soil instead of water,\nespecially in the case of ferns, but the\nuse of herbicide is to be discouraged.\nFinally, to one of the most widely\ndebated aspects of plant growing, one\nwhich causes emotional reactions in\nmany people. This is, of course,\nwhether one should talk to plants or\nnot. It seems that the plant will benefit\nfrom this treatment, because when\nyou are talking to it you come close\nenough to see whether it needs\nwatering or is being eaten by various\nnas ties for example. I definitely\nadvocate giving pot plants names as\n-I feel it strengthens the emotional ties\nand bonding between plant and\ngrower. The disadvantage is that one\ntends to be rather more upset by the\nplant's ill health or death. However,\nrather than pontificate any more I will\nleave you with a final thought from\none of the great philosophers of our\ntime: Whether or not you talk to your\nplant, the important thing is to listen.\nAlumnus\nDay\nA lot of people have passed through\nthis place\u2014some 60,000 of them are\ncurrently believed to be amongst the\nquick. It is strange\u2014but the College\nknows of the whereabouts of fewer\nthan half our alumni\u2014perhaps fewer\nthan a quarter. We would like to\nknow where they all reside...\nThe Alumnus Office has been\ntrying to remedy this state of affairs,\narmed with a few PCs, a large hard\ndisk, willing hands and much\nenthusiasm. It is up-hill work\u2014but we\nare getting there. We want to know\nthe Imperial College alumni\u2014be they\nthe class of 1986 or 1926, their advice\nto us can be invaluable. Besides which\nthey all gave three years of a critical\npart of their lives to study here; many\nhave an a tru al curiosity to see what\nhas happened to the place these 12\nmonths, these sixty years.\nAlumnus day is our first coherent\nattempt at meeting Imperial College\nalumni en masse. At this, our first\nattempt, the mass may not be that\nlarge\u2014but will probably approach\n1000 people. I believe that their\nprimary interest will be to visit their\nown Departments\u2014all of which will\nbe \" open\" from 2pm to 7pm. there\nwill be tea on the Queen's Lawn, (it\nnever rains on 7 July) music from\nstring quartets, a talk by the Rector\nin the Great Hall at 5.30, for all of\nthose who have done too much\nstanding, supper in the Beit Quad (it\nnever...), and much else.\nPostgraduate students will be much\ninvolved in demonstrating in their\nown Departments and with the other\nactivities. All Imperial College\nstudents who happen to be around are\nwelcome to participate\u2014to visit\nDepartments\u2014including some that\nthey may never before have\npenetrated. I hope that you will be\nkind to the visitors\u2014remember that\none day you will (I hope) be one of\nthem...\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY' S GARAGE( Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE\nMEWS\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 581 1589\n\n"

    "content": "Sport FELIX, Wednesday June24 th198729 From the pen of a man barely alive, scribbling furiously in\na remote corner of the FELIX office, /\"t's... THE BARON\"I think I 'll do this tomorrow\", said Rabid Bones,\nthe F ALIX Editor, as he sat in his office watching\nhis staff slaving away over paste-up boards. It was\n3.30 in the morning, there were only two days to\ngo before the publication of the last F ALIX of the\nyear, and Rabid had spent the last four days trying\nto think of the first line of his editorial. Rabid\nalways liked to write something that he thought was\ndeep and meaningful in his editorials because it\nproved to him how clever he was. This was quite\nimportant for Rabid, who had nearly got thrown\nout of Cheapskate school and had only been\nawarded an \"also ran\" certificate when he left. In\nfact Rabid never wrote anything deep or meaningful\nin his editorials; instead he would write out a hundred lines of \"I don't like Arthur Michael\". Most of the citizens of Cheapskate were not at all\ninterested in who Arthur Michael was or what he\ndid all day, but this did not stop Rabid writing about\nhim at every opportunity. The only thing which\nRabid thought was more interesting than Arthur\nMichael was the fact that he was a homosexual.\nNearly every editorial Rabid had written contained\nat least half a column on why it was a good thing\nto be a homosexual.\nRabid did not want to have to write his editorial\nin a hurry this time. He thought that if he spent\na long time thinking about it he would be able to\nwrite lots and lots of deep meaningful things about\nhow Cheapskate was not a nice place, and how all\nthe teachers at Cheapskate school did not know how\nto teach. Funnily enough, the rest of the citizens\nwere not interested in the teachers at Cheapskate\nschool. They all knew that none of the teachers\ncould teach, but they decided not to worry about\nthis too much.\nNow Rabid had decided to put off writing his\neditorial for another day. The rest of the staff\nthought that this was very silly, and that it would\nbe very nice if Rabid got everything done in time\nfor a change, so that they would all be able to go\nto bed before midnight.\nRabid sighed and thought back at what had\nhappened that day. Earlier he had been to the\nCheapskate \"Happy Families\" party, which Derek\nDash and Mad Dash had held in their back garden.\nMad Dash had ordered all the Baron's men from\nthe Surefield fortress to dress up in silly clothes\nand smile a lot at all the small citizens. Johm\nSecretary was particularly upset about this. He had\nhad to put all his belongings in a wheelbarrow and\nsell them to the crowd, one by one. John Secretary\nthought that this was a very bad thing, but it would\nhave been alright if he had not had to chase away\na lot of F ALIX photographers who kept wanting\nto put red ping pong balls on his nose. He was also\nvery cross because Derek Dash was not wearing\na silly outfit, and so Derek did not have to put up\nwith all the very small citizens pointing at him and\nlaughing. John Secretary had been laughed at for\nat least two hours now, and was cheering himself\nup by thinking of all the Surefield minions whose\nlives he was going to make a misery. At the end\nof the afternoon he had begun to feel much better,\nhowever. Mad Dash had persuaded Derek to play\nhis violin as music for a small citizen's party game.\nDerek had played the violin so badly, though, that\nall the small citizens had been too busy laughing\nat him to play the game properly.\nThe \"Happy Families\" party had been a great\nsuccess. All the important citizens had been there\nas they were all too scared of Mad Dash to say no\nwhen she asked them if they would be able to help.\nThe citizens' bouncer, Gutters, had been there all\nafternoon, though he had spent most of that time\nfrightening all the very small citizens with his\nbeard. Cheapskate's chief cook McNorthy had been\nthere as well, selling more of his burgers to\neveryone, and trying not to swear at any of the\ncitizens so that everyone would think that he was\na nice person really.\nRabid lean t back in his chair and tried to think\nof something nasty to write about all the people who\nlived upstairs in the citizen's office. Rabid had\nwanted to write something nasty about Ms Plague\nand Mummylonglegs all year, but was too stupid\nto think of anything, after another two hours he\nfinally began to put pen to paper. This is what he\nwrote...\n' 'Dearie me'', thought Mrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks to\nherself as she looked around the citizens' office and\ndowned her sixth glass of sherry. ' 7 hope Whygate\nisn't going to be in there much longer. He's been\nspeaking to Ms Plague for three hours, and I haven't had a chance to tell him how I want him\nto do his job next year yet\".\nMrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks was worried. She was\nthe citizens' manager, and had been doing that job longer than anyone in Cheapskate could remember\nEvery year she had to teach a new set of head\ncitizens what they were supposed to do, and every\nnow and then there would be a head citizen who\nwanted to try some new ideas. Normally Mrs Jolly\nHockey-Sticks would let them try a new idea, as\nlong as they came to ask her if it was okay first.\nNone of this year's new group of head citizens\nhad come to ask her to tell them what their jobs\nwere, however, and Whygate, the new head citizen,\njust spent all his time looking through the citizens'\nold scrap books trying to memo rise each page. At\nthe moment Why gate was in Ms Plague's office,\ntalking to her about how good he was in bed.\nSuddenly the telephone rang; it was L Capone, the\nCheapskate Rent Collector. L Capone was always\ncalling Ms Plague because she knew that she would\nalways take her side in arguments with Arthur\nMichael. Ms Plague told Whygate to go and\npractice his joined up writing, and settled down to\na nice long chat with L Capone.\nThe Cheapskate Rent Collector was a devious\ncharacter. She had tried to persuade all the citizens\nto vote for Simon Willy, one of her favourites, in\nthe election for head citizen. When one of the\ncitizens pointed out that the election was nothing\nto do with her, since she worked for the Baron, L Capone had threatened to scream and scream until\nshe was sick unless the naughty citizen apologised.\nNevertheless, she always managed to get Ms Plague\nto do what she wanted and spent most of her time\ntelling Ms Plague and all the other citizens what\na hard job she had, and how much work she had\nto do. Ever since she took over as Rent Collector\nshe had been recruiting a select band of citizens\nto help to \"clean up Cheapskate\"...\nRabid read what he had written. As usual, it was\na load of rubbish. He picked up his red pen and,\nfor the last time, crossed everything out.\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Wednesday June 24th19878 The Taig Interview:\nI met Christine Taig, ICU President,\nfor an informal chat in the Union\nLounge Bar on a Sunday lunchtime.\nI started off by asking whether she\nhad enjoyed the past year?\nYes, I have enjoyed it very much.\nWhich doesn't stop me thinking that I can't wait to go. I would do it again,\ndefinitely, but I wouldn't do it again next\nyear. But if I knew what I know now\nI would still do it again. It's very, very\ngood but also very, very frustrating.\nHow long do you feel it took you to\nsettle down in the job?\nIn different respects it took a different\namount of time. I'd say that after\nChristmas and a little bit into springtime\nI was actually beginning to work well\nmyself. One of the main problems I found was that the President has nobody\nto keep her going. I suspect a year ago\nJen (the Union Administrator) used to\ndo it hut she's been too busy this year\nto be keeping tabs on the President. It's very difficult to get your working\npatterns right, get to know the right\npeople, and know how to go about\nthings. But about half way into the\nSpring Term I began to get things done.\nWhat would you class as your major\nachievement of this year then?\nEverybody asks that! I'm really not\nat all sure. There have been several\nthings which have been fairly major. At\nthe start of the year \"Norman's\" was\ndone up, and it is now open in the\nevenings. The trade's not been\nabsolutely amazing but it is certainly\nbuilding up, and it's becoming more of\na regular meeting place. All that said I hope that it will carry on next year.\nThere are various projects with\nCollege which have only just been\nstarted, so there's no actual achievement\nto show for it: things like the Sports\nHall, which hopefully we will eventually\nhave, funded with money from\nHarlington. The JCR business is still up\nin the air, but I think that we have come\nout of that reasonably well. I think that\nthese are fairly major achievements, but\nof course they're not just mine. It's been\ndone very much as a team.\nYou've also been one of the people to\ndraw attention to gays at Imperial,\nand you supported Robert Daniel in\nhis appointed as Gay and Lesbian\nWelfare Officer.\nThat's something that I 've wanted to\nsay for the last four years. I do feel that's an achievement because we now appear\nto have a Gay Society which is going to\nkeep going. For various reasons I 've\nbeen personally involved with people\nwho have come out on the wrong side\nof some of the homophones at this place\nand when I stood for President one of\nthe supposed insults that was hurled at\nme most often was \"Bloody Lesbian\".\nDid you find it difficult deciding\nwhether to openly support Gay rights?\nWere you glad that Robert Daniel\ncame forward in the first term?\nI was very relieved, even though I had\nmentioned the subject to start with and\nI had seriously considered trying to start\nsomething up myself. But I thought it\nwould be wrong coming from me. It\ncould have been seen as something that\nI was just trying to do for the glory of\nit so I was very glad that somebody came\nforward. As far as speaking out went,\nby the time I had got to that stage I was\nfar more confident and was prepared to\nsay something. I know that people would\nhave spoken about me behind my back\nas they have done before; some of the\nrumours that have come back to me have\nbeen very vicious indeed. But to be quite\nhonest I don't give a shit as they are\nobviously not the sort of people I want\nto bother myself about too much. On the\nwhole the support has been tremendous.\nDo you know any of the results of the\nrecent Welfare Survey?\nMmmm....That was started by\nsomebody who, for one reason or\nanother, can't really finish it. It was\nhanded over to Lesley (Gillingham, ex-College Welfare Advisor) to tidy up. But\nnow Lesley's job has changed noone is\nin a position to do it and enthusiasm for\nit has died down. I know that Pippa\n(Salmon, incoming ICU Welfare Officer)\nis very keen to find out what's really\ngoing on with it over the Summer. I 've\nlooked through an awful lot of the replies\nmyself and found many of them quite\ndepressing because they do indicate that\na lot of IC students are the type you\nwould expect\u2014very moral, hardworking and hard-drinking.\nDid you find any surprises?\nNot really. In some cases they didn't take it seriously, which I think is a shame. I accept that when something like\nthat comes through the door, it's hard\nto see what relevance it has.\nDoes the apathy of the student\nmajority depress you?\nYes and no. The main route of\ninvolvement is always going to through\nthe clubs and sports. But then again an\nawful lot of those people don't seem to\nrealise that the clubs are part of the\nUnion. It's not the people who don't come to the UGMs who annoy me,\nbecause I can understand why they\ndon't \u2014if everything is ticking over\nnicely. They would turn up if College\ndecided to close down a department, or\ncourse work was increased drastically\none year. As long as things like that\naren't happening I suspect that they\nwon't be bothered, unless you\nmanufacture an issue for people to get\nworked up about\u2014which was effectively\nwhat happened with the 'Tie Clubs'\nmotion. It was supported by the people\nwho run the UGMs because they knew\nit would bring people in and a serious\ndebate would happen.\nThe JCR issue was probably the one\nmost directly affecting the Union\nbecause it does involve space that other\npeople were using and it does involve\nmoney for the Union. People did\nactually come out and support that very\nstrongly.\nThe people who depress me the most\nare those who seem to assume that\nbecause there are people in an office they\nwill do everything and nothing need be\ndone by anyone else. You end up with\na core of people who always help all of\nthe time. It's that thing about hacks again\nwhich everybody knows about. They are\nthe people who actually do the work but\nthey get run down for it.\nWe've heard many conflicting reports\nabout when the new Chemistry\nbuilding will be built. Apparently the\nUGC planned for it to be started in\neither 1988 or 1989 but the College\njust don't seem to have the money.\nI will be amazed when that building\ngoes up to be quite honest. Eric Ash (the\nRector) has said to me several times that\nthe biggest problem is going to be raising\nthat money. Of course it's much easier\nto find money for an academic building\nthan it is for halls of residence. So, I don't know.\nRecently it has been suggested that\nlectures should start at 8.30am. Do\nyou think that this is a good idea, and\nwhat do the College hope to gain by\nthis?\nI would have thought that it would be\nfeasible to introduce this from the\nstudent point of view. Whether they'll\nlike it or not I 'll come onto in a minute.\nWhat worries me is whether the staff\nhave been consulted; a lot of staff here\nlive even further away than the students\ndo and will find it very difficult to come\nin in the morning. Students will\nobviously find it very difficult: I certainly would have done! On the other\nhand it wouldn't have made much\ndifference because I never went to first\nlectures anyway.\nI think if it was brought in, that it\nwould have to be only introduced to first\nyears as they came in.
