    "content": "Scar a mou che the final problems\nPreamble\nHello, good evening, and welcome to the last Scaramouche puzzle\npage. As I wrote in my statement of intent two weeks ago I 've\nrealised that my duties as editor won't allow me time to write a regular puzzle column next year, so this is the finale to my two\nyears as FELIX puzzles editor.\nI always try to make the end of term puzzles a little harder than\nusual, but since this is my curtain call, the s worded puzzles on this\npage are real bastards \u2014 the cream of puzzles I 've rejected as far-too difficult to set before. Each carries a \u00a310 prize for the first\nsolution opened on July 1, but if the puzzle is unanswered by then,\nthe prize will be awarded to the first correct answer I receive. I anticipate handing out one or possibly two prizes on July 1, and\nthe others could well be unclaimed by Christmas! Unmarked\npuzzles are just for fun, as usual.\nThanks are due to everyone who has entered a puzzle, ever, but\nespecially to Jonathan Mestel (Grey Spider), Anna O 'Donovan,\nCharles Bailyn, John Conway, Steve Marshall and the ever\ngenerous Pete and Will at Mend-a Bike for sponsoring us and for\nmending my tandem so quickly, so often.\nFinally, we still have a vacancy for next year's puzzles editor.\nAny volunteers ? Good luck with the puzzles, and may the\nrate of change of momentum be with you.\nScaramouche\nye an' Part, c^ ly after%^ fsf \u00b0P fi\n\u00ab\n\u00b0 \" ^ occ aS IO*e SUr pr's e \u00b0 nast* an* outsider n' you may recall P*\"y offers of help?\nFoul Fare\nI felt it would be unfair to start next year\nprejudiced against the college refectory\nservice without actually eating there, so yesterday I took David Rowe, the Phoenix\nEditor, and Peter Rodgers, the handbook\nEditor, to lunch in Mooney's; today Peter is\nill with food poisoning. The menu read as follows, and we each had one dish from\neach section:\nMinced Beef Roll : 60p Sausage To ad:75p Kidney Tur be go:90p Baked Beans : 15p Cauliflower : 30p Green Beans:45 p Pilau Rice:30 p Mashed Potato : 45p Boiled Potato : 60p Peter is too ill to tell us what he ate, but\nDavid remembers that at the checkout he\npaid \u00a31-35, Peter paid \u00a31-20, and I paid\n\u00a31-50. This information, together with the knowledge of what we two ate (including, I may say, the least app et ising boiled potatoes I have ever seen) enabled us to unmask with complete certainty the dish\nwhich laid Peter out.

Well, it happened again.\nWhether out of simple carelessness, or whether because it\nwas assumed no one would ever want to play such a dreadful instrument, I can't say. Nevertheless, the Baby\nGrand is once again wedged right in at the back of the\nmusic store with all kinds of assorted impedimenta\nblocking the way to the door.\nI'm sure you remember the rules: there's no room to\nrotate any of the instruments without risk of damaging\nthem, and nothing may be removed from the cupboard\nexcept the Baby Grand. Your task is to get the Baby Grand\nout of the cupboard. (If you do it the most efficient\nway - and you won't it takes exactly a hundred moves.\nAny solution, though, is admissible for a prize).\nWhich\na' on tr nrt u...,JU Jn fe rent d cards.\n's tri but j or diff,\nd if. \u00b0ns of th\ndriest\nnd\nPossible\nat\nauction?\n>s the\n^Banana's Revenge\nIt's been quite a while since Wodge played\nchess against his Banana microcomputer.\nIt's rather an old model, and although it\nalways plays legally, there is a certain\nbizarre streak in its tactical planning.\nAnyway, last week Wodge was rummaging through some junk in his study\nwhen he found the machine at the bottom\nof a cupboard and in a mixture of pity and\nnostalgia he played a few games on it,\nbeating it easily every time.\nThen he tried an interesting experiment: he set the machine playing itself, with\nremarkable results. The opening move\nwas conventional enough-white advanced the king's pawn two squares. But\nfrom then on the game was wildly\nunpredictable and came to a dramatic\nfinish when Black, on its fifth move,\ncaptured a White rook with one of its\nknights, thus giving checkmate.\nCan you reconstruct the whole game?\nt Letters& Figures\nDear Amble\nI 've just had a letter from Crumble and\nDrudge.

I'm afraid it wasn't particularly\ninformative for me personally,\nbut that is because I too was\nat the meeting, so I knew it all\nalready.\nI didn't really feel Miss\nFreeman's account was comprehensive enough, it failed to\npoint out the juicy bits, such\nas: why is the National Deaf\nChildren's Society Rag's main charity? Because the\nRag Committee enjoy the\nkiddies party and they know\nthey can get collection licences\nif it's for the ND CS( that's how I understood the a rgu ment). Frankly, I find those\nreasons secondary in the\nargument; more important, I think, is where the money\ngoes, and yes I did suggest the\nmoney go to a charity in the\nThird World, where the same\nmoney can have a far greater\neffect. The meting thought\nthat the ND CS was worth-while, because for a mere\n\u00a3200 someone can have his\nhearing restored; but for\nabout \u00a310 someone in India\ncan have his sight restored!\nOther important issues\ndiscussed were: should the\nRag Mag have a glossy cover?\n(This is because it drastically\nincreases the cost of printing.)\nThe two reasons given for not\nchanging it were that they\nwould keep better, so we\ncould show our grandchild ren!( chuckle, chuckle). Secondly, people are more\nlikely to buy a copy if it looks\ngood; but because the Rag Mag has made a loss (for two\nyears running?) the price may have to be raised to 50p. If the content is not going to\nbe improved. Then it doesn't deserve a glossy cover, and if\n50p, it won't sell as easily,\nno longer feel it necessary\nto put forward constructive\n.ideas, such as suggestions for\ncharities, because Rag receives enough letters from\ncharities, pleading for money:\nall they have to do is read\nthrough them!\nI hope that this information\nwill have been of some use to\nMary Freeman and others.\nTours sincerely\nGraeme Shaw\nDear Mark\nI see from Nick Morton's letter ( FELIX617) that he is\nacting true to form. As soon as\nhe had doled out a couple of\ninsults he promptly passed the\nbuck; truly the height of inspired leadership.\nOf course the Halls are not\nkeen to be involved in a central laundry. They arc-perfectly happy with the\npresent system; indeed, many\nresidents find it hard to\nunderstand how anyone could\ncome up with such a shortsighted idea as scrapping the\nlinen service.\nIt is not so much myself\nwho is concerned about those\nother, lazy students; the\ncleaners in Southside have\nexpressed their concern about\nthe deterioration in hygiene\nwhich would result from the\nremoval of the linen service. I am reliably informed that as\nmany as ten percent of\nresidents cannot even be\nbothered to strip their beds\nand leave the dirty sheets to\nbe collected for the sake of\nhaving clean linen, how the\nsupposedly knowledgeable Mr Morton can expect them\nto actually wash and iron their own sheets every week is\na matter of pure conjecture.\nIf Nick can't lick the\nRector's boots enough to get a job as a member of College\nstaff, he ought to apply to the\nTreasury, where his apparent\ntotal lack of accounting knowledge would be well received. If the Halls upgrade\ntheir present laundry facilities,\nconsiderable capital expense\nwill be incurred; Mr Morton obviously cannot understand\nthat this will come out of\nresident's pockets. A further\ncharge which he has conveniently \"forgotten\" (if he ever\nthought of it in the first place)\nis the cost of residents supplying their own sheets, either by\nhiring them at suitably commer ical rates, or capital\noutlay of purchasing them.\nHe will no doubt claim that\nstudents living elsewhere have\nto provide there own sheets,\nbut so what? Some students\nlive in beds its infested with\ncockroaches, but is, Nick suggesting that vermin be\nintroduced to Southside just\nso that everyone is equal?\nApart from the extra costs\nmentioned above, there is the\nvery important consideration\nof time and inconvenience.\nWe are supposedly here to get\nan education, not to wash\nsheets. No one in their right\nmind( this clearly doesn't include Mr Morton) can honestly believe that washing\nand ironing a pair of sheets a week takes no time at all.\nThere are more important\nthings in a student's life than\nmoney, Mr Morton, and the\nextra effort and inconvenience are not- worth the cost of\na pint of shandy each week.\nIn answer to his final point:\nrepresentatives ol the residents\nof Southside were waiting to\nchallenge the President's report at the U GM and AGM when those whim ps from Soc\nSoc, who seem to care little\nfor the Union that funds\nthem, brought the meeting to\na close.\nJasper\nPS: I hope that you were\nconcerned about student opinion during your\" holiday\" in Ireland.\nDear Mark\nEveryone's always writing\nto you about Morton's cock-ups. Well, after much in depth research I can now\nreveal to your readership that\nthis is just the area where he\nhas failed, this year. My suspicions were first aroused\nat the time of the attack of\ngerman measles. Ms Lindsay\nwas across from Ireland at the\ntime, being seemingly wound\naround Mr Morton at all possible times. Yet she failed\nto contract the dread disease.\nPerhaps the proximity was\nnot so great?\nBeing thus sorrowed in love\nMr Morton turns to pastures\nnew. I must admit it was a stroke of genius persuading\nMr McCabe to resign simply\nso that she'd always be where\nMr Morton could easily reach\nher (Ms Teller of course), and\nall seemed to be going well\nuntil the startling truth was\nrevealed within the pages of\nthis very newspaper. In FELIX616 the two stated\nthey were \"not opposed to sex\nin principle\", suggesting that\nin practice it was just not\ngoing on!\nIn desperation we see Mr Morton running back to his\nold love. But even after a week in Belfast he returns rosy\ncheeked and wide awake! Bad\nluck Nick!\nTours, hoping for improvement\nnext year\nNick Pyne\nDear Sir\nAs this academic year draws to a close I would like\nto pay tribute to someone who\nhas done so much to enrich all\nour lives here and in doing so\nhas become one of the best\nloved College personalities. I refer, of course, to the FELIX Editor Mark Smith.\nHis journalistic talent is\nsuch that he has been able to\nmove us to tears of laughter or\nof outrage with a single apposite sentence. His pen has\nbecome a mighty sword scything the self important down to size and puncturing\nthe pompous. His quicksilver\nwit has made Friday mornings\na time ol laughter and happiness with stall and students\njoining together in shedding\ntears of mirth. Yet between\nthe lines we can glimpse the\nmassive intellect which lies\nbehind the print, the man\nwhose editorials make Bernard Levin seem amateurish and confused. Mark Smith and first class journalism, the two are synonymous.\nOn this occasion I feel it\nonly right that I should now\nreveal my true identity to the\nworld. It is:\nHer Royal Highness\nQueen Victoria\nBuckingham Palace\nLondon\nGalactic Sector 7\nTours\nCossar\nFELIX, June 18, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "\u00bb\nPeace for Galilee\nThe utmost Israeli\nhy pro cris y By a Palestinian student\nThe Middle East, over the past two weeks, has\nbeen experiencing another outbreak of death\nand destruction in what seems to be a never\nending struggle between Arab and Israeli. The\nIsraeli invasion of Lebanon has so far resulted\nin an estimated 10,000 people killed, mainly\ncivilians, and more than 600,000 people have\nbeen made homeless. At a time when Israel\nclaims to be a missionary of peace, it has\nattacked another country' s integrity by\nbombing Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak, has\ndefied world opinion by annexing the Golan\nHeights, has breached international law by\nbuilding even more settlements on the\noccupied West Bank (en housing as many as\n35,000 Jewish settlers), has opposed the basic\nfundamentals of human rights by denying the\nPalestinians the right to return to their\nhomeland (when the Israeli Law of Return\ngives any Jew in the world the immediate\nfacilities to settle), has enraged human sentiments by using live ammunition on Palestinian demonstrators in Jerusalem and in\nthe West Bank (when foam was used to evict\nIsraeli settlers from the Sinai settlement of\nYamit), and has invited worldwide criticism\nand disapproval by committing yet another\nact of aggression against the Lebanon. (In\nMarch 1978, 30,000 Israeli soldiers crossed the\nborder into Lebanon, seized a six mile border\nstrip and installed puppet Lebanese major\nSaad Haddad as its ruler.) At a time when the\nvictims of the Israeli assault (mainly Lebanese\nand Palestinian civilians) face certain death\ndue to the lack or insufficiency of medical\nsupplies, the United States vetoed the United\nNations Security Council's draft resolution\ncalling on Israel to withdraw its forces from the\nLebanon. The resolution would not have made\nany difference any way (since over 300\nresolutions have been passed against Israel\nsince1948 none of which have been implemented) but such an action is irresponsible, the US being Israel's main supplier of\naid and military equipment. As for the\nunfounded Israeli claim that their military\noffensive is directed towards preventing the\nPalestinian shelling of the Israeli settlements, it\nshould be noted that the ceasefire proclaimed\nin the area, and which lasted for almost ten\nmonths, was only breached by the Israeli\ncontinuous bombardment of Lebanese villages\nand Palestinian positions prior to the invasion\n(the Guardian and The Times, June 10 1982)\nand was met by retaliating moves on the part\nof the armed forces of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganisation (PLO).\nThe recent outbreak of war in the Lebanon\nis only a development of the state of affairs\nwhich has in the past been responsible for\nthree major wars which have claimed hundreds and thousands of lives. At the crux\nof the whole Middle East problem lies the\ninescapable question of Palestinian identity.\nThe Palestinians, a friendly and peace loving\npeople in nature, have been the victims of a series of tragic historical incidents which have\nleft them in an insecure and defenseless\nposition. Many of them became refugees living\nmainly in the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. The Palestinian diaspora came about in 1948 as a direct result of the\nestablishment of the state of Israel. For years\nand years, the question of a Palestinian homeland was left in the hands of the United\nNations and the SuperPowers who only\nexploited the situation to gain interests in the\narea.\nMeanwhile, Palestinian national consciousness grew to a high level and their national\nidentity was a dominant theme of their everyday life. All their daily problems of\nsurvival\u2014finding work, food or shelter, arose\nfrom the fact that they were exiled by the\nIsraelis from their homeland. Political organisation was initially difficult due to the\nfact that the Palestinians dispersed, but the\nPLO was later established to embody political,\nnational, social, cultural and educational as\nwell as military organisations( such as\ncommando groups, trade unions, professional\nassociations, etc....). The PLO took as its duty,\nthe right of confirming the Palestinian identity\nand of ending the degradation and sufferings to\nwhich the Palestinians have been exposed.\nThe PLO has right from the start gained\npopular support from the whole of the\nPalestinian people who saw in it the means of\nregaining their lost but not forgotten identity.\nThe PLO has representative offices in over 60\ncountries including Britain. The PLO has\nalways sought towards finding a political\nsolution to the problem and in 1974, the\nchairman of the executive council of the PLO, Yassar Arafat, called for an establishment of a secular democratic state in Palestine (Israel)\nwhere Arabs and Jews could live in peace side\nby side. Most of the Palestinians accepted the\nidea of a secular state, but sadly the Israelis\nrejected it. By this time, the PLO had become\na strong political force in the area.\nThere has been an observed moderation in\nthe policies of the PLO over the past few\nyears. This moderate trend has now been\ndestroyed by the Israeli aggression. The PLO leadership was contemplating a peaceful\nsolution to the conflict and the establishment\nof a Palestinian state in the West Bank and the\nGaza strip, but Begin has recently referred to\nthe West Bank as \"Western Eretz Israel\" thus\nreviving the revisionist notion that the\n\"historical land of Israel also included the east\nbank of the river Jordan\". These Zionist beliefs\nof expansion have presented a major stumbling block whenever attempts for\nreconciliation were made. The invasion of\nLebanon and the pounding of refugee camps\nwill undoubtedly radical is e the policies of the\nPLO, and Palestinian feeling is that armed\nstruggle might prove to be the only way to\nliberate the Palestinian homeland from a vicious and uncompromising enemy. It is\ndifficult to see how Israel, in its widely\npublicised search for peace, could resort to\nsuch means of death and destruction unless\ntheir idea of peace is that of constant war and\nof oppression against the Palestinian people as\na whole.\nThe Israelies claim to have launched their\n\"Peace for Galilee\" attack on the Lebanon in\norder to prevent guerilla attacks on Israel. It is\nnow obvious that this has been used as a pretext in order to deliver yet another blow to\nthe independent and free presence of the\nPalestinian people as formulated through the\nPLO. The underlying objective of Israel is to\nimpose the autonomy rule on the Palestinian\ninhabitants of the West Bank by creating an\nalternative leadership other than the PLO. Israel has been \"losing the grip\" over the\noccupied territories and its 1.1m Palestinian\ninhabitants, as demonstrated by the recent\nuprisings in Jerusalem and many other West\nBank towns and villages. On top of this, a recent poll carried out in the West Bank by an\nIsraeli public opinion research organisation\n(PORI) for Time magazine concluded that\n98.2% of the Palestinians on the West Bank\nfavour an independent Palestinian state and\n86% of the population said that they wanted\nthe state run solely by the PLO( Time, May 24,\n1982). So, the Israelis invaded the Lebanon in\norder to destroy the PLO as a political and\nmilitary force in the area in an attempt to\nfrustrate the Palestinian people in the West\nBank into finding alternative representation.\nPrevious attempts to do so (such as deposing\npro PLO mayors) proved unsuccessful.\nHeavy civilian casualties have been the\ndirect result of Israeli shelling of the Lebanese\ntowns and villages. In their venture the Israelis\nhave increased the grievances of the\nPalestinian people and this in turn will lead to\nmore violent outbreaks and to guerilla attacks\nby the Palestinians on Israeli interests within\nand perhaps outside the boundaries of Israel.\n(The PLO in its desperation might be pushed\nto revert to its early tactics of hijacking,\npolitical assassinations, etc..) The Israelis are\nnot destroying a \"few terrorist pockets\" that\nendangered their daily livelihood but they are\ntrying to put an end to a national movement of\na people who are struggling for self-determination within a political situation that is\ndriving them into desperation. Ironically, the\nJews have in the past faced that same situation\nyet they refuse to identify with the aspirations\nof the Palestinian people. The persecution of\nthe Jews in Europe has ended but that of the\nPalestinians has started. Israel has proved to\nbe a large concentration camp for the\nPalestinian Arabs who are continually harassed, imprisoned and tortured for\nexpressing\" unfavourable\" political views.\nCollective punishment has been directed against Palestinian nationalists and their\nfamilies, books have been banned, houses\nwere demolished, land has been seized, newspapers are subjected to heavy censorship,\ndemonstrators have been shot, all of which\ncharacterise the Zionist aspect of the State of\nIsrael. The Palestinian struggle has been\ndirected towards ending this oppression and to\nthose who are fighting for the realisation of this\naim the following tribute is presented:\nA word to those who died\nFor the twins Lebanon and Palestine\nA word to those mutilated by the war\nAnd to those renewing the title of refugee\nOnce more and with no end\nTo the people who take suffering\nWith their daily bread\nTo the people that stood\nAgainst terror and oppression\nTo you all I say these words:\nYou are the new Gods\nAnd with your blood\nYou shall write a new testament\nIn the history of mankind\nYou are a consolation\nTo the oppressed of every nation\nYou are a curse on tyrants everywhere\nAnd if I were to worship any Gods\nI will worship you\nFor you are the real Gods of Justice\nAnd I beg forgiveness\nSince my biggest sin is living\nWhen thousands of you are dead.\nFELIX, June 18, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "We shall not\nbe moved?\nThe proposed move of the Union to Southside\nThe announcement of a proposal to\nmove the Student Union from its\ncurrent building in Beit Quad to the\nSouthside Halls was undoubtedly the\nmost startling news of the year.\nComing, as it did, late in May, there\nhas been enough time to form an\ninitial view of the project.\nUnion President Nick Morton first hinted\nat a possible major change for the Union in\nhis annual report. Under a section entitled\n\"Morton's Mystery\" he said:\nMorton's Mystery\nI thought I would put this in here to check how many\npeople really read the whole report. There is a scheme of major importance to the Union under\ndiscussion in College It may come to light during\nmy term of office or it may be left to next year's executive.\nFrom the tone of this paragraph it is\nobvious that the scheme had originated in\nCollege and Mr Morton gave the impression\nthat he was not a party to the discussions.\nSubsequent to the announcement it was\ndiscovered that the Union President was\nfirst approached by College Secretary John Smith in March of this year tor his views on the idea. Mr Morton gave an enthusiastic\nresponse and also promised not to reveal\nthe idea to anybody until more details were\navailable, including plans i or the conversion.\nThis he did and it was not until May21 that word of i he move first leaked, only four\ndays before the ICU Annual General Meeting. This effectively meant that the\nstudent union could not hope to take any\nform of decision on the matter and would\nhave to wait until October before respond\ning.\nIn the meantime ICU Council have\nmandated the Executive to investigate the\nplans further and the College authorities\nhave a few months to arrange more detailed\nproposals.\nThe Plans A i present the move would be initiated in\nJuly 1983 when conversion work on the\nlower levels of Southside would begin. This\nwork would continue over a two year period\nand gradually the Union would be moved\nout of its Beit Quad building and over to the\nnew site.\nThe current Union Building would be\npartly taken over by the Life Sciences Division to expand first year laboratory\nfacilities and the upper floors would almost\ncertainly be used as a post experience centre. This facility would include conference rooms and luxury accommodation for visiting industrial managers on short\ncourses. It would supposedly run at a profit\nand is part of a push for closer cooperation\nwith industry.\nCentre point\nCollege Secretary John Smith is the moving\nforce behind the whole idea. He has been\nconsidering the possibility of a post experience centre for some time; possible\nsites have included a new building above\nthe sports centre and the space beneath the\nSouthside Halls.\nWhen interviewed by FELIX Mr Smith\nexplained that he had been concerned about the large, under-utilised space below\nSouthside for a long time. He said that the\nareas were so large that the obvious use for\nthem was as facilities for the student union.\nThe vacation of the current Union Building\nwas an \"added bonus\" in his view and he\nwas at pains to express th.it the possibility\nfor increased space for the Union was the\nmotive for his proposal. Other advantages\nwere that a \"focal point of student activity\"\nwould be formed in Princes Gardens and\nthat moi e people from Halls would make\nbetter use of the Union.\nReliable sources in the Sherfield Building\ngive a different view. Most of the College\nadministration were surprised by the' proposal, as it was well-known that the\nSouthside basement was a probable site for\nthe post-experience centre. Indeed, the\nareas had been inspected and detailed estimate for conversion prepared. These\nturned out to be far more expensive lhan\nexpected and it is this which may have\nprompted Mr Smith's unexpected generosity. Funding the Move When asked about the cost of the move Mr Smith commented \"I'm not talking about\nchicken feed. Something in the region of a quarter of a million pounds.\"\nIt was not made clear whe i her this is the\ncost of converting both buildings for their\nintended use or just Southside, but in either\ncase the source of such a sum is uncertain.\nMr Smith could not (or would not) tell\nFELIX who would pay for the move. He simply said \" the College has ways and\nmeans of raising such amounts\".\nAn allocation would have to be made in\nthe 1983/4 College budget, which means\nthat the Union would have to make a decision by January of next year. However,\nit is almost certain that under the present\neconomic climate the Universities Grants,\nCommittee ( UGC) would not fund such a move. It is more likely that the College\nwould he forced to take out an expensive\nloan, the interest on which would un doubt ably affect the Union's allocation for\nquite a few years.\nA Realistic Estimate? A more interesting point is the accuracy of\nthe cost estimate. Assuming that a full\nCollege Secretary John Smith CBE, the\nman behind the Union relocation plan.\nconversion of Southside is planned, with\nsomething more substantial than plasterboard partitions and some fairly major\nstructural work, the cost will un doubt ably be much higher. FELIX consulted an architect for his opinion. He said that he\ncould not give a concrete estimate for such\nwork, but commented that \u00a3250,000 was\n\"unlikely\" t< cover a conversion of this type.\nHe added that the present plans looked like\nthey'd been \"knocked up overnight\" and\ngave little indication of the ex ten l of work\nnecessary. As well as lit is we must consider\nthat building work invariably costs more and\ntakes longer than expected.\nThus it seems likely that corners would\nhave to be cut lo save money.\nWhose decision? The summer months will be used to look\nmore closely at the scheme, and we will\nhave to wait until next term to voice our\nopinion as a body. Already it is clear that\na large section of the student body are in\nopposition. Many life members who have\nbeen approached about the scheme are\nfurious that the Union could consider moving from familiar surroundings. More importantly, many current students are\nunconvinced that the move will result in\nan improvement of facilities indeed, the\nmaior it y think the reverse may well happen.\nThe extent to which student opinion will\ninfluence the College is uncertain. Whilst\nJohn Smith maintains that he would not\ncontinue in the face of widespread student\nopposition, there is really very little time\nfor this to be expressed. AUG M could\nnot realistically discuss the hazy plans which are currently available, and full\nproposals could be held just out of our\nreach until it is too late.\nOur move What is clear is that the student union\nshould make a firm decision at the earliest\npossible opportunity, even if the college\ndoes not give further details. Nick Morton may agree 'in principle' with the idea, but\nwe must show whether students do too.\nFELIX, June 78, 7982\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEW OF THE YEAR FAIRLY EVENTFUL YEA\nIC UNION CAUGHT NAPPING!\nGuess what, folks? Yes, it's that Hall! Photo: Jane Williams.\nIf the powers that be intended 1981/2 to\nbe a good year at IC they certainly made\na very poor start. Union officers and\nCollege employees alike made a series of\nerrors in the romantic, patriotic and riot-torn summer that created extra work for\nthemselves, hardship for some, and a source of amusement or indignation for\nmany others.\nHall Hell\nOne of the most trouble-ridden aspects of\nCollege life this year has been the\npostgraduate Hall of Residence in Montpelier Street. Purchased last August the Hall\nsuffered from poor heating and lack of\ncooking facilities and communal areas. The\nlatter was particularly important in view of\nthe small size of the rooms.\nAlthough residents received a rent rebate\nof \u00a320, they were paying the highest rents\n(\u00a323pw) for College residence at the time\nand since then a serious case of dry rot has\nset in, which will cost at least \u00a316,000 to\nrepair, in addition to the discomfort the\nrepair will cause. The residents were also\nshabbily treated by the Union President\nNick Morton who on two separate\noccasions was reticent to support their\ncomplaints after they had written to Student\nServices.\nPersonal Attacks\nTwo publications edited over the summer\nput the Union in a lot of trouble when Nick\nMorton read the paste ups but \"failed to\nnotice\" some of the more controversial\narticles. The ICU Handbook had originally\ncontained vicious personal attacks on\nVictor Mooney and Captain Lindley, but\nthese were removed at the printers.\nHowever the Rag Mag was published iri its\noriginal form and dominated Union General\nMeetings in the autumn term (and kept\nthem quo rate). Originally City & Guilds\nUnion refused to sell the magazine because\nthey objected to some of the jokes. ICU\nCouncil then passed a motion restricting its\nsale to IC students, who later voted to\ntotally ban the magazine. Unfortunatelywhen this decision was reversed in\nDecember, street collecting licences had\nnot been obtained, the Rag Chairman\nresigned, and with the exception of the Rag\nFete, Rag activity stopped for the year.\nThe notorious partition in the Lower\nLounge was built during the summer and\nwas part of a \u00a32,500 re decoration scheme\nwhich included re carpeting the Lounge. The\npartition was the idea of former Deputy\nPresident Barney McCabe and met with\nwidespread opposition for a number of\nreasons. These included the cost, the\nreduced floor space, the lack of consultation\nwith the appropriate Union committees and\nthe increased opportunities for vandalising\nthe games machines, which were to be kept\nbehind the partition.\nResignation\nMr McCabe was to meet with further\ncriticism during his time as Deputy President because of his \"laziness\" and\nnonchalant attitude towards his work. This\nresulted in motions of censure at both\nCouncil and a Union General Meeting\nbefore it became obvious that the games\nmachines were running at a large loss. This\nand the low turnover from the Southside\nShop led to his resignation and replacement\nby Christine Teller.\nRag Mag Editor Patrick Coll passes a motion of his own.\nViolation\nIn the first week of the session four\nbrass lamps, worth \u00a3500 were stolen from\nGuilds inviolate mascot Bo. In March Guilds\nhad to retrieve their violate mascots\nSpanner and Bolt, after they had been\nstolen by RCS seven weeks previously.\nRCS also violated Reggie (Kings College)\nand Mary (Queen Mary College) while their\nmotorised mascot Jez appeared on Blue\nPeter and on German television.\nMike, the mascot of ICU, was stolen from\nthe Union Office in May after being left\nthere by Nick Morton and Honorary Secretary Marco Ledwold in an alcoholic\ndaze. Since a ransom note has not been\nreceived the matter may be reported to the\nPolice.\nCelebration\n1981 was also the centenary of the Royal\nCollege of Science. The fortnight of events\nin November included lectures by Nobel\nLaureate Lord Todd (Chemistry Past and\nPresent), Prof G.J. Whitrow (Personalities\nand Achievements in RCS) and Prof B.S. Hartley (RCS leading into Biotechnology).\nThe guest at the Centenary Dinner and Ball\nwas Prof Sir Andrew Huxley, President of\nthe Royal Society and Nobel Laureate.\nThere was also an exhibition of College\narchives material organised by Mrs Pingree,\nthe College archivist.\nSoon after the centenary celebrations had\nended a working party examining the\npossibility of a merger between IC and\nQueen Elizabeth College reported that the\ncolleges should form \"an association with\nthe intent of a merger at a later date\".\n\n"

    "content": "This year seems to have slipped by quicker\nthan it takes to erect and demolish a partition.\nAt the end of a sabbatical year as FELIX Editor it seems appropriate (for some reason)\nto look back and assess the Union's performance. Besides that, it is my last chance\nto say the things I 've been meaning to say all\nyear.\nThe College\nIt would be all too easy to fabricate stories\nabout gross cock-ups and the waste of money\nat Imperial College. But I really don't have to.\nI have always been surprised that one of the\nworld's top educational institutions, can at\ntimes be run so badly. The College authorities\nare in theory the guardians of our welfare.\nTheir job is to ensure that we receive an\nadequate education in our chosen fields and\nthat we have reasonable facilities for living,\neating and recreation. They are paid to do this\nand nothing else.\nWhat do we get? After four years at IC I think that on the academic side we are treated\nfairly well. Most undergraduate courses are\nreasonable, although the workload on some\n(particularly engineering subjects) is a bit\ntough. I can't vouch for PCs but I'm sure the\nsituation is not too bad.\nApart from this we have a mixed deal.\nBecause of the size of the College we are\nafforded fairly generous Union facilities, but we\nsuffer from having an abysmal refectory\nservice (which sinks further into the depths\nevery year) inadequate residence facilities and\nwe're hampered by bumbling administrators.\nRefectories\nI 've not really indulged in petty personal\nsniping at Victor Mooney and his cronies, but\nthe one thing in the forefront of my mind which\nabsolutely reeks of inefficiency are the\nrefectories. Mr Mooney takes the attitude that\nFELIX digs up stories about him and his work\nwhen there is nothing else to do. This is not so,\nbut he uses this as a shield and has become\nhardened- to criticism over the past twenty\nnine years.\nDuring my four years at College I 've seen\nthe refectories go from being appalling to\nabsolutely appalling. There are a captive\nclient elle( in more ways than one!) of over\n4,000 students, all of which want to eat\nreasonable food at decent prices. Mooney\nprovides neither and instead of improving\nfacilities he now takes the novel approach of\nclosing them down. I realise that he has a hard\njob and probably attempts to work very hard,\nbut after twenty-nine years of failure he should\ncall it a day.\nI'm not a catering manager and can't offer\ncomplete solutions, but I'm sure some young\nblood could. So pack your bags Vic and retire.\nCaptain Lindley\nTalking of which Mr Mooney' s superior\nCaptain Lindley( Domestic Secretary) is\nretiring at Christmas (see news page).\nThose who were here last year witnessed\nthe emergence of Captain Lindley into the\nlimelight. My predecessor had a great deal of\nfun at his expense and succeeded in showing\nhow awful senior administrators can be. All of\nthe criticisms of old Salty are, to a certain\nextent, justified and he typifies the breed of\nCollege administrator who believes that IC\nwould run perfectly if it wasn't for the\nstudents. The S her field Building seems stocked up with quite a few of these characters\nand whilst I'm certain nobody really wishes the\nCaptain any bad will personally, we'd all be\nbetter off if he took a few others (including\nMooney) with him.\nContinuity\nThe great advantage which College have over\nthe Union is, of course, continuity. Union\nofficers are only elected for a year at a time\nand the College use their years of experience\nto full advantage.\nSome years can be pretty rough for the\nSherfield Building. If the President, or FELIX Editor for that matter, can shout loud enough\nand get the support of students, then the\nCollege can be forced into doing just about\nanything. Forced may sound bad, but believe me it is necessary when dealing with\nthe Sherfield Building. The problem is that\nmore often than not students are a disorganised rabble, most of which are more\ninterested in being deadly boring or getting\npissed than improving their lot.\nStudent Union officials often fall into this\ncategory\u2014either that or they're so afraid of\ngetting their fingers burnt that they allow the\nCollege to walk all over them. The best\nexample this year must be Nick Morton and\nthe proposed move to Southside.\nNick hasn't been a bad President, in fact on\nthe whole (despite some major differences of\nopinion) he has been pretty good. His problem\nhas been that he is far too good natured and\noptimistic to spot College pulling a fast one. As\nI 've said to him on many occasions, it is no use\ngiving a blanket approval for College schemes\n(like the Southside plan) because you're\nimmediately in a weak bargaining position.\nWhat sort of concessions can you gain by\nagreeing outright?\nAt the same time College Secretary John\nSmith can be likened to a foot in the door\nencyclopaedia salesman. I think it's quite\nobvious that the College would really like to\nget their hands on the Union Building to use as\npart of Life Sciences and a post-experience\ncentre and hence have come up with this\nmarvellous scheme. John Smith has successfully sold the idea to Nick Morton, claiming\nthat it was for the Union's own good that\nCollege want to spend \u00a3250,000 on the move\nand that the vacation of the present building is\njust an added bonus for them.\nIf there is no firm opposition to this idea\nthen the College will ease it through over two,\nthree or even four years without anybody\nreally noticing. Full plans, estimates of costs\nand so on will be held just out of our reach until\nit is too late\u2014\"The nature of the work is such\nthat we cannot tell you exactly that at this\ntime,\" we will be told and eventually the tide of\nCollege bureaucracy will convince the\nstudents union of two or three year hence that\nthe idea has already been approved and that\nthere is no turning back.\nI hope that if full plans are not available next\nOctober and if we cannot be certain that the\nCollege will deliver the goods (and let's face it,\non their record can we afford to take that\nrisk?) then you will all voice your opinions and\nmake sure we keep our facilities.\nThe Union\nMost students seem to take little interest in\nUG Ms and I can't blame them. I 've attempted\nto keep FELIX relevant to student affairs,\nconcentrating mainly on internal matters, but\nthe mass of irrelevant politically orientated\nmotions at UG Ms only serves to increase the\nboredom that the officers' reports inevitably\npromote. There is nothing wrong with noble\ncauses, but IC Union is hardly the United\nNations and some of the people who propose\nthese items could be better employed with\nsubjects a little closer to home.\nTo be quite honest I sometimes wonder why\nanybody gives a damn about the Union. So few\npeople take any real interest and it usually falls\nto them to sort out the mess others leave\nbehind. Coping with some of the moronic\nofficials from Sherfield is pure hell\u2014most\nnav vies would put them to shame in the\nintelligence stakes.\nBut despite all this there seems to be some\nrewards in working for the Union. The admiration of your fellow students isn't worth a tinker's cuss, but most employers recognise\nthat it is better to take on people who have\nexhibited a lively character and community\nspirit, rather than some of the dreary individuals who can do nothing but work. That\ndoesn't apply to many of you (thank God!) but\nas the employment situation has gotten worse\nthere has been a marked decline in parti-ci pati on. Nick Morton\nThis year's President has his faults, but I hope\npeople recognise that he's been a lot better\nthan most. His strength and weakness is his\ngood nature, which lays him open t to attack\nfrom people like me and also makes him trust\nthe College.\nNick has certainly worked hard for the\nUnion but I believe that his approach of\ncooperating with College (and keeping things\nquiet for long periods) is fundamentally wrong.\nWe cannot trust College to do anything\nwithout a little gentle persuasion and we have\nto maintain a bargaining position. They will\ntake advantage of inexperience and misplaced\ntrust at almost every opportunity so if you're\nnot told about anything by your elected\nofficials then it suits them fine. I hope that I 've\nmanaged to throw a few things into light this\nyear and also that you'll show an appropriate\nreaction.\nRemember that a little interest from a lot of\npeople can go a long way.\nThanks\nThere is far too little space to thank all those\npeople who have been of help to me\nthroughout my four years.\nFirstly thanks to the Physics department\n(especially Robin Smith and Brian Morgan) for\nputting up with me and to all those in R CSU in\nmy first year\u2014it was a great year.\nThis year's staff have been a great help:\nthanks to Peter Rodgers, Lesley Horrocks\n(who is still a mega-star), Pallab Ghosh, Martin\nS.

    "content": "FELIX gets through a great deal of news in a year but rarely follows any of it up as\n\"what happened then\" is seldom newsworthy. \"Bull terrier goes missing!\" will always\nbe more interesting than \"Bull terrier found!\"( Mind you, it depends where you find the\nbull terrier and who it belongs to!)\nHowever, on this occasion, just to abate your insatiable curiosity, FELIX will break\nwith tradition to follow up some of this year's stories that actually have a follow-up.\nTaken chronologically\nFrom FELIX August 7\nCle m,a yellow and black commercial lorry, the\nMines motorised mascot, is still in bits in the\ngarage, despite optimistic reports that it would\nbe back on the road by Christmas.\nFrom FELIX August 7\nThe Westfield College penguin mascot stolen\nby Barney McCabe has not yet been returned to\nits rightful owners. Shortly after its theft, it\n\"went missing\" from' the IC Union Office.\nWestfield College have not requested its\nreturn. Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of\nthe mascot.\nFrom FELIX October 5\nThe partition erected over the summer vacation by the then Deputy President, Barney\nMcCabe, which caused raised eyebrows due\nto its \u00a32,000 price-tag, is to be demolished over\nthe coming summer vacation. Proof that what\ngoes up must come down.\nFrom FELIX October 5\nThe wooden platform and scaffolding erected\noutside Weeks Hall to protect passers-by from\nfalling masonry is still evident. No action has\nbeen taken or is planned by the College Estates section responsible for the upkeep of\nHalls of Residence. Tiles and concrete are still\nfalling from the higher parts of Weeks Hall,\nwhich was evacuated for a long period several\nyears ago as the high-alumina cement of which\nit is constructed was passing through its most\ndangerous phase. However, despite the falling\ntiles, Weeks Hall is thought to be safe.\nFrom FELIX October 9\nThe antique lamps stolen from the City &\nGuilds motorised mascot Bo have never been\nfound. Insurance has been claimed but the\nlamps are unfortunately irreplaceable.\nFrom FELIX October 23\nThe Rag Committee's proposal to change the\nconstitution to require proofs of the Rag Mag to be approved by members of the Union\nExecutive has been passed. This is in order to\navoid motions to ban the Rag Mag's distribution proposed by some sections of the\nstudent community who strongly disapprove\nof the magazine's contents, as happened this\nyear resulting in only one third of the 10,000\nRag Mags being sold. Rag Committee's in com pet ance in selling it when the ban was\nlifted is also a major contributing factor to the\npoor sales. The Rag Committee are taking the\ndefeat est attitude of considering printing only\n5,000 Rag Mags next year as opposed to\nattempting to improve their own sales\nefficiency.\nFrom FELIX Nov13& Feb12 That \"awfully embarrassing refectory flat\" has\nnot been converted to Union showers or\naccommodation, as proposed by John Smith\nCBE, the College Secretary. Mr Smith has\nswept the matter under the carpet and the flat\nis still as empty as it has been for the past six\nyears.\nFrom FELIX Nov20, Dec4& Jan 22\nThe proposed merger between IC and Queen\nElizabeth College is now most definitely off. It\nwas learnt last week that in fact Kings College\nis to merge with QE C. From FELIX November 27\nThe decision to ban all Rag collections for fear\nof prosecution as ICU do not have any street\ncollection licences still holds. The Rag Committee have still not managed to obtain\nany licences and it seems unlikely any will be\navailable for next year.\nI' ROVERS YIN EDU l Brlxlti\nout ot n Wi I corr oct ii studenT\nCollege to take blacks without A levels College Is tierce with about eight\nstudents chasing every place. They\nFrom the Daily Mail, Monday November 30 1981.\nFrom FELIX December 4\nImperial College is not going \" to take blacks\nwithout A Levels\" any more. The Daily Mail\ndevoted considerable space to the decision of\nthe College to show positive discrimination\ntowards underprivileged ethnic minorities as\ncalled for in the Scarman Report. The College\nhas recently quietly shelved the scheme. Peter\nMee, the College Registrar, has pointed out\nthe obvious difficulties that would be faced by\nsuch students who lacked a good grounding in\nscience. The scheme might have worked for\nArts students, he added, but science and\nengineering is too demanding.\nThis begs the question as to why the College\never decided to take students without A Levels\nin the first place. Token support for the Scarman Report for cheap publicity, later to be\nabandoned when S carman was forgotten,\nperhaps?\nFrom FELIX, January 15\n\"For God's sake grow up,\" Dr Paul Jowitt was\nurged by FELIX for his pettiness in requesting\nhis student Southside Penthouse neighbours\nto use the stairs instead of the awfully noisy lift.\nDr Jowitt has still not grown up.\nFrom FELIX January 22\nThe lunchtime lecture program organised by\nthe Humanities Department has been saved\nfrom the axe. Lectures will continue as normal\nnext session; the H.G. Wells Society will be\npresenting three of the lectures after a kind\ninvitation from John T hole, the lecture program organiser. The three Union lectures\nare entitled: (1) Sex; (2) Drugs; (3) Rock'n 'Roll.\nFrom FELIX January 22\nThe College has taken over control of the\nUniversity of London nuclear reactor, situated\nat Silwood Park. This was a recommendation\nof the S winner ton Dyer Report on the reorganisation of the University of London.\nFrom FELIX February 5\nThe thief who stole money from gas meters in\nseveral College flats in Lex ham Gardens has\nnever been apprehended.\nFrom FELIX February 12\nThe \"Supplies to Poland\" organisation formed\nin College has become the non-event of the\nyear. After initial enthusiasm from many\npeople including the Rector Lord Flowers, the\nproject eventually fizzled out. Perhaps a mite\ntoo ambitious.\nFrom FELIX February 19\nIt will come as no surprise to learn that STOIC Cameraman Glyn Garside of Elec Eng 2 failed\nby mammoth proportions to be elected as\nLabour candidate for the Knightsbridge ward\nin the London Borough elections on May6. From FELIX April 30\nThe scheme to add \u00a310 to every Hall resident's bill in order to support the Sick Bay has\nfloundered. No method of raising the \u00a317,000\nper annum required to keep the Sick Bay open\nhas been agreed upon. The Sick Bay looks to\nremain in a healthy state next year but faces an\nuncertain future the year after.\nFrom FELIX May7 No word has been heard of the IC Union\nmascot, Mike, a large 1701b micrometer, since\nits theft on May6. No ransom demands from\nother colleges have been received. If Mike is\nnot found by the end of this term the incident\nwill be reported to the Police as a theft, even\nthough the mascot is \"violate\", meaning it is\nintended to be stolen. But who would want a large micrometer?\nFrom FELIX May21 The controversial scheme to house two students in what are presently Weeks Hall\nsingle rooms has been scrapped.\nThat's all, folks! Perhaps you can see why\nmost stories are never followed up.\nFELIX, June 16,1982\n\n"

    "content": "The Taming of the Shrew by William\nShakespeare. Presented by the New\nShakespeare Company and directed by\nRichard Digby Day. Open Air Theatre,\nRegents Park.\nThe production of The Taming of the Shrew\nwhich opens the season at the Open Air Theatre in Regents Park is almost too\ncolourful and too comic to describe in words.\nIt just simply has to be seen. The action takes\nplace in Padua and Verona but the- director,\nRichard Digby Day, has set the play in newly\nliberated Italy at the end of the last war, with\nvery minor alterations in the text.\nAmong the hilarious assortment of\ncharacters therefore, are various American\narmy chaps and a superbly comic gum chewing helmeted GI played by Paul Raffield '\n(as Biondello).\nThe amorous passions of several of these\ncharacters are brought to the boil by two very\nbeautiful women: Katherine, a haughty Italian\ngoddess played by Kate O'Mar a, and her more\napproachable sister, Bi^nca, played by Janet\nSpencer-Turner (the sight of whom alone\njustifies the cost of the ticket). The ill-tempered\nKatherine is per sued by the almost mad dandy,\nPetruchio, played by Christopher Neame, and\nit is the strange alchemy that allows Petruchio\nto transform Katherine from a prickly unwanted woman to an obedient and noble\nwife that essentially provides the quintessence\nof the play. The delicious comedy of The\nTaming of the Shrew exposes great streaks of\nviolence and roughness, however.\nThe outstanding characteristic of apparently\nall productions at the Open Air Theatre is the\nalmost perfect choice of players to fit the parts;\nin many cases this could not possibly be\nbettered. The theatre is a vastly under estimated establishment both from the artistic\nPetruchio (Christopher Neame) taming \"The\nShrew\" (Kate O 'Mara) at Regent's Park Open\nAir Theatre.\npoint of view and from the sheer enjoyment\nvalue obtained, and it is indeed a very lucky\nthing that the theatre was saved from closure\nat the end of last summer. (The Arts Council,\nwithdrew its grant but subsequently replaced it\nafter bowing to public pressure. This contrasts\nwith the GLC who doubled their contribution\nin the last two years and are now the theatre's major supporter.)\nThis year is the theatre's Golden Jubilee\nSeason and as with past season, two Shakespeare plays and works by Bernard Shaw\nare on offer. This summer sees The Taming of\nShrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream by\nShakespeare, interspersed with a Shaw double\nbill consisting of The Dark Lady of the\nSonnets and The Admirable Bashville.\nThe usual refreshments and gastronomic\ndelights are available this summer: soups, hot\ndogs, salads, cakes, hamburgers, Bratwurst\nsausages, strawberries, raspberries and ice-cream. The wine bar serves the traditional\nRegent's Park specialities including mulled\nwine (delicious) and Puck's Fizz, joined this\nyear by 'Shrewdriver' and 'Petruchio Punch'.\nThe bar, barbecue and buffet open two hours\n\" before the performance and the bars remain\nopen till midnight. This, and the magnificent\nsetting of the theatre in a leafy green hollow in\nthe park and an enchanting classical building\nat the rear of the natural stage which is\ngradually lit up as the evening sun sets behind,\nmakes virtually any trip to this theatre a superb evening out.\nThe Australian Dance Theatre, Sadlers\nWells Theatre, Roseberry Avenue\n(nearest tube: Angel).\nThe Australian Dance Theatre began their\ntwo week season at Sadlers Wells on Tuesday\nwith a programme of four works.\nBeginning with Labyrinth, a disturbing work\nbased on Greek myth, they continued with\nBroken Head, an equally disturbing but\ningenious work, with music by Brian Eno.\nFlibbertigibbit, an enchantingly quirky ballet\nwas followed by the evocative and beautifully\nchoreographed Transfigured Night.\nThe season, which is well worth seeing,\ncontinues at Sadiers Wells as follows:\nJune 15,19,26: Labyrinth, Broken Head, Flibbertigibbet, Transfigured Night.\nJune 16, 21, 22, 23: Winter by Spring, Paradigm,\nImpromptu, Stars End.\nJune 17, 18, 24, 25: While We Watched.\nF eK xfe Ticket ( fc a boisterous new comedy about young people growing up I FELIX in association with Twentieth Century Fox invites you to a special\npreview screening of Porky's at the Odeon\nMarble Arch at 11:00pm on Friday, July 2.\nTo obtain your ticket apply in person at the\nFELIX Office, Beit Arch.

    "content": "Dear Sir\nI was flabbergasted with\nthe two letters published last\nweek concerning the Falkla,nds. I could take their pathetic and unconsidered\narguments apart, one by one.\nHowever, I will not waste\nyour time or mine in doing so\nas, unlike Mr Shaw, I do not\nunderestimate the intelligence\nof IC students and know that\nthey will see the straight through the left wing shit that\npours from his mouth without\na moment's thought.\nTours sincerely\nPaul Simion\nDear Mark\nOr should I say \" Dear Fiona and Graeme\" as I am\naddressing this mainly to\nthem, re their letters of issue\n617. Both obviously disagree\nwith our liberation of the\nFalkland Islands. I won't go\ninto the history yet again, but\nwould like to make a few\npoints.\nI must assume that both\nletters were written before\nGoose Green and Darwin had\nbeen liberated but, even so, I must take exception to Graeme\nShaw's questions.\n\"Couldn't the Falklanders\nhave suffered the presence of\nthe Argentinian troops for a couple of months while negotiations were in progress?\nSurely it would be less inconvenient for them than a war?\"\nI suggest he puts those same\ntwo questions to the inhabitants of the above settlements,\nwho had been locked up for\nover a month, one of them in\nshackles, while their homes\nwere ransacked and their village filled with leaky napalm bombs and unstable\nammo dumps. Their reception\n' of the Paras clearly shows\nwhich option they preferred.\nNot forgetting the people who\nare incarcerated in the detention camp at Fox Bay.\nWhilst I agree with both of\n, them, and the Pope, that\narmed conflict is no way to\n: settle disputes, I must remind\nthem that it takes two to\nnegotiate, but only one to start\nlighting (and they started).\nWe have been negotiating\nwith Argentina for many years, which is hardly \"always\nrefusing\" is it Fiona? We have\nalso been trying to negotiate\n(plus the imposition ol sanctions) since before the Argentinian invasion took place\n(Resolution \"502\" was passed\nbefore April 2) to ask them to\nleave. Have they left? No they\nhaven't, and have continued\nto build up in the mean time:\nflouting \" 5 0 2 \" for the past\ntwo months.\nBoth cite the case of Northern Ireland and the people\nwho wish to be part of the\nRepublic, they both forget\nthat the majority of Ulster's population, as do all (but one)\nof the Falklanders, wish to\nremain British. They should\nnot be ignored either.\nJust because the UK may\nhave been less than perfect in\npast doesn't give Argentina the\nright to walk into any territory\nthey desire (including parts of\nChile and Antartica). But,\nwhile on the subject of empires, many of the Commonwealth of Nations are\nbacking our sanctions, whilst\nothers remain neutral. So\nwhilst our empire may have\nnot been perfect, many who\nwere part of it do not wish to\ndissociate from us, so we\ncan't be all bad.\nIt is not hypocrisy to feel\nsorry for those, and their\nrelatives who have died. Nobody in their right mind\nwants a war, but there arc\ncases where it may be the\nlesser of many evils. If blatant\nannexation of territory and\noppression of people, is\nallowed to proceed un res trained, there is no knowing\nwhere it will end up. The Second World War started by\nHitler getting away with Austria, Czechoslavakia and\nPoland.\nFinally, it is worth noting\nthat the Falklands prior to\nApril 2 were comparatively\nundefended. Argentina marched in with 10,000 troops as\nopposed to 30 marines and\n1,800 inhabitants. This must\nsurely explode the myth that\njust because a place is un defended then nobody will\nattack it. This, as has WW2, and many other conflicts\nthroughout history, shows\nthat the opposite is true: If\nyou' re undefended, and someone wants to invade,\nthey will do so. History has\nalso shown that you can talk\ntill you're blue in the face, but\nthe invader will not leave.\nThis does not mean, however,\nthat you mustn't try, there is\nalways hope. But in the end if\nthey will not leave after being\n\"spoken to nicely\" they must\nbe \"shown the door\", and in\nno uncertain terms if necessary. Phil Merryman\nDear Sir\nHas Margaret Thatcher not yet realised that she\nwould have saved a lot ol time\nby \" nuking\" the \"Falvinas\"\noil the bloody map in the first\nplace?\nThis would have resolved\nthe tricky problem ol handing\nthe Falklands over to Argentina without popular uproar\na problem that has baffled\nsuccessive British governments\nover the years. It would also,\nI understand, have saved the\nlives of many more \"first\nclass\" British citizens than\nwhat has now ensued.\nOf course she would still\nhave to think of a way ot\nhiding her disastrous home\nand economic policy but I'm sure John Nott or Lady Di can come up with another\nbrilliant plan.\nTo finish, had she done this\nI'm sure we all realise the\nworld would have been a much Salter place with people\nliving in mutant harmony.\nAnyway the French discovered the stupid things so\n\"rend aere Caesare qua e sunt\nCaesaris\", (mi spelt), what?\nTours\nB Durodie\nPhysics 2\nPS: Maybe Paul Holt'could\nsit on a cruise and shout\n\" Rule Brittania\" as it lands.\nSmall Ads\nPentax KM SLR camera with f1.4 standard lens and case, as new, \u00a3 8 5\nContact S, Marshall, c/o FELIX Office.\n\u2022Sam Smith's beers at 50p per pint\nfirst hour of Tuesday and Thursday\nevening sessions.\n\u2022 Freshers Fair forms are due in\nTODAY.

    "content": "Have you seen our mascot?\nMike is the mascot of Imperial College Union, a large replica of a micrometer weighing 170lbs. Mike went missing in the early\nhours of the morning of Thursday, May 6, 1982.\nSo far no news of its whereabouts has been received nor any\nransom demanded. The mascot is violable and as such it is\nexpected that other colleges will attempt to remove it. However,\nif no news of its whereabouts is received by 5:30pm, Friday,\nJune 25, then the incident will be treated as theft. The Police will\nbe called in to investigate and this could lead to a prosecution.\nAny news of its position, present, or since May 6 should be\nforwarded to Marco Ledwold, Imperial College Union, Prince\nConsort Road, London SW7.\nA cautionary tale\nBeware of Moonies\nI arrived at the bus station in Denver after\nseven weeks working and travelling in the\nUSA. Dishevelled, tired and a little fed up with\nAmerican and Americans, I booked a room at\nthe Y WC A intending to find a job to see me\nthrough the next two weeks before travelling\non to California.\nAs I gathered my bits and pieces together\nand worked out the route, a young guy walked\nup to me and asked if I needed any help. His\nname was Ross and we chatted for a while\nabout my travels and life back in England. He then explained that he was from an Intern at ional Community in Denver called UNI CAP( Unification Community Action Programme). They had an English lecturer\nworking with them and would I like to come\nback for dinner and meet them all. I said \" You are not those dreaded Moonies, are you?\"\nwhereupon he smiled and said no, just a Christian community doing voluntary work. I went back in the transport provided to an\nordinary looking house where I was greeted\nenthusiastically and made to feel very welcome. The programme commenced with\nus standing in a circle, singing a song, introducing ourselves one by one and a moment of prayer or silent meditation before\nbreaking for dinner. After dinner the members\nput on a little entertainment before the leader\nof the \"family\" as they called themselves,\nspoke about the ills of the world and invited us\nall (about seven new recruits) up to their house\nin the mountains to hear how they were trying\nto change them. We were shown some slides\nand during the refreshments that followed,\nthey all tried to persuade us individually to go\nup. I refused but they put me up that night (a sleeping bag on the floor as they always slept),\ntook me to the employment agency the next\nmorning, showed me around the city and\ninvited me back for the same programme only\nthis time I decided to go up to the mountains\nwith them. \"Not much happens in Denver,\"\nby Linda Pearce\nthey said, \"you might just as well come up to\nour house for the weekend and see something\nof the rockies.\"\nWe were woken next morning at 7:30 by a song and went out onto the mountainside to\ndo some exercises and sing a few songs. There\nwere about five new members but we were\nnever left alone to talk and were accompanied\neverywhere by a member of the group. Every\nmealtime each new recruit was asked to\n\" share\" something about themselves until\neventually, inner-most secrets were divulged.\nEvery evening supposedly confidential \"reflections\" were written and read by which\nmethod the group new exactly what the recruit\nwas thinking. It seemed churlish and bad\nmanners to refuse to do as asked since the\ngroup were so enthusiastic and nice. Each day\nwe had three, three-hour lectures, with a long\nhike at lunchtime and games inbetween and in\nthe evening. Each moment was regimented\nand there was never a moment of privacy, not\neven in the bathroom. The last lecture on\nSunday evening divulged their belief that the\nMessiah was on earth followed by an emotional testimony from the group leader\nand another singsong as happened before and\nafter every meal. The leader and my spiritual\nparent (Ross) immediately came over to me\nafterwards and urged me to stay for another\nfive days to hear more about their beliefs (after\nall, who wants to have missed the messiah). I agreed to stay, along with four others.\nThe following week( and two weeks afterwards) pursued the same pattern save we\nhad two lectures and did housework or\nwood chopping in the extra time available.\nDuring the week I asked twice more who the\ngroup were and both times they denied they\nwere Moonies. On Friday, the seventh day, it\nwas revealed that the leader of the group, and\nby implication the Messiah, was Rev Sun Myung Moon. I was shocked but they justified\nthe deception by the fact that no one would\nstay if they said outright who they were\nbecause of their bad press. They called this\n\"heavenly deception\" in the belief that the\nends\u2014whether money or recruits\u2014justifies\nthe means.\nFive weeks later, having spent two weeks\npicking up rubbish, fundraising or recruiting, I phoned home and told my parents that I was\nstaying in America to work for God. They flew\nout the next day believing I had been kept and\ndrugged but soon found out the brainwashing\ntechniques employed and hired a de pro grammer on arrival. It was five days before\nthey could locate me by getting my sister to\nphone from Germany to verify I was in the\nMoonie house and phoning them in a call box\naround the corner, early Monday morning. At9:00 am my father simply walked into the house\nas we were all standing in a circle introducing\nourselves. 1 believed that he came for the day\nand left with him promising to be back at 4:00.1\ngot into the car they said they had hired and\nwe went for a two and a half hour drive\n\"sightseeing\", had lunch, then called into the\ndrivers 'office'. They then announced that this\nwas in fact a deprogramming and the two\nguys\u2014'trainee drivers'\u2014were security men. I was talked to for about six hours by the\nde programmers and an ex-Moonie. By that\ntime I decided I did not want to return but\nneeded to find out who was speaking the truth,\nthe Unification Church or the de programmers. The next day I was whisked off to rehabilitate\nfor a week in Virginia where I slept for three\ndays and read all about the cult. Then I returned home to my studies which I have\nnow, two years later, completed.\nAll in all it was quite a traumatic experience and not one I would wish upon\nanyone. It took me a long while to rid myself\nof the guilt and fear of turning my back on the Messiah, if in fact it was true,\ndespite the fact that I knew it could not be so. 1\nam now a member of a group called EMERGE to help people come to terms with coming out\nof a cult\u2014adjust to the real world again and to\nwarn others of the dangers they pose and the\nevil they represent. The Moonies and other\ncults are not only in the US but all over the\nworld. They entrap vulnerable, idealistic,\nintelligent young people and turn them into\nmental slaves, working eighteen hours per day\nin the belief that it is work for God enriching\nthe world, when in fact it is merely enriching\none man\u2014the leader of the cult in his personal\nquest for money and power.\nFELIX, June 18, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Hi there all you fun people, we\n(Phil and I) thought it wouldn't be\na bad idea if we tell you the rest of\nCollege what fun things we have\nall done and are going to do.\nLife oC Iy Remember all those terrific\nReport f parties at the beginning of each\nterm? They went just fine. The last\none was a bit tricky with just a few\nof us to clear up, with Phil our\nbeloved super-hack attacking a door in a moment of anger.\nOf course we don't get a single penny from any union (hint) or the\ndivision, so we have to break even if not better, which we have done.\nOne of the events we spent money on was the Life Sciences Revue,\njust before Easter. Well that was an amazingly original idea and I think I should get a prize for it and pulling the whole thing off, but then, I did win\na pen. We all had fun that night, hoping that Christine's daring costume\nwouldn't slip, but being disappointed anyway. All the same we raised a fair few quid for Rag and we're already planning another revue for\nChristmas. Do come out of the cupboard all you Pamela Rhys Riddihoughs!\nOf course you didn't come to College just for the social life, we all need\nsome six or eight hours of sleep a day, and I think I would be correct to\nsay that most of us prefer to do it during lecture and lab time. The academic reps are of course concerned that this time should be as\npeaceful as possible. Most of their work is done in committees no one\nattends, so academic news is s parce and secretive, but I do hear CB is to\nbe cut into two, and I also hear the faintest whisper that matters will\nimprove on the degree front.\nRemember the elections for dep reps? Yes you do \u2014 a load of idiots\nstood up during tea-break and disturbed everyone. I am ashamed to say\nfun people that you didn't all vote, and even more ashamed to say that\nmost of you seemingly voted Peter Burt\u2014if you know how this was done\nI'd like to know about it. But of course we love our new dep rep, just\nas we loved dear old Nathan (well his mother may have) and we should all\ngive Pete's mother our support.\nThe new Divisional Students Committee met for the first time the\nother day, we argued quite a bit, which is better than previous meetings\nwhen there was no one to argue with, but we did sort out a few things.\nWe discussed what to do with our money or more to the point where\nto put it. A man called Marco, with a suspicious complexion, said he had\na good property deal going in Southside, but we thought better of it. Mike\nis now in charge of the money and he says he'll keep it in a hole in the side\nof the river. Phi! however says that if ever we are passing his place we can\ndrop in for a battle of vodka and a sweatshirt anytime.\nWe also discussed the next Life Sci Party. This is of course at the\nbeginning of next term, the first Tuesday in fact. A chap pie from the\nUnion called Greenpiece or something said it wouldn't be, and also that\nwe couldn't have our own tickets, but Peter sorted the bugger out (he\nwaved his finger at him, behind his back).\nThe Division likes to give the fresher s a spot of tea before the party, so\nthey give us some loot to buy food and hire the J CR. Somehow we have\nto come up with a lot of but ties, Neil says he'll organise this bit, and any\nthat help him will get some tea. I have taken over the bar from Dan and I 'll\noffer coffee to any that help me. If you're big an' ugly, and I don't believe\nDanka is, Pete will offer you biscuits, tea and coffee, if you help on the\ndoor. We do need your help because we still need oodles more money to\ndo the things we'd like to do for you.\nWe'll be getting some T and sweatshirts next term so order your size\nnow.\nLast point; the first and second year exams both finish on Thursday 24.\nThe Royal College of Music bar opens at 4:00pm. Need I say more?\nYou'll come back now\nlove\nGeoff\nPS: The whole College may be glad to hear, and particularly Debbie, that\nMatt Smith has been locked up by College authorities at Silwood.\nDespite a breakout during Rag Fete it is otherwise safe to say that all\norganised student bodies have a better chance of remaining so.\n\u2022Polish boy scout requires Polish girl\nguide, experience an advantage.

The CC Us should still be able to do all\nthe stunts they have in the past\u2014this time without getting\narrested! However, this will mean\nthat our designated charities are\nbound to get less money, but I hope to cushion this by making\nmore in Rag Week. The best way\nis by some sort of mega stunt, for\nwhich we can be sponsored\u2014\npreferably by companies as well as\npeople, and attract media public i ty.\nWe also need an emblem for\nnext year: this year it was a kangaroo for Ragaroo 82, but I don't want next year to be\nWallaby 83.

At the Inter-Varsity Ball in Southampton, IC were a disappointing eleventh, but this did not do justice to the quality of the\nteam's dancing. The culmination of the team's success was at the Varsity\nMatch Ball hosted by Oxford. Simon Carter and Melanie Cooper were\nrunners-up in the Open Ballroom competition and the Latin American\ncompetition was won by Richard Williams and Sally Barton. Congratulations to them and many thanks also for the keen involvement\nof Vicky Welsh and Alan Logan (quickstep) and Rebecca May and Alan\nEdwards (jive).\nMembers are reminded that lessons continue until Monday, June 21,\nand those who are interested in summer lessons should contact\ncommittee members before the end of term. Those who would like to\ncompete for the team next year should approach committee members\nsoon so that the team may be organised.\nOn behalf of the incoming committee I would like to thank the outgoing\ncommittee for their excellent work and sustained commitment to the\nclub throughout the year.\nR.

May I stress once again how important it is for us to\nhave this information to ensure that the books you want for your\nstudents to have are in stock at the start of term. Once we get\nthat information, we can send out the orders. Consider though\nthat it takes on average twenty working days from UK publishers\nand ninety working days from outside the UK for our orders to be\nprocessed, you can see how little time we have.

    "content": "Lindley weighs anchor\nCaptain John William Garbutt\nLindley RN is to voluntarily\nretire at Christmas.\nThe Captain boarded HMS Sherlield on Monday, November\n24, 1975 to take on the newly\ncreated post of Domestic Secretary, who is in overall charge of\nBookings, Refectories, Halls of\nResidence and Security. He previously had along and distinguished career with the\nRoyal Navy \u2014 he rose to the rank\nof Captain and was a Naval Aide-de-camp to the Queen. He was Commander of HMS Cochrane, usually known as the\nFleet Accommodation Centre of Rosyth Naval Base.\nHis activities at IC went virtually unnoticed by FELIX until the\nsummer of 1980 when he suddenly came into the limelight. Throughout that year he made numerous appearances and it became\nclear that the Captain was not the model of efficiency and diplomacy\nwe had expected.\nThe Captain was we lb known for his numeracy, but when asked how\nmany times he had appeared in FELIX he said \" I don't know, I don't stand and count 'em, and it's not up to me to count them either....but\nthere were quite a lot.\"\nCaptain Lindley is not 65.\nASTMS Dispute\nLaboratory Technicians have been picketing entrances to IC since last\nThursday in support of a national pay and conditions claim.\nLast week some gates were manned from 9:00am to 5:00pm in an\nattempt to stop supplies reaching College. This week pickets have been\non duty from 7:00am to 6:00pm at more entrances.\nThe IC dispute is part oPa national campaign. The technicians want\na12% wage increase, a reduction of 2'/._, hours in the week to 35 hours,\nand three days more annual leave.\nThey have been offered 4% for those over 21 and 0% for trainees.\nThe national negotiating body recommended selective strike action\nol not less than 3 hours per week and this has been given a \"guerilla'\ninterpretation here by the Association of Scientific Technical and\nMangerial Stall' ( ASTM S) who represent the IC lab technicians. This\naction will continue until the dispute is settled.\nMr Ian French, I CAST MS Branch Chairman, said that the picket\nhad been \"incredibly successful\" with 75% of goods turned back. After\na deputation went to the post office workers they agreed not to cross\npicket lines or make deliveries of mail outside their normal hours\nASTM S members who are not lab technicians can choose whether\nor not to take part in the action.\nMr French added that the aim of the action was to influence College\nadministrators to support their claim at national level. However the\nCollege have said that they do not believe it is in their interest to make\ntheir views known publicly as it might compromise their side of the\nnegotiating committee.\nII the dispute dragged on, he said, then unfortunately it would be\nhard not to effect students, .along with the refectories and general\ndeliveries. ASTM S realised that their strongest weapon against College\nwas to disrupt e examinations, but have refrained from doing so.\nEffects of the dispute have already been felt. Deliviries of beer to the\nHolland Club were stopped on the li rst morning. Liquid nitrogen\nsupplies were drying up. This might adversely alf ect chemical plant\nwhich would be inclined to blow up if not kept cool. Last Thursday\ntechnicians picketed a meeting of French University Principals at 170\nQueensgate.\nMr French told FELIX that the dispute might last until at least July\n1. That date was chosen by the employers to discuss conciliation with\nAC AS. Mr Davidson, Personnel Secretary, was unavailable for comment\nPiggy brings the house down!\nDr Brian Levitt, the new Mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, has soon\nlanded in hot water following the demolition of the old Kensington\nTown Hall last Friday.\nThe Greater London Council are furious that his Tory council\ndecided to demolish the 105 year-old building and intend to take legal\naction if possible. Kensington and Chelsea Council say that the\nredevelopment of the site will bring in revenue of four to five million\npounds, but according to The Times Diary (Monday, June 16) the\nCouncil seem to have forgotten that they had already given planning\npermission for a conversion of the old building. The present\ndevelopment will result in a loss of 11,000 square feet of floor\nspace\u2014worth about three million pounds at present prices.\nSo the old scheme would have been more profitable without\nknocking the building down!\nJasper collapses\nin heroic record\nsmash bid!\nIC Radio disc jockey Jeremy' Jasper' Nunn s collapsed on Sunday, June6, while attempting\nto set a new record for a single\ncontinuous professional radio show.\nJasper started his programme\nat 4:00pm on Friday, June4, at\nthe IC Radio Studio below Southside and lasted almost forty three hours; the record still stands at forty-eight and a half hours. Fortunately for Jasper\nformer Station Manager Dave\nFuller was present to rush him to\nSt. Stephens Hospital but he was\nreleased later that evening.\nThe collapse is thought to have\nbeen caused by Jasper drinking\ntoo much coffee and not eating\nenough solid food.\nThe, present Station Manager Neil Sykes would like to thank all\nthose students from the Halls of\nResidence who helped during the\nrecord attempt.\nMETROPOLITAN POLICE\nAppeal fo rA\ns sistance MURDER On Tuesday, June 1, about 1pm, Lady EDITH ROBERTSON was attacked at\nERE S SY HOUSE, RUTLAND GATE. She died later.\nLady Robertson was 80,5ft3 in s and plump with\ngrey hair. She was wearing a blue two-piece suit,\nblue shoes, and carried a large blue handbag.\nShe walked very slowly with stooped shoulders.\nShortly after the attack a lady was seen\ncomforting the victim at the rear entrance to\nERE S BY HOUSE at MONTPELIER WALK.

    "content": "8.8. Wolffe*\n8ig Slack 800k Hi everybody, I'm back again with a few\njuicy items for you all. There's been a bit\nof a vacuum on the scandals and exposes\nfront this term, as I 've been busy looking\nfor Lord Lucan again in the tunnels under\nIC. But never fear, B.B. is back!\nI'm told that revolting J CR bartender Alan\nLarson is a native of North America. Last\nterm this glutinous mountain of a man was\ntaking part in one of his customary alcoholic\nbinges and was soon completely unable to stay\nupright. A few friends, who had been playing\n\"spot the amorphous mass\", offered him a hand and returned him to the S her field Building. The jolly barman claimed that he'd left all his money in his jacket, which was still in\nthe J CR Bar.\nWhen he'd eventually woken the security\nguard he was refused entrance because he was\nfar too drunk. In desperation he rolled over to\nthe Union Bar and borrowed \u00a35 from Bar\nManager Jimmy Carrol for a taxi.\nLater in, the week when equally rotund\nCatering Manager Victor Mooney heard about\nJimmy' s generosity, he commented\" You should have given him \u00a3127\u2014so he could buy\na single ticket back to New York!\" WImwi* t jtg tj jg Home Talking about our bumbling catering manager,\nVictor is known as a bit of a slave driver. In fact\n\u2022\n1 can reveal that he even keeps a camel driver's whip in his desk, the handle of which screws\nout to reveal a dagger.\nJovial Victor got married again at Christmas\nand he's now living happily somewhere in\nLondon. My spies tell me that if you're up at\nthe right time you can even see him lumbering\ninto College on his newly acquired bicycle.\nWhat a sight that must be!\nBut hang on! Doesn't Victor have a luxury\nflat in Princes Gardens, supplied free of charge\nby the College? The same flat which was\ndecorated at great expense a few years ago?\nIndeed he does. A few years back, witnesses\nin the R CSU Office even saw Victor clambering through the front window in the\nearly hours, when his previous spouse locked\nhim out after alcoholic outings of his own. So if Victor's new home is within easy\ncycling distance, does he really still need a College flat?\nWhen I next hear the traffic report on the\nradio say there's an obstruction in Exhibition\nRoad, I 'll rush over and bend his ear!\nI must admit the announcement of Captain\nLindley' s retirement brought a tear( of\nlaughter) to my eye, and there has to be one\nmore story for old times sake.\nPetty Officer Lindley seems to have-been\nhaving a bit of trouble with the sign on his\noffice door. About a year ago his original,\nbearing name rank and room number, disappeared. To replace it a typed piece of\ncard was erected( using standard colour drawing pins of course), but this too went\nabsent without leave. Of course I know nothing about the whereabouts of these\nwandering items, but it did make me laugh to\nhear that a sign saying \"Private\" has now\nappeared on his door.\nI bet the old salt didn't expect to be demoted\nand transferred before being put out to grass!\nGmitotM Pig\nIC Choir hanger on and retiring Dean of\nGuilds \"Professor\" Eric Brown seems to have\na healthy eye for business.\nAccording to sources in the Civil Engineering department, the good professor \"recommends\" students on his course to buy a wonderful little textbook written \"by\u2014guess\n\u2022 who?\u2014Eric Brown. Not that this is so unusual,\nbut my moles also reveal that the book is long\nout of print and that he has the only stock from\nwhich his wretched students can get their copy\nin his office.\nTo really clean up our snobbish little\nsalesman also press u rises people into not\ntaking notes during his lectures, which means\nthey have to buy his book. If they do take\nnotes he apparently stops lecturing to take the\npiss!\nWell done Eric, that's setting a fine example\nfor British businessmen! If only they were all\nlike you the country would be back on its feet\nin no time.\nIncoming Rector's doormat Steve Goulder has\nhad one or two strange adventures. None\nmore so than his transvestite wanderings\nfollowing the Rag and Drag Disco in 1980.\nOur hirsute sabbatical-to-be had been doing\nhis best to impersonate the then Deputy President Rae Snee by shoving two enormous\nballoons up the front of a slinky red dress. He foolishly left his clothes in the R CSU Office\nand had to sleep in the FELIX Office without\nrecovering them, after he lost his partner Miss\nCaroline Godin.\nIn the morning Caroline unwisely took all his\nclothes to the Falmouth Hall room of FELIX Editor Steve Marshall. When Mr Goulder\nphoned to ask him to bring them over, Mr Marshall wickedly said \"It's starting to rain and\nI don't fancy going out\u2014why don't you come\nover here for tea?\" and promptly put the\nphone down.\nRather than argue our President elect strode over to Falmouth and was quite a sight\ncoming across Princes Gardens resplendent\nwith beard, red umbrella and a beautifully\nmatching dress!\nWhilst the Editor is selective about photographs for FELIX, I have found the following in\nthe Photosoc bins. If anyone would like to\nclaim them.\nFELIX, June 18, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "However the draft proposals proved\nunacceptable to IC's Board of Studies so\nthe merger was called off.\nJust before Christmas the Imperial\nCollege University Challenge team travelled\nto Manchester where they beat New Hall,\nCambridge. They followed this with a comfortable victory over Aberdeen and just\ndefeated Reading before falling to St.\nAndrews in the quarterfinals. The team's success was one of the most unexpected\nand pleasing aspects of the past year.\nTelevision\nIn addition to appearing on Blue Peter\nand University Challenge, the Union also\nmade an Open Door programme for\nBBC2. The programme highlighted the\ndifficulties encountered by overseas\nstudents when forced to pay full economic\nfees.\nSeveral well-known television personalities appeared at college this year,\nincluding Prof. Heinz Wolffe and Jim Francis (who created the special effects\nfor The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy), both of whom spoke to the\nnewly reformed HG Wells Society. STOIC interviewed a number of film celebrities,\nincluding Timothy Hutton, star of Taps\nand Ordinary People, and Jean-Jacques\nAnnaud, director of Quest For Fire.\nSeveral leading politicians spoke at\nCollege this year. Most were from the\nConservative Party including William\nWhitelaw, Norman Tebbit and Sir Keith\nJoseph. Dr David Owen (SDP) and Neil\nKinnock (Labour) also spoke.\nAll of these speakers stressed that\nuniversities cannot depend entirely on the\ngovernment for their finance and suggested\ncloser collaboration with industry.\nCollege had already realised this in\nMarch when they set up Imperial Biotechnology Ltd. The company was set up\nto exploit the commercial potential of the\nbiotechnology pilot plant in the Biochemistry department.\nShut that door!\nResidence\nAlthough the penthouse flats in Southsidewere finally let out to students in January a number of other College owned flats, notably the refectory flat in the Union Building which had been vacant for years,\nremained unoccupied. Hall rents were also\nincreased by \u00a31.50 in January, an increase\nagreed with \"in principle\" in November by\nNick Morton, despite the Union's policy\nagainst mid-session rent increases.\nIn March a system of electronic bolts\nwere installed in the Southside Basement\nbut were vandalised within an hour. This\ncaused an understandable outburst by Nick\nMorton at the U GM the following day.\nThere were also proposals to house two\nstudents in single rooms in Weeks Hall but\nthese have been she v led for this year.\nDecisions\nAlthough six of the nine Union General\nMeetings were quo rate this year, very little\nHG Wells Society's Pallab Ghosh demonstrating the immortal Wide-Mouthed Frog joke\nat the Society's annual dinner.\nThe HG Wells Society was reformed at\nthe start of this session and became one of\nthe largest societies at college, attracting\nmore than 500 members.\npolicy was passed. Motions were only\" passed in the first term and these included\nmotions on government cuts, Iranian students and Princess Anne, as well as the\nRag Mag motions. A motion proposing a referendum on re-affiliation to the National\nUnion of Students was defeated.\nThe Results U GM in March was the most\nconfusing, and at times farcical, meeting of\nthe year. The vociferous meeting refused to\nratify Steve Goulder's election as President\nand voted to rerun all four sabbatical elections. However after the meeting Returning Officer Marco Ledwold decided\nthat the grounds of the objections were\ninvalid under the constitution and he\nrefused to rerun the election. An Emergency General Meeting two weeks\nlater ratified all the elections.\nThe other successful candidates were\nPhil Greenstreet (Deputy President), Mary\nFreeman ( Hon Sec) and Martin S. Taylor\n( FELIX Editor).\nThere were two general meetings, including the annual one, scheduled for the\nsummer term but quorum was successfully\nchallenged at the start of each meeting.\nThe most important development concerning the Union this year was undoubtedly the announcement of a possible move to the Southside basement.\nThis issue is covered at length overleaf.\nFELIX As ever, FELIX provided a focal point for\nthe discussion of relevant issues. Old campaigners like Dr Frank James have\nfound new enemies to fight it out with on the\nletters page. The Soapbox articles have also\nbeen fairly lively and have provided a means\nfor expressing an opinion on topics as\nvaried as South Africa and the state of RCS Union. FELIX has maintained a critical role,\nfocussing attention on both the College and\nthe Union. There have been few things\nwhich have slipped by without comment\nand yet the College still seems to carry on\nmaking slip ups which are potentially embarrassing.\nThe reluctance of Union President Nick Morton to be totally open with information\n' has led to some friction between himself and\nFELIX Editor Mark Smith. However, Mr Morton has often responded well to\ncriticism with some fine letters on one or\ntwo occasions.\nMark Smith's decision to allow free\ncomment during the sabbatical election\ncampaign was undoubtedly a major change\nof direction for FELIX, and it is ironic that it\nwas a simple error in interpretation of the\nvoting procedure which lead to such confusion at the time. None of the election\nSoapbox articles resulted in a challenge to\nthe conduct of the elections.\n1981-82 started with a series of\nmistakes which are catalogued at the\nstart of this review. As 1982-3 approaches the stakes are even higher.\nDecisions will not be made about the\nUnion Lower Lounge but the entire\nUnion building. The new and future\nexecutives must ensure these mistakes are not repeated.\n\n"
