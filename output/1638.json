    "content": "Nikita Bathija\nHaving come to the end of my degree I understand the importance of enjoying university life. In what will be some\nof our most memorable years, the Union plays a crucial role and I would like the opportunity to give-back to the\ncollege as DPFS. If elected, I would promote the development of the College and Union Alumni networks in order\nto build community and encourage new avenues for club sponsorship. Reform space booking to ensure efficient\nuse of Union resources. Continue the work of the current DPFS and implement Gift Aid on donations. Actively seek\nfeedback and student input to plan the events that you want.\nMy ideas are shaped around bringing you the best experiences whilst a student and also once you\u2019ve graduated.\nBeing on the committee for ChemSoc last year, I understand the work that goes into building a successful society.\nIn addition, during a recent internship in the City I demonstrated that I am comfortable dealing with finances.These\nexperiences, coupled with my strong desire to improve College life, means I will work with student volunteers\nto deal with tasks and problems efficiently. Optimising the Union\u2019s ability to enhance the student experience, by\nensuring it is financially sound, is central to my candidacy. I will work hard with the other elected officers to shape a Union that you have a say in and can be\nproud of as a student and graduate.\nPhilip Kurukgy\nHello! I am Phil in 2nd year Chem Eng. My manifesto has 7 goals, that outline plans for a stronger union that actually\nmakes an impact on your student experience. FUNDING: Enhancing sponsorship funds for activities and societies,\nespecially small ones to provide funds to grow. Maintaining budgets for societies in real terms (adjusted for inflation).\nAIR CONDITIONING: Lobby college to deliver the student petition for air conditioning in the central library. FEES:\nLobby college to freeze fees increases for international students, campaign against any future government increases\nfor home students and against hall rent prices increase.\nREVENUE: Find NEW revenue streams for societies and the union by organising more events and activities, new\nsponsorships from external organisations (renown Imperial employers...) and lobbying for college subsidy. FOOD\n& DRINKS: Review the union food and drink outlets, parties, reduce costs and enhance quality. EFFICIENCY: My\nexperience as a hall senior, organising a year of fresher\u2019s activities on a tight budget, has taught me to maximise\nefficiency. RIGHTS: Be a strong defender of your rights, raising your views at College and Union council as\nI\u2019ve already done as member of council and on FELIX. I am a passionate student activist, the time has come to ensure our views and opinions are properly\nrepresented. A vote for me is a vote to amplify the Union\u2019s IMPACT on your student experience!\nVoting opens 12:00 midday, Monday 13 June and closes 12:00 midday, Friday 17 June. Vote online at: imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\nRachel Blythe\nHaving worked with the Students\u2019 Union for the past four years, as Duty Manager of 568,The Union Bar & Metric\nfor the past year, I have loved devoting my time at University to improving service, taking care of more than 50\nclub/society/project events and making each night as enjoyable as possible, whilst jointly accounting \u00a31.76 million\nin food and drink sales. VOTE-Experience! Regularly interacting with students has allowed me to fix recurring\nissues: Suggesting new wide-screenTVs in 568 and Metric. Expanding diet-specific options, e.g. introducing new\nvegetarian items. Reducing queuing time by 10 minutes on ACC and CSP nights. Updating security to ensure\ncustomer safety remains a top priority. VOTE-Progress!\nMy future policies will continue this progress: Increasing affordable, healthy options across ALL campuses, by\nreducing price and average calories by 10%. Using customer surveys to highlight inefficiencies and improve\ncleanliness, quality and speed of service. Better rewards and loyalty schemes in Shop Extra, Reynolds Bar, h-bar and\nThe Foundry. Improving postgraduate events and subsidies, by promoting alongside the Graduate Students Union.\nDocumenting how money spent across the venues is recycled back to students. VOTE-Funding! Having already helped to make tuition and maintenance fee\npayments more efficient, I will further: Lobby to increase the DPFS role in gaining sponsorship and approvals to speed up the annual budgeting process. Provide\nequal support to all CSPs. Reduce the ICSMU-ICU funding gap. Ensure first year students decide on their halls budgeting. If you also support these ideas, please\nvote Rachel for DPFS!!\nGautam Kambhampati\nI would like to see the Union make life easier for Clubs & Societies, and allow them to do what they do best: provide\nexcellent services to Imperial students. I would also like to see the Union financially justify bar profits and venue hire\nby being open and transparent about their profits and how these funds are used to support student activities.\nI will introduce variable spending caps for ClubTreasurers, set by Management Groups, to reduce red-tape. A better\nroom bookings system, instead of the current two-tier system, to reduce double bookings and the large delays in\nbooking requests being fulfilled. A return to easily accessed free printing for Clubs & Societies and Union-related\nactivities. Publication of details of bar profits in a readable format so students can decide for themselves whether\ndrinks mark-ups are value-for-money.\nAn open door policy for Club Chairs andTreasurers with financial issues. I have beenTreasurer of DramSoc,\nmanaging large budgets for events across the Union. Working with many other Clubs & Societies on budgets,\nmanagement, and running events from small karaoke events to the large annual productions by Overseas Societies. Collaborating with Union staff on the\nmanagement of large Union-run events such as the annual Summer Ball. Vote for Less Bureaucracy. Vote for MoreTransparency. Vote for a Better Union for All.\nVote Gautam for DPFS.\nYour Officer\nElections\nWhen elected my goals for next year are: I will work closely with union staff to further develop\nImperial Plus so the hard work you do gets recognised and accredited. Increase funding for Clubs and Societies.\nFunds available to clubs has not grown nearly as much as the membership funds has grown (there is a 30%\ndisparity between the two since 2011). I will carry on lobbying the college to ensure transparency in how your fees\nare being spent. Ensure the processes and systems in place to support club finances are quick and easy to use.To\nimprove the services at the union and get tangible proof of it; for example Cask Marque for the quality of drinks in\nthe barsThe DPFS role deserves a candidate of real experience and responsibility.\nI was given an Outstanding Service Award for my work as RSMU President particularly for my work in the social\nside, relating to union services. In this role I brought numerous papers and reports to Union Council and represented\nRSM clubs. Before that I was RSMU Hockey President and their 1st XI Men\u2019s Captain, I was also De La Beche\nClubTreasurer. From this I have learned a huge deal about the way clubs work. Student groups tend to be very\nself-motivated and the best way to support them is nurture them to allow their plans to be realised.Thank you for reading, Vote Warnick! #BelieveInBeard\n#BeMoreWarnick\nVoting opens 12:00 midday, Monday 13 June\nRemember to cast your vote! Voting opens 12:00 midday, Monday 13 June and closes 12:00 midday, Friday 17 June.\nBenjamin Bell\nI believe I have the commitment, experience and passion to make real lasting changes at Imperial. I\u2019ve been at\nImperial for both my undergrad and postgrad degrees and held positions including IC Hockey Club Captain and RSM\nVPCS. Below are some of the achievable changes I would like to implement. Sort out the library it is frankly ridiculous\nthat, despite having planning permission to do so, college refuses to install more air conditioning units in the library;\nexpecting students to work in these conditions is utterly unacceptable.\nWork with DPCS and the College to transfer more responsibilities from Sport Imperial I believe that sports clubs\nshould be overseen by elected, passionate and accountable students. Increase funding support to clubs and\nsocieties. Funding levels are not keeping up with increases in participation, more support is needed to secure\nsponsorship and funding particularly for smaller and ICSM clubs. Improve postgrad participation in union events\nstarting at a new uni can be intimidating, even for postgraduates. I would make a significant effort to engage with\npostgrads, particularly those who are new to Imperial.\nImprove the quality and variety of food on all college campuses.There are not enough quality, healthy food choices available for students, particularly vegetarian\nand vegan options. Abolish entry fees for standard nights at the Union It\u2019s our Union, we shouldn\u2019t have to pay! Improved support for students looking for\nhousing finding student housing can be very challenging, particularly for international students and those moving out of halls. http://tiny.cc/VoteBenBell\nBenjamin Warnick\nHere are the manifestos for Deputy President\n(Finance & Services) candidates.\nAll copy is provided by candidates and not altered by the Union.\n\n"

Our feature on the\nchanges to sabb pay isn\u2019t brand new\ninformation,but this is the first time\nany student, outside of the closed\ndoors of Trustee Board (literally\nthis time \u2013 they chucked out all the\nsabbs when the decision got made)\nwill have seen a breakdown of the\ndifference in payment between this\nyear\u2019s sabb team and next year\u2019s.\nAnd yes,I do think that\u2019s important.\nWe fork out a lot of cash for sabbs,\nand we want them to be good.\nWe want to pay them enough so\nthat they can eat, be housed, have\nnice enough lives, and for it to be\ninteresting enough financially that\nthe job appeals to everyone. It\u2019s the\nsame argument that gets brought\nup when we discuss MPs\u2019 pay. If we\npaid them pittance then the role\nwould only attract the richest, who\nwere able to take a hit. The same, I\nfeel, goes for sabbs. If we dock the\nbenefits to such a point, it could\nput the best, and not the wealthiest\npeople off.

I think\nif you\u2019re rich and haven\u2019t found a job\nyet, becoming a sabb is now a lot\neasier.

Photo Credit: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\nD\nespite a number\nof premature\nannouncements earlier\nthis week, E3 looks to\nbe as exciting as ever. For gamers\nthere\u2019s no time of the year that is\nmore anticipated and for gaming\njournalists (which I don\u2019t qualify\nas yet) there is none hated more.\nWhile a few early leaks and reveals\nexception \u2013 for the past few years\nthey have moved away from\nthe traditional press format and\nexclusivity of E3 (and it\u2019s physical\npresence in LA).\nBroadcasting \u2018Nintendo Directs\u2019,\nthey have been able to bypass the\ncost and effort of a physical press\nconference.And with the slow death\nof theWii U,Nintendo have decided\nto forgo even an online conference\nand will instead be focusing almost\nentirely on the latest Legend of\nZelda game in a number of streams\ncalled \u2018Nintendo Treehouse Live\u2019.\nA few other previously announced\ngames including Pokemon Sun and\nMoon, Pokemon Go, and Monster\nHunter Generations will also be\nlivestreamed from the conference\nfloor. Apart from that, don\u2019t expect\nmany surprises.\nIn more exciting news, Sony\nare set to reveal details of a more\npowerful, upgraded Playstation\n4. New games will be able to take\nadvantage of the reportedly large\ngraphical processing power increase\nbut will have to continue to support\nthe original model. This is seen by\nmany in the industry as a reaction\nto the smartphone sector\u2019s model of\nyearly iterative hardware upgrades.\nNot only will the console be\ncapable of outputting 4K it will\nalso be, as a result of improved\nhardware, a more compelling reason\nto purchase Playstation VR this\nautumn. Last year, Sony surprised\nfans with the announcement of\nFinal Fantasy VII and Shenmue 3,\nand many will hope to be as blown\naway this time round. It\u2019s likely\nwe\u2019ll see gameplay from Destiny:\nRise of Iron, a release date and more\ngameplay for The Last Guardian,and\na possible appearance from Rockstar\n(a new game in the Red Dead\nfranchise is heavily rumoured).\nThe announcement of a new Xbox\nis less likely but a number of insiders\nhave hinted that the new Xbox One\nwill be targeting a performance\nof six teraflops (whatever that\nmeans). Microsoft will show more\nof the already leaked Titanfall 2,\nmore from Halo Wars 2 which was\nteased at least year\u2019s conference,\nand lots of Gears of War 4 gameplay.\nSo basically lots of guys (and now\ngirls) with guns. Rare will show off\nmore of their open-world pirate\ngame Sea of Thieves, finally free from\ndeveloping the awfully dull Kinect\nSports games. It\u2019s amazing how\nquickly the internet, and gaming\npress, have forgotten that the\nKinect was originally bundled with\nthe Xbox One, much to the anger\nof gamers in 2013. Luckily, those\nterrible days are past us now and\nwe\u2019re now blessed instead with an\nendless stream of largely uninspired\nsequels. Don\u2019t expect Microsoft to\nshow any major new IPs this year.\nWhile previous console\ngenerations seemed to rely more\non exclusives, the success of the\nindustry in the last few years has\ncome about largely as the result of an\nincrease in cross-platform releases.\nThird-parties just aren\u2019t willing to\ntake the risk, even when there are\nlarge financial incentives from the\nconsole makers. Ubisoft might\nfinally deliver on the promise of\nthe original Watch Dogs trailer with\nWatch Dogs 2 which will be set in San\nFrancisco. And EA will show off\ntheir World War One first-person\nshooter Battlefield 1. Will Battlefield\n1 be respectful of the horrific events\nof the the Great War? Probably not,\nbut at least it\u2019s set in an alternative\nuniverse. Bethesda will reveal more\nof Dishonoured 2 and the two new\nplayable characters (this time you\ncan choose your gender) and it\u2019s\nrumoured that they will announce a\ndefinitive edition of Skyrim, making\nit playable for the first time on the\nPS4 and Xbox One. Outside of the\nlarger publishers, a leak on Tuesday\nrevealed that Injustice 2, the DC\narcade fighting game, will be\nWarner Brother\u2019s biggest showing.\nOther rumours have suggested that\nDon\u2019t\nexpect\nMicrosoft to\nshow any\nmajor new\nIPs this\nyear Ubisoft\nmight finally\ndeliver\non the\npromise of\nthe original\nWatch\nDogs trailer\na number of titles based on Marvel\nproperties (including Spider-Man)\nwill also be shown off. Despite\nthe success of the film franchise,\nso far there has been little effort\nto produce games based on the\ncinematic universe\u2019s vast array of\ncharacters.\nhave surprised some, this offload\nahead of the expo\u2019s official start next\nweek could be a sign that the major\npublishers have lots to show this\nyear.\nNintendo seem to be the one\n\n"

Yet, as Dr O\u2019Sullivan\npoints out in her speech in which\nshe described a woman who\neventually became paralysed due to\nher psychosomatic illness \u2013 \u201cIf your\nmind can get your body to start an\naction,why can\u2019t it stop actions too?\u201d\nIn these cases, books not only\nprovide an avenue for exploring\nthe complex human and scientific\nReading\ngives us the\ncollective\nexperience\nof what it\nmeans to be\nhuman\nfactors that affect psychosomatic\nillness, but also make it accessible to\nthe public and encourage discussion\nof difficult issues. Literature\nprovides an insight into situations\nwhere our deepest convictions are\nchallenged, and reading then gives\nus the collective experience of what\nit means to be human.\nFor more information visit:\nwellcomebookprize.org\n\n"

Even\nbefore sharing just the one computer\nin the corner of the living room\nwith your entire family, waiting\npainstakingly for the whirling ring\nof the AOL dialup to finish, only to\nbe kicked off again five minutes later\nwhen someone 'needed' the phone.\nWhen connecting with people\ninvolved \u2013 wait for it \u2013 walking over\nto their house and knocking over\nthe door.\nSince the revolution of the\ninternet, technology and computing\ndevices have rapidly evolved into\nsmaller, more powerful, and more\ncomplex tools \u2013 many of which are\nbeing generated and created here\non our campus. But I\u2019m not entirely\nsure we appreciate it. And to be fair,\nwho can blame generations that\nsimply have always known a life in\nwhich the entire world is accessible\nin their hands? There\u2019s just no\ncontext.\nSo here\u2019s some context \u2013 I\nrecently saw an old black and white\nphotograph taken in New York. It\nwas 1956, and there were four men\nin overalls laboriously pushing a five\nMB IBM server up a wooden ramp\ninto a truck, with a crowd of people\ncuriously watching. The server was\neasily half a cubic meter \u2013 for just\nthe five MB, which is nothing\ncompared to the capacity of say, a\nnew Apple iPhone 6 at 64 GB. It\u2019s\njust basically just a large photo on\nyour tablet.\nAfter furiously scribbling some\nnumbers on paper, I realised that\nan iPhone 6 would require 12,800\nof these machines to reach the\nsame capacity. At an average pace\nof a ten minute kilometer, it would\ntake me about six and a half hours\nto walk around the entire capacity\nof an iPhone in 1956. So in a mere\n60 years, we have compressed\ntechnology by at least six hours\n(that\u2019s not really a scientific fact,\ndon\u2019t quote me).\nConsidering the amazing leaps in\ntechnological advancement, maybe\nwe should place our appreciation of\nit contextually \u2013 be more cognizant\nof the awe-inspiring capacity we\ncarry around with us every day,\nand think carefully about what we\nactually use it for.\nNAOMI STEWART\nA\nt the end of last month\nwe witnessed the death\nof a lowland gorilla\nin Cincinnati Zoo.\nHarambe, who was put down\nduring an attempt to rescue a four-year-old boy who had fallen into\nthe enclosure. A week later and\nwe\u2019re still talking about the incident,\ndebating who\u2019s to blame. However,\ninstead of playing the blame game,\nperhaps we should be talking about\nthe role of zoos in the 21st\ncentury.\nAnimal collections have existed\nfor thousands of years, yet the\nmodern zoo is a 19th\ncentury\ninvention, aiming to educate and\ninspire the public. However the\nbiodiversity onslaught we started\nnoticing in the 20th\ncentury, made\nIs there room for zoos in 2016?\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nthe need for conservation apparent\nand in 1933 the World Association\nof Zoos and Aquariums produced\nits first conservation strategy.\nToday, conservation is not only\na key element of the aims and\nobjectives of most zoos, but also a\nkey justification for keeping animals\nin captivity.\nSo what are the implications\nfor zoos as institutions, when an\ninvaluable member of a critically\nendangered species is put down?\n\u201cIt's really galvanised public support\nfor questioning the purpose of\nthese institutions,\u201d say Elisa Allen,\nAssociate Director at the People for\nthe Ethical Treatment of Animals\n(PETA), UK. \u201cWhat is this\nintelligent self aware animal doing\nin captivity for our entertainment?\u201d\nMany questions arise when\nconsidering the inner workings of\nzoos. How much of a zoo\u2019s budget\nis allocated to scientific research,\nfor example? The San Diego Zoo,\nthe largest in the world, only spent\n7.6% of its income on research and\nconservation in 2014. The London\nZoological Society (ZSL) on the\nother hand spends approximately\n20% of its income on research and\nconservation, as is illustrated by\nits 2014 annual report. Yet in both\ncases, most of these funds come\nfrom external grants. Of the \u00a334.4\nmillion that is generated by its\nanimal collections, \u00a331.1 million\nis pumped back into the ZSL's\ncollections, to simply maintain\nthem.\nThat wouldn\u2019t be a problem if\nthe collections contained mainly\nendangered species. But in reality\nthey don\u2019t. Less than a third of\nmammals within the London Zoo\nare endangered. The same goes for\namphibians, with some species not\neven having been assessed yet.\n\u201cUltimately we have to look at the\nroot of the species declining and that\nalways comes back to their habitats\nbeing destroyed. Zoos would be far\nbetter off spending their money and\nresources in protecting these wild\npopulations\u201d concludes Allen.\nHowever, things are not that\nA captive lowland gorilla. There are less than 100,000 left in the wild. Photo\nCredit: Anthony\nA painting of the camel house at the London Zoo, from 1835. Photo Credit:\nWikipedia\nThere\nare really\nintricate\nfactors\nbehind the\nscenes\nthat people\ndon\u2019t\nunderstand\nsimple, as is pointed out by\nRosi Stoycheva, a conservation\nbiologist who has worked on many\nconservation projects across the\ncountry over the past five years.\n\u201cFirst many endangered species\nare in areas that are very remote.\nThere are permits you need to get to\nremove these animals from the wild.\nYou must consider if the animal will\nsurvive in the zoo environment and\nhow many you can harvest from the\nwild to create a breeding population\u201d\nsays Stoycheva.\nIndeed, the intricacies of\nendangered species\u2019 conservation\nare illustrated through numerous\nexamples of failed conservation\nattempts such as the extinction\nof the Sumatran Rhino from the\nMalaysian Peninsula when the five\nremaining captive individuals all\ndied within 18 days from disease.\nOther times, obstacles can be\nbureaucratic, with many well known\nas well as rumoured reintroductions\nbeing delayed due to governments\ngetting cold feet.\n\u201cThese are the issues that no one\nreally thinks about. There are really\nintricate factors behind the scenes\nthat people don\u2019t understand and\nthis is where a lot of the criticism\nstems from.\u201d\nZoos might not be perfect, but\nthey are an important conservation\ntool nonetheless.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t rely\non just one measure to solve your\nproblems,\u201d concludes Stoycheva.\n\u201cWithout zoos there wouldn\u2019t be as\nmany species.\"\nWhat is this\nintelligent\nself aware\nanimal\ndoing in\ncaptivity?\nThis week\u2019s science picture\nNatasha Khaleeq\nWriter\nExtensive stand of severely bleached coral. Photo Credit: Petchrung Sukpong\nC\noral bleaching has\nseverely impacted the\nGreat Barrier Reef\nover the past month.\nThe corals, which are in constant\ncompetition with algae for light\nand nutrients, seem to be losing the\nbattle, with many bleached coral\nskeletons completely engulfed in\nalgae. Pictures and testimonials\nfrom Lizard Island have been\npainting a grim picture of ghastly,\nbrown, decomposing coral. WWF\nAustralia shared pictures taken last\nmonth of granite Island \u2018ground\nzero\u2019 where a mass bleaching event\nkilled an estimated 22% of the reef\u2019s\ncoral.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is\ncurrently undergoing its worst\nbleaching in recorded history.\nApproximately 93% of the reefs\nalong the 2,300 kilometre site have\nsuffered bleaching. Coral bleaching\noccurs when water temperatures\nincrease causing coral to expel their\nsymbiotic algae which in turn result\nin their white-grey colour shift.\nA\nt Sh!t Sc!ence, we want\nto show that every\nscience paper is a drop\nof water that, in its small\nway, helps fill up the aquarium\nof human knowledge, so that us\nlittle humans can float around\nhappily oxygenated by the water of\ncognition. This week, you may have\nguessed, we are talking about fish.\nHave you ever had one of those\nannoying friends with an aquarium\nwho will swear that their fish\nrecognises them? \u2018Look how he\npresses up against the glass! He\nknows his mommy!\u2019 they\u2019ll say.\nWell I have,and it took everything\nin my power to contain the powerful\nurge to roll my eyes so far back\ninto my skull that they might not\nfind their way back to the front of\nmy head. But actually, science has\nrecently proven that they might\nhave a point.\nThis study, emerging from the\nUniversity of Oxford, was published\nYou will pay for you insolence human Photo Credit Joseph Bylund\nMARIANNE GUENOT\nSh!t Sc!ence\nLonely fishkeepers vidicated: fish can tell when you\u2019re being a dick\nin Scientific Reports this week.\nScientists presented a tropical fish\nwith pictures of human faces, and\nasked the fish to react to the pictures.\nThese fish, archerfish (Toxotes\nchatareus), are known to hunt aerial\nprey by projecting water at high\nspeed to knock them out, so it was\neasier for the scientists to train the\nfish to learn to hate one face, and\nspit in its direction whenever they\nwas presented to it.\nSurprisingly, the fish were capable\nof recognising one face out of 44\ndifferent pictures. This worked even\nif features such as hair and face\nshape were removed, showing that\nfish can, indeed, recognise the finer\ntraits of a face.\nNow, of course, the results of\nthis study go further than simply\nvindicating the legions of crazy fish\nowners. It\u2019s about how we recognise\nfaces as humans.\nFace recognition is paramount\nfor humans to establish proper\nsocial skills. This skill was\nlong thought to be reserved\nto humans, as the capacity to\ndiscriminate faces was found to\nbe hosted in the fusiform gyrus,\nlocated in the neocortex of the\nhuman brain. Facial recognition\nhad previously been identified\nin non-human mammals,\nsuch as dogs, sheep and cows,\nbut it could be argued that\nthose animals had evolved to\nrecognise faces as a consequence\nof domestication.\nThe premise of this article\nwas to investigate whether an\nanimal which had no reason to\nhave evolved to know human\nfaces, such as a fish from a\ntropical area, could learn to do\nso, even when those animals\nlack a neocortex. These results\nshow that facial recognition is\nnot a human trait, and do not\nrequire a brain the size of a\nhuman\u2019s.\n\n"

Nevertheless, there is an issue\nfundamental to our very wellbeing\nand self-esteem that never gets a\nmention. This article aims to rectify\nthat.\n\"How fundamental could\nsomething be?\", you\u2019re probably\nthinking. Stop for a moment.\nLook around you. Where are you\nright now? What are you doing? If\nyou are like most FELIX readers,\nI can hazard a guess. You are in a\nbuilding owned by the College. The\nwalls have an inoffensive colour,\nall corners meet precisely and\northogonally and the space is tidy.\nYou are on your way to something\nimportant, wending your way\nthrough the corridors and crowds\nto your destination. It\u2019s a short\nwhile to go, so you\u2019ve picked up this\nnewspaper and move on.You\u2019re very\nbusy, you don\u2019t have time to be on\ncampus, and even if you did, there\nare nicer places to be.Herein lies the\nissue: our campus is an unattractive\nplace to be.\nEverywhere you go on campus,\nbuildings and walkways have been\noptimised to increase traffic flow\nand reduce inefficiencies in cross-campus travel. Corridors have been\nwidened, time-consuming door\nhandles have been replaced with\nbidirectional push-doors, or better\nstill, automatic doors with sensors,\nallowing entry with no extra physical\nexertion and no unnecessary contact\nwith surfaces. The spread of disease\nhas been reduced, queues for food\nhave been tamed,and room booking\nhas become more efficient through\ncentralised, computerised systems.\nOur productivity should be shooting\nthrough the roof. We should\nbe breezing through our work,\nreaping the accumulated efficiency\ndividends from the tireless efforts of\nsuccessive campus architects.\nUndoubtedly, the achievements\nlisted above are significant. We\nmake daily use of these campus\nfacilities and services every time we\nattend lectures,work in labs,send an\nemail or study here.Yet we must ask\nourselves: what do we enjoy about\nbeing here? You\u2019d probably say it\u2019s\nthe people,or the buzz of innovation\nhere. You won\u2019t rate the architecture\nof our buildings highly. For many of\nus, the austerity of glass, steel and\nstone is too bleak and impersonal,\nwhile the minimally-decorated\ncorridors, low ceilings and dated\noffice ambiance stifle creativity\nand muffle character. Such an\nenvironment is appropriate for an\ninsurance company headquarters,\nbut not an innovative,world-leading\ninstitution of learning.\nOn every campus tour, the guide\nwill begin with a little bit of College\nhistory: the Great Exhibition of\n1851. Under the aegis of Prince\nAlbert, the best of the world\u2019s\nscience and technology were\nbrought to London, which in turn\ndemonstrated Britain\u2019s new ideas,\nexpertise and industrial skills. The\nexhibition was a resounding success.\nThe proceeds were used to establish\nfour pre-eminent bodies of public\neducation: the Victoria & Albert\nMuseum, the Natural History\nMuseum, the Science Museum\nand the Imperial Institute. After\nmore than a century of mergers\nand transformations, the fourth\nentity has become the College we\nknow today. Today very little of\nthe Imperial Institute remains, so\nwe can\u2019t define ourselves in terms\nof our architectural heritage. As\nthe custodians of Prince Albert\u2019s\nvision, how else can we show that\nwe continue to embrace the bold\nStunning. Photo Credit: Christian Richters\nFor many\nof us, the\nausterity\nof glass,\nsteel and\nstone is too\nbleak and\nimpersonal\nand the new?\nAs mentioned previously,our built\nenvironment appears to inculcate\nhomogeneity and sameness, rather\nthan vibrancy, self-realisation and\nenjoyment of life. Our College\nshould be a hive of all sorts of\ninteractions, from cross-disciplinary\nprojects to friendly chats in the\ncorridor. We should feel joy when\ncoming to the campus, whether for\nthe first time or for the thousandth\ntime. We should want to stay on\nafter classes finish, to spend time\namid green walls, water features\nand colourful walkways, not feel\nalienated by gargantuan, monolithic\nstructures of glass,concrete and steel.\nThe onus is on us to achieve change.\nSome problems are more easily fixed\nthan others; your campaign could\ninvolve: signing FELIX\u2019s petition\nfor library air-conditioning, talking\nto your departmental representative\nabout building enhancements,\ngardening on your building\u2019s\nbalcony,yarnbombing poles,making\na beach on Dalby Court or seeking\nstreet art commissions on footpaths\nand walkways on campus.\nWhatever the scale of your\ncontribution, your efforts won\u2019t go\nunnoticed.\n\n"

From frantic\npipetting to manic coding, it's all\nvery stressful \u2013 I've been there. But\nfor those of you, much like myself\na year ago, the end of uni does not\nequal a cry from relief. It means\nfacing your boggart which, let\u2019s be\nhonest, is far more soul wrenching\nthan Harry's dementor \u2013 the\ndreaded prospect of unemployment.\nWhen you finally managed to\nsmash that Goldman interview (it\nonly took you 566 attempts not to\nfuck up, but who's counting, right?),\nyou've got a few months before you\nbecome a real person in September,\nwhen that dollar blinding grad\nscheme starts, and there's only one\nthing to do \u2013 that generic gap yah\nthing and book an open ticket to a\ngeneric gap yah destination, much\nlike me. I'm currently cotching in\nSouth East Asia, and as a (self-proclaimed) seasoned traveller, I'm\ngoing to enlighten you with the six\ntypes of backpackers you'll meet, to\nmentally prepare you for your own\nshenanigans.\n1) The Enthused Yank\nMuch like a puppy on crack, this\nbreed of backpacker has far too\nmuch love for life and energy than\nshould be legally allowed. Along\nwith speaking at unsafely high\ndecibel levels, rivalling that filthy\nbass at Ministry, the enthused yank\nis also brimming with bullshit.\nHe'll recount his travelling tales\nwith such dramatics, you'll wonder\nhow this kid is still alive. Cyclones\nand lightning storms will feature,\nsunrises penetrating his spirit will\nbe routine, and inevitably, there\nwill be a mention of a divine\nintervention or two. Two days spent\nwith this freak may drive you over\nthe edge, so make sure you get out\nof that awkward hangout before he\nmentions that time when he casually\nparted the Red Sea.\n2) The Premature\nMid-Life Crisis Dude\nEvery hostel has one. It's that\ndude who's 30, quit his soul-destroying job, broken up with bae,\nand decided to fuck off overseas to\nfind himself, spiritually of course,\nwhilst partying with school leavers\nin a dingy nightclub seedier than\nCheapskates (RIP).\nWith a constant yearning for\naffirmation, and clingier than gum\non a tube seat, this dude will not\nleave you alone.This is even after you\nEU myths debunked\nWhat the Leave campaign says is going on versus what is actually going on\nStav Zalel\nWriter\nT\nhe claim: The EU open-borders policy puts\nstrain on the UK and\nmakes it harder for non-Europeans to settle in the UK.\nThe facts: According to a report\nby the Migration Observatory in\n2011, 95% of net migration to the\nUK was that of non-EU nationals.\nThe EU has no power over UK\nimmigration policies for non-Europeans. Under EU policy,\ncitizens of EU countries can settle in\nthe UK and work at any job without\na visa. UK citizens can do the\nsame in EU countries. According\nto the aforementioned report, the\nimmigration of EU nationals to\nthe UK is roughly offset by the\nemigration of UK nationals to other\nEU countries.\nBefore non-Europeans work in\nthe UK, they must be accepted to a\nposition in the shortage occupation\nlist that meets the minimum\nskills threshold. Then they may\napply for a work visa \u2013 a long,\nbureaucratic process for them and\ntheir potential employer. The UK\nrecently changed its immigration\npolicy in an explicit pledge to lower\nnet migration, making it more\ndifficult for non-Europeans to settle\nin the UK in an explicit pledge to\nlower net migration. The recent\nrestrictions and regulations include\nshortening the shortage occupation\nlist and increasing the minimum\nskills threshold, increasing the\nrequirements for institutions and\nbusinessestosponsornon-European\nstudents or employees, raising the\nminimum salary for a work visa, and\nincreasing restrictions on bringing\nfamily members to the UK. A UK\ncitizen who marries abroad cannot\nreturn with their non-European\nspouse unless they prove that they\nhave an annual income exceeding\n\u00a318,600 (or more if they have\nchildren). 47% of British citizens \u2013\nin particular, 61% of British women\n\u2013 do not meet this requirement.\nThe bottom line: Any suggestion\nthat the EU open-borders policy\ndisadvantages the UK is baseless,\nand any claim that the EU has a\nnegative impact on non-Europeans\nwishing to immigrate to the UK is\na lie.\nThe claim: The EU is an anti-democratic organisation.\nThe facts: There are three bodies\ninvolved in EU legislation. The\nCouncil of the EU (made up\nof government ministers of EU\ncountries) and the EU Parliament\n(elected by citizens of EU countries\nby proportional representation) are\nthe only bodies which pass EU\nlaws and policies. The European\nCommission just draws up proposals\nfor new EU legislation to be voted\non; it cannot pass laws. It comprises\n28 Commissioners \u2013 one for each\nEU country \u2013 who are suggested by\ntheir respective governments and\nmust be voted in by the European\nParliament. The Commission\u2019s\nown president must be supported\nby the majority of members of the\nEuropean Parliament to be elected.\nThe bottom line: Legislation and\nlaws are passed by EU countries\u2019\ngovernment ministers and elected\nEuropean Parliament members.\nThose involved in writing and\nenforcing legislation are elected by\nParliament members and EU heads\nof state. This procedure is different\nto the one at, say, Westminster,\nbut all contemporary so-called\ndemocratic governments are\nsomewhere on a spectrum between\ndemocracy and bureaucracy. \u201cThe\nEU is anti-democratic\u201d is an empty\nand hypocritical claim.\nThe claim: We won\u2019t lose out on\nErasmus, non-EU countries already\ntake part in the programme.We can\nbe like Switzerland!\nThe facts: Switzerland first\nparticipated in Erasmus in the\nacademic year 1992/3, but in the\nsame year voted against joining\nthe EEA, ending its participation\nin all EU education programmes.\nIn the early 2000s Switzerland\nand the EU signed agreements\nincluding freedom of movement,\nand in 2011 Switzerland regained\nfull participation in Erasmus; but its\neligibility was revoked again in 2014\nafter it voted to limit immigration\nthrough quotas, breaking its free\nmovement treaties. The Swiss\ngovernment then arranged the\ninterim solution of allocating\n$25million to fund Swiss students\nstudying in Europe and Europeans\nstudying in Switzerland,allowing an\nexchange programme to continue.\nToday it is an Erasmus Partner\nCountry, meaning it can participate\nunder certain conditions.\nThe bottom line: Free movement\nof people is an EU requirement\nfor participation in its education\nprogrammes. As the UK does\nnot intend to keep its open-borders policy if it leaves the EU,\nit will struggle to maintain its full\nparticipation status,and considering\nthe UK\u2019s domestic education\npolicies, it is unlikely to set up an\ninterim programme, Switzerlandstyle.\nThe claim: Leaving the EU won\u2019t\naffect European stability. It\u2019s not\nparted ways six weeks ago, thanks\nto social media; his Facebook posts\nrival both the abundance, and the\n(shit) quality of the status updates\nof your 14-year-old self. Mock all\nwe may at the tragic nature of this\ndude's escapades, but through that\nthick wall of judgement, nothing\nseems to be able to get rid of that\nniggling at the back of your head\npestering you,that this guy may be a\nhazy prediction of your own future.\n3) The I'm not a tourist,\ntourist\nObsessed with shedding her\nwestern ways of thinking, and\ninsistent she's not travelling for the\nInstagram glory, this backpacker's\nnot on holiday, she's on a cultural\nvoyage.

Today, across Europe, the\npolitical far-right is on the rise. For\ninstance, this April, the Freedom\nParty of Austria lost the second\nround of presidential elections by\nless than 1% of the votes, and in\nMarch the Alternative for Germany\nparty won over 13% of the votes in\nGerman local elections. What these\nand other far-right parties across\nEurope have in common is extreme\nnationalism and xenophobic anti-immigration policies.\nThe bottom line: Countries\nunited economically and politically\nare less likely to go to war against\neach other. It is easy in a time of\npeace to forget that war could ever\nagain happen in Europe, but this\nis ignoring history to the point of\ndenial. If the UK leaves the EU, the\nmoderate European governments\nwill continue their peaceful\nrelations \u2013 but with the alarming\nEurope-wide rise of nationalism\nand xenophobia, which European\ngovernments we will see in 10 years?\nIn 20 years?\nClingier\nthan gum\non a tube\nseat, this\ndude will\nnot leave\nyou alone\nperhaps?

Every place is\nconveniently a few minutes\u2019walk off\nPortobello Road, the main road that\nstretches all the way from Notting\nHill Gate tube station right up past\nthe A40 Westway. Trust me, there\u2019s\nmuch more to Notting Hill than the\nmovies and a few cracked pots at the\nantiques market.\nLisboa Patisserie\nLet\u2019s start from the north. This\nsection looks a bit run down but\ndon\u2019t judge by appearance \u2013 this is\nexactly where the most authentic\nPastel de Natas, or Portuguese\ncustard tarts, in London live. Lisboa\nPatisserie sits on the far end of\nGolborne Road, east of Portobello\nRoad. Expect a bright red awning\nand a sign in black, old-school font\nat the door.\nOn weekend mornings you\u2019d\nfind her buzzing with Portuguese\nlocals forming a short queue at the\nentrance. Old couples sit outside\non metal tables and chairs, sipping\ntheir coffee and munching on\nplatefuls of golden pastries. People\ncome and leave with boxes of treats\nfor takeaway. Upon entry you\u2019d\nbe greeted by a long, nose-height\nglass counter absolutely stacked\nfull of all sorts of traditional buns,\ncakes and pastries. And that warm,\nbuttery, heavenly smell of freshly\nbaked goods drifting from the ovens\nhidden behind.\nThis is when the pressure starts.\nYou have approximately one minute\nto make up your mind before the\nservers dressed in red polo shirts\ndemands for your order. Don\u2019t\nworry if you don\u2019t know the name\nof that gorgeous looking cream bun.\nIt\u2019s okay to point.\nPastel de Nata. How can I\ndescribe them? A palm-sized, crispy\nyet slight chewy pastry tart filled\nwith a wobbly, velvety-smooth,\nsweet egg custard with black\nsplotches on the top. Each bite is\nbliss. Other favourites are bolo de\narroz (rice cupcakes) and bolo de\ncoco (coconut cake). Did I mention\nhow unbelievably wallet-friendly\nthis bakery is, even with such good,\nauthentic food in 2016? A Pastel de\nNata is just \u00a31.15 and other pastries\nrange from 95p to \u00a31.30. There is a\nminimum card payment of \u00a35 but\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to not leave with\nan overflowing box.\nSnaps + Rye\nA few steps back towards\nPortobello Road is a modern\nScandinavian caf\u00e9 by the name\nSnaps + Rye. Its bright, simplistic\ninterior with white walls, wooden\nfloors and stylish chairs totally\nembraces the Danish concept of\nhygge (pronounced as hoo-ga) \u2013\nmeaning to live comfortably and\nhappily.\nBreakfast and brunch is served\nevery morning with items including\na hearty buttermilk oat porridge,\nfreshly baked Danish pastries\nand skyr, an Icelandic yoghurt.\nTheir all-day menu is comprised\nof light salads and healthy bites\nusing seasonal, locally sourced\ningredients, ranging from \u00a35 to \u00a39.\nSomething that must not be missed\nis their delicious and photogenic\nselection of Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d, which are\nessentially open sandwiches on a\npiece of buttered dark rye bread.My\nfavourite would go to their house-cured Gravalax Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d (\u00a32.50)\n\u2013 slices of Nordic style, sweet cured\nsalmon garnished with black pepper,\nradishes and dill.\nFabrique Bakery\nWalking down south past the\nWestway is the newcomer to the\nneighbourhood \u2013 Fabrique Bakery.\nOriginated from Stockholm, this\nartisanal bakery also has branches\nin Hoxton and Covent Garden,\nserving the best Swedish cinnamon\nbuns (\u00a32.50) in London.\nStep in to find a small cosy space\nwith white tiles and industrial style\nlighting. Trays of freshly baked\ncinnamon buns, vanilla buns and\ncardamom buns (all \u00a32.50) are\ncasually stacked in a tempting pile\nnext to the counter. The rustic\nlooking shelves and baskets are\nstocked with sourdough loaves\navailable in white and dark rye.\nTheir cinnamon buns with a\nglass of hot chocolate is the perfect\nformula for a Sunday afternoon\npick-me-up \u2013 or fika as they say\nin Sweden. These small pillows\nof joy are deliciously moist and\nchewy, with a slightly crispy exterior\ngenerously smothered with caramel.\nThe flavours from the sweet and\nwarm spices circulate your mouth\ngenerating a sense of peace and\nhappiness. No exaggeration.\nGranger & Co.\nHead further southeast to the\npristine Westborne Grove. Those\nwho know me or have read my\nreview a few months back would\nunderstand my absolute loyalty\nand love for this Aussie style all-day eatery \u2013 everything from the\nchairs to the animal print coffee to\nof course, the stack of warm, golden,\nfluffy ricotta hotcakes, complete\nwith a freshly peeled banana, a\nmelting knob of honeycomb butter\nand soaked in maple syrup (\u00a312).\nHeaven.\nIf the ricotta hotcakes are too\nheavy for you,do try their scrambled\neggs (\u00a38.20). They are truly one-of-a-kind \u2013 pale yellow and cream-like,\ngarnished with a single spinach\nleave and served with two slices of\nbuttered sourdough toast. For the\nhealth-conscious, you will never be\nshort of supply of green smoothies,\nacai bowls, porridge and chia seed\npots.\nTheir lunch and dinner menus are\nfull of unique creations: courgette\nfritters (\u00a311.50), kimchi fried rice\nwith soft shell crab (\u00a314.50), a\ndrop-dead gorgeous fried chicken\nsandwich (\u00a39.50).\nClockwise from top left: The most photogenic sandwich ever from Snaps + Rye, Cinnamon bun and hot chocolate, vanilla\nbuns both from Fabrique, golden goodies from Lisboa Patisserie.

The pay\nrise and change of remuneration\npackage was advertised in the 2016\nElection Guide, so all candidates\nran knowing about the new deal.\nA union representative told\nFELIX: \u201c The Board of Trustees\nregularly review all aspects of\nremuneration for Officer Trustees\nand staff. In January the Board took\nthe view that living in halls no longer\nrepresented part of the Officer\nTrustee role and as such opted to\nremove the previous penalty for\nliving out of halls. Officer Trustees\nand full-time Officers are now paid\na set point on the College\u2019s pay scale\nand can opt to pay to live in halls\nshould they wish.\u201d.\nProfessor Kibble was a well-loved member of staff.

J. Sakurai Prize for\nTheoretical Particle Physics.\nIn 2014,Tom Kibble was knighted\nafter the Higgs boson\u2019s existence was\nproved during huge experiments at\nCERN in 2012. Imperial physicist,\nProfessor Virdee, who was knighted\nwith him after overseeing the CMS\nexperiment at CERN, said at the\ntime: \u201cI was hoping Tom would be\nrecognised. I'm very, very happy for\nhim, and I'm sure we'll have a glass\nof champagne when next we meet\u201d.\nWhen Higgs and Englert were\nawarded the Nobel prize, they\nwere surprised that Kibble was not\nalso named in the honours, as the\nrules permit three scientists can be\nnamed. At the time, Higgs said:\n\u201cNot only did [Kibble] publish the\nlast of the papers in 1964, he also\nwrote a longer paper that was really\nvery important in generalising the\nsort of thing I had written in '64'\u201d.\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nWho are these people?

But Black manages\nto pull it off,supported by the strong\ncast, to make The Nice Guys a light,\nbuoyant piece of entertainment.\nTo say that The Nice Guys is in on\nthe joke of the genre tropes would\nbe a massive understatement. The\nfilm sets out its mission statement\nin its opening: a young boy sneaks\ninto his parents room to steal his\nfather\u2019s Playboy lookalike only to\nbe interrupted when a car crashes\noff one of the iconic ridges of the\nSan Fernando Valley, directly into\nhis home. Upon examination of the\ncrash, the kid finds adult film actor\nMisty Mountains (Murielle Telio)\nnaked, bloodstained, and writing on\nrock, offering up the beguiling last\nwords \"How do you like my car, big\nboy?\" It\u2019s an indicator of the time\n(late 1970s) and place (Downtown\nL.A.) so immediate the opening\ntitles are redundant.\nThis scene, with its sexual\nobjectification dripping in casual\nviolence, sets the tone for the\nduration of the two-hour-long film,\nwhich takes several cues from Paul\nThomas Anderson\u2019s superlative\n1997 work Boogie Nights, another\nfilm set around the porn industry of\n1970s LA.Those taking the scene at\nface value would be rightly offended,\nbut soon it becomes clear just how\nmuch of a parody The Nice Guys is,\nand how everyone \u2013 the director,the\ncast, the audience \u2013 are in on the\njoke. The crash scene is followed by\nanother collision, this time between\nthe two principles: Holland March\n(Ryan Gosling), the down-and-out\nalcoholic PI who litters his rented\napartment with scotch bottles\nfollowing his wife\u2019s death; and\nJackson Healy (Russell Crowe), an\nRyan Gosling and Russel Crowe play the odd couple in 1970s neo-noir comedy The Nice Guys. Photo Credit: Warner Bros.\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nGosling\nshows us\nhe retains\nhis strong\ncomedy\nchops\nNeo-noir shadows and Californian sun\nThe Nice Guys is a send-up of genre flicks that's in on the joke\nenforcer heavy who just wants to\nfeel useful. March has been hired\nto investigate the reappearance of\nMisty, seen by her myopic aunt, and\nties it in with the disappearance of\nAmelia Kutner (Margaret Qualley);\nHealy, meanwhile, has been hired\nby Kutner to try and keep her\nwhereabouts unknown. The result is\nHealy turning up at March\u2019s door,\nand breaking his arm, almost in\nfront of his 13-year-old daughter\nHolly (Angourie Rice).\nIn the real world, that would be\nthe end of it (and at some point the\npolice would get involved \u2013 they\nnever really seem to do so; perhaps\nthe LAPD\u2019s funding was cut that\nyear),but because we are in neo-noir\nworld, a different set of rules apply.\nAfter Healy is assaulted in his office\nby two gun-toting goons looking\nfor Kutner, he teams up with March\nto try and track her down before\nshe is killed. What follows is a\nclassic screwball-style buddy movie:\nHealy\u2019s seasoned professionalism\nclashes with March\u2019s uncontrollable\nalcoholism \u2013 while the former cases\na joint looking for witnesses, the\nlatter just tries to find out where\nthe free bar is. Healy is disgusted\nby March\u2019s readiness to exploit\nhis needy clients, but is perfectly\nwilling to kill those in his way, a fact\npointed out by Holly, who is the\nmoral centre of the piece.\nCrowe gets his teeth stuck into\nhis role, bringing a sense of defeated\nnobility to Healy, a man blown\nalong by the vice-filled wind of L.A.\nHe plays Healy completely straight,\ntaking cues from the serious noirs\nof the 1940s and 50s. Gosling,\nin contrast, was clearly having a\ncomplete ball during the filming,\nand his infectious comedic energy\ncolours every scene he is in. After a\nrun of heavy, serious films, Gosling\nis showing us that he still retains the\ncomedy chops on show in Crazy,\nStupid, Love and Lars and the Real\nGirl. An effective comparison may\nbe drawn with Nicolas Winding\nRefn\u2019s 2011 thriller Drive, another\nL.A.-based neo-noir centred around\na nostalgic time period (while set in\nthe present, Refn\u2019s film is heavily\nlaced with 80s overtones); while\nGosling was near-mute in Drive,\ncommunicating only through body\nlanguage,in The Nice Guys he attacks\nthedialogueatfullthrottle,chucking\nout smart quips like a circus knife-thrower. He also skewers Crowe\u2019s\nover-the-top dialogue, which is\npure neo-noir ham: all dramatic\nmetaphors and grizzly anecdotes.At\none point, Healy makes reference to\na character \"dropping off his radar\",\nand March openly scoffs the use of\nsuch a po-faced term, revealing the\nludicrous nature of the predictable\ndialogue often found in a neo-noir.\nThe Nice Guys would work solidly\nas a straight neo-noir piece, one\nthat is enjoyable but ultimately\nforgettable. However, it is the way\nin which Black has approached the\nproject, with his tongue firmly in\ncheek throughout, threading the\nscenes with a heavy skein of irony,\nthat elevates this above standard\nfare. There are certain elements that\nfeel uneven \u2013 particularly the way\nBlack seems to be taking inspiration\nfrom every decade between the\n40s and the 80s \u2013 and a number of\nfight scenes could be cut: they were\nclearly supposed to be dramatic\ncentrepieces, however, where the\nfilm shines is the dialogue, and\nthese parts only seem to bloat the\nfilm. But look past these, focusing\non the chemistry between Gosling\nand Crowe, and the razor-sharp\nscreenplay, and The Nice Guys is\na rough gem of a film, shining\nthrough the L.A. smog.\nDocumentary corner: Portrait of Jason\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nA\nlong with bumblebees\nand pandas, another\nspecies that is seemingly\non the verge of\nextinction is the raconteur. The\nword, which reached its height of\npopularity in the mid-20th\ncentury,\nis used to describe a teller of tales:\nsomeone who can take an amusing\nsingular anecdote, and spin it into\na tale of gold, causing you to hang\nonto every word. Today, the closest\nthing the Western world has to\na true raconteur is director John\nWaters, aka 'The Pope of Trash'.\nThis raconteur spirit is what makes\nShirley Clarke\u2019s 1967 documentary\nPortrait of Jason such a compelling\nwatch.\nPortrait of Jason, as the name\nwould suggest, centres around\nJason Holliday, a black, gay, aspiring\ncabaret performer. Over the course\nof 12 hours, Clarke and her team\nask him questions about his life; his\nanswers are vague, laced through\nwith theatrical accounts of his early\nyears as a hustler on the streets\nof New York City. As the night\nprogresses, Clarke and her team\nbecome more and more hostile\ntowards Holliday, abusing him with\nracial slurs, in an attempt to get\nunderneath the exaggerated persona\nhe has adopted. The 12 hours of\nfootage are cut down to a much\nmore manageable 105 minutes,\nwith scenes floating in and out,\ncut together in a haze that gives an\ninebriated quality to the film.\nA pioneer of the cinema verite\nmovement, as well as a key player\nin the experimental film scene of\nthe mid-20st\ncentury, Portrait of\nJason may be Clarke\u2019s masterpiece.\nWeaving together fact and fiction,\nshe exploits the authenticity of\nthe documentary format \u2013 which\npromises a \u2018truth\u2019, if such a thing\ncan ever be achieved on film \u2013 by\nfilling it with the ramblings of a\nman for whom authenticity is a\nquick route to an early grave, a\nman who has had to learn to adapt\nand hide in order to stay safe. At\nthe same time, Clarke is playing a\ndangerous game, tiptoeing towards\nthe ethical code of professional\ndocumentarians, and smashing it\nto pieces. The scenes where her\nand her partner berate Jason are\nsome of the most uncomfortable\nthings I have witnessed in a\ndocumentary, producing a palpable\nsense of unease. Clarke seems to\nbe upending the conventions of\nthe direct cinema movement; by\nboth provoking her subject and\nmanipulatively editing together\nthe rushes she took over the twelve\nhours, she subverts the traditional\nrole of the documentarian (derived\nfrom documentum, the latin word\nfor \u2018proof\u2019, hinting at its structural\nimportance in the concept of truth-telling), who is supposed to use the\ncamera as a mechanical, all-seeing,\nall-consuming eye.\nPortrait of Jason not only shows the\ntrue power of a raconteur \u2013 a power\nthat can get one out of trouble just\nas often as it gets one in it \u2013 but\nClarke also highlights the force\nand weaknesses of the documentary\ngenre as a whole. Her and Jason\nleave no question unanswered, no\nstory unsaid.\nJason Holliday, who cuts a beguiling figure at the centre of Shirley Clarke's Portrait of Jason. Photo Credit: Project Shirley\nF\nor an anti-establishment\nradical, Ken Loach cuts\nan unlikely figure. A\npolite man approaching\n80, whose latest work, I, Daniel\nBlake, won the Palme d\u2019Or at this\nyear\u2019s Cannes, Loach is one of the\nworld's most feted directors, but his\ninoffensive appearance belies the\nraw power contained in his films.\nOver the last five decades,Loach has\nbeen directing films in a raw, realist\nstyle, which revolve around issues of\nsocial and political justice. As well\nas this year\u2019s Palme \u2013 his second\n\u2013 2016 sees the release of Versus:\nThe Life and Films of Ken Loach, a\ndocumentary charting his ups and\ndowns. In the film world, such a\nwork is equivalent to a retrospective\n\u2013 a crowning achievement capping\noff an illustrious career.\nOne of the key themes in both\nLoach\u2019s oeuvre and the film is\ncapital versus labour. Coming\nfrom a working-class, Northern\nbackground, Loach managed to\nattain a place at grammar school,\nand then went on to Oxford,\nwhere he was pushed up against\nthe children of the establishment,\nwhose privilege manifested itself\nas a sense of entitlement. Loach\nbegan his creative career at an\nauspicious time, when the BBC was\nexpanding its operations, setting\nup their Wednesday Play series, for\nwhich Loach directed ten films,\nincluding the lauded Cathy Come\nHome (1966), an unflinching look at\nhomelessness and its impact on the\nfamily structure which led to people\nfor years afterwards trying to give\nmoney to lead actor Carol White in\nthe street, convinced she really was\ndestitute.\nThe current climate in British\nculture cannot be ignored,and while\nthe documentary does point out\nthat Loach came out of \u2018retirement\u2019\nshortly after the most recent\nelection, much of the criticism of\nthe current system must be inferred.\nThe fact that the majority of the\nactors, screenwriters, and directors\nwho serve as talking heads in the\nfilm are working class strikes a\ncontrast to the typical cross-section\nof this generation of artists \u2013 think\nof Tom Hiddleston, Benedict\nCumberbatch, et al. This lack of\nworking class mobility, combined\nwith the current wholesale attack\non the BBC, makes one think that\nLoach is most definitely a product\nof his time, and would be unlikely\nto make it today.\nThe other main antagonism\nexplored is art versus commerce:\nLoach\u2019s refusal to waver from his\npolitical beliefs led to a number\nof his films being banned, and a\nperiod in the 1980s (the most fertile\ntime for protest, anger, and dissent)\nwhere he didn\u2019t have the money to\nwork at all.In order to make a living,\nhe directed adverts for \u2013 among\nothers \u2013 Nestl\u00e9 and McDonald\u2019s,\nsomething that still weighs heavy\non his conscience. Interviews with\nhis family help to break down the\nimage we have of Loach as a po-faced crusader, with his children\nbetraying his love of glossy musicals,\nwhich one daughter puts down to a\ndesire for escapism. Well, when the\nsubject matter you\u2019re working with\ntypically revolves around injustice,\nbrutality, and anger, a little bit of\nMGM glamour is excusable.\nThe film ends on a triumphant\nnote, with Loach\u2019s resurgence in\npopularity, following his first Palme\nd\u2019Or win in 2006 for Irish Civil\nWar film The Wind that Shakes the\nBarley. Director Louise Osmond\nsuggests that Loach may be more\nwell regarded in continental Europe\nthan the UK, a claim that has\nweight when we consider the home\nreaction to The Wind that Shakes\nthe Barley, which saw critic Simon\nHeffer compare Loach to Hitler,\ndespite not having seen the film.\nWhile the film was completed just\nbefore his most recent win, it makes\nan independent case for valuing\nLoach \u2013 one of this country\u2019s most\nvibrant, steadfast, and engaging\nfilmmakers.\nFRED FYLES\nThe radical director Ken Loach at work on his latest film.

Hockney moved to Los\nAngeles in 1966 and adopted a style\nof painting that would define the\nrest of his career.\nIn the 1967 painting, A Bigger\nSplash, Hockney conjures up a\nvision of Los Angeles that is\nhaunting. Bright, flat colours fill\nneat. clinically geometric shapes.\nOppressive Californian heat, rises\nfrom the red brick paving around\nthe pool and permeates the painting.\nThe hard lines are disturbed only\nby a scribble of white in the centre\nof the canvas. The viewer is left to\nimagine the identity of the unseen\ndiver who has left the splash in\ntheir wake. American Collectors is\nanother painting that is perfectly\nevocative of that particular Los\nAngeles glamour. Two figures, Fred\nand Marcia Weisman, she in a pink\nrobe, he in a funereal black suit\nstand stiffly amongst their modern\nart acquisitions. Their poses are stiff,\nas if they were cardboard cut-outs.\nAn undercurrent of sinisterness\nThe man himself. Photo Credit: The Guardian.\nAt its best,\nHockney's\nwork fizzes\nwith energy\nBright, flat\ncolours\nfill neat\nshapes,\noppressive\nCalifornian\nheat\npermeates\nthe canvas\nruns through the composition\nthe brightness is disquieting, An\natmosphere of money,boredom,and\ndisillusionment is palpable.\nIf Hockney\u2019s semi-na\u00efve style suits\nthe Los Angeles paintings perfectly,\nit is not so effective in his other\nworks. In the series A Bigger View,\nexhibited in 2012 at the Royal\nAcademy, he trades the West Coast\nsunshine for the more temperate\nclimes of his native Yorkshire.\nBright ceruleans are exchanged for\nbright viridians and huge canvases\ntacked together depict vistas of\nrolling hills outlined in navy blue,\nintersected by unspooling lilac\nribbons of country paths.The bright,\nbold, and flat colours, so effective\nin portraying Los Angeles become\nsaccharine sweet in their depiction\nof Yorkshire.\nThese landscapes are pure\nescapism, showing a nostalgic,\nidyllic view of the English\ncountryside, unravaged by any\nsigns of modernity. The choice of\ncolours and the brushstrokes make\nit clear that Hockney's style is not\na response to the landscape but an\ninflexible filter like tool he applies\nto whatever he sees before him.\nThe compositions are pretty, but\ncomfortable, entirely safe. They\nwould not look out of place on\na chocolate box or an illustrated\nedition of The Hobbit as pictures of\nTolkein\u2019s The Shire.\nThe most interesting of the bunch\nis May Blossom on the Roman Road,\nin which huge hawthorne bushes\ncome alive with blossom that looks\nlike writhing maggots desperate to\nbe free of the green foliage. Here,\nthere is an hint of menace that lends\ninterest. That the landscapes are so\nuninspiring are a shame because\nHockney's paintings of Eccleshill,\nagain in Yorkshire in the 1950s\nare evocative and filled with loose,\nseemingly effortless brushwork. By\ncomparison, his later work seems\ncontrived.\nIn A Bigger View, Hockney seems\nunable to move on from the past,\nboth from his own prior work and\nthat of artists he admires. Anything\nmore than a cursory glance of\nEarly Blossom, Woldgate reveals his\ninspirations, the bright colours, the\nbrushwork seem lifted wholesale\nfrom Van Gogh, but hold none of\nthe frenetic emotional depth of Van\nGogh's own work.\nDagny Corcoran by David Hockney. Photo Credit: Richard Schmidt/Royal\nAcademy\nBarry Humphrie by David Hockney. Photo Credit: Richard Schmidt/Royal\nAcademy\nVan Gogh is a frequent source of\ninspiration in Hockney\u2019s work, the\npen and ink linework in Mother,\nBradford (1978) is heavily influenced\nby Van Gogh\u2019s early work. Van\nGogh is far from the only influence;\nthe Paper Pool series is reminiscent\nof Matisse\u2019s Cut-Outs. The graphic\nsplash in A Large Diver (Paper Pool\n27) harkens back to the burst of\nlight that appear in Matisse\u2019s Icarus\n(1946).\nThese are\nescapist,\ncomfortable\npaintings\nwhich would\nnot look out\nof place as\nillustrations\nof The Shire\nHockney is\nnever able\nto step out\nof Picasso's\nshadow\nHockney\nis an artist\nwho has for\ndecades\nshown a\nknack for\nconnecting\nwith the\npublic\nHockney has spoken at length\nabout his love affair with Pablo\nPicasso's work.It has shaped a great\ndeal of his output, in particular the\n'joiners' series which encompassed\nhis output in the 1980s. In these\nworks, such as Pearblossom Highway\nHockney manipulates polaroids and\nphotographs into cubist collages. In\ndoing so however, he is never able\nto step out of Picasso's shadow to\nsay something new. The images\nfeel gimmicky and pastiche-like.\nA quick search of the Hockney\ntag on Instagram reveals a host of\nusers sharing their holiday pictures,\npictures of desks in the 'joiner' style.\nIn many instances only the content\nof the photographs, the hipster mug\nor finished geography homework\ngive away that Hockney could not\nhave created them: never a sign of a\nrobust artistic movement.\nHockneyhashadanextraordinarily\nprolific career,moving from medium\nto medium throughout his 50 year\ncareer. His latest project involved\niPad drawings, most notbaly of the\nYosemite National Park.\nIf there was any proof needed that\nHockney's work is overrated beyond\nparody in recent years, the response\nto these iPad drawings are it.\nWe've all heard the old addage\nthat a two-year-old could draw\nthat; often it is employed unjustly,\na two-year-old would not produce\na Jackson Pollock painting, and\nfine, neither would they produce a\nHockney if let loose on the drawing\napp, but a twelve-year-old might.\nIt's not the use of the iPad that's\nobjectionable, digital paintings\nare very often accomplished and\ngloriously beautiful, but Hockney's\nare anything but. These are\nconventional landscapes executed\npoorly, and what's worse exhibited\nwith a seriousness that defies belief.\nThese paintings are testament to the\ndecline of an once interesting artist.\nThe new show at the Royal\nAcademy is mercifully not filled\nwith iPad drawings but a series\nof acrylic portraits of Hockney's\nfriends and family.\nThe sitters appear against the the\nsame background of a mid blue,\nand turquoise, all seated in the\nsame chair. Hockney considers the\ndozens of portraits one cohesive\nwork, and it's clear how the\nbackground has been kept minimal\nand the same throughout to shift\nthe attention onto the sitters. For\nme, the background staying the\nsame does almost the opposite, the\nsitters take the role of the props,\nakin to light changing across a wall.\nThis is a shame, Hockney's portraits\nof his mother painted throughout\nhis career are emotional, deeply\npersonal paintings that reveal\nHockney's true skill at portraiture,\nby contrast the new paintings are\ncloser to illustrations.\nHockney is a prolific artist who\nhas for many years demonstrated\na knack for connecting with the\npublic. That is no mean feat, and\nnothing to sniffed at, but it has\nbecome and more apparent that as\nan artist he has little new to say.\nIt's interesting to speculate how\nhis work would've developed had\nhe not to moved to Los Angeles\nat the beginning of his career,\nor had continued to explore his\nsexuality in his work, even in his\npaintings of swimming pools, the\nmost evocative are of his then lover,\nPeter Schlesinger. These criticisms\nhave been levelled at Hockney\nover decades, which he brushes\noff with ease. His productivity far\nfrom declining over recent years,\nhas increased. This is to be admired,\nhe clearly creates work that many\npeople enjoy, and that in itself is\nsomething to be celebrated. All\nthe same, the retrospective at the\nTate will probably be more worth\nchecking out than the exhibition of\nnew work at the Royal Academy.\n\n"

Photo Credit: ICL\nT\nhe City and Guilds\nunion offered a novel\nway of recovering from\nexam stress relief last\nweek \u2013 playing with dogs.\nThe dogs, who were brought in by\nthe dog re-homing charity All Dogs\nMatter,sat in a room in CGCU,and\nstudents filed in all afternoon to\nplay with them.They also had a few\nwalks around campus.\nThis is the second time the CGCU\nhave offered puppy therapy to its\nmembers, and it\u2019s proved incredibly\npopular, with 300 sign-ups in 24\nhours for this session, and all the\nplaces being booked up last time\nthey ran the event as well.There was\nDog therapy for stressed\nstudents\nAs Crawley stated in his email,\nit is unlikely that these students\nwould be retroactively deemed\ninternational, and be forced to start\npaying \u00a326,000 halfway through\ntheir degrees.However,he reassured\nEU students college wouldn\u2019t just\nstart charging them more without\na fight, saying \u201cwe will do all in\nour legal power to ensure that\ncurrent students are not subject to a\ndramatic increase in fees\u201d.\nIf Britain were to leave, fewer EU\nstudents are likely to come to British\nuniversities,and those that do would\nprobably have to pay the higher fees.\nThis would mean there would be no\nfinancial cost to Imperial in terms\nof fee income, as it will either take\nmore home students for the same\nmoney or take more international\nstudents and make more cash.\nProfessor Crawley made no secret\nof how we will be voting in the\nreferendum. He said a leave vote\nwould spell bad news for funding\nresearch, the companies that mech\neng works with, enlisting students\nfrom the EU, and that therefore he\nwould be voting \u201caccordingly\u201d.\nHe told FELIX that remain\noffered \u201cease of collaboration\naround Europe, including student\nexchanges\u201d which \u201cis hugely\nimportant for the College\u201d.\n\u201cWe also benefit from being able\nto recruit research and academic\nstaff from EU countries without\nwork permit issues. We succeed\nby being open, and anything that\nincreases barriers is detrimental.\nI am also concerned that many of\nthe companies with whom we work\nwill scale back their UK activities\nand relocate to the continent to be\nwithin the single market. It is much\neasier to work with companies when\nthey are located closer to us.\u201d\nThis comes after Alice Gast,\nthe Imperial President, sent an\nemail out to all students and staff\nsaying how college could not tell\nits students how to vote, but that\nImperial had been involved with the\nremain campaign.\nStaff in the RSM took a different\nview, forwarding an email out to all\nstudents and staff from Imperial\u2019s\nBritain Stronger in Europe\ncampaign group, but adding they\nwere happy to send an email out\nfrom the equivalent pro-Brexit\ngroup.\nIn the email,\nhe said that\nseveral EU\nstudents had\nexpressed\nconcern\nsome queuing on the day, with some\nstudents from other departments\ngetting turned away . Millie Tsang,\nthe CGCU welfare officer said that\nhaving to turn people away was sad.\n\u201cOriginally I was met with heavy\ndoubts from within the CGCU and\nIC Union, who said it would not be\napproved and would also raise loads\nof trouble. Thankfully, I talked to\nCollege anyway,\u201d she told FELIX.\nDespite recently introducing a no\ndogs on campus rule, permission\nwas granted, with some limitations\nabout who could access the dogs\nand the room.\nStudents sat in a waiting room\nbefore getting their ten minutes with\nthe dogs, and in this time, students\nfrom different courses could mingle\nand chat to Millie about any welfare\nissues they were having.\nOne student arrived at the event\ndespite having a fear of dogs. In\ntheir feedback, they told CGCU: \u201cI\nreally think it is a great idea against\nstress and fear; the latter is also quite\ncommon and I\u2019m sure it could help\nmore students than just me\u201d.\nThanks to donations from\nstudents, CGCU also managed to\nraise several hundred pounds for the\ncharity providing the dogs.\nThis form of therapy is a firm\nfavourite at the LSE and Harvard.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nDogs during exam season proves huge hit with\nengineers\nMake my exams go away, puppy.

Photo Credit: Nic\nMcPhee\nMaking all science open access by 2020\nT\nhe EU Competitiveness\nCouncil, a committee\nincluding research,\nscience, and industry\nministers from all member\ncountries, announced last week that\nscientific publications should all be\nopen access by 2020. We all wish\nfor this to happen, but is the idea\nutopian?\nThere are many hurdles to\novercome. Firstly, there are no legal\nbindings. According to the council\nitself,it is only a\u201cpolitical orientation\nfor the 28 governments\u201d. Secondly,\nfour years is a very short period\nfor such a dramatic change in the\npublication process, especially when\nencountering strong resistance from\nthe private publishing industry\nwhose interests are at stake. Thirdly,\nthe actual details to achieve this goal\nhave yet to be announced.\nFELIX contacted private\nscientific publishing groups but they\nall declined to comment about the\nEU report. Through a spokesperson\nfrom the International Association\nof Scientific,Technical and Medical\nPublishers (STM), they announced\n\u201cit is vital that embargo periods\n(when articles are only available\nthrough paid subscriptions) be set\nat a sustainable level to enable the\nsubscription model to continue\nto support the operation of high\nquality journals\u201d.\nResearchers disagree, especially\nwhen it comes to matters of\npublic importance. According to\nProfessor Stephen Curry, a biologist\nhere at Imperial and open access\nadvocate, the slow release of articles\nis actually harmful. \u201cThere was\na recent initiative to encourage\npeople working on the Zika virus\nresearch to release their initial data\nand their results very quickly even\nin advance of publication. But we\nstill haven\u2019t moved to such a system\nfor antimicrobial resistance, HIV\ninfection and malaria, and that in\nitself have cost lives\u201d.\nAnother counter-argument is\nthe financial burden. \u201cThe upfront\ncosts for an immediate transition\nwill need to be covered. These costs\nwill currently fall disproportionally\non research-intensive countries that\nproduce more research relative to\nthe rest of the world,\u201d claims the\nSTM.\nHowever, it might be a fallacious\nargument. \u201cI think you have to\nrecognize that most of this research\nis publicly funded and all the money\nthat goes to pay for subscriptions\nat the minute is largely publicly\nfunded as well,\u201d commented Prof.\nCurry. \u201cBecause most of the work\nis publicly funded it has to be made\nopen access by right, and I think\nthere is enough money in the system\nto fund that. It is just a manner of\nmoving the accounts around\u201d.\nIt is already unlikely that universal\nopen access will be achieved by\n2020, but through incremental\nsteps in governmental policies\nand consensus we may slowly start\nto separate access to scientific\ninformation from corporate profits\nalthough that requires patience.\nThe Amazon river is one of\nthe most biodiverse fresh water\necosystems on the planet.The many\nfish species that call its water home\nthough are shrouded in mystery.\nA new study analysing otoliths,\nthe stone like bones located in fish\nears, might help us understand the\nmigratory routes of many species.\nThe research might potentially\nredefine our knowledge on many\nfish species especially in the cases\nof fish which are economically\nvalued and which regularly travel\nthrough the borders of multiple\nnations, such knowledge can be\ninvaluable, informing management\npolicies. The chemical composition\nof otoliths can reveal whether the\nfish has lived in 'black' or 'white'\nwater, as well as what the salinity of\nits habitat was.\nHerman et al. 2016 @ Royal Society\nOpen Science\nJane Courtnell\nScience Editor\nCan we control disease using\ncomputers? Researchers at\nthe Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology suggest yes, having\nintegrated digital and analogue\ncomputations into cellular DNA.\nDisease acts as an input to initiate\nmodule expression which turns gene\nsegments on or off,converting input\ninto an output,hence converting,say\nchemical concentrations to a simple\n0 or 1 signal. This biological circuit\nhas potential to cause the body to\ninitiate one of say three output\nresponses, in accordance to, for\nexample, blood glucose levels, thus\nacting as a diabetes control. Other\npotential uses include treatments for\ncancer, bowel disease, and probiotic\nbacteria development to treat gut\ndisease, with clinical trails for the\nlatter beginning in twelve months.\nLu et al. 2016 @ Nature\nCommunications\nFish ears yield\nsecrets\nAll hail genetic\ncomputers\nF\needing on gas, literally,\nis what astronomers at\nMassachusetts Institute\nof Technology have, for\nthe first time, detected.

For months, the EU\nreferendum has loomed large in a\ncollective public mind, bamboozled\nby potential impacts on everything\nfrom human rights to house prices.\nIt is a political hot potato that when\ndropped on the 23rd\nJune, could\nsee us out on our ear in the cold,\nlooking in through the window at\nthe EU planning their Christmas\nparty, wondering whether we have\ndone the right thing.\nBut above the cacophony of\nmultiple debates, what of Britain\u2019s\nunassailable drivers of modern\nprogress \u2013 science, healthcare,\nresearch? Enter Martin McKee,\nProfessor of European Public\nHealth at the London School of\nHygiene and Tropical Medicine\nand Professor Angus Dalgleish,\nFoundation Chair of Oncology at\nSt Georges University and Senior\nAdvisor to the pro-leave lobby\ngroup \u2018Scientists for Britain\u2019, who\nhave real problems agreeing.\nAs a champion of international\nhealth care, McKee\u2019s extensive\ntravel around the world engaging\nresearchers and policy makers in\nneglected health issues has led\nThe Lancet to comment that \u201ceven\nconversing with him is liable to\ncause jetlag\u201d. I am inclined to agree\nas I conduct our conversation over\nemail during his stopover between\nMexico and Miami.\n\u201cWould the world class status of\nour institutions falter without the\nbacking of the EU? Yes\u201d, he says.\nAnd the biggest threat to research?\n\u201cThe difficulties we would face in\nengaging with European networks,\n[\u2026], the difficulty with exchanges\nof staff, exclusion from EU science\nadvisory committees, [\u2026], we\nshould also not ignore the inevitable\ncut to science funding\u201d.\nMcKee is right \u2013 the EU has\nbrought us undeniable rewards. UK\nuniversities are huge beneficiaries\nof its research grants \u2013 (Imperial\nreceived \u00a348.8m in funding in 2014),\n200,000 UK students and 20,000\nUK staff have been able to work or\nstudy in Europe under the Erasmus\nscheme, our NHS is part-staffed\nby skilled non-British EU workers\nand cross-country clinical trials for\nrare diseases have been coordinated\nwhere small disease population sizes\nare a real issue. But it is far from\nperfect, with problems many and\nmanifest and questions about anti-democratic behaviour lingering.\nWhile this needs to be considered,\nin leaving, McKee argues, there is a\nreal risk that we would continue to\ncontribute to the EU from outside\nwhile relinquishing our place at the\nnegotiation table.\nDalgleish, on the other hand,\nholds less complimentary views of\nthe EU, labelling it a \u201csclerotic\u201d,\n\u201cdying organisation\u201d that is heading\nfor a \u201cheadlong crash into a\nwall\u201d.

We can\u2019t really decide. Photo Credit: ICU\nNext year our sabbs become the highest\npaid in the country\nBut they may actually be worse off than this year\u2019s group, and here\u2019s why\nN\next year\u2019s sabbs, who\nwere elected in March\nand take up their roles\nofficially this August,\nwill, on paper, become the best-paid full-time sabbatical officers in\nthe country. They\u2019ll have jumped\nfrom fourteenth highest-paid sabbs\nto the highest, beating last year\u2019s\nhighest, LSE, who pay a modest\n\u00a326,582 a year. Technically, these\nofficer trustee roles are getting a\n\u00a310,000 pay rise in the space of\none year (from \u00a319,500 this year to\n\u00a329,800).It sounds like a lot,but it\u2019s\nonly slightly higher than the 2013\nfigures for the average Imperial\ngrad\u2019s starting salary (\u00a329,200). If\nyou look at what the current sabbs\nget in terms of a remuneration\npackage, next year\u2019s cohort may\nactually be getting a worse deal.\nOur calculations\nLet\u2019s assume that this will be the\nfirst job next year\u2019s sabbs will be\ngetting paid for this tax year (we\u2019ve\nassumed that they\u2019re on the tax code\n1100L, if you\u2019re really interested).\nWe\u2019ve assumed that they are all\nhome students who took out student\nloans after 2012 and have finished\ntheir degrees, and so will now be\npaying back some of that loan every\nmonth. We\u2019re also assuming they\u2019re\nnot paying into the pension scheme.\nThis is all a little different for the\nFELIX editor, who is employed for\neleven and a half months, rather\nthan a year and a half like the\nfull-time officer trustees are (your\nDPWs and Union Presidents, for\nexample).\nTheir pay will now be \u00a329,800,\nand our calculations with the above\ntax code and assumptions using\nthesalarychecker.co.uk say that sabbs\nwill now be taking home \u00a322,600.\nSimilar calculations on this\nyear\u2019s salary (pre-2012 student\nloan repayments and the same tax\ncode) assume that take-home pay\nis currently \u00a316,200. Yes, obviously\ntwenty-two grand is way more than\nsixteen, but that\u2019s not the end of the\nstory.\nRemuneration package\nThe current remuneration package\n(i.e. extra stuff sabbs get \u2018paid\u2019 but\nnot in cash) includes a place in\nhalls. They do not have to pay rent;\nit\u2019s paid directly from the union\u2019s\ncoffers to the college\u2019s. And these\naren\u2019t the shitty cheap twin rooms in\nthe basement of Parsons. These can\nbe nice single ensuites in Eastside\nor Beit if the sabbs choose them\n(which several have).\nCurrently, if they don\u2019t want\nto live in halls, they can have a\ndocked amount of cash to live in\nhalls (typically 75% of what would\nhave been their halls budget, as an\nincentive to live in halls).\nAt least two sabbs this year have\nlived in Beit, so if we take the\nstandard 16/17 rents for an en suite\nroom (\u00a3220 per week) and take into\naccount the 54 weeks that they are\nemployed, they will need to pay\n\u00a311,880 worth of rent. Taken off\ntheir \u00a322,600 take home pay, sabbs\nchoosing to live in Beit would now\nonly get \u00a310,800,whereas sabbs now\ntake home \u00a316,200 after tax. This\nobviously means most sabbs will\nchoose to rent privately, and escape\nthe astronomical cost of Imperial\u2019s\nown accommodation, unless you\nwanted to live in the un-renovated\nside of Evelyn Gardens.\nTo put it another way, for next\nyear\u2019s sabbs to have the same amount\nof take-home cash as this year\u2019s,\nthey will have to spend just \u00a36400\non rent, which amounts to \u00a3120 a\nweek, for the 54 weeks they\u2019re paid.\nIt\u2019s certainly doable, but you\u2019re not\ngoing to be in South Kensington for\nthat kind of money.\nSo why this change?\nThis year\u2019s sabbs (the SandonAllum-Kaye-Howitt-WatsonChun-Yin-San year) were paid\n\u00a319,500 per year straight-up, and\nthen given either halls for \u2018free\u2019,\ni.e. as part of their remuneration\npackage, or 75% of the average\namount getting spent on putting up\nsabbs in halls. This cash for private\nrent was paid to the sabbs directly,\nso was taxed, meaning they got a\nsignificant hit if they chose to live\nout of halls.\nMany people saw this as a good\nthing, as having sabbs living in halls\nis arguably a benefit to freshers\n\u2013 everyone on the DPFS\u2019 floor\nknows what the union is \u2013 but the\nincentive for living in halls has now\nbeen completely removed, and from\nthe figures above you can see you\u2019d\nbe a mug to do it.\nDuring the Trustee Board\nmeeting in January at which the\nchange was decided, no sabbs were\nactually present. They were allowed\nto contribute to the discussion,\nbut asked to leave whilst the\nactual decision was made. The\nminutes of the meeting show that\nthe current sabbs said that \u201cthe\nfinancial compensation was not a\nmajor consideration when putting\nthemselves forward for the role\u201d,\nbut it could put future generations\nof students, who don\u2019t have saving\nor family money, off.\nDoes anyone care how much\nsabbs get paid, as long as they\u2019re\ndoing a good job? Well, we know\nthat Imperial has some of the best\ngraduate prospects in the country,\nso get the best people who aren\u2019t\nall from the same economic\nbackground,it\u2019s fair to make the pay,\nand all that comes with that, at least\nsemi-competitive.\nDoes\nanyone care\nhow much\nsabbs get\npaid, as long\nas they\u2019re\ndoing a\ngood job?\n\n"
