I think\nthe fact is,all we can do as a Union\nis present what they\u2019ve responded\nwith at face value and trust that all\nof you,as the best and brightest\nstudents in the country,can draw\nyour own conclusions on how much\nto trust the promises made.\nHow did we decide on the stances\nin the first place?\nWhen I was still a wide eyed council\nmember last year it was pointed out\nthat our Union stance on Higher\nEducation Funding was due to lapse.\nWith the election coming up in 2015\nand feelings on the issue pretty raw\nfrom the tripling of fees in direct\ncontravention of some campaign\npromises we wanted to make sure\nthat we got a new policy in place.\nFor those that don\u2019t know Council\nis the top policy making board in\nthe Union (with the exception of\nthe Trustees themselves) it\u2019s made\nup of about 60 positions including\nrepresentation from all the faculties\nand departments,the liberation\nofficers,the sabbatical officers and a\nnumber of ordinary members.\nCouncil last year decided to\nask the wider student body what\nthey thought,and ran our Higher\nEducation Funding survey to find\nout what you think is a fair price to\npay for a university education.\nThe survey went through three or\nfour drafts; which went to council\nfor further input and was then\nrevised several times to make it\nbalanced and improve the amount\nof time that could be taken.We\nreceived about 300 responses to the\nsurvey,which were then presented\nto the Union General Meeting before\nChristmas.Although under quorate,\nthose in attendance engaged in\na healthy discussion and a new\nproposed stance taken to Council for\nstudents to finally agree on.\nEventually,we had our stance; we\nagreed that Imperial College Union\nofficially supports significantly\nreduced tuition fees,alongside\nsome other measures.\nThe stance has a really strong\nmandate and a balanced position\nwith lobbying targets within college,\nwithin the government and,perhaps\nmost notably,for the Election\nCampaign.\nI\u2019m really proud of the result; you\ncan still see it\nat imperialcollegeunion.org/\npolicies.\nALEX SAVELL\nHow is the Union lobbying MPs this year?\nIf you paid attention to your\nnews feed in the last week, the\nlikelihood is that the story of the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)\nspending \u00a340,000 on a campaign\nagainst the Liberal Democrats has\ncome across your radar.\nThe most iconic of the posters\ndisplays two clenched fists, with\nthe words \u2018liar liar\u2019 tattooed across\nthe knuckles with the first \u2018I\u2019 being\npointed with the Liberal democrat\nlogo. The NUS describes the campaign\nas seeking to end the \u201ccycle of broken\npromises.\u201d\nTheir website describes how\n\u201cIn 2010 hundreds of thousands\nof students were abandoned by\npoliticians who broke their promise\non tuition fees\u2026 They traded lies for\npower.\u201d\nThe main purpose of the campaign\nis to encourage students to vote\nagainst MPs who broke their pledges\nnot to raise tuition fees, although the\nposters are specially targeting the\nLiberal Democrat party, something\nsome students aren\u2019t too happy about.\nCritics are keen to point out that\nother MPs too broke similar pledges,\nbut were not necessarily members of\nthe same party. Other members of the\nNUS are questioning the necessity\nof such expenditure on what is being\ncalled \u201ca political smear campaign.\u201d\nThe campaign has received even\nmore press due to the fact that\nnational rail has refused to display\nthe billboards for any longer,\nemphasizing that it has no expressed\ndesire to have a political opinion as a\ncompany.\nOne commentator online suggested:\n\u201cThe NUS need to stay politically\nneutral. Why should our union fees\ngo towards pushing a political agenda\nwe never said we support?\n\u201cFurthermore why does the NUS\nact as if they speak on behalf of all\nstudents?\u201d\nJoseph Miles, a PPE final year\nstudent at Wadham college\nrecently saw his counter campaign,\n#trolltheNUS, go viral, after sharing a\npage on facebook named: \u201c\u201cTroll the\nNUS executive; donate to the Liberal\nDemocrats!\u201d\nHe told the Oxford Student: I never\nexpected the #trollNUS campaign\nto take off like this. When I heard of\nthe #liarliar campaign, and having\nseen the NUS\u2019s increasingly desperate\nattempts to plug it on social media,\nI started the Facebook event\u2026as a\njoke and invited several people who I\nknow are Lib Dems at Oxford.\n\u201cI do think the NUS has a problem\nwith accountability, and its internal\nstructures are almost impossible to\nunderstand.\n\u201cClearly I am not the only person\nwho thinks that the NUS has become\ndominated by small internal cliques\nwho are nowhere near representative\nof the entire student body.\u201d\nAn article on the Liberal Democrat\nVoice website, targeted for Lib Dem\nsupporters, pointed out that the\ncampaign is not endorsing those\nMPs that did keep to their pledge.\nThey also asked: \u201cWhere was their\ncampaign against Labour MPs who\nintroduced tuition fees and top-up\nfees when they said they wouldn\u2019t?\u201d\nSome are more sympathetic to\nthe cause; many commentators who\nsympathised with the campaign,\nciting the fact that the student\npopulation needs to be reminded\nof the broken promises, and even\noffering the point that this campaign\nwill put more pressure on the Labour\nparty to follow through with their\nplan of reducing tuition fees.\nWhen I contacted Brian Alcorn,\nPresident of the Lincoln Student\nUnion and a heavily involved\nmember of the NUS, he did offer\nthe fact that the campaign was\noriginally voted on at last years\nNUS Conference in the form of a\nmandate to hold those who raised\nthe tuition fees accountable: \u201cIn the\ngrand scheme of things, it\u2019s not a lot\nof money, and we did vote on it last\nyear,\u201d he told Felix.\nDespite the protests, however, three\nmore billboards are planned to be\nput up at London Victoria, Sheffield\nCentral, and Manchester Piccadilly\nfrom midnight Wednesday until\nMay 8.\nThe NUS leader Toni Pearce cited\nlarge amount of bitterness within the\nstudent population: \"Students queued\nto vote for the Lib Dems in 2010 on\nthe sole basis of this pledge. It wasn't\na minor misdemeanour. It was an\noutright lie. We have an obligation\nto hold them to account for this, and\nwe will.\"\nWill the billboards even make\na difference to student voting?\nAlthough it is too soon to tell, they\nare certainly generating debate\naround the topic, which can only be\nseen as good thing.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 11\nFELIX 01.05.2015\nEverything you need to know to cast your vote\nThe General Election 2015\nStudents are taking to the campaign trail too\nAs a member of the Liberal Youth,\nI was invited to go canvassing in\nvarious target seats in the country.\nIt\u2019s a great scheme where they give\nyou some money towards travel,\nfree accommodation and food and\nthere\u2019s a social to cap things off at\nthe weekend.\nI went to the marginal seat of\nOxford West and Abingdon where\nImperial alumna Layla Moran was\nstanding.It was a great experience\nto find out the inner workings of\npolitical campaigning behind the\nscenes.\nI was briefed on the local issues\nand the work Layla has been doing\nover the past few years.Then we\nwere paired up and started knocking\non doors.What I found is that in an\nultra marginal seat people are more\nlikely to want to engage in doorstep\nconversations although some were\nquite shy about expressing the party\nthey are going to vote for.\nThis constituency had a right\nwing Tory MP in the last parliament\nwho voted against bills such as gay\nmarriage so the Liberal voice wasn\u2019t\nsuch a hard sell.Lib Dems have\ntraditionally banked on strong local\nconnections and it showed here as\nsome people commented that they\nhave heard more about Layla and\nher work in the constituency than\ntheir MP.It was quite refreshing to\nsee people actively willing to engage\nin politics and give their views on\nNHS,education and housing.\nThe weekend also gave me a\nchance to chat to Layla about her\njourney from Imperial to politics.\nShe highlighted the need for\nobjective decision making in politics\ncompared to the ideological policies\nthat are often pursued by the\npolitical parties.\nShe spoke in a friendly manner\nand was very willing to discuss party\npolitics with me during lunch.As\na current school teacher she had a\nvery good insight into the education\npolicies needed in this country and\nwas committed to making a positive\nimpact.Education inequality is an\nissue close to my heart and it was\ngreat to learn about the steps the\nparty is taking to address the issue.\nI have always felt a certain\ndegree of political apathy at\nImperial,perhaps it\u2019s the nature\nof our courses and the ideological\nshowmanship from the political\nparties that puts us off from\nactively engaging in politics.\nNevertheless,it\u2019s important that\nwe exercise our right to vote and\nmake our voices heard in elections.\nEngaging actively with political\nparties is the best way to influence\npolicymaking and truly make a\ndifference in people\u2019s lives.\nThe Lib Dems policies are\nvoted on at conference and any\nmember can put forward a policy\nmotion to be debates.This gives\nan excellent opportunity for\ngrassroots campaigners to have\na say at the national level.And\nthe truth is it works.The Lib Dem\npolicy delivered in this parliament\nof income tax cut was originally\nproposed at conference by an\nordinary member.\nSo it\u2019s important that we actively\nengage and campaign to get\na better understanding of the\nissues facing our society and do\nsomething about solving it.\nPLABON SAHA\nImperial\u2019s local constituencies explained\nJACK STEADMAN\nNEWS WRITER\nThe majority of students at\nImperial (especially those\nin halls) are concentrated\nin the four constituencies of\nChelsea and Fulham, Kensington,\nHammersmith, and Cities of London\nand Westminster. Felix takes a look at\neach of them below.\nHammersmith\nHammersmith is currently\nrepresented by the Labour Party\u2019s\nAndy Slaughter, the Shadow Justice\nMinister. Slaughter was previously\nMP for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd\u2019s\nBush from 2005-2010 and is running\nfor a second term (his third overall) in\nthe 2015 election.\nThe latest polling data suggests\nLabour will take 49% of the vote,\nwith the Conservatives in second\nwith 33%. With a Labour-led council\nin the Hammersmith and Fulham\nborough, Hammersmith is a fairly\nsafe seat for Labour.\nSlaughter\u2019s main campaigns\nrevolve around the A&E closures\nin West London, the potential for\na third runway at Heathrow, the\nhousing crisis and the demolition of\nShepherds Bush market.\nThe first campaign is particularly\nrelevant for Imperial students, in\nmore ways than one. The proposed\ndemolition of Charing Cross will\nmean many students nearest hospital\nbecomes (St Mary\u2019s in Paddington) or\nChelsea and Westminster, with only\nthe former having a full-blown A&E\ndepartment.\nAny changes to Charing Cross\nwill likely also impact on medical\nstudents, many of whom study in the\nhospital throughout their clinical\nyears.\nChelsea and Fulham\nChelsea and Fulham is currently\nrepresented by the Conservative\nParty\u2019s Greg Hands, the Deputy Chief\nWhip of the Coalition government.\nHands was previously MP for\nHammersmith and Fulham from\n2005-2010 and is running for a\nsecond term (also his third overall) in\nthe 2015 election.\nCurrent polling data suggests Hands\nwill be returned to the government\nwith a 60% share of the vote, with\nthe Labour candidate coming in\nsecond with 25% of the vote. Despite\nincluding wards from the Labour\nHammersmith and Fulham borough,\nChelsea and Fulham is a very safe seat\nfor the Conservatives.\nHands\u2019 policies echo those of\nthe Conservative Party in general,\nas he has endorsed the party\u2019s\nmanifesto. Most of the key pledges\naren\u2019t particularly relevant for\nmost students, as they focus on\nearlier stages of education, pensions,\napprenticeships and changes to\nInheritance Tax and the higher rate\nof Income Tax.\nOther promises highlighted by\nHands include increased spending\non the NHS and lifting the cap on\nuniversity places.\nCities of London and\nWestminster\nCities of London and Westminster\nhas been represented since 2001 by\nthe Conservative Party\u2019s Mark Field.\nCurrent polling shows Field will\nlikely be returned with 53% of the\nvote, continuing the constituency\u2019s\ntrend of returning the Conservative\ncandidate in every election since\nits inception in 1950. Labour are\npredicted to come second with 24% of\nthe vote.\nField has run campaigns on\nmultiple topics affecting constituents,\nincluding funding of hospitals,\npolicing issues, housing problems,\nas well as those affecting the city at\nlarge, not least transport.\nKensington\nKensington was represented\nuntil 2015 by Malcolm Rifkind of\nthe Conservative Party, who is not\nseeking to retain his seat in the 2015\nelection.\nThe candidates standing in\nKensington from the major parties\nare Dr Rodwan Abouharb (Labour),\nVictoria Borwick (Conservative),\nRobin McGhee (Liberal Democrats),\nJack Bovill (UKIP) and Robina Rose\n(Green).\nCurrent polls show Victoria\nBorwick being elected for the\nConservatives with 51% of the vote,\nwith Labour on 19% and the Liberal\nDemocrats on 15%.\nFelix spoke to each of the candidates\nfor Kensington, asking them why we\nshould vote for them and their party,\nand their responses are printed below.\nDr Rodwan Abouharb (Labour)\ntold us \u201cresidents need an advocate\nnot only locally, but also nationally\nin parliament making a strong case\nfor government to understand and\naddress the needs of all communities\nliving in Kensington.\nWhen you head off to the polling\nstation on 7 May, your choice is\nsimple. Will you vote for the self-interest of the few, or for the good of\nthe many of One Kensington?\u201d\nVictoria Borwick (Conservative)\nsaid \u201cI was born in this constituency\nand spent my life here. Over the past\nseven years on the Greater London\nAuthority and two years working as\nBoris\u2019s deputy, I have worked hard to\npromote innovation and enterprise\nin this great city. I\u2019m passionate about\nLondon and its residents.\nIf you vote for me, I and a\nConservative government would\nfight to keep the economy on track,\ncontinue to create jobs and secure a\nbright future for young people living\nin Kensington today.\u201d\nRobin McGhee,(Liberal Democrats)\nsaid \u201cthe Liberal Democrats want\nto do something about the housing\ncrisis. Housing is the most important\nissue facing young people in London\ntoday. We need urgent action now to\nensure our generation doesn\u2019t get left\nbehind.\u201d\nJack Bovill (UKIP) told us that \u201cthe\nonly reason to vote for me, the UKIP\nCandidate in Kensington, is that I\ncare for open access to learning of\neveryone in this land, particularly\nwhere the learning is structured and\nled by teachers of renown.\u201d before\nquoting George Orwell.\nRobina Rose, Green did not submit\na response before Felix went to print.\n\n"

Mr Farage also\npledged to cut the foreign aid budget,\nstop the HS2 \u201cvanity project\u201d and\nrevisit the Barnett formula because\n\u201cScotland should receive less than it\ncurrently does.\u201d\nFarage said that the NHS \u201cshould\nrun as a public service, free at the\npoint of access\u201d and promised\nto reverse the growth of middle\nmanagement and scrap hospital\nparking charges.\nMr Farage raised the topic of health\ntourism, saying that foreign workers\nshould have health insurance before\nthey arrive here.\nShortly after this Mr Farage\nbrought up the 7000 HIV cases in the\nUK, and claimed that \u201calmost half\u201d\nof the patients were from overseas.\nWhen he Leanne wood gets the first\nround of applause for condemning\nhis words.\nFarage repeatedly claimed that\n\u201cwe can\u2019t do anything\u201d to control\nimmigration and said that he doesn\u2019t\nblame a single migrant for coming\nhere.\nHe highlighted issues such as wage\ncompression and the housing crisis,\nbut steered clear of the economy\nand focused on immigration and\nour EU membership as priorities\nfor the UK. Mr Farage attacked the\nsix pro-European leaders, calling\nthem \u201cdetached\u201d, \u201call the same\u201d and\ndeclaring they have \u201cnever had a job\nin their lives.\u201d\nLeanne Wood \u2013 Plaid Cymru\nPlaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood\nstressed that \u201cjobs and services have\nbeen cut to the bone\u201d and declared\nthat \u201cthe austerity experiment has\nfailed.\u201d\nSpeaking directly to the Welsh\nvoters, she promised to offer an\nalternative to \u201cbalancing the books on\nthe backs of the poor.\u201d\nLeanne Wood relentlessly criticised\nausterity, saying that \u201cdebt has gone\nup despite promises\u201d to produce \u201cso\nmuch pain for so little gain.\u201d At one\npoint the Plaid Cymru leader told\nthe audience that \u201cthe banks had a\nbailout, now it is time for the people\nto have a bail out.\u201d\nIn the next parliament Plaid Cymru\nwill demand that Wales receive (per\ncapita) fiscal parity with Scotland.\nLeanna Wood criticised Labour\nfor the \u201ccreeping privatisation\u201d and\nthe introduction of PFIs (private\nfinance initiatives). She contended\nthat the \u201cprivate sector has no role in\nhealthcare.\u201d\nIn response to Farage\u2019s comments\non immigration, the Plaid Cymru\nleader asserted that the United\nKingdom would not go along with\nthe \u201cscaremongering\u201d and \u201cdivisive\nrhetoric.\u201d\nIn closing, Leanne Wood\nunderlined that \u201causterity is not\ninevitable.

A peaceful political\nrevolution.\u201d\nBut just how well was this all\nreceived?\nSnap polls suggested that Nicola\nSturgeon and David Cameron\nhad come out on top, but for very\ndifferent reasons. Many liked the\naggressive and impassioned rhetoric\ncoming from Sturgeon, who attacked\nMiliband for not being left enough.\nDavid Cameron remains the most\n\u2018prime ministerial\u2019 in the public\u2019s\neyes, after he gave a calm and\nconvincing argument for voting\nConservative.\nEd Miliband also came out strong\nform the debate. He has the most to\ngain from participating in a head to\nhead debate with David Cameron,\ndue to the expectation game. The\nConservatives and the press have\nhugely exaggerated Miliband\u2019s poor\nimage and the debates give him an\nopportunity to confront Cameron\nand look the part.\nHowever, in the seven-way\ndebate he had little time to clash\nwith Cameron, and had to spent\njust as much time being criticized\nby Sturgeon, Bennett and Wood\nfor Labour\u2019s support for further\nausterity.\nNick Clegg, arguably one of the best\nspeakers on the panel, came out with\nsome appealing lines on why to vote\nLib Dem, and successfully positioned\nhimself away from his coalition\npartner. Painting a picture as the\nparty that would \u201cadd a heart to a\nConservative government and a brain\nto a Labour one\u201d might chime with\nthe electorate, but Clegg\u2019s image is\ntainted with large chinks of the public\nafter the tuition fee debacle.\nNigel Farage gave a pretty poor\nperformance and caused controversy\nhis comments on immigrants\nsuffering from HIV. Natalie Bennett\nand Leanne Wood both had their\nmoments that won over the audience,\nmainly on the subjects of inequality\nand the \u201cfailed austerity experiment,\u201d\nand the three women leaders were\nvery much in agreement on the issues.\nHowever, as the best debater of the\nthree, Nicola Sturgeon stole Bennett\u2019s\nand Wood\u2019s thunder.\nThere were no major gaffes or\ngame changing moments during the\ndebate, and the two-hour discussion\nprobably didn\u2019t change many people\u2019s\nperceptions of the party leaders,\nexcept now there might be a large\nnumber left-wing English voters\nwho wish they could vote for Nicola\nSturgeon.\n\n"

With another long-winded, lack lustre display from\nthe Orange Tree, I am starting to lose\npatience with Paul Miller\u2019s tenure at\nthis fantastic theatre.\nA rare early work by the Nobel\nPrize winning Doris Lessing, Each his\nown Wilderness is branded a play about\npolitics with all the passion usually\nreserved for sex. Although there are\na number of interesting and lively\npassages, the piece is let down by an\nunnecessarily long runtime and a lack\nof coherence in deciding its theme.\nSet in 1958 London, 22 year old\nTony returns from National Service\nto find his mother, Myra, the same\nbohemian activist she\u2019s always been.\nCold and disillusioned, Tony\u2019s anger\nand deep political scepticism provides\na lively contrast to his mother\u2019s\nidealism.\nWith a supporting cast made up of\nMyra\u2019s current and former lovers,\nthe whole political spectrum is\nentertainingly represented. Despite\nthe political topic of choice - the\nH-bomb - having somewhat lost\nits significance in the last 50 years,\ndiscussion on the indifference of the\nyoung to politics and the futility of\nprotest movements stays remarkably\nrelevant today.\nUnfortunately, while the play\u2019s\npolitical message is rather enjoyable\n(for those who can stand politics), the\nrelationship between Tony and his\nmother falls a little flat. Unpleasant\nand bitter, Tony\u2019s anger comes across\nas distinctly adolescent, despite a\nsuperb performance by young RADA\ngraduate Joel MacCormack. Similarly,\nClare Holden works well in the role of\nMyra, but both characters are plagued\nby a lack of development from start\nto finish.\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that a number\nof the supporting roles are a little\nsubpar. Roger Ringrose as Mike plays\na na\u00efve, elderly Labour politician who\nhas been openly in love with Myra for\nyears. His performance is what one\nwould expect from such a character\nbut remains rather unexciting. In\ncontrast, Phillip, played by John\nLightbody, is a successful architect\nwith the confidence to match. Having\nhad a five year relationship with\nMyra previously, Myra\u2019s longing for\nhim is entertaining but adds little to\nthe play.\nFor the first half, the cast is closed\nout by Sandy, Myra\u2019s 22 year old\nlover, and Rosemary, a young girl\nengaged to Phillip. In truth, Sandy\u2019s\ncharacter is remarkably refreshing;\nthe same age as Tony, but without all\nthe unpleasant cynicism, he provides\nsome urgently needed relief in the\nearly parts of the play. But the real\nnail in the coffin for this production\nis Rosemary. Incredibly uninteresting\nand childish, it seems Rosemary\u2019s\ncharacter has been written into\nthe play for the sole purpose of\ndemonstrating what it\u2019s like to be\npolitically clueless. I really can\u2019t\nblame Rosie Holden\u2019s performance\nsince the character she is given to\nwork with is dire, but she does little to\nfind any redeeming features.\nThe play seems to ramble on stuck\nsomewhere between the political\nand personal for the full two and\na half hour runtime. Without\nseeming to reach much of a political\nconclusion and with Tony and Myra\u2019s\nrelationship as frayed at the start\nas at the finish, it all feels a little in\nvain. The only real highlight, apart\nfrom the brief political commentary\nalready mentioned, is Susannah\nHarker as Milly, Sandy\u2019s mother and\nanother Bohemian friend of Myra.\nSharp, witty and with a far more\nreasonable tone than many of the\nothers, Milly livens up the second\nhalf. Although there is a fair bit of\ntongue in cheek in the first half,\nMilly\u2019s arrival really sets the ball\nrolling for the more comedic side of\nthe play.\nDespite what I\u2019ve said, I don\u2019t\nwant to give the impression that this\nproduction is an outright failure.\nParticular praise must be handed to\nJoel MacCormack whose performance\nreally is exceptional given what\nhe had to work with. Equally, the\nperformances of Josh Taylor as\nSandy and Susannah Harker are\nfun and refreshing. The staging and\nscenery makes good use of the space\nat the Orange Tree, and although the\nplay\u2019s more intimate moments are\na little lost in the round, the general\natmosphere is enlivening.\nUnfortunately, little can be done\nto redeem the shaky plot and lack of\ndevelopment in this frankly under\nwhelming play. It certainly wasn\u2019t\nterrible, it wasn\u2019t even particularly\nbad, I just expected so much more\nfrom the Orange Tree.\nEach his Own Wilderness is on at the\nOrange Tree Theatre until May 16th.\nTickets from \u00a310.

They\nintend to pay for this through\ncutting down on tax evasion\nand avoidance, further austerity,\nand putting measures in place\nto promote growth in the North,\nMidlands, South West and East\nEngland, partially through\ndevolution to elected mayors.\nHealthcare\nThe Tories\u2019 headline pledge in\nhealthcare is to provide 7 day\naccess to GPs by 2020, but they\nhave also pledged to fund in full\nthe request of \u00a38 billion by NHS\nEngland. Further therapists\nfor those with mental health\nconditions will be introduced, and\nhealth and social care systems will\nbe joined up using a \u00a35.3 billion\nfund.\nEducation\nAnnounced as part of a previous\nBudget, a postgraduate loan\nsystem will be introduced for\ntaught masters and PhD courses.\nThe Conservatives will also lift\nthe cap on university places,\ncreate enterprise zones around\nuniversities to promote spinouts,\nand invest more money in online\neducation.\nWelfare\nMuch debate has been had in the\npress over where the Conservatives\nwill cut \u00a312 billion from the\nwelfare budget. They intend to\ndo this in part through freezing\nworking age benefits, excluding\ndisability benefits, for the first two\nyears of the Parliament.\nIn addition, the benefit cap will be\nreduced by \u00a33,000 to \u00a323,000 but\ndisability living allowance and the\npersonal independence payment\nwill continue to be exempt.\nLABOUR\nEconomy\nThe front page of Labour\u2019s\nmanifesto pledges to obtain a\nsurplus on the current budget\nas soon as possible. This differs\nfrom the Conservatives\u2019 policy,\nas they pledge to eliminate the\nentire deficit, while Labour\u2019s\npledge still allows them to borrow\nfor infrastructure investment\n\u2013 capital projects. Labour also\npledges not to increase personal\ntaxes, but will reintroduce the\n50p tax rate, and abolish the \u201cnon\ndom\u201d status which allows some\npeople to not pay UK tax on their\nearnings outside the UK. The\nminimum wage will be increased\nto more than \u00a38 an hour by late\n2019, and zero-hours contracts\nwill be banned. A mansion tax will\nalso be introduced.\nHealthcare\nLabour have not pledged the full\n\u00a38 billion requested by Simon\nStevens, head of NHS England,\nhowever they have pledged \u00a32.5\nbillion to pay for more GPs,\nnurses, and midwives, as well\nas look to provide the money if\nthey can make it available. They\nalso pledge to put mental health\non the same priority as physical\nhealth, repeal the Health and\nSocial Care Act, cap profits made\nby private operators in the NHS,\nand guarantee GP appointments\nwithin 48 hours.\nEducation\nTuition fees will be cut to \u00a36,000\nfor home and EU students, and\nprovide more in-depth careers\nadvice for school students to help\nthem decide between university\nand apprenticeships.\nWelfare\nLabour will abolish the Bedroom\nTax, also known as the Spare\nRoom Subsidy, and impose rules\nwhere migrants cannot claim\nUK benefits until they have been\nresident for at least two years.\nEveryone over 25 out of work\nfor at least two years will be\nguaranteed a job, which must be\ntaken (those under 25 will wait\nonly one year).\nrolled out.\nLIB DEMS\nEconomy\nThe Lib Dems will continue to\nbalance the country\u2019s current\nbudget, like Labour allowing\nborrowing for investment. They\nwill do this by April 2018. In\naddition, an extra tax charge will\nbe levied on banks to raise money\nto clear the deficit (after which it\nwill be removed). A mansion tax\nwill be introduced on properties\nworth over \u00a32 million, the\namount of money you can earn\nbefore income tax raised to at least\n\u00a312,500, and additional work to\ncut down on tax avoidance.\nHealthcare\nThe Lib Dems will provide the\n\u00a38 billion requested by NHS\nEngland, and will also provide\nmoney for the rest of the United\nKingdom. \u00a3500 million will be\nprovided for mental health care,\nwith an aim to get waiting times\ndown to 6 weeks for depression\nor anxiety, and 2 weeks for a first\nepisode of psychosis. GP surgeries\nwill be open in evenings and\nweekends, with phone and Skype\nappointments also made available.\nA \u201cPatient Premium\u201d will be\nintroduced in disadvantaged areas.\nEducation\nHigher education finance reforms\nwill be reviewed and changed\nwhere needed, with a focus on\nliving costs. The review will also\ncover postgraduate courses. The\nLib Dems will also look into\ncreation of a student contract, and\nwill aim to widen participation\nthrough summer schools,\nmentoring, and transparency in\nselection criteria.\nWelfare\nUniversal Credit will be\nintroduced, and the minimum\nwage increased at a rate which\ndoes not slow down job creation.\nThe Work Programme will be\nreformed \u2013 the Lib Dems claim it\ncurrently ignores people who have\nnot found work but stop claiming\njobseeker\u2019s allowance.\nGREEN\nEconomy\nThe Green Party reject austerity,\nwill renationalise the railways, and\nwill borrow to invest. Zero hours\ncontracts will be banned, and the\nminimum wage increased to \u00a310\nan hour by 2020. The working\nweek will be set to a maximum\nof 35 hours. A 60p tax rate will\nbe introduced at \u00a3150,000, and\npeople worth \u00a33m or more will\nbe subject to a wealth tax of 2%.\nFinally, a financial transaction tax\nwill be introduced.\nHealthcare\nThe Greens have trumped the\nother parties and have pledged to\nincrease the NHS budget by \u00a312\nbillion. Social care will be, in some\ncases, free of charge, and resources\nwill be provided to make mental\nhealth a much high priority. The\nHealth and Social Care Act will be\nrepealed, and the Private Finance\nInitiative method of building new\nNHS buildings (where the private\nsector builds the building and\nleases it back to the NHS).\nEducation\nTuition fees will be scrapped\nand debt cancelled for all\nundergraduate courses, with grants\nreintroduced. The Greens will\nalso consider scrapping tuition\nfees for postgraduate courses.\nState funding will be reintroduced\nfor all courses, and fossil fuel\ndivestment will be encouraged\nacross all universities.\nWelfare\nThe Basic Income \u2013 a fixed income\npaid to every individual \u2013 will\nbe consulted upon. In the mean\ntime, the Green Party will end\nworkfare (where people work for\nbenefits) and the bedroom tax. In\naddition, half a million new social\nrented homes will be introduced\nby 2020. The carers allowance will\nbe increased by 50%, and child\nbenefit doubled.\nUKIP\nEconomy\nThe amount of money you can\nclaim before paying income tax\nwill be increased to \u00a313,000, and\ninheritance tax will be abolished.\nIn addition, UKIP will introduce\na 30p tax rate starting somewhere\nin between \u00a343,500 and \u00a355,000.\nUKIP have also pledged to change\nhow VAT works upon withdrawal\nfrom the EU, including removal\nof VAT from sanitary products,\nand will introduce rules to\nensure companies cannot avoid\ncorporation tax in the UK. The\nBarnett Formula which allocates\nfunding in Scotland, Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland will be replaced,\nand the deficit eliminated.\nHealthcare\nUKIP will fund 8,000 more GPs,\n20,000 more nurses and 3,000\nmore midwives. They will also\nincrease mental health funding\nby \u00a3170 million, to improve\nprovision of mental health\nservices, and will trial a scheme\nof putting GPs in A&E so those\nwith actual emergencies see an\nemergency doctor.\nEducation\nTuition fees will be waived for\nstudents studying STEM subjects\nand medicine who remain in\ntheir discipline in the UK for at\nleast 5 years. The target aiming\nto get 50% of school leavers into\nuniversity will be abolished,\nand EU students will not receive\ntuition fee loans.\nWelfare\nUKIP will remove the bedroom\ntax and will end the current\nWork Capability Assessments for\ndisability benefits and move the\ntests to GPs and consultants.

Though equally respected\nby his enemies as by his supporters, a\ncertain stubbornness and radicalism\nhas alienated many. For instance,\nin 1952 he declared in one fell\nswoop half of the musical world as\nuseless, in 1967 that opera houses\nshould be blown up, and in 1971 he\nadvocated for the destruction of\nthe Mona Lisa. But read past these\nshocking soundbites and you may\nfind yourself in fact following his\narguments. Indeed the vast literature\nhe has produced throughout his\ncareer has swayed many, undoubtedly\ninfluencing the course of music\nhistory, and it certainly does display\na penetrating and unabashed\nintelligence. Of course, his music is\nthe true testament to this: original,\nendlessly thought provoking, and\nconstantly being reinvented; the\nGuardian says \u201cit is impossible to\nimagine [\u2026] the entire musical world\nwithout Pierre Boulez\u201d. But then why\nhaven\u2019t you heard of him? And, at the\nrecent 90th\nbirthday celebrations at\nthe Barbican, why was the hall half\nempty?\nThe masterpieces of Mozart were\nwritten at a time when men wore\npowdered wigs and aristocrats\ndeclared that \u201cTo write poetry after\nAuschwitz is barbaric\u201d. Whether\nyou agree or not, it is clear that art\ncould not continue as before and\nignore the new reality. In the 20th\nCentury an unprecedented diversity\nof musical thought emerged, ranging\nfrom the reactionary and easygoing minimalists to the strictures\nof serialism. Boulez, at least at the\nstart of his career, was a certified\nserialist. Serialism was a method,\ndeveloped by Arnold Schoenberg in\nthe 1920s, which attempted to free\nmusic from the \u201ctyranny\u201d of the tonal\ncentre, allowing the other musical\nparameters, such as rhythm and\ntimbre to take centre-stage.\nAfter the war, Boulez and others\nwould extend this beyond tone to\nall the parameters of sound, a style\nknown as total serialism. This rigid,\nhighly formulised way of writing\nmusic was attacked for its asceticism,\nfor its artifice and sterility, and\nfor its lack of expression. Boulez\nhimself realised these limits, but his\nlater music retains certain aspects,\nincluding a focus on architecture and\nstructure rather than expression or\nsensuality. This certainly sets him\napart from past French composers,\nsuch as Debussy or Ravel, but then\nagain Boulez was working in a new\nworld. His musical mission seems\naltogether higher, and in his own\nwords was nothing less than the\nconstruction of a new \u2018musical\nlanguage\u2019.\n\u201cIf you want a kind of supermarket\naesthetic, OK, do that, nobody will be\nagainst it, but everybody will eventually\nforget it\u201d\nHis first great success was \u2018Le\nmarteau sans maitre\u2019, or, \u2018The\nhammer without a master\u2019, first\nperformed in 1955. The orchestration\nwas new and cosmopolitan \u2013\ncombining instruments from all\nover the world into groups and\nallowing an abstraction of timbre\nfrom instrumental identities.\nAlthough it is set to surrealist\npoetry, the music is structured at\neven the smallest scale according to\ntechniques derived from serialism\nsuch as pitch multiplication. In the\ndecades since, Boulez has published\nfewer than 20 works, but each are,\nin the words of George Benjamin,\n\u201csingular statements, singular and\nunique works\u201d, something unique\nand I think entirely appropriate for\nour cultural milieu. Also unique is the\nmanner in which Boulez continually\nrevises his work and perfects them\nfurther, as if reaching closer to some\nideal expression of the piece\u2019s logic.\nIn these later works he experiments\nwith the use of chance to determine\nstructure (\u2018Pli selon pli\u2019), spatial\norganisation of sound (\u2018Rituel in\nmemoriam Bruno Maderna\u2019) and the\nuse of electronics (such as in \u2018Repons\u2019).\nIt was in 1970 that then-president\nGeorges Pompidou invited Boulez to\nbuild an institute for musical research\nPierre Boulez as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Photo: BBC Radio 3\n\"In 1971 he\nadvocated\nfor the\ndestruction\nof the\nMona Lisa.\"\n\"It is\nimpossible\nto imagine\nthe entire\nmusical\nworld\nwithout\nPierre\nBoulez.\"\nentertained themselves at balls in\nornate palaces; the Enlightenment\nideals of rationality and form were\nmanifest. When Beethoven wrote his\ndramatic symphonies, full of angst\nand triumph, society was turning\ninward and Napoleon\u2019s conquests\ninspired the ideas of great men. The\n20th\nCentury began with two wars\nof unprecedented scale. Industrial\ntechnology enabled the destruction\nof a generation, and entire peoples,\nwhile in peacetime dehumanised the\nlower classes and manufactured a\ncommodified culture for the masses.\nAt least, this is the pessimistic view\nof social theorists such as Theodor\nAdorno, who, in 1949, famously\n\n"

The inquest ruled\nthat Grimm had taken his own life by\nasphyxiating himself.\nOn April 7th\nThe West London\nCoroner\u2019s Court also heard the report\nfrom Imperial\u2019s internal review of\nstaff policies in response to Grimm\u2019s\ndeath, which featured recommended\nchanges, including increasing support\nfor struggling staff members.\nThe senior coroner, Chinyere\nInyama, noted how the funding issues\nwere clearly mounting stress on the\nprofessor, and cited Grimm\u2019s death as\n\u201cneedless.\u201d\nHowever, Imperial\u2019s own director\nof Human Resources, Louise Lindsay,\nwho led the internal review, admitted\nat the inquest that the changes still\nmight not have prevented Grimm\u2019s\nsuicide.\nAn Imperial spokesperson has\nsince told Felix that \u201cGiven the\ncomplex nature of suicide, it would be\nimpossible to answer with certainty\nwhether any action taken by the\nCollege could have resulted in a\ndifferent outcome.\u201d\nThe internal review has also been\nheavily criticised online by other\nacademics based at Oxford University\nand University College London.\nGrimm\u2019s death hit national\nheadlines last October after a\nposthumous email sent in his name\naccused Imperial of mistreatment of\nstaff and stated that: \u201cThis is not a\nuniversity anymore but a business.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cWhat these guys\ndon\u2019t know is that they destroy lives.\nWell, they certainly destroyed mine.\u201d\nIn his email, time stamped as sent\nafter his death, Grimm explained how\nhe had received an \u201cultimatum email\u201d\nfrom Professor Martin Wilkins, his\nline manager, in March of last year,\ndetailing how Grimm was being\nplaced under informal review.\nWilkins explained that although\nhe was aware of Grimm\u2019s dedication\nto try and find funding, he was still\n\u201cstruggling to fulfil the metrics of a\nProfessorial post at Imperial College.\u201d\nWilkins then stated that should\nGrimm fail to secure a \u00a3200,000\nprogramme grant in the next\ntwelve months, he would have to\nconsider taking further, formal\naction in accordance to the College\u2019s\ncurrent policies for managing poor\nperformance.\nThe internal review conducted\nby Imperial outlined how Grimm\nwas actually under what is known\ninformal review for nearly two years\nbut no further formal action was\ntaken in relation to his progress.\nThe review stated that: \u201cthe formal\nstages would have provided more\nclarity to Professor Grimm on process\nand support through the written\ndocumentation, representation at\nmeetings and HR involvement.\u201d\nHowever, other staff that had been\nthrough performance management\n(similar to that undergone by Grimm)\nalso contacted the reviewers, with\nit being noted in that: \u201cthere were\na number of cases where staff did\nnot feel that they had received the\nsupport that they needed.\u201d\nThe review also addressed the\ntraining of management staff, the\ntimescale and progression of informal\nand formal review processes, and\nthe resources available from HR for\ndisciplinary procedures.\nThe recommendations included\nintroducing performance and\ndisciplinary training to managers and\nrequesting that managers notify the\nHuman Resources department before\nputting employers under informal\nreview.\nThe review also suggested that\ntemplate emails and letters should\nbe created for correspondence\nconcerning performance\nmanagement, and that HR also\nreviews all correspondence before\nbeing sent.\nThe report concluded with\nrecommendations for improvements\nthat were presented to the provost\nboard on the 27th\nFebruary. The\nrecommendations were accepted.\nThe review was completed by\nLindsey and the Senior Consul,\nProfessor Richard Thompson,\nand was sent by James Stirling, the\nProvost of the College, to all heads\nof department. He has since received\nfurther feedback, that he said in an\nall staff email sent on Tuesday that\nthey will be taking on board when\nimplementing the recommendations.\nHowever, some academics\nhave criticised the suggested\nimprovements, stating that they\nsimply add more bureaucracy, or are\nunlikely to make a difference.\nIn a letter posted on the Times\nHigher Education website, Dorothy\nBishop, a professor of developmental\nneuropsychology at the University\nof Oxford, stated that targets in\nacademia related to performance and\nachieving grant need to be abolished.\nBishop said in the letter: \u201cI am\ndistressed to find that Imperial just\ndoesn\u2019t get it, and seems to think that\nit can avoid future tragedies by just\n\u201cmanaging\u201d people and \u201csupporting\u201d\nthem in dealing with the crazy targets\nthat they are confronted with.\u201d\nDavid Colquhoun, a professor\nof pharmacology from University\nCollege London, criticised the new\nrecommendations as being steeped\nin bureaucracy, and stated the\nsuggestions would simply act as a\n\u201cSmokescreen for carrying on as at\npresent.\u201d\nHe also said when Grimm\u2019s email\nfirst surfaced, that \u201cIt just seems\nImperial are doing their best to\nwhitewash it. They rarely get to the\nheart of the matter.\u201d\nGrimm was working on developing\ntreatments for cancer, and he had\nalready published four papers in that\nyear based on his research.\nThe Reporter, Imperial\u2019s own\nin-house staff newsletter, published\nan obituary for Grimm, five months\nafter his death.\nWritten by colleagues from his\nApoptosis research group, they\ndescribed Grimm as a \u201cterrific\nmentor, deeply committed to all the\nprojects running in his lab\u2026 he was a\nvery gentle and caring person, a man\nof his word, working tirelessly for his\nstudents and postdoctoral scientists.\n\u201cStefan will be greatly missed by\nhis current and former lab partners,\ncolleagues and collaborators around\nthe world.\u201d\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\n"

That\nsimple little search linked me up\nwith Familia Espino in the heart\nof Colchagua Valley, the nation\u2019s\nfamed wine region that\u2019s rapidly\ngaining traction on both the gringo\ntrail and luxury travel market, while\nstill retaining the charm of a place\nwell within its prime. In the run-up to\nmy stay, I\u2019d partied my way through\nRio Carnival, CouchSurfed with\nsome crazies across Argentina, and\nburnt what remained of my energy\nand sanity at Lollapalooza Festival \u2013\ndecompression was long overdue.\nThe job appealed to me because I\nwanted a combination of vineyard\nwork and care work, which is exactly\nwhat the job delivered. The family\nhome is on the fringe of Marchigue, a\nbeautiful town set against a backdrop\nof picturesque mountaintops and\nendless vineyards, and the home itself\ncomes equipped with a well-groomed\nCarmanere vineyard at its rear. Any\nwork on the vineyard will of course\nvary depending on the time of year,\nculminating in the late April harvest,\nat which point grapes are shipped\noff for processing and bottling.\nFollowing an unfortunate accident\nthe family\u2019s son Mario now relies on a\nwheelchair for much of his mobility:\nhe receives around-the-clock care and\nsessions with medical professionals,\nso the role is predominately social,\nwith as many elements of physiothe\nrapy as you\u2019re willing to engage with.\nI spent a month with Familia\nEspino and had a fantastic time. In\naddition to my work on the vineyard\nand with Mario, my stay coincided\nwith the area\u2019s largest wine harvest\nfestival, an excellent weekend of\noutstanding food and wonderful\nwines. The house is also a short bus\nride from capital Santiago, so it\u2019s\nperfectly doable to spend a couple\nof weekends away partying with\nwhoever you happen to have met\non your travels. And for the wave\nworshippers among you, Chilean surf\nhaven Pichilemu is just a short drive\naway: the family have a car you can\nborrow (a UK license will suffice) and\nfriends that can hook you up with\nequipment. Oh, and the local produce\nmarkets make Borough Market look\nlike Morrisons markdowns.\nI\u2019d say I picked up a lot more than\nwhat I\u2019d initially expected from the\njob description: on top of learning\na thing or two about wine and\nfinding new friends in my hosts, I\nwas continuously kept on my toes at\nmealtimes, due to the rapid pace of\nChilean Spanish and varied topics of\nconversation.\nOn that note, I\u2019d say this\nWorkAway is a particularly good\ncall for anyone wanting longer-term\nexperience with a single patient,\nthose applying for graduate-entry\nmedicine, or someone simply looking\nfor a slight change of pace and\ndecompression from big city life. For\nme the experience was a wonderful\nWorkAway debut that I\u2019d love to\nreplicate and would recommend to\nanyone.\n\"A\nwonderful\nWorkAway\ndebut that\nI\u2019d love to\nreplicate\nand would\nrecommend\nto anyone\"\nPhoto: Emiliana\n\n"

    "content": "32 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n01.05.2015\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park and Jack Steadman\nIt\u2019s time for the final entry in Marvel\u2019s \u2018Phase\nTwo\u2019, as the Avengers come together once more\nto face their greatest foe\nThe Age of Ultron is upon us\nThere\u2019s a lot to be said about\nsequels and their relationships\nto their predecessors, and it\u2019s\nalmost all been said before. So with\nthe usual preamble resoundingly\nskipped, the heart of the matter is\nthis: Age of Ultron very much shares\nthe traditional trait of being a \u2018darker\u2019\nsequel. It sheds the bombast and\nexcitement of the first Avengers\nfilm for something more intense,\nmore personal, and ultimately more\nfulfilling.\nThe first film was very slow-burn,\ntaking its time to piece the team\ntogether \u2013 often by pitting the\nvarious Avengers against each other\nfirst \u2013 before everything comes\ntogether in a triumphant climactic\nbattle in the middle of New York.\nAge of Ultron gets all of that\nbusiness out of the way immediately,\nopening in medias res with the\nAvengers\u2019 assault on Baron von\nStrucker\u2019s mountainous fortress (last\nseen in the post-credits stinger for The\nWinter Soldier).\nWithin the first few minutes,\nthere\u2019s a new twist on that shot from\nthe last film, as well as a chance to\nsee all of the Avengers in action\n\u2013 including the new additions to\nthe equation, Quicksilver (Aaron\nTaylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch\n(Elisabeth Olsen), although they\u2019re\nnot called that here. Not yet. This\nearly on, they\u2019re still Pietr and\nWanda Maximoff \u2013 and they\u2019re on\nthe opposite side to the Avengers.\nAny fears that this version of\nQuicksilver wouldn\u2019t match up to the\none seen in last year\u2019s X-Men: Days of\nFuture Past can be laid to rest; while he\ndoesn\u2019t quite have any one moment\nthat matches up to his X-Men\nPhoto: Joss Whedon/Disney\nAven\nRe-A\n\"Age of\nUltron\nis very\nmuch a\ntraditional\n\u2018darker\u2019\nsequel.\"\n\"Ultron is a\nfascinating\nvillian [but]\nhe feels\nweirdly\nunder-used.\"\ncounterpart\u2019s starring moment, this\nQuicksilver has a more prolonged role\nin the storyline to compensate.\nNaturally this first battle is won\nby the Avengers \u2013 although the\nMaximoffs are still at large \u2013 and it\nappears that Hydra may have finally\nbeen put to rest, and the team can\nrelax in style.\nAt the party, Whedon\u2019s typical\nquick-witted interplay comes to the\nfore, providing a stream of laughs\nwhile also showing that these are\nall characters he understands. A\ncontest to try and lift Thor\u2019s hammer\nquickly lays out the traits of the group\nalongside a healthy dose of comedy.\nAnd then Ultron (played\nmagnificently by James Spader)\narrives to ruin it all.\nUltron is a fascinating villain.\nDespite the film\u2019s hefty running time,\nand his presence in most of it, he still\nfeels weirdly under-used.\nCreated by Tony Stark (Robert\nDowney, Jr.) in an attempt to craft\na global peace-keeping program, he\ndefinitely has some daddy issues\nalongside his need to see the human\nrace driven to extinction for its own\ngood.\nHis reasoning behind this \u2013 and\ntherefore his entire motivation for\ndoing anything in the film \u2013 doesn\u2019t\nfeel as fully explored or fleshed out\nas it could be. It just sort of \u2018is.\u2019 It\u2019s\nacknowledged a lot, but not really\ndiscussed.\nThe daddy issues only really get one\nmoment of being dealt with \u2013 and it\u2019s\na glorious one that reveals volumes\nabout Ultron as a character, which is\nwhy it\u2019s a shame there aren\u2019t more of\nthem.\nBut there\u2019s always an underlying\ntension to the whole thing, with\nUltron very much being his father\u2019s\ncreation: even his speech rhythms\nsubconsciously echo Stark\u2019s, making\nfor some entertaining subversion of\nstandard villain tropes.\nBut while the father-son dynamic\nof Stark and Ultron doesn\u2019t fully get\nits due, the relationships between\nother characters are almost all given\na chance to shine. Vision in particular\ngets his own father-son storyline with\nUltron \u2013 one which has a great deal\nmore resolution than Ultron and\nStark\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s one that lands with\ngenuine meaning.\nMore generally, where Avengers had\nto do a lot of leg work in just getting\neveryone together, Age of Ultron\nstarts off with pretty much everyone\ninvolved (at least early on) being a\nknown quantity.\nWith that, it has plenty of room to\ngo off and explore the bonds between\ncharacters, and toy with just how they\nbounce off one another.\nThe connection between Black\nWidow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce\nBanner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)\nseems to have only grown since the\nfirst film \u2013 not something anyone\nreally seems to have seen coming\n\u2013 while the ideological conflicts\nbetween Captain America (Chris\nEvans) and Iron Man start to simmer\nnicely before Civil War.\nAge of Ultron is a hugely character-driven piece, much more so than\nits predecessor (and arguably the\nother Marvel films). It\u2019s to Whedon\u2019s\nenormous credit that it never loses\nany entertainment value for that, and\nit feels like a much richer film for it.\nAvengers occasionally stumbled\nin its handling of characters, often\nfeeling like the Tony Stark Show, to\nthe detriment of smaller characters\nlike Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), which\nis probably why it\u2019s such a joy here\nthat Hawkeye is the absolute heart of\nAge of Ultron.\nIt\u2019s hard to put into words just how\nmuch Hawkeye matters to this film.\nAlmost all of the humanity either\ncomes from or is directly related to\nhim, and it gives the film the vast\nmajority of its emotional beats.\nDiscussions on how mere mortals\nlike Hawkeye are working alongside\nthese gods (literally, in one case)\nto become something genuinely\nheroic, simply because it\u2019s their day\njob. Inspiring speeches on duty and\nsacrifice. Musings on family, and\nwhat being an Avenger means for\nthat. It all stems from Hawkeye. And\nit is wonderful.\nThe only thing that stops him from\nstealing the entire show is The Vision\n(Paul Bettany). The Vision is an\nabsolute picture \u2013 he looks deliriously\nweird, and it feels like he marks the\npoint where the Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse finally tips over into the\nkooky, magical space drama side of\nthings.\nGuardians of the Galaxy was the first\nfilm to really embrace that non-Earth-bound side of the universe,\nand it was a resounding success, so\nit\u2019s not exactly an original claim,\nbut the arrival of Vision heralds the\ndawn of Phase 3. You can feel the\nshift happening around him, as the\ndark, broody Phase 2 gives way to the\ngloriously insane, enormous in scale\nPhase 3.\nThe film embraces Vision\u2019s\nweirdness with outright glee, and\nhe\u2019s easily the best addition to the\nfranchise from this film.\nThat shift between MCU\nPhases doesn\u2019t come without its\nsimultaneous upsides and downsides,\nhowever.\nThere are multiple references to\nfuture storylines that feel more than a\nlittle shoe-horned in: Thor\u2019s side-plot\nJACK STEADMAN\nSECTION EDITOR\nAVENGERS: AGE OF\nULTRON\nDirector: Joss Whedon\nScreenplay: Joss Whedon\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris\nEvans, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett\nJohansson, Mark Ruffalo\n\n"

Throw in a few jokes\nabout Gypsies, the inconstancy of\nwomen, and old men falling into\nplates of spaghetti and it turns into an\nunpalatable cocktail of racism, sexism\nand slapstick comedy.\nOf course, there is a but. Somehow,\nthis Rossini opera wasn\u2019t an operatic\nversion of the Daily Mail. Somehow,\nit managed to re-stage 200 year old\njokes and make them genuinely\nfunny for a modern audience. Not\nfake, high-brow, isn\u2019t-this-culturallyenriching type funny \u2013 but pure,\nreal laugh-out-loud funny. For\na repertoire opera that is a real\nachievement.\nIl Turco in Italia centres around a\nlove triangle that turns into a love\npentagon as the story evolves. A\nhandsome Turkish prince, Salim,\nvisits Italy on holiday and catches\nthe eye of a local beauty, Fiorella. He\nthinks she\u2019s majorly hot stuff, and\nthey hit it off. Obviously Fiorella is\nmarried to a na\u00efve sugar-daddy style\nhusband who\u2019s not too happy about\nit all. He teams up with Fiorella\u2019s\nElvis-esque ex-lover (complete with\nyellow bomber jacket and turquoise\nVespa) to stop the \u201cTurk\u201d getting too\ncosy with their girl. Conveniently,\nSelim\u2019s spurned former-fianc\u00e9, now\ntravelling around with a band of\ngypsies, is also on hand to add to the\nfarcical love tangle.\nOvershadowed by Rossini\u2019s most\nfamous comic opera, The Barber of\nSeville, this performance rarely gets\nput on, and the Royal Opera House\u2019s\nproduction (which premiered in\n2005) is an exception. Its success lies\nin adding an extra layer of comedy\nto the opera. Originally aimed at\n18th\ncentury Italians, the libretto is\npeppered with nationalistic speeches\nand jokes at the expense of women,\nforeigners, and Travellers. By staging\nthe piece in a stylised 60s Italy, the\nproduction allows the audience to\nlaugh at a stereotypical image of\nItaly, and thus makes the other jokes\nok too. Suddenly having a giggle\nabout the sexual benefits of harems\nor the stealing habits of gypsies is\nfine, because after all you\u2019ve just\nhad a laugh about a giant pizza, an\noverdressed Italian dandy, and an\nold man sparring with a forkful of\nspaghetti (this actually happened. An\nextra reason to get yourself a ticket\nfor this!). It\u2019s simple but it\u2019s genius,\na revelation for the many musically\nbeautiful but non-PC operas which\nfill theatres every year. The usual\ntactic is to tone down the insalubrious\njokes at the expense of the public\u2019s\nentertainment (The Royal Opera\nHouse\u2019s Magic Flute, from earlier\nthis season, is an example in kind),\ncontributing to the perception that\nopera is for boring old farts.\nPatrice Courier and Moshe Leiser\u2019s\nclever directing is supported by a\nfantastic cast, who don\u2019t seem to be\ntoo dignified to be comic actors as\nwell as world-class opera singers. The\nleads are all incredibly real, believable\npeople, achieving comedy while\nescaping the one-dimensionality\nwhich often tarnishes farcical theatre.\nFiorella (Alekzandra Kurzac) and\nSelim (Ildebrando D\u2019Arcangelo) are\nalso a beautiful soprano and bass\nrespectively, and make a musically\nbalanced pair. The staging is so\ncolourful and sunny that you\u2019ll\nalmost get a suntan by sitting in your\nseat \u2013 think pink beach umbrellas,\npalm trees and stylised landscapes in\nbright, bold colours.\nThis is real comic opera, an \u2018opera\nbuffa\u2019 as it was originally conceived.\nThe set is minimal and modern, the\ndirectors\u2019 have taken some liberty\nwith the jokes, and the costumes\naren\u2019t a faithful reproduction of the\nhistorical style. But the audience\u2019s\nlaughter rang out throughout as it\nwould have on its first night, in 1814.\nSo three cheers for the Royal Opera\nHouse, and down with the boring old\nfarts.\nAny hope that the National\nTheatre\u2019s Rules For Living\nwould be a quiet affair was\nquickly dashed upon reading the\nprogramme: tucked in the cast list is\nan acknowledgement for Kate Waters\n\u2013 Fight Director. This gives us a clear\nindication of the direction the play\nis going to go in, but really it should\nbe obvious from the start - Rules\nFor Living centres around that most\nvolatile of environments: the middle-class Christmas dinner.\nDirector Marianne Elliott takes\nSam Holcroft\u2019s explosive script, and\ntransposes the action to the NT\u2019s\nDorfman Theatre, whose seats rise up\nlike bleachers at a high school grudge\nmatch, a comparison that is only\nmade stronger by Chloe Lamford\u2019s\nset design. Lines mark out different\nterritories, there are zones like\n\u2018Home\u2019 and \u2018Garden\u2019, and at the end\nconfetti crowns the \u2018winner\u2019; but the\nmost unique and intrusive aspects of\nthe design are the large scoreboards\nthat flank the ends of the stage, upon\nwhich the different family members\u2019\nvarious \u2018rules for living\u2019 flash up.\nThus insecure Adam (Steven Mangan)\naffects an accent to mock, uptight\nSheena (Claudie Blakley) must resort\nto alcohol whenever she wants to\ncontradict, and the matriarch of the\nclan (Deborah Findlay) calms her\nnerves by scrubbing every surface\nin sight. The result is a snappy play\nthat positively crackles with energy,\nalthough the format on occasion\nlimits the plot progression.\nOne of the major themes of the\nplay is CBT, or Cognitive Behaviour\nTherapy, a form of psychotherapy in\nwhich the root cause of anxiety and\ndepression is sought out, and action\ntaken to prevent future occurrences.\nIt seems to me that many\nscriptwriters could do with some form\nof therapy, particularly those whose\nwork involves a family at Christmas\ntime - there is rarely a happy ending,\nand Rules for Living is no exception,\nwith resentment turning into grudges\nturning into outright warfare. Adam,\nwhose dreams of being a cricket\nstar have been crushed thanks to a\nRichie-Tenenbaum-Style meltdown\nat Lord\u2019s, is now stuck in a boring\njob as a solicitor; he\u2019s been eclipsed\nby his brother Matthew (Miles Jupp),\nwho instead was forced into legal\nwork, thanks to his overbearing judge\nof a father (John Rogan). Matthew\nhas rebelled \u2013 as best he can \u2013 by\nbecoming involved with Carrie\n(Maggie Service), a bubbly comedic\nactor, trying to make it big in the\nworld of drama.\nAlthough such characters may, on\npaper, sound like a mere collection of\nstereotypes, the way the cast handles\nthe roles really brings them to life,\nnot least Deborah Findlay, whose\nEdith is imbued with a duality of\nmaternal love and simmering rage.\nClaudie Blakely is also great in the\nrole of Sheena, trying to hold her\nmarriage together in the face of\nmounting apathy from her husband\nFRED FYLES\nSECTION EDITOR\nover their daughter\u2019s depression,\nfor which she is going to receive \u2013\nsurprise, surprise \u2013 CBT. At moments\nlike this, where serendipity tips over\ninto heavy-handedness, the script can\nfeel somewhat sluggish, almost as if\nthe audience is being spoken down to.\nThe use of rules is a mixed blessing.\nOn the one hand, it serves as a witty\npiece of stagecraft, giving us a clever\ninsight into the characters\u2019 inner\nlives; thus we experience a delicious\nburst of dramatic irony when\nMatthew, who must sit down to tell a\nlie, pulls up a chair to tell Sheena how\ntasty her gluten-free, dairy-free, joy-free mince pies are, and also a pang\nof sadness when he remains seated\nto tell Carrie how much he loves her.\nElsewhere, however, it falls somewhat\nflat, like for Carrie, whose rule \u2013 she\nmust stand up to tell a joke \u2013 means\nthat she is forced to bounce around\nthe stage like an overexcited rabbit;\nsometimes this works, but other times\nit simply adds in another unnecessary\nelement. The most intrusive rule is\nundoubtedly Adam\u2019s, which leads\nto an extraordinary range of accents\nfrom Magnan, robbing from the\naudience any sympathy that we may\nhave had for him.\nAs the play progresses, the rules\nbegin to get more and more complex,\npiling up like a series of obstacles.\nFor the most part, this works, but\nthere are occasions where the script\nfeels like a slave to the rules, rather\nthan the master. Thankfully the\nteam manage to hold their own,\nwith standout performances from\nFindlay and Blakely. Two final things\nto add: firstly, how refreshing it is\nto see a play written, directed, and\ndesigned by women \u2013 this is the last\nproduction at the National Theatre\nunder Nicholas Hytner, and I can\nonly hope that such things continue\nwith his successor. Secondly, the play\nculminates in a massive food-fight,\nwith a mashed-potato-as-pathos\nmania as Christmas dinner is\ndecimated; unfortunately not all the\ncast have a great aim - if you\u2019re sitting\nin the front rows, I would recommend\nbringing a raincoat.\n\n"

Photo: Crea\nJoshua Renken recaps the televised\nelection debate, and gives the lowdown\non how each candidate held their own\nThe big Debate between\nthe biggest names in\npolitics\nThe first and only televised\nelection debate for this year\u2019s\ngeneral election took place\nearlier this month, featuring seven\nparty leaders from across the United\nKingdom. The two-hour debate was\nstructured around four key questions\non the following topics: tackling\nthe deficit, the future of the NHS,\nimmigration policy and future\nprospects for young people.\nThe marathon debate, moderated\nby Julie Etchingham and hosted by\nitv, represented months of foreplay\nbetween political operators and\nbroadcasters culminating in a single\npre-election debate featuring seven\nparty leaders from across the political\nspectrum.\nThe meeting was enlivened by the\nnew female dynamic and stirred by\nthe presence of three parties that\nonly stand in certain areas of the UK:\nthe SNP in Scotland, Plaid Cymru\nin Wales and The Green Party in\nEngland and Wales. So how well did\neach candidate perform?\nDavid CameronConservatives\nCameron took the opportunity to\nreemphasise that five years ago the\ncountry was \u201con the brink\u201d and that\nthe \u201clong term economic plan was\nworking.\u201d He spoke of two million\nmore jobs and the coalition tax cuts.\nCameron defended attacks on his\nimmigration record by stressing\nthat the UK currently has the fastest\ngrowing economy in any major\nwestern country, naturally resulting\nin people wanting to come here. He\npredictably focused his attacks on\nLabour, and expressed concern that\nvoting for Miliband would \u201cput us\nback to square one.\u201d The PM declared\nthat the problem with Miliband is\nthat he \u201cstill doesn\u2019t think Labour\nborrowed and spent too much,\u201d and\ntold the audience about a letter left\nby Labour at the Treasury in 2010\nwhich read \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ve ran out\nof money.\u201d\nThe Conservative leader came\nout strong for the NHS, calling\nit the UK\u2019s \u201cmost important\nnational institution\u201d that provided\n\u201cunbelievable care\u201d for his severely\ndisabled son. Cameron claimed that\nthere are now 9000 more doctors\nand 20000 fewer bureaucrats, and\npromised to implement seven-day\noperation for A&E and GP surgeries.\nIn response to attacks from Ed\nMiliband on the number of zero hour\ncontracts, Cameron told the audience\nabout claims that 70 labour MPs\ncurrently employ people on zero hour\ncontracts.\nOn immigration, Cameron laid\nout plans for new policies that would\nstop immigrants from claiming\nbenefits until they have lived and\npaid into the country for four years\nand prevent migrant workers from\nsending money to dependents who\nlive overseas. The PM promised an\nin-out referendum on Europe in 2017\nafter renegotiations to \u201cget a better\ndeal for Britain.\u201d\nEd Miliband - Labour\nEd Miliband focused his attacks on\nCameron\u2019s record, claiming that \u201cover\nthe last five years wages haven\u2019t kept\nup with bills.\u201d\nHe promised to raise the minimum\nwage to \u00a38 an hour and \u201crescue the\nNHS by hiring more doctors and\nnurses.\u201d Labour\u2019s cut in tuition fees\nfrom six to nine thousand was not\ncriticised by the other leaders, while\nMiliband promised to cut the deficit\nevery year while reversing the tax\ncut for millionaires and making\n\u201ccommon sense spending reductions,\nwhere outside the NHS and education\nsystem spending will fall.\u201d\nThe Labour leader set out a NHS\n\u201ctime to care fund\u201d coming from a\nnew mansion tax on properties worth\nover \u00a32 million, a banker\u2019s bonus\ntax and unexplained money coming\nfrom tobacco companies. The Labour\nleader attacked Cameron on the\nNHS, claiming that \u201cover one million\npeople waited in A&E for more than\nfour hours.\u201d\nMiliband plans to prevent\nimmigrations from receiving benefits\nfor the first two years that they come\nhere, and will attempt to \u201cstop the\nundercutting of wages and working\nconditions.\u201d On the EU, Miliband\nargued that \u201cDavid Cameron has\nmarginalised us in Europe\u201d and\nasserted that he will not be holding a\nreferendum like the Tories.\nIn his closing speech, Miliband\nreminded the audience that he will\n\u201cstand up to energy companies\u201d and\nimplement a price freeze.\nNick Clegg \u2013 Liberal\nDemocrats\nThe abiding message from Nick\nClegg was that the Liberal Democrats\nact as a moderating force in British\npolitics, who will stop the country\nfrom \u201clurching to the left or\nright.\u201d The deputy prime minister\nacknowledged that \u201cno one is going to\nwin outright in this election,\u201d but that\n\u201cthe country is in a much better shape\nthan it was five years ago.\u201d\nMr Clegg declared that the\nLiberal Democrats have \u201cthe grit\nand resilience to finish the job and\nbalance the books fairly\u201d and did a\ngood job of positioning himself as\nthe reasonable compromise between\nthe two biggest parties. The Lib Dem\nleader went on to say that the next\nfive years require more austerity but\nemphasised that \u201cIt\u2019s a balance. We\nwill cut less than tory, and borrow less\nthan labour.\u201d\nIn an effort to distance himself\nfrom his Coalition partner, Nick\nClegg attacked Mr Cameron on the\nharsh cuts made in the coalition,\nclaiming that the prime minister\nhad executed \u201cideologically driven\ncuts on schools\u201d and that the \u201cTories\ncut more because they want to,\u201d\nas opposed to the Lib Dem who\nreluctantly feel that it is in the best\ninterests of the country\u2019s current\nfinances.\n\u201cThe NHS doesn\u2019t need warm\nwords it needs hard cash.\u201d Mr Clegg\nalso stated that \u201cmental health has for\nfar too long been the poor cousin of\nphysical health.\u201d\nThe deputy prime minister said\nhe \u201cwill never spread fear about\nimmigration\u201d and \u201cwelcome people\nwho play by the rules,\u201d before going\non to say that \u201cwithout immigrants\nthe NHS would collapse overnight.\u201d\nThe three female leaders shared\nthese positive sentiments towards\nimmigrants.\nIn one exchange between the\nthree biggest Westminster parties,\nMr Clegg asked Ed Miliband for\nan apology about the state of the\neconomy that the coalition inherited.\nThis prompted a rare applause from\nthe audience. Miliband deflected the\ncriticism by attacking Cameron for\nhis statements while in opposition\nthat the banks were overregulated\nbefore the 2008 crisis, \u201cso I won\u2019t take\nany lectures from you.\u201d\nMr Clegg defended his party\u2019s\nsuccess in the coalition with the\npupil premium, income tax cuts\nfor millions of low earners and new\napprenticeships, before talking about\nthe Liberal Democrat \u2018rent-to-own\u2019\nscheme for people trying to get onto\nthe property ladder.\nThe deputy prime minister intends\nto raise more money by closing reliefs\nin capital gains tax. He closed his\nspeech by highlighting the Liberal\nDemocrat mission statement: \u201cA\nstronger economy and a fairer\nsociety, with opportunity for all.\u201d\nNicola Sturgeon \u2013 SNP\nNicola Sturgeon said she was\ncommitted to changing the\nWestminster system while \u201cstanding\nup for Scotland\u2019s best interests.\u201d\nShe made it clear that she wants\nScottish independence and offered\nan alternative to austerity, where the\nUK \u201cputs investment in children, not\nnuclear weapons.\u201d The SNP leader\nclaimed that \u201ceconomic policies\nshouldn\u2019t be and end in itself,\u201d and\nwould like to see \u201cmodest spending\nincreases\u201d that stop \u201cpushing people\ninto poverty.\u201d While admitting that\nthis approach would \u201ctake longer to\npay off the debt,\u201d Nicola Sturgeon\njustified that it would \u201cgive money for\ninfrastructure and public services.\u201d\nShe criticised the coalition\u2019s \u201cblind\ncommitment to austerity,\u201d insisted\nthat \u201cyou can\u2019t cut your way out of the\ndeficit\u201d and won over the audience\nafter observing \u201cit seems that there\nis nothing Nigel Farage won\u2019t blame\non foreigners.\u201d After calling the NHS\n\u201ctoo precious for private profit,\u201d\nNicola Sturgeon reemphasised lifting\npeople out of poverty and scrapping\ntrident, while creating an \u201ceducation\nsystem based on the ability to learn\nnot the ability to pay.\u201d\nNigel Farage \u2013 UKIP\nNigel Farage quickly tried to distance\nhimself from the other leaders,\nexplaining that \u201call the other six\n\n"

Aidan Turner preparing for one of the show\u2019s most famous scenes. Photo:\nBBC\nGiulia Gabrielli looks at the Nation\u2019s new addiction to Poldark.\nBeautiful beaches of Britain\nLook behind the well-sculpted muscles of Ross Poldark\nand you\u2019ll see the Cornish coastline.This is not the first\ntime that a British beach has proven to be a co-star on\na TV show.I guess when you can\u2019t boast the sun and\nthe white sands,and when\u201cit\u2019s so bracing\u201d(read\u201ccold\nand miserable\u201d) becomes your catch phrase,a little bit\nof publicity is always welcome.A similar fame to that\nthat will inevitably be encountered by the beaches of\nPoldark has already been experienced by the Dorset\ncoast where the TV drama Broadchurch was set.The\nshow was a police drama so dark and disturbing it is a\nsurprise that people could watch it and think of their\nnext holiday location.However,the brilliant writing and\nacting by David Tennant (DrWho) and Olivia Coleman\n(every other TV/movie show ever) wasn\u2019t the only thing\nviewers appreciated,at least in the first season,before\nshares dropped dramatically.Currently property prices\nare on the rise in the area and local businesses are\nsmacking their lips in delight.Even less subtle was the\nattempt of 2012\u2019s series TrueLove to publicise the holiday\ntown of Margate,Kent.The narrative,also featuring\nDavid Tennant,was relatively poor,focusing individual\nepisodes on different inhabitants of the small town,\nall linked to each other.The hype was maintained by\npromises of lesbian kisses with Billie Piper and,of\ncourse,epic coastal panoramas.I guess these shows\nserve as reminders of what television\u2019s prime purpose\nis: a broadcast for all things new and beautiful.A cynic\nmay interpret this as an attempt to bring people to\nsmall,rapidly deflating towns.However,I like to think of\nit as more of an educational journey to discover all this\nlovely country has to offer,which is so much more than\nthe view from Waterloo Bridge.Thus reconfirming the\nBBC\u2019s mission\u201cto inform,educate and entertain\u201d.\nGIULIA GABRIELLI\n\"Turner\nlanded a\nrole that\ncould haunt\nhim, worst,\ntypecast\nhim,\nforever.\"\nIrarely write an article about a\nprogramme and focus so much\ninterest on its main character.\nOf course there are heartthrobs who\nkeep you glued to the screen, but Ross\nPoldark is different. The reason why\nhe is different, is that rarely such a\nhype has been built around a single\ncharacter, to the detriment of an\notherwise rather empty show.\nThe story of the nation\u2019s obsession\nwith the Cornish hunk started in\n1975, when the BBC began airing the\nseries Poldark starring Robin Ellis. I\nguess as often happens, it probably\nstarted earlier with the Winston\nGraham books being published in\n1940s and 50s, but those were darker\ntimes, without any pictures.\nLooking at Robin Ellis now it\u2019s\nhard to understand what of his weird\n1970\u2019s looks, hairdo and all, was so\nappealing to the ladies. However, this\ngentleman has forever been cursed\nwith having played the dark Cornish\ngentleman.\nNow a similar curse could fall on\nthe shoulders of actor Aidan Turner.\nAfter portraying Kili in The Hobbit,\nvampire John Mitchell in Being\nHuman and Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nin Desperate Romantics, Turner has\nlanded a role that might haunt him,\nand even worse in TV terms, typecast\nhim, forever.\nAfter the first episode of the\nshow aired, in fact, all magazines\nand morning shows (which as we\nknow is where the real TV gossip\ncan be found) could focus on were\nAidan Turner\u2019s rugged looks. Thus\ncompletely ignoring Turner\u2019s, and\neveryone else\u2019s, relatively mediocre\nperformances.\nThe situation took a turn for the\nworse in episode 3, when Turner\nmade a habit of appearing without a\nshirt.\nThere are other characters in the\nshow, good ones even, like Ross\u2019s love\ninterest Demelza (played by Eleanor\nTomlinson), there are plotlines\nand cliff-hangers, the works, but I\nfear in a couple of weeks all we will\nremember is the scene where Poldark\nworks his field bare-chested. This one\nparticular scene caught the interest\nof warm-blooded women and farmers\nconcerned with health and safety\nalike.\nAdding to the distractions, the\nseries, which started off strong with\nan interesting story of love and loss\nand with just enough talk of war\nand poverty, ended on a real low on\nSunday. The finale was jam-packed\nwith half-hearted emotional plot-turns and it didn\u2019t help that the\nspecial effects guy was left loose, free\nto experiment with all his arsenal of\nfilters, providing a rather confusing\nwatch.\nThe real fall of Poldark, however,\ncould have been anticipated by\nabout the famous episode 3. Having\nbigged Ross up as the main male love\ninterest, and having provided him\nwith a contentious love triangle, the\nauthors decided to marry him off\nto one of the two ladies to focus on\nmore political themes. This is a noble\neffort, but one which comes with\nsome danger.\nIn order to write a period drama\naddressing the social injustice of the\nepoch, you definitely can\u2019t have half-naked hunks advertising the show. Of\ncourse you will attract attention, but\nit will be the wrong kind of attention,\nwith most of the viewers interested in\na little bit of light entertainment (the\nshow was aired on a Sunday night for\ncrying out loud).\nIn addition, you have to find\nsomething a little more engaging\nthan copper mines and smeltering\ncompanies, the details of which I\nstill fail to understand. All in all,\nPoldark was a fun substitute for\nCall the Midwife on BBC\u2019s Sunday\nprogramming, and certainly a more\nlight-hearted one. It taught most of us\na lot about 1780s Cornwall, an almost\nvirgin land full of copper, beautiful\nflowers and great accents (though not\nfrom Turner, who can barely hide his\nnative Irish twang).\nIt also taught us about Aidan\nTurner\u2019s abs, although these were\nhardly a mistery after his efforts in\nDesperate Romantics to bare all the\nskin possible.\nSeeing how empty the underlying\nthemes are and how averge most of\nthe storylines can be, I will probably\nnot be tuning in for season 2, which\nhas already been confirmed, but 5.9M\nviewers probably disagree with me.\nThe stunning location of Broadchurch.

They used\ndemographic and health survey data\nfrom 2000 up until the first Ebola\noutbreak in March 2014.\nThey found that without any\nmedical care whatsoever, the number\nof cases of malaria rise by 45% in\nGuinea, 88% in Sierra Leone, and an\nincredible 140% in Liberia. This is\nequivalent to 3.5 million cases of the\ndisease, and a further 10,000 malaria-attributable deaths. Half of these\ncases would affect children under five\nyears of age.\nHowever, the researchers also found\nthat mass drug administration and\ndistributing more insecticide-treated\nmosquito nets could mitigate the\neffect somewhat.\n\u201cThe on-going Ebola epidemic in\nparts of west Africa\u2026 [is] threatening\nto jeopardise progress made in\nmalaria control and elimination over\nthe past decade,\u201d said lead author Dr\nPatrick Walker.\n\u201cIn heavily affected Ebola areas\nthe indirect impact of Ebola upon\nmalaria deaths is likely to be of a\nsimilar magnitude to the public\nhealth burden caused by cases of\nEbola directly.\u201d\nAnother research group based\nat the MRC Centre for Outbreak\nAnalysis & Modelling, collaborated\nwith the World Health Organisation,\nalongside researchers from the\nUniversity of Toronto and the\nUniversity of British Columbia to\naddress the demographics the disease\nis hitting hardest.\nThe group of researchers found that\nthe disease progresses more quickly\nand is more likely to be fatal for\nchildren under five. 90% of children\nunder the age of one fall fatal to the\ndisease too, compared to 80% of those\ninfected that are aged one to four.\nNearly 4,000 children under sixteen\nhave suffered from the disease since\nthe epidemic began over a year ago,\nand the proportion of those effected\nby Ebola who are children is also\nincreasing over time.\nTheir research found that children\ninfected with Ebola have a shorter\nincubation period then adults,\nwith those under one year of age\non average harbouring the virus\nfor 6.9 days before presenting with\nsymptoms.\nNot only that, but the researchers\nfound that symptoms are generally\ndifferent for those of different ages.\nYounger children are less likely to\npresent with abdominal, joint or\nmuscle pain, but are more likely to\nhave a fever.\nProfessor Christl Donnelly, a\nco-author of the study, said: \u201cThese\nWeeks hall is to remain\nclosed for the next\nacademic year despite\nstudents petitioning to save the space,\nand the student Union Council voting\nto campaign against the closure.\nThe Imperial College Union\nPresident, Tom Wheeler, announced\nin his report to council detailing his\nrecent activity that he was unable\nto overturn the decision to close the\nhall, after contacting Muir Sanderson,\nThe Chief Financial Officer of the\ncollege. Wheeler was told that the\nProvost board has already made the\ndecision, and they were not prepared\nto overturn their decision.\nThis follows the furore last term\nwhen, back in February, council\ninitially voted to allow the closure of\nthe Weeks hall, after being told the\nspace could be used for childcare to\nmake the university more attractive\nto female academics.\nHowever the first vote resulted\nin equal number of students being\neither for or against campaigning to\nsave the hall. A second vote ran saw\nthe council narrowly deciding not to\ncampaign against the closure.\nWeeks hall committee members\nwere left outraged at the decision,\nespecially since they were not\nconsulted before the announcement\nto close the hall reached Council.\nRecruitment for hall seniors was\nalready underway at the time, as\nthe residents were all under the\nassumption the hall would still be in\nuse for the next academic year.\nNeither Imperial College Union\nor College have yet to accept\nresponsibility for not informing the\nresidents of the hall of the closure.\nThe hall committee then arranged\na petition to call for an emergency\ncouncil meeting in March, and\nresidents of the halls turned up in\nlarge numbers to argue the benefits of\nkeeping the hall open. Union Council\nthen voted again, this time in favour\nof campaigning against the closure.\nChris Kaye, Deputy President\n(Welfare) is also liaising with the\ndirector of Human Resources,\nLouise Lindsey, to ensure there will\nbe maximised space available for\nchildcare provision with the Weeks\nbuilding.\nProperty in the North of Princes\nGardens will also be used for various\npurposes, which will be primarily\n\u2018academic\u2019 related, although no\nspecifics have been released as to what\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\"Union\nCouncil then\nvoted again,\nthis time in\nfavour of\ncampaigning\nagainst the\nclosure\"\n\"...unable\nto overturn\nthe decision\nto close the\nhall\"\n\"The ongoing Ebola\nepidemic...\n[is]\nthreatening\nto jeopardise\nprogress\nmade in\nmalaria\ncontrol and\nelimination\"\n\"Ebola\naffects young\nchildren\nquite\ndifferently\nto adults.\"\nfindings show that Ebola affects\nyoung children quite differently to\nadults, and it\u2019s especially important\nthat we get them into treatment\nquickly.\n\u201cWe also need to look at whether\nyoung children are getting treatment\nthat\u2019s appropriate for their age.\u201d\nThe MRC Centre for Outbreak\nAnalysis and Modelling is based at\nImperial\u2019s St Mary\u2019s Campus, in West\nLondon.\nFounded in 2007, the Centre aims\nto research disease spread to better\nprepare for and shape responses to\nepidemics.\nThose working at the Centre are\ncurrently analysing and modelling\nthe spread of diseases such as SARS,\navian flu, swine flu, alongside Ebola\nand malaria.\nthis would entail yet.\nWheeler also noted in his report\nthat Pembridge hall will remain open\nfor a further three years, although\nits derelict annex at the top of the\nbuilding and the surrounding garden\nwill be converted into houses, that\nwill then be sold to fund other college\nventures.\nAn Imperial spokesperson told\nFelix: The internal structure and\nlisted status of the building means\nit would be difficult to refurbish\nit as a hall of residence to bring it\nin line with the standards of other\naccommodation. These structural\nissues mean there is little scope for\nexpansion in bed spaces, rendering\nthe refurbishment cost per bed space\nprohibitive.\n\u201cImperial is currently exploring\nother options for the future use of the\nsite.\u201d\n\n"

The first teaser\ndidn\u2019t offer a huge amount in the\nway of details, and while the new\nteaser still isn\u2019t what could be called\nforthcoming there\u2019s certainly a lot to\ntake in.\nThe opening shot is instantly iconic\n- a slow pan across a desert planet\nthat\u2019s since been named as Jakku (not\nTatooine, the series\u2019 previous sandy\nlandscape) that reveals a downed\nX-wing, and behind it, a crashed Star\nDestroyer.\nThere\u2019s a voiceover that sounds\nlike it might be Mark Hamill\u2019s Luke\nSkywalker, taking about the presence\nof the Force in his family over shots\nof Darth Vader\u2019s melted helmet, Luke\n(we think - there\u2019s a lot of speculation\nin this trailer) placing a mechanical\nhand on R2-D2 and someone\n(presumably Leia, going by the\ndialogue) being handed a lightsaber.\nAs the voiceover concludes, the\nestablishing shots start to come thick\nand fast. There\u2019s another look at the\nX-Wings skimming across the lake\nfrom the first teaser, replete with a\nfar more excited Poe Dameron (Oscar\nIsaac).\nOther highlights include the\nfirst close-up of Daisy Ridley, the\npreviously unknown soon-to-be-star,\nas Rey, as well as confirmation that\nJohn Boyega\u2019s Finn is a stormtrooper\nof some kind. Throw in a glimpse of\nKylo Ren, the film\u2019s big bad, more of\nthe Millenium Falcon and a chrome-plated stormtrooper, and Star Wars\nlooks very exciting indeed...\nJACK STEADMAN\nSECTION EDITOR\nThis Week\nat Imperial\nCinema\nImperial Cinema are back for the\nnew term,and with InherentVice\nalready under our belts we\u2019re\nalready looking to the Academy\nAwards for our next film...\nUp next,the Oscar-winning\nJulianne Moore stars in Still\nAlice,the story of an American\nprofessor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\nMoore is undeniably the\nhighlight of the film,in a role\nthat saw her sweep virtually\nevery Best Actress award going,\nbut there\u2019s still much more\nbesides to recommend.\nBased on the best-selling\nnovel of the same name,Still\nAlice features an all-star cast\nalongside Moore,including Alec\nBaldwin,Kristen Stewart and\nKate Bosworth.\nWritten and directed by\nRichard Glazer and Wash\nWestmoreland,this intimate,\nunderstated film is a powerful\nlook at Alzheimer\u2019s and how it\ncan affect those we love.\nStill Alice is playing at Imperial\nCinema on Tuesday 5th\nMay and\nThursday 7th\nMay at 19:00.\nTickets are \u00a33 for members and\n\u00a34 for non-members.\nDoors open around 15 minutes\nbefore the start of the film.\nTo buy membership or to find\nout more information,visit:\nimperialcinema.co.uk.\n\"It\u2019s one\nof the\nyear\u2019s best\nreleases so\nfar, and\nwell worth\na watch.\"\nand insecurity. \u00d6stlund suggests\nthat men are oppressed by society\u2019s\nexpectation for them to be heroic in\ndangerous situations.\nEven after overwhelming evidence\nto the contrary, Tomas does not\nadmit that he, as an individual, was\nscared. A breezy, \u201cwe were terrified\u201d\nis the closest he can get, speaking\nfor his wife and children as a sneaky\nemployment of safety in numbers.\nThis film is smart, sharply written\nand well-observed, a deserving winner\nof the 2014 Cannes Un Certain\nRegard Prize.\nThe only complaint is that it feels\na touch long but this only adds to\nthe impression of time dragging on\nthe holiday from hell. It\u2019s one of the\nyear\u2019s best releases so far and well\nworth a watch.\nWe may all condemn Tomas from\na position of relative safety but until\nthat situation is upon us, can we truly\nknow how we would respond?\n\u00d6stlund\u2019s script cleverly explores\nthe concept of masculinity and\nreverses traditional gender\nstereotypes: Ebba is the hero while\nTomas is the coward.\nIt\u2019s always heartening to see a\nstrong female protagonist and\nEbba is no exception. She is a well-rounded character with strength and\nincisiveness as well as vulnerability.\nShe does not wait to be rescued like\na typical damsel in distress, instead\nshowing courage and demanding the\nsame of her husband.\nShe\u2019s not perfect though. She\nsidesteps every opportunity to discuss\nthe avalanche with the children,\npresumably because the actual events\nare too painful to explain so she\nplumps for saying nothing.\nInterestingly, the women are the\nmost sympathetic characters, being\nfairly level-headed and reasonable,\nwhile the men are the least likeable\nwith their fragile balance of bravado\n\"In a split-second\ndecision,\nTomas\ngrabs his\nphone and\nruns.\"\nABENA TAYLOR-SMITH\nWRITER\nFORCE MAJEURE\nDirector: Ruben \u00d6stlund\nScreenplay: Ruben \u00d6stlund\nCast: Johannes Kunke, Lisa\nLoven Kongsli, Vincent\nWettergren, Clara Wettergren,\nKristofer Hivju\nPhoto: JJ Abrams/Disney\t\t\t\t\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\nFELIX 01.05.2015\nEverything you need to know to cast your vote\nThe General Election 2015\nCameron looks forward and attempts to ignore Miliband\u2019s hungry eyes and Clegg\u2019s cheeky grin. Photo: Creative Commons\nJust how do you decide who to vote for?\nThe novelist and essayist\nGeorge Orwell once said that\npolitical language is \u201cdesigned\nto make lies sound truthful and\nmurder respectable, and to give an\nappearance of solidity to pure wind.\u201d\nHe wrote that over half a century ago,\nbut it is just as relevant today as it was\nthen. Perhaps even more so.\nThere is undoubtedly a problem\nwith how political language is\nperceived by the public. Many people\nfeel that politicians are not direct or\nhonest with the electorate, and are\nconstantly dodging questions and\ntwisting the narrative in an effort to\nappeal to everyone. There is an aroma\nof mild deception to the whole game,\nbut you can see why politicians do\nit. They can\u2019t get a whole lot done if\ntheir party comes in second.\nPolitics is all about the future. This\nmeans politicians get into power by\nmaking promises, which are often\nabout quite abstract, intangible ideas.\nSo straight talking is hard to find,\nbecause politicians are not in the\nbusiness of candid communication\nand transparency. They are in the\nbusiness of breaking their messages\ndown into sound bites and slogans\nthat will resonate with as much\nof the electorate as possible. This\nis not necessarily a terrible thing.\nGreat speeches need to weave policy\nwith high ideals, but the problem is\nthat political discussion is totally\nsmothered by precisely framed\nplatitudes and clich\u00e9s, with little\nsubstance to them. It\u2019s a tricky\nbalance and not really the fault of any\nsingle group of people, just a reaction\nto incentives.\nI\u2019m sure many politicians would\nprefer it if they were able to speak\nfreely and debate their opponents\nopenly, but by outlining your policies\nclearly you are reducing the number\nof people who readily agree with\nyou. Instead, by running a generic\ncampaign you are able to appeal to\nas many people as possible, because\nthere is little to disagree with them\nabout. But this isn\u2019t good for the\ncountry.\nEven the party manifestos are\npacked full of generic promises about\na \u201cbrighter future\u201d or a \u201cbetter plan,\u201d\nand very few people have the time, or\nthe patience, to meticulously analyse\neach party\u2019s intentions.\nSo, how does one go about deciding\nwhom to vote for?\nWell, voting for policies over\npersonalities is crucial. Having a\ncompetent leader is of course very\nimportant, but ultimately it\u2019s the\npolicies that directly affect our lives\nand make a lasting impact.\nAfter that, it\u2019s a question of\nassessing the pros and cons of\neach policy platform, taking into\nconsideration the policy areas that\nmatter most to you, each party\u2019s\nrecord of delivery and whether the\npolicies seem realistic. It can be the\ncase that a policy that sounds great is,\non closer inspection, detrimental in\nthe long term.\nIt could be that you have a very\nstrong view about a particular issue,\nwhich would take priority over all\nthe other policies. For instance, you\nmight feel very strongly that Scotland\nshould not break up from the rest\nof the United Kingdom. This might\nlead you to vote tactically for the\nConservatives or Liberal Democrats\nin order to minimise the impact\nof the SNP over the life of the next\nparliament.\nThere are some crucial dividing\nlines between the parties. Labour,\nthe Conservatives and the Liberal\nDemocrats have agreed to further\nausterity cuts over the next\nparliament, which Ukip largely\nsupport. The Green Party, Plaid\nCymru and the Scottish National\nJoshua Renken ponders the perils and pitfalls of picking a politician\nParty are all anti-austerity and\nhave promised to modestly increase\ngovernment spending.\nWhen voting, it is important to\nbe aware of the political landscape\nwithin your constituency, to see\nwhether your vote will make a\nsignificant difference to who\nwins. For many voters there is a\nvalid argument to vote tactically,\nparticularly if you know you live in\na marginal constituency that could\n\u2018swing\u2019 to another party.\nYou might consider voting\ndown the front running candidate\nyou dislike - a compromise that\nwould help to get a more agreeable\ncandidate elected. To look at your\nconstituency\u2019s profile go to http://\ndemocraticdashboard.com.\nOnline questionnaires and political\nparty comparison sites such as www.\nwhoshouldyouvotefor.com and www.\nvoteforpolicies.org.uk will give you a\ngood idea of whom you align with. It\nis also possible to go online and look\nat how your local MP has voted.\nMany people think, quite sensibly,\nthat election campaigns are about\ncompeting answers to the same\nquestion.\nThey\u2019re not. They\u2019re a fight over the\nquestion itself.\nLabour wants people thinking\nabout inequality and the NHS.\nThe Conservatives want people\nthinking about the economy and\nstrong leadership. Lib Dems want\npeople thinking about fairness\nand a compassionate approach to\nfiscal recovery, while Ukip want the\nconversation to be about immigration\nand the EU. You get the idea.\nEven if you don\u2019t get the candidate\nyou voted for, you will have helped\nreduce the size of the majority for\nthe winning candidate, making him\nor her less complacent about their\nvictory so that they work harder\nfor their constituents ready for the\nnext election. By voting you also\nrepresent your age group, and the\nlarger the number of a group of\npeople going out to vote, the harder\nit is for politicians to ignore that\ngroup\u2019s interests over other groups.\nOld people love to vote, young people\ndon\u2019t. So tuition fees increase and\npensions are protected. These policy\npriorities can shift if enough young\npeople vote.\nDeciding whom to vote for is\nadmittedly a difficult decision to\nmake. But it is important to exercise\nyour freedom to have a say in how the\ncountry is run.\n\n"

This switch in functional\ndominance renders these systems\nmore vulnerable to future change.\nWhether you be trekking through a\ntropical forest or taking your dog out\nfor a walk, snorkelling with tortoises\nor dipping your toes in Cornish\nwaters, in any terrestrial, marine or\naquatic environment, vertebrates\nmay catch your eye but most of the\ntime you are the visitor of a primarily\ninvertebrate world. Edward O. Wilson\nhas called them \u201cthe little things that\nrun the world,\u201d and invertebrates\ntruly are the movers and shakers\nof tropical ecosystems, vastly\noutweighing their more charismatic\nvertebrate companions in abundance\nand diversity. One could even call\nthem the true kings of the jungle.\nThese little critters are the\nfoundations of life across many\necosystems but their importance\nis most prominent in tropical\nrainforests. If left untouched by\nmankind\u2019s chainsaw and caterpillar\ntractor, beetles and termites, ants\nand earthworms can go about their\nbusiness with relative ease and help\ndecompose decaying matter like\nfallen leaves. Through digestion\nand egestion, the release of essential\nnutrients such as nitrates and\nphosphorous helps fuel the growth of\nthe surrounding fauna. Seeds off trees\nare carried, munched and dispersed\nacross the forest floor by these little\ncreatures, which helps maintain\nthe vast diversity of tree species.\nAnd carnivorous ants and spiders\ncan scuttle about, preying on these\ninsatiable herbivorous invertebrates,\nthus keeping them in check so they\ndon\u2019t much through all the foliage,\ndead or alive.\nUnfortunately, as a consequence\nof globalisation and the growing\ndemand from an expanding human\npopulation, intense legal and illegal\nlogging currently threatens half\nof the world\u2019s rainforests. The\ncaterpillar tractors are fired up\nand chainsaws roar. In particular,\nthe clearing of land for palm\noil and timber plantations has\nrendered Borneo\u2019s rainforest\nalmost unrecognisable, with an area\nalmost the size of Belgium having\nbeen cut down between 1985 and\n2001 to supply the global timber\ngluttony. As a consequence of this,\nthese little \u201cmovers and shakers\u201d of\nforest ecosystems have been severely\nhit, with many species being lost\naltogether.\nSo with these integral cogs\ngone, what happens to the overall\nfunctioning of tropical rainforests?\nWell, surprisingly very little. In fact,\nnew research from Imperial College\nLondon\u2019s Department of Life Sciences\nhas indicated that tropical rainforests\nare actually very resilient to change.\nWhat does change, however, are\nthe type of creatures that perform\nthese vital functions. By excluding\neither invertebrates or vertebrates\nfrom patches of both logged and\nunlogged rainforest in Borneo, the\nresearchers were table to determine\ntheir contribution to three ecosystem\nfunctions: leaf litter decomposition,\nleaf-eating invertebrate predation\nand seed disturbance. The team found\nthat in logged forests, vertebrates\nplayed a more dominant functional\nrole and increased in abundance\ncompared to primary (untouched)\nforest patches.\n\u201cInvertebrates are often thought of\nas the controllers of tropical forests,\nso it\u2019s surprising that mankind\ncan upset their dominance to this\nlevel,\u201d said Dr Robert Ewers, lead\nauthor of the study. For example, in\npristine primary forests predation\non herbivorous invertebrates is\nalmost entirely performed by other\ninvertebrates. However, in logged\nforests their contribution to this\nfunction is cut by 40% and animals\nsuch as mice and tree shrews pick up\nthe slack.\nSimilar trends were seen for seed\ndisturbance rates. However, leaf\nlitter decomposition rates were\nunaffected by lack of invertebrates\nand it was not a function taken\nup by the vertebrates. Instead the\nteam hypothesise that in the altered\nmicroclimate in logged forests\nleading to reduced humidity and\nincreased air temperature as well\nas altered activities of soil bacteria\ncould have helped decomposition to\ncontinue.\nAlthough the ecosystem\ncan continue to function with\nvertebrates usurping the throne from\ninvertebrates, the rainforests are\nleft more vulnerable to disturbance\nthan before. \u201cThe forest will keep\nmaintaining itself, but it will be much\nmore susceptible to further change.\nRelying on vertebrates is a bad tactic,\u201d\nDr Ewers elucidates. \u201cKnocking out\none or two invertebrates might not\nbe too bad, as there are many others\nto take their place, but knocking out\none or two vertebrates could now be\ndisastrous.\u201d\nIntrinsic susceptibility of\nvertebrates to a range of human\npressures has seen their threat\nstatus steadily rise over the last two\ndecades. Increased reliance on them\nis therefore likely to render these\nsystems more vulnerable to future\ndisturbances. Invertebrates still\nremain an important actor in logged\nforests, but as the area of pristine\nforest shrinks to less than a third\nof the world\u2019s forest area, their role\nseems to have switched from true\nkings of the jungle to jesters of the\ncrown court.\n\"Logging\ncurrently\nthreatens\nhalf of the\nworld\u2019s\nrainforest.\"\n\"Most of\nthe time\nyou are\nvisitor to a\nprimarily\ninverteba-te world.\"\nDemand for palm oil has driven the destruction of the rainforest in Borneo.

Imperial\nchemistry graduate, Douglas\nHunt, is one such scientist turned\nentrepreneur, although his idea\ncomes with a novel twist: Doug has\nretrofitted a fire engine into a beer-dispensing-festival-serving device\nunder his company Pour Your Pint.\nDoug studied chemistry at Imperial,\nbefore spending a year as a sabbatical\nofficer for Imperial College Union.\nWhen he left Imperial, he went on\nto work in the field of accountancy,\nwhere he met his other two business\npartners, Laurence Culloty and\nLaurence Tarr.\nI caught up with Laurence Culloty\nlast Saturday in in Tottenham Hale to\ndiscuss craft beer, their plans for the\nfuture, and the political influence of\nAl Murray.\nAfter the longest tube journey\nI\u2019ve ever taken, I emerged from the\ntube station, immediately seeing a\ncrowd of bearded twenty-somethings.\nAlready I had an inkling that they\nwere probably going to a craft\nbeer brewery, and sure enough,\nafter following the bearded crowd\nI eventually found the industrial\nestate, they were there, right next to a\nbeer dispensing fire engine.\nThe fire engine in question has six\nself-service points supplied by one of\nPour Your Pints\u2019 partners, Robot Pub\nGroup, with each one of them being\nable to be filled with any beverage of\nthe event organiser\u2019s choice. Their\nwebsite boasts: \u201cWe realise that\npeople enjoy drinks bars most when\nthey are part of the action. That\u2019s why\nwe created the worlds first fire truck\nmobile outdoor bar which features\nself serve technology.\u201d\nLaurence remarked that the\nidea originally came about when\nhe and his other future business\npartners were in a long queue at\na festival waiting for a beer, and\ngetting increasingly frustrated over\nmissing the acts. They thought that\nthere had to be a quicker way to get\na beer, and, after copious research,\nthey discovered that the self-service\ntechnology existed, and so decided to\nfind a way to bring it to the portable\nmarket.\nThe fire engine as a method\nof transportation was originally\nLaurence\u2019s father\u2019s idea, stemming\nfrom a friend that converted a\nfire engine into a radio station\nover thirty years ago. The three\naccountants researched began to look\nfor something that could transport\nitself easily. They initially had a\nlook at slipstream caravans and the\nRoutemaster buses, but in the end\nthey felt that the fire engine wasn\u2019t\nreally something that had been done\nbefore. After a tense but successful\nventure onto eBay, the fire engine was\npurchased.\nLuckily there weren\u2019t too many\nobstacles in financing their business,\nsince it was from their collective\npersonal savings. Laurence did admit\nto me that their cash flow was not\nideal at this moment in time, but\ntheir collective optimism for their\nbusiness has made the investment\nworth it in their minds.\nIn the next five years Laurence\nhoped to expand the business to a\nwider market, making themselves the\nprime company when it comes to self-service technology to the festivals and\nevents market.\nSomewhat bizarrely, the fire engine\nhas attracted considerable attention\nfrom Al Murray, the comedian whose\nact centres around the musings of\na typical pub landlord. Al Murray\nrecently travelled in the fire engine\nas a way to announce his satirical\ncampaign in the upcoming election\nin the Thanet constituency, running\nagainst Nigel Farage, leader of the\nUKIP.\nLaurence told how it originated\nfrom the Robot Pub group who\nhad a contact in the Avalon group\n(Al Murray\u2019s agent), and they were\ntalking about the Pour Your Pint\nventure late one night, and he was\ntalking about his political venture. He\ncontacted Pour Your Pint and next\nthing you know, he was riding in the\nengine through the streets of Thanet.\nWhen I asked Laurence if he\nhad any thoughts on the nature of\nhis satire and the state of British\npolitics, Laurence was initially quite\ncautious, declaring that he wasn\u2019t\ngoing to broadcast his political views,\nobviously quite wary of his new\ncompany\u2019s reputation.\nHe did admit that there were\ncertain elements of Murray\u2019s\nperformance that had an element of\ntruth to them: one quip Murray said\nwas that although many politicians\nbreak their promises, he was going\nto promise to not keep any of his\npromises. \u201cI think there\u2019s definitely\nan element of truth to that\u201d, Laurence\nreplied, before we went and got\nanother pint.\nCraft beer has increased in\npopularity over the past few years,\neven being added to the basket of\ngoods for calculating inflation;\nhowever I was curious as to whether\nor not this is just a transient fad.\nDuring the course of the day,\nBeavertown brewery opened its doors\nto those that had come to the event,\nrevealing a giant warehouse with\nseveral large distilleries.\nOpened in 2011, Beavertown has\ngone from strength to strength,\nbefore moving to Tottenham Hale in\nMay 2014. I managed to talk to one of\nthe brewers about the merits of craft\nbeer: \u201cOnce you get distilleries of this\nsize, it gets really difficult to make a\nshit beer and I think to make a good\ncraft beer there has to be something\nunique about it.\u201d\nLaurence also sounded in on this\nstating that \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more\nvariety of flavours, and ability to\nexperiment with craft beers.\u201d\nThis was definitely true with many\nof Beavertown\u2019s brands: there was a\nparticularly interesting Grapefruit\nIPA (Indian Pale Ale), as well as a\nMain photo: the engine in action.

Bottom left:\nowners of the truck Photo: Jonathan Masters\n\u201cCraft\nBeer has\nincreased\nin\npopularity\nover the\npast few\nyears.\u201d\n\u201cI was\ncurious as\nto whether\nor not this\nis just a\ntransient\nfad.\u201d\n\n"

An\nexample being the away match vs\nKent University, for which, due to\nillnesses and work deadlines, the\nteam travelled with only the bare\nminimum of six players (our libero\nhaving to play opposite).\nNot having the luxury of\nsubstitutes, the 5-set match left the\nplayers exhausted. Even though it\nwas a 3-2 loss our players should be\nproud of the fight they put up in\nthis extremely close match. By the\nend of the season, the IC women\u2019s\nBUCS team took the third place\nin the league, only below the well-deserved first place for University\nof East London and second place for\nUniversity College London. The final\nleague standings only confirm that\nthe team deserved the promotion to\nfirst division.\nThe men\u2019s BUCS team looked\npromising with a number of\nreturning players as well as new\nhigh-level recruits. The men were on\ncourse for a promotion to the Premier\nLeague, having only lost their away\nmatch to Portsmouth.\nAll hopes were therefore placed\non the Portsmouth home match as\na win would have resulted in a first\nThe Men\u2019s team receiving the BUCS trophy Photo: ICVC\nplace in the league and a promotion\nplay-off match. Unfortunately, the\ngreat success the men were achieving\nin their Trophy competition, meant\nclashes with league matches and\nmuch rescheduling, ultimately\nresulting in the men\u2019s team having to\nplay three crucial matches in the final\nweek of the BUCS season.\nThe home match against\nPortsmouth ended up having to be\nplayed in a training slot and with\nsome challenging circumstances\nthe men\u2019s team were unfortunately\nunable to reach their full potential,\nlosing 3-1 to a strong Portsmouth.\nRegardless of the disappointment\nof not getting first position in the\nleague the men were determined to\ncome away with a win for the BUCS\nTrophy competition. Throughout the\nTrophy knockout matches the men\nremained undefeated, not even losing\na single set.\nOvercoming many worries and\nuncertainties about the Final in\nLoughborough (the match being on a\nTuesday in the final week of term(!)),\nthe whole team eventually made it to\nthe final match.\nSpecially thanks to the support\nof Sport Imperial who were\ninstrumental in ensuring player\navailability and transport. The result\nspeaks for itself, the BUCS men\nbecame BUCS Trophy Champions\nin an impressive performance in\na match of just under an hour,\ndefeating Northumbria 2nd\n3-0 (25-16,\n25-8, 25-13).\nBesides the competitive success,\nthe Club had many other greats and\nfirsts this season expanding our\nreach as a club beyond the volleyball\ncommunity at Imperial. ICVC\nintroduced charity matches, raising\nmoney on two occasions for the\ncharities Prostate Cancer and MAG\n(Mines Advisory Group) respectively.\nThe Club also had numerous mixed\ntraining sessions including friendly\nmixed tournaments, always with\nchocolate prizes!\nFood is also generally the focal\npoint at our socials, having many\nskilled cooks and bakers among\nour members, bringing dishes such\nas tiramisu, spanakopita, lemon\ncheesecake, brownies and much more\nhome-made goodness.\nFollowing on from this year, we\ncannot wait to see what next season\nbrings!\n\n"

After a speech,\nmade up of fine words with a rare\nelegance, reminding us of the long\nhistory of love we have with Medics,\nthe team was ready for battle.\nAfter a light observation round, IC\nstarted to gain possession, eventually\nleaving the referee with no choice\nbut to blow his whistle for IC (yes, his\nwhistle was still working at this time).\nAfter a first touch not found, the\nsecond penalty hit the mark.\nA good lineout maul advanced ten\nmeters with the ball coming into\nthe hands of Bruno \u201cJules Plisson\u201d\n\u201cflair god\u201d \u201cbaguette man\u201d Villatte.\nA signature dummy back pass with\nTom Murray bamboozled the low IQ\nmedics, with only the fullback was\nstill able to defend. Very good support\nby Syarif \u201c3s convert\u201d Hertog made\nit a 2-on-1, and a try under the posts.\n7 - 0\nDespite the wind, IC had the only\nreal attacking opportunities for the\nfirst 30 minutes, this was helped\nlargely by the numerous knock-ons from Medics\u2019 backline. More\nawesome work from IC\u2019s forwards\nallowed the ball to be quickly ejected\nby Luke \u201cEl President\u00e9\u201d Armitage\n(surely helped by his new hair cut).\nBruno took full advantage and,\nwithout his pair of centers, feinted\nthe pass and broke the line on 30m\nfinally using some flair footwork\nto score second try of the game.\nUnfortunately he had the same\nsuccess as Haimona for the kick and\nfailed in the conversion. 12 - 0\nThe last ten minutes of the first\nhalf were one-sided in favour of the\nMedics, who took advantage of hand\nmistakes from IC\u2019s players. After\n5min of intensive rush defence right\nin front of the goal line, Jono \u201cCaptain\nTransport\u201d Stancombe took one for\nthe team, getting himself binned. Ten\nscrums on the five meters line later,\nthe Medics finally scored. 12 - 5\nHalf-time: Imperial College\n3rd\nXV 12 - 5 Imperial Medics\n3rd\nXV\nThe second half began in a similar\nway to the first, IC still strong in\ndefence but now, with the wind in\nour favour, the pressure was easy\nto put on the Medics. Outrageous\nscrum domination by IC, sadly\ndidn\u2019t materialised in penalties.\nNevertheless, IC quickly returned\ninto the opposites 22. After another\ngood lineout maul, next year\u2019s 3s\nCaptain Matt \u201cport connoisseur\u201d\nKettle got the score. Another\nconversion missed by Bruno; he\nseemed more comfortable with his\nhands than with his feet today. 17 - 5\nIn spite of the desire to play a\nbeautiful rugby, the first part of the\nsecond half was poor.\nToo many hand mistakes on both\nsides meant neither side could gain\nany momentum.\nEven the whistle of the referee\ndecided to stop working. This gave the\nopportunity of a mini break, whilst\nthe ref made the slow-but-steady jog\nto get another whistle.\nHalf-half-time: Imperial\nCollege 3rd\nXV 17 - 5 Imperial\nMedics 3rd\nXV\nAfter this unexpected break, IC\nstarted to keep the ball and a penalty\ngave the opportunity to approach\nthe line. A good lineout and a strong\nmaul after, Matt fell just over the goal\nline for his second try! Thankfully no\none notice the conversion was missed,\nnot that it was needed. 22 - 5\nThe medics continued to try to\nbreak the defence but the pressure\nand some big tackles from IC players\nforced them to make mistakes.\nAfter knock-on from Medics,\nscrum down. The ball went straight\nthrough the channel, unusually the\nreferee decided that the game should\ncontinue, resulting in the Medics\nrecovering the ball in front of the\nincredulous eyes of IC\u2019s players. After\n3 or 4 quick passes to the wing where\nIC\u2019s players were not in a defensive\nposition, the Medics scored their\nsecond try of the game. 22 - 10.\nFrustrated by this try, IC really\nwanted to finish this Varsity game on\na high note.\nThe pressure was very intense\ninside the medics 22 and after a good\nchange of direction in the game called\nby Syarif, and great 2-on-1, Bruno\ndived over for the second time. Bruno\nfinally decided to let Syarif take the\nkicking responsibility who added the\nextras. 29 - 10.\nNot satisfied, IC continued to play,\nthis time with one goal, flair. An\n2nd\nteam hundle, with one well dressed fan of the team in attendance\ntoo. Photo: Ben Lester www.throughbenslens.co.uk\nunreal attempt of a \u201cSonny Bill\u201d, off a\ngreat run from Tom \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the\nEnglish weakness\u201d Murray, ended in\na knock-on, 5 meters in front of the\ngoal line.\nA quite unbelievable turn of events\nhappened next, firstly out very own\nJon Lineham made an incredible line\nbreak, then he ran 50m to score a\nwonderful \u201cTeddy Thomas style\u201d try,\nonly for the the referee to go back to\na scrum, in FAVOUR of IC. No one is\nquite sure what happened.\nA very strong defence, massive\nperformance from the forwards and\nsome incredible French Flair, was just\ntoo much for the medics.\nVarsity 2015 was of to a great start!\nThat is, if the 3s would remember the\nrest of the day\u2026\n\n"

The School will\nbe housed at the former Post Office\nBuilding on Exhibition Road\nThe School will offer three courses\nnext academic year: a 4-year MEng\nin Design Engineering; and two\nMasters programs, one in Global\nDesign Engineering and another in\nInnovation Design Engineering (IDE).\nThe latter, with a 30-year history\nformerly under the Department of\nMechanical Engineering, is being\njointly offered in collaboration with\nthe Royal College of Art.\nOctober 2015 will see the School\u2019s\nfirst ever intake of students, where\nthe initial cohort will first use\nImperial\u2019s existing facilities. By\nOctober 2017, teaching is expected to\nmove to the new building: the former\nPost Office Building on Exhibition\nRoad which was purchased by\nImperial from the Science Museum.\nThe new School was made possible\nby a \u00a312m donation from the James\nDyson Foundation, which is the\ncharity\u2019s largest ever single gift. This\nis not the first time the Dyson name\nhas been involved with Imperial\nCollege London: Sir James Dyson is\na longstanding supporter of the IDE\nMasters program, and in 2014, Dyson\nLtd announced a \u00a35m investment in\na new robotics lab within Imperial.\nBye-bye ouchies: invisible\nmending for the human body\nResearchers at Imperial College\nLondon have developed a novel way\nto treat severe burns and assist in\norgan transplants. The team, led by\nMolly Stevens from the Institute\nof Biomedical Engineering, have\ndesigned sheets of silicon bandages\ncoated with nanoneedles for this\npurpose.\nThe idea is that the healing\ncapacity of tissues can be boosted\nby microscopically puncturing\nthousands of cells at once, delivering\na shot of DNA with each puncture.\nThere are many proposed uses for the\nresulting product; one major idea is to\nprevent unsightly burn scars during\nthe healing process. At present,\npatients have to wait until the healing\nprocess is complete before treating\nany discoloration and uneven\nsurfacing with plastic surgery, laser\nresurfacing and/or medical tattooing.\nOne of the key reasons of treatment\nby introducing DNA into cells is\nto reprogram how they respond to\ndamage. However, inserting DNA\ninto cells can be tricky: injections\nonly allow for one cell to receive\nnew DNA at a time, whereas using\ngenetically engineered viruses\n(perfect as they are nature\u2019s experts at\nhijacking cell DNA) cannot guarantee\nthat none of the virus\u2019 genes will\ncontaminate the process - something\npotentially lethal. The nanoneedle\nsilicon bandage, on the other hand,\nwill be safer and more efficient at\nreprogramming whole tissues.\nBig Brother really IS\nwatching you: better video\nemotion/likeability tracking\nsoftware to be developed\nTech outfit Realeyes, in conjunction\nwith Imperial College London, have\nreceived a \u20ac3.64m grant from the\nEuropean Commision for a project\nto improve the former\u2019s emotion-tracking technology.

IRCAM \u2013 l\u2019Institut\nde Recherche et Coordination\nAcoustique/Musique \u2013 was a hotbed\nof innovation, with computer\nscientists and acousticians working\ndirectly alongside composers.\nPioneering work on FM synthesis was\ncarried out and programmes for the\nreal-time modulation of sound were\ndeveloped (such as MAX). MAX has\nbeen instrumental in the creation of\nsome of the most important musical\ncompositions in recent decades, such\nas Birtwhistle\u2019s opera, The Mask of\nOrpheus. Boulez himself wrote a\nnumber of works in the early days of\nIRCAM, exploring the potential for\ncomputers to manipulate sound in\nreal-time, for example, in \u2018Repons\u2019\nwhere a programme is used to\nprovide an altered echo of certain\ninstruments.\nBoulez\u2019s music is difficult. It is\nunlike Mozart or Beethoven or\nanything heard before, and has not\nenjoyed broad public appeal (yet).\nBut his contributions are valuable;\nhis language is objective and free\nof any history, it is one of the most\nsuccessful responses to the events\nand conditions of the 20th\ncentury. If\npeople complain of its atonality and\ndifficulty, they should think of music\nfrom other cultures, which can sound\nequally alien and provide unequivocal\nevidence for tonal systems being the\nresult of cultural conditioning. In this\nway, Boulez\u2019s music can be seen as a\nuniversal music, rooted in the equally\nuniversal language of mathematics.\n\u201cThe strongest civilisations are those\nwithout memory - those capable of\ncomplete forgetfulness. They are strong\nenough to destroy because they know\nthey can replace what is destroyed. Today\nour musical civilisation is not strong\u201d\nUniversally popular it certainly\nisn\u2019t. Boulez\u2019s own diagnosis is\nthat people use music as a sort of\nbackdrop to their own thoughts\nwhile his music demands complete\nattention. Although unwilling\nto compromise on his duties as\ncomposer, as a conductor he has\nenjoyed international fame, winning\n26 Grammy awards and raising the\nprofile of 20th\nCentury music to the\nhighest acclaim it has enjoyed. In\nthe 70s he was musical director of\nboth the BBC Symphony Orchestra\n(in London) and the New York\nPhilharmonic, reinvigorating the\nmusical life of these two cities. In\nNew York, he organised \u2018rug concerts\u2019\nwhere audiences were exposed to\ncontemporary music in new ways.\nNow at 90 years old, he no longer\nconducts, and indeed achievements\nin the concert hall were only\ntransient, but I have no doubt that\nhis compositions will be remembered\nand become more widely understood\nin the future.\nPersonally, I have found exploring\nthe music of Pierre Boulez to be\none of my most rewarding musical\nexplorations. In my efforts to\nunderstand this language I have\nbeen taken back in time to medieval\nEurope and around the world. While I\nam still a huge fan of what historians\ncall \u2018common practice period\u2019 music,\nsuch as Beethoven and Mozart, and\nalso of more popular styles from\nthe last decades, I see now how the\nimmediate appeal of these styles is the\nresult of lifetime exposure. Attending\nthe Boulez at 90 events at the\nBarbican recently was an important\ncatalyst in my appreciation. With\na full day of concerts, talks, and\ndocumentaries I was thrown in at the\ndeep end, but quickly learnt to swim.\nI hope you will join me in exploring\nthe art of one of the most radical and\nforceful minds in modern music.\nInstitut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique \u00ad\n(IRCAM).

Each\nconstituency will have several MP candidates standing\nfor election, with candidates often being affiliated with\na main political party. Those that are not are called\n\u201cIndependent\u201d candidates.\nWhat are the main political parties in the\nUK?\nThree parties usually dominate the House of Commons,\nwhich are the Conservative party, the Labour party and\nthe Liberal Democrats. However, many other parties\nmay secure a small number of seats, including the\nGreen Party, or the United Kingdom Independence\nParty (UKIP). Each party has various political views and\nstances, which their MP candidates will generally also\nbe in favour of.\nHow many MPs are there?\nThere is one per constituency, and there are 650\nconstituencies across the whole of the UK.\nIn London due to the high population density,\nthere are 73 different constituencies, but generally\ncities have far fewer. The whole of Wales only has 40\nconstituencies for example, whilst Scotland has 59.\nThere are around 50,000 to 70,000 people in each\nconstituency.\nWho can be an MP?\nAnyone can stand as a Member of Parliament; they\nsimply need to be a British or Irish Commonwealth\ncitizen, and over 18. They cannot be a public official or\nofficeholder.\nWho decides who is Prime Minister?\nYou cannot vote on who is Prime Minister, as they\nare, by convention, appointed by the Monarch. The\nindividual who is considered \u201cto command the\nconfidence of the House of Commons\u201d and therefore\nthe usually the leader of the majority political party or,\nif there is a coalition, the leader of the party that holds\nthe most seats will be Prime Minister.\nWhat voting system does the general\nelection use?\nThe current system is called \u201cFirst Past the Post\u201d (FPTP).\nThis means you can only cast one vote for an MP\ncandidate, and the candidate that receives the most\nvote wins that seat and represents that constituency in\nthe House of Commons.\nHow does a party form the government?\nEach MP has a seat in the House of Commons, and the\nparty that wins the most seats forms the government.\nThis means that they can put their ideas and views into\npractise when running the country.\nA party needs to command more than half the\nseats to win, and the party that wins the second\nlargest seats becomes the \u201copposition\u201d party. If a party\ndoesn\u2019t command a majority of the seats, coalition\ngovernments may form. Parties come together until\nthey represent the majority of seats.\nFor the last General Election\nin 2010, Felix ran a similar\npoll and found that 56% of\nthose who responded intended to\nvote Liberal Democrats, 24% were\ngoing to vote for a Conservative\nParty candidate and only 16% were\nplanning on casting their vote for a\nLabour Party candidate.\nDespite this, the overwhelming\nmajority of students still predicted\nthat there would be Conservative win\nor hung parliament, which was, as we\nnow know, the outcome of the 2010\nGeneral Election.\nWith Nick Clegg promising back in\n2010 to scrap tuition fees, this may\nbe how his party garnered so much\nstudent support, although they also\nseemed to be pessimistic about if\nhe would ever actually take power.\nBack then, the Liberal Democrat\nmanifesto also had a visibly larger\nportion dedicated around\nscience policies,\nand had also\npledged not to\ncut the science\nbudget if they\nmade it into\npower.\nInterestingly,\na YouGov poll at\nthe time found\nthat 49% of all\nvoters would have\nactually voted for a\nLiberal Democrat, if\nthey thought the party\nactually had a shot at\nwinning and taking some\nof those safe seats from\nLabour or Conservative\ncandidates.\n35%of students\nwill be\nvoting for\nthe Conservative party this year,\nalthough a further 30% will be giving\nthe Labour party their vote, our Felix\nopinion poll shows.\nOnly 18% of students are voting for\nthe liberal democrats, a significant\ndrop in numbers since the last general\nelection poll that took place in 2010,\nwhen 56% said they would cast their\nvote for Nick Clegg and his crew. 9%\nof students said they would vote for\nthe Green Party, whilst 5% said they\nwould be giving Farage the seal of\napproval and voting for UKIP.\nWe asked a total of 189 students\nhow likely they will be voting next\nThursday in the General Elections;\nincredibly, 80% of students who\nresponded said they were very likely\nto vote, with only 6% of respondents\nsaying that they probably wouldn\u2019t\nbother.\nWhen we asked students to list what\ntopics mattered most to them, 34%\nof respondents said the Economy was\ntheir primary concern, and a further\n17% said they were most interested in\nhealthcare. 9% of respondents listed\nEducation as the top topic that they\nwere most interested in.\nNot surprisingly, none of the\nrespondents listed pensions, local\ngovernment or rural affairs as topics\nthey were most concerned about,\nalthough encouragingly 8% did list\nthe environment as something they\nwere most interested in.\nCompared with other universities,\nit seems Imperial has mirrored\nnational student statistics. In a\nsurvey questioning more than\n13,000 students nationwide, Labour\nand Conservative parties came up\nas equally popular, with 31% of the\nvote each. St Andrews students are\nmost likely to vote for Conservative\ncandidates, whilst the Green Party\nhas amassed a strong support with\nEdinburgh University students.\nCompared to national predictions\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nfrom electionforcast.co.uk, at the time\nof print, there are similar trends\nbetween the two datasets, although it\nshould be noted that the number of\nindividuals voting for a party does\nnot reflect the percentage of seats\nMPs will obtain in Parliament.\nConservative are expected to win\n279 out of the 650 seats available,\nwith Labour coming up close with\n270. Liberal Democrats are looking at\nsecuring 27 seats, with UKIP and the\nGreen Party winning 2 and just one\nseat respectively.\n\u201c34% of\nrespondents\nsaid the\nEconomy\nwas their\nprimary\nconcern\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 25\n01.05.2015\nFELIX\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOn Learning how to Love the Bomb\nThe story of the Manhattan\nProject, which saw the\nUnited States lead a team of\ninternational scientists developing\nthe first nuclear weapon, has gone\ndown in popular legend: Einstein\n(that most cuddly of nuclear\nphysicists) recommending that the US\nbegin work on \u2018extremely powerful\nbombs\u2019, mushroom clouds above the\nNew Mexican desert, and J. Robert\nOppenheimer quoting the Bhagavad\nGita - it\u2019s all been burned onto our\ncollective consciousness. Such a\nthing was surely a mixed blessing\nto playwright Tom Morton-Smith,\nwhose production detailing the\ncreation of \u2018The Bomb\u2019, Oppenheimer,\nhas transferred to London\u2019s West\nEnd, following a critically acclaimed\nrun in Stratford-upon-Avon. When\nthe public believe that they have a\ngood grasp on a piece of history - as I\nam sure a lot of people do about the\nManhattan Project - it can be difficult\nto make them see any other way;\nhowever, with Oppenheimer MortonSmith has created a finely scripted\nhistorical drama, which sticks\nclosely to the truth whilst still being\nentertaining, no doubt thanks to the\nfine cast of the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany.\nWe begin with the EinsteinSzli\u00e1rd letter, in which Roosevelt\nwas warned about the possibility\nof Hitler developing an atomic\nweapon; as a result, the brilliant J.\nRobert Oppenheimer, or \u2018Oppie\u2019communist, radical, genius - is called\nup to direct a team of internationally\nrenowned scientists (those working\non the project would eventually\ncome to include twenty Nobel\nlaureates). Moving from the west\ncoast to Los Alamos, New Mexico,\nwhose empty deserts allow scientific\ninspiration to \u2018find\u2019 Oppie; as his\npassion for the project builds,\nOppenheimer sacrifices his friends,\nhis family, and his very morality in\npursuit of scientific achievement.\nJohn Hefferman is brilliant as\nOppenheimer, creating a cocktail of\na character who is one part smooth,\nsophisticated revolutionary, one\npart mad scientist. Ben Allen and\nTom McCall are wonderful in their\nrespective roles of Edward Teller and\nHans Bethe, one all cold Hungarian\nintelligence, the other a model\nof Teutonic good-naturedness.\nSimilarly, Catherine Steadman\nbrings a bold physicality to her role\nof Jean Tatlock, the doomed lover of\nOppenheimer, who first introduced\nhim to radical politics - it\u2019s a pity,\nthen, that her part isn\u2019t nearly as\nfleshed out as I would have liked.\nIt is easy, with the privilege of\nhindsight, to condemn the naivety\nof the scientists involved. When\nOppenheimer claims that the nuclear\nbomb would mark \u2018an end to all\nwar\u2019, we can sit smug in our tower\nof dramatic irony, surveying the\nwreckage of Sarajevo, of Georgia, of\nGaza; but to take such an attitude is to\nbelittle the intentions of the scientists\ninvolved. What Oppenheimer does\nparticularly well is help to return the\nnuance to the arguments surrounding\nthe Manhattan Project: it was not a\nsimple case of American dominance,\nbut rather a campaign borne out of\nthe fear that the Nazis would get there\nfirst. The fact that a number of the\nscientists working at Los Alamos had\nfled the seemingly-unstoppable tide\nof European fascism helps to make\nthe issue a lot more complex than it\nmay appear at first.\nHowever, there are points within\nthe production when this desire to\npromote debate overstretches itself;\nthe result is a number of lengthy\nnear-monologues in which the\ncharacters grapple with the moral\nconfusion working on such a project\ncan bring, leading to a runtime which\n- at three hours long - certainly feels\nlike a bit of a drag. Perhaps as time\ngoes on the cast will be able to deliver\nsuch paragraphs with more pace, but\nit seems like Tom Morton-Smith\u2019s\nscript could certainly do with editing\ndown. Similarly, there are elements of\nthe play where subtle symbolism can\nspill over into psychological heavy-handedness: Oppenheimer can\u2019t feel\nlove for his baby because the bomb is\nhis child; the shroud of secrecy under\nwhich the project is carried out is\ncloser to fascism than the socialism\nthat he so loved; the scientists\nalways have purely knowledge-based\nmotivations, while the military (boo!)\nare only interested in personal gain.\nWhile these elements don\u2019t happen\ntoo often, they do feel like missteps,\njerking us out of the action with a\nsharp tug.\nThey are, however, partially offset\nby the skill with which Morton-Smith\ndeals with the scientific aspects of\nThe company of the RSC\u2019s Oppenheimer Photo: Keith Pattinson/RSC\nFred Fyles checks out RSC\u2019s play on the father of the A-bomb\n\"The\nheaviness\nof the\nscript is\noffset by\nthe skill\nwith which\nthe science\nis dealt\"\n\"John\nHefferman\nis brilliant\nas Oppie,\ncreating\na smooth\ncocktail of\na character\"\nthe story - he manages to strike a fine\nbalance between over- and under-information. As an audience we don\u2019t\nfeel spoken down to when the cast\nbegin describing the structure of the\natom (or at least, I didn\u2019t; perhaps if\nyou\u2019re studying nuclear physics such\nthings may seem a bit more slow), but\nthe theory never takes precedence\nover the plot; instead the two aspects\nwork in perfect tandem, with one\nbuilding and developing the other.\nThis is helped by the clever staging\ndesign, which gives every surface the\nability to become a blackboard - a\nclever nudge towards the stereotype\nof the genius scientist, madly\nscribbling away on any available\nspace. The set it dominated by the\ninterlinking girders upon which the\natomic bomb descends during the\nTrinity Test; like a pig-iron sword of\ndamocles, they remind the viewer\nthat there is only one way things can\nend: Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and over\n100,000 dead.\nDespite what Brian Cox\u2019s popularity\nwould seem to tell us, it\u2019s still difficult\nto make science \u2018sexy\u2019 (although\nperhaps not physics: the number of\npeople applying for physics degrees\nhas increased by 40% over four years).\nTherefore, we should applaud director\nAngus Jackson, who manages to steer\nhis RSC cast through a script that,\ndespite a few areas of weakness, is\ngenerally extremely solid. Subatomic\nphysics has rarely looked so good.\nOppenheimer is on at the Swan\nTheatre until 23rd\nMay.
