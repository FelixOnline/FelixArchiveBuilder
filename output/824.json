    "content": "Letters\nIn Defence\nof Nigel\nBaker\nDear Bill,\nI am writing to you in response to the article\nin last week's FELIX, entitled 'View from a Bridge', which 'passes judgement' on the Union\nPresident, Nigel Baker. I am not a 'Bakerite', I am on lv writing to point out a few factual\ninaccuracies in the article, and do not want to be\ninvoked in a bickering match between Union\nbig-wigs.\nIn his article Mr Harbour-Bridge says that ' Mr Baker informs his Council of his actions rather\nthan asking their opinion in advance'. This is not\ntrue. At the Council meeting of 21 November\n1988, which I attended, approximately one-and-a half hours were devoted to the President's report. This was because Mr Baker had asked for\nCouncil's views on several matters. These\nincluded rent levels, intercollegiate halls, the\nvalue of sub-wardens, student loans, timetabling,\nto name but a few. The reason for the debate on\neach of these issues was so the President could\npresent the Union's view, and not his personal\nview, at forthcoming committees, meetings and\ndiscussions.\nI seem to remember that last year Mr HarbourBridge presented a paper to the College\nGoverning Body proposing a reorganisation of\nthe College timetabling system. This paper was\nnot presented to Council at the time so the\nproposal put forward was the personal one of Mr Harbour-Bridge. What right does the Union\nPresident have to present personal papers to\nGoverning Dody without first consulting the.\nstudents\u2014those people who elected him and who.\nultimately will be affected?\nI believe that most students would rather see.\nthe Union Office run as an 'efficient package'.\nSurely the more efficient and organised the Union\nOffice is, the more efficient and effective the.\nwhole Student Union will be, which is beneficial.\nto everyone. We should be grateful that the.\nPresident is not continually at loggerheads with,\nhis Deputy. The sabbaticals should work as a. team, with the President, according to the Job.\nDescription instigated by Mr Harbour-Bridge last,\nyear, 'responsible for the overall effective,\norganisation of the Union'.\nOnce the office closes at 5.30pm the President,\nand indeed the other sabbaticals, are still,\naccessible, each one of them having a telephone,\nin their rooms. It is not part of the President's. Job Description to spend every evening in the\nUnion Bar.\nThrough the running last term of Alcohol\nAwareness Week and the Welfare Survey and\nthis term's Aids and Sexuality Week, Mr Baker,\nhas demonstrated that he actually cares about the.\nstudents who elected him. Was it his fault that\n75% of IC students couldn't be bothered to fill,\nin and return the Welfare Survey? Also on the\nsubject of Welfare, the Union does have a Student\nWelfare Officer and the Welfare Committee did\nmeet last term. A Welfare Advisor, a member of\nthe permanent Union staff, has been appointed\nand should be assuming responsibilities any time\nnow. It takes time to appoint the right staff,\nparticularly to the post of something like Welfare\nAdvisor. Indeed in Mr Harbour-Bridge's reorganisation of the Union last year he said that\nthe Union was 'massively understaffed', so when\nstaff are appointed the right choice is essential.\nMr Baker does care about accommodation and\nis currently involved in assessing the value of sub-wardens. The rent levels currently being charged\nfor College halls were agreed during Mr HarbourBridge's year as President, so why didn't he do\nanything about it? And on the subject of the\nmerger with St Mary's, why wasn'ta merger\nagreed last year?\nI believe that the article written by Mr HarbourBridge is a case of 'sour grapes' as a result of\nprobably a few things. Firstly Mr Baker's attempt\nat a vote of no confidence in Mr Harbour-Bridge\nat a Council meeting last term, and secondly Mr Baker is more popular and is doing a better job\nthan Mr Harbour-Bridge ever was or ever did.\nOkay, Mr Baker's 'public image' is not as great\nas Mr Harbour-Bridge's was, but Mr HarbourBridge got his 'public image' through his\n'relationship' with the FELIX Editor. Oh, by the\nway, what did Mr Harbour-Bridge actually do for\nJoe Student during his year as President?\nYours, name not withholding,\nChris Greenwood (Elec Eng 2).\nIndsoc rules\nthe waves\nDear Bill,\nI would like to reply to the anonymous letter\nin last week's issue. Hopefully we can put this\nissue to bed once and for all.\n1. The money in question is not for my benefit,\nit is for Indsoc which doesn't receive an S CC grant.\n2. We were specifically told before the Fair that\nIndsoc would be given a cut of the profits. We\nwere complaining because this was in question.\n3. In four days we raised \u00a3500 for Rag and\n\u00a38,000 for the Union and \u00a32,000 for Indsoc. Very\narrogant I must say.\n4. Why won't you let your name be printed?\nFrightened that somebody else will bitch\nanonymously at you?\nS/ McCall.\nChas for\nWendy\nDear Bill,\nI have just seen an envelope addressed to my\ncolleague Ian Morris, ICU Hon Sec, which has\n. been posted with a first class frank on it. Nothing\nextraordinary about that, except when you\nconsider that it has been posted from College\nitself, instead of being sent in the internal mail.\nAs someone who is responsible for Union\nfinances, Nineteen pence wasted by College may\nseem a trivial amount to quibble over, but I wonder if this is just the tip of the iceberg?\nYours sincerely,\nCharles Brereton ICU Deputy President\nThat's not\ncricket\nDear Editor,\nIam writing concerning the proposed\nexpansion plans for Imperial College Radio,\nwhich 1 note have not been discussed with me.\nOn Friday evening, January 13, I received\nnotice from Sydney Harbour-Bridge that\ncomments and amendments to his suggestions\nshould be received before Wednesday January 18.\nI take this to mean that the last est date for\nsubmission is Tuesday. The notification of this\nleaves me two College days in which to prepare\nsubmissions.\nI suspect it is unlikely to have escaped Mr Harbour-Bridge's notice that this leaves very little\nopportunity for the members of IC Radio to\nformulate a reply to proposals that are universally\nheld by them to be very damaging. Given that\nthe earliest possible time that I could call a general\nmeeting of the station is Thursday January 19,\nI must ask that the deadline be extended.\nFailure to do this will result in the members of\nImperial College Radio being allowed no say in\nthe future of the Club to which they belong. In\nsuch c irc um stane s, many of them are unlikely to\nwish to continue providing a service to their\nfellows.\nAs a consequence of this, and in the light of\nthe unconstitutional discussion of Imperial\nCollege Radio at the last meeting of the\nPublications' Board, I must inform you that\nfailure to extend the deadline will leave me with\nno alternative other than to table a motion of no\nconfidence in the Chairman of the Board.\nYours sincerely,\nNigel Whitfield, Station Manager.\nWendy for\nFELIX\nDear Bill,\nFirst of all may I congratulate you on printing\nthe opinion article by Sydney Harbour-Bridge.\nEven though the article is obviously critical about\nmy bias towards Ents (1 was Ents Secretary last\nyear!), the criticism is constructive and has\nprompted me to act on a number of ideas that\nI had shelved for the time being. I therefore\napologise for not having invested enough time\nin certain areas.\nWith respect to your Editorial, however, I feel\nthat such negative and fruitless criticism will only\nserve to alienate people rather than encourage\nthem to correct any mistakes they may have\nmade. I know that a certain amount of 'them and\nus' inherently exists between FELIX and the\nUnion Office but if we all try to shed our own self-advancement and consider how best to\nproject the Union, progress will be made and the\nstudent populus will see that we're not so\nimmature as to wreck the Union from within\nwhen external influences are having a pretty good\ng \u00b0Yours sincerely,\nIan Morris, ICU Hon Sec.\nPage 2 FELIX January 20 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nCharles Brereton\nAs Deputy President, Chas has\ntaken responsibility for Academic\nAffairs, Overseas Student Welfare,\nfinancial estimates and overseeing\nthe work of the Finance Officer and\nUnion Manager in areas of Bar,\nSnack Bar, Union Building and\nother trading outlets.\nRegarding Academic Affairs, Chas\nwas supremely qualified having\nbeen the Academic Affairs Officer\nand involved in this area for three\nyears previously; even so he\nappears to have been almost totally\nineffectual. It was hoped that by\nsplitting the sabbatical jobs and\nreducing the amount of work to be\ndone by all of them it would allow\nthe s abs to succeed in a few areas\nrather than dabble in a number.\nAcademic Affairs was an area which\ndesperately needed attention and in\nwhich Chas could shine. At the end\nof last year a sabbatical passed Chas\nthe idea that students could be\nmade \u00a355 better off by shuffling\nterm dates and suggested that Chas\nlooked into it. A few months later\nand Chas has achieved nothing;\nluckily Nigel took over the idea and\nresults are now being seen.\nThe College has laid down limits\nfor time-tabled hours of undergraduate courses and although a number of timetables which break\nthese limits have been submitted to\nChas nothing has been done.\nOne of the most important areas\nin Academic Affairs concerns those\nstudents who fail and why. Much discussion has taken place on\nCollege committees about this\nmatter, but no one has any facts to\ngo by. In last year's annual reports\nChas was passed responsibility for\nrunning a non-graduate quest-ion n aire, yet while Nigel has\nmanaged to survey every College\nstudent for Welfare, Chas has not\nbeen able to track down the few\nwho failed and I wonder if he would\nknow what to ask them if he did. In the area of Overseas Students\nChas was passed responsibility for\nthe Third World First student\nscholarship. A large amount of this\nscholarship had already been\nsecured, but some crucial matters\nneeded work. Six months have\nelapsed and Chas would appear to\nhave done nothing. We are now\nreaching the stage where we may\nlose the ground previously gained\nand the programme instigation date\nwill definitely be put back, if it starts\n'Chas Brereton: almost totally ineffectual?'\nat all.\nWhilst the rents in halls of\nresidence were being discussed at\nan important U GM last term, it was\nproposed and eventually passed\nthat Overseas Student fees should\nsub sid is e Hall rents. This is quite\nobviously discrimination against\nOverseas Students, yet Chas\nBrereton's voice was not heard on\nthe matter. The vote was won by\nonly one vote: Chas voted in favour\nof the motion.\nChas's work in the Union Building has been outstandingly bad\nand I shall save much of it for other\narticles, but it is exemplified by the\ncase of the Central Staircase toilets.\nThe toilets were large, underused\nand men only, so an expensive\nalteration programme, to split them\ninto men's and ladies' was started.\nCollege pushed the work through at\nthe most difficult time of the year so\nthat the ladies' would be available\nfor Freshers' Week. Having organised this with help from the\nUnion Manager, Chas failed to\nnotice a lack of towels, paper\ndispensers or soap on either the\nplans or the finished item: these\ntoilets were almost unusable at the\nbeginning of term and, despite\nmany complaints, until approximately two weeks ago.\nIn over viewing the work of the\nUnion Manager the DP must make\nsure that the short term interests of\nthe student are balanced properly\nagainst financial gain so that\nstudents will benefit in the long\nterm. Iwo ud suggest that up until\nnow Chas has failed in this aspect\nfor both the students and the Union,\nbut that's another story.\nFinally, according to his job\ndescription, Chas is responsible for\nsecurity; there has been a new\nsecurity lodge built in the foyer of\nthe Union Building to house a guard\npromised by the College. That lodge\nhas been unfilled for three months\nnow and last week STOIC was\nbroken into at a cost of several\nthousand pounds.\nOn the other hand Chas was the\nonly sabbatical that worked over the\nChristmas vacation, he took office\nearlier than the other s abs and has\ndedicated his year to the Union.\nChas is an extremely amicable and\nfriendly person when he is not on\nhis high horse about being DP and\nI believe he still could do the job\nwell. In his first month or so in office\nhe worked alongside of me and I found him an excellent Deputy\nPresident. Chas does need guidance\n(often away from games machines)\nand advice; his fellow s abs do not\nhave the grounding in the necessary\nareas to help him out at the\nmoment. Nigel Baker does not have\nan understanding of balancing the\ninterests of the students, even if he\ndid run a bar, and Ian Morris has\nnever run a bar. As a team they\ncould manage to fill in all their\ninadequacies. It might mean\nworking after 5.30pm, even when\nthere are not meetings, or on\nweekends, but it definitely means\nworking together, encouraging each\nother and not saying 'that's his job,\nhe's to blame'.\n. Sorry boys but it had to be said.\nPHOENIX IPhoenix is the literary magazine of\nImperial College. It was founded in\n1886 by H.G. Wells under the title\nThe Normal Schools Science Journal\nand now stumbles into its 102nd year with me as newly appointed\neditor. After an experiment last year\nwith a smaller issue published every\nterm, it now returns to its original\nformat of a slim, glossy book\npublished once a year, which I hope\nwill appear during the summer\nterm. As for contents, it's really\ndown to you; poems, prose,\nphotographs, drawings, serious or\nnot so, I am willing to accept\nanything of what I consider a literary nature. One hopes this will\nbe art in the broadest sense of the\nword. You have up until Easter to\ndo something which you can send\nin ( anonymously or under a pseudonym if you wish) via the\npigeonhole in the FELDC Office or to\nme via Chem/Biochem 3 or Linstead\nHall. If you want to discuss\nsomething with me or perhaps are\nmore interested in the production\nside of the magazine I would be only\ntoo happy to talk to you, remember\nyou have nothing to lose.\nR<?y OF\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nARE YOU COLOUR BLIND?\nIf you are, or think you may\nbe, please contact Tony\nMarland or Julie Savage on\nint. 6705 or through the\nBiophysics Department\n(Physics). We desperately\nneed you to help in a simple,\npainless experiment.\nFREE cup of coffee\nto all who join in\nJanuary 20 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

DISTRIBUTION\nA lone figure trundles across the campus. He pushes a shopping\ntrolley before him and looks immensely tired. Stopping, he\nstoops down over his trolley, picks up a heavy pile of paper\nand shambles over to a table. The pile is dropped and the\n. mysterious figure droops back joh i trolley... Who is the figure,\n. and what is he doing?\nWell, it's Bill on a Friday morning. The trolley contains thousands\nof copies of FELIX which are deposited at strategic places for\n. thousands of students to pick up on their way to first lecture. Perhaps\nin future you will realise the effort that goes into producing FELIX\nevery week. You might even want to come down and help! If so,\ndrop in one day; you might even enjoy it...\nSomeone strange\n\n"

The\nprospect of surviving for three\nmonths in this rat race looks bleak\nand terrifying. Yet this is how I and\n3,999 other British students began\nwhat is probably the best experience\nof our lifetimes.\nAs I sailed on the ferry towards\nMartha's Vineyard Island, I really\nbegan to feel the excitement in what\nI was doing. There on the horizon\nlay the silhouette of the Vineyard,\nwhere a new job, a new home and\na whole new circle of friends was\nwaiting.\nThree months earlier I had secured a job in a sandwich/ice\ncream shop. When I walked in there\nfor the first time, I was surprised to\nfind the shop full of British students\nalso working there and after five\nminutes I felt completely at home.\nIt is impossible to describe the\n10V2 weeks I spent on the Island in\na few paragraphs. Students from\nthe whole of New England had\ngone there to work for the summer,\nand the atmosphere was incredible.\nThere were endless parties,\nmidnight swimming trips in the\nlocal lagoon; jeep rides around the\nisland; lying on the golden beaches\njust became a daily duty. It seemed\nas though I was making new friends\nevery day. American students are\nsocial animals and quickly make you\nfeel as though you have known\nthem for years.\nHalf way through my stay, I changed jobs, not because I didn't like the other one, but I wanted to\nhave a different atmosphere. My second job was in an amusement\narcade, and I was the only Brit\nworking there. It meant I really had\na taste of working in America.\nThe end of the American summer\nis marked by Labor Day. The\nsummer work had dried up and it\nwas time for me to set out upon the \u2022\nsecond half of my summer. I had\none month before I had to return to\nEngland, so I bought a thirty day\nGreyhound bus pass, and set out to\nsee America.\nIt is quite impossible to appreciate\nthe size of America when you live -in England. Bus trips of fifteen\nhours, which didn't seem to take\nyou any distance when you looked\nat the map, became the norm. But\neach journey was different and\nnever boring. The largest proportion\nof the Greyhound's clientele\nseemed to be British students, single\nparent families and wi erdo s( the\nlatter being the biggest category).\nI travelled 5,000 miles all together.\nThe highlight of the month was\nStatue of Liberty\nGrand Canyon\ndefinitely the Grand Canyon. The\nsheer proportions are beyond\nimagination (one mile deep, four\nmiles wide at its narrowest point\nand 217 miles long). The scenery is\nbreathtaking, no camera could ever\ncapture the beauty of the painted\nrock set against a clear blue sky.\nAnother place which stands out in\nmy mind, almost as a complete\ncontrast, is Las Vegas. The sight of\nrows and rows of middle aged\nAmericans hypnotically pumping\nquarters into the slot machines is\nboth amusing and sad. The blinding\nneon and glitzy casinos at nighttime\nare replaced by tacky buildings with\noverweight signs during the day.\nDuring my last week I went up to\nCanada, and got a small taste of this\nhuge country. The cities of Toronto\nand Montreal are so vastly different\nfrom their US counterparts, that\nthey could be 1000 miles apart rather\nthan two hours drive. They are\nclean, friendly and safe, and I left\nwith the feeling that I'd like to\nspend a lot more time exploring the\nrest of Canada in the future.\nI would definitely recommend\neverybody to go to America at least\nonce in their lives. But the experience is greatly intensified by\nstaying out there for three months\nworking and is ideal for students. If\nyou would like more information\nwrite to BUN AC,232 Vauxhall\nBridge Road, London.\nText i Chris Shaw Pictures: Jackie Godfrey Page 6 FELIX January 20 1989\n\n"

He added 'It is quite\npossible that ex-staff are coming\nback and using keys to obtain\nequipment from within the Union\nBuilding'. He claimed that there\nwere 'masses' of the keys going\nround and he blamed this on the\nfact that the locks have not been\nchanged since 'before he was born'.\nThe new AS S A6000 keys have\nproved successful so far according\nto Mr Brereton who added 'however, the doors of the Union\nare so bad that if someone wanted\nto enter the building it would be\neasier to knock the doors down rather than touch the lock.'\nThe new keys to the external\ndoors have been issued only to the\nsabbatical officers and the Union\nManager, David Peacock. Chairmen\nof clubs and societies, and other club\nmembers deemed to require a key\nby the Union President will be given\nkeys to their storerooms. Entry to\nthe main Union Building between\nthe hours of 11.30 pm and 6 am will\nbe via the Beit security staff subject\nto clearance by Mr Brereton and\nSherfield security.\nCND talk\nBruce Kent, the former Chairman of\nthe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament will be speaking at\nCollege on Thursday 26th January.\nMr Kent,a former Roman Catholic priest, will be addressing\nImperial College Methodist Society\nin Mech Eng220 at 1pm.' No smoke\nThe Union Snack Bar (now officially\nrenamed the Caterpillar Cafe) has\nbeen designated a non-smoking\narea. '\nOriginally aUG M decision from\nlast year, the smoking ban was also\ndecided upon at a Union Catering\nCommittee Meeting. The meeting\nI also noted a21% drop in lunchtime\nI sales compared to the '87-'88\nseason.\n8 1\n1\nImperial College Union has appointed a new Welfare Adviser,\nYve Posner.\nThe cost of the new appointment\nwill be met by the College and the\nUnion are hoping to persuade the\nCollege to contribute a \u00a37000 annual\nwelfare budget. If this move is\nun succesful the money will be\nraised by cutting back expenditure\non clubs and societies, according to\nUnion President Nigel Baker.\nMs Posner will be able to advise\nstudents on housing benefits and\nlandlord/ tenant relations, as well as\nlegal, consumer and immigration\nproblems. She will also provide\nassistance with letter writing, phone\ncalls and filling in forms. She will be\navailable for consultation from 1pm onwards from Tuesdays to Fridays\nin the Welfare Office in the Union\nBuilding, formerly the Jazz and Rock\nClub.\nForms, leaflets and reference\nbooks will also be available from the\nWelfare Office.\nMs Posner has ten years\nexperience in welfare and benefit\nwork including seven and a half\nyears working for the DHS S, a year\nas leader of the Haringey private\nsector housing benefit team and\neighteen months as a Welfare\nOfficer for Islington Council.\nHigher\nrents\nStudents may lose some of their\nprotection against eviction and may\nhave to pay higher rents as a result\nof the first stage of the 1988 Housing\nAct which came into effect last\nSunday.\nTwo new forms of tenancy\nagreement have been produced:\nlong term 'assured tenancies', and\n'assured short hold tenancies' which\nare for fixed periods, some as short\nas six months. Both increase the\nlandlords' power by allowing the\nlandlord to set rents at 'market\nlevels' and, unlike current contracts,\nto apply to the court for eviction if\nthe terms are broken or if the tenant\nis more than three months in arrears.\nLandlords are also permitted to\ncharge 'key money' for taking up or\nrenewing a contract.\nMost students' landlords are\nexpected to opt for six month\nassured short hold tenancies. These\nwill give the tenants only six months\nguaranteed residence, after which\nthe landlord has the right to evict.\nAny contract entered into before\nlast Sunday will still be covered by\nthe old act. The new regulations are\nonly likely to come into effect when\ncontracts are renewed or new contracts entered into. The tenancies will be administered by\nRent Assessment Committees which have replaced the more\npowerful Fair Rent Office. The\ncommittees have no power over\nnew contracts but they can attempt\nto block excessive rent rises.\ni>V.. m\\ CHAS REDEFINES SMOKING ARE* IN SNACK BAR.\nNOS MOK I WG, Ok!?!

    "content": "Union\nCREDIT IT'S DUE If you are bored or confused by\nthe rhetoric being blasted about on\nstudent loans do not fear, this article\nis designed to inform the majority\nof students as to what is actually\nhappening in the campaign against\nloans.\nFirstly, a few questions have to be\nanswered, the most important being\nwill a campaign against loans\nactually achieve anything? That is,\nonce the DES and the Government\nhave set their minds on the idea is\nthere anything anyone can do to\nstop them. Past cases show there is:\nthe best example being the\nproposed changes in gun Laws after\nthe Micheal Ryan affair. All political\nparties and 80% of the electorate\nwere behind the legislation. But\nthen the Gun Lobby stepped in in\nwhat has become\" one of the most\nnotorious bits of lobbying out: the\nGovernment then dropped the bill.\nThe White paper on student loans\nhardly has the same support to start\nwith.\nSecondly, should we actually try\nto block the white paper? Ignoring\nthe ideological arguments as to\nwhether or not the Government\nought to be committed to fully\nfunding students in higher\neducation or whether alternative\nsources of funding should be found\nfor students, the figures behind the\nwhite paper are based on averages.\nThe average student being male,\nwhite, an undergraduate at a provincial university, whose parents\nhave combined earnings of\nsomewhere in the region of \u00a319000\nand who gets \u00a3214 a year over and\nabove what he should do from his\nparents. He also spends \u00a320.50 a week rent (86/87 prices) and spends\nthe holidays at home. The average\nstudent would not be too adversely\naffected by the proposals in the\nwhite paper except that they'll walk\nout of higher education owing the\ngovernment around \u00a31,600.\nOf course if you're not the average\nstudent (ie you're in London, a woman, a postgraduate, on a part-time course or you receive no parental support) the chances are\nyou would be much worse off under\nthe proposed system. It has been\nsaid that postgraduate grants will\nnot be frozen but post grads will not\nbe entitled to any benefits which\nsort of kicks part-time courses in the\ngoo lies. Naturally I don't have to\npoint out that rents around South\nKensington are not \u00a320.50 on average. From the paper that Ian\nMorris presented to governing body\nlast month (which was based on the\nResearch Service Ltd\" Under graduate Income and Expenditure\nSurvey\", which is what the white\npaper is based on) the average\nLondon student would be \u00a31,510\nworse off(on top of what they would\nowe the Government) at the end of\ntheir course, ie with total debts of\nmore than \u00a33,000 over and above\nthe normal figures now. If you went\nto an institute outside London this\nwould be nearer \u00a31,600 (90/91\nlevels).\nEven if you think loans are the\nbest thing since sliced bread,\nactually reading the white paper\nshows it is a seriously flawed\ndocument (irrespective of its\nideological basis) and should not be\npresented to parliament, this is why\nwe should campaign against it.\nWhat is being done:\nWhat the Union is doing: As has\nalready been mentioned our Hon Sec has submitted a paper to\nGoverning Body about the London\nfactor, in principal this will be\nratified when they have checked\nthat he is not a creative accountant.\nA working party from Governing\nbody will then be set up to decide\nIC policy on the London factor\namong other things. Otherwise the\nUnion is doing what it has been\nmandated to: departments are being\npolled on the proposed half day\nshutdown on the 19th. So far all\nyears polled have said yes to it\n(Geologyl, Life Sci 1, Mech Eng 3\n& 4, Elec Eng 3 & 4, Chem Eng 4,\nMaths 1, Chem1, Physics 3, DOC2 as of 2 pm Tuesday). All departments will have been polled\nby Wednesday. Also on the\nThursday of the 19th the RT. Hon. Peter Brooke, MP for Westminster\nSouth and Chairman of the\nConservative Party will come and..\ngive a short talk followed by questions on his views on loans.\nThis will be at 1pm and Union cards\nwill be needed for entrance.\nA petition is being sent round and\nshould be with your Dep Reps (if\nyou haven't seen it please hassle\nthem). This will be handed into\nParliament on the afternoon of the\nshutdown, so please sign it. Also if\nyou are concerned about the current\nproposals (if yo ii are a first year you\nshould be) write a letter to your own\nMP or the DES and this can be\nhanded in at the same time (meet\nParliament Square 3pm). On the external front, UL U are\norganising a march on the 1st February (the last day of\nsubmissions on the white paper)\nwhich our exec are going on. The\nmarch is from Finsbury Circus in the\nCity (Moorgate tube) to Shorditch\nPark (the centre of the universe, but\nthe only route the police would\nallow the march to go without\ninvoking the public order bill). And if you're really keen we need\nstewards on the day, see me if\nyou're interested. The NUS are\nnationally organising a march on the\n25th of February from Victoria to\nKennington Park where there will\nbe a 'festival' like at the end of the\nanti apartheid march (I reckon we\nought to supply a beer tent). Cooperation with the NUS is running\ninto problems (from their end, UL U have also had some problems with\nthe NUS exec about the 1st of\nFebruary), so no more details are\nknown.\nThe NUS is also trying to organise\na national shutdown on the 16th of\nFebruary and are lia sing with the\nAUT, N UP E etc about it. Our participation in this will probably be\ndecided at the U GM on the 31st. Finally UL U are trying to come up\nwith possible alternative proposals\nto increase access to higher\neducation, which the white paper\ndoes not do. Of course if you get the\ncurrent maximum parental\ncontribution of \u00a34,900 this probably\ndoesn't concern you.\nHal Calamvokis GUC delegate,\nULU FCC.\nOPERA\nAlas Strauss\nand Jones\nOn Monday Griff Rhys Jones made\nhis debut with the Royal Opera at\nCovent Garden Yes, you did read it right....seriously!\nIn distinguished operatic\ncompany the irrepressible Mr Jones\ndelighted a first night audience by\nhis recreation of the comic role of\nFrosch, the jailer, in a production of\nJohann Strauss' popular opera, 'Die\nFledermaus'. The role of Frosch (a speaking only part, I should add!)\nis traditionally taken by a comedian.\nIn England Clive Dunn, Arthur\nEnglish and even Frankie How erd have played the (usually drunken)\ngaol er. However, in this new,\nEnglish version, by writer John\nMortimer (of Rumpole fame), Frosch\nstands on an island of disgruntled\nand holier-than-thou sobriety in a sea of champagne and high jinks.\nThis treatment worked well despite\nobvious first night nerves and those\nof us in the cheapest seats enjoyed\nthe jokes about our 'restricted view'\nof the stage and the unscrupulous\nCovent Garden' Champagne pushers' charging \u00a34 a glass and \u00a325\na bottle.\nPurist concerns that the Viennese\nflavour would be lost in an all\nEnglish interpretation were\noutweighed by some good one-liners in the new translation and\nhilarious use of the controversial\nsubtitles when two imposters were\nspeaking cod French. Of course,\nwhen singing in a language that the\naudience understands, extra effort\nin enunciation is necessary so the\naudience does understand! Generally the diction was good as\nwas the comic riming. Best all round\nwas the wonderful Thomas Allen\n(newly CBE). However, there was\nno weak link in the soloist line up.\nNotably, Claire Powell (Prince\nOrlofsky) managed a difficult part\nwell. The American, Carol Vaness,\nas Rosalinde was definitely a case of\n'She who must be obeyed'. Lillian\nWatson's Adele was as impish as\nshe had been on the Coliseum stage,\nthough not always in tune, but\nDenis O'Ne il was an entertaining\nand convincing Italian (Welsh!)\ntenor both theatrically and vocally.\nIn conclusion, the 'bat's revenge'\nwas an unqualified success and I look forward to seeing it later in the\nrun when it has settled down. By\nnow you should be convinced, so I advise you to get down to the box\noffice in Floral Street.\nRemaining performances: Sat\n21st, Tue 24th. Page 12 FELIX January 20 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Alternative\nmoney money n So you are in your final year now,\neh? What are you going to do afterwards? Don't know? Good,\nyou are just the person who'll make\na good accountant. But I'm afraid\nthat if you started your academic life\nby being sacked from your first\nkindergarten, then please continue\nfilling in those S A F's for engineering firms. In less tactful\ncircles, you'll be known as a kindergarten drop-out.\nYes, sir, this career is for the hi-fliers. That means quite a lot of you,\njudging from the number of\nengineering students going into\naccountancy.\n'So why should I be an accountant?', a clever dick amongst\nyou asks. 'I don't want anything to\ndo with those, Uerggh, yuppies!',\nsays another. Very true. \"They are\nboring'. True. True. 'Counting\nbooks, machines, money or\nwhatever it may be that other\npeople have, is not my idea of a career'. Hmm, you might have a point there. 'What?! Three more\nyears of study. No thanks, I 've had\nenough of three years here'. Alright,\nAlright( will the clever dicks\namongst you shut up so that I can\nget on with my article here?).\nSo there might be a few, how shall\nI put it, setbacks in this. But there\nis one thing that will totally eclipse\nthat viz. Loadsamoney!!\nYep, folks, there's gold in them\nthar' filo faxes. And for those do-good ers out\nthere who might be inclined to\nquestion the ethics and related\nrubbish of this kind, then I'd like to\nquote an authority on moral ethics,\nthat great bastion of capitalism, the\nidols of yuppies (whose name has\ncurrently stepped on a banana skin\nin my brain) 'greed is good'. That\nshould put to rest any moral\nmaelstrom that has ever sprouted in\nyour mind. ( Ah yes! It was Gordon\nGekko.)\nSo how do you go about joining\nthis noble profession? This article\nwill tell you all you need to-know\nand more.\nFirst of all, you've got to decide\nwhich firm to apply to. That, of\ncourse, would be the firm with the\nbiggest salary and benefits. Let us\nsay that it falls to the chartered\naccountancy firm Brown, Brown,\nBrown, Brown & Brown. One thing\none must know is that accountancy\nfirms only take those bozos who are\npassionately interested in joining\nthem so if you do not fall into that\nspecial category of bozos, who know their Ernst & Whinney's from\ntheir Peat Marwick's, then apply to\nthe lot and be passionately\ninterested in joining any firm who\nbothers to call you for an interview.\nThe initial part of the application\nform regarding your personal\nhistory should be easy enough. In\npassing,' I'd just like to point out\nthat it pays to be economical with\nthe truth. I'm not asking anyone to\nlie (shock, gasp, horror!), I'm just\ninitiating you into a few facts of life.\nIf you find yourself unable to\nfinish this portion, with enough\nspice to pale Madras Vindaloo in\ncomparison, then I'm afraid you are,\nas the saying goes, up the spaghetti\njunction without a steering wheel.\nYou might as well crash out now.\nAnd then comes the hard part,\nfilling in those stupid questions,\nalong the lines of 'Why do you want\nto be an accountant', 'What is your\ncareer plan?' etc. Don't despair, the\nmajority of students hit against a blank brain at this point. The correct\nprocedure, or so I'm advised by a friend, is to find out who is the\nliterary buff in your year from the\ndepartmental grapevine. Then you\nhave to pile him with enough free\nbeers/Mars bars ('Investing in the\nfuture') to become mate y. When\nyou feel you have reached the stage\nwhere you and him are a couple of\nreal good pals, like what's his-name\nand who-was-it in the Bible, then\nyou have to delicately introduce him\nto your little problem.

    "content": "THE IVS R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nWith student support a reversal of the scheme may be possible\nIC Union lobby Parliament\nOver 170 Students from Imperial\nattended the Students' Union lobby\nof Parliament yesterday afternoon.\nThe lobby was supported by the\nRector and the College's Governing\nbody and most departments\ncancelled lectures, tutorials and laboratory sessions to enable\nstudents to take part in the action.\nOne MP commended all the\nstudents present as 'well- behaved'\nand saying that he felt the afternoon\nhad been 'carefully organised.'\nBefore the lobby Mr Peter Brooke,\nChairman of the Conservative Party\nand MP for Westminster North,\naddressed the College on the issue\nof student loans expressing the\nGovernment's viewpoint. He argued that the loan system was\njustified, claiming that it reduced the\npressure on parental contributions\nand would increase the number of\nstudents entering higher education\nas a result. He rejected the views of\nseveral students who stated that\nschool-leave rs would be deterred\nfrom entering higher education as\na direct consequence of the loan\nsystem.\nChairman of the meeting, Neil\nMcClusky noted that a survey\ncarried out at Edinburgh University\nconcluded that 40% of school-leave rs would be discouraged from\nentering universities or polytechnics\nunder a loans scheme. Mr Brooke\nfelt this survey was biased by\nstudents' wishes to affect the future\nof the loans scheme. 'Faced with the\nsame questions once the loan\nscheme is in action,' he claimed,\n'they would probably \u2022 vote\ndifferently.'\nThe Government's reference to\nthe Swedish system of loans in its\nWhite Paper was raised by a number\nof students. One student said that\nin a survey carried out by Gothenburg University, 65% of the\ni lowest socio-economic group, who\nI had the relevant qualifications, were\nButcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker\ndeterred from going to university\nbecause of the Swedish loans\nsystem.\nMr Brooke refused to accept\npredictions about the effects a loans\nsystem would have and said 'the\ntest will be in how many people will\ntake up the loans when they are\navailable.' One student commented\n'It is ridiculous to allow our education system to suffer in the\nsame way as the Swedish one before\nwe take any action to remedy the\nsituation.'\nMr Brooke insisted that no\ncondemnation of the system would\nbe fair until it had been tried.\nIt was suggested to Mr Brooke\nthat an increase of 1% in the upper\ntax bracket would 'more than\nprovide for the \u00a3108M needed to\nrestore grants to the 1979 level, in real terms.' Mr Brooke replied that\na large number of people in the\nhigher tax bracket are not graduates\nand as such would object to paying\nfor further education.\nIC Union President, Nigel Baker\nsaid afterwards, 'I thought that the\nmeeting was a success because it\nallowed the students a chance to\nquestion the Government first-hand. I do not think that we\nchanged his mind, but at least we\nhad a go.'\nThe responses from MPs at the\nParliamentary lobby were mixed.\nGraham Riddick, Conservative MP for the Colne Valley, claimed that\nthe implementation of student loans\nwould make students more\nresponsible about entering higher\neducation because they would 'have\nto think about the money first.' He refused to accept one students'\nclaims that loans would discriminate\nagainst students from low-income\nfamilies. He argued that the\nincentive of good jobs after leaving\nuniversity would 'more than\ncompensate' for the expense of the\ncourse. Different views were voiced\nby another Conservative MP, Mr Tony Speller, who implied that the\nconcept of students being seen to be\npaying for further education was a good vote winner among the\nworking classes.\nA number of other Conservative\nMPs were sympathetic to the views\nof students and expressed an interest in modifying the loans-scheme proposal as it stands. Mr Stephen Day, Conservative MP for\nCleesdale, said he would attempt to\nincrease the hardship fund and Mr Richard Page, another Conservative\nMP was particularly sympathetic\nabout the specific problems that\nwould be encountered at Imperial\nand other London colleges.\nMr Page whose son is on a production engineering course at\ncontinued on back page\nISSUE 824 20 JAN 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nA Farewell to democracy \u2022 On Monday, the Union Council will consider a proposal\nto abolish the Union General Meeting. The proposal has been put forward by the\nSt Mary's merger working party. It has to be one of the most absurd and dangerous\nproposals that this Union has ever considered, all the more so because, on the surface,\nthe move appears to quite innocuous.\nThe problem which has been hindering merger between IC Union and St Mary's medical school is the question of the Union General Meeting. The difficulty is that\nthe time table at St Mary's Medical School does not allow their students time to\nattend Union General Meetings at Imperial.\nThe working party's solution to this problem is to abolish UGM's altogether leaving\nCouncil as the only decision making body. Such a move would mark the end of\ndemocracy within the Union.\nThe Union General Meeting is the only forum in which ordinary students possess\nto challenge or question the actions of their elected Union Officers. It is the only\nforum which students have for raising motions on subjects they believe and it is\nthe only forum they have for discussing issues which are important to them.\nWithout UGM's this Union would be governed by a clique of self seeking individuals\nwhose interests lie more in making a name for themselves than in the long term\ngood of the Union. Elected officers would not be accountable to the students who\nelected them and the Union would be one stage further removed from the students\nit represents, as if it isn't far enough removed already.\nIn many ways the abolish ion of UGM's marks the culmination of the attitude which\nhas been pre ve lent throughout the Union this year; a move away from consultation\nand towards decision making behind the closed doors of the Union Office. Take the\nrecently appointed Welfare Adviser for example. Nigel Baker deserves a pat on the\nback for persuading the College to pay for a full time Welfare Adviser. But he was\nwrong not to bring the matter to the attention of Council or the UGM, particularly\nwhen it is possible that cuts in Clubs and Sociecies budgets may be needed to provide\nthe Welfare adviser with the \u00a37000 resource budget she needs to carry out her job.\n(The Union forgot to pass the rel event UFC minutes through the last Council.) No\ndoubt someone will raise the matter at Monday's Council, but now that the adviser\nhas been appointed it is rather too late to discuss the merits or otherwise of having\na full time adviser.\nThe proponents of abolishing the Union General Meeting argue that students will\nstill be able to raise motions at Council and point out that they will be able to ask\nfor speaking rights. They argue that such a system is good enough for The University\nof London Union in their General Union Council (GUC) and so it should be good\nenough for IC.\nThere are two points to bear in mind. Firstly, to be considered by the proposed\nnew council, a motion would have to have 150 second ers, as opposed to our current\nUGM system where only one second er is required. It is fairly obvious that this will\nmake it very difficult for students raise motions at all. Emergency motions, which\nneed to be draught ed and submitted in a hurry will, of course, have no chance\nwhatsoever.\nThe second point is that the GUC consists of delegates representing constituent\nColleges which have there own UGM systems ie the position of GUC is inherently\ndifferent from that of Imperial and St Mary's. Alternatives ? I am not pretending that there will be an easy solution to the UGM\nproblem. It may mean negotiating with the authorities at the Medical School to ask\nthem to reschedule lectures and holding UGM's on alternate sites, for example.\nWhat I do know is that this Union should be striving to become more democratic\nnot less so. Even if retaining UGM's does damage democracy by making it difficult\nfor St Mary's students to attend it is preferable to do this than to destroy democracy\ncompletely by a bol o shing UGM's.

    "content": "The wo d ge of paper you are now holding in a pair of sweaty hands reaches you via the undying (hmmm.. .alm\nenthusiasm of the FELIX staff. A merry band of men (and women), we are led by our illustrious leader,\nGoodwin, FELIX Editor extra ordinaire, in a spacious open-plan office in the corner of Beit Quad.\nI am about to take you on a guided tour of our activities in the FELIX office...\nPrepare yourself for an absolutely mind-blowing experience...\nRESEARCH AND WRITING\nT his is where it all starts... Research is the central activity of\nthe news-team. The team is headed by a man who always has\nhis head in the clouds, Dave Smedley, (a great cloud of fag\nsmoke follows Dave round wherever he goes) backed up by\nSez Wilkinson, Rob Davison, and anyone else close enough to be\nasked to write a news story.\nMuch to the annoyance of various people in College and the Union,\nthese brave souls trek all over the campus to interview notables and\ngenerally be nosey about things that aren't their business. Having\ndug up enough scandal to make a reasonable story, the reporters\nsit at a word-processor and write their various pieces, usually\ncontinuing late into Thursday evening in order to ensure that the\nnews is ' News' and not 'Olds'.\nby Steve Meyfroidt\nPROOFING\nT his step, completely unnecessary most of the time (oh aye, tell\nus another), means per su ad in jy ig rne one to read through the\ntypeset, carefully highlighting^pj|g errors, spelling mistakes,\netc. The text is returned to fl m typesetter operator who\ndiligently weeds out all the mista i as. In fact, this process usually takes two or three cycles to remove\nall the errors, and even then, the odd one manages to slip thru gh. No one's perfect...\nThe nasty camera iI% TYPESETTING\nH and-written or word-processed text needs to be presented in\na final, printed form; the typesetter, a kind of high-powered\ncomputer/laser-printer is used for this. During the week, the\ntypesetter is operated by Rose Atkins, whose delicate fingers\ntickle the keyboard all day long; but when she flits off at 5.30 the\nrest of us are left to grapple with the beast ourselves, which usually\nresults in miles of wasted typeset paper. It's quite fascinating to see\nthe thing set an entire two-page article onto a single line. Fascinating.\nBut completely useless.\nThe typesetter terminal acts in a similar way to a normal word-processor, albeit rather crude in many respects. The clever bit lives\nin another box to which the terminal is attached; it takes a text file,\ncomplete with embedded control codes to determine fonts (type-faces), point sizes (text size is measured in points), and other clever\nthings, and 'prints' it onto photographic film. The film is developed\nin a processor which dunks the film into various chemical baths and\nthen dries it ready for use.\nTHE PROCESS CAMERA\nT he process camera is an essential piece of machinery to the\nproduction of FELIX. And it knows it. That's why it enjoys\nbreaking down or re-programming itself at the most critical\nperiods of activity...\nDuring the final stages of Union Handbook production last summer\nthe thing took it upon itself to collapse before my disbelieving eyes.\nThe first time I'd used it by myself. With 30 or so jobs to get done.\nAnd it decides to blow itself up. D| ve Smedley (the Handbook editor\nat the time) was mildly peeved; not only did he go up the wall, he\nclung to the ceiling and stayed there until the repair-man had been\ntwo. days later.\nAnyway, when it decides to work, the process camera will reduce\nor enlarge artwork, and also produces the 'dot-screened'\nphotographs you see reproduced in FELIX. (Photographs need to\nbe converted into dots before printing; look closely at a 'photo on\nthis page and you'll notice the dots.) As its name suggests, the\ncamera uses photographic methods, although the paper used is\ndeveloped automatically in a processor to give a finished 'photo'\nin about a minute. (The 'photo' is usually called a 'bromide'.)\nThe camera is also used later on in the production process to make\nthe printing plates used by the press see below.\n\n"

It's signatories\nbelieve that freedom could be\ncurtailed in this country, writes\nRobin Davison. Is Britain free from threat to\nliberty? Generations of Britons have\ngrown up expecting to live in one\nof the world's most free countries,\nbut if asked what their civil liberties\nwere they could give no reply. This\nis because we have no written\nconstitution, explaining exactly\nwhat are our rights .\nBritain's Parliament is known as\nthe 'Mother of Democracy', our\nreputation for an impartial and fair\njudiciary second to none, and our\nliberty is the envy of the world. This\nis a prevalent attitude but is\ndangerously complacent according\nto the signatories of the Charter 88.\nThe Charter, calls for civil liberties\nto be guaranteed by a Bill of Rights\non a model that is similar to the one\nwhich exists in America. In the\nUnited States all legislation is tested\nfor un constitutionality by the\nSupreme Court, the equivalent\nbody in Britrain would be the House\nof Lords.\nBritain is unique in\nhaving 300 years of\nParliamentary\ndemocracy\nCharter 88 was launched in conjunction with the New Statesman\nand Society and the Electoral Reform\nSociety. It is endorsed by 250\ncelebrities; these are mostly\njournalists, authors, writers, artists\nand politicans who could be\ndescribed as liberal-left wing intellectuals and are concerned that\nthe period the present Government\nhas been in power has left civil\nliberties undefended.\nThe advantages of a written\nconstitution are that the\n'entrenched' clauses can only be\nchanged by long and protracted\nam mend ment. Any Government in\npower would find it hard to change\nthe document because it would have\nto be passed by an independent\nbody. Their idea is that, like in other\ncountries, the written constitution\nwould have an 'aura of magic'\nwhich would make it sacrosanct.\nThe motives of this group appear\nhonourable, they seem to wish to\npreserve freedom, enhance\ndemocracy and are very liberal and\nEuropean in nature. The disadvantage of a constitutional\nchange of this nature is that changes\nto it can long and protracted. In\nAmerica, for example, equal\nopportunities le glis la tion has not\nbeen introduced, because all 50\nstates have to agree to it. Britain,\nthough not a federal state , could\npass such laws in one Parliamentary\nterm.\nHow has Britains' unwritten\nconst it ion come into being ? We are\nunique in Britain in having had 300\nyears of parliamentary democracy in\nwhich the network of laws that\npreserve our liberty have been\nformulated. It is from the 'Glorious\nRevolution ' of 1688 that the\nprinciples of a democratic monarchy\nhave been estalished, but the\nsignatories of the charter claim that\npower of the monarchy was only\nshifted from the hands of an absolute monarch to a parliamentary\noli garth y. They assert that Britain\nhas a long history of freedom\ndocuments, for example the Magna\nCarta, signed by King John and the\npeoples' charter of 1838.\nCritics, have claimed that by\nape ing the name of the Charter 77\nmovement in Czechoslovakia, a freedom and civil rights Covenant\nthe written\nconstitution would\nhave an 'aura of\nmagic'\nthe signatories do no justice to their\ncase. Conditions here are so much\nbetter than in the Eastern Block so\nas not bare comparison.\nThe Independent newspaper in an\neditorial proposed that the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights could be incorporated into\nthe legislature. This would be a shortcut to achieving the same\nobjective. The European Convention was drawn up after the\nSecond World War in a manner\nsuch as to be acceptable to the 21\nmembers of the Council of Europe.\nIt has several 'let-out' clauses that\nwould make it more acceptable to\ngovernment, for example,\ninterference with the exercise of a right can be sanctioned, ' in the\ninterests of national security, public\nsafety or the economic well being of\nthe country '.\nThe Charter also expresses the\nneed for electoral reform to a system\nof proportional representation and\nin doing so has only recieved warm\nsupport from the Labour Party.\nRoy Hattersley, Labours deputy\nleader, writing in the Guardian\nclaims that Charter 88 diminishes\nthe importance of positive aspects\nof freedom. He claims, focusing\nattention on loss of freedoms, that\nstate interference of civil rights is not\nenough, for example, the right to a basic 'living' wage. He cites TH Green who defined freedom as 'a positive power or capacity of doing\nor enjoying something worth doing\nor enjoying'. Green was discussing\nthe Irish Land Act last century that\nprevented landlords and tenants\nfreely signing agreements in which\nthey were usually ruthlessly\nexploited. However the charter has\ngenerally received cross-party\nsupport.\nThe New Statesman and Society\ndocuments 88 cases where they\nbelieve individual freedoms have\nbeen lost in the last 100 years. The\nBritain has a long\nhistory of freedom\ndocuments\nmost recent of which is the loss of\nthe 'right to silence' in Northern\nIreland's trials, but others just from\n1988 include the ban of interviews\nof paramilitary supporters on radio\nand television.\nThe supporters of Charter 88 do\nnot believe that their demands will\nbe met immediately they consider\nthat change of this magnitude\nwould take over 25 years to\ncomplete, however the discussion of\nHuman Rights is their immediate\nobjective. Perhaps it should be\nremembered that few people ever\nmiss their liberty until it is taken\naway from them.\nJanuary 20 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
