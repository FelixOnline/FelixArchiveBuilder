    "content": "Clubs & Societies Felix 928 28 February 1992\nOutdoor\nThe year for S+G, the Outdoor\nClub, started last summer in the\nDauphine Alps of southern France,\nwhere for three weeks fifteen of us\nmade our home in the high Alpine\nvalleys of Les Ecrins National Park.\nFrom there we ventured onto the\nmountains and, experienced and\ninexperienced alike, soon found\nourselves tackling the big summits.\nThe first success was on climbing\nmeant breathtaking scenery, dawns\nand sunsets, and the magical\ntranquillity of the mountains.\nThe mountain bikers in the group\ntended to venture further afield,,\nsometimes for several days over the\nhigh mountain passes, but not to be\noutdone they also managed an\nascent of the 3000 metre LA Blanche, in places 'using the bikes\nas ice axes'.\n.. Climbing\nalways meant\nbreathtaking\nscenery, dawns\nand sunsets...'\nInsanity\nthe 4000+ metre Barre des Ecrins,\nthe highest peak in the region.\nFrom our bivouac on the Glacier\nBlanc five of us set out before dawn\nto follow the glacier to the foot of\nthe main climb while the snow pack was still firm and crisp. From there\na vertical kilometre of steep snow\nslope stretched above us. We had\nto make a quick and direct ascent\nbefore the heat of the day allowed\nthe snow to soften too far, and after\nlong hours of climbing managed to\nreach the summit early on a glorious\nafternoon.\nLater, successful attempts were\nalso made on such notable peaks as\nPelvous (climbed by night by\nCoolidge Couloir), the spectacular\nlone spire of Aiguille Dibona whose\nsummit could only accommodate\none person, and beautiful Les Bans.\nHowever the difficulty of mountains\nwas considerable, and on some\noccasions this together with the\nsevere Alpine storms meant\nabandoning hopes for the summit.\nNevertheless, climbing always\nOn dates off from climbing we\nvisited the local towns and villages\nand also found time for a bit of\nskiing at the resort of Les Deux\nAlpes. These respites were\nparticularly appreciative by Clive'Do you think I'm some sort of\nhardship freak or something?'.\nDuring it all, however, it only\noccurred to our chairman that all the\nsnow could be put to a much better\nuse; a snowball fight! By all\naccounts it was an epic Summer\nTour, and even after most of us had\nreturned to England the\nirrepressible Martin, Phil and\nRichard continued on to Chamonix\nfrom where they climbed Mont\nBlanc.\nHowever, all was not hard work\nlast summer. The clubs weekends\naround this country provided the\nperfect antidote to Alpine climbing;\nin Dartmoor it was the cream teas\nat the end of a days walk and in the\nLake District the same was\nprovided by the sailing on Lake\nWindermere on hot afternoons.\nThe start of the college year in\nOctober also saw trips to the Peak\nDistrict of Derbyshire and the\nBrecon Beacons, where between\nrock climbing or trying to walk in\n50mph winds, the club members\nrediscovered their enthusiasm for\ngoing into caves. On the third\nweekend trip of the term to the Lake\nDistrict we encountered to our,\nsurprises the first, and only major\nsnowfall of the winter.\nThis was used to full advantage\nby all those eager to do some snow\nand ice (and waterfall) climbing, on\nboth Bow Fell and Great End, and\nby all those who fancied another\ngood snowball fight. Liz, Colin,\nGlen and Stuart - the mad mountain\nbikers - also turned a few heads by\nworking their way over snow and\nice to the top of Skiddaw and\nHellyvelyn, and their determination\nwas rewarded by allowing them to\nvirtually ski the decent s. The clubs final trip of last term\nwas to Snowdonia. Although we\nwere not as lucky with the snow, the\nweather still obliged; starting out in\ndrizzle, we soon found ourselves in\nbrilliant sunshine as we gained\nheight on the mountains, above a sea of clouds with only the tops of\nthe highest mountains being visible.\nIt was one of the most stunning\nviews any of us had ever seen.\nAfter the end of term Christmas\nfestivities, the club set off on its\nweek long winter tour to Glen Etive\nin Scotland. Those who are familiar\nwith the Highlands in winter will\nknow that it is only for the hardiest,\nand this year we were washed out\nby torrents of rain and the floods\nthey brought. Nevertheless,\nclimbers and bikers still braved the\nelements and the hangovers to enjoy\ndays on such impressive mountains\nas Buchaille Etive Mor. Honours go\nto those who climbed Ben Nevis in\natrocious conditions; Oli and Rupert\nvia a snow climb, and Colin on his\nicicle beset mountain bike.\nThe club is now half way through\nthis terms activities, and we've\nalready had two more trips to the\nLake District and one more to\nSnowdonia. These saw the\nre emergence of bivouacking, for\nthose eager, but sleeping suspended\nby a harness hundreds of metres up\na rock face is not everyones idea of\na good time. Most opted instead for\nthe traditional retiring to the warmth\nof the local pub in the evenings.\nAmongst other things planned for\nthe rest of this term is a barging\nweekend on some of the Midlands\ncanals, and the clubs week long\nEaster Tour to the Isle of Skye.\nDuring the summer term we'll also\nhave another weekend in the Peak\nDistrict and one to Cornwall after\nthe exams, agreed to be probably\nthe best of the year.\n\u2014 2 2 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion Felix 928 28 February 1992\nI 'll just like a moment of your\ntime to share something rather\nspecial with you. It's a little about\neverything, life, computers, ice-creams, sex etc. and in particular\nyou.\nBefore I go on, I want to\nintroduce an interesting concept,\ncalled 'Quality'. 'Quality' is\nundefinable. We can understand\n'Quality' in how it manifests or\nshows itself but not why it does so.\nIt's probably a little vague at the\nmoment, but if you'll bear with me,\nit'll clear up soon enough.\nQuality manifests itself in many\nforms, one of them crops up in the\narts, when I ask you why you like\nthat allows them to come together\nand form the inanimate.\nInanimate objects have another\nQuality that allows them to come\ntogether to form life.\nBiological organisms group'\ntogether with another Quality to\nform a society.\nIn order for societies to interact,\nanother Quality creates the intellect.\nThe final Quality is one that\nallows intellects to be groups\ntogether. Artistic Quality is an\nintegrating or uniting factor\nbetween the hierarchical levels.\nQuality gives rise to everything.\n(See diagram 1)\nThe Qualities found between the\nQuality not Quantity\nLife, the\nUniverse and\nEverything.\nHoward Lee\nlooks into the\nindefinable\nquality of\nQuality.\nsomething, you'll probably reply\nbecause it looks good, but why? It's simply because it feels so. What I'm talking about is artistic Quality. It's there but you can't define it.\nAlthough there are some principles\nthat determine what good art is,\nthey aren't enough to turn us into\nVan Goghs or Rembrandts.\nLet me show you another\nexample, we all know that all matter\nis held together by electrostatic\nforces, i.e. positive and negative\ncharges. Unlike charges attract and\nlike repels, but why is this so? We\nall know how it works but we don't know why. Quality again. Break\nany concept down far enough and\nyou'll have Quality staring at you.\nParticles have a certain Quality\nbiological and social levels and\nonwards in the evolution are 'Mind\nQualities' whereas the ones below\nare 'Matter Qualities'. In our field\nof knowledge, quantum physics and\nbiochemistry are the closest fields\nto their corresponding Qualities.\n(See diagram 2).\nScience asks why certain things\noccur, and for a while it can go on\nexplaining why, but sooner or later\nit'll hit Quality and it's stumped.\nEven if someone could explain why\nunlike charges attract, then his\nreasons must be explained too\nand...\nThe realm of Quality is just like\na big black hole that defeats human\ncomprehension. Defining it would\nalways make it less than what it is.\nMind and matter are related.\nThey both have the same common\ndenominator, Quality. They aren't separate entities, although our\nintellect can function without\nknowing how the inanimate is\ncreated or why the inanimate is\ncreated. Each level in the hierarchy\nfunctions like a virtual machine.\nJust like a computer programmer\nneeds only to know how a program\nworks not how it's created much\nless what an np n transistor is, to live\nin a society, we only need to know\nits rules and laws.\nAt each level within this\nhierarchy, there exists varying\ndegrees of evolution of that level.\nThere are high Quality biological\norganisms and low Quality ones.\nEverything that Quality creates has\nitself Quality, sort of like the\nMandelbrot set analogy. Someone\nlike Leonardo Da Vinci had a pretty\nhigh Quality mind, not just\nintelligence Quality but artistic\nQuality as well. Similarly, at the\nsociety level, something is\nconsidered right or good if it has\nhigh Quality. The fact that the\nproblem of society has not yet been\nsatisfactorily resolved is due to the,\nlack of context. You cannot come\nto a conclusion of what's acceptable\nif you don't know where you stand.\nSort of like a dog chasing its tail.\nIt goes round and round and round\nand finally stops from\ndizziness...back to square one.\nSince Quality has given rise to these\nvalues, then we can see that the\nhierarchy evolution of Quality has\nprecedence in determining rights\nand wrongs.\nA doctor, in order to save a patient has to kill the germs in the\npatient. The patient wants to live,\nthe germ wants to live but the\nperson is at a higher biological state\nof evolution that the germ.\nIf a person isn't putting others at\nrisk then society has no right to kill\nhim because the intellect is at a higher level of evolution than\nsociety.\nIn everything, there exists a static\nand dynamic factor. Imagine this\nperson who did everything society\nexpected, followed all the laws, was\nvery moral and ethical. This is\nessentially a very static person. But\none day, a sudden spark hits him (or\nher or whatever) and he didn't like\nsomething about society. So there\nhe goes creating a huge upheaval.\nFor a while society's standards just\ncondemns him, but what if people\nbegan to see his point of view and\nalso liked what he was making all\nthe fuss about. So he becomes some\nrevolutionary leader and changes\nsociety's outlook. It's never as\nsimple as this but that's the\nprinciple.\nWhat keeps us from reverting'\n-10-\n"

However we were\nsomewhat concerned and perplexed\nby the photographs used in support\nof the articles particularly the one\nwhich appeared beneath the heading\n'The Terrence Higgins Trust'.

This action was\nunjustified and uncalled for.\nHowever...\nI find it difficult to have much\nrespect for any publication that will\nprint, in the fashion of the tabloid\nor gutter press, an article which\ncontains so much that is not even\nmisinformed fact, but sheer fiction.\nI refer of course to Steve\nNewhouse's 'Grease Review', a man who by his own admission had\nnever seen a show on this scale in\nrehearsal, or on the stage at this\ncollege! Surely then not the most\nqualified writer to report on a show\nthat for a few weeks united Opsoc,\nrce ny Dramsoc, Imperial College Union,\nCity & Guilds Union, Royal School\nof Mines Union, Royal College of\nScience Union, Conference Office,\nSherfield Safety, Security and the\nHolland Club amongst others.\nAgreed, the first night was rough\naround the edges, as may be\nexpected, but after that I found little\ntruth in the article in question. The\nmost notable 'mistake' being the\nquote T found myself wondering\nwhere \u00a38,000 of Imperial College\nmoney had gone', I can tell you\nnow that at no time was \u00a38,000 of\nImperial College Union (ICU)\nmoney likely to go anywhere as\nthey had only sub sidi sed the show\nto \u00a31,000 (including Opsoc and\nDramsoc show budgets), as had the\nRector. The rest of the \u00a38,000 show\nbudget was underwritten by a Libellous piece of Journalism\nDear Adam,\nWho was responsible for the\nlibellous piece of journalism\naccompanying the UL U football\nleague tables in FELIX, issue 927?\nI took the effort to get the UL U tables to you, and in return I did not\nexpect some 'journalist' to write\ncynical, incorrect and down-right\nbad mannered rubbish about\nImperial's six mens football teams.\nI would like to take this\nopportunity to put the record\nstraight.\n1. What is being implied by\nwriting:\nTC4th's are in danger of being\npromoted to Division 3 (where they\nshould be in the first place).'?\nIt is a great achievement to gain\npromotion, and certainly a credit to\nthe college for an Imperial team to\ndo so. It should not be described as\ndangerous! As regards what\ndivision the 4th team should play in,\nI have been through the football\nclub archives, which go back to\n1984, and found that IC4th's have\nalways played in Division 4 making\nthe possible promotion even more\nimpressive an achievement. It is, in\nfact, the 5th and 6th teams who are\nplaying in a division 'too high',\nwhich is due to the past effort of\nthose two teams, earning\nthemselves promotion within the\nlast three years.\n2. I read that:\nTC 2nd's have an outside chance\nof winning Division Two'.\nIn the football club we consider\nit a very outside chance, partially\ndue to the fact that IC 2nd's play\nin Division One!\n3. It is nonsensical to write:\n'...propping up 4th place...'\nTeams prop up bottom places in\na division, not top ones. Our 1st and\n3rd teams do not deserve this\nwording after working especially\nhard to achieve places near the top\nof their respective divisions this\nyear.\n4. My biggest bone of contention\nregards the end comment:\n'What more can you expect from\nsuch a pathetic lot?'\nPerhaps this was supposed to be\nsome sort of joke\u2014well it wasn't very funny.\nIt isn't just Felix staff who put a great deal of work into the\nsuccessful running of their club, I think we could all do without these\ncheap, negative jibes.\nBefore the author accuses us, the\nfootballers, of being pathetic would\nhe (or she\u2014we also have a very\nsuccessful ladies team) like to bring\nhis/her boots along any Wednesday\nor Saturday and find out for\nthemselves how pathetic Imperial\n2 \u2014\nfootball is.\nI would like to end by saying that,\nif we had wanted 16 lines of\nfallacies to accompany the tables,\nwe would have provided them\nourselves. If, in future, you write\na piece about the football club,\nplease have the decency to ask me\nfor the accurate details\u2014I am\navailable in the Union every\nlunchtime for football club\nbusiness.\nIn conclusion, after reading the\narticle and noting that Felix Francis,\nof Imperial, is currently captaining\nthe University of London football\nteam, we in the football club are of\nthe opinion that our Felix is better\nthan yours!\nYours,\nDavid Buckle, Club Captain,\nImperial College Association\nFootball Club.\n\n"

The article\nsuggested a number of factors\nwhich led to high stress levels.\nThese included living in a big city,\nworries about money, difficulties\nwith accommodation, high work\nloads, and an uneven ratio between\nmen and women. The conclusion\nwas that a fair description of\nImperial College was 'stress city'.\nPerhaps above all, the article\n(Sherfield Ante-Room, between the\nlifts and the dining room on the\nground floor).

    "content": "28 February 1992 Felix 928 Opinion\nback to our primeval ancestors is\nthis static factor. The thing that\ncauses it to change is the dynamic\nfactor. The dynamic factor is just\nsomething that arises, weld by\nQuality. We all can sense this\nQuality, when someone does\nsomething, whether it's high or low\nQuality even if it may contradict\nsociety's laws. If we support it, then\nwe can enforce change. Good and\nbad are relative until something\nbetter comes along. Although they\nmay be arbitrary values, Quality\ndoes keep a sharp eye on it. To say\nthat killing and murdering should be\ndecreed legal by a society is pretty\nmuch nonsense because it goes\nagainst the evolution of Quality. To\nhold a society together, the\ninhabitants won't be allowed to\ndestroy themselves voluntarily.\nA dynamic advance is pretty\npointless unless it can find some\nstatic pattern with which to protect\nitself from degeneration back to the\nconditions that existed before the\nadvance was made. Evolution isn'ta continuous forward motion, it\nprogresses in ratchet like steps.\nSome dynamic patterns simply\naren't good enough to form latches.\nDNA is essentially static\ninformation but the shift in cell\nreproduction from mitosis to\nmeiosis to permit sexual choice\nallows huge DNA diversification,\na dynamic advance.\nIf someone were to come up with\na proposition that may be nothing\nexists, may be everything is in the\nmind and you can't deny it because\nno one knows the absolute truth;\njust what would you say'.'....Well,\nin Quality's context, Quality has its\nown view and this person has his\nown view. Both views are presented\nto the public. It would be a pretty\ngood bet that Quality's view would\nscore higher on the chart than\n'everything's in the mind'. We're\nnot talking about right and wrong\nhere, Quality simply decides which\nis better, we all decide which is\nbetter, and it'll be something we\naccept until a better Quality\napproach comes up.\nNow, if you'll take a moment to\nreflect: just what am I?I am not just\nthe intellect, not just society\ninstincts. What do you think\nemotions are? Love, sexual desire.\nInanimate\nBiological\nSocial\nIntellectual\nhate. They are biological Qualities\nthat affect the mind. Sex is a very\nhigh biological Quality, make no\ndoubt about that. Hate is a pretty\nlow one. Killing is wrong...society\ninstinct. All these Qualities make\nus. All our experiences shaped us.\nWe are really a manifestation of our\nenvironment. What arises conflicts\nis the clash between values of the\nhierarchical levels, when the mind\nis divided against itself. Society\ndoesn't approve of sex much. It's tolerated but it scores pretty low on\nits Quality chart. It's become a lot\nmore liberal on the subject now but\nin some cultures it's still a big no\nno. However, as long as we can see\nthe context, then we should be able\nto deal with it. If society can't tolerate it but biologically it's pretty\ngood then it should be kept at a personal level. What's more to say?\nMaybe one day casual sex would be\nacceptable morally in society but\nQuality\nQuality\nua\nbiological organisms sometimes\ntend to be quite possessive of their\npartners.\nWe're all looking for something\nin life and the answers are to be\nfound in ourselves. Quality's outlook is a whole new perspective\nto everything, it unites science and\nthe arts, mind and matter, subject\nand object, life and the universe.\nThere's just one last example that\nyou should think about. Imagine\nthis person who tried to do\neverything right. What if life\nsuddenly took a plunge, and\neverything just became worse and\nworse. To lose everything and find\nout there's still something else to\nlose.\nLife is one big downpour. I don't think this person could help but\nthink 'Why has God forsaken me?\nI 've been good, why are all these\nthings happening?'. You see our\nconcept of absolute good and evil,\neven how right it seems doesn't always fit into reality. For a lot of\npeople, when reality shatters all\ntheir beliefs, they are drawn very\nclose to insanity and atheism. Now,\nsay if this person still had faith in\nGod but also had the Quality\noutlook. Even how bad everything\ngets, it's just life, it's just one of\nthose miserable things. Mentally,\nthis person would be stable but\ndepressed. I think this individual's faith in God would strengthen under\n1 \u2014\nthese conditions. At this point I think if people could see the\ncourage, the environment can turn\naround to help. Whatever it is, the\nlater approach is better than ending\nup with a mental breakdown. This\nhypothetical person isn't so\nimaginary at all. There's always a bit of him or her in all of us. life\njust isn't always a sweet double\nfudge chocolate sundae. Quality\nisn'ta belief, it's a way of seeing.\nThe question of what initially\ngave rise to Quality and where it's Matter\nMind\nheading relates to our concept of\nGod and the absolute truth. The fact\nthat we can't define Quality makes\nit pretty meaningless trying to say\nwhat God or the absolute truth is.\nThe Quality that can be defined is\nnot the Quality. The God that can\nbe defined is not the God. The\nabsolute truth that can be defined is\nnot the absolute truth. If something\ndid create Quality and if it is\nheading some direction then follow\nQuality, that's the best thing we've\ngot...it created us, no doubt about\nthat, it created the universe, it keeps\nus alive and in turn we can give rise\nto Quality.\nWe're all but a grain of sand on\nan endless beach, each unique and\nspecial, taking and endless time to\ndescribe. I was never born and will\nnever die. When the time comes to\ndepart, I am like a snowflake\ndissolving in air...\n'Nobody would deny that\nphenomena determines the\ntheoretical system despite the fact\nthat there is no theoretical bridge\nbetween phenomena and their\nprinciples.. .There is no logical path\nto these principles, only intuition,\nresting on sympathetic-understanding of experience, can\nwe reach them...'\n\u2014Albert Einstein.\n(Adapted from 'Lila' by Robert\nPirsig, a truly remarkable genius.)\nHoward Lee (ISE1).\nA, Inanimate\nElectrostatic forces,\nchemical bonding.\nBiological\nDNA, proteins.\n/ R\\' Socia\n1- -t Moral codes, ethics;\ngives rise to communication.\nIntellectual\nDemocracy, freedom of speech;\n-in order to relate\ncommunication, intelligence.\n\u2014 1\n\n"

He looks after the\nBar, Bookshop & Catering and\nchairs the Union Finance\nCommittee which decides, amongst\nother things, how much money\nclubs are allocated.\nI won't give you all the lies about\nwhat a wonderful hedonistic Utopia\nthe Union will be if you vote for\nme. I just promise to do my best\nJohn St-Hill (Maths 3rd Year\nex RCS Vice-President) on Phil\nSharp\nI have known Phil for 3 years as\na friend and member of ICRAG.\nThrough out that time he has always\nbeen a mature and responsible if\nsomewhat strange individual.\nSecurity & Discipline :-Phil has\noften shown himself to be a responsible individual with good\norganisational ability. This,\ntogether with his understanding and\napproachable nature will bring a human side to ICU discipline.\nMascotry :-Phil has played an\nactive part in RCS mascot ry over\nthe last three years.\nFinance & Management :-Phil is\noften involved in financial side of\nRag and assisted Laurie and myself\non numerous occasions counting\nand banking money.\nPhil has always been a trusted and\nsupportive friend. I believe that his\nskills and natural ability together\nwith his easy-going sense of\nhumour would make him an\nexcellent candidate for Deputy\nPresident and I urge you to vote for\nhim.\nHON SEC (EVENTS) Nick Allen proposed by Laurie McNamee\nDuring my time at Imperial I have\nthrown myself into college life. I am an ex-Royal College of Science\nUnion Honorary Junior Treasurer\nand edited Broadsheet, the RCS\nnewspaper, in my first year as well\nas the RCS handbook. I have also\nbeen heavily involved in IC Rag,\nbeing one of only four members of\nthe \u00a31000 club last year. I am\nprincipal cellist with Imperial\nCollege Symphony Orchestra, and\nam at present organising their\nforthcoming tour to Hungary.\nThe job of Hon Sec is a disparate\none. It includes responsibility for\nRag, Entertainments, room\nbookings, as well as\nCommemoration Ball, Freshers\nFair and the sabbatical work split.\nI am not going to sit here making\nrash election promises. I will do the\njob to the best of my ability as\ndefined by the constitution to ensure\na smooth ride for all IC and Mary's students. However, my ideas for the\ninclusion of innovation into the\nUnion include:\n-Trying to get a better Ents\nlicence to encourage bigger names\nto IC, and promote more up and\ncoming acts.\n-With the forthcoming\nrefurbishment of the concert hall,\nshowing films twice a week with the\nco-operation of Film Soc and ICSF.\n-Promoting bar and snack bar\nfacilities over the Summer vacation.\nThis will have obvious benefits for\nstudents and post grads present over\nthe summer.\n-Increased use of the union as a hire able venue.\n-Investigating the possibility of\ncomputer ising room booking,\nstreamlining the service for clubs\nand societies.\n-Investigating the possibility of\nemploying a full time ents officer.\nThis is not a slur on Ents, but an\nattempt to increase the already very\nprofessional nature in which ICU is\nrun.\nI feel my experience makes me\nwell suited to the post of Hon Sec.\nVote for me.\n\u2014 1 5 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "28 February 1992 Felix 928 Feature\nDawn broke gently over the\nsprawling city of Damascus and the\ncars began to prick the fresh pink\nmorning with their tinny horns.\nOn the eighth floor of a grimy\nhotel just off of Martyrs Square I was sleeping peacefully. The fan\nhummed quietly and the cool air\nmade the curtains billow across the\nopen window.\nThe muezzin from a nearby\nmosque began the call to prayer and\nhis words floated mournfully\nthrough the quiet streets. One by\none other voices joined in until the\nmorning sky became a haunting\ntable of exultation.\nI opened a reluctant eye to look\nat my watch, not wanting to dispel\nthe fleeting world of semi-sleep that\nI was currently revelling in. It was\na little after 5.00am. Slowly I became aware of another\npresence in the room, something\nwas moving around. A scratching\nnoise came from the other bed, over\nwhich my luggage was strewn. I opened my eyes and half sat up. The\nconfronted by a bearded man in his\ntwenties wearing jeans and at shirt.\nAcross his chest he held a Kalashnikov assault rifle. I stood in\nfront of him feeling a little\nnonplussed. He pushed me out of\nthe way with a helpful shove from\nthe butt of his AK47.\nHalf asleep as I was, it suddenly\ndawned on me what he wanted.\nObviously he had come to shoot the\neat.\nAt 5.00am, having just been\nrudely awoken it seemed perfectly\nreasonable to me that any thoughtful\nhotel manager worth his salt would\nregularly send round young men\narmed with machine guns to check\nfor stray cats. I began to say 'No\nreally. It's ok, the cat wasn't any\ntrouble, you mustn't shoot...'\nPeter Wright\nmeets a cat and\ncrosses the\nHooghly river in\nhis travels to...\nDamascus\nCalcutta\ncat that had been clawing my newly\ncleaned trousers froze like a statue,\nglaring at me with frantic eyes.\n1 barely had time to register what\nwas happening when, without\nwarning, the cat leapt straight\nthrough the open window. It didn't even touch the frame.\nI laye d back on my bed and tried\nto remember whether or not there\nwas a balcony outside. Secondslater, as I was slipping back into the\ncosy arms of sleep, there was a sharp hammering at the door. I swore and got fog gil y out of bed.\nThe hammering got louder. When\n1 eventually got the door open I was\nMy voice trail led off as he started\ngoing through my bags with one\nhand. The other hand was on his\ntrigger. I stood in my boxer shorts\nand watched.\nWhen he had finished he walked\nstraight to the door and without\nlooking at me just said 'Police'. He\nclosed the door and I heard his\nfootsteps echo down the hallway.\n,' -I scratched my head, walked over\nto the window and lean t out. Eight\nfloors below an old man was talking\nto a taxi driver as he tried to get a dead cat off of the roof of his\npavement stall. There wasn'ta balcony after all.\nMy first memory of Calcutta after\nleaving Howrah Station was\nwalking over the huge Howrah\nBridge which spans the Hooghly\nRiver.\nThe bridge is a squat construction\nof girders that hangs over the river\nin a grey fog of its own pollution.\nCars, buses and lorries thunder over\nit tangled up in the screams of their\nown horns and the wailing of their\nown engines. From a distance it\ncould almost be condensing from\nthe vicious gut of cloud around it.\nA slow accretion of waste, both\nmaterial and human.\nThe sidewalks were black\ntarmac, dusty and spattered with big\nclots of mucus that lay like open\noysters. I stepped over beggars who\nhad no limbs, just lay on\nnewspapers, not even bothering to\nbeg anymore. Slowly they are\nbecoming a part of the bridge, their\nskins are turning the same shade of\ngrey as the girders that they slump\nagainst. They are petrifying under\nlayers of poison, fossil ising, turning\ninto gargoyles.\nPeople bumped into me and\ndidn't notice, they bumped into\neach other, trod on beggars, spat on\nthe road, pissed on the pavement.\nPorters ran backwards and forwards\nwith huge loads on their heads,\nsweating. Their sandals clicked like\nticking clocks. They swore, pushed\npeople out of the way, raced each\nother and then were gone,\nswallowed in the noise and dust that\nbound itself around them like twine.\nHalfway over the bridge, a man\nstood silent and motionless, not\neven blinking in the hellish\nconfusion. People jostled all around\nbut he didn't move, he just stood\nand stared out across the Hooghly.\nHis rags flapped in the thick wind\nand the foot-long thread of mucus\nthat hung from his nose swung like\na pendulum. He just stood and\nstared. He was an empty shell, like\nhe was made of sand. I felt that I could flick him and he would\ncrumble away into nothing. He\nwatched the hazy buildings\ncompressed by the heavy brown\nsky. He watched the Hooghly run\nunder him, textured like vomit and\nall the while there was nothing in\nhis eyes. They were an absence, the\nemotion of loss. They were as\nhollow and empty as the space left\nby a missing child.\nIn a second he had disappeared\nbehind me amongst the swallowing\ntides of people and I was swept on\ntowards the waiting city.\nAs I stepped out from the stifling\nframework of the bridge the\natmosphere began to thin slightly.\nThe metallic greys drifted into the\nmalignant browns and yellows of\nendless lines of buildings. They\nstood in uneven rows like rotting\nteeth. Cars and buses flowed around\nthem in angry currents that snarled\nand fought with serpentine frenzy.\nIn front of me a man blocked the\nnarrow path as he lean t against a wall and urinated. As he finished a taxi pulled up alongside me and the\ndriver wound down the window.\n'Welcome to Calcutta, I take you\nsomewhere nice. T looked at the\nscene around me and doubted that\nvery much indeed.\n\u2014 9 \u2014\n\n"

I soon moved away.\nCall the fashion police.\nBoo Hewerdine, tonight's support act, promoting his new\nalbum Ignorance, has a nice\nacoustic guitar sound, and an\namusing line in inter song banter.\nSiobhan Maher, lead singer of\nRiver City People has no such gift\nof the gab, but her voice is stunning\nwhen singing, particularly to an\nacoustic version of Carry The\nBlame in the encore. Her coat is\nquite nice too, in agree ny, velvety\nsort of way. She's certainly got\nsomething though, as her band seem\nto have been multiplying over the\npast six months. There were six of\nthem tonight, and there only used\nto be four. Most disturbing.\nThe band thunder through their\nset, drawn from both their albums,\nand this is where a minor moan\ncomes in. The songs from the debut\nalbum stand head and shoulders\nabove most of the newer stuff, the\nonly two lights from the second\nalbum being Tfie Sea and Mi7e High\nCafe. The new single, which\nthey're presumably here to\npromote, their second biggest chart\nhit ever (Fact!), is the one of the\nworse offenders, though not the\nlowest of the low, and at least they\nmanaged to restrain themselves\nfrom playing their biggest\n(California Dreamin'), much to the\ndisappointment of one particularly\nsad character next to me. Even so,\nthe songs from the new album\nsound better live then they do on the\nalbum, which leads to the possible\nconclusion that the album was over\nproduced. Hmmmm, just a minor\nmoan though, and once I became\nable to ignore the audience, it was\nan enjoyable evening.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Standing In The Need Of Love is\navailable now in good record shops\neverywhere. It is also available at\nOur Price.\nRainbow is the latest to rise from\nthe Candyland stable. The original\ntrack has a style returning to the\nmore mellow aspects of the boys'\nmusic; a cry from Kingdom and\nprobably more commer ic ally appealing. Having said that, the\ndifference doesn't really span a millenium (as they say) and bears\nan uncanny resemblance to Maker\nwhich could lay a minor curse on\nits predicted success.\nSo, Rainbow doesn't look fit to\ngive Candyland the commercial\nbreak they may deserve, but is\nentertaining (did I say\n'entertaining'? or would 'nice' be\nbetter...) in all variety of forms,\nespecially Chapman's swinging\nmixes...\n(I think) my name is Pat.\n^Rainbow is released on\nFiction/Polydor on March 9.\nCandyland play at the Borderline on\nMarch 7.\nCandyland: Not looking like Madness in the slightest.\nOcean Colour Scene - Sway\nof the Bahamas. This makes it quite\nlikable, despite the first track on the\nsecond side sounding like\nsomething, well to be honest, that\nshouldn't be allowed out of its hole.\nTwo years ago this would have been\ninteresting, now its only interest is\nin realising how similar everything\nwas back then. An album out\nshortly, they're starting to tour\nagain, are we going to see Ocean\nColour Scene two? If so they had\nbetter do better than this, likable is\nfar from lovable.\nPebbles\n*Sway is available on Fontana\nnow. Ocean Colour Scene play the\nMarquee, March 13.\nThis takes me back. The heady days\nof 1990, when I was still a teenager,\nwhen you couldn't slag off Robert\nMaxwell, before Bryan Adams was\nnumber one. A re-release of a single\nI can't really recall and I'm finding\nhard to remember even though I listened to it not an hour ago. The\nname is so apt, the mood is\ndefinitely one of extreme\nmellowness, this record washes\nover you like the crystal blue waters\nThe Joshua\nTrioUnderworld\nstyle, this was a very amusing\nevening. I'm am now thoroughly\ncheered up and not that pissed off\nwith Mega City 4. In case you\nhaven't guessed, The Joshua Trio\nare a U2 piss take. Where Abba\nhave Bjorn Again, and Simple\nMinds have James, U2 have The\nJoshua Trio. And they deserve\nthem. Pompous rock gits.\nThundering through the essential\nU2 discography, tearing all of them\napart, segueing other songs in, such\nas DefLeppard's Pour Some Sugar\nOn Me into God Part 2. Their\nhighly disrespectful treatment of\nWhere The Streets..., One,\nMysterious Ways, and the rest is\njust the beginning though. They\nhave readings from The Good Book\n- the gospel of Bono, they tear into\nSinead O' Connor with Nothing\nCompares 2 U2, and the lead singer\nhas an unstoppable desire never to\nstay on the stage for more than two\nminutes. He crawls around the\ndancefloor pretending to be a dog,\nrunning round the whole venue on\na hobby horse, climbing up over\nbarriers, and generally harassing\nthe, in the main, unsuspecting\naudience.\nBut therein lies their only\nproblem. The fact that as soon as\nthey start selling out venues, or\nmoving up to larger stages, he\nwon't be able to.

When the\nproduction might as well be done\nat a big theatre\u2014only it would be\nbetter at a big theatre. When being\nsmall is just an excuse for not being\ngood enough. Life Support by the\nParti Pris Theatre Company is not\none of those.\nThe short play is set in a hospital\nduring visiting hour. It consists of\nfour separate scenes with four\npatients and their visitors. The play\ndescribes the loneliness and\nisolation of hospital life: 'Have you\nbrought me me needles?' He has,\nin a bag, but there's only one.\n'What am I supposed to do with one\nneedle?'\u2014'Knit.'\u2014'You need two.\nThat's the standard. That's how it's done.'\nBut the patients experience also\nthe comfort of peace and quiet and\nthe relief to get away from the\nhassle of life: the hospital as an\nintermediate and not all unpleasant\nstage between life and death. It is\nthis ambiguity that makes it possible\nfor the show to be depressing and\nfunny at the same time. The\ncharacters are simple but so well\nand lovingly acted that they do not\ncollapse into clich es. What is really special about this\nproduction, however, is the\namazing and innovative use of the\nstage props and the integration of\ndance and noise. Instead of a curtain\nThe Roadshow\ncomes to town and we follow a couple of youngsters getting ready\nand excited on their way to this\n'mega-almighty' event. As the play\nprogresses we realise that there is\nmore to this festival than music and\nsexual intrigues. It becomes\nincreasingly clear that the pressure\nof hedonism can be lethal.\nThe highlight of the play is the\nwell performed scene enacting the\nhorror of making decisions at a hectic burger bar.\nWalking down the stairs after the\nplay you think: what was this? A new edition of the Brave New\nWorld theme of a monster-state?\nDJ-hero Smooch as Big Brother?\nThe whole plot remains rather\nnebulous. The poor acting is\ncompounded by the clich es of the\nscript, which is their exaggeration\nand not even funny.\nAnyway, if you want to see for\nyourself, in the tiny but personal\nvenue of the Etcetera Theatre, 265\nCamden High St, take bus 31 or\ntube (Camden) and pay \u00a3 4\n(concessions) plus 75p membership.\nPico.\nDeath and the\nMaiden\nDeath and the Maiden is set in a Latin American country and is\nabout a nervous and paranoid\nwoman called Paulina (played by\nJuliet Stevenson). She had been\nreduced to the pathetic state by the\ntragic events of fifteen years\npreviously.\n\u2022 The years of a cruel dictatorship\nhad left Paulina powerless to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice. The hope\nof a new era hits the country like\na wave and with it Paulina's desire\nfor immediate justice, which a they have one of those folding\nhospital screens on rolls.

Over the past term a number of students have\nasked me what Mr so-and-so actually does, and I frankly do not know.\nMany students have remarked on the serried ranks of numbered boxes\nthat comprise the Sherfield building and wonder what the people inside\nthem actually do. The names above may appear rather random, but\nthey are the most commonly questioned College personalities, covering\nmost aspects of the College.\nIf you would like to enlighten the students and staff of IC could you\nsend me a short piece of 100 words or thereabouts detailing such facts\nas what your present job entails - what you actually do - with its\nrelevance to students at the college. As a guide of what else could be\nincluded, you could write about how long you have been at IC, how\nlong you have been in your present job, what you were doing\npreviously, what you think your main achievement has been whilst\nyou have been here, what your main objectives are for the future and\nwhat, roughly, your background is.\nNaturally, you are at complete liberty not to respond to this, or not\nto answer any one of the above questions.

The agreement is regarded\nby some sections as a Union\n'sellout', with concern centering on\nnew shift patterns. Other sources\nhave told Imperial College News\nNetwork, i CNN, that the Unions\nhave negotiated the agreement\nwhich College management wanted\nall along, though this ignores the\nexistence of confidential documents\nin which Estates Director, Gordon\nMarshall, states his preference for\ncontracting out, or privatisation, of\nthe MSCP services.\nJohn Payne, IC Employee\nRelations Manager, complained to\nFelix about last week's news story\non a possible deadlock on MSC P privatisation talks. He said that 'as\nusual, Felix had got it all wrong,'\nthough eventually conceded that\nhe objected to the word 'deadlock.'\nThe reporter responsible for the\nstory has said that the usage of\nImperial College has been awarded\na19.9% increase in the University\nFunding Council (UFC) research\ngrant.\nThe College also received an\nincrease in its teaching funds of\n3.2%, bringing the total for\n1992/93 to \u00a356.6 million, an\nLevels of student poverty have\nprovoked a furious row this week\nbetween Fleet Street tabloids and\nthe BBC. The storm followed a report broadcast by the Nine\no 'Clock News on Wednesday 12th February, which suggested that\nlevels of debt were forcing students\nto withdraw from their courses.\nThe BBC featured Vicky Byrne,\nwho left Reading University last\nyear after running up a fifteen\nhundred pound debt. Ms Byrne was\nreported to be cleaning houses for\na living, and was intending to return\nto Reading after her debt had been\npaid off.\nThe report was followed a week\nlater by a two page analysis in the\nLondon Evening Standard, which\nalleged ,#i at the report was biased\nand 'distorted'. The claims of bias\nled to the tabling of an Early Day\nmotion in the House of Commons\nby Edwina Currie, which has\nattracted thirteen signatures. The\nmotion was highly critical of the\nWest Midlands Police have arrested\na former student of Imperial\nCollege, Michael Newman, for\nattempting to sell a banned video.\nA plain clothed officer arrested him\nas he was about to sell a copy of\n'Visions of Ecstasy', an 18 minute\nfilm about St Teresa of Avila. He\nwas later released. Talking to Felix,\nMr Newman said that the policeman\nwho offered to buy the video looked\nlike 'a dirty old man,' and when\nthey agreed to the sale the officer\n'sadly showed me his badge.'\nMr Newman explained that he\nwas in Birmingham to launch and\npromote a Humanist leaflet directed\nat school children. This encouraged\ngroups of non-Christians to opt out\nof religious assemblies as part of a greater campaign to encourage\ndebate in individual schools to\n'deadlock' was unfortunate, but that\nboth sides had encountered\ndifficulties in the talks.\nKeith Reynolds, IC Chief\nSecurity Officer, told Felix that an\nannouncement on the final plan is\nto be expected next week.\nincrease of 11% overall. This\ncompares with the total funding for\nthe University of London of\n\u00a3370.23 million, with increases of\n6.1% in teaching funds and 13.7%\nin research funds - a9.9% overall\nincrease - and the national average\nresearch funding increase of 11 %.\nBBC, and follows comments from\nthe Home Secretary, Kenneth\nBaker, that the BBC would have to\nbe 'very careful indeed' over the\nway it intended to cover the general\nelection. The motion will not now\nbe debated.\nThe BBC responded vigorously\nto the allegations by consulting its\nlawyers over The Standard's claims, repeated in the Daily\nExpress and the Sun, and by writing\nto each of the signatories of the\nmotion. The legal advice given\nindicated that the Corporation\nwould win any libel action, but the\nreporter, Mike Baker, said that he\ndid not think it was appropriate to\nissue writs.\nSpeaking to i CNN, the editor of\nthe Daily Express, Sir Nicholas\nLloyd, said that 'we stand by our\nstory'. When told that the BBC had\nissued a similar statement, he said\nthat the BBC always back their\nstories, because in their opinion,\nthey are never wrong. (i CNN) ascertain whether they choose 'a determination.' This is the legal\nway in which schools can decide\nwhether to run religious assemblies.\nMr Newman stated T believe the\ndivinity of Christ is a threat to our\nhumanity.'\nMr Newman was a founder\nmember and chairman of IC\nUnion's TH Huxley Society, is an\nexecutive member of the British\nHumanist Association and has stood\nin previous Union Sabbatical\nelections. He decided to sell the\nvideo, which shows the Spanish\nsaint erotically caressing Christ on\nthe cross, after being told that it was\nillegal to show it.\nThe video was banned three years\nago by the British Board of Film\nClassification on the grounds of\nblasphemy. In this country,\nIC Union president, Zoe Hellinger,\nannounced plans this week for a Union-organised postal vote\nregistration campaign. The\ncampaign has been formulated in\nthe increasing likelihood of the\nGeneral Election occurring during\nthe Easter vacation.\nSpeaking to Imperial College\nNews Network, i CNN, Ms\nHellinger said that she felt very\nstrongly that students should vote in\nthe constituency that would\nmaximise the effect of the student\nvote. A Union ad-hoc committee is\nto begin work on the campaign next\nweek.\nPostal votes can take one of two\nforms. There is the permanent\npostal vote, which can be applied\nfor at any time up to the\nannouncement of the election date,\nand which can be used for an\nelection on any date. The second\ntype is the temporary postal vote,\nwhich applies to an election on a specific date, and which can be\napplied for once the date is\nannounced. Electors have until\nthirteen days before polling day to\napply and return the form.\nStudents are one of a number of\ngroups who can apply for a postal\nvote. This is because students are\nentitled to vote either at their college\nresidence, or at their parental home.\nElectoral returning officers have\nemphasised that it is illegal to vote\nin both places. They are particularly\nconcerned that first year students,\nwho are automatically registered at\ntheir halls of residence, may also try\nto register at their parental address.\nAll three mainstream political\nparties claim to be unconcerned by\nthe election falling during the\nblasphemy is a criminal offence\nwhich applies only to Christianity.\nA police spokesman said 'the matter\nis being referred to the Crown\nProsecution Service for possible\noffences under the Obscene\nPublications Act, the Video\nRecordings Act and the common\nlaw on Blasphemy.'\nMr Newman was reported to be\ndeeply satisfied by his arrest and\nafterwards declared himself to be\ndelighted with his protest against the\nblasphemy laws. Expressing his\nhopes for a trial, he said T laughed\nwhen I was arrested, but I felt sorry\nfor the police who had to watch the\nvideo because it's very boring.' Mr\nNewman added that the whole\nepisode was very 'Monty Python.'\n(i CNN and the Guardian)\nvacation. Ben Rich, from the\nLiberal Democrat policy unit, told\ni CNN that there is no reason for\nstudents not to vote during the\nvacation. However, he added that\nif they didn't vote, the main losers\nwould be 'anti-Tory' parties. Mr Rich felt that this issue had 'been\nblown up a bit'.\nFor Labour, Kate Cinnamon said\n'we have taken various steps to\nensure that students know how\nimportant it is to register. There is\nno evidence holiday elections affect\nthe student vote. Students are\nregistered where the vote matters\nmost.'\nVanessa Ford, press officer at\nConservative Central Office, told\ni CNN 'we would encourage\nstudents to register'. She added that\nas the student vote was mainly anti\nConservative, a vacation election\nwould benefit the Conservative\nparty. However, Ms Ford denied\nthat this factor would be taken into\nconsideration by Mr Major when he\ndecides the election date.\nThe temporary vote form, the\nRPF9a, can be obtained by\nindividual students from their local\ntown hall.

    "content": "Manifestos Felix 928 28 February 1992\nPRESIDENT Tony Baldwin proposed by Bruce Hall\nI am proposing Tony Baldwin as\nUnion President because he is the\nbiggest piss head standing for the\njob. Being Real Ale Society\nchairman this year he is used to\ncarrying fir kin s of ale and should\nfind no difficulty in carrying off\n3,500 copies of Felix should a RAS\nreview appear. Due to his\nunquestionable ability at throwing\nup he should also find it remarkably\neasy to cover the union concert hall\nin sticky gung e. His training in the\ndiplomatic corp should ensure that\nhe pisses off a number of people and\nshould overcome his natural\ndisadvantage of not being a member\nof Dramsoc. Vote Tony he's a thoroughly fine chap.\nDue to the fact that Imperial\nCollege is one of the largest\ndrinking institutions per capita in\nthe country I don't believe the\naverage student cares about\nanything other than beer. As\nchairman of RAS, longstanding\nCAM RA member and beer\nconnoisseur extra ordinaire I believe\nI have your interests at heart.\nInstead of using the Union bar\nprofits to sub sid is e trivial matters,\nsuch as student welfare, ents discos\n& gigs and miscellaneous sponges\nie Dramsoc, beer prices would be\nslashed. This would enable more\nstudents to continue with their\ndrinking degree and continue our\nhigh alcoholic reputation. Vote for\nme, Tony Baldwin,\nfine chap.\nBruce Hall\nA Baldwin\na thoroughly\nPRESIDENT Chris Davidson proposed by Mark Jackson\nI am a second year physicist. Last\nyear I lived in Falmouth Keogh hall\nand am now non res.\nTHE JOB\nThe job of ICU president involves\noverall organisation of the union\nincluding staff and union officers.\nIt also includes areas of\nresponsibility decided by the\npresident and vice president,\nincluding academic affairs,\nac como dati on, sport, welfare,\ntransport and overseas students.\nThe president also sits on various\ncollege commit ees, including\ngoverning body, house commit ee and refectory users commit ee. They\nalso chair ICU exec and\ndisciplinary.\nThere are many other small tasks\nthat the ICU president carries out\nincluding insurance, reciprocal\nmembership and telephone use.\nWHY ME?\nI have a wide ranging experience of\ncollege life and have held several\npositions of responsibility, both\nelected and non elected. I organised\nseveral functions in Falmouth\nKeogh Hall in my first year. I have\nalso been heavily involved in the\nRCSU as a Theta bearer and as\ntransport officer.\nTHE OVERVIEW I don't want the job for the power,\nthe money, or something to do. I want it because I think I would do\na good job and provide an unbiased\nservice for all IC and Mary's students.\nSome of my ideas include :-a) Trying to revamp the housing\nlists issued by the ac como dati on to\nmake them more user friendly.\nb) Try and keep the price of beer\ndown. Based on our barrel age we\nshould have prices that reflect other\nstudent union prices.\nc) Try to increase the amount of\nwelfare and academic literature\navailable in the union office.\nOverall I want to run the union\nsensibly and for the students.\nCHEERS, AND BE GOOD!, CHRIS.\nPRESIDENT Angelo Gardini proposed by Richard Murray\nFirstly, I will carry out my\nresponsibilities professionally and\nto the best of my abilities to ensure\nthat the Union provides the best\nservice it can for students. I am not\na hack or involved in petty union\nwrangling: I want to see the\norganisation running as effectively\nas possible.\nThe Union events have been\nexcellent this year, but\nimprovements in outlets are due.\nThe aspect of what the Union is\nsupposed to do but does not do very\nwell is to provide a 'communications network' for\nstudents to voice their views and for\nthe Union to try and solve the\nproblems and represent the student\nview to College management.\nThe Union structure is very\ncomplex, with many committees\nand procedures. This deters\nstudents from getting involved. The\nUnion must be made more\naccessible to students and\nresponsive to problems. I have\nlearned, through Chairing a( Huxley) society, that teamwork,\ncooperation and communication are\nkey\u2014both within the Union and\nbetween the Union and students and\nthe Union and College. I would\nhope that College would also be\nmore open and that we could\ncooperate\u2014where possible: If we\nthink what College is proposing is\nreasonable. IF not, and the only\ncourse is for \"industrial relations\"\nto break down, then so be it.\nI propose that there be a weekly,\ninformal meeting between Union\nofficers and students to highlight\nproblems and to discuss ideas. Felix\nwill be key to keeping students\ninformed and \"opening up\" the\nUnion. I propose a regular page in\nFelix where we will keep students\ninformed\u2014both generally about\nwhat the Union is doing and also\nwhat was discussed in those\ninformal meetings and any progress\nmade. Thus, a dialogue would start\nand problems would be solved\nquicker.\n\u201414\u2014\n\n"

This is, in my opinion, his\nbest outing since Die Hard (the first\none) and although Mr Willis still\nneeds to discover the wonders of\nGillette Sensor, his personality fits\nthe role of P.I. exceptionally well.\nJoe Hallenbeck (Brucie) has not\nhad a good life. Once one of the\nnation's top secret service agents,\nhe had a run-in with a dirty\npolitician and one frame-up later,\nand Hallenbeck lost his job, his\npension, everything but his gun.\nEven his wife's getting hot and\nsteamy with his best friend and his\ndaughter draws pictures of SatanClaus!! Hallenbeck is now a dirty\ntwo-bit LAP. I. whose best friend\nis killed just after having handed\nhim a small-time case (and having\nbanged his wife). This small-time\ncase gets horribly gunned down in\nfront of her boyfriend (Daman\nWayans) Jimmy Dix. Cue for a crusade to uncover a conspiracy to\nlegal is e gambling.\nJimmy, has his own problems\nbei^g the victim of 'frame-up\nunited', once football player\nextra ordinaire, but now someone\nwho buys 650 dollar leather\ntrousers.\nThe interplay between the\ndetective and the athlete, both\nrefugees from violent professions\nwho become targets in an even\nmore violent world, is what is\nprobably most interesting and the\nscript goes far beyond the standard\n'two guys who don't like each other\nat first, but then...' plotline. What\nis appealing about The Last Boy\nScout is that at its heart it's a tale\nof redemption. Hallenbeck and Dix\nare two lost souls who find\nthemselves through helping each\nother and by joining efforts in a common cause (sounds shite, eh?),\nanyway, Shane Black (screenplay)\nwrites amazing action scenes; the\ncharacters are so fully drawn that\nyou can almost smell them and their\nenvironment, and as is now\ncommon-place in films of the hard-boiled private eye genre (i.e. Die\nHard, Lethal Weapon, Beverly\nHills Cop) it has a very sharp sense\nof humour.\nIt has an 18 certificate so we are\nguaranteed plenty of overkill on the\n7 swear to God there's a review missing' (c.f. Darwen)\n'You fart like that again, I 'll blow your God damn face off'\nFX side, infinitely better than\nLethal Weapon, Die Hard etc, a very high blood count, plenty of\nclose ups on the head shots, all in\nall, the best all-out action movie in\nages, one that does Bruce\nMoonlighting Willis proud.

    "content": "Cuts Sabbatical Elections\nThe Government has been accused\nof trying to use charity research\nfunds to offset university funding\ncuts. This follows the\nannouncement of plans for a40% increase in university laboratory\ncharges. The move has been\ncondemned by research institutions,\nand medical charities are\nthreatening a mass pull out of\nresearch at British universities.\nOver 400 scientific posts are\nunder immediate threat following\nwarnings from the Cancer Research\nCampaign (CRC) that it intends to\ncancel its \u00a325 million investment in\ncancer treatment. The CRC scientific director, Professor\nGordon McVie, said 'we are not\ngoing to pay more to do the same\nresearch. We will spend our money\nelsewhere in our institutes'.\nThe overall figure that could be\naffected is \u00a3300 million annually.\nMost of this money comes from\nmedical research charities such as\nthe Imperial Cancer Research Fund,\nthe Cancer Research Campaign, the\nWellcome Trust and others. In the\npast these bodies have paid for\nresearch project costs while\nuniversities have provided support\nfacilities such as technicians,\nlibraries and administration. The\nnew Government funding plans\nrequire universities to cost and\ncharge for the real price of research\nin their laboratories. This could lead\nto a price rise of 40%.\nThe consequence of this is likely\nto be a cut of 40% in the value of\nresearch projects. David Bowles,\nthe vice provost of University\nCollege London said that in 1990,\nUniversity College accepted \u00a39\nmillion in donations, but will now\nhave to charge an additional \u00a33\nmillion. Liverpool University\nresearchers have warned that 'if the\nresearch charities refuse to pay, we\nwill be in dire straits'.(i CNN) Use your vote carefully. Look what happened last time.\nFifteen candidates have declared\nthat they are standing for an IC\nUnion sabbatical post. The\ncampaign begins tonight, when\nsabbatical papers come down at\n5.30pm. Eleven of the candidates\nare fully seconded and the other\nfour are expected to have\ndifficulties in ensuring they are fully\nseconded.\nWith little known about the\ncandidates the campaign is in\ndanger of becoming completely\nanonymous, but hustings are\nexpected to breathe life into this\nworthless corpse.\nThe presidential candidates are:\nAnthony Baldwin, proposed by\nBruce Hall, and fully seconded;\nChris Davidson, proposed by Mark\nJackson, also fully seconded; New\nElection, proposed by Steve\nFarrant, and in no need of\nsecond ers; Angelo Gardini,\nproposed by Richard Murray, with\n18 second ers; and Rick Bilby,\nproposed by James Briadt, with 12\nsecond ers. The last time that five candidates\nran for president was 1985/6 and it\nis believed that one additional\ncandidate will be standing for\npresident by the time papers come\ndown. The deputy president al race\nis a straight contest between Phil\nSharp and New Election. Both\ncandidates are fully proposed and\nseconded. An earlier candidate,\nCharles Tomkins, withdrew from\nthe contest over the weekend.\nThe Honorary Secretary (Events)\ncampaign has produced a choice\nselection of five: Nick Allen,\nproposed by Laurie McNamee,\nfully seconded; New Election,\nproposed by Steve Farrant, no\nsecond er needed; Aled Fenner,\nproposed by David Goddard, fully\nseconded; Stefan Smith, proposed\nby Chris Pease, eight second ers; and Sarah Harland, proposed by\nSteve Newhouse, seven second ers. The sabbatical campaign is\nwound down by the Felix editor\nelection. The three candidates are:\nJonty Beavan, proposed by Richard\nEyers, fully seconded; New\nElection, as before; and Toby\nJones, proposed by Sarah Harland,\nfully seconded.\nTwenty other students are\nstanding for non sabbatical posts.\nThese are handbook editor,\nhonorary member of council,\nacademic affairs officer, welfare\nofficer, external affairs officers, rag\nchairman, ents chairman, ICCA G chairman, U GM chairman,\nwomen's officer and housing\nofficer.\nThis information was correct at\nthe time of writing, though more\nrecent developments may render\nthis story inn accurate.

This will not\nchange until more Imperial and St\nMary's students become involved in\nwhat happens in Felix and the print\nunit. I will try and make Felix more\nrepresentative in several ways;\nReviews Felix receives tickets to all\nnational film releases and most of\nthe theatres in West London. This\nis far too much information to be\nincluded in 2 or 3 reviews pages.\nI would expand the 'what's on'\nsection to provide a proper\nentertainments guide to our part of\nLondon.\nMusic Music pages will cover a broader range of music; this could\ninclude rock, cajun and shock,\nhorror, even classical music.\nFeatures I would ensure Felix\ninitiated debate, by performing its\nown investigations, drawn from a range of points of view not just the\nsame old people having a go at each\nother again.\nNews As news editor I have helped\nto set up Imperial College News\nNetwork (i CNN) which is all three\ncollege media (IC Radio, STOIC\nand Felix) working together to\ncover news. I think shall expand\nthis to include communications with\nother Student Newspapers and\nUniversities.\nThis will not be enough to get\nstudents involved in Felix. This can\nonly be done by making Felix more\naccessible to every student. I intend\nto hold meetings outside the Felix\nOffice to get feedback on how\npeople feel about our newspaper.\nAll I need is your support and your\nvote. It only takes 3'/2 seconds.\nFELIX EDITOR Toby Jones proposed by Sarah Harland\nToby is one of the originals. He\nwalked into the Felix office on the\nfirst day of his first year, and never\nescaped. In that time he's mastered\neverything, from writing to\nwrangling, and is one of the few to\nhave mastered the fiendish\ntypesetter. He has the three qualities\nfor an Editor - wit, diplomacy and\ninsomnia.\nIf in doubt, ask Toby.\nFelix\nIt is important that Felix informs\nand entertains. To continue to\ndeliver high quality, in-depth news,\nI will be backing the news network\ni CNN, which unites Felix, Stoic\nand IC Radio. In addition, the\nWhat's On page will gain new life,\nwith closer liaison with clubs and\nEnts.\nA lively letters page, prize\ncompetitions, and controversial\nreviews could be a recipe for an\ninteresting read during boring\nFriday mornings. Felix doesn't carry enough cartoons or humorous\narticles - I could blindly promise\nmore but it's only possible to print\nthe material received. Making the\nFelix office less imposing would\nencourage students to submit their\nwork; I will strive to make visitors\nwelcome and give encouragement\nto budding authors.\nGiving you the opportunity to\nvoice an opinion is a theme close\nto the heart of Felix. I won't hide\nin the office, but visit Silwood,\nSt.Mary's and departments around\ncollege.\nPrint Unit\nThe print unit is currently under\nheavy demand and clubs are losing\nout on publicity. I am confident that\na better service can be offered so\nI will be working towards making\nthe print unit into a separate Union\noutlet. This would leave the Felix\nEditor to concentrate on producing\na top quality paper whilst ensuring\nthat Union print work is processed\npromptly.\nVote for a Felix worth stealing:\nToby Jones\n\u201416\u2014\n\n"

Despite being reduced to\nnine men through injury early on,\nthey beat the northern area team in\nthe semi-finals but were finally\nbeaten but Scotland in the final.\nReg Cook took an individual\nsilver medal in the U60kg weight\ncategory and went on to take a further silver in the combined\nBritish Universities and\nPolytechnics competition and as\nsuch is under selection for the\nBritish student squad for the\nforthcoming World Student\nChampionships.\nOn Saturday 22nd February, the\nLadies Badminton team set off to\nBirmingham for the semi-finals of\nthe U AU. Our opponent was Exeter\nUniversity. It was a bright morning\nand we had a fairly comfortable\njourney apart from the fact that\nthere were a few drunken football\nsupporters on our carriage who\nwere singing on top of their voices,\n(they thought they were good!) It\nwas nearly 1pm when we arrived at\nBirmingham University sports hall.\nThe mens semis were almost\nfinished as we watched them dive\nmadly on court for the last few\nAny of you who missed out on the\nScience Museum Christmas lecture\n(1991), will get a second chance to\nsee it on Monday, 2nd March in\nElec Eng 408, at 6.30pm. Just\nfollow the arrows from the Elec\nEng entrance. The good news is\nwhat you would have paid \u00a35 for at\nChristmas, you'll get for free with\nSEDS - what a great organisation!\nApollo 8 was the first mission to\nfly men around the moon, during\nChristmas 1968. The mission was\na major step, being only the second\nApollo mission to fly, especially\nconsidering that three astronauts\nhad died in preparations for the first\npoints. As Birmingham Uni had\nboth their mens and ladies teams in\nthe semis, there was tremendous\nsupport for them. The hall was\nfilled with loud cheers for the\nBirmingham teams. However,\nneither were we, in any way,\nintimidated nor discouraged.\nWe went on court, against Exeter\nUni and began our fight for a place\nin the finals. Exeter had a very\nstrong first pair. Although we\nfought bravely, we could not match\ntheir skills. The speed of play was\nso much faster which took us a long\nwhile to get used to. After a long\nApollo mission a year and a half\nearlier.\nAll went well with the mission,\nthe first to bring back high quality\nmovie pictures of the lunar surface,\nand 'earth rise' as viewed from the\ncommand module. Just three\nmissions and a mere seven months\nlater, man landed on the moon -Apollo 11, 20th July 1969.\nDuring the talk you will have an\nopportunity to see original Apollo\nhardware and pictures, together\nwith film footage of the mission;\nwhich will help to capture the\natmosphere of those pioneering\ndays...\ntiring battle, we were beaten 7-2.\nIt was a very good experience for\nus and even though we lost, we\nwere satisfied that we had reached\nthis far. We truly enjoyed the high\nstandard of badminton there. (We\nalso saw some England players\nthere!) When we returned to\nLondon, we rewarded our efforts\nby a Chinese meal in Chinatown\n(we were starving by then!).\nEverybody had an enjoyable time\nand are looking forward to next\nyears U AU. Backdraft\nThis Thursday before the feature\npresentation, the audience will be\ntreated to another classic cartoon\nshort: Sylvester and Tweety Pie.\nThe main film of the evening will\nbe one of the big blockbusters of\nlast summer - the conflagration\nspectacular, Backdraft. Directed by\nRon Howard (Splash and\nParenthood), the film stars Kurt\nRussell, Jim Baldwin, Donald\nSutherland and Robert De Niro.\nCome along and see it for\nyourself on Thursday 5th March at\n7.30pm in Mech Eng 220. Entrance\nis 80p for members and \u00a31.80 for\nnon-members.\nHuxley\nDuring the summer term the\nHuxley Society will be bringing out\nan issue of its magazine\nEXPERIMENT. We want you to\ncontribute some writing. The\nHuxley Society was set up in the\nearly '60s to promote the teaching\nof TH Huxley and the ideas of\nHumanism.\nThe magazine sets out to examine\nlife. It takes as its starting point the\nidea that beliefs should be\nreasonable, and that we should\njudge and develop our beliefs by\nmeans of experiment. Such is the\napproach of the scientist. The\ncoming issue will focus on life\nexperience.\nIt is a tenet of Humanism that on\nthe basis of the available evidence,\nthe probability is that God does not\nexist. This renders all religion\ninvalid; but the absence of religion\nleaves a discernible void. What\nreligions do is to demand blind faith\nin one or other God and go on to\npresent an appropriate body of\nwisdom. From this wisdom is\nderived a set of principles which we\n(the devotees) are to live our lives,\nand by which we can increase the\nprofundity of our existences. A nonbelief in God should not however\ndiminish the importance of wisdom.\nWhat is required is a wisdom that\nhas a credible footing. We need to\nstart from life experience.\nHumans exist and emotions exist.\nIndividually we have ideas about\nwhat is profound and what is\nsuperficial. There is also a good\ndeal of correlation between the\nideas of different people.\nWe therefore ask you for writings\nabout what you consider most\nfundamental in life. What has\nprovided the strongest experience?\nWhen you are in your deathbed\nwhat will you have lived for?\nSubmit pieces to Sam Stacey,\nCivil Eng 1, by 15th March.\nAthletics\nThe University of London InterCollegiate Athletics Championships\nshall take place on Saturday 14th March 1992 at Tooting Bee Track.\nThis competition will be a selection\nprocess for the University of\nLondon Athletics team. If anyone\nis interested in attending, please\ncould they contact the Imperial\nCollege Athletics Captain,\nLawrence Fowkes (Mech Eng III).\nThere shall also be athletics training\ndays for students at the Battersea\nPark Athletics Track on Thurdays\nat 6.30pm and Sundays at 11am. \u201421 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion Felix 928 28 February 1992\nChris Riley\nwaves adieu to\nhis doctorate in\ncirca one\nthousand words\nWith a recommended gestation\nperiod of three years, giving birth\nto a PhD thesis can take anything\nfrom between two and ten years.\nFew are ever premature and forty\nper cent of PhDs started are\nterminated at between six to thirty-six months of age. There is no such\nthing as a normal birth, many\nrequiring caesarean sections. Why\nsuch a high mortality rate? It\nappears that most mistakes are\nmade at the moment of conception,\nby couples consumed by false\npassion.\nToo many students blunder into\na PhD project without even\nconsidering what it's all about. The\nwhole lifestyle of research is far\nremoved from any structured\nundergraduate existence or graduate\ntrainee scheme. No first degree can\nprepare you for the confusion and\nindecision of that first year. Unlike\nthe PhDs of other European\ncountries there are no lectures, and\nno course plans. You have nothing\nmore specific than a vague essay\ntitle and a deadline over one\nthousand days away. It is entirely\nDIY and the 'freedom' is\noverwhelming. The expanse of\ntrackless sand and that mystical\ndestination is, to say the least,\ndaunting. Without direction or\nguidance this distant goal is too far\nout of sight for most students to\ncomprehend. Many go round in\ncircles for months or years before\ndying of exhaustion 'Doctorless'.\nHow many eight year olds do you\nknow who could navigate their way\nacross the Gobi without a map or\ncompass? The trouble is there is no\nmap of the PhD. This mystical\ninvertebrate beast is without\ndefinition. A physics PhD thesis can\nbe as slim as twenty pages. Earth\nscience theses sometimes run to\nthree volumes. 'You're a bright\nlad.. .do something clever for three\nyears and write a story about it' is\nperhaps the most accurate definition\nI 've yet heard.\nBut beware, blissful as this might\nsound, your final bouncing thesis\nmust, (in the eyes of the examiners)\ncontribute something new and\noriginal to the scientific community.\nNo mean feat for someone without\na map. Not only have you got to\nreach that distant town, but you\ncan't follow a previous route.\nWhich direction do you set off in,\nand how long do you walk for\nbefore changing tact? However\nindependent a student feels at the\nstart, there comes a time when\none's research methods need\nverifying for a reassurance that you\nare heading in the right direction.\nIn those first six months it is too\ntempting to stick your head in the\nsand and wait for your supervisor\nto pull it out and hand over a compass.\nUnfortunately for many students,\nthe desert you're trying to cross is\ninfinite, and the destination\nnon-existant.\nToo many PhD projects are\nsimply ill conceived; based on one\npoorly researched page of vague\ntext lacking logistical substance.\nNumerous proposals are dreamt up\nat parties or in the pub. Sweeping\ngeneralisations and massively\ngrandiose ideas conceal\nim practicalities and un solvable problems. Surely a project which is\nto keep the attention of an individual\nfor three years deserves more\nthought.\nBut these alcohol-hazed, crack\npot projects need converting into\nreal science; a task which is all too\noften impossible. For example how\nis Helen going to investigate\nsubsurface faulting in South African\nMines, when local law bars women\nfrom stepping underground? Few\nproposals pause to even check that\nappropriate computer facilities are\navailable in departments to support\nsuch projects.\nLove can make you blind, and\nonly too often students tempted by\nsuperficially glossy projects, refuse\nto see the pitfalls which lie in the\nroad ahead. So you are going to\ninterpret radar maps of Io but the\nsatellite isn't quite in orbit yet.\n'Don't worry it will be sending back\ndata by the end of your first year\u2014\nwhich is always spent just reading\nanyway.' But remember if it\ndevelops a fault twelve months later\nyou will be left up a certain watery\nchannel without a certain wooden\ninstrument. Make sure you are\nguaranteed some data to work on.\n'The geochemistry of Antarctic\ncarbonaceous chondrites' might\nmean a couple of freebee trips to the\nsnowy continent; even the\nadvertising blurb seems to\nguarantee this. Although you're not\nparticularly turned on by the\nthought of dissolving extraterrestrial rocks for three years,\nyou'd do anything for a trip to\nAntarctica. Anyway, anything is\npreferable to the empty job market,\nisn't it? But when you turn up for\nthe interview and enquire about\nfieldwork, the desperate supervisor\nadmits that 'the meteorites will\nactually be from a dusty museum\ncollection, and the project is really\nlab based with little chance of any\ntravel'. Not really where a budding\nSir Vivian Fuches wants to spend\nthe next three years. It's a good job\nyou asked before you signed away\nyour life to be tethered to a test tube\nfor the next ten thousand hours.\nQuestion your real motives for\nstepping into a research degree.\nWhat might have vaguely interested\nyou about the sleeping patterns of\nleft handed New Guinnean Tree\nShrews, was really the lack of\nalternatives; with a complete\nabsence of employment for\ngraduate zoologists. Remember you\nmust eat sleep and breath tree\nshrews for 1095 days. One is better\noff unemployed with time to think,\nthan blindly blundering into a Pregnancy of a PhD\n\u201418\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "28 February 1992 Felix 928 Editorial\neditorial\nMany thanks to all those members\nof College staff who responded to\nthe survey on pages 12 and 13.\nEven so, I fail to understand why\na number of them submitted their\nresponses at 3.00pm on Tuesday,\nway after the 12.30pm Monday\ndeadline. This meant that I had to\nre paste the entire page and I didn't finish until 2.00am the following\nmorning. I gave the survey two\npages because I allocate pages on\nMonday afternoon. This would\nhave looked reasonable with the\nnumber of responses I had at the\ntime - but now it looks extremely\ncramped. Do they not know the\nmeaning of the word 'deadline?'\nLack of sleep gets me very ratty\nindeed - anyway, thanks for\nresponding, even if it was late.\nIn response to Val Straw's query\nconcerning Union ties - the\nacquisition of ICU Colours allows\nyou to buy the tie, it is not provided.\nI wonder why the Union considers\nit an honour to allow those\nhonoured to buy a tie.\nAids Awareness\nIn response to Ola Olulode's letter\nopposite -1 do not think the picture\nwas wholly inappropriate, after all\nthe Terrence Higgins Trust's modus\noperand i is to never avoid\nun savoury images, to avoid coyness\nand euphemisms, and by so doing\nto encourage all types of people to\nask for help. Many people enjoy\nfantastic al sado-masochism - merely\nbecause some people find the idea\nun savoury is no reason to pretend\nit doesn't exist. Equally, I would\nlike to point out that seven pages\nworth of AIDS stuff appeared in the\nFelix Office over Monday, with no\naccompanying pictures except two\nline drawings and a Terrence\nHiggins Trust leaflet. I did expect\nsome AIDS information that week,\nbut was not given any indication as\nto how much. I had to find some\nsemi-relevant pictures myself, no\npictures at all would have resulted\nin a completely unreadable layout.\nIf you can't help, then put up with\nmy decision.\nAll things said, the letter was\nbetter reasoned than most criticisms\nI have received recently, and more\neffective because it was concise and\nto the point. The long waf fly rants\nthat have been filling up the letters\npage recently are becoming very\ntedious.\nLarceny Letter\nI hope that the other DramSoc or\nOpSoc people responsible for the\nFelix theft of four weeks ago can\ngather enough courage together to\ndo the same as Darren Holmes has\nthis week. Own up for your actions\n- there will be no victim is ation. Mr Holmes brings up an interesting\npoint - that he has no respect for\npublications that print sheer fiction.\nDoes this include letters? Steve\nNewhouse did not write that\nreview, and if he had he would be\neminently qualified to report on\n'Grease' as he had sacrificed a weekend afternoon to see the\nrehearsal, which was so awful it\nwas decided that it would be unfair\nto base a review on it. The first\nnight was the latest performance\nfrom which a review could be\nwritten to be published that week.\nMr Holmes says that the first night\n'was a little rough around the\nedges.... but after that I found little\ntruth in the article in question.'\nDoes he expect reviewers to be\nclairvoyant? You cannot base a review on a performance you\nhaven't seen. Apart from that, I thank him for the letter, and I hope\nhis colle gue s follow suit, though not\nnecessarily at such length.\nLibellous Journalism\nDoes it never end? My response to\nDavid Buckle's letter is simply to\nsay a serious sense of humour\nfailure seems to have occured here.\nWhy be so sensitive? For God's sake there are more important\nthings in t ne world than\ncomplaining about piff ling little\ncomments which aren't going to\naffect anything anyway. We seem\nto be on the old chestnut of telling\na newspaper that it can't print\nsomething. Also - look at how many\narticles there are in this issue of\nFelix - does anyone honestly expect\neveryone concerned to be contacted\nover each article before printing? If\nyou do, why don't you do it. You\nonly get the Felix that students put\nwork into - you only get the Union\nyou deserve.\nCredits\nAndy T, Mario, Sam, Khurrum,\nPoddy, Stef, Richard, Peter Wright,\nIan, James, Catherine, the other\nAndy, D HB, Rose, le Pingouin,\nHoward Lee, Simon, Boris, Jonty,\nDeclan, Toby, Jeremy, Steven, all\nthe College staff who responded to\nthe survey, Chris Riley, Stuart,\nMarge, Bee, the partially\nmasticated black bin liners of the\nback and opaque fungus progeny.\nUnion Rant\nDear Adam,\nElection time again? I was going to\nwrite what I thought of the\ncandidates, but apparently I'm not\nallowed to do that. Censorship from\nICU Tower again. Apparently it\nwould influence the elections!! It's supposed to. It's supposed to\nprevent the same situation as this\nyear, where we get incompetence,\nself-interest and sod-all concern for\nthe students.\nBut the Union permanent staff are\nno better (no, not you Rose and\nAndy, before I get cut brutally). I'm talking about the receptionists, who\nhave seats so they can look down\ntheir noses at the students, and still\nkeep them stuck up; the catering\nstaff, who manage to provide stingy\nportions, overpriced chocolate,\noccasionally(l), when the machine\nactually works and still make a loss,\nleading to subsidy from higher\ndrinks prices\u2014another attack on\nstudents' already depleted pockets,\nand bookstore staff, with their petty\nrulings (no Switch transactions\nbelow \u00a3 3 , even though Switch\npayments cost them not a single\npenny!).\nSo what do I suggest? You will\nhave two options.\n1. Listen to the rhetoric, and see\nwhich pathetic specimen is least\nunconvincing in their pledges to\nwork for the students, or\n2. New election: kick out the\nJAMMS.\nLove and Hugs,\nPoddy\nPoddy has asked me to inform the\nworld that I would not allow this\nletter on the music pages. Might\nI add also that all letters on the\nletters page are the opinion of\nindividuals and I have little right\nto censor them - Adam.\nPhilosophy Answer\nDear Adam,\nColourful Philosophy: some\nquestions.\nIn Felix 926, Alva Gosson\npresented 'a possible colour\nscheme'. I would like to make some\ncomments. The comments are\npresented in a fairly arbitrary order.\nSummed up, they may be trying to\nsay that Gosson's colour scheme is\ntoo idealistic.\n1. 'A region of that universe is\nthus in duplicate'. Why? If a region\nof O space is independent of all\nperception than Reality (i. e.O's perception of O space) will not be\nthe same. These should not,\ntherefore, be any duplication of Ospace. (In fact, given in O's, there\nare likely to be in Realities.)\n2. 'Everything O knows about\nthat universe comes from his\nperceptions'. This is an incredibly\nstrong statement, refuting all/any\nexistence of a priori knowledge. But\nis this so, then anything that O thinks, find, believes, or is troubled\nabout has no absolute basis. For\ninstance, 'O finds that observers\nhave a brain in which...': how can\nO be confident of this statement\nwhen the sole basis of its truth value\nis O's sense-date?\n3. 'O thinks about 'O space'. By\ndefinition O cannot do this! O can\nthink only of reality (i.e. his\nperception of O space).\n4. 'O finds that everything neatly\nfits into units with no leftovers, each\nwith a name.' Gosson's notion of\nO space seems far too idealistic!\nDoes this mean that everything is\ncomplete, that all problems have\nsolutions?\n5. The idea of O space as a huge\ntree of connections is an interesting\none. There is, however, no need to\nhold it 'lifeless' and hope that it has\n'more diversity an colour'. It may\nbe that O space evolves through\nmany dimensions. Suppose, for\ninstance, that the units (which\nconnect to form the tree) were\nin e pendent ly active (i.e., they could\nperform actions which had\nconsequences). It's now easy to\nimagine O space evolving through,\nfor instance, the time dimension.\nThe branches of the tree can be\nperceived to grow, die, interleave:\nO space continuously restructuring.\n6. '...cells simplify messages...'.\nWhy? Can observers' brains not\nassimilate complex structures?\n7. Gosson's world is about\nmechanics. But there are deeper,\nmore fundamental questions. Why,\nfor instance, does O space exist at\nall? Why does O exist? How does\nO know that he exists?\nSamin Ishtiaq,\nComputing I. \u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

The event was the\nfirst to be organised by the new Rag\nRaid Coordinator, Stuart Rison.\nThe event almost didn't happen\nwhen the collection permits were\nleft behind at Imperial at the start\nof the day. However swift\ncoordination between Mr Rison and\nPenguin, the Rag Chair who had\nstayed behind to work for the day,\nmeant that the licences were faxed\nthrough to the Bath University\nlibrary where they were collected\nby Mr Rison and his team.\nIt is alleged that high jinks\noccurred at Bath before the party\nreturned, with the IC minibus being\ncovered in bugs and having it's number plate removed. It does\nhowever seem that all was not one\nsided, but at present details have not\nbeen released.\nPenguin stated 'It was an\nexcellent day. All that took part\nenjoyed themselves, a vast amount\nwas raised and Stuart really excelled\nhimself in his new post. I'm pleased.'\nMr Rison said that the next raid\nwill be near the start of next term,\nthough the destination is still to be\ndecided. Everyone is welcome, and\nanyone interested should visit the\nRag office during any lunchtime\nduring the week (ex cl. Tues) and\nput their name down as being\ninterested. Mr Rison also extended\nhis thanks to Steve Newhouse for\nnot only driving, but also collecting\n\u00a377 on the day.\nOn Wednesday 4th March, Rag will\nbe doing 'what it does best', with\na City of London licence which\nincludes mainline stations, the\nLondon Underground and the\nLloyds building. This is a great\nchance for some profitable\ncollecting.\nNext\nSo come along to Friday's Rag\nmeeting in the Union Lounge for\ndetails.\nBe mad, be silly, be part of it.\nBitchWord 1\nBy Toot'n 'Murph\nAcross\nI Metallic Courage?(4,2,5)\n7 Leave tail to lessen burden.(9)\n9 Jean-Paul sat, reflecting.(5)\n10 Fence a tiger, a bit long in\nthe tooth.(5)\nII 1,7,9,10.(3,2,3,5)\n12 Confusing optic subject.(5)\n14 Little bird is a twit.(5)\n15 Validates previous\ndrooling.(9)\n16 Edit and Emit will not wait\nback.(4,3,4)\nDown\n2 Delve.(5)\n3 Is St. Peter ecstatic with the\nnumber on his gate?(7,6)\n4 Smear large amounts of\npaper.

The\nthought occurs that it might be his\nobsession with football which\ncaused the end of it... Skipping over\nThisness, in which he gets over it,\nand finds a rhyme for ancestry, and\nthe lads figure out that Stuffie\nsound, and onto the latest single,\nComeuppance, a track which goes\non too long.\nCottager is about how he feels\nabut England, for TYS are typically\nEnglish; The boys get into a more\njan gly feel, which they retain for a redone Seasonstream. Dominic the\ndrummer does some additional\nvocals on this track, so to retain\nbalance the next track is an\ninstrumental, with the shipping\nforecast at the start.\nNonplussed was presumably\nsome other reviewer's opinion of\nthe track of that name, and\nAbsentee returns to the 0-0 a. e.t. style, both thematically and\nmusically, albeit slightly slower,\nand somewhat devoid of football.\nLast Up, First To Go is where the\nlads really discover the Eight\nLegged Groove Machine, and Steve\ncampaigns for the (totally\njustifiable) demolition of the\nHammersmith Odeon, shitty venue\nand host nation of the 1992 brits\nawards.\nDrawing to a close, with another\ne.p. cut, Buttermouth, which makes\nvery little sense lyrically, and is\ndistinctly indie- rock ie. Wideshire\nis where our Stephen sings about\n\"aspiring to greatness in the\nafternoon' and the lads bring the\nalbum to a close.\nWell Aard.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Hands On is available now on\nStifled Aardvark/Polydor: Aard\n008/513-001.\nSilverfish - ULU\nWhen you go to a gig, do you\nexpect to see a man set himself on\nfire? This is not a prize question,\nit's rhetorical. (No it's not, Mr. B., it's a potato.)\nNo, you don't. We did when we\nwent to see Silverfish. He is a professional fireman, so don't try\nthis at home, kids.\nSilverfish have thus gained\nthemselves a place in the hall of\nf(l) ame. And they deserve it. They\nactually earned it through the\nindisputable fact that their caustic\nsound is of cosmic proportions.\nLesley prancing around stage in a nightie, like a Scottish whirlwind,\nis also a majorly frightening\nexperience, enough to scare any\nreviewer into giving a good review,\nespecially when you see her up\nclose. UL U is too small a venue to\nreasonably expect to contain such\na fearsome character. The cunning\nploy of making us stay to the end\nto hear Hips, Tits, Lips, Power and\nTotal Fucking Asshole forcing us to\nsee the entire set, instead of slinking\noff to the bar would work for any\nother band. Take note, lesser\nmortals.\nIncidentally, has anyone noticed\nthat Creation are taking over the\nindie charts? (Rhetorical, darlings)\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Silverfish's With Scrambled Eggs\nep is lingering around the top of the\nindie charts. Silverfish support\nEMF on April 30, at the Astoria.\nSilverfish with scrambled eggs\nIngredients:\nlib. silver fish, 8 eggs, lib lard,\nrice wine, gourmet powder, salt.\nMethod:\nWash the silver fish clean. Cook in\nboiling water until tender and drain.\nPour shelled eggs, rice wine,\ngourmet powder and salt in a bowl\n. and'whip. Put lard into a heated\npan. When the oil is hot, pour in\negg mixture. Stir-fry over low\nflame for a few seconds. Put in the\nsilver fish together with lard. Again\nstir-fry for a few seconds over a medium fire and serve.\nSilverfish: Without scrambled eggs.\n\u2014 1 \u2014\n\n"
