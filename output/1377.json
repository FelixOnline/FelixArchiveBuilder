    "content": "23\nfelix\nFriday 16 March 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMexican standoff \u2013 Ghost Recon 2\nSomething bad\u2019s going on south of the border. For a job like this, you need a man like Robin Andrews\nW\nelcome back\nto Mexico: the\nGhosts are back\nfor some unfinished business,\nand this time things have taken a\nturn for the worse. One year after\nthe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Mexico City, the\nrebel uprising has spread to most\nof Latin America, and support from\noverseas nations means conflict\nbetween loyalist Mexican soldiers\nand the insurrectionists erupts\nonce again; the difference this time\nis that it is no longer isolated to the\ncapital city. Most of the long-antici-pated sequel takes place in Juarez,\na city along the Mexico-US bor-der, and as a result the fighting is\nbrought a lot closer to home.\nThe player once again takes up\nthe mantle of Captain Mitchell as\nthe infamous Ghost squad\u2019s team\nleader. Using near-future technology and high-tech weaponry your\nmission is to stop the insurgency.\nAlthough this sounds an awful lot\nlike a marketing line, it is for once\nthe most truthful way of describing\nthis game: you do indeed have re-alistic-yet-advanced technology to\nassist you, and you are able to command a series of squad members,\nas well as numerous tanks, gun-ships, and, for the first time, bomb-ers. The story, whilst being slightly\nless developed than that of the pre-quel, keeps the game flowing at a\nrapid pace and gives the player an\nexcuse to be thrust into several life-or-death situations.\nDespite the fact that there are\nmany squad-based tactical shooters out there, the first instalment\nin the Advanced Warfighter series\nmanaged to make a mark: fluid\ncontrols, the clever Cross-Com (al-lowing you to see through the eyes\nof your commanders, squad mem-bers, or allied vehicles), and varied,\nintense, and consistently thrilling\naction led to huge sales and two\nBAFTA Awards. And although the\ngameplay and presentation is the\nsame recipe, there are several aspects of this game that mean this is\nmore than just an update.\nThe Cross-Com itself has been\nupdated; not only can you still see\nthrough the eyes of your allies\nthrough your left eye and view news\nreports and mission data through\nyour right, but you are now able to\nenlarge the screen. From here you\ncan order your allies from their per-spective, and not just yours, essentially allowing you greater strategic\noptions when attacking the enemy.\nThe gameplay never lets up its\ndramatic, heart-pounding momen-tum, and the incredible variety of\nmission objectives ensures you\nnever stop shaking from the sheer\nvolume of adrenaline being pumped\ninto your blood. Right from the very\nbeginning the battle sequences are\nboth intense and frequent, and with\na greater variety of vehicular-re-lated sections, you always feel as\nif you are part of a citywide battle,\nrather than a series of fire-fights.\nAt the beginning of one mission,\nyou are tasked with extracting a\njournalist, given two squads\nto command, and as usual\na choice of weapons and\nsquad members, ranging from sniper rifles\nand shotguns to\nC4 det-packs.\nThroughout the mission you are\ngiven air-support for the armoured\nfoes, countersniping equipment,\nand several anti-air batteries to\ntake out. After a particularly difficult mission, the sight of your extraction is an immensely pleasing\none; what\u2019s even more draining is a\nvisceral twist like an exfiltration being ambushed by the insurgents.\nApart from the brilliant squad-based sections and the use of satisfying weaponry at your disposal, the\nvehicles are a welcome return to\nthe series. The hostiles are equally impressive \u2013 every time you\u2019re\npinned down by a tank or gunship\nyou can\u2019t help but fear what will\nhappen if you peek your over the\nwreckage. Arguably, the introduction of airstrikes is the best gameplay addition: near the beginning\nof the game you\u2019re ambushed in a\nmarket area, and are forced to fend\noff waves of troops and tanks without any support; the instant you are\nable to designate targets, however,\nit\u2019s impossible not to watch in awe\nas a blur appears on your screen,\nfollowed by a river of fire.\nDifficulty-wise, it\u2019s roughly equal\nto its bigger brother, but this time\naround it gets difficult far quicker,\nso newcomers to the tactical-shoot-er franchise will need to learn fast.\nThe graphical wonder has been\namplified this time around, and\nalthough it doesn\u2019t provide\nthe same impact it did in 2006 it still\nstands out amongst the next-gen\ngames that exist today. The detailed\ncityscapes, the immaculate charac-ters, the heat haze on the horizon,\nand, of course, the truly spectacular\nexplosions really help to immerse.\nThe third-person perspective is\nperfect for this type of game; with\nbullets literally millimetres away\nfrom your head, the screen shaking\nas hostile armour moves towards\nyour position, and the panoramic\nview only achievable through this\nviewpoint gives the eerie feeling of\nbeing reported on during combat\nsituations. Watching vehicles storm\nahead of you and your squad members do their best to keep the enemy\npinned-down all adds up to a very\nauthentic and realistic experience.\nNevertheless, the graphical\nsplendour would be nowhere without the audio, and without a doubt\nthis is the best sounding game I\nhave ever played, and where it improves on the original. The familiar\nbut overwhelming sound effects,\nranging from the ubiquitous, booming explosions to the intricate clinking of your armour are still present,\nbut the score has now evolved into\nsomething to rival Hollywood. At\ntimes the music is minimal, and\nconsists of a simple drone or pulse\nin order to build up the tension;\nwhen suddenly thrown into the action the drums burst into life and\na fantastic mixture of strings and\nwind instruments erupt. Perhaps\nthe highlight of the score occurs\nduring the most tragic\nsections of the\ngame; the lone rescue missions and\ndaring last chances.\nOnce again, the duck-and-cover\nmechanic returns to dominate the\nsequel: gung-ho players are dead\nones, and on the rewarding but\ntense Hard setting, it is essentially\na one-shot kill environment, making\nmanic charges towards the enemy\nimpossible; however, this doesn\u2019t\nmean you\u2019ll be retreating. Several\nevents in the game require the\nGhosts to sprint across large, open\nplains or down long, undefended\nstreets in order to escape swarms\nof snipers, vehicles or mortar fire,\nand diving behind that well-earned\ncover is always followed by a sharp\nintake of air.\nThe entire single-player campaign can be completed on normal\ndifficulty in no more than ten hours,\nand by the time you reach the cinematic epilogue you\u2019ll be asking for\nmore. Fortunately, the game also\nexcels in its multiplayer: the inclusion of clans and many more maps\nthan on the prequel bolsters the\nlongevity of this game from weeks\ninto months. The various modes on\noffer include team deathmatches,\nobjective-based missions, elimination and territory-based matches,\nand are all excellent fun to play,\nparticularly when all 16 players\nare present. Sadly, there is still no\ncooperative mode for the singleplayer campaign, which is significantly better than the cooperative\ncampaign provided; however, this\nadditional campaign is still fun to\nplay. Oddly, the ability to take cover\nfluidly, an aspect so core to the campaign mode, is still absent here.\nAll in all this is not only an improvement over the original, but\na surprisingly significant one and\nfans of the tactical shooter genre\nshould once again take up arms\nand head down to Mexico \u2013 or better yet, walk down to Game and buy\na copy of the second instalment\nin the deservedly award-winning\nGRAW series.\nOh, we know. We could make the Italian Job gag. We\u2019re fully aware of it, but it\u2019s too obvious. Too nineties. So, in its place \u2013 boooooooooner\nAnother successful \u201cco-op\u201d mission\n\n"

The first floor\nspace would then be converted into\na 22m x 9m \u201cdance studio\u201d, complete with mirrored walls and a\nsprung floor.\nThe paper had already attracted\na large number of signatories,\nsimilar to the environmental policy.\nHowever, Council took issue with\ncalling the space a \u201cdance studio\u201d,\narguing that there were not enough\nmembers of dance-related clubs for\nit to be exclusive to them.\nThis was amended to calling the\narea a \u201cflexible club space\u201d that all\nRCSU Science\nChallenge awards\nclubs can use.

The new\npolicy is that clubs will no longer\nbe subsided to areas within \u201cZone\n1\u201d (defined as around reachable\nwithin 6 hours using train services)\nand will be subsidised only 16% for\nareas within \u201cZone 2\u201d (within 12\nhours of train travel).\nMark Flower, RCC Chair, raised\nconcerns over train operators refusing to carry large and bulky\nequipment (using canoes as an\nexample). Adele Peel, the policy\u2019s\nmain proposer, accepted an amendment that would allow the Clubs &\nSocieties Board to review each tour\non a case-by-case basis in order to\nexempt them under exceptional\ncircumstances; for example, if the\ndestination is unreachable except\nby air travel.\nClubs will be subsidised the cost of\na train journey, the aim being to reduce the Union\u2019s carbon emissions\nresulting from use of air travel. Ms\nPeel pointed out that, although this\nmay inconvenience clubs, a change\nin attitude is necessary in order to\nsuccessfully combat carbon contributions leading to global warming.\nContinued from front page\nTop left: \u201cKing Jad\u201d on his throne.

    "content": "Danish cinema is something that I\nimagine must be quite new to most\npeople, including myself. While\nLars Von Trier has moved to Hollywood and been brought to public\nattention, the industry itself seems\nto be pretty unknown. After the\nWedding however seems to have\nbeen advertised quite widely, given its origins, so I figured it\u2019d be a\ngood place to start learning. Sadly,\nit\u2019s not exactly a shining new force\nin World Cinema.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not\ntrashing the whole Danish film\nindustry and on closer inspection\nof the film it becomes clear why\nsome distributor thought now\nmight be the time to export in this\ndirection. The main draw here is\nMads Mikkleson, recently exposed\nto Western audiences as villain Le\nChiffre in Bond flick, Casino Royale, so now seems a sensible time\nto capitalise on his international\nrecognition. In all honesty, it\u2019s also\nthe best point of the film so it\u2019s not\nall in vain.\nAfter the Wedding sees a Danish orphanage worker (Mikkelson)\nin India invited back to his homeland to secure financing for the orphanage from a rich businessman.\nReluctant at first, he eventually\nrepents and travels to Denmark\nwhere said businessman invites\nhim to his daughter\u2019s wedding\nthat weekend to pass the time on\nhis stay. However, when he shows\nup, it seems there is more to come\nthan a certain business deal as he\nfinds his ex-girlfriend married to\nhis financier. Cue the resurfacing\nemotions, hidden secrets and family torment.\nIt does all sound a bit like an ITV\ndrama premiere but it has a slightly different style. If David Lynch\nmakes films seemingly inspired\nby LSD fuelled hallucinations, the\ndirector of this offering, Susanne\nBier, could be accused of being on\nspeed or at least a daily breakfast\nof ten espresso shots. The camera\nnever stands still; new characters\nhave 360 degree sweeps around\nthem, there\u2019s a cut every few seconds and the whole thing moves at\nincredible pace. Having not been\nintroduced to Danish film prior to\nthis, I am left wondering if this is\na national technique like the jump\ncut of the French New Wave or\nsimply one woman\u2019s inability to\nstand still.\nThis did dominate my thoughts\nthroughout the film and the plot\nseemed to move as fast as the cam-era. Anyone who said European\nfilms are dull and slow weren\u2019t introduced to this. The saving grace\nhere is the acting which shows\nsome great talent, not only from\nMadsbutfromSidseBabetteKnudsen also, playing the old flame,\nHelene. They have real chemistry\nand both fill their character with\na real sense of people with a past,\nand are matched all the way by\nHelene\u2019s husband, played by Rolf\nLassgard. This lifts it beyond the\ndreaded TV drama status.\nIn all fairness, this was an alright\nfilm. Nothing too special, but perhaps it\u2019s unfair to judge it as typically representative of a country\u2019s\ncinema. After all, when people\njudge French cinema they\u2019ll trawl\nthrough history to find something,\nnot nip off down the multiplex and\nwatch Orchestra Seats. This is\nmore of the latter I imagine and\nDanish cinema has contributed to\nthe art in the form of the Dogme\n\u201995 movement, something that was\njust overlooked here because of its\nminimalist style at a time when we\nwere obsessed with special effects-laden eye candy.\nThe highlight is definitely the\nsurprising performance of Mikkelson that can\u2019t help but leave you\nthinking he was criminally underused in Casino Royale. But then\nagain, that\u2019s one of the Bond franchise trademarks whenever it gets\na great actor. This is a much better acting showcase. Plus, any film\nthat manages to play \u201cIt\u2019s Raining\nMen\u201d twice without incurring any\nhomosexual undertones must have\nartistic ability.\nWell done Denmark.\nAfter The Wedding\nDirector: Susanne Bier\nWriter: Susanne Bier,\nAnders Thomas\nJenson\nCast: Mads Mikkelson,\nSidse Babette\nKnudsen\nOf all the categories of Academy\nAward, the one most likely to be\ngiven to the least deserving person\nis that of Best Original Score.\nThis year, for example, it went to\nGustavo Santaolalla for his work on\nBabel, a score matched in its mind-numbing blandness and formulaic\nmonotony only by the film itself, the\nonly message of which seemed to\nbe that all people are inconsiderate pricks who make stupid decisions (rather than having anything\nto do with language barriers as the\npublicity and title had led us all to\nbelieve).\nSantaolalla\u2019s previous works include the similarly unimpressive\nscore to Brokeback Mountain,\nwhich unaccountably won the\nprevious year\u2019s Oscar, and North\nCountry, whose score was so appalling as to distract from the film\nitself. Amongst other crimes, it\nmade use of the standard opening-pan-across-epic-landscape-while-the-credits-appear clich\u00e9 of a bog-standard lazy faux-epic piece with\nloud thumping beats with excessive levels of reverb and delay, the\nlikes of which only ever appear in\nfilms (almost invariably shit ones,\nat that). This sort of nonsense\nnever pervades music for home lis-tening, and with good reason - noone in their right minds would wish\nto sit down and listen to it, and it\namazes me that anyone could think\nit works in a filmic context.\nWhat makes the success of Babel\u2019s score all the more galling is\nthat one of its fellow nominees for\nthe award was Philip Glass\u2019s astounding score to Notes on a Scandal - a work which manages to be\nstriking and evocative without rubbing emotion into the audience\u2019s\nears. That such an outstanding\nwork can be overlooked in favour of\none so uninspired seems a terrible\ninjustice.\nEven then, at least it was nominated - the finest score of last year\nby a country mile, that of The Fountain, didn\u2019t even receive a nod.\nClint Mansell\u2019s profoundly inspiring score, beautifully performed by\nThe Kronos Quartet and Mogwai,\nis one of a rare few that eclipse the\nfilm for which they were composed\n(Mansell\u2019s previous work on Requiem for a Dream is another, so\niconic has that become while the\nfilm remains relatively obscure),\nyet received no recognition by the\nmajor awards other than a Golden\nGlobe nomination.\nThough it\u2019s hardly surprising that\nsuch standout works would receive\nno recognition from the Academy\nAwards and the like - John Williams,\nresponsible for a couple of hum-mable tunes over the years though\nhardly anything award-worthy, has\nthe most Oscar nominations of\nanyone other than Walt Disney and\nreceives at least one nomination\nevery year on average. Clearly, the\nAcademy values soulless bombast\nover anything truly original or com-pelling, though the general dearth\nof worthwhile scores may be in\nsome way to blame.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that many\ndirectors are accustomed to sticking to one composer for most of\ntheir scores - Gabriel Yared and\nAnthony Minghella (whose reliance\non a single composer for his scores\nwas described by one reviewer on\nRadio 4 as \u2018unique\u2019, in a startling\nsubversion of the word \u2018unique\u2019);\nDarrenAronofskyandClintMansell\n(the partnership responsible for the\naforementioned scores by Mansell);\nTim Burton and, unaccountably, the\nsuicidally twee Danny Elfman; etc.\nInevitably, variety is likely to suffer\nas a result, though some screen\ncomposers have sufficient breadth\nof style to prevent this. Williams\nand Elfman, alas, are not amongst\nDanish honeymoon can\u2019t perform\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\n\u201cI wish we hadn\u2019t picked \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d for our first dance\u201d\nHugh Stickley Mansfield these, though bizarrely enough,\nPhilip Glass is, despite the core of\nevery work of his - whether for the\nscreen or not - being comprised of\nconstant repetitive arpeggios to an\nalmost fetishistic extent. That he\nis capable of subtle differences between scores puts him above most\nother screen composers in itself,\nsince any form of subtlety is beyond\nthem.\nGiven that the films they score\nlack subtlety, this style is clearly\nperfect for them, but it certainly\nisn\u2019t worthy of recognition, let alone\nan Oscar.\nJudi comes to blows with Blanchette for humming that damn Star Wars tune, leaving Brad to save her\nThe many unsung heroes of the cinema score\n18 felix Friday 16 March 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDanish Cinema finally enters the foreign market, but the marital union doesn\u2019t look to provide eternal bliss\n\n"

Michael Cook checks the fallen\nW\nith a notable absence of half-na-ked women promoting games,\nand writers from\nevery fansite on the internet, the\nGames Developer Conference 2007\nwas reduced to the main components of every great media conference \u2013 wild speculation, unbounded\ncriticism, and cries of doomsday.\nMaybe it was the absence of E3,\nmaybe it was the presence of the\nPS3, whatever it was has made the\nGDC\u2019s latest event a high-stakes\nevent, with a lot of fresh announcements coming through followed by\nthe inevitable slew of criticism and\ninternet \u201cdebate\u201d.\nOne moment Nintendo were stifling all online development, the\nnext they announce their first on-line-enabled title will be out before\nWinter of this year.\nFirst we get news that a Spore developer thinks the Wii is \u201ca piece of\nshit\u201d and suddenly he\u2019s playing the\nDevil\u2019s Advocate card to an internet\nfull of angry, oversugared gamers.\nI don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s\nbeginning to scare me. The whole\ndamn industry is beginning to\nscare me. Nokia will be releasing a\nthird incarnation of its NGage, and\nMicrosoft\u2019s Zune \u2013 an mp3 player\neven less suited to gaming than the\niPod \u2013 will potentially be gaming-capable in its next incarnation.\nAnd, of course, the big news of\nthe conference \u2013 the Playstation3\u2019s\nHome technology, allowing users to\ninteract with each other in a virtual\nworld, with a virtual house, virtual\nclothes and presumably a virtual\nPlaystation3. It\u2019s like Second Life,\nbut without some people dressed\nas cats.\nWell, presumably. No-one actually\nposed that one to Phil Harrison after the announcement.\nBut \u2013 and I know, I know this story comes up every year \u2013 the most\ntroubling undertones in the conference came from a relatively low-key\npanel discussion on the future of\nPC Gaming.\nEveryone\u2019s always spelling the\ndemise of the big grey box, and it\nstill remains strong today, but the\npanel \u2013 composed of developers\nFiraxis, Epic, XBox LIVE and others \u2013 instead suggested that PC\ngaming may fade into obscurity,\nrather than be bullied out of the\ncommercial ring.\n\u201cPC gaming is in a state of transition,\u201d explained EA\u2019s Richard Hilleman, who went on to say that PC\ngaming was being developed for\n\u201cniche\u201d gaming.\nHe would know \u2013 the top five PC\ngames of the moment are all from\nthe Sims franchise, and two of the\nremain- ing five are also EA ti-tles. But he wasn\u2019t\nstupid \u2013 PC gaming hadn\u2019t devolved into the\ncasual mire\nthatPRwas\nMichael Capps, who said it \u201ckilled\u201d\nEpic to have to make Unreal 3\nmultiplatform, but that PC gaming\nwas simply \u201cfalling apart\u201d. What\u2019s\nchanged?\niD seem quite confident of what\u2019s\nchanged \u2013 their CEO, Todd Hellenshead, gave a lecture on software piracy at the GDC, explaining\nthat it was this that pushed iD into\nmultiplatform development. Epic\nand iD, originally two of the PC\u2019s\npremier developmers, forced onto\nconsoles because of rising development costs.\nAnd the kicker, as Capps pointed\nout at the panel \u2013 \u201cShooters are\ndoing well on consoles now.\nNobody thought that\nwould happen.\u201d\nBut to place the\nblame on BitTorrenters alone\nwould be a little foolish. The\nsimple fact is\nthat PC Gaming doesn\u2019t know\nwhat its doing.\nIt\u2019s the gaming equivalent of a\nCommunist state \u2013\nand a poorly governed\none at that.\nIf someone wants to make\na first-person shooter, they\nmake one and it gets published.\nThere\u2019s no quality control, no\nhive mind, no organisation \u2013\nunlike consoles, with the\ntop-down organisation\noffered by the likes\nof Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony.\nGames For Windows attempted to\ngroup PC Games\ntogether, but Microsoft are unable to\nclaim the platform as\ntheir own in any\nmeaningful way,\nand even if they\ndid it may be too\nlate, with the platform in such disarray and the media\nso split on what the PC\neven means.\n\u201cThe thing we really needed [in Fable] ... is love\u201d Molyneux explains. Cheers, Pete \u2013 but does anyone care?\n\u201cI\u2019m the most nervous I\u2019ve ever\nbeen in my career,\u201d Lionhead\u2019s Peter Molyneux told gaming website\nKotaku last week. \u201cI\u2019ll show [the\njournalists] this feature and they\nwon\u2019t get it. They\u2019ll turn around\nand say, \u2018OK, what about the big\nweapons?\u2019\u201d\nWhereas publications like PC\nGamer, websites like The Escapist, and new-games-journalists like\nKieron Gillen or Jim Rossignol all\nattempt to evangelise the fringes\nof PC gaming and the \u201climits\u201d that\nare being pushed by the more audacious developers, the public seem\nless sure, and are wary of getting\ntoo close to their humming grey\ncuboid. Magazines such as Edge\ngive it an ivory tower aftertaste,\nand make the simplicity of consoles\na more comfortable prospect.\nAnd on the other hand, you\u2019ve got\nMolyneux\u2019s dilemma, dealing with\nthe rest of the media who only want\nto see the big, the loud, and the\nimpressive.\nBack to the panel, they discuss\nDEFCON and the steps it took to\nchange the strategy genre. Did it\nsucceed because it went art-like\nand shook things up?\n\u201cThe great thing about DEFCON\nwas its shape,\u201d said Firaxis\u2019 Soren\nJohnson. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to start making medium-sized\ngames on the PC, because the PC\ncan do that. It\u2019s that flexible.\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that the\ndeath of the PC would be a beneficial step for gaming, moving the\nfocus to sharply-designed, well-im-plemented hardware and a better\nsense of gaming community.\nBut looking back on the last decade of innovation in games design,\none thing seems worryingly evident\n\u2013 most things began on the PC.\nIt turns out that the PC\u2019s saviour will also be its biggest money\nchurner \u2013 MMOs. They can\u2019t be\npirated, they can\u2019t be sold on and\n\u2013 currently, at least \u2013 they\u2019re extremely poorly implemented on\nconsoles.\nBut it feels like a last defence, a\nfalling back to the online redoubt,\nnow being advanced on by LIVE,\nHome, and a battalion of Miis.\nA software pirate. A-haha. It was funny when they used it in the adverts and it\u2019s funny now. Shut up\nclaiming it had. What the media call\ncasual gamers are actually playing\nin excess of twenty hours a week.\nWhat saddened me the most was\nthe opinion of Epic\u2019s\n24 felix Friday 16 March 2007\nGAMES felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Global Warming? Sounds good...\nSunshine\nDirector: Danny Boyle\nWriter: Alex Garland\nCast: Cillian Murphy,\nMichelle Yeoh,\nChris Evans\nFrom the pen of Alex Garland\ncomes the spiritual successor\nto the sleeper hit 28 Days Later\n\u2013 Sunshine \u2013 a story of salvaging\nhumanity from a seemingly inexorable extinction. As his first major success raised the bar so high\nfor storytelling, the key question\nregarding Sunshine is this: can it\nbreathe new life into the science-fiction genre in the same way his\nfirst did for the horror genre?\nThe story itself is unprecedented\nin its topic: our Sun is reaching the\nend of its life, and a scientific expedition is sent to the centre of the Solar\nSystem in order to deliver a payload\nthat will \u2013 theoretically \u2013 reignite\nthe star. What follows appears to\nbe an amalgamation of all previous\nscience-fiction sub-genres, molding\naction, suspense and horror into\ntwo hours; in this sense it does not\nat any point generate anything surprising or unseen, but the Alex Garland-scripted space opera exhibits\na distinct flair for dark storytelling\nand emotive cinematography that\ndeserves to be applauded.\nSurprisingly, the two hour time\nslot does not allow for much character development, with the focus\nbeing kept primarily on the pace of\nthe story and the atmosphere; despite this slight disappointment, the\nfocus is clearly on the conditions\nthese astronauts are surrounded\nby and, more importantly, the decisions they have to make.\nHowever, despite the lack of character development the audience is\nstill able to bond with each of the\ncrew members and their collective\njourney to the Sun, which increasingly looks like a one-way trip. When\ntragedy begins to befall the charac-ters, you cannot withhold your sorrow as the excellent, emotive and\nsuitably surreal score kicks in; the\nabsolutely stunning and terribly\nlifelike CGI effects engulfing the\ncharacters at points like these are\nbeautiful to behold but at the same\ntime terrible to watch.\nThe predictably tragic yet endearing storyline continually spirals out\nof control and into an abyss of despair until up to half of the screen\ntime is devoted to the psychological breakdown of each of the crew\nmembers; however, the film, despite\nits darkness, is always injected with\noptimism from time to time, usually\nfrom a character\u2019s revelations or\neventual course of action, leaving\nthe viewer with a spark of hope despite the unfolding horrific events.\nWhether it was by design or not,\nby not having a great deal of in-depth character introspection the\nissue of survival is not focused on\nthe individual crew members but on\nhumanity itself, and several references to our indigenous home world\nand the importance of this mission\nrepeatedly, but by no means annoy-ingly, reminds the audience of this\nfact, and it pays off incredibly well.\nThe Sun is represented here as\nthe creator, the origin of all life on\nEarth; whenever it is onscreen the\ncharacters never see it as anything\nless than the utmost hallowed of\nuniversal presences, even if they\nare staring death right in the eye.\nAt various points during the sci-ence-fiction epic our scientists and\nastronauts are frequently lost in its\nbathing luminescence, and the CGI\nis implemented so successfully that\nRobert Andrews\nthe audience finds it hard to avert\ntheir glare either.\nThe atmosphere generated by\nthe simply breathtaking effects, the\nsweeping score and the excruciatingly tense and minimalist use of\nthe sound effects would be nothing\nwithout the superb cinematogra-phy; innovative, often provoking\ncamera angles that only reveal part\nof the scene to the audience and\ncontinuous shots not unlike those\nseen in the Oscar-winning thriller\nChildren of Men are perfect for\naccumulating a nail-biting atmos-phere, particularly during the ex-tra-vehicular spacewalk scenes.\nWhat Sunshine indubitably does\nbest is convince you throughout the\nentirety of the story that you are\nbeside these astronauts, confined\nwithin the gigantic but claustrophobic Icarus-II; not until the very\nend, when the perspective is finally\nremoved from the Sun and focuses\non our very own Earth, does this effect really hit home, finally releasing you from the self-incarcerating\nconditions imposed by this dominating vessel.\nWith a well-chosen cast, including an unsettlingly-fearless Cillian\nMurphy (28 Days Later, Batman\nBegins) as the onboard Physicist,\nand a welcome return to western\ncinema for Hiroyuki Sanada (The\nLast Samurai) as the expedition\u2019s\nrighteous commander, this film exudes quality, and despite the lacking\ncharacter depth, the atmosphere\nalone is worth the viewing price.\nSunshine is a truly mesmerising\nfilm, proving once again that director Danny Boyle and scripter Alex\nGarland are two bright stars in the\nvast swathe of Hollywood hotshots.\nLong may they survive.\nCillian Murphy ignores the age old advice not to look directly at the Sun. Or touch it\nScully finds there\u2019s more than truth out there\nStraightheads\nDirector: Dan Reed\nWriter: Dan Reed\nCast: Gillian Anderson,\nDanny Dyer\nIf you are partial to movies that fail\nto fully answer the questions they\npose, where the main characters\nare never fully developed and the\nplot is a loose construction that\nwould collapse under the slightest\nscrutiny, you are going to have a\nwhale of an 80mins watching Dan\nReed\u2019s .Straightheads.\nStarring the familiar (surely everyone at IC watches sci-fi?) Gillian\nAnderson [The Last King of Scotland] as Alice and Danny Dyer [The\nFootball Factory] as Adam, this atmospheric and sexually charged\nthriller describes a chance meeting between two young lovers and\na posse of rugged men, intoxicated,\nhigh and ready to mete out some\npain and suffering.\nAdam and Alice meet while he is\ninstalling her new alarm system.\nThey are a bit of a mismatch; she\nis a confident, beautiful business-woman, while he is a young Cockney lad, unsure of himself and\npainfully ready to follow her lead.\nHowever, there is enough chemistry evident on-screen between\nthe two to ensure that they are not\nwholly unconvincing as a couple.\nAfter attending a lavish party in the\ncountry, Adam and Alice speed off\nthrough a desolate forest in the early hours of the morning. They come\nto a sudden, grinding halt when Alice\u2019s Benz wraps itself around an\nunsuspecting deer/elk/mammal of\nyour choice. While Adam is outside\ninvestigating the damage, a sinister looking Jeep pulls up and some\nmen disembark. Not that threaten-ing, you\u2019re thinking? Just wait\u2026\nUnfortunately for Adam and subsequently Alice, these are the same\ngroup of men who she earlier overtook on the way to the party and\nwho Adam vociferously swore at. In\ntheir present inebriated state, the\nonly thing on their mind is to beat\nhim to within an inch of his life.\nThis scene is not for the squeamish\nand while Tarantino it is not, I still\nfound myself cringing with each\nblow. Leaving Adam prone on the\nground, the men move on to Alice,\ntheir lust for violence not yet sated.\nIf I told you that this scene is one of\nthe main reasons why an 18 certificate has been placed on this movie,\nI am sure you can infer the invasive\nmanner in which they abuse her.\nAfter this most horrific encounter,\nthe two drift through life together\naimlessly, unable to forget those\nwho left her with severe emotional\nscarring and him with the use of\nonly one eye. How appropriate then,\nthat while Alice is visiting the rural\nabode of her deceased father, she\nglimpses a familiar face; it is Heffer, one of the men who forced himself so cruelly upon her. When she\ntells Adam, they conclude that they\nmust take some sort of revenge - an\neye for an eye, as it were.\nThe second half of the movie is\nall about the tension and expect-ancy, but will they be able to bring\nthemselves to commit brutality\nthat few understand like they do?.\nThe somewhat abrupt ending left\nme relieved, rather than intrigued\nor wanting more. Straightheads\nnever fully capitalises on its poten-tial: too much is left unsaid and the\neroticism that pervades the whole\nmovie feels somewhat forced. The\nlink between violence and sex, excellently delineated in movies such\nas Angel Heart and Leaving Las\nVegas, is never really made here\nand one cannot help wondering\nwhat the point of this whole exercise was.\nTo conclude, I guess it was watch-able, but you\u2019re better braving David Lynch\u2019s Inland Empire.\nPatrick Tumilty\nGillian fears her hair won\u2019t cut it for the 100 Sexiest lists this year\n20 felix Friday 16 March 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis Easter, Danny Boyle will put science in the shade, and make the world crave those extra two degrees\n\n"

    "content": "Core blimey! Flipping magnetism!\nField reversals in a vat of molten sodium reproduce the irregular behaviour of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\nOne of the thornier problems in\nunderstanding the Earth lies far\nbeneath its surface, in the core,\na region shrouded in mystery. As\nMIT\u2019s David J. Stevenson pointed\nout in a somewhat off-the-wall letter (about which more later) to\nNature in 2003, mankind has sent\nspace probes 6 billion kilometres\nfrom Earth, yet the far greater energies involved travelling through\ndense matter rather than a tenuous\nvacuum partly explains why we\u2019ve\nonly succeeded in drilling down to\n10 km \u2013 barely scratching the surface \u2013 to learn more about what lies\nbeneath our feet.\nAs a result, to understand the\nprocesses which govern zones such\nas the core, geophysicists rely on\na combination of remote sensing,\nsimulations, theory and guesswork.\nEmploying these, they infer that\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field originates\nfrom motions of the molten iron\nwhich makes up much of the core.\nDynamo theory aims to explain how\nthe motions of this electrically conducting fluid can generate currents\nand hence associated magnetic\nfields, which interact with themselves in a complicated fashion,\nresulting in a roughly dipolar field\nfor the Earth \u2013 as if it contained a\nbar magnet. At present this is oriented such that the Earth\u2019s north\nmagnetic pole lies in the southern\nhemisphere. This is why a compass needle indicates north \u2013 opposite magnetic polarities attract\neach other, so the compass needle,\na magnetic north pole, seeks out\nthe south pole of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, located (confusingly)\nin the northern hemisphere, presently somewhere north of Canada\u2019s\nmainland.\nTo make matters worse, not only\nis this location known as the Magnetic North Pole, but every couple\nof hundred thousand years or so,\nthe Earth\u2019s field reverses direction.\nEvidence for this can be seen in\nplaces like the Mid-Atlantic ridge:\nas out-flowing magma cools, it\n\u2018freezes\u2019 the field direction at that\ntime into itself. Going from the ridge\ncentre outwards (from newer rock\nto older), a succession of bands of\nrocks containing oppositely directed magnetic fields are seen. From\nthis, it\u2019s inferred the Earth\u2019s field\nhas switched directions abruptly\nmany times in the past.\nComputational simulations have\nbacked this up, but in a recent article in Europhysics Letters, following up work reported in Physical\nReview Letters in January, a team\nfrom France\u2019s ENS reports they\u2019ve\nbeen able to observe field reversals\nin a physical simulation as well.\nBerhanu et al filled a large copper cylinder with 160 litres of liquid\nsodium, chosen as it conducts electricity and has a low melting point\n(98C). Using counter-rotating iron\npaddles at each end of the cylinder\nto generate a turbulent flow, the\nScience: changing the public\u2019s perception\nScience: a series of cogs working\nmechanistically and reductively; a\nsystematic study of the nature and\nbehaviour of the material universe,\nbased on observation, experiment,\nand measurement; the formulation\nof laws to describe these facts in\ngeneral terms. Can one conclude,\nlike Keats, that scientific understanding takes away the beauty of\nthe rainbow?\nWith the growing mistrust evident\nin an unforgiving and frequently\nsceptical society, some representations of science have become weak\nand flawed. In this 21st century scientific and technological advances\nare perceived by some as a threat,\nscientists merely working as amateurs playing God, running all that\nis natural off-course and directly\ninto the grave.\nIn this plagued vision, nanotechnology eats away at reality; robots\ninherit the earth; genetic modification defines \u2018perfection\u2019; diseases\nare cured but not prevented; and\nthe powers of the scientific mind\nhave fallen deep into the shadows of\ncorruption. As the pessimism parasite infects, disreputable scientists\nin the public eye come to represent\na majority, scientific progress apparently becoming the bane of our\nexistence.\nIn today\u2019s world, science and society meet in an arena that is ten-tative, uncertain and sometimes\neven hostile. It is therefore important that the perception of science\nis handled with care. If negative visions are to be associated with sci-ence, will it ever flourish?\nIn order to change the tainted image of science, one needs firstly to\nunderstand that science is owned\nnot by scientists, but by society.\nOne must recognize that scientists,\nas the \u2018caretakers\u2019 of science, not\nthe possessors, are only one link in\na social chain of politicians, economists and social planners jointly\ndeciding whether scientific practices are going to harm or benefit\nsociety. The decaying foundations\nof trust must also be rebuilt, with\nscientists openly and modestly\naddressing the taboos of science;\nembracing the downfalls, the er-rors, the missing links and most\nimportantly answering questions\nof doubt. The journey that lies between research and eventual public\ndelivery of scientific discovery must\nalso be highlighted, marking the obstacles placed by rigorous regulatory practices. \u201cTo every action there\nis an equal and opposite reaction\u201d\n\u2013 learning from the words of Isaac\nNewton one must see that the momentum of science will always be\nharnessed by forces of control.\nWith honest communication, appropriate engagement, and dia-logue, the relevance and positive\nimpacts of science in our everyday\nlives can be demonstrated. The\ngolden promise of science can be\ngiven the opportunity to shine.\nIn a vision of colour, scientists can\nbe valued as they dedicate their\nlives to pioneering research on neglected diseases of the developing\nworld. In the light of nanotechnology (working with objects that are a\nmillion times smaller than the milli-metre), new electronic devices and\ndrug delivery systems are set to\ntransform medicine. With a potentially revolutionary ability to repair\ndiseased and damaged body tissue,\nstem cells may offer hope to those\naffected by cancer, diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nIn this brighter picture, explaining something in a scientific way\ndoes not diminish it but rather, like\nlearning of the complexity of our\nbrains, stimulates a fascination and\nappreciation for our extraordinary\nexistence.\nSo let the cogs of cognition and\nscientific discovery keep on turning.\nLet the oceanographer venture into\nteam was able to generate a statistically stationary magnetic field\n(i.e. centred around a well-defined\naverage value), as others have before them. The breakthrough came\nwhen they investigated the effect\nof altering the speeds at which the\npaddles rotated. At certain values,\nthe resulting field reversed direction at irregular time intervals,\nmuch as the Earth\u2019s field does.\nThe resemblance extends further,\nhowever, as the time taken for the\nA \u201csolid, ironical, rolling orb\u201d or a dense, ductile and malleable\nspheroid? Depends who\u2019s looking. (Photo: J. Caldwell, Dublin 2005)\nthe uncharted 95% of our oceans;\nlet physicists continue to work with\nelectrons, positrons and mind-bog-gling quarks in order to learn more\nabout the building blocks of our uni-verse. As geneticists pore over the\nthree-billion-letter long genomes of\nhumans and mice, let us paint the\nimage of a science that searches\nfor a solution, solving rather than\ncreating the problem. Let the astronomer search our skies for new\nworlds, landing remote-control-led vehicles on comets to excite\nour curiosity. Let the geologists\ntell the world of the 1,000-foot-tall\nunderwater volcano coloured with\nmicrobial life. Let us support the\nenvironmentalist and their efforts\nto save the ozone layer. Let the\narchaeologist illuminate Ancient\nEgyptian manuscripts using NASA\nimaging technology in an attempt\nto make greater sense of our civili-zation. Let us interpret more effectively the true meaning of science\nand the scientist.\nIf our scientists and society can\nhand-in-hand nurture science, addressing as a priority the challenges and controversial moral, ethical\nand social issues, then the vision\nof science can undergo a transfor-mation. Rather than a machine of\ndeception and destruction, science\ncan be perceived as a remarkable\nsystem of dynamics, sensitively\nworking in order and motion to\nexplore the Universe around us.\nScientists and communicators can\nawake the beauty of science, inspiring us all.\nJenna Caldwell\nScience is\nowned not by\nscientists, but by\nsociety\nexperimental field to reverse direction was always much shorter than\nthe time the field spent in a particular orientation. Again, this reproduces behaviour seen at Earth:\nreversals take place over hundreds\nor thousands of years, but on average stay in a particular configuration for several hundred thousand\nyears, as mentioned above. Overall,\nthese similarities, and others not\ndiscussed here such as excursion-like signatures, suggest this experiment provides a good model for the\nEarth\u2019s core.\nShedding light on this remote\nregion may well require getting\nhands dirty with experimental investigations such as this. However,\nthere\u2019s a limit \u2013 the aforementioned\nStevenson\u2019s call-to-arms, as some\nreaders may recall, proposed driving sensors down cracks generated\nby vast quantities of iron, melted by\nan atom bomb. A vat of molten sodium suddenly seems a lot tamer.\nAge of the Earth\u2019s ocean-floor crust, red is young. As new rock cools, it records the magnetic field at the\ntime.

After Brixton\nI shall scuttle off to Highbury &\nIslington to the Silver Rocket\nclub-night where October All\nOver, Underground Railroad,\nThe Sailplanes, and Epideme are\nplaying at the Buffalo Bar. Whilst\nall of this is happening, the fantastic Raccoo-oo-oon will be playing at Barden\u2019s Boudoir in Stoke\nNewington. I recommend you go\nto at least one of these gigs, but\ntwo of them might be sold out\nsoon so turn up early. Go now!\nI am blabbering on about all\nthese good gigs and bands so as\nto counter-act my recent appear-ance. I have probably seemed\nmalevolent in my distain for all\nnew bands cropping up, but I am\nsick of all these fads cropping\nup. I want the good old days (the\n90s) where bands had tunes and\nsustainability, but the millennium\nhad to come along and so all\nmusic now has to sound \u2018progressive\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019, like all this\nnew vacuous architecture. Maybe\nwe have reached the pinnacle of\nhumanity and ideas of the 21st\nCentury are wishful thinking.\nEven though those of you who listened to and loved Funeral (myself\nincluded) will probably have bought\nthis album anyway, I thought I'd\nwrite a little something about this\nalbum. It is Arcade Fire's second\nalbum, but I fear will be labeled forever as the 'follow-up' to Funeral for\nyears to come. Want to know why it\nwill be eternally lamented this way?\nWell, it just leaves me with this void\nwhere emotions should be. What\nmade the Arcade Fire so adorable\nwas the fact that they were grandiose but retained a subdued aesthetic and production value, now\nthey have indulged in the grandiose\nleaving me feel like I have just listened a Bruce Springsteen album.\nIf you have ever seen the film High\nFidelity, then this album should\nhave felt like the scene where our\nprotagonist is in dialogue with The\nBoss, but instead this LP was the\nawful dance moves of Courteney\nCox in the video for Dancing in the\nDark.\nThat first sentence may not have\nmade much sense I guess, but then\nthat is true for a lot of things that\nI say. I remember on the cool kids\ncircuit a lot of those people who disliked the Arcade Fire were those\npeople who just saw them as a poor\nimitation of Mercury Rev or Modest\nMouse but with a gothic aesthetic\nrather than subdued Mid-Western\nArcade Fire\nNeon Bible\n(Merge Records)\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nalbum reviews US cool. Despite all of this doubt-ing, I still maintain that Funeral is\na gorgeous album full of brilliant\nsongs that have only a shallow similarity to the aforementioned bands.\nFuneral was introspective yet outgoing in its optimism and childlike\nwonder, it was intricate yet minimal\nin its portrayal so as not to blur the\nmelodies and as mentioned it was\ngrandiose whilst retaining an organic lo-fi edge all oozing melodies\nand rhythmic punch. These contradictions and walking the fine line\nbetween dramatics and genuinely\nmoving seem to have been lost and\nthe line is reduced to a smear. They\nare a band suffering from a lack of\ndefinition, and this comes across\nin the obscure attacks upon government such as in Black Mirror\n(\"Show me where them bombs will\nfail\"), and the re-recording of No\nCars Go which appeared on their\ndebut EP\n.\nSpeaking of vague attacks on the\ngovernment, this album reminds\nme of Radiohead's dire and forgettable effort, Hail To The Thief\nwith its lack of invention and lack\nof tunes. The songs on this album\nare okay but they are just that; the\ndrums are utilitarian which isn't refreshing just boring and the chord\nsequences are obvious with no\ndrastic changes in structure or progression in the songs. I mentioned\nBruce Springsteen earlier and this\ncomes across via his dull album\nTunnel of Love which is so middle of\nthe road that it is a splattered squirrel with skid-marks across it (listen\nto Keep The Car Running). When\nthe stadium rock is toned down as\nin Neon Bible, the repetition of the\ntitle just annoys and I find myself\nskipping through it.\nThis album is frankly a disappointment and I can't help skipping through it until I get to some\nof the songs Regine sings, but not\neven her quirky yet ultimately appealing French hybrid singing can\nAfter two albums of moping and in-trospection, Patrick Wolf has finally\nfigured out how to write pop songs\nand it turns out he's pretty fucking\ngood at it. Of course, The Magic\nPosition still has a few moments of\ntedious balladry thrown in for those\nlosers who actually listen to what\nhe's singing about, but on the whole\nthis album is packed with the kind\nof fun and energy only seen in such\nconcentration on a handful of tracks\nfrom his previous albums.\nOpening track Overture puts a\nheavy emphasis on strings, which\nplay a major role throughout much\nof the record and I could go on\nabout how lush and exciting the\ninstrumentation is throughout, but\nfor most people listening the most\nimportant thing by far is going to\nbe Wolf's guttural crooning, which\nsounds more likely to have come\nPatrick Wolf\nMagic Position\n(Universal)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nfrom a 7000-pound rhinoceros than\nthe gangly 23-year-old pictured on\nthe cover. His voice never quite\ntakes on the raw animal energy\nencapsulated in songs like Tristan\nfrom previous album Wind In The\nWires, but that is really a consequence of the more poppy nature of\nThe Magic Position and his voice is\ncertainly never without presence.\nReturning for a moment to the\ninstrumentation, what impresses\nmore than any particular instrument is how Wolf blends live and\nelectronic elements, with synthesizers working their way into a host\nof tracks and some very interesting arcade machine samples turning up on Get Lost (as well as a\ntheremin).\nThe main highlight of the record\nhas to be the title track, soon to be\nreleased as a single, which exemplifies Wolf's new poppier direction;\nwith its uplifting strings, playful\nhandclaps and stomping feet, this\nis a song you could actually dance\nto! Other strong points are opening\ntrack Overture, singalong friendly\nAccident & Emergency and the\nbouncy fairground anthem Get\nLost.\nWolf unsurprisingly doesn't go\nwrong with the slower numbers\neither, such as the quite listenable\nukelele and piano led ballad Augustine, if you like that kind of thing (if\nyou liked his previous albums then\nyou probably do). Even the bizarre\nnoise-experiment Secret Garden\ndoesn't seem overly out of place\nhere \u2013 even though it may have\nbeen more at home in the darker\nterritory of his earlier work \u2013 and it\nserves as a subtle reminder of how\nhe has evolved musically.\nWhen you consider that Patrick\nWolf is only 23, it's hard not to be excited about what he might have to\noffer in the future, but for now this\ndelightful collection of pop songs\nwill have to do.\nAlex Baldwin\nsave how formulaic the Arcade Fire\nhave become. After losing members\nand family through death, they dug\ndeep with purpose and produced\nFuneral, now after that success and\nadding members they have become\nstable, and ultimately complacent.\nBasically, when they're singing or\nperforming, I don't feel like they\nmean it and this makes it hard for\nme to take the time to absorb this\nalbum in its entirety over time.\nThey must try harder.\nMatty Hoban\nTwo gloomy sets of visages that could do with hugs and snuggles: Arcade Fire (left) and Patrick Wolf (right)\n12 Friday 16 March 2007\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix\nR\n\n"

After two years\nof misery for the Medic\u2019s they must\nhave come into this year\u2019s event\nconfident of victory after the IC\nMedic\u2019s 1st and 2nd XI\u2019s having\nsuch a good year over the IC Hunk\nXI.\nIC 3rd\u2019s played IC Medic 1st\u2019s in\nthe second fixture of this academic year. After a tense first half the\ngoals started flowing and IC 3rd\u2019s\nfound themselves 2-1 up late in sec-ond-half injury time. This was the\nmoment in which this years Medics\nmade their mark in Medic football\nhistory by amazingly equalising\nand therefore avoiding defeat to a\n\u201cstunningly good looking\u201d IC 3rd\nXI.\nFrom there the Medic\u2019s year got\neven better as in both IC Medic\n2nd\u2019s vs. IC 3rd\u2019s \u2018The Hunks\u2019 fixtures the Medics pulled off the feat\nof only losing by one goal on both\noccasions after getting dominated,\nand some would say toyed with by a\nrampant Imperial side. In fact they\ncould in future be labelled perhaps\nthe best Medic 2nd XI of all time by\nmanaging to score a goal against\nImperial opposition. Only time will\ntell.\nOur esteemed 1st XI captain Pat\n\u2018We Won the ULU Cup\u2019 Beef then\nrightly decided that instead of playing the Medic 1st XI with 5 men and\nhimself being blindfolded he would\nlet the IC 2nd and 3rd XI\u2019s take over\nand deliver the expected trouncing.\nThe IC 3rd XI lined up against\nthe Medic 2nd XI, briefly laughed\nthen went out in the first half and\ndelivered a football master class.\nPossession was easily maintained\nthroughout the team and shots\nrained down on the Medic goal. After hitting the crossbar and the post\nin quick succession Scott Greening\ndelivered a wonderful corner where\na Sam Rickards flick only narrowly\nmissed the target. Up front Matt\nGready pushed around Medic defenders at will and was unlucky\nnot to be awarded a penalty due\nto a lazy challenge by the Medic\ncentre-back. The highlight of the\nSuccess at BUSA Cross Country Championships\nJames Blyth\nmatch then came when the Medic\nmidfield put together four passes in\nsuccession, which was alluded to by\nthe Medic captain later in the second half when he asked his team to\n\u201cplay like they did in the first-half.\u201d\nThe second half was a lower key\naffair with passing becoming difficult on a pitch that became increasingly cut-up. Chances were limited\nto long range efforts, although an\nIC 3rd shot was cleared off the\nline late on by some decent Medic\ndefending.\nBy the final whistle a few of\nthe Imperial boys could stand no\nlonger, which was not due to physical exhaustion but fits of laughter.\nAn innocent remark by the Medic\nCaptain where he asked his boys\nto \u201crun, run you heart out, run like\nyou\u2019ve never run before,\u201d was immaculately timed a provided a lift\nto a slightly dejected 3rd XI who\nfelt dissatisfied at wasting so many\nfirst-half chances. A point apiece\nleft the IC 2nd XI needing only a\ndraw to reclaim the Football Varsity\nCup for the third year in a row.\nThe 2nd XI vs. Medic 1st XI was\na high quality affair. The 2nd XI\ndefence this year has been phenomenal and with the leadership\nof Richy Parasram and the experience of former captains AK, Dave\nJai and Vanni Mariggi the club was\nmore than confident that our 2nd\nXI could get a result over the Medic\n1st XI.\nObviously the Medics didn\u2019t lie\ndown and they put in some heavy\ntackles. But in the end their cause\nwas not aided by having a ginger\nhaired midfielder and they were\neasily beaten by goals from Jack\nBritton and Deji Akiboye. Deji,\nhimself a Medic, had decided earlier in the year to play IC football\ninstead as \u201cplaying for the Medics would harm his footballing CV\nirreparably.\u201d A choice well made\nand a fantastic result for the 2nd\nXI saw the Football Varsity Cup retained and the footballers went on\nto Richmond and sang their hearts\nout for our much loved egg-chasing\nfriends.\nThe weekend started well when\nwe survived the attempted murder\nby the University of London, who\nmanaged to hire a coach driver who\nthought it sensible to reverse down\na motorway against oncoming traf-fic; a coach driver who also half way\nthrough the journey asked if anyone had brought a map with them.\nDespite this incompetence we finally arrived at our luxury hotel in the\nmiddle of nowhere.\nThe first race of the day was the\n11.9km mens race which also incorporated the World Cross Champs\ntrials. Imperial was led in by an outstanding manner by Wynne Evans,\nfinished 82nd overall.\nShortly after came Miguel Branco, in 109th with a solid performance in his last BUSA XC. 127th\nplace was Ed Pitt Ford in a formidable demonstation of front running\nfor the first lap (of many), with the\npeople\u2019s champ Chris Mullington\nnot far behind in 162nd. 10 places\nback was Sven wearing spikes that\ncaused foot sized blisters, a real\nteam player.\nLast home for the team was Allan\nwho stopped on route a couple of\ntimes for an ice-cream break \u2013 apparently the cornettos were pretty\ngood.\nUnlike the University of London\nall our runners managed to complete the race. Imperial came 21st\nout of the Great British Universities an excellent effort for our debut\nperformance, and something that\ncan be built on in future years.\nThe second race was the Womens\nrace of about 6.7344567621km, again\nincorporating the World Championship trials. The first Imperial run-ner, Harriet Scott, finished 8th in an\nincredibly strong field, an awesome\nachievement and the most outstanding performance of the day.\nSecond home was Angharad Care,\nwith a gutsy run to finish just out\nof the top 100 despite little training.\nMaking up the rest of the team was\nwomen\u2019s captain Harriet Kirk, with\nLucia and Sabine on their debuts\nfor Imperial and Emily who ran\nstrongly, exceeding her own expec-tations. No doubt the best female\nXC team Imperial has ever had.\nThe final race of the day was the\n8km Mens B race. The lead runner\nfrom Imperial being club captain\nLeo Murray. A few places behind\nwas first year Dave Blundell, surely\na name for the future. Not long after\ncame Christophe, and club star Rob\nDone, better known for bar exploits\nthan actual running. Making up the\nrest of the team were Beit Boy Tim,\nWes \u2018that was just my warmup\u2019 Briscoe, Aaron Mason and the legendary Tarik, making an all too rare\nappearance. The team came home\nin 19th.\nThe weekend was topped off by\na party hosted by Bath University\nwho very kindly let theiving scumbags ULU use their photocopier to\n\u2018purchase\u2019 extra tickets.\nMany thanks to Accenture, Sport\nImperial and Tutorlink (www.tutor-link.org.uk), who made this weekend possible.\nEd Pitt Ford and Leo Murray\nRed player to goalie: \u201cDoes this smell weird to you?\u201d Goalie: \u201cLook, just piss off, will you? I\u2019m trying to stare intently at this football.\u201d\nThe Cross Country musical statues championship gets off to a good start\n\n"

However, this did not\ndampen Imperial\u2019s spirits and they\nquickly bounced back with some\ngreat attacking lines and often\nbreaking through the medics defensive line, before a last ditch tackle\nstopped the attack. This pressure\ncontinued from the forwards and\nthe backs, with some fierce tackles coming from both sides, but\nthe poor pitch conditions hindered\nany aggressive forward play whilst\nthe backs had better fortune with\nNathan Alliston and James Alford\npersistently breaking the line. Finally Jo Brown found a gap in the\ndefence and scored a try under the\nposts for Imperial, giving them a\nthe lead at 7 - 3.\nWith the Medics going behind,\nthe pressure from their large pack\nincreased, however the Imperial forwards were not ready to let\nthem simply walk to the line and\ndefended with all their might. However, with the first half drawing to\na close, the Medics finally got the\ntry from a rolling maul off a lineout,\nwhich the forwards were unable to\nstop leaving the score at half time\n10 \u2013 7 to the medics.\nThe second half saw much of the\nsame from both teams; attrition in\nthe forwards and superb attacking lines from the backs, carefully\ntargeting the Medics weakness on\nthe wings. Unfortunately, all of this\npressure could not be converted\ninto any points, due to some great\ntackling and some foul play in rucks\nand mauls by the Medics. A try did\ncome, however it was the Medic\npack that managed to get it from a\nvery dangerous scrum just off the\nImperial try line towards the end\nof the game, where the Imperial\nfront row collapsed and the referee\nallowed play to continue over them\nas they walked over the try line.\nWith the game drawing to a close,\nthe pressure increased even further from Imperial until finally the\nMedics foul play caught up with\nthem as their scrum-half was sin-binned, giving Imperial a 5 minute\nwindow to mount a strong attack.\nHowever it was not to be and the\nfinal score stayed at 17 \u2013 7 to the\nMedics, giving them there fifth win\nof this competition.\nThis year saw yet again a hard\ncontested game, with the Medics\njust edging to victory towards the\nend of the game, something JPR\nwas more than happy to point it\nout. However every year the competition does grow from strength to\nstrength and the teams always provide an exciting game for everyone\nto watch.\nFinally a great thank you has to\ngo to the players that are leaving\nnext year, especially to the captain\nMichael Hicks, who throughout his\n6 years at Imperial has given everything he has to he club, but his body\non the more line on more than one\noccasion, and will be sorely missed\nwhen he graduates. Thank you guys\nand good luck.\nVarsity Rugby\nImperial 1st XV 7\nICSM 1st XV 17\nJovan Nedic\nFor the 5th year in a row the IC boys had to settle for runners up medals; the medics took home the cup\nEMERSON VIGOUREUX\n\n"

This time,\nthey\u2019re going to integrate Xbox\nLive with Vista, allowing PC gamers to play all sorts of games with\nour console brethren. It\u2019s a fairly\ngood idea, if it weren\u2019t for one fac-tor: consoles suck (see above).\nThe Good\nThere are a handful of games that\nPC gamers might want to play from\nthe Xbox 360. Burnout comes to\nmind, as does Splinter Cell. Gears\nof War and Halo 2 would be a good\nlaugh, if only to once and for all\nprove the superiority of keyboard\nand mouse over gamepad. The\nservice brings little else to the fray,\nas PC gamers are largely unwilling\nto settle for less and use Microsoft\u2019s\nservices \u2013 a point already proven\nby the long-dead Microsoft Gaming\nZone.\nThe Bad\nConsole games are limited by slow\ncontrols, which means shooters are\nout. This leaves racing, fighting and\nRPGs. Console RPGs tend to be\nsingle-player, so they\u2019re out. Racing\ngames, well, the PC has something\nfor everyone. Burnout seems like a\nfew laughs, but with excellent simulations like GT Legends, why settle\nfor less? Even if you\u2019re after explo-sions, you\u2019ve still got Flatout on the\nPC. And fighting games have been\npopular on the PC, well, never.\nAnd all this without mentioning\nthat Xbox Live costs money \u2013 cold,\nhard cash \u2013 to use what is basically\na tiny subset of the Internet. And\nwho\u2019d want to pay to play simplified\ngames against people who haven\u2019t\nyet realised that their consoles need\nto be dusted off with a baseball bat?\nFootnote \u2013 Live! on the PC? Over my Dead! body\nThe PC has seen worse wars than this, says Sebastian Nordgren, and it\u2019ll get the last laugh now too\nT\nhis is a rant. I\u2019m telling\nyou this so that you don\u2019t\nread the first half and\nstart fuming at the unmitigated crap I will no\ndoubt be spewing by then. Why am\nI ranting? Because consoles suck.\nI could care less if Merrill-Lynch\n(thanks for the free food!) predicts\nthat 1 in 3 US households will own\na Wii by 2010. It\u2019s still a useful statistic though, since that means that\n1 in 3 households contain at least\none bell end. Probably more, if you\ncount the Xbox 360 \u2013 It\u2019s So Revolutionary, It\u2019s Going In The Same\nDirection! \u2013 and the PS3.\nWhy do I hate consoles? I mean,\nI did have those amazing gaming\nexperiences at the age of 8 on my\nbrand-spanking-new NES, and experienced the indescribably fantastic Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\non the Nintendo 64. However, I di-gress. Consoles suck because they\ncannot in any way, shape or form\ndrive the design of games forward.\nThe truly revolutionary games of\nrecent years (Darwinia, Defcon, N,\nMorrowind, etc.) were not designed\nfor consoles. Consoles, all of them,\nare adept at sucking the complexity\nout of any game.\nCompare the fantastic Deus Ex to\nits successor Invisible War \u2013 instead\nof the subtle UI, complex inventory\nmanagement and slow, meaningful\nbionics upgrade choices, we get a\nmassive HUD with a crosshair the\nsize of a basketball, a leveling and\nupgrade system that gives you everything you wanted in the first 3\nhours and one type of ammo. One\ntype of ammo. For rocket launchers and shotguns and dart guns!\nIt\u2019s not an isolated incident by any\nmeasure, and as more and more\ndevelopers aim for multi-platform\nlaunches, the people suffering are\nnot just PC gamers, but gamers in\ngeneral.\nThe excellent Baldur\u2019s Gate series was turned into a repetitive\nhack\u2019n\u2019slash in Dark Alliance, Halo\nwas bought by Microsoft and turned\ninto a slow-paced shooter where\nenemies stand still for up to half a\nminute, just waiting for you to shoot\nthem. It\u2019s a terrible trend, and the\npeak of console gaming is still far,\nfar less original than PC classics of\nover 5-6 years ago. No One Lives\nForever, Battlefield 1942, and HalfLife redefined shooters on the PC,\nonly to have Bungie sell more units\nthan any of them because they\nmade a game with all the depth of a\npuddle on an average London day.\nThe things that differentiate console games from their PC counterparts are not clever design\ndecisions to challenge the player,\nthey\u2019re simplifications to cope with\na shite control system and a screen\nresolution less than half of what\nPC gamers have been running for\nyears. Even 1080p, a standard that\nis well out of the reach of most con-solers, has already been surpassed\non the PC. Games like Grand Theft\nAuto and Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater,\nwhich sold silly amounts on every\nconsole, flopped on the PC \u2013 not\nbecause the game itself was worse\n\u2013 but because PC gamers expect\nmore. More variety, more depth,\nmore complexity, more customiz-ability \u2013 just more.\nIn fact, I\u2019m willing to go so far to\nsay that consoles are nothing but\na glorified home arcade machine.\nThe games that sell so much on\nconsoles are graphically updated\narcade classics. Metal Slug, Street\nFighter, Gran Turismo, Dance\nDance Revolution \u2013 these are all\ngames that used to be played at\nlocal arcades in some very similar\nrendition. A console is little more\nthan a way to pay a one-off \u00a3300\ninstead of 20p every 10 minutes to\nplay those fun, yet ultimately point-less, games in the comfort of your\nown homes.\nWith all this talk of the \u201cconsole\nwars\u201d, there really does seem to\nbe only one solution \u2013 force everyone onto the PC. Every console is\ndevolving into an underpowered\nPC anyway, with boot menus, operating systems and internet browsing coming built-in, so I fail to see\nwhere the shoe pinches. Abandon\nyour artificial constraints and contrived design decisions and join the\ntrue gaming revolution \u2013 the PC.\n\u201c... I\u2019m willing to say that consoles are\nnothing but a glorified home arcade machine ...\u201d\n25\nfelix\nFriday 16 March 2007\nGAMES felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Lollipops, lots of pink-fla-voured flamboyancy and a gigantic monkey, the stage was set for\nwhat turned out to be more of a\nshow than any kind of gig I\u2019ve ever\nexperienced.\nMika, the Beirut-born London\nbased pop sensation, made famous\nfor his single Grace Kelly (which\nironically places the music industry in a wholesomely negative light)\nperformed his entire album at the\ninfamous Koko venue in Camden.\nEven at the beginning of his ca-reer, the Freddie Mercury dead\nringer has amassed a huge fan\nbase, and it is fairly easy to see\nwhy. Pop music, as it is generically\ntermed, is often bland, unoriginal\nand seriously unimaginative. Mika\nhas injected a serious overdose\nof happy juice into the dwindling\ngenre, and tonight he brought his\nalbum to life, not to mention raising\nthe roof at Koko, a venue primarily\nfocusing on indie music.\nFrom the opening jumper Love\nToday to the more piano-led tracks\nsuch as My Interpretation and Over\nMy Shoulder, he showed a surprisingly impressive range in vocal\nstyle and musical composition, and\nhis perpetual bouncing around the\nstage, accompanied by the quite enjoyable lyrics themselves, he successfully made a hard-line progressive rocker smile; this, I guarantee\nyou, is incredibly rare thing for pop\nmusic to accomplish.\nThe support band were as much\na part of the act as the man of the\nhour himself, with some brilliant\nguitar riffs increasing the energy of\nthe already hyperactive songs, particularly the catchy Billy Brown,\nwhich was accompanied by two additional brass players, to add some\nblaring instrumentality to the proceedings to great effect.\nThe entire performance was delightfully camp but was at no point\nin your face; you couldn\u2019t help being\nswept up by the motion of it all. The\nsongs themselves were all completely unique, and each developed\nits own unique character, all thanks\nto the charisma of Mika and his impressive vocal range, which even\nlive seems physically impossible.\nThe man must have vocal chords\nthe size of a single mini-cheddar.\nThe only let down was the dura-Claimed by many to be one of the\n\u2018up and coming\u2019 bands for this year,\na band described as playing \u2018incessantly catchy pop, like Blur, or\nFranz at their giddy best\u2019, well decide for yourselves.\nMade up of four people, Phil (vo-cals, rhythm guitar), Beal (Bass),\nRoz (drums), and co-writer and cofounder Sulli (lead guitar) from the\nMidlands! We caught up with the\nband for a chat, in the Shepherd\u2019s\nBush Empire where we find them\nhaving a couple of drinks.\nSo you\u2019re here at the empire supporting the Kaiser Chiefs, How did\nthat come to happen? Are you enjoying the tour?\nYeah, its great. They picked us actu-ally, their drummer came to see us\nwhen we played in London a while\nback. The next day we were told\nthey wanted us to support them.\nThey where doing a DJ set on Zane\nLowe\u2019s show a couple of weeks ago,\nand they played our single (LOCK\nUP YOUR DAUGHTERS) as the 1st\ntrack.\nHave many other bands been support alongside you?\nThe 1990\u2019s, there\u2019s two bills rotating\nbetween each night, us and them\nare on the same night. Really nice\nguys.\nHow far through the tour are you\nnow? Is there any night in particular you enjoyed playing?\nThis is the 5th night now and we\nhave another two to do. All the\nnight have been good, but Manchester, the 1st date was the best\ncause it the 1st massive gig we\u2019ve\never done, The adrenaline alone\nmade it the best.\nDo you find may people know who\nyou are?\nNot really on this tour, it sold out so\nfast everyone is a hard core Kaiser\nChief fan! But we supported the Pigeon Detectives earlier in the year,\nand loads of people knew our single\nthen. But those gigs attract the kinda \u2018new music\u2019 fans.\nSo you\u2019ve had one single out with\nyour current record (1965) did you\ntry to release anything yourselves\nfirst?\nNot really no, we did a couple of\nsmall demos and stuff but everyone\ndoes that. Nothing major, even this\nsingle was only on limited release,\nit was just to get the name out there\nreally. We were lucky cause it was\nput on a NME CD and a rough trade\ncd, that helped a lot. It get quite a\ngood reaction when we play it now.\nYou got an album in the works?\nThe albums finished, we\u2019ve just\ngot to mix it now. I always thought\nthat when u record an album, u just\nrecord it in and there, its done. But\nthere\u2019s loads to do to it to get the\nsounds right after. Ian Broudie from\nthe Lightning Seeds is producing it\nwith us, he\u2019s done The Coral and\nthe subways already so.\nGood fun to work with?\nYeah, great, the nicest guy you could\nmeet kinda thing. Yesterday we had\na day off so we just went round to\nhis house and chilled out a bit. Wandered around Portobello road market and watched a bit of Harry Hill.\nHe\u2019s really good with new bands,\nonly really does first album, apart\nfrom The Coral. He just eases you\ninto it, very keen to keep the \u2018live\nsound\u2019 on the album. You got your\ndeal through what you sound like at\nthe start so you should need to piss\naround with the 1st album.\nSo when can we expect the\nalbum?\nThere\u2019s a single out at the end of\nApril I think, our first full release,\ncalled My Precious Valentine then\nthe album should be out at the end\nof the summer.\nDid you all help write the album?\nPhil (Wallbank, lead vocals and\nrhythm guitar) writes most of the\nstuff on an acoustic guitar, then he\nbrings it to us and we each add in\nour parts ourselves. Every one is\npretty in tune with how the song\nshould go, no ones trying to take\ncrazy bass solo\u2019s where they don\u2019t\nfit or anything.\nDoes the album have a name?\nNo, not yet. We\u2019ve been thinking\nabout a few but you tend to just\nthink about in jokes that we find\nhilarious but no one else would get.\nIf you think about it most album\nnames are crap until the album really get known. Like Modern Life by\nBlur, what a terrible name! But because it becomes known as a good\nalbum and the name is associated\nwith it, its ok. As long as we don\u2019t\ncall it Ripchord it\u2019ll b fine.\nSo you where signed by James\n(Endeacottt (1965 records)) in\nwhat, august?\nNah, May, just before the A-levels.\nSome of us had exams and the other\u2019s went travelling. So we didn\u2019t\nget anything going for a while, but\nthat partly because we weren\u2019t good\nenough really, needed more prac-tice. We did the 1st few album tack\nat the end of august then had a gap\nwhere we did nothing but practice.\nSo its been a pretty interesting\nyear for you all then?\nYeah, I mean it doesn\u2019t seem like it\ncause we\u2019ve been doing it an we\u2019re\nabout to play Shepherd\u2019s Bush, but\nif you\u2019d said that to us a year ago it\nwould have been mad. IT doesn\u2019t\nseem weird at all though.\nAre you playing any festivals over\nthe summer?\nYeah hopefully, We\u2019d love to play\nGlastonbury, Reading, Leeds, but I\nthink they only sort out the smaller\nbands later on, we just want to go 2\nGlastonbury really.\nHave you all registered just in\ncase?\nErm, when\u2019s the last day you can?\nTomorrow, are you going to any\nothers? Oxygen has an interesting\nline up.\nNot sure, not a big fan of the Chillis\nand there was a rumour they would\nplay.\nAt this point the band descend into\na rant about which bands they really don\u2019t like, too loud for us to\ncatch everything, except that they\nare not big fans, to say the least\nof both the Red Hot Chilli Peppers\nand Bloc Party. Coming back to the\ninterview:\nSo a year from now, what would\nyou like Ripchord to be doing?\nWe\u2019d really like a song in the charts,\nas you go on your aims get bigger.\nA year ago we just wanted to release a single. Now we\u2019ve done that\nwe want to be in the top 40, an in a\nyears time maybe a headline tour\nwith fans going nuts to the songs.\nI think when you hear one of your\nsongs played in the background of a\nsoap like \u2018eastender\u2019s\u2019 you\u2019ve really\nmade it.\nFinally the band leave to do their\nsound check and we consider how\nnot to get ejected from the backstage area without passes. Ripchord are genuinely one of the\nfriendliest bands I\u2019ve met and their\nsongs aren\u2019t exactly shabby. Keep\nan eye out for that single at the end\nof April.\nSam Lombard\nInterview with up-and-coming Ripchord\nMika\nKoko\nlive review tion of the performance, which was\nsadly, approximately, only one hour.\nNevertheless, with only one album\nout and literally at the start of his\ncareer in the eyes of the public, he\ncan be excused; his excellent per-formance, which stands out from\nany other pop act around the UK\ntoday, more than makes up for it.\nWhatever child-like inhibitions\nthat were being held in by the audience were unleashed during the\nanimated conclusion to the set, Lollipop, which saw the release of such\na vast quantity of vitreous confetti\nit could have filled the entire Royal\nAlbert Hall. Everyone was either\nleaping into the sky to intercept as\nmuch of it as possible as if the Crystal Maze had returned, or stood\nthere and slowly became immersed\nin it. By the time Mika walked off\nthe stage, hundreds of people were\nassaulting each other with masses\nof the glittery confetti, with some\nbeing uncomfortably placed inside\nsome unfortunate places.\nI remain impressed by this significant entry into the UK music\nscene even after the glittery, ec-stasy-mimicking performance had\nfaded into memories. Still, despite\nmy tiredness and complete and utter disorientation I seem to have\nexperienced tonight, I could walk to\nKoko from here: I just have to follow the confetti trail leading from\nCamden to South Kensington. That\nstuff\u2019s like gold dust to the most immature of minds.\nRobin George Andrews Mika amongst a load of rubbish and some balloons\n\n"

Yes, I am the first sports editor to\nhave put a medic on the back page, and no, I am not proud of it!\nFULL REPORT ON PAGE 31\nIC retain hockey cup\nAfter much deliberation over the\nevents of the annual showdown\nwith our arch nemesis, more commonly known as the IC medics the\nfollowing recollection of events was\npieced together:\nHaving seen the ladies 2s and\nmens 2s draw and win respectively,\nit was the turn of the ladies 1s to\ncontinue to momentum in favour\nof IC. Having met the medics once\nbefore this season, and successfully\nretained the ULU cup for the second\ntime the previous Sunday, IC were\ngoing into the match confident.\nHowever, this was not to be demonstrated from the offset, with IC\ngiving balls away cheaply, not closing down players, nor moving towards the ball. It was only when the\nmedics drew first blood, yet again\ndenying the team their first clean\nsheet of the season, that IC girls\nwoke up and started playing the\nhockey they are capable of:\nWe came straight back with a\nstonking solo effort from our beloved captain, Moony. Once in our\nstride everything started to go according to the books, and we were\nlooking comfortable at half time.\nHowever it is not IC\u2019s style to do\nthings the easy way, and in a horrible case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu the medics\nscored a few goals bringing them\nonly one goal behind IC. It did also\nseem that the umpire was doing his\nup most to upset IC\u2019s rhythm; sin\nbinning Clayton, telling our crowd\nto quieten down, and generally making decisions in the medics favour.\n(Someone has to like them!- Ed)\nIC did their up most to hold on to\ntheir slender lead, when they should\nhave perhaps carried on playing\nmore attacking hockey. And in due\ncourse, with 5 minutes to go, IC\nwere punished, with Spanner finding herself in a one on one situation.\nCleanly taking the ball and admittedly a bit of the player, the umpire\ndeemed it dangerous play and she\nwas duly sin binned and the medics\nawarded a penalty flick! (The incident has, less kindly, been called\nthe dirtiest two-footed challenge\noutside of a football pitch-Ed).\nAt 5-4, this meant that medics had\na high chance of equalising.\nHoward, more commonly known\nfor crunching defenders outfield,\ndecided to take on the responsibility of donning the goalie\u2019s kit and\nstepped up to the challenge, receiving a few hasty coaching tips from a\nrather tipsy ladies 2\u2019s keeper.\nThere was an eerie silence whilst\nthe flick was being taken, despite\nHoward diving the right way, there\nwas just enough power to get the\nball in the back of the net.\nOnly minutes remained of the\nmatch, all square at 5-5, both IC\u2019s\npride and reputation were at stake.\nFrom the push-back, IC attacked\nand found themselves in the opponents D once again, with grit, deter-mination, a never say die attitude,\nand much scrapping IC eventually\nscored!\nThe final whistle shortly followed\nwith the team celebrating a victory\nthat ensured IC retained the hock-ey, varsity cup aswell as the ULU\ncup victory at the weekend.\nVarsity Hockey\nImperial Ladies 1sts 6\nImperial Medcals 1sts 5\nMyra Sae-heng\nThe medics won the rugby but met their match in the hockey\nIC and medic ladies clash sticks in a close Varsity encounter\nxkcd www.xkcd.com\nHallucinations Kitties Wikipedia\n\n"

    "content": "Steve Jones, professor of genetics\nat UCL, says that most science is\npart of the entertainment industry.\nIf a scientist can\u2019t \u2018sell\u2019 the idea of\ntheir research to the public, they\nwill struggle. This is certainly true\nof Jones\u2019s own research into the genetics of snails, an esoteric subject\nif ever there was one. But some science has clear benefits and doesn\u2019t\nneed to be sold. Medical research\nhas a surprising ability to enthuse\nthe public, judging by the number\nof column inches devoted to it in\nthe broadsheet press. At least one\nscientific paper a week offers an\ningenious new approach to tackling\nan old disease. In recent months,\nthere have been a number of new\nadvances in diabetes research.\nThe two main forms of diabetes,\ntypes 1 and 2, are life-long afflictions characterised by high blood\nsugar levels. Patients with type 1\ndiabetes are incapable of producing insulin, a hormone that controls\nblood sugar levels, and must go\nthrough the inconvenience of daily\ninsulin injections to remain healthy.\nInsulin pills would provide a more\nconvenient method of replenishing insulin levels but remain a pipe\ndream; insulin breaks down when\nexposed to stomach acid. But in\nDecember 2006, a team of Chinese\nscientists produced a working insulin pill. Their work was published\nin the journal Biomacromolecules.\nThe key discovery was that a natural component of shrimp cells could\nsurvive in stomach acid. The scientists fashioned tiny capsules from\nthat component and filled each\nwith insulin. The microscopic pills\nwere robust enough to survive in\nthe stomach of lab rats but small\nenough to pass into the bloodstream\nand lower the blood sugar levels of\nthe test animals. What works for\nrats may work for humans in the\nnear future.\nOf course, a better treatment for\nThe sweet, sweet smell of success?\nA tantalising whiff, as various teams worldwide make headway in understanding and treating diabetes\ntype1diabeteswouldinvolverepair-ing insulin production in the pan-creas. Arguably the most impressive recent research into this area\nwas announced in the journal Cell\nin December. It has always been assumed that diabetes is a disease of\nthe immune system, caused when\nwhite blood cells attack the insu-lin-producing cells in the pancreas.\nA team of Canadian researchers\nsuggested a second possibility, that\ndiabetes is a disease of the nervous\nsystem. They noticed abnormalities\nin the pancreatic nerves of diabetic\nmice. When the scientists removed\nColin Barras\nthe abnormal nerves, the mice immediately began to produce insulin.\nHealthy nerves produce a pancreatic neuropeptide that controls the\nproduction of insulin, but abnormal\nnerves produce too little of the neu-ropeptide. The team found they\ncould also cure diabetic mice by\nboosting the level of neuropeptide\nthrough injections. And one injection can keep a mouse healthy for\nmonths. In humans, the equivalent\ninjection could restore health to a\ndiabetic for several years.\nThese results suggest that type 1\ndiabetes may become less of an inconvenience in the future. But what\nof type 2 diabetes? This form of the\ndisease results from insulin resist-ance, which leaves the body less\nable to react to variations in blood\nsugar levels. The disease is common in the overweight. As obesity\nbecomes more prevalent across the\nwestern world, the instances of type\n2 diabetes are on the rise.\nTreating type 2 diabetes might be\nas simple as encouraging the body\nto release more insulin to counterbalance insulin resistance. A joint\nChinese-USA research team published a paper in PNAS in January working on this principal. They\nfound a molecule, called Boc5,\nwhich encouraged rats and mice\nto release more insulin and combat\nthe effects of type 2 diabetes.\nAnother approach is to identify\nand neutralise the agents that help\nbuild up insulin resistance. In a\nstudy published in Cell Metabolism\nlast week, an American research\nteam discovered that the fat molecule ceramide increases the risk of\ninsulin resistance in rats. A strain\nof rats predisposed to develop type\n2 diabetes ordinarily show signs of\ndisease after ten weeks. When the\nscientists treated the rats with a\ndrug to stop ceramide production,\nnone of the rats developed insulin\nresistance or diabetes.\nBut prevention is better than\ncure. A team of Imperial research-ers, working with colleagues in\nFrance and Canada, made headlines last month by mapping the\ngenes which put people at risk of\ndeveloping type 2 diabetes. Their\nresearch, published in Nature,\npromises to allow the development\nof a genetic test to identify those at\nmost risk of developing the disease\nlater in life. \u201cIt is very possible to\nprevent diabetes even if your father\nis diabetic, but it needs good advice and possibly medication,\u201d said\nProfessor Philippe Froguel, a senior researcher on the project, via\nemail. The research also suggests\nthat the mutations which increase\nthe risk of type 2 diabetes were at\none point advantageous to human\nhealth. \u201cThe theory says that these\ngenes were very beneficial when\nwe had little to eat and much to do\nto find our food,\u201d continued Professor Froguel. \u201cThese genes support\na thrifty metabolism increasing\nfat storage, which is not good in a\nsituation of overeating and obesity.\u201d\nFurther proof that type 2 diabetes is\nvery much a disease of the modern\nworld. Even so, advances in medical research may soon render it a\ndisease of the past.\nA group of scientists from the University of North Carolina have found\na gene that increases the number\nof sexual partners men will have by\n80-100%. They also discovered this\n\u2018horny\u2019 gene will make teenagers\nmore likely to lose their virginity\nat a younger age, and to gain more\npleasure from sex with a larger\nnumber of partners. There is no\nsimilar gene in females, statistically\nlikely to have fewer sexual partners\nthan men. The study, carried out at\nthe University of North Carolina,\nused more than 2500 individuals including siblings of both sexes. The\nresults were adjusted for a range\nof socioeconomic factors, and same\nresults were found across different ethnic groups. It was published\nin the highly respected European\nJournal of Human Genetics.\nThis pre-determined promiscuous tendency, passed down from\nyour parents, is far more common\nthan the \u2018faithful gene\u2019 which leads\nto fewer sexual partners and less\nimmediate pleasure from sex outside of a loving relationship.\nYoung adults have more sexual\npartners than any other age group,\nand those who sleep around will\nhave a significantly higher risk of\ncontracting STDs, including HIV.\nWith HIV cases worldwide rapidly\nincreasing, finding what drives\nyoung people to sleep around is\nvitally important to help curb the\nspread of this deadly virus.\nEvolutionary advantages for\nmen who had lots of sex include increased fitness, as well as making\nthem more likely to pass on their\ngenes. Sex increases muscle tone\nand aerobic fitness, both important\nadvantages in finding food and escaping predators. Women had no\nfitness benefit attached to having\nmore sexual partners, while the\nrisk of them getting pregnant meant\nthey chose partners who would stay\nand help with the burden of raising\nchildren. Socially, it is far more acceptable for men to sleep around,\nand encouraged in many societies\nas proof of how manly that person\nis \u2013 obscurely, also making them\nmore attractive to many women.\nThe gene involved is for a protein\ninvolved with dopamine receptors,\nthe same receptors stimulated by\namphetamines, cocaine, and other\nillegal and addictive drugs. It is\nthought sex stimulates this receptor more in men who have the gene,\nacting as a \u2018reward\u2019 for deviant sexual behaviour, making it addictive\n\u2013 men with this gene quickly \u2018learn\u2019\nto get this reward by seeking out\nmore sex.\nIt was found 9 out of 10 have this\ngene, meaning many men may\nuse it as an excuse. The message\nto women is clear: keep an eye on\nyour man \u2013 the urge to stray is in\nhis genes!\nMen \u2018designed\u2019 to cheat\n9 out of 10 men have a \u2018horny\u2019 gene that increases promiscuity\nLizzie Murdock\nYouch \u2013 neuropeptide injections cured diabetic mice. But could human diabetics be injected elsewhere?\nWould you trust this man?\n4 felix Friday 16 March 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The perceptive among you may be guessing I am going to say the Kissaway\nTrail's debut album is a Lada, well I\nam not, because at least a Lada has\nsome function, while this piece of\nmusical mush is a lie, a complete,\nhideous, Danish lie.\nBut why I hate the Kissaway Trail\nmay not be immediately apparent\non first listen to the album. There\nis nothing wrong with the band, the\nmusic is likable, the songs are lush\nand developed, thoughtful lyrics\nand organ are all there but why do I\nhate this band so? Because they are\na complete fucking rip of the Arcade\nFire \u2013 just with more cheese. Forever Turned Out To Be Too Long, the\nopening track, could be mistaken\nfor an Arcade Fire cover band and\nthe following Smother+Evil = Hurt\nis equally as misleading.\nIf you have never heard the Arcade Fire then you\u2019re safe, you\nwill probably like this album, it is\nrelatively easy going and twee, the\ntwenty somethings who make up\nthe band can certainly play their instruments and put together songs\njust not ones which are original.\nProps to the band as they have successfully captured and mimicked\nthe sound of their Canadian idols\n\u2013 even the accent! Let\u2019s just hope\nthey realise the music is about originality sometime soon. Oh, but they\ndo have a nice art direction.\nNick Simpson\nB2K were the urban *NSYNC.\nMassively popular for no apparent reason. Okay they could they\ncould bust a choreographed move\nor two but that still doesn\u2019t explain\nwhy teen girls went gaga over\nthem. Their material, like that of\n*NSYNC\u2019s, was pretty generic so it\nis still a mystery how they managed\nto shift so many albums.\nFronted by moderately talented\nsingers, the boys cashed in on the\nboy band explosion of the nineties\nbut only the lead singers, Justin\n(*NSYNC) and Omarion (B2K),\nmanaged to survive the boy band\nmassacre of the early noughties.\nThis makes Omarion the Justin\nTimberlake of R&B.\nUnlike Justin, Omarion hasn\u2019t\nstruck platinum with his second\nsolo offering, yet. Lead single, Entourage, was incredibly weak and\nvery few got to hear it before it sank\nwithout a trace. Luckily, his second\nsingle off 21 isn\u2019t half bad. In fact,\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m admitting this\noutside the safe confines of my bedroom but it is pretty darn good.\nLike JT, Omarion has called in\nbeat extraordinaire, known to you\nand me as Timbaland, for the pro-Omarion\nIce Box\n(Sony)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nalbum review\nduction so it nothing short of in-credible.

He is\npretty clever in his use of Ice Box as\na metaphor for a guarded heart and\nhe tackles heartache from a new\nperspective.\nIt is a little more subtle in its brilliance compared Justin\u2019s My Love\nbut it gives us a glimpse of how\nmuch better My Love could have\nbeen if the singer had a little more\nvocal ability.\nKeep an eye out for Solange, Beyonce\u2019s little sister, in the video.\nJemil Salami\nFantasia can sing her butt off.

But now it is time\nfor her to tackle the second item on\nher to-do list in her evolution from\ntalent competition winner to recognised and acclaimed recording artist \u2013 make a breakthrough album.\nThe second album is usually the\nbeginning of the end for reality talent competition winners-that is for\nthose who manage to make it that\nfar. Trying to forge a career in the\nmusic industry after winning a show\nlike American Idol becomes even\nharder.

She capped a\ngreat year off by winning two Grammy awards \u2013 one from right under\nMariah\u2019s nose. No doubt Fantasia is\nhoping for similar success with the\nrelease of her first single from her\nsophomore album. Album number\n2 is her chance to show the world\nshe has what it takes to be vital to\nthe music world and if it bombs it\nis going to take a miracle to get her\ncareer back on track, much like the\nmiracle required to save Jade\u2019s\ncareer.\nFortunately for her, and let\u2019s face\nit for us too because you can never\nget too much good music, it doesn\u2019t\nsuck. Hood Boy is a juiced up slice\nof urban pop driven by a Supremes\u2019\nsample (The Happening). It is a\nshout-out to men everywhere in the\nsame vein as DC\u2019s Soldier and possesses the boisterousness of Christina\u2019s Ain\u2019t No Other Man. It is a\nloud and fun cut which will plague\nyour mind for days after you first\nhear it.\nJemil Salami\nalbum, Saturday Night Wrist, the\nsingle is fun and catchy, well as fun\nand catchy as one of the founding\nfathers of nu-metal breed can get.\nThis is certainly no 7 Words or\nPassenger but Mein cuts its own\nniche and is identifiably in its own\nright, something that cannot be said\nfor the releases of many other rock\nveterans (I'm look at you RCHP).\nThe track clocks up only five or so\ndifferent lines but the draw of the\nthrashing melodys and bare drum-mings is as strong as ever.

The hapless hero George\ngoes about saving the world\nin the kind of nonchalant manner you might expect to see if\nDavid Mitchell was tasked with\nsaving the world.\nBroken Sword is a joy to play\nfor a lot of reasons. It predates\nthe hypersuccessful Knights\nTemplar cash cow by at least\nfive years, for one thing. But\ngames of Broken Sword\u2019s genre \u2013 one very close to extinction\n\u2013 always remind me of gaming\nbefore people fussed.\nI\u2019m not one of those people\nthat think modern gaming is a\ntravesty compared to the 8-bit\ndays. I\u2019m as glad to have Civ IV\nand C&C3 as much as I am to\nhave the originals. But games\nlike Broken Sword show a more\ncomfortable industry, when the\ngap between the gamers and\nthe makers was less.\nThe last fortnight in gaming\nhas been racked by infighting\nand mudslinging, with the GDC\nproving to be the spark for a\nwhole new wave of console de-bate. And after the discussion\nabout the usefulness of the PC,\nit\u2019s interesting to talk to old\nstalwarts \u2013 now turned over to\nthe consoles, unhappy with the\nrepetition and sloppiness of PC\ndesign standards.\nTake a look at our take on the\ndebate this week \u2013 a report on\nthe opinions of the GDC, as well\nas a slightly more ... opinionated view. Is the PC platform dy-ing? Or will games like Spore\nand DEFCON keep it in place\nas the home of innovation?\nIf you\u2019ve got some spare cash\nhanging around, you might be\ninterested in our look at Ghost\nRecon AW2, too. It\u2019s games like\nthis that show the intensity that\nconsoles offer, but is it just the\nfamiliar blowing shit up?\nWhen Felix returns next\nterm, we\u2019ll have a retro flavour\nto the proceedings \u2013 probably\npicking up on Broken Sword\nand its ilk at some point. Should\nthe PC ever finally cop it, I\u2019ll be\nthere at the funeral. I\u2019ll say a\nfew words about the laughs we\nhad, and how it sold itself out to\nget in with the kids, and OD\u2019ed\non Sims expansion packs at\na crazy party. And then we\u2019ll\nplant a copy of Monkey Island 2\nin the front garden, with a little\nplaque.\nAnd I\u2019ll pay a little kid to kick\nthe XBox in his crotch.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n22 felix Friday 16 March 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week in videogaming\nO\nriginally, there was\nsome confusion as to\nwhy the PSP hadn\u2019t\nbeen included in\nthe Playstation3 announcements of the GDC. This\nweek though \u2013 if rumours are to\nbe believed \u2013 there\u2019s a good reason\nfor it, namely a successor to Sony\u2019s\ndark handheld slice. The PSP 2.0,\naccording to the gaming blog Kotaku that broke the story, claim that\nthirdpartyinsidershavebeenprom-ised a second console, and that an\nannouncement may come as early\nas this year\u2019s E3 event. There\u2019s the\nstandard claims of better screen\nand faster loading times, but what\u2019s\nreally caught our eye is the possibility of a built-in camera and \u2013 oh-oh\n\u2013 a built-in touchscreen?\nIt\u2019s unlikely to emerge for a while,\ncertainly not before the Playstation3 debuts its Home software, the\nsocial networking platform that will\nplay host to all of Sony\u2019s matchmaking shenanigans. Dubbed by Nintendo a \u2018Mii too\u2019 attempt, Sony has\ndefended their ideas, saying that it\ngives a far wider and more social\nrange of things to do, not to mention the suggestion that this technology had been in development\nfor some time. Home\u2019s closed beta\nbegins in late summer with it going live worldwide before the year\nis out. There are fears that it might\nimpose upon gamers that aren\u2019t so\ninterested in the new technology,\nbut Sony\u2019s Phil Harrison seems\nconfident that it\u2019ll become as key\nto the Playstation3 as Live! is to the\nXBox 360.\nPhil does his best.\nWhat would be your Top 10 of influential games? This just in \u2013 noone cares any more.

The curator at Stanford\u2019s\nScience and Technology museum\nhas compiled the top ten of key vid-eogames, and the choices might\nseem a little odd. Some \u2013 such as\nCivilization or Doom \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be\ncontested by many gamers. Others smack a little of obviousness\nGuns, football, and Communism \u2013 the three ingredients in the modern game?\nFrom top \u2013 Doom, Sensible World of Soccer, and Civilization, three of the most influential games ever?\n(Spacewar!) and some \u2013 Sensible\nSoccer \u2013 are slightly questionable.\nBut agree or disagree, Mr. Lowood\nis doing some interesting things\nwith the Museum, petitioning the\nLibrary of Congress and seeking to\npreserve the history and culture of\nvideogaming in the future. Perhaps\nexhibitions like Game On won\u2019t be\nso uncommon in the future?\nAnd since this is our last issue before the launch of the Playstation3,\nwe should point out that the bundles\nare very varied, and if you\u2019re hoping\nto get one early on, you should shop\naround. \u00a3555 spent at Game will get\na 60Gb, Call of Duty 3, Resistance:\nFall of Man, and Motorstorm, but we\nlike Play.com\u2019s pack \u2013 \u00a3525 will get\nyou a 60Gb model with Resistance,\nMotorStorm and Genji \u2013 not a bad\npackage, especially when you take\ninto account the bundled HDMI.\nReleases this week are yet again\ngood news for gamers \u2013 SSX Blur\nfor Wii owners, the long-awaited\nand much-hyped Spectrobes for the\nDS, as well as the new Bomberman\nTouch, and our personal favourite\nfor this week \u2013 the sequel to Phoenix Wright \u2013 Justice For All, with\nmore excuses to shout into your DS\non the Tube.

    "content": "David Lynch is one filmmaker guaranteed to polarise an audience. As\na reviewer, he can be simultaneously a dream and a nightmare,\nmore confusing than even his films\nat times. He is the avant-garde of\nthe mainstream if you forgive the\nparadox and three hours of Inland\nEmpire is certainly enough for you\nto decide which side of the fence\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nyou lie on. Assuming Lynch doesn\u2019t\nchallenge your perception of what a\nfence really is.\nThe plot of Inland Empire goes\nlike this: Nikki Grace (played by\nLaura Dern) is a Hollywood ac-tress, ready to make a massive return to the top with her new film but\nsoon finds herself falling for her costar despite being married already.\nAs it becomes known to her that the\nmovie is a remake of one that was\nnever previously completed under\nmysterious circumstances, things\nbegin to take a bizarre twist and\nthen, erm, well, yeah\u2026 After this\njust go with the flow, whether it be\nup, down, sideways, whatever.\nIf you aren\u2019t aware of David\nLynch and his work you won\u2019t really\nappreciate how weird it gets after\nthat. If however you\u2019ve seen, for ex-ample, Mulholland Drive, you\u2019ll appreciate exactly where I\u2019m coming\nfrom. Lynch is a master of the surreal and it will depend on how much\nyou are willing to follow his abstractions of reality whether you can enjoy this or not. It is not a film I would\nlightly recommend to someone, but\nto those who want to see something\na bit different, I\u2019d push you to your\nseat and chain you to the chair until\nit\u2019s over, just in case you considered\nleaving half way through. The couple in front of me did, be warned\nthat it\u2019s not for everyone.\nBecoming Jane this isn\u2019t. I felt at\ntimes that someone was dragging\nwire scrubbers across my eye and\nRobert Andrews\nAmazing illusions aren\u2019t solely\nconfined to the likes of brilliant\nmagicians and conjurers. For ex-ample, have you ever wondered\nwhere all your alcohol disappears\nto every time you walk out of your\nroom, even with your faithful roommate guarding it? Perhaps you are\nstill puzzling over how that pile of\nwork suddenly appeared on your\ndesk. And how in the world did that\ndeadline creep up on you without\nyou seeing it coming?\nThe Illusionist manages to\nachieve the impossible, though, by\nkeeping you sitting there for two\nsolid hours despite comprised of\nmainly two-dimensional characters and a fairly dull beginning: it\nis the pleasingly convoluted and\nrapid advancement of the plot that\nmakes this film a fairly enjoyable\nexperience, continually keeping\nyou guessing.\nSet in turn-of-the-20th-Century\nAustria, it begins with the arrest\nof the mysterious and enigmatic\nEisenheim, charged with demonstrating necromancy on stage. At\nthis point we are introduced to the\ncharacters of the Chief Inspector of\nPolice and Crown Prince Leopold,\nthe latter of whom aggressively demands the former reveal the dark\nmagician\u2019s past to him; and so begins a far-fetched tale of childhood\nfriends, lost love, an unexplained\nThe Illusionist\nDirector: Neil Burger\nWriter: Neil Burger\nCast: Edward Norton,\nJessica Biel, Paul\nGiamatti\njourney and even an attempt to\noverthrow the government.\nYou get the whole package deal\nwith this story, and with a small\ncast compared to films of a similar\nnature, you would expect the film to\nbe primarily character driven. The\ncharacters, sadly, do not appear to\nhave much emotional depth, and\nsometimes it is difficult to feel for\nthe situations they so inconveniently put themselves in; however,\nas the plot is the driving force for\nthe entire production, by the time\nthe twists and turns start to slowly\nreveal themselves one cannot help\nbut root for the two lovers.\nJessica Biel, whilst not given a\nparticularly generous amount of\nscreen time, is perfectly adequate\nin the role of the great Eisenheim\u2019s\npassionate interest. Edward Norton is a good choice for the role of\nthe magician himself, and although\nhe cannot seem to force himself to\nportray emotion particularly ex-plicitly, in retrospect I believe this\nto be the essence of his role as the\nunassuming, straight-faced, highly\nintelligent master of the dark arts.\nUntil the very end his emotional\noutput is incredibly hard to see, and\nthe tone of his voice simply refuses\nto change, giving the audience the\ndistinct impression that he is always in control and never out of the\npicture.\nNevertheless, it is Paul Giamatti\u2019s performance as Chief Inspector\nUrl, right-hand man to the ruthless\nCrown Prince Leopold (played by\nan ominous, convincingly menacing Rufus Sewell) that steals the\nshow: torn apart by glory on one\nside and a moral duty on the oth-er, it is this inner conflict which\npropels the plot forwards. More\nsignificantly, it is the character to\nwhich the audience can relate to;\nhe is none the wiser as to how Eishenheim\u2019s spectacular feats are\naccomplished.\nThe pace of the plot is similar to\nthe plot itself, in that it begins slowly and does not pick up until about\na third of the way through, after\nthe characters are given some\nbackground history. Until this\npoint it is difficult to see what direction the film is taking although\nsuddenly, events take a turn for the\nworse and the storyline and pace\nexplode in the face of boredom\nand the more mundane character\nroles suddenly become far more\ninteresting.\nIt is safe to say that some people will predict the ending before\nit happens, but it is the journey\nyou take to get there which is far\nmore interesting. Whereas the\nfilm refuses to reveal many of the\ngreat magician\u2019s tricks, it does\nreveal how the greatest illusion\nwas accomplished, and this makes\nthe inevitable epilogue greatly\nsatisfying.\nAll in all, this is well worth the\nticket price simply to see Giamatti\u2019s show-stealing performance\nand to try and work out just how\nsuch an elaborate illusion seems\nso plausible; a truly mesmerising\nfilm.\nPure Magic.\nCould it be magic? It certainly casts some spell\nat others it seemed like cinema\nnirvana. He truly understands cinema in a way few directors do and\nmakes the audience undergo an experience rather than listen to a coherent story. This is his first feature\nI\u2019ve seen in the cinema and there is\nno other forum for it: my senses felt\nassaulted, totally overloaded in the\ndark atmosphere. As the lights go\nup I felt like talking to the random\npeople next to me about it, feeling\nthat we\u2019d shared an intense experience that doesn\u2019t come very often.\nThankfully I refrained.\nLaura Dern is fantastic in the\nlead role, carrying the whole film.\nBest known to many as Dr Ellie\nSatler in Jurassic Park, I wasn\u2019t\nexpecting that much from her\ngiven her absence from the industry for so long. But woah, does she\nimpress. This pulls the rug from\nunder Helen Mirren, no joke. She\nis required throughout to be so\nmany characters, conveying each\none brilliantly, and it\u2019s easy to understand why Lynch chose her for\ntheir third collaboration. Her face is\nnot typical Hollywood, and the fluorescent lipstick she sports at points\nadds character to a real human\nface, not some airbrushed goddess.\nI could gush for ages on this so I\u2019ll\nstop now.\nThe imagery is the key here.\nWhen it feels like it\u2019s dragging,\nsuddenly there\u2019s a room of girls doing the Locomotion. Or the people\nin rabbit heads spouting non-se-quiturs, one of whom is allegedly\nNaomi Watts. Not to mention the\nspectacular lighting throughout or\nthe way he uses camera focus to\nfurther distort space. It really is a\nsensual, both visual and audible,\nfeast right up until the last bar of\nNina Simone\u2019s \u201cSinnerman\u201d completes the credits.\nSo why wouldn\u2019t people like it\nthen? It\u2019s tough going if you\u2019re not\nlooking for cinema as art. If you\nwant a story then don\u2019t go to this\none without being warned. I found\nthat I had to psyche myself up in\nthe morning for it as it can take the\nmental concentration of a Jedi not\nto go mad yourself during a Lynch\nfilm. It\u2019s hard to remember lots of\nit too because of its innate abstract-ness, so you\u2019re left more with an\nimpression that specific scenes.\nAs for what Lynch is trying to convey with this, it could be interpreted\ndifferently by everyone who sees it.\nAs far as I can see, it seems to portray Hollywood as a land of confu-sion, uncertainty and menace. Is\nLynch trying to distance himself\nfrom Hollywood? He certainly isn\u2019t\na typical studio director but seems\nto have integrated himself into the\nmainstream, possibly as a token\nalternative.\nThat doesn\u2019t diminish his talents\nhowever, and Inland Empire sump-tuously wraps up everything it\nmeans to be a David Lynch film.\nInland Empire\nDirector: David Lynch\nWriter: David Lynch\nCast: Laura Dern, Jeremy\nIrons\nWhich one do you reckon is Naomi Watts then?\nStern Dern\nEd Norton gets the latest in magical accessories, a white magic 8 ball\nLittle Red Riding Hood walks into the wrong fairy tale\n19\nfelix\nFriday 16 March 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDavid Lynch returns with rabbits, screwdiver stabbing and the Locomotion.

    "content": "The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, has\nkept up his call for the widely controversial \u00a310,000-a-year student\nfees in a recent interview with The\nGuardian. He likened a science degree with learning to play the violin,\nwhich \u201ccan\u2019t be learnt in a week,\u201d\nand condemns an apparent general\nacceptance that a science degree\nis cheap; \u201cthe cost of an education\nat Imperial is not low and no one\nshould pretend it is.\u201d\nSeptember 2006 was the first intake of students paying \u00a33000 fees.\nThe critics\u2019 fear, that university applicants would fall as a result and\nthat the new system would price\npoorer students out of university,\nhas now been proved wrong. Applications were indeed down by 3.6%\nbut have now shot up for applications in 2007 by 7.1%. The system\nof paying back fees after university\nhas also been well received; less\nstudents now have to work over the\nsummer or get part-time jobs to\npay for their fees while at the same\ntime studying. The Conservative\nParty, who were opposed to \u00a33000\ntop-up fees, now admit they would\nnot abolish them; the university\nheads and the Government appear\nto have won the day.\nHowever, many university leaders\nand now the Government as well\nwish to raise the cap from \u00a33000\nup to \u00a310,000 in 2010. The support\nfor this is less than that for \u00a33000\nfees but still substantial, including\nour own Rector. The belief is that\nthe price of a degree for students\nshould reflect the cost of running\nthat degree and that a university\nsystem that works more like a market would be healthy. This would result in humanities degrees and science or engineering degrees with\nless of a practical element costing\nless than others. Biology at Imperial, for example, could cost a lot\nRector renews call\nfor \u00a310,000 fees\nmore than Biology at Oxford, which\nhas hardly any experimental work.\nThe price would not be set in\nstone though; universities could\ncharge what they like per year up to\n\u00a310,000. Rich universities could afford to charge less and so increase\ntheir intake, and poorer universities could not. The reason this has\nnot happened with \u00a33000-a-year\nfees is that most institutions charge\nthe full amount. With \u00a310,000, more\nvariation is likely. Different courses\nin the same universities could cost\ndifferent amounts. Admittedly this\ndoes not deter international students paying hugely expensive fees,\nbut they have made the choice; the\nstudents of the future will only be\nable to at the risk of sacrificing a\nbetter higher education.\nWhat this will all mean for the\nstudent? \u2013 that is, the student of the\nmost expensive university courses\n\u2013 science and engineering. These\nare students who are meant to be\nthe foundation of the future econo-my, and the highest earners, but not\neveryone wants to go into high-paid\nscience jobs.\nDo we need more consultants and\nfewer doctors? More investment\nbankers and less researchers?\nA student leaving after a 3-year\ncourse could have up to \u00a344,000 in\ndebt, which, if they earnt \u00a330,000 a\nyear after leaving university (way\nabove most students\u2019 first wage)\nwould still take them 7.5 years to\nrepay it. A medic could leave with a\ndebt of over \u00a387,000.\nNot everyone, of course, wants to\nbecome a scientist when they decide to do a science degree. These\nhigher fees have the danger of\nmaking the elite more elitist, and\ndistancing complex science and\nengineering more from the general\npublic in a country where science\nA-levels and those entering teaching has already fallen, a problem\nthat Sir Richard is very aware of.\nA science degree is also needed for\nteaching \u2013 not exactly\nthe most highly-paid job.\nThe universities need\nthe money, and the Government says it will not donate more than \u00a33bn a year\ntowards funding higher education as not everyone enjoys this\nbenefit. However, if we want this sci-ence- and engineer-based economy\nto one day be fully realised, should\nstudents be the ones to pay for it?\nAnd is a market university culture\nthe best way to proceed \u2013 to add to\nthe stress of A-levels and academic excellence the further anxiety\nabout money. \u201cYoung people in the\nUK today,\u201d says Sir Richard, \u201cparticularly from the state schools, are\nnot able to get the qualifications to come to a place\nlike this.\u201d That may\nchange.

The now\nex-Homeland Security adviser for\nthe Conservatives, Patrick Mercer,\nhas been fired by David Cameron,\nby allegedly implying on the Times\nOnline website that racism in the\narmy is acceptable. Now Professor\nDavidColemanofOxfordUniversity\nhas been accused of racism by students for his views on immigration.\nStudents at the university, as part\nof \u2018Student Action for Refugees\u2019\nhave started a petition calling for\nProfessor Coleman\u2019s resignation\ndespite admitting that this would\nProfessor dragged into immigration racism row\nnever happen. Professor Coleman\nis a member and co-founder of the\nthink tank Migration Watch UK,\nwhich, as a body with no Government funding, gives advice about\nimmigration, which it believes is\ncurrently too prevalent. Their website explains how, although they do\nnot see immigration as intrinsically\nbad, they seek for an annual cap on\nthe numbers of immigrants entering the country. Professor Coleman\nhas been known to downplay the\nbenefit of immigrants to the econo-my, saying that they donate \u201cabout\na Mars bar a month\u201d. The website\ngoes on to say: \u201cThe impact on GDP\nper head is a small fraction of 1%.\nIn Britain, congestion costs probably wipe that out.\u201d What exactly\nthis means in terms of past, future,\nsample size and who exactly they\ninclude as \u2018immigrants\u2019 remains\nunclear.\nWhether or not you agree with\nProfessor Coleman\u2019s views, voices\nin support of freedom of speech,\nespecially at a university, have\npointed out that they are certainly\nnot racist. Evan Harris, the MP\nfor Oxford West has said that\nthe professor\u2019s remarks were\n\u201clegal\u201d and so he should have\nno fear of retribution from his\nemployer.\nDavid Coleman has\nbeen called \u2018racist\u2019\nbut his views are for a\nreformofimmigration\npolicy. Even if they\nare entirely anti-immigrant, they\nare not racist. His\npoints are economical and social, not racial.\nWhen compared to the two\nother academics of recent times\nwho have been accused of racism,\nthe fuss about Professor Coleman\nis hard to understand.

So\nwe build up an argument and in some cases this may\ngo to the small claims court.\nOver the past couple of years the government\nhave been looking at private housing and the next\ndevelopment in this is the Tenancy Deposit scheme,\nbasically what this means is that any one moving\ninto a private house or \ufb02at and signs an assured\nshorthold tenancy, has their security deposit put into\nan approved government scheme by the landlord.\nIf a landlord chooses not to do this and is reported\nthen it is possible that the tenant could be awarded 3\ntimes the amount of deposit they have paid, so what\ndoes all this mean for the average private student\ntenant? Well hopefully this article will answer some\nof your questions.\nLandlords will be able to choose from two types of\nscheme,oneisasinglecustodialschemethisiswhere\nthe landlord would pay the deposit into the scheme\nhanding the full amount over to the scheme.\nAt the end of the tenancy and if both parties agree\nto the amount of money being paid back, then the\nscheme will pay back the agreed amount to the\ntenant, if there is a disagreement the a dispute\nresolution service will step in at no extra cost to solve\nthe disagreement.\nThe second type of scheme is an insurance based\nscheme, where the tenant would pay a security\ndeposit to the landlord but in this instance the\nlandlord retains the deposit and pays a premium to\nthe scheme.\nIf there is a dispute the landlord will legally have to\nhand over the full deposit to the scheme until the\nsituation is resolved, if the landlord doesn\u02bct comply\nand a decision is made in favour of the tenant, then\nthe insurance payments cover this.\nThese schemes are all run by private companies\nbut the key di\ufb00erence from the way deposits were\nheld before is that there is an independent dispute\nresolution service in the past, it could take weeks of\narguing with a landlord then eventually it may get to\nthe small claims court, this could often be costly and\nintimidating for a student to initiate, this way there is\nno need to take it to the small claims court.\nOf course it is likely that there will be a few teething\nproblems with the scheme in the \ufb01rst few months\nso the Information And Advice Centre has drawn up\nsome important points to remember when signing\nan assured shorthold tenancy after 6th April 2007:\n1. Insist on your landlord drawing up an inventory,\nthis is a piece of paper which will have the condition\nof everything in the property on the date you move\nin, this will make it easier to decide the condition of\nfurniture and the like when you move out.\n2. When you move into the property take pictures of\nanything that you think may cause a problem when\nyou move out of the property, try and ensure you\ncan get these dated somehow, so for example if the\nlandlord says there is a stain on your carpet take a\npicture of this to avoid getting charged when you\nmove out.\n3. Ensure that your landlord is part of the scheme\nand don\u02bct take any excuses or explanations as to\nwhy they are not, if you have questions or are not\nsure whether your landlord should be part of the\nscheme please contact the Information and Advice\nCentre.\n4. In the scheme when the landlord and tenant are\nagreed on the amount to be paid to the tenant, this\nmust be paid back within 10 days, this is the same if\nthere is a dispute and a decision has been made .If\na landlord fails to comply with this rule then further\naction can be taken.\n5. Any assured shorthold tenancy that is signed\nbefore April 6th 2007, the tenancy deposit scheme\nwill not apply it is only those assured shorthold\ntenancies that are signed after this date that will be\npart of the scheme.\nThis scheme is a\nmassive change\nto the way that\nlandlords used\nto conduct their\nbusiness in the\npast. The scheme\nmay be able to\nhave a massive\nimpact on students\nas tenants, however\nthis will mean\nnothing if students\nare not aware of the\nscheme so I would\nask anyone reading\nthis to pass the\nword on or show\npeople this article.\nAs an advice centre we will be distributing some\npromotional materials on campus over the next\ncouple of weeks, NUS will also be helping us by\nproviding promotional materials, so help the student\ncommunity by spreading the word!\nObviously there is a wealth of information on this\nsubject and in this article I have tried to give you a\nbrief introduction to the tenancy deposit scheme, if\nyou have any further questions regarding this article\nplease do not hesitate to contact The Information\nand Advice Centre\nMoving into private housing after April 6th? Read this!\nNigel Cooke\nStudent Adviser\nadvice@imperial.ac.uk\n020 7594 8067\nimperialcollegeunion.org/advice\nThis week the Union Council passed a radical\nenvironmental policy that calls for the Union to\nreduce the waste it sends to land\ufb01ll by 50% by 2010\nand to reduce its carbon emissions by 60% by 2009.\nThis policy came about following an overwhelmingly\npositive response to an environmental petition that\nwas signed by over 1300 students during Green\nWeek.Giventhatwehaveneverhadanenvironmental\npolicy before, I think this is a bold and positive step\nforward. In the long run we aspire to achieve carbon\nneutral status by 2012 \u2013 but \ufb01rst we need to focus\non the basics.\nWe aim to achieve these ambitious targets by\nimplementing the following operational policies:\n1. Reduce our waste by using reusable crockery and\ncutlery instead of disposable crockery and cutlery in\nour catering outlets;\n2. Reuse our waste by using reusable glasses and\nmulti-use ski\ufb00s;\n3. Recycle and compost as much waste as possible\nand ensure that recycled waste is sorted into the\ncorrect bins;\n4. Procure products that have a high recycled content\nwhere practicable;\n5. Reduce our water consumption through installing\nsimple devices in existing appliances that use water;\n6. Reduce energy use by maximising building energy\nperformance in the Beit Building Masterplan;\n7. Reduce energy wastage by improved building\nmanagement(i.e.byturningo\ufb00lightsandcomputers\nin the evening, turning down radiators in unused\nrooms, and so on).\n8. Substitute carbon-emitting energy for renewable\nenergy by lobbying the College to use energy\nsupplies from a low-carbon source.\n9. Support and where feasible, pursue proposals for\nthe installation of onsite renewable energy and zero-carbon technology\non College\nBuildings.\n10. Reduce\nthe Union\u02bcs\ndependency on\nair travel to certain\ndestinations (as\ndetailed in the\nnew Union\u02bcs Tours\nPolicy) by not\nsubsidizing short-haul \ufb02ights.\nObviously we will\nnot be able to implement these policies all at once\nso please give us a few months grace to bring in\nthese changes over time. However, the Union can\nonly do so much and every member of the College\ncommunity has a role to play in helping reduce our\ncarbon footprint, waste and water consumption.\nLast week representatives from the Union and the\nEnvironmental society met with the head of facilities\nmanagement, Nick Roalfe, to discuss the College\u02bcs\nenergy and waste strategy. What emerged from this\ndiscussion is that plans and policies and in place or\nare being developed, but many are simply not being\nenforced. So, if you know of a building that turns\nthe heat on full on a hot, sunny day then please tell\nus (the Union) or the College and we can advise the\nappropriate manager to take action. By taking simple\nmeasures like this, I am optimistic that we can make\nan impact that I hope will inspire others to do the\nsame.\nThis leaves me to wish to a relaxing, green Easter\nholiday and best of luck with your revision!\nPresident\u2019s Update\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nAny student at Imperial who has spent the summer\ntermrevisingintheCentralLibrarywillbeabletorelate\nagrimtaleofovercrowdeddesks,unhygienicstudents\nand, most importantly, soaring temperatures. The\nlibrary is a mix of 1960s concrete and 1990s glass\n\u2013 creating a building which has the same e\ufb00ect as a\ngreen house with no ventilation. While this may be\nbearableinthewintermonths,assummerapproaches\nand temperatures rise and working conditions\nplummet.\nThis situation is long standing, and not particularly\neasy to solve. The library already has specialist glass\nand window blinds \ufb01tted,designed to reduce solar\ngain, but this simply isn\u02bct enough. Luckily for students\naction is being taken to change this \u2013 the library is\nundergoing a facelift. You won\u02bct have been able to\navoid the work carried out in the library last term. This\ninvolved relocating the humanities department, but\nmore importantly improving the ventilation provided\nto \ufb02oors 4 and 5. This was the \ufb01rst phase of a series\nof works to dramatically improve the library, with\nthe second phase (due to start this summer) even\nmore ambitious \u2013 a complete re\ufb01t of the ground\n\ufb02oor to provide modern, \ufb02exible study space and\nthe installation of solar shading on \ufb02oors 4 and 5 to\nfurther reduce the soaring temperatures. More details\nare available at www.imperial.ac.uk/library.\nUnfortunatelythereisbadnews.Localresidentsobjected\nto the original proposal, or more speci\ufb01cally the solar\nshading. Apparently the shading was \u02bbtoo dense\u02bc and\nit marred the building by obstructing the windows on\nthe 4th and 5th \ufb02oor (of course the residents objected\nwhenthisextensionwasbuilt).Youmaythinkthatthis\nisn\u02bct enough to stop a planning application, but you\nwould be wrong. As a result of this the College was\nforced re-submit the planning application without\nthe solar shading. Although a separate application\nfor revised solar\nshading will go in,\nthis is a real shame\nfor students as it\nmeans another\nsummerofblistering\ntemperatures.\nThis should have\nbeen the end to\nthis sorry saga. But\nno, residents are\nobjecting to the\nrevised application\non grounds\nwhich can best be\ndescribed as petty. Issues like the precise appearance\nof a plant room which can be viewed by a handful of\npeopleattherearofAlexandraCourt.Isthisreallythat\nimportant?Thereisarealdangerthattheseobjections\ncould put o\ufb00 the library redevelopment completely,\nleaving students in an untenable situation. We need to\nmake sure this doesn\u02bct happen.\nWhat can I do?\nRight now the best thing you can do is to support\nthe College\u02bcs planning application (ref no. 06/0743/\nFULL). You can do this online at www.westminster.\ngov.uk/environment/planning/, or by sending a letter\nto the planning department.

Akhmed\nKadyrov was a leading separatist,\nfighting for Chechen independence,\nuntil 1999, when he defected and became staunchly pro-Russian.\nIn 2003, Akhmed was elected as\npresident with Kremlin support,\nand was notorious for his alleged\nmethods of suppressing rebellious\ntensions in the troubled region,\nincluding kidnapping, torture, and\nmurder.\n\u201cIllegal interrogation methods\nand torture are routine in Chechnya\u201d said Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner Thomas\nHammarberg last Thursday with\nrespect to the nomination.\nRamzan Kadyrov, who turned\nthe legal presidential age of 30 last\nmonth, is seen as a strong leader,\nand has widespread support in\nGrozny, and most importantly, in\nMoscow.

Just a few names that I\nneed to remind you of, not because\nyou don\u2019t know them anyway, but\nbecause we may forget.

This\ngenocide was mostly carried out by\ntwo extremist Hutu militia groups,\nthe Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi, during a period of about\n100 days from April 6 through mid-July 1994. Over 500,000 Tutsis and\nthousands of moderate Hutus died\nin the genocide with some reports\nestimating the number of victims to\nbe between 800,000 and 1,000,000.\nIn the wake of the Rwandan Genocide, the United Nations and the\ninternational community in general\ndrew severe criticism for its inac-tion. Despite international news\nmedia coverage of the violence as it\nunfolded, most countries, including\nFrance, Belgium, and the United\nStates, declined to intervene or\nspeak out against the massacres.\nCanada continued to lead the UN\npeacekeeping force in Rwanda,\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission\nfor Rwanda (UNAMIR). However,\nthe UN did not authorize UNAMIR\nto intervene or use force to prevent\nor halt the killing.\npolitical moderates irrespective of\ntheir ethnic backgrounds. Large\nnumbers of opposition politicians\nwere also murdered.\nMany nations evacuated their nationals from Kigali and closed their\nembassies as violence escalated.\nNational radio urged people to stay\nin their homes, and the govern-ment-funded station RTLM broadcast vitriolic attacks against Tutsis\nand Hutu moderates. Hundreds of\nroadblocks were set up by the militia in the capital\nAfter losing the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, the US refused to\nprovide requested material aid to\nRwanda. France, China, and Russia opposed involvement in what\nwas seen as an \u201cinternal affair\u201d.\nDallaire was directly \u201ctaken to\ntask,\u201d in his words, for even suggesting that UNAMIR should raid\nHutu militants\u2019 weapons caches,\nwhose location had been disclosed\nto him by a government informant.\nThe UN \u201cfailed\u201d to respond adequately to Dallaire\u2019s urgent re-quests.
