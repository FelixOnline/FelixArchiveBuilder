    "content": "Anthem For Bored Youth\n\"Here We Are Now: Entertain Us\"\nSet your MTV mindset on to fast forward as we flick through the delights in store during\nFreshers' Weekfor students new, old and indifferent (you lucky people).\nOne day I 'll learn not to push my luck. Sure, making snide comments about the evolutionary\npedigree of the mobile mountain we were stranded behind, vainly trying to catch a glimpse of the\nstage, wasn't strictly the smartest thing I 've ever done. But 'accidentally' spilling my pint over his\ngirl-friend for an encore...well, that was just plain dumb. Neck muscles the size of Henry Rollins'\nslowly tensed as he turned with all the menacing speed of continental drift. My new-found friends\nevaporated like the morning dew, and suddenly I felt, very, very alone...\n...which is what the fun and games of Fresher's week is all about: trying not to feel alone in\na new place and situation. The standard advice is to go to everything, if only so you don't have\ntime to worry about spending the next few years of your life with a bunch of complete strangers\n(gulp). Don't panic, the sea of unfamiliar faces will quickly resolve into the comforting features of\nfriends from hall, friends from your course and 'friends' you met at registration (and have been\ntrying to avoid ever since). So make the most of those few precious days when the grind of coursework and exams is still a distant gleam in your lecturers' eye. Get out there and party! (Just don't annoy any neanderthals during the Freshers' Ball, OK? It, isn't worth the bruises...)\nFreshers' Week kicks off on Monday in traditional style with the New Year's Carnival. There's an Irish Ceilidh, complete with real ale bar, late bar until 2am and disco 'til 3 and a chance to look\nstupid on the Bucking Bronco and Surf Simulator rides. Music comes from Indie hopefuls 'Salad'.\nTheir lead singer used to be avid co jockey for MTV, which just about says it, all...\nWednesday Night is Party Night, starring Geno Washington's Hypnotic Show: a Hypnotism\nshow with a difference (it says here). Geno is also allegedly a 'soul legend' (can't say I 've ever\nheard of him) so perhaps lie sends you to sleep with his singing... Apart from the usual late, bar\nand disco there's the cult experience of the Double Six Club... a night of wacky fun where waiters\nencourage you to relive your childhood with all your favourite games like Ker-Plunk, Hungry\nHippos and Risk (personally, my favourite game as a kid was 'doctors and nurses' - Ed). Sounds,\nerm, interesting.\nThe Grand Finale to the Week is Friday's Freshers' Ball, featuring\nthe by-now obligatory late bar and disco which tonight goes under the\nsomewhat unfortunate name of the 'Funky Bunker'. The best in funk,\ndance and rare groove aided and abetted by some top-name DJ's. You\ncan also try your luck at the Guilds Casino (well, I guess betting is one\nway to supplement your meagre grant). Finally, there's the musical\ntalents of dance outfit SubSub, famous for the hit 'Ain't No Love (Ain't, No Use)' and...very little else, actually. Support, comes from tribute\nband 'Peroxide Blondie'. No prizes for guessing which band they're a 'tribute' to. What next, a 'Status Quo' tribute band?\nAll the big events going on during Freshers' Week take place in the\nUnion Building in Beit Quad. Be there - or be somewhere else.\n(Hey, we're not going to force you to have a good time).\nTO ATTEND UNION EVENTS YOU NEED COLLEGE ID\n(EITHER UNION CARD OR REGISTRATION FORM)\nFreshers' Week\nChecklist\n| Do the registration two-step in the\nJCR on Monday or Tuesday. This\ninvolves getting to the front of one\nqueue, only to discover you need to\nfill out a dozen forms in triplicate\nand join the end of another queue.\nPatience is a virtue...\n| Collect Grant Cheque from JCR on\nMonday/Tuesday, then apply for a student loan on Wednesday when\nyour grant runs out.\n| Fresher's Reception, Monday, the\nGreat Hall. Good way to catch up on\nlost sleep.\n| Get College ID/Union card from\nyour department. Extra points for the\nmost obviously hung-over photo.\nI Register with the Medical Centre .\n| Go to Freshers' Fair on Tuesday (see\nguide in this issue for more details).\nIPA A ART EEEE! Freshers' Week ticket (all three days) costs \u00a315. Otherwise tickets to the\nNew Year Carnival and Freshers' Ball are \u00a36 and \u00a37 apiece, while\nWednesday's Party Night atmosphere is yours to sample for a fiver. You\ncan also buy tickets from the Union office. A new dressing for your Salad days at Imperial.\n030CT91 FELIX "

    "content": "Feature\nPuccini Packs in the Punters\nPatrick Wood was swapped at birth with an opera columnist and became th\ncritic to send his own quotes to Pseuds' Comer. Below, two evenings ofthe wo\nmost exciting and extravagant art form make him forget about sex.\nWith minority cultural events such as Polish\nsurrealist, cinema, it's a fair bet that sooner or\nlater someone's going to take their clothes off.\nThe reverse of this symbiotic relationship\nbetween the intellectual and the corporeal is\nthat when, for example, I went, to see\nBorowczyk's The Beast at. the Everyman (he,\nother week I could claim, to anyone 1 saw who\nknew me, to be there for the biting Bunuelian\nanti-clerical satire.\nThere's not much nudity in opera (unless\nMaria Ewing's doing Salome) and the downside of designer-led, big budget productions is\nthat there sometimes isn't much thought either.\nNot, an accusation that can be levelled at\nEnglish National Opera's latest, Tosco.: the\nnew management is weighed down by a huge\nbox office deficit, but director Keith Warner has\nsucceeded in substituting ideas for cash. The\nsets are sparse but inventive and beautifully lit.\nAct HI on the castle battlements has a lime-green dawn sky behind an Expressionist jumble\nof sentry-boxes and a sinister crimson stairwell.\nThe end of Act I looks good too; priests and\ncardinals process downstage and we see, as the\nobsessed Baron Scarpia sings his 'Tosca, you\nmake me forget about God', that their statue is\nnot, the Virgin Mary but Tosca herself.\nThe main roles are strongly sung. Henk\nSmit brings creepy villainy to the part, of\nScarpia, Chief of Secret Police and arch-operatic\nnasty. Rosalind Plowright, is power fill and steely\nas Tosca, although occasionally a little shrill. On\nthe first night, the orchestra 'under Sir Alexander\nGibson didn't: seem totally happy with some of\nthe dramatic gear-shifts, particularly in Act I, but\nthis is surely no longer a problem.\nSeptember is becoming unofficial Puccini\nfestival month in Loudon, as the two opera\nhouses alternate his crowd-pullers to kickstart\ntheir seasons. It's not hard to see why.\nTurandot, like Tosca, has a strong plot (no\nbabies swapped at birth here), racy characters\nand a hit-list of stunning tunes. Andrei Serban's opulent production, revived by the Royal\nOpera, dales from 19J54 and was obviously\ncreated in a different financial climate to the\none in which ENO are currently having to\nwork. The stage is filled with colour and move-ment: a giant grindstone is wheeled on by\ndancing ninjas; severed heads trail crepe blood,\nand the ancient Emperor Alloum descends from\nthe ceiling on an enormous cushion. The tenor\nGiuseppe Giacomini is terrific as Calaf. The\nfamous Act III aria in which he vows not to let\nthe tyrannical Princess Turandot walk all over\nhim (Nessun dorma i) is superbly delivered. As\nTurandot,, Sharon\nSweet looks like nothing so much as a vast\nsinging pillow. Her\nvoice may not. be the\nmost, beautiful of\ninstruments, but. it has\nthrilling power and\nwhat's more she can\nact. (Note that the cast\nchanges after October\n3rd.) Of the orchestral\nseries starting up\naround now (including\nDeutsche Romantik on\nthe South Bank and a Berlioz series from the\nBBC SO) it's the\nLondon Symphony\nOrchestra's Mahler\ncycle that looks set to\nbe the autumn's hottest ticket, deservedly so on the evidence of the first, two\nconcerts. Michael\nTilson Thomas is currently the most exciting conductor in\nLondon. He's prepared to take risks \u2014\nincluding that: of not\nre timing during the\nlong span of the\nSecond Symphony,\nleading to a couple of\nbad mis-pitching s in the finale. A small price to\npay for a reading of great, excitement and sus-pens e, not a little of which centred on whether\nMr\nIT was going to manage to stay on the podi-um. One moment he is crouched almost on his\nhaunches behind his music-stand; the next, he\nuncoils like a spring and lunges forward as if to\nkebab the violas on his baton. The orchestra\nresponds with sizzling virtuosity, nowhere, more\nso than in the eruptions of the Second\nSymphony's awesome funeral march. Next will\nbe the monstrous Third Symphony, in a concert which also includes Brahms and Benjamin\n\u2014 a long haul both for audience and players.\nEach concert, is being played twice, so the\nprospects for student standby look good.\n\u2022 Tosca is al the Coliseum, St Martin's Lane,\nuntil Oct 27th. Box office (071) 632 8300.\nSeats from \u00a38 in advance, \u00a35 on the day.\nRosalindPlowright as Tosca (Photo: Clive Barda)\nStudent standby: stalls seats for \u00a315 from three\nhours before the performance (subject to a vai ability).\n\u2022 Turandot is al the.

Da Vinci's snack bar,\nthe Unions' Beit Quad refectory,\nwas drenched around 9.00am on\nThursday, October 29th, by water\nexploding from two open pipes on\nthe floor above.\nThe pipes were a defunct part,\nof the buildings recently\nmodernised heating system.\nExpecting all old pipes to have\nbeen capped (sealed) the heating\nengineers were, said to have,\nconfidently turned on the water: a move, which resulted in two three\nfoot, high fountains issuing from\nthe cap less pipes. It is not known\nat this time why these open holes\nwere not. revealed when the\nsystem was tested.\nThe fault, occurred in Union\nadvisor Minevar Kavlak's office\nand was discovered by a cleaner\nwho heard the sound of gushing\nwater. He alerted Ian Parish,\nDeputy President for Clubs and\nSocieties. College workmen were\nalso called. Mr Parish held fort\nwith a workman, stemming the\nflow with his thumb. He was soon\naided by Dan Look, DP Finance\nand Services, who later\ncommented: \"I felt, like a Dutch\nboy with my finger in a dyke...\"\nEventually both DP's were\nHappy hour again?\nrelieved and the pipes were\ncapped.\nMeanwhile Union staff\nworried anxiously at. the prospect\nof facing fresher s' week without\nthe bar. There were reports of\ntears: certainly anxious faces were\nworn by many. It was thought, at\nfirst that power might, be lost, for a week, an obviously calamitous\neventuality, but later these fears\nwere shown to be premature and\nit is now anticipated, as FELIX\ngoes to press, that the engineers\ncan have the room ready by\nSaturday. Miss Kavlak's room\nescaped with only light: damage\nand it is hoped that all costs will\nbe met through insurance.\nDan Look and. fan Parish decline to pull their thumbs out..\nThere are three things that\ncame from Budleigh Sallerlon this\nyear, and the poor lit lle backwater\nseaside resort on the south\nDevonshire coast didn't know\nwhat had hit it.\nThe first was the triumphant\nreturn of Opsoc's summer tour\nhaving played The Pirates of\nPenzance and Daughters of\nMisfortune to 10 packed\nhouses during their two\nweek stay. The second\nis a secret, but will be\nrevealed in ad trilling tale of der ring do and\nother nonsense,\naccompanied by the strains of\n1960's rock 'n' roll, 1970's glam\nrock and a liberal dosage of the\nmusical delights of The Rocky\nHorror Show, Return To The\nForbidden Planet and Little Shop\nOf Horrors in: It Came From\nBudleigh Salterton. It will be,\nperformed on Monday 7th November following a weekend\nworkshop on the 5th and 6th.

In Cabaret we have just\nwhat, we are looking for. The plot,\ncentres around two relationships:\nthose between a Jewish couple and\na cabaret singer and how she\nmeets and falls for an American\nIt Came From\nBudleigh Salterton\nvisiting Berlin in the 1930's. The humour is blacker than night,\nand the Klub's eerie Master of\nCeremonies leads you on a sinister\njourney through life in pre-war\nBerlin. There arc many large and\nsmall roles to be filled for this\nproduction and the chorus have\nplenty to do. The script is\nwonderfully written and is\nsupported by the brilliant songs\nthat Kander and Ebb are famous\nfor.

    "content": "News Feature\nWhose Line is it Anyway?\nDavid Cohen dials the international connection on the new college phone syst\nThe ten year old phone system installed in\nImperial was showing signs of age. With the\ndemand for more extensions constantly\nincreasing, the only way of satisfying this\nseemingly insatiable hunger was by running\nsmall exchanges piggy-backed on two to three\nmain lines, which act as splitting points so that\nmore phone lines could be connected. This, for\nexample, is what happened in Prince's Gardens: 4 lines ran from the Linstead\nexchange to College, so that only 4 calls could\nbe directed outside of Prince's Gardens at any\none time. These four lines served all the\nresidents in Prince's Gardens, some 1000\nstudents in total!\nThe new phone system project was\nconceived in December 1990. After filtering\nthrough layers of college administration and\ndecision making, the project was finally\nadopted and the birth date of the new system\nwas set: 25th June 1994.\nOn this particular weekend an innocent,\nunsuspecting, student (lets call him Mr. Phi)\ndecides to call Silwood Park (Imperial College's outer arm) for some friendly discourse. Mr Ph1\ndials the appropriate numbers: 72 (Evelyn\nGardens to South Kensington) 4- 96 (South\nKensington to Silwood) + the rest of tic\nextension. n rrr i Whenyou put a new\nB ii t hark! What\nBT error\nmessage through yonder headset breaks? It is\n\"Your number has not been recognised\" and\nhey presto, we have free phone calls! Only a student (See Pages 18-19 for a detailed\nanalysis of the genre) would not pass up on\ntelephone system in\neverybody is going to try\nand break it.\"\nsuch an opportunity. Needless to say, such\nnews spreads amongst the impoverished, Tory\nstricken, student society like wild fire.\nThe fault was reported to the College\nTelecommunications division and promptly\nrectified. But, rumour has it, many\ninternational phone calls were made in the\nshort time that the fault existed \u2014New\nZealand and Singapore being amongst the\ndestinations mentioned. When queried about\nthis Alan Hillycr, Telecommunications\nManager, said that he was unaware of any\nproblems existing in the system; but\nacknowledged that such faults were a possibility. \"At the moment, there is lots of extra\nprogramming going.on with this [national]\n\"Phone-day\". With all the national codes\nchanging, Ericsson Ltd. [College phone\ncontractors] have been doing a lot of extra\nprogramming, and it is quite possible that they\ncould have changed something, without me\nknowing, that would have upset the dialling\npatterns.\"\nOther sources have revealed that there\nwas apparently a similar problem inside the\nCollege network, on, and following, the BT\n\"Phone-day\". This saw the replacement of the\n010 international dialling code with the\nsimplified 00, finally bringing\nBritain in line with the long\nstanding international standard.\nA member of staff in the\nComputing Centre, told\nFELIX that he discovered this\nproblem on the 15th of August,\nand dutifully reported it on that\nday. Furthermore he claims to\nhave had knowledge of people who made\ninternational calls, on phones which were not\nsupposed to permit this service, seven weeks\nafter he reported the fault.\nSo how common is the awareness of the\nfault? Mr. Hillyer knew of a person in the\nChemical Engineering department who had\nnotified him of this problem. Sources in College\nhave also informed FELIX that a similar fault\nwas being exploited in the Chemistry\ndepartment. \"I mean everybody is going to be\ntrying it. When you put a new telephone\nsystem in everybody is going to try and break\nit. The old system, after 10 years, had had\nvirtually all its holes plugged up, although if an\noccasional reconfiguration was made a door\nmight still be accidently left open,\" says Mr\nHillyer. \"Of course in such situations College\nwill have to foot the bill\" . It's a bill which\nseems to be growing ever larger.\nThis \"back-door\" syndrome seems to be\na common ailment in large scale technological\nsystems (Another example of which is the\nexpanding global computer network, which\nseems to be taking on a life of its own). Of\ncourse when such a back-door is discovered it\nis more likely than not to be exploited before it\nis reported. Mr Hillyer reassured that \"Procedures\nare in place for finding out things like that and\nwho is responsible\", but refused to elaborate on\nthem.\nThe new telephone exchange system is\ncompletely computer controlled. All the system\nparameters are changeable in software which is\nmaintained by Ericssons \u2014 an authorised\ncontractor and manufacturer. Problems seem\nto occasionally arise due to some side effects of\nthe modifications made by Ericssons which\neffect the present, customised, configuration at\nIC. Because of the mode of operation, there is\nno single person in the position to be able to\nknow everything about the entire system.\nConsequently its difficult to make sure that\nconsistency is maintained in the system from\nmodification to modification. Currently,\nthough, it seems that all known loopholes have\nbeen detected and blocked. But, there is no\nguarantee that every possible dodge has been\neffectively barred. Some mention of \"patches\"\nin the system (quick fixes), which are used by\nengineers to quickly remedy local problems,\nCast aspersions on the long term integrity of the\nsystem. The jinx has even reached as far as\nBeit Quad. Earlier on during the exchange\nreorganisation, FELIX experienced some\ntelephonic problems too. Yes, even the\nimpenetrable walls of FELIX TOWERS where audaciously attacked.\n\"It's all gone very smoothly\", remarked\nMr. Hillyer commenting on the new system\ninstallation, after considering all the problems\nencountered. But if anyone knows a cheap way\nof calling aunts in Australia , please contact the\nFELIX office.\nliM FELIX030 C T9H "

For example, an article in\nFELIX984 featured what was\nonly the second ever appearance\nin these pages of the word\n'peroration'. It was first used some\nyears ago by Professor Sir Hugo\nDregg-Strayner, holder of the\nTetley's Chair of Convection and\nDiffusion, in an article entitled\n'2000 Perorations'.

Unfortunately our cameraman\nwas stampeded when a herd of them overheard a cry of 'Free beer at\nSouthside' which a drunken fresher unwittingly blurted. Work is unknown\nto these types, whose favourite, form of exercise is to lift a glass to their\nmouth, or tip it over someone's head. If questioned, they will often deny\ntheir laziness by claiming to be in a spoils team, usually because 'they have\ngreat, post-match parties'. Often on the look out for group 3, some gain a pathological condition known as 'shark use xt rem is'. They can easily be\nspotted by their large dorsal fin and an air of desperation.\nMM FELIX030 CT91 "

    "content": "Opinion\nWelcome, welcome, welcome\nGood day to everyone reading\nFELIX for the first time and hello\nagain to the rest of you. I hope,\nyou enjoy the contents of this issue\n(and those ahead) and that the\nnew layout comes across as an\npositive, improvement rather than\njust, a new change of stripes! This\nissue is designed as a one-off\n'Freshers Issue' biased towards\nfeatures: news and reviews will\nreturn soon! The exact format of\nthe newspaper is still somewhat in\na state of flux and so you may find\nthings changing over the weeks\nahead. This is perfectly normal \u2014\ndo not adjust your set. If anyone\nhas any comments or suggestions,\nfavourable or otherwise, I'd be\nhappy to hear them at the usual\naddress.\nThe, boys of summer...\nAh, those lazy Indian summer\ndays. After a relaxed couple of\nmonths everyone has suddenly\narrived to photocopy, advertise,\nphotocopy, contribute, photocopy;\nprint, photocopy and share my\njam do iu its. On lop of this we are\nattempting to move house (or\nrather my flat mates are\nattempting to move my stuff - I have editorials to write!) One, of\nthem just, arrived to say we can\nnow add a \u00a330 parking ticket onto\nthe cost of transporting our\nworldly possessions. Arrgh! The\ncost, was high enough already -this is our second move in a week.\nThe first failed because shortly\nafter signing contracts the\nlandlord informed us that, we\ncould not move in due to a slight\ntechnical hitch: he didn't actually\nown the Hat. Instead, we had to\nwait in another flat for a week\n(tenants or squatting I'm neither\nsure, nor care any more). This was\noriginally clue to a delay in the\nformality of paper signing clue to\n'Jewish holidays'. Later it became\nobvious that if this was true, then\nJewish people must be amongst\nthe most vacation ally able d peoples of the world. Soon it was\nofficial: there would be no flat.\nFrantically we looked for another\nplace, and by spending over \u00a3200\n(!) on an agent we, have finally\ngot one. The only snag is we\ncouldn't, move in until this\nafternoon and the people due. to\nmove into our new flat, (that\nwasn't ours) and is now our old\nflat would be arriving sometime at\nmidday. But I live in FELIX now\nit seems, so what do I care...\nCommunication\nSomething I am quite pleased\nabout, within this issue are the\narticles on the walkway and the\nphone system.\nThis is partially because\nthey required communication\nbetween the student, media, the\nunion and 'college' to produce,\njournalism which informs you of\nwhat is happening around your\ncollege and why. 1 hope that, we\ncan build up the relationship with\nthese disparate groups in the\ncoming months and that anyone,\nregardless of position, can feel that\nthey can talk to us in a professional manner concerning\nany matter they believe to be\nimportant.\nThe Constitution\nThe proposed new Imperial\nCollege Union constitution,\n(which, for new kids, provides the\n'rules' for how the Union should\noperate - in fact it defines the\nUnion) should be available for\ninspection this week. Copies of the\nmain document body are already\navailable from the Union office,\nbut the appendices have been\ndelayed until Friday. I would\nsuggest, that anyone with even a passing interest in the Union\nconsults these proposals and\nconsiders how it may affect them:\nfrom Union structure and student\nrepresentation to the operation of\ntheir favourite clubs and societies.\nAnyone, with queries, problems or\nsuggestions concerning the\nconstitution should visit, the\nSabbaticals in the Union office to\ntalk about them. The constitution\nis set. to go before the first UGM of\nterm, October 14th, so act last if\nyou want to have your say. Full\ndetails in next weeks FELIX.\nSome thank you's Finally I'd just like to thank a few\npeople for getting this issue out.\nEveryone who has done anything\nat all this week will know, I hope,\nhow useful they've been but\nparticular thanks to Paul for all\nthe layout designs we planned\ntogether and threw away, as well\nas the one we've ended up with.\nAndy T., who has heard this one a million times over the years I know but it is still as valid and\nsincere: ta for everything this\nweek, let's do that business\nbreakfast ya? Joe, you've, taught\nme a lesson I hope I remember.\nFinally to Jon, who really should\nknow better by now: you really\nshould know better by now...\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Helen Randall\nEditorial Assistance\nIon Jordan\nDavid Cohen\nIvan Chan\nMike Ingram\nFeatures\nPatrick Wood\nRebecca Mileham\nDavid Cohen\nloe McFadden\nIon Jordan\nMarcus Alexander\nCover Art\nThe cover was designed and drawn by Mr Jon\nJordan and produced with the help of Mr Andy\nThompson.

    "content": "Introducing le lix In the Belly of the Beast\nThey worked quickly, nimble, scalpels slicing\nacross the paunch ed, freshly shaven flesh and\nunzipping the inner organs to the. rasping air.\nThe blood was warm in places: deep within the\nanimals body, safe from the cold reality of the\noperation being performed, old organic matter\nhad tried to resist, to preserve itself, to live. And\nsome of that matter would indeed remain - but\nthose lucky cells and conglomerates of cells\nwould be chosen by the surgeons goal and not\nby stubborn life.\nWhen the. bucket by the. side, of the table\nwas nearly full (the. lungs blooming like Lilies\non the surface of the nui r ky contents) they lay\ndown their tools. The green screen on the.\nadjoining trolley displayed a yellow line and\nthe yellow line was a slow, unenthusiastic\nwave, like, a tide scared of King Kanute.. A nurses fingers flickered across the control panel. 'Its\nstill alive, she deadpanned. The, wave rose, and\nfell in a slow s to cat to. The tallest surgeon nodded and motioned to a shape in the darkness. A tray sailed out of the gloom like dead Orphelias\nfloating coffin. Arrayed on the tray were the\nreplacement organs, floating suspended in large\nglass jars of a dirty brown fluid. They were\nprimed in their inactivity: organic hand-grenades awaiting the command to explode.\nThe medical men called this command by\nattaching the pipes to pipes and fusing the nervous systems with new, cybernetic connectors.\nRed-stained switchboard operators. The work\nwas fast, but the work took an age.\nEventually the beast that lay across the\ntable sparkled with dew sprinkled guts and the\njars were all empty. The transformation was\nnear complete and as the body was strung\ntogether the tallest surgeon smiled to himself\nand to his re vitali sed feline companion. In a few days the creature would walk again, testing its\nfresh body even before it explored the hospital\ncell. Then it would be released. The new year\ncould begin.\nFELIX veteran or virgin? Whoever, welcome (back) to college and to everyone's favourite newspaper named after a cat (lets\nleave 'Pussy on the top shelf where it belongs\nshall we?) We have a few changes planned this\nyear, as bombastic ally alluded to in the little\nfairy story above, hence the summaries below.\nI know that at this time of the year the clubs\nand societies en masse are frog-marching every\nunattached soul into their offices - membership form and a pen in one hand and the\npromise of a year of unparalleled delights in the\nother - and hence it can be difficult to allocate\nyour time. But still, to anyone interested at all\nin doing anything in FELIX: come in and we\ncan talk about it (I have a big couch, a stick on\nbeard and an excellent, bedside manner...) You\ncan commit as much time as you want and it\nneed n't compete (much) with your other inter-est s. The best organisations work on synergy\nand I need as many people with a stake in the\ndrama of producing the paper as possible. Only\nwith your help can I spend vast amounts of\ntime in the bar, under the bar and being carried out of the bar! Anyway, reader or writer, I hope you like the new layout and sections and\nthat you enjoy FELIX in the months ahead.\nFeatures\nWe hope to tackle a wider range of issues this\nyear and welcome any ideas you may have\n(particularly if you can provide some information on the story \u2014 or better still become a feature writer \u2014 yourself!) Clubs and Societies\nintending to submit features are asked to consult the editor first, (and a couple of weeks in\nadvance) and work out the details together.\nClubs and Societies News\nThis section will keep you up-to-date on the\ncurrent affairs of the Unions 130+ clubs and\nsocs. We hope, for example, to provide\nadvance news of special events, report on\nimportant, changes in the administration and\npolitics of their day-to-day running and high-light, particularly outstanding achievements.\nStandBy!\nWe preview what's going on in the world of\narts, entertainment, fashion and clubs in our\ncomprehensive new review section. Student life\nin London wouldn't be impossible without it\nbut it should give you some idea how to best\nspend those, rainy days and nights...\nThe Seven Day Guide\nWhat? Have we finally managed to overhaul\nthe diary section? Well, we, hope to briefly\ncover local cinemas, the pick of the gigs,\nshows, performances and exhibitions whilst,\nstill keeping abreast of everything happening\naround Imperial.\nFELIX030 CT94 Introducing Felix\nJoining the FELIX Team\nThe. first port of call for all you inspired journalists is the FELIX office itself. A lot. of the people in there will know each other which may give a clique y impression but it. really isn't that bad once you start talking. You'll probably\nfind half the people, in the office you took to be embittered old hacks have only\njust wandered in like you! The FELIX team is drawn from such a wide spectrum of the college that it, can claim to be one, of the most cosmopolitan and\nfriendly places on campus. So don't be a scaredy cat - become a FELIX\ncat...(u rrr gh!1 can't believe I just wrote, that!)\nFreshers Fair: Find us near our office in the NorthWcst of Beit Quad.\nEditorial, news and reviewers meetings: Scan FELIX for details.\n'Keep the Cat Free'\nThe FELIX motto refers not only to the price: it refers to the\nconcept of editorial freedom. You may have noticed that die\nfellow below has has two heads. As a partially Union funded\nsociety we try to promote the Union where possible \u2014 but at\nthe same time we have to stand firm and defend the right of\nIC students to a free press. Sometimes this brings us into conflict but that is better then the alternative: a neutered Tomcat\nblindly towing the, official line...\nScience\nBest read at lunch ti in es or on the tube (what\nkind of sicko would read about physics whilst\nactually in a physics lecture?) this page will\nkeep you abreast of the movements in the\nworld of science, especially as regards our\nhumble Imperial College. Whether this will\nactually happen, or the page degenerate into a desperate re-write of Tuesday nights\nTomorrows World will depend to some extent,\non whether we can track down the enthusiastic\nbut noticeably absent Science Editor before\nthe start of term. Whither Tim? TIM V Clever\ncontributors are sort to produce a wide range\nof stories and to do the coursework assignments of hard-core hacks for a affordable,\nprice.\nIncoming\nHear the siren, see the bombs, run for shelter\nand watch the flames through the cracks in the\ncorrugated doors of the air raid shelter! Is that\nan apt metaphor for tli is, the letters page?\nThat depends on what letters we get \u2014 intellectually debates with the accuracy of an Excocet\nor ill-aimed SCUDS, we will print them all.\nThis year there will be a weekly guest editor\nmediating the, debate. They will be responsible\nfor editing down letters of an unreasonable size\n(over 200 words in most cases), adding comments of their own and generally being witty.\nIts a tall order.\nPuzzles, Gossip and Naughty Bits\nThis section, called 'Bile in the rough notes all\nsummer, is presently in limbo due. to a distinct\nlack of gossip. Normal services will hopefully\nbe restored soon and well be keeping you up-to-date on the crazy goings on of a bunch of\npeople (and their lawyers) you don't know yet\nbut will be intimately familiar with by\nDecember. In the. absence of gossip we will be\ncutting out heads from photographs of various\nUnion officers and sticking them over the.\nheads of farm animals, then distributing the\npictures to 6000 people each week. (Union\nofficers suddenly overflowing with gossip are\nreminded that the FELIX office is located in\nthe Northwest corner of Beit Quad).\nNews\nWe hope to expand the news pages this year\nand seek to make sure FELIX fearlessly covers\nevery interesting story across campus. News\nwill adorn both the front and back covers, and\ninside pages.\nReading the bound editions of previous\nyears, it. is obvious that the student body is, in\ngeneral, now much more ignorant of the activities of both Union and College personnel and\nalso more easily intimidated. Interestingly\n/ news coverage declines along with plummeting\nattendance of UG.Ms, the start, of the student\nloan era and the end of the Thatcher boom\nyears. A link could even be (tenuously) made\nwith the, launch of the staff magazine\n'Network. Is poor news coverage then\ninevitable? We intend to find out.\nOpinions: Editorials and Columns\nThe editor will be, ranting regularly enough to\nmake any further comment unnecessary and\nunflattering! In addition they'll be a range of\nregular writers talking about everything from\nscience, die Internet and the goings on at\nMary's to their latest trip to the Seven-Eleven.\nWill Harts and Cullens be, covered too? (Well,\nthat is what we call a cliff-hanger in the media\ntrade - you'll have to read to find out) Anyone\ninterested in writing a regular column should\ncome in and ask for the, editor \u2014 for more\nirregular preachers check out the soap box col-um n.( Note that, all submissions to FELIX,\neven ones which necessitate anonymous pub-li shing, must first be validated with a college\nsecurity card in case, of fraud).\n030CT94 FELIX EH\n\n"

    "content": "News feature\nRebecca Mileham takes afresh stroll down IC's own\nrejuvenated Oxford Street...\nWalking a New Way\nFrom a shelf somewhere in Beit Quad to a business with a yearly turnover now well over\nhalf a million pounds, the Union Bookstore has\ncome a long way.\n\"It's not a small concern'', confides Jill\nGibbons, who, in three years as manager has\noverseen both disasters, such as the doors\nfalling off, and triumphs, as she foresees the\nnew commercial developments along the walk-way.\nFor, flushed with its success, the Union\nBookstore lias expanded, opening a newsagent\nin the space formerly occupied by the STA student travel office, and extending by 15% the\nrange of books offered in the original shop.\n\"We'd had complaints from students and\nstaff about the lack of room in the shop\",\nexplains Jill. \"The main problem is that people\nwant to use credit, cards for book purchases,\nbut we sell a wider variety of sweets than the\nJCR and we're almost the only place that, sells\ncigarettes. The queues at lunch time can be\nhorrendous\".\nThe bookshop's proposal of a newsagent\nto fill the space left by STA was readily accepted in a vote at. the final Union General Meeting\nof last year, beating by a mile the alternative\nthrilling suggestion - an outpost of the\nEndsleigh insurance company.\n\"We should be able to get out about 70\ntitles of newspapers and magazines, along with\ncold drinks, confectionery, phone cards,\nstamps, batteries and toiletries\", she explains.\nThe length of queues will be kept down with a cash only rule in the newsagent and two tills\nrunning during lunch times.\nJill's optimism in the number of items it\nwill be possible to cram into a space the size of\na South Kensington beds it is admirable considering that the STA office moved to sunnier\nclimes further along the walkway precisely\nbecause of the claustrophobic atmosphere in its\nold premises.\n\"I don't know what the old shop was\ndesigned for, but it certainly wasn'ta travel\nagent\" says Henry Stedman, an STA travel\nconsultant and frustrated travel writer who is\ncurrently planning a trip to Madagascar.\nManager Tim Prentice goes further: \"It looked\nlike the type of place where you booked a trip\nto Paris or a bus ticket\". Offended Parisians\naside, STA hope to attract the business of the\ntravelling IC population with new services.\n\"With the new office the accent is on long haul\ntravel, although bus tickets are still available\",\nTim says - a relief to those of us who spend\nweekends in Manchester rather than\nMadagascar, although leaving long-suffering\nParisians in the lurch.\nHaving beaten off competition from\nother student travel agencies to renew its tender here, STA will be hoping to prove its worth\nby introducing a new travel library consisting\nof around fifty up-to-date guide books such as\nthose produced by Lonely Planet.\nWon't this admirable idea prejudice sales\nof the same guide books on offer in the book-store, though? Tim thinks not. \"If people want\nto look up a little bit of information, they don't buy a guide book\", he says confidently.\nSTA's new office occupies what used to\nbe a clipboard - now refitted - in which the\nJCR caterers kept \"some things\", now housed\nin a new cupboard on the left of the walkway\ndoor. Dan Look, Union Deputy President for\nFinance and Services, claims that the lost space\nin the undeniably crowded JCR has not been in\nvain: \"I think that the benefits of a larger STA\noffice with an extra member of staff far outweigh the loss of a few seats\".\nApproval for the site of the refitted office\nis even forthcoming from the contractors.\nPeering over his yellow tea mug, Ron Owen\nsays \"It's all work\", but Ian Warren takes a more pragmatic view: \"It's been very enjoyable\nworking here - good parking facilities, and food\nen suite\".\nFor those who aren't planning their next\nround-the-world trip, the presence or absence\nof a travel agency along the walkway may be\nacademic.\nAnd for those who buy one book a year\nand a snack or magazine every day, moving\nthe interesting part of the bookstore into a space less than a quarter the size could understandably be seen as a step in the wrong dire c tion.\nThe revamped bookshop will undoubtedly be more serene for those who like to\nbrowse in the electrical engineering section, but\nhave the everyday needs of students been side-lined?\nJill Gibbons feels that the proposed items\nwill fit \"very nicely\" into the newsagent space,\nand is at pains to point out the financial\nadvantages the shop offers to students because\nit. is run on a virtually non-profit making basis.\n\"We have a policy of offering all stationery\ncheaper than people could buy elsewhere, by\nchecking our prices against Smiths and\nRymans at the start and halfway through each\nterm\" she explains.\nBooks are slightly different, being subject\nto the net. book agreement which should fix the\nprice in all shops. However, as Jill says,\n\"Dillon's are known for breaking the agreement and there's now an idea that text books\nwill be cheaper there.\" She goes on, \"They can\nonly reduce the price of top ten fiction, though,\nand we've found (hat some text books are more\nexpensive at Dillon's to make up for the reduction on popular books\".\nThe most, obvious immediate change to\nthe bookshop is its new decor, and particularly\nthe new signs which enable you to get straight\nto the section you're after without becoming\nsidetracked by the Far Side cards.\nDeputy President Dan Look comments:\n\"Upgrading the bookshop means that all the\nmoney the bookshop makes is reinvested for\nthe students\".\nBookstore employees are quick to point\nout the advantages of the new hardware.\n\"We used to have metal shelves which\nlooked like DIY\", says Roy Howard, who has\nworked at the Union Bookstore in its many\nforms for 25 years. \"It was cold before; this is\nwarmer to look at, and softer\". As well as their\ntactile advantages, the new shelves won't tear\nthe covers of the books as the old ones tended\nto. They even come with a pedigree. \"We went\nto the specialists in book shelving - they've\ndone Waterstone's\", says Jill Gibbons with a contented sigh. \"It's a different atmosphere.\nEvery time I walk in I think: yes, this looks like\na bookshop\".\n030CT91 FELIX HQ\n\n"
