I screwed my eyes shut to make them come to attention but the cacophony of the quarter peal from the belfry\nsent them dancing into the sunlight coming through the open\nwindow. The quarter peal faded into the monotonous clang\nof the tenor bell and I realised there was someone at the\ndoor. I poked the wife and crawled over her to find my\nclothes under the chair. The taste of nicotine whisky was\nsour on my tongue but the bottle of Black Label was dead\non the floor.\n\"It's a hard life\" I said to the pigeon who was wondering whether the squashed pink cherries on the woman's breasts were edible, found one sock in the piss-pot, pulled my\nshoes on and fell barefoot down the stairs. The door swung\nopen with the second try and I coughed as the evening air\nmixed with the smoke in my lungs.\nThe two mob be rs came at me from either side and had\nme in the Rover before I could roll the phlegm round my\nmouth once. Big P. looked at me and said that any two bit\njournalist who tried writing him down would end up on the\nfirst flight to Amman. I stopped my hands shaking and tried\nto convince myself it was the D.T.' s again. Big P. looked at\nhis watch, said \"seven-thirty, time for bed\" and I bounced\nonto the pavement outside the Union Office.\n\"Colcutt\" I hissed at Needham, who pulled his thumb\nout of his mouth and asked me how to spell secretary. I sneered and went into the inner sanctum. Baby Jude was\npointing her breasts at nothing in particular, otherwise known\nas the Deputy President. She swung her legs from under the\ndesk and ripped her tights on the chair.\n\"It's a hard life\" I murmured as I sat down.\n\"What are you going to do about it? \" said Kirkham,\nhauling himself out of his pint pot and shoving his gut in my\nface. But I'd done it already so they opened a window and I crawled off to see my editor.\nHe was slumped on the floor of the Press Room, wrapped round a bottle of malt and groaning \"Press date tomorrow and only two pages of ads. at the printers\". The\nwispy blonde with the tight breasts bounced through the door\nand dragged him across the landing.\n\"Christ, four times in three hours, what a hard life,\" he\nscreamed across his shoulders. I was getting sick of this joke\nbut lifted the bottle of malt and reflected that one person\nkeeping his end up was enough.\nI lurched back to the Queens Tower. Designed and built\nit myself way back but the neighbourhood was going to ruin\nwith all the students around. The pigeon had gone away\nhungry and the wife was still senseless.\nThe typewriter was still in the corner where I'd left it\nfour months ago and I dragged it out and settled down to\nwrite the first scathing column of the session. The letters on\nthe typewriter blurred and my mind went black.\nTwo hours later, as I was half way through my first\nsentence, her white arms folded round my neck and pulled\nme back between her breasts. The cherry crop suddenly\nlooked good this year. I broke open a new pack of Players\nand reached for the malt. The red diamonds swirled back in\nthrough the window. The smoke burned my mouth and the\nmalt made my gut ache.\nSuddenly I felt good again.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nEditor: Dave Chant\nAssistant Editor: Tony Sims\nAll the other Assistant Editors: Tony Kirkham, Ian Catrr,\nIan Williams, John Bowman, Paul Heath, Attila the Bun\nTyping (see assistant editors)\nPhotos: John Rogers, Malcolm Bailey\nCirculation: Pete Morgans, Arnold Darby\nSports: Vacant (very)\nBusiness: Ian Quarrinton\nAnd grateful thanks to: Suzanne Hardy, Dave Rossell, Soss\nRoberts, Christine Holland, Teresa Frances Warneford\nSmart, Nicki Patel, Dick Van Schalkwyk.\nPrinted by F.

Come\nalong to the Press Room\n(top floor, Union Building)\nany Tuesday or Thursday\ndinner time and find out for\nyourself.\nTo enable our readers\nto find their way about\nall the numerous refectories in the College,\nour intrepid Felix reporter Tony Kirkham\nwas sent on an expedition to the furthermost\noutposts of Mooney,\nand reports below on\nwhat he found there.\nIn SOUTHSIDE, the main\nrefectory is the new cafe-teri a, described on the back\npage. This is intended to\nsatisfy the need for cheaper\nmeals, and better sandwich\nand salad services. This\ncafeteria is the only one open\nat weekends, and is open\nduring the following hours:\nBreakfast: 08.30 to 09.30\nLunch: 12.00 to 14.00\nSupper: 17.00 to 19.00\nAt the East end of Southside is the Staff Dining\nRoom, where you can get a waitress-served meal for\nabout 7/-. The dining hall\nhas pleasant modern decor,\nwith octagonal tables, and is\nopen at lunchtime on week-days. Although it is not yet\nopen to students, negotiations are under way to allow\nanyone in. Also for staff is\nthe Staff Buttery service in\nthe SCR bar at lunchtime.\nIn the evening during the\nweek, there will be an a la\ncarte waitress service operating in a screened-off corner\nof the new cafeteria. The\nfood here will be the same\nstandard as the old Southside evening waitress service,\nand you won't get away with\na meal under about 9/-.\nAcross Prince Consort\nRoad, in the UNION, the\nground floor cafeteria will\ncontinue to operate as in previous years, serving breakfasts from 8.30 to 9.30 and\ncafeteria meals from 12.00\nto 14.00 and from 17.00 to\n19.00. However, it will no\nlonger be open on Saturday\nmorning. Average price is\nabout 4/6 to 5/-, except for\nthe newly-introduced \"cheap\ndaily\" at 2/6 to 3/-. Although\nthe furniture is rather older\nthan in College Block, the\nqueues are invariably shor-ter.\nIn between the Union and\nSouthside lies COLLEGE\nBLOCK, which, due to its\ncentral position, tends to\nbreed long queues. All the\nfacilities in College Block\nopen during lunchtime only,\ni.e. noon until 2.00 p.m. The\nStudent Buttery on level two\nhas proved very popular, in\nfact too popular. The cause\nof the huge queues found\nthere last year was that the\npie and chips at about 3/-represented the best value\nExposed\nfor money in the College.\nThus 600 to 700 meals were\nserved in a buttery seating\n90. The opening of the new\nSouthside multi-access refectory should help ease the\nwaiting time.\nOn the ground floor of the\nbuilding is the College Block\nCafeteria, the largest refectory in IC. It is similar to\nthe Union in its services, but\nonly opens at lunchtime.\nThe decor is modern, the\nfood the best of all the cafe-teri as, but the queues very\nlong. Average price is 5/-,\nexcept the \"Cheap daily\".\nOne corner of the refectory\nis roped off to isolate the\nwaitress service, where you\nget the same food as in the\ncafeteria, but have to pay\nabout 2/- more for the wait-res ses. Also in College Block,\nthough not for students, are\nthe Staff Buttery, next door\nto the Student Buttery, and\nthe Staff Dining Room,\nwhich serves high class meals\nto members of the Senior\nAcademic Staff.\nYour intrepid Felix reporter also just managed to find\nhis way to the three bars in\nIC. These are Southside bar,\nthrough the TV room on\nthe ground floor; the Union\nbar on the ground floor of\nthe Union building; and\nCollege block bar tagged on\nto one corner of the Junior\nCommon Room on level 2\nCollege Block. The Union\nbar still clings to its men\nonly rule. College Block bar\nonly opens at lunch-time.\nThe bar hours are: 12.30 to\n14.00 and 18.00 to 23.00 during the week. On Sunday,\nonly Southside bar opens,\nand its evening opening\nhours are 19.00 to 22.00.\nStudents:\nA BarclaysCheque\nAccount is\nfree to you.

    "content": "Page Six FELIX 5th October, 1970\nIntrepid Felix explorers\nIan Carr & Roger Lindsay\nreport on their\nEuropean jaunt\nEUROPE\nLIFT A ON A DAY\nThe idea was to get to\nStockholm on as little money\nas possible, but when we had\nbeen standing by the roadside at Ostend for an hour\nor so, we began to have\ndoubts. Happily thumbing at\ndour businessmen driving by,\nwe were hailed by two more\nhitchhikers heading back\ninto town for food.\n\"How many days have you\nbeen here?\", one asked.\n\"Oh, only about half an\nhour\", we lied cheerfully.\n\"We've been here since\n5 this morning\", he said,\nequally cheerfully. It was late\nafternoon.\n\"Oh\", we said.\nWe were finally picked up\nby a German soldier who\nspoke not a word of English,\nbut took us through Belgium\nto Aachen in Germany,\nwhere we made it to the\nYouth Hostel with the aid\nof Barry, whom we met retreating from the Autobahn,\nunsuccessfully. We just\nwanted a roof over our\nheads; Barry wanted a shit,\na shower, a shag and a shave\nin that order, and guided us\nto a hostel full of English\nhitchhikers.\nAfter 4 lifts the next day\nwe were in Essen-Werden in\nthe Ruhr valley, which was\nthe first example of good\nscenery we had come across\non the continent. The youth\nhostel was marred by the\nfood: cold meat and bread,\nwhich had the flavour and\ntexture of cork table mats,\nand tea made from the local\nvegetation, but we learned\nto accept, if not eat, this during our travels in Germany.\nThe mental home which was\nholidaying at the hostel\ntended to unnerve us at first,\nbut when we had fled some\nof the friendlier inhabitants\nwe found the only other sane\nperson there, who didn't speak English. We conversed\nin broken French and shattered German, and she\ntaught us to ask drivers\nwhere they were going instead of whether they were\nfeeling OK.\nWe spent the next night in\na hostel full of school kids on holiday from Bremen. At\neleven at night Roger went\nup to see if they were dismantling the hostel around\nus, and met their English\nteacher, who offered us a lift to the Autobahn in the\nmorning if we sat in on one\nof his lessons for half an\nhour.\nShowing kids how to\nmumble with a Geordie\naccent was more interesting\nthan standing in the rain\nat the Autobahn entrance\nwith another guy who said\nhe had been there 2 days;\nafter 2 hours we believed\nhim and started walking.\nAfter much village-hopping\nand route - changing we\nreached the Y H at Hamburg which was staffed with\nrefugees from the 3rd Reich,\nStudents!\n\\$eVe got plans\nStudents of London,\nLloyds Bank has plans to keep\nyou on the right course while you're\nat college. We're giving away large-scale, detailed street maps of\nLondon to all students who open\na bank account with us.\nThese street maps have places\nof interest and Lloyds Bank\nbranches clearly marked, as well as\na comprehensive street index. The\nmaps are free of charge.\nSo are the bank accounts.\nLloyds Bank makes no charge\nfor running a student's current\naccount, provided it is kept in credit.\nSo go to your nearest Lloyds\nbranch, open a bank account and\nget your map. Then you'll be sure\nyou're always heading in the right\ndirection. Financially as\nwell as geographically.\nLloydsBanklooks after people like you Nearest branch to the College: 67/69 Old Brompton Road, S.W.9 and went out to sample the\nnight life. We can verify that\nHamburg is indeed disgusting and degenerate, so its\nworth stopping off there for\na night if you're in the area.\nWe reached Denmark and\nrediscovered the miracle of\nhot, cooked food. After hearing tales of the friendliness\nof Danish drivers to English\nhitchhikers, we were brought\ndown when we had spent 3\nor 4 hours in rain and sunshine watching the friendly\nDanes wave and smile jovially at us as they zoomed\nby. Then our luck changed\nand we went from the German border to the centre of\nCopenhagen in 2 lifts and\nless than five hours. Copenhagen youth hostel was, of\ncourse, full.\nWe moved on to Elsinore\nthe next morning, and left\nour gear there while we took\nthe ferry to Sweden. It was\nalready apparent that we\nhad neither the time nor\nmoney to reach Stockholm,\nso contented ourselves with\nreaching Sweden, which was\nexpensive and wet and\nstarted to come home. Two\ndays and ten lifts later we\nwere at Esbjerg. On the way\nwe met up at Kolding with\ntwo students we had met in\nHamburg. They had spent\nthe intervening period picking up Danish porn to take\nhome and flog in sunny\nNewcastle. A search to find\nthe night life in Kolding revealed that there weren't none, only the young\nsitting in the market square\nsmoking hash.\nAt Esbjerg we found next\nday's boat booked up, so\nwe left that evening and\nsailed home with some Danish schoolchildren, who were\nold enough to be company\nand wild enough to be fun.\nKENSINGTON UNIVERSITY ?\ncontinued from back page\nthe latter of whom presented his case for South Kensington\nTech. last term. Opposing them were Professors Ball, Coles.\nSouthwood, Skempton and others.\nIt was pointed out that independence is not solely an 1C decision. Would the University Grants Committee support\nit? The Commission on Medical Education has yet to report,\nand it may suggest joining IC and the Postgraduate Medical\nSchool at Hammersmith. Moreover, the Tory government's inquiry into Teacher Education may recommend closer links\nbetween Colleges of Education and Universities, i.e. it depends on whether the present binary system is to continue.\nMost members of the BoSt favoured decentralisation of\nUL, while retaining links. Regional groupings of the Colleges\nwould not be favoured by the smaller members of UL, as\nthey would be in danger of being swamped by the big boys.\nBasically, the advantages of retaining links with UL are\nas follows. It enables joint degrees, where the student's choice is not bound up in one College. There are the advantages of Central facilities, such as computers, audio-visual\ncentre. UL also finances central institutions, such as the\nCourtaulds Institute. Diversification could be facilitated by\nusing the departments of other UL Colleges \u2014 not possible\nif IC is a separate University. UL Colleges also collaborate\non research projects, and students collaborate via UL U and\nits clubs.\nIt was pointed out that IC already has an independence\nnot enjoyed by the other schools of UL \u2014 Lord Penney\nis on the Committee of Vice-Chancellors, and IC gets a direct grant from the UGC. Moreover, is was claimed that\nthe secessionist league was based mainly on ideas of prestige\n\u2014 i.e. making IC alone into a University of Technology.\nFrom the arguments it appears that the main disadvantages of UL are the cumbersome regulations and liberal\navailability of red tape. This tends to delay acceptance of\nnew methods of examination or new courses, and generally\nacts as a dampen er of fresh ideas.\nLord Penney pointed out that we cannot just submit that\nwe want to secede \u2014 we must also give details of the proposed future of an independent IC. He felt that there is\ntoo wide a split \u2014 as many want to leave as stay in, and\nno agreement has been reached on what to put in its place.\nAs far as IC Union is concerned, USK figures large in\nICU policy as an informal link between colleges, but it is\na cross binary group containing Colleges of Education, University College, and Technical Colleges. As such, USK is\nan ideal until a government decision is made on a scheme\nfor comprehensive Higher Education.\nThe alternatives appear to be as below:\u2014\nIC as a University of Technology, with a battle starting\nanew for diversification.\nOr a higher class Tech., at a time when the role of the\nexisting technical colleges is in question.\nI.C. Success at World\nGliding Championships\nMr. George Burton, ex-student member of Imperial\nCollege Gliding Club, was\nplaced fourth in the World\nGliding Championships held\nthis summer at Marfa,\nTexas. He was the highest\nplaced of the four British\nTeam members, a position\nwhich he held in the last\nWorld Championships in\n1968, when he came seventh.\nThere are two classes in the\nChampionships: Standard\nClass, where the span is\nlimited to 15 metres and\nother restrictions apply, and\nthe Open Class which is\ntotally unrestricted. Mr.\nBurton was competing in the\nOpen Class, and flying a Glasfliigel Kestrel 19. This\nglass fibre sail plane is a19 metre wingspan version of\nthe 17 metre production\nmodel, and was specially\nmodified for Mr. Burton by\nSlingsby Sailplanes Ltd., of\nKirkbymoorside, Yorkshire.\nThis has been a particularly successful year for Mr.\nBurton. For the third successive year he collected the\nFrank Foster Trophy,\nawarded for the fastest flight\nround a100 km. triangle in\nGreat Britain, with a speed\nof 74.4 k.p.h. Just before\nthe Championships he was\nappointed managing director\nof Slingsby's, when the firm\nwas taken over by Vickers,\nand on his return from\nTexas he came second in\nthe British Open Class\nNational Championships.\nThe K8 Kestrel at Lnsham.\n\n"

    "content": "5th October, 1970 FELIX Page Five\nPropaganda versus\nHistory\nThe theme of this, the fourth series of historical and\ndocumentary films to be shown at Imperial College, has\nbeen chosen to illustrate the conflict that exists in almost any\nfilm dealing with historical events \u2014 the conflict between\nthe historical truth it purports to describe and the motives\nand attitudes of the director who makes it.\nAt first sight it might seem that it is a conflict in which\nhistory is invariably the loser. Every historical or documentary film is propaganda for something; every director imposes his own interpretation upon the events he is dealing\nwith and thereby falsifies them. The cinema, it might be con-clude d, is of little value in studying history.\nThis is far from being the case. The historical interest\nof a film is in fact greatly increased, because the attitudes of\npeople towards events are just as much a part of history as\nthe events themselves. Thus for example the first film in this\nseries (Lenin \u2014 A Biography) provides valuable evidence\nnot only about Lenin and the Russian Revolution but also\nabout attitudes in the Soviet Union today.\nThe films chosen to illustrate the theme of this s cries can be considered in several ways. First, as a documentary\nrecord of such important historical events as the Spanish\nCivil War, and the Second World War. In this respect,\nRossif's To Die in Madrid is outstanding. Second, there is the\nquestion of their technical proficiency as propaganda. Carl\nForeman's The Victors, for example, is regarded by some as\nthe most powerful anti-war film ever made. On some topics\n(Apartheid and divided Germany) the films show how identical or closely related subjects are treated from conflicting\nand in some cases unfamiliar viewpoints. Third, there is the\ninterest of seeing the change in perspective between contemporary attitudes to an event and the attitudes of a later\ngeneration. Carl Foreman's attitude to the Second World\nWar as revealed in The Victors, for instance, is markedly\ndifferent from that of people at the time, as can be seen by\ncontrasting it with the British wartime propaganda films in\nthe previous programme.\nIt is both interesting and important to try to understand\nand account for these attitudes, why they differ, and why\nthey change with the passing of time. Hence the value of\npropaganda films in the study of history.\nProgram\nTime: 6.00 p.m. Place: Department of\nChemical Engineering\nand Chemical Technology.

The Agreement which Dunk had with the firm included a clause entitling his employers to terminate the Agreement if the apprentice was guilty of mis-conduct. Dunk attended the local\ntechnical college, he passed his first examination on the\nsecond attempt, but reports on his prospect of passing the\nsecond examination were unfavourable. The employers on\nreceiving the college report terminated Dunk's apprentice-ship. Dunk took his case to the High Court which awarded\nhim only \u00a32 nominal damages. He appealed to the Court\nof Appeal which ruled that the employers had no right to\nterminate the Agreement since Dunk had not been guilty of\nmisconduct \u2014 in that his apparent failure to reach the\nrequired standard in his academic studies was not tantamount to misconduct.

(the same al who has coauthored many scientific\npapers on diverse subjects.)\nIn spite of its name the\nSociety has no connection\nwith the life and times of\nH.G.

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 5th OCTOBER, 1970 No. 292\nTRIAL STUDENT HOTELc\na \u2122 \u00ab \" \u00ab w am Baiiey\nSCHEME SUCCESSFUL Snubs Adm, n Linstead Hall was opened\nas a hotel during the months\nof July, August and September to provide lodgings\nfor students working in London, visitors to the college\nand young people holidaying in, and passing through,\nLondon. A profit of over\n\u00a33,000 was made, which, it\nis hoped, will go towards the\ncost of converting a new\nstudent house.\nThe scheme was inaugurated to make use of the\nrooms in Hall which would\notherwise stand empty when\nnot being used for confer en ces. Only the 70 rooms on\nstaircases 2 and 3 in Linstead were used for the trial\nscheme, which was run this\nyear to examine the advantages and disadvantages of\nsuch a project. The basic\nidea was to provide accommodation for students from\nabroad and other British\nuniversities during the peak\nsummer months when\ncheap accommodation is\nvery difficult to find in London.\nThe original proposal was\nput to the welfare committee by Chris Kent and Jonathan Moont, the Halls of\nResidence rep. who went on\nto produce plans for the\nscheme and the way it\nshould be run. The whole\nproject was finally ap pro ved, with reservations, by\nthe Student Residence Committee.\nThe staff on the scheme\nwere all students from I.C., working with the co-opera-tion of Miss Smailes, the\nhousekeeper, and the permanent cleaning staff; Suzanne Hardy and Ian Carr\nwere in charge of reservations and administration,\nJonathan Moont controlled\nthe finances, and ten student cleaners were working\non a part-time basis.\nOver 500 people stayed in\nLinstead, with several parties sponsored by international student travel organisations housed in Tizard\nHall under the Accommodation Scheme's management.\nBreakfasts were provided by\nstudents during August when\nthe college refectories were\nclosed, and students also\nstood in as messengers and\nsecurity guards at weekends\nMrs. Caroline WardBailey, who has been employed by the College in various posts concerned with\nthe widening of courses at\nI.C., has declined to continue working for the College as aide to the revised\nAssociated Studies Office.\nCaroline was originally\nwhen none were provided by\ncollege security. The scheme\nran without major mishaps\nand nearly all available\nrooms were occupied throughout the three months;\nthe major proportion of\nguests were foreign students\nand foreign university staff\nvisiting the college.\nI.C. students who applied\nfor residence last term were\nhoused in Student Houses\nand the halls of residence\nnot in use for conferences.\nThe rent for staying under\nthe accommodation scheme\nwas \u00a36 per week, but it is\npossible that next year there\nwill be lower rates for holders of International Student Identity Cards and\nmore expensive rates for\nnon-students.\nThe main conclusions to\nbe drawn from the scheme\nwere that permanent cleaning staff should be employed rather than part-timers: rooms should only\nbe let to people unconnected with University or college for a maximum of one\nweek ; non-students should\nonly be allowed to take\nrooms if there are no students asking for them.\nThe continuation and possible extension of the scheme\nnext year will depend on the\nenthusiasm of more students\nto organise and run it, on\nthe Halls of Residence rep.,\nwho is yet to be elected,\nand, of course, on the continued approval of the Students Residence Committee.\nThe great demand for rooms\nand requests for reservations\nfor next year has already\nshown that all possible\navailable accommodation is\nneeded for young people\nduring the summer.\nMooney\nprice increases\nPaced with a deficit on the running of the Refectories\nover the past year of over \u00a328,000, the Refectory Committee\nhas had no option but to raise all Refectory prices by 15%.\nMoreover, the differential between cafeteria and waitress\nservice meals has been steeply increased, and the upper Dining Hall in the Union has been closed altogether.\nThe price increase, taking for example a3/6 meal to\n3/11, was decided upon when the loss was believed to be\nabout \u00a310,000 and was designed to make the refectories\nbreak even next year. However, with the true figures now\nknown, it appears that it will be some years until the deficit\nis paid off.\nFalling Customers\nAt the Refectory Committee meeting, Refectory Manager\nVictor Mooney explained how the deficit arose. Firstly, food\nprices have gone up by an average of 9% in the past year,\nthough beef is up by 17%. The Refectory Committee, following its policy of fixed prices throughout the year, has\nborne this extra cost without passing it on. Also, the opening\nof College Block has added \u00a314.000 to the wages bill, without the increased turnover to compensate. Further contributory causes are the uneconomic waitress service Dining\nHalls, and a falling number of customers. The latter is partially due to the successful boycott of Southside Lower Refectory (now closed) following the cockroach incidents reported in Felix 284 last January. The boycott is estimated\nto have caused \u00a32.000 to \u00a33,000 loss to the Refectories.\nUpper Union Closed\nThe Committee also decided to close entirely the waitress\nservice in the Union upper Dining Hall, although it will still\nbe book able for formal evening dinners. The waitress services\nhave been under-used and this is bound to get worse after\nthe recent price increases. Faced with a choice between\nclosing the Union Dining Hall or the Southside Staff Dining\nHall, it was more economic to close the former. This is because the Union Dining Hall has its own separate kitchen, requiring additional staff, whereas all Southside refectories\nwill be served by the one kitchen.\nThe closure of the Union waitress service has brought protests from club officials who have to entertain guest speakers\netc., to lu noh. This problem also applies to Technicians and\nother College employees. Therefore the Refectory Committee and I.C. Union are recommending to the Senior Common\nRoom Committee that the Staff Dining Room in Southside should be opened to all. This would not cause great annoyance to the staff, as the price would normally deter students from eating there.\nIn the meantime, students faced with the problem of\nwhere to take guests to lunch are advised to find a member\nof staff to sponsor them as guests in the Staff Refectories.\nMoreover, if a member of staff cannot be found, Domestic\nBursar Carl Seaford has offered to sponsor any bona-fide\nstudent officials, if they contact him in advance via his of-f ice. dismissed when the College\ndecided to run down Associated Studies last June. Under pressure, however, the\nCollege reversed its decision\nand decided to offer Mrs.\nWard-Bailey a clerical post.\nIn a calculated (and well-deserved) snub to the College, she has turned down\nthis offer.\nThe interest in course\nbroadening at I.C. was largely fostered by the late\nPro-Rector, Lord Willis\nJackson, to whom Caroline\nWard-Bailey was research\nAssistant. Until his untimely death last year, Lord\nJackson's stature and influence ensured the progress,\nalbeit slow, towards greater\ndiversification, despite the\nfact that the majority of\nProfessors here prefer the\nold-fashioned narrow-min-ded Degree Factory treat-ment.\nAfter Lord Jackson's de-mise, the reactionary elements in the College lost no\ntime in gathering forces and\nstarted to run down the\nAssociated Studies Office.\nMrs. Ward-Bailey was dismissed on the grounds that\nthere was no structure for\nher to fit in!\nThis backwards trend\nbrought an immediate outcry from students and some\nstaff, and under strong pressure from I.C. Union and\nthe Assoc. Studies Committee, the College was forced\nto back down.\nHowever, Mrs. WardBailey was only offered a post as a Senior Clerk, and\nshe felt that this did not\ngive the job the status it\nneeded or deserved. Internal status politics prevented\nthe post being up-graded to\nan administrative scale. Furthermore, it was obvious\nthat the College had only\nbacked down under pre s sure, and that the reactionaries would try and force\nclosure of her proposed\noffice as soon as they\nthought they could get away\nwith it. Therefore Caroline\nthought that she could not\naccept the post, and will instead seek a job with less\nin-fighting and a more secure\nfuture.\nThe hounded Associated\nStudies Committee has now\nto find someone as capable\nand as determined as Caroline, to carry on this important work. The Union has\nrequested, and been offered,\nrepresentation on the selection panel for Mrs. WardBailey's successor.\n\n"

    "content": "5th October, 1970 FELIX Page Three\nAs you no doubt know by now, I.C. is\ncomposed of three smaller colleges and Imperial\nCollege is these three stuck together.\nSoss Roberts discusses the\nConstituent College\nUnions\nHowever, it isn't just as\nsimple as that, because there\nare thus four colleges and\nhence four students' unions.\nThe Presidents of the three\nconstituent college unions\n(CCU's) are automatically\ntangled up into the workings\nof the all-embracing Imperial College Union (ICU).\nEach of the four Unions has\nits separate meetings and\nevery student at IC is eligible to go to two of them:\nICU, and his particular\nCCU. Since ICU, to the public at large, is more important than any particular\nCCU, most serious Union\nmatters are discussed at ICU meetings and the lighter stuff\nand sports are left to the\nCCU's. Many people at IC,\nespecially the Lefties, are\nagainst the very existence of\nthe CCU's on the grounds\nthat four Unions cause four\ntimes as much chaos and require four times as many\nplaces in Hall, than one\nunion; and the CCU's encourage and propagate the\ndecadent Rugby Club/Union\nBar / Piss-Artist / Fascist\nclique. On the other hand\nmany other people, especially\nmembers of this latter clique\n(i.e. anybody not a Leftie)\nare all for CCU's on the\ngrounds that some difference\nis necessary for sporting and\nsocial purposes.\nDIFFERENCES To enable you to recognise your own C CU if you\nstumble across it accidentally\nthe basic differences between\nthe three CCU's are as fol-lows. R CSU is composed of\npure scientists, C& GU of\nengineers, and R SMU of\nmining and metallurgy stu-dents. The student populations are respectively about\n1700, 1700, and 500, and\nsince each Union receives\nabout the same grant from\nthe Powers that Be, it is\nobvious that R SMU spends\na lot more money per capita\nthan the other two CCU's. It\nso happens that all Miners\nare the same sort of people\n\u2014 they play rugby, swim in\nbeer, and don't like Lefties,\nand are therefore members\nof the R C/UB/ PA/F clique.\nIn fact, informed sources\nassert that this clique is\nreally R SMU in disguise,\nand vice versa. You only\nhave to go to an R SMU meeting to see for yourself\n(but don't get recognised if\nyou're not a member of\nRSMU); and because of this\nhomogeneity R SMU is a very strong Union \u2014 much\nmore so than R CSU and\nC& GU. Often it appears\nthat the whole C CU system\nis being held up by RSMU's stability.\nThe other two Unions have\na fair proportion of sporting members but quite a few\nLefties as well \u2014 but since\nLefties don't believe in\nCCU's we can forget about\nthem for the purposes of this\ndiscussion. In spite of their\ngreater size R CSU and\nC& GU are very apathetic\n\u2014 about as bad as ICU it-self, which at times seems\nthe very paragon of apathy.\nIn sport R CSU and C& GU are about equal. But what\nmakes R CSU better than\nC& GU( and what makes\nit obvious who is writing\nthis) is that each C CU produces a Broadsheet, and\nGuilds' Sheet is a rather\nsorry - looking publication,\nowing to general apathy and\nhence lack of contributors.\nThe RCS Broadsheet is very\npopular within RCS and is\nrun by a few hard-working\npeople; the Mines Newsletter is very good and is\nrun by more hard-working\npeople. These sheets are the\nequivalent of Felix on aCC U scale, but are NOT intended to oust Felix, which\nis the paper of ICU and\nhence more necessary than\nC CU sheets; rather do they\nattempt to keep O CU members in touch with their\nUnion. They only exist because they are popular, and\nmost serious IC news\nappears in Felix.\nIn order to distinguish\nthemselves audibly on occasions when rival colleges\nmeet, each C CU has a chant\nwhich will be taught to\nfresher s at the Freshers\nUnion Meetings on Tuesday\nat 1.15. RCS chant a Swahili\nobscenity which begins Kangela Armedola (need I say\nmore?), Guilds have the\nBoomalaka, and all Mines\ncan manage is a bellowed\n\"MINES\"( but then it\ndepends on how loud they\nbellow it). To distinguish\nthemselves visibly each C CU has a mascot \u2014 RCS have\nTheta, at present of unknown whereabouts, C&G Spanner, and RS M Davy\nLamp. There are also inviolate mascots, consisting of\nvintage motor vehicles: Jezebel, Boanerges and Clementine respectively.\nObviously as a member of\nonly one C CUI' m biased.\nYou can see for yourself\nwhat your C CU is like; each\nC CU is meeting at 1.15 tomorrow and ICU meets on\nThursday at 1.15.\nThere are some good\nheavy politics at ICU and\nmuch lighter stuff at C CU Register\nyour\nvote\nUnder a recent Court of\nAppeal ruling, on a test case\nin May financed by NUS,\nstudents can now register to\nvote in their College constituencies. The Court ruled that students in Hall, lodgings, or\nflats could be regarded as\nresidents in that const it u en cy, as well as in their home\nconstituency. But they must\nregister whilst at College,\nand the registration formalities take place this month.\nA student, incidentally, is entitled to vote if he will be\n18 by 15th February.\nICU President Judith\nWalker is distributing publicity in an attempt to inform\nstudents of these recent\nchanges in the law. It is im-port ant, also, that landladies\nare informed at once, as the\nregistration forms are filled\nin by them.\nThe court also laid down\nthat a person may be \"res i dent\" at more than one\nplace, so students should\nstill be registered at their\nhome address by their par-ents.\nWhen a person is resident\nin two places, then he may\nvote in BOTH places for\nlocal elections and parliamentary by-elections, provided the two places are in\ndifferent local authorities or\nconstituencies.\nHowever, he may only\nvote ONCE in a General\nElection and stiff penalties\nawait those who do vote\ntwice.\nStudents are also entitled\nto postal votes, and should\napply to the Electoral Registration Officer for form Q, without delay.\nThe local IC constituency\nis the Cities of London and\nWestminster. At the last ele c tion, the candidate who won\nby a huge majority was \u2014\nwould you believe it \u2014 the\nTory.\nYou lucky people can\nnow find out how Felix\nis prepared and edited\nby watching out for the\nFelix stand in College\nBlock this afternoon\n(Junior Common Room\n\u2014 NE corner).

If you really\ncan't make it then the meetings are reported in Felix\nand the Broadsheets. Have\nfun.\nI.G. Optical Systems Ltd.\nThe Governors of Imperial College have approved\na proposal to establish a small company within the\nCollege called \"IC Optical\nSystems Ltd\". The main objective is to make highly\nspecialized optical instruments and components, requiring the investigation of\nnew methods of design,\nmanufacture, mounting and\ntesting.\nThe capital will be subscribed jointly by the College, Technical Development\nCapital Ltd.

This committee, set up by UL, is chaired by\nLord Murray of Newhaven.\nThe Rector's paper itself said little, and proposed few\nconcrete changes in the UL structure. It comprised mainly\nwoolly statements like reform of the membership of the UL Senate. Although this is theoretically the supreme academic\nbody, it is really a rubber stamp for the decisions of its\nstanding committees, such as Academic Council and Collegiate Council. Also, he wants a broadening of the membership of Senate standing Committees \u2014 at present most of\nthese bodies are composed of members already on Senate,\nand IC is not represented as such an Academic Council.\nPenney also advocated reduction in the powers of Convocation.\nNO STAMP The paper also made comments on such matters as student\nand junior staff participation, external degrees, the UL schools Examinations Council, and Court (which controls\nfinances).\nThe comment on participation stressed college-based\nrepresentation. However, ICU has asked that this be extended to state that participation is necessary also at the\nfederal level.\nFor once, Board of Studies members would not just\nrubber-stamp the proposals \u2014 their comments are to be\nincorporate in a further document, and the Rector will give\nLord Murray both his own opinions and those expressed\nat the BoSt, in October, and will report back in December.\nSECEDE Various members of the Board then voiced their opinions\nthat IC should secede from the University of London. The\nsecessionists were led by Professors Spalding and Ubbehlode,\n(Continued on P.6) NEW STYLE REFECTORY\nA completely new\ntype of refectory is to\nopen shortly in the\nground floor dining\nroom, Southside, to replace the basement\ncafeteria and the snack\nbar. The new refectory\nwill serve a wide range\nof foods, with better\nfacilities for cheap\nmeals than before.\nLast year, the basement\ncafeteria made a disastrous\n\u00a313,000 loss, due to a decline in the numbers wanting\ncafeteria type meals.

The Southside Cafeteria will serve a large range of meals, including salads, sandwiches, pie\nand chips, and hot cafeteria\ntype meals. The layout is a multiple access arrangement,\nthe customer walks to join\none of the four queues at the\nfour main counters, and\nafter getting his meal goes\nstraight to one of the three\ncash desks. In this way there\nshould be no long queue\ntrailing round all the counters, and so service should be\nfairly fast.\nThe design of the cafeteria is very flexible \u2014 it will\nbe very easy to extend one\ncounter and reduce another\nif one type of meal is more\npopular than another, and\nit is possible that changes\nwill be made as soon as it\nbecomes clear what customers prefer.\nThe kitchens will now be\non one level only, with the\nnew cafe and the staff dining room behind it, as\nopposed to the former two-level kitchens. This will\nmake Southside more economical to run.\nIn the evening, the full\nrange of services should\nagain be available. In addition a corner of the dining\nhall will be screened off and\nan a la carte waitress service\nwill be provided here. This\nwill be similar to the previous Southside evening\nwaitress service dining hall,\nbut of smaller capacity.\nFor the moment, the snack\nbar and basement cafeteria\nwill be put into mothballs. In\na few years time, thought\nwill be given to re-opening\nthem to cope with the expected increase in numbers\nof students.

The search for a suitable group is of paramount importance.\nWithin this context a hundred different student organisations clam our for attention during the mad afternoon of\nFreshers' Day; and con in ue to do so through badly-duplicated\ncirculars or over-size posters for the next few weeks. In the\nmidst of this a fresh-faced naive-looking representative of\none of the Christian societies may invite you, rather coyly,\nto some re lg io us event; to a lunchtime meeting, or church\non Sunday. You refuse, and why not. Church is something\nthat may, or may not, have happened at home, and is very\ndefinitely middle-aged, middle-class, and irrelevant. You're\nright. It is\u2014nearly always.\nHowever, because you've come to Imperial College, you\nare now part of an experiment about what the church today\ncan be.\nYou may still be encountered by the fresh-faced naive-looking representative ritualistic ally exhorting you to go to\nchurch, but that is because we have not got rid of all our\ntraditions yet. No-one really expects to recruit a church-full\nof converts at a Freshers Day stall. The representative may\nnot be quite so fresh-faced or naive-looking either. Some of\nthe people in the church at Imperial are left-wing radicals,\nand others, with whom they uneasily rub shoulders, are\nright-minded rugby club members.\nThe reason that people are not concerned about your\ngoing to church is that there is no church to go to. The real\nlife of the church takes place in departments and halls of\nresidence where people are. Every week several hundred\npeople meet in small groups on different days and in different places to discuss, to plan action, to share a meal together,\nand, almost always, to celebrate holy communion. This is\nthe church in Imperial College, or most of it. There are still\ndenominational groups, and there is also a rather separatist\nChristian Union, but their members often join in these hall\nand department groups.\nThis experiment about what the church is all about was\nstarted, rather unknowingly, by the Church of England.\nTwelve years ago they appointed Ivor Smith-Cameron.-as full time chaplain to the colleges in West London, and it is\nhe who has been largely responsible for these developments.\nBcause he is an Anglican minister some people still label\nthese activities 'Anglican Chaplaincy' but few people regard them as exclusively Anglican or feel the name is very\nrelevant.\nThe important thing is that it is the church in action. To\nbe sure, there is enormous confusion sometimes about what\nthe action should be, and equal confusion about what the\nchurch is. But it doesn't stop people thinking and acting.\nOver 200 people pray and worship in small groups every\nweek, and a lot of social action is taken. Last year \u00a31000\nwas collected to send to a member of the church now working\nin ale pra so rium in India. Many people help run youth clubs,\ncare for vagrants in the East End, organise work-parties to\ndecorate old people's rooms, and so on. There are also those\nwho ponder the usefulness of such a melior at ive measures\nand wonder if greater political involvement is not called for.\nThere was a course run last year when this was discussed.\nPeople also learn and discuss theology, and discover that\nsome of it is more relevant than they thought.\nIf any of this interests you, you don't have to do anything\nabout it. Certainly there is a eucharist held every Sunday\nin College Block where people from all the groups worship\ncommunally, but you do not have to search for this. You\nare bound to meet someone who belongs to the invisible\nchurch.\nARTHUR FRANCIS Checks'* and Cheques With an increasing number of outsiders illegally using the\nCollege bars, particularly Southside, precautions are to be\ntightened up to ensure that only those entitled to use the\nbar are doing so.\nI.C.U. Deputy President Tony Kirkham has threatened\nto hold card checks to ensure that the law is being complied\nwith. The list of people entitled to use the bars is given in\nthe Union Blue Book.\nFormer students may only use the bar if they are Life\nMembers of the Union. The fee for this is \u00a33, and application forms are available from Janet Hughes in the Union\nOffice.\nAfter several incidents last year when cheques cashed\nin Southside bar were found to be distinctly rubbery, the\narrangements for cashing cheques in the bars have been\ntightened up. Mr. Mooney has requested the barmen only\nto cash cheques which are presented along with ab, ank card.\nContrary to all expectations this year's Scout and\nGuide Club summer expedition went not to Iceland, but\nto Austria. The reason was\nan Icelandic general strike.\nThe area hastily chosen for a visit is called the StUkai\nAlps and lies south of Innsbruck.\nTransport consisted of a hired Landrover .and a yellow Thames van, better\nknown as the \"Passion\nWagon\". The journey down\nwas uneventful except when\nthe passion wagon's gearbox jammed more solidly\nthan usual. However, with a little persuasion\u2014taking all\nday\u2014this was cured.\nAlthough the site of the\nbase camp, on the bank of\nie Ruetzbach river, was\nfound by accident, it\nappeared to be well known\nto many Germans, and,\nmore important, was free.\nFrom this base camp operated in groups of four or\nfive.\nOne group, led by Mike\nGarrett, set off for a three\nday visit to Sulzenau Hutte.\nThis eventually turned out\nto be a nine day stay, during\nwhich time they climbed\nfour peaks.\nThe first day at the hut\nwas spent quietly climbing\nTrogler (9520 feet). The\nview from the top convinced\nthem that the area had far\nmore climbing to offer than\nanyone had anticipated.\nConsequently everyone else\nclimbed to the hut two\nCricket\nClub\nThe college cricket club\nruns at least three eleven's, catering for all standards,\nthose who are already experienced players and those\nwho are willing to learn.\nLast year the l st eleven had\na successful season, winning\nthe U.L. U. colleges knockout cup. The second and\nthird elevens did not have\nas much success, but they did\nat least enjoy their cricket.\nIn the summer term\ngames are played on Saturdays and Wednesdays. Winter nets are available\n(mainly for fresher s) every\nSunday during the first two\nterms when members can\nbenefit from the professional\ncoaching available. The season is rounded off with a* ten\nday tour of Devon immediately after the summer term.\nOn the tour an excellent time\nis had by all both on and off\nthe field.\nAnyone interested should\ncontact the U.C. cricket club\ntoday, or give their names\nto Russ Smith (via Maths\nletter rack) or Chris Potter\n(Chemistry).\nScout and Guides\nsummer expedition\ndays later. Their second day|\nwas spent climbing Wilder\nFreiger (11,250 feet). An early start of three thirty in\nthe morning was necessary\nas most of the climb was up\na glacier, the surface of\nwhich melted and became\ndifficult to cross in the sun.\nAs it was the start was late\nand the climb took nearly\nseven hours, twice as long\nas they expected.\nOn the same day those at\nbase camp had climbed\n5000 feet to the top of\nGreit Spitze. The climb was\neasy, up grass covered\nslopes. The route down.\nhowever, was chosen for ex-cite ment; Mike Gibson\nscared everyone stiff when\nhe slipped two feet from the\nedge of a200 feet vertical\ndrop.\nUnfortunately, the weather now changed from sunshine to cloud and rain. Two\nattempts at the Zuckerhutl\nwere called off but both\nMaierspitze and Trogler\nwere climbed. The day we\nhad decided to return to\nbase Mike Garratt's group\nconquered the Zuckerhutl\n(11500 feet), the highest\npeak in the area.\nOne group of five decided\nto go on a hike for the remaining four days. They\nwere given a lift as far as\nMatrei, and from there\nwalked up a side valley. The\nfirst night was spent camped\nin a military exercise area\nand on the second day they\ntramped through the middle\nof an army camp\u2014nobody\nseemed to mind.\nAnother group, the Gibson \u2014 van Schalkwyk circus\u2014climbed to Tribulaun\nHutte. The idea was to climb\npeaks requiring rock climbing skill. Unfortunately a combination of bad we a th er, ver glassed rock and\nrock falls prevented them\nfrom reaching their main\nobjective. All the same, four\nsubsidiary peaks were conquered during their four day\nstay.\nSomething to applaud this time. Britain's most impressive demonstration of books for students. Over 120,000 books always in stock.\nTHE STUDENTS BOOKSHOP IS AT\nCLAUDE GILL BOOKS LTD\n481 Oxford Street, London, W.1. One minute from Marble Arch near Selfridges.\nQ. How to get there?\nA.
