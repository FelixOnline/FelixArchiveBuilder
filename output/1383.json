What I\u2019m trying to say\nis I need help, help I tell you! We need\na new nightlife editor for Felix, you\ndon\u2019t need to have any past experience\nor even be able to write in English, all\nwe need is someone to help make the\npages, if you\u2019re interested then I suggest you send me an email at nightlife.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk and we\u2019ll start\ntraining you up!\nNow I\u2019ve got that out the way, we can\nstart on something relevant. I went out\nlast night to a club called Panic! Just off\nOxford street, it\u2019s recently become a\nfavoured club of scenester teenagers in\nLondon so I thought I\u2019d hate it, but for\nthe first time in my life, I was wrong!\nI\u2019ve been regularly visiting Panic for\nthe past four years, and when it first\nstarted, I must say it was total shit, but\nit\u2019s improved so much recently I\u2019ve decided to actually write a review on it,\nwhich you can read by rotating your\neyes or head slightly to the right. Unless you\u2019re reading this paper upside\ndown in which case, rotate to the left.\nAs for other content, we\u2019re a bit thin\non the reviews front, by that I mean\nnobody has actually written any for us.\nThis may be partly my fault for not organising the reviewers, but I\u2019m going\nto blame George Bush instead. If you\nfancy going to the most awesomea-saurus-rexical clubs in London then\nemail in! It\u2019s all free don\u2019t you know.\nOf course, you can also visit the worst\nclubs in London if you like that sort of\nthing, but I generally reserve them for\nmyself because I like to punish myself,\nand I\u2019m also too much of an arsehole\nto be able to write a nice review, the\nwords just don\u2019t fit together.\nFinally, I\u2019ve got to mention the com-petitions. Enter the fucking things already you bunch of ungrateful bastards\nor I\u2019ll never, ever EVER get you prizes\nagain.\nNext time you find yourself queueing\nup in the rain to pay \u00a315 to get into a\nclub, remember reading this column.\n13 Years of Bugged Out-ness\nSimian Mobile Disco, Boys Noize, D.I.M and Jojo De Freq are sure to deliver an\nawesome thirteenth birthday party for the legendary Bugged Out clubnight\nGregory Mead\nnightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNightlife\nNightlife Editor \u2013 Greg Mead\nThirteen years of Bugged out is nearly\nupon us, the legendary clubnight, originally based at Sankeys in Manchester\nwill be celebrating their birthday at The\nEnd on Saturday 20th October! Unfortunately that\u2019s the day after this issue of\nFelix is printed, but that\u2019s just the way\nthe universe works at the moment, but\nif you do manage to catch it, you\u2019re in\nfor a real treat, every single Bugged\nOut I\u2019ve been to has been awesome.\nOne reason they are so successful is\nthey run monthly, meaning they never have a dry night like other similar\nclubs such as Our Disco and DURRR,\nthe monthly format allows them to\nconstantly offer big name acts in the\nelectro scene at their current home,\nThe End.\nThis is a perfect venue for such an\nevent, the DJ booth and stage are\nopen, and not elevated, making for\nmuch more of a friendly atmosphere\nand more interaction between the\npeople dancing and the DJ\u2019s or bands\nperforming. No super-DJ\u2019s in a booth\ntwenty feet off the ground here.\nOccasional one off large events such\nas the Bugged Out Warehouse parties at Canvas and various locations\nin East London are also a real treat. Irregularly organised they offer really big\nname acts in a larger (usually 2000+)\nvenue, making for an almost festival\nexperience.\nThe birthday party will be headlined\nby Simian Mobile Disco, riding on the\nwave of popularity from recent \u2018nurave\u2019 bands and a sudden increase of\nelectronic music in indie circles, they\nare now regularly playing high up on\nthe line up for massive events and festivals around the UK, so catching them\nhere will be a real treat.\nMy personal highlight of the night is\nBoys Noize, I first heard a few tracks by\nthis German electro producer a year or\nso ago and instantly loved them. I was\nCompetitions\nIt\u2019s still not too late to win some\nprizes. We have:\nTwo Fabric double passes for\n24th, 25th and 26th October.\nThree double passes for Turnmills at their Halloween special\non 27th October.\nEmail:\nnightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nalso lucky enough to catch him play a\ncrazy set at Pukkelpop festival in Belgium this summer. The 5000 capacity\ntent was totally rammed and the atmosphere was truly amazing. He\u2019ll also\nbe releasing his debut album \u201cOi Oi\nOi\u201d on the night, featuring hits such as\n\u201cDon\u2019t Believe the Hype\u201d and \u201cDown\u201d\nAlso playing in the main room is\nvintage house artist JoJo De Freq, who\nis unveiling some new material from,\namongst others, Miss Kittin. D.I.M.\nwill also play live, following the success\nof the brilliant \u201cAirbus Baby\u201d.\nThe warm up is Matt Walsh, who was\nimpressive at the Bugged Out night at\nthe T Bar in May. In the lounge Herve\nwill be joined by Hannah Holland,\nfrom Trailer Trash and Bastard Batty\nBass. Klaxons and Simian tour (and\nOur Disco resident DJ) Nadia Ksaiba\nwill be joined by a competition winner,\nchosen by BuggedOut, to warm up the\nlounge.\nCompleting this spectacular line up\nin AKA is Wet Yourself, who enjoyed\nsuccess at Shoreditch Sunday, with resident DJ\u2019s Cormac, Peter Pixzel, Husley\nand Gunz.\nBasically, it\u2019s going to be one hell of a\nnight, so I suggest you get to The End\nearly on Saturday night. You\u2019d better\nnot all turn up too early and fill the\nplace out though, because I\u2019ll be extremely annoyed if I get there and I\ncan\u2019t get in.\nZOMG-OMFG I\u2019m going to Panic!\nEntirely populated by 18 year old students, this is the perfect place for freshers (or\ncreepy guys who like 18 year old girls). Panic! is fast becoming \u2018super Indie cool\u2019\nThe fact that this club is populated\nalmost entirely by teenage students\n(and a few weird old guys who look\nlike they\u2019d like to do bad things to said\nFemale teenage students) and the fact\nthat bottles of Kronenberg cost \u00a31.50\nand double vodka and mixer \u00a32.50,\nthis club night was always destined to\nbe a complete mash up, and it almost\nalways ends that way.\nWhen I first started going to this\nclub, back in the old days before I was\neven a fresher, it was a little lame and\nunpopular (just like I was) and to be\nhonest the music they played was not\nat all to my taste, not that it mattered\nsince I usually got through an obscene\namount of cheap booze in the first few\nhours.\nNow, four years later it\u2019s so packed\nthere\u2019s a 30 minute queue just to get in,\nand it\u2019s fast becoming almost as popular as DURRR to the indie scenester\nkids.\nThey play a great selection of current\nalternative music, as well as old Indie\nand new electro, and it\u2019s so popular\nthe dancefloor is rammed from about\n10pm till closing time at 3am.\nThe main problem for me though is I\ndon\u2019t particularly like hanging around\nwasted sixth formers and freshers,\nthey can get extremely irritating and\nhave also resulted in the place ID-ing\nevery single person who enters and\nrefusing entry to anybody who doesn\u2019t\nhave any. Including myself and a friend\n(25 years old) on one occasion who had\nno ID, which was totally ridiculous.\nThe fact that everyone is trashed also\nmeans spilled drinks, smashed bottles and passed out people all over the\ndancefloor, making for a rather sticky,\ncrunchy and sometimes soft surface to\nwalk on.\nThe toilets are an offence to every\nsingle one of my senses and entering them borders suicidal, last week\na bunch kids decided to overflow the\nsink, whilst wrapping their entire bodies with toilet paper, along with some\nguy who was standing in the corner\nwith no trousers on pissing all over the\nwall, who promptly walked back out\ninto the club with no trousers on. Security were not impressed, and neither\nwas I.\nSo, you\u2019re probably reading this now\nand thinking something along the lines\nof \u2018Why the fuck would I ever want to\ngo to this place, it sounds awful\u2019. Well,\nif you\u2019re thinking that, then probably\nyou\u2019re wrong, despite the few points\nI mentioned in this review, I can\u2019t say\nthis place is all that bad, in fact I went\nthere last night and it was a really great\nnight out, plus I barely spent any money at all.\nThe fact that they now play music I\nactually like means I don\u2019t have to get\ntotally off my face on booze to enjoy\nmyself, and the nice seated areas mean\nyou can sit down and actually talk to\npeople.\nSo, if you\u2019re feeling bored on a Tuesday night, and like most people have\nthe day off on Wednesday, then perhaps you should give this place a visit.\nIn fact, you probably do anyway, since\nthe place is full of Imperial College students every single week. Just don\u2019t go\nin the mens toilets.\nGregory Mead\nBoys Noize and Simian Mobile Disco, meet them on Saturday and say hello\n\n"

If you are between 18-21 years old the minimum\nwage is \u00a34.60 an hour\nIf you are getting paid below these\namounts you may well be being treated\nunfairly and should seek advice from\nthe Information and Advice Centre\n(IAC).\nWorking time regulations \u2013 There\nis a limit of 48 hours of working in a\nweek.\nThere is a limit of 8 hours work every\n24 hours for night workers.\nNational Insurance Numbers \u2013 Everyone needs a national insurance\nnumber to work in this country, please\ncontact the IAC for details on how to\nget one of these.\nUnfair dismissal \u2013 Your employer\nmust follow a set down procedure before you get the sack. For example, if\nyou get sacked and your employer says\nit because you can\u2019t do your job prop-erly, were you given official warnings\nbefore this?\nUnions \u2013 It is a good idea to join a\ntrade union even as a student they may\nbe able to help if there are problems\nwith your part- time work.\nThe Information and Advice Centre\ncan also help with any questions about\nyour rights you might have.\nFinal note, part-time work may be a necessity for you to survive at University\nbut remember to try to strike a balance\nworking that amount of hours and balancing study and a social life!\nAlso as a part-time worker it is important that you do not get treated\ndifferently from full time staff, in the\nPart-time workers regulations 2000 it\nstates the following rights for part time\nworkers:\n- The same hourly rate of pay as full\ntime workers.\n- Overtime pay at the same rate if they\nhave worked full time hours.\n- Not to be treated less favourably with\nregard to issues such as sickness pay\nand maternity leave.\n- Have the same access to training as\nfull time workers\nAlthough part-time work is now a part\nof many students life it is important to\nnot become overworked and to ensure\nthat your are not ignoring your studies\nand taking up hours or a job that starts\nto impact on your academic career.\nThis article is a general guide on Parttime workers rights, if you feel you\nneed more detailed advice please do\nnot hesitate to contact us.\nIf you look around your lecture thea-tre, common room or wherever you\nhappen to be sitting reading this marvellous contraption you will no doubt\nsee people who are different from you.\nThey have similar aims and aspira-tions. They are your (approxi-mate) intellectual equals.\nHowever, they have all\nbeen brought\nby very\ndifferent backgrounds and\nexperiences to\nwhere they are to-day. Consequently\ntheir experience of\nImperial will vary\ndrastically from yours,\nfrom the person sitting\nnext to them and from\nthe person writing this\narticle.\nIf this is the case how can\none person represent the individual needs and interests of every person at Imperial? (If someone can answer that question I would be keen to\nknow\u2026) If there was one person capable of representing every minority, be\nit on issues of race, gender, sexuality or\nmoral agenda then they would be very\nfar placed from \u2018random student\u2019 and\nprobably just as hypothetical. If every\nperson sat near you is so very different\nthen how will your individual needs\never be represented?\nIt is of course impossible to represent\nevery student individually. Stereotypes\nare inescapable in these issues but can\nhelp to make sure that there is a channel for certain issues to be escalated.\nOver the course of the next few weeks\nthe Representation and Welfare Board,\nchaired by the Deputy President (Edu-cation and Welfare), that\u2019s yours truly,\nwill be looking to co-opt members to\nlook\nafter\nand champion\ncertain issues that will relate to our\nmembers needs. These positions are\nknown as \u2018campaigns portfolios\u2019 and\nhave been allocated to six specific re-mits. We are of course open to further\nsuggestions and by no means is this\nmeant to be a limiting factor. Each\n\u2018portfolio\u2019 can be allocated to two people and one person can hold up to three\nportfolios at any time. You don\u2019t have\nto be a member of RWB to be allocated\na portfolio and you don\u2019t have to run\nin an election. To put it simply, if you\nare enthusiastic and think that there\nis more that can be done in a specific\narea then that is simply enough!\nHolding a \u2018Campaign Portfolio\u2019\ncomes with some responsibility. You\nmight be expected to help people run\ncampaigns or liaise with certain college\ndepartments or union societies. However, the Representation and Welfare\nBoard is there to support all campaign portfolio holders with\ntime, resources and money\nto support their ideas and\ndevelop a stronger feeling of equality across\nthe campus.\nIf you are interested in\nholding one\nof these\npositions\nthen\nplease\ncontact the\nDeputy President\n(Education and Welfare), email at the top\nof the page, who will\ngive you more information about the\nportfolios. There are lots of exciting\nprojects that you can get involved with\nthis term and throughout the year and\nwe already have an excitable team of\nEqual Opportunities and Welfare Officers at your disposal.\nThe LGBT Campaigns\nportfolio:\nImperial has a thriving community of LGBT student\u2019s and university is recognised as a time\nwhen you are finally free to\nexpress yourself. However, discrimination can still be found on\nour campus and we shouldn\u2019t\nhide from it. Help people to celebrate who they are without being ashamed and take a stand\nagainst homophobic action.\nThe Anti-racism Campaigns\nportfolio:\nGet involved in campaigns\nagainst discrimination on the\nbasis of race, ethnicity and\nfaith. This term will see a week\nlong diversity campaign on\nRISE: Realise Equality, Celebrate Diversity and plenty of\nother events throughout the\nyear. You will have opportunities to liaise with the equality\nand diversity group at Imperial\nCollege, the Overseas Societies\nCommittee and other student\ngroups across Imperial and the\nnational student movement.\nPOSITIONS AVAILABLE\nThe Environmental Campaigns\nportfolio:\nGreen Week is going London\nwide! Get involved with the\nbiggest campaign on our campus and help us make it bigger\nand better. With a radical Environmental Policy in implementation make sure you keep the\nUnion and College on our toes\nand hold us to our promises!\nThe Women\u2019s Campaigns\nportfolio:\nYou can occasionally find women at Imperial! The portfolio is\nhere to help support women,\nspecifically in science, engi-neering, technology and medicine and to raise issues which\nare specifically targeted to\nwomen.\nThe Ethical Campaigns\nportfolio:\nThere are many ethical issues\nrelevant to students. With our\nEthical policy due for an overhaul this is an excellent chance\nto get involved in shaping the\nfuture of the Union in terms of\nethics and wider social respon-sibility. There will be plenty of\nopportunities to get involved in\nFairtrade promotion as we become a Fairtrade University and\nto liaise with Pugwash Society, Fairtrade Society, other like\nminded groups within Imperial\nCollege, the NUS and ULU.\nThe Disabled Students\u2019 Campaigns portfolio:\nImperial College union ran a\n\u2018Don\u2019t hide from Disability Campaign\u2019 two years ago and it is\nnow in need of review. With the\nlibrary refurbishment underway\nand Halls of Residence incorporating new features \u2013 get involved in shaping our campus\nto make it more accessible to\npeople with specific needs.\nHelp us to make sure that nothing is being overlooked and ensure that life is not unnecessarily difficult for any student.\n10 felix Friday 19 October 2007\n\n"

But\nthankfully, they save our great city till\nnear the end so we\u2019ve had a chance to\nsift through the successes of Venice,\nCannes, Toronto, Berlin, etc. and this\nis the result.\nLondon may not have the glamour\nof Cannes and even the biggest Brit\nflick of the year, Atonement, decamped\nto Venice last month, but London differentiates itself from the competition\nin its ability to bring the festival to the\npublic. If you love film, this is the place\nto find it.\nThe events in London this year look\nfantastic and so now is the best time to\nreally explore the biggest range of cinema you\u2019re likely to find in one city. The\nfestival runs from October 17th until\nNovember 1st, so by the time this goes\nto print you\u2019ll be able to rush round\nto Leicester Square and check out the\nfirst releases. And you won\u2019t be alone,\nas the creme de la creme of world cinema descend onto the square.\nThe Gala Screenings this year show\nan impressive line up of Hollywood\ntalent: Halle Berry, Sam Mendes, Tom\nCruise, Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Sienna Miller, Michael Moore,\nBrian De Palma, Colin Firth and Sean\nPenn are all on the bill to launch new\nfilms whilst the likes of David Lynch,\nNaomi Watts and Steve Buscemi all\nhave screen talks of one form or another lined up to entertain the baying\ncrowds.\nBut if you\u2019re reading this then it won\u2019t\nbe the Vanity Fair alumni who you care\nabout, but the films themselves, and\nthe collection seems to showcase a\n\u201cBest Of\u201d from the festivals of the year\nso far. David Cronenberg\u2019s Eastern\nPromises kicked off the opening night\non Wednesday, fresh from winning the\ntop prize at Toronto, the festival most\nnoted for being the first place to exhibit a film you want to win a shed-load\nof Oscars. Ang Lee brings Lust, Caution to our shores, fresh from Venice\nvictory and will be looking to follow\nup the international (inexplicable?) acclaim he received for previous feature,\nBrokeback Mountain. Apparently Lust\nhas more plot to it though, so the signs\nare good. The Cannes champion, Romanian film 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days\nwill also be shown alongside a discussion on Romanian cinema and its recent emergence into the international\nscene.\nBut this is far from just a \u2018cut and\nAs the epicentre of world cinema shifts to Leicester Square for 16 days, why is it that London still captures\nas much interest months after Cannes kicks off the festival season? Because London isn\u2019t capable of boring\npaste\u2019 of more prestigious festivals.\nLondon will have seven world premieres over the 16 days of festival, as\nwell as 128 UK premieres. It has an ex-traodinary wealth of international films\nfrom 43 countries that would normally\nhave great trouble finding distribution\nin the developed world where budget\ntrumps merit. We\u2019ve even already\nseen the first good thing come out of\nthe Madeleine McCann furore as Ben\nAffleck\u2019s new directorial effort, Gone,\nBaby, Gone, has been pulled from the\nschedule due to similarities to reality\nthat I imagine the title of the film will\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nCommunism through the eyes of a child makes Mickey Mouse a fascist\nChildren don\u2019t like change. This is exemplified by Blame It on Fidel, the latest offering showing at the Institute\nof Contemporary Arts which tells the\nstory of Anna (Nina Kervel), a young\ngirl whose parents brutally uproot her\nlife by deciding to become liberals in\nthe 1970\u2019s. Based on a novel by Domitilla Calamai, the film is a bleak foray\ninto a childish mind punctuated with\nbright moments of humour, the camera following Anna\u2019s every movement\nas she is introduced to a totally different way of life.\nAnna, a natural capitalist, puts up\na tough fight against the changes, despite being dragged to marches and\nbombarded with the meetings and\nrows which seem to accompany her\nnew way of life. Nina Kervel\u2019s portrayal\nof Anna was very well rounded, capturing the stubborn childishness of Anna\u2019s\nearlier protests which evolve into more\nthoughtful arguments throughout the\nfilm.\nThere were some good \u2018chuckle out\nloud\u2019 moments, brought about by the\nchildish viewpoint of the treatment\nof Communist militants in Spain and\nFrance in the 1970s. There is also a focus on women\u2019s liberation, with Anna\u2019s\nFran Buckland\nBlame It On Fidel \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Julie Gavras\nWriters: Tony Gilroy\nCast: Julie Depardieu,\nStefano Accorsi,\nNina Kervel\nmother Marie (Julie Depardieu) speaking out about the pro-choice move-ment, which at the time was illegal in\nFrance. These issues, when tinted with\nthe naivety of a child, take on a surreal\nquality which is bought into focus by\nthe overheard rows between Anna\u2019s\nparents over their various political\nstandpoints. Blame It on Fidel manages to capture the political mood of the\nage with surprising accuracy despite its\nyouthful narrator.\nVisually, the film is eye-opening,\nwith the clear contrast of Anna\u2019s old\nand neutral conservative life and new,\ncolourful flat with the walls painted\nred (a rather blatant proof of her parent\u2019s Communist credentials), although I was left wondering whether\nit was totally necessary to have quite\nso many headshots of a frowning and\nthoughtful child. The style of filming\nwas very focussed on the expression of\neach individual and I felt Kervel rose to\nthe challenge of having such unwavering attention. The soundtrack was apt\nand complimented the mood of the\nfilm with long periods of silence interrupted by tinkling piano and strings.\nJust over halfway through the film,\nGavras seemed to get a bit carried away\nand overdid the artistic shots thus losing the pace of the story, although this\ndid help develop Anna\u2019s character to\ndevelop and made her eventual comprehension of the events surrounding\nher far more believable.\n\u201cThese issues,\nwhen tinted with\nthe naivety of a\nchild, take on a\nsurreal quality.\u201d\nIf you like foreign films, artistically\nfocused shots or just a quiet sit in a\ndark corner, then you\u2019ll love Blame It\non Fidel. Overall, the atmosphere of\nthe film was reflective and quite bleak,\nwhich I loved. In short, this coming-of-age story is, despite losing pace around\nthe middle scenes, a good watch, with\nan honest portrayal of a vital part of\nbecoming an adult: accepting change.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just sit here until this whole Communist malarky passes\u201d\nexplain if you haven\u2019t already heard.\nBetter luck next time, Ben.\nIf you\u2019re interested in seeing something that won\u2019t be in your local Odeon\nin a couple of weeks or months, your\nbest bet is to pick up a programme and\nreally dig deep to find the most interesting offerings. Or you could try and\nfind the most sought-after tickets for\nscreen talks but, by now, you\u2019ll have\nto be personal friends with a good PR\ncontact or be Julia Roberts to get a\nplace.\nThe big names do come out in force\nfor London though, and you can catch\nthe \u201crespectable\u201d side of Hollywood\nas well. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck\nride into town in The Assassination of\nJesse James By The Coward Robert Ford\nwhilst Robert Redford directs himself,\nTom Cruise and the ever reliable Meryl Streep in political drama, Lions For\nLambs. Halle Berry is doing her best to\nput her dreadful post-Oscar years behind her, with what appears from the\npreviews to be a very respectable turn\nopposite Benicio del Toro in Things We\nLost In The Fire, Michael Moore will be\ntrying to twist the knife in George Dubya\u2019s side even further with his expos\u00e9\nof the American health service in Sicko\nand just on the other side of the square\nthere will be an eager audience waiting\nto see Cate Blanchett, Christian Bale,\nRichard Gere and various others transform into Bob Dylan for Todd Haynes\u2019s\nI\u2019m Not There.\nNot until the closing-night gala\nscreening of Wes Anderson\u2019s The Darjeeling Limited with Adrien Brody and\nOwen Wilson will cinephiles be able\nto relax and go about their lives again.\nWhether sat in one of the Leicester\nSquare multiplexes, enjoying an event\nat one of the many other cinemas\nacross the city participating in the festival or taking in the free screenings\nslated to happen in Trafalgar Square\n(the last one is Friday 19th, 18:30),\nLondon offers a film festival that strips\naway the elitism of most. It revels in respectability and reputation rather than\nstyle over substance, but don\u2019t think\nthat there\u2019s any lack of style about.\nAnd perhaps that is why Joe Wright\nchose to take Atonement to Venice. It\u2019s\nglorious cinematography can distract\nfrom the slightly muddled chronological issues that resulted from its literary roots, but Venice will accept that.\nLondon is smarter than that. Last year\nthey opened with the best British film\nof the decade, the other James McAvoy\nouting, The Last King of Scotland. Fingers crossed that this year they\u2019ve done\nit again.\n\n"

Although you do need to tell people you\u2019re taking\nthem. The British Library holds a copy of every single book ever published in the United Kingdom, meaning that if you can\u2019t find it anywhere else, it will be on their shelves if it ever touched these shores. You\u2019ll also\nfind extremely well-kept copies of Shakespeare and Chaucer, and many ancient religious texts.\nBest Bit \u2013 It\u2019s a toss-up, but we\u2019d probably opt for the Gutenberg Bible \u2013 one of the first books printed in\nEurope. You can also hunt down the desk where Marx enjoyed to sit and socialise, and the Magna Carta.\nYou won\u2019t find that in Waterstone\u2019s.\nwww.bl.uk\nGosh! Comics, Russell Square\nComics are a funny past-time, in that many of us wonder where it still goes on nowadays, and\nthe rest of us are too busy reading comics to tell them. If you\u2019re completely new to the idea,\nyou could do a lot worse than visit Gosh! Comics, crammed with a huge variety of books from\nall over the world, covering not only the latest releases, but also compilations of older ones, as\nwell as originals of some real classics.\nThe medium has changed a lot since the stereotype days of Marvel and co. You can now find\nphilosophical reflection, religious and political comment, and far more serious storylines,\nalongside the crazier likes of superheroes and adventures.\nThe Best Bit \u2013 The staff at Gosh! are brilliant. Experienced and friendly, they\u2019ll set you up\nwith something whether you\u2019re a first-time reader or you own half of the store already.\nwww.goshlondon.co.uk\nFoyles, Tottenham Court Road\nYou can\u2019t look at London\u2019s unique bookshops without mentioning Foyles, whose history is as\nbizarre and varied as the books they stock. Originally started by two brothers selling their old\nuniversity textbooks (if only it worked so well nowadays) the business was soon booming, selling a huge range of books in a magnificent store in central London (as well as elsewhere).\nFamed for its strange habits such as making customers queue up twice to purchase books\n(once to get a receipt), the store recently changed hands and has since then undergone a massive refit. The old ways are out and the new ways are in \u2013 while that might mean you miss out\non some of the charming oddities, it\u2019s still worth a visit, being as it is a monolith of reading\ngoodness.\nThe Best Bit \u2013 The architecture is strangely alluring. From the outside, it could be mistaken\nfor a glamourous department store. Of course, that\u2019s not too far off.\nwww.foyles.co.uk\nWaterstone\u2019s, Piccadilly\nThe Death Star of book stores, the Waterstone\u2019s in Piccadilly is the largest book shop\nin Europe, meaning that if this towering city of books doesn\u2019t have what you\u2019re looking\nfor, you might need to check that it\u2019s actually been published. The scale of the place is\noverwhelming, and it\u2019s very easy to get lost amongst shelf after shelf of books you\u2019ve\nnever heard of.\nBest Bit \u2013 Saying you\u2019ve been, really. Waterstone\u2019s doesn\u2019t have anything particular\nabout it, but there\u2019s so much of it at Piccadilly that you can\u2019t help but feel impressed.\nTake a good long stroll around, be overwhelmed, and then go and check out our other\nsuggestions!\nwww.waterstones.co.uk\nWritten by Mike Cook, designed by Rosie Grayburn\nNext Week...\nOur initial four-part culture crawl of London\u2019s bustling Zone One is winding to a close, but\nwe\u2019ve got plans to cover other aspects of the City this year.

Often accused of\nbeing \u201ca middle-class interloper\u201d, Keats\nin fact suffered for much of his early\nlife. He lost both parents as well as a\nbrother to tuberculosis and another\nto America. Poverty hindered him in\nfinding true love and in education too.\nKeats carried out his schooling up the\nroad in Enfield and later enrolled at\nGuy\u2019s hospital- a poet and a scientist-to study anatomy, botany, dissection\nand physiology among other things,\nwith the intention to join the Royal\nCollege of Surgeons. However, Keats\ndropped out of medicine to pursue his\ndevotion to poetry. In the last years of\nhis life, he suffered several bouts of illness and depression and was nursed by\nhis fianc\u00e9-to-be Fanny Brawne. Within\none year of their engagement Keats\ndied in Rome 1821.\n\u201cKiss me quick you sexy, iron-clad knight-at-arms!\u201d\nThis week Dr Picasso Jones examines Tom? by Jack E. Cronin\nStudent Art in Focus\nT\nhis week in our little corner of showcasing student\ntalent, we have one sketch\nby the experimental artist Jack E. Cronin. \u2018Tom?\u2019\nis part of an extensive collection of\nsmall sketches.

Although simple\nlooking on the outside, there is\nmore to him than meets the eye.\nLikewise, the allium genus of\nthe Plantae kingdom, which includes such popular vegetables\nas the onion and leek, whilst\ndirty on the outside, conceals below the surface layers of nutritional beauty. Perhaps the artist means\nto imply that he would like to fry\n\u2018Tom\u2019 in butter and make a nice casserole with him, just like one would\nwith an onion. Or make Leek and\nPotato soup.\nThe shape of the head could possibly\nrepresent the humble science student,\nbeing conical flask shaped and thus\neasily filled with knowledge, beer or\nother chemical substances.\nIn the portrait the jaw and\nmouth are very much more prominent than the forehead, which of\ncourse conceals the brain. This is\nrepresentative of a major flaw in human nature, in that we often speak\nbefore we think, for example, having a conversation with a volleyball\nwithout realising its inanimacy. Jack E\nCronin will be selling select pieces of\nthis particular collection at Sotheby\u2019s\nat the end of the month and he expects\nto make at least 12 pence.\nBudding artiste?\nDo you think you could do\nbetter than our featured\nartists?

The destination\nwas Ailefroide, Parc des Ecrins, in the\nFrench Alps.\nTwenty four hours later the team\narrived at the campsite in Ailefroide\nkeen to stretch their legs, so a quick\nforay was made up the Tete de la Draye\n(2077m). We returned to the campsite to share a flagon of red wine with\nclimbers we had met from King\u2019s College. They had already been climbing\nthere for two weeks, so we used the opportunity to get first hand information\nabout the conditions in the area.\nIt was decided that we would trek\nup to the Glacier Blanc and climb the\npeaks surrounding it. The necessary\nfood and fuel for four days was bought\nand packed and everything was nearly ready. For many of the team it was\ntheir first trip climbing the Alps in alpine style, and the skills required for\nsafe glacier travel had to be learnt on\nthe campsite. A couple of hours were\nspent perfecting the art of self rescue\nand assisted rescue from crevasses\n(the fractures found in the surface of\nglaciers). This was a bewildering sight\nfor the other occupants of the campsite but it meant that everyone was\nequipped with the vital skills required\nfor glacier travel.\nIn order to help the team to acclima-tise, a night was spent camping halfway\n(vertically) to the glacier at approximately 2500m before heading onwards\nfrom that camp in the early hours of\nthe morning. It is safer to travel at this\ntime because any snow that melted the\nprevious day will have refrozen over-night, making it much easier and safer\nto walk on.\nThe team made it to base camp\nbright and early and spent the morning preparing the camp and building\na wall of ice blocks as a windbreak \u2013\nnot an easy task at altitude \u2013 and getting ready for the day ahead. The first\nclimb was up the Pic de Neige Cordier\n(3614m), which was non-technical, but\nassisted with acclimatisation. The generally held view is that the best way to\nacclimatise is to climb high but to sleep\nlow so the body can recover. For this\nreason we usually spent the afternoons\nrelaxing in the sun, preparing for the\nnext day, or sleeping.\nAt 2am the following morning we\nmade an attempt on the Pic du Glacier\nBlanc (3525m). This peak was a different style to the first peak, as after reaching the base of the climb over snow, the\nrest was a rock climb. Halfway up the\nroute, after evaluating the risk of con-tinuing, a decision was made to retreat.\nThe team had lost time at the start of\nthe day because we had significantly\nincreased the length of the climb by\nstarting it much lower down the ridge.\nAfter descending to the campsite for\nsome thicker air and more food, the\nweather on the summits turned and so\nwe were forced to stay in the valley for\na few days. To make the most of this\ntime the team spent a few days sport\nclimbing in the valley, and another trying a style of climbing not found (until\nthis year) in the UK.\nVia Ferrata or \u201cthe way of iron\u201d is a\nstyle of climbing where all the protection and holds are fixed to the rock\nface. It was designed to enable soldiers\nto cross mountains quickly and safely\nwith little training during the Second\nWorld War. As the name suggests the\nroute is made of iron staples driven\ndeep into the rock to be used as hand-holds and footholds, as well as a cables\nalongside for protection.\nWhen the weather improved we returned to the glacier and completed the\nfinal alpine climb of the trip, the Dome\nde Neige (4015m), with the intention\nof climbing Barres des Ecrins (4102m)\nfrom there. Unfortunately the weather\ncame in again while we were on the\nsummit of the Dome de Neige, making\nproceeding up to the Barres des Ecrins\nOutdoor club goes outdoors\n\u201cTo put yourself into a situation where a mistake cannot\nnecessarily be recouped, where the life you lose may be your\nown, clears the head wonderfully.\u201d \u2013 Al Alvarez, Mountaineer\nimpossible. Once again the team descended and spent a couple of days\nclimbing on some of the many sport\nclimbing crags around Ailefroide.\nWith \u2018wonderfully clear heads\u2019 the\nteam packed the bus for the long journey home, snuck in a few last climbs,\nand set off for London.\nMembers of the Outdoor Club often\norganise their own trips and expeditions to areas all over the world. This\nyear alone has involved trips to Scotland, Svalbard, Chamonix, Mt Blanc\nand Pakistan amongst others.\nThe Outdoor Club is a great opportunity to have a go at any of these activities and we cater for all abilities, from\nthe complete novice to extreme alpi-nists. We organise trips every fortnight\nduring the term, to North Wales, the\nLake District and other regions of the\nUK. Tours are run at the end of each\nNeil Dowse\nterm. This winter we will be climbing\nsnow and ice in the Cairngorms, at\nEaster we will be scrambling on the Isle\nof Skye, and summer tour next year\nwill be somewhere in the Alps.\nIf you fancy an introduction to climbing closer to home, we climb indoors\nat the Westway Sports Centre every\nWednesday - just come to Beit Quad\nat 1pm. You can meet members of the\nclub at one of these sessions or during\nour regular meetings every Tuesday at\n1230 in dBs.\nMembership is only \u00a314 and all levels of experience are welcome, you can\nlearn all the skills you need for the tour\nlike the one above during the weekend\ntrips.\nFor more information visit www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/rcc/outdoor/ or\nemail outdoor@ic.ac.uk.\nOutdoor club trying the Via Ferrata or \u201cWay of the Iron\u201d style\nSome rock face climbing in the French Alps\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 19 October 2007\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Comment\nComment\nImperial is killing my sense of humour\nI\ndon\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m\nslightly worried that my humour\nis being taken over by sad peculiarities possibly only funny because my degree has taught me\nbetter; Geek-dom is creeping in and\nthere ain\u2019t nothing I can do. In order to\nverify this, I thought I would tell you all\nabout two things which are currently\ncracking me up. You can tell me just\nhow unfunny they truly are and then I\ncan go and cry.\nFirstly fastenings. Yes, fastenings.\nThis is one I truly believe to be intrinsically funny. Take for example\nthe humble pop rivet. It almost does\nit by itself, doesn\u2019t it? Hilarious. Now\nuse your pop rivet to attach two things\nyou might want to attach, preferably\n(of course) things which you can\u2019t pop\nrivet in reality. Anything. Go on. For\nexample, I want to pop rivet this desk\nto my fridge, or this anchovy pizza to\nyour face, or that lecturer to a lamp-post. Ok, Ok, clam down, clam down\n(although off-topic seafood is generally\nalso quite amusing, in fact using fish\npuns just for the halibut (hell of it?\u2026\noh never mind) is nigh-on hysteri-cal). Anyway, I can see you going wild\nwith ideas, but I want to just introduce\nyou to another coma-inducing fasten-ing. The staple. Try the same exercise\nagain. Teaching the dog to stay? Staple.\nNeed an excuse to stay in bed longer?\nStaple. Flat-mate annoying you? Staple.\nNeed I go on?\nSecondly units. Take a sentence involving units and just put the wrong\nones in there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but you\nwere speeding, my meter clearly indicates you are travelling at over 45\ncandela\u201d. My walk to college is approximately 12ml. I have been writing this\narticle for nearly 50Nm. etc. It gets\nme every time to say that the angles\nin a triangle add up to 180 degrees C.\nI mean that\u2019s like 453 Kelvin! One hot\ntriangle. If you just aren\u2019t getting this\nthen try making your own units up.\nMy favourite is the unit of boredom\nwhich we have named after a certain\nlecturer...\nWe all know that Imperial has had\ndire effects on us, but I think actually,\nif we are honest, there is something\ninside us all, some inner person for\nwhich we can\u2019t blame Imperial entirely,\nsomething which the admissions process seems to fall for every time.\nI saw two prime examples in my first\nyear here, both seen in moments of\nweakness: one when the guy was drunk\nand one when he was enjoying himself\ntoo much. Only an Imperial student\nwould try to blame aerodynamics\nwhen playing beer-pong. Only an Imperial student would say \u201ctalk about\nBrownian motion\u201d when referring to\ninflatable balls on a bouncy castle.\nStill, it makes us happy to blame\nthem anyway... stupid Imperial...\nJellybean\nThis week in England... Issue 001\nW\nell, hello there...\nGreetings and welcome to my little\ncorner of Felix. For\nthose not acquainted with powerful entities, I am the\nRingmaster, Bringer of the world and\nKeeper of wisdom \u2013 and despite ru-mours, nobody calls me God in bed. It\nhas recently come to my attention that\nstudents at your prestigious institution\nknow next to nothing about the world\noutside of coursework, alcohol, and\nWorld of Warcraft, and so I am here\nto bring you the facts and nothing but\nthe facts in an enlightening and British\nmedia-esque form.\nI will happily accept all thank-you\ne-mails from newly-learned souls\nthrough our esteemed Felix editor.\nThe Bullshitometer\nPoliticians around England were left\nin shock today as a new invention by\nRingmaster Technologies Limited has\nfinally brought a \u201cBullshitometer\u201d into\nbeing, soon to be sold to such agencies as MI5 and America\u2019s infamous\nCIA for the purposes of questioning\nsuspected terrorists. Doctors, lawyers,\nnurses\nnurses, teachers and kebab shop owners across the country are likely to be\ndetained in the not-too-distant future.\nIn other news, unemployed dodgy\nlooking blokes in baseball caps with\nwires sticking out of their backpacks\nappear to be exempt from screening as\nlong as they stay on public transport,\nor if they aren\u2019t Brazilian.\nCrime and Missing Children\nDespite the ground-breaking trial\nscheme currently in force since the\nthird of May, which was entirely effective at surpressing criminal activity\nthroughout the entire country, ministers in Portugal have hinted today\nexclusively to Felix that the decree recently passed banning all crime is to be\nlifted shortly.\n\u201cDespite the huge success of the\nscheme and that there is clearly no\ncrime in Portugal, the National Police\nvalue diversity in training activities,\nespecially for young recruits who must\nbuild up the experience and confidence\nto further themselves as officers,\u201d\nMarco de Pollo, minister of Nando\u2019s,\nwas quoted as saying. \u201cWe will soon\nbe abolishing the scheme in favour of\nre-allowing crime in the nation of Portugal on a limited basis\u201d. In the western European country, the media have\nbeen searching but been unable to report on a single instance of crime since\nthe 4th of May.\nIt is also rumoured that this is to coincide with a lift on a hard-line media\npolicy in England that only one child is\nallowed to be missing at any one time.\nAnd In Sport...\nEngland have proudly destroyed\nthe French with another astounding\ndisplay by the team that gloriously won\nthe 2003 World Cup, crushing the sorry\nFrogs in the process... hold up, England\ninched out France with a good show\nby Jonny Wilkinson, who also kicked\nthe winning points in the 2003 World\nCup final... actually, Jonny Wilkinson\nkicked his way to an England-scraper\nagainst bitter rivals France, who have\ndrubbed England in previous meet-ings...well, Wilkinson singlehandedly\nplayed good football to once again beat\nrugby, in a game that proves we have\nno bloody hope of winning the Cup\nagain unless South Africa also opt to\nplay with only one player (oops \u2013 they\nhave Montgomery)!\nOh, and please forget about what\nhappened in the Cricket World Cup,\nbecause we managed to beat Sri Lanka.\nOnce.\nThe\nRingmaster\nLessons learnt from the weather\nO\nver the past few years,\na motley assortment of\nAmericans have swept\nacross the Atlantic and\nforced their way into\nour homes. Misanthropic-but-strangely-loveable doctors, unflappable Los\nAngeles police officers, brilliant-yet-overly-sexed East Coast lawyers and\nhopeless castaways are now to be found\nin almost every European lounge.\nAs entertaining as Dr. House and his\nprime-time colleagues may be, they\nare hardly the most refined nor the\nmost uplifting visitors we could hope\nto welcome.\nIt is certainly understandable with\nsuch a wide and varied choice, for one\nto switch viewing loyalties on an almost weekly basis. Nevertheless, I prefer to reserve the one-room apartment\nin the small black box in my own home\nto one regular and trusted visitor. For I\nwatch the same show today that I have\nwatched for years; the BBC Weather\nForecast.\nIndeed, I am a very regular viewer \u2013\na characteristic I obviously share with\na large proportion of the British public,\nas the Forecast has recently begun its\n58th season, and there is no sign of it\nbeing discontinued in the near future.\nWhat really draws me to it however,\nother than its marvellously original\nand flowing plotline, is its ability to\ndelve into almost any given genre with\na rare facility.\nWho can forget the great heights\nof human drama reached during the\nreports of the Great Storm of 1987?\nI regrettably missed those specific\nepisodes, but the reruns, though very\ntricky to get hold of, are certainly\nworth it. Those particular broadcasts\nare especially memorable in the controversy that they stirred up. I urge\nall my readers to learn for themselves\nhow Michael Fish\u2019s report has been\noutrageously misquoted, and to really\nimmerse themselves in the passionate\ndebate that surrounded that notorious\nand divisive season.\nI would hate for you to have the misconception that the Forecast is merely\na heavy, dramatic show with too much\nexcitement for the average viewer. Rest\nassured, that could not be further from\nthe truth.\nAlthough the show has never been\npassed off as a comedy, the fast-paced\nrepartee and international setting provide ample opportunities for merriment and mirth.\nWhat really sets it apart from the\nother shows on television today how-ever, is the accuracy with which it\nhighlights the human condition. All\nthe poignancy of our sorry existence\ncan be reflected in the speed with\nwhich a 32-degree-high announced\nfor the coming Sunday can transform\ninto a snow-filled weekend. The series\nserves, above all, as a lesson; we can\nnever be certain about what the future\nholds \u2013 all we can do is laugh at what\u2019s\nhappening today. And so I welcome\nour American gatecrashers, for though\nthey may be inappropriately dressed,\nthey are certainly entering into the\nspirit of the party.\nGilead Amit\nMike Fish in 1987\nFootball Rugby star, Johnny Wilkinson\n\n"

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 19 October 2007 felix\nGames\nGairalgo Episode 2 \u2013 SMT: Persona 3\nAzfarul Islam\nI\u2019ve probably broken some sort of xenophobic or atleast esoterism boundary\nhere with Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 which just so happens to be this\nweek\u2019s musing for Gairalgo.\nWhile not reinventing the wheel in\nany particular way, Persona 3 is an impressively creative title whose holistic\napproach in melding awkward styles\ndemands respect. It\u2019s an oxymoron in\nthat it gladly deviates from the strictly\nlinear structure of the quintessential\nJ-RPG yet is firmly entrenched with\nstrong Japanese idiosyncrasies at all\nlevels of design. In many ways, it\u2019s the\ntruest playable form of a complicated\nalbeit entertaining anime series.\nThe titular personas form the crux\nof rather ensnaring, macabre tale of a\n25th hour out of time, one where daemons roam free. It\u2019s only by channelling your own psyche into a physical,\ncombatant manifestation are you able\nto stay these denizens. Besides the addicting Pok\u00e9monesque management of\nthese personas (who can be levelled\nup and fused), the battles are standard\nfare with some nice little touches that\nenhance the pacing. The other half of\nthe gameplay is the most unusual: the\nschool simulation, if you will. Your daytime activities cleverly mimic those of\na student sans the harsher sides. You\ncan choose to join sporting societies,\nplay videogames, hang out with certain\ncliques, watch films, et al. Whether you\nactually decide to study for a test as\nopposed to saving the world inevitably\ndepends on what you yourself think is\nthe right decision as opposed what you\nthink is best for the game; it\u2019s deceptively postmodern and quite remarkable in hindsight.\nHere, all your interactions and activities manifest in the form of Social\nLinks that ebb and flow with the ways\nyou deal with them. These bestow\nmany unique bonuses to your persona,\noft allowing them to realise greater\nand unusual abilities. This fascinating\nconnection between your night-time\ntrysts with the Shadows within the\nDark Hour and your current social\nstatus stands as a cogent argument for\ngiving careful thought to crafting yourself a true persona (pun intended).\nOf course, all this is interesting\nmostly if you\u2019re into the sort of thing:\nthe game is so strongly and stylistically\nabstruse that the supreme majority of\nyou will be alienated at the word Shin.\nFor those willing to brave it, there\u2019s\nsomething special to be found here.\nPersona 3 is not currently\navailable in the UK. Import it as\nyou see fit. Alternatively, wait.\nYeah, go ahead and shoot yourself, emo kid\nFlamebait: Total SnoreBoreChore\nMichael Cook is sending you all into no-man\u2019s land. Tabletop strategists first. Mind the gap\nO\nh boy. I bet you played\nthe Total War series,\nright? Right? I bet you\nthought it was per-ret-ty fun. All those little\nmen, moving around on <insert period\ntransport here> and clashing <insert\nperiod-appropriate weapon here> on\nthe <period terrain>. Gripping stuff.\nLike Ben Hur, but with the frame rate\nturned way down, directed by Al Gore\nand shot from fifteen hundred feet\naway.\nLook, I like strategy games, okay? I\nlike them because I get to think and\nthen act. Think. Then act. The action\ncomes after the thinking, which Total\nWar manages to get from its first iteration \u2013 the Japanoriffic Shogun: Total\nWar \u2013 but what it fails to grasp is that\nwhen I ask for things to happen, I expect to still be alive when they occur. I\ndon\u2019t expect to have to raise an heir on\nthis side of the monitor in order to take\nthe game on when I die of old age waiting for my cavalry to get into a flanking\nposition.\nHow many strategies do I need ex-actly? Even Sun Tzu would think it\nwas going a little over the top \u2013 there\u2019s\nonly two ways to go through a valley,\nthe right way and the wrong way. The\nwrong way gets everyone killed, and\non that basis 90% of Total War strategies are \u2018the wrong way\u2019. And no, I don\u2019t\naccept that I\u2019m merely rubbish at the\ngame, as I was raised by hardened vet-erans, and most multiplayer training\nsessions involved swearing over Teamspeak and the AI laying the smack\ndown on just about everyone in sight.\nOf course, maybe that\u2019s the beauty.\nMaybe that elusive 10% is what the\ngame is all about, the meaty strategy\nhiding away in the massive pile of gris-tle, teeth-gnashing and completely unnecessary historical pomposity. Maybe\nit\u2019s significant that there are four different kind of pikemen. Maybe I need\nto understand the tactical nuances of\nmen on elephants and not just accept\nthat, hey, they\u2019re walking grey brick\nshithouses.\nBecause that\u2019s what gets me most\nabout Total War \u2013 the entire idea, from\nstart to finish, is fun-sounding. Command huge armies! Fire flaming pigs at\ncities! Starve people! Fling people! Elephant people! The game series invents\nthe verb to elephant for god\u2019s sake. And\nyet, despite all of this, it\u2019s really, really\nnot very fun at all.\nIt\u2019s got fucking elephants. How can it\nnot be fun?\nMiraculously, it manages it. It manages it through a clever combination\nof statistics, randomness and horrible,\ncrippling slowness. Even with a speed\ncontrol, this game moves on at a snail\u2019s\npace. Cavalry units sweep majestically across massive tracts of grassy-browny-grass and then collide for five\nseconds with a group of another col-our. Random numbers are generated.\nYou lose.\nYeah, alright, I forgot that South Roman Purple Spearmen get a 19% pre-tax bonus against Men On Horses\nWith Hats On. And yes, I foolishly\nbought the Level 3 Hats upgrade which\nadds go-faster stripes to the horses but\nalso makse them weak versus water\nPok\u00e9mon. Yes. There were bad tactical\ndecisions made. But with an infinite\namount of them to make, it\u2019s quite hard\nto make the better ones.\nIt\u2019s that awful combination of slow\nbuild-up and very fast failure that not\nonly makes it a polar opposite to the\ndizzying quality heights of Team Fortress 2 and Command And Conquer,\nbut also trips up on so many Bad Design Rules that it\u2019s a wonder any of you\never played it at all. You do realise that\ngames are supposed to be fun?\nFun? Yes?\nThat means that when elephants are\ntold to attack something they trumpet\nMy followers prepare the welcome wagon for Suffragette : Total War\u2019s PR department announcement\nAs Benjamin\u2019s tie began to gorge on his genitalia, his only solace was\nthat he\u2019d never have to play another game of Total War ever again\nthe theme tune from The A-Team and\nthrow men around as they shout racial\nslurs and dismember themselves. And\nwhen I tell troops to siege a city they\nput up banners with catchy insulting\nslogans and amusing political car-toons. And maybe ferrets. I don\u2019t know,\nsomething FUN. Not horrific historical\naccuracy to the point of HORRIBLE,\nHORRIBLE BOREDOM.\nGUYS... history is boring. It\u2019s taught\nby people with goatees and using\ntextbooks that have their own postal\ncodes. It doesn\u2019t need a game conver-sion, guys. It doesn\u2019t need four of them,\nthat\u2019s for damn sure.\nNow get back to tank rushes and\nshotguns, and if I see a single elephant\nin a game that isn\u2019t wearing a cape, I\u2019m\ngetting out the trebuchets and laying\nsiege to Creative Assembly.\n\u2018round we go\nAzfarul Islam\n\u201cEscape the Room\u201d puzzles can be\nrather unweildy beasts. Sometimes\nthey\u2019re so darn erudite that it takes a\nderanged mind to solve them.

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 19 October 2007 felix\nComment\nComment\nA letter from a physicist\nK\nudos to Sir Richard Sykes\nfor saying what needs to\nbe said. If there is one\nthing that mother-state\ngovernments have lost, it\nis a pragmatic connection with real-ity. Fuelled by a desire to sit in the hallowed halls of Parliament, their front of\nan idealistic crusade to make the world\nperfect has done well to rob the populace of this connection as well. It\u2019s high\ntime that everyone got realistic about\na few things.\nFor a complex collection of reasons,\nthe University experience has been\nquite indefensibly hoisted upon a grandiose pedestal in the eyes of too many\npeople. Like a revered monastery of\nspiritual pursuit, one would think that\nhere and here alone can one embark\nupon a path of self-exploration and\nthe cultivation of greatness. Nothing\ncould be further from the truth. It is\nargued that the benefits of scholarly\nknowledge should be available to all, a\nposition I would fervently support. But\nit all breaks down when the assumption is made that a University is the\nonly place one can access these fruits\nof academia.\nI am not an astronomer, I am an\nengineer and materials scientist. The\nonly stellar body my work requires\nme to understand is our sun \u2013 spe-cifically, the quantity and nature of\nenergy it provides us. But does this\nmundane and minimal engagement of\nthe cosmos, as it relates to my scholarly pursuit, leave me floundering in\nignorance of the magnificence of our\nuniverse? Of course not. But while astronomy holds great interest for me,\nI don\u2019t feel the need to explore it to a\nlevel of professional competence. In\nfact, I need not do so to appreciate the\nwealth of information that professional\nastronomers have given to the world.\nJust the same can be said of an interest\nin economics, psychology, or philoso-phy. The works of Voltaire, Friedman,\nand Freud are available in any library\nor bookstore for the world to indulge\nthemselves in. Why it should require\ntens of thousands of pounds of taxpayer money (or, rather, inflation tax,\nI should say) to motivate young people\nto pursue their interests is beyond rational comprehension.\nAnd thus we get to the point; namely,\nwhat the purpose of a University education actually ought to be. For most\nstudents, it seems that Sir Richard is\nexactly correct in calling it \u201ca nice four\nyears off\u201d. Four years of expending\ngreat effort to master a discipline they\nhave little, if any, intention of pursuing\nat any level which justifies the effort of\nmastering it so. Four years of accumulating debt and four years of expending effort which could be better spent\ncultivating expertise in a field which\nactually would benefit them in the job\nmarket. I would be considered a fool if\nI spent four years mastering the trade\nof cutting-edge tooling and machining,\naccumulating great financial debt, only\nto pursue a career in family counsel-ling, so why is it considered acceptable,\neven heavily encouraged, to do the op-posite? I would offer as conjecture that\none egregious stereotype is responsi-ble, and that is that those who attend\nUniversity are \u201csmart\u201d and those who\ndon\u2019t are not. Balderdash! We\u2019re just\nexperts at different things (I know\nplenty of academics who couldn\u2019t lay\nflooring if their life depended on it!).\nWhat\u2019s worse is that the world of\nemployers seems to have bought this\nmyth as well, and have structured their\nfinancial compensations likewise \u2013 or\nat least they did for a time. Anyone\nwho has looked at the job market re-cently, however, will come to the conclusion that a University degree isn\u2019t\nworth what it used to be. Employers\nhave come to quickly realise that it is\nexperience which is by far preferable\nin an employee, and pushing kids into\na University degree which they\u2019ll have\nno use for puts them in double jeopardy in this respect. Not only do they\ngain a burdensome debt, but they\nlose four years of useful, employable,\nexperience.\nThe saturation of undergraduate programmes with half-serious students \u2013\nthose who know from the get-go that\nthey\u2019ll have no use for their degree\n\u2013 compounds the problem further.\nThose who are serious are held behind\nwith pressure to ensure the success of\nall students, and those graduating are\nentering the job market with a flood\nof other candidates who, in failing to\nmaximise the opportunities they had\nat University, lower the expected value\nof a new graduand to employers. It\u2019s\na lose-lose situation and government\nmeddling is at the root of it. Cutting\nsubsidies to higher education would\nmake students think twice before taking on the very serious commitment of\nspecialising in an academic discipline.\nAs Milton Friedman once said : \u201cWe\nare always more responsible when we\nspend our own money than when we\nspend someone else\u2019s.\u201d Anyone genuinely seeking a career in academia or\nacademically demanding profession\nshould have no reason to fear a student\ndebt.\nSo, here\u2019s a radical idea: do away\nwith economically crippling minimum\nwage laws for young people and allow\nbusinesses to employ them directly\nfrom secondary school at lower wages\n\u2013 bring back the tried-and-tested apprenticeship but keep the government\nout of it. A seventeen year-old entering the job market may not have the\nskills or productive capacity to justify\nthe current minimum-wage, particularly in a skilled-work job, and since\nemployers are not generally engaged\nin the business of charity, this provides a strong disincentive to employing them. An apprenticeship system,\nhowever, would allow young people to\nactually make money while learning,\nrather than accumulating debt, and to\nleave that apprenticeship period with\nreal skills of actual, employable value.\nDisentangling employers from the bureaucracy of contracts and reporting\ninvolved in the current apprenticeship\nschemes would allow them the freedom to discover the natural talents of\ntheir young employees and direct their\nlearning in an area of the business to\nwhich they are best suited.\nWithout the burden of a University\nhomework load, they would also have\nample free time to explore any academic interests they fancied, and without\nthe stress of needing to make grades\nor the burden of being required to immerse themselves into the topic at an\nadvanced and technical level. \u201cA Brief\nHistory of Time\u201d can teach most people more than they ever need to know\nabout physics and \u201cThe Selfish Gene\u201d\nI\nwish to respond to the comment made by our Union\nPresident last week. He said:\n\u201cOur current policy in favour of\nfree education funded entirely\nby the taxpayer is unrealistic. Imperial\nCollege Union revokes all previous\npolicy on higher education fund-ing, pending a consultation with the\nstudent body.\u201d\nThere are two points to address here:\nfirstly, whether free education is actually unrealistic. Secondly, even if this\nwere the case, our Union has a responsibility to protect its student members\nagainst the marketisation of our educa-tion. If a students\u2019 union is not going to\ndefend the interests of students, then\nwho will?\nIf the President believes that the\nonly way to fund Higher Education is\nthrough increased top-up fees, we are\nbasically giving people such as Sir Richard Sykes a free pass to increase top-up fees from \u00a33000 to \u00a35000 in 2009\nas he would like to \u2013 and he wouldn\u2019t\nstop there as he has made very clear in\nthe past.\nThe President seems to have reached\nthis conclusion through various conferences held during the summer, including the NUS Campaigns Convention.\nAn important point to note is that the\nNUS considered many ways in which\nthe costs of education could be met by\ntaxpayers, and did not reach a definite\nconclusion \u2013 so I do not believe that\nour President can so confidently state\nthat free education is unrealistic.\nThe reason for thinking that free\neducation is unrealistic is perhaps influenced by the opinion of the govern-ment. However, things the government\nthinks are unrealistic are not necessarily so. For them, a blank cheque is written when money is needed for war or\nweapons of mass destruction but not\nfor education.\nThere are plenty of ways to fund\nHigher Education that do not involve\nincreasing the tax burden on ordinary\ncitizens. For example, the renewal of\nTrident, the UK\u2019s nuclear deterrent, is\ngoing to cost the taxpayer between \u00a313\nbillion and \u00a325 billion. Instead of maintaining a stockpile of nuclear weapons\nthat can never be ethically used and do\nnot make us more secure, we could use\nthis money to abolish tuition fees.\nThe President is tapping into a general feeling of apathy and disempow-erment \u2013 we can\u2019t do anything about\nit so there\u2019s no point trying. But the\nprimary duty of our Union is to represent students \u2013 and if both our Union\nand the College are for increased top-up fees then we, as students, will have\nabsolutely no representation. It is the\nduty of our Union to take a principled\nstand on the issue of top-up fees.\nHaving read the previous Union\nTop-Up Fees Policy I can see no reason for revoking it. The points passed\nby Council a year ago are just as valid\ntoday, for example: \u201cTop-up fees have\ncreated a market in Higher Education which hinders the involvement of\nthose students who come from backgrounds with historically low participation rates.\u201d\nAlso, notably, the Union believed\nthat \u201cany \u2018review\u2019 by the Government is\nlikely to be a sham, designed to smooth\nthe passage of unrestricted top-up\nfees.\u201d I would suggest that any review\nof this policy by our Union would itself\nbe a sham.\nI would also like to ask whether this\ndecision is being influenced by the\nCollege at all. The handover of the Union\u2019s finances to the College\u2019s finance\ndivision over the summer, followed\nby a decision in Council to revoke all\npolicy on Higher Education funding\nraises questions in my mind, especially\nwhen the College\u2019s stance towards top-up fees is considered. The fact that the\nUnion President\u2019s comment comes at\nthe same time as the Rector calling for\nincreased top-up fees and increased\ninterest on student loans is indicative\nof a students\u2019 union that is not entirely\nindependent.\nI would like to suggest that a decision of this magnitude, revoking all\nprevious policy on Higher Education\nfunding, should be decided by a refer-endum, and propose this as a course\nof action for further decisions on this\nmatter. The Higher Education Policy\nof our Union should be decided by its\nstudents.\nCaroline Clark\nPugwash Chair\nA letter from the Pugwash society\ndoes a great job with biology and genetics \u2013 these aren\u2019t topics which most\npeople need to delve into any deeper\nthan that, but which remain accessible\nto those who do not require functional\nexpertise.\nAttitudes must change. We need to\nstart showing more collective appreciation for the challenging and manifestly essential work done by non-ac-ademics in the running of the society\nwe all enjoy. Only when non-academic\npursuits gain the respect they deserve\nwill young people (and their parents)\nfeel confident in pursuing them without a nagging sense of having somehow debased themselves by following\na career path which truly engages their\ntalents and not merely the interest of\ntheir pocketbooks. And so long as governments feel the need to flood us with\ndistorted propaganda, disingenuously\nand counter-productively inflating the\nvirtues of higher education and para-lysing socialist policy, this simply can\u2019t\nhappen.\nJustin Dane (Research Assistant)\nPhysics Department\nA Trident missile: a waste of\nmoney that instead could be used\nto pay for higher education?\nAfter graduation day, will it all have been a waste of time for you?

Brunel\npounced on this opening and scored a\npenalty and a try in the first half, leaving the score 10 - 0 at half time to\nBrunel.\nImperial were not ready to give up,\nespecially when it was clear that the\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nforwards were capable of disrupting\nscrums and even stealing line-outs. It\nwas Brunel that were starting to lose\ntheir temper in this half, with the fly-half hitting Joe Brown with a late tackle\nthat led to a sin-bin. With Brunel down\nto 14 men, the forwards increased the\npressure from the line-out with rolling mauls, scoring two tries, one from\nAlex Johnstone and the other from\nJovan Nedic. With the sin-bin coming\nback on, the Brunel prop then decided\nto punch both the prop and the second\nrow, before finally being sent off. This\nonly fired up Brunel who then scored\na try that eventually won them the\ngame.\nAlthough a loss, the side can take a\nlot of positives to the next game. Man\nof the Match went to Ed Labinski for\nhis hard work in the line-outs, and Twat\nof the Match went to Kieran Burge for\ngetting so wound up that the referee\ntold the captain to calm him down.\nRugby\nBrunel Men\u2019s 1st XV 15\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV 10\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nOK, so there have been two rugby reports in two weeks, and yes I do play\nfor the 1st XV so they\u2019re always going to get a report in mainly because\nI write them. But please don\u2019t start\nthinking that I\u2019ll ignore all the other\nteams that exist out there, I do want to\nget as much sports coverage as possible in Felix. Whether it is a match report from the previous week\u2019s fixtures,\nor even if they\u2019re from the weekend or\nMonday nights, they will all have room\nin the sports section.\nThere have been a lot of fixtures in\nthe last two weeks, and most of them\nwinning fixtures, so why not write\nabout them? Why not let the whole\ncollege, or just the other sports teams,\nknow how well your side did at their\nlast game? For example, on Saturday\nthe 4th XI and the 5th XI football teams\nplayed each other in the University of\nLondon Union (ULU) league, a match\nthat the 5ths won (see fixtures and\nresults section for a full list of results\nfrom the previous week). And next\nweekend, the 6th XI will play the 7th\nXI football team as will the 1st and 2nd\nXI in their respective ULU leagues.\nSimilarly, there have been some extraordinary results this week; results\nthat I for one would be very interested\nin finding out how they happened. The\nladies rugby teams beat Writtle 50 - 5\nin their opening match of the season,\nand the netball girls beat Greenwich 63\n- 19 ... 63 goals in 60 minutes ... a net\na minute, a great achievement! So lets\nhear about it girls! Then we have the\nteams that are hardly heard of because,\nlets face it, the majority of reports in\nthe past have been from rugby, football and hockey, and I really want to\nencompass all the teams that exist out\nthere. So please don\u2019t feel like I won\u2019t\nput your reports in!\nFor those of you who want to get\nahead of the game and publish their\nreports from the Wednesday games,\nthen this is what I would like you to do.\nCould you all please let me know on the\nMonday if you definitely intend to send\na match report in on Wednesday, and\nwether or not you will have a picture\nwith it. A decent sized report would\nbe about 400 words long. If the reports\ncould then be sent to the sports email\n(sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk) as soon as\npossible on the Wednesday, I will try\nmy best to get them into the paper.\nHopefully we\u2019ll have more of a variety with match reports next week for\nall of you to read, as well as more interesting reports from the summer and\ncompetitions.\n\n"

Not to mention some of the best diving sites,\nand a capital city dotted with mosques, markets and absolute madness amongst all its magnificence...\nNadine Richards\nTravel Editor\nMadness. As I have mentioned before\nand will mention again, because it is so\nabsolutely fitting for a country where\nyou try and pay to use the Internet\nand instead end up being given sweets.\nThis is typical of the Egyptian people,\nwhom I found to be the friendliest and\nmost generous I\u2019ve ever encountered.\nSo how did it all begin?\nFacing the 40-plus degree heat, we\ndecided to head for the town centre the\ncheap, local way \u2013 by bus. Not quite as\neasy as imagined. By the time we\u2019d deciphered the number of each bus from\nArabic, we found that it had already\nrolled past us. We weren\u2019t quite as\nadept as the locals at sprinting after the\nbus down the street, then getting \u201con\u201d\nto it, which appeared to involve half the\npassengers standing outside of it, clinging onto the roof and standing on one\nof the tyres as the bus veered down the\nroad at breakneck speed. Never mind,\njust accept that we\u2019re tourists and take\na cab. After haggling, we eventually\nhit lucky with a taxi driver high on\u2026\nhappiness? \u201cHow much?\u201d we ask, as he\nreplies \u201cWhatever you want, whatever\nyou want!\u201d Well alright then\u2026 \u201cHow\nabout 27 Egyptian?\u201d \u201cOk, ok, whatever\nyou want\u201d. Yes, ok. We want.\nOr did want, until I discovered that\ndriving laws do not exist in Cairo \u2013 apparently the main theory behind the\ndriving test is that the roads of Cairo\nare a Formula One racing ground; the\nonly rule is that you honk your horn as\nloudly as you can and the prize is that\nyou damage your car in the most spectacular way possible, preferably without dying.\nCairo is overwhelming. It is absolutely beautiful and totally breathtaking. In\nArabic, Cairo means \u201cThe Vanquisher\u201d\nor \u201cThe Triumphant\u201d, and even to this\nday, it is difficult to imagine another\ncity that it cannot vanquish with its\nmagnificence. If a city\u2019s greatness can\nbe measured by how much it appeals\nto one\u2019s senses, then Cairo is certainly\none of the greatest. My first night of\nthe city is unforgettable: As we wander round at midnight, the people have\npoured out of their houses and onto the\nstreets, which are as busy and bustling\n(and as difficult to manage) as Oxford\nStreet during the New Year\u2019s sales. We\npass by the market stalls where the locals do their shopping and are greeted\nby the sights of herbs and spices beyond any range I ever knew existed,\nand an assortment of clothes, shoes,\ntools, and every electronic device pos-sible. The air is an odd mixture of car\nfumes from the road and aromatic flavours from the street. People who are\nnot too busy haggling shout at us as we\nwalk by; \u201cJapanese! Konichiwa!\u201d\u2013 due\nto our (sort of) Oriental looks. And\nwedged in between all this chaos lies\nthe shisha cafes, where old men can\ncatch their breath to watch this hectic\ncity-life idly go by. We finish our day\nat the more famous, tourist-orientated\nmarket of Khan-el-Khalili, a haven for\nsouvenir shopping and where being\nripped off is the norm \u2013 having said\nthat, being ripped off in Egypt will still\nland you a meal for \u00a31.\nOf course, it is impossible to talk\nabout Egypt without mentioning the\nPyramids of Giza. However, I will only\nmention them and say that this is one\nplace you must visit in your lifetime.\nWords cannot justify how it feels to\nsee one of the symbols of the ancient\nworld, it is suffice to say that there is\nnothing anti-climactic about it. As I\nsat on the lower steps of the Pyramid\nof Khufu and leant my back against it,\nthe Egyptian man next to me pointed\nto his spliff and offered me \u2018Hashish?\nHashish?\u2019 Accepting would have resulted in an experience too surreal for\nme to handle.\nCairo has no end of tourist attractions to see. It is divided into two main\ncultural areas: Islamic Cairo and Old\nCairo. Islamic Cairo is overlooked by\nthe majestic Cairo Citadel, and was\none of the former centres of the Islamic world. This is of little surprise\nconsidering that the district offers\nover one hundred and fifty mosques,\nas well as madrasas, hammams, and\nfountains for the sightseer. Similarly,\nOld Cairo offers Roman ruins amongst\nancient churches. In addition, there is\nthe Egyptian Museum with Tutankhamun\u2019s treasures, and an endless array\nof remaining antiques which have not\nyet been stolen by the British Museum,\nand, need I say, mummies? Apparently looking at every artefact within\nthe museum for one minute would\nland you with a nine-month stay. All\nI can say is that one afternoon in the\nmuseum landed me with very sore feet\nand eyes. Not that I didn\u2019t appreciate\nit \u2013 the mummified cats are a cute\nhighlight.\nMoving further south is the city\nof Luxor; once known as the capital\nThebes in the time of the New Kingdom of Egypt. It is home to the Valley\nof the Kings, which is now most famous for the discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb. Sadly, the tomb itself is\nmostly stripped bare, with all of the\nartefacts having been moved to the\nEgyptian Museum but fantastic colourful hieroglyphics and atmospherically illuminated corridors descending\nto the Tombs of Horemheb and Ramesses VI more than make up for this\ndisappointment.\nNext is a brief stop to Aswan, for the\nsole purpose of visiting the awe-inspir-ing temple, Abu Simbel. The temple\nis a 3 hour drive from Aswan and the\nheat during the day makes it difficult to\nappreciate it in all its splendour unless\nseen in the early hours. Make that the\nvery early hours. We wake up at 3am to\njoin a coach of noisy, jolly, Australian\ntourists (Why are they always happy?\nWhy are there so many Australians\neverywhere?

    "content": "33\nFriday 19 October 2007 felix\nBo\u2019s bumpy journey south\nBo\u2019s bumpy journey south\nE\nvery year, on the first Sunday in November, nearly\n500 cars built before 1905\nare driven from Hyde Park\nCorner to Madeira Drive in\nBrighton, a journey of 60 miles. This\nis the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, which takes place every\nyear to commemorate the 1896 \u2018Emancipation Run\u2019, when cars no longer had\nto have a man carrying a red flag walking in front. Last year, as usual, C&G\nMotor Club\u2019s 1902 James and Browne\nBoanerges (or Bo\u2019 for short) was en-tered, driven by Simon Hamlin.\nEarly in the morning of Sunday 5th\nNovember 2006, we made the final\nchecks before setting off. Equipment: 1\ntoolbox of random crap for any roadside repairs; 1 socket set for similar;\n1 CGCU President, Mr. James Fok, to\nslow us down and get in the way. That\ndone, we set off for Hyde Park, with\nHenry Weaver co-driving.\n\u201cElectric cars\nare nothing new\nhaving been\naround longer\nthan petrol-driven ones\u201d\nThe cars all line up on the bridleway\nthat runs along the North side of the\nSerpentine. Here, we met a guy who\ndrove Bo\u2019 back in the 1960s, and remembered when Col. Browne, one of\nBo\u2019s builders, used to come and see\nthem on the run. Then at 07.33 (not\na minute later!) we drove through the\nstart line and towards Marble Arch.\nHowever, we had not gone more a\nhundred yards before the driver\u2019s side\nheadlamp swung open, and we had to\nstop to shut it. Why was it still wob-bling? We\u2019d deliberately glued up the\nscrews to stop it doing that. This would\nlater come back to haunt us\u2026\nAttempt 2: leaving Hyde Park, past\nMarble Arch, and down towards Buckingham Palace, we noticed an alarming\nnumber of participants had already\nstopped at the roadside; were we really\nexpecting to succeed in travelling 60\nmiles in a centenarian car?\nSince the days of the original run,\nCroydon town centre has been pedes-trianised. However, the town Council\nfenced off a route through the town,\nand all the cars drove down this narrow channel, weaving past trees, litter\nbins, crossing the tram tracks, and out\nthe other side. As we turned into Purley\nWay, we saw a cloud of thick smoke up\nahead; was one of the cars in trouble?\nAs we got closer, we saw that it was the\n1896 Salvesen steam carriage: a vehicle\nthat looks not unlike an old-fashioned\nhorse cart, with the driver sitting right\nup front and a vertical boiler at the\nback, into which the fireman was furiously shovelling coal.\nShortly after this, we spotted our\nsupport crew hiding in a bus stop, so we\npulled in to change co-driver, to David\nHankin. The next part of the run was relatively straightforward, as we left London and headed South. At times, I had to\nshade my eyes from the sun; some of the\nspectators who line the route thought\nI was saluting and saluted back! As we\nentered Redhill we recived a phonecall\nfrom the team, telling us they were waiting for us at a petrol station. We watched\nout for it. We passed it. Realising our\nmistake, we pulled in at the next petrol\nstation (well, we got it half right) and informed the others where we were. They\nwere already on their way. Swapping co-drivers to Dave Horton, we set off again.\nThe Halfway point on the run is at\nCrawley, where the town centre is closed\noff for all the drivers to stop for a coffee break! We were greeted by the great-grandson of Francis Leigh Martineau,\nBo\u2019s designer. One of the ex-Bo\u2019 drivers,\nwho was following us to Brighton by\nbike, arrived and started the engine for\nus. The cars on the Brighton run all date\nfrom before the advent of starter-motors\n(although some heretics have retro-fit-ted them), so they have to be started by\nstarting-handle. Bo\u2019s engine is mounted\ntransversely and so has to be started\nfrom the side of the car, thus eliminating the risk of being run over by your\nown car!\nAs we left Crawley we passed one\nof the few electric cars to take part in\nthe run. Electric cars are nothing new,\nhaving been around longer than petrol\ndriven cars.\nOur next stop was at the infamous\nPeas Pottage service station, where\nwe picked up Matt Harris, the co-driver for the final section into\nBrighton. This section is the toughest part of the run, as it requires\nthe cars to cross the South Downs,\nincluding the notorious Burgess\nHill and Clayton Hill. Between\nthem, these hills frequently see the\ndownfall of many of the veterans.\nSome people opt to be towed up\nby a modern car, but Bo\u2019 is easily\ncapable of climbing hills in first\ngear, albeit very slowly (walking\nactually is quicker). However,\non Burgess Hill the driver\u2019s side\nheadlamp got its revenge on us\nwhen the bracket snapped and\nit fell off. Fortunately, the rubber\nhose from the acetylene generator saved it from falling onto\nthe tarmac, and one of the marshals\ncame over and removed it for us. It\nspent the rest of the journey in the\nback, keeping Mr. Fok company, while\nBo\u2019 acquired a one-eyed pirate-like ap-pearance. [note to Henry: I WILL repair the lamp bracket, honest!]\nOnce over the top of the hill, we then\nwent down the other side at a terrifying speed, which made Bo\u2019 rattle alarm-ingly. This was very nearly our downfall,\nas on the approach to Clayton Hill, we\nnoticed smoke coming from the engine.\nPulling into the forecourt of a car dealer,\nwe found that the vibration had shaken\na water pipe loose, causing the radiators\nto drain themselves. With no cooling,\nthe smoke was coming from the paint\non the cylinders starting to burn. HastSimon Hamlin writes about the City and Guilds Motor Club\u2019s 60 mile journey across\nundulating terrain from London\u2019s Hyde Park Corner to Madeira Drive in Brighton\nily, we removed the spark plugs and\nsquirted oil into the cylinders, whilst\nturning the engine over to prevent it\nfrom seizing. Two more of the ex-Bo\u2019\ndrivers appeared in a VW camper van,\nand went to get us some water to refill\nthe engine, while we re-sealed the leak.\nWhile we were doing this, we were\npassed by a certain student-festooned,\ngarish pink fire engine.\nWith the leak fixed, we headed onwards for the assault on Clayton Hill.\nNearthetopweencounteredanintriguing veteran traffic jam, headed by one\nof the larger cars that was overcoming\nthe steepness of the hill by meandering\nits way up very slowly. It\u2019s then more-or-less downhill into Brighton. Just on\nthe outskirts of Brighton is a section of\nthree lane road that is the nearest the\nRun gets to a motorway. Very few of\nthe cars on the run are capable of anywhere near the\n40 m.p.h. required for motorway driving,\nso the entire run is still done on A roads, as\nclose as possible to the original 1896 route.\nHowever, the A23 at Brighton feels worry-ingly like a motorway, with the modern traffic zooming past at 70 m.p.h. (honestly, the\nyouth of today, etc.).\nWe finally arrived at the finish line on Madeira Drive in Brighton at 3.55 pm having\ntravelled for nearly seven and a half hours.\nThe 2007 London to Brighton Veteran\nCar Run is on Sunday 4th November.\nBo\u2019 is maintained by Team Bo\u2019, which\nis made up from current students at\nImperial. They meet on Wednesday\nafternoons, when they maintain Bo\u2019,\nthen either going to the Pub, or driving\nacross Hyde Park to the Fish and\nChip shop. Anyone can get involved\n(not just engineers!) and there is no\nmembership fee.

He\ngets a takeaway\nwhenever he is\nat home in his\nconstituency.\u2019\n\u201cBut when\nThe Islington\nCook Book\nasked him the\nsame question he said\nhis favorite\nfood was \u2018fresh\nfettuccini\nA quick reminder that you are what you eat followed by more recipes than you can shake a sausage at\nThis is perfect student food for\nthe upcoming winter months.\nIt\u2019s tasty, warming and filling\nall at the same time. Feel free\nto serve it with ordinary gravy\nmade from granules but nothing beats onion gravy. Dish it\nup with a healthy portion of\nwhatever vegetable you fancy-carrots, peas or broccoli are\nperfect.\nYou\u2019ll need:\nSausages (as many as you\nlike)\n3 potatoes per person\nsalt and pepper to taste\na knob of butter\na splash of milk\nFor the onion gravy:\n1 onion (small for one person,\nlarge for three)\ngravy granules\na drizzle of olive or vegetable\noil\na sprinkle of sugar\n1 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n(optional)\nInstructions\n1. Start cooking the sausages\nas per the cooking instruc-tions. I prefer cooking them in\nthe oven because they need\nless attention than ones frying in a pan. This should take\nThis isn\u2019t nearly as terrifying\nas people think. It just requires\na little bit of attention which\ncan be divided between the\nTV, a magazine or a special\nsomeone\u2026.\nFeel free to use any soft vegetable that you like instead of\nmushrooms, or even cooked\nmeat. Try courgettes, peppers,\npeas, prawns or cooked chick-en, chorizo, etc. Just add them\nat the same stage you would\nadd the mushrooms.\nYou\u2019ll need:\n1 small onion (or \u00bd a large on-ion) chopped\na handful of mushrooms,\nroughly chopped\n1 stock cube (vegetable or\nchicken)\n1 cup of risotto rice\na big knob of butter\na sprig of fresh thyme\n(optional)\nsmall glass of white wine (op-tional) and lastly\nsalt and pepper to taste\nInstructions\n1. Melt the knob of butter in a\nsaucepan and add the chopped\nonion. Cook until soft- this will\ntake about 10 minutes. Add the\nmushrooms and stir.\n2. Add the risotto rice and stir\nuntil coated with the butter.\nCarry on stirring for a few minutes\nuntil the rice starts to go translu-cent. Add the salt and pepper and\nthyme, if using.\n3. Make up half a pint of stock by\nadding boiled water to the stock\ncube. If using wine splash it into\nthe pan at this point and wait until it\nevaporates. If not, just add an extra\ncup of water to the stock and pour\na glass of this into the pan instead,\nagain waiting for it to evaporate.\n4. Keep adding the stock a splash\nat a time, stirring until it evaporates\nand then adding some more.\nThis should take about 20 min-utes, depending on the instructions on the pack of risotto rice.\nIf the stock is finished before the\nrice has cooked just top it up with\nsome hot water instead.\n5. The rice is cooked when it\nhas just a slight bite and it is just\nstarting to go sticky around the\nedges. Don\u2019t overcook it or it will\nturn into porridge. Serve with\nshavings of parmesan if you like\nit and the leftover wine.\nMushroom Risotto\nBangers and mash\nabout 20-30 minutes.\n2. In the meantime, peel and\nchop the potatoes into pieces and\nboil for 20 minutes, until cooked\nthrough. A sharp knife should\ngo straight through without any\nresistance at the end.\n3. While the sausages and potatoes are cooking you can make\nyour onion gravy. Slice the onion\nin half and then cut it into thin\nslices. Heat a drizzle of oil in a\nfrying pan and ccok the onions\nslowly until they soften but are\nnot brown. This will take about\n10-15 minutes. Sprinkle over some\nsugar.\n4. When the onions have cooked\nthrough, make up about a quarter\nof a pint of gravy for each person\nusing granules and boiling water.\nMake it slightly runnier than you\nwould like it because it will thicken\nup. Pour over the onions and\nsplash in the balsamic vinegar if\nusing (the cheap stuff is fine). Stir\nuntil it thickens.\n5. Cook your vegetable in some\nsalted boiling water- carrots take\nabout 6 minutes, broccoli 3, peas\n2.\n6. Drain the potatoes and add\nthe butter, salt and pepper and\nmilk and mash until there are no\nlumps. Serve with the sausages\nand vegetables and a generous\namount of gravy.\nLooks yuck, tastes yum\nHere\u2019s a simple recipe to give\nyour spaghetti dishes that little\nextra something.\nRemember, this recipe contains milk.\n1 Finely chop some onions\nand celery, and fry in olive oil\nuntil translucent, not brown.\n2 Add some chopped car-rots, stirring well to coat\neverything.\n3 Add your mince (beef plus\noptional pork) and a good pinch\nof salt to draw out the fat.\n4 Cook until it has lost its raw\ncolour. Twist in some pepper.\n5 Here\u2019s where it gets leftfield\u2026 Add some whole\nmilk! Enough to almost cover\nthe mince. Bubble it merrily until most of the liquid has\nevaporated.\n6 Now even more surprising,\nadd some white wine! Same\namount as above, and again\nbubble until gone.\n7 Empty in a few cans of\ntinned chopped tomatoes.\n8 Simmer for AT LEAST one\nhour, adding water if it gets too\ndry.\n9 Important to taste for salt at\nthe end.\nRecipe adapted from a definitive book by Marcella Hazan:\nThe Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking.\nCook your own pub grub\ngarnished with an exotic sauce of olive\noil, sun-dried tomatoes and capers\u2019.\u201d\nSo you see, food matters because it\nsays something about you. Gordon\nBrown\u2019s favourite food is probably oat-cakes. David Cameron probably cares\nabout food miles and the plight of the\nBritish farmer.\nAnyway in 2006 it was further revealed that Tony\u2019s favourite food to\ncook was spaghetti bolognese, and I\ncouldn\u2019t agree more. This recipe takes\na brilliant cauldron approach, as the\nmilk phase bubbles into the white wine\nphase, and the all-important lengthy\nsimmer utterly transforms a liquid with\nbits floating around into an unctuous\nand soft, almost homogeneous sauce.\nMany a heinous sinner has abused a\nBolognese recipe by simply not simmering for long enough.\nNote that it contains no secret magic\nadditives, and demonstrates brilliantly\nthat technique is far more important\nthan ingredients. In fact, a good chef\ncan knock up something special from\nany old bag of oddities, hence the\nwonder of Ready Steady Cook. I find\nit extremely satisfying to make the\nbest Bolognese ever from just a few\nstandard ingredients, and no fiddly\nlittle ones. I\u2019m not giving quantities as I never use them and it builds\nconfidence to guess.\nWarning: contains milk and may not look exactly like this\nTrying to eat your words Mr Blair?\nSpaghetti with Milk\nNoel Forrest\n\n"

You\nare given a white full-face mask and a\ncoin like an old fashioned penny. You\nare sent up some steps and through a\ndoor, into darkness. After that, anything can happen.\nThis is the nature of Punchdrunk\u2019s\nwork: that the show will be different for\neach person who sees it. It is theatre as\ntotal immersion. There\u2019s no stage, and\nstrictly speaking there\u2019s no play. You\nare free to wander through the set as\nyou please, which in this case means\nmost of the BAC, from basement to\nattic. There\u2019s a crypt, with walls lined\nwith skulls, there\u2019s a forest, a wine\nroom stocked floor to ceiling with old\nAs a world leading pharmaceutical company, with\none of the industry\u2019s most envied drug pipelines, it\nshould come as no surprise that we\u2019re always\nlooking for scientists to join us.\nBut, it might surprise you to discover that there are\ncritical and challenging opportunities for people\nwith no background in science but with some\ninterest in the pharmaceutical industry. In\nfact, our continued dominance of the\nglobal pharmaceutical market depends\nupon identifying the very best talent, in\nboth the scientific and non science arenas.\nAnd that means that there are all kinds of\nopportunities for talented individuals in a variety of\ndisciplines to join us and build a global career.\nYou\u2019ll be playing a vital role in driving the discovery\nand development of our successes, and helping\npeople around the world live longer, happier,\nhealthier lives.\nTo apply now and find out more\nabout how you can build a truly global\ncareer, please visit our website\nwww.gsk.com/uk-students\nNO SCIENCE?\nNO PROBLEM.\nGSK is proud to promote an open culture, encouraging people to be themselves and giving their ideas a chance to flourish.

You might stumble across a\ns\u00e9ance, a fight, a seduction, a man\u2019s descent into madness. You can choose to\nfollow characters through the building,\nor you can stay in a room and wait for\nthe action to arrive.\nIt is, unquestionably, an extraordinary experience. The extent of the\nset is mind-boggling. Open a drawer\nin a sideboard \u2013 it is full of old documents and letters. Run your hands over\nthe fabric of the chairs, the beds, the\ndrapes. Take your old penny and exchange it for a velvet cape you can wear\nfor the rest of the evening. The most\nmemorable moments are likely to be\nunique to you. At one point, I sat down\nin a chair in a dark room, felt something lumpy, and found that I\u2019d sat on a\nsleeping black cat. The cat looked un-perturbed. I apologised to it profusely.\nSome time later, the man in the wine\nroom told me how he hated the black\ncat, and fed me one of its eyes (a green\nolive) on a cocktail stick.\nThere\u2019s a reason, though, that I\nhaven\u2019t yet mentioned what the show is\nabout. \u2018The Masque of the Red Death\u2019\nis an Edgar Allan Poe story in which\na country is hit by a plague, and the\nprince of the land invites a thousand\nof his friends to live in luxury inside\nhis abbey where, they believe, the Red\nDeath cannot reach them. But if you\ndidn\u2019t know the story already, there\u2019s\nno way you would guess it from seeing\nthis show. The same goes for the other\nPoe stories that are featured. There are\nsnippets of \u2018The Cask of Amontillado\u2019,\n\u2018The Fall of the House of Usher\u2019, and,\nnaturally, \u2018The Black Cat\u2019, but they don\u2019t\ngo anywhere. It\u2019s like nothing so much\nas a Poe themed haunted house \u2013 there\nare atmospheres, characters, places,\nbut not much of more substance than\nthat. It\u2019s a little disappointing.\nAnd the show being what it is, much\nof your experience will depend on the\nbehaviour of the rest of the audience.\nThe night I went, there were a gaggle\nof teenage girls whose screaming and\ngiggling was enough to send a deep\ncrack through this imaginary world for\nme. I might have avoided them better\nif there hadn\u2019t seemed to be too many\npeople in the space. Sometimes there\nwere so many watchers crammed into\na room, you couldn\u2019t see the action.\nSometimes you couldn\u2019t get in through\nthe door. With tickets starting at \u00a320\nfor concessions, I can\u2019t help wondering\nif the company has got a bit greedy.\nAt the end of the night, I spoke to\none of the stewards. He asked what I\nthought of the show. It wasn\u2019t as good\nas \u2018Faust\u2019, I told him. He said that that\u2019s\nbeen the general consensus. \u2018Faust\u2019,\nPunchdrunk\u2019s production last year,\ntook over five floors of a warehouse in\nWapping. It used essentially the same\nform, but there was more story and\nmore space. It was more haunting and\nmore surprising. So if you saw \u2018Faust\u2019,\n\u2018Red Death\u2019 is more of the same, only\nnot as good. If you didn\u2019t see \u2018Faust\u2019, the\nwhole thing will be novel, but this isn\u2019t\nthe company at the top of its game.\nGo. By all means go. It\u2019s extraordi-nary. But you\u2019ve been warned.\nWatcha ya lookin at?\n\n"

Someone was prodding me with\na stick and saying things like \u201cMickey\nMouse\u201d and \u201cdamn silly\u201d, which turned\nout not to be summaries of my bodily\nbits, but something to do with my edu-cation. And then a man turned up and\nsmiled and said that everything was\nokay because they were going to make\nit harder for me to have a nice life, and\nthen everyone went away murmuring.\nWell, who\u2019d have thought it \u2013 it\nturns out that Oxbridge aren\u2019t taking in that many students from poor\nbackgrounds. Could be because generalisations work, and a lot of people in\nlow social demographics tend to have\nbad education and motivation. Or, far\nmore sensibly if you\u2019re a politician, it\u2019s\nbecause the whole damn system needs\nreforming. Of course. Brilliant.

The Rector, being the massive,\nred rector that he is, brought out the\nbroken five thousand pound grama-phone out and started winding it up\nwhile the head of our student union\nannounced that the idea of taxes paying for education was a horrifically\n\u2018unrealistic\u2019 idea and that we should\nprobably ask the students just to make\nsure they don\u2019t want to pay through the\nnose to be overworked, under appreciated and probably unemployed at the\nend of it all. And then to top it all off,\nthe Government suggest that people\nwho don\u2019t want to go to university are\nactually just using reverse psychology,\nand what they really want is for us to\nbully them into oblivion until they have\nno choice but to sign up to the dullest\ncourse they can find.\nCongratulations, everyone! Your\nbandwagons look lovely and I\u2019m sure\nyou took a long time setting them up.\nFirst of all \u2013 given that the Rector is the head of one of Britain\u2019s best\nUniversities (I don\u2019t say it very often,\nbut Imperial deserves its position in\nleague tables) that consistently attracts\ngenuinely enthused people to further\neducation, it seems a little unfair for\nhim to prop up the notion of \u2018degree\nA. Geek\nequals job lol\u2019 and then rant about how\nwe don\u2019t pay enough for the privilege\nof being ushered into a job at Canary\nWharf. The man wants five thousand\npounds a year from each and every one\nof us, when most of us are hard-work-ing students looking to reach the edges\nof our chosen field. Then, on the other\nside of town, we\u2019re paying kids \u00a330 a\nweek to take subjects that they really\ndon\u2019t want to take, when they\u2019d probably get much more satisfaction from\nstarting apprenticeships and training\nfor something that they genuinely en-joy. Doesn\u2019t that system seem a little\nwrong to you?\nMoreworryingly,thePresidentofImperial\u2019s Student Union seems to agree\nthat our education should somehow\nbe entirely self-funded. Sorry, \u2018pending\na consultation with the student body\u2019\nis the official line, although \u2018consultation\u2019 is probably the last thing it would\nbe possible to do with this particular\nstudent body, so I can only assume it\u2019s\ncode for \u2018Guys, I\u2019m not really a fan of\nour policy right now, so I\u2019m going to\nchange it. All in favour, be me.\u2019 Change\nit to what, exactly? Are you honestly\nsuggesting that students are going to\nvoluntarily ask to be wrung dry? Even\nif we didn\u2019t genuinely want to learn,\nwe\u2019d hardly be standing up and saying,\n\u2018You know what? I do have thirty thousand pounds I\u2019m not using.\u2019\nThe fact is this \u2013 taxes go to fund\nthings that can\u2019t pay for themselves\nin order to keep the country working.\nUltimately, the government we vote in\ndecides what that means. I\u2019d suggest\nthe following \u2013 young people today are\ngoing to get older and run the country.\nEncouraging them to do it well might\nnot be such a bad idea.\nAnd that, of course, neatly brings us\nto the third link in this chain of ingenuity \u2013 John Denham and the Governmental Hallows.\n\u2018Raising aspirations\u2019 means not telling people to sod off when they ask for\nFurther Maths to be offered at their\nsecondary schools. What it doesn\u2019t\nmean is mentally brutalising sixth-formers more than they already are,\nand convincing anyone still wearing a\nschool uniform that the only way into\nadulthood is via UCAS.\nAspiration means desire to learn.\nSimple as. It\u2019s not something you can\ncharge for.\n\u201c\nThus the can\nof shit-covered\nworms was\nopened, and\nthrown into the\nfan\nThe Union\u2019s view\nH\naving spent a considerable part of my summer\nattending conferences\non the subject, the\nphrase \u201cfree education\u201d\nreally has become tiresome. Since the\nintroduction of means tested tuition\nfees in 1997 a significant number of\nsabbatical officers and their comrades\nin the National Union of Students\n(NUS \u2013 it is currently costing you\n\u00a344,000 per annum) have been gratifying themselves with a never ending cycle of self-congratulatory pep\ntalks where they extol the virtues of a\nhigher education (HE) system which is\nfunded entirely by the taxpayer. This is\nthe funding model that was used when\nonly a fraction of school leavers went\non to University but it is now widely\nacknowledged to be unaffordable. For\nillustrative purposes, with the current\nlevel of undergraduates the cost to the\ntaxpayer of returning to the system of\nuniversal grants would be equivalent\nto 153 hospitals. Last Monday Union\nCouncil scrapped our policy in favour\nof free education and acknowledged\nthat the debate has moved on and it is\nno longer a realistic stance to take.\nThe initial opposition of students to\nthe concept of a graduate contribution\nwas understandable as after all, it is\nhuman nature to prefer something free\nover something you have to now pay\nfor. What has not helped students is\nthe irresponsible scaremongering that\nstudents\u2019 unions and the NUS have\nindulged in with regards to the issue\nof HE funding. If anything, the NUS\nhave done far more than top-up fees to\nput students off going to University by\nsticking to their childish line that \u201cfees\nare terrible\u201d and failing to publicise the\nenhanced bursary packages that are\nnow available. Exactly how many potential students have been deterred by\ntheir sub-Marxist dogma will never be\nknown but their hysterical response to\ngraduate contributions certainly hasn\u2019t\nhelped. Opposing fees, top-up fees,\nlifting the cap on fees are all valid positions to take but your credibility suffers\nif you continue to argue (as students\ndid) that any of these actions would\nhave a disastrous impact on admissions\n(they didn\u2019t) and the end of the world\nthat you predicted never comes. I don\u2019t\nthink Imperial students would benefit\nif my fellow sabbaticals and I joined in\nthis permanent revolution against the\nwhole concept of graduate contribu-tion. What exactly is to be gained from\nspending my year in office indulging in\nthe debate of yesteryear?\nSo what now? EU undergraduates\nstudying at Imperial College now pay\n\u00a33000 up front in tuition fees. This is\npaid for by a subsidised student loan\nthat you begin to pay back after your\ngraduate earnings reach a certain level.\nI don\u2019t particularly like getting a letter\nImperial\nCollege\nUnion\nfrom the student loan company once\na year detailing that I now owe them\nover \u00a320,000 but what are the alterna-tives? Increased rates of personal taxa-tion? Fewer university places? A tax\nthat is levied only on graduates? These\nare some of the suggestions currently\nin circulation. The aim of this piece\nis to start a bit of a debate about what\nthe student body thinks about how our\nUniversities should be funded.\nA common view held by Imperial\nundergraduates is that it is unfair that\nstudents studying the difficult, work\nintensive courses get the same level of\nsupport as people studying the quirkier\ncourses that the Rector was referring\nto. The argument in favour of expanding the HE sector was an economic\none as the government argued that we\nneed more people with graduate level\nskills in order for the UK to remain\neconomically competitive. Does it not\nfollow that market mechanisms should\nbe in place to ensure that such a system is funded in a way that provides an\nincentive for marginal users of education to embark on courses where the\ngraduates holding those degrees are in\nthe greatest demand? The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) have recently come out in favour of additional\nbursaries for students embarking on\nscience and engineering courses as a\nmeans to address the fact that industry\nis faced with a dire shortage of these\nskills yet at the same time is presented\nwith a massive oversupply of humanities graduates. What exactly would the\nbenefit be to the UK if the government\nreached its somewhat arbitrary target\nof sending 50% of young people to University if half of these decided to study\nEnglish, Politics or Psychology when\nthere is such a limited demand for people with those skills?\nThe term \u201cfree education\u201d is a complete misnomer. Education isn\u2019t free,\nespecially the expensive lab-based\ncourses that are on offer at Imperial.\nSomeone, somewhere has to pay for it\nand anyone who pretends otherwise is\nbeing less than honest. I look forward\nto hearing your views (either in Felix, via email or at one of the forums\nthe Union will be hosting) on top-up\nfees, as the Union Council would like\nto consult as widely as possible whilst\npulling together students ideas on\nthis topic. At a later date I will write\na slightly more colourful account of\nsome of the exchanges I have had with\nthe \u201cfree education\u201d brigade but that\nwould quickly turn in to a bit of a rant.\nI am sure you can imagine how frustrating it is trying to engage someone\nin an adult conversation only to find\nthem giving you a 40 minute lecture on\nwhy the UK should be more like Venezuela and what students would gain\nfrom demonstrating \u201csolidarity\u201d with\nGreek Trotskyites! It\u2019s over to you.\nSteve Brown\nPresident\nAn Educational Debate Special\nLast week the Union announced it will be revising its stance on university education funding, the Rector\nwent off on one about \u201cMickey Mouse courses\u201d and an MP called for school-university \u201cpartnerships\u201d\n. This\nweek Felix hears from the Union President, the Pugwash society, a physicist and, oh, of course A.

    "content": "35\nfelix\nFriday 19 October 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nOne for the ladies this week\nChiraush Patel\nMr. Muscle\nSports league\nThis week, I would just like to send\na shout out to all my female readers!\nWhether you\u2019re attracted by the mind-blowing photos on show, or just like to\nleave this page open in front of your\npodgy boyfriend (as a hint), you\u2019ve\nstuck through what may seem to have\nbeen a testosterone tidal wave week after week. So this issue is for you, as I\noffer you some advice on maximising\nyour gym sessions.\nFirst and foremost if you are happy\nwith your body then don\u2019t be coerced\ninto gyming for sake of other people.\nMr Muscle is a firm believer in self\nlove, not in that manner of course (un-less it makes you happy\u2026), but if you\nthink that you could do with some\nguidance when it comes to working\nout then you\u2019re in the right place.\nThe free weights section of a gym is\noften overlooked by the fairer sex. It\nmay appear to be an intense, intimi-dating, machismo manic area, but look\npast all that and you will find that free\nweights are an amazing way to tone up\nand really get results.\nBut won\u2019t most guys just stare at me?\nNope. The truth is most of us genuine\nweight lifters (aka non desperate men)\nprefer to check out our form in the\nmirror, so don\u2019t feel intimidated and\nthink that all eyes are on you\u2026unless\nyou\u2019re really asking for it.\nWhy should I bother with weights?\nIt\u2019s true, most women prefer to start\nand end gym sessions on cardio ma-chines, with some more cardio sandwiched in between, but this is an inefficient way of toning. Recent studies\nsuggest that a split session of weights,\nconsolidated with cardio can result in\nup to 100% more fat loss than cardio\nalone. Whether you\u2019re from Venus,\nMars or Planet Hollywood, that has\ngot to be music to your ears! So buckle up for a satisfying session with the\nlean, mean, muscle machine, today and\nevery month, as I tackle the feminine\nfigure part by part, starting with my\nfavourite: legs.\nThe perfect set of pins is a holy grail\nto most ladies, but their importance\nruns deeper than the superficial, a\nbit like Mr Muscle himself. The legs\ncontain the largest muscle in terms of\nmass, and as such are akin to fat burning machines. By keeping them running you are making sure your body is\nburning fat even when you\u2019re enjoying\nyour cosmo, G&T or Carlsberg (shout\nout to my lager lasses!). Plus it will help\nyou knock over the lads when you rock\nthe short skirts!\nAs with any workout session, start\nyour day with a 5 minute warm up run\nthen hit the listed leg workout. If you\nhave any problems don\u2019t hesitate to ask\nfor advice from gym staff or myself if\nyou see me. Otherwise there is always\nemail.\nPile squats: stand erect with your\nfeet far wider than shoulder width, toes\nangled out. Keep your back flat with\npelvis in, chest out and shoulders back,\nholding the dumbbell rested down\nin front of your body. Squat straight\ndown until your thighs are parallel\nto the floor. Pause at the bottom and\nwithout bouncing rise in a smooth,\ncontrolled manner focusing on your\nglutes and hams.\nStiff legged deadlift: stand erect\nholding dumbbells in front of your\nthighs with palms facing your legs.\nChest out, shoulders back, knees unlocked and head facing forward relative\nto your back. In a slow and controlled\nmotion, bend over and push your hips\nback until your torso is nearly parallel to the floor, keeping your back flat\nthroughout. Smoothly reverse the direction and rise back up to standing.\nDumbbell squats with bench: position a bench 6-8 inches behind you and\nadopt the above starting position with\ndumbbells by the side of your body.\nSlowly descend, pushing your glutes\nback until you gently touch the bench.\nWithout sitting on it smoothly reverse\nthe direction to return to the starting position. Throughout the exercise\nmaintain a straight back.\nDon\u2019t thank me, I\u2019m just doing my\njob, but buy a drink and join me in a\ntoast- to a more beautiful gym!\nFelix takes no responsibility if you\nbreak yourself in half whilst trying\nto lift weights that are clearly too\nheavy for you. Man up!\nWeek 2 and a lot more results are in.\nThe ranking of the teams is based on\nthe Felix Index (FI), which is calculated\nas follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) \u2013 (L*3).\nOnly teams with 5 games or more will\nbe considered in the overall championship at the end of year. With this weeks\nresults in, badminton move to 2nd\nwhilst the hockey men\u2019s 3rds are at the\nbottom of the table with -8 points.\nACROSS\n1 A mixture of HP Brown sauce with\nsugar \u2013 fit fot nobility (8)\n6 I am back in the citadel with its\nnew layout (6)\n9 Bisexual surrounds symbols in an\nEastern land (6)\n10 Prevent holes \u2013 as a temporary\nmeasure (8)\n11 At ETA\u2019s center, the center\u2019s\ncenter\u2019s lost.

For the last\n20 years or so RCS Motor Club has\ntaken a small village of tents, a motley bunch of students and enough\npetrol and gas to raze a small village\nto the Isle of Wight, all for a five-day\ncamping extravaganza. Thankfully\nwe don\u2019t need to rely on the Union\u2019s\nminibus fleet for the 200-mile round\ntrip, as our method of transport is\nmuch more reliable: Jezebel, Imperial\u2019s 1916 Dennis \u2018N\u2019 Type Fire Engine. She may be 91 years old, but is\none of the few vehicles not to have\nbeen rolled or crashed into trees,\nmountains or supermarkets by the\nOutdoor or Mountaineering Clubs.\nOver the summer RCSMC took Jez\nhundreds of miles around the south\nof England for fire shows, historic vehicle rallies and anything else which\ntook our fancy. We always drive Jez\nto these events, so in between there\u2019s\na lot of maintenance work to be done\nto keep her in running order \u2013 oil,\ngrease and students are consumed\nwith every trip and need replenish-ing. By the end of August the crew\nwere exhausted but Jez was still up for\na bit more travelling, so we took her to\nplay with steam engines for the bank\nholiday weekend. The Island Steam\nShow brings together large traction\nengines, a steam fair, historic vehicles\nand the steam railway for the August\nbank holiday weekend.\nJust before 7am on the 23rd August\nour support vehicle raced out of London to beat the congestion charge,\nwhile we loaded the last of our belongings and prepared the scarlet lady for\nher trip. We followed in short order,\n\u201cracing\u201d away at 20mph for a ninety\nmile journey to Portsmouth (via the\nscenic route \u2013 the A3 is a bit \u2026 scary).\nWe were racing the rain out of London\ntoo \u2013it poured down all day, but we\u2019d\ngot out early. \u201cDeluge\u201d is not the word\nyou want to hear on the weather forecast before going out on a vehicle with\nno roof or windscreen.\nOur journey was mostly uneventful\n\u2013 no bits falling off, no drivers trying to\nkill us and only one instance of smoke\npouring off the brakes as we tried to\nstop 5 tons of fire engine charging\ndown a very steep hill. A quick trip\nto Tesco to grab supplies and we were\nable to erect our canvas village, park\nup for the night and head to the highlight of the trip: the beer tent! The beer\nfestival accompanying the steam show\nprovided over 40 real ales from around\nthe UK and a variety of ciders for those\nwith less well refined taste buds.\nThe highlight of the trip for new\ndrivers has always been the time trial:\nan obstacle course consisting of a slalom and three parking boxes, requiring slick gear changes and no stalling!\nThe aim is to get the fastest time of\nthe weekend, racing against traction\nengines, steam cars, military vehicles\nand quad bikes. Jez is always at somewhat of a disadvantage \u2013 weighing five\ntons with solid slick tyres on wet grass\ndoesn\u2019t give good traction, often leading to a whining sound and mud being\nflung at spectators as the rear wheels\nspin hopelessly. After a shocking time\nof 1m 01s on the first day we decided\nto try out the new clutch bearing we\u2019d\nmanufactured six weeks previously.\nWith Jez squealing away in second gear\nwe achieved our fastest time of 47s, but\nrealised perhaps we shouldn\u2019t do that\nagain \u2013 at least until we\u2019d adjusted it to\n\u201csports mode\u201d.\nThe Sunday evening saw some 40\nhistoric commercial vehicles head out\nfor a forty mile road run, thrashing\ntheir vehicles on the steep gradients\naround the island. Having been told\n\u201cplease don\u2019t criticise my English\u201d by\nthe person who wrote the directions\nbefore we left, we ended up 4 miles\ninland from where we should have\nbeen, utterly lost with nothing but\nour wits and our GPS units to save us.\nGPS units which subsequently sent us\ndown roads barely wide enough for\nJez, let alone the poor unsuspecting\ntraffic coming the other way.\nWe finally arrived at the halfway\npoint 30 minutes after everyone else,\njust as they were about to leave. After a brief pause to add extra layers\nclothing \u2013 the sun was going down\nfast and the temperature with it \u2013\nwe set off again, miraculously ending up in the middle of the convoy.\nIt had nothing to do with taking a\nshortcut and knocking 10 miles off\nthe journey, honest\u2026\nWith good weather all weekend\nwe were in high spirits on MonAshley Brown reports on the Royal College of Science Motor Club\u2019s recent trip\nto the Isle of Wight, featuring oil, a moronic granny and beer\nday evening when it came to pack away\nand prepare for an early start on the\nTuesday. Our journey back turned into\na pub crawl as we tried to stall until\nthe end of congestion charging, finally\ncrossing dreaded red circles at 6:06pm.\nOnly a moronic old granny determined\nto write off her car on the front of Jez\nmarred the journey back, resulting in a\nradiator leak after we pulled up a kerb\nto get out of her way: who would have\nthought 65 year olds would get road\nrage because they couldn\u2019t drive at\n70mph?\nYou\u2019ll see Jez out and about for\nmost of the year, for the first\ncouple months with the radiator\nleak! Whether you\u2019re interested\nin the mechanical, the social, or\nthe weekend trips away, stop us\nand have a chat or drop an email\nto jez@imperial.ac.uk. To find out\nmore about Jez and her history,\nhead over to http://union.ic.ac.\nuk/jez/\nOoooh, ghostly!\nJohn \u2018I ate all the pies\u2019 James\nconsumes another one\nWhere do all these bolts go?\n\n"

Welcome to the\nfourth instalment from\nthe fourth, the last,\nbut by no means the least arts editor.\nFirst, big thanks to our other lovely\narty editor Rosie for doing tube map/\nculture crawl layout for me whilst I\nlay in bed, body fighting an army of\ncold viruses, having used the last of\nmy reserves on theatrical content for\nsaid tube map.\nFlick over the page for this week\u2019s\nCulture Crawl courtesy of my co-edi-tor Mike Cook- a must read for those\nbookworms among you, followed by a\nmust-do as you trawl our nation\u2019s capital to leaf through the virgin pages of\nnewly printed books, and not-so-vir-gin, well-thumbed pages of antiquarian books.\nMore literary cunning comes in the\nform of poetic respite for the scientific mind- John Keats\u2019 \u201cLa Belle Dame\nSans Merci\u201d, our poem of the week.\nAfter reading, cut it out and stick it in\nyour copy of Darwin\u2019s \u201cOrigin of Species\u201d or what you will, then come back\nand visit us again next week for another lyrical gem. If Romantic sensual\nimagery isn\u2019t your volition then take\nsolace in the life and genius of Oscar\nWilde, an amazing article I dreamed\nup, a few inches to your right. Alternatively be engulfed by the review\nof a Red Plague from one of our new\nwriters.\nOutside the confines of our beloved\nFelix, the erudite Imperialist might\nlike to pop down to \u201cPop Art\u201d at the\nNational Portrait Gallery. (Pun absolutely fully intended). Popular Art\nreally does seem to be flavour of the\nweek with the Gagosian and Hayward\ngalleries showing \u201cPop Art Is\u2026\u201d and\n\u201cThe Painting of Modern Life\u201d re-spectively. The Barbican\u2019s \u201cSeduced\nArt\u201d promises to shock some, disgust\nsome and delight some, rather like\nthis week\u2019s centrefold. It explores\nsex through the medium of art from\nantiquity to now, spanning many different cultures and artists including\nWarhol. \u2018Is it art or is it porn?\u2019 asks\nThe Telegraph. Who cares! It sounds\nbrilliant so go along and if you do, be\na dear and send us your review- we\nwould all love to hear about it.\nApparently I was remiss in omitting The Royal Court from my Culture Crawl last week. I do apologise.\nLocated just a stop away at Sloane\nSquare, I have yet to visit but as soon\nas I do I will tell you all about it in\nthese here pages.\nLastly, this week\u2019s Student Art in\nFocus comes from a student giving us\nhis artistic impression of Felix editor,\nTom. You may be interested in knowing that yours truly is attending Avenue Q at the Noel Coward theatre this\nweek and so come back next week to\nhear all about muppet puppet sex and\npolitical incorrect-ness! You stay sexy\nImperial College.\nWilde Things and Jude Law\nCaz Knight delves into the dynamic genius of Oscar Wilde and his lover Jude Law\nM\ny long and carefully\nschemed plan is to\nenlighten, to interest (hopefully) and to\nbring a bit of artistic\nlight into the lives of my fellow Imperial Science geeks. I thought I would\nmake your Friday, or indeed whichever day you happen to chance upon\nthe Arts section, a little bit special by\nproviding you with some nuggets of\nknowledge on some of our most iconic\nplaywrights. Unlike many instances in\nscience, in art everyone can be right\nand so my opinion on who qualifies as\nthe most superior purveyor of plays is\nsubject to debate. As much as I would\nlike to write reams and reams on every\nplaywright I can fathom, I have to stick\nto some sort of word limit so I have\nhand selected one for now which I hold\nclose to my own heart.\nIn prime position- the man who\nshould be ranked above William\nShakespeare himself, Oscar Wilde.\nFirstly, let us wish the literary genius\na belated happy birthday for October\n16th. Hailed as the greatest wits of our\ntime, Oscar Fingal O\u2019Flahertie Wills\nWilde was born in Dublin in 1854 to a\ndoctor, William, and a writer, Jane. He\nhad two other siblings one of which,\nEmily, he had a special fondness for.\nHer sudden death deeply affected him\nand so he proceeded to carry with him\na locket of her hair in a decorated enve-lope. He excelled at school gaining second prize for drawing in his last years,\nbefore receiving a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin; a jack of all trades\nit seems. After graduating in Classics,\nOscar obtained yet another scholarship to study \u201cMods\u201d and \u201cGreats\u201d at\nMagdalen College, Oxford- where he\nwould graduate with a First Class de-gree. Not only a playwright, he produced poems and also one novel- The\nPicture of Dorian Gray (1891), as well\nas touring America as a lecturer. Despite having a penchant for sexy men,\nOscar married Constance Lloyd in\n1884 and fathered two children in the\nfollowing two years. Later on, in 1891\nhe met lover Lord Alfred \u2018Bosie\u2019 Douglas, an undergraduate at Oxford. Those\nof you familiar with the outstanding\ncinematic portrayal of his life, Wilde,\nwill remember Jude Law\u2019s characteri-sation of Bosie, complete with teddy\nbear Aloysius. (Orlando Bloom also\nhas a walk on role.) Sadly, Wilde\u2019s artistic flame was cruelly extinguished as\na result of two years hard labour following his arrest in 1895 for sodomy.\nNeedless to say Constance fled to Switzerland with the children. I can say this\nnow because homosexuality is no longer a crime or looked upon in the same\nway, but had I been Constance I would\nhave remained with Oscar if only to be\nsurrounded by such a superb mind! He\nlived the remainder of his years in Paris\nuntil November 1900 where he died.\nHe is now buried in La P\u00e8re Lachaise\ncemetery (where Jim Morrison, of The\nDoors fame, would be buried seventy-one years later.) I don\u2019t think there is\na single quotation of Oscar Wilde\u2019s\nwhich does not demonstrate his insight\nand perception which made his work\nsuch a rich and dramatic portrayal of\nthe human condition as it was in the\nVictorian era. \u201cThe world is a stage but\nthe play is badly cast\u201d and \u201cOnly dull\npeople are brilliant at breakfast\u201d. No\ndoubt his influence is indelible and\nwill continue to be so. Although it may\nbe a whimsical conclusion to come to,\nI like to think that Stephen Fry (who\ntakes on the role of Wilde in the film)\npossesses some of the intellect which\nWilde evidently had- the kind that\nmakes you want to read every book\never written and know everything. It is\nsad that had Wilde lived in today\u2019s infinitely more accepting world he might\nhave gone on to produce more sublime\nwork. Fry came in as 3rd greatest wit\nas voted by the British public. Not\nonly was Fry\u2019s performance magical as\nalways, but the striking resemblance\nwhen Fry sports Wilde\u2019s flowing locks\nis uncanny. Many of you might recall\nbeing read The Happy Prince (1888) as\na child. My personal favourites include\nLady Windemere\u2019s fan (1892), An Ideal\nHusband (1895) and The Importance\nof being Earnest (1895), all of which\nhave been made into rather brilliant\nfilms. One of my favourite books is The\nWicked Wit of Oscar Wilde- hundreds\nof Wilde\u2019s quotes to bask in- and offers all sorts of wisdom and everything\nmatter of importance: money, women,\nmen, love and life! Those of you bursting to see one of his plays in the next\nweek should head down to the Richmond Theatre where The Importance\nof Earnest is being put on.\nI would love to stay and write lots\nmore on the great Irish playwright\nbut I feel I have left out so many other\nbrilliant men. I\u2019m sorry to betray my\nsex but I can\u2019t, off the top of my head,\nthink of any female playwrights of sig-nificance- please enlighten me. Just\nto whet your appetite for a later date-Bertolt Brecht, Arthur Miller, Henrik\nIbsen, Anton Pavlovich Chekov, Noel\nCoward, Alan Bennett, R.C. Sherriff,\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, Garcia Lorca\nand Thomas Hardy. I know Hardy\nwrote books but he is amazing too so\ndeserves a small mention.\nWhat\u2019s the point, you might ask.\nUnderstanding of literature in all its\nguises, in my opinion, enriches our\nunderstanding of language and the\nworld around us (apologies, that was\nnot meant to read as hideously clich\u00e9\nand cheese-laden as it came out!) And\nif nothing else it makes you sound well\nread and enviously cultured. Should we\never be short on space for the Arts sec-tion, I will lavish more literary, artistic\nand possibly even musical wisdom on\nyou again.\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nJude casts a furtive glance out the window before returning to bed with the nanny, or was it the cleaner?\n\u201cI have nothing to declare but my genius\u201d, something I\u2019m sure all at IC can idetify with\n\n"

Not\njust books, but everything that might relate to it, the Borders off Leicester Square\nholds music, film, coffee, television shows, bags, as well as a massive selection of\nbooks spread across all manner of areas.\nBest Bit \u2013 It\u2019s all in one place, so when you\u2019re planning your Christmas shopping in\na month\u2019s time, you could do a lot worse than spend a day in there wandering, sipping\ncoffee and taking in every single floor of money pits.\nwww.bordersstores.co.uk\nThe Science Museum Library\nYes, we had to do it. You\u2019re registered there for free, and it has an extensive collection of scientific\ntexts on a massive range of topics. It\u2019s not exactly bursting with fiction or books about gardening\nbut what the library does have, it has in droves. Textbooks, popular science, papers and a well-maintained catalogue system. It\u2019s also quite underused, so whatever you\u2019re looking for is likely to\nbe in stock once you find it.\nBest Bit \u2013 If the SML has a best bit, it\u2019s probably the location. It\u2019s a ten minute walk from most\ndepartments on the Kensington campus, and even if you\u2019re not local it\u2019s central London which\nmeans it\u2019s not a wasted journey to get there.\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/library\nDaunt Books, Marylebone\nLocated on Marylebone\u2019s main high street, Daunt Books has the feel of a true book shop. Soft light\npours in through skylights, the shelves are mostly panelled in a beautiful oak, and of course \u2013 it\u2019s\nquiet. Most interestingly, Daunt Books arranges its wares by country, rather than genre or author,\nmeaning that its travel-orientation is arranged for simple and unusual browsing.\nBest Bit \u2013 You might be surprised to learn that despite its relative independence, Daunt Books\nholds some fairly interesting talks. John O\u2019Farrell will be talking about his latest humour book later\nthis month, and the setting really makes meeting authors quite special.\nwww.dauntbooks.co.uk\nChapter Four \u2013 Bookshops and Libraries\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n22 felix Friday 19 October 2007\nMusic\nMusic Editors \u2013 Jenny Gibson and Matty Hoban\nA pick\u2019n\u2019mix of reviews\nMost music fans from the hardcore/\npunk circles in the UK will remember\nThrice from their 2002 opus \u2018Illusion\nof Safety\u2019 and the more sonically ambitious \u2018Artist in the Ambulance\u2019 from\n2003. Hailing from a scene with bands\nsuch as Brand New and Glassjaw, what\nset this California four-piece apart\nfrom the pack was their fervent lyrical\nhonesty, versatile technical abilities and\nvenerable eschewal from marketing\ntheir haircuts over their music. They\nhave since released a DVD of live performances in 2004 and an unabashedly\nexperimental record inspired by the\nThomas Pynchon novel called \u2018Vheissu\u2019 in 2005, which marked a significant\ndeparture from the earlier punk sound\nfor the band and showcased their love\nof such genre-defying outfits as Radiohead and Deftones.\nNow they plan on releasing a four-part concept record titled \u2018Earth, Air,\nWater and Fire\u2019 (Collectively titled\n\u2018The Alchemy Index\u2019) over the course\nof 2007-08. As of now, the \u2018Fire\u2019 and\n\u2018Water\u2019 EPs are set for release on\n15/10/07. From the starting track \u2018Firebreather\u2019 of the \u2018Fire\u2019 installment it\nis clear that their music is now so far\naway from their humble post-hardcore\nbeginnings that the only recognizable element are the vocals. This track\ncombines crunchy Tool-esque guitars,\nmelodic vocals and a lush atmospheric\nunderbelly to create an overall epic\nsound. Songs such as \u2018The Arsonist\u2019\nand \u2018The Flame Deluge\u2019 go from intricately soft to bludgeoning heaviness in\nthe space of a second and drift through\nso many genres that it makes one realise that classifying artists in terms of\nsingle styles really misses the point of\nmusic. Perhaps the most ambitious offerings of the series are on the \u2018Water\u2019\ndisc, where the band exhibit the true\nbreadth of their music tastes by fusing everything from electronic beats\nto haunting Rhodes piano sounds. One\nsuch standout song is \u2018Digital Sea\u2019, mixing an industrial drum feel with sweetly\nmelodic vocal harmonies which slowly\nmorph into a robotic hush at the end.\n\u2018Lost continent\u2019 and \u2018Night Diving\u2019 are\ntwo more \u2018Water\u2019 tracks which incorporate beautiful layers of atmospheric\nsounds to go alongside blurbs of guitar\nand elysian vocals, much in the vein\nof Sigur Ros. After hearing the available songs, it becomes apparent that\nwhereas \u2018Fire\u2019 contains more incendiary and heavy tracks which lyrically\naddress flames and other fire-y themes,\n\u2018Water\u2019 delves on maritime and aquatic\nthemed grounds and delivers more intricately structured and sonically lush\nsound-scapes.\nWith their latest offering, Thrice\nhave managed to make an album-se-ries more compelling than a thousand\ntop-ten discs and have been successful\nin touching on more genres of music\nthan that in the most eclectic listener\u2019s\nlibrary. Judging by the musicianship\non display on the first two EPs, one\ncan expect the next two to be equally\nprogressive and hugely experimental.\nListening to this four-EP musical juggernaut is like reading a quality book-if you give it the time and patience you\nwill become enlightened, otherwise\nyou will remain an afflicted soul who\nmissed out on one of modern-music\u2019s\nmost overlooked hallmarks.\nUshnish Banerjee\nWe have a couple of reviews that were picked out of the depths of our grips including\na lovely mixture of Post-Hardcore, Indie and Ragga-Hop\u2019n\u2019Bass or something\nThis is a quirky little debut album for\nyet another indie band from the grand\nold city of Leeds. \u201cBuen Chico\u201d; Spanish for \u201cGood Bloke\u2019, are waiting to have\n\u2018Right To Rearrange\u2019 released on CD\non the 22nd of October (or for those of\nyou who can\u2019t wait, it is on download\nfrom the 15th).\nThis album is the perfect thing to\nfill that hole now that the Kooks, Super Furry Animals and the Feeling\nhave been done to death and we\u2019re all\nsearching through our CD collection\nfor something a little new. Lyrically the\nsongs are about as mentally stimulating as the opening theme tune of Teletubbies, but hey, they got to Number\nOne didn\u2019t they?\n\u2018Choosing My Religion\u2019 has a funky\nlittle rhythm that will have emos nationwide dancing on their bed in their\nskinny jeans. Just as the song feels like\nit\u2019s getting a bit too repetitive it takes\na turn and the tempo goes up some-hey, that\u2019s a bit unusual for this genre\nof music, a song with a climax to it!\nAnd that seems to be the style of Buen\nChico, just as soon as you start to get\ntoo comfortable with a piece, they do\nsomething a little unusual to grab your\nattention again.\n\u2018Laying Down the Law\u2019 looks set\nto be another crowd-pleaser with a\nsteady guitar base and somewhat predictable chord changes (don\u2019t you just\nlove them). The tune remains bouncy\nand largely pleasing with some cute\nlittle guitar riffs thrown in for good\nmeasure. Horrah.\nThe introduction to \u2018Don\u2019t Lose Your\nFaith In Goodwill\u2019 sounds a bit like a\nBeatles track- if you\u2019re anything like\nme, that\u2019s never bad but that\u2019s not all\nthat this song has to offer, as about one\nand a half minutes in the song takes off\ninto a personality of its own leaving us\nwith a varied and more unusual piece\nthan what the rest of the album seems\nto offer.\nThe album is rounded off beautifully\nwith \u2018Things\u2019, a slightly chilled out reprise however this track is not for listening to on a bad day (think Counting\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nI\nt was once sung, \u201cJust \u2018cause she\ndances loco, that don\u2019t make\nher a \u2018ho no.\u201d If you can get in\ntouch with me and say which\nsong this is from and the artist\u2019s\nname, then you could win the chance\nto write a column for this here music\nsection- An opportunity not to be\nmissed, you\u2019ve got to be in it to win\nit, etc.\nAnyway, how you doing? What\u2019s\ngoing down? What are the new, cool\njams? Well, I\u2019ve been busy presiding\nover the CDs within Felix\u2019s treasure\nchest of music and hideous artwork.\nThis week I decided to root through\nand found an affront on humanity\nin the form of Neurosonic\u2019s \u201cDrama\nQueen\u201d; which not only instills a hatred reminiscent of that at the Nuremburg Rally in me, but also manages to\nusurp common sense and have Rush\nas a key influence. The latter is such a\nfaux-pas, I equate it to meeting your\ngirlfriend\u2019s parents for the first time,\ndoing doggy-doggy with her mother\nand then at breakfast the next day say\nto the father, \u201cHas your wife ever considered vaginal rejuvenation surgery\nas her munch is like a french-kissing\ncocker spaniel?\u201d Anyway, enough of\nthe small pleasantries, I shall move on.\nWe have had an enthusiastic new\ninflux into the Music Felix community\nand thus we have three album reviews\nfor your delectation. We always want\nas many contributors as possible and\ndon\u2019t let the styles of music currently\nin the pages put you off, we want\npeople with all tastes to write for us -that way it\u2019ll be interesting. I, myself,\nwould love to hear about things I\u2019ve\nnever heard of before and find it more\ninteresting than reading about a band\nI\u2019ve heard of.\nIn case you\u2019re interested in how this\nsection works, I\u2019ll explain: you get in\ntouch either through e-mail (see at the\ntop) or from signing up to our mailing\nlist and we will let you know when we\nhave our meetings. At these meetings\nthere will be free CDs for you to pick\nup and take away to review (you can\nkeep them but if you feel that someone else should review them then\nbring them back). Through our mailing list we will also inform you of gigs\nthat you can get into for free (usually\nwith a \u2018plus one\u2019) if you would want to\ngo and review them. Do not feel guilty\nabout taking things for free, the promotional companies offer them and\nin the future I will talk about these\nelements of the music business.\nFor now, I will have a quick chat\nabout the Radiohead album as the\nmainstream media was overtaken by\ntheir \u2018revolutionary\u2019 approach to their\nnew album. You may well know that\nthey made their album available online\nwith an honesty box where you choose\nwhat you want to pay for the album.\nThis approach, in my mind, does not\nseem revolutionary but necessary. You\ncan draw an analogy with museums,\nsuch that Radiohead are like the Natural History Museum; established and\nnever without an audience, yet you\nmay donate depending on your guilt.\nLet us hope this continues.\nCrows- \u2018Colourblind\u2019).\nIf you\u2019re open minded and like to\ndabble in a bit of indie, this album\ncould well be what your CD collection\nhas been waiting for. Die hard rock\nand R&B fans should stand well back,\nwithout even touching the bunny clad\nalbum cover I can tell you that this al-bum, for you at least, is not going to be\na pleaser.\nRuth Patchett\nThrice\nThe Alchemy Index (Vagrant)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nAlbum Review\nBuen Chico\nRight to Re-Arrange\n(Faith&Hope)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nAlbum Review\nI\u2019ve never heard of them, you\u2019ve never\nheard of them, they probably won\u2019t be\nparticularly famous, but this Double\nA-side single by The Ragga Twins &\nCrew, \u2018Maximum Bass and R.T.C\u2019, is\npropa eavy ting.

The Ragga Twins\nchanged all of this when they turned\nthe bass to \u2018maximum\u2019.\nIt\u2019s really got everything this one.\nThe drums are fast, the base is wobbly\nand repetitive, and the Ragga Twins are\npissed off. I would love to quote some\nlyrics as I\u2019m sure they are hilarious, but\nI can\u2019t understand a word of what is\nbeing said. Honestly though, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter \u2013 the hoarse, raspy flows and\nJamaican intonation fit in perfectly\nwith the style of the tune, so even if it\nwas crystal clear, no one would listen.\nThe train of thought is continued on\nthe AA-side with \u2018R.T.C. (Ragga Twins\nCrew)\u2019, except this time the original\ntwins (Deman Rocker and Flinty Badman) have some company, with four\nother guest MCs. As with the A-side\nthough, the lyrics are unintelligible,\nand the effect of all the guests is mini-mal. Maybe they all have their own distinctive styles, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not really important anyway. \u2018R.T.C.\u2019 could be\ndescribed as an anti-tune, designed to\nbe as harsh to the ear as possible. More\nemphasis is put on bewildering sound\neffects (both telephone and ambulance\nare utilised) than any kind of melody,\nbut rather than being messy and confusing to listen to, it\u2019s structure comes\nfrom it\u2019s chaotic lack of structure.\nAs I said, there is nothing unexpected about these two tracks, but that is\nexactly what makes them so excellent \u2013\nthey conform to the idea that everyone\nhas in their head when they think of\nwhat bass-heavy drum\u2019n\u2019bass is. From\nsongs like this, I don\u2019t want innovation\nor inspiration, I don\u2019t want deep lyrics\nwhich offer me advice about love or\nlife, I just want to turn up the volume\nand have my eardrums fucked up. Job\ndone.\nPeter Sinclair\nTop: Buen Chico, bottom: Thrice\n\n"

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 19 October 2007 felix\nNews\nFollowing a theft incident in Aero, Felix decided to carry out an investigation into the department\u2019s security\nComputer parts were stolen from the\nDepartment of Aeronautics late last\nweek, throwing doubt upon the efficacy of College\u2019s newly installed security\nmeasures.\nThe components of a computer in\nan Aero lecture theatre were probably taken on Thursday afternoon.\nThe computer was part of the lecture\ntheatre control suite and was encased\nin a secure cabinet, to which the thief\nmanaged to gain access. Reports are\nconflicting over precisely when the incident occurred, and what parts were\nstolen, with the Aeronautics Department stating that the CPU and memory were missing, whereas the College\nHead of Security is quoted as saying\nthat only the hard drive was taken.\nThe incident is the latest in a string\nof, allegedly linked, thefts from all over\ncampus during the summer closure\nperiod. After working with police, the\nCollege Security department say that\na suspect has been charged over the\nAero incident, and that they are \u201cvery\nconfident\u201d that they will also be linked\nto the other thefts over the summer.\nThese incidents come after College\nhas spent most of the summer installing new security systems in the many\nentrances around campus, replacing\nthe old system of manning the doors\nwith staff that College Security claims\nwere: \u201creceptionists, not security officers,\u201d even though many of the desks\nwere emblazoned with the title \u201cSecurity Reception\u201d above them. Replacement \u201cReception\u201d signs are due to be\nfitted in the coming weeks.\nThe new system of RFID, Swipe accessible doors and turnstiles have\ncaused controversy across the College,\nwith many students and staff believing\nthat money is being wasted on ineffective and pointless systems, preferring\nthe old system based around departmental \u201cporters.\u201d\nTo investigate these claims, Felix\ncarried out an experiment into accessing the Aeronautics Department from\nthe entrance on Prince Consort Road,\nwhich requires the defeat of several security systems: the external doors, the\ninternal turnstile/gate, and the security\ncamera that monitors both of these.\nOur reporter and photographer encountered no difficulty in \u201ctailgating\u201d\na legitimate student through the first\nset of automatic doors, and then again\nthrough the internal gate, which is\ndesigned for wheelchair use although\nmost students seem to use is instead of\nthe turnstiles to the side. According to\npreviously quoted security sources, an\nalarm is supposed to alert the Security\nOffice in Sherfield when more than\none person walks through this gate.\nUnsatisfied by this challenge, our\nreporter then attempted to breach\nthe turnstiles and gate in a number of\nways, in direct view of the CCTV cam-era, until confronted by the inevitable\nresponse from Security (see front page\nmontage). After waiting for 10 minutes\nwithout being accosted, our reporter\nproceeded to climb two floors up to\na lecture theatre adjacent to the room\nthat was the recent victim of theft, and\nreturn to the ground floor with a prop\nto alert the CCTV camera that he was\ndefinitely up to no good. After borrowing a laptop from a willing student\n(to avoid actually being prosecuted for\nstealing equipment that was actually\nCollege Property, although there was\nmuch equipment ripe for such theft,\nsuch as plasma screens and a set of\nroom keys left lying on a trolley), he\nthen returned to the entrance and,\nstraddling the gate, held his \u2018ill-gotten\u2019\nlaptop aloft.\nIt was at this point that he noticed\nthat the external doors had not closed\nafter the last student swiped, and had\nbeen stuck open for over half an hour.\nEscape from the scene of the crime was\nassured.\nIn perfect timing, at this point a\ndelivery-person walked through the\nopen entrance, and after examining the\nnow-empty \u201creception desk,\u201d asked our\nreporter for directions to an address in\nHuxley: completely unaware that he\nhad inadvertently broken through the\nfirst line of security.\nAn hour after first breaking in to\nAero entrance, and after 45 minutes\nof the external security door being apparently stuck open, our investigative\nteam tired of waiting and returned,\nwithout hinderance, to the Felix offic-es. The only Aeronautics student that\nwas even slightly curious about our activities simply commented on the security systems, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re crap.\nI haven\u2019t had my swipe card for weeks\nand I have no trouble getting in.\u201d\nAfter being contacted by Felix for\nAndrew Somerville\n& Tom Roberts\nTop: the sign currently above the receptionist\u2019s booth in the Blackett\nLaboratory. Bottom: A \u201ccriminal\u201d shows off his newly obtained wares\ncomment on this story, Ceri Davies,\nthe Head of Security in College stated\nthat the new security measures were\nmeant as a \u201cdeterrent.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not designed to be Fort\nKnox or a \u2018Ring of Steel\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nabout trying to get the balance right\nbetween security and freedom of ac-cess. No alarm is supposed to sound\nwhen the turnstiles are hopped-over\n[although he was quoted by Live! (live.\ncgcu.net) in August 2006 as saying that\nthere is \u2013 Editor], criminals aren\u2019t going to jump over, they try to blend in.\u201d\nWhether secure or not, the leading\nopinion, amongst both students and\nstaff, appears to be against the new\nmeasures. Many feel that replacing the\nold, multi-functional, \u201creceptionists\u201d\nwith expensive steel deterrents is a\nwaste of money, and find the new systems \u201cannoying,\u201d and a waste of time\nfor staff, causing headaches for deliveries and visitors.\nThe scene of the crime: the innards of a PC in the Aeronautical department were stolen, possibly, last week\nA delivery man unknowingly breaks into Aero. Luckily, Felix is at hand to point him in the right direction\nSoaring through the Aero turnstiles\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n8 felix Friday 19 October 2007\nPolitics\nPolitics Editor \u2013 Li-Teck Lau\nA modern Russian monarch\nFear is growing that Russia is slipping back into Soviet style autocratic politics\nKadhim Shubber\nThe current President of Russia\nVladimir Putin, is likely to become\nPrime Minister when he steps down\nnext year. How is it that this statement,\nthat would appear to be nonsensical,\nwill soon become reality? The answer\nis linked to the actions of this man; it is\nthe deterioration of democracy in Russia. It would be too alarmist for me to\ntry and imply that Soviet tanks are going to be rolling across Eastern Europe\nnext Summer but certainly there is\ncause for concern about the increasing\ndisregard for human rights in Russia\nand the growing authoritarian nature\nof its government.\nNGO\u2019s in Russia have faced tighter\nand tighter restrictions that hamper\ntheir ability to promote democracy and\nfreedom within civil society as well as\ncarry out the charitable work that is so\nnecessary in Russia. Recent changes to\nthe law \u2018On Public Associations\u2019 allow\nthe federal government the power to\nseverely disrupt the activities and reduce the independence of civil society\nfrom government. This is only part of\nthe authoritative nature of government\nthat President Putin has reintroduced\ninto Russia. He has consistently rolled\nback democratic reforms and tightened state control. The Russian Parliament, the Duma, is filled with Putin\u2019s\nsupporters and has become little more\nthan a rubber stamp, while the media\nhas been intimidated and put under\ngovernment control. This April, Russian police raided the Educated Media\nFoundation, a NGO sponsored by US\nand European donors. The police carried away documents and computers\nthat were used as servers for the Web\nsites of similar groups. That brought\ndown a Web site run by the Glasnost\nDefense Foundation, a media rights\ngroup, which published bulletins on\nviolations of press freedoms. \u201cRussia is\ndropping off the list of countries that\nrespect press freedoms,\u201d said Boris\nTimoshenko, a spokesman for the\nfoundation. \u201cWe have propaganda, not\ninformation.\u201d\nHowever it is not only within Russia\nthat the Kremlin has used undemocratic and oppressive tactics to ensure its preeminence. The conflict in\nChechnya was the Russian equivalent\nof the Iraq war but without the media\nattention due to the monopoly on information that the Russian Army imposed on the area. Unfortunately one\nof the people to report independently\non the conflict Anna Politkovskaya was\nkilled last year. While the steady drum-beat of daily atrocities has ceased, human rights abuses continue unabated.\nA sign of the times is that the current\nKremlin appointed President, Ramzan Kadyrov or \u201cKing Ramzan\u201d, counts\namongst his acquaintances Mike Tyson and keeps a pet lion. More worry-ingly Russian control in Chechnya has\nresulted in systematic torture of de-tainees. \u201cIf you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk\nof torture,\u201d said Holly Cartner, Europe\nand Central Asia director at Human\nRights Watch.\nOn the international stage Russia\u2019s\nactions have become increasingly belligerent and irresponsible. The prominent poisonings of Viktor Yushchenko,\nthe President of Ukraine and Alexander Litvinenko in London were linked\nback to Moscow, some would say quite\ncredibly. While these actions remain\nfor the mean time at least, in the land\nof speculation, in other areas Russia\nhas been throwing its weight around\nvery publicly. It has used its economic\npower i.e. its gas reserves, to bully and\nforce neighbouring countries to succumb to its will. When the Ukranian\nPresidential elections failed to elect a\npro-Russian leader, the state run gas\ncompany Gazprom decided to dramatically raise gas prices. President Putin,\nemboldened by the perceived weakness of Britain and the US as well as\neconomic strength at home, has begun\nto reassert Russia\u2019s influence on the\nworld stage. One gets the feeling that\nPutin is attempting to regain Russia\u2019s\n\u201crightful place amongst the nations of\nthe world\u201d. However this \u201crightful place\namong nations\u201d mentality has been\nshown to be dangerous in the past and\nwill only create trouble in the future.\nCertainly I have painted a grim picture of the Russian Federation but it\nwould seem at the moment that it will\nnot improve in the near future. President Putin seems in no mood to relinquish power, and it is unlikely that he\nwill reverse any of the authoritarian\nmeasures that was introduced over the\nlast 10 years. In addition the UK and\nindeed the US have little credibility to\nadvise Russia on human rights or de-mocracy. Due to our dependance on\nnatural gas and oil, and our involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq we certainly lack the military, political and\neconomicclouttoinfluencePutin.Civil\nindependence is being rapidly eroded\nas the Russian Government or at least\nparts of it act with impunity, for example in the killing of Anna Politkovskaya\nand as long as the Kremlin sponsors\ndictatorial regimes such as in Myanmar it is likely that the efforts of other\npeople around the world to gain civil\nindependence will fail. One might have\nhoped that with the ending of Putin\u2019s\nPresidential term, there may have been\na change in Russian policies, however\nwith Vladimir Putin and his cronies\nfirmly entrenched in the Kremlin and\nthe continuing impotence of the West\nto convincingly stand up as Leader of\nthe Free World, there is unlikely to be a\nlight at the end of the tunnel.\nVladirmir Putin, president of the Russian Federation, will see his term end later this year\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\nIt may be the least read section in Felix, but the politics page returns! The\nstudents aren\u2019t to blame for Imperial\nbeing full of social hermits, rather the\ngovernment. So peel yourselves away\nfrom your Warhammer figurine painting and immerse yourself in current\naffairs, if not for the betterment of so-ciety, then to become a more rounded\nand therefore more beautiful person.\nThe holidays have been an active one.\nThere were angry monks in Myanmar,\na change of Prime Minister in the UK\nand a credit crunch all over the world.\nIn the meantime, a US Navy shake-up\nin the Pacific will position the fleet to\nstrike at Iran more effectively, Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin\u2019s supporters harangued the British embassy for\nportraying their benevolent leader un-satisfactorily, Israel still refuses to acknowledge the democratically elected\nHamas party but has agreed to talks\nfor a two state solution, Dafur violence\nhas leaked into neighbouring Chad, Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lost\nthe lower house and then checked into\nhospital, Oxfam has estimated that aid\nto Africa over the past decade roughly\nequals that spent on wars in that, the\nworld\u2019s poorest, continent and more\nrecently, ex US president Jimmy Carter\ncalled Dick Cheney a \u2018disaster\u2019.\nElections are springing up all over the\nworld like a democratic rash. Australia\nis heading for a poll in mid November\nwhich is likely to see conservative incumbent John Howard replaced in office after 11 years by Labour\u2019s Kevin\nRudd. Despite a lead of over 10 points,\nour Ozzy friends have an historic dislike of governmental change, so a last\nminute swing remains a possibility.\nRussia would theoretically have a new\nleader come Christmas due to constitutional restrictions on the number of\nterms the president can hold, but is becoming increasingly unlikely as Mr Putin manoeuvres to increase the powers\nof Prime Minister and move into that\noffice after elections. The highly popular leader will most probably not actually physically move office though.\nAnd of course, Hillary Clinton continues her unrelenting quest for the\nAmerican presidency which will be\ndecided in late 2008. She has been\nraising more money than any other\ncandidate, including most poignantly,\nBarrack Obama who was until last\nmonth, leading in said field. Many in\nthe US, however, just can\u2019t get past her\nun-Catholic behaviour, \u2018win whatever\nthe costs\u2019 attitude and distinctly sterile\npersonality.\nMore locally, Gordon Brown decided\nagainst any prospect of an election until 2009, prompting Sir Ming Campbell\nof the Liberal Democrats to resign this\nweek. The LibDems have slumped as\nlow as single figures in some polls due\nto resurgent support for the two dominant parties in UK politics.\nFinally, the UN Security Council will\nwelcome a change of guard in 2008\nwhen 5 non permanent seats are renewed at the end of this year. The new\nmember states, who were confirmed\nearlier in the week, are Libya, Vietnam,\nBurkina Faso, Croatia and Costa Rica.\nThey, though. have no power of veto.\nA shelled out building in Grozny, capital of the troubled Russain state of Chechnya\n\n"

And\nwhat better title to bring into the limelight than one of the most interesting\nJapanese Role-Playing Games released\nthis year sans Final Fantasy moniker.\nThe rather difficult to pronouce Shin\nMegami Tensei: Persona 3 is the featured game and I have a feeling that\nit personifies pretty much everything\nthat he probably dislikes in his breakfast J-RPGs. Office politics follow suit.\nThis week\u2019s buzzword? Irreverence.\nThis\nWeek\nAre licensed games sith? Persona 3\nFlame(shield) On! Sphere\nAlert: Official Merchandise\nAzfarul Islam plays with fire and realises that the burnt hand doesn\u2019t teach best\nDied soon after EA announce The\nGodfather game. Coincidence?\nAh, there\u2019s nothing more majestic than the sight of a giant ape roaring in the throes of a massive diarrhoea attack\nMarlan Brando\nFun yet incredibly frustrating\nHarry Potter\nBut there\u2019s still hope...\nGandalf the White\nH\now is it that despite the\nsheer overindulgent\nquality of some games,\nthey are unceremoniously ousted from their\nroost at the numero uno spot because\nthe words \u2018Harry\u2019 and \u2018Potter\u2019 decided\nto juxtapose themselves on the jewel\ncase?\nQuite frankly, it\u2019s you lot to blame.\nNo, not you in general. I\u2019m talking\nabout the person who\u2019s wearing a\nGryffindor scarf as the weather turns\nunpleasant. I\u2019m talking about the person whose fully articulated Optimus\nPrime sits next to his or her screen,\ntaking precedence over an increasingly\ndusty pile of textbooks. Okay, fine I\u2019m\nalso talking about the casual fan as\nwell. I\u2019m equally at blame here.\nYes I know that the Order of the\nPhoenix for the PS2 has an average\nMetascore of 61. Like most discerning\ngamers, I do do a fairly comprehensive\nbit of research when it comes to grudgingly parting with my pound sterling\nnotes. Yet, I found out the score for this\ngame after buying it and I couldn\u2019t care\nless. Why is that?\nIt\u2019s just a very depressing fact that\nfranchises sell. Not to make it sound\nlike it\u2019s a bad thing, but in our little\nworld of videogames, it often is. That\u2019s\nthe whole point of the interactive medium \u2013 to let us get that much closer to\nworlds, to wrought changes upon them\nor at the very least, furtively glancing\naround before gleefully blurting out\n\u201cwingardium leviosa\u201d because hey, I\njust made something float all by my-self. As with any relatively well-known\nfranchise, we have a legion (understate-ment, naturally) of fans who are wont\nto gobble up all related paraphernalia.\nThe case has existed for years with\nplastic toys being the most popular\navenue of aficionado investment. That\nhas given way in recent years towards\nvideogames. With ever-burgeoning attach rate of home consoles, even the\nnon-gamer finds himself or herself\ndrawn to yet another form of his or\nher object of adulation. Every recent\nfilm adaptation and even some classics are to be blamed of having their\nudders tweaked for golden globules of\nvideogame-centric income. Eric Cantona\u2019s quote falls well in context here:\n\u201cWhen the seagulls follow the trawler,\nit\u2019s because they\nthink sardines\nwill be thrown in\nto the sea\u201d. Fans\nare inexorably\ndrawn, regardless\nof rationality.\nAnd somewhere\nalong the way, developers caught\nthe scent of the\nfurtive fan. They\nknew at that moment that beyond\nany original gaming IP they could\never dream of\n\u2013 be it the Marios and Half-Lifes\n(Half-Lives?) \u2013\nnothing could tally\nthe revenue like\na communally established franchise.\nQuality was no longer the issue here. A\nrudimentary game is blas\u00e9 to the gaming populace, but the same game with\na Big Name\u2122 attached to it was a proverbial batch of hotcakes. The key in-gredient: presentation. The more such\na piece of interactive merchandise can\ndraw the fan into their world of choice,\nthe better it is perceived as a \u2018quality\u2019\nproduct. Once such groundwork was\nestablished as a basic blueprint, the\ngames started pouring in. Significant\nsums of money are paid to obtain the\nlicenses but such costs are all too easily\noffset by the unusually large revenue\nper unit values of videogames.\nGames of this ilk are established\nwith fantastic touches mainly based on\ncountenance. Film tie-ins boast direct\nfootage that one might have to wait\nweeks to see. Celebrity voice-overs, art\nassets, collectible extras and the general atmosphere of polish all add gravi-tas to the purchase. Sometimes the\nadditions of entirely new scenarios or\nassets (like characters and locales) endemic to the gaming iteration are major\ndraws. Basically, these are all cosmetic\ncommodities. It makes a fan\u2019s heart feel\nall warm and fuzzy... until the first cutscene stops and you start playing. More\noften than not,\nthe same level of\nquality refuses\nto permeate into\nwhat really matters for a videog-ame: the gaming\nportion. Poor\ndesign, mundane objectives,\ntechnical issues,\ncamera problems\nand other flaws\nseverely detract\nfrom an otherwise stunningly attractive package.\nWhile I\u2019m sure\nthe teams behind\nit have worked\nhard at getting all\nthat coding onto\nyour disc, it\u2019s clear that a certain level\nof conviction was still lacking. Deep\nin their hearts they know that this is\nthe kind of thing that\u2019ll have their paychecks signed even if they decided to\nskimp here, there and sometimes, eve-rywhere. It seems quite stereotypical\nto bring this to light, but that\u2019s truly\nthe case.\nWhile this seems a little archaic in\nthe light of an upswing in the quality of\nvideogames based on films and what-have-you, there\u2019s compelling evidence\nthat such a rise was more sporadic\nthan a genuine upheaval. Despite that,\nthere are still quality titles that cater to\nboth the obsessive need to collect and\nthe gamer within. The Lord of the Rings\ntitles are surprisingly competent and\nfun games, while King Kong was a great\nmelange of cinematic presentation and\nfairly fresh gameplay. The Chronicles of\nRiddick, while not a direct tie-in, was\na fantastic game by its own right. Star\nWars games have a more capricious\nhistory of quality ranging from pure\nguilty pleasures to utter detritus. The\nlist of these not-crap titles can be deceptively (although, not significantly)\nlong when considered subjectively.\nDespite the average game buyer,\nhardcore or otherwise, being more\nconsumer savvy, such titles are designed to be an arrow to the Achilles\u2019\nheel really. You can be as self-aware of\nthe problems as much as you want but\nat the end of the day, you will end up\nwalking away with a copy of Superman\nReturns while the gods of commonsense hurl curses and idioms at you.\n\n"

A paper by Geoffrey Miller et al. from the\nUniversity of New Mexico in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour,\nshows that strippers working while in\nthe most fertile phase of the menstrual\ncycle, the oestrus phase, made an impressive $70 an hour. In the less fertile\nluteal phase they made $50 and when\nthey were menstruating, they made\n$35. Those on the pill made on average\nless because there was no peak in their\nearnings at the oestrus phase.\nOestrus is a state of obvious fertility\nthat attracts potential mates. Accepted\nwisdom is that it was lost as humans\nevolved. Women developed \u201cconcealed\novulation\u201d along with month-long\nsexual receptivity to keep men in the\ndark. This study, however, shows that a\nwomen\u2019s fertile state may not be so secret after all \u2013 at least according to the\nresults from the eighteen strippers who\ntook part. The authors think that men\ncan tell a woman\u2019s fertility by subconscious behavioural signals, after having\nruled out factors like types of dance\nmoves or conversational content.\nKarl Grammer of the Ludwig Boltzman Institute for Urban Ethology in\nVienna agrees. He thinks that oestro-gen modulates motion abilities and so\nit is body motion, not pheromones,\nwhich tells men what is going on. So,\nwomen may have developed stealthy\noestrus, but their sexy walk still gives\nthem away. Definitely useful if you\u2019re\non the pull on a night out.\nHowever, this paper raises a few\nquestions. Firstly, in my limited (read:\nnonexistent) experience of strip clubs,\nI can\u2019t imagine much \u2018conversation\u2019 going on, over and above the basics such\nas \u201chow much, love?\u201d Secondly, how\non earth did this project get funding?\nI personally would love to read the research proposal, just to giggle and read\nbetween the lines. And thirdly, the paper was written by three men. I wonder\nwhy\u2026\nIntrepid researchers discover lap-dancers earn more when\nthey\u2019re ovulating. One could say they\u2019re golden eggs then...\nCatherine Charter\nDebate on science\nand the media\nAnyone interested in the occasionally rocky relationship between scientists and the media should pencil in\na Thursday a couple of weeks hence,\nas it heralds a debate, part of the series of events celebrating Imperial\u2019s\nCentenary.\nEntitled \u201cA marriage made in heaven or hell? Do scientists and the\nmedia make good bedfellows?\u201d, this\ndebate assembles a number of Imperial\nacademics and journalists to discuss\nwhether the media help or hinder sci-entists, looking at their role in issues\nof concern, including the hyping of\nfindings, pandering to \u201cmad scientist\u201d\nstereotypes and whether important\ndiscoveries are being overlooked in a\nquest for sexy or controversial science.\n[Maybe, but given our own track record\n(eyes left), we certainly won\u2019t cast any\nstones on the latter point \u2013 Ed.]\nIn the scientist corner are Professors\nSteve Bloom and Richard Templer,\nboth battle-hardened veterans of the\nfray, thanks to experience representing their fields (obesity and biofuels re-spectively) under the spotlight. Meanwhile, the media are represented by a\nnumber of Imperial alumni (many of\nwhom cut their teeth here at Felix and\nIC Radio) including Pallab Ghosh, the\nScience Correspondent for BBC News\nand erstwhile Felix Editor (1983-84).\nGiven all this, it should be a lively\ndiscussion, and Felix Science recommends you go \u2013 we certainly will be.\nMagnetic storage past and future: Nobel Prizes and ferrotoroidicity\nThis year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics went\nto a pair of scientists whose discovery\ncould be argued to have had the largest\nimpact on society, exceeding last year\u2019s\naward for the discovery of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background radiation (the\nsignature of the Big Bang) say.\nBecause after all, we\u2019re a bunch of\nphilistines really. Addressing where we\ncame from is all very well, but what we\nreally care about is our choons. \u201cI want\nmy MTV\u201d runs far deeper in the human psyche than \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d\nAlbert Fert and Peter Gr\u00fcnberg may\nnot have set out to revolutionise the\nmusic industry (and indeed the wider\nmarket of consumer electronics); in\nfact, as pointed out in last week\u2019s Nature, it was Stuart Parkin at IBM who\nperformed the work crucial to the\ncommercialisation of their discovery\nand the ensuing sea-change in the way\nwe listen to our music.\nBut it was the continental scientists\u2019\ndiscovery of giant magnetoresistance,\na phenomenon which lies at the heart\nof modern magnetic storage devices\n(such as an iPod\u2019s hard-drive). which\nwas recognised by the Royal Swedish\nAcademy of Sciences on the 9th of this\nmonth.\nIn essence, their discovery relies on\nelectron spin, a property which can be\noriented in one of two senses (\u201cup\u201d or\n\u201cdown\u201d), and which leads to an intrinsic\nmagnetic field and an interaction of the\nelectron with external fields. If an electron passing through a material has a\nspin aligned with those of the electrons\nwithin the material, it will encounter a\nfar lesser resistance than if its spin is\noriented in the opposite sense.\nBy using multiple layers of very thin\nmagnetic and non-magnetic materi-als, Fert and Gr\u00fcnberg independently\nmanaged to scale this effect up, to lead\nto a very large change in resistance.\nOne consequence of this increase in\nsensitivity to small magnetic fields is\nthat it allowed hard disc drive heads to\nbe made far smaller. It also opened the\ndoor to what is widely hailed as the fu-Edmund Henley\nThe editor cannot recommend\ntracking down the original paper\nhighly enough \u2013 the background\nsection \u201cbecause academics\nmay be unfamiliar with the\ngentlemen\u2019s club subculture\u201d is\nmost interesting.

Amongst other effects,\nimprovements in spintronics could\nlead to great advances in computing.\nHowever, other technologies could\npotentially also lead to similarly far-reaching effects. Ferrotoroidicity is\none such claimant to the throne. In a\nletter to Nature last week, scientists\nfrom the University of Bonn reported\nthat they were able to use laser-optics\nto measure the sense of \u201cmagnetic vortices\u201d in a substance known as lithium\ncobalt phosphate.\nThese vortices, which are composed\nof magnetised atoms, are arranged in\na ring-like configuration, the atoms all\naligning themselves in one direction\nalong the ring. As this orientation is binary (it can take on one of two senses),\na vortex can also potentially be used\nto store information, probably faster\nand more reliably than on today\u2019s hard\ndiscs, as it neatly avoids using magnetic fields to read the stored magnetic\ndata \u2013 a slow and delicate task.\nMuch work is still required, but it\ncould be that the ring-like signature\nClickWheel on the iPod is rather pre-scient.
