    "content": "David Jones takes a personal look at this year's Edinburgh\nFringe and reviews Imperial College's Beit Theatre plays.\nToo many years of watching Dramsoc\nproductions have made it difficult to\nsit through any of their shows without\nwatching the cast instead of their\ncharacters. This was the chief reason\nwhy I did not enjoy Bent, Beit\nTheatre's most successful play of the\n1987 Fringe, as much as most\nmembers of the large audience which\nsaw it with me.\nThough it is difficult to judge their\nperformances objectively, it did seem\nthat the two leading players had\n\u2022\ntheatre modelled their characters too closely\nupon themselves. This was an easy\nconclusion to reach, however,\nbecause both Andy Meeson (Horst)\nand Simon Lewis (Max) suited their\nroles very well. In fact the play was\nvery well cast all round, and it says\na lot that, far from there being any\nactors who were only along for the\nride, some of the most impressive\nperformances were given by the\nsupporting characters.\nBent, by Martin Sherman, is a sensitive play about the persecution\nof homosexuals in pre-war Nazi\nGermany. When the leaders of the SA\nare executed, Germany' s homosexuals lose their only ally in a position of power. The central\ncharacter, Max, and his lover spend\ntwo years on the run from the Nazis,\nbut are captured and sent to Dachau.\nOnly Max survives the journey to the\nconcentration camp.\nThe second half of the play is an\naccount of the relationship between\nMax and Horst, another homosexual\nprisoner. Consigned to continually\nmove stones, and even though they\nare not allowed to touch or even be\nseen to converse, the two men\ndevelop a deep love for one another.\nThe camp guards are always a fearsome presence, but really the play\nis more like a classical love story\nwhere the lovers are prevented from\nbeing together; that they are\nhomosexuals in a concentration camp\nis secondary.\nThe play was co directed by the two\nleading actors. Directing from the\nfloor is a tough prospect, and can be\ndetrimental to the other actors. On this occasion there was no hint of this.\nMark Taylor arguably stole the show\nwith his portrayals of the effeminate\nRudy, and the truly gruesome captain\nat Dachau. I particularly liked Mike\nStone's drag act as Greta, owner of\na Berlin nightclub. Ciaran Hassett is\nnot used to playing old queens, but\nhis performance as Max's uncle was\none of the most natural and\naccomplished.\nNazi Germany is not a new setting\nfor the theatre, and homosexuality is\nnot a new subject, but the play has a warmth and a gentle humour which\nset it aside from less sensitive pieces.\nIf you get a chance to see this play\ndon't let it pass.\n5\nER HRP E EDWARD UBEE\n' ' A game of two halves'' would have\nbeen David Coleman's comment if he\nhad been in Edinburgh this August to\nsee Beit Theatre perform Edward\nAlbee's Seascape. (Apologies to\nPrivate Eye readers). This is one of\nthose plays where we witness real\nreactions to an unreal situation. An elderly couple are spending a day at\nthe seaside, reminiscing and arguing.\nAfter forty minutes of dialogue which\nis fairly undemanding on the\naudience, two green reptiles appear\nfrom the sea to confront the 'ordinary'\nhumans.\nPerhaps this play is best appreciated\na short time after seeing it, when the\none-paced first half can be considered\nin relation to the much snappier\nsecond half. To develop a discussion\nof how mankind sees itself, of how\nour perception of our own 'supreme'\nintelligence should be questioned, a rather bizarre situation is required. I do not pretend that took in everything\nthe author intended, but I did enjoy\nthe production and will be making\nefforts to see more of Albee's work.\nOverall the cast of four did\nexceptionally well with a difficult\nscript. Dramsoc regulars Mike Foulds, Portia Smith and Sam\nDuerden were all on form, and special\nmention must be made of Tom Brandon, a newcomer to ICDS, who\ncoped admirably with the most\ndemanding part. Unlike so many\nstudent amateurs, he has the right\nbuild for a fifty year old (no offence,\nTom).\nThis play was performed with\npractically no set and no props, and\nI could not help thinking, not for the\nfirst time, that this is the best type of\nproduction to take to Dramsoc's Fringe venue. Though the first act\nwas rather static, the second half was\nwell blocked and thoughtfully\ndirected. I look forward to seeing\nmore of the same at next year's Fringe.\n10 Friday October 16th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The Collection The Lover The only Harold Pinter play with\nwhich I am familiar is The Caretaker,\na work which made the author famous\nfor his pauses. The impression sticks,\nso I was pleased that neither The\nCollection nor The Lover, presented\nby Beit Theatre as a double bill,\nturned out to be such heavy going.\nThe Collection is an in trui g ing play.\nThe jealous husband confronts his\nunfaithful wife's young lover, and\ntries to bully him into admitting his\nadultery. The 'lover' and his older\nfriend with whom he lives deny that\nanything has occurred. Early on you\nare inclined to believe the husband,\nbut by the end of the play the sides\nof the argument are delicately\nbalanced; a good point at which to\nfinish.\nThe play hangs on the\npsychological battle between the\nhusband (Ciaran Hasett) and the\nyoung man's mentor, Harry (Walter\nEaves). Both men gave skilful\nperformances and at times showed up\nthe other two members of the cast,\nneither of whom, I felt, had really\nmastered their characters. Walter\nEaves in particular carried off his role\nwith a great deal of panache and was\nclearly comfortable on stage. I am\ninclined to blame lack of direction for\nany failings in the other actors.\nThe Lover is an exercise in roleplaying for two actors. A married\ncouple (Mike Foulds and Tessa\nHoxey) live for part of their day in\na pretend world, where each\nrepresents a different character to the\nother; to the wife the husband is her\nlover and to the husband the wife is\nhis whore. Each fictional character is\na knowledge d and approved of by\nhusband and wife in their normal\nroles. We are not told how long the\ncouple have been indulging in their\ninfidelities. This wie rd arrangement\nis jeo pardi sed by the restless husband,\nwho decides to try and change the\nrules of their game.\nMike Foulds and Tessa Hoxey both\nturned in good performances, but\nagain I thought that the play was\nslightly under-directed. To be fair to\nthe company, though, it is very\ndifficult to make any production look\nconvincing when the actors have to\nnegotiate any amount of set on the\ncramped stage at Theatre West End,\nEdinburgh.\nImpressions\nof\nEdinburgh\nPippa Salmon reveals the\nsecrets of the Edinourgh\nFringe Festival\nWould you like to sleep with fourteen\nother people, stand in the torrential\nrain watching fire words to the strains\nof distant music or rub shoulders with\n'real actors' and Arty People?\nIf you're at all interested, rush to\nbook a ticket to Edinburgh, August\n1988 immediately! Soon you will be\nleaping from the coach/train/car\nsleeping bag in hand and heading for\none of the thousand shows on the\nFringe. Before you know it you will\nbe flicking through the Fringe Guide\nand scanning the Daily Diary like an\nold hand. As you stroll casually into\nthe Fringe Club, you may reflect on\nthe dull London scene, contrasting\nsharply with the amazing theatrical\nperformances you have just\nexperienced. On the other hand, you\nmay just be amazed at the building\n(which is the Edinburgh University\nStudent Union Building)\u2014and\nperhaps wish it would stop raining...\nEach August, IC Dramsoc people\nbecome Fringe People. They pack up\ntheir worldly goods and journey to\nEdinburgh where they build a small\ntheatre from a church hall, some bits\nof wood and string, lots of enthusiasm\nand plenty of skill. It's corny but true.\nMeanwhile, they prepare what are\namong the best non-professional\nshows on the Fringe.\nAs the church hall is at the West\nend of Prince's Street (Edinburgh's main shopping street) the venue is\nknown as Theatre West End, or\nT WE. About three of the T WE productions are put on by Beit\nTheatre, Dramsoc's Edinburgh alter\nego. The other slots are sold to\nprofessional and amateur performers\nand companies. Dramsoc members\nrun the box office and often the lights,\nsound and 'front of house' (ticket\ncollection and ushering) too. The\nwhole venue is the responsibility of\nanother Dramsoc stalwart, the T WE administrator. Each year the\nadministrator heads for Edinburgh a happy-go-lucky person and returns,\nafter a string of nervous breakdowns,\ngrey-haired and shaking. Ask any\nDramsoc person 'Why?' and they are\nlost for words. For most, it's a chance\nto become another person for four\nweeks each year: to master the art of\nbeing Someone rather than someone.\nBut Edinburgh isn't just for those\nwho create: it's for anyone who can't afford the airfare to every capital of\nthe World. It's the only place where\nyou can sample a Russian version of\nHamlet or a Japanese mime or the\nbrilliant Thunderbirds FA B! You can\nstay for a week and watch four plays\na day or for the full three weeks and\nsample maybe one or two a day.\nGo to Edinburgh for the culture, for\nthe atmosphere, for the music\u2014but\ndon't go for the weather!\nFELIX Friday October 16th198711 "

Many of you will be fairly\nexcited about the prospect of living\nin a city that has everything to offer\nas far as enjoyment and 'having a good time' goes and if the central\nlocation of Imperial College is\nanything to go by many of you are in\nfor a very lively time\u2014not only in\nCollege, where I gather the\nEntertainments Committee is very\nactive, but also discovering some\nplaces that appeal to your own style.\nSome people may even find\nthemselves (and their appearance)\nadapting to their environment.\nIt's a good idea, before actually\ncommitting yourself to a whole night\nin one place, to stand outside for a few\nminutes and take a good look at the\npeople who are going in, special\nattention should be paid to who the\nbouncer is actually letting in too\u2014\neither you've got the right look or you\nneed to go straight home and ask\nyourself: \"Would you let you in?\". I'm sure you can appreciate that those\nof you who have just unpacked your\npolka dot puffball skirt and stilettos\nwill not particularly be welcome (or\nfeel comfortable) at a club or bar\nwhere everyone is dressed in black\nand Doc Martins or vice-versa.\nDue to the fact that, generally\nspeaking, club prices are rather\nexcessive it's only common sense to\ngo and have a few drinks beforehand\n(damned good excuse anyway!). I can\nrecommend the following bars if\nyou're looking for a good start to the\nevening\u2014don't overdo it though, it\ndoesn't give a very good impression\nif you fall arse-over-filo fax onto the\ndancefloor of Stringfellows (where?):\nThe Dome (King's Road), relaxed\nand very continental (can get crowded\nat weekends), you can grab some food\nand if you find yourself wandering\naround Chelsea in a drunken state first\nthing in the morning they'll serve you\nbreakfast as well. Freud's( Shaftesbury Avenue), this place will\nsell you coffee (but that's just a little\nbit too cool), it will also sell you\nPolish Budweiser in half-litre bottles,\nit is situated in a basement underneath\na custom-furniture shop (worth a look) and the influence of the shop is\nreflected downstairs by the slabs of\nconcrete used as tables (this is real\nlow-tech). The bar downstairs in the\nKings Head (Gerrard Street, Soho),\nis predominantly full of gay men\nduring the week but on Friday and\nSaturday nights the atmosphere is\ngenerally pretty straight (ie not gay),\nsmoke-filled and loud. If you find\nyourself in Covent Garden the Punch\n& Judy and Rumours are good\nbully-off points and at Palookavilles\nyou might catch some free jazz\nrelatively tourist-free.\nRight then, time for a quick look\nat some of the clubs in London worth\na visit, and some worth avoiding!\nE= East London\nW= West London\nWE=West End\nN= North London\nS= South London (yeh!)\nBass Clef (Hoxton, E) \u2014Catch some\njazz, salsa and African dance music.\nThe emphasis is on getting hot and\ntrying to forget how bad their house\nwine is.\n100 Club (Oxford St, WE) During the week avoid this place unless you\nlike dixieland jazz otherwise a great\nplace to see bands\u2014good bar prices\ntoo.\nDingwalls (Camden Lock, N) \u2014A chance to see your favourite blues\nsinger in fact Eric Clapton did just\nthat a couple of weeks ago.\nWag Club (Wardour St,. WE) \u2014\nYoung crowd who obviously don't mind queueing\u2014they think they're\ntrendy, anyway.\nMarquee (Wardour St, WE)\u2014Headbanger's paradise in recent years.\nFridge (Brixton, S) \u2014Don't let the\ninitial body search put you off this\nclub in a converted cinema. The TV screens show a load of crap but they\nmake a good backdrop for the lively\nand mixed crowd.\nHeaven (Waterloo, S) \u2014The crowd\nmight shock you (just a bit) even on\n'straight' nights so go with an open\nmind.\nLe Beat Route (Greek St, WE) \u2014\nSmall, friendly disco atmosphere just\na few too many Italians hugging the\nwalls.\nHippodrome (Leicester Sq, WE) \u2014\nDon't feel you have to go into the\nHippodrome it's a bit big and bloody\nexpensive, it's also more entertaining\nto stand outside and watch people\ntrying to get in.\nLimelight (Shaftesbury Ave, WE) \u2014\nThis club seems to have the very\ncommendable policy of letting a very\nmixed crowd of people in\u2014and that's what counts.\nRock Garden (Covent Garden,\nWE)\u2014Useless venue to see bands,\nbut they pack 'em in anyway.\nRonnie Scotts (Frith St, WE) \u2014\nProbably the best and most well\nknown jazz club in Britain\u2014it's worth\nsplashing out on the odd 'famous old\njazz singer' but also a good place to\nsee younger (and probably more\nlively) bands as well.\nCamden Palace (Camden, N) \u2014The\nPalace, as it's now known, I'm afraid\nhas lost its original fashionable status\nand is now on a par with The Palais\n(formerly Hammersmith Palais), but\nMonday night is 'sixties night' and\neveryone lets themselves go only to\ngrab someone else.\nElectric Ballroom (Camden, N) \u2014\nVariations in the type of music and\npresentation by different DJs offer\nyou something different every night.\nNow a chance to mention some of the\nplaces a little bit further out for\nexample: Zeeta's in Putney is lively\nenough and there's always a cortina\ndriver ready to make a prat of\nhimself, smells like a Berni Inn\nthough! The burning question in\nWimbledon seems to be; is Midnight\nopen again yet? In contrast the\nClarendon Hotel, is incredibly old\nand tatty full stop (.)\nIf as a last resort you find yourself\nqueueing outside The Empire or\nMaximus, Leicester Sq, don't try and\nkid yourself that the complete morons\nhanging around outside aren't really\ngoing in.\nLocally, / think Crazy Larry's in\nthe King's Rd, is awful and 3 rd Street apparently gives you a discount\nand is probably good value.\nFELIX Friday October 16th19879 "

Unusable Room\nDear Judith,\nSome readers of FELIX will by now be aware of the\nserious threat to music at IC posed by the change in usage\nof 52-53, Princes Gate, formerly the Humanities\nDepartment, now the School of Management. Many will\nnot appreciate the potentially devastating effect this may\nhave, some will not even know there has been a change.\nThere is no secret about the intentions of the Rector in\nbringing about this change and in recruiting Professor\nNorburn to run the School of Management. It is seen as\na means of providing substantial income for the College\nand at the beginning of a third term of Conservative\ngovernment one can hardly blame the Rector for seeking\nany means of supplementing the UGC grant. However,\nif it is to be at the cost of College music then I find it\nwholly unacceptable.\nAs a college with no Music Department it has always\nbeen difficult to find adequate facilities for rehearsals and\nconcerts but now it could become almost impossible. In\nthe Music Room we have not just a good facility, we have\na perfect room for all manner of musical activities from\nsolos and recitals to chamber orchestra and chamber choir\nconcerts, which has been the focal point for much of the\nMusical life of the College.\nIts advantages, and the disadvantages of all the proposed\nalternatives, are its superb acoustics, its size, its availability\nand the fact that it has a piano of a reasonable standard.\nI would be delighted to hear from anyone who can name\nme one room in College which combines all of these\nqualities, it is my belief that such a room does not exist.\nAt present we have been granted use of the room for\n3 concerts this term but after Christmas building alterations\nand re decoration will render it unusable. Already we are\nbeing asked to find other places to rehearse. The chances\nof us being able to use it again do not look good unless\nwe can convince the necessary people that this room must\nremain a music room.\nIronically, the College has recently been making a big\npoint of telling prospective students (in a glossy, colour\nbrochure) how good the music at IC is, as indeed it is,\nwith the intention of attracting students keen to take part\nin extra-curricular musical activities. The policy appears\nto have been successful; last year Tony Neal, brass winner\nof the BBC's Young Musician of the Year competition,\ncame to study at IC and this year Geoffrey Silver, leader\nof the National Youth Orchestra has started a Maths\ndegree. I cannot imagine that they are very impressed by\nthe facilities here.\nAlan Downie, Maths PG,\nChairman, Chamber Music Society.\nDamp Squib\nDear Judith,\nThere has been much adverse criticism of the Guilds\nHitsquadding members of the ICU Exec at the Freshers'\nReception on Monday morning. The fl anning has been\ncarried out for the last few years, and it is intended to\npublicise the Hitsquad prior to Rag Week and add some\nlight relief to the Reception. No member of ICU Exec\ncan say that they were surprised when it happened; it's traditional!\nLast year Hitsquad raised over \u00a3600 from 'contracts'\ntaken out at Rag Week and Covent Garden. So please\nunless anyone has any better ideas to raise that much\nmoney let's continue this great traditional event.\nMembers of Guilds who carry out the 'hits' put a great\ndeal of time and effort into organising the 'hits'. The\nvictims are never hurt at all physically unlike the\nHitsquadders who sometimes can get violently attacked\nby 'targets' who seem to lack either a sense of humour\nor charity ie Alan Ego and Charles Takeiteasy who\nappeared to be practising for a wrestling tournament at\nMonday's Reception. (They also get paid \u00a33,300 per\nannum after tax and NI.)\nHitsquad will now be out of action until we can raise\n50 pints of blood. Before then we would be most grateful\nif anyone who wears contact lenses or has ill feeling about\nbeing flan ned comes and leaves their name in the Guilds\nUnion Office and suitable precautions will be taken.\nThere have been questions raised as to whether or not\nthe Guilds Exec did or didn't know about the event before\nhand. It would have been impossible for them to have\nknown due to the fact that the hit was neither thought of\nor organised until half way through the Rector's addressing\nspeech. In other words they had as much knowledge about\nthe event as any person who has been at IC for any period\nof time.\nWe hope this has made the situation a lot clearer for\nall involved or interested.\nYours, with Rag in mind,\nCity & Guilds Hitsquad.\nPS If anyone is interested in donating blood then please\nsign up in the Guilds Office. The Blood Transfusion\nService will be visiting IC on 6th November. Thankyou.\nGrateful thanks\nDear Judith,\nFurther to your article last week concerning the new\nR SMU Office; I feel it would be appropriate to thank one\nor two more people.\nWe are particularly grateful to John Smith (College Sec),\nJohn Archer (Head of MRE Dept), Ted Brown (now\nlecturing Head of Engineering in the University of\nQueensland) and Barry Holt (Departmental\nSuperintendant) for all their help and support.\nYours sincerely,\nGeoff Parsons\nGod help ICU\nDear Judith,\nI have just left the Great Hall after the Freshers' U GM, which is usually the best-attended U GM of the year.\nHowever, today's was not only in quo rate but possibly the\nworst-attended UG MI 've ever been to. I am naturally\ndisappointed about this, as the meeting was advertised in\nthe Freshers' Handbook, in Monday's FELIX, and with\nposters around College. Where were all the Freshers??\nIf today'sU GM attendance means that we've plunged to\nhitherto-unknown depths of apathy with this year's fresher s, then God help IC Union. I only hope that there's an alternative explanation\u2014if anybody knows what it is,\nI'd love to know.\nYours,\nAlastair J Seymour, UGM Chairman.\nL FELIX Friday October 16th198719 "

He\nhad rehearsed the purposeful walk from his chair to the committee room\ndoor and was sure that he was going to look strong and powerful as he\nslammed the door behind him. There was only one problem: although she\nhad been working on nothing else for several days, Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks\nhad not yet finished sowing all the sequins onto his new dress.\nEgo had one last attempt at persuading Whygate to go to the committee\nmeeting. \" You must come to the meeting tonight, Whygate\", he said.\n\"There's no point in having it if you're not there, and all the other important\ncitizens will be arriving soon. We can't cancel it now, it would be wasting\nall the citizens' time\".\n\"There's no alter nti ve\", screamed Whygate, \" we must call off the\nmeeting. I think it's very cruel of you to expect me to go under the\ncircumstances, Ego\". Ego and Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks groaned. It looked as if they had no\nchoice but to cancel the citizens' committee. Ego looked at his watch;\nit was 3 o 'clock and there were only four hours before the meeting was\ndue to begin. He went to get Chas Takeiteasy out of bed so that he could\nprint a notice saying that the citizens' committee was cancelled.\nIn the rest of Cheapskate things were carrying on much the same as\nusual. The Baron's wife, Mad Dash, was very busy, bullying people into\nhelping her with her latest scheme, the Cheapskate Wl. Mad Dash thought\nthat it was a very good thing to have a Wl group for Cheapskate; she\nenjoyed baking cakes, making the tea and listening to talks about stamp\ncollecting, and she was sure that all the other women in Cheapskate would\nenjoy all this too. At the moment she was busy writing a report of the\nfirst Wl meeting for the Baron's new comic, 'WetNerk'. It had been a very\nexciting meeting, but she could not remember what flavour cake John\nSecretary's wife had baked. She thought about this for half an hour, and\nthen decided to say that it had been a 'very nice' cake.\nWhile all these exciting things were taking place, there was a big\nargument going on in the PHALIX office. Willhebe Goodforacolumninch\nhad been dragged out of retirement to take up his old job as editor of the\nfairy stories. Judith Largeamounts, the PHALIX Editor, was very cross\nwith Willhebe for writing a long story about why Whygate was a wonderful\nperson. Whygate had given Willhebe an 'exclusive' on how he had done\nmonths of research into who owned the Gravlington rocks. Everyone who\nhad been at Cheapskate for more than a year knew that the citizens owned\nthe rocks, but Whygate had convinced Willhebe that it was a new\ndiscovery. Willhebe thought that his story had been very good, so he\ndecided to go and write a follow up. The new story was going to be called\n'Whygate: how I conquered Everest'\nWill Largeamounts allow Willhebe to write the story?\nWhat flavour will the next cake be?\nHow many sequins are there on Whygate's dress?\nFind out in the next episode of 'The Baron'\n\u2022 MILES HENDERSON, Dramsoc,\nNorman's and bar worker is currently\na homeless person. All week his\ncurrent landlord, a fellow physicist,\ntired of Miles' presence in his flat, has\nbeen creeping around trying to get\nshot of the erstwhile Mr Henderson.\nHaving failed to smuggle him into an\nall female flat in Hamlet, he then tried\nto squeeze him into the domicile of\nanother physicist. The physicist\nreferred the gentleman to his flat\nmates, who have made it perfectly\nwell known that Miles is about as\nwelcome as a fart in a space suit.\nMiles' predicament is now in the\nhands of the wardens in Hamlet. Will\nanyone take this man?\n\u2022 UNION PRESIDENT Ian\nHowgate, was this week victim of a carefully planned plot to place him in\nexile at the Harlington Sports Ground.\nThe hockey team 'forgot' to bring Ian\nback from Harlington. There\nfollowed de serpa te telephone pleas to\nChas 'Colonel Rambuka' Jackson in\nthe Holland Club. Conveniently,\nthere was no one in a fit state to bring\nhim back, as Chas was just off to the\nChem Eng buffet. Ian finally made it\nback, thus averting the planned coup.\n\u2022 ALAN HEPPER, Guild's Hon\nSec, has decided that, rather than put\nup with Guilds supremo Captain\nBraincell, he'll join the RCS. The\nRCS bar night on Sunday night saw\nMr Hepper, clad in RCS Motor Club\nsweatshirt enthusiastically, joining in\nwith the Kangela.\nFollowing suit, ex-Guilds hack and\nbar manager Jelly Johnson, decided\nhe'd get the 3H Pot out on Saturday\nnight and pass it around the assembled\nGuildsmen. Monday night saw the\nGuilds bar night outside the UD H. Heading the way into yet more abuse,\nCaptain Braincell. Clearly Guilds is\nlosing its popularity.\n*Star\nLetter\nDear Aunty Judith,\nOh dear, wrong again\u2014red faces all\nround in the Baron's column, I fear.\nNeither I nor Mr Whygate recollect\nthe conversation reported last week,\nbut I feel confident that my question\nwould not have been \"where does\nWhygate get his dope?\" but \"how\ncan Whygate be such a dope?\".\nTriflingly yours,\nCustard.\nFELIX Friday October 16th19875 "

Albums\nDepeche Mode\nMusic for the Masses\nDepeche Mode have had top thirty\nhits with their singles for over 6 years\nnow, but there recent albums,\nparticularly the last, were tending to\nreflect on the gloomy side. Music for\nthe Masses marks a slight change in\ndirection towards the chart orientated,\nalthough only on the first side. The\nother obvious single is Never Let Me\nDown Again, which should reach\nhigher than Strangelove. The songs\nare all by Martin Gore; Alan Wilder\nhasn't had a look in since 1984; and\nbetray the former's obsession with\nreligion, 15 year old girls, and the\nf util it iy of life. The only track I can't get into is the last track Pimpf, an\ninstrumental which sees the return of\nthe DM tradition of putting a30 second snippet of music on the last\ngrooves on the LP. I don't see the\npoint personally. Overall, the first\nside is a new departure, the second\nsimilar to Black Celebration. I don't regret buying it, some former DM fans will.\nR.F. THEA TRE\npeople stranded in a large house on\nan island, all but one are murdered\nat some point, fulfilling the r hymn which is now about Ten little\ntravellers. Wit, intrigue and a melodrama follow each other in rapid\nsuccession, almost distracting you\nfrom trying to identify the murderer.\nOh and by the way, it wasn't the\nbutler. The set was particularly\nimpressive, and the acting\nconsistently good by notables such as\nGlynis 'Makepeace' Barber, Rodney\n'Likely Lads' Bewes and Geoffrey\n'Bergerac' Davies.\nTickets \u00a35 to \u00a313.50.\nR.F. Hearts of Fire\nOne only has to think of examples\nsuch as Flashdance and Footloose to\nrealise that Hollywood excursions\ninto the realm of popular music\nusually leave a lot to be desired.\nPresently on release around London\nis a new rock music film, Hearts of\nFire which looked, at least\nsuperficially, to be different. For a start it starred Bob Dylan and Rupert\nEverett, the former lending some\nmusical credibility to the venture and\nthe latter some trendy young-British-actor credibility. Noting, however,\nthat the writers of Hearts of Fire had\nalso been responsible for one of the\ndreadful vehicles mentioned at the\nstart, my suspicions were aroused.\nThe story is a rags-to-riches affair\nrevolving around Molly McGuire,\nsmall time American bar singer, who\ngets her big break upon meeting up\nwith retired rock mega star Billy\nParker (Dylan). He whisks her off\nto London where she meets present-day rock start James Colt (Everett).\nWith the help of Colt she becomes an\ninstant success on the 'British Rock\nScene' and the rest of the movie is\ndevoted to the smash tour and\ninevitable relationship with Colt.\nSound clich ed? Well, that describes\nthe film pretty well. Some scenes\nwere so bad that it was like watching\nSpinal Tap or some similar spoof.\nApart from being totally unbelievable\nthe characters had strange\ninconsistencies: Colt, for instance, the\nirreverent, hedonistic rock star with\nVodka bottle in hand one minute, and\na caring, sensitive, lover and father\nthe next; Parker the retired, cynical\nrock guru who had 'seen it all' and\nthen proceeds to smash up hotel\nrooms like some 18 year-old heavy\nmetal singer; and then McGuire, who,\nafter having only sung in a small night\nclub all her life, steps out onto centre\nstage at the Hammersmith Odeon\nwithout the slightest hesitation or\nnervousness but then seems to cry\nthroughout the rest of the film at the\nslightest provocation.\nThese failures are not the fault of\nthe cast, though, who do reasonably\nwell considering the a palling material\nthey've been given excepting\nMcGuire, played by real-life\nAmerican singer Fiona, who seemed\ntoo inexperienced for a lead role. It\nis the script, essentially, that lets the\nfilm down, failing to convince at\nevery level.\nAlas even the music is terrible,\nbeing mostly boring soft-rock\nnumbers of the Suzi Quatro ilk, and\nthis, we are asked to believe, is an\ninstant success on the English club\ncircuit! The film is an American\nmovie producer's view of the rock\nworld, used as a background upon\nwhich to place a standard,\nunimaginative, Hollywood plot. It\nlived down to all my expectations.\nA.K.

    "content": "FELIX College\nAdministration\nwent into the\nnewspaper business\nthis week with the\npublication of\nNetwork, a monthly\nnews sheet directed\nat College staff\nIke\nOCTOBER 12, 1987\nVOLUME ONE, NUMBER ONE\nET WORK THE OFFICIAL REVIEW\n\u2022 \u2122 of\"\"\"\"^^\"^ r\\ NEWS\nThe newspaper is produced by the\nPublic Relations Department, under\nthe leadership of Iain More. Mr More\ntook on the mantle of Editor for the\nfirst edition, although, as the Rector\npoints out in his front page\nintroduction, the paper is still seeking\na full time Editor. The front page\nstates that the publication is not\nintended as a mouthpiece for College\nsupremo s, but on flipping through the\nslim twelve page pro pog and a sheet,\nthe readers will quickly form their\nown impression. After all, the Public\nRelations Department can hardly be\n[ ( considered impartial.\nThe paper's obviously expensive\nproduction at the time of Imperial\nCollege's financial crisis makes one\nwonder whether a 'Public Relations'\nexercise is justified. Even the Rector\nmentions this fact in his leader article.\nProf Ash continues by debating\nwhether the launch was premature,\nconsidering the lack of an Editor and\na shortage of readable articles. It is\nsurprising that they came down on the\nside of early publication, as the\ncontent of the first edition risks an\nearly loss of readership.\nThe style of writing is dry and\nimpersonal, leaving nothing to the\nimagination. In all cases the\nnewspaper attempts to show Imperial\nin a glowing light to an almost painful\nextent. This is not surprising since the\nEditor is also Director of the Alumnus\nOffice and Fund Raising. This last\nfact may explain why a quarter of the\nspace is devoted to the subjects of St\nMary's merger, and the activities of\nthe Alumnus Office. We are also\ngiven a taster of what to expect in the\nnext edition, a feature on Public\nRelations.\nThere is also a full page 'interview'\nwith Union President Ian Howgate.\nAfter discussion with Mr Howgate on\nthe date of publication (Tuesday) it\nbecame clear that even though he had\nhad an informal chat with Mr More\non the subject of the new College\nnewspaper, the question of an\ninterview never arose. The\nphotograph of Mr Howgate printed\nalongside the feature had been\nobtained from FELIX by the Public\nRelations Office (of which Mr More\nis director) on the pretext that it was\nto be used for the College Annual\nReport.\nThe article on Ian is the antithesis\nof the staff-student relationship at\nImperial. With phrases like 'summer\n88 is unlikely to see Ian Howgate end\nup any more than a relatively obscure\nfigure', and 'he was still winding\ndown\u2014or was he still wound up?\u2014\nover a meeting', the author pulls no\npunches. Throughout, Ian is\nportrayed as a figurehead with\n'limited ambitions', and making little\nimpact during his term of office.\nThe last paragraph consists of a torrent of praise for the Rector, and\nlambasts the efforts of the Union\nPresident as being ultimately\nineffective, 'a year is a short time at\nImperial and student Presidents come\nand go'.\nThe back page hosts a column\nentitled 'sport'. The sole article in the\nsection being a praise ridden\nglorification of IC Boat Club. The\npiece on Michael Arthur's favourite\nclub manages to incorporate the\nsubjects of Public Relations, fund\nraising, and the ever helpful Alumnus\nOffice in one fell swoop.\nOne might assume that a sports\narticle would be the least s usc ep table to manipulation for pro pog and a purposes, but not even Pravda\nachieves this sort of mileage out of\nrowing.\nThe only column inch of unbiased\ntext is the small ad on page nine\nadvertising a cottage to let. Even this\nis marred by the contact number (ext\n3004) which happens to be, surprise\nsurprise, the Press and Public\nRelations Office, 546b Sherfield.\nNuff said...\nDB and PH\n4 Friday October 16th1987 FELIX\n\n"

They are also concerned that the large music room in the building, currently used by the Chamber Music,\nOrchestra and Operatic Societies, will become unavailable next term and that no suitable replacement rooms\nhave yet been found. The Societies plan to draught a petition to College next week and IC Union is considering\norganising a demonstration to indicate the importance of having adequate music facilities within College.\nFour practice rooms, equipped with\nthree pianos, were lost during the\nSummer when the new School of\nManagement took over the Princes\nGate building from the Department of\nHumanities, which has since moved\nto the Mechanical Engineering\nBuilding. The main music room, on\nthe second floor of the building, will\nbe unavailable for the music societies\nafter Christmas, when conversion\nwork is due to begin on the ground\nand first floors.\nIn an interview with FELIX yesterday, a spokesman from the\nSchool of Management said that the\nMusic Room would be available for\nthe rest of this term, but added that\nthe room might be converted into a teaching room after Christmas. He\nwent on to explain that staff might be\nmoved into the music room whilst the\nbuilding conversions were in progress\nand said that the resulting dust and\nnoise would make music practice\ndifficult. The building work, said the\nspokesman, would continue until the\nSummer.\nIt is unclear whether or not the\nThursday lunchtime concerts,\norganised by the Humanities\ndepartment, will continue to be staged\nin this room. Dr Noel Baker, who\norganises the concerts, said that he\nwas un ware that building work would\nbe taking place.\nDavid Norburn, Head of the School\nof Management, wrote to the\nChamber Music Society this month\nrequesting that they investigate\nalternatives to the Music Room. The\nSociety was unable to find any rooms\navailable of the correct size and\nacoustic cha rect eris tics required for\nmusic practice, although the Rector\nand College Secretary have since\nsuggested a number of pos sibi lites. These include a Common Room on\nthe top floor of Physics and the lecture\ntheatres currently under construction\nin the former Holland Club in Huxley. Also under consideration is\na proposal to utilise the space beneath\nthe Queens Tower. Commenting on\nthese suggestions, Malcolm Aldridge,\na member of the College's Music\nCommittee, said that the Physics\nCoffee Room suffered from poor\nacoustics because of sound damping\ncaused by the room's polystyrene tiles\nand soft furnishings. He added that\nthe space beneath the Queens Tower\ncould only be used if the College was\nprepared to spend a large amount of\nmoney to make the area inhabitable,\nbut said that the Holland Club lecture\ntheatres might prove suitable,\nalthough this had to be looked into.\nTemporary practice facilities and two\npianos have been provided in the\nRector's Conference Room and the\nPippard lecture theatres in Sherfield,\nand it is likely that permanent\nfacilities will be arranged by\nNovember. A store room on level\nfour of the building, and the\ncommittee rooms controlled by the\nConference Office along with two\ncareers interview rooms have been\nearmarked as possible locations,\nalthough negotiations are still\nunderway. The Music Committee is\nunderstood to be unhappy with the\nPippard Theatre and the Conference\nRoom, which, they say,. are\nunsatisfactory.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION "

    "content": "Soul Searching\nMost Victorians\nbelieved Genesis\nimplicit ely, Animals were not\nallowed into\nchurch because\nthey had no souls.\nGod made man in\nhis own image,\nwith an immortal\nsoul, and the\nanimals were a totally separate\ncreation;\nornaments on a mantlepiece.\nPeople had suggested ways in which\nanimal groups were related before,\nsuch as Le Marc, the inventor of the\nrubber giraffe, which stretched its\nneck to reach high trees, and bore\nyoung with longer necks.\nDarwin's sin was to suggest the\ninclusion of man in this scheme of\nthings. The implications were of\ncourse that man was no longer\ndirectly a child of God, and that one\nhad either to credit at least the\nprimates with immortal souls too, or\nto deny the soul which had made\ndown-trodden people semi-resigned\nto their lot since the feudal times. If\nthese people couldn't be sure of\neternal life in Heaven watching their\nrich masters burn in hell, they were\nmuch more likely to shout about\nworkers rights. This theory of\nevolution was dangerous to religion\nand politics, and for decades it was\nforbidden to teach it in sh cools in the\nmost powerful free society\u2014the\nUnited States.\nWith the new century, psychology\nwas being practised more, and it\nseemed that terms like Ego and Id\nwere components of the soul.\nHowever, the new approach to what\nhad been called madness that came\nwith it, meant that rather than locking\nup people who behaved abnormally,\nand pronouncing them to be\npossessed, some of the less severe\ncases could be treated with new but\nprimitive techniques that had nothing\nto do with exorcising evil spirits.\nSome of these conditions, now their\nreality is no longer denied, throw up\ninteresting questions about the\nmind/body real tion ship, and about the\nsoul. Senility, in which the sufferer\neventually looses nearly all aspects of\ntheir personality, goes a long way to\nshow how much of a personality\nresides in an immortal soul and how\nmuch can be destroyed by\nprecipitation of salts in the brain. If\nsuch aspects of personality cannot\nsurvive life intact, they are most\nunlikely to survive death.\nMultiple personality, in which the\nsufferer has within one body, totally\nseparate personalities with separate\nmemories, often unaware of each\nother, is difficult to explain in terms\nof a single soul. It has even been\nshown that memories are stored\nphysically in the brain, and what is\na person without memories? Still\nfeelings, attitudes and emotions\nperhaps, but even these can be\nchanged by chemicals such as anti-depressants, pen to thal, and other socalled truth-drugs. So what attributes\nare part of an immortal soul?\nIf humans have evolved from a few\nproteins in the sea, there must have\nbeen some stage at which a soul\nevolved too, if we have such a thing.\nOf course you can say that lower\nanimals have souls which are less\ndeveloped, and this is certainly a good\nargument for vegetarianism, but\nimmortality is a clear cut thing. There\nmust have been some point at which\na developing soul became immortal\nand what of the first one. Heaven\nmust have been a very lonely place\nwith just God, Jesus and the first\nimmortal soul to arrive. Of course it\nmust be much more crowded now,\nhowever there is only room for\n144,000, according to Revelations.\nWhat of the 144,001st soul at St\nPeter's Gate? What if it were some\nreally deserving soul who had lived\na saintly life? A religious authority\ntold me that the figure of 144,000 was\nno longer appropriate, and that John\nthe Divine had based it on the world\npopulation at that time, I was always\ntold that the Bible was divinely\ninspired, but if that bit isn't, which\nother parts aren't? Genesis perhaps?\nor Romans?\nA human being is a remarkably\ncomplex thing, and whether or not it\nhas a soul will not be a matter of fact\nfor many decades I suspect. But what\nof a single cell human zygote, does\nthat have a soul? Embryo research is\nfrowned upon by the Church on the\nbasis that the fate of the embryo in the\nlab constitutes murder, so they seem\nto say yes. What kind of soul is that?\nThe idea that we have evolved from\nprotein in the sea and that all we are\nis determined by our physical\nstructure is fairly unbelievable, but so\nis a belief in man's immortal soul and\nin the individual creation by God of\nunchanging animal species without\nsouls. However, a belief in the\nimmortal soul does have a huge\nadvantage. It saves people from\nhaving to contemplate their own\ndestruction. We are all egotists in the\nsense that we don't want to die. Those\nnon-religious people who ignore the\nissue entirely, often get quite irritated\nby talk of death and souls. Many such\npeople experience religious\nconversion in later life, or are\nchristened on their death bed, as\nhappened to Constantine. Personally,\nI'd rather die than have eternal life.\nRG Fincher\nFELIX Friday October 16th198713 "

    "content": "FELIX \u2014 :\nOPINION\nWhat positive\nalternatives?\nRecently, men seem to be taking an\ninordinate interest in a subject which\nis of crucial importance to\nwomen\u2014abortion.\nContrary to the simplistic\narguments presented by anti-abortion\nsupporters, the 9 month period during\nwhich a woman carries a baby wreaks\nmajor changes in her body and life,\nespecially on her standing in society.\nThe majority of women definitely\ndo not see abortion as a simple\nmorning-after birth control method-it's far too traumatic an experience to\nbe taken so lightly. Abortion figures\nare blithely quoted with insufficient\nelaboration. For example what\npercentage of women above child\nbearing age ever have abortions, and\nmore to the point, how many women\nhave more than one abortion? Also,\nhow many of these unwanted\npregnancies are statistics of\ncontraceptive failure? Unreported and\nacquaintance rapes are also a real\nproblem.\nI, too, am pro-life\u2014the mother's life. I will not argue about when life\nbegins\u2014every fertilised egg is a potential human being. The woman\nis an actuality, a human being who\nhas been existing independent of her\nmother's womb for quite some time.\nShe deserves the right to a real and\nsafe choice as to what happens to her\nbody. Protection from the trauma and\nrisk of an illegal abortion should be\nher fundamental right.\nPositive alternatives to having an\nabortion are a good idea because they\nincrease a woman's options. The\nPositive Alternatives to Abortion\ngroup at College is a lousy idea. Last\nterm, they managed to fill numerous\nCollege pigeonholes with their\nsensationalist' 'if you were born after\n1967 you are a survivor of the 1967\nabortion act\" leaflets.\nThis was not positive. I am a woman\u2014one of the 16% of people at\nthis College who is ever likely to need\nan abortion. Why haven't they\nmanaged to send me any information\nabout positive alternatives?\nI think this group of anti-abortionists (they are mostly men)\nshould stop masquerading under the\ncaring title of PATA.

    "content": "UNDER THE MICROgjSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nAtom smashers\nThe Fermi National Accelerator\nLaboratory (the Chicago site that\nhouses the world's biggest atom\nsmasher) is finally doing two things\nthat the average person can\nappreciate: conserving rare animals\nand making cheese.\nApparently, the 400 acres inside the\nring of the large particle accelerator,\nnow contains one of the last remaining\ntracts of unspoilt natural (whole meal, no artificial preservatives or\ncolourings) prairie. This is because\nthe first director of Fermilab had a team of conservationists start to plant\nthe land with a mix of authentic plants\nthat recreated the old pre-white-man\nenvironment. The land now also\ncontains a large herd of buffalo,\nwhich is breeding so successfully that\nthey have to sell off the surplus.\nThe cheese comes from the buffalo;\nthey are apparently the only true\nsource of gourmet mozzarella cheese,\na much prized substance in posh\nhotels. Fermilab are trying to get\nmoney from the National Science\nFoundation (a sort of American\nSERC) to further the programme.\nConsidering how much money goes\ninto the particle accelerator just to\nbang very small things together more\nviolently than anyone else, it is\nprobably a good investment. (The\nIndependent 28/9/87.)\nA younger universe\nAstronomy is a difficult science; it is\nshort of facts and overburdened with\ntheories. Take, for example, the age\nof the universe. It is impossible to\nmeasure it directly, so it has to be\nguessed from other observations such\nas guessing how long different types\nof star last, given theories of how\nstars evolve. So it is always great fun\nfor astronomers to invent a new way\nof guessing the age of things.\nA Dutch astronomer has recently\ndone just that, by comparing the ratios.\nof two elements in stars. The elements\nare thorium-232, which is radioactive\nwith a half life of 15 billion years, and\nneodymium-142, which is stable. His\nresults suggest that the galaxy is\nconsiderably younger than the recent\nc once nus. This is causing the sort of\nconsiderable controversy that\nastronomers just love to have, so that\nthey can relieve the monotony of\nactually having to make observations.\nThe theory behind the new\nmeasurement is this. The two\nelements have spectral lines that are\nconveniently close so they can both \u2022\nbe observed at once and there are no\nmessy corrections for environmental\neffects or differing sensitivities to\ndifferent spectral areas. The thorium\ndecays and so the ratio of the two\nelements should change with the age\nof the star: older stars should have\nless thorium. The observations\nsuggest very little difference between\nthe old and young stars that were\nlooked at: this implies a maximum\nage for the universe of about 11\nbillion years (ie up to 8 billion less\nthan previously thought).\nSome people agree with the new\nage, but many disagree. There are\nsome reasons for scepticism: the\nspectral lines are very weak (making\nobservations prone to error), there is\nmore than one way to make\nneodymium in stars (this could throw\nthe ratio off beam), meteorite isotopic\nabundances may contradict the data\nand anyway, arguments are good fun.\nIt is impossible to come to a conclusion about the new\ninformation: in astronomy there are\nalways more opinions than\nastronomers. But the more new ways\nof measuring the data of creation we\nthink up, the more likely we will be\nto get it right in the end. If we are\nlucky, we will get a public holiday on\nthe an iv ersary.( Science 237 p361, Nature 328 pi27.) This page of FELIX is not just here to contain boring new stories pla gia rise d from New Scientist: who would want to read that? It will (if enough people\ncontribute to it; contain long features (explaining interesting specialist things\nthat most people do not know about), interesting short reports on topical\nsubjects, and comment (where individuals get the chance to rant about sonic\nscientific issue they mink is important).\nWe need two kinds of input from readers: suggestions about what you want\nto read and informed comment on things you know about. Anyone is welcome\nto contribute either short or long pieces, but people who know about life\nsciences, earth sciences or engineering will be most welcome because they\nusually seem to gel left out.\nWho pays?\nThe Government has repeatedly stated\nits desire for universities to get more\nmoney from industry for research.\nThis is supposed to give a moribund\ninstitution a shot of free-market\nadrenal in. This makes me worry a great deal\nabout the future of Britain's higher\neducation. It is not that getting money\nfrom the real world is particularly bad\nin itself (but basic pure research needs\nto be supported and industry cannot\nbe expected to pay for research when\nthere are no products in sight) but\nhistory shows that most of British\nindustry has not wanted to pay for any\nresearch, even in-house research and\ndevelopment.\nA statistical analysis by the Science\nPolicy Research Unit at Sussex\nUniversity (New Scientist 10/9/87}\nshows that one of the prime reasons\nfor the failure of our industry in world\nmarkets is its failure to invest past\nprofits in R&D. Those (few) areas of\nindustry who plough large amounts of\ntheir profits back into research have\ndone rather well in world terms\n(chemicals and drugs are the main\nsuccess stories). The rest have\npreferred to withdraw from profitable\nbut risky areas to safe fields, such as\ndefence, where they can get someone\nelse to pay for the research.\nAside from the dubious morality of\nthis when it encourages the arms race,\nin the long term it is a recipe for\nindustrial decline: fewer and fewer\ncountries can afford to buy the\nincreasingly baroque products of high\ntechnology military madness. Also,\ncosy agreements with governments\ntend to produce poor products that no\none else wants to buy (system X and\nnimrod are good examples).\nOur world competitors spend far\nmore than us on both basic and\napplied science. For example, in the\nsixties, when the German car industry\nwas investing heavily in new ideas,\nthe British car industry was living off\nits past and spending nothing for the\nfuture. The whole country later\nsuffered for this neglect.\nAttitudes have not changed over the\nyears: the soon-to-finish-in-chaos\nAlvey programme provides more\nmeat for my argument. It started as\na commendable effort by Government\n(industry wasn't going to pay for\nitself) to encourage information\ntechnology. Universities have done a lot of good work with Alvey money,\nthough much of it is now in jea por dy because of the stupidity of t ne way the\nGovernment manages research.\nIn what appears to be an effort to\nprove that governments are\nincompetent in their handling of\npublic funds, the cabinet has been\nputting off a decision on the future of\nAlvey (The Guardian 8/10/87).\nThere is still no sign of a decision,\neven though the original grants are\nnow running out. The uncertainty is\ndisastrous; it would have been better\nto have announced last year that there\nwould be no more money, then there\nwould have been time to drastically\nre-think existing plans. By repeatedly\npromising more money and then\ndelaying the actual decision, the\nGovernment has caused chaos; a lot\nof the good from Alvey will now go\ndown the drain.\nMoney went to the electronics\nindustry as well, on an \"industry\npound for a Government pound\"\nbasis. The trouble was that the\ncompanies who got the most money\nwere the very ones who have been\nmilking the Government of money for\nyears and never spending any of their\nown. Small innovative companies\nwith real commitment to research, but\nwith limited resources to do it, were\nsqueezed out of the race. Companies\nlike GEC( which had and has more\nmoney in the bank than the\nGovernment spent on the whole\nAlvey programme) received the\nmoney, did research and are dropping\nthe research now that the easy money\nhas dried up.\nThese are the same people who\nhave, in pursuit of safe profits,\nthrown the country's money down the\nbottomless pit of defence research and\ncosy deals with public monopolies.\nThese are the people the Government\nwants to pay for university research.\n(The Government reckons that the\nstate cannot afford it now that the\nchancellor has given all the money\naway in income tax cuts.) Perhaps\nthey just want to blame the decline in\nBritish education on the same people\nwho caused the decline in British\nindustry.\nThe universities have been blamed\nfor not producing enough useful\nscience. This ignores how many good\nideas have been produced by\nuniversities and ignored by industry.\nIt is British industry and\nGovernment that need a kick up the\narse, not the universities.\n8 Friday October 16th1987 FELIX "
