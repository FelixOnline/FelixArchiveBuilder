    "content": "BOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nInside the Centre\nMaciej Matuszeski reviews Ray Monk\u2019s Oppenheimer biography\nay Monk has long been\nhighly regarded as a\nskilled biographer. A\nphilosopher himself, his\n1991 biography of Wittgenstein won him the John Llewellyn\nRhys Prize. In his latest work, howev-er, Monk has chosen to explore the life\nof one of America\u2019s most controversial\nscientists \u2013 Robert Oppenheimer.\nWhile currently best remembered\nfor his work on the Manhattan Project, he was a fascinating and complex\nman. At \ufb01rst sight, indeed, he appears\nto be a man of great inconsistencies.\nHe was always academically brilliant\nyet, while studying at Cambridge, he\nbecome so depressed with feelings\nabout his inadequacies that he allegedly attempted to murder PMS Blackett with a poisoned apple. In the early\n1930s he was so out of touch with\ncurrent a\ufb00airs that he was unaware of\nthe Wall Street Crash yet twenty years\nlater his left wing political sympathies\ncost him his security clearance.\nMonk, however, argues that\nthroughout his life, Oppenheimer was\ndeeply driven by a goal to achieve his\nfull potential. In other words, to be the\ncentre of everything he could.\nhis is a convincingly argued theory\nand the book shows the decade of research that Monk has devoted to it.\nhis is a truly insightful work and is\nsurely set to become the de\ufb01nitive text\non Oppenheimer.\nR\n\u201che story is a poem disguised in\nprose\u201d, says the introduction to the\n2007 edition of this novel.\nIt is exactly that.\nhe story has no order or structure;\narguably a mere progression in the\nlives of our four characters. he book\nis a true exhibition of the author\u2019s admirable ability to narrate: a gripping\nstory where nothing happens.\nFour people: a middle aged man, a\nburnt body of an explorer, a twenty\nyear old nurse and a sapper from\nPunjab; all in a lonely landscape of\nrural Italy with nothing to do but\nwait, breathe, observe and let the\nemotions of the terrible war \ufb02ow back\nto the place where they will stay for\nthe rest of their lives.\nhings can happen at 2am in the\nmorning as well as at midday or dawn:\nthere is no time or obligation, just the\nsun, the sky, a library and candles.\nWhat is the story about?\nObjectively about nothing.\nJust like life.\nWhat have you done during your\nweekend?\nNothing.\nAsk me again and I\u2019ll tell you what\nmade me laugh or cry.\nSentences are not precise.\nNo, not necessarily, not always.\n\u201cWhite sound\u201d \u2013 \u2026? Yes, a sound\nthat makes you blind, oh yes, you just\nrealise three sentences later that the\nexpression was actually a metaphor.\nMichael Ondaatje takes you\nthrough their experiences as paintbrush strokes across an empty can-vas. Images, scenes\u2026 an impression, a\nthought\u2026 the narrators vary, the four\ncharacters remember the past that\nbrought them here. It establishes the\ntone: memories, \ufb02ashes \u2013 you might\nhear the same story twice, the second\ntime with another hint of emotion.\nYou are taken to the desert of Libya across the golden sands and into\nthe sweaty rooms of Cairo and then\nback to the valley in Tuscany, mined,\nshelled and abandoned. You are immersed in the war, crossing muddy\n\ufb01elds at night under the light of bombing \ufb01re. You experience the horror of\nhospitals, nurses expected to act like\npriests accompanying \u2013 constantly \u2013\nthe souls imprisoned in their broken\nbodies to their death.\nhere are paragraphs that make you\nstop.\nAgain?\nIt was just absolutely beautiful and\nexact. How did he manage to say that\nso well?\n\u2026sentences you could rip o\ufb00 the\nbook and put on the wall.\nAmanda tweets as @amandsllu\nRobert Oppenheimer (right) with his\noccasional collaborator, Niels Bohr\nMichael Ondaatje The English Patient\nAmanda Diez Writer\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 FRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nWhat aspect of your internship did you enjoy most?\nThe fact that the work I was doing actually went into active projects that would be seen by senior\nmanagement and clients. It made a great change from say, writing a lab report, where the experiment has been done a hundred times previously, everyone already knows the outcome and\nthere is little space for individuality.\nWhat aspect of your internship did you dislike most?\nDeadline changes! Now and then the piece of work you had planned to finish for the end of the\nweek could be required the very next morning \u2013 something that doesn\u2019t really happen at university and that takes a bit of getting used to.\nDid you feel your work was valued by your team?\nGradually, yes. Due to the nature of the work, the team you\u2019re with can\u2019t give you free reign with\nan assignment straight off the bat, however as the summer progressed I was allowed to make\nmore of my own judgements on various aspects of a project.\nDid your internship give you the opportunity to develop your skills and\nincrease your knowledge?\nYes, a huge amount of information was available and had to be applied continuously throughout\nthe summer. The hours may seem very tough to some, however in practical terms I was able to\ngain so much more experience within a single summer compared to an \u2018ordinary\u2019 9-5 job.\nWould you like to work at the organisation full time? Why / Why not?\nI enjoyed working with the people within my team and the sector itself interests me greatly so I\nwould be more than happy to go back.\nWhat aspect of your internship did you enjoy most?\nMeeting and working with people my age, who had the same ambitions and goals as me. Also,\ngetting help and guidance from people who had been working at the company for a while. It\nfelt very friendly.\nWhat aspect of your internship did you dislike most?\nThe limited number of full time offers available often meant that stress levels were high. There\nwas a lot of pressure to produce high quality work, and this often meant working long hours.\nHaving said that, the intensity wasn\u2019t as high as Imperial; managers are very wary of burnout,\nand there is an ethos of making the job sustainable in the long term (I think this is more of a\nLondon thing rather than an industry thing).\nDid you feel your work was valued by your team?\nAs an intern it is difficult to produce \u201cvaluable\u201d work because you probably don\u2019t have the skill\nset required yet. What is really valued is the amount of effort you put into the work, which is\nreflected in its quality. Giving interns work to do actually tends to slow full-time staff down, but\nit does provide them with an idea of what it would be like to work with you, which is the most\nimportant thing, as the rest can be learned.\nDid your internship gave your the opportunity to develop your skills\nand increase your knowledge?\nThe internship was a form of immersive learning. No academic course can prepare you for the\nskills you learn when you are on the job. This is part of the reason why there are no prerequisites\nor degree requirements for the job. I learned valuable life skills very quickly, which I believe\nwere more valuable than the technical skills I picked up.\nWould you like to work at the organisation full time? Why / Why not?\nI loved my internship and got along with my team really well. The culture of the firm was very\nfriendly and it was a great place to spend my summer. I accepted an offer to work full-time and\nI am really looking forward to going back.\nI don\u2019t think that the work is for everyone and there are downsides to the job. But there are\ndownsides to every job, and for me these were far outweighed by the fact I am working on something I enjoy, the opportunities the job offers, and the people I will be working with day-to-day.\nInternship decisons: City? ..\nAlready secured a city internship for summer \u201813? Or perhaps you\u2019re lo\n4th year Chemist\nIntro\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, London Accenture, London\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, London\nWhat aspect of your internship did you enjoy most?\nWorking with a senior member of the firm to help compile some initial information for a client bid. The client project was in Africa and so I was tasked with compiling information about\nrelated work Accenture has done in Africa in the past. It meant I needed to be resourceful, show\ninitiative and also got the chance to speak with colleagues in places such as Johannesburg and\nLagos.\nWhat aspect of your internship did you dislike most?\nAs consultants often work on their client\u2019s sites, I was based in the less than exotic Park Royal (at\nthe end of the West bound Piccadilly line). This meant I didn\u2019t get to join all of the intern social\nevents in the city and sometimes felt a bit isolated\nDid you feel your work was valued by your team?\nKind of. Although I felt that I didn\u2019t have enough technical knowledge to add value most of the\ntime\nDid your internship give you the opportunity to develop your skills and\nincrease your knowledge?\nIn some areas, definitely yes. However, at times I felt like I was being given mundane tasks such\nas preparing ppt. slides and updating spreadsheets that weren\u2019t giving me much insight into\nhow the firm operated.\nWould you like to work at the organisation full time? Why / Why not?\nThe people area great and the work is varied and can be interesting. Consulting work is highly\ndependent on your team, location and project and this gamble would be one of the things that\nwould deter me from going back.\n4th year Chemist\nEveryone wants one. Some people seem to want one more than they want their degree. And\nsome lucky people alrealy have one. Gone are the days where Imperial students waste their\nsummers away in Kavos indoors watching Crystal Maze repeats, in these \u2018tough times\u2019 it\u2019s all\nabout the summer internship.\nBut what makes a good internship? What do we want to gain from a summer of work? And\nwhere can we \ufb01nd the best experiences? We all know that the big city \ufb01rms o\ufb00er up healthy pay\npackets in exchange for long hours and the oportunity to sample the life of an analyst. But how\ndo internships elsewhere compare. Are internships in the not-for-pro\ufb01t and charity sectors\nvaluable too? Read these reports from Imperial students who have sampled both to \ufb01nd out...\n4th year Physicist\n\n"

    "content": "LOLCAT OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nWhere to work\nhis week there is a feature\non page 10 (it\u2019s one of my\npicks) about internships.\nThe basic idea is to interview a few people who\nhave done city internships and some\nthat have done third sector work. The\nplan is to see what similarities and differences there are. Obviously, this isn\u2019t\nsome survey from the survey fetishists\nover at Ipsos MORI, so it\u2019s not the largest most scientific set of data. What\u2019s\ninteresting is the general trend: we like\ninternships (and you can extrapolate\njobs) where we gain some kind of valuable experience, and where we feel like\nwe are actually a valued and important member of the team. Of course, if\nyour long term goal is to just work for\nthe company, then you may be more\ninterested in networking during an in-ternship, and there are many other situations where you may want different\nexperiences. For example, horny people\nmaybeseekingmultiplesexualpartners\nwhile also wanting to be valued for their\nhardwork\u2013butIwouldn\u2019tputdown\u201csex\ndrive of Russell Brand\u201d on your CV. The\npoint is that we obviously want to feel\nwanted in some way. Nobody wants to\njust be the person updating a calendar\nor reformatting a word document.\nWhen reading the feature, you can\nmake up your mind as to what you\nthink and which of the jobs sounds best\nbased on what they liked and hated the\nmost.\nThe reason I write this is because\nelections are on their way. That\u2019s when\nI\u2019m deposed and someone else takes a\ncrack at it.\nWhat do I do after this year? Journalism? Science? Science journalism? Do\nI apply for a job in the city? I\u2019ve been\nthinking about it. Don\u2019t lie and say\nyou\u2019ve never entertained the thought,\nwe all have had that \u201chmm, maybe\u201d\nthought.Forsomepeople,theyreallydo\nfindfinanceandeconomicsfascinating.\nOr they just really like the environment\nof a company. Perhaps they like the\nfact that there is sense of camaraderie.\nThat\u2019s absolutely fine if you do. Personally, except for the fact that you get to\nmeet a bunch of new people, I don\u2019t\nthink I really have much interest in that\nsector.\nYou may then reasonably think that it\nseems odd to even think about starting\na career in a job you don\u2019t really care for\ntoo much. Thinking about it a bit more, I\nrealised that the reason for this sudden,\nstrange urge to wear a suit and tie every\nday was the security it could potentially\noffer. The job not the suit \u2013 that would\nprobably rip fairly easily, and so wouldn\u2019t\nbe that safe. A job at a big company\nbrings with it a guaranteed salary and\na stable structure to your weekdays.\nSome people really hate not having\na structure, some love it. I remember\na friend from halls being very excited\nabout becoming an accountant (I know,\nmy friends sound like a right laugh).\nI found it amazing that you could really want that, but he insisted he did. He\ndisclosed the reason: the fact that you\nwake up and go into an office, then you\ngo home at a similar time each day was\nthe real reason he enjoyed it.\nI think I quite like being able to choose\na structure to my day, but also having\nsomething to aim at is always a good\nmotivator.\nThen what about being an entrepreneur or doing something a little bit different without a guarenteed salary?\nWell, it really is a risk/reward (uhoh this\nsounds like economics) game. You risk\nhaving no security and being tired and\nstressed. That\u2019s not to say that the city,\nand jobhunting, is not stressful, but,\nyou know what I mean. The reward\nwould be doing a job you really love. If\nyou don\u2019t love the city, then think about\nother careers and decide if you want to\ntake the risk. I\u2019ll be doing so.\nThat leaves me back at the all too\ncommon university student problem:\n\u201cwhat do I want to do when I grow up.\nOh, shit, I\u2019m grown up.

The trust too. I was PA to Director and Project Manager. The\nproject I was in charge of aimed at analysing where communication departments sit within UK\ncharities, how they are run as well as how they relate to the other core functions within the\norganization.\nWhat aspect of your internship did you dislike most?\nThe team I joined was rather small; hence we all had to contribute to the tedious yet necessary\ntasks such as mass emailing or database cleaning.\nDid you feel your work was valued by your team?\nDefinitely.\nDid your internship give you the opportunity to develop your skills and\nincrease your knowledge?\nYes, I was given a lot of autonomy and freedom in my work, and could interact with member\norganisations without direct supervision, which felt very gratifying.\nWould you like to work at the organisation full time? Why / Why not?\nNot in the near future, there\u2019s a great deal of things I would like to try my hand at first! However\nI have thoroughly enjoyed being an active part of such a dynamic team and don\u2019t exclude the\npossibility of joining a similar professional framework at some point in the future.\n3rd year Mathematician\nConclusion?\n.. Or Charity?\nooking to work in the third sector? Caroline Wood compares the two\nWellcome Trust\nWhat aspect of your internship did you enjoy most?\nI enjoyed the freedom and lack of hierarchy in the workplace. I was able to ask anyone questions\nand they were willing to talk to all the interns.\nWhat aspect of your internship did you dislike most?\nI disliked the lack of structure in certain aspects of the internship. For example at times I felt I\nwas doing filler-jobs that weren\u2019t properly thought through.\nDid you feel your work was valued by your team?\nI do feel my work was valued however I feel I could have done more.\nDid your internship give you the opportunity to develop your skills and\nincrease your knowledge?\nYes it did. I was surrounded by intelligent people, many of them extremely knowledgeable in\nfields I would like to go into.\nWould you like to work at the organisation full time? Why / Why not?\nI would definitely like to work for the organisation full-time. The Wellcome Trust funds biomedical research and although I\u2019ve enjoyed my degree , I don\u2019t want to become a researcher.\nWorking in science, but not at the bench really appeals to me.\n3rd year Biologist\nRhiannon spent a six week placement with AHPN, the African Health Policy Network as\npart of the Imperial Hub ethical internship scheme. Here\u2019s her report:\nI took part in the Ethical Internship Scheme just after completing my second year of a Biomedical Engineering degree at Imperial College London. I applied to the scheme as I was keen to\nexplore slightly different career options than those of my course mates, i.e. I don\u2019t want to be\na research scientist, doctor or banker! I knew I wanted to bridge a gap between the scientific\nelite and the wider community, educating those who otherwise would be fearful of change and\ndevelopment.\nAfter the Easter networking event for all Student Hubs interns, I knew I\u2019d met the type of people I would like to work with one day: they were dynamic, fascinating and impassioned people\nwho weren\u2019t afraid to play silly games and express themselves unashamedly.\nMy six week placement was with AHPN, the African Health Policy Network, a charity that\nseeks to represent the healthcare needs and opinions of the Black African population living in\nthe UK, as well as disseminating guidance and education concerning six key health care issues,\nknown to affect the Black African community disproportionally (HIV, Tuberculosis, Breast and\nProstate Cancer, Mental Health, Stroke and Diabetes) My main project was to re-draft a report\npublished by BHIVA, the British HIV Association, which outlined the latest treatment guide-lines, making it more accessible and relevant to community members. Processing the report\nin its original form was quite tough going, (I got the sense they\u2019d been waiting for a scientist\nlike me to come aboard!) but with a little bit of online research I reached the bare bones of the\nreport.\nIt was important information, previously buried under scientific vocabulary; it felt great to\ndig it out to genuinely help the lives of others for the long term. I suppose I used my scientific\npowers for good this time!.\n3rd year Biomedical Engineer\nEthical Internship with AHPN, the African Health Policy Network\nhis very unofficial comparison of internships within di\ufb00erent sectors draws out, for me, one\nkey point. We like internships where we feel we are gaining valuable experiences. hat may be\nnetworking with a team in a sector where we know we want to work, or having the opportunity\nto apply our skills to novel situations outside of the library/lab. As long as we are learning, gaining skills and expanding our knowledge we generally seem quite satis\ufb01ed.\nIf you know what you want to do then it\u2019s obviously best to seek an internship in that particular area. However, if you are not sure what career path you want to take, does it really matter\nwhere you intern? In my opinion, not really.\nA good and useful experience is worthwhile whether it\u2019s with a corporate or a charity. After\nall, that\u2019s what an internship is all about right? Trying new things to see what parts you like and\nwhat parts you don\u2019t.\nIf you are still thinking about what to\ndo this summer and fancy trying something a bit different, you can still apply\nto the Imperial Hub Ethical Internship\nscheme before 5pm on Monday 21st\nFeburary. More details can be found by\nsearching \u201cStudent Hubs Ethical Internships\u201d or by checking out the Imperial\nHub Facebook page.\n\n"

Experiments on the tropical fresh-water \ufb01sh\nspecies Poecilia mexicana presented\ninteresting results that could solve\nthe Darwinian puzzle of same-sex\nmating, despite it occurring in a multitude of species, including our own.\nIt has previously been found that\nfemale mate choice in certain species\nis dependent on information gathered\nwhilst observing the social interactions of the candidates in mind, to determine if they are worthy of copula-tion. Social interactions observed can\nbe sexual or not, and allow for an insight into the reproductive quality of\nthe male in question. Such organisms,\nsuch as P. Mexicana, prefer to just sit\nback and watch the action, then go\nfrom there.\nIn particular, these nosy \ufb01sh like to\nobserve males consorting with other\nfemales, and tend to prefer mating\nwith those that they have already observed getting frisky. his \u201csharing\nis caring\u201d attitude is known as mate\nchoice copying, and places a signi\ufb01cant value on mating behaviour. However, with the social hierarchies seemingly experienced in high schools\neverywhere also common to \ufb01sh\nshoals, it is often the case that some\n\u201csubordinate\u201d males cannot access the\ntop notch females of the community.\nListening to the song \u2018Teenage Dirt\nbag\u2019 allows for understanding of how\nthis translates Homo sapiens, but, unlike two tickets to an Iron Maiden\ngig, these \ufb01sh have developed something a bit sneakier to bag that mate.\nhese lonely males attempt to improve their mating chances by simply\nmating with each other to exploit the\nmate choice copying strategy, and it\nseems like this homosexual behaviour\ndoes the trick. P. mexicana are prone\nto a behavioural trait known as nip-ping, where males nip at the female\ngenital opening prior to copulation,\nand this was \ufb01lmed between two male\n\ufb01sh, one notably less colourful and\ntherefore less attractive, and shown to\na female on a screen. It was found that\na signi\ufb01cant increase was observed in\nthe females\u2019 attraction to the drabber\nof the male pair, and not only that, as\nthere was no signi\ufb01cant preference\nbetween the males\u2019 homosexual behaviour and heterosexual behaviour,\nit doesn\u2019t seem to matter too much\nwho you are screwing, as long as you\nare screwing someone in the eyes of\nthese \ufb01ckle females.\nhis therefore means that in this\nspecies of \ufb01sh, being a bit more experimental can do you some favours\nif you are particularly unattractive\nmale. However, does this translate to\nthe wider world of homosexual occur-rences?\nExclusive homosexuality so far has\nonly been observed in humans, sheep\nand certain birds, although bisexual\nmale mating behaviour is much more\nprominent. Homosexuality has been a\nDarwinian puzzle for decades, with it\nseemingly resulting in decreasing the\nmale reproductive \ufb01tness, although\nnew research is constantly honing in\non what could cause homosexuality\nand why.\nMany independent studies into human homosexuality have determined\nthat people are probably born with\ntheir sexuality de\ufb01ned as opposed to\nbeing environmentally in\ufb02uenced.\nDi\ufb00erences in brain structure between homosexual males and heterosexual males have been noted,\nalongside the pattern of brain activation seen in homosexual men and heterosexual females being distinct from\nthat of heterosexual men. Genetic\nmarkers on Xq28, a region on the X\nchromosome, and also possibly on\nthree other chromosomes have been\nstatistically linked to sexual orientation too.\nherefore considering the behav-iourally-derived advantages of same\nsex mating alongside biological in\ufb02uences may provide an alternative\nview point of the evolution of this\ncompletely natural phenomenon. his\nresearch could further the dialogue\nabout the intricacies behind same sex\nmating across the multitude of species\nit has been observed in, and bring us\na step closer to understanding it fully.\nSo, regardless of the species in-volved, the evolutionary derivation it\nmay have and what Westboro Baptist\nChurch say on the matter, same sex\nmating is highly prevalent in nature,\nand it could be that it will be fully\nunderstood as to why within our life-time. Until then however, tread carefully when from taking a leaf out of\nthe P. mexicana book of love \u2013 what\nmay work for these \ufb01sh may not necessarily work for other species.\nDOI: 10.1038/493136a\nN\nEven at Imperial I doubt you\u2019d \ufb01nd biology students wearing T-shirts referring to Lamarckism, but you especially wouldn\u2019t \ufb01nd them wearing shirts\nthat deride, \u201cIn hindsight, pretty\nridiculous\u201d. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\u2019s\nevolutionary theories are remembered for suggesting that o\ufb00spring\ncould inherit characteristics that their\nparents had acquired due to the envi-ronment. he classic example is that\nevery generation of baby gira\ufb00es has\nslightly longer and stronger necks because their parents are continuously\nstretching their necks to reach the\nleaves of Acacia trees.\nDismissed if not outright ridiculed\nfor decades, nowadays Lamarckism\nhas made its comeback in the form\nof epigenetics: the study of changes\nin gene expression that don\u2019t alter the\ngenome itself. Such modi\ufb01cations are\nacquired in both childhood and adult-hood, and can be inherited by one\u2019s\nprogeny. As well as occurring naturally in cellular processes, such as regulating the fate of stem cells, epigenetic\nchanges to the genome can be caused\nby environmental factors.\nWith the understanding that variation exists not only at the genomic\nlevel but at the epigenetic level too,\nsome ecologists are beginning to\nspeculate on the roles that epigenetic\ndiversity might play in evolutionary adaptions to the environment.\nIn particular, they speculate that one\nreason that invasive species do so well\nin novel environments is because of\nepigenetics.\nAdaptation needs two things: genetic diversity, and time for bene\ufb01cial mutations to the genome to ac-cumulate. But invasive species are\noften limited in their genetic diversity\nand establish very quickly. Japanese\nknotweed reproduces asexually, thus\nforgoing the high gene variation that\nwe think makes sexual reproduction\nso advantageous. So if they are not\nadapting to the environment via permanent changes to their genome, how\nare they so successful?\nChristina Richards, an evolutionary\necologist at the University of South\nFlorida, thinks that epigenetics is one\nanswer. She has found that Japanese\nknotweed exhibits high epigenetic\ndiversity, with plants possessing different leaf shapes and growing to different heights depending on the environments they inhabit. Invasive house\nsparrows in Kenya also show high\nepigenetic variation between populations in di\ufb00erent environments,\ndespite the limited genetic diversity\nof the sparrows (they are descended\nfrom a single group). Both results\nsupport the idea that genes modi\ufb01ed\nepigenetically by the environment\ncould be passed on, ultimately helping invasive species to gain footholds\nin new areas.\nhe jury is still out: critics are not\nconvinced, arguing that the success of\ninvasive species is explained perfectly\nwell by other reasons supported by\nwell-founded evolutionary theories,\nsuch as expanding into unoccupied\nniches where they can thrive despite\nlimited genetic diversity. But research into ecological and evolutionary epigenetics seems set to take o\ufb00\nas obstacles like the limited number\nof sequenced wild plant and animal\ngenomes are overcome by decreasing\ncosts.\nhe budding integration of disparate research \ufb01elds investigating\nepigenetic variation and inheritance\nin natural populations, facilitated by\nsymposiums and increased dialogue,\nis likely to lead to several studies that\nwill demonstrate how environmental\nchanges a\ufb00ect gene expression. hese\nstudies will also address the impacts,\nif any, that epigenetics have on the\nevolution of species. Once again, it is\nan exciting time for evolutionary biol-ogy.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature.2013.12179\nP. mexicana doing it\u2019s best \u201ccome-hither\u201d\nglance- coupled with some fish-on-fish action\nhttp://www.aquaportail.com/fiche-poisson-1620-poecilia-mexicana.html\n\n"

    "content": "S\nince 2009, after the release\nof 21st Century Breakdown, news surrounding\nGreen Day was few and\nfar between. However the\namerican punk band has now not\nonly released a set of albums, but the\ntrio has now also become a quartet.\nhe newest member of the group,\nthat brought among others American\nIdiot, has added Jason White to their\nranks. he guitarist who has toured\nwith Green Day on several occasions,\nand can be heard on previous albums,\nhas now officially been credited as being a band-member. If this will have\nan impact on the future music that\nthey will release remains to be seen.\nNow to the meat of the article, the\nactual review of the album. \u00a1Uno!, in\ncontrast to the previous album, is\na bit more back to roots for Green\nDay, relying on a more punky theme.\nhis album is akin more to Dookie or\nAmerican Idiot more than 21st CentuMUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\n24\nAMS album of the week\nYo La Tengo are not the sort of band you\ncan pigeonhole. Their albums are a mishmash of genres from across the alternative\nrock spectrum and beyond. Their latest ef-fort, Fade, is slightly less of a mixed bag.\nAll of the standard sounds are here, but\nthey don\u2019t get their own tracks any more.\nThere are no songs here that are primarily\nshoegaze or psychedelic or folk. The vast\nmajority of the album is indie pop with\nshoegaze or psychedelic or folk influences.\nThe tracks not only stand up individually,\nbut they also all work as a coherent body as well. It\u2019s an interesting change\nand one I\u2019m not 100% about.\nThe tracks themselves are generally pretty great. \u2018Ohm\u2019 is a Pavement\ntrack slowly drowning under more and more layers of fuzzy distortion, and\nit\u2019s as good as it sounds. \u2018Is That Enough\u2019 is YLT\u2019s take on Tindersticks-esque\nchamber pop and it is one of my favourite tracks of recent months. \u2018Well You\nBetter\u2019 sounds a bit like Eels meets the Housemartins and they have a fairly\nsubdued evening together, but it\u2019s better than it sounds. \u2018Paddle Forward\u2019 is\na fairly standard 90s indie track (think Guided by Voices / Sebadoh), but it\u2019s\na fairly good one. \u2018Stupid Things\u2019 is the sort of thing I think Youth Lagoon\nwould sound like as a full band, and it makes me really want Youth Lagoon to\nstart being a full band. \u2018I\u2019ll Be Around\u2019 is beautiful, understated and subtle.\nThe delivery of the line \u2018and I still miss you at times\u2019 is probably the closest\nYLT will ever come to making a grown man cry.\nThis is a really good album. Come the end of the year this will probably be in\nmy top 10 and it\u2019ll be getting a lot more listens over the next few weeks. I just\nhave one problem with it. About halfway through you do really start craving\na huge fucking noise track. Yo La Tengo\u2019s classic albums work because of the\ncontrasting tracks, not despite them. The whole point was that it didn\u2019t blend\ntogether \u2013 it was supposed to surprise and excite and challenge. Fade all feels\na bit safe, a bit, dare I say it, boring. It\u2019s the sort of album I\u2019ll put on when I\u2019m\ndoing something else, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit in a darkened room and\nlisten to this in the same way I can with I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One.\n\u00a1Uno! \u00a1Dos! \u00a1Tres!\nMax Eggl reviews the first of a trilogy of new Green Day albums\nry Breakdown. It was released on the\n21st of September of last year. One\nof three singles released prior to the\nalbums was the song \u2018Oh Love\u2019, and\nthis song perfectly summarises the\nrest of the album. Well-placed power-chords, good lyrics, catchy tune and a\nsolo that ain\u2019t half bad (albeit somewhat short) that all mesh together to\nform quite a addictive song. However,\nif you are looking for slow/sad type\nsongs this is the wrong album for you;\nthere\u2019s not one ballad on this album,\nwith \u2018Sweet 16\u2019 being the closest you\nget. Although some may be dismayed\nat the lack of \u201csadness\u201d to wallow in,\nthe album is still very well balanced\nwith each high-powered song adding\nsomething di\ufb00erent, and it thus does\nnot feel repetitive at all.\nRather than bore you by describing each and every song, I prefer to\ndescribe to you what I feel are the\nmain songs that de\ufb01ne this album and\nhopefully you will agree with me on\nthis. When listening to the CD, \u2018Nuclear Family\u2019 will be the \ufb01rst song\nyou encounter, and therefore it must\ndeliver a punch to make you want to\nkeep listening. For me it certainly did\nthat. It may not be the best song of\n\u00a1Uno!, but it draws you in with lyrics\nthat I had in my head the rest of the\nday. Furthermore the collaboration\nof White and Armstrong is apparent\nnot only in the exquisite solo; the following verse sent a shiver down my\nspine. he most popular song of the\nalbum, named as part of Zane Lowe\u2019s\nHottest Tracks of 2012, is \u2018Kill the\nDJ\u2019, although this may have more to\ndo with the profanity in it more than\nanything else! Looking past the occasional swear word, this is actually\na very well crafted song. Armstrong\u2019s\nvocals in this song are outstanding,\npowering above the superb bass line,\nwhich gives this piece a di\ufb00erent feel\nfrom what Green Day usually delivers,\nyet does not fail to impress. his may\nbe a better explanation why this song\nis quite such a hit. he last song that\nI really believe de\ufb01nes \u00a1Uno! is \u2018Troublemaker\u2019. If you are a self-proclaimed\npunk rock enthusiast, then I hope for\nyour sake that you cried out \u201cHey,\nI\u2019ve heard that title before\u201d. If you did utter\n(or think) those words,\nthen I congratulate you\nand answer, yes, dear\nreader, Weezer did\nwrite a very good as\nwell as successful song\nof the same name (also\nOlly Murs released a\nsong of that name, although I hope for your\nsake you didn\u2019t think of\nthat). Sadly the Green\nDay song, does not\npack the same amount\nof punch, and the chorus is somewhat lack-ing. Yet the ri\ufb00 of the\nverse describes mischievousness nearly perfectly and the\nsolo is the best of the whole album.\nhis song which certainly is not the\nbest of the album still manages to\nwow me, and it displays the future of\nwhat Green Day may be.\n\u00a1Uno! is a rocky, fast paced album\nwith enough variety to keep it from\nbeing boring, it includes some catchy\nand well written songs that make it a\njoy to listen to. I give it a 4.5/5, with\nthat last point not being included because I am dismayed at the lack of a\nballad, as I believe that is where Green\nDay thrive. All in all I think is a great\nopening for the trio of albums that the\nband released last year. It promises to\nbe a good collection of albums, if this\nopening is anything to judge by. Anyhow if you are a Green Day, or just\na punk fan, this album should be on\nyour shopping list as it is good enough\nto warrant its price. Let\u2019s hope the\nother albums are just as good, \ufb01ngers\ncrossed!\nD-beatReview:Kr\u00f6mosom\u2013LiveForever\nWithin my university life I have had\nfrequent exposure to cybergrind and\nnoisecore, whilst maintaining particular passions for the more punk-routed\npowerviolence and the extreme grind\nstylings of The Gerogerigegege. hat\nsaid, the \ufb01rst thing that struck me\nupon listening to Kr\u00f6mosom was the\nsheer sonic brutality. he second track\non Live Forever, \u2018Bred to Lose\u2019, hits you\nfrom the o\ufb00 with pounding drums so\ndense and fast that, at times, you can\nbarely distinguish them from the mix.\nhis sheer aural madness is produced\nnot by using hundreds of pedals and\na hefty amount of electronics, but\nrather by physical annihilation of their\nsimple instrumental set-up.\nAs is often the case with bands who,\nupon \ufb01rst glance, have an almost unapproachable density and violence\nto their soundscapes, once the initial\nshock wears o\ufb00, rhythms and melodies are so prominent that I question\nwhy I couldn\u2019t initially pick out the\ncatchy punk refrains from under the\nscuzz. It\u2019s really these driving ri\ufb00s and\ndrum lines under the noise that push\nKr\u00f6mosom to so e\ufb00ectively convey\nthe kind of aggression that smashes\nup the party at 5am. Would some pretentious Wire (magazine, not band)\ndevotees argue that it\u2019s immature?\nProbably.

Step into his shoes, walk around in them.\nDon\u2019t forget.\nOn the evening of this coming\nThursday 24th of January we, at Imperial College, will have the honour\nand the privilege to hear the account\nof Mr Yisrael Abelesz, a survivor of\nthe Aushwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, to tell us his experiences\non the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day and answer our ques-tions.\nAuschwitz, \u201chas become a symbol\nof the Holocaust, representing man\u2019s\ninhumanity to man\u201d, as described by\nthe Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.\nIt was the largest of the Nazi killing camps, where approximately 1.1\nmillion men, women and children,\nincluding Jews, gypsies, the handi-capped, homosexuals, Soviet prisoners of war and political dissidents,\nwere killed, out of a total estimate of\n11 million assassinations throughout the Holocaust across Europe at\nthe hands of the Nazis, from 1933 to\n1945.\nHolocaust Memorial Day is a day\nof remembrance held annually on\nthe anniversary of the liberation of\nAuschwitz, by Soviet soldiers. Mr\nYisrael Abelesz was interned as a\nteenager in Auschwitz-Birkenau and\nafter the war, he came to England to\nwork and bring up his family. His\ngrandson is a current student at Imperial College.\nOver six decades after the end of\nWorld War II, two generations have\npassed and the generation that lived\nthrough the Holocaust is dwindling\nin numbers. Why must we listen to\nthem and tell our children about the\natrocities they faced? By listening to\na personal account, behind mere fig-ures, we can be led to empathy and\ntherefore to action, in a world that\nis too often infected by epidemic\napathy. Indeed, as Lithuanian researcher Vladimir Orlov, involved\nwith investigations into the Nazi\nkilling camps in his country recently\npointed out, it is \u201cinsane\u201d that historians remember the names of the\nmurderers, allowing them to live on\nin history, while the victims remain\nanonymous.\nHearing an account first-hand is\nnot the same as reading history that\nhas been watered down. As Professor Dinur, famously said \u201cIf we wish\nto live and bequeath life to our off-spring, if we believe that we are to\npave the way to the future, then we\nmust first of all not forget\u201d. He suggests that witnesses that survived\nensure a certain moral strength and\nwe cannot allow their decreasing\nnumbers to create a moral, cultural\nand educational vacuum, particularly when genocidal ideologies and\nHolocaust denial persist.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s Holocaust\nMemorial Day is \u201cCommunities Together: Build a Bridge\u201d, to remind\nus that the strongest communities\nare those that respect difference\nand create connections, to stop the\nspread of hate in our own time.\nCome and hear an account of a\nsurvivor of the Holocaust, while you\ncan.\nThursday 24th January, 6.00pm,\nRoyal School of Mines, Lecture Theatre G20\nPlease try to RSVP by visiting the\nfacebook page \u201cHolocaust Memorial\nDay \u2013 A Talk and Q&A with Holocaust Survivor Yisrael Abelesz\u201d or\ncontact jsoc@imperial.ac.uk.\nAndrea Levy Writer\nBy listening to\na personal ac-count, behind\nmere figures,\nwe can be led\nto empathy\nThe Holocaust Memorial in Berlin\nExecution wall in Auschwitz I\nMark A.

    "content": "They dreamed a dream: an IMAX experience\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nJohn Park Film Editor\nLes Mis\u00e9rables\nDirector: Tom Hooper\nScreenwriter: William Nicholson\nStarring: Hugh Jackman, Russell\nCrowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda\nSeyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Helena\nBonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen,\nSamantha Barks, Aaron Tveit\nhe BFI IMAX is a strange and wonderful place. Boasting its \u201cbiggest\nscreen in the UK,\u201d it lives up to its\nreputation in giving you a blistering\nheadache should you sit too far for-ward, or a set of splittingly painful\neardrums should you sit too close to\nthe sides where the massive speakers are located. So the lesson here is\nthis: sit as far back as possible \u2013 you\u2019ll\nstill see everything. he screen is really that big. And of course, centre\nseats are recommended. As soon as\nthe adverts go full-size, you almost\nfeel the words and numbers come out\ntowards the audience. here is hardly\nany need for a 3D conversion it seems,\nas everything feels so close and awe-inspiring in the \ufb01rst place. Adding an\nextra dimension and an extra pair of\nglasses would almost certainly have\neveryone crawling to their exits.\nA certain level of hilarity also ensues with a \ufb01lm like Tom Hooper\u2019s\nlatest, Les Mis\u00e9rables, a \ufb01lm adaptation of the worldwide smash-hit\nmusical that\u2019s been going strong\never since its debut in 1986. During\nhis many, many musical sequences,\nespecially ones involving solos with\nhis actors, Hooper is a big fan of taking their close-ups, and using as few\ntakes as possible, focusing solely on\ntheir faces. On the IMAX screen, the\nactors are placed under a microscope.\nEver wondered how many freckles\nEddie Redmayne has on his face? Or\nhow about the number of wrinkles on\nHugh Jackman\u2019s face? Or perhaps the\nskin tone of Anne Hathaway\u2019s? All\nbecomes (far too) clear. It\u2019s not exactly a distraction by any means, but\nan observation that cannot go unno-ticed.\nhat Hooper doesn\u2019t hold a thing\nback further bene\ufb01ts from the IMAX\ntreatment. As prisoners in 1815\nFrance are forced into physical la-bour, there are waves crashing in\naround them, along with the thunderous opening orchestral score, a\nmix that generates nothing but excitement for what lays ahead. Here\nis where we meet Jean Valjean (Jack-man) a thief who stole a loaf of bread\n\u2013 a crime for which he\u2019s served 19\nyears \u2013 5 for the stealing, the rest for\nhis numerous failed escapes. He is \ufb01nally released on parole, with Inspector Javert (Crowe) reminding him of\nhis condition and status. Valjean has\nforever been marked as a convict, and\nwill remain as such for as long as he\nlives.\nBut Valjean decides to reinvent\nhimself, with some very touching help from a kind-hearted priest\n(Colm Wilkinson in his mighty \ufb01ne\ncameo), breaking his parole, and dis-appearing, creating a new identity for\nhimself. he time fast-forwards eight\nyears, and he\u2019s now a well-o\ufb00 mayor\nand factory owner, under an alias. It\nis here he encounters Fantine (Anne\nHathaway), a hard-working single\nmother forced into prostitution to\nprovide for her illegitimate daughter.\nPromising the dying mother to take\ncare of her vulnerable child Cosette\n(the pitch perfect Isabelle Allen),\nValjean is once again forced to go on\nthe run once the persistent Javert \ufb01nally catches up with him.\nWe get another time-jump: this one\nof nine years. Fantine\u2019s daughter Cosette has grown up now (to Seyfried),\nand becomes the subject of passionate desire for Marius (Redmayne),\nan idealistic student revolutionary\nplanning a dangerous demonstration\non the streets of Paris. He too, is the\nsubject of desire for Eponine (Barks).\nIt has a lot to juggle: plenty of meaty\ncharacters and decades of events and\nthemes all expressed through music and the \ufb01lm\u2019s most unique ele-ment, the live-singing of its cast,\nworks massively to its bene\ufb01t. For\nthe sharply tuned musicians amongst\nthe audience, a certain bum notes\nwill most certainly be evident, most\nlikely from a certain Aussie Gladiator\nwhose smooth voice is more suited\nfor singing the blues rather than an\nintense solo (\u2018Stars\u2019). And it may be a\nlittle awkward at times to hear verbal\ndialogue given a musical treatment.\nBut oh the power and emotion it\nadds to the narrative is quite simply\nunmatchable to anything we have\never seen. Take Hathaway\u2019s solo, for\nexample. Forget about Susan Boyle\nand how she blew away everyone during her talent audition. Here, Fantine is a bruised and beaten woman,\nhaving reached the lowest of the low,\nsinging her guts out in Hathaway\u2019s\nheart-wrenchingly beautiful rendition of \u2018I Dreamed a Dream\u2019. You\nmay not like the song \u2013 but seeing\nHathaway (a lock for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) carry the\nsong throughout a single, intimate\nclose-up shot is a hauntingly memorable scene.\nhe closest thing we get to a love\ntriangle is also interestingly explored\nhere; with Seyfried proving she can\nsing a lot more than her ABBA rep-ertoire, comfortably reaching those\ntop notes in her many duets and trios,\nRedmayne has an incredible voice to\nshow o\ufb00, and once you can look past\nhow the actor shakes his face intensely whenever he\u2019s trying to hold on to a\nnote (unintentionally hilarious, this),\nbe blown away as he performs \u2018Empty\nChairs and Empty Tables\u2019. Barks, who\nhad previously played the same role\non stage before, is also excellent in\nher \ufb01lm debut, and her big moment\ncomes in \u2018On My Own\u2019 in which she\ndespairs over her secret crush on\nMarius.\nJackman, previously trained in the\nmusical theatre, takes on his two\nchallenging solos (\u2018Who Am I\u2019 and\n\u2018Bring Him Home\u2019) with gusto and\nutmost intensity for his character \u2013\nhe has \ufb01ght left in him even when the\nuniverse seems to be against him, he\nhas compassion for the poor, he has\nmercy, he has grief, he has guilt, and\nJackman, in a single performance,\nsweepingly embodies all of these\ncharacteristics, most impressively\neven whilst he\u2019s singing a set of dif\ufb01cult tunes.\nAnd of course, the revolution \u2013 you\nknow these students don\u2019t stand a\nchance against the well-orgainsed\nmilitary, but there is something stirring about their cause their \ufb01rm be-liefs. As they sing their hearts out\nwith \u2018Red and Black\u2019 and \u2018Do You\nHear the People Sing?\u2019 the battlelines\nare drawn, and subsequent violence\nensues, ending in shocking tragedy.\nhe scale remains relatively small,\nstaying true to the stage adaptation,\nand feels more intimate because of it.\nWithout an intermission to wipe\nyour tears away, bounce back from all\nthe depressing drama, the 157-min-ute running time can be a challenge\nto sit through. But thank heavens for\nthe henadiers (Cohen, Carter), the\nevil, conning innkeepers who act as\n\u201cguardians\u201d to little Cosette. Cohen\nand Carter are there for the comedic\npurposes only, and it\u2019s sure a welcome addition. heir intermittent\nappearances add some priceless moments where we can forget about all\nthe injustices in the world, and have\na laugh as this outrageous couple go\nabout their business singing \u2018Master\nof the House\u2019. Cohen and Carter do\nwhat they normally do best, providing plenty of wacky comic relief into\na plot that really needs it.\nhere won\u2019t be a dry pair of eyes in\nthe house by the time we get to hear\nthe rousing \ufb01nale, as a magni\ufb01cent\nmusical comes to a close, one with a\nunique approach that will be remembered for years to come. Bravo Tom\nHooper, for thinking that live-singing\nwould be a good idea, and a special\nround of applause to everyone in the\ncast for making it work. As everyone\ncomes together to sing the biggest\nsong of the musical, \u2018One Day More\u2019,\nthere isn\u2019t a better representation of\nwhat excellent teamwork can really\nachieve.\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nvery Christmas for the\npast several years I sit\ndown and I cry. It\u2019s not\nthat I\u2019m sad; it\u2019s an important tradition. Every\nChristmas I sit down and watch It\u2019s A\nWonderful Life and like a predictable\nfool each time I\u2019m blinking back salty\nwater. And it\u2019s not just with this \ufb01lm\n\u2013 name a tear jerker and it\u2019s probably\nworked its magic on me. I even cried\nat Susan Boyle\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent\naudition.\nBut books, now that\u2019s a di\ufb00erent sto-ry. I\u2019m always so much more engaged\nby books. hey can move and inspire.\nI\u2019ve changed countless opinions on\nthe strength of a book I\u2019ve read, and\nfound myself in many more people\u2019s\nshoes than ever I have in \ufb01lms. But a\nbook has yet to win a tear from me.\nPerhaps it\u2019s the lack of soundtrack,\nI\u2019ve just never had a pile of paper get\nthe slightest boo or hoo from me, nev-er-mind both at the same time.\nhat is, until I read Faitheist.\nFaitheist is a memoir from Chris\nStedman, assistant chaplain at the\nHarvard Humanist Chaplaincy. I\u2019ve\nactually known Chris for over two\nyears now, ever since I wrote for his\nblog, Non Prophet Status. But while\nI\u2019ve been following his work since, I\ncan\u2019t claim to know him personally,\nwhich is why reading his memoir feels\nso strange, like I\u2019m peeking into his\ndiary. So why does someone just two\nyears older than me have his memoirs\nout already? It\u2019s because as atheists\nFaitheism: the importance of dialogue\nRory Fenton\nand the religious debate how to engage one another, his is a very important story to tell.\nChris tells the story of how he went\nfrom evangelical Christian to athe-ist. Such a transition could never be\nsmooth but Chris\u2019 was made all the\nrockier by his realisation from his\nearly teens that he is gay. He tells of\nhis struggle to reconcile his sexuality\nwith his faith, a struggle that at \ufb01rst he\nseems to be loosing. He is told that his\nsexuality is a demon inside him trying\nto prise him from God. Unable to accept himself, Chris is driven to despair.\nHe describes how one evening, home\nalone and hating himself for simply\nbeing Chris, he took a sharp kitchen\nknife and locked himself in the family bathroom. Tears and snot smearing\nhis face, he rolled up his left sleeve and\npracticed, slicing through the warm\nair above his living skin, the movement he needed to make to end it all.\nChris is, of course, still with us but\nunlike in It\u2019s a Wonderful Life he had\nno realisation, crouched with his back\nagainst the cold shower tiles, of what\nthe world would miss without him \u2013\nonly the thought that suicide would\nbe yet another black mark against his\nsoul made him step out of that shower\nand replace the knife in its drawer.\nhis is a very powerful moment and,\nyes, it moved me to tears. his book\nand Chris\u2019 life itself could easily, after\nthat episode, have been dedicated to\nvehemently opposing religion in all its\nforms. I for one couldn\u2019t blame him\nyet incredibly the message of the book\nand Chris\u2019 professional life is one of\ntolerance; a call for dialogue, not di-vision, between believer and non-be-liever. Con\ufb01dent now in his atheism,\nChris wishes to use his story to highlight intolerance of all kinds \u2013 and this\nincludes intolerance within the atheist community for the religious. In his\nwork at Harvard, Chris aims to build\nconstructive dialogue with religious\npeople, focusing on shared values and\nmaking genuine, sincere attempts at\nmutual understanding. Chris stresses\nthat the enemy of secularism is not\nreligion but religious extremism. In\ncombatting this extremism, atheists\ncan \ufb01nd many allies among the re-ligious. Indeed, there simply aren\u2019t\nenough of us to achieve a good society on our own. We simply must work\ntogether and Chris believes it is pos-sible.\nIf someone who was driven close to\nsuicide by religiously-inspired homophobia can make peace with religion,\nsurely so too can many atheists. he\nworld is simply too complex to divide\nalong the tribal lines of religious and\natheist, us and them. In making active e\ufb00orts to reach across this faith\ndivide we stand to make not just useful allies in \ufb01ghting the homopho-bia, sexism and anti-science behind\nreligious extremism, we stand too to\nbuild real relationships and gain real\nfriendships. his is Chris\u2019 challenge\nto his readers and I\u2019m with him on it.\nAtheists and religious people have too\nmuch to gain from sincere dialogue to\nwallow in lazy stereotyping. As most\nof us begin to loose the momentum of\nour two week old New Year\u2019s resolu-tions, perhaps atheists at large could\nmake a fresh resolution, to make an\nattempt this year to actively engage a\nreligious person about their beliefs,\nto try to understand where they come\nfrom and see what you might have in\ncommon. You could just be surprised.\nLet the dialogue begin.\nRory tweets as @roryfenton\nE\nGeorge Butcher\nast week Felix published\nan article discussing the\ndi\ufb00erences in workload\nbetween Oxbridge and\nImperial. \u2018Who works\nharder?\u2019 seemed to be the question it\nwas asking. It threw lots of \ufb01gures at\nthe reader and seemed to suggest that\nOxbridge gives students more contact\nhours and was much better value for\nmoney. he comments online erupted.\nImperial\u2019s longer terms were pointed\nout as an explanation for reduced contact times and there were debates on\nthe quality of the course content, particularly amongst the physicists.\nhis all really annoys me. Imperial students seem to be incapable of\ngetting over an Oxbridge rejection.\nThe mother of all inferiority complexes\nL\nImperial is a world-leading university: we should all stop moaning\nabout Oxbridge, says George Butcher\nEveryone seems to complain and be\nall \u201cOh we work so hard,\u201d or \u201cAren\u2019t\nwe so underappreciated?\u201d Or my personal favourite, \u201cPeople don\u2019t \ufb01ll out\nthe NSS properly and league tables are\njust rubbish.\u201d We seem to have a constant \ufb01xation with how hard we supposedly work and an innate bitterness\nat Oxbridge for not letting us in. It\u2019s\nbizarre and no other university is daft\nenough to do it.\nFirstly, everyone thinks they work\nhard. he hours you work are perfectly\ncomparable to the hours many people\nwork in a job. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but nothing\nworth achieving has been easy to do\nso. I don\u2019t know what you want to do\nwith your life, and dare I say it, nor do\nyou. But whatever it is, if you want to\nbe successful at it, you\u2019re going to have\nto work hard to get there. Get used to\nit now.\nSecondly, Imperial is one of the best\nfurther education institutions in the\nworld. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s the third best in\nthe UK. hat\u2019s pretty good. So what\nif Oxford and Cambridge claim spots\none and two, you\u2019re still at a university\nwhich consistently ranks in the top ten\nworld-wide. When you graduate and\ngo looking for a job, nobody is ever going to say, \u201cWe would give you the job,\nbut frankly, we don\u2019t think Imperial is\na serious enough university.\u201d Imperial\u2019s courses are di\ufb00erent to Oxbridge\u2019s\nand this is good. I\u2019ll have di\ufb00erent\nskills and experiences to engineering\ngraduates from there. here is no \u2018gold\nstandard\u2019 on what to do in a course.\nLet\u2019s all take the opportunity to learn\nfrom some of the best in the world and\nnot waste time complaining.\nhere is research to be done on how\ndi\ufb00erent university courses di\ufb00er all\nover the world. Last week\u2019s article\ntried it, but with lots of short comings\nwhich it was frank about. For now\nthough, let\u2019s enjoy our time at Imperial and all its unique qualities. Enjoy\nliving and working in central London\nand take advantage of everything it\ncan o\ufb00er. Write for Felix! Take up a\nsport. Challenge yourself. Don\u2019t be\nobsessed with being \u2018as good as Oxbridge\u2019 because it\u2019s inane and frankly\nit\u2019s boring.\nGeorge tweets as @georgebutcher\nCome at me bro, and\nunderstand where\nI\u2019m coming from\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 FRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nA long term strategist\nTim Arbabzadah interviews the new Pro-Rector (Education)\nDebra Humphris\nTim Arbabzadah: Does your background help you in your current\nrole? Did you gain \u2013 I hate this word\n\u2013 transferrable skills?\nDebra Humphris: It keeps me fairly\ngrounded in what we\u2019re trying to\nachieve. Universities are extraordinary\ninstitutions and Imperial is de\ufb01nitely\none of the best. Not just in terms of\nthe amazing research that we do that\ntransforms peoples lives, but the education and the whole experience that\nequally transforms the lives of our stu-dents. here\u2019s nothing more satisfying\nfor me than seeing students \ufb02ourish.\nWe should give them an outstanding\nexperience, and just set them o\ufb00 to do\namazing things in life and society.\nTA: You\u2019ve only just come in, so I\nguess is one of your aims to start\nmeeting student reps so they know\nthat right up at the top there is\nsomeone that they know?\nDH: Of course, I met with Doug\n[Hunt, Deputy President (Educa-tion] Becky [Lane, Deputy President\n(Welfare)] and Paul [Beaumont, Union President] before I took up post.\nFor me the Student Union is a really\nimportant part of the wider student\nexperience, and how we work in partnership is really matters. As part of my\nbackground research on the College I\nread the 2011 NSS Response, it was a\nreally helpful insight on the issues that\nmatter to our students. Recently I\u2019ve\nworked with Paul and Doug on the\n2012 report. We had some interesting conversations to make sure it\u2019s absolutely accurate, because it wouldn\u2019t\nhelp anybody if it wasn\u2019t accurate. It\u2019s\na really helpful way to focus on the key\nareas where we can enhance the education and student experience, but we\nwon\u2019t be able to do it all at once. he\noutgoing graduates who complete the\nNSS in 2013 might have very di\ufb00erent\nviews from the previous cohorts, but\nthere will always be improvements we\ncan make. My normal modus operan-di is that my job is education and student experience, and therefore I need\nto be close to the student body, listening to their views, being accessible to\nstudents for me is really important.\nTA: Some students may feel a bit\nintimidated talking to a higher up\nperson and attempt to act in a different way around you. Would you\nrather a warts and all portrayal of\nmodern student life?\nDH: I remember at my interview when\nasked about what my style was I said\n\u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d. I would\nrather students felt able to have a very\nstraightforward conversation with me,\nbecause I can\u2019t see the point of doing\nanything otherwise, it\u2019s far better that\nwe\u2019re frank and open with each other.\nTA: What do you think the internet\u2019s role is? Is there a big challenge\nin using the internet e\ufb00ectively\nrather than just because you can?\nDH: here are a number of universities around the world who have taken\nsigni\ufb01cant steps to open up online re-sources. Most notable is Edx started\nby Harvard and MIT with others now\njoining. What I have been exploring\nwith colleagues is that we have\u2019digital\nnatives\u2019 coming through in terms of\nstudents for whom technology is nor-mal. he question now is how then do\nwe combine that in the most e\ufb00ective\nway to enhance the educational ex-perience. I\u2019m also very interested in\nwhere we as Imperial want to position\nourselves in terms of that online com-munity. In February I\u2019m bringing a\ngroup of people together internally as\npart of a strategy development process\nto consider why and what we want to\ndo about this. here\u2019s no doubt we\ncould do more and but \ufb01rst we need to\nbe clear about our strategy for that? I\u2019d\nbe quite keen to explore how we might\nuse some of our online resources to\nbetter encourage young people in\nsecondary schools to engage with\nscience, technology and maths.\nTA: A lot of universities get\nlambasted for not doing\nenough for outreach to get\npeople into university? What\nis the universities place in this?\nOr would you say that the Government unfairly point the blame at\nthe universities for a school system that is their jurisdic-tion?\nDH: With the change\nto tuition fees for\nHome/EU undergraduate students\nthe O\ufb03ce of Fair\nAccess (OFFA)\nhas required us in\nour access agreement to make\nclear how we\nmake additional investment in student support\nand outreach\nactivities. As\ntuition fee\nincome increases so the\ngrant from the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England (HEFCE ) is reducing, So\nwe\u2019re using investing more in out-reach, we can\u2019t do everything so we\nhave to be really quite strategic and\nfocused on what makes a di\ufb00erence.\nhere\u2019s one thing about encouraging young people to consider higher\neducation, but it\u2019s another thing to\nencourage them to apply to Imperial.\nOur outreach team does great work;\nwe\u2019ve got some great developments\nsuch as Reach Out Lab and the number of schools that they engage with.\nWe\u2019re at a point where we probably\nneed to take stock and review where\nwe can most e\ufb00ectively focus our ef-forts.\nTA: At Imperial, Departments are\nquite autonomous. Would you say\nthe way forward is making things\nuniform across all Departments?\nOr is it a better approach to look at\ndepartments individually?\nDH: Well in terms of education we\nalso have to operate within the framework of the Quality Assurance Agency Quality Code, and one of the issues\nthis raises is how we ensure parity of\nexperience. here will be disciplinary\ndi\ufb00erences: chemistry\nis not the same\nas mechanical\nengineering.\nWhere we\u2019ve\nmade a commitment to\nstudents in\nour quality\nframework and\nin our regulations we need to\nensure we deliver\nour commitments.\nFeedback has always been the one\nthat people highlight, not just at Imperial. In terms of assessment and\nfeedback I think there\u2019s a bigger issue around what\u2019s feedback, how do\nyou know you\u2019re getting feedback?\nWhat does feedback look like? Helping students understand what that\nreally means. And in terms of assess-ment, I suspect that we need to think\nabout and really understand the purpose of assessment. What does the assessment look like? I would hazard a\nguess that there are areas in which we\nmight be over assessing students for\nwhatever reason. If we really want to\nfocus on assessment and feedback we\nneed to think about what constitutes\nassessment. When do we need to as-sess? What are we assessing in terms\nof the learning outcomes for particular courses?\nTA: he di\ufb03culty, in my view, with\nmaking everything standardised\ninvolves chasing up and ensuring\nevery lecturer does something to a\nperfect standard?\nDH: In reality there is variation in all\nthings, we are all somewhere in a range\nin a distribution curve. But I go back\nto the point that it\u2019s about being clear\nabout what feedback is and signalling\nthat very clearly to students. If we\u2019ve\nmade a promise about when we\u2019ll give\nyou feedback then we need to keep\nour promises. Still there\u2019s a bigger issue about what is assessment, how are\nwe assessing, what assessment do we\nactually need to do. here\u2019s a bigger\npiece of work to do on this.\nTA: Are these sorts of issues that\nyou\u2019re taking a back to square one\napproach, rather than building on\ncurrent framework? Maybe think-ing: perhaps let\u2019s dismantle and put\nthe framework back together again?\nDH: With the support of the Management Board in the next 6 months I\u2019ll\nbe taking forward a process to refresh and re\ufb01ne an education and\nstudent experience strategy. here\nwill be a range of provocations\nthat will invite students and sta\ufb00\nto contribute going to a whole set\nof elements that should shape our\nstrategy. his has to build upon the\ngreat education and experience we\no\ufb00er and to take it further. As part\nof the process I\u2019ll be encouraging us\nall to look up and out to consider\nbest practice from across the globe.\nOnce we\u2019ve decided what we want to\ndo it strikes me that Imperial will do\nit with gusto!\nMy strategy is to take forward a\nconversation across the College to\ndevelop a strategy that engages the\ngenius of the sta\ufb00 and students in the\nCollege. he focus is the education\nand wider student experience and\neverybody should have a voice in this\nprocess.\nTA: Last question. So would you say\nthat the educational experience of\na student can improve a student\u2019s\nsatisfaction and welfare as a whole?\nDo you think the educational experience is a stem to their general enjoyment of university?\nDH: Well, students fundamentally\ncome to the university to take part in\nan educational experience to receive\nan award from the institution. hat\u2019s\nnot just the educational experience; it\nincluded the wider support that is in\nplace: the accommodation, the cater-ing, the sports and recreation, vol-unteering, careers advice, disability\nservice etc. here are a whole range\nof elements that are there to support\nand help students to not just on their\nprogramme but in the wider experience as a student. I\u2019m interested in\nthe rounded genius of our students,\nbecause it\u2019s more than just their pro-gramme. It\u2019s the students that take\npart in volunteering, get involved in\noutreach in schools, sports, fund raising and the other elements. hat\u2019s the\nrounded genius of our students and I\nreally like to work with the Union and\nstudents to \ufb01nd a way to further enhance such opportunities.\nBackground\nDidn\u2019t go to university\nTrained as a nurse\nQualified as a nurse educator\nDid part time masters while working\nfull time\nSpotted and recruited for a regional\nhealth authority\nHeld various jobs at the Department of\nHealth\nPhD at George\u2019s Medical School\nRecruited by University of\nSouthampton\nWorked on \u201cbig curriculum change\naround interprofessional education,\nhealth, and social care\u201d called New\nGeneration Project\nAppointed Pro-Vice Chancellor (Edu-cation & Student Experience)\nAppointed Pro-Rector (Education) at\nImperial College London\n...Makes big impact at Imperial?\n\n"

We were out\nto get them, as earlier in the season\nthey had beaten us by a fair few goals\nto very few in return.\nRUMS pressed hard from the start\nand soon after the match began were\nawarded a penalty corner, but solid\ndefending from Celia, Maria, Emma\nand Kirsty meant we cleared the ball\neasily. Play continued with some\ngood linking passes up the right\nwing to Hazman, resulting in short\ncorners for us, although we were\nunable to convert. Sorcha was on\na roll as she continuously took the\nball and dribbled past their defend-ers, and great play from Kathryn and\nAnna up front meant we had lots of\nshots and a few near misses on goal.\nWe worked hard to keep the ball in\nour possession and in our half of the\npitch.\nThe goal came just before half\ntime, when an unmarked Bryony saw\na space in the D and ran in. The ball\nwas passed back to Celia who sent it\nin and a deflection from Bryony put\nthe ball through the keepers\u2019 legs\nand into the back of the goal. Textbook finish. We were 1-0 up.\nAfter half time, we knew RUMS\nwould be out to attack, but man\nmarking of their key player meant\nthey got more and more frustrated\nand the ball didn\u2019t get through. Defenders Kirsty and Emma kept strong\nto prevent their forwards from having chances to score, and beautiful distribution from Celia at the\nback meant we had more and more\nchances at their end of the pitch.\nBreakaways in the second half\nmeant that Kathryn had some one-on-one situations with the goalie\nand close chances on goal. We had\nour captain Gigi back for the last 15\nminutes of the game, who worked\nwell linking passes down the right\nwith Maria and Hazman, but strong\ndefending from the RUMS side\nmeant our chances were saved.\nWith great play from the whole\nteam, the final score was 1-0. Hopefully our winning streak will continue this term, and more goals will be\nscored. Good luck ladies!\nHockey Womens 1\u2019s win again\nBryony Halcrow Sports Writer\nWhat is Wing Chun?\nWing Chun is a close quarters hand\nto hand combat system developed in\nSouthern China which has recently\ngained popularity due to the martial arts \ufb01lm Ip Man released in 2008\nwhich is loosely based on the life of\nthe late grand master Ip Man. Wing\nChun has also been made famous by\nBruce lee, who studied Wing Chun as\na direct disciple of Ip Man, Lee took\nmany of the principles and concepts\nbehind the martial art into developing\nhis own combat system Jeet Kune Do\n(JKD).\nClasses\nAt Imperial College Wing Chun classes are run under the direction of Sifu\nAndrew Sofos and the Imperial College Wing Chun Society. Sifu Andrew\nhas been running classes at Imperial for 26 years. During class students\nwork towards a grading system set out\nby Sifu Andrews martial arts academy\nbased in north London. Several of our\nstudents just completed their Level 1\ngrading over Christmas time, and a\nbig congratulations are in order to all\nof them. Classes start with a quick but\nintense warm-up, training of the basic stance, punches and kicks before\nmoving on to learn some basic practical self-defence techniques. More traditional aspects of the martial art are\nalso taught including the \ufb01rst form Sil\nNim Tau, and at later ranks, Chi Sao\u2019s\n(Sticky hand exercises) which are used\nto train Wing Chun practitioners\u2019 reactions and condition the arms.

    "content": "SPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\n38\nWandering the Lake District\nDay 1: The Journey\nAt the usual time of 17:30hrs, ten\nFellwanderers met at the Union to\nembark upon the annual Winter\nTour, this year to the Lake District.\nAfter introductions, Matt and Ping\non their \ufb01rst trip, discussion immediately turned to the anticipated\nfreezing conditions \u2014 photos from\nthe 2010 tour had been circulating\nand did not inspire con\ufb01dence. An\ne\ufb03cient packing of the minibus (in-cluding walking axes) meant we were\nsoon heading north through Hyde\nPark.\nFortunately, the London tra\ufb03c\ndidn\u2019t prove too tortuous so we made\ngood time along the M1. A supermarket stop near Birmingham allowed one vital aspect of the trip to\nbe sourced \u2014 food! An ambitious 20\nminute target to be back in the bus\nwas not met but soon enough we\nwere motoring north again. Approximately \ufb01ve hours later, the minibus\narrived at hirlmere Recreation Hall,\ncomplete with Christmas tree, where\nwe would be staying for the trip.\nhe hall was reassuringly \u2014 not to\nmention surprisingly \u2014 warm so after unpacking the bus and sorting out\nthe food, roll mats and sleeping bags\nwere out and everyone bedded down\nfor the night.\nDay 2: Rain\nTo all those who have been on many\nFellwanderers trips and su\ufb00ered at\nthe hands of the spreadless cheese\nand pickle sandwich, Saturday was\na dream come true. In the lunch-preparation room, we found Claire\ncutting into a large joint of ham and\nbutter on the table along with thick,\nseeded white bread.\nSandwiches made and fully water-proofed, we headed out into the rain\nsurprised by the relative warmth of\nthe morning. he walk started from\nthe hall bearing due east through\nthe Stair Wood and onto the ridge\ncontaining Wainwright\u2019s High Tove\n(515m), Ambroth Fell (479m), High\nSeat (608m), and Bleaberry Fell\n(590m).\nhe going was fairly easy without\nmuch steep ascent but due to the recent heavy rain we feared spending\nthe whole day walking through deep\nbogs. Fortunately, and to the intrigue\nof many, the bogs were mostly frozen\ngiving the strange sensation of walking on something that should be soft\nbut is actually solid. Despite having\ntwo large lakes on either side of the\nridge (Derwent Water and hirlmere\nto the east and west, respectively)\ngood views were few and far between\nas visibility was severely limited by\nlow cloud cover and mist in the val-leys.\nhe circular(ish) walk ended back\nat the hall just at the sun was going down. Dinner preparations were\nquickly underway for James\u2019 goulash\nwith dumplings. he recipe had been\nattempted on a previous trip and\nturned out partically sucessful \u2014 the\npitfall being the lack of scone-baking\nexperience in the group. his time,\nthere was no such trouble with Sarah in charge of dumping-making so,\nneedless to say we ate heartily leaving just enough room for a bread and\nbutter pudding.\nDay 3: Wainwrights\nSunday promised a long walk, navigated by Tom, to include ten Wainwrights in the North Western Fells \u2014\nwe knew this was going to be tough so\nstarted with a cooked English break-fast. After a short drive from the hall\nto Braithwaite we found ourselves\nascending steeply onto a horseshoe-ridge, with eight of the peaks to be\nclimbed during the day. Before too\nlong the ascent was complete to take\nus onto Grisedale Pike (791m) and\ngreat views of the adjacent Whinlatter Forrest Park as well as the rest of\nMark Bruggemann Sports Writer\nthe, mostly snow-topped, route.\nWe then continued along the \ufb01rst\nstretch of the ridge to bag Hopegill\nHead (770m) and Whiteside (707m),\nthe latter providing an excellent view\nof Crummock Water. We then lost\na lot height moving along the toe of\nthe ridgeline followed by another\nsteep ascent up to Grasmoor (852m).\nUnfortunately, at this height we were\nwell and truly within the clouds,\nagain restricting visibility but not\ndampening spirits. Continuing along\nthis branch of the horseshoe we ascended Crag Hill (837m) and, with\nthe sun low in the sky, Sail (773m).\nWhile coming down from Sail the\npath forked \u2014 one prong going down\ninto the valley and the other continuing along the ridge. It was beginning\nto get dark (entre chien et loup we\nwere told the French say) so this was\nthe decision point: head back to the\nbus or carry on to two more Wainwrights? We agreed we had enough\nlight to safely bag Scar Crags (672m)\nand Causey Pike (637m) so quickly\nmade tracks. Many of the surrounding villages were illuminated by their\nstreet lights which made for a pretty\nlandscape despite the low light levels.\nhe walk between Causey Pike into\nthe valley felt very peaceful and we\nhad just enough daylight to ascend\nour \ufb01nal Wainwright of the day, Outside (568m). Unfortunately it was\ntoo dark to attempt Barrow (455m)\nso we proceeded, now in complete\ndarkness, with our headtorches on\ntowards the lights of Braithwaite to\ncollect the minibus.\nWe arrived back at the hall at about\nsix o\u2019clock shattered, having ascended 1600m during the course of the\nday.\nDay 4: Rest or Run\nMonday morning o\ufb00ered a simple\nchoice \u2014 a gentle walk to recover\nfrom the previous day or to run\n23miles over 11 Wainwrights. Sensibly the vast majority of the group\nchose the former and headed o\ufb00 towards Conniston Water, dropping o\ufb00\nthe runners along the way. his is the\nlast we would see of them until the\nevening.\nAfter the walk we drove into Keswick where the group further split\ninto those who fancied an afternoon\nshopping and tea drinking, and those\nwho fancied a quick lap of Derwent\nWater. After stocking up with additional supplies the two groups made\ntheir way back to the hall to prepare\nthe much anticipated roast dinner.\nAt about six thirty Jack and Charlie returned from their run covering Glaramara (783m), Allen Crags\n(785m), Great End (910m), Esk Pike\n(885m), Bowfell (902m), Rossett\nPike (651m), Pike of Stickle (709m),\nLoft Crag (680m), hunacar Knott\n(723m), and High Raise, (802m) so\nwere unusually quiet for the rest of\nthe evening! he roast beef with all\nthe trimmings, including chestnuts,\nwas served soon after and certainly\nlived up to expectation and left us all\nimmobile once the Christmas pudding had also been demolished.\nDay 5: Views and Singing\nTuesday morning started with a\ndrive to a car park near Conniston\nto tackle another \ufb01ve Wainwrights in\nthe Southern Fells. he walk started\nwith a steep ascent with scrambling\nsections \u2014 the pinnacle set the tone\nfor the rest the day. he sky was near\ncloudless providing stunning views\nof Morecambe bay in one direction\nand snow capped peaks in the other.\nStrangely, the snow on the fells made\nthem seem much larger and more\ndramatic, more akin to an Alpine en-vironment, than they actually are.\nhe route followed another ridge\naround Levers Water and Low Water.\nhe going was mostly good though\nvery undulating meaning the day\nwas characterised by lots of ascent.\nFirst, and after many false summits,\nwe were up Weatherlam (763m) and\nstopped for lunch in the sun \u2014 a rarity this year and made all the sweeter\nby roast beef sandwiches! Taking\nevery opportunity to skate on the\nfrozen lakes, we made our way towards Swirl How (802m) followed by\nBrim Fell (796m) and he Old Man of\nConniston (803m). Here, it was possible to see both Snowdon, despite\nit being over 100miles away, and the\nIsle Of Man.\nOn the way to the \ufb01nal Wainwright\nof the day, Dow Crag (778m), the\nsun started to go down. he reddish-orange sky across the sea was magni\ufb01cent with the lights on the Isle of\nMan looking as though the sea were\non \ufb01re. he o\ufb00shore windfarm only\nadded to the picture. We descended\ndown an old quarry road looking\ninto this scenery which, I think, had\na calming e\ufb00ect on us all.\nTaa was in charge of the evening\u2019s\ndinner: a delicious hai Green Curry. Just after dinner the village carol\nsingers knocked on the hall door. We,\nof course, let them in and requested\n\u201cOh Come All Ye Faithful\u201d followed\nby \u201cGood King Wenceslas\u201d and sang\nalong with zest! It seemed a \ufb01tting\nevent for our last night in the Lakes\nand left those from cities and abroad\nslightly bemused.\nShe\u2019ll be coming round the\nmountain when she comes...\nIt looks cold. Apart from Pink\nHat Man; he looks snuggly.\nSorry, what about wandering fells is fun?\nBleak, wet, cold... only one smile among them!\n\n"

Measure rice as per the instructions in the \u201cCarbs\u201d section,\ndepending on how many you\u2019re serving or how many portions you\u2019re planning\non making ahead. We don\u2019t advocate making a massive pot, though; a 4-person\nserving is much easier to control evenly during the cooking process.\nWash rice to remove excess starch and any nasties like talc that were used while\nprocessing, then drain and pop into a decent non-stick pan with a lid. Add water in a 1:(1.5-2) ratio, so for every 1 cup of rice you\u2019re using about 1.5 to 2 cups\nof water. Stick it on the boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and let it simmer,\ncovered. Resist the urge to stir because you\u2019ll otherwise just destroy the rice\nand make it all mushy.\nAfter 20-25 minutes (or until most of the water has been absorbed), take it\noff the heat (don\u2019t take the lid off!) and let stand for 5-10 minutes on a damp\ntea towel. Fluff up with a fork, and then serve/pack into your bento box/por-tion up for freezing.\nProtip: If you\u2019ve got extra time to kill, feel free to soak the rice post-wash for\nabout 30 minutes - this seems to make it fluffier and easier to separate.

You can easily use lettuce leaves,\nor silicone muffin cups like I\u2019ve done\nabove to keep di\ufb00erent food \ufb02avours\nfrom mingling; but if built-in dividers\nare more your thing, go ahead.\nA proper Japanese bento lunch is\nactually meant to be eaten at room\nContainers temperature (gasp!), which is NOT\na problem given our current cool\nweather, and assuming the proteins are\nfully cooked \u2013 no medium-rare steak\nbites, I\u2019m afraid. But if you want your\nfood above that temperature, you can\nlook at thermal lunch containers if you\ndon\u2019t have a microwave, though they\u2019re\npricier and bulkier. Alternatively, just\nmake sure your regular container\u2019s\nnuke-friendly or pop it into an insulated lunch bag if it\u2019s only going to be a\nfew hours and you don\u2019t mind it being\nscalding hot.\nOne thing I \ufb01nd about thermal con-tainers: they\u2019re perfect for soups (see\nour Lunchbox #01 issue), but not all\nfoods stand up well in them \u2013 main\nreason being that food WILL carry on\ncooking in residual heat. You\u2019d be \ufb01ne\nwith a stew or curry (or anything that\u2019s\n\ufb01ne with slow cooking), and maybe\ncertain grains (rice!); but steamed veg-gies, pasta and certain meats will just\nlook sorry, taste gooey and get bone\ndry respectively.\nEditor\u2019s Picks: Lock & Lock 550ml con-tainer, \u00a36.64 from Amazon; Glit & Brillia Bento Lunchbox with Belts, \u00a34.75\nfrom japancentre.com\nBento box with a mini cereal\nbox for size comparison\nSure, the carb of choice for Asian bentos happens to be rice; but like mentioned before it doesn\u2019t *have* to be.\nI\u2019ve had bentos with couscous, braised\npotatoes and quinoa and they came\nout just as yummy. hat said, if you\u2019re\nusing rice, you don\u2019t have to wake up\nat the crack of dawn to prepare it. I alternate between setting the timer on\nmy rice cooker the night before so I\nhave fresh rice in the morning, or defrosting pre-cooked frozen rice in the\nmicrowave.\nhe Japanese (and myself) are partial to short grain rice that sticks a bit\nwhen cooked, but I\u2019m not fussy \u2013 a\ndecent basmati or jasmine rice works\njust as well. Whatever you do, don\u2019t\nuse the easy cook stu\ufb00; it isn\u2019t as palatable whether hot or at room temp, and\nthe extra time taken to prepare non-easy-cook rice pays o\ufb00 plenty in taste.\nIn the event you\u2019ve scratched your\nCarbs head (or the bottom of pan) plenty\nof times while trying to cook rice,\nI\u2019ve provided a method below \u2013 rice\ncooker optional. Remember the cardinal rule of Asians: don\u2019t measure rice\nby weight; do it by volume. We usually\nuse the small cups that come with rice\ncookers; but one regular co\ufb00ee mug\nwill cook up two hearty portions depending on your appetite.\nIt\u2019s funny, but in Asia leaner cuts like\nchicken breast sell for much cheaper\nthan the slightly tougher but more\n\ufb02avoursome (and more in-demand)\nthigh/leg meat, which is the reverse of\nwhat chicken prices are like here in the\nUK. Asians have the last laugh though:\ndarker meat tastes better at room temperature and can withstand reheating\nbetter without turning Sahara-esque,\neven sans the sinful skin.\nWhatever cut you choose is totally up\nto you, though if you\u2019re not using leftovers and will be prepping the meat\ndish in the morning, chances are you\u2019ll\nbe stir-frying it \u2013 so you need something that\u2019s quick to cook but won\u2019t\ndry out over time.\nIn that case, I \ufb01nd chicken leg/thigh,\npork shoulder, or \ufb02ank from beef (cut\nagainst the grain) work well. Just cut\nthem into thin strips to save on cooking time. You can tenderize tougher\nand cheaper cuts than these if you\nprep them the night before in marinade \u2013 all you have to do in the morning is fry! Done right, you should only\nneed perhaps 5-10 minutes to fry your\nmeat, plus maybe a few more minutes\nto pack into your box and let cool.\nIf you plan on making a slow-cooked\nstew for dinner, why not make an extra portion seeing as it takes the same\namount of e\ufb00ort? You can reheat, pop\ninto your bento and serve it with your\nother side dishes. the next day.\nleftovers. Done right, you can streamline the cooking/assembly process\ninto 20 minutes or less.\nTo the right is a bento I prepared\nsome time ago, which I\u2019ll deconstruct\ninto its components below. his is\nwhat we\u2019d call an Asian bento, mainly\nbecause the main carb component/\nstaple here is rice. Of course, I\u2019ve\nsince been able to \ufb01t other grains in\nthat slim Japanese bento box (namely\ncouscous and quinoa) with other sides\n\u2013 the possibilities are endless.\nFluffy stovetop rice\nProteins\n\n"

LET\u2019S SUE THEM YEAH\nUgandan pygmy tribe display flexible footwork skills\nNick Kennedy Science Writer\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\n14\nhether it was using sand, sundials or swinging pendulums,\nhumans have\nstrived to create more e\ufb03cient time\nkeeping devices. he past century saw\na large jump with the introduction\nof the atomic clock. Current models\noperate by measuring the microwave\nenergy signature of electrons dropping between energy levels. hese are\nremarkably precise with errors as little as 1 part in 1017, which equates\nto dropping a second every 3 billion\nyears or so.\nSince the metric system was de\ufb01ned\n(later superseded by the International System of Units), physicist have\nsought ever more precise methods\nto determine the standard weights\nand measures. For example, the metre was \ufb01rst de\ufb01ned as a fraction of\nthe meridian line on the Earth \u2013 a\nvery physical and tangible measure.\nWith the aim of improving accuracy,\nhowever, it was generally adopted to\nde\ufb01ne the base units in terms of important physical constants, which are\nmore resolute and rigid. his had led\nto the metre being de\ufb01ned as a fraction of the speed of light. he second\nis measured by the radiation emitted\nfrom electron shell transitions of a\n\ufb01xed, duplicable atom. All the other SI\nunits are de\ufb01ned this way, apart from\nthe kilogram, which is de\ufb01ned only in\nterms of a prototype platinum-iridium\nrod kept in France.\nA research experiment by a team\nfrom the University of California,\nBerkeley, intended to produce accurate atomic clocks, and could now also\nbe used to re\ufb01ne the de\ufb01nition of the\nkilogram. Based on Arthur Compton\u2019s\nidea that photons deliver kinetic energy to electrons and alter their momen-tum, and Louis de Broglie\u2019s theory that\nmoving electrons can be thought of as\nwaves, the new atomic clock works by\nmeasuring the Compton frequency of\natoms.\nCharacteristic Compton frequencies are used: around 1020 Hz for\nelectron-waves, and 3 \u00d7 1025 Hz for\na caesium atom. An ultra-precise laser is used to deliver \ufb01xed impact\npulses to half a sample of caesium\natoms, with the e\ufb00ect of slowing the\nCompton frequency. By combining\nthe pulsed sample with the original\nhalf and using atom interferometry to\nmeasure their interaction. When the\nsamples separate to a multiple of the\nCompton frequency, the output of the\ninterferometer is high. he frequency\nof the \ufb01xed impact pulses is then the\nfrequency of the atomic clock.\nhough the new atomic clock is only\naccurate to 4 parts per billion, Holger\nM\u00fcller, leader of the research team,\nstates that \u201cit\u2019s no better than the\noriginal atomic clocks 50 years ago.\nBut who knows what we could achieve\nwith \ufb01ve decades of improvement.\u201d\nWhat is di\ufb00erent about this experiment is that other atomic clocks are\ndependent on several parameters of\nthe system, such as spin of electrons\nand its interaction with the nucleus.\nhese are not always fundamental\nand could be improved. Additionally,\nthey require at least two atoms, one\nfor reference, while this design could\nbe adapted to work with single atoms\nand high-precision lasers.\nNevertheless, there is criticism of\nthe research. Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, winner of the 1997 Nobel\nPrize, is not satis\ufb01ed with the \ufb01ndings and what is claimed from them:\ntheir paper \u201creports a measurement\nof the recoil frequency, but this recoil\ne\ufb00ect has been known for decades.\nAny atomic clock involves masses. But\nnowhere in their experiment, does a\nreal Compton oscillator at 1025 Hz\nappear!\u201d While the debate continues,\nother physicists are at least interested\nin the possibilities mentioned.\nDOI:10.1038/nature.2013.12191\nScientists from Dartmouth College,\nHanover, recently focused on the an-kle-flexibility of pygmy populations\nin Uganda. hey \ufb01lmed the honey-gathering behaviour of pygmies to\nmeasure the flexibility of their ankle\njoints.\nhe \ufb01ndings, reported in he Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences, show that pygmy hunter-gatherers have extraordinarily flexible\nankles. his enables them to climb up\ntrees with their shins almost touching the trunk, like a chimpanzee. If\na person unaccustomed to climbing\nbent their foot to such extremes, they\nwould su\ufb00er severe damage.\nhe team used ultrasound to compare the length of leg muscle \ufb01bres\nin the Twa of Uganda, a pygmy tribe,\nwith those found in the Bakiga, Ugandan farmers who seldom climb trees.\nhey found that the \ufb01bres running\nalongside the shin bone were much\nlonger in the Twa.\nhe pygmy climb trees mainly to\ncollect honey, a vital component of\ntheir diet and an indicator of social\nprestige.

Well, it\u2019s not so much a\nrecipe as it was me throwing in a bunch of random seasonings with the meat\nin the spirit of true old Asian cooking when everything was done in pinches\nof X and splashes of Y. Experience and tasting your wares will mean you\u2019ll get\nbetter with time.\n1 chicken breast/up to 2 de-boned chicken legs\nLight soy sauce\nSesame oil\nCornstarch\nShaoxing Wine - optional\nDiced garlic - use however much you feel like\nCut your meat into thin strips, and bung them in a bowl with two tablespoons\nof light soy sauce, a drizzle of sesame oil, and a bit of cornstarch. Amounts can\nbe adjusted \u2013 you can always add more! Leave to marinade overnight in the\nfridge, and in the morning, chuck them in a hot frying pan that\u2019s already had\nabout 2 tablespoons of oil and some chopped garlic in it. Stir-fry until almost\ncooked through (clear juices + no trace of pink in the meat), deglaze with some\nShaoxing wine (optional) and boil off. Serve up or pack in box.\nProtip: Feel free to add other veggies or seasonings which you think would fit.\n[Spring] onions would work well.\nIf there\u2019s something that even the best\nmeat can\u2019t do, it\u2019s to add a touch of\nvibrant colour to the resulting bento.\nhankfully this is managed by eggs,\nwhich are quick to whip up in a wide\nvariety of ways.\nIf you\u2019re health conscious, slices of\nhard boiled eggs add interest without the grease. For those among you\nwho are suckers for cutesy stu\ufb00, some\nboiled quail eggs would probably be\nup your alley.\nPersonally, I have three favourite\nways to cook eggs for bento. One is\nin the traditional Japanese style called\n\u201ctamagoyaki\u201d, a rolled omelette which\nis a staple in their cuisine \u2013 you\u2019ll\nprobably have seen slices or strips of it\nwhen dining in a Japanese restaurant.\nUnfortunately I haven\u2019t quite mastered\nit yet, so I tend to fall back on the egg\n\u201cmince\u201d (\u201ciri tamago/tamago soboro\u201d)\nyou see here. You\u2019d be right in thinking that it\u2019s scrambled egg gone past\nthe \u201ccreamy\u201d stage, but it\u2019s an Asian\nfavourite sans no cream/milk/butter.\nhe recipe is provided below.\nMy \ufb01nal favourite? Pouring out a\nthin layer of egg on a frying pan, not\nunlike making an omelette. When it\u2019s\ncooked, I remove the circular sheet of\negg and leave to cool on a chopping\nboard, then roll up and cut into \ufb01ne\nshreds. (try garnishing your next noodle dish with this!) One egg, so many\nways.\nhen there\u2019s the token Asian vegetarian protein: tofu. A few slices of\nthe \ufb01rm variety, lightly pan-fried on\nboth sides with a drizzle of soya sauce\n\u2013yum!\nStir as much as you want depending on how \u201cminced\u201d you want the it to be.\nEggs (depending how much you want - don\u2019t go more than 3!)\nLight soy sauce\nDark soy sauce (adds colour, not flavour. OD and you get brown egg.)\nSalt and pepper\nSesame oil\nCornstarch\nHeat up a bit of the oil in a frying pan on medium-high while you lightly combine the eggs with sufficient seasoning (don\u2019t use a heavy hand though!) Pour\nyour egg mix in the pan, and stir as you would scrambled eggs - the only difference being you don\u2019t have to stir as often if you want your \u201cmince\u201d to be a\nbit chunkier like I have in my bento. When you don\u2019t see any wetness, the egg\u2019s\nready for serving or packing.\nProtip: Adding a bit of chopped spring onions to the mix adds a nice pop of\nfresh colour.\nLike it or not, these \u201cbad\u201d boys are\nthe main way you\u2019re going to get your\nlunch to look interesting \u2013 they add\npops of colour (apart from the fact\nthat not having them means you run\nfoul of the 5-a-day gamut.)\nAgain, you can make life easier for\nyourself here. Pre-chop everything\nthe night before \u2013 sometimes I\u2019ll chop\nmore peppers/carrots than I\u2019ll need\nfor the night\u2019s meal and save the extra\nchopped veg for use in my bento the\nnext day.\nWhen time comes to cook them,\nyou\u2019ve got a good arsenal of methods\nat your disposal. Steaming or stir-fry-ing is the best way to retain their nutrients \u2013 I\u2019m biased towards the latter.\nNow, a confession: the mixed veggies in the bento shown came straight\nout of a bag of frozen mixed veg. Before you go after my head, though,\nhear me out \u2013 no one\u2019s saying you\nCAN\u2019T used frozen mixed veg. In fact,\nit\u2019s inherently better than the pre-cut\nnon-frozen as it\u2019s frozen right after\nharvest and cleaning. Of course, I\ndon\u2019t recommend doing it all the time;\nbut it\u2019s perfectly acceptable in a pinch.\nIf you\u2019ve got your veggies all chopped\nready for a stir fry, here\u2019s a simple basic method you can utilize and tweak.\nHeat up a bit of oil in your pan, then\nchuck in a bit of minced garlic before\nadding your veggies in. Put the long-er-cooking stu\ufb00 \ufb01rst; so for instance\ncarrots would go in before pak choi.\nAdd your seasoning while you stir-fry,\ntaste to check, and remove when everything is done. One cardinal rule of\nstir-frying: NEVER overcook \u2013 you\u2019re\ntalking a few minutes, tops!\nNo reason to restrict yourself completely from having them \u2013 the key\nhere is portion control, or using\nhealthier alternatives. Sometimes if\nI\u2019ve baked something like brownies,\nI\u2019ll wrap a small slice and pack it in\ntogether with my bento box. On the\nother hand, my housemates will also\ntestify that I buy clementines like\nthere\u2019s no tomorrow from North End\nRoad market, which is another of my\nfavourite \u201cdesserts\u201d (it\u2019s quite common for Asians to eat fresh fruit at the\nend of a meal in lieu of hot pudding).\nSophia also swears by North End Road\nmarket as well, as that\u2019s where you can\n\ufb01nd other fruits and veggies for dirt\ncheap.\nPacking and safety\nIf you\u2019re using a thermal lunch con-tainer, make sure you preheat it following the manufacturer\u2019s directions\n(boiling water for a few minutes?) and\nthat your food goes in PIPING hot.\nSemi-warm food means that your\nfood will stay at that temperature for\nages, which is a lot better than current\nroom temperature for nasties to grow.\nOtherwise, if you\u2019re using a non-ther-mal box sans dividers, start by packing\nyour rice to one side. Compress it a bit\nwith a moistened spoon, then arrange\nyour other components to \ufb01t the rest\nof the space, making sure there\u2019s minimal room for movement. You\u2019ll get\nbetter with time - sometimes I \ufb01nd\nmyself stu\ufb03ng a few boiled broccoli\n\ufb02orets to \ufb01ll in the gaps.\nNow the important bit for non-ther-mal containers - make sure *every-thing* has su\ufb03ciently cooled down to\nroom temp or just about. Condensation in lunchboxes is your enemy; the\nmoisture that resultsdue to that is just\nan open invitation for bugs to breed\non the inside. Don\u2019t seal your container completely until you can be sure\nyou\u2019ve su\ufb03ciently minimized this!\nhere\u2019s nothing stopping you from using leftover dishes to save time. I \ufb01nd\nthat if I\u2019ve made a bit too much stir fry\nor stew for dinner one night, it ends\nup with a fresh spot of rice as my lunch\nfor the next day. Have some common\nsense, though; the \u201cyounger\u201d the lefto-vers, the better. I\u2019m not responsible\nfor what happens if you pack that stew\nwhich seems to have developed a new\necosystem on its surface.\nYou don\u2019t *have* to make your\nlunch look uber-pretty \u2013 at the end\nof the day, your lunch\u2019s going down\nthe hatch so there\u2019s no need to fuss\naround with various animal-shapped\ncutters or the like. However, if it\u2019s\nnot going to take more than a minute and you\u2019re a closet crafter like\nmoi, then by all means, arrange your\nfood in whatever quirky way you\nwant (like the smiley/frowney faces\nyou see here. Just try not to handle\nthe food too much with your \ufb01ngers\n\u2013 use clean utensils (cocktail sticks\nare your friend for decorations like\nthese.)\nAnd that\u2019s it \u2013 a really rudimentary\ninsight on how to pack Asian style\nlunches/bentos. Hopefully those\nwith \u201cculinary yellow fever\u201d will now\nhave an excuse to prepare Asian\nhome cooking to take with you into\nuni.

Of course you\ncan do this in the microwave; though\nthat won\u2019t kill the stu\ufb00 on the surface\nunlike direct heating using a pan.\nSample bento preparation timeline\nIt helps to practise - the first few times you make bento lunches, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re a bit slow.You\u2019ll soon pick up ways to shave minutes off the prep\nprocess. Here\u2019s an example of what my morning would be like if I was prepping\nthe bento shown and chopping meat/veg from scratch:\n8.20: Take out pans, ingredients and utensils needed (utensils can be laid out\nthe night before if desired - saves rummaging!)\n8.22: Take precooked rice out from freezer, defrost in microwave (if I cooked it\nwith a timed rice cooker, even better! Just pack and let cool.)\n8.23: Cut up vegetables and chicken. Mix chicken with marinade.\n8.27: Pack rice into bento box, let cool.\n8.29: Stir fry meat and eggs at the same time in separate pans.\n8.32: Take eggs out and put into bento box to cool with silicone cup divid-er. Wipe pan down with kitchen paper and stir fry vegetables (or bung in\nmicrowave!)\n8.35: Take meat out, pack into box to cool.\n8.36: Pack veggies into bento box with divider, leave to cool. Hunt for treats.\n8.40: Close box properly, pop everything in backpack and head out for 9am\nclass!\nNO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH?\nPsst - we at Food have been in touch with a couple of London establishments recently, and\nwe\u2019re expecting to do some reviews in the near future. We\u2019re still on the hunt for more,\nthough!\nIf you\u2019d like to suggest a great little place for us to try out \u2013 heck, if you want to be the one\ndoing the trying and giving feedback after \u2013 then get in touch!

Our involvement in two\nof the first round of ERC Synergy\nprojects is a testament to the mul-ti-disciplinary research ethos that\npervades the College and, in both\ncases, also emphasises the College\u2019s\nfocus on the translation of research\ninto practical solutions that address\nsome of society\u2019s most pressing issues.\u201d\nA foreign exchange scheme that, in\nprevious years, had often allowed\na student from each department in\nthe Faculty of Engineering to study\nfor a year at the University of California has this year drastically reduced its places. As a result of a\ndecrease in the number of students\nat the University of California who\nwish to participate in the project\nonly two places were available this\nyear for Imperial students.\nThe programme is open to students in their final year \u2013 who apply\nin autumn of the preceding year. The\nUniversity of California curriculum\ninvolves to those studied at Imperial\nand students must also complete an\n\u201cindependent research project\u201d.\nA third year mechanical engineering student, told Felix that he\n\u201capplied for the program and went\nthrough a motivational letter stage\nand then an interview stage in front\nof three lecturers from the mechanical engineering department and was\nselected mid-November\u201d. He was\ntold that he \u201cmight have another interview at faculty level\u201d but that on\nthe last day of term was told that he\n\u201cwon\u2019t be going\u201d. He added that he\nwas \u201cdeeply upset about this\u201d and\nthat, so far, he has \u201cbeen unsuccessful in trying to gather reasons\nfor why the faculty has chosen the\nother departments\u2019 members and\nnot mechanical engineering (espe-cially since it is the biggest in terms\nof size) without further interviews\nor selection procedures\u201d.\nDr Pat Leevers, Mechanical Engineering Director of Courses, responded that the Department was\n\u201cto say the least, disappointed in\nthe outcome of this year\u2019s U Cal exchange scheme\u201d. He praised the candidates who \u201chad put time and effort\ninto preparing strong applications\u201d\nand expressed \u201cbitter disappointment\u201d at how the student who was\nselected by the department was \u201cunsuccessful at the Faculty level, where\nthe odds of success seem to diminish each year\u201d. He added that the\nDepartment would \u201ccertainly now\nbe looking at alternative options to\nthe present Faculty-wide scheme\u201d.\nDoug Hunt, Imperial College Union Deputy President (Education),\ncommented on the exchange programme saying: \u201cIt is quite hard\nto get more than 2 [places] as we\nneed students from UC wishing to\ncome here to be able to send more\nthere. Currently that isn\u2019t happening\nthough. Only way of creating more\nplaces at US universities is having\nmore US partners but this is more\nadmin for the College and departments.\u201d\nAmerican students have offered\ninsight into the possible reason for\nthe decrease in incoming applicants.\nIt may be due to Imperial offering\nonly year long exchanges. Other universities offer single terms. As the\nsystem in the USA works on credits,\nit could mean that students from the\nUSA are less prepared to leave for an\nentire year as it would require harder work when they returned. This\nwould be because year away could\nharm their credit choices more than\njust a term abroad. At the time of\ngoing to print Adrian Hawksworth,\nCollege Assistant Registrar (Place-ments), who until recently had been\nin charge of the programme, was\nunavailable for comment.\nThe European Research Council\n(ERC) has awarded over \u20ac25m to\nImperial College in the latest funding round. These grants are for 11\nprojects, and these include two prestigious synergy grants that promote\npartnerships in academic research.\nThe Synergy grant scheme was\npiloted this year, it allocates up to\n\u20ac15m over six years for projects that\naim to enhance collaborations between researchers that can produce\nresults that would not be possible\nto produce working alone. Consequently, the collaborations enhance\nthe complementary skills, knowledge and resources available to re-searchers.\nThe ERC received over 700 applications for Synergy grants, but\nonly 11 projects were funded across\nthe EU. The first Synergy project\nat Imperial is the \u201cIntelligent implantable modulator of Vagus nerve\nfunction for treatment of obesity\u201d\n(i2MOVE). This received a grant of\nover \u20ac7m and was awarded to Professor Christopher Toumazou and\nProfessor Sir Stephen Bloom, from\nthe Departments of Electrical Engineering and Medicine respectively.\nThis team will create a device that\nmimics the response of the vagus\nnerve after eating, suppressing the\nappetite of a patient; achieved by\ncombining their expertise in bioengineering and endocrinology. The\nsecond project grant was awarded\nto Professor Daniel Rueckert, from\nthe Department of Computing, in\npartnership with colleagues at Kings\nCollege and Oxford. The project\nis entitled \u201cThe Developing Human Connectome Project\u201d (dHCP),\nwhich aims to provide an insight\ninto neuropsychiatry conditions\nsuch as autism; achieved by using\nMRI to track brain connectivity in\nfoetuses and newborn children. The\nproject has received a grant of over\n\u20ac14m, of which \u20ac3.250m will go to\nProfessor Rueckert.\nAlthough the synergy grants are\nthe most high profile, the College\nhas also received another \u20ac15m in\ngrants by the ERC in Starting and\nAdvanced Grants.

A list of\ntwenty universities targeted found\nWarwick University at the top and\nImperial at 12th place.\nThe majority of graduate employers including BP, Civil Service, IBM,\nGoldman Sachs, PwC, Google and\nHSBC concentrate on this small\nhandful of universities with some\nhighly rated institutions such as St\nAndrews not appearing in the list.\nCambridge came a respectable 4th\nbehind Nottingham and Manchester and Oxford is considered the\n7th most targeted university. Imperial comes behind Bristol, Durham,\nBirmingham, Bath, Leeds and Sheffield University, but thankfully not\nUCL \u2013 so we can all celebrate a bit.\nThe report showed a fall in the\nnumber of graduate jobs available\nwith a drop of 0.8 per cent in en-try-level graduate jobs over the last\nyear. It was revealed that one-in-five firms are scaling back funding\nfor their graduate recruitment programmes compared with last year.\nFirms are more likely to use social\nmedia to promote their graduate\nschemes with 71% of firms planning\nto increase the use of this approach\nand one-in-four saying they would\nbe putting fewer resources into university career fairs.\nThe Graduate Market in 2013 report indicates that students are being approached earlier, with 42 of\nthe top 100 firms saying they were\nmore likely to promote graduate\nroles to first years than in previous\nyears. 28 of the top firms claimed to\nbe targeting penultimate year students more than they have done in\nthe past.

    "content": "Steam sales pseudo-soliloquy\nPietro Aronica on\u201cMyRestraint\u201dwithforewordbyJeremyPac-man\nf you are a student at Imperial\nCollege, then there is a reasonable chance that you play video\ngames, possibly on a PC. If you\ndo, then you\u2019ll most likely be\nfamiliar with Steam, but if not, let me\nsum it up for you: it\u2019s like a vacuum\ncleaner for money. Speci\ufb01cally, my\nmoney, and the money of thousands\nof others who would never think to\nplay certain titles if they weren\u2019t sold\nat extremely slashed prices. Steam is a\nprogram for the digital distribution of\ngames that will often pop up with o\ufb00ers\nand sales and whatnot for titles that\nlook interesting and cost half, a quarter,\na tenth of their original price. Might as\nwell, right? Twenty might-as-wells lat-er, you have a full library of games, full\nafternoons and evenings from here till\nthe next Steam sale, and a much emptier wallet.\nI used to mock women. \u201cSilly women!\u201d I would say (incidentally, I\u2019m not\nvery good with girls). \u201cSilly women,\u201d I\nwould repeat, \u201cWhat pleasure do they\nderive from shopping, from hunting\nbargains on shoes and blouses and\ndresses that they buy more for the price\nthan for their actual utility? hey are\nworn once, and then left in some ward-robe, and they complain they never\nhave enough. Such a waste of money!\u201d\nWell, I now understand. For them,\nit may be clothes, but for me, it\u2019s the\ncheap, intriguing, only-a-click-away\ngames that Steam o\ufb00ers me.\nSo last year, I drew the line. I looked\nat the list of games in my library, and\nsaw that most were un\ufb01nished, some\nnot even installed, and vowed to not\nbe tempted by sales or o\ufb00ers until I\nreached the conclusion, or equally\nsatisfying degree of mastery with the\ngames, of all of them. hat would be\nmy resolution for the new year.\nI started with Bastion, the game that\nprompted my change of policy on falling for Steam\u2019s tricks, and \ufb01nished it\nin a couple of weeks. It\u2019s an isometric\nbrawler where you control some dude\ngoing around smashing stu\ufb00 and \ufb01nding more about this forsaken world you\nlive in. hough I make it sound simplis-tic, it is in fact very deep and engaging,\nand some of the most satisfying combat manoeuvres I\u2019ve ever pulled were\nwith this game.\nI then had to tackle Oblivion, the Eater of Time. In my folly, I had purchased\nthe super ultra deluxe collector\u2019s limited edition, with a bunch more missions\nand an entire extra region. hough I\nusually try to \ufb01nish all games in their\nentirety, I had to drastically reconsider\nmy de\ufb01nition of completion, or I would\nget mired in endless fetch quests. I\npowered through the main missions,\nwhich were monumentally disappoint-ing: virtually indistinguishable from the\nother quests, they had more scripted\nscenes and a bombastic tone that failed\nto deliver. I didn\u2019t really believe we were\nall going to die at the hand of a demon\nany moment now, when I\u2019d spent the\nlast in-game month running errands\nfor various people. It was a problem of\nMorrowind before it, and I suspect of\nSkyrim as well, though I haven\u2019t played\nit. A greater sense of urgency would\nhelp with the narrative.\nI then \ufb01nished Mass E\ufb00ect, which\nhad been in my library for years and\nwhich I went through in a couple of\nhours when I managed to tear myself\nfrom the preconception that I should\ngo for 100% completion. It is a hard\nhabit to kick, though: both Assassin\u2019s\nCreed II and Far Cry II are still in need\nof some more playing, despite the fact\nthat it would take maybe a day at most.\nIt\u2019s those damn collectibles: pointless,\nidiotic baubles that are infuriatingly\nhard to \ufb01nd and add nothing. If I don\u2019t\nretrieve them all, my OCD tendencies\nwill twitch; if I do by looking at an online walkthrough, I\u2019ll grumble at myself\nfor giving up; if I actually manage to\n\ufb01nd them all, I\u2019ll cry at how I was manipulated and how much time I wasted.\nAge of Wonders came next, a criminally underrated series of turn-based,\nfantasy strategy games. he second title and its standalone expansion, Shadow Magic, are complex, interesting and\nat times very funny; less \ufb01nicky than\nthe Civilization series, with more visceral combat and a greater emphasis on\n\ufb01ghting than empire-building, I think\nthey are among the best of the genre.\nI then moved onto a Aquaria, a 2D\nMetroidvania sort of game, where you\nwander in an immense map defeating\nenemies, solving puzzles and acquiring\nnew powers that let you go to di\ufb00erent\nparts of the map. It\u2019s interesting and\nchallenging, but its save system is punitive and the ending is an infuriating\n(Spoiler Alert) \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d that\nwas never continued, so make of that\nwhat you will.\nTorchlight followed, aka Diablo with\nWoW graphics, a cute enough game to\nkeep me busy for a bunch of hours. After it, I \ufb01nished S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow\nof Chernobyl, a gritty, depressing, tough\nshooter that will bring you from looting\ncorpses in grey and abandoned power\nplants to \ufb02eeing monstrous mutants in\ngrey and abandoned warehouses. I still\nliked it: it\u2019s immersive and atmospheric\nand a nice change from games in which\nyou are a superpowered machine of\ndestruction, with in\ufb01nite bullets and\nregenerating health.

Uneven or lacklustre construction commonly leads to broken girders,\nsnapped cables and drowned pedes-trians. he only thing missing is a sad\ntrombone. I really enjoy this type of\ngame, so I thought it was good to have a\nnew bunch of challenges to go through,\nyet I wonder why no advancements have\nbeen made since the olden days, apart\nfrom graphically. Why not spice up the\ngameplay by allowing you to build in\nmore than two dimensions, to allow\nmassive bridge networks with helter-skelter sections? Production team, I\nhope you\u2019re reading. Verdict-wise, you\u2019ll\nget lots of hours of fun out of it, if you\u2019re\ninto spending nights creating a bridge\nthat only spans 100 metres, contains\nenough steel to make a few Titanics and\nstill collapses when a single car drives\nover it.\nIf your interest has been piqued, pick\nup the demos for the predecessors and\ngive them a go.

Not up for nominations at the Oscars\n\u201cG\u00e9G\u00e9\u201d is the a\ufb00ectionate nickname\nof famous French actor G\u00e9rard\nDepardieu; but lately he hasn\u2019t been\nthe recipient of much a\ufb00ection.\nInstead, Depardieu has found himself\nat the centre of a debate that has\ntaken place in countless nations since\nthe \ufb01nancial crisis began; how great\nshould the tax burden be, and how\nshould it be shared? In practice, the\nquestion is narrowed down further,\nso that the narrative focuses on the\nhighest earners in society and the\ndisparity of the \u201c1%\u201d versus the 99.\nIn France, current centre-left\nPresident Francois Hollande brought\nthe debate into the political sphere\nduring his election campaign; his\nParti Socialiste ran on a platform of\nequally split budget cuts, tax cuts and\ntax rises that included a so called 75%\n\u201cSuper Tax\u201d on individuals earning\nover \u20ac1m. hough largely taken as\na symbolic gesture for its expected\nrevenue of \u20ac200m, the tax made\nHollande\u2019s political stance resolutely\nclear, but immediately attracted\ncontroversy.\nhe 75% rate constitutes the highest\nincome tax of any nation in the world,\nfollowed up by Sweden\u2019s 57% upper\nlimit. Despite an overwhelming\npublic support of 60%, however, many\nbusiness groups accuse Hollande\nof driving away entrepreneurs and\nthreatening the French recovery; if\nthese arguments sound familiar, it\u2019s\nbecause they\u2019re almost identical to the\ndebate over the 50% tax instigated at\nthe end of the last Labour government,\nand now cut to 45% by the Coalition.\nShortly after Hollande\u2019s\nannouncement, many prominent\nwealthy citizens such as Jean Michel\nJarre, Brigitte Bardot, and CEO of the\nluxury LVMH group Bernard Arnault\nadmitted to considering or even\ntaking steps towards expatriating.\nAnd, of course, Depardieu.\nWhy, then, does G\u00e9rard\u2019s case make\nthe headlines, even here in the United\nKingdom? Because it has far greater\nsymbolism than any of the others;\nD\u00e9pardieu was born the son of a poor\nmetal worker, and left school at age 15;\ngiven his own upbringing, shouldn\u2019t\nthe issue of taxation and provision of\npublic services be close to his heart?\nhus, when it emerged D\u00e9pardieu\nhad purchased a mansion in the\nBelgian village of N\u00e9chin, it provoked\noutrage; N\u00e9chin is notorious for\nits community of wealthy French\n\u201cfrontali\u00e8res\u201d, who pro\ufb01t from the\nregion\u2019s lower taxation.\nFrance\u2019s Prime Minister, JeanJacques Ayrault, weighed in, declaring\nD\u00e9pardieu\u2019s actions \u201cpathetic\u201d, and\nculture minister Audrey Filippetti\naccused the actor of \u201cdeserting the\nbattle\ufb01eld\u201d in the country\u2019s war\nagainst economic crisis. he story\nthen took an amazingly bizarre turn,\nwith D\u00e9pardieu writing an open\nletter to the Prime Minister declaring\nthat he was \u201creturning his passport\u201d,\nand accepting an o\ufb00er of Russian\ncitizenship from Vladimir Putin\nhimself.\nhough for the moment it seems\nthe story is on pause; the 75% tax\nis presently unworkable as it was\nrejected by the French constitutional\ncourts on a technicality. However, the\nanalysis of D\u00e9pardieu\u2019s letter rumbles\non. In it, he rejects accusations of\nshirking responsibility, claiming\nto have paid \u20ac145M in tax over his\nlifetime, and that he paid a total of 85%\ntax on his income last year. It seems\nthat, in arriving at this 85% \ufb01gure,\nD\u00e9pardieu is taking into account all\nthe charges levied on incomes from\nhis various business interests and\nthe 75% rate; that this hasn\u2019t yet been\nimposed, and indeed ignores other\nvast contributions to his fortune such\nas the recent sale of his Parisian hotel.\nAs Hollande has sworn to rework\nand pursue his 75% tax rate, the\ndebate over tax in France looks set\nto continue, and indeed similar \ufb01ghts\nare playing out the world over. From\nAmerica\u2019s \ufb01scal cli\ufb00 negotiations to\nBritain\u2019s recent debate over welfare\nreform, the crisis is forcing many\nnations to reassess the conditions\nthat prevailed in the years of boom\nand lax regulation, and the political\nestablishment will have to grind away\nat this issue for years to come.\nFrance steps up intervention in Mali\nAlexander Soloviev Writer\nMali is in the middle of a crisis.\nSince the start of 2012, a war of\nindependence has been fought\nin its northern provinces, known\ncollectively as Azawad. he con\ufb02ict\nended abruptly in April with the\nousting of the then President Amadou\nToumani Tour\u00e9, by rebelling soldiers\nover his handling of the war. he\nloose alliance of Tuaregs and Islamists\n(Ansar Dine, a group linked to AlQaeda) then declared Azawad an\nindependent state.\nhe short war led to a dire\nhumanitarian crisis: some 200,000\npeople are currently displaced, with\nmillions more expected to be a\ufb00ected\nby drought. Amnesty International,\na human rights group, reported\ninstances of gang rape, executions\nwithout trial and the use of child\nsoldiers in Azawad.\nBesides the human su\ufb00ering,\ncultural casualties are also amassing:\nIslamists seem to be keen on wiping\nout the UNESCO-recognized\nIslamic shrines, considered sacred\nby Su\ufb01 muslims. Ansar Dine views\nthese shrines as idolatrous and,\nthus, inconsistent with their aim\nof spreading and ruling Azawad by\nSharia law.\nWith such a large humanitarian\ncrisis at hand and the potential for\nthe birth of a Sharia-ruled Al-Qaeda\nlinked state in Saharan Africa, the\ncosts of containing the crisis could\nnever be higher. he government\nin Mali formally requested for\ninternational support, following an\nIslamist push into southern Mali.\nIt is reassuring to see that the call\nfor help answered so expediently,\nwith both the African Union and the\nEuropean Union o\ufb00ering military\nsupport to Mali. he French are at\nthe forefront of intervention, already\ndeploying 800 soldiers with hundreds\nmore arriving in the coming days. Air\nstrikes are a daily occurrence. he\nBritish and Belgians are providing the\nFrench intervention with equipment\nor technical support.\nIn addition to the French boots on\nthe ground, thousands of African\nUnion troops are being deployed\nas well. Neighbouring nations are\nparticularly interested in preventing\na terrorist haven from entrenching in\ntheir backyards.\nCuriously absent from the scene\nis the United States. As the State\nDepartment stated, no direct\nmilitary aid to Mali can be allocated\nuntil leaders are appointed through\nelections. hough troop deployment\ndoes not seem like a possibility, the\nPentagon has been collaborating\nwith the French military, providing\nintelligence from satellite images, as\nwell as intercepted signals.\nhe foreign involvement in Mali\nrepresents an intriguing change in\nglobal politics. America no longer\nviews itself as the global police force\nto every con\ufb02ict, wisely choosing the\ncheaper and politically safer option of\nsupporting regional powers to solve\ntheir issues. he debt crisis, as well\nas the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan,\nweighs in heavily.\nhe French, on the other hand, are\nexperiencing a renewed involvement\nin world a\ufb00airs as a vocal leader.\nQadda\ufb01 was toppled with the help\nof French-led air support, a victory\nfor France and Sarkozy, even if it\ndidn\u2019t keep him in office. French\ninvolvement does pose some acute\nproblems, with Islamists threatening\nattacks upon France itself. President\nHollande seems willing to risk the\npossibility of a terrorist attack and\neven entertains the possibility of\nprolonged involvement in Mali, so\nlong as it means the end of a lawless\nand unstable region so close to home.\nFor the most part, Malians have\nwelcomed the foreign troops happily.\nStabilizing the situation in Azawad\nwould allow closing refugee camps\nthat taxed the south of the country,\nas well as its neighbours. For the\nthousands of displaced, it means they\ncan return home.\nWrite\nfor\nPolitics!\nEmail\nus at:\npolitics.felix\n@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m so\nRussian I even have\na traditional dress!\u201d\nG\u00e9rard Depardieu\nReuters\nThe French\n[...] are\nexperiencing\na renewed\ninvolvement in\nworld affairs\n\n"

This\nyear it was annoying that they made\nthe winning photos the first on display in each section\u2019s line-up, which\nruins the suspense and excitement\nwhen you know the subsequent\nimages will be (in the judges\u2019 eyes)\nworse.\nIt is always fun to go with a friend\nand have a debate about whether the\nright winners were chosen and why.\nEvery visitor has an opinion for every photo and it is very interesting to\neavesdrop and hear what other people think in comparison to yourself.\nParticular highlights include\n\u201cGhost Bears\u201d, an image of two male\nbrown bears fighting in the eastern Finland. Take one look at the\npicture, and you hear their violent\ngrowls and roars which seem to be\nmuffled by the visual blurring of the\npicture. It feels as if the lack of clarity of the image makes it less frightening to look at, but at the same time\nreminds you of the strength of these\ncreatures in motion.\nAlso enjoyed was \u201cFly-by Drinking\u201d, a snap of the endangered grey-headed flying fox bat with a cheeky\ntongue bobbing out as it skims over\na body of water for a drink, as well as\n\u201cSands of Time\u201d, which displays the\nintricate beauty and colour of marine invertebrate skeletons worthy of\nany wrapping paper (which the gift\nshop disappointingly did not have).\nThese were just a few personal favourites amongst numerous other\nunbelievably striking images. However, fans who regularly attend may\nalso be slightly disappointed by many\nrepetitive themes which seen to crop\nup each year, and even throughout\nthe exhibition. It does not make\nthem uninteresting or unoriginal\npictures, but it does get a bit boring\nafter seeing, for the upteenth time,\na stranded or struggling polar bear\naccompanied by a caption about the\nmelting ice and our environmental\nresponsibilities; the opposite reaction to what the photographs were\nprobably trying to evoke.\nThis is not an exhibition solely\nfor photography, wildlife or biology\nfans. You do not have to be any of\nthose things to appreciate the stunning aesthetics of nature, and what\nthey represent in our world today.\nPlus, entry is a bargain: half price for\nstudents (at \u00a35), and the gift shop is\nalways an exciting end to the visit.\nLily Le Writer\nBad belles\nbring the bard\nbehind bars\nbrilliantly\nAttheDonmarWarehouse,Ihavealways\nfound my way into the parallel reality\nthat theatre should create. With Phillipa\nLloyd\u2019s new production of Julius Caesar,\none can simultaneously \ufb01nd oneself in\nnot one, but two di\ufb00erent realities.\nhere was no real need to set an all-female production of Julius Caesar in a\nwomen\u2019s jail. he staging seems to be an\nexcuse for the all-female cast when a justi\ufb01cation is entirely unnescessary. hese\nwomen play men as well as any man can\nplay a woman.\nhat said, the jail scenario is a fresh approach and works well, especially under\nLloyd\u2019s precise direction. he prisoners\nroam the halls in stark, simple costumes,\nplay-acting at Julius Caesar and guards\ninterrupt when the rowdiness becomes\nintolerable. hese interruptions were\nvery frustrating to the audience, who\ncould, however, also feel the frustration\nof the women whose only pastime had\nbeen rudely broken o\ufb00. It creates a dual\nlevel of complicity with the characters;\nour sympathies are not only with Shakespeare\u2019s characters, but also with the\nprisoners who are trying to take part in\na form of escapism, in the same way that\nwe, the audience, are.\nhe acting was faultless and every\nword was spoken with clarity and with\nindividual meaning. he characters in\nJulius Caesar all search for freedom from\ntyrannical rule; even Caesar is under the\ntyranny of fear. his struggle was evoked\nwith lucidity by the very strong cast.\nFrances Barber is a sensual, attractive\nCaesar. he vulgarity she assumes when\nin the role has an element of repulsive-ness, which plays o\ufb00 very well against\nthe nobility displayed by Harriet Walter\u2019s Brutus. Walter\u2019s Brutus is a man of\nrestrained emotion, but one who suffers deeply for his actions. Clare Dunne\nplaysBrutus\u2019wife,Portia,withatouching\ncombination of frailty and strength. She\nalso appears as the brutal, murderous\navenger Octavius Caesar, and is equally\nat ease in both roles. Finally, Jenny Jules\nis a powerful Cassius, compelling as the\ninstigator of Caesar\u2019s murder.\nYou and me baby ain\u2019t\nnothing but mammals...\n...let\u2019s do it like they do at\nthe Wildlife Photographer\nof the year exhibition\n...also bi-curi-ous beauties\nEva Rosenthal Arts editor\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\n18\nDaniel Sokol\nFailed your exams, huh?\nast year, a friend of mine\nfailed his PhD. He turned\nto me for advice.\nI reviewed the case, and\ndiscovered that he had not\nbeen o\ufb00ered a second viva, contrary\nto the university\u2019s regulations. Without a second viva, he had no opportunity to defend his thesis orally. he\nexaminers had little experience of\nexamining PhDs and there was evidence of bias in the assessment of the\nthesis. When the examiners told my\nfriend the bad news, they barely gave\nany reasons.\nA few weeks after receiving my\nfriend\u2019s appeal letter, the university\u2019s\nappeal board held that the regulations had been breached. My friend\nwas allowed to resubmit his thesis\nwith new examiners. his experience\ninspired me to set up Alpha Academic Appeals, which advises and assists\nstudents in their appeals.\nWhen I was a lecturer, I marked\nhundreds of exam scripts. Few academics will deny that marking is, on\nthe whole, a soul-sapping task. On\none occasion, a student contacted me\nto say there was an error in his script.\nMy office partner at the time, a more\nsenior academic, advised me to say\nthat the result is \ufb01nal and to refuse\nto revisit the script. I thought it fair\nto double check. To my surprise, the\nmarks were added incorrectly. Examiners, however experienced, will occasionally make mistakes, and those\nwill not always be picked up by a second examiner.\nSo what if you fail an exam and want\nto appeal? here are two grounds for\nappealing against a decision of the\nBoard of Examiners, and you will\nnote that disagreeing with the academic judgment of the examiners is\nnot one of them. hey are:\n1. hat the exam(s) was not conducted in accordance with the relevant instructions, regulations or\nrequirements.\nL\nDaniel Sokol gives his advice on writing appeals for those with\nlegitimate grounds\n2. Where new evidence is provided\nof circumstances which might have\nadversely a\ufb00ected your performance\nin the exams.\nWhatever your reasons, they must\n\ufb01t within at least one of the above.\nYou must therefore \ufb01nd out what the\nrelevant \u201cinstructions, regulations or\nrequirements\u201d are. hey can be found\non the Imperial website (http://\nwww3.imperial.ac.uk/registry/pro-ceduresandregulations).\nIllness and bereavement are often\ninvoked as reasons for appealing an\nexam result. he \u2018Guidance to Students\u2019 is clear on this issue:\n\u201cYou are reminded that if you believe your performance in exams may\nbe a\ufb00ected by illness (or by other\npersonal circumstances) you should\nreport the matter to your tutor before sitting the exams, or as soon as\npossible thereafter. You should not\nwait for your results before deciding\nto notify the College of the situation.\n\u201cInformation regarding extenuating circumstances received after the\nexams will not be considered as the\ngrounds for an appeal, unless there\nare exceptional reasons why this information could not be provided at\nthe time.\u201d\nIf you have been withdrawn from\nyour course, there are di\ufb00erent\ngrounds of appeal, which can be\nfound in Appendix 1 of the Regulations. Whatever the appeal, the key\npoint is to refer to the appropriate\ngrounds of appeal and to the rules\nand regulations which were allegedly\nbreached.\nFinally, Imperial College is a uni-versity, and universities, like NHS\ntrusts and local authorities, are public bodies. his means that, in making\ndecisions, Imperial must adhere to\nrecognised principles of public law. It\nmust, for example, follow a fair procedure and avoid bias. In short, its\ndecisions must be fair.\nAll this can be daunting, especially after receiving the bad news\nof a failed exam or withdrawal from\nthe course. You may wish to contact a College Tutor or the Imperial\nCollege Student Adviser for help. It\ncosts nothing, but remember to act\npromptly. You generally only have\nfour weeks from the date of receiving\nofficial noti\ufb01cation of your results to\nsubmit your appeal, along with supporting evidence.\nYou want to give yourself plenty\nof time to read the rules and regula-tions, write a persuasive appeal letter,\nand gather any evidence to support\nyour claims. Ask others to read your\nappeal letter and make suggestions\non how to improve it.\nOne \ufb01nal point. Statistically, the\nchances of a successful appeal are\nlow. Most appeals are weak and rightly dismissed. here is no entitlement\nto passing exams, however high the\ntuition fees. Yet, some appeals have\nstrong grounds and good prospects\nof success. In such cases, students\nshould be encouraged to appeal.\n\u201c\u201d\nWrite a per-suassive appeal letter,\nand gather\nevidence to\nsupport your\nclaims.\nStandard viva\nboard at Imperial\nLetters\nIn Felix 11/01, an article attempted to\ncompare workloads at Imperial and\nOxbridge. Was the writer aware that\nOxford only has 20 teaching weeks per\nyear? Was he aware of the importance\nof the Supervision/tutorial system at\nOxbridge?\nVery poor research leading to misleading conclusions!!\nProfessor Roderick A Smith, FREng,\nScD\nChief Scientific Advisor Department\nfor Transport\nImmediate Past President Institution\nof Mechanical Engineers\nChairman Future Rail Research Centre\nImperial College London\nvia email\nFollow us @FelixComment\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLike us facebook.com/FelixComment\nWrite for Comment\n\n"

Every year the Union publishes a\nresponse to the NSS with the aim of\nimproving the student experience across\nthe whole College.\nLast year, 71% of \ufb01nal years \ufb01lled in\nthe NSS and we are hoping to beat\nthis percentage to give a more fully\nrepresentative view of how satis\ufb01ed\nImperial\u2019s students are. To help make\nthe survey as useful as possible we\nhave a few tips to those who have yet to\ncomplete it:\n1. Rate your entire degree, not your final\nyear.\nThe NSS is very different to SOLE.\nUse SOLE to discuss the positives and\nDoug Hunt\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (EDUCATION)\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nimperialcollegeunion.org/sabbs\nKeep up-to-date with your Sabbaticals at:\nnegatives of your year and NSS for the\npositives and negatives of your whole\ndegree.\n2. Don\u2019t be neutral.\nOn many questions you will these\noptions: strongly agree, slightly agree,\nneutral, slightly disagree, strongly\ndisagree. Neutral responses give us no\nindication as to whether things need\nimproving or are going very well. Make\nyour voice count.\n3. Give detailed comments on open text\nboxes.\nThere are free-text boxes on the survey.\nBe as detailed as possible if you want to\nmake an impact.\nSo if you are a \ufb01nal year, \ufb01ll in the survey\nnow at www.thestudentsurvey.com.\nYou can also win a \u00a320 Union Shop\nvoucher or a Summer Ball ticket for\ncompleting the survey!\nAlso, you don\u2019t need to wait until a survey\nto make changes in your Department.\nYour Representatives meet key teaching\nForfiveminutesofyourtime\nyoucouldwinan\nipadmini\n&moregreatprizes!\nand administrative staff regularly to \ufb01x\nissues and pass on praise; \ufb01nd your rep\non the Union website now.\n\n"

Boarding the four coaches,\nwe headed on the short trip to the\nFrench Alps; across the channel by\nferry and through France. Stopping at\nthe supermarket at the bottom of the\nmountain to make provisions for the\nweek we were shocked at the ridiculously low drinks prices. Stocking up\non \ufb01ve litre petrol canisters of wine, we\nwere set for the week!\nArriving in Val T we were greeted\nwith metres of fresh powder. Snow\nconditions were amazing throughout\nthe week with so much o\ufb00-piste on\no\ufb00er. Several of the days had perfect\nblue skies allowing everyone to make\nthe most of the less accessible powder.\nFreestyle Captain and self-confessed\ngangster, Mikkel, demonstrated the\nproper way to do a cli\ufb00 drop, landing straight on his ass from 20 foot\nup. For those more akin to staying on\npiste, we had a dual slalom race day between ourselves and the other London\nuniversities on our trip \u2013 ULU, UAL,\nGreenwich, Ravensbourne and Westminster \u2013 needless to say, a team from\nImperial took \ufb01rst prize.\nOn top of the great snow there was\nthe crazy apr\u00e8s-ski. Bar 360 was the\nplace to be after a day\u2019s skiing or snowboarding with students partying there\nfrom all of the London SnowOperative\nuniversities (the group of snowsports\nclubs who went on this trip). his was\nalso the venue for the Mountain Meal\nof meat fondue and plenty of wine. Skiing down from the Mountain Meal allowed people to do funny challenges,\nsuch as Michael Parkes riding down\non one ski. he apr\u00e8s didn\u2019t stop there\nwith a di\ufb00erent nightclub each night.\nhe highlight has to be the Wednesday\nnight when Danny Byrd of Hospital\nRecords played to a crowd of almost\n2000 students.\nAfter such a week, it was sad to say\ngoodbye \u2013 to new found love, to new\nfriends and old, and most of all to the\nunique beauty that is a university ski\ntrip. After a rough head count, we were\non our way, exhausted, but in equally\nhigh spirits knowing that we had just\nbared witness to an incredible trip.\nA big thank you is needed to Vlad,\nour trip organiser who worked tirelessly on putting this trip together as\nwell as the rest of the Snowsports com-mittee. Also thanks to travel company\nNUCO for helping us through it. Lastly, if you came on the trip, thank you\nfor making it the best one yet!\nIf you missed out or have been left\ngagging for more, do not fear as we\nhave our Easter Trip to Alpe D\u2019Huez\nfrom 22nd-30th March. his is BUSC\nMain Event with 2500+ UK university\nstudents in one resort \u2013 with competitions all week if you want another\nsensational holiday. To book on, visit\nwww.buscevents.com and select Imperial as your university. As well as this,\nnext year\u2019s winter trip should be just as\nbig and so don\u2019t leave it to the last minute to book! Any questions \u2013 email us\nat ski@ic.ac.uk. As always, Snow Love!\nJohn McGuckin Sports Writer\nFelix Sport catches up with Imperial\u2019s most successful ski trip yet\nMove over Fellwanderers...\nNice curves.\nI believe this is what the\ncall the \u201clash\u201d part of\nthe trip\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nImperial chemist dies at home\n3\nFRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nI knew Joachim for the last 23 years\nhaving done our PhD\u2019s together at\nthe University of Strathclyde under\nProfessor David\u2019s Sherrington\u2019s \ufb01ne\nleadership.\nJoachim was the \u201ccrazy\u201d German\nguy. It was an incredibly intense but\nmarvellously fun time of our lives.\nhe overwhelming thing that struck\nyou about Joachim was that he was\nalways utterly, madly enthusiastic and\npassionate about chemistry, but he\nreally, really loved his own discipline\n\u2013 polymers. He would gabble on for\nhours and hours about twiddling this\nand altering that part of the polymer\nand would then turn and ask me what\ne\ufb00ect it would have on the outcome\nof the polymer structure. To which\nI would often reply \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely\nno idea\u201d. I shared a \ufb02at with him for\na long time during that period and\nlearnt all about his silly foibles \u2013 his\nobsessions with Macintosh mugs, bits\nof bicycles, awful fondues and Birkenstocks \u2013 all the things that made him\nso much of a colourful character.\nAfter this, we both went our separate ways he went to US, to join Fr\u00e9chet\u2019s group at Cornell and then returning to Cambridge whilst I went\nto Japan, still keeping in touch over\nemail. Serendipitously, after our postdoc\u2019s we both started at the same\ntime at Imperial College. He hadn\u2019t\nchanged. He was full of exuberance\nand fun, full of stupendous ideas, rich\nin their ludicrousness, but at the same\ntime they had sparkles of brilliance\n\ufb02ecked through them. hat was a very\ndi\ufb03cult time of my life and I simply\ncannot say how helpful and generous\nhe was to me during that time.\nJoachim always expected the highest standards from himself and oth-ers. He was a true scholar in the real\nsense of the word; leaving no stone\nunturned in pursuit of the truth. He\nwas exceedingly well read and knowl-edgably about a vast range of subjects\nboth, within chemistry and beyond,\nand would severely chastise anyone\nwho was not as well prepared as him.\nI fear that many a research proposal\nwilted under that fearsome gaze. He\nhad a formidable intellect and was\nincredibly generous as an individual\ngiving his time endlessly to any student or anyone else who needed help.\nHe was exceedingly sel\ufb02ess in this re-gard.\nJoachim really grew to love this\ncountry that became his home and all\nthings British \u2013 the good bits and the\nbad. He had a great sense of humour,\nand he genuinely loved the \u201cBritish\u201d\nway of looking at the world. He really\nloved life, he loved his food and loved\na good wine.\nGod-parent to my son, ex-\ufb02at mate,\nintellectual giant and the best friend a\nman could ever have, he will be very\nsorely missed by one and all, but especially by me.\nHe leaves his long-term partner,\nNatasha and my thoughts are with her\nat this time.\nhis obituary was written by Dr Rob\nLaw from the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London. Dr\nLaw was Dr Steinke\u2019s oldest and best\nfriend.\nDr Steinke died suddenly last Tuesday. he death is not being treated\nas suspicious. he cause of death was\nmost likely a heart attack. His funeral\nwill be held in Germany.\nMore student cuts\nMen\u2019s cuts \u00a322 (normally \u00a335)\nWomen\u2019s cut and rough dry \u00a328\nWomen\u2019s cut and salon finish\nblow-dry \u00a338 (normally \u00a355)\nFRESH Hairdressers has been\noffering high quality, fashionable\nhaircuts for over 20 years.

Addressing the issue is\nnow a big concern for the Union, who\nhave adopted the stance, \u201cthat the incremental rise in tuition fees, with sudden\nchanges as experienced this year, is affecting (international) students on tight\nbudgets. his causes student dissatisfac-tion, again a\ufb00ecting university prestige.\u201d\nhis is in line with the opinion of\nDominic Scott, Chief Executive of the\nUK Council for International A\ufb00airs,\nwho expressed deep concern and acknowledged that students deserved increased levels of transparency.\nhe rhetoric spawned by the issue\nhas emerged against the backdrop of\na record number of international students applying for hardship funds in\nthe 2012/2013 academic year. his may\ncome as a surprise to the wider student\nbody, with the consensus belief that\noverseas undergraduates are of affluent\nbackground. It converges with the Union\u2019s concern that student budgets are\nbeing constrained more than ever. It has\nbeen speculated that only rich students\nwill be able to come to Imperail if the\nUniversity fails to take swift remedial\naction. As cited by Wasim Khouri, OSC\nchair, \u201cMany international students\nhave approached me this year questioning whether students can do anything to\nget justi\ufb01cation from College as to the\nfee rise.\u201d\nIt is feared that the prospective international clientele of Imperial College\nmay become disillusioned by the fee\nhikes if they continue to be uninhibited and unjusti\ufb01ed, with guardians and\nsponsors withdrawing \ufb01nancial backing\nfor students in the wake of the current\neconomic climate. In the interval between the academic years of 2008/2009\n\u2013 2009/2010 average fee hikes of 4.88%\nwere imposed on students, which is\nabove the current UK in\ufb02ation rate of\n2.2%.\nOther Universities are experiencing\na back lash from their wider respective\nstudent bodies. he University of Edinburgh has notably engaged in negotiations with its student association to\nde-escalate student resentment and to\nintroduce a sustainable solution. he\nUniversity of Oxford and the University\nof Cambridge are furthermore known\nto charge as much as \u00a337,300 for a number of courses (2009/2010 \ufb01gures).\nOther clear action proposed by Imperial College Union is that they intend\nto lobby the College to \u201cgive students\ninformation on how they come up with\nthe increase and where the money is\ndistributed\u201d and provide advance noti\ufb01cation of future rises in academic tuition fees. Proposed impetuses include a\nsigned petition, open to all (internation-al) students, which will be forwarded to\nthe appropriate College authorities. It\nhas even been suggested that if nothing\nis done about the matter, the there may\nbe student led protests by the international community.\nhe issue surrounding fee transparency is borne in context of the waning satisfaction of students at Imperial College\n(as indicated by the appropriate student\nsurveys) which have the potential to\na\ufb00ect prestigious rankings (8th Times\nWorld Universities; 2012-2013).\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nJustification sought\nJoachim H.

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n8 FRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nThe Manifesto Review\nIntherunuptoelectionsUnion President Paul\nBeaumontlooksatwhathehasandhasn\u2019tdonethisyear\ns the 2012/13 academic\nyear \ufb02ies by (this time\nlast year, I was already\nsaying \u201914 weeks til exams\u2019 in an attempt to\nmotivate myself\u2026) there are a number\nof developments to update everyone\non. For \ufb01nal years, the National Student Survey is back; for the whole\nstudent body we have, what I guess is\nkind of a survey, the dreaded e-word \u2013\nelections \u2013 looming. One term down,\nand already it\u2019s nearly time to get rid of\nthe sabbaticals.\nOver the next few weeks, all the\nsabbs will be writing to tell you about\nwhat\u2019s gone on, what\u2019s changed, what\u2019s\nimproved, what\u2019s not. Some things\nwill be obvious (yes, I know everyone still has to pay \u00a32 to get into the\nUnion\u2026 will come on to that in a\nminute), some things are potentially\nmeaningless without a bit of explana-tion. What\u2019s both amazing and annoying about my role (and if you\u2019re thinking of running for my position, this\nis possibly the most frustrating part\nyou\u2019ll have to deal with) is that I can\u2019t\ntell you half the stu\ufb00 I do: it\u2019s \u2018con\ufb01dential\u2019 or \u2018commercially sensitive\u2019. It\u2019s\nthat way for a good reason: it\u2019s not that\nthe College is trying to hide things\nfrom students, but it\u2019s not possible to\nput everything in the public domain\n(like business deals, etc) until they\u2019re\ndone. Infuriatingly, I\u2019m also not able\nto ask students for help in supporting\nme when I disagree with something\nthe College is doing. Whoever you\nelect to be the next President, you\u2019ll\nhave to trust that they\u2019ll \ufb01ght for the\nright things too, as I hope you\u2019d agree\nI\u2019m doing at the moment, if I could tell\nyou what those things were\u2026 catch\ntwenty-two.\nOn a more positive note, I thought\nbest to do a sort of \u2018manifesto review\u2019\nof the year so far. I\u2019ve marked myself\n(wouldn\u2019t it be nice if exams worked\nthat way too?), and feel free to disagree \u2013 as I\u2019m sure a few will. See right.\nI\u2019m not going to bang on about it,\nbecause last time people on the online\ncomments thought I \u2018had no mandate\u2019\nto do this, but one of the things I\u2019m\nmost proud of this year is working towards securing a future for the Union:\nboth through Charity Registration\nand through updated and improved\nagreements with the College.\nDoug and Becky will no doubt be\ntelling you about the leaps and bounds\nin which the College has improved\nin their articles; I\u2019ve already rambled\nenough but will give you a sneak pre-view. Lecture recording is being rolled\nout. Imperial Horizons has broadened\nA\n\u201cI promise to revise the new Responsible\nDrinking Policy to follow the law, whilst\nputting the fun back into our bars.\u201d\nA new Retailing of Alcohol policy (I always thought \u2018Responsible\u2019 sounded really condescending too...) went to the Executive Committee on 3 December\nand will be taken to the next Trustee Board for final approval in late January.\n\u201cAs it\u2019s financially viable (RCSU does it), I\nwant an \u2018open bar\u2019 Summer Ball.\u201d\nPlanning for the Ball 2013 has started and I have in my first version of a budget \u2013\njust as the RCSU, which I used to be Vice President for has \u2013 included a sizeable\nbar tab. This is yet to be approved though, so I won\u2019t say too much: watch this\nspace. We\u2019re also planning on making the funfair bigger and better, more \u2018free\nstuff\u2019, and hopefully a cheaper dinner than last year.\n\u201cI promise to spend time with students:\ncurrently hardly anyone sees the people\nthat represent us.\u201d\nWell I go to the bar on an evening, but there is genuinely no free time during the\nday to go to the JCR like I thought there would be. I get in to the offices at 8:30\nand leave (well, stagger out of the bar) late each evening. I don\u2019t know why I\nbother renting a flat\n\u201cI promise to improve our online systems,\nsaving time for club officers. \u201c\nWe\u2019ve launched a whole new website (written by the Union\u2019s Sysadmin, my-self, and a couple of members of staff\u2026 costing the Union very little!) and a\nnew version of eActivities (also written in-house). Imperial College Union truly\ndoes have the most advanced online systems of any Union in the country; most\nare still using paper forms. I know eActivities can be frustrating sometimes\n(we\u2019re working on speeding it up), but to be fair: it does do virtually everything\nand is a lot better than what other Unions have!\n\u201cI promise to stop door charges for entry\nto our own Union.\u201c\nThe awkward one. I wish, when running for election, that I\u2019d been told I had\nno ability to change the Union\u2019s budget for this year: that was set last year.\nCharges were cut at the start of this year, but not enough, I know. I will (in an\nattempt to still act on my promise, yes I know it\u2019s late) propose that the Union\u2019s\nExecutive Committee does everything it can to pass a budget for next year that\ndoesn\u2019t require door charges on a normal Wednesday and Friday night. For\nanyone running for a sabb position this year, do not, without making it clear\nthat it will come into effect the year after, make financial promises \u2013 you\u2019ll feel\nannoyingly helpless like I have this year on this issue. Part of me is still glad I\npromised it, as it now means it will hopefully happen next year, but it\u2019s frustrating all the same. Hopefully by pushing back charging to 21:30 on Wednesdays\nwe\u2019ve afforded most people some extra pints.\n\u201cI promise to put money back in students\u2019\npockets by introducing more student jobs\nin the Union.\u201d\nTwo recruitment sessions have been run so far this year (normally it\u2019d only be\none by now). I\u2019m also planning on introducing more jobs by stealing an idea\nfrom Cambridge Union. They have a brilliant Access programme that both encourages widening participation students into University, and pays their current students to do the presentations and workshops. I\u2019m still working on this,\nbut watch this space!\n\u201cI want the Union to become a place students go to relax throughout the day \u2013 using Metric as a break-out space by day,\nand as a club at night.\u201d\nLights were installed over Summer and lots of people use Metric on a lunchtime for overspill space from FiveSixEight. Not a lot else to say really\u2026\n\u201cI want to make the Union more transparent and better communicate the work it\ndoes for students.\u201d\nI think the new website (where we publish all the Council\u2019s responses to government policy and views on College proposals) goes someway to helping this.\nI also revamped the newsletter though am not writing half as many Felix articles as I\u2019d hoped. I guess people would just get bored anyway. Well done if\nyou\u2019ve made it this far. We\u2019ve invested some more resources into the Union\u2019s\nmarketing recently which should hopefully mean that over the coming years\nthis will improve even more.\neveryone\u2019s, well, horizons (and i s\nbeing rolled out to more\nyears next year). A Union\nreview of PRES data for\nPostgraduate Research\nstudents (the research\nversion of NSS) has\nbeen welcomed and\nwill follow on from our\nNSS Response. Similarly\nfor Becky\u2019s Student Experience survey \u2013\nsomething\nthat the\nCollege\nuses to\nh e l p\ndirect\nr e -sources for developing its support\nservices. Services such as timetabling\n(and improving use of space for\nlectures and labs) are changing;\nsyllabuses are being revised after\nstudent feedback. I\u2019ll stop now.\nIf you think that you\u2019d enjoy effecting change (or, \ufb01ghting behind\nclosed doors) and you\u2019re even just\ncontemplating running as a sabb, drop\nany of the team an email. his year\nthe sabbs are going to be asking\ncandidates questions at\nhustings to make sure\nthey \u2013 and everyone\nvoting \u2013 know what\nthey\u2019re getting themselves in for \u2013 do\ncome talk to us!\nTicks, crosses, and neutral are what Paul thinks.\nHow about you?

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 FRIDAY 18 JANUARY\nInception: the theory of the ring\nLuca De-Benedetti Film Writer\nOk, yes, I am two years late. I am\naware of that. I am also aware of\nthe fact that everyone has now seen\nInception, discussed it, explained\nit and looked for the mathematical\ninconsistencies of the dream world\n(although I suspect the latter is only\ntrue for Imperial students). What\nmore can possibly be said about it after two years?\nWell, there must be something,\nbecause you can be certain that, as a\nmovie conversation grows longer, the\nprobability of someone bringing Inception into it approaches 1 (yes, this\nis my own variation of Godwin\u2019s law).\nObviously Inception is a very original movie, where its storyline entwines and unfold between past and\npresent, dreams and reality, long\ndialogues and James Bond-type action sequences (was the snow scene\nreally necessary?). And certainly the\nimpeccable \ufb01lming, the phenomenal\ncast and the breathtaking special effects contribute towards making this\none of the best \ufb01lms of recent years\nand one which will be remembered.\nNevertheless, after two years people are still racking their brains over\nthe ending, seeking for an answer to\nthe question raised by the last scene.\nWill the spinning top fall? Was he\ntrapped in a dream or did he manage\nto escape Limbo reaching the real\nworld? Is there a workable answer or\nwill Nolan take the mystery to the\ngrave? Will I be able to ever look at\nEllen Page without thinking: \u201cHey!\nIt\u2019s Juno!\u201d?\nI never really hoped to \ufb01nd a de\ufb01nitive answer to any of these questions (although for the last one I\u2019m\npretty con\ufb01dent that the answer is\nno, I won\u2019t). Yet some months ago, in\nan afternoon completely dedicated\nto work, while I was wandering the\ninternet during the sixth or seventh\nhalf an hour break of the day, I ran\ninto a very interesting theory.\nA crazy man with too much free\ntime has noticed a small detail, during what I presume was his 100th\nscreening of the movie. Leonardo\nDiCaprio\u2019s character (Cobb) wears\na wedding ring in every sequence\nin which he wanders through the\ndream world. his ring is however\nabsent when he is awake. Is this the\nde\ufb01nitive distinction between dream\nand reality in the movie?\nhe intriguing part of the theory is\nthat, during the last scene, in which\nhe \ufb01nally see his children again,\nthe ring is not on his \ufb01nger. We can\ntherefore logically conclude that the\nabsence of the ring proves that Cobb\nwasn\u2019t dreaming. Happy ending and\ncase closed.\nBut is it? Having gained knowledge\nof this theory I decided to watch Inception once more. My mind, freed\nfrom the burden of having to understand the intricate plot, was ready\nto concentrate on the small details\nmissed out during the \ufb01rst screening.\nI ended up watching it twice in two\ndays. And I understood that the ring\ntheory is wrong. And actually Inception tells a completely di\ufb00erent story.\nBut let\u2019s try to explain things in an\norderly fashion.\nAt the beginning and for most\nof the movie, Cobb is a character\ngrieved by guilt. Having performed\nInception on his wife during their\nstay in Limbo, implanting deep inside\nher mind the idea that the world she\nwas living in was not real, he became\ndirectly responsible for her death. Indeed, despite the fact that it was the\nright idea, considering where they\nfound themselves, it was implanted\nso deeply into her subconscious that,\neven when they came back to reality,\nit kept growing in her head, persuading her that she was still dreaming\nand leading to her suicide. Because\nof him she was convinced she would\njust wake up.\nIt is this guilt that chains him to\nhis deceased wife. Cobb cannot accept her death, he cannot let her go.\nIn his subconscious he is still married with her. For this reason, in his\ndreams, in the subconscious world,\nhe still wears the ring. Deep inside,\nshe is still his wife.\nFrom there unfold the parallel stories of the heist and of the evolution\nof Cobb\u2019s character and his \ufb01ght to\n\ufb01nd inner peace, which culminates\nin a scene near the end of the movie.\nIn the deeper dream level, just before\nCobb goes to Limbo to rescue Saito,\nhe has a conversation with the mind\nprojection of his wife, in which he\nforsakes the temptation of staying\nwith her. His subconscious acknowledges for the \ufb01rst time that she is just\na projection of his mind, that his real\nwife is gone forever and his real life is\nwith his son and daughter. He takes\nthe conscious (and unconscious)\ndecision of leaving her, leaving the\nmemories behind and freeing himself from his chains.\nFor this reason, in my opinion, the\ntheory of the ring is wrong. For how\nI see it, past that moment Cobb is\nnot haunted anymore by the memory\nof his wife even in his unconscious.\nFrom that moment on, he will not\nwear the ring anymore in his dreams\nnor in the real world. herefore uncertainty left by the last scene stays.\nBut does it really matter? We have\njust seen that Inception is not about a\nmind heist, or, if you prefer, the heist\nis not the main story of the movie.\nhe actual story told by Nolan is the\nAn analysis of the real story told by Nolan\u2019s movie and a different vision of the ending\ninner and emotional path undertaken\nby DiCaprio\u2019s character. In my opin-ion, the key moment of the ending\nscene is not the last shot on the spinning top, which staggers slightly just\nbefore the credits start, but is located\nsome seconds before. Cobb spins the\ntotem but then forgets about it when\nhe sees his children\u2019s faces. He takes\nthe (unconscious?) decision that he\ndoesn\u2019t care anymore if this is dream\nor reality. He reached inner peace,\nwhich is what he was looking for during the whole movie. his is the real\nending of Inception.\nNow, having deceived those who\nbelieved I could provide a meaningful answer to the \ufb01nale, let me just\nsay one last thing. You cannot watch\na good movie only once. Cinema is\nan art so full of small details that it\nmakes it impossible to fully appreciate its beauty in one screening. Inception (like all good movies) is full of\nthem. Some details are essential for\na deeper understanding of the story,\nother are just proof of good writing\nand acting. Small things that, how-ever, make you enjoy the movie a lot\nmore.\nWatch Inception again. Concentrate your attention on the characters and not the plot and I can promise you that, by the end, you\u2019ll feel\nlike you have watched a completely\ndi\ufb00erent movie.\n\n"

Around\nseventy people showed up for the\n\ufb01rst round, in which they had to answer 60 questions set by the makers\nof the show. his was no easy task, as\nthey were ranging very diverse topics\nand going quite in depth in very obscure \ufb01elds. Wannabe quizzers had to\nknow about former counties of Wales,\nopinion columns of the Economist and\nhalf-asteroid, half-comet astronomical bodies. It was a hard set, and only\n17 would be invited again.\nhe second round was structured in\na more familiar, University Challenge\nmanner: teams of four with actual\nworking buzzers would compete for\nstarters for ten and sets of bonuses.\nA rota was established so that the\njudging panel could see everyone and\ndecide who\u2019d make a good UC con-testant: they looked for raw knowl-edge, obviously, but they also had an\neye on impulsiveness, speed on the\nbuzzer, willingness to listen to teammates and ability to guess. he questions came from a variety of sources,\nand ranged from football in Japan to\nImperial Stormtroopers to the Sloan\nGreat Wall. Again, it was not an easy\nquiz and some truly excellent performances were given.\nEventually, though, only \ufb01ve would\nmake onto the team: four contestants\nand a reserve. he following \ufb01ve individuals will be representing Imperial\nCollege in the 2013/2014 season of\nUniversity Challenge: Charlie Yuan,\nthe reserve, in \ufb01rst year biochemistry;\nDaniela Weston, in third year physics;\nGeorge Coombs, in second year phys-ics; Rhys Davies, in \ufb01fth year medi-cine; and their captain, John Wheatley,\nin third year materials science. Hopefully together they have enough facts\nand smarts to bring television glory to\nImperial! he team has already started\npracticing in the London Quiz League\nPietro Aronica Reporter\nwith some success and is meeting every week to \ufb02ex their quizzing muscles.\nSoon they will be invited by the makers of the show in a quiz/interview,\nwhich will determine if they make it\nto the televised portion. We have no\ndoubt they will, and we will be looking forward to their matches starting\nfrom July next year.\nIn case you missed the selections or\nwere not chosen, they are run every\nyear, and you can try again come next\nNovember. In the meantime, the Imperial Quiz Society organises quizzes,\nwhere you might help this year\u2019s team\npractice.\nContact them at quiz@imperial.ac.uk.\nBeat that Bristol, oh, wait, you tried but couldn\u2019t. Sorry\n\n"
