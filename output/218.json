The rocks rise almost\nsheer from an average bottom\nlevel of 180 feet down. That is\ntoo deep for the average club\ndiver but the chart did show a narrow ridge 50 to 100 feet deep\nextending about 300 yd s. out to\nthe West-south-west of the light.\nThe ridge turned out to be very\nnarrow and took some finding.\nEventually we anchored satis-factor i ly, keeping a wary eye on\nthe distance to the rocks, only\n150 yd s away, and proceeded to\ndive.\nAbundant Life\nAs always where there arc\nrocks there is an abundance of\nmarine life. Many of the fish\nseen were larger than the fish\nwe saw in the Mediterranean\nat Easter. We had anchored in\nsome sixty feet of water and this\nis the depth that most people\nreached. One pair went straight\ndown from the boat, which is not,\nof course, directly above the\nanchor but some 250 feet away,\nrather than down the anchor\nrope. The water here was 95\nfeet deep and very clear below 80\nfeet which seemed to be the lower\nlimit of the algae belt.

Professors.\nThe dinner, consisting almost\nentirely of Indian dishes, was\nenjoyed by all and followed by\nreasonably short and interesting\nspeeches.

Much advanced speculation had been made\nabout this event with ticket prices crashing from 25/- to 5/- per double\non \" Wall Street,\" I.C. There was then a quick run on English currency and the week\nended with a \u00a360 deficit to the union.

The Jazz-band\nwas of a very high standard and\ninvoked people to dance of sexual\nsymbolism at sporadic intervals.\nAt quarter to nine the whistle\nwent for half time when the band\nand the boats changed ends. The\ncaptain disappeared to the bar on\nhearing that West Ham had\nscored a second goal, leaving the\nboat in the incapable hands of\nPresident Price's girlfriend.\nBAND VANISHED\nAt this juncture the band\nvanished downstairs to avoid flying glasses projected from the\nriverside pubs. A few people remained on the top deck to absorb\nand filter the cool night air, while\nthe rest sat or danced in the lower\nlounge in an atmosphere of unrestrained chatter.\nAs a side show, Ian Craig and\nPete Metcalfe took on all comers\nat a beer-can-bending competition\nand accompanied the band with\nthe remains. Thus the boat arrived at the pier with everybody\ncompletely satisfied with their 5/-s worth and I am sure they would\nlike me to give a vote of thanks to\nPhil Dean and his crew for their\nefforts.\nB.M AIR Every Sunday, The Observer Is fall of the best kind of\nvocational guidance.

This record accumulated\nafter a shaky beginning to the\nterm, marred by illness and a period without any coaching, is\nan indication of the potential of\nthe VIII being realised. Wailingford Regatta marked the first\nwin by an I.C. first VIII in an\nopen regatta for four years ; in\nthis event the crew lowered the\nprevious best time by 27 sees\nfrom 5 min. 11 sec. to 4 m.44 sees.\nSecond Eight\nSuccesses\nThe second VIII have also\nbeen rowing well, and, in fact, got\noff to a faster start than the 1st VIII, having reached the final\nof Junior-Senior VIIFs at Putney\nregatta, winning at Twickenham\nregatta and performing quite\ncreditably at Thames Ditton and\nin the Vesta Dashes.\nThe third VIII as yet have no\nsilverware to show but under the\nastute care of Tony Blench they\nare improving steadily and are\nexpected to win in the near\nfuture.

The highlight of the season was the winning of Division\nII of the London Chess League,\nthus gaining promotion to Division I. The London League Division I is the strongest in the\ncountry, with a high proportion\nof Britain's leading players taking part. As the College was\nonly promoted from Division III\nthree years ago, it makes the\nachievement all the more note-worthy. The final record was\nP.9,W.6, D.2,L.l.

The 1st team defeated their closest rivals University College \u2014 1 | in the final\nmatch of the season. At the end\nof season, Imperial College\nplayed the Rest of London University over 20 boards, and the\nprobable result is a10 \u201410 draw,\ntwo games have gone to an adjudicator for a decision.\nThe Club was aided towards\nthe latter end of the season by\nthe Italian Chessmaster S Bouzzie who came to the College\nafter Christmas.\nSpecial mention must be given\nto J.

In defence\nof this low position it should be\nstated that the team used a hired\nrifle, the bolt of which tended to\ncome open every time a shot was\nfired.

This is the\nthird year that I.C. has played\nsummer games and on on Tuesday, 18th May, played the first\nmatch this term, versus the\nELIZABETHANS. The pitch at\nHarlington was in very good condition despite recent rain and the\ngame was played at a fast pace,\nthe final result being 2\u20141 to the\nvisitors. I.C.'s goal was scored\nby the inside left Mackenzie,\nwhose reverse stick shot was just\ninside the post. This was unfortunately the visiting goalkeeper's sole mistake, he made several\ngood saves from Hough and\nStenning, in the last quarter of\nthe match. It was, in any case\nno disgrace to lose so narrowly\nto a side containing a present\nWelsh international and 2 county\nplayers.\nGORDON\nLOWES\nTHE IDEAL SPORTS SHOP\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL I.C. MEMBERS\n173-174 SLOANE ST.,\nS.W.I Tel. BEL 8484\nIN TOUCH Value for Money?\nAn average year. Only three sports clubs have produced a standard of performance expected of a college of this size. The\nBadminton, Hockey and Judo clubs have swept all before them and\ncongratulations must go to them, both for their performances and\nthe excellent reports for Felix. The output of outstanding individuals\nis correspondingly low. Leon Hall now high-jumping 6ft. lin.\nrecently won the high-jump for London University against A.A.A.( admittedly Gordon Miller was not competing). Stapely of the I.C. and B.U.S. F. Water Polo teams is also of potential international\nclass. The Lawn Tennis Club is also now emerging as a force to\nreckon with\u2014containing two County players Fitzgerald and Long.\nWhat has happened to the \" big three \"\u2014Soccer, Rugby and\nBoats ? The former has won so much for so long that it will not,\nperhaps, do the club any harm to have something to fight for. However, the chances of obtaining another player with the ability of\nBasil James seem to get less every year. The Rugby Club has done\nquite well and was a little unlucky in the U..L. Cup competition, but\nthere now exists the nucleus for a really great team, for which much\nof the credit must go to Havard and Turner.\nThe Boat Club has not been particularly inspiring for the last\ncouple of years, but now seems to be showing promising signs.\nOf the rest, only Fives shows any indication of life. To Felix\nand hence the College in general the Fencing, Squash, Cricket, Sailing,\nVolley-ball and Women's Sports Clubs are virtually non-existent.\nThe Chairman of ACC only hears from the Volley-ball Club when\nfinancial assistance is required.\nAlthough (as Mr. Jenkins would say) we are not a profit-making\ninstitution we ought to be getting more returns for the \u00a34,500 injected\nannually into the ACC clubs.\n\n"

This in itself shows monumental irresponsibility on his part, since we have 100 copies to sell and Mr. Williams has\ngiven it such a great recommendation at the outset.\nThe most infuriating aspect of his review however, is that it is\ntotally unfair and misleading. Everyone who has heard the test\npressing is agreed tli at it is the best record produced in this College to\ndate, both musically and in the quality of recording. Even Mr.\nWilliams- must agree that it would be downright stupidity to expect\nabsolute perfection in a record of this nature so why must he be\nso uncharitable. Minor flaws there are, of course, but for someone of\nMr. Williams' limited knowledge\nof Folk Music to accuse Derek\nHall of poor timing is absurd.\nNeither are his remarks about the\nEcho Mountain Boys ' diction\nvalid, the words are perfectly\nclear and audible.

Sc.W. voiced in a letter in Felix of May 12th. These criticisms\nimplied that the A. Sc.W. Branch was adopting resolutions outside its\nterms of reference and by our Rules, I, as secretary, am charged with\nthe responsibility for seeing that this does not occur.\nThe present Branch Rules were drawn up by a sub-committee of\nfour academic staff members in 1950 and they wrote into the Rules\nthe \" Right of members to raise any matter relevant to the aims of\nthe Association at a General Meeting.\" This right we cherish and\nhence any motion can be brought forward.\nThe aims of the Association under which the motions were\nbrought forward were:\n(1) To secure the wider application of science and the scientific method\nfor the welfare of society;\n(2) To watch over promote and\nprotect the common and individual interests of its members.\nAs always it is for our members\nto decide at a general meeting\nwhether they do or do not support\nthese resolutions or any others\nthat may be brought forward.

Mr. Anand's\" ICSFRE \"\u2014\nwhatever that may stand for\" provoked some amusement. In pro-proposing a vote of thanks for all that President Price had done this\nyear, Chris Tye exposed the little-known fact that he had carried\nout his duties in spite of no grant.\nHALDANE LIBRARY\n13, Prince's Gardens\nSorry!

The\non lv one fool enough to accept\nthis invitation was last seen entering a South Side lavatory, ostensibly to drink a cup of coffee.\nFor some unknown reason,\nwater was thrown from the Hall\nwindows, which appears to have\ndow s, which appears to have\nsame time, four drunk men\nemerged from the mews, shouting obscenities up to the Tizard\nresidents.\nA woman also emerged from\nthe mews\u2014to complain that the\nnoise had woken her baby.

Dickie Gash, President-elect Mines Dai Howell, President-elect C&G by President SADHVANI\nHere comes the end of yet another session with the exception\nof exams in the near future to plough through. Now to summarise\non the year's activities, which have been from moderate to brilliant,\nnothing less. The year started with the usual run of fresher s' dinners\nand inter-mascot ry sport. The serious sports on Morphy Day and\nSwimming Gala didn't quite do justice to a college of our size, but\non the light-heated side, we, as usual, came out tops.\nLater, during the year, our athletes showed that we only had a temporary relapse. Well done, Soccer Club, for winning the Imperial College Technology Cup, and the Athletic Club for winning\n1 out of 13 possible cups on Sports Day.\nIn other clubs and societies all had a successful season. One\nworth mentioning is the Chemical Society which sent a representative\nto a Congress of the Communaute Europeanne Culturalle des\nEtudiants en Chemie at Zurich. He turned out to be, in fact, the\nonly representative from England. As a result, plans are being\nmade for a Congress to be held here in 1966. A proud position for\nthe Society.\nThe Motor Club has been overworking in the complete renovation of our mobile mascot Jezebel and should finish pretty soon.\nIts absence has been felt strongly and the production of the Pedal\nCar Jezette, which did very well activities with n and splash in\nat Bristol, has helped to temporarily substitute Jezebel. A very good effort.\nAs a sideline, the R.C.S. Film\nUnit was out to shoot the Pedal\nCar Race and returned with a magnificent movie due to the\nefforts of Nick Coope. The Union\nwill always be proud of this ven-ture.\nOn the social side, an evening\nwas arranged with a teacher training college in Tooting and pleasant\nmemories of the successful evening\nstill linger.\nThe Entertainments Committee\nhas excelled itself again in providing I.C. with the best Carnival\nnight and Smoking Concert. Silwood Ball, as the highlight is yet\nto come this Friday.\nThe important addition to the\nyear's events on the Calendar was\na very successful R.C.S. Annual\nDinner. An event, which seemed\nto fill a long awaited gap in the\nUnion Social activities and I hope\nwill in time be established as the\nhighlight of the year.\nAt the Annual General Meeting\nheld two weeks ago, next year's President Mike Scott and VicePresident, Ken West, were elected,\nthe Round Pond.\nOn the whole, tiny year has\nbeen a year of st a bilis ation and\nstrengthening of the Royal College of Science Union spirit into\none that will outclass everything\nnext year to put it back to its\nright position in I.C. Guildfinger\nDavid Bishop's Presidential\nyear is over. Much has happened in these last few months,\nsome of it good, and some not so\ngood. Those of you who were\nFreshers at the beginning will\nremember the turmoil of\nFreshers' Day, when Guilds\nUnion presented three hours of\ntelevision.\nThen there were the Freshers'\nDinners, a good feast, but sometimes marred by weak support in\nthe bar afterwards. Modifications to improve the dinners\nhave been considered, and a recommendation made for next\nyear's executive to consider.\nIn these early days, Theta was\nborrowed, but Spanner was for-tun at ely, less inclined to stray.\nMorphy Day resulted in a towpath win for Guilds, and two\ngood wins in the races. Bo ran\nto Brighton in excellent time,\nhaving received a royal send-off\nfrom Hyde Park. This year's Lord Mayor's Show was Guildsmen-enriched to a greater extent\nthan in the past. Stanley Tools\nwere well pleased with the free\npublicity that enterprising Guildsmen obtained for their product,\nand presented the Union with an\n8ft. Spanner.\nand the meet r.7 ended the year's Sadhvani\u2014Sad farewell\nThis year's Union Meetings\nhave been professionally handled\nand well attended. Besides the\nmore serious business, there has\nbeen a Fashion Show, a Pantomies, a Festival of Music and\nCulture, a secret listening in to\nan R.C.S. Union Meeting, diverse\ntapes, and the very successful 20\nminute film \" Only a Game in a Guilded Box.\"\nTwo informal dinners with the\nDean and the Heads of Department in Guilds have been held,\nand led to much closer StaffUnion co-operation. The Colours\nSub-committee has been recon-st it uti one d, as has the academic\nSub-committee. This is perhaps\none of the best innovation this\nyear, for academic matters affect\neveryone (although some will not\nadmit to the truth of this) and\nthis year's academic report under\nChris Molam's guidance promises\nto be more comprehensive and\nworthwhile than its predecessors.\nThe Old Centralians have\nagain taken a keen interest in the\naffairs of the Union, and Sherry\nParties have been held for 2nd and 3rd year men. The various\nentertainment functions have\nbeen excellently organised this\nyear by the Ents. Committee. The\nEngineers' Dinner and Dance deserves special mention being sans\npared.\nIn the sporting sphere, the\nstatistics are dismal. At hockey\n(Stephenson Cup), Tennis (Brown\nCup). Soccer (Tech. Cup), Rifle\nShooting (Courtman Shield), and\nRugby (Sparkes Cup) Guilds lost\nto either R.C.S. or Mines. Guilds\ndid however retain the Morphy\nand Lowry Cups (rowing) and the\nSwimming Gala, plus winning the\nGovernors' Shield for Athletics\nfor the first time since 1959.\nThe year reps, the unsung\nbackbone of the Union, have\nworked extremely hard this year,\nwith the result that more people\nhave taken an interest in the\nUnion. And if you want any\nmore information, it's all in Spanner, now on sale and price only\nBrian King\n\n"

We took a total of about \u00a34,300, and spent some\n\u00a31,700, which is not much considering that this includes the price of\nthe raffled Hillman Imp, won by J.R. Birtwhistle, Mech. Eng. III.\nOne thing, however, has marred what would have been a most\nsuccessful raffle ; this was the large number of raffle ticket stubs\nnot returned on time. While the collection system is open to improve-ment, it is ultimately the responsibility of the people who sell the\ntickets to ensure that the subs are returned in time for the draw. If\nthey do not, they are in effect \" taking money under false pretences.\"\nWe have received a small but\nsteady stream of stubs ever since\nthe draw, but it is hoped that the\nfuture years will not see this performance repeated.\nOne suggestion for next year is\nthat a system of Carnival Year\nReps., should be nominated by\nthe constituent Union Year Reps.\nThis would, we think help a great\ndeal in matters like raffle tickets,\nand in general public ising Carnival.\nOn the final day of the Carnival,\nthe processions made \u00a3180 and\nthe fe te \u00a3230, but it is unfortunate\nthat some \u00a315 will have to be spent\nin moving the wrecked car from\nPrincess Gardens. It was not an\nofficially authorised \" stall \" and it\nis a pity that the Carnival should\nhave to take the blame for a few\npeople's irresponsibility in failing\nto clear up the mess.\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the\nCarnival Committee, I would like\nto thank all who helped in manning the Carnival\u2014there are far\ntoo many to recognise individually. But the organisers of the\nseparate events in Carnival week,\nand Bruce Copper with his Commandos must stand out from the\ncrowd. Without people's help\nCarnival just wouldn't exist, and\nthis year we have again succeeded\nin proving that it does.\nHUGH AINSLEY.\nDON'T FORGET\nAll copy (especially clubs' summer tours) for publication in the\nfirst issue of Felix for the autumn\nterm must reach the Felix Editor,\nc/o Union on or before 28\nSeptember.\nIf you are rejoicing in the fact that your grant will next year\nrise by some \u00a330, then think again. For rumours have been circulating among hall committees over suggested fine deposits of up to\n\u00a325 payable at the start of the academic year. This comes as one\nsolution to the problem of setting punishment short of expulsion from\nHall and stronger than a reprimand.\nTizard began a system of expulsion from hall for a short period\nsuch as a neck, a plant which has been copied by other South Side\nHalls. Other suggestions have included the inconvenience of reporting to Wardens at various times of the day or fines.\nAt the Beit meeting on Monday, 17th May, the suggestions was\nput for a deposit to be placed at the beginning of term by all res i dents. For his (or her) mis demean ours the students would lose a proportion of his deposits, which when finally cleared would have\nto be replenished or the student would be thrown out of hall.\nFigures ranging from \u00a310\u2014\u00a320 were suggested on this occasion\nas suitable deposits, but it was pointed out that especially in the\nChristmas term students could not afford such a financial burden. For this is the time when book bills are highest, a \u00a35 breakage\ndeposit in the departments has to be paid by all fresher s and key\ndeposits are due. On top of this some money must be put aside for\nthe holiday period if only for buying Christmas presents.

Due to a wide range of interesting activities the Society has\nachieved a much increased mem-ber ship.

ASTARDJIAN\nNew Club\nTo Help\nYouth\nThe summer term may not,\nfrom a numerical standpoint, be\nthe ideal time for starting a new\nsociety. The I.C. Youth Council\nhas had what might be termed a cautious start to its life, only nine\nattending its inauguration. However, this does not I feel represent the true feelings of I.C. students on the topic of Youth\nWork.\nWell, why a Youth Council?\nSince it will have close contact\nwith the voluntary youth organisations in London, it can help here\nby offering a full range of club\nwork. The Youth Council will\nhold regular meetings and\nthrough the U.L. U. Youth Council provide short training courses\nfor those wishing to enter this\nfield of social service.\nBriefly, above are some of the\nreasons why I.C. should have a Youth Council all that is now\nrequired is your help. So, if you\nintend to be around college next\nyear, and the idea of a Youth\nCouncil appeals to you, write to\nPhil Henser (Elec. Eng. 2 or via\nUnion Rack).\nR.H. JAZZ CLUB\n- BUSY PLANNING\nThe Jazz Club, far from being\nstruck by the summer apathy experienced in most clubs, is now\nbusy planning its activities for\nnext year. These will include\nrecord recitals and talks on prominent jazz personalities, jazz\nevenings and concerts featuring\nprofessional jazz groups, and, of\ncourse, midweek jazz stomps.\nMembership of the club will\nagain be open to non-musicians,\nand generous reductions will be\navailable to members at all meet-in gs. One of the biggest problems\nevery year in the jazz club is the\nshortage of musicians\u2014specific\nmusicians. In common with the\nrest of Britain we are at present\nvery short of rhythm sections, i.e. pianists, bass players, and drum-mers. If you play one of these\ninstruments, but have been hiding\nmodestly, now is the time to appear (or early next term). The\npresent strength and success of the\nJazz Club depends on its\nmusicians. Whether we can maintain or improve our standing may\ndepend on you.\nAL HIGSON\nAN\nOPEN\nINVITATIONS The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank THE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"

Courses are\ndesigned to enable men from different departments and\ncompanies to see the steel industry in perspective, to\nincrease their technical and commercial knowledge, to meet\nleading figures in the industry and to practise committee\nwork. These courses also help them to develop their capacity\nfor solving management problems, both human and technical and occasionally to study specialist techniques, such\nas Industrial Market Research and Systems Analysis.\nThe Steel industry regards management as both an Art and\na Science. In addition to its intensive programme of management training, the Federation is currently engaged in a substantial programme of research into management\nproblems within the industry.\nSteel gives a man the opportunity\nto rise by ability and achievement,\nirrespective of age, in one of\nBritain's biggest manufacturing\nindustries.
