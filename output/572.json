    "content": "mmm Nobody solved the chess puzzle (I warned you\nit was difficult) and the only person to get the\nother three right was Roland Marslin,\nPhysics 3, and he wins a total of \u00a314 in prizes.\nRoland was the only person to get Silent Audit\ncorrect; incredibly he solved it without cl\ncorrection slip.\nThere were several correct replies to the\nother two puzzles. Open Fire was won by\nJasper of IC Radio, and Santa Clues by David\nBogle of Chem Eng. They can collect \u00a32 each\nfrom the FELIX Office.\nThanks and congratulations to everyone\nwho entered, and especially to Stephen Harris\nand Katharine Herbert who did better than\nmost, but were unlucky in the draw.\nOpen Fire\nTen missiles are needed. The diagram shows a symmetric solution.\nAs I intended, it's easy to find a solution with\nten missiles, and even easier to convince\nyourself it is possible with nine missiles. It isn't.o ooo ooo ooo Santa Clues\nPrancer drinks Arctic Lite, and Dasher sings\n'Hark The Herald Angels Sing'. These are the\nonly possibilities for the information I asked\nfor, although it isn't possible to allocate all the\nattributes to the reindeer uniquely. One solution is:\nDasher Blitzen Rudolf Donner Prancer\nPurple Green Red Yellow Blue\nRibbons PackssleighBells Sack Lights\nPort Gin Rum Whiskey Arctic Lite\nHark Silent NightJingle Bells WhileShep O Come\nwith the reindeer harnessed in this order, with\nDasher at the back, and Prancer at the front.\nKamikaze Chess\nLet's start with some basic observations about\nthe position.\n1. Obviously neither side will make any\npawn move.\n2. If White moves his black-square bishop,\nBlack can play B xB check, forcing K Nl, and\nnow White's position is hopeless.\n3. If White moves his rook off the back\nrank, Black can move his black-square bishop,\nand again White cannot now force Black to do\nanything.\n4. If White permits (or forces) Black to play\nB xB check at any time, he must make sure his\nrook is not in a position to block the check.\nFor instance 1.B B6 Bx Bch is no good, because of 2.R N2.\nPutting all this together, we see that White\nmust shuttle his Bishop up and down the\ndiagonal, and his rook back and forth along the\nback rank (making sure it is always either\nbehind his bishop, or else on the 'safe'\nsquare, KR8) until he can force Black to play\nB xB mate.\nForming this strategy is the first part of the\nproblem, and it's no small achievement to do\nso; congratulations if you got this far. But\nworse is to come, since in deciding the best\ntactics, you have to consider what are the best\ncounter-tactics for Black.\nIt's done like this:\nIn the diagram I have put numbers on\ncertain squares of the board. Black's best play\nis as follows.\n1. If possible, play B xB without giving mate.\n2. If this is not possible, make sure that the\nnumber of vacant squares between the two\nwhite-square bishops is equal to the number of\nthe square on which the white rook stands.\nBlack will be able to achieve one of these\naims as soon as (and only if) White makes a slip.\nWhite's best play is similar.\n1. Make sure that the number of vacant\nsquares between the two white-square bishops\nis equal to the number of the square on which\nthe rook stands.\n2. Never move the rook from a lower to a higher numbered square. This will eventually\nforce Black to play B xB mate.\nAll rather complicated, so here are a couple\nof examples. In the first, White blunders on his\nfirst move.\nB K5\nB Q4\nB B3\nB N2 and White is\nr BxB\n)-B2 he cannot force Black\n1. R QB8\n2. B B3\n3. B K4\n4. B Q5\nstuck, since after\n5. B B6\n6. RxB B(N to mate him.\nThis is how it should be done.\n1. RK B8B Q4 (there's nothing better\nfor Black)\n2. R Q8 B B3\n3. B B3 B N24.B K4 B B3\n5. R QB8 B N26.B Q5 B B3\n7. R R8 B N28.B B6 B xB mate\nSilent Audit\n99V2 p,98V2 P,95V2p,90 y2 p,50V2p, V2 p. Of the four s worded puzzles, this one was\nunquestionably the most s worded of all, although the idea behind it is extremely simple.\nThe point is that although each monk tendered\n\u00a31, they didn't all offer a \u00a31 note. And so the\nshopkeeper was able to deduce, for instance,\nthat a monk who offered 50+10+10+10+10+10\npence wanted a candle costing more than 90p. In fact, the smallest coin tendered defines a limit to the amount of change expected.\nNow, we know they all wanted differently\nsized candles, so the shopkeeper could only\nmake his deductions if the smallest coins\ntendered by each of the six were different.\nLet us make a table of possibilities:\nSmallest Coin Minimum Prize\nTendered\n'/2p Ip\n2p5p lOp\n50p \u00a31\nof Candle\n\u00a31\n99V2p98>/2 p9sy2 P9ov2 p S0'/jp\nV2P Max Change\nGiven\nnil\n'/2P IV2 P4'/2P9'/2P49>/2p99>/ zP\nSo the maximum amount of change the\nshopkeeper could possibly have given was\nV2+lV2+41/2+91/2+491/2+991/2= \u00a31.65.\nBut we are told that he did hand out \u00a31.65 in\nchange. So the amounts handed in change to\nthe individual monks were V2P, IV2P. 472P,9V2 P,49V2P. and 99V2p which determines the\nprices of candles as 99V2 P,98'/2P>95V2 p,9OV2 P.50V2P, and V2P (this last one presumably for a birthday cake).\nI hope this is enough of an explanation; it's by no means as complete as it might be, but to\ngo into greater detail would be unnecessarily\ntedious. But if anyone still doesn't understand,\nwrite to me at the usual address and I 'll send\nyou a really detailed solution.\nAlso, I hope that everyone got a correction\nsheet to say that the amount of change was\n\u00a31.65, not \u00a31.66. That mistake cost me my\nsecond consecutive night's sleep, but for such\na lovely puzzle (adapted from a Tantalizer by\nMartin Hollis) it was worth it.\nCompiled by Phil Webb\nACC\nThe next general meeting of ACC will be\nTuesday, January 13, 1981 in the Bot/Zoo\nCommon Room.

    "content": "Letters to the Editor Dear Steve\nWith reference to the letter\nconcerning maths staff in the\nChristmas issue of FELIX. Our feelings on reading this\nletter were ones of shock \u2014 as 'a bolt out of the blue' doesn't go\nhallway to describing the surprise\nof this attack \u2014 and disgust at\nthis unsigned display of back-stabbing. The many other maths\nstudents with whom we have\ndiscussed this letter feel similarly.\nIf this person is dissatisfied\nwith Dr Pitman' s teaching, he/she should first have done at\nleast one of the following:\n1 Seen Dr Pitman himself.\n2 Seen the Senior Tutor in\nmaths.\n3 Seen his/her academic rep\nand had his/her grievance aired\nat staff/student committee.\nHad all these failed to achieve\nanything, we still feel that an\nanonymous letter to FELIX is not a reasonable course of action.\nVarious people, students and\nstaff, have worked hard to\nimprove relations within the\nmaths department. These relations are in general good and we\nrealise that if they deteriorate, it\nis the students who will lose out\nmost.\nWe hope that if there is any\nhard feeling within the staff at\nthe moment, it will be dispelled.\nTours\nMike Booty, Maths Dep Rep Kirsten Pratt, former Maths Dep\nRep\nMary Attenborough, former Maths De pRep Ed's Note\nI printed the letter originally\nbecause I thought it was a pleasant change for someone to\nactually have the courage of his\nconvictions and sign the letter ( K Barry). To the best of my knowledge the letter wasn't anonymous. I was not to know\nthat there was no such person in\nCollege. I especially did not\nknow, as Mr Booty pointed out to\nme as if I were an ignoramus,\nthat K Barry was a member of\nthe IRA. Why, the snivelling\nlittle pratt!\nMark you me, if he should\nbring another little offering in. 1\nshall squeeze his testicles to a pulp.\nYou can have faith in me\nMike, Kirsten and Mary, saviours\nof all that is decent.\nDear Sir\nMany people reading the\nletters in the last issue of FELIX may have concluded that five of\nthe letters originated from members of the IRA, four of\nwhom were dead.\nFrom personal experience I can say that these people are not\nin the IRA. I think it would be a bad habit for FELIX to publish\nso many letters under false\nnames. I hope this will soon\ncease.\nTours faithfully\nG Tuite\nPrivate and Confidential\nDear Steve\nIt has been brought to my\nattention that in FELIX570( page 3), you have contravened\nSection2( i) of the FELIX Constitution\" to express the\nviews and opinions of the students of Imperial College, both individually and collectively,\ni.e. in terms of decision reached\nat Union General Meetings . . .\"\nIn the U GM report in FELIX570 you have distorted the\nmotion passed on the FELIX Editor, and as such, I must ask\nyou to print a true and accurate\nreport of that meeting. I hope\nthat you take note of the motion\nwhich was passed overwhelmingly at aUG M and will in future publish FELIX in accord ance with its constitution.\nFailure to do so will, Iam sure,\nresult in further action.\nTours sincerely\nJohn Passmore\nPresident\nImperial College Union Ed's Note\nYour accusation is a disgrace to\nyour office, sir!\nI challenge you to point out\nany falsehood in the U GM report\nfeatured in FELIX570. Dear Steve\nI'd just like to say thank you to\neveryone who helped make the\nRag Conference a success, especially Nick Watmough, Jim Sarsfield and Caroline God in. Tours sincerely\nBarney McCabe Dear Mr Marshall\nMiss Snee writes in FELIX571 that she was surprised that\nSecurity think she has the key to\nthe J CR Cleaning Cupboard.\nI base my thinking on the fact\nI hat some eight weeks ago, on her\nrequest I gave her the key.\nTwo weeks later in the Ante\nRoom, Sherfield Building, I told\nher the key had not been\nreturned. She said it had been\ngiven to a third party but she\nwould make sure it was returned\nIt never was. Since that time all\nrequests for the key have been\nreferred to Miss Snee.\nI wonder has Miss Snee lost\nher memory, the key or both?\nTours faithfully\nRobert Dickens\nSuperintendent Security\nSir\nThe current campaign that is\nabout to take place in the pages\nof FELIX concerning ^he next\nChancellor of the University of\nLondon is disgraceful.\nHow could any sane person\nhave the temerity and insensibility to oppose Her Royal Highness Mrs Anne Phillips for\nthis post? What worse, one of the\ncandidates is that left ic Jack Jones, an ex TUC hack who isn't even a member of the House of\nLords. It wouldn't be so bad if it\nwere Lord Vic of the Feather, or\neven Viscount Scargill.\nExcluding the fact that she will\nnot be as good a chancellor as her\nGrandmother would be at\nshow jumping, and that she is\nmarried to a stammering imbecile,\nthere is no lawful impediment\nwhy she should not be honoured\nin that way.\nOf course, the strain of being\nin such a position is such that\nonly royalty, or myself could bare\nit, so I shall end this passionate\nplea for Princess Anne to be\nelected by adopting a phrase that\nwas first aimed at Sen Muskie\nwhen he lost a primary in the\n1972 US Elections\" Vote for\nAnne, or she'll cry\".

    "content": "Rag Conference\nHeld At IC\nICU were the hosts of the 1980 Rag Conference during the\nChristmas vacation. Unfortunately, the FELIX man on the spot,\nBB Wolffe, was called away on urgent business and so was\nunable to write a report. Nevertheless, FELIX presents the\nfollowing report:\nIt was a dark Tuesday afternoon on December 16, as delegates from\nall over Britain, and from Hemel Hempstead, converged on Imperial\nCollege to confer on the popular subject of Rag. During the two and a half hour registration period Barney McCabe, R CSU pianist, P WP resident comedian and contender for a post as\nUnion bar cleaner next year was to be seen frantically organising in a last minute dash. However, the delegates were ready in line for a super\nslap up Mooney dinner, which lasted for exactly one hour. Then there\nfollowed \" drinking\" in the Union Bar, from which several delegates\nwere forcibly ejected, and others left of their own accord, bitterly\ncomplaining about the high price of beer, and the capitalist thugs who\nimpose such prices.\nDogs Attack Delegates\nUnfortunately whilst returning from the Union Bar to Southside,\nwhere the guests were accommodated in the most luxurious of\nsurroundings, two delegates were attacked by a pack of dogs, which\nhad been roaming Exhibition Road. The people were rushed to\nhospital, but the dogs refused to go.\nWednesday was a glorious day when the sun shone, the wind blew,\nand the rain rained it) that order. After a one and a half hour Mooney\nbreakfast, the delegates were introduced and simultaneously heard a meditation on Rag from the Bishop of London, the Rt Revd G Ellis.\nThe Charities Committee then gave a talk on the difference between\nthe Kaisers left elbow and spoons.\nIn the afternoon, the delegates who by now included W Rees-Mogg,\nwere given a very severe talking to by the police, who had broken off a recording session especially for the occasion. The business part of the\nday concluded with a talk on publicity, given by a publican. After a slap-up Mooney meal, including THE baked mince beef roll, delegates\nand Lord Flowers social is ed on a pub crawl around some local\ndrinking houses.\nFood Poisoning\nThursday began with a talk on \" Everything you've always wanted\nto kr rb w about McMillan and Graham... and alternatives, but were\ntoo frightened to ask\". This was so scandalous that I refuse to lower the\ntone of the article by enlarging on it.\nAfter lunch, delegates paid a visit to the sales, and bought or\nshoplifted assorted articles of clothing, and beer glasses.\nThe Rag Conference Revue, scheduled for that evening was\ncancelled, owing to all participants having food poisoning. An extra\nitem, however, was added to the programme, Lord Denning spoke on\nthe interpretation of the Law with respect to Rag Magazines from\n1808, when he got his First Class Maths Degree, to the present day.\nOn Friday morning a discussion was held on CRIB, which I think\nmeans Criminal Research and Information Bureau, and seems a silly\nthing to talk about.\nThe conference ended on a happy note as Mr Mooney handed out\nspecial \" Vic' ll Fix It\" badges.\nI have been unable to research fully what the delegates had for\nbreakfast, as the Breakfast Bar ladies can't understand any English\nexcept \"sausages\". Captain Lindley was asked how many delegates\nwere at the conference but said \" I don't know, I don't stand and count\n'em, and it's not up to me to count 'em either\".\nRag Chairman Dead\nIan Hodgeson, this year's Rag Chairman wouldn't know anything\nHE WASN'T EVEN THERE!( Neither was Sir James Goldsmith\nwhose news magazine ' Now!' certainly is a rag). When Barney\nMcCabe realised that the conference was a total flop and would\nseriously damage his chances of becoming Union Bar Cleaner next\nyear, he said: \" I don't know what I 'll do, I think I 'll stand for ICU Deputy President\".\nSome of this report may be true, but the rest of it isn't. Telephone Extension\nIT SEEMS likely that the\ninternal phone system will be\nextended to Evelyn Gardens in\nthe very near future. Mr Burridge\nof the College Estates department\nhas told FELIX that the claim\nfor a tie line has been with the\nGPO for a month now, and that\nas soon as it is granted it is a simple matter to hook a phone on\nthe end.\nInitially, only one phone line\nwill be provided, to Bernard Sunley House, which will enable\nthe housekeeper of Evelyn Gardens to keep in contact with\nCollege. The phone will be\nsituated near the housekeeper's flat and will be available for the\nuse of students of all the Evelyn\nGardens houses.\nOn a less optimistic front, the\nphone system in the Southside\nHalls of Residence has still not\nbeen connected to the internal\nphone system. This work should\nhave been completed by the start\nof October but the contracted\nfirm, Reliance, seem less than Re li able. All that needs to be done to\ncomplete the system is that one\nconnection needs to be made\nwhich could be done by College\nelectricians in a day if it were not\nfor the fact that such an \"irresponsible\" action would render\nthe contract er not liable for any\nfuture fault that might develop.\nWhen connected, there would be\njust one internal to Southside\nconnection (and vice-versa). IC\nRadio aim to put this connection\nto good use as Southside residents\nwould be able to phone the\nstation directly from their landing. The system may be\nextended to the other Halls if it\npasses satisfactorily.\nIranian\nAbomination\nTOWARDS the end of last term\na large number of posters written\nin Iranian were stuck on walls\naround College and various West\nEnd Underground stations with\nan extremely strong adhesive.\nThe poster depicted scenes of\nbattle with the only English script being the address of Imperial College Union. This is\nnot the first time this abhorrent\nadvertising technique has been\nused to deface College walls and\nshops in Kensington and the\nWest End; remnants of others\nmay still be seen etched onto the\nwalls in Kensington High Street\n\u2014 all bearing the address of IC Union in English. The latest\noutrage was brought to the\nattention of the President. John Passmore, by FELIX after discovering one gracing its own\nwalls. After translation, it was\ndiscovered to advertise an event\nstaged by IC Iranian Society on\nDecember 13, 1980 in the Union Building.\nAn executive meeting was held\nwhich decided to fine the Iranian\nSociety \u00a310 for use of adhesive\ninstead of Blu-tac and the more\nserious lack of an English translation; both contraventions\nof Union policy. (See Editorial.)\nPressure of\nAcademic Work\nMR PHILLIP COLL has resigned from his post on the Union Council as External Affairs Officer. Phil told John Passmore\nof his decision last Monday and\nexplained that it was due to\n\"pressure of academic work\".\nLabour\non Fees\nMR NEIL KINNOCK, the\nopposition spokesman for edu-cation has announced at the\nannual conference of the World University Service ( WU S) that\nthey will be introducing a sliding\nscale of university fees for overseas students in order to\nprotect those from the poorest\nbackgrounds. He added that this\nsystem would be introduced as\nsoon as the Labour Party were\nreturned to power and that the\nscale of fees would be a \"steeply\ndescending order of priority\".\nCentenary\nON JANUARY1, the Natural\nHistory Museum celebrated its\n100th Anniversary. The museum\nbegan due to an alliance struck\nup between Sir Richard Owen\nand Mr Gladstone in the earl v1860s. With Mr Gladstone' s strong support. Sir Richard Owen was able to get thc i museum on a firm footing by\n1885 with a vast array of modern\nanimal exhibits to a visitor's left\non entering, fossils and minerals\nto the right, and flora at the top.\nThe musuem is renowned for\nits massive collection of insects\nand in 1980 was named 'Museumof\nthe Year'. To celebrate its\ncentenary, the Museum is\npresently staging an exhibit entitled 'Nature stored, nature\nstudied' which shows the growth\nol the collection. In May, a major\npermanent exhibit will be\nopened on Darwin's 'Origin of\nthe Species'. It is perhaps ironical\nthat the Museum's chief founder,\nSir Richard Owen, was a major\nopponent of Darwin's views.\nFELIX, January 9,1981 Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Mooney shocked fI went rigid when I heard the news3 By our Special Correspondent\nA happy New Year was not had by Victor \"It tastes as good\ncoming up as It does coming down\" Mooney this year when he\nread In The Times of December 31 that his lifelong ambition, a knighthood had not been granted.\nThis came as a shock to Royal Arch Freemasonry circles,\nespecially as \"Sir\" Victor had recently stored up the best food for\nPrince Phillip's visit to stagger him with an eyeball rolling frenzy\nof delight resulting In the Press Secretary of the Duke of\nEdinburgh Award Scheme congratulating College on having\nsuch a \"superb caterer\".\nIt was evident at an early stage that Sir Victor expected such an\nhonour. When asked in FELIX on November 28 if he were not a cook\n\" what would you rather be?\", he said: \" Oh something like SIR Francis\nChichester\".\nThe honours list came as a shock to many IC students as well. Many of them have been eating Mooneys for several years now, comforting\nthemselves with the thought that, emaciated sick and undernourished\nas they were, their suffering was not in vain, and that by supporting\nthis truly great man in such a way they could at least feel proud when\nhe assumed his rightful title \u2014 \" Sir\" Victor. It has been suggested that\nall profits from refectories this year should go to the Conservative\nBoard of Finance( under the administration of Major General Wyldbore-Smith CB,D SO,O BE \u2014 the OBE costing as little as\n\u00a37,000, incidentally) in order to prevent the same thing happening\nnext year.\nw \u00a3 No se ha in toxic a don a die con\nesta ba zofia, Signor Mooney?\"\nWhen FELIX sent its ace poly glottal reporter, BB VVolffe, to find out\nhow the Breakfast Bar staff felt about their supremo not being honoured,\nhe asked \" tP or que no al quil an unco ci nero en lugar de un pinch e para\nhac cr lac omid a?\" only to r cci eve the inevitable re post\" Vaya us ted a escu pira o tra parte\". (It is thrilling to be under such a man.)\nVictor Mooney's catering career started on Joe's stall in the Mile End Road in 1948. He won fame as the Catering Chief at the Selsdon\nPark Hotel and later at the St James Court Hotel, before he moved to\nthe Grand Hotel (Harrogate). Shortly after coming to IC he won the\nGuild of Catering Managers Merit Award as Caterer of the Year in\n1957. Although IC's catering has degenerated into a disgusting state\nsince he came here, he has kept his reputation as a mild mannered\nbuffoon, always maintaining a strict \"dignified silence'' when criticised\nin the pages of FELIX. Nevertheless his kitchens, even though they\ncontravene Sections 12 to 37 of the Public Health Act \\9~T can\nproduce upside down cakes, chilli con carne with rice, sponge pudding\nwith raspberry jam, cucumber sandwiches, and even 1 H1. baked\nmince beef roo l; that are truly fit for the Monarchy. The was in which\nSir Victor has \"buttered-up\" [a culinary term] members ol the Ro\\al\nFamily; notably Prince Phillip the Greek (who receives the best food,\nwhilst students and the stall, who are charged VAT. pa> through the\nnose to sub sid is e people rich enough to pay at the check out and tat\nenough already to stuff themselves silly) should surely have been\nenough to tilt the balance in his favour.\nFELIX contacted Buckingham Palace to enquire if Prince Phillip\npaid VAT on his IC meals, as he is not a student, but no information\nwas available.\nThe reaction in College to the news ol Sir Victor's lack ol honours\nhas been varied: Ms Rae Snee, BSc, ARCS( a liver the pair\" sneered\nvindictively. \" Mooney? He's about as useful as a one-armed taxi\ndriver with crabs\".

    "content": "Amnesty International\nLast term the Imperial College Group staged a twenty-four hour sponsored fast in a successful\neffort to raise funds and publicise its aims; the\ngroup would like to thank all those who showed\ntheir support by contributing to our funds,\nsponsoring members and buying our Christmas\ncards and publications.\nThis term we are participating in the national\ncampaign organised by Amnesty concerning the\nuse of torture by security forces in Chile. Events\nin Chile have been highlighted in the British press\nwith the arrest and torture of Britons Claire Wilson\nin July last year, and Dr Sheila Cassidy in 1975.\nBut what is not generally known is that an\nestimated 1,500 Chileans have 'disappeared'\nbetween 1973 and 1977, and that many of these\nwill have been tortured in secret detention\ncentres. Hundreds of thousands have been\nforced into external exile following the coup of\n1973 and dissidents have been banished to\nremote parts of the country. By July 1980, the\nrepression was worse than at any previous time.\nHowever, the present British government has\ndiscounted human rights considerations when it\nannounced the renewal of diplomatic relations\nwith Chile last year, and the decision to allow the\nresumption of arms sales to that country.\nThe British Section of Amnesty is planning a major parliamentary initiative on Chile, which\nhopes ot pressure the government into revealing\ndetails of the arms trade with Chile, so that the\npublic can make its own judgement on the extent\nthat repression in Chile is supported by Britain.\nWe urge all concerned people to write to their\nMPs asking support for this move, and to sign the\npetition protesting against the use of torture,\nwhich is obtainable from R Sloss (Botany PG, int\n2096) to be presented to the Chilean am assad or in February.\nICCAG\nTHE START of a new year seems like a good time\nto remind you about ICCA G and its activities.\nICCA G stands for Imperial College Community\nAction Group, but, although it may sound\notherwise, we are neither a political nor a religious\ngroup. We are just a small College society whose\naim is to DO something to help some of those in\nneed in London. For example, every Tuesday and\nFriday night, a small group of us (not the same\nones all the time) travels in a minibus to Charing\nCross Bridge to give soup, bread and biscuits to\nthose sleeping rough there. On Saturdays a few of\nus help at a club for handicapped children and\ntheir friends, while others sometimes help to build\nan adventure playground. Some of us are hoping\nto go to the homes of old people and fit draught\nexclude rs and other insulation; others have\n\"adopted\" an old person to visit and do shopping\nfor. At Christmas, in collaboration with Dramsoc,\nwe arranged a concert in an old people's home,\nand the blood transfusion people come to College\ntwice a year at our request.\nWhy don't you think about coming along to one\nor more of our activities this term? Give us a try\n\u2014 you can get as little or as much involved as you\nlike. If you are interested, keep reading the\nICCA G articles in FELIX, or contact Sean Coyle,\nElec Eng 2.\nPhotosoc\nDURING THE next few weeks the Photographic\nSociety has two competitions and five lectures.\nThe first of these com petit on s 'The Black and\nWhite Competition' on Tuesday, January 13 will\nbe marked by a professional judge.
