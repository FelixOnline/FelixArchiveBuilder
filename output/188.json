We also disapprove of the\npersonal attacks on the President\nin the columns of Felix. Apart\nfrom his action at the Union\nMeeting we have confidence in\nhim as President of l.C. Union.\nYours faithfully,\nC.J. LIDDLE\n(President C& GU)\nB.L. OLDFIELD\n(President RSMU)\nM. HARRIS\n(President RCSU)\nIOM MENT Dear Sir,\nThe Excutive and Council have\npointed out to me that the two\nreasons I had for justifying my\naction at the last Union Meeting\n\u2014namely\u2014(a) precedent and (b) assent, are not valid. The precedent was a bad one and in fact, I did not have the consent of the\nUnion Meeting.\nHaving considered this, I now\nbelieve that I made a mistake in\nacting as I did at the last Union\nMeeting; I therefore express my\napologies to the Union.\nYours faithfully,\nASIT CHANDMAL,\nPresident, I.C. Union.\nWhile few of ue wish to know the future, many hope reasonably \u2014to have a hand in shaping It; and th le requires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But\ntraditional methods of probing the future are no longer\nin favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.\nWitches are prophets only of ultimate doom. So today\none turns, In the first instance, to the appointments\nofficer for the pathways to the future. We, for\nour part, would like to elaborate what lies along\none of them\u2014Unilever Research.\nResearch In .Unilever means industrial research:\nresearch directed to specific ends: research with a practical outcome. But not only that. No Industrial\nproject or problem stands In Isolation. Its roots rarely\nlie In Industry. So, research In Unilever also means\nresearch in a number of contrasting fields\u2014detergents,\nedible fats, foods, cosmetics\u2014and it means, further,\nresearch In surface chemistry, gly cer l de chemistry,\nprotein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental\ntopics. It means a community of scientific Interest within\nUnilever, and continuity of academic contact outside It.\nIt can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction\nto the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.\nIt can provide satisfaction in the pursuit of it and\nfinancial reward in the success of it. There is only one\nminor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.\nWe Invite you to mite to Dr. A. CROSSLEY, Staff Officer,\nResearch Dlv., Unilever Ltd., Unilever House, London, E.C.4 UNILEVER RESEARCH \u00a3et te t6fa the Editm\nDear Sir,\nI was most surprised and disturbed on reading two articles in\nthe last issue of Felix.\nThe news item by J. M. Combes on the NUS debate had\nmany inaccurate and misleading\nstatements in it, giving the whole\narticle a strongly biased view towards the side of those who are\nnot in favour of IC joining NUS.\nWhile I don't much mind biased\nviews being- expressed in the edi-tori al,I do feel that you, as edi-tor, should ensure that reports of\nevents should be truthful and free\nfrom all bias.\nAs for Martin Stacey's article\n\" J 'accuse,\" I wish I had his\nability to say \" it is a fine thing to\nbe honest, but it is also important\nto be right\" (quoting Churchill)\none minute, and then write such\na deceitful and vicious personal\nattack on the President of the\nUnion in the next. Even if Mr.\nChandmal's\" outburst \" was un-precedent ed, which it was not,\nthere was no reason for you to\npublish such an article which\ncould have done immense damage\nto Mr. Chandmal's reputation\namong those not present at the\nlast few minutes of the Union\nMeeting to hear what really did\nhappen.\nYours sincerely,\nDAVE WILCOX,\nPhysics III.\nP.S. \u2014/ would appreciate if you\nwould not publish any part of this\nletter without publishing the\nwhole. I would also like a reply\non the points I have raised about\nallowing these articles to go into\nprint, if possible to reach me by\nSaturday, \\6th( Union rack).\nIt is hard to answer charges\nof inaccuracies unless these\nare more specific. In any cta se the Editor does not enter into\nprivate correspondence about\narticles published in FELIX\nDear Sir\nI was one of the few who recorded their abstentions in the\nvote at the recent NUS Debate.\nI must confess, from my position\nof neutrality, that I was mildly\nsurprised When the President\nasked the Union's consent to his\nspeaking. I was again mildly surprised when no one raised an ob-j ect ion. Faced with the vehemence\nand decisiveness of his speech, I was stunned.\nJudging from the charges of\nduplicity that have been hurled at\nthe President, it is evident that the\nopposition to NUS thought that\nhe was on their side. True, they\ndid not object at the time. If\nthen the opposition were prepared\nto let him speak, thinking that he\nwas on their side, their subsequent criticism of his action has\nno justification.\nThe President defends his\naction on the grounds that it had\nample precedent, and that no objections were raised at the time.\nThat there is precedence for an\naction does not necessarily mean\nthat such an action is desirable.\nIf it has not been noted before let\nit be noted now that such, action\nis distasteful to IC Union. True,\nthere were no objections at the\ntime, for, when surprised, the\nhum a a. being needs time to think\nReasonable beings seem to be\nagreed that on the fact that NUS\nis a cause worthy of support.\nWhat is in question is whether IC\ncan afford to join without losing\nsome of its excellent and valuable\nfacilities. I personally got the\nimpression that the Rector, or the\nauthorities, would be willing to\nprovide us with the money, or\nmuch of it, should we decide to\njoin NUS. But how is one to\nknow ? Council, who might\nhave the answer, are divided.\nThat the division is not into two\nequal groups is no help to me, as\nI place more weight, per person,\non the judgment of the individuals\nin the minority group.\nYours neutrally,\nJEYAN ANKETELL,\nDepartment of Physics.\nDear Sir,\nMr. Stacey, in your last issue,\ndescribed the voting system in the\nrecent NUS meeting as \" a voting\nsystem so devised as to permit\nhalf the people to decide after\nhearing only half the debate ! \"\nHe might have added that some\npeople voted without hearing any\nof the debate; even the hall of\nthe RGS was too small to allow\nall those who wanted admittance\nto actually get in. These were,\nhowever, allowed to vote, and\nquite rightly. This was despite\nthe fact that less than one-third\nof the Union members voted any-way. Under these circumstances,\ncan any decision ever be described is democratic, and representing the majority opinion of\nthe Union ?\nIt is not good enough to blame\nthis 28 per cent, poll on the\napathy among Union members.\nUnion debates, unfortunately, are\noften an utter waste of time and\nmost Ijnion members just do not\nhave the time to waste. I left the\nNUS debate at 2.45 after hearing\ntwo good speeches and a lot of\nrubbish\u2014and neither of the good\nspeeches made any new points to\nme. When this issue is next\nraised, I shall go along, register\nmy vote, and leave.\nThis prompts me to ask why a referendum cannot be held to\nsettle this matter once and for all.\nVoting slips could easily be distributed by the departmental reps.\nBallot boxes on the concourse\nareas of all the College buildings\nQUOTES OF THE WEEK.\" I 've been sent down by the\nRector...\" \u2014 The Domestic Bursar.\n\n"

The Chairman of\nthe RCA, Mr. Haclin, protested\nvehemently about the financial\nsituation of the RC C and contrasted his austerity measures\nwith this apparent extravagance\nof the ACC. Mr. Phillips (what\nwould Council be without him ?\none wonders) surmounted the obstacle of the sympathy aroused\nby Mr. Haclin retaliating : \" This\nis a Good Thing.\" Officials of\nACC clubs would be able to meet\nthe many staff members who take\nan active interest in sport in the\nCollege. Eventually the Phillips'\npatent stubborn rear guard action\nresulted in an exasperated Council passing on to the next bus i ness.\nThe Executive report revealed\nthat Messrs. Finch and Pearson\nhad together approached the\nRector about obtaining additional finances for our proposed\naffiliation to NUS. The Rector\nstipulated that they be accompanied by the President. Nonetheless, their attempt to bypass the\nExecuive was condemned\nstrongly by Council.\nVarious reports were then submitted to Council stating that\nplans for the Sports Centre are\nprogressing slowly ; Felix is losing money due to falling sales ;\nPhoenix sold 900 copies, losing\n\u00a350 which, it is hoped, will be\npartly or wholly recovered by the\nsecond issue; the Square and\nFolk Dancing Group is now a fully-Hedged Club ; conditions at\nSilwood continue to be hopelessly\ninadequate \u2014 especially when\nvisited by Touchstone parties;\nthe Bookstall needs room to expand and several schemes are\nunder discussion.\nA career\nis what it's worth\nIf you divide the population into two groups \u2014 those\nwho take THE TIMES and those who don't \u2014you find\nthis: those who don't take THE TIMES are in the great\nmajority. Those who do are either at the top in their\ncareers, or are confidently headed there.\nTHE TIMES both by its seniority in experience and\nby its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,\nnaturally commends itself to successful people. There\nis no high level conference, no board meeting, no top\nexecutive's private office into which THE TIMES is\nnot apt to be taken.\nThis choice of a newspaper by people who get on is\nindisputable.* In which of the two groups do you\nplace yourself?\nRead THE TIMES\n* STUDENTS AND THE TIMES: As a student\nyou can have The Times for 2jd. Write for details to\nthe Circulation Manager, The Times, London, E.C.4 After a few more reports\nCouncil moved on to A. O.B. \u2014\nforty people wish to form a Flat\nEarth Society, whose aims are to\n\" SEEK THE TRUTH.\" explained Mr. Harris. This Society\nwould be for people who know\n\" what's what.\" However, the\naims of the Society had not been\npublished on the Union Notice\nBoard so Council could do nothing about it at that time. This\ndid not prevent Mr. Pearson from\nexclaiming joyfully that the proposed society would probably\ncome under the SCC.\nA petition, bearing over 200\nsignatures had been received calling on Council to convene an\nExtraordinary General Meeting\nto reconsider the decision of the\nlast Union Meeting concerning\nNUS. The petition expressed dissatisfaction with the conduct of\nthe meeting and raised doubts as\nto the validity of the marginal\nmajority.\nThe President then justified his\naction in speaking at the end of\nthe meeting for the notorious 45\nseconds. Council Members\nvented their feelings with varying\ndegrees of acerbity. \" Your\ncrimes, Mr. President, are two-fold,\" declared Mr. Gardiner\nsternly. \" No excuse,\" said Mr.\nOldfield. Mr. White was\n\" shocked and surprised.\" Mr.\nPhillips declared that it was \" dis-graceful.\" Mr. Austin thought it\n\" deplorable.\" Mr. Pearson believed that Council's grapes were\na little sour. The diatribe con-tin u ed, while the President clung\nfirmly to his justification of\nAssent and Precedent ; when it\ncame to the point, Council declined to censure him for his\naction.\nInevitably tension gave way to\nanticlimax. Mr. Jenkins chewed\na large bone of discontent, asserting that the voting system used\nlast time was farcical, and urged\nCouncil to find a fairer method.\nSome suggested a referendum,\nwhile others considered that the\nmeeting should take the form of\na debate ; even compromise was\nmentioned. Eventually y the Executive was left to decide the relevant date, location, voting s ys tem, everything else and . . . so\nto bar.\nBRYAN HOOPER.\nTHE PIRATES OF PENZANCE Reviewed by D. Farrell.\nThe Musical Society in cooperation with the Dramatic\nSociety gave 'Pirates of Penzance' as their annual Gilbert\nand Sullivan offering last week.\n'The Pirates' is perhaps not\nthe best thing that that curious\npair threw together, and the\nplot and score do not stand\ntoo close a scrutiny, but there\nare many things in it which\ncombined to produce an enjoyable evening last week-One of the delights of\ntheatre going is to see pretty\ngirls doing graceful things instead of the plain trivia of\neveryday life General Stanley's numerous daughters bear so\nlittle relation to the plot that\nthis must be ther ra isom d'e tre, land they filled the bill ad mir ably. Indeed, I would have\nbeen more than content if Gilbert had thrown in a scene\ndevoted to a static appraisal\nof their charms.\nWith a natural generosity of\nthought and action, William\nJames gave us a really splendid Pirate King. This part\ndemands a fine strong voice\nwith a commanding presence\nand a strong comic sense. Bill,\nof home grown IC stock, has\nthe lot, and knows how to use\nthem.\nThe orchestra were pretty\nsolid, with some very good\npla ving from flutes and cellos.\nThis was a production well\nup to the annual standard\nwhich fully deserved the good\nsized audiences it drew.\n\n"

The term\n'Senior Warden' has sinister connotations and it is unfortunate\nthat many students first encounter him in his role of dix ipl in arian when the 'business of the day' is hardly conducive to an\namicable relationship. His responsibilities however, embrace\nfar wider horizons than the keeping of the peace. He sits on\nall line Committees concerned with student welfare, being chairman of the Refectory Committee, and the Athletic Committee,\nand vice-chairman of the Halls of Residence Committee, acting\nas a 'puller together' of these various bodies. The non resident\nstudents are his particular rep on sibi lit y, and it is his job to\nsee that the facilities provided by the expanding College cater\nfor their need as well as for the more fortunate, residents.\n'Steve' was educated at King\nEdward VI school in Norwich,\nand St. Catherine's Cambridge, wh s fe he read Geography and Surveying. A ke~n \u2022 por is man, he played hockey\nfor his College, and was a row in i enthusiast. He also\nn'ave d hockey fT IC when he\nfirst came to take up the: po^t of Assistant Lecturer in 1937,\nand has been the President of\nparty of six camp;\nng on the ice\nLAMLEY9\n\u00ae\nTECHNICAL & GENERAL\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWING INSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\nt.3&5 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7.I CHC since 1939. For several\nv ears now, he rr\u00bbs been Secretfairy of the Athletic Ground\nCommittee, which runs Harlington.\nAs a boy, Sf\neve was a keen\nmember of the Scouting move-ment, and loved camping.\nThese were the pursuits which\ngave him the initial inspiration for a life interest in\nexploration and adventure; he\nhas taken part in several ex-p editions, mostly to polar\nregions, first in 1930 cn coming down from Cambridge,\nand most recently in 1960\nwhen he accompanied Sir\nVivian Fuchs to the Antartic\nA founder member of the IC\nExploration Board in 1957, he\nis now the Boards chairman-The three major expeditions in\nwhich he took part before\ncoming to IC were to Greenland. North West Canada, and\nBit ish Grahfam Land in Anta rtica, his main functions on\nthese trips being fur ve ving and climatology: he has ba\nen\nawarded the Polar Medal with\nboth Artie and Antartic\nclasps. In 1936, he was in\noff Graham Land when this\nbroke up during a storm. The\nparty managed to reach the\nshelter of a rocky islet, but\nwere there for two weeks be*\nfer e they managed to return to\nbase \"120 mph <gales can be\nquite terrifying in the Antartic.\" On his last trip South, his\nship, the Kista Dan was trapped in the ice for a fortnight,\nwith a ten degree list, while of\nthe more satisfying experiences 'sledging up and down\nvalleys behind a really good\nteam of dogs is tremendous\nfun and very ex hi li rating.' During the war, he served\nwith this RAF and was CO. of\nan air survey Interpretation!\nUnit. In 1946, he was awarded\nthe OBE( Miliary). The following year, he was appointed\nUniversity Reader in-Survey-ing at IC. Since the war, he\nhas been several times to\nCanada and once to Thailand\nto help in Air Surveys.\nAs Senior Warden, Steve\nreceives all the complaints\nabout student behaviour outside the College, from the\nproceedings at Marlborough\nStreet to dust-bin rolling in\nEnnismore Mews. There are\nexamples of student ragging,\nsuch as the Spanner on the\nwall of Physics which he unofficially applauds- Events\nsuch as Morphy Day and\nGuilds Field Cup Race are\nfine opportunities for good\n\"sport'. However, these mob\noutings usually get out of hand\ndue to the thoughtless behaviour of soma students who\noften do considerable damage\nand cause excessive inconvenience to other people. Better\ni and more responsible organisation is called for on these\noccasions. He deplores the inconsiderate behaviour of many\nstudents and the attitude that\n'doing damage is O.K. as long\nas it is paid for'. Money cannot repair the reputation of\nthe College. Steve is also concerned with the bad behaviour\nof some College teams on\naway fixtures, and other parties on works visits etc. Trophy\ncollecting can sometimes be\namusing but more often than\nnot, the 'stealing' of signs and\nother sundry ornaments is a stupid and costly affair.\nThe delays on South Side\nare as infuriating to him as\nthey are to the students- He\nlooks forward to the expansion of the Halls of Residence\nand other student amend tie's. Imperial College Hostels have\nalways been run with the\nminimum of restrictions on\nthe residents. He hopes that it\nwill not be neccessary to impose restrictive rules in the\nnew Halls, but it is up to the\ninmates to behave themselves.\nA large student community in\nthe centre of a residential area\nmust observe the accepted\ncodes of behaviour.\nHe is very much in favour\nof the first degree course being\nextended to four years to enable the undergraduates to\ntake part in non-academic\nactivities. The College is very\nfortunate to have a large\nnumber of postgraduates taking an active part in the Union\nand their influence is extremely valuable in the well administered Union. He is confident\nthat the Union will be able to\ncope with the additional\nadministration of South Side\nfacilities.\nSteve has considerable experience of understanding and\n'dealing' with young people\ngained on his many expeditions and from bringing up his\ntwo Children who are now of\nUniversity age. He is a quiet\nman who speaks deliberately,\nconsidering each point care-fully, never making rash\npromises or attempting to\ndisguise his true opinion with\nfalse sincerity. He is putting in\na tremendous amount of work\nto make the new IC a place\nwhere students will be educated to be more than just back\nroom scientists. Let w hope\nthat his efforts will not be in\nvain.\nD. HP. "

Do not\nlet this slip.\n2) Bible reading weekly if not\ndaily- The Gospel for the com-in ci Sunday in the New Eng.\nBible is a good idea.\n3) Regular attendance at the\naltar each Snndav. Tt is' a grave sin to fail to be present\nat the altar each Sundav,\nexcept under very serious circumstances.4) 'Loyalty to the life and\nwitness of the church in &i< \u00b0.\ncollege. Personal fads and\nfancies don't count here.\n5) Some regular practice of\nself-denial. Doing without a meal or smoking or drinking\non Wed. and Fri. is good.\n6) Almsgiving. The money\nfrom your self denial\u2014and\nthis ought not to be less than\n5 shillings a week\u2014ought to\ngo towards the church. This\nshould be extra to, not instead\nof your regular Sunday offer-ing-7) An honest attempt each\nweek, to talk to some non-church goer about our Holy\nFaith, and to pray for, and\nbring that person to chur cn with you.\nFather Ivor\n\n"

C.B.C VISIT LEANDER\nCLUB\nThe Boat Club paid its annual\nvisit to Leander Club, the home\nof British rowing, over the weekend of the 9th10 th February.\nThis \"Henley\" weekend has\nnow come to be recognised as a vital stage in the, winter training\nprogramme and this year in par-ti cula r, the first, second and third\nVIIIs benefitted considerably\nfrom the intensive coaching and\ntraining, and from the inter-crew\nrivalry.\nAn assorted collection of old\ncrocks left the College on Friday\nlunchtime, and\\ by 5.0 p.m. the\ncrews had completed seven miles\nof preliminary paddling over the\nrelatively slow stream of the\nHenley reach.\nAfter an excellent dinner and\nan early night, the crews were on\nthe water by 8.00 a.m. for a pre-breakfast tune-up, and then again\nat 11.0 for the main work of the\nday. At this stage, the emphasis is put on long distance work\nat average ratings, and all three\ncrews took advantage of the three\nmile course to improve stamina\nand technique in this manner. In\nthe summer term, the outings\ntend to become shorter, with the\naccent on higher ratings rather\nthan on mileage.\nDuring the afternoon, the Oxford Varsity boat was practising\non the same water, and several\ncorrespondents were seen taking\nnote of the pre-seasonal form of\nthe IC eights. On the Sunday,\nthe river was again awakened\nbefore breakfast, and before the\nday was th rou eh each crew had\nadded a further twenty miles to\nits log book.\nBefore departing from what\never v one agreed had been an\nexcellent weekend, the little excess\nenergy that remained was used\nFELIX ANSWER TO THE\nPPA.\nNot to be outdone by the\nPPA's decision to forecast results,\nFelix's sports experts have turned\ntheir gaze to some possible fix-ture s, and came up with some\nunanimous decisions (it should\nperhaps be explained that to prevent controversy among the\npanel of experts, their number\nwas fixed at ONE). Apart from\nthe standard result for most\ngames of \" IC lose to CEM,\" we\nhave the following :\nChandmallions 0, Sherwood\nForesters 8.\nFinchfield Rangers 2, NUS\nUnited 1.\nHarris Casuals 0, ICWA Dynamoes 1.'\nLiddlehampton 2, Spudfield\nMiners 6.\n(abandoned after 89 mins.)\nPreecetown 3, Stacey Albion 3.\nWhite City 0, Old Tyeonians 0.\nfor a snowball fight, and, need it\nbe said, chucking King in the\ndrink.\nThe first major event of the\nyear\u2014the U.L. Head\u2014has almost\narrived. The first eight look certain to retain the Dixon Bowl for\nthe fastest College crew over the\nmile course. I.C. will be entering all 9 crews for this event in\ncomparison to the one or two\nboats entered by other colleges.\nOn the 16th March, four crews\nwill be entered for the Reading\nHead. This race is an organisational masterpiece in which two-hundred crews have to be herded\ntogether before the race can even\nstart.\nOn the 23rd March all I.C. crews will be rowing in the mammoth Putney Head. Practically\nevery club in the country is represented, and over three hundred\ncrews race over the reverse Boat\nRace course. The club is hoping\nfor very encouraging results, and\nin particular the promising\nnovice crews should be able to\ngain about fifty places from\ntheir contemporaries of 1962.\nGERALD W. PRITCHARD\n(Boat Club Press Agent).\nSwimming\nClub\nOn Friday, February 15th the IC Swimming Club received as their vistors Cambridge University Tadpoles\none of the most attractive fixtures of the season. With the\nweakened team, IC did well\nto hold Tadpoles to a narrow\n33 - 27 win in the Swimming\nmatch. Once again, the College duo of Hennesy and Collins showed their superiority\nn the back-stroke event, gain*\ning maximum points as they\nhave done consistently this\nyear.\nIn the Water Polo match,\neven without two members of\nthe regular team, IC were generally superior, winning by a comfortable 5-1. This extended their unbeaten run to four\ngames in eight days. Although\nno individual player was out-tan ding, the standard of team-work, which has been poor in\nrecent weeks, was back to it's usual form.\nIf this can be maintained,\nthe team should again finish\nin a prominent position in\nDivision I of the University\nLeague, and end the season\non a high note.\nCross Country\nBy the time this is in print,\nthe Hyde Park Relay will have\ntaken place. Considering that\nmost of the Universities take part,\nI.C. did well to win the event\nlast season. However, only three\nof the triumphant team remain\nat college and on top of that injuries and illness have hampered\nseveral of the club's top runners;\nTed Wilkins and Pete Roy, in\nparticular. Consequently, a new\nwinner this year is to be expected.\nApart from two cancellations,\nfixtures have continued despite\nthe weather. Last term's programme ended with the UL U Champs in which I.C. came out\n3rd in the team placing.\nFor the most part the courses\nthis term have either been\ncovered in snow or frozen up.\nThis has not made for easy running or fast times. Although two\nor more teams often turn out on\none afternoon, there is still a lack\nof first-rate runners. The result\nis matches lost to Sandhurst,\nLeeds, Met. Police, and RAF Halton. Those matches won include Goldsmiths and Reading\n(Home and Away).\nPersonal performances have\nvaried considerably. When free\nfrom injury, Ted Wilkins continues as the club's leading run-ner. Together with Jo Fitzsimmons, the skipper \" Link \" is\ngoing well on the roads. Chris\nJances seems to thrive on anything from plough to marshes,\nwhile over a fast course Howerd\nDickson and Frank Hobson perform creditably.\nThe position in League I is\nparticularly interesting as I. C.1st are fourth, on lv80 points behind\nKina's on a tally of over 1,000. It\nmia ht be noted that amid the\nconfusion at the S.W. E.T.C. meeting, Chris James knew the\ncorrect course, stuck to it, and\nearned himself a silver pot even\nthough the race was declared\nvoid.\nGolf\nA practice net has been erected in one of the fives\ncourts opposite Week's Hall,\nPrinces Gardens. It will be\navailable to all members of\nthe College and it is hoped to\nhave professional tuition\nclasses on Tuesdays and\nThurdays at lunchtime. Clubs\nand balls for these will be\nmade available.\nAnyone interested in either\ntuition or private use of the\nnet should put his name on the\nGolf Association noticeboard\nat the bottom of the stairs near\nIthe Union bar.\nGliding Club\nEXPLORATION WEEK The record of the Imperial\nCollege Exploration Society\nrou st be just about supreme\namong University Exploring\ngroups for the number and\ndiversity of the expeditions it\nhas supported\u2014fifteen in the\nlast three years. Although this\nis no doubt due in large\nmeasure to the encouragement\nand support (not only financial)\nof the College through the\nExploration Board, this should\nin no way be allowed to\ndetract from the sucess of the\nSociety.\nLast week, the Society held\nart exhibition in the Upper\nLounge of the Union to show\nto members of the Union some\nof the results of its efforts.\nThere were bugs from i he West\nIndies, skins and rugs from\nEthiopia, and amphora from\nbeneath the Mediterranean,\nand photos from all parts of\nthe globe. North to Spitzbergen, south to Antartica,\n(though I did not know of an\nexpedition to this part of the\nworld) west to St. Kitts and\neast to Kashmir. Despite the\nwide variety of the expeditions, it was disappointing to\nsee that two thirds of the\nexhibition were occupied by\nunderwater swimming and\nart ic exploration. Perhaps this\nwas due to a lack of exhibits\nfrom Kashmir, Ghana, Iceland, etc.. as the members of\nthese expeditions have now\nmostly left College.\nThe exhibition appeared to\nhave been designed to show to\nmembers of the College (and\nto representatives of various\nbenefactors) what had been\nattempted and achieved by the\nlast expeditions. Thus we saw\nbotanical specimens, zoological\ncollections, maps, papers etc.\nproduced by the expeditions in\naddition to the fine collection\nof photographs.\nTo an ex-member of an\nexpedition, it was a disappointment that there was so little\nof the results of previous\nexperience\u2014especially in the\nway of food and eq u'p ment that had been tried and tested\nin the field. A good opportunity was lost here to give the\nmembers of this year's expeditions mu oh useful knowledge,\neven though most of it can\nbe obtained through the Society by other means.\nG.J.

    "content": "FELIX During the week February 3rd to 10th, Father Bernard, a Franciscan friar, and his team of Campaigners, have been living in this and\nother neighbouring colleges. Their presence has certainly not gone by\nunnoticed, for it was not only their unusual attire which was so\nrefreshingly different, but their whole attitude and outlook upon\nlife ! They set a stimulating example to everyone who was in the\nleast bit interested. The Campaign programme was so extensive\nthat I cannot go into it in great detail, but I hope that this short\narticle will at least plot the greatest peaks on its graph of achieve-ment.\nI doubt if anyone who attended\nFather Dennis' Tuesday General\nStudies Lecture \" On Being a Christian To-day \" will forget it\nvery quickly ; not for what was\nsaid on matters of belief, but for\nthe overriding impression of sincere liberalism and sympathetic\nunderstanding of the modern\nworld. Later, one curious sce pti c told me that he had gone to the\nlecture expecting to find a rampant fanatic. What he did in\nfact find was a man he could ad-mire. The greatest onus was\nbrilliantly borne by the leader,\nFather Bernard, who on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday\nevenings spoke on \" The Faith \"\nto about 150 who filled the Snack\nBar where the talks were given.\nDealing with human and spiritual\nrelationships, with the life of\nChrist, the meaning of the\nChurch and Christian disciple-ship ; he seemed to be confronting many men and women of\nwidely varying requirements with\nthe impossible. In the opinion\nof those who heard him, he\nsounded convincingly true. The\nsecond General Studies lecture,\nwhich was given by Father Hugh\non Thursday, was not very well\nattended since it clashed with\nthe NUS Debate. The audience\nof 30 or so who did attend heard\na very penetrating treatment of\nthe subject of Prayer.\nOn the Thursday evening five\nmen from Imperial College were\npresented to the Bishop for the\nSacraments of Confirmation and\nFirst Communion. This service\ntook place in the University\nChaplaincy Church for students\nin West London\u2014-St. Augustine's Church in Queen's Gate. A large\ncongregation of students were\npresent at this moving service to\nstrengthen and encourage the\nfive men who had thus committed\nthemselves to the Faith of the\nGospel and to a lifetime of\nChristian disciple ship. After the\nservice a party took place in the\nUnion Snack Bar, where beer,\ncider and conversation flowed\nfreely. (Not necessarily in that\norder !)\nMORPHY DAY 1962\nSEE YOURSELF\u2014CANDID CAMERA WORK Editor\u2014Chris Hussell\nCameras\u2014Roger Hanson, Dave Ewins, Chris Hussell,\nWarwick Faville\nSound\u2014David Bishop, with much assistance from Dr. T.L. Thomas.\n\" Morphy Day \" said the posters, in suitably embellished letters,\nnot revealing if this were to be a tribunal, a slide show (with or without Closed Circuit TV) or whatever. It turned out to be an 8 mm.\nmovie with synchronise d tape sound track, of the Morphy Day celebrations last term.\nWhen passing comment on a production such as this, one must\nbear in mind the envisaged audi-en ce, the conditions under which\nthe film was made, and equipment used. The film was oo-vio us ly made with IC students in\nmind, people who know why\nthere is a clash of opinions on the\ntowpath, and who know what the\nboats are doing on the river.\nThese students will have already\nbeen to the event are thus\nsimply wishing to see themselves,\nor have missed the whole thing\nand now want to see why. If, as\nis possible, the film is shown to\nFreshmen, a more detailed explanation will be necessary, in the\nform, perhaps, of an improved\nsound track.\nThe film started un heralded after a few hitches with the synchronising equipment, then ran\nsmoothly for the rest of the show.\nIt was one of those \" See half\nthe plot before the titles \" epics\nwith rather hilarious (?) opening\nsequences designed to tickle one's humorous. These pre-filled items\nshowing training on the river, and\nthe antics of the camera crew of\nfour. The \" Maigret\" style titles\nwere followed by the truth about\nMorphy Day, containing some\nexcellent shots\u2014the pre-briefing\nof the combatants, the hospitality\nof London Transport, the patience of Job (a bus driver at a zebra crossing), the battle on the\ntowpath, and even some rowing.\nThe film finished with various encounters with the general public.\nWhat of the technical quality ?\nThe editing, which appears to\nhave been done with \" Quicksplice,\" was well handled, considering that the material was\nshot un scripted, under battle conditions and often in a very poor\nlight. Some continuity was\nachieved, but only for those who\nknew the sequence of events any-way, and who could tell an RCS\nman by the colour of his under-wear. The rowing sequences did\nnot make it clear which were the\nraces/re-rows/practice runs/other\neights/Oxford and or Cambridge.\nThe film tended to take the form\nof a punch-up on the towpath\nwith cutaway s to the river and\nrowing, and vice-versa.\nThe one or two stage sequences\nadded interest, especially when\nthey concluded, as did the balloon one with the artistic passing\ncomment to the camera, which\nthe most inexperienced lip reader\ncould understand. The College\nPresidents also appeared (and\ntheir vices) searching for that\nelusive something in their hair.\nThe sound synchronisation\nseemed to be excellent, so perhaps a more ambitious sound\ntrack with more spot effects could\nhave been tried. Some of the\nrapid changes, in background\nmusic were a little abrupt, though\nthe first fifteen minutes were good\nsound wise, the picture content\nmatching the mood-music. The\nlast fifteen minutes, the backing\nwas adequate\u2014even inspired at\none or two instances.\nConsidering that the film, with\nsound, was on a budget of \u00a310,\nit was a right excellent pro duc tion. Comparing it with the last\n8 mm. effort, \" 1961 Carnival\nWeek,\" which ran mute, there\nappears to be sufficient improvement to justify the expense of\nthe 16 mm. sound on film, taken\nover 18 months, of life at Imperial College, which is being\nplanned at the present moment.\n\"Morphy Day, 1963,\" was a success. The audiences certainly\nthought so.\nOn Saturday yet another friar,\nFather Oswald conducted a Quiet\nDay in St. Augustine's Church to\nassist men and women who had\nbelieved themselves called to do\nsomething definite about themselves and their way of Christian\ndisciple ship. This was attended\nby about 50 people.\nQuite the most important times\nduring the Campaign were the innumerable Coffee Parties\u2014some\nof them going on until the early\nhours of the morning, with Friars\nand all!\u2014-where the very excellent members of the Team of\nCampaigners were able to meet a large number of students, and\noften to communicate to them in\na most un self conscious and movingly genuine manner something\nof the very deep and abiding\nmeaning of the great Truths concerning God, Christ and His\nChurch.\nThose of us who were privileged to share in TWTWTW are\nprofoundly grateful and most\nparticularly to the members of\nthe Team.\nDAVID HOYLE.\nChem.
