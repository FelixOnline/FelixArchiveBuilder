    "content": "W\nell, this article has\nbeen a long time in\nproduction, and I\u2019m\nsurprised that this\nhasn\u2019t been highlighted in a letter yet. I suppose that I\u2019m\njust one of the few people left who\ncare about such things.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this article?\u201d\nI hear you all cry, or I imagine you\ndo. Shout it a little louder, and I may\njust explain. Are you sitting comfort-ably? Then we\u2019ll begin.\nThe week before last, I was reading through my usual copy of Felix\n(1334), armed with my usual red\npen. I\u2019ve got into the habit of trawling through our dearly beloved\npaper, picking out the various little\nthings that the editor has missed\nin his rush to write half the articles\nand publish it. Then, to my horror,\nI arrived at the Nightlife section. It\nwas at that point that I very nearly\ngave up on the the use of the English\nlanguage, the world in general, and\neditors in particular.\nI\u2019ll ask a question here, and I hope\nthat not too many of you get it wrong.\nHere goes: how do you spell \u201cbeer\u201d?\nIf you answered B-E-A-R (twice),\nthen you should be very ashamed\nof yourself. Beer is pretty much the\nsingle most important word in the\nstudent vocabulary. On the other\nhand, people might have started giving out teddy bears for a quick flash\nof one\u2019s breasts \u2013 if so, nobody told\nme about it. If you make this sort\nof mistake, you certainly should not\nbe editing a section in the student\npaper (or working in Hamley\u2019s, for\nthat matter).\nPoor spelling aside, some of\nthe paragraphs barely make any\nsense at all. Has anyone writing\nfor Felix heard of sentence con-struction, proofreading, or common\nsense? Judging from some articles,\nthe answer is a resounding \u201cno\u201d. If\nthis is the standard of spelling and\ngrammar of the editors, how much\ndamage is done to the articles that\nthey edit? This isn\u2019t a rant against\nWhat really grinds my gears\nHow can\ninforming the\nstudents of the\ndress code be\ndeemed \u201can\noverreaction\u201d,\nwhen the\nmatter has\ncaused a\nnational stir?\n\u201c\nPeter Gri\ufb03n\nfelix\nSir Richard & Dress\nCode\nHow can informing the students of\na ridiculous dress code be deemed\n\u201can overreaction\u201d, when the matter\nhas caused such a stir as to make\nit into several national newspapers\nincluding yesterday\u2019s Guardian\nand BBC news.\nIf this a matter for \u201cmature\ndebate\u201d why weren\u2019t, we, the students consulted for such a debate\nbefore the policy was put in place?\nCollege seem to believe they can\ngo around making autocratic decision without so much as a by-your-leave to the students. The students,\nand more importantly, the Union\nNo 1336\nThursday\n24 November 2005\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nfelix\nThursday 24 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\u201d\nRupert, as he does have a lot to do,\nand there\u2019s hardly anybody writing\nfor Felix. Writing most of the stories\nand editing the whole newspaper\nis a lot for one person to manage,\nand it shouldn\u2019t just be one person\ndoing this. An editor\u2019s job is, sur-prisingly, to edit. Felix represents\nthe student population at Imperial.\nIf Felix is anything to go by, then\nwe\u2019re almost illiterate, barely able\nto string together a coherent para-graph, and only one or two people\ndo all the work.\nI have no time or space to mention\nall of the numerous errors that they\nmust have fought tooth and nail to\nforce past computer spell-checkers.\nI know Felix has at least one copy\neditor (one of my housemates), and\nhe does well when he has the time. It\ntakes too much time to fix all of the\nstupid mistakes that people make in\ntheir articles, and it shouldn\u2019t have\nto be that way, even if they are written at 3am.\nWhy are people not taught how\nto spell and punctuate any more?\nWe\u2019re no longer taught the rules\nof grammar at school. Let me give\nyou an example to illustrate how\nbad things are (putting Felix aside\nfor the moment). My girlfriend is at\nRoyal Holloway, and is a first-year\nEnglish student. Part of the work\nshe was given last week was an\nexercise in putting apostrophes in\nthe correct place and identifying all\nof the verbs, nouns, adjectives and\nadverbs in an extract from a book.\nThis is not what either of us expected from a degree-level course: it\u2019s\nmore suited to 7-year-olds learning\nhow to write our language.\nReading through old editions of\nFelix on the website gave me an\ninsight into the past. Felix used to be\nfunny. It used to have great writers\nand was well-respected by the stu-dents. The writers used to be able\nto spell. Please, let\u2019s try to return to\nthat golden age once more.\nPerhaps next week, a lesson in\nbasic English.\nLiked it or loathed it?\nSend your opinions to comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nneed to make our views heard.\nIts is encouraging to see that\nstudents are taking action in\nthese matters, there have been\ntwo protests in as many weeks,\nagainst the dress code and noisy\nBioengineering lecturers.\nElections Farce\nWill Union elections ever proceed\nwithout hold-ups and bickering?\nFelix can\u2019t remember a time when\nICU elections passed without\nincident. Spam emailing seems to\ncause problems just about every\ntime they hold elections, shouldn\u2019t\nthe Union just ban candidates from\ncampaigning via email altogether?\nAt least the Union isn\u2019t fining students for grafting the streets with\nchalk.\nNew \u2018Southside\u2019 bar\nThe students loved Southside\nbar and were very sad to see it\nlost, lets hope that although the\nHarrington Bar & Grill \u201cis not a\nSouthside replacement\u201d it will be\njust as good.\nIt is important that students have\nan alternative to the Union. In\nprevious years the Union has failed\nto impress students, who instead\nfrequented Southside.\nAt present the Union is much\nbusier than it has been in previous\nyears lets hope that this is due to\nthe Union showing the students a\ngood time and not simply a case of\ntheir being no alternatives.\nRemove that hoody or we\u2019ll shoot!\nHoodies - not actually the police\u2019s\ntop priorities.\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nIncredibly this band doesn\u2019t sound\nlike a band called Film School, i.e.\nthey don\u2019t sound like Test Icicles\nor Art Brut. Instead they make a\nhypnotic semi-drone-rock kind of\nnoise. On & On in particular swirls\naround and around, drawing you in\nto its repeated rhythms with heavily\ndelayed guitars. They are fond of\nusing the trick that many, ahem, nu-shoegaze (sorry) bands use, namely\ndefining the chorus not by getting\nlouder or changing the tune, but just\nby adding more layers of noise.\nHarmed is really very good, and\npulls away from the fuzzy sounds\nfound elsewhere on this sampler.\nThe melody starts bouncy and\ndefined, until the chorus rapidly\nbursts onto the scene with circling,\nalmost psychedelic guitars, distorted variously to white noise, or to\nsound like organs.\nLess good is Pitfalls, let down\nmainly by its use of simplistic bass\nlines and annoying sliding guitar.\nAlso, I\u2019ve always thought that messing around with the settings on a\nkeyboard is best down before a song,\nnot during it. 11:11 brings the quality\nback, despite initially sounding like\npost-punk by numbers. Those trademark guitars that sound like they\nwere strummed ten minutes before\nany sound was made are all over\nthe track, as is a feeling of tension\nand disquiet. A simple motif is constantly and absorbingly repeated,\nright until the very end as the good\nol\u2019 wall of noise grows and grows.\nAnd grows some more.\nFilm School\u2019s name is misleading,\ntheir place of origin is misleading\n(San Francisco, not exactly home of\ninnovation), but their sound certainly isn\u2019t. One to watch , and probably\nbrilliant live.\nJames Millen\nThe Mars Volta live experience is\nvery different to the albums they\nproduce. TMV take a much more\nfluid role during live shows, often\nopting for 20 minute jamming sessions between album tracks. Having\nseen them in early 2005 on the\nFrances The Mute tour, where they\nperformed the entire gig with no\nsupports in an epic two and a half\nhour hour set, I felt I knew what to\nexpect from new live compilation\nScab Dates.\nThe album begins with one of\nOmar Rodriguez Lopez\u2019s sound\nexperiments; it sounds like a woman\nspeaking over a tannoy while instruments are tuned in. Presumably this\nis symbolic of the audience waiting\nfor TMV to begin their set. This\nslowly melts into Take The Vein\nCerpin Taxt which is an extended\nand free-flowing version of the track\nfrom the early EP Tremulant. In\nthis version, TMV take more time to\nexplore themselves and their track\nwith extended soloing and a sinister accordion \u2018solo\u2019 that breaks the\ntrack. Cavigula and Harsupex take\nthe form of live jam sessions and\nreally demonstrate their musical\ntalent. These tracks serve as tension builders for the album tracks,\nConcertina, Take The Vein Cerpin\nTaxt and Cicatriz that form the\nmajority of the album and they work\nwell as such.\nCicatriz itself is a 40 minute epic\nsplit into 5 distinct parts. The first\npart is eight minutes long beginning\nmuch like the album version of the\ntrack but drifting gently off course\ntowards the latter half into frequent\norgan and guitar solos. This soon\nflows into the second part - a much\nslower and relaxed portion. The\nslowness is broken near the end\nby some psychedelic guitar soloing\nthat culminates in the switch to the\nthird part. Part II - as it is called\n- is started with some audience\ncheers and quiet blues-like guitar\nriffs under Lopez\u2019s exhaustive vocal\ngymnastics. With some impressive\ninstrumental work in the last two\nparts of this marathon track, TMV\ncome to the end of this impressive,\nif slightly egotistical, 72 minute live\ncompilation.\nScab Dates feels like the album\nDe-loused In The Crematorium was\nintended to be with TMV being far\nmore willing to experiment in live\nperformances leading to the long\njams that take over many songs-much as in Frances The Mute. This\nCD however will definitely not win\nover many newcomers who have\nnot seen the somewhat magical live\nexperience of TMV live.\nThomas Whitson\nNu-prog is the new.. uhm, I dunno\nThe Mars Volta\u2019s live experience makes it to immortal CD form (I was surprised it would \ufb01t)\nmusic music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Mars Volta - resurrecting both the twenty minute drum solo and concept album in one fell swoop.\n10\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 24 November 2005\nFilm School\nOn & On (album sampler)\n(Beggars Banquet)\nHHHII\nFilm School - rockin\u2019 out. Probably for all the squares.\nThe Mars Volta\nScab Dates\n(Gold Standard Laboratories)\nHHHHH\nSINGLE REVIEWS\nSound the \u201cyet another male singer\nsongwriter\u201d alarm. I tentitivly put\nthe CD in my hi-fi, Bluntly expecting a song of Damien like evil. My\nrelief is total when I find that Tim\nWilliams creates vaguely epic, heavily atmospheric songs, in the style of\nTom McRae\u2019s softest moments. My\nBrooklyn is gorgeous, in a beautifully understated way. Mr Williams\nmakes up for his lack of vocal range\nwith a breathy romanticism, and\nexquisite use of space. Everything\nhas a warm and dreamy quality, akin\nto watching the world from under-water.\nA, the other track on the CD, is a\npretty standard acoustic strum, but\nnot gratingly annoying like so many\nof the boring men with guitars out\nthere. It\u2019s a shame that he doesn\u2019t\nmake it over to our shores very\noften, but it\u2019s maybe for the best if\nhis home (Brooklyn) inspires him to\nwrite such exemplary music.\nJames Millen\nNottingham quintet Computerman\nmake an achingly fashionable noise.\nThe synths are glitzy like The\nKillers, the guitars are sharp and\nfast like Bloc Party and the vocals\nare of the sincerely yearning sort\nyou hear all over the place. Still,\nunderneath it all the bands name\nchecked above are pretty ace. No\nMore Broken Hearts is obviously\ntheir flagship song, with a driving rhythm, emo harmonies, and\na suitably energetic chorus. Oddly,\nthey take to pronouncing words\nstrangely (not just a dialect thing,\nsince Midlandsers are sometimes\nindecipherable to my south coast\nears, they add syllables all over the\nplace), possibly for novelty factor\nfor more plays on MTV2. There\u2019s\na lush bit with handclaps though.\nWatch More Television, found\nlurking on the flip side, tries a little\ntoo hard. There are too many stops\nand starts, and an irritating tune in\nthe chorus. No Recover delves too\nfar into the dark depths of emo, with\na worrying injection of glam that\nmakes it all sound a bit King Adora.\nCertainly not bad, definitely not\noffensive, undoubtedly better than\nThe Bravery (as are genital warts),\nbut nothing new. Or exciting.\nMeh.\nJames Millen\nReading rock \u2018n\u2019 rollers Yankee\nNine Niner are making waves in the\nU.K music scene-quoted as saying\nthey are here to \u201cawaken us from our\nsleepyKeaneandColdplayslumber.\u201d\nYankee Nine Niner and their two\ntrack sampler simply rock. Where\nThe Darkness have seen fit to parody the staples of 80\u2019s rock Yankee\nNine Niner have grabbed them with\nboth hands and embraced them.\nOh Yeah has a great feel with\njazz chords and metal inspired solos\nsprinkled over the croaky, almost\ngrainy, vocals of singer Henry\nRundell.ThisisaclassicRock\u2018n\u2019Roll\ntrack wrapped up with some great\njazz guitar work. Giving Up is more\nabout the vocal, the track begins\nwith a slow paced breezy intro fading smoothly into Aerosmith-esque\nvocals that saves it from being\nentirely unremarkable. The track is\nmuch less impressive than Yankee\nNine Niner seem to be and is a bit\nof a let down compared to other\ntracks (www.purvolume.com/yan-keenineniner). I look forward to a\nsolid EP release from them to keep\nthe likes of The Darkness at bay.\nThomas Whitson\nTim Williams\nMy Brooklyn\n(Dovecote Records)\nHHHHI\nComputerman\nNo More Broken Hearts\n(Must Destroy)\nHHIII\nYankee Nine Niner\nYankee Nine Niner\n(The New Black Records)\nHHHII\n\n"

The\nattack, last November (Felix 1308)\nleft her father dead.\nTwo suspects, Damien Hanson and\nElliot White, both 24, are currently\non trial for murder and wounding\nwith intent. Richard Horwell for the\nprosecution said witnesses saw\nthe men fleeing the scene on 29\nNovember 2005. The attacks took\nplace minutes away from Evelyn\nGardens, the location of Imperial\nCollege halls of residence, in a three\nstorey townhouse on Upper Cheyne\nRow, Chelsea.\nThe attackers left both Mr.\nMonckton, 49 and his wife Homeyra,\n46 with several knife wounds to the\nchest and back. Monckton later died\nat Chelsea and Westminster hospital\nwhilst his wife underwent intensive\nsurgery, she eventually recovered.\nThe court heard how Monckton,\nhead of bonds management at Legal\nand General was \u201ctricked\u201d into\nopening the door to White, who was\nposing as a Royal Mail employee.\nWhite then forced his way into the\nhouse breaking a security chain on\nthe door with the help of Hanson\ndressed in a balaclava and brandishing a knife and firearm, it is alleged.\nHanson demand jewellery and cash\nfrom Ms Monckton.\nThe prosecution claims that\nHanson stabbed Ms Monckton in the\nback several times as she reached\nfor the panic alarm, before turning\nhis attention to Mr Monckton.

Nearly 10% of\nsixth forms in England do not offer\nthe subject at A level, and almost\n40% of sixth forms enter five or\nless candidates for exams. Half of\nphysics teachers hold no degree\nqualifications in the subject at all.\nWhat exactly discourages physics graduates from entering teach-ing? Felix asked a few physics\nundergraduates at Imperial their\nviews. The most popular reasons\nfor not entering teaching were the\nlow rates of pay and unenthusiastic pupils. Most sort careers in\nbanking and advertising.\nMin Guan\nBabar Ahmad protest\nLast Friday, 18 November, an\nimpromptu protest took place after\nIslamic Society Friday Prayers in the\nUnion building. It was in response to\nnews that Barbar Ahmad, a former\nIT support technician at Imperial\nCollege, was to be extradited to the\nUnited States (Felix 1335). Around\nsixty people protested at the deci-sion, and signatures were collected\nagainst the decision to extradite Mr\nAhmad. External press were present\nfrom the Wandsworth Borough News\nand Eastern Eye magazine.\nAn appeal against the decision to\nextradite Mr Ahmad is planned by\nthe family, as is a protest for the 11\nDecember in London.

Instead it has had to wait until this month\u2019s Council meeting\nfor the results to be counted.\nThe reason for this was not to do with the Electronic Voting system, but due to\ncomplaints about students who appeared to have broken election regulations.\nOnce this issue was highlighted, we had to investigate it.

    "content": "LIVE REVIEWS\nI received an email from my senior\ntutor bemoaning the improper use\nof the halls network for pirating\ncopyrighted material. It\u2019s a shame\nthat piracy is frowned on, because\nif this were widely enforced, people\nwould have no chance to access the\nback catalogue of the Decemberists\u2019\nwork. With only their latest album,\nPicaresque, due for release in the\nUK (on Rough Trade this sum-mer), the full excellence of this\nband of whimsical buccaneers from\nPortland, Oregon is in danger of\ngoing unnoticed in this country.\nThe support, San Fransisco two-piece act Two Gallants, with their\n\u201coff-the-heezy\u201d guitar work and\nvocals reminiscent of the tortured\nstrains of Bright Eyes and the tortured strains of Kurt Cobain, produced a wall of noise meant to pick\nyou up, throw you about and deny\nyou any rest until the end of their\nset. Their brand of Americana, with\nit\u2019s lyrics about murder and alcohol-ism, made them rather more than\nthe White Stripes knockoff they\nseemed at first sight, and definitely\nworth looking out for.\nAs the Decemberists came on,\nfears that the small stage of ULU\nwould be unable to accommodate\ntheir big band sound were instantly dismissed as the opened their\nset with The Infanta. The crowd\u2019s\nunusual familiarity with the songs\n(stemming, presumably, from piracy\nof copyrighted material) was evident\nas, in a feverish mood, they belted\nout each one in unison with frontman Colin Meloy\u2019s geeky voice.\nFrom the off, the Decemberists\nwere a joy to watch. It is generally joked that a master\u2019s degree in\nEnglish is required to follow their\nlyrics -- not a baseless claim as\neach song moves easily between\narticulately witty and atmospheric;\nan example is Eli The Barrow Boy,\ntheir contribution to the long tradition of murder ballads. Their songs\nare sometimes political as well, but\nnot hysterically so: witness their\nlatest single, the anthemic Sixteen\nMilitary Wives, an incisive but subtle look at America\u2019s political situ-ation.\nThroughout, the interaction with\nthe audience was superior, with the\nband treating the show as a surreal\nindie pantomime. Between each\nsong, Colin bantered with the crowd,\nand the band introduced humourous ad hoc elements, like a random\nviolin rendition of the Indiana Jones\ntheme in the middle of the escape-themed Bagman\u2019s Gambit. Later,\nit heated up as multi-instrumen-talist and Red Army Robin Hood\nChris Funk \u201cfell asleep\u201d mid-song,\nprompting Colin to force us to sit\ndown so he could rest undisturbed.\nIt all came to a head during the\nfinale, the epic Mariner\u2019s Revenge\nSong as the crowd were instructed\nto \u201cscream like a whale is chewing\nyou up\u201d, leaving us with a bizarre\nmix of well-pitched pirate-rock and\nscreams of \u201cBloody hell! It has\nteeth!\u201d ringing in our ears.\nThe Decemberists are one of those\nrare bands, absurd yet compelling,\nwho tax the eyes, ears and brain all\nat once. Showing more originality in\none show than most band\u2019s careers,\nthey\u2019ve certainly earned the self-applied name of their second album,\nHer Majesty. Long may she reign.\nTom Whitson\nAfter a typical indie-rock performance from the Bright Space, and\na less than inspiring performance from \u2018girl with a guitar type\u2019\nGemma Hayes, anticipation was\nhigh for Athlete\u2019s 2nd performance\nat the Hammersmith Apollo on\nthis tour. Athlete enter the stage to\nthe thunderous roar of applause.\nHaving waited a good few minutes\nfor the adulation from their fans to\ndie down, they played the popular\nYesterday Threw Everything At Me\nand Half-light, which were unsur-prisingly chanted back to Athlete by\nthe crowd word for word. From the\nreaction of the crowd and the magical atmosphere that Athlete create\nwith such ease, it becomes apparent\nthat this home-coming gig is going\nto be something special.\nAthlete continue to pull out crowd-pleasers, breaking into favourites\nfrom their debut album Vehicles And\nAnimals. Athlete\u2019s first ever single,\nthe sing-along favourite Westside\nand New Project with its slow intro\nlulling you into a false sense of\ncalm, prior to hitting you with the\ncrazy electronic unexpected middle\nsection go down a treat. Beautiful\nturns the venue into a ball of happiness and love, momentarily washing away any qualms anybody has,\nleaving the feeling, albeit it false, of\nperfection within the world.\nAthlete then ingeniously, yet effortlessly manage to make the gig seem\ntailor made to every individual lucky\nenough to be in the room. The gigantic curtains behind the band glide\nopen to reveal a huge screen, with a\nstreet map of London. Then On Your\nStreet commences, and the crowd\nare taken on a journey through\nLondon- through St James\u2019s Park,\nNotting Hill, Islington, Charing\nCross and more, accompanied by\ngasps, cheers and ahhs as people\nsee the familiar streets where they\nlive, work and grew up. The song\nsomewhat predictably, but no less\nspecially ends with the map zooming into the Hammersmith Apollo.\nAfter a few more popular tracks\nfrom their albums, Athlete then\nmanage to make a gig that is already\nturning out to be pretty awesome,\njust that little bit extra special, playing their emotionally charged tearjerker Wires. As Joel Potts beautifully sings the well known lyrics, you\nfeel sorry for anybody that doesn\u2019t\nhave somebody to hold, as thousands of friends and lovers embrace\nthroughout the song. Despite the\nwell documented and discussed,\nand lets be honest, blatantly obvious\ninspiration for the song (Joel Potts\n\u2018running down corridors, through\nautomatic doors, got to get to\u2019 his\nprematurely new-born and ill baby)\nan unusual twist is taken on the\nscreen. Whilst most people know\nthat the wires refer to those coming\nfrom his ill daughter, the screens\ntake the crowd on another jour-ney, along the wires of the London\nunderground-yet again, making the\ngig feel that little bit more personal.\nAfter leaving the stage, and returning for a much-called for encore,\nAthlete end their spectacular gig\nwith new single 24 Hours (which I\nhave been credibly informed was\nnot written about Jack Bauer or the\nUS show 24) and leave the stage to\nhuge cheering and miscellaneous\nnoise. Athlete can do no wrong and\nappeal to an impressive range of\npeople. They have the potential to\nbe huge, and hopefully, their next\nalbum will secure them a deserved\nplace as British musical legends.\nMatty H & Mark Hagen\nAthlete, having spent the last few\nmonths in the U.S. returned to the\nU.K. to play a sellout U.K. tour. We\nwere lucky enough to be given the\nopportunity to meet and interview\nAthlete drummer Steve Roberts\nbefore their gig at the Hammersmith\nApollo on the 2nd October.\nAs we were escorted to the Athlete\ndressing room, we were unsure what\nto expect from a band that have had\nsuch main stream success over the\nlast year, with the release of their\nlatest album Tourist. As soon as\nwe were inside and politely offered\nbeers, any visions of rock and roll\ndebauchery were shattered. Steve\nwas very down to earth, with his\nphysics teacher glasses and beard\nreflecting his unphased attitude\ntowards fame and success.\nHaving seen Athlete play a few\nweeks before in the Apple Store,\nRegent Street, we asked about the\nperformance and how it felt to play\na much more intimate set than unu-sual. Surprisingly beforehand they\nwere dreading playing the clean\nwhite store with its clinical sterile\natmosphere. Once they got on stage\nto the huge applause and the loud\ndrunk guy in the front row they\nreally let loose and enjoyed playing\nmore personal stripped down acoustic renditions of their classic hits to\nthe 400 strong crowd.\nDespite hitting the \u201cbig time\u201d with\nthe release of their latest album\nTourist, Athlete\u2019s rise to the top\nwas through relentless touring,\nslowly but surely building up a fanbase since the release of Vehicles\n& Animals. When asked about the\ncurrent music scene and young\nemerging bands, they dismissed any\ncomparisons to the Brit-pop era.\nThey share the feeling that Brit-pop\nwas an era of one image and one\nsounds, where now all genres and\nstyles are embraced with the same\nperson listening to The Streets,\nMorning Runner, Basement Jaxx\nand Roots Manuva. The embracing\nof such a diverse collection of music\nis likely to nourish many of the U.K.\nmusic scenes, which can only be a\ngood thing.\nTom Whitson &\nJenny Gibson\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAhoy there!\nThe Decemberists bring their odd blend of folk and surrealism to the UK\nThe Decemberists\nUniversity of London Union\nHHHHH\nThe Decemberists - favourites of hipsters with folk leanings everywhere.\nAthlete - they\u2019re not small, just far away.\nAthlete\nHammersmith Apollo\nHHHHI\n11\nfelix www.felixonline.co.uk\nThursday 24 November 2005\nAthlete\nPre-gig interview\n\n"

Beware of\nthe spicy ratings though- the divine\nNam Yang Manao which came with\na spicy warning was surprisingly\nrefreshing, whilst the supposedly\nmild Pho Xao Bo had a fierce kick.\nWashed down with a mango smooth-ie, though, it was nothing I couldn\u2019t\nhandle.\nThe time flew by and before long\nwell over an hour had flown by.

Oh yes it is.\nNo more body parts I\u2019m afraid these are too good\nAm I the Editor?\nI take it some of you were a little\noffended by what my Bar Wench\nwrote last week. What I have to say\nis, if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t read it.\nFirstly my Bar Wench writes as\nshes it. She saw a load of irritating yanks so she wrote about it. I\nthought it was very informative.\nThe two letters I have received\nhave been very interesting. Now the\nreviews. The bar wench has written\nanother fantasticly fabulous piece\nfor us. Not quite sure what it was\nabout as I was drunk when I put this\ntogether. Did I put in the picture of\nsomeone using the complaint as\ntoilet paper? I guess I should just\nget fired now.\nIn addition to this I thought I\nshould have something about the\nlady of the hour: Madonna at G-A-Y.\nAlso have something from my night\nat Renaissance.\nThe Nightlife Editor\nThe lady of the hour\nWell, I was told by a friend of mine\nthat I should apologise for my\ncruel generalisation and degradation of the American visitors to our\nbeloved Union. At first I considered their compassionate idea, but\nthen I thought: \u2018Hell no! Especially\nwhen they stroll in at 5 to 11 and\nask for pitchers of Guinness. The\nmoronic, stupid, loud gits shouldn\u2019t\nbe allowed! Bloody cheek!\u2019\nAnyways, as my manic, midget\nobsessed editor says, no point flogging a dead coke whore. This week\nis binge drinking. Now, guys, I think\nyou all must have heard about, even\nseen in our very own Union this\nawful trend in society today, this evil\ncorrupting minds, bodies and souls.\nWhatabsolutebollocks!I\u2019msorrybut\nwho has ever thought: \u201cOh no, that\u2019s\nmy third pint of Carlsberg, better\nstop or else I\u2019ll be binge drinking\u201d?\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is when\ndid four pints suddenly change from\nbeing a normal amount of drinks to\nan obscene number of units that will\nend up in numerous cancers and\nliver failure? To be honest, if that\u2019s\nthe case, I\u2019m guaranteed a dose of\nmouth cancer and sclerosis of the\nliver before I\u2019m 25. Oh well, we\u2019ve all\ngot to die of something.\nWill it deter us from drinking ourselves into comas? Somehow I don\u2019t\nthink so. It would be like giving an\nobese person an unlimited supply of\ncake. Five hours later and you know\nthe puke bin will have to be reached\nfor so they can start all over again. I\nknow it\u2019s so that people don\u2019t cram\nfourty units into half an hour but\ncome on Tony, show me an intoxicated person who thinks: \u201cHmm I\u2019ve\ngot four hours left, therefore I will\nonly drink beverages of one unit and\nalternate it with water\u201d. Not bloody\nlikely.\nWe are students, drinking ourselves stupid is part of the lifestyle.\nOh no, is this a piece of journalism\nI see before me? I bloody hope not!\nWhere\u2019s my bottle of vodka?\nThe Bar Wench Just a little bit gay\nAlright, I\u2019ll get the boring stuff over\nwith first. Renaissance at The Cross\ncosts about \u00a320, but this can change\ndepending if the guy at the till likes\nyou or thinks you\u2019re hot. But really,\nI would say its worth going out once\na week to somewhere really good\ninstead of going out 4 times a week\nto all those skanky holes we all love.\nI mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I love\nthe smell of vomit and piss when I\nwalk into a place. That\u2019s why we all\nlove Prospect. Well if you\u2019ve started drinking homemade snakebite\nbefore going out at 11pm then you\nknow you are in for a dirty night.\nAfter a hot drunken Tube ride to\nKing\u2019s Cross, my friend Trish and\nme had to make our way through\nwhat can only be described as the\nultimate in rape alleys.\nWe managed to avoid rape, mur-der, or worse still, having someone\nstart to approach you, about to mug\nyou, and then realising you\u2019re not\nworth it and clearing off (I mean\nI don\u2019t look too much like a tramp\ndo I).\nGetting in was no problem but we\ndid get accosted by several people\nin big hats screaming in some funny\nlanguage. I think they were probably\nnorthern or something, or perhaps\nAustralian.\nWhen we arrived the place was\nalready rammed. People were\nsweating like a paedophile in mother care or like the really obese man\non the bus on the way home. If you\ntake up two seats you should pay\ntwice as much!\nThe music initially was very beige\nand bland. It may not sound bad but\ncould you imagine your friends calling you beige or magnolia? It would\nbe enough to make you slit your\nwrists and sit in a warm bath. I know\nsome people should, but still. After\nventuring around the various sweat\npits we ended up outside dancing\nin the rain. If any of you have been\nto The Cross you will know its an\namazing venue. Not very big but its\nreally individual; lots of palm trees.\nSorry another slight tangent\nthere. The range of music was quite\nincredible, I was truly surprised.\nQuite often when you go to a club\nthey tend to stick to one genre of\nmusic: be it hard, funky or dirty\nhouse. It was refreshing to be able\nto go from room to room and actually feel something different.\nAaron Mason\nRennaisance @ The Cross\n\u201cI don\u2019t look too\nmuch like a tramp do\nI?\u201d\nFor those of you who didn\u2019t realise,\nperhaps you\u2019ve been living in a cave\nor haven\u2019t had your head out of a\ntextbook in a while, Madonna is back\n\u2013 with a vengeance. Her new album\nis a glittering fusion of retro funk\nand future disco and, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s\njust a little bit gay.\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that just four\ndays after her spectacular album\nlaunch at Koko she put on a very\nspecial show for the little dancing\nqueens of London at the countries\nmost brand labelled gay club, G-A-Y.\nHosted at the Astoria Theatre on\nCharing Cross Road, G-A-Y has a\nlive act nearly every Saturday of\nthe year, ranging from the legendary Britney Spears herself (woo\nhoo) to, ahem, Daphne and Celeste\n(bless, they did try). The great thing\nabout seeing an act at G-A-Y is that\nthe rest of the night is one super-fun-happy party with super-cheap\ndrinks. Without a doubt this show\nwas by far the best live performance\never held at G-A-Y.\nAfter weeks of teasing snippets of\ninformation, mysterious disco ball\nposters that never once used the\nword \u2018Madonna\u2019 and hours of queuing for tickets on a cold, cold morning in Soho, the lucky two thousand\nthat made it in were going for it like\nDuracell Bunnies - pink, fluffy and\nabsolutely hyper. I\u2019d like to say I\nfeel I truly suffered for my ticket as\nin my excitement at the prospect of\nstanding around on the street for\ntwo hours I spilled hot coffee down\nmyself and ruined a perfectly good\nscarf in the process. By the age of\ntwenty you\u2019d think I could use a\nsippy cup, but no.\nThe songs were taken almost\nexclusively from her new album,\nopening with \u2018Hung Up\u2019 before partying through \u2018Let It Will Be\u2019, \u2018Get\nTogether\u2019, \u2018I Love New York\u2019 and\nfinishing with a remixed classic in\nthe form of \u2018Everybody\u2019.\nFortunately for die hard old-school\nMadonna fans, the DJ sets for the\nnight were very Madge heavy with\nat least a solid hour of her best\nknown hits either side of the Queen\nof Pop herself \u2013 including my personal favourite part of the night,\nwhen, where you would expect an\nencore, the anthemic \u2018Like a Prayer\u2019\nbegan to play and the crowd went\nnuts with wails of \u201cOh My GOD! I\ncan\u2019t BELIEVE she\u2019s gonna sing\nTHIS!\u201d They kept going nuts until\nhalf way through the song when they\nfinally realised it was just a DJ track\nand Madonna had long since left the\nbuilding. Bless \u2018em. She didn\u2019t even\nsay goodbye, which was the perfect\nend to the set. Harsh but effective\nand the most memorable ending for\nthe most memorable night the club\nhas ever hosted.\nMike Case\nLook at her go!

For those of us\nwithout strong sympathies toward\nthis person it seems an abuse of the\npower of a president to set a policy\nwhich is either redundant or potentially offensive.

Ought not the president\nretract her support for this campaign given its inflammatory and\nheavily biased nature?\nWhy does the president not feel\na fair trial will be given in the US?\nFor those of us who realise that\na death penalty of Babar Ahmed\nis not at all likely, a campaign to\nprevent fair trial in the US rather\nthan to fair trial in the UK seems to\nexpress merely an anti-american\nsentiment, hardly a sentiment\nwhich should be shared by the\npresident of an organisation which\nought to represent the americans\nwithin the college.\nThis contrasts with the\nneighbouring article on the front\npage of Felix (ULU council chair\nsent packing). Whilst we should\nsupport the removal of a person\nin a union body who seems to\nhave such homophobic tendencies\nsince he surely cannot be a fair\nrepresentative of the homosexual\nmembers of that union, why should\nthe American members of our\nunion be represented by somenone\nwho possesses and acts upon anti-american tendencies?\nOught not the President and\nthe council not hold an impartial\nposition toward political causes\nwithin the Union? Would it be right\nfor the Union to allow Conservative\nSociety meetings but ban the\nLiberals from meeting within its\nbuildings? The impartiality of our\nUnion is important given that\nit ought to be representing all\ncultures and political persuasions\nwithin the university. Just as ULU\nwould not support homophobia\nwithin its council we ought not\nallow such clear anti-american\nsentiment to fester in ours.\nAndrew McGlashon, Physics\nSameena Misbahuddin, Imperial\nCollege Union President, replies:\nDear Andrew,\nI wanted to write to clarify a few\npoints made in your letter. The\npolicy that\u2019s being discussed was\nset by Union Council in December\n2004(see www.union.ic.ac.uk/\ncouncil), and not by me as an indi-vidual. Therefore I\u2019m not abusing\nLetters to the editor\n24\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 24 November 2005\nStar\nLetter\nThe Bar Wench\nDear Editor,\nAt risk of taking \u201cThe Bar Wench\u201d\nmore seriously than she deserves,\nI must respond to the xenophobic,\nhateful views expressed in \u201cThe\nWench Returns\u201d in the Nightlife\nsection of Felix on 17 November,\n2005.\nOn the surface the piece uses the\njuvenile humour of the \u201cFat Slags\u201d\nvariety; but it also exposes a troubled ego that is threatened by those\nwho speak, dress, and interact\ndifferently. Fear is, of course, the\nmother of hatred. The opening comparison with vermin, meant jokingly (of course), is as disturbing as\nthose insults levelled, with narrow-minded persistence throughout our\nshared history, against a range of\n\u201coutsiders\u201d who seem to threaten\nour way of life simply because they\nare different (Jews, Irish, Punks,\nCaribbeans, Muslims, Women,\nCatholics, Welsh, Homosexuals,\nPakistanis, Scots, etc.)\nJokes are to be laughed at, but\nto compare someone with a sexu-ally-transmitted disease is to turn\na joke into a weapon of nationalist,\nxenophobic destructiveness. The\nreduction of a young woman to\n\u201ca pig in a girdle\u201d puts \u201cThe Bar\nWench\u201d on the same level as those\nnationalists who dehumanize their\nperceived enemy so as to justify\ngenocidal atrocities.\nOnly someone who is both obnoxiously arrogant and extremely\ninsecure would set out to represent\nher enemy -- \u201cattractive, lovely\u201d\nAmerican girls - as vermin, as\nbeasts, as a biological infection.\nMy hope, as an Englishman and\nas a teacher, is that your readers\ncan see that \u201cThe Wench Returns\u201d\nsays more about the vitriolic hatred\nof \u201cThe Bar Wench\u201d than it does\nabout the students who help pay\nher rent, who help make ICU a\nmore interesting place, who are\nhere to learn about British culture\nfrom the many students at ICU\nwhose minds are more open to difference than hers.\nStephen John Dilks, PhD\nAssociate Professor of English and\nIrish Literature\nDirector of Faculty Center for\nExcellence in Teaching\nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas\n(UMKC)\nAaron Mason, Nightlife Editor,\naddresses, the comments\nregarding last week\u2019s Nightlife in\nhis editoral, page 15.\nThe author of the \u2018star\u2019\nletter received each\nweek will win \u00a310\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nmy position as President; it\u2019s my\njob to uphold the policy already\nset by Council \u2013 and to represent\nthe views of Imperial students. As\nI said to Felix last week \u2013 \u201cUnion\nCouncil set policy to support\nBabar having a fair trial in the UK\nand it\u2019s disappointing that after\nour students\u2019 efforts, which were\nmost prominent last year, it hasn\u2019t\nprevented the Home Secretary\u2019s\ndecision. - the policy still stands,\nso continues to be supported by\nthe Union.\u201d .Though the policy was\nset last academic year, Union policies do not lapse for 3 years unless\nspecifically revoked, therefore it\nstill holds (more information about\nthe governance and policies of the\nUnion can be found at www.union.\nic.ac.uk/resource).\nAny policy is voted on by Union\nCouncil before it can become\nUnion policy. Union Council has 50\nmembers representing the different\nparts of the Imperial student body.\nAny student can attend Union\nCouncil meetings to give their\nviews and feedback and therefore\nif policy is set it represents the\nviews of a substantial number of\nthe student body.\nFor the Union or any individual\nto oppose actions or policy decisions of the current American\nadministration doesn\u2019t equate to\nbeing anti-American in anyway\nwhatsoever. Many Americans,\nincluding American students, hold\na similar position to that of the\nUnion, and they are not of course\n\u2018anti-American\u2019 for doing so. Had\nthe policy been seen to be anti-American, then it wouldn\u2019t have\npassed as it would have breached\nthe Union\u2019s Equal Opp\u2019s Policy.\nThe reasoning behind the policy\nwas not anti-American, but that\nBabar, as a British Citizen, should\nhave his trial in Britain and not\nelsewhere.\nAs President, my role is to represent ALL students regardless of\nrace, religion, nationality or anything else and students should not\nsee this policy as anti-American,\nby me nor by the Union as a whole\n\u2013 the Union represents all cultures\nand all students and any prejudice\nagainst any part of the Imperial\ncommunity will not be tolerated\nor supported by the Union. The\nUnion is apolitical and deals with\nissues affecting students as stu-dents. However as Babar was a\nformer student of this College and\nthe policy also addresses the wider\nissues of civil liberties, the policy\nwas passed by Union Council.\nI Hope this clears things up.\nSameena\nICU President\nThe policy as passed can be seen\nat http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/\nresource/governance/babarahmed.\nhtml\nSarah Khatib on\nLuca Manfredi\nSo why did I abstain after all?\nCouncil Chairs are not expected to\nhave no views at all; rather, they\nare expected not to show any in\ntheir role.\nI believe Luca Manfredi\u2019s comments were violent and homopho-bic; and posting them on a public\nwebsite demonstrates bad conduct.\nHowever, these comments were not\nmade when he was in office.\nWe cannot look back at each individual officer\u2019s past and rule them\nout because of what they had said\nhowever long ago it was before they\nwere in office. Where do we draw\nthe line? At one, five, ten years?\nBy abstaining, I was not condoning his actions and did not \u201csit back\nand plead impartiality\u201d. I made a\nclear statement against the motion,\nwhich was setting a precedent that\nI felt was unacceptable.\nWe are still students, we make\nmistakes, we repent, we apologise\nand we grow; Manfredi had the\nchance to apologise and prove himself at the most recent ULU Council\nmeeting.\nI could not vote against the\nmotion because the statements\nManfredi put forward in defence of\nhimself were inadequate and portrayed an incompetency as Council\nChair but at the same time, I could\nnot vote in favour because I believe\nthat it would set an inappropriate\nprecedent. I expressed these views\nby abstaining.\nSarah Khatib, ICU Deputy\nPresident Education and Welfare\nRethink Rubbish\nDear Felix,\nI fully agree with Andrew\nMcConville\u2019s article \u201cRethink\nRubbish: Reuse and Recycle\u201d: recycling is a vital issue for Imperial\nCollege to tackle. I would say that\nthe change in attitude that Andrew\nspeaks of is a matter of appreciating that recycling is not about making environmentalists happy but\nis simply the most intelligent and\nefficient thing to do.\nThis shift in attitude is underway\nacross European countries, businesses and communities, and\nindeed here at Imperial College.\nFor example, my fellow students\nin the Department of Electrical &\nElectronic Engineering (which,\nlet\u2019s face it, can hardly be accused\nof being environmental) have been\nquestioning the limited recycling\nfacilities and the fact that paper\nis simply thrown away. They have\ndone so not because they like trees,\nbut because they are engineers\n\u2013 good engineers \u2013 and object to\nwasteful and unintelligent solu-tions.\nAs an Imperial student, I would\nobviously like to think that Imperial\nis a champion of intelligent solu-tions. Yet, as Andrew mentions,\nCambridge and Oxford are ahead\nof us in terms of sustainability\nmeasures. Even the LSE has clever\nenergy-efficiency lighting control\ntechnology in their library.)\nLet\u2019s bring Imperial\u2019s waste management into the 21st century with\na well-functioning recycling system.\nEllin Barklund\n4th year, Electrical & Electronic\nEngineering\nPage 3\nDear Felix,\nFarewell to page 2. Picture this:\nlittle me sitting on the train on my\nway home from university, quite\nsmugly pulling out the latest copy\nof Felix which I\u2019d hidden under my\narm. My secret weapon!! Any Tom,\nDick or Harry could get a copy of\nThe Guardian, but me? Oh no, I\nwas a member of the elite. I had\nmy Felix. With it\u2019s intelligent layout\nand flawless design, my Felix was\nbound to beat the other literary\nmaterials scattered around the\ntrain carriage in the hands of Mr\nBanker and Ms French Tourist.\nAs I opened my beloved Felix,\nI could sense that my friend\nfrom across the channel was not\nimpressed. The intelligent content\nand flawless design had also failed\nto register with self important\nbanker whose icy stares I could feel\nraising the hairs on the back of my\nneck.\nWhen I eventually dropped my\nsmug gaze to the paper in my\nhands, I found to my utter amaze-ment, not one, not two, but three\npale forms splayed across the originally entitled page 3. Just where\ndid they come up with a name like\nthat?\nFor a second I thought I\u2019d picked\nup the wrong paper. But no, when I\nglanced back at the front page the\nword \u2018felix\u2019 stared back at me.\nIs the world going mad? Evidently\nso. Am I the only one outraged by\nthe rather strange attempts at indecent exposure by our peers? Again,\nevidently so!\nMy eyes have been scarred but\nothers out there can still be saved.\nLet us stop this degradation of our\nswanky high calibre paper. If you\u2019re\nreally desperate for some naked\nscience then head down to the\nScience Museum during your lunch\nbreak. I personally will be gluing\npages 2 and 3 together in order to\nsave my eyes and mind from further pollution.\nAlea El-damanawi\nRupert Neate, Felix Editor,\nreplies:\nDear Alea,\nDo you not like the concept or was\nit just those 3 \u201cpale forms\u201d?\nAlea El-damanawi, respones:\nDear Rupert,\nTechnically it\u2019s more the concept,\nI\u2019ve seen many a girl look away in\nhorror this week. I don\u2019t think guys\nmind it as much but then again\ntheir eye candy seems to be of a\nbetter quality then what the ladies\nget.\nRupert Neate:\nI hope you don\u2019t say that when I\npose for the last issue of year.\nAlea El-damanawi:\nYour intending to pose? My my, I\u2019ll\nget the word out, better print some\nextra copies of felix when u do!\nYou should do it sitting on a piccadilly line train reading a copy of the\nfelix and put it next to my letter...\n\n"

Jarhead is the\nunvarnished story straight through\nthe eyes of the then 20-year-old kid,\nwho told of a very different war from\nthe one delivered in print or over\nthe air.\nJarhead offers a ground up perspective of the Gulf War, live with\nshootings of burning oil wells and\nnight-skies lit by comet-like flames.\nThe recruits are rowdy, horny,\nexhilarated and also terrified that at\nany moment, over the next hill, the\nwar might begin.

The Japanese company is already both more profitable\nand more valuable than GM, and is\nset to produce 9.2m cars this year.\nGM last week shocked the markets by announcing that it had overstated earnings for 2001 and the second quarter of this year. The restatements mean GM has so far this year\nlost $3.8bn (\u00a32.1bn). The accounts\nfor the three years between 2001\nand 2005 are also under question,\nand GM\u2019s share price has fallen to\nits lowest level in since 1992.\nEarlier this year the ratings agen-cies, who determine the cost of borrowing for companies, downgraded\nthe credit ratings of both GM and\nFord, the world\u2019s third largest auto-manufacturer, raising their costs of\nborrowing for fears that the companies would not generate enough\ncash to pay the interest on the their\nborrowings.\nAdding to the woes of the American\nauto-manufacturers are the rising\nemployee provisions. GM estimates\nthat its pensions and healthcare\ncosts total $90bn and $77bn respec-tively.

China claims to have\nreserves of 1.3m tonnes of cop-per, but analysts put the figure at\ncloser to 200,000.

I understand the\nargument, but it is about as apparent as Daffyd\u2019s sexual orientation!\nUnless it is clear television execs\ninsisted the program be toned down\nfor popular channels, surely the program is crap because of its creators\u2019\nfaults?\ntv\nYou are forgiven for thinking that\nthis article might be dealing with the\nseedy underworld of entertainment\npiracy. It is not about some shady\nbloke called Garth, who flogs dodgy\nDVDs from the boot of his Ford\nSierra in some dingy alley. In fact, I\nam preaching to you and demanding\nthe attention of the Channel 4 execs.\nThis show is genius. It is criminal\nthat it has not been released on\nDVD.\nMatthew Holness, who starred\nbriefly in The Office, plays Garth\nMarenghi. Marenghi is a prolific\nhorror writer, no, dream-weaver. His\ncannon of famous chillers includes:\n\u2018Slicer\u2019, \u2018Juggers\u2019 and \u2018Afterbirth\u2019,\nthe last of which tells of a mutated\nplacenta that attacks Bristol. During\nthe 1980s, Marenghi wrote, directed\nand starred in a program so \u201cradical, dangerous and God-damned\ncrazy\u201d the television corporations\ndenied showing it. Now, these companies have come back to Marenghi\nand asked him to unleash the horror\non the unsuspecting public \u2013 that\u2019s\nyou and I. This creation is the \u201cmost\nsignificant televisual event since\nQuantum Leap\u201d: Darkplace.\nDarkplace is a hospital drama\nwith a twist: supernatural occurrences are the norm around these\nwards. Marenghi plays Rick Dagless\nMD, \u2018Dag\u2019 to his friends. One of his\ngood buddies is Sanchez, although\nthese cats occasionally do have\npunch-ups. Liz is the new girl on\nthe block, complete with telekinetic\npowers. Each of them sports a classic 80s mullet, including Liz with\nwhat can only be described as the\nfemale equivalent. Their boss is the\nlegendary Thornton Reed, donning\nbushy afro. Together, this unstoppable team overcomes any difficulties\nthat the underworld throws at them.\nThe doctors deal with an evil highland force known as \u201cScotch Mist\u201d,\npossessed kitchen utensils and\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLast weeks Little Britain was certainly not toned down. In a super-market, David Walliams played OAP\nMrs Emery. We expect something\nfishy to happen. She starts natter-ing to a friend: \u201cBlah, blah, bl\u2026\u201d\nUrea-ka! The flood gates opened!\nWalliams is wetter than a [edited\n- I crossed the line.] as she starts\ngushing piss onto the floor! Cringeworthy: I smiled through my fingers covering my eyes. Smiled, not\nlaughed.\nWe saw the return of Bubbles,\ndarling. First, a predictable joke:\n\u201cAre you sticking to your diet Mrs\nDeVere?\u201d asks someone. \u201cI\u2019m just\nhaving Special K this morning\u201d\nreplies Bubbles carrying a stacked\ntray of cereal boxes. Second: two\nmen rolling around in fat suits. It\njust didn\u2019t cut the mustard. Last\nseries, Bubbles was shockingly\nfunny. This was more like Takeshi\u2019s\nCastle on Bravo!\nFew new characters meant the old\nguard needed to save the show. Matt\nLucas must have had a back, sack\nand crack. Shamelessly, dressed in\nan outrageous thong, Daffyd had\n\u201cbecome a rent-boy Myfanwy\u201d. Good\nsketch, but no classic. Andy or Lou,\nI forget which one. It\u2019s like Ant and\nDec, Dick and Dom; guessing who\u2019s\nwho. The \u2018cripple\u2019 then, went swimming with sharks and parachuting:\nmore smiles. The best was probably\nfrom \u201cV to the P\n, icky to the ollard\u201d\nwho had a dance off, Run DMC style.\nHer break dancing was phat. Not\nonly \u201cp-h\u201d but pretty \u201cf\u201d fat too as\nher home girls spun her round as\nconvincingly as a beached whale.\nOverall, it was enjoyable. Much better than the half-arsed slapstick of\nThe Worst Week of My Life that\nfollowed, but rarely belly-aching.\nQuick mention about Lost:\nSawyer\u2019s turn. A better episode as\nalways when focussed on him, but\nwe still got nowhere with the main\nplot. Oh well. Lastly, I also caught\na bit of Children In Need which is\ngreat fun if you like watching kids\ndying and celebrities\u2019 careers dying\ntoo.\nTomo Roberts\nR\neal shocker this week.\nFirstly, I barged into\nLynnie\u2019s something\npast midnight like a root\nrat on heat. Being a bit\nworse of the turps I crashed out\non her sofa and smooched the dog\ncome morning. Bit awkward, as you\nmight imagine, after that. Funnily\nenough, that Janelle patched us up\nproper. Closer than two bills in the\nwet season now; and her kissing is\n100% on Harvey\u2019s.\nThe poor gal is worried about\nme, now that I got some graft with\nPaul \u201cThe Slime\u201d Robinson. But,\nnah! A bloke like me knows when\nhe\u2019s being conned, plus I\u2019m in need\nof the bees and honey. You see, I\ngotta start paying my way now Old\nDavie boy ain\u2019t gunna be too happy\nsince his daughter is having the\nnaughty with some pommie bikini\nshop owner from over the road, and\nHazzer\u2019s been giving us grief since\nI got back from the bush. Bunch of\nwowsers I say!\nTalking of wowsers, Dylan got\ndone up and down proper in the coffee shop by some school boy. I told\nthe kid to get off the grass and give\nthe drongo a dinky-di seeing too,\ncos I ain\u2019t having my Sky courting\na pansy.\nAnyway, hooroo for now!\nJoe Mangel\nLast weeks TV DVD Crime\nin another episode Dag becomes\nattached to a randy mutant eye.\nThe action takes place on\nretro, cheap, poorly lit sets; think\nDiagnosis Murder piss-take.\nUpbeat electronic music accompanies the actors running through\nhospital hallways. Running in slow\nmotion not for dramatic effect, but\nto compensate for the eight minutes\nMarenghi didn\u2019t have script to fill.\nThe picture is faded and sound out\nof sync. In one scene, Dag goes\nto leave Reed\u2019s office. He stops\u2026\n\u201cWait one moment\u201d, commands\nReed. Another sees Dag and Reed\nshooting at a demon. \u201cBoom, boom\u201d\nfires Reed. The camera switches.\n\u201cBang\u201d shoots Dag, Reed stands\nstraight. The camera returns: Reed\nstill trigger-happy. There are many,\nmany hilarious touches. Darkplace\ntakes our nostalgia and runs away\nwith it, then makes it explode into\nmillions of pieces. Incidentally,\nMarenghi knows what it\u2019s like to\nexplode. Don\u2019t ask him why: he just\nknows.\nIt\u2019s been a while since Darkplace\nwas aired. I cannot understand\nwhy this isn\u2019t on DVD yet! Maybe\nGarth Marenghi doesn\u2019t want to be\nresponsible for an insomnia epi-demic. Imagine it being released on\nBetamax to complete the retro feel.\nHeck, I\u2019d buy a player just for this.\nWhatever, this must be released.\nChannel 4: your arse is grass and\nI\u2019m the lawnmower, you dig?\nTomo Roberts\n27\nfelix\nThursday 24 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nStrewth!\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nfelix\nThursday 24 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nWomen now represent approximately 50% of the 39.4 million living\nwith HIV worldwide, with higher\nproportions (up to 60%) in the worst\naffected areas such as Sub-Saharan\nAfrica.\nIn addition to an increased biological susceptibility to infection\n(owing to significant mucous exposure to seminal fluids), women are\nat a greater risk due to issues of\ngender inequality such as non-con-sensual sex and the poverty-driven\nneed for commercial sex. The\nwell-known ABC mantra (Abstain,\nBe faithful, use Condoms) is not\nalways applicable in developing\ncountries, where the decision to\nuse a condom often rests with\nthe male. Analyses looking at the\noutcome of HIV infection based\non gender have highlighted a 33%\nhigher mortality rate in women\nparticipating in various studies,\nin part due to lack of access to\nhealth care and social support.\nRedressing the balance of power\nis crucial if we are to lessen the\nimpact of HIV on this currently\nvulnerable population.\nIt has been accepted that the\ncreation of a vaccine, the \u2018holy\ngrail\u2019 of HIV research, is still a\nlong way off and therefore improving preventative measures in\nthe meantime is paramount. The\ndevelopment of vaginal micro-bicides, as a method of reducing HIV transmission that gives\ncontrol to women, has stimulated\nmuch interest. These are chemical agents (various forms such\nas gels, creams, tablets and suppositories are available) used by a\nwoman before sexual intercourse.\nThree types of compounds with\ndiffering mechanisms of action are\ncurrently being investigated. One\nsuch chemical works by destroying the envelope surrounding\nthe virus. However, high toxicity\nof such compounds may cause\nlocal irritation and inflammation,\nwhich could enhance\ntransmission of HIV\nand other STDs. For\nthis reason, new\nstructures with lower\nvaginal toxicity are\nbeing developed.\nOther polymers act\nby blocking the entry\nof HIV into cells, and\nthe third candidate\nfor a microbicide\nacts by blocking\nviral replication.\nWomen in developing countries do not\nhave the wealth of\ncontraceptive options\nthat are available in\nthe Western world, and so there is\npotential to develop microbicides\nwith a spermicidal action, which\nmay increase their appeal for\nwomen.\nThe rapid dissemination of HIV\ninfection must be stemmed and,\nsince heterosexual intercourse\nrepresents the majority of newly\nacquired infections, a preventative\nmethod giving control to women\nis highly desirable. However,\ndespite the potential held by vaginal microbicides, there are many\nissues surrounding the acceptability of such a measure. Alongside\nthe need for clinical efficacy, it is\nessential for social and behavioural factors to be taken into account.\nStudies of men in Zimbabwe and\nSouth Africa have highlighted concerns over safety and side effects\nsuch as infertility, as well as other\nproblems, such as the use of such\nmeasures indicating lack of trust\nin a partner, meaning that their\nuse in long-term relationships\nis limited. Men generally did not\nwant a microbicide to act simultaneously as a contraceptive, and\nmany indicated that they would\nbe angry if they discovered their\nwives to be using microbicides\nwithout permission. Interestingly,\nmany women also indicated that\ncovert use of such a product was\nnot welcomed, perhaps mostly\nbecause of the risk of discovery.\nSuch studies indicate the difficulty\nof the battle we face in order to\nchange attitudes towards women;\nhowever, perhaps measures\nsuch as microbicides, which give\nwomen a degree of control in their\nrelationships, are a small step\ntowards this goal.\nRuvandhi Nathavitharana\nMEDSIN\nImperial AIDS Awareness Week\n26 November \u2013 2 December\nSat 26th: \u201cPeople, Possiblities,\nand Promises\u201d conference,\nCharing Cross Hospital\nMon 28th, Tue 29th:\nIC Drama Society Play\nTue 29th: Debate\nThu 1st: Vigil\nFri 2nd: Party\nFor more information, visit\nwww.positivelyred.co.uk or contact\noliver.todd@ic.ac.uk.

Alex Proyas,\ndirector of I, Robot, sees\na future of auto-piloted\ncars, friendly robots,\nand other high-tech, environmentally clean gadgets. Ridley Scott,\ndirector of Blade Runner, sees flying cars, androids, and pollution. So\nwhich is it? Are we heading towards\nan emissions-free, fossil fuel-free\neconomy, or will we maintain our\ncurrent emissions trends?\nMost people have probably never\nheard of BedZED \u2013 Beddington Zero\n(Fossil) Emissions Development.\nBedZED is the first and largest\nUK eco-village. The mixed development complex includes 100 homes\nand additional office space. More\nimportantly, however, it claims to\nbe carbon neutral. In other words,\nBedZED is not meant to contribute\nto global warming through the emission of carbon dioxide and other\npollutants.\nRecently, the Imperial College\nbranch of Engineers Without\nBorders (EWB) visited BedZED and\nhad a look at how exactly this community functions.\nPersonally, I was very sceptical\nabout the project\u2019s success. I expected to be let down either because\nit would turn out to have \u2018hidden\u2019\nemission sources or because I would\nencounter uptight tree-hugging hip-pies, running around and preaching\nagainst other people\u2019s dirty way of\nlife on the outside.\nHere\u2019s what I found out. They have\na highly effective recycling system,\ntreat all of their waste water and\nreuse it (though they do bring in\nnew drinking water), use solar panels and a Combined Heat and Power\n(CHP) system run on woodchip\nwaste (which would otherwise have\nbeen burnt or put into landfills), and\nhave no heating or air conditioning.\nSo here\u2019s the flaw! How do these\npeople put up with the cold winter\nmonths (and \u2018hot\u2019 summer days)?\nLarge double-glazed windows provide for a greenhouse type of heating effect and prevent heat loss.\nThe offices are built on the lower\nlevels, so that heat generated by\nelectronic equipment cycles up into\nthe living areas. This still leaves one\nimportant qustion about air quality\nunanswered.\nHow do you guarantee good quality fresh air if you don\u2019t have forced\nor natural ventilation? A highly creative ventilation system using a heat\nexchanger based on simple aerodynamic principles ensures that fresh\nair enters while \u2018contaminated\u2019\nair is expelled, and heat inside the\nhouse is maintained without need\nfor energy input. (I know you are all\nimpressed, even if you are a big fan\nof fossil fuels).\nWhat\u2019s not so positive about this\nhighly innovative community then?\nFirstly, these \u2018tree huggers\u2019 are\nguilty of driving your conventional\nhighly polluting internal combustion\npetrol cars. Sure, they do have a car-sharing system, which means they\ndon\u2019t drive everywhere they go, but\nthe cars still use petrol!\nSecondly, the insulation material\nGiving women control in HIV prevention\nused in the houses is highly damaging to the environment. The people\nat ZEDFactory tolds us that despite\nthe negative environmental impacts\nof these materials, the overall result\nwas overwhelmingly positive.\nIn fact, these were the only two significant disadvantages of BedZED.\nWhich means it does quite well from\nan environmental perspective.\nSo where were all the crazy tree\nhuggers? Actually, the people living\nthere were rather down-to-earth.\nMy real problem was that despite\nhaving been reassured that most of\nthem were friendly and highly integrated in the community, the place\nlooked like a graveyard. It reminded me of books like The Giver or\nFahrenheit 451, where society has\nreached some kind of utopian lifestyle through brain washing!\nMaybe this is a touch too extreme\nand while I was impressed by\nBedZED, why weren\u2019t simpler solutions appropriate to larger communities implemented? If you face real-ity, people require \u2018luxuries\u2019, such\nas computers, heating and air con-ditioning, cars, and so on. Why not\ntry to provide them with the same\nbut more efficient energy-conserv-ing technologies, without being as\nradical as BedZED.\nAs engineering and science stu-dents, we found visiting BedZED\nquite an interesting experience. One\nday we\u2019ll all have to realise that the\nway we abuse of our scarce natural\nresources will end up harming our\nown children, if not us. BedZED\nmay seem ugly and unliveable, but it\nis a considerable step forward.\nTo find out more, visit:\nwww.zedfactory.com and\nwww.bioregional.com, or contact\nthe Imperial branch of EWB\nBedZED: a graveyard or a vision of fossil fuel-free future?\nA Beddington ecological utopia?\nJo\u00e3o Vitor Serra weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of UK\u2019s largest eco-village\nSisters are doin\u2019 it for themselves.\n\n"

Now\nafter \u201cexperiencing\u201d the Blue Men,\nmy prior description does seem\npathetically inadequate.\nFor the clueless, there are some\ndistinct features of the Blue Man\nGroup that really outstand them\nfrom any other ordinary perform-er. The most upfront, being their\nuncomfortably bald blueness. They\nhave an otherworldly appearance\nthat could scare a timid child into\ntears. There is a strange \u201cnakedness\u201d about the group that makes\n12\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 24 November 2005\nthem vulnerable and child-like.\nTheir faces are frozen straight but\nby no means blank.\nThe uniformity of their appearance meant that there are no \u201cfrills\u201d\nto distract the audience. They wear\nblack suits with funky contraptions\nthat spew out food/paint in the\ncourse of the show. Most impor-tantly, they do not speak and their\n\u201cact\u201d has no storyline.\nAlthough these enigmatic characters hardly emitted any squeaks, the\nenergy from their eyes and other\nbody movements gave them away\nentirely. They communicated with\nthe audience in a way that surpasses performers who actually speak.\nThe act saw the Blue Men playing\nwith ordinary objects and testing\nhow far one could get doing so. Sort\nof like a dare, with no boundaries.\nMost of it accompanied by great\nrhythmic music that got my friend\nand I bobbing our heads and tapping\nour feet. The music made uncannily\nby the crunch of Rice Krispies, a\ncolourful PVC-pipe-xylophone and\noil drums. Members of the audience\nwho were picked by the Blue Men\nto participate in their on-stage rou-tines, were gems themselves:\n20 minutes into the show, everything was suddenly stopped as\na man holding a camcorder gets\nupstage to film the arrival of some\nlatecomers. Accompanied by an\nopera singer\u2019s rendition of \u201cYou\u2019re\nLate\u201d and strong white spotlights\nwith much flare, this, I believe will\nput the embarrassed couple off\nbeing late for a while.\nA stern-looking man was pulled\ndown from the balcony to be painted\nblue. He was then smashed against\na white wall to form his print. He\nlooked miffed but much to the\namusement of the audience!\nI regret describing the Blue Man\nGroup as \u201cperformance art\u201d. It\ndoes deserve less of a classification.\nBeing in the audience was more of\nan experience. A reminder, if you\nlike, of how we should not forget how\nto play and connect with others, and\nexperience the joy of being alive.\nLing Ching Wong\nThe little Blue Men are coming to\nget you....\nNight has fallen over South\nKensington. A crash is heard in\nthe distance as someone stumbles\nblindly. A figure walks slowly with\na chair in his arms, trying to avoid\nobstacles as he crosses the room.\nWhispers of voices hide in the chatter of others. Even stranger, this\nis all going on in a room at the\ntop of the Union, where the cast\nare rehearsing for the upcoming\nplay, Peter Schaffer\u2019s Black Comedy\n(directed by Brooke Milburn), which\nwill open on the 30th of November as\nhalf of a double bill with Joe Orton\u2019s\nRuffian on the Stair (directed by\nNeil Monteiro).\nThe first play, Black Comedy, is\nabout an sculptor facing a highly nerve-wracking evening with\na potential buyer and his future\nfather-in- law. Typically for such an\nimportant occasion, his power goes\nout before his guests even arrive,\nand the rest of the evening just goes\ndownhill from there.\nAfter the interval, the audience\nreturns to find a magic wand has\nbeen waved over the stage, and we\nare sent to the other side of theatre\nfor Ruffian on the Stair, a dark drama\nabout a hit man and his live-in girl-friend, who is blissfully unaware of\nhis occupation. One day, a strange\nman shows up on their doorstep\nwhile the boyfriend is meeting a man\nin the King\u2019s Cross toilets. Though\nhe seems to be merely harassing\nthe woman, we gradually learn that\nthere is more to the story.

It is a very intimate space and\nmust be challenging for the actors,\nwho are only metres away from the\naudience, as this allows every facial\nexpression and movement to be\nscrutinised.\nHowever, all five characters are\nplayed superbly by actors who are\nrecognisable from television roles\nincluding parts in Black Books,\nSpooks, Dr Who, Casualty and Silent\nWitness. The proximity to the drama\nmakes it more interesting to watch\nas you can see spit fly, veins bulge\nand detail that you would miss in\nmost other theatres.\nThe plot is about Donald Jackson,\na scientist working on a space-based missile system for America\u2019s\ndefence programme. However, he\nloses support for his research and\ntransfers his work to an enemy state\nreferred to in discussions only by\ncoded initials.

There are\nparts of the play that flash back to\nprevious events with conflicting versions of the truth being revealed.\nThis switch between the past and\npresent is carried out very smoothly\nand the plot is easy to follow.\nThe way the stage is set up with\nthe audience surrounding it is an\noriginal idea and it is fun to be\nable to watch how everybody else\nis reacting to the play. It was also\ninteresting sitting next to a group\nof Americans on the way home who\nhad also just seen it. According to\nthem it was \u2018preachy\u2019 and \u2018too political.\u2019 I disagree, but go and see for\nyourself.\nHelene Myrvang\neach other (and us) what they know,\nor at least what they are willing to\ntell, about the events leading up to\nJackson\u2019s assassination.\nThe playwright Jason Sherman\nwas inspired by the real life murder\nof the Canadian weapons scientist\nGerald Bull, a man who felt betrayed\nby his own and the American government when his work was no longer\ngiven support. As a result, he started to conduct international arms\ndeals with countries that led the US\ngovernment to become increasingly\nworried. He was warned to stop his\ninvolvement several times, but was\neventually assassinated, shot three\ntimes in the back, twice in the head.\nNo one has ever been arrested for\nhis murder. All this is relevant in the\npresent climate. Words that spring\nto mind are Iraq, WMD, scapegoat\nand distortion of truth.\nTheatre\nCoram Boy\nThe National Theatre\nUntil 4 February 2006\nTickets \u00a310-36\nStudent Standby \u00a310\nThe National certainly doesn\u2019t seem\nto be going for ease in its Christmas\nfamily entertainment. Last year\nit was the phenomenal His Dark\nMaterials and this year it is Jamila\nGavin\u2019s Whitbread Award winning\nnovel Coram Boy. I was a little\napprehensive as to what the result\nwould be; adaptations of children\u2019s\nbooks can so often be sentimen-talised. I really didn\u2019t need to have\nworried.\nHelen Edmundson\u2019s masterly\nadaptation is very faithful to Jamila\nGavin\u2019s novel and is not at all precious about the grittier aspects\nwhich give it so much of gothic\nbeauty.\nThe story itself spans two generations and eight years and like the\nbook, has music as a central theme,\nparticularly Handel\u2019s Messiah which\nis played and sung with beautiful\neffect and style by the actors and a\nlive choir and orchestra at the back\nof the stage.\nPaul Ritter is deliciously slimy as\nthe utterly immoral villain of the\npiece, Otis Gardiner, a man who, in\ncahoots with Ruth Gemmell\u2019s coldly\ncalculating Mrs Lynch, makes his\nliving by collecting babies from desperate mothers who also give him\nmoney in the belief that he will take\nthem to be cared for at the Coram\nHospital in London, but instead buries them and pockets the money.\nJack Tarlton is no less mesmerising\nas the son that Otis abuses, not quite\nof this world, losing and discovering\nlove and life with such poignancy\nthat the stage feels almost lacking\nwhen he is not there.\nAnother brilliant innovation in this\nproduction is having the many boys\nplayed by actresses; an approach\nthat is so effective and utterly believ-able. Anna Madeley\u2019s performance\nas two boys, Alexander Ashbrook\nand his son Aaron, is sublime. She\nalso had the most startlingly perfect\nvoice that I have ever heard \u2013 quite\nan astonishing thing in a woman\nwho also has to scamper around\nstage, laugh and cry and then sing\nextremely exposed and challenging\nbaroque arias.\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 for\npeople who don\u2019t know the story\nalready it may be a little confusing at\ntimes, I felt that Mrs Lynch\u2019s morality lecture was slightly unnecessary\nand the Hallelujah Chorus was a little corny, but these are niggles and\nhighly debateable ones at that.\nIt was, very simply, one of the very\nbest experiences that I\u2019ve ever had\nin the theatre. So if you\u2019re planning\na family outing, an evening with a\nsignificant other \u2013 or have no excuse\nat all, apart from wanting one of the\nmost haunting and moving experiences in the theatre that you are\never likely to have \u2013 you could do a\nlot, lot worse than going to see this.\nLily Topham\nPhoto: Catherine Ashmore\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBioengineering\nVasudha Gudipati\n29\nfelix\nThursday 24 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nIt all started as the Bioengineering\nsociety organised a trip to the\nWindsor castle for the whole department on the 22nd of October. For\nthose of you who don\u2019t know Windsor\nCastle is an official residence of\nThe Queen and the largest occupied\ncastle in the world. A Royal home\nand fortress for over 900 years, the\nCastle remains a working palace\ntoday. Over a period of nearly 1,000\nyears it has been inhabited continu-ously, and altered and refurbished\nby successive monarchs. Some were\ngreat builders, strengthening the\nCastle against uprising and rebel-lion; others, living in more peaceful times, created a palatial Royal\nresidence.\nWilliam the Conqueror chose the\nsite, high above the river Thames\nand on the edge of a Saxon hunting\nground. It was a day\u2019s march from\nthe Tower of London and intended\nto guard the western approaches\nto the capital. The outer walls of\ntoday\u2019s structure are in the same\nposition as those of the original castle built by William the Conqueror\nin the 1070s. So too is the central\nmound supporting the Round Tower\nand the Upper Ward, where successive monarchs have had their\nprivate apartments since the fourteenth century.\nIn the 1170s Henry II rebuilt - in\nstone instead of wood - the Round\nTower, the outer walls of the Upper\nand most of the Lower Ward, and\nthe Royal apartments in the Upper\nWard. In the 1360s Edward III, who\nwas born at Windsor, extended the\nCastle. He created the immense St.\nGeorge\u2019s Hall for the use of the\nKnights of his newly founded Order\nof the Garter. Oliver Cromwell\ncaptured Windsor Castle after the\nBattle of Edgehill in 1642, and for\nthe rest of the Civil War it became a\nprison as well as the headquarters\nof the parliamentary forces. In 1648\nCharles I was held there before his\ntrial and execution in London.\nFollowing the Restoration, Charles\nIIwasdeterminedtomaketheCastle\nas splendid as possible. He created\na new set of State Apartments in the\n1670s, using the skills of the architect Hugh May, the artist Antonio\nVerrio for murals and ceiling paint-ings, and the famous wood-carver\nGrinling Gibbons. The King\u2019s Dining\nRoom and the Queen\u2019s Presence and\nAudience Chambers retain many of\nthese original features. Charles II\nalso laid out the 5km Long Walk\nleading due south from the Castle\ninto Windsor Great Park.\nGeorge IV was a great lover of art\nandfinedecoration.MuchofWindsor\nCastle\u2019s present appearance is due\nto the alterations he instigated in\nthe 1820s with his architect, Sir\nJeffry Wyatville. The buildings were\nrefashioned in the Gothic style, with\nthe addition of crenellations, turrets and towers. In the Upper Ward\nthe private apartments were moved\nfrom the north side of the quadrangle to the south and east side. The\nrooms on the north side were desig-nated, as now, as for use on formal\noccasions and State visits. One of\nGeorge IV\u2019s most remarkable additions was the Waterloo Chamber,\nwhich was created in the 1820s to\nshow portraits commissioned from\nSir Thomas Lawrence to commemorate the defeat of Napoleon at the\nbattle of Waterloo in 1815. They\nrepresent the monarchs, soldiers\nand statesmen who were involved\nin that defeat and its aftermath.\nThey include George III, George IV\nand the future William IV, the Duke\nof Wellington, Field Marshal von\nBl\u00fccher, the Emperors of Austria\nand Russia, the Kings of Prussia\nand France, and Pope Pius VII.\nThe twentieth-century history of\nthe Castle is dominated by the major\nfire that started on 20 November\n1992. It began in the Private Chapel,\nwhen a spotlight came into contact\nwith a curtain and ignited the mate-rial. It took 15 hours and one-and-a-half million gallons of water to put\nout the blaze. Nine principal rooms\nand over 100 other rooms over an\narea of 9,000 square metres were\ndamaged or destroyed by the fire,\napproximately one-fifth of the Castle\narea.\nThe next five years were spent\nrestoring Windsor Castle to its\nformer glory. It resulted in the\ngreatest historic building project to\nhave been undertaken in this country in the twentieth century, reviving\nmany traditional crafts.\nWindsor Castle may be 900 years\nold, but it continues to play a large\npart in the official work of The Queen\nand members of the Royal Family.\nToday The Queen uses the Castle\nboth as a private home, where she\nusually spends the weekend, and\nas a Royal residence at which she\nundertakes certain formal duties.\nThe traditional State Banquet is\nheld in St George\u2019s Hall (55.5m long\nand 9m wide), with a table seating\nup to 160 guests. This table was\nhumongous I tell you and it looked\nwell, \u201cmajestic\u201d.\nThe magnificent State Apartments\nare furnished with some of the finest works of art from the Royal\nCollection, including paintings by\nRembrandt, Rubens, Canaletto,\nGainsborough and the famous triple\nportrait of Charles I by Sir Anthony\nvan Dyck.\nIn the 1992 fire by good fortune the\nrooms worst affected were empty\nat the time, and as a result, few of\nthe Castle\u2019s artistic treasures were\ndestroyed. The highly acclaimed\nrestoration work, completed in 1997,\nis a testament to the extraordinary\nskills of some of the finest craftsmen\nin Europe.\nOnce we were done with the\ncastle we went down to the town\ncentre which reminded me a lot of\nStratford-upon-Avon (Shakespeare\u2019s\nbirthplace), it had a very traditional\nvillage atmosphere (although with\nall the high street shops). We sat by\nthe river Thames which was only\n10 minutes away by walk and reminisced on the enjoyable day we had.\nThe trip was certainly entertaining\nand the castle is well worth going to\nif you want to experience this island\nnation\u2019s history.\nA brush with royalty...\nJust a tad more attractive than our monstrosity in South Ken.\nFelix New Year\u2019s\nHonours 2006\nThe Queen does them.

Next\nweek, the Chaplaincy is providing\ntwo opportunities to help you create\nthat space.\n\u201crespond creatively\n\u2013 or simply respond by\nlighting a candle\u201d\nOn Monday we\u2019re holding an event\ncalled A Journey to Stillness. It\noffers you a chance to be still in the\nmiddle of a busy day. We start with a\nshort meditation so that people can\nlet go of the rushing around and anxieties of everyday life. You are then\ninvited to continue the meditation by\nwalking into a labyrinth, which represents a journey to stillness. The\nlabyrinth has just one path (unlike a\nmaze) and allows you to walk without having to decide which route\nto take. This act of walking can be\nvery calming, and for many people is\neasier than sitting still. People who\nhave used our labyrinth before have\nfound it very relaxing, and enjoyed\nhaving a structured time of quiet.\nLabyrinths arise at different times\nin history and in different cultures\nfrom around the world, so they are\nopen to anyone rather than being\nlinked to just one religious tradi-tion. A Journey to Stillness is in the\nUnion Dining Hall from 1.10 \u2013 1.45.\nFrom Tuesday to Friday between\n9.30am and 5.00pm, to tie in with\nMedsin\u2019s Positively Red events\nfor World Aids Week, we are holding Reflect & Respond: Why are\nyou wearing a red ribbon on World\nAids Day? This installation in the\nChaplaincy prayer room offers a\nrange of resources and activities, for\npeople of any faith or none, to reflect\non and respond to HIV and Aids.\nYou will be able to encounter voices\nof people affected by HIV through\nresources from the National AIDS\ntrust, and think about your own\nresponse to HIV and Aids and why\nyou wear a red ribbon. You can\nadd to our red ribbon paper chain\nas a sign of solidarity and to represent the diverse ways people are\naffected by HIV. You\u2019ll also be able\nto reflect on some of the challenges\nHIV presents us with and respond\ncreatively \u2013 or simply respond by\nlighting a candle. Reflect & Respond\npresents you with a variety of things\nto read, look at, think about and do,\nand you can engage with whichever\nones you choose to.\n\u201cHow do you find time\nand space to think?\u201d\nBoth events are free and there\u2019s\nno need to sign up in advance. If\nyou\u2019ve ever wished you could find a\nmoment of peace during your busy\nday at college, one of these events\ncould be a good place to start.

After spending what seemed an eternity finding\nthese (now no longer) home courts\nin some random area in Kensal\nGreen, and being quite tempted to\ngive up along the way and retire\nfor a drink in one of the Halloween\ndecorated pubs, we arrived to find\nsome admittedly cute, so of course\nnon-imperial, footballers. All is good\nuntil we realise there are no\u2026posts!\nYes a netball court with no netball posts \u2013 smart! By now Queen\nMary\u2019s were already making their\nway from Mile End \u2013 fair play long\nway to come for no match. So out\nof the kindness of our hearts, and\nseeing as we were all there anyway,\nwe decided to at least take them\nfor a drink \u2013 had quite an amusing\nsession playing a random fruit and\ntube-line game\u2026don\u2019t ask I have no\nidea. So anyway, when we asked to\nre-schedule the match they tell us\nthey can\u2019t because they don\u2019t have\nthe time\u2026but wait, they\u2019re happy to\nfit in a friendly\u2026!?!?!? Losers \u2013 they\nknew we\u2019d whoop their, not so trim,\narses! So we are now officially anti\nQueen Mary\u2019s!\nOk now I\u2019ve got that out of my\nsystem, our match against Kings\nwas a scrapped victory, but a victory\nall the same. It was an away match,\nso planning ahead; we arranged to\nmeet at South Ken station to make\nour way to Canada Water where\nkindly one of their team members\nwould pick us up, giving us enough\ntime to warm up and practise a few\nplays. However, as we\u2019re jinxed\nwith our travel, it took us twice the\ntime to get there due to the Jubilee\ndeciding to be gay (excuse my nonPC\u2019ness) and stop-starting along\nthe way. Reaching nearly half an\nhour late, we started almost straight\naway \u2013 with no centre bib.\nWe set off with great strength,\ntaking the lead and keeping majority of the possession. Even though\nwe were playing well, there were\nstill some basic errors being made,\nwhich Kings took well advantage of.\nThey pulled off a one goal difference\nin the first quarter, extending it to\ntwo by half time, and in the third\nquarter we were 14-9 down, but that\nwasn\u2019t about to put us off! The last\nquarter was our quarter \u2013 we dominated the court and made the game\nours!\nThe ref was quite blatantly against\nus from the start, with one of her\nfavourite calls being contact, even\nthough the player meant to be on\nCelina Rughani\nNetball\nImperial College 3rds 17\nKings College 3rds 16\nBoat Club\nMike Walsh\nCountry bumpkins\ntriumph!\nPlease send your sports reports,\nreviews and comments to\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThirsty for the win!\nthe receiving end of our \u2018foul play\u2019\nwas half way across the court, and\npoor Ashley was her favourite victim\n\u2013 but in her defence, she was quite\na big girl to try and get around.\nThe other being delayed play - that\nmeans our players weren\u2019t getting\nback fast enough for the centre passes \u2013 bull! As Anjali quite correctly\nput it, \u201cWe were literally sprinting\nback\u2026her big arse couldn\u2019t get back\nany faster!\u201d (I warned you I\u2019d be\nquoting).\nAfter a quick pep talk we came\nback on for the final quarter, all guns\nblazing, looking for no less than a\nwin. Taking the first 5 goals, which\nbrought us up to 14 all, the win was\nat our fingertips. The final quarter\nshowed true drive and determination of all the girls \u2013 Jade even went\nfor goal outside the D! After the fifth\ngoal, Kings managed to get their\nmitts on the ball and started scor-ing, the game went up to 16 all - all\nhearts stopped for the final minute,\nthere was no way we were settling\nfor a draw. Then, in the last few sec-onds, a fab-tastic goal \u2013 sneaking it\nin before Cruella could blow the final\nwhistle. What a high! Adrenaline\nrushing we got back in time for a\nquick drink at the union. Special\ncongratulations to Tombo for winning player of the match\u2026again.\nWell played girls \u2013 a deserving win,\nthey wanted it, but we wanted it\nmore!\nA score that would not look out of\nplace posted upon the pavilion at a\nlocal cricket ground ensured that\nWye\u2019s 100% unbeaten start to the\nseason remained intact. It became\napparent from kick-off that the game\ncould potentially become a \u2018walk in\nthe park,\u2019 and it did so with the men\nin blue initiating a high tempo passing game. With the bagging of of our\nfirst goal, we settled into a rhythm\nin which we began to express our\nrefreshing flowing brand of attacking football. This relaxation brought\nwith it an onslaught of shots, peppering a visibly quivering Rochester\ngoal.\n\u201c a good days work\nfrom every player\u201d\nMilton and Nick showed their pace\nout wide and provided excellent\ndelivery for our front pairing of Ian\nand Rich, whilst being backed up\nexcellently by full backs Lucas and\nKieron. A Formidable engine room\nmanned by Jack and Max ran the\nShow in the middle of the park, mirrored by Wye\u2019s best looking couple\nChris and Jamie sweeping up anything at the back. Wye\u2019s strength\nin depth was made all too clear\nwith the addition of Calder, Jay and\nMillsy at half time. Special mention\nto stand-in goalie JD, as with all the\naction in our box the crowd were\nconcerned had turned to stone!\nThe net was burst seven times\nin the first half before a reshuffled second half team improved on\nthis with eight scorchers! There\nwere plenty more goals in it with a\nnumber of spurned Wye opportunities but I suppose we should be\ncontent with 15!!\n\u201cA score that would\nnot look out of place\nposted upon the pavilion at a local cricket\nground\u201d\nAnother positive was the continued solidity at the back- wye are still\nyet to concede this season! All in all,\na good days work from every player\nas the lads continue to march on\nrelentlessly!!\nAdam Miller\nMens Football\nUCCA Rochester XI 0\nWye XI 15\nWhat can I say? A truly stunning\nmatch was played by the RSM\nLadies Hockey team last Wednesday\nagainst a very nasty Reading 4ths.\nWe set out from campus for the long\ndrive out to Reading with our usual\nnumber of 9 players, to be met by\nanother team of 14 with rolling subs.\nWhy do all our matches seem to be\nthe other team\u2019s tryouts? Anyway,\na quick warm-up in the freezing\ncold and we got underway. The first\nhalf was especially tricky for us as\nthey were fielding 11 players so 2\nmessy goals slipped past our keeper\nRachel. However we fought back\nwith an awesome play up the wing\nfrom Heather and a very neat goal\nfrom Lucy \u2013 our first of the season no less! Two minutes later, and\nagainst a very sloppy Reading, we\nwere even with another goal from\nour frontman Dasha. As play continued we managed to send one of\ntheir girls off with a neat stick-chin\ncontact from Charlotte, and some\nflying sticks from me, but to no avail\nand half time ended 4-2.\nSome words of encouragement\nfrom our two lovely cheerleaders\nin the form of Mike and Sam and\nwe were back out on an even pitch\nplaying 9-all. Everyone upped their\ngame in the second half and we\nbecame the dominant team, with\nAlice snatching many a possession from right under their noses.\nReading in their desperation turned\nto complaining to the umpires and\nrugby tackling our girls on the pitch,\neven managing to take out our lady-of-the-match Lucy. Some great\ndefending from Dawn and Charlotte\nkept out their lousy attempts at\nanother goal, and with Stacey and\nDasha up front we managed another stunning one taking the score to\n4-3 (even if it did go in off the goal-wheel and not the post!). Minutes\nlater the final whistle blew and it\nwas all over, but with such breathtaking play it won\u2019t be long until we\nare racing up the league! Massive\nthanks to everyone that played \u2013 a\ntruly inspiring match!\nA not so friendly\nfriendly!\nIt was a remarkably pleasant\nNovember morning, the sun was\nout and the water was flat. Even\nmore notable, though, was the\nsight of over 500 racing boats lining\nthe banks of the Thames between\nBrentford Dock and Chiswick Pier\n(that\u2019s almost 4 miles!) They were\nall waiting for one thing - the chance\nto race the \u2018Championship Course\u2019,\nfrom Mortlake to Putney in the\nFours Head of the River.\nAt just after 12:30, the horn sounded and they were off! The processional race was led away under\nChiswick Bridge by a quad scull\npacked with GB international row-ers, but the chase was on as the\nfollowing crews looked to make their\nmark on the race. The first IC crew\ndown was the \u2018Senior 2\u2019 quad of Ben\nSmith, Ed Johnson, Will Laughton\nand George Whittaker. This was the\ntop priority crew for the club, but the\nguys didn\u2019t appear to be feeling the\npressure as they came through the\nstart looking smooth and controlled.\nAnd so it went on, with boat after\nboat setting off to tackle the gruelling 20 minute course. Among them\nwere another 10 IC crews, including three from this year\u2019s promising\nwomen\u2019s\u2019 squad. Also in the mix, for\nthe eagle-eyed amongst us, was one\nJames Cracknell, who picked up an\noar again for the first time since last\nyear\u2019s Olympics as a last minute sub\nfor his club, Leander.\nEventually, after over 2 hours of\nracing, the last of the crews made it\nthrough the finish. From this point,\nall we could do was to wait for the\nresults to be worked out by the race\norganisers, and what better place to\nwait than the bar\u2026\nA few pints and a quick download from the race website later and\nwe had those all important results.\nInitially there was a bit of disappointment as it turned out that none\nof our crews had actually won their\nevents. However, there were some\ngood performances all round. The\nmen\u2019s quad came in 13th overall and\n4th in their category, seven seconds\nbehind the victors. Even closer still\nwas the top men\u2019s coxed four, who\nput together a strong race to finish\n2nd in the \u2018Senior 1\u2019 category, less\nthan 2 seconds adrift of the winners.\nFurther down the field, the 3 \u2018Senior\n2\u2019 coxless fours were 5th, 14th and\n15th, and the \u2018Senior 1\u2019 coxless four\nwas 9th. Also putting up a good\nfight was the top \u2018Senior 3\u2019 coxed\ncrew, who, despite having to carry\nConnie down the course with them,\nmanaged to beat one of the coxless\nfours and also finished a creditable\n3rd in their category, with the \u2018B\u2019\ncrew further back in 13th place. The\ngirls also came up with some useful\nresults - the top quad finished as the\n8th fastest women\u2019s\u2019 crew overall\n(5th in their category), with the 2nd\nquad not too far behind them (8th\nin the same category). Last but not\nleast was the girls\u2019 \u2018Senior 3\u2019 coxed\nfour, who fought their way through\nto 11th position in their category\ndespite having a 2 hour wait at the\nstart.\nWith the evening ahead of us, and\nwith many people already pretty far\ngone (alcohol is surprisingly quick\nto affect you after a period of intense\nphysical exertion!), the dance floor\nat our neighbours, Thames Rowing\nClub, began to draw the punters in.\nPredictably, a night of crazy, drunken \u2018dancing\u2019 and general debauchery ensued. There were of course\nsome less predictable occurrences,\nbut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go into them\nhere... (There\u2019s a time and a place,\nand neither of them involve this\nissue of Felix!)\nSo, all in all, a good start to the\nmain racing season. We definitely\nall need to put some work in over the\ncoming months, but now we know\nwhere we stand, and what we\u2019ve got\nto aim for...\nOn another note, I feel that a mention should be made of those boys\nand girls from the club who made\nthe trip to Boston (Lincs\u2019 not USA)\nfor the first GB international trials of\nthe year. Of particular note were the\nperformances of George, who came\nhome 4th in men\u2019s heavyweight,\nand new-boy Will, who pulled out an\nastounding 8th position in his first\nsenior level trials. We\u2019ll have to wait\nand see how the season unfolds, but\nthere\u2019s certainly promise there in\nterms of potential international representation - fingers crossed.\nLadies Hockey\nReading 4th XI 4\nRSM XI 3\nGilly Barber\nThe fours Head of the River\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nO\nn 10 October 2001 Diane\nPretty went to the High\nCourt in a plea for the\nright to terminate her\nlife. She was paralysed\nfrom the neck down, doubly incon-tinent, and in need of constant care.\nDespite overwhelming public sup-port, Pretty\u2019s request was denied,\nas was her later appeal to the House\nof Lords: the UK was not ready to\nlegalise assisted suicide. Having lost\na two-year legal battle, she was left\nto die in the way she least wanted:\ndistressed and in pain.\nToday, the march towards legali-sation has progressed considerably\nsince the Pretty case. Last July,\nthe British Medical Association\ndropped its long-held opposition to\nassisted dying in favour of a neutral\nstance. Proposals to allow doctors\nto help terminally ill people die were\nreintroduced in the House of Lords\nthis month and await discussion.\nThe Assisted Dying for the\nTerminally Bill was also the subject\nof a debate last week at a slightly\nmore academic venue \u2013 Imperial\nCollege. The event was organised\nby the Christian Medical Fellowship\nand the Imperial College Christian\nUnion. Two guest speakers tackled the arguments for and against\neuthanasia.\n\u201cIn my own clinical and personal\nlife I\u2019ve watched many people die,\nand I can think of several occasions\nwhere I was strongly tempted to\ngive lethal medication just to end it\nall. But I always held back from that\nfinal step, not least because there\nis a clear prohibition of the law on\nintentional killing, but also I have a\nprofound conviction that deliberate\nkilling is wrong. What is actually\nbeing proposed is a major change\nin the law on intentional killing and\non suicide. Let\u2019s not try to sani-tise the reality with compassionate\nwords,\u201d said Prof Wyatt, a professor\nof neonatal paediatrics at University\nCollege London and an expert on\nChristian medical ethics.\n\u201cWe recognize that life is a gift. It\nmay come from a Christian understanding that life is special, but most\npeople, even if they don\u2019t have a\nreligious faith, understand that life\nis special and recognise that we\nare a community, we belong to one\nanother, and therefore what you do\naffects me and vice versa. Assisting\nsuicide strikes at the heart of this\nunderstanding. It seems to me that\nsuicide is not a right to be assisted,\nit is a tragic sign of despair to be\nprevented.\u201d\nCurrently, assisted dying is legal\nin few places in the world. In the\nNetherlands, 1 in 40 deaths are\ndue to assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia. In the US, assisted\nsuicide is only permitted by law in\nthe state of Oregon, albeit under\na very strict set of a priori conditions from the patient. Since 1997,\n208 patients, most of them suffering\nfrom cancer, made use of the right to\nan assisted suicide. The US govern-Regarding the pain of others\nment is currently seeking to overturn the Oregon law in the Supreme\nCourt. However, if the law is found\nto be constitutional, many federal\nstates are hoping to follow Oregon\u2019s\nexample.\nOf all countries, Switzerland is by\nfar the most liberal with respect to\nassisted suicide, allowing it even\nwhen performed by non-physicians,\nthe only safeguard being that no\nselfish reasons are involved. It also\nallows foreign citizens to be assisted\nto commit suicide on Swiss territory,\na situation which has been commercialised to an extent by Dignitas, an\norganisation which provides assistance in suicide in exchange for a\nsmall fee. Reportedly, 20 Britons\nhave already used its services.\n\u201cI have the greatest respect\nfor palliative care, it does great\nthings for so many people. But\nthere are some patients whom\nwe are unable to help,\u201d said Dr\nMargaret Brainthwaithe, a barrister and former consultant physician and anaesthetist at the Royal\nBrompton Hospital and a member\nof the Voluntary Euthanasia Society.\n\u201cSome of them feel so strongly that\nthey starve and dehydrate themselves to death. Alternatively, they\ncan persuade their friends, their\nJo\u00e3o Medeiros reports from the Christian Medical Fellowship\u2019s debate on euthanasia\n4\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 24 November 2005\nrelatives or possibly their medical\npractitioners to act covertly and help\nthem to die in some discreet manner,\nhoping this will not come to the light\nof the authorities, so that there will\nbe no persecution, but recognizing\nthat that risk exists, and when they\ndie, they will not know if they nearest and dearest will subsequently be\ncharged. Finally, their other option\nis to take themselves off overseas\nand visit a commercial organisation\navailable in Switzerland where it is\npossible to purchase assistance in\ndying. We like to think of ourselves\nas a caring, affectionate, tolerant,\nmaybe even loving society, but what\nan indictment on a society with those values\nwhen our most troubled\ncitizens have to go overseas to seek the relief we\ncannot afford them.\u201d\nCan a religious perspective bring a valid\nperspective to the debate\non an increasingly secular society? \u201cMy biggest\nfear is for tolerance. I\ncan respect the view of\nthe Christian faith, but\nthey shouldn\u2019t impose\ntheir views on me anymore than I am imposing\nmy views on them. And that is the\nmessage that needs to go right up\nthe Christian hierarchy and not just\nthe Christian Medical Fellowship. I\nthink fanaticism, in any religion, is\ncounter productive to the benefit of\nsociety.\u201d\nCERN, the European Organisation\nfor Nuclear Research, is the\nworld\u2019s largest particle physics\ncentre where scientists explore\nwhat matter is made of and what\nthe forces that hold it together\nare. Thursday 1 December will\nbe a celebration of CERN\u2019s 50th\nbirthday, the 100th anniversary\nof Einstein\u2019s publication of the\nSpecial Theory of Relativity, and\nthe World Year of Physics. CERN\nwill celebrate by hosting a 12-hour\nwebcast about Einstein and the\nfuture of physics beyond Einstein.\nSo how is Imperial College related to this?

Five candidates were disqualified for illegal campaigning via\nmass spam e-mailing of students.\nEmma Persky was elected as the\nEqual Opportunities Officer, defeating her only opponent, Kareem\nOsman. Dan Lehmann and Christine\nItegbe were elected into the Trading\nand Retail Committee, with Dan\nelected again into the Services\nCommittee. Laura Parkinson, Alon\nOr-Bach and Laura Griffiths were\nelected as Imperial\u2019s ULU delegates.\nHowever, a number of elections are\nstill under dispute, and have yet\nto announce any results; namely\nthose for the Ordinary Members of\nCouncil, for which positions a record\nnumber of candidates stood.\nOn being elected as the Equal\nOpportunities Officer, Ms Persky\nwas glad. She told Felix, \u201cEqual\nopportunities is an area I feel particularly passionate about\u201d. The new\nofficer announced that she would be\nconcentrating on \u2018Woman\u2019s issues\u2019,\nsaying, \u201cI would like to see the\nuniversity putting more effort into\nencouraging young women into science and engineering\u201d.\nThe delays in the annouce-ment of the Union Council results\nstemmed from complaints regarding two mass e-mails sent to club\nmailing lists, where the recipients\ndid not know who the sender was.\nThe Union immediately started an\ninvestigation, which was hindered\nby several factors including the fact\nthat sent e-mails were blind copied\n(so it could not be seen who the\ne-mails were sent to), the sent emails were deleted from senders\u2019\nmail accounts, and the fact that the\nmailing list was split into 15 subsets,\nwith each e-mail sent to a different\npart of the list. \u201cIt was only through\nthe help of ICT and other electronic\ninfromation that we were able to Leader, page 19\nMatthew Hartfield\nPolitics Editor\npiece together what happened,\u201d\nsaid Sameena Misbahuddin, ICU\nPresident.\nAlthough the disqualified candidates did not send the offending\ne-mails, The Union Exceutive were\nunanimous in their decision that a\nserious breach of regulations had\noccurred with a deliberate attempt\nto hide the evidence. The Union\nbelieve the senders were instructed\nto send e-mails by the candidates,\nor the candidates were aware of\nthe senders campaigning for them.\nThe disqualified candidates claimed\nthat they were not aware that any\nrules had been breached, despite\nbeing given a \u2018candidate pack\u2019, that\nstated the rules regarding emails\nvery clearly, at the beginning of the\nelection.\n\u201cThe hold up has been frustrating\nfor all involved\u201d, Ms Misbahuddin\ntold Felix, she issued a warning to\nfuture candidates, \u201cThis shows that\nthe breaking of rules will not be\ntolerated; elections must be run and\nfought fairly, and any attempt to\nbreach the rules will be found out\u201d.\nObviously, some of those disqualified were not happy with the result.\nFelix spoke to Tanvirul Alam and\nHaji Hassam, who denied any wrong-doing. \u201cThe reason it appeared that\na mailing list was used is because\nour friends were e-mailed, and\nbeing our friends we naturally have\nthe same interests, which is why the\nrecipients were on the mailing list\u201d\nsaid Mr Hassam. When asked why\nthe recipients were blind carbon\ncopied, Hassam said that this was\nbecause it was sent to his friends,\nbut if a particular person decided\nto send a reply to the whole group,\nthen this would prevent people who\ndidn\u2019t know the replier from receiving an e-mail. He also claimed that\nthe e-mails were not saved becuase\n\u201cthey were sent from website email addresses, such as Yahoo or\nHotmail, which doesn\u2019t automatically save sent items\u201d. Unfortunatly\nhe didn\u2019t specify if these were personal adresses, or why he didn\u2019t\nuse Imperial\u2019s own e-mail system in\nthis case. Hassam and Alam were\nadament that they tried to keep to\nthe rules, with both claiming they\ndid not send out e-mails to their\nrespective societies (Alam is head\nof MathSoc; Hassam president of IC\nFinance) advertising the elections\nas they knew that such an act would\ndeliberatly swing votes their way.\nTanvirul appeared defensive, saying that \u201cMy friends who did this\nwere not on my campaign team \u2026\nI had no responsibility for what they\ndid\u201d. Both Hassam and Alam were\nalso critical of the investigation,\nwith Alam claiming that the Union\nExecutive had already \u201cmade up\nUnion elections shambles\nSome results annouced, candidates disquali\ufb01ed, appeals launced\nFive disqualified for spam emailing clubs and societies\nEastern Promise:\n20% o\ufb00 for all Imperial\nstudents at Tampopo\npage 18\nAs the demolition of the much loved Southside building\ncontinues (top) a new bar opens in Linstead.

Mestre trains three\ntimes a day at his academy in Miami,\nand also travels to all other academies throughout the world giving these Batizados, allowing each\nCapoeirista to train with the best\nCapoeirista in Aboli\u00e7\u00e3o. Amazingly,\nhe was awarded his black belt at just\n20 years of age.\nSome members of IC Capoeira\ntook part in the main event, learn-sport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSalve! Most of you might not have\nheard about the Afro-Brazilian martial art of Capoeira, so you probably\ndon\u2019t know that we have our own\nCapoeira Society here at Imperial.\nWell, allow me to explain\u2026\nIt all began in the \u2018slave-trade\u2019\nin the 16th Century; people were\nkidnapped from Africa and sold as\nslaves in Brazil. Those captured\ndevised a plan to free themselves\nfrom the shackles of slavery \u2013 they\nweren\u2019t permitted to train in any\nfighting arts or skills, so created a\nnew martial art disguised as a dance.\nThis is how Capoeira was born. In\nthe game, Capoeiristas gather in\na circle (roda) with various instruments at the head of the roda playing tribal music. The Capoeiristas\nclap and sing to the music, whilst\ntwo people play Capoeira to the\nrhythm in the centre of the roda.\nIt has always been played in the\nstreets and on the beaches of Brazil,\nbut now has reached every corner\nof the planet.\nCapoeira is a martial art full of fluid\nand dynamic movements of attack\nand counter-attack, with some awesome acrobatics thrown into the mix\ntoo. The finished display is a beautiful blend of music, singing, dance,\nattack/counter-attack and the traditions of those who created Capoeira.\nIt is quite simply a martial art unlike\nanything you will have ever seen\nbefore.\nOur society is affiliated to Capoeira\nAboli\u00e7\u00e3o, a group of Capoeiristas\nDom Thorrington\nCapoeira\ning valuable new skills from Mestre\nand earning their first cordas (corda\nverde), with one earning his second\ncorda (corda amarelo). For the other\nmembers not in the Batizado, Mestre\narranged a special class so that they\ndidn\u2019t miss out on this amazing opportunity to train with him.\nMestre Delei, like all Masters of\nany martial art, insists on absolute\nperfection in practicing our martial\nart, as well as complete dedication to\nthe group and to Capoeira generally.\nIt was the most exhausting lesson\nwe have ever had in college, but well\nworth the aching muscles the next\nday.\nA normal lesson consists of learning various moves and techniques\nQuick Crossword by Fishface\nBatizado for Capoeira Aboli\u00e7\u00e3o\n32\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 24 November 2005\nto attack or counter-attack your\nopponent, but the art of Capoeira\nis only really seen the roda, and\nat the end of this special lesson\nMestre Delei invited us to create a\nroda with him. Some of the group\nhad only been playing Capoeira\nfor one month, so the opportunity\nto play against him was unbeliev-able! He tested our skills, knowing some had only played for one\nmonth, and gave everyone a taste\nof true Capoeira played by someone who has devoted their life to\nCapoeira Aboli\u00e7\u00e3o. For those who\nwere looking to earn their first\ncorda, he tested them a bit more,\ntrying to see if they were worthy of\nthe corda verde.\nFor the rest of the Batizado, the\ngroup had longer training sessions\nwith Mestre (some running for over\nthree hours) with some music and\nsinging lessons thrown in to complete the training. A Capoeirista\nnot only needs to be skilled in\nacrobatic and fluid movements, but\nmust also be capable of playing the\nvarious instruments used in the\nroda \u2013 the atabaque (floor-stand-ing drum), pandeiro (tambourine)\nand the berimbau (like a long bow\nwith a wooden bowl at one end\n\u2013 the music is played by hitting\nthe string and changing the pitch\nwith a stone), as well as knowing\nthe songs and different rhythms of\nthe game.\nIf you would like to know more\nabout Capoeira, why not come\nand try a class?

It\u2019s easy enough to\nsee why the story itself has been so\npopular - it is brilliantly imaginative\n\u2013 indeed, it would be hard to imagine\nanyone else who could invent a situation where everybody is both the\ndetective and a suspect, make the\nchild\u2019s nursery rhyme \u2018Ten Little\nSoldier Boys\u2019 have such grisly importance and create a body count more\nTheatre\nAnd Then There Were None\nGielgud Theatre\nTickets \u00a312.50-\u00a340\nStandby \u00a317.50 (available 1 hour\nprior to the show)\nimpressive than Shakespeare\u2019s.\nThe story itself starts off innocently enough with some guests\nmaking polite conversation over\ndinner as they wait for their delayed\nhost. However, it rapidly transpires\nthat they have been lured to dinner on a deserted island for far\nmore sinister purposes as one by\none they gradually start encountering fatal \u2018accidents\u2019 as the ten\nsoldiers on the mantelpiece also disappear \u2013 prompting revelations of\ndark secrets, and some of the most\nsatisfyingly terrifying theatre I have\never seen. Part of the thrill for the\naudience is wondering how Christie\nwill fulfil the prophetic role of the\nTen Little Soldier Boy rhyme \u2013 and I\nchallenge anyone who doesn\u2019t know\nthe story at all to figure out \u2018A red\nherring swallowed one\u2019 accurately.\n(By the way, please don\u2019t send in letters to next week\u2019s edition abusing\nmy mental ability if you do!)\nThis is a production that is completely engrossing (a new version\nby Kevin Elyot which remains very\nfaithful to the book) not sugar-coat-ing any of nastier elements to the\nstory. It is a little slow to start\noff with, including some very non-funny \u2018silly\u2019 dancing by Sam Crane\nand Tara Fitzgerald. However, the\nevening immediately livens up after\nthe classic \u2018disembodied voice\u2019\nspeaks, accusing all the assembled\nof murders, followed rapidly by the\nfirst, highly spectacular departure\nof one of the accused.\nAfter this, the revelations and\nrespective changes from people into\nex-people come thick and fast, along\nwith ever-increasing amounts of\ntension. This tension was provided\nin no small part by Gregory Clarke\u2019s\nbrilliant sound effects, including a\ntruly terrifying hornet sound as well\nas all the classics of a murder mys-tery, thunder, gunshots and some\nvery effective screaming. This combined with lighting that plays on all\nour childhood fears of shadows and\nthe dark, and follows the excellent\nrule that \u2018it\u2019s not what you see but\nwhat you think you\u2019ll see that scares\nyou most,\u2019 as well as some highly\ndramatic special effects manage to\ncrank up the tension so much that\nyou feel almost as terrified as the\ncharacters themselves.\nAs for the acting, well it was all\npretty excellent too really, though\nI felt that Gemma Jones (as spinster Emily Brent) could have given\nher character much more terrifying coldness rather than playing up\nthe doddery-old-lady effect quite so\nmuch, and Sam Crane was a little too shrilly hyperactive as idiotic\nrich-boy Anthony Marston.\nThe main acting credits go to John\nRamm as the unfortunate butler\nproviding most of the humour, and\nTara Fitzgerald as Vera Claythorne\n\u2013 sexy, intense and perfectly conveying her transformation from a confident modern young woman of the\n1930s to a terrified creature, more\nthan slightly derailed by events, and\nable to\u2026well, I won\u2019t give away the\nending.\nLily Topham\n\u201cThe child\u2019s nursery\nrhyme takes on a grisly\nnew importance.\u201d\nThe Winner: Girl with Baby - Poland by Shara Henderson\nPhotos at the NPG\nThe Schweppes Photographic\nPortrait Prize is the predecessor of\nthe \u2018John Kobal\u2019 award which is one\nof photography\u2019s most distinguished\ncompetitions. It definitely follows in\nthose fantastic footsteps with sixty\nbrilliant and totally different interpretations of the theme \u2018Portrait.\u2019\nThe pieces on display have been\nselected from six thousand works\nwhich were submitted, and are by\nphotographers which come from\nvariety of different backgrounds,\nincluding both professionals and\nstudents, and even amateurs.\nFor the third year running, this\nexhibition is bringing in crowds of\npeople, as aside from housing the\nwork of new and talented photog-raphers, it is absolutely free. This\nquality, when combined with the fact\nthat the exhibition includes portraits\nranging from the mildly disturbing\nPhotography\nThe Schweppes Photographic\nPortraiture Prize\nNational Portrait Gallery\nTickets \u00a312.50-\u00a340\nUntil\nto the arguably erotic, makes the\nexhibition very appealing indeed!\nPieces aim to challenge our perceptions and are not just superficial portraits. The photo of \u2018Anabel\nand Vikki\u2019 depicts two unattractive,\nbutch, punk lesbians. The women\nare standing close together with\nthe more masculine figure grabbing lustily at the breasts of the\nother. This piece really questions\nthe glamorous modern day image\nof lesbians.\nOnestrikingportraitwas\u2018Rebecca\u2019\nby Shane Degan. His subject\u2019s hair\nis wild and tangled and is strewn\nagainst her cheek joining her eyebrow in a long dark curve. She is set\nagainst white and pink Laveteria\nflowers; their branches twist and\nturn. Her skin tones mimic the colours of the flowers, and her wild\nhair follows the movement of the\nbranches. In her suburban settings\nshe is shown with as much beauty\nand freedom as Laveteria flowers.\nThe winning photograph was \u2018Girl\nWith a Baby\u2019 by Shara Henderson, it\nwas taken on a photo shoot of local\nchildren in the Polish industrial town\nof Brzeg Dolny. The portrait shows a\nbarefooted girl of about 6years old\nholding a baby of about her size. The\nartist states her aim when taking\nphotos as to \u2018show a side that people\ndo not see or happen to overlook.\u2019\nDespite the winning photo being\nvery effective, my favourite was\n\u2018Amy and Jack\u2019 by fourth prize winner Magnus Reed. It shows Jack\nout of focus in the foreground whose\nbody divides the photograph in half.\nBehind him stands Amy who is\nclearly in focus, she stares at him\ntentatively, with bracelets dangling\ngently from her wrists and her hands\nplaced in the pockets of her jeans.By\ndividing the photograph into two\nhalves, Reed is putting emphasis on\neach person having an equal part of\nthe interaction. The photographer\nremarks, \u2018Amy and Jack had never\nmet but they soon started interact-ing. I wanted to remind people what\nit was like to be 12/13, to view things\nas they really are.\u2019\nThoughtful comments on society\nand culture, a bit of humour and\nquite simply beautiful photography\nmake this exhibition very enjoyable.\nI would recommend this to every-one.\nNatasha Ehsanullah\n\n"

For girls,\nthink Ivana Trump, but tone it down\njust a little! For boys however, this\nlook is slightly modified and called\nthe Military look. You\u2019ve probably\nseen Pete Doherty wearing a jackets and hats that look like he\u2019s come\nstraight out of the Crimea. Many\nhave mixed views on this man, but\nhis style epitomises what this look is\nall about. Very cool.\nThe world of fashion has brought\nout its Spring/Summer collections\nalready. Already?! You\u2019ve only\njust sorted out winter look, but if\nyou want to make the most of the\nJanuary sales then look at the new\ncollections to find out what\u2019s hot and\nwhat\u2019s not in 2006.\nThe general theme of the new collections is the Italian Rivera; linen\njackets and white shirts for boys and\nfloral dresses for girls. Lovely, you\nmight think, but sometimes major\nfashion houses can do bizarre things\nwith nice ideas. I think the designers at Christian Lacriox have been\nwatching too many old movies as the\nmodels in their new collection look\nvery much like extras from Summer\nHoliday (ah, Cliff will be pleased).\nLouis Vuitton has mixed schoolboy\nwith Italian businessman, resulting\nin a confused look. The shorts, with\nshirt and tie look is interesting, but\nmaybe a little \u201cout there\u201d for my\ntaste! Alexander McQueen has kept\nhis collection surprisingly simple\nwith modest, light shirts and trousers building most of the new look.\nHis models looked beautiful in their\nwhite and biscuit outfits with tanned\nskin, who knows, maybe the Italian\nlook will payoff after all?\nThe looks, the spring and the wardrobe\nfashion fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWinter wonders to warm cold nights, interesting new collections and Kate Thornton\nDolly Delaney\nFashion editor\n19\nfelix\nThursday 24 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nMany styles are around this season.\nSo to make the most of that ever-decreasing overdraft I will help you\nmake sure you find the look that\nsuits you best.\nHave you looked at shop window\ndisplays recently? Urban Outfitters,\nMonsoon, Kookai and countless others have gone for black displays.\nBlack is definitely back this sea-son, so don\u2019t be afraid to darken up\nthis winter, with lace shedding its\ngothic guise and re-emerging as an\nenchantingly romantic option, the\nBlack Widow has never been more\nsexy.\nBlack seems to be the order of\nthe day with such styles such as\nthe Houndstooth and Monochrome\nlooks. Be careful not to overdo\nthe Houndstooth. Generally this\npattern is best on either coats or\nskirts. In my first page as fashion editor I mentioned the Beatnik\nlook, inspired by Edie Sedgwick.\nThe monochrome look incorporates\nBeatnik, but you can also hark back\nto the eighties Two Tone movement-just make sure it\u2019s black!\nFashion often likes to mimic the\nanimal kingdom. This winter several textures have made this idea\nbig again- velvet, fur, sheepskin\nand feathers. If you haven\u2019t bought\nyour winter coat yet, sheepskin and\nfur will keep you toasty and warm.\nHowever I fail to see its appeal,\nas many coats on the high street\nwill use synthetic fabrics to create\nthese (the use of fur is not only high\nstreet taboo, but totally immoral).\nSo, if you want opulent winter\nchic, turn to velvet. At the premiere\nof \u201cHarry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire\u201d, Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint\nand Robert Pattinson (who plays\nthe luscious Cedric Diggory) wore\nvelvet jackets. Although they all\nlooked dashing on the red carpet, it\nwas Pattinson who looked the best.\nThe trick to wearing velvet well is to\nhave it only on the collar and cuffs\nof a jacket if you\u2019re going to wear\nmore than one item that contains\nthe material. Radcliff wore a green\nvelvet jacket and waistcoat with\ngreen trousers, whereas Pattinson\nwore only a black velvet jacket with\nwhite shirt and jeans.\nFor those ladies who have various balls and dinners to go to,\nhow about adding some black or\nwhite feathers to a strapless dress?\nPlumes exude bird-of-paradise\nflamboyance and give classic styles\na glamorous touch.\n\u201cthe Black\nWidow has never\nbeen more sexy\u201d\nThink you\u2019re\nfabulous?\nDo you think you\u2019re\nfashionable? Send me a\npicture with you name and\ndepartment. If I agree then\nyour picture could be in the\nnext issue of Felix!\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBeauty\n\u201cyou want to\nmake the most\nof the January\nSales\u201d This winter\u2019s fabric seems to be\nvelvet and silk. So if you\u2019re going\nto go all out on winter chic, make\nsure that your make-up is just\nas opulent. Metallic eye shadow\nand cheek highlighter will add\nthat frosty look to any outfit.\nBenefit have a wonderful range\nof body and face metal cream, in\nvarious shades of gold to match\nall skin colours. They also have\nsome gorgeous eyeliner pens,\nmy favourite being \u201cgilded\u201d (see\nabove). But if you\u2019re an indie\ngirl and prefer the Beatnik look,\nmake sure that you have the\nperfected the look of wide-eyed\ninnocence. Although some of\nyou may not have mastered the\nart of applying eyeliner to your\nupper eyelids, this is something\nthat is worth investing a little\ntime in doing. Eyeliner on the\nupper eyelids makes even those\nwith thin lashes look luscious\nand thick! However, if you simply cannot get the art right and\nend up looking like a panda, fear\nnot - false eyelashes are here! I\ntend to steer clear of the blasted things as a dear friend once\nmelted hers while opening the\noven door. In last week\u2019s X Factor\nKate Thornton oozed fifties sex\nappeal with her black bolero and\nred corset. But what really made\nher stand out was of course her\nred lipstick! I have it on good\nauthority that she is every bit as\nbeautiful in real life as she is on\nthe show. So for the Hourglass\nlook of high maintenance secre-tary, make sure that while wearing your pencil skirt that you can\nonly shuffle in, those fishnet tights\nthat keep snagging on table\ncorners and\nstiletto heels\nthat are simply impossible,\nyou also wear\nred lipstick.\nThis timeless\nclassic should\nof course be\nbought from\nthe empire\nthat personifies chic, Coco\nChanel.\nLouis Vuitton\u2019s Spring/Summer\nCollection: Don\u2019t worry, if all\nelse fails the timeless classic of\nsandals and socks will do.\nVelvet Dress by Giles\nDeacon: The Harry Potter\nboys donned matching\nvelvet jackets at the films\nrecent premiere, but maybe\nexcess isn\u2019t really magic.\nRoberto Cavalli:\nThe Event Dress, dress to\nimpress at the Christmas\nBall\nFloral prints from Christian\nLacriox\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA dressing down for Sir Richard\nTwo weeks have gone by since\nFelix (1334) first reported the draconian dress regulations annouced\nby Imperial\u2019s Management Board\nstating that all students must wear\ntheir identity cards whilst on college\nproperty and abide by a stringent\ndress code. The annoucement has\nbeen causing quite a stir both within\nCollege and wider education com-munity, the issue features in yesterday\u2019s Guardian.\nIf a cursory glance around the\nfoyer of the Sherfield building is\nanything to go by, it appears that\nthe stern security measures have\nfallen upon deaf ears. Curious as\nto whether instructing over 10,000\nstudents to wear a red band with\ntheir credentials around their neck\nwould have any constructive effect\nwhatsoever, Felix went straight to\nthe Rector himself.\nArmed with the benefit of hind-sight, Felix spoke to Sir Richard\nand the Chief Security Officer for\nOperations, Mr Branch, to find out\nwhat exactly is going on and why\npeople were taking more notice of\nthe neighbouring Natural History\nMuseum Ice Rink than they were of\n\u2018immediate\u2019 college policy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of being sensible and\nso this is an overreaction to what\nshould be a mature debate,\u201d says\nChris Miles\n3\nfelix\nThursday 24 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\u2019s front page is \u201can overreac-tion, to what should be a mature\ndebate\u201d Sir Richard Sykes\nBioenineering students refused to\nattend lectures in their noisy lecturer theatre on Friday 11 November.\nInstead they held a protest in the\nMechanical Engineering Foyer. The\nlecturer theatre in question is located in the heart of ongoing construction work in the Bessemer building,\nand has been plagued by disruption\nsince the start of term.\nConcentrating in lectures can be\ndifficult enough! But the rumble of\nfloor shaking pneumatic drills often\nmade it near impossible, leading\nto the spontaneous cancellation of\nnumerous classes. At the end of\nOctober a petition signed by over 140\nstudents was passed to Prof. Richard\nKitney, Dean of Engineering, stating\nthat the students found their learning conditions unacceptable.\nProf. John Lever, Head of the\nDeptartment of Bioengineering, had\nbeen assured at the beginning of\nterm that by use of new, advanced\nmachinery, building noise would be\nminimal. He then attempted to solve\nthe problem by informing the building works manager of the 2nd year\ntimetable and instructing him that\nno work should take place during\nlecture slots. However, the noise\ncontinued regardless, making it\napparent that the only reliable solution would be to find replacement\nlecture theatres.\nTo address the growing frustrations of students, City and Guilds\nCollege Union (CGCU) President\nSiddharth Singh raised the issue\nin a meeting with Prof. Julia King,\nHead of the Faculty of Engineering.\nIn feedback from the meeting\nSiddharth Singh said, \u201cSomeone\nshould be talking to BioEngineering\nand other departments about moving lectures to another lecture thea-tre. In any case, Prof. King is also\nthe champion of this long awaited\nproject so she is keen that it is over\nASAP\n. I can\u2019t stress enough that this\nis a short-term problem which will\nsolve BioEng\u2019s long term wows.\u201d\nThe response suggested that since\nBioengineering students would be\none of the main beneficiaries of the\nnew building in the long term they\nshould put up with the noise for the\nshort term. However, this seems\nto be unfeasible considering that\nthe building works are planned to\ncontinue well into next year and will\neventually involve the demolition of\nthe main entrance to the lecture\ntheatre.\nInthedaysleadinguptotheprotest\nMr Singh urged students not to get\n\u201ctoo excited about the issue\u201d. Some\nstudents regarded this statement\nas \u201cpatronising\u2026 and illustrative\nof the resounding apathy that confronted students since they raised\nthis complaint in the first weeks of\nterm\u201d. Indeed Singh\u2019s claim that\nany strike or room boycott would be\nof no help to anyone only served to\nmake the students more determined\nto show that they considered their\nstudying environment simply unacceptable in an academic institution\nas renowned as Imperial College.\nAlthough many would expect the\nCGCU to be the one of the primary\nbodies to support such actions students were instead left high and dry\nby the Union. The protest appeared\nto bring instant results, with a lecturer finding a quiet lecture theatre\nin the Deptartment of Aeronautical\nEngineering where the students\nhad the remaining day\u2019s classes. In\nan apparent shift of position Singh\nlater e-mailed the class to \u201capplaud\nEvan Morgan\nBioEng Students Protest over noise\nthe protest action\u201d.\nSpeaking to Felix last week, Prof.\nKing said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware there\nwas a protest. If I had known I\nwould have acted sooner - students\ndeserve an apology as they\u2019ve had a\nrotten time\u201d. She added, \u201cwe need to\nlook at the processes to ensure this\ndoesn\u2019t happen again\u201d but then went\non to say, \u201cthere\u2019s no guarantee with\nbuilding works, I would like to say it\nwouldn\u2019t happen again, but can\u2019t\u201d.\nAs of last week the second year\nstudents will no longer be returning to the Bessemer Building. They\nwill, however, be getting a little bit\nmore exercise between lectures.\nTheir classes have been relocated\nto available rooms in the Tanaka\nBusiness School, Royal School of\nMines, Mechanical Engineering\nBuilding, Huxley Building and ACE\nRoderick Hill (Prince Consort Rd.).\nProf King implied that Imperial students are lucky \u201cthey don\u2019t have to\ncycle between lectures like I had to\nat Cambridge\u201d.\nDespite the fact that plans to move\nlectures to these venues had been\nmade before the protest took place,\nthe students still voted unanimously\nin a meeting with year reps that they\nshould voice their resentment at\nhaving had to put up with \u201cdeplorable conditions\u201d for six weeks.\nUnfortunately this hasn\u2019t been\nthe first of their troubles either.\nThe Undergraduate course in\nBioengineering is one of the smallest\nat Imperial with an expected annual\nintake of only 50 students. Last year\nstudents saw their medical science\npracticals cancelled almost entirely\n(due to unavailability of laboratory\nspace) and their computer room cut\ndown to a third of its original size.\nThis was all due to a lack of facili-ties, which raises the question: is\nit right to run a course which does\nnot have the essential institutional\nsupport to allow it to live up to the\nstandards expected from a world\nclass University?\nFor more information and to listen\nto a sound clip visit www.cgcu.\nnet/bioeng\nStudents protesting at Imperial - Whatever next?\nlege\u2019s press officer, Sir Richard con-tinues, \u201cIt\u2019s not a black and white\nsituation, it\u2019s not a change from\ntoday until tomorrow, it\u2019s just about\nbeing sensible and realistic because\nif you see someone in the building,\nnot out on the road, and they look a\nbit odd and you see they\u2019re wearing\na badge, you don\u2019t take any notice.\nIf they\u2019re not wearing a badge you\nthink \u201coh that\u2019s a bit strange\u201d and\nif something went wrong and we\ndidn\u2019t have a system whereby people carried identification, then we\u2019d\nseriously be in trouble. If you go into\nthe city today you can\u2019t get into a\nbuilding without identification. You\nknow, fine, we all want to be free and\nnot have to do this but unfortunately\nthis is the will of the world today.\nWe would expect people just to be\nmature and sensible about this.\u201d\nWe took these statements to Terry\nBranch, Chief Security Officer, to\nfind out how strong the College\u2019s\nsentiments were being conveyed to\nthe Security team. Responding to\nthe perceived lack of compliance\namongst the students, he says\n\u201caround 50% are wearing their cards\naround campus at the moment, this\nwill gradually improve once students\nget used to it\u201d, however accepts that\nthere will never be 100% compliance.\nAddressing the concerns echoed by\nmany readers, Mr. Branch tells Felix\nthat no student shall be thrown off\ncollege property if they forget their\ncard, providing their identity can be\nverified by other means. Students\nwho outright refuse to display cards,\nhowever, will be dealt with on an\nindividual basis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any college ruling; there\u2019s\ngoing to be a gradual transition. If\nsomeone says \u2018I am not wearing my\ncard\u2019, I shall treat every instance\ndifferently, on its own merits. From\na security point of view it\u2019s a very\nefficient policy, especially considering the recent thefts from campus\nwhere people are able to stroll off\nthe street during the day and enter\ncollege buildings\u201d\nAs far as offensive dress is con-cerned, \u201cYou need to have some sort\nof guideline; It\u2019s just officially been\nput in writing. If someone complains to us that they find something\noffensive, we shall use our common sense and if necessary discuss\namongst ourselves to judge whether\ncollege intervention is appropriate\u201d.\nYesterday, a Security Officer told\nFelix: \u201cWe had an intruder enter\nBeit Hall on Sunday morning. We\nchecked camera recordings but\ncould not identify him, or print a\nphoto, because he was wearing a\nhoodie. One could say this was common sense, in this cold weather,\nyet it prevents us being an effective security service.\u201d. Hoodies, it\nseems, are not banned providing\nthey aren\u2019t used to cover the face.\nAsked whether they were welcome\non college property, considering\nthe sale of Imperial College hooded\nclothing at the Union shop, he replies\n\u201cThey\u2019re not banned to my knowl-edge, no\u201d. Common sense seems\nto be a recurring theme although\nthe interpretation of such is very\nmuch still up for debate.

    "content": "Johnny Depp\u2019s back, back again\nThis winter, we\u2019ll be having another dose of him in The Libertine\nThe Libertine\nDirector: Laurence Dunmore\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Samantha Morton and Rosamund Pike.\nLength: 114 minutes\nCertificate:18\nReleased:18 Novermber 2005\nHHHII\nW\ne\u2019ve seen him play\nthe curiously facial-hair lacking Mr Willy\nWonka in Charlie\nand The Chocolate\nFactory, this time round, in a movie\nJohnny Depp claimed to be close to\nhis own personal history, he is the\nmorally corrupted womanizer the\nEarl of Rochester.\nSet against the shocking and sensual backdrop of the Restoration,\nThe Libertine follows the story of\nJohn Wilmot, the second earl of\nRochester. He is the libertine of the\ngeneration: rebellious, scandalous\nwithout a regard for any social taboo\nor restriction. Strangely enough, he\nis very much revered for his eccen-tricity. So King Charles II asks for\nhis help to boost the royal highness\u2019\npopularity among his loyal subjects.\nHowever, the earl is tired of his\nlibertine status. From a wine bot-tle, he seeks solace from the persistent dullness and emptiness that\nhas confined him all his life. He\nmeets Elizabeth Barry (Samantha\nMorton), a plain but fiery actress\nwannabe. He makes her his prot\u00e9g\u00e9\ndespite his friends\u2019 many protesta-tions. As a result, his social status\nfalls from the sky to the murky pits\nas she rises to become England\u2019s\nbiggest star in the theatrical world.\nIn his alcoholic daze, he writes a\nplay of dildoes and of kings who can\u2019t\nget it up. He is charged with making a mockery of the king and he\ndisguises himself as a bogus doctor\nto save his own life. Unfortunately\nfor him, his sexual misadventures\nhave chosen this time to punish\nhim. Elizabeth, his beloved theatre\ndarling also abandons him since she\nhas now achieved the star status\nshe has so coveted and has no use\nfor a crippled earl. Fortunately for\nhim, his wife Elizabeth (Rosamund\nPike) remains true to his bedside\nwhile his body self-destructs from\npast indulgences.\nFrom a critique\u2019s point of view,\nthe story isn\u2019t a unique one. Hence,\nthe director\u2019s choice to make this\ninto a film isn\u2019t exactly an inspired\ndecision. Fortunately for the direc-tor, he has Johnny Depp\u2019s talents to\nfall back on. However, is a one-man\nshow enough to make this film spec-tacular?\nPersonally, I have always been a\nfan of Johnny Depp and there were\na scattering of memorable scenes in\nthe film. One of them was a shot of\nthe earl lying helpless in his chair,\npissing onto the floor as he had lost\nthe ability to control his own blad-der. When his wife enters the room,\nhe tries in vain to assume a more\ndignified position. However, his wife\ncan see all the horrible marks his\ndisease has left on him. Hurt and\nfrustrated, Elizabeth spits out her\ndispleasure with his self-destructing\ntendencies. Nevertheless, for all his\nbastardly ways, she loves him and\nstays to help him until death comes\nto take him away.\nThefilmwillservetoimpressthose\nwho have not yet seen his role as the\nmaniacal pirate in Pirates of the\nCaribbean. However, an emotional,\nseeker of life\u2019s meaning earl is too\nmuch of a cliche. He\u2019s depressed,\nfine. He finds his life meaningless,\ntoo bad. Seriously, this story is just\na horribly overdone steak: dry and\ntough to swallow. The only perk was\nthat this story was easier to follow\nWhen a man thinks with his heart and not his dick he\u2019s in for a spot of trouble.\n8\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 24 November 2005\nthan the other depressing films I\u2019ve\nseen. The director could still have\ncaptured the mood of the film better\nif there was some internal narrative\nin the film.\nIn a nutshell, it\u2019s not your typical\nentertainment channel type of film\nbut its a poetic and artistic wannabe\nthat might appeal to some of you out\nthere. Watch it if you love Johnny\nDepp or if you have no idea of\nJohnny Depp\u2019s greatness. It\u2019s a film\nthat\u2019s bound to make you a Johnny\nDepp convert but it\u2019s definitely not\nhis most fantastic film to date.\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\n\ufb01lm film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nForeign \ufb01lm of the week: Atash\nIt de\ufb01nitely pleased the critics in the Cannes Film Festival, but what about Felix?\nAtash\nDirector: Tawfik Abu Wael\nStarring: Hussein Yassin Mahajne,\nAmal Bweerat and Roba Blal.\nLength: 110minutes\nCertificate:12A\nReleased:25 Novermber 2005\nHHHII\nW\nhat do you think when\nI tell you that Atash is\nan Isreali/Palestinian\nfilm? First thing that\ncomes to mind is\nprobably suicide-bombers and religious conflicts. However, Atash is\ndefinitely not the movie you have\nin mind.\nSurprisingly enough, Atash is just\na simple family story. Abu Shukri\n(Hussein Yassin Mahajne) is the\nhead of the family and he rules with\nan iron-fist. However, it\u2019s not just a\nstory of children living under his tyranny because he is in fact a tender,\nloving father at heart.\nThe crux of the story is the location of their home. They use to stay\nin town, where they had proper electricity and Abu had a proper job to\nfeed his family. However, Gamila,\nhis eldest daughter ( Roba Blal) was\nraped. The penalty for being a rape\nvictim: death. To save his daughter\nfrom this untimely and horrible fate,\nhe relocates his family to the middle\nof nowhere.\nHowever, conditions are harsh and\nten years later, the children and the\nmother rebel against their father.\nThe situation might have been different if Abu did not coerce his family into giving up school and other\naspects of their social life to make\nand sell charcoal. Nevertheless,\nwhat\u2019s done is done.\nThe acting is realistic and the story\nis eye-opening. It\u2019s a refreshing take\non the Palestinian society; a society\nterribly misunderstood due to the\nwars that has taken over their lives.\nI loved the film for its authenticity.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s not an easy film\nto understand. However, American\nfilms are easy to understand and\nmost of them are crap. So take a\nchance on Atash!\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Felix Locked up without food and warmth\n\n"

They got together in\ntheir second year (she was a physicist and he was a biologist).\nNow he\u2019s working as an accountant and she\u2019s a laser physicist at Imperial.\nParasmand: I\u2019ve got two separate groups of friends at\nImperial that I still keep in close contact with. One group is\nmore international and the other live almost around the corner from me. I don\u2019t really label them as Imperial friends, to\nme they\u2019re just my good friends. In fact a friend of mine who\nhas just finished his PhD at Imperial came to my school to\ngive a talk. Some of my students saw him and said, \u201cHe don\u2019t\nlook like no doctor!\u201d because their idea of a doctor is a medical doctor.\nImperial memories\nFalconer: A friend of mine, who\u2019s very keen on fitness, had\nThe Appeal of Teach First\nFalconer: During my final year, I was one of the people who\nwas unsure of what I wanted to do once I completed my\ndegree. I wanted to make use of my degree in some way,\ninstead of going into something like accountancy. However,\nhaving worked as a medicinal chemist during my industrial placement at GSK, I also knew I didn\u2019t want to go into\nresearch at a graduate level. The reason for this is that I\ndidn\u2019t want to commit to 2-3 years of post-doctoral work with\nthe aim of one career at the end of it, which would be as a\nmedicinal chemist. There was a lot I loved about labs but also\na lot I didn\u2019t, which was why I was so undecided. This is when\nTeach First came along. I saw it as an opportunity to study\na management course and as somewhere I could use my\ndegree to teach students but at the same time not be totally\ncommitted to a career in teaching. So at the time, it seemed\nlike the perfect choice for me. Previously I didn\u2019t think of a\ncareer in teaching. I had always wondered what teaching\nwould be like and I would have liked to try teaching to see if\nit was the career for me. In this way Teach First was ideal as\nit offered me a taste of teaching and let me give back to the\ncommunity (to put it in a cheesy way). For me Teach First\nopened up more doors. You get so much out of it and come\nout as a qualified teacher. I went into the scheme knowing\nthat at least for some time I would not become a teacher but\nbecause I have the qualification I could always go back to it at\nany time. The way I see it, I didn\u2019t shut any doors but potentially opened several more and I\u2019ve learnt a lot about myself\nthrough this scheme.\nParasmand: I actually took two years out before doing Teach\nFirst. I graduated and started working for the civil service.\nI then went to Africa with the charity Raleigh International.\nDuring this time, I was trying to sort out what I wanted to do.\nTeach First hadn\u2019t really started yet and I was trying to convince myself that I wanted to become an accountant. Then,\nthrough Milkround I heard about Teach First and out of inter-est, I decided to apply. Having then spoken to someone from\nTeach First, I decided to complete my application. I went\nthrough the interviewing process and got a place for Teach\nFirst, and here I am, teaching. However, if Teach First was\navailable to me straight after my degree, I probably would\nhave done the course immediately and not taken the two of\nyears out.\nWhat appealed to me was that the course seemed like an\nexciting way to spend two years. It was a worthwhile chal-lenge, not just helping the kids but it also helped me. With the\nway the course is designed, you\u2019re forced to develop all sorts\nof skills and be able to deal with all manner of people. I\u2019m only\na teacher now because of Teach First. Although I\u2019m happy to\nbe a teacher right now, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m always going to\nbe a teacher. I feel that there are still many more opportunities for me out there.\nThrough Teach First, I\u2019ve met a lot of people that I wouldn\u2019t\nhave had the chance to meet otherwise and in that sense it\u2019s\ngiven me this network of people. I have to say that working\nwith children do have its fun moments. In my first year of\nteaching, I asked a year 8 class what an organism was. This\ngirl raises her hand and whispers to me: \u201cIs that what girls\nget when they have sex?\u201d\nOn doing a PhD\nFalconer: I did think about doing a PhD. However, if I was to\nhave done a PhD, it would have been done to benefit a particular career goal. Although I believe you get a lot of skills by\ndoing a PhD, it would have led me down a more chemistry-based career path and in that way Teach First seemed more\nfavourable for my particular goals.\nParasmand: Although I thought about doing a PhD, I was\nseeking new and different challenges and decided that a\nPhD was not for me. In a way I would definitely recommend\nTeach First for people who aren\u2019t sure of what they want to\nAlisdair Falconer & Pedram Parasmand\n7\nfelix\nThursday 24 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nsome special fitness equipment in his room. We faked a letter from the housekeeper saying that there have been some\nstrange noises coming from his room. He received it and took\nit very seriously. So he went to talk to the housekeeper about\nit, only he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about!\nAnother good memory, first day of second year, my flatmate\nand I went out for a heavy drinking night. The next morning I\nlooked at my alarm clock blurry eyed and realised that it was\n10 minutes to our lecture. So I got up and banged on his door\nto wake him up. Then I went back to bed and realised that it\nwas two hours too early. So I thought nothing of it and went\nback to sleep. Later in the evening I came home to find my\nflatmate not particularly chuffed. He told me he arrived at his\nlecture at 7:10am and so had to help the caretaker turn on all\nthe lights in our department.\nParasmand: I guess the first thing that comes to me when I\nthink of Imperial is how international it is. You meet people\nfrom all over the world that you probably never would have\nmet otherwise.\nIf you had to do it all over again, would you choose\nImperial?\nFalconer: Yes.
