Rag started\nthe year with a bang and now that things have\nquiet e ned down a wee bit, take a little breather\nand look back.\nSeven weeks, seven weekends and more Rag\nevents than I can count (and I'm the Rag\nChair!). We started off the year with\nTiddlywinks followed by the excellent Drink-a pub dry. The next weekend saw live Monopoly\nwhere you had the opportunity to meet people\nfrom different Rags from all over the country.\nThen we went off down to Poole for the day\ncausing havoc in a Little Chef on our way back.\nFor the Rocky Horror disco, we all dressed\ndod gil y and then came Rag Week!\nRag Week has gone really well this year (see\npages 14 and 15 for more details) with all sorts\nof events raising lots of money for charity. In\nfact, this term we have raised approximately\n\u00a38,000 for various charities including Action\nAid, Mencap, Bliss (Baby Life Support\nSystems), BIBIC (British Institute for Brain\nInjured Children), WWF, Turning Point (Drug\nand Alcohol abuse charity), Leukaemia\nResearch and various local charities. This is all\ndue to over 300 people who have got involved.\nWhat did you get out of it? We've given\naway some super prizes, including our\nincentives which are mugs and T shirts, and\nthere have been opportunities to meet people\nand have loads a fun!\nYou need n't think that just because Rag\nWeek is over that you've seen the last of RAG.\nWe haven't run out of ideas yet and have lots\nmore things planned for this term and next\nincluding collections at concerts and football\nmatches, Rag Raids of to various parts of the\ncountry, discos and also in the summer term we\nare planning to hold our Rag Fete which last\nyear was a storming success last year. It is\ntraditionally followed by the Rag Dinner which\nhas to be attended to be believed.\nHaving said all that, we are always open to\nany suggestions you may have for events or\ncollections, so come and see us. We are in the\nRag Office most lunchtimes (2nd floor, east\nstaircase, Union building) and always welcome\nanyone. We also have Rag meetings in the\nUnion Lounge every Friday at 1.10pm( except\nwhen there is aUG M when we have it after\nthat).\nIt doesn't cost anything to join Rag, just a little bit of your time and we can guarantee you\na good time as a result.\nAll that's left to say is turn up, get involved\nand I hope to see you soon. We're here for you\nall year!\nIC 'Virgins' 24 - 24 RS M1st A windswept Osterley rugby ground was the\nscene for last Sunday's Rag match between the\nVirgins and the Miners. Andy Wensley agreed\nto make a guest appearance for the ladies but he\nshowed what a big girl's blouse he really was by\nstanding them up. Chris Davidson, last year's ICU President, agreed to take his place, despite\nknowing he'd take a beating for his trouble.\nAfter the Miners' version of the 'haka' the\ngame kicked off. The Virgins took an early lead\nwith a penalty in front of the posts. The Miners\nresponded with a period of intense pressure and,\ndespite being penal is ed for running too fast,\nmanaged to score a try. They converted it and\nled at half-time.\nThe second half saw three tries at either end.\nWith seconds left on the clock, the Miners tied\nthe scores up and their captain could have sealed\nthe game with his conversion but the pressure\nfinally got to him and he fluffed the kick.\nThe Miners left the field to find their trousers\nstolen, but thrashed the Virgins in a12 man\nboat race.\nThe IC Virgins need more players if they are\nto build on this result. If you'd like to try ladies\nrugby, check the noticeboard next to the\nTraditional Bar in the Union. No-one will be\nturned away and experienced players would be\nespecially welcome.\nCan You Play? 2001: A Space Odyssey\nThe Jazz & Rock Club exists to promote\nnon-classical music at Imperial College. Usually\nthis means holding gigs in the Union Lounge\nwhere bands can play without having to search\nfor pubs/venues around town that will let them\nplay. These gigs happen on alternate Thursdays\n(unless there's a Rag bash, like tonight).\nThis year, as well as gigs, something\ndifferent is happening. The chairman, in his\nignorance of technical matters, such as mixing\ndesks and PA systems, and of the general\nmodern music scene, is trying to put together an\nensemble to play non-classical music that he has\nwritten. It occurs to him that of 6,000 students\nthere must be 20-odd who can play guitar or\nsome other hand-held instrument and read a bit\nof music.\nIf there are actually such people who not\nonly can do all these things but who also are\nfree for an hour or so on Monday evenings and\nwho don't have to sit in their rooms doing\nnothing the whole time, they would be most\nwelcome in the UD H( opposite the Union\nOffice) at 7.30pm this Monday (22nd November). Otherwise people will resign\nthemselves to the impression that this is actually\nthe boring and antisocial college it does not\nhave to be.\nMany thanks to the few for their loyal\nsupport so far.\nStanley Kubrick's hypnotic epic is a true\ncinematic landmark. The story is that of\nhumankind itself, beginning at the Dawn of Man\nwhere some alien intervention (in the form of\nthat black monolith) provides the catalyst for\nhuman evolution: the knowledge of weapons.\nThis culminates in the discovery of a strange\nobject on the moon which transmits a signal out\ninto space towards Jupiter, again sparking\nhumankind off on an evolutionary odyssey.\nTo define the film too much is a mistake as it\nis largely visual and left open ended in its\nAfter a most successful week of Jurassic Park\nwhich boosted FilmSoc's membership to 1000+,\nwe are pleased to present Jurassic Park.

    "content": "News\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPhoto by Mike Chamberlain\nSmith Shuns Tory Science\nBY PAUL DIAS AND JOE MCFADDEN Labour Party leader John Smith,\nspeaking to a packed Great Hall at\nImperial College on Wednesday,\npromised to establish a Ministry for\nScience if Labour wins the next\nelection. The public meeting was\norganised by the Save British\nScience society (SBS), a pressure\ngroup aiming to improve public\nawareness of science and influence\nGovernment science policy.\nWilliam Waldegrave, Minister\nof Science, spoke to a SBS meeting\nat Imperial College earlier this year,\nbut Mr Smith is the first leader of a political party to address the\nsociety. His speech was generally\nwell-received, though some criticised it for containing few concrete\nscience policies.\nThe Labour leader discussed at\nlength the neglected state of British\nscience. Unsurprisingly, he blamed\nthe Government's obsession with\nmarket economics for the lack of\ncooperation between industry and\nacademic research, adding that he\nfelt it was \"shameful that an organisation like Save British Science\nshould be required to exist at all\".\nMr Smith claimed that science\nhad suffered as a result of the\nGovernment's policy of reducing\npublic expenditure. Speaking in\nTokyo recently, John Major, the\nPrime Minister, commented that\n\"perhaps we have undervalued\nscience and the application of\nscience in the UK\". Mr Smith\nsuggested that 'perhaps' the Prime\nMinister couldn't make up his\nmind. \"Surely even the Government\ncannot doubt that science and\ntechnology, education and training\nare crucial to economic growth,\" he\nadded.\nHe went on to criticise the\nScience White Paper for doing little\nmore than reorganising the science\nresearch councils. In an interview\nwith IC Radio earlier this week,\nProfessor JP. Connerade, the\nHonourary Treasurer of SBS, also\ncriticised the White Paper, calling it\n'a rather disappointing document'.\nProfessor Connerade, a lecturer at\nImperial College's Department of\nPhysics, complained that \"nothing\nis said at all about improving the\ncareer prospects of young scientists.\"\nMr Smith touched on this issue\nduring his speech, stating that \"it is\nlittle short of scandalous that\ndoctoral students should be expected to live on a total of \u00a34,730 a year\". But he did not explain how\nLabour would provide the funding\n'to attract the best talents available'.\nThe Labour leader recognised\nthe importance of both pure and\napplied research, saying that the\nonly real difference between the\ntwo \"is that some research has been\napplied and some has not yet been\napplied\". Labour would offer a scientific organisation with\n\"networks in which scientists and\nmembers of the business and\nfinancial community mix and\nexchange ideas\". He proposed\nestablishing 'intermediate institutions' along the lines of the 'so-called Faraday Centres' in order to\nencourage such networks.\nAnother priority of Mr Smith's was getting more teenagers to\ncontinue with science beyond\nGCSE by replacing the A Level\nwith a broader qualification, thus\nensuring that \"pupils at the age of\nseventeen shouldn't have to choose\nbetween the arts and sciences the\nway they have to under the present\nsystem\".\nProfessor Connerade remains\nunconvinced that any political party\ncan provide a solution to the\nproblems facing British science.\n\"Politicians have yet to learn how\nimportant science is to British\nsociety and to broadcast this fact to\ntheir electorate. This may be partly\nbecause they are not themselves\nscientists.\"\nDrugs and\nArson Attack\nin Hall\nBY PAUL DIAS AND LYNN BRAVE YA student was expelled from\nLinstead Hall last week by a residence tribunal which followed a drugs investigation. James Wilson,\na second year chemist, was found\nin possession of a small amount of\ncannabis and had been smoking it\non the premises.\nDr Jan Bradley, warden of\nLinstead Hall, told Felix that she\nwas alerted to the situation when a plumber, who had been called to fix\na blocked sink, informed the house\nkeeper of the smell of an illicit\nsubstance. \"I then requested advice\nfrom Imperial College Security,\nwho came over to speak to Mr Wilson. This was a few hours later\nand there was still a smell of\ndrugs,\" said Dr Bradley, adding\nthat Mr Wilson \"admitted a fair\ncop\".\nTerry Briley, Imperial College's Deputy Security Manager, said that\n\"the police were contacted\nfollowing the drugs find and are\nalways informed of any such cases\nat Imperial College\".\nAfter a separate residence\ntribunal, another student was\ndismissed from a hall of residence.\nThis followed a Hallowe'en Party at\nTizard Hall. The student concerned,\na resident of the Hall, set fire to a chair that was occupied by a female\nstudent, who was not hurt in the\nincident.\nOne resident commented: \"It\nwas a stupid accident that should\nnever have happened.\"\nCyberpunks and the\nAero Student\nBY ANDREW TSENG A research student at Imperial\nCollege is the star of a television\nprogramme being broadcast next\nweek.\nMonday sees the showing of a programme called Cyberpunks and\nTechnophobes. It is presented by\nTim Parsons, a PhD student at the\nDepartment of Aeronautical Engineering. Mr Parsons, in addition to\npresenting it, has participated in the\nresearch, direction, interviewing\nand editing of the programme.\nIn it, Tim talks to Douglas\nAdams, author of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and William\nWaldegrave (amongst others) in an\nattempt to explain the exodus of\npotential science students to the\narts.\nCyberpunks and Technophobes\nwill be shown on Monday at\n6.35pm on BBC2. Those in College\ncan see it in Da Vinci's. Reports to this week's UGM can be found on page 19\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 11\nThe London 6-Pack\nThe weekend of the 6th and 7th November saw\nthe first large inter-University team racing event\nof the season. The 'London 6-pack' event was\nheld at the Welsh Harp Reservoir, North London\nand hosted by the University of London Sailing\nClub. The event this year was smaller than usual\nwith just 13 teams entering. Nevertheless,\nCambridge, Bristol, Brunei, Newcastle, Oxford\nand Southampton were among the Universities\nrepresented.\nSaturday morning dawned miserable and\ngrey but with a promising fresh breeze. IC found\nitself in a tough league which included Soton,\nthe University team racing champions and, as\nthis event was the first at which an Imperial\nCollege team had sailed together competitively,\nwe were unsure of our standard.\nOur first race against Oxford was pretty\npromising. We expected to be slaughtered but\nsailing aggressively and confidently we found\nourselves after just one lap in a winning\ncombination (pending two protests exchange at a messy leeward mark rounding).\nHowever, disaster was to strike when our\nboat, in first place, missed a mark and quickly\nsailed backwards to sixth place! Unfortunately,\nwe could not recover and lost the race.\nThe next two races were against Soton and\nCastaways and, as expected, experience and\nsuperior training and tactics counted for more\nHello all you happy people. The West London\nChaplaincy is a very much student based\nsociety, with a few weirdos who call themselves\nchaplains trying to keep order. The Chaplains\nare the official voice in IC on religious matters,\nbut don't let this put you off. They are quite\nnormal really and there are a number of people\nwho join in various meetings throughout the\nweek that deal with topics that are very relevant\nto students. The Chaplaincy welcomes people\nfrom all backgrounds and would like to hear\nfrom anyone interested in all matters spiritual,\nwhether that person be Christian or not.\nCome along to one of our lunchtime groups,\nlike 'Believe it? Or Not?' - a lively debate on\nissues of faith and whether we should or do\nbelieve them...or not. It is held on Wednesday\nlunchtimes from 12.30pm to 1.30pm in the\nChaplaincy Office in the basement of 10 Princes\nLast Wednesday the annual simultaneous\ndemonstration of chess prowess by the Maths\ndepartment's resident Grandmaster, Dr\nJohnathan Mestel, took place in the UDH. The\nevent attracted college wide interest from\nplayers of all abilities, ranging from novices to\nthose seeking glory, honour and a good game.\nUp to 30 games were in progress at any one\ntime as Dr Mestel tirelessly made his way from\nboard to board over the course of four hours,\nwreaking havoc amongst the college rank and\nthan cheerful optimism and determination!\nThe fourth race of the day was against Brunei\nwho are of a similar standard to ourselves. In\nprevious years they were the team to beat. After\na good start by the Imperial College boats we\nwere second, third and fourth by the first mark\nwhich was shortly converted, by some natty\nteam racing and tactics, to first, second and\nsixth. While Imperial College's first two boats\n'yot ted' off into the distance the third boat was\nleft to battle along alone. After a tense second\nlap we crossed the finish line in first, second and\nfifth places to record our first win of the season!\nAfter a fairly typical Sailing Club party in the\nevening consisting of XS beer and chilli, Sunday\nmorning found an anxious Imperial College\nCaptain pacing the boat park awaiting the arrival\nof all the team.\nThe first race of the day was against London\nLadies and another win was sailed with a ringer\nborrowed from another team as our third helm\narrived one and a half hours late and then\nwithout any sailing kit! The remaining three\nraces were lost, but the team learnt lots which\nshould stand us in good stead for the rest of the\nseason which will include both league and\nfriendly matches, as well as more all-weekend\nevents.\nAll in all a good start to the sailing season.\nGardens and is held vaguely together by Alastair\nMcCollum, the Chaplaincy assistant.\nIf you're not sure about coming along but\nwould like to hear a bit more about us, why not\nget Chi Rho, the weekly magazine sponsored by\nthe Chaplaincy. It will inform you about what is\nhappening and contains articles on just about\nany issue you may be interested in. Articles in\nthe past year range from the ordination of\npuppets (a highly irreverent furtherance of the\ndebate on the ordination of women) to our\nregular 'Issues in Science and Religion' which\nmerges the two until the boundaries become\nunclear.

Pop in for\na coffee and a chat, you'll be most welcome.\nfile. Of the 40 games played, Dr Mestel won 35,\ndrew three, and lost only two.\nThe wins were achieved by Ian Moody\n(Materials PG3) and Daniel Sheppard (Physics\n2). Prakesh (Mech Eng UG1) secured a draw, as\ndid two others who were so overcome by their\nachievement that they immediately rushed\ntowards the bar without identifying themselves.\nThe Chess Club would like to thank Dr\nMestel and all those who participated in making\nevent a success.\nNo Half-Time\nOranges\nIC 1 - 4 Goldsmiths\nIt was cold and bloody windy - even the referee\nput off going out as long as possible by having\nthe coin toss inside. Luck was with us in the\nfirst half, as was the wind. We played really\nwell showing a lot of improvement since our\nlast match against Goldsmiths. The change from\nthe usual line up, which put Karen as striker\ninstead of midfield, proved to be a good move\nwhen she picked up a loose ball in the box and\ncurled it around the keeper to put us up 1- 0.\nGoldsmiths pulled the same trick which they\nused last year to beat us in the cup - the tactical\nploy of not providing oranges at half-time took\nits toll on our team. The lack of vitamin C needed to face the cold wind meant that we soon\nfound ourselves down by a goal.\nDespite some good runs, a great tackle by\nDalya (sorry ref, honestly, I did mean to kick\nthe ball!) and Linda's amazing save of a breakaway (perhaps not graceful, but definitely\none to remember) we finished the match 1-4.\nAs for the boat race, Goldsmiths all disappeared before we even got the chance to\nchallenge them, probably due to our easy\nvictory over them a few weeks ago.\nLong-Awaited\nHockey Victory\nMen's Hockey 2nd20 Brunei Men's2 nd Four years! At last! Having been on the\nreceiving end of some appa ling umpiring and\nsome appa ling bad luck, we finally got a long-awaited result against Brunei.\nBrunei started strongly, the boys taking time\nto settle into their stride. Lee Maartensze kept\nthe side from going down with some Shiltonesque diving saves.\nOur determination shone through, scoring a goal against the run of play, a goal which was to\nturn the game. James Cooper, getting the stick\nto a long corner strike, left their keeper stranded.\nIn the second half we were reduced to ten\nmen as Steve Owen was dismissed from the\nfield of play for some strong armed tactics.\nComposure held out and Ben Maxwell sealed\nBrunei's fate, roofing the ball from a well-worked manoeuvre.\nThe win ensures our passage to the second\nround of the U AU competition next term, with\nstill one match to play against Reading.\nP.S.

This lets you drive flat\nout without endangering your license.\nCadwell Park is a beautiful racing circuit in\nthe depths of Lincolnshire (i.e. the middle of\nnowhere). The circuit itself is technically fairly\n'slow', meaning that the straights are not so long\nthat you'd sit with your foot flat on the accelerator most of the time in a standard road car.\nInstead, there's lots of interesting comers to\nkeep you amused!\nDon't worry if you've never driven on a circuit before, as experienced club members\nshow everyone the ropes. As in previous years,\nall types of cars, from standard road cars to fully\nprepared racing cars, can be used. The cars will\nbe split into two groups, 'fast' and 'slow', which\nwill have use of the circuit separately. This is so\nthat those of us in standard road cars need n't worry about being constantly harassed by\nFormula Fords screaming past as we lap the\ncircuit at slightly slower velocities.\nOn a more technical note, this allows you to\nset up your car's handling and performance and\nteaches you correct lines through corners; don't worry, there are plenty of run off areas onto the\ngrass should you make a slight misjudgment,\n\\ >\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nalthough I must confess the grass is somewhat\nbumpy. Basically it's a bloody good day not to\nbe missed!\nFull marshal and medical cover is provided\nby the circuit. Racing overalls are not required,\nbut helmets must be worn. Anyone without a helmet may borrow one free of charge from the\ncircuit, subject to a \u00a310 returnable deposit. The\ncost of the day will be \u00a320 to Imperial College\nstudents and you will get approximately three\nand a half hours of track time.\nTo sign up for the Circuit Trip, or to find out\nmore about Motor Club events, come into the\nCity & Guilds Union Office (level 3, Mech Eng)\nany lunchtime and ask to speak to a member of\nthe Motor Club, or look on our noticeboard\n(level 3, Mech Eng).\nTUESDAY23 rd NOVEMBER Greek Menu\nMAIN DINING HALL11.452.00S HER FIELD "

    "content": "Reviews 9\nHard Target\nStarring: Jean Claude Van Damme, Yancy Butler\nDirector: John Woo\nHard Target is the result of the partnership\nbetween the acclaimed Hong Kong based\ndirector John Woo and the popular action star\nJean Claude Van Damme\nWoo has won a fervent critical following in\nthe U.S. for his violent and soulful gangster\ndramas. The intensity of his action scenes are\nreflected in this American directing debut. His\nsecret lies in the exploiting of strong dramatic\nsituations and the conflicts of rich and strongly\nmotivated characters.\nVan Damme plays the part of Chance\nBoudreaux, a down-on-his-luck New Orleans\nmerchant sailor. His quest begins when he\ncomes to the rescue of a young woman (Yancy\nButler) who then recruits him to find her\nhomeless father who recently disappeared. The\nchaos following a city-wide police strike makes\nNew Orleans an excellent site for former\nmercenaries Emil Fouchon (Henricksen) and Pik\nVan Cleaf (Vosloo). They devise a murderous\ngame, purely as a business venture, whereby\nunknown homeless Vietnam veterans are forced\nto act as human prey in exchange for a large sum\nof money.\nw mmm Chance discovers the evil plot following the\ndeath of two war veterans and exacts vengeance\non the killers. This sets off a deadly contest\nbetween him and Fouchon, which shifts from the\nmean streets to Chance's home terrain in the\ntreacherous Louisiana bayous. He leads his\nhunters on a wild chase and proves, to their cost,\nto be the ultimate hard target.\nThe plot is at all times very predictable and,\nfor this reason, Woo relied heavily on the\nill authenticity of his action scenes. Each twist in\nthe story serves primarily as an excuse for Van\nDamme to show off his muscles and martial arts\ntechniques and this film is a glorification s of\nviolence and strength.\nJohn Woo's masterly direction of all the\naction scenes is for all to see, but be expected to\nbe let down by the frustrating ly apparent lack of\nbelievable plot.\nHans Christian\nSnake Eyes\nThe idea of a film being made within a film isn't particularly new. However, Snake Eyes is a very\ndifferent due to the sensibilities of director Abel\nFerrara, of Bad Lieutenant fame.\nKeitel is superb as the director shooting a film about the degeneration of an open\nmarriage, gradually finding himself identifying\nmore and more with the violent husband.\nMadonna excels as the manipulative starlet\ngetting abused both on-screen and off by an\nactor in the midst of an Apocalypse Now-type\nexperience.\nThis film's essence is in the initially clear\ndistinctions between 'real' lives and scripted\nevents which eventually get blurred when the\nviolence, alcohol and drug-abuse quotients start\nto rise.\nDespite some ponderously slow pacing, the\nemotional and physical violence are consistently\nboth gripping and harrowing, with neither the\nextremes which led to the audience-alienation\nthat marred Bad Lieutenant, nor the bland\nexcess that permeated King Of New York.\nSnake Eyes doesn't share the cheap look of\nthose two films though, even if it does share\ntheir attitude. A thoroughly recommended film,\nthen, if you can stand the lack of speed.\njk\nill III\nLibera\nLibera comprises three Neapolitan vignettes\n(Aurora, Carmela and Libera) which are firmly\nembedded in the European scheme of cinematic\nsocial comment. Like films from Spain's Almodovar, Libera chronicles the experience of\nurban women. They get neglected, dumped,\nripped off and all that kind of stuff although, as\nthe film progresses, we see a kind of triumph\nthrough adversity.\nThe first film, Aurora, is the bleakest as the\ntitle figure ends up walking the streets without\nmoney, husband, friends or possessions. The\nfinale, Libera, flirts with the realm of comic\nsurrealism as a hard pressed working woman\novercomes her lazy husband in a typically\ncontinental way. Oh yes, recourse to sex as a philosophical metaphor. Sparky turns of humour\nseem to sweeten the load but some of it is so\nblack as to be around midnight. It's equally part\nof the film as the more obvious grime. And\nwhile these are not realistic dramas in a strict\nsense, the viewer is always pointed towards\nrealism. Yet this approach seldom fulfils its\naims. The feel of forced conclusions is too\nstrong where tailored observation would\nperhaps accomplish more.\nTintin\nLittle Dreams\nKhaled El Hagar's film provides a dramatic\ninsight into the personal and political conflicts\nbesetting Egyptians in the 1960s. The film charts the effects of war on\ncivilians as seen through the eyes of a thirteen\nyear old boy, Ghareeb, whose father died in the\n1956 Suez war. Ghareeb lives with his lonely\nwidowed mother during the period before the\noutbreak of the 1967 war with Israel. He\nbecomes involved with political activists partly\nbecause he is looking for a substitute father\nfigure.\nA close look at human relationships is a strong feature of this film - particularly the\nrelationship between the boy and his widowed\nmother. The characters are impressive and the\nscene is well drawn.\nThe film has an award from the Birmingham\nFilm Festival to boast of and to say that it's refreshingly un-exploitative and extremely\nemotive would be little praise for such an\nexcellent film that surely deserves a very wide\naudience. I was very fortunate to be able to\ndiscuss the work with its writer/director after the\nshow.\nAmir Rehman Khan\nA review of Looking Through A Glass Onion is on pag\n\n"

We learn that the attraction of the\nordinary person to them is just an effect of the\nfake glamour they project, much like a real life\nscenario.\nIt is somewhat of a tongue-in-check\ncommentary on many contemporary issues such\nas royalty, power, women's lib, marriage,\nglamour and image.\nIt succeeds in conveying the brand of humour\nwhich the author is good at and which everyone\nwants but ends up feigning, i.e. warm and\nobservant.\nThis science fiction fantasy has marvellously\npoly dimensional character is ation, a lack of\nwhich other books of the same genre are\ncriticised for.\nThus it has a mixture of all that is required\nfor a good book: storyline, humour, suspense\nand a frightfully, but not too clich6 d, happy\nending.\nAll in all, it is a good introduction to\nPratchett's style of writing, and a great part of\nthe series for a fan.\nnon comp osment is Published by: Corgi\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nIt Doesn't Take A Hero\nby Norman Schwarzkopf\nNorman Schwarzkopf sprang to fame during the\nGulf War of 1990/91. His autobiography tells of\nthe career that led him to be Commander-in Chief for all Gulf War coalition forces, from the\nmilitary academy, through his promotion to\nfour-star general in 1988, to the climax in the\ndeserts of Iraq and Kuwait, to which a major\npart of the book is dedicated. This part makes\nfor fascinating reading, revealing a lot more\nthan news programmes ever could. The reader\ncan appreciate what a huge task Schwarzkopf\nhad (he was up against the world's fourth largest\narmy of 545,000 troops, and their associated\nequipment).\nAll in all, this book makes for gripping\nreading. Told in an often light-hearted way.\nSchwarzkopf comes across as being dedicated to\nhis cause. For those of us with any ambition,\nGeneral H.

    "content": "Reviews\nApres le Sphinx...the boxed set\nWhile Stravinsky's early ballets are a gold mine\nfor record companies, few conductors venture\nfar beyond his three most popular scores.\nHowever, Neeme Jarvi's series of Stravinsky\nrecordings for Chandos is proving typically\ncomprehensive. The five discs out this month,\navailable singly or as a boxed set, contain only\none pop item, Petrushka, and mainly feature\nchoral and symphonic works from Stravinsky's middle period.\nThe Orchestre de la Suisse Romande play\nbeautifully throughout, with great refinement\nfrom the brass in particular. Tone is helped by\nthe slightly resonant acoustic, which also blurs\nthe bass somewhat. The engineers favour a recessed, homogeneous sound and rival\nversions, such as the superbly remastered\nStravinsky Edition from Sony Classical, can\nseem more detailed. But returning to the natural,\nconcert hall balance of the Chandos recordings,\nthere's plenty there if you listen for it.\nThe first disc is taken up by the mar more al opera-oratorio, Oedipus Rex. (I vividly\nremember a production at the Coliseum a couple of years ago in which the Sphinx was\nrepresented by a set of giant flying dentures.)\nThe excellent cast and involved narrator earn\nJarvi's version a strong recommendation.\nAmong other recordings, Esa-Pekka Salonen's Sony Classical disc is well spoken of, and has\nthe advantage of a clearer choir and more\nspacious sound with a firmer bass. But\nSalonen's starry soloists are placed too far back\nand, with the exception of Anne Sofie von\nOtter's Jocasta, cannot match Jarvi's quality.\nThe second disc is pure delight. Lydia\nMordkovitch is ravishing in the violin concerto\nand the early, uncomplicated E flat Symphony\nmakes an unexpectedly rewarding coupling.\nThe warm acoustic which serves the rich Swiss\nsound so well in this work is less appropriate for\nthe later Symphony in Three Movements. The\ncomposer's own crisper, more coherent account,\nwhich comes as part of a Sony Classical two CD set of the symphonies, is preferable to Jarvi's, which is coupled with Le Chant du Rossignol\nand the Capriccio for piano and orchestra.\nThe situation is less clear cut regarding the\nSymphony in C and the great Symphony of\nPsalms. Jarvi chooses the more heavily\norchestrated 1930 version of the Psalms, rather\nthan the 1948 revision which the compose er uses\nfor his own much leaner, more plangent account.\nJarvi's sumptuous approach is a valid alternative\nand he is, at times, more fluent than Stravinsky.\nThe two conductors differ much less over the\nSymphony in C where, once again, Stravinsky\nhas the advantage of a clearer bass. The balance\nis tipped in Jarvi's favour by the infectious\nrhythmic spring of Boris Berman's account of\nthe Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments,\nwhich takes the Chandos disc up to a generous\n70 minutes.\nThat leaves Petrushka, in which Jarvi cannot\nmatch the remarkable clarity achieved by Pierre\nBoulez and the Cleveland Orchestra in their\nrecent D G release (coupled with the Rite),\nalthough his orchestra is at least as fine and he\nhas the edge for spontaneity. There is some\nlovely string playing in Apollo, Jarvi's coupling\nand occasionally a slightly high thrum factor in\nthe bass. Something which, I suspect, might be\nameliorated by an un feasibly expensive pair of\nspeakers.\nPatrick Wood\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON the best student offer in london!

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 17\nAnime, Baseball And Raw Fish\nAfter some unsuccessful years, the Japan\nSociety has risen from its ashes and is more\nactive than ever. We have a brilliant record so\nfar this year and we are probably the most active\nsociety this year. The society has organised more\nthan one event a week and distributed weekly\nnewsletters.\nEvents include ice-skating, which all the\nparticipants enjoyed, apart from our President\nwho got left behind! A trip to Quasar uncovered\nthe hidden talents of our G. I.s( no wonder the\nJapanese lost the war). A gastronomic trip to a Japanese restaurant, which introduced the most\ntraditional cuisine of the country, challenged\nthose who had never had raw fish before. (They\nall loved it!) Bowling once again proved that last\nyear's President is actually good at something.\nLast year, in his first ever bowling game, he\nscored a modest 120 points and has never looked\nback. We organise fortnightly Anime showings\nwhich have been appreciated enormously.\nFor those who don't know what Anime is,\nyou don't know what you have missed. Simply\nput, Anim6s are a very sophisticated form of\nJapanese cartoons. They are one of the most\npopular entertainments in Japan and other\nOriental countries. They involve the use of the\nmost sophisticated animation techniques, such as\ncomputer graphics, to produce realistic pictures.\nSome have excellent story lines and have\nbecome classics in Japan, from 'Nausicaa of the\nValley of Winds' to 'Fist of the NorthStar'.\nSome view it as childish entertainment, but in\nthe land of the rising sun, small kids to\ngrandmothers are known to enjoy them. This is\nbecause in Japan there are a wide variety of\nAnime, targeting all ages. Some are very cute\nand comic whilst others are famous for their sex\nand violence.\nAt our weekly meetings, Manga are shared\nout for the entertainment of our members.\nManga is the Japanese word for comics. Animes\nare usually based upon these Manga. In Japan,\nmore paper is used for comic books than toilet\npaper! It is one of the most successful sectors of\nentertainment and culture which has been\nunaffected by any kind of economic crisis. The\nvariety of Manga includes sports, romance,\nmartial arts, comedy, adult, fantasy and hi-tech/science fiction. Any Japanese kid who\nhasn't read a Manga is not Japanese.\nThe Japan Society have the honour of\npresenting, probably for the first time in the\nhistory of this College, a baseball team. This is\nnot the official baseball team of the College but\nof the Japan Society. We intend to challenge\nother Japanese societies or baseball clubs in\nLondon. Our first goal is to beat UCL and\ncontacts have already been made so that a match\ncan be played between the two Colleges. We\nhave also tried to play against other societies in\nthis College, such as the Tamil Society, but they\nchickened out. They promise to play us soon.\nYou might be thinking: Why it is that we\nhave taken this initiative? Well firstly, it is\nbecause baseball is one of the few non-Japanese\nsports (together with golf, soccer, tennis, female\nwrestling...) that is popular in Japan and hence\nwe wanted to present it to our members as a modern Japanese entertainment. Secondly, it\nwas because our Society had quite a few people\nwho were experienced and eager to play baseball\nand provided us with the minimum number to\nmake up a team. Finally, we wanted to have\nfriendly games to improve relations between\nsocieties and to increase interest in this game\nwhich unfortunately lacks popularity in this\ncountry.\nThe game is easy to play, has simple rules\nand is great fun. We are still looking for other\nmotivated players, whether they have played\nbefore or not. It's all for fun and you never\nknow, you might have a hidden talent for\nbaseball. A team has been established, each\nmember with their preferred position. Most\nimportant of all, we have a very good pitcher\nwith past experience(who loves to hit the\nbatsman!). We hope he will be able to lead our\nteam to success (not hospital!).\nSome people might think that this game is\nbased mainly upon the pitcher and the batsman\nand no team work. This would be the case if the\npitcher were perfect, eliminating his opponents\nstrike after strike. Unluckily, our pitcher, like all\nother human beings, is not perfect and therefore\nhe must rely on the defence of his team mates (if\nthey are still unharmed), as much as they rely on\nhis throws. Naturally, the best part of playing\nbaseball is hitting a home run, equivalent to a six\nin cricket.\nThe team does not consist only of Japanese,\nso there is quite a friendly and international\natmosphere which suits the spirit of Imperial\nCollege. We do play against each other, as there\nare normally enough people to have two teams,\nand everybody seems to enjoy themselves.\nIf you would like to find out more about\nbaseball or would like to play, you can come to\nour practice sessions on Wednesdays from 2pm and Saturdays from l pm in Hyde Park near the\ntennis courts or contact K. 'baseball freak'\nSasaki, our Sports Officer (Materials UG2).\nIf you would like more information about this\nour or any other events (such as Anime) come\nalong to the society's weekly meetings on\nWednesdays from 12pm to 2pm in the Sherfield\nAnteroom or see our notice board number 56 on\nthe Sherfield Walkway, opposite the Bookstore.\nJapan Society Meeting: Wednesday, 12-2pm, Sherfield Anteroom\n\n"

The\nonly reason I went to aUG M in my first year\nwas because explained it all to me. But, quite\nfrankly, I found it very boring. It seemed to be a lot of people sitting around and discussing\npointless motions and reporting on what they'd been up to for the last few weeks.\nBut I stuck it out and went to a few more\nUG Ms. Every now and again something\nimportant or relevant or interesting did come up.\nFor example, I bet you hadn't noticed that the\nUnion Bookstore and the chocolate machine in\nthe Union building didn't stock any Nestl6\nproducts.

By The Deputy President (Clubs & Societies), Charles Leary\nI outlined the basic day to day duties of this job\nin my last U GM report. The only thing to add to\nthis is that, for a large part of my day, club and\nsociety chairs will drop in to discuss any\nproblems that have come up. They are very\nvariable and I have done my best to sort them\nout. I will therefore use this U GM to report how\nthe new post of Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) is developing.\nAs the post is a new one, the response in the\nfirst few weeks has clearly shown that it was\nbadly needed. It is much more effective to do the\njob when club captains or chairmen regularly let\nme know what is happening. Some clubs seem\nto have no problems, but it is still important to\nkeep in touch with recent developments. I suspect that many people do not know what my\nrole is within the Union. I must stress that the\njob of Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) is\ncontrolled by the societies themselves and how\nmuch input or help they want from the Union.\nProblems can only be solved once it is stated\nthat the problem exists. The sabbatical team is\nextremely multi-talented, but we are not mind\nreaders or magicians. The first point of contact\nfor any club queries is the Deputy President, but\nMajor Sub-Committee executives must be kept\ninformed of what is happening. When a new job\nis created, communications will always be the\nfirst casualty. We are experiencing a few\nproblems in this department, so it is important\nthat you inform the people concerned as to what\nis happening, otherwise mistakes happen and\nthings tend to not get done.\nOne recent development worth mentioning is\nthat the College Athletics Committee is setting\ndown a strategy to guide sport for the future.\nThis will start by a student survey in Felix to\nassess what the student body wants from the\nCollege sports facilities. Everyone should be\nfilling this out as it will be the basis of a long\nterm strategy plan. If you use any of the sports\nfacilities then please fill this out and take a part\nin the shaping of sports in the future.\n...

I am\nlooking into this option for our Union further.\nThis is a system that could replace UGMs as our\ntop decision making body. It would put the\ndecisions into the hands of an elected body of\nrepresentatives rather than submitting it to the\nwhims of extreme elements that can exist in\ngeneral meetings as one sees in other Unions.\nCurrently I am gathering information in order to\nsee if this would be viable option for us.

    "content": "News 3\nGovernment presses ahead despite student and university opposition\nUnion Reform Legislation Imminent\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nAND DECLAN CURRY\nThe Government has stated its\nintention to pass a bill on\nfundamental Student Union reform\nwithin the next parliamentary\nsession. The decision was\nannounced yesterday in the Queen's speech.\nThe speech said that the\ngovernment ' will introduce\nlegislation to reform student\nunions'. It did not mention any\ndetails of the proposed bill, but the\nlegislation is expected to closely\nresemble the package of reforms\nunveiled by John Patten, the\nEducation Secretary, last July (Felix\n972).\nThe promise to legislate has\nbeen condemned by national\nstudent leaders and opposition\nparties, but welcomed by the\nConservative Students organisation.\nTim Kevan, National Director,\ndeclared himself 'delighted' with\nthe announcement, adding that\nreforms would \"confine the student\nunion closed shop to the bin.\"\nDon Foster, MP for Bath and\nLiberal Democrat Education\nSpokesman, called the announcement a bitter disappointment.\nLorna Fitzsimons, President of\nthe National Union of Students\n(NUS), said the decision to\nintroduce legislation 'has been\ntaken against the advice of\nuniversity vice-chancellors, college\nprincipals, parliamentarians,\nstudents and their parents'.\nThe NUS revealed plans to\nbecome a charity at the end of last\nmonth. This may enable it to\nsidestep the Government's proposals. The charity would deal\npurely with matters of student\ninterest, leaving all political\ncampaigning to a separate arm of\nthe NUS. This arm would be funded\nby voluntary membership contributions from student unions.\nThe legislation itself is expected\nto be similar to the package of\nreforms unveiled by John Patten last\nJuly. The plans proposed the\nintroduction of voluntary membership for some student union\nactivities, and the restructuring of\nfunding into essential (core) and\nperipheral areas. This means that\nservices such as sport, welfare and\nrepresentation would continue to\nreceive Government funding.\nActivities such as political, social\nand recreational societies would be\nfunded by other sources.\nAccording to Andrew Wensley,\nICU President, ICU would have to\nraise an extra \u00a3200,000 a year if the\nreforms were implemented.\nThe proposals were criticised by\nthe Committee of Vice Chancellors\nand Principals in a report earlier this\nmonth. The Committee described\nthe implementation as 'damaging\nand unworkable'. They suggested, a rethink of what constituted 'core'\nservices, and codes of practice for\nunions as a solution.\nConservative Party insiders say\nthat Mr Patten still regards student\nunion reform as essential, and say\nearlier reports that an announcement would be made (Felix 968)\nwere always correct. Labour Party\nsources say privately that they did\nnot expect an announcement.\nConservative activists predict\nfull blooded reform, as opposed to a simple code of conduct. But, any\nlegislation has to circumvent a brewing Tory back bench revolt on\nthe issue. Potential rebels include\nRobert Jackson, the former higher\neducation minister who conducted a review of student unions in 1988.\nMr Jackson, who quit the\nGovernment earlier this year, has\nalready said he will vote against any\nmoves which will extend Government power over universities. He\nclaims to have the support of a number of other Conservative back\nbench ers, and points out that 'it\nwould only take six or eight\nConservatives' to provoke a government defeat. However,\nAndrew Wensley commented\n\"we've got a fight on our hands to\nmake the Government see sense.\"\nIC Obtains Powers\nBY ANDREW TSENG,\nNEWS EDITOR\nPowers demanded by the former\nRector of Imperial College have, in\nprinciple, been granted. Following a meeting of the University of\nLondon's Senate, Schools of the\nUniversity will be 'delegated' the\nright to award degrees and appoint\nsenior academic staff.\nThe decision by Senate comes\nafter over a years discussion which\nwas triggered by Sir Eric Ash, the\nformer Rector, in last years\nCommemoration Day speech. In it\nhe said, \"we have resolved to\nembark on a review...to examine the\npossibility of a separation from the\nUniversity of London.\" As a result,\nProfessor Stuart Sutherland, the\nVice-Chancellor of the University\nof London, presented a paper in\nMarch detailing three paths that the\nUniversity could take. Option A, was for there to be no change; the\nsecond Option, B, detailed the\nposition of the University if the\nconstituent Schools became\nuniversities in their own right and\nOption C proposed that the University devolve the power to award\ndegrees and appoint senior\nacademic staff, to its individual\nSchools.\nAlthough accepted at July's Senate, discussion of the paper was\ndeferred until Wednesday this\nweek, the first Senate of the\nacademic year. Derek Roberts,\nProvost of University College\nLondon, welcomed the 'considered'\npaper, saying that it was an\n\"excellent way forward for the\nUniversity.\" Very little resistance to\nthe paper was met, however, Dr\nWilliam Stephenson, representing\nthe University's teachers, did\nexpress some concern that the\npaper, 'attempted to be all things to\nall people'.\nProfessor Sutherland also made\nthree recommendations which\nessentially proposed that Option C was accepted and implemented. The\nrecommendations were accepted\nwithout any opposition. Though\nsome present abstained, support for\nthem was so overwhelming that a count was not necessary.\nSpeaking to Felix after the\nmeeting, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, the\nRector, said: \"I think that in the\nlong term one would be looking in\nthis direction, but the situation\nchanges continuously, there is\n1 1\nalways a balance of considerations\nthat must be taken into account.\" Sir\nRonald did however think that there\nwere very few disadvantages. He\nadded that, \"it was argued [at\nSenate] that the University cannot\nin a formal sense delegate its\npowers, but it can delegate\nmechanisms\".\nThe Schools of the University of\nLondon have now been authorised\nin principle to award University of\nLondon degrees and appoint senior\nacademic staff on behalf of the\nUniversity. The implementation is\nto be left to the new Governing\nBody of the University of London\nwhen it is established later this year.\nThe deadline for articles is 6pm on Friday\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nHangin' With The Not At Home Boy\nFamous director Nelson George all alone in London? As ever, TonyGrew bend\nhis benevolent ear backwards to hear views on rap, rage and Californian Girls.\n111m HBP*\nNelson George flashes his 'come to daddy' eyes\nI want to start with an admission. Talented\npeople make me nervous. So when I went to\ninterview the author, journalist and filmmaker\nNelson George, I was not calm. He's one of\nthose people. You know, the ones who seem to\nbe good at everything. As I sat in the reception\nof his comfortable expensive hotel waiting to be\nushered into the presence of the great one, I tried\nto combat my nerves. If he's so talented, I told\nmyself, he's bound to be difficult, awkward and\ncontentious.\nMy fears had been compounded five minutes\nearlier by the realisation that I would be going in\nalone, not with five or six others as I had hoped.\nIf he turns out to be another Spike Lee then this\ncould be one of the most embarrassing moments\nof my short life. George's track record is enough\nto make any interviewer uneasy.\nA journalist by trade (even worse, that means\nhe will know exactly what I am doing wrong) he\nstarted writing for the Village Voice and was\nblack music editor of Billboard, the American\nmusic bible, for seven years. His eight books\nhave all been critically acclaimed; the one on\nMichael Jackson told sold over a million copies.\nIn 1986 he invested money in a first film by a fresh new talent called Spike Lee. George has\nco-written and produced several feature films\nsince She's Gotta Have It and the project he is in\nLondon promoting, CB4, has been a success in\nAmerica, with box office takings of around\n$20m. Once in his presence, he put me at ease. The\natmosphere is informal and we start to talk about\nChris Rock, who stars in CB4 and came up with\nthe original idea. \"We knew each other from\nhang in' out. He pitched the idea to me and we\ncame up with a story after he did New Jack City\n[in which he played a crack addict]\".\nThe whole idea is a refreshingly satirical one.\nRock plays Albert, a normal middle class kid\nwith two friends, Euripedes and Otis T. Otis, is\nobsessed with rapping. They are good, very\ngood in fact, but lack any credible image. A close encounter with a local drug baron, Gusto,\nleads Albert to re-model himself in the hardcore\ngang mould. The imprisonment of Gusto means\nthat they can use his name. The boys become a huge success, naming themselves after the\nnotorious Cell Block 4. Everything seems to be\ngoing well for them; a documentary is even\nbeing made about them. But then the real Gusto\nbreaks out of CB4, determined to wreak his\nrevenge.\nOne of the most appealing things about CB4\nis its ability to s at i rise nearly every aspect of\nmodern black culture while still appreciating it.\nSo, for example, Euripides becomes overly\nconscious of his American roots while Otis takes\nthe dubious title of Stab Master Arson,\ncompletely obsessed with groupies.\nCameo appearances from rap and hip-hop\nlegends such as Ice T, Dr Dre, Ice Cube and\nFlavour Flav lend credibility to the proceedings.\nYet through all of this hilarity it is obvious that\nthere is an important point to be made. The\nantics of the documentary maker come in for\nparticular ridicule, and the false realism of his\ncamera makes the whole exercise a little surreal.\nI was intrigued by the appearance of so many\nestablished 'names' - rappers are not renowned\nfor self-mockery, but George asserted that they\nwere more than helpful, pointing out that it is\ntheir own images they s at i rise. Indeed the hit\nwhich launches CB4 on the road to stardom\n'Straight Outta Locash' is a very obvious\nreference and homage to the NWA rap classic\n'Straight Outta Compton'.\nThe machismo and extreme bad language so\ncommon amongst rappers is also lampooned,\nwith song titles such as 'Sweat Of My Balls' and\nmuch posturing from MC Gusto. Yet George\nfeels that the roots and resonances of this form\nof music are much deeper: \"Rap articulates\nadolescent rage, in much the same way heavy\nmetal does\". He also notes the correlation\nbetween rap music and black cinema of recent\nyears. \"Boyz ['N' The Hood] is just like a rap\nrecord; for a lot of the younger brothers it is\nanother exploration of their culture\". And CB4\ncertainly marks another important step in a trend\ntowards investing more heavily in what used to\nbe glibly referred to as the 'Black Pack'.\nA few years ago, a film which effectively\nmocks such fundamentals of contemporary black\nculture such as Afrocentricity and sexual\nattitudes would have been inconceivable. Yet\nthis film has made good profit, even by the\nbizarre standards of Hollywood. Another thing\nto note is that Universal completely funded the\nfilm, a tangible indication of the box office\nappeal and studio confidence in what is fast\nbecoming one of the most lucrative movie\nmakers. This summer in the US, 'Menace II\nSociety' entered the charts at number one. The\npower of the message has been retained though,\nas George himself can testify. \"Menace, as well\nas doing very good box office, is still intensely\nviolent, but in the way a Scorcese movie is\nviolent. That's what Menace is...a black\nScorcese movie\". In a lot of ways, black film is\nbecoming film which happens to be made by\nblack people and that is encouraging. So the\nfailure of Posse does not necessarily mean that\nthere will never be another film about black\ncowboys.\nOne of the most endearing things about\nNelson George is his intense and lively interest\nin music and its influences. He feels heartened\nthat the growing audience for rap hasn't diluted\nthe message or the power of its delivery. \"Ice-T is still as forthright as ever. What these artists do\nis artistic.\" And yet the full meaning of this\nartistry at times seems to be almost secondary to\nthe truly mass appeal it has built up since 1987.\nAt the end, George declares himself to be\n\"frankly puzzled by the appeal of people like Dr\nDre. His album was the biggest selling one in the\nStates this year, and it's serious stuff, all about\ndrive by s, hos, you know. And then you go to the\nbeach and there's all these fourteen year old\nlittle California girls listening to it, thinking it's really great to dance to. Something is really\nfucked up there.\"\nNext Week: A review of Nelson George's latest film, CB4\n\n"

The rationale\nbecomes even more muddied as the rich polish\nwhich characterised their last album, 'Our Time\nIn Eden', is removed in the grinning mtv studio.\nStill, Natalie's voice remains as clear as her\nideals, the band manage to rub up some of the\nolder numbers to effect, but why the exercise is\nattempted, except for shining lucre? Yes I know\nthat 10,000 Maniacs have created some of the\npurest moments on the grown-up musical\ncanvas, maybe 'Verdi Cries' will never be\nequalled, but this album adds nothing but tarnish\nto their reputation. If this is how it ends up, the\nwhole unplugged\u2122 (and that's music being\ntrade marked please note) concept strikes me as\nbeing slightly gangrenous. Let me buy the world\nand fold it into my wallet. (5)\nTintin\nReleased on Elektra\nUncle Ttipelo\nAnodyne\nAs much as the bands concerned deny it, the\nmore it rises in my mind. Gram Parson's Burritos are finally roosting eastwards. Brothers\nand Sisters, we have been hit by a tidal wave of\ncountry-folk-rock, and Uncle Tupelo show\nthey've paid their dues on this their fourth\nalbum.\n'Anodyne' is a seamless work which hangs\ntogether being more than the sum of its parts.\nViewed as tissue and bone the flaws are evident,\nlike a vocal style surfacing on the rough side of\ndrowned whiskey. Stumping the whole though\nas a slice of life this would be a concept album,\nif the genre allowed such. Each track has a concentric familiarity 'cos Uncle Tupelo know\nwhat they're doing and without brash flair\ndisplay that knowledge for 11 of the album's12 tracks. The only clumsy retrospection being the\ntitle track; painless and bleached white as the\ndesert's skull.\nDespite this, there's an awful lot of real time\nsounds to be enjoyed. The breeze blows 'We've\nBeen Had' down the steel strung highway.\n'Acuff-Rose' gets by on the screech ie twinning\nof mandolin with fiddle and further authenticity\ncomes with the banjo man on 'New Madrid.' So\nget out and go to hug that of swamp tree. (7)\nTintin\nReleased on Sire/Reprise\nNatalie Merchant - looking back on the 999 she\nleaves behind, as they fly over the cuckoo's nest.\nInsides\nEuphoria\nCome step on the merry-go-round. Playground\npsychosis again. Here's a hook to hear to. A scarf of sound to wrap around your head -comforting, soothing, cyclic. Fall back into\nyourself, the womb beat of Seefeel\ndisembowelled to flit lightly through the air.\nYou are calm.\nAnd then, like a baby born, she comes out\nscreaming. Screeching in soft tones - oh\ndictionary definition be damned - this soft voice\nonly slightly out of kilter is clinically anguished.\nLike mental butter your mind receives her like a knife. \"And how long before I'm dead below\nthe waist? And I can finally come clean, lie back\nand not feel?\" Panic. Your brain is now frantic,\npinned down like a dying half-crushed\ncockroach. Where's the ambient opium, the\n'everyone live love life' nursery rhyme sung by\na Brixton backing singer? They've killed her. \"I hate lovers, I hate the way they go to the\nbathroom in shifts after they have ****ed.\" Sex,\nviolence and suburban madness made into a stuttered mantra. Each song whirrs away in a post vocal comedown and the two second\nsilence deafens. Then we begin again.\n'Euphoria.' An album to lose your mind to. (8)\nOwain\nReleased on Guernica.\nMolly Half\nHead\nSulk\nThe Mollies have released their debut album\nstraight from the gut. No creative anxiety about\nconsistency here, just a mix bag of varying styles\nwithin the guitar genre. Songs like 'Ginger Pat's Avenue' are reminiscent of John Lennon's bad\ntrip psychedelia and others like Talking Heads\nor Bryan Ferry. My fave, the ephemeral 'Arty\nBreakfast' is sparse, full of unrest and positively\ninsane. The notion of it was probably taken\nfrom Pink Floyd's 'Alan's Psychedelic\nBreakfast', but the actual content is rather\ndifferent. Whether these comparisons are\nrelevant as influence or blatant plagiarism is\nopen to debate, but I for one couldn't care less.\nThe tension throughout never quite seems to\nbe resolved and this is why, for me, it's such a complete cork er. The bottling up of emotion, is\nonly partially released through the music. But\nthis isn't just a case of drowning in other\npeople's misery, it's perfect for those quiet\nintrospective moments in life, such as sulking.\nAnyway, this Mancunian band are here to\nstay and if you have a problem with that then\nyou are worth shooting. I will curtsy to them\nany day of the week. Lovely boys. (9)\nCamille\nReleased on Playtime Records\nElastica\nStutter\nIt is likely that early 80's English culture is\nbecoming the equivalent of 50's American\nkitsch. Oliver's Army and Paul Weller haircuts,\nhand in glove with long oldsmobile roadsters\nand Nu-Nile hair wax.\nElastica's debut single is more than anything\nelse very short. The saccharine free vocals and\n'cor b lime y feel to the whole record lends itself\nmore than a little to a certain member of the\nsinger's previous band, Suede. (Oh yes folks,\nthe only reason anyone used to go and see\nSuede before Morrissey stamped the divine seal\non them was this bird. Only a cynic would\npresume that that is the only reason anyone has\npaid a passing glance to Elastica.)\nElastica are definitely one to watch, but if\nyou want to buy 'Stutter', you'll have to wait for\nthe re-release, the 1500 copies sold out in two\nhours.\nGlyph\nReleased on Deceptive\nA report on the success of Rag Week is on pages 14 and 15\n\n"
