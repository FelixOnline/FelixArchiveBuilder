There is\nalso a disturbing trend\namong modern audiences,\nfor turning concerts into\nboxing marathons. Both\nwere in evidence at the\nHammersmith Palais last\nSunday where The Cult\nwound up their UK tour.\nDespite this they produced\nan evening of searing sweat\nand entertainment.\nHippies are back, no\nques it on about it. Ian\nAstbury looks like a cross\nbetween Jim Morrison and\nNeil of the Young Ones,\nalthough where Morrison\nwas the eloquence of a generation Astbury's vocabulary consists largely\nof 'Ta'. From even before\nthey came on to a blaze of\nprojectors there was no\ndoubt that the evening was\nlaced with the trappings of\npsych a delia. The\nsymbolism embellishing the\nnew album 'Love' is a ringer for Led\nZeppelin/Blue Oyster Cult,\nthe titles echoes of the\npeace generation. They\neven played Doors and\nNew Faces over the PA\nbetween bands. But this is\na new sort of love and\npeace, th re ashing along to\nreverberating guitar,\npierced by tribal rhythms.\nAnd out on the floor almost\nthe whole area seethed\nwith flailing people. The\nbare chested heavies were\n'chicken dancing' almost\nbefore the group came on,\nbut this wasn't about a small crowd at the front,\nthis was total audience\nreaction.This sort of gig is a physical endurance test, I was surprised no-one got\nhurt -most of all me.\nWith gigs like this at t ne Palais one wonders why\nthe Hammersmith Odeon\nbothers to stay in business.\nTable Tennis\nThe table tennis club is still\nlooking for high standard\nLeague players for its first\nand second teams. Anyone\ninterested please contact\nAndy Lenny on internal\n5957 or come up to the\ntable tennis room which is\non the top floor of Beit\nbuilding east.

However a number of witnesses have\nQT\nclaimed that he actually\nsaid 'Eat lead So aker make my day!'\nThe body was dragged\nfrom its pool of blood by\nthe patrol over to the Union\nbuilding, where it was\nunfortunately mislaid.\nTherefore the identity of\nthe suspect remains\nunknown: Was it the\nSoaker or was it the\nCollege window cleaner?\nThe Board retired to\nconsider their verdict after\nbeing advised by the\nChairman of their future\nprospects for advancement\nwithin the QT.

Weird and\nwacky schemes for the\nUnion have been suggested\nby Sherfield beau rau crats and Union Officers but in\nthe end it took Prof Ash to\nsee sense. It is obvious that\nthe Union needs a room to\nhold parties in. It is\nsensible that students\nshould control the Union\nBar.\nThe threat to the Union is\nstill not over though.\nBiology are (as reported in\nFELIX last week) intending\nto move out of Ashurst\nLodge gradually and also\nwant to gradually move the\nstaff back to London. This\nmeans that in a few years\nthe department will need\nmore room on campus and\nthey will start moves to\ntake over the Union again.\nCollege has been muttering\nabout moving the Union\nfrom Beit since 1982. Next\ntime Biology ask, they may\nreceive some of the Union.\nIt is vital that Carl Burgess,\nUnion President, gets an\nagreement from College\nabout the long term future\nof the Union so that we can\nplan how to develop the\nUnion.\nSecurity\nOver the last few weeks\nnumerous handbags,\npurses etc have stolen from\nparts of the College.\nProfessional thieves know\nthat students leave val ub les lying about so don't leave\nthings lying about unless\nyou want them to be stolen.\nSouthside\nHaving tried Southside Bar\n\u2014 The Sequel (the wine\nbar next to Southside) I can re com end it\nthoroughly. The pizzas are\nexcel lant value and you can\nphone in orders (int 3286)\nand take away if you want.\nRag Record\nSeveral weeks ago there\nwas something about a gogo record being sold for\nRag. The person selling\nthis is in Pet Eng 1 and not\nthe department stated.\nJobs\nKathy has just told me she\nhas a list of jobs for people\nwanting to work this\nChristmas. Go and see her\nif you're interested.\nNormans\nIt seems that nobody is\neating at Norman's Snack\nBar on a Wednesday\nevening. Please support\nthis venture if you play\nsport. You can only get\nboring Mars bars at\nHarlington. Why not eat at\nNorman's rather than\nHarlington.\nFELIX\nThere won't be a FELIX\nnext Friday. Instead there\nwill be an extra-special\nissue on the last\nWednesday of term. The\ndeadline for letters, sport\netc will still be 1.30pm Monday.\nCredits\nThanks to Chris Stapleton\n(I finally remembered your\nsurname), Dave Jones,\nRichard Smith, Bill\nGoodwin, Mike Stone,\nRichard Smith, Rosemary\nHosking, Tony Churchill,\nAndy Vickers, Richard Ellis,\nSarah Kirk, Jim Clayden,\nMark Cottle, Charlie Troup,\nChris Edwards, Debbie\nWilkes, Kamala Sen, Jane\nSpiegel, Sunny Bains,\nGrenvil Manuel, Alan Rose,\nTracey, Lesley Gillingham,\nDon Fergusson, Pete\nHobbis and everyone else.\nYou're all wonderful.\nThere will be a staff\nmeeting at 12.30pm today.\nThe Union Refectory\nIs Open\nWednesday\nEvening\n5.30pm7.30 pm A Slagging\nA Complete Condemnation\nof the IC Union Sabbaticals\nby the IC Badminton Club\n'What a bunch of w allies!'( A quote from one of the\nbadminton club players.)\nOnce again, the Union\nSabbaticals have made a complete cock-up of what\nis one of their most basic\nduties\u2014the booking of\nminibuses. So, let this be a warning to all you club\ncaptains, especially the\n'unimportant clubs' ie\nbadminton (or at least\nthat's the impression that\nthe sabbaticals gave us);\neven after giving three\nweeks notice of a minibus\nbooking, don't ever actually\ntrust the union!\nThe Story\nOur badminton club\ncaptain was told by\nQuentin to collect the van\nfrom Budget Car/Van Hire,\nin Earls Court. Accordingly\nwe left IC at 11.00am to\nwalk to Earl's Court to\ncollect the van, arranging\nto pick up the other players\nat IC at 12.00am. On arriving at Budget,\nthe brunette behind the\ndesk denied all knowledge\nof an IC booking\u2014all their\nvans being fully booked\nuntil the end of the month.\nUnabashed, we tried the\nblonde, but she too denied\nall knowledge. Panic. We\ntried phoning the Union\nOffice-Quentin wasn't in,\nbut Cathy confirmed that\nwe should have had a booking with Budget. We\ndecided to head back to\nthe Union Office, as there\ndidn't seem to be any\n'spare' vans in sight.\nBack at the Union at\n11.50am the refrain of the\nday seemed to be\n'Quentin's returning in five\nminutes'. Unfortuntely, one\nand half hours later, this\nrefrain had lost some of its\nappeal. So, as Carl had\ngone home to visit mummy\nas he was ill, we were\nforced (in sheer\ndesperation) to turn to\nDave, the deputy president,\nfor help. To our immense\nsurprise, Dave actually\nacted\u2014 picked the Union\nvan bookings file and\nstudied it very intensely.\nHowever, as this course of\naction wasn't very\nforthcoming, he turned his\nattention to a different\nsource\u2014the yellow pages.\nSeveral phone calls later he\nmanaged to locate a hire\ncompany with a spare\ntransit van. This was\n1.30pm, and we were told\nto collect the van in an\nhour. Hurray\u2014we might\nactually get there. So, over\nto Battersea, to eventually\ncollect the van at 3.00pm. All went well, until we\nreached the first junction\non leaving the van hire\nfirm. The van stalled.\nPuzzled, we restarted the\nengine, and continued as\nfar as the next junction,\nwhere the van stalled again.\nSeveral stalls later we\nreached IC to pick up the\nrest of the team, (only three\nand half hours late, with\nthe prospect of reaching\nNottingham on time (ie in a hour's time) fairly unlikely!\nHowever even the least\nmechanically minded\nplayers in the team could \u2022\nperceive that when the van\nstalled at every set of traffic\nlights/junction that there\nmust be some 'minor' fault.\nBut the badminton team is\ncomprised of keen players,\nwe all refused point blank\nto abandon the minibus,\nand continued on a rather\nslow journey out of\nLondon. Luckily the M1\npart of the journey was\nsomewhat more peaceful\nmostly due ot the lack of\ntraffic lights.\nNext trouble: the minibus\nrefused to start on\nSaturday morning-solution,\ncall out the AA, whilst two\nkind parents take the\nbadminton players to the\nUniversity Sports hall. The\nAA man was able to fix the\nminibus so that we'd get\nback to London, the main\ntrouble being the choke,\nbut this was partially solved\nby having somebody with\nfree hands to operate it\nwhilst we were driving.\nLuckily for us, that was\nthe last peice of trouble\nthat we encountered min-bus wise..un fortuna tley the\nbadminton troubles weren't as easily solved as the\nbadminton report will\nexplain\nConclusion\nThe Union Sabbaticals\nmade a total mess of this\nduty.

    "content": "t mm Football\nNew College 1st2 IC 1st1 IC lost their 100% League\nrecord in the ULU Premier\nDivision to a side who had\nobviously thought hard\nbefore the game on how\nbest to play against IC,\ntheir tactics eventually\npaying off.\nIt all started so well with\nIC going one up after 10\nminutes when Dave Lynne\nmet Martin Bradley's curling free kick with a header which went in off\nthe post. Despite several\nmore goal scoring opportunities which IC\nwere later to rue, the score\nremained 1-0 until half-time.\nThe second half was\nfinely poised when New\nCollege equalise d with a hotly disputed goal with the\nreferee 'I laugh when I'm joking' judging 3 New\nCollege players all offside\nbut not interfering with play\n( one of them scored the\ngoal).\nWith Nick Tarn\nperforming acrobatics in\ngoal, the game appeared to\nbe heading for a draw\nwhen IC, obviously\ndreaming of the high\nstandard of football that the\nref had been in control of,\nallowed New to take both\npoints from the game from\na corner followed by a goal\nmouth scramble.\nRS M1st s4 IC 2nds1 In a thrilling display of\nwildly dazzling stunningly\nbrilliant one touch football,\nRSM 1st's, a team surely\nunparalleled in the\nbrilliance and verve of their\nattacking play since the\nBrazilians of 1970, swept\naside the miserable\nmumbling wretches of IC\n2nds with an overwhelming\ntide of four goals\nmarvellously created and\nclinically finished by a group of players whose\nskill on the football field is\nsurely only matched by\ntheir humility and\ngenerosity off it. After\nbattering IC's goal the\ndeadlock was broken after\n20 minutes by Pete 'Bullet'\nSedders, who added\nanother ten minutes later\npast the cowering imbecile\nwho now guarded the\nvisitors goal. Second half\ngoals came from 'Curly'\nWoodward and 'Chopper'\nWardle as the annihilation\nwas completed. IC actually\nmanaged to score near the\nend with their only shot on\ngoal.\nHockey\nWednesday\nUAU\nIC 1sts1( a 'ter extra time)\nIC won 4-1 on Hicks\nULU League\nRoyal Holloway 1\nSaturday\nMiddlesex League\nMens\nIC 1sts1 ULU League\nLadies\nIC 1sts6 Sunday\nMixed\nSt Georges 1\nFootball\nWednesday\nULU League\nNew College 1s ts2R SM1s ts4K QC6 th s4 Saturday\nULU League\nIC 1sts3 IC 3rds0 RS M1st s4 Friendly\nIndia Soc3 The results table this week\nis a little sparse.

The\nsmall ads is the place for\n'in-jokes'.\nRichard Ellis\nSports Editor.\nHockey\nIC 1 City 1 (4-1 on flicks)\nIC 1st XI hockey team,\nhaving gained maximum\npoints in their UAU group,\nplayed the Southeast finals\nagainst City University on\nWednesday.\nA scrappy but hard-fought first half saw\nImperial with a10 lead at\nthe break. Nick Hope\nslotted home a right wing\ncross before impaling\nhimself on the goal post. In\nthe second half City piled\non the pressure but the\nhome defence held out\ndesperately and the\nopposition forwards found\nit difficult to get into the\n'D'. Special mention must\ngo to Jim Garside's defenders for their\nexcellent 'do or die' tactics.\nEventually the City centre-forward scored a brilliant\nindividual goal so ensuring\nextra time. This too was\ngoalless, meaning the\nmatch was to be settled on\npenalty flicks.\nIan Parker, Paul Colman,\nJustin Brooking slotted\ntheir flicks to make it 3-1\nleaving Nick Collie to seal\nthe match with his highly\ndeceptive, 'snail like' daisy\ncutting flick.\nIC moved into the last 16\nto play Leeds University on\nWed 4 December.\nIC 1sts1 Harrow 2\nImperial started the match\nintelligently, moving the\nball around and marking\nthe opposition tightly, this\nled to a well taken goal by\nIan Parker, now the team's highest scorer. In the\nsecond half the opposition\nran the ball around and\nwith a little help from the\numpires scored two quick\ngoals from short corners,\nlan's Parker's polite\ncomments to the umpire\nabout going to the\nopticians meant Imperial\nwere down to ten men, but\nthe op posit on failed to\ncapitalize on it. The final\nscore was probably a fair\nresult. Moral of the game:\nAll old people go blind!\nSt Georges 1 IC Mixed 3\nThis was another epic day\nfor IC Hockey, with the first\nmixed victory in quite a while.\nPerhaps the most\nremarkable achievement on\nSunday was getting all the\nteam members to turn up,\nmore or less bright-eyed\nand bushy-tailed after a late night in that hot bed of\nsin more commonly known\nas Ms Rofe's flat. Then\ncome our first major setback as we narrowly\nmissed the train at\nWaterloo (by fifteen\nminutes), and had to wait\n45 minutes for another one.\nThe game eventually\nstarted a mere one and\nquarter hours late but we\ngot off to a very good start\nas Ann lost her skirt\nwarming up.\nPenny Ottway, still in a hypnotised state after\nThursday night,was our\nstar player managing to\nscore twice-sorry we didn't have any Moet et Chandon.\nUmpire Jon Stonham then\ntook pity on St Georges\nand awarded them a very\ncontroversial penalty flick\nwhich St Georges greedily\nsnapped up.\nWith the light fading in\nthe second half IC took a stranglehold grip on the\nmatch with plenty of\npenetrating attacks.\nHowever the game had to\nbe stopped to deal with astrea ker on the pitch as Jill\nThurlbeck's skirt fell off\nduring a short corner. (It\nshould be noted that the\nmale half of the team does\nnot necessarily approve of\nthe ladies new designer\nskirts.)\nIn the throws of the game\nnew recruit Pete\nDrummond Smith scored\nhis virgin goal for an IC\nteam. (Its not all its cracked\nup to be Pete), to take the\nfinal score to 3\u20141.\nAll in all a good day\nrounded off nicely with a quick game of hockey on\nthe station platform at\nCobham against Guy's Hospital\u2014score nil all.\nTennis\nTotteridge 8 IC Mixed 1\nIt was cold. It was early in\nthe morning and IC didn't have a full team as J Macmanus (Met and Mat 2)\ndidn't get out of bed in\ntime. Otherwise IC had no\nexcuses for losing the first\nmatch of the season to a team who were much better\nthan us on the day. The\nteam was M Morcos (Aero\n1), B Hunt (Civ Eng 1), S Cosulich (Biochem 1), and\nA Hill (Mech Eng 1).\n12 Friday 29 November FELIX\n\n"

She de sci bed the event as 'a really\ngood evening' and complimented all the performers. She\nadded that the publicity for the event had been generally\ngood, but she was disappointed in the word-of-mouth\npublicity around the college.

    "content": "0 IC And The\nEnvironment\nPublic awareness of\nenvironmental issues has\ngrown considerably over\nthe last decade, and this\nhas been partly due to the\nwork of Greenpeace and\nthe other pressure groups.\nThe result is a growing\npublic concern, which is\nreflected in an increase in\nthe amount of scientific\nresearch aimed at\ninvestigating the impact\ntechnological developments\nhave on the environment\nwith radioactive releases.\nYet, at present there is a great deal we don't understand about the ways\nthat radioactive pollutants\nbecome dispersed in the\nenvironment, and the\ndetrimental effects on\nhealth that may result from\nexposure to very small\ndoses of radiation. It is\nimportant that governments\nand the public have access\nto high quality information,\nso that balanced\njudgements can be made\non the basis of both social\nand scientific factors.\nHere at Imperial Colege\nthere are a growing number\nof research teams\nconcerned with the\ninteraction between\nscientific developments and\nthe environment. One such\nteam is the Environmental\nSafety group in the\nMechanical Engineering\nDepartment, headed by\nProfessor A Goddard. Their\nwork focuses on the\n: relationship between\nengineering plants and the\nenvironment, in particular,\nthe risks associated with\nradioactive releases. Much\nof their work is theoretical\nand based in the\nMechanical Engineering\nDepartment but they are\nalso involved in a great\ndeal of interdisciplinary\nI work, which has involved\nmoving across the\ninterdepartmental\nboundaries at Imperial. The\nsetting up of the\nEnvironmental Technology\nCentre in 1976 paved the\nway for this type of work\nbut it is still a formidable\ntask to coordinate projects\nbetween departments.\nHowever, the breadth of\nexperience gained makes\nup for this.\nA great deal of data on\nthe effects of exposure to\nhigh levels of radiation has\nbeen collected from studies\non the victims of\nHiroshima, and on people\nwho have suffered\nindustrial exposure. The\nlink between human\nexposure to relatively high\nlevels of radiation, and the\nincidence of cancer and\ngenetic effects is now\nwidely accepted. However,\nmuch less is known about\nthe effects of exposure to\nsmaller doses from artificial\nsources because they are\ngenerally swamped by\nvariations in the natural\nbackground level. So most\npeople work on the basis\nthat even the lowest doses\nof radiation may cause\nadverse effects. Then the\ndec is on has to be made as\nto whether man-made\nradiation exposure is only\nacceptable if it produces\ndirect beneficial effects, or\nas long as it remains\ninsignificant in relation to\nthe natural background\nlevel. In the case of medical\nexposure people accept\nthat the benefits outweigh\nthe dangers. But, the case\nof nuclear power plants is\nfar more contentious and\npeople have a right to know\"\nthe full facts before\ndecisions are made.\nProfessor Goddard's team have developed\nexpertise in many aspects\nof the way radioactive\nreleases, accidental or\notherwise, are dispersed in\nthe environment. In the\npast their work has covered\ntheoretical modelling of\ndispersal around buildings,\nnear shorelines (where\nnuclear power stations tend\nto be built) and over longer\nranges. Working for the\nEuropean Community, they\nhave been looking into the\ntrans frontier implications in\nthe event of an accident.\nEmergency procedures at\nnuclear power stations are\nclearly of importance and\nDr Apsimon of the group is\ncurrently involved in\ndeveloping improved\nmethods for predicting\nconsequences in the event\nof a major incident. In\nthese difficult\ncircumstances, decisions\nwould have to be made to\nprotect people, while\ndetailed information would\nbe lacking.\nPathway analysis for\nradioactive pollutants is\nparticularly complex as\ncloud exposure, inhalation,\nand ingestion of\n.contaminated foodstuffs, all\nhave to be considered.\nComputer models are used\nfor much of this work, but\nthe data has to be based on\na thorough understanding\nof the transfer processes of\npollution in the\nenvironment. As an aid to\nstudying how radioactivity\nfrom the atmosphere\nbecomes incorporated into\ncrops, a new interdepartmental wind tunnel\nhas been built at Silwood\nPark. The tunnel, which\nwas designed by Dr TaylorRussel from Aeronautics,\nwas inaugurated by the\nRector on 25 October. Dr\nBell from Pure and Applied\nBiology, and Miss Minski\nfr dm the Reactor Centre\nare collaborating on this\nproject, which should\nprovide valuable\ninformation for the\nassessment of risk in the\nevent of accidental release\nof radioactive poll utah ts The late 1984 there was\nan exceptional release of\nradioactive waste into the\nIrish Sea, from Sellafield.\nFollowing this event, the\nDepartment of the\nEnvironment asked the\nCollege to make a study of\nradioactivity levels in\ndomestic dust in Cumbria.\nFrom this project the group\ncollaborated with the\nReactor Centre, who have\nexperience in working with\nlow levels of radioactivity,\nand the Applied\nGeochemistry Research\nGroup (AGRG) under Dr\nThornton. The AGR G have\nbeen looking at lead levels\nin the environment, and\ntheir experience in\nconducting surveys, and\ndealing with local\nauthorities and the public\nhas proved to be\ninvaluable. The local soils\nin Cumbria naturally\ncontain a low level of\nradiation and the aim of the\nproject was to discover\nwhether any radioactivity\nfound in the build ling resulted from this natural\nsoil radiation, or if it was\ncoming from the sea spray as a consequence of the\nwaste release. The joint\npaper is expected to,come\nout in late December or\nearly January.\nThe group's work also\ncovers the implications of\npollution releases on a European scale; more than\n10 years ago they were one\nof the first research teams\nat Imperial College to gain\nEuropean Community\nbacking. Using\nmeteorological data\nextending over the whole of\nEurope, Dr Apsimon has\ndeveloped computer\nmodels to predict the\ntrajectories of pollutants.\nThese methods, which were\noriginally developed to\nstudy radioactive releases\nand their trans frontier effects, are now being used\nin Germany to study the\nacid rain problems. It is\nbelieved that many of the\ncurrent problems affecting\nGerman forests are caused\nby pollution from other\nEuropean countries, in\nparticular, those Eastern\nEuropean countries that\nburn high sulphur coals. It\nis hoped the studies will\neither provide evidence that\npollution is coming from\nthese countries, or show\nthat the problem results\nfrom vehicle emissions and\nis a much more widespread\nproblem.\nAs our understanding of\nthe interaction between\ntechnological developments\nand the environment\nincreases, it will allow\nmore balanced judgements\nto be made. More\nimportantly, however, this\nincreased knowledge will\nallow us to take steps to\nprotect the environment.\nIPERIAIJ\nCOLLEGE\nRADIO Competitions\nFree Birthday Cake\nFun and Frolics\nFriday 29 November FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Ash Agrees To\nBurgess Plan\nUnion President Carl Burgess\nhas reached an agreement with\nthe Rector, Professor Eric Ash,\nthat will prevent the Union\nlosing control of the Lower\nLounge. Mr Burgess met with\nProfessor Ash and College\nSecretary John Smith on\nTuesday to discuss the Union\nBuilding issue. It was agreed at\nthis meeting that the Union\nDining Hall and Senior\nCommon Room would be\navailable to the Department of\nBiology for use as seminar\nrooms. The Lower Lounge will\nnot be converted into a lecture\ntheatre, as College\nadministration had initially\nintended (see FELIX No 721).\nThe conversion of the\nBotany/Zoology common room\ninto a lecture theatre for\nBiology is to go ahead as\nplanned, however.\nThe original decision to\ntransfer control of the rooms\nwas taken at a meeting of the\nRector's policy committee. The\nUnion was not consulted.\nProfessor Ash agreed to discuss\nthe matter following\nrepresentations from Mr\nBurgess over how the decision\nwas made. IC Union Executive\nmet on Monday and approved\nalternative proposals suggested\nby Mr Burgess.\nMr Burgess told FELIX that\nProfessor Ash and Mr Smith\nexpressed complete agreement\nwith his proposals at the\nmeeting on Tuesday. He had\nsaid that for Biology to take\nover the Lounge would be an\ninefficient use of the room. The\nUDH and the SCR could be\nmade available for Biology to\nuse as morning seminar rooms,\nand it was undesirable to\nduplicate existing facilities.\nProfessor Ash and Mr Smith\nboth acknowledged that the\nLounge was the only room\nsuitable for parties and discos.\nIt was accepted that the Union\nshould retain control of the\nLounge, and should let the UDH\nand SCR to Biology for a minimal fee. These plans will be\nput forward for approval of the\nGoverning Body.\nMr Burgess also presented\nProfessor Ash with a document\nexpressing 'the feelings of the\nstudent body'. He was\nparticularly concerned over the\ngeneral lack of communication\nbetween College administration\nTwenty Flight Rockers playing in the Lower Lounge\nand the Union. Professor Ash\napparently agreed with much of\nwhat Mr Burgess said, but\nadded that there were other\nfactors to take into account. He\nalso described Biology as one\nof the 'up and coming'\ndepartments. He thought that\nthe research projects were too\nspread out and that it was\nnecessary to bring operations at\nSilwood back to South\nKensington.\nOn Wednesday Mr Burgess\nand Deputy President Dave\nKingston had a meeting with\nKeith Garwood, a senior\nAdministrator at Queen Mary\nCollege, to discuss the takeover\nof the Union bar. Mr Garwood\ntold them that the turnover of\nthe QM C bar is \u00a3130,000, and\nits net surplus \u00a320,000. IC\nUnion bar has a turnover of\n\u00a3135,000 and, according to the\nfigures available, a surplus of\nonly \u00a36,500 before overheads.\nMr Garwood said that the bar\nmust be run as a separate\ntrading enterprise, and that the\nrevenue from it could not be\nused to sub sid is e the Union\nsub vent ion directly. He added\nthat refurbishment costs would\nnormally be met by the brewery.\nMr Burgess and Mr Kingston\nare still investigating the\nlicensing arrangements for a student run Union Bar. If a Club\nLicense or a Justice's License is\nobtained it will not be necessary\nfor the Union to obtain a legal\nidentity. The Union lawyer has\nadvised Mr Burgess that a corporate legal identity could\nbe set up for the Bar alone, not\naffecting the Union as a whole.\nThis course of action would go\nagainst the wishes of the\nCollege Secretary. Mr Smith\ntold FELIX last week that he\nwould prefer the Union to have\nits own legal identity in order to\nachieve some independence\nfrom College administration. He\nadded that the Union wil be\nprovided with all the available\ninformation on the finances of\nthe Bar. He was not, however,\nprepared to use staff resources\nto produce more detailed\naccounts.\nThe Union bar floor was\ninspected recently by the\nEstates section It was decided\nthat the floor could undergo a further two sanding s before it\nwould have to be replaced. This\nrepresents an additional\nlifespan of 6 to 8 years. The\ncost of replacement was\nestimated at approximately\n\u00a32,500, an amount which\ncontrasts sharply with the figure\nof \u00a320,000 which had been\nwidely reported.\nFree 29 November 1985 No 723\n\n"

These are\na valuable resource. If the\nonly fault of the current\nsystem was for rooms such\nas LT145 to be\nuncomfortably full when\nother rooms are half empty\nthat would be bad enough.\nHowever both the loss of\nthe under gara duat es' room\nand the planned takeover\nof the Lounge and Bot/Zoo\ntearoom by the Biology\nDept. can be traced to the\nsame problem.\nIf rooms for teaching\nwere shared, with many\ndepartments possibly using\none room throughout a day, then all these\nproblems would be solved.\nInitially only small changes\nto cur r rent patterns would\nbe needed, so\nadministrative effort would\nbe small. However as\nrelative sizes of\ndepartments change then\nmore changes would be\nneeded, increasing\nadministrative effort.\nHowever the savings in\ntime and money would\nincrease too. To have two\ndepart me 'its short of space\nfor teaching when the UGC has criticised Imperial for\nhaving foo much of this\ntype of space is surely\nevidence of in felix i bil it y leading to in eff ice n cy. Three students from DoC\n2 brought this matter up in\nanother context with the\nCollege Secretary on\nNovember 11th, and he\nagreed that central control\nwould solve many\nproblems, that the idea has\nbeen mooted before, and\nthat it had failed due to\nresistance from\ndepartments.\nBut surely now is the\ntime for action. We the\nundersigned in Doc 2 call\non the college to prepare a plan of change to be\npresented at The 5th March\n1986 House Committee and\nimplemented before the\nbeginning of the next\nacademic year.\nWe ask also that you\nconsider lending your\nsupport to the idea, and\nawait your reply.\nLoads of Computing\nStudents.\nCopy sent to FELIX\nPosters\nDear Hugh,\nSadly, last week some\nrather small-minded\nstudent(s) decided to tear\ndown and trample over our\nCND posters entitled 'Can\nRussia Cheat'. Obviously\nsomeone thinks that the\ndefence of democracy and\nour freedom of speech\nmust not be jeo pardi sed by\nanything\u2014including those\nfreedoms themselves.\nTo quote Carl Burgess:\n'Anyone caught damaging\nany society's posters will\nbe sent to a disciplinary\nCommittee who have the\npower to fine and/or ban\nfrom the union'.\nI often find posters\noffensive, for example the\nFCS efforts and some of\nthe more sexist offerings\nthat we've seen recently,\nhowever if I were to do\nsomething about any of\nthem, it would be to speak\nto those concerned.\nIndeed, if someone has a genuine grievance over our\nadvertising literature I would be happy to try to\nmake it more 'acceptable',\nsurely, though, people who\ntear down anything they\ndon't agree with should\nstart asking themselves\nsome serious questions.\nYours sincerely\nMark Herman\nICCND Chairperson.\nThe End?\nDear Sir,\nLast Friday's Guilds\nCarnival has been widely\nacclaimed as one of the\nbest events to have been\nheld in College for a long\ntime. All the different acts\nwere of a consist ant ly high\nquality so that everyone\ncould make the most of all\nthat was going on. In good\nfaith we or gains ed the best\nquality entertainment for a grand finale to Rag week\nwith every expectation of\nmaking a good profit for\ncharity. Professional\nentertain em nt does not\ncome cheap, so we had to\nraise the cost by 50p from\nlast year to \u00a34.00. Was that\nreally too much to pay? Do\nmembers of College want\nTop-of-the-Pops style\nentertainment for the price\nof a cattle-market disco?\nSadly, there were not\nenough people present and\na large loss has been made.\nIn Guilds we have been\nasking ourselves what went\nwong. Publicity in terms of\nposters, handbills and\nFELIX was well covered.\nThe ticket sellers were out\nin most departments and\nthe groups, comedians and\ndiscos were carefully\nselected, so what did go\nwrong? We would like to\nknow.\nAt the moment we will\nhave to assume that\nmembers of College do not\nwant or are not prepared to\npay for good quality ents\nand therefore we will be\nrecommending that similar\nevents do not take place\nagain.\nWe deeply regret the loss\nof union money on this\nventure.\nYours sincerely and\ndespondently on behalf of\nCity and Guilds Union\nRoger Preece\nJoin the\nWorldbeaters\nFlights \u2022 Trains \u2022 Jours \u2022 Accommodat\nSki Holidays \u2022 ISISInsurance \u2022 \\SICCs\nGroupRates'* WeekendBreaks\nULU Travel\nImperial College, The Junior Common Room,\nSherfield Building, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7. 01-581 8882\nA Service of\nSTA\nTheWorldbeaters\n/to\nGOVERNMENT BONDED UNDER A TO L822 IN ASSOCIATION WITH SATA C CHARTER ERS FELIX Friday 29 November 3\n\n"

    "content": "For many students a grant is now a vague memory, either\nspent or down to the last few pounds, time now to think of\nclaiming money over the Christmas vacation. This article\nshould give you an idea of what you can claim and how to\ndo it.\nUndergraduate Students\nThe undergraduate student\ngrant contains an element\nof \u00a327.50pw to cover your\nliving expenses during the\nChristmas and Easter\nvacations. Unlike term-time,\nthere is no element\nincluded in the grant for\nrent over these periods. If\nyou have to pay rent during\nthese v actions, you are\nentitled to claim the money\nback.\nPostgraduate Students\nPostgraduate grants\ncontain living and rent\nelements for 52 weeks of\nthe year and therefore\npostgraduate students have\nno extra eligibility for\nbenefits over the vacations.\nHow to claim and what to\nclaim:\nUnemployment Benefit\nThe calculations behind\nthis benefit are long and\ncomplicated particularly\nover the Christmas vacation\nas the conditions of\neligibility change on\nJanuary 1st. Who is eligible: Anyone\nwho has paid or been\ncredited with National\nInsurance contributions on\nearnings of at least \u00a31689\nin the tax year 1983/84 will\nbe eligible for the entire\nvacation period. Anyone\nwho has paid or been\ncredited with National\nInsurance contributions on\nearnings of at least \u00a31767\nin the tax year 1984/85 will\nbe eligible from the 1st January. If you only\nbecome eligible from\nJanuary 1st DO NOT\nAPPLY IN.DECEMBER, if\nyou do you will be ruled\nineligible and your claim\nwill remain invalid for the\nentire vacation. This is\ncalled the 8 week rule.\nTo claim: Go to your local\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice on the first weekday of\nthe vacation and 'sign on' as\nunemployed and available\nfor work. They will need\nproof of your identity and\nwill need to know your\nNational Insurance number.\nRead on to the section on\nStandard Housing Benefit.\nIt is worth noting that\nUnemployment Benefit can\nbe claimed from any\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice in the area you are\nstaying in when you\nbecome eligible. If you are\nclaiming Unemployment\nBenefit you should be able\nto claim Standard Housing\nBenefit.\n4\ni payment of Certificated\nHousing Benefit.\nThe Term 'householder' is\nloose and ill-defined and\nopen to appeal but\nobviously the DHSS will\nseek to classify students as\nnon-householders if\npossible.\nNon-householders: Most\nstudents living with a landlady/landlord or\nsharing a flat with friends\nwill be classed as non-householders and as the\nliving element in the grant\nis a slightly higher amount\nthan the non-householder\nrate, you will not qualify for\nSupplementary Benefit and\nwill not be eligible for\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit.\nHousing Benefit\nSupplement\nIf you do not qualify for\nSupplementary Benefit, the\nDHSS should still make an\nassessment for Housing\nfee;\n.R<5>R Which method should you\nuse?\nA) Staying in London:\nThere are two methods of\nclaiming rent money back,\nthe one to use depends\npartly on whether you\nintend to remain at your\nterm-time address over the\nChristmas period. The\nfastest and most efficient\nway to get the maximum\namount, if you are eligible,\nis to 'sign on' as\nunemployed with the\nDepartment of Health and\nSocial Security, the DHSS.\nFor payments from the\nDHSS, Certificated Housing\nBenefit, you need to be in\nLondon throughout the\nChristmas period, be\nclassed as a householder\nand be available for work in\nthe area in which you live.\nB) Going Home: However,\nfor those who do not want\nto remain in London over\nthe Christmas break but\nhave to pay rent for a term-time address you can still\nclaim the money back\nthrough Standard Housing\nBenefit.\nIf you have ever been\nemployed: In addition to\nHousing Benefit those who\nhave been employed in the\nrelevant tax year, see next\nsection, may be entitled to\nUnemployement Benefit.\nStaying in London:\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit\nThis form of Housing\nBenefit is only available to\nthose able to 'sign on' as\nunemployed and available\nfor work in the area in\nwhich they are paying rent.\nIt is also dependent on your\neligibility for Supplementary\nBenefit\nTo Claim: Go to the local\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice on the first weekday\nof the vacation and 'sign\non' as unemployed and\navailable for work. If you\nare not eligible for\nUnemployment Benefit\nthen your papers will\nautomatically be forwarded\nto the local DHSS. The\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice will tell you if and\nwhen they want you to\n'sign on' again and will give\nyou form B1 to take or\nsend to your local DHSS\noffice. The DHSS may call\nyou for an interview and\nwill need proof of identity\nand your financial situation\nie recent bank statements\netc. The DHSS pay a basic\nliving allowance and will\nauthorise the local Housing\nAuthority to pay\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit. The Housing\nAuthority will send out\nforms to be completed t'o be returned with proof of\nrent and rates. Payments of\nBenefit are considered a priority and should be\nprocessed within fourteen\ndays, though they rarely\nare.\nThe main disadvantage of\nthe Certificated Housing\nBenefit system is its\ndependence on eligibility\nfor Supplmentary Benefit\nwhich excludes a large\nproportion of students.\nWho will qualify: Students\nnot receiving grants should\nqualify, other students will\nhave to rely on the\npossibility of being\nclassified as a 'householder', by the DHSS.\nThere are two types of\nSupplementary Benefit \u2014\nhouseholder and non-householder. A householder is defined as\nsomeone who is solely\nresponsible for meeting all\nthe costs of their\n'household' and they\nreceive a slightly higher\nrate of Supplementary\nBenefit.\nHouseholders: However,\nsome students living in\nindividual beds its may be\nclassed as 'householders'\nand as the student vacation\nelement is lower than the\n'householder' rate you\nshould be eligible for a small weekly sum from the\nDHSS and in these cases\nthe DHSS will authorise\nlong\nprovide you with slightly\nmore benefit than if you\napproached the Housing\nAuthority direct.\nHow to claim if you are\nleaving London for the\nvacation\nStandard Housing Benefit\nSome of you will hopefully\nalready have submitted\nclaims for Standard\nHousing Benefit during\nterm-term although most of\nyou will still be awaiting the\nresult of your claim. During\nthe short vacation your\nofficial weekly income\ndrops to \u00a327.50 pw and\nthere is no rent element\nincluded in this sum, so if\nyou claim standard\nHousing Benefit over the\nvacation you will receive\nconsiderably more than\nterm-time. Students who\nwere not eligible in term-time using this system\nshould be eligible for some\nmoney back in the vacation\ndue to a drop in income.\nThis benefit doesn't involve\nany 'signing on' and can be\npaid even if you are not\nresident in your term-time\naddress over the vacation.\nTo claim-if you have\nalready submitted a claim:\nIn theory if you have\nalready submitted a claim,\nstating term dates you\nshould automatically be\nre\u2014assessed. In practice\nthis rarely happens. It is\nwise to write to the\nHousing Benefit Office and\nstate that it is now vacation\ntime and that as your\nweekly income is only\n\u00a327.50 pw you wish to have\nyour Housing Benefit\nreassessed for the period\n14th December 1985-5th January 1986. Also inform\nthem that you will not be\nworking over the vacation.\nThey will send you a declaration to this effect,\nfor you to sign.\nTo claim-if you haven't already submitted a claim:\nYou should submit claim\nforms the week before term\nends. Student Services has\nforms for 22 boroughs, if\nwe haven't got the one you\nneed then we can tell you\nwhere to get hold of them.\nWhen you submit your\nform you will need to\ninclude proof of your grant\nfrom your Local Education\nAuthority, proof of rent is\nrent book/rent receipt/letter\nfrom your landlord/letter\nfrom Student Services if we\nare your landlord and a note of your term dates.\nRemember claims will not\nbe backdated so apply\nbefore the vacation, not\nafter.\nas\n<3\n.S Hamlet Gardens\n1 flat for 2 1 flat for 6 1 flat for 8\nShared Single Spaces Available\n\u00a326.50pw plus bills\nhex ham Gardens\nFlats For 5 and 6\nVarious double rooms and single shared spaces Ten minutes walking distance from College.\n\u00a330pw plus\nApplications invited from groups of any\nsize.

    "content": "IC Symphony\nOrchestra\nToday's the day! At last, the\nmusical event for which\nyou've all been waiting\u2014an\nunparalleled and staggering\nevening's entertainment the\nlike of which has yet to be\nseen within College...well,\nactually it's ICSO's Autumn\nterm concert (but some of\nthat pre-amble still applies!)\nSince it's the first concert\nof the new year, we\nthought that we'd tell you a the Orchestra each year.\nWell, that's enough about\nour activities, now for a brief word about our\nconductor, Mr Richard\nDickins. He has been with\nICSO for over five years, in\nthat time the Orchestra has\ngrown both in numbers and\nconfidence. Ever more\noutrageously ambitious\nprogrammes are being\ntackled from The Planets'\n(students) will enable you\nto hear the Orchestra in its\nmost romantic vein.\nTchaikovsky's 'Romeo and\nJuliet' opens the concert\n(It's got a very well-known\ntune.) This will be followed\nby 'The Lark Ascending' by\nVaughan-Williams. It's an\nenchanting work for solo\nviolin and small orchestra,\nbased on the poet y of\nGeorge Meredity. Visions of\nthe English countryside are\nconjured up; it's a very\npastoral and calm piece. In\nthis performance, we are\nfortunate to have David\nJuntz, from the English\nChamber Orchestra,\nplaying the solo part.\nDavid Juntz was born in\nCape Town, South Africa in\n1957 and had his first violin\nlessons at the age of six\nfrom Noel Travers. At\nseventeen he was awarded 4fe a scholarship to study at JJJ\nthe Royal College of Music, DI\nwith Hugh Bean and _&\nJaroslav Vanecet. Whilst\nthere, he won all the major ^5\nprizes for violin and SS\nchamber music including ji\nthe Tagore Gold Medal. * fe On leaving College in\n1981, he joined the English\nChamber Orchestra, and\nhas since appeared as a soloist with them, the\nEnglish Philharmonic and\nmany others. In February\nthis year, he had his South\nBank debut. David plays on\na fine Italian violin made by\nNicolo Lagliano in Naples,\ncirca 1750.\nAfter the interval (to give\nyou time to recover from\nthis wonderful English\nmusic), your senses will be\nstunned by Rachmaninov's2 nd Symphony. It's a large-scale and exceedingly\nromantic work that is\nexciting, poignant, sensual\nand def intel y worth\nhearing!\nICSO are looking forward\nto seeing you tonight\u2014it\nshould be a good concert,\nit will whet your appetite\nfor Mahler's2 nd Symphony \u2014 next term!\nlittle about what the\nOrchestra gets up to, with\nwhom and where, and try\nto entice you to this\nevening's concert.\nImperial College\nSymphony Orchestra has,\nat present, about eighty\nmembers. A good\nproportion of these meet\nevery Wednesday at 7.00pm in the Great Hall for a three\nhour session of blowing,\nscraping, bashing and\ngenerally driving our\nconductor to despair. In\naddition to these weekly\nrehearsals, there are\noccassional repertoire\nmornings when the\nOrchestra tackle a wider\nvariety of music than in the\nyear's concert programmes.\nAn annual event that\neveryone looks forward to\nis the residential weekend,\nheld in the first term. The\nvenue is Silwood Park,\nImperial's field research\nstation near Ascot. This\nprovides a wonderful\nopportunity for new\nmembers to meet older\nones, and to play a great\ndeal of music in beautiful\nsurroundings. In between\nfull re hersal s and much-needed trips to the local\npub, chamber music\ngroups find time to meet\nand get together. It's a very\nconcentrated weekend, but\none which is enjoyed by\nSuite' to last year's epic,\nStravinksy's 'The Rite of\nSpring'. And just wait for\nnext year's monumental\npresentation...anyway,\nback to the Maestro.\nRichard Dickins began\nhis musical training as a chorister (but he soon grew\nout of that). In 1975 he\nentered the RCM as a clarinetist, and the\nfollowing year he was\nawarded an exhibition. It\nwas at this time that he\nbegan his conducting\nstudies with Norman Del\nMar. He left the College in\n1979 having won a number\n(which?) of prizes for both\nclarinet playing and\nconducting.\nRichard's debut was in\n1980 in the Albert Hall,\nsince when he has kept a busy schedule, rushing\nbetween La Scala,\nEdinburgh, Sadler's Wells\nand darkest Exmoor. He is\ncurrently music director of\nthe Minehead and Exmoor\nFestival, and the Covent\nGarden Chamber\nOrchestra. (What the\nwritten word cannot convey\nis the dynamic nature of\nthis man's conducting\u2014it\nhas to be seen to be fully\nappreciated!)\nNow for this term's concert. It's tonight\n(November 29), at 8.00pm in the Great Hall. Just \u00a31\nLEMMING JELLY PRODUCTIONS\nin association with Guilds\npresent\nClje almost &)mter ii> ote tice gig\nplus\nTWICE BITTEN\nMonday 9th December\n8 till 11pm in the Lounge\n\u00a32 on the door\n\u00a31.50 in advance from Jelly\nin the Guilds office, or from\nthe Felix office.\nFELIX Friday 29 November 7\n\n"
