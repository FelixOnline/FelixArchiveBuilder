Seven twenty. London\nwas never this cold. The icy gale\nhurtled through the Western Port\ncar park, and we staggered to the\nwarmth of the ferry terminal.\nObviously the \u00a36 for a day's parking had been used productively.\nWere we sure this wasn't Heathrow? Those Marketing\nExecutives had done a storming job,\nthe compulsory check-in at least\nhalf an hour prior to sailing means\nthat the exorbitant cafe does a roaring trade.\nEventually, we were ushered to\nthe luxuriant interior of P&O's Pride of Dover, and straight into the\nDuty Free shop. What a spectacle\nto behold! Student heaven. I greedily stashed the bounty into the\nabsurdly small basket totting up the\nsavings - Green Chartreuse \u00a38.25\n(instead of \u00a319.95), 200 Silk Cut\n\u00a312.75, a litre of Vladivar Gold\nvodka (57%vol!) \u00a39.75.. Paradise.\nAh. The cash desk. Despite the\nremoval of limits on tax-paid goods,\nthere is still a duty-free allowance.\n'How many people are you\nbuying for?'\n'Oh, loads,' came the reply,\n'honest.'\nYou are allowed one litre of spirits\nand 200 cigarettes per crossing but\nwine is best bought in France.\nMais oui, la France. We're\ncertainly in Europe now. No\ncustoms, no immigration, in fact\nnobody at all. Even the most\ndisreputable illegal or visa-less\nwould have no difficulty strolling\ndown the abandoned corridor to a life of freedom in France.

Except that everyone speaks\nEnglish, except us tourists who are\nattempting what remains of our\nFrench dredged up from those\n'O 'Level days. Why didn't those\nteachers teach us anything useful,\nsuch as how to ask when the bars\nopen, and if we can change our now\ndefunct 10 franc coins into\nsomething more valuable? As if the\ncollapse of the pound isn't painful\nenough. Your pound will only buy\n8 francs, making town-centre prices\ncomparable to the West End.\nout... \u2014 responsible glider pilots showing off their latest trophies\nSo, how about some culture?

There\nis another on the east side of town.\nIts a hefty and sobering stroll if you\ncan survive the maniacal French\nmotorists and non-existent\npavements. No wonder there isn'ta population problem - only the fit\nsurvive into middle age. The rest\ndie from liver cirrhosis. These\nprices are absurd! 50p for a bottle\nof wine. At 12% vol, who cares if\nit tastes like sour mouthwash?\nYou need a plan for the\nHypermarket alone. Continent is\nHarrods for students, and\nimpoverished Sun readers out for a quid. You can buy a TV, coffee set,\nhouse-plants, bicycles, food and of\ncourse booze. Within, the aisles are\nbarren as booze-craved Brits scurry\nto the far depths of the store where\nthe beer is hoarded, well away from\nmore practical goods.

For as much as\nthree pounds, you can buy a superbly rich Merlot or classic\nBordeaux, but take care as French\nsupermarkets do not have as\ndiscerning buyers as at home. The\nproblem of sampling can easily be\nsolved by buying several half\nbottles, guzzling them outside the\nshop and then returning rapidly\nbefore the alcohol has too much\neffect to stock up the rucksack.\nOther bargains include port,\nmadeira and Scotch Whisky, but it\nseems ironic that they should go to\nall the trouble of exporting\nwonderful malts to France just to\nhave us buy it back again for a pittance.

And they accept\nEnglish credit cards.\nCarrying it all proved a handful\n(excuse the pun).

ICU FilmSoc and ICU\nScience Fiction Society both\nplanned to show the film in the\nsame week, and to charge an\nadmission fee for the respective\nscreenings.\nThe confusion over the\nscreenings led to ill-feeling between\nboth societies, neither of whom\nwere happy over the other's decision to show the film. The\ns ld rr nishi ng eventually led to claims\nof copyright infringement. By\ncharging admission fees, ICU FilmSoc was said to be in\ncontravention of an agreement with\nthe film distributors. ICU Science\nFiction Society was accused of\nbreaking copyright laws by\nplanning to charge for showing a video of 'Alien 3'. The dispute was\nexacerbated by ICU FilmSoc's charging both members and nonmembers for admission to a particular film. Both sides\nthreatened to call in the police.\nA resolution was reached after\nthe intervention of ICU officers.\nICU Science Fiction Society will\nnow show James Cameron's 'Aliens', and the Society's members\nwill be allowed into the FilmSoc\nscreening of 'Alien 3', at the same\nentrance fee as FilmSoc members.\nFelix has been told.that, after taking\nlegal advice, ICU also ruled that the\nScience Fiction Society should not\ncharge an entrance fee for their film\nscreenings.\nThe Result of the 'Drink your way\naround the world' competition was\nannounced in Da Vinci's cafe bar\nthis Wednesday.\nThe winner was the holder of\nblue ticket number 208, which had\nthe name Fey Thompson and the\ninternal extension number 4848.\nMinister visits\nThe prize of a voucher worth\n\u00a3178 in air travel, equal to two\nreturn flights to Paris, can be\nclaimed in the Union office from\nDominic Wilkinson. The winner\nmust produce the winner ticket\nbefore claiming the voucher.\nby Gareth Light\nWilliam Waldegrave, the Science\nMinister, paid a private visit to\nImperial College on Wednesday\nmorning. Mr Waldegrave toured\nthe Interdisciplinary Research\nCentre (IRC) for Process Systems\nEngineering. Martin Bell, Mr\nWaldegrave's Private Secretary,\nsaid that the minister wanted to see\nthe centre's facilities, and 'discuss\nthe interface' between science and\nindustry. Mr Waldegrave was\nimpressed with the IRC's 'excellent\napplied research', and 'the\neducation of both Post- and\nUndergraduates'.\nAccount clampdown\nOvens out of halls\nby Jacob And elin Residents of Beit Hall New Hostel\nhave complained this week about\nthe redesign of their kitchens. A new College Estates Division policy\ndictates that grills and ovens are to\nbe omitted when a kitchen is\nrefurbished. This has already\nhappened in the newly refurbished\nHolbein House, although Holbein\nresidents have the use of one oven\non the ground floor.\nThe New Beit Hostel residents\nare only able to use the oven in the\nold hostel, which involves a walk\nacross Beit Quad. The complaints\nof Hostel residents have been taken\nup with the College Housing\nCommittee.\nRaman Kamani, an MSc student\nliving in Beit Hall this year, said\nthat the majority of students were\ndissatisfied with the lack of ovens\nand grills. He added that these cuts\nwere unhealthy, as it meant that\nstudents would be frying more\nfood, and misusing microwaves,\nleading to food poisoning. Mr Kamani did concede that the\nkitchens were otherwise of a very\nhigh standard.\nCollege officials declined to\ncomment to Felix, but said that the\nnew policy would lead to an\nincrease in hygiene and safety.\nby Gareth Light\nImperial College Union has this\nweek ruled that the possession of\nprivate or external bank accounts by\nclubs and societies - which is in\nbreach of regulations - will no\nlonger be tolerated. This could lead\nto college disciplinary action against\nthose responsible for the\nmanagement of accounts in the club\nor society that may be in breach of\nthis rule. All club and society\naccounts are officially held centrally\nby ICU to maintain their charitable\nstatus.\nIC Radio bid stopped\nby Jacob And elin Imperial College Radio's application for funds from the\nImperial College Trust has been\nrefused. The money would have\nbeen used to obtain an FM licence.\nIC Radio had originally planned to\nhave the FM licence for a trial\nperiod around Fresher's Week this\nOctober. An FM licence costs four\nthousand pounds for a two week\nperiod, which includes the cost of\npublicity and equipment. David\nCohen, IC Radio Station Manager,\ntold Felix that the station will be\napproaching other organisations for\nthe money.\nGovernment fails to halt hospital fears\nby A Tseng and D Curry\nThe fate of Charing Cross Hospital\nis still unclear after this week's Government response to the\nTomlinson report. The report,\nwhich examined rational is ation of\nLondon healthcare, recommended\nlast October that the Royal\nBrompton and Royal Marsden\nHospitals should relocate to the\nCharing Cross site, creating a specialist cancer hospital.\nSpeaking to a packed House of\nCommons on Tuesday, Virginia\nBottomley, the Health Secretary,\nsaid that there was 'no financial case\nfor relocating' the specialist\nhospitals to Charing Cross Hospital.\nNew proposals for Charing Cross\nHospital will now be drawn up in\nconsultation with the North West\nThames Regional Health Authority\n(RHA).\nThe decision not to move the\nRoyal Brompton and Royal\nMarsden Hospitals at the moment\nwas hailed by staff and patients at\nboth hospitals. Bill Bain, Royal\nBrampton's Chief Executive, said\nthat the Royal Brompton is\n'anxious' to discuss the organisation\nof medicine in the Chelsea area.\nPart of this reconstruction will\ninvolve the formation of a new\n'Chelsea Health Sciences Centre',\nwhich will include Imperial\nCollege. Mr Bain said the Centre\nwould 'provide the focus for a campus style development, a federal linking of Royal Brompton,\nRoyal Marsden, the new Chelsea\nand Westminster Hospital, the\nNational Heart and Lung Institute,\nthe Institute of Cancer Research,\nand Imperial College'. Mrs\nBottomley said that the\nestablishment of the Centre would\nbe 'the best way forward in the long\nrun', and said that the NHS could\nnot 'sustain extensive overlap or\nduplication in this part of London'.\nThe plans for the new Chelsea\nHealth Sciences Centre builds on\nearlier proposals for a merger\nbetween Imperial College and the\nCharing Cross Westminster\nMedical School.\nThe Government response to the\nTomlinson Report also says that St.\nMary's Hospital in Paddington 'is\nwell sited in relation to its\npopulation'. The Government adds\nthat 'redevelopment of the hospital\nwould have to be ranked alongside\nother priorities'. Sir Bernard\nTomlinson originally said that St\nMary's Hospital should lose 200\nbeds, and part of the Paddington site\nshould be sold.\nOn medical education in London,\nMrs Bottomley said that Sir Bernard\nTomlinson's recommendations\n'were widely supported', and 'are\nin line with long standing policy' of\nthe University of London. Sir\nBernard proposed the merger of the\ncurrent nine hospital medical\nschools to major colleges of the\nUniversity of London, forming four\nmedical 'super schools'. John\nPatten, the Education Secretary, has\nasked the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England to\ntake the merger proposals 'forward,\nworking with those involved, to\nensure that health and education\nchanges march in step'. Mrs\nBottomley added that the Funding\nCouncil would 'consider the issues\nraised in the Tomlinson Report\nabout student numbers in London'.\nThe number of medical students in\nLondon is expected to fall after the\nimplementation of Sir Bernard's recommendations.\nPage 2\n\n"

In some\ncases they spend up to four times\nthe amount they spend on\neducation, health and agriculture\ncombined. These countries also\noften obtain training for their\nmilitary personnel and technology\nto start their own arms industry.\nThe UK is one of the biggest\nexporters of arms, second only to\nthe US.\nThe effects on the importer of this\nIt's a world that seems to belong as\nmuch to the distant past as it does\nto the future, a monastic community\ncomposed of violent criminals who\nare the refuse of the universe. In\nthis society of outcasts a woman\nwould be the ultimate outcast: a troublemaker, a temptation that has\nbeen repressed, a member of\nanother species\u2014an alien. Someone\nto be feared, not trusted,\nparticularly when she tells an\nincredible story about a deadly,\nunstoppable enemy, and expresses\nher own deepest fear: that the story\nmay not be over.\nWe are on Fiorina 161, a lice-infested planet in a distant solar\nsystem. A subterranean mineral ore\nrefinery and a maximum security\nwork-correctional facility, Fiorini\n'Fury' 161 is un habit ed by a community of prisoners who found\nreligion and stayed behind when the\nfacility was evacuated. Into this\nRe-opening news from IC Rifle and\nPistol Club.\nIC Rifle and Pistol Club are soon\nto re-open following the renovation\nof the College sports centre. We\nwill open for business on the first\nWednesday following the official\nreopening\u2014watch Felix for further\nhuge expenditure are devastating.\nWith so little left to spend on the\nsocial services, the government is\nunable to redress the social and\neconomic problems of the country.\nThis leads to increased\ndissatisfaction of the people and the\nformation of reactionary\nmovements which in turn compels\nthe government to increase its\nmilitary power in order to be able\nto stifle political opposition.. .by the\nfurther import of arms. For this to\nbe achieved either the social budget\nis further compromised, or the\ngovernment borrows money and\nincreases its external debts. The\narms trade is then another\ncontribution of the net flow of\nmoney out of the Third World. The\nlargest importers of arms are often\nrepressive regimes ruling in underdeveloped countries.\n(On a more positive note, many\nof the countries of South America\nare only spending a small part of\ntheir budget on arms.)\nmale-dominated world crashes'\nWarrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney\nWeaver) in a malfunctioning EEV.\nBut Ripley has brought another\nunwelcome visitor to Fiorina 161,\nwhose inhabitants have no advanced\ntechnology or modern weapons to\nfight back when the Alien once\nagain goes on the attack.\nLet Filmsoc take you there next\nThursday in our Mech Eng class,\ntype 220, battle cruiser. We took\nyou there many years ago for Alien,\ntwo years ago for Aliens, and now\nyou can see Alien 3 in glorious\ncinema scope and improved sound at\n7.30pm on Thursday 25th. A seat\ncan be yours for 90p( members) or\n\u00a31.90 (non-members) and with\nPeter's Friends, Death Becomes\nHer, White Men Can't Jump, The\nBodyguard and Reservoir Dogs still\nto come this year, membership is a real bargain at only \u00a33.50 including\nfirst film free.\ndetails.\nWe cater for all abilities, from\npeople who have never even shot a water pistol to those who hold\nFAC's and we have a wide range\nof guns from basic .22\" semi-autos\nup to a.44\" magnum revolver and\na brand new .45\" semi auto Glock\nRegional arms races between\nrival neighbouring countries (eg\nIndia and Pakistan) occur because\nneither country knows how much\nthe other is importing (in analogy\nto the former East-West nuclear\narms race).\nAnd then we have the U Ksecond largest arms exporters,\ndedicating a huge part of its\nresearch budget and resources to\ndefence. It organises international\narms exhibitions, to which it invites\nworldwide representatives, such as\nthe Iraqi directory of Armaments\nand Supplies. It claims its\ncustomer's human rights record is\ntaken into account before the\ncontract, but the purchasing\ngovernments are often the most\nrepressive. Whereas formerly arms\nsales by the West often had strategic\ngrounds, motives now seem to be\npurely commercial.\nThe video ends with propositions\nto reduce the arms trade. A UN resolution has already been made to\nOn Monday, we are pleased to\nconclude our Alien binge with our\npresentation of Aliens: Special\nEdition and Alien 3\nAliens: Special Edition is an\nextended version of the classic\nsequel featuring nearly 20 minutes\nof footage previously unseen.\nAmong the reinstated sequences are\nthe colony as seen prior to the Alien\nattack, Newt's parents first\nencountering the face-hug gers and\nalso Warrant Officer Ripley\nrevealing her first name as well as\nthe existence of her daughter!\nAlien 3 is a bleak follow-up to the\nfirst two films, closer in style to\nAlien than Aliens. A beautiful credit\nsequence shows a face-hug ger moving aboard the USS Sulaco, just\nafter the end of Aliens, instigating\na fire and causing the occupied\ncryogenic tubes to be ejected in an\nescape pod. After being woken,\nRipley is forced to fight the Alien\nthat accompanied the tubes, helped\nby the residents of the planet the\npod lands on, the inmates of a desolate penal colony, as the Alien\nfor you to try. We offer full training\nand supervision.\nIn the past all IC members have\nreceived ammunition subsidies\nwhich makes us the cheapest gun\nclub by far.\nset up a register of arms sales.\nFurther, they propose that there\nshould be public information and\ndebate about all arms exports from\nthis country. That arn in is ter of state\nshould be appointed for the control\nand phasing out of these exports.\nThat training of armed forces of\nmilitary regimes should stop. That\nan immediate embargo should be\nimposed on countries at war or not\nmeeting up to stringent criteria of\nhuman rights records and so on.\nBombs that are used destroy\nlives. Bombs that aren't are\ndestroyed anyway. The sooner the\nhuge resources of the arms research\nindustry and the skills of thousands\nof workers are turned to more\nfruitful purposes the better.\nAnother issue related to the Arms\nTrade not developed here is the\nThird World debt, but if you are\ninterested you are welcome to\ncontact ICU Third World First. We\nmeet at one o 'clock in the Upper\nSouthside Lounge on Fridays.\nICSF\npicks them off one by one. A growing threat, literally, is the\nAlien 'hiding in the most terrifying\nplace of all'.\nMembers get in for 50p for one\nfilm or 70p for both. Aliens: SE\nstarts at 6pm in Chem Eng LT1 and\nAlien 3 at 8.45pm. Also this week, we are proud to\nbe holding a presentation by the\nwell-known fantasy illustrator Josh\nKirby. Josh is probably best known\nfor his covers for Terry Pratchett's novels, but his extensive work since\nthe 50s also includes Brian Aldiss's and L Ron Hubbard's. The talk,\nwith many stills, starts at 6pm on\nThursday in Chem Eng LT1. There\nwill also be an opportunity to buy\nhis latest collection 'The Garden of\nUnearthly Delights' and Josh would\nbe happy to autograph those and any\nother books he has illustrated. Entry\nto this event is 50p for existing\nmembers, \u00a31 for non-members,\nwhilst membership (\u00a33) includes the\nfirst 'event' entry (film, talk,\nvideo...) free.\nFor further information keep\nreading Felix or contact Myles WA Davison through the Rifle and\nPistol pigeonhole in the Union\nOffice or through the Physics UG pigeonholes.\nFilmSoc - AliensGun Club\nPage 12\n\n"

It is her plain,\nsorrowful face, self-mocking\nhumour, the moments when we se\nher in full const ume in kabuki play,\nthat make us admire this\nperformance.\nMake sure you will find time\nbefore 6 March to go and see it.\nE Clarici, J Dymott.\n\u2022 Lyric Hammersmith, King\nStreet, Hammersmith tube.

Tickets\n\u00a37.50-\u00a313.\n19 February 1993\n^ >\nTheatre\nGreasepaint\nThis contemporary back-stage\ndrama is set in the tatty end of\nJapanese theatre, the Taishu, or\nvariety show, often described as\nworking class theatre or kabuki.\nFrances de la Tour plays Yoko\nSatsuki, an ageing kabuki actress\nand leader of a Taishu troupe. She\nis rehearsing her invisible company\nfor that all important first night.\nAlthough concerned with a rain-filled sky threatening bad business,\nand the debut of a new actor, Yoko\nSatsuki is rallying her company on\nto one last effort. Sudden\nappearance of the son that she had\nabandoned many years ago, now a successful singer, makes the actress\nwant to res love the agonies of her\npast in an explosive fusion of life\nand art. This all generates an\nextraordinary dramatic tension.\nAnd if that's not enough, the theatre\nis also scheduled for demolition!\nAs the title suggests there is a certain amount of face painting\ngoing on, with Frances applying,\nfrom the scratch, the distinctive\nRobin \u2014 Prince of Sherwood This show is quite pleasant: it can\nbest be described as a pantomime\nsung through to rock-and-roll.\nWhile hardly on the scale of\nPhantom or Les Mis, the costumes\nand set are attractive (though the\ncod pieces are rather overdone!)\nRobin (Mike Holloway) and\nMarion (Liz Curnick) are played\nand sung well enough, but the\nSheriff (Peter Howarth) and\nMorgana (Anne Smith), his witch,\nsteal the show, stalking around the\nstage, and singing their souls out\n(and selling them to Satan) to some\nexcellent music. This is one show\nwhere the Devil has all the best\ntunes!\nIn conclusion: an undemanding\nand pleasant show; maybe not 1st class, but quite possibly a2:1.

The very funny and\nslightly weird style that is present\nin the beginning drains away to\nleave a drab finale that does not suit\nthe characters.\nSeparation\nFull to the brim of subtle meanings\nand complex dialogue, Separation\nis strictly for masters of the English\nlanguage. In the ninety or so\nminutes, Tom Kempinksi has\nmanaged squeeze enough examples\nof separation to make your head\nspin. The actors perform the\nvarious separations almost\nperfectly, except for the panic\nattack which was not as convincing\nas it could have been, although I was captivated for the entire\nduration of the production. But as\nI have said, there is so much that\ncan be read into this play that you\nare left thinking about it for literally\ndays afterwards.\nP.

Box Office 071-373\n3842.\nAnything Goes The 1993 OPSOC production\n'Anything Goes' is correctly\ndescribed in the programme as a song-and-dance show with a little\nplot to stick it together.\nThe cast was mixed. Matthew\nSoame (Sir Evelyn Oakley)\nperformed very well but his\ncharacter was rather un originally interpreted. Laura Hudson (Bonnie)\nwas enthusiastic as a delightfully\ndo zy bimbo and Joanna Trip (Mrs\nHarcourt) was marvellous as an\naging American lady. I must\nmention Philip Hollman (Moonface\nMartin) who carried his role almost\nflawlessly and added a lot to the\nshow.\nThe orchestra was excellent\nalthough at times tended to drown\nout the singers. Gary Woolf (Billy\nCrocker) has good diction as do\nmost of the cast, but I was a little\ndisappointed by Lyanna Iveson\n(Reno Sweeny) who did not project\nher voice well. The chorus numbers\nwere all of very well executed.\nSo all in all, a reasonable show\nworth going to see your friends in.\nStudents get in for \u00a32.50 so go\nalong and allow yourself to be\nentertained.\nDavid Henderson-Begg\n\u2022 In the Imperial College Union\nConcert Hall\nDance\nThe Snow Queen This Hans Christian Andersen fairy\ntale is magically brought to life by\nchoreographer David Bintley.\nPerformed in three acts the ballet\nenchants.

Act II is ten years later;\non the eve of his betrothal to Gerda,\nKay is pierced by fragments of the\nSnow Queen's mirror. In the final\nact, Kay is captured and wooed by\nthe Snow Queen and the scene is set\nin the amazing, sinister palace of the\nSnow Queen.\nThe Birmingham Royal Ballet's dancers give a beautifully inspired\nperformance flowing to music\nbased on a score by Russian\ncomposer Musorgsky.\nA superb production.\nSonia.\n\u2022 The Sadlers Wells, Rosebury\nAvenue, EC1, Angel tube.

I duly informed my fellow\nsabbaticals and only after Mr Holmes's suspension were West\nand Co called in to confirm our\nsuspicions.\nSecondly, it was again our\nGeneral Manager who discovered\nthat Mr Holmes had used the\nStudents' Union credit card for a private trip to Amsterdam, and it\nwas her and not Mr Holmes who\ninformed West and Co. Also you\ndid not report that Mr Holmes had\nbeen 'no confidence d' and therefore\ndismissed from office on 10th Felix 958\nLobotomy\nDear Jonty,\nThe Frontal Lobotomy-o gram\nhad nothing to do with the RCS\nUnion. The first I or any of the\nO 'grams team heard of the Frontal\nLobotomy-o gram was at the Rag\nMeeting. I am disappointed you did\nnot check you got your facts right,\nbefore writing your damning\neditorial. The RCSU fully agrees\nthat the attack was inappropriate\nespecially as the one thing that can\nbe written to PJ Dodd's credit is that\nat least he has the courage to put his\nname on the bottom of this column\n(unlike the author of Beit Back).\nThis year there has been a problem with people impersonating\nthe Hit Squad, or delivering their\nown O 'grams. These actions are\nparticularly reprehensible as Rag\nhas not received any money from\nthe fake hit squad and only a token\ndonation was received for the two\nlobotomies (less than five pounds).\nVarious methods are being\nconsidered to avoid a recurrence of\nthe events, and any suggestion is\nwelcome.\nJonty, you were present when I pinion\n19 February 1993\nentered the Felix Office with a genuine Hand-Cuff O 'gram to\ndeliver. I would be most surprised\nif words such as Brute Force,\nmugging, thugs, or assaulted would\nhave been used to describe what\nactually happened. My recollection\nis that because PJ Dodd refused\npoint blank to participate, we left\nwithout hand-cuffing him or even\nlaying a hand on him.\nI would be lying if I said that I am perfectly happy with the way\nthat all the O 'grams occurred, but\nwe certainly did not display brute\nforce. I am currently producing a set of written guidelines for the\nteam that delivers the O 'grams so\nas to improve the quality of the\nservice. I would like to use this\nopportunity to ask anyone who has\nany complaint about the service, to\ncontact me via the RCS or ICU\nUnion Offices or the Physics\npigeonholes, I promise a prompt\nand discreet response.\nYours sincerely,\nFlemming Heino,\nRCSU Vice President.\nDecember 1992.\nI trust you will print this letter and\nput the record straight.\nAs a footnote, the college itself\nhas now informed the police and\nhave instigated procedures to\nrecoup the money from Mr Holmes.\nYours faithfully,\nTerry Murtagh, President\nGoldsmith's College Students'\nUnion.\nCrossword\nby Sphinx & The Phantom Bandit\nACROSS\nI.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\nFelix 958 19 February 1993\nNam-Pai-Chuan: Kung-Fu\nI would like to start by introducing\nto the readers a brief history of our\nKung-Fu System: Nam-Pai-Chuan\n(NPC) has a very rich weapons and\nforms heritage, eighteen traditional\nweapons and over fifty different\nforms are taught in the system. It\nalso embodies many techniques\nsuch as self-defence, kicking,\npunching, locking (Chi-Na), throws\nand nerve points use.\nThe system was brought to\nEngland by Sifu (instructor)\nChristopher Lai from Malaysia in\n1979. Since then Nam-Pai-Chuan\nhas grown from strength to strength\nand is now well established in both\nUK and Europe. The Imperial\nCollege NPC club has been\noperating for over 8 years.\nCurrently Sifu Lai and Sifu\nGuishard are teaching in Southside\nGym regularly, on every\nWednesday (7.00pm9.00 pm), Friday (7.30pm9.30 pm) and\nSunday (11.30a ml.30 pm). Beginners are always welcome. The\nfairer sex should not feel\nintimidated in turning up since over\n30% of the class is female.\nHaving joined Nam-Pai-Chuan\nthree years ago, I have observed\nmany changes and witnessed the\nprogress of the system. I would like\nto mention some of the worthwhile\nevents. I have been most impressed\nby the dedication of some of the\nstudents from other Universities.\nTwo students from Cardiff and\nWarwick Universities travelled\nregularly (over 300 miles) every\nWednesday to IC to attend our\ntraining sessions. I very much\nappreciate the time and effort that\nthey have invested into learning the\nArt. Incidentally, both of them have\ncontributed a considerable amount\nof effort which accounted for the\nsuccessful establishment of the\nCardiff and Warwick NPC clubs\nback in 1992.\nFurthermore, most of the recent\nqualified instructors have also\nestablished centres around different\nUniversities and Colleges.\nCurrently Nam-Pai-Chuan is in the\nprocess of forming better liaisons\nbetween different clubs. More\ncoordination is expected in the near\nfuture.\nGoing back to the IC NPC club,\nthe experience learnt from the\nprevious years has enabled the club\nto promote Nam-Pai-Chuan more\neffectively on a continuous basis.\nWe have successfully recruited\nmuch 'new blood' during the\nFreshers' Fair and the number of\nregular students has remained high\nsince then. This year the two\ninstructors have accepted the\ncommittee's proposal to support\nsocial events for the club; their\nvoluntary contributions have\nenabled the committee to sub sid is e various social events. A buffet,\nChristmas dinner and an ice skating\ntrip have been organised since the\nThe outdoor club\nstart of this academic year. The\nresponses were extremely\npromising; between thirty to sixty\npeople participated in each of the\nevents. The committee is planning\nto organise more sub sidi sed social\nevents in the not too distant future.\nFollowing the successes of\nprevious years, the highlight of this\nyear's event is likely to be the\nweekend training course. It will be\nheld in Warwick University on\n17-18 April. The course is designed\nfor all levels of student, it involves\nlearning and practising martial arts\ntechniques that require a longer and\nmore focused period. Students are\nintroduced to different techniques\n(basic and advanced) such as Chigung (breathing exercises),\nweapons and animal forms.\nFinally, I would like to sum up\nthe teaching philosophy of NamPai-Chuan System by quoting a remark by MASTER Lai\u2014T am\nstill learning every day.'\nSebastian Chung, Mech Eng 3.\nMost of us stayed in a climbing hut,\novershadowed by the Mountain\nTryfan. Three slept in a little cave.\nMist wafted around the slopes and\nprecipices of the 'Devil's Kitchen'.\nWe set up ropes and began to climb\nthe Idwal Slabs. In places, there\nwere no holds, roughness of jewel-like quartz was the only support.\nOliver found a new route and led it.\nAt dusk, Phil, Oli, Alan, Bob,\nand Dan climbed another part of the\nslabs, meeting the rest of our party\nat 450 feet. We a bse i led down by\ntorchlight.\nMeanwhile, the lazy slouch ers, dos s ers, and rugby players had a lie\nin, tea in bed, cooked breakfast, and\nwalked up the magnificent Central\nButtress of Tryfan.\nWe had an enormous chicken and\nmushroom cha uss eur thanks to\nSimon 'chef Gubbins and spent the\nevening in a pub in Beddgelert.\nOn Sunday, the keen types\ndragged ourselves out of bed and\nwalked up the base of Tryfan in\ndrizzle and gloom. When we\nreached the start of the climb, we\nwere in and above the clouds. Phil\nand Oli led the way, dragging ropes\nbelow them and securing to ledges\non the East face. That made it safe\nfor the inexperienced Bob and Alan\nto squirm up cracks and jump for\nawkward hand holds. By midday, we were into warmer\nweather and the rock was drying.\nThe boulder strewn valley receded\nbelow us. We had 810 feet of roped\nclimbing. We rache d the summit\nwith an hour of daylight to admire\nthe golden clouds that blanket ted the\nhills below us.\nPage 13\n\n"

I think\nthat 3 words is too short. Dilemma.\nAnyway, Casting follows the\nromantic adventures of a fundamentally forgettable woman,\nand her attempts to form a meaningful relationship with a man,\nand at the same time to break down\nthe barriers of credit card limits. It's not great literature of the\nSheakspeare league, and hardly\nranks with Enid Blyton either, but\nit's enjoyable enough to keep me\nreading it, and I 've got a notoriously short attention span. I read it, I like it and then I use it to\nprop up my new graphic equalise r to stop it wobbling around and\nfalling off the stack while I listen\nto loud music and read tacky books\nabout Sex and Shopping in the time\nwhich I could use for studying.\nL. Yates-Davies.\n\u2022 Published by Corgi, price\n\u00a33.99.\nRevenge...is a woman's art\nA short story collection from some\nwell-known and some new authors\n(all female, surprisingly enough)\nincluding Louisa May Alcott, Ruth\nRendell and Muriel Spark.\nRanging from a bizarre four page\nstory to a four chapter period\n'novel', this book has something for\nevery taste. The title suggests that\nthe stories tell of revenge wreaked\nby women. There are in fact one or\ntwo where the man is retaliating.\nIn the introduction, Kate\nSaunders writes 'When love goes\nsour, the nicest people can turn\nunexpectedly vicious.' This is\nhighlighted in most of the stories,\nwhile in the others, the vengeance\nis provoked by family or by class\nconflict. The forms of the revenge\nrange from the violent to the very\nsubtle, from murder to mental\ntorture, from the disturbing to the\namusing. There is something\ndifferent in each one - some keep\nyou guessing until the very end.\nWith the diversity of the tales in\nthis book, I would highly\nrecommend it. And for any women\nplanning revenge - you could use it\nas a guidebook and get some tips or\nideas!\nBland\n\u2022 Published by Pan Books, price\n\u00a35.99\nSaint Peter's Wolf by Michael Cad num Shrink obtains antique silver fangs\nand turns into werewolf, firstly at\nrandom and at night,then at will,\nably assisted by a similar blond of\nsimilar persuasion.\nChrist, not more blood sucking. Yes, it's a werewolf novel and not\na very good one at that. There's nothing especially wrong with it;\nCadnum delivers the ancient story\nwith some aplomb, but we've\nalready met it too many times\nbefore. The attention soon wanders\nfrom the adequate but un involving plot, and we try to remember who\nanticipated Cadnum's devices,\nelsewhere with more style. Modern\nAmerica psychologist faced with\ngenuine archetype - a mythological\nfigure, as large as life on the couch?\nSuzy Mckee Charnas did it much\nbetter with vampires in The\nVampire Tapestry. Foxy lady\nwaylays rational man into\ndream world of lycanthropy, via\ndreams of running free which turn\nout to be all too real? Old hat again.\nIt makes a possible wet afternoon\nbook, and the crap, repeat crap,\ncover art no doubt prejudiced me,\nbut StPW fails on too many\naccounts: there is little horror, no\njoy of discovery, and the light of the\nBleeding Obvious Plot shines\nthrough the back cover to the first\npage, illuminating this slender tale\nas on a microscope slide. Cadnum's probably worth watching in the\nfuture though.\nMr. Skiffy\n\u2022 Published by Arrow\npaperback, price \u00a34.99.\nPowder Burn by Carl Baise n and William D Mot albano Powder Burn by Carl Haisen &\nWilliam D. Motalbano\n\"Powder Burn\" is not what your\naverage, Indy-reading, pseudo-intellectual, Felix book reviewer\nwould normally be ca gh t reading.\nGiven that its two authors boast of\ntheir investigative and foreign\njournalistic backgrounds, one\nwould have expected something\nslightly more than the average,\nhollow thriller that fills the shelves\nat WH Smiths' Gatwick branch.\nThe story is set of several weeks\nin Miami, when Chris Meadows\nin advert ant ly gets involved in the\ncocain-distribution war between the\nCuban-Americans and the\nColumbians. I disliked Meadows\nfrom the start: he's a NIMBY\n\"Anglo\" who spouts intellectual\nidealism s like \"art ought to be\nunfettered by ideology\". His initial\nmoral stance about justice and\nhuman rights soon dissolves into\nsomething more pragmatic when he\nsets out to get 'El Jefe', the Cuban\nboss of the drugs operation (which,\nincidentally, involves having lots of\nsex and cocain on the way).\nMeadows success in infiltrating\nthe distribution mafia and\ndiscovering the real identity of El\nJefe is remarkable, esp the tough cop\nof the story, has spent years trying\nto do just that. (Nelson's most\nmemorable quote is \"Opinions are\nlike assholes - everybody s got one\nand they all stink\").\nEl Jefe's death (at the hands of the\nColumbians, though instigated by\nMeadows and Nelson) calms both\nMeadows and Nelson. It's as\nthough the entire drugs business in\nMiami has really been shut down\nand not, as is most probably true,\nas if just one of Medusa's heads has\nbeen cut off. Overall, not a very\nsatisfying read.\nSamin.\n\u2022 Published by Pan Books.\nImpossible Vacation by Spalding Gray\nSpalding Gray's experience while\nacting in the renowned film 'The\nKilling Fields' gave him the\ninspiration for some of the content\nand title of his first book\n'Swimming to Cambodia'. A collection of monologues it\nestablished his entry into author is m and led perhaps strangely to a book\nabout the writing of his first novel,\nthe above named 'Impossible\nVacation'.\nHis novel strays from his\nprevious writing experience but not\ntoo far as many of the features of\nthe monologue enter in to the\nnarrative form. The story unfolds\nthrough the eyes of the main\ncharacter who relates both scene\nand script as if read from trie most\nperfect diary. Our hero, for that is\nwhat he essentially is, is Brewster,\na small boy beginning to learn about\nlife at the age of five. Based upon\nGray's own childhood and around\nhis family roots in Rhode Island, the\nstory follows the experiences of the\ngrowing boy, his relationship to his\nmentally ill mother and the effect\nof her death upon the next chapter\nof his life.\nA seemingly uninspired and dry\nlead in to the novel transpires to be\nan expert facsimile of the young\nlads thoughts, not the emotion less notes of a technical movie-maker as\nfirst expected. The writing style\ngrows with the maturity and age of\nSpalding's alias, following the\nmis comprehension of family life\ndue to the madness within it.\nFurther, after his mothers death he\nis hurled into a search for an\nunknown quantity. His desire to\nfind it though driving him around\nthe world in a search for a meaning\nto his existence and perhaps a surrogate mother. He encounters\nthe seedy and the sensual, the\naccepted and the not. A huge\nlearning curve of a wickedly fun\nroller coaster coursing through sex,\ndrink and drugs, kinship and\nfriendship.\nManaged without the excess of a trashy best seller, the story is quite\nbeautiful. Exploring life in a simplistic way which brings forth\nsmiles and knowing grins.\nChris\n\u2022 Published by Picador in\nhardback @ \u00a314.99.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nUNION\nEASTER MINIBUS HIRE\nPlease can all clubs/societies have\napplications in for use of minibuses\nduring the Easter vacation by\nFRIDAY 5th MARCH '93, they will\nbe allocated after this date\nPage 1 5\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\n19 February 1993 Felix 958\nRag defence\nDear Jonty,\nI feel that the Beit Back article in\nFelix 957 reflects very badly on\nFelix as a whole. Allowing a hurtful\npersonal attack on a candidate for\nthe ICU presidency, and indeed\neveryone involved with Rag, surely\ndemonstrates poor personal\njudgement. To make matters worse\nthe article was anonymous\u2014plainly\na lack of courage on behalf of the\nauthor. He is obviously too caught\nup in his own spiteful little world\nto notice, or even bother to find out\nthe truth. Anyone who has had any\ncontact with Rag would realise how\nwrong his perception is.\nRag is more than just\nTiddlywinks, Monopoly, Rag\nWeek and being silly. Many people\ninvolved have been part of serious\ncharity efforts before starting\ncollege. Rag at IC tries (and I believe succeeds) to make\nfundraising fun by organising\ncollections at football stadia and\nconcert venues with complimentary\ntickets thrown in; and doing\ncollections with a theme such as\npavement climbs, Cluedo and\nMonopoly etc. It is a serious\nFizzling out\nDear Jonty,\nIt is not my in ten ion to play Felix\nping-pong with the resurrected Alan\nBailey. After this letter I will simply\nlet him fizzle out in any self-satisfying text he may come up\nwith. By the way, although we\ndisagree on certain things, I respect\nthe pains he goes to to express\nhimself, whereas most IC students\njust can't be bothered. I don't think\nI would dislike the guy if I met him,\nunless he's too hyped up to see how\nirrelevant to the world's pain our\ndebate is.\nFirst of all, I studied 20th Century history for three years\nbefore coming here. I'm familiar\nwith the subject of British influence\nin the world for this period, and\nknow how much agitation it stirs up\norganisation which raises serious\nmoney\u2014over \u00a345,000 so far this\nyear which is one of the highest\nstudent totals in the country. Rag\nhas a policy of welcoming everyone\nwith open arms. Over 300 people\nhave collected this year, all of\nwhom were accepted and treated as\na valuable asset. If people don't feel\nwelcome anywhere else, then\nperhaps someone somewhere else\nhas got it wrong. It would be\nhypocritical of us to only accept a cultural elite. On the other hand\nthere is no place within Rag for\nanyone being vindictive and using\nus as an excuse for violent\nbehaviour. The 'Frontal Lobotomyo-gram' was in no way connected\nwith Rag or the RCS, it was carried\nout by for non-Rag mavericks\nwithout the knowledge of myself,\nRachel Mountford or Flemming\nHeino. I would hope that the\ncandidates for Felix Editor in the\nforthcoming elections have a policy\nof printing fact rather than fiction\nand will be more judicious in their\neditorial decisions.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Woodcock, Chem 2.\nMore lies\nDear Jonty,\nWith reference to your editorial\nin Felix 957 concerning 'Frontal\nLobotomy-o grams', specifically\nthe line 'This delightful display of\nbrute force was organised by the\nRCS Union'. I doubt I can get over\nto you how pissed off I am that you\ncan happily write and print such a lie. The 'lobotomy-o grams' were\nwhen discussed. I admire British\ncourage during World War n.I also\nam sickened at the empire's behaviour in the Third World and\nAmerica throughout history. Just\nread a biography of Gandhi to\nunderstand (very revealing about\nBritish attitudes in South Africa and\nIndia), or see the movie.\nWhen the British left Palestine,\nthey were not capable of\nmaintaining peace and were\neffectively thrown out by the locals\n(yes, in part through terrorist\naction). I believe a member of J Soc\nor Friends of Palestine could\nexplain this. It seems they tended\nto maintain peace by using\nweapons, without helping to build\npeace-keeping political\nstructures.. .They are also\nJihad\nDear Jonty,\nWe recently received a letter\nfrom Islamic Soceity (sic) scribbled\nin a furious scrawl and\n'challenging' us to an open debate\non Government policy on the\nMiddle East.\nApparently, our policy has\nresulted in 'a disaster for the\nin degen io us population'. Although,\narmed with my dictionary, I was\nunable to decipher this statement,\nI am led to believe that the gist of\nit is that Islamic Society is not\nparticularly keen on it.\nIt so happens that we are not\nparticularly keen on some Middle\nEast nations' policies towards the\nWest. I won't even mention the\nwanton destruction of countless\naircraft slaughtering many hundreds\nof innocent Westerners.\nNext, their letter informed us that\n'under the Islamic State there was\npeace and security for all citizens\nregardless of creed.' Witness the\nKurds in Iraq.\nI feel a few Jews may be\ndisconcerted by Islamic Society's assertion that 'the current crisis in\nthe Middle East can only be solved\nby the application of Islam to the\nproblems of the region.' Of course,\nnothing to do with, and certainly\nwere not organised or condoned by\nthe RCS Union and you are utterly\nwrong to suggest otherwise.\nI shan't write any more because\nI don't want to turn this into a boring rant.\nI remain your ever loyal servant.\nPaul Thomas,\nRCSU President.\nresponsible 'for many rectangular\n(i.e. wrong, artificial) borders in\nAfrican countries\u2014read about\nLawrence of Arabia.\nAlan Bailey seems to believe all\nThird World conflicts are due to\nlocal fanatics, i.e. not political,\neconomic and weaponry\ncontributions from ex-colonial\nempires. His belief. He can feel\nsuperior to those involved if he\nwishes.\nI didn't express the Falklands\nproblem clearly: why did Britain\npossess them in the first place?\nAnyway, thank Alan for his simple\nand enlightening explanation.\nAlso: there is no obligation to\nremain with the EC if it is that\ndangerous and 'ludicrous', and if\nyou hate all it seeks to achieve. Why\nhistory confirms this may, in fact,\nbe the only way.\nI am pleased that Islamic Society\nrecognised in their letter that\nConservatism is a caring\nphilosophy. I am however unsure\nwhether they intend this as a compliment or an insult.\nFinally, their letter informs us\nthat Islam is a 'complete ideology'\nand advises us 'to take this\nopportunity to examine (it) as an\nalternative.' Zen Buddhism is also\na complete ideology and this one\neven promises eternal bliss to its\nexponents. Despite a concerted\nattempt by the Natural Law Party,\nit is somehow hard to imagine that\na spot of yogic flying each morning\nwill do an awful lot to solve the\nworld's more pressing problems.\nIn conclusion, while graciously\nforgiving the aggressive tone of\ntheir letter we find it difficult to take\nIslamic Society seriously, and are\nnot in the slightest way inclined to\naccept their challenge.\nLong live democracy,\nYours, hoping we don't have to\nspend the rest of our lives in hiding,\nMark Richards\nfor ICU ConSoc.\nG*0*t \u00a3x HAi w t=T> MMvieRie* :\n| The * St*ft KEs Pf r\\<f* ROOM . . . . |\nblock everybody else's plans if they\ndisplease you?\nFinally: a country, a society are\nbuilt on diversity.

I am not\nfocused on intellectual superiority\nas the only value the way you may\nbe, but enjoy bringing into the light\nfanaticism of people believing\nthemselves rationally sound\u2014I'm not (is that what makes me 'an\nundesirable element'?).\nYours peacefully,\nCrocky.\n\n"

The Charter,\nwhich was to have been published\nin ten days time, plans to strip Local\nEducation Authorities (LEAs) of\ngrant and fee paying powers. The\nGovernment proposals may also\nforce students to pay the full\nrunning costs of clubs and societies.\nThe use of Government money for\npolitical societies and the National\nUnion of Students would stop.\nRumours about the content of the\nCharter had already been reported\nin the media, but Felix and The\nGuardian have been leaked the most\ncomprehensive details yet. The\nCharter came before the Cabinet\nSub-committee on Education this\nweek, with the proposals leading to\na cabinet split. Supporters of the\nEducation Secretary's plan for the\nGovernment to central is e the\npayment of \u00a32.6 billion of grants\nand fees were opposed by those\nministers who feared upsetting\nConservative Party supporters in\nlocal government. Despite what a senior civil servant described as\n'chaos', this morning's Guardian\nwill report that the Higher\nEducation Student's Charter should\nbe law for the academic year\nstarting in October 1994.\nThe Charter proposes the creation\nof a single 'unitary' authority for\nawarding grants and loans to\nstudents, and for the payment of\nfees to colleges. Currently, loans\nare paid by the Glasgow-based\nStudent Loan Company, and fees\nand grants are paid by LEAs, or\ntheir equivalents in Scotland and\nNorthern Ireland. It is not specified\nIC Dance Club took most of the\nif the transfer of loan awarding\npowers to the unitary body will lead\nto the winding up of the Student\nLoan Company.

    "content": "Felix 958\nReviews19 February 1993\nHellraiser III Hell on Earth\nWell, here it is. After a hellishly\n(not a snigger please, not a word!)\nlong wait; Hellraiser III surfaces\nfrom the bowels of hell (there I go\nagain!) quietly released amidst the\nmonotony of current movie bore.\nDo you actually remember the\nprequels? Hellraiser I was passably\nhorrific, though mostly\nunmemorable, Hellraiser II was\neven more of the same, a bit more\ns creamy and gory but as with most\nsequels a shadow of its former\nself. Now we have the third and\n(hopefully) final instalment of the\nHellriaser trilogy to join the\nplethora of horror (so they say)\nmovies around.\nAll I can say is why did they\nbother, this has to be one of the\nworst films I have ever had the\nmisfortune of seeing. Those who\nenjoyed the first two in the trilogy\nwill undoubtedly want to absorb this\nclimax, but believe me you will be\ndisappointed. This film could,\nindeed should, have applied for a 'straight to video' release. Yes, this\nis the sort of film for those who still\nfind saying 'milky, milky' funny,\nfor those who get embarrassed\neasily by the words 'Grunties' and\n'Megaphone' and for those who\nthink the 'Wankel rotary engine' is\nsome sort of marital aid.\nPlotwise, it's just another good\nversus evil rant, and that as they say\nis that. This third installment\ndesperately carries on from the\nprevious two, with Pinhead and his\nbunch of ce no bites walking the\nearth again. Their one desire; to\nreclaim the box and liberate\nthemselves from the powers of hell.\nOnly our heroine, a young\nambitious television reporter can\nstop them. The rest is trivially\npredictable. The acting comes\nstraight from Sesame Street\u2014we're\nta ling Oak with a hint of Redwood\nhere.\nAvoid this film at all costs, it is\na travesty, it IS tripe and it's hell\nto watch.\nMario.\n\u2022 All over London.\nBad Lieutenant\nThe Bad Lieutenant is an NYPD cop addicted to crack, heroin and\nal cho hol. His debts force him to bet\neverything on a baseball game.\nMeanwhile he takes out his\nfrustration by sexually harassing\nfemale members of the public and\ngetting high. Later, a nun is raped\nand a reward offered for the arrest\nof the culprits, which he pursues.\nFilmed in the ragged, punk y style\nof Driller Killer, another of Abel\nFerrara's controversial pictures,\nBad Lieutenant views like a documentary but has a sinister rap\nsoundtrack and a solid, moral story\nto tell. Although the LT's depravity\nknows no bounds (eg. mouthing\nobscenities whilst frantically\nmasturbating over two young\nfemale offenders) the film is\nultimately about Catholic virtues -the LT managing to forgive the\nrapists and the dying, himself\nredeemed. Harvey Keitel gives a breathtaking performance - one\nwonders just how far he was\nper pared to go to achieve realism.\nIf you haven't seen a Ferrara film,\nsee this one - you're in for a shock.\nAralia Elegantissima.\n\u2022 Released today.\nA River Runs Through It\nThis one's a tough ie to review...\nwhat some may describe as artful,\nhaunting and beautiful, others may\nsay it's total shite and wonder why\nit was ever made.\nThe cast are absolutely fabulous\nwith great character projection from\nBrad Pitt and Tom Skerritt. If you\nend up hating this film, it will not\nbe due to really slimy acting, but\nprobably due to the storyline. There\nis nothing wrong with it, like in\nsome films where the links are\nflimsy or nothing is really\nexplained, but there may not be\nenough action to hold the bloody\nthirsty among us. I think it hovers\ncleverly between the two extremes\nof deep and meaningful and light\nhearted entertainment, and anyone\nwho dislikes this description, should\navoid this film.\nHarry\nPage 1 7\n\n"

Other\nperformances of note include the\nAnti-Apartheid team who overcame\na Strong looking Iranian team last\nFriday.

    "content": "Editorial\nMindless Violence\nHaving an avid interest in films,\nI have watched with interest the\nupsurge in the old debate about how\ncinematic sex and violence should\nbe portrayed. Reservoir Dogs, Man\nBites Dog and Bad Lieutenant\ngraphically show the darker side of\nthe human condition, but raise\nquestions about how to show it.\nThose who would control what\nwe watch would say that horrific\nacts are prevalent enough in real\nlife. They argue that we come to\naccept violence as part of life if we\nsee it often enough: How can\ncinematic visions of gore do\nanything but encourage the already\ncynical society in which we live? It\nis not too hard to point to evidence\nof murders and assaults, aggravated\nby gla moriz ation by Hollywood,\nand in the week when a two year\nold was brutally murdered in\nLiverpool, justification of any\nnotion of savagery is impossible.\nThe shortsightedness of this view\nis terrifying. Those who voice such\nnarrow-minded opinions dare not\nCat's Eyes\nFLEMming Heino\nWith regards to your letter on page\n5:\n1) You did use brute force and you\ndid lay, not one, but several of your\nclammy fingers on my personage,\nan experience from which I have\nnot yet fully recovered.\n2) You requested complaints, here\nis one: What kind of incompetent\nasshole allows such illegal O' Grams to occur? Since RAG have\ndenied responsibility and your\nbastion president have denied\nresponsibility, who is left to take the\nblame? You are. This leads me to\nanother complaint: Do you know\nhow to do your job or are you\ncurrently taking lessons from last\nyear's RCS Vice President? I hear\nhe was an equivocal half wit and it\nlook honestly at the way they live\ntheir own lives. It takes a tougher,\nmore disciplined mind to look\nhumanity in the eye and paint it in\nred and tooth and claw. How can\nwe deal with the fact that each of\nus is capable of horrific acts, if we\ncannot even admit that it is\npossible? None of the films I have\nnamed paint an attractive picture of\nthe violence this show, but display\ndecay and degradation without any\nof the glossy Hollywood hype.\nHow can we improve human\nnature if we are not honest about it.\nAll acts of censorship reveal a deficiency in the censor, they show\nan inability to cope with life's terror. Even though it is difficult to\nwatch, this brutality should not be\nviewed reprehensibly, but a way to\nrecognize a problem which we can\nthen start dealing with.\nTravel Issue\nThis issue was meant to be a Travel Special, due to poor\nadvertising, a misbehaving printing\npress and sabbatical elections it\nhasn't been very special. Sorry, we\nwill be having another one next\nterm when y 'all are seriously\nthinking about where to travel over\nappears that this seems to be the\ntrend among esteemed members of\nthe RCS.\n3) You also requested suggestions\nregarding the service. Here are two\nsmall suggestions that could help:\n(A) Stop it all together (B) Give a warning beforehand so the victim\ncan prepare for his/her ordeal,\nabout 5 years would be adequate,\nespecially if it involves being handcuffed to the BroadSheet editor.\nSamantha Cox She asked me not to mention the\nfact that she wrote the letter...and\nthat I saw her chatting merrily and\nin a very friendly manner to..., so\nI won't and instead I 'll just say\nHappy Birthday for next week and\nI hope you enjoy the party on\nSaturday.\nLondon Student\nWhy is there a picture of a women\nFelix 958\nthe summer.

But it\nseems that this is not the first time\nthat British law has failed to support\nand recognise the victim of such a terrible crime. And even if this lad\nhad been given the full sentence\npossible it still would have meant\nthat he only had to spend two years\nin a detention centre due to his age\nand supposed good behaviour.\nWhat's worse is that a fully grown\nman still can only be given a maximum sentence of nine years\n(someone correct me if I'm wrong),\nwhereas the victim has to live with\nthe consequences for the rest of\ntheir life. Yes, I know it's the same\nold arguments arising but it always\nwill be until people realise that we\ncan't let the bastards get away with\nit. There is surely only one way to\nprevent a sick minded arse hole from\ncommiting rape again and again\u2014\ncastrate him! Harsh yes, I agree it\nmay be slightly extreme but it's the\nonly way to be sure.

It felt like a long march\nto my crucifixion as I plodded\nlaboriously upwards, straining\nthrough the tubing to see where my\nfeet were landing. If I stopped to\nlook and think I could not go on -so I tried not to look upwards at\nwhere I had to climb - to the ridge\n3000 feet more above my ant-like\nform.\nAs the third hour of the bike\nbalancing climb passed, I began to\nsee the futility and pointlessness of\nmy goals - but I refused to tell the\nothers. 'Why don't you just carry\na sac of rocks up' said Stephane, 'It\nwould be just as useful.'\nMy strength and stamina was\nebbing away fast as we neared our\nbivouac site at just after 5.00pm. It\nwas a large damp overhang on the\nnorth wall of the gorge, with some\nspartan vegetation for the mule in\nfront. We found a dry corner to\nsqueeze into at one side. Bill busied\nhimself collecting brush for a fire\nand we squatted, feeling sorry and\ncold, wondering where Bill was\ngoing to sleep in his T shirt and\nbroken shoes.\nStephane got some water boiling\non his stove and we tucked into our\ndehydrated meals - dunking bread\ninto bolognaise sauce. Bill squatted\nlike some sick canary perched on a rock - watching us feast with\ncontempt. We gave him some bread\nand cheese which he munched\ndiscontentedly. He spoke b early any\nFrench and a strange Berber dialect\nwhich made all conversation very\ndifficult. When ever you gave him\nanything he said 'Oui' and ate it -his single yellow tooth working\nover time. When he chewed his\nwhole crew-cut, bony head moved\nstiffly, joining in to help the tooth.\nBut he looked like a cartoon rodent\nfreshly emerged from hibernation,\nwith sunken eyes, nibbling on his\nfirst meal.\nWe made him some tea to follow.\nWhat goes up...\nHe guzzled this down and then\nquickly checked the time we wanted\nto start in the morning. 'Sept he urs' he seemed to understand and then\nhe was gone into the night with the\nsinging of s cree cascading\ndownwards after his broken shoes.\nThe night was long and chilly and\nlumpy on our slope in the cave.\nGoats and sheep trickled past in the\ndusk, setting off rock falls. Passing\nshepherds sang sad echoing songs\nand their wolf like wild dogs\nserenaded them in this vast\nbottomless echo-chamber that was\nour home.\nDawn after 6.00am couldn't have\narrived soon enough. I woke\nwanting to be crucified on my bike\nframe rather than carry it up another\n3000 feet to Toubkal's summit. It\nwas still bitterly cold in our shady\ngorge and the black and white of\nshade chilled the rocks and all that\nchose to live on them. Like lizards\nbefore dawn we were sluggish to\npack up and more sluggish to eat\nour cold breakfast of bread and jam.\nBill arrived at four minutes to\nseven, without a watch, totally\nunaware of the time to the point of\nbeing blas e about his punctuality. I left the others to pack and went to\nretrieve my crucifix, which I laughingly called a bicycle, from\nunder a rock nearby. The start of\nthe climb was slow again, my legs\nwere numbed and cramped from a night in the lumpy ^cave and I was\nnot getting any satisfaction from my\ntoil. The wall above me seemed\nhigher still and so impenetrable. My\nurge to climb Toubkal was failing\nme - it suddenly seemed a pointless\nexercise and I had no will to do any\nmore.\nIt was an hour before the others\ncaught me - Bill blowing past with\nall the bags, mats and sleeping bags\nand a childlike urge to show us all\nToubkal, his mountain like a piece\nof work he had proudly finished\nonly moments before. The gorge\nwalls tightened to a spout of chilly\ngrey rocks shattered by a millenium\nof frost and fire. Black rain clouds\nbrewed and squirmed across the\ntops like racing juggernauts and a harsh wind numbed already\nsenseless hands and cut through our\ncotton trousers. We were not\nprepared for such meteorological\nadversity.\nThe path finally spluttered to\ndeath with as cree choked pile and\nBill sitting amidst the luggage\nshivering like a sick old person. I wrapped him in my orange cycling\ncape and his toothless grin popped\nout through the head hole,\nchattering from the cutting wind.\nWe dumped all the luggage and I gladly left the bike with it. The last\nday and a bit of struggling under the\nbike had sapped everything I had\nPage 8\n\n"
