    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday January 9th198711 \"New York, New York\", \"The\nColour of Money\", \"Raging Bull\"\nThe Scorsese Album The National Film Theatre has\ncompiled a season of films detailing\nthe career of one of America's foremost directors, Martin Scorsese.\nIt runs all through January and\nincludes thirty-one films, the eleven\nthat he has directed, many others\nthat he has worked on and some\nthat Scorsese requested to have\nincluded as, although he was not\ninvolved in their making, they had a great influence on him. The variety\nof subjects on show is huge, from\nmusicals to documentaries, hard\nbiting comedy, biography and\nwesterns.\nScorsese is an American of Italian\ndescent who grew up in the violence\nof the New York ghettos. One of his\nearliest successes, Mean Streets, was\nlargely based on his boyhood and\ntraces the lives of Hoodlums\ndesperate to climb up the ladder of\ncrime to Godfather status. It was a small-budget, independently made\nfilm, in a realistic style that truly\nbroke new ground for American\ncinema in 1973. Scorsese was lucky\nto find an actor with whom he could\ncollaborate successfully at this early\nstage, Robert de Niro. De Niro is the\nultimate method actor, he does not\nimitate the character he is\nportraying but becomes him, not\nonly on the film set but in everyday\nlife. Their next film together, Taxi\nDriver, is the story of a psychopathic\nkiller, obsessed with a young girl,\nwho believes that it is his mission to\nclean up the streets of New York.\nThe film has been criticised for its\nexcessive violence, but it has now\nreached cult status, and is certainly a remarkable attempt to look into the\"\nmind of a mad-man who sees\nhimself as being above society.\nNew York, New York was a complete change for both director\nand actor. It is a pastiche of the great\n40's musicals where De Niro is a stubborn, self-centred musician\nwho marries singer Liza Minnelli.\nHe is unable to understand that his\nwife wants to make decisions about\nher own life and so walks out of their\nstormy relationship. He then cannot\ncome to terms with why his ex-wife\nbecomes a star but in amongst the\nrows and hurt there are some\nbrilliant jazz numbers and Minelli\nsinging the original version of \"New\nYork, New York\", which was\nwritten for her anyway, and when\nyou hear it you can understand why!\nRaging Bull was made three years\nlater. It is biography of ex-world\nboxing champion Jake La Motta.\nDe Niro trained for months so that\nhe could do the fight sequences, by\nthe end he was reckoned to be one of\nthe best Middleweights in America\nand could easily have gone\nprofessional. However, he then put\non 561bs to play the boxer as he\ndegenerated after losing his title. It is\nmore about the boxer as a person\nthan the sport, and was shot in black\nand white to add to the intensity. It\nwas deservedly heaped with awards.\nKing of Comedy is, again, about\nthe degeneration of a man as he tries\nto find success. De Niro plays a terrible stand-up comedian and\nJerry Lewis (who really is a comedian) is a hard-nosed chat-show host. In a desperate attempt to\nget on his show, the comedian\nkidnaps the host and although the\nresult is extremely funny, at the end\nthe audience is left with a sense of\ntragedy rather than comedy. When\nreleased it became Scorsese's only\ncommercial and critical flop but it is\nnow being recognised as a brilliant\nexample of how laughter is so often\nused to hide lon lines s and pain.\nIn the early 70's there were a number of films made of rock\nfestivals and tours and Scorsese was\ninvolved in some of the best.\nWoodstock is a recording of the\nfestival in summer 1969, and\nincludes footage of many of the\ngreats of the 60's; Hendrix, Joplin,\nThe Who, etc. Woodstock was the\nclimax of the dreams of a decade\nwhere as in contrast Medicine Ball\nCaravan, made only two years later\nand conceived -as a sequel to\nWoodstock, saw it all falling apart,\nbut there is some great music\nnon the less. Elvis on Tour was made\nat the same time as Medicine Ball\nCaravan but it shows Presley at his\npeak, on the road before his rapid\ndecline. The latest film in the whole\nseason is the recently released Round\nMidnight, set in the wonderfully\nseedy Paris jazz club of the 1950's. Scorsese actually acts in this, but the\nplot is unimportant; the gorgeously\nmellow jazz stands by itself.\nScorsese's latest two films as\ndirector are on show as well. After\nHours is a hilarious yet chilling black\ncomedy, in which a man survives a living nightmare, marooned, alone\nand penniless one night in\nManhatten, with most of the very\nweird population trying to kill him!\nThe Colour of Money stars Paul\nNewman and is a sequel to The\nHustler, made 25 years ago. It has\nyet to be released in this country but\nwhen it does it is likely to be a huge\nhit.\nScorsese has frequently been\naccused of relying too much on his\nbackground of underground life in\nNew York, and of the guilt that\nseems to result from the staunchly\nCatholic upbringings. His off-hand\ntreatment of women in his films has\nalso been attacked. However, with\nexperience and maturity this has\nchanged, and anyway it seems\nnatural that, in order to obtain the\nsort of realism that Scorsese seeks,\nhe should work from his own past\nexperience. What is undeniable is\nthat Scorsese's films work on every\nlevel \u2014 they provide good\nentertainment as they always have\nexcellent scripts, storylines and\nscenery, but at the same time are\noriginal and highly intelligent. He\nalways works on low budget and\ndoes not rely greatly on commercial\nsuccess or failure, and consequently\nmakes the films he wants to make.\nHe is a unique director and The\nScorsese Album is going to be one of\nthe major film events of 1987. If you\nhave never seen a Scorsese film\n\n"

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday January 9th19872 University\nSector Should\nGo Alone\nDear FEUX.\nAs an undergrad ute at IC I voted\nfor the re affiliation to NUS in the\nlast referendum. However my\nexperiences with NUS as a postgraduate at Sussex University\n(including being a delegate to the\nannual conference and a member of\nthe local NUS area council), leave\nme with some sympathies for\nAlastair Seymour's views (FELIX\n757).\nOne point he missed is that many\nof NUS's members are not from\nuniversities, but from polytechnics,\nfurther education colleges and even\nsixth form colleges. The level of\nstudent involvement in union affairs\nis much less at these institutions,\nthus they form an easy way for\nunrepresentative groups to infiltrate\nthe NUS. This was quite obvious in\nthe conference I attended where the\nfar left was much more domine nt at\nfull sessions than at the seperate\nuniversity sessions. In my local area,\napathy, the naivety of many young\nstudents, and the difficulty of\norganising over a dozen or so small\nColleges, meant that the full-time\npost of area organiser was used by a member of the militant ten dancy to\npursue his own political ambitions.\nEven at the university, NUS\ndelegation elections were treated\nmerely as political beauty contests.\nMost candidates used them just to\npromote their own views which had\nlittle to do with NUS or to make a name for themselves before internal\nsabbatical elections. NUS conference itself was largely a slang ing match between the two\ncompeting groups in the Labour\nparty. Since delegations are forced\nto vote for Union Policy (ie anything\npassed at aUG M perhaps by 51 % to\neven if, as in my case, they\nwere elected on a platform of\nopposition to it, NUS's claim to be\ndemocratic because delegates are\nelected on a cross-campus\nproportional representation ballot\nlooks a little hollow.\nHowever, I feel there is still a place for a national student\norganisation, and rather than ignore\nNUS, ICU should be making\npositive criticisms. Firstly\nattempting to bring all students\ntogether in a single union does not\nwork. It would be better to have a seperate university students\norganisation which could decide\nwhether or not to cooperate with\nother sectors. Secondly, the\nunwieldy bureaucratic structure\nshould be completely broken down.!\nThe emphasis should be on the\nnational organisation providing ,\ninformation and resources for its\nmembers, rather than on\ncampaigning and 'making policy'\nfor itself. Thirdly, a complete review\nof all democratic procedures should\nbe made, with a particular emphasis\non ensuring that all members have a' fair chance and not just those with\nthe backing of well-organised but\nunrepresented political groups.\nYours Sincerely,\nMatthew Huntbach,\nLife Member, ICU.\nCouncil\nReport\nSlated\nDear Dave,\nWith reference to the article titled\n\"Stick of Rock\" in the FELIX\nChristmas issue (FELIX 757), I would like to correct the author of\nthe said article on several\nmisrepresentations of fact which\nwere made. Most of the inaccuracies\ncentre about Mr Ian Howgate and\nhis behaviour at the IC Union\nCouncil meeting of Monday\nDecember 8; as FELIX articles do\nnot carry 'by-lines' I do not know\nwho wrote the article, but I sincerely\nhope that these errors were not\nincluded simply because the author\nhappens to dislike Mr Howgate.\nMr Howgate was not upset by the\namount of mundane business on the\nagenda. All Council members, Mr\nHowgate included, realise that\nCouncil must deal with a certain\namount of mundane matters if the\nUnion is to function properly. What\nhe did object to, however (and in\nthis he has my full support), was the\nfact that some of the minutes to be\nconsidered and approved by\nCouncil had only been available to\nCouncil members at the start of the\nmeeting. Normal Council policy is\nto circulate these minutes at least a week in advance so that they can be\nstudied carefully, and Council\nmembers can prepare an effective\nand well thought-out case should\nany matters arise from those\nminutes. With the minutes being\ndistributed only at the start of the\nmeeting, it was impossible to study\nthem properly in order to approve\nthem, and it was this that Mr\nHowgate and other Council\nmembers objected to.\nSecondly, Mr Howgate did not\nobject to Mr Fish's report on the\ngrounds of his absence. Mr\nHowgate correctly pointed out that\nthere was little point in discussing\nMr Fish's report if Mr Fish was not\nthere to answer questions on it.\nAnother Council member put\nforward the ridiculous idea of\nputting those questions to Mr Chris\nMartin, simply because he too was a PG and happened to be at the\nmeeting.'Mr Martin naturally could\nnot answer the questions, so Mr\nHowgate suggested deferring\nconsideration of Mr Fish's report\nuntil such time as Mr Fish was\npresent. It was at this point that the\nICU Deputy President told Mr\nHowgate not to be so \"babyish\";\nthis was, in my view, not a very\nconstructive or substantiated\naccusation.\nMr Howgate suggested that since\nthe Academic Affairs Officer was\nabsent, his report too should be\ndeferred for later consideration; it is\na giant leap from the truth to say\nthat \"Mr Howgate also proposed\nthat all of the minutes of Council\nCommittees such as Internal\nServices and Academic Affairs be\nrejected as well\", as stated in the\naforementioned article.\nLastly, I would like to say that at\nno time did Mr Howgate blame\nUnion publicity for \"the failing of\nmost events this year including\nGuilds Carnival and Rag Carnival\".\nThis is a ludicrous suggestion\nbecause:\ni) Most events this year have not\nfailed.\nii) City and Guilds College Union\nis responsible for the Guilds\nCarnival publicity.\niii) There has been no such thing\ncalled Rag Carnival.\nWhat Mr Howgate did suggest\nwas that the running of IC Union\nPublicity could possibly be\nimproved by making more use of\nSoc. Reps.\nI hope this sets the record straight\nas to what happened at the last\nCouncil Meeting.\nYours sincerely,\nAlastair J Seymour,\nElec Eng Dep Rep\nShallow\nPolicy Of\nElectioneers\nDear Dave,\nOnce again it is the time of the\nacademic year when potential\nUnion Sabbatical candidates start\nto corner innocent bystanders and\nbore them to death with tales of\nSouthside Security and College\npolicy. This is to be expected. What\nis not to be expected is personal\nattacks on other students, who, out\nof goodwill, put a lot of time and\neffort into the smooth running of\nthe Union.\nI refer, of course, to Ian\nHowgate's attack on Chas Jackson,\nthe Union's publicity officer. Chas\nspends a lot of time making and\ndistributing the posters you see\naround College advertising events in\nthe Union Bar/Lounge and in the\nUnion Building. Despite all his hard\nwork, Chas could not escape the\nruthlessly efficient Howgate election\ncampaign. At ICU Council at the\nend of last term, he blamed the poor\nturn out to Union events on bad\npublicity, and, sup rises up rise, suggested setting up a committee to\nlook after this side of things. I can\nsee it now\u2014\"Vote Howgate for\nPresident\u2014the man who sets up\ncommittees\". Pass the bucket.\nIt is sad that the dog-eat-dog style\nof electioneering seems to have\npermeated down to ICU. Let us\nhope those who vote in the next\nsabbatical elections can see through\nthis shallow policy.\nYours in self publicity, Pete Wilson,\nDoC III.\nFELIX News\nMisleading\nDear Dave,\nI must strongly object to an article\nthat appeared in FELIX 757 (page\n5) on the grounds that it was neither\nobjective nor genuine news. I was\npresent with Mr Howgate at the\nmeeting concerned as a deputy from\nthe AAO, Dave Lowrie, and apart\nfrom myself, only one other\nindependent observer was present\nwho was not a FELIX journalist.\nTherefore, the article must have\nbeen written by a member of the\nUnion, hardly objective journalism\nas the vindictive tone of the article\nwent on to prove. The article was\nmore of a personal opinion, and as\nsuch should have appeared in the\nletters section, and not in the news\nsection, and it should have been\nsigned. For these reasons the article\nwas rendered misleading to the full.\nMay I explain further. Firstly, the\narticle said that \"Mr Howgate\nobjected to Mr Fish's report on the\ngrounds of his absence\". This is\ntotally misleading, and deliberately\nso. Secondly, Mr Howgate did say\nthat he was \"upset the the paper for\nCouncil members were circulated\nlate\", but he did not \"criticise Union\npublicity as being responsible for the\nfailing of most events this year,\nincluding Guilds Carnival and Rag\nCarnival\". Most people, Mr Howgate included, know that\nseveral factors account for the\nfailure of events and so it would be a ridiculous statement to make. The\nauthor of the article very cleverly\nruns the two previous au ote s together, attempting to lerida certain absurdity to the former of\ncontinued on page 4\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs. FELIX, Friday January 9th198712 Balloon Club On the first weekend in January the\nannual 'ICICLE Hot-Air Balloon\nMeet' is held near Newbury. Being\none of the largest of such meetings in\nBritain (over one hundred\nballoons), it is often attended by the\nCollege Balloon Club. This year\nbeing no exception, ten of us met in\ndrizzly London on Friday, loaded\nup the balloon and set off in the van,\nkeeping our fingers crossed that the\nweather would improve over the\nweekend. Sleeping arrangements\nwere simple; we crashed out at\nTony's( a local pilot and good friend\nof the club).\nSaturday morning and we were\ngreeted by perfect weather\u2014\nsunshine, blue sky and little wind.\nWe arrived at the take-off field to\nfind that the spectators had arrived\nearly, creating quite a traffic\njam\u2014this was quickly avoided by\ntaking a one-way the wrong way! By\n9 o 'clock about twenty balloons,\nincluding ours, were inflated and\nready to go. Richard and Markus\n(trainee pilot) flew first with Mike\n(pilot), the rest of us chasing the\nballoon in the van (the infamous\nretrieve). After a safe landing, we\nwent to have breakfast at lunch-time\n(not uncommon to balloonists) and\nby 2 o 'clock we were ready for\nanother flight. This time, Wayne\nand Jan (me!) flew, with Mike\npiloting again. To fly at 3,000 feet\nand watch the world just float by is\nan experience difficult to\ndescribe\u2014exhilarating is to put it\nmildly.\nMinor mishaps included \u2014\nMike's bobble hat, Eddie's brain\n(lack of), Markus's long arms,\nWayne asking directions and Claire\nfinding somebody in the bath. Apart\nfrom these, the weekend was a great\nsuccess and seeing over one hundred\nballoons take-off together was an\nabsolutely breathtaking sight.\nTo see photos from this trip, or to\nfind out more about ballooning,\ncome along to one of our regular\nThursday meetings (Southside at\n1.00pm) \u2014all welcome!\nTrip To Paris\n30 students from Imperial College\nare to visit Paris as guests of students\nat the Ecole Superieure de Physique\net Chemie Industrielles de la Ville de\nParis on the weekend of January\n29th \u2014February 1st. In return, 30\nFrench students will visit London\non the weekend of 20-23 March.\nThis exchange will involve\nvisiting the French college and a French company, lots of social ising, culture and sport. It is an excellent\nopportunity to get to know how\nFrench students live, and to try to\nget addresses of where you can stay\nin France.\nThe cost of the travel is about \u00a335,\nthe accommodation will be free\n(French students' flats) and\nentertainments will be extra. The\nOld Centralians have given us \u00a3300\ntowards the trip, other donations\nmay follow.\nThe students who go to Paris will\nprovide accommodation and help to\nentertain the French students when\nthey visit London.\nIf you are interested in a cheap\nweekend in Paris to unwind in the\nmiddle of this term, then this is for\nyou. Contact Richard Murray,\nChem Eng letter racks by January\n13th. Science\nFiction\nIn our continuing efforts to bring\nyou science-fictional edification and\ndelectation from all possible\nsources, and our ongoing quest to\nrender our articles increasingly\nobscure and erudite (eh?-Ed), I bring\nyou glad tidings from the hallowed\nhalls of ICSF. To celebrate the start\nof a new year and in some way\nsignify our headlong rush to the\nmillenium, we shall present two\nauspicious events in the\nforthcoming week.\nFirstly, on Friday January 9th in\nthe Union Building from 7.30 (check\nposters for details) we shall be\nshowing the complete Hitch-Hikers\nGuide to the Galaxy television\nseries, and then on Tuesday 13th January at 7.30pm in ME220, we\nshall show the celebrated\nVideodrome to the unsuspecting\naudience. Directed by Dave\nCronenberg, whose latest film, The\nFlag, has received enormous praise\nfrom SF and mainstream critics\nalike. Videodrome stars Debbie\nHarry and shows what a world\ndominated by cable TV corporations might be like. Again\ncheck posters for details.

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday January 9th19874 continued from page 2\nthe two. Creative journalism,\nperhaps! Misleading and totally\nsubjective, yes. The very fact that an\narticle entitled 'Stick of Rock',\nsu posed ly reporting on an ICU\nmeeting concerns itself almost\nentirely with one man (Mr\nHowgate), who was present for less\nthan half the meeting, proves my\npoint for me.\nPerhaps Mr Bob Kinghorn, head\nof safety in the Geology department\nshould have the last word on the\nmatter. In an article entitled\n'Slinging The Shit' (page 4), Mr\nKinghorn retracted what he had\nsaid because he did not \"trust\nFELIX to quote him accurately\".\nSincerly Yours,\nThomas Daniel Brandon.\nSlanderous\nMaterial\nDear Dave,\nI feel it is outrageous to allow\nsomeone deeply involved in a piece\nof news to write the news article on\nthat event. If Mark Cottle wishes to\nwrite slanderous material about me,\nI suggest he put it as a letter or\nopinion article with his name at the\nbottom of it and come out of hiding\nfrom behind the skirt of FELIX.\nYours,\nIan Howgate.\nDear FEUX,\nSeveral people have commented\nto me in emotional terms upon the\narticle in the Christmas FELIX\nabout Ian Howgate's behaviour at\nIC Council. I feel, in the light of the\ntirade being planned against me by\nthe Howgate publicity machine,\nthat I must defend myself.\nNormally it would be up to the\neditor to defend the news content of\nFELIX, but as Mr. Howgate and\nfriends appear to be mounting a personal campaign against me, I feel\ncompelled to stand up for myself.\nFirstly, I would like to say that I stand by what I wrote as a representation of what went on; the\nonly bits of the article I am not\nresponsible for are the headline and\na couple of small editorial cuts\nwhich may change details but do not\naffect the gist of the item. I do not\npretend to understand Ian\nHowgate, and I cannot say what the\nreal reasons for his actions are.\nWhat I did was write what he\nappeared to say and do. He certainly\nmade a scathing attack on Union\npublicity which showed little\nunderstanding of the problems\ninvolved and later, when I challenged him, took back some of\nhis attacks on specific people.\nOn the matter of Mr. Howgate's objections to reports and minutes, it\nwas very difficult to determine\nexactly what his arguments were, as\nhe seemed to have a new one every\ntime he opened his mouth. I would\naccept that it is bad that all the bits\nof paper were not circulated in\nadvance, and it is unfortunate that\nevery single member of Council was\nnot present to be quizzed on their\nactivities. But honestly, this is the\nreal world; at least if someone takes\nthe trouble to write about what they\nhave been doing, Council should\nhave the decency to acknowledge it.\nIt seemed to me that Ian was arguing\nthat the meeting should be simpler\nand more relevant, whilst at the\nsame time arguing that everything\nshould be referred back and creating\na lot of pointless wrangling.\nIf Ian had really wanted to object,\nhe could have asked for a vote; he\ndidn't. My suspicion is that Ian\nstormed out because he knew that\nhe was not going to get his own way.\nFurthermore, I believe his actions\nhave all been largely in the cause of\npromoting Ian Howgate.\nI first encountered Ian in\nSouthside last year, when he was in\nconflict with Carl Burgess, and on\nthis occasion I strongly supported\nhim. The difference between then\nand now is that last year's Executive\nwere entirely incompetent, while\nthis year's are trying to pick up the\npieces. At the very least I would\naccuse Ian of being over-ambitious\nand naive in his attempts to become\ninvolved in every aspect of the\nUnion. I support Mr. Howgate's gut\nfeelings, but I think the way that he\ngoes about some of his campaigns is\nincompetent, especially his dealing\nwith committees where he faces\nopposition.\nThis, then, is my view of Ian\nHowgate in order to clear up the\nposition of my bias. As for other\npeople's bias and objectivity, I would suggest that every one of us is\nbiased in his own views. I do not\nbelieve that any of us is an objective\nobserver; take heed Howgate\nlackeys.\nI must defend FELIX in the\ncurrent circumstances. This last\nterm has seen Dave under extreme\npressure while setting up the new\noffice, especially as the contractors\nfinished late. FELIX news requires\nstudents to write it. These are by\ndefinition involved to some extent in\nwhat they are reporting. I wrote the\nCouncil report at short notice, as\nsomeone who was present, and\nseveral other Council members\nbacked up the gist of what I wrote\nwhen I discussed it with them. Dave\nJones took our collective word. The\nsingle quote that I used was entirely\nauthentic.\nIf Ian Howgate and friends wish\nto find convenient targets for their\nself-publicity campaigns, they\nshould look elsewhere. For myself, I am entirely disillusioned with\nstudent politics and am no longer a Council member. I will thus not\nhave to suffer any more endless\ncommittees full of self publicists. We\nlive in a dream world here, and the\nsooner I leave it, the happier I will\nbe.\nMark Cottle\nStudent Services\nReshuffle\nThe Student Services Office in\nPrinces Gardens existed for a relatively short period, and in that\ntime neither of the men who have run\nthe service have been particularly\npopular. There has always been a conflict of interests between the\norganisation of College accommodation and the welfare service. As\nStudent Services Officer Michael\nArthur, now College Assistant\nSecretary, put a lot of work into the\naccommodation side, but was heavily\ncriticised for being offhand to\nstudents when they used the office.\nDon Ferguson did not approach his\njob as dill i gently, and there has been a lack of harmony between Student\nServices staff for some months. It is a sensible move to pass the res on sibi lit y for invoicing and collecting rents to\nthe Finance Section, but as yet the\nwelfare service is without a permanent home. I would suggest\nthat the welfare section be transferred\nto the Health Centre, and perhaps\namalgamated with the Student\nCounsellor's office. I wish Lesley\nGillingham the best of luck with her\nnew job, but she may struggle to keep\nup her work on welfare; the situation\nneeds to be resolved swiftly. College\nadministration did not take the\nopportunity to re-structure Student\nServices when Don Ferguson took\nover; this time there must be a little\nmore foresight.\nHold The Front\nPage\nAs I promised to try and expand the\ncontent of FELIX in the last issue\nbefore Christmas, it is a little\ndisappointing to start the spring\nterm with such a light issue. There\nare still a few production difficulties\nbut, with luck, they should be\nresolved within the next two weeks\nonce the new typesetter is fully\ninstalled.\nThere will be meeting in the\nFELIX office today at 12.30pm for\nanyone who would like to join the\nFELIX staff this term; I appreciate\nthat many students will already be\ninvolved with other clubs and\nsocieties, but there is no need to\nmake a heavy commit t ment. I will be\nmaking particular efforts to ensure\nthat the production runs to schedule\nthis term, and so we should be\ncollating at a civilised hour. If\nanyone is not doing anything next\nThursday at 9.00pm, you know\nwhere to go.\nCredits\nMore deeds of heroism from several\npeople this week because the Print\nUnit was without a typesetter\noperator.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nSudden Reshuffle At\nStudent Services\nFormer Welfare Adviser Lesley Gillingham has been promoted to\nthe position of Student Accommodation Officer, replacing Don\nFerguson, who was previously Student Services Officer, and has\ntaken up a position in the College's Finance Section. The changes\nwere made in a sudden reshuffle in the last few days of the\nChristmas term. The Student Services Office has ceased to exist, as\nhas the position of Student Services Officer. Ms Gillingham's new\npost gives her responsibility for the allocation of College\naccommodation. Invoicing for residences will be passed to the\nCollege Finance Section. College administration is intending to\nappoint a new Welfare Adviser shortly, though this will not be dealt\nwith as part of the Student Accomodation Office.\nThe long term plans for Student introduction of computers had been\nAccommodation Office are\nuncertain. College Assistant\nSecretary Michael Arthur, formally\nStudent Services Officer himself,\nwill have a \"watching brief over\nstudent accommodation in the early\nstages. Mr Arthur told FELIX that\nthe restructured service may be\nabsorbed as part of the Conference\nOffice, which has control of student\nresidences during the vacations at\nthe moment. The welfare service is\nalso to be reorganised.\nThere has been pressure from IC\nUnion for some time for the welfare\nservice to become seperate from\nStudent Services. The reorganisation was introduced when\nMr Ferguson expressed an interest\nin a position in the Finance Section.\nHe is now working in personnel and\nadministrative services. Mr Arthur\ndenied that the reorganisation had\nbeen precipitated by Ms Gillingham\napplying for posts elsewhere.\nMs Gillingham will continue to\nact as Welfare Advisor until a new\nappointment is made. The bulk of\nthe work as Student Accommodation Officer will not be directly\nwelfare-related, however. Financial\nAssistant Dave Parry, a former\nDeputy President of IC Union, will\nbe transfering from Student Services\nto the Finance Section as part of the\nreorganisation.\nDon Ferguson was interviewed\nby FELIX on Wednesday.\nReviewing the progress that the\nStudent Services Office had made\nunder his leadership, he said that the\nthe major step forward. The Student\nServices Office, he said, had become\none of the major users of the\nCollege's data base and processing\nfacilities. There had also been\ncertain problems with the\ncomputing facilities, though,\nparticularly on the communications\nside.\nMr Ferguson said that the\nCollege's accommodation was \"no\nbetter, no worse\" than it was 18\nmonths ago. IC is about to lose a fairly high proportion of the Head\nTenancies in Hamlet Gardens,\nthough College will be trying to\nreplace this elsewhere. The stage\nhad been reached, he explained,\nwhere rents near to College were so\nfar above what students can be\ncharged that \"no reasonable\namount of subsidy would make\nthem viable\". Efforts are now being\nmade to locate accommodation\nfurther away from IC, where rents\nwould, hopefully, be sufficiently\ncheap to offset the additional\ntransport costs.\nMr Ferguson said that he thought\nthe Student Services staff had got on\npretty well in the last six months,\nand had worked together well as a team. He added, though, that the\nstaff were under great pressure,\nparticularly at \"peak times\". He\nthought that the average student's opinion of Student Services has\nbeen fairly high.\nWhen questioned about whether\nthe College would in future have\ndifficulty providing rooms for all\nLesley Gillingham\nDon Ferguson\nstudents who were guaranteed\nplaces, particularly in light of the\nproblems at the beginning of the\nacademic year, Mr Ferguson said\nthat the situation would be difficult\nbut not impossible. Urgent\nconsideration was now been given\nto finding new accommodation. He\nconcluded that Ms Gillingham will\ndo \"as well as she is allowed to\" in\nher new post.\nFree Friday January 9th1987 No. 758\n\n"

As with the\nprevious thefts from Linstead Hall,\nit was mainly photo g rahi c and and\nmusic equipment that was taken.\nThere were no signs of forcible entry\nand the rooms had been locked at\nthe time. The items were stolen\nbet wen4 pm and 9pm when many\nstudents were moving out of Hall\nfor the Christmas vacation. The\nburglars took two empty suitcases, a camera, a walkman and hi-fi\nequipment valued at \u00a31,100.\nIt is thought that the same master\nkey was used to gain entry as in\nprevious burglaries from Linstead\nHall. This master key went missing\nover a year ago during the Summer\nperiod. College Security is in the\nprocess of ordering new locks for\nthe Hall.\nsec\nVideo\nA new television and video machine\nhave been purchased by the Social\nClubs Committee and were\ndelivered to the Union Office earlier\nthis week.

The\ninauguration will take place at the\nAnnual Fellows Dinner in May.\nMr. Smith was a student at the\ncollege, graduating in 1949.\nIncreased Funding\nIn Polytechnics\nEducation Secretary Kenneth Baker\nannounced the allocations to\npolytechnics and local authority\ncolleges for 1987-88 in the House of\nCommons on 19 December 1986.\nThe amount has been increased by\nnearly 8.5% over 1986-87, to\n\u00a3716.5m. This means that there will\nbe 3000 more places at polytechnics\nand colleges for the coming\nacademic year. The National\nAdvisory Body for Public Sector\nHigher Education( NAB) recommended the closure of town\nand country planning undergraduate colleges from 1987-88.\nHowever, Mr. Baker has\nprovisionally decided that the\ncourses at Leeds and Coventry\nPolytechnics, and Essex Institute of\nHigher Education, should close\nfrom 1988-89. He has also increased\nthe number of places for fine arts at\ncertain institutes, to moderate the\noverall reduction of fine arts\nnumbers recommended by the\nNAB.\nThe capital allocations to the\nlocal authorities in England for\n1987-88 are to be \u00a3297 million.\nOverall, there is an estimated \u00a32.8\nbillion in receipts available to\nauthorities in 1987-88. At the same\ntime, the Government has made\n\u00a3200 million available for a new\nscheme for the in-service training of\nteachers and others employed in the\neducation sector.\n'New'\nWarden\nA new warden has been appointed\nfor Falmouth/Keogh Hall in\nSouthside. Professor New, head of\nthe Laser Optics Group in the\nPhysics department, was given the\njob towards the end of last term, and\nis expected to move in during the\nnext few weeks.\nHe told FELIX that he saw his\nrole as a senior member of the\nCollege within the Hall; to act as\nsomebody residents could talk to if\nthey had problems, to become\ninvolved in the social life, and to\ngenerally improve the quality of life\nfor the residents, something, he\nadded, that was needed in any Hall.\n\n"
