Photo Credit: Brian Jeffrey Beggerly\nW\nith Euro 2016 in\nfull swing there is\nno better time to\nexplore the science\nof football. Why are some players\nsuch as Cristiano Ronaldo naturally\ngifted whereas others need to\nwork hard in nurturing their skill?\nDr. Manning, at the University\nof Liverpool, published research\nthat suggests football skills may be\ngenetic. The ring to index finger\nratio might hold the genetic key.\nPlyometrictrainingtargetingmuscle\nand the nerve fibres controlling it is\nrequired to enhance skill, because\nit enables footballers to switch\nbetween concentric contractions\nthat shorten muscles and eccentric\ncontractions that lengthen and hold\nthem under tension. Science is also\ninvolved when it comes to scoring\ngoals. Bernoulli\u2019s principle and the\nMagnus enable a ball with the right\namount of power and spin to pass\nthe wall of defenders as it slows into\nlaminar flow before reaching the\ngoal keeper.\nA\nt Sh!t Sc!ence, we\u2019ve\nbeen trying to provide\nevidence that the\nscientific method that is\nin place is an effective filter, and that\nas such, there is no such thing as\n\u2018shit science\u2019. But as it is the end of\nthe year, and you might be going off\nto glorious academic careers, here\nare a few things you should know\nto be able to judge a scientific paper\ncritically.\nScientists need to publish to\nsurvive. A scientist\u2019s worth is\nevaluated depending on the number,\nor the \u2018quality\u2019 of articles that he or\nshe publishes, and that influences\nwho the funding bodies are going to\nchose to fund.\nWhile scientists, on average, work\non a paper for publish for four\nyears, their work is condensed in\nabout 5000 words. That means that\nscientists will have a tendency to\nonly present the most convincing\narguments to support their story,\nand can be inclined not to publish\nA fitting tribute to the wackiest of fictional scientists. Photo Credit: Heather\nPaul\nMARIANNE GUENOT\nSh!t Sc!ence\nSentimental columnists concludes all science is worthwhile science\nthe experiments that haven\u2019t worked.\nPeer-review is a fantastic and\nnecessary process.However,because\nyou have to ask people that are\nin the field to comment on the\nscience, and because a specific field\nin science can be very narrow, you\noften ask people\u2019s competitors to\njudge the work, and it has been\nshown that reviewers sabotage\ntheir competitors\u2019 work to make\ntheir research publish before their\ncompetitors\u2019.\nJournals are attributed an \u2018impact\nfactor\u2019 which is determined\naccording to how many people\nread the content of the journal. The\nhigher the impact factor, the more\nprestigious the journal is thought\nto be, and the more scientists will\nwant to submit their articles to that\njournal. However, to maintain that\ntraffic to their journal, editors might\nbe tempted to reject a perfectly\ngood article on the basis that it is\nnot \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 or trendy enough.\nIt is a system put in place by\nhumans and limited by human\nenvy. However, it is the best\nsystem that we have, and all\nin all, it ensures a high level of\nintegrity within the scientific\ncommunity.\nI know that during this past\nyear, together we embarked on\na journey that looked at the\nlighter side of science, packed\nwith sarcasm and a questionable\nsense of humour.\nBut I honestly hope as this\nfinal term draws to the end, that\nyou have been convinced that all\nscience is helpful, even though\nit is a human-driven process,\nand as such has its pitfalls.\nSo whether you\u2019re reading\nabout the wobble of obese\npenguins, the painfully difficult\nMario Bros stages, or the ability\nof fish to hate, don\u2019t raise your\neyebrows, don\u2019t shake your\nhead.

    "content": "as mere algorithms \u2013 kind interactions in, an\nincrease in the number of friends out \u2013 which\nin turn lead to further career progression.\nBut not all of us play the game in such a\nstraight-forward RPG style. Some stay true\nto the architectural origins of The Sims, and\nattempt to build luxurious dwellings, filled with\nexpensive, yet tasteful, furniture. Whether\nor not the player chooses this method, or\nfocuses on career progression, the end result\nis largely the same: a manor house filled with\nthe trappings of wealth, and all that a sim\ncould desire. But what then? What happens to\nthe game once this endgame of the American\ndream has been reached?\nFor me, it is at this point that the game begins\nto lose interest. Where a sim family is rich\nenough that no object in the Buy catalogue\nis out of their reach, we begin to enter a\nsense of listless purposelessness \u2013 once we\nhave attained all the possessions (a limit\nquantified by need, not by supply \u2013 in the sim-world, resources are infinite), the goal of our\nsims\u2019 lives is removed. The Sims centres itself\naround work, and as such seems to clearly\nreflect entrenched capitalism, where we can\nonly find meaning through cycles of labour\nand consumption. Once our virtual avatars\nhave attained enough wealth, we are faced\nwith an existential crisis out of which there are\ntwo escapes: starting over, or death.\n\u00a7\nT\nhe original base-game of The Sims\nprovides us with only four possible\ndeaths: electrocution, starvation,\nfire, and drowning. Later iterations\nand expansion packs added in a myriad\nof other creative ways for us to torture and\ndispose of our sims, but there is an attractive\nsimplicity to these original four methods\nof death: they remind me of the points of a\ncompass, or perhaps the four humours \u2013 fixed\nand exact (and exacting). Sims are not only\nunable to die from old age, but seem immune\nfrom the aging process altogether: child sims\ndo not turn into adults, and \u2013 just as adults\nare stuck in a cycle of work \u2013 children must\ngo to school every day (it is worth pointing\nout that the penalties of breaking out of this\ncycle are more severe for children \u2013 they will\nbe sent off to military school, never to be seen\nagain).\nThe striking result of this is to transform all\ninstances of death in The Sims into a personal\nfailing on the part of the player. While in the\nreal world death can be seen as a chance\nof misfortune \u2013 blameless, although certainly\nnot victimless; by eliminating deaths from\nillness, or crime, or old age, The Sims confers\nan enormous responsibility. As it says in the\nmanual, \u201cif they die, it is your responsibility\nalone\u201d. If your sim starves, it is because you\nhaven\u2019t provided them with enough food;\nif they burn, it is because you lacked the\nforesight to install fire alarms. As such, despite\nthe fact that you can turn on \u2018autonomy\u2019 in\nthe settings, The Sims embraces a form of\ndeterminism in which the ultimate decisions \u2013\nthose of life and death \u2013 are controlled by\nthe player, who is raised to the status of a\nminiature God.\nThere is a deep undercurrent of unease that\nruns through The Sims, one that is reinforced\nby the glee with which some players torture\ntheir sims. In my instruction manual for The\nSims, the language used tends to encourage\nplayers to experiment in making their sims\u2019\nlives as miserable as possible: it speaks of\n\u201cmismanagement\u201d of their affairs, of how you\ncan \u201cruin their lives\u201d. The internet is littered\nwith innumerable videos of players torturing\ntheir sims in a number of ways, typically by\nplacing them in a small room with no exit,\nand watching as they slowly starve. The Sims\nhighlights the delight which which we inflict\ncruelty, albeit virtual, giving credence to the\nNietzschian idea of an instinct for cruelty.\nSo does The Sims \u2013 with its emphasis on\nendless consumption, its bland presentation\nof modern suburbia, its endless cycle of work\nand rest \u2013 represent a parody of modern\ncapitalist culture? Wright certainly intended\nfor it to be read as a satire of society: \u201cIf you\nsit there and build a big mansion that\u2019s all full\nof stuff\u2026you realise that all these objects end\nup sucking up all your time\u2026and it\u2019s actually\nkind of a parody of consumerism, in which\nat some point your stuff takes over your life\u201d\nHowever, others disagree: Frasca writes that\nwhile The Sims may poke fun at consumerism,\n\u2018since it rewards the player every time she\nbuys new stuff, I do not think this could be\nconsidered parody\u2019. For Frasca, the more\nimportant ideological claim made by The Sims\nis merely that life can be simulated.\nWhile the nature of videogames, whose\ndesigners legislate algorithmic laws, make\nthem ripe for interpretation, I believe that The\nSims functions as neither a parody nor a tacit\nendorsement of consumer society. As Frasca\nwrites, \u201cthe author does not set the meaning\nof a simulation, but it is rather interpreted\nby the player\u201d \u2013 regardless of what Will\nWright intended, once The Sims has been\ndownloaded onto our computers, it takes on\na life of its own. In some sense, when we play\nThe Sims, there occurs a cybernetic version of\nRoland Barthes\u2019 \u2018death of the author\u2019, where\nthe programmer\u2019s intentions do not carry over\nto her creation \u2013 this is a feature exacerbated\nby allowing the player to take screenshots\nand establish a \u2018family album\u2019, encouraging\nthe player to form their own narrative.\nWhat The Sims is doing, therefore, moves\npast parody. It is fruitful to bear in mind\nthe distinction expressed by post-modern\ntheorist Frederik Jameson between parody\nand pastiche: while both involve a sense\nof mimicry, pastiche is a neutral mimicry,\n\u201cwithout parody\u2019s ulterior motive, without\nthe satirical impulse, without laughter\u201d. In\nthis sense The Sims is nothing more than a\nmere \u2018blank parody\u2019. In its recreation of\nhuman life, The Sims does not express an\nopinion; it is emotionally blank. All it does\nis reflect our existence, allowing us to be the\njudges. Whether we read it as a parody or\nan endorsement of consumerism says more\nabout ourselves than the game.\n\u00a7\nM\ny own reading of The Sims is that it\nworks as a videogame version of a\nsecurity blanket, shielding us from\nsocial, economic, and political\nworries. The Sims replicates real life, but with\nall the rough edges smoothed off, rendering\nit hospitable and welcoming. Consider things\nlike racism: in a nod to diversity, the game\nallows you to alter the skin tone of your\navatars, but these are nothing more than lines\nof code, and make absolutely no effect to\nwhat happens in game; even the skin colour of\nyour sims\u2019 offspring is decided on randomly,\neliminating any ideas of race. Similarly,\nsame-sex relationships are possible within the\ngame, but they do not provoke any reaction\nfrom your sims\u2019 friends and neighbours; and\nanything women sims can do, male ones\ncan do too, bar getting pregnant. The Sims,\ntherefore, provides us with the idealised\nutopia of a world that is post-gender, post-sexuality, and post-race; logging on allows us\nto forget that bigotry exists in the real world,\neven if only for a couple of hours.\nAs well as looking forward to this utopia,\nThe Sims allows players to look back. While\nthe buy catalogue is large enough to cover\na number of different eras, the relentless\noptimism and endless consumption reminds\nme of the 1950s and 60s \u2013 that period of\nAmerican dominance, regularly referred to as\na \u2018simpler time\u2019, when, with the benefit of rose-tinted glasses, all was right with the world. The\ngame also takes us back to the specific time\nof its release, which occurred seven months\nbefore the events of 9/11, and the ushering in\nof a terror-obsessed panoptic world. As terms\nlike \u2018war on terror\u2019 and \u2018Patriot Act\u2019 become\nmore and more commonplace, people in\nWestern society began to experience a sense\nof unease, and the emancipatory vision of\nthe computer as a means of social liberation\ndisintegrated, to be replaced with NSA\nmonitoring, \u2018Big Brother\u2019 society, and mass\ndata surveillance. To play The Sims allows\nus to forget that politics exists \u2013 the closest\nThe Sims comes to a political statement is in\nforcing all players to buy their homes, making\nsociety based around property, but nothing\nelse forces the player to look at political\nquandaries.\nWhen we play The Sims, therefore, we are\nsoothed by this lack of economic and political\nturbulence. The Sims, while it is supposedly\nmodelled on the world, removes anything\nfrom the world that could be provoking or\nchallenging: the family we create does not\nneed to worry about whether or not they\nwill be able to get a job, they do not need\nto worry about Brexit, or the Middle East, or\nthe presidential election. The Sims provides\na pancea for our modern sense of alienation\nand confusion, taking us to a world before it\nwas made difficult.\nI believe that The Sims will continue to carry\nthis kind of nostalgia with it, but in the coming\nyears it will also begin to accrue another\nkind of appeal. In their book, Inventing the\nFuture, left-wing writers Nick Srnicek and\nAlex Williams make the case that increasingly\nsophisticated technology, coupled with an\nincrease in automation, could usher in a\npost-capitalist age. As the neoliberal project\nbegins to falter, evidenced by the financial\ncrisis and the lurch towards austerity, Srnicek\nand Williams put forward a new vision of the\nfuture, one in which working hours will be cut\nand a universal basic income implemented.\nWhether or not this will actually occur, their\nprediction that our burgeoning technological\npower will undercut the need for raw labour\nseems to be sound, and in the future it is\nlikely that \u2013 unless things rapidly change \u2013\nwe may be facing a world without work. In\nsuch a world, The Sims may provide us with a\ndifferent kind of attraction: with its emphasis\non the centrality of labour, the ease with\nwhich your sims can find and keep jobs, The\nSims can serve as a throwback to a time when\nwork was a reality. In The Sims there will be\nno technological revolution. There will be no\npost-capitalism. And so when we plug in, The\nSims can provide us with a nostalgic look back\nto before the world was automated.\nAs we have seen, The Sims leaves itself open\nto a multitude of interpretations: the neutral\nisometric world of pixilated suburbia allows us\nto read it in any number of ways. The Sims may\nbe an anti-consumerist parody of American\nlife, a soma-esque escape from the problems\nof the real world, or a nostalgic amusement\nin a post-capitalist future. In attempting to\nreplicate life, The Sims\u2019 innate blankness\nholds a mirror up to our society. Astonishingly\nadvanced for its time, and ground-breaking in\nthe videogame world, The Sims provides us\nwith much more than an opportunity to play\nGod: it offers us the chance to take a deep\nlook into our own human nature, and come\nout the other side enriched.\nFigure 5: Alongside electrocution, immolation, and starvation, the final method of death in The Sims is\ndrowning, which players typically achieve by placing their sim in a swimming pool and removing the ladder.\nUnable to exit the pool, your sim will instead flounder around until they tire, before sinking to the bottom of\nthe pool. Many players have strong memories of doing such an act as soon as they had a copy of the game.\nFigure 6: In The Sims, it is possible to pause, fastforward, and \u201csuperspeed\u201d the game. This reduces the\nmundanity of watching your sim sleep, or waiting for your sim to get back from work, but doesn\u2019t change the\nfact that you\u2019re actually just spending your free time living the lives of others. While The Sims may allows the\nplayer to act as a God by speeding up time, it doesn\u2019t allow us to rewind it \u2013 when we make a mistake, the\nmistake is forever (unless you\u2019ve got a save backed-up).\n17\n16\n\n"

You\u2019re\ngiven two different paint brush\nsizes and a bucket which can be\nused, with varying force, to throw\npaint onto the canvas. Together,\nthese constraints force you to be\ncreative.

Cuckoo Curling combines\nthese two games into a wacky\nturn-based strategic sport.

However, unlike\nConnect Four, the added element\nof curling allows you to push your\nopponent\u2019s discs out of the play\narea. Twisting the formula even\nfurther are the two animals that\nwill snatch up your disc whenever\nit falls outside the grid. This is all\nrendered in stylised orange and\ngrey cel-shaded graphics. From\nthe charming animations to its\ncatchy music, Cuckoo Curling is\neasily worthy of a few minutes of\nyour time.\nCarrots and Cream,\nAergia\nThe faint crunching of food has\nnever been more terrifying.\nCarrots and Cream simulates\ngardening and food preparation,\nand emulates horror movies all\nin under five minutes. The screen\nsoftly vibrates with a filter of\ntelevision static, as the player\nends the short lives of a number\nof innocent carrots. After this\nculinary massacre, the tables are\nturned and as a worm you must\nescape the deathly slice of a\ngarden shovel, only to be grated\nto death. Truly horrific stuff.\nSolitude,\nAlexandre Ignatov\nFor many, our bedrooms are\nplaces of isolation, separated\nfrom the rest of the world.\nIncreasingly, it is a space we\nnever need to leave, with internet\nservices providing anything at any\ntime directly to our door.

The\nplayer, an unknown and faceless\ncharacter, has become a \u2018hermit\u2019.\nBy giving us only a single room\nto explore, Igantov shows us how\nthis single space has come to\ndefine a person.

    "content": "How did you get the game out there then?\nDid you send it to games publications or\nwas it just through word-of-mouth on the\ninternet?\nWe were reviewed in PC Gamer. We sent copies of\nit to every magazine out there \u2013 not just the gaming\nmagazines but also lifestyle magazines. I remember I\u2019d\ngone skiing with Tom and we got back and the Linux\nFormat review was the first review to hit. I thought the\nLinux guys were going to love Uplink and the Linux\nFormat reviewer gave it 61%. I remember picking it\nup in the newsagent at the airport and I was crushed.\nWe thought that this was the end of this adventure for\nus. We didn\u2019t think we would be able to pursue a 61%\ngame. About two weeks later, the PC Gamer review\ncame out. Now obviously PC Gamer is bigger than\nLinux Format. The reviewer, Kieron Gillen, only gave\nus have a page but it turned things around for us. After\nthat every score was 80% plus.\nThen we asked ourselves, what\u2019s the next step? At this\npoint we were selling it boxed online and the obvious\nnext step was getting it into the shops. In those days,\nand still now, my thinking is to go back to first principles.\nIf I\u2019m going to put a game into the shop, what are\nthey going to do to add value. They were just putting\ngames on shelves in front of a consumer. We went to a\ndistributor rather than a publisher and did a deal with\nthem. They charged about a quid a box, which sounded\nreasonable to me. The indie game stores took it. Zavvi\nrefused it. Game refused it. HMV were the only major\nstore that carried Uplink. WHSmith\u2019s wouldn\u2019t carry\nit, they said it was immoral. We made a bit of money\nfrom this but not a lot. We\u2019d done our UK retail deal so\nthen we looked to North America. Rather than working\nwith a distributor over there we knew we had to work\nwith a publisher, because we couldn\u2019t do the marketing\nourselves. We went to a couple of trade shows and\neventually hooked up with a company called Strategy\nFirst, a Canadian company. They were going to\nadvance us $50,000 dollars for distribution across the\nUnited States with a ten percent royalty. We were only\nthree guys so we were quite happy with this. Strategy\nFirst renamed it Uplink Hacker Elite \u2013 which Chris hates\n\u2013 and redid the packaging. So, they distributed it and\nwe waited for our $50k cheque to come back and then\nthey declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in\nCanada, which means they didn\u2019t have to pay any of\ntheir debts. So we didn\u2019t see a penny of the sales over\nthere. I don\u2019t think it did very well either.\nSo at this point you weren\u2019t digitally\ndistributing the game on your website?\nNo. We actually padded the build size out with an\nencrypted MP3 of Chris playing his guitar to something\nthat would take three hours to download over a 56k\nmodem. We determined that three hours we be too\nlong for pirates to share the game. There was no real\nonline distribution at this point but that was our novel\ncounter-piracy strategy. It didn\u2019t work. Nothing works.\nAfter Uplink, the next game you released\nwas Darwinia. Could you tell me more\nabout how that came about?\nChris had finished writing Uplink the day Tom and I got\ninvolved in the business. We were desperately looking\nat how we could make more money from it: a Linux\nversion, a Mac version, and all those distribution deals I\ntalked about. We even looked at Pocket PCs and PDAs.\nBut Chris had been on Uplink for two years and he was\nfinished with it so he went on to write Darwinia. There\nwas quite a lot of tension in the company at that point\nbecause we wanted him working on Uplink. Darwinia\ntook him a long time to get finished. Uplink had been\ndeveloped at university in his spare time so we expected\nthe next game, a full-time project, to be delivered in\nabout a year. Ultimately, for various reasons Darwinia\ntook three years to make so we were well and truly\nout of money after that period. We were broke, flat\nbroke. Tom and Chris were selling all their CDs and\nsigning on to benefits to try and keep things going.\nThen we launched Darwinia. And Darwinia was a\ntough old sell. Now we had a lot more experience and\nour route to market was more open. The game reviewed\nvery strongly; it got 90% in PC Gamer. They loved\nit. It went into the IGF Awards [Independent Games\nFestival] and won three prizes that year because it was\nlike no other indie game. Independent games in those\ndays were much smaller. Darwinia was what Chris likes\nto call triple-I. This was pre World of Goo.\nPeople in the games industry were really excited and\nwanted to see what would become of the indie game\nscene. They were willing to look past Darwinia\u2019s QA\nproblems and its control problems to see the game for\nwhat it really was. But commercially it was a flop, we\nstruggled to make any money back.\nNow, at that time Valve were just about to launch\ntheir digital distribution platform called Steam and they\nreached out to us (or we reached out to them) and we\nhad a big debate internally about whether we should\nput Darwinia on Steam. We were looking at the sales\nfor our site, which were pretty small, and decided that\neven if they did cannibalise our sales we were making\nso little money it didn\u2019t matter. The status quo was that\nwe were fucked. So, we did the deal with Steam. Which\nwas of course the best deal we\u2019ve done in the history\nof Introversion. Everything we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ve made\nthrough Valve. Darwinia didn\u2019t immediately pick up but\nobviously Valve brought the audience and the sales did\neventually increase enough for us to get Defcon done.\nDefcon was a really big moment for us. It was\nmassively popular, more popular than anything else\nwe\u2019d ever seen. In those days you had to hire a physical\nbox, and our servers just died under the load. It took us\nfive or six hours to get them back up. I don\u2019t know how\nmuch money we lost in that time. Still, it was by far the\nbiggest commercial success we\u2019d had up to that point.\nBut the perception was that Darwinia was the bigger\nsuccess. This is where things started to go wrong for\nus. Microsoft, or an agent, reached out to us and said\nthat Darwinia had won all these awards and Microsoft\nwere launching the Xbox 360 and would be doing\ndigital downloads. Microsoft were very interested in\nDarwinia and new IP. They wanted really cool indie\ntitles.\nEven though Darwinia hadn\u2019t been particularly\npopular we then got involved into what turned out to\nbe a six or seven year mammoth project. They wanted\nevery game on XBLA to be multiplayer \u2013 that was\npart of their strategy. Darwinia had originally been a\nmultiplayer game but ended up being singleplayer. We\nthought it would be as simple as just reactivating the\nmultiplayer mode of the game. We tried to do that and\nit just didn\u2019t work. It was shit.\nThat ended up with Chris working on our fourth\ngame, Multiwinia. The company got sidetracked down\nthis multiplayer route that we had agreed to deliver\nfor Microsoft. And we had done so much work for this\nmultiplayer game. Even though it didn\u2019t review well\nand no one bought it, Multiwinia was still a brilliantly\nfun game. We launched it on PC and nobody played\nit. Everybody who had enjoyed Darwinia looked at\nMultiwinia, which was a completely different gameplay\nexperience, and said \u2018I don\u2019t want to play this\u2019. And\nthe rest of the world who had played Darwinia and\nhated it didn\u2019t want to play the sequel. We ended up\ntargeting a niche of a niche.\nAt conferences people still come up to us and tell\nus that Uplink is the best game they\u2019ve ever played,\nthat Darwinia is the best game they\u2019ve ever played,\nor that Defcon is the best game they\u2019ve ever played.\nAnd there have been more than ten people in the last\nten years that have said Multiwinia was the best game\nthey\u2019d ever played. So we must have done something\nright with it.\nIt was a big flop on PC but we were still working on\nthe console version of it. This was going to be a bigger,\nshinier version of the game. Eventually we burned the\ncompany into the ground \u2013 there was no money left.\nWe were going to launch Darwinia and Multiwinia\ntogether on XBLA as Darwinia+ about six years after\nwe had intended to do that. And it flopped too. The day\nafter we launched we knew things hadn\u2019t gone well. I\nphoned everyone up and sacked them. I shut down\nthe office. We had quite a lot of debt that we\u2019d taken\non, so I had to restructure all of that. I didn\u2019t think that\nwas going to be easy. I wasn\u2019t really a businessperson\nat that time, I was just a person. And when you owe\nsomeone money as a person you go to court and they\ncome round to your house and take your stuff. What I\ndidn\u2019t realise was that companies aren\u2019t quite like that.\nWith everyone I owed money to, we made a payment\nplan over about a two year period. If anyone one of\nthem had rejected the payment plan they would all lose\nall of it. Obviously, they all accepted it. After a little\nwhile we suddenly realised that there was a reasonable\namount of money still dripping into Introversion from\nthe back catalogue on Steam. And to be fair, a little bit\ncoming in from Microsoft. All of these little trickles were\nmerging into a stream of money. That was enough to\nkeep me and Chris employed. That\u2019s when Chris came\nup with Prison Architect. At that point Humble Bundle\nhad just launched. They\u2019d already done a Frozenbyte\nbundle and we went out and asked if there was any\ninterest in an Introversion one. We would bundle our\ngames and give them other stuff like tech demos and\nthey liked this idea. Kieron Gillen was the first time the\ncompany was saved and Humble Bundle, in my view,\nwas the second time. We made about three quarters\nof a million from the \u2018Humble Introversion Bundle\u2019\nand that just gave us enough cash to get to the alpha\nversion of Prison Architect. That takes us up to 2012.\nWithin three days of Prison Architect launching we\u2019d\nmade $100,000 dollars. Now we\u2019ve made about $22\nmillion. Humble gave us just that little bit of resource to\nget us to Prison Architect, which was our first mega-hit.\nI remember buying that bundle at the\ntime, and that was the first time I had\never heard of the company. Do you think\nthat the bundle\u2019s success helped with\ngetting your name out there and played\na part in Prison Architect\u2019s success?\nOne of the things that I learnt relatively early on was\nthat everyone else\u2019s view of Introversion was not the\nsame as mine. I kind of assumed everyone knew all\nof our games and knew we were the company behind\nUplink. I\u2019d lived it. There was this natural assumption\nthat someone who had bought Uplink would buy\nDarwinia. The reality is that it\u2019s nothing like that at all.\nYou stand on each game separately. I\u2019m quite big on\ntrying to push the Introversion brand. I want people\nto say that they\u2019re buying the next Introversion game\nbecause they know it\u2019s going to be good even if it\ndoesn\u2019t review very well, like Tarantino. People go and\nwatch his movies because there hasn\u2019t really been a\nbad one. There\u2019s been great ones and mediocre ones\nbut they have never been awful. So I think the Humble\nBundle brought a new audience to us and Prison\nArchitect built a new audience on top of that.\n>>>\nFrom Uplink to Darwinia\nUplink.\nKieron\nGillen was\nthe first\ntime the\ncompany\nwas saved\nand Humble\nBundle, in\nmy view,\nwas the\nsecond time\n7\n6\n\n"

We\u2019ve jammed and\ntransformed our brains,\nlearning some things\nbetter than others. We\u2019ve prepared\nourselves with the tools we need for\nthe next chapter in our lives. As we\nall go our own ways this summer\n(unless you\u2019re stuck here on campus\ntoiling away while everyone jovially\ntwirls outside in their freedom, like\nme) what are the really important\nthings to remember from all we\u2019ve\nexperienced this year?\nHopefully we\u2019ve learned that the\nindividual components of science\ncan be fallible, and so they should\nbe. Something that cannot be tested\nor tried with the likelihood of failure\nis something that cannot improve,\nlearn,and reach the next rung on the\nladder of progress. As practitioners\nof science, we constantly revise old\nmethods, ideas, and materials, while\ncreating and uncovering new ones.\nScience accepts that old ways of\nthinking must change in the light of\nnew knowledge\nAnd this fallibility and willingness\nto change and grow, is perhaps one\nof the most subtle yet powerful\nlessons science has for us as human\nbeings. We constantly face a world\nthat tests the mettle of our character\nand makes us question our old ways\nof thinking and being, in the ways\nwe treat the world and each other.\nAt the risk of sounding like I\u2019m\nproselytizing, I propose we should\nuse this scientific technique of self-correction to improve ourselves; to\nbecome kinder and better people.\nIn the light of the types of events\nthat have shaken the consciousness\nof the Western world recently\n(and one can barely imagine the\nevents the rest of the world endures\nwithout the light of our media\nlens) which threaten to destabilise\nan understanding of the collective\nunity of humanity, science can help\nguide the way. Self-correcting our\nprejudice, hatred, and selfishness\nby reviewing the \u2018literature\u2019 and\nseeing that it never, ever does the\nworld good. Changing our practices\nto those loving, accepting actions\nthat have proved to increase our\nindividual and collective happiness\ntime and time again. Call it\nhumanity or call it science \u2013 there\u2019s\nno better choice for us but to grow\nand learn from our mistakes.\nNAOMI STEWART\nDuring periods of economic austerity easily treatable illnesses thrive.

Dr. Kenneth\nGordon, dermatology professor at\nNorthwestern University Feinberg\nSchool of Medicine, first author\nof the paper publishing the results\nof the phase three trials, explained\nthat these positive responses\npersisted for at least 60 weeks.\nPsoriasis is an immune-mediated\ninflammatory response which is\nalso associated with increased risk\nof depression, heart disease and\ndiabetes. The drug functions by\nneutralising the immune system\npathway which is known for\npromoting psoriasis. Participants\nof the trials suffered from psoriasis\nranging from moderate to severe.\nDrug effectiveness was measured\nvia comparisons with a placebo.\nClearing the symptoms is finally\na reality. The drug has been\napproved by the Food and Drug\nAdministrations, however the safety\nof the drug for longer than 60 weeks\nstill needs to be studied.\nAmato et al. 2016 @ New England\nJournal of Medicine\nJane Courtnell\nScience Editor\nEmo or ecstatic? How do you\nfeel when sad music loops on your\nSpotify playlist? Researchers at\nDurham University have found\nthat sad music affects different\npeople in different ways. 2436\nindividuals from the UK and\nFinland participated in the survey\nthat investigated the impact of\nmusic for mood control. While\nsome people felt an essence of joy\nwhen sad music was played, others\nfound music physically straining\nand deflating as it spurred the\ndreaded remembrance of loved ones\nand other painful experiences. The\ndisparity in reactions is thought to\nmainly be due to music associations\nwith certain environmental\nexperiences, thus the research has\nimplications for music therapist\nto carefully consider the music\nrepresentations for their choice\nof music. So if next time you play\n\u2018Barbie Girl\u2019 your flatmate starts to\nugly cry as he\u2019s singing along to the\nchorus, don\u2019t be too surprised.\nEerola & Pertola 2016 @ Plos One\nEarth-like sea\non Europa\nIs this song sad\nor is it happy?\nDespite the hundreds of cat\nfail videos on the interwebs\nsuggesting otherwise, new research\nfrom Kyoto University in Japan\nconfirms that cats indeed possess\nan understanding of physics. The\nresearch suggests that cats can not\nonly understand the principle of\ncause and effect, but also some\nelements of physics. The science is\nnot exactly groundbreaking though.\nExperiments consisted of putting\nobjects in containers and testing\nwhether cats could predict whether\nthe containers were empty or not\nbased on the sounds they made.\nThe researchers also noted that cats\nseemed to stare longer at containers\nthat sounded empty but ended up\nhiding an object inside and the other\nway round. Prolonged staring is the\ncat equivalent of bewilderment FYI.\nSo if you\u2019ve watched those videos\nof cats playing Cups and Balls and\nwondered how the cats seemed to\nget it right every time, the answer\nis physics. Oh, and a good sense of\nhearing.\nTakagi et al. 2016 @ Animal\nCognition\nScientists at the Science\nFoundation\u2019s Green Bank Telescope\nogled through their highly sensitive\nradio telescope to observe the\nfirst complex chiral molecule. The\nmolecule, hiding under the thick\ncover of a cloud of stardust is named\nPropylene Oxide (CH3\nCHOCH2\n).\nIf you are not familiar with the\npopular chemistry term \u2018chiral\nmolecule\u2019, it refers to molecules\nwhich have left\u00ad\nh-anded and right\u00ad\nhanded conformations while being\nidentical in every other respect. Just\nlike our hands, a mirror image of\neach other. Why is this discovery\nso...handy? Chiral molecules are\nessential to life on earth. Thus, their\ndiscovery is a pioneering leap for\nunderstanding the origin of life and\nhow our prebiotic molecules are\nbuilt in the universe. The next stage\nis to observe which handedness is of\nexcess; stay tuned as more exciting\ndiscoveries are sure to follow.\nMcGuire & Carroll. 2016 @ Science\nCats know their\nphysics\nChiral space\nmolecules\nN\new research from the\nUniversity of Montana\nsuggests that when it\ncomes to earthquakes,\nthings are even more complicated\nthan we originally thought.The team\nof scientists looked at GPS records\nof surface motion during the 2015\nGorkha earthquake, that ravaged\nNepal, killing over 8000 people.\nThey found that the earthquake\nfailed to rupture the Himalayan\nfaults (planar fractures) and\nresulted in afterslip which released\naseismic-movement equivalent to\na magnitude 7.1 earthquake. Such\n\u2018incomplete\u2019 earthquakes seem to\nhappen quite frequently and are\nthe main reason behind geological\nshifts. The research, albeit shedding\nlight on the inner workings of\nearthquakes, also highlights the fact\nthat we are even worse at predicting\nearthquakes than we thought.\nMencin et al. 2016 @ Nature\nGeoscience\nPredicting\nearthquakes\nI\nf you haven\u2019t already, I implore\nyou all to read The Diet\nMyth by Tim Spector, the\nacclaimed work by professor\nof genetic epidemiology and\nconsultant physician (sadly at a\nrival university here in London).\nIt finely elucidates all the factors\nwhich play gargantuan roles in the\nway we react to and absorb all the\nnutrients in the food we eat. One\nchapter on the nutritional benefits\nof mushrooms particularly intrigued\nme, for reasons more than merely\nspore-related. Namely, the way we\ncan develop yoghurt specific to our\nvaginal microbial population, to\nward off fungal infection. Yum.\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. Fungi\nsuch as mushrooms are basically\nlarge collections of microbes that\nfeed off dead or decaying matter\nin the soil, in order to grow and\nreproduce. They also happen to\nadore living off humans as well.\nNo use fretting over mushrooms\nsprouting all over you, though\nsomething of the sort can happen\non a minor scale if you don\u2019t, say,\ndry your feet and in between your\ntoes properly, since these critters\nthrive on moisture and humidity.\nAll that aside, fungi also live in\nour gut as yeasts. Nothing to worry\nabout here either, since they live\nhappily in a symbiotic relationship\nwith the microbes that reside there.\nHowever, with improper antibiotic\ntreatment usually administered\nin an effort to correct the yeast\npopulation (very typical in Chinese\nmedicine), it\u2019s easy to throw off\nthe delicate balance of our natural\nmicrobe flora. These microbes help\ndefend against fungal infection,\nand minute populations of yeast are\ninvaluable to our body\u2019s immune\nsystem. This leads to dangerous\nand severe fungal infections such as\ncandida, usually seen on the mouth\nand tongue. Candida of the vagina\n(also known as thrush) is actually\nquite a normal part of being female,\nfor it develops at some point in\na female\u2019s life, though it\u2019s nicely\nwarded off by our friendly gut\ninhabitants lactobacillus bacteria.\nCould you perhaps recall the food\ntype teeming with lactobacillus?\nYoghurt is probably the first thing\nthat comes to mind. The popular\nprobiotic was tested as a treatment\nfor candida in randomized trials,\nhowever, most cases have not been\nparticularly successful, purely\nbecause each individual\u2019s microbe\npopulation is incredibly diverse\nand differs between individuals.\nThus, immunologists have started\ndeveloping vaginal yoghurt\n\u2013 yoghurt containing specific\nlactobacillus strains resembling the\nrather specialised vaginal microbe.\nWe can ingest this tangy concoction\nto ward off candida infections, and\nthis could also potentially help fight\ninfections like HIV and AIDS.\nDessert, anyone?\nSelf explanatory. Photo Credit: Mark Freeth\nIs vaginal yoghurt the future?\nAlexandra Lim\nWriter\nW\ne all witnessed\nthe devastating\neffects of the\n2008 economic\ncrisis, as ordinary people lost their\njobs and homes, and saw their\nhard-earned savings and financial\nsecurity evaporate. Now a team of\nresearchers are warning that the\nfinancial collapse may have also\nled to the preventable deaths of\nhundreds of thousands of people.\nWith the NHS already facing\nenormous pressure and under\nthreat from cuts from disingenuous\npoliticking, this discovery doesn\u2019t\nbode well for the UK. In a study\npublished recently in The Lancet,\nresearchers uncovered damning\nlinks between slashed public health\nspending, unemployment, and\n160,000 cancer-related deaths in\nthe EU alone in the fallout of the\nrecession.\nThe team analysed data from the\nWorld Bank and World Health\nOrganisation from 1990-2010\nfor almost 80 countries with\ndifferent incomes and healthcare\nsystems, accounting for over two\nbillion people. They compared\nhealthcare spending leading up to\nand following the recession with\ndeaths from different types of\n\u2018treatable\u2019 and \u2018untreatable\u2019 cancers.\nUnemployment and funding cuts\nwere markedly tied to increased\ncancer mortality, and countries\nwithout universal healthcare, like\nthe United States, fared much\nworse.\n\u201cThe US actually spends three\ntimes as much per person on\nhealthcare than the UK,but the issue\nis that it doesn\u2019t provide universal\nhealthcare coverage\u2026we found\nthat between 2008 and 2010, the\nUK didn\u2019t experience any additional\ndeaths, whereas the US experienced\naround 18,000 additional cancer\ndeaths \u2013 we believe \u2013 because of\nthe economic crisis,\u201d explained lead\nauthor Dr.Mahiben Maruthappu of\nImperial College, Senior Fellow to\nthe CEO of NHS and a practicing\ndoctor.\nConnections between healthcare\navailability and mortality might\nseem obvious to those of us who\nhave experienced difficulties\naccessing adequate care or\nmacroeconomic studies are not\nshowing direct cause and effect.\nRather, they hint at indirect but\npotentially lethal ripples in the wake\nof economic collapses.\nAs a result, scientists are keen to\ndo more research about what has\nhappened since 2010, considering\nthe \u201ceffects of the economic crisis\nhave been quite long-lasting and\nglobal unemployment remains\nsignificantly higher than before\u201d,\naccording to Maruthappu.\nStill, it\u2019s a compelling argument\nthat universal healthcare actually\nprotects human lives during tougher\neconomic times, \u201cbecause when\nyou factor it in, the link between\nunemployment and cancer mortality\ndisappears,\u201d said Maruthappu.\nIf this study holds true, and future\ndata shows that a lack of universal\nhealth care coverage does lead\nto cancer-related deaths that are\notherwise preventable, government\nattempts to reduce NHS services\nand access is something British\ncitizens will want to be wary of.The\nNHS may not be a perfect system,\nbut in the face of pending economic\nuncertainty like that of Brexit, it\nmay literally save our lives.\ntreatment. But previous studies in\nglobal \u2018healthconomics\u2019 have only\nlooked at deaths related to higher\nlevels of stress,like suicide and heart\ndisease.This study is first of its kind\nto isolate cancer in this light.\nOther researchers have been\ncynical of the study, and cautioned\nagainst over-generalisations. Dr.\nEliana Barrenho,a health economist\nat Imperial College London, said\nusing cancer rates as a health\nmeasure can produce distorted\nresults because \u201cthe distribution of\nprevalence and mortality of these\nare not homogeneous across the\nglobe\u2026 [and] richer countries with\nmore access to health care have\nshowed higher levels and degrees\nof cancer screening which, per se,\nmight increase incidence\u201d.\nThese concerns were echoed by\nDr. Laurence Roope, a development\neconomist at the University of\nOxford. However, he did also say\nthat the findings were still very\nplausible and \u201cit\u2019s obvious that\naccess to good quality healthcare\nis what matters to whether or not\npeople survive\u201d.\nStudy authors acknowledged\nthese limitations, arguing that these\nUniversal\nhealthcare\nactually\nprotects\nhuman\nlives during\ntougher\neconomic\ntimes\n\n"

All this was\nhappening while I\u2019m slaving away in\nthe totally unglam Central Library\nfacing debt and unemployment. I\nknow. Life is unfair.There, there.\nAs some of you may know, I am\nactually a blogger myself, disguised\nas a Chemical Engineering student\nrunning up and down ACEX every\nday.I am by no means famous in any\nway, but with a year of slow growing\nexposure in the world of social\nmedia, I have finally landed my first\ntaster of that mysterious lifestyle:\na summer cocktail press event\nat Shoryu, a hip Japanese ramen\nrestaurant/cocktail bar owned by\nJapan Centre with various locations\nincluding SoHo, Covent Garden,\nLiverpool Street and Carnaby\nStreet.\nTo be exact, it was, according to\nthe PR manager who contacted\nme personally a few weeks before,\na two-hour Summer Cocktails and\nMasterclass Blogger Event held in\ntheir SoHo branch conveniently\nin the evening after my last exam\n(woohoo!). All complete with\nan opportunity to \u201cinteract with\nThe four summer-themed cocktails available at Shoryu Soho. Photo Credit: Christy Lam\nfellow press people in the industry\u201d,\nwhile tasting their \u201cdelicious range\nof Japanese cocktails alongside\na delicate array of exquisite\naccompaniments\u201d. Also known as\nfree food, free booze, and party in\nstudent language.\nAfter a shy peek through the main\nentrance, I was greeted by a friendly\nmanager who quickly led me\nthrough the restaurant and down\nto the secretive, dimly lit basement\nwhich housed the press room.\nIt was more of an intimate\nevent than the big, fancy party I\nhad imagined. Two tables were\nbeautifully set with mini cocktail\nglasses,side plates and chopsticks all\nready for the proceeding drinking\nand dining.\nThe bar manager, who has worked\nin Japan and has thorough expertise\nin all things sake (a Japanese\nwine made by fermenting rice),\nintroduced us to the history of the\nrestaurant and her inspirations for\nher four summer creations, pouring\nin the various components into her\ncocktail shaker as she spoke. The\nwaitresses dished out bowls of sea-salted edamame, plates of freshly\nmade California rolls, and platters\nof their signature pork belly buns to\ncompliment the alcohol.\nThe cocktails were, of course,\nstrongly influenced by Japanese\nflavours and summer fruits. Even\nthe names had Japanese references.\nFirst up was Akai Rhubarb (with\nakai meaning red in Japanese),\nwith shots of Josen sake, Bombay\ngin, and Aperol, shaken hard with\nhomemade rhubarb syrup, served in\na white wine glass and two rhubarb\nstalks. Like the name, the cocktail\nwas a beautiful light red with\nbittersweet notes.\nNext was Natsu No Watermelon\n(meaning summer watermelon).\nFresh watermelon and strawberry\njuice was mixed with Cointreau\nand Shochu (a Japanese distilled\nalcohol) and served in a martini\nglass with a sprig of orange peel.\nStrong, but fruity, juicy and fresh\ntasting in a sunset coral red, perfect\nwhen paired with their tonkotsu\nramen.\nThe third cocktail, my favourite,\nwas Nikkei Rose, made from\nnamasake (unpasteurized sake),\nPisco, fresh grapefruit juice, syrup,\nand rosewater in coupe glass with\ntwo dried roses floating on top.This\nwas in a delicate pastel pink, mild\nand sweet, designed to be paired\nwith sushi.\nFinally, Mango Suppai (suppai\nmeans sour). This was probably the\nmostcomplexintermsofingredients\nand flavour. Yuzu Umeshu (yuzu is\nan oriental citrus fruit and Umeshu\nis a liqueur made from steeping\nplums in Shochu) is infused with\ngenmai tea (also known as popcorn\ntea here) beforehand, then shaken\nwith Frangelico hazelnut liqueur,\nJosen sake, and fresh mango, served\nin a rocks glass embellished with\nblackberries and a single bamboo\nleaf. A surprising balance between\nthe sweet mango and nutty\nFrangelico on the palette.\nShots of the cocktails were served\nfor all to try and the remaining\ntime was free for us to socialize\nand to take photos. It was the first\ntime I felt completely relaxed with\nmy blogging business. The hidden,\nembarrassed photo-taking sessions\ntransformed into bold, stand-up,\nhipster style aerial shots, perfect for\n#tablesituation.\nThe event quickly came to an end.\nWe were sent home with generous\ngoodie bags and a bottle of Matcha\nCool Down (matcha green tea\nmixed with Malibu). After talking\nto a few honest people who actually\nblog as a career, I realized that my\nperceptions of this social media\nlifestyle was completely wrong. It\nisn\u2019t as easy and glamourous as it\nappears to be on the pages of those\nglossy magazines. Not everyone can\nbecome famous overnight \u2013 many\nbuilt up their reputation by years of\ndedication, commitment and hard\nwork. It means constantly paying\nattention to the trends, comments,\nreviews, and discovering new places\nthat no one has been to before,\nand brainstorming new ideas for\ncaptions or articles or videos. Not\nevery photo or video is perfect \u2013\nthat 10-minute video could have\ntaken hours of preparation, filming\nand editing. That effortless #ootd\nphoto may not be so effortless after\nall.\nTaking account of all the risks\ninvolved in working in social media,\nwould I still continue with blogging\nand developing my hobby into a\npotential career? I certainly would.\nCHRISTY LAM\nThe signature pork belly buns complement the drinks. Photo Credit: Christy Lam\n\n"

This newspaper has been\nan important part of my experience\nhere, back from the very first copy I\nacquired in freshers\u2019 week and kept\nbecause it had the instructions on\nhow to operate washing machines.\nFELIX has given me much,\nthough I never figured out at which\npoint of the cycle you have to put\nthe softener in, and it has afforded\nme space for some rambling articles\nthat wouldn\u2019t be out of place on\nan unread hipster blog, but which\nthanks to FELIX allow me to add\n\u201camateur journalist/writer\u201d to my\nCV and keep a straight face.\nIt has given me so much that\nperhaps I can try to give something\nback; maybe I can pass my wisdom\nto the next generation on one of\nthe skills I have found most useful\nduring my time here: DJ-hood.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re at a party, or in the\nlaboratory,or in some other location\nwhere Spotify or an iPod has been\nhooked up and music is being\nplayed. Sure, you could let that\nplaylist go on until it gets to those\nbands with more glockenspiels than\nfollowers, but isn\u2019t it better to stand\nnext to a computer all night, trying\nto come up with a new song every\nthree minutes?\nHere's my\nfirst tip:\nnever put\nany kind of\nmetal on\nThere are some song everyone will sing along with \u2013 whether you like it or not.\nPhoto Credit: music.bligoo.es\nYour first instinct might be to put\non music that you like, and if you\u2019re\nlike many people at Imperial you\nmight want to put some metal on.\nHere\u2019s my first tip: never put any\nkind of metal on. No Maiden, no\nMetallica, no Priest. It\u2019s long and\nriff-heavy and screamy and generally\nnot good for casual gatherings\nof people \u2013 unless it\u2019s specifically\nmetal fans, in which case metal will\nalready be on. Good job, go back to\ndrinking.\nThe same usually goes for techno,\ndance and electronic music. In most\ncontexts, it won\u2019t be any good unless\npeople are drunk and dancing, in\nwhich case anything with a strong,\nfast, repetitive bassline will do. The\nProdigy tends to be appropriate\nin these circumstances, as a lot of\npeople will recognise their songs\neven if they are not especially\nfamiliar with them.\nThat is the key to being a good iPod\nDJ: good but recognisable songs. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s something you\npersonally ended up loving after\nthe twentieth repeat, slightly tipsy\npeople will enjoy a song more if they\ncan vaguely remember the words to\nit and hum out the tune. Most of\nThe Beatles fall into this category,\nas does virtually everything on\nMichael Jackson\u2019s Thriller.\nSongs that appeal to '90s kids'\ninclude 'Smells Like Teen Spirit',\n'Song 2' and 'The Rockafeller\nSkank'; other older but well known\npieces are 'Should I Stay Or Should I\nGo', 'Superstition', 'Fortunate Son',\n'Satisfaction', and many others. The\nabsolute king of this class of songs\nis 'Don\u2019t Stop Me Now' by Queen,\nwhich virtually everyone knows and\nloves and will dance to. And I can\nalso guarantee you that everyone\nwill be dancing to the 'Infernal\nGalop' by Offenbach.\nBut don\u2019t get too hung up on the\nspecific songs: there are just too\nmany to recount here.Build a mental\nlibrary of good pieces, switch up the\ngenres and, most importantly, look\nat the people. If they\u2019re bouncing,\ntapping their feet, singing along,\nthen it means you\u2019re doing a good\njob; if not, switch it up, change type\nof song, try something else.\nOr maybe you could mingle\nwith others and talk to them\ninstead of trying to dictate what\neveryone listens for the night.\nRather than getting hung up on the\nentertainment, you could actually\nget to know other people and dance\nwith them instead of staying in the\ncorner and watching them dance?\nNah. I was the iPod DJ most of\nthe time, and it ended up alright\nfor me. I\u2019m writing for FELIX an\narticle that can be summed up as\n\u201cGood songs are good\u201d: does it get\nany better than this?\nSo goodbye, Imperial and\nImperialites, I hope that I might\nhave entertained you at some point\nand taught you something. So long,\nand be good.\nSwitch up\nthe genres\nand, most\nimportantly,\nlook at the\npeople\nThese guys don't want Simon & Garfunkel.

Shadowy\nTTIP lowering our standards\nof welfare and increasing the\ninfluence of US megacorporations\nbehind closed doors. Imperialist\nattitudes towards an EU superstate\nsuch as those of former European\nCommission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel\nBarroso: \u201cI like to compare the EU\nas a creation to the organisation of\nempire. We have the dimension of\nempire.\u201d\nLast but not least, the treatment\nof the Greek people,who repeatedly\nhave austerity forced down their\nthroats in the name of the EU ideal\nof neocapitalism.\nThe lack of democracy exhibited\nabove can only be outdone\nby the sheer ineptitude of the\ndemocratic system we face at home,\nhowever, and it\u2019s the effect that\nthis referendum will have on our\ndomestic affairs that we really need\nto worry about. After all, the House\nof Commons Library determines\nthat an \u201caverage of 13.2% of UK\ninstruments are EU-related\u201d (with\n\"instruments\" referring to laws, acts\nand regulations). We need to focus\non the 86.8% that we make.\nWith the SNP controlling 54 of\nthe 59 seats in the former labour\nstronghold of Scotland, and the\nMurdoch press (who have backed\nevery general election victor since\n1979) thoroughly blue,the prospects\nof a Labour win at the next general\nelection seem bleak. So bleak, in\nfact, that as someone who considers\nhimself at the very least left-leaning,\nI find myself genuinely caring for\nthe first time in my life about which\nseemingly interchangeable \u2018old boy\u2019\nleads the Tories.\nDoes anyone benefit from #sabblife?\nThe sabbs are a financial drain\non college and an emotional\ndrain on everyone around them\nA vote to leave the EU would be\nseen by all as a massive vote of no\nconfidence in Cameron\u2019s Britain.\nThe disarmingly likable buffoonery\nof Boris would be vindicated. He\nwould undoubtedly become leader\nof the Conservative party before the\nyear was out.\nNobody knows what Boris really\nstands for \u2013 he is unquestionably\npopulist in his approach to politics.\nIt is the harshness of his fellow\nconservative leave campaigners\n(who will all be in line for massive\npromotions should we vote to\nleave) that I fear: Michael Gove, a\nproud Zionist, NHS hater and pro-intervention zealot; and Priti Patel,\na thinly-veiled lobbyist for the\ntobacco and alcohol industries.\nI never thought I\u2019d find myself in\na position where I\u2019d be clamouring\nfor the longevity of Dodgey Dave,\nbut that\u2019s the situation I find myself\nin now. If you thought the cuts were\nbad with Dave in charge, just you\nwait till Gove, Johnson & Co. get\ntheir hands on the country\u2019s assets.\nDo you actually want these people to be in charge? Photo Credit: The Guardian\nS\nabbatical officers at every\nuniversity are the same.\nThey\u2019re all self-important,\negotistical, and narcissistic,\nwith an inflated sense of the\nimportance of their role. They enter\nthis multi-generational circle-jerk\nof sabbs, stroking each other\u2019s egos\nand sucking each other\u2019s dicks, both\nliterally and metaphorically.\nSome of our sabbatical officers are\ngreat: they care about the students,\nand they manage to implement\nsome changes during their year in\nthe role. But let\u2019s face it, most of\nthem don\u2019t. Most of them spend\nthe year sitting in meetings they\ndon\u2019t contribute to, drinking in\nthe union bar as early as they can\npossibly get away with,and building\nrelationships with the rest of the\nBeit Quad Cartel, which ends up\nbeing a pool of people that they will\nfuck throughout the next few years\nuntil they fade into insignificance.\nAnd why is it that we pay them so\nmuch money to do this?\nHaving sabbatical officers is great,\nin theory. Having \u2018students\u2019 who\nengage with the mechanics of the\nUnion and represent the interests\nof the student body is essential\nto its function. But the Union\nitself strangles this intention by\npreventing the sabbs from having\nany real power to make even slight\nchanges to anything, while at the\nsame time telling them constantly\nthat they are all-important. What\nthis means is that instead of actually\nhelping students, they delude their\nsmug selves into thinking that\nthey\u2019re making a difference when\nall they\u2019re actually doing is adding\nto the incestuous links on the sabb\nsex map.\nAs students, we don\u2019t really gain\nmuch from them apart from the\nincorrect, yet comforting idea that\nmaybe someone might be looking\nout for our interests. Are the sabbs\nat least gaining anything from\ntheir year in power? Does being a\nsabbatical officer act as a training\ncentre for the real world?\nBeing a sabb looks great on your\nCV, for sure. You probably do gain\nsome #transferableskills that will\nhelp you in a future workplace\nenvironment, although in this case,\nthese are mostly 1) wearing suitable\nwork attire instead of jeans and\na ripped freebie t-shirt, 2) being\nable to show up to work at 9am\neven when you\u2019re still drunk from\nthe night before, and 3) being\narrogant enough to assume that\nany contributions you make in this\ncondition are worthwhile.\nBut beyond becoming entitled\nenough to think that this role makes\nthem a better person, sabbs seem\nto suffer for their year. For many\nof them, their mental health goes\ndownhill, their grades take a swift\nnosedive (if they are undertaking\nthis year in the middle of their\ndegree), and god only knows how\nmany STIs are being passed back\nand forth as ex-sabbs shag in various\npermutations at every Union social\nevent that they still feel the need to\nattend despite their long being old\nnews.\nAs an entity spanning beyond\ntheir year of service, sabb culture is\nbleak. So many of them stay stuck\nin the Imperial College Union circle\nforever, because they can\u2019t exist in\nthe real world because there, no one\ncares what they\u2019re doing.\nThey enter\nthis multi-generational\ncircle-jerk of\nsabbs\nAnonymous\nWriter\n\n"

She is, as the\ntitle of the play suggests, stuck\nbetween a newfound lover and her\nhusband. The play is a strange but\nintriguing one which explores the\ndifficult relationship the trio shares,\ncentred of course around Hester.\nThe husband, a high-ranking judge,\nmakes matters more complicated\nbecause of the stigma attached to\ndivorce. This beautiful play was\nwritten by the renowned playwright\nTerence Rattigan, and has its\nroots in his own difficult personal\nexperiences. Carrie Cracknell\u2019s\ndirection is brilliant and reveals the\ncomplex emotions of Hester and\nthose close to her, the performance\nis multidimensional, both in its\ncharacters, and even in its scenery.\nThe play is intricately subtle with\ncast and direction doing it the justice\nit deserves.Hester is played by Helen\nMcCrory, and her performance is,\nin a word, astounding. She conveys\nwith the utmost authenticity the\nturbulent emotions of a troubled\nthrough. Her interaction with the\nother characters, especially the two\nmen in her life, are realistic and,\nmore importantly, revealing.\nSir William Collyer, Hester\u2019s\nhusband, is portrayed by Peter\nSullivan as a stalwart man who\nholds his standing in society in the\nutmost regard,he seems formal with\nHester, and oddly seems to regard\nher relationship with her lover,\nFreddie Page, very much as a matter\nof fact rather than something to be\nresented. However, there are times\nwhen deeper feelings do manage\nto penetrate his upright exterior.\nIn sharp contrast Mr Page, played\nby Tom Burke, comes across as\nerratic , possibly due to his personal\ntroubles working as an RAF test\npilot. Collyer\u2019s relationship with\nher lover is passionate at times, and\nthere are sporadic bouts of longing,\nlusty desire. However, these are\noften restrained by the shackles of\nthe past, and of the sticky situation\nthat incarcerates them.\nAnother interesting character is\nMr Miller, a doctor struck-off for\nmysterious reasons, who seems to\nshare a lot more in common with\nHester than might first appear.\nNick Fletcher manages to play the\ntalkative landlady are almost\ninappropriately funny at times.\nEven the more restrained characters\nsuch as Mr Miller had the audience\nlaughing out loud when, in response\nto being asked why Hester might\nhave tried to commit suicide, he\nstates sarcastically that \u201cshe wanted\nto die, I suppose\u201d. These clever\nsplashes of black humour make the\nshow a delight to watch.\nIt is also not only the characters\nwho are multidimensional. The\nscenery is creatively constructed\nconsisting of multiple different\nrooms, where simultaneous events\ntake place through smoky blue\nscreens, giving a sense of multiple\ngoings-on without ever being\ndistracting.I thought this was a great\naddition to the play helping to add\nrealism and possibly representing a\nphysical manifestation of Hester\u2019s\nown isolation, as indistinct shadows\nmoved about outside of her lonely\nabode.\nUntil September 21st\nat\nThe National\u2019s Lyttelton Theatre\nA cacophony\nof self-hatred,\ndepression\nand elation\nmind, a cacophony of self-hatred,\ndepression and elation, all fuelled\nby the hot rage of a full on mental\nwar between logic and love. Hester\nCollyer comes across as a strong\nwoman, but within lies a weak\nhelplessness in the face of this\nchoice. Helen McCrory\u2019s portrayal\nis exquisitely transparent; the\naudience knows and empathises\nwith exactly what Hester is going\nClever\nsplashes of\nblack humour\nmake the\nshow a delight\npart perfectly; soberly at times,\nand yet exposes Mr Miller\u2019s more\nsophisticated make-up in a heated\none-on-one confrontation with\nHester later on.\nThe show contains dark themes\nthroughout. Despite this, characters\nsuch as Mr Welch (Hubert Burton),\na middle-class husband, and Mrs\nElton (Marion Bailey), an overly-Dark Passions \u2013 Tom Burke and Helen McCrory in The Deep Blue Sea.

    "content": "is traditionally associated with light fun? The\nword \u2018game\u2019 itself stems from the Old English\n\u2018gamen\u2019, which means \u2018amusement\u2019, locating\nitself as radically opposed to the serious act\nof analysis. In her masterful essay Against\nInterpretation, Susan Sontag laments the\ndestructive power of the modern interpreting\ngaze. She argues that interpretation\nis constricting \u2013 a way of making art\n\u2018manageable\u2019 by taming the nervous anxiety\nit can provoke in the viewer. \u201cIn place of a\nhermeneutics,\u201d she writes, \u201cwe need an\nerotics of art\u201d.\nVideogames seem different, however.\nThe game designer is only limited by her\nimagination, and current technological\ndevelopments; by generating the code and\nalgorithms responsible for our experience,\ndevelopers are able control every aspect\nof a virtual world. While many other forms\nof art allow the makers to reflect the world,\ngame design allows artists to create a world.\nAs media academic Gonzalo Frasca writes,\n\u201csimulator authors are not only creators, but\nalso legislators, because they decide which\nrules will apply to their systems\u201d. As such,\nvideogames demand interpretation, but The\nSims goes one further: where a work aims to\nstraightforwardly reproduce life, examining\nthe aspects of the simulacrum that make us feel\nuneasy can provide us with important lessons.\nLived reality may provide the inspiration for\nThe Sims, but The Sims can provide us with\ninsights into our own existence. In the words\nof Frasca: \u201cvideogames could become a\nmirror where players could look for answers\nto the problems of their lives\u201d. The fact that\nthe MoMA included The Sims in the original\n14 videogames acquired as part of their\nArchitecture and Design Collection, only\nspeaks to the importance of The Sims to the\nwider world. And this is why I believe it is\nimportant to critically interrogate The Sims; to\ninterpret it, and locate it within a conceptual\nframework, allowing us to identify what the\ngame is trying to say, and what we are able\nto hear as players.\n\u00a7\nT\nhe fact that my clearest memory of\nThe Sims is of a fire seems fitting,\nsince it was a fire that provided the\nimpetus for designer Will Wright\nto create the game. In 1991, a firestorm\nraged across the hillsides of Oakland, central\nCalifornia. A combination of dry, hot weather,\nand brisk gusts of wind \u2013 a type of weather\ncharacteristic of the area; Joan Didion\nwrote of it: \u201cthe wind shows us how close to\nthe edge we are\u201d \u2013 lead to a wildfire that\ndestroyed an area twice the size of the City\nof London, before being brought under. More\nthan three thousand homes were destroyed in\nthe fire, among them Wright\u2019s. At the time,\nWright was a successful game designer and\nco-founder of the studio Maxis. His breakout\ngame, SimCity, was released in 1989. A\nsimulation game that put the player in charge\nof designing a metropolis, kick-started the city-building game, and was an instant success.\nFollowingthelossofhishouse,Wrightneeded\nto rebuild, and this provided the inspiration for\na home-design simulation game; initially titled\nDoll House, the game was a straightforward\nbuilding simulation, an architect\u2019s toolbox.\nSomewhere along the line, Wright realised\nthat it would be more interesting for people\nto control the building\u2019s inhabitants, and thus\nThe Sims was born. Released on 4th\nFebruary\n2000 to rave reviews, it quickly became one\nof the best-selling PC game of all time, shifting\na total of 11.24 million units. Expansion packs\nfollowed, such as The Sims: Unleashed,\nwhich introduced pets, and The Sims: Hot\nDate, which added a \u2018downtown\u2019 area to\nthe neighbourhood. A sequel was released\nin 2004, then another in 2010, and the most\nrecent iteration, The Sims 4, hit the shelves\nthree years ago \u2013 all have been resounding\nsuccesses for Maxis, but none have come\nclose to the innovation and success of the first\niteration.\nThe Sims sits uneasily among the canon of\nvideogame classics. Typically, the experience\nthe game developer aims to provide is one\nthat acts as a radical departure from our\nnormal lives, from the exploration of ancient\nruins in Lara Croft, to running and gunning in\nGrand Theft Auto. Even in the earliest games,\nplayers were thrust into improbable scenarios,\nwhether it be the earth-defence mission of\nSpace Invaders, or the hallucinatory endless\nlabyrinths of Pac-Man. In sharp contrast, The\nSims simply aims to replicate the player\u2019s\nlife. We are able to create little avatars of\nourselves, and spend our downtime watching\nthem live out lives similar to our owns; in a\nmeta-twist, The Sims 4 allows sims to play\nThe Sims on their own computers. The Sims\ntherefore provides us with that most mundane\nand complex of fantasies: real life.\nThe central theme of The Sims is work.\nOnce your family has been created, they are\nprovided with the arbitrary sum of 20,000\nsimoleons (\u00a7), the in-game currency, with\nwhich to buy a property. Presumably, the\nsimoleon was used as a stand in for any\nreal life currency, but given the fact that the\nneighbourhood consists of archetypes of\nAmerican vernacular architecture set against\nan isometric suburbia, you\u2019d be forgiven for\nmerely viewing it as a pseudonym for the\ndollar. \u00a720,000 isn\u2019t much \u2013 just enough to\npurchase the house and furnish it with the\nmost basic of necessities.\nUpon opening \u2018Buy Mode\u2019, pausing the game\nand initiating catchy music, you are presented\nwith a selection of different objects, ranging\nfrom cheap plastic flamingos and lawn chairs\nto modern sculptures and plush sofas. Those\nitems that you cannot afford are visible, but\ncovered in a forbidding red filter \u2013 like in all\nconsumerist societies, the objects you need,\nor are told you need, are dangled just out of\nyour reach. Since the cheapest objects impact\nnegatively on your sims\u2019 \u2018Room\u2019 mood score,\nand generally fail to efficiently satisfy their\nneeds, The Sims forces the player to adopt an\naspirational mind-set, wherein they pine for\nflat screen TVs and matching dining sets. Add\nto this the fact that utility bills continually pile\nup, and the player is left with no other option\nthan to force their sims to work.\nWhile some areas of The Sims are close\napproximations to reality, other aspects are\nbeguiling. One such feature is the lack of\nweekendsortimeoff:foryoursims,everysingle\nday is a working day, and any relaxation must\nbe done in the period between clocking off\nfrom the job and going to bed, preparing for\nanother day of labour. The seven expansion\npacks to the game added in Frankenstein\nmonsters and genies, magic spells and movie\nsuperstars, but did not include the concept of\n\u2018retirement\u2019. The sims must work every day\nof their lives, which \u2013 provided there are no\naccidents, are endless. A lifetime of work\nwithout end stretches out before us like a Kafkaesque nightmare. The closest comparison\nin the world of videogames I can think of is\nMolleindustria\u2019s Every Day The Same Dream,\na short art-house game in which you control a\nfaceless individual navigating a grey world of\nrepetitive work, and disenchanted by modern\nalienation of labour. It makes its point in a\nradically different way to The Sims, but both\nshare a deep sense of unease.\nThe Sims itself doesn\u2019t have victory\nconditions; there is no actual \u2018end\u2019 to the\ngame, which can continue as long as the\nplayer\u2019s attention-span allows. However,\nit is possible to reach the \u2018end\u2019 of a career,\npast which point your sim will no longer be\npromoted. Promotions are achieved through\nincreases in both the number of friends a sim\nhas, and their relevant skills \u2013 a hearts and\nminds approach to career development, if you\nwill. The \u2018Politics\u2019 career path, for example,\nrequires high levels of charisma, as well as\nhuge numbers of friends \u2013 in The Sims, as in\nreal life, it\u2019s all a popularity contest. The result\nof this mechanism is to transform features of\nlife like friendship and knowledge, which are\ntraditionally viewed as intrinsically valuable,\ninto things possessing mere instrumental\nvalue. Friends are only used to secure your\nnext promotion; knowledge is a means of\nincreasing your sim\u2019s labour value.\nThe centrality of work to The Sims can be seen\nin the etymological myth that has surrounded\nthe company. Although untrue, many believe\nthat \u2018Maxis\u2019 refers to 6 AM spelt backwards, a\nlegend actively encouraged by the easter egg\nin SimCity 3000 that stated \u201cDo you know that\nMaxis spelled backwards is Six AM?\u201d 6 AM\nis, in Western society, heavily associated with\nthe beginning of the working day; the shrill\ntone of an alarm going off at such an early\nhour is, across a variety of media, indelibly\nlinked to the beginning of work. In The Sims,\nit is the time that your sims will naturally wake\nthemselves, ready to begin another day in\ntheir endless life of labour.\n\u00a7\nA\nnother key theme in The Sims is\nthat of simplification, which is\nunderstandable, given the vast\ndiversity of human life and the\nlimited processing power of computers.\nYour sim\u2019s personality is shrunk down to\nfive main characteristics: neatness, niceness,\noutgoingness, playfulness, and activeness.\nThe entire diversity of human temperament\nin The Sims is reduced to a balance, or\nimbalance, of these five factors. Similarly, the\nrealm of possible knowledge is represented\nby 6 different \u2018skills\u2019, which can be improved\nby interaction with objects; for example, a sim\nmay increase their logic skill by playing chess\nuntil the bar above their head fills up. Some\nhave criticised this as being far too simplistic,\nsuch as Janet Murray, the seminal digital\nmedia scholar, who said that humans were far\nmore complex than that. While undoubtedly\ntrue, one only has to look at the continuing\npopularity of psychometric tests, such as the\nMyers-Briggs classification, to see how many\nof us yearn to be reduced down to simpler\nindividuals.\nWhile The Sims may represent a radical\ndeparture from the goal-orientated action-based games of the 1990s, it has a number of\nfeaturesincommonwiththeRolePlayingGame\n(RPG) genre. Like RPGs, simulation games are\ncentred around an open-ended state of play,\none in which the \u2018end\u2019 is relative, and often set\nby the player. The Sims also shares with RPGs\nan emphasis on \u2018grinding\u2019 \u2013 an engagement\nin repetitive mechanical tasks in order to\nprogress to a new level. While traditionally\nassociated with MMORPGs, such as World of\nWarcraft and Runescape, The Sims uses the\ncareer path algorithm to encourage players\nto force their sims to repetitively work on their\nskills, in order to gain the points needed for\ncareer progression.\nSo far, so innocuous, but where the\ngrinding aspect in The Sims becomes more\nquestionable is in social interactions. The\nrelationship between two different sims may\nbe measured using the relationship bar, which\nspans from -100 (indicating mortal enemies)\nto 100 (indicating best friends); clicking on\nanother sim will open up a number of different\npossible interactions, which may be friendly,\nromantic, or mean. In order to increase your\nrelationship with another sim (an indirect form\nof \u2018levelling up\u2019, as it were), you will need to\nrepeat particular social interactions over and\nover again, ensuring that your conversational\npartner does not get bored. In real life,\ntelling someone seven jokes in a row will earn\nyou a bemused look, but in The Sims such\npractice is actively encouraged. By reducing\nhuman interaction, something so nuanced,\nso complex, to a series of grinding tasks,\nThe Sims encourages us to see relationships\nFigure 4: If your sims happen to perish, they will\nrecieve a visit from the Grim Reaper. They are given\nthe opportunity to \u201ccheat death\u201d by playing RockPaper-Scissors, but if they fail they are removed\nfrom the game, leaving behind ashes in an urn,\nand a mourning family.\nFigure 1: The Sims allows the player to create\nvirtual avatars, who can represent any number of\nreal-life individuals.

You\nmay have been surprised, but you\nwouldn\u2019t have let it show. And just\nlike that, we would order another\ndrink and me being gay would have\nbeen something normal. No big\ndeal.\nSo this shouldn\u2019t be an article. It\nshouldn\u2019t be a big deal. I shouldn\u2019t\nhave to publicly explore my\nsexuality with thousands of people\nwatching. But it feels irresponsible\nand immoral at this point not to.\nBecause a man killed 49 people on\nSunday in a gay club in Florida.\nPeople he viewed as deviant,\nundeserving of love, kindness, and\nin the end, the right to life. People\nlike me. He didn\u2019t know what their\nfavorite colour was. He didn\u2019t know\nif they liked dogs over cats.He didn\u2019t\nknow if they donated to charity, if\nthey wanted children, if they were\ndreamers, if they were good or bad\npeople. Would that have made a\ndifference?\nI am a person, you know me, and I am gay\nWhen I woke up on Sunday and\nread the news, although I wasn\u2019t\nthere, although I didn\u2019t know the\nvictims, I felt crushed in a way I\nnever thought I\u2019d feel. For the first\ntimeIfullyunderstoodhomophobia,\ndespite often having been a victim\nof it in the past. Despite strangers\non the street calling me disgusting\nfor daring to hold the hand of the\nman I loved in public.\nIt\u2019s hard to explain what\nhomophobia feels like, especially\nin the extreme form that it took on\nSunday. But imagine finding out\none day that someone hates you,\nwants you dead for no reason other\nthan that you dare exist. And now\nimagine this one person is actually\nhundreds of people. Thousands.\nMillions. From all over the world.\nPeople you don\u2019t know. People that\ndon\u2019t even know you exist. Yet they\nhate you.\nMany of these people will never\neven meet a queer person. Or so\nthey think, because so many gay\nmen and women live a lie,repressing\ntheir true identity in fear of being\nostracised or worse.In some extreme\ncases, repression can lead to denial,\ndelusion and self-rejection. So the\nhaters go on hating, unaware that\nsome of the people they love and\nadmire are gay; parents, siblings,\nfriends, idols.\nI told my youngest brother that\nI\u2019m gay on Monday. He lives in\nGreece so I couldn\u2019t do it face to\nface. My parents think he might\nstill be too young, but I was afraid\nto wait any longer.Afraid that in the\nabsence of a visible gay person in his\nlife, blind hate might take root in\nhis heart.\nGreece, despite its modern facade,\nissteepedintradition.Unfortunately\nthis can often manifest as sexism\nand homophobia. Although my\nimmediate family and friends\nI shouldn't\nhave to\npublicly\nexplore my\nsexuality\nknow (and have been extremely\nsupportive), the rest of my family\nback home is, I presume, blissfully\nunaware of my actual sexual\npreferences. Something unlikely to\nhave been helped by my own years\nof repression and confusion.\nIf I\u2019m honest, I\u2019ve been reluctant\nto come out to them. It\u2019s been\neasy. We live in different countries\nand our reunions are few and far\nbetween. I don\u2019t want to have to do\nthis. I don\u2019t want to be the source\nof polarisation in my family (does\nanyone?). I\u2019m afraid some of them\nmight be deeply homophobic. But\nmaybe if they knew, they wouldn\u2019t\nbe.\nSo today, even though I feel like\nI\u2019m still exploring love within myself\nand with others, even though I hate\nbeing pigeon-holed by a society that\nsometimes reveals itself as deeply\nintolerant, today I am a proud\ngay man. And my favorite color is\nturquoise.\nI love the sea, the life it harbours,\nthe feelings it evokes. I need colour\nin my life, when I wake up, when I\nwork, when I cook. My humor is at\nbest black and at worst lacking. My\nstyle is questionable. I like crumpets\nsmothered in butter. I used to only\ndrink lager, but I\u2019ve developed\na love for chocolate stouts. My\ndad is Greek, my mum is GreekAustralian. I like dogs, but only if\nthey\u2019re big. Otherwise I prefer cats.\nSo starting today you know me as\na human first and as a member of\nthe LGBTQ+ community second.\nAnd maybe next time someone\nsays fags are a plague you\u2019ll think of\nme and maybe you\u2019ll say \u2018No, that\u2019s\njust not right. This guy is wrong. I\nshould say something.\u2019\nAnd maybe you will say\nsomething. And maybe one day we\nwon\u2019t be hated.\nIn the\nabsence of\na visible gay\nperson in\nhis life, blind\nhate might\ntake root\nThe Orlando shooting is a harrowing reminder of the bigotry LGBTQ+ people face.

Along the way\nhe briefly mentions the difficulties\nfacing America, with a montage of\nfootage that runs from the Korean\nWar, all the way up to Eric Garner\u2019s\nlast moments.\nHe also gives statistics that \u2013 to\nUK ears \u2013 sound horrific, such as\nthe fact that systematic electoral\nmanipulation means that in states\nlike Florida,up to one in three black\nmen cannot vote. Those watching\nin Europe may feel smug, but they\ncannot escape culpability: at one\npoint, Moore lists the companies\nthat use American prison workers\u2013\nin effect modern slave labour \u2013\nincluding Microsoft and Delta\nAirlines.We are all Americans now;\nnone of us can take the moral high-ground.\nMoore concludes the film with\nthe bombastic claim that \u2013 surprise,\nsurprise \u2013 all these things are\nactually American ideas. While the\ntruth of this statement is certainly\ndebatable (despite the fact that\nwomen marched in support of the\nWhen Marnie Was\nThere\nDir: Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Script:\nMasashi Ando, Keiko Niwa.\nStarring: Sara Takatsuki, Kasumi\nArimura, Hana Sugisaki, Hitomi\nKuroki. 103 minutes.\nW\nhile Studio Ghibli\nhave gifted us\nwith numerous\nadaptations of\nchildren\u2019s tales, they have clearly\nnever come across The Boy Who\nCried Wolf. For the last few years,\nevery announcement of a new film\ncomes with a warning that this may\ntheir last. While the creative heart\nof the company, Hayao Miyazaki\nannounced his retirement in 2013,\nhe is still working to create short\nfilms,and \u2013 after all \u2013 he said exactly\nthe same thing in 1997. And so the\nnews that their latest, When Marnie\nWas There, is to be their last film for\nthe foreseeable future, does not fill\nme with dread; or maybe it\u2019s just\nwishful thinking, optimistically\nkeeping the truth at bay, for \u2013 most\ncan agree \u2013 that Studio Ghibli have\nmade some of the most technically\nimpressive, emotionally complex\nanimated films of the last half-century.\nBased on the novel by Joan G.\nRobinson, the film concerns Anna,\na young asthmatic girl who is sent\nfrom Sapporo to the rural seaside\ntown of Kushiro for her health;\nas well as her breathing, Anna\nis suffering from some kind of\nEqual Rights Amendment several\nyears before the election of Iceland\u2019s\nVigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir, I don\u2019t think\nAmerica can lay claim to the totality\nof the idea of women\u2019s rights),\nit serves to highlight Moore\u2019s\nwillingness to clearly display his\nideological heart on his sleeve.\nThis is a feature of Moore that is\nboth frustrating and endearing \u2013\nparticularly when you consider that\nmuch of Moore\u2019s work is borne\nfrom deep-seated frustration at the\ncurrent American administration,\nand a desire to better the lot\nof society\u2019s most marginalised\nindividuals.\nEnding the film like this, however,\nsimply begs the question: just\nwhere did America go wrong? And\nunfortunately for Moore, this is a\nmuch more interesting question\nthan the one he is asking. Moore\nworks much better when he looks\nto his home turf, such as in his\nexemplary Bowling for Columbine\nand Fahrenheit 9/11. In some ways,\nWhere to Invade Next? resembles his\n2007 film Sicko, which saw him look\nat European models of socialised\nhealthcare: both films carry with\nthem a certain cherry-picking\nsensibility, where Europe is made\nout to be some kind of paradise.\nWhere to Invade Next? works best as\na breezy examination of European\nsensibilities, but eschews any deeper\nlook at the problems of power\nstructures on both sides of the\nAtlantic, and does not seem to add\nanything new to the conversation.\nFRED FYLES\npsychological strain, linked to the\ndifficultrelationshipshehaswithher\nwell-meaning foster parents. With\na talent for drawing, Anna simply\nwants to be left alone, eschewing\nthe company of local children in\norder to sit for innumerable hours\nlooking across the salt marsh at the\nabandoned mansion, overgrown\nwith gothic sentiment.\nRowing across to the mansion one\nnight at high tide,she meets Marnie,\na young girl of the old-time-Europe variety (golden curls, bright\nblue eyes, pretty ruffled dresses),\nwith whom she immediately\nmakes friends. What follows is an\nexploration of the role of memories\nand the imagination: is Marnie a\nreal person? Or just a figment of a\nlonely child\u2019s imagination? These\nthemes, along with the strong\nindication that Anna has some\nkind of anxiety/depressive disorder,\nmakes this heavy-hitting stuff \u2013 the\nidea of exploring the mansion of\nher imagination makes me think of\na child-friendly remake of Jacques\nRivette\u2019s masterpiece, Celine and\nJulie go Boating \u2013 but it is a pity\nthat director Hiromasa Yonebayashi\ndoesn\u2019t follow up this initial promise.\nInstead all the loose ends of When\nMarnie Was There are tied up very\nneatly, with a near-implausible\nfamily revelation discovered at the\nend of the film. While naturally\nconstrained by the source material\u2019s\nplot, it would have been fantastic if\nthey could have held onto the eerie,\nunsettling atmosphere that made\nthe first half so captivating.\nFRED FYLES\nWhen Marnie Was There, apparently the 'last' of the Studio Ghibli films.

Photo Credit: Dog Eat Dog Films\nM\nuch like the braying\npoliticians slugging\nit out over the Brexit\ndebate currently\nraging, many films currently being\nreleased can be divided into two\ndistinct camps: there are those\nthat exploit the inherently visual\nnature of cinema, to create works\nthat are visually astonishing, while\nperhaps lacking in terms of plot\nand pacing \u2013 call them \u2018team look\u2019.\nAnd there are those that craft an\nengaging narrative, chock full of\ndelicious, naturalistic dialogue (or\nnot. Looking at you, Sorkin!) and\na plot that grabs the viewer, but an\nabsence of aesthetic flourish \u2013 call\nthem \u2018team plot\u2019.But there are those\nrare films that manage to combine\nboth worlds, resulting in a finished\nproduct that speaks to the viewer\non a number of different levels:\nvisually, culturally, intellectually, and\npersonally. Embrace of the Serpent is\nsuch a film.\nLoosely based around the journals\nof German ethnologist Theodor\nKoch-Gr\u00fcnberg and American\nethnobotanist Richard Evans\nSchultes, Embrace of the Serpent sees\nthe intertwining of two plotlines:\nin 1909, Theo (Jan Bijvoet) is\nterminally ill, and is combing the\nAmazon rainforest to try and find\nthe yakruna, a sacred plant that will\ncure him; in 1940, Evan (Brionne\nDavis) is researching plants in the\nsame area, and also trying to find\nthe yakruna, which possesses both\nhallucinogenic properties, and the\nability to increase the output of\nrubber trees on which it is grown.\nTheir stories are connected by\nKaramakate, a mystic shaman, and\nthe last of his tribe,who guides both\nmen through the forest. Just as the\nWesterners are searching for their\nplant, Karamakate is also searching\n\u2013 initially for members of his tribe,\nbut later on for mere memories of\nthem. The themes of memory and\nrebirth feature heavily in the film,\nas the main principles cycle around\neach other, tracing and retracing\nfamiliar paths.\nThe fact that the actor playing the\nolder Karamakate, Antonio Bol\u00edvar\nSalvador, is himself one of the last\nof the Ocaina people only adds\nemotional heft to what is already an\nincredibly charged film. Embrace of\nthe Serpent looks at the devastation\nWestern colonialism can wrought\non an area:the repeated references to\nthe rubber farms, the slaves tortured\nby plantation owners, the brutality\nof the leaders of the Christian\nmissions, the hysteria induced by\nmystic cults, which rushed in to fill\nthe gap left by the destruction of the\nindigenous religious. It all speaks to\nthe vast, indelible legacy left behind\nby colonialism, which Frantz Fanon\nincisively referred to as \u2018germs of\nrot\u2019, infecting both the minds of the\npeople and the very land itself.\nThe land, the particular nuances\nand idiosyncrasies of the Amazon\nbasin, form another key player in\nthe film. Its title is taken from an\nAmazonian myth, which states\nthat ancestral beings were brought\nto Earth on a giant anaconda, and\nwent into the Amazon to teach\nhumans how to live in harmony\nwith nature; the body of the\nanaconda became the Amazon\nriver, whose torturous paths cradle\nEmbrace of the Serpent offers up a visual, inellectual, and metaphysical feast. Photo Credit: Alamy\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nEmbrace of\nthe Serpent\nraises\nquestions\nabout the\npolitics of\npower\nEmbracing the depths of humanity\nEmbrace of the Serpent is a hallucinatory journey into the psyche of the Amazon\nindigenous communities. The two\nstories take place more than three\ndecades apart, but all that has really\nchanged is reflected in the jungle\u2019s\nhuman inhabitants; we can see\nthe passing of time in the lines on\nKaramakate\u2019s face, and the decay\nwrought on the Christian mission\u2019s\nbuildings, but the jungle remains\nthe same, unaffected by age, isolated\nfrom regular temporal progression.\nEmbrace of the Serpent raises\nquestions, therefore, not only of\nthe politics of power, and Western\ncolonisation, but also metaphysical\nones on the nature of reality \u2013 the\nheavy emphasis on the centrality of\nhallucinogenic plants to indigenous\nculture is a reflection of a different\ntrain of philosophical thought, one\nthat embraces the phenomenologist\nemphasis on consciousness and\nappearance.\nThe film's director Ciro Guerra\n(astonishingly, Embrace of the\nSerpent is only his third full feature\nfilm) handles such narrative\ncomplexities with extreme grace,\nand simultaneously manages to craft\none of the most visually astonishing\nfilms in recent memory. Nearly the\nentire film is shot in a brilliantly\ncrisp black and white, which reflects\nthe anthropological photographs\ntaken by explorers during the era,\nseveral of which appear during the\nfilm\u2019s credits.\nIn many ways, the closest\ncomparison the film evokes for me\nis the work of Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado,\nthe Brazilian photographer whose\nwork is a reflection on the epic and\nthe sublime power both of nature\nand of humanity. Cinematography\nDavid Gallego, who like Guerra,\nonly has a handful of credits to his\nname, has rendered the Amazon\nin exacting style, and the result is a\nmasterwork of visual force.\nEmbrace of the Serpent is that rare\nbeast: a film that manages to exploit\nthe formidable ability the camera\nhas to tell a story and raise questions,\nwhile still managing to be a wholly\nbeautiful work. Guerra takes us on\na hallucinatory journey into the\ndeepest part of the jungle, forcing\nus to confront the very nature of\npower and humanity. Embrace of\nthe Serpent is a film that leaves us\nhumbled, nourished, and sublimely,\nwonderfully, wholly enriched.\nEmbrace of the\nSerpent\nDir: Ciro Guerra. Script: Ciro\nGuerra, Jacques Toulemonde Vidal.\nStarring: Nilbio Torres, Jan Bijvoet,\nAntonio Bolivar, Brionne Davis.\n125 minutes.\n\n"

Always expertly\nacted, and consistently engaging;\nthe series is a must watch for anyone\nwho enjoys dramas or historical\npieces.\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\nsprings forth from the mind of Tina\nFey and 30 Rock producer Robert\nCarlock, Unbreakable maintains its\npredecessor\u2019s offbeat and unique\nflavour of humour. The show\ntracks the journey and struggle of\nKimmy Schmidt to fit into modern\nday New York, after having been\nkidnapped and locked in a bunker\nfor 15 years. This seemingly heavy\nset-up is handled deftly, and much\nof the comedy stems from Kimmy\u2019s\ninteractions with a colourful, yet\nstill believable, supporting cast. If\nyou liked 30 Rock, or are a fan of\nWes Anderson films, you\u2019ll like this.\n11.22.63 has a pedigree that is\nimmediately evident in the names\nattached to it; the series is based\non a Stephen King novel and stars\nJames Franco in the leading role. It\ncentres on a disenfranchised school\nteacher, who discovers a time-portal\nto 1960 in the back of a diner, and\nis persuaded to try and stop the\nKennedy assassination. He quickly\ndiscovers, however, that the web of\nconspiracy is more intricate than he\nis prepared for. And then there\u2019s the\nsmall matter that time itself does\nnot want to be changed.\nArcher can just about be summed\nup with the phrase \u2018James Bond as\nan ultra-alcoholic lovable asshole\u2019.\nHarry Wilkinson\nWriter\nNext up, we\nhave a few\nguys sitting\naround in\na forest,\nfingering\neach other\nThe Backstreet Boys reunion tour didn\u2019t go as well as hoped. Photo Credit: HBO\nThis week on Game of Thrones\nIt\u2019s season six, episode eight!\nW\ne\u2019re coming up to\nthe final episodes\nof the second to\nlast season of this\nshow and they apparently still have\nthe time to meander around for an\nepisode with nothing particularly\ninteresting happening. Ah well,\nhere\u2019s a recap anyway.\nWe open with Lady Crane giving\nher monologue as Cersei at Joff\u2019s\ndeath again, but we can see that\nshe took Arya\u2019s advice to bring\nanger to the scene. As she leaves the\nstage she finds Arya, stabbed and\nbleeding, in her bed asking for help.\nBit of a turnaround there. Two days\nago Arya decided to not murder her\nat the last minute then now she\u2019s\nbegging for medical help? Arya\nhas a quick chat about her career\naspirations before getting drugged\nup.\nNext up, we have a few guys\nsitting around in a forest, fingering\neach other. I love a bit of bromance.\nThe Hound marches in and puts a\nstop to that with some axework and\ncommits the definition of adding\ninsult to injury \u201cYou\u2019re shit at dying,\nyou know that?\u201d. Later he runs\ninto the guys that actually killed\nhis mates about to be executed\nby the Brotherhood without\nBanners (They are really liking the\nthrowbacks this season aren\u2019t they?)\nand Beric and Thoros allow him to\nkick them off their hanging blocks.\nGenerous blokes they are. I\u2019m\ninterested to see how this is going\nto join up into the bigger story.\nWe then have yet another scene of\nTyrion and Varys strolling through\nMeereen intellectually sparring\nbefore Tyrion says goodbye to Varys\nwho\u2019s going on some secret mission\nback to Westeros, apparently to get\nsome ships for Dany. Seems to me\nhe\u2019d be put to better use trying to\nactually find their Queen but hey,\nI\u2019m not the Master of Whispers.\nCersei\u2019s just having a nice sit down\nin the Red Keep with her massive\nzombie bodyguard when her cousin\nLancel shows up and lets her know\nthat Il Papa wants to see her in the\nSept. She disagrees. There\u2019s a short\nzombie fight scene before the monks\nall run away scared. She eventually\nshows up to the throne room and\nKevan tells her to fuck off up to\nthe balcony and all the other girls\nkeep their distance from her. She\u2019s\nlike the Regina George of King\u2019s\nLanding. Tommen announces that\nCersei and Loras are to have their\ntrials soon and that trial by combat\nisn\u2019t happening. She shits herself\nslightly at this announcement\n(as does anyone in favour of\nCleganebowl) then has an odd,\ncryptic conversation with her evil\nscientist friend. Continuing on the\nbromantic theme from earlier, we\nget a nice reunion of Bronn and Pod\nwhen Brienne turns up at Riverrun;\nBronn is totally sure they\u2019re fucking.\nI almost forgot about Podrick\u2019s\nmagic cock. Brienne enters Jaime\u2019s\ntent to have a quick catch up and\nshe tries to return Jaime\u2019s sword to\nhim but he declines. When they\nget down to business (not like that)\nshe reveals her plan to get Blackfish\nand the Tully army back up North,\nJaime\u2019s just like \u2018Look you can try\nif you like but that plan is awful\u2019.\nI\u2019m inclined to agree with that one.\nJust a little bit more sexual tension\nbetween the two before she heads\ninto the castle to talk to Blackfish.\nHe explains to her that he\u2019s not\ngoing to abandon his ancestral\nhome to travel all the way North to\ndie for his great-niece that he barely\nknows. Honestly, you could\u2019ve\npredicted that response Brienne.\nBack in Meereen Tyrion\u2019s using\npeer pressure to get his friends to\ndrink. Initially they refuse but he\ntells enough bad jokes that they\ndecide that they definitely are going\nto need to get drunk for this. Grey\nWorm goes for a bit of banter too\nbut his is so bad that the Wise\nMaster\u2019s begin bombarding the\nwhole city (ShitLAD). He freaks\nout at Tyrion\u2019s poor negotiating\nskills then Dany storms into the\npalace like a BAMF.\nBack to Riverrun and Jaime\u2019s\nchatting with Edmure Tully, first\noffering him a nice life in a castle\nbefore dropping the \u2018I will murder\nyour baby because I want to fuck my\nsister\u2019 bombshell. Edmure complies.\nAs soon as he lets himself back into\nhis castle he tells them all to bitch\nout of the fight so he can see his fit\nwife. Brienne escapes in a boat but\nthe Blackfish decides that he might\nas well die now in a blaze of glory.\nSadly, the show didn\u2019t have the\nbudget for that swordfight so we\nget the news when some random\nsoldier tells Jaime he died. We then\nget more sexual tension in the form\nof an awkward boat wave.\nWe finish up the episode with\nArya\u2019s surrogate mother being\nmurdered followed by the Waif\nchasing down Arya like the bloody\nTerminator, this ends poorly for the\nWaif. Arya then displays her face\nas a trophy for Jaqen, like when a\ncat kills a bird then drags its corpse\ninto your house. Honestly, this is\nprobably the weakest episode of the\nseason. There was a lot of wasted\ntime which you wouldn\u2019t expect\nso close to the end of the season,\nparticularly the Tyrion scenes could\nhave had much more purpose to\nthem. Oh well, next week we have\nThe Battle of the Bastards, that\nmuch be where the swordfighting\nbudget from this episode went.\n\t\t\t\t\nGame of Thrones is available on Sky\nAtlantic and Sky Go\nThis just says \u201cArmy pls?\u201d then a load of emojis. Photo Credit: HBO\nProbably\nthe weakest\nepisode of\nthe season\nA superbly animated parody of\nthe spy genre; the series chronicles\nthe misadventures of \u2018the world\u2019s\nmost dangerous spy\u2019, the titular\nSterling Archer. Featuring a stellar\nsupporting cast in the form of his\nco-workers at spy agency ISIS (2009\nwas a more innocent time); the show\ncould also easily be described as an\noffice-comedy a la, well, The Office.\nThere are excellent action sequences\nand consistently funny comedy that\nhas reached meme levels. Starring\nthe inimitable H. Jon Benjamin,\nthis seven season behemoth cannot\nbe recommended enough.\nBatman: The Animated Series, is\nperhaps the perfect distillation of\nthe Dark Knight in any medium.\nThis show is recommended for fans\nand newcomers alike. It manages\nto be dark, poetic, heartfelt, and\nhopeful all at once; capturing all\nthe angles of The Batman, and\nshowing just why it is he endures in\nthe public imagination. The series\nalso contains character defining\nportrayals of Batman and the Joker,\nfrom Kevin Conroy and Mark\nHamill (yes, Luke Skywalker). If\nBatman v. Superman left a bad taste\nin your mouth that you\u2019d like to\nwash out, or if you\u2019re just wondering\nwhat the big deal is with this Batguy, this is the one to watch.\nPsych is one of those \u2018special\ndetective\u2019 shows, where the lead\ncharacter is able to solve any crime\nby the power of being amazing.\nThankfully,it doesn\u2019t take its premise\nseriously and has lots of fun with it.\nShawn Spencer is the son of a police\nofficer,and a brilliant detective in his\nown right,who doesn\u2019t much care for\nthe commitment or discipline of the\nforce. So he pretends to be a psychic\ndetective who subcontracts on\ncases. Much of the humour comes\nfrom the excellent banter between\ncharacters, and the show features\none of the greatest bromances in\nTV history.\nTrueDetective,asitsnameimplies,\nis an anthology show, with each\nseries chronicling a different group\nof individuals dealing with crime.\nHauntingly atmospheric, frequently\npoetic, and always enthralling; the\nshow is a must watch for mystery\nbuffs. The first season is sublime,\nwith powerhouse performances\nfrom Mathew McCaughey and\nWoody Harrelson. But be careful;\njust do yourself a favour and avoid\nthe second season.\nIt\u2019s not a drinking problem if you never stop long enough to get hungover.

It is a towering,\nrotating artist\u2019s mannequin arm\nthat moves its joints at random\nThe tip of the sculpture carries a\nsmall camera that records its field\nof vision. The swooping images of\nsky, building, and exhibition-goers,\nseen as though through the eyes of\na bird flying, and diving through the\ncourtyard are replayed on a giant\nscreen that spans the entrance to\nthe Royal Academy. It\u2019s innovative,\nunusual, and focuses on the process\nof making art, a theme that the\nartist as someone who works alone.\nThe collaborative effort of creating\nart is highlighted in the central hall\nwhich contains the glittering neon\nsign by Noble and Webster, and also\nfeatures a fossilized petrol pump by\nAllora & Calzadilla.\nIncreasingly, the Summer\nExhibition mutates according to\nthe coordinator in charge. Last year,\nMichael Craig-Martin painted\nthe walls in neon colours; pink and\nturquoise. This year the walls have\nstayed white, presumably in order\nto let the works shine. Whether all\nthe works on display are shining\nexamples of great art is up for debate.\nThe quality of the work varies\nwildly from room to room, which\nhave been broadly designated by\nmedium.Two print rooms lead onto\na space for photography, another\nfor architecture, whilst sculpture is\nplaced throughout the gallery and\ngets a rooms all of its own.\nOver 1200 works have been\nselected for exhibition. The sheer\nvolume means that the works are\nhung piled on top of each other,\nseveral to one square foot of wall\nspace. From a distance, this gives\nthe gallery space a busy, vibrant\nfeel, almost cosy. It does mean that\nthe smaller works get lost amongst\nthe bigger hangs, and can be easily\nmissed.\nThe hang also reveals the skewed\nrendered in photogravure, a type\nof printmaking. These are hasty\nproductions,fluid,but messy,wholly\nunexceptional. Had they been\nanonymised before being sent in,\nthey would without a doubt never\nhave been exhibited, yet they hang\nin pride of place.The frame is lined\nwith tiny red dots that signify that\nnearly 50 people are willing to\ncough up over a thousand pounds to\nget their hands on an original Emin,\nregardless of quality.\nThat\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t\ncompelling, beautiful work to\nbe found. Norman Ackroyd\u2019s\nseries of monochrome prints are\nas eye-catching as ever, and have\nattracted a series of little red dots\nthemselves. I was a particular fan\nof Olwyn Bowen\u2019s highly textured\nbotanical paintings, as well as the\nminimalistic pencil drawings by the\nlate Ellsworth Kelly. The Singh\nBrothers\u2019 take on the subject of\nthe London riots in the style of\nilluminated medieval manuscripts is\na gorgeous swirl of mustard yellows,\nand scarlet with a sense of humour;\nBoris Johnson comes charging in\nfrom the top corner, broom in hand.\nIf the quality of the paintings\nhas decreased from last year, then\nsculpture has fared better. Sure\nthere\u2019s the weird; a disquietingly\nfluffy tarantula, a grey, very detailed\nsculpture of Iggy Pop.In a conscious\neffort to be edgier, Michael Stokes\nhas created tiny, very explicit,\npornographic, sculptures. They\nare veering on the grotesque, and\ndeeply uncomfortable to look at,\nbut that\u2019s beside the point. What\u2019s\nworse is that they seem to serve no\nhigher purpose than to shock with\nits X-rated content.\nThis summer\u2019s headline event showcases the work of artistic duos\nthe process it took for the creation\nof this sculpture earlier in the year,\nand appreciated the small army of\ncraftspeople it took to bring the\nsculpture to life from a series of\nsketches.\nFor others, it is the placement that\nallows the work to carry weight.\nLaura Ford\u2019s \u2018Silent Howler\u2019 is a\nbronze of a small girl sobbing into\nher hands. She\u2019s placed just at the\nedge of a doorway, head buried\nin her hands, looking impossibly\nforlorn. One could almost mistake\nthe sculpture for a real child who\u2019s\nlost their parents in the bustle of the\ncrowd.\nOne of the most memorable is a\nshipping container stands in the\nmiddle of another room. Look\ncloser, and there are several tiny\nround windows to peer through.\nThe scene inside the container is\none of destruction. A tiny scaled\ndown suspension bridge has\ncollapsed, tiny scaled down cars are\neither falling into the river below, or\nstand abandoned at the side. Tiny,\nscaled down police officers survey\nthe damage. Blue lights flash. This\nglimpse into a Lilliputian land is\noddly transformative.\nFor me, the most impressive was\nanother sculpture. Kutlu\u011f Ataman\u2019s\n\u2018The Portrait of Sak\u0131p Sabanc\u0131\u2019\nhangs over gallery one like an\nenormous blue cloud. It is vaguely\nreptilian, made of ten thousand\nscales of LED monitors that glow\nand flicker to display a mass portrait\nof all the people that the late\nTurkish businessman Sakip Sabanci\nencountered in his life. There are\nfamily members here, friends,\ncolleagues; the whole population\nof his life. It took three years to\nLast year\u2019s coordinator Michael Craig-Martin has his work on display.

    "content": "Introversion\nThe fall and rise of\nAn interview with Mark Morris\nYou started at Imperial in the late nineties,\nstudying Computing. A lot has obviously changed\nsince then. How was your time here and how \u2013\nhaving revisited the department \u2013 have things\nchanged?\nThere was a big change that occurred in the department\nabout five or six years ago, and since then it doesn\u2019t\nseem to have changed much. When I first went to\nImperial for my walk around day (I didn\u2019t have an\ninterview) it was just a sort of \u2018come and have a look\nat the university\u2019, that would have been the Spring of\n1997. At the time I wanted to do a Computer Science\ndegree, but I had this fascination with, or I thought I\nhad a fascination with, AI. In those days there were all\nthese old Sun SPARCstations with these huge monitors\nand really crappy optical mice. I don\u2019t know if you\neven remember mice with balls in them but that was the\nnorm back then. In order for these mice to work you\nhad to have a little mousemat with a grid on it. Hardly\nany of the mice worked, because the grid had faded\noff. And there were these old dot matrix line printers\nyou could use; it was all pre-laser and no Wi-Fi, no\nmobile phones. None of that kind of stuff.\nI was in Weeks hall, and I remember one of the\nreasons why I applied to Weeks hall was because it\nwas one of the few \u2013 it was the only hall actually \u2013\nthat gave you a network connection. On a Computer\nScience degree I knew I was going to be able to want to\nwork from home. I\u2019m not sure broadband was around\nto be honest; I think we were all on dial-up modems.\nWe were really at the back of the birth of the internet.\nIt was kind of an exciting time for Computing and\nthe internet but the department hadn\u2019t really caught\nup with that. So very quickly after leaving I felt quite\nout of touch, despite being a very recent Computer\nScience graduate. We\u2019d done very little HTML, very\nlittle JavaScript. We\u2019d done no PHP.\nThey\u2019re a bit odd, but that\u2019s Imperial\u2019s way. They give\nyou these problems, they give you the high level skills,\nbut none of that instantiation of web development was\ncovered at all. Which was quite different to classical\nimperative programming which I was spending most of\nmy time doing. But I look back fondly on my days at\nImperial, I\u2019m still friends with three of the other guys I\nwent to Imperial with.\nBackthen,wasthereanysortofgamedevelopment\ncommunity?\nNone. There was nothing at all. Chris had written a\nfew games in his spare time. I think he\u2019d written three\nor four before coming to Imperial, and he came to\nImperial with a game called Shadows. I\u2019d never even\nconsidered game development but I\u2019d been a gamer\nup until going to university. There was no community\nat all as far as we were aware. Chris had been telling\nme in a pub of this game idea he had for a hacking\nsim, which ultimately ended up being Uplink. And he\nsaid: \u2018you watch these films like Sneakers and Hackers\nand Lawnmower Man, but no one\u2019s ever really made\na game that simulates that\u2019. I still don\u2019t really have\nthe vision to keep up with Chris. Until I see it, I can\u2019t\nreally deal with it. Even then I didn\u2019t know what he was\ntalking about, I had no idea how he was going to make\nthis thing fun to play, or interesting.\nHe wrote Uplink when Tom and I were out drinking\n\u2013 we were going out most nights and he was staying\nin most nights coding. We\u2019d get back at three in the\nmorning and he\u2019d be up programming. Sure, he\u2019d come\nout occasionally but that was definitely his passion.\nThere was a competition in our final year run by the\nbusiness school for \u00a310,000 for the best business plan.\nAnd Tom, my Electrical Engineering buddy, had taken\nall the corporate programmes. He was a lot more clued\nup on the operation of companies.\nI said to Tom and Chris: \u2018Chris you\u2019ve got a game\nidea and Tom you\u2019ve got the business knowledge,\nshould we just write this business plan\u2019. We never\nintended to run a business. We were going to do our\nbest to win and if we won we\u2019d get ten grand, we\u2019d\nsplit it three ways and pay off a bit of student loan,\nand that would be the end of it. We wrote the business\nplan, but it became very clear to us quite quickly that\nImperial weren\u2019t really interested in supporting that.\nThey were much more interested in new ideas and new\ntechnology that they could exploit.\nThey wanted innovative technology that had broad\nappeal, rather than a videogame. Everytime we went to\nthe meetings they were like: \u2018rather than selling a game\nyou could sell the technology to make games\u2019. We\nstopped bothering going forward with the competition\nbut we had this business plan that said we were going\nto make a few posts on a forum and we were going\nto set up a website to take some credit card orders. It\ntook off relatively quickly, within a few months we were\nable to order 3000 units of Uplink, which we shipped\naround the world. That\u2019s kind of how it began.\nThere was nobody else at Imperial making games,\nand when we started launching the business properly\nand going to trade shows it appeared to us at the time\nthat there was nobody else making games at the scale\nwe were. There were no other small, micro-studios.\nEverybody that was making games, was like EA or\nFrontier \u2013 the big studios. Subsequently it turned out\nthere were a few other developers around and making\nmoney then, but we just didn\u2019t know about them. There\ncertainly wasn\u2019t the community that there is today.\nPerhaps there were more on the West Coast; there\u2019s\nalways been a nice burgeoning community there. The\ninternet was very new so it was difficult to track down\nthese groups of developers. We felt that we were\ntrailblazing to a certain extent.\nSo why do you think Uplink did well? Was it the\ncommunity you created online?\nWith video-games it\u2019s 99% the game and 1% everything\nelse around it. That 1% is important as really good\ngames can get missed but fundamentally the game has\nto be wonderful to be successful. And I think what we\ndid with Uplink was combine our technical knowledge\n\u2013 or Chris\u2019 technical knowledge \u2013 with a very emotive,\ntense and well crafted mystery story. You were as close\nto believing you were a hacker, choosing to support\nor down this big organisation, than any other hacking\ngame that has been made. I think Uplink stands up\ntoday. There\u2019s a few tweaks that could be made but\nfundamentally hacking is exactly the same as it was 15\nyears ago. Now there\u2019s script kiddies but that\u2019s about\nthe only difference. The actual principles of hacking\nare pretty similar. There\u2019s new stuff like jacking into\nWi-Fi that Uplink doesn\u2019t simulate.\nThere\u2019s a lot of technical people in the world that\nlike playing games, intelligent people like everyone at\nImperial, MIT and Oxford and Cambridge, that are a\nlittle underserved by the mainstream media. Everything\n\u2013 and it\u2019s changing a bit now \u2013 tends to be dumbed\ndown to try and broaden the appeal. The problem\nwhen you\u2019re smart and you see dumbing down, is\nthat the suspension of disbelief is broken. Suddenly\nyou go \u2018this is bollocks!\u2019 if you ever watch a hacker\nmovie and see someone like this [Mark clatters on the\nkeyboard] you go \u2018that\u2019s bollocks!\u2019 They\u2019re not really\nthere, they\u2019re not really doing that. The only time I\u2019ve\nseen it filmed well is Mr. Robot. You\u2019re looking at the\ncommands they\u2019re typing and it looks to me as if they\u2019re\ndoing is pretty close to what they\u2019d need to be doing.\nA lot of people played Uplink and the community\ndefinitely helped drive it \u2013 that\u2019s the 1% I\u2019m talking\nabout. The forum and things we set up, that was quite\nnew then. We did a little treasure hunt where you\nactually had to hack our website; we brought Uplink into\nthe real world. The fact that Uplink had this branching\npathway fueled the discussions on the forum. People\nwere having radically different experiences which\nadded to this sense of mystery. X-Files was probably a\nbig touchstone for Uplink \u2013 a mystery where you don\u2019t\nreally know what\u2019s going on. I think those were the\nfactors that caused Uplink\u2019s success. There was nothing\nelse like it. It was a young internet where everyone was\ntech savvy. The audience came together well.\n>>>\nAn Imperial Success Story\nWords by Cale Tilford\n5\n\n"

A key factor in this may\nbe the partnership the college has\nwith Imperial Innovations (see the Dat innovation tho. Photo Credit: Imperial College London\narticle on the previous page) which\nhas helped to foster development of\nideas coming out of Imperial.\nLagging behind Imperial were\nUniversity of Cambridge in 3rd\nand University Oxford in 8th\n, with\nManchester and Dundee coming\ninside the top twenty.The University\nof London, the parent that Imperial\nleft the nest from in 2007 came in\n30th\n,with 17 UK universities making\nthe top 100. This is in comparison\nto 24 German universities, the most\nof any European country, showing\nhow on the innovation forefront,the\nUK is a major player, but not quite\nthe best.\nIt should be known that this\ntakes the innovation of a university\nas a whole and so individual\ndepartments may be better from\none university or another but overall\nImperial stands tall.\nMatt Johnston\nNews Editor On the\ninnovation\nforefront\nthe UK is a\nmajor player\nbut not the\nbest\ncontinued from front page\n...and quintile five, the least\ndisadvantaged.\nThings like references, work\nexperience and quality of personal\nstatements are not taken into\naccount in this data. However,\ngrades and courses are arguably\nthe most reliable when predicting\nwhether a student will get an offer.\nOnly data concerning 18-year-old\nhome applicants was collected and\nit was released as part of an effort by\nUCAS to me more transparent, and\nto help universities look out who\nthey\u2019re letting in and to improve\ntheir practises.\nA spokesperson from Imperial told\nus: \u201cImperial is proud of its highly\ndiverse community and strives to\nensure that its doors are open to\nthe best and brightest students,\nwhatever their background.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a broad portfolio of\nactivities targeted at academically\ntalented pupils. This includes\nworking with schools, colleges and\nImperial application bias revealed in UCAS stats\ncommunity organisations to raise\naspirations, change perceptions,\nsupport teaching staff and stimulate\ninterest in STEM subjects\nfrom primary school through to\nA-Levels.\u201d\n\u201cImperial welcomes the\npublication of this data. We are\nworking to further understand\nwhat factors are at play, and how we\ncan act to improve our admissions\nprocess.\u201d\nAs far as outreach, Imperial has a\ndedicated department for reaching\ndisadvantaged students, running\nsummer schools, lectures and taster\ndays for school children.\nJennie Watson, the union's DPW\ntold FELIX: \"It is inexcusable that\nfewer black applicants are receiving\noffers, however this is nothing new\nand not unique to Imperial.It\u2019s been\nknown for a long time that there are\nunconscious biases in the Higher\nEducation recruitment process.This\ndata represents a wider societal issue\nthough, insofar as the educational\ntrajectory of an individual is set\nlong before they apply to university,\ntherefore this problem cannot be\nsolved only by universities\u2019initiatives\nto widen access to education.\"\nIf it\u2019s the parts of their applications\nthat aren\u2019t from predicted grades that\nare letting disadvantaged students\ndown, college may need to change\nits enrolment process to account for\nschools not giving their students\nthe best advice on applying, in order\nto really level the playing field.\nOtherwise, college will continue\nto inadvertently not offer places to\nthe best students, discounting the\nbenefits of their background.\nLast year, David Cameron\nannounced that UCAS applications\nwere going name-blind from 2017\nin an attempt to remove some\nunconscious bias on the part of\nuniversities. UCAS says ethnic\nminority applicants are up since\n2006, but that it is keen to increase\n\u201cparticipation from disadvantaged\ngroups\u201d.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nWe literally couldn't find any pictures of black people graduating in Imperial's\npromotional picture database.

However, Bristol, Oxford,\nCambridge, and Imperial were\nsome of the few who had large gaps\nbetween the offer rate applicants\u2019\ngrades and subjects would predict,\nand the actual offer rate for students\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds.\nLastyearatImperial,thosecoming\nfrom the most disadvantaged\nbackgrounds were 4.2% less likely to\nget an offer than you\u2019d expect from\ntheir grades and subjects. Our stats\nare slightly worse than Cambridge\u2019s,\nwhere students from the most\ndisadvantaged groups are only 3.7%\nless likely to get a place.\nOn the other side, at Imperial,\napplicants from the most\nadvantaged group were 2.3 points\nmore likely to be awarded an offer,\nand when you look at the random\nvariability considering the number\nof applicants and the average offer,\nthis is unlikely to have happened\nby chance. Again, Imperial is even\nmore likely than Cambridge to\ngive offers to the most privileged\napplicants.\nUCAS used something called\nthe POLAR3 classification to\ndefine students\u2019 socioeconomic\nbackground.

    "content": "Beyond Prison Architect\nWhere did the name Introversion come\nfrom?\nWe\u2019d just learnt at university about Myers\u2013Briggs\u2019\npersonality test. It\u2019s basically a model to codify\ndifferent personality types into one of 16 categories.\nBoth Chris and I were intrigued that this was possible.\nBoth of us, when we learnt about the personality test,\nhad resonated quite a lot with the categories we ended\nup in.\nWhen Chris wrote the opening sequence for Uplink\nit flashed through all of the Myers\u2013Briggs indicators,\nending on introversion. We named the company when\nwe wrote the business plan, and when we asked Chris\nwhat to call it he suggested Introversion Software.\nWe thought it sounded pretty cool. Nowadays, we\u2019d\nprobably have to call ourselves something like \u201cBing\nBang\u201d or some fucking nonsense word, or put a monkey\nin it. Game Gibbon?\nWith the financial success of Prison\nArchitect, what\u2019s next for Introversion?\nAre you looking to expand?\nNo, we\u2019re not going to expand. We like our size. Well,\nwe\u2019ll expand slowly at our own rate. We take interns\nfrom Imperial and we\u2019ve had about three now. I\u2019m\ntrying to make that process, which in the past has been\na bit ad hoc, more formal.\nThis was the first year that we had advertised for an\nintern and we selected one recently who\u2019s going to\ncome and work for us. If our interns are very strong,\nand they want to work for us, there will probably\nbe a place. That\u2019s how we will expand, rather than\naggressively thinking we need to hire loads of coders.\nEach game project has its own unique requirements.\nBecause of the indie revolution, the ecosystem now is\nmuch richer than it once was. The guy who did all the\nart for Prison Architect, a very talented man called\nRyan Sumo, had been the artist on Spacechem. Chris\nknew roughly what sort of talent he wanted for Prison\nArchitect. Now Ryan lives in the Philippines but after\na few emails and contracts, suddenly we had a world\nclass artist working with us. Now that the game has\ncome to an end, Ryan\u2019s doing his next thing. That\u2019s\nimportant because the next game from Introversion\ndoesn\u2019t require a 2D top-down art style.\nShort-term for Introversion we have Prison Architect\ncoming out on Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PS4. We\u2019re\nnot doing that work yourself. I like to describe the team\nporting a game as like a car tuning company; they\ntake a really well crafted core game experience on\nPC and turn it into an outstanding console experience.\nThey rework every interface, the control mechanisms,\nfix annoying bugs, and add in support to make the\nprogression a little more gentle for the console\naudience. They don\u2019t dumb the game down; that\u2019s\nwrong. They make the ramp into the game less steep\nthan it is for the PC audience.\nWe\u2019ve got some other platforms in development\nbut we want to move away from Prison Architect this\nyear. Internally, we\u2019re working on some new ideas that\nwe\u2019re going to be showing at Rezzed. With these new\nprototypes we want to do a market test and see which\nprototype players resonate with the most. We can then\nuse that information to feed into what we\u2019re doing for\nthe rest of the year.\nPrison Architect is a simulator. What do\nyou think makes a good simulator? How\ndo you balance the complexity with a\ngame actually simple and fun to play?\nBalance is the key word. There are a lot of factors\nthat you have to get right. The player has to be able\nto understand action and consequence. That was\nsomething we always worked really hard on with\nPrison Architect.\nWe could simulate everything but the player has to\nknow why that prisoner just died. If it\u2019s too covert then\nthere\u2019s no fun in that situation. There might be a degree\nof fun in trying to figure it out but you have to get the\nbalance right.\nA really good example of this is the contraband\nscreen. When you find contraband it backtracks through\nthe contraband flow into your prison. There\u2019s a deadly\nfight and you have a dead prisoner on your hands.\nNow you need to know that one of the prisoners used a\nscrewdriver to kill the guy and you need to understand\nwhere that screwdriver came from. Then you need to\nknow what you can do to prevent that from happening\nin the future.\nIf you make that process too easy, then people are\nnot interested in playing because there\u2019s no challenge\nto it. If you make it too hard, you\u2019ll lose players quickly\nbecause they won\u2019t understand why all this shit\u2019s going\non. So a lot of the work we did was about trying to\nmanage that.\nWhat worked well was the alpha process, being\nable to drop in new systems on a monthly basis and\nto see whether that system worked or not. Rather than\ndropping the entire complexity bomb out there at once,\nwhich would have been a QA nightmare, we were able\niteratively add new systems like contraband distribution\nvia the laundry system.\nWe\u2019d then look to see if we had broken the game. If\nnot we could then move forward and layer something\nelse in. There were some features we\u2019d add in that\nwould ruin the game, and then we would backtrack.\n>>>\nYou released Prison Architect in \u201cearly\naccess\u201d on Steam. The process you have\ndescribed is what many in software\ndevelopment would call agile. Do you\nthink you\u2019d develop a game in that way\nagain?\nI think that it applies to some games more than others.\nThat development methodology particularly worked\nfor Prison Architect but it also had a massive impact\non our ability to market the game. Chris and I made\nmonthly update videos, and we\u2019ve built an audience\nnow that expect a monthly update from us. And we\u2019ll\nattempt to continue with that.\nAs we move onto different projects we\u2019ll see a drop\noff but we don\u2019t know yet how big that will be. We\nhope that Chris and I will be able to transition Prison\nArchitect fans into core Introversion fans \u2013 fans that\nwant to understand about game development and\nenjoy the banter between Chris and I in the videos. We\nwant to give people an insight into what we\u2019re doing\nbut always backed up with something that they can\nplay now. It\u2019s an exciting time.\nPrison Architect.\nDarwinia.\nWe want to give people\nan insight into what we\u2019re\ndoing but always backed\nup with something that\nthey can play now\n9\n8\n\n"

    "content": "V\nideogames tell stories \u2013 not just\nthrough their images, text and sound,\nbut also through their interactivity.\nThe first commercially successful\nvideogame that began defining the medium\nwas Pong in 1972. In the 40 years since we\nhave created an industry that handles more\nmoney than the entirety of the music and film\nindustry combined, and tells tales that are\nequally compelling. How did we get here?\nHow did storytelling develop from fake ping\npong paddles to crying over Aerith\u2019s death in\nFinal Fantasy VII and beyond?\nIn the early days, games were all about\nmechanics: game creators did not bother with\nimmersive plotlines. Hardware could barely\nrun anything, constraining game design. And\nmost arcade games were seen as technological\nfeats of their time, with the ability to play with\na machine enough of a novelty on its own.\nMuch like the early days of cinema, the first\ntrue games displayed their mechanics through\na shallow plot that could barely be regarded\nas a story, much less part of a bigger \u2018lore\u2019.\nThe aim of Space Invaders was not to make\nyou feel like the last line of defense against an\nalien invasion, and when Jumpman (Mario\u00b4s\noriginal name) came out, all of its narrative\nwas laid out in the accompanying manual,\nwith very little development to the story itself\nplaying out on-screen \u2013 not an uncommon\npractice at the time.\nBy the mid 80s, a change to the way\nexperiences were delivered had emerged.\nThe Legend of Zelda was released in 1986,\nintroducing a save system. This opened the\nfourth dimension to game design, as each\ngame session did not have to start from the\nbeginning of the game, and was subsequently\nadopted by the vast majority of game genres\nwith a few exceptions. The state of the game\ncould be stored, stopped, and resumed. Open\nworlds became possible, and the concept of\nplaying through a story was born. Instead\nof revealing a game through mechanics, the\ninteraction of these mechanics with the world\n\u2013 the stages and levels \u2013 became the focus\nof attention, plot development, and game\nexposition. This also meant that a larger set\nof game features could be expanded upon:\nLink could not only slash his sword, he could\nspin, shoot arrows, plant bombs, and acquire\nnew items, creating a sense of achievement\nand progression that previous games were\nseverely lacking.\nAs time progressed, tales began to be told\noutside of the playable mechanics. Mirroring\nthe success of the film industry, a whole branch\nof games were born. The Secret of Monkey\nIsland (1990) gave a critically acclaimed start\nto graphic adventures. And even today, titles\nlike Heavy Rain (2010) or Until Dawn (2015)\nkeep refining the interactive movie scene,\nallowing you to step into your favourite generic\nAmerican teenage horror movie. A personal\nfavourite is the innovative \u2018environmental\nnarrative\u2019: this emphasises storytelling\nthrough map layout, enemy location, item\ndrops, music, and much more. FromSoftware,\ncreators of the Dark Souls franchise, do a\nwonderful job of it. For example, the player\ncan deduce a connection between a boss, and\ntwo previous bosses in the first Dark Souls title\nthrough the incorporation of musical motifs of\nthe characters from the original game in the\ntheme of the new boss.\nThe games that started the industry, those\ninterested in engaging mechanics with\nlittle focus on a storyline, also evolved and\nimproved over time. From Tron (1982),\nSuper Mario Bros (1985), all the way to the\nmodern age with titles such as Skate (2007)\nor Mirror\u2019s Edge (2008). While you might not\nthink the latter two fall into this category, try\nto imagine Tony Hawk\u2019s without any skating\nmechanics, or Portal without, well, portals.\nBeautiful things happen when this method\nmeets storytelling. The Hotline Miami saga\n(2012-2015) makes its mechanics, and how\nthe player feels about them, a major piece of\nits storytelling. And Undertale owes part of its\nmight to how every battle is tailored to each\nenemy, with personalised combat mechanics\nfor each encounter. These tell you more about\nthe world you\u2019re playing in, and what you\u2019re\nfighting for and against.\nIn the end, videogames differentiate\nthemselves from other mediums because they\nallow players to play a story, to be part of\nit, to shape it to their own liking. Literature,\nfilm, performing, painting, cannot deliver\nthis. Of course, this is not an easy task. Even\nwhen a game\u2019s story is well written and its\nmechanics are compelling, there may not\nnecessarily be coherence between the two.\nThis is known as ludonarrative dissonance:\nthe conflict between a game\u2019s narrative and\nits gameplay. Take for instance the newly\nBy the mid\n80s a change\nto the way\nexperiences\nwere\ndelivered\nhad emerged\nThe History of\nStorytelling in\nVideogames\nWords by Dani Hernandez Perez\nreleased Uncharted 4: its story pivots around\nthe idea that Nathan, the main protagonist,\nwants to leave his adventurous live behind,\nand thus ending all the maddening slaughter\nthat has been the focus of the whole saga.\nYet somehow the game manages to make you\ngo through endless stages of cover based\nshooting, entirely defeating the point that\nthe game is trying to make. In fact, if you\nstick around enough to kill a 1000 enemies,\nyou will be rewarded with a trophy named\n\u2018Ludonarrative dissonance\u2019.\nSpace Invaders. Taito\nThe Secret of Monkey Island. LucasArts\nEven when\na game\u2019s\nstory is well\nwritten and\nits mechanics\nare\ncompelling,\nthere\nmay not\nnecessarily\nbe\ncoherence\nbetween the\ntwo\nThe Legend of Zelda. Nintendo\n19\n\n"

    "content": "W\nhen I was 13, for Christmas I\nasked for Valve\u2019s The Orange\nBox, a collection of games\nwhich are now commonplace\nin most gamers\u2019 Steam libraries: Team Fortress\n2, Portal, and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 Half-Life\n2. While my brother and sister played with\ntheir new festive gifts, I went straight to the\nfamily computer, put in the disk, and left it to\ndownload during Christmas lunch. And the\ntypical Christmas evening television began, I\nbegan my journey into the dystopian world of\nGordon Freeman.\nHalf-Life 2 is, unsurprisingly, the successor to\nthe 1998 game Half-Life, which saw Gordon\nFreeman, the employee of the 1970s-era\nResearch Facility known as Black Mesa, take\npart in an experiment which went horribly\nwrong. As far as it goes, opening a hole in\nthe fabric of space, allowing hostile beings to\ncharge through and attack the facility, was\nprobably the worst outcome imaginable. Dr\nFreeman charges his way through the facility,\ndefending himself against threats, terrestrial\nand otherwise, until a mysterious figure offers\nhim an even more mysterious job. Cut to\ndarkness, and Half-Life ends.\nHalf-Life 2 begins in the same way its\npredecessor begins: on a train. However,\nover the next few minutes Valve sets a scene\nslightly more ominous than your average\nSouth Kensington tube station. The train stops\nat a drab, worn down platform, guarded and\ncontrolled by mask-wearing police officers,\nand you soon see several of these officers\nattacking a civilian in an alleyway \u2013 the final\nevidence of the dire situation you\u2019re in. It\nemerges you\u2019ve found yourself several years\nafter the original Half-Life, where an invading\nforce known as the Combine has taken over\nthe planet.\nIt feels unnerving to start in such a hostile\nenvironment with no weapons, but soon you\nare equipped with many, including an ordinary\ncrowbar, shotgun, a rocket launcher, and a\nzero-point energy field manipulator (fondly\nnicknamed the gravity gun) . With these tools,\nyou shall carve a rebellion into the face of this\ndystopian world, one click at a time.\nThe physics engine is one of a kind. There\nare many puzzle-like parts earlier on in the\ngame which highlight this, and unlike current\ngames which possess physics gameplay\nthat mainly facilitates fantastic and chaotic\ndestruction, the physics engine from Half-Life\n2 is shown off as a means to solving problems\nthroughout the game. There is a part in the\nsewers below City 17 where a beam lies\nacross a big lump of concrete like a seesaw;\nlike a caveman learning how to use tools, the\nplayer slowly works out that the breezeblocks\nin the surrounding area can be used to weigh\ndown one side of the beam, to allow access to\na pipe higher up in the room. The capability\nof this engine led to the infamous sandbox\ngame Garry\u2019s Mod, which uses the physics\nand assets from Half-Life 2.\nOn the other hand, sometimes the physics\nmade the combat feel slightly awkward.\nWhen you encounter an enemy they show no\nvisible reaction or distress when attacked, and\nwhen their health is completely drained they\nimmediately become a ragdoll at the drop of\na hat. Bungie\u2019s Halo 2 was released seven\ndays prior to Half-Life 2, and another Valve\ngame, Counter-Strike: Source was released\neight days prior to this. In Halo, you can blaze\nyour way through an army of invading hostile\naliens, wielding nothing but a battle rifle on\na militarized quad-bike, whereas in CounterStrike you and your team must carefully\nprevent bombings and hostage situations\nusing modern weaponry. Both franchises,\nalthough focusing on totally different styles\nof combat, are renowned for their excellent\nshooting mechanics. In comparison, Half-Life\u2019s\nstrengths lie in the plot and other aspects of\ngameplay.\nI returned to Half-Life 2 during the long\nsummer before my first year at Imperial\nstarted. There are some great achievements\nin the game, specifically one which I pursued\nin the final episode: Little Rocket Man, which\nasks the player to carry a garden gnome for\nover half of the game, and send it off into\nspace. Simple, right? Not so simple when you\nhave to drive a beaten down truck across the\nbaron wasteland, with nothing to hold your\nnew ceramic friend in place but a ridiculously\nunstable passenger seat. It took me three days\nto get that achievement, but it was fantastically\nrewarding. The second episode ends with\nGordon Freeman and his partner in crime,\nAlyx Vance, about to head off to a research\nfacility (or more accurately, accidentally\nteleported freighter) in a frozen wasteland.\nThe epic tale concludes with Alyx\u2019s father,\nEli, being attacked and mortally wounded by\none of the alien overlords, his fate unknown.\nWith this inconclusive ending, people craved\na third episode which could sate their desire\nto put crowbar to hand, and apply crowbar\nto enemy. However, Valve moved onto Left\n4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and many other brilliant\ngames. While fans have found hints of HalfLife 3 in Dota 2 code, and suggestions of a\nvirtual reality game, Valve have remained\nsilent about anything involving a possible\nthird episode.\nPersonally, I hope that there is no Half-life 3.\nOf course, based on Valve\u2019s track record, the\ngameplay would be fantastic and innovative,\nbut that is not the point. Half-Life 2 is a classic,\none of the first games I played, so naturally\nthere\u2019s a sense of nostalgia which I don\u2019t\nthink a reboot could live up to. Reboots in\nany media format can be remarkable; Star\nWars: The Force Awakens made one billion\ndollars in the first twelve days of release, the\nfastest movie to ever reach that that feat. This\nwas achieved because of an army of writers,\nactors, fans and supporting crew understood\nwhat Star Wars is all about. The problem with\nreturning to \u2018old\u2019 franchises is that companies\nchange and the people working for them do\nto. Marc Laidlaw, the main writer of Half-Life\n2 and its expansions, no longer works for\nValve; since the plot and writing were core\nto Half-Life 2\u2019s critical success, the absence of\nLaidlaw could put a sequel (or reboot) on thin\nice. Of course, much like The Force Awakens,\nanother instalment of Gordon Freeman could\nbe a masterpiece, but only time (and Valve)\nwill tell.\nHalf-Life 2 Revisited\nWords by Harry Mitchell\nThe tale of a scientist and his crowbar\nThrough a computer\nscreen darkly\nInterpreting The Sims\nWords by Fred Fyles\nImages by Indira Mallik\nT\nhe fire started in the kitchen. First\nshooting up from the cooker, it\nsoon spread across the wooden\ncountertops and engulfed the\nrefrigerator, which began to darken and burn.\nThere wasn\u2019t much furniture in the house \u2013 the\nfamily had only just moved in after all \u2013 but\nthere was enough. Bella, who was home at\nthe time, saw the wisps of smoke and went\nrunning into the kitchen; upon seeing the\nflames she panicked, and, rooted to the spot,\nshe could do nothing as the fire consumed\nher. The children came home from school to\nfind the kitchen reduced to a pile of dust; their\nmother\u2019s ashes contained in a gleaming metal\nurn.\nThis is my clearest recollection of The Sims\nby far. The fires may have just been a pattern\nof pixels \u2013 looking at screenshots now, they\nretain a subtle menace; their artificiality,\ntheir ludicrous orange hue, only heighten\nthe intuition that they should be feared \u2013\nbut to 7-year-old me they seemed very real.\nI immediately exited the game, threw down\nmy headphones, and did not approach it for\nat least a week. But I did return. I returned\nto The Sims, and to its numerous expansion\npacks; I returned to The Sims 2, released a\nfew years later, and have vivid memories of\ngoing to a friend\u2019s for Easter lunch, only to\nspend the whole time playing it upstairs; and\nI returned to The Sims 3, which is still installed\non my parents\u2019 computer back home.\nWhat I am trying to say, really, is that for\nmy entire gaming life, The Sims has formed\nan indelible backdrop. It was the first game I\nreally played seriously, and even today, when\nI go back home for the holidays I may find\nmyself tempted to load it up, slipping back\ninto the comforting reminders of childhood.\nBetween then and now there have been\ncountless hours spent on the Xbox, a fleeting\nfraternisation with Nintendo, and an even\nbriefer month or two of MMORPGs, but The\nSims occupies a special place in my heart.\nOriginally this essay was meant to involve me\nrevisiting my favourite childhood game, but\nas I read up on the origins of The Sims, and\nmore of my early memories were unearthed,\nI began to realise just how complex the game\nactually is. In trying to replicate our own\nexistence, the creators of The Sims actually\ncreated a great work of art; and like any\ngreat work of art, The Sims cries out to be\nanalysed, deconstructed, and critiqued.\nBut why interrogate a game, something that\n>>>\n13\n\n"

Titicut\nFollies is the first film from\ndirector Frederick Wiseman, a\ngiant in the documentary world,\nwho stormed into the Bridgewater\nState Hospital for the criminally\ninsane in 1966, armed only with a\ncamera and a whole lot of chutzpah.\nOver the course of 84 minutes,\nWiseman exposes the goings on in\nthe hospital, from the mundane to\nthe horrific: we see prisoners being\nforce-fed, stripped, and relentlessly\ntaunted by the guards, who are\non the whole indifferent to their\ncharges\u2019 well-being.\nIn one horrific scene, we follow\na man back from a shave, who is\nmercilessly mocked by the guards,\nuntil he begins to scream at them\nin a rage; once back to his cell, he\nenters into some kind of trance, and\npaces around the room, stamping\ndown his heels. Cameraman John\nMarshall, previously known for his\nethnographic work, takes all this in\nimpassively and relentlessly.The film\ntakes its name from the in-hospital\ntalent show, scenes from which\nbookend the film, and are the stuff\nof Lynchian nightmare. As the lines\nbetween inmate and guard blur, it\nbecomes more and more difficult to\ndistinguish between individuals, the\nwhole scene spinning out of control\nlike some kind of vision of hell.\nWhat is astonishing about Titicut\nFollies is that it set a pattern for\nWiseman that he has not yet\ndeviated from. Over a career\nspanning five decades, he has stuck\nto his signature style: lengthy shots,\nno voice-over, no interviews, and no\nexplanation. While his films may\nhave gotten longer, he has doggedly\nremained faithful to these principles,\nresulting in over 40 arresting works,\na large number of which focus on\nsingle institutions: 1995\u2019s Ballet,\nwhich looked at the American\nBallet Theatre; 1987\u2019s Missile, which\ninvestigated the training courses\nfor ICBM operators; and 1975\u2019s\nWelfare, which took place in a single\nwelfare office.\nThrough his work, Wiseman\nreveals himself as one of the world\u2019s\nbest editors. Eschewing any notion\nof objectivity in cinema, Wiseman\nadmits that all film will be biased:\n\u2018the editing,\u2019 he says, \u2018is highly\nmanipulative\u2019.Often ending up with\nat least a hundred hours of footage,\nhe will go through it,picking out the\nbest sections, and cutting it down to\na taut narrative (that usually runs\nover several hours).\nIn Titicut Follies, Wiseman forces\nus to ask the question of what\nthe ethical limits of documentary\nfilmmaking are. He holds the\ncamera still for as long as he\npossibly can, and then even further,\nbreaking down the lines between\nobservation and voyeurism. The\nethics is complicated by the fact\nthat he only received consent forms\nfrom the guards, and not from the\nprisoners, many of whom were not\ncompetent.\nJust before its release in 1967, the\ngovernment attempted to ban the\nfilm, and in 1968 they succeeded,\nmaking it the first film to be banned\nfor reasons other than obscenity\nand national security. In 1987\ninmates\u2019 families sued the prison\nafter a number of fatalities, and\nthe prosecution team argued that\nreleasing Titicut Follies in 1967\nwould have led to reform.\nIn many ways, Wiseman reminds\nme of Diane Arbus, whose\nphotographs forced the viewer\nto look at something they would\nnormally shy away from. \u2018A lot of\npeople,\u2019 Arbus wrote, \u2018they want to\nbe paid that much attention. And\nthat\u2019s a reasonable kind of attention\nto be paid.\u2019\nOriginally trained as a lawyer,\nWiseman\u2019s films stand up for their\nsubjects, providing individuals with\nthe means to represent themselves;\nin Titicut Follies he attempts to shine\na light in one of society\u2019s darkest\ncorners, leaving us all enriched.\nTiticut Follies takes an unflinching look at mental health in America.

    "content": "PAGE 40 PAGE 41\nFRIDAY 17th\nJUNE 2016 felixonline.co.uk felixonline.co.uk FRIDAY 17th\nJUNE 2016\nTHE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nThe Editors\u2019 picks of the past year...\nFrank Auerbach\nAbsent\nSite responsive performance is certainly something of an artistic niche. While I had occasionally come across the genre\nbefore, I had never really given the field a full and fair consideration nor was I particularly aware of any particular artist\npracticing it. Dreamthinkspeak\u2019s Absent changed that for me. Probably best described as a walk-through experience like\none might find at the London dungeon (but with none of the cheap fake blood or lack of merit), the time and effort\ndevoted to site responsive work based in the Shoreditch Town Hall must have been truly staggering. A\nreal revelation in what is artistically possible, Absent might not have been the best example of this\nsurprising art form, but its individuality and its skill in totally enveloping the viewer left me feeling\nboth genuinely enlightened and impressed which, given my usual cynicism, makes it my standout show of the past year. MF\nThis sharp and biting retrospective from one of this country\u2019s most revered and wonderful artists wowed from October to\nMarch at the often underappreciated Tate Britain. With work spanning from Auerbach\u2019s early self-portraits to the landscapes\nfrom his Mornington Crescent studio, the vivid use of colour and strong textured canvasses strike home as truly unique in\ntoday\u2019s cluttered world of contemporary art. In the same class as the revered Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon,\nAuerbach truly is one of today\u2019s great living artists and this exhibition powerfully and convincingly justifies\nhis legendary status. MF\nPainting the Modern Garden\nFirmly in the Impressionism wheelhouse it may have been,and staid and comfortable compared to some of the modern art\nexhibitions on show this year, but no less joyfully exuberant for being so. It featured the greatest hits from Matisse, John\nSinger Sargent, Van Gogh, and more, and exhibited the greatest collection of Monets I have had the pleasure of seeing. It\nbrought the sunshine of French and Spanish gardens to a gloomy February.It was the perfect exhibition save for the actual\nexperience of going to see it; I missed the press view and went on another day with seemingly all of London, and their\nuncle.Even on a Tuesday afternoon,big name exhibitions can inspire the sort of crush that Oxford Street dreams\nof. All of which is to remind of two important lessons: a) never pass up an exhibition of Monets, no matter\nhow many times you\u2019ve seen a reproduction, seeing the paintings up close can be an experience, and b)\nif you want to go see a big-time exhibition, seriously, go to the press preview with your free ticket\ncourtesy of FELIX Arts, no need to slum it with the hoi polloi, ain\u2019t nobody got time for that. IM\nElectronic Superhighway\nThis exhibition brought together 50 years of artists exploring the internet. It wove together sculpture, video, more painterly\ntechniques, featuring everything from Pac-Man to internet spam karaoke. Showing the work of artists produced at the the\nbirth of the internet to artists working now, it displayed our love affair with the world wide web, exploring its evolution from the\nromanticism of a hyperconnected world, to the Orwellian near-dystopia of constant surveillance, dipping into the evolution of\nvideo games, and the intricacies of internet chat rooms along the way. Like the internet itself, it was by turns\ncompelling, confusing, fun, and ever so slightly creepy all rolled into one; an exhibition worthy of one of\nthe greatest inventions of the modern age. IM\nThe year\u2019s worst... Consensual\nIt is rare that any show can anger me so much that the thought of it still makes me queasy the next morning. But, as\nI write this article, it is only the National Youth Theatre\u2019s production of Consensual which has consistently infuriated\nand upset me on an almost weekly basis since I saw it all the way back in October. Had it been a fully professional\nproduction by a (poorly) paid cast, the anger and disappointment would have been enough already. However, as the\nflagship production to show off the best from the National Youth Theatre,this production both embarrasses this institution\nto which I had proudly called myself a member, and completely scandalises the interest and intellect of today\u2019s young\npeople. Displaying London\u2019s youth as selfish, stupid and sex-crazed, many other publications lauded what they called a\npowerful and \u201cprovocative\u201d production. However, not wanting to step on their toes, I can happily say that this must have\nbeen the singly worst show I have ever seen. MF\nThe Serpentine Pavilion\nThe Serpentine Gallery\u2019s Pavilion, a mere stone\u2019s throw from the South Ken campus, is perhaps one the best places to amp up\nthe culture factor on a sunny summer\u2019s day. It\u2019s free, it\u2019s outside (bang in the middle of Hyde Park), and it houses a caf. The\nPavilion project was created to showcase the best in architecture and design, last year, was a kaleidoscope of bright colours, like\nstepping into a futuristic deconstructed stained glass window. This year, it\u2019s gone monochrome; the Bjarke Ingels Group has\ncreated an \u2018unzipped wall\u2019.What seems like a straight tower flares out in a spiralling three dimensional space; a pyramid that\u2019s\nbeen put through spin cycle.It\u2019s built from stacked fibreglass bricks creating a structure that is surprisingly fluid and beautifully\nundulating. It\u2019s functional too; the Park Nights programme is housed there which will showcase a line up of musicians, writers\nand performance artists. IM\nMary Heilmann\nMary Heilmann is that rare breed; a female abstract artist. Now in her seventies, she\u2019s recently begun to find the\nbig-time art world fame that eluded her for most of her career. In this retrospective at the Whitechapel Gallery,\nher first full exhibition in the UK since 2001, Heilmann brings to London the colour, and effortless cool of the\nAmerican West Coast. Her work, ranging from paintings, furniture, and ceramics is based on grids,\narchitectural shapes filled with riotous, sunny colour. Each piece is autobiographical in some way,\nreferencing everything and anything from her grandmother\u2019s house in 1940s San Francisco,\nto surfing, doing acid trips, The Sex Pistols, and the mid century New Yorks arts scene. IM\nShakespeare 400 Events\nThis marks the 400th\nanniversary since Shakespeare\u2019s death, in celebration of his work, events have been going on throughout\n2016. You may already have seen A Midsummer\u2019s Night Dream as staged by Doctor Who\u2019s Russell T Davies, or the Hollow\nCrown, as starring the culturally omnipresent Benedict Cumberbatch on TV. Unsurprisingly, the Globe Theatre is leading\nthe vanguard for events in London. A Midsummer\u2019s Night Dream, Macbeth, and the Taming of the Shrew are all being staged\nin the summer. Additionally, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe will be running a series of lectures, workshops , and\nother educational events exploring the work of Shakespeare in greater detail. There\u2019s a great breadth of\noptions, so if their website is well worth visiting. IM \t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn The Heights\nMusicals may not be high art (in the case of Hamilton, this editor would vehemently disagree) but they are fun, and it\nwould be hard to more fun than this. In the Heights is Lin Manuel Miranda\u2019s (he of Hamilton fame) lesser known musical,\nessentially based around a love story set in the Washington Height\u2019s, a rough area of New York, it\u2019s a colourful,\nits music an eclectic mix of salsa, soul, hip-hop and R&B. Its feel-good, punchy grooves earned it three\nOlivier awards earlier this year, and a Tony award for Best Score during its Broadway run. As well as\nbeing a great night out in and of itself, it\u2019s the perfect preparation for Hamilton\u2019s arrival to the West\nEnd in October next year.

Having started on the original\nconversion with the renowned architects Herzog & de Meuron in 1995, this latest extension by the same architects has created\n(what I hope to be) a wonderful new space to house the vast unseen collections of the Tate.With more works in their vaults than\ncould possibly fill their walls,this new extension gives the public a real chance to appreciate a breadth and quality of art otherwise\nonly seen by the priviledged few.While the extension\u2019s success is still to be seen, the devotion of more space to the arts can surely\nbe nothing but a good thing.
