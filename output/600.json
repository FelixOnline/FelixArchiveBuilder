Not content with his\nnefarious activities last year, his\nat tro cio us work on the ICU Handbook and the deprave dRag Mag, he has sought to \"go\nout with a bang\" to use his own\nwords.\nIs it not true that he now goes\naround London reciting a selection of extremely indecent\npoems about Captain Lindley,\nthe Least disgusting of which begins:\n\" I laughed on the day that the\nCaptain,\nWas jabbed up the arse with a hat pin....\" It is clear from your conduct,\nsir, that far from seeking to\ndiscourage him from these\nactivities, you have given him\nhelp and active support.\nYou both ought to be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves.\nYours truly\nMike Thomas\nSir\nIt will be a dangerous precedent for IC to encourage 'positive\ndiscrimination'. In doing so IC\nlays itself open to legal action\nunder the Race Relations Act,\nand the publicity given to such a court case will do nothing to\nenhance the reputation of the\nCollege.\nWith this issue and the prop-o sed merger with QE C one\nwonders if Lord Flowers is\nconcerned about preserving the\nhigh academic standards and reputation of IC. Yours\nP. Simion\nMaths1 Dear Sir\nI would like to take this\nopportunity to congratulate you\non your recent feat of media\nmanipulation. I refer, of course,\nto your treatment of the Rag Mag saga.\nFELIX entered the arena with a far cia1 letters page wherein the Editor took it upon\nhimself to be ridiculously pedantic and after exalting people to.\ncontribute, treated serious letters\nwith abandon in a manner fully\nintended to insult. FELIX was\nalso partially responsible for\ncreating the myth of a huge\nChaplaincy block vote, decrying\ntheir audacity to voice an opinion. It was said that those\nwho voted against the Rag Mag were responsible lor the loss ol\nrevenue and that they were the\nsort of people who never did\nanything to help the Charities. It\nshould be clearly pointed out\nthat the responsibility for a loss of\nrevenue would lie with those\nresponsible for producing the\nRag Mag. Finally, I find myself asking\nthree questions:\n1) Are we going to see a repeat of\nlast year's dire editorial ranting s with the Chaplaincy replacing\nDave Alblabi as the pel hate?\n2) Are Editors so incapable of\npresenting lucid arguments that\nthey must Find some aspect ol\ntheir opponent's nature on which\nto base a slur campaign?\n3) Does the Editor really feel that\nhe should base his style on that of\nGoebbels?\nI ours\nDonal Donat Conor Brad lev\nFroliche Weinachlen!- Ed\nSuit makes me feel sick that the\npeople who voted to re circulate the Rag Mag claimed that they\nwere doing it in the name of\ncharity. Iam quite certain that\nnone of those hypocrites care at\nall about the deaf children, as\nthey evidently don't care for\nanyone suffering from any other\nkind of handicap.\nAt the end of the previous\nU GM,a collection was taken to\nrecoup loss caused by the banning of the magazine. As it is\nnow back in circulation, I would\nlike my money back, as I intend\nto give it to some other charity-one which raises money by less\ndubious means\nThere are many things that the\nhandicapped need more than\nmoney, such as sympathy and\nunderstanding, which the Rag Mag is trying to destroy. No amount of money can ever compensate people for the loss of\nthat.\nIf anyone wants to know about\ncharities which need actual help,\nplease contact me, especially if\nyou will be here over Xmas week.\n} ours\nFiona Sinclair\nAero PG Sir\nOn Monday lunchtime a large\ngroup of st alf and students from\nthe Life Sciences Division turned\nup to a hastily arranged meeting\nlo hear the Rector speak about\nthe proposed merger of QF2C\nBiological Sciences Dept and that\nof IC.O EC has about 500 biology\nstudents. IC has only 200, with a further250 Biochemists. This merger is thus not a swamping by\nIC. The merger was a popular\noption amon st QE C staff when\nthey were offered several ideas for\nensuring the college's survival in\na recent ballot.\nThis act of \" charity\" on the\npart of the Rector is not seen as\nsuch by Life Scientists. There has\nbeen no consultation with students or st a IT until this meeting and we were given only\n2 dav s to say if we agreed in\nprinciple with the idea (though\nwhat would happen if we didn't he would, not say). With only 10\ndays to the end of term, it would\nbe difficult to change the draft\nproposals.\nSeveral questioners asked whether Life Sciences would have any say in its own future.\nThe Rector would only reply\n\"Since when have we done things\nby formal ballot?\"\nSo it seems that Life Sciences is\nindeed to be sacrificed in order to\nplacate the U GG when we have\nbeen asked to increase our numbers (a move which the dept\ntook as meaning as tre ngh ten ing of the new and vital aspects of\nbiology at IC).\nThe Rector mentioned an increase in income \" Up to \u00a34.5\nmillion\" QE C's current budget.\nHowever, as the biological sciences is only half of the\ncollege's activities and the\nremaining \u00a31 million would betaken care of by \"the cuts\" it is\ndifficult to find justification lor\nthis statement.\nWill Life Sciences be allowed a voice in its own future?\n} ours\nV Mark Exley\nBiochem 3\nP.S. Why was Nick Morton absent from such an important\nmeeting, especially as he has\nnearly lined up post doc work for\nhimself for after his sabbatical?\nDear Editor\nI feel I must clarify one or two\npoints that appear in your article\n'Getting together with Q.E. C.' of\n2 0 th November. Firstly the\nfactual mistakes. The main building of our College houses\nPhysics, Food Science and Physiology and not Microbiology\nand Nutrition as you incorrectly\nstated.. The Atkins building houses the remaining departments of Chemistry, Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Nutrition, Maths etc.\nThere is no U.G.C. Budget for\nQ.E. C. as you have stated in\nyour third pai agar a ph. The2.74m is the allocation for Q.E. C. from the court of the\nUniversity. This is 13.9% less\nthan was received from the court\nof the University in the previous\nyear.\nOur students take great exception to being labelled as\npretty left wing'. We merely feel\nstrongly about the future of our\ncollege and object to radical decisions being made above our\nheads without consultation. The\nEducation Cuts are affecting us\nseverely and( as we believe)\nunfairly. It is an unfortunate state ol affairs when 'activity'\nbecomes labelled as 'left-wing'\nand apathy, as 'right-wing'.\nQ.E. C.S.U. is only proN. U.S. because it is the only way our\nstudents can get their views voiced on substantial issues at a regional or national level. We object strongly to the rather biased attitude to N.l'. S. and our\ninvolvement with that organ-is ation. We certainly are not\nantagonistic', but in a totally\ndiller ent environment to the\naverage I.C. student. I would ask\nyou and your students to bear\nthis in mind. If a merger should\narise then it is important that\nboth Student Unions do their\nbest to protect their membership\nfrom unnecessary inconvenience.\nThe somewhat devi sive attitude\nexpressed in your article does\nnothing to promote open mindedness among your mem!)ers (or\nours for that matter).\nYour closing statement that 'a decision whether or no l to\ncollaborate will be taken by the\ngoverning body by about December\" totally under plays the\nseriousness of the situation. I honestly wonder if Imperial College students have any sensible views at all, because if\nthey have they ought to start\nexpressing them or the whole\nbusiness will IK- done Ix-i brea student view is considered.\nI hope that this letter may\nprovoke some of your students to\nconsider the situation in a more\ncritical but open-minded fashion.\nThe problems of affiliation to\nN.U.S. arc secondary to the\nimmediate issue at stake and its\nimplications.\nl ours sincerely\nChris Sale\nPresident of Queen F^ Iizabeth\nCollege Students' Union Dear Sir\nI have heard it rumoured that\nN.U.S. stands for Nasty Un washed Students. Perhaps you\ncould let me know whether or not\nthis rumour is unfounded.\nYours faithfully\nIvan Itch\nEd's Note: I always thought that\nit stood for National Union of\nSemen, but maybe you're right.\nAny other suggestions?\nPage 2 FELIX, December 18, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Heavy Metal, Cert AA, directed by Gerald\nPottertort, opens at Odeon Kensington\nand all over London tomorrow.\nThis is an animated film consisting of seven\nscenes linked by a green marble representing\nultimate evil in the universe. It is based on the\nwork of several artists from the well-known\nmagazine of the same name.\nAlthough the title makes much of the\nsoundtrack it is not really noticeable, especially if one hasn't heard it before (Devo's reworking of 'Working in a Coalmine' being\nthe most memorable track).\nThe opening scene is of a futuristic and\nviolence-ridden New York where super-cool\ntaxi-driver Harry Canyon picks up the first of\nmany big and beautiful women who are all too\nready to remove their single layer of clothing.\nOther story lines include Den, a super-stud\n(almost) when in possession of the marble and\n'So Beautiful and So Dangerous' which includes\na very funny scene where a crew of spacemen\ntry to dock a spaceship.\nHowever, the best scene is called Capt.\nSternn' where the evil Captain manages to\nacquit himself of more charges than have been\nheard at the Old Bailey this year.\nGenerally good never conquers evil, but\nusually maintains the upper hand. Basically the film is very sound, with the\nseven episodes maintaining the pace well.\nAn alien spaceship hovers above the Pentagon.\nSome of the stories are a little weak and the\nanimation doesn't always work, but it is a bold\nattempt at something new and is on the whole\nenjoyable. Don't be put off by the title either,\nas the music isn't the most important thing.\nSymphony\nOrchestra\nOne's first impression of the Imperial\n. College Symphony Orchestra concert on\nNovember 25th was one of visual splendour.\nThe orchestra occupied fully two thirds of the\nfloor space of the Great Hall, and boasted a violin section large for a professional orchestra. The question in the audience's collective mind as we waited for maestro\nRichard Dickins was, can 1 CSO live up to its\nlooks?\nThe first piece on the programme was the\nAcademic Festival Overture by Brahms, and\nthe orchestra romped cheerfully through this\ntuneful pastiche. Except for a few occasions\nwhen the large first violin section showed less\nsensitivity to the melodic line than Richard\nDick in s' expansive gestures might have indicated, the playing, like the piece itself, was\nloud, happy, and convincing.\nThe orchestra was then joined by soloists\nKrzysztof Smietana (violin), Richard Higgins\n(cello) and Barry Douglas (piano) for the\nBeethoven triple concerto. The long first\nmovement is not one of Beethoven's finest\nefforts, and again, the orchestra had occasional difficulty following the conductor\nthrough the many tempo changes. In the\nsecond movement things began to pick up. In\nthe opening bars the IC SO strings, playing\nwith a richness surely seldom matched by an\namateur orchestra, provided a gorgeous background for Richard Higgins' bewitching\nrst theme. This set the tone for the rest of the\nMovement, in which the soloists made beautiful chamber music, firmly supported by\nthe IC SO at its most sensitive. The third\nmovement belonged to the soloists, who dazzled the audience with their virtuosity,\nproviding a rousing finish to the first half of the\nprogramme.\nBut it was in the second half that the IC SO was truly outstanding. Rimsky Korsakov' s Scheherazade makes huge demands on an\norchestra: there are technically difficult solos\nfor many individual players, and treacherous\nensemble passages, all of which must be\nplayed with an air of effortless ness to be\nconvincing. These difficulties were sur mounted with truly impressive skill. This time,\nthe orchestra followed the conductor's sensitive direction flawlessly, and the lushness\nand opulence of the sound more than adequately reflected the subject. Leader David\nBogle encountered some intonation problems\nin his first solo statement of the theme, but\nsubsequently found his touch, and played the\ndifficult violin solos with laudable style. The\nwind solos were uniformly excellent, with\nspecial credit going to a superb oboe section.\nIn the slow movement, the strings managed to\nbe muted without sounding scratchy, as the\norchestra once again demonstrated the beauty\nof its sound.\nIn all, IC SO performed a daring programme\nwith professional aplomb.\nCharles Bailyn\nFELIX needs\nspace fillers!\nPrince of the City. Directed by Sidney\nLumet, X,167 mins. Opens at Warner\nWest End, ABC Shaftesbury Ave and\nABC Fulham Rd on December 17.\nPrince of the City concerns Detective Daniel\nCiello, who is the head of a special narcotics\ndivision of the New York City Police Department which has been given city-wide\njurisdiction and the ability to put together\ncases anyway they see fit, and his break with\nthe rules of corruption that have been\nestablished in the dealings between cops and\ncrooks and between cops themselves. As the\nfilm progresses and Danny goes undercover\nfor a crime commission he is caught between\nthe dispassionate truth of the law and the truth\nof his friendship with other members of his unit\nwhich is founded on action that transverses\nlegal boundaries.\nIt is the divide between impersonal political\npower that generates, to Danny, an arb it ary legal framework and the personalised, corrupt\nnature of his unit's police work and Danny's attempt to be judged as 'good' by one yet\nsalvage the other, that provides the tension\nwhich threatens to destroy the central character.\nThe plot is fiercely unravelled, tearing\nthrough skillfully portrayed scenes of stark\nintensity or ritual violence, violence being, in\nthis almost totally male film, the major way the\ncharacters express themselves or relate to\neach other. The simple plot, boldly embellished, is for all its energy finally unable to\nsustain the duration of this film, close on three\nhours, and the fluid structure ossifies into a series of scenes where well-heeled lawyers,\nwho ye il d the power to which Danny is\nsubservient, decide his future. The rigidity of\nthese few final scenes traps the characters and\ninvalidates their expression during them.\nHowever, Prince of the City, directed by\nSidney Lumet who is treading ground superficially similar to that which he did with\nSerpicp, is not crippled by its length and much\nof the life of this film abides in the barely\nsketched characters of New York's sei per underworld.\nPage 12 FELIX, December 18, 1981\n\n"

If\nyou have any old clothes, or any food that\nyou don't want to take home (and which\nwill keep until Christmas!) please give it to\nany ICCA G member, or bring it to the\nICCA G room on Monday lunchtime.\nIf you can spare anytime during Christmas week to help at the shelter,\nplease contact Fiona Sinclair, internal 2847,\nfor further details.\nIf you think that you are badly off, come\nand find out what it is really like to be poor\n(remember that the homeless can't get\nsocial security).\nWe served 700 dinners on Christmas Day\nlast year, so you can see we need a lot of\nhelp.\nAnd then the centenary was gone.\nCulminating in the Ball, a marvelous event,\npossibly the best seen in college, certainly the\nbest within the last ten years.

C.B.C. entered\neight crews and two scull ers and the results\nwere as follows:\n1st VIII entered 'open eights' and beat Guys\nHospital in the first round and then lost by\n1/2 length to Kings College in the final.\n2 nd VIII entered senior ' C eights, just won\nthe 1st round against St. Mary's and Kings\nand won the final easily beating ??\nSenior ' C IV, a scratch crew who had never\nrowed together managed to beat London Hospital in the first round. Then in the final\nthey beat U.C.H. easily and forced a dead\nheat with Q.M. C. In the re-row they beat\nQ.M. C. by 2 lengths.\nNovice VIII's We had two entry s to the\nNovice VIII division. These crews consisted\nof people who had not rowed before this\nterm. Due to the bad conditions the ' A' crew\nmanaged to put a sizable hole in their boat\nbefore reaching the start. They had to row\ntheir race in the ' B' crew's boat. This was\npossible since the ' B' crew lost their first race\nthe ' A' crew went on to do the same.\nWomens' ' A' IV entered Womens Open4s, and got a bye to the final then lost to London Hospital and Charing Cross.\nWomens' ' B' IV entered Womens Novice\nIV's, beat Q.M. C. and St. Marys in the 1st round and narrowly lost in the second round.\nSculls B. Bradbury lost in Open Sculls event\nbut won the Senior ' C sculls. A.

Burrows\nReading Novice Regatta\nThis event is organized by Reading University Boat Club for crews of oarsmen\nand oars women who have not rowed before\nthis term. Two mens VIII's were entered.\nWe set off at 8am from Paddington Station\nand when we got to R.U.B. C. at about 9\no' clock the boats had not arrived. This caused minor consternation as the first race\nwas at 10am and the boats had to be put\ntogether. However they soon turned up and\nthe rowing got under way. The' A' crew lost\nfirst to Clare College (the eventual winners).\nThe ' B' crew quickly followed suit losing to\nFitzwilliam and Churchill.\nIn the re per charge event the ' A' crew came\nback from 3rd position to win by a reasonable\nmargin from Jesus College and Oxford Poly.\nIn the second round the crew had a good 1st half and then due to the superior fitness of the\nopposition, they lost. The' B' crew had a 'not\nso hot' start in their race and lost.\nThe day was not quite the resounding\nsuccess that it could have been but everybody\nenjoyed themselves and the boats came back\nin one piece (for a change?).\nft Hockey\nFirsts\nAt last we found another college that play\non Wednesdays! Bedford came to Harlington\nwith visions of beating the in vici ble I.C. side.\nBefore the game their captain was overheard\nsaying that Bedford had not lost for 6 weeks\nand were top of the league. Andy soon shut\nhim up with 4 goals and Geoff added 2 more.\nJon at last found the net from a short-corner\nand to add to Bedfords' misery finally scored\nwith a penalty that only just reached the line.\nTeam: Stutter, Clarke, Riley, Franklin,\nParker, Bell, Ayers, Rao, Baleson, Garms,\nGalley, Coalesworlh.\nSeconds\nThe day started normally enough, about\n20 minutes late! This was to have serious\nconsequences as further delays led to us\narriving late at the Harrow ground. Once the\nmatch started it was obvious that the team\nhad neglected to change from Greenwich\nMeanTime to Harrow MeanTime with the\nresult that Harrow started playing al the\nappointed time and we had just about woken\nup by half time. However, despite intense\npressure and some rather overzealous umpiring, Harrow were only 1-0 up at hall\ntime.\nThis could have been wiped out early in\nthe second half if Phil Webb had not tried to\nengage his brain when faced with a clear\nshot, the resulting panic-stricken pirouette\nsent a clod of turf goal ward while the ball\nremained undisturbed! Further efforts from\nPhil and Manga t Bansal failed to produce an\nequalise r and the game was put out of our\nreach by a line Harrow goal late in the\nsecond half This followed a save from Paul\nButler that would have been thought physically impossible by any normal standards! While falling over one way he\nmanaged to produce a foot flying in the\nopposite direction to clear the ball. Thereafter, the match degenerated, especially when we discovered that their\ngoalkeeper was bar secretary.\nTeam: Butler, Rampton, Roessink, Bird,\nWiddlehead, Pilhketley, Gray, Bansal, Webb,\nWylie, FAdridge, Stroomer.\nPage 18 FELIX, December 18, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "A revised WINE LIST has been put together\njust in time for members of the College, staff\nand students alike, to purchase wines direct\nfrom the cellar. The prices quoted on the list\nare for wines served at functions; any\ncomparison should thus be with prices in\nrestaurants and in wine bars (\u00a31 per glass!!).\nRemember, that when buying for private use a discount of 7.5% is given for purchases of six\nbottles or more, made up mixed as required,\nbut cash or cheque on collection please.\nOrders can be placed with the Refectory\nOffice, ground floor Sherfield, room 104.\nHocks and Moselles will go well with any fish\nand can be drunk as an aperitif; the middle and\nupper quality Hocks will also have the body to\nenhance most poultry and cheeses. The\nnomenclature of German wines is lengthy but\nvery systematic - the terms Spatlese and\nAuslese denote increasing de q rees of original\ngrape-sugar content. A reliable guide to quality\nis of course price. A relatively inexpensive\nHock, based on the Riesling grape, is the\nRudesheimer Rosengarten 1979, and a greater,\nbut more expensive wine is the Schlossbockelheimer Felsenberg 1977. The Moselle wines\nare generally lighter and finer. A good introduction is the Piesporter Michelsberg\n1977 and a delicious but more expensive one is\nthe Avelsbacker Altenberg 1979. The Alsace\nwines on the list can be highly recommended\nand some connoisseurs prefer them above all\nelse.\nThe Common Room Cuvee (Claret to all of\nus but not in the EEC) is good value, only \u00a32.10\nfor a75 cl bottle and remembering the\ndiscount for 6 or more bottles, the price is\n\u00a31.94. The wine is reputed to come from the\nregions around Bordeaux and is bottled\nspecially for I.C.A fresh shipment came in\nabout a month ago. It is well worthwhile\nputting away for six months or longer as it\nimproves in bottle. The Common Room Cuvee is robust and can withstand a good deal\nof mishandling such as being shaken about in\nthe boot of a car on Christmas Eve for drinking\nover the holiday period. It would be a sacrilege\nto do this to the finer Clarets. But whatever is\ndone to it, do not warm it up too quickly nor\ntoo much. Of the finer red Bordeaux wines,\nthe vintages of 1973 and 1976 are drinking very\nwell now and will of course last for many more\nyears. Many on the list are Chateau bottled\n(CB). The Ch. de Pez (1976) is very good value\nfor a lovely wine. The 1978 Ch. Rausan Segla is\ns trick ly for laying down for enjoyment in the\nfuture and a good investment. Clarets should\nbe served at room temperature and the cork\ndrawn several hours beforehand.\nWe have several interesting but nevertheless inexpensive wines from the Loire and\nRhone Valleys, from Provence and some good\nRiojas from Spain. Why not experiment by\nbuying some of each? Regrettably, we cannot\nstock the great names from Burgundy although there are some reasonably priced\nwines on the list. There is also the Common\nRoom Burgundy, red and white. The 1978\nBeaujolais Villages is a good buy and the other\ntwo Beaujolais are beautiful wines albeit\nsomewhat more expensive. As an alternative\nand perhaps with tongue in cheek, try some of\nthe Californian wines which were bought when\nthe dollar was at a low. The red Californian\nwines are big, full bodied and with lots of\nalcohol; they will stay for a long time and may\nturn out to be the bargain for the 1980's. The\nFirestone Merlot (1977) is quite exquisite and\nanyone who had not tasted a wine made from\nthe famous Merlot grape should take the\nopportunity. The white wines are also typical\nand good value.\nTo finish a meal, what about some Port? We\nhave a vintage port (not listed), a1967 Cockburn at \u00a37.50 a bottle. Or 'have some\nMadeira, my or as a very special treat have\nthe Janneau Armagnac.\nHave a good Christmas.\nP. Grootenhuis\nChairman, Wine Committee\n7S M*y.... at last\nu Jed.

    "content": "The real horror of\nLinstead\nLinstead Hall is the most recently built of\nIC's accommodation for students and has the\nbest self-catering provision in college halls,\nparticularly in the recent extension, where\nthere is at least one kitchen per ten residents.\nDespite this, Linstead is the only hall to have\nan evening meal served every weekday for\nwhich students must pay at the beginning of\nterm with their room fees. The meals cost\n\u00a31.50 each: residents may obtain a refund of\nslightly less than this for up to two meals per\nweek by signing out.\nThere is widespread dissatisfaction with this\nservice. The Union report on the recent\nrefectories questionnaire is noticeably 'soft' on\nthe college catering services in some areas, but\nthe section on the Linstead service is headed\n' The real horror of L instead'. The questionnaire results revealed that 'huge majorities\nfelt the meal was not hot enough, badly served\nand presented and that something was wrong\nwith the food itself. There were complains\nabout 'soggy food', under cooking, 'terrible'\nmeat and fish, ' dry mash',' overcooked cauliflower', 'soggy pastry', 'melted ice cream',\nas well as about 'the behaviour and appearance of staff; 'obnoxious and filthy' was one'.\nAccording to the report 'residents do not feel\nthey get value for money', and the last of its\neleven conclusions is: 'The food in Linstead is\ntotally unacceptable. This situation must be\nreviewed immediately'.\nMeat in Linstead's meals is frequently visibly\nundercooked - this is not only aesthetically\noffensive but also a danger to health. There\nhave been several 'actual case(s) and rumours\nof food poisoning'* already this term, and\nalthough obviously the source of these infections cannot be determined definitely,\nmany residents are convinced that the\nLinstead meals were responsible. Cutlery is\nfrequently coated with greasy fingerprints and\nsometimes carries visible remnants of the\nprevious day's meal; plates and bowls are\nrarely even apparently clean and are often wet.\nLeaving aside considerations of hygiene, the\nmeals are very rarely wholly satisfactory to a majority of the residents. Meat served without\nsauce and fish are usually at best lukewarm:\nvegetables are uninspiring in general. Portion\nsize is another source of complaint. The amount of meat presented is usually in inverse\nproportion to its to ler ability, while chips, one\nof the few items which are anywhere near\nregularly acceptable, are always provided in\ntotally inadequate amounts.\nDespite the effective financial loss incurred,\nsome Linstead residents attend less than three\nmeals per week simply because of the\nun attractiveness of the food.\nOverall the meals are often described as\n'worse than college refectory food', there being\nat least a choice of food in the main college\nrefectories. The personal hygiene of some of\nthe catering staff is viewed with suspicion by\nmany residents^\nLinstead Hall was built with money from an\nanonymous benefactor who stipulated that\nstudents should eat in hall; other schools of the\nUniversity received similar donations at the\nsame time. IC secretary John Smith says the\nintention of the benefactor was to 'improve the\nquality of student life' in London by the\nintroduction of this 'Oxbridge' system of meals\nin hall. When Linstead's extension was built,\nenquiries were made about the possibility of a change in the system, but these revealed a fairly 'firm attitude' against such a change.\nHowever, Mr. Smith thought that in view of\nthe 'rapidly changing eating habits' of students\nthe matter must be looked into again.\nThe present service may fit the letter of the\nconditions attached to the donation, but it can\nhardly be in the spirit of the benefactor's intention if the meals only serve to unite\nresidents in their dissatisfaction with the food.\n(\u2022s fe Linstead Hall Ct tee Meeting minutes\n17.11.81)\nA Christmas\nTale\nWith Christmas approaching the thoughts\nof most ordinary folks turn to food and festivities (unless they've already been in the\norientation for some time already). However,\nsuch things don't happen in the peculiar world\nof Science and Technology. Instead we\nconcentrate on that fine old institution, the\nChristmas test.\nThis reminds me of an occasion some years\nago when two aging Professors, both FRS, began at first contemplating, next discussing\nand finally arguing about the quality of their\nfreshmen. However, preserving a sense of\ndignity they decided that the noble way to\nsettle this was on the results of the Christmas\ntest.\nIt has long been accepted in the de pts and\nindeed anywhere academics frequented that\nthe Christmas tests of eight years ago had\nboth been comparable in difficulty and classics\nof their genre\nIt was agreed however for the sake of\nchange that the actual figures should be\nchanged as identical tests in different years is\njust not allowed.\nSo the Profs went off to their rooms to\nlocate the papers and make the necessary\nalterations.\nHowever, one chap, being slightly more\nkeen than the other took to phrase 'the\nactual figures should be changed' to heart and\nconcocted a devious plot by which he lowered\nthe degree of accuracy required and generally\nmanipulated many figures; including such basics as pi so that they all cancelled out the\nanswer fell out, so to speak.\nNaturally his students romped home in the\ntest and the other Prof, like the gentleman he\nwas, conceded defeat.\nHowever, two students from the two different departments happened to compare their\npapers and immediately realized the dastardly\ndeed one of the Prof's had lowered himself to.\nNaturally the students rushed to the Rector,\nwho has the last word on such matters, but\nbeing the Rector and having the political knowhow to keep all sides happy (and make his own\nlot easier) the only comment he offered was\nthe sardonic 'Obviously the constants were\nfixed'.\nAn Appeal\nAn organisation called ACTIVE, which helps\ndisabled children and adults, has asked us to\nhelp it by suggesting new toys, devices, aids or\nwhatever for the severely disabled.\nURO P is taking this under its wing and if you\ncan think up a bright idea URO P will find a supervisor to help you develop it.\nACTIVE has funds both to pay for a limited\namount of materials and to support a student\nworking full-time on his idea during the\nSummer vac action. The difference in ACTIVE's approach is that\nthey aim to make their end product a 'Worksheet' which gives full instructions for\nthe disabled person, or someone helping him,\nto construct the device themselves. In this way\none-off and special designs can be arrived at to\nmeet a particular individual's needs.\nThus the work is a double challenge\u2014to\nthink up the toy or whatever in the first place,\nand then to develop it in a form that can be\nduplicated by relatively unskilled people\nworking in their homes.\nThe need is for play, leisure and communication aids of all kinds\u2014we want your ideas!\nFor further details contact Professor J.C. Anderson, Electrical Engineering Dept.\nFEUX, December 18, 1981 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "The Birth of FELIX\nOn the occasion of the 600th issue, we look back at the history of FELIX.\nThe first issue of FELIX was published on\nFriday, December 9, 1949 in the form of a14 page r one oed newspaper. The opening words\nwere:\nThe need has been felt for some time for a frequently published journal to comment upon\nthe affairs of the College whilst they are still\ntopical, and to bring to the attention of its\nmembers the activities of clubs and societies.\nThe introduction went on to mention The\nPhoenix and how FELIX may complement, if\nnot compliment, the literary magazine in the\nfuture. This indeed happened and it could be\nsaid that the cat has now got the better of the\nbird.\nThe Christening\nConcerning the title of the newspaper, the\nfirst edition included the following:\nA debt of gratitude is owed to F.C. Ewels for\nhis suggestion of a title. He should be\nrewarded with a saucer of milk.\nThe paper remained in its original format\nthroughout the 49/50 session and averaged\naround 10 pages. The first Editor E.M. Hughes\nproduced nine issues at fortnightly intervals\nand charged a price of 3d. Six hundred copies\nof the first edition sold out fast, as indeed did\nthe second of one thousand. Indeed, there\nwere reports of a thriving black market where\ncopies exchanged hands at twice their face\nvalue.\nIssue 10 heralded a new format at the start\nof a new academic year. Only four pages were\nproduced, although the reduced type size\nallowed the content to remain at its previous\nlevel. That year saw 15 FELICE S, some of 6\npages.\nDuring the first year of production, only\nissues 8 and 9 carried cover stories, while\nregular items such as a regular character\nprofile and The Drinking Man's Guide to\nLondon were established. Topics of interest\nback in 1950 included refectories and The\nPhoenix, but undoubtedly the main source of\nnews was the activities of students themselves.\nTheir frequent illegal activities and subsequent\nrun-ins with the police formed the basis of\nmany fascinating columns.\nOther unusual items included the cover\nstory of issue 9, which concerned the sacking\nof Mr Sellars, butler in the Dining Hall! Also, it\nmay be of interest that in 1950 the Commemoration Day Ball was held in the\nGrosvenor House Hotel at a cost of 17/6d each.\nReading through earlier copies of FELIX\nmakes one realise how much some things have\nchanged, while others remain exactly the\nsame. For instance, J. V. Bramley, advisory\nThe cover of the first issue\nof FELIX which appeared\nthir tv two years ago. Six\nhundred copies were made\nwhich sold at 3d each. The\nfirst Editor was E.M. Hughes, who produced nine\nissues.\neditor in 1956/7, said in the classic Christmas\narid 100th issue:\nThe impression one gets from earlier issues\nis that the College was more alive than now.\nA FELIX first-the page\n3 girl from issue 11,\nOctober 10, 1950.\nThe current Deputy President, Mr Barney\nMcCabe, may feel that his recent \"Universal\nEnjoyment Equation\" was original, but the idea\ncropped up as far back as FELIX no. 5:\nThe Mathematician's Courtship Let x denote beauty; y, Manners well-bred;\nz, Fortune-f This last is essential).\nLet L stand for Love, our Philosopher said,\nThen L is a function of x,y, and z, Of the kind that is known as potential.\nNow integrate L with respect to dt,\n(t standing for time and persuasion)\nThen, within proper limits, 'tis easy to see,\nThe definitive integral Marriage must be.\n(A very concise demonstration).\nAnother example of early wit included:\nStratification\nGirls at College are in two strata,\nGirls with dates, and those with data.\n1956 produced some very interesting items.\nThe Dramatic Society produced \"The Ladies\nnot for Burning\"; a certain Card Fiddler wrote\na letter in praise of UL U cards; Sir John\nBetjemen (later to be Poet Laureate) said\n\"scientists and technologists have far more\nsense of responsibility than the arts graduate\nin the problems of aesthetic nature.\"\nThere was also a headline \"Well done Mr Mooney\" which was meant most sincerely.\nAs time passed, circulation increased and\nhad reached 1,400 by the summer of 1957. The\nprice remained at 3d, although some extra\nlarge editions were 6d and very small ones only\nId. However when the price was raised to 4d on the Charter Jubilee issue (No. 108, Friday\nMay 31, 1957) the circulation also rose to\n1,500.\n\n"

Production difficulties have\nonce more raised their ugly head. Having decided to spend a week and a half producing a bigger, special issue everything seemed to be set\nfor a smooth run. However the typesetter operator fell ill and two days were lost before a temporary operator was employed to replace her for\nthe last three days of last week. This meant that\nwe have to work through the weekend and have\nhad the normal measure of late nights and two\nmore days work to boot. Such is life.\nICQ EC Merger\nFollowing last Wednesday's Board of Studies\nmeeting (the College's highest academic committee) it seems that the Rector has come up with\nan amended draft proposal which is much more\nacceptable. This will be discussed by another\nBoard of Studies meeting today. Thus we will\nknow the final draft proposal which will be put to\nGoverning Body in time for the Emergency\nU GM on Thursday (at l pm in Me ch Eng 220).\nSo if you want to find out exactly what is now\nproposed you should turn up to that meeting and\nlet your views be known.\nThe year so far\nIt hardly seems like a term is over already.\nFrom the security of my office it is sometimes\ndifficult to gauge feeling at College, but I think\nit's been a really dull period, with little\nhappening to fire the imagination apart from\nthe RCS Centenary celebrations. Rag Week\ncontained the usual madness, but the\nlack of any new ideas was disappointing.\nAs far as IC Union goes, it seems that things\nare ticking over once more with the President\nsoft soaping College and generally being so\ndiplomatic that they're going to trample all\nover him (and us!) if he's not careful. It's all\nvery well trying to be \"reasonable\" but we have\nto consider the interests of the students. His\nsluggish response over the QE C merger and\n(barely) token opposition to the mid-session al rent rise for next term is worrying. Barney\nMcCabe seems to be fulfilling the worst of my\nexpectations, but at least he's exhibiting some\n-ort of charade- and isn't half as boring as the\nother two.\nAs lor me, ! m tired again.\nCredits\nA special thank you to all the people who\nhave contributed to this issue: Peter Rodgers,\nJames Deeny, Martin S.

    "content": "CLUBS AND SOCIETIES\nGoGo is potentially the most successful of the\nintellectual games, including chess, bridge\nor bird watching. This may be proved at South\nSide or abroad.\nIt is a strategic board game for two players, a war game with art, if you like.\nRegarding its origins, go is an oriental game.\nIt is thousands of years old. It is not too difficult\nto experiment and see that go is simpler and\nmore interesting than any ot ber board or card\ngame. The matchless simplicity of the rules\nmakes it easy to learn quickly, but it can take a lifetime to get the most from the game. It\nis enjoyable not only to experienced players\nbut also to beginners and t bey can play each\nother, because the differences can be levelled\nby a very natural handicap system.\nThe game is played by placing black and\nwhite men, astonishingly called stones, one by\none in turn on the go board, over the\nintersection of the lines. The aim is to share\nthe territory which is given by the 181 points\navailable on the board (19 by 19 intersections).\nThere is no way of ending in a draw. The\nwinner is the player, who after the ending\narrangements has formed group of stones in\nsuch a way that they are surrounding larger\nnumber of unoccupied positions that that\nachieved by the opponent.\nThe stones positioned in the beginning are\njust laying claim for areas. Sooner or later the\nlocal situation can sharpen into a dispute and\nfarther on into a fight for life.\nThe actual playing ends when there is an\nagreement about it, that is when it becomes\nclear that there is no chance or possibility of\nincreasing territory either in a peaceful way or\nby making stones prison or killing them. It may\nlook a bloody game and that is it for nasty\npeople.\nTo reactivate the go club this year again in\nthe College there is a need of 20 signatures for\nstart of people interested in playing the game\nand concerned with forming the club. Meetings will be held as usual once or twice a week in Stan's( South Side over the running\npints). If interested, please contact the people\nyou can find in small ads.\nAngling\nIf all went according to plan, I.C. Angling Club became the newest club in R.C. C. last\nnight. We will be getting headed notepaper\nsoon! Malcolm Brain would be proud of us.\nActivities have been low key recently,\nwith at idd ler snatching session on the\nGrand Union Canal and a non-event at\nWaltham st on reservoirs. The last trip for\nthis term is this weekend( contact Dave\nKel s all, Che m.En g.PG, int. 2594 for\ndetails).\nNext term we shall be fishing on the\nfollowing weekends:\n16/17th Jan.30/31 st Jan.13/14 th Feb.\n27/28th Feb.\n13/ 14th March( end of season special event)\nOne of those weekends could be a sea\nfishing trip, but we need a sea commodore to help organise it - any offers?\nOn a final note, we will be off to Ireland\nnext summer. Places will be strictly limited.\nIf you are interested in visiting the angling mecca, your first step could be coming along to one of our informal Thursday evening meetings at 5.45pm in Southside\nbar.\nUnited Nations\nI find it very sad (to say the least) that at a time when world poverty is at an all time\nhigh and continues to be an insult to\nhumanity, when the UK Government's indifference to major international issues\nresults in savage cuts in foreign aid. big\ncuts in university education and the\ntraining of overseas students, and the\nblatant disregard of much of the UN's work, nearly everyone in the college chooses to sit back and forget about it all.\nThe UN society is striving to enlighten\nmembers of college on these matters and to campaign on them, but because of a very poor response to a request for vacant\ncommittee posts to be filled at the_ beginning of term, very little has been\ndone. I would urge anyone who has the\nslightest interest or concern about world\npoverty and development, multilateral disarmament, and university education in\nthe international and national context( areas not covered by other societies in the\ncollege) to come to a brief meeting on\nThursday December17( tomorrow) at\n1.00pm in the Union Upper Lounge and\nvolunteer to contribute in the running of\nthe society. If a good strong committee is\nformed only a modest contribution is\nrequired from each committee member.\nEnts\nTonight is, of course-your last chance to\nenjoy yourself before heading back to the\nprovinces. I refer to the 'Xmas ... at last' party\nwith ' A Blue Zoo' and ' Wa pa cha' both bands\nachieving good reactions at recent London\ndates and both highly dance able. Also, cartoons starring Tom, Jerry and Pink Panther\n- who have just returned from a world wide\ntour, Crimbo disco and bars, which go without\nsaying really! What more can \u00a31 buy you?\nTomorrow is the last film of term - Smokey\nand the Bandit Ride Again and next term sees\nsuch films as Star Trek, McVicar, Flash\nGordon, Airplane, Being There, China\nSyndrome, Any Which Way You Can and The\nGreat Rock'n 'Roll Swindle.

    "content": "Phew! What a Scorcher!\nStrewth! What a bore!\nICU Council met on Monday of this week. The meeting was\neven longer and more arduous than usual with the proposed\nIC QE C merger taking up well over an hour. The sabbaticals\nwere also censured by the meeting for being 20 minutes late.\nBy shortly alter 6:00pm approximately 30 members of Council had\nassembled in the S CR, but the Chairman, Nick Morton and the\nDeputy President and Hon Sec were not in attendance. The meeting\nwas opened at 6:15pm and a motion of censure proposed by Martin Taylor was passed by an overwhelming majority.\nWhen the sabbaticals eventually arrived the meeting heard reports\nfrom most Union Officers and then passed on to the ICQ EC motion.\nThis was proposed by Martin Taylor, External Affairs Officer, who.\nafter making a proposal speech, had to answer a long series of\nquestions. An amendment to delete all ol the motion and simply\noppose the merger was defeated. After one and a quarter hours the\nmotion was eventually passed by a substantial majority.\nThe meeting also discussed the purchase of a new baby grand piano\nfor the Concert Hall. Some members felt that the expenditure of/2,600\nhad been made without adequate consultations.\nAlter finally approving the Executive and other committee meetings, the meeting eventually finished at 10:20pm. Pass the sick\nbag, Alice!\nThe Rag Chairman. Bill Durodie,\nhas resigned, it was announced at\nCouncil on Monday. Ronan McDonald, Rag Secretary, is to\nbecome acting Rag Chairman until an election is held.\nBill Durodie. in his letter of\nresignation, said that he felt it\nwas better for Rag if he left the\npost now rather than at the end\nof the year, in order to let\nsomeone else takeover. He denied that it had anything to do\nwith Rag's failure to obtain collection licences, for which he\nhas been much criticized.\nShaky Chair\nA recent report in ,\\'ni' Scientist\nstated that IC was in danger of\nlosing its gift of a Leverhulme\ngrant to fund a chair in biotech-no logy. The report (.Xen Scientist. Dec3)\nsuggested that IC could not\n\"come up with the new posts the\nchair requires\" and that the\nLeverhulme Trust might have to\nplace its money elsewhere.\nIn fact, the difficulty lies in\nfunding the backup facilities\n(including research stall) since\nthe grant will only cover the new\nProfessor's salary'.\n_5J a Hordes of merry students crammed- every available space in College\nearlier in the week to enjoy the unexpected spell of good weather. The happy revellers pelted each other with snowballs and built snowmen. A group effort by Ci vEng2 produced the excellent \"snow lion\"( above)\nalongside the real lions at the bottom of the Queens Tower.\nBarney's grand new baby\nDeputy President Barney McCabe, recently purchased a brand new\nbaby grand piano for the Union Concert Hall. The piano, which cost\n^\u00a32,635 and was purchased from Harrods, has become the subject of\nsome controversy.\nA meeting of House Committee approved the money for the piano.\nHowever, discussions about a replacement for the present piano, which\nis in an appalling state, have been taking place between the DP and\ninterested groups (such as Music Society and Operatic Society) for\nsome time. These groups had advised that a reconditioned lull-size\ngrand piano should have been bought, at approximately the same cost.\nBy the time they heard that their advice was to be disregarded the new\npiano had already been paid for and it was too late lor objections to be\nraised. Members of Council who disagreed with the purchase were\nsimilarly unable to reverse the decision, due to a rare example of\nefficiency and swift action on the part of the Deputy President.\nSTOP PRESS\nAnyone paying rent over the vacation could try applying for Supplementary\nBenefit even if they will be going home, since it is strongly rumoured that\nstudents will not be asked to sign on during the three week period.\nFinancial assistance for Malaysian students suffering from financial hardship available.\nFor further information contact Student Services.\nBuy Life Membership NOW.

    "content": "Welcome to the Christmas special! For those\nof you who are new to the end-of-term puzzle\npage, the puzzles are of two types. The unmarked puzzles are for amusement only,\nand tend to be less than serious in nature. The\ns worded puzzles, on the other hand, each\ncarry a \u00a35 prize in the usual way, and there is\nalso a \u00a310 voucher (redeemable at Mend-a Bike) for the person who answers the most\ns worded puzzles correctly.\nAnswers to me at the FELIX Office by\n1:00pm on the first Wednesday of next term. If\nyou submit answers to more than one puzzle,\nthere is no need to write the answers on separate slips of paper.\nt Taking Notes\nBarney McCabe has put so much time\nand effort into discovering the most\nirresponsible method for disposing \u00a33000\nof Union money that he is naturally quite\nkeen to protect the piano in question, and\nto this end he has put it at the back ofthe\nmusic store for the duration of tonight's party. Unfortunatelyhehasn't yet worked\nout how to get it out again...\nThe difficulty arises on two counts.\nFirstly, there's no room to turn any ofthe\nobjects round without damaging them, so\nhe will have to get the piano out by sliding\nthings backwards and forwards without\nturning them round.\nAnd secondly, there's an officious\nsecurity regulation which prohibits him\nfrom moving anything out ofthe cupboard\n(i.e. off the shaded area) unless he is going\nto remove it, and the only thing he needs\nto remove is the grand piano. Any offers\nof help?\nThanks to...Oliv o Miotto, Dr John Conway,\nand Grey Spider. Good luck, Merry Christmas, and io io io! Last Week's Solution\nBlanche had just castled on the queen's side.\nSo Wodge was able to deduce that her King's rook was unable to escape from his original\ncorner, and so the rook on Q3 must be a promoted pawn. But White can only have\nmade such a promotion if Black has moved her\nking. (This can be deduced from the pawn\nstructure.) So Black cannot castle. With this\ndeduction made, White must castle (as indeed\nshe did) and it is then a simple matter to force\nmate in the required number of moves.\nAs many of you pointed out, the solution to\nthe previous week's puzzle was wrongly\nprinted in last week's FELIX.

As a result the game generally went IC's way with\ntries by Will Chapman, Mick Winsor and a hattrick from Jim Austin, the third one\nconverted with devastating accuracy by\ncaptain Steve Bell, looking for his place in the\n1st XV as regular goal kicker perhaps?\nDespite some good running, fullback Myles Thompson managed to retain his try\nscoring virginity by pulling a hamstring and\nfalling flat inches from the line, and had to\nleave the pitch.\nDuring the last 10 minutes play became\nver v fluid, with Mick Winsor making some\ndazzling cross-pitch breaks before the referee\nended the game at 24-0.\nP.S.

It is well known in\njournalistic circles that The Times\ncannot be argued with on such\nmatters. Paisley's reported election successes show how stupid\" the majority\" of his\nelectorate are.\n1 ours etc\nGam Owen Dear Mark\nI am writing to inform you of a very disturbing occur enc e.I am a resident in Garden Hall and since the beginning of term we\nhave had no laundry facilities, as\nour washing machine is in the\nprocess of being moved. This has\nmeant a weekly trip to Weeks\nHall to use theirs, an arrangement consented to by the War den. We have always endeavour ed to use the laundry at the\nleast busy times to cause the\nminimum of inconvenience.\nHowever, this week we arrived\nto find that the students (not the\nWarden) had asked for the lock\nto the laundry door to be\nchanged to prevent us from using\nit. I find this attitude towards\nfellow students in need totally\ndisgusting and am appalled by\nthe lengths to which they have\ngone to make life difficult for\nus. If this is the general attitude\ntowards fellow students, then the\nICQ EC merger hasn't got a cat\nin hell's chance.\nTours disgustedly\nDuncan Reid Dear Mark\nI would like to draw the\nattention of your readers to some\nrecent incidents in one of the\nstudent houses in Evelyn Gar dens.\nTwo residents of Room4 G4 in\nBernard Sunley House have just\nbeen fined \u00a315 each for damage\nto their room. They had adorned\nthe walls with writing and drawings in black marker pen.\nThe warden of the house discovered this, purely by chance,\nearly last week. He explained to\nthem that they had committed a very serious offence and left with\nthe message that he would come\nback to them on the matter.\nThe following day, the students spent several hours cleaning\nthe walls and there is. now no\nmark to be seen. Indeed, it is\nquite impossible to tell that there\never was any graf litt i. The warden has seen the walls,\nand acknowledges that the students have done an efficient\njob-Nevertheless, he has still imposed the \u00a315 fine (which is\nhalf suspended i.e. \u00a3 7 . 5 0 is\nreturnable at the end of the year,\nproviding there is no breach of\nregulations by these students).\nIt is highly unlikely that the\nDisciplinary Committee would\nrepeal the fine should they appeal against it.\nDo you think that it is fair to\nimpose such a heavy fine for\ndamage which has been completely repaired?\nComments in reply would be\nappreciated.\nyours\nJ. Humphreys\nEd's Note: It should have been\n\u00a320! Merry Christmas!\n,Sir\nYour current campaign against Mr. Nick Morton is\ndisgraceful. Some of the things\nyou have said in it are tantamount to suggesting that not\nonly is he President of ICU, but\nthat he regularly crawls to\nCollege. Living in Princes Gardens myself I can assure you\nthat he regularly walks.\n1 ours\nPettifogger Jarnoyce BSc\nEd's Note: It's so good to see\nthat the spirit of ben cvo lant good\nwill, tolerance and understanding which has been so much in\nevidence on the letters page this\nterm has at last reached a crescendo this week.

OOPM.\nNEXT UGM\nTO BE HELD ON JANUARY 26TH IN THE\nGREAT HALL AT l. OOPM.\nDEADLINE FOR MOTIONS TO APPEAR IN\nFELIX 12.30 THURSDAY, 14TH JANUARY.\nMOTION ON PROPOSED IC/QEC MERGER\nProposed by: External Affairs Committee.\nICU Notes:\n1. The draft statement of intent issued jointly by the Rector of\nImperial College and the Principal of Queen Elizabeth College on\n2nd December 1981.\n2. That this draft statement of intent calls for a merger of Imperial\nCollege and QEC bioscience s, the extra departments to be\naccommodated in a new building on the I.C. site.3. That the statement calls for all the bioscience departments\n(including those currently part of the Royal College of Science)\nto become a fourth constituent college, Queen Elizabeth College.\n4. That the statement calls for closer collaboration between the\ncolleges and especially between the departments concerned over the\nnext four to five years before the merger takes place in1986. ICU Believes:\n1. That the proposed merger is in general acceptable. The expansion\nof the college with the provision of a new building and new fields of study within bioscience s can strengthen the college.\n2. That the proposed merger would become unacceptable if there were\nno new building on the IC site to accommodate those parts of QEC\nwhich were to come here and it were.to result in a split site college.\n3. That all the physical sciences staff and students must be\naccommodated elsewhere in the university. There must be no\nattempt to bring them to I.C. under the guise of being 'bioscience\nrelated'.\n4. That the concept of a fourth all-bioscience s constituent college\nhas no historical precedent, nor is it a practical proposition.\nAll parts of QEC which it is.proposed to merge with I.C. must\nbecome part of the Division of Life Sciences which must remain an\nintegral part of the Royal College of Science.\n5. That assurances must be given that a) the status of Silwood Park\nwill remain unchanged; b) the Hall of Residence at QEC will be\nmaintained and come under the I.C. Student Services Office;\nc) that students will be adequately consulted at each stage of the\nmerger process and shall be represented on the Joint Planning\nCommittee which it is proposed to set up.\n6. That further assurances must be given as to the maintenance of\nacademic standards and entry standards in all parts of I.C., and\nthe maintenance of student numbers in the university as a whole.\nICU Resolves:\n1. To reaffirm its policy on education cuts.\n2. To play a full part in the continuing negotiations surrounding\nthe merger.\nICU Instructs:\n1. All Union Officers, the Student Observers on Governing Body and\nthe Student Members of Board of Studies to press for changes in the draft statement of intent inline with the above policy, with\nguidance from the Union Council.\n2. That in the event of the views of the Union as outlined above\nbeing disregarded in the formulation of plans for a merger, the\nExternal Affairs Committee to refer the matter back to a UGM.\nFEUX, December 18, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Although Friday has been the favourite day\nfor publication, that has not always been so.\nThe fresher s' edition of 1957 was published on\na Saturday, while A.T. Pawlowicz (1962/3) and\nD.J. Williams (1965/6) had particular aversions\nto Fridays (of course Mark Smith only ever\npublishes on Fridays).\nBasically the editorial style of FELIX remained the same until the last issues of the\n58/59 session (nos. 134, 135) when under the\neditorship of M.R. Honer comparisons and\ncorrespondence with editors of other student\nnewspapers in London began.\nThe problem was students at Imperial\nthought FELIX was not of the same quality of\nother student publications and improved printing methods and the higher cost ensued\ncould only be achieved by capital investment.\nThe only way to achieve this was advertising.\nThe editor totally disagreed with advertising\nand also asked who would want to advertise in\nsuch a paper.\nThe dilemma remained until the following\neditorial appeared in 155:\nEdltmiat Comment\nYOUR\" HEW LOOK\" FELIX. Well, here it is. You may think it is\nrather small so here are a few facts and\nfigures to explain why. The wet of printing an eight page FELIX by the method\nt ned before, that is the \" offset\" process,\nwas about \u00a318.\nYou, our readers, contributed regularly\nshout \u00a3 1 5 towards this; the remaining \u00a3 3\nor so being made up from she Union funds.\nThe paper which you are reading now\nhas cost \u00a328 to print, and only four pages\nat that IT his leaves a deficit of \u00a3 1 3 . It\nis hoped that most of this will be regained\nin future by selling advertising space at\nthe rates shown elsewhere, but for the time being this extra oost is being borne by the\nUnion. Like all business ventures we need\nao ert a in amount of capital to start the\nball rolling. Should our financial turnover\nfrom advertising reach higher proportions\nthen we can go ahead and print larger\ncopies of FELIX, but for the present we\nshall have to be content with these four\npages.\nFELIX ADVERTISING RATES.\nQUARTER PAGE5 GUINEAS Either: two columns wide by half \u00ab\nhigh. or: four columns wide by quarter column high. \u00b0 NE EIGHTH PAGE3 GUINEAS Either: tw c columns wide by quarter\ncolumn high.*! one column wide by half column high. \u00b0 NE SIXTEENTH PAGE30 Bh. One column wide by quarter oo lu mn high.\nSaturdays to i2 Pm GRAND FINALE DANCE\n3 BARS tickets10 s each with JIM l HENDRIX EXPERIENCE supporting groups The first advertisements to appear were\nsmall ones (although various hosteler ies had\nbeen receiving free publicity for years) and\nLamleys were the most regular customers.\nIssue 170 saw a half-page advert by Bristol\nSiddley Engines and the fresher s' edition of\n1962 contained a half-page ad from The Times\n(who were to subscribe regularly) and a complete back page ad by Westminster Bank.\nBack to Front\nAs time passed the front page began to\nconcentrate more on Union politics with some\nsplendid headlines:\nQuorate Union Meeting\n600 Turn Up\nNo Apathy Here\n(No 182)\nSurprise! Union Meeting Postponed\n(No 186)\nNUS AT LAST\n(No 187)\nand so on\nIt may be of interest that in issue 222 (Nov\n1965) the headline was ' Free Vote for\nPresidency' but the time-span of this article (to\nthe end of 66/67 session) does not include the\ntime when a free election replaced a Council\nvote as a method of electing the next\nPresident.\nTwo of the major events concerning students this year have been the resurgence of\nC ND, including the march to Hyde Park, and\nthe controversy surrounding the Rag Mag.\nSuch events are not new to Imperial. The\ncover story of 168 (Friday, November 24,\n1981) told of aqu or at eUG M almost unanimously passing a motion \"that ICC ND be reinstated forthwith'. If had been disbanded by Council the year before. The\nclosing sentence of the article was also very\npleasing and, indeed, surprising. 'This was an\nusually pleasant and fruitful Union meeting, far\nbetter than the procedure-bound slang ing matches that we sometimes have to endure'.\nfC4 iV PACKS PUNCH\nFRIDAY ll t.h NOVEMBER. N \u00b0 15 2\n4s FELIX 246, May 10 1967\nAs mentioned above1958/59 was a traumatic year for publishing in ICU. While the\nthoughts which were to revamp FELIX were\nbeing born, a controversy arose over the\neditor of Phoenix. The winter Phoenix of that\nyear was edited by D. Irving and included a very fascist editorial and an attack on Prof\nBlackett. However in its defence the magazine\nwas of a high technical standard and profitable.\nMr Irving then fled the country and was\nrelieved of his post.\nHowever he returned to edit another publication, the Carnival Times, but his efforts\nto include an eight-page supplement of racist\nand fascist jokes were thwarted.\nff t iX WELCOMES\nFRESHERS\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nThe various structural changes throughout\nthe College are also well documented in\nFELIX, especially the work of the architect\nColcutt along Imperial Institute (including the\nerection of the Queens Tower), the building of\nthe Union and the Southside Halls of\nResidence. One classic headline was \"Slow\nProgress: Southside nearing completion a sym to tic ally\". Issue 226 included some very interesting\ntopics including \" Me ch Eng to go metric\", a photo of Mike being cast and the Editor\nexplaining why FELIX no longer had anonymous columnists!\n1966/67 was really the last year of the\noriginal FELIX as the next session's copies\nwere totally different in format. However the.\n\" Hops\" organised by the Union were still going\nstrong and advertisements for salesgirls still\nappeared as it was still a few years before\nFELIX was to become a free publication.\nPeople in the news even then included Prof\nAbdus Salam and Prof. Eric Laithwaite.\nPersonally the most exciting thing to emerge\nfrom my reading was the advert for the Carnival\nwhich appeared in issue246 and the\nsubsequent photo of Jimi Hendrix in 247.\nTo be continued\n\n"
