    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nRoll over Fauldgate and tell Beethoven the news.\nUnbearably\nPompous\nCritics\nBeethoven's Tenth by Peter Ustinov,\ndirected by Robert Chetwyn, Vaudeville\nTheatre.\nThe curtain rises on an extremely elegant\nand smart interior. It is the living room of\nStephen Fauldgate (Robin Bailey). Mr\nFauldgate is an eminent music critic whose\nspecial study outside the contemporary scene\nis Beethoven. He is fastidious in his choice of\nwords. Unfortunately he is also unbearably\npompous and overflowing with self importance.\nHis son, Pascal (Reece Dinsdale) complains of\nhis 'writings of intolerable pretension'. Pascal is\na22 year-old aspiring composer who 'writes\nfacile symphonies in menacing profusion'\u2014\naccording to his dad. His works are 'tepid,\nvapid and trivial'. (Father and son are at odds,\nyou see.) Mr Fauldgate's wife (played by Dilys\nLaye) is a former mezzo-soprano who gave up\nher career to make peace between her two\nmen. The other member of the household is\nIrmgard (Clare Higgins), an Austrian au pair,\nwhose childhood was spent with Beethoven's death mask over her cot and whose pocket-money was spent attending concerts of his\nmusic.\nDuring a family quarrel, Fraulein Irmgard\ncloses her eyes, clenches her fists, and with\ngermanic determination exclaims 'Iv ish Beethoven vere here. I \u2014vis h \u2014Beethoven\u2014\nvere\u2014here.' Immediately there is a knock on\nthe door. A large and very old figure enters. It is\nHerr Beethoven. His appearance is alarming:\nshuffling gait and badly stooping, shabby old\nclothes, anarchic hair and restless jowls. He\nmutters German.\nPeter Ustinov plays the maestro in this his\nnew play. Mr Ustinov, as one would guess, is\nsuperbly suited to this role. A very talented\nactor, playwright, novelist, linguist and above\nall a master of impersonation of the European\ncharacter, Ustinov lends a very humorous and\nclever performance. Beethoven's Tenth is\ninventive, honest and human and rather than\nfollow a single line or pursue a particular idea,\nthe play instead airs a diversity of Ustinovian\nphilosophy. However, the play does home in\non three things: an homage and an apology to\nBeethoven, a savage attack on art critics, and\na look at the family.\nMr Ustinov thinks that the critics have been\nextremely unkind to Beethoven. Although the\nmaestro is enormously appreciated by the\nworld at large, it is pointed out by Mr Ustinov\nthat the professional critics do not regard\nBeethoven as a 'real' musician! This is largely\ndue to their ignorance of the maestro's character and so in the play Mr Ustinov\nattempts to put across this omission. He is\ntrying to settle scores with the critics.\nHerr Beethoven keeps up a fair pressure\nagainst critics. He complains to Mr Fauldgate,\nwho fancies he knows more about him than he\ndoes of himself, that we tend to over-sc rut in is e and over-intellectual is e what should give us\nun self conscious joy, and on a note of\nexasperation, complains of scholars and\nhistorians who 'analyse the urine in your\nchamberpot' to 'try to find out your darkest\nsecrets'. When Mr Fauldgate gives his son's FELIX HH HB^ Hm manuscripts to Beethoven to pass judgement\non them the maestro declines, saying he has\nno right to do such a thing, and claiming a judgement of 'right' or 'wrong' is often\nun applicable. 'Zere are many truths. Each has\nits own integrity' he claims.\nHerr Beethoven is also clearly taken aback\nby the modern world in which he finds himself.\nHe eyes with incredulity tubular chairs,\nrecords and cassette players, and is appalled\nby the world of cars, traffic lights and hideously\ngarish lights 'sh pell ing out ze vor d hum burger.' The maestro spends several days in the\nhousehold, during which time he offers advice\non family matters. We also see him as an\nCordon\nBleugh\nby the Galloping Gourmand Even in a city like London where there are\nrestaurants to cater for every conceivable\nminority, it is unusual to find an establishment\nwhich deals exclusively with true Cordon\nBleugh cuisine. How refreshing, then, to find\nthe Chateau Grot in Cromwell Road (opposite\nthe Cromwellian) just in time for a post-exam\ncelebration meal.\nStarters were chosen from a list which\nincluded caviar and strawberry mousse,\nsmoked salmon sundae and melon boats\nserved with custard and grated nutmeg.\nHowever, the grilled avocado mornay is highly\nrecommended.\nIn the main courses, the versatility and\noriginality of the menu can only be compared\nwith the skill with which traditional and novel\nJune 16,1983 ^ KH M intensely religious man, but not lacking in\nmirth. The local priest comes round and is\nsurprised to see that Herr Beethoven is both a Christian and a pagan at the same time. He\nwonders how this is possible. 'Ven I am in a good mood I am a Christian. Und ven I am in a bad mood I am a pagan. Zat vay I can't blaspheme.'\nThe play is very amusing and very\ninteresting and is well worth a visit. It also\noffers a chance of witnessing Mr Ustinov on\nstage, which is a very rare thing\u2014a great pity\nsince he is such a marvellous talent.\nNick Bedding\ndishes are prepared and served. Old favourites\nlike liver meringue pie and rhubarb and kidney\ncrumble were evidently greatly enjoyed by\nother customers. A word with the wa j ter revealed some of the secrets of the house\nspeciality, Squid al 'Ancien. Mashed beetroot\nis combined in a blender with cornflower and\ncaraway seed and then simmered until thick.\nBeaten egg is added and the mixture\nrefrigerated. The squid, meanwhile, is cut into\nlong strips and deep fried in batter, and served\nwith the sauce and a generous helping of deep-fried cucumber and lettuce. The spices used to\nproduce the strangely evocative flavour\nremain a mystery.\nAn amazing selection of wines is on offer,\nincluding rare vintages from all over the world.\nOwing to the nature of the occasion, a little-known champagne, Veuve Clouseau, was\nchosen. This wine has a fragrance which will\nclear the stuffiest nose while the full-bodied\nflavour is excellent for sore throats.\nAnd so to the desserts. Old favourites like\nBlack Forest Gateau with steaming hot tomato\nsauce vie for attention with swede and mango\nsorbet. In the end I chose a portion of prawn\nand spinach cheesecake.\nCoffee was served with chocolate-coated\nafter dinner mince and the bill for two people\nleft enough change from \u00a320 to catch a taxi to\nthe nearest hospital.\n\u2022ii Mii Bii Mii iii iii iii iii it tii r11IJ i "

Mary Freeman,\nfor instance, occasionally\nannounced to all the world and\nnobody in particular that she\nwas not wearing any underwear;\nand at the Wind Band's outdoor\nChristmas concert a perfectly\ncharming female clarinettist was\nheard to pronounce the weather\nso cold that 'if I had any goo lies they would be frozen off.\nBut events have taken a much\nmore serious turn, and the\nclarinettist in question has been\nmaking salacious bargains with\none of the inmates of Linstead\nHall. His part of the deal was to\nallow her to join him while he\nwas in the bath, and perform\ncertain 'favours' for him. Alas,\nthe back-scrubbing turned to\nBack-stabbing (shades of Charlotte Corday?) when the girl\nrefused to carry out her part of\nthe deal and parade through the\ncorridors of Linstead in a flimsy\nnegligee.\nUnless she changes her mind\nsoon, we may well be seeing\nmore of the photograph below.\nBUT EVEN that tale of filth and depravity pales against an article\nsubmitted for publication in the\nAlternative Prospectus by the\nnormally staid incoming DP\nChristine Teller:\n'Eating a Mooney is like\nhaving a wank. It's all right once\nin a while,.but if you do it too\noften your knob drops off.' The\nWelfare Officer has been notified. TIME AT LAST, I suppose, to\nrelate the curious tale of Mike\nthe tall dark bespectacled\nyoungster from QEC who was\nalways looking for Martin S Taylor but never managed to\nfind him.\nBELOW\nThe story begins on May 2\nlast, when Martin, without\nwarning anyone of his intentions,\nshaved off his beard. The\nimmediate change in appearance\nwas so striking that he decided\nto enlist the help of some friends\nin completely disguising himself.\nHe dyed his hair and put on a pair of clear glass spectacles. He\npadded his mouth with lumps of\ncotton wool to change the shape\nof his face; he altered the colour\nof his lips with lip gloss. He\nchanged his customary leather\njacket, corduroy jeans and\ntrainers for a short sleeved shirt,\nripped denims and open sandals.\nAnd finally, he spent an evening\npractising different mannerisms\nand altering his voice from its\nnormal light tenor to a lisping\nbaritone. And thus Mike was\nborn.\nThe result was that early the\nfollowing afternoon Nick Pyne\nwandered in to the FELIX Office and introduced his friend\nMike Barker who was hoping to\nmeet Martin to discuss the\nprinting of QEC's magazine in\nthe ICU print unit. Martin,\ncuriously enough, wasn't there\nand so Mike, who had no\nlectures that afternoon, decided\nto wait for him in the FELIX\nOffice and chat to the rest of\nstaff while he waited.\nAll credit must be duly given\nto the Business Manager Peter\nRodgers, the Reviews Editor Lee\nPaddon, and paster-upper La\nIatrou who saw through the\ndisguise almost immediately; the\nrest of the staff were completely\ntaken in.\n^ T\"i iii iii it tii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii i11f.

Peter\nBradshaw, Professor of\nExperimental Aerodynamics at Imperial\nCollege, is renowned at\nIC as a man who never\nwalks when he can run.\nSo frantically busy is\nBradshaw that when visitors want to be shown\naround the Department\nhe hands them a floor\nplan, a cassette recorder\nand a tape containing his\nexplanatory remarks, and\nremains in his office\nwork ii is.1 Clipped from the pages of the\nNew Standard; FELIX tried to\ninterview Professor Bradshaw,\nbut he was too busy.\nMaz Fellows, the phototypesetter operator, just looked\ntotally bewildered when Martin\nin his own voice, asked her if she\nwould typeset an article for him.\nStephen Goulder wandered\ninto the office and began to\nexplain to Mike how the stapling\nmachine works\u2014he gave quite\nan interesting explanation as it\nturned out, the more so since\nnone of the FELIX staff have\never mastered it.\nPrinter Peter Dawson refused\nto believe that Mike was really\nMartin in disguise, while the\npretty and delightful Lynne\nJames later admitted that she\nhad been quite attracted to this\nstrange quiet guy who was giving\nher so much advice on pasting-up; but he dropped enormously\nin her estimation when he made\na pathetic attempt at a joke by\npretending to be the FELIX\nEditor.\n'Don't be so stupid!' she\nsnapped T know Martin Taylor\nand he's nothing like you.'\nBut the two who were fooled\nmost successfully were the\nEditor-elect, Pallab Ghosh and\nthe News Editor, Adrian James.\nPallab was introduced to Mike\nand, in Martin's absence, felt it\nhis duty to show the stranger\naround the office, explaining the\nmysteries of offset-litho and\ncamera-ready artwork in his\nusual diffident manner.

It would appear to me\nthat proving either of these\nwould be beyond the capabilities\nof even the most competent\nlawyer!\nThe reason that I am able to\noffer this advice is that a fellow\nSTOIC member (I am informed)\nentertained the notion of pur su ing a similar action against me\nlast term over a passage you\npublished in 'Below the Belt'\u2014a prospect that caused me much\namusement.

    "content": "Bond Wagon\nRolls On\nOctopussy, cert PG, starring Roger\nMoore, directed by John Glen, now\nplaying at Odeon Leicester Square.\nOnce again it is time for Ian Fleming to do one\nof his perennial rotations in his grave as\nanother of his crime thrillers gets the\nHollywood treatment. Indeed this treatment\nhas reached such a point now that the end\nproduct has little in common with the original\nplot. In the credits we find that George\nMacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and\nMichael G Wilson are responsible for the\n'screen story and screenplay' and the name of\nIan Fleming is revered and then forgotten.\nNothing wrong in all this, but it does make the\ncarping over Never Say Never Again a bit\nhypocritical. There has been a court case over\nthis rival production brought by Fleming's trustees and MGM/UA who contend that this\nis a misuse of the rights which were sold to the\nrival company, ie the rights to Thunderball.\nHowever, we can all rest a little easier with the\nknowledge that some American justices have\ntheir heads screwed on: the case was thrown\nout of court; Never Say Never Again will be\nwith us just before Christmas.\nAnyway, what about Octopussy. What is\nthere to say but that this is real vintage\nescapist stuff in The Spy Who Loved Me and\nFor Your Eyes Only mould? The gadgets, the\nchases, the spies, the murders, the double-crosses and the women. Most particularly the\nwomen\u2014there are an awful lot of them. The\nOctopussy of the title is the leader of an\nancient order of female bandits revived for the\npurposes of a spot of dirty dealing. This gives\nthe ideal excuse for Bond's natural habitat: an\nisland populated exclusively by dangerous\nwomen ready for conquering in his own\ninimitable style. There are the usual band of\nmale villi an s bent on the denial of his perfectly\nnatural conjugal rights by shooting him, knifing\nhim, sawing him in two and trying to remove\nhim from the economy class section without\nthe courtesy of a parachute. Of course these\nnumerous attempts on his life result in the\nruffling of his hair and the untimely demise of\nthe creases in his trousers, but one has to put\nup with such hardships.\nWhatever you may say about Roger Moore\n(and to his credit he has never claimed to be\nmuch of an actor) he is a superlative Bond.\nSean Connery has said that while in his Bond,\nthe humour comes out of the character, with\nMoore, the character comes out of the\nhumour. This is possibly true and probably\nunimportant, but we will have a chance to\njudge with Connery in Never Say Never\nAgain. It is difficult to say when humour\nstarted to be injected into Bond, but over the\nyears the tongue has been wedged more and\nmore firmly into the check; perhaps it may\nsoon have to be re-categorised under\nadventure-comedy a la Gene Wilder. The Man\nWith The Golden Gun marked the turning\npoint with the introduction of Jaws as the\nmanic molybdenum molar man accelerating\nthe fall. However, any genre must move with\nthe times and evolve in order to survive, rather\nlike Dr Who.\nPlaying the title role, Maud Adams, who\nplayed an ill fated role as the mobsters moll in\nMan With The Golden Gun, is fascinating and\ndeadly by degrees, but of course puts up little\ndefence to the amorous eye brow lifting Bond\nwho sweeps her off her tentacles..\nThere is also an appearance by Vijay\nAmritraj who portrays a playboy tennis-playing\ncontact, and of course we have the perennial\n'A' and 'M' without whom Bond would not be\nBond.\nThe stunts, chases and fights are well done\nand imaginative; it is difficult after so many\nBonds (fourteen so far) to invent more\nvariations on a theme but there are some\namusing twists which are well worth waiting for\nand their superb finesse and polish really\nmakes the finished product shine.\nThe bare skeleton of plot on which all the\naction hangs is somewhat thin and rather\npointless. It concerns East-West detente,\nCND, and other contemporary issues which\nreally have no place in this kind of film. In an\neffort to make the film up to date, the film\nsucceeds merely in dangerous trivial is ation. It\nmakes one long for the simple days when Bond\nmerely had to foil the dastardly plot of some\nsuper criminal bent on world domination/\ndestruction. Bring back SPECTRE and dump\nthe KGB!\nBut this is a minor blemish on an otherwise\nspotless surface\u2014plot is never paramount in\nsuch a film. Don't let this spoil you're\nenjoyment of a damn good, entertaining and\nthoroughly sexist film.\nLee Paddon\nSomething\nMissing\nThe Year of Living Dangerously, cert PG,\ndirecter Peter Weir, Plaza.\nThis is a film I had been looking forward to.\nThe pedigree looked good: Peter Weir is the\nfinest Australian director, he was responsible\nfor Picnic at Hanging Rock; Mel 'Mad Max'\nGibson, one of Australia's best actors, plays\nGuy Hamilton, a journalist\u2014and journalism is\na profession close to my heart. Unfortunately I have to admit I was disappointed; it's a film\nthat promised a lot, but in the end rather failed\nto deliver.\nIt is set in the political turmoil of Indonesia in\n1965; they have kicked out the Imperialists and\nhave gained independence, but have lost their\nscapegoat for the starvation and poverty of\nmost of the population. Civil war is brewing\nand the situation is tense.\nInto this explosive atmosphere comes Guy\nHamilton from the Sydney Herald on his first\nassignment as a foreign correspondent. He is\nambitious and sees this as his big break, if he\nblows it he'll be back on the city desk for ever.\nAfter a shaky start he becomes a member of\nthe ex-patria te set and manages to as simulate something of the plight and background of the\npeople of the country as seen through the eyes\nof a natives (Linda Hunt) who decides to adopt\nGuy and be his photographer.\nThe obligatory love interest in supplied in\nthe shapely form of Sigourney Weaver who\nplays a British Embassy attac he, Jill Bryant.\nThe last time we saw Miss Weaver she was\nbattling against unwelcome extra terrestrial\nhitchhikers in Alien; this time she has the odd\nugly confrontation with rather more human\nbut equally deadly inhabitants of Jakarta. This\nis however a far better role for her as this time\nshe does more than push buttons, ask dumb\nquestions and scream a lot, but her American\naccent was a bit off putting; possibly Aussies\ncan't tell the difference.\nAlthough I found the film as a whole a little\ndisappointing, there are some fine performances: Guy Hamilton stands out. He\ndevelops from an idealistic journalist daunted\nby the responsibility of his job to a reckless\ndaredevil of limitless ambition. Linda Hunt\nplays his native photographer who is saddened\nby the change in Guy and the plight of the\npeople of the country\u2014a nicely downbeat\ntragic role. There are some well made scenes\nof angry crowds on the march and the tension vj\nand tautness of the camera work is rem in r^j scent of Costa Guervers' Missing. All .the\ncomponents are there, but for some reason\nthe total is less than the sum of the parts\u2014the\nfeel is wrong.\nStill, not a bad film by any means and one\nI'm sure will consolidate Peter Weir's high\nreputation and do the Australian film industry\nnothing but good.\nLee Paddon\nFELIXI [June 16,1983 Page 21\n\n"

He\ncautiously negotiated the steps\nand knocked gently on the door,\nwhich is out of sight, but within\nearshot of the main office.\nThe door was briskly opened.\n'Mike!' exclaimed Martin in his\nown voice 'come in!'.\nThe door was closed again,\nand sounds of muffled conversation issued forth for about five\nminutes, and then came the\nsounds of the door opening once\nmore.\n'See you again then,' said\nMartin, 'and do get in touch if\nyou want that printing done.'\nMike climbed down the stairs\nand faced the rest of the office\nwith an embarrassed smile. 'He\nwas upstairs all the time,' he\nlisped.\nAdrian, who was by now quite\nannoyed with Martin, stormed\nupstairs and burst into the\nEditor's empty office returning a few seconds later completely\nbaffled to find the rest of the\nstaff\u2014and Martin\u2014helpless\nwith laughter.\nUNION POLICY is that sexual\nintercourse is forbidden in the\nUnion Building except when\n'discreet and unavoidable'.\nLeaving aside the question of\nhow it can ever be totally\nunavoidable ('she was lying\nthere with her legs apart, m 'lud,\nand as I walked towards her I tripped over the rug') I am\npleased to relate that at least one\ncouple have coupled discreetly\nand unavoidably in one of the\nUnion rooms.\nConsiderable pressure has\nbeen put on me to reveal their\nnames, but since they were most\ndiscreet, and since their deed was\nunavoidable at least in the sense\nthat they had nowhere else to go,\nI shall keep silent.\nNevertheless, I think it should\nbe recorded that there are people\nmaking use of this, one of the\nless obvious facilities provided\nby the Union.\n\u2022 Boring SEE CIVIL ENGINEERS\nfrom the Yellow Pages\nAND SO, at last, inevitably,\nsince this is the last of these\ncolumns I shall write, here are a FEU XH HH HH HH1 handful of stories from the very\ntop.\nThe first concerns Lady Mary,\nthe garrulous and delightfully\ns catty first lady of IC who\nalways likes to leave the impression that, however great her\nhusband's importance outside\n170 Queensgate, there is no\ndoubt who is in charge at home.\nOn this particular occasion,\nshe excused herself from a formal gathering, explaining\nthat she had to get home to\nmake the beds for some guests\nshe was expecting. Someone\njokingly suggested that Brian\nought to offer to help\u2014at least,\nit was intended as a joke, but\nLady Mary took it quite serious-iy-'Dear me no,' she replied. 'He\nhasn't time to make the beds\u2014\nhe's still got the washing up to\ndo.'\nYET IT'S a great pity that Lord\nFlowers has acquired this image\nof being so dull, for beneath his\nlugubrious exterior there is\nan undoubtedly brilliant mind.\nIt has also been widely rumoured that he was once a young man with an undergraduate sense of humour, like\nmany of us, and I am happy to\nbe able to offer two tales\nconfirming this.\nThe first concerns an occasion\nwhen, as a Cambridge under-graduate, he gained access to\nNewnham College, one of the\ntwo girls' colleges, and actually\ntook a bath there. Considering\nthe way students behave in\nLinstead these days, this may\nnot sound like much, but in that\nage this was a fearful and daring\nthing to do. Before you were\nallowed to visit a girl in her\nroom, her bed had to be carried\ninto the corridor; to be caught\ntaking a bath would certainly\nhave incurred the wrath of one's tutor, if not the dean himself.\nOne might as well try to take a bath in a Hall Warden's flat or\neven 170 Queensgate.\nThe second story concerns\nan independent contemporary of\nour future Rector who was the\nsubject of much cruel humour in\nthat he had trouble with his\nbladder, and this occasioned him\nto use the lavatory several times\na night. This character (who had\na highly appropriate name which\nI have inexcusably forgotten\u2014\nsomething like Piddlewick)\nregularly disturbed the sleep of\nthe undergraduates on his\nstaircase as he tramped the\nhundred yards or so to the\nnearest loo. So it came as a great\nrelief to all parties when he\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 June16, equipped his room with a chamber pot.\nUnfortunately, this only\nreinforced the jokes against him,\nand when the receptacle was\nnext left unguarded, the youthful\nBrian took the opportunity of\ndoctoring it with certain chemicals. That night a vigil was maintained outside Piddlewick's room, and a couple of hours\nafter he had retired the listeners\nwere rewarded. First came the\nclump of a pair of feet hitting the\nfloor and walking across the\nroom, and then the sound of a cascade of liquid hitting earth-en ware. Finally there were\nsqueals of disbelief as the\nreaction in the pot produced a fluid that was strongly phosphorescent. What I now ask is how anyone\ncan feel animosity towards a Rector who has shown such\nimagination in his humour.\nJOHN McCALLION, ICU's saintly Deputy President, has\nbeen attacking RCSU pretty\nviciously of late, so I thought I'd include a little story to show they\naren't quite as black as they're\npainted.\nLast year, you may remember,\nGuilds had a lot of trouble when\ntheir annual magazine Spanner\nwas mislaid. They phoned the\nprinters, who assured them it\nhad been delivered to Imperial,\nbut it wasn't until several days\nhad passed that they discovered\nevery single copy had found its\nway into the RCSU Office.\nGuilds never discovered how\nthis came about, but I am now in\na position to tell them.\nThe printers, knowing nothing\nof IC's tradition of kleptomania\nunwisely left them all in the\nSummer Accommodation Centre\nwhere a wily undergraduate\nmathematician, deciding it\nmight be fun to ransom them,\nphoned the RCS President and\nsuggested he steal them.\nAnd who do you suppose that\nmathematician could have been?\nWhy, none other than your\nfriend and mine, Mr JJ McCallion.\nONE FINAL snippet from the\nboss: the reason the President's annual two thousand word\nreport was submitted late was\nthat after it was written Stephen\nmanaged to lose it. He spent well\nover two hours looking for it\nbefore it turned up in his wastepaper basket where someone\nhad thrown it, he says, by\nmistake.\nTHOSE OF YOU who were here\ntwo years ago will remember\nSteve Marshall's expose of\nfreemasonry, which is rife at IC.\nIt has come to my attention\nthat a prominent figure in the\nUnion has been elected to the IC\nLodge, and will be undergoing\ninitiation this Saturday evening,\ndressed in the appropriate\nmanner as modelled by Mr Marshall in the photograph.\nWhile I couldn't possibly\nbring myself to name this f efl pw,I realise many of you are bound\nto be curious as to his identity,\nand so, somewhere subtly\nhidden in this week's FELIX, I have included the slightest\npossible indication of who the .\nnew recruit might be.\nTHE UNION STAFF had quite\na surprise during the last\nvacation when a letter arrived\naddressed to one of the officers\n\u2022 of the Transcendental Meditation Society. The Union always\nopen letters which arrive during\nthe holidays, in case they contain\nurgent bills or other business; in\nthis case they contained tickets\nfor a Transcendental Meditation\nconference which had been\nordered some weeks previously.\nThe title of the conference,\nwhich the Union staff couldn't help but notice was Transcendental Meditation and its use in\nincreasing sexual drive and\npotency.\n19831 I Page 1\n1\n\n"

The offical\nreason for this regulation is to be\nfair to married couples, but since\na married couple receive considerably less benefit than two\nsingle people it is easy to see\nanother reason for the persistence with which this regulation is followed up. If you are\nclassified as co-ha biting the\nwoman loses her eligibility to\nclaim in her own right and the\nman has to claim for her as a dependent. To avoid being\nclassed as a couple you will have\nto prove that the two of you live\ntotally independently as regards\nrent and other bills, and you will\nusually need to prove you have\nyour own rooms. If you feel you\nhave been unjustly classified\nthen appeal (see below).\nAppeals: If you feel your\nbenefit has been incorrectly or\nunfairly assessed don't be afraid\nto appeal. Both the DHSS and\nthe local housing authority have\nconsiderable discretionary\npowers when deciding your\nbenefit and it is your right to\nchallenge their discretion. With\nboth supplementary and housing\nbenefit you have the right to a full written breakdown of the\nway in which your benefit was\nassessed, together with the right\nto appeal to a supplementary\nbenefit tribunal or local authority review board whichever is\nappropriate. However, delay in\nasking for a review could cause\nyou to lose your right to appeal.\nSo if you are unsure about your\nbenefit write to the relevant\nauthority as early as possible\nasking for a full breakdown and\nindicating your intention to\nappeal if necessary. If you want\nto know more about the appeals\nprocedure, Student Services can\ngive you an outline of what\nhappens and represent you at a tribunal or review board if you\nso wish.\nA final note: if you are\nunemployed over the summer\nyou should be able to get some\nbenefits providing you follow\nthe rules. However if you do\nhave problems with your claim\ncall into the Student Services\nOffice or give us a ring on 589\n5111 ext 2033 and we should be\nable to help sort things out.\nKaren Stott\nStudent Services\nMost of you will hopefully have\nseen the article in FELIX last\nterm concerning the House of\nLords judgement in December\n1982 regarding overseas students,\nlocal education authority awards\nand, in particular, the definition\nof the term 'ordinary residence'.\nFor those who missed that\narticle here is a brief resume.\nVarious education acts from\n1962 onwards have placed a duty\non local education authorities\n(LEAs) to bestow mandatory\nawards in respect of attendance\nat first degree courses on anyone\n'ordinarily resident' ip the UK\nfor the three years preceeding the\nstart of the course in question\n(subject to certain exceptions).\nThese regulations made no\nmention of the applicant's place\nof origin, domicile or nationality,\nand no hint was given to the\nintended meaning of 'ordinarily\nresident' although most authorities followed the advice offered\nby the Department of Education\nand Science in circular A CL1/78 namely applying what is\nknown as the 'real home' test to\napplicants. Under this test\npersons in the UK solely or\nmainly for educational purposes\nduring the three years preceeding\ntheir degree course were not\ndeemed to be 'ordinarily resident'\nand many grants were refused on\nthese grounds.\nIn December 1982 five of\nthese cases appeared before the\nHouse of Lords for their judgement on the matter. The Lords\nrejected the 'real home' test as\ninappropriate and ruled that the\nterm 'ordinarily resident' should\nbe given its natural and ordinary\nmeaning, ie 'has the applicant\nshown that he has habitually and\nnormally resided in the UK from\nchoice and for a settled purpose\nthroughout the prescribed\nperiod, apart from temporary or\noccasional absences' (Lord\nScarman). In addition the Lords\nruled that education could be\ncounted as a settled purpose\nthereby opening the doors for\nmany students who had previously been rejected by LEAs\non the grounds of 'ordinary\nresidence' to re-apply.\nFor the next few months most\nLEAs, besieged by re applicants. refused to make any moves until\npromised guidance appeared\nfrom the DES. Now at last new\nhope has dawned in the form of\nDES circular A CL2/83 distributed to LEAs on March 30\n1983. Although DES circulars\nare not binding on LEAs it is\nlikely that most LEAs will\ninterpret the Lords judgement\naccording to the DES guidelines.\nThe major part of these guidelines are reproduced here.\nThe circular issues guidelines\non which cases should be eligible\nfor reconsideration:\n'It is...for authorities to decide\nwhether or not to reopen cases in\nwhich they think, in the light of\nthe House of Lords judgement,\nthey may have wrongly refused a student a mandatory award by\napplying an incorrect test of\nordinary residence'.\nTn the Secretary of State's view...LEAs should be prepared\nin principle to reconsider cases\nwhere the refusal of an award\nwas in respect of a course\nbeginning in the academic year\n1979/80 or later, but save in\nexceptional circumstances they\nshould not reconsider a refusal\nof an award made earlier than\nthat.'\nBut it also makes restrictions:\n'The duty of a local education\nauthority to bestow an award is\nsubject to the condition that the\nstudent has made an application\nfor an award in writing before\nthe end of the term in which he\ncommences his course. If no\nsuch application has been made\nthe question of review of a refusal to grant an award does\nnot arise. If the LEA has no\nrecord of having received such\nan application, it will normally\nbe for the student to satisfy the\nLEA that he did in fact make\none.'\n'LEAs may receive representations from students who\ndid not apply for an award for a course they are now following\nbecause they mistakenly thought\nthemselves ineligible. There is no\nreason in law why authorities\nshould entertain such representations but allowance of a late application is at the LEA's discretion.'\nIn addition the circular\nsuggests that LEAs should\nrequire written representations\nfor the reconsideration of each\ncase to be made to the appropriate LEA by July 31 1983.\nIn short, any student who\nbegan their undergraduate\ncourse on or after October 1979\nand who had been 'ordinarily\nresident' in the UK for at least\nthree years preceeding the start of\ntheir course whether or not this\nwas in full-time education,\nshould be eligible for a mandatory award for their undergraduate course providing they\nmade an application in writing\nto their LEA for such an award\nbefore the end of the first term of\ntheir course and providing they\nwrite to the same LEA asking\nfor their case to be reconsidered\nbefore July 31 1983.\nAny student who fails to fulfil\neither of these provisions is\nlikely to have a tough battle\ngetting an award but do put in\nan application and if you feel\nyou have a strong case, call into\nStudent Services and we'll see if\nwe can help. Student Services are\ntrying to make a survey of the\nsuccess of re-applicants so if you\nhave made, or are going to\nmake, an application for an\naward please let Student Services\nknow as this issue is of national\ninterest.\nClearly the Lords decision was\nunpopular at the DES and\nsolicitors there spent many\ntroubled hours perusing ways\naround the judgement. Although\nthey have now accepted the\nrights of re-applicants to retrospective awards, the addition of\na short paragraph to the regulations, effective from March 31\n1983, has ensured that in future\nperiods spent in the UK wholly\nor mainly for the purpose of\nreceiving full-time education will\nnot count towards the three year\n'ordinary residence' requirements for mandatory awards.\nThis new provision applies to all\napplications to awards for\ncourses beginning in the academic years 1982/3 and 1983/4\nwhich LEAs have not yet\ndecided.\nFees\nNew regulations are soon to be\nplaced before Parliament concerning the future classification\nof students as overseas for fees\npurposes. In the meantime the\nCollege are still awaiting guidance from the DES regarding the\nclassification for fees purposes\nof students who are currently\nstudying at, or have recently left,\nImperial.\nKaren Stott\nStudent Services\nPage16 June 16,1983 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Review of\nthe Year\nAs always a review of the\nsporting year at IC is a very\npleasant thing to write. A pleasing aspect of the season\ngone by is that whilst established\nclubs have performed well, other\nlesser known clubs have improved and scored some notable\nvictories.\nThe Football Club had a very\ngood season this year. They\ncaptured the UL U Cup in a match that, as in all great\nmatches, went to a replay.\nAdmittedly their league showing\nwas not as good. The important\nquestion to ask is what will\nhappen when Rickard leaves\nCollege. Who can provide the\nof over 200. The first team did\nwell to come second in the first\ndivision but some of the lower\nteams were struggling to avoid\nrelegation. A tour was undertaken to Paderborn in Germany\nwhich proved to be very success-ful. Incidentally anyone wanting\nto read the full story of this tour\ncan collect the 115 page 'novel'\nfrom the FELIX Office.\nFor the first time this year the\nTennis Club competed in a winter league and performed\ncreditably.\nThe martial arts clubs are a growing area of sport at IC. The\nJudo Club is probably the most\nestablished of these and last year\ngoals he has been scoring for the\nlast six years.\nThe Rugby Club could not\nrepeat the previous year's success of winning the Gutteridge\nCup. They went out in the first\nround to the team they beat in\nthe final last year. To make up\nfor this they won the plate\ncompetition. A successful tour\nwas also completed although\nrumours abound about what\nwent on off the field!\nThe Hockey Club had numerous successes including their first\nsnow-bound hockey festival in\nFolkestone!! Moving away from\nfield sports probably the most\nsuccessful club was the Badminton Club who, inspired by\ntheir captain, won four leagues\nand the UL U Knockout Cup.\nThey also entertained a team\nfrom Trinity College Dublin\u2014\nentertained being the right word.\nStaying with racquet clubs the\nSquash Club expanded almost to\nbursting point with membership\nPage 24 WkWkWkWkWKkWkW\nthey had their best season yet.\nThey won the Men'sULU Championship and were second\nin the women's. One of their\nmembers, Keith Stevenson,\nachieved the accolade of 1st Dan (black belt) and many\nothers increased their grading.\nThis success was carried on by\nthe Karate Club who performed\nwell in the Southern Area\nChampionships at Poole\u2014\nwinning one of the ladies events.\nAgain many people increased\ntheir grading. The newest\nmartial arts club is the Wing\nChun Club and unfortunately\ninterest has dwindled in this\nclub\u2014perhaps we can hope for a resurgence next year.\nMoving along to the water\nsport clubs. Boat Club again\nperformed well although their\nbiggest event\u2014Henley\u2014is still\nto come. Sailing Club improved\ntheir position in the Southern\nUniversities league. Unfortunately they lost one of the\nCastaways Cups but due to a stroke of good luck a spare\ntrophy appeared in the Union\nOffice\u2014any ideas what to do\nwith it? Their best result of the\nyear was coming second in an\ninternational tournament in\nTilbury, Holland.\nOther clubs that have performed well are the Volleyball\nClub, who despite low membership managed to win their league\nfor the second year running. A tour abroad is also on the cards\nfor the club where no doubt they\nwill smash everyone in sight. The\nRifle Pistol Club are second in\nvarious leagues. The Fencing\nClub did well against other\ntea irt s and interest in the club\nlikes maintained throughout the\nyear.\nThe club which deserves a special mention is the Cycling Club\nunder the strong, decisive and\ndetermined leadership of Ronan.\nDespite some scepticism on the\npart of ACC the Cycling Club\nhave recently had some exceptional results for a new club. The\nbest of these came in winning the\nteam prize in the BSSF 50 mile\ntime trial championship.\nGreat fun was had at Sports\nDay this year although it was\npoorly attended. The event\nshowed great potential for the\nfuture. The events were mainly\ndominated by two people\u2014John\nLee and Mike Jones\u2014but I think it is fair to say that\neveryone who took part enjoyed\nthemselves. Hopefelly this will\nbe better attended next year.\nI think a bit must be said\nemphasising the importance of\nsport at IC. The majority of\npeople at IC are a member of a sports club and so money given\nto sporting purposes is well\ndistributed throughout the\nCollege.\nIn more general terms last\nyear has had many important\nimplications for sport at IC. For\ninstance the approve ment of the\nUune 16,19831 I FELIX\n\n"

And so the die was\ncast\u2014it wasn't until some twenty\nyears later that his natural flair for\ndealing with numbers surfaced, as\ndid Martin with a first class\nhonours degree, a chaste and\nscholarly figure.

    "content": "\" A RL WAR J TRETURN\nOF\nTHE\njEDI\nFor many people the release of Return of the\nJedi (U, Richard Marquand), the third film in\nthe continuing Star Wars saga, is the movie\nevent of the year.\nEven before production started, this film\nwas virtually guaranteed substantial commercial success\u2014but I'm pleased to say that\nGeorge Lucas and co haven't rested on their\nlaurels. Indeed, they have produced another\nvirtuoso space-opera that is certain to delight\n\"Star Wars devotees (myself included) and, at\nthe very least, provide a few hours of harmless\nfun for the hardened cynics of this world.\nFollowing the briefest of Flash Gordon style\nresumes we are plunged straight into the\naction once more. A new and more powerful\ndeath star\u2014a massive space battle station\u2014\nhangs partially complete over the forest moon\nof Endor. The Galactic Emperor himself is to\nsupervise final construction and is greeted by\nDarth Vader, his evil major do mo and general\nbad guy.\nBut first, despite the mortal danger which\nfaces the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker (nice\nguy and last of a breed of noble galactic\nknights, the Jedi) must rescue his old chum\nHan Solo (hunk y space pirate) from the\nclutches of the vile Jabba the Hutt.\nBefore I have another attack of the\nbrackets, I had better pause here to marvel at\nthe delights of the Jabba's abode, where a large slice of the film takes place. For this\nscene an alarming array of alien creatures has\nbeen created, who hold the voyeuristic appeal\nof an outrageous freak show. Jabba himself is\nan overweight, slug-like creature with\nenormous eyes and an inexplicable, if\nconvenient, taste for pretty dancing girls. The\nconvincing realisation of this ghastly monster,\ncomplete with mafia mentality and splendid\ndeep voice, is one of the major successes of\nthe film.\nAnyway, after a well paced but overcomplicated rescue, it's back to the old familiar\ngame of blow-up-the-death-star. This entails\ndisabling a powerful force field projected\naround said battle station from Endor, and this\nallows plenty of daring chases (notably a stunning jet-bike sequence) and cliff hanging rescues in a plush forest location.\nMeanwhile, Luke Skywalker has once more\nbeen tipped the wink by Yoda and a ghostly\nObi Wan Kenobi (played with increasingly\nobvious embarrassment by Alec Guiness) vis a vis his immediate relations. He rushes off to\nconfront dastardly Darth Vader (who, as you\nmay or may not know, was revealed as Luke's pater in episode two) and is brought before the\nEmperor for conversion to the dark side of the\nall powerful Force. Cue final confrontation.\nWell, as you can see, the Force is cert ian ly continued with a rollicking, no-holds-barred\naction adventure. It would be all too easy to\ncriticise the acting and story, but you must\nbear in mind the overall concept of the\nsaga\u2014it is, and should remain, an unashamedly\nnaive and accessible fairy tale. Images of jack-booted nas ties and t it i latin g princesses are\nmixed with magic and mysticism in liberal, but\nexact, doses. Achieving the right balance here\nis as skilled a task as creating the highest form\nof art film, with the added dangers of overindulgence and disappointing devoted\nOverall, I felt that Jedi was only partially\nsuccessful. The special effects have been let\nloose to a frightening degree, but are brilliantly\naccomplished by a team of fine craftsmen.\nHowever, the overcrowded action occasionally\nbecomes confusing (as in a battle of space\nfleets involving hundreds of ships) which does\nAll for one--Han Solo (Harrison Ford),\nPrincess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke.\nSkywalker (Mark Hammill) busy saving the\ntend to blunt the spectacle a little.\nIan McDiarmid gives a splendid performance\nas the Emperor, mixing pantomime caricature\nwith malevolent zeal, and even eclipses the\nrole of Darth Vader as Mr Bad. It is a pity that\nother characters are wasted however \u2014\nnotably Boba Felt, the mercenary, who is\nquickly killed-off, along with a few other\nsurprises (in what was presumably a deliberate\ntrimming of numbers in this concluding\nepisode of a trilogy).\nThe most daring and, to my mind,\nsuccessful introduction is the Ewok race, a band of gritty teddy bears who help the Rebels\non Endor. This whole idea could have failed\nabysmally and brought the film crashing with\nit, but once more George Lucas demonstrates\nhis gift for entertaining without insulting the\nintelligence 'of his audience. The Ewoks are\ngenuinely convincing, even though they look\nlike furry midgets, and I'm amazed that the film\nmakers managed to pull this particular idea off\nat all.\nSo, there is no doubt that Return of the Jedi\nis more-of-the-same and better for those who\nhave enjoyed the previous two films. It ties up\nmany loose ends to varying degrees of\nsatisfaction (oh yes, I have avoided revealing\nseveral major revelations in the plot!) and has a satisfying up-beat ending itself. And judging by\nthe way it is already smashing box office\nrecords (yes, even those of ET) both here and\nin America, I hardly feel I need recommend it\nanyway.\nSo, until the next episode, may the Force be\nwith you.\nMark Smith\nLuke Skywalker and Chewbacca hanging around on Endor.\nPage 20 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ^ \u2022 ^ ^ \u2022 ^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 M June 16,19831 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "IOPINIONI\nAs the mantle of presidential impartiality slips from his shoulders\nGOULDER BLASTS RCSU\nIn my first few days at Imperial\nCollege the nature of the CCUs\nwas attacked by the then SCC\nChairman Dr Frank James. In a series of provocative statements\nhe labelled them as anti-intellectual beer swilling louts\nparticipating in essentially tribal\ntraditions. This view was debated\nextensively and was not without\nsupport in the letters column of\nFELIX. However, in bracketing\nthe CCUs together Dr James\nmade his principal mistake.\nWhereas RSMU and C& GU continue to provide abroad based and valuable service to their\nmembers, RCSU has sunk to a pitiable level. It is not without\nsome regret that I say this because\nI did take part in RCSU activities\nover two of my three undergraduate years and I have now\nbegun to get involved with the\nRCSA.\nIt is the events of this year that\nhave confirmed that RCSU has\nfailed to merit any significant\nstatus within IC. In membership\nit has become a rump of self\nindulgent, self deluding individuals who seek to perpetuate a set\nof traditions whose origins have\nbeen lost in the mists of 1960s antiquity. They do little to cater\nfor the majority of their ordinary\nmembers\u2014can there be any\ngreater disincentive to attending\na formal dinner than for somebody to vomit the contents of his\nstomach over the table after\nmaking an attempt to finish the\nthree handled pot? Their much\nvaunted academic societies\ncould be better handled within\nICU, certainly many of the\nproblems that arose with Biochem Soc would not have arisen\nhad it been monitored by ICU.\nMascotry has become institutional is ed vandalism in the\nhands of RCSU. It has descended\nto breaking and entering in its\nattempts to obtain mascots. In\nits recent actions concerning the\nblatant misuse of an ICU van the\nofficer concerned revealed the\nmoral corruption that has\nbecome typical of RCSU'mascot ry. Can it then come as any\nsurprise when this ambivalence\nto vandalism leads to yet\nanother year when Silwood Park\nstaff were left to clear up after\n-the May Ball? Professor Way\nhad no alternative but to end the\nSilwood Ball after several years\nof warnings had gone unheeded.\nIn my annual report, discussed\nat the ICU AGM, the main\nFELIX Hn HH concern of the RCSU contingent\npresent was not Residence,\nRefectory or Academic policy\nbut their right to throw rotting\nfish after Morphy Day. This\nillustrates their laughable set of\npriorities and their absurd idea\nof what really matters in IC.\nBut perhaps* it is in their\ndealings with ICU that RCSU\nhas demonstrated the depths of\nits moral bankruptcy and\ninternal decay. The way certain\nofficers of RCSU misled the\nUFC over the size of their\ndeposit account can only be\nexplained as a deliberate lie. In\norder to obtain an ICU van for\nmascot ry, the incident I mentioned previously, an RCSU\nofficer virtually lied to a member\nof permanent staff. I found it\nastonishing that the person\ninvolved objected to ICU disciplining him for this breach of\ntrust.\nThere was one event that\ncould be said to be the apotheosis of what RCSU has become:\ntheir AGM. The initiation rites\nwere almost aboriginal in their\ntribal emphasis. Firstly the\nofficers were humiliated by\nbeing covered in waste refuse\nand then raised to officer status\nby the application of 'war paint'. There were also the 'traditions'\nformulated in modern times\ntypified by the consumption of\ncurdled milk and beer. Even\nsuch a ridiculous tradition was\nstrong enough to prevent any\nnew officer of RCSU breaking it.\nAt the end of the meeting they\nperformed the Kangala which\ndid not sound like the proud\nchant I remember but more like\nan ob s cui e unintelligible nursery\nrhyme.\nPerhaps it is worth discussing\nhow RCSU have reached such a nadir in such a relatively short\ntime. It may well be that it is\npredominantly a question of\nstyle that is involved. Possibly in\nprevious years there were\nofficers who had the strength of\ncharacter to be able to fulfil a role that appealed to a broad\ncross section . It is very noticeable that there are virtually no\npostgraduates involved in\nRCSU, indeed one of RCSU's complaints to me is that there\nwill be no person active in RCSU\nwho will be over 21 next year\nand therefore old enough to hire\nan ICU van. In the last few years\nsuccessive RCSU Presidents\nhave surrendered the middle\nground and have allowed their\nappeal to be to a minority even\namong those whom Dr James\nwould label as 'beer swilling\nlouts'.\nThat this has happened to a body founded in 1891 with TH Huxley as its first President is a great tragedy. It retains a status\nat Imperial College of which its\nactions continue to demonstrate\nthat it is not worthy. Indeed\nwithin the constitution of ICU,\nRCSU as one of the CCUs, has\nconsiderable influence through\nthe executive that is effectively\ndenied to other branches of ICU.\nPerhaps the time has come for\nthat influence to be not a right\nbut a privilege through an\nelection from Council.\nThe only remedy that will haul\nRCSU out of the abyss is to\nmake it aware that it will have to\ntake full and direct responsibility\nfor its actions. As far as this is in\nmy power to do I fully intend to\ndo so. The process has begun\nthrough the cessation of the\nSilwood Ball, the punitive action\nagainst Mr Fuller and through a close scrutiny of the R CSU estimates. They must not be\njudged on their illustrious past\nbut on what they do now.\nIn many respects the individuals now involved in RCSU are\nlike monkeys scampering over\nthe ruins of a once great civil is a tion. In particular Mr Charles\nFuller seems, like Custer, to\nbe leading RCSU to a singularly\navoidable massacre.\nThe end of RCSU will not be\nan act of dissolution but something far worse\u2014The Union will\nirrelevant, unnecessary and\nfinally unsupported.\nCromwellian\nEntrance on:\n3 Cromwell Road, SW7.\nTel: 584 7258\n(Opposite Natural History Museum)\nCOCKTAIL BAR\nL=3 Open\nMon-Fri 6.00-11.00\nSat 8.00-11.00\nHappy Hour\n6.00-9.00\nCocktails \u00a31.50\nMonday Special\nCocktails \u00a31.50\nall night\nNIGHTCLUB\nI1 Open\nTues-Sat\n11.00-3am Party Night\nWesnesday\nDrinks 9 0 p Cocktails \u00a31.50\nall night\nSUMMER OFFER\nEntrance to Night Club half price on\npresentation of Imperial College cards\nUune 16,19831 I Page5\n\n"

    "content": "UP UP AND AWAY IN THIS SPECIAL In one of my first editorials, I mentioned that I was interested in\nfeature articles for FELIX, and if\nany club was interested in taking\non a new member for an after-noon, I'd be happy to write about\nit afterwards. I didn't really expect\nmuch of a response, but it seemed\na worthwhile gamble to attract\nsome feature material and (with\nluck) pick up a few freebies\nalong the way.\nTwo people replied. The first was a man who\nis trying to set up a parachute club at IC, and\nhe suggested I should jump out of ai aeroplane\nat 2,000 feet. This sounded more than a little\nterrifying\u2014and was; with Pallab's permission I shall be telling you about it next term.\nThe second reply didn't arrive till the\nbeginning of this term. Colin Butter,\nRecreational Clubs Committee Chairman and\nPresident of IC's Balloon Club suggested that\nthe club could do with some publicity and\nwould I like a trip in a balloon so that I could\nwrite about it in FELIX afterwards? The\nproblem in interesting people in ballooning, he\nexplained, is that it is almost exclusively a summer sport. Consequently it's next to\nimpossible to generate enthusiasm at the\nOctober Freshers' Fair, and come the summer\nmany people are already entrenched in other\nclubs (to say nothing of exams).\nAll of which goes to explain how I found\nmyself just outside Harrogate in a place called\nPannal, which appeared to be one of those\nminute villages which consist exclusively of a railway station and a pub. (Actually Pannal has\nthe distinction of compressing itself even\nfurther, since the pub is a metamorphosed\nrailway station and is served only by\npay trains.) Colin picked me up in the minibus and I was\nwhisked away to a camping site where a large\ncrowd consisting mainly of middle-aged\nTo avoid nearby airfields it is important to\nhave a competent navigator on board.\ncouples dressed in old flannel trousers and\nbaggy pullovers had emerged from expensive\nand comfortable-looking trailer tents and were\nstudiously focusing long telephoto lenses on\nthe hive of balloonists before them. We skirted\nthe crowd and I got my first chance to see a hot-air balloon close up.\nIn retrospect, all the things which surprised\nme about ballooning were quite obvious, and if\nI had taken the time to think about them\nbeforehand really shouldn't have surprised me\nat all. It doesn't take much intelligence to\nrealise that cold air isn't that much denser than\nhot air, and so to lift three people, a basket and\nthree cylinders of propane a balloon has got to\nbe big. Nevertheless I was still taken aback by\nthe size of what looked like vast circular\nmarquees laid out on the grass.\nRather than fill the balloon with hot air\ndirectly, they are filled with cold air first which\nis then heated, and to this end some of the\nteam started a large petrol-driven fan which\nblew a force eight gale into the mouth of the\nballoon. Slowly the flaccid worm on the ground\nbegan to fill out, and soon the distinctive\nballoon shape appeared.\nWhen there was enough air in the balloon\nfor its mouth to stay open, the burners were lit.\nIC's balloon has two burners, each about nine\ninches in diameter, which direct a jet of flame\nseveral feet long into the balloon. My second\nobvious surprise came when it was pointed out\nthat the hotter the air, the more lift you get; the\nair in a modern hot-air balloon has to reach a minimum of 85\u00b0C before a flight is possible.\nThe balloon was now inflated, but still lying\non its side. As we waited for the air to heat up\nenough to pull it vertical Colin introduced me\nto the rest of the crew: Gill, his wife, who was\nto be our navigator, and Andy who was to pilot\nthe balloon. Most of the baskets I could see\nheld four people, but ours had a three-man\nbasket, so I was the only free-loader.\nSeveral other balloons were already taking\noff, so I occupied my last few minutes on the\nground by photographing them as they went.\nFinally Colin signalled to me that our balloon\nwas almost ready. I ran over to the basket\nwhere I was handed a thin off-white jerkin with\nthe British Oxygen motif. I was a little puzzled\nby this, but did as I was bidden and put it on\nover my own anorak. Colin deliberately didn't explain its purpose until I was just about to\nclimb aboard, and then his explanation\nconsisted of just two words: 'It's fireproof.\nClimbing into a wicker basket in a hurry is\neasier said than done. There is very little grip\nfor your feet, and it doesn't help that you are\nwearing walking boots or well ies. But\nsomehow I managed to get inside (the right\nway up) and said my goodbyes and was wished\na good flight by the ground crew. When the\nballoon went up it was important that it rose fairly\nquickly at first, to clear trees and power cables\nand so as many people as possible were\ngathered to hold us down while Andy gave the\nTo get the air in a balloon hot enough to lift it f at the rate of over a pound a minute.\nburners a final blast. Then, quite un dramatically, we were free of the ground and balloon\nand cargo\u2014two and a half tons in mass but still\nlighter than air\u2014rose majestically into the\natmosphere. ^ -One thing my parachute jump had prepared\nme for was the cold. The further you rise, the\ncolder it becomes and a fresh breeze can only\nmake things worse; consequently I was well\ninsulated, with plenty of warm layers under my\nanorak and asbestos jerkin. What I had\nforgotten, of course, was that firstly the\nballoon drifts with the wind, so the relative\nairspeed is zero, and secondly you are\nA \"it\nII\nThey aren't all balloon shaped!\nFEATURE ARTICLE ie ground,the massive burners need to burn propane\nstanding only a few feet from two of the largest\npropane burners you have seen in your life.\nCold was not a problem.\nThe other surprise was the noise. I had\nalways visualise d balloons as totally peaceful\u2014\nthe one absolutely silent means of transport.\nThis illusion was also shattered as the\nburners, when they are used, make such a roar that conversation is only possible with\ndifficulty.\nBut the view was every bit as spectacular as\none could wish for. Even though we were only\nflying at about fifty feet, the constantly\nchanging panorama is perfectly magical. All\nthe farms and villages of the Yorkshire\ncountryside are spread out below you, as\nadults point, children wave, and herds of cows\nstare in sheer disbelief as you glide effortlessly\nover them.\nThe ballooning fraternity is quite small\u2014\nthere are only about 300 qualified pilots in the\ncountry\u2014and Andy was able to tell me about\nj the other balloons we could see, and the\n'astonishing diversity of their pilots, whose\nranks include a top doctor, a pig farmer, and a professional balloonist.\nThere is also considerable mystique\nattached to the naming of balloons: Hot'n 'Cold\nwas pointed out to me, as was Shadowfax II\nand the disgustingly named Meconium which\nyou can look up in a dictionary like I did. IC's balloon is called Passing Wind.\nThere is no way to steer a hot air balloon,\nand your direction is determined entirely by\nthe wind. The only possibility of altering course\nis when the wind is blowing in different\ndirections at different levels, for you can\ncontrol the height of the balloon astonishingly\naccurately.\nThere is an altimeter in the balloon, and it's \u2022also quite easy at low altitudes to estimate\nyour height by looking over the edge of the\nbasket at the ground. Yet Andy explained that\nneither of these is the best way of judging\nwhether the balloon is climbing or dropping;\nthe most accurate method for an experienced\npilot is to use parallax on distant objects\u2014\nwhen nearer objects are rising relative to the\nhorizon, the balloon is dropping, and vice\nversa.\nAbout half an hour after we had set off our\nnavigator announced that we were approaching Leeds airspace, and so we began looking\nfor a suitable place to land. Airports, not sur-pri singly, mistrust balloonists; Heathrow\nwas once completely shut down for thirty\nminutes at a cost of several million pounds\nbecause they thought two balloons had drifted\ninto their airspace.\nIt's wise to avoid landing in fields with\ncultivated crops, and grazing livestock is\nworse\u2014the shock to a pregnant cow of having\na balloon land in her field can cause her to lose\nher calf.\nThe first three fields we passed were all\ncultivated with one kind of crop or another,\nalthough this isn't as obvious as one might\nthink from the air. The next field had cows\ngrazing in it, but the field after that looked\nideal\u2014which was lucky, since it was the last\npossibility if we were not to trespass into Leeds\nairport's airspace.\nIt was not until we crossed the fence into the\ncow field that we saw that our intended landing\nsite was not what it had first appeared. In one\ncorner was an electricity substation, and the\nwhole field was criss-crossed with a fan of\npower lines.\nAndy shut off the burners and\nexplained that cows or no cows,\nwe would have to make a fairly\nrapid landing into the held beneath\nus.\nAt the top of the balloon is a parachute-type opening which can\nbe regulated by a long red cord\nwhich hangs into the basket. By\nmanipulating this Andy was able\nto aim for, and eventually hit a dry\nditch, thus bringing the basket to\nan immediate halt and not letting it\ndrag across the field.\nAs we hit the ground, the basket tipped over\nonto its side and the occupants were thrown\ninto a heap on the floor. Immediately we were\nstationary Gill disentangled herself and ran to\ncomfort the panicking cows. This reduced the\nweight of the basket of course, and it began to\nmove again, thus enabling me to make my sole\ncontribution to the flight by pulling the red\nparachute cord to deflate the balloon.\nWe had barely caught our breath from\nlanding when Colin and the rest of the crew\nappeared on the scene. They had been\nfollowing us in the minibus and had now come\nto help us pack everything away as swi fly ais\npossible.\nGill had placated the cows and our main\nproblem now was satisfying their curiosity; a typical cow, it seems, is not content to sample\nthe sight and smell of a balloon, but she wants\nto taste it too!\nMy final surprise of the evening came after\nall the equipment had been packed away and\nwe were preparing to carry it back to the\nminibus: balloons are heavy! To fly a balloon\ntakes about a quarter of a ton of equipment,\nand most of that is the balloon envelope\nitself\u2014no joke when yo q have to carry it the\nentire length of a boggy cow field to get back to\nthe van.\nAnd so, inevitably, back to the railway\nstation for a few pints. As I mentioned earlier,\nthe ballooning fraternity is quite small, and this_ immediately promotes a great feeling of-friendship and camaraderie, the alcoholic*\nmanifestation of which I was pleased to enjoy.\nIt's easy to see the appeal of ballooning, and\nto anyone who has ever considered it I urge\nyou to try it now while you're at IC, and tl je heavy capital outlay is all covered by the\nUnion. There's still plenty of time to enjoy a balloon trip this summer, and anyone who is\ninterested should get in touch with Colin\nButter on internal 3521.\nMartin S Taylor\nWhile practical balloonists re pack the envelope in its bag, the FELIX\neditor does the no less important job of keeping the cows from eating\nthe basket\n\n"

    "content": "ISTUDENT SERVICESI\nprovided under insurance\nschemes. Getting treatment may\nbe more complicated than in the\nUK, but visitors have to follow\nthe same rules as local people.\nLeaflet SA36 available from\nStudent Services outlines what\nto do about getting medical\ntreatment in each of the community countries. Sometimes\ntreatment is free. Sometimes\nyou may have to pay part of the\ncost yourself. Or you may have\nto pay the full cost and then\nclaim a full or partial refund.\nClaim any refund before you\nreturn to the UK. If you leave it\nuntil your return you will face a long wait, or lose the money\naltogether. Follow the rules for\nthe country you are visiting or\nyou will have to pay charges that\ncannot be refunded. And have\nyour Ell with you (plus a photocopy in France, Germany\nor the Netherlands). In some\nCommunity countries\u2014and\nparticularly in Greece\u2014the Ell does not cover all medical\nexpenses. It never covers the cost\nof repatriation so check with a travel agent or insurance company about extra insurance\ncover.\nAny other countries\nIf you require medical treatment\nin any country other than those\ncovered above, you will be\nexpected to meet the full cost of\nany treatment. In the case of an\naccident or serious illness this\ncould amount to thousands of\npounds. So you must make sure\nyou have enough travel insurance to cover any substantial\nexpenses as these cannot be\nreimbursed to you. Travel\ninsurance can be arranged\nthrough most major insurance\ncompanies including Endsleigh\nInsurance (based at 71 Old\nBrompton Road) and National\nWestminster Insurance Services\n(contact Tom Cottrell through\nNational Westminster Bank,\nSherfield Building) and leaflets\nare available from Student\nServices. Cost is normally about\n\u00a310 per adult for a fortnight's cover in Europe and the Mediterranean area altho ug premiums are usually higher for the\nUSA and Canada.\nMotoring Abroad\nIf you are driving anywhere\nabroad, including those countries where you would normally\nbe entitled to free or reduced\nrate medical treatment, you may\nnot be covered for the treatment\nyou need if you have an accident.\nCheck this with your car insurance company or motoring\norganisation before you leave\nthe UK.\nKaren Stott\nStudent Services\nBENEFITS FOR THE\nSUMMER VACATION\nUnlike the Christmas and Easter\nholidays, there is no element\nincluded in the student grant to\ncover maintain ance over the\nsummer vacation and therefore\nif you are unable to get a job\nbetween July and October you\nwill be eligible to 'sign on' as\nunemployed in the area in which\nyou are living. Many of you are\nprobably 'old hands' at this by\nnow but as you may be aware\nthere have been some important\nchanges in the system since\nEaster so as well as providing a brief guide for the uninitiated,\nthis article also hopes to give you\nan idea of how the new legislation affects you.\nThere are three main types of\nbenefit: unemployment benefit,\nsupplementary benefit and\nhousing benefit.\nThey are not mutually exclusive and therefore it is\npossible to receive two or all\nFELIXmmkwkwammkmm\nthree types of benefits simultaneously (but only up to a maximum of approx \u00a325 + rent a week for a single person).\n1. Unemployment Benefit\nTo be eligible for this you will\nhave to have paid Class 1\nNational Insurance contributions\non earnings of at least \u00a31,350\nbetween April 1981 and April\n1982. This will give you a basic\nrate of \u00a325 per week or a little\nless if you do not quite meet the\ncontribution conditions. You\nwill automatically be given the\nclaim forms for unemployment\nbenefit when you sign on (see\n'How to claim' below) but take\nyour P45 and a note of your\nNational Insurance number\nwith you.\n2. Supplementary Benefit\nOriginally conceived as a 'safety\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 June 16,\nnet' for those unable to meet the\ncontribution conditions for\nunemployment benefit but now\nprovides the principal source of\nincome for a large proportion of\nthe country's unemployed\nincluding most student claim-ants. Eligibility is primarily\ndependent on the claimant's ability to sign on as available for\nwork in the area in which they\nare living. There are two rates of\nbenefit\u2014householder and non-householder. 'Householder'\nimplies someone who is individually responsible for all household expenses but even if you\nshare a flat or house with others\nbut have your own room,\nmeters, etc, it may be possible to\nargue that you are maintaining a separate household. If you think\nyou have been incorrectly\nclassified you can appeal (see\nbelow). The basic rates for\nSupplementary Benefit are:\nhouseholder \u00a3 2 5 . 7 0 ; non-householder \u00a320.55.\nHow to claim Unemployment/\nSupplementary Benefit\nOn the fist weekday of the\nvacation go down to your local\nunemployment benefit office\n(addresses in the phone book)\nand sign on as available for\nwork. They will tell you any\nfuture arrangements for signing\non, get you to fill in a number\nof forms and give you a B1 claim\nform which should be taken or\nsent to the local Supplementary\nBenefit Office. You will usually\nbe called for an interview by this\noffice and you will need to take\nwith you proof of identity,\nrecent bank statements and your\nrent book/tenancy agreement/\nletter from your landlord\n(Student Services if in College\naccommodation).\nAnyone receiving un employ ment/supplementary benefit is\nentitled to free NHS dental\ntreatment, glasses and prescriptions. So if you think you might\nbe needing any of them ask for\nan exemption certificate whilst\nyou are at the DHSS office.\n3. Housing Benefit\nAs from April 4 responsibility\nfor meeting any housing costs\nhas been shifted onto the local\nhousing authorities. Two new\ntypes of benefit have been\nintroduced:\na) Certificated housing bene-fit: for those re cie ving supple-ment ary/ unemployment benefit\nand so called because eligibility\nis dependent on receipt of a certificate of entitlement from\nthe DHSS. Under this benefit\nyou may receive 100% of your\nhousing costs.\nb) Standard housing benefit:\nreplacing the old rent and rate\nallowance schemes. Anyone can\napply\u2014the basic rebate is 60%\nof your rent with certain additions or d educations according\nto your income.\nSpecial conditions applying to\nstudents during term time prevent many students from claiming any housing benefit during\nthe terms although it is always\nworth applying. During the\nsummer students returning to\ntheir parental home will not be\neligible for any housing benefit\nbut those remaining and 'signing\non' in London should receive\ncertificated benefit. If you have\nto pay a retainer on your term-time accommodation over the\nsummer it is worth putting in an\napplication for standard housing\nbenefit since this can be paid\nwhilst you are absent from the\naddress at which you pay rent\nalthough we do not at present\nknow how housing authorities\nare likely to treat such cases.\nHow to claim Housing Benefit\nIf you are receiving un employ ment/supplementary benefit you\ndon't need to do anything as a certificate of entitlement should\nbe sent automatically to the\nhousing benefit office on your\nbehalf by the DHSS. For standard housing benefit call into the\nlocal housing authority office\n(usually based in the Town Hall)\nfor the area in which you are\npaying rent, or come into\nStudent Services and collect a housing benefit application\nform. Your claim will be dated\nfrom the day on which your\ncompleted from s are received by\nyour local housing office. TJle\nhousing authority do have the\npower previously invested in the\nDHSS to reduce the amount\nthey pay you in certificated cases\nif they consider your rent to be\nexcessively high. If you think\nthey have used this power\nunreasonably you can appeal\n(see below).\nSome points to note when claiming benefits\nHolidays: Housing benefit can\nbe paid during temporary\nabsences but you should let the\nhousing benefit office know your\nplans. For unemployment/\nsupplementary benefit you can\ncomplete a holiday form which\nwill allow you up to sixteen days\naway within the British Isles\nwithout losing benefit but you\nmust sign on again as soon as\nyou return. If you go on holiday\ncontinued on page 16\n19831 IPagelS\n\n"

    "content": "In his last opinion article this year, moralist Michael\nNewman questions our attitudes to work, play,\npolitics, life, the Universe and everything and recommends that we start\nBreaking Glass\nCages\nI arrived at this college with\ntrepidation, for not only was it\nthe first time I would have to\nfend for myself but I felt afraid\nof the large city and the new\npeople I would have to meet. I was also very excited. I was\nactually going to study at a university, a community of\nlearning and intellectual debate.\nMy father, who studied at LSE\nin philosophy and ec nom ics, must take some responsibility\nfor the exaggerated idea of an\noasis of thought in the desert of\nconformity and social is ation. It was within the first few\nweeks that I began to realise I had been so wrong in my\nexpectations. In the last three\nyears I had been arguing at my\nschool, a boys' grammar school,\nthat one sure place of self-awareness and critical and lively\ninformed conversation were our\ninstitutions of further education,\nour universities. It seemed to me\nthen, as it does still, that we are\nnot taught or even brought up in\nan environment of questioning,\nof Bertrand Russell's liberating\ndoubt. That so many of our\nattitudes, beliefs and arguments\nare accepted without the 'consent\nof our deliberate reason',\nwithout a concerted and conscious effort on our behalves to\nseek and question the assumptions, the validity, the very\nmeanings of the words and the\nconsequences of our beliefs.\nInstead we seek comfort in their\npopularity, our own ignorance\nand the common use of such\nterms as obvious, natural,\nreality, inevitable, freedom and\nthe use of de human ising labels.\nWhen would we be taught or\nencouraged to break our minds\nout of their internment in their\nown glass cages of accepted\nideas? From my experience it\nwas not likely to be our primary\nschools, our secondary schools,\nor our parents\u2014>who are products of the same system. The\nonly hope was our universities.\nAt least here there should be the\nopportunity to widen and free\nour minds of the restraints of\nour upbringing.\nYet this was not to be so,\nthough the opportunities are\nhere I had forgotten the effect of\n18 to 19 years of general\nsocial is ation and the strength of\nthe glass walls of heavily\nengraved prejudices and beliefs.\nWhen this is coupled to a heavy\nacademic timetable one cannot\nbe surprised at the philosophical\nand political apathy a number of\nfirst years comment on before\nbeing dragged down by it.\nWe are simply here to have a good time and gain sufficient\nqualifications for a nice job and\nsocial status. This is just another\nPage 41\nMichael Newman\nsection of the conveyor belt as\nportrayed in Pink Floyd's The\nWall. We are being processed\ninto a commodity for the\ndecreasing job market.\nThe concept of institutional\neducation being the base of a free and democratic system\nencouraging doubt, inquisitiveness and enquiry before decision\nmaking, breaking glass cages, is\nsubjugated to a factory for the\nproduction and selection of\nappropriate labour skills. There\nare exceptions of course and\nthere are attempts to lessen the\neffects of this mass production\n(eg the Humanities Department),\nbut they do not counter the\noverall emphasis of the system\nand its major purpose as expressed by its structure and its\nproducts.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 June This apathy is understandable\nand, so long as you accept my\nexplanations, can be changed.\nTo bring about this change, like\nwith any change in human\nattitudes and behaviour, we\nmust criticise, we must let our\nvoices be heard. What is less\nunderstandable, indeed exasperating, is not that we simply find\napathy but we find those who\nnot only defend it but ironically\nactively encourage it. There are\npeople who try to prevent the\nactive and interested from using\nthe Union as one outlet for their\nviews. The Union should not\ndiscuss anything to do with\npolitics, it has nothing to do with\npolitics and should not debate it.\nThe editor of Morning Cloud\namong others holds this opinion.\nIt is true that a union whose\nmembers are disproportionately\nmale, and who are studying\ntopics that involve atomic\npower, uranium mining j the\nnature of human behaviour and\ndesires, industry etc, who are\npossibly future employees of the\nMoD or South Africa, who are\npossibly members of a union\nwhich sells pornography (eg\nHon Porn Night), who are not\nmembers of the NUS, and who\nare being affected by education\ncuts, is not involved in politics?\nUsing the common rhetoric of\nmy opponents, when will they\ntake their heads out of the sand?\nThe nature of democracy is\nthat it is a system of government\nthat gives responsibility for\ngoverning to all society's mem-be rs. We express our choice of\nwhat kind of government we\nwish to give power not just in\nour votes but in our conversations with others in pubs, in our\nhomes, on the street, on TV, in\nletters, at UG Ms. We can\nactively persuade or simply\ninform and in doing so we\nsupport a way of government\nand the politics we would like to\nsee followed. Simply by talking\nor even deciding not to talk we\nimmediately become involved in\nthe democratic process, in\npolitics. The very nature of\ndemocracy is that you cannot\nescape. We are all responsible to\nsome degree for the type of\ngovernment we have whether we\nvoted or not and whatever way\nwe voted unless we do not have\nthe ability to comprehend the\ndecisions facing us. We are faced\nwith the choices of whether to\nvote, for whom to vote, whether\nto talk about politics, which\nparticular set of policies we\nwould support in conversation\nand indeed is our everyday\nbehaviour. I believe we do not\ncomprehend enough these\n16,1983BII MII1 M IIIB HI WII1 III choices, something not due to\nlack of ability but a result of\nprejudice and ignorance. You\nmust not blame the democratic\nsystem for the type of government and society we have, you\nmust blame the people, including\nyourself. The education system\nshould be the safeguard er of\ndemocracy, it should diminish\nnot only ignorance but indoctrination, social is ation and\napathy. In this it fails.\nAs our Union is a democratic\nsociety we, its members, can be\nsaid to be responsible for its\nactions. If our Union fails to\ncriticise such dangers as pornography then we are responsible.\nIf it goes further and actively\nsells pornography, advertising\nits sales, trying to raise as much\nmoney as possible from the sales\neven if it's only once or twice a year at Hon Porn Night we are\nresponsible. We are all responsible. It is in our power as a collective force to prevent the\ninstitutional is ed selling of\npornography but we fail and it\ngoes on. I am responsible. Those\nwho picketed the Mines Revue\nare responsible, the Rector is\nresponsible, you are responsible.\nIn the end when the institutional is ed sale of pornography\nor its showing is banned we will\nall be responsible, in part.\nMany people have claimed it\nis the individual's right to seek\nentertainment in whatever\nmanner s/ he pleases as long as it\ndoes not hurt anyone and is\ndone in private. This is not the\nissue at stake; this right is not to\nbe taken from us, it is a right\nmostly guarded in law. What we\nare all faced with in this demo\ncrat ic system is whether our\nUnion should sell pornography\nWhether we want to be faced\nwith the responsibility of\nallowing this sale to continue. It\nis not as some people proclaim\nnothing to do with them-simple matter of deciding\nwhether to go or not. It is not a matter of simply allowing people\nto purchase porn. It is a matter\nof being able to stop a body you\nbelong to from expressing an\nactive support for the pornographic industry in its actions or\norganised events and not doing\nso.\nIf you disagree with the\nshowing of pornography and\nthink it is p ossi by dangerous\nthen perceive your responsibilities, criticise people and make\ndecisions that can and will\neventually stop the active\npresence of the porno graph ii industry and market within our\ncollege.\nLet's start breaking glass cages\nwma mm \u2014m umm FELI\n\n"

    "content": "TUDE1T SERVICES\na definitive guide to surviving the summer\nKaren Stott, Student Services, new Welfare Assistant, has\nproduced this report to help you recognise and deal with the\nproblems that you might encounter over the summer.\nACCOMMODATION\nNEWS\nSummer Vacation\nAre you - fretting over how\nyou're going to fill all those long\nsummer days until the beginning\nof October? Or are you seeking\nsome remunerative employment\nin an attempt to wipe out this\nyear's overdraft? Either way\nstaying in London could be the\nanswer to your problems. Many\nstudents spend three years or\nmore in London without ever\nreally sampling the delights of\nour capital city, so why not\nspend all or part of your summer\nvacation here and get to know\nWhat London is truly like. On\nthe other hand London also\nabounds with large department\nstores who regularly seek extra\nstaff during the summer so why\nnot combine work and holiday.\nEither way Imperial is offering\nac com mod at in in IC Halls for\nboth staff and students at\nterm time rates throughout the\nsummer. Although the closing\ndate for applications has officially passed, we do still have\nvacancies, so if you're interested\nit's not too late to collect an\napplication form from Student\nServices.\nYou may also have some\nfriends or relatives who want to\nspend some time in London over\nthe summer. Again we can offer\naccommodation at very cheap\nrates so why not call into\nStudent Services for further\ndetails.\nNext Year\nObviously many of you are now\nanxious to start the search for\naccommodation for next year.\nAlthough October may not seem\nfar away to you, unfortunately\nmost private landlords/ladies do\nnot plan their accommodation\nthis far in advance and therefore\nStudents Services do not become\ninformed of the vast majority of\naccommodation until September.\nWe do have a limited amount of\naccommodation for next session\non our files at the moment, and\nwe are currently in the process of\ncontacting some of our regular\nlandlords/ladies to assess what\nthey will have available, so if for\nany reason you cannot use\nSeptember to find ac com moda tion, it is worth calling into\nStudent Services to see if we can\nhelp. We do also h jive an\nupdated guide to some agencies\nwho may be able to help you\nalthough most of these are again\nreluctant to take registrations\nfrom people too far in advance.\nIf you are able to come down\nto London in September, this is\nby far the best time to look. We\nshould be able to accommodate\nyou in IC Hall any time up to\nSeptember 24 (just give us a ring\non 01-589 5111 ext 2033 one\nweek before you come down)\nafter that there will be crash pad\naccommodation in the students'\nunion (bring a sleeping bag). At\nthat time Student Services\nshould have comprehensive lists\nof vacancies and an accommodation guide to give you hints on\nwhere to start. You may not\ndiscover the home of your\ndreams but with a little patience,\nfootwork and a lot of 5p pieces\nyou should be able to find\nsomething quite reasonable.\nKaren Stott\nStudent Services\nMEDICAL TREATMENT\nABROAD\nHopefully anyone planning to\ntravel the high seas and see the\nworld during the summer will\nhave read Dr Addenbrooke's article in FELIX (3 June 1983)\nabout the importance of consulting your doctor well in advance\nof your journey to ensure you\nhave the necessary health\nprotection in the form of\nim munis at ions etc. Before a foreign holiday the last thing\nyou want to worry about is the\npossibility of illness or an\naccident while you are away. But\nthese things could happen and if\nthey do you won't want the\nadded problem of facing a big\nbill for medical treatment.

    "content": "A Glance Backwards\nI must admit I'm rather proud of\nthis issue; IC hasn't seen a twenty-six page FELIX in nearly\nfour years (the last time was\nColin Palmer's Freshers' issue\u2014\n32 pages) and it's a great tribute\nto the staff that we've managed\nit in an unbelievable three days.\nThroughout the year I 've\nstriven to make FELIX as large\nas possible. My guiding principle\nin producing the newspaper has\nbeen Steve Marshall's dictum\n'Aim to produce a newspaper\nwhich you yourself would like to\npick up on Friday mornings,'\nand this has meant a marked\nincreased in size. Happily, the\nconsequent inevitable sacrifice in\nterms of design has not been too\nsevere, although I have been a little disappointed that there\nhasn't been time to be more\nadventurous with graphics and\nlayout. Pallab intends to reverse\nthe trend, and so next year you\ncan expect FELICES which are\nsmaller but packed with exciting\nnew ideas on the artistic side.\nFELIX has also been rather\nlaid-back this year, and there has\nbeen little aggressive criticism of\nthe kind we have been used to.\nThis has been quite deliberate. It\nis clear to me that many College\nadministrators (Mooney being\nthe supreme example) refuse to\ntake FELIX seriously and\nbelieve that any criticism of their\nshortcomings is the result of a personal and mindless vendetta\non the part of the Editor,\nsymptomatic of what they see as\nthe general irresponsible attitude\nof today's students. The way to\nget out of this rut is, in my\nopinion, not by insulting Sherfield Building, or even by\nmaking continual jokes about it\n(although these will have their\nplace) but by first getting FELIX\naccepted as a> responsible organ\nof student opinion and then\nmaking detailed and reasoned\ncriticism of its failings. This will\nnot be easy. It cannot be done\nquickly. But I believe it is the\nonly way to get College block\nto sit up and take FELIX seriously.\nMy biggest disappointment\nthis year has been over feature\narticles. Looking back through\nthe archives over the past few\nyears, nearly every editor, in his\nelection manifesto and early\nissues, has promised bigger and\nmore regular features; but by the\nend of the year they have all\nbeen a polo gi sing and saying that\nthere just hasn't been time.\nPerhaps this is one of the facts of\nlife\u2014that producing FELIX just\ndoesn't allow the large amount\nof time a good feature article\nFELIX HH HH H EDITORIAL\nThere are so many people who have made FELIX what it is\nthis year that I can't hope to list them all, but if you have ever\ndone anything constructive for me this year, consider\nyourself thanked.

But I hope and believe this\nis not so, and a hardworking\nfeatures editor (one of the posts\non this year's staff which has\nnever been taken) should be able\nto do wonders for FELIX.\nAnd so to the news. When I took the job of Editor I was\nwarned that it takes about sixty\nhours a week\u2014thirty of them on\nThursdays. Producing such large\neditions has meant that I have\nhad to spend all of Wednesday\nand Thursday of each week organ ising, administering and helping,\nwhich has left absolutely no time\nleft to write the news. Consequently I am grateful beyond\nwords to Adrian James who\ntook on the hateful job of news\neditor in September and has\ndone it, efficiently and reliably,\nall year\u2014longer, I believe, than\nanyone else in the history of\nFELIX.\nNews reporting sounds so\nsimple in theory. In practice\nalmost every story has its own\nproblems attached, mainly\nbecause people hate to see their\nnames in print. Frequently\npeople refuse to talk to FELIX\nat all (and then complain when\nwe get the facts slightly wrong);\nand if we do get a good story in\nfull detail, there is certain to be\nUune 16,19831\nsomeone cringing at the office\ndoor whining at me not to print\nthe story because 'what happened is all in the past now'.\nIn view of these problems (and\nI know people will disagree with\nme on this) I consider the news\nto have been one of the strong\npoints of this year's FELIX.\nPallab has said he can do better:\nI hope he can, and I wish him\nluck\u2014but I don't believe him.\nNext Year\nThere will only be one postgraduate FELIX over the summer and it will appear on August\n7. I'm sure Pallab would appreciate any articles for this and\nhelp in producing it, so if you're\naround over the summer with\ntime to kill, come and indulge\nyour tempor ici dal instincts in\nFELIX.\nFor the Freshers' FELIX Pallab has set the deadline for\nclubs and societies articles at\nSeptember 7, but is hoping many\nof them will be submitted this\nterm (he'll be lucky!).\nCCUs\nThere is one important aspect of\nthe Union which merits an end-of-year comment and, for better\nor worse, it's rather negative. In\nrecent weeks the CC Us in\ngeneral and RCSU in particular\nhave been prominent in the\nnews.\nI often wonder how they can\nbe so shortsighted as to provoke\na relatively placid Exec when\nChristine Teller and Gaynor\nLewis are about to take over.\nCan't they see that Christine (in\nparticular) will be looking for\nany excuse to cut back on the\ncash ICU gives to the over-financed CCUs next year, and by\nbehaving as childishly as they\nhave recently they are giving h tr just the opportunity she heeds?\nPersonally, I would support\nChristine in her aims, since !\nfirmly believe the CCUs represent a minority interest in\nCollege. The CCUs do have a very strong case, but they aren't going to advance it much if they\ncarry on as they have been\nrecently.\nFELIX Car Rally\nSunday morning from 9:30am till lunchtime.

    "content": "FELIX: What does the job of Union\nPresident involve?\nSG: Briefly speaking, it is an administrative\nand representational job to ensure the Union\nruns effectively for twelve months to\nrepresent the views of the Union determined\nthrough UGMs to .College and external\nbodies. The job also entails coordinating\nthe work of Union representatives on\ncommittees and to formulate overall policy.\nBriefly, that's it. There are many many\nminor tasks which would probably bore the\nreaders of FELIX.\nFELIX: What were your objectives at the\nstart of the year?\nSG: To ensure the Union ran effectively and\nto fully represent the views of its students to\nCollege and to other bodies, and to allow\nordinary students access to as many facilities\nas possible.\n.FELIX: One of your main achievements this\nyear, of course, has been the systematic\ndismantling of RCSU, your own CCU, are\nyou proud of this?\nSG: I entirely reject that I had as an\nobjective the dismantling of RCSU. RCS\ndestroyed itself from within. I have not\ntaken an anti-CCU attitude. Possibly in the\ncase of RCS I may have taken a series of\npositions which may be construed to be in\nopposition to CCUs. However I would be\nthe first to say that C& GU and RSMU have\nboth worked effectively to represent their\nmembership quite capably this year. It has\nonly been RCS that has been found to be in\na state of moral decay. I certainly don't accept that RCSU is a victim of a vendetta\nfrom IC Union. We simply addressed\nourselves to its own internal collapse.\nFELIX: It must have come as a great blow to\nlose a Deputy President at the start of the\nyear and then to have an Honorary\nSecretary resign in the first term.\nSG: Yes\n. FELIX: How would you judge Andy\nGrimshaw's performance compared to\nMary's? SG: Andy is a far more likeable chap than\nMary. He shares some of Mary's problems\nin that he was flung in at the deep end. He\ndid make a more conscious attempt to learn\nthe job. Any shortcomings he may have stem\nfrom having been flung in from the deep\nend. He did the best he could under the\ncircumstances.\nFELIX: Can I ask you about the argument\nthat flared up between yourself and Andy\nrecently?\nSG: It was an unfortunate situation that\ncentred around a particular Gestetner that\nhad been left in the Union Office for two and\na half terms. Mike Bartlett from C& GU\ncame up to the Union Office looking for a Gestetner and pointed to one in the corner\nof the Union Office. It had been there one\nand a half terms. I wasn't aware of why it\nshould be there so I said if you want it take it\naway; it seems to be performing no useful\npurpose here. A couple of weeks later at a refectory committee working lunch Frank\nRowsell happened to mention to Andy that\nthis Gestetner was working very well. Andy\nhadn't realised that it had actually gone and\nafter lunch we had an, er...argument over\nthe circumstances of its removal. It was an\nunderstandable error on my part.\nFELIX: Is it true that you were so angry\nafter the whole incident that you threatened\nin your own words, 'to nut the bastard'?\nSG: Well, uncharacteristically I became\ndrunk out of my mind. It always pays to\nclear rather than let pent up frustrations\ncloud the atmosphere of the office.\nFELIX: Do you get drunk often?\nSG: It is a question of degree. I can only\nthink of three or four times I have been\nquite that drunk. The consumption of\nalcohol in its many and various forms is one\nof the aspects of the job of President.\nFELIX: What do you think of next year's sabbaticals?\nSG: Sean Davis does suffer from the\nhandicaps of his predecessors in being\ndistinctly uninvolved in the Union prior to_ Pallab Ghosh, FELIX Editor-elect, shows the\nfull extent of his journalistic capability.\nPage S HH HE HI HH^ BH H BH HH An Audience\nwith the\nPresident\nPallab Ghosh questions Steve\nGoulder's performance\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<\nhis election. This will be insuperable unless\nhe takes steps over the summer to get to\nknow his job. Of the three sabbatical officers\nChristine is the most capable and very\ntalented. I'm sure she will do a very\nprofessional job. However her drawbacks\nstem from the fact that next year will be her\nfifth year as a student at Imperial College\nand I think she will have problems in that\nshe may not have a complete idea of what\npeople four years her junior really want. I think she ought to allow them some say in\nthe running of the Union. Gaynor may have\na problem in keeping Christine in check. She\nwill have to keep control. It would be easy by\ndefault to allow Christine too much rein.\nHowever Gaynor has been involved in\nMines Union which has given her experience\nin dealing with other people.

This is the make or break\ntime.\nFELIX: Jen Hardy-Smith has described you\nas one of the most stylish Presidents she has\nworked for.

Of course\non retirements and special occasions we do\nserve champagne in the office.\nFELIX: How much weight have you gained\nthis year?\nSG: In my first three months of my\nPresidency I actually lost a lot of weight.\nAfter Mary Freeman resigned I proceeded to\nput it all back on, and by Christmas my\nweight had increased by a stone.\nFELIX: Could you tell me a little bit about\nthe INCOST Conference you attended in\nHolland recently?\nSG: I enjoyed it immensely. INCOST is the\ninternational conference of science and\ntechnology students and is held at various\nvenues in Europe. Representatives of\ntechnology students of each member\ncountry are invited. It is basically a venue to\npromote good contacts between those\npeople who will be involved in industry with\ntheir counterparts across Europe.\nFELIX: You didn't promote very good\ncontacts when you threw up over one of the\nFinnish delegates!\nSG: Well that's life. It was hardly an act of\ninternational aggression. They got a far\nbetter impression of the British delegates the\nevening before.\nFELIX: I understand that both yourself and\nJim Boucher, who went with you visited the\nred light district in Amsterdam while you\nwere over there.\nSG: (pause) You're not going to print this\nare you?\nFELIX: Yes\nSG: Er...I refuse to confirm or deny such a rumour.\nFELIX: Don't you feel at all guilty about\nbon king at the Unions expense?\nSG: Of what?\nFELIX: Bonking.\nSG: I don't understand the term.\nFELIX: You know, getting your end away.\nSG: Certa...well...that um, certainly not!\nFELIX: After the first of July you will be a normal human being once more. Do you\nhave any plans for the future?\nSG: I shall attempt to find gainful\nemployment over the summer after which I shall be undertaking an MSc in biochemical\nengineering at University College and then\ninto the industry of biotechnology. Oh, and\nto be Prime Minister in fifty years time.\nFELIX: Thank you very much Steve. I'm sure FELIX would like to wish you all the\nbest for the future.\n\u2022 HH MH MH FELIX "

    "content": "WAIKABOUTLOOKSEE\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nIf the 'Walkabout-Looksee' column has\nachieved nothing else this year, I hope that it's provided sufficient evidence to justify Mobile\nOptics Inc' love for the V&A.I was there again\nlast week in a mood of self-indulgence, not\nquite by chance, but to witness the re-opening\nof the Museum's Dress Collection.\nRestoration and Conservation\nThe huge gallery of the old Costume Court has\nbeen closed for five years for repair, involving\nextensive roof works, and refurbishment.\nSome of the clothes now on show had\npreviously been displayed, untouched, for\ntwenty years. They, and others from the\nmuseum's store, have been painstakingly\nrestored and are now re-displayed in\nshowcases designed to conserve them as well\nas show them off: they are ventilated by\n'breather' units which filter out the dust and\ngaseous air pollutants responsible for the\ndeterioration of fragile textiles; and illuminated\nby tungsten spotlights at low light intensity, to\nprolong the\"exhibits' life.\nIREVIEWSI\nThe art of dressing\nThe study of dress has undergone a major\nrevolution. Gone are the anecdotal period\ntableaux: fashion is now taken seriously. The\nfashionable aspirations of a period are as much\na reflection of society as painting, literature\nand music. Dress is thus an essential\ningredient of a lifestyle and can be treated as\nan art form in its own right.\nThe V&A costume collection is huge and\nglorious. The display includes over 200 figures\nfrom the early 17th century to the present, and\nends with a flourish in 1983, with a Tommy\nNutter suit and Margaret Howell's cottons and\nlinens.\nWho should visit?\nThe fashion-conscious will need no per-sua ding. Those who never notice new\nshoes/dress/etc, and even less appreciate\nunderstated elegance, might still enjoy the\nunderwear cases (!)\u2014boned, tight-laced\ncorsets to define a neat waist and uplift the\nbust; lace-trimmed pantaloons and bloomers,\nfor a grown up Little Miss Muffet.\nThe collection is presented in terms of\nfabric, cut and style. The fashionable\nsilhouette characteristic of each period derives\nnot only from the clothes, but from the choice\nof accessories, the way the hair is dressed, and\nthe way the figure stands, and we are treated\nto a spectacular display of period styles. But the\nmannequins are immobile and expressionless.\nAs such an essential ingredient is missing, and\nwe can only guess at the formality or natural\ngrace of the figures' movements.\nWhere? When? \u00a3?\nThe Dress Collection is part of the Victoria and\nAlbert Museum's permanent collection, and so\nfree. The museum is open Mon-Thurs and Sat\n10:00-17:50; Sun 14:30-17:50.\nDressing gown worn by Thomas Coutts (1735-1822), founder of Coutts Bank.\nFrom Barrow to Brighton, from Abingdon to\nAshby-de-la-Zouch wherever you go, you will\ninevitably stumble across that most un-English\nof English institutions\u2014the Indian restaurant.\nAlmost without exception it will be\nempty\u2014how they manage to make enough\nmoney to keep the army of immaculate clad\nwaiters in bow-ties is an enigma which is to\ngreat mysteries as the Rubik Cube is to the\nSun Junior Crossword.\nYet the greatest mystery of all is that these\ngenerally excellent establishments are not\npacked out with eager disciples of the\nv in da loo or crazed addicts craving for their\ndaily fix of prawn d hansa ak. For a start, prices\ntend to be very reasonable\u2014repletion can be\nachieved in most for under \u00a35 per head.\nService is usually very good. The burger house\nnorm of plate loads of food being plo nk ed in\nfront of you is not the way of the Indian\nrestaurant. Instead it's all 'silver service', coats\ntaken, doors held and thank you very much.\nMost important of all is the food, which\noffers a wide range of exotic and exciting\ntastes.\nThe most likely explanation of the apparent\nlack of enthusiasm for Indian food is that most\npeople don't know how to get the best out of\nan Indian restaurant. Confronted by an\nenormous list of meaningless names,\nun adventurous folk might opt for the starter,\nmain course, dessert approach which is\nunlikely to prove satisfactory. To enjoy Indian\nfood you need to understand the menu and be\nadventurous.\nThere are two basic types of menu. The\nleast expensive is usually the one which\nconsists of long lists of dishes categorised\nunder meat dishes, chicken dishes, fish dishes,\nsundries and so on. In the more expensive\nrestaurants, the menus offer fewer dishes but\neach is described in glowing terms which give\nyou no idea at all of what it is going to taste\nlike.\nMost restaurants offer Tandoori dishes\nwhich are supposed to be cooked in a special\nclay oven, although one suspects that in many\ncases the clay oven is a figment of the menu\nwriter's imagination. Tandoori dishes are very\ndifferent from curries and tend to be rather\ndry.\nAnother type of dish is the Biriany which is a rice dish. (For most other dishes, you have to\norder the rice separately.) Sometimes bir i any s are served with a vegetable curry, but if not, it\nis wise to order one as a bir i any is aris s otto type dish which does not have a sauce of its\nown. Most of the other main dishes come\nunder the general heading of curries although\nthey vary tremendously. For example the\ndreaded p ahl, hotter even than av in da loo is\napproximately eight times as hot as a standard\ncurry and apart from being virtually inedible\nproduces unfortunate and very painful after\neffects!\nAt the other end of the scale, a Kurma is\nmildly spicy and suitable for the most delicate\ntastes.\nAn essential accompaniment to Indian food\nis the wide range of breads. Costing between\n25p and 80p they are an inexpensive way of\nensuring satisfaction for even the most\nrapa ca cio us appetite. The main types are Nan\nwhich is a tando ori bread and is available\nstuffed with meat, vegetables or fruit. Puree is\nflaky and a little greasy, Porota and Chapati\nare likely chewy pancakes. Pappadoms are\nlight and crispy. Of these, plain nan and\npapp a dom s are generally the best value.\nIf you are rather dubious about Indian\nfood\u2014try the following combination as a gentle introduction.\nWhile perusing the menu, order a pint of\nlager (wine doesn't really go) and a couple of\npapp a dom s each and (if you are feeling\nadventurous) some Bombay Duck better\ndescribed as dried fish.\nIn due course order onion bha j ees as a starter. Unlike most bha j ees which are a sort\nof spicy vegetable stew, an onion bha j ee is a ball of deep fried onions and batter served with\na yoghurt based dip.\nFor the main course try a fairly mild curry\nwith pilau rice and some nan together with any\nother inexpensive side dishes which might\nappeal. This should be a more than sufficient\nrepast which is probably a good thing since\nIndian puddings tend to be rather sickly.\nAt this point, you will, of course, be wanting\nto rush out and tuck into an Indian. The\nnearest venue is the Aladin at the bottom of\nExhibition Road. Although this restaurant has\nbeen slated in successive editions of the Union\nHandbook, it is actually fairly good, although\nthe onion bha j ees are disappointing. South\nKensington and Knightsbridge have a high\nproportion of the expensive type, an excellent\nexample being the Tandoori of Chelsea at 153\nFulham Road. Although you can expect to pay\n\u00a325 for two for the whole works, the food there\nis really excellent. Just opposite Earls Court\nUnderground in Hogarth Road is the New Asia\nwhere you can expect to get away with a fiver\na head including a pint of lager.\nThe area around the Drayton Arms in Old\nBrompton Road is an excellent spot in that a couple of beers at the Drayton can be followed\nby a meal at any one of three reasonably\npriced Indian restaurants within a radius of fifty\nyards\u2014a perfect recipe for a summer's evening.\nFELIX is published by the Editor lor and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit Prince Consort Road.
