    "content": "Taking the brain strain\nby Don Adlington\nWritten, formal examinations have a hallowed place\nin academic life and while from time to time,\neducation a lists have espoused alternative methods,\nthey are widely accepted as the fairest and most\nefficient means of assessing students' knowledge and\nunderstanding.\nThe written examination is not however by any\nmeans a precise instrument. It is certainly possible,\nfor example on individual papers, to come up with a 'fluke' result, that is a result markedly better than the\nstudent's actual ability would have led one to expect.\nIt is also unquestionably possible to come up with\nresults that are worse than either the student or his\nteachers anticipated, and which do not fairly reflect\nthe student's ability.\nThe risk of systematically under performing in a set\nof examinations is linked to two separate, but closely\nrelated factors: (a) an inadequate technique for playing\nthe examination game, and (b) an inadequate\nrecognition that a formal examination, like any form\nof testing situation, can generate levels of anxiety\nwhich in themselves may have an adverse effect on\nintellectual functioning.\nPLAYING THE EXAMINATION GAME\nExaminations are to some extent an abstraction from\nreality, an artificial construct. They are a sort of game\nin which the participants are invited to demonstrate\nwhat they know, in writing, on a blank piece of paper,\nin a set time. An important component of the game\nis that the examiner is forbidden to give credit on any\nother evidence than that presented in the script. It is\nan astonishing fact that despite this elementary point,\nsome students insist on abandoning commonsense to\nthe extent, apparently of playing another game\naltogether. A common manifestation of this is the\nstudent who spends an hour and three quarters (out\nof three hours) writing, re-writing, polishing and\nperfecting one answer out of four or five required.\nAnother common departure from the rules consists\nin writing out the an wer s without properly reading the\nquestions. There are two, equally devastating variants\nto this: (a) not selecting the questions which opt i mise the candidate's chances of scoring high overall, and\n(b) misreading individual questions and subsequently\nwriting an answer to a question which in effect is not\nthere.\nSome basic and well recognised components of a good examination technique are as follows:\n1. Read the question paper carefully, preferably\ntwice. Errors of perception are highly correlated with\nheightened anxiety.\n2. Select the questions you are going to answer,\nput them in order, and write out a simple timetable,\nallowing the same time to all questions (assuming the\nsame maximum marks for each). Allow fifteen\nminutes for the planning and five minutes at the end\nfor finishing off. Some people find that it helps to\nmake quick notes on each question at this stage.\n3. Be disciplined in adhering to the timetable.\nRecognise that the first few marks accruing to a question can be obtained far more easily than the last\nfew-and it is the total mark which counts. If you get\nstuck in the middle of a question leave it and deal with\nthe next one. You can always return to the unfinished\nanswer later, and indeed the very act of disengaging\nfrom the difficulty may allow a resolution to surface\nwhile your mind is actually focussed on something\nelse.\nPage 10\n4. Answer the easiest question first, so that you can\nproceed to the others on a psychological 'high'.\n5. Don't be afraid to make rough notes in your\nanswer book. When you are answering one question\nideas relating to other questions you are going to\nanswer may come into your head-jot them down.\nSimilarly on entering the examination room, and\npossibly before reading the paper at all, you may wish\nto write down very quickly salient points which you\nhave memorised in your final preparation.\nIt is, of course, essential to rule out rough work very\nclearly, so that the examiner knows that it does not\nform part of your answer!\n6. If you run out of time tell the examiner so, and\nsay which points you would have gone on to discuss\nif you had more time.\nDEALING WITH ANXIETY\nA degree of anxiety, accompanied by recognised\nphysiological symptoms, is a normal reaction to\ntesting and stressful situations. Everyone is affected\nto some extent and should be aware of it. You tell\nyourself that you are anxious, that it is natural, and\nthat you can handle it. In doing that, you minimise the\nrisk that the anxiety may escalate to a point where\nit becomes disabling. Again there seem to be some\ncommonsense ways of handling this problem.\nArrive early-it is far better to be biting your nails\noutside the examination room, than sitting in a traffic\njam at Earl's Court. Once you are in the examination\nroom, sit down and relax a minute or two before doing\nanything.\nTo a certain extent anxiety is contagious. If you feel\nthat this is a hazard for you, then 'keep yourself to\nyourself before admission to the examination room.\nIt may also be worthwhile resisting the impulse to\ncompare notes with all your friends immediately after\nan exam.\nIt is also a good idea in the examination itself not\nto let yourself be thrown if your neighbours appear\nto be writing with more facility than you are. They\nmay, for all you know, be writing rubbish, and in any\ncase, inordinately long answers do not necessarily\nbring the best results.\nThe most common symptom of anxiety getting out\nof hand, is an overwhelming sense of panic, a temporary breakdown of our rational and ordered\nresponse to a demanding situation. In an examination\nthis may, for example, take the form of 'blanking\nout'-completely forgetting everything. The remedy\nfor this is to switch off, close your eyes, and do\nnothing for a while.\nThis is far better than yielding too easily to the\npowerful impulse to resolve the tension by giving up\naltogether. When you feel that the anxiety attack has\nabated, try getting your mind working again by using\na 'scribble technique'. Just write down words-any\nwords-which lead to other words, until you feel that\nyour faculty of recall is available to you again.\nA final point. If you have a history of becoming\nparticularly anxious at exam times, or if for contingent\nreasons you think that you may do so this time, it\nwould be sensible to talk to someone about it well\nbeforehand. Tell your personal tutor or your senior\ntutor, talk to a doctor or nurse at the Health Centre,\nor come to see me. Just a small amount of practical\nhelp may make a substantial difference in the event.\nDon Adlington, Student Counsellor.\n\n"

He said that the\ntransfusion should take half an hour for each person.\nPassing on\nThe head of the Mechanical Engineering Department,\nProfessor Tom Hubbard, will be resigning his post\nat the end of September.\nProfessor Husband told Felix that he had been very\nhappy at Imperial College and had left to become the\nVice-Chancellor of Salford University.\nProfessor Husband's successor will be decided by\nthe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, in the near future.\nNew books\nMr Michael Newman, a zoology graduate from IC,\nlaunched a collection of writings by H.G. Wells over\nEaster. H.G. Wells was a biology graduate of the\ncollege during the last century.\nThe book, called 'Breaking the Shackles',\ncondemns current education policies and continues\nthe debate into free and liberal education. The book\nis available from the IC Union Bookstore at \u00a31.95,\nthe profits from which will go towards a conference\non 'bullying.'\nTwo students from St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool, Gerard Short and Nick Stafford, have been\ngiven the go-ahead to compile a book entitled\n'Studying Medicine\u2014a Student Guide to Medical\nSchools in Britain'. It will be published this summer.\nGerard Short was elected to the executive of the\n'National Association of Medical Students' just before\nEaster. This is a new organisation set up to 'increase\ncommunication between medical schools in the\ncountry', said Mr Stafford.\nMarathon\nNight Security superintendent, Mr Bob Dickens,\ncompleted the London Marathon last Sunday in 3\nhours 50 minutes.

In addition, no provision for\nspecial repayment conditions for disabled students will\nbe given, despite four amendments made to the\nStudent Loans Bill by the House of Lords.\nThe bill passed through Parliament on Monday and\nnow awaits the formality of a Royal Assent. The bill\nhas made its journey largely unaltered with the four\namendments overturned by the Commons. Two of\nthese amendments applied to the continuation of\nhousing benefit for students. Any alterations are now\nup to the Government which promises to add an\namendment allowing the Education secretary to award\nprovisions to disabled students as he saw fit.\nThe Department of Education and Science\nannounced its intention last month to increase student\nsupport funds by \u00a310 million, which they claim is to\naid students in financial difficulties, particularly those\nliving in high ac como dati on cost areas.\nWard closures at St Mary's Hospital starting on 4th August and lasting until 1st September, and possibly\nfurther closures for 2 weeks in the winter will lead\nto the postponement of all non-emergency operations\nin the hospital. There are claims that this could badly\naffect teaching.\nNeil Goodwin, General Manager of the hospital said\nthat the move was expected to save \u00a3400,000. The\nhospital has been set a savings target of \u00a32 million\nfor next year, with a budget of \u00a350 million. He said\nthat clinical a citi v ty had increased by 20 percent in\nthe last three years, but that the cutbacks would not\naffect the teaching of students in the adjoining Medical\nSchool.\nA spokesperson for St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool said that the closure would affect teaching as\nstudents are taught all year round, though the\nspokesperson admitted that as the budget had been\noverrun, 'nothing can be done'.\nTheft\nOne of the two computers stolen from the Mechanical\nEngineering Department before the Easter vacation\n(Felix 865) has been recovered. Two men have been\narrested in connection with the theft.\nThe editor of last year's Felix, Mr Bill Goodwin, was\nfined \u00a35000 plus costs for contempt of court this\nEaster. The House of Lords, the final appeal court\nin the country, decided that Mr Goodwin was acting\nillegally in not handing over documents to the court\nwhich could reveal the source some of his\ninformation.\nDave Peacock, the Union Manager, and Toby Jones\nof Elec.

    "content": "DEP. PRESIDENT Spenser Lane proposed by S. Parkus\nSpenser has a strong personality which is competent,\nimaginative, and compromising. He has been involved\nwith countless student activities, and previous\nresponsibilities have included representing his year on\nthe staff-student academic affairs committee,\nassistant manager at ICR, and external secretary of\nWellsoc. This year, his work as SCC HJT has been\noutstanding, with his likeable and understanding\nnature enabling club treasurers to learn the new\nprocedures. Above all, Spenser is hardworking,\napproachable & the most responsible person for DP.\nS. Parkus (SCC Chair)\nI aim to introduce fresh ideas benefiting student\nfinances and welfare, whilst upholding personal safety\nand liberties. Its all very well being vociferous, but I aim to enact student views.\nBETTER SECURITY:- I will take precautions to\nrapidly decrease the theft and violent crime occur ing in College, and press College to accept their\nresponsibilities for student safety in halls.\nresponsible for ensuring better off-campus services\nby writing to shops in Kensington (eg Tower Records)\nto negotiate discounts for IC students, and lias e with\nULU to start campaigning for student rates on London\nTransport.\nBETTER UNION OUTLETS:- In light of increasing\ninflation and decreasing student finances, I will\nendeavour to make union establishments the most\neconomical for students. And for committees that I chair, to bring in new ideas gained from working\nexternally in bars, bookshops, and catering\ncompanies.\nBETTER TIMETABLING:- Before the new academic\nyear starts, I will check all student timetables to stop\nillegal timetabling.\nBETTER SABBATICAL:- As a member of the exec,\nI will ensure that student views are heard at all\nrelevant levels and that action is taken.\nBETTER EXTERNAL SERVICES:- I will be KEEP SMILING-FRESH IDEAS FOR A FRESH UNION.\nDEP. PRESIDENT\nWith four years at I.C. behind me I can honestly say\nthat I have had enough experience of the college and\nthe union to be able to do the job of DP effectively.\nGood working relationships with several of the people\nthat I will have to deal with, if elected, already exist.\nThey will make my job easier and allow me to devote\nmore time to you, the cuddly student populace (don't be too sick).\nWithout wanting to appear egotistical, I feel that I am simply the best suited candidate for the job.\nWhy?Because of my ability to get along with people-this is surely a prerequisite of being a sabbatical.\nBecause I have no blatant union 'pedigree' but\nknow what goes on.\nBecause I have no bias towards or against any\nparticular group\nBecause I am an efficient administrator without\nbeing too supercilious\nI am a serious and committed contender for this post.\nIf elected I will simply do my best for the union and\nyou.\nGraham Littler proposed by Doug King\nBefore I finish I'd like to say this. At a time when\nthe Rector doesn't accept that your Union is\nrepresentative of student opinion perhaps it wouldn't hurt if as many of you as possible voted. Whoever you\nvote for doesn't really matter, though obviously I'd prefer you to vote for me. Every vote will be for IC\nUnion so please support the only representation you\nhave.\nDEP. PRESIDENT Benjamin Turner proposed by Dave Osborne\nin four years at Imperial College, Benjamin has been\nheavily involved with student life. He is the Athletic\nClubs Committee Chairman, was the Captain of a successful sports team and has made invaluable\ncontributions to Union Council and Finance\nCommittee. He represents Imperial College externally\nas Vice-Chairman of the Southern Universities Athletic\nUnion.\nAll those Union members who have had contact\nwith Benjamin admire him for his efficiency and\nefforts. Following the last election, the Felix Editor\ndescribed him as 'the best Deputy President candidate\nfor a long time.'\nI hope that you will agree with me and vote\nBenjamin Turner 1.\nDave Osborne.\nThe Deputy President is responsible for a turnover of\nover \u00a32 million. You must choose a candidate who\nwill be able to manage this business. I have the\nbackground and ambitions to do this, and have ideas\nfor development and expansion of the Union's facilities. These include adding new outlets,\npreventing the closing of the Snack Bar and\ndeveloping it into a complement to the Union Bar, and\nturning the Ents Lounge into a facility students want\nto visit during lunchtimes.\nI intend to reduce the emphasis on the Union's management sub-committee structure where time is\nwasted on petty issues-this will allow trading outlet\nmanagers to get on with what they are good at.\nI will tighten up the security of the Union Building and\nthe personal security of students attending functions.\nI want to see Harlington reinstated fully and\ndeveloped for letting out to clubs when students are\nnot using the ground. Proposals for a Health Suite and\na Sports Hall in Princes Gardens are being discussed,\nand I want to see these instigated for general student\nuse.\nTo support future development plans, vote for our\nrepresentatives in the forthcoming Council Elections.\n\n"

    "content": "Ideal Holmes?\nDear Dave,\nIn FELIX issue 865, the last issue before the Easter\nbreak, a letter from Craig Holmes (ME3) was printed.\nIn this letter Mr Holmes wrote at length about his\nopinions on the CCUs and made several wild\ncomments about their role in IC. We found this letter\nworrying to say the least and would like to point out\nthat most of the information was incorrect.\nThe CCUs do have a real role to play in Imperial\nCollege and between them provide academic\nrepresentation, many social events, the Balls, sports\nand social clubs and activities for ALL students at the\nCollege. Examples of the different ways in which the\nCCUs represent their students include the campaign\nby Guilds to protect the ACGI, the letter writing\ncampaign by the RCS on the loans issue and the\nMines' Foreign Students' Week. Next year this role\nwill be strengthened as fire regulations are forcing us\nto hold the Freshers' Reception on a Constituent\nCollege basis.\nThe student officers (the 'hacks') work hard to\nensure that the CCUs run smoothly. This is no mean\ntask when trying to keep up with a degree. Most\nofficers give up their lunchtimes and many evenings\nto do this work and from personal experience, the\nCCU presidents often spend over 30 hours a week on\nUnion business.\nCheap motors\nDear Dave,\nI am curious to know how Mr Holmes arrived at his\nfigure of \u00a35,000 a year budget for each of the CCU's motorised mascots (FELIX 865, page 31 refers). The\nbudget I have for the renovation and upkeep of\nClementine is about \u00a31,500 this year and I know that\nboth Bo and Jez receive a grant which is similar in\nvalue to Clem's( in fact less) \u00a3 5 , 0 0 0 is easily more\nthan all three of our budgets put together.\nIt is not just Rag which warrants the ownership of\nour vehicles. Many people take immense pleasure\nfrom being involved with the upkeep of Clem, Bo, Jez\nand Derrick (and have done for the past 30 or so years\nClem and Jez have been at IC and the 55 years that\nBo has been here). In this respect, the three motor\nclubs are no different from any other IC society. Why\nshould those students have to finance their particular\ninterest, especially as they frequently spend their own\nfree time (and often money) preparing the vehicles for\nevents that will raise money for Rag? I suggest that\nnobody is going to join a society if they have to pay\nfor everything themselves and certainly far fewer\npeople would be involved in raising money for Rag if\nthey had to pay all to do that. The mascots provide\nan excellent means of representing the College to the\nOf course some students take up union posts for\nCV points. This is true for any club or society and is\nalmost impossible to prevent. What surprises us is\nthat Mr Holmes wrote his letter in spite of the fact\nthat he is the Mech Eng Society Chairman and\ntherefore an officer of Guilds with direct input into\nhow the unions runs its affairs. During this year Mech\nEng Soc has gone from being one of the most active\ndepartmental societies in IC to having virtually no\nactivities. The only event which we are aware of was\nthe 'Revue' which was organised by a group of\nstudents who were not aware that Mech Eng Soc\nexisted. We hope that one of the organisers will have\nthe strength of character to rebuild the Society next\nyear.\nHopefully Mr Holmes' letter will stimulate interest\nin the CCUs. If you want to know what they offer then\nvisit one of the CCU offices any lunchtime and ask-do not rely on secondhand information! May we finish\nby reminding Mr Holmes that people in glasshouse s shouldn't throw stones.\nYours,\nChris Home, President C& GU\nRob Row, President RSMU\nCarol Luscombe, President RCSU\nRhydian Hapgood, President SMHMSSU.\npublic both in charity raising events and other College\nactivities.\nMr Holmes also appears to have a misconception\nabout the owners of the mascots. They are not the\nCollege's, they are not ICU's; they belong to the\nstudents of their respective CCUs. If they were sold\n(or self-financing) the money raised wouldn't go\nanywhere near getting a new careers librarian, it\nwould just go back into the Union to fund another\nUnion activity.\nIf you take away the motorised mascots you are not\njust losing four old vehicles you are taking away an\nexcellent means of collecting for Rag, you are taking\naway part of the history of the students at IC and an\nopportunity to be involved, as a student, with\nveteran/vintage vehicles, an opportunity unique to IC\nand one which will most probably not occur again\nafter leaving College. In short, you are losing a valuable asset to the students of the CCUs. After all\nisn't it part of your education to be able to be involved\nin activities which you will never have the chance to\ndo when you enter the working world?\nYours sincerely,\nStephen Laing,\nCaptain of the RSM Motor Club.\nDay nursery rebuttal\nDear Dave,\nAs the parent of a child in the Day Nursery and as\nthe non-academic staff parent representative on the\nDay Nursery Comittee which advises on the running\nof the Nursery, I should like to take issue with your\nheadline 'Day nursery is a health hazard' which topped\nthe article on page three of the last edition (21.3.90).\nThe information contained in your article does not\njustify this headline. As your article itself states, the\nNursery passes safety checks frequently and complies\nwith all the necessary Health and Safety regulations.\nIt therefore is not a health hazard. Your headline only\nreflects the sensation-mongering attitude prevalent in\nthe tabloid newspapers and is not good journalism.\nYour article consists of unconfirmed reports and\nclaims which the headline presents as fact. If you had\nbothered actually to do some proper research for the\narticle you would have discovered that the real picture\nis very far from that presented in your story. Our\nchildren play happily in the good conditions provided\nby the Nursery. They do not sleep on mattresses on\nthe floor, but on special folding cots and are cared for\nby people who deserve more than to have the\ncorrections they would have made to this article\nignored.\nVours sincerely,\nSaskia Daniel, Registry.\nSee editorial for reply.\nSmall Ads ADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUNCMENTS\n\u2022 Juggling; interested in JugSoc?

    "content": "The Union\nSometimes I despair of this College's student union.\nDeputy President, Dave Williams summarised his\nposition quite clearly this week. He said that the Union\nSnack Bar did not need any bad publicity. He argued\nthat the students should not be told how much money\nthe snack bar is losing, in case it d is u ades them from\neating there. I believe that the food in the union snack\nbar is now both good value and good quality. I also\nbelieve that students have a right to know if it is losing\na lot of money. The snack bar is owned by the\nstudents who constitute the union, and as\n'shareholders' they should be told of its financial\npredicament.\nDave has written a report in this issue which is really\na PR exercise. He seems happy to mention the\npredicted surplus for college bars as \u00a360-70k, whilst\nfailing to mention how the union's bar has performed.\nHe makes no mention of the snack bar losses.\nThe Deputy President's job is not one of Public\nRelations, it is one of management. At the beginning\nof this year, Dave blamed a large part of the snack\nbar losses upon the incompetence of his predecessor.\nAfter two terms, this is no longer credible. Although\nthe changeover to a sandwich bar style outlet has\nbeen a success, the snack bar is still operating at a deficit. The union does not, and should not, have any\nintention of closing the snack bar. It does not have\nany clear plans or ideas for combating the deficit\neither. When we asked Dave Wiliams for projected\nlosses for the snack bar, he said there weren't any.\nThis is an atrocious state of affairs. The union employs\na finance officer and a business manager, and yet it\nstill does not ask them to compile projected losses and\nprofits for its outlets. Mr Williams is running outlets\nfor which he has no plans it seems. The sad matter\nis that if the union snack bar continues to make a loss,\nthe people who stand to lose their jobs are the\npermanent staff, not the sabbaticals, who will leave\nat the end of June.\nElections\nYou have a chance to do something about the snack\nbar losses by voting in the election for Deputy\nPresident. Do not pick someone who is likely to spend\nthe first part of the year blaming his predecessor for\nthe faults in the union, vote for someone likely to\nknuckle down and rectify the situation. This may be\nthe last chance you will have to save your snack bar.\nIf we have another poor DP, the outlet will be run into\nthe ground, along with its staff.\nLocal Council\nHaving complained about the union, I should like to\npraise it for standing candidates in the local council\nelections. The idea is a simple but good one, which\nTom Yates and Neil McCluskey have worked very\nhard on over the Easter. Please vote in the elections,\nand don't forget, you must mark the paper with a X, rather than a number in the local council elections.\nThe Day Nursery\nI give up! All of the information contained in the news\nstory in issue 866 was obtained from staff working\nin the day nursery. I refute Saskia Daniel's closing\ncomments with this very point. As for the letter from\nthe parents of children in the day nursery, what a waste of ink. The letter only repeated the points raised\nin the original article and was signed by, amongst\nothers, the very person who came to FELIX\ncomplaining at the state of the day nursery. (I would\nadd that he is also the bore from whom Paul Shanley\nand Neil McCluskey fled through the window of the\nFELIX Office.)\nStaff Meeting\nThere will be a staff meeting on Tuesday at 1pm in\nthe FELIX Office.\nCredits\nFirstly, good luck to everyone taking exams at the\nmoment.

    "content": "Go fly a kite\n*^ by Mike Tarry\nHaving been involved with the Hang Gliding scene for\nthe last three years I have watched the increase in\npopularity of para gliding with both interest and\nconcern. The latter results from the inevitable\nswamping of 'our' sites by 'them', those lucky\nbuggers who each time they fly down to the bottom\nof the hill only have to carry 3kgs of sailcloth back\nto the top, whilst we struggle under 30kgs of glider.\nThere's no prizes for guessing who sweats the most!\nThis weekend the former of these two factors got the\nbetter of me, so I paid my \u00a3 3 5 for a one-day hang\nglider to para glider con vers on, and off I went in the\ndirection of the South Downs (W Sussex).\nMy instructor was the same guy the IC Club has\nbeen using to teach our members to hang glide for the\nlast few years (with no accidents so far!), ex-SAS, ex-mercenary, easy-going Eddie Bilous-CFI Free Flight\nHang Gliding School.\nSaturday started with blue skies, and I started at\nthe bottom of the hill learning how to 'ground-handle'\n24 square metres of sailcloth\u2014possibly the hardest\npart of this new sport. As the temperature crept up\nto 22\u00b0CI slowly crept up the hill, ten feet per flight,\nalways under the watchful eye of Eddie. Eventually\nI found myself at the top of the hill. Helmet, harness,\ncheck the risers (strings), airspace clear, tug the front\nrisers, CRACKI-the canopy inflates above me,\nquickly onto the breaks, check inflation, canopy\nstable, breaks off, run to the edge. 10m,20m,30 m,50m the ground drops away beneath me. Below,\npeople shrink from six feet tall to the same number\nof centimetres. Unfortunately I fly out of the lifting\nair from the hill, and sail down to the ground. People\nbegin to grow back to their normal size. The grass gets\nnearer-feet together, prog re sive pull down on the\nbreaks, and my toes touch the ground with less force\nthan jumping off a2ft wall. If only hang-gliding had\nbeen this easy!\nSeveral flights later the day ended with me being\nawarded my F1, the first licence (of three) which says\nI'm not a complete n utter with kama kaz i tendencies.\nSunday started much the same-blue skies and a gentle up-slope breeze. Today was a day for\nconverting onto a higher performance glider-the\nmuch talked about (in these circles anyway) ALIEN.\nThe increase in performance was stunning, and with\nthis beauty I ended up right down the bottom of the\nvalley. In fact I was so impressed, 'I bought the\ncompany'. Actually I didn't, but I did place an order\nfor an ALIEN of my own, and at \u00a31,300 a time shows\njust how much fun para gliding is.\nThe IC Hang Gliding Club still has some training\nmoney left in its account, and anyone interested in\njoining the club and possibly getting sub sidi sed tuition\nonto paragliders had better get in on the act soon,\nbecause I can see all our \u00a3\u00a3's disappearing quickly.\nEddie will be available for training throughout the\nEaster break, and will take you any day of the week,\nbut will especially love to see you on weekdays. He\ncharges \u00a335 a day and unless you've got a good few\nhours flying hang-gliders, it'll take more than a day\nto get your F1.\nSince para gliding has only been around for about\na year, no club exists at IC (to my knowledge), and\nno club has the relevant equipment. I shall be talking\nto RCC to see if we can raise any money to buy a suitable canopy, but we'll have to wait and see.\nIf you want to have a go, here's how to do it.\n1. Call Eddie the night before you want to go. Mention\nmy name, that you're from Imperial and want to learn\nhow to fly a para glider. If you intend going down by\ntrain, tell him to collect you at Portslade (between\n9.30 and 9.45am) the next morning. His number is\n0273 411239 and it's best to call between 6.00 and\n7.00pm to catch him in.\n2. The trains go from London Victoria to Hove (then\nto Brighton) at 8.20am everyday. Get off at Hove\n(9.23am) and change onto the west-bound train\n(9.28am) which goes through Portslade (and onto\nWorthing).\n3. Eddie will pick you up in a small light blue Bedford\nvan at 9.30am with hang-gliders on top of it.\n4. To get back to London follow the reverse process.\nYou should be back in the smoke by 8pm.5. If you want any chance of a subsidy from the\nUnion, get a receipt off Eddie on something that looks\nrather more like a receipt than an old chocolate bar\nwrapper.\nI can see a great future in para gliding. It's a fantastic\nsport. If you want any more information my home\nnumber is 01-352 4007, or get in contact via the Aero\n3 pigeonholes.\nSo put those books down, for a few days, forget\nexams and 'sky out'. It's the best high I 've had for\na very long time. Good luck and happy flying.\nMike Tarry, ICHGC Chairman.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Cutting\ncomment\nDear Dave,\nIt has come to my attention that Nick Blades has\nwritten to FELIX regarding my involvement in the table\nwetting incident at the Diggers Dinner. I am afraid I cannot deny my involvement as a key character in the\nscenario that led up to an individual urinating on the\ntable. I must point out that it would appear Mr Blades'\nmemory has also become clouded. For Mr Blades has\nunfortunately got the sequence of events somewhat\nmuddled and it would appear that he also mis heard the challenge that I laid down to the incontinent\nindividual. I was merely asking him to recount a story\nof his revolting behaviour. I do not blame either of\nthem for mi shearing my request as it was very difficult\nto hear anything at the time as most of the room was\neither goading me into removing my underwear or\npleading with me to put my legs away and not make\na speech.\nThe whole incident was very embarrassing and\nunpleasant and I must hold myself partly to blame. I feel it is rather unfair of the Union to ban a group of\nindividuals in a case where the actual culprits, and in\nthat I include myself, are so easily identifiable.\nThe Union has carefully outlined disciplinary\nprocedure that should have been used. Is Mr Blades\naware that the Diggers are entitled to appeal against\na decision? I feel that they should, as it seems\nunreasonable that Diggers cannot hold a dinner again\nwhilst the individual concerned could attend, for\nexam ble, his Rugby Club dinner next week and behave\nin the same manner.\nWhatever might be determined as fair and\nreasonable punishment in the end I believe a good one\nmight be to make the table wetter wear a large nappy\nfor the whole of next year's Rag Week and collect\nmoney for a charity related to people with bladder\nproblems!!\nYours sincerely,\nSydney Harbour-Bridge.\nPain\nO 'Polltax\nDear Sir,\nI was walking past Southside Bar the other day\nwhen I was shocked to see a poster saying 'Pay no\nPoll Tax!' I wondered if the Union knew this?\nThe poster belongs to Haringey Anti-Poll Tax Group.\nIt is not surprising that Haringey has an anti-poll tax\ngroup, because they have the highest Community\nCharge in the country. This is because the council\nwastes money on such 'worthy' causes as 'Gay black\nlesbian babies against the bomb'. If this council was\nmore efficient, like Wandsworth or Westminster, they\ntoo would have a Community Charge of under \u00a3200.\nBack to my original question. Does the Union know\nabout this poster? if it doesn't, may I suggest that they\nget it taken down because the Community Charge is\nfair and just and everyone should pay it.\nIt is not for any person or Union to encourage others\nto break the law, and if the Union do know about this,\nwhat law-breaking activity will they advocate next?\n'Mug the elderly', perhaps or even 'A Murder a Day\nKeeps the Doctor Away'. Where will it end?\nYours,\nAlan Bailey, Chem.\nPoll cat\nDear Dave,\nIn the last issue of FELIX a member of the\nConservative Society in the difficult position of\ndefending the in defens able poll tax chose to deride\nthe use of a local income tax (LIT) to fund local\ngovernment. How can it be unfair to ask people to pay\nfor local services based on their ability to pay? Whilst\nI agree that people who pay nothing towards rates had\nnothing to lose from electing a high spending council,\nthere are more equitable means of getting\ncontributions. Why is it that when I leave Imperial I shall pay just over 3% of my income in poll tax, whilst\nmy sister will have to give up over 10% of hers? Does\nthe Conservative ethos really run like this: graduates\netc work harder by getting their 17 year-old sisters\n(and pensioner grandparents) to pay their contribution\nto local services. Well I shall not further take up\nreaders' time discussing a tax system which shall fade\naway like the Prime Minister who introduced it.\nHowever, whilst the whole argument of local\ngovernment funding is under question I would like to\nmake the point that poll taxes, roof taxes, and floor\ntaxes are unworkable and very often unfair. The crux\nof the matter is that we do not all have the same\nincomes. LIT-is nothing new, it has been used in\nPhiladelphia since 1939 and other States in the US\nas well as Sweden, Japan and Denmark. So I wonder\nhow long it will take the other two parties to borrow\nthis piece of Liberal Democrat policy?\nRegards,\nAndrew M Waller.\nNo more!\nDear Dave,\nI hate to harp on about the 'Asian Soc Issue' but\nI think Mr Bartendu Vyas' letter of last term (FELIX\n865) deserved an honest reply.\nI am a 'real' member of Asian Soc and I have no\nconnection with either Mr Vyas or Anil Loadwa\n(whoever he/she may be) so I cannot really comment\non Mr Loadwa's letter, but Mr Vyas' was in parts\nalmost laughable.\nTo quote Mr Vyas 'Election papers for every post\nincluding president for this year's committee (89/90)\nwere put up on November 27 and every member of\nthe Society was informed of the exact time and place\nof the elections about two weeks prior to this!'\nI do not know where exactly these posters were put\nup but I certainly did not see or even hear about them.\nAnd to suggest every member was informed of this\nevent is downright annoying, considering I got a leaflet\nin my pigeonhole two weeks after the event informing\nme of it and telling me that 'my vote is important' and\nthat it is essential I attend. (With publicity like this no\nwonder Mr Vyas was voted in President!)\nAnd that leaflet I hasten to add is the only thing I have ever received from Asian Soc after joining (I know the internal mail system is bad but it can't be\nthat bad!!) where has my \u00a31.50 gone?\nBut I do have to admit that at least Asian Soc wrote\nto me telling me where and when I could give them\nmy money, I mean 'join', which is more than India Soc\ndid.\nI signed up at the Freshers' Fair and have heard\nnothing from them since.\nYours,\nA1 st year who doesn't give a damn anymore if\nAsian/India Soc write to them.\nName withheld by request.\nNo more correspondence on this please-Ed.\n'Sausage'\naward\nDear Dave,\nI am disgusted by the attitude the College\ndemonstrates in applying for an award for export\nachievement for its teaching and research work. The\nannouncement that we have won an award is not\ncause for celebration, but cause for deep worry as to\nthe motivation of the College authorities.\nThe attitude this award demonstrates is that the\nCollege sees overseas students (and probably\nstudents in general) as a product, in just the same way\nthat Bowyers sausages are a product, and the export\nof an 'educated' student after receipt of fees is the\nequivalent of shipping a crate of these sausages\nabroad. The same is also true of College's attitude to\nresearch.\nThe award, says the press release, is due to the\nincreased earnings the College is receiving from\noverseas students and collaborators. It says nothing\nabout the quality of this export commodity, nor how\nwell the students coped or were treated during their\ntime here. The students are not people they are boxes,\nand to make more money you must ship more boxes.\nIt is therefore not surprising that complaints from\noverseas students about their treatment are on the\nincrease. I saw plenty of these as Post Graduate\nOfficer last year, and have seen other problems much\ncloser to hand. As the College says, there are 'no\ndegrees for sale here' (yet) but there are certainly\nplaces for sale, and once here a foreign student is\noften left to sink or swim with little or no support from\ndepartment, lecturers or supervisors.\nAnd there is another side to the coin. In their\ncontinuing desire for 'export income' the standards\nfor entrance of foreign students to the College seems\nto be dropping. The tales of 'simultaneous\ntranslations' from English to Chinese in Computing\nlectures, and my own experience with some\nundergraduates clearly demonstrates that the College\nis not applying suitable entry standards in spoken\nEnglish.\nThe reason people come here, and the reason that\nIC graduates are in demand is not because of the\nquality of the current product. It is because of the\nquality of the IC product over the past 10 or 20 years.\nThis reputation is currently being strip-mined by\nCollege to boost student numbers, and thereby,\nincrease short term income and 'profits'. Doing this\nat the same time as reducing the staffing level will\ninevitably lower our standards and shatter our\nreputation. It is time that the Rector, academics,\nstudents and governors started looking after the long\nterm interests of IC. There must be new appointments\nof young, innovative lecturers to replace those lured\naway to America and Oxbridge. Students from\noverseas must be selected on quality, not ability to\npay, and must be given adequate, if not excellent,\nsupport while at the College. The same is really true\nof home students as well, and every effort should be\nmade to reduce the costs to all students of studying\nat IC, rather than having them milked by the\nrefectories and residences (and in some cases by the\nUnion as well).\nIn some areas IC's reputation is slipping already.\nUnless some action is taken soon, we may merge with\nRHBNC in ten years time with our science\ndepartments in as poor a state as theirs.\nDave Clements, Physics RA, PGAO 88-89.\nPage 19\n\n"

    "content": "ADVERTISEMENT FEATURE\nHow to win elections and\ninfluence people\nJOHN FINLEY X CHRIS OWEN KEN YOUNG PAULA YOUNG\nYou should have your poll card soon, if not already.\nYou will also have had your poll tax demand. You must\nhave seen the posters about the elections for the local\nCouncil. What are you going to do come polling day,\non May 3rd? Well, you could turn out and vote. To forestall\nquestions about this, consider the following thoughts.\nWhy will my councillor do me any good? The local\nCouncil directs the expenditure of the very large sum\nof money raised from personal poll tax, business rate\npoll tax and the Rate Support Grant. This adds up to\na significant fraction of a billion pounds a year, and\napart from blanket services like refuse collection,\nstudents (who pay like everyone else] see surprisingly\nlittle of it. Whether this is because the local Council\nnever gets to hear our views, or actually doesn't want\nto, is unanswerable. But whichever block exists, it\ncould be removed by direct representation.\nPlanning and licensing are also dealt with by the\nlocal Council, and if you've ever been annoyed by your\nhall's inability to get a bar, or your inability to get a hall place because there aren't enough, then you\nmight think about getting yourself a voice. We don't claim that a couple of councillors will work miracles\novernight, but do you know whether people spoke on\nyour behalf the last time a planning application was\nconsidered? Or whether they were heard if they did?\nA couple of local Councillors dedicated to putting over\nthe world according to Imperial College could help a lot. Who should I vote for? ICU has got it's finger out\nand assembled a team of candidates for the two\nwards with most students in them:\nKnightsbridge Ward, Westminster (all of Prince's Gardens, Montpelier and Beit) and Courtfield Ward,\nKensington and Chelsea (Evelyn Gardens).\nKnightsbridge will be contested by Dr. John Finley\n(Aero. Eng., Warden, Beit Hall) and Dr. Chris Owen\n(Space Physics, Sub Warden, FK Hall), and Courtfield\nwill be contested by Ken (Warden, Southwell Hall) and\nPaula Young. Candidates were selected primarily on\nthe basis of their record of working for students, as\nwell as ability to communicate and put their point\nacross.\nWhat are they standing as?\nThey are all standing as IC Party candidates, which\nwill be abbreviated to ICP on the ballot papers. Many\npeople ask why they should vote for an independent\ncandidate, when a party candidate will at least have\nhis or her fellow party councillors' votes. This is true,\nbut the only way a party with a majority on a Council\ncan get things done is to ensure consensus between\nall members before the Council meets, then require\nall members to vote with the agreed result. And when\nthey're talking about the various issues that the\nCouncil will discuss, how high on the agenda do you\nthink the problems of IC students will come? The only\nway to get a particular voice to the level of the Council\nmeeting is to have a candidate who specifically stands\nfor that voice. There are other independents, but a vote for them loses the backing of a party vote\nwithout increasing their voice on your behalf-if\nanything, it decreases it, because even independents\nstand on platforms dedicated to a particular group,\nand if you're not within that group it may be hard to\nget your councillor's ear. The bottom line is that party\npolitical votes have always been wasted at local\nCouncil level, because nothing the local Council can\nsay or do will affect policy coming down from\nWestminster. The wise vote in local elections has\nalways gone to whichever candidate seems to be able\nto do most for you; we hope that the choice is clear\nfor you.\nWhen, where and how can I vote?\nPolling is from 8am to 9pm on Thursday, May 3rd. If\nyou're in Prince's Gardens, Montpelier and Beit you\ncan vote at Linstead Hall, and if you're in Evelyn\nGardens, you can vote in the Armenian Church on the\ncorner of Cranleigh Gardens and Evelyn Gardens. You\ndon't need your poll card to vote, but it makes it\nquicker if you do have it on you. You also have several\nvotes; two if you're in Westminster and three in\nKensington and Chelsea. In Westminster we ask you\nto cast those for John Finley and Chris Owen, in\nKensington & Chelsea to cast two for Ken and Paula\nYoung and to withhold the third - any use of the third\nvote will make it harder for Ken and Paula to get in.\nYou can vote on the way into college or the way\nhome, it takes only five minutes, and it could be the\nbest spent five minutes that day.\nWhy me?\nPrimarily, why not? You've had to pay for your vote,\nyou may as well use it. But also, we don't have a huge\nvoting base in college. Certainly, if all students turn\nout and vote ICP then we should be able to swing the\nelection our way; but it's a close run thing even if you\nALL turn out, so we need every eligible student to\nappear on the day and cast their vote for ICP. Really,\nseriously, every single student, or the day is lost. Any\nfurther questions? Please feel free to address enquiries\nor comments to ICU (internal 3500). But if your\nquestions have been answered, then please vote IC\nParty X on May 3rd Published by Neil McCluskey and Tom Yates (Imperial\nCollege Union, SW7 2AZ) "

    "content": "Deputy President\nTerm Planners\nHopefully everyone has picked up a term planner this\nweek. They are a fairly new venture, both IC Union\nand the production company are testing the water this\nterm and we hope to extend the project next year. As\nsuch any feedback would be very useful.\nBar\nI am sorry that the bar had to close over Easter but\nthe manager desperately needed a holiday and it was\nonly fair. We are still trying to recruit an assistant for\nhim. I have every confidence that the bar and snack\nbar should be able to remain open during the summer\nvacation.\nOver Easter prices went up in all College bars due\nto the Budget price increases. The College bars are\nkeen to implement a further price increase to cover\na forthcoming wage increase, however considering\nthe level of surplus that the College bars are projecting\nthis year \u00a360-70k(a30% increase on last year) I believe that the prices should be held as they are.\nAlthough it is yet to be confirmed, it should be possible\nfor the Union Bar to hold with just Budgetry price\nSnack Bar\nThe new 'freshly-made-sandwich' project in the snack\nbar is meeting with overwhelming approval. They are\ncertainly the tastiest food in College (a far cry from\nthe carpet burgers in QT!). Queues are sometimes a problem but why not come during a free period or\nbetween lectures, the sandwiches will remain fresh\nuntil at least late afternoon. For those of you sick of\nthe stale, noisy atmosphere of the MDH or QT sitting\nout in the sunshine in Beit Quad makes for a pleasant\nsummery change. What could be better than a fresh\nbut ty, a cold beer and an afternoon of sunshine?\nBookstore\nRecently the bookstore half-year accounts were\nreceived by the Bookstore committee. The figures\nshowed that the heavy investment made by the Union\nlast year are beginning to pay off. It will be a couple\nof years before we see a sizable real return but it is\nin a much healthier condition. An area for expansion\nwe are considering is a student stand-by ticket office:\nseats would be available from 10am the day of the\nperformance. We are also starting a mail order\nprogramme to sell alumni t shirts, ties, etc. Feed back\non these ideas would be appreciated.\nUnion Building\nThis summer will see a large re decoration programme\ncovering the top floor of the Union Building and a refit of the Concert Hall. This will finish a four year\nprogramme of renovation/re decoration which means\nit will be time to start again. I am constantly\ndisheartened by the level of simple-minded vandalism\nwhich takes place in the Union. Toilet lock, internal\nwindows and toilet fittings all become targets; is this\nreally the behaviour to be expected from a population\nwith an IQ of 140 + ? The state of repair of the Building\nreflects on you the student and how outside visitors\nperceive Imperial College. The cost of repair is also\nreflected in the cost of beer, the cost of food and how\nmuch clubs and societies are sub sidi sed. Academic Affairs\nIn the last issue of FELIX a considerable degree of\ndisquiet was expressed by 3rd year students in\nBiochem. Investigation on that specific issue has\nresulted in a promise of a change in the allocation\nprocedure for next year, but that does bugger all for\nthe people this year.\nThe more people I speak to, who have experience\nof the Biochem department tell me of feelings of\ndespair, at the lack of concern for the feelings of\nundergraduates. Most express dismay at their sense\nof abandonment which the academics within the\ndepartment leave them with.\nIt is time the department started giving a damn\nabout its students, time it started a structured tutorial\nprogramme instead of the sham that exists at the\nmoment and time that proper consideration was given\nto timetable consideration in the whole of the Life\nSciences.\nDave Williams, ICU Deputy President.\nThere are only a few things this term in the Rag\nTimetable: Firstly if we can get the people together\nwe will be running the casino at tonight's Carnival,\nif not enough people are interested it won't happen.\nThe only 'big' Rag event in May is the 'traditional' Rag\nFete.\nThis was previously on May 12 but unfortunately\nthere are several problems with this date (mainly it\nclashes with several other things). May 12 is also the\nLukeamia Research London flag day so if we could get\na decent group of collectors we could probably raise\nmore money for less hassle doing this. So anybody\nwith any views on the subject please turn up to the\nRag meeting today (12.35pm) in the Union Loungeagain if nobody shows any interest nothing will\nhappen and no money will be raised.\nHal Calamvokis, Rag Chair.\nULU Lesbian and Gay\nThanks to a very active committee, last term saw a varied and full programme of events for the ULU\nLesbian and Gay Society, which included 15 speakers,\n4 videos, 2 trips and a partridge in a pear tree.\nThe videos we saw were: Jubilee, Derek Jarman's portrayal of a future Britain where anarchy and pop\nrule; Law of Desire a Spanish film about a gay director;\nHairspray, a John Walter comedy attacking 50s American racial segregation and showing you don't have to be anorexic to have fun or go out with the\nlead actor; and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a comedy\nwith Steve Martin and Michael Caine (not all the films\nseen have a message).\nMixed in with these videos were various speaker\nmeetings: Paul Hegarty came from the bookshop\nGay's the Word to tell us about the problems his shop\nencountered when trying to import a number of\nAmerican books. A couple of weeks later, Derek\nJarman, director of films such as Carravagio and\nPage 14\nJubilee, spoke about his life, work and living near a nuclear power station. A group of five men who are\nliving together in a polygamous relationship came to\ntell us about how such a relationship keeps going, their\nbasic philosophy of life and who does the washing up.\nSpeakers representing the four main political parties\n(Conservative, Labour, SLD and Green) came to speak\nabout the future of lesbian and gay rights in Britain.\nWe also had a discussion about Haringey's 'Positive\nImages Campaign' by a Conservative councillor and\nprospective Labour councillor from the area. The\ngroup also went out for an Indian meal, and to a lesbian and gay disco at City University.\nNext term's events will include a talk about safer\nsex. A gay Christian and humanist will discuss what\nthe Bible has to say about homosexuality. Hopefully\none of the producers of Channel 4's 'Out on Tuesday'\nand Matthew Parris (former Conservative MP and TV\npresenter) will both come to speak to us. Various\nvideos will undoubtedly be shown (subject to what\nis in the video shop) and there will probably be a group\nmeal and party towards the end of term.\nThe meetings usually start with either a video or\nspeakers, followed by drinks and a chat. The society\nis open to all, students and non-students, lesbians,\ngays, bisexuals or anyone. We meet from 7.30pm on\nWednesday evening in the University of London Union\nbuilding in Malet Street\u2014the room is advertised in the\nbuilding on the right, as you enter. To enter the\nbuilding either have your ULU card, or say you have\ncome for the lesbian and gay society, and the\nstewards will let you in.\nFor more information either go to one of the\nmeetings or write to Gaysoc Pigeonhole, ULU, Malet\nStreet, London WC1E 7HY or ring Peter Brent on\nextension 6705.\n\n"

    "content": "Film\nA ShortFilm Monsieur Hire\nAbout Love\nThis film is of the type sometimes referred to as a 'study'. That means that the plot, such as it is, is not\nthe main point of the film. It is the characters and the\nfilm's observations that matter. Filmed in Polish, it has\nEnglish subtitles, but for once I found that the sense\nof detachment added to the film. Aptly, we are\nstudying the characters from a distance.\nTomek, a young post office worker, has been\nspying on Magda, a thirty year old woman in the block\nof flats opposite, for over a year. He phones her up\nwithout speaking, sends round gas men when she\nbrings home boyfriends and intercepts her mail. When\none of her many men leaves her crying over spilt milk,\nhe finally confronts her and tells her what he's done.\nAt first she dismisses him violently but finally they\nmeet in her apartment...\nAt first, the film revolves around Tomek. We see\nMagda only through his telescope-the audience\nthemselves become the voyeurs. The only sounds we\nhear are from the boy's apartment-the only sounds\nthat reach us from the woman's apartment are her\nvoice on the telephone when he phones her,\notherwise she inhabits a silent world. This enforces\nthe feeling that they are completely separated,\nmut u tally incompatible.\nIt is to prove this to him that Magda leads Tomek\nto her apartment. She maintains that he cannot be in\nlove with her as love does not exist, just biological\nreactions. She can make love but can not be in love.\nTomek as her opposite, cannot take the place of her\nother men and flees her. She is both right and wrong.\nLove is a biological reaction, but what are we but\nanimals dependent on love, as necessary as food and\nas crippling if not sated?\nAs the film draws to an end, neither happy nor sad,\nwe feel no emotion towards either Tomek, a pathetic\nif disgusting figure or Magda, acd ld, manipulative\nwoman. Perhaps this is to show that there can be no\nfeeling after all.\nIf you go to this film just because it is an 18, you'll\nbe disappointed. I think this signifies that anyone\nyounger wouldn't understand this film (there's no car\nchase). I'm not sure I understand it consciously\nmyself, yet it touched on something that made me\nsad. A personal film.\nToby Jones.\nSociety would class M. Hire as a pervert. He has a conviction for indecent exposure and spends his\nevenings watching the girl in the flat opposite through\nhis window. He is hated by his neighbours, but he\ndoesn't care. He is a man who prefers silence and\nsolitude. Then one evening he sees something happen\nin Alice's room that will change his life...\nMade by a Frenchman whose past films have in\ngeneral tended towards comedy, it is a dark and\ndisturbing film. M. Hire lives in a room into which light\nrarely falls. He never switches on the light and spends\nhis evenings indulging in his voyeuristic tendencies to\na background of Brahms. Alice lives in a lighter, airier\nenvironment and lives a fairly normal life - if you ignore\nthe fact that her fiancee is a criminal. Slowly the two\nbegin to merge, we see new facets of the characters\nand our perceptions begin to change. The plot is\nsimple, the pace is slow but the developments\nintriguing.\nMichel Blanc's portrayal of M. Hire is perfect,\nbringing across the necessary elements of both threat\nand despair that are inherent in the character, while\nleaving him as a human, albeit an unusual one. Alice\nis less well portrayed, her emotions and motivations\nnever becoming clear. It is difficult to tell though,\nwhether this is a failing of the actress (Sandrine\nBonnaire) or of the script.\nThe few other characters in the film have little in\nthe way of personality - they are merely devices to\nallow plot development. The film is primarily one of\nrelationships, but fails on one simple count. One\ncannot feel any sympathy for (or empathy with) either\nof the central characters. The viewer is always the\noutsider looking in on a situation that is of little\nrelevance to his/her life. Thus while it provides an\ninteresting 80 mins it has little lasting appeal.\nAdam T. Film\nThe Hunt for Red October\nBefore the USSR began to crumble, the naval games\nwhich continue today were played out with fleets of\nsimilar ships and subs. Stalemate. But what would\nhave happened if one side had discovered a silent\npropulsion system? A devastating first strike would\nbe possible. But what if the commander of the first\nsub to be fitted with this major advantage decided to\nsteal it?\nMarkus Ramius (Sean Connery) does just that. He\nsteals the Red October, the Soviet's latest submarine,\nand sails it towards America. Strangely he informs his\nsuperiors as to his intent and they deploy everything\nto get him back or blow him up.\nBack in the USA, VIA analyst Jack Ryan (Alec\nBaldwin) is called upon to brief senior Whitehouse\nofficials on the latest sub technology and to explain\nthe strange behaviour of the Soviet Fleet. He decides\nthat Ramius is trying to defect. If he is right, the\nAmercans will have their hands on the latest\ntechnology. If he is wrong...Someone must intercept\nRamius and learn his true intent. Good old,\nexpendable, Jack Ryan.\nEven though we live in a post-glasnost era, this\nthriller hits the mark. Connery plays Ramius with ice\nin his veins contrasting with the eager but\ninexperienced Ryan played well by Baldwin. Crew\nmembers on the UPS Dallas are all played by authentic\nNavy sub mariners giving a touch of reality to the\nfaithfully copied sets.\nAs for the underwater effects, Industrial Light &\nMagic used a combination of smoke and computer\ngraphics and a500 foot model of the Red October.\nAs expected, they are superb and seem perfectly\nnatural.\nDirector John McTiernan {Die Hard) has kept up the\nsuspense throughout, only letting us relax for some\nwisecracks. You can tell how keyed up everyone is\nwhen a quite funny joke gets a huge response from\nthe audience. It's quite a long film at two hours\nsixteen minutes but I certainly didn't notice.\nQuite simply, a film that I urge you to see as much\nas I did Black Rain.\nToby Jones.\nPage 4\n\n"

I think I can listen and be human',\nhe said. He added that he thought the\ncollege needed a voice in the local council,\nbut though there were potential problems\nin being a local councillor as well as his\ntwo other posts there would probably be\nno clash of interests. This is because most\nof the council meetings were at about\n6.00pm and, he said, 'being a warden is\nnot very time consuming .... one just has\nto be available'. Dr Finley said he had\nbeen at the college for 23 years.\nNeil McCluskey, President of IC\nUnion, was asked by Felix to comment on\nthe candidature. He said 'read the article'\nand yawned. In the article he says that if\nall the students at IC vote for 'the IC party'\nthe candidates will have a very good\nchance of winning.

He explained that he thought the\nSnack Bar had attained the 'right formula'.\nIt no longer sells tasteless food and now\nper sues a 'dynamic' approach he said.\nMr Williams added that the union\nintends to advertise the facility to attract\nnew customers.\nDave Peacock, Union Manager, said\nthat there was 'no chance' of the Snack\nbar being closed, and again blamed the\ndeficit on a low turnover. ICU President,\nNeil McCluskey told Felix that the idea\nwas 'a load of bollocks as far as I'm concerned.'\nMr Williams claimed that there was no\nofficial projection for the deficit of the\nSnack Bar at the end of this year. The\nUnion has put \u00a330,000 into the Snack Bar\nover the last three to four years to keep\nit afloat.

    "content": "The friends of Tito\nby Craig Kenny\nLong before the astonishing changes in Eastern\nEurope, Yugoslavia had a reputation for being the\nmost liberal of these states. Signs of this were\neverywhere: shops full of food, fashionable clothes,\ngraffiti and even pornography in the newspapers. The\nonly shortage I noted was of the famous bread\nqueues. There is also a burgeoning tourist industry,\nbringing in hard foreign currency. They need it:\ninflation runs at a crippling 2,000%. To give you some\nidea, 20,000 Dinar is worth just 40p! If you want a room, take some dollars, sterling or marks. And\nthough you don't need a wheelbarrow for your\nYugoslavian notes, a big, fat wallet helps.\nLoadsamoney indeed!\nThe political situation is far from idyllic, as ethnic\nviolence and Serbian nationalism blight this beautiful\ncountry; a nation fabricated after the Great War from\nvarious Balkan states, formerly of the old AustroHungarian empire. On the walls, one slogan persists:\nand accordingly dull. Undeterred by this, the good\ncitizens would travel miles out of their way to lead us\nto places we were looking for, taking us to bars on\nthe way and trying to teach me their impossible\ntongue. Most young people spoke some English,\nwhich surprised me, as I had been warned that only\nGerman (and Russian) was in common usage in the\nEastern Bloc. But youth culture, we must remember,\nis written in American.\nOur next destination was Yugoslavia's Adriatic\ncoast and the magnificent medieval walled town of\nDubrovnik. En route, the train was suddenly stormed\nby hoard es of chanting youths, who packed into the\ncars. Expecting something like the xenophobia of a Newcastle United supporters club outing, my\ncompanion and I sat in tactful silence by the window.\nThe young boy next to me offered me a cigarette. 'We\nare going to join the army', he explained. 'This is very\nexciting for us'. The natives were friendly, but mad,\nat the darkness.\nThe next morning they were gone. In their place\nwas a student, who wanted to know if we were\nAmericans. His way out of the monotony of life and\nunemployment was to be a steward on an ocean liner\nin the Carribean. He was highly critical of the Yugoslav\neconomy and the country's leaders, though he\nconfessed to know no remedy. Then he said\nsomething that would make a cold war-monger's ears\nprick up. 'Have you read any Lenin-The Dialectic of\nNature'?', he asked, betraying his education.\n'Didn't Engels write that?', I said, betraying mine.\nHe seemed delighted and began to argue philosophy\nwith me, always cosier than politics.\nMost young Yugoslavians were desperate to see\nsomething of the world. Unlike me, they weren't full\nof questions about what life was like under a different\npolitical system: they only wanted the freedom to go\nand see for themselves. As is the case in most of\n- ^mmm n1 mini\nit \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 Hil ill lili ill lil 'Duge Tito' which means 'friends of Tito' someone\nexplained to me. Most Yugoslavians see their present\ndifficulties as beginning after his death and he remains\na genuinely popular figure. Every shop seems to bear\nhis portrait, frowning serenely, or flashing his superbly\nwhite teeth. I took this at first for an enforced\npersonality cult (as was true of the then living\nCeausescu), but soon realised that he stands as a unifying figure in a deeply divided country. Tito was\nno Gandhi-ruthlessly massacre ing thousands of\nopponents after the war-but he still seems to have\nfriends.\nThe people of Zagreb are perhaps the kindest in\nSouth-East Europe. Despite its exotic name, it is a clean modern city somewhat in the German mould,\nI decided. A young French traveller decided to speak\nup for la libert e. 'How can you say this', she protested,\n'the army is about killing. They treat you badly. If there\nwas a war we would have to kill each other.'\n'Yes', the lad agreed, a budding Svejk if I ever knew\none. 'But we get to see places we haven't seen\nbefore. Then we must return after a year to our towns\nto work and probably won't travel again for a long\ntime.'\nThe army satisfied their curiosity for travel. Better\nwatch it, I thought, since armies don't usually take\nkindly to Wanderlust. So we shared cigarettes and\nbottles of water with the six green conscripts\nthroughout the hot Mediterranian night. At every\nstation, they would lean out of the window and wave\nEastern Europe now, these restrictions are no longer\nBureaucratic, but financial. My steward friend had\nbeen lucky: one girl told me her father earned the\nequivalent of just \u00a360 a month. They wanted to see\nand to be there, not just read about it in newspapers,\neven if what was printed was more truthful now. Just\nlike young Europeans, and you can't argue with that.\nThe next day we caught a coach to Dubrovnik;\njewel of the Adriatic, a beautiful resort, maybe too\nbeautiful to make interesting reading.\nCraig Kenny.\nPage 13\n\n"

Kenneth\nBryliantine, the minister responsible for stapling\ntogether the original Green Paper, to explain.\n'Firstly, fundamentally, fore mostly and principally\nlet me first say this. It is not, I repeat not, a 'Poll Tax'.\nIt is the Community Charge and it's the best thing\nsince sliced bread.\n'Indeed, like sliced bread, the Community Charge\nmay have been ridiculed at first, but it will be\naccepted. I repeat, it will be accepted and I will repeat\nthis repeatedly until you accept the inherent\nacceptability of the scheme, OK. I mean, why should\nyou eat a thin, pasty and overpriced socialist loaf\nwhen the Conservatives can provide a chunky\nwhole meal loaf at a fraction of the cost. And it's better for your health!\n'So why, if the Poll Charge is so wonderful, are\npeople rioting in the streets about it. I will tell you,\nthis tiny minority, a couple of millions at most, have\nbeen mislead by the evil, yes that's the word, evil left\nwingers in the press.\n'I believe that the BBC has deliberately ignored all\nthe thousands of pro Community Tax meetings which,\nI'm sure, have been happening throughout this great\ncountry of ours.

This distortion\nof the truth is typical of the kind of thing one would\nexpect from the Guardian and the rest of the REAL\ngutter press.\n'And let me just say this. If Labour had tried to\nintroduce the Community Charge when they were in\ngovernment, in real terms, they would have been\nmuch less efficient than us, which just proves my\npoint.\n'Listen to me, do not believe those few million\nanarchists and Militant readers, who quite deliberately\nset out to burn all those Porches and smash all those\nwindows of all those nice shops, while pretending to\nhold a peaceful demonstration. Something must be\ndone.\n'I personally myself have been in favour of the\nscheme since I was first told to be and you all should\nbe too.

    "content": "Our day\nnursery is not a health hazard\nDear Sir,\nRE: Day Nursery is a health hazard (FELIX 865)\nAs parents of the children who are currently\nattending the Day Nursery we were absolutely\nappalled by today's front page article purporting to be\nan accurate description of the conditions in the\nNursery. The Day Nursery is NOT a health hazard.\n1. The Nursery premises are maintained by the\nCollege and any necessary repairs are carried out as\nsoon as is practicable.\n2. Any infestations by insects are dealt with\nimmediately. Since the building is old this is not\nunusual and regular visits are made by Rentokil to\navoid any possible health problems.\n3. The amount and type of space provided for the\nchildren has been approved for their use and is\nconsidered adequate by the local authority which\nlicenses the Nursery.\n4. Those children which have a sleep in the\nafternoon do not sleep on mattresses on the floor but\non small camp beds in an area which was approved\nfor that use on the recommendation of the local\nauthority day-care adviser.\n5. The fact that the children go to sleep soon after\ntheir lunch is perfectly normal for active young\nchildren as they are all between the ages of 18 months\nand three years.\n6. The staffing levels are above that required by the\nlocal authority and the Nurse-in-charge has a supernumerary post to cover staff sickness etc.\n7. During the lunch break half the staff are always\npresent in the Nursery.\n8. As you observed there are adequate fire exits and\nthe Nursery can be evacuated in three minutes\nconsiderably quicker than most buildings could be.\n9. The parents already spend considerable time and\neffort in fundraising to buy the necessary books, toys\nand equipment and consider that painting the\npremises is the job of the College authorities as it is\ntheir building.\nWe would agree that the premises are not ideal and\nare not up to the palatial standards of some modern\nworkplace Nurseries which benefit from the\nemployers being able to sub sid is e the costs. However\nour children are very happy and are looked after by\na dedicated band of Nursery nurses who could quite\neasily get far better paid jobs elsewhere.\nIn the meantime inaccurate articles such as yours\ndo not help the Nursery in its constant battle to stay\nsolvent by putting off prospective parents of children\nwho might otherwise have considered sending them\nto it.\nBy all means start a campaign to re-locate the\nNursery, we would support you all the way, but please\nget your facts right before you start.\nYours sincerely,\nAnn Maconnachie, Mech Eng; K Rudlin, Residences;\nJ Dowley, Lyon-Playfair Library; A Curley, Elec Eng;\nS Daniel, Registry; B Costello, Chem Eng; S des Clers,\nEnv Tech; S Essery, Life Sci; I Malsanda, Min Res Eng;\nNizam, Civ Eng; C Boey, Maths; C Pantelides, Chem\nEng; J Kilner, Mats; CLowe, Biochem; P McDermott,\nQueen's Gate; J Pretty, Civ Eng.\nSee Editorial for reply.\nEaster\nrip off\nDear Dave,\nToday a notice was put up by the Housekeeper of\nSouthside, informing all students to return the Easter\nVacation forms stating if they required\naccommodation or luggage storage facilities over the\nEaster period. There is no objection to requesting\nstudents to do the above; the part which I found\noffensive, was that which informed students that if\nthey did not return their forms it would be assumed\nthat they would be staying in their rooms over the\nvacation! This I believe is in contradiction to the\ncontracts that we all filled out before taking up\nresidence in October. The reason, I believe, that we\nhave been told to return the forms, is so College can\nmake money out of students who do not give in\ncompleted forms. These residents assumed the same\nprocedure as at Christmas would be followed. This\nmoney will contribute to bailing College out of its\nfinancial diff icu lites( re. accommodation deficit).\nFrom para' 35 of the College 'Terms and Conditions\nof Residential Lettings, 1989 ed' it says that the\nstudent must leave when the letting has terminated,\nunless alternative arrangements have been made. The\nperiods of letting s are, as from the yellow contract,\nbox F, as quoted below:\n'Noon Saturday 30.9.89 to Noon Saturday 16.12.89\nNoon Saturday 6.1.90 to Noon Saturday 24.3.90\nNoon Saturday 21.4.90 to Noon Saturday 23.6.90'\nFrom this it can be seen that the note posted to the\nstudents is in violation of the above contracted letting\nperiods. Therefore the College can not bill students\nfor the Easter period unless the student has\nspecifically requested to stay for the Easter vacation.\nI would therefore like College to not bill students\nwho do not return forms concerning residence over\nthe Easter period. This letter has been circulated to\nthe Rector, Prof G New, Miss LO 'Callaghan, Mr RL Chandler, Miss K Rudlin, Falcon and FELIX.\nYours sincerely,\nS S West, RSMU AAO.\nMore\nhack-biting\nDear Dave,\nAfter my hack-baiting letter in the last issue, it has\ncome to my attention that I made an error regarding\nthe sums of money for running their inviolate mascots.\nI admit my error and I apologise most humbly for it.\nInstead of the \u00a35,000 per vehicle that I originally\nquoted, I should have said that both Jez and Bo each\nget about \u00a31,200, and Clem (the Mines-mobile) has\na budget of \u00a31,500. The extra money being used to\ncover the extensive overhaul that Clem is receiving\nat present.\nHowever, despite my error, the points that I made\nabout the CCU's still stand and I do not apologise for\nthose. I would like to say as a final note on the subject\nthat some good has come out of the last letter. I have\nheard on the grapevine that there has been some\npositive interaction between the CCUs, and that they\nhave actually agreed with each other about\nsomething...THEY DON'T LIKE ME VERY MUCH.\nYours, in exile,\nCraig Holmes, 3M. Having a dig\nDear Dave,\nRE: Banning of Diggers Club from Union Facilities\nI was rather shocked today when I read your article\nabout this year's Diggers Dinner.\nThe dinner took place on a Thursday and not a Friday. One member of the Club did vomit on the table\nafter one spoonful of his starter.\nYour reporting of the incident involving Mr HarbourBridge was inaccurate and I feel your informant may\nhave had his/her memory clouded somewhat.\nMr Harbour-Bridge was initiated into the Club that\nnight. He removed his shirt (as must any new initiate)\nand then proceeded to drop his trousers and boxer\nshorts, before downing his pint with cons u mate ease.\nHe then made a fatal mistake. He challenged one of\nthe more vocal members of the club to be more\ndisgusting than himself (as he produced his dick for\nall to see). It was then that the urinating incident\noccured.\nYour article failed to point out that we cleared up\nafter the dinner so that the UDH was in pris teen condition. Mr M Williamson (Duty Officer for the\nevening) said that the condition of the UDH\nafterwards was totally satisfactory.\nOne of the catering staff commented that 'this\ndinner wasn't as bad as RSM's'.I hardly think the\nUnion will be in a hurry to ban them.\nI was rather surprised that the Union has not written\nto me regarding the incident. I would have been\nprepared to come and discuss the events of the\nevening with the Union officers.\nHowever, having to hear of their decision through\nFELIX was inconsiderate to say the least. In the last\nfew years the Union has consistently shown a negative attitude towards social clubs and I think this\narticle confirms this.\nDiggers was formed 14 years ago (when most of\nthe Union officers were playing conker s in the school\nplayground). It has maintained a consistently active\nrole within the hall and the clubs' members help out\nconsiderably with the smooth running of Southwell\nHalls' social events.\nYours, ready for a DIG,\nNick Blades, President Diggers Club 89/90.\nRed & cross\nSir,\nA Bailey misses the entire point of my letter,\nhowever, that is'his problem. I will take him to task\non his statement 'Patients are dying every day due\nto the ambulance men withdrawing their labour'. This\nis a gross insult to all the Army, Police, Red Cross and\nSt John's Ambulance units who attended over\n13,000 calls in the Chelsea area alone whilst the LAS\ncrews were locked out of their place of work. Perhaps\nhe/she could furnish me with details of how many\npeople died who otherwise wouldn't have?\nBy the way the College Ambulance did 1,200 road\nhours and 2,600 man hours service and attended to\nover 600 patients during the dispute. The 'Imperial\nCollege Ambulance Fund' is to raise \u00a320,000 for a new vehicle as the existing one is now 17 years old.\nYours, with 240 hours voluntary ambulance\nservice,\nMr Nicholas Royall, Geology.\n\n"

    "content": "Film\nBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\nFirst, the conclusion. If you want to see a film make\na fool of itself and at the same time have a good laugh,\nthis is that film.\nI had to put the conclusion first in case you didn't make it through the review. Quite simply this is an\neveryday story of two young idiots who want to form\na band. Unfortunately they can't sing nor play the\nguitar. This doesn't stop them, however, from\nbecoming a new cult religion that everyone looks up\nto...if they pass tomorrow's history test that is.\nThis is where Rufus comes in. He comes from the\nfuture to ensure that they pass (otherwise civilisation\nas he knows it disappears). He gives them the ultimate\ncheat sheet, a time-travelling phone box (sounds\nfamiliar?).\nOur two 'dudes' take off into the past. From\nAncient Greece to the Wild West they kidnap all sorts\nof people and bring them back to modern day\nAmerican to see the sights and to help with their\nhistory presentation.\nOf course, things get predictably out of control, as\nJoan of Arc takes over an aerobics demonstration and\nNapoleon eats his way through a bowl of icecream.\nWhat can I say about this film? It's so ludicrous that\nit grows on you: I think that the ending is a bit too\nlong and some of the gags were repeated too many\ntimes. The device 'If tomorrow I go back in time I can\nget us out of this situation' was amusing once but\nthree times in succession?\nTheatre\nPericles\nA question mark-l kid you not-learned historians\nsee this play as barely Shakespeare. Indeed if the\ngreat bard new the RSC's Pericles I'm sure he too\nwould wish to disassociate himself from it. As usual\nwith the RSC, no expense is spared; costumes are\nextravagant and the set innovative. The RSC\nsquanders technical expertise on a script ten times\nmore tedious than Neighbours but given the full\nHamlet treatment. The company with few exceptions\nthrew itself whole-hearted ly into some really a bism al 'ham' Shakespearean acting. Pericles is very\nmiserable.\nAnna Teeman.\nStill, most of it is funny, and the effects are pretty\ngood. I just wonder how they got the two heroes to\nbe so dumb? As a complete mickey-take of time\ntravelling teen adventures, this wins first (or last)\nprize.\nDon't forget 'Be excellent to each other'\nToby Jones.\nUncle Buck\nFilm\nBuck Russell, played by John Candy, is a carefree\nbachelor who uses any excuse he can not to do any\nwork. In fact, if it wasn't for his brother asking him\nto look after his nephew and two nieces for a few\ndays, he might have had to work for his girlfriend\n(Amy Madigan). That was close. He drives to his\nbrother's in the moving trash-heap he calls a car and\nwakes all the neighbours. Uncle Buck is the last\nperson you'd want as a baby-sitter but he pulls\nthrough admirably.\nAt first he has some trouble with the house and\nkids, for a start he can't remember their names! The\nnephew, Miles Russell, assaults him with the longest,\nquickest running question session before accepting\nBuck as a role model. The youngest niece, Maizy,\nthinks he's cuddly and the elder niece, Tia, thinks he's a slob. This is not surprising as his eating habits put\nmine to shame! Have you ever seen a six foot pancake\nbefore?\nAs Tia tries to avoid him, Buck takes special care\nto look after her. This makes her hate him even more,\nespecially when he insists on driving her to college in\nhis wonderful car. Tia's boyfriend, Bug (he's that type\nof guy that makes you wonder what she sees in him),\ntries to interfere 'Ever heard of a tune up?', 'Ever heard\nof ritual killing?' comes the reply before a cloud of\nsmoke covers Buck's exit.\nAll the charades are well cast, especially Macaulay\nCulkin as the eight year-old Miles. He's a likable kid\nwho has some great lines. When Buck comments on\nMiles noticing the hairs in his nose, he replies 'I'm a kid. That's my job'.\nMostly though the humour comes from John\nCandy. No one else could have 'filled' the character\nas he does. He has the sort of humour you either can't get enough of or find a bit tiresome. I thoroughly\nenjoyed it. Any film that can make ME start to shed\na tear must be worth watching!\nToby Jones.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Sailing Challenge\nThe Imperial College European Sailing Challenge\n(ICESC), with six members from IC, went to France\nand competed in the Spi Dauphinne Regatta over\nEaster. The idea of the regatta being each team\nconsists of two boats, one sailed by the university\nstudents, and the other by the team sponsor. The\nICESC had two main sponsors, Symbol MSI, a High\nTech company, and Sema Graph, a CAD Engineering\nfirm, as well as sub-sponsorship from IC, Douglas Gill\nand DPSC International.\nThe team quickly earned a good reputation with the\nrace organisation. In fact, after Rory Barrett and Pierre\nGrosgogeat free-climbed a55 foot mast to pose for\nthe cameras, the ICESC was voted best\nrepresentative for their sponsors in the regatta, by Le\nFigaro the biggest French national newspaper.\nConditions varied greatly, with winds between 0 and\n60 knots. The race was tremendously well organised\nwith a night race, a24 hour relay race, one day race\nand one Olympic race. Conditions were perfect giving\neverything from roaring 16 knot spinnaker runs, to\ncritical light wind beating.\nNext year the syndicate hopes to raise more than\nthe \u00a315,000 it was worth this year, and is aiming to\nwin the Spi Dauphine 1991.\nEastern Orienteering YHA\nEaster is a vacation for orienteering. This year we\nwent to Southampton to run the British Student\nChampionship, and to Scotland to run an international\nevent.\nIn Southampton it was more important to enjoy\nyourself than to win. But we did win something,\nShaun West got the wooden spoon (after spending\nover 7 hours in the forest!) and again we won the boat\nrace-this time by the girls.\nThe weather was on our side, and most of us\nmanaged to get sunburnt after two days running.\nDuring the Easter weekend we ran in Perth in\nScotland, competing with national stars from Norway,\nSweden and the UK. William Power did the best run,\nending up as number 7 in his course after being 2nd the first day. This was really good, with the hard\ncompetition and the difficult orienteering. Both Dave\nKnight and William Power had good runs for the men's first team in the relay, but they couldn't take up the\nhard Scandinavian competition.\nIC Rifle and Pistol\nbeat Holland Club\nAt the end of last term we shot a combined rifle and\npistol match against the Holland Club. Rifle and pistol\nshooters from each club were paired according to\nability and then shot against the corresponding pair\nfrom the other club. The winner was taken to be the\nclub who won the most pairs.\nICR&PC Pairs\nS Cane 195\nR Hambleton 194\nS Taylor 193\nLachlan 182\nT Griffiths 179\nA Menzies 176\nT Griffiths 175\nJ Hurr 171\nS Taylor 166\nR Hambleton 158\nHolland Club pairs\nRifle\nN Royal 193\nS Turner 181\nC Raves 180\nP Woods 168\nW Bodinksi 167\nPistol\nP Hems 185\nJ Pilner 176\nN Royall 171\nC Raves 163\nV Brashko 163\nSo ICR&PC won 4 pairs and the Holland Club won 1\npair meaning that ICR&PC won the match, although\nthe aggregate scores were quite close (1750-1789).\nCould all members of the club please note that this\nterm the range will only be open on Wednesday and\nSaturday afternoons as we have to do at least a couple of hours revision before our exams.\nThe cold morning started with a bowl ful of porridge\nand a dash of treacle (we feeble s assen ach s couldn't take the traditional salted porridge). Then the\ndiscussion of where to walk today. After the fun job\ngroups soon emerged; those who were going on the\nlong walk, and those going on the short one.\nThe long walk was a fifteen mile one around a fractal coastline. As fate would have it, this included\ncrossing a raging torrent. One member of the group\nthought he had found the perfect route but suddenly,\nhe was neck deep and being swept into shark-infested\nwaters (a little ex age ration perhaps, really it was a gentle stream, he was waist deep, and the waters\nwere infested with seals).\nThe short walk actually remained on the beach and\nturned into a 'beach bum' party. This included such\ndelights as throwing stones at other stones, attacking\neach other with pieces of seaweed, and (of course),\ntaking in the atmosphere of the Misty Isle. We did\nhave our exercise of the day, though -the 200ft walk\nback to the van was uphill!\nAt the end of the day, after the evening meal of\nhag g is and swedes/potatoes, it was off to the pub to\ndiscuss the day's exertions over a glass (or two) of\nthe local whisky, Talisker.\nAll in all, a pretty successful day in our 10-day trip\nto the Misty Isle. I can't wait for next year's Easter\ntrip.\nPage 8\n\n"

    "content": "Intrepid FELIX reporters Tony Drambuie and Ed de Menthe reveal details of the recent govern me on a potentially secret projectile launching system...\ni Queen's Tower in\nsatellite scandal\nOver Easter the Queen's Tower, Imperial College's prestigious symbol of fertility, has been seized. HM\ncustoms, acting upon classified information to the\neffect that QT was to be a new military satellite\nlauncher, took control and pronounced a20 metre\nexclusion zone around it. Following delays in both the\nAmerican and European space programmes potential\nwas seen for a reliable and cheap land based launcher\nfor satellites and other projectiles. Government\nexperts are thought to believe QT a prime candidate\nwith its good road and rail links, discreet location and\nfast access to Europa Foods.\nThe government agency MIS has had Imperial under\nclose scrutiny since the appearance of a giant 'candle'\nsome 16 months ago. Under the pretext that this\nwould be built and lit in order to raise money for\ncharity, it is supposed in fact to be a scaled down\nprototype for the, now possibly installed, system in\nQT. FELIX has obtained confidential blueprints of the\ndesign when the tube was at tat ched to the side of\nthe Mechanical Engineering building. This\nexperimental version was used to test access for\nsatellite or cargo loading and determine the length of\nthe fuse for detonation, known under the codename\n'wick'. Apparently a consortium, the British Unilateral\nLauncher of Low-orbit Satellites and High Industrial\nTechnology, has so far provided funds for such a costly venture. This is composed of several industrial\nconcerns, the Temms Water Authority and the\nrecently formed IRC for Missile and Bomb curious\npeople. The Baron of Cheapskate was unwilling to\ncomment on the matter.\nA potential carcinogen and dangerous poison, Cadmium, is still commonly used for household pr\nManufacturers will have to decrease levels to remain environmentally friendly in the '90s rep\nKhoroushi.\nHeavy metal\nThe concern over the presence of heavy metals really\nstarted after the Second World War, because of\naccidents occurring in, for example, Minamata, Japan\nand the better understanding of their effect on man's health and his environment. Cadmium occurs\nnaturally, but as ever the problem starts when man\nand industry are involved with its manufacture.\nCadmium is generated during zinc manufacture\neither as a by-product or a fraction of the waste. Over\nthe past 40 years cadmium has been used as surface-coatings, pigments, in rechargeable batteries,\nstabilizers in PVC as well as detergents and fertilisers.\nIn all these areas substitutes are available, but\ncadmium with its high stability and resistance to heat,\ncold and light seems to be the ideal choice for the\nmanufacturers. With detergents and fertilisers\ncadmium occurs as an impurity in phosphate rock\nformations. This heavy metal is removed during the\nproduction of detergents but not fertilisers.\nCadmium can get into the ecosystem via air, water\nand soil. It moves through the environment and is\nfinally deposited in the soil, where it is taken up by\nplants and enters the food chain. Over the years\nemissions of cadmium into air and water have been\ncontrolled but now this leaves food as the major\nsource of exposure to the general public.\nThe environmental impact of cadmium is not\nsignificant and so efforts have been concentrated on\nprotecting man. Cadmium accumulates in the kidney\nand if its concentration rises above 200 parts per\nmillion then it can cause damage to organs and lead\nto chemical complications. The United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency considers cadmium\noxides as a potential carcinogen, but they are still\nprevalent in working environments. Studies have\nshown that cadmium does not influence the health of\ncattle or their milk. There might be a problem with\nsheep as they eat large amounts of soil, but this has\nnot been studied yet. Plants on the other hand take\nup cadmium through the soil. The acidity of the soil\nis important, as the more acid the soil the more\ncadmium is taken up. The type of vegetable is also\nimportant. Lettuce and spinach take up more\ncadmium than cabbage, cauliflower and beans.\nSmoking and poor health both increase susceptibility\nto the effects of cadmium.\nThe Acceptable Daily Intake level for cadmium is\n400 micrograms per day, while in Britain the average\ndaily intake is about 140 micrograms. However this\nintake level is increasing all the time. Another factor\nis that cadmium concentration is usually 2 to 3 times\nhigher in the home. Therefore any control programme\nhas to involve lowering emissions, as well as the use\nof cadmium in products. The EEC directive bans the\nuse of cadmium in many plastic products, as\nstabilise rs and plating of metallic plants and\nequipment. The aim of the ruling is to make companies\nseek alternatives to cadmium.\nA few manufacturers (mainly European] have\nstarted to decrease the levels of cadmium in their\nproducts, although Britain seems to be lagging behind.\nWith 1992 approaching the companies substituting\ncadmium are bound to be in a much more favourable\nmarket position as well as being regarding as\nenvironmentally or maybe it is more appropriate to say\nhumanly, friendly.\nShadi Khoroushi, Life Science 3.\nPage 7\n\n"
