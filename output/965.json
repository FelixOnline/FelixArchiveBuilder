Oh yes, it is the last\nImperial College Hockey Report of\nthe year. An opportunity to tell all\nyou lovely people about our\nexploits.\nFor the record, here are the\nfigures:\nP32 W13 D4 D15 F60 A71\nHenry Ford is reputed to have\nsaid, satisfies are bunk. Disguised\nunder that seemingly innocuous set\nof numbers hides a most amazing\nfact. For the first time since who\nknows when, Imperial College\nMen's1st XI Hockey team won\nsomething. The University of\nLondon Cup is our proud\npossession, or at least it shall be\nwhen they get around to giving it\nto us (only two months late).\nAs well as being the highlight of\nour year, the Cup run was the\ngolden strand sown through the\nseason. Our victims to reach the\nfinal included Kings College, who\nwe hadn't beaten since anyone\ncould remember, and a very tight\ngame against the Medic types of\nUMDS. In those games we played\nas well as any IC team I 've seen in\nthree years. The final of course was\nthe marshmallow fairy astride our\nvictory cake. Royal Holloway had\nhumiliated us pre t tv regularly in\nU AU and London League fixtures\nover the years. 5-1 had been a popular score as well. Yet despite\ntheir training schedules and rolling\nsubstitutes, we made short work of\nthem scoring three goals in ten\nfrantic minutes. Final score 3-1.\nThe other parts of the season\nwere workmanlike; an equal\nmixture of good and bad. Hari-Kari\nwas the order of the day in the\nU AU. After credible performances\nagainst Reading, Brunei and Kings,\nwe threw it all away losing to\nCharing Cross on grass in a game\nwhere we weren't sure who was\nplaying where. The London League\nlooked good for a time, until we\nplayed an out of form UCL side and\nlost 5-3. The four counties Saturday\nLeague produced many a laugh but\nlittle in the way of results.\nMemorable amongst the former\nwere the forgetfulness of a certain\ngoalkeeper and a bad succession of\n9 man teams. In the end we did\nabout as well as usual coming 11th of 15 teams. League reorganisation\nOn a dull and overcast Wednesday\nmorning, the IC Cricket 2nd XI set\nout to Harlington to play Kings\nCollege in the Commercial Union\nU AU Championships. Eventually\nthe opposition arrived and the toss\nwas taken, which IC lost and Kings\nelected to bat.\nThe wicket proved treacherous\nfor the opening pair but they\nbravely batted on with ball after ball\nflying past their ears. Eventually\nKings got a breakthrough by\ndismissing Mustafa Hussain off a good length ball. This signalled the\narrival of the Man-of-the-Match\nSteve Blythe who smashed his\nsecond delivery for a glorious 6 and\nwent onto score an impressive 66.\nEveryone contributed to the\neventual score of 194 (not a bad\neffort on such a wicket).\nBy the time Kings came to bat,\nthe sun had come out and the pitch\nhad dried. The opposition had an air\nof confidence about them but they\nhad not counted on the lightning\npace of our opening bowlers. Manni\nManimaara and Zulfi Hassan.\nManni took a wicket in just the 2nd over off one of the worst balls you\nare ever likely to see. However with\ncontinued tight bowling the visitors\nwere struggling, well below the\nrequired run-rate, by tea.\nOn resumption, fine bowling\nspells from Jawwad Darr, Dave\nPhillips and Ed Holme signalled\ntrouble for Kings. With only 6\novers to go 60 runs were required\nand only 1 wicket remained. Off the\nbowling of Ed the last batsman got\nan outside edge which sent the ball\nso high that it almost went into\norbit. Running backwards Stuart\nHill pulled off an amazing one-handed catch securing victory for\nIC. We had lost the toss but had\nstuffed the opposition by 57 runs.\nThis was an impressive start to the\nseason with fine team performance\nand some notable ones by certain\nindividuals.\nWell done to everyone and here's to many more victories and many\nmore jugs of beer!\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE CRICKET CLUB\nFIXTURES 1993\nDate H/A Opponents Type Team\nSun 8 May H RHBNC UAU 1st/2 nd Wed 12 May A Royal Free F1 st Sat 15 May FA Cup Final\nSun 16 May A Surrey Uni 2nd XI F2 nd Wed 19 May H QMWC UL Cup 1st Wed 19 May H St Mary's2 nd XI F2 nd Sat 22 May\nWed 26 May A St Mary'sF1 st Wed 2 June H St Bartolomews F1 st Sat 5 June A Sussex Uni F1 st/2 nd Wed 9 June H St Georges F1 st Sat 12 June A London Hospital 2nd F2 nd Sun 13 June A LSE F1 st Wed 16 June A Surrey Uni F1 st means we might go down.\nStill in a year that started out\nbeing a 'Help!

A tall\ndark fellow introduced himself to\n-me with the words 'Good show old\nboy, the name's Bija; what do the\nchaps call you?'. He explained he\nwas a Sri Lankan, where English\nteachers had been trained by the\nprevious generation of British\nschools and so still taught 'King's English'. He pointed out a chestnut-haired lad known to everybody as\nthe 'Crazy Git'. Unfortunately,\nCrazy Git wandered over next and\nstuck out a hand, saying 'Morton's the name, and womens my game.'\nWe hastily got rid of him, and asked\na passing Japanese student his\nname. 'Ah, Tetuso, that's what they\ncall me. They call me that because\nit my name.' he grinned. A tall,\nthin, scruffy boy eating a malted\nloaf came up and offered us some.\n'Hello' he said. 'I'm Adrain. I won\nthe 'Nice Guy' Award of the BornAgain Communists, and I just want\nto tell you that some of my best\nfriends are brown. He was followed\nby another thin lad wearing\nspectacles who asked 'Do you have\n7 A's at A Leyel? My name's Gordon.'\nI was beginning to wonder if I was the only graduate around and\nstarted to ask if there were any\nothers. One girl glared at me and\ngrudgingly admitted 'yes' in a thick\nAmerican accent. Her name was\nMarian.\nWe all soon found ourselves\nfacing our first human dissections.\nI had expected the odd person to\nfaint or feel sick, but instead we all\nstarted to hack and slash in a very\nbusinesslike manner. With only one\n'corpse' per eight students, only\ntwo or three could mutilate away at\nany one time, leaving the others to\nwander around, ogling each other's dead bodies and talk. I encountered\na vertically-challenged but\ndetermined girl engrossed in greasy\nhuman entrails. ' Hi' she said,\nlooking up, 'my name's Elizabetamargueritasuzzannachristiana, but you can call\nElizabetamarguerita. 'How about\n'Elisa'?' I suggested delicately. 'Oh\nalright, but let's face it, it's nowhere\nnear as sophisticated and classic i ally Italian is it?' she said, disappointed.\nShe was fascinated to learn of Bija's name. I joked 'it means man who\nwalk tall behind elephant in face of\nbig droppings.' 'Oh' replied the girl\nseriously. 'That's amazing even\nthough it's not classically Italian.'\nOur initial y Physiology practical\ninvolved taking blood samples from\neach other. Demonstrators showed\nus how to locate veins, gen dy insert\nthe needle of a syringe at an angle,\nand never to push in the plunger if\nthe syringe contained air since the\npatients tended to die soon\nafterwards. I saw Morton\nsadistic aly lie 'Oops, accident,\nsorry,' while repeatedly ramming\nneedles deep into Gordon's arm\ninstead of blood sampling.\nIn our first lectures I was\nsurprised to find a very friendly\nstaff-Student Union relationship,\nsince I had got used to a more\ndistant form at Imperial where I couldn't actually recall ever seeing\nanybody from the SU. Afterwards,\nMorton came up to me in a friendly\nway, saying 'Hey, that'll make a great shoplifting bag, was great for\nstealing items off shelves. You\nwon't believe how much you can\nwalk away with,' he relished. I hurriedly left and went to the\ncanteen\u2014called 'Glady's' after the\nfiery little old battle axe who ran\nit\u2014and sat around talking with Bija\nand Tetuso, who was always keen\nto practice his English. 'I very\nimpressed with Morton' he\nconfessed. 'He use so much effort\nin swearing. In Japan is more\nefficient only say one bad word, but\nhe use lots and lots.' He shook his\nhead in awe.\nLater that day I dropped into the\nstudent hall 'Nutford House' to see\nBija. He was worried about his\nneighbour opposite. 'The old boy's plumb loco,' he whispered. We\nlooked past Bija's open door\ntowards his neighbour's who had\nhung a poster of a man being flayed\nalive by a tall demon outside his\nroom, only to realise that he had\nslipped open his door slightly and\nwas watching us through the crack.\nThe next morning I met Marian\non the bus. 'I'm heavily into all this\nMedicine stuff,' she asserted. 'The\nfact I did a Physics degree instead\nhas nothing to do with it,' she added\nhastily. 'Only a Republican would\neven think such nasty thoughts like\nthat.'\nOur Medical Statistics lecture\nwas in the mysterious Cockburn\nTheatre, and I tried asking a couple\nof nurses for directions. Except\nMorton came up, flung an arm\naround their necks and whispered\n'Hi babes. Let's go make babies.'\nThey gave him nasty looks and left,\nleaving him bewildered. Luckily,\nGordon was nearby. 'It's up in the\nhospital. I don't wish to brag but I did rather well at school' he said.\n'F*** me!' said Morton as we\nentered. 'AH these white walls!\nSomeone get me a spray can!' To my dismay, my pen dried up\nhalfway through the lecture. Ile ant over and asked Morton if he had a spare pen I could borrow. He\nflipped one over. At the end of the\nlecture Morton turned and\ndemanded \u00a31 for borrowing his\npen. 'You can have it back, I only\nneeded it for the lecture,' I said,\nscandal is ed. But he insisted, and I found myself forking out the cash,\nwhile he smirked. 'Golly, that\nperson sure use long words,' said\nTetsuo. 'What that last word mean?\nThe long one\u2014yep?' He suddenly\nfrowned, looked through his bag\nand realised he had forgotten to\nbring in his practical file. He\nmoaned 'Oh shit, I'm dead!' looked\nfurtively around to check nobody\nwas watching, then started banging\nhis head against the desk. I hurriedly tried to stop him as he was\ndamaging the surface of the bench.\nA little later I met Stephen, a friend from Imperial who had\ndropped over from his 4-year\n'Applied Biology' degree. We sat\nin the library balcony, talking. A boy named Syd Masam came up\ngrinning, said 'Call me Mazza' and\nwalked away, guffawing. We stared.\nafter him for a moment, then I went\non to ex palin to Stephen how the >\nwork was a lot more interesting than\nPhysical Biochemistry, but the\nactual workload was very heavy.\nLater that evening I dropped into\nthe medical students' hall 'Wilson\nHouse', curious what Morton might\nget up to at night. I walked along\nthe 'Corridor of Faith' where all the\nrising young Christian Union stars\nlike Marcus Peron, Alician and\nothers lived among lesser mortals,\nwalking around the odd jar of\nburning incense and the\n'ATHEISTS PLEASE TURN RIGHT' signs pointing towards the\ntoilets. I found Morton in the TV room watching 'Casualty' for\nlaughs, with a 'Heh heh heh' as\neach accident happened and the\noccasional 'Yes, yes, go on, stick\nyour hand all the way in, you fool'.\nHe started to tell me about how one\nPage 10\n\n"

The\nhelmets may be sold from Imperial\nCollege Union Reception before the\nend of the academic year.\ne dic training eased\nby Declan Curry\nMore intensive training could\nreduce the training period for junior\ndoctors from 12 to 7 years,\naccording to a new report. The\ninquiry team led by Dr Kenneth\nCaiman, the chief Medical Officer,\nalso called for a rapid increase in\nthe number of consultants, and\nbetter communications between\neducational bodies, postgraduate\ndeans, and NHS management.\nThe Caiman report has now been\npresented to Virginia Bottomley,\nthe Health Secretary. The report is\nalso being sent to professional,\neducational and health service\ngroups for consultation, with\ncomments requested by 1 July.\nThe Caiman team was set up in\nJuly 1992 to- examine current\narrangements for specialist medical\ntraining, and to see if changes were\nneeded to bring the UK into line\nwith European medical directives\non minimum training standards and\nmutual recognition of\nqualifications. The team examined\nthree main areas: the content of\nspecialist training programmes; the\nsystem for appointment to\nconsultant posts; and the relations\nbetween UK and European\nCommunity (EC) medical\nlegislation.\nThe report said that specialist\ntraining in the UK was\n'substantially longer' than in\nEurope, and could be reduced\nwithout threatening standards. The\nreport called for specialist training\nwith 'defined starting and finishing\npoints and structured curricula,'\nemphasising that the lack of a definite 'end-point' extends the\nlength of training. The document\nalso called for flexibility, choice,\ncompetition and assessment on\nmerit to be in-built in training\nprogrammes.\nOn training grades, the report\nrecommended 'that the career\nregistrar and senior registrar grades\nbe combined.' It also called for\nconsideration of a single training\ngrade 'incorporating the Senior\nHouse Office Grade'. The report\nalso recommended that a Certificate\nof Completion of Specialist\nTraining (CCST) should be\nawarded by the General Medical\nCouncil when 'a doctor has\ncompleted a training programme to\na standard compatible with\nindependent practice.'\nThe Caiman team say that the\nmain body of the report could be\nimplemented within 2 or 3 years 'of\nbeing accepted by ministers', said\nthe team, though 'the expansion of\nconsultant numbers may take 5\nyears'.\nABRC for axe in Waldegrave White Paper fury\nby Declan Curry\nThere is concern this morning for\nthe future of one of Britain's top\nscientific bodies. The Government\nhas studiously refused to deny\npersistent press reports that it is to\naxe the Advisory Board for the\nResearch Councils (ABRC).\nThe ABRC is an expert group of\nscientists which independently\nadvises the Government on\nscientific policy. The Board has a reputation for vigorous\nindependence, founded on a history\nof stormy confrontation with a long\nline of Education and Science\nministers. Recently, Education\nSecretaries, including John\nMcGregor and Kenneth Clarke\nhave refused to publish\nrecommendations from the\ncommittee.\nThe anxiety for the future of the\nABRC comes as the Government is\nputting the finishing touches to its\nScience White Paper, due in early\nJune. The contents of the White\nPaper will be influenced by the\nresults of the year-long consultation\ninitiated by Mr Waldegrave after he\nwas appointed Science Minister in\n1992. Over 700 submissions were\nreceived by the Government during\nthe consultation period. The ABRC\nwas one of many bodies to submit\nproposals to the Science\nconsultation.\nThis consultation paper from the\nABRC is now the nub of the\ndisagreement between the\nGovernment and its scientific\ncritics. Tom Wilkie, the\nIndependent's Science Editor,\nclaimed this week that Mr Waldegrave would use the\npublication of the White Paper to\nabolish the ABRC in its current\nform, and to replace them with a Civil Service committee firmly\nbased within the Science Ministry.\nMr Wilkie further predicted that the\nABRC would be wound up in\nSeptember after Sir David Phillips,\nthe current ABR C chairman,\nretires. Since the publication of the\nIndependent article, Felix has been\ninformed that Sir David's contract\nwas renewed for a final six-month\nterm 'within the last few weeks'.\nGovernment information officers\ncontacted by Felix all refused to\ndeny that a plan exists to abolish the\ncurrent ABRC. Tim Hunt, a senior\npress officer at the Office of Public\nService and Science, said that Mr Waldegrave 'has made it quite clear\nthat he intends to maintain an\nindependent advisory system, with\nexperts from academia and\nindustry'. Another spokesman, who\ndid not disclose her name, said that\nMr Waldegrave wanted the 'best\npossible independent advice.'\nMr Hunt told Felix that the\nIndependent article was 'not st ric dy true', and that Mr Wilkie was 'not\nstrictly accurate'. Mr Hunt added\nthat the idea for the reform of the\nABRC sprang directly from the\nBoard's own submission to the\nscience policy consultation. Mr Hunt later clarified his comments,\nand said it was 'not strictly true' to\nsuggest that the ABRC had asked\nto be dissolved. This suggestion had\nbeen made to Felix by Andrew\nPuddephatt, General Secretary of\nLiberty, formerly the National\nCouncil of Civil Liberties, who\nadded that he had been 'misled by\nthe Independent.' Earlier, in the\nIndependent article, Mr Puddephatt\nwas quoted describing the\n'abolition' of the ABR C as\n'hypocrisy'.\nMr Hunt claimed the ABRC\nsubmission 'indicated broadly a case for another body with more\npowers and with a more wide\nranging brief than their own.' Mr Hunt added that the ABRC called\nfor Mr Waldegrave to consider\nforming 'another independent\nbody'.\nMr Hunt's comments have been\nslammed by Dr Jeremy Bray, MP for Motherwell South and former\nLabour Science and Technology\nspokesman. Dr Bray told Felix that\nMr Hunt was 'misinterpreting what\nthe ABRC said.' A spokesman for\nDr Lewis Mooney, Labour's current Science spokesman, said\nthat the ABRC submission called\nfor 'a board for the research\ncouncils', and did not call for the\nabolition of the current research\ncouncils board, the ABRC. Dr John\nMulvey, of the Bath-based pressure\ngroup Save British Science, said\nthey would soon issue an\n'alternative' White Paper, which\nwould propose changes to the\nABRC. 'We would separate the\nimplementation and shaping of\npolicy,' he said.\nPage 2\n\n"

As we sat in\n'Glady's' afterwards, Bija was still\nembarrassed about the event.\nMarian slapped him consoling ly on\nthe shoulder and drawled 'I did just\nthe same when I was on 'crack' to\nget over my PMT. Cheer up, it\ncould've been worse; why, you\nmight have been born a Republican.'\nOne evening I saw an accident\u2014a young man was knocked down by\na car. I stopped to offer help, but\npassers-by had already called an\nambulance. I told the guys about it\nthe next day. 'Maimed?' Morton\nasked hopefully.\nOur lecture schedule was timed\nso we had our 'Sexual\nReproduction' lectures on\nValentines day. That weekend we\nhad our First Aid course with\nMorton gleefully finding all the\nways people can die 'or be crippled\nfor life, like, wow!'\nAfter lectures on Monday, I relaxed in the hospital coffee shop\nwith Tetsuo and Bija. Tetsuo had\nbeen describing the new generation\nof Japanese cars. 'You know, if I could have any car at all,' I said\ndreamily, 'it would be a huge\nRange-Rover with massive wheels.'\n'Really?' said Bija. 'That's jolly\ninteresting. Did you know the\nbigger a car somebody has, the\nsupposedly smaller their brain\ncapacity is?' 'But then again, Mini's also have a certain something, don't you think?' I asked. Tetsuo started\ntalking about how helpful London\npeople were. 'I got lost looking for\nJapanese friends flat,' he confessed\nFelix 965\n'imagine it's a row of goblins, guys,\nand you're lobbing a fireball' while\nwe played. He'dmu rmer ed mystic\nchants each time before he'd bowled, which he had learned from\nthe 'Necromicron' and the '20th Century Guide for Modern\nWitches'. He still lost.\nWe struggled through a confusing\nAnatomy lecture the following\nmorning. After it finished I found\nmyself talking to Julian, a boy who\nhad been gifted with two modes of\nspeech\u2014gently sarcastic, and\ncomplaining. 'Ah, you shop at\n'Topman's',' said Julian, wisely.\nGordon said 'I'm going to write\nsome poetry about meaningful\nrelationships now.' Adrian loped\nup, eating a malted loaf, and was\n7 May 1993\nconsisted of breaking into her flat\nin the 'Corridor of Faith',\nransacking her wardrobe, and\nselling her clothes to shoppers at\nCovent Gardens. Exasperated, I got\nrid of Morton by saying 'Look,\nsomething with a skirt and two legs\njust walked around the corner,'\u2014\nhe was off in a flash.\nLater that day, Marian asked if\nshe could borrow my set of 'Cell\nBiology' notes. I asked\napologetically if she might return\nthem before the weekend as I was\nplanning to go over them then.\n'Yeah, of course', she drawled.\n'Here, read-my-lips I promise I will.'\nMore medical mayhem next\nweek.\nfl ll ll tt i and 'kind man only balcony shout\ndown instructions.' He grinned self-consciously and said 'Problem is I not understand them! My English\nnot so good.' He frowned and asked\n'What Bugger off and Go home\nChink mean?'\nLeaving the hospital, I witnessed\nMorton going up to a group of tired\nnurses who had just finished their\nshifts, and trying 'Hi babes. Come\nhere often?'\nIn our Anantomy Dissections we\nhad now reached our corpse's hand.\n'Call-me-Mazza'-Syd gleefully\nsnipped about at its fingers, and we\nfound that by pulling tendons in the\nwrist we could make the dead man's fingers move and close and open.\nIt was eerie, I thought, while Syd\ncracked a few jokes and guffawed,\nmat night I went bowling with\nStephen and David, another old\nfriend from Imperial. For several\nyears now, Dave had been very\nkeen on ' Role-Playing-Games'.\nDressed in his 'Flower-Power' Tshirt, he kept exhorting us to\ngenially curious. 'About what?' he\nasked, amiably. 'Never mind, just\na comment beyond your education\nand/or intelligence', dismissed\nGordon as he left. 'Okay' agreed\nAdrian good-natured ly. 'How about\nbuying a copy of 'Socialist Worker'\ninstead?'\n'Oh, by the way, Adrian,'\nremarked Morton. 'You owe me \u00a32\nfor giving in your practical writeup together with mine.' Adrian\nprotested mildly and I left them\narguing. In the coffee-shop I met\nBija and Tetsuo. Tetsuo was\nwondering about London life again.\n'I see many men hang about outside\ngent's toilet last night' he explained.\n'Why they not go in? I ask one man\nthat. He give me strange look.\nThink he be falling down\u2014he put\nhand on my arm.' A chuckling\nMorton came up at this point and\nhissed to me that he had a plan to\nmake money out of Alicia.

This\nmeans that on the day, a balcony\nseat costs about the same as a West\nEnd cinema screening, not bad for\nlive entertainment on a scale larger\nthan anywhere else in London.\nAs might be expected from a company with a substantial boxoffice deficit from the last season,\nthere is nothing of a potentially\ntheatre-emptying adventurous ness, bar the world premiere of Blond\nEckbert, an ENO commission from\nJudith Weir. However, there is\nplenty of interest; a new Lohengrin\nmarks the return of Wagner to the\nENO repertoire after an absence of\neight years, and Jonathan Miller has\nbeen lured back to the Coliseum to\nproduce Rosenkavalier. This new\nproduction features John\nTomlinson, superb as Hagen in the\nrecent Covent Garden Ring, in the\npart of Baron Ochs, and is designed\nby Stefanos Lazaridis, who was\nresponsible for among other things\nthe memorable filing cabinet\ncityscape of Dr Faust.\nThe wonderful Jenufa is to have\nwhat is surprisingly its first ever\nproduction at the Coliseum in the\nFelix 965\nconsideration is that he should look\nlike 'someone' in a crisp suit rather\nthan the 'nobody' that he in fact is.\nHe also instills in his partner Joey\nthe necessity for good clothes.\nBoth actors were excellent in\ntheir portrayal of the two-bit hoods.\nThey made you believe that their\ncharacters were real, and added a lot to a mediocre script.\nThis was the play's world\npremiere.

Lenny said 'Man, you should\nread this book there is in the USA:\nit tells you how to make LSD with\nbanana skins\u2014and it's banned!'.\nWith banana skins? No way, I thought. Lenny hasn't got his hippy\nfacts quite right. Anyway, there\nmust be something in that book for\nit to be banned. Censorship\nparanoia is idiotic, not blind.\nThen Mike further aroused my\ninterest by adding, in his usual\ndetached manner: My roommate\nhas got it. It also tells you how to\nmake bombs.'\nHell. This is beginning to sound\ninteresting. I extracted some\napproximate title from them,\ngathering the book seemed available\nonly on mail-order.\n'Can you get me photocopies?' I asked.\n'Yeah sure' replied Mike,\ninstantly forgetting.\nI tried reminding the dudes\nseveral times over my' last\npostcards, then gave up.\nRecently, while zapping channels\non some unlicensed TV some\nresident on holidays had left in my\nroom, I fell upon one of these\ndaytime TV police stories (the 'true\nstory!' type), about this psycho\nrapist it had taken ages to corner.\nHe kept coming up with alibis and\nhis calm was intimidating a few'\nofficers.\n10 Revolutionary Quotes\n'The revolutionary reaches beyond dissent to nihilism and\nanarchy'\u2014Mayor John V.

We must show the world\nthese people connect to an\nunderworld of mentally deranged\nsocial outcasts who share literature\nthat's bad for your kids\u2014here's a sample on TV.I now had a clue that mail-order\nin the USA may not be the only way\nof getting my hands on this book.\nHow about trying Waterstones in\nHigh Street Ken?\nA really pleasant young lady\ninformed me they were out of stock,\nbut I could try Oxford Street. The\nnext day I went. There are so many\nbookstores up there, I decided to\nlook for more 'corrupting' Leary\nbooks as well.\nWell, the name 'Timothy Leary'\nreally earned me some strange\nreactions. Silent shaking heads with\neyes staring at the floor were the\nleast polite, 'No' without further\ncomment the average and 'Sorry.\nNone at the moment. But you've\ncome to the right place'.

No Leary\nbooks there. I was disappointed\nwhen the chaotic dusty secondhand\nbookstores didn't help either.\nFinally, a self-righteous puritan-looking 'miss' at Waterstones (what\na sadistic pleasure to ask ner!) sent\nme up to the second or third floor\nof one of their buildings, passing\n'Gay and Lesbian Christian prayer\nbooks' on the way up.\nThere the black Anarchist trophy\nawaited me, this time a cool dude\nbehind it, joking about how it could\nbe sold in USA now it had a disclaimer of intention on the back.\nI was to find Flashbacks, Tim\nLeary's autobiography, back at the\nHigh Street Ken branch.\nWell, the Cookbook was well\nworth its \u00a317.99.\nChapters on Drugs, Weapons,\nElectronic Devices and explosives!\nHow to synthesiseD MT( 'businessmen's LSD', so\nnicknamed because of its powerful\neffects that last the time of the\nlunch break) in the kitchen, tripping\non legal substances such as nutmeg\n(60p at Salisbury's) or Morning\nGlory seeds (about \u00a31 a pack of 60\nin garden centres) or using cactus\nbuttons, mushrooms, strange vines,\nsmoking peanut skins or toad skins\netc...For equipped chemistry labs,\ndetails on how to make LSD, p silo cyn or psy loc yb in are included.\nThe Weapons part is especially\nvalid for USA, since firearms are\nso readily available there\u2014building\nsilencers or converting machine\nguns to grenade launchers are some\nexamples given.

    "content": "Stones from heaven\nClubs & Societies\nFelix 965 7 May 1993\nM$ SM\nThey fall like stones from the sky.\nWell maybe not stones. Stones have\nsuch an unexciting sound to them.\nThey possess more shape than\nstones, you can see them as they\nfall. Twisting 360 degrees right,\ngracefully done. There is, though,\nsomething very basic about it that\nmakes me think of stones. How low\nthey come. Almost as if they don't intend to open their chutes at all.\nCan you reach out and touch them?\nTheir parachutes open. They are\ndecelerated and are drawn upright.\nNow instead of falling they glide,\nstill gracefully.\nThrough a pair of binoculars I can\nsee closer their form. Actual\nhumans. Arms and legs. That one\nwas unstable as he opened, twisting\nand turning. It always instils me\nwith such an urge. The need for\nexcitement. The desire to do\nsomething to de story the London\npollution that creeps within us all.\nOn the Sunday as we were\nreturning from Scotland in the\nminibus, someone asked me why I had continued to parachute after my\nfirst jump. He was sitting opposite\nme. He annoyed me somewhat.\nOne of those people who can't stop\ntalking, and he was very arrogant\nwith it too. He also asked me, after\nabout an hour of our nine hour\njourney, if I ever smiled. No, I replied, grinning.\nIt had been a very full weekend.\nArriving late Friday evening.\nSetting up tents in the rain and the\ndark with only one torch between\nthe ten of us. One of those pen\ntorches. You know the type. Free\nform Nat West it was. It reminded\nme of my first, and only, digital\nwatch. It had a light that was so\nweak that it would only show the\nminutes. Not the hours.\nWell, I received no sleep that\nnight, nor the preceding Saturday\nnight. I was so cold. The Scottish\nweather system. It's not a mystery\nSingles\nNext Thursday FilmSoc proudly\npresents 'Singles', our first film in\nour new home which is the Union\nConcert Hall. Bridget Fonda, Matt\nDillon, and Campbell Scott all\nappear in this good-natured and\nhumourous study of six friends in\nthe chick centre of Seattle. All the\nmain stars give winning\nperformances as hopeful\ntwenty something s exploring the\nto me. How can anything that is so\npredictable be a mystery to\nanybody? Scotland is great like that.\nSome places you go to the weather\ncan either make or break your stay.\nSomewhere like Spain. Not\nScotland though. In Scotland it\nmakes your stay. I haven't stopped\ntalking about it.\nI think the only reason that I didn't freeze at night was the fact\nthat my circulation was kept going\nby my jaw, telling anything that\nwould listen that I hated myself for\nmaking myself do something I didn't really want to do. Like sleep\nin a tent with all my clothes on,\nunable to curl up into a ball because\nthe damn tent is so small, and will\nthe bloody thing stay up anyway?\nIt fluttered around an awful lot. I'm sure it shouldn't do that.\nThat was the answer I gave to that\nguy on the bus. About the first jump\nand all. I was already annoyed at\nhim for noticing that I hadn't smiled\nin an hour. Do you not go an hour\nwithout smiling? I wondered. No,\nyou don't, do you? I saw his\narrogant grinning face.\nI get pensive on long journeys. I like to watch the country roll past.\nIn the dark? Admittedly, yet it was\ndark! But in the dark it is so much\nmore exciting. You stare, and you\nstare. Nothing at first. But you also\nlisten to the sound of travel. And\nthen all of a sudden you see what\nyou want to see from the bus.\nStraight from your mind.\nThoughts that are you. Memories.\nThat's nice I think. Like the lyrics\nto a song which you can't understand. You begin to hear them\nsay what you want them to say.\nSomething you can relate to.\nSomething that has happened to\nyou. Then, hey they're singing\nabout me! I really know this song.\nIf you find out what they're really\nsaying, it's disappointing. It's another love song. It happened to\nsingles scene, searching for love\nand all that comes with it. Comic\nmoments abound in this interesting\nmovie, divided into witty chapters,\neach with a title such as 'Have fun,\nstay single', by director Cameron\nCrowe, himself described as a combination of Woody Allen and\nJohn Hughes. Everyone that has\nseen this film mentions the excellent\nSeattle Grunge soundtrack, which\nsomeone else.\nHe sat in there grinning, anyway.\nOblivous to the sound of travel.\nWhy did you do more than one\njump? He repeated. He'd asked\neveryone else already. I get a kick\nfrom making myself do something\nthat I don't really want to do. I replied. It was the first thing that\nhad entered my head, although I had\nall too often asked myself the same\nquestion.\nWaiting to get into the plane\nearlier that day at Strathallan\nairfield is a good example. I was\nbloody scared, I suppose, is a good\nway of summing up how I felt.\nPerhaps it was to do with fact that\nI was about to jump out of a plane\nwith a parachute that I had packed\nfor myself not half an hour ago.\nHow safe I shall feel, I thought.\nWhen I sit on the edge of the plane,\nlegs blown sideways by the cool air.\nThen when I did sit hanging out of\nthe plane, it really struck me.\nYou're going to jump out of a plane\nwith a parachute you packed\non its own makes the film worth\nseeing! 'Singles' was not marketed\nat the movies in a massive way that\nmost films are, but it proved very\npopular, so if you missed it in\nJanuary, now is your chance to put\nthe record straight. Watch out for\na cameo appearance by Tim Burton,\nand we'll see you there!\nDon't forget, we have moved\nhome from Mech Eng 220 to the\nbetter Union Concert Hall, courtesy\nof a strangely helpful sabbatical and\nour acquisition of an excellent new\nyourself? Jesus! I could see the\nepitaph right then. Chisselled into\ncrumbling green rock years in the\nfuture. A child reads it, as you do.\nHere lies Rob Jones. You know, he\ncouldn't even pack his lunch box\nwithout crushing the Blue Riband?\nBut it was a familiar feeling. And\ndealing with it really gives me a buzz. The adrenal in courses\nthrough your veins. You become\nvery single-minded.\nYou see that big yellow cross out\nthere? I pointed at the target 2000ft below us and half a mile away.\nContained per fec dy by the beautiful\nScottish highlands. Yeah. The jump\nmaster yelled above the noise of the\nsingle engine. That's where you'll\nsee me land. That's where I 'll be\nwhen I hit the ground!\nI missed of course. But that is\nhow you become after your first\njump. It's not like any other sport\nI know. You are left in awe by the\nfear you have felt and what you\nhave achieved.\nscreen. So not only can you expect\nour presentation quality to have\ndramatically improved, but now\nyou can enjoy a drink or snack from\nDa Vinci's at the same time. Doors\nopen at 7.15pm and the film will\nstart at 7.30pm as usual. Everyone\nis welcome, admission is only\n\u00a31.90, and members get in for 90p as usual.

Issue 965 7 May 1993\nChanges at\nImperial\nCollege Union\nOn Monday radical changes to the\nstructure of Imperial College Union\n(ICU) will be proposed at a meeting\nof the student Union's most\npowerful body.\nRestructing ICU has been a goal\nof ICU President Chris Davidson\nsice the beginning of his term of\noffice. From the start of 1993 the\nopinions of students at Imperial\nhave been canvassed in a series of\nfocus groups. Mr Davidson recently\ngranted leave by ICU Council to\ninvestigate solutions to the problems\nraised by these focus groups.\nOver Easter a working party of\nfive people was set up by Mr Davidson to discuss and propose\nchanges to ICU structure. On\nMonday their recommendations for\nchange will be put before ICU\nCouncil. The general outline of\nthese proposals have been generally\nleaked and members of council have\nbeen lobbied over the past week for\ntheir opinions on the changes.\nAt present ICU is responsible to\na Union General Meeting of all\nstudents held once a term.\nManagement of the Union is run by\nICU Council which meets once a month, with day to day running\ndecided by Sabbaticals and\nConstituent College Union (CCU)\nPresidents. Council contains fifty\nfive representative from most\nsections of the Union's activities:\nDepartmental Representatives,\nC CU Presidents, Major and Minor\nSub Committee Chairmen for Clubs\nand Societies to have a voice,\nWelfare and Academic\nRepresentatives will also sit on the\nnew body.\nIn principle, the proposals\nrecommend the abolition of ICU Council to be replaced by a thirteen\nor fourteen man Executive\ncommittee. This committee would\nhave power for the running of the\nUnion with each member\nrepresenting the views of an area of\nthe students union to the executive.\nAll positions on the executive wold\nbe made up from currently existing\nposts.\nThe members of the proposed\nexecutive would be: President,\nresponsible for Union staff and\nrepresentation, Hon Sec, looking\nafter all clubs and societies,\nOverseas Student member, Post\nGraduate Affairs Officer, Academic\nAffairs Officer, Welfare Officer,\nCommunications Officer, Deputy\nPresident and the four Presidents of\nthe Constituent College Unions: St\nMary's, City and Guilds, Royal\nSchool of Mines and the Royal\nCollege of Science.\nMr Davidson does not expect the\nplans to be approved in full by\nCouncil. Alterations will be made\nover the next few weeks so that a proposal can be made on the Annual\nGeneral Meeting on 23rd June. If\nthis successful then the changes will\nhave to be approved by the\nGoverning Body of Imperial\nCollege before they are\nimplemented.\nChris Davidson: sitting pretty\nBalls to the Wall\nPoor ticket sales threaten to wreck\nthis year's May Balls at Imperial.\nAs Felix goes to press on Thursday\nafternoon, members of the City and\nGuilds Union (C& GU) executive\nare meeting to decide the fate of the\nC& GU Ball. It is widely expected\nthat the ball will be cancelled.\nAny C& GU May Ball\ncancellation would follow last\nFriday's decision by the Royal\nCollege of Science Union (RCSU)\nto cancel the RCSU May Ball. This\nis the third cancellation of a major\nfunction by the RCSU in twelve\nmonths. Last year's RCSU May\nBall was cancelled after the\n'withdrawal' of the Capital 95.8FM roadshow, and in January of this\nyear, the RCSU Annual Dinner was\nscrapped after poor ticket sales.\nKate Dalton, C& GU President,\ndescribed the situation as\n'unfortunate', but declined to give\na reason for the lack of sales. This\nyear's tickets retail at a lower price\nthan last year. The RCSU were\ncharging \u00a350 per double ticket and\n\u00a330 per single, while the C& GU are\ncharging \u00a345 per double and \u00a325\nper single ticket.\n3/4/5 10/11 12/13 18/19\nWot No Mary's Anarchy Carnival\nOpinion Madness in the UK Knowledge\n\n"

    "content": "M Albums\nMega City 4 \u2014 Magic Bullets\nThe balance between lyrics and\nmelodies is a delicate one at the best\nof times, but when even the arch-word smith Bob Dylan produces ' A Froggy Went A Courting', you\nknow something is amiss in the\nworld we call popular music. Still\non 'Magic Bullets' MC4 do their\nbest to redress the Emperor in\npresentable garb. No messing about\nwith tree feeding or spilling coffee\nover Zurich here; this is standard\nMC4 fare the personal stuff which\nis the poetry of our generation. It's unfortunate then that you have to\nbuy the album to get the word sheet. In strides the Emperor, proud of\nhis new found attire. Bold he\napproaches his willing subjects.\nAlas without belt or braces his final\nembarrassment is even more ac cute when his trousers end up round his\nankles. As a great man didn't say,\n'function follows form'. Such is the\ncase in 'Magic Bullets' as the songs\nare just not up to the words, with\n'Greener' and 'Perfect Circle' being\nbad examples. Great words, shame\nabout the face. When it does all\ncome together as in 'Wallflower',\n'Toys' and 'Speck' you get an idea\nof how it could be. 'Speck's' wistful\nand almost folk ish background\nmelts into the harmony vocals and\njust lets Wizz tell us about getting\nFelix 965\nold. Then the album ends and I feel\ncheated. The best song on last. In\nhis own words 'If only life was\nfair.'.\nTintin.\n\u2022 Released May 10th on Big\nLife.\nThe Fall: Couldn't you find an older photo? two of these guys are dead\nnow.\nThe Fall: The Infotainment\nS can Down in the sweaty bowels of\njour no land, us hacks prepare for\nsuch moments as this by curling our\nlips, adding the suffix 'ah' to the\nend of every word, and smoking\nlots. Uh-huh, uh-huh, here-ah we\ngo-ah; We're lost-ah in music-ah.\nAnother Fall album, after the\nmassive 'Code: Selfish', here again,\nspitting out Mark E Smith's mouth y humour to proliferate across the\nearth (ged d it ah?) in ever-more\naccessible ways. For instance,\nSister Sledge's 'Lost In Music' is\ngiven the unique 'Fall-do-a cover'\ntreatment, and the little pretty press\nUS1C\n7 May 1993\ndarlings themselves come under\nSmithy's lush and pithy scrutiny in\n'Glam Racket': ' You are\nentrenched-ah in Suede-ah'. Can't you just see Brett and Bernard\nsoaking up their perfect tears with\ntheir silk hankies?\nAnd that's not all, pop pets, for this\nimmeasurably tre a sur able album\nhas more super lip-smackers than a whole factory's worth of chocolate\nwillies; 'Why are People\nGrudgeful?', 'The League of BaldHeaded Men', 'I'm Going to Spain'\nand the delightful 'It's a Curse', a boot-print on the arse of nostalgic\n(or an ally retentive) seventies tw at s, with lines like 'Vimto and Spangles\nwere crap', and god, yes! they're\nright! You'd get red rim stains at\nthe corners of your mouth from\nvim to, and spangles were\ninstrumental in the redundancy of\nthe late great boiled sweet. Yep, the\nsour old bastard has still got his\nfinger on the pulse; and more than\never, the Fall are looking like the\nsaviours of pop as an art form by\ntheir very artlessness. Bloody\nmagnificent.\nDonny O 'Nonchalant\n\u2022 Out now on Permanent. Kind of\nironic, that. 'Permanent'. The Fall\nalso play the Grand at Clapham\nJunction on 15 & 16 May.\nPolly Harvey: Knives out for the lads\nPJ Harvey: Rid of Me Balls to the wall, sisters, lest they\nbe clipped off like corp sing shrubs\nby the dirty sec at eur s of a girl\nimagining she possesses a dick to\nuse them on. 'Rid of Me' is firstly\na masterpiece of marketing for left-handed people (of all kinds), and\nbeing of sinister leanings myself,\nI'm happy about this. Secondly,\n'Rid of Me' is a hugely powerful\nrecord, the like of which hasn't been seen since last year's debut\n'Dry', and thirdly, I'm kind of\namused by the effect she has on\nmen.\nThe title-track sets the mood,\nveering from affected calm to\nexplosive, and catching the listener\nin mid-breath as the words 'lick my\nlegs, I'm on fire' are screeched in\nthe background; the stringed-up\n'Man-size sextet' is one of the\nscariest songs I 've ever heard, I even looked in the fridge to see if\nmy spine was in there (Actually,\nthat's a lie, but 'Man-size sextet' is\na real chilly song). Bobby D's 'Highway 61 revisited' and the\nsingle '50 ft Queenie' are positive\nlight relief after that. 'Rid of Me'\nhas thus far exposed more of those\ndelicate little prejudices the music\nmedia has painted on the front of its\nnylon knickers. Sex sells records,\nright? Right. How many people\nconfuse desirability with\nrespectability? Not many. Are all\npop stars then, tarts of a cheap and\ndirty kind? Well, some are slightly\nshop-soiled... Notable exceptions?\nHmm, difficult one, that; Sinead, I suppose... So Sinead hasn't been\nexploited for so many tabloid\ncolumn inches? Aha....\nOk, so Sinead shaves her head, and\nscreams, and rants and rails; hey\npresto! one hundred thousand men\nstand up, open their arms and think\n'She's saying 'please understand\nme\". Polly Harvey looks like a grubby-faced orphan-child straight\nfrom the pages of Dickens, sings\nnasty noisy songs about being hurt,\nbeing fucked, and wordless ly suggests how probable it is that both\nwill occur at the same time. Yeah,\nshe's a great female icon, a black eyed anti-Madonna, and this\nis cool if you like your anti-social\nfigureheads as obviously dirty as\nthey can be, but what worries me\nis that I don't know if she reaches\nwomen with what she does; I would\nlike to believe it were so, but the\nonly people I know really listening\nto PJ Harvey are lads, doing the\nvoyeur thing that lads do, and\ndreaming of being humiliated by\nher. Ah, fuck it. Who am I to\nquestion the way things are.\n'Tarzan, I'm pleading, stop your\nfucking screaming'- 'Me-Jane'\nIf you hadn't guessed already,\nthere's few things I find as\nsickening as the modern variation\nof the protective male, showered in\ncheap aftershave and facsimile\nsensitivity, nose anticipating the\nsmells of woman, eyes examining\nthe swells beneath the jumper. Polly\nJean is looking for that kind of\nsympathy, too; she's sharpening the\nspare on her castrate-oma tic just in\ncase she finds it.\n'Katrice.\n\u2022 Out now on Island Records. This\nis the last warning we will give you,\nbut PJ Harvey play the London\nForum on the 23rd&24 th May.\nDon't blame us if you can't get in.\nPage 17\n\n"

    "content": "M Felix 965\nUS1C\n7 May 1993\nas no surprise to discover that the\nHeartthrobs do 'brilliant' for a living, i.e. they're f** kin ace.\nStreams of guitar sounds weaved\ntogether into steamed tunes, crisply\nwreathed around watertight\nrhythms and poignant singing. God,\nit's gorgeous; frequently out-musing the Muses, and yet at the\nsame time, considerably earthier. It\nis this fallible corporeal it y which\nmade '91 's 'Total Abandon' E.P. one of that year's more enduring\nreleases. A polka dot dress shot with\nperspiration, recently elegant hair\nnow disturbed and straggly; it could\nbe Josephine rejected if it wasn't for\nthe guitar occasionally worn like a heart on her sleeve. It's a lovely\nsoulful performance, and I am\ndelighted to see the audience agree.\nA call for a second encore is politely\ndeclined, and we leave it for that\nmost sombre of pleasures. A beer.\nAfter witnessing our two\nillustrious Ents Chairmen persuade\nan indecent o ik to leave before,\nwell, before he's ejaculated, I suppose... Ahem... We go,\nOnwards and Upwards, clutching\nbeers and belts, and dragging\nourselves over the sticky,\nshimmering stairs to the concert hall\nto wait for the legendary Pauline\nBlack. The concert hall really is\nsuperb for atmosphere and\nacoustics, and I was left feeling\nsomehow that the Heartthrobs had\ngot a raw deal, that if they had\nplayed in the Concert Hall, they'd have been unstoppable, but never\nmind. I'm a professional, suffering\na professional's indignities, while\nnot being paid a professional's salary. Selecter. Hold Tight.\nThe Vorpal Beaver, as our\nresident photographic artiste wishes\nto be known, contorts himself into\nsome quite incredible positions to\ncapture Pauline's steel-eyed Sturm\nUnd Drang as she commands first\nthe band, then the stage, then the\naudience. She looks mean, vicious,\na booted brute-boy shrieking over\nthe sizzling funk pulses of a dozen\nska classics, including 'Too Much\nPressure', 'On My Radio' and a cover of'Madness'. Glory. Glory.\nLay it all on me. The audience, such\nas it is, have space enough to kick\nout, goose-step, frog-march,\nwhatever the fuck they want, so\nlong as they can call it dancing. I employ the long-suffering\nphotographer to ever more unusual\nangles for a few more shots before\ngiving up, giving in, and kick in' out\nwith the best of them. The\nentertainment winds down, the\ncamera winds on, the crowd, newly\nd is orientated, wanders off to their\nprotection from the real world, oft-even the vor pal beaver's complaints\nhad cheerful overtones. My thanks\nto them. To Kerr-McCabe PLC; God's Zoo do their sk ank in' thing\ntimes conveniently referred to as\n'bed'. I'm sorry so few of you could\nfind the time to attend, but I enjoyed\nmyself, the razor ed and romantic\ntroubadour enjoyed himself, and\nthanks, boys. It was a bit smart.\nDonny O 'Nonchalant\nwith Vorpal Beaver and the\nClose-Cropped Troubadour.\nThe Great Pauline Black, looking well hard\nNext Week: What we promised you last week\nDid they really call it 'Swing Ding'? Crap name. Also, what is meant by 'Skankin'?\nPage 19\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 965\nO pinion\n7 May 1993\nthe sixties? He felt that the leading\nfigures of that era were more clear\ncut, there was a feeling of society\nthat does not exist today. More\nimportantly, that this feeling was\nmore worthy than the splinters that\nexist now.\nThere is no problem in existing\ninformation destroying that image:\nNixon, Kennedy, Cuba, Vietnam,\nCzechoslovakia, Cyprus, Student\nRiots in Paris, Shooting of Martin\nLuther King, J Edgar Hoover, the\nfact that Mick Jagger is older than |\nJohn Major and Cilia Black was -around then too. OK, so my f argumentative companion likes to I look back at his youth with rose-tinted spectacles, but he still has a point. How did these people achieve\nthe place in history they occupy,\nand what does it say about us?\nIn my opinion the hippy\nmovement of the sixties could never\nrecur, we have become much too\ncynical. The crazes that sweep the\nnation are designed for the very\nyoung and are quickly forgotten.\nRebellion has become\ninstitutional is ed in music and\npolitics. More people go to\nconcerts, no one dances in the\nstreet, mass demonstrations are no\nlonger vogue, quiet lobbying is the\norder of the day. So have all the\nrebels gone? Has the urge to rebel\nvanished?\nIf I was alive in the sixties and I knew Bob Dylan would reach the\nsignificance he has, I would want\nto destroy his credibility. Anyone\nwho inspires the sort of blind\ndevotion he did, must be put into\nperspective. Although individuals\nwill emerge for whom the nineties\nwill be remembered, we are better\noff without them. Societies can not\nbe pushed around by the\nindividuals, they evolve. If anyone\nclaims to speak for the masses they\nare lying. We do not need icons; we\nneed cynicism.\nCredits\nNews: Andrew Tseng, Declan.\nFeature: Hans, Mary's person\nReviews: Donny, Phil, Tintin,\nLucas, Flossie, Patrick, Al, Glyph\nMac, & the lovely Tilly & Lucy\nThanks to: Rose, Andy, A carefree mormon, Tamsin, Steve,\nBee, the Vorpal Beaver, Mike,\nAlex, Stefff, Tina, Stuart, Simon,\nSuzanne, Sonia, Andy and BJ for\na sense of humour..please...,\nClose Cropped Troubadour,\nEASAN HAPPY BIRTHDAY,\nJilly Cooper, Chris Rick and\nDom, Tom Baker, Oscar Wilde,\nMartyn Lewis.\nEditorial\nWhat has inspired me? What has\ninspired the generation that I am a member of? An acquaintance posed\nthese questions to me, and I am lost\nfor an answer.\nThe only icons I can point to are\npersonal ones. Mick Jagger and\nKeith Richards mainly, and that just\nreveals me as a relic of times past.\nThe Doors have held a fascination,\nif only for needing explanation of\nhow Jim Morrison lasted so long.\nWhat the questioner really\nwanted to know was what did I, as\na representative of today's youth (or\nyo of), think were the icons of our\nage. He was worried that Nintendo,\nSega and computer use were\n'fracturing society'; that machines\nwere destroying the motivation of\nour culture, the individual was\nbeing pampered to, the collective\nignored.\nI never was any good at\nrepresenting today's youth,\nhowever it is spelt, the only person\nI have ever been any good at\nshowing off is myself. But still,\nwhat do I believe will be the\nmemories of our current state?\nWhat do I think the history books\nwill look back on and remember\nabout 1993? OK, I 'll give it a go:\nGrunge, Take That, Blind Date,\nGladiators, The Big Breakfast,\nMaastricht and Bosnia. All those\nwere off the top of my head, but that\nis just me, how do I know what\ninspires a culture? How do I know\nif history will judge Cilia Black to\nbe worthy of note?\nStrangely enough, the questioner\ncould produce a list of icons for his\ngeneration and I agreed with it.\nWho could argue that Bob Dylan\nand Timothy Leary did not affect\nCat's Eyes\nJilly Cooper's, Riders\nAs my literary associate Donny said\n(see Music reviews); 'sweaty hog\nbollocks'.\nBitch, Bitch In a recently held meeting, Dave\nCohen (IC Radio boss/godfather\nand Nicholas Cage look-a like,\nalthough Nick isn't going thin on\ntop quite as fast as Dave is), said\n'...Felix is a place for literary\ntypes...' (when compared to IC\nRadio and STOIC). This fact is\nundeniably true. But is he implying\nthat IC Radio and STOIC are places\nfor illiterate types? Could the TC in both logos mean something else,\nperhaps Illiterate Club?\nSpace&Time Filler\nDr. Who, as played by Tom Baker.\nDeep& Meaningful Was the idea of a God created by\nMan? Thousands of years before\nscience, man had little answers to\nmany of life's riddles. To answer\nthe unknown, he could have created\na' God', a supernatural\nmanifestation, a supreme being.\nThe psychological appeal of this\n'God' was so great, it spread among\nall races, often changing in form as\nit did so.\nAll der i vates have continued similar\ntraits through time: worship,\nceremonies, symbolism, obeying\nlaws; and most are still practiced\ntoday. But is there really something up\nthere worth praying to? Or does a 'God' only exist in the minds of\nthose who wish him to exist?\nMarmalade Sandwich Message to the editor of St.Marys\nmagazine, Marmalade Sandwich,\nand to the writer of an article in\nwhich IC students were labelled as\ntrain spotters. Message reads:\n'bollocks'. Message ends.\nObitchuary @\nMay God have mercy on the soul\nof our beloved Islam Argument.\nIA's life was unexpectedly cut short\nlast Friday (30th April) in a malicious crime that rocked the\nletters page. It will be dearly missed\nby all its followers.\nThe offender was 17 lines of Bold\nText that materialise d from the\nMCS Compugraphic typesetter.\nThe Bold Text was arrested the\nfollowing Wednesday and stands\ntrial in a few days time, accused of\ndepriving a columnist of material to\nuse. The MCS Typesetter was\ncharged with aiding and abetting but\nwas later released following a tear-jerking emotional plea from all it's nearest and dearest.\nLegal Mum bo Jumbo The 'Obitchuary' slogan was used\nwith kind permission and remains the exclusive property of Lise\nYates, and is under the protection of the 1988 Copyright Act.\nBut since she died two months ago, this notice is consequently\ninvalid and should be ignored forthwith.\nFine Print:\nP.J.

    "content": "'eat ure7 May 1993 Felix 965\nAre the Nerds next door?\nCan you picture a typical Imperial student? Jonty Beavan asks the opinions\nof Imperial students about this peculiar character\nThe digital alarm goes off, slowly\na rake-like figure rises from the\nnarrow, duvet-covered bed.\nClimbing up he moves over to the\nsink and switches on the light above\nit. He winces, waiting for the glare\nto fade, he places his glasses on his\nmalformed nose. The acne had\nflared up again overnight, but\nheroically, he scrapes the Bic razor\nacross his chin, making manly scars\nout of pimples. When he has\nfinished he clambers into the faded\nblue jeans and pulls on a heavy\nmetal T shirt. Opening the curtains\nhe looks out across a waking\ncampus; the day of a typical IC\nstudent has begun.\nIs this really the case? Is every\none at Imperial a poor excuse for\na human being? The Students of St\nMary's Hospital Medical School\nseem to think so: In the recent issue\nof their magazine 'Marmalade\nSandwich' IC students were\ndescribed as: trains potters, unable\nto chat up girls and only interested\nin playing the recorder.\nBut what do we think of\nourselves? Is this the image\nImperial sees when it looks into its\nown navel? Armed with a badly\nfunctioning tape recorder and a list\nof questions, I roamed the JCR in\nsearch of the souls of our scientists.\nAdmittedly I never expected anyone\nto confess to intimate knowledge of\nthe 7.15 from London to Brighton,\nso I planned ahead. After asking\nhow IC was perceived by those in\nits walls, I tossed in a couple of\nquestion to give you all a chance to\nshow your worldly knowledge.\nSmugly superior? Me? Not a chance. A warning in advance: Due\nto the poor recording equipment and\nmy lack of technical knowledge,\nspellings of names from now on\nbecome creative. I do apologise for\nany offence caused, none is\nintended.\nAfter talking to several people, I discovered that I hadn't switched on\nmy tape recorder. Studying science\nat IC doesn't count for that much.\nA few technical hiccups later Demi\nbecame my first 'on the record'\nvictim. As a physics student she saw\nthe general mass around her as\nhard-working and unconcerned by\nfashion. Her reason for coming to\nImperial was the academic record\nand the credibility of the degree\nhere. The last book she had read\nwas Swing Hammer Swing, the\nlatest Booker prize winner. A ludicrous number of people I spoke\nto had seen the Jungle , Book\nrecently, but Demi was the first one\nto admit to it. If she could have\nanything of her heart's desire? A tent or a holiday was the best offer\nshe could muster.\nNext Sutatrsam had a vivid\npicture of our average student:\nJeans, Jacket, Specs and very\nstudious because he is studying for\nexams all the time. Sutatrsam's most recent read was a text book\nand he joined the crowd who had\nspent time watching the Jungle\nBook over Easter. If the world\ncould offer him any richness, what\nwould it be? Peace and quiet is his\nonly need.\nOne feeling that emerged was that\nwhile other colleges looked up to us\nacademically, we were social\npariahs. Quite a few s pods about,\nsaid Tom Halliwell; there are too\nmany science students here.\nRichard Steeps saw the IC student\nas wearing a Parka coat, greasy\nblack hair with ever present glasses.\n'Spoddy wan kers' was Bruce\nPatterson's description, he lives\nwith friends from University\nCollege London and Kings College.\n'Everybody hates us' he continued,\nbut did he regret corning here? 'Yes\nI do actually', he muttered\nmorosely.\nIt became clear that the decision\nto come to Imperial was a big issue\namong students, now they were\nhere. The academic standing was\nthe largest carrot hanging in front\nof prospective undergraduates.\nAnother reason was to be in\nLondon; the bright lights had held\nan attraction for many. It had\nfrequently been the deciding factor\nin the 'reputation' versus 'cost of\nliving' debate that most A level\nstudents go through when applying\nto London University. Although, I only found one Oxbridge reject in\nthe JCR, many, many more exist.\nI doubt if Imperial keeps records of\nthose who choose the dreaming\nspires and were handed down to\nLondon, but I believe they would\nmake interesting reading.\nStrangely, many questioned the\nchoice of studying at Imperial but\nfew regretted it. While everyone\nadmitted that the work- obsessed\nimage of IC students was justified,\nnot many wanted to leave. Noting\nthe more positive sides of the IC\nstereotype, Jamie (name and\ndepartment unknown) said students\nhere worked very hard and were\nmore highly motivated than at other\nNerds R Us militia\ncolleges.\nThose who did regret their choice\nappeared to be very bitter. Nadira\nAli, who had just finished her\nexams, complained about the level\nof work. 'Sometimes they go over\nthe top' she said, regretting that it\nwas easy for some: very clever\npeople don't need to work they just\nhave it in them, but not me, she\nadded. Luke from Management\nmoaned about 'freaky geeky\nstudents', the reason he was\nstudying here was as a victim of\n'geeky ness'. He wanting to be\ntaught at the best place,\nacademically, and now lamented it.\n'My personality doesn't gel', was\nhis attitude to how he fits in at\nImperial.\nThe only one to quarrel with the\nacademic reputation of IC was\nCaroline Mekesta. After negotiating\nan appearance fee for her comments\non Imperial, she criticised the lack\nof attention given to\nundergraduates. 'If you ask them\n(Lecturers) a question, they just\ndon't want to know'. Because\ncollege is too heavily geared\ntowards postgraduates, the\nacademic reputation wasn't justified, she concluded. She also\nhad a clear vision of the typical IC\nstudent: White, drinks lots of beer,\nis in the Rugby team, has\novergrown hair, but not as an\nimage, wears a heavy metal T shirt\nand doesn't know how to relate to\nwomen. Any one out there\ninterested in a hate/hate\nrelationship?\nWhat of the dreams of those in\nthe JCR? Being rich appeared a popular desire, but strangely\nhappiness was also a frequent reply.\nCould it be that the age of peace and\nlove is returning to student life? The\nother main wish was to get a good\ndegree. Only a few stood out from\nthe crowd, Bruce Patterson from\nComputing wanted a motor bike,\nhis most recent reading material had\nbeen On the Road by Jack Kerouac,\na connection perhaps? Most unusual\nof all, Julian, who declined to\nidentify himself further, wished to\nbe able to see into the future.\nMaybe this is bad time to take the\nopinions of students, exams are\nlooming, morale will be at a low.\nBut I cannot ignore the feeling that\nthe image of Imperial projected to\nthose under its influence is not all\nit could be. Can it be that students\nwhen they come here are unhappy,\nbut stick it out for the good of their\ncareers? Maybe the unfortunate\nstereotype that we all recognise is\nnecessary to preserve the\nintellectual standing of the College.\nBut the fact remains, the IC student\nis here in our midst, and we are not\nentirely happy about it.\nPage 8\n\n"
