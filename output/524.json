    "content": "A FILM FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WEEK\n\" THE CHINA SYNDROME\" by Mark Smith\nWhenever you tuck a switch to\nturn on a light, do you think of the\npossible consequences of what\nyou are doing? This is the\nquestion posed to us all, indirectly\n, in this interesting nuclear power\nthriller which is released to day.\nThe title refers to a term once\ncoined for the melt-down of a nuclear reactor. The plot thus\ncentres on the accidental discovery by a TV news team of a near disaster at an atomic power\nstation. Kimberly Wells (Jane\nFonda) is an ambitious news\nreporter caught between revealing the cover-up of the\naccident and losing her job, or\naccepting the s per fic i al assurances of the plant's public\nrelations officer. Her cameraman,\nplayed by producer Michael\nDouglas, is convinced that the\npublic should be told.\nJane Fonda & Michael Douglas plan their next shot in i he nuclear potter plant.\nA brilliant performance from Jack Lemmon\nstarring as Jack Godell.\nFurther complications arise; the\nbig business interests which built\nthe power station are seeking a licence for another and cannot\nafford expensive safety checks or\nany bad publicity. They resort to\nvio en ce to keep the story secret\nand push for the plant to be put\nback 'on line' as soon as possible,\nthus saving money and their\nreputation.\nJack. Lemmon plays a senior\nengineer, Jack Godell, who is\nsuspicious about the whole\nincident. His subsequent dealings\nwith both TV crew and company\nprovide the basis for the rest of\nthis interesting and topical movie.\nLemmon gives an extremely\nIt's all action!!\nconvincing performance in an\nunlikely role for him, displaying\nhis great flexibility as an actor.\nThe fj|m raises several\ninteresting questions, especially\nfor scientists. Can we afford a nuclear programme in which\nfinancial matters rather than\nsafety could possibly be of\npremier importance? Are the\npublic aware that switching on\nthat light gives them a form of\nresponsibility and should they\ntherefore be better informed?\nThis drama, although decidedly\nanti nuclear, gives no firm\nanswers and centres more on the\nSerious bus/new in the ob ser cali on booth\nemotional states of the people\ninvolved. I can only recommend it\nas a welcome escape from the\nbatch of sci-fi cowboys and\nIndians currently with us. It\ncontains some fine performances\nand can at least be taken\nseriously.\nFinally, with our own Environmental Week soon to\ncome, this film would provide an\ninteresting night out - especially if\nyou get bored with the arguments\nand debates at college!\n\n"

    "content": "CO.YTI.YL ED\nfrom front page.\nFees for postgraduates are being increased from \u00a3925 to\n\u00a31.230. for undergraduates from \u00a3705 to \u00a3940 an fj for non. advanced further education courses they will rise from \u00a3390 to \u00a3520. '\nIn his letter to Commonwealth Heads of Government sent to Lusaka last week via their Embassies in London, Trevor Phillips states: \"Britain\nhas. for many decades, been an\ninternational centre for pos l school\neducation, particularly attracting\nstudents from the Commonwealth\nand former British colonies.\nIndeed, many Heads of Government\nof Commonwealth countries are ex-students of British I'n ivers i lies themselves. We hold thai it is\nessential that overseas students\nmaintain free and open access lo\nBritish institutions for three major\nreasons:\nThe three reasons that Mr Phillips gives are that: education and scholarship should be available intern ation ally without monetary or political barriers, it is\nessential for developing countries to have access to\neducation and training opportunities in Britain; the presence of overseas students is\nol Crucial value in broadening the cultural experience of British students.\nLaunching theN US campaign to get the Conservative Government to\nchange its mind on overseas\nstudents, Mr Phillips said:\n\"Many people and their families\nhave devoted their lives lo gaining\ni he initial qualifications and\nsaving Ihe money necessary for a place in a British college because\nthere are no equivalent educational\nopportunities in their own\ncountries.\n'' We are not prepared to see the\nlives and potential careers of these\npeople wrecked. The issue we are\nraising is of fundamental\nimportance to Britain. It is not\nsimply a question o/ people going\nhungry or having lo do without\nhooks.\nDear Sir. - Iam horrified and\ndisgusted at the mean-spirited\nattitude adopted by the Union executive on the matter of next\nyear's FELIX Editor.\nTheir ultimatum to. or rather\n'dismissal of. John Shuttleworth\ncan only he seen as a misinterpretation of the facts\nsurrounding the case. In order for\ncriteria as to eligibility for a post\nto become law. they must be\nwritten into the laws or constitution of the body concerned, in this case the ByeLaws of ICL ni on. The criteria,\nhaving become law. must then be\nmade available to election\ncandidates and to the electorate\nat election times. Since the\ncriteria about 'good academic\nstanding' make no appearance in\nthe Bye-Laws, they were not\navailable in written form either to\nelection candidates or to the\nelectorate in the elections for\nFELIX Editor.\nAs one of the many voted for\nJohn Shuttleworth in the election,\nI would feel cheated if he were to\nbe removed from the post on some\nobscure piece of hearsay of which\nI was unaware at the time oi\nelection. It is rather like the Prime\nMinister dismissing an MP from\nthe House of Commons because\nhis her private business is not\ndoing too well.\nOf course, the Prime Minister\ncannot demand the resignation of\nan MP from the House of\nCommons (except in cases of\nserious misconduct). The only\nwav to remove an MP is by the\nballot. I mention this analogy\nbecause there is no difference\nbetween the situation described\nabove and the one regarding next\nyear's FELIX Editor. The important point in both cases is\nthat it is up to the electorate to\ndecide on a debatable issue and\nnot the executive. The only way\nto remove a FELIX Editor from\nOilice is, according to the ByeLaws, by a two-thirds majority at\ntwo L'n ion General Meetings.\nI hope that the executive will\nthink again before continuing\ntheir short-sighted policy on this\naffair. If they do not. the matter\nmust surely end up in the law\ncourts.\nRichard Earl( PG Affairs Officer)\nCOLLEGE\nHARDSHIP FUND\nAt the Governing Body\nmeeting on the last day of\nterm it was resolved that no\n'on course' students should be\nasked to leave if suffering\nfrom genuine financial hardship. A Hardship Fund\nwas therefore made provision\nfor.\nThough details are still\nsketchy, any queries should\nbe directed to Chris Fox, IC\nUnion President, int. 3915.\nJohn\nColin\nAN OFFICIAL EXEC. STATEMENT\nFOLLOWING THE failure of his second year\nMathematics examinations, John\nShuttleworth, who was elected FELIX Editor\nlast March, was deemed by College not to be\nof 'good academic standing'. This means that\nhe cannot be registered as a student for the\nsession 1979/80. He is barred from taking up\nthe Sabbatical by a College Governing Body\nregulation, which had been accepted by a Union General Meeting but had not been\nincorporated into the Union Blue Book.\nAfter taking all things into consideration,\nincluding the fact that the Sabbatical is tied to\nthe FELIX Editorship, Imperial College Union\nExecutive issued a statement deeming John\nShuttleworth to be ineligible to take up the\npost of FELIX Editor, and appointed Colin\nPalmer Acting Editor, as he was the runner-up in the original election.\nIC Union Executive\n8th August, 1979\nShuttleworth (left)\nPalmer (right)\n\n"

I thank John Shuttleworth for\nhelping me with this issue of FELIX. It is a shame that he should\nfind himself in a position where he could no longer continue as\nEditor. Harmony has not fully been restored and that is the reason\nwhy there are no contributions form Richard Earl. PG Group\nChairperson, although it would seem that he is willing for the copy\nto be transferred from John Shuttleworth to me.\nI plan to bring out one more FELIX during this vacation, (I need\nthe practice), on Friday September 14th. The copy deadline for\nthat issue will be 5.30pm on Monday September 10th. If you were\nincredulous about the strict observance of J. Harris deadlines then\nbe warned I intend to be as harsh over late copy .... with one\nexception. I will include a defaulter's page if vital copy\nwould otherwise be left out. However the humiliation of having an\narticle on the page should discourage all the I 'll do it presently'\npeople, who haven'ta clue how an issue is scheduled to get their\nproverbial digits out and copy in on time.\nFresher's issue deadline will be Monday September 17th. If you\nhave a legitimate excuse for handing it in late I will only accept it if\nyou inform me before the deadline because the Fresher's issue is\ngoing to be a large undertaking that has to be methodically\nscheduled.\nFor the next month the FELIX Office is going to be spruced up.\nSeveral litho jobs are coming in and its a good time to get posters\nand letter headers printed before the last minute rush.\nA surprisingly large number of people have helped produce this\nFELIX. Students have written postcards from exotic places in\nEurope (thanks but you make me jealous) while others have given\nmoral support during a difficult period.\nMark Smith - for helping just at crucial moments when more than\none job cropped up and of course his set of reviews.\nGill McConway - for rapid photo typesetting when all the copy\ncame in at once, and for resetting work when the machine decided\nto be naughty.\nIan Morse - for printing and good ideas for improving the\ndecoration of the FELIX Office.\nTansy & Mo - for their first theatre review. I'm looking forward to\nreading about Romeo and Juliet in the next issue.\nSean O 'Boyle - tor moral support and coffee.\nJill Dawson - for Day by Day\nRichard Earl - 'I don't like being called Chairperson ... call me\nchairman' has at last diverted his copy into this FELIX. He would\nlike to say that this does not represent a capitulation just common\nsense.\nJanet Sheppard - for writing from far off parts.\nMiss L Ewing - for the front page press release concerning the\ndeath of Professor Pryor.\nEric and Pinball - for music reviews.\nNUS especially Ian Coxon - for the Fees Campaign press release.\nDDA - lor help with film reviews especially for providing stills at\nshort notice.\nColumbia - EMI - Warner - for even more stills. Jon Firth - for help in producing this issue.\nChris Fox and the rest of the exec - when they finally produce their\nstatement .... They are here now so I 'll save my comments about\nthem for the next issue. They will have to learn that my deadlines\napply equally well to them. Malcolm reckons he'll be the\nfirst to use the defaulter's page .... I bet he won t get his copy in\neven in time for that.\nColin Palmer (Acting FELIX Editor)\nWARNING\nStudents should beware of a female\nthat is likely to approach them saying,\n\"I'm sorry I have missed my last tube.\"\nIt is rumoured that the girl is of foreign\nextraction and seems to be getting to\nknow postgraduates by working\nthrough the alphabetical list.\nUnconfirmed reports suggest that she\nis not dangerous but likes to enjoy\nherself.

The AHA decided at a meeting on Monday not to make the cuts that would be necessary if it were not to\noverspend its budget. It is estimated that\nabout \u00a35.5 millions would need to be cut\nas a result of inflation and the VAT increase and predicted that patients\nwould die as a result.\nNigerian BP nationalisation\nIn an apparently unique effort by\nWhitehall to save substantial oil rights,\nthe Foreign Office has instructed the\nacting High Commissioner in Lagos, Mr\nFrank Kennedy, to take up the matter\nwith the military government of General\nObasanjo.\nThe 40,000 tonnes of oil BP took from\nNigeria daily went almost entirely to its\nsubsidiaries in mainland Europe. Its\nsudden disappearance will cut supplies\nthere by about 15 per cent, unless BP is\nable to replace the oil by buying at\nhigher prices on the free markets, or by\ncutting back sales to other oil\ncompanies.\nThursday 2nd U.S. ban sale of arms to Ulster police\nA State Department spokesman said\nthat a review of American weapons\npolicy was underway and for the time\nbeing no weapons could be exported for\nthe Royal Ulster Constabulary. The move was prompted by\nallegations that political detainees have\nbeen mistreated during interrogation.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary, Mr\nHumphrey Atkins responded by saying\nthat there was no question of the RUG being left short of the weapons they\nneed to fight terrorism.\nMorcambe and Wise\nA secret TV tribute is being compiled\nby the BBC which will be screened when\nthey retire. The BBC believes that Eric\nMorecambe, recovering from major\nopen-heart surgery, may well leave the\npartnership this year.\nThe two comedians were surprised\nwhen they heard the news of the tribute.\nErnie Wise said, \"I'm sure we shall come\nback. My understanding is that as soon\nas Eric feels up to it we'll be together\nagain, and I haven't heard anything to\nthe contrary.\"\nA BBC TV spokesman said that some\npreliminary work is being done on\npresenting a suitable programme in the\nevent of Morecambe and Wise giving up\nshow business. \"It is normal journalistic practice. We\nhear that Eric is progressing\nsatisfactorily and this is one programme\nwe hope won't go out.\"\nFriday 3rd Thatcher avoids Commonwealth split\nA serious split at the Commonwealth\nConference was avoided by a speech by\nMrs Thatcher in support of changes in\nthe Zimbabwe-Rhodesia constitution.\nShe put forward four points as a basis\nfor a settlement acceptable to the\nAfrican members of the Common wealth. The main point is that the\namended Zimbabwe Rhodesia constitution should be comparable with\nthose agreed with other former colonies.\nAll fingers and thumbs\nSurgeons in Aberdeen have fashioned a pair of thumbs for a three-year-old who was born without any.\nIn a series of operations over eight\nmonths a medical team fashioned the\nthumbs from the toes of one foot - the\nfirst time this is believed to have been\ndone anywhere in the world.

The accident laid\nwaste large areas of territory in the Urals\nand caused many deaths.\nGossip columnist to sue proprietor\nNigel Dempster of the Daily Mail is to\ntake legal action against his proprietor,\nLord Rothermere, who described his\nwork as having 'the taste of an old, cold\nfried potato.'\nAt his Chelsea mansion, where he\nlives with his wife, Lady Camilla\nOsborne, daughter of the late Duke of\nLeeds, Dempster was adamant that he\nintends to see 'justice done'.'At the\nmoment the Daily Mail needs me more\nthan I need them .... morale in the office\nis low.'\nJill Dawson Sunday 5th Pound falls\nWholesale prices, which will affect\nshop prices within a few months, rose by\n2.25 per cent in July. The inflationary\ntrend hit the pound, which fell by 3 cents\nagainst the dollar.\nThe figures indicate an underlying\nannual inflation rate of 13.5 per cent,\ncompared with less than twelve per cent\nin June - but this is bound to worsen\nconsiderably as the full impact of petrol-product price rises takes effect and the\nincrease in VAT is reflected in the index,\npossibly putting it up by 3 per cent in\nAugust.\nA crumb of comfort for the\nGovernment comes from a slight fall - of\n1 3/4 per cent - in the prices of non-oil\nbased commodities bought by\nmanufacturing industry - particularly\ncopper, lead, wood pulp and hides.\nMonday 6th Muzorewa insulted\nBishop Muzorewa said it was \" an\ninsult to the electorate and the\ngovernment of this country\" that new\nelections were proposed.

Student resigns from university\nA Cambridge graduate is reported to\nhave made thousands of pounds in\nprofit by 'borrowing' books from the\nuniversity library and then selling them\nto London dealers for upwards of\n\u00a325,000.\nResigning from the university,\nthough, which involves the expunging of\nyour name from the records and the\ncancelling of all your degrees, is only\navailable at the would-be re signer's request.\nEven then, it has to be approved by the\nuniversity council, whose members\nmust be convinced that the reasons are\ngood enough. And until 1974 the step\nwas actually impossible.\nThis unusual protection of a student's past ache ive ment s, even from\nhimself, was changed in 1974 during a suitably bizarre one-man campaign. Mr\nSadar Tejendrasingh, a Cambridge MA\nwho wap ted to end all his links with the\nuniversity and with British authorities\ngenerally, broke university windows,\nassaulted an administration messenger\nand smashed a postal weighing machine\nin the Old Schools to promote his cause.\nTuesday 7th India save test\nCenturies by Dilip Vengsarkar and\nGundappa Viswanath, plus delays for\nrain, helped India save the second\nCornhill Test against England at Lords.\nIndia needing 323 to stop an innings\ndefeat, had made 318 for four when play\nended.\nEtna eruption\nPolice and troops were alerted as the\nunpredictable eruption of Mount Etna,\nEurope's largest volcano , continued.\nToday, a new crater opened about 3,000\nfeet up the 10,958ft mountain.

Animals sensed quake before it struck\nAnimals in a safari park near the\nepicentre of the moderately strong\nearthquake which shook San Francisco\nand northern California behaved\nerratically for hours before the tremors\nwere felt by people.\nTheir behaviour, observed by many\nfull-time keepers and trainers, supports\nthe belief that animals are sensitive to\nseismic activity.\nThe park's spokeswoman said that a cougar had been very restless and\npadded about most of the night, while a baby tiger- \"normally very nice\" - had\nremained curled up in a corner all day,\nrefusing to respond to friendly\napproaches.\n\"Then about five minutes before the\nearthquake occurred, one of our trainers\nwas trying to trim the toenail of an\nelephant, but the elephant wouldn't let\nhim do it,\" she said.\n\"Normally the elephant is very\ngentle. It went back and banged the door\naround and began trumpeting when the\nquake occurred.\"\nOther animals grouped with their\nown kind during the earthquake-Zebras\nwith Zebras, deer with deer and so on,\nand they all remained standing up\nduring the jolting.\n\"Half an hour afterwards everything\nwas back to normal as though nothing\nhad happened.\"\n\n"

Sally Field, in the title\nrole, gives a very convincing\nportrayal of a tough young\nwoman and her struggle for\nfreedom. For this performance\nshe deservedly won the best\nactress award at the Cannes Film\nFestival this year.\nNorma Rae is a widowed\nmother whose life centres on the\nlocal cotton mill, a gruesome\ncollection of clattering machinery\nwhich is the only industry in the\ntown. Her life changes when she\nmeets Reuben, a Jewish New\nYorker, who wishes to introduce a trades union to the mill. He meets\nopposition not only from the\nmanagement, but also from the\nemployees with their fears and\nprejudices. Ron Leibman, in the\nrole of Reuben, gave an equally\nconvincing performance as the\nstrange man with big ideas and a lot of drive; a man unlike any\nNorma Rae has encountered\nbefore.\nNorma marries Sonny (Bean\nBridges) but soon runs into\ntrouble by over involving herself\nwith the union. The plot is a little\nslow, but this is a deliberate\nexpression of the reality of the\nwhole situation. Particularly impressive are the factory scenes\nwhich reminded me more of the\nVictorian era, rather than modern\nday America. The const at FILM\nREVIEW\npounding of machinery and blank\nfaces of the almost robotic\nworkers convey a sense of shame;\ndo people really work under these conditions?\nDespite its faults this film is a meaningful and worthwhile experience. Not full of 'thrills and\nspills', it effectively blends actors\nand scenery to produce an image\nof reality; a frightening image.\nThis is a film to be enjoyed at\nleisure.\nMark Smith\nNEXT\nFELIX\nFRIDA Y SEPT\n14th Copy date Monday\nSeptember 10th "

Almost hall' the 85,000\noverseas students in Britain arc from Commonwealth countries.\nNUS is also mounting a campaign to ensure that no\noverseas student is forced to\nleave or turn down a place in\na British college because of financial hardship. \"We will be prepared lo back direct\naction such as occupations called by\nlocal student unions where they are\nnecessary lo secure adequate money\nfor hardship funds,\" NUS President Trevor Phillips said\nwhen he named Sunday7 th October1979 as the day for a special national conference of student union officers to\ndiscuss the problem. In June, the Conservative Government announced an extra20 per cent increase in overseas tuition fees on top of the nine per cent increase for\nthe 1979/80 academic year\nannounced by the Labour Government earlier in the\nyear. It has also been suggested recently that overseas student fees should be\nraised even higher. Icontinued on page 2)\n\n"

    "content": "HAMLET\nat the Old Vic\nThis production of Hamlet\nwith Derek Jacobi in the title role\nfor the second time, is heading for\na well deserved international tour\nincluding Elsinore itself, Greece,\nChina, Japan and Australia. Very\nlittle was cut from this superb\nproduction making it a long but\nenjoyable evening despite the\ncramped conditions in an\notherwise fine old theatre, the set\nwas very simple; the scenery\nconsisting only of two portraits,\none of old Hamlet and one of\nClaudius, so that a continuous\ncomparison could be made by the\naudience and effective use made\nby the characters, Hamlet in\nparticular. This gave a very\nShakespearean atmosphere with\ncostumed stage hands employed\nin moving the major props\nbetween scenes.\nAn original beginning introduced us to the four major\ncharacters moving across the\nsmokey stage and highlighted in\npairs and singly in spotlights. This\npromised a well produced and\ninteresting performance: we were\nnot disappointed. Lighting and\nmusic were both used to good\neffect, particularly on the castle\nbattlements where the ghost's presence was indicated by the\nmournful notes of a flute. One\nmusician who stood out was\nguitarist Alan Lawrence, amongst\nthe players who accompanied the\nHecuba speech and the \"Mousetrap\" play\u2014 an\nunfortunate name considering\nAgahtha Christie's long runner,\nwhich raised a titter from the\naudience.\nDerek Jacobi gave a brilliant\nperformance (surprise, surprise!)\nas expected from this experienced actor although I felt\nthat his mad fit following his\nmeeting with the ghost was rather\noverdone with Jacobi rolling on\nthe stage in an imitation of a childish tantrum. This is the only\ncriticism I had and it was forgotten\nafter the famous \"To be or not to\nbe\" soliloquy and the following\nspeech with Ophelia which was in\nmy opinion the best scene of the\nnight.\nRobert Eddison, as Polonius,\nalso gave an outstanding performance with just the right\namount of self\u2014opinion ation to\nprovide humour in this tragic play. The only major criticism of\nthe play was the character is ation of Gertrude, played by Brenda\nBruce, who did not show as much\naffection towards Hamlet as was\nexpected, although her performance was up to< the\nstandard expected at the Old Vic.\nAltogether, we both enjoyed\nour first op pur t unity to review,\nalthough we had a momentary\nworry following Laetes and\nOphelia's passionate embrace on\nstage \u2014 is incest contagious?\nTansy Hepton and Mo Misra\nNeon Harts\nPopular Music\ntime waits for no one - in a way\nthis reminds me of how the two\nunicorns f let as they watched the\nark float away: behind an\nincredibly badly designed new-wave-can h in-a Hempt-at-street credibility/ notoriety-and-today-relevance cover lurks very little at\nall apart from a further attempt by\n'living legends' at a fast buck - the\ncover nays: anthology 1971-1977:\ncompilations are rarely anything\nbut disappointments: this conforms - with the possible\nexceptions of 'fool to cry' and the\nlive 'if you can't rock me / get off\nmy cloud', bluntly it sucks:\nposterity will hardly be kind to this\n'record' - the validity is minimal -which is fairly lucky as it almost\nperfectly matches the musical\ncontent : add to jagger has never\nsung worse - ok, maybe 'way back\nwhen' the stones were a 'force to\nbe reckoned with' - not au th ology19711977 there is very little to be said for\nthis album\nian v wie cz or ck Time waits for no man\n- Rolling Stones\nAs a complete contrast, this\nalbum is fun, varied, interesting,\nand can even be listened to right\nthrough. (Latest score Neon\nHearts 4, Rolling Stones 0). Neon\nHearts are a new band, this being\ntheir first album. They play music\na couple of inches outside the\nRezillos, sort of poppy, avar te garde, new wave whatever that\nmight be.\nThe vocalist, Tone Dial,( 'honest officer its me real name')\nsounds like a more adventurous,\nand more powerful Robin Scott\n('M' you ignorant \u2014's). Keith\nAllen, drums, and Steve Heart,\nsax, are the other heroes. Paul\nRaven, bass, performs somewhere between solid and inspired,\nand Martin Ratcliffe, guitar, never\nlets the side down, giving an\noverall impression of tightness\nand originality. The production\nseems very rough, but it is always\nappropriate (Neon Hearts 8\nRolling Stones 0).\nSo! an excellent album from the\ntasteful pink and black cover to\nthe essential little round hole in\nthe middle. Best tracks? Irrelevant\n(Neon Hearts 10 Rolling Stones\n0 Match Abandoned as a no\ncontest Neon Hearts to play\nwinners of Led Zepellin vs PIL in\nthe next round)\nNeon Eric\nAlbum Review\nThe London Concert\"\nby Dave J ago One of the reasons that Oscar\nPeterson's playing has never\nparticularly appealed to me is that\nhe seems to play with a complete\nlack of emotion. The impression\nhas been fueled by watching him\nplaying happily away to an\nenthusiastic audience in the\nsafety and comfort of his own\ntelevision chat show. It is a well\nknown fact, amongst we traditionalists at least, that the\nbest jazz can only be played by\npenny less, homeless, unloved\n('My baby done left me ...') down\nand outs, preferably on the verge\nof catching pneumonia or going\ninsane. On this double album,\nhowever, recorded live at the\nRoyal Festival Hall last year,\nPeterson quite ex cells himself,\nplaying with a surprising fire and\npassion.\nHaving said that, perhaps I had\nbetter make it clear that this is not\njust a record of Oscar Peterson\naccompanied by bass and drums,\nbut of a trio in the proper sense of\nthe word. All three instruments\ntake an equally important part in\nthe proceedings. Louis Bellson,\non drums, is known to many\nthrough his work with big bands,\nalthough he is in fact no stranger\nto small group playing. His\ndrumming is always well considered, and his short solo\nspots manage to be totally\nstunning, whilst remaining fully\nintegrated within the musical\ncontext. The drum choruses in\n'Sweet Georgia Brown' have to be\nheard to be believed - no boring\nextended ego trips here!\nJohn Heard, on bass, produces\na much grittier, and to my mind\nbetter, tone than does Nick\nPeterson, who is Petersons\nregular bass player. Heard's bouncy, angular style matches\nthe flu an cy of the piano lines\nbeautifully. Peterson himself, of\ncourse, plays with sheer technical\ngenius. The rendition of 'Sweet\nGeorgia Brown,' one of the standout tracks on the album, is\nnothing short of incredible, and\nthe ease with which he changes\nfrom style to style, bouncing from\nstride into bebop in the space of a few seconds, is sometimes breathtaking.\n\n"
