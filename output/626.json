    "content": "WAIKA80UTLOOHSEC\nby Mobile Optics Inc. ,\nARTE\nITALIANA\nat the Hayward Gallery\nGetting There \"\nThe Hayward Gallery is part of the South Bank\ncomplex, which also includes the Royal Festival\nHall (concerts), the National Theatre (plays)\nand the National Film Theatre (favourable rates\nfor student members). The closest tube station\nis Waterloo. Going from College, the trip involves changing from the District or Circle line\nto the Northern or Bakerloo, to get from\nEmbankment to Waterloo. If it's a nice day, I The South Bank complex is built of mud-coloured concrete. From outside it looks a cross between an architecturally significant\nblockhouse and an overgrown rabbit-warren.\nIt works far better inside: the bare concrete is\nan equally appropriate setting for the plush\nseating and carpets fo the auditoria and the\npale, polished floors of the Hayward Gallery.\nArte Italiana 1960-82\nThe exhibition of contemporary Italian art at\nthe Hayward is the largest ever staged outside\nItaly. About eighty artists are represented. The\nexhibit on has been organised by the City of\nMilan and the works on view were selected by a panel of five Italian critics: their combined\nviewpoint has, no doubt, biased the selection,\nthough to what extent I'm not really qualified\nto judge.\nA small pamphlet listing the artists' names\nand giving a plan of the exhibition will be\nhanded to you with your ticket. Further background may be gleaned from the\ncatalogue. But the exhibition is an immediately\nenjoyable one, even without delving into the\nwhys and wherefores of each of the works on\nshow.\nSort of chronological order:\nThe show begins in a small darkened room\nwith a set of UV lamps. Pink and green\ncomponent! vi ria bil i and it moves!\nThe section of Italian pop art also has great\nstyle and appeal. 'Curves at man's level' is a5m long crucifix (?), laid flat on the floor\u2014but\nHe's assembled out of vertical-sided plants,\nlike a low-resolution contour map. 'L 'atelier\nrecommend you save the hassle of changing\nlines for one stop and get out at Embankment\n(as shown in sketch map). Hungerford Bridge\nis a railway bridge with a pedestrian footpath;\nfrom it there's a good view of the South Bank,\nof Cleopatra's Needle (on Victoria Embankm ent, just in front of the Embankment Gardens) and, looking downstream, of the\ndome of St Paul's Cathedral.\nfluorescent dots make lines which appear to\nrecede far beyond the corners of the room.\nEmerging, back into 'gallery light', a series of\nAchrome works by Piero Manzoni delight in\nthe tactile appeal of polystyrene pellets, glass\nwool and suchlike unexpected materials.\nArte cine tica is kinetic art. Press the button\nand watch it dazzle/pulsate/twitch/flutter...\nsyl ish coffee-table art!\nRouge' is a vast jigsaw, a brightly coloured\nhomage to Matisse containing references to\nhis portraits, nudes and de coup ages. In 'New- and Lyrical-Abstraction' traditional\npainting materials are used. Traditional pictures invite the eye to penetrate their\ninteriors and to explore from the surface to the\nillusory depths. These pictures either deny the\nillusion of spatial recession entirely or, acknowledging that absolute flatness in\npainting is impossible to achieve, they\nexperiment with exclusively visual sensations\nof depth. Carlo Battaglia's 'Ultramarine 3' uses\npurple, gold and pink to produce an illusion of\ndepth; his waves are definitely not solid and yet\nseem to shrink into the distance. Another\nenormously powerful effect is created by\nClaudio Olivieri. His pictures are very dark,\nand the variations of colour and tone\nextremely subtle. Given time for the eye to\nadjust, the deep burgundy and blue-green\nbecome 'live' and the canvas quivers and\nbegins to undulate.\nPerhaps the most exciting section is that of\n' Nu ove Tend enz e'. Italian art is stylish,\nexuberant and bursting with talent and experiment. I particularly liked Aldo Spoldi's 'Adventures of Gordon Py m'n, which are\ndelightful, easy to appreciate and eminently\ncove table! Where, when, \u00a3?\nArte Italiana 1960-82 is on at the Hayward\nGallery until January9, MonS at and on\nSunday afternoons, admission80 p for\nstudents.\nPogeTO November 5, 19821 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Disgusting!\nThat's the official RCS opinion of a Mooney\nFreshers' Dinner, as Stephen Goulder\ncomplains of 'Gristle in Dubious Sauce'.\nThe Royal College of Science\nUnion may refuse to pay the full\namount for the physics fresher s' dinner, after complaints of\ndisgusting food and poor service.\nTC Union President Stephen\nGoulder, who was a guest at the\ndinner, referred to the main\ncourse (described on the menu as\n'veal fricassee') as 'gristle in\ndubious sauce'. There was also a shortage of waiters, the food was\nserved cold and diners were\nrationed to one glass of wine\neach. Mr Goulder later criticised\nthe Union for selecting a meal\nthat \"Mooney can't cook\".\nChas Fuller, the R CSU Honorary Secretary, told FELIX that he had written to Refectory\nManager Victor Mooney in July\nmaking arrangements for all the\ndinners, and that Mr Mooney had promised to write back with\ncomments and suggestions for\nmenus. He has not heard from\nthe Refectories since, and he has\nstill not even received official\nconfirmation of the prices, although the bills for the other\nfresher s' dinners have already\narrived.\nR CSU officials are awaiting\nreaction from the 120 people\nwho paid \u00a36.50 for the physics\ndinner, before reaching a decision\non whether or not to pay next\nweek.\n...and a good\njob too!\nIndustrial Society's Careers Fair\non Wednesday turned out to be\nthe big success it promised to be,\nwith the JCR full of companies\nand students.\nThe standard of the displays\nvaried widely from full blown\naudiovisual and computer demonstrations from the larger\ncompanies to hand written signs\nand xerox ed handouts from the\nsmaller fry. All the students\ntalked to considered it useful to\nbe able to chat with representatives of the companies, including\nrecent graduates working for\nthat company on some stalls.\nMany left the J CR loaded down\nwith information and promising\nto return for another bout in the\nafternoon.\nJohn Barrett, vice chairman of\nIndustrial Society said that all\nbad gone well and that all the\ncompanies billed in FELIX had\nturned up together with a few\nextras. Mr Barrett thanked\nFELIX for printing the extra\ncopies of last week's guide to the\nfair. Unfortunately some bemused recipients of the guide\nwere confused by the Mata Hari\nreview which was on the same\npage, and were obviously disappointed that Lena Lo vich wasn't one of the attractions.\nPage2 MM BM HMM H H1K Fire in Selkirk\nA number of posters on the walls\nof Selkirk Hall were set on fire\nduring a party on Saturday\nevening.\nAs well as being indirect violation of Union pub li city rules, this caused a serious\nfire hazard. Hall Sub-Warden\nKen Baldwin has said that whoever was responsible will\nprobably face expulsion from\nHall if his identity is disclosed.\nKarl Schmidt: the next Spanner\nbearer?\nKarl Schmidt a Guildsman\nKarl Schmidt, the President of the Royal College of Science\nUnion, is officially a member of City and Guilds Union, it was\nrevealed at the Me chEng dinner\non Monday. Mr Schmidt, who has studied\nchemistry for two years, is now\ncompleting his joint honours course in the management science department which is\naffiliated to City and Guilds College. Under the union constitution, if he had wished to remain a member of R CSU he\nshould have informed the Honorary Secretaries of both\nunions in writing. This he has\nnot done, and Chas Fuller, the\nRCS UH on Sec, is now em powered to refuse Mr Schmidt\nadmission to all further R CSU meetings until the matter is\nsorted out.\nDrinking and\nDriving\nThree members of City and' Guilds Motor Club are looking\nfor sponsorship to take part in the Beaujolais Rally later this\nmonth. They have already been\nloaned a car by British Leyland.\nThe three motorists\u2014Chris\nBallard, John Ve dy and Martin Kist \u2014 Hope to raise in excess of \u00a3500 for the Bromley Mentally\nHandicapped Society, but are\nreluctant to use any of this money to cover their costs, which include a \u00a3160 entry fee.\nThey are therefore approaching\nlocal wine firms to raise the rest\nof the money.\nThe Rally is a traditional event; 150 cars will start from a vineyard near Lyon at midnight\non Sunday November 14 and the\naim is to bring a bottle of Nouveau Beajolais to England on the 8:00am Boulogne ferry,\ncovering as short a distance as\npossible. Because the tight schedule involves an eight-hour\nnon-stop, high-speed journey,\nthey will be driving a modified\nRover 2300S loaned to them by\nBritish Leyland Promotions.\nThe rally is the traditional\npreserve of wealthy drivers with\na taste for wine. Because of the\nhigh cost of participating, the\nevent finishes in true style with a champagne lunch at the Hotel\nMetropolis Brighton\nA typical scene at the Careers Fair\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 I November 5, 19821\nPhoto: Peter Hobbis\nFEU X "

That over the summer vacation the linen service hitherto provided in Student Halls and Houses was discontinued.\n2. That the removal of this service constitutes a hidden\nrent increase.\n3. That the desc is ion to remove the service was taken by\nthe Union Council in collusion with College Authorities without prior consultation of the student body.\nICU Believes:\n1. The linen service was a valuable one and should not\nhave been removed.\n2. The present laundry facilities in Halls and Houses are\nwoefully inadequate and students will be forced to wash\ntheir linen at expensive launder et tes. That the excuse of economy that the Union Executive and\nCollege will use to defend their high handed and\nautocratic behaviour is merely a cover for in com pet ance and inefficiency. ICU Instructs:\nThe ICU President to ne go cia te the reinstatement of the\nlinen service under the following conditions:-i) A new more economical deal is ne go cia ted with a laundry.\nii) The administration of the system is rationalized to cut\nout waste and inefficiency. Introductory Arrangements.\nI presented a paper to Board of Studies concerning the\ntime-tabling of courses for the first two days of term. The\npaper was noted and Board of Studies reaffirmed its commitment for two free days at the start of each session.\nUGM Publicity/Exec News.\nThis is now being done by Nick Pyne.\nUnion Directory.

This event went very smoothly (!) thanks to a strong team\neffort from Jo, Jen, Chris Teller, Jo Claydon, Gaynor Lewis\nand John Passmore.\nAMMENDMENT TO THE EMERGENCY MOTION TO REINSTATE THE LINEN\nSERVICE.\nProposed by: Stephen Goulder.\nSeconded by: Jon Barnett.\nDelete all and insert: ICU Notes:\n1. Had the linen service been retained, the rent increase\nfor the session would have been 8%.\n2. The increase in rents for the session was not more than\n4% in any of the Halls or Houses.\n3. The new scheme run by the Southside wardens costs about\n30p.a week and provides a full service.4. Further laundry facilities have been ordered,\ninstallation to depend on the date of completion of the\ncentral laundry.\n5. The proposed termination of the linen service was\nreported to the U. G.M. on the 4th of May, and to the\nA.G.M. on the 25th May.\nICU Believes:\n1. The various levels of service offered in the Halls\nshould be examined at the end of the year and the most\nappropriate service implemented in all the Halls in the\nfuture.\n\n"

    "content": "OPINION\nContinuing FELIX'S tradition of providing a 'soapbox' platform for anyone to express their\nopinion, Michael Newman, Life Sci 1, gives his\nthoughts on human violence.\nA Misused\nFiling Cabinet\nOn a Panorama programme some months ago several IRA terrorists\nwere interviewed. One had murdered a policeman. When asked why, he\nreplied that he had not seen a man but a uniform. He had destroyed an\nenemy, a blue uniform, a label. He had reduced human beings to\nsimplistic labels, this rejection of their humanity enabling him to justify\nhis act of cold-blooded murder. On October 26 1982 it was reported\nthat two Catholics and a Protestant had been killed; did their murderers\nsee them as human beings or labels?\nHomo sapiens are thinking\nanimals, we are investigators,\nseekers of knowledge and understanding, class if i ers. We\nclassify everything. As scientists\nmost of us should realise that\nclassification is a useful and\nnecessary tool, that it involves\nexact and strict rules and definitions. It is used to simplify,\norder, show relationships and as\na result to explain and under-stand. We all use the technique\nof labelling, we use the scientific\nsystem but most importantly we\nuse labels to classify ourselves.\nWe classify ourselves according to the colour of our skins,\nwhere we were born, our ages,\nour political and religious beliefs, the months in which we\nwere born, our sex. We might be\ndivided from people we might\notherwise have befriended. We\nmight hate people we might\notherwise have liked. We might\nignore people that we might\notherwise have listened to. We\nmight threaten people with a terrifying destruction to whom\nwe might otherwise have offered\nkindness and love. We might kill\nthose who we might otherwise\nhave saved.\nWhen we use labels on human\ngroups we tend to forget that we\nare using a scientific tool, a simplification. We actually\nconceive and talk of the label as\nif it exists in itself. In our\ndescription of world affairs we\ntalk of Russia, America and\nChina. We give these terms,\ncharacters. We create out of\nmillions of people an entity. The\nde human ising label, the mental\nconversion of many individual\nhuman beings into a single\nentity, an entity with its own\nbehaviour patterns and chara c Michael Newman\nter is tics. A thing that can easily\nbe attributed with any evil\nintention or act. A thing that is\nnot discriminating between\ninnocent and guilty, between\nhelpless and strong, between\ncivilian and military, between\nindividuals. We fanta s is e about\nBears, Bulldogs, Dragons, Reds\nWe psycho analyse these crea-ture s, we speak of them and their\npossible behaviour.\nUsing 'vandal is tic' classification we reject the individuality of\nthe members of the groups we\nlabel; we only see the label itself,\nthe tag is not a mere simplification but a 'reality'. We do not\nsee or speak of human beings,\nwe ignore their humanity. It is so\nmuch easier on the conscience to\nspeak of destroying mere labels.\nIndeed without this dream of the filing cabinet our so-called\njustification for murder, indiscriminate killing, nuclear war\nwould be seen to be what they\nreally are: empty, dangerous and\nunethical.\nIt has been said that nuclear\nweapons are immoral, it has\nbeen said that our nature is one\nof violence, and therefore we are\nnot responsible for the present\nappalling situation. Our nature\nis not one of violence but one\nof thought; how else could we\nhave the ingenuity and yet the\nstupidity to build these weapons?\nEveryone seems to condemn\nnuclear weapons; I do not. No object can be immoral, we\ncannot shift the resp on sib lit y onto the bombs themselves.\nThey are not evil or dangerous,\nit is the attitude that results in\npeople building them, planning\ntheir use, paying for them,\nintending to use them and justifying their use. It is us and\nthe arguments we advocate.\nSome people propose that it is\nimpossible to d is invent nuclear\nweapons, so what? Ignorance is\nnot the solution to the problem,\nknowledge has no dangers. It is\nits application that we must be\nwary of. The danger lies in what\nwe use the knowledge for, not\nthe knowledge itself.\nThere are many people in this\nworld who believe the in disc ri mate slaughter of millions of\nhuman beings is justifiable,\nthey, metaphorically, each hold a pistol to the head of a young,\ndefenceless, innocent child. This\nchild could be yours, it would\nnot matter to the person whose\nfinger is on the trigger. I ask you\nis the gun the problem? If we\nwere to disarm the person surely\ns/ he could use another gun or\nweapon or even their bare\nhands. The child would not be\nsafe. The only solution would be\nto persuade the intended murderer that there is no justification to kill the child and therefore no justification to\nthreaten its life. I ask you to\nrenounce your justification and\nto persuade others that there are\nno reasons to kill the innocent.\nYOUR F1N&ER ON THE\nTRIG-G ER.\nWe threaten the indiscriminate\nmass murder of a whole nation,\nof the people of a continent. We\nuse the same de human is ation that Hitler used in his slaughter\nof the Jewish people. We dwell\nin a horrifying dream world. In\nour nightmares we turn \"nations\ninto regiments of ghosts\" (J Bronowski). Will we ever wake\nup? Will you ever understand?\nPage6 November 5,1982 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Bar Accounts\nFor many years now Mr Roy Francis, a lecturer in the department of computing, has\nbeen pressing for' open bar accounts'. This controversy has\nbeen reopened recently after Mr Francis's removal from the bar\ncommittee and Colin Cooper has proposed a motion on this\nissue which will be discussed at\nTuesday's U GM. But before opinions are put forward, it might be as well to clear up some\nof the misconceptions about the\nbars and their accounting procedure.\nThe bars in IC are all run by\nCollege. Non e of them has any\nconcern with the Union's money\nexcept in so far as students drink\nthere. Policy for the bars is\ndetermined by the Refectory Committee, a College committee\nchaired by Dr Bob Schroter and\nEDITORIAL\nincluding among its members\nthree student representatives. But the Refectory Committee\ntakes recommendations on bar\npolicy from the Bar Subcommittee which, although it is a subcommittee of a College committee, is traditionally chaired by a Union Officer, currently Stephen Gould er,IC U President.\nThe bar subcommittee, in common with many organisations, produces both financial\nand management accounts, and there is an important distinction\nto be drawn between the two. Financial accounts are the statements which an organisation makes to the public to inform them of its monetary\ndealings throughout the year: its\nprofit or loss, its ownership of assets, its liabilities and so on and so forth. IC is required by\nlaw annually produce a set\nof financial accounts, to have\nthem audited and to make them\npublic, and these are the accounts\nwhich give the figures quoted in the first paragraph of Jon Stanley's letter.\nThe management accounts are\na much more detailed act of accounts whose purpose is not to\ninform the public, but to enable\nthe management (the Refectory\nCommittee in this case) to best\ndecide on policy. IC bars' management accounts are made\navailable to the Refectory Committee and to most members\nof the bar subcommittee, in clu ding Stephen Gould er, but not\nRoy Francis.\nSo if the financial accounts\nmake it clear that there is no question of anything illicit going\non, and management accounts\nare not intended to be public\nanyway, why all the fuss?\nThe answer is that there doesn't seem to be any reason\nfor not disclosing them. Management accounts are normally kept secret to avoid disclosing\ninformation to competitors, but\nthis is irrelevant in our case. Mr Gould er says that details of industrial staff wages and bonuses must be kept discreet,\nand of course this is true; but it\nwouldn't take much to add the\nfigures together under the WHEN Hfc iS Mt CRow K vED^1 HoM Ifv WP \u2022g fej_ QC KT \u20acX>\" feet x gf 'BfejT IN.,\nTuE VfD F loT) i MeM^iON1 \u2022 1\nheading 'salaries'. John Stanley\nasserts that it would be inconvenient to compile the in form a tion; not so, since it is already\ncompiled for the Refectory Committee. And the other excuses offered are so astonish-ingly woolly that they really make you wonder what's being\nhidden: \" The accounts would be\nopen to misinterpretation by people who would not understand them,\" and\" There is no need to disclose the accounts\nbecause Nick Morton has assured\nus that everything is okay.\" The financial accounts make it\nclear there are inefficiencies in the way the bars are run, and because of stonewalling from College over the management\naccounts one cannot say just\nwhere they lie, and so cannot\nsuggest improvements.\nBut in his election manifesto\nStephen Gould er promised to\nbring the Union Refectory under\nstudent control. The Union Refectory is no more, but couldn't Stephen adapt his policy to bring one or more of the bars under student control?\nFire Doors\nLast week's Below the Belt made\nan obscure reference to fire\ndoors in the Huxley Building being locked after7:00 pm. Unknown to FELIX staff, the\nSafety Officer in the Department\nof Computing, Iain Stinson, was\ndiscussing this very point with\nGeoffrey Reeves, head of security\n(see the news story on page three) and happily now all has\nbeen sorted out in the Huxley Building.\nSo I turned my attention to\nSouthside, where there are two\nfire doors on every landing, each\nwith a notice: ' Fire Door, do not\nwedge open'. Despite this warning and the inherent danger,\nI checked twenty-four doors and found nineteen of them wedged\nback. Don't you have any regard\nfor your own safety?\nImpossible Without\nLee Pad don, Nick Bedding, and Peter Rodgers for reviews.

    "content": "Bar Accounts\nDear Martin\nI would like to comment on\nthe inaccuracies contained within your news story concerning the College Bars.\nThe Bar Accounts are fully\naudited each year, and, as UGC accounts, pass through the Office of the Auditor General.\nThe accounts are also presented\nto Governing Body and the Finance and Executive Commit tee of College. The day-to-day\nbar accounts are seen by myself\nand the trends are looked at.\nThese are, however, management\naccounts and deal with with the\npersonal performance of mem-be rs of staff, their wages, bonuses, etc, all of which must\nbe kept discreet. I agree with\nNick Morton that as long as a student sees these accounts we\nshould be satisfied.\nYou also comment on the Bar Committee's terms of reference\nand membership. We have two\nstudent representatives( John McCallion and John Passmore),\nin addition I amBar Committee\nChairman appointed by Refectory Committee Chairman( Dr Bob Schroter). This has always\nbeen the case. At no stage has a student ever had the right to be\nchairman, it has always been a convention (this was affirmed at\nthe last revision of the membership of Bar Committee in1980). The changes to the existing(1977) terms of reference will ir\nno way effect the operation oi\nBar Committee as a policy body\nadvising Refectory Committee.\nYours sincerely\nStephen Goulder\nDear Sir\nIn 1981 IC's bars made a profit\nof \u00a313,000 on sales of \u00a3271,000.\nIn the same period the University\nof London Union's bar was three times more profitable, making a profit of \u00a318,000 on sales of \u00a3122,00 a profit equal to\n1 5 % of sales compared with College's5%.ULU achieved its\nhigh profits even though its\nprices were actually cheaper\nthan those at IC. The accounts show the major\nreason for the low profitability\nof bars in College was high staffing costs; 8 0 % of gross\nprofits were spent in this way. It\nalso seems certain that at least\none of the four bars run by\nCollege was actually losing money.\nAnother factor seems to be the\nprice paid for stocks. The accounts suggest that College\nbars were paying more for their\nstocks than UL U.UL U's bar,\nsince it is student controlled, is a member of a national student\nbuying consortium and as a result receives an extra discount\non its purchase.\nIt is also questionable whether\nCollege's policy of funding bar\ndevelopment, by obtaining money from the breweries in\nreturn for promises to buy their\nproducts, is really in the best\ninterests of the bars' customers.\nThe published bar accounts\njustify having serious doubts about the way in which College\nmanages the bars. These doubts\nwill only be allayed if the College\nmakes available far more detailed\ninformation, particularly trading\nfigures for individual bars.\nThere are only two good reasons for keeping this information secret: the inconvenience\nof compiling it and( more significantly) any inefficiency would be obvious. It is sheer\narrogance to claim that more\ndetailed accounts\" would be\nopen to misinterpretation by\npeople who would not under-stand the m\".I for one am perfectly capable of understanding them, and would welcome an opportunity to inspect them.\nThe Holland Club has shown\nthat it can run a bar far more\nefficiently than Mr Mooney. The\nUnion should have as its aim, securing control of at least one\nbar in Imperial, to be run for the\nbenefit of students. So long as\nthe present arrangements con-tin ue, we shall continue to have\nthe ridiculous situation where a successful Ents event makes a profit on admission charges of a few hundred pounds to be\nploughed back for students' benefit, while the College controlled bar nets well over a thousand pounds in extra profit.\nYours faithfully\nJP Stanley\nElec Eng4 See Editorial-Ed.\nSouthside Cafe\nDear Martin\nI was interested to read the\nletter last week complaining about the use of Southside Refectory by cement covered\nlabourers. This problem arose in\nthe summer and despite complaints by those of us working\non Southside little was done\nabout it except to ban them from\nhaving breakfast\u2014due to the\nfact that the income was badly\nneeded.\nHowever now term has begun\nand complaints have persisted I am pleased to inform the three\nfirst year chemists concerned\nthat Mr Mooney and Security\nhave agreed to the placing of a notice to the effect that unsuitably dressed persons will be\nasked to leave.\nIf anyone has cause for complaint please in form the\nSouthside Messenger who will\nask them to leave. If this system\nfails to correct this abuse I would like to be informed so\nthat a total ban on outside custom can be implemented.\nJohn McCallion Deputy President\nNo Sex Please\nDear FELIX\nI was hoping one letter would\nsuffice but since Nick Pyne resorted to personal abuse( albeit in a jovial manner) in his\nreply, I must make a number of\nfurther comments.\nNick has completely missed\nmy point, most of the material\nused in this pamphlet is true and\nI have no objection to (most of)\nthe material itself (most of it I would be quite prepared to tell\nmy children\u2014before people like\nNick do it!) and I entirely agree\nit is a major problem that sex\ncannot be talked about freely in society. But, apart from two\nsentences Nick has completely\nignored the psychological aspect\nof sex (indeed the books recommended did as well) which should be talked about but never\nis. Nick has only just touched on\nthe side effects problem of the\npill and not mentioned the VD in the mid-seventies (and still is\nas far as I know) reached epidemic proportions and cannot always be cured.\nApart from the above, Nick Pyne has missed an extremely\nimportant psychological point. It\nis almost impossible to speak out\n(partly because one is ridiculed\nas I demonstrated effectively\nwith last week's letter) especially\non sexual matters, and if it is\nseen that sex is universally accepted as an essential part of a student's life then there is a real\npossibility that someone that\ndoes not want to have sex may\nbe directly or indirectly forced\ninto it.\nThe implication in Nick's letter that\" when the time comes\" as Nick so quaintly puts\nit, I will require to know about\ncontraceptives and mast ur ba tion, partly correct. I will have to\nknow how best to avoid them.\nBelieve it or not, even in these\ntimes many couples feel they are\nbetter off without these methods.\nThe Catholic Church does inform its youth about sex (think\nwhere do Catholic children come\nfrom?).\nJust one last point, Iam in\nfact reasonably sane, Iam making a complaint, not leading\na crusade to convert IC! Yours sincerely\nMark Alderton\nEE Dear Martin\nIn the letters page last week\nMark Alderton complains that\nthe booklet ...but were afraid to\nask did not give a \"student's eye\nview of Imperial College\".\nI can commend to him, for\nthis purpose, the IC Union Alternative Prospectus, edited by\nme, and available free from the\nUnion Office.\nMoreover, I would suggest\nthat had Mark read the AP before coming to Imperial he\nmight have been less shocked, if\nnot less disgusted, at what he\nfound.\nDave Rowe\nChem2 DP's Bit\nWith regard to office hours I will\ngenerally be in my office from\n1:00 to 5:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays, from1:00 until2:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays\nand from3:30 to5:30 on Fridays. Now on to the business.\nDue to problems with money\nbeing stolen from the Gym changing rooms, anybody who wishes to leave valuables in the\nUnion Office safe at lunchtimes\nmay do so.

The Society receives its grant\nfrom the R CSU to provide informal lectures (not just to members of\nthe department but to all members of the Union) on subjects ranging\nfrom aspects of biochemistry to the virtues of real ale. R CSU officials\nhave complained that recent lectures have not been of general\ninterest, citing as examples lectures such as 'The UNC Operon and\nsynthesis of ATP in E coli nitro dion d ria and dil or ap lasts'.

At present,\npostgraduates can officially be\nexamined on any six of the\nsociety's lectures, although there\nis no written paper on them.\nAs a compromise, the department has offered to match the\nR CSU grant with an equal\namount of their own money, and,\nto use the combined funds to\nprovide more lectures of a high\nstandard. In anticipation, lectures have been arranged for\nnext term from two Nobelprize we inner s: Aaron Klug of\nCambridge and Professor Porter,\nthe head of Biochemistry at\nOxford.

Fol lo wing this IC dared to make their\nfirst attack on the Ashford goal\nand this ended with Hope confidently beating the keeper.\nIn the second half IC played\nmuch better, dealing adequately\nwith most Ashford attacks and\noccasionally showing some attacking ability. Five minutes\nfrom the end Purdy stormed in\nfrom the left wing to deflect as to rmer of a goal into the\nAshford net. This he promptly\nfollowed by trying to out-stare\nthe a foremen t nio ned ogre from\na distance of about six inches.\nUnfortunately battle did not\ncommence and Purdy lives to\nfight another day.\nOnce again Jones sparkled in\ngoal\u2014he was light years away\u2014\nmanaging to miss, sit on or catch\nthe ball every time it was hit at\nhim.

Shortly\nafter, a strong run by ' Bald y' Davis allowed Steve Thompson to touch down under the posts\u2014\nconverted by Steve Philips.\nAfter the interval( during which Warwick King combed\nhis hair three times) IC resumed\nthe attack and to everyone's surprise an IC penalty move\nactually resulted in a try by\nMark Pearse \u2014 converted by Steve Philips.

IC applied constant, if\nnot very enthusiastic pressure,\ndominating in almost all areas of\nthe game, resulting in a140 lead\nat half-time.\nThe second half saw an avalanche of scoring where personal scores were only proportional to greed. Highlight\nof the match was Steve Bell's dazzling try, showing that there's no substitute for sheer\nmass.\nThe final score of 54-0 is only\nan estimate as the referee admitted losing count. Try scorers were Downs(3), Boucher\n(3), Bell, Winsor, East land, Simmons; Winsor converting 7.\nSeconds\nIC vs Thames Poly\nSince there's not a great deal to\nsay about the disastrous so\nminute warm-up, readers will\nno doubt be more interested in IC's crushing defeat of Thames\nPoly in the bar afterwards.

'We\npoliticians are blind and backward looking' he said. As for the\ngenuine solution to un employ ment, his original topic, he said\nthat solving is not required, for it\nsolves itself.

His main\npoints were that private education undermines equality in\nsociety, damages industrial relations and is detrimental to\nstandards in public education.\nHe compared the much-vaunted\npoint of freedom of choice with\nthe freedom of choice in the\nUnited States to carry a gun.\nProfessor Raphael claims that\nsociety must weigh freedom\nagainst equality, and that a case\nhad only been made for imp rove ment s to the existing\nsystem, not for abolishing one\naspect of it.

Unfortunately, none of them can count\nabove 50, and so they have to use abaci.\nEqually unfortunately, they only have two\nabaci, both of which are broken, so that there\nare no longer 9 balls on all of the rungs.\nHaving counted up on these, they came to\nthe numbers 364 and 561. So how many pieces\nof music are there?\nAs a hint, the number depicted on the\nabacus shown, which shows 243, is actually 93\n(the fact that there are 4 balls on the bottom\nrung makes each ball on the next rung worth\n5; 6 balls on the second rung makes each ball\non the top rung worth 7 x5=35, so 243 on this\nabacus is equal to (2 x35)+(4x5)+3=93.

That the terms of reference of the Refectory Committee\nare \"to ensure the provision at economic rates of\nadequate catering facilities\".3. That the Refectory Committee consists of three members\nappointed, directly or indirectly, by the Governing\nBody, four members employed in College Block, and four\nmembers representing the Refectory Club membership\n(one staff, one non-academic staff, and two students).\nThere is also the Chairman of the Bar Committee that,\nat present, must also be a member of the Union Council.\nThe Chairman of the committee is one of those appointed\nby the Governing Body.\n4. That the Bar Committee is a Sub-Committee of the\nRefectory Committee with almost the same representation,\nthe main difference being the Chairman.\nThat despite the fact that these committees are\nresponsible for the refectories and bars, the only\naccounts they have been permitted to see are the overall totals and not the specific details of individual bars\nor refectories. That the Chairman of the Bar Committee (the ICU\nPresident this year) has seen these accounts, but has\nbeen sworn to secrecy.\nThat the main campaigner for more open accounts, the\nstaff representative Mr. R.A.

That the Union representatives on College Committees\nshould report to the Union any proposed changes that\neffect the Union and its members.\nICU Instructs:1. The Union Executive to actively campaign for the above\nbeliefs one to three inclusive.2. The Union Council to ensure that its nominees to College\nCommittees will represent the Unions beliefs, as\nexpressed above, to those Committees. Any represent-at ives that will not must be asked to stand down.\n3. That the Refectory Committee, the Rector, and the\nGoverning Body are to be informed that the changes made\nby the Refectory Committee to the terra s of reference\nproposed by the Bar Committee for itself are unacceptable\nto the Union.\n4.

The\naim of the Labour Party, said\nMr Orme, was to legislate in\nsuch a way as to allow for the\ndisclosure of detailed financial\ninformation so that workers\ncould start the process of\ncon cill i ation on the shop floor.\nThere would then be a trigger\nmechanism which would allow\neither management or workers\nto take these decision-making\nprocesses further, even to the\nmain board. Mr Orme was\ncritical of unions which refused\nto take part in these processes.\nIn his view some unions were\nafraid to make decisions that\neffected the lives of their\nmembers. Despite this Mr Orme\nfeels that the only channel for\nthe expression of workers views\nshould be through the trades\nunion movement.\nProfit sharing, said Mr Orme,\nwas not reasonable incentive for\nworkers to take part in the\nMiranda Bellchambers-an expert on Bo Photo by Katharine Alexander\ndecision making process, as\nmany parts of British industry,\nsuch as British Leyland, will\nstruggle to make a profit in a period of economic growth. The\nincentive should be the chance to\ndecide about their job, their\nwages, etc. Workers, he said\n\"want a good job, decent wages\nand to produce things that\npeople will want to buy.\"\nConsultation is, in Mr Orme's view, important as it allows for\nStanley Orme\nthe spreading of power from the\nfew hands in which it is concentrated. The top forty private\nfirms produce goods that make\nup thirty percent of the sales on\nthe British market. Some firms\nalready have the will to let'\nworkers make decisions but the\nlabour party, said Mr Orme,\nwould give all workers the\nability to start this process. How\nfar they take it is up to them.\nLocked In!\nStudents and computer operators in the Department of Computing\nwere asked to leave the Huxley Building last Wednesday by\nDepartmental Safety Officer Iain Stinson because many of the fire-exits-were chained up.\nThe recent problems began\nwhen College installed special\nelectric bolts to certain doors in\nthe Huxley Building. These bolts\nhold the doors locked, but are\nwired into the fire alarm circuitry\nand will be released if the alarm\nis triggered. However, because\nof initial installation problems\nthe bolts did not hold the doors\nshut properly, and so College\nSecurity officials were ordered to\nlock them at 7:00pm with chain\nand padlocks.\nThis caused an obvious fire\nhazard, and Mr Stinson regularly\nreported the matter to Bob\nFoggon, College Fire Officer,\nand Security agreed to leave the\ndoors unchained. Last Wednesday the doors were padlocked\nonce again and after fruitlessly\nasking the security guards to\n.unlock them, Mr Stinson asked\nthe computer operators to clear\nthe building.\nThe following morning Mr\nStinson resigned his position as\nSafety Officer until the matter\nIain Stinson\nwas cleared up. Manny Lehman,\nthe head of department, then\ninitiated a long discussion with\nMr Reeves and John Smith,\nCollege Secretary, as a result of\nwhich the new bolts have been\nproperly installed and Mr Stinson reinstated as Safety\nOfficer.\nSecurity are still padlocking\nthe door connecting the Huxley\nBuilding to the walkway, but as\nthis is not a Fire Exit no\nregulations are being contra-ve ned.

Unfortunately, Sheriff Ed Earl played by big\nbutch Burt Reynolds, who wants to protect the\nChicken Ranch so he can be sure of his weekly\nhandful of Miss Mona, is unused to handling\nthe media, and attempts to remove Melvin the\nway he might remove a stubborn mule, with\npredictable results: he hits the headlines.\nCertainly a film which has its moments, but\nsomehow falls between several stools. It never\n'gets its pants down' and becomes a fully\nfledged sexual romp, never be om ces farce,\nnever becomes really a musical (there are only\nnine numbers in a two hour film). There are\nsome good one liners and some clever Dolly Parton showing off her assets\ncaricatures of the state politicians, including an\nappear n ce by Robert Mandan (Mr Tate of\nSoap tame) who claims he must have been\ndrugged by com mies when he is f ou in d 'red\nhanded' in the brothel. However, Ed Earl and\nMiss Mona don't provide much of a central\nfocus for the film. The only two talents Dolly\nParton displayed were the ones you were\naware of as soon as she walks on, ana which\nthe wardrobe department (and the plastic\nsurgeons?) do nothing to conceal.\nSo if you like some good clean rib-tickling\nfun then pur d ner, you'd better mosey on down\nto the old Plaza in Leicester Square anytime\nyer hear?\nLee Paddon\nPhysical and\nPhilosophical!\nAgony\nHamlet by Shakespeare, directed by\nJonathan Miller at the Piccadilly Theatre.\nAfter a successful season at the Donmar\nWarehouse in August, Jonathan Miller's Hamlet is now at the Piccadilly Theatre. Another production of his, Verdi's Rigoletto, is\ncurrently being given to packed houses at the\nLondon Coliseum. Renaissance man Miller is\nas busy as ever, and despite various rumours,\nhe is not about to leave the stage for good.\nPremiering in January1983 will be his production of Mozart's The Magic Flute tor\nScottish Opera, and the following summer he\nwill be directing another Mozart opera at the\nOpera Theater at St Louis in the US. Hamlet centres around the popular Elizabethan theme of revenge. The talented\nAnton Lesser plays Hamlet and witnesses the\nghost of his father. The apparition informs him\nthat the man who married his mother so soon\nafter the funeral did in fact murder his father.\nShakespeare's great tragedy unfurls from here\nand exposes numerous issues in its stride.\nBecause of the play's richness in its language\nand ideas, these issues are open to a number\nof different interpretations, but one can be\nfairly sure that Shakespeare intended to\nexplore several points: the psychological\nexploration of Hamlet's relationships, the physical and philosophical agony of the hero\nunable to bring himself to carry out his task of\nrevenge, the tenuous dividing line between\nsanity and madness, and the influence of the\nsupernatural in man's dealings.\nUNION BAR\nBrakspear Nights\nBRAKSPEAR'S HENLEY\nSPECIAL\nii j j.'j'.11i_ i \u00ab \u2022 i_11 \u2022 i \u2022 11\niii iii iiii~ rrr crc iiii j.' jj||i rr ii~ ri~i~i J_ I_I_I iii iiii iiii iii iii iii ii|\"|\"||~I iii Mon 8 and Tucs 9 Nov.\n-so make a bee-line.\nPage 8\nAN ASTONISHING story has\nreached me concerning Jen Hardy Smith, the fri gh fully jolly\nUnion Administrator who has\nbeen in the Union long enough\nto be listed as one of its fixed\nassets. The title Union Administrator covers an astonishing\nvariety of jobs, all of which Jen\ncan be found doing (at the same\ntime) with her own forceful efficiency and good humour. But\njust occasionally the forcefulness\ntakes over with results which\nmight have been avoided with a bit more common sense, as is\nillustrated by the following:\nOne of the Union Administrator's functions is to act as a kind of Personal Assistant to the\nPresident \u2014 typing his letters,\nputting off unwelcome visitors,\norganising his diary, and so on. On the occasion in question Stephen had need to write a letter to someone or other concerning a student whose name had temporarily slipped\nhis mind. The scrawled longhand version which was presented to Jen thus began ' Dear Sir, I November 5, 1 9 8 2 MUH MH HI am writing to you concerning\n(Jen, please fill her name in here)\nabout etc' The letter was typed,\naddressed, and sent out, and it\nwas only a few days later that\nStephen (and presumably the\nrecipient) were amazed to read a letter beginning ' Dear Sir, Iam writing .to you concerning Miss\n( Jen, please fill her name in here)'!\nTHE PREVIOUS story (which\nwas told to me, of course, by\nStephen Goulder) was written\nup, typeset and ready for inclusion in FELIX when Maz Fellows, FELIX phototypesetter\nand the Editor's amanuensis,\nraised an interesting, if obvious,\nquestion. \" Surely,\" she asked,\n\" Stephen himself must have\nsigned the letter before it was\nsent out?\" She challenged him on this the next time he was in the office whereupon Stephen,\nwith the brusque cheerfulness he\nuses when he is hopelessly cornered, agreed that yes, of course he had signed the letter\nbefore it was sent out. With staff\nlike this is it any wonder IC Union has such a reputation?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 FELIX\n\n"
