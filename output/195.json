    "content": "10 FELIX Schroter reviews the Unions\nI feel very strongly that the constituent colleges unions are and\nshould be the cornerstone of the I.C. Union. At the beginning of\nevery year the same questions are raised, is the constituent college\nunion essential.and is it guiding student activity in the right direction?\nMany at I.C., both staff and students, argue that Union Officers are\ncomplacent and that our activities are childish and ever debasing.\nThose that level such criticism are not, in my experience, appreciative\nof the myriad of things done for them at Imperial nor prepared to take\nthe opportunity of truly widening their experiences of life.\nYOU AND YOUR UNION\nThe Union exists to provide\ncamaraderie amongst students and\nto offer social, recreational and\nsporting facilities which would\notherwise be far beyond the reach\nof its members. It must be realised that at no one time can the\nUnion cater for the interests of all\nits students but its opportunities\nare always1 open to those who\ngenuinely seek them.\nSPORTING COMPETITION\nESSENTIAL\nIrrthis picture the constituent\ncollege union plays a very import-ant, but, all too often, overlooked\nrole. The I.C. Union sets out a very broad network of general\ninterests which the college unions\ncomplement with societies such as\nthe Engineering Society, the\nMaths and Physical Society, and\nthe Motor Club; these societies\nare intended to broaden the outlook of the engineers or scientists\nbeyond the point where their academic courses leave them str an ded. Sporting competition is\nessential to the three colleges and\ndespite the apparent disparity in\nsize between Mines, R.C.S. and\nGuilds, keen enthusiasm and\nrivalry exists between us. That this\nspirit is carried over into the I.C. teams is well known. Surely in a, unit so large and impersonal as the\nUniversity of London intercollegiate rivalry in Imperial College\nis to be sought after.\nwe as students must prove our\ncompetence as mature thinking\npeople. I would be the last to decry \"sport\" genuine high-spirited-ness is very much an essential\npart of our enjoyment while at\nCollege and something which will\nalways be remembered. But, the\nline must be drawn between this\nand actions which cause acute\nembarrassment to the general\npublic and do nothing to promote\nthe good of Imperial College.\n. I trust that the collegiate\nsystem at Imperial will always\nbe the focus of our social life and\nthat the ever increasing numbers\nliving in residence will do their\nutmost to ensure this. I don't know of another college of university in England more packed\nwith capable people.\nIV.TUTORIALS\nfrom Another Correspondent\nTwo quite separate incidents\nlast week may give a clue to\nfuture education techniques. In\nthe Electrical department Professor Cherry has been experimenting\nwith closed circuit television as a visual aid to lecturing; he is already using with considerable\nsuccess two screens to show diagrams and small pieces of appa ra tus. Ultimately it is hoped to\nhave a complete closed circuit\nlink between all theatres and laboratories in the department. The\npossibilities are endless. Commented Professor Cherry, \" Students are now more familiar with\nT.V. screens than blackboards.\"\nThe second item, but separate\nfrom the above, is Cambridge\nT.V. week. During this last week\nCambridge devoted themselves to\nexperiments with television; this\ninvolved early morning lectures\nbroadcast to the public and the\nvarious aspects of T.V. in e duca tion. For one day a closed circuit\nlink was maintained with I.C. and\nduring this time a two way seminar was successfully held.\nIt seems that in the foreseeable\nfuture we may expect a permanent\nT.V. link with perhaps two or\nmore universities \u2014 eventually\neven with America. Lectures may\nbe illustrated by apparatus many\nmiles away, and lecturers will be\nable to perform without leaving\nthe warmth of their studies. A great new field has been entered\nand I.C. is up with the leaders.\nI LIKE SPORT\nIn recent years the autonomy of\nthe Union has been considerably\nreduced by administrative and\nacademic staff. They have held\nthe opinion that students are\nneither responsible enough nor\nsufficiently mature to manage\ntheir own affairs in all spheres.\nThis trend must cease and things\nmust return to the state where\nstudents capably control their\npresent and future. To this end\nPHOENIX\nNEEDS YOU\nAll budding bards\nshould bring their works\n403\nto\nCHE MENG at 1.00 p.m. on any\nMonday\nbefore 2nd December \u2014\nFILM SOCIETY\nJEAN COCTEAU AND SERGEI EISENSTEIN\n\" DEATH IS LIFE BACKWARDS\" This term you will have a chance to see the most important films\nof two men whose work to create a new art of the cinema has made\ntheir films classics.\nOn November 8th, at our next show, you can see \" ORPHEE \"\ndirected, produced, and designed by Jean Cocteau, who died earlier\nthis month aged 74. He worked with Diaghilev in Paris on numerous\nballets in his youth. Later he wrote and .produced plays and eventually made films. He was a poet from his earliest years\u2014\" poet\"\napplied in its wider interpretation as \" creator,\" not only in literary\nfields but in drama and dance like the early Greek poets.\n\" Orphee \" is one of Cocteau's distillation of poetry than any\ngreatest achievements in any\nfield. It contains a considerable\namount of autobiographical\nmaterial. All his life Cocteau\nwas obsessed by the love of death\n\" for death is only the reverse of\nlife.\" The story, of \" Orphee \"\nconcerns a poet's struggle between his love of Death (personified as a Princess) and his desire\nfor life (for his work and Eurydice, his wife). It is the key to\nCocteau's' attempt to explain the\nnature of man and poet and his\nbelief that life is only a short\nspace of time between one death\nand the next.\nFilm is particularly valuable\nmedium for Cocteau because his\nwriting is often difficult to translate with any fidelity and therefore must remain virtually unknown outside the French lan-gu age.\" Orphee \" contains a stronger\nother of his films. It is not slow\nlike his earlier films when he\ntried to \" prevent the images\nfrom flowing, to oppose them to\neach other to anchor them and\njoin them without destroying\ntheir relief.\" Cutting became a masterly instrument bringing out\nexcitement or tragedy with\nequal success. Here Cocteau's ideas were similar to those of\nSergei Eisenstein, who made film\n\" montage \"\u2014the contrasting of\nshots by editing\u2014a most important part of film-making.\nWe are showing Eisenstein's1; st and most important film on\nNovember 22nd. It is \" Ivan the\nTerrible, Part II,\" a fascinating\nstudy of the man who became the\nfirst Tsar of all Russia.\n(To join the Film Society see\nA. I. Hunter-Henderson, Falmouth 314, or Miss G.E. Oaklev. Beit Hall. 110.1\nbrainwash\nDr. W.W. Sargeant put us in\na trance with his talk on \" the\nMechanics of Brainwashing and\nConversion.\" He started by\nreading rather rapidly through\nhis notes to give us a general\nbackground to historic investigations ; the discovery by Pavlov\nthat shock could form protective\ninhibitions and inverted love-hate\nrelationships in his dogs; also his\nown experiences in the War with\nthe cure of battle neuroses. He\ndescribed how he could produce\nan ab reaction in the brain by\nstimulating the emotion of his\nsubject above the tolerance level\nwith physiological, psychological\nand biochemical stresses, so that\non collapse all the fixations, illusions and basic ideas had been\nremoved from the mind, leaving\nit susceptible to new suggestions.\nHe said that the same basic\nmethod for brainwashing and\nconversion had been and was\nused the world over. John Wesley, using the fear of hell fire on\nprisoners at Newdigate was able\nto produce dramatic conversions,\nwhich he believed was the \" doing of the Lord \"; and he cited\nHitler's production of mass hysteria, which carried away even\nthe most intelligent Germans. To\nprove his point, he showed us\nslides taken near and far : a picture on a Greek vase; natives\nand drums; poison snake handlers ; and pointed out the similarity in the facial expressions.\nThis was followed by a film of\nKenyan natives and their dances,\nslides of witches in England, and\na recording of a negro religious\nservice. After coffee, Dr. Sargeant answered questions for an\nhour and a half, questions ranging from police interrogation to\nleu co tomic s. Those of you who\nare aiming at a first, a colour, or\na good time, and would also like\nto gain a little education, would\ndo well to remember \" Monday\nNight is Wells Soc Night.\"\nCAUGHT IN PASSING\n\n"

    "content": "2 FELIX I am a greenhouse\nCameron\nDr. Cameron was disturbed by a statement, attributed to him,\nwhich appeared in the last issue of Felix. The relevant passage\nread :\u2014\n\" Dr; Cameron then went on to say that since so many students\ntake no part in Union or sporting activities, because of the organ is a tion'sun wield ly size, the only solution is to start a rival.\"\nWhen re-interviewed by Felix, he said :\u2014\n\" You see, I didn't want to convey the impression that I, as\nWarden of Tizard Hall, was going to make this Hall into a rival to\nthe Union. What I wished to draw people's attention to was that\nif some section of the Union were not doing its job properly, then\ncompetition would have a beneficial effect.\"\nBecause I am plugging the\nHall, it does not mean \" ip so facto,\" I am against the Union.\nThe impersonal is ation of the\nUnions is the main cause of any\nmalfunction ; also, I think many\npeople are deterred by the beer-drinking strongman image presented at Freshers Dinners and\nelsewhere. The idea of the buttery hour is to get the residents of\nthe Hall together. I hope that if\nthey leave Hall next year they\nwill come back to these gather-in gs, and will treat this Hall as\na second-time home.\nAt the moment, the staff are\nvery wary of becoming engaged\nin student politics. We see ourselves as holders of the ring. I personally see myself as a green-house, not planting but propagating that which grows within the\nHall! It seems to me that I.C. students are reactionary to\nchanges, even if they are for the\ncommon good !\"\nBrian King.\nMEWS RESIDENTS\nAIR THEIR VIEWS\nFrom page 1\nOne resident said that all he\nhad to show for a prolonged\nseries of such complaints was \"an\ninane letter from the domestic\nbursar who evidently did not care\nto bother himself with the\nmatter.\"\nA further claim made, was that\nthe college had violated an agreement dating back to the time of\nthe proposal for the building of\nSouthside. It was said that the\noriginal plans, and in fact, the\nplans held until recently by\nL.C.C., had reassured the Mews\nresidents that the Service Area\nwould be on the Prince's Gardens.\nside of the building. The real\nintentions of the college did not\nbecome apparent until the building was completed.\nNoise from the hostels was,\n(surprisingly), not generally considered excessive. Only about 30\nper cent, of those interviewed said\nthey were disturbed occasionally\nby drunken revelry at the closing\ntime of the Ennismore, but regarded it as not particularly\ntroublesome, and anyway in evi table.\nOne tenant was troubled by the\nintensity of the strip lighting on\nthe main staircase, another by\nchoir practices.\nThe residents sufficiently far\naway from the garbage to be able\nto smell Mooney cooking, described it as \" not really very\nnice.\"\nAll residents claimed to have\ngone through \" absolute hell\"\nduring the building of Southside:\nfalling bricks and articles of\nplumbing were apparently com-mon place. Broken windows,\ndented cars, ruined paintwork, all\nhad to be endured, in addition to\nthe noise and dirt.\nThe appearance of the building\nwas generally considered either\nfair or good, and certainly an\nimprovement on the bomb site\nthat existed previously. The fact\nthat it reflected sunlight into the\nMews was universally applauded.\nOne gentleman who rented a garage only, for working on his\ncars, thought that he really had\nno complaints about Southside\nwhatsoever, and added, \"actually\nI'm most grateful for it: if it\nwasn't for the bogs you've got\nthere I'd have to go right down\nto South Kensington.\"\nHUW DAVIS\nSmall Ads\nFOR SALE: 1935 MORRIS 8,\nrecently re-wired, new battery,\npassed M.O.T. test two weeks\nago, reconditioned engine in 1960,\ntaxed until January 1964. \u00a320 or\nnearest offer: Apply R.

These are things\nwhich affect all of us to a greater\nor lesser extent. Who is right in\nthem? What control has anyone\nover these events? How are they\ninter-related? Why? These are\nthe kind of topics we discuss, and\nthe kind of questions we ask and\ntry to answer in the Socialist\nSociety.\nAs scientists we produce the\nconcepts, the machines, and the\ntechnological ability to feed,\nclothe and shelter the world's population\u2014we could almost do\nit now. Yet even in an advanced\nindustrialized society like our\nown, we have not yet learnt how\nto put our highly sophisticated\nresources to use so that they\nbenefit everybody to the max-i mum. Often it is only the scientist\nwho comprehends fully the potency of what he is producing.\nScience influences basically the\nprogrammes a government puts\nforward, and these inevitably\naffect the scientist\u2014who decides\nabout research in Space? Or for\nArmaments? Or roads? This is\nwhy it is essential for us not to\nreject politics as being only for\nthe politicians.\nSocialism deals with the interrelations and practical control of\nthe motivating forces within so-cie ty. And science is one of the\nmost important of these forces\ntoday. This explains the Labour\nMEN OF OUR HALLS\nRt. Hon. Ronald Weeks (1890-1960) first distinguished himself\nin 1917 when he won the M.C. and Bar, and the D.S.O. After the\nwar he returned to Pilkingtons, and became a director in 1928. In\n1941 he was appointed Director-General of Equipment at the War\nOffice and in 1942 Deputy C.I.G. S. After the War he became chairman of Vickers and later sat on many other industrial boards, but\nhis outstanding contribution was in the field of technological education where he successfully raised \u00a3 3 | million for the advancement\nof scientific education in schools.\nMr. William Selkirk, the well-known mining engineer, who made\ngenerous benefactions to the college, and in particular to R.S. M. He founded scholarships and also set up the Hall of Residence which\ncarries his name. He was elected F.R.S. in 1949 and an Hon. Ass.\nof R.S. M. in 1956. Mr. Selkirk maintained an active and benevolent\ninterest in the students of the college, particularly those who embarked on the practice of mining engineering overseas.\nMr. Garden ( ) has no obituary.\nParty's emphatic demands for its\nproper control, and fairer sharing\nof the benefits ensuing. \" Signposts for the '60's\" points out\nthat 1 per cent of the nation's population owns nearly 50 per\ncent of the nation's. wealth! \u2014\nmostly amassed because of the\nsheer profitability of utilising\ntechnological innovation \u2014 from\nthe loom to the computer.\nSocialist Society supports Labour, but there is always much\nfree debate on Party policy, and\nall aspects of the Left. Open\nmeetings are specially intended to\ninterest those without deep know-ledge, while closed meetings\nalways contain much of esoteric\ninterest. This Thursday Ian\nMikardo is speaking in General\nStudies on \" Planning, Controls\nand Public Ownership,\" while\nother speakers this term discuss\nsuch topics as America's Colour\nProblem and Britain's need for\nmore and better housing.\nKeep an eye on the noticeboards for times and places.\nBRIAN HALL EARLY MORNING LECTURE Members of Physics 3 emphasising their eagerness to\nattend that early morning lecture at all costs\nA FRESHER'S IMPRESSION\nOF CAVING\nWearing an odd assortment of\n\" gro tty\" looking garb about 25\nbearded students, together with\nthe young ladies, gathered outside the I.C. Union in order to indulge in a week-end's caving in\nthe Mendips on the Fresher's Meet last Friday.\nMost of us squeezed into a battered van feeling like sardines in\na tin without the oil, and after\na stop at Reading we made our\nway to a four star barn which\ncontained straw, electric light\nand all the comforts of hard\nliving. Here we slept wakened\nonly by the arrival of other members of the club who came later\nby private transport.\nCaving for the first time is an\nexperience that is difficult to de-scribe, for after overcoming the\ninitial fear of crawling down a small hole in the ground that\nalready contains a stream, you\nare led through a world that you\nhad never before imagined\nexisted. It is filled with grotesque and beautiful formations\nof all colours and shapes that\nyou cannot stop to appreciate\nfully because the leader has\nmeanwhile disappeared round\nthe next corner saying, \"I 'll show\nyou something far more interest-ing.\"\nWe were led most competently\ndown ladder niches, along crawls,\nsqueezes, double pots, through\nvirgins' delights and other suggestive sounding places, no\nlonger caring how wet or cold\nwe may have felt because of the\nexhilarating feeling of adventure\nthat led us on to explore an unknown world.\nPerhaps the worst part of the\nweek-end was the following\nmorning when those of us who\nhad not the foresight to bring two\nchanges of clothes had to put on\nour wet things for another day's caving ; though once down again\nand moving this was forgotten\nduring a less strenuous day of\nexploring some smaller caves on\nthe East Mendips.\nThe week-end finished at 11.30\np.m. on Sunday when we arrived\nat I.C. feeling pleasantly tired\nafter what, for most of us, had\nbeen introduction to a fascinating\nnew pastime.\nS.G. DEXTER. MINORS\nCOLUMN\nThe first Union meeting of this\nterm was held on Tuesday, 15 th\nOctober. On the whole it was\nlively and, if we can rub out the\nchalk, it is to be hoped a good\nexample of better things to come.\nSpirit was high throughout the\nformalities and higher after reports of the healthy state of all\nclubs in Mines'. Two highlights\nof the meeting were the unanimous desire to swap RCS for the\nBedford College and the wish to\ninvite foreign miners Over for a weekend at the Union's expense.\nThis means tightening all belts,\nbut all voted this a worthy sacrifice. The volume of the chant\n\" Gimme an M\" and \" cats \"\ndemonstrated the overall fitness\nof Minesmen.\nThis year Mines is big enough\nto hold three fresher's dinners and\nthe first of these, for metallurgists,\nwas held on 18th October. It was\ncompletely successful even to the\nsoaking of a few insolent Guildsmen. It must be reported that\nall our guests and most fresher s had a good try at drinking the\nyard. All events so far and the\npromise of more and better things\nto come look like the start of1 an Al year for Mines.\nTHE FUGUE AS A DIALOGUE\nMr. Alec Robertson equalled\nthe standard he set in his first\ntalk in his second on the fugue,\ngiven last week. In the first he\nexplained how meaning and atmosphere in music are conveyed\nby rhythm and melody. This\ntheme was amplified in his next\ntalk, in which he likened the good\nfugue to an orderly discussion in\nwhich all the speakers shared\ntheir topic without competing.\nThe approach to the fugue in\nearly Church music was illustrated by a piece for voice and\ninstruments written as a tribute\nto the Duke of Fenara by the\nFlemish Josquin Deprez in the\n16th century. Mozart could play\nfugues on the piano \" out of his\nhead \" and one of the results was\nthe G major String Quartet,\nwhich was also heard. Mr.\nRobertson also played an extract\nfrom Verdi's Requiem and some\nBartok. He said that the third\ntalk would be devoted to Britten's\" War Requiem.\"\nChris Cooper,\n\n"

Meanwhile on the banks of\nthe Thames, a large number of Guildsmen will engage in moral combat with a similar quantity of R.C.S.

In answer to\na question about the bare concrete finish, he said that it was deceitful\nto conceal the basic construction ; also it is reassuring to see what\nis holding the building up. When Dr. Cameron asked if he would\nlike his own house to be finished in bare brick he replied that his\nbathroom was the only room that was plastered. It was pointed out\nthat the board concrete finish is just as expensive as a plaster finish\nbecause better quality concrete had to be used. The little holes that\nare scattered so profusely around the walls are not ash trays as many\npeople supposed, but are for decorative purposes.\nThe L.C.C. Means of Escape leg e wanted students to do most\ncommittee refused to allow wood\nshuttering in the entrance halls as\nthis was an additional fire risk,\nhence the asbestos notice boards.\nThey insisted on the balconies\naround the gallery floor as an\nadditional fire precaution. These\nbalconies have an annoying habit\nof reflecting any intimate conversations straight down to the residents of the mews, so beware!\nThe size of the galleys was\ncriticized but apparently the col-of their cooking in their rooms.\nSince then they have obviously\nchanged their views and have forbidden students to cook in their\nrooms, but have forgotten to increase the size of the galleys.\nEverybody approved of the\ncolour schemes throughout the\nhalls except one student who has\na blue counterpane, a green car-pet, a grey chair and a fawn\ncurtain.\nA. J. OXLEY r COMMENT\nIr COUNTER-COMMENT\nThere are, many Iraqui students in this country, including a number at this college. It seems\nthat some of them have had their\ngrants cut or stopped, not because of academic reasons but because they or their parents are\nalleged to hold political views\ndiffering from those of the Iraqui\ngovernment. It is difficult to\nfind out any more details as the\nstudents (possibly not wishing to\ndraw reprisals) are unwilling to\ndiscuss the matter. If individual\nBritish students \u2022 at this college\nwent to the Embassy in Queens\nGate and asked to see the Cultural Attache, some light might\nbe shed on the whole affair.\nIn a Felix report of Princess\nMargaret's visit, \u00a34,000 was said\nto have been the cost. This\nmoney was presumably spent for\nthe benefit of the college, since\nH.R.H. cannot have gained much\nfrom the experience. None of\nthe occupants of South Side, or\nmembers of the college that I have spoken to seem to feel\nbetter for the money spent on\ntheir behalf, and one fears ultimately at their expense ; the Rector doesn't look very happy in\nthe photo either.\nIt is said that Nigel Gravette\nis making plans for \" dealing\nwith the blok e who sells the\nDaily Worker outside the Union.\"\nMr. Gravette is perfectly at\nliberty not to buy the pao er; it\nseems impertinent to take it upon\nhimself to protect the rest of the\nunion from the Daily Worker\nsellers' pernicious influence. It\nis certainly not the business of\nthe President of R.S. M. to J nter fer e with someone not on union\npremises, and if Mr. Gravette\nfancies himself as a defender of\nthe Free World, he should not try\nto limit the freedom of a political\nopponent to express his views!\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nEXPLORATION BOARD\nExpeditions, Summer 1964\nIn recent years requests to the\nExploration Board for grants to\nsupport expeditions have been\noutstripping the available funds.\nThis session the Board proposes\nto support fewer enterprises than\nin recent years.\nTo save organisers of expeditions unnecessary work in preparing proposals in great detail, when\nthere may be no chance of their\nobtaining support, a meeting will\nbe held in the middle of November to discuss preliminary proposals for expeditions. These should\nbe submitted as soon as possible\nto the \u2022 Boards's Secretary (Mr.\nP.F. Taylor, Department of\nCivil Engineering) and except for\nthe financial estimates need not\nbe in great detail.\nA further meeting of the Board\nwill be held before the end of the\nterm to allocate grants where\nappropriate.\nby B.J. Bull and P. Airey\nI know that Mr. Fuchs is regarded with not a little humour in\nthe College and that some of us\ntend automatically to laugh at\nthe views he expresses. This week\nhowever, I find myself in the\nhappy position of being in agreement with him. Perhaps this is\nbecause his comments are not\ncontroversial. Nobody I am sure,\nwill disagree that the Iraqui\nStudents are getting a raw deal,\nif the rumours Mr. Fuchs mentions are true. He ought how-ever, to have quoted his sources\nof information before trying to\nthrow the might of I.C. against\nthe Iraqui embassy. With a bit\nmore concrete evidence, Mr.\nFuchs would find me, and I hope,\nthe rest of I.C., on his side.\nIt is amusing to read the words\nfreedom in connection with the\nDaily Worker. Two or three years\nago, the then Editor of that paper\n(now in the salt mines?) gave a short talk on Britain under Communist rule at the end of which\nwere the inevitable questions. One\nperson (stooge?) asked if the freedom of the press would be\nmaintained\u2014the reply was as fol-lows: \u2014 \" Yes, the freedom of\nthe press was guaranteed; we\nwould not suppress any paper\nunless necessary \" . . . Clapping\nfrom front row (more stooges?).\nIt is time those pseudo Communists who support the Party\nrealised what they are helping to\nbuild . . . It will not be enough to\nsay \" We did not realise \" . . .\n(as Mr. Nehru of India).

    "content": "6 FELIX EDITORIAL\nMORPHY PAST\nTraditionally a boat race, but more recently an excitable uncontrollable rabble causing inconvenience and often distress . . . two old\nladies in a car terrorized, another knocked down . . . a small boy's balloons deliberately burst, barriers smashed, traffic delayed, cars\ntun ned round; these are pages in the history of Morphy Day. In an\ninterview with a prominent member of the Guilds Union the terms\nmob rule and sadism appeared before a more satisfactory explanation\nwas put forward. What is the motive force behind Morphy Day?\nOstensibly it is to watch the boat race; it starts off as an innocent brawl\non the tow path, the boats pass, but interest is remote; few even\nrecognize their own crew. Then comes the dangerous process of\nreleasing the tension that has been fanned and inflamed for weeks in\nadvance; it is here that the principles of \" safety in numbers\" and\n\" mob rule \" emerge. Taking refuge in the unruly horde, students set\nabout causing as much damage and inconvenience as they can safely\nget away with. On the way back from Putney the game of cop and\npublic baiting is used to pass the hours till tea.\nMORPHY .PRESENT\nIt is difficult to see what the real purpose'behind all this so called\nsport can be. After much discussion with the Guild's Vice President\nthe reason was finally put forward as \" an occasion to induce and\nmaintain a strong cohesive College spirit.\" More recently the two\nPresidents (RCS and Guilds) had clearer ideas. While strongly deploring the irresponsible nature of this misdirected nuisance value to the\npublic, Bob Schroter opined that the boat race and support thereof\nshould be the motive; \" Guilds will be easily recognizable this year \"\nhe said; a step in the right,direction. Chris Tye, no oarsman, more\nrealistically decided that the race has for a long time been little more\nthan an excuse, but that the energies of the students must be more\nstrictly controlled.\nMORPHY FUTURE\nIt seems that the era of beer drinking college executives is passing,\nand that rather deeper thought is going into the planning of such\noccasions. Unlike the Carnival Rags where publicity is the aim,\nMorphy Day has no such end in view; any publicity it has obtained in\nthe past two years can only have been for the College, and unfavourable at that. It is time that this uninhibited unpleasantness was taken\nin hand\u2014it seems that this year's executives have recognized the\nproblem; it remains to be seen where they will tea d^ and whether the\nstudents will follow.\nFELIX NEWSPAPER\nOF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCirculation, 1700\nEditor: J.

In fact, the Registrar informs me that total number\nof applications for admission to this College was little different from\nlast year and the number of places which finally remained vacant\nwas, as usual, a very small fraction. What was surprising was the\nshortage of candidates during the clearing-up process which takes\nplace during September, when this year it has been more difficult to\nfill last-minute vacancies.\nANTHONY CAMP LING Southside Seeker\nHALLS,\nLIKE FELIX,\nSWINDLED\n\" I 've got a bird keeping me\nsupplied with drinks\"\u2014was it you\nwho said that?

We\nhave had a reasonably stable team during the past few seasons, but\nthis year we find Ourselves rebuilding. The opening match of the\nseason saw a~ first team containing no fewer than five newcomers\nto college football. Since this is played with considerably more dash\nand speed than average school football, it is not surprising that the\nteam is taking some time to settle down.\nSuccessive defeats at the hands\nof Winchester, Q.M. C. and Reading University have emphasised\nthis. From now on, however, we\nshould be able to form some kind\nof idea of how much success we\ncan expect this season. To repeat\nlast year's good effort is not\nbeyond us so long as all our players do their utmost to ensure\nstable teams.\nOn the social side, Chris Hornblower has been elected Social\nSecretary and promises to be\nquite active, having organised the\nexcellent \" Pie and Mash \" supper for the fresher s. RUGBY\nRESERVE STRENGTH SHOWS\nHOCKEY\nDuring their match against Merton on 12th October, the 1st XI\nHockey team were reduced to\nnine men. Captain Kerry Peters\nreceived a badly bruised hand and\ngoalkeeper Ted Needham had to\nhave 11 stitches in his lip.\nATHLETICS\nAthletic Club Trials have been\nre dated to prevent a clash with\nMorphy Day. They will now be\nheld at Hurlingham track next\nWednesday, 6th November. The\nWinter Championships themselves are on the following Wednesday (13th November).\nBOXING\nThe I.C. BOXING CLUB is\nre-forming this year. Active members are needed at all weights,\nespecially in the heavyweight\ndivision. All enquiries to Mike\nNeville-Polley via the Union rack.\nCYCLING\nAlthough l.C. itself has no\ncycling club, due to lack of sup-port, both the captain Colin Cross\nand the secretary Steve Colgan of\nthe University club are I.C. men.\nIf you are interested in cycling,\neither touring or racing, contact\none of them through the Union\nrack.\nJUDO\nAfter several years of ne got i a tion, the college judo club hope\nsoon to be the proud owners of a real Japanese mat. Cost: about\n\u00a3200. This will probably be used\nin the gym on Tuesday evenings.\nA slightly altered 1st XV scored two wins in succession last\nweek against \" F\" division (12-5)\nand Sutton Swallows (15-3). Team\nchanges followed our defeat by\nReading University the previous\nWednesday when few people enhanced their reputations and the\nless said about that the better.\nRain spoilt the game against\n\" F\" division as far as the backs\nwere concerned, but enough was\nseen of them to appreciate the\ngreat potential there.\nSUPERIOR FITNESS\nThere are few real \" stars \" in\nthe side though perhaps this is a good thing. Team work and an\nenthusiastic spirit often pay bigger dividends, especially when\nsupported by constant practice\nand training. It was pleasing to\nsee our superior fitness show up\nagainst Sutton when we scored 12\npoints in the last 20 minutes.\nSeveral fresher s are regularly\nimpressing and knocking on the\n1st XV door; G. Rogerson, B. Elliot, N. Bentley and R. Potts\nto mention the best. The team\nseems to be settling down now,\nJUDO\nBEST IN\nENGLAND?\nOff to a flying start this season,\nthe Judo club have already beaten\nKings 4-1 and face their match\nagainst Oxford and Cambridge\nwith confidence {result in stop\npress).\nLC. fielded two teams against\nKings at the Fulham Road pad\nwhich is regarded as our competitive home ground. Some of the\nclub's new members were seen in\naction for the first time. The\nresult shows that they did not\ndisappoint us. Teams were: (1)\nP. Prescott, D. Henton, P. Hall,\nR. Jackson. (2) P. Prescott, M. Kay, R. Done, R. Huff.\nA friendly, staged afterwards\nwith changed teams, was won 3-1\nby Kings.\nOur Judo Club is now reckoned\nto have one of the strongest college teams in England. Training\nconditions are superb. The authorities granted permission to use\nthe building adjacent to South\nSide car park for this purpose and\na mat is permanently laid out\nthere.\nBeginners' instruction, by the\nhigher graded members of the club\ntakes place Thursday evenings.\nAll interested members of the college are urged to join the club\nsince it is hoped to turn out two\nteams regularly this year and their\nstrength will depend directly on\nthe standard maintained in the\nclub.\nthanks mainly to the strength of\nthe feeder XV's. For every fresher in, one old lag\nmust go out and it is hard train-ing, not past reputations, which\nwill retain places this year..\nEVERY fortnight, in addition\nto the 1st XV progress report, we\nintend to include a paragraph on\none of the other XV's. This week\nwe start with the BI's. Two matches played\u2014two won\n(of course) by 20-0 and 11-3.\nThese convincing victories have\nbeen made in spite of a serious\nfitness problem in the team. After\nan ugly rumour that a certain\ncentre had been seen training, he\nwas \" dropped\" to the Ex-l st XV. The quantity of beer consumed has been well up to our\ncustomary level and the singing\n(also the match points) has been\nimproved by the presence of that\nwell-known Welsh referee W.( Bill) Jenkins (tenor?). Diplomatic relations have also been\nset up with the 1st XV.\nBl XV Record to date:\nP.2,W.2, F.31,A.3.

Relay, held on Sat.\n12th Oct., was the first opportunity for the U.L. clubs to meet\nand size each other up. U.C. put\nin three teams, giving everyone a chance to run. Joe Fitzsimmons\nprovided the best time for the\n1.8 mile lap, doing it in 9min.9 sec. In the overall placing the\n1st team came 14th, the 2nd23 rd and the 3rd35 th. On Wednesday, 16th Oct., we\nmet King's on our home course\nat Petersham and defeated them\nfair and square. Both clubs ran\nthree teams of six and each I.C. team beat its King's counterpart.\nThis success was due mainly to\nthe commendable efforts of the\nrunners in the middle portion of\nthe club.\nThe 2nd U.L. trial was held at\nParliament Hill Fields on Saturday, 19th Oct.

Your\nown paper might be better were\nit printed with greater care and\nwere the countless irritating mistakes rectified; even so it is on\nthe whole dull.\nBut what of Phoenix; it appears\nirregularly, costs the Union a great deal of money and has very\nlittle to recommend it. Only the\nlayout and in the past the cover\ndesigns (these too alas have gone),\nwere interesting. The poetry is\ncrude and astonishingly artificial\nwhile the prose suffers from the\nsame faults; few of the things in it\ndeserve to be in print, even in\nPhoenix. The literary standard\nis so low that I can see no excuse\nfor its continued publication.\nYours,\nPseudo.\nWhy not do something about it?\n\u2014Ed.\nDear Sir,\nMay we appeal through your\ncolumns to the mass of non-fanatical students to contribute their\nshare to Imperial College spirit.\nVery shortly many societies\nand clubs will be starting competitions against other colleges\nfor University trophies, e.g., de-bating, football, hockey and\nrugby, and the presence of a large number of \" supporters \"\n(even though the technicalities\nmay baffle them) adds enormous\nincentive to the people who take\npart and spend hours of their\ntime practising and preparing.\nAll events are well published\nand, in the case of clubs, free\ncoaches take people to and-from\nthe grounds.

Dear Sir,\nStrange Happenings in South\nSide ?\nIn view of the new regulations\npublished recently with regard to\ndiscipline, we should like to know\nfor what nefarious purpose one\nof the esteemed wardens of a South Side Hall was wandering\naround Princes Gardens at dead\nof night weald inga large brown\nmattress ? Later on a blue bedstead was found draped over the\nnewly-planted magnolia tree,\ncausing much inconvenience to\nthe only dog resident!\nYours, etc.,\nResidents of South Side.'\nDear Sir,\nAs the annual turnover in\nmembers of the Union is about\none-third, no issue can be deemed\nclosed as you have recently suggested (\"Felix,\" 194, 16th Oct.\n1963), and certainly not that of\nthe election of the President. If\na decision against the election of\nthe President by the individual\nmembers of the Union was taken\nthree years ago, then few remain\ntoday who had anything to do\nwith that decision.\nFurther, I fail to see what is\nwrong with \" the popular hero\nbeing swept into power;\" it is,\nafter all, the goal that most\nwould-be civilised communities\nhave been aiming at for at least\ntwo centuries. Most other student\nunions in the country manage\ntheir affairs at least as well as we\ndo, even though operating under\nsuch a crushing burden.\nYou write \"it seems fit that\nCouncil, who appreciate the\nduties and responsibilities of a President rather more clearly than\nthe average student (sic), should\nelect him \" and then in your editorial refer to \" those in the positions of highest authority that turn\nup night after night in an advanced state of inebriation \": if\nthese statements .come from one\nand the same person, like H.G. Wells, I find myself \"at South\nKensington, lost and dismayed at\nthe multitudinous in consecutive ness of everything.\"\nNo, sir, there is no justification\nfor the present method of choosing our President which counts\nhalf as much as the principle of\naccepting the responsibility of the\naverage student. If it could be\nshown that our Presidents, in the\nyear prior to their office, are\nschooled to take over the administration, then I could see some\nsense in the method, but this\ncertainly did not happen for the\npast two Presidents at least.\nAgain, I would concede some\nvalidity in the system if the men\nit threw up were exceptionally\nable Presidents, leaving behind\nthem a Union more vigorous,\nmore relevant and with substantially more people participating in\nits affairs than when they took\nover; need I say more on this?\nIt would be fatuous to imply\nthat popularly elected Presidents\nwould be giants amongst men, but\nthat they would carry out their\nduties as well as those elected by\nthe present method cannot be\nrefuted. Your editorial mentions\nthe declining power of the President and the Union vis-a vis the\nCollege authorities, and yet you\nfail to see that a President elected\nby the whole student body would\nbe endowed with far more significance. At the moment, who can\nthe President claim to represent?\nFinally, any President, however\nselected, must have the Executive\nbehind him, must plead his case\nin Council whose decisions have\nto be ratified by a Union General\nMeeting, before he can achieve\nanything. If any stupid decision\ncan get through this series of\nchecks, it can do so now.\nA student of 21 years plus is\nconsidered fit to take part in the\nelection of an M.P., yet you\nwould deny him an equivalent\nright within Imperial College\nUnion. Does Dave Watson really\nfeel he is more validly the President because he was elected by\nCouncil rather than such obviously unworthy characters as you\nand I, sir?\nYours faithfully,\nLES MASSEY.\n2134 Homecrest Avenue (C8), Brooklyn 29, New York.\nSeptember 3, 1963.\nSir Patrick Linstead, Rector\nImperial College of Science &\nTechnology,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon, S.W.I.

This year\n, \u00ab ..-'. .\u2022 the traditional ceremony of presentation of Associates, Diplomas and\nFellowships had special significance in that the visiting speaker was\nLord Robbins whose report on Higher Education had been published\nthe previous day. After the colourful display of hats and gowns had\nbeen followed by thin excerpts from Prince Igor by the choir, the\nRector presented his report. He spoke briefly on the achievements\nof the College over the past year emphasising two points : firstly, the\nrecruitment of outstanding men to the staff at a time when the\nemigration of scientists was prevalent, and secondly the great need\nto recruit more wor a$n students. \"We are a mixed College,\" said\nthe Rector, and pointed out that under him the female population\nof the College had trebled since 1955. Every encouragement should\nbe given to double the present figure as soon as possible.\nROBBINS EVADES THE\nISSUE\nLord Robbins killed all speculation about his visit with his\nopening words, where he made it\nclear that he had no intention of\nspeaking on higher education.\nHe apologised to the Chairman\nfor being present under false pre-ten ces.

Whether the much-mentioned\nwidening of academic horizons\nmeans that further courses will\nbe added, and whether I.C. will\neventually achieve University\nstatus remains to be seen.

SOUTHSIDE SERVICE AREA\n\"MEDIAEVAL SLUM\"\nResidents of Princes Gate Mews, at the rear of Southside, who\nwere interviewed by our reporters, complained that despite \u00a3120 per\nyear rates, they had an outlook little better than a slum. The principal cause of discontent was the refuse disposal area which was said\nto \" smell like a pig ger y\" and to \" rival an African village in its\nprimitive ness,\" The hostels' garbage, overflowing from inadequate\ncontainers, was kept in a repository which was seldom, if ever, shut\noff from the street and the resulting atmosphere was so obnoxious\nas to endanger their health and existence. It was also said that of\nthe constant stream of tradesmen's vehicles that delivered to the back\nof the hostel, many were driven down the Mews at such a maniacal\nrate as to make the residents fear for their lives.\nThe College and Hostel authorities were accused of ignoring\ncomplaints, or of \" passing the buck from one to another.\"\nCont on page 2, Column 3\nINDEX Reader's Letters 4\nDepartmental News 7\nEditorial 6\nSport 12\nArt Review 3\nCouncil Report 7\nComment and\nCounter-Comment 9\nMines Column 11\n\n"

SA . are staging a truly remarkable exhibition at the R.CA.( behind I.C. Union). Called \" The\nVisual Aspects of Science,\" it\nremains open until 2nd November\n(admission free).\nNot Only do the exhibits show a beauty of line and form, but they\nare instructive to all levels of the\nintellectual scale. The underlying\ntheme of the show is living cells\u2014\ntheir structure and function. Particularly clear models, photographs and diagrams of cell contents and biochemical reactions\nare on view, accompanied by a12 minute film of the monster model\ncell that you may have seen on\nT.V. a while back. The centre-piece is a huge \" model brain \"\nwhich in a simple manner demonstrates the complicated workings\nof that organ (the unit that works\nthis is quite impressive too when\none considers that everyone of us\nhas something of this nature in\nour own head).\nIn short, a thoroughly good\nshow (with a free booklet on how\nthe brain works) which no member of I.C. should miss.\nPROF. HALSEY Professor A.H. Halsey, eminent sociologist and broadcaster,\nhas lectured at several American\nuniversities including Harvard\nand Chicago. He is now Head of\nthe Department of Social and\nAdministrative Studies at Oxford\nand a Fellow of Nuffield College.\nIn his first of a series of five\nGeneral Studies lectures, Professor Halsey contrasted pre- and\npost-industrial society, illustrating\nthe change in attitude from class\nconflict to strife between the old\nand the young.\nIn his second lecture, having\ncondensed Marxist Theory into\none sentence (!) Professor Halsey\nshowed how the five fundamental\nMarxist prophecies are not ful-filled. He finished by saying that\nMarx is, nevertheless, the sociologist from whom most can be\nlearnt about the development of\nsocieties today.\nQuestions connected with the\nlectures should be sent to Professor Halsey either at Nuffield\nCollege or through the Touchstone secretary.\nA.R. CAMPLING.\nGARDEN OF EDEN Wives- drink tea and plant tree\nBy a Staff Reporter\n29th October, 1963\n\" I'm only waiting for it to\nrain,\" said the Domestic Bursar,\nas Lady Falmouth planted a commemorative magnolia tree\noutside Falmouth Hall. Certainly it was dull, and a little\ncool, but the ladies of the \" Wives\nTea Club \" were there in force.\nEarlier, in the relative warmth\nof the staff lounge in Southside,\nthe Rector told the ladies a little\nabout Lord Falmouth's efforts\nfor the college, and Lady Falmouth, in her reply, said how\nmuch her late husband loved I.C. After the ceremonial planting,\n2-year old Louise Weale, daughter of Warden Weale and his wife\nCarol, presented a bouquet of red\nroses to Lady Falmouth.\nAt an exclusive interview with\nFelix Lady Falmouth had this to\nsay : \" It's all very interesting,\nand the recreation rooms are so\ngood ; also they do need using,\ndon't they ? \" and added, \" for\nmyself, I'm old fashioned, and\ndon't like the modern design, although its very good of its kind.\"\nAltogether it was a great success, although one horticultural\nwas heard to say, \" wrong time\nof the year for transplanting, it\nwon't grow.\"\nIncidentally, should the magnolia survive 18 British winters\nit should flower.\nDEB AT IN GS\nOG REVIVAL? from our own Correspondent.\nAfter three weeks of caretaker\nGovernment, the debating society\nhas a new committee. A mere\n57 students were present when\nGordon Hall, formerly of Cardiff\nUniversity, was elected President.\nIn a straight fight with Communist\nsym pathis^ t,' Frank Foulkes, Hall\npolled a large majority. The exact\nfigures, however, were not dis-closed. Union President Dave\nWatson and thwarted Foulkes are\namong those who will form the\nnew committee.\nHall, a garrulous Welshman if\never there was one, quickly called\nhis first commit ee meeting. Later\nhe said \" we want this society to\nbe 'a ken seriously. It should bp\nthe voice of the union.\" Among\nhis proposals are evening debates.\n''This will allow more time for\nspeakers on the floor \" Hall said.\nHe then suggested that the garbled\nand hurried lunch time debates\nof the past had contributed to the\ndisruption of the Society.\nFinal word from Union President Watson: \"It's about time\nthis thing was put on its feet again\nand Gordon Hall is quite capable\nof doing just that.\"\nEIGHT PICTURES ON LOAN\nTO IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nAbstract paintings are admirably often able to command one's enthusiasm, seldom dismissal. The\nnew student hostel at Princes\nGardens has eight abstract paintings on loan. In the lower stu-dents' common room Frank\nAvray-Wilson's large almost monochromatic painting of both vital\nand interesting organic forms; very\nwell suited to the position rit enhances the room. Two other\npaintings by the same artist are in\nthe upper students common room\nand snack-bar. The first a smaller\nblue painting explores the two\ndimensional canvas with great\ncharm. The second is near the\nsnack-bar counter painted with\nreds and sienna s; a feast of colour\nand paint drawn with care, purpose and dramatic statement.\nEntirely different, is Brian\nFielding's painting in the students\ndining room. This large decorative painting has colour which,\napplied in natural elegant shapes\nis economically balanced. The\nappeal of this picture is' enormous\nand requires the larger area of the\ndining room for viewing. Another\npainting by the sam '\"\\ just\ninside the entrance, near the stairway to the upper students common room. It does not, unhappily,\nsuit its cold concrete wall sur-rounding s. The painting has\nbroad curves, painted in thin\nblue-green, leaving a lot of the\ncanvas white. In the upper students common room Brian Farmer's small, forceful and simple\npainting is more plastic in approach than the other paintings\nreviewed so far. His shapes are\nsimple having little organic move-ment, but are powerful none the\nless. Another painting in the east\nstaff common room by the same\nartist in the idiom of the last\npainting spoken of, uses a simple\nplastic shape in charcoal black.\nHaving no texture, the paint is\nevenly applied in tight, isolated\nareas. These paintings are particularly suited to the interior\ndesign.\nThe new student hostel at\nPrinces Gardens is well worth a visit to see these interesting pictures by four of our younger\npromising artists. The architects\nare to be congratulated on their\nforesight in asking the Redfern,\nZwemmer and A. LA. galleries to\nloan one or two pictures. It would\nbe a good idea to give artists\nthe opportunity to show here\nand give the students the chance\nto recognize the artists of today.\nThere are at present two shows of\nour foremost abstract painters in\nLondon.- Rodrigo Moynihan and\nDonald Hamilton-Frazer are both\ndistinguished artists. Would it be\npossible to see some of their work\nin the new building?\nCONNIE FENN.\nA South side picture.\nWhich way up?\nConnie Fenn is a private artist,\nand ex-scholar of the Royal College of art. She is tutor to the I.C. art club.\nTHE DEBATING SOCIETY is on its feet\nWATCH THE BOARD\nFOR DETAILS\n\n"

    "content": "8 FELIX 'BY TYE\nMY HOLIDAY JAUNT\nby Chris Tye, President of R.C.S. Although I am a native of\nDevon it was with little enthusiasm that I recently paid an involuntary return visit.\nBy luring me into the room of\nthe vice-president of Guilds,\nunder the pretext of discussing\nMorphy Day, ten brawny and ill-mannered Guildsmen captured\nme.\nI was kept in Falmouth Hall for\nseven hours, during which R.C.S. decided that whilst I could look\nafter myself \" Theta\" needed\nlooking after with the tender and\nloving care to which he/she/it is\naccustomed.\nI was tied up and having been\nclothed and fed they carried me\nto a waiting car and wedged in\nthe back seat. I had no idea of\nthe intended destination of the\nvehicle, but as the distance from\nLondon increased I became more\nannoyed \" surely they can't be\nstupid enough to take me further\nthan Salisbury Plain,\" I thought,\nbut being engineers they were and\nthey did. On the way I was fed\nagain and at about 11 o 'clock I was released about twenty miles\nfrom Exeter in the middle of\nDartmoor.\nA car soon came along, and\nstopped. A torch shone in my\nface\u2014it was the cops. They asked\nwhat I was doing. \" I'm going to\nLondon,\" I replied, and explained\nthe circumstances. They took\npity on me and gave me a lift,\nmentioning that they were out\nlooking for two escaped convicts\nfrom Princeton Jail, who were on\nthe run.\nAll too soon our ways parted,\nand I found myself alone again.\nAnother lift for four miles or so,\nand then on by foot. Whilst I trudged on, I thought of all those\nold jokes about stranded commercial travellers knocking at\nlonely farmhouses and bedding\nthe farmer's daughter. How I longed for the farmhouse and the\ndaughter.\nA few more lifts and by four\no 'clock I was 9 miles from Ilminster. I used to have a girl friend\nthere and I was inspired to walk\non. By 7 o 'clock I was two miles\nfrom Ilminster and completely\nshattered. But soon I got a lift\nto Camberly on a truck, and from\nthere three trips got me to Queens\nGate by 1.35 p.m. on Wednesday.\nAnd so to bed, but not for long,\nthere was a Fresher's Dinner in\nthe evening. Schroter had the\ncourage to be a guest at the dinner but, for some reason didn't appear in the bar afterwards..\nWell, what was the result of the\naffair? For me, it was a loss of\ntwo days work and a night's sleep and the gain of many blis-ter s. For R.C.S. it was a spoilt\nUnion meeting. For Guilds\u2014I wonder. Presumably they considered this to be a great success.\nWas it? It needed little skill and\nit involved them in an expense\nwhich they will find it hard to\njustify. The idea was not original;\nfour years ago the R.C.S. President was captured and deposited\nat Stonehenge. I think the whole\naffair was futile and ridiculous,\nI feel that inter-college rivalry\nshould be generated in ways\nwhich don't involve personal in-convenience.\nCHRIS T YEA MESSAGE FROM THE EDITOR OF PHOENIX As many of you are doubtless aware, this College maintains two\npublications. One is this newspaper. It paints a daily portrait of\nlife and activity, giving news, information, and comment. As may\nbe seen from its first two issues this year, it is at present virile,\namusing and intelligent.\nThe other is Phoenix, the Journal of Imperial College. It aims\nto reflect the College; its attitude, its problems, its interests, its\nrecreations. The content should be a kaleidoscope of thought and\nopinion ; the broader the spectrum of subjects it presents, the more\nfaithful the image it creates.\nUnfortunately, on occasion Phoenix has tended to lose touch\nwith those it represents, something for which the editors cannot\nentirely be blamed. No handful of people, however talented, can\nsustain the interest of the majority. To maintain its existence, the\nUnion journal must be nurtured by the Union. More than any other\nmagazine it is communal property, and a communal product. I hope\nyou will help to continue in this tradition.\nMEN OF OUR HALLS.\nSir Henry Tizard (1885-1959) after gaining a1 st in Chemistry,\ntook to flying. Before the War he was appointed chairman of the\nAeronautical Research Commission and he supervised the development of improved fuel, radar, the eight-gun fighter and the jet engine.\nDuring the years (1929\u201443) that he was rector, the college became\nmore closely knit, and expanded academically. On his retirement he\nbecame the government chief adviser on scientific policy, so that he\nwas responsible for the country's technical development into the\nfifties.\nFour-fifths\" of\nfop civil servants\ntake THE TIMES Thought for the day\nSo only this: these particular Top People must keep themselves fully and widely informed. They must be aware\nnot only of happenings in their particular field, but of discussion and comment on questions of the day, international\nnews, politics and the arts. For all this, they turn to THE TIMES.\nYou may not want to be a top civil servant: lots of people\ndon't. But the same is true of top dons, top businessmen, top\npoliticians. Whatever kind of top person you hope to be, it's not too early to get in training now by taking THE TIMES\nregularly. Especially since, as a student, you're entitled to it\nat half price: ask your newsagent or write to THE TIMES\nSubscription Manager.\nThe exact figure is85%. We are aware that this is a little more than\nfour-fifths: please do not write to point this out. Do write, however, if\nyou would be interested in an account of the research which produced\nthese and many other revealing figures. Who are Top People? What do\nthey think on the important issues of the day? Write to The Times\n(Department SP), Printing House Square, London EC4.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX7 COUNCIL MEET-its money again ITS MONEY AGAIN AT COUNCIL\nThe first Union Council meeting of the session was held on Tuesday 22nd October. The dire state of Union finances was the subject of much discussion ; investments had been cut which in turn\nwill lower income and the position will not improve until more money\nis forthcoming from the college. This led to th.' main discussion of\nthe meeting.\nGUILDS BROKE Bob Schroter, President of\nGuilds, asked for a supplementary\ngrant of \u00a370 for Guilds. He\nexplained that the money in the\nUnion was very short indeed; a new club had been formed, general costs had risen, and money\nsaved for re-equipping clubs had\nbeen used for other purposes;\u2014\nfor example the Boat Club had\nhad no new oars since 1946 and it\nwas doubtful if the old ones could\nbe used for Morphy Day. Chris\nTye, R.C.S. President, pointed\nout that R.C.S. funds were more\nhealthy and suggested that greater\nsavings could be made in Guilds.\nHe thought far too much money\nwas spent on social functions.\nNigel Gravette, Mines President,\nreiterated Chris Tye's remarks.\nDr. Weale after financial calculations found that C.&G. did\nnot receive such a fair proportion\nof money as the other colleges.\nThe President commiserated with\nGuilds but also said that all\nshould live within income if\nhumanly possible. After further\ndiscussion the supplement was\npassed.\nNO NEWS\nAlso discussed was the lack of\nI.C. news in Sennet. It appears\nthat it is impossible for anyone in\nI.C. to contact the person concerned in Sennet. News is sent in\nbut nothing is printed. This\nprejudicial attitude of Sennet is\ndifficult to fathom. I.C. is one of\nthe largest Colleges in the University but it has one of the\nsmallest \" items per student\"\nratio in the paper.\nPHOENIX-IN THE BALANCE Phoenix, the President informed Council, is in a serious\nposition. Recent issues, he said,\nwere unsatisfactory, with worthless content and lack of competent management. It is to be\nradically altered. Phoenix will no\nlonger be a literary magazine but\na Journal of the Union and Union\naffairs. There will be an issue at\nthe be ign ning of next term and if\nthis is not a success\u2014financially\nand in content\u2014publication will\ncease.\nI.C. MASCOT\nAmong other points discussed\nwere more telephones for South\nSide; the Refectories\u2014much of\nthe trouble here could be improved if more staff were avail-able; the Sports Centre \u2014 the\nearliest completion date is now\nOctober 1965; and the I.C. mas-cot. This, appa ren ly, is a bird\nnamed Phoenix which roosts in\nthe President's Office.\nN.J.

An Industry whose rapid expansion assures a challenging and exciting future,\nthe Central Electricity Generating Board\noffers graduates wide scope for research\nand development in an extraordinary\ndiversity of fields.\nA/ system which demands that the Board's output shall double every nine years, and\ncapital Investment greater than any other\nsingle organisation in the United Kingdom\n(at present around \u00a3 3 0 0 million annually)\nroa kea long-term research programme\nof the highest Importance.\nWe are looking for^he graduate who\nwishes to embark on a new line \u00a9f research and to make his own personal\ncontribution to this programme.\nThere are vacancies for Physicists, Metallurgists, Mathematicians, Chemists and\nEngineers in both fundamental and applied\nresearch. The fields covered Include solid\nstate physics, nuclear Instrumentation,\nfluid dynamics, high temperature chem-is try, fuel cells, behaviour of materials\nunder extreme conditions and many\nothers. The most up-to-date equipment\nis provided and staff are encouraged to\npublish original work.\nThere are also opportunities In the operational side of the industry where a two-year\ntraining scheme is available for Electrical\nand Mechanical Engineers and Physicists.\nDEPARTMENTAL NEWS\nEngineering students distressed\nor disillusioned by the cold im-personality of their work, will\nprobably be heartened to hear\nthat the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment at least, have produced a device of direct and undeniable benefit to a section of\nmankind. Dr. Swanson has designed and developed a mechanism that will be of considerable\nassistance to the wearers of artificial limbs. Until recently the\ndifferent terminal appliances that\ncan be attached to artificial arms\nto carry out various possible\nmotions of the human hand\ncould only be exchanged by the\nwearer with some difficulty. With\nDr. Swanson's design the operating mechanism engages or disengages itself automatically, and\nwith a minimum of effort.\nProfessor Spalding, also of the\nMech. Eng. Department, is working on an improvement in the design of cooling towers which he\nhopes will save the Electricity\nGenerating Board \u00a3120,000 on\nevery new power station built.\nThis saving is to brought about\nby modifying the shape of the\nair-intakes at the base of the\ntowers. The improved air flow\nwhich results, reduces the height\nto which the water to be cooled\nhas to be pumped; the overall\nreduction in the cost per foot of\nreduction in this height is of the\norder of \u00a340,000.\nDr. DeMalherbe is carrying out\nvaluable research on the internal\ncombustion engine in collaboration with the head of the Mechanical Engineering Dept., Professor O. A. Saunders. He is making measurements on the thickness of oil films between piston\nrings and cylinders and of the\nvariation in temperature in the\ncylinders. His main concern is\nto determine at what temperature\nand under what circumstances\nthe oil film breaks down, a factor which has an important bearing on the life of an internal combustion engine. The measurement of the temperature is necessarily a tricky procedure, and\nDr. DeMalherbe has developed\ntwo devices for the purpose, both\nof which have been successful.\nOne of these is a form of \" platinum paint meter \" which utilise s the variation of resistance with\ntemperature of a very thin film\nof platinum painted on the inside\nof a cylinder. The other is a new form of thermocouple on\nwhich Dr. DeMalherbe is to publish a paper shortly.\nWELLS SOCIETY\nAPOLOGISES\nAfter complaints concerning\nthe way the Wells Society went\nabout forming itself, officials of\nthe Society saw the Union President. He told them that their\naction had been wrong, and that\nthey should write and apologise\nto the S. C.C. Chairman, and then\napply to the S. C.C. in the usual\nway.\n\n"
