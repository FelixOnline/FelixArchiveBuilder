This is abad thing.\nThe first two years of my\nCollege life were enhanced\nby the weekly enjoyment of\nconvivial company in the\nUnion Bar after a game of\nRugby. As such, this made\na valued contribution to my\nvaried and fulfilling social\nlife at College. Is this to be\ndenied to future students at\nImperial College?\nSince Mr Lyttle obviously\nhas no consideration for\nhis customers, and total\ndisregard for his position\nas a purveyor of service,\nperhaps he would care to\ntake some business advice\nfrom a customer: I'd much\nprefer to do my quiet\ndrinking in the charming\nsurroundings of Southside\nBar, and if the objective is\nto smarten up appearances\nI also have a suggestion as\nto where a start could be\nmade.\nYours,\nMalcolm Gray\nElec Eng\nDisreputable\nNUS\nDear Hugh,\nIn reply to Pete Hobbis',\nletter (FELIX 731) I would\nlike to'pass on some\nrealities of the organisation\nthat K QC students have\njust affiliated to.\nThe National Union of\nStudents is a disreputable\norganisation of students,\npresent only because it is a 'closed shop' for all\nuniversities and colleges\nwho are affiliated. It spends\nthe vast majority of its over\na million pounds on an\nannual conference and\nadministration. This means\nthat the British taxpayer\nspends nearly a million\npounds on supporting an\norganisation which\nencourages policies of 'no\nplatform', denying free\nspeech, and donations from\neverything like the 1983\nNGA dispute and the 1984-5 miners' strike to\nconferences on pae do philia and transvestites.\nIf you want another\naccount of the NUS in\naction, read the account of\nthe NUS conference given\nby none other than J Martin Taylor, in last years'\nFELIX. This conference\nresults in no positive gain,\nand costs about half of the\ntotal NUS budget. Indeed,\nthe NUS is presently\naround half a million\npounds in debt, so you can\nsee why they might look\nwith a gleam in their eyes\nat Imperial College Union\nwhich runs many expensive\nand effective clubs and\nsocieties on a scale not\nseen elsewhere. Bear in\nmind, also, that when\nEdinburgh University left\nthe NUS in a span of a few\nyears they saved two\nhundred thousand pounds,\nand built a restaurant and\nbars and more with the\nmoney. Is this not of better\nbenefit to students than a 'national representation' of\nstudents, when no\ngovernment of any colour\nhas ever acted on NUS\npolicy!\nIf the NUS were\nsomehow miraculously to\nbecome voluntary, you\nmight than see some reality\ncreeping in as no-one\nwould join the present\norganisation if they had to\npay! If the NUS is so good,\nwhy is it compulsory?\nYours,\nDave Burbage\nVice Chairman IC Consoc\nComputer MScs\nAre OK\nDear Sir,\nTo put an end to a somewhat ridiculous row, I would like to correct a few\ninaccuracies included in a letter, two weeks ago, from\na3rd year computing UG, who felt compelled to\ncomplain about the\nbehaviour of a certain PG student during Artificial\nIntelligence lectures.\nFirstly, the Al lectures are\nattended by 3rd year\nComputing UG's, Computing MSc's on the\nconversion course and\nstudents on a robotics\ncourse. It so happens that\nthe offender mentioned in\nthe letter belongs to the\nrobotics course, because if\nthe 3rd years do not\nrecognise him as one of\ntheirs, neither do we.\nSecondly, although the\nobnoxious behaviour is\nindeed resented by all but\nthe offender himself, it is\nfelt that the generalisation\nthat 'provincial' universities\nare inferior to IC is far-stretched; Edinburgh\nUniversity, for one, has an\nAl department as reputable\nas, if not more than, IC's. Thirdly, some 3rd years\nmay think little of the MSc\nconversion course; to\nrestore the reputation, may\nI point out that the only\nstudent to correctly answer\na challenge in Al posed by\nProfessor Kowalski was a student on the MSc\nconversion course.\nFinally, we are\nsupposedly a free country,\nso why not have the\ncourage of your\nconvictions and allow your\nname to be printed?\nYours faithfully,\nH Guillamme\nCourse rep\nConversion MSc Computing\nStudent\n2 Friday 28 February FELIX\n\n"

A brilliant\ntactical move by Captain\nMartin Lake saw the team\nrevert to 4-4-2 for the\nsecond period. This was\nshowing signs of working\nwell and Captain Lake\ndecided it was time to call\non his last trump card to\nsave the 3rds from\nrelegation.

This\nbought both crews to a standstill. The marshall s decided to disqualify both\ncrews-this seemed\nexceptionally harsh on the\nnovice crew. Despite the\nstoppage they completed\nthe course in the second\nfastest time of their\ndivision.

With Hans Michels\nat three feeling the effects\nof flu, and Uave Morten at\nstroke making an unfit\ncomeback, the crew was\nlucky that Nigel Reynolds\nslotted in so well in the\nbow seat. The crew went\noff second and made up\nthe 22 second margin to\nthe Staines crew ahead well\nbefore the half distance\nmark. Staines refused to let\nIC through on the inside,\nand forced IC and 'Buffalo\nBill' round the outside of\nthe bend where they were\nrowing in the stream. At the\nfinish the crews finished\nlevel. A long recovery was\nneeded before returning to\nthe landing stage. The Elite\nfour had done enough to\nwin overall and give Bill\nMason an Elite win for the\nTwentieth consecutive year.\nThe Senior B VIII then\ntook to the water.

The Working\nParty has estimated the\ncost of each course to be\napproximately \u00a31400. To go\nahead they would need the\napproval of the Rector,\nProfessor Ash, and the\nsupport of the majority of\ndepartments.

This group felt that a more direct protest was\nneeded. The large but friendly police presence quickly\ncaught on and proved an efficient escort and little\nobstruction until the group reached Festival Gardens.

In\nspite of the efforts of both\nthese talented people and\nthe excellent Vincenzo\nRicotta as the car\nsalesman, the film fails\nbecause of it's dated\nnudge-nudge, wink-wink\nhumour and the lack of\nideas to fill a feature film.\nThere are some\ngenuinely funny moments,\noften involving the symbol\nof the lower middle class\naspirations, the garden\ngnome, but equally there\nare some jokes that are\nvery wide of the mark, such\nas the film-buff reference to\n'The Shining' and the\nattempt by Ian Charleston\nto murder his wife by\narranging a mid-air\ncollision The film is also\nspoilt by some over-zealous,\nediting and some intrusive\nmusic. The final line sums\nup the main characters:\n'You're a maniac, and so's that woman, you deserve\neach other'.\nA small German film\nwhich I was very impressed\nwith when I saw it last year\nhas finally been released in\nthis country. I think that it\nis well worth a visit. The\nidea behind Out of Order is\na very simple one, but the\nskill is in the telling.\nOn a Friday evening four\nemployees get into a lift in\norder to leave for the\nweekend. The lift then gets\nstuck. The elderly man\nclings to his briefcase and\nthe young messenger, Pit,\nand the slightly past-it\nexecutive, Jdrg begin to\ncompete for the art tractive advertising woman, Marion.\nAlmost the entire film\ntakes place in the confines\nof the lift, but both the\ncontrol of space and the\ntension in the relationships\nis skillfully directed by Carl\nSchenkel. The\nclaustrophobia of the lift\ninterior enhances the\nfeeling of depth when the\nlift shaft is shown in several\nvery tense escape attempts.\nAlthough an apparently\npredictable story there are\nsome clever twists and\nsome exciting action\nscenes. I was river ted for\nmost of the film.\nOut of Africa tells the story i already invested her money\nof Karen Dinesen, who > in a coffee farm, a riskier, \u2022\nthough he believed less'\ndemanding enterprise.\nTheir life together wasn't\\ everything she'd hoped for,]\nand his incorrigible (\npromiscuity soon put a\\ strain on their marriage. It,\nwas under such conditions\nthat Karen grew to love\nKenya and its people and!\nto count on the friendship;\nI of two maverick pioneers,\\\nBerkley Cole and Denyst*\"\"\nFinch Hatton, who stole her!\nheart.\nIt is a relief to find a 'big;\nname' film which does not i simply fall back upon the/\nreputation of those big t names. Meryl Streep, as\\\nKaren, is simply brilliant!\nand together with RobertX\nRedford, who plays Denysu\ncarries the film through its/\nrw cT and a half hours. The)\nIrest of the cast, although/\nJvery much supporting,!\nprovide a splendid dramatic!\nbackdrop, particularly l Michael Kitchen as Berkley)\nCole. Just wait for the U~ start a new life with her>\nSwedish cousin, Baron/ Bror Blixen, and raise1 cattle. Bror, however, had j Less than Zero appears to\nbe one of the books of the\nmoment. Hailed by\nreviewers as a modern\n'Catcher in the Rye' and\nselling millions in the\nStates, it seems set to\ncombine pulp sensation\nwith depressing social\ncommentary. Less Than\nZero is a description of the\nlifestyle of the children of\nthe decadent rich in Los\nAngeles.\nI suspect this will be the\nsort of book people either\nlove or loathe which leaves\none in a sort of desolate\nmiddle ground when trying\nto review it. The writing has\na curious but striking style\nwhich uses the present\ntense in a rather chain-of-thought manner. The story,\nif that is the right word,\ndescribes the central\ncharacter's experiences\nduring a month's holiday\nback home from college in\nthe East. The world of rich\nadolescents in Los Angeles\nportrayed as a mindless\nchain of parties and\ncruising chic bars and\nclubs in flashy cars. The\ncharacters, trapped in a sort of emotion less hell, are\nshown seeking kicks in\ndrugs and snuff movies\nwhiles their parents live in\nsome separate uncaring\nworld. Clay's13 year old\nsister boasts to him in front\nof their mother that they\ndon't need to steal his\ncocaine as they have their\nown supplier, while later he\nfinds one of his friends has\nbeen forced into\nhomosexual prostitution to\npay off drug debts.\nWhether less than Zero is\nmeant as a profound\ncommentary on the moral\ncorruption of excessive\nwealth or whether it is\nmeant as an excuse for the\ndecadent to demand\nsympathy I'm not sure,\nthats up to you. Can you\nhave sympathy for coked\nout characters without the\nwill even to think beyond\nthe next expensive thrill?\nClay finally draws the line\nat faking part in the gang\nrape of a12 year-old, but\nwhile he begins to distance\nhimself from his family and\nfriends the book leaves the\nimpression of a teenage\npopulation with nowhere to\ngo but down.\nThe Year of the Quiet\nSun deserves a longer\ntreatment than I have space\nto give it here, so I 'll\nreiterate the important\npoint, it's excellent.\nPolish settlers are trying\nto recreate their lives in\nwar-torn Europe in an area\nthat is now Western\nPoland, but was previously\nGermany. Against this\nbackground a shy\nAmerican volunteers for a driving job because he is\ntoo shattered to return\nhome. Soon he meets a widow and they fall for\neach other.\nThey unfortunately have\nno common language and\ntheir clumsy attempts to\ncommunicate both intimate\ncomments and escape\ndistrust that heralds the\nCold War. The whole film is\ndelightful and the finale\ndream sequence genuinely\nmoving, a sad but\nheartwarming experience.\nAnd finally Mr Love,\nanother sweet little film\nfrom Goldcrest. This one\ntells the tale of Mr Lovelace\na Southport gardner. At\nnearly fifty after 28 years of\nmarriage,he decides he needs\nsome love and in a gently\nbeguiling way charms the\nlocal womenfolk before his\nuntimely death\n(prophetically referred to\nby one of his affairs in a comment about her\npassion, spiders).\nAlthough lacking some of\nthe wit of some of Puttman's\\ kM O? Nicplans have to be done\nthrough an inappropriate\ninterpreter. This device\nprovides much of the\nfrustration and poignancy\nof the film whilst at the\nsame time reflecting the\nmutual international\nHE UE6 Afiftirt?\nother productions it does\nnevertheless contain some\nfine character is ation from\nBarry Jackson as Mr Love,\nsuch as the wonderfully\neccentric Theo, Maurice\nDenham, and the brilliant\nwould-be-actress-but-usherette, Melani, Julia\nDeakin.\n10 Friday 28 February FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Fencing\nRugby\nICFC had a busy week last\nweek with two matches\nagainst other local\n'colleges. On Wednesday\nwe defeated Kings Collega\nin a two weapon match.A comfortable 6-3 margin\ndecided the foil where the\nteam's only problem was a disagreement over what\ncons it it u esa stop-hit. The\ne pee match could not be\ncompleted due to a Kings\nfencer breaking their only\nleft handed e pee. Thus\ninstead of winning 7-2 , we\nhad to make do with 6-2.\nWorthy of note was David\nMatthews' two victories at\ne pee, a weapon with which\nhe is not familiar.\nOn Friday we had our\nreturn match against UC, winning by 18 fights to 9.\nUC were weaker in their\nfoil team and we won 5-4.\nAgain the sabre was a whitewash, we won 8-1.\nThe e pee score was 5-4 but\nwith an indicator of plus 17,\nmeans the match was not\nas close as it appears.\nThere was also a novices\nmatch of twelve bouts which\nresulted in a66 draw. John\nFranks fought well, winning\nall his fights and c once e ding only four hits.\nThe next match is against\nQM C on Friday 7 March.\nRifle\nInter C CU small bore pistol\nmatch\nRC S695C&G692 Last Wednesday saw RCS and C&G compete in the\nannual pistol match. Mines\nwere unable to field a team\nthis year.\nRCS with their very\nexperienced team,\nthree quarters of last years\nUniversity of London team,\nwere expecting to win\neasily.C&G fielded an\ninexperienced team; this\nwas the first competition\nmost had shot in.\nIn the end the match was\nextremely close with RCS winning by 3 points. The\ntop individual scores of the\nday were 178 from Steve\nBrooker and E Blance, The\nformer winning on the\nnumber of 'Bulls' soc red, and stopping RCS winning\neverything.\nIC 38pts WASPS 3pts ICRFC 1st XV entertained a WASPS XV on Saturday in\nbitterly cold conditions and\nin a frozen pitch. It proved\nto be an opportunity for the\nIC team to work on forward\nsolidity and run through\nsome dashing back moves.\nAll the scoring in the first\nhalf was attributed to\nFolland as he crossed for\nthree tries, one of which he\nconverted. The second try\nwas the pick of these as it\nfollowed excellent first\nphase possession as a neat\nbreak by Anderson running\nat full-pace. Wasps only\nreply was a first half\npenalty.\nThe second half saw the\nIC pack tear into the\nopposition and produce a constant stream of good\nsecond phase possession.\nThe backs consistently\nbroke through the Wasps\ncover releasing Seccombe,\nthe flying Welshman, on\nnumerous runs. Twice he\ntouched down but missed\nout on his hat-trick by\ndeliberately allowing a Wasps prop to catch him\njust before full-time whistle.\nIt was 'Boogie-woogie'\nGoetz who again scored\ntwo tries and shone for IC\nin the back-row. He\nrecieved good support in\nthe mauls from Chris\nDancer, ugly as ever, and a solid second-row platform\nin the shape of Roly and\nRawell. Despite earlier fears\nover injuries only Steve\nPierer-Rives sustained a knock, but nothing to keep\nhim out of next Sunday's( March 2!) Gutterridge\nfinal-weather permitting!\nBadminton\nU AU Ladies\nTeam Championships\nThe first game was our first\npair, Robin Martin and\nSarah Threadgold, against\nLeed's first pair. Despite\nthe fact that the Leeds pair\ncontained the individual\nUAU ladies singles winner,\nthey proved minimal\ntrouble for IC, who (very\nnervously) beat them in\nstraight games to the\ncheering of the rest of the\nIC Team.\nThen it was the turn of\nIC's end pair consisting of\nJulie Goodeve and Susan\nYates to play Leed's2 nd pair. Much to the relief of\nall the IC team they won\nwith style, giving IC a20 lead.\nInspired by the previous\n2 games, IC's3 rd pair of\nHelen Gregory and Farida\nKateli went out against\nLeeds 3rd pair and\nannihilated them with ease\nto give IC a30 lead,\nlooking extremely\npromising.\nOur first pair of Robin\nand Sarah then continued\ntheir winning streak to win\ntheir next two games. The\nsecond pair beat the third\npair but decided that they'd better let the Leeds 1st pair\nwin. The third pair\nsurpassed them seles in\nbeating the Leed's2 nd pair,\nbut were unable to beat the\nfirst pair.\nThese results gave IC an\nincredible 7-2 win over\nLeeds University to take\nthem into the finals the\nfollowing day against\nLoughborough who beat\nBirmingham 5-4.\nDetermined not to be\noverawed by\nLoughborough's reputation\nor their supporters, IC went\nout ready to do battle.\nUnfortunately, a shock\nresult occured in the very\nfirst game when\nLoughborough had an\nunprecedented win over\nour 1st pair, which\nsomewhat shook our\nwinning strategy.\nRealising that the pressure\nwas now on them to win,\nthe 2nd pair went out, to\ntry and do justice to a wonderful IC ladies team.\nAfter narrowly losing the\nfirst game 15-11, they\nfought back to the take the\nsecond 15-9. With\neverybody nervously\nwatching and praying for\nan IC victory, they\nstruggled at the beginning\nof the third game and were\n8-3 down at the change of\nends. Despite a desperate\neffort to rethink their\ntactics and come out on\ntop, they were unable to\nbeat Loughborough and\nrather sadly lost 15-5, thus\nalmost sealing the fate of\nthe match.\nFrom that point, all our\npains managed to beat an\nextremely weak third pair\nfrom Loughborough, but\nalthough our first pair beat\nthe Loughborough second\npair, our second pair lost to\nLoughborough's first as\ndid our third, and this left\nhe score at 4-4 with one\ngame left to play our third\npair against Loughboough's second pair.\nOur third pair put up a tremendous fight, but\nun fortuna tley for IC were\nunable to overcome the\nstrength of Loughborough\nand lost, thus giving a final\nscore of a54 win for\nLoughborough.\nIC Rugby 1st XV (Hoops) in action on Saturday\nFELIX Friday 28 February FELIX\n\n"

The Apollo\nproject gave us the Teflon\nnon-stick lavatory seat,\nuntil complaints about\nserious spinal injuries, from\npeople who kept on falling\noff, ditched this idea. Not\ndiscouraged, the inventors\nreturned with the far more\nuseful non-stick frying pan.\nA later project with Teflon\nball-pens also proved to be\nill-advised: the sight of\npeople chasing round\noffices after runaway pens\nwas deemed to be a major\ncause of stress and deaths\namong yuppies. So\nergonomics experts ruled\nthat the pens were unfit for\nuse.\nSimilarly, research into\noil-drilling has bequeathed\nreusable chewing gum unto\nthe human race.

The\nsalem an has evolved a jaw\ncapable of prolonged\nenthusing over pictures of\ngerbil-eating pygmy tribes\nfrom the wilds of Guildford.\nHowever this highly\nspecialised mechanism\nrequires constant exercise,\nand before the advent of\nthis miracle invention\nsalesmen had been found\nbetween houses with totally\nlocked faces, unable to\nspeak.

May we take the\nopportunity to dispel a few\nmis-conceptions which may\nhave arisen from this\narticle, printed\nanonymously as club\npublicity without the\nknowledge of the\ncommittee.\nFirstly, the S&G committee exists for a variety of purposes, but\ntheir task is definitely not\nto organise routes for all\nand sundry. Members on\nweekends are assumed to\nbe old enough to decide for\nthemselves what they wish\nto attempt, and are only\ndiscouraged from acting on\ntheir decision, when to do\nso would involve unsafe\nactions (such as walking\nalone in winter conditions).\nThe writer's attitude is\ntotally unrepresentative of\nthe majority of S&G members. Fortunately for\nthe club many of*our more\nexperienced members are\nwilling to tread familiar\npaths in order to introduce\nbeginners to the delight of\nTryfan, the Glyders, the\nSnowdon Horseshoe etc.\nAlso, there are many ways\nup a mountain, not just the\nmost popular routes-several\ngroups were ice-climbing\non Snowdon on the\nweekend in question.\n' To dispel any fears, S&G don't walk about in twelves.\nThree totally independant\ngroups headed up Tryfan\nthat day, and two decided\nto turn back in the face of\ndeteriorating conditions.\nAs for exploring, within\nthe last year or so, the club\nhas organised weekends to\nSnowdonia, the Lakes,\nYorkshire, Derbyshire, the\nMendips, Cornwall, the\nGower and Pembrokeshire\nas well as week-long trips\nto Glencoe, Ireland and the\nLake District. During the\nsummer there were two\nclub tours to the\nPolish/Czech Tatras and\nthe Italian Alps. This\nEaster, we will be visiting\nSkye, and the summer tour\nthis year is to the Pyrenees.\nHardly limiting in outlook...\nThe activities available on\nthese trips include winter\nand rock climbing, caving,\nscrambling and walking\naccording to the interests\nof those present and the\narea visited.\nAs with all these things,\nwhen the opportunity is\nthere it's up to you to make\nof it what you will.\nYours,\nS&G Committee 1985-86\nApathy Rules\nDear Sir,\nA week and half ago I went\non a fascinating trip to\nRolls Royce Engines,\norganised by the Industrial\nSociety. We travelled in the\ncomfort of a British Rail\ntrain, and a van was waiting\nat Coventry station to\ntransfer us to the\nplant...and the whole trip\nwas absolutely free! And\nyet, only seven students\ntook advantage of this\namazing opportunity.\nWhat the hell is the\nmatter with us? We will\nnever have these\nopportunities again, so why\ndo we not use the facilities\navailable to us? On arrival\nat the plant, our guide\nasked how many of us were\nfrom Mech Eng.

You are the\npeople who will be working\nin this sort of company, so\nshouldn't you be finding\nout what these places get\nup to?\nPlease do not take this\nattack personally.

I propose that a new club\nshould be started; namely\nthe Apathetic Society.\nEveryone will automatically\nbe a member unless they\nsign up not to be. I feel\nconfident that such a society would not lose a single member.\nActively yours,\nMichael Van Messel\nPhysics 2\nMoonies Respond\nDear Hugh,\nI read Alastair Macleod's letter in last week's FELIX\nwith some irritation. It was\nadmittedly a masterly feat\nof journalism, skilfully\nusing innuendo all the way\nthrough to cast aspersions\nboth on the academic\ncredibility of Dr Barker in\nher study of the Unification\nChurch, and on the\nintegrity of the Unification\nmovement as a whole. But\nalso masterly was the way\nin which he omitted most\nof the relevant facts\nsurrounding Dr Barker's study\u2014and invented a few\nof his own\u2014in the process.\nTherefore, lets me attempt\nto set the record straight.\n1) Documentary Evidence\nMr Macleod suggests that\nthe arguments put forward\nby Mr Balcomb in defence\nof CARP were supported\nonly by Dr Barker's one\nstudy. In fact Mr Balcomb's letter was submitted to\nFELIX with a large quantity\nof supporting documentary\nevidence. In any case,\nother studies refuting the\n'brainwashing' hypothesis\nwere alluded to in that\nletter, a fact ignored by Mr\nMacleod. Among the\nleading sociologists who\nreject this hypothesis are\nProfessor J H Fichter, SJ and Dr Bryan Wilson (All\nSouls College, Oxford) who\nis probably the leading\nauthority in this country on\nthe study of new religious\nmovements.\n2) Dr Barker was 'chosen'\nby the Unification Church\nMr Macleod also states\nthat 'Dr Barber (sic) was\n'chosen' by the Unification\nChurch to conduct her\nstudy s( sic)'. If, by his use\nof quotation marks, he\nmeans to suggest that the\nChurch agreed to cooperate with the study,\nthen his claim is correct.\nHowever, he goes on to\nsuggest that this 'choosing'\nmight in some way have\nprejudiced the results of\nthe study. It should be\nnoted in this regard that\nthe study won Dr Barker a doctorate and the 1985\nDistinguishing Book Award\nof the Society for the\nScientific Study of Religion,\nthe latter being the most\npre sti go us international\naward for books on\nreligion. Dr Barker's work\nwas particularly noted for\nher inscrutable\nmethodology and\nobjectivity. Mr Macleod\nappears to concede this\nwhen he states th t she\n'quite rightly draws\nconclusions only as far as\nthe volume of evidence\npermits.'\n3) Evidence of\n'Brainwashing'\nOn the subject of\n'brainwashing', Mr\nMacleod's comments in his\nletter leave one with the\nimpression that Dr Barker's conclusions on this subject\nare ambivalent: that\nmembers say that it doesn't happen and 'leave rs' say\nthat it does. Dr Barker in\nfact found that, out of 1,000\nattenders at a Unification 2-day seminar, only 'a few'\nmade any suggestion in the\ndirection of undue\npersuasion. Of the four\nstrongest statements made\n(Barker at PP 159-160),\nnone even use the term\n'brainwashing'. Elsewhere\nin her book, however, she\ngives her own opinion: that\nuse of the term to describe\nconversion into the\nUnification Church is\ntotally unjustified;\n4) 'Political activities of the\nUC and 'Divine Deception'.\nMr Macleod also alludes\nmysteriously to 'political\nactivities' supposedly\nundertaken by the\nUnification Church. I cannot see that there is\nanything unusual in a church involving itself\npolitically. In fact, I would\nfind it hard to think of a church which did not. He\nfurther alludes to a 'unification concept of\n'Divine Deception'. In over\nseven years of membership\nin the Unification Church, I have never heard this term\nused.\nIn conclusion, I can only\nre pre at Mr Balcomb's plea\nfor all IC students to find\nout for themselves the truth\nabout CARP and the\nReverend Moon, and not to\ntrust the jaundiced\nopinions of such as Mr\nMacleod.\nYours sincerely,\nDr Colin Turfus\nCARP\nFriday 28 February FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "World exclusive\nThe Yanks Are\nComing\nAcademic staff at Imperial\nCollege are concerned that the\nclassification of research work\nby American officials in\nconnection with SDI will\njeo pardi se important civil\nprojects. It is believed that\nresearch work carried out at\nImperial and a number of other\nBritish universities will soon be\nplaced under American\nscrutiny. Research with\npotential military applications is\nexpected to be placed on the\nU.S Military Critical\nTechnologies List (MCTL) with\nsubsequent restrictions in the\nuse and publication of it's findings.\nThe academics are worried\nthat the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding signed by the\nthen Secretary of State for\nDefence Michael Heseltine and\nAmerican Defence Secretary\nCaspar Weinberger allows the\nAmericans to classify British\nresearch.\nThe Pentagon have initiated a study by Mr Paul Hopler.the\nChief Technology Analyst at the\nDepartment of Defence, who is\nres posible for the MCTL's annual updating. Mr Hopler has\ndescribed the study as 'a general programme looking into\nforeign capability jn very\nadvanced technologies'. The\nstudy will produce an interim\nreport in April followed by a full\nreport on NATO members and\nJapan. The possible extension\nof the US Export Administration\nAct, which restricts exportation\nof sensitive technologies\nthrough the Coordinating\nCommittee of Multilateral\nExport Control (COCOM) is\nnow being considered in\nCongress. The implication is\nthat research work may be\nadded to the MC TL along with\nsensitive products. It is believed\nthat preventing technologies\nwhich may have a future\nmilitary application from\nappearing on the market is\nmore effective than restricting\nexports.\nSources have revealed that\nrepresentatives from BK\nDynamics and the Institute For\nDefence Analysis will arrive at\nthe American Embassy\nsometime next week to examine\na list of companies and\nacademics working on research\nwith potential military\napplications. It is believed that\nImperial College is one of the\ninstitutions to appear on the list.\nSpeaking in the Commons on\nWednesday Norman Lamont MP\nsaid that 'United States\nauthorities do not require the\nBritish government's approval\nbefore approaching British\nacademic groups'\nChris Moss, the secretary of\nthe Computing and Social\nResponsibility group at IC told\nFELIX that he hoped 'people\nwill tell the companies a minimum amount' should the\nvisit take place. Professor\nKowalski of the Computing\nDepartment felt that the\ncompanies would not exert\ndirect pressure on people in the\ndepartment in order to ensure\nthat research work is kept\nclassified. He hinted that\nindirect pressure may be\napplied when he said 'the MOD could become a more ag gre sive member of Alvey'.\nRichard Ennals resigned his\npost at IC in order to outline the\npossible dangers which could\nfollow the signing of the\nMemorandum of Understanding.\nHe feels that the British\ngovernment has been\n'hoodwinked' and were unaware\nof these dangers. He also\nbelieves that SDI may be more\noffensive than defensive. He\ncited General Abrahamson head\nof the SDI office in Washington,\nwho stated that SDI was 'a shield to protect US missiles'.\nHe added that it would be\neasier to use the SDI\ntechnology to destroy cities\nrather than to destroy moving\nmissiles. 'If classification were\nto go ahead, British civil\nprogrammes would not have\naccess to the technology they\nrequire', he said. He feels that\nthe Government will 'seek to\nextricate itself from this stupid\narrangement as the implications\nbecome clearer. I am prepared\nto take the matter to the\nAmerican Supreme Court\nwithout \"due process of law\"'.\nA spokesman from the\nAmerican Embassy in London\nconfirmed that General\nAbrahamson did indeed say that\nSDI would shield American\nmissiles. He pointed out that\nthis was only part of the story\nand had to be viewed in the\nlight of SDI's main objective to\nmake ICBMs redundant. He\nadded that he didn't think laser\nweapons would be sufficiently\npowerful to destroy cities. When\nquestioned about the possible\nclassification of British research\nwork he confirmed that IDA will\nbe sending a team over to\n'identify technologies which will\nhave future military\napplications'. He went on to say\n'the same protection that the US\nplaces on its research will be\nplaced on British research'.\nAlthough he felt that the United\nStates had no legal right to tell\nthe UK to classify research, 'the\nUS government in cooperation\nwith the British government\ncould classify research'.\n-7-Orctiestra rehearsing for tonight's concert of Mahler.

    "content": "Insecure Beit\nDear Sir,\nWhilst Is y mpa this e with\nSouthside Security\nproblems, it is nothing\ncompared with those of\nBeit Hall. Most of the halls\nhave doors which are\nclosed early in the evenings\nif not all day, whereas the\ndoors to Beit are only\nclosed at Midnight. The\ndoors are not properly self-locking either, so that they\nmay remain open at any\ntime of the day or night.\nAlso, being in the Union\nbuilding, Beit is the centre\nof a large throughput of\npeople. In addition, Hall\nfacilities seem to be let out\nto outsiders eg during the\nHyde Park Relays and\nNational Brass Band\nChampionships without the\nresidents being informed. It\nis not fun to wake up on a Saturday morning to find\nthe already inadequate\nshowers used by total\nstrangers, and like last\nyear, the male and female\nconveniences had been\ntemporarily swapped over.\nAll this leads to a very\nun secure Hall, and this is\nshown by the state of the\nTV Lounge in the\nmornings, the thefts of the\nnewspapers, and as\nrecently, a minor fire in one\nof the kitchens. The\nSecurity guards in Beit do\na marvellous job, but it\nappears that the rules for\nBeit are different. Why?\nThe problem could easily\nbe solved by the\ninstallation of 3 proper\nlocks and three entry\nphones as with the other\nhalls and homes.\nYours sincerely,\nTony Spencer\nEx-Beit Hall Resident\nForget The Ratio\nSir,\nI am sick and tired of\ncertain members of the\ncollege who insist on\nbringing to light the ratio of\nsexes at IC.\nFirst it was FELIX with its\n'Questionaire', and now the\nWomen's Officer, Christine\nTaig has brought up the\nsubject. It seems to me that\nthe more this topic is\nraised, the more self-conscious women will\nbecome, and also the\nsexual divide will increase.\nTo be honest I do not\nnotice the lack of women in\nmy year, where I admit the\nratio of 1 in 4 is above\naverage, but I am not\nintimidated by the ratio\nsocially either, despite\nhaving been brought up in\na totally female\nenvironment, and I couldn't care less if I was the only\nwoman in the Union Bar on\na Mines Bar Night.\nAs for the idea of positive\ndiscrimination to get more\nwomen into the College. If\nanything would serve to\nlower women's credibility in\nScience and Technology in\ngeneral, and Imperial\nCollege in particular, it\nwould be a situation where\nmen could turn round to\nwomen and say 'You're\nonly here because you are\nfemale'.\nPerhaps my view is not\nrepresentative of the\ngeneral feeling among\nwomen in the College, but I cannot believe I am the\nonly one to think this way.\nYours equally and anti-disc rim in a tori ly f!) Penny Ottway\nChemistry 1\nFELIX Error 1\nDear FELIX,\nThank you for printing our\nopinion article about\nBarclays in last weeks\nFELIX. There was however\na printing error. It should\nhave read that 77% of all\nurban black South Africans\ninterviewed in the Gallup\npoll supported international\nsanctions against South\nAfrica, as do black church\nleaders and opposition\npoliticians.\nBarclays' involvement in\nSouth Africa and Namibia\ncannot be overstated and\nSWAP O have said that 'the\nwithdrawal of Barclays\nfrom our country and the\ncessation of its activities in\nSouth Africa would hasten\nthe achievement of peace\nand justice in Namibia and\nSouthern African as a whole'.\nBecause the majority of\npeople tend to remain with\ntheir first bank, students\nhave always been of vital\nimportance to the banks.\nMany organisations of all\nkinds and countless\nindividuals have withdrawn\ntheir accounts from\nBarclays. Since 1980 the\nBank has lost accounts\nwith a total annual turnover\nof over \u00a36 billion due to the\nboycott. Hopefully Barclay?\nwill realise that they are\nprospering in Southern\nAfrica at the expense of\ntheir UK Interests.\nPlease come to the U GM on 6 March and support the\nmotion against Barclays\nadvertising in ICU\npublications.\nThank you,\nHugh Rubin\nMech Eng 2\nFELIX Error 2\nDear Sir,\nI know how the Bishop of\nDurham feels to be quoted\nout of context in the press.\nTo avoid excommunication\nor possible lightening\nstrikes on the Queens\nTower for apparently\nstating that Jesus was a 'good moralist and\npreacher but would have\nbeen regarded as a lunatic\nif he made his claims\ntoday'. I would like to state\nbriefly the main points of\nthe talk last week to clear\nup any possibly confusion.\nFirstly, Jesus a person\nworth looking at because of\nthe major effect his three\nyears of public ministry has\nhad on world history.\nSecondly, many people\nthink of him as being a great moral teacher without\nreally knowing much about\nwhat he taught. Many tend\nto forget the claims he\nmade about himself to be\nthe Messiah, Saviour, one\nwho embodied and\ndemonstrated God to the\nworld, who forgave sin and\nshowed the way to a new\nand full life in relationship\nwith God. It is those claims\nthat are the foundation of\nChristian belief.\nThese claims do not give\nroom for saying that Jesus\nwas just a good moral\nteacher', that option is not\nreally left open for us. He\nwas either completely\ncrazy; completely bad, or\nlying to people or he was\nwho he claimed to be.\nI have, myself, become\nconvinced of the latter\nthrough looking at the\nevidence and through\npersonal experience of God\nin my life.\nIt is for everyone to make\nup their own mind on this\narea. If the claims of Jesus\nare true, then the decision\nas to whether we accept\nthem or not becomes vitally\nimportant. If they are not,\nthen the whole of\nChristianity should be\nrelegated to just being an\ninteresting piece of history.\nEither way, what\nresponsibly person rejects\nsomething out of hand\nwithout giving it some\npersonal thought and\npractical investigation.\nYours sincerely,\nRoger Preece\nMB ft\nA in\nSTUD IE S JJ TRAVEL \u00a9\nG( ft\nz0ULU Travel, Imperial College,\nSherfield Building,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7.

    "content": "Engineering!No Thanks?\nOK take a break from those\nillegible illustrations and\nirrelevant equations for a moment. Think about what\nyou want to achieve when\nyou leave IC. Those who\ntook part in Gary Werskey's discussion with the Ap Tech society will know\nwhat this is about.\nAs a school leave r, you\nmust have had some\nenthusiasm for engineering.\nDon't let the academic\nestablishment get you\ndown! You may be fed up\nwith all the high powered\ntechnical courses, which\nbear very little resemblance\nto reality. But persevere!\nYou must nurture that\ndesire for a profession\nwhich offers one of the\nmost exciting, creative and\nsocially beneficial careers.\nAs an Engineer you will\nbe able to develop original\nand useful products, apply\nabstract knowledge to\nsolving practical problems,\nsee the results of your\nachievements and be\nsatisfied with the\nrecognition that you are an\nessential member of\nsociety, who holds the key\ns to wealth creation and\nprofitability.\nChrist! You ought to be\nsinging and dancing in the\nstreets at the thought of\nsuch prospects! What more\ncould anybody want? The\nfuture of society is in your\nhands. If you are a thoroughbred Engineer,\nyou are destined to make\nthe world a better place-and be recognised for it. If\nonly you would stand up\nand fight for what you\nwant.\n'What a load of crap!' I hear you utter as you reach\nfor another accountancy\napplication form. 'I 've been\nin industry and seen what\nhas happened to previous\ngraduate engineers, ie hard\nwork, low pay, little\nresp on sib lit y and slim\nprospects. Give me a bowler hat, a nine to five\njob, good prospects and\nthe sweet smell of M***y. I don't care about the future\nof society for the creation\nof wealth. I am quite happy\nto provide a parasitic\nservice and let someone\nelse develop the means to\npay for my exorbitant\nsalary. I don't want to\nimprove society or create\nsomething useful nor am I interested in feeling the\nexhilaration of\ntechnological sucess.\nBesides, I have developed\nan alle gy to s war fe ga!' You must realise that\nthose 'Victims-Engineers'\nwere not yourself. Your\ncompany is not what it was\nthen. And even if it is, there\nare tremendous\nengineering pos sib li ties with other more\nprogressive companies.\nThe great wheel of industry\nis starting to turn again and\nis hungry for new talent.\nYou have got to recognise\nwhat you want to achieve\nin life, and have realistic\nexpectations of your\ncareer.\nI am not saying that there\nwon't be any problems,\nbecause there will be\nplenty. You will have to\nstart learning some\nengineering for a start-IC\nwill have taught you little of\nreal practical use. There is\nno substitute for knowledge\ngained through hard\nexperience. You will have\nto a quaint yourself with\nnew products, processes,\ncustomers and suppliers.\nThis is bound to be tedious\nat times. You will also have\nto get to know the people\nyou work with, and make\nsuse that you will enjoy\ntheir company day after\nday. You will have to cope\nwith conflicts your work\nmay create. There are\nalways going to be times\nwhen you get disillusioned\nwith everything, and cannot\nsee any way forward.\nBut these problems are\nnot unique to engineering.\nWhy forsake a brilliant\nprofession when faced with\ndifficulties which will be\nencountered in any exigent\noccupations? The 'bowler\nhat' alternative may offer\nbetter short term promotion\nand financial prospects. It\nmay hand you convincing\ncareer paths on a plate. But\nyou would be obtuse to\naccept. What would you\nachieved Where is the\ncreative excitement? Why\ndo someone else's dirty\nwork, when you could be\ndoing you own-and actually\ncreate something\nworthwhile in the process?\nDon't be like a rat-leaping on to another raft\nmerely because of its\ncosmetic appearance.\nThink about the water that\nkeeps the raft afloat! Who\nnecessitates audits? Who\nissues the shares on which\nCity sharks gleefully make\na killing? Who creates the\nveal th and in turn provides\nsome thing in which to\ninvest the we at h?I am not\nbelittling those in financial\nworld. Industry cannot\ns ut vive without them. But\nwhere is the intrigue for\nintelligent and potentially\ncreative students?\nAs an Engineer, you will\nbe able to improve things\nfor so many people.\nIndustry is starved of the\ntechnically capable such as\nyourself. The opportunities\nand long term personal\nprospects in engineering\nare te men dous. But you\nwill have to maintain a constructive approach as* to\nwhat you want to achieve,\nand keep making sensible\ndemands in order to\nsucceed.\nYou had better take down\nthose equations now-There's a remote possibility\nyou might need them one\nday!\nOh! And remember, it's 'Engineering?-Yes please!'\nMark Field\nBack To\nSchool\nAre there any female\nstudents who would be\nwilling to return to their\nschools and talk to other\ngirls about the\nopportunities available to\nthem in Science and\nEngineering, especially at\nIC. Although school girls\ntheoretically have the same\nchances as boys, it is still\ntrue that only a small\nproportion of them choose\nscience and technology\nsubjects for their sixth form\nand further education. This\nis often because they are\nunaware of the pos sib li ties. Thus many girls miss out\non an interesting,\nchat leng ing and lucrative\neducation and career; and\nindustry and academics\nmiss out on a lot of ability.\nA new scheme, approved\nby the rector, will enable\nwomen students to claim\ntheir expenses from\nCoilege when they return\nto talk at their schools. This\nis a simple and practical\nway to pass on to younger\ngirls, who may never even\nhave considered a future in\nscience and engineering,\nthe benefits of your\nsuccess and experience.\nThe idea is to talk to girls\nat pre O 'level, Pre A 'level\nand pre UCC A stages,\nthese being the times when\ncrucial decisions are made.\nInformation Packs\nIn future a video will be\navailable to back up the\ntalk.\nIf anybody is willing to\n'spread the word' in this\nway (and have a weekend\nat home into the bargain)\ncontact me, or Margaret\nCunningham the Senior\nTutor for Women, (Huxley\n422, X5053) for further\ndetails.\nChristine Taig\nTemp Women's Officer\nMech Eng 3\nPolitics &\nPiss-Artistry\nI'm the RCS Academic\nAffairs Officer. I'm supposed to see to it that\nthe students of the RCS get\nfairly represented. Last\nFriday I witnessed some\noutrageous behaviour on\nbehalf of the C& GAA O and the Union President\nwhich should be publicized\nin the name of fair\nrepresentation.\nThe Undergraduate\nStudies Committee is\ncollecting lots of\ninformation about the\nundergraduates in Collegesome via Heads of\nDepartments, more via the\nStudents Union. Professor\nBlow, who works very hard\nas chairman of this\ncommittee, in the interests\nof the students must\ndepend on the information\nsupplied to him by the\nUnion. It must therefore be\nof the highest calibre and\nas thorough as possible.\nThis requires a lot of time\nand experience, but is quite\npossible (theoretically) for\nthe Academic Affairs\nOfficers and Union\nPresident to achieve;\nhowever this opportunity to\ncollect realistic an\nstatistically valid\ninformation, with which the\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee can begin to\ndefine our problems has\nbeen squandered. Here is\nhow:\nThe objective is to decide\nwhat the students need and\nthen 'prove' so by survey.\nTo this end, a preliminary\nquestionnaire was\ntor mula ted and sent to 'all'\nacademic reps in College. I made a set of suggested\nquestions to add into the\nquestionnaire, which was\nignored by the President.\nSupposedly on the basis of\nthe results of this\nquestionnaire, a simpler\nand more direct\nquestionnaire has been\nformulated and is now\nbeing sent out to three\nsample year groups, Chem\nEng 4, Civ Eng 2, and\nMaths 2. According to the\nPresident these year-groups were selected\nbecause they are of\naverage size. According to\na more reliable source, and\nwhich is substantiated by\nmy own experience they\nwere selected because they\nare known to be\nparticularly dissatisfied\nyear-groups, who would\nthen given an extreme\nresponse to this second\nquestionnaire. Remarkably\nenough, its content\ncoincides with what the\nC& GAA O purports to have\nmaintained all along-ie that\nthe main areas of concern\nare multitude of particular\ndetails about the courses.\nViz:- Too theoretical, too\nmuch work required,\nboring, lectures too full,\ncoursework too demanding,\nteachers uninspiring, poor\ncourse structure,\ninadequate tutorial.\nNotably, if you agree with\nany of these criticisms you\nindicate so by ringing the\n'plus 2'; the minuses are for\nwhen you are 'too' happy\nwith your course!\nMyself, being 1) not\nre known ed for turning up\nto all Union Meetings, and\n2) re known ed for housing\nthat rare quality known as\nmorality, was not consulted\nas to the content or format\nof those questionnaire, or\nto whom it would be sent\nand why.\nIt is proposed that on the\nbasis of what Chem Eng 4,\nCiv Eng 2, Maths 2 say on\nthese subjects, we can\nstate the opinion of the\nstudent body as a whole.\nAlthough it may at first just\nappear to be 'at least a step\nin the right direction' even\nif rather restricted' It\ncannot qualify even for this\nbecause the results will be\nuseless. It is short-sighted\nand narrow-minded and\nhas wasted our opportunity\nto tell the Board of Studies\nexactly what we need. Most\nstudents will obviously\nagree that there is room for\nimprovement in each of the\nabove categories in their\ncourse albeit with different\nimprovements in different\nplaces for different\ndepartments. But what will\nit mean in terms of action\nto be taken? Should the\ncourse be made less\ntheoretical? Should there\nbe fewer subject in the\nsyllabus? This is what\nwould be implied if the\nCollege is to adapt to the\nabove and it would\nseriously detract from the\nvalue of a degree from IC\nin the eyes of most\nemployers. Besides which it\nis simply not feasible to\nimplement such changes\ndue to the amount of\nadmins t ration( equals\nmoney) it would require.\nAnd it is not reasonable to\nask for such changes on\nthe basis a special sample\ngroup of students. Even if\nindividual departments took\nsteps to tackle these\nproblems, the effort would\nbe unjustified because by\ntheir nature the above are\nlocalised, transient\nproblems with a timescale\nof a few years or less. By\nthe time anything real\nbegan to happen, they\nwould be either completely\ndifferent or no longer there.\nSo, you may ask, having\ndisqualified what the\nPresident and the C& GAA O are doing about\nstudent needs, just what\nam I doing about it myself?\nMy answer is this\u2014I do not\nknow the answers, but I do\nknow the problem. The\nbest way to begin to tackle\nit is to try to make students\naware of it. There is an\nunderlying factor,\nconnected with all these\ncomplaints which will still\nbe there for years to come.\nWhilst we cannot say that\nin a few years' time the\nmost vociferous complaints\nwill still be in Maths 2, we\ncan say that there will\ndefinitely be somebody\nsomewhere who is very\ndiss at if i ed with his/her\ncourse, regretting ever\ntaking the subject (Know\nthe feeling?) The particular,\ndepartments are transient,\nirrelevant to the\nfundamental problem. After\nall, are we really going to\nsuge sts that the people\nwho run this college, who\nhave been addressing\nexactly these problems and\nvery many more for many\nyears and whose objectives\nis to achieve the maximum\nnumber of well-qualified\ngraduates, are that far out\nof touch with the students?\nAre the departmental\nstaff/students committees\nreally that useless? The\na nws ers is \"no' where, then\nis the problem? There is\nonly one other place to\nlook if it isn't them, it must\nbe us. It is the attitude of\nthe students that should\nchange.\nWe all arrive here like\nspoilt children and expect\neveryone around us to\nadapt to our specifications.\nWe are completely unable\nto look beyond are own\nlittle environs to the wider\ncontext of our situation as\nstudents of Imperial\nCollege, about to obtain a qualification that will label\nus for life. Imperial College\nis one of the best existing\nplaces for getting a good\nscientific/technical\neducation, respected\nthroughout the World for\nturning out capable people.\nWhile we are here, we\nshould be grateful for the\nopportunity take such a privilege. The academic\nstaff teach us or try to\nbecause they value there\nsubject, they value\nknowledge itself, and\nbecause they value the\naptitude that each of us has\nshown for our subject.\nInstead of appreciating this\nand helping with\nconstructive criticisms, we\njust take it all for granted\nand trust completely in a few people to represent us.\nUnfortunately they are all\nto often unable or unwilling\nto do so. We pick on\nsuperficial points about\nwhich to argue, in the\nvague hope that somebody\nsomewhere somehow can\njust flick a switch and solve\nit all.\nThe department of our\nCollege have only recently\nstarted using student\nquestion aires and trying to\nlisten out for what we have\nto say. Obviously we\nshould state the case as we\nsee it, but we should bear\nin mind that motives and\nobjectives of the\nstaff/student comit tes e, and\nsee things from a collective\npoint of view, the academic\nstaff and the students are\nequally vital organs of\nImperial College and we\nshould see ourselves as\npart of the same body in\nmany rep ect s. They are on\nour side: our real enemy is\nmutual and lies outside the\nCollege. Pete Klemperer\nBookshop\nNews\nOur annual book sale will\nbe held early in March it\nwill include diaries,\ncalender s and stationery\nitems. All will be reduced at\nleast 20%.\nIf you can't find the book\nyou require, don't be\nfrightened to ask,\nun fortuna tley there are\ntimes when lecture ers tell\nyou to buy a cet a in book\nbut haven't asked me to\nstock it.

And there's no telling\nwhat the OFFSTAGE bands are getting up to...).\nThe sheer size of the\norchestral forces involved\nindicate that this symphony\nis on an epic scale (as were\nmost of Mahler's works),\nand it is partly for this\nreason that it is seldom\nperformed. Aside from the\nindulgences in the brass\nsection, the woodwind are\ndoubled, the strings seem\nto spread to the walls of\nthe Great Hall, and the\nPercussion!\u2014Can such a collection of cymbals,\ndrums and two sets of\nTimpani be contained?\nAs if this wasn't enough\nto communicate with,\nMahler adds a soprano and\nalto so list, backed up by a large choir, just so no one\nfails to notice the fourth\nand fifth movements.\nWho, you may well be\nasking, is going to perform\nsuch an unbelievably\nextravagant and demanding\npiece anywhere, let alone\nat IC?\nImperial College\nSymphony Orchestra,\nunder the flamboyant\ndirection of Mr Richard\nDickins, their principal\nconductor. This is the\ngroup who brought you\nRachmaninov's2 nd Symphony last term,\nSchostokavich's5 th Symphony and, last year,\nStravinsky's 'Rite of Spring'.\nICSO has about seventy\nmembers who meet every\nWednesday for a gruelling\nthree-hour session, loosely\nknown as 'a rehearsal. The\nOrchestra's recent\nachievements testify to the\nhigh standard of playing\nand the enthusiasm with\nwhich the players tackle\never-more preposterous\nprogrammes, proposed by\ntheir conductor.\nMr Richard Dickins has\nbeen ' in charge' of ICSO\nfor seven years. He studied\nclarinet at the Royal\nCollege of Music (next\ndoor), changing to\nconducting, which he\nbegan with Norman Del\nMar. Since he left the\nCollege in 1979, Richard\nhas kept a busy schedule,\nsomehow managing to fit\nICSO rehearsals between\ndirecting the Covent\nGarden Chamber Orchestra\nand the Minehead Festival,\nRichard Dickins\nappearing at Edinburgh\nFestival and Sadler's Wells,\nand flitting across to La\nScala, Milan. But his most\nimportant appointment (at\nleast to us) is that he is\nnow 'musician in\nresidence'. He even has an\noffice! Any musicians or\ninterested students may\nfind him on Wednesday\nafternoons in 322, 53\nPrince's Gate.\nThat's enough about\nRichard, except to say that\nhe's pretty animated and\nshould be even more\ndynamic than usual for this\none!\nAlthough the majority of\nthe Symphony is purely\norchestral, the short fourth\nmovement and the epic\nfinale use solo voices and\nchoir. Our soprano soloist\nis Melanie Armitstead. She\nstudied singing at the\nGuildhall School of Music\nafter graduating from\nDurham with Russian and\nFrench. Since then, she has'\nworked with many\nem mine nt musicians\nincluding Sir Peter Pears,\nand has spent several\nsummers at the BrittenPears school for Advanced\nMusical study. Melanie has\ngiven recitals and\nperformed in Oratories\nthroughout the country,\nand was a finalist in the\n1984 'S Hertogenbosch\n.Melanie Armitstead\nInternational Singing\nCompetition.\nYvonne Howard is the\nalto soloist. She was\nawarded many prizes at the\nRoyal Northern College of\nMusic, and has done\nmasterclasses with Helen\nWatts and Elizabeth\nSchwarzkopf. As well as a soloist with orchestras and\nchoirs, Yvonne has also\ngiven acclaimed\nperformances on te\noperatic stage, singing\nMarcellina in Mozart's Marriage of Figaro' with\nGlyndebourne Touring\nOpera in 1984.\nThe choral forces are\nprovided by IC Choir, who\nhave undertaken to sing\nwith ICSO as well as\nperform their own concert\n(coming soon!).
