    "content": "22\n\u201cThere is some\noptimism in\nthe form of\nthe faith of\ngoodness in\nhuman nature\u201d\nH\nello, Felix\nR e a d e r !\nMy name is\nMatthew and\nI will be one of your\nthree film editors for the\ncoming year. I am first\nyear student, so still new\nto the university and\nI\u2019m really enjoying it so\nfar. My degree course\nis Physics with a Year\nAbroad, hoping to study\nsomewhere in France\n(where there\u2019s an especially good cinema scene)\nor Switzerland in my third\nyear.\nFilm is an eclectic\nform of artistic and\nexistential expression.\nIt is distinguished from\nsimilar media such as\nmusical theatre by its\nuniquely universal appeal\nand influence on popular\nculture. I have no particular requirements when it\ncomes to the silver screen:\nI think that one can almost\nalways tell a good picture\nwhen one sees it based\non a variety of factors,\nsuch as cinematography,\npacing, storyline and\ngeneral atmosphere.\nCertainly, I am partial to a\nfew blockbusters and I do\nnot support the view that\nthese are necessarily of a\nlower calibre. The following are a selection of my\nfavourite films which you\ndefinitely watch.\nUnforgiven\nThis unconventional early \u201890\u2019s Western may have featured\nand been directed by\nClint Eastwood, but it\nis markedly different in\nstyle and tone from the\nSpaghetti Westerns of\nthe 1960\u2019s directed by\nSergio Leone. The film\nfocuses less on the action,\ncomplex storylines and\nthe general glamorisa-tion of outlaw life in the\nWild West. Unforgiven\nexplores the darker side\nof \u2018cowboy\u2019 culture. Its\npacing is slow; depictions\nof violence are drawn-out and brutally realistic;\nthe mood of the film is\nsombre and heavy. In\na departure from Eastwood\u2019s much-played\nrole as a dashing young\ngunslinger, he plays an\nageing, widowed bandit\nrepentant of his younger\ndays. Accompanied by\nMorgan Freeman as his\nequally grizzled former\npartner, Gene Hackman\nas savagely sadistic\nsheriff ironically named\n\u2018Little Bill\u2019 and Richard\nHarris as the arrogant,\nUK-born gunfighter\n\u2018English Bob\u2019, it is hardly\nsurprising it won Oscars\nfor Best Picture, Director\nand Supporting Actor\n(Gene Hackman). Watch\nfor its masterful acting,\ncompelling storyline and\nthoughtful take on the\nhuman condition in the\nWild West.\n2001: A Space\nOdyssey\nIt would be hard to\nhave a list of favourite\npictures without one\ndirected by the indelible\nStanley Kubrick, widely\nconsidered to be one of, if\nnot the, greatest filmmakers of all time. For me,\nby Guillermo del Toro\nhas been described by\nthe man himself as the\nspiritual prequel to his\nlater magnum opus, Pan\u2019s\nLabyrinth. The film possesses some of the typical\ntraits of a del Toro pro-duction, such as an imag-inative, child-led narra-tive, a backdrop featuring\nwar and aspects of the\nsupernatural playing key\nroles. Overall, however,\nthis eerie, pared-down,\n(relatively) low-budget\nghost story has a distinctly different atmosphere\nto his larger, well-estab-lished blockbusters. I enjoyed watching this film\nfor its balance of gothic\nhorror and underlying\nsadness, well-handled by\ndel Toro through the hazy,\nhalf-understanding eyes\nof a child. Only available\nin Spanish with subtitles,\nit is worth seeing as an\nunconventional ghost tale\nless interested in obvious\nthrills.\nThe Godfather\nConsidered by many to\nthegreatestfilmofalltime,\nI love this picture from\nCoppola for its brilliant\ncombination of a highly\natmospheric soundtrack,\neffective acting and the\nrichness of its set pieces,\nnarratives and character\nprofiles. The three-hour\nlong piece of cinema takes\nthe viewer through every\ndimension: it has action,\nmeandering, panoramic\nframes, crime and cor-ruption, tension, drama,\ndeath, resolution \u2013 yet it\nnever feels overdone or\nbadly paced.The character\narcs are satisfying, and the\nstory gives a fascinating\ninsight into the world of\norganised crime in 1940s\nUSA, as well as inspiring\nreflection on the emptiness of violence and capturing the state of big-city\nculture at the time. Then\nthere\u2019s the Marlon Brando\nimpressions. A highly en-tertaining, essential film.\nLa Haine\nThis 1995 black-and-white French picture is\nunlikely to be something\nmost readers have seen\nbut gives a sobering\nglimpse into the menacing\nundertones of \u201890s French\nsociety. It is a piece of\nrealist cinema, shot almost\nlike a documentary, following an instrumental\n20 hours in the lives of\nthree recalcitrant, downtrodden French youths\nfrom immigrant families\nliving in the impoverished\nbanlieue of France. It is an\nimportant, if not depress-ing, work looking at the\nstandoff between police\nand violent, disillusioned\nmembers of the poorer,\nminority areas of France.\nDisparity between them\nand the rest of France\nand the ensuing hostility\nis examined, both in\nterms of wealth and perceived social class. The\ncharacters in this film,\ndesigned to resemble\nmany members of the\nFrench public, are shown\nto often lead completely\naimless lives, born in\nharsh surroundings,\nwithin an unknown wider\nworld where no-one\nseems to care about their\nstruggles and continued\nfailure seems inevitable,\nremoving any notion of\nmotivation and purpose.\nThere is some optimism\nin the form of the faith in\nthe goodness of human\nnature; a moment when\none of the characters\nis driven to commit a\nterrible crime but does\nnot. The opening line of\nthis feature, however, \u2018it\u2019s\nabout a society in freefall\u2019\nremains a beautifully\ntragic summary of its\nmain theme. Unfortunately, only the story is a work\nof fiction.\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFILM\nMatthew Leontsinis\nFilm Editor\nVincent Cassel in La Haine // Canal+\nOpen the pod day doors please, HAL/ /Warner Bros. Pictures\n\u201cIt would be\nhard to have\na list without\nKubrick\u201d\nalthough a slightly clich\u00e9d\npick, Space Odyssey is his\nmasterwork. Aside from\nits standalone excellence,\nKubrick introduces many\noriginal ideas in this work\nwhich have since gone on\nto revolutionise the Sci-Fi\ngenre which I particularly\nenjoyed. These include\nthe stark contrast between\nscenes with sweeping\nclassical scores such as the\niconic opening (Strauss\u2019\nAlso Sprach Zarathustra)\nand scenes filled only by\nsilence or ambient noise,\nas well the notion of AI\novertaking mankind.\nThe plot and themes are\ncomplex and fascinating\n\u2013 this is a film to watch\ntwice. It is a must-see for\nits tense, meticulously\ncrafted scenes, enthralling\n(if not unusual) cinematography and a greater\nunderstanding of Sci-Fi\npictures in general.\nThe Devil\u2019s Backbone\nThis little-known feature\n\n"

This was seen as\na reimplementation of\nthe previous Post-Study\nWork visa, which was\nscrapped by the then-Home Secretary Theresa\nMay back in 2012 in an\nattempt to bring down\nthe net migration figure,\nunder the background of\nthe infamous \u201cHostile\nEnvironment\u201d policy.\nSpeculation remained\nover the last few weeks\nas to whether this new\nvisa scheme could benefit\ncurrent students who\nhave already started their\ncourses before the scheme\nwas announced. Given the\nConservative party\u2019s track\nrecord on immigration\npolicies, the outlook was\nmostly negative.\nA twist came as the\ngovernment responded to\nan online petition titled\n\u201cBring the date for the\npost-study work visa\ncloser to help current\nstudents\u201d, which received\nmore than 26,000 signatures as of 11 October.\nThe response, issued by\nthe Home Office, states\nthat \u201c[a]ny student who\nsuccessfully completes\ntheir degree-level course\nat a qualifying institution\nin the summer of 2021 or\nthereafter will be eligible\nto apply\u201d. This means\nthat the year of entry will\nnot affect the eligibility\nfor this scheme, so long\nas the student completes\nthe course in or after\nsummer 2021. In practical\nterms, this would mostly\nbenefit 3-year Bachelor\nprogramme students who\nstarted after 2018, as well\nas4-yearintegratedMaster\nprogramme students who\nstarted after 2017. Those\nwho will finish before\nsummer 2021, however,\nare excluded from this\nscheme.\nWhile the 2-year\ngraduate visa will not\nrequire graduates to earn\nmore than a certain salary\nthreshold, graduates must\napply for the generic\nTier-2 work visa should\nthey wish to remain in\nthe UK after the 2-year\nperiod has elapsed.\nCurrent immigration\npolicies require people to\nearn more than \u00a330,000\nper year to be eligible for\nthis visa category, with\nsome limited exceptions.\nThis threshold is likely to\nincrease as the Tory-affiliated think tank Centre for\nSocial Justice has urged\nthe government to set the\nthreshold to \u00a336,700 per\nyear in a policy recommendation paper published in August. Policy\nrecommendations from\nCCJ have heavily influenced actual policies set\nout by the Conservative\nadministration in the past,\nincluding the introduction of the controversial\nUniversal Credit system.\nIt was widely speculated\nthat the government will\nlisten to this proposal.\nThe uncertainty\nremains as to whether the\ncurrent government can\nlast until 2021. Should the\nConservative party fail to\nform a government after\nthe imminent yet-to-be-called General Election,\nthe 2-year graduate visa\nscheme will not be implemented exactly as how it\nwas announced. However,\nalmost all the major opposition parties, including\nLabour and the Liberal\nDemocrats, are in favour\nof reforming the current\nimmigration policies\nestablished by Theresa\nMay\u2019s 9-year tenure as\nthe Home Secretary and\nthen the Prime Minister.\nLabour has consistently\nsupported UK graduates\u2019\nright to work and called\nfor the Tier-2 visa salary\nthreshold to be lowered.\nOn the other hand, since\nthe Brexit Party lead by\nNigel Farage has done\nconsistently well in recent\nopinion polls, it is not\nimpossible for the Conservative party to form a\nminority government with\nthe Brexit Party, in which\ncase the Brexit Party may\npress for a more hardline immigration policy\nto further reduce the net\nmigration figure.\nIt should be noted,\nhowever, that neither the\ngraduate visa scheme nor\nthe visa salary threshold\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.

We\nlearn, we change \u2013 all of\nus do, and a hell of a lot\nat that.\nIt's the first time most\nof us have been away\nfrom home. This means\ndifferent things for different people.\nFor some it\u2019s the chance\nto get away from pressures\nat home: the pressure to\nsucceed, perhaps, or the\npressure to adhere to a set\nof beliefs you don\u2019t actually subscribe to (for me,\nthis took the form of realising I don\u2019t actually care\nabout politics as much as\nI bloody should, which is\nnear-blasphemous in my\ndebate-heavy household).\nFor some it\u2019s the freedom\nto lie-in, stay up late, skip\nthe occasional lecture\n(bless Panopto, bless), or\nstop trying and failing to\nhide the fact that you \u2018socially smoke\u2019. For some\nit\u2019s the chance to reinvent\nthemselves (successfully\nor otherwise, cringily\nor otherwise) \u2013 to get\naway from a world where\neverybody remembers\nthat time you called the\nteacher \u2018mum\u2019 instead of\n\u2018Miss\u2019 and be cool, or be\nmore outgoing, or even\nto be more sensible and\ndisciplined than you were\nbefore.\nAs we go through our\ndegrees, the transitions\nremain in volume but\nchange in tone. They stop\nbeing about grand gestures and becomes more\nabout gradual understanding and self-introspection.\nIt becomes a process of\ncoming to terms with\nwhoever it is you ended\nup becoming after those\nbig shifts in lifestyle and\ncircumstance \u2013 someone\nthat can sometimes feel\nlike a stranger in the\nmirror. You stop forcing\nthe changes, stop experimenting with new things\nso much, and instead settle\ndown a little and start to\nfigure out what you like\nand don\u2019t like about this\nnew world you\u2019re in.\nYou figure out what it all\nmeans, man.\nIt\u2019s an incremental\nthing, understanding\nyourself. Nobody wakes\nup on the day they turn 18\nor 21 and feels any different than the day before \u2013\nsomething I found myself\na little disappointed about,\ndespite the obvious logic\nbehind it. But I realised\nthat I was a little more\ncomfortable with myself\nthan I had been a year\nbefore \u2013 or, if not com-fortable, then at least less\nbewildered and somewhat\nmore purposeful or directed in my evaluations of\nmy own life.\nOf course, this process\nimmediately repeats itself\nupon graduation \u2013 sud-denly, we\u2019re free. Sweet\nfreedom, the world is our\noyster, and so on and so\nforth. It\u2019s another new\nworld opening up before\nus. For some that\u2019s scary,\nwhile for others it\u2019s exhil-arating. Usually a little of\nboth, if we are honest with\nourselves.\nOne aspect of that Final\nTransitionTM is losing\nsome of our friends. That\u2019s\nsomething I wanted to talk\nabout, this issue, writing\non the night of graduation.\nFelix has been fortunate for the last few years\nto have an incredibly\nfun and highly dedicated\nteam. I\u2019ve talked about\nthis a little in previous ed-itorials. This is a group of\npeople who inspired me to\ntake up the legacy of the\nEditor-in-Chief position,\nand who I broadly look up\nto for various reasons.\nTonight, some of our\nalumni came back. A few\nare still kicking about Imperial \u2013 for some insane\nreason they decided to\ndo PhDs here, the poor\nblighters \u2013 but most have\ndeparted for pastures\nnew. From random conversation this evening, I\nknow that one has gone\nto the Netherlands, one\nto Canada, and another\nto Poland, while the rest\nhave scattered elsewhere\nlike dandelion puffs in the\nwind.\nGraduation is a special\nmoment, months after\ndeparture, when for one\nnight the last few years\ncrystallise into a clear-cut\nversion of themselves.\nIt is a glass night; easily\nshattered, fragile and\ntemporary, but beautifully\nrefracting the light of time\nwell spent (and time ill\nspent) over the unique\nexperience that is univer-sity. Friends of years are\nseen for the last time in a\nlong while, and memories\nand in-jokes doomed to\nbe forgotten are shared\none last time \u2013 usually\nover several pints, which\nmight partially explain the\n\u2018forgetting\u2019 part.\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s\nnecessarily how most\npeople celebrating this\nevening feel about it \u2013 but\nthat\u2019s how it appears from\nthe outside, observing\nas (Felix) cats tend to\ndo. It\u2019s easy to see the\nconnections forged\nduring late-night shifts\nin the office churning out\nhoroscopes for Hangman\n(or, towards the end of\nthe year, Master\u2019s degree\ntheses.) I\u2019m sure that\nevery group of laughing\nex-students at the Union\nhave equivalent memories\nand experiences \u2013 each of\nthem slowly fossilising\nin amber as an imperfect\nimage of good times as\nthe evening wears on.\nBut you know \u2013 the\nreally wonderful thing was\nhow they said hello and\njoked, after popping into\nthe office for a moment,\nwith the new members of\nthe team working with me\non this week\u2019s issue.\nThis meandering editorial is a last huzzah for\nthem \u2013 the Felix alumni,\ngone but not forgotten,\nand welcome to resurrect\nin the Felissy office any\ntime. May many a Colin\ncake lie in your future.\n(This is also a great way\nto see if they still bother to\nread the paper \u2013 especially\nthose doing PhDs here.)\nB\nAn homage to\nfriends old and\nnew: or, as it's\ncommonly known,\ngraduation blues\n2\n\n"

To\nease your concern we\u2019ve\ncreated our lists of top 5\nfilms with a little bit of\nsomething for everyone.\nFirst, cutting our favourite films down to a list\nof five is difficult. As in\nSophie\u2019s Choice difficult.\n(Although, spoiler, this\nfilm will not be making an\nappearance). Some films\nthat are close to our hearts\nhaven\u2019t made it into this\nspread, and if given the\nspace, I\u2019m almost certain\nwe could fill The Felix\nentirely, but that would be\na little too self-indulgent.\nWe\u2019d also like to add that\nthere is a big difference\nbetween our favourite\nfilms, and what we think\nis a good film; if we were\nto make a list of what\nwe believe are the 5 best\nfilms ever made, I don\u2019t\nthink there would be too\nmuch similarity between\nthese. With this sweeping\ndisclaimer as to avoid\nany angry emails from\nstudents professing their\nlove for Citizen Kane and\nVertigo, let\u2019s get into our\nfavourite 5\u2019s.\nTo begin I\u2019ll say a bit\nabout myself; I\u2019m a third-year physics student and\nspend most of my time\nbetween Blackett and the\nBFI. You can probably\ncatch me napping in the\nJCR between bouts of\nrestless frustration for\nlabs, and if you ever see\nme about campus, I\u2019m\nalways more than happy\nto talk anything film. Now\nonto the good stuff.\nTokyo Story\nWithout a doubt one\nof the most honest and\nheart-wrenching portrayals of a family that has\never existed on screen,\nTokyo Story has stood for\nover 65 years as a pillar\nin Japanese film making.\nFollowing two grandparents as they travel\nto Tokyo to visit their\ndisconnected children\nwho\u2019ve grown distant\nover the years, we\u2019re\nunapologetically taken\nthrough their time in the\ncity. Yasujir\u014d Ozu gives\nus a master class in sto-rytelling, which through\nhis minimalistic approach\nto shooting, we\u2019re left\nwith the bare bones of the\ndialogue with the actors\ntaking the centre stage.\nWhere a lesser film would\nhave played heavily on\nour sentimental triggers\ncreating melodrama,\nTokyo Story instead gives\nus a sincere and honest\nfilm that lets the weight\nof the character\u2019s actions\nhang heavily over the\nviewer. It\u2019ll make you\nreconsider your family\nvalues and, in the process,\nleave you weeping, this\nemotional feature had to\nmake it onto my list\nRushmore\nRushmore is just a film\nthat hits all the right notes\nfor me; it\u2019s brilliantly\nwritten, quietly funny,\nand with a soundtrack\nto please even the Music\nstill carefully crafted,\nit\u2019s a little more rugged\naround the edges than the\nlikes of Grand Budapest\nand Moonrise, and with\nthe perfectly imperfect\nSchwartzman and Murray\nleading the cast, I\u2019ll be the\nfirst student enrolling at\nRushmore next year.\nLady Bird\nIt would have been\ndifficult to make to the\nend of 2017 without\nhaving had Lady Bird\nmentioned to you, along\nwith the eminent buzz\naround Greta Gerwig. For\nher solo directorial debut,\nGerwig tells the coming-of-age story of Christine\nMcPherson (Saoirse\nRonan) growing up in\nSacramento, and follows\nthe uneven relationship\nwith her mother (Laurie\nMetcalf). The centrepiece\nof this film for me are\nthe highly observant\nand expertly written\ninteractions between the\npeople, creating one of\nthe most heart-warming\nand poignant films of\nthe 21st century. With a\npowerhouse performance\nfrom Metcalf mixed with\nan eclectic score (that car\nscene bowls me over every\ntime) and not to mention\nthe final scene (which is\none of the most touching\nand accurate portrayals of\nnostalgia I\u2019ve ever seen)\nthis is a film that sits close\nto my heart.\nMidnight in Paris\nNow I know Woody\nAllen has a plethora of\nfilms to choose from;\nAnnie Hall, Love and\nDeath,Manhattantoname\na few, but none of these\nfilms quite grip me like\nMidnight in Paris. With\nOwen Wilson roaming\nthe streets of 1920\u2019s Paris,\ndoing his best Woody\nAllen impression, I can\u2019t\nhelp but get lost in the\nsame world that he finds\nhimself in every night.\nTaken from Hemingway\u2019s\nA Moveable Feast, the\nfairy tale portion of this\nstory lends itself to brilliant writing (as can be\nexpected of Allen) with\nthe likes of Fitzgerald\nand Stein being brought\nback to life. This fairy tale\nworld makes me long for\na time I never knew, and a\nplace I\u2019ve never been, and\nfor that it will always be\none of my favourite films.\nBirdman or (The\nUnexpected Virtue of\nIgnorance)\nAlejandro Gonzalez\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu knows how to\nmake a film. His vision\nfor a feature made to\nlook as though it\u2019s in\none take is flawlessly\nexecuted and exceedingly\nimmersive, whilst still\ngrounding itself with an\noutstanding story.

    "content": "Meet the Editors: Ozbil - The Fanatical One\nH\naving joined\nFelix Arts as\na writer last\nyear, I often\nthink about how different\nlife would have been had\nI joined sooner. I first\nheard about Felix Arts\nfrom my housemate,\nand quickly realised that\nthis would be one of the\nbest ways to enjoy the\nLondon theatre scene on\na student budget \u2013 and\nenjoy it I have! Having a\nan endless source of free\npress tickets allowed me\nto see productions that\nI wouldn\u2019t otherwise be\nable to afford. Now a fifth\nyear medical student, I\nhave found myself not\nonly writing for, but also\nediting th Arts section of\nFelix.\nAs you might have\nguessed already, I tend\nto be more interested in\nthe performaning arts.\nI\u2019ve seen Hamilton four\ntimes (twice for free,\nthanks to kind strangers\non Twitter!!!) and Harry\nPotter and the Cursed\nChild five times (I may\nhave found a way to rig\ntheir lottery, which sadly, I\ncan no longer do). I loved\nWar Horse so much that I\nwent again with a friend\nthe day after seeing it for\nthe first time with another\nfriend. I even met Sara\nBareilles on the opening\nnight of Waitress, which,\nfrankly, made my life.\nMy involvement in\ndrama started at a young\nage, taking part in various\nschool productions. My\ninitial acting career was\ncut short when I started a\nshort-lived experiment in\nplaying the trumpet. This\ndidn\u2019t last long.\nMy mum and I have\nalways had a tradition\nwhen I was growing up.\nEvery September, my\nmum and I would buy\ntickets for the Cyprus\nInternational Theatre\nFestival and go see every\nsingle play available for\nthe entire month. We\nmanaged to keep this up\nuntil I left for university,\nand even after when my\nbrother took on my role,\nand I lived vicariously\nthrough them.\nOnce I came to\nImperial, the flame I once\nhad for acting was reignit-ed after I auditioned to be\na part of the ICSM Drama\nproduction of You Can\u2019t\nTake It With You, where\nI played the role of the\nRussian ballet instructor.\nWhat a blast! Ever since\nthen, I have been an active\npart of the ICSM Drama\nfamily and have enjoyed\nevery second of it.\nIn short, the theatre\nscene in London has been\na defining part of my\nuniversity life, and it was\nsurprisingly affordable.\nCome join us at Felix\nArts if that sounds like\nsomething you\u2019re interested in. We\u2019re to be found\nat Felix Arts 2019/20\non Facebook (Felix Arts\n2019/20), or you can\nemail us at arts.felix@\nic.ac.uk.\nNoises Off\nH\nailed as \u2018iconic\u2019\nand as \u2018the\nfunniest farce\never written\u2019, I\nthought I was in for a treat\nwhen I went to see Noises\nOff at the Garrick Theatre.\nHaving been revived on\nBroadway various times,\nI was sure that the play\nwould be nothing short of\nmagnificent. Oh, boy, was\nI wrong.\nNoises Off is pretty\nmuch one of the earlier\nexamples of a play-with-in-a-play. Divided into\nthree acts, the first act focuses on the technical rehearsal (the night before\nthe official opening), the\nsecond act on the opening\nnight, and the final act on\nthe closing night, months\ndown the line, displaying\nthe sheer incompetence\nof both cast and crew in a\nfictional play called Nothing On. The Noises Off\naudience gets to watch the\nevents unfold both from\nwhere the Nothing On audience would be sat and\nfrom the backstage at different points in the show.\nOverall the cast is very\nstrong. There isn\u2019t too\nmuch acting involved, as\nthe play relies heavily on\nphysical comedy, but what\nacting there is is done really well. Where the cast\nreally deserves credit is\nthe incredible precision of\ntheir movement throughout the play, shutting and\nopening doors at exactly the right moments ,\nthrowing props around\nand moving through the\nprecise choreography required for the show to\nwork at all.\nUnfortunately, while\nimpressive, the physical\ncomedy just isn\u2019t funny.\nWhat I thought would be\na laugh-out-loud evening\nconsisted of maybe a few\ngiggles. Some members\nof the audience seemed\nto really enjoy it - sadly,I\nfound their unrestrained\nhilarity funnier than what\nwas on stage. I might have\ngiven the show a pass had\nit contained any deeper\nmessage behind the unsuccessful hilarity, but unfortunately it was entirely\ndevoid of one.\nWhile I really don\u2019t\nlike the term \u2018cringeworthy\u2019, I can\u2019t think of any\nother way to describe the\nplay, as the humour was\nextremely cheap through-out. I get the attempts by\nthe play trying to symbolise life itself and how\nit is often a bigger mess\nthan anticipated, but as\nan audience member, it is\nonly possible to come to\nthis conclusion if you are\nforcing yourself to come\nto a conclusion. Overall,\nalthough a completely\nharmless bit of staging,\nNoises Off fails to deliver either the promised\nlaughs or a point to the\ngauche buffoonery.\nOzbil Domenci\nArts Editor\nA budding thespian trying out his blue steel\n// The Crucible, ICSM Drama\nISSUE 1730\nFELIX\n11\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\n\u201c...I played\nthe role of the\nRussian ballet\ninstructor.\nWhat a blast!\u201d\nARTS\nOzbil Domenci\nArts Editor\nWhere?

The crisp weather\nseemed to reflect the\nnerves amongst the fresh-ers, while the autumnal\nsunshine mirrored the excitement within the team.\nThe first 10 minutes saw\nImperial forwards attacking the try line with pick\nand gos. After a series of\nrelentless phases, their efforts were not rewarded as\nthe referee (who seemed\nto not be on form that day)\nclaimed the ball was held\nup. Moments after, from a\nturnover, Amin\u2019s piercing\nball to Duffy, on the verge\nof being intercepted, saw\nhim get the opening 5\npoints as he went on to\nbeat 3 other defenders.\nEarly in the second\nhalf, the dominant KCL\nscrum near the Imperial\ntry line led to the number\n8 walking the ball over;\n7-5 KCL.\nA dispirited drizzle\nensued and Imperial\nwere down to 10 men.\nShortly after, with the\ndisappearance of the rain,\na small pop pass, as if the\nball were a pea popping\nout of its pod, from Dan\nKirrane to Oliver Duffy\nin the middle of the pitch\nsaw Duffy score his\nsecond for the day; 7-12\nImperial. The boys fought\nfor another try to put\naway the game. Lustreless\nphases of unimaginative\nKCL attack was met with\na web-like defensive\nstructure the team had\nworked hard on; both the\nline speed and the aggression in the tackles proved\nto be too much for KCL\nas they struggled to keep\npossession. In the blink of\nan eye, Dan Kirrane was\noff and running for the try\nline as he scooped up the\nball rolling out of a ruck\ngoing on to side step the\nback three; 7-19 Imperial.\nWith minutes left, KCL\nwere unable to get back\nin the game. In the end,\nmoments of brilliance\nfrom the Imperial backs\nand a gallant defensive\neffort from the forwards\nwere enough to get the\nfirst win of the season. In\nparticular, the accuracy of\nthe 5 lineout maestros in\ncatching darts from Toby\nDaniels must commend-ed.\nV\nalerio fielded\nan experienced\nXV to face\nMedway, with\njust three freshers making\nthe cut and multiple familiar faces returning to\nthe side after last years\u2019\nsabbatical. We knew\nwe were in for a tough\ngame against last years\u2019\nleague winners, who beat\nus both home and away\nlast season. They were\nconsiderably bigger than\nus, but we knew that if we\napplied the structure that\nwe\u2019d been working on in\nMonday evening sessions,\nwe had the potential to\ntear them apart.\nRudman took the\nkick off well and carried\nhard, setting up a strong\nplatform for George\nMorgan to box kick.\nRelentless defence from\nthe home side followed,\nputting Medway on the\nback foot. After a turnover\nfrom Charles Courougeux, sustained attack\nmeant the visitors eventually lost their discipline,\nenabling Thornton to go\nquickly and score the first\nfive points of the match.\nSimon Thorntorn\nIC Rugby member\n22 5\nImperial\n2nd XV\nMedway\n1st XV\nV\nFreshers recruitment // IC Rugby\nSPORTS\nSean Nakai\nIC Rugby member\n7 19\nKCL 1st\nXV\nImperial\n1st XV\nV\ntheir strength lied; the\npick-and-go. They successfully did this from\ntheir own 22 to score their\nfirst points of the match.\nThe conversion meant the\nscore was 10-7 in favour\nof the home side.\nWith less than 10\nminutes to go and Imperials defence proving\nimpenetrable, Medway\nknew that they had to try\nand be a bit more creative.\nThis resulted in them\nattempting to go wide, but\nCharles\u2019 intuition meant\nhe read the play perfectly,\nintercepting a wide pass\nand running in for Imperial\u2019s third try.\nWith the game seemingly over, Imperial were\nhungry to chase that fourth\ntry to secure a bonus point\nwhich may prove vital\nin their title contention.\nWith Marco and Shuya\non the pitch, you\u2019re never\nlacking in flair, and this is\nexactly what was required\nwhen they combined with\nfresher Peter to see Marco\nscore under the posts,\nconverted by Valerio.\nThe 2nd XV have a lot\nto be proud of after that\nperformance against a\nstrong Medway side and\nit\u2019s looking good for the\nrest of the season. Nevertheless there\u2019s a lot to\nwork on as we should\u2019ve\nshut them out in the first\nhalf.\nSpecial shout-out to\nBrzosko for filling in at\nprop after Matias flaked\nbecause he can\u2019t hack a\nhangover.\nP.S.

    "content": "ASoviet still life in eight chapters - Theatre of Nations\nT\nhe themes of\nthe stories are\ncentred mostly\non the everyday\naspects of social life.\nThe characters are not\nextraordinary in their\nfeats of achievement but\nshine through with their\ntouching realness. When\nthe curtains part, a bench\nis revealed, which takes\nup most of the stage, and\nwill throughout serve\nas several metaphorical\nspaces, testing the ability\nof actors to convince us\nof their characters. This\nthey do brilliantly. Behind\nthe bench are three large\npicture panels. In the\nthe first play they show\nbeautiful sunflowers in\nsummer sunshine, while\nin the last the flowers\nappear withered. These\npanels, along with the\ncostumes, are the only\nvisual context given to the\nstories. These are mostly\nconcerned with life in the\ncountryside or at the intersection of rural and urban\nlife \u2013 and the associated\nchallenges common to this\njuxtaposition characteristic of newly industrialized\nnations.\nThe first story is\nopened by the narration\nof two cheery but blunt\nvillage ladies, sitting\non one corner of the\nhumongous bench and\nshedding sunflower seeds\nall over the floor. Their\ndemeanour and tone give\nthe immediate impression\nof a gossiping babushka,\nall too known to me as a\nfellow Slav from a small\ntown. The wholesome\nstory gives a glimpse\nof the cyclical nature of\nlife especially evident in\nslow-paced rural areas,\nand comments on the\nillusive nature of the\ngeneration gap. As a son\nasks his father for help\nin the courtship of a love\ninterest the awkwardness\nis palpable, the acting\nbrilliant, and there are the\nconstant shouts of advice\nfrom a grandad drunk off\nvodka. How lovely!\nWhile some stories are\nquite placid, others have\nmore of an agenda. The\nsecond half of the three-hour performance kicked\noff with a story of a man\nmadly in love getting his\nheart broken by a wife that\neveryone else had seen for\na twisted seductress. It\nraises the question of the\npoint of disillusionment,\nand answers it with the\nprotagonist\u2019s declaration\nto the effect of: \u201cThis is a\nmighty hangover\u2026 But it\nwas a hell of a party.\u201d\nThere is another story\nof a man of country blood\nmarrying a Muscovite,\ngoing through a turbulent\nsequence of moments of\ninfectious love-happiness\nand utter despair, before\nlosing his mind, threatening to kill his wife,\nand finally committing\nsuicide. It is a Russian\nspecialty to drive chinks\nin characters\u2019 psyches\nfrom utter banality to the\nrawest human emotions,\nand Shukshin does it\nbrilliantly.\nMy favourite one,\nthough, is of the blind\naccordion player, who\nonly sang sad songs. With\nthe advent of broadcasting\ntechnology, the city noises\nbegan to drown him out,\nand the state eventually\noffered him a pension\nin order to stop him\nbumming everyone out\nwith his singing. When at\nthe end, a possible conclusion is offered by some\nteenagers wanting to\narchive old folk songs and\ngrant him new purpose,\nit is snatched away by\nthe sad fact that all the\nsongs the man can sing\nhad already long been\nrecorded and archived. It\nis a comment on the role\nof the artist, his need for\nan audience, and how\ntechnology, a totalitarian\nregime\u2019s strong hand, and\nmost importantly, time,\ncan all combine to make\nhis art irrelevant. But,\nas Bulgakov said, manuscripts don\u2019t burn, and\nthe touching stories of\nShukshin continue to hold\ngreat power even today.\nLive it up with the Modernist\u2019s at Barbican\u2019s new show\nI\nn contrast to last\nyear\u2019s wildly popular\nModern Couples,\nwhich offered an\nintimate view into how interpersonal relationships\nof artists shaped their\nwork, this offers a different view. It portrays some\nof the most influential\nartists of modernism as\nentertainers: uproarious\nand devilish founders of\nthe most vibrant creative\nspaces of their time.\nThe exhibit is divided\ngeographically, and each\nroom shows off a different city\u2019s cabaret scene. It\nstarts off with the Fledermaus in Vienna. The level\nof detail shown by both\nthe curators of the exhibit and the original cabaret\nfounders is breath-taking.\nYou can observe the menus and napkins, chairs and\ntables, wall tapestries and\ncarpets \u2013 all of them carefully designed to create a\nholistic space. The main\nroom is one of the four\ncabaret spaces recreated\nfor this exhibition, allowing us to immerse in it and\neven touch the tiles adorning the walls. The enchanting room, converted\nfrom the basement of a\nresidential building by the\naddition of a mosaic of\ncoloured tiles and a mir-ror-topped bar, was unfortunately only in operation\nfor six years due to costing so much money. Despite this, the presence of\na drawing of the room by\na young Charles-Edouard\nJeanneret, apparently the\nonly drawing of Viennese\narchitecture that the future\nLe Corbusier would ever\nmake, is a testament to its\ninfluence.\nBoundary-pushing\nhappenings, dance per-formances, shadow plays,\nearly cinema and dances\nmingled in their nascency\nin all these spaces. This effort to provide all kinds of\nsensory experience is why\nit is hard to compare these\noriginal night-dwellings\nof the avant-garde to the\nspawns of the multibil-lion-pound clubbing industry today. The clubs of\nthe past were much more\nspaces of creative proliferation than hedonism,\nalthough both aspects can\nbe observed in the evidence put forth by the ex-hibition. It is also true that\nthese places, beginning\nwith the first of them all,\nParis\u2019s Le Chat Noir, were\nmostly frequented by the\nartistic elite. The insufficiency of such clientele\ncould explain their short\nlifespans and the quickly\nchanging fads, a problem\neven for the clubs of to-day.\nThe biggest feat of this\nexhibit is the way it unwittingly takes you on a\njourney through the most\nimportant artistic movements of the time. We are\ninspired by the most well-known, as well as some\nlesser known cabarets and\nclubs Both places where\ndesign was king and where\nthe people were the soul.\nWe pass by the Italian Futurists, and their Cabaret\ndel Diavolo, where three\nrooms were inspired by\nheaven, purgatory, and\nhell of Dante\u2019s Divine\nComedy.

The quote\nby Nigerian artist Twins\nSeven-Seven sums it up\nnicely: \u201cWe worked furiously (\u2026) slept little and\nlived for the daily surprises\u2026 For such a euphoric\nsituation to develop the\ntime, the place and the\nhuman chemistry need to\nbe right!\u201d\nISSUE 1730\nFELIX\n17\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMartin Flerin\nArts Writer\nWhere?

We are left\nto wander through the\npalace\u2019s rooms, tasked\nwith finding out just what\nis going on.\nSuch is the premise\nof Shotgun Carousel\u2019s\nimmersive theatre perfor-mance, Red Palace. It\u2019s\ntheir latest large performance since last year\u2019s\nwell-received Divine\nProportions. While that\nwas centred around a\ndining experience, this\nyear they\u2019ve decided to\nmake it more accessible\nwith a performance-only\noption. I think this is a\ngood idea, dinner being\na luxurious touch but not\nessential to understanding\nthe performance. The\nmenu, put together by\nMasterchef semi-finalist\nAnnie McKenzie, was delicious and appropriately\nbanquet-y - think smoky\nslow-cooked lamb, melty\nCamembert and toffee\napples in poison green.\nSome staffing issues had\nthe show starting late so\nalas, we didn\u2019t quite have\ntime for dessert before\nbeing whisked off to the\nmain performance - a real\nshame.\nWe were given four\nchimes of the bell to\n\u2018explore the palace\u2019. It\ntranspired that there were\nfour different rooms, and\nwe needed to go into each\nof them to find out the\nfull story. It\u2019s a pity this\nwasn\u2019t made clear from\nthe start \u2013 some people\nflitted in and out of rooms,\nor stopped for a cocktail\nand thereby missed a\nquarter of the plot.\nThe four sets were the\nbest part of the show, each\nbeing their own self-con-tained world. There was\na bath-house dripping\nwith water and littered\nwith seashells, where\na seaweed-encrusted\nmermaid sang to us in a\nsiren\u2019s voice. A chintzy,\ntapestry-draped room\nwhere we had our fortunes\ntold. An eerie forest where\nwolves howled under the\nfull moon. And finally, a\nlittle underground dive\nwith candlelit tables and a\nstriptease act.\nImmersive theatre\nalways requires a fine\nbalance between storytelling and audience\ninteraction. I\u2019m not sure if\nShotgun Carousel had the\nbalance quite right. My\nfellow-ballgoer was asked\nto pass a message from\none character to another,\nbut the character he gave\nit to seemed nonplussed.\nUnlike full-on immersive\nshows like Wolf of Wall\nStreet, the exploration and\ninteraction here was more\nlimited - we essentially\nwent into the four rooms\nfor a piece of the plot in\neach one.\nAfter all the buildup,\nthe ending turned out\nto be rather brief and\nanticlimatic. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s\n\u201cRun The World (Girls)\u201d\nstarted blaring from the\nspeakers along with other\nfemale-centric anthems in\na bizarre feminist twist.\nThis was strange to say\nthe least as there hadn\u2019t\nbeen so much as a whiff of\nfeminist rhetoric till then.\nNonetheless, Red\nPalace made for an\nentertaining and unusual\nevening. The atmosphere\nwas certainly magical,\nwith everyone donning\nmasks and many attendees in extravagant gothic\ncostume.Despiteaslightly\nput-together feel (terrible\nbartenders, sets relying\nheavily on draped fabric),\nstrong performances by\nthe actors carried the\nday. Steffi Walker was\nparticularly memorable as\nThe Mermaid, delivering\na haunting mix of cruelty\nand charm. On the whole,\nRed Palace had great\npotential for a thrilling\nnight out. I would just\nhave loved to see it with\na tighter plot and more\nspace for exploration.\nUp Pompeii - an audio revival\nO\nne quick look\naround the\naudience and\nI soon realise\nmy companion and I are\neasily the youngest in the\nroom. I\u2019m also the only\nnon-white person there\n(unless we\u2019re counting\nthe ushers). We\u2019re at a\nlive radio recording of\nUp Pompeii, that BBC\ncomedy classic about a\nne\u2019er-do-well slave in\nAncient Rome and the\ncaprices of the family he\nworks for. Not heard of it\nbefore? Understandable,\ngiven that it was first\nreleased in 1969 \u2013 long\nbefore many of the readers of Felix were born.\nBack in its heyday the\nsitcom attracted up to 12\nmillion viewers. Much\nof its appeal came from\nthe idiosyncratic comedian Frankie Howerd, who\nplayed the title role of\nslave Lurcio. Yes, Lurcio, as in \u2018he-who-lurks\u2019.\nIt\u2019s all about the cheeky\nfaux-Latin names here,\nand there\u2019s a full household of them \u2013 the bumbling master Ludicrus\nSextus, his promiscuous\nwife Ammonia, their ridiculously na\u00efve son Nausius and their not-so-inno-cent daughter Erotica.\nThe cast for this 50th\nanniversary revival is\nbrilliant. Knowing how\nmuch the original depended on Howerd\u2019s unique\ncharm, producer Barnaby\nEaton-Jones has gotten\nDavid Benson, known for\nhis skills at mimicry, to\nimpersonate him as perfectly as possible. Benson\nhas Howerd\u2019s frequent\naudience asides, curious\nlittle tics, and eccentric\ncatchphrases down pat.\nAs audiences, we\u2019re admonished for laughing\n\u2013 \u2018Shut your face!\u2019, \u2018Oh,\nplease yourselves\u2019 \u2013 by\nLurcio, which of course\nonly makes us laugh\nmore. There\u2019s comedy\nlegend Tim Brooke-Taylor as baddie Captain\nTreacherus, who rampages around looking for\nhis escaped galley slave\nVoluptua (played very\ncoquettishly by Camille\nCoduri, of Doctor Who\nfame). It\u2019s a star-studded\ncast and every character\nis played just how you\nwould imagine them to\nbe \u2013 the lecherous husband terrified of his wife,\nthe teenage boy desperate\nto lose his virginity, the\nman-eating nymphomaniac\u2026\nWait, the what? I know,\nI know. Fifty years on,\nthe main problem with\nUp Pompeii is that the\ncharacter clich\u00e9s it relied so heavily on are increasingly less relevant in\nthe modern age. Another\ncore part of its humour is\nbawdiness; the script is\nchock full of intentionally\nbad puns double-entren-dres, with many a nudge-and-wink at the audience.\nIt\u2019s very farcical and pan-to-y, the audience love it\nbut for me it gets old quite\nquickly (pun not intended,\nha-ha). There\u2019s a sense\nthat the cast could be doing much better comedy\nwere they not constrained\nby the script; the funniest\nbits are when something\ngoes wrong and they ad-lib.\nIt\u2019s a fascinating window into the humour of\ntwo generations ago.

If her vision for\nthis novel was to deliver\na powerful story, she has\nexecuted it \ufb02awlessly.\nThe summary does little\njustice to the engrossing,\nemotional tale. It\u2019s best\nto dive into a story as\nsuch knowing as little as\npossible.

One particularly\ncontroversial aspect of\nthe deal was the repealing\nof some 40-year-old fuel\nsubsidies, which saw the\nprice of diesel double\novernight. In response,\nlabour unions and indigenous groups took to\nthe streets to demand the\nsubsidies\u2019 reinstatement \u2013\ninitially, Moreno refused\nto budge, and so the protests became increasingly\nviolent, culminating in\nhostage-taking of police\nofficers, the deaths of\nat least 8 people, and\nevacuation of the national\ngovernment from Quito\nto the coastal city of\nGuayaquil. After 2 weeks\nof continuous unrest and\neventual talks, Moreno\nfinally agreed to reinstate\nthe subsidies. A victory\nfor the people, then \u2013 but\nwhat lurks beneath the\nsurface?\nMoreno had been right\nto be nervous: over the\npast 30 years, indige-nous-led groups have been\nresponsible for the ousting\nof several presidents.\nDespite this, the government maintained that the\npackage was necessary to\nmake up for years of overspending by the previous\ngovernment of Rafael\nCorrea. They said that the\nsubsidies were costing the\nnation a cool $1.4bn per\nyear, a sum which had\nbecome unaffordable. For\nCONAIE (Confederation\nof Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador) however,\nthis wasn\u2019t good enough.\nthe doubling of fuel costs\nimpacts disadvantaged\npeople massively.\nAll of this points to\na substantial failing of\nleft-wing Latin American\npolitics. Native peoples\nhave for years struggled\nunder the yoke of global\nneoliberalism; their lands\nare frequently occupied\nby multinational corporations and their traditional\nsocieties are disrupted by\nan uncaring global order.\nFor the approximately 3\nmillion indigenous Ecuadoreans, this means being\n4.5 times more likely to\nbe impoverished. Native\nchildren only stay in\nschool on average for half\nas long as their coloni-al-descended classmates.\nAnd yet despite this\nobvious systemic disad-vantage, many left-wing\npopulists of the Latin\nAmerican \u201cpink tide\u201d\nhave been unable to adequately deal with it. Take\nCorrea: over the course of\nhis 10-year premiership,\nhis government used state\noil revenues to increase\nspending on health,\neducation and social\nprograms, and as a result\n\u201cA substantial\nfailing of left-wing Latin\nAmerican\npolitics\u201d\nEcuador saw a large drop\nin poverty and inequality,\namong other encouraging\ndevelopment indicators.\nHowever, his administration oversaw intense development and exploitation of natural resources\nand native lands, often on\nbehalf of overseas com-Thousands massed outside National Assembly building in Quito // Reuters\n\u201cFor the\napproximately\n3 million\nindeginous\nEcuadoreans,\nthis means\nbeing 4.5\ntimes more\nlikely to be\nimpoverished\u201d\npanies. In late 2016, the\nlands of the Shuar people\nin the Amazon were literally invaded and occupied\nby the state military\nin response to their\nopposition to massive\nhydroelectric and mining\ndevelopments by Chinese\nand Canadian firms. The\nlocal autonomous government was arbitrarily\ndetained, and when the\nlocals attempted to resist,\nthe army were granted\nexceptional powers to put\nthem down.\nThe response from\nsupporters of Correa\u2019s\napproach will say that the\ndevelopment provided\nover a billion dollars in\nincome for the government annually, money\nwhich was then reinvested\ninto the country for the\nbenefit of all. But much\nof this reinvestment was\nonly skin deep, and failed\nto properly address the\ndeeper structural roots\nof inequality in Ecuador,\nwhich come as the product\nof decades of colonial and\npost-colonial historical\ndevelopment \u2013 a development whose characteristics are specifically Latin,\nand whose antagonisms\nare rooted in the tension\nbetween the European\nand the Indigenous. This\nfailure is evident in the\nover-reliance of Correa\u2019s\neconomic plans on global\ncommodity prices, most\nparticularly oil. His\nvolatile, populist leftism,\nwhile impressive in the\nshort term, can never truly\nreconcile the inequalities\nof Ecuador because it\nrelies too inherently on\nEuropean notions of indi-vidualism, which stand in\nstark contrast to traditional\nnative ways of life. For the\nLatin American left, then,\na new way of thinking is\nneeded, and seeds of it\ncan be found in the works\nof the Peruvian thinker\nJose Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui.\nIn the early 20th Century,\nMari\u00e1tegui saw that\napplying European ideas\nabout leftism to South\nAmerica was foolish, both\nsince the continents had\nundergone such different\ndevelopments through\nhistory, and since the\ngerms of socialist society\npre-existed in many\nindigenous peoples of the\nregion. This is the kind of\nradical thinking necessary\nfor the reinvigoration of\nthe Latin leftist project -one needs only to look to\nthe Zapatistas of Chiapas\nto see the successes it\ncan produce. It\u2019s also one\nthat\u2019s particularly relevant\nconsidering the current\nclimate crisis: in the words\nof the Peruvian indigenous leader Hugo Blanco,\n\u201cWe Indians, we\u2019ve been\npracticing ecosocialism\nfor five centuries now\u201d.\n\u201cThe deeper\nstructural roots\nof inequality...\nthe product\nof decades of\ncolonial and\npost-colonial\nhistorical\ndevelopment\u201d\nWith all this in mind,\nwe can understand\nthe current protests in\nEcuador as but one facet\nof a long struggle between\nindigenous and colonial\nthought in Latin America.\nThough the current\nprotests have ended, the\nunderlying tension isn\u2019t\ngoing anywhere. Moreno\nmust understand this\nbetter than his predecessors if he is to truly move\nEcuador forwards.\nLed by Jaime Vargas,\nthey maintained that the\nsubsidies are vital for the\nlivelihoods of the poor, of\nwhom indigenous people\nform a disproportionate\npart. In a country where\nthe minimum wage is\nunder $400 per month,\n\n"

Prior to this\ntime last year, only one\nman had run under 2:03\nin a record-eligible city\nmarathon, and he (Dennis\nKimetto) has since transitioned into insignificance\nas if trying to avoid\nsomething. Enter Eliud\nKipchoge. This man has\nwon 11 out of the 12 extremely competitive city\nmarathons he has started,\nincluding four London\nMarathons (essentially\nthe running equivalent of\nWimbledon Tennis - it is\nreputationally and financially the top prize in the\nsport). Even Kipchoge\ncould not break 2:03 until\n2017. And in the space\nof just a couple of years,\nover 3 minutes has been\nwiped off what people\nbelieve is achievable in a\nmarathon distance event.\nThat is equivalent to Bolt\nrunning 9.32 seconds for\n100 metres, or Hicham El\nGuerrouj running an unthinkable 3:20 for 1500m.\nSo, what are these\nspecialconditions?Firstly,\nyou have the pacing,\nwhich was provided by 41\nrotating pacemakers and\na car mounted green laser\nindicating 2-hour pace.\nWhile in cycling, one can\nexpect to save around\na third in power output\nby \u2018drafting\u2019 and taking\nadvantage of aerodynamic\nblockage, this effect is\nmuch smaller at running\npace because of the cubic\neffect of speed on power.\nIt is likely that the majority\nof the benefit of drafting\ncomes from the psychological benefit of not\nhaving to pace every step,\nbut rather deferring that\ntask to another. Secondly,\nthe date, time and course\nwere all selected to\noptimise the suitability\nof the event for marathon\nrunning. Kipchoge had\nperfect weather, no hills\n(6 metres gained overall)\nand only 8 sweeping\nturns. Add to this that he\nhad bottles handed to him,\nand Kipchoge had the\nperfect conditions to crush\nan optimal marathon. But\nstill, to my mind, this does\nnot explain this feat.\nThe third and final\nfactor, sadly, is the shoes.\nSadly because Nike does\nhave, and has had for quite\nsome time, a monopoly on\nshoes that almost certainly aid marathon running.\nThe first piece of evidence\nfor this is a NYT article\nthat used 500,000 runners\u2019\nStrava data to show a 4%\nbenefit from switching\nto Nike Vaporfly 4%\nshoes. Secondly, Kipchoge\u2019s (and other notable\nNike athletes\u2019) recent\nimprovement in times.\nThirdly, on the day I write\nthis, Brigid Kosgei has\nOBLITERATED Paula\nRadcliffe\u2019s \u2018unbreakable\u2019\n2:15:25 that has stood\nfor 16 years by running a\nstupendous 2:14:04.

The\nsustained pressure yielded\nan early try, finished with\na brilliant solo effort\nfrom Sam Hirons inside\nthe opposition 22. A well\nkicked conversion gave\nthe hosts an early 7-0 lead.\nThe game became a lot\ncagier for the rest of the\nhalf as errors from both\nsides slowed play down,\npreventing Imperial from\nextending their lead.\nSam Hirons doubled\nhis tally in the second\nhalf, making the most of\nthe referee\u2019s advantage\nby breaking through a\nseries of SOAS last ditch\ntackles to touch down.

For the decent price\nof \u00a325, I happened upon a\nfully complete in box version of Super Mario Kart\nfor the Super Nintendo\nEntertainment System.\nGiven my love for retro\ngames and that this was\nthe last Mario Kart game\nI needed to complete my\ncollection: I knew I had to\nmake the purchase.\nAfter thoroughly\ncleaning the cartridge, I\npopped it into my SNES\nand started up the game.\nAs is true with all retro\ngames, I was able to jump\nstraight into the action: 1\nplayer, 100cc, Mushroom\nCup. I chose Donkey\nKong Jr. (a character we\ndon\u2019t often see nowadays)\nand got to racing. The first\nthing I noticed was how\nstrange the track looked.\nOld 16-bit systems did not\nhave the power to run full\n3-D games, polygons and\nall,soinsteadtheycleverly\ndesigned 2-D images to\nlook 3-D (similar to the\noriginal DOOM). This\nwas very clear in the\nway that various barriers\nlooked completely flat and\nhow objects such as pipes\nand thwomps seemed to\nslowly creep towards you\nin increments of frames\nrather than smoothly\nincrease in size as you get\ncloser.\nOther than the look\nof the track, the driving\nwas initially jarring too.\nComing from playing a lot\nof Mario Kart 8, getting\nused to this older drifting\nsystem was quite the chal-lenge. There are no boosts\nfrom drifting and your\ndrift is not held if you\npress the other direction;\ninstead you just fling off\nto side, frequently going\noff-road and losing a lot\nof speed. This meant that\nI had to work hard at mastering the use of hopping\nback into a straight\nposition after a turn.\nThe soundtrack is\nwhere this game truly\nshines! Each type of\ntrack (e.g. Mario Circuit,\nBowser\u2019s Castle e.t.c.)\nhas its own song. The\nsoundtrack absolutely\nbops and remains a classic\nto this day. While I am\nwriting this article the\ntitle theme is playing in\nthe background, (much to\nthe dismay of my fellow\neditors)!\nWith all its positives,\nSuper Mario Kart clearly\nshows a lack of polish the\nmore recent iterations in\nthe franchise have been\nblessed with. Spinning out\nafter hitting an obstacle\ncan be very disorientating,\npeople prone to motion\nsickness beware! Not only\nthat but when you get hit\nby an obstacle or fall off\nthe stage, it takes so long\nto recover that your race\nis basically over. With\nall of that said I still had\nan amazing time with\nthe game. I don\u2019t think\nthat I have played for\nlong enough to consider\nmyself any good at it but\nI am definitely going to\nplay more so that I can\nimprove. I imagine the\n2-player mode is very\nhectic; sadly I haven\u2019t\nfound anyone willing to\nplay it with me yet!\nI hope everyone has\nhad a great week and be\nsure to check out some\ngames coming out this\nmonth!\nPOV: Ratchet and Clank 2016 ... just ... just why?\nH\naving just finished Ratchet\nand Clank 2016\nin its entirety I\nhave to say: considering\nthe great reviews, I\u2019m\nnot actually convinced\nreviewers were playing\nthe same game. Before I\nstart the inevitable ensuing rant, I would like to\nsay that the series holds a\nspecial place in my heart.\nI got into it when I was 9\nyears old and have been\na follower ever since;\nthe start to my R&C\njourney began with Tools\nof Destruction and then\nfollowed chronologically\nuntil Crack in Time, when\nI retroactively began\nplaying the earlier games\nafter the HD collection\nwas released (most of\nwhich I have platinumed).\nHere\u2019s my hot take:\nhaving played majority\nof the past games, I can\nhonestly tell you that R&C\n2016 is an utterly soulless\nremaster of the original.\nI will not contest that it\u2019s\na visual masterpiece akin\nto an ultra-high definition\nPixar game \u2013 but the magic of the earlier games just\nisn\u2019t there. The game has\nbeen stripped of its char-acter, presumably for fear\nof doing anything vaguely\ncontroversial as they shift\nto targeting a younger au-dience. It is left with none\nof the original\u2019s humour,\ncharacter development, or\neven the core message of\nits story.\nMy expectations were\nalready low, but they\ndropped further upon\nstarting up the game and\nbeing greeted by a generic menu and the absolute bullshit that is\nonly having one save file\n\u2013 something absolutely\nridiculous, given that the\nearlier and much older\ngames had multiple save\nslots. And it gets worse!\nI understand holding the\nplayer\u2019s hand, especially for younger players.\nHowever, compulsively\nspewing the same effing\nphrase of \u201cget the pixelis-er here\u201d every 15 seconds,\nwith Qwark\u2019s narration\npiping in every 8 and the\nenemies talking every 4\non top, is frustrating to\nsay the least \u2013 especially when combined with\nthe nauseating light show\nthat results from running a\nbullet hell game in 30fps.\nSo help me God, I swear\nthat every time I heard the\nweapons vendor screech\nabout a new unlock, the\nimminent rage-aneurysm\nthe game was concocting\ndrew closer by another minute \u2013 a doomsday\nclock on my life and soul\nas it was drained from me\nby the playing experience.\nAnd who could forget\nthat the game\u2019s cutscenes\nwere essentially copy and\npasted from the film - except with introductions of\nvillains being cut out despite originally being in\nthe film, which just left\nthe game feeling like even\nmore of a \u2018rush job\u2019.\nDon\u2019t get me started\nabout the lack of character development in the\ngame. There\u2019s no form of\nfriction between Ratchet\nand Clank, nor any sense\nof lessons being learned\nand attitudes changing,\nwhich was the essence of\nthe original\u2019s message of\nsettling one other\u2019s differences for the sake of a\ncommon goal. Neither is\nthere any form of friendship between the two char-acters. It\u2019s painful seeing\nthe complicated back-and-forth relationship\npresented in the original\ngame being bastardised so\nmuch; with no faults and\na perfect alliance it feels\nfake and unrealistic, and\nmore importantly it renders the characters two-di-mensional. In the end the\ngame\u2019s visual beauty is\nakin to makeup on a pig\n\u2013 you can make it prettier,\nbut it\u2019s not enough to hide\nthe underlying faults.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nConnor Winzar\nGames Editor\nEvery playable character in a hectic mess: the epitome of Mario Kart // Nintendo\nBeautiful visuals for an otherwise meh game // Sony\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\n6\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Hong Kong Protests\nComment Writer and Hong Kong native Andrew Lee gives his views on the ongoing protests in\nHong Kong.\nCOMMENT\nAndrew Lee\nComment Writer\nP\nrotests in Hong\nKong have been\nin the news\nfor almost 4\nmonths. Initially the\nprotests were targeted to\nstop the extradition law\nto pass. I am sure that\nmany are confused why\na seemingly common\nextradition law caused\nfull-scale riots and\nprotests. The proposed\nextradition law included\nan extradition agreement\nwith China. Hong Kong\nhas a completely different law system as it was\na British colony until\n1997. Most of the laws\nare British laws and the\nrule of law has been\nrespected for years. In\ncontrast, China\u2019s law\nsystem is widely considered to be a political tool\nfor the Communist Party.\nHong Kong people fear\nthat fugitives (fugitive\nfrom China\u2019s point\nof view can be very\ndifferent from ours!)\nsent back to China will\nreceive unfair treatment.\nThat\u2019s what made nearly\n1 million people take\nto the streets on 9 June\nwhich is roughly 1/8 of\nthe population of Hong\nKong.\nThe government\nremained unmoved and\nannounced that it would\ncontinue its work on\npassing the law. This infuriated the people and\ninspired some to start\nprotesting violently. As\nprotests started to get\nviolent, clashes between\nthe police and protestors\nbecame more intense.\nOn 21 July 2019, a\nmob of around hundred\narmed men attacked\ncivilians, who were\nmostly pro-democracy\nprotesters, at Yuen Long\nStation. Later it was\nfound that police had\nturned a blind eye to\nthe attack and the police\nforce was accused of\ncollusion with the mob.\nThis sparked more\nviolent protests, and\nthis is when the protest\nshifted its focus from\nanti-extradition to anti\npolice. On several oc-casions, the police force\nshowed a completely\nbiased attitude towards\nthe pro-government side\nand this included setting\nan armed pro-govern-ment protestor free\nafter they assaulted the\nopposition.\nP r o - d e m o c r a c y\nprotestors are called\ncockroaches by their\nopposition. Indeed, they\nhave showed the resilience of cockroaches. In\na recent report, around\n40 percent of arrested\nprotestors in the last 4\nmonths are aged under\n18. These young passionate protestors and\ntheir pursuit of freedom\nand western values will\npose a great threat to the\ngovernment in the long\nterm. I personally can\u2019t\nsee this clash ending\nwithout both the protestors and the government\ntaking a back step. It\nseems impossible that\nthe government is going\nto meet the 5 demands\nproposed by protestors\nwhich include universal\nsuffrage for the election\nof the chief executive and releasing all\nprosecuted protestors.\nMeeting some of these\ndemands will completely undermine the values\nof the Communist\nParty and potentially\ncause local uprising in\nmainland China.\nHowever, there is one\ndemand that is worth\nmentioning which is to\nset up an independent\ncommittee investigating\nthe misconduct of police\nduring the protests. I\nam very confident that\nprotests would die down\nafter this demand has\nbeen met. However if\nthe government insists\non ignoring the demands\nof the people, this will\nbe the start of a series\nof even more violent\nprotests and potentially\ntrigger an emigration\ncrisis.\nWith Hong Kong\nbeing sandwiched\nbetween the West and\nChina, the freedoms\nthat all Hong Kong\ncitizens celebrate and\nthrive under are getting\ntightened gradually by\nBeijing. Fueled with ri-The Hong Kong Protests // Flickr: Studio Incendo\n\u201cHowever\nif the\ngovernment\ninsists on\nignoring the\ndemands of\nthe people,\nthis will ...\npotentially\ntrigger an\nemigration\ncrisis.\"\ndiculous property prices\nand income inequality,\nthe anti-extradition\nprotests seem inevitable\nin retrospect.\nThe protest has\ninspired many to take\nside in either pro-de-mocracy or pro-govern-ment. From what I see,\nthe difference in political stance has caused\ntensions between friends\nand family. Many feared\nto express their opinions\nwhile some openly criticize others\u2019 opinion on\nsocial media. Perhaps\nwe should start respecting each other\u2019s opinion\nand try to talk our way\nthrough these. I never\nlove writing, not even\nin Chinese, but I could\nreally feel the drive to\nwrite about Hong Kong,\nthe only place that I\ncould call home.\n\n"

The subject\nin the foreground stands\nwith both hands outstretched at his sides, face\nup to the sky, while the\nother arches his back and\nholds a palm up in front\nof his head awkwardly.\nAs a Muslim, I can inform\nyou that neither action is\na legitimate stage in salat\nand the scene actually\ncontradicts the humility\nand rigour inherent to the\nritual.\nThe question of artistic\nintention is contentious,\nand particularly sensitive\nin the case of western\nobservation of cultures\nwhere imperial hegemony\nis historically rife. The\ncolonial context of the\norientalist movement\nsaw the commissioning\nof large quantities of art\nby North American and\nEuropean elite to perpetuate a political agenda of\nwhite superiority. This is\ndemonstrated in much of\nthe art displayed in this exhibition \u2013 local people of\nthe Middle East and North\nAfrica being presented as\nidle or primitive in scenes\ncapturing everyday life.\nAn extension to this is\nthe completely fabricated\nand perverted imaginings\nof the harem (domestic,\nwomen-only spaces that\nare intended for the preservation of privacy and\nmodesty). Paintings such\nas The Turkish Bath by\nJean-Auguste-Dominique\nIngres which depicts a\ngroup of nude women\nlounging in suggestive\nposes, ironically seem to\nobsessively fetishise the\nharem, whilst portraying it as an animalistic\nIslamic practice to elite\nwestern audiences. In the\nexhibition\u2019s final piece,\ncontemporary Turkish\nartist Inci Eviner protests\nand satirises this sexu-alisation, presenting her\nown fictitious Harem in\na looped video of women\nengaged in bizarre, possessed interactions.\nIt is undeniable that\nsome level of genuine\nadmiration for the Islamic\nworld is suggested by\nsome of these pieces \u2013 for\nexample, Jean-Baptise\nVanmour\u2019s illustration\nof Ottoman wealth and\npower in scenes of diplomatic ceremonies. Despite\nthis, an air of glib appropriation and ignorance is\noften maintained \u2013 John\nFrederick Lewis\u2019 self-por-trait as a \u2018Middle Eastern\u2019\nshows him draped in\na sash that is actually\nIndian. This is supported\nby the fact that many of\nthese pieces were created\nby artists who had never\ntravelled to the places\nthey portrayed, instead\nrelying on props and\nother art for inspiration.\nIndeed, it would seem\nthat art with exotic motifs\nwas the aim, rather than\nart with accurate Islamic\ninfluences. Though the\nexhibition acknowledges\norientalism\u2019s misrep-resentative nature, the\ncaptions predictably offer\nfairly subdued criticism,\nsettling for terms such\nas \u201cromanticised\u201d and\nleaving it to the viewer\nto consider the nuanced\nand often deliberately\ndeceitful nature of the\norientalist movement.\nDutchman - A Discomforting Enlightenment\nT\nhe playwright\nAmiri Baraka,\na famous\nAmerican Civil\nRights activist known by\nthe name of LeRoi Jones,\nwrote and produced\nDutchman in 1964, a time\nwhen African Americans\nwere not afforded the\nsame constitutional rights\nas white people. Racial\nsegregation, discrimination and violence were\ncommonplace and were\nBaraka\u2019s inspiration for\nthis tale.Today, unjustified\nracial violence, in particular towards black men, is\nconsistently in the head-lines, making this story as\nrelevant as ever.\nSet in a subway\ncarriage, Dutchman\nfollows the story of two\nstrangers \u2013 Lula, an eccen-tric, older white woman,\nand Clay, an unassuming,\nyoung black man \u2013 on a\njourney across New York.\nThe potential lovers seem\nto echo the familiar trope\nof \u2018forbidden\u2019 biracial\nromance between a white\nfemale and a black male\nthat is most notably\nexplored in Shakespeare\u2019s\nOthello, with several key\ndistinctions. Lula is the\naggressor: she boards the\ntrain eating an apple and\ncoquettishly moves about\nthe carriage to initiate a\nflirtatious conversation\nwith Clay after accusing\nhim of staring at her\nlegs. Although he is at\nfirst shocked by Lula\u2019s\nadvances, Clay quickly\nbecomes intrigued when\nshe makes several correct\nassumptions about who he\nis, based on her stereotype\nof black men.\nThe dance of seduction\ncontinues to a horrifying\nclimax, suggesting that\nthe true casualty of the\nbiracial sexual struggle,\nis the black man. Baraka\u2019s\nuse of symbolism is\nsubtle but effective. The\nsetting of a moving train\nhighlights the continuous\npresence of the racial\nissues discussed \u2013 especially ironic given the\ntime since it was first\nperformed. The apples\nLula eats and offers to\nClay liken her to Eve,\ncommitting the original\nsin and causing human\nsuffering.\nBoth protagonists\nhave respective outbursts\nwhich are noticed by\nthe other passengers on\nthe train. The contrast\nbetween their reaction\nof mild amusement at\nLula\u2019s verbal tirade and\nabject fear and revulsion\nat Clay\u2019s defensive\nmonologue is starkly reminiscent of the systematic\ncriminalisation of black\nmen in media and society.\nClay is played by\nJames Barnes, whose\ninconsistent New Jersey\naccent does not do justice\nto his otherwise powerfully emotive performance.\nCheska Hill-Wood\u2019s\nmaddeningly consummate portrayal of Lula\nincites the perfect level\nof shock, embarrassment\nand unease.\nLula freely and frequently uses derogatory\nterms such as \u2018n****\u2019,\nwhich achieve the desired\neffect of horror. However,\narchaic references such\nas \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 (someone\nsubservientkeentowinthe\napproval of white people)\nand \u2018Charlie Brown\u2019 are\na little out of reach for\nthe modern audience. By\nno means could this play\nbe described as easy to\nwatch but since when\nhave discussions about\nracism been easy? The\ndirector, Kaitlin Argeaux\ncommented that \u201cto not\nsee colour\u201d is a privilege\nafforded mainly to Caucasians\u201d, Dutchman is\na distressing but crucial\nperformance that renders\nseeing and confronting\ncolour unavoidable.\nWith strong sexual\nimagery, violence and\nan unexpected finale,\nDutchman is sure to keep\nyou entertained. It\u2019s a little\nlike watching a horror\nmovie - you\u2019re scared and\nuncomfortable but you\nalso don\u2019t want it to end.\nBe ready to have your\npreconceptions about race\nand identity questioned.\nTheatre of Nations, Shukshin\u2019s Stories // Sergey Petrov\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAn uninvited, ritual seduction // Diana Patient\nUnsettling parallels are drawn between Black Lives Matter and the Civil Rights Movement\nARTS\nAsad Raja\nArts Writer\nWhere?

The tradition has its origins in the\nearly history of Imperial\nCollege, when the three\nconstituent colleges (RCS,\nRSM, CGI) were merged.\nEach college wanted\nsomething to display its\nown identity and so made\na college mascot.\nThe aim of the game\nis simple \u2013 to \u2018relieve\u2019\nanother union of their\nmascot, and hold it\nransom. The union whose\nmascot has been stolen\nmust then pay a ransom\n(which can be any sort of\nrequest within reason) or\ntry to steal it back. The\ninteresting part is the theft\nitself. Many a carefully\nplanned heist has been\nthwarted by leaked infor-mation, a double agent, or\nby sheer brute force of the\nopposition.\nA union usually has\ntwo kinds of mascot \u2013\nviolate and inviolate.\nViolate mascots may be\n\u2018violated\u2019 i.e. stolen and\nheld to ransom, and inviolate mascots must not be\nstolen. Our violate mascot\nis called Theta the Thermometer. It is a 7-foot-tall\nsolid steel thermometer,\nwhich weighs in at over\n100 pounds. The current\ntheta is the 4th in a lineage\nof theta mascots and was\nforged on the lathe of the\nRCS motor club in 1975.\nOur inviolate mascot is a\nvintage 1916 Dennis fire\nengine named Jezebel (a\nbiblical name meaning\nscarlet lady). She is\nlooked after and manned\nby the RCS Motor Club\nand is the official transport\nof the RCSU president. If\nanyone tries to steal Jez,\nwe call the police!\nUnfortunately, the sport\nof mascotry has died down\nin the past few years. With\nthe student body showing\nwaning interest in the constituent unions, it\u2019s significantly more difficult to\nconvince people to carry a\n100-pound lump of metal\nwhile being chased by a\nhordeofangryGuildsmen.\nNowadays, its mostly\ncommittee members who\nget involved in mascotry,\nand a select few at that.\nIn some ways, that\u2019s fair\nenough; I never cared\nabout or knew about Theta\nbefore I became president.\nHowever, now that I\u2019m\nhere, I see how much\nthe constituent unions\ncould do for the students\nof Imperial. While a\nsilly thing like mascotry\ndoesn\u2019t directly affect\nmost students, it allows\nfor us to have a greater\nsense of identity rather\nthan being an \u201cImperial\nstudent\u201d.\nIn any case, if you see\nsomeone carrying a giant\nthermometer, maybe\ndouble check that they\u2019re\nan RCSU member. Who\nknows when the CGCU\nwill want revenge.\nThis article was\npartially adapted with\npermission from Richard\nFautley\u2019s Broadsheet\narticle \u2018RCSU Mascotry\u2019.\nAlex, the RCSU President, on Jezebel! // RCSU\n\n"

This and the\nvery short ornital period\nof a planet with the mass\nof Jupiter were some of\nthe reasons that their discovery was met with skep-ticism. However, because\nof short orbital period\nof 4 days, it was possible\nfor other researchers to\nvery quickly verify and\nvalidate their discovery.\nThis was the starting point\nof a new \ufb01eld of astro-physics, namely the study\nof exoplanets and planet\nformation.\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nScience Editor\n\u00a9 Johan Jarnestad //The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences\nA timeline of our Universe extending from an unknown origin on the left to a\ndarkening future on the right //The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences\n\u201cBoth have\nplayed an\nessential\nrole in our\nunderstanding\nof the cosmos\nand Earth\u2019s\nplace in the\nuniverse\u201d\n\u00a9 Johan Jarnestad //The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences\nScience editor S\u00e2nziana Foia gives an overview of the research behind this year\u2019s science Nobel Prizes.\nPeebles\u2019 has constructed\na model that allows us\nto describe the Universe\nfrom its \ufb01rst moment and\nup into the distant future.\nMoreover, Peebles\u2019 work\nwas a cornerstone in\nestablishing the composition of the universe \u2013 of\nwhich only 5% is ordinary\nmatter and the rest is comprised of dark matter and\ndark energy!\nBack in 1995, Mayor\nand Queloz discovered\na gaseous planet 150\ntimes the size of Earth,\nthe \ufb01rst to be identi\ufb01ed\noutside our solar system,\n50 light years away from\nChemistry\nU\nsed in\ne v e r y t h i n g\nfrom mobile\nphones to electric vehicles and laptops,\nlittle thought is often given\nto what keeps powering\nthe world we live in \u2013\nlithium ion batteries.

The Met\u2019s\nhas banned all protests\nlinked to the XR \u2018Autumn\nUprising\u2019 under Section\n14 of the Public Order\nAct.

The ban has also\nbeen called unlawful by\nAmnesty International,\nthe world\u2019s leading human\nrights organization, and\nthe legitimacy of arrests\nhas been questioned by\nlaw experts, as over 1,600\narrests have been made.\nThe decision to ban\nXR protests has caused\npublic uproar and was\nmet with widespread crit-icism. Politicians, human\nrights groups and leading\nenvironmental figures\nhave condemned the ban.\nAdam Wagner, a Human\nrights lawyer has called\nthe Metropolitan Police\u2019s\nban \u2018draconian and extremely heavy-handed\u2019.\nGreta Thunberg has\nencouraged protestors to\ndefy the city-wide ban,\non her Instagram, she\nwrote \u201cIf standing up\nagainst the climate and\necological breakdown and\nfor humanity is against the\nrules then the rules must\nbe broken.\u201d The Extinction Rebellion has also\nencouraged protestors to\ndefy the ban, the releases\na statement saying:\n\u201cFollowing the decision\nto ban peaceful protest in\nLondon, we are calling\non everyone to assemble\nin Trafalgar Square to\ndefend our civil liberties.\u201d\nThe ban has faced huge\nbacklash and the public\nis in defiance.

It\nis also apparent, that the\npublic is appalled by this\nintervention, which is also\nconsidered disproportionate to the action of the\nprotestors. The injustice\nof this ban is particularly\nupsetting, as in the UK\npeople have always had\nthe right to protest peace-fully, the crackdown on\npeaceful protests is reminiscent of governments\nwith terrible human rights\ntrack records. There will\nbe a lot of tension between\nprotestors and the police\nover the coming weeks,\nas neither side wants to\nback down. Furthermore,\nthere will be intense legal\nbattles in court, as the\nlegality of the ban is put\ninto question.\n38\n\n"

A company\u2019s balance sheet will\nalways include assets\nand liabilities, which\nmeans equity can be\neasily calculated. If the\ntotal equity is positive,\nthis means the business\u2019\nassets generate enough\nvalue to cover the costs\nof its liabilities. In case of\nnegative equity, liabilities\nexceed the value of the\nassets. Should that trend\ncontinue for an extended\nperiod of time, the firm\nwill be facing insolvency.\nA company is deemed\ninsolvent when it can no\nlonger pay off its debts.\nInsolvency should not\nbe confused with bank-ruptcy, which is a court\norder specifying how the\ndebts will be settled and\nwhat assets will probably\nhave to be sold for that\npurpose.\nments, local authorities\nandcorporationsaresome\nof the main examples of\nbond issuers. Afterwards,\nan individual investor, or\nmore frequently, a group\nof investors, buy the\nbond and hence lending\nmoney to the issuer for a\nspecified period of time.\nThe agreement between\nlender and borrower lists\nthe sum to be provided\nalong with the interest\nrate. The latter is determined by the credit rating\nof the borrower.An entity\nthat is viewed more likely\nto default on its debts has\na low credit rating, while\nthe opposite holds for\nan institution with a high\ncredit rating. It is worth\nmentioning that lenders\ntend to sell bonds to other\ninvestors in the bond\nmarket. A bond which\nhas been resold multiple\ntimes indicates the\nmarket is confident in the\nissuer\u2019s ability to repay\nthe bond. Therefore, the\ncredit rating reflects investors confidence in the\nparticular organisation.\nEquity vs. Bonds: A\ncomparison\nits initial value at the\ntime of purchase equals\nthe investor\u2019s profit.\nHowever, investing\nin shares is inherently\nrisky since no guarantee\nexists that the firm\u2019s\nvalue will appreciate\nover time. Historically,\nthe stockmarket has been\nvolatile, going through\nperiods of substantial\nlosses followed by intervals of profitability. On\nthe other hand, bonds\nprovide stable income\nat specific dates and are\nthus viewed as less risky\ncompared to equity. Furthermore, bond holders\nare prioritised over\nshareholders with regards\nto repayment; holders\nof company stock are\npaid dividends from the\nprofits on a regular basis,\nusually every quarter. In\ncontrast, shareholders\nDiscussing Bonds\nA bond constitutes an\nentirely different method\nof fundraising. Bonds can\nbe thought of as financial instruments which\ninclude the sum of money\nborrowed and when that\namount has to be repaid\nby the borrower. Particularly, every bond contains\na deadline for paying off\nthe principal of the loan,\ni.e. the original amount\nborrowed, as well as a\nfixed interest repayment\nschedule. This fixed\ninterest is known as the\ncoupon rate of the bond.\nThe question is, how do\nbonds work?\nInitially, an entity that\nwants to raise capital\nissues a bond. GovernThe standard formula for calculating equity // WallStreetMojo\n\u201cWhen\ndiscussing\nequity, most\npeople are\nfocused on\nfirms and\nare hence\nreferring to\nshareholder\nequity.\u201d\ngeneral, equity is the\nmeasure of ownership in\na particular asset after\ninfluence the firm\u2019s direction to a large degree\nbecause they are granted\nvoting rights and can thus\ndecide which people sit\non the board of directors.\nThe Last Word\nIt has become evident\nthat equity and bonds\nserve the same purpose\nbut in very different\nways. The first provides\ncorporations with access\nto capital in exchange\nfor an ownership stake,\nwhile the latter serves as\na direct method of raising\nfunds, usually needed for\nlarge amounts of capital\nthat banks cannot lend.\nGiven how they differ in\nterms of the profit they\nmay yield and how risky\nthey can be, investors typically choose to include\nboth in their portfolios.\nall debts associated with\nthat asset have been\nsubtracted.

    "content": "rsary Announcements\n\u201cRiot has, in\nshort, decided\nthat they are\ngoing to war\nwith Blizzard\u201d\n\u2018Project A\u2019: The Tactical Shooter\nThe first game announced by Riot that is\ncompletely separate from\nLeague and the world of\nRuneterra, \u2018Project A\u2019 is\na character-based tactical\nshooter with a whole new\nset of characters and a\nfresh near-future Earth\nsetting. There are few\ndetails available for now,\nbut on the gameplay side\na lot of focus seems to be\ngoing toward developing\nhigh-impact character\nabilities and smooth\ngunplay to keep the game\ncompetitive. Furthermore,\na lot of investment is going\ninto high-end infrastructure changes, to combat\nissues such as aimbots\nand \u2018peeker\u2019s advantage\u2019\n(where latency means the\nperson peeking around a\ncorner gets information,\nand a chance to shoot,\nbefore the person on the\nother side.) More details\nwill be shared throughout\n2020.\nLegends of Runeterra: The Card Game\nAh, Riot isn\u2019t even\ntrying to hide it at this\npoint: this is a Hearthstone-killer. However,\nit doesn\u2019t appear to be\njust another clone. There\nwas a real sense from the\ndevs that this is a passion\nproject \u2013 one they\u2019re\ncommitted to keeping\nfree from the evils of\nrandomised loot boxes\nfor cards. The game will\nfeature League and other\nRuneterra-based champions as powerful cards,\nwith a supporting cast of\ncards with both familiar\nand unfamiliar faces. This\nproject seems by far the\nclosest to completion,\nwith alpha pre-registration\nalready active and early\ngameplay being streamed\nafter the main show. (If\nyou\u2019re a card-game nut,\nget in touch and let us\nknow what you think so\nfar!)\n\u2018Project F\u2019???:\nThe ARPG(?)\nYes, that is a lot of\nquestion marks. Riot\nconspicuously displayed\nwhat appeared to be a\nDiablo-style ARPG,\npotentially with MMO\nelements, in the background of their announce-ments, but didn\u2019t offer\nany comment. I know;\nthey\u2019re just teasing us at\nthis point. We\u2019ll refrain\nfrom diving too heavily\ninto speculation, but the\nshort gameplay clips of\nan isometric Blitzcrank,\ng o o m b a - s t o m p i n g\nminions already look like\na blast.\nEsports Manager\nFinally! The return\nof some form of fantasy\nesports for League! The\ngame will feature two\nmodes: a campaign-style\nsingle-player game, and\na ranked system where\nyou can compete against\nothers. Sadly, it will\ninitially launch with only\nLPL teams in 2020 but\napparently will look to\nexpand to include other\nregions. As soon as they\ndo, I\u2019m creating what\nI\u2019m half-convinced will\nactually be the 2020 G2\nteam with role-swapping\nPerkz as support, Caps\nas ADC, and Faker in\nmid \u2013 the memes are just\ntoo good to resist. There\u2019s\nfurther good news: a\nportion of all proceeds\nwill be reinvested back\ninto the pro scene!\nAnd the honourable\nmentions\u2026\nThere\u2019s a couple of\nother things worth mentioning here \u2013 yes, even\nmore. Firstly, there was\na very brief mention and\na snippet of a potential\nnew board game being\ndeveloped \u2013 but not\nenough information to\nsay anything concrete\njust yet. Secondly \u2013 Riot\nannounced a full-on\nanimated show called\nArcane, which seems to\nbe based on the history\nof Jinx and Vi in the\nconjoined microcosms\nof the Runeterran cities\nof Zaun and Piltover.\nChampions like Ekko and\nEzreal were also spotted\nin the extended trailer previewed during the show.\nFans of League have been\nasking for it for years\nand years \u2013 and finally,\nRiot has delivered, with\nan expected release date\nwithin the next year.\nSo what does all this\nmean?\nThe clue is in the\ntitle. Not only has Riot\nmanaged to mostly keep\nthe development of most\nof these games a complete\nsecret, but they\u2019ve also\nmanaged to organically\nannounce them at the\nperfect moment.\nBlizzard has, for a\nlong time, had a powerful\ninfluence on the Western\ngaming market. With huge\nblockbuster successes like\nWorld of Warcraft and\nStarcraft under their belt,\nBlizzard has shaped entire\ngenres and arguably kick-started the modern esports\nphenomenon. Over the\nyears, they\u2019ve expanded\ntheir collection of games,\noften championing a\nsingle game per genre.\nThey have Hearthstone for\ncard games; Overwatch\nfor shooters; Heroes of\nthe Storm for MOBAs;\nWoW for MMORPGs;\nDiablo for ARPGs; and so\non. Each of these games\noverlaps and (whether\ncanon or not) inherit lore\nand style and context from\none another \u2013 Heroes of\nthe Storm, for example,\nfeatures characters from\nacross all of Blizzard\u2019s\nlibrary. Each is also\nmanaged via the Blizzard\nlauncher, a centralised app\nfor all their games.\nRiot has, in short,\ndecided that they\u2019re going\nto war with Blizzard.\nHaving announced the\ndevelopment of a suite of\ngames drawing from the\nsame universe \u2013 Runeterra\n\u2013 they\u2019ve set themselves\nup to emulate the same\nbusiness model. This is\nno accident; Riot has\neven recently revamped\nthe launcher for League\ninto a more general Riot\nGames launcher, with the\nnow-apparent intention of\nusing it as a base launcher\nfor a variety of games in\nthe same way as Blizzard\ndoes. They even jokingly\nreferenced Blizzard\u2019s\ngaff last year (regarding\nthe comment on whether\nplayers have phones)\nwhile delivering their\nBlizzard\u2019s equivalents:\nnetcode for Overwatch\n(and shooters in general)\nand microtransactions for\nHearthstone.\nAnd it\u2019s the perfect\nmoment. Blizzard\u2019s\nrecent controversies have\nleft them vulnerable \u2013 a\nlukewarm Blizzcon last\nyear, the casual axing of\nthe entire Heroes of the\nStorm esports scene, and\nmost recently banning and\nrescinding the winnings\nof a tournament player\nwho shouted \u201cliberate\nHong Kong\u201d in a post-game interview. Riot must\nhave been planning these\nannouncements months in\nadvance \u2013 but fortune has\nsmiled upon them, as the\ngiants they\u2019re hoping to\nslay have shot themselves\nin the foot just over a\nweek prior.\nOnly time will tell\nif this incredibly bold\nmarket takeover will be\nsuccessful \u2013 but aside\nfrom all that, frankly, I\u2019m\njust excited to play some\namazing-looking games.\nLegends of Runeterra features League champions as powerful cards you base strategies around // Riot Games\nISSUE 1730\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nmobile announcements.\nThey\u2019re going even\nfurther: several of their\nnewly-announced games\nwill be direct competitors to flagship Blizzard\ntitles. \u2018Project A\u2019 will\ncompete with Blizzard\u2019s\ncharacter-based shooter\nOverwatch, Legends of\nRuneterra similarly seeks\nto entice Hearthstone\u2019s\nplayerbase, and the\nARPG-style game will\ndraw Diablo fans.

A game\nwe all know and\nlove. Some dub\nit the \u2018Perfect\nGame\u2019 and for good\nreason. Created in 1984\nin the USSR by Alexey\nPajitnov, it quickly took\nthe world by storm with its\naddictive yet deceptively\nsimple gameplay. Selling\nover 170 million copies to\ndate, the general concept\nhas remained the same:\none of seven tetrominoes\nfalls from the top of the\nscreen, you can rotate it in\nany direction but once it\nhits the \ufb02oor it is stuck in\nplace. Do this repeatedly\nwith the aim of \ufb01lling an\nentire row\u2026 once you \ufb01ll\na row, that row is deleted.\nKeep going until you mess\nup and the whole screen is\n\ufb01lled to the top!\nRelatively simple right?\nWell, it is harder than you\nmight think, and with increasing levels of speed as\nthe game goes on you will\n\ufb01nd that there is a huge\ndisparity between skilled\nplayers and newbies. With\nseemingly no limit to the\nskill cap of this game,\nmany hardcore players\nhave turned to create a\ncompetitive scene out of\nthe game.\nCTWC\nThe Classic Tetris\nWorld Championship\nis hosted every year at\nthe Portland Gaming\nExpo and is taking place\nthis weekend from the\n18th \u2013 20th October. The\ncompetition launched in\n2010 during the \ufb01lming\n\u201cEven before\nthe first CTWC,\nJonas and\nHarry were\nrivals\u201d\n\u201c...the\nconsistency\nof Jonas over\nthe last decade\ncannot be\npushed under\nthe rug\u201d\nthe highest score you\npossibly can. Harry and\nJonas were both going for\nthe max-out when it was\n\ufb01rst achieved, making the\n2010 CTWC effectively\na grudge match between\nthe two. Jonas pulled off a\nwin in the \ufb01nals, exacting\nhis revenge over Harry.\nThis dominance over\nHarry would continue,\nwinning every following\nCTWC until 2014. Master\nHong was on \ufb01re this year,\neasily taking a 3-1 victory\nover Jonas and downing\nthe Titan. Unfortunately,\nsince 2014 Harry has not\nseen anywhere near the\nsame level of success.\nThe Virtuoso\nOther than 2014, Jonas\ncontinued to see unparalleled success in the\nworld of Tetris, achieving\nmultiple world records\nin different categories\nand consistently winning\nmajor tournaments.\nHowever, in early 2018\na young 16-year old boy\nfrom California began\nto rise to fame due to\nhis ability to play past\nthe level 29 kill-screen.\nThe way he does this is\nby utilising a technique\ncalled \u2018hyper-tapping\u2019.\nHyper-tapping is as it\nsounds \u2013 tapping insanely\nfast \u2013 by vibrating the\ncontroller between your\nthumb and the rest of your\nhand. This means that you\ncan move the piece far\nfaster than the traditional\nmethod of simply holding\ndown a direction and thus,\nif your brain works fast\nenough, you can continue\nto play past level 29 and\nbeyond.To date, his record\nis level 34, a completely\nunprecedented realm that\nno one else has even come\nclose to achieving. In the\nsame year that Joseph \ufb01rst\nappeared, he completely\nshocked the Tetris world\nby stealing the limelight\nfrom Jonas and being\nthe 3rd ever CTWC\nchampion; his victory was\nso dominant that Jonas\nwas unable to take a single\ngame from Joseph. Since\nthen Joseph has continued\nthe same spell of dominance shown by Jonas in\nyears prior, taking world\nrecord after world record\nand innovating like no\nother before him.\nThis Year\nUnlike in previous\nyears, the outcome of this\nWorld Championship is\ntruly unpredictable. Many\npros expect Joseph to take\nback to back victories,\nbut the consistency of\nJonas over the last decade\ncannot be pushed under\nthe rug \u2013 the man knows\nhow to deal with pressure\non the big stage. Other\nprominent players are\nin the running: Koryan,\na long-time player from\nJapan who also utilises\nhyper-tapping has been\ngetting closer and closer\nto winning, reaching\n4th place in both 2016\nand 2018. Moreover,\nmeme-famous Jeff Moore\n(TETRIS FOR JEFF)\nwho came in 2nd place in\n2016 is making his return\nthis year. With a huge\nline-up of highly regarded\nplayers, who knows what\nis going to happen?\nIf you are interested in\nchecking it out be sure to\nwatch the CTWC Twitch\nchannel this weekend to\n\ufb01nd out who\u2019s going to\ntake home the beautiful\nT-Block trophy!\nJoseph Saelee, Jonas Neubauer and Harry Hong pictured left to right // thectwc.com\nof Ecstacy of Order: The\nTetris Masters (A great\ndocumentary that I would\nhighly recommend) to\ndetermine the \u2018World\u2019s\nGreatest Tetris Player\u2019.\nTo standardise the playing\n\ufb01eld, everybody plays on\nthe original NES version\nof the game from 1989.\nAn old Nintendo World\nChampionship competitor\nof Tetris, Trey Harrison,\ncreated speci\ufb01c code so\nthat in 1v1 situations\nboth competitors would\nreceive the random selection of blocks in the\nsame order to eliminate\nthe luck factor involved.\nWith these rules set in\nplace, it allows for a very\nprofessional atmosphere\nand unique playstyles to\nshine, whether it be the\n\u2018centre well\u2019 antics of\nThor Aackerlund or the\nextreme \u2018hyper-tapping\u2019\nof last year\u2019s champion\nJoseph Saelee.\nIn the 9 years the\ntournament has been\nrunning, Jonas Neubauer\n(the \ufb01rst-ever champion)\nhas been the dominant\nforce.

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\n14\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGiselle: a bold reimagination of a classic ballet\nD\nada Masilo\nis famous for\nher works\nwhich rework\nthe plots of well-known\nclassical ballet pieces.\nHer previous works\ninclude her interpretation\nof Swan Lake which\nincluded twists such as\na homosexual Siegfried,\nand social commentary on\nsexism and homophobia.\nHer vision for Giselle is\nequally refreshing, with\na focus on storytelling,\nand presenting the audience with unforgiving\nprotagonist.\nGiselle (played by cho-reographer, Dada Masilo\nherself) is the young\npeasant girl who falls in\nlove with the nobleman\nAlbrecht (played by\nLwando Dutyulwa).\nAfter discovering that he\nwas already promised to\nanother woman, Giselle\ndies of heartbreak. The\nsecond act sees Giselle\nsummoned by a group of\nvengeful spirits called the\nWilis. They are supernatural women who have\nthe power to force men to\ndance until death from ex-haustion, and Giselle joins\nthem to enact her revenge.\nThe choreography of\nMasilo\u2019s Giselle is hugely\ninnovative and exciting.\nThe fusion of classical\nballet with contemporary\ndance was done to per-fection, and the addition\nof African dance makes\nthe performance a unique\nvisual masterpiece. The\ndance is far more expressive and emotional than\nan average ballet, and\nthe passion of the dance\nmakes the story feel much\nmore raw and real than\nthe traditional more conserved story of Giselle.\nA notable difference\nfrom the original Giselle,\nis the influence of African\nculture, as Masilo re-imagines the setting of\nGiselle in South Africa.\nThis is very prominent in\nthe music that is layered\nwith African voices and\npercussion. There is also\nthe addition of the scene\nof Giselle going through\nan African ritual with her\nmother, and the changing\nof the leader of the Wilis,\nMyrtha, to an African\nhealer.\nThe stage production\nalso complemented the\ndance immensely, to\ncreate an immersive piece\nof art. The stage and\ncostumes are minimal-istic but impactful and\neffective. The beautiful\nred outfits of the Wilis are\nparticularly striking. They\nsymbolize viciousness\nwhich contrast with the\nwhite dresses of purity\nand innocence in the\noriginal.\nThe performance also\ndefies certain conventions\nof ballet, and there is an\nelement of surprise that\nkeeps the audience on the\nedge of their seats. There\nwas dialogue, chanting,\nand acting, which all\ncontribute to the organic\nstorytelling.The inclusion\nof nudity accentuates the\nvulnerability of Giselle.\nThere was also the gen-derbending of two of the\nWilis played by androgynous male dancers, calling\ninto question the heter-onormative culture and\ngender norms of ballet.\nSubversion of traditional\nballet is daring, and by\nbreaking well defined\nboundaries, Masilo sheds\nlight on the infinite possibilities of ballet.\nOverall, Masilo\u2019s\nGiselle is an incredible\nmasterpiece, that is innovative and unique. It is an\nunapologetic piece of art\nthat is both ground-break-ing and visually stunning.\nWhen compared to the\noriginal, Masilo\u2019s Giselle\nis filled with more drama\nand raw emotion, making\nit incredibly exciting. I\ntruly believe Masilo\u2019s\nGiselle has the best storytelling through dance, and\nI believe it is a must-see.\nThe Watsons: Jane Austen spin-off fiction fan club\nL\naura Wade set\nherself up for a\ndifficult task: to\nfinish, as a play,\na novel that Jane Austen\ncouldn\u2019t complete. It follows the story of Emma\nWatson, a young woman\nused to a luxurious life-style, who finds herself\ndumped back home, and\nfinancially dependent\non her family. Several\nsuitors are introduced,\nfrom the local clergyman\nto an awkward lord and\nhis flirtatious friend. The\nintroduction is familiar, at\nleast for a regular Austen\nreader. That\u2019s when the\noriginal novel stops and\nWade comes in. Quite\nliterally - the character\nLaura, portrayed by\nLouise Ford, is the writer\nherself, transported to a\nfictional town in the 18th\ncentury with her modern\nlanguage and electronic\ndevices.\nThe play starts strong-ly, even before its official\nstart. The lights are on\nand two characters are on\nstage from the moment\nthe doors open, ignoring\nthe chatter among the\naudience. Then, a rapid\nsuccession of dialogues,\naided by Samuel West\u2019s\nclever direction, introduce\nall the characters. There is\na ball with music, dance\nand courtship, where the\nrelationships between\nthem become clear. These\nscenes are well construct-ed, dynamic without being confusing, and contain the exact amount of\ninformation we need to\nunderstand the world of\nthe play.\nWhen the source material stops is where the\nshow falters. In a rather\nlong and unconvincing\nscene, Emma Watson understands she is a character in a fictional work\nand goes from shock to\nnihilism, and then finally\nto rage. The news reaches the other characters,\nand the course of the story suffers a violent turn.\nThey all abandon their\nAustenian roles and destinies to become their own\npersons and write their\nown stories - yep! It is as\ncliche as possible, though\nI concede it is funnier than\none might expect. Laura,\nthe writer, tries and fails\nto keep control of the sto-ry, in an obsessive pursuit\nof the purest Austen style\n- a recurrent reference in\nthe play, which really is\nan extravagant homage\nto the great author. The\ncontrasts between the real\nand fictional world, and\nthe significant social and\ntechnological differences\nbetween the characters\u2019\nand the writer\u2019s time periods are often the sources of comic relief. I don\u2019t\nthink anyone has ever\ndescribed Candy Crush\nin such accurate detail be-fore!\nWade\u2019s fatal flaw is\ntrying to touch upon too\nmany subjects, from feminism to political legiti-macy, from the sense of\npurpose to the struggles of\nthe creative process. She\ndoes raise good points: her\nportrait of an artist\u2019s vulnerability when creating\nsomething new is beautifully honest, and her constant urge to question the\nstatus quo, although not\nnew, is freshly done. But\neverything is so fast and\ninconsequential that some\ntopics are only treated su-perficially, and tend to fall\ninto pseudo-intellectual-ism (alright - you can cite\nRousseau, but what comes\nfrom that?) or inexplicable events that lack credible motives or build-ups.\nIn the end, this show\nmakes for an agreeable\nand fun evening. It is just\na pity that it doesn\u2019t go\ndeeper and sticks to simple comedy. Laura herself\nsaid it - \u2018I like it when\nthey clap!\u2019\nMixing classical and contemporary makes Giselle more expressive // Laurent Phillippe\nARTS\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Always adapting\nand evolving to meet the\nneeds of the consumer,\nthe form-factor (i.e. the\ndesign) of these devices\nhave seen numerous variations and changes over\nthe past three decades.\nFrom the brick to \ufb02ipphones, early day mobile\nhandsets serve as the ancestors of the modern-day\nsmartphone. Their past\nplays a big role in where\ntheir future is headed.\nDespite being nearly\nthirty years apart, these\ndevices share a common\npurpose: to serve its user\nas a basic communication\ndevice. To be fair, neither\nof these devices, albeit\nmodern or retro, fall short\non that end.\nModern smartphones\ntake it a step further, with\nvideo call, internet voice\ncall, instant messaging,\nsocial media, video\nstreaming, etc. The reason\nwhy today\u2019s phones have\na much more multi-pur-pose nature is because\nthey\u2019re very personal\ndevices. Nobody would\nvariety. The design of the\nphone acted as identi\ufb01ers\nof the company they rep-resented; each phone possessed unique quirks and\nfeatures that signaled the\nbrand. An iconic example\nis a standard Blackberry\nhandset. Immediately\nrecognizable, this device\nstood out from the rest\nwith its square-shaped,\npalm-sized design with a\nfull-size physical keypad.\nCompanies saw selling\nphones to consumers as\na great pro\ufb01t-making\nopportunity and started\npushing out phones at\na rate higher than the\ndemand. It was inevitable\nthat mobile handsets were\nthe most effective way\nto stay connected with\nothers, and soon enough,\nwidespread adoption on\na global scale took place.\nIn effect, it was a matter\nof competition between\nsmartphone vendors\nto produce phones that\nattracted consumers. With\nthis trend came handsets\nthat lacked the ease-of-use factor and had way\ntoo many unnecessary\nfeatures; to put it simply,\nthey weren\u2019t centered\naround the user. Rather,\nthese devices were aimed\nat increasing their brand\u2019s\nshare of the market and\nthe pro\ufb01ts that came with\nit.\nEver remember the day\nwhen you had to press a\nkey multiple times for a\nletter to show up? Well,\nthat\u2019s exactly how it was\nin retro mobile handsets\nwith the exception of\nthose that possessed a full\nkeypad. With physical\nkeypads and buttons,\nthese devices didn\u2019t have\na large screen real estate.\nAs a matter of fact, their\nphysical footprint wasn\u2019t\nnearly as large as today\u2019s\nsmartphones, well, with\nthe exception of the retro\nbrick cell phone.\nDue to their minimum\nfunctionality, the structure\ntended to be more versatile and thus came in many\nforms, one of the most\niconic being the capability\nto \u201c\ufb02ip\u201d. Composed of\ntwo parts connected by\na hinge mechanism, this\ndesign saw the phone\nbeing split distinctly into\ntwo parts: the keypad and\nthe display. This method\nallowed for much larger\ndisplays while maintaining the same footprint\nwhile folded, albeit a bit\nthicker.\nAgain, keep in mind\nthat phones of this time\nwere mostly used for\ncalling, texting, e-mail,\nmemos, and playing very\nsimple games. Later, the\ncamera and music player\nwere integrated into the\nphone. This critical step\nessentially reduced the\nneed to carry two extra\ndevices.\nAnother key factor is\nthat almost all the software\non the phone was developed by the company that\nproduced it. There were\nlittle to none third party\nsoftware programs and the\nidea of an app store was\nstill a concept. In effect,\nthe past saw the usage of\n\u201csmartphones\u201d in a much\nprimitive way.\nOver the past two\ndecades, the functionality\nand ease-of-use of phones\nhave grown exponen-tially, thus making them\n\u201csmart\u201d. This key attribute\nalso includes the nature of\nthe device to link up with\nthe internet. Third party\nsupport has been more\nthan ever and the implementation of an app store\nprovides the device with\nan ever-increasing set of\nfeatures to keep the user\nengaged.\nToday\u2019s smartphone\nline-up are based on\ntwo primary platforms:\nAndroid and iOS. In the\npast, companies created\ntheir own proprietary OSs\nand frameworks. This is\nprimarily what lead to\nthe lack of third-party\nsupport.\nNow, imagine today\u2019s\nworld except that each\nbrand had their own proprietary OS, well, apart\nfrom Apple. Also, keep in\nmind that most third-party\nsupport either comes from\nsmall startups or the open\nsource community.\nThese groups don\u2019t\nhave the time to adapt\ntheir solutions to every\nplatform at the rate of\ndemand. In addition, this\nmess only truly shows\nitself when you com\u201cNobody\nwould want\nto carry one\ndifferent\ndevice for each\npurpose\u201d\nwant to carry one different\ndevice for each purpose;\nit just isn\u2019t practical in a\nfast moving world where\nthings have to be seam-lessly connected.\nComing back to retro\nphone design, it\u2019s evident\nthat there was quite a large\nPhones From The Past Ten - Twenty Years // Benedict Evans\nXiaomi Mi Mix Alpha // Xiaomi\n\n"

The report\nwas led by Dr. Richard\nCarmichael, an Imperial\nacademic working with\nthe Centre for Environental Policy, after the\nCCC appointed him to\nthe job.\nThe CCC is an independent body established\nunder the Climate Act of\n2008 in order to provide\nadvisement on future\npolicy and reporting on\ncurrent progress towards\nemissions goals.\nThe report itself identifies multiple key areas\nof attack, such as creating\nnew and compelling narratives to mobilise mainstream participation, a\nreduction in policy-based\nobstaclestomarketchange\nand consumer choice, and\nthe importance of data\nand ICT in allowing consumers to make informed\nchoices regarding technology adoption (e.g. electric\ncars). It contributed to the\nCCC\u2019s overall Net Zero\nreport to government.\nThe research of many\nImperial academics in this\ndirection stands in stark\ncontrast to the College\u2019s\ndecisions regarding fossil\nfuels.

Indeed, the\ntop four investor-owned\ncorporations (Chevron,\nExxon, BP, and Shell)\nhave contributed 10% on\ntheir own. Topping that\nchart is Chevron specifi-cally, who have contributed 43.35 billion tonnes of\ncarbon dioxide.\nThe President of the\nCollege, Alice Gast, sits\non the board of Chevron,\nand receives a salary of\napproximately \u00a3300,000\nper year for doing so.\nThere is a dichotomy\nbetween the excellent\nwork Imperial academics\ndo and the contradictory\nperspective of senior\nmembers of the College.\nEven senior staff who\nare very passionate about\nthe environment repeat\nthe \u2018partners\u2019rhetoric.

Felix Games\ngives the run-down, as well as speculates on what this\nsignals in terms of Riot\u2019s business plan going forward\nGAMES\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\n\u201cRiot is\nworking on\nnew netcode\ntechnology to\nreduce ping\nand latency\nissues\u201d\nT\nhe 10th-anniver-sary celebration\nof League of\nLegends took\nplace a few days ago \u2013\nand oh boy, did Riot pull\nout all the stops.\nThe day began with\nsome fun streams with\nvarious Riot employees \u2013\nsuch as a live concert of\nLeague music, a \u2018Twitch\nPlays\u2019, where the chat\nwas used to drive a robot\naround Riot HQ, and (my\npersonal favourite) an\nartist stream: where quick\nconcept art was made for\na variety of meme-worthy\nskin ideas. KDA Gragas\nwas a particular highlight.\nHowever, the real show\nbegan with a special\nepisode of \u2018Riot Pls\u2019, the\nstudio\u2019s version of a video\ndev blog. We at Felix\nGames are going to break\ndown the changes they\nannounced for League \u2013\nas well as the incredibly\nspicy news they shared\nabout finally putting the\n\u2018s\u2019 in Riot \u2018Games\u2019.\nFirst, pre-season\nchanges. They\u2019ve thematically dubbed the changes\n\u201cRise of the Elements\u201d.\nWe\u2019ll be diving into these\nin detail soon as more\ninformation is revealed,\nbut in short: welcome to\nRNG city. The random-ly-spawning elemental\ndragons (drakes) will now\ncause permanent changes\nto the map depending\non which drake spawns\nthird \u2013 such as destroying\nor building walls (laughs\nin Qiyana) or adding\nextra brushes to the map\n(laughs in Rengar). Drake\neffects have been tweaked\ntoo, especially the Elder\nDragon, which now no\nlonger amplifies the\neffects of previously-tak-en drakes but instead\noffers execution below a\ncertain health threshold.\nThey\u2019ve given everybody\nPyke ultimate on every\ndamaging ability \u2013 dear\nlord, it\u2019s the end of days.\nAdditionally, they\u2019ve\nadded extra brushes to the\njungle and small \u2018alcoves\u2019\nto the sidelanes \u2013 time for\nthe rise of Shaco support\n\u2013 as well as a slew of item\nand XP tweaks. Lastly,\nthey revealed a teaser\nfor a new marksman\nsupport champion: Senna,\nLucian\u2019s wife, whose soul\nwas previously trapped in\nThresh\u2019s lantern. Fun fact:\nThresh used to start with\none soul stacked already\nwheneverhefacedLucian,\nwhich presumably will\nhave to change.\nLastly: yes, the rumours\nwere true. League is going\nto console and mobile\nwith a revamped set of\nmechanics and models\nthat were built from the\nground-up, as is TFT. This\nis reassuring for mobile\ngame or console enthusiasts \u2013 after all, a pure port\nof a MOBA like League\njust wouldn\u2019t work.\nThe visuals of this new\nversion, dubbed \u2018Wild\nRift\u2019, look particularly\nimpressive, with some\npretty awesome character\nanimations that seem to\nplay as an introduction\n(possibly in champ select)\n\u2013 but whether it feels good\nto play will have to be\nseen.\nOh \u2013 and classic\nURF is coming back\nfor a couple of weeks.\nKarthus-induced carpal\ntunnel (which I\u2019m\ndubbing Karthpal tunnel)\nincoming. TFT is also\ngetting a new seasonal set\nof champions, essentially\nhitting reset on the meta\nand starting from the\nbeginning!\nNow \u2013 and I can\u2019t\nbelieve I\u2019m saying this \u2013\nthat\u2019s the \u2018boring\u2019 news\nout of the way. What a\nworld we live in when\nthose changes are the\nvanilla ones. Let\u2019s dig into\nthe plethora of new games\nRiot has just announced!\n\u2018Project L\u2019:\nThe Fighting Game\nRiot announced that\nthey were working on a\nfighting game at EVO this\nyear after the information\nhad previously been\nleaked, having acquired\nthe development team\nwho were working on the\nhighly-anticipated and\nthen cancelled \u2018Rising\nThunder\u2019 game three\nyears ago. However, this\nis the first time early\ndevelopment gameplay\nhas been shown \u2013 and it\nlooks incredibly slick.\nThe game will feature\ncharacters from Runeterra\nand League, with Darius,\nJinx, Ahri, and Katarina\nbeing seen duking it out\nin the preview. Sadly, the\nannouncement came with\na caveat: there won\u2019t be\nany more information\nfor a while. It\u2019s exciting\nnonetheless.\nOne thing that fighting\ngame enthusiasts will be\nexcited to hear is that Riot\nis working on some form\nof new netcode technology aimed at reducing\nthe impact of latency and\nping on gameplay \u2013 which\nwas officially announced\nas part of the next game\non our list.\nA screenshot of Riot\u2019s tactical shooter from their announcement video - looking smooth so far! // Riot Games\nGAMES\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n34\n\n"

A more recent\nexample of this is the\nSamsung Galaxy Fold\n\u2014 A \ufb02ip-phone inspired\nsmartphone with a radical\nmodern twist.\nWith smartphones\nlooking more alike than\never with all screen\ndisplays, smartphone\nvendors are pouring\nmoney into innovation\nto keep their brand name\nfrom hanging on the\nbalance. In this process,\nwe consumers gain access\nto devices that both meet\nour needs as well as the\nneeds of the manufactur-ers.\nThe \u201crectangular-slab\u201d\ndesign was so in\ufb02uential\nthat manufacturers found\nit convenient to stick\nwith it and go on from\nthere with their variants.\nHowever, the variables\n(screen size, frame,\ncamera layout, speaker\nplacement, etc.) they can\ncontrol are limited and\nit\u2019s only a matter of time\nbefore brands start to lose\ntheir identity. In other\nwords, there\u2019s only so\nmuch you can do with that\nspace.\nThere have been quite a\nfew companies that have\ntried to resolve this issue\nover the past year while\npromising to maintain\nsoftware support:\n\u2022 Samsung Galaxy Fold\nwith an inner foldable\nOLED display and a secondary screen on the front\nthese have been phones\nthat take different, more\ncost-effective approaches\nto uniqueness. The most\nsimple of these approaches being the layout\nand arrangement of the\ncamera system. The front\ncamera has recently seen\na tremendous amount of\nchange over the past two\nyears. With the different\nvariations of the \u201cnotch\u201d\nto cameras that \u201cpop-up\u201d\nfrom the outer casing of\nthe device, smartphone\nmanufacturers are truly\npushing, what I like to\ncall, silent innovation.\nThis kind of innovation\nserves, as previously said,\nto make the most out of\nthe space in a smartphone.\nExamples of this \u201csilent\ninnovation\u201d include:\n\u2022 Bending of the OLED\nscreen under the phone\u2019s\nmetal housing to eliminate the \u201cchin\u201d.

This is a very\ntedious job and doesn\u2019t\nmotivate radical design\nchanges; that is, it\u2019s hard\nto adapt the software to\nchanges in hardware. To\nput it simply, it just isn\u2019t\n\ufb01nancially practical.\nEven with these\nwidespread platforms,\nthe core functionality\nof the devices are most\nhighlighted by their app\nstores.

Ah, here\nwe go.

Convoluted\nhistory aside, tick, tick\u2026\nBOOM!hasbeenreceiving\na lot of attention of late, a\nsurprise given its relative\nobscurity. In fact, Netflix\nhas recently announced its\nown adaptation of the musical with none other than\nHamlet extraordinaire,\nLin-Manuel Miranda, set\nto direct.\nFrom the moment the\nlights dim and the story\nbegins, it is easy to understand why a musical set\nin the 1990s still strikes a\nchord with the audience of\ntoday. Over a background\nof incessant clockwork\nticking, the main char-acter, Jon (Alex Lodge)\nintroduces himself and\nexplains that the sound\nwe hear is the sound of\nhis mounting anxiety.\na steady countdown to\nan inevitable explosion.\nImmediately, I recognise\nthe image before me: a\nyoung man shaking with\nnervous energy, eyes\ndarting around looking\nfor some semblance of\nsecurity, desperate for a\nchange or a big break.\nForget the 1980s \u2013 this is\npeak millennial anxiety.\nAnd then Lodge breaks\ninto the opening number,\nthe ex-titular 30/90, and if\nanything could qualify as\na BOOM!, this was it. Attacking the fricative con-range to the emotional\nhighs and lows of his\ncharacter, spinning his\nhoneyed tones from cocky\nand braggadocious in the\ncomedy duet No More to\nheartrending and soulful\nin the mournful Real\nLife. I find his character\nand performance more\nconvincing than our often\nself-involved protagonist.\nPerhaps it\u2019s because\nMichael never breaks the\nfourth wall and speak to\nthe audience like Jon can,\nthe emotional distance\nadding a layer of vulnerability to his character.\nIfLodgeisthedominant\nand distinctive heart notes,\nand Hume the rich base\nnotes, Georgie Ashford\u2019s\nSusan rounds off the trio\nwith her lofty top notes\nthat contrast pleasantly\nagainst the men. A shame\nthen that her character is\nso underutilised. In fact,\nthe biggest issue I have\nwith this musical is the\nway all the women are\npresented. Susan, Jon\u2019s\ngirlfriend, dreams of\nmoving to the seaside\n(why are all women in\nmusicals obsessed with\nsettling down at the\nseaside?) and getting out\nof the rat race that Jon has\ntrapped them in with his\ninability to compromise\nor see beyond his own\nambitions. And yet the\nstory almost villainises\nher for not believing in\nJon\u2019s vision or sticking it\nout until he becomes suc-cessful. Unfortunately, all\nthe female characters are\neither obstacles to Jon\u2019s\nsuccess or an accessory\nto his ego. For example,\nthe second number\nGreen Green Dress is a\nsong purely about how\nattractive Susan looks in\na green dress. Although\na fun number, it does\nnothing for the plot and\ntells us nothing new\nabout the characters aside\nfrom Jon\u2019s functioning\nsex drive. It\u2019s basically a\ngratuitous sex scene in the\nform of a song. That\u2019s bad\nenough on its own, but a\ncloser look at the lyrics\nmight even make you\nstart to wonder about the\nconsent of it all.\nAnd that\u2019s kind of the\nproblem with the whole\nmusical. Even though\nthere are great moments\nof introspection and pertinent messages that ring\ntrue regardless of the time\nperiod, there is nothing\nremarkable or original\nabout the story. It\u2019s a tale\nas old as time: the archetypal suffering artist,\npressured by those around\nhim (and it\u2019s always a\nhim) to conform and give\nup on his dreams, is saved\nat the last minute by some\nlucky twist of fate. Only\nthis time, the story is told\nby really quite unreasonably talented actors and, oh\nyeah, they also sing a song\nabout Twinkies. As Jon\nremarks near the begin-ning, it\u2019s \u201chard for people\nborn after 1960 to be idealistic or original\u201d. How\ntrue he was!

These demonstrate immense skill and\nare interesting to look\nat, but the oil-on-canvas\nportraits are also far\nfrom conventional. His\nuse of colour is intense\nand subjects are rarely\ndepicted sitting or with\ntheir families behind\nthem. In the \u201cfamily\nand friends\u201d collection,\nthere is Young Breton\nWoman. In this portrait\nan aristocrat\u2019s daughter\nis seated beneath a coat\nof arms and fleur-de-lys.\nThe indication of social\nstanding is usual for a\nportrait, but Gauguin also\nadded a sculpture of his\nown in the background - a\nfigure of a naked woman\nexuding menstrual blood.\nThe combination of this\nsculpture with the subject\u2019s dejected facial expression give the painting\na disturbing quality. The\nexhibition caption tells us\nthat, unsurprisingly, the\naristocrat did not buy the\nportrait.\nDiscomfort upon\nviewing his works con-tinues, especially those\nthat were created during\nhis time in Polynesia.\nWithout context, many of\nthese are beautiful, and at\nfirst glance it is almost refreshing to see non-white\nwomen as the subjects\nin a post-impressionist\nexhibition. However, once\nit is learned that Gaugain\n\u201cmarried\u201d two of these\nwomen when they were\n13 and fathered their\nchildren, it is difficult to\nsee any beauty in Gauguin\u2019s depictions of them.\nThe exhibition also\nincludes surrogate por-traits. These are still-life\npaintings that have been\ninterpreted to represent\nimportant people in Gauguin\u2019s life. A surrogate of\nVan Gogh is his sunflow-ers; the rich colours of\nthese paintings give them\nincredible depth, and it\nis Gauguin\u2019s depiction\nof flowers, whether they\nare to represent people\nor not, that stand out as\nhis most striking work.\nGiven what we\u2019ve learned\nabout his views earlier on\nin the exhibition, though,\nit is difficult to want one\nof his prints, however\nbeautiful, on a notebook\nor a cushion.\nS\nir Ian McKellen:\nthe mere prospect\nof seeing him\nlive would stir up\nexcitement in any Lord of\nthe Rings or Shakespeare\nfan. And that was very\nmuch how I felt \u2013 I mean,\nwho wouldn\u2019t want to see\nGandalf live? McKellen\u2019s\none-man show is a tribute\nto his 80th birthday and\n50 years of acting, with\nthe proceeds going to theatre charities. Well-versed\nin Shakespeare, Chekov\nand Beckett, McKellen\nhas also acted on the big\nscreen as Gandalf and\nMagneto. Throughout the\nshow, his passion for live\ntheatre and Shakespeare\nwas clear. However, whilst\nadvertised as involving\n\u201cTolkien, Shakespeare,\nOthers and YOU\u201d, the\nfocus of the show was\non Shakespeare and not\non the other aspects as\npromised.\nI was initially buzzing\nwith excitement, hoping\nthat he would shed some\nlight on his stint in Lord\nof the Rings. The show\nopened with McKellen\nreading a passage from\nTolkien\u2019s Lord of the\nRings, including his\nfamous \u201cYou shall not\npass!\u201d line. However, the\npassage was read a little\nquickly \u2013 at times, the\nwords melded into one\nanother, and it almost\nseemed like he was\nrushing through it. After\nthe short 10 minutes of\nTolkien and a few swings\nof his sword Glamdring\n(which was the highlight\nof the show for me!),\nMcKellen moved on and\nnever returned to Middle\nEarth.\nMcKellen went on to\ntalk extensively about\nhis personal life. He\ngrew up in Lancashire\nand was drawn to theatre\nfrom a young age, with\na penchant for Shakespeare\u2019s works. McKellen\nsoon realised that his\nenthusiasm for theatre\nwarranted his pursuit\nof acting as a full-time\ncareer. And that is what\nhe did, progressing from\nsmall local productions\nto the Royal National\nTheatre; McKellen went\non to win every major\ntheatrical award in the\nUK at least once. Whilst it\nwas interesting to find out\nmore about McKellen\u2019s\nstory, this section of the\nshow was perhaps more\ndrawn-out than required.\nThe second half of\nthe show focused on\nMcKellen\u2019s experiences\nof Shakespeare\u2019s works.\nMcKellen went through\neach of Shakespeare\u2019s\nplays individually, talking\nabout his own personal\nexperience and doing\nsnippets of his lines. This\nwould have been ideal for\na Shakespeare fan; indeed,\nmany members of the\naudience seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves.\nHowever, going through\nall sixty-six plays was a\nrather lengthy process.\nFor someone like me, who\nis not hugely well-versed\nin Shakespeare, many of\nthe quips and anecdotes\nwent over my head and I\nfound myself lost at times.\nOverall, I am glad to\nhave seen a household\nname like McKellen in the\nflesh. For the Shakespearean fan, this would have\nbeen an ideal evening; for\neveryone else, it may be\na struggle to engage fully\nwith the entire show.\n16\nA legend in the flesh - but this Tolkien fan was disappointed // Frederic Aranda\nA perfectly proper portrait\u2018til you look closer // WikiArt\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nElizabeth Thong\nArts Writer\nWhere?

An\nhonourable mention goes\nto Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary,\nwhich I\u2019ve watched a million times, and took a lot\nof strength for me not to\ninclude in this list \u2013 take\nfrom that what you want.\nfor not only Anderson, but\nfilm in general and I have\nsince re-watched it many\ntimes. I\u2019m sure everyone\nhas heard of it, but if you\nhaven\u2019t, I implore you\nto watch this immensely\nfunny, superbly acted and\nwonderfully attractive\nfilm.\nDr. Strangelove or:\nHow I Learned to\nStop Worrying and\nLove the Bomb\nI just love this film.\nI love it so much that\nwherever I move, the first\ndecorative effort I make\nmediate answer whenever\nanyone asks what my\nfavourite film is, and if\nsomeone ever asks what\nI think the greatest film of\nall time is, it\u2019s probably\nstill the same response.\nWith Peter Sellers taking\nthree major roles under\nhis wing, including the\ntitular role, you can do\nnothing but praise this\nversatile actor three times\nover. Wild from start to\nfinish and saturated with\nsome of the most absurd,\nbut genius, characters, this\ncold war satire released in\n1964 hasn\u2019t really aged at\nall and is still as hilarious\ntoday.\nMustang\nMustang is the very\nwell regarded first feature\nfilm of Turkish director\nDeniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven.\nThe shortest way to\ndescribe this film would\nbe to say think The Virgin\nSuicides, but better.\nThe story follows five\norphaned young sisters\nraised by their grandmother and abusive uncle\nin a conservative Turkish\nvillage. After being\ncaught playing with their\nmale classmates, they are\ndragged out of school,\nlocked inside the house\nand arranged to be married\noff oldest to youngest. As\nheart wrenching as it is\nwatching the childhoods\nof these independent\nyoung women being\nsnatched away, the film\nis scattered with some\nwarm, sometimes even\nfunny, moments and I\nfinished this film feeling\nincredibly touched.\nThe Before Trilogy\nComprised of Before\nSunrise (1995), Before\nSunset (2004) and Before\nMidnight (2013), I guess\nI\u2019m cheating by putting\nthe entire trilogy on\nmy list, but in my mind\nthey\u2019re not separate\n(although if I had to pick\none, Before Sunset would\ncome out on top). Starring\nEthan Hawke as Jesse and\nJulie Delpy as Celine, this\nis a story of how a chance\nand brief encounter permanently changed their\nlives. Both characters are\nso convincing and played\nso seamlessly that by the\nend of the trilogy, you feel\nlike you know them well,\ndespite the fact each film\nis only set over the course\nof a few hours, 9 years\napart. Lacking a central\nstoryline and focused\nentirely on the continuous\nconversation of these\ncharacters, you would\nthink it would be easy\nto get bored, yet I found\nmyself hanging onto\nevery word that was said.\nViolently romantic, it will\nmake you want to fall in\nlove and have someone\nfall in love with you.\nFrances Ha\nFrances Ha has to be\none of the most loveable\nfilms I\u2019ve ever seen.\nWith the wonderful and\nnaturally comedic Greta\nGerwig playing Frances,\na (not very good) dancer\nwith very little direction\nbut an admirable spirit\nfor life, this is the product\nfor a most endearing\nmain character. The film\nis simple, highlighted\nwith its black and white\ncinematography and not\nan awful lot of plot, but\nperfectly so. Watching\nFrances struggle through\nlife in New York, it has\nall the potential to be\ndesolate and depressing,\nhowever with her positive\nand bouncy personality\nyou find yourself laughing\nalong with her. I think it\u2019s\nfair to say that by the end\nof it I wanted to see life a\nlittle bit more like Frances,\nbut was also desperate for\na friend like her.\nISSUE 1730\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFILM\nCharlotte Arrand\nFilm Editor\nSaid poster plastered on my wall // Columbia Pictures\nKeep your hands off my lobby boy! // Fox Searchlight Pictures\nis plastering my gigantic\nfilm poster on the bedroom\nwall.

    "content": "Love, Me and Compost:Adouble bill of love and trash\nMTSoc and Dramsoc comes together for a night of... you guessed it, musical theatre and drama!\nT\neaming up for\na double-billed\nshow, our very\nown MTSoc and\nDramsochaveputtogether\nan original musical titled\nLove, Me, and an original\nplay titled Compost,\nthe latter of which was\nrecently performed at the\nEdinburgh Fringe Festival\nover the summer.\nLove, Me\nL\nove, Me displays\nthe relationship\nbetween Ivy\nand Bill, both\nat its beginning and its\nseemingly approaching\nend, spanning around a\ndecade, exploring the importance of loving oneself\nin maintaining strong interpersonal relationships.\nWriting an original musical is no small feat, so\nmassive congratulations\nto writers Chris Koray\nAraz, Fabiola Mann and\nAfkar Malik, all current\nstudents at Imperial.\nHowever, much as it\nsaddens me to admit this,\nthe music feels uninspired\nmore often than not.\nThis is both melodically\nand lyrically, with some\nextremely clich\u00e9 lines\nlike \u2018she is imperfect,\nbut I still love her\u2019. They\nsay one of the first rules\nto good creative writing\nis \u2018show, don\u2019t tell\u2019, but\nthe extremely literal\nlyrics leave little to the\nimagination. Throughout\nthe show, it feels like the\nspoken dialogue is much\nstronger than the lyrics\nin progressing the story.\nAlthough the intentions\nbehind portraying Ivy\u2019s\ninner voice (simply called\nVoice, portrayed by Tash\nCowan) directly are clear,\nthe character is often ir-ritating, overly dramatic,\nand turns \u2018show\u2019 to \u2018tell\u2019\nconsistently, taking away\nany room for individual\nthought processing on\nthe events of the musical.\nCowan does her best\nwith the character, but\nthe writing lets her down\nconsiderably. Indeed, a\nvital issue with the writing\nis the one-dimensionality\nof pretty much every\ncharacter. This includes\nIvy, the central character\nof the plot. At least we\nget to see her wonderfully\nacted by Ellie Morgan and\nVasiliki Kalogianni in two\ndifferent periods of her\nlife.\nThe singing and acting\nare both very strong\n\u201cOne of the\nhighlights\nof the show\nwas when\nthe guitarist\ndropped his\nsheet music\u201d\n\u201c...the play is\nmuch deeper\nthan funny\none-liners, as\nit is, at its core,\nan exploration\nof corruption\u201d\nacross the board, and\nthe orchestration is well\nbalanced and full-bodied,\nhelping to elevate the\nscore. Well, for the most\npart anyway. One of the\nhighlights of the show\nwas when the guitarist\ndropped his sheet music,\nand had to sit there in\nawkward silence, waiting\nfor an appropriate time to\npick it up from the floor.\nThe direction and the\nlighting are also strong,\nwith one complementing\nthe other, often amplifying the funny and heartfelt\nmoments from the script,\nwhich would otherwise\nhave gone unnoticed by\nthe audience.\nThere are some musical\nhighlights, namely a\nwaltzy tune halfway\nthrough performed by\nIvy (Morgan), which is\nas close as the show gets\nto feeling complete, both\ntechnically and plot-wise,\nand the finale, which is\npredictably cheesy, but\ncute regardless. Successfully driving home\nits message of self-love,\nthe final song and its\npresentation are effective.\nAlthough the song is very\nquick to make its point, it\nis overly long, repeating\nitself time and time again,\nnot adding anything new\nto what has been said in\nits first minute.\nOverall, Love, Me is en-tertaining, well-acted and\nmakes its point heard loud\nand clear. The writers have\nachieved the extremely\ndifficult task of writing\na complete musical from\nscratch, which I applaud.\nHowever, the production\nfalls short in its writing,\nwhich lacks the subtlety\nneeded to be more than\njust entertainment.\nCompost\nW\nritten by\nC a l u m\nDrysdale,\na n o t h e r\ncurrent Imperial College\nundergraduate, Compost\ntells the tale of two\nex-government workers\nwho attempt to scam the\nwealthy homeowners of\nAmersham, by selling\nbins that supposedly turn\nplastic into compost.\nThe acting in Compost is\noutstanding. Specifically,\nthe manic personality of\none of the con artists (Ben\nHayward) which very\nsucessfully complements\nthe self-assured demean-our of his co-worker\n(Vaisnavi Ravichandran).\nColm Gleeson, a new\naddition to the cast after\nthe end of the sucessful\nEdinburgh run, replacing\nPrithu Banerjee, plays one\nhell of a drag queen. He\nis wonderful, delivering\nan extremely high-energy\nperformance that elevates\nthe play every time he is\non stage.\nThe play caters towards\nmillennials, referencing\nthings like Britney Spears\u2019\nmental breakdown in\n2007 and Kim Possible.\nHowever the play is\nmuch deeper than funny\none-liners, as it is, at its\ncore, an exploration of\ncorruption, which feels\nextremely relevant in\ntoday\u2019s political climate.\nThe audience is left to\nponder over possible\nparallels to current affairs.\nLuckily the play never\ntakes itself too seriously,\navoiding falling into the\npitfall of earnestly trying\nto push a message, prefer-ing instead to simply have\nchoice of music (mostly\nearly-2000s pop tunes)\nis also extremely smart,\nfurther adding to the \u2018millennial\u2019feel and sprinkling\nmoments of lighthearted\ncomedy in what is often a\nlot to digest.\nThe play is extremely\nfast paced, and quite\nconfusing at times. I think\nit suffer slightly from the\nlength of time that it has\nbeen running, begining\nwith previews in mid-Au-gust and only just coming\nto an end now. The play\nhas clearly undergone a\nlot of development and\nwhile no doubt everything\nmade sense to the cast, we\nthe audience felt a bit left\nbehind.\nJust when everything\nstarts making sense (if I\ncan reasonably use the\nword) the bonkers ending\nupset everything. Really.\nI can\u2019t quite describe it,\nbut I can reassure you that\nwhatever it is that happens\nis incredibly funny.\nCompost is extremely\nentertaining. Its abstract\nnature is at times a bit\nmuch, but at its best,\nit is simultaneously\nlaugh-out-loud funny and\nthought-provoking. At its\nworst, it goes slightly over\nthe top and tips into being\nconfusing.\nColm Gleeson as the drag queen medium(L) Maddie Roche as the eccentric horticulturalist (R)// DramSoc\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019\n18\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nWhere?

I think that it\u2019s\none of the oldest and most\nenduring quiz shows out\nthere. Unlike other shows,\nit\u2019s only students, in a\nteam of four, representing\ntheir university, competing against other students\nfrom other universities.\nIt\u2019s a buzzer race against\nthe other team for a notorious \u201cStarter for Ten\u201d\nfollowed by three bonuses\nas a team, a format that\nsets it apart from The\nChase, Mastermind, and\nother quiz shows. Roger\nTilling\u2019s voice saying\nthings is also notorious\n- there\u2019s a weird cult following around the show\nfor sure, and it\u2019s even had\na film based on it.\nWhat was the experience like, under the\ncameras and under\nfire from Jeremy Paxman, the host?\nCM: You kind of forget\nabout the cameras after\nfive minutes, and then\nit becomes like another\nquiz. You do see the\nclose-up camera on your\nface turn on and you think\n\u201cGod what does my face\nlook like, better not do\nsomething stupid\u201d but\nthen you get into a rhythm\nof it. It was just a fantastic\nexperience, and everyone\nshould try out for it.\nJeremy Paxman is a lovely\nman; we got to meet him a\nbit outside of filming and\nhe\u2019s definitely very nice. I\nthink people like to think\nof those clips from the\nshow where he acts like\nsomething very obscure\nis obvious, but when you\nget talking to him he\u2019s\ndefinitely a really nice\nguy. So is Roger Tilling\nfor that matter, such an\nodd experience to put a\nface to that voice.\nWhat were the trials\nlike and how are you\nrunning them this\nyear?\nCM:Trials were fine. Most\nuniversities have a very\nsimilar selection process\nwith a handwritten test\nand then a buzzer round.\nI\u2019d done buzzer quizzes\nbefore but University\nChallenge is special and a\ndifferent flavour so it was\nnice to get a shot at what it\nwas like.\nWe\u2019re going to hold\nround 1 trials of reading\nout many questions with\npeople writing down the\nanswers to see who knows\nwhat, before inviting back\npeople who score well and\nhave a good knowledge\nbase for a buzzer practice\nin various teams before\ncombining four people\nand one reserve to make\nthe team; it\u2019s not necessarily the four highest scores\nbut the team with the best\nsubject spread, so if you\nthink your skills like in\na particular niche even if\nyou don\u2019t think you may\nbe one of the four best\nyou might find yourself\non the team and off to\nplay against Manchester,\nEdinburgh, UCL, and\nOxbridge!\nHow did you train as\na team?\nCM: \u201cTrain\u201d is a very\nstrong word - at the end\nof it you have got to love\nspending a lot of time on\nWikipedia or elsewhere\njust generally reading\nabout things other people\nmay find silly, so it\u2019s\nmainly people with really\nstrong and general interests that do really well\non the show.

We did\nalso have a think about\nwhat weaknesses we had\nas a collective group, and\ntried to brush up on those\nsubjects too.\nWhat advice would\nyou have for people\nwho really want to be\non the show?\nCM: Have fun with it; you\ncan work really hard and\nwrite notes, and sure it can\nhelp a bit, but at the end of\nthe day the people who do\nwell and get on the show\njust love learning and\nreading things and enjoy\nit, getting into Wikipedia\nholes - that has to be\nsomething that sounds\nappealing to you to be a\nreally good contestant.\nAlso come to trials (you\ncan\u2019t get on the show\notherwise) and the Buzzer\nPractices that QuizSoc\nrun to improve that speed-based side of things!\nCatch Conor and the\nrest of their team\u2019s episode\nas it airs at 8.30pm on\nMonday 21st October \u2013\nit will be screened at a\nspecial event in FiveSixEight!\nRound 1 of Trials will\nbe held on 30th and 31st\nOctober at South Kensington Campus (location\nTBC).

One of the most\nfamous incidents was\npublished in the Daily\nMail in October 1929,\nwhen students attempted\nto capture Phineas (Uni-versity College London\u2019s\nmascot, a wooden effigy\nof a kilted Highlander,\nstolen from a shop outside\nTottenham Court Road in\nMarch 1900). The article\nread: \u2018A dilapidated motor\ncar containing [Phineas]\nwas last night pushed\ninto Downing Street and\nleft in front of No. 10\u2019\nand added that it \u2018looked\nas if it had come from\na rubbish dump\u2019. This\nrivalry between universities has since died down,\nand most of their Mascots\nhave retired to glass\ndisplay cases. However,\nthe tradition is very much\nstill alive at Imperial,\nwith there being several\nincidents a year.\nTo kick off the sport\nthis year, the pesky scientists of the RCSU stole\nour \u2018Spanner\u2019 and \u2018Bolt\u2019\non Monday. I must admit\nthat I had a part to play in\nthis; earlier that day I let\nthe RCSU President, Alex\nAuyang, into the Guilds\noffice under the guise of\n\u2018friendship\u2019. By the time\nhe left, he had gotten hold\nof my key card, only to\nuse it to return and swipe\nthe mascots while I was at\nFiveSixEight with a few\ncommittee members.\nWe returned to CAGB\n350, finding it strange that\nthe lights were already\non. It didn\u2019t take long\nfor us to notice that our\ndisplay case, which once\ncontained our pride and\njoy \u2018Spanner\u2019 and \u2018Bolt\u2019,\nwas empty, and a note left\nin their place. We were\ndevastated, and the RCSU\nmemorabilia scattered\naround the office (includ-ing a tie and a Freshers\u2019\nhandbook) really drove\nthe point home that they\nhad violated our mascots.\nPanic ensued on\nthe Guilds Committee\nFacebook group chat once\nwe broke the news to\nthem. Various methods of\nretrieving \u2018Spanner\u2019 and\n\u2018Bolt\u2019 were suggested,\nthrough both legal and\u2026\nless legal means. After a\nlot of discussion, it was\ndecided that we would\nsteal the Davy lamp in\nthe hopes that we could\nransom the Miners to steal\nback our mascots from the\nScientists, or at least, we\ncould offer them a fair\ntrade.\nThe plan was set.\nDuring Union Council the\nfollowing evening, when\nit would be guaranteed\nthat Chris would not be in\nthe RSM office, we were\ntostealDavyandstorehim\nin an undisclosed location.\nThe raid, needless to say,\nwas successful and as of\ntoday the lamp remains\nin our possession. As it\nstands, the scientists still\nhave our mascots in their\npossession and with our\nWelcome Dinner next\nweekend, we are very\nkeen to get them back. The\nstory is still unfolding, so\nmake sure you keep up to\ndate with our escapades\nthrough our social media\nchannels as well as in next\nweek\u2019s column.

I\u2019m very\npleased to say one of the\nvery few who needed\ntaking home was an older\nyear.\nThe fortnight continued in lavish, unrivalled\nICSM style at a range of\nother events spanning\nthe two weeks.

    "content": "NEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nO\nur reporters\ng e n e r a l l y\nnoted several\nthings.\nFirstly, there were a\nvery high \u2013 even a vast\nmajority \u2013 of students\nwho seemed unaware of\nthe allegations against\nthe Prince and thus were\ninitially confused by the\nquestions asked. This\ncould be interpreted as\neither apathy, or a lack of\nknowledge. There have\nbeen speculations among\nUK commentators that\nthe mainstream media has\nsuppressed the news to\nsome degree; this could\nbe an explanation.\nThere were a variety\nof responses from students who were aware.\nThese ranged from\ncondemnations to a complete lack of concern \u2013 the\ndiversity was very broad.\nSeveral responses took\nthe perspective that the\nPrince is \u2018innocent until\nproven guilty\u2019 and that\nthe College, as a result,\nshould act as if he is inno-cent. Indeed, the College\u2019s\nreticence to comment\ndirectly on the Prince\u2019s\nvisit (as opposed to the\nevent itself) seems to\nmatch this perspective. As\none reporter put it, \u201cthat\u2019s\nImperial in a nutshell \u2013\ntrust in institutions.\u201d\nThere were a few\nrespondents who deemed\nthe visit \u201cfor the greater\ngood of the university\u201d, in\norder to provide students\nwith entrepeneurship. One\nrespondent in particular\ntook this view until the\nextent of the allegations\nwas explained, and then\nonce informed stated that\nthey disapproved of the\nvisit.\nThe number of students\nwho actively opposed the\ndecision was fewer than\nexpected, but significant.\nOne student explained that\nthey didn\u2019t disapprove\nbecause they didn\u2019t feel\nthat the College hosting\nthe event amounted to an\nendorsement of Prince\nAndrew or Pitch@Palace.\nHowever, others disagreed and considered the\ndecision highly controversial \u2013 and stated explicitly\nthat they felt it did amount\nto an endorsement.\nLastly, there were\nstudents who simply\nseemed torn. Many of\nthese seemed to fall into\nthe \u2018innocent until proven\nguilty\u2019 camp, but felt\ninherently uncomfortable\nwith the situation.\nThe lack of consensus\nshows how prickly the\nsituation was; and how\nstudents need to converse\nabout these issues in order\nto increase awareness and\nreach their own conclu-sions.\nEditor\u2019s Note:\nOne aspect of the conversation I feel has gone\noverlooked is the College\u2019s abysmal response.\nOne can argue either way\nthat the decision to host\nthe event and the Prince\nwas acceptable or not.\nWhat is not acceptable\nwas the College statement\non the matter.\nFelix explicitly asked\nthe College about the\nmessage that the decision\nmight send to young\nwomen, the College\u2019s\nthoughts or priorities in\nthat type of decision-mak-ing, and how they plan\nto address those feelings.\nThey completely ignored\nthose questions.\nA stance such as\n\u2018innocent until proven\nguilty\u2019 would have been\na perfectly acceptable\nresponse, whether one\npersonally agrees or not.\nEven refusing to comment\non innocence or guilt\ndirectly, but providing\nsome reasoning for the\ndecision, would have\nsufficed. What does not is\ndisregarding the question\nand spending the entire\nstatement boasting about\nthe entrepreneurial\nbenefits, with not a whit\nof concern expressed for\nhow it may make students\nfeel. I personally feel\nthat the impact on young\nwomen at the College was\nnot considered at the time\nof the decision, or really\nsince.\nIndeed, the statement\ngiven originally was\nalmost purely about\nentrepreneurship \u2013 a\nspokesperson had to send\na follow-up email the next\nday with a tidbit about a\n\u2018code of conduct\u2019 external\nevents must follow on\ncampus. To me, this just\nreinforces the impression\nthat the feelings of students were not important\nenough to the College to\nfactor into the decision.\nIt was, at best, an after-thought. The priorities of\nthe College were made\nquite clear \u2013 and this\nis what I find to be the\ntravesty.\nThe College needs\nto restructure its deci-sion-making process so\nthat decisions are not\nmade in isolation, but\nwith a holistic sense of\nthe situation and the\naffected stakeholders.\nThis can be provided by\nintegrating more conversation between different\nCollege divisions into the\ndecision-making process.\nThey also need to commit\nto transparency with their\nstudents \u2013 that much is\nvery clear.\nPrince Andrew's Visit: Student Responses\nISSUE 1730\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLastweek,FelixreportedonPrinceAndrew\u2019svisittotheCollegeaspartofthePitch@Palacecampaign.Asthenews\nbroke, we spoke to students around campus about their opinions, and promised to report back.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\n8\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUnited States Supreme Court Weighs New LGBTQ+\nRights Cases\nThree cases will decide whether LGBTQ+ Americans have any protection from discrimination in employment\nPOLITICS\nAlex Hodges\nPolitics Writer\nP\nrotection from\ndismissal on\nthe grounds of\nsexual orientation\nor gender identity was\nup for debate before the\nUS Supreme Court this\nweek, in the first three\nLGBTQ rights cases of\nthe last 2 years. The cases\nreferenced Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act, which\nbans discrimination in\nhiring, pay, and dismissal\non the basis of an individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion,\nsex, or national origin.\u201d\nTitle VII became law\nin 1964, well before the\ngay rights movement, so\nLGBTQ+ people were\nnot explicitly protected.\nSince, rights for LGBTQ+\npeople have been executive policy and so\nhave varied; the Obama\nadministration issued a\nmemo advising the Justice\nDepartment that Title VII\napplied to transgender\nworkers, advice reversed\nby the Trump administration in 2017 along with a\nwider push-back against\ntransgender people\u2019s\nrights. Since 28 states\nhave no local protections\nfor LGBTQ+ people,\nthese varying federal\nguidelines remain the only\nlegal defense against dis-crimination. This week\u2019s\ncourt cases will finally\ndefine LGBTQ+ peoples\u2019\nfederal rights.\nTwo of the cases are\nsimilar and relate to employment rights for sexual\norientation. Bostock\nv Claymore County\nconcerns a court official,\nGerald Bostock, who\nworked with exemplary\nrecordsfortenyearsbefore\ncoming out by joining a\nlocal gay softball league.\nHe was promptly fired\nfor \u201cconduct unbecoming\nof a county employee.\u201d\nClaymore county alleges\nthat Bostock abused\ncounty funds, but did not\naccuse Bostock until after\nhe filed his complaint.\nThe second case, Zarda\nv Altitude Express Inc,\nreferences a skydiving\ninstructor, Donald Zarda,\nwho claims he was fired\nfor not conforming to the\n\u201cstraight male macho stereotype\u201d after a customer\ncomplained.\nAlthough sexuality is\nnot directly mentioned\nby Title VII, Zarda and\nBostock\u2019s lawyers claim\norientation is still protect-ed. Their clients\u2019 behavior\n\u2013 being attracted to other\nmen \u2013 would not have\ncaused their firings if they\nwere women. Therefore,\ntheir firings constituted\nsex discrimination and\nbreach Title VII. Employers, however, have maintained that such a change\nin interpretation is judicial\noverreach and should be\nwithin the purview of\nCongress instead.\nThe third case, Harris\nFuneral Homes v Equal\nEmployment Opportunity\nCommission, involves\nAimee Stephens, a transgender woman. After\nworking with the funeral\nhome for six years, she\ncame out as trans and\nwas fired two weeks later.\nHer lawyers argue that\nshe was discriminated\nagainst on the basis of sex\nbecause she failed to fit the\nstereotypes of her biological sex. Previously, the\nSupreme Court has held\nthat employers cannot discriminate against women\nfor being insufficiently\nfeminine. Therefore,\nsince Stephens was not\npresenting as sufficiently\nmale (i.e. conforming to\nher biological sex), she\nshould not have been discriminated against either.\nAgain, in oral arguments\nHarris Homes argued that\nextending protections to\ntransgender people would\nbe overreach, since they\ncontend Congress has the\nexclusive right to update\nthe Civil Rights Act\u2019s\nmeaning.\nUnlike other LGBTQ+\nrights cases, religious\nfreedom has not been a\nprimary issue, despite\nBostock\u2019s employer being\nrepresented by the Christian nonprofit the Alliance\nDefending Freedom, an\nLGBTQ+ people would\ncause \u201csocial upheaval.\u201d\nBoth liberal and conservative justices referenced\ntransgender peoples\u2019\naccess to bathrooms, due\nto disputed concerns of\nviolence from allowing\nbiological men into\nwomen\u2019s environments.\nThis topic is a touchstone\nof the American debate\non transgender rights, and\nwas mentioned despite\nbathrooms not being\nexplicitly linked to any\nof the three cases being\nconsidered.\nHow strongly the Court\ndefers to Congress will\nbe influenced by Justices\nKavanaugh and Gorsuch,\nthe two Trump-appointed\njustices seen as conservative picks that shifted the\ncourt to the ideological\nright. Since the retirement\nof swing vote Justice\nKennedy, the Court\u2019s\nopinion on LGBTQ+\nrights has been especially\nunclear; this case will\nshow how far the Court\u2019s\nopinion has shifted.\nWhatever the result,\nthe outcome of these three\nBaltimore pride // Flickr\n\u201cThese federal\nguidelines\nremain the\nonly legal\ndefense\nagainst\ndiscrimination\u201d\norganization designated\nby the Southern Poverty\nLaw Center as an an-ti-LGBTQ+ hate group.\nRather, the three employers are arguing that it is\nlegal to dismiss people for\ntheir sexuality or gender\nidentity for any reason.\nThe Court spent a\nsignificant amount of\ntime discussing whether\na change in the interpretation of the law to cover\ncases will affect the lives\nof millions of Americans,\nwhether or not they\nidentify as LGBTQ+. If\nthe Court finds in favor\nof the employers, similar\narguments could be\nmade across a range of\nother anti-discrimination\nlaws, opening the way to\nLGBTQ+ persons losing\nequal access to housing,\neducation, and sports\nevents. Furthermore, dismissal for not conforming\nto gender stereotypes\nwould become legal,\nallowing more forms of\nsex discrimination, such\nas penalizing men who\nare the primary carers for\nchildren, or women who\nare the primary source\nof income for a family.\nHowever, if the employees\u2019 complaints are\nupheld, then LGBTQ+\npeople in 28 states would\ngain certainty about\ntheir legal position and\nprotection in employment\nlaw, with more defined\nprotections in other areas\npossibly following.\nWhite House rainbow for SCOTUS ruling on same-sex\nmarriage (2015) // Wikimedia Commons\n\n"

It shapes\nmore than just our economic life but encroaches\non our politics, our cli-mate, our culture, our very\npsychology. Although it\ndictates our lives, it can\nstill remain a mystery to\nmany of us, with many\nkey ideas locked away\nin dusty tomes from the\n19th or 20th centuries.\nIn this series, I hope to\nmake these ideas more\naccessible and answer\nthe question: What is\nCapitalism?\nchair factory. They agree\nto pay you \u00a310 per hour of\nyour working time. This\ntime is where you use your\nlabour power to perform\nlabour. It doesn\u2019t matter\nare contributing exactly\n\u00a310 an hour of value, the\nemployer is not making\na profit or a loss \u2013 they\nmay as well do nothing.\nThis leads to a logical,\nyet stunning conclusion:\nyou are contributing more\nthan \u00a310 an hour of value\n(say \u00a325 an hour), and the\n\u2018surplus value\u2019 (\u00a315 an\nhour) is being pocketed\nby the employer as profit.\nThis profit was generated by the worker yet is\nkept by the employer who\nhas performed no labour.\nThis idea of surplus value\ndoesn\u2019t just apply to factories and the manufacturing industry, but to all\nindustries. Whenever you\nare working a job, you\nare generating more value\nfor the company than the\ncompany is paying you (if\nthis were false you would\nno longer be working\nthere!). This value is then\ntaken by the owners of the\nbusiness, i.e. the share-holders, as dividends.\nShareholders hold shares\ndue to their investments\ninto the company, and\ntheir ability to make\ninvestments comes from\ntheir wealth: that is to\nsay, capital. These are the\ncapitalists that give their\nname to capitalism.\nEconomists have come\nto differing moral judgments on this relationship.\nSome describe it as fair,\narguing that the profits are\nwell deserved rewards of\ncapitalists who have taken\na risk by investing their\ncapital into a business, and\nthat as workers enter into\nwage labour \u2018voluntarily\u2019,\nit cannot be called unjust.\nMany others argue oth-erwise, identifying wage\nlabour as an exploitative\nsystem where capitalists\nleech off labourers, who,\ndue to socio-economic\nfactors arising from other\naspects of capitalism,\nhave no choice but to\nperform wage labour to\nsurvive.\n\u201cThe preeminent\naspect of\ncapitalism\nis the\nrelationship\nbetween\na worker\nand their\nemployer\u201d\nThis is where the idea\nof economic class comes\nAmazon warehouse // Flickr\n\u201cEconomists\nhave come to\ndi\ufb00ering moral\njudgements\non this\nrelationship...\nSome describe\nit as fair... Many\nothers argue\notherwise\u201d\nin: capitalists are, by defi-nition, an elite minority\nclass, and workers are\nthe subjugated majority\nclass. Critics of capitalism\ndefine the working class\nas the group of people that\nhave no wealth/capital to\nlive off and are thus are\nmade to sell their labour\npower to survive and\nmeet their material needs.\nMeanwhile the capitalist\nclass have wealth, and\ncan use that wealth to\npurchase land, factories,\noffices, commodities.\nThese things are what\nlabourers work with in\norder to produce goods\nand create services for the\ncapitalist to sell, and are\ncollectively referred to as\nthe \u2018means of production\u2019\nand are owned by the cap-italist, not the worker. By\ninvesting capital, hiring\nworkers, and the surplus\nvalue of the workers\u2019\nlabour as profits, the\ncapitalist can live off their\nwealth without having\nto perform any labour.\nThis is what divides the\nworking class from the\ncapitalist class.\nhow much or how well\nyou work, you get paid\na fixed wage. But why\nshould a company agree\nto pay you \u00a310 an hour for\nthe labour you perform in\nthat time? What\u2019s in it for\nthem?\nThe labour you perform\ngenerates value \u2013 in this\ncase, taking the raw materials (wood) and adding\nvalue to it by performing\nyour labour on it and\nturning it into a chair. The\nchair is worth more than\nthe raw wood because of\nthe work you put in to it,\nand now the employer can\nsell the chair for a higher\nprice. Every hour, you\nwork on chairs and add\nvalue to the wood. If your\nlabour is contributing less\nthan \u00a310 an hour of value,\nthe employer is making a\nloss by paying you \u00a310 an\nhour to work at the factory\n- they would simply\nterminate the contract\nand bid you adieu. If you\nIn the first segment of an 8-part political economic series: \u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d,\nwe look at wage labour and the class divide.\n7\n-While we have looked\nat the worker-employer\nrelationship in an isolated\nsense, there are further\nquestions to consider.\nWhy is wage labour\nviewed as an involuntary\naction? Where did the\ncapitalist\u2019s wealth come\nfrom? What does it mean\nfor capitalists to \u2018own the\nmeans of production\u2019?\nWhat role does the state\nplay in this? All this, and\nmore, will be answered in\nnext week\u2019s article, where\nwe will look at the concept\nof private property. Stay\ntuned!\n-The word itself makes\nus think of corporations\nand consumerism,\nmarkets and money. But\nthe pre-eminent aspect of\ncapitalism is the relationship between a worker\nand their employer. The\nemployer enters into an\nagreementwiththeworker\nwhereby the worker sells\ntheir labour power, i.e.\ntheir capacity to perform\nlabour, in exchange for\nmoney in the form of\nwages, whether they be\ndetermined on an hourly\nor yearly basis.\nThis relatively simple\nconcept is referred to as\n\u2018wage labour\u2019 by political\neconomists. However,\nthere are logical consequences to such a\nsystem that may not be\nimmediately obvious. For\nexample, let\u2019s say you\nwork for a company, at a\n\n"
