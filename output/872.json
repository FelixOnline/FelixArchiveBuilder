    "content": "Under construction\nDegree stop\non rents\nStudents who do not pay college accommodation bills\nnow risk not being allowed to continue their degrees.\nThe new provision, which was approved at the last\nGoverning Body, was described by College Senior\nAssistant Finance Officer, Malcolm Aldridge as 'a more humane way' of persuading students to pay.\nThere has always been a provision under college\nrules to withhold degree results until bills have been\npaid although not to withhold the degree itself. Mr\nAldridge told FELIX that this had meant that debts\ncould remain uncollected for two years. He believes\nthat threatening to stop a student continuing his or\nher course will encourage more first and second years\nto pay. He estimates that there will be about ten degree\nstops in any one year.\nThe details are still being worked out, but Mr\nAldridge believes that students with unpaid bills will\nautomatically receive two reminders before any action\nis taken. A third reminder, usually sent out in the last\nweek of term, will include a warning that if the cash\nis not paid before the end of the summer vacation,\nthe student's degree will be stopped. He emphasised\nthat the residences are run as a 'commercial operation'\nand that debts, which account for between 1/2 and\n1 % of the residence turnover, must be recovered.\nStudents will be able to appeal to either the finance\noffice or to the registry if they feel that they have been\nunfairly treated. As a last resort, some departments\nmay be able to provide loans if they feel a student\nis of good academic standing.\nIt's that\ntime of year\nThis year's Imperial College Summer Fair will be held\non the Queens Lawn on Sunday 10th June. Entrance\nwill be \u00a31 for students and children and \u00a32.50 for\nothers. Tickets are available from the refectory and\nthe senior common room at lunchtimes.\nCareers\nmagazine\nImperial College Careers Service have launched a new\npublication, 'Student Newsbriefing'. Careers Adviser\nRuss Clark claims that the publication, which is still\nonly on trial, will contain 'news rather than teaching\nmaterial'. If it is successful, the Careers Service hope\nto sell advertising space within it to prospective\nemployers. Copies of 'Student Newsbriefing' are\navailable on departmental noticeboards or from room\n310 in the Sherfield Building.\nMore job advertisements will be available on the\nnewly installed hoarding s in the Junior Common\nRoom (JCR). The hording s are fully booked for the\nnext year and any profit made will go to Imperial\nCollege Union.\nImperial College Union's new barbecue cost almost\n\u00a3100 to build and then almost \u00a3150 to rebuild after\nUnion Deputy President decided to demolish it.\nWould-be architectural critics had succeeded in\nknocking holes in the original. \u00a360 of the money spent\non barbecue 2 went to pay a professional bricklayer\nto do the job properly. Doug King, speaking on behalf\nof the first construction crew, admitted that they had\nbeen 'pissed' but added that the barbecue had\nCharlies\nSecurity around the Southside halls of residence has\nbeen stepped up again in an attempt to stop people\nthrowing things from windows. Chief Security Officer\nGeoff Reeves told FELIX that in an incident on\nTuesday evening, a full champagne bottle, dropped\nfrom Southside had narrowly missed a passer by.\nSecurity guards will how go on one extra patrol a night. A memo has been sent to all Southside residents\ninforming them of the changes and warning them of\nthe consequences.\nGolden\nyears\nThe first generation of Imperial College chemical\nengineering students started their degrees almost 50\nyears ago and, the department claims, this makes it\nthe longest running course in the United Kingdom.\nThey will be marking the Jubilee by inviting as many\nas possible of the 2000 graduates to a celebration in\nmid-September 1990.

    "content": "Annual Report\u2014Wouter van Hulten, Overseas Students Officer\nThis report sums up most of the activity of the\nOverseas Students Committee during the year\n1989-90.\nNew Societies\nThis year, the constitutions of two new societies,\nIndonesian and Japanese Society have been agreed\nto by the Union Council, after operating for one year.\nBoth societies are running succes fully. Old Societies\nSeveral societies have not been organising activities.;\nBrazilian, Egyptian and Lebanese Societies were all not\nactive.\nAsian Society\nAsian Society, under the leadership of Bhartendu\nVyas, created at the end of 1988-89, has experienced\nsome hard times. Various allegations have been made\nat the Societies' Committee, contributing to the\nentertainment of the readers of Felix. The financial\ncontrol on the society is not 100% secure. The OSC\nhas decided that the society can only continue to\nreceive Union monies with a new Committee.\nChinese Society\nChinese Society also encountered allegations of\nkeeping an external bank account. However, this was\nbased on a mistake by the Bank, and the matter was\nsolved satisfactorily.\nInternational Night\nA lot of effort was put into the organisation of the\nInternational Night and this year's International Night\nhas been very successful, generating over 1000\npounds profit, compared to a loss in 1989.\nPublicity\nIn a UGM decision at the end of 1989, foreign\nlanguage was banned from all publicity posters put\nup around College. Only English language is permitted.\nIt is argued that, if foreign language were allowed on\nposters, many people would be excluded from\nknowing what was happening around College. This\nrule has certainly not been popular with the Overseas\nStudents Societies, many which have been fined\nbecause of it.\nHaldane Library\nFrom discussions with College and Union people, it\nhas been revealed to the OSC that during the Summer\nof 1989, Nigel Baker, then Union President, had\ninformed the Haldane Library that the Union would be\npleased to keep the Overseas Students newspapers\nsomewhere in the Union. These discussions\nproceeded without informing the OSC. The agreement\nhas never been minuted and can therefore not be\nverified. The Union has not made any facilities\navailable, though Neil McCluskey has given a lot of\nhelp in trying to find a solution.\nAt this time, the OSC has raised the matter at the\nCollege Committee on Overseas Students, it has\nmade the members of the College Student Welfare\nCommittee aware of it, and the OSC has written to\nthe College Librarian, Mrs Magda Czigany, asking the\nreturn of our newspapers to the Haldane Library. No\nreply has yet been received to this request. They just\ndon't give a shit.\nFinance\nThe OSC has now also introduced tighter financial\nbookkeeping measures, making it more difficult for\nSocieties to overspend.\nElections\nAndreas Massouras (Computing 2| is the new\nOverseas Students Officer. Roberto Siletti (Elec Eng\n2) is the new OSC Treasurer.\nWouter van Hulten Overseas Students Officer\n1989/90\nAnnual Report-Tim King, Recreational Clubs Committee Chair\nIt has been a vintage year for the RCC. In any other,\nthe 60th Birthday of the Gliding Club would have been\nthe pinnacle. Nick Lay has capped his high profile in\nthe Union with a great job as Captain, organising a superb Dinner with the guest list reflecting the high\nquality of Imperial graduates.\nHowever, the crowning glory has been the success\nof the Dance Club. Amanda Green, as President, has\ntirelessly worked to get the club to Florida, where they\nwon trophies in half of the competitions entered. This\nmirrored achievements in British events and the\ncompletion of a24 hour dance marathon.\nClive Dodimead has kept the RCC accounting system\n(as now used by all other MSC's) in good shape. We\nare now working on a database to manage non-financial information.\nThe RCC has introduced a Colours sub-committee to\nconsider 175-word written nominations and a supply\nof newly-designed ties is on order.\nThe current run of success in RCC management is\nfounded on strong continuity in the Exec. Next year,\nfor the third in succession, close personal ties through\nScout and Guide Club or Mechanical Engineering are\npresent.\nChairman\nVice-Chairman\nHon Sec\nAsst Hon Sec\nTransport Officer\nClive Dodimead, Mech Eng IV\nAmanda Green, Mech Eng IV\nJim Tinnion, Physics III\nTim King, Mech Eng PG\nDave Jackson, Mech Eng III\nHowever, I wish to end by highlighting that our Senior\nTreasurer, John Harrison, continues to provide an\nexcellent supply of experience, despite his many other\ninterests.\nEnts\nWine tasting\nScanning through a restaurant wine list can be an\nextremely self-defeating experience which we all\nencounter some time or other. Instead of choosing a wine which compliments the meal we somehow end\nup with an unpleasant ten pound tipple. The truth is\nthat the majority of wines featured alongside\nrestaurant menus are drunk far too young. For many\nof us this is one of the few occasions on which we\ndrink wine. Perhaps not an impressive introduction?\nMost people take a little nudging to appreciate wine.\nHaving spent some of my childhood in France I vividly\nrecall the ever-present bottle of claret with every meal\nexcept breakfast. Despite my French background I barely drank until I was sixteen. The wine was merely\none of several efficient substances used to get drunk.\nThe final nudge came at Imperial when I risked a Wine\nTasting meeting. I was relieved to find that I recognised several members whom I knew weren't synonymous with 'boring'. In fact it was down to the\nbar afterwards to neck a couple of pints and chat\nPage 10\nabout the week's absurdities.\nThe concept of drinking first-rate wines with meals\nis unrealistic on a student budget. However, every\nTuesday evening the Wine Tasting Society sets the\nstage for you to taste a selection of eight wines under\nthe guidance of a guest speaker. Occasionally there\nare also blind tasting s which are my favourite events\nsince they offer the ideal opportunity to frater n is e whilst trying to determine as much as possible about\nthe wines from their appearance, smell and taste.\nImperial can boast an excellent competitive record in\nthis, further enhanced by the recent victory in the\nUniversity Wine Tasting Competition.\nThe outlook for next year looks promising since\nmany of the contacts with wine suppliers and\nspeakers have already been made. Perhaps you will\nflirt with the idea of starting Tuesday evenings tasting\nwine. I hope so.\nSteve Gargett, IC Wine Tasting Soc Treasurer.\nThe last Ents gig of the year will take place in the\nUnion Lounge on the last day of term (June 22)\u2014and\nwhat a gig it will be! We have two bands lined up, a disco till late, a happy hour from 8-9pm and a bar\nextension until 1am. The main band of the night is The Levellers. A folk y rock outfit with that Irish sound along the lines of The\nMen They Couldn't Hang and The Pogues. An\nexcellent band who have just released a new album\nA Weapon Called the World which will be one of the\nclassic LPs of all time. In the present rag g let a gg le hysteria created by certain music papers these boys\ncan do no wrong so put your fighting boots on and\nyour drinking trousers and haul ass over to the Union\nLounge tonight for 9pm Supporting these fu nster s is a new band doing the\nrounds called Boy, Girl Soup. They are a very new and\npromising act with a sublime collection of great pop\nsongs drawing from such talent as The Wonderstuff\nand the Hooch Gurus.\nEntrance to the evening's entertainment is now t but\nplease bring a Union card, preferably your own.\nThanks to everyone who has helped this year,\ncongratulations to Emma, Gwyn, Rufus and Andy and\nsorry Natasha and Louise. See you all then, or else,\nand at next year's Freshers' Week.\nBJ.\n\n"

    "content": "Union Welfare Adviser, Yve Posner, outlines the benefits you will and won't be getting over the summer and\nWelfare update\nThe aim of this article is to provide an update on the\nposition regarding some key welfare issues for\nstudents.\nHousing Benefit\nIt is 99.9% certain that the majority of students will\nno longer be able to claim Housing Benefit from\nSeptember 1 1990. The 0.1 % margin of doubt is due\nto the fact that the am mend ment s to regulations\nwhich will remove entitlement are yet to be laid before\nParliament. However as there is no legislation to be\npassed it is unlikely that the proposed am mend ment s will be changed even if the matter is debated in the\nHouse of Commons. Therefore we must assume that\nbenefit will not be available from next term and this\nneeds to be taken into account when looking for\naccommodation for next year. UK undergraduate\nstudents en titel d to a Local Education Grant will be\nable to claim a student loan of up to \u00a3460.00 in\nLondon (\u00a3420.00 outside London); however in most\ncases this will not cover the amount lost in Housing\nBenefit.\nThere are some groups of students who will still be\nable to claim Housing Benefit:\nt Single parent students\n\u2022 Students with disabilities\n\u2022 Students with non-student partners and/or children\nAlso if you claim Housing Benefit during the Summer\nVacation you will be able to claim benefit up to the\nbeginning of the Autumn Term (2.10.90). The\nessential condition is that you must be in receipt of\nbenefit or make a claim before 1.9.90 in order to\nqualify for a payment until 1.10.90.\nHousing Benefit claim forms for most London\nBoroughs are held in the Welfare Office as well as\nfurther information about how to make a claim etc.\nUnemployment Benefit/Income Support or 'Dole'\nThe am mend ment s to the Benefit Regulations also\napply to Unemployment Benefit and Income Support.\nUp until now students could sign on as unemployed\nin the Summer Vacation and claim benefit. From\nSeptember 1990 this will no longer be possible.\nHowever as with Housing Benefit a student who\nclaims UB/IS before 1.9.90 will be entitled to benefit\nup until the beginning of the Autumn Term.\nIf you have never claimed UB/IS before and want\nto do so this summer you need to follow these\nprocedures:\n1. Signing on-as soon as term ends (ie Monday\nJune 25) you should go to your nearest\nUnemployment Benefit Office to register as\nunemployed. Details of addresses can be found in the\nWelfare Office or telephone directory. At the UBO you\nwill see the new claims receptionist who will make\nan appointment for you to see the New Claimant\nAdviser. You will also be given form UB671 to\ncomplete which you must take to your interview.\n2. UB671 -this form has 27 questions to answer and\nis designed to test whether you are 'available for and\nactively seeking work'. If any doubts are raised by the\nPage 6\nway you answer these questions you may be refused\nbenefit. It is therefore essential that you take you time\nwhen completing this form. You should also bear in\nmind the following:\n\u2022 indicate both the type of job you would like and also\nwhat you would be prepared to accept.\n\u2022 where you are asked for the minimum wage/salary\nyou will accept, you should put the going rate for the\njob. If in doubt put 'the going rate'.\n\u2022 state that you will be flexible about hours and/or\nwhere you can travel to-you could say that you are\nprepared to travel to anywhere within reasonable\ndistance of your home.\n\u2022 you must indicate that you are prepared to take up\na suitable vacancy straightaway.\n3. Interview-at your interview with the New\nClaimant Adviser you will be asked what steps you\nare taking to find work and the adviser will make a note of your 'intended job search activity'. As a student you will be expected to consider 'all' types\nof temporary work even if it is badly paid. You will\nalso be told that 'job search activity' can be reviewed\nat any time. However for students making a short\nterm claim this is unlikely to happen.\n4. Claim for UB/IS -during your interview you will\nmake your claim for Unemployment Benefit on form\nUB641. You should also be given form B1 to claim\nIncome Support. Most students do not get UB\nbecause they have paid insufficient National Insurance\nContributions. If you are not automatically given a B1\nask fo one and say that you are a student. The\ncompleted B1 must be sent to the DSS Office\ncovering your address.\n5. Payment-Benefit is paid fortnightly by\nGirocheque. You will have to wait at least two weeks\nbefore your first payment. You will then continue to\nreceive benefit provided you sign on when required.\n6. Holidays if you are going abroad you will not be\nentitled to Benefit whilst you are away and you will\nhave to reclaim on your return. If you are going away\nin the UK you must go to the UBO and complete a to loans\n'holiday form' giving details of where you can be\ncontacted. You are expected to give an assurance that\nyou would cut short your holiday if offered a job.\nOverseas Students\nOverseas students from EEC countries and the\nfollowing non-EEC countries: Iceland, Malta, Norway,\nPortugal, Sweden and Turkey and eligible to claim\nHousing Benefit and UB/IS. Those overseas students\nwith settled status or right of abode can also claim.\nHowever these students will also lose entitlement\nwhen the changes to legislation become effective in\nSeptember 1990.\nHealth Benefits\nHelp with NHS prescriptions, sight tests, glasses and\ndental treatment is not affected by the changes in\nlegislation.\nHealth benefits are available to both UK and\noverseas students. The Benefits are means-tested (ie\nbased on income) and can provide full or partial help\ntowards the cost of treatment. To claim you need\nform AG 1, available from either the Welfare Office or\nyou local DSS Office. If you qualify for help you will\nget a certificate which lasts six months at the end of\nwhich you will need to reapply.\nOther Benefits\nFamily Credit-this benefit will still be available to\nstudents with children whose parents are in full-time\nwork (at least 24 hours per week). It is a means-tested\nbenefit and also classed as 'public funds' which\nmeans that some overseas student families are\nineligible to claim.\nChild Benefit, Disability Benefits (eg Mobility\nAllowance)\nThe rules for claiming these benefits are unchanged.\nThey are equally available to both UK and overseas\nstudents.\nIf you would like further information about any of\nthese benefits please call into the Welfare Office.\nHealth Care Abroad\nIf you are planning a trip to an EEC country this\nsummer you will be able to get free or reduced cost\nemergency medical treatment provided you are:\n\u2022 A national of the UK or another EEC country\n\u2022 A stateless person or refugee\nThe help only applies to treatment under state health\ncare schemes. In order to receive treatment you need\nform E111 which can be obtained from the Post\nOffice.\nPoll Tax\nMost students will have received their bills by now\nand have started to make payments. As Poll Tax was\nthe subject of a feature article in FELIX earlier this year\nI will not go into any detail here. If there are still\nproblems or queries please call into the Welfare Office\nor contact your Community Charge Office.\nAccommodation/Housing Rights\nThe IC Union Housing Rights Pack is available from\nthe Welfare Office or the Accommodation Office. If\nyou are looking for private rented accommodation you\nshould get a copy as it contains invaluable advice on\nfinding accommodation, signing a tenancy agreement\nand your rights as a tenant.\nSince the 1988 Housing Act came into force on\n15.1.89 the rights of private tenants including\nstudents have been considerably changed. The types\nof tenancy agreements that tenants now sign are far\nmore restrictive than those covered by the previous\nHousing Act. If you want to do something that is not\nincluded in the agreement then it is unlikely that the\nlandlord will agree to any changes after you have\nsigned it eg if the agreement does not include a notice\nto quit clause ie allowing you to leave before the end\nof the tenancy after giving one month's notice then\nyou will be tied to the agreement.\nIt is therefore essential to read over an agreement\nbefore you sign it and if there is anything that you\nare not sure about then seek advice l The Housing\nRights Pack contains details of organisations that\nprovide advice so make sure you get your copy.\nStudent Loans\nThe Education (Student Loans) Act comes into force\nin September 1990. It provides for interest free loans\nto be make available to undergraduate students\nentitled to a Local Education Authority grant. The loan\nwill not be given automatically but will have to be\napplied for. Application forms will be available in\nCollege. The 'claims' will be administered by a Government agency based in Glasgow. The amount\nfor 1990/91 will be:\n\u2022 up to \u00a3 4 6 0 for London students living away from\nhome\n\u2022 up to \u00a3420 for students outside London living away\nfrom home\n\u2022 up to \u00a3330 for student living at home\nFurther information about the scheme will be\npublicised as soon as it is available.\nYve Posner, ICU Welfare Adviser.\nPage 7\n\n"

    "content": "Has the art of creativity died at Imperial College? Kenan Ardali gives his views.\nMotivation\nThe problems of student motivation seem to be very\nmuch in the news lately. Naturally, departments\nwithin the College are concerned with student dropout and under achievement which correlate closely to\nthis lack of motivation. Indeed, it is fair to say that\na fair proportion of students who arrive with very good\nA levels and high expectations do underachieve at\nImperial. This is partly attributable to the unnatural\nenvironment of university life which demands self-motivation, discipline and dedication in a highly\nspecialised subject. What academics seem to overlook\nis that most fresh undergraduates do not fully realise\nwhat they are letting themselves in for. The strains\nof acc lim at is ation to campus life coupled with new\nlife experiences can affect a student's performance\nand outlook.\nHowever, what is under scrutiny here is Imperial\nand, in particular, its engineering courses. Why do\nmost students feel that if they could do it all again,\nthey would go elsewhere? Certainly, to some extent,\n'the grass is greener on the other side', but the facts\nspeak for themselves: many of Imperial's engineers\nchoose to turn their backs on at least three years of\ndedication on some of the toughest courses at one\nof the world's premier technical universities.\nWhy? Short- to mid- term financial gains are very\nlucrative in the City and, admittedly, engineering\nneeds a lift both in its rewards and status within British\nsociety, but the fact remains that students leave\nbecause they do not like 'engineering'. The\nengineering student is rarely 'engineering' at Imperial.\nRather, he is learning a lot of science with a fair\nsmattering of maths. Too much emphasis is placed\non number crunching and factual learning. Imperial has\nits proportion of narrow-minded bookworms who\nhave an innate ability to memo rise and analyse but\nnot to synthesis e. Almost superficial to our engineering courses is\nwhat engineering is all about: the process of individual\nand collective input through practical application. This\nwas what I naively expected engineering to be all\nabout. The so-called practical lab and project work are\non the whole outdated, uninspiring and far removed\nfrom industry. One is made to feel that no matter how\nhard one tries, it has been done better by someone\nbefore. One has no chance to assimilate and cross-relate material before more work comes piling in.\nThe student has no alternative but to rush work and\nkeep trekking the eternal treadmill of work. By the\ntime the student can input his own ideas, say through\na final year project, he has usually lost his drive to do\nso. It becomes impossible to take pride in one's vocation. Finally, the salt is scoured into the wound\nwith the nervous trauma of the dreaded exams: That\nwonderful week or fortnight preceded by the panic\nhours of revision, spent desperately cramming half-comprehended past questions which will hold no value\nlet alone interest for the sufferer beyond the day of\nthe examination.\nYes, the Imperial grail works for the blinkered\nstudent who loves and lives science and is happy to\ncontinue as such, but for most promising school\nleave rs, arriving bright eyed and bushy tailed with\nhopes of living full lives, it does not.\nSo, what can be done? The engineering\ndepartments have begun in their own uncoordinated\nways to make improvements. The Mechanical\nEngineering department seems to be taking the\ninitiative, nicknamed ME20O0, with a radical proposal\nto change their course in preparation for European\nunity. Chemical and Aeronautical Engineering will\nhopefully continue to strengthen their ties with\nindustry and the Continent through their various\nundergraduate projects. The Electrical Engineering\ndepartment, extolling their course's virtues of 'the\ntraditional, but very sound education', have\nnonetheless recognised the motivation problems of\ntheir students. The Head of Department, Professor\nAleksander, in conjunction with his colleagues, has\ntaken several positive steps forward in order to\nimprove the deteriorating situation. For example, fresh\nundergraduates will spend the last few days of\nfresher s' week discussing open-ended group design\nprojects intended to give the student some\nCome on kid, you can do it.\nperspective on the genuine need for engineering\nknowledge in industry and the real world.\nConsiderable time has been allocated to this project\nlater on in the year. This development will allow\nstudents to provide personal input from day one.\nAnother interesting development is the short term\nappointment of psychologist, Maureen Parr, who is\ncurrently looking at the possibilities of wider access\nfor engineering departments.\nMaybe part of the problem lies in the type of student\nwho becomes an engineer. Engineering is not and\nshould not be pure science. It is about being practical,\ncreative and objective in approaching real problems.\nHowever, inherent in our education system is a restriction on the pool of potential engineers. The\nsystem limits this reservoir exclusively to 'A' level\nstudents who have studied at least maths and\nphysics. There is a school of thought that proposes\nthat students who have limited themselves almost\nexclusively to scientific disciplines from the age of,\nsay, 16, are not sufficiently broad minded to be able\nto tackle engineering problems with creativity and\noriginality.\nAs a remedy, it has been suggested that engineering\ndepartments admit students with a broader range of\n'A' levels, with the engineering departments providing\nstudents having only arts 'A' levels with a preparatory\nyear of study that would bring them up to the levels\nof maths and physics required for an engineering\ndegree. This would provide a more varied cross-section of students and may attract a much coveted\ncommodity lacking at Imperial: women. As a means\nto the latter, the possibility of undergraduate degrees\nin humanities could be discussed.\nAlternatively, students could be instructed in\ncreativity techniques, such as brainstorming,\nsyne c tics, lateral thinking, etc. Such techniques have\nbeen proven to improve an individual's creativity and\nwill add to the individual's desirable skills, since most\ncompanies employ forms of idea generation and\nproblem solving techniques. The psychology and\napplication of creative thought is a fascinating area\nin itself but it also has numerous beneficial secondary\neffects: what better way to get to know someone\nthan to discuss a problem with them? How better to\nlearn about teamwork, communication and dealing\nwith people than through a problem solving session?\nIndeed, how better to get a person motivated in their\nsubject than giving them real problems to discuss in\ntheir subject area?\nSo come on Imperial, the ball is in your court. There\nare plenty of proponents for change, not just within\nthe student body. In adapting to the changing\nenvironment, we are lagging behind other countries\nand even our own polytechnics. Our courses are on\nthe whole too inflexible and archaic. Follow the\nexamples of other forward looking universities and\nrealise that you are not getting the most out of our\nmost precious resources: raw intellect, enthusiasm,\nyouth and hope.\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "LSO: Mahler Symphony No.2.\n'The programme notes are excellent,' Tilson Thomas\nsaid, 'but I'd just like to say a few words.' He then\ntalked at considerable length about the spiritual roots\nof the 'mystical' Carl Ruggles, whose three works,\nAngels, Organum and Exaltation, opened the concert.\nOnly eight pieces were published by this American\ncomposer, who destroyed much of what he wrote.\nAngels is for muted brass, all of which seem to be\ntrying to be as discordant as possible. The second\npiece is more harmonious, whilst Exaltation, a hymn\ntune written in memory of Ruggles' wife, is pleasant\nenough, but ultimately uninteresting. Tilson Thomas\nis obviously a Ruggles enthusiast, but his opening\nremarks were embarrassing and unnecessary.\nOn to Mahler's second symphony. Although the\nwork explores death, it is ultimately an optimistic\npiece concerned with the resurrection after the Final\nJudgement. The powerful and unsettling funeral\nmarch themes of the opening movement give way to\nrejoicing in the choral setting of Friedrich Klopstock's Resurrection Ode in the last movement.\nThis performance can only be described as\nmagnificent. Tilson Thomas coaxed the orchestra\nthrough the spectrum of sentiment found in the work\nand handled the sudden changes of mood and tempo\nwith a highly sensitive touch. The LSO exhibited their\nusual excellence, especially evident in such a demanding piece, with the brass section deserving\nSchool for Scandal\nConducted by M. Tdson Thomas\nspecial credit.\nOf the two soloists, the contralto, Alfreda Hodgson,\nstarted hesitantly and was disappointingly weak in the\nUrlicht section. However she strengthened in the\nFinale when accompanied by Alison Hargan, who\nsang the soprano part with passion. The London\nSymphony Chorus provided competent support.\nDragging the audience through the extremes of\nemotion contained in the symphony, the LSO certainly\ngave it an airing equal to its epic intentions. Their\nattack on Mahler's ninth symphony on June 10th should be eagerly anticipated.\nLiz W. Theatre\nA delightful evening at The Theatre begins with a crowd of seventeenth century socialites, spreading\nmalicious rumour, overlay ed with the amplified sound\nof whispering. Mrs Sneerwell (Jane Asher) and\nJoseph Surface, together with a Mr Snake, both\nintend to use lies and scandal to their amour o us advantage. But the plot thickens as we meet the other\ncharacters, with equally revealing names like Mrs\nCandour (Prunella Scales) and Mr Backbite. The very\ntools Surface and Sneewell are using backfire on them\nwith amusing consequences.\nRichard Brinsley Sheridan's classic restoration\ncomedy is well suited to the Olivier Theatre's stage\nand is brought to life with harmonic costumes, an\nimpressive set and highly enjoyable performances. His\nbitter-sweet satire and portrayal of sexual profligacy\nare just the thing for Londoners immersed in\nTwentieth Century excess. Flawless.\nThe School for Scandal is on at the National\nTheatre. The Olivier box office is on 071-928 2252.\nStudent standbys cost \u00a35.\nAdrian Pagan.\nWe're No Angels\nFilm Theatre\nSean Penn and Robert De Niro play a couple of Laurel\nand Hardy type criminals resigned to life inside a demeaning prison. When a condemned prisoner\nmakes his escape, however, they are inadvertently\nswept up into the jail break. If they're found, they too\nwill be executed by the sadistic warden. Luckily they\nmanage to hitch a lift into town with an old woman\nwho mistakes them for travelling priests. From the\ntown, all they have to do is cross the river (and the\nborder) into safety. Unfortunately they are again\nmistaken for real priests and are taken into the local\nmonastery. A blockade is put across the bridge and\nprison guards start a house to house search. From\ntheir hiding place, they plan a daring escape...\nAt this point you may be forgiven if you're thinking\n'Sounds like a Nuns on the Run rip off. This is\nunfortunate as many people may decide not to risk\nseeing the same film twice, whereas this film is\nactually completely different. Nuns on the Run is a straight comedy. 'We're No Angels' tends to be a thriller but with some comic patches.\nAt the beginning, inside the prison, with views of\nsqualid conditions, and brutal oppression leading to\na tense jail break, this seems like a normal thriller,\nsimmering nicely. Once outside though we wonder\nwhy the duo were in such a degrading place to start\nPage 4\nwith; they don't seem ruthless or intelligent enough.\nMaking the escapees fairly inept is supposed to offer\npotential for farcical situations to occur where a thriller\nmight have an explosion or two. This certainly cuts\ndown on costly explosions, but does it make a good\nfilm?\nThe combining of thriller and comedy is not\nattempted often, and this time the mix of genres tends\nto separate and become somewhat lumpy. Generally\nthe comedy involves the duo's mistaken identity,\npriest's vows (Demi Moore is the shapely temptress\nhere) and their lack of knowledge of church affairs.\nThis is often quite amusing, but it doesn't tie in well\nwith the thriller aspects of the hunt by the warden and\nthe third psychopathic escaped prisoner. This third\nman, an escaped killer, is put in some ludicrous\nsituations that, although amusing at the time, are\nunconvincing and weaken the film.\nPenn and De Niro play their parts well, but many\nof the supporting cast are more believable and could\nhave come from a serious drama. I feel that some of\nthe 'in-built' jokes such as the thick and dopey guards\nshould have been dropped, but the rest does not fail\nto please.\nToby Jones\nHanging the\nPresident\nMichele Celeste's powerful new play, first performed\nat last year's Edinburgh Fringe, seems to be on the\nfirst stage of a 'world tour'. Set in a condemned cell\nin a South African prison, the play presents a 'shit and\nall' view of the last hours of the lives of two white\nmurderers and the bizarre sexual power games they\nplay with the warder and with each other. They feel\ncheated that the (South African) President is allowing\nthem to hang: especially when a black political\n(prisoner) who is to be executed with them is flung\ninto their cell. They feel that that is the ultimate form\nof degradation.\nAs the time draws nearer their desperation\nincreases and drives them to extremes as they wait\nfor a reprieve. You cannot help being drawn into the\nintensity of this production which is admirably crafted\nby a powerful and fearless cast and although the script\nseems a little dated (after the events of the past few\nmonths) Hanging the President is a wrenching\ncommentary on apartheid and South Africa today.\nShockingly good.\nAdrian Pagan.\n\n"

The\nproduction company is seriously short of\nstaff and may have difficulty running the\nvenue which is already fully booked for\ntwo of the festival's three weeks.\nTWE have asked for volunteers to help\nconvert the venue, St John's Church, into\na viable theatre; to set up and control the\nlighting, to produce publicity and to man\nthe box office.

This, they felt, had put people\noff the society but said that things would\nbe different in future. They claim that,\nwith a full quota of helpers, individual\nvolunteers need only work a couple of\nhours a day making it an ideal opportunity\nto visit the festival cheaply.\nUnion manager resigns\nImperial College Union Manager David\nPeacock has resigned.

    "content": "The Package\nIf The Hunt For Red October was the last gasp of the\npre-Glasnost thriller, The Package is definitely part of\nthe inhalation of the new post-Glasnost thriller. The\nworld is on the verge of peace. The Russians and\nAmericans are about to sign a treaty that will end the\nnuclear threat, just in time for Christmas, the season\nof peace and goodwill to all men. Unfortunately\nvarious elements of the Armed Forces on both sides\nare none to happy about these developments. Well its\nreducing their job description isn't it? So they plan to\nassassinate one of the leaders. This is where Johnny\nGallagher (Gene Hackman) gets involved. He is\nordered to escort a 'package' (a court martialed serviceman) back to the good 'ole USA to serve time.\nOnce the arrive, Gallagher is assaulted in a men's toilet\n(isn't that a criminal offence?) allowing his package\nto abscond. Gallagher then chases up his ex-wife, a personnel officer, who discovers that the package\nisn't who they thought he was...\nThere is one problem with this film. In a thriller there\nneeds to be some element of doubt as to the outcome.\nWhen you are talking about the assassination of a Terry Pratchett has quite a pedigree; The Colour of\nMagic, The Light Fantastic, Equal Rites, Mort,\nSourcery, Wyrd Sisters and now the seventh in the\nline, Pyramids. Each received more acclaim than its\npredecessor, while the quality of the books decreased.\nThe trend continues.\nSet in a world where magic rules, the dawn drifts\nin and pieces of luggage have legs, anything could\nhappen. The world is a disc resting on the back of four\ngiant elephants which in turn stand on the back of a huge turtle, Great A Tuin (sex unknown).\nThe first couple of books follow Rincewind and 'The\nTourist' through perilous adventures that were\nnarrated in a friendly and subtle humourous way, the\njokes just happening naturally.\nIn Pyramids he has branched out, completely\ndeserting all of the original characters apart from\nDeath, and has traded the gentle humour for a more\nCreator\nPeter O 'Toole plays a British eccentric. This does not\ncome as a surprise, as that's what he does these days\n[High Spirits, Jeffery Bernard is Unwell). This time\nround his eccentricity manifests himself as a crusade\nto clone his dead wife. This he hopes to achieve in\nthe shed in his backyard, with equipment he has\nappropriated from the University at which he works.\nAdded to this is a randy new male undergrad assistant\nwhose hormones are busy in a pursuit of a young\nfemale. Mix in a self professed 19 year-old\nnymphomaniac who muses 'How can a man respect\na woman who comes five times between him ringing\nthe bell and her answering the door?' and a obnoxious\nfellow scientist (David Ogden Stiers from MM* S\"H, doing what he does best) and set the ball rolling.\nImprobable is perhaps somewhat of an\nunderstatement for this film, whose science is\nsomewhat dubious at best, including such gems as\nthe \"Love Formula\" which is subject to the\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The emotions are\neven worse, with the females in the cast falling in love\nbrutal 'I 've got a joke and I'm going to use it' style.\nThere are occasional glimpses of the old Pratchett but\nwith the majority of the puns and quips that he is\nfamous for found in the post-scripts the story flows\nalong like tar on a carpet.\nThe story is fairly standard for a Pratchett book, i.e. completely stupid and impossible, although it does\nhave more than a passing resemblance to Wyrd\nSisters.\nTeppic, who has trained as an assassin, becomes\nking of Djelibeybi a small kingdom with a fetish for\npyramids. During the building of the latest\nmonstrosity, the largest yet, weird and bizarre things\nstart happening. When the kingdom eventually\ndisappears into another set of dimensions he escapes\non the back of the best mathematician on the Disc.\nWhat follows is the script for what could have been\na brilliant book, exploding pyramids, walking\nworld leader there really isn't that much. Mind you this\nwouldn't be a problem if there was some sort of\nfeeling of suspense. There isn't. The plot is explained\nin little chunks and so we get a steady drip of\ninformation instead of one climatic revelation. The\nsuspense is missing, so one is left reclining securely\nin one's seat, not perched tension-ridden on the edge\nof it.\nBeyond that the film is technically sound, with\nimaginative cinematography and competent\nperformances, aside for one or two walking hams. Its\nnice to see a more mature leading lady, wrinkles as\nleast as prominent as those of Hackman, with little\nsign of the obligatory bimbo. Anti-Russian feeling is\nstill in evidence though as it is implied that it is their\noperatives that are the ring leaders. Aside from that\nis quite ideologically sound, for an American movie.\nA film that will make a nice evening's video\nentertainment, but which is not up to the full London\nentrance price, with better, similar films such as\nInternal Affairs about.\nAdam T. Book\nmummies (and daddies) and gods that come to life but\nrefuse to do what they are told. By being so blatant\nand obvious he manages to kill it.\nSomething I find hard to understand is why he has\nreceived such praise from the press. It's not the\nfunniest book ever, it didn't make me cry with joy and\nif it was the best British science fiction book of last\nyear the rest must have been very poor. At the\nmoment he appears to be living on his reputation but\nsoon that will dry-up.\nTo those who haven't read any Discworld novels\nbefore, start at the beginning and only graduate onto\nthe latter books if you love the style. If you are an\nardent fan then nothing will stop you, all I will say is\nthat hopefully he will see the errors of his ways and\ncorrect himself soon.\nIan Hodge\nFilm\nfor such diverse reasons as having an orgasm while\nan egg is removed or being told all night long that 'I mean, what girl wants a guy to spend all night long\ngoing over every part of her body just because it feels\ngood?'. The only moderately believable character is\nDr. Harry Wolper, and this is solely due to O 'Toole's uncommon talent, which lifts him far above the\nmediocrity of the rest of the cast.\nThe rest is pathetic sentimental ising and second\nrate blue movie, complete with neck licking and ear\nsucking. The entire thing seems to be single mindedly directed towards telling us that love is the 'Big\nPicture', ie everything, a message that has been told\nfar better in numerous other films. Sexist, emotionally\ndeficient and lacking in humour which is actually\nfunny, it should be perfect for the typical IC student.\nAdam T. Page 3\nPyramidsby Terry Pratchett\n\n"

    "content": "Chris Onof describes the repercussions of last year's events in Tiananmen Square.\nChina one year on\nPrisoner of conscience\u2014Wang Dan, once one of China's most wanted student leaders.\nOne year ago, on June 4, the whole world was\nappalled by the news from China; at least 1,000\npeople were killed that night as heavy troops moved\nthrough the streets of the city of Beijing and into\nTiananmen Square to crush the peaceful student\ndemonstration-charred protesters and onlookers\nwere killed at random, shot, crushed by tanks and\nbeaten to death.\nSince that day, unknown numbers of people have\nbeen executed there. The Chinese media have\nreported 6,000 arrests, but Amnesty International\nbelieves the true number to be in the tens of\nthousands; moreover it is believed many detainees\nhave been tortured.\nIn all cases, they will not have received a fair trial\u2014\nfor example, defendants often do not see a lawyer\nuntil right before the trial. The practice of 'verdict first,\ntrial second' is also common in China and has been\nacknowledged in the legal press. Moreover, some\nprisoners do not receive a trial at all since Chinese\nlaws permit detention without charge or trial for up\nto four years for 're-education through labour' for\nthose with 'anti-socialist' views.\nThese appalling abuses of human rights are not new\nin China-Amnesty has been concerned by such\nviolations of basic human rights in that country long\nbefore the Tiananmen Square massacre last June. For\ninstance, Prisoners of Conscience also include Roman\nCatholic priests accused of supporting Tibetan\nindependence and students and workers who were\nactive in the 'democracy movement' of the late\n1920s. In January of this year, 573 detainees were\nreleased, but these moves were seen as cosmetic by\nmany observers. Amnesty remains concerned about\nthe thousands of other people who are still in\ndetention today.\nAmnesty is appealing to all students in the UK not\nto forget their fellow students who died during the\nmassacre of June 1989. One way in which Amnesty\nInternational is asking students to become involved\nin this work is by campaigning for an individual\nstudent; Wang Dan.\nWang Dan is a history student at Beijing University\nwho. became a key figure in the pro-democracy\nmovement last spring. He was chairman of the\nStudent Society of Contemporary Social Problems and\ndeclared that he would never join the Communist\nParty because it d id not live up to his ideals.
