    "content": "'eat ure28 May 1993 Felix 968\nThe Journey of a Lifetime\nSacrifice and commitment as Rafi Shafi, of EEI, takes a look at the Hajj\naround it and their meaning.\nThe harmony of people and society\ncan be gained only through mutual\nunderstanding of other cultures.\nThis can best be achieved through\nthe effective and proper usage ofthe\ncommunication technology that has\nturned the world into a small\nvillage. Despite this it is a shame\nthat a religion that inspires over a billion people around the globe\ntoday has remained enshrouded in\nmystery and misconception. This is\nalso true, contrary to the\nexpectation, for a multicultural\nsociety such as Britain, where there\nare about 2 million Muslims. Today\none finds that people, even at\nImperial College, are unaware of\nthe feelings and celebrations of their fellow Muslim classmates and\nfriends. Therefore I invite you to\nread some of my thoughts\nconcerning the oncoming\ncelebration, the Celebration of\nSacrifice.\nMuslims believe that\nIslam is the final form of\nthe same Message that\nwas delivered to all the\nProphets.\nMuslims believe that Islam is the\nfinal form of the same Message that\nwas delivered to all the Prophets\n(may God be pleased with them).\nThe first man was Adam and who\nwas appointed as the first prophet.\nHe called people around him to\ntestify that there is only one God,\nthe Lord and Sustainer of the\nuniverse, and not to join partners\nwith Him. He warned mankind of\na Day that was approaching when\neverything in the universe would be\ndestroyed and man would be\nquestioned about his deeds in this\nlife. Then those who believed in\nGod and worked righteousness, not\njoining any partners with Him\nwould be sent to Paradise to enjoy\neternal peace and those who\ndisbelieved in Him, mocked at His\nsigns and worked evil would be sent\nto Fire.\nDuring the passage of time the\nMessage was corrupted and the\nchildren of Adam started\nworshipping other deities.\nTherefore God sent down other\nProphets to remind people of the\nMessage. Noah, Abraham, Moses,\nDavid and Jesus (may God be\npleased with them) were all\nmembers of this chain and\nMuhammad (peace be upon Him)\nwas the last link in this chain of\nprophethood. Naturally as a result\nthe source of information is unique.\nIt is not surprising that a number of\nhistorical events mentioned in the\nQur'an show a big similarity to the\nones in the Bible, albeit with some\ndifferences. Hence many important\nand sacred events and places for\nJews and Christians are also\nimportant and sacred for Muslims.\nThe Ka'bah in \"Mecca was\ninitially built by Abraham and His\nson Ishmael as the first house of\nworship for mankind. When\nMuhammad was appointed as a prophet, the Ka'bah had al read v been filled with idols. The pure\nmonotheistic worship had been\ncorrupted and people had started\nworshipping the idols within the\nKa'bah. Nevertheless, it was still an\nattraction point for many people\nfrom all over the Arabian\nPeninsula.\nMany important and\nsacred events for Jews\nand Christians are also\nimportant and sacred for\nMuslims.\nIslam cleared the Ka'bah from the\nidols and forbade idol worshipping.\nThe pilgrimage to Mecca was\nordered by God to be performed in\nthe same manner as Abraham\nestablished, solely for the pleasure\nof God. It is one of the pillars of\nIslam and it must be fulfilled by all\nthose who are able to undertake the\njourney. Today Muslims from all\nover the world come to Mecca at\nthe time of the pilgrimage in order\nto fulfil their duty, symbolising the\nunity of mankind whether they are\nblack or white. All are dressed\nidentically regardless of wealth. A head of state and a normal citizen\ncan not be distinguished during the\npilgrimage.\nToday, at this very moment\nmillions of pilgrims are praying to\nGod Almighty in Mecca. The\nharmony, beauty and unity of this\ngathering can only be described by\nthe people who have already been\nthere. The following is former\nboxer Mohamed Ali's description:\n7 have had many nice moments in\nmy life. But the feelings I had while\nstanding on Mount Arafat on the\nday of 'Hajj' (Arabic word for\nPage 10\nFelix 968\n'eat ure28 May 1993\n(the pilgrimage) the festivals\npilgrimage), was the most unique.\nI felt exalted by the indescribable\nspiritual atmosphere there as over\na million and a half pilgrims\ninvoked God to forgive them of their sins and bestow on them His\nchoicest blessings. It was an\nThe pilgrimage was\nordered to be performed\nin the same manner as\nAbraham established...\nexhilarating experience to see\npeople belonging to different\ncolours, races and nationalities,\nkings, heads of states and ordinary\nmen from very poor countries all\nclad in two simple white sheets\npraying to God without any sense\nof either pride or inferiority. It was\na practical manifestation of the\nconcept of equality in Islam'\nAt the end of this gathering\nMuslims sacrifice an animal (a sheep or goat) for the sake of God.\nThis is the day of celebration all\nover the world for Muslims. They\nvisit each other, re conciliating any\ndifferences, to tighten the bonds\nwithin society.\nLike their brothers and sisters in\nMecca, Muslims around the world\nalso sacrifice an animal on that day.\nThe animal sacrificed is\ntraditionally divided into three\nportions: the first portion is\ndistributed to the poor, the second\nis given to neighbours and friends\nin order to strengthen the\nrelationship between them, and the\nthird portion is for family members.\nThis may change since the whole\nanimal may be sent to poor people.\nA head of state and a normal citizen cannot be\ndistinguished during the\npilgrimage.\nFor example today in Britain, many\nMuslims are sending money for the\nsacrifice to needy, poor and\nstarving countries such as Ethiopia,\nSudan, Somalia and Bosnia through\ncharity organisations.\nThe sacrifice is not only about the\ndistribution of meat. \"It is not their\nmeat nor their blood, that reaches\nGod: it is your piety that reaches\nHim. He has thus made them\nsubject to you that ye may glorify\nGod for His guidance to you and\nproclaim the good news to all who\ndo good\" The Qur'an (22:37). The\nperfect example of this piety of\nsacrifice can be found in the\nProphet Abraham. He was\ncommanded to sacrifice his only son\nIshmael for the sake of God. The\nintegrity and purity of his intention\n...It was a practical\nmanifestation of the\nconcept of equality in\nIslam.'\u2014Muhamad Ali\npleased God and He sent down a sheep to be slaughtered on the place\nATTENTION ASTHMA\nAND HAY FEVER\nSUFFERERS.\nThe Clinical Studies Unit at the Royal Brompton Hospital is conducting a series of clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for asthma and hay fever\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THESE\nIMPORTANT STUDIES PLEASE CONTACT:\nSARAH AIRMAN\n071 351 8971 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday\n071 351 8976 24 hour answering machine.\n(Please leave your name, contact phone number, time and date.)\nAll trials are approved by the Ethics Committee\nof the Royal Brompton Hospital\nExpenses incurred when participating in clinical trials will be\nreimbursed\nof Ishmael.

The celebration is about\nsacrifice and indeed this is the entire\nessence of Islam in that you\nsacrifice your own whims and\ndesires and submit wholly and\nsincerely to the will of God. \"The\nReligion before God is submission\nto His will\" The Qur'an (3:19).\nAll praise is due to God the Lord\nand Cherisher of the universe.\nPage 11\n\n"

The\nresults were 233, 68 and 76\nrespectively. Mr Swan will now\ncontinue to represent St Mary's students in external affairs.\nOther election results saw the\npost of Vice President (Internal) go\nto Syed 'Mazza' Masud, beating\nHelen Snock by a margin of 245 to\n139. The Clubs Rep election was\nclaimed by Jon Houghton forcing\nAquel Jamil into the next best\nposition by a margin of 89 votes.\nThe crown of Welfare Rep was\nplaced on the head of Karen\nChumbley. Ms Chumbley won 199\nvotes, beating rival Nicky Wilson\nby 68 votes. The final position of\nAssistant Social Secretary saw\nAndy Wilks crossing the finish line\nin the most closely contested\nelection. Mr Wilks secured his\nposition by only 48 votes.\nAdditional celebrations have been\ntaking place at St Mary's as the\nMedical School's Music Society\nannounced its 1st Music Exhibition.\nThe prize of \u00a3100 towards tutor ship at the Royal College of Music was\nawarded to Fiona Kelly.\nNew IC Radio franchise holders announced\nby Paul Dias\nThe elections for the committee of\nImperial College Radio were held\non Wednesday, but failed to\nproduce many surprises. The only\nhotly contested post this year was\nthat of Station Manager. The\ncandidates standing were James\n(Jaymz) Handley and Adam\nBlackaby, who are both IC Radio\nAssistant Station Managers this\nyear, and New Election. The\ncandidates were questioned on\nsubjects ranging from improving\nprogramme quality to what colour\nIC Radio's studios should be\npainted. After a close vote, James\nHandley was elected, and takes over\nas Station Manager from Dave\nCohen, on August 1st. The other\nmajor changes during the evening\nwere Paul Dias taking over from\nDeclan Curry as News Editor and\nMelissa Parcell becoming\nresponsible for the Record and Tape\nLibrary. A dead-heat between\nCatherine Low and New Election\nmeans that the election for the post\nof Treasurer will have to be re-held.\nThe other results see lit de change\nfrom this year's committee, with\nSteve Dunton as Technical\nManager, Mellisa Ali as Secretary,\nDonna Sibley in charge of Publicity\nand Promotions, and Neil Bond as\nHead of Music. The new Assistant\nStation Managers are Ian Parish,\nAdam Blackaby, Amran Hassa and\nAbi Adeboyo.\nPatten puts Queen in student union horror\nby Declan Curry\nNew laws cracking down on student\nunions may be outlined as early as\nthis November. The Financial\nTimes reports that the next Queen's Speech will contain plans by John\nPatten, Education Secretary, to\nreform student union membership\nand funding. The decision now\nclears the way for Mr Patten to\nmake his long anticipated\n'announcement' on voluntary\nmembership.\nThe much postponed students'\ncharter has also been published by\nthe Department for. Education\n(DFE). The draft 'Charter for\nHigher Education' contains none of\nthe contentious ideas which caused\na Cabinet clash on the contents last\nFebruary. Plans for removing grant\nawarding and fee paying powers\nfrom local education authorities\n(LEAs) have been quashed, as has\nthe proposal for the unified grant-fee-student loan paying body.\nThe Government instead plans to\nspeed up the payment of grants, fees\nand loans. Students must now be\ntold 'quickly' by their LEA if they\nare entitled to a maintenance grant.\nWritten reasons and details of the\nappeals procedure must be given if\nthe application is refused. The sum\nawarded must be explained, and the\nfirst instalment must be ready for\ncollection at the start of the first\nterm. If a delay is likely, the LEA must warn students in advance.\nTuition fees must also be paid on\ntime. Complaints about grants and\nfees should be made to the Local\nGovernment Ombudsman.\nUniversities are to speed up\nstudent loan applications, and must\nhave eligibility certificates ready for\nstudents within two weeks of\napplication. Decisions on access\nfund grants must be made within 4\nweeks of the final deadline, but\nuniversities are still left to invent\ntheir own rules on eligibility. The\nCharter states that you 'can be\nconsidered for help if you are in\nsevere financial difficulty'.\nThe Government Charter notes\nthat students have responsibilities\n'to get the most out of teaching and\nlearning'. Students, it reads,\n'should take part in seminars and\nattend lectures on time'. The\nGovernment Charter insists that\nuniversities provide 'well-informed\nguidance arid counselling from\ntutors and careers staff. Students\nare also entitled to expect the\nuniversity to make 'proper\narrangements for student security'.\nA Government plan to link\nstudent assessments of lecturers\nwith lecturers pay has been dropped\nafter lobbying from the Committee\nof Vice Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) and trade unions. The\nCharter now states that 'more and\nmore universities are encouraging\nhigh quality by including a performance related part in staff\npay'. Student opinions of\ndepartments are to be 'taken\naccount of by Funding Councils'.\nThe Higher Education Quality\nCouncil (HEQC) will audit\nuniversities regularly, and an\nofficial summary of their report\nmust appear in the University\nprospectus. Information about the\nperformance of universities\nincluding degree results and\nproportion of graduates gaining\nemployment is to be compiled by\nthe Higher Education Funding\nCouncil (HEFC), also for inclusion\nin the prospectus. Students are\nentitled to complain if a university\ndoes not meet its standards, and can\nobject to misleading information in\na university prospectus. These\ncomplaints can be sent to the\nHEQC.\nThe proposed Charter has no\npower or sanctions to enforce many\nof its provisions. Lorna Fitzsimons,\nNUS President, said the Charter\n'lacked teeth,' and was 'descriptive\nrather than pro script ive.' The DFE\nsays it is 'keen to seek views' on the\ncharter, and suggestions will be\naccepted by the DFE in Great Smith\nStreet until 2 July.\nMen at work\nby Bryan Cro taz The warden of Linstead Hall has\nbeen inundated with complaints this\nweek as electricians installed new\nfire alarms.\nDr Jan Bradley said she was\nconcerned that she had not been\ninformed about the fitting of the\nalarms. Dr Bradley was also\nworried that students had to vacate\ntheir rooms for a day to allow the\nwork to be done. Linstead residents\nsay the work played havoc with\nvital revision. 'The whole hall\nvibrated with a horrible noise,' an\noccupant told Felix.\nThe complaints follow similar\nincidents in Selkirk and Tizard\nHalls last week, when workmen\nremoved tiles from showers. The\nwork was stopped after Dr John\nHassard, Selkirk-Tizard warden,\ncomplained to the College Estates\nDivision. An Estates spokesman\nsaid the renovations were\n'regrettable but necessary'.\nDr Hassard said that this was the\nwrong time of year to carry out such\nwork. The Selkirk-Tizard warden\nadded that the improvements would\nallow more rooms to be during\nholidays by the Conference Office.\n'This Hall is primarily for students,\nnot for summer letting s,' he said.\nPick-axe\nby our News Staff\nTumbling student numbers and an\nimminent cash crisis may force a merger of departments within the\nRoyal School of Mines (RSM).\nJohn Archer, College pro- Rector\nis now drawing up consultative\nplans which could change the\ncharacter of the RSM.\nThe spur for the consultations is\nrising debts in all RS M departments. RSM budgets will be\nreadjusted on 28 June. Felix\nunderstands that these budgetary\nreadjustment may include\n'renegotiated employment\ncontracts', or sacking s. The deficit in Geology is\nattributed to the high cost of\nteaching undergraduates. The\nproposals emphasise that\npostgraduate and other research\nbrings in more funding overall to\nthe department. A joint degree\ninvolving Material Sciences and the\nPhysics, Mechanical Engineering\nand Aeronautics departments is also\nsuggested, as is closer collaboration\nbetween MRE, Geology and the\nCentre for Environmental\nTechnology.\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\n28 May 1993 Felix 968\nStrictly Ballroom...\nIC Dance Club looks back at the success of the dance teams in three\nnational competitions which took place last term.\nThis academic year has turned out\nto be a truly remarkable one for the\nIC dance teams. By wir r ning every\nsingle team and Offbeats contests in\nall the three inter-varsity\ncompetitions which the teams took\npart in this year, they have\naccomplished a feat which had\nnever occurred before.\nEach team consists of four\ncouples who dance one of the\nfollowing dances\u2014Waltz,\nQuickstep, Cha Cha and Jive and\nour dance club has four such teams\n(A,B,C and D). The team\ncompetition consists of four\nseperate knock-out competitions for\neach type of dance. The couples,\nirrespective of the teams, compete\ntogether along with other\ncompetitors. The points earned by\nthe couples in the competitions are\nthen added to give the total score for\neach team. The scores are\ncompared and the highest scoring\nA,B and C teams will be the\nwinners.\nAll the teams participated-in teh first competition organised by\nSheffield University. It took place\non 30th January with 25 competing\nUK universities. The competition\nbegan with several open\ncompetitions where some excellent\nindividual performances were\ndisplayed. Our teams evidently had\nno shortage of talent to dazzle the\ncompetitors. Both the Vienese\nWaltz and Tango opens were won\nby IC ballroom dancers and three\nIC Latin couples reached the final\nof the Samba open.\nThe much awaited team\ncompetitions began later on with an\nimpressive team-walk-on which\nafterwards ended in a friendly\ncheering match.. Of course it was to\nour advantage that 'IC' rhymed\nrather better than our main rivals\n'Oxford' and 'Cambridge'.\nLike any other contests, the team\ncompetitions were a very heated\naffair. Although the individual skills\nand performance were important,\nthe team members had to support\neach other to do well as a group.\nSo, warm encouragement was\nfreely exchanged and everyone\npractically went mad for their side\ncompeting on the floor.\nUnderstandably, it seemed every\nuniversity wanted to out-do their\nopponents in supporting their\nmembers. As a result, unbelievable\nexcitement filled the entire hall\nwhich was resonating with cries of\nsupport for their colleagues.\nAfterwards, while the results\nwere being sorted out, an\nadditional, knockout competition\nwas arranged. Two universities\ncompeted against each other in\ndances chosen by a draw and the\nwinner between them competed\nwith another winner and so, on. The\nopen ent IC faced inthe final was\nOxford who had beaten Cambridge\ninthe semi-final. But even they\nproved to be no match for IC as\nthey were clearly overpowered by\nour jive and quickstep team\ncouples.\nThe announcement of the final\nresults brought instant delight to\neveryone as IC won all A,B and\nC team competitions. No university\nhad won all three tides there before.\nThe second competition, the\nSouthern Ball, hosted by Bristol\nUniversity took place in the Winter\nGarden Pavilion, Western-SuperMare on St Valentine's Day. Only\nA,B and C teams were allowed to\ncompete against 21 participating\nuniversities but everyone performed\nmagnificently in both open and team\ncompetitions.\nIC had once again dominated the\nopens, by winning both Vienese\nWaltz and Rhumba. In the team\ncompetitions, most of the IC\ndancers reached the final and the\nfirst place in the Waltz, Cha Cha\nand Quickstep was won by our team\nmembers. The overall results again\nbrought victories to all our\ncompeting teams. It wasn't without\ndrama either. In the quickstep semi-final, one IC couple unintentionally\ntripped and fell, one of them badly\nscratching her foot. But they fought\nback bravely and deserving ly snatched the first place in the final.\nThe extra competition which took\nplace this time was the Off-Beat.\nThe Off-Beat is danced by a group\nof dancers who synchronise their\nsequence of actions with the music.\nThere were only three entrants-Imperial, Cambridge and Bath, but\nshaking off their flimsy challenges,\nImperial with the dance 'Lyndy\nHop' took the trophy with\nunmistakably best performance.\nAboard the coach home, there\nwas also another occasion to\nPage 12\nFelix 968\n'eat ure28 th May 1993\n\u2022\ncelebrate. At midnight, a sudden\nappearance of a birthday cake with\nloud singing surprised the team's Latin trainer, Vicki. It was also a fine chance to congratulate her\nalong with Dorothy, the other\ntrainer, the good results without\nwhom our teams would have lacked\nthe skill and enthusiasm to achieve.\nWith such successes behind the\nteams they faced, with mounting\npressure, one more hurdle. The last\ncompetition for this academic year\nwas the Inter-Varsity Ball,\ncelebrating its 30th anniversary. It\nwas to take place at home, in\nLondon, hosted by no one else but\nImperial College.\nThe IC teams had won this\ncompetition for the last two\nprevious years and with such\nimpressive records, it was of\nparamount importance that the\nteams repeated their wir in ing forms.\nIt took place in the Grosvenor Hotel\nat Park Lane on 7th March. Only\nA and B teams competed but all\nother members including many ex-members turned up to cheer the host\nteams with all they could give.\nThe final results were more than\nanyone had dreamed. Not only did\nIC retain the title but also almost\nevery couple came first in their\nINTER-VARSITY COMPETITION RESULTS\nTEAM A Waltz Brian Crotaz 1st Alice Jacques\nCha Cha Matthew Lewis 1st Vicky Kereszteng\nQuick Step Paul Chatrath 5th Quick Step\nPamela Witze\nJive Alex Kuniawan 1st Sonia Abubacker\nTEAM B Waltz Andrew Smith 2nd Joanne Wade\nCha Cha Tuang Lim 1st Lye-yen Tien\nQuick Step Lead Rezek 1st Patricia Domesteanu\nJive Satin Gungah 1st Shelagh Marshall\nrespective dances.\nHowever, the Off-Beat contest,\nthe final event of the night, was a much closer affair.

    "content": "Reviews28 May 1993\nHamlet Caroline Gordon's production of\n'Hamlet' presents us with a nearly\ncomplete version of Shakespeare's masterpiece. Indeed, she cuts only\ntwo scenes (those featuring the\nNorwegian Fortinbras) and\npersonally I think the play is better\nwithout these.\nHowever, I do argue with Steven\nElder's portray l of the tragic hero.\nElder, from the outset, plays a moody, angry, and very loud\nHamlet - one who seems mad from\nthe start. Likewise, Catherine\nGeorge as Ophelia begins the play\na little less than mentally stable. In\nboth cases, madness seems a little\npremature. David Arrowsmith\nplays a smarmy Cladius with a smile that is alone enough to have\nhim condemned as a murderer. As\nfor Gertrude (Sally Mortemore),\nshe seems so caught up in her lust\nfor Claudius that a true relationship\nbetween Hamlet and his mother\nfails to emerge, and whilst the ghost\nscenes verge on sadistic al( with\nHamlet at times assuming the\nposition of Christ on the cross),\nHamlet's relationship with Gertrude\ncould never be accused of being\nOedipal.\nGordon's production throws up\nsome interesting ideas, but on the\nwhole they seem to get lost in the\nmelodrama and sheer volume of the\nproduction.

Yes Inspector, it\nlooks like another Pratchett book\nhas hit the bookshelves again, and\nthis time its taking no prisoners.\nBut Sergeant, is it any different\nto the hordes of other Pratchett\nnovels that weigh down the local\nbranch of WH Smiths?\nFrankly inspector, No, but if I many venture an opinion, Sir?\nPlease do, Sergeant. We are\nprotectors of good taste here, no\nthought or cognitive process will be\ndisciplined, only the heinous crime\nof banality can be punished.\nWell Inspector, it appeared to be\nrather more satirical than usual Sir,\nit appeared that the dread author had\ntarget ted organised religion and\nparodied it with his gently\nhumorous style.\nBut were any of the jokes\ndifferent Sergeant?\nHardly Sir, but a good many\nwere pleasantly amusing.\nOverall, what was your\nimpression?\nSame as before Sir, No surprises.\nWhat do drink motivates this man\nPratchett to keep writing these\nbooks?\nThe money I would imagine Sir.\nAnd where do you think we will\nfind him, Sergeant?\nAlmost every-bloody-where Sir.\nThe Hair Bear Bunch\nWhen originally written in America\nby Tom Lehrer, back in the 'good\nold days' of the late fifties and\nsixties, his satirical songs were\nbanned in this country. Listening to\nthem, it's not hard to reason why.\nHe can come across as anti-war and\nanti-government, but don't all\nsatirists?\nHe does an excellent job of taking\nthe piss of everything from activists\nthat sing ridiculous folk songs, to\nthe American government, to the\nnotion of livening up church songs\nand an ingenious send up of the\nIrish and their extremely long\nsongs. Out of all the 27 songs, my\nfavourites were; 'I Got It From\nAgnes', a dirty little number about\nthe transmission if 'it'; \"The Vatican\nRag', the best satirical religious\n'sketch' that I have ever seen or\nheard; 'The Masochism Tango',\nwhich is self explanatory; and\n'Smut', which is also pretty much\nself explanatory.\nThe level of satire surpasses\nanything ever said on 'Have I Got\nNews For You' and it is delivered\nin an exquisite style than Angus\nDeayton would have problems\nimitating. All the cast are, well,\nlook up the words 'excellent' and\n'funny' in the thesaurus and all\npositive derivatives apply. I love the\nsongs, the cast, everything.

DaveDuCliche and Joe Baguley descend upon\nEMI's offices to hunt out one Glenn Gregory, to talk about stardom, Heave\n17, the pope and being Ugly\n(While Ian Wright talks about being\nmistaken for a famous footballer\nand being shot at)\n-\u2022III\nmm\nmi pic b vJ( Right, I say as we project ourselves\nup the escalator at Marble Arch.\nThere's an interview with a legitimate pop star just around the\ncorner (give 'em what they want,\nI say - sic. Ed), and being late in\nthese circumstances is the kind of\nsituation which demands summary\nexecution. No trial, pants exuding\ntell- tale smells and stains, blu b bing into the blindfold; a proper tw at' s death, to be followed by at wat' s funeral. Joe says calm down, Dave.\nYou've fucked up again, haven't you? I ask him the time. He looks\nat his watch, and wastes precious\nseconds. I look helplessly skyward.\nWe're late. If only shooting oneself\nin the foot metaphorically had\nvisible effects, we'd have an excuse\nthen, but we're trying desperately\nto find Manchester Square, the\nenigmatic Glenn Gregory and\nentourage. The bulb explodes in my\nhead again when I remember that\ntoo many questions about Heaven\n17 might not go down too well,\ndealing as we are with a new\nproject, Ugly, and new members;\nin all likelihood, they may get\npissed off should we be too\nobsessed with Mr Gregory'sT Vfriendly past. I 've an idea, Joe, I say. He turns, a stitch too many in\nli is eyebrows. He asks what my idea\nis. We play it cool, I say. Oh right,\nDave. Thanks. I'd never have\nthought of that.\nOne of them's been shot at twice,\nhasn't he? The other one's played\nsupport to Bros and listens to thrash\nmetal. And the other one... fuck.\nDidn't he used to be the lead singer\n(and John Uriel doesn't talk about\nbeing mistakenly called 'Ariel')\nCharity\nG: Well, two sensible people at the\ntable. A peak and some sunglasses\nD: Which is the one that's been shot\nat? twice?\nI: Three times now\nD: Three times?\nI: Naah\nof Heaven 17?\nSo, we arrive at the offices, and\nwait for them to turn up. Smart\nblack leather couch, I say. Joe says,\nsmart platinum discs, Dave. They\ndescend the stairs, Glenn Gregory,\nJohn Uriel, Ian Wright. Glenn\nGregory, minus sharp suit, plus cap\nand casuals. John looks cute and\nscally-esque, Ian looks like\nSuperman gone seriously mellow.\nThey smile, shake hands. We\ncorrespond. The consensus, says\nAlison of EMI press, is that we go\nto the pub. We shrug in a sort of\n'suits us' way, stifling the urge to\ngo weak and shout 'now you're\ntalking!'. Drinks on EMI. Smart.\nJoe takes up position. We assume\nyou can recognise initials as\nrepresentative of names. ' G' for\n'Glenn'; you see? simple enough,\nisn't it, and quite painless too. N.B. For the purposes of this interview,\nit would be easy to have a' J l' and\n'J2', for Joe and John, but as Joe\nis only there to take photos and\nfreeload on Guinness, I decided to\nerase his comments. Ha! Teach him\nto keep his mouth shut in future,\nbloody bugger...\nI: Bright here, inn it? D:I'm regretting not bringing any\nsunglasses now\nD: By whom?\nI:( An obliging drunk walks by,\nnods politely) By him, by the looks\nof it\nG: Don't laugh. That's our Radio\nOne plug ger( Everyone laughs)\nD:I understand you're keen to bury\nHeaven 17? Or rather, leave the\nidea of Heaven 17 behind?\nG: Yeah, I'm not ashamed of it, I had a great time and it's a credible\npast, I think. You know, there's nothing wrong with it, but I don't want it to keep constantly harping\nwith on Heaven 17, and everything\nI do now, is paralleled with Heaven\n17, although it's bound to be.\nD:( Sympathetically) Yeah.\nG: But it was really unlucky, well,\nnot unlucky, but those remixes\ncame out just when we were about\nto release Ugly stuff. We were in\nthe studios mixing the single at the\ntime.\nD: It's also confusing because it\ncoincides with Putting Our House\nIn Order, and that's got the Heaven\n17 remix of 'Gimme Shelter' on it.\nG: Well, we just said we'd do that\nbecause it's a good charity, and it's hard to say 'no'. In fact the only two\ncharities we've been involved with\nwere that and the one with Midge\nUre and Bob Geldof\nD: Band Aid\nG: Yeah. We did that, didn't know\nwhat the bloody hell it was, you\nknow. Two people call us up, and\nask us to come down and do a bit\nof backing singing, and we turned\nthe corner, and there was press\nthere, and all these people. It was\nreally weird. So we said that we\nwouldn't do any more charity\nthings, and the last thing that\nHeaven 17 did was that keeping\nyour house in order\nAgadoo\nD: did you play a large part in the\nremixing of 'Gimme Shelter'?\nG: No, well, I did actually. No, it's true, 'cause it's the last time Martin\n(Ware) and I were in the studio.\nWell, we did the Sheffield\nWednesday song, but I only did\nbacking vocals on that\nD: How do you think it compares\nwith the Arsenal song?\nG: Far superior.\nD:I heard it was a bit Ragga\nG:I like Ragga, but it's hardly\nRagga, is it. It's like 'Agadoo'.\nTippa Irie's 'Agadoo'. It's weird\nbecause Ugly aren't totally removed\nfrom Heaven 17, there are other\nparallels. But it's like the musical\ninfluences, the sound, Human\nLeague and, dare I say it, Gary\nNuman.\nD: He's a fascist, Gary Numan.\nG: Yeah? We're all tories\nJ: Oh, I'm a nazi (This, they\npersuade us without difficulty, is\ntheir little joke)\nD: We've reviewed the single\n('Boom the Future') this week. I really liked it, I thought it a very\nsmooth production, but there is still\na sense of Heaven 17, circa 'Fascist\nGroove Thing' with the chorus\n'brothers and sisters'\nG: Yeah, well, we didn't know the\nbastards were gonna remix it, did\nwe?\nD: How old is it now? thirteen years\nago?\n(Joe, speaking completely out of\nturn, interrupts with a comment\nabout 'Boom the Future'): Prefer\nthe acoustic version myself\nG: Lot of people do, but we\nPage 18\n\n"

Rachel Basset\nthrows back her head and gasps as she tackles the Mills and Boon\nFactor.\n'Saul, please'\n'Please what?'\n'Please-help me'.\nHe held still for a moment, as\nthough her words had surprised\nhim, but when her hips moved in\nan instinctive little movement\nagainst his leg he lower erd his head,\nand drew the throbbing aureole into\nthe heated cavern of his mouth...\nWham! Bam! Thank you ma'am!\nAnd as Saul continues to gratify\nCadace's baser urges, women\ncountry wide sink back into their\narmchairs, pop another Milk Tray\ninto their mouths and turn the page,\nhungry for the next nipple-tingling\ninstallment from Robyn Donald's 'Darker Side of Paradise'.\nIf insight into the erotic fantasies\nof several million women is what\nyour heart desires, you need look\nno further than Mills and Boon\nRomances, which are textbook\nstudies. They cover it all\u2014palm fringed tropical locations, designer\ndresses, powerful Jaguar-driving\nmen, beautiful women, and above\nall, Sex. Passionate Sex. Juicy,\nsquelch y, no-details-spared Sex.\nSo what are the conditions for\nthese fantasies on paper? What\npoints should a good author always\ninclude? Well, the first golden rule\nof Mills and Boon sex is that she has\nto be a virgin, and he never is. The\nreason for this is, I presume, to stop\nher looking promiscuous and also\nthat most of the heroes are in their\nmid-thirties and there has to be\nsomething slightly suspect about a35 year-old virgin. It smacks of\nsmelly nylon socks and beds its. Also, it might look as if he was\ngetting desperate and that would\nnever do, so he has to be\n'experienced'. (A particularly\nrevolting euphemism for virgin\nfrequently used is 'inexperienced',\nas in 'He was remorseful. 'The last\nthing I would have expected was\nthat you were inexperienced'. Did\nI hurt you, sweetheart?\").\nThe second golden rule is to be\nvery explicit and excruciatingly coy\nsimultaneously. There are certain\nwords, it seems, that just don't fit\nthe M&B image, so, for example,\nShe had been made for him, she\ndecided, knowing even as the silken\nlength of him thrust inside her that\nhe would fit perfectly, that he\nalways had.\nis perfectly acceptable, but the\nwords w* l ly,c* nd*m, or b* tt*m must remain taboo. No mucky or\nun glamorous bits are allowed, so\nnobody has periods, nobody ever\nLife after the Mills and Boon novel.\nUnadulterated heaving passion.\ngoes to the toilet and quite certainly\nnobody prematurely ejaculates.\nOfficially, nobody has genitals\neither but by careful reading we can\ndeduce their presence. A veil of\neuphemism is preserved, leading to\ncryptic statements like 'she raised\nher hips to him for the most intimate\nkiss of all' (whatever that means).\nA very common scene is a mock\nrape, or near rape, where the hero\n'uses his superior strength' against\nthe struggling heroine. Whether or\nnot this is a particular female\nfantasy, I don't know, but it seems\nto be popular. You may notice I choose my words carefully\u2014the\nreason it's mock rape is that the\nstruggling heroine wants it really,\nthe silly little tease, she's just too\nuptight to say so. Of course. All mock rapes include an abundance\nof phrases along the lines\u2014\nThe agony of the whole thing was\nthat her traitorous body wanted\nquite violently to respond to the\ncavalier treatment it was receiving,\nto thrust itself closer...\nIt was then that her fury died as\nother more treacherous emotions\nmade themselves known.\nAnother popular storyline is that\nthe hero and heroine find\nthemselves, for whatever carefully\nmanufactured reason, married. This\nis a good storyline from the points\nof view that 1) they can't stop living\ntogether, 'cos everyone would\nguess they were faking, so there's plenty of time for them to fall in\nlu u u ur r ve and 2) so that once they\nfall in lu u ur r ve, they can shag at\nonce without seeming immoral and\nupsetting Grandma. M&B quite\nclearly have it all sus sed. Criticism apart, though, it's all\ngripping stuff, and a good solid\ndose of escapism for the more\nfrustrated amongst us, she typed\npassionately, muscular fingers\nthrusting even harder and deeper\nagainst the word processor keys as\nthe article drove on relentlessly to\nits climax. She could only gaze at\nthe screen in wonderment as she\ngroped and writhed for words,\nendlessly seeking fulfilment and for\na good ending. At last, though, at\nlast her heart beat faster and the\nblood raced in her veins as she\nsensed the article coming to an\nend\u2014yes, it was coming, oh yes.\nHer throat tensed in a silent scream\nof triumph. Oh yes, oh yes.\nWas it good for you too?\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Shoot your dog\nAs an innocent girl from a quiet city\nin Kent, I had a lot to get used to\nwhen I arrived, fresh-faced and\nwide-eyed in London. I think I adjusted fairly well to the blatant\nprostitutes' cards, the tourists and\nthe dive-bombing pigeons, but one\naspect of Londoners makes me\nshudder to this day. Call me naive,\ncall me immature, but I will never\ncome to terms with the local dogs.\nMy question is\u2014what do people\nget out of these creatures, these\nstrange half-rat half-gerbil mutants?\nWhy do they feel the need to walk\naround connected to a yapping ball\nof smelly fluff by a garishly\ncoloured extensible umbilical cord?\nThe only concrete conclusion about\nthe psychological reasons for doing\nthis is that it can't be anything to do\nwith sex, since as far as I knew\nFreud never said anything about it.\nWhat, then, is the urge that drives\npeople to keep a pek in e se,a poodle\nor any other of the multitude of toy\ndogs whose names I forget\n(hereafter to be referred to as 'rats'\nfor simplicity)? Well, it must be\npretty strong, because in my time\nThe last of my exams. The last of\nmy exams! No more toiling over\ntextbooks and making excuses to\nwatch 'Good Morning with Anne\nand Nick', soon Hyde Park and The\nCamden Palace would be mine! Just\nthe slight impediment of a statistics\nexam standing in my way. Well,\ntowering in my way, a black jungle\nclad mountain, writhing with alien\ncreatures supping on bitter life and\nshrieking insane anthems across the\nsurrounding plains.\nIn short, I knew only one statistic,\nand that was that I was probably\ngoing to fail.\n'Don't worry man,' says Bruce\noutside the exam hall. 'You can\nwork out the chances of pulling a blue ball from a bag can't you?' I nod. 'All you need to know.' I ask\nBruce if he has ever heard of\nstraight line regression. 'Won't come up.' he says. The Weibull\ndistribution? Nah. Probability\ndensity functions? 'What, in a statistics exam?!'.\nHmmm. So Bruce, I 'll have to\nanswer three of four questions about\nblue ball selection? 'Well, colours\nmight vary, they snuck a red one in\nlast year but the principles are\nhere I have seen people go to\nridiculous lengths for their pooches.\nI have seen a woman with a tricycle\nwho kept her three rats in the\nbasket. I have seen a man walk his\nrat and have to stop every two paces\nto let it catch up. I have seen rats\nwearing little mackintoshes, for\nheaven's sake. I thought I'd seen\neverything until I went to Harrods\nand saw a diamond rat collar. Do\npeople have no shame? Do they not\nrealise that a creature who has one\ninch legs is maybe, just maybe, a little out of the ordinary? (One\nthought I did have, actually, is that\npossibly men get a kick out of\nowning an animal whose penis is\nthree quarters the length of its legs.\nButcher than a Rottweiler any\nday.).\nI am not a heartless woman. I do\nnot believe that these poor creatures\nshould be slain. I do believe,\nhowever, that we should register all\ncanine animals less than six inches\nlong and make sure that all of them,\nexcept for a few, should be\nneutered. The rest should be bred\ncarefully and used as a reminder of\nbasically the same.' Okay, at least\nI won't be drowning alone I think\nto myself.\nA girl, who shall remain\nnameless (to match the big strip of\nblack card she always wears over\nher face) gave me a sheepish look.\n'I'm dead Owain,' she sighed.\n'Well, you do look a little dog-eaten.' Actually, she looked more\nlike she'd just eaten a dog. Not\nsome snack sized Pekinese either.\nA big meaty cross-breed specially\nbred in South East Asia to chew on\nschool children during the hot\nsummer months.\n'I was up all night, trying to learn\nfor this fucking exam. Just going\nthrough the notes, again and again.\nI didn't even go to bed!' She read\nhis notes without bursting into a fit\nof prolonged sleeping? This girl had\ndedication. Or... 'Well, it was the\nProPlus you know, and then I dropped some speed, and then...'\nSuddenly my experiments with\nCadbury's 'Mellow' instant coffee\nand a bottle of Diet Coke began to\npale. Maybe I deserved to fail.\n'Show time,' says Bruce\nenigmatically, and we fde slowly\nendlessly into the hall. I shuffle,\nhead hung low, thinking of Oscar\nWilde in 'The Ballad of Reading\nGaol'. I can almost feel the chains\nclanking about my ankles. And the\nhonours degree with my name on\nit disappearing into a huge iron safe\nwith a metallic thud. Oh well,\nthere's always the circus.\nSit down. Deep breaths. The hell\nwith that, just remember to breathe!\nI have five minutes reading time so\nI watch the lucky songbirds that are\nthe rest of IC's student populace\nstrolling in the sun outside.\nSomehow I sense that time will not\nbe a critical factor in this exam. -'Okay, you can begin', says the\nin vigil at or. 'No!', I want to shout.\nYou may begin. Whether I can or\nnot, well that's what the exam is\nhere for.\nI look at the first page and know\nI'm doomed. Just row after row of\nnumbers. Hang on, that's the\ntabulated Normal distribution. The\nexam proper must be somewhere\nunderneath. I dive through all my\nhandy handouts and find an\ninnocent looking piece of paper\nwith 'Exam\u2014Duh, Stupid!' written\non it. Was I being paranoid or did\nthis seem particularly personal?\nQUESTION ONE. A young\nstudent, ' Mr B', has calculated he\nspent more time learning to play the\nTibetan nose horn than revising for\nhis statistics exam. Also, he had\ndetermined his IQ to be exactly 4.5.\n(He treasures that 0.5, no rounding\nplease.) Determine, using any\nbloody theorem you choose,\nwhether Mr B has a hope in hell of\npassing this exam.\nOkay, paranoid delusions. Well,\nI had to have something to take my\nmind of the task at hand. Answer\nthree questions. I couldn't even read\nthree of the questions! Not a blue\nball in sight. I decide to do my best\nquestion first. Two minutes later\nI'm onto my worst. Then it's time\nto draw Mr Potato heads on the\nblank pages.\nI sit there, doodling away and\nwondering whether to cry. A supervisor places a hand on my\nshoulder. 'You're in trouble son,'\nhe whispers. He looks at Mr Potato\nhead number three. 'You're not\neven a gifted artist, shackled by\ncruel fate to study here at Science\nHeadquarters.' Thanks, rub it in.\nInto unyielding concrete preferably.\nThere's only one hope left. I scrawl all over an empty page\u2014\n'There are lies, damned lies, and\nstatistics.' Then it's off to sleep.\nAfter an hour I awake to the silent\nsound of people not writing\neverything they know about\nstatistics onto their answer sheet.\nWith my head hung low I hand in\nmy answer script/canvas/pillow. I slink out. Around me people are\ndiscussing in minutia 'four part c'. Just come to the Queens Arms\nyou who I call my friends. There\nare Rum and Cokes to be drunk.\no Felix 968\npinion\n28 May 1993\nVUi-VU-HIS Pifi3T W human cruelty and a warning\nagainst using animals as fashion\naccessories.\nI realise that this state of affairs\nwill not come around for a long\ntime, until the Government wake up\nto what is happening in our capital\ncity.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\n28 May 1993 Felix 968\nNam Pai Chuan\nOn the 16th May, a small but\ndedicated group of practitioners of\nNam Pai Chuan kung fu left the\nbounds of South Kensington for the\nout lands of Fulham. Their purpose\n- to test their skill and courage at\nthe West London open Martial Arts\ntournament (semi contact).\nThe day opened with the Form\ncompetition. A form is a sequence\nof set moves, practiced in order to\nperfect technique and coordination.\nThe majority of competitors were\nfrom Karate schools, and due to\ntheir complexity and flowing nature\nthe Kung Fu forms seemed out of\nplace compared to the Karate style's more direct nature. However, one\nof our black belts still achieved 5th place in this contest.\nAfter this were the sparring\ncompetitions, with four categories\nJuniors, Womens, Mens (coloured\nbelts), Mens (seniors). Our only\nfemale entrant, Margaret, had a considerable task in the first round\nwhen taking on last year's reigning\nchampion. Again the differences in\nstyle became apparent as Margaret\ninitially had difficulty scoring points\nin a Karate style competition.\nHowever she soon gained control\nand achieved a convincing victory.\nHaving found her footing with the\nrules and style she managed to\nachieve a silver trophy in this, her\nfirst ever sparring competition.\nWe gained a considerable success\nin the men's( coloured belts)\ncompetition, with all of our\ncompetitors going through to the\nfirst round, including a white belt.\nBoth Gus Fox (Mech Eng) and Paul\ngot through to the semi finals, and\nmanaged to win these. This left the\nfinal as a fight between two of our\nclub members, reminiscent of our\nSunday morning sparring classes.\nPaul won the fight and the gold\ntrophy, Gus achieving silver.\nSuccess was not so great in the\nsenior's competition, with our only\ncompetitor out in the 2nd round.\nOur success overall was highlighted\nin the juniors competition, with two\nyellow belts from another Nam Pai\nChuan society reaching the semi\nfinal, even though they were\ncompeting against black belts. They\ngained silver and bronze medals.\nUnfortunately, due to injury we\nwere only able to field 4\ncompetitors for a five man team in\nthe team event. We won two out of\nthe first three fights, with Gus Fox,\na blue belt, defeating a Karate black\nbelt. In what was for us the deciding\nround, the opposition fighter was\nforced to retire due to a previous\ninjury, so the fight was forfeited,\nand we were unable to continue.\nThe match was awarded to the other\nteam.\nAll in all, this was a very\nsuccessful day for our competitors\nadds proved to be a great\nexperience, with us securing one\nbronze, three silver and a gold\nmedal.\nThe Tenpin Bowling Club has\nenjoyed a very satisfying year, with\nmore than a fair share of trophies\nin our bag and several club records\ndemolished and re-written. More\nimportantly, we have finally arrived\nat the pinnacle of student bowling\nand are looking forward to better\nthings to come.\nUndoubtedly the highest\nachievement of the year was\nemerging runner-up at the UCTBA\n(Universities and Colleges Tenpin\nBowling Association)\nChampionship. Our previous best\nperformance was making it to the\nquarter finals last year only to put\nup a poor showing against\nNottingham. This year, as 2nd highest pinfall qualifiers, we put\nSouthampton in their place to meet\nBirmingham in the semi-finals.\nWhat an appropriate time to bowl\na record team score of 7629, an\naverage per bowler of 159!\nUnfortunately we were unable to\nrepeat that performance against the\nformidable Leeds in the grand final,\nand had to settle for second place.\nNo one complained because we also\nBottom\nwalked away with highest B Team\nand C \u2014team game trophies, and the\nmemory of an unforgettable 268 by\nPhil West.\nWe have also been well\nrepresented in the various student\ntournaments, only failing to send a team to Liverpool Quads, which\nsome may argue was a tactical\ndecision. Our players have again\nperformed commendably, ensuring\nentry fees were not spent in vain.\nWe started the season falteringly,\nmanaging only a mediocre showing\nin both the U AU one-day\nchampionship and Notts Doubles.\nThe next tournament on the\ncalendar was our very own Imperial\nTrios, staged at Hollywood Bowl\nTottenham. We fielded 4 teams,\nwith 1 team narrowly missing the\ncut by 1 pin. Human error on our\npart resulted in 3 trophies going into\nthe wrong hands, including those of\nour skipper Pete Sharpe, who had\n;o hand his back with much\nunwillingness.\nAston Doubles proved to be a good tournament, with Melvin\nCurran and Phil West clinching 2nd Page 14\nClubs & Societies\nBoating\nSo far this has been an excellent\nyear for the Boardsailing Club. We\nbegan the year with the largest\ninflux of new members ever\nrecorded. The majority of these\nwere beginners and it has been great\nto watch most of them progress,\nfrom falling in every 30 seconds to\ncompetent sailors, capable of safely\nsailing around the reservoir.\nInitially Wednesday afternoons\nwere heavily over-subscribed as\nexpected, and surprisingly the\nnumbers have not dropped until\nvery recently. Although our\nmembership at Queen Mary\nReservoir has now expired we are\nstill meeting Tuesday lunchtime in\nSouthside and we have several\nevents still to come.\nWe have been on several\nweekend trips to the coast including\nexotic locations like Gosport,\nGower (Wales) and Brightlingsea.\nAt Brightiingsea we met with Essex\nUni but unfortunately the wind did\nnot permit any serious racing so we\nwere forced to relax and enjoy the\nsun. Nearly everyone managed to\njump off the waves, sometimes you\ndidn't get much choice! Amazingly\nunlike the rest of the year we didn't even break any kit. (A trip, all for\nreview\ncharity!)\nJames Slaughter is completing his\nfirst season, sailing in the British\nFunboard Association Race Series\nat events all over the country. He\nhas achieved some very respectable\nresults and we hope he will continue\nhis success.\nOn 15-16th May we took part in\nthe first Bic Student Windsurfing\nChampionships at Clacton-on-Sea.\nOur dynamic team of ten left\ncollege on the Friday evening. The\njourney was long and uneventful,\napart from the dodge ms with the\nbus in South Kensington and the\nexperience with the new roundabout\nin Colchester. In an effort to reduce\nthe cost we had booked a six berth\ncaravan for ten, a really cunning\nidea never to be repeated.\nOn the Saturday morning we\nwoke at 8.00am to find perfect\nconditions, high onshore winds and\nsunshine!! For the first time ever we\nwere on the beach at 9.00am and it\nwasn't long before we had rigged\nour sails. The small waves provided\nsome testing, but exciting sailing\n(fortunately the Rescue boat was on\nhand to help those in need). By this\ntime the other teams had started to\nFelix 968\narrive and approximately eighty\nsailors had made the effort to get out\nof bed, forget looming exams and\nget on the beach. The racing took\nthe form of a figure of eight slalom\ncourse around two buoys, starting\nand finishing on the beach. Forty\nsailors from twelve different\nUniversities entered the racing. It\nwas very competitive and exciting\n(even for the beginners who\ncouldn't race because the wind was\ntoo strong). As night fell we retired\nto McDonalds and then the bar to\ndiscuss the day's results and more\nimportantly our tactics\u2014win at all\ncosts!\nSunday arrived blowing and\nsunny again...perfect! (Maybe\nAlaric's absence had an effect on\nthe weather.) The racing continued\nwith the same format, as did our\nsuccess. Everyone managed to\nimprove on their Saturday\nperformance and our overall team\nposition was looking very\npromising. In the last final Imperial\ntook 4th,5 th and 6th place, very\nimpressive results considering the\ntough opposition. By keeping the\nraces short and continuous we had\ncompleted over thirty races in the\n28 May 1993\nweekend. The individual event was\nwon by a local from Essex Uni, but\nDan Laurijssen and James Slaughter\ntook third and fourth place\nrespectively. In the team event we\nthought we had done enough to take\nthe title, however we overlooked\nthe team from Cambridge and we\nhad to settle for second place. After\nvisiting McDonald's again to stock\nup on junk food we headed home.\nIt was an excellent weekend, we\ncame second, got drunk and\nsunburnt and we didn't break much\nkit. (Our thanks must go to Roger\nLightfoot from Guy's Hospital for\norganising the event, we look\nforward to next year. Hopefully the\nweather will allow beginners to\nrace.)\nLooking to the future we have the\nHayling Island Marathon on\n12-13th June, and another trip is\nbeing organised for the last week of\nterm. Anyone who is interested in\nsailing (any standard welcome)\nincluding students at St Mary's meet us on any Tuesday, 1.00pm in\nSouthside Upper Lounge or contact\nmyself James Mayhew Mech Eng\nII. Hook in, get in the straps and\nhang on!!\nbacktracking: Bowling\nIt was another tale of missed\nopportunity when our team came\n4th again at Birmingham Sixes. Lee\nBrockless, Sam Chen, Dave\nWilkins and Melvin Curran shot\naverages of 173, 171, 170 and 169\nrespectively, a laudable team effort\ndespite testing conditions.\nOur latest outing was to the\ndistant Hull Trios. Lack of sleep\ntook its toll on many of our players\nwho never quite recovered on the\nlanes. Sam Chen amazed us by\nbowling a223 and his team did in\nfact qualify for the 2nd round, only\nto wilt in the limelight. Next year\nwe are considering chartering a plane to get us there.\nWith the daunting 12 hour Leeds\nMarathon and new Novices\nTournament still to come, we may\nyet witness more heroics.\nOn the domestic front, the\nInternal Trios League saw the top\nplace within reach of 3 or 4 teams.\nAfter a hard-fought final week,\nWibble emerged champs, 2nd place\nwent to Hedgehog II and Swan\nVesta took 3rd. The Turkeys\nmanaged a meagre 5th despite\nplace, Sarah McCarthy and Richard\nStockley missing the stepladder\nfinal by a familiar solitary pin, and\nother couples playing well.\nSouthampton Singles again saw\ninspired play by our brood. SiangYong Lim, Pete Sharpe and Matt\nBell produced a high standard of\nplay and Lim eventually settled for\n3rd place while Sharpe collected a trophy for high handicapped game,\nthis time for keeps.\nThe Popular Brunei Doubles held\nat the Airport Bowl was a disappointing tournament, with a field of strong opposition and an\naverage effort from our lot denying\nus qualifications for the 2nd round.\nTwo teams were dispatched for\nSheffield Quads and a miscalculation on a key person's part meant we almost missed the\nroll-off. Fortunately all wasn't lost\nand Andy Glading went on to bowl\na remarkable game (229) and series\nto earn himself 2 trophies. Dave\nWilkins, one-fourth of the team that\ncame overall 4th, also bagged the\nrunner-up trophy in the singles\nsection.\namassing highest pinfall and 2\nscratch trophies. They were\novertaken by the Flaming Carrots\nwho put in a strong finish.\nThe Spring Doubles again\nfeatured Matt Bell and Haff Al Qassab, them of the Wibble fame,\npitted against newcomers Roger\nChalfont and Kwai Lee in the finals.\nExperience on the part of Bell and\nAl-Qassab helped to seal their\nvictory.\nThe quest for club champion took\nthe form of the Singles\nChampionship. After 2 sittings,\nPete Sharpe, Phil West, Sam Chen\nand Richard Waring met in the\nround-robin final. Immense staying\npower finally put 'rubbish skip'\nSharpe on the winners' podium with\n11.35 points. Runner-up with 8.67\nwas Chen and West took 3rd place\nwith 7.22 points. The inter-CCU\nchallenge promised to be the grand\nfinale of the term. RCS have been\nknocking on C& Gs door for the last\nfew years without great success.\nWhile RSM could never quite find\na winning team due to sheer lack of\nnumbers. The encounter wasn't as\nclose as expected, and C&G get to\nhave their name engraved on the\nplaque yet again.\nThe Annual Sponsored Bowl was\none of the social activities held this\nyear with much success. Fun was\nhad by all, especially those in fancy\ndress (Hi Fred) and all funds raised\ngo towards cancer research. We\nhave also initiated the Phil Wren\nMemorial Trophy in memory of a dearly departed team-mate, and\nwon it (thank goodness) playing\nagainst our guest Brunei University.\nMany will remember the Christmas\nBowl as a rare chance to be silly on\nthe lanes, and it was a real treat to\nsee everyone in smart garb for the\nChristmas Dinner. If only we could\nbehave ourselves till after pudding\nwas served.\nThe Club has gone from strength\nto strength, and we hope to better\nour achievements come next\nseason. If there are any budding\nbowlers out there who'd like a slice\nof the action, contact Rachael Tay\n(captain) on in 6018 or via\nMaterials PG pigeonholes.\n\n"

    "content": "Music\nChris Isaak \u2014 San Francisco Pays Chris Isaak has always been a retrospective figure, harking back\nto a simpler age of American Pie,\nspace shots and B movies from the\ndrive-in. And so it is with 'San\nFrancisco Days'; even down the the\ntrack listing on the front cover just\nlike Otis Reading or Aretha\nFranklin did.\nIt set a scene which trails\nthroughout the album, without guile\nor packaging. The atmosphere is\npleasant and warm, lazy late\nsummer sun sheds its rays abroad\nand Chris warbles on in his rich,\nmellow way, covering Neil\nDiamond's 'Solitary Man' with an\neasy regard characteristic of a man\nwho's voice is his instrument.\nForget all that grunge-wailing for\na moment, Chris has a voice to\ntingle your spine to distraction. A Hammond organ takes the stage\nwhere required; guitars pick\nthroughout, gently focussing our\nglaze, soloing for only brief\nintervals.\n'Beautiful Homes' takes you on\nas troll in' drive through Beverly\nHills, maybe, where everything's beautiful. Just like Chris himself,\nbe qu if fed with a chiselled jaw. A face able to break hearts as a matter\nof course should not be able to sing\nlike Roy Orbison before it's passed\nfifty at least (jealousy rears).\n'5.15' is the pick of the bunch.\nWhereas stations are the\nquintessential setting for leaving\nsongs, we get in deeper this time.\nNow dusk is falling, a light breeze\npicks up, it ends up a brooding\nwhisper. You couldn't imagine it at\nPaddington, sometimes only the\nreal thing will do. Chris Isaak is\nAmerican, certainly, wholesome as\napple pie, undoubtedly good.\nTintin.\nNaked Truth \u2014 Fight Judging by the cover, these guys\nlook cool and mean business.\nThey're a black rock/metal/thrash\noutfit from Atlanta with obvious\nLiving Colour and Fishbone\ncomparisons, in that they seem to\nshare defiance coupled with\naggression.\nHomelessness, dealers and the\npolice are all rolled into one with\nthe funky 'Downtown', while the\ntitle track is the absolute showcase,\nchanging rhythm 3 times, a solid\n7-minute stance against racism.\n'Red River', an epic also on the\nsame theme is the good ol' track\nperfect for losing brain cells to.\n'Lovejoy', 'Black' and 'IAm He'\nare also worth noting from a consistently good debut.\nThe technical ability of this band\nis unquestionable but somehow, the\nEverything But The Girl\n\u2014 Home Movies Subtitled 'The Best of Everything\nBut The Girl', the first thing you\nwill learn is that you probably\nhaven't read the Senseless Things\nreview on the opposite page; if you\nhave, there is little point my going\nover the retrospective/re-evaluation\nthat is a necessary part of the\n'greatest hits' ethos. With 'Home\nMovies', the majority of you will\nflashback to 1988 for 'Apron\nStrings', T don't want to talk about\nit' (I will be asking questions about\nthis at the end of the review, so keep\nreading) and 'The night I heard\nCaruso sing' from that year's Tdlewild'.\nAnother thing is that Ben and\nTracey have tended towards playing\nout their relationship in their songs,\nand the videos to their songs; I don't know, but do you feel they've\nexploited a sense of universal\nvoyeurism, that we're all being\ntempted to look, and to continue to\nlook, as they tear themselves apart\nfor the television? That their\nsongwriting has tended to circulate\naround the submission/domination\nof the 'love' thing (did you get that?\nthat's the ' LOVE' thing - sic. Ed)\nis of further testament to this.\nHmm. And on to the music, I feel. Yep. It's all beautiful\nlanguorous melodies, sensitively\nconstructed and delicately executed.\nThey wrote some great songs, and\nit's sad that they're mainly\nremembered for cover versions (do\nexcuse him. I don't quite know why\npotentially inspiring ideals on a tried\nand tested formula doesn't quite hit\nthe mark, nonetheless the relative\nnovelty value of black rock bands\nwill probably ensure their success.\nThe ghost of Jimi lives on.\nLucas.\nFelix 968\nhe's writing in past tense - sic.

'Apron Strings' is my next,\nand then...\nThe point is, you may not have\nliked them the first time around,\n(and God knows, I wasn't keen) but\nthey occupy a peculiar space in\neveryone's closets; they rendered\nmy relationships and would-be\nrelationships more emotional and\nmore sensitive than they deserved,\nlike Lloyd did once, like The Bible\nSky clad \u2014 Jonah' sArk WHO O A ARGH!

Unlike\ntheir three previous offerings,\nthere's not really anything here to\nget your knees up to down at the\nce ili dh. It's ll good, proficient\nthrash which happens to have a violin in it, that's all. The lyrics are\nthe usual ranting about how big\nbusinesses are destroying the planet\nwhilst her inhabitants sit numbly in\nfront of the television, neatly\nsummed-up by the (unintentionally)\nhilarious pastiche of the spoken\nintroductions to 'The Eve of the\nWar' from Jeff Wayne's 'War of\nthe Worlds', but the music is too\nsombre. All the album needs is a rousing tune like 'The Widerskins\nJig' from the first album, but sadly\nthat is lacking. It's a shame to see\nlunacy of this quality go to waste\non such a preponderance of serious\nsongs.\nFreddy Cheeseworth.\nNaked Truth: Look cool! Mean business! Fight!\nPage 17\n\n"

They\ndumped all their gear, and played\nit, and it was their biggest hit.\nI:D 'you reckon we should release\nthe b side?\nJ: On the second chorus, I shout in\nthe background\nMaterial\n(Conversation continues along\nequally pale and interesting lines;\nI generously allow Joe to clear his\nthroat once or twice. We have a smoke, swig our pints lad dish ly, and recoil from overbearing\nsunlight)\nD: So what's up next?\nG:I 've written about six, probably\nre-do two or three now. You see,\nthe idea at first was to not let\nanybody know it was anything to do\nwith Heaven 17, come in from a very left-field, k very 'club'\nbackground, there's a track called\n'Born with it* and a track called\n'Greed', and they're very fast, very\nhard, about 145 bpm. like really\nfucking fast, really in your face, but\nthen the remix of 'Temptation'\ncame out, and every one was really\nkeen, and I was desperately fighting\nagainst it because it fucked up the\noriginal plan... But, slowly but\nsurely, everyone, including me, the\nrecord company, friends, we just\nhad to face the fact that the plan was\nno longer any use. And\nunfortunately, when people say\nUgly sounds like Heaven 17, we\ndon't; Ugly sounds like Heaven 17\nremixes... But if we had half a hit\nwith this one...\n(Joe, in another rare moment of\nlyrical brevity, pops up mid-camera\nclick to ask another question. I groan inwardly):What do you\ndefine as half a hit?\nG: Top forty, somewhere in the top\nforty, just to establish Ugly as a name, 'cause it's been on tv, it's been on the Chart Show, been on\nThe Big Breakfast, so people are\nseeing it a little bit. And then there's the next one, but that depends very\nmuch on what this one does. I mean, do we go really hard and\nweird, 'cause this is like a crossing\npoint between the coarse, hard stuff\nwe've done, and the stuff that's on\nthe album, songs called 'Starlove',\none called 'Prettyhead', one called\n'Slow All Over', and they're like\nnormal songs but done in a weird\nwav. kind of like earl v Roxv Music.\npic by Joe Ba;\nstandard songs but the way they've\nbeen treated, it ain't. normal\nJ: But it all goes back to songs\nI: Like that 'Gimme Shelter' thing\nD: Yeah. Thought the Heaven 17\nversion was the most radical. That\nand 808 State's version\nG: Well, there was no song. When\nwe said we'd do it, and all the other\npeople who'd done it, when we\nstarted to take it apart, and look at\nwhat was there, there was nothing.\nIt was basically Jagger strutting his\nstuff\nD: And Keef\nJ: With lots of drugs and alcohol\nG: They're good at that bit\nFootball\n(Interview postponed temporarily as\nlaughter makes its presence rather\nrudely known)\nD: You been asked to do any other\nPOHIO stuff?\nG: Yeah, but we refused, 'cause\nUgly were getting delayed,\nregularly by about three or four\nweeks, and I was being asked to\npromote Heaven 17, and I did, until\nI just turned round as said no, no\nmore. From now on I'm Ugly.\nExtremely Ugly. 100% Ugly.\nD: But your original idea is shafted\nG: We can't change anything, we'd end up chasing our tails. This is\nmuch more a band thing than\nHeaven 17; We're going to take\nUgly on tour, and Heaven 17 never\ntoured\nD: But what of accessible pop\nsongs?\nG: You need a few to get\nestablished\nJ: There's nothing wrong with pop\nmusic, but if you give people ten\nsingles or ten pop tunes it's not\nenough. You've got to give them\nsomething to think about to give\nthem a good album\nD:I quite agree. Do you reckon\nSheffield Wednesday got robbed on\nSaturday then?\nG: Certainly we came fucking close\nin extra time, i we'd have given an\nextra 5%, just one little extra\npush...\nD: The disallowed goal?\nG: It was disallow able.

    "content": "Opera\nMacbeth Like the contents of the witches'\ncauldron, ENO's production of\nVerdi's Macbeth is a nasty and\nfascinating brew. The main theme\nof this staging is the abuse of\npower; in the programme there are\nquotes from The Prince, and on the\nstage producer David Pountney has\nscattered the trappings of tyranny.\nGrey-uniformed quasi-Nazis and\nsinister, trench coated secret police\nsurround Macbeth, and Banquo\ngoes underground to produce\nsubversive leaflets. While this may\nnot come as a surprise to Coliseum\nregulars (you wouldn't have to\nspend very long in the ENO\nwardrobe to amass a considerable\npile of military uniforms and\nsinister trenchcoats) the treatment\nof the witches is more original. The\ndrab, mischief-making housewives,\nwhere you might have expected\nOTT grotesque rie, locate the action\nfirmly in the sphere of grubby\nreality (despite the distorted\nExperssionist set) rather than on\nsome remote supernatural place.\nIt's a pity that this effect is a little\ncompromised at the beginning of\nAct IV by what appears to be a nod\nin the direction of Pantheism, with\nthe emergence of King Duncan as\nOil and Blood How about this for an idea? Take\nnine pints of my own blood, cast it\ninto the shape of my head, keep it\nin are fig e rated box and pass it off\nas art. That's exactly what Mark\nQuinn has done. He is one of an\nincreasing number of modern artists\nobsessed with bodily fluids and\nfunctions, a movement which\nstarted with the now infamous\n'Pisschrist'. Quinn's work features\nin the Young British Artists II\nexhibition at the Saatchi Collection.\nThe blood head, entitled 'Self,\ngreets you as you enter the gallery.\nIt sits serenely in its chilled box\neyeing the passers by. There is a certain charm to its expression, but\nthe disturbance inherent in the\nconstruction material inspires fear\nand revulsion in the viewer. Equally\ndisturbing is 'You take my breath\naway', a latex second skin in the\nshape of the artist's body. It hangs\nlimply, 'Like a used condom', as if\nthe artist had shed his kin like a snake. It is a frightening reminder\nof the tenuous boundary between\nlife and emptiness. These sinister\ncreations inspire the viewer with a a sort of 'Father Earth' from the\nmidst of a grotto of petrified\nnaturalists. The ending is rather\nfeeble: the dozen branch-carrying\nnew-age waifs who rush on and\nbounce on the royal bed hardly look\ncapable of routing Macbeth's thugs.\nOn the first night, Malcolm\nDonnelly in the title role was\nin it it ally dull-voiced and seemed out\nof his depth, but he soon warmed\nup as the sparks began to fly from\nKristine Ciesinski's Lady Macbeth.\nHer bright, steely voice is ideal for\nthe part and her acting is magnetic.\nAfter a gripping sleepwalking\nscene, she kills herself in the\nshower, daubing the walls with\nbilious green blood. John Hudson\nis fair to middling heroic as\nMacduff; on the strength of his\nMalcolm, Anthony Mee may prove\nvocally more apt when he has a crack at the part later in the run.\nMark Elder does sterling work in\nthe pit (makes him sound like a Formula One mechanic, doesn't it)\nand orchestra and chorus deliver\nhigh-octane performances. This is\ngrand opera with all the stops pulled\nout, and Elder should be well\npleased with his final appearances\nas ENO's music director.\nPatrick Wood.\n\u2022 In rep at the Coliseum, St\nMartin's Lane, until June 26. Box\nOffice 071-836 3161; tickets from\n\u00a36 on the day.\nOh ****.' The bed's not made.\npast these, however, is something\nof a surprise. 20.50 by Richard\nWilson does not feature in the\ncatalogue, but was by far the most\nmemorable exhibit. I look through\nthe door and see a long walkway,\nextending above some kind of hole.\nIt is seemingly suspended in space.\n'Don't touch the sides, because of\nthe oil', the attendant says\ncryptically. Oil, what oil? All of a sudden I looked closer, and\nrealised. I freak out. Even when I knew what was going on I couldn't believe it. The effect that this\nexhibit has is strange, other\nworldly, vertiginous. I would\ndescribe it, but that would spoil\nit\u2014see it for yourself.\nLeaving this exhibition many\npeople would ask, as they so often\ndo after looking at modern works,\n'Is this Art?'. Well, I would reply\n'Who cares?'. It's disturbing, its\nentertaining, and it has to be seen.\nM.A. \u2022 Young British Artists II. The\nSaatchi Collection, 98A Boundary\nRoad (Swiss Cottage). Open\nFri/Sat, 12-6pm. Free.\nCome on luv vies \u2014this is not the 'Bride of Dracula'\nnew insight into the wonder of life\nand the body. Other sculptures on\ndisplay by Quinn are less\ninteresting, rough cast busts of\nhistorical characters made with\nbread dough. They are mildly\npleasing but lack the dark humour\nof Quinn's other works.\nSara Lucas' work proves to be\ndisappointingly uninspiring. A feminist artist, most of her pictures\nwere vast photocopies of Sunday\nSport centre spreads. Amusing as\nthe articles may once have been,\nhere they are simply a statement.\nThat statement is too obvious, the\nmethod too predictable. Don't bother. Before bypassing these\nentirely make sure you stop to have\na quick chuckle at Lucas'\n'Receptacle of lurid things'. What\nis it supposed to mean?\nDon't linger too long in 'The\nRoyal Box'. It only takes ten\nminutes to die at \u201423 degrees. This\nis a large industrial freezer unit\nwhich you walk into at the invitation\nof an attendant. Inside is aU shaped\nwall of ice cubes which provides a death cold alcove in which to stand\nand contemplate existence. This\nwork stands m complete contrast to\nRose Finn-Kelcey's other exhibit,\n'Steam Installation'. Inspiring post\ncyberpunk nightmares of rampant\ntechnology, this dimly lit room\ncontains a large steam producing\ndevice, with a hood. The steam\nremains enclosed by a stream of\ncold air, swirling around, it projects\ndancing images in the spot lights.\nThe dim lighting, ducts and steam\nrecall memories of Bladerunner and\nAlien, our modern day myths.\nShadows appear in the steam as\nother viewers are silhouetted. Who\nsays air conditioning units can't be\ninteresting?\nMark Wallinger paints large\npictures. His two works here are\n'Capital', seven life-size oil\npaintings of homeless people, and\n'Race, Class, Sex'\u2014four race\nhorses. His pictures are well\nexecuted and beautifully painted\nstudies\u2014something which is very\nrare in the world of modern\n'Pretentious bullshit' art. They are\ntechnically good but rather lifeless.\nI was sure that there was a political\nstatement behind them, but I couldn't be bothered to find it. Just\nPage 2 1\n\n"

    "content": "o Editorial\nI am about to set a historical\npre c dent for a Felix Editor: I agree\nwith vast majority of the reforms\nthat Chris Davidson and his\npartners in crime have hammered\ntogether for Imperial College\nUnion.\nNot an earth shattering sentence,\nbut none the less, I am going to\nhave to qualify it. Wednesday night\nsaw the beating through of detailed\nchanges to Imperial College\nUnion's structure. It was meeting\nthat could have been attended by\nfifty five people but was not.\nFundamental changes were\ndiscussed and apart from reporting\non Felix, IC Radio and STOIC no\none else knew about it.\nEven more interesting was the\nvoting: On a vote on the powers of\nthe Entertainments representative,\nthe people effected by the changes\nwere united in opposition, their\nopinions were ignored. It hardly\nseems right people effected should\nbe diss missed in this way.\nBut before any of these decisions\ncan be put into effect, they must\npass through a Union General\nMeeting. This is a gathering that\nevery one is entitled to attend, but\nwill be held on the very last day of\nthe summer term. How can you\nseriously expect such significant\nchanges to be discussed at this badly\nchosen time?\nThe only way to really gauge the\nopinions of the membership of\nImperial College Union is to hold\na referendum. This would serve two\npurposes, firstly it would ensure\nthat every student in College was\nFelix 9 6 8\naware of the changes and\nunderstood the new structure. By\nholding a referendum the aim of\nbetter communication, one of the\nreasons behind the restructuring of\nthe Union, would be clearly\nachieved. Secondly, the changes\nthat are being discussed are\nfundamental, upheavals like this\ncannot be decided by twenty or\nthirty people behind closed doors.\nIt will show the real metal of these\nproposals if their movers can defend\nand encourage support form the\nwhole populous of Imperial.\nThe cost of this action would be\ninsignificant compared to the level\nof support and communication that\ncould be achieved if a referendum\nwas handled properly.lt is argued\nthat referenda reflect weak\ngovernment, I say avoiding a vote\nreveals a weak argument. The\npinion\n2 8 May1993 message must be to Chris and\neveryone who wants these changes\nto happen: Defend yourself, don't hide behind excuses, come out and\nargue your case with the real\nmembers of ICU.\nCredits\nNews: Andrew, Declan Feature:\nDance Club, The Worthy Islamic\nwriter, Rachel 'passion upon\npassion' Basset.

Well done, I'm sure\nyour ingenuity astonishes and\ninspires all of us.\nA member of our security staff\nmust now pay \u00a3200 to replace his\nstolen bike.\nWe strongly feel that turds like\nyourself should be flushed down the\ntoilet at birth.\nYours sincerely,\nFalmouth Keogh Resident.\nDisaster\nDear Editor,\nI read the article on pi of Felix\nIssue 967, 'Shock Horror in\nSouthside Halls' with some interest.\nAlthough it seems that the actual\nelectric shock situation might not\nhave occurred, the story probably\nserved its purpose\u2014to make people\naware of possible 'substandard'\npractices.\nEven if the shock did not occur,\nfrom the examples of electrical\nwiring in Beit Hall, where I live,\nit is not too difficult to imagine such\na scenario.\nFor example, here in the first\nfloor of Beit Hall we have four\n'temporary' lights in the corridor.\nEach light is dangling from an open\ntermination box on the ceiling by\ntwo wires, delicately (?) wrapped\nin electrical tape. The corridor\nabove us has seven lights for the\nsame length of corridor. One light\nblows and our corridor becomes a dark tunnel.\nAnother corridor with similar\n'temporary' lighting has electrical\nwires dangling almost two feet from\nthe ceiling.\nWe are advised that the lighting\nis temporary until the 'new' fire\nalarm system is installed. I have\nbeen here since October 1992 and\nhave not seen any action on the fire\nsystem, or the ceiling (which is an\neyesore\u2014waiting for the fire system\nto be installed) or the lighting\n(waiting for the fire system to be\ninstalled). At the current rate of\nprogress the 'new' fire system will\nbe out of date before it is installed.\n(One wonders about what fire\nprotection system is in place until\nthen).\nAdmittedly the student\naccommodation provided at the\nCollege is reasonably priced for\nLondon, but apart from being\nfunctional, a minimum degree of\nsafety must be maintained. If the\nhalls do meet this minimum\nstandard, it must be only just...\nYours carefully,\nBruce Cartwright,\nBeit Hall Resident.\nCat's Eyes\nCannes Film Festival\nThis blatant excuse for film\nplugging has been relatively low\nkey this year. OK so Barry 'I wear\nmy hairstyle back to front' Norman\ngot the centre pages in one of the\ntabloids and did his usual fifty\nminute rant on BBC1. But where\nhas all the front page coverage\ngone? Answer: it's with Madonna,\nwherever she is.\nHon Sec RIP\nWith the fourth and final sabbatical\nto be elected, Imperial College may\nface the death of a current one.\nDom 'Boyz is not the magazine for\nme but Cosmopolitan is' Wilkinson\ncould be the last Hon Sec ever.\nNext years Hon Sec could possibly\nbe known as the Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) and will have\na bit of a change in job description.\nBut the change has not been\nfinalised by Council yet. The new\njob description is patchy and the\ntitle may change.\nSo how can you have an election\nfor a post that doesn't really exist?\nEnd Of Exams Finished your exams? (Aren't you\na lucky bastard!) Bored? Want to\nhave a rant? Think it's time to air\nyour views now that you're leaving\nso no reprisals can be carried\nagainst you? Well instead of\nthinking about writing a letter or a feature or a review for Felix, GET\nOFF YOUR FUCKING ASS\nAND DO SOMETHING.\nReviews\nInteresting to read what Martin\nGodet of Civ Eng 2 had to say about\nthe music reviews in his letter last\nweek. Some of it is true (the main\nreviewer is NOT pretentious\nthough, just off his trolley allegedly)\nand I can't help agreeing with some\nof Martin's arguments.\nBut what about the other reviews\n(Theatre / Film / Opera)? Does\nanyone read them?\nThe Cabinet Re-Shuffle\nI have changed this bloody article\nthree times so far, because more\ninformation is being made available\nas the deadline for Cat's Eyes\napproaches.\nThe last est on this cheery\nThursday morning is that Lamont's mother has blabbed to someone that\nhe has resigned. The Government\nPress Office are claiming that they\nhave had no resignation from him.\nObiturary and update next week.\nSpitting Image\nThis programme has come a long\nway from the days of saga's like\nThe President's Brain and each\nseries just keeps getting better. New\npuppets worth watching are Chris\nEubank, Jilly Cooper and the\npretentious extras that are used for\njust about everything. All the\nclassics are still there; The PM, the\nChancellor, the Royal Family.\nOne new move is the inclusion of\nmore swearing and sexually related\njokes, hence the transmission time\nof 10.45pm. But these add to the\nhumour, I think, not degrade it as\nyou might think.\nThird episode this Sunday.\nP.J.

It\ncould not stay uncovered for long,\nbut I hid it nonetheless, for I was\nashamed. The fact was that I was\nand still am, a mechanical\nincompetent.\nTo some people machines qui ed y whisper their most intimate\nproblems, to me they just whirr and\nclick. Other fortunate individuals\ncan look at an ailing mechanism and\nsay, the problem must be here. I would not know where to begin.\nThis fact is not crippling normally,\nbut, I was about to begin a course\nat the foremost Science and\nTechnology College in the United\nKingdom; it appeared that I had\noverstepped the limit somewhat.\nLectures were fine, everyone has\nthem, everyone can cope with them,\nbut then came laboratory work. No\nmore could one of your mates do\nall the work while you chatted, it\nwas three solid hours puzzling over\nhuge mazes of metal. Everyone\naround you muttered\nenthusiastically about how fast the\nspeed of light really was and how\nclose you were getting to the real\nanswer. OK, so you know the\nanswer, why bother doing the\nexperiment then?\nLife was not as bad as it first\nseemed because we had supervisors\nto help us along the way. That was\nnice as long as you spoke to the\nright one. In general Lab\nsupervisors came in three flavours\nall linked by a common thread of\nstupidity. The first kind were\nhateful: You are stupid and I will\nnot answer your question because\nto speak to you is far below my\nintellectual capacity, was the\nmessage you received from their\ncontemptuous faces. It was even\nworse when they spoke to you; 'No,\nwork it out for yourself that is what\nyou are here for'\n'But I don't understand why..'\n'Why don't you try thinking\nabout it then?' is a typical exchange\nof views.\nThe others were sympathetic,\nattempting to help above and\nbeyond the call of duty: 'Well why\ndon't you try it like this. .No not like\nthat, like this...No, no, no, the\nother way up.. .Wait! the blue one\nDon't make me do any more\nnot the red one...It's OKI 'll do it\nfor you'. This was worse, they\nknew you were stupid, you knew\nyou were stupid, but no one was\ngoing to admit it. As my temper\ngrew a little unstable, I kept saying\nto myself, they think they are\nhelping, indulge them, they don't mean to patron is e you.\nThe final category were easily\nidentified, everything they said\nbegan with the phrase: 'That is a very interesting question..'. It was\nheartening to know that someone\nhad less knowledge or interest in\nwhat was happening than yourself.\nBut at least they where aware of\nbasic mechanics, something which\nI was painfully ignorant. For\nexample looking for fringes in a light diffraction: 'Turn the dial until\nthe fringes come into focus', 'I can't see them', 'Keep on going.. No, if\nyou unscrew that nut any more the\napparatus will fall to pieces'.\nMost dreaded of all was\nelectronics, firs dy you had to attend\na lecture course before starting.\nPersonally, I believe anyone who\ncan stand up for fifty minutes and\ntalk about electrical circuits should\nbe put out of their misery as soon\nas possible. But talk they did, and\nexperiments, please!\ntalk, and talk, a blank appears in my\nlife when I look back on that time.\nIt was as if someone had gone and\nstolen the sound track to a home\nmade movie, I was there, people\nwalked around, pointed to things,\nbut the words and meaning are just\nabsent.\nThen came the lab. Each and\nevery one of us was given what\nlooked like a lego building block\nand told this was going to be the\nplace where our electronic dreams\nwould be created. A few hours later\na primary-coloured, multi-legged\nspider had appeared on my lego\nblock and it didn't work. Lego was\nmore fun when you had building\nbricks and little men to play with.\nI tried begging for help, A superior\nsupervisor walked over and stated\nwhat was glaringly obvious to him;\n'Well you put that wire here and it\nshould work'. Of course I slap my\nskull and curse myself with new\nArchimedean insight, all you have\nto do is put all the wires in all the\nholes and one variation is bound to\nwork.\nBut as the saying goes, to really\nfuck things up requires a computer.\nAgain I was 'challenged' by firstly\na lack of knowledge and then\ninquisitiveness that less charitable\npeople called nosiness. The result\nmeant I was frequently floundering\naround in the deep end. Take this\ncase, 'Why does this not work?'\n'You haven't formatted your\nflip-flops'\n'But why do you have to do that?'\n'Because the initial set up drivers\ncan't interface the memory cached\nhard disk without the pre setup\ncode'\n'Ah, what does that mean?' and so\non.\nOnce it did work, it was a moment of glory, triumph and\npassion. I stood up next to my\nterminal and shouted 'Yes, it\nworked, at last, it has printed, My\nname is Jonty, all the way down the\nscreen'. It was very quiet in the rest\nof the Lab, in one careless moment\nI had become the focus of all the\ncontempt, these bespectacled\nterminal tap per s could muster.\nAfter three years studying here,\nI send out a call. Was I really the\nonly one? Did anyone else just like\nthe ideas of science but not the\nharsh reality? If there is anyone\nelse, please don't give up hope,\nbecause you are not alone.\nPage 8\n\n"

Having two smallish\ncharities, and two larger ones, it\nmay be that there are some of you\nwho don't know where the money\nfrom next year's Beer Festival,\nHypnosis, Hit squad etc, will be\ngoing. So here, just for you, is a quick rundown on where your hard-earned cash disappears. My apologies if this is a bit hard-going,\nbut I have tried to use the charities'\nown words...\nMencap\nOver one million people in the UK\nhave some form of learning\ndisability (aka mental handicap).\nMencap is committed to providing\nhigh quality services, advice and\nsupport, enabling people with\nlearning disabilities to make a positive contribution to the\ncommunity, and to make the most\nof life. Sounds very worthy, doesn't it? But what do they actually do?\nMencap provides over 400 homes\nfor people with learning disabilities;\nhas set up an employment service\nto overcome prejudice, ignorance\nand fear; and on top of all this,\noffers training at three residential\ncolleges.\nBIBIC\nFull name British Institute for Brain\nInjured Children, BIBIC is\ndedicated to (as you may have\nguessed) helping children with\nbrain-injuries to improve their lives.\nThe most severe brain-injury is\nprobably 'profound coma', whilst\nthe least is probably in children with\nmild reading and learning\ndifficulties. On acceptance onto the\nprogramme, each child's abilities\nare assessed in the areas of vision,\nhearing, understanding, touch,\nmobility, speech and manual\ncompetence. Using a combination\nof techniques, BIBIC manages such\nfeats as teaching children, unable to\ndo more than creep on their tummy,\nto walk, talk and read. Listed under\n'victories' in Bibic's quarterly\nnewsletter, I found such moving\nstories as that of Alan Dimmock77 months on a Bibic programme\nhas taught him to walk and talk,\nFULL SCC MEETING\nUDH 6pm2.6.93 All Chairmen & Treasurers\nold and new should attend\nELECTIONS \u2022 MONEY\nSocial colours nominations by Tuesday\nlunchtime to the SCC Exec pigeonhole\nWanna collect at Johnny Mathis or\nVictoria Wood? Gonna be around\nin September? Or have you finished\nyour exams, closed that revision file\nfor the last time, and want\nsomething to take your mind off that\nlong wait for the results? Then read\non...\nThe Spastics Society has got\nlicences to collect at the Albert Hall\nfor both Johnny Mathis (14 - 16\nSeptember) and Victoria Wood (21\n- 26 Sept, inclusive), with free entry\nto see the show. Plus, a little closer,\nthey are holding their City Street\nFlag Day on Thursday June 17th, and would appreciate any can-rat der s that are exam-free and can\nspare a few minutes for a good\ncause.\nJust so as you know, the Spastics\nSociety is an organisation whose\nprimary concern is to serve and\npromote the interests of people with\ncerebral palsy, which is a disabling\ncondition of impaired muscle-coordination caused before or at\nbirth, or in the early years of\nchildhood by damage to, or\nmal development in, the portion of\nthe brain which controls movement\nand posture. (That may be a bit\nwordy, but don't blame me, it's their terminology!).\nIf you want to collect either at the\nFlag Day, or at one of the shows\nin September, then pop along to the\nRag Office, and speak to anyone\nyou can find! Alternatively, you can\nleave a message in the Rag\npigeonhole in the Union Office, or\ncome along to the weekly meeting\nin the Ents lounge, on Friday at\nl pm. when previously he was only able\nto crawl.\nTurning Point\nTurning Point is the largest national\ncharity helping people with drink,\ndrug and mental health problems.\nIts network of over 40 projects\nprovides residential rehabilitation,\nday care and street level advice,\ninformation and counselling\nservices. Turning Point's philosophy is based on the principle\nthat there is no set cure or single\ntreatment for these problems, just\nas there is no one type of person\nwho develops them, and no single\nreason why. As a housing\nassociation, Turning Point can also\nact as a development agent to\nmanage the acquisition and\ndevelopment of properties for its\nprojects.\nBLISS\nBliss is a charity concerned with the\nwelfare of all newborn babies. Bliss\nbelieves that all babies have the\nright to the very best start in life,\nbut is aware that often this does not\nhappen. The statistics are that 1 in\n10 newborn babies need special\ncare, whilst 1 in 50 needs specialist\nintensive care, and whilst these are\ntheoretically available to every\nbaby, the allocation of resources is\noften haphazard, despite the\ndedicated care of medical staff.\nBliss has donated vital equipment to\nover 204 hospitals, and also\nsponsors the training of specialist\nmedical staff.\nLocal charities are chosen by the\nRag committee out of those that\napply to us for cash; this year's money for local charities has not yet\nbeen distributed, watch this space\nto f nd out where it goes! I hope that\nthis gives you all a slightly better\nidea of what happens to money that\nis collected or raised under the\nname of Rag (as opposed to that\ncollected for specific charities).\nThese are the charities chosen by\nYOU at last week's Rag meeting,\nI hope you are as glad as I am that\nwe are able to help so many people\nthrough giving time, if not money,\nto Rag.\nWANTED\nEAGER BOTTOMS TO STAFF BALLOT\nBOXES IN THE FORTHCOMING\nSABBATICAL ELECTIONS\n7th/8 th JUNE\nEARN NEARLY \u00a340 OVER 2 DAYS\nCONTACT DOMINIC\nIN THE UNION OFFICE\nPage 7\n\n"
